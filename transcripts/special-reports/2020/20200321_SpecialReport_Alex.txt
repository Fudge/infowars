[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  [Music]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  [Music]
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.655]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:56.001]  So what do you say to Americans who are scared though?
[00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:02.866]  I guess nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions, as you witnessed, who are scared right now.
[00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.149]  What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?
[00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.390]  I say that you're a terrible reporter.
[00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.191]  That's what I say.
[00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:16.196]  I think it's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people.
[00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.979]  The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.464]  And you're doing sensationalism and the same with NBC and Comcast.
[00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:28.446]  I don't call it Comcast, I call it Comcast.
[00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.188]  Let me just tell you something.
[00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.791]  That's really bad reporting.
[00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:37.093]  And you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism.
[00:01:37.553 --> 00:01:38.494]  Let's see if it works.
[00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:40.476]  It might, and it might not.
[00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.378]  I happen to feel good about it, but who knows?
[00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:44.579]  I've been right a lot.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.220]  Let's see what happens.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.540]  John?
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.642]  Let me come back to the science and the logistics area.
[00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:53.946]  Shamey, the units that were ordered, are they for clinical trials, or are they for distribution to the general public?
[00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:54.687]  I don't think so.
[00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:58.583]  Essentially, you've done that in California.
[00:01:58.603 --> 00:01:59.624]  You've done that in New York.
[00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:00.844]  Those are really two hotbeds.
[00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:04.386]  Those are probably the two hottest of them all in terms of hot spots.
[00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:13.431]  I don't think so, because you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they're watching it on television, but they don't have the same problems.
[00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.932]  They don't have, by any means, the same problem.
[00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:20.494]  New York, California, Miami, the governor's doing an excellent job.
[00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:23.416]  Governor DeSantis in Florida.
[00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:34.946]  Uh, we have some pretty hot spots in Florida too, but we're a general and the state of Washington, of course, but that was largely if you look at it, it was one nursing home that had problems like you wouldn't believe.
[00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:40.031]  So now we're working with the governors and I don't think you'll, I don't think we'll ever find that necessary.
[00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:48.575]  You've said we can do anything for 15 days, but give it to us straight.
[00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.976]  Isn't this going to be longer than 15 days?
[00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:54.858]  How long do you think people should expect to be at home, essentially?
[00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:59.119]  Well, what you're talking about is our 15 Days to Stop the Spread initiative.
[00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.241]  We're telling people that we really want them to avoid gatherings of 10 or more.
[00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:05.862]  We want them to avoid any unnecessary travel.
[00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:10.603]  We want them to work from home, if at all possible, or not go in.
[00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:17.586]  And the reason why we framed it this way is because when we look at the data, our numbers are where Italy's were two to three weeks ago.
[00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:20.987]  So we really have a choice to make right now as a nation.
[00:03:21.487 --> 00:03:24.928]  Do we want to go the way of Italy and see our numbers increase rapidly?
[00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:36.330]  Or do we want to go the way of South Korea and China who aggressively leaned in the mitigation measures and were actually able to level off their peak and are now seeing significantly decreased numbers of cases?
[00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.371]  We really feel like if we can get America to all pitch in...
[00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:48.315]  We feel like if we can get America to all pitch in for the next 15 days, we can flatten the curve, which is a term that you've been hearing a lot, not overwhelm our healthcare systems.
[00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.056]  So 15 days is enough?
[00:03:51.336 --> 00:04:00.341]  15 days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through, but we really need to lean into it now so that we can bend the curve in the next 15 days.
[00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.502]  And at that point, we'll reassess.
[00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:08.583]   Okay, let me ask you about a new study that was published just yesterday in the New England Journal of Medi...
[00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:09.943]  [gun cocks]
[00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:11.783]  [gun cocks]
[00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.942]  [music]
[00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:18.543]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:21.943]   "I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?"
[00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:24.195]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:31.880]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.542]  And we are live on this Saturday, March 21st, 2020 transmission.
[00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:41.889]  We're going to be live here for at least the next two hours.
[00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.570]  We have two very informative special guests for you.
[00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.190]  This is going to be commercial free.
[00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.991]  We're not going to go to commercials for radio and TV stations out there.
[00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:58.413]  Though we have commandeered the main radio satellites and TV satellites that send out our retransmission.
[00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:10.230]  The satellite uplink on the roof and we have taken over all the internet streams at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and Band.Video of the retransmission streams.
[00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.331]  So we are live at 2.05 Central Time, 3.05 Eastern.
[00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:27.033]  That would be noon, 12.05 Pacific, 1.05 Mountain on this March 21st Saturday transmission.
[00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:28.233]  I want people to know we are live.
[00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:35.788]  I knew there'd be a ton of news, even after I got off air yesterday, and even after I finished watching The War Room with Owen Schroeder, that needed to be covered.
[00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.411]  And this is the fourth night in a row that I really can't sleep.
[00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:40.872]  Maybe I had two hours.
[00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:45.435]  And I appreciate the crew that's already, a skeleton crew, working seven days a week right now.
[00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:54.282]  At least 14 hours a day, they've all come in, a large part of the crew, to cover all of the insanity of what's unfolding.
[00:05:55.663 --> 00:06:00.724]  The National Institute of Health says up to 70,000 cases next week, 20% of population now on lockdown.
[00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:03.904]  Economy deteriorating fast.
[00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:06.125]  And that's the bottom one's really the big one.
[00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:14.186]  Because we are an industrialized society, 90% urban and city, 10% rural.
[00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.907]  National studies show about half of those that are rural are self-sufficient.
[00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:22.408]  From the Great Depression, the majority of Americans were self-sufficient.
[00:06:22.768 --> 00:06:23.308]  Today, 5% are.
[00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:31.207]  The US economy deteriorating faster than anticipated as 80 million Americans force stay at home.
[00:06:32.488 --> 00:06:37.791]  And the left and the globalists and the EU are saying, we want 18 months, a year and a half.
[00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:40.033]  China's back to business now.
[00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.374]  They're just ignoring the virus.
[00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:42.995]  And they're having some deaths.
[00:06:43.055 --> 00:06:44.235]  And it's a dangerous virus.
[00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:48.518]  But compared to many viruses, it's not that deadly to target the elderly, which is sad.
[00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.060]  But you kill the economy.
[00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:57.424]  University studies show up to 7 million people starved to death during the Great Depression.
[00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:04.710]  That's when we were, again, more than 50% self-sufficient.
[00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:07.552]  90% rural.
[00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:09.853]  It happens now.
[00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:11.915]  War of the Worlds.
[00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:14.917]  And there was a big article out I saw on Drudge.
[00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:28.996]  Where they had quotes from inside the White House mirroring what we've learned, that he's being pressured to basically bring in martial law and then stop the riots and looting that come once people run out of food and water.
[00:07:29.937 --> 00:07:40.224]  So, they're creating a much bigger problem and it's the left, it's the globalists, it's academia, it's big tech, it's the authoritarian EU, it's the chi-coms using this to seize power.
[00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:47.169]  Now let me tell you the big news that I'm going to cover in quadrants today, in big slices.
[00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.782]  Let me give you the good news first.
[00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:53.123]  I already knew this.
[00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:54.263]  You already knew this.
[00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:55.044]  It's like knowledge.
[00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:56.505]  You wonder, why did I think of that?
[00:07:56.525 --> 00:08:09.932]  I've known that for 30, 40 years, that zinc lozenges, or just zinc you ingest, is 98% effective against any virus, if you've got it at the levels you need.
[00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:12.553]  But you gotta have it up front.
[00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:19.838]  But then I saw him on the news saying, there's no treatment, there's no prevention, there's no nothing.
[00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:27.304]  So I went, and I spent last night, once I got back up, went to bed about 10.30, got up about 2 a.m., couldn't sleep.
[00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:45.516]   And I spent two hours of the time I spent on that, I spent hours up with that research, reading Harvard, Vanderbilt, John Hopkins, Oxford, Major Japanese universities.
[00:08:47.997 --> 00:08:52.139]  We posted just four of the studies and then a big boil down by Oxford.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.421]  All of them on Infowars.com right now.
[00:08:57.122 --> 00:08:59.123]  This is valuable information, we're gonna cover it.
[00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:04.065]  But it'll take you two hours, I can speed read, to read these.
[00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:06.346]  Two hours.
[00:09:09.508 --> 00:09:10.468]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.190]  Zinc coats the cells where viruses can't get in.
[00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:23.589]  And if some get through the wall or through the membrane, they can't replicate if there's zinc inside of the cells.
[00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.010]  What do you think chloroquil does?
[00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:29.732]  It forces zinc into the cells.
[00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:35.354]  And that's the drug they admit is really effective against it.
[00:09:35.454 --> 00:09:40.616]  So Oxford University report on documented antiviral effects on zinc in human body.
[00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:44.118]  And then there's four studies posted under their boil down under it.
[00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:48.520]  By our great crew working around the clock.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:55.706]  So it's the most important 40 pages or so you're probably ever going to read.
[00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:58.008]  I suggest you read this.
[00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:12.380]  And then when you see them on the news telling you there's nothing to protect you, there's no vaccine, there's no drugs, there's... Chloroquine is documented to be super effective.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.902]  But all it does is push zinc into the cells.
[00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:20.070]  So if you had enough zinc in your body already, the study show wouldn't have to happen.
[00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.673]  So we're gonna go over all of those coming up today.
[00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:27.773]  That's the good news.
[00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:30.615]  We're gonna take your calls as well.
[00:10:35.117 --> 00:10:36.618]  Then let me get to the bad news.
[00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:51.686]   Governments in trouble and governments that are authoritarian are all using it and setting the precedent for total martial law 1984 style, because they're in trouble politically.
[00:10:52.907 --> 00:10:54.047]  And here's the evidence of that.
[00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:55.787]  Listen to these headlines.
[00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:00.648]  Israel debates, quote, total suspension of individual freedom in the Knesset.
[00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:10.731]  As we said before, the 1984 scenario, and that's what they said in the Knesset, is likely soon to come to your country in neighborhood New Year, if not already.
[00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:13.751]  And then you read the stuff that happened in the Knesset.
[00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:15.772]  I was watching the video this morning, but most of it was in Hebrew.
[00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:20.747]  And I mean, it is like, we need tyranny.
[00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:21.888]  We need to arrest everyone.
[00:11:21.908 --> 00:11:30.533]  We need cell phones that we already have with our shin bet to track people in live time and make sure they don't get within 10 feet of each other.
[00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:34.052]   and if anyone gets within 10 feet of each other, the cell phones know and will arrest you.
[00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:42.452]  Benjamin Netanyahu, who I'm not even against.
[00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:43.292]  It's just a fact.
[00:11:43.813 --> 00:11:44.813]  He lost an election.
[00:11:45.173 --> 00:11:48.714]  He can barely hold power in the parliament because he's got a coalition of other groups.
[00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:49.975]  It's not a two-party system.
[00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:56.197]  It's like Merkel's super unpopular, but she can stay in power because she always makes new deals with other groups because she's still got control of the government.
[00:11:58.678 --> 00:11:59.638]  His wife's been indicted.
[00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:00.419]  He's in deep trouble.
[00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:10.059]   And even Haratz says, here's the headline, Netanyahu is using coronavirus to hold onto power.
[00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:11.619]  Here's another one.
[00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:13.779]  They've had a year and a half of the yellow vest.
[00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:17.060]  Macron's approval rating is in the teens.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.741]  Like 17% last time I said.
[00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:19.921]  He's totally hated.
[00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.261]  There's a revolution against him at every level.
[00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:25.122]  And now he says you can't go on the street without my authorization.
[00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:35.164]   Thousands of French citizens ignore quarantine as cops issue 39,000 citations for violating lockdown, but will not give homeless, migrants, or invading Muslims A ticket.
[00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:36.385]  That's in the news.
[00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:37.125]  Neither will Sweden.
[00:12:37.185 --> 00:12:38.286]  They are gods.
[00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:39.926]  But the well-behaved French?
[00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:40.907]  You're here to submit.
[00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:42.768]  It's like, well-behaved Americans?
[00:12:42.788 --> 00:12:43.528]  You're here to submit.
[00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:48.270]  Macron protests take to Paris streets in defiance of coronavirus lockdown.
[00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:53.012]  French police lockdowns in comparison to Yellow Vest to fight coronavirus.
[00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:54.493]  It's, it's, it's incredible.
[00:12:55.373 --> 00:12:57.654]  So, and the police are on their sides.
[00:12:57.874 --> 00:12:58.534]  They know what's happened.
[00:12:58.554 --> 00:12:59.595]  They're speaking out against Macron.
[00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:04.639]  They're like, why are we gonna keep our own people off the street when they're, but let people flood in?
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.921]  Just like they announced in Sweden last week.
[00:13:07.722 --> 00:13:18.972]  All air travel is shut down in or out of the country, unless it's the UN-funded, Soros-backed planes that land four or five times a day, jumbo jets from the Middle East and Africa with military-age men being disgorged.
[00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:21.834]  That will continue, and they are not to be searched.
[00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:27.439]  And all over the country, the homeless are exempt from the curfews and anything else, because they are gods.
[00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:30.689]  Now, where'd all this come from?
[00:13:30.729 --> 00:13:32.130]  Well, Xi Jinping.
[00:13:33.471 --> 00:13:34.512]  Xi Jinping.
[00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:37.074]  Xi Jinping.
[00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:44.380]  He just lost his year-long battle with the Taiwan protesters.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.942]  It was spreading revolt all over mainland China.
[00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:49.384]  His own party wanted to remove him.
[00:13:51.285 --> 00:13:58.571]  And so here comes this virus that we know is man-made out of the Wuhan Bioweapons Laboratory that uses the exact same symbol as the Umbrella Corporation.
[00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:02.873]  In zombie horror movie?
[00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.134]  Oh yeah, they're in your face.
[00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:22.719]  And... Every socialist, every communist, every globalist government, every globalist city, every globalist corporation shuts everything down on the surface to, again, create the hysteria.
[00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:28.080]  It's time for America to recognize, acknowledge the Chinese president is not our friend.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.821]  You know, that's a very intelligent headline there.
[00:14:32.637 --> 00:14:33.639]  Well, stating the fact.
[00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:42.195]  So, that's what's really happening here and now I saw it on the news this morning on Fox.
[00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:57.847]  Phone companies are looking to work with the government to make sure that people don't congregate more than 10 people, or it'll call the police when they see the cell phones get close, and it'll make sure social distancing you stay within 10 feet or the police will be called.
[00:14:58.427 --> 00:15:05.950]  Exactly what China rolled out a few months ago in Wuhan, then China-wide is now spreading to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan.
[00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.272]  Europe, the United States, England, it's all seamlessly prepared.
[00:15:10.532 --> 00:15:13.513]  They didn't just come up with this last month or last year.
[00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:15.694]  It's Disease X, the UN said was coming.
[00:15:16.014 --> 00:15:20.116]  It's Bill and Melinda Gates, 65 million from a coronavirus four months ago.
[00:15:20.396 --> 00:15:32.762]  Tabletop Drill, it's all the TV shows, the movies on Netflix and on other channels and in the theaters about pandemics and mass death being imminent, airing in December and January.
[00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:37.432]  A new Discovery Channel and history shows about the end of the world.
[00:15:37.692 --> 00:15:44.055]  All of it produced and ready for a year in the pipeline for this big move.
[00:15:44.115 --> 00:15:48.177]  Now you can talk all day about what is this really for?
[00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:49.498]  What's the end game of it?
[00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:51.178]  But it sells the technocracy.
[00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.839]  It sells surveillance.
[00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:54.880]  It sells forced inoculation.
[00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:59.222]  It shuts down the small companies, empowers the big ones.
[00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:01.103]  It's a vertical integration.
[00:16:04.457 --> 00:16:11.041]  Not because of the good news, but God gave us things that boost our immune system.
[00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:13.122]  And the system doesn't want that known.
[00:16:13.142 --> 00:16:21.547]  They want to lie to you and say nano-silver never did anything good, the UN says.
[00:16:22.888 --> 00:16:27.831]  The UN also says communism is good and capitalism is bad, and that there's global warming and you need to pay carbon taxes to Lord Rothschild.
[00:16:28.797 --> 00:16:31.379]  And they also said, nope, zinc doesn't help you.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.201]  New York Times has an article.
[00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:34.882]  Total lie!
[00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.844]  Zinc is so established.
[00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:40.227]  I mean, look, vitamin D is very important, silver is very important.
[00:16:40.507 --> 00:16:43.569]  They're all just bolstering defenses.
[00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:44.510]  None of them are a panacea.
[00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:50.475]  But zinc is king, daddy.
[00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.697]  I mean, it's as close as you're gonna get.
[00:16:53.197 --> 00:16:53.918]  Be careful, though.
[00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:57.101]  High-level dosing of it is not good for your kidneys.
[00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:00.426]  But it is exactly that.
[00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:07.688]  And I've got the studies on the nebulizers and putting it into the lungs and what they do all over the world, but they won't let U.S.
[00:17:07.748 --> 00:17:12.770]  hospitals do it because big pharma wants more dead people and they want you to buy their expensive drugs.
[00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:17.652]  Chloroquine is very inexpensive.
[00:17:17.692 --> 00:17:19.433]  Bayer just gave away millions of dosages of it.
[00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:20.773]  The U.S.
[00:17:20.793 --> 00:17:21.313]  government, good.
[00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:24.775]  But see, why are they not promoting it?
[00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:25.775]  Because it's cheap!
[00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:31.127]  And again, it's a drug that pushes zinc into the body.
[00:17:31.788 --> 00:17:32.648]  Didn't have enough zinc?
[00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.212]  Well, they got drugs that'll pull it out of your tissues and force it into there.
[00:17:39.653 --> 00:17:41.313]  It's just better to have plenty of it already.
[00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:45.556]  I already take, you know, bio-mineral fusion that has some zinc in it.
[00:17:45.576 --> 00:17:48.738]  But let me tell you, I've been taking zinc, because I remembered this, now this is getting so serious.
[00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.860]  I took 30 milligrams of it.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.801]  That's about three times the recommended daily dose this morning.
[00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:00.614]  I mean, just the mental effect of vitamins and minerals is crazy.
[00:18:00.874 --> 00:18:02.116]  That's why we call it the real red pill.
[00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:11.464]  Our vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, the highest quality with a big dose of zinc in it, and then the preglanone under it, look into what that is.
[00:18:13.005 --> 00:18:18.610]  Doctors were prescribing that for almost 100 years, but it doesn't cost a lot of money, so they don't prescribe it anymore.
[00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:21.853]  Big drug companies, though, want it banned.
[00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:27.289]  Because of what it does for so many people on so many fronts.
[00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.012]  That's why it's called the Real Red Pill, the Red Red Pill Plus.
[00:18:30.973 --> 00:18:35.276]  Which, by the way, is 50% off right now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:18:35.617 --> 00:18:37.258]  And I want to be infinity clear.
[00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:41.337]  It is not meant to treat or diagnose the novel coronavirus.
[00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:51.778]  And oxygen is not meant to let humans live.
[00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:52.826]  You do not need oxygen.
[00:18:52.846 --> 00:18:54.747]  The FDA says you cannot say you need oxygen.
[00:18:54.988 --> 00:18:55.888]  You do not need oxygen.
[00:18:56.128 --> 00:18:58.970]  Actually, don't put a bag around your head or get in the garage with carbon monoxide, you'll die.
[00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.011]  You've actually got to have oxygen.
[00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:14.581]  But the point is, is that it doesn't actually treat or cure it, because it's when you have, in all these studies, I'm going to show you from top scientists, not me them, that when you don't have enough of it and you're deficient, that's how the viruses get in.
[00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:17.763]  Which I've always said, because I read the literature.
[00:19:20.313 --> 00:19:23.136]  So much of cancer is viral deficiencies.
[00:19:23.176 --> 00:19:24.797]  Look up zinc and colon cancer.
[00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:27.840]  Look up zinc and lung cancer.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.544]  It's just insane how much of this, and how the U.N.
[00:19:32.564 --> 00:19:41.151]  admits almost 3 billion people alive have a mental disability or have been mentally reduced.
[00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.374]  You read the actual quotes, even on Wikipedia about iodine.
[00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.916]  Pull up iodine deficiency on Wikipedia and it links to the U.N.
[00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:47.356]  and everything.
[00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:47.737]  Admits it.
[00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:55.814]  That almost 3 billion people have a mental disability or lower IQ because of iodine deficiency.
[00:19:58.015 --> 00:20:01.597]  Does the news tell you iodine massively boost your immunity?
[00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:03.218]  Do they tell you zinc does it?
[00:20:03.398 --> 00:20:19.636]   Well, I spent over an hour this morning, over an hour this morning, typing into search engines, Bing and Google and others, zinc And coronavirus, and there was almost nothing.
[00:20:19.716 --> 00:20:29.860]  I found local doctors in Oklahoma, California, and New York talking about Nobel Prizes and stuff for it, and it was hidden in little local news.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:30.721]  Nothing.
[00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:38.664]  But I typed in zinc antiviral, and that's where there's literally thousands of studies.
[00:20:40.065 --> 00:20:41.745]  Thousands of studies.
[00:20:44.046 --> 00:20:44.887]  So here's how it works.
[00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:47.208]  You need oxygen to live.
[00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:56.219]  If you don't have it and then you asphyxiate and then your brain dies for more than about four or five minutes, you're never going to come back.
[00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:56.740]  You're dead.
[00:20:57.401 --> 00:21:00.924]  Unless you fall into icy water that they've proven can freeze you up to like five, six hours.
[00:21:00.964 --> 00:21:05.609]  They've pulled kids out and they've lived because they put them in suspended animation, kind of quasi-froze their cells.
[00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:08.673]  So the metabolic system, you know, shut down and they were able to get them out.
[00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:12.073]  But if you get strangled, four minutes, you're dead on average.
[00:21:12.554 --> 00:21:13.214]  It's the same thing.
[00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:17.718]  So then once you're strangled and dead, I can't put oxygen into you and make you live.
[00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:31.910]  It's totally true that if you already have the coronavirus, it's already spread in your body from all the literature I've read, my view, and you already have it in your lungs and stuff, and you've already got it, well, it's like, well, no, no, now the zinc's not gonna help, now the vitamin D's not gonna help.
[00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.071]  It got in, it replicated.
[00:21:33.432 --> 00:21:40.786]   Doing it after the fact, there's actually a bunch of studies that it helps, it's one of the treatments, but And then they aerosolize it and the doctors shoot it down in the lungs and all that.
[00:21:41.487 --> 00:21:42.167]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:21:42.207 --> 00:21:43.468]  I'm just reading what they say.
[00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:46.611]  But you need to have it before.
[00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:48.872]  You need the oxygen before you die.
[00:21:49.113 --> 00:21:52.035]  You need the water before you die of dehydration.
[00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:54.257]  You need the food before you die of starvation.
[00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:58.560]  You need the knowledge before you fall into the pit.
[00:21:59.297 --> 00:22:04.027]   Your kid needs to know to not go out of the backyard and get in the white van with the man that offered him the
[00:22:04.027 --> 00:22:08.297]   candy and the puppy before he gets grabbed and taken and put in a snuff film.
[00:22:08.297 --> 00:22:21.816]   So see they have these, these lawyers that write all this stuff and they know how
[00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.297]  to deceive you.
[00:22:23.297 --> 00:22:24.957]  (heart beating)
[00:22:24.942 --> 00:22:28.603]  I never said nanosilver was a cure or a treatment.
[00:22:30.262 --> 00:22:39.352]  I said at point-blank range in the studies, the coronavirus family, and I was showing you the studies, up against it, like I said, these studies, zinc has this electrical charge and fries them.
[00:22:39.892 --> 00:22:40.793]  Same thing with silver.
[00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:41.835]  Same thing with copper.
[00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:43.456]  You know, you send electricity down the copper.
[00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:45.418]  It's conductive.
[00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:46.760]  That's what these studies say.
[00:22:48.882 --> 00:22:51.205]  But they just said, I said, if you've got this, you're fine.
[00:22:51.265 --> 00:22:51.965]  No, you're not fine.
[00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:58.888]  And they don't have something, if you've got a run-down immune system and you've already got it, that can save you if your body doesn't defeat it.
[00:22:59.348 --> 00:23:01.469]  But see, that's how they misrepresent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:08.472]  Russian scientists have created a material to kill the flu virus and they hope it could protect against coronavirus.
[00:23:09.012 --> 00:23:09.813]  What is the material?
[00:23:09.853 --> 00:23:10.573]  Who knows what it is?
[00:23:11.013 --> 00:23:14.655]  There's so much stuff, folks, and they just don't want you to know about it.
[00:23:16.352 --> 00:23:17.653]  Oh, Nanosilver.
[00:23:18.194 --> 00:23:18.914]  Oh, Nanosilver!
[00:23:19.174 --> 00:23:22.877]  The Pentagon certified it in 2005 and uses it.
[00:23:24.418 --> 00:23:26.019]  And that's what I said on air.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.221]  I didn't say I had a cure.
[00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.283]  I didn't say I had a treatment.
[00:23:31.223 --> 00:23:36.688]  I read the Pentagon documents that say the same things the Russians are saying and the same thing Newsweek is saying.
[00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:41.170]   But because I'm Alex Jones, I was out at Zilker Park.
[00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.090]  There weren't as many people.
[00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.731]  There were some there being thought criminals.
[00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:44.311]  A woman ran up.
[00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:45.451]  Most people were shaking my hand.
[00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:46.511]  She said, shame on you.
[00:23:46.531 --> 00:23:47.191]  And I said, what?
[00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:50.112]  She goes, silver?
[00:23:50.232 --> 00:23:52.792]  People are going to turn blue like Papa Smurf.
[00:23:53.933 --> 00:24:04.955]  And I went, the guy that did that, did whole silver bars at thousands of times what has been approved for hospitals and stuff, he wanted to turn blue.
[00:24:04.995 --> 00:24:05.835]  He makes money off of it.
[00:24:05.855 --> 00:24:06.915]  She goes, actually, I know that.
[00:24:08.223 --> 00:24:11.265]  She was like, actually, I know Silver, actually, I've read the stuff, and I still just don't like you.
[00:24:12.386 --> 00:24:13.447]  I go, okay, well, whatever.
[00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.872]  So that's how crazy all of this is.
[00:24:20.372 --> 00:24:28.559]  That's how, okay, let me get back into the big breaking news, because we have... Let me just settle down, because I'm ranting.
[00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:39.934]  You have governments saying we want 1984, total loss of liberty, and it's all the communist Chinese, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel, who's in big trouble, and Macron.
[00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:44.677]  Whether you love those guys or hate them, they're all in trouble, and they're the ones bringing out absolute martial law.
[00:24:45.257 --> 00:24:51.621]  And it's Democrats and globalists everywhere that are power grabbing, and Gavin Newsom looks like he's having an orgasm now he's on TV about the power grab.
[00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:53.882]  And so does Cuomo and all these other unpopular people.
[00:24:58.504 --> 00:25:11.096]   And then you've got The good news, and I'll go over after we take some calls, a Oxford University report on documented antiviral effects of zinc in the human body and all the studies we reposted with links.
[00:25:11.136 --> 00:25:12.618]  You can go read it for yourself!
[00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:19.581]  How it goes into the cell and then the viruses can't manufacture using the mitochondrial DNA.
[00:25:19.941 --> 00:25:23.123]  The virus takes over the cell, replicates itself, and it coats the cell.
[00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:28.886]  And when they come up against it, it says it has an electrical charge that fries it, that disables it.
[00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:34.409]  And they even have electron microscope photos and graphs showing them, burning them up.
[00:25:35.307 --> 00:25:36.168]  Like Star Trek!
[00:25:36.428 --> 00:25:38.869]  The Enterprise pulls up and shoots the Klingons and they blow up!
[00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:50.337]  There's actual electron microscope photos in sync showing them where it pulls up against it and it's bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye!
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.501]  But it doesn't work if it's not already in you.
[00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.463]  And that's what the studies say as well.
[00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:06.311]  So it doesn't treat or cure, because again, if you've been choked to death, you didn't have the oxygen before, you're dead now.
[00:26:07.492 --> 00:26:09.213]  Gotta have the oxygen before.
[00:26:10.614 --> 00:26:14.016]  I can't prevent or treat you if you're already been dead an hour.
[00:26:14.737 --> 00:26:16.338]  I can't put you on a ventilator and bring you back.
[00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:22.682]  And these scum in the media and the corporations, they all know that.
[00:26:24.163 --> 00:26:25.844]  And they won't tell you.
[00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:30.067]  But more and more self-preservation's coming out.
[00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:47.222]  Because I noticed all over the country, local news has medical doctors, virologists, some of them quite famous, on saying, well actually, and then going over it, get some sunlight, drink clean water, get a lot of zinc, get a lot of vitamin D, nanosilver.
[00:26:47.562 --> 00:26:49.483]  And what are you, a doctor?
[00:26:49.543 --> 00:26:50.783]  Yeah, they're doctors, folks.
[00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:53.365]  And all I'm doing is quoting what they said.
[00:26:54.241 --> 00:27:02.929]  But the system doesn't want the people to know because they want you to be scared and locked up in your house and just absolutely in there in a catatonic state.
[00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:04.991]  Okay, let me hit the other stuff and I'm gonna go to your calls.
[00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:07.814]  The toll-free number on this live Saturday Global Transmission.
[00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:11.262]  On the TV, radio, satellites, it's going on everything right now.

[00:27:23.163 --> 00:27:24.163]  Please let us know.
[00:27:24.163 --> 00:27:25.163]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:26.163]  International line.
[00:27:26.163 --> 00:27:27.163]  Dial the country code 512-646-1776.
[00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:28.163]  Okay.
[00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:29.163]  Let me settle down now and hit all the other news here.
[00:27:29.163 --> 00:27:30.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:30.163 --> 00:27:31.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:31.163 --> 00:27:32.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:32.163 --> 00:27:33.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:33.163 --> 00:27:34.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:34.163 --> 00:27:35.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:35.163 --> 00:27:36.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:36.163 --> 00:27:37.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:37.163 --> 00:27:38.163]  I'm ahead of your calls and then Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:38.163 --> 00:27:41.522]  of them. Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:27:41.224 --> 00:27:45.425]  We're going to cover a mystery at the end of the next hour.
[00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:48.606]  Now, I was sent this this morning.
[00:27:49.346 --> 00:27:51.087]  Again, I've been doing research since 2 a.m.
[00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:54.407]  People ask how I have so much energy.
[00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:56.208]  I'm on three cups of coffee.
[00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:57.488]  I don't.
[00:28:00.615 --> 00:28:04.377]  Need to be like the average zombie out there who doesn't have any initiative.
[00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:05.938]  I have an initiative, so I have a lot of energy.
[00:28:06.639 --> 00:28:08.139]  And this is a very, very critical time.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:15.144]  And I'm very, very excited about being able to try to head this off and really educate people and bring humanity together in the process.
[00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:21.607]  I think, as the Bible says, no weapon formed against us shall prosper, and that the pit that your enemy digs for you, he will fall into.
[00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:24.289]  I think that we've seen that in the last few years happen.
[00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:27.231]  I know that we've seen it happen, and I believe and hope and pray it'll happen again.
[00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:37.599]   And I pray to God For justice and for a revival in this country and for a great awakening for people who've fallen away to come back to God and that's what's going to heal our land and give us discernment again.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.223]  Because those that serve evil are blinded, they're given over to great delusion.
[00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:47.250]  Because it's God's spirit of knowledge that flows through us.
[00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.410]  It's not us that has discernment in those things.
[00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:55.211]  It's when we're coupled, electrically, spiritually, in the space-time continuum, jacked into God.
[00:28:55.632 --> 00:28:58.392]  Like a lightbulb doesn't have electricity in it, it's dark.
[00:28:58.952 --> 00:29:01.573]  When God is plugged into it, it's bright.
[00:29:02.813 --> 00:29:05.814]  That's not us, that's God flowing through us!
[00:29:06.914 --> 00:29:07.814]  You can feel it, can't you?
[00:29:07.834 --> 00:29:08.835]  Of course you can!
[00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:10.315]  Now...
[00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:14.390]  Just reach out to God and say, please, I love you.
[00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:14.970]  I want to be good.
[00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.791]  Flow through me.
[00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:19.873]  And the more you do that, and the more you stand up to evil, the more God will flow through you.
[00:29:20.853 --> 00:29:26.936]  And the more you'll feel like a dirty rag, but still empowered because you're close to God, but the more you will not be an arrogant person anymore.
[00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:28.096]  You will be empowered.
[00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:29.797]  They'll think you're arrogant, but you won't be arrogant.
[00:29:29.817 --> 00:29:31.398]  You will be empowered.
[00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:41.909]  By the way, all the studies show people that love God, people that are Christian in particular, but people that meditate are people who want to help others.
[00:29:42.209 --> 00:29:44.511]  They live longer, they're healthier, they don't get sick as much.
[00:29:46.853 --> 00:29:49.375]  Because it's a spirit and the cells resonate with it.
[00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:51.878]  Sorry, that's not FDA approved.
[00:29:52.058 --> 00:29:53.479]  As a Christian, I believe in God.
[00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:54.460]  It empowers me.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.741]  The studies show it.
[00:29:56.882 --> 00:30:03.088]   That the deeply religious of the classic Christian faith Live longer, and are healthier, and don't get us sick.
[00:30:04.548 --> 00:30:04.848]  Okay.
[00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.430]  Let me hit the rest of the news here.
[00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.531]  This is the mystery that we're going to talk about next hour.
[00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:16.232]  I'm going to send a video this morning.
[00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:18.403]  By the main producer, Daria.
[00:30:18.703 --> 00:30:19.543]  She said, have you seen this?
[00:30:19.623 --> 00:30:20.444]  I said, no, I haven't seen it.
[00:30:21.244 --> 00:30:31.469]  And it's just a man on his simple YouTube channel saying he went down during the week to see the jam-packed viral testing center in Hawaii that he lives by, and there was no one there.
[00:30:31.489 --> 00:30:39.853]  And then he shows the news saying that it was jam-packed, but you look at the video, there's no one there in the shot.
[00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:45.552]   They just crop it out and show people in hazmat suits Like it's a big hysterical deal.
[00:30:45.892 --> 00:30:48.374]  And I confirm with people I know in Austin, they go to be tested.
[00:30:48.814 --> 00:30:50.135]  One of my crew did, and they wouldn't let them do it.
[00:30:50.155 --> 00:30:50.715]  There was no one there.
[00:30:53.336 --> 00:30:56.338]  Now, I'm not saying that this is a hoax and no one's dying.
[00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:58.459]  There's all sorts of viral stuff out there.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.001]  But you look at the videos in China of two people on the street flopping around.
[00:31:02.322 --> 00:31:03.722]  Totally fake.
[00:31:03.802 --> 00:31:05.704]  Welding people into doors.
[00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:06.504]  The dystopic stuff.
[00:31:06.804 --> 00:31:11.407]  People running through hospitals with stretchers and then stopping for the camera.
[00:31:13.169 --> 00:31:15.932]  Xi Jinping executes you if you film something you're not allowed to.
[00:31:16.173 --> 00:31:17.995]  They were told to go out and hype this up.
[00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:20.478]  It turns out China did overhype the danger of the virus.
[00:31:20.738 --> 00:31:21.479]  That's been in the news.
[00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:25.844]  So there is a lot of examples.
[00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:29.493]  Of this.
[00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:33.594]  That this was a war weapon, a psychological weapon to be used against us.
[00:31:33.754 --> 00:31:35.034]  And this isn't even the best example.
[00:31:35.134 --> 00:31:40.196]  We're live now, but in post we can put some of the shots of like, the man and the woman that both fall down and are both flopping at the same time on the street.
[00:31:40.456 --> 00:31:42.696]  Haunted chemical weapon kids in Syria turn out to be fake.
[00:31:42.716 --> 00:31:44.977]  Because they'll be flopping for a minute and then stop and look.
[00:31:44.997 --> 00:31:48.098]  It's like... Is that good?
[00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:51.098]  So, there's just a lot of this going on.
[00:31:51.438 --> 00:31:52.659]  So why is it going on?
[00:31:52.819 --> 00:31:54.039]  I'm not saying the virus isn't real.
[00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:55.839]  I'm saying what's behind it.
[00:31:55.899 --> 00:31:57.600]  Well, no sooner...
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:16.569]  Had I seen this this morning that Mike Adams sent me this article, overhead shot please, LA County gives up on containing coronavirus, tells doctors to skip testing of some patients.
[00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:20.771]  That's what we've been told, everybody's calling in about it for weeks.
[00:32:22.312 --> 00:32:26.496]   Well, it's not that they're giving up, something else Is going on.
[00:32:26.556 --> 00:32:30.837]  It turns out the Jason Jones individuals has a hobby, has a YouTube channel.
[00:32:30.857 --> 00:32:33.278]  He's a really smart, major filmmaker.
[00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.098]  I mean, I even have seen some of these films.
[00:32:35.118 --> 00:32:37.999]  He's won NAACP Image Award.
[00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:42.040]  He won the People's Choice Award.
[00:32:43.481 --> 00:32:45.241]  He's, I mean, I'm not going to list all the films he's made.
[00:32:45.281 --> 00:32:46.321]  He's a big filmmaker.
[00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:47.882]  He's a smart guy.
[00:32:49.642 --> 00:32:51.643]  He was there and shot all this and then compares it.
[00:32:51.683 --> 00:32:52.903]  He's joining us into the next hour.
[00:32:54.229 --> 00:33:01.631]  And we're going to look at this because why would the CDC ship people in with coronavirus by the thousands knowingly and then dump them out?
[00:33:01.891 --> 00:33:03.371]  Remember that in San Antonio and other areas?
[00:33:03.931 --> 00:33:06.712]  Unless they know something we don't know.
[00:33:06.752 --> 00:33:10.492]  I mean, I don't know what the answer is, but it isn't computing.
[00:33:10.992 --> 00:33:17.234]  It's like if you put something in your gas tank and your car seized up and black smoke came out, you'd go, you know, that didn't smell or look like gasoline.
[00:33:17.314 --> 00:33:18.154]  What was that?
[00:33:18.294 --> 00:33:18.774]  You don't know.
[00:33:18.814 --> 00:33:19.634]  Is it saltwater?
[00:33:19.694 --> 00:33:20.294]  Is it piss?
[00:33:20.954 --> 00:33:21.615]  Is it vinegar?
[00:33:22.615 --> 00:33:24.615]  Is it lemonade?
[00:33:24.615 --> 00:33:30.615]  It's not gasoline.
[00:33:30.186 --> 00:33:31.668]  Something's going on here.
[00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:36.512]  And I hate to even bring up all the fake stuff in China without telling the crew, because there's so much of it.
[00:33:36.532 --> 00:33:43.979]  But in post, this is live now, we're going to archive it later, maybe we should put an addendum video, just of all the anomalies in China.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.303]  People just lay down and then go, uh, to the camera.
[00:33:48.743 --> 00:33:52.647]  And then the person's so dumb uploading it, they don't even cut off the first part that's fake.
[00:33:53.007 --> 00:33:54.008]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.848]  And people running into hospitals with stretchers.
[00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:59.770]  Find some of those for next hour if you can.
[00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:04.292]  Like, running in real scared, and then they stop and you see the camera crews and they're all high-fiving and stuff.
[00:34:04.913 --> 00:34:06.934]  I mean, this looks like a Hollywood production.
[00:34:07.354 --> 00:34:08.815]  I'm not saying people aren't dying in Italy.
[00:34:09.156 --> 00:34:10.797]  You know, 400, 500 a day, they say.
[00:34:10.837 --> 00:34:17.121]  I'm not saying, you know, people are dying each hour right now in Italy.
[00:34:19.983 --> 00:34:22.108]  New York, and they've got it up there like it's the end of the world.
[00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:23.331]  And look, we're live.
[00:34:23.431 --> 00:34:25.275]  It's my fault for not getting those videos ready.
[00:34:25.756 --> 00:34:26.839]  I don't want to put any more up.
[00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:31.569]  Because, because I want to put the fake ones up.
[00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.950]  Because I'm not saying people aren't dying.
[00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:37.172]  But there's videos, people lie down, a man and a woman in China and flop.
[00:34:37.572 --> 00:34:39.953]  Remember some of the first ones and people running in with the stretchers.
[00:34:40.053 --> 00:34:41.474]  I don't want any of them until I go to break.
[00:34:41.674 --> 00:34:42.494]  I will come and approve them.
[00:34:42.854 --> 00:34:43.334]  Nobody's bad.
[00:34:43.975 --> 00:34:44.855]  We will play the proper ones.
[00:34:45.355 --> 00:34:46.896]  This is going to send me to the moon.
[00:34:47.296 --> 00:34:50.017]  Just, you know, you guys trying to find them and it's not the ones I know are fake.
[00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:53.399]  Like the minute I saw the Knob Creek machine gun shootout video.
[00:34:54.372 --> 00:34:55.393]  Everybody knows that video.
[00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:56.373]  Every year they do it.
[00:34:57.274 --> 00:35:06.158]  And they said it was Trump letting the Turks blow up a city in Syria.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.000]  A Kurdish city.
[00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:13.762]  Before ABC admitted they faked it, I knew it was fake and so did you.
[00:35:13.822 --> 00:35:15.323]  You just know the fakeness when you see it.
[00:35:17.717 --> 00:35:24.444]  All this is going on, all this is unfolding, all this is happening, and they're saying all our rights are going out the window.
[00:35:26.606 --> 00:35:27.567]  What is the endgame?
[00:35:28.007 --> 00:35:53.057]   Well, we know any regime in trouble, China, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Communists barely got it back into power, they're about to be thrown out, or were, Israel, They're all the ones driving that it's the end of the world and saying incredible things like, we want total authoritarianism, we want total control, we want total martial law.
[00:35:53.397 --> 00:35:57.658]  By the way, do you think I'm joking when I say things like that?
[00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:02.800]  Israel debates, quote, total suspension of individual freedom in Knesset.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.801]  Intel hearing calls for 1984.
[00:36:08.777 --> 00:36:14.101]  That's the type of stuff that's going on here.
[00:36:14.181 --> 00:36:19.764]  So we're going to look at this mystery coming up with the filmmaker that noticed it and has pointed it out very well.
[00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:31.412]  That Robert Barnes coming up and then when the transmission ends I'm going to air a very powerful piece that kind of codifies it all of the stupidity of just the reactions and what's going on.
[00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:36.174]  And from an angle of taking it as very, very real and very, very serious from Paul Watson.
[00:36:36.374 --> 00:36:41.539]  So I think all these views, if they're organic and are citizen-human based, need to be respected and looked at.
[00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:46.343]  So you have a lot of different ideas, a lot of different things going on here, and it's all healthy to question everything.
[00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:52.728]  Robert Barnes texted me a few days ago and he said, you know, I hope you've got a ranch out there and a bunch of stogies and steaks.
[00:36:52.868 --> 00:36:54.190]  Well, my dad does, but I don't.
[00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.871]  And it's too far away.
[00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:56.451]  It's in East Texas.
[00:36:56.532 --> 00:36:57.612]  It's family property.
[00:36:59.154 --> 00:37:00.155]  Land, rich, money, poor.
[00:37:01.724 --> 00:37:02.785]  I should have gotten around to that.
[00:37:03.245 --> 00:37:06.448]  But he said if this continues much longer, we're going to have an economic collapse.
[00:37:06.868 --> 00:37:07.969]  And I really respect Barnes.
[00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:12.033]  He does voracious reading like I do and is really dead on about the economy.
[00:37:12.053 --> 00:37:13.514]  And he was saying that days ago.
[00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:14.395]  I was saying it weeks ago.
[00:37:14.455 --> 00:37:17.298]  But now they're saying that the economy is deteriorating very quickly.
[00:37:17.678 --> 00:37:19.259]  You don't lock stuff down like this.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.801]  It kills certainty.
[00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:22.742]  It kills confidence.
[00:37:22.822 --> 00:37:23.543]  It destroys things.
[00:37:23.563 --> 00:37:26.845]   And if it goes on another month, We're probably in an irrevocable depression.
[00:37:27.105 --> 00:37:30.566]  They've been saying, oh, 18 months, we can handle it a year, not leaving your houses.
[00:37:31.006 --> 00:37:32.266]  Boulder dash.
[00:37:33.006 --> 00:37:40.009]  And the divorce rate's going to go off the chart, just like it has in China and other areas just after a few months of lockdown, which China now had to end.
[00:37:40.869 --> 00:37:47.151]  So they're wanting us to have years more of authoritarian control than China had for just a month or so.
[00:37:49.792 --> 00:37:50.432]  Think about that.
[00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:54.373]  They are power grabbing at every level the best they can.
[00:37:55.452 --> 00:38:01.298]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls before we go to Barnes, and then before I go back to your calls into the special guest.
[00:38:01.698 --> 00:38:03.660]  But let me hit Anthony Fauci for you.
[00:38:05.962 --> 00:38:10.206]  I knew who Anthony Fauci was 20-something years ago, 18 years ago.
[00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.248]  He was running the anthrax response and covering it up.
[00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:16.051]  A bureaucrat at the CDC and National Institutes of Health.
[00:38:16.071 --> 00:38:19.074]  I knew he was a big darling of Hillary and Bush Sr.
[00:38:19.094 --> 00:38:19.695]  and the globalists.
[00:38:22.096 --> 00:38:25.437]  But Trump, you know, draws from the experts that are there.
[00:38:25.457 --> 00:38:28.778]  There's millions of people under him.
[00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:31.559]  And he doesn't know where to draw from.
[00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:32.799]  They lie to his face.
[00:38:33.379 --> 00:38:56.728]   But when he gives these press conferences and Fauci sits there and frowns when he talks or then goes up and makes faces and then contradicts the president and gives the worst case globalist fear-mongering scenario every single time, I started looking more into Fauci, and so did others.
[00:38:56.928 --> 00:39:00.010]  Well, here's an article of the Conservative Freehouse, and it's confirmed from the WikiLeaks.
[00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.971]  Fauci's love letter to Hillary Clinton surfaces.
[00:39:02.991 --> 00:39:09.073]  It says, I knew there was something sketchy about Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[00:39:09.773 --> 00:39:17.516]  Within the WikiLeaks HRC email files, there's a letter from Fauci to Hillary Clinton through her lawyer, Cheryl Mills.
[00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:21.998]  Please tell her that we love her, and we are very proud to know her.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:30.686]  He goes on to say she did a great job at Benghazi, and that she just devastated the people in the hearings.
[00:39:31.226 --> 00:39:32.547]  What difference does it make, huh?
[00:39:33.088 --> 00:39:34.069]  I came, I saw, he died.
[00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:47.320]  So, that's Fauci, and Trump doesn't want to change horses in the middle of the stream, because then Fauci will go talk crap about him all over TV, we know that, but Fauci is going to continue doing this, so he needs to be sidelined.
[00:39:49.049 --> 00:39:53.522]  And somebody needs to remind him about the Anthrax cover-up and other things he's been involved in.
[00:39:55.871 --> 00:40:03.336]  And Trump needs to get somebody that knows what they're doing, because this guy was involved in the weaponization of viruses, involved with Obama and Hillary, transferring viruses to China.
[00:40:03.616 --> 00:40:07.499]  They're the ones running all these Level 4 bioweapons labs where they produce these viruses.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.542]  And in three cases, China admits they released deadly viruses that became pandemics there.
[00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:21.208]  And we got bird flu, swine flu, SARS, and now the Wuhan Chinese coronavirus, that we're not supposed to say that.
[00:40:21.228 --> 00:40:25.631]  You know, the Spanish flu is called Spanish flu because the first cases were there, mass death.
[00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:31.616]  The Black Plague is called Black Plague because it puts big black pustules on you.
[00:40:31.856 --> 00:40:33.737]  You know, people just give names from where it came.
[00:40:34.418 --> 00:40:37.720]  Kind of like if a street goes up a big green hill, it says Green Hill.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.643]  They got some white hills in England that are called White Hills, and so they're now changed the name.
[00:40:43.663 --> 00:40:44.624]  The word white's evil.
[00:40:45.024 --> 00:40:48.546]  I mean, it's all just an attack on knowledge and information.
[00:40:49.087 --> 00:40:50.848]  It's the Chinese coronavirus.
[00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:56.051]  Because if we don't say it's that, the media is saying it's Trump's fault.
[00:40:58.385 --> 00:41:11.109]  So let's play this clip of Anthony Fauci facepalming RadioLosers.InfoWars.com when Trump's talking about the Deep State Department.
[00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:12.149]  And by the way, I study government.
[00:41:12.689 --> 00:41:16.130]  The State Department runs the CIA.
[00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.971]  It's really the Office of National Intelligence.
[00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:24.314]  And it's involved through the presidency, coordinating for the president all the agencies.
[00:41:24.414 --> 00:41:26.175]  And so it's become its own rogue agency.
[00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:36.382]  And that's where they have the state-of-the-mind networks and the billions of bucks Obama gave them, the Defense Authorization Act in 2007, right when he left office, weeks before Trump left.
[00:41:37.082 --> 00:41:38.203]  They signed the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:41:38.223 --> 00:41:41.646]   It was actually in December of 2016, but it got funded the next year.
[00:41:42.287 --> 00:41:45.467]  Two years of funding to go after the press using the CIA.
[00:41:45.727 --> 00:41:46.748]  That's all out of the State Department.
[00:41:47.108 --> 00:41:48.368]  It's all run out of there.
[00:41:48.788 --> 00:41:51.669]  And the Soros moles are deep in there, and Trump's getting rid of them.
[00:41:52.529 --> 00:41:57.510]  But the media said right in front of his own Secretary of State Pompeo, he attacked the agency.
[00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.070]  Well, the head of it's not the rest of the people in there.
[00:42:01.031 --> 00:42:03.031]  It is the Department of Deep State.
[00:42:03.371 --> 00:42:04.892]  But that's only one level.
[00:42:05.332 --> 00:42:10.981]   Fauci, if you're a radio listener, Smiles, grabs his face, then looks really upset and angry.
[00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:13.122]  Because he loves it.
[00:42:13.162 --> 00:42:13.942]  He loves Hillary.
[00:42:14.262 --> 00:42:15.263]  He's a creature of it.
[00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:18.664]  And when Hillary was Secretary of State, she was co-president.
[00:42:19.224 --> 00:42:21.005]  Obama let her run foreign affairs.
[00:42:21.865 --> 00:42:22.905]  That was the deal with the Clintons.
[00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:24.526]  And her foundation is still billions.
[00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:25.646]  Billions.
[00:42:26.186 --> 00:42:26.687]  Three billion.
[00:42:27.287 --> 00:42:30.488]  So here is what happened with Trump and Fauci yesterday.
[00:42:32.264 --> 00:42:33.044]  What a little weasel.
[00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:36.242]   So if you have any question for him right now, could you do that?
[00:42:36.242 --> 00:42:39.244]   Because you know what I'd like to do? I'd like him to go back to
[00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:41.402]   the State Department, or as they call it,
[00:42:41.402 --> 00:42:42.844]  the Deep State Department.
[00:42:42.844 --> 00:42:44.043]  You don't mind?
[00:42:44.043 --> 00:42:46.402]   I'd like to have him go back and do his job.
[00:42:46.402 --> 00:42:48.222]  So does anybody have any question?
[00:42:48.222 --> 00:42:54.923]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:42:54.923 --> 00:42:58.483]  What a little weasel.
[00:42:58.483 --> 00:43:01.123]   It's like they never got out of high school or junior high.
[00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:04.123]  Let this walk up to me and go, "Shame on you!"
[00:43:04.094 --> 00:43:04.995]  You're embarrassing!
[00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:05.735]  You're a failure!
[00:43:05.775 --> 00:43:06.556]  You're a bad man!
[00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:11.438]  And it has no effect on me and I don't know what to do because I have my own internal integrity.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.482]  But with these leftists and in government, it's all about kissing each other's ass.
[00:43:17.782 --> 00:43:18.663]  They're all shallow.
[00:43:18.723 --> 00:43:19.483]  They're all fake.
[00:43:19.783 --> 00:43:22.084]  They all glad hand each other and they all feed on us.
[00:43:22.425 --> 00:43:24.306]  And they can't stand Trump.
[00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.787]  Notice Pompeo laughs and smiles.
[00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:29.689]  Not saying he's perfect, but he knows what Trump's talking about.
[00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:33.050]  The Department of Deep State.
[00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.532]  How many times have I said the State Department's the big enchilada?
[00:43:36.152 --> 00:43:36.852]  It's the Deep State.
[00:43:37.233 --> 00:43:37.893]  It's the problem.
[00:43:38.273 --> 00:43:38.954]  It runs the show.
[00:43:40.355 --> 00:43:41.816]  You know who commands all the agencies?
[00:43:41.856 --> 00:43:44.298]  Who commands all the... The State Department.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.102]  It's the will of the President and the executive branch all over the world.
[00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:53.264]  And while the cats away, the mice play.
[00:43:53.524 --> 00:43:55.285]  The President doesn't know what's going on in those places.
[00:43:55.305 --> 00:43:57.427]  I don't know what's going on in the building across the street.
[00:43:58.368 --> 00:44:00.249]  In our complex of offices.
[00:44:01.647 --> 00:44:03.248]  I don't know what's going on in the bathroom over there.
[00:44:04.588 --> 00:44:08.370]  You just gotta have your directive and try to get people in there that'll follow it and do the best job they can.
[00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:10.852]  Instead, they've used complexity to rob everybody.
[00:44:11.132 --> 00:44:11.432]  Alright.
[00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:13.605]  Thomas is in Spain.
[00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:14.726]  Collar is in lockdown.
[00:44:14.746 --> 00:44:15.686]  Things are getting crazy.
[00:44:15.706 --> 00:44:17.107]  We've got to pull up the drone footage in Spain.
[00:44:17.727 --> 00:44:19.667]  Joe is natural supplements that are beneficial.
[00:44:19.687 --> 00:44:20.288]  Let's talk about that.
[00:44:20.328 --> 00:44:20.788]  New Jersey.
[00:44:21.088 --> 00:44:21.828]  Peter Washington.
[00:44:21.848 --> 00:44:23.169]  Trump will be blamed.
[00:44:23.189 --> 00:44:24.669]  The virus, the economy in America.
[00:44:25.409 --> 00:44:27.210]  Samuel in Georgia works FedEx.
[00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.050]  Marshall Law coming.
[00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.731]  Travel restrictions.
[00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:30.091]  Victors in Europe.
[00:44:30.791 --> 00:44:31.912]  Pension funds, economy.
[00:44:32.012 --> 00:44:33.092]  Dawson's in California.
[00:44:33.152 --> 00:44:34.573]  Gun store closures in California.
[00:44:34.593 --> 00:44:34.773]  Yep.
[00:44:35.293 --> 00:44:36.073]  Nixon, Michigan.
[00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:37.654]  Coronavirus 9-11 Part 2.
[00:44:38.094 --> 00:44:38.994]  Steve's in Nebraska.
[00:44:39.534 --> 00:44:40.075]  New World Order.
[00:44:40.115 --> 00:44:40.355]  Trump.
[00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:48.498]  China Connections, Brad in PA, climate change scam on a global level, and Jim, President Trump supporting social distancing.
[00:44:48.879 --> 00:45:00.084]  Well, we're not sure how bad the virus really is, and if Trump doesn't act like he's for all this, he's been fighting as much as he can, then they'll say every death's his fault, so it's a balancing act.
[00:45:00.704 --> 00:45:09.268]  First he came out, you know, a month ago and said, bad things happen, we've always had this, it's sad, you know, try to take things to boost your immunity, we'll try to get a cure, whatever.
[00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:13.450]  But now it's okay.
[00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:19.333]  Like we gotta turn the schools into prisons and have school guards and everything else and let the kids that threaten to kill people stay there.
[00:45:21.094 --> 00:45:22.775]  Put them on drugs that make people kill people.
[00:45:24.795 --> 00:45:25.275]  See how it works?
[00:45:26.116 --> 00:45:34.339]  And so, if we spend hundreds of millions of dollars the last 20 years to turn the schools into prisons to stop 30 or 40 mass shootings, well, what's gonna happen if hundreds of thousands die?
[00:45:34.799 --> 00:45:40.962]  Everybody's got their phone, there's viral trackers, everybody's getting blood tests every day, drones are watching us, because, aah, a virus!
[00:45:41.803 --> 00:45:43.663]  Because we totally panicked.
[00:45:44.504 --> 00:45:46.565]  This is the new authoritarianism, this is the takeover.
[00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:49.806]  So, let's go ahead and play clip six.
[00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:51.987]  Get ready for forced quarantines.
[00:45:52.787 --> 00:45:53.488]  Our next, here it is.
[00:45:54.565 --> 00:45:55.486]  As major U.S.
[00:45:55.546 --> 00:46:07.472]  cities prepare for a total lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, police, state troopers, and the Army and Air National Guard are preparing for martial law.
[00:46:07.792 --> 00:46:11.934]  And that means you need to prepare for mass quarantines.
[00:46:13.175 --> 00:46:17.778]  So what is martial law going to look like and how long will the quarantines last?
[00:46:18.119 --> 00:46:30.127]  Well right now nobody really has the answer to those questions but what we can do is look at what's already happened and what is occurring right now in other countries who are fighting to contain the virus.
[00:46:30.507 --> 00:46:37.932]  And what we do know for sure is that once the lockdowns begin, expect them to quickly spread across the country.
[00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:43.396]  For example, it was only a month ago when everything seemed perfectly normal in Italy.
[00:46:43.736 --> 00:46:50.460]  People filled the cafes and restaurants as usual, tourism was normal, and businesses were thriving.
[00:46:50.781 --> 00:47:00.247]  But now, just four weeks later, the streets are almost completely empty amid a nationwide lockdown imposed by the Italian government.
[00:47:01.188 --> 00:47:05.330]  Italy unable to wake up from its nightmare.
[00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.112]  475 more deaths in 24 hours.
[00:47:07.372 --> 00:47:10.214]  The deadliest day in the coronavirus outbreak anywhere.
[00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:17.859]  It was a gut punch to see that video today out of Bergamo with the army having to come in and move the bodies because they're just piling up.
[00:47:18.559 --> 00:47:22.502]  Italy's coronavirus death toll has surged past 9,000 lives.
[00:47:22.522 --> 00:47:24.203]  820 people have died in the last 48 hours.
[00:47:28.706 --> 00:47:35.350]  Their health care system has reached the breaking point and police are now patrolling the streets with drones.
[00:47:40.333 --> 00:47:46.397]  Harsh prison sentences have been proposed for anyone who breaks the coronavirus isolation.
[00:47:47.057 --> 00:47:51.600]  So all you have to do to predict when massive quarantines might hit the U.S.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:48:03.288]   is look at the timelines in other countries and you'll see that massive Massive lockdowns are occurring on about 21 to 23 days after the first community spread of the virus.
[00:48:03.528 --> 00:48:10.894]  And that means America could start seeing major lockdowns and quarantines as soon as this weekend.
[00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:19.102]  Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is already calling for military intervention to combat the outbreak.
[00:48:19.462 --> 00:48:29.293]  And globalists like Bill Gates are now pushing for COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor the masses.
[00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:37.267]  Bill Gates and MIT developed a new tattoo ID to check for vaccinations.
[00:48:37.787 --> 00:48:38.828]  They do a test.
[00:48:38.928 --> 00:48:43.152]  If you are negative for COVID-19, you get that little wristband for one day.
[00:48:43.172 --> 00:48:45.014]  You have to do it again the next day.
[00:48:45.154 --> 00:48:48.977]  If you want to travel, if you want to go to work, you want to go to school, you're going to have to get that permission from the government.
[00:48:49.057 --> 00:48:53.021]  It's actually a nanotech chip sewn into your flesh.
[00:48:53.601 --> 00:48:56.484]  So you talk about Mark of the Beastman, this is it.
[00:48:56.784 --> 00:49:02.670]  Now, Denmark has already passed a law enabling forced coronavirus vaccinations.
[00:49:03.511 --> 00:49:14.483]  Citizens who refuse to be tested will face fines, prison time, and will be prevented from entering shops, grocery stores, public transports, and hospitals.
[00:49:14.943 --> 00:49:22.689]   Most cities within the United States have already begun emergency measures To limit public gatherings to 10 people or less.
[00:49:22.889 --> 00:49:32.593]  And it is now a crime in most places, punishable by hefty fines, imprisonment, or both, if you dare defy the public order.
[00:49:32.613 --> 00:49:36.275]  The San Francisco Bay Area on lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:49:36.315 --> 00:49:43.077]  They're calling it shelter in place and they're ordering all residents to remain in their place of residency starting midnight tonight.
[00:49:43.818 --> 00:49:48.700]  Everything we ever warned you about, exactly as we warned you about it, is now happening.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:50:01.564]  By the way, speak of the devil, that report was from Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:50:01.584 --> 00:50:03.425]  He started editing it Tuesday, put it out Wednesday.
[00:50:06.146 --> 00:50:09.128]  And notice the day after it came out on Thursday.
[00:50:11.704 --> 00:50:14.326]  That was 21 days after the first communicable case.
[00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:17.929]  There's really a global UN system running this.
[00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:21.332]  Just like all the other countries, that's when they started locking the cities down.
[00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:28.137]  And they're really pushing Trump to bring in martial law completely and really kill the economy, or it's his fault every death.
[00:50:29.018 --> 00:50:30.519]  And now we'll go to Thomas in Spain.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.000]  Caller is in lockdown.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.722]  He says things are getting crazy there locally.
[00:50:34.522 --> 00:50:35.643]  What are you witnessing, Thomas?
[00:50:35.683 --> 00:50:36.244]  Thanks for calling.
[00:50:37.529 --> 00:50:38.630]  Hi, Alex.
[00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.010]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.291]  I'm first time caller.
[00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:42.491]  Yes, sitting in Spain.
[00:50:43.372 --> 00:50:44.432]  I'm actually German.
[00:50:44.452 --> 00:50:45.532]  My wife's Australian.
[00:50:45.733 --> 00:50:50.334]  And we were in Spain to sell our property and then move back to Australia.
[00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:58.778]  And now for a week, since last Sunday, actually, we are certainly sitting in total lockdown and everything is shut.
[00:50:58.898 --> 00:50:59.819]  Everything is closed.
[00:51:00.259 --> 00:51:06.449]   Just down Wanted to go to a hardware store to get some wood for the fireplace, because it's still quite cold here.
[00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:09.170]  And then I got stopped by a police car.
[00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.431]  And what I'm doing here is, yeah, I want to go shopping.
[00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:14.452]  And yeah, nothing is open, only food.
[00:51:16.432 --> 00:51:18.673]  Yeah, that's all we can get, all we can do here.
[00:51:18.693 --> 00:51:20.753]  We're not allowed to go out of the house.
[00:51:21.514 --> 00:51:25.115]  We have rules set up, how we have to behave, what we have to do.
[00:51:25.195 --> 00:51:30.116]  And if we don't follow the rules, we get fined by a thousand euros or even prison.
[00:51:30.895 --> 00:51:35.459]  And yeah, shopping wise we can only go one person at a time.
[00:51:35.499 --> 00:51:38.742]  We are not allowed to have two people in the car, only one person.
[00:51:39.603 --> 00:51:41.605]  And it's really crazy.
[00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:49.552]  Well notice it's all standardized that drones hover above you in Spain and in France and now in the U.S.
[00:51:49.592 --> 00:51:52.194]  it's starting and in China it all started there.
[00:51:52.575 --> 00:51:54.776]  Drones flying around shouting orders at you.
[00:51:55.057 --> 00:51:57.319]  So we're learning about our new little robot controllers.
[00:52:00.538 --> 00:52:03.380]  I don't know what I should think about all this virus thing anymore.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:08.003]  I mean, I was spending on the internet myself doing a bit of due diligence about viruses.
[00:52:08.184 --> 00:52:09.885]  I'm an ex-airline pilot.
[00:52:09.905 --> 00:52:15.129]  I was flying when we had SARS, and I looked up on the internet, and they're not hiding anything.
[00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:21.748]   You can look up everything on Wikipedia about previous deadly disease like SARS, which had
[00:52:21.748 --> 00:52:25.668]  a death rate or fatality rate of 11%.
[00:52:25.668 --> 00:52:32.068]  And Ebola, which was in 2014, had 83 to 90% fatality rate.
[00:52:32.608 --> 00:52:35.709]  I think there's, well, first of all, I really think it's the globalist takeover that's definite.
[00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:38.088]  And so things much more deadly, it didn't happen.
[00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:42.268]   Why do you think it's happening now with something that maybe is 1% of old people?
[00:52:42.268 --> 00:52:45.648]  Well, that's really the thing.
[00:52:45.648 --> 00:52:51.088]   I think there's, well, first of all, I really think it's the globalist takeover.
[00:52:51.088 --> 00:52:56.009]   That's a definite, I mean, now in Europe, the news come out that Christine Lagarde
[00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:57.969]  wants to ban cash in Europe.
[00:52:57.969 --> 00:53:03.407]   That's a definite because the cash can spread this deadly virus and cars cannot.
[00:53:03.595 --> 00:53:05.977]  And for folks who don't know, that's the head of the IMF.
[00:53:06.878 --> 00:53:09.440]  So the top bankers are wanting to ban cash.
[00:53:10.561 --> 00:53:12.402]  Yes, they want to ban cash here.
[00:53:13.263 --> 00:53:14.324]  And that's the reason.
[00:53:14.384 --> 00:53:17.126]  I mean, we have pretty much cash limit here anyway.
[00:53:17.226 --> 00:53:22.044]   In Spain, you can't purchase anything more than 2,500 euros in cash.
[00:53:22.545 --> 00:53:25.645]  And again, they can control everything you do once they get rid of the cash.
[00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:27.846]  They are closing the noose around our necks.
[00:53:27.866 --> 00:53:29.446]  You're a really smart caller, Thomas.
[00:53:29.486 --> 00:53:30.446]  What do you think we should do?
[00:53:31.867 --> 00:53:36.127]  Well, if I just knew, Alex, we are pretty much stuck here.
[00:53:36.248 --> 00:53:37.928]  We cannot sell our property now.
[00:53:38.188 --> 00:53:39.928]  Everything is on hold.
[00:53:40.028 --> 00:53:44.129]  No real estate agent would do any viewings or whatsoever.
[00:53:44.269 --> 00:53:51.111]   So we can't even go to Australia because We don't even have any more flights here out of this country.
[00:53:52.451 --> 00:54:00.916]  Lufthansa, the German airline, they are now down, they cut down to 90% of their flights, and they're talking about the complete halt of the complete flight operation.
[00:54:02.057 --> 00:54:04.238]  The Polish airline, they have already done this.
[00:54:04.538 --> 00:54:05.879]  They totally stopped flying.
[00:54:06.859 --> 00:54:11.742]  But Sweden says if you are a Soros, you in-flight of Muslim men, you are exempt.
[00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:14.382]  Yeah, probably.
[00:54:16.783 --> 00:54:17.764]  You may not have seen it.
[00:54:17.804 --> 00:54:18.885]  That's an article two days ago.
[00:54:19.985 --> 00:54:21.546]  Yeah, I haven't seen that yet.
[00:54:22.127 --> 00:54:23.948]  So yeah, I don't know.
[00:54:24.568 --> 00:54:26.109]  Germany is now becoming the same.
[00:54:26.269 --> 00:54:27.610]  They will have total lockdown.
[00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:31.052]  Everything is happening there and panic shopping all over the place.
[00:54:31.132 --> 00:54:32.233]  No more toilet paper.
[00:54:33.174 --> 00:54:35.095]  No more flour and all sorts of stuff.
[00:54:35.115 --> 00:54:35.735]  No pasta.
[00:54:35.835 --> 00:54:36.816]  I have that for my parents.
[00:54:36.856 --> 00:54:37.856]  They're still living in Germany.
[00:54:38.277 --> 00:54:39.618]  It's absolutely crazy.
[00:54:39.738 --> 00:54:40.318]  Ask my dad.
[00:54:41.164 --> 00:54:50.688]  If he had seen anything like this in his lifetime, and he mentioned to me, not even my grandfather has anything seen like this in a second.
[00:54:50.728 --> 00:54:51.208]  You're right.
[00:54:51.248 --> 00:54:52.588]  This is the great panic.
[00:54:52.668 --> 00:54:57.990]  This is the world coming to its knees from brainwashing and running from the mouse that roared.
[00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:01.732]  A virus that on a scale of 1 to 10 of deadliness is maybe a 2.
[00:55:02.512 --> 00:55:05.233]  And it's just, people never behaved like this in history, sir.
[00:55:05.673 --> 00:55:06.894]  Very powerful call.
[00:55:07.874 --> 00:55:10.098]  I'm going to be doing more of these commercial-free shows.
[00:55:10.218 --> 00:55:12.923]  In fact, things are so insane, we could be locked down at any time, period.
[00:55:12.943 --> 00:55:14.466]  I don't want to commend the crew.
[00:55:14.626 --> 00:55:15.427]  I'm going to be up here.
[00:55:17.062 --> 00:55:19.424]  Probably quite a bit this week after 6 p.m.
[00:55:19.484 --> 00:55:20.324]  with the Skeleton Crew.
[00:55:20.344 --> 00:55:22.065]  I'll do two or three hours every night of phone calls.
[00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.006]  I'm pledging to do it.
[00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:24.607]  I'm absolutely pledging.
[00:55:24.667 --> 00:55:25.547]  I can't sleep anyways.
[00:55:25.587 --> 00:55:28.469]  I just, it's just, this is the maximum insanity.
[00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.811]  Everything we warned of, this is it.
[00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:33.773]  It's either, this is how the globalists are counter-striking.
[00:55:34.113 --> 00:55:35.093]  Thank you so much, Thomas.
[00:55:36.014 --> 00:55:37.115]  Okay, another caller from Europe.
[00:55:37.135 --> 00:55:38.235]  I'm going to get these folks first.
[00:55:39.116 --> 00:55:41.798]  Victor in Europe, if you don't mind, where are you calling from?
[00:55:42.258 --> 00:55:43.719]  Tell us what your take is.
[00:55:44.986 --> 00:55:47.047]  I'm calling from Europe, Central Europe.
[00:55:47.908 --> 00:55:54.391]  Back in 1998, Army personnel tried to recruit me for a DIA, Special Access Program.
[00:55:55.292 --> 00:56:00.995]  And one of the persons in the program told me about how all the pension funds had been stolen.
[00:56:02.156 --> 00:56:08.660]  And their idea was to kill off the oldest people to give them time to refund pension funds.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.223]  And when he told me about this, I looked at him and I said, you realize they're never going to put that money back in.
[00:56:15.446 --> 00:56:17.446]  and then he didn't say anything.
[00:56:17.446 --> 00:56:18.446]  That's the cover story.
[00:56:18.446 --> 00:56:22.446]   In fact, that's what Bill Gates says, and they just test you with a cover story to see
[00:56:22.446 --> 00:56:26.846]   if you're into the eugenics cult, and then if you'll kill old people, you'll kill anybody.
[00:56:26.846 --> 00:56:31.365]   But tell us more about what they tried to recruit you into, because this isn't just
[00:56:31.365 --> 00:56:32.485]  speculation.
[00:56:32.485 --> 00:56:36.485]   This is the cult, and this is Bill Gates saying, "Kill grandma, save the economy."
[00:56:36.487 --> 00:56:44.973]  And they now have stolen all the mortgages, all the pension funds, have been stolen on purpose and then leveraged by the globalists because they can't help it.
[00:56:45.033 --> 00:56:46.874]  It's the very nature of what they do.
[00:56:46.914 --> 00:56:58.403]  Then they hold that giant black hole Ponzi scheme as too big to fail and then the whole world signs on to it as not to lose their pension funds when they already lost them before.
[00:56:58.483 --> 00:56:59.724]  It's called holding people hostage.
[00:56:59.944 --> 00:57:01.045]  Go back and tell us more, Victor.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:15.790]  Well, one of the reasons why I didn't join, or that is that they didn't want me, is a different person who was interviewing me, he asked me what my political beliefs were.
[00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:16.951]  And I said, I don't know.
[00:57:17.031 --> 00:57:19.413]  And he said, well, just tell me.
[00:57:19.613 --> 00:57:22.115]  And I said, well, what are your beliefs?
[00:57:22.315 --> 00:57:26.799]  And he told me that he's to the right of Genghis Khan, and his son is to the right of him.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:45.266]   And that's the kind of people, they're really looking for people who are And that's until they replace them with robots.
[00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:47.408]  Yeah.
[00:57:47.509 --> 00:57:48.550]  That's why they want robots.
[00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:53.816]  They will follow the orders, be given their program, and then autonomously go out and seek and destroy.
[00:57:55.523 --> 00:57:57.325]  Let me mention... Hold on, you've got time.
[00:57:57.666 --> 00:58:02.111]  Go back to what year it was again, why they were trying to recruit you, because that's fascinating.
[00:58:02.131 --> 00:58:04.214]  Because really, they're not really recruiting you for that.
[00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:09.881]  It's a lifeboat test to see your worldview.
[00:58:10.161 --> 00:58:10.522]  Go ahead.
[00:58:12.184 --> 00:58:13.686]  Are you familiar with remote dealing?
[00:58:15.953 --> 00:58:17.833]  I mean, I know the government does a lot of studies into that.
[00:58:17.853 --> 00:58:19.294]  I know the Pentagon's done studies into it.
[00:58:19.774 --> 00:58:23.054]  Most people can't control stuff like that, but it does, it does exist.
[00:58:23.434 --> 00:58:24.214]  It does work.
[00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:43.458]  They officially, CIA officially, if you, if you go on Vimeo and you can look up ABC News Nightline with Ted Koppel, 1995, and the CIA came on the program and admitted they've spent 20 years and $20 million on the program, but it didn't work.
[00:58:44.138 --> 00:58:45.338]  But in fact, it does work.
[00:58:46.337 --> 00:58:59.564]  And the reason why the program got exposed was there was a guy by the name of David Morehouse, who was in the program, and they were trying to get him and other people to use their skills for killing other people.
[00:59:00.144 --> 00:59:04.626]  And a lot of the people that they killed... Sure, sure, that's the men who stare at goats, at which they did a whitewash with that.
[00:59:05.126 --> 00:59:07.488]  And the operative they had write the whitewash is John Ronson.
[00:59:07.508 --> 00:59:08.568]  He's a super bad dude.
[00:59:10.409 --> 00:59:11.530]  But it really does work.
[00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.371]  I used to do it myself.
[00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:20.044]  Let me go on and mention to you one other thing regarding economics.
[00:59:21.265 --> 00:59:29.891]  I briefly knew a woman who is one of the top international lawyers in the world, and she deals with the wealthiest, I mean, the 1% of 1%.
[00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:43.080]  And her assignment was to make sure that when the economy crashes, that the FDIC doesn't pay out the $100,000 policy to the people who have their money in the bank.
[00:59:44.071 --> 00:59:48.455]  And she was actually excited and looking forward to an economic collapse.
[00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:52.878]  Sure, what you're saying is this is the cover for the financial reset.
[00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:55.200]  And I believe that's the overriding reason.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.002]  The globalists don't do something unless it all aligns for their agenda.
[00:59:58.523 --> 01:00:06.009]  Collapse things, have a cover to do it, bring in a technocracy, have people accept being prisoners, being under total surveillance, and kill off a bunch of old people.
[01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:07.770]  That's why I think the virus is real.
[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.311]  Other folks think it's hype.
[01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:10.572]  No, no, no.
[01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:19.777]  It's real, but this is only phase one as a simulant, which is still deadly, but not going to be anything compared to what comes out next.
[01:00:20.337 --> 01:00:24.618]  If we lock ourselves down pliantly and behave, they're going to bring out much more deadly versions.
[01:00:24.658 --> 01:00:25.159]  What do you think?
[01:00:26.419 --> 01:00:27.139]  I agree with you.
[01:00:27.279 --> 01:00:27.659]  I agree.
[01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:32.861]  I think that this version is just mild compared to what's going to occur.
[01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:41.599]   And back in early 1993-94, I used to talk to a woman whose husband was a top scientist
[01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:45.961]  for the US government in the area of bio-warfare.
[01:00:45.961 --> 01:00:52.120]   And she was always telling me things about American-type culture collection and some
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.760]  of these other groups.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.041]   And I mean, she was like 10 years ahead of what other people would find out about.
[01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:02.861]   And one day, I was talking to her on the phone with another woman.
[01:01:02.861 --> 01:01:05.480]  We had a three-way phone conversation.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.001]  And I hear this helicopter outside.
[01:01:09.001 --> 01:01:11.041]  And then it got really loud.
[01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:15.921]   I went out of my porch, and I look up, and there was a black helicopter with kind of
[01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:19.961]  like a gray-green anthracite and no markings on the side.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:25.785]  And on the front, it had what I found out later was a FLIR device, Forward Looking Infrared.
[01:01:26.185 --> 01:01:36.834]  And I talked to her, I called her back, and this other woman, and all three of us had the same black helicopter come over our homes at the exact same time.
[01:01:37.469 --> 01:01:39.572]  So I've been monitored ever since 1993.
[01:01:39.632 --> 01:01:43.037]  Well, you know, it's funny, in the 90s there was a project.
[01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:50.092]  With the UN, with FEMA, and also the military to do drills and stuff, but also have helicopters mess with people.
[01:01:50.112 --> 01:01:50.813]  It was confirmed.
[01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.333]  It came out in Soldier of Fortune.
[01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:55.334]  I mean, I was big into trying to figure out the mystery of it.
[01:01:55.974 --> 01:02:01.455]  And it definitely went on to harass people to get reports going of these helicopters everywhere.
[01:02:01.475 --> 01:02:04.036]  And that's what we call it, black helicopter people.
[01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:05.236]  And of course, all of it's admitted now.
[01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:06.176]  Thank you, Victor.
[01:02:07.116 --> 01:02:09.577]  You know, I don't know about remote viewing.
[01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:20.866]  The brain is so powerful as an electrochemical computer that it's able to take in trillions of different items when your conscious mind can only bring in thousands at a time and integrate them.
[01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:36.473]  And then you take all that information and integrate it, and then you imagine your remote viewing, but when you've already been testing and studying a subject, then you can figure out what they're doing.
[01:02:38.594 --> 01:02:40.275]  And there is a psychic element to it.
[01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:43.390]  But it's more of an interdimensional thing.
[01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:47.033]  And I mean, I know that because I mean, I'm on record.
[01:02:47.093 --> 01:02:49.334]  I'm like one of these guys that tells you that this stuff, the government.
[01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:55.039]  I mean, I mean, everybody knows I've said they're going to both the World Trade Center by middle of the lot in the next few months.
[01:02:55.059 --> 01:02:55.680]  Call the White House.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:01.584]  Everybody knows I said they're going to attack a sports stadium or I said a rock concert or something.
[01:03:01.624 --> 01:03:03.145]  I'd say at 10 o'clock, say tonight.
[01:03:03.526 --> 01:03:04.907]  And then they attack Vegas at 10 o'clock.
[01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:07.749]  I don't just use it randomly.
[01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:17.433]  I mean, it's like, I'm usually on target with what I'm talking about, but all of a sudden I'll just kind of get like a bunch of data and go, and then they're gonna, and it's more like my brain just goes, and all this stuff that happens.
[01:03:17.973 --> 01:03:19.854]  And when I was a kid, I used to have it happen a lot more.
[01:03:19.874 --> 01:03:24.996]  That's why they called a certain people right around puberty and stuff, right around puberty, like 10 to about 12 or so.
[01:03:25.116 --> 01:03:27.237]  I mean, it was just almost every night.
[01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:32.059]  Dreams of just non, it'd be like something that's gonna happen in church in a month.
[01:03:33.072 --> 01:03:44.822]  Or I'm gonna go to the grocery store, or a kid's gonna attack me, or I'm gonna pull my shoulder out of socket, and when I'd wake up, I'd be covered in sweat and like nauseous, like I'd gone into the future.
[01:03:45.183 --> 01:03:53.991]  But what that is, is the brain could like project forward with dimension somehow, in some time loop, they've got mathematical equations, fold space, and was going into the future.
[01:03:55.015 --> 01:04:06.561]  And, uh, so, I mean, that's out there and maybe there's people that can control it, but from what I know, and I know a lot of folks that have actually been involved in those kind of real projects for real, is that that's, it's, it's also genetic.
[01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:08.462]  It runs in bloodlines and things like that.
[01:04:08.622 --> 01:04:10.223]  It's what Star Wars makes all the, you know.
[01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:15.635]   comic book style stuff out of and I don't tell you that stuff to try to act
[01:04:15.635 --> 01:04:21.235]   all avant-garde or shadowy and stuff I tell you this stuff is real so I know
[01:04:21.235 --> 01:04:25.434]   those projects are real I know all about it believe me okay let's go ahead and
[01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:31.316]   and people can't control it in my experience if you could you'd rule the
[01:04:31.316 --> 01:04:38.916]   world let's go ahead and if you can't already have that psychic power
[01:04:36.858 --> 01:04:38.239]  You already got a leg up on most people, don't you?
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.301]  Let's move quickly here because Barnes is about to come on with us.
[01:04:42.002 --> 01:04:42.923]  We don't come back with your calls.
[01:04:42.943 --> 01:04:44.003]  I really appreciate all your calls.
[01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:45.364]  He's a great caller.
[01:04:45.384 --> 01:04:46.205]  So we got to move quicker now.
[01:04:47.386 --> 01:04:48.387]  Samuel in Georgia.
[01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:49.007]  Thanks for holding.
[01:04:49.067 --> 01:04:50.188]  Says you work for FedEx.
[01:04:50.568 --> 01:04:51.129]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:04:51.169 --> 01:04:51.489]  Thank you.
[01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:53.170]  How you doing?
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.292]  Yeah, I do work for FedEx.
[01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:56.653]  I just want to give a quick shout out.
[01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:59.435]  All your products, amazing stuff as well on top of that.
[01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:01.376]  But yes, back to my point.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.723]  So I go into work, FedEx, four o'clock in the morning.
[01:05:04.783 --> 01:05:08.607]  As soon as I walk in through the door, I'm handed a piece of paper.
[01:05:08.627 --> 01:05:11.970]  It is literally, it's just a printout, just a regular printout piece of paper.
[01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:14.112]  It is my authorization to drive.
[01:05:14.793 --> 01:05:15.694]  Now, I live in Georgia.
[01:05:15.714 --> 01:05:19.097]  I just go right across the state line to Tennessee to drive there.
[01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:25.034]   And I have, I do have a feeling, like you have called it, Marshall Law is coming, and it's coming to a state near you.
[01:05:25.114 --> 01:05:26.835]  And very next, it's going to be your state.
[01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:27.595]  So it is.
[01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:29.176]  It's going to happen in Tennessee.
[01:05:29.437 --> 01:05:30.437]  I know this for a fact.
[01:05:31.018 --> 01:05:33.419]  There's other people that I know that work in my section.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.981]  One individual is a significant other.
[01:05:37.262 --> 01:05:40.924]  Her mother is actually the aide to the Georgia of Tennessee.
[01:05:41.244 --> 01:05:46.171]   And another individual I work with, who is, you know, he was past Marines, but he's now working
[01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:50.881]   for TVA and he's managing the crisis center pretty much on his other job as he's
[01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.481]  moonlighting at FedEx.
[01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.641]  Our shifts are only four hours long.
[01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:59.320]   But the stuff that I've learned just working there in the past few months, not only that,
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.280]  it all coincides with what you've been talking about.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.561]   It's amazing, honestly, in my opinion, because, you know, me being born in the '90s, you know,
[01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:13.041]   early '90s, I heard about this stuff, you know, read about it.
[01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:16.761]  I am interested in the whole concept of it's...
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.604]  Honestly, it's mind boggling to really think, but there's bad people out there and they just seek to do bad things.
[01:06:22.704 --> 01:06:25.366]  And you start connecting all the dots and you're seeing how it all maps up.
[01:06:25.406 --> 01:06:25.887]  You are 100% on point.
[01:06:27.947 --> 01:06:31.108]  I just never imagined that I would see it in my lifetime.
[01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:31.488]  It is.
[01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:32.588]  It's coming to fruition.
[01:06:32.928 --> 01:06:33.989]  You know, I've read all the greats.
[01:06:34.009 --> 01:06:37.630]  You know, 1984, you got Animal Farm, everything.
[01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.430]  You name it, it's all there.
[01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.551]  It's a pre-planned map.
[01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:42.891]  Well, let's walk back here.
[01:06:43.011 --> 01:06:48.393]  We know, as I said three weeks ago, that martial law, national civil emergency was declared over a month ago.
[01:06:48.773 --> 01:07:09.193]   Then about three weeks ago, we got word that they were already preparing and getting The interstate commerce travel ban, and they were getting it all locked in, and then now Trump's rolling it out in waves, trying not to panic the economy, but the left and the globalists are pushing him to do it faster and do it more hardcore and longer, which will end the economy forever.
[01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.312]  I had said Trump wasn't doing enough six weeks ago.
[01:07:14.352 --> 01:07:16.173]  They were going to blame him for the event, which happened.
[01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:20.057]  But now he's going too far, even though he's holding him back at a certain point.
[01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:22.699]  That's why our next guest is about to come on with us.
[01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:23.640]  We'll go back to your calls.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:28.504]  But yes, I talked to one of our well-known crew.
[01:07:28.524 --> 01:07:29.164]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:38.392]  Her father basically runs a large agricultural, let's say he's a manager in a large agricultural processing system in Missouri.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:52.611]  And just last night they got called in, they got given their secret Homeland Security licensure to keep operating and to be able to travel interstate in between the states.
[01:07:53.292 --> 01:08:02.760]  Now again, you look at the current emergencies, it's daycare, it's food, it's grocery stores, it's pharmacies, it's warehouses, it's media, obviously you take that off your North Korea.
[01:08:04.397 --> 01:08:11.366]  But they're talking about stuff even more intense to start actually shutting the restaurants and things down, which will create civil unrest.
[01:08:12.327 --> 01:08:13.769]  Trump has to know he's being set up.
[01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:24.187]   And so what you're saying is, and I'm trying to get copies of these, anybody that's got these blackout Identifying codes, anything else you want on there.
[01:08:24.787 --> 01:08:28.328]  I want to see these, because we've already got some of them, but I'm not authorized to show them yet.
[01:08:28.808 --> 01:08:32.350]  Some are governmental, continuity of government, kind of InfraGard type deals.
[01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.290]  People know what those are that know.
[01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:37.852]  And then others are just sheets from the company as a statement.
[01:08:38.732 --> 01:08:41.033]  Well, I'm printing those up for our crew that drives around.
[01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:42.133]  Hey, I work in broadcasting.
[01:08:42.193 --> 01:08:43.033]  I work in a warehouse.
[01:08:43.513 --> 01:08:44.294]  You know, things like that.
[01:08:44.913 --> 01:08:48.832]   that are protected under the Texas deal right now and will be. I'm not going to follow them after
[01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:53.554]   that if they say no you can't just shut the media down. You can say don't go to public events,
[01:08:53.554 --> 01:08:57.713]   that'd be martial law, but to say shut the newspapers and the tvs you can't go into work,
[01:08:57.713 --> 01:09:01.713]   no it'll be selective. Well that's that that's not just martial law, that's North Korean tyranny and
[01:09:01.713 --> 01:09:06.752]   I'm not going to follow it and nobody else should at that point. But this is a real balancing act so
[01:09:06.752 --> 01:09:12.033]  anybody that can do this send it to ShowTips.
[01:09:12.227 --> 01:09:14.209]  Showtips at Infowars.com.
[01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:16.131]  You know, so much comes into that.
[01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:18.092]  Maybe we should create a new one.
[01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:22.036]  Wes, can you create one during a break that just says 1919?
[01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.002]  No, let's just say Corona.
[01:09:29.682 --> 01:09:31.083]  Corona at Infowars.
[01:09:31.704 --> 01:09:33.806]  That'll get too many down the road as well, but just Corona.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:35.981]  At InfoWars.
[01:09:37.222 --> 01:09:37.582]  Thank you.
[01:09:37.962 --> 01:09:40.244]  Corona at InfoWars and just blackout.
[01:09:40.925 --> 01:09:41.665]  That's racist, sorry.
[01:09:42.206 --> 01:09:44.228]  Just erase whiteout.
[01:09:44.868 --> 01:09:47.170]  If you've got that or just use a black, sorry.
[01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.132]  That's the left, everything's racist.
[01:09:49.172 --> 01:09:50.052]  That's the mind control, folks.
[01:09:50.072 --> 01:09:51.994]  They're destabilizing us, turning us against each other.
[01:09:52.414 --> 01:09:58.259]  And just blackout all of the identifying stuff and send it to ShowTips and InfoWars.com.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:07.205]  And as immediately as I walk in through the first open garage bay door to get into the plant, my manager asked us to go and get these papers.
[01:10:07.225 --> 01:10:13.850]  I get the paper, I'm reading it as I'm walking to my workstation.
[01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:19.329]   I immediately as I walk in through the first open garage bay door to get into the plant,
[01:10:19.329 --> 01:10:21.490]  my manager asked us to go and get these papers.
[01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:24.610]  I get the paper, I'm reading it as I'm walking to my workstation.
[01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:25.610]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:28.530]  I mean, I've been following you for a long time.
[01:10:28.539 --> 01:10:29.340]  Long time listener.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.241]  First time caller.
[01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:31.922]  Me and my friend, we are diehard fans.
[01:10:32.003 --> 01:10:38.149]  But yes, what you've been talking about in Chronicle, you know, a lot of people, wherever they live, it might not be there.
[01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:45.878]  You're saying on the sheet it says you're allowed to go, it's key what it says, it says you're allowed to go out and get across state lines, or you're allowed to travel, period.
[01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:49.352]  I'm just allowed to travel to work and from home.
[01:10:49.432 --> 01:10:51.694]  I have to present this paper and they read it.
[01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:56.597]  At the bottom of the paper is the telephone number for the plant I worked at and the address of the specific plant.
[01:10:56.637 --> 01:11:03.482]  Yeah, so they're all creating, via Homeland Security's direction, internal company passports that the police know them and call the number.
[01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:05.563]  And that's how I figured this would go.
[01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:13.290]  And then, of course, later they're going to phase it into actual passes, and then it'll be an app on your phone the government issues you to even be able to travel.
[01:11:13.491 --> 01:11:15.833]  And they'll need 18 months to implement permanent martial law.
[01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:18.255]  So what this is, is the implementation of permanent martial law.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.581]  Oh yes and no, of course.
[01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:22.323]  This is how they're first going to roll it out.
[01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.546]  I mean, it's just going to be over the course of a day.
[01:11:24.566 --> 01:11:25.727]  I mean, think about it.
[01:11:25.787 --> 01:11:30.452]  In Georgia, there's so many people who have registered guns and unregistered guns.
[01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:31.573]  They can't track them all at once.
[01:11:31.773 --> 01:11:36.018]  They're just going to throw it out in certain places where they know they'll have to deal with certain things.
[01:11:36.437 --> 01:11:39.099]  I guarantee you in Georgia, they're not going to mention a word about it.
[01:11:39.159 --> 01:11:42.761]  You go to bed, the next day you wake up, you're driving to work, bam, another roadblock.
[01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:44.742]  But this one is from Georgia to Tennessee.
[01:11:45.002 --> 01:11:46.203]  That's a whole new rigmarole.
[01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:55.529]  Just because I crossed from one state into another, and then back the other way, it's going to, you're going to have- Well I can tell you, that's how the checkpoints are going to start.
[01:11:56.109 --> 01:12:03.911]  Then they're going to have highly publicized checkpoints to scare everybody, and a sea of the police and military will follow it, because they haven't gotten the robots in place yet completely.
[01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:05.451]  That's about 10 years out.
[01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:15.574]  It'll be all combat robots on the ground, there'll be a heavy tank combat robot, there'll be a couple of sentry robots heavily armed, and then there'll be like little political robots that go, like, how are you doing?
[01:12:15.634 --> 01:12:16.194]  Let me help you.
[01:12:16.254 --> 01:12:17.054]  Are you feeling well?
[01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:18.655]  And then you're going to have drones above.
[01:12:18.715 --> 01:12:21.175]  They've all psych warfare-ed the whole deal.
[01:12:21.215 --> 01:12:22.216]  They've all pre-programmed it.
[01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:22.856]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:23.436 --> 01:12:25.738]  Now we're going to get to Joe in Jersey.
[01:12:25.778 --> 01:12:27.240]  We're going to get to Christian in Houston.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.181]  We're going to get to Peter in Washington.
[01:12:29.602 --> 01:12:30.743]  We're going to get to Dawson.
[01:12:31.183 --> 01:12:32.164]  We're going to get to Nick.
[01:12:32.184 --> 01:12:33.245]  We're going to get to Steven.
[01:12:33.265 --> 01:12:34.266]  We're going to get to Jim.
[01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:34.887]  We're going to get to Brad.
[01:12:34.907 --> 01:12:35.707]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:12:36.328 --> 01:12:37.669]  Everybody on the board.
[01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:38.790]  I'll get to you before I end this.
[01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:40.952]  But no more calls after that.
[01:12:41.012 --> 01:12:42.033]  So I just want people to have to hold.
[01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:43.274]  We're very appreciative you called in.
[01:12:43.294 --> 01:12:43.895]  Amazing calls.
[01:12:44.997 --> 01:12:47.279]  Robert Barnes, of course, is a famous constitutional lawyer.
[01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:48.661]  He's a criminal lawyer.
[01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:50.302]  He's a First Amendment lawyer.
[01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:55.467]  And he's done a lot of great work for us as a lawyer and does some great work for us advising us right now.
[01:12:56.028 --> 01:13:00.952]  And he joins us because he's really concerned, like I am, at the real target.
[01:13:02.054 --> 01:13:03.754]  I mean, no doubt about it.
[01:13:03.634 --> 01:13:08.594]   AP and others coming out of CNBC. Wow, the economy is generating faster than we thought.
[01:13:08.594 --> 01:13:13.313]   And so here to give us his analysis for the next really 15, 20 minutes, I'm going to give
[01:13:13.313 --> 01:13:17.873]   him the floor. So Bob, let it roar with your expert. I really respect you. You're a smart
[01:13:17.873 --> 01:13:20.793]   cookie, one of the smartest I know, with what you really think is going on and what you
[01:13:20.793 --> 01:13:21.793]  think the main target is.
[01:13:21.793 --> 01:13:26.213]   I mean, no doubt about it. I mean, well, the first thing that stands out or that comes
[01:13:26.213 --> 01:13:32.634]   up is the degree to which, I mean, going into the worries that a virus will give the government
[01:13:32.634 --> 01:13:39.234]   the ability to seize power and in an unchecked way is coming to bear.
[01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:47.336]  I mean, for example, the Hong Kong protests, which were rocking the entire country of China, have now disappeared because of the virus.
[01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:57.862]   The Yellow Vest protests that were rocking Macron's government in France, And actually having an effect across Europe and the world has also now disappeared.
[01:13:58.403 --> 01:14:12.158]  Just today, Politico has reported that the Department of Justice here in the United States is seeking approval for indefinite detention and imprisonment of an American citizen without any conviction of a crime or anything wrong that person has done.
[01:14:12.734 --> 01:14:17.519]  They want authority to extend quarantine power beyond that which it's ever been approved of.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.082]  Now, there's a lot of bad legal precedents out there.
[01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:32.556]  I had a debate years ago with a legal scholar about how one of the biggest legal loopholes in the entire constitutional structure of the federal government and our state governments was quarantine power.
[01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:50.752]  That in the name of public health, governments can, under various precedents that currently exist and continue to exist, seize power in ways that violate every single constitutional right or liberty you have, and courts have historically turned a blind eye to it and refused to enforce constitutional protections.
[01:14:51.372 --> 01:14:58.317]  Just a few years ago in Arizona, someone was detained against his will because they claimed he had a communicable disease.
[01:14:58.418 --> 01:14:59.118]  He said he didn't.
[01:14:59.518 --> 01:15:00.319]  They claimed he did.
[01:15:00.339 --> 01:15:04.642]  He went through a long, extensive fight, ended up in prison for a year, and guess what?
[01:15:04.882 --> 01:15:05.803]  It turned out he was right.
[01:15:06.263 --> 01:15:07.384]  The government was wrong.
[01:15:07.424 --> 01:15:08.905]  He didn't even have the communicable disease.
[01:15:09.286 --> 01:15:15.340]   But if the mere allegation that you have a disease is sufficient to or or might have a
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.390]   disease because that's what most of these shutdown orders are based on.
[01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:21.919]   They're based on you might have it or might get it. Well think about what
[01:15:21.919 --> 01:15:23.220]  evidentiary standard that is.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.539]   I said I wouldn't interrupt but let me just back up here. I realize I keep
[01:15:26.539 --> 01:15:31.060]   saying Hong Kong thereafter Hong Kong too. It was Taiwan that embarrassed Xi Jinping
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:36.099]   and and and now he's used this to shut that all down. But as a legal scholar and
[01:15:36.099 --> 01:15:40.380]   respect a constitutional lawyer am I wrong to say that there is a corporate
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.660]   institutional attempt governmental attempt here and the buck stops with
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.340]   Trump so I'm not blaming him but because he's trying to resist it a little bit
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.860]  but not enough.
[01:15:48.453 --> 01:15:55.437]  That this is permanent state of martial law enforced by a robot technocracy with a medical tyranny behind it?
[01:15:55.457 --> 01:15:57.438]  I mean, talk about a nightmare dystopia.
[01:15:57.758 --> 01:16:03.742]  Am I exaggerating to call this the twilight of freedom and the onset of permanent martial law?
[01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:10.484]  That is a serious and severe risk that is being way discounted by too many people in the country.
[01:16:10.824 --> 01:16:11.464]  Just look around.
[01:16:11.524 --> 01:16:21.629]  You have people like the mayor of New Orleans and other city and county officials across the country claiming now an emergency power to prohibit people from purchasing, buying or selling guns.
[01:16:21.729 --> 01:16:31.293]  One of the great concerns about the issue of the background checks was what would happen if people use the, the government used the excuse of the background check to simply deny purchase altogether.
[01:16:31.869 --> 01:16:38.497]  For example, the theory was that what will happen is at some point in the future, the government will simply never process your background check.
[01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:43.764]  And that way, they can prohibit you from buying and selling a gun, even though on paper, it's just a background check.
[01:16:44.044 --> 01:16:47.568]  They just never process your background check when you would be otherwise cleared.
[01:16:47.809 --> 01:16:50.252]  Well, that's already starting to happen in some parts of the country.
[01:16:51.032 --> 01:16:59.195]  Right now, if you wanted to form a petition for a political protest, you wouldn't be able to get the petition or the permit to do so in almost any city or state in the country.
[01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:00.476]  Definitely not in any major city or state.
[01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:08.939]  And you're under a specific order in some states, or at least being interpreted as, having to stay home except for essential business work, like your caller was just talking about.
[01:17:09.179 --> 01:17:09.939]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:12.280]  That means you can't go out and publicly protest, does it not?
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.522]  This is the scope of it.
[01:17:14.722 --> 01:17:28.634]  You're having Fourth Amendment issues with the way they're using surveillance and cooperating with private companies and the government to track people's behavior, to track people's locations, to track people's conduct, all in the name of let's prevent this virus based on questionable data and modeling.
[01:17:29.134 --> 01:17:33.798]  And so I think you look at all these con... what's happening, not only here, but around the world.
[01:17:34.219 --> 01:17:36.220]  I mean, I was concerned right away.
[01:17:36.661 --> 01:17:39.023]  I was concerned about the virus because you were raising that concern.
[01:17:39.123 --> 01:17:42.165]  Other people were raising that concern very early that this could become a pandemic.
[01:17:42.545 --> 01:17:56.017]  There's been over decades of warnings to China in particular because of their culinary habits, because of their... particularly with bats, because bats carry a wide range of unique viruses that once transmitted to humans, they're tough to deter.
[01:17:57.138 --> 01:18:00.401]  And the way the Chinese government was trying to suppress it initially.
[01:18:00.762 --> 01:18:04.726]  But clearly there's been an overreaction by governments around the world.
[01:18:04.826 --> 01:18:18.540]  And one of my first triggers, Peter Hitchens, the brother of Christopher Hitchens, great iconoclastic intellectual from the United Kingdom, right away said, as soon as everybody in power agrees on something, you immediately should become skeptical, not trustworthy.
[01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:32.169]  And when you have all of these governments around the world all agreeing with one another suddenly to do something as extreme as shut down their entire economy and civil society in a way that frankly didn't even happen during World War I or World War II.
[01:18:32.529 --> 01:18:35.972]  We still had much more functioning economy than we have right now in parts of the world.
[01:18:37.303 --> 01:18:56.616]  Their willingness to do so suggests a coordination, suggests a degree of powerful institutions and individuals that are pursuing this for their own objectives and agenda, and as a practical experiment in how much power can a government seize without people second-guessing it or questioning it under these contexts.
[01:18:56.776 --> 01:18:58.398]  They couldn't achieve this with the threat of terrorism.
[01:18:58.438 --> 01:18:59.278]  They only got so far.
[01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.721]  They could only achieve this through the threat of crime.
[01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:04.202]  There again, they only got so far.
[01:19:04.762 --> 01:19:26.724]   But it's clearly they are learning that telling people, hey, a pandemic is coming and it's going to kill everybody or kill tons of people and our hospitals are going to be overcrowded, that just the threat of it, like the movie V for V for Vendetta, where they premised the entire totalitarian society being able to seize power on the threat of a a pandemic and then secretly had the vaccine for the
[01:19:26.724 --> 01:19:31.335]   pandemic all along and enriching themselves in the process as well. Well, we're seeing it practically.
[01:19:31.335 --> 01:19:36.364]   I mean, you have they're seeing a degree of public compliance that we almost have never seen
[01:19:36.364 --> 01:19:40.564]   before. And as the government says, you're not going to go to work today. You're not going to
[01:19:40.564 --> 01:19:41.895]  take your kid to school today.
[01:19:41.895 --> 01:19:46.055]   You're not going to go to church today. You're not going to go to a concert or a theater or
[01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:49.814]   public event today. You're not going to hang out with your friends today. You're not going to go
[01:19:49.814 --> 01:19:54.134]   out into the street today. And ninety nine point nine percent of the world is complying.
[01:19:54.864 --> 01:19:58.165]  And anyone who doesn't, they mock, they satirize, they critique.
[01:19:58.425 --> 01:20:02.167]  And then they're starting to escalate the rhetoric now to these people really are threats.
[01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:13.711]  You're going to see the same logic they use against people who raise questions about the safeties of vaccines start to be used against anybody who raises questions about the safety of these mitigation tactics involving panics.
[01:20:14.111 --> 01:20:19.097]  They're going to say, oh, these are the kind of people who want to bring disease into your school, disease into your neighborhood, disease into community.
[01:20:19.318 --> 01:20:20.659]  They really want to kill grandma.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:28.709]  Anytime I've raised questions about this, routinely and repeatedly attacked across the board from a wide using those kind of arguments.
[01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:32.434]  So I think we're going to see that this is a very dangerous time for two big reasons.
[01:20:32.814 --> 01:20:45.398]  For the reasons that you identify, which is that this is a severe threat because the governments have historically used the threat of a virus to seize power in ways that they could never do in any other context.
[01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:58.126]   And what my two cents on that is, is from a lawyer's perspective in America, The most dangerous precedents for executive power and state power in this country are in the virus context.
[01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:04.351]  It's in the virus context that you see people are shocked to discover, okay, can someone just come to your house, arrest you, do what they did in China?
[01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:08.535]  Lock everybody down and then drag them out of their apartments whenever they wanted to.
[01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:11.267]  Could that happen here in the United States?
[01:21:11.287 --> 01:21:12.208]  Well, on paper, no.
[01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:14.489]  But our legal history says the opposite.
[01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:18.252]  Our legal history shows that there have been examples where there have been virus pandemics.
[01:21:18.532 --> 01:21:20.593]  There's been a panic reaction to that pandemic.
[01:21:20.914 --> 01:21:23.996]  The government has used it to seize power they could never otherwise seize.
[01:21:24.476 --> 01:21:31.260]  Taking people, just recently, like I said, within the last 10-15 years in Arizona, they did it to an individual.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.801]  They locked him up against his will.
[01:21:33.161 --> 01:21:36.696]   They refused To let them do anything, and it turned out they were wrong.
[01:21:36.716 --> 01:21:39.300]  They locked them up for about a year or so, illegitimately.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.384]  But so, our precedents are that governments can do this.
[01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:45.008]  And look at how quickly they're rushing to do it.
[01:21:45.876 --> 01:21:56.002]  Today there's an announcement in the Hill that they're going to send the National Guard out for the purposes of monitoring and helping with the testing and things of that nature.
[01:21:56.462 --> 01:22:01.305]  I mean, does anyone really accept that that's what the full intention is of some of the people that are pushing this panic?
[01:22:02.025 --> 01:22:03.646]  It's an easy pretext to seize power.
[01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:08.969]  If this was happening in China or Russia, we would immediately spot it as an attempted power grab.
[01:22:09.729 --> 01:22:22.495]  Uh, then we should be... Our risk is far higher if we don't pay attention and if we're not calling things out and if we're not warning people of the worst possible consequences than if we stay silent, stay mute, and censor ourselves.
[01:22:22.935 --> 01:22:27.437]  The second dangerous component of this is they are truly sinking the economy.
[01:22:27.998 --> 01:22:31.460]  So, I mean, already people don't fully realize what's happening on Wall Street.
[01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:38.105]  We have a lot of a debt-driven system where corporations have been buying back their stock, and much of the stock market increase is due to that.
[01:22:38.746 --> 01:22:41.027]  And so consequently, here's a big warning sign.
[01:22:41.607 --> 01:22:48.212]  The Federal Reserve, there's an overnight market where you buy and sell various forms of debt, and it's called the repo market.
[01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:53.796]  And it, in fact, is critical to the liquidity of every major corporation in the country and every government, including our own.
[01:22:54.685 --> 01:23:00.272]  And it was that market's problems in substantial part that led to the 2009 financial crisis.
[01:23:00.793 --> 01:23:07.281]  Well, the Fed usually helps guarantee money, just prints money and throws it into the system to keep it afloat.
[01:23:07.904 --> 01:23:11.465]  Well, normally, though, they cap it at between $50 to $75 billion.
[01:23:11.585 --> 01:23:13.245]  Then they went up to $150 billion.
[01:23:13.665 --> 01:23:17.086]  This week, they went up to $1 trillion a day.
[01:23:17.586 --> 01:23:28.349]  In fact, the Fed has committed to put more money on their balance sheet, four times more money on their balance sheet, than they did in all of the financial crisis of 2008 in just the next 30 days.
[01:23:28.749 --> 01:23:33.110]  They're committing to printing as much money as more than half the national debt.
[01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:36.171]  So this has Weimar Republic written all over it.
[01:23:37.111 --> 01:23:37.431]  Exactly.
[01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:39.352]  People forget, those things happen fast.
[01:23:39.632 --> 01:23:40.772]  Those things didn't happen slow.
[01:23:41.593 --> 01:23:47.535]  The Great Depression happened in about six months, and we spent 12 years trying to get our way out of it, and it took a world war to do so.
[01:23:47.895 --> 01:23:55.318]  The Weimar Republic, I was telling somebody the other day, if you want to watch a documentary on what might be coming down the pipeline, watch the show Babylon Berlin.
[01:23:56.115 --> 01:24:02.858]  Which is about the German Republic during the German era, the Berlin population during that era.
[01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:08.361]  And one of the fascinating things they portray is they show how 95% of the people didn't take Nazis seriously at all.
[01:24:08.761 --> 01:24:11.083]  Up until the time the Nazis actually had power.
[01:24:11.523 --> 01:24:13.904]  So there was this slow reaction to risk.
[01:24:14.224 --> 01:24:19.467]  There was nobody, there was no Alex Jones calling it out and crying out and warning people of the risk.
[01:24:19.908 --> 01:24:26.847]   in Germany and those that were were on smaller scale and were of course systematically ignored.
[01:24:26.847 --> 01:24:32.468]   And so here, you and I both have a lot of friends and family and community and other
[01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:34.188]  people that are in the working class community.
[01:24:34.188 --> 01:24:36.307]  I don't think anybody that's advising Trump does.
[01:24:36.307 --> 01:24:38.688]  I don't think anybody in the press does.
[01:24:38.688 --> 01:24:43.508]   So they understand that one week of unemployment, that they got basically enough money to survive
[01:24:43.508 --> 01:24:44.508]  one to two weeks.
[01:24:44.851 --> 01:24:49.333]  A typical person in America, blue-collar guy in America, has about 400 bucks in savings in his bank account.
[01:24:49.653 --> 01:24:52.494]  He can survive one week, maybe two at the most.
[01:24:52.694 --> 01:24:54.535]  Unemployment on average pays less than half.
[01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:59.057]  That's right, about half the country is either on welfare or living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:25:00.148 --> 01:25:00.828]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:25:00.868 --> 01:25:05.350]  And from an experimental perspective, the government creates massively dependent population.
[01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:06.390]  You want health care?
[01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:07.771]  Now you can only get it from the government.
[01:25:08.011 --> 01:25:09.491]  You want to be able to pay your bills?
[01:25:09.511 --> 01:25:10.531]  You can only get it from the government.
[01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:11.792]  You want to be able to live in your house?
[01:25:11.812 --> 01:25:12.912]  You can only get it from the government.
[01:25:13.092 --> 01:25:14.033]  You want access to food?
[01:25:14.053 --> 01:25:16.894]  You're going to need the funds to be able to buy it, and you're going to need to get that from the government.
[01:25:17.294 --> 01:25:19.935]  So that's the great danger with this accelerating climate.
[01:25:20.075 --> 01:25:21.135]  I want to ask you this question.
[01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:40.005]   How long do you think it'll be until a Depression is irreversible, and as overextended as we are, as drugged out as we are, as much on welfare as we are, as divided as we are, we are going to be way, I think, more pliant to the government, but also more destructive to each other than the Great Depression.
[01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:43.227]  I mean, I think we are in the most dangerous point in American history right now.
[01:25:44.404 --> 01:25:44.985]  No doubt about it.
[01:25:45.245 --> 01:25:49.749]  We're within 30 to 45 days of hitting depression-era irreversible trends.
[01:25:49.949 --> 01:25:50.629]  I totally agree.
[01:25:50.649 --> 01:25:51.991]  That's the number I come up with.
[01:25:52.271 --> 01:25:53.212]  It's watching it unravel.
[01:25:53.252 --> 01:25:54.152]  How do you come to that number?
[01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:54.953]  I know you're a numbers guy.
[01:25:55.774 --> 01:26:05.702]  Goldman Sachs is predicting 24% contraction just in the second quarter and unemployment rate of double digits, which in practical terms is the equivalent of about 20% under the old definition in the 1920s.
[01:26:05.722 --> 01:26:06.823]  That's right, a depression.
[01:26:06.983 --> 01:26:07.404]  Exactly.
[01:26:09.246 --> 01:26:12.267]  And they're talking about 50% unemployment within six months.
[01:26:12.607 --> 01:26:15.348]  And let me move to this now, Mr. Barnes.
[01:26:16.568 --> 01:26:20.610]  David Knight, at Libertarian on Twitter.
[01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:21.730]  Dr. McHamshot, please.
[01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:23.691]  Here is his tweet.
[01:26:25.271 --> 01:26:36.160]  I was just asking callers earlier, calling in about how they're all getting their critical infrastructure notes from the state police, from the governors, from their bosses, that they're allowed to travel outside their house.
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.082]  This is your papers to leave in Nazi Germany.
[01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:41.804]  Note expiration date at bottom, April 2021.
[01:26:43.405 --> 01:26:46.388]  And sure enough, David's been sent one of them, more coming in right now.
[01:26:47.611 --> 01:26:49.172]  Corona at Infowars.com.
[01:26:49.212 --> 01:26:49.792]  Send them in, folks.
[01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:51.773]  The black amount like this guy's done.
[01:26:52.794 --> 01:26:55.756]  Bigger than hashtag COVID-19.
[01:26:56.556 --> 01:27:00.399]  Reference statute gives exemptions for essential delivery under curfew.
[01:27:01.199 --> 01:27:03.440]  Military doctrine, hashtag martial law 2020.
[01:27:04.241 --> 01:27:06.262]  Hashtag lockdown movement.
[01:27:06.482 --> 01:27:07.223]  Communications.
[01:27:08.063 --> 01:27:08.643]  And then it goes.
[01:27:08.703 --> 01:27:10.044]  Here is the actual letter.
[01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:14.447]  We can just click on the letter there for folks on Twitter, please.
[01:27:14.467 --> 01:27:16.188]  And we'll give them a full screen shot.
[01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:20.128]  Let's give folks the HD if we can.
[01:27:20.449 --> 01:27:21.229]  There we go, thank you.
[01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:31.116]  This certificate of post-disaster re-entry is to and identifies the bearer as representative of a certified.
[01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:35.560]  So they're using the martial law localized of a hurricane, but this is general for a year.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:47.285]  In accordance with the NCGS 166A-19.70 and grants the bearer the privilege of entering a designated curfew.
[01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:48.066]  You have privilege now.
[01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:50.687]  As provided, the following requirements are met.
[01:27:51.377 --> 01:28:07.370]  There is a declaration of state of emergency or state of disaster in effect, and there's a curfew in effect in the declared area, and the governor has issued an executive order invoking the privileges listed in NCGS 166A-19.70.
[01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.091]  And watch, you'll have to have the vaccine.
[01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:10.012]  You'll have it in a few minutes.
[01:28:10.032 --> 01:28:11.813]  You'll have to have the vaccine to travel now, folks.
[01:28:12.903 --> 01:28:14.903]  Not just on an airplane, but out of your house.
[01:28:14.903 --> 01:28:19.302]   Four, entries shall be granted for the limited purpose of delivering or assisting in the
[01:28:19.302 --> 01:28:23.742]   distribution of essentials or assisting in the restoration of utility services.
[01:28:23.742 --> 01:28:29.382]   Five, the bearer of this certificate and all associates must follow the route specialized
[01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:31.543]  by law enforcement or other local official of any.
[01:28:31.649 --> 01:28:33.791]  So you must only drive on the roads you're authorized to.
[01:28:34.212 --> 01:28:40.338]  This is martial law according to Black's Law Dictionary, which it says there is no law in martial law.
[01:28:40.598 --> 01:28:45.764]  It's whatever they want to do till someone in power claims they've restored the order.
[01:28:46.204 --> 01:28:46.765]  Robert Barnes.
[01:28:48.154 --> 01:28:49.135]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[01:28:49.516 --> 01:28:51.779]  I'll give him credit for using creative language.
[01:28:51.819 --> 01:28:59.970]  I mean, Governor Newsom was more of a dim-witted guy, so he actually sort of blurted it out earlier this week and then had to retract.
[01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:03.816]  He's like, oh, I didn't mean martial law or anything like that or the National Guard coming out of this way.
[01:29:04.356 --> 01:29:13.580]  And instead they're using language like curfew, using language like stay at home, using language that sounds much nicer than martial law.
[01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:21.324]  But the effect of what they're declaring is, in the name of the police power of the state, we're going to suspend all of your rights and liberties until we say otherwise.
[01:29:21.504 --> 01:29:29.868]  And the bureaucrats are all, just like in California, they're all exempt from tickets, license plate reading cameras, they're all smiling, they're going to be the new royalty.
[01:29:31.024 --> 01:29:47.457]  I mean, you look at what's happening, because I was pointing out to someone the other day, you look at all of our core constitutional liberties here in the States, and you look at the same principles applied around the world, where we've already seen the violation of them, we really don't have First Amendment full rights at this point because we can't publicly protest or get a petition to form a public protest.
[01:29:48.226 --> 01:29:52.187]  We can't even leave our homes to protest in many of the cities and states in the country.
[01:29:52.907 --> 01:30:00.289]  Secondly, you look at the Second Amendment, they're already effectively, there's mayors and county governments and city governments saying that they can suspend the sale of firearms.
[01:30:00.309 --> 01:30:04.490]  They're going to say that the firearms are not an essential business and thereby close it down.
[01:30:05.251 --> 01:30:11.892]  And alternatively, they're shutting down their background check operations so that they can basically stop all gun sales by simply having them look at the process.
[01:30:11.912 --> 01:30:12.313]  Oh, you're right.
[01:30:12.353 --> 01:30:19.180]   And with four states as of this Friday, Four states, in four states, four cities, Democrats have said, shut down your gun shops, they're not essential.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.402]  So it's already begun.
[01:30:20.462 --> 01:30:23.466]  They're selectively using this arbitrary power.
[01:30:24.631 --> 01:30:25.011]  Exactly.
[01:30:25.352 --> 01:30:32.637]  And then the other way to do so, it's a sort of classic sort of Soviet kind of mindset, is you simply shut down the background check operation and then nobody can buy a gun.
[01:30:33.378 --> 01:30:42.805]  Because what happens is before you're allowed to buy it, you have to pass the background check and they never pass you on the background check, not because you failed it, but because there's no government employees there to process it.
[01:30:43.085 --> 01:30:47.929]  Because they shut down that part of the government operations in the name of efficiency and virus pandemic.
[01:30:48.487 --> 01:30:58.434]  Then you look at people's Fourth Amendment rights in terms of their rights for privacy, their rights against the invasion of that privacy, security of their homes, security of their intimacies, and information included.
[01:30:58.474 --> 01:31:04.558]  That's been kind of intervened with the government working together with Big Tech to surveil people again in the name of the virus.
[01:31:04.578 --> 01:31:05.759]  We need to track people in the name of the virus.
[01:31:05.579 --> 01:31:07.898]   of the virus. We need to know everywhere you're at. We need to know everybody you've been
[01:31:07.898 --> 01:31:11.899]   talking to. We need to know anybody you've been in physical contact with in order to
[01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:13.378]  prevent the virus.
[01:31:13.378 --> 01:31:17.899]   This is the end of basically everything that makes us a free society. It's all clearly
[01:31:17.899 --> 01:31:21.418]   been pre-planned. If you can tomorrow, Robert, I've been wanting to get you on.
[01:31:21.397 --> 01:31:21.997]  I've been too busy.
[01:31:22.337 --> 01:31:23.698]  Please come on during the weekday show.
[01:31:23.758 --> 01:31:25.700]  Monday, I'd love to have you on, say, in the third hour.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:34.447]  I'd love to have you come on tomorrow evening in the second hour to get the law together, which I know you have in your head, but maybe send us some exhibits to Daria.
[01:31:34.467 --> 01:31:38.451]  We'll put them on screen and really do the trajectory of this and then your warning to Trump.
[01:31:38.971 --> 01:31:40.792]  We have another guest and a bunch of calls I've got to get to.
[01:31:40.812 --> 01:31:41.513]  Sorry I got to you late.
[01:31:41.533 --> 01:31:44.035]  We had some technical stuff launching a special transmission.
[01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:49.679]  But can you just, in a minute or two, give us your... I know you'll give us your real view on where you think Trump is.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.200]  I don't think he likes this.
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.301]  He tried to block it up front.
[01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:53.222]  He tried to play it down.
[01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:55.404]  Then he realized the hysteria is too big.
[01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:56.525]  He's got to ride the tiger.
[01:31:56.905 --> 01:31:58.406]  But I don't want him to go with it too much.
[01:31:58.766 --> 01:31:59.767]  What's this balancing act?
[01:31:59.787 --> 01:32:00.408]  This nuance?
[01:32:00.468 --> 01:32:01.869]  Or do you think Trump's part of the problem?
[01:32:02.329 --> 01:32:03.190]  What's your message to Trump?
[01:32:04.895 --> 01:32:06.036]  I don't think Trump's part of the problem at all.
[01:32:06.056 --> 01:32:09.579]  He was the only major national leader pushing back on the panic from the inception.
[01:32:10.279 --> 01:32:12.361]  And what happened was he just ran out of room.
[01:32:12.721 --> 01:32:20.547]  In other words, once Wall Street started collapsing anyway, once state governments were starting to shut things down anyway, once foreign governments in Europe were shutting down... That's right.
[01:32:20.567 --> 01:32:25.371]  The bureaucracy put in their own martial law in a mutinous fashion.
[01:32:25.411 --> 01:32:31.396]  So he literally had to join it to try to ride it and control it or be made obsolescent.
[01:32:32.443 --> 01:32:32.803]  Exactly.
[01:32:32.823 --> 01:32:39.345]  The ride of the tiger is the perfect imagery, because I think it was Sam Adams who pointed that out.
[01:32:39.365 --> 01:32:43.225]  He said, be careful when you ride a tiger about the American Revolution that the tiger doesn't devour you.
[01:32:43.605 --> 01:32:45.886]  So I think Trump is trying that careful balance.
[01:32:45.966 --> 01:32:51.887]  My greatest concern is that there's literally no one advising Trump, I think, giving him accurate and honest information.
[01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:59.769]  I mean, as an example, I have reason to believe that Trump was advised by people that Julian Assange had caused American soldiers to die in the field.
[01:33:00.845 --> 01:33:02.847]  And that's how they got Trump to back down off of U.S.
[01:33:02.867 --> 01:33:05.270]  government, of stopping the prosecution of him?
[01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:06.070]  Exactly.
[01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:08.072]  This is a smokescreen too for Deep State.
[01:33:08.713 --> 01:33:10.515]  It rolls out the cashless society.
[01:33:10.855 --> 01:33:11.756]  It creates total fear.
[01:33:11.796 --> 01:33:13.277]  It sells the surveillance society.
[01:33:13.578 --> 01:33:15.580]  It plunges markets for a global reset.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.702]  It helps authoritarian regimes.
[01:33:17.742 --> 01:33:18.603]  They can blame Trump.
[01:33:19.123 --> 01:33:20.525]  It's absolutely fantastic.
[01:33:21.755 --> 01:33:23.996]  They also think they can print their way out of any problem now.
[01:33:24.436 --> 01:33:34.839]  So the key economic policy advisors have been watching the Fed in close detail, because usually the people with big money will be telling you what they really think by what they're doing with their money, and they were hitting panic buttons all over the place.
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:38.481]  Whether it was in response to the virus, I don't think that's what it was.
[01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:42.402]  I think it was in response to what they saw governments planning to do with the virus.
[01:33:42.822 --> 01:33:47.461]   And there's been various economic advisors that believe that you can just print your way out of it.
[01:33:47.461 --> 01:33:51.862]   That the Fed can print ceaseless amounts of money and through a wide range of techniques that are available to
[01:33:51.862 --> 01:33:55.282]   them, including their operations in the repo market, including
[01:33:55.282 --> 01:34:00.931]   their operations in the community, in the commercial market, their involvement in other
[01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:04.770]   support markets, whereby they can effectively buy, for example, all of the
[01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:06.381]  stocks and bonds in the country.
[01:34:06.406 --> 01:34:10.107]  There's even talks that they may do so, that they may basically own a majority of U.S.
[01:34:10.127 --> 01:34:10.307]  companies.
[01:34:10.347 --> 01:34:12.008]  Like Europe's saying, they're going to nationalize.
[01:34:12.028 --> 01:34:13.368]  And again, it's all a globalist plan.
[01:34:13.388 --> 01:34:16.149]  That's why it's following how the globalists demand.
[01:34:16.169 --> 01:34:20.150]  You must do it like this, Trump, or we'll blame you and we'll blame the death and we'll blame the collapse.
[01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:22.010]  He does what they want and it only gets worse.
[01:34:22.331 --> 01:34:23.911]  So we've got to ask, where are they leading us?
[01:34:23.971 --> 01:34:26.312]  Total global nationalization under the mega banks.
[01:34:26.572 --> 01:34:27.532]  Even mainstream news says that.
[01:34:28.052 --> 01:34:30.715]  Think about the solutions and what the people can do.
[01:34:31.396 --> 01:34:32.898]  You will join us tomorrow in the second hour?
[01:34:33.719 --> 01:34:34.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.522]  Okay, so I guess we're all locked down at home anyways.
[01:34:36.803 --> 01:34:41.668]  So that's 5 o'clock Central and that'll be your time out there in Vegas.
[01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:42.710]  I guess that's 3 o'clock?
[01:34:43.591 --> 01:34:43.711]  Yep.
[01:34:44.414 --> 01:34:45.555]  All right, three o'clock tomorrow.
[01:34:45.615 --> 01:34:46.595]  Think about solutions.
[01:34:46.655 --> 01:34:49.376]  Recap the last 30 minutes and the first few segments tomorrow.
[01:34:49.396 --> 01:34:50.637]  This is so important with new developments.
[01:34:50.677 --> 01:34:54.419]  And then give us your solutions, because I know the White House and others are listening.
[01:34:54.459 --> 01:34:54.999]  It's no brag.
[01:34:55.039 --> 01:34:55.619]  It's just fact.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.720]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[01:34:58.661 --> 01:34:58.981]  Absolutely.
[01:34:59.001 --> 01:34:59.501]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:00.502]  And give folks your Twitter.
[01:35:02.983 --> 01:35:04.964]  Oh, at Barnes underscore law.
[01:35:05.624 --> 01:35:06.765]  At Barnes underscore law.
[01:35:06.985 --> 01:35:07.665]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:35:08.665 --> 01:35:09.306]  Hey, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:35:09.366 --> 01:35:09.646]  Bye-bye.
[01:35:09.986 --> 01:35:11.927]  And guys, let's get his interview excised out.
[01:35:11.967 --> 01:35:13.228]  That was extremely powerful.
[01:35:14.415 --> 01:35:16.558]  And let's get that out to him so he tweets it.
[01:35:16.638 --> 01:35:16.838]  Okay.
[01:35:17.959 --> 01:35:19.081]  We got a little bit behind today.
[01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:23.525]  We're going to our guests in about seven, eight minutes, but I'll never get to the calls.
[01:35:23.546 --> 01:35:24.987]  I don't start getting to them now.
[01:35:25.007 --> 01:35:28.651]  So I'm gonna take three calls right now, quickly, from those that hold the longest.
[01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:31.034]  Then I'll go to my guest for about 20 minutes, who's got amazing information.
[01:35:31.354 --> 01:35:34.378]  Then I'm gonna go into the next hour taking your calls, the ones that are on the board.
[01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:42.338]  Peter has been holding a long time, Doss has been holding a long time, Jim, and I'll get to Steve and Brad and X and others that are holding.
[01:35:43.099 --> 01:35:44.620]  So let's go to Peter in Washington.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.943]  Thanks for holding her on the air on this special Emergency Saturday Transmission.
[01:35:48.884 --> 01:35:51.946]  Alex, this event has torn the mask off of Big Pharma.
[01:35:52.287 --> 01:36:02.576]  In January, they were pushing the flu vaccine like your life depended on it, but at the same time, they didn't have enough surgical masks for first responders, emergency room doctors and nurses.
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:07.470]  This is a lesson to America that Big Pharma does not have our best interests in mind.
[01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:13.695]  And another thing to remember is they can, after the fact, code the cause of death any way they want.
[01:36:14.075 --> 01:36:18.659]  If Trump overreacts, they'll say all the old people died the old man's friend, pneumonia.
[01:36:19.079 --> 01:36:22.943]  If Trump underreacts, they'll say they all died of COVID-19.
[01:36:23.543 --> 01:36:26.145]  Trump has got to walk the middle of the road.
[01:36:26.225 --> 01:36:30.289]  He's got to take the energy and the fear this has generated and turn it into MAGA.
[01:36:30.953 --> 01:36:33.154]  Bring home the antibiotic production.
[01:36:33.494 --> 01:36:35.574]  Bring home the pharmaceutical production.
[01:36:35.994 --> 01:36:38.815]  Allow us to be strong in time of war.
[01:36:39.235 --> 01:36:49.418]  This is going to strengthen the soft American underbelly, and Trump can end up one of the greatest presidents in American history if he can ride this tiger right down the line.
[01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:52.859]  Well said, my friend.
[01:36:52.879 --> 01:36:54.220]  Thank you so much for holding, Peter.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:54.720]  Thank you.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.321]  Okay, let's go to Dawson in California.
[01:36:58.341 --> 01:36:58.721]  You're on the air.
[01:37:00.083 --> 01:37:00.644]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:37:00.664 --> 01:37:01.184]  Good, sir.
[01:37:02.265 --> 01:37:02.605]  Hey, good.
[01:37:03.126 --> 01:37:10.212]  So, what I thought was kind of nerve-wracking was the fact that, you know, I was going to buy my first handgun within the past few days.
[01:37:10.272 --> 01:37:11.733]  My dad already has quite a few.
[01:37:12.233 --> 01:37:17.798]  So, I wasn't really too worried, but I was going to go buy my first one a couple weeks ago, and I decided to hold off on it.
[01:37:18.298 --> 01:37:20.880]  And then now, all the gun stores are closed.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.363]  They don't have any handguns left in California.
[01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:25.925]  It proves mostly just older models of handguns.
[01:37:28.372 --> 01:37:29.853]  Well, brother, that's okay.
[01:37:30.454 --> 01:37:37.939]  You know, I don't know how big a shooter you are, but a .357 Magnum six-shot revolver is an incredibly accurate firearm.
[01:37:37.959 --> 01:37:39.380]  It's, say, an 8-inch, 10-inch barrel.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.262]  You can shoot pretty accurately at 50 yards with that.
[01:37:42.903 --> 01:37:46.065]  And, you know, six shots, I mean, I'm all for high capacity.
[01:37:46.085 --> 01:37:46.525]  That's great.
[01:37:46.545 --> 01:37:53.630]  But let me tell you, I'm going for a gun at, you know, midnight, somebody breaking my house, .357 Magnum revolver.
[01:37:53.650 --> 01:37:54.671]  It's just going to get the job done.
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:57.981]  Awesome, yeah, definitely.
[01:37:58.001 --> 01:38:03.045]  I'm sure any handgun or any type of firearm you have in your house would be a good self-defense mechanism.
[01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:25.784]  What I'm mostly worried about is how, like, if they could cancel the background check, if they continue to be telling gun stores to stay closed rather than, you know, open within this time period, you know, I'm just not sure how long it's going to last, or if they'll keep it going for eight months and telling the gun stores that, you know, they'll have to stay closed because they're not a, what do you call it, a needed business to stay open.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.705]  And all the local gun stores are supposed to be closed for the next couple weeks, which I found that kind of interesting.
[01:38:33.927 --> 01:38:36.169]  It's all happening, and the big weapon is the depression.
[01:38:36.769 --> 01:38:37.870]  The big weapon is the depression.
[01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:38.931]  Thank you so much, Dawson.
[01:38:38.951 --> 01:38:39.492]  God bless you.
[01:38:39.752 --> 01:38:41.393]  The weapon you have is word of mouth.
[01:38:42.318 --> 01:38:42.938]  Thank you Alex.
[01:38:42.978 --> 01:38:44.559]  Trump needs to tell the media to shelter in place.
[01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:49.118]   stations you tune into and the streams at man.video and infowars.com and
[01:38:49.118 --> 01:38:54.498]   newswars.com. Okay we're going to go to Jim and then to our guest and then back
[01:38:54.498 --> 01:38:57.378]   to the calls. Jim in Texas thanks for holding you're on the air on this
[01:38:57.378 --> 01:39:01.938]   emergency commercial free Saturday transmission. Thank you Alex. Trump needs
[01:39:01.938 --> 01:39:06.059]   to tell the media to shelter in place. Here's the problem and the solution. The
[01:39:06.059 --> 01:39:10.898]  problem is President Trump is missing an opportunity.
[01:39:09.345 --> 01:39:25.250]  He has said no more than 10 people should assemble, yet in spite of telling the American people this is necessary, he's letting a mob of 50 to 100 demon-cracked news media into the White House to act as enemies of the American people and attack them every weekday on television.
[01:39:26.129 --> 01:39:36.936]  The solution is what he ought to do is to tell the media to shelter in place and submit all questions for him and the experts in writing and White House staffers can read the questions to him and the experts on the platform.
[01:39:37.596 --> 01:39:38.057]  What do you think?
[01:39:40.158 --> 01:39:47.343]  I think he shows how they're enemies the American people, how they try to panic people and you know since you mentioned that then I'll ask you what you think.
[01:39:47.383 --> 01:39:48.424]  Let's play this short clip.
[01:39:49.084 --> 01:39:49.644]  Clip two.
[01:39:49.704 --> 01:39:53.633]   Journalist asks What do you say to Americans?
[01:39:53.713 --> 01:39:59.435]  And they're obviously up there like Chicken Little, trying to scare people, and that goes into our next story, as much as they can.
[01:39:59.455 --> 01:40:05.158]  And again, Trump tried to say, hey, we've always had viruses and diseases, we'll deal with it, we're strong, we'll come together.
[01:40:05.638 --> 01:40:08.039]  They said, oh, you're gonna crash the market, oh, it's all your fault, people die.
[01:40:08.059 --> 01:40:08.900]  I said, okay, fine.
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.641]  But notice he's in the trap now, the deeper he gets, and damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[01:40:13.122 --> 01:40:17.524]  So we expose the hysteria, we expose the hype, and ask, what's really going on here?
[01:40:17.764 --> 01:40:18.244]  Here's the clue.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.167]  So what do you say to Americans who are scared though?
[01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:33.074]  I guess nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions, as you witnessed, who are scared right now.
[01:40:33.314 --> 01:40:36.377]  What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?
[01:40:37.118 --> 01:40:38.640]  I say that you're a terrible reporter.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.381]  That's what I say.
[01:40:40.822 --> 01:40:46.426]  I think it's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people.
[01:40:46.886 --> 01:40:50.209]  The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.
[01:40:50.809 --> 01:40:55.693]  And you're doing sensationalism and the same with NBC and Comcast.
[01:40:55.753 --> 01:40:58.675]  I don't call it Comcast, I call it Comcast.
[01:40:58.715 --> 01:41:00.016]  Let me just ask for whom you work.
[01:41:00.296 --> 01:41:01.257]  Let me just say something.
[01:41:02.077 --> 01:41:04.017]  That's really bad reporting.
[01:41:04.477 --> 01:41:07.318]  And you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism.
[01:41:07.758 --> 01:41:08.718]  Let's see if it works.
[01:41:09.238 --> 01:41:10.699]  It might, and it might not.
[01:41:11.259 --> 01:41:13.599]  I happen to feel good about it, but who knows?
[01:41:13.759 --> 01:41:14.799]  I've been right a lot.
[01:41:15.599 --> 01:41:16.440]  Let's see what happens.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:16.780]  John?
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.300]  Let me get back to the science and the logistics.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.560]  They're a shame.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.161]  The units that were ordered, are they for clinical trials?
[01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:24.121]  Those reporters are bought and paid for by globalists.
[01:41:24.141 --> 01:41:25.361]  That's why they attack the country.
[01:41:25.381 --> 01:41:25.921]  They undermine.
[01:41:25.941 --> 01:41:27.161]  They all supported Xi Jinping.
[01:41:27.562 --> 01:41:29.522]  Welding home doors, shooting women in the head.
[01:41:30.202 --> 01:41:31.965]  Trump tries to block flights from there, he's racist.
[01:41:32.246 --> 01:41:36.574]  There's not logic involved, they're just attacking the president because they want control of the government again.
[01:41:36.975 --> 01:41:38.238]  We only have partial control.
[01:41:38.538 --> 01:41:40.782]  So obviously they're stampeding this, they're driving this.
[01:41:41.263 --> 01:41:41.905]  What do you think, Jim?
[01:41:43.166 --> 01:41:45.027]  You're exactly right, but that's what shows it.
[01:41:45.047 --> 01:41:55.330]  They're all jammed in a room, no social distancing, elbows to elbows, screaming over each other, looking like a crazed mob, all in an effort to make him look bad at every turn.
[01:41:55.730 --> 01:42:01.312]  That's why he needs to send them home and do what they do when they want to shape the news at these town halls.
[01:42:01.332 --> 01:42:04.933]  They have to submit the questions in writing, then they'll pick one to be read.
[01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:10.435]  He should do that for the American people instead of letting those guys control the narrative and drive it on television.
[01:42:10.675 --> 01:42:12.535]  Alright, I hear you and I appreciate your call, Jim.
[01:42:12.695 --> 01:42:15.796]  I'll tell you what the President's doing, from an instinctive level.
[01:42:15.856 --> 01:42:16.736]  It's dialectic.
[01:42:17.416 --> 01:42:25.358]  He's up there, well-spoken, covering facts, dressed nice, and they're chomping and attacking and doing all this and no one's ever opposed him.
[01:42:25.758 --> 01:42:27.499]  He's bringing them in so it's a spectacle.
[01:42:28.099 --> 01:42:29.439]  And I'm gonna go with Trump's model.
[01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:33.940]  I mean, I think he knows people like WWE wrestling, that he's giving them what they want.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.651]   Now, We'll go back to your calls in about 20 minutes.
[01:42:36.671 --> 01:42:37.652]  I'm already late getting to our guest.
[01:42:37.692 --> 01:42:38.373]  I apologize.
[01:42:39.334 --> 01:42:47.160]  This is the type of guest I really like to get on that's informed, that's grassroots, that's discovering things, that's really illustrating interesting things.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:50.623]  We're going to play his report, a few minutes long, tell you where you can see it and go right to him.
[01:42:51.424 --> 01:42:52.425]  But I was already having him on.
[01:42:52.445 --> 01:42:53.946]  I contacted my producer this morning.
[01:42:53.966 --> 01:42:55.127]  I said, we got to do a special show today.
[01:42:55.547 --> 01:42:57.149]  I said, I'd like to get this fellow on at the end.
[01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:03.833]  Little did I know, he's made some big movies that I was aware of, award-winning top movies that are humanitarian.
[01:43:03.854 --> 01:43:04.914]  I was like, I know these movies.
[01:43:04.974 --> 01:43:05.635]  I saw that movie.
[01:43:05.675 --> 01:43:07.576]  I'm not even a big movie buff, as you know.
[01:43:07.596 --> 01:43:11.079]  But his YouTube's, you know, just a regular place, kind of like a scrapbook.
[01:43:11.119 --> 01:43:11.699]  He posts stuff.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.322]  And I was watching it because my producer sent it to me, and it's going viral.
[01:43:16.062 --> 01:43:21.947]  And it's the same thing my crew kept telling me, is that they, a couple of them were coughing, so they wanted to go test it.
[01:43:21.967 --> 01:43:23.508]  They go there, they go, we're not testing people.
[01:43:23.788 --> 01:43:24.569]  There's nobody there.
[01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:27.351]  But then you'd see on the news claiming it's all overwhelmed.
[01:43:28.646 --> 01:43:34.271]  Then I saw this article and I was really glad today that I had already set this guest up.
[01:43:34.591 --> 01:43:34.751]  L.A.
[01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:39.995]  County gives up on coronavirus.
[01:43:40.916 --> 01:43:45.300]  They give up on containing coronavirus, tells doctors to skip testing of some patients.
[01:43:46.661 --> 01:43:48.341]  So why is the LA Times reporting that?
[01:43:48.381 --> 01:43:48.922]  Here's the video.
[01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.122]  InfoWars.com.
[01:43:50.542 --> 01:43:50.882]  Video.
[01:43:50.922 --> 01:43:54.323]  Nobody getting tested for coronavirus despite claims of long lines.
[01:43:54.603 --> 01:44:03.986]  So let's play his report and then go to Jason Jones of MovieToMovement.com, TheGreatCampaign.org, and the Jason Jones Show.
[01:44:04.006 --> 01:44:09.127]  We'll go to him in a moment, but let's go to his report from his YouTube channel that he just put together.
[01:44:09.167 --> 01:44:09.467]  Here it is.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:16.463]  She's the CEO of Urgent Care and she assaulted me.
[01:44:17.304 --> 01:44:18.065]  And it's on video.
[01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:20.067]  That caught you lying to the people of Hawaii.
[01:44:20.648 --> 01:44:21.589]  Here's my question, guys.
[01:44:23.171 --> 01:44:23.771]  What's the lie?
[01:44:23.811 --> 01:44:24.512]  What's the game here?
[01:44:24.652 --> 01:44:25.513]  You're smart people.
[01:44:26.113 --> 01:44:28.915]  Why are they whipping us into a panic?
[01:44:29.495 --> 01:44:33.138]  Why are they lying about massive lines of people at testing centers?
[01:44:33.878 --> 01:44:38.161]  Why are they turning away the trickle of folks that show up to be tested?
[01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:45.145]  Urgent Care Hawaii says its drive-up service was deluged by requests for coronavirus tests, especially yesterday.
[01:44:44.965 --> 01:44:49.965]  [crickets chirping]
[01:44:49.965 --> 01:44:51.965]  For radio listeners, there's no one there.
[01:44:51.965 --> 01:44:57.965]  [crickets chirping]
[01:44:57.965 --> 01:44:59.965]  What is the game?
[01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:03.729]  Because for the life of me, I cannot figure it out.
[01:45:04.509 --> 01:45:10.333]  Night after night being told there are these long lines of people being managed at the Urgent Care, that they're being overwhelmed.
[01:45:10.733 --> 01:45:12.454]  Some waiting as long as four hours.
[01:45:12.674 --> 01:45:21.139]  Actually, the president or CEO of Urgent Care, while I was in front of the place, was telling me, we're doing the best we can managing these massive lines.
[01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:22.780]  I'm like, I'm here, lady.
[01:45:24.198 --> 01:45:25.179]  And there's no lines.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.168]  We were overwhelmed yesterday with the response to people wanting testing.
[01:45:31.348 --> 01:45:34.012]  So my FaceTime lives have gotten the attention.
[01:45:34.032 --> 01:45:35.273]  Finally hit pause, folks.
[01:45:36.547 --> 01:45:43.451]  This guy's a major filmmaker, war-winning filmmaker, but he's won international awards, but he's shooting this himself.
[01:45:43.952 --> 01:45:46.633]  He's showing on the news, though, she says it's overwhelmed.
[01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:50.316]  It shows the parking lot over her shoulder in the mirror, same parking lot he comes to the next day.
[01:45:50.696 --> 01:45:55.279]  There's like two cars in the giant parking lot, because everybody's not there, and then there's no one inside.
[01:45:55.799 --> 01:46:00.242]  So again, he's not like at another location or on a weekend, and he's lying, it's closed.
[01:46:00.302 --> 01:46:01.603]  No, he's there while it's open.
[01:46:01.823 --> 01:46:02.563]  You're about to see that.
[01:46:02.644 --> 01:46:03.004]  Here it is.
[01:46:04.611 --> 01:46:06.172]  Well, and they were on my side.
[01:46:06.512 --> 01:46:07.652]  They were on my side.
[01:46:08.132 --> 01:46:09.173]  They thought it was ridiculous.
[01:46:09.673 --> 01:46:17.315]  He escalated and, um, apparently, you know, he, um, threatened our employees.
[01:46:17.596 --> 01:46:18.636]  By the way, I like these guys.
[01:46:18.656 --> 01:46:19.296]  They're good guys.
[01:46:19.756 --> 01:46:22.537]  Those poor girls in there making $15 an hour, I'm sure they're good women.
[01:46:22.637 --> 01:46:23.698]  And I don't blame this poor woman.
[01:46:23.738 --> 01:46:27.419]  Her CEO should be in prison for taking our money and lying about lines.
[01:46:28.079 --> 01:46:30.461]  There are no lines.
[01:46:30.861 --> 01:46:33.562]  And we had to, you know, ask for help.
[01:46:34.123 --> 01:46:40.946]  So we did call security and the police came and helped to let us know that he needed to leave.
[01:46:40.966 --> 01:46:46.349]  I'm going to ask the officers how big the line is so we can get them to verify there is no line.
[01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:47.530]  How you doing, officer?
[01:46:48.731 --> 01:46:54.034]  I just want to know why Urgent Care doesn't want me to document they're lying on the news about being overwhelmed with lines.
[01:46:54.858 --> 01:46:54.918]  Wow!
[01:46:54.738 --> 01:46:56.217]  and testing all these people.
[01:46:56.217 --> 01:46:57.577]  They're taking state money.
[01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.978]  And they're not testing anyone.
[01:46:59.978 --> 01:47:01.778]  I've been watching this.
[01:47:01.778 --> 01:47:04.057]   Everyone that comes to be tested, they send away.
[01:47:04.057 --> 01:47:05.458]  Am I breaking any laws?
[01:47:05.458 --> 01:47:09.097]  They're breaking some laws.
[01:47:09.097 --> 01:47:11.254]   What they're saying They're taking our money.
[01:47:11.634 --> 01:47:12.695]  Look at that line, officer.
[01:47:13.055 --> 01:47:16.577]  You see that line?
[01:47:16.617 --> 01:47:20.579]  For sitting in there, documenting that they're not testing anyone?
[01:47:20.599 --> 01:47:20.999]  Yeah, I know.
[01:47:21.059 --> 01:47:22.220]  Are you the CEO?
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.980]  Did I talk to you yesterday?
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:24.300]  Okay.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.000]  And then the other way is a better problem.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.500]  Yeah, I know.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.000]  Are you the CEO?
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.500]  Are you... Did I talk to you yesterday?
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:31.000]  I told you.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.699]   So are these the overwhelming lines that you guys have been lying to?
[01:47:33.699 --> 01:47:35.199]  Pause. Back in a few seconds, we'll get our guest.
[01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:39.000]   For radio listeners, and a lot of stations are carrying this right now,
[01:47:40.171 --> 01:47:41.432]  He'll tell you the island, all the details.
[01:47:42.292 --> 01:47:45.014]  He's there, I guess, the day of them saying their overwhelming lines.
[01:47:45.034 --> 01:47:45.935]  He's there.
[01:47:46.155 --> 01:47:46.935]  There's no one there.
[01:47:47.136 --> 01:47:47.836]  There's no one there.
[01:47:47.856 --> 01:47:56.182]  There's a couple cars in the parking lot, and the woman calls the police on him, and then she ends up attacking him when he's at a parking lot that's a public space.
[01:47:56.822 --> 01:47:59.304]  So again, this, and we're seeing this everywhere.
[01:48:00.105 --> 01:48:01.005]  We're seeing this everywhere.
[01:48:01.045 --> 01:48:01.546]  Let's continue.
[01:48:04.429 --> 01:48:07.751]  So are these the overwhelming lines that you guys have been lying to the people of Hawaii about?
[01:48:09.651 --> 01:48:10.492]  Are these the overwhelming lines?
[01:48:10.512 --> 01:48:11.372]  Do you see a line there?
[01:48:13.113 --> 01:48:13.713]  What's your name?
[01:48:15.854 --> 01:48:21.557]  By the way, I have a lot more followers than you.
[01:48:21.617 --> 01:48:23.378]  I don't have any followers.
[01:48:23.898 --> 01:48:24.198]  Well good.
[01:48:24.278 --> 01:48:28.720]  I'm a journalist and this is going to be a column and it's going to be read nationally.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:29.761]  That's great.
[01:48:29.781 --> 01:48:36.211]   About how you're lying that there are massive lines You tested 25 people here yesterday?
[01:48:37.271 --> 01:48:37.831]  You said that.
[01:48:38.271 --> 01:48:41.912]  You didn't test 25 people?
[01:48:42.192 --> 01:48:44.092]  No, I didn't.
[01:48:44.332 --> 01:48:45.692]  No, I didn't.
[01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:46.733]  I got nobody going in.
[01:48:47.593 --> 01:48:52.754]  Officer, why can't I press charges for assault?
[01:48:54.014 --> 01:48:55.574]  Are you the CEO of Urgent Care?
[01:48:56.034 --> 01:48:59.155]  Well, you must be upset that you just assaulted me.
[01:49:01.907 --> 01:49:03.968]  She's the CEO of Urgent Care and she assaulted me.
[01:49:04.768 --> 01:49:05.649]  And it's on video.
[01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:12.952]  Thank you for proving my point that I caught you lying to the people of Hawaii.
[01:49:12.992 --> 01:49:13.733]  She grabbed my hand.
[01:49:14.173 --> 01:49:15.113]  She tried to steal my phone.
[01:49:15.353 --> 01:49:16.014]  They're going on the news.
[01:49:16.054 --> 01:49:19.035]  They just had a press conference talking about overwhelming lines in Kapolei.
[01:49:19.715 --> 01:49:20.236]  Thank you.
[01:49:22.777 --> 01:49:24.377]  Now I know we hit a nerve.
[01:49:26.038 --> 01:49:28.039]  I really don't know how I can outpress charges for that.
[01:49:28.059 --> 01:49:29.560]  I mean, I got a videotape.
[01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:35.691]  You know, I haven't recorded a single person going in there.
[01:49:36.051 --> 01:49:36.832]  I wouldn't do that.
[01:49:37.152 --> 01:49:40.634]  What I have recorded is a table with nobody there for hours.
[01:49:41.354 --> 01:49:42.335]  And nobody coming up.
[01:49:43.015 --> 01:49:44.716]  And what's your point?
[01:49:44.776 --> 01:49:49.459]  My point is, why are you on the news saying you're overwhelmed with people coming to be tested?
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  When?
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:59.919]   We have done that and there are regional testing centers open all over the state.
[01:49:59.919 --> 01:50:03.480]  You said in Kapolei you did 25 tests yesterday.
[01:50:03.489 --> 01:50:05.190]  It's in Hawaii News now.
[01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:05.810]  That's a lie.
[01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:11.413]  And the time this was all taking place, nobody, not one person.
[01:50:11.853 --> 01:50:20.118]  So I want to know why they are on the news saying that the Kapolei location is being overwhelmed with people coming for tests.
[01:50:20.898 --> 01:50:22.659]  What is the game?
[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:25.621]  That's not how I want to spend my Saturday.
[01:50:27.864 --> 01:50:29.004]  That's the Jason Jones Show.
[01:50:29.065 --> 01:50:29.985]  I'm going to be watching that.
[01:50:30.445 --> 01:50:32.926]  And again, I just saw him this morning and I said, yeah, let's get him on.
[01:50:32.946 --> 01:50:40.449]  And then I looked him up and said, well, I know the movie that won the People's Choice Awards 2006, Bella.
[01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:45.191]  And I know these other films that won the NAACP Image Awards 2010.
[01:50:46.292 --> 01:50:47.572]  I mean, he's done a lot of big movies.
[01:50:47.612 --> 01:50:49.213]  I'm not going to read them all here or go over it.
[01:50:49.913 --> 01:50:51.214]  Movietomovement.com.
[01:50:51.894 --> 01:51:01.824]  Just tell folks what island you're on, the background, what made you think, hey, something's going on, and what you think's really going on, because this is real grassroots investigative journalism you're talking about.
[01:51:01.844 --> 01:51:08.490]  Your full video is on Infowars.com for radio listeners that were listening to this and want to get the full, full import of this.
[01:51:09.131 --> 01:51:11.052]  She definitely was acting pretty damn guilty.
[01:51:11.092 --> 01:51:12.774]  What in the hell's going on, Mr. Jones?
[01:51:14.946 --> 01:51:18.847]  Well Alex, it's a real honor to be on your show and I have to say, I don't know what was going on.
[01:51:19.027 --> 01:51:21.687]  I happened to, I just got back from the mainland.
[01:51:21.747 --> 01:51:24.488]  I live on Oahu, on the west side of Oahu in Kapolei.
[01:51:25.268 --> 01:51:30.429]  And I was in nine cities in 14 days promoting an upcoming movie that's going to be in theaters in September.
[01:51:31.209 --> 01:51:38.791]  And on my trip, a friend called me and said, Jason, the day before I met with you, I spent an entire day with someone who just tested positive.
[01:51:39.697 --> 01:51:46.600]  Uh, for COVID-19 and I have an elderly mother-in-law and I have an elderly and her her brother who lives with who are staying with us.
[01:51:47.361 --> 01:51:48.501]  So I thought it would be prudent.
[01:51:48.721 --> 01:51:50.102]  I had a sore throat and a cough.
[01:51:50.934 --> 01:51:53.054]  And so I thought it would be prudent to get tested.
[01:51:53.535 --> 01:51:57.976]  So I quarantined myself for 24 hours until that facility opened.
[01:51:58.416 --> 01:51:59.836]  My wife actually called ahead.
[01:52:00.276 --> 01:52:02.857]  She called our doctor who said, go to the drive-thru clinic.
[01:52:03.337 --> 01:52:06.237]  My wife called Urgent Care, they said to come on down.
[01:52:06.777 --> 01:52:09.838]  So I left first thing in the morning and I like to read.
[01:52:09.898 --> 01:52:11.838]  I brought my reading glasses, you can see there.
[01:52:12.399 --> 01:52:16.479]  And I had a book on the first day and I thought I'm gonna be in my car reading for hours.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:19.300]  I got there and there was nobody there.
[01:52:20.177 --> 01:52:21.738]  Actually, I have seven children, Alex.
[01:52:21.938 --> 01:52:23.138]  We're at that urgent care a lot.
[01:52:23.158 --> 01:52:24.099]  We do a lot of sports.
[01:52:24.179 --> 01:52:25.079]  There's a lot of injuries.
[01:52:26.279 --> 01:52:28.120]  I've never seen that urgent care so empty.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:38.204]  And the reason it was empty was because if your son sprained his ankle playing tennis, do you want to go to a place that has hordes of people that think they have COVID-19?
[01:52:38.624 --> 01:52:40.545]  No, you don't go to a COVID testing facility.
[01:52:41.625 --> 01:52:42.265]  No, you don't.
[01:52:42.746 --> 01:52:43.766]  So there was nobody there.
[01:52:43.786 --> 01:52:45.507]  I've never seen it that abandoned.
[01:52:46.007 --> 01:52:47.488]  So I thought, this is going to be great.
[01:52:47.528 --> 01:52:48.568]  I'm going to get this test.
[01:52:48.648 --> 01:52:49.368]  It's going to be done.
[01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:52.430]  I approached, and I said, you know, I have a cough.
[01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:53.390]  I have a sore throat.
[01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:58.392]  I've been in nine cities in 14 days, and I may have been exposed.
[01:52:58.793 --> 01:53:01.514]  And I was actually more concerned about my events.
[01:53:01.574 --> 01:53:02.314]  I just didn't event.
[01:53:02.334 --> 01:53:03.455]  You want to protect your community.
[01:53:03.475 --> 01:53:04.815]  You want to protect your family.
[01:53:04.835 --> 01:53:05.976]  You shook all these hands.
[01:53:06.256 --> 01:53:07.476]  You promote another one of your movies.
[01:53:08.057 --> 01:53:10.198]  And then what happened next?
[01:53:11.716 --> 01:53:18.877]  You're a prime suspect to have it and you go to the place they say on the news is overwhelmed and you go there and it's crickets.
[01:53:20.014 --> 01:53:22.915]  Well, the mistake I made, Alex, is I told him I had a sore throat.
[01:53:22.955 --> 01:53:24.516]  I told him I may have been exposed.
[01:53:24.556 --> 01:53:25.697]  I told him I had been traveling.
[01:53:25.737 --> 01:53:26.777]  That all met the criteria.
[01:53:27.117 --> 01:53:29.859]  What I didn't bring was my Toronto Film Festival trophy.
[01:53:30.099 --> 01:53:33.861]  I think if I'd have walked up with that, you know, look, I won the Toronto International Film Festival.
[01:53:33.881 --> 01:53:35.001]  I have an IMDb page.
[01:53:35.442 --> 01:53:36.402]  I might have gotten tested.
[01:53:36.702 --> 01:53:42.425]  Where I really got angry is a woman approached, elderly and obese, and she looked like death.
[01:53:43.027 --> 01:53:44.028]  They didn't take her name.
[01:53:44.509 --> 01:53:45.650]  They asked her her symptoms.
[01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:48.873]  She said she had a 99.8 and was referred by her doctor.
[01:53:49.114 --> 01:53:50.615]  But they did not take her temperature.
[01:53:50.895 --> 01:53:52.297]  They just sent her away.
[01:53:52.577 --> 01:53:54.579]  They gave her a piece of paper and said call this number.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.540]  I did that.
[01:53:55.821 --> 01:53:57.703]  The number said self-quarantine for 14 days.
[01:53:57.723 --> 01:54:01.146]  So why are they on the news advertising as they're the place to go?
[01:54:01.166 --> 01:54:02.067]  We've got long lines.
[01:54:02.087 --> 01:54:03.409]  You go there and there's nothing happening.
[01:54:03.749 --> 01:54:06.571]  Something, I mean, we're hearing, we're getting calls of this everywhere.
[01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:09.073]  And like a week ago, I told the crew, stop being paranoid.
[01:54:09.093 --> 01:54:10.714]  They're not fake testing, come on.
[01:54:11.074 --> 01:54:19.800]  But now it's like, what in the world is, and the CDC's put thousands in five, six weeks ago, and it supposedly had it and turned them loose.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:21.862]  And then, but then we've all got to stay in our houses.
[01:54:22.282 --> 01:54:22.742]  Keep going.
[01:54:23.983 --> 01:54:29.347]  Well, and then when they turned away this elderly woman, I was getting ready to leave to go to my doctor, which I did.
[01:54:29.387 --> 01:54:33.330]  I went to my doctor and I got tested and he sent it off to Texas and I'm negative.
[01:54:33.996 --> 01:54:38.378]  But when they sent away an elderly woman who's obese, who's sick, I said, I'm going to stick around.
[01:54:38.398 --> 01:54:42.101]  And I stuck around for three and a half hours that first day, the day they were overwhelmed.
[01:54:42.441 --> 01:54:45.262]  I saw nine patients approach, all nine turned away.
[01:54:45.282 --> 01:54:46.443]  They didn't get their names.
[01:54:46.903 --> 01:54:48.224]  They didn't take their temperature.
[01:54:48.931 --> 01:54:53.492]  When I said I didn't have a fever, I went to my doctor to get tested, and in fact, I did have a slight fever.
[01:54:53.852 --> 01:54:57.913]  And my, the nurse at my doctor's office was shocked that they weren't taking vitals.
[01:54:58.173 --> 01:55:00.933]  But sir, here's the thing, I know you don't know what's happening, but I'm getting a good idea.
[01:55:01.713 --> 01:55:03.114]  One of our crew members thought he might have it.
[01:55:03.154 --> 01:55:05.674]  They went, no one was being tested, and they wouldn't test him.
[01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:09.435]  And I know there were sick people going there, and I'm getting, I'm hearing this from everybody.
[01:55:09.855 --> 01:55:14.055]  So, why are they on the news saying they're overwhelmed, it's terrible, but they won't do tests?
[01:55:14.135 --> 01:55:15.576]  Someone's telling them to do this.
[01:55:15.816 --> 01:55:16.796]  Who's running this?
[01:55:18.598 --> 01:55:24.700]  Well, so then I called my member of Congress, Tulsi Gabbard, who's a friend of mine, and I texted her my card.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.441]  So she scratched out my personal information and tweeted at our governor.
[01:55:28.501 --> 01:55:31.422]  So I have a Democrat member of Congress tweeting at our Democrat governor.
[01:55:31.802 --> 01:55:35.043]  I'm a Republican, but she tweets out at him, what's the deal?
[01:55:35.184 --> 01:55:35.984]  What's going on?
[01:55:36.204 --> 01:55:36.864]  My friend is there.
[01:55:36.904 --> 01:55:39.345]  He's trying to get tested and he can't get tested.
[01:55:39.905 --> 01:55:40.746]  It's unbelievable.
[01:55:40.786 --> 01:55:44.308]  So I sent friends of mine to other locations to take pictures and to film.
[01:55:44.728 --> 01:55:46.769]  My one friend said, Jason, it looks like a movie set.
[01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:49.210]  I've since gotten pictures from people that were there all week.
[01:55:49.791 --> 01:55:50.931]  One day somebody went there.
[01:55:51.432 --> 01:55:52.032]  They were sick.
[01:55:52.372 --> 01:55:54.533]  It was actually closed in the middle of the day.
[01:55:55.434 --> 01:55:57.115]  Everything was boarded up and closed.
[01:55:57.355 --> 01:56:00.457]  So it's there to make sure you go there and don't go to a real doctor.
[01:56:00.737 --> 01:56:01.097]  Probably.
[01:56:02.543 --> 01:56:24.906]   You know I honestly the reason I made that video and I didn't know it was gonna go viral a friend of mine said let me snip it together and put it on YouTube I put it on a channel I never even use that's separate from my movies and next thing you know it's going around the world and then people are emailing me that this is happening all over the country and I really you know people are saying this is They're trying to make money off of this crisis.
[01:56:24.966 --> 01:56:26.047]  And I said, that's impossible.
[01:56:26.067 --> 01:56:31.652]  But now we see members of Congress may have been trying to profit off this crisis.
[01:56:31.832 --> 01:56:34.355]  Alex, you know, the one guy that would know is you.
[01:56:34.935 --> 01:56:38.779]  And so, actually, you're one of the first places I went to look.
[01:56:39.219 --> 01:56:42.242]   And I was trying, I still Can't outwrap my mind around it.
[01:56:42.262 --> 01:56:43.163]  Mr. Jones, I'm like you.
[01:56:43.263 --> 01:56:45.464]  I'm not sure, but it's my crew saying it.
[01:56:45.524 --> 01:56:47.386]  We're getting calls saying they won't test me.
[01:56:48.987 --> 01:56:50.268]  And they're going, oh, we don't have the kits.
[01:56:50.308 --> 01:56:51.349]  No, they have the kits now.
[01:56:51.429 --> 01:56:53.010]  So I don't think this lady's trying to profit.
[01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:55.772]  How does she profit off not getting paid for the test?
[01:56:56.653 --> 01:56:59.395]  I think they've been told, you just don't do the test.
[01:57:00.919 --> 01:57:06.303]  Well, what's interesting is, after my video came out, there seemed to be a move to kind of dox and destroy me.
[01:57:06.624 --> 01:57:13.389]  But then, two tourists who went to Urgent Care to get tested, weren't, went home to Colorado, were tested and were positive.
[01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:18.293]  As soon as that was discovered, all the Urgent Care testing centers were shut down.
[01:57:20.945 --> 01:57:27.710]  Exactly, because if you look at the early response, Fauci and the NIH and CDC told Trump it's no problem, it's no big deal.
[01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:29.010]  He went out and said that.
[01:57:29.351 --> 01:57:39.077]  Now they're setting him up, because either the China thing's a hoax, or it's real, and now Trump's people are being told it's not a problem, and that China's done great.
[01:57:39.117 --> 01:57:40.798]  So Trump goes, you've done great, Xi Jinping.
[01:57:40.998 --> 01:57:41.579]  Try to be nice.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.942]  Then they start blaming Trump right away.
[01:57:44.962 --> 01:57:46.964]  They go, oh, they're going to set him up for a bad response.
[01:57:47.305 --> 01:57:51.629]  And it looks like they're trying to incubate it here, bringing in thousands right out of China, not testing them.
[01:57:51.929 --> 01:57:54.372]  And the NIH dumping them out in Texas, all over the country.
[01:57:54.392 --> 01:57:56.414]  I mean, because the NIH knows what they're doing.
[01:57:56.814 --> 01:57:59.257]  And then now they don't want folks being tested.
[01:57:59.277 --> 01:58:00.017]  They send them away.
[01:58:01.283 --> 01:58:19.850]  It sounds like they want it to be as bad as they possibly can, or they know people really aren't positive, and they want to make it look like it's worse, but it actually looks like it probably is bad, because other people are testing positive at real clinics and real doctor's offices, and so they're wanting to incubate it as much as possible, not the lady at the place.
[01:58:20.191 --> 01:58:27.213]  She's being told by whatever PR firm or group is coordinating this notice with the media that went out and covered her to do it, because it's not just this one place.
[01:58:27.273 --> 01:58:30.955]  As you said, you're getting contacted, I'm getting contacted with people saying the same stories.
[01:58:31.195 --> 01:58:31.975]  Can you speak to that?
[01:58:33.356 --> 01:58:34.396]  Well, here's what I would say.
[01:58:34.436 --> 01:58:44.200]  Hawaii, if this story is going to break wide open, if she was being told this, and it's possible, but Hawaii will be, as strange as it might sound to your audience, Hawaii is a state that's a family.
[01:58:44.855 --> 01:58:46.696]  We don't have a lot of partisan division.
[01:58:46.856 --> 01:58:47.477]  We're family.
[01:58:47.517 --> 01:58:48.117]  We're an island.
[01:58:48.257 --> 01:58:48.917]  We know each other.
[01:58:48.937 --> 01:58:49.598]  We love each other.
[01:58:49.638 --> 01:58:50.818]  Republicans, Democrats.
[01:58:50.878 --> 01:58:51.779]  I know Mazie Hirono.
[01:58:51.859 --> 01:58:52.759]  I know Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:58:52.819 --> 01:58:57.242]  And I'm a Republican who speaks nationally as a Republican.
[01:58:57.522 --> 01:59:00.424]  We're a family and we all know each other.
[01:59:00.444 --> 01:59:01.404]  We're all intermarried.
[01:59:01.424 --> 01:59:02.505]  We're a small community.
[01:59:02.985 --> 01:59:08.470]  So, if there's any kind of shenanigans, I expect that the state of Hawaii is where it will erupt.
[01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:12.613]  In fact, you even see our Lieutenant Governor openly combating our Governor.
[01:59:12.653 --> 01:59:16.897]  You have a Lieutenant Governor, Josh Green, challenging our Governor's response.
[01:59:17.197 --> 01:59:20.880]  You have Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who takes down the CIA.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.121]  She's not afraid of Governor Ige.
[01:59:22.481 --> 01:59:23.902]  She's challenging Governor Ige.
[01:59:24.403 --> 01:59:27.806]  So, look to Hawaii for a place for the truth to come out.
[01:59:28.166 --> 01:59:30.348]  Again, Alex, I'm not Alex Jones.
[01:59:31.088 --> 01:59:36.371]  I'm a filmmaker, I'm just a guy that runs a non-profit that went to go get tested to be responsible.
[01:59:36.711 --> 01:59:39.232]  I made this video for my friends, my family, and my neighbors.
[01:59:39.913 --> 01:59:43.935]  But then it struck a nerve with people who were seeing this happen all across the country.
[01:59:43.955 --> 01:59:51.178]  By the way, it was the Senate Republican leader that exposed the whole CIA situation during the Ronald Reagan deal and all that.
[01:59:51.218 --> 01:59:53.560]  So you're right, a lot of independent stuff does come out of a lie.
[01:59:54.780 --> 02:00:00.622]  Just to go back to what you were saying, Tulsi Gabbard, she sent out this tweet for radio listeners.
[02:00:00.762 --> 02:00:01.943]  I know TV viewers have already seen it.
[02:00:01.983 --> 02:00:02.763]  My friend is sick.
[02:00:02.803 --> 02:00:06.425]  He had contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
[02:00:06.805 --> 02:00:10.706]  He's in Urgent Care, Hawaii to get tested and was rejected, saying he doesn't meet the criteria.
[02:00:11.306 --> 02:00:12.487]  It's in the hour.
[02:00:12.527 --> 02:00:13.007]  He's been there.
[02:00:13.027 --> 02:00:14.688]  There are other sick people getting turned away.
[02:00:15.148 --> 02:00:17.929]  Governor, Attorney General, Inspector General.
[02:00:18.369 --> 02:00:21.390]  And then here's the actual form you were given.
[02:00:23.351 --> 02:00:24.652]  So this is just incredible.
[02:00:24.732 --> 02:00:40.999]  The boom operator, John, who ought to be a talk show host, he's smarter than I am, Herr Wolf over there, he was saying that, no, he's been saying this for like a month, they want to hype up that it's a high death rate, so that's why they won't do testing everywhere, and that's why they're sending people away, because they know it's not super deadly.
[02:00:41.199 --> 02:00:49.263]  They only want to count the deaths to send that number up to create maximum panic, and that's what the deep state's been doing so far, is trying to hype the most panic they can.
[02:00:49.303 --> 02:00:49.763]  What do you think?
[02:00:50.984 --> 02:00:57.007]  Well, you know, Alex, it's a privilege to be on your show because I know the President pays attention to your show.
[02:00:57.327 --> 02:00:59.108]  So let me tell you the three things I know.
[02:00:59.668 --> 02:01:00.828]  I know that there's a God.
[02:01:00.928 --> 02:01:04.790]  I know that we're made in His image and likeness and have an incomparable dignity, beauty, and worth.
[02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:10.433]  And I know that we're the only country founded on that vision of the human person that's in our Declaration of Independence.
[02:01:10.913 --> 02:01:15.195]  But Abraham Lincoln said that the Constitution is just a frame.
[02:01:15.874 --> 02:01:18.056]  The Declaration Principle is the work of art.
[02:01:18.577 --> 02:01:23.602]  And so I would say to the President of the United States and to our political leaders, keep it constitutional.
[02:01:24.062 --> 02:01:29.968]  When you violate the Constitution, what is left, what is next, is an abuse of the human person.
[02:01:30.865 --> 02:01:36.929]  So as a Christian man, my commitment is to my neighbor to make sure our vulnerable are protected.
[02:01:37.369 --> 02:01:41.832]  There is no better way to protect our vulnerable than to preserve the Constitution.
[02:01:42.172 --> 02:01:45.754]  With my work, I've had tea with Al-Qaeda in Sudan.
[02:01:46.094 --> 02:01:49.216]  I've been with the Peshmerga as they fought ISIS a mile away.
[02:01:49.917 --> 02:01:57.581]  And I've always known that what is different for my children and the children I see in these tragic places is our Constitution.
[02:01:58.182 --> 02:02:08.674]   So what I am most concerned about And Alex, if you took the lead in just challenging us to keep the response constitutional, there is no excuse to violate the Constitution.
[02:02:08.714 --> 02:02:17.042]  There is no virus or no foreign enemy that is more dangerous than we as Americans choosing to set our Constitution aside for any reason.
[02:02:17.202 --> 02:02:18.843]  Well, Mr. Jones, I know you're on a talk show.
[02:02:18.903 --> 02:02:19.464]  I just learned about it.
[02:02:19.484 --> 02:02:20.324]  I already know all your movies.
[02:02:20.644 --> 02:02:28.149]  Anytime you want to host an hour of the show or anything, I'd look for you to come and talk about your principles, because I read, you know, your declaration on your site of what you stand for.
[02:02:28.169 --> 02:02:30.291]  And I'm totally, absolutely with what you're saying.
[02:02:30.311 --> 02:02:31.752]  They're telling us we're ugly, we're bad.
[02:02:32.172 --> 02:02:33.613]  No, we're made in the image of God.
[02:02:33.653 --> 02:02:34.253]  We're amazing.
[02:02:34.293 --> 02:02:38.216]  And realizing that, the connection to God is how we're going to pull ourselves up out of this to the next level.
[02:02:38.256 --> 02:02:40.377]  And this whole thing is just crazy.
[02:02:40.398 --> 02:02:44.000]  So if you'd like to try to get a message to Trump, I know that a lot of folks in the White House do watch.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.281]  He sees clips occasionally.
[02:02:45.581 --> 02:02:46.842]  He calls, you know, every once in a while.
[02:02:47.922 --> 02:02:49.183]  The White House does pay attention.
[02:02:49.203 --> 02:02:50.624]  The President overall agrees with us.
[02:02:50.924 --> 02:02:52.265]  What is your message to Trump here?
[02:02:52.325 --> 02:02:54.366]  What do you think about what's unfolding?
[02:02:55.647 --> 02:03:05.393]  You know, if the President just came out and said that our response will be constitutional, that our response will put the dignity of a human person first.
[02:03:05.773 --> 02:03:07.174]  Look, we look at what's happening in China.
[02:03:07.194 --> 02:03:08.355]  It'll be an American response.
[02:03:08.415 --> 02:03:10.336]  In America, we respond in an American way.
[02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:13.059]  That's right, an American response.
[02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:24.184]  And at the same time as we're preserving and protecting the vulnerable here, by protecting the Constitution, we look to China that is running a genocide that hasn't been seen since the Holocaust against the Uyghur.
[02:03:25.045 --> 02:03:38.912]  And my big concern is, as the whole world is fighting their own battle, whatever this battle is, and whoever it's against or whatever it's against, that China has been ramping up their brutal genocide with three million Uyghur in concentration camps.
[02:03:39.822 --> 02:03:43.065]  And so this is my concern for the vulnerable here at home.
[02:03:43.526 --> 02:03:55.197]  Here in Hawaii, we've started something called the Kapuna Project, where families like mine that have stockpiled and prepared for tragedies like this, we're committing to tie 10% of what we have to the community.
[02:03:55.577 --> 02:04:01.643]  My family is already running, doing errands and chores for the elderly and single mothers and others in the community that need help.
[02:04:02.263 --> 02:04:18.708]  And so we can defeat whatever this is by just remembering there's a God, there's a law above the gods of men, there's a law above the YouTube censors, and that every human being has an inviolable dignity, that you can't go anywhere in the universe to find anything more precious than Nancy Pelosi.
[02:04:18.748 --> 02:04:19.948]  She's made in the image of God.
[02:04:20.795 --> 02:04:28.604]  And if we always remember that every human being is made in the image of God and our response recognizes that, which our constitution that we've been given protects, we're good.
[02:04:29.105 --> 02:04:32.769]  I just, if I heard the president come out and say this, we're going to keep it constitutional.
[02:04:33.533 --> 02:04:42.918]  I think so many people would be comforted because that's my great concern and that would unite America because that's our fear that we're going to see our Constitution thrown in the trash.
[02:04:43.118 --> 02:04:45.480]  Oh, this is the greatest assault, the greatest assault ever.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.082]  Well, Jason Jones, we've got the weekday show coming up this week.
[02:04:49.162 --> 02:04:52.444]  Please get with my producer and I won't make you hold for 20 minutes this time.
[02:04:52.464 --> 02:04:53.104]  I won't be behind.
[02:04:53.404 --> 02:04:54.925]  Please come on with us a half hour or so.
[02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:55.665]  Give us an update.
[02:04:55.685 --> 02:04:59.848]   And look, I was out at Zilker Park today and Probably shook 30-40 hands.
[02:04:59.868 --> 02:05:01.088]  It wasn't as busy as usual.
[02:05:01.148 --> 02:05:02.429]  Most of the liberals had woken up.
[02:05:02.449 --> 02:05:03.770]  They said, oh, you're right.
[02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:04.630]  People are really waking up.
[02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:07.692]  But one lady came up and screamed at me and called me a bad person and all this.
[02:05:07.752 --> 02:05:09.253]  And I kind of argued with her.
[02:05:09.273 --> 02:05:10.634]  And after a while, we shook hands.
[02:05:11.594 --> 02:05:13.195]  Her husband said, you better watch out at first.
[02:05:13.255 --> 02:05:14.496]  I'm like, hey, dude, she's in my face.
[02:05:14.556 --> 02:05:15.976]  He kind of admitted he was right.
[02:05:16.017 --> 02:05:17.577]  But I was yelling back at her.
[02:05:17.857 --> 02:05:23.901]  So I'm not judging you being mad at that lady, seeing a scam, sitting out there for hours, seeing them turn away nine people over three and a half hours.
[02:05:23.921 --> 02:05:25.261]  I would have been more pissed than you.
[02:05:25.722 --> 02:05:29.925]   But I bet if you go back to her and say, Well, I mean, she seemed pretty angry.
[02:05:30.085 --> 02:05:31.786]  Maybe called her and said, listen, I want to be friends.
[02:05:31.846 --> 02:05:32.387]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:32.807 --> 02:05:33.187]  Or whatever.
[02:05:33.207 --> 02:05:34.288]  I understand things went wrong.
[02:05:34.668 --> 02:05:35.569]  Tell me your reason.
[02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:39.693]  Maybe you'll find out the PR firm that told her to do this, why they told her.
[02:05:40.053 --> 02:05:41.194]  Because this is going on everywhere.
[02:05:41.234 --> 02:05:49.161]  Or maybe others that are doing this here in Austin can call us or send it to Corona at InfoWars.com, a new email we set up for tips and stuff.
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:54.020]   We're getting a lot of tips coming in on digital microchips under the skin.
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:58.740]   MIT Bill Gates, two days after we broke it, they came out and admitted it to prove you've
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.980]  had the vaccine.
[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:03.740]  Wristbands that change colors and track you.
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:07.460]  Marshall law forms you're going to have to travel.
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:11.541]   The bureaucracy is the one doing this, trying to push Trump into it.
[02:06:11.541 --> 02:06:14.180]  And so we really need to do the investigative reporting.
[02:06:14.205 --> 02:06:15.266]  It was spontaneous.
[02:06:15.386 --> 02:06:15.986]  You saw it.
[02:06:16.046 --> 02:06:16.887]  You saw the wrong.
[02:06:17.167 --> 02:06:17.567]  You did it.
[02:06:17.647 --> 02:06:18.508]  Nothing's more pure.
[02:06:18.848 --> 02:06:20.829]  And so, Jason Jones, thank you for the time.
[02:06:21.370 --> 02:06:22.911]  Movie2Movement.com.
[02:06:22.931 --> 02:06:24.492]  Please come back on with us again soon.
[02:06:25.672 --> 02:06:26.153]  It'd be an honor.
[02:06:26.253 --> 02:06:26.773]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:26.893 --> 02:06:27.794]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:06:29.707 --> 02:06:36.013]  You know, well, I just thank you for caring and your spiritedness and defending the Constitution and searching for the truth.
[02:06:36.033 --> 02:06:39.497]  You've been telling us there's been a water of minds for over two decades.
[02:06:40.277 --> 02:06:45.903]  And, you know, I think removing you from YouTube was a necessary condition to be able to do whatever's going on now.
[02:06:46.403 --> 02:06:48.265]  So, just thank you for being a pioneer.
[02:06:48.525 --> 02:06:49.066]  Thank you, sir.
[02:06:49.106 --> 02:06:49.706]  We're all in this together.
[02:06:49.726 --> 02:06:50.047]  God bless.
[02:06:50.067 --> 02:06:50.908]  Look forward to having you all again.
[02:06:52.042 --> 02:06:57.855]  There's so many good people out there like Jason Jones and just so many others out there and I'm gonna go to your calls now.
[02:06:57.995 --> 02:07:00.922]  Brad, Steve, Christian and X.
[02:07:02.355 --> 02:07:11.438]  And then I'm going to be up here, the crew's going to be up here late tonight, taking this big live video, archiving it, chopping out the powerful interview with Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, unbelievably important.
[02:07:11.958 --> 02:07:13.418]  This interview, incredibly important.
[02:07:13.798 --> 02:07:15.419]  And we're going to get them up to band on video.
[02:07:15.999 --> 02:07:18.800]  And we're getting videos up there, getting a half million, a million views.
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:20.760]  And we're paying for the bandwidth.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:21.520]  Thanks for your support.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.461]  But this interview needs to get out.
[02:07:24.401 --> 02:07:25.442]  Absolutely pronto.
[02:07:26.323 --> 02:07:27.704]  And so it's extremely powerful.
[02:07:28.325 --> 02:07:30.366]  And again, people always say, well, what is it?
[02:07:30.506 --> 02:07:31.267]  I go, I don't know.
[02:07:31.327 --> 02:07:32.268]  It doesn't add up.
[02:07:32.828 --> 02:07:34.250]  People say, well, then who did 9-11?
[02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:35.190]  I don't know.
[02:07:35.210 --> 02:07:40.635]  I was listening to the radio, taking a break that day on 9-11, and they said, we're going to blow up Building 7.
[02:07:41.196 --> 02:07:42.236]  The government's blowing it up.
[02:07:42.296 --> 02:07:43.137]  And then they blew it up.
[02:07:43.157 --> 02:07:46.680]  And then later, we got the archives of the footage on TV.
[02:07:47.001 --> 02:07:49.383]  They said it on like seven TV stations, we're blowing it up.
[02:07:50.436 --> 02:07:51.397]  I don't know what happened.
[02:07:51.417 --> 02:07:52.157]  They just blew it up.
[02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:54.298]  The official story isn't true.
[02:07:55.498 --> 02:07:58.880]  And then this whole thing with coronavirus has got holes in it.
[02:07:58.940 --> 02:08:01.281]  I'm not exactly sure what's going on yet.
[02:08:02.582 --> 02:08:06.403]  But I think John over here is right.
[02:08:07.764 --> 02:08:20.442]   They want to make sure that healthy people don't get recorded so that they can then Only use people that show up at hospital have a higher death rate to accentuate this martial law that has them so happy.
[02:08:20.722 --> 02:08:23.164]  It doesn't mean you shouldn't get vitamin D and zinc.
[02:08:23.444 --> 02:08:24.765]  It doesn't mean you shouldn't have iodine.
[02:08:24.805 --> 02:08:26.586]  It doesn't mean you shouldn't get sunshine, drink clean water.
[02:08:27.647 --> 02:08:29.809]  I mean, these are irrevocable freedoms we're losing.
[02:08:29.849 --> 02:08:30.670]  Okay, you don't care about those?
[02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:33.332]  It will cause a depression within a month and a half!
[02:08:35.683 --> 02:08:38.244]  Oh, and I don't care about the money myself.
[02:08:38.404 --> 02:08:43.226]  I care about people falling apart and people losing their houses and the crime.
[02:08:43.326 --> 02:08:44.727]  And I mean, it's just going to be hellish.
[02:08:45.087 --> 02:08:46.908]  And I've told the story a hundred times.
[02:08:46.928 --> 02:08:52.070]  I'll go to your calls, but I was going to my dad's uncle's funeral and I was driving up there alone.
[02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:53.270]  My dad had already left.
[02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:59.073]  I got to East Texas and I pulled into Waco before you take the turn to go to our ranch about an hour East of there.
[02:09:00.553 --> 02:09:02.894]  And we're there, you know, the cemetery near there.
[02:09:03.555 --> 02:09:06.096]  And I went into Luby's, somewhere I've been going since I was like three years old.
[02:09:06.116 --> 02:09:08.677]  So my earliest memories of going to this cafeteria started in Texas called Luby's.
[02:09:10.038 --> 02:09:24.746]  And I walked in there, and the first time ever I sat in the line with all those old ladies at lunch, or it was lunch, because they buried him in the afternoon, and I watched him not even able to get a Lou Anne platter.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.762]  You know, because they didn't have the money anymore.
[02:09:29.542 --> 02:09:32.245]  This is like during Obama when we're really in a big recession.
[02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:35.007]  It's like 10 years ago or so.
[02:09:36.148 --> 02:09:42.273]  And I was about to order a chicken fried steak and I was about to get sweet potatoes and macaroni and cheese and a salad.
[02:09:45.576 --> 02:09:46.196]  I just couldn't eat.
[02:09:49.899 --> 02:09:50.400]  And I just left.
[02:09:52.662 --> 02:09:56.903]  It ruined my meal to see those old ladies for the first time in my life.
[02:09:57.224 --> 02:10:03.826]  Because I've sat there as a kid on Sundays when there was lines out the door, and I watched old ladies get the food they wanted my whole life.
[02:10:05.026 --> 02:10:08.387]  And I've been at other restaurants, too, at other places, and I've been to the Luby's in Austin.
[02:10:08.407 --> 02:10:10.888]  Now it's downgraded and falling apart and scrappy, not as good as it used to be.
[02:10:11.308 --> 02:10:14.349]  But the point is, I went to Luby's a few times before that.
[02:10:14.369 --> 02:10:15.630]  I can't go to it.
[02:10:17.253 --> 02:10:20.174]  Because the average person can't eat.
[02:10:20.294 --> 02:10:22.914]  Under Trump, though, I'm told people are buying food again.
[02:10:23.034 --> 02:10:25.415]  It's not perfect, but this sucks.
[02:10:26.515 --> 02:10:28.256]  And it's being done artificially.
[02:10:29.536 --> 02:10:33.177]  And we've been turned into such cowards, on average, that people love it.
[02:10:34.037 --> 02:10:36.158]  Half the people I know are so into this.
[02:10:36.218 --> 02:10:37.138]  And I'm not blaming them.
[02:10:37.158 --> 02:10:38.218]  I'm not saying they're bad.
[02:10:38.298 --> 02:10:39.298]  I'm not mad at them.
[02:10:40.079 --> 02:10:41.279]  Because not everybody's a leader.
[02:10:44.602 --> 02:10:48.303]  And sometimes I lead people wrong, but my intentions are good.
[02:10:49.704 --> 02:10:51.204]  And you know, if you can mitigate something, great.
[02:10:51.224 --> 02:10:54.985]  If you've got family that's old and you're going to wear a mask or you're going to stay home, that's great.
[02:10:55.565 --> 02:10:56.606]  There's probably silver linings.
[02:10:56.626 --> 02:10:58.926]  You're not in the schools being taught by the drag queen story times.
[02:10:59.226 --> 02:11:06.748]  I've got articles right here that are unbelievably sick in what they illustrate.
[02:11:08.369 --> 02:11:10.970]  I mean, it reads like comedy when I find the article.
[02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:17.870]   It's like, People are not receiving life-saving transgender surgeries.
[02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:22.191]  And you read it, we're not able to chop eight-year-olds' testicles and penises off.
[02:11:22.531 --> 02:11:23.051]  Seriously!
[02:11:23.651 --> 02:11:25.112]  God, God, it's lifesaver!
[02:11:25.152 --> 02:11:29.433]  That little eight-year-old boy needs his balls fed into a woodchipper or we're all dead!
[02:11:29.873 --> 02:11:32.714]  And the headlines on InfoWars, we got a screenshot of the newspaper.
[02:11:33.354 --> 02:11:37.775]  It's like, we're not able to mutilate children.
[02:11:37.875 --> 02:11:39.575]  It's how they invert reality.
[02:11:40.075 --> 02:11:47.190]   Imagine if you read, there it is, As hospitals prepare for COVID-19, life-saving trans surgeries are delayed.
[02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:49.950]  Read the article.
[02:11:50.251 --> 02:11:51.491]  Vice promotes pedophilia, too.
[02:11:54.431 --> 02:11:55.772]  Let me hit that in a moment.
[02:11:55.792 --> 02:11:57.952]  But yeah, guys, I can't find the article.
[02:11:57.972 --> 02:11:58.572]  Reprint it for me.
[02:11:59.052 --> 02:12:00.252]  I really appreciate everybody holding here.
[02:12:00.292 --> 02:12:01.153]  I really appreciate you.
[02:12:01.693 --> 02:12:03.553]  I'm going to do more and more of these commercial-free shows.
[02:12:04.693 --> 02:12:07.894]  In fact, I'm not going to make the crew or guilt them into this.
[02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:14.895]  But if folks want to stay another hour tomorrow night, I'll do an hour of commercial free and take like 15 phone calls after the main show.
[02:12:15.275 --> 02:12:16.616]  Because these are the times to be on air.
[02:12:17.036 --> 02:12:19.118]  I mean, we might not be on air soon, folks.
[02:12:19.178 --> 02:12:20.779]  I mean, this is serious times, okay?
[02:12:21.039 --> 02:12:22.721]  Everything we told you is coming to a head right now.
[02:12:24.462 --> 02:12:25.663]  I'm supposed to be down here all the time.
[02:12:25.703 --> 02:12:26.344]  I can't even sleep.
[02:12:26.644 --> 02:12:29.726]  I'm operating on like eight hours sleep this week.
[02:12:30.787 --> 02:12:31.488]  And I got plenty of them.
[02:12:31.508 --> 02:12:34.150]  I mean, God's like, you need to get up off your ass, son.
[02:12:34.730 --> 02:12:35.511]  This is the biggin'.
[02:12:37.318 --> 02:12:38.719]  This, I'd shave my head.
[02:12:39.879 --> 02:12:41.260]  Three, four weeks ago, people said, what are you there for?
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.241]  I said, I did it because people need to know this is not normal times.
[02:12:45.321 --> 02:12:47.002]  Things are different, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:51.244 --> 02:12:55.866]  CPS worker uses coronavirus to falsely tell parents state is shutting down visits.
[02:12:57.568 --> 02:13:09.221]  Yeah, it's all, it's just, you want to live under tyranny and have your rights taken, have every nut case, you look at all those control freaks in Democrat areas, New York, California, they look like they're having orgasms.
[02:13:10.061 --> 02:13:14.701]   Because they now know they're gonna be able to do whatever they want and you can't everyone's gonna kiss their
[02:13:14.701 --> 02:13:23.341]   arbitrary butts Life-saving
[02:13:22.601 --> 02:13:27.240]   We need to chop little boys testicles off and give little girls deadly hormones!
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:34.242]   *sobbing* Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:13:33.734 --> 02:13:34.955]  Brad in Pennsylvania.
[02:13:34.975 --> 02:13:36.357]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:13:38.119 --> 02:13:39.220]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:39.921]  Love you, man.
[02:13:39.941 --> 02:13:42.824]  I appreciate all you're doing and keep up the great work.
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.565]  This stuff just smells of Agenda 21.
[02:13:48.825 --> 02:13:51.448]  I mean, it's... It's Agenda 2030.
[02:13:51.508 --> 02:13:52.610]  They got Agenda 21 in.
[02:13:52.650 --> 02:13:53.551]  This is Agenda 2030.
[02:13:54.772 --> 02:13:58.916]  Yeah, they've kind of taken the global warming thing and flipped it around on us personally.
[02:13:58.996 --> 02:14:04.703]  Oh yeah, cut the carbon, cut the travel, have the cell phone track you, force inoculate you, everything they want.
[02:14:05.973 --> 02:14:06.193]  Yep.
[02:14:06.393 --> 02:14:10.475]  And you wonder, is this just a temporary thing?
[02:14:10.615 --> 02:14:12.776]  Or are they just seeing what they can get away with?
[02:14:12.816 --> 02:14:14.776]  Are they going to put the full vice grips on us right now?
[02:14:14.796 --> 02:14:15.417]  Oh, this is it.
[02:14:15.617 --> 02:14:18.038]  I mean, the public, you saw Newsom.
[02:14:18.638 --> 02:14:20.419]  He says, listen, they go, can't we have martial law?
[02:14:20.439 --> 02:14:22.319]  And he goes, listen, it's a nuance.
[02:14:22.599 --> 02:14:23.220]  We already got it.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:25.881]  And then he just starts smiling.
[02:14:26.681 --> 02:14:28.362]  And you look at, I mean, this is it, brother.
[02:14:28.502 --> 02:14:28.822]  This is it.
[02:14:30.382 --> 02:14:34.083]  And poor Trump, as you always point out, I think he means well.
[02:14:34.123 --> 02:14:35.043]  He's just surrounded.
[02:14:35.063 --> 02:14:45.085]  He doesn't have a full grasp on the government, and so they keep backing him into corners, and he's just trying to fight his way out of it, but he doesn't know exactly what he's doing.
[02:14:45.405 --> 02:14:46.205]  It's just terrible.
[02:14:47.485 --> 02:14:57.507]  Listen, I don't say this because it's dangerous and people know it, but there's so few people... I'm not, again, saying this to act powerful.
[02:14:57.607 --> 02:14:58.067]  It's the truth.
[02:14:59.318 --> 02:15:01.319]  They know who listens in the White House, too.
[02:15:01.439 --> 02:15:10.184]  But there's a lot of folks, they didn't get rid of all of them, and more have come in that listen to the show because they hear the guests, they already get what's going on, and we really know what we're talking about.
[02:15:10.204 --> 02:15:11.345]  The callers know what they're talking about.
[02:15:11.365 --> 02:15:12.606]  I mean, where do you get stuff like this?
[02:15:12.666 --> 02:15:15.587]  So, yes, the president does get our information.
[02:15:15.948 --> 02:15:20.210]  That's been in the news, that's accurate in the news, and that's why they've considered just taking me out.
[02:15:20.230 --> 02:15:23.672]  But then, you know, now, the thing is, you guys all know how it works, too.
[02:15:24.052 --> 02:15:25.593]  It's not like I have this knowledge.
[02:15:25.633 --> 02:15:28.255]  It's knowing who the globalists are, how they operate.
[02:15:28.775 --> 02:15:31.337]  Like, there's plenty of people know how baseball works because it's got a lot of fans.
[02:15:31.437 --> 02:15:31.777]  Football.
[02:15:32.137 --> 02:15:33.458]  What about fans of reality?
[02:15:33.498 --> 02:15:44.926]  Well, we've got people thinking outside the box now, so they can't put the genie back in, so they're going full-on to, we'll just put your ass in a depression and make you be starving and not let you travel.
[02:15:46.428 --> 02:15:47.929]  They're going for broke, you're exactly right.
[02:15:48.209 --> 02:15:49.970]  Hey, you've got to get David Icke on, Alex.
[02:15:50.050 --> 02:15:54.093]  There was a great video he put out already on this, the coronavirus.
[02:15:54.313 --> 02:15:56.174]  I have been asking the producers to.
[02:15:57.255 --> 02:15:58.296]  Any word on David Icke?
[02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:02.424]  Any word on... He's coming on next week.
[02:16:03.185 --> 02:16:04.485]  He's a legend, just like you.
[02:16:04.545 --> 02:16:05.645]  He's all over this.
[02:16:06.205 --> 02:16:13.666]  And John Rappaport red-pilled me with this, because I was buying into it, completely going, you know, with all the information, it's overloading.
[02:16:13.706 --> 02:16:14.907]  You go, okay, it must be true.
[02:16:14.927 --> 02:16:16.547]  But Brad, you know what I said seven, eight weeks ago?
[02:16:16.587 --> 02:16:23.628]  I said, I don't know how deadly this is, but the hysteria and the unified propaganda, it's gonna be big for the economy and the police state.
[02:16:23.868 --> 02:16:25.708]  And that's why I said... And people are like, what do you mean?
[02:16:27.449 --> 02:16:28.249]  It's big either way.
[02:16:28.269 --> 02:16:28.909]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:16:29.908 --> 02:16:34.290]  I agree, but we don't know how true this is with the coronavirus.
[02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:36.630]  And I'm all with Rappaport on this.
[02:16:37.551 --> 02:16:43.973]  He's been studying these medical tyrannies for a long time, just like you have the police state.
[02:16:43.993 --> 02:16:48.814]  And this is no coincidence that they've crashed the economy, because we were free.
[02:16:48.935 --> 02:16:50.035]  We were cruise along.
[02:16:50.095 --> 02:16:51.075]  Trump had everything going.
[02:16:51.315 --> 02:16:52.956]  He was going to be re-elected, probably.
[02:16:53.496 --> 02:16:55.257]  He defeated the globalist paradigm.
[02:16:55.317 --> 02:16:56.657]  He was an example to everybody else.
[02:16:56.757 --> 02:17:03.820]  And the globalist said in the Financial Times and the CFR, we must destroy him and the West and the free market to defeat them.
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:10.042]  Because freedom is too hard for us to compete with the American system, just like the British king said 200 years ago plus.
[02:17:10.923 --> 02:17:13.924]  And so that's why the left admits they wanted to crash the economy.
[02:17:14.004 --> 02:17:16.545]  We've got to get the message out that they're the ones doing this.
[02:17:16.945 --> 02:17:17.645]  God bless you, Brad.
[02:17:17.685 --> 02:17:18.525]  Incredibly good points.
[02:17:19.286 --> 02:17:22.567]  You know, my dad is a chemist, not just a dentist and oral surgeon.
[02:17:23.916 --> 02:17:29.797]  And he's a voracious reader of medical literature and he's just been dead on with all the big scientific reports I've read and covered on air.
[02:17:30.558 --> 02:17:36.679]  I mean, he's just like, look, coronaviruses are constantly mutating.
[02:17:36.739 --> 02:17:38.720]  They constantly go off and drift off.
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:43.241]  And he said that they usually don't mutate to get worse.
[02:17:44.181 --> 02:17:46.802]  They usually mutate to get better because they've already mutated into a bad form.
[02:17:46.822 --> 02:17:49.682]  And that's a very narrow area as they drift off.
[02:17:53.315 --> 02:18:07.963]  I mean he thinks it's hyped up and I think it's coming clear that they don't want testing kits, Trump doesn't know why he's been lying to him at the CDC, and they don't want people getting tested because they don't want to show positive people that are getting better.
[02:18:08.623 --> 02:18:11.965]  Because then they have to be added into the UN's own equation.
[02:18:12.685 --> 02:18:14.566]  And then they don't get the massive fear they want.
[02:18:15.066 --> 02:18:19.408]  I'm saying get water filters and food, because they're putting us into a depression!
[02:18:19.848 --> 02:18:26.091]  I said eight weeks ago, I said, hey, you might want to get some terrible food, because they want a depression, and this could cause a worldwide depression.
[02:18:29.612 --> 02:18:30.513]  I mean, I'm telling you.
[02:18:34.935 --> 02:18:36.095]  Well, this is amazing.
[02:18:36.515 --> 02:18:37.096]  Oh, my God.
[02:18:38.216 --> 02:18:39.517]  And then it makes me so angry.
[02:18:39.537 --> 02:18:42.078]  I'm gonna hit this after I finish these three calls.
[02:18:44.022 --> 02:18:50.544]  That I spent hours last night and this morning only looking over what I already knew to be true.
[02:18:52.444 --> 02:18:57.286]  Zinc devastates all viruses.
[02:18:59.006 --> 02:19:07.949]  And there's been medical doctors come out and say that, and then they get calls from the FDA, I found it in the news, saying, hey, nothing's been said to be effective or a treatment.
[02:19:08.988 --> 02:19:14.290]  They don't even have a medical degree, but they don't want even medical doctors saying, oh no, this is a new thing.
[02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:21.393]  You can't say there's anything to help with it, even though vitamin D, zinc, nanosilver, it's literally ridiculous!
[02:19:21.672 --> 02:19:25.992]   the Japanese, the Russians, the Italians, the Pentagon, they all know it!
[02:19:25.992 --> 02:19:36.152]  Because they want to scare the living snot out of you.
[02:19:36.359 --> 02:19:48.093]   And they don't want you to know That zinc has been found in studies in different ways brought into the body, but mainly aerosolized and shot into the lungs, is one of the better treatments for the cases.
[02:19:48.893 --> 02:19:49.833]  I'm not selling that.
[02:19:50.734 --> 02:19:55.635]  But the government doesn't even, the bureaucracy doesn't even want us to tell you that.
[02:19:56.495 --> 02:20:00.656]  And that ingesting it in the levels recommended.
[02:20:01.356 --> 02:20:04.297]  I talked to a pharmacist, I talked to a medical doctor two days ago.
[02:20:05.598 --> 02:20:09.800]  And they said, you don't want to take more than three times the recommended because it can hurt your kidneys long term.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:12.702]  And I went out to a bunch of stores and had my assistant do it.
[02:20:13.442 --> 02:20:17.524]  And we sell one that has the recommended daily allowance and a multivitamin.
[02:20:18.024 --> 02:20:24.107]  But I got one for my parents and others that is right at three times the recommended daily allowance, like 30 milligrams.
[02:20:25.048 --> 02:20:25.288]  Okay.
[02:20:26.308 --> 02:20:29.210]  And I was reading the studies at 30 milligrams.
[02:20:30.319 --> 02:20:32.141]  I mean, this should be everywhere.
[02:20:32.621 --> 02:20:32.901]  Zinc!
[02:20:34.142 --> 02:20:34.383]  Zinc!
[02:20:35.624 --> 02:20:35.884]  Zinc!
[02:20:37.025 --> 02:20:37.305]  Zinc!
[02:20:39.167 --> 02:20:39.627]  Nowhere.
[02:20:40.308 --> 02:20:44.651]  Other than, uh, you're a medical doctor, uh, or you're a virologist.
[02:20:44.671 --> 02:20:45.352]  Well, actually, I am.
[02:20:45.772 --> 02:20:49.395]  Well, you were on a local CBS News channel saying this is the number one thing.
[02:20:49.696 --> 02:20:52.999]  You know, we don't want, uh, we don't look into your practice there.
[02:20:53.339 --> 02:20:57.923]  They don't want you to protect yourselves.
[02:20:59.923 --> 02:21:13.587]  But I guarantee you, those people, the political ones, not everybody's bad in the government, most of them actually, but the little political ones that work for Big Pharma, the revolving door of Big Pharma, they're all at home with their vitamin D and their zinc and their nanosilver.
[02:21:14.327 --> 02:21:16.267]  Disgusting!
[02:21:18.128 --> 02:21:19.728]  Disgusting!
[02:21:21.109 --> 02:21:24.450]  Christian in Houston, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead, then Steven.
[02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:29.271]  Hey, thanks for having me, it's an honor to be on your show, long time listener.
[02:21:29.978 --> 02:21:32.660]  I wanted to talk about the economics in this.
[02:21:33.081 --> 02:21:40.867]  One thing that I haven't heard about from too many people is the BRICS Bank, which is a new world bank that was created.
[02:21:41.648 --> 02:21:42.989]  Russia, China, and India.
[02:21:43.890 --> 02:21:44.370]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:45.991 --> 02:21:46.872]  Look at the numbers.
[02:21:46.952 --> 02:21:48.493]  Brazil, three deaths.
[02:21:48.994 --> 02:21:50.375]  Russia, zero.
[02:21:50.855 --> 02:21:52.096]  India, one.
[02:21:52.497 --> 02:21:54.078]  China, we can rule them out.
[02:21:54.118 --> 02:21:55.479]  They enjoy killing their own people.
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:57.661]  South Africa, zero.
[02:21:59.301 --> 02:22:08.267]  The global currency crisis that's taking place, and the BRICS Bank is using the Chinese Yen to back up their currency.
[02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:15.671]  Basically, the Chinese Yen, or the Chinese Yuan, whatever you want to call it, is the currency for the BRICS Bank.
[02:22:16.652 --> 02:22:20.534]  And I feel that this was completely created by those countries.
[02:22:20.554 --> 02:22:25.958]  That's why Trump was trying to build a strong relationship with the UK, because the UK was just getting ready to join.
[02:22:26.519 --> 02:22:29.581]  The BRICS Bank up until recently when Boris Johnson won.
[02:22:30.582 --> 02:22:32.903]  He's trying to build a relationship with the Brazil leader.
[02:22:33.164 --> 02:22:40.789]  He just went to India, had an unprecedented meeting there with the Indian leader.
[02:22:41.409 --> 02:22:44.632]  He's trying to break apart that bank.
[02:22:44.912 --> 02:22:49.755]  And I think this has Russia and China smeared all over it.
[02:22:49.875 --> 02:22:52.157]  And I think Trump's doing a fantastic job.
[02:22:53.192 --> 02:22:57.154]  Oh, I've said, I've said and the Pentagon believes this and so does the Intelligence Committee.
[02:22:57.194 --> 02:22:59.235]  I said it, I'm not bragging, I just said it three weeks before they did.
[02:22:59.896 --> 02:23:01.516]  It's a CHICOM bioweapon.
[02:23:01.796 --> 02:23:03.477]  I don't think really Russia's involved.
[02:23:03.517 --> 02:23:05.959]  I'm on a Russophile or a Russophobe.
[02:23:06.459 --> 02:23:08.560]  But no, this is CHICOM slash Deep State.
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:10.761]  A hundred percent to bring down our economy.
[02:23:12.722 --> 02:23:13.262]  Absolutely.
[02:23:13.582 --> 02:23:19.668]   And so I think, too, I wanted to call in too when A few weeks ago, y'all were pushing the Bitcoin thing.
[02:23:19.708 --> 02:23:22.291]  I wanted to call in to say, man, go buy gold and silver.
[02:23:22.391 --> 02:23:24.734]  All the mints are shut down right now.
[02:23:24.894 --> 02:23:25.374]  No, no, sir.
[02:23:25.455 --> 02:23:26.776]  I was saying it, but I was not.
[02:23:26.816 --> 02:23:28.959]  Listen, Max Keiser's a nice guy, OK?
[02:23:28.979 --> 02:23:29.659]  He's a funny guy.
[02:23:29.699 --> 02:23:31.662]  He said Alex Jones endorses Bitcoin.
[02:23:32.282 --> 02:23:41.767]  I agreed with him that I like alternate digital currencies, not as investments, but as alternate modes that have exchanges you can cash out for other currencies.
[02:23:41.967 --> 02:23:45.409]  I want diversity in currencies, not one world government currency.
[02:23:46.129 --> 02:23:50.731]  And that now, with all the big guys getting into Bitcoin and other systems, that they're going to take it over.
[02:23:51.532 --> 02:23:57.555]  So, nothing against Max, but you have endorsed and then, you know, Schiff took the bait.
[02:23:58.895 --> 02:24:01.217]  And it was like, Jones is totally sold out on the Bitcoin.
[02:24:01.917 --> 02:24:07.121]  I simply said, okay, I think I'll start trading in it and learning about it and all that, because I need to.
[02:24:08.242 --> 02:24:08.722]  God bless you.
[02:24:08.742 --> 02:24:10.343]  I appreciate your call, Christian.
[02:24:10.844 --> 02:24:11.504]  All right.
[02:24:11.544 --> 02:24:13.405]  Steven in Nebraska, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:15.086 --> 02:24:16.407]  Hey, Mr. Jones and crew.
[02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:17.848]  Hope all are doing well there.
[02:24:18.569 --> 02:24:20.450]  I just want to share some encouragement with everybody.
[02:24:20.490 --> 02:24:21.371]  I'll be real quick with it.
[02:24:21.831 --> 02:24:22.792]  Matthew 10, 28, John 3, 16, and Hebrews 10, 24, 25.
[02:24:22.952 --> 02:24:23.893]  Go read those verses.
[02:24:27.728 --> 02:24:29.510]  Don't just read the verses, but read the chapters.
[02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:35.116]  But talking about Land of Confusion, I mean, I really enjoy your show.
[02:24:35.136 --> 02:24:40.641]  I've been listening for a while, and I've heard you talk out about PC culture a lot.
[02:24:41.402 --> 02:24:47.048]  And when we're sitting here dealing with it right now, it's like, in the beginning, it was the Wuhan China virus, 2019, right?
[02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:52.754]  And now it's like we're having to use their new term, the COVID-19, which I'm choosing not to do.
[02:24:53.034 --> 02:24:53.935]  Exactly.
[02:24:54.476 --> 02:24:57.138]  And they're even changing Spanish flu in the encyclopedias.
[02:24:57.219 --> 02:24:58.179]  It came out of Spain.
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:00.221]  It's called the Spanish flu.
[02:25:01.863 --> 02:25:02.364]  Right.
[02:25:02.444 --> 02:25:14.124]   And then you have things, which I'm going to go down a rabbit trail here, but you go back to like pre-1972 before Nixon came into office with his State, what was a security estate at the time with him was
[02:25:14.124 --> 02:25:18.043]   what Henry Kissinger But there was no relationship really going on with the
[02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:22.204]   United States and China And then we entered back into a relationship back in
[02:25:22.204 --> 02:25:27.904]   1972 and then moving forward the thing that kind of concerns me a little bit which I voted for Trump and I
[02:25:27.904 --> 02:25:31.674]   support Trump and I understand he and everyone in our country right now have
[02:25:31.674 --> 02:25:36.986]   a very difficult time with this situation And I'm not trying to beat up on him, but there's something that kind of stood out.
[02:25:37.026 --> 02:25:43.868]  I was watching a snippet that you had the other day with some ominous music behind it about Harry Kissinger and his support of the New World Order.
[02:25:44.288 --> 02:25:51.250]  And then Trump does an interview with them sitting side by side and him talking about his close relationship with him.
[02:25:51.570 --> 02:26:02.399]   And I'm not saying that Trump is to blame, but you even brought up a good point earlier whenever you were sitting there talking about his affiliation with the The wrestling, um, like company or whatever.
[02:26:02.659 --> 02:26:06.402]  And it's like, it's kind of hard with all this information.
[02:26:06.261 --> 02:26:10.100]   anyways I'm just going on but what do you know he's allowing ZZ ping to do
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:15.661]   face-saving ball he's while he's defeating him so I explained that Trump
[02:26:15.661 --> 02:26:23.492]   like wrestling understands there's a dialectic I'm not saying it's like Iron Sheik and Hulk Hogan behind the scenes drinking beer together and being buddies.
[02:26:24.513 --> 02:26:26.455]  I'm saying Trump understands a dialectic.
[02:26:27.035 --> 02:26:33.002]  He needs to let the press come in who've been unopposed, let them attack him for real, and then chew him up and spit him out.
[02:26:33.282 --> 02:26:34.043]  God bless you, Steven.
[02:26:34.063 --> 02:26:34.723]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:36.646 --> 02:26:43.875]  Yeah, that's what we said Sunday.
[02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:50.924]  Last Sunday, Trump was looking at it, and then now it's been leaking out, and we've seen evidence it'll be Sunday or Monday if he's gonna do it.
[02:26:51.265 --> 02:26:53.547]  He hinted that he won't do it yesterday, but who knows?
[02:26:55.478 --> 02:26:56.058]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:56.118 --> 02:26:58.200]  So, yeah, I'm a longtime listener.
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.341]  I'm a huge fan of yours.
[02:26:59.481 --> 02:27:06.806]  And to be totally honest with you, this is the first time I've called in because, you know, I really do understand a lot of things that you speak about.
[02:27:07.966 --> 02:27:11.108]  And, you know, I don't want black helicopters flying over my house.
[02:27:11.329 --> 02:27:13.270]  However, I do have inside information.
[02:27:13.290 --> 02:27:16.492]  I felt compelled to let the people know.
[02:27:16.672 --> 02:27:20.575]  Perhaps we can do something to stop this if somebody can, you know, do something.
[02:27:21.615 --> 02:27:24.297]  Anyways, I live in Orange County, South Orange County.
[02:27:24.337 --> 02:27:31.639]   That is And one of the biggest dry cleaners out here happened to be a good family friend of mine.
[02:27:32.299 --> 02:27:49.525]  And my dad, who goes there every Saturday to get his laundry and to hang out and talk to the owner and stuff, was told this morning because the dry cleaner does all the police uniforms, all the sheriffs in this area.
[02:27:50.045 --> 02:28:00.280]   And so what he was told and what was reiterated to me was that Starting in Los Angeles and Long Beach, the National Guard is coming out on Monday for sure.
[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:09.364]  They're going to be actually protecting all the businesses from looters, from riots, from all sorts of people that, you know, don't have anything.
[02:28:09.384 --> 02:28:12.426]  And that it is starting in L.A.
[02:28:12.686 --> 02:28:19.069]  and in Long Beach on Monday, and they're expecting it to trickle down into Orange County thereafter.
[02:28:19.089 --> 02:28:27.432]   They don't know when, but what I was told was that the police will be Yeah, driving around all the roads, making sure nobody's on the road.
[02:28:28.372 --> 02:28:39.254]  They will be pulling people over, making sure that you're only on the road for emergency purposes, such as getting tested at the hospital, possibly groceries, but we don't know yet.
[02:28:39.294 --> 02:28:40.495]  That's still kind of up in the air.
[02:28:40.515 --> 02:28:48.116]  We don't know about if Trump is going to nationalize the groceries companies, Costco, Walmart, all those yet.
[02:28:48.156 --> 02:28:52.097]  That's probably going to happen over the next couple of weeks, maybe even sooner.
[02:28:52.797 --> 02:28:54.399]  So you start to connect all the dots.
[02:28:55.099 --> 02:29:00.484]  John Rapport, I encourage a lot of people to get on his email list on nomorefakenews.com.
[02:29:00.524 --> 02:29:02.085]  He's another guy in Southern California.
[02:29:02.125 --> 02:29:11.012]  I got an email from him yesterday going over the fact that the Italian numbers are completely skewed along with a lot of other places.
[02:29:11.072 --> 02:29:20.035]   The Rivavirin, which is the antiviral medication, is counteracting with people who have issues, already issues such as high blood pressure,
[02:29:20.035 --> 02:29:22.594]   diabetes, and it's actually causing them to die.
[02:29:22.594 --> 02:29:27.435]  I encourage people to read that article that he wrote.
[02:29:27.435 --> 02:29:33.154]   And then in terms of the David Icke interview that you hear a lot of callers
[02:29:32.987 --> 02:29:36.867]   a few minutes ago spoke about. I encourage people to watch that. That's on
[02:29:36.867 --> 02:29:42.028]   the London Real page on YouTube and you can it's about a 45 minute interview or
[02:29:42.028 --> 02:29:47.188]   David Icke really you know explains it without even going all into the crazy
[02:29:47.188 --> 02:29:51.587]   stuff. We've got him coming on this weekend. Yeah when he's on he's on
[02:29:51.587 --> 02:29:58.387]   chloroquine. It's an old 67 year old drug works great on malaria.
[02:29:56.597 --> 02:29:58.917]  They don't make money off of it, so they don't really prescribe it anymore.
[02:29:59.678 --> 02:30:01.618]  Bayer just gave millions of doses to the U.S.
[02:30:01.638 --> 02:30:01.958]  government.
[02:30:01.998 --> 02:30:02.578]  What does it do?
[02:30:02.718 --> 02:30:04.419]  It pushes zinc into the cells.
[02:30:05.179 --> 02:30:07.680]  Well, again, everyone just search engine.
[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:11.340]  Zinc antiviral.
[02:30:11.841 --> 02:30:17.762]  And it specifically says for the coronavirus family and shows electron microscopes, the scans.
[02:30:18.302 --> 02:30:19.683]  I mean, I'm going to show some of this in a minute.
[02:30:19.923 --> 02:30:20.643]  I'm going to end with this.
[02:30:21.912 --> 02:30:22.873]  Because it's so incredible.
[02:30:23.053 --> 02:30:27.816]  And then I found local doctors in Oklahoma, California, New York, and a few other places.
[02:30:28.317 --> 02:30:35.822]  And then I found an article where they had the government, the feds, telling a doctor he shouldn't be on TV saying zinc can help you.
[02:30:36.082 --> 02:30:40.105]  It's like saying oxygen may help you not asphyxiate.
[02:30:41.206 --> 02:30:43.547]  It's like saying water may help you not dehydrate.
[02:30:44.528 --> 02:30:54.548]   It's unbelievable the corporate agenda To say sit in your house and eat white bread and drink alcohol and wait to die instead of knowing what's good for people.
[02:30:55.088 --> 02:30:56.009]  We got about a minute left.
[02:30:56.209 --> 02:30:57.150]  X amazing points.
[02:30:57.770 --> 02:31:03.093]  Go back specifically into the dry cleaners because I happen to have White House sources and other information.
[02:31:03.133 --> 02:31:06.035]  I've been telling you that it looks like it'll be Monday or Sunday night.
[02:31:06.355 --> 02:31:07.796]  I predict 8 o'clock Sunday night.
[02:31:08.656 --> 02:31:09.797]  On record all last week.
[02:31:10.157 --> 02:31:12.798]  Don't have the crew to pull this clip, you know, when it happens on Monday.
[02:31:13.058 --> 02:31:15.319]  But Trump may, Trump may change his mind.
[02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:23.944]  But there's an excellent article breaking Trump eyes two-week quarantine, only drug and grocery stores open that came out last night in the Washington Examiner.
[02:31:24.504 --> 02:31:25.965]  This article is dead on.
[02:31:26.945 --> 02:31:29.586]  And I even meant to leave the show with that, but I, I didn't.
[02:31:29.686 --> 02:31:32.208]  So that's what they're pushing him to do.
[02:31:32.488 --> 02:31:34.209]  Or they're going to say every death is your fault.
[02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:36.850]  And the Democrats all declaring martial law already.
[02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:40.273]  And then they can say, oh look, we acted, you didn't.
[02:31:40.313 --> 02:31:47.801]  Even though it's in the Constitution, he controls the border, helps direct the states between each other, but the states are supposed to do this, so he's doing what he's supposed to.
[02:31:47.821 --> 02:31:51.626]  But go back to the cleaners, go back to what they said, the folks that clean the police uniforms.
[02:31:52.867 --> 02:32:00.850]  Yeah, so basically they are saying, they are being briefed by their upper, by their higher-ups that this is happening and nobody's stopping this.
[02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:01.791]  This is going to be happening.
[02:32:01.851 --> 02:32:05.052]  National Guard's going to be coming in Los Angeles and Long Beach.
[02:32:05.072 --> 02:32:11.935]  They're going to see how that goes over the course of the next few days, possibly even 24 hours, and it's going to start trickling down into Orange County.
[02:32:11.975 --> 02:32:14.436]  Me personally, I think that this is a huge psy-op.
[02:32:14.816 --> 02:32:18.838]  I think that they're, I've been listening to what you're saying and a lot of people are saying that are on your show.
[02:32:19.799 --> 02:32:27.608]  I do believe that this is to kind of see how far they can take society, and then they're going to reel back a little bit, but they're still going to take away our rights.
[02:32:28.061 --> 02:32:33.386]  As far as boots on the ground, I can't say whether or not that's going to happen.
[02:32:33.406 --> 02:32:35.508]  I can only tell you what the police are being briefed.
[02:32:35.568 --> 02:32:36.509]  Well, let me stop you, sir.
[02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:52.263]  They've already announced a week ago, now nine days ago, that they're going to put National Guard over all the key distribution centers, railheads, Walmart distribution centers, Costco distribution centers, and then they're going to go to the actual centers themselves and then to what are seen as hot spots.
[02:32:53.024 --> 02:32:55.967]  Uh, because they believe there's going to be food shortages within just a few weeks.
[02:32:56.708 --> 02:32:58.629]  Uh, and that's already breaking down the supply chain.
[02:32:58.990 --> 02:33:04.615]  You know, two weeks ago I said the supply chain's breaking down because I have the contacts and he's like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:33:04.635 --> 02:33:05.596]  And then now they're admitting it.
[02:33:05.936 --> 02:33:11.101]  So yes, sir, they are putting in an artificial system, but let's remember Trump's not, I'm not just defending Trump.
[02:33:11.401 --> 02:33:12.482]  He's not in full control.
[02:33:12.522 --> 02:33:13.163]  They're bucking him.
[02:33:13.183 --> 02:33:14.584]  You can see Fauci and others doing it.
[02:33:15.851 --> 02:33:16.492]  The military.
[02:33:16.712 --> 02:33:17.512]  There are troops.
[02:33:17.613 --> 02:33:18.834]  They're patriots on average.
[02:33:19.414 --> 02:33:21.015]  I'd say more informed than the average person.
[02:33:21.416 --> 02:33:22.477]  They know what's going on.
[02:33:22.877 --> 02:33:23.538]  They understand.
[02:33:23.578 --> 02:33:24.298]  They're not the enemy.
[02:33:24.619 --> 02:33:31.584]  The globalists may even pot shot or attack or shoot at firefighters or something, you know, to try to make an us against them situation.
[02:33:31.604 --> 02:33:33.706]  There are some groups that will probably attack the military.
[02:33:34.207 --> 02:34:00.440]   So the military Is being ordered to do this and and and so people should understand that they're following orders But if they violate our rights take guns from law-abiding citizens commandeer homes, you know violate the Seventh Amendment and and other areas then they enter the area of Tyrants and they're violating their oath and they're they've you know, really stepped into the boots of Nazis and so
[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:07.709]  But again, think about how they're going to try to sign off, because I was reading this last night, and then reading the different federal directives.
[02:34:07.970 --> 02:34:09.372]  Guys, can I have that article I asked for?
[02:34:09.432 --> 02:34:10.513]  Thank you, the examiner.
[02:34:10.553 --> 02:34:11.455]  Thank you.
[02:34:12.657 --> 02:34:14.219]  Everything I pull up, just print me a copy.
[02:34:14.239 --> 02:34:15.280]  That's the way to handle it.
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:15.561]  Thank you.
[02:34:17.079 --> 02:34:24.201]  He talks about a federal act in there, and I went and read that federal act that they're saying is just short of martial law, but what it really is is martial law.
[02:34:24.562 --> 02:34:29.783]  And I was thinking, how are they going to try to play us off against each other?
[02:34:30.163 --> 02:34:39.006]  Because when they cut the food off, when they shut the systems down, when they shut down the mom and pops, when they do that, that's going to create riots within a month or so.
[02:34:39.487 --> 02:34:46.169]  And then now the stage is set for the left to exacerbate it as much as they can, and we know that's in the different Antifa documents.
[02:34:46.229 --> 02:34:46.469]  Thank you.
[02:34:47.009 --> 02:34:49.331]  So, this is it.
[02:34:49.411 --> 02:34:50.071]  This is the big one.
[02:34:50.091 --> 02:34:51.312]  This is testing us.
[02:34:51.392 --> 02:34:55.255]  And if we accept it and go along with it, then they're going to totally take over.
[02:34:56.675 --> 02:34:59.457]  But if we revolt and burn things down, they're going to take over.
[02:35:00.378 --> 02:35:05.221]  Because then the troops will follow the orders to take over because they were getting shot at and things are burning.
[02:35:05.281 --> 02:35:11.005]  But that will probably be staged by folks that are working for globalist operations.
[02:35:11.245 --> 02:35:14.627]  Thank you so much, X in California.
[02:35:14.867 --> 02:35:15.088]  Okay.
[02:35:15.928 --> 02:35:16.889]  Let me show you this article.
[02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:19.293]  Breaking Trump Eyes Two Week Quarantine.
[02:35:20.638 --> 02:35:22.338]  Only drug and grocery stores open.
[02:35:22.498 --> 02:35:32.701]  President Trump, moving with haste to slow the spread of the coronavirus, is preparing to plan a, mobilize the National Guard to help enforce a two-week quarantine of the public, which is already going on.
[02:35:33.101 --> 02:35:36.722]  Remember, they're deploying all over the country, so they always deploy first, then tell you it's happening.
[02:35:37.882 --> 02:35:48.685]  If his tough love efforts so far fail, the unprecedented action would require anyone to stay at home, according to a source knowledgeable to the evolving plan.
[02:35:50.424 --> 02:35:59.892]  The effort, which is still being mulled and wouldn't be announced until early next week if needed, would urge that all businesses except grocery stores and pharmacies be closed.
[02:36:00.513 --> 02:36:06.478]  And that's not actually, you have to have the warehouses, you have to have the security, you have to have the media, never talks about itself.
[02:36:07.859 --> 02:36:11.362]  Saying media, TV, radio, print isn't essential.
[02:36:11.462 --> 02:36:11.823]  It is.
[02:36:11.903 --> 02:36:13.864]  In all the emergency declarations it already is.
[02:36:15.567 --> 02:36:19.372]  Then leftist jurisdictions look for them to try to use this to shut down the people's media.
[02:36:20.393 --> 02:36:26.822]  It comes on the heels of other insider reports that the president is considering grounding all US passenger flights to halt.
[02:36:28.106 --> 02:36:30.447]  In people interacting and moving around the country.
[02:36:30.767 --> 02:36:32.528]  That's interstate travel bans.
[02:36:32.948 --> 02:36:34.048]  Told you about that last Sunday.
[02:36:34.828 --> 02:36:36.589]  And then it just goes on from there.
[02:36:37.169 --> 02:36:42.631]  Trump has praised the public for following the rules he has put in place.
[02:36:43.071 --> 02:36:48.153]  But the new plans are an acknowledge that many people are not taking the warnings seriously.
[02:36:48.233 --> 02:36:50.654]  What, those of some college kids running around and partying?
[02:36:50.994 --> 02:36:53.195]  We've all got to, you know, live in a concentration camp now?
[02:36:53.856 --> 02:37:00.095]  In some areas, the National Guard has already been called out to enforce stay-in-place orders, a model of what Trump is considering.
[02:37:01.007 --> 02:37:05.630]  In Washington, D.C., the guard has been activated in the city on Friday, said it's school closings until the end of April.
[02:37:06.010 --> 02:37:07.891]  And the globalists have said they want 18 months.
[02:37:07.911 --> 02:37:09.252]  That will be Stone Age by then.
[02:37:10.013 --> 02:37:14.536]  Wisconsin has also activated the guard, and so has Florida, New Jersey, and Arizona.
[02:37:14.796 --> 02:37:19.699]  California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statewide order for all residents to stay at home until further notice.
[02:37:20.039 --> 02:37:21.860]  He's also put the National Guard on notice.
[02:37:22.221 --> 02:37:25.283]  Illinois did the same, and there are also parts of New York on shutdown.
[02:37:25.603 --> 02:37:28.024]  The federal government has been reluctant to order stay-in-place.
[02:37:29.265 --> 02:37:39.791]  Order, but officials have said that the administration has been briefing Congress, states, and industry leaders about the potential shutdown that could start next week and after the president taps the Stanford Act.
[02:37:40.031 --> 02:37:42.953]  I have a copy at home, I forgot to read that.
[02:37:43.413 --> 02:37:45.334]  Some say it allows national quarantine.
[02:37:45.834 --> 02:37:50.377]  The goal, said officials, is to stop the spread of the virus and potential deaths.
[02:37:50.477 --> 02:37:52.078]  The Stanford Act's never been done before, folks.
[02:37:55.131 --> 02:38:00.554]  Unknown, the administration, hopes that the number of cases of coronavirus does not surge too much.
[02:38:01.034 --> 02:38:02.055]  Well, it's going to surge, folks.
[02:38:02.075 --> 02:38:02.876]  It's hardly anything right now.
[02:38:03.476 --> 02:38:10.500]  A knowledgeable source of the Department of Homeland Security officials are telling states that it is ready to mobilize the National Guard and dispatch them from U.S.
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:11.601]  military first responders.
[02:38:12.361 --> 02:38:19.963]  The goal is to have them dispatched before any call for the National Guard quarantine.
[02:38:20.343 --> 02:38:20.783]  The reason?
[02:38:20.823 --> 02:38:24.744]  Stop looters and other violence because they know the depression is going to cause that.
[02:38:25.264 --> 02:38:27.064]  So they're creating a crisis offering a solution.
[02:38:27.445 --> 02:38:33.966]  They will announce this soon as the troops are in place and help prevent looters and rioters and will announce before the end of the weekend.
[02:38:34.366 --> 02:38:36.087]  Everybody's staying at home being good right now.
[02:38:36.187 --> 02:38:36.907]  Why would that happen?
[02:38:37.207 --> 02:38:44.794]   Because The food is going to stop coming if they keep this depression going and lock down more businesses because it will kill confidence.
[02:38:44.854 --> 02:38:46.135]  It will kill the stock market.
[02:38:46.155 --> 02:38:48.238]  It will kill business deals going forward.
[02:38:49.279 --> 02:38:50.380]  It will create panic.
[02:38:53.109 --> 02:38:56.431]  And that is just the plan, and this is America under attack.
[02:38:56.451 --> 02:38:57.331]  This is a world war.
[02:38:57.351 --> 02:38:58.091]  It's a psy-op.
[02:38:58.491 --> 02:38:59.512]  It's a physical war.
[02:38:59.552 --> 02:39:00.492]  It's an economic war.
[02:39:01.113 --> 02:39:06.755]  All right, let me hit these final points and thank the crew for coming in for what's coming up to be a three-hour transmission.
[02:39:06.875 --> 02:39:33.170]   I mentioned this earlier, but I am going to beg listeners for your own sake and your family's sake and other people's sake and for the globalists not getting a higher death toll that they need to drive a stake into the heart of our recovery, I am going to ask you To research chloroquine and the fact that it's an anti-malarial drug that you take when you go into a malaria area.
[02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:34.832]  It doesn't work as well once you have it.
[02:39:36.734 --> 02:39:40.878]  Chloroquine, an old malaria drug, and the studies that it helps with the coronavirus.
[02:39:42.199 --> 02:39:43.361]  What does it do?
[02:39:46.324 --> 02:39:47.285]  What does it do?
[02:39:49.187 --> 02:39:56.409]  It admittedly drives zinc, even if you're deficient, out of other tissues into the cells and into the mitochondria.
[02:39:57.129 --> 02:40:01.249]  A virus has trouble getting in through the cell membrane when there is zinc in the body.
[02:40:01.290 --> 02:40:16.573]  It coats it, it's electrical, it's like an electric fence, it's conductive, and it goes into the cell and protects the mitochondria so that the virus can, has a lot of trouble injecting and then replicating more viruses.
[02:40:16.432 --> 02:40:18.432]  as it takes over the cell like a factory.
[02:40:18.432 --> 02:40:30.822]   Well, they're not gonna give you chloroquine Well, okay, that doesn't make sense.
[02:40:31.982 --> 02:40:36.983]  So, instead you go to InfoWars.com and you read this for yourself and you spend a couple hours.
[02:40:37.023 --> 02:40:37.783]  A couple hours!
[02:40:37.883 --> 02:40:38.944]  And then you send it on to others.
[02:40:40.504 --> 02:40:45.965]  Oxford University report on documented antiviral effects of zinc in the human body.
[02:40:46.025 --> 02:40:49.405]  And they're just republishing a big American Journal article.
[02:40:49.846 --> 02:40:52.046]  The role of zinc in antiviral immunity.
[02:40:53.092 --> 02:41:00.538]  And then we also published four other big prestigious studies under it, with all the links.
[02:41:00.959 --> 02:41:02.320]  You want to spend the next month reading it.
[02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:04.282]  And boy, will you get an education.
[02:41:04.302 --> 02:41:05.863]  You'll go, I heard all this from Alex.
[02:41:06.163 --> 02:41:06.904]  How does he know that?
[02:41:07.464 --> 02:41:09.586]  Well, I have antiviral experts on it, doctors on it.
[02:41:09.606 --> 02:41:10.487]  I can read these reports.
[02:41:10.567 --> 02:41:14.270]  And I always ask, like, why does nano silver kill viruses?
[02:41:15.231 --> 02:41:16.932]  Well, because it's electrical and it fries them.
[02:41:17.292 --> 02:41:18.634]  And it coats cells so they can't get in.
[02:41:18.854 --> 02:41:19.534]  Why does copper?
[02:41:19.875 --> 02:41:20.495]  Why does zinc?
[02:41:20.575 --> 02:41:21.216]  Zinc's the best.
[02:41:22.967 --> 02:41:25.068]  Not topically, but inside, according to this!
[02:41:25.428 --> 02:41:25.908]  I'm reading!
[02:41:27.228 --> 02:41:29.049]  Oh, but this is the royalty of the scientists!
[02:41:29.069 --> 02:41:29.609]  You can't read it!
[02:41:31.189 --> 02:41:38.151]  Well, the media won't tell you all this, so I suggest you go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and I suggest you share this.
[02:41:39.811 --> 02:41:41.612]  Now, let me go to the actual studies here.
[02:41:43.112 --> 02:41:46.313]  The role of zinc in antiviral immunity.
[02:41:49.929 --> 02:41:57.437]  And this is, again, of the American Society of Nutrition.
[02:41:58.698 --> 02:42:01.461]  And it's got all these scientists, and it shows what it does.
[02:42:02.562 --> 02:42:03.123]  Here's another one.
[02:42:04.825 --> 02:42:07.928]  Journal of Biomedical Science, and it's all these prestigious universities.
[02:42:07.988 --> 02:42:08.709]  I'm not going to read it all.
[02:42:09.069 --> 02:42:11.652]  Inhibition of H1N1 influenza virus infection.
[02:42:11.732 --> 02:42:12.292]  That's in the lungs.
[02:42:13.599 --> 02:42:17.923]  By zinc oxide nanoparticles, another emerging application of nanomedicine.
[02:42:17.943 --> 02:42:19.284]  It's got all the graphs, all of it.
[02:42:19.304 --> 02:42:21.706]  You know, we're talking 98% stopping it.
[02:42:21.726 --> 02:42:23.607]  It is unbelievable, knocking the virus down.
[02:42:23.647 --> 02:42:24.308]  I mean, you just might.
[02:42:24.548 --> 02:42:30.593]  Electron microscopes, everything else, just... You're not gonna get this in hospitals in America.
[02:42:30.833 --> 02:42:31.814]  They want maximum death.
[02:42:32.334 --> 02:42:33.655]  Not the average nurse or doctor.
[02:42:33.835 --> 02:42:35.116]  They're just not allowed to do this.
[02:42:36.137 --> 02:42:37.878]  Royalty and stuff, they get it.
[02:42:38.399 --> 02:42:40.941]  Fancy clinics, people come to their house, no problem.
[02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:44.611]  But not you, American scum.
[02:42:45.891 --> 02:42:46.812]  Oh, here's another big one.
[02:42:48.652 --> 02:42:52.514]  This is Microbiology, Immunology, Vanderbilt University.
[02:42:52.934 --> 02:42:54.675]  And then it goes through a bunch of other top universities.
[02:42:54.735 --> 02:43:00.477]  Effects of zinc salts on respiratory virus replication in babies.
[02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:04.278]  And how it just massively, I mean, look at these graphs.
[02:43:04.338 --> 02:43:05.599]  It saves the babies.
[02:43:07.042 --> 02:43:08.303]  We don't want to save babies.
[02:43:09.204 --> 02:43:10.366]  We don't want to tell you about that.
[02:43:10.466 --> 02:43:11.988]  There's no known treatment.
[02:43:12.228 --> 02:43:13.349]  There's no known cure.
[02:43:13.369 --> 02:43:15.091]  Like, well, that's just coronavirus.
[02:43:15.151 --> 02:43:17.414]  It's different.
[02:43:17.454 --> 02:43:22.299]  Zinc specifically inhibits early stages of the dengue fever virus.
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:24.262]  Replication by activation.
[02:43:25.472 --> 02:43:29.935]  And it goes on of antiviral response, and it also kills the autoimmune response that kills you.
[02:43:30.255 --> 02:43:41.081]  This is out of the big journal of immunology, and it's like, you know, Tokyo University, top scientist, University of California, San Francisco, medical director.
[02:43:41.722 --> 02:43:42.682]  I mean, just go rid of yourself.
[02:43:43.503 --> 02:43:45.084]  Oh, but that's not coronavirus.
[02:43:46.785 --> 02:43:49.066]  ZN2, that's zinc on a periodic table.
[02:43:50.603 --> 02:44:02.092]  ZN2 plus inhibits coronavirus and antivirus RNA activity in vitro and zinc block the replication of these viruses in cell culture.
[02:44:05.374 --> 02:44:08.737]  Bet I'll get a call tomorrow and you're gonna be arrested if you show people that.
[02:44:08.877 --> 02:44:11.459]  You shut your mouth, dirty American!
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:15.462]  The bureaucrats don't care about their kids, their grandma, anybody!
[02:44:16.103 --> 02:44:20.006]  They tell you there's nothing you can do because they're bought and paid for by big pharma.
[02:44:20.717 --> 02:44:22.378]  Not all the bureaucrats are the ones running the show.
[02:44:23.178 --> 02:44:26.799]  We got inside, as Americans, because you don't see this anywhere.
[02:44:27.639 --> 02:44:31.621]  A top former, he's retired now, virologist, he's super respected, I have that article here.
[02:44:33.962 --> 02:44:35.442]  He put a letter out on the internet.
[02:44:35.762 --> 02:44:38.203]  He put a letter out to his family saying, get your zinc.
[02:44:39.664 --> 02:44:46.746]  And somebody put it on Facebook, it went viral, so they had a Snopes and a New York Times saying, well, he didn't really mean it would help you.
[02:44:48.106 --> 02:44:49.147]  So it's partially true.
[02:44:50.077 --> 02:44:51.077]  It's an article in the New York Times.
[02:44:51.157 --> 02:44:53.058]  Well, is it true on top of her up?
[02:44:53.118 --> 02:44:57.239]  Well, yeah, I did say, but you don't want it.
[02:44:57.939 --> 02:45:00.000]  You don't want it.
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:01.680]  That's who these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:03.861]  And that's how they operate.
[02:45:04.661 --> 02:45:05.201]  And it's sick.
[02:45:07.081 --> 02:45:13.263]  If you already get it from my lay reading of this, it would help you some.
[02:45:13.283 --> 02:45:14.483]  Go read it for yourself.
[02:45:14.943 --> 02:45:16.384]  But it's preventative.
[02:45:17.529 --> 02:45:20.472]  Like, don't smoke two packs of cigarettes a day and drink a bottle of vodka.
[02:45:20.812 --> 02:45:24.255]  You probably won't get lung cancer when you're young and your liver might last longer.
[02:45:25.135 --> 02:45:25.936]  Can't say that!
[02:45:25.996 --> 02:45:26.737]  You're not a doctor!
[02:45:28.498 --> 02:45:28.919]  Okay.
[02:45:28.939 --> 02:45:33.402]  I want to thank the great crew for coming in tonight.
[02:45:33.522 --> 02:45:41.069]  If you're watching this live, we will have the archive of this up for you to share once it's not live very, very soon.
[02:45:41.109 --> 02:45:42.450]  There's a glitch in the system today.
[02:45:43.376 --> 02:45:47.217]  Where we usually have it where it's live and it archives right through and is right there for you.
[02:45:48.058 --> 02:45:53.119]  But for some reason that glitch, it's not been fixed for about a year, but we're going to work on that.
[02:45:53.139 --> 02:45:56.801]  We've got a great crew, there's a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff in the air.
[02:45:57.621 --> 02:46:00.242]  But as soon as this is over, just remember attention spans key.
[02:46:01.306 --> 02:46:02.947]  It should be archived at Bandot Video.
[02:46:02.987 --> 02:46:04.208]  It's the top featured video.
[02:46:05.088 --> 02:46:08.590]  And it will be posted at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:08.610 --> 02:46:09.971]  But if you share that, they'll try to block it.
[02:46:09.991 --> 02:46:11.051]  So get it from NewsWars.com.
[02:46:11.211 --> 02:46:13.733]  I'm trying to get Paul to post it on his site, Summit.News.
[02:46:13.753 --> 02:46:17.755]  I know the folks over at National File, maybe they'll post it there.
[02:46:17.775 --> 02:46:21.597]  I spend a lot of my time just calling people up saying, hey, will you tweet this?
[02:46:21.617 --> 02:46:22.598]  Hey, will you Facebook it?
[02:46:22.638 --> 02:46:25.119]  Hey, will you, you know, put your name on it.
[02:46:25.179 --> 02:46:25.599]  I don't care.
[02:46:25.659 --> 02:46:26.600]  Just get it out to people.
[02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:29.481]  You know, take my, take our names off all this.
[02:46:29.761 --> 02:46:30.262]  I don't care.
[02:46:31.653 --> 02:46:33.094]  Just, just, just tell some people.
[02:46:33.114 --> 02:46:36.655]  Of course, the people know you can't go to the store.
[02:46:37.016 --> 02:46:43.459]  We had to go like four stores to find zinc because I sell zinc and I have zinc, but it's in a formula for adults.
[02:46:45.199 --> 02:46:49.822]  And so I wanted, you know, 30 milligram, not, you know, 10 milligram or whatever zinc.
[02:46:51.262 --> 02:46:53.063]  And so I went and got it at the store.
[02:46:53.103 --> 02:46:54.624]  That's what I personally did.
[02:46:55.544 --> 02:46:56.965]  And I did the research.
[02:46:59.111 --> 02:47:05.493]  And most people that have medical degrees, they'll even tell you, they don't even do an hour on minerals in medical school.
[02:47:05.873 --> 02:47:13.775]  I played the head of the UN World Health Organization say, we don't even spend a week in college on vaccine ill effects and we're hurting people and covering it up.
[02:47:14.555 --> 02:47:22.918]  The top of the World Health Organization says in a video, we don't know, we're just told by Bill Gates do this, it's not tested.
[02:47:24.758 --> 02:47:28.039]  I spent five hours the last week probably reading about zinc.
[02:47:29.411 --> 02:47:30.331]  Shut up, Jones!
[02:47:30.351 --> 02:47:32.092]  You don't say a damn thing!
[02:47:33.453 --> 02:47:36.535]  Shut your dirty, filthy, American mouth!
[02:47:37.215 --> 02:47:39.896]  And stay in your damn house while the border stays wide open!
[02:47:40.156 --> 02:47:40.697]  Ya filth!
[02:47:42.397 --> 02:47:43.058]  Well, you know what?
[02:47:43.098 --> 02:47:43.338]  I'm not.
[02:47:44.801 --> 02:47:49.064]  Separately, we fund this operation with the high-quality products we sell.
[02:47:49.824 --> 02:47:53.727]  And the average tap water has over 300 toxic chemicals in it.
[02:47:54.287 --> 02:47:58.630]  The well water has got glyphosate in most areas, MB, all that crap.
[02:47:59.131 --> 02:48:06.776]  We sell Alexa Pure and Pro Pure that are two of the best gravity-fed filters with the highest ratings you're going to find out there for stainless steel gravity-fed filters.
[02:48:06.796 --> 02:48:08.297]  They're right at the top of over 100 brands.
[02:48:08.517 --> 02:48:12.700]  People go, wow, the brand you sell, I checked it on 3rd Party, it's at the very top and it's a great price.
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:13.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:14.461]  I just bring whatever the best is.
[02:48:15.862 --> 02:48:18.223]  We've got those people you need water filtration.
[02:48:19.563 --> 02:48:23.505]  That's how you defend your immunity is not making your body fight all the toxins that are already there.
[02:48:25.106 --> 02:48:27.647]  It's when you're way down with toxins and garbage you get hit by this stuff.
[02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:37.175]  And fluoride is so bad for you, even Harvard admits that now, so get those water filters at infowarestore.com.
[02:48:37.376 --> 02:48:38.577]  We're ready to ship them to you right now.
[02:48:38.997 --> 02:48:41.960]  Food sales, we've stopped because we've got to finish the final orders we have.
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:47.646]  The food system broke down, we can't get more food in, and the minute we couldn't get more food in to finish the orders, we cut the orders off.
[02:48:48.206 --> 02:48:48.947]  Just like we told you.
[02:48:49.808 --> 02:48:51.069]  Straight shooting, just like I said.
[02:48:51.129 --> 02:48:52.651]  That's my superpower is straight shooting.
[02:48:53.631 --> 02:48:54.472]  So damn easy.
[02:48:54.512 --> 02:48:55.373]  No filter, I love it.
[02:48:57.498 --> 02:48:59.580]  Separately, we have the Real Red Pill and the Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:49:00.181 --> 02:49:01.562]  It has Preglanone in it.
[02:49:02.763 --> 02:49:03.664]  Look into what that is.
[02:49:03.684 --> 02:49:05.366]  It's the precursor to all the body's hormones.
[02:49:06.287 --> 02:49:08.128]  For me, it supercharges me just so much.
[02:49:08.949 --> 02:49:09.490]  It's incredible.
[02:49:09.850 --> 02:49:11.091]  I can't even take much of it.
[02:49:11.892 --> 02:49:15.556]  We have it with vitamins and minerals of the highest quality, including your daily allowance of zinc.
[02:49:16.914 --> 02:49:22.218]  All these work synergistically together, and we're going to sell out of this at current rate in less than two weeks.
[02:49:22.459 --> 02:49:23.600]  People have already figured it out.
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:24.961]  It already popped up to a bestseller.
[02:49:25.381 --> 02:49:26.262]  People are looking for zinc.
[02:49:26.302 --> 02:49:27.022]  It's bought up everywhere.
[02:49:27.483 --> 02:49:28.363]  And so I said, you know what?
[02:49:28.624 --> 02:49:31.726]  We're going to sell out in three weeks right now at full price, 50% off.
[02:49:31.766 --> 02:49:32.167]  I'm going.
[02:49:34.224 --> 02:49:37.609]  For a good mojo with the big guy above, this is what I do.
[02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:40.954]  I'm going to go down, even though I said I'm not going to do 50% off this year, because we can't.
[02:49:41.174 --> 02:49:42.136]  Stuff's not marked up that much.
[02:49:42.556 --> 02:49:45.280]  I'm going to 50% off the Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:49:45.581 --> 02:49:48.705]  Real Red Pill Plus has some natural stimulant in it, a bunch of natural caffeine.
[02:49:49.907 --> 02:49:51.868]  I'm going to lower the price 50%.
[02:49:52.148 --> 02:49:52.869]  Total salary of a quarter.
[02:49:53.369 --> 02:49:57.471]  So get your Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:49:57.831 --> 02:49:59.732]  Turmeric is so incredible for your body.
[02:50:00.232 --> 02:50:04.375]  And what it does, we have a turmeric extract bodies with other natural compounds that supercharge it.
[02:50:04.895 --> 02:50:06.276]  I told you this would sell out again.
[02:50:06.696 --> 02:50:10.218]  The 16 ounce did sell out of the Silver Sol Super Silver.
[02:50:11.138 --> 02:50:12.439]  The one-ouncers came back in.
[02:50:12.459 --> 02:50:16.222]  They'll sell out in about four days, no less, in current sales prices.
[02:50:16.402 --> 02:50:19.045]  This is a great thing to also put on your hands and all the rest of it.
[02:50:19.925 --> 02:50:22.267]  So, yes, this one would be topical and that one would be ingested.
[02:50:22.287 --> 02:50:23.048]  You know, they're the same thing.
[02:50:23.408 --> 02:50:25.290]  The government wants you to say that it only does one thing.
[02:50:25.350 --> 02:50:25.890]  Okay, whatever.
[02:50:26.170 --> 02:50:28.692]  This little spray bottle's for topical and the other one's for ingesting.
[02:50:30.013 --> 02:50:31.054]  So, yes, mine's there.
[02:50:31.735 --> 02:50:34.958]  So, all of this is out there and there it is.
[02:50:36.095 --> 02:50:37.356]  Super Silver sold out.
[02:50:37.677 --> 02:50:42.001]  It's the same toothpaste as Super Blue, but Super Blue has tea tree and iodine.
[02:50:42.361 --> 02:50:45.464]  It's just that the Super Silver is a tooth whitener.
[02:50:46.085 --> 02:50:55.014]  People saw the name Silver, so they bought all that up, quite frankly, with the tea tree that's antiviral on record and the iodine that boosts stuff and everything.
[02:50:55.074 --> 02:50:55.534]  It's incredible.
[02:50:56.514 --> 02:51:00.035]  And yes, we have the bubblegum toothpaste combo.
[02:51:00.195 --> 02:51:03.316]  I don't know how that's even still up, because the super silver is sold out.
[02:51:03.676 --> 02:51:08.297]  We do have the super blue bubblegum natural flavor for children with the iodine, chlorosilver, and tea tree.
[02:51:08.317 --> 02:51:10.458]  That is available at Inforrestore.com.
[02:51:10.678 --> 02:51:11.658]  Does that say sold out?
[02:51:11.698 --> 02:51:12.158]  Click on that.
[02:51:12.178 --> 02:51:14.819]  Because I know super silver sold out days ago.
[02:51:15.896 --> 02:51:16.236]  Whatever.
[02:51:16.256 --> 02:51:17.898]  We're working around the clock around here.
[02:51:17.918 --> 02:51:18.659]  It's all insane.
[02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:20.361]  Oh my God.
[02:51:20.381 --> 02:51:22.723]  All right, let's end this with Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[02:51:22.804 --> 02:51:23.664]  I watched it this morning.
[02:51:23.704 --> 02:51:24.345]  It was amazing.
[02:51:25.046 --> 02:51:26.187]  It's a Bandai video.
[02:51:26.468 --> 02:51:28.510]  It's got like a million views on YouTube right now.
[02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:29.311]  What's the name of it?
[02:51:30.131 --> 02:51:30.532]  I forget.
[02:51:34.696 --> 02:51:36.178]  Yeah, you got your thing on overdrive.
[02:51:36.398 --> 02:51:36.879]  Say it again.
[02:51:39.104 --> 02:51:41.186]  All right, idiots react to coronavirus.
[02:51:41.686 --> 02:51:49.332]  Here it is, and then we'll end this live show in about 13 minutes, and then we'll archive this as soon as possible, the same page you're looking at.
[02:51:49.692 --> 02:51:50.632]  Please share this.
[02:51:51.093 --> 02:51:55.356]  It is a life and death situation for our freedoms, our future, our economy, and our very bodies.
[02:51:55.596 --> 02:51:57.037]  And pray for justice and pray for peace.
[02:51:57.357 --> 02:52:00.700]  And remember, nobody came for the 60 million babies we aborted and protected them.
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:02.021]  Nobody panicked for them.
[02:52:02.381 --> 02:52:06.964]  So, if America doesn't turn back to God right now, we're gonna get our asses judged big time.
[02:52:07.865 --> 02:52:08.885]  All right, God bless you all.
[02:52:08.925 --> 02:52:09.565]  Thanks to the crew.
[02:52:09.585 --> 02:52:10.806]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:52:10.826 --> 02:52:11.546]  Who knows how long?
[02:52:11.566 --> 02:52:12.106]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:12.146 --> 02:52:20.028]  with a Sunday transmission.
[02:52:20.048 --> 02:52:26.370]  10,000 plus dead, a quarter of a million infected, entire countries on lockdown, empty shelves, panic buying.
[02:52:26.430 --> 02:52:29.750]  But wait, Trump called it the Chinese virus.
[02:52:29.890 --> 02:52:30.951]  Now we're really mad.
[02:52:30.971 --> 02:52:32.991]  You keep calling this the Chinese virus.
[02:52:33.011 --> 02:52:33.771]  Why do you keep using this?
[02:52:33.811 --> 02:52:34.652]  Because it comes from China.
[02:52:34.672 --> 02:52:35.632]  A lot of people say it's racist.
[02:52:36.292 --> 02:52:37.613]  It's not racist at all, no.
[02:52:37.853 --> 02:52:38.213]  Not at all.
[02:52:38.593 --> 02:52:39.794]  It comes from China.
[02:52:39.874 --> 02:52:41.454]  Make coronavirus Chinese again.
[02:52:41.514 --> 02:52:45.396]  The coronavirus is a Chinese virus, no matter what they're telling you.
[02:52:45.476 --> 02:52:51.919]  It originated in China and was able to spread to the rest of the world because the Chinese government hid the truth of what was happening.
[02:52:53.319 --> 02:53:07.805]  The study published in March indicated that if Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% and its geographic spread limited.
[02:53:08.985 --> 02:53:09.545]  Boohoo!
[02:53:09.586 --> 02:53:10.926]  Stop being mean to China!
[02:53:11.007 --> 02:53:16.951]  China lied to the world two months ago, claiming there was no human-to-human transmission.
[02:53:17.051 --> 02:53:17.511]  Media!
[02:53:17.751 --> 02:53:19.112]  It's not China's fault!
[02:53:19.172 --> 02:53:20.633]  Stop being mean to China!
[02:53:20.733 --> 02:53:31.741]  Chinese laboratories identified a mystery virus as a highly infectious new pathogen by late December last year, but they were ordered to stop tests, destroy samples, and suppress the news.
[02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:32.382]  Media!
[02:53:32.862 --> 02:53:34.125]  It's not China's fault!
[02:53:34.165 --> 02:53:35.428]  Stop being mean to China!
[02:53:35.508 --> 02:53:40.438]  Americans, I'm worried about the health of my family, my job security, making rent and avoiding a recession.
[02:53:40.799 --> 02:53:42.202]  Journalists, okay?
[02:53:42.783 --> 02:53:43.404]  Journalists!
[02:53:44.488 --> 02:53:45.088]  Journalists!
[02:53:45.709 --> 02:53:47.149]  Trump sent China virus again!
[02:53:47.169 --> 02:53:51.691]  The virus was allowed to spread because China covered it up for over a month.
[02:53:51.891 --> 02:54:00.675]  Even as the threat of a global pandemic loomed large, China threatened to withhold medical supplies, which they have a near monopoly over, from the United States.
[02:54:00.775 --> 02:54:06.078]  China's foreign ministry spokesman suggested the US military was to blame for coronavirus.
[02:54:06.318 --> 02:54:10.280]  This claim was then embraced by official Communist Party mouthpieces.
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:10.860]  Media!
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:13.741]  It's Trump's fault, stop being mean to China!
[02:54:13.801 --> 02:54:18.222]  With people calling it the Wuhan flu or the Wuhan virus or the China virus.
[02:54:18.582 --> 02:54:23.344]  This is a virus that came from the territory of China, but came from bats.
[02:54:23.804 --> 02:54:26.965]  This is a bat virus, not a China virus.
[02:54:27.025 --> 02:54:34.808]  Wait, six weeks ago you all said it was racist to say it came from bats, while calling it the Chinese virus.
[02:54:35.268 --> 02:54:37.670]  It's racist to call it the Chinese virus.
[02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:38.210]  Like what?
[02:54:38.330 --> 02:54:41.532]  Next month is it going to be racist to call it the coronavirus?
[02:54:41.653 --> 02:54:48.017]  They're even going back and changing Wikipedia entries about the Spanish flu to try and claim it was never called the Spanish flu.
[02:54:48.197 --> 02:54:52.880]  Still just one coronavirus death in Russia and zero in Singapore.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.662]   Two countries that closed their borders Back in January.
[02:54:56.722 --> 02:55:03.044]  Meanwhile, Germany, Denmark, Canada and numerous other countries are finally closing their borders two months later.
[02:55:03.144 --> 02:55:04.525]  Too little, too late.
[02:55:04.665 --> 02:55:09.046]  Compare the countries that imposed border controls early on to those that didn't.
[02:55:09.266 --> 02:55:11.267]  Open borders spread viruses.
[02:55:11.327 --> 02:55:20.890]  But from the very beginning, the World Health Organization repeatedly ordered countries not to stop the sacred international flow of people.
[02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:28.099]  Coronavirus now in the UK because the relentless mass movement of people is apparently more important than stopping a global pandemic.
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:28.940]  Oh look!
[02:55:29.381 --> 02:55:30.262]  January!
[02:55:30.402 --> 02:55:31.544]  And look where we are now.
[02:55:31.644 --> 02:55:35.428]  People from Italy, Iran and China are still arriving in the UK.
[02:55:35.769 --> 02:55:36.410]  No checks.
[02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:39.551]  Nothing allowed straight in.
[02:55:39.571 --> 02:55:44.153]  90% of the COVID transmission in Seattle is from a single introduction in late January from China.
[02:55:44.394 --> 02:55:48.515]  The New York intro is from Iran, and San Diego intro from Europe.
[02:55:48.596 --> 02:55:52.797]  The infection in Italy spread from two Chinese tourists who visited Rome.
[02:55:52.878 --> 02:55:56.599]  The infection spread in Iran from Chinese migrant laborers.
[02:55:56.739 --> 02:55:58.060]  Thanks, open borders!
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:55:59.100]  A what?
[02:55:59.781 --> 02:56:00.001]  Wow.
[02:56:01.124 --> 02:56:06.567]  Back in February, the Mayor of Florence came up with a brilliant plan to fight coronavirus.
[02:56:06.767 --> 02:56:07.407]  Oh, my bad.
[02:56:07.707 --> 02:56:08.608]  Not the virus.
[02:56:08.828 --> 02:56:13.130]  The racism caused by the virus, which was obviously way more important.
[02:56:13.170 --> 02:56:21.895]  He started a nationwide campaign encouraging Italians to hug Chinese people in the street in order to, quote, stem the hatred.
[02:56:21.975 --> 02:56:27.698]  During one of the stunts to promote the campaign, Italians even physically removed the Chinese man's mask.
[02:56:27.918 --> 02:56:33.105]  The idiot mayor also staged a photo-op of himself hugging an awkward-looking Chinese man.
[02:56:33.185 --> 02:56:33.826]  Plot twist!
[02:56:33.926 --> 02:56:37.391]  Now Italy has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the entire world.
[02:56:37.491 --> 02:56:43.459]  They'll show this video to children in the future in history class about how political correctness killed an entire country.
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:44.661]  Now they're not racist.
[02:56:45.422 --> 02:56:46.242]  Because they're dead.
[02:56:46.323 --> 02:56:48.524]  The streets of Florence are now deserted.
[02:56:48.924 --> 02:56:51.525]  Italy is under martial law lockdown.
[02:56:51.765 --> 02:56:53.966]  But racism BTFO!
[02:56:54.087 --> 02:56:57.288]  Trudeau condemns racism linked to coronavirus outbreak.
[02:56:57.328 --> 02:56:58.129]  Let me be clear.
[02:56:58.769 --> 02:57:04.692]  There is no place in our country for discrimination driven by fear or misinformation.
[02:57:05.171 --> 02:57:09.010]  This is not something Canadians will ever stand for.
[02:57:09.010 --> 02:57:16.510]  [Music]
[02:57:16.510 --> 02:57:21.171]   Many of the migrants we already brought in are completely ignoring orders to stay indoors.
[02:57:21.321 --> 02:57:22.502]  Others are doing this.
[02:57:25.844 --> 02:57:31.388]  Others reacted to being put under quarantine by waving ISIS flags and trying to burn down their own refugee camps.
[02:57:31.247 --> 02:57:36.608]   and London's more diverse areas aren't really practicing good social distancing.
[02:57:36.608 --> 02:57:37.727]  Oh my god!
[02:57:37.727 --> 02:57:40.368]  Oh s***, oh s***, oh s***, oh s***!
[02:57:40.368 --> 02:57:42.686]  Oi, we just want to get our cereal!
[02:57:42.686 --> 02:57:43.967]  We just want milk!
[02:57:43.967 --> 02:57:44.926]  Oh my god!
[02:57:44.926 --> 02:57:50.047]  I'm literally hungry!
[02:57:50.047 --> 02:57:57.039]   #DiversityIsAStrength Celebrities and social media influencers are some of the worst impacted by the coronavirus.
[02:57:57.139 --> 02:58:01.660]  Not because they've got coronavirus, but because they're not getting enough attention.
[02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:06.861]  Sam Smith is crying because he's had to self-isolate in his £12 million mansion.
[02:58:07.161 --> 02:58:08.042]  Poor baby!
[02:58:08.062 --> 02:58:15.003]  There's also this weird kind of Covid signalling where people seem overly keen to claim that they've got the virus.
[02:58:15.183 --> 02:58:19.326]  Catching a dangerous virus and then bragging about it doesn't make you hard.
[02:58:19.566 --> 02:58:21.147]  It makes you a f***ing idiot.
[02:58:21.187 --> 02:58:24.509]  But not as much of an idiot as this future Darwin Award winner.
[02:58:24.649 --> 02:58:25.630]  Corona time.
[02:58:27.091 --> 02:58:28.752]  Hey, it's Corona time right now.
[02:58:29.685 --> 02:58:34.206]  Coronavirus Challenge, which involves licking a toilet seat or a doorknob.
[02:58:34.346 --> 02:58:36.106]  Coronavirus BTFO!
[02:58:36.166 --> 02:58:39.747]  That's like trying to defeat the spread of Hepatitis A by literally eating s***.
[02:58:40.547 --> 02:58:43.148]  Some celebrities sang John Lennon's Imagine.
[02:58:43.268 --> 02:58:51.329]  Imagine all the people living for today.
[02:58:51.389 --> 02:58:52.870]  Coronavirus BTFO!
[02:58:52.890 --> 02:58:58.311]  The irony of singing a song about open borders after a disease has killed thousands of people.
[02:58:59.369 --> 02:59:00.430]  Because of open borders.
[02:59:00.470 --> 02:59:06.293]  Hindu activists in the Indian capital of New Delhi held a party to celebrate finding a COVID cure.
[02:59:06.353 --> 02:59:09.354]  The cure is to drink cow piss.
[02:59:09.454 --> 02:59:10.775]  Coronavirus BTFO.
[02:59:10.875 --> 02:59:20.600]  Millennials and college students reacted to desperate pleas to practice social distancing and avoid congregating in large groups by socializing in congregations of large groups.
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:22.260]  If I get corona, I get corona.
[02:59:22.540 --> 02:59:24.761]  At the end of the day, I'm not gonna let it stop me from partying.
[02:59:24.781 --> 02:59:26.761]  Like, it's really messing up with my spring break.
[02:59:26.801 --> 02:59:28.202]  This virus ain't that serious.
[02:59:28.342 --> 02:59:30.642]  Get drunk before everything closes!
[02:59:31.002 --> 02:59:32.202]  We having day parties all day.
[02:59:32.282 --> 02:59:34.083]  We're just living for the moment.
[02:59:34.103 --> 02:59:36.103]  City and country-wide quarantines?
[02:59:36.123 --> 02:59:37.023]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[02:59:37.043 --> 02:59:40.044]  But to be fair, adults are working from home.
[02:59:40.244 --> 02:59:42.664]  No, they're congregating in huge numbers at the beach.
[02:59:42.904 --> 02:59:45.965]  Teenagers are avoiding universities to get drunk at St.
[02:59:45.985 --> 02:59:47.085]  Patrick's Day parties.
[02:59:47.145 --> 02:59:50.386]  You worried that gatherings like this will potentially spread the virus?
[02:59:50.626 --> 02:59:51.426]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:59:51.686 --> 02:59:52.387]  I'm not worried.
[02:59:52.507 --> 02:59:53.407]  I know it will.
[02:59:53.447 --> 02:59:59.109]  Like, it's not like... Like, it's not... It's not a question.
[02:59:59.209 --> 03:00:02.129]  It's not a question, because it will definitely spread the disease.
[03:00:02.209 --> 03:00:05.130]  I have a compromised immune system, but I'm still only 21.
[03:00:05.591 --> 03:00:10.772]  But I'm not even worried, because I just take supplements, and, like, I self-medicate, so it's fine.
[03:00:10.912 --> 03:00:12.793]  This calls for drastic measures.
[03:00:13.833 --> 03:00:15.594]  You don't want to stay?
[03:00:15.493 --> 03:00:19.493]   *laughs* Is that what he's saying?
[03:00:19.493 --> 03:00:21.493]  Is that what he's saying?
[03:00:21.493 --> 03:00:25.493]   *music* *beep*
[03:00:25.493 --> 03:00:29.493]   Meanwhile in Benidorm It says there's a flu that we just all need to get over
[03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:31.140]  Have a beer.
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:32.220]  Happy days.
[03:00:32.401 --> 03:00:33.941]  Barry Stanton, is that you?
[03:00:34.121 --> 03:00:36.682]  Eco-mentalists are absolutely loving it.
[03:00:36.762 --> 03:00:40.144]  Citizens of Wuhan can finally hear birds chirping after years.
[03:00:40.424 --> 03:00:42.605]  Venice's water canals are clear and full of fish.
[03:00:42.885 --> 03:00:47.167]  And you can even see the Tatra Mountains from Krakow because the smog has lifted.
[03:00:47.447 --> 03:00:48.828]  This isn't an apocalypse.
[03:00:49.508 --> 03:00:51.309]  It's an awakening.
[03:00:51.329 --> 03:00:53.290]  300,000 likes.
[03:00:53.370 --> 03:01:00.212]  You've just watched your parents die an agonising death in front of your face, but hey, at least you can hear the birds chirping.
[03:01:00.152 --> 03:01:04.951]   Billie Eilish pleaded with her fans to practice social distancing to stop coronavirus
[03:01:04.951 --> 03:01:09.352]   the day after she performed a concert to thousands of people and did this.
[03:01:09.352 --> 03:01:23.351]  [crowd cheering]
[03:01:23.351 --> 03:01:28.051]   What upset a lot of Americans more than the potential of millions of dead Americans
[03:01:28.051 --> 03:01:32.492]   was the possibility that their favourite sports ball tournament might get cancelled.
[03:01:32.538 --> 03:01:36.021]  Today should have been a day of college basketball games and a few cold beers.
[03:01:36.141 --> 03:01:37.742]  Instead, coronavirus stole it.
[03:01:37.983 --> 03:01:41.786]  Imagine explaining to a D-Day veteran that sports were cancelled because of a virus.
[03:01:41.946 --> 03:01:48.132]  Imagine explaining to that same veteran that you're whining on Twitter about not being able to watch a basketball game on TV.
[03:01:48.212 --> 03:01:56.259]  But surely the biggest casualty of coronavirus in terms of postponed events was the cancellation of Drag Queen Storytime.
[03:01:57.409 --> 03:01:58.029]  Every cloud.
[03:01:59.450 --> 03:02:05.052]  The stock market's totally collapsed!
[03:02:05.312 --> 03:02:07.633]  No, not my stockerinos!
[03:02:07.893 --> 03:02:08.894]  Wee, big lingo down.
[03:02:08.914 --> 03:02:18.778]  Which aside from Wall Street multimillionaires and billionaires who'll probably be okay, could lead to retirement funds being wiped out, small businesses destroyed, global depression and massive unemployment.
[03:02:18.838 --> 03:02:22.720]  But according to leftists who are celebrating, that's okay.
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:25.001]  Because Orange Man bad.
[03:02:25.101 --> 03:02:28.683]  Cringe Conservative Inc isn't reacting much better.
[03:02:28.783 --> 03:02:30.785]  Shutting down private businesses is overreach.
[03:02:30.825 --> 03:02:33.386]  Shutting down restaurants in a city of 4 million people is criminal.
[03:02:33.546 --> 03:02:37.068]  There are hundreds of thousands of people who don't have food at home, who don't know how to cook.
[03:02:37.409 --> 03:02:39.450]  Grocery stores aren't built to feed 100% of us 100% of the time.
[03:02:39.470 --> 03:02:39.610]  Okay.
[03:02:42.532 --> 03:02:44.515]  Drive-thru and Uber Eats cannot make up the difference.
[03:02:44.735 --> 03:02:47.779]  People will not comply with this tyrannical s**t once they get hungry.
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:48.801]  Insanity!
[03:02:48.921 --> 03:02:50.883]  No, not the hecking Restorinos.
[03:02:50.923 --> 03:02:52.365]  I need my overpriced bugs.
[03:02:52.425 --> 03:02:53.667]  I can't survive on my own.
[03:02:53.747 --> 03:02:55.009]  No!
[03:02:55.089 --> 03:02:58.814]  Don't panic, say all the big city LA and New York conservatives.
[03:02:58.874 --> 03:03:02.955]  Who are panicking because their favourite lobster restaurants are closing and they can't cook.
[03:03:03.035 --> 03:03:11.498]  These are the same conservatives who quietly support mass immigration because they need cheap foreign labour ethnic minorities to prepare all their food.
[03:03:11.658 --> 03:03:13.198]  Total man babies.
[03:03:13.318 --> 03:03:16.099]  Only a complete idiot wouldn't have any food at home.
[03:03:16.339 --> 03:03:24.801]  All these rugged individualist conservatives don't seem to be very rugged or individualist if they're one missed gourmet meal away from wetting the bed.
[03:03:24.981 --> 03:03:26.882]  Coronavirus is a huge threat.
[03:03:27.102 --> 03:03:32.509]  So cover your face when you go outside, don't shake hands with anyone, stay at home as much as you can, go outside only when needed.
[03:03:32.609 --> 03:03:34.792]  And this will help prevent the spread of coronavirus?
[03:03:34.932 --> 03:03:35.974]  Her coronavirus?
[03:03:36.154 --> 03:03:37.636]  The it's just the flu!
[03:03:37.796 --> 03:03:39.839]  Bros have been totally embarrassed.
[03:03:40.159 --> 03:03:41.661]  It will go away, just stay calm.
[03:03:41.681 --> 03:03:43.043]  But let's not be too defeatist.
[03:03:43.183 --> 03:03:47.906]  At least for the time being, both China and South Korea appear to have beaten it back.
[03:03:48.006 --> 03:03:50.027]  Their cases are declining day after day.
[03:03:50.128 --> 03:03:52.649]  China is somewhat getting back to normal.
[03:03:52.729 --> 03:03:54.470]  The situation is not hopeless.
[03:03:54.570 --> 03:03:58.293]  Which makes all the drama queens on Twitter all the more annoying.
[03:03:58.553 --> 03:04:02.096]  Yeah, it's pretty bad, but it's not comparable to a world war.
[03:04:02.176 --> 03:04:06.060]  You're being asked to wash your hands, sit on your sofa and watch Netflix.
[03:04:06.180 --> 03:04:11.564]  You're not being asked to storm the beaches of Normandy under bombardment from a Nazi war machine.
[03:04:11.665 --> 03:04:16.529]  You're not being asked to live under the constant fear of having your house bombed to s*** every f***ing day.
[03:04:17.350 --> 03:04:22.315]  So shut the f*** up and stop making the panic worse than the actual virus itself.
[03:04:22.575 --> 03:04:28.781]  And for God's sake, can we focus on what matters while fighting a deadly global pandemic?
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:33.680]  Can we just shut up about racism for five f***ing minutes?
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:05:00.680]  [Music]
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:11.000]   Well there's now a craze, a phenomenon of sanitizing your hands.
[03:05:10.989 --> 03:05:11.709]  Sanitize.
[03:05:11.949 --> 03:05:13.630]  You touch something, sanitize.
[03:05:14.390 --> 03:05:16.191]  You touch this, you touch that, you leave the house.
[03:05:16.371 --> 03:05:21.153]  You scratch your head, you comb your hair, you brush your teeth.
[03:05:21.173 --> 03:05:24.994]  You switch living room to bathroom to kitchen.
[03:05:25.694 --> 03:05:26.975]  Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize.
[03:05:28.168 --> 03:05:31.212]  Well, there is something about sanitizing your hands that I've noticed.
[03:05:31.813 --> 03:05:32.674]  It dries them out.
[03:05:32.694 --> 03:05:35.898]  And you get these dry hands.
[03:05:37.780 --> 03:05:42.306]  So during quarantine, you may want to be holding somebody's hand, holding your boo's hand.
[03:05:43.087 --> 03:05:44.089]  Got these dry hands.
[03:05:44.649 --> 03:05:45.010]  Not good.
[03:05:46.325 --> 03:05:48.306]  We have the solution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:48.586 --> 03:05:52.428]  Do you have dry hands from all the hand sanitizing that's going around?

[03:06:24.947 --> 03:06:26.188]  The best grapefruit scent.
[03:06:26.288 --> 03:06:26.869]  It's the best.

[03:06:35.535 --> 03:06:39.358]  Have you completely exhausted the surface of your hands from any moisture at all?
[03:06:40.162 --> 03:06:41.442]  Nobody wants to touch that hand.
[03:06:42.923 --> 03:06:44.863]  Not even your own boo.
[03:06:45.683 --> 03:06:47.863]  You don't want to pet your dog with that dry hand.
[03:06:48.544 --> 03:06:49.044]  That's rude.
[03:06:49.344 --> 03:06:50.184]  That's animal abuse.
[03:06:50.724 --> 03:06:51.824]  Stop abusing your pets.
[03:06:51.904 --> 03:06:54.805]  Get some Super Silver Skin Cream from InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:06:55.365 --> 03:06:56.065]  That's what I'm doing.
[03:06:55.884 --> 03:07:16.763]  doing.
[03:07:16.902 --> 03:07:17.802]  We're about a day behind.
[03:07:17.822 --> 03:07:20.363]  So you order today, we will be shipping to you on Friday.
[03:07:20.964 --> 03:07:31.168]  But I'm just going to tell you, with what I've been told and what I've learned from executives that are at big companies, they're being told that if we accept the continued lockdown, they're going to go to total lockdown soon.
[03:07:32.328 --> 03:07:33.349]  And just see what happens.
[03:07:34.709 --> 03:07:35.530]  This is insane.
[03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:39.331]  And I hope Trump realizes he's being set up with an over-response.
[03:07:39.431 --> 03:07:40.352]  An under-response is bad.
[03:07:40.372 --> 03:07:41.592]  An over-response is bad as well.
[03:07:41.712 --> 03:07:43.113]  We've got to be balanced about this.
[03:07:43.273 --> 03:07:54.858]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, get the boost you and your family need, with Living Defense now back in stock, sold out for four months, and the Krill Oil now back in stock, and the X2 and the X3, and the Super Silver toothpaste is sold out.
[03:07:54.998 --> 03:07:57.659]  Super Blue has the same amount of Nano Silver in it.
[03:07:57.719 --> 03:08:00.440]  It has Tea Tree Oil, which is so good for so many things.
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:04.163]   Look into that, and we've got the Ultimate turmeric formula bodies back in stock.
[03:08:04.263 --> 03:08:07.466]  We've got the 1 ounce immune gargle sold out for a month.
[03:08:07.666 --> 03:08:09.568]  It's back in stock and it's 20% off.
[03:08:09.588 --> 03:08:11.169]  We're about to sell out of the 16 ounce.
[03:08:11.209 --> 03:08:13.171]  I don't know when we're going to be getting that back in.
[03:08:13.191 --> 03:08:14.572]  That is going to sell out any day now.
[03:08:14.793 --> 03:08:15.834]  But a lot of stuff's selling out.
[03:08:15.854 --> 03:08:16.574]  A lot of stuff's coming in.
[03:08:16.654 --> 03:08:17.895]  But we're talking to our supply chain.
[03:08:17.915 --> 03:08:19.177]  They're saying, we don't know.
[03:08:19.217 --> 03:08:21.439]  Just like I told you a month ago, they may suspend food sales.
[03:08:21.779 --> 03:08:22.920]  We suspended food sales yesterday.
[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:24.201]  Everybody else is sold out.
[03:08:24.221 --> 03:08:24.642]  They're lying.
[03:08:24.662 --> 03:08:25.303]  They're taking your money.
[03:08:25.343 --> 03:08:25.743]  It's criminal.
[03:08:25.903 --> 03:08:28.226]  I don't know how you take somebody's money and don't have food to ship them.
[03:08:28.487 --> 03:08:29.948]  The food you ordered, most of you got it.
[03:08:29.969 --> 03:08:30.910]  The others, it's coming.
[03:08:31.330 --> 03:08:34.014]  But they're worried about the future, so we made the decision.
[03:08:34.294 --> 03:08:35.736]  We're not selling food anymore, okay?
[03:08:36.056 --> 03:08:38.339]  Because we can't guarantee new orders are gonna get it.
[03:08:38.559 --> 03:08:39.500]  Same thing with supplements.
[03:08:39.540 --> 03:08:40.620]  We have the supplements now.
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:41.821]  We have the products now.

[03:08:43.321 --> 03:08:53.506]  You better get your orders in because these type of products in a crisis like this are the most important thing out there other than the relationship with God and guns and ammo and food and willing to fight.
[03:08:53.866 --> 03:08:54.887]  Get your supplements now.
