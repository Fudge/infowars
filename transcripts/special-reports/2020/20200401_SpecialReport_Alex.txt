[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  [Music]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   In 2005, the Wachowski brothers produced the archetypal film V for Vendetta.
[00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:36.705]  And with almost prescient vision, they predicted what is unfolding in the year 2020.
[00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:44.562]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure.
[00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:48.945]  If your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[00:00:49.325 --> 00:01:05.692]   A newly elected government seeking power and control develops a secret bioweapon and launches it against its own population to establish authoritarian rule and to blame the attack on their political enemies.
[00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:25.241]   Taking pages right out of the 20th century we see this fictional dictatorship not just seeking to dominate and control the population but to be seen as saviors of the very people that they are dumbing down Enslaving, imprisoning, and killing.
[00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:32.267]  The writers had a deep historical well to work from in just the 20th century.
[00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:52.163]   With monsters like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong Un, Who don't just seek to dominate and control the very lives and thoughts of their minions, but who also want to be seen as the savior by the very people who are their slaves.
[00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:58.069]  Tonight I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to them.
[00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.294]  The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.
[00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:07.719]  What we need right now is a clear message to the people of this country.
[00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.405]  This message must be read in every newspaper, heard on every radio, seen on every television.
[00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.569]  This message must resound throughout the entire interlink!
[00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.213]  I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
[00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:26.338]  I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.
[00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:31.003]  I want everyone to remember why they need us!
[00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:36.388]  In the former United States, civil war continues to devastate the Midwest.
[00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:40.729]  Scientists attribute this latest water shortage to the lack of rainfall the last two years.
[00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.270]  Ministry officials expect water coupon prices to rise.
[00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.231]  Police have arrested nine suspects.
[00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:47.231]  Can you believe this?
[00:02:47.652 --> 00:02:49.132]  Recording avian flu vaccine.
[00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:50.012]  We've gone on all summer.
[00:02:50.152 --> 00:02:53.474]  Outside the quarantine zone, a new airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.
[00:02:54.654 --> 00:03:03.126]  So of course in the film, those that release the bioweapon on their own population that they're preying on also have the cure.
[00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:15.615]  Some believed it was the work of God himself, that it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich.
[00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:21.199]  But the end result, the true genius of the plan, was the fear.
[00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:28.966]  Fear became the ultimate tool of this government, and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor.
[00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:34.129]  In V for Vendetta, we truly see art imitating life.
[00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:40.894]  But when you fast forward to the year 2019 and then 2020, it's not the U.S.
[00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.335]  government that has its fingerprints all over this.
[00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:50.100]  It's the private, corporate, global government and their testing ground, the communist Chinese super state.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.206]  Top scientists from across the world in India and Europe and other areas all came out early on and said, this is clearly a man-made coronavirus.
[00:03:59.647 --> 00:04:05.413]  This is clearly an offensive biological warfare agent.
[00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:08.677]  From the beginning of the entire event was carefully coordinated.
[00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:24.025]  Two years ago, the United Nations announces that disease X will soon arrive and that global government will be needed to counter the international crisis and that basic human liberties will have to be permanently erased in the name of global health.
[00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:42.423]   And then in the fall of 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holds event 201, where 65 million people die from a Corona-like virus And the answer is quarantines, lockdowns, forced inoculations, robot drone enforcement, and of course, world government.
[00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:47.387]  From the beginning, the entire event was carefully choreographed.
[00:04:48.067 --> 00:05:01.791]  A man-made virus designed to not just attack four different parts of the body, including male fertility and the lungs, but where did filmmakers like the Wachowski brothers get the idea for their script?
[00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:02.731]  In history.
[00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:08.030]  a bio-attack pointed at the population to enslave them.
[00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.030]   Certainly the Wachowski brothers produced a vivid and rich film that is a masterpiece.
[00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.311]   But they weren't the first people in Hollywood or in popular culture to notice what was going
[00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:21.350]  on in official white papers I'll get to in a moment.
[00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.711]   Back in 1993, the Simpsons, known for being prescient or being on the inside, had a whole
[00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:30.031]  episode about a controlled bio-weapon.
[00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:33.790]   We are here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where
[00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.911]  they belong in dark rooms glued to their...
[00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:37.837]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:05:38.016 --> 00:05:39.016]  Well, I think...
[00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:42.016]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:45.016]   I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health care.
[00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:46.016]  Yeah.
[00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:48.016]  A new disease. No one's immune.
[00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:51.016]   It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.016]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:56.016]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[00:05:56.016 --> 00:06:00.016]   The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:02.016]  Where are they getting these ideas?
[00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:06.016]  Well, it turns out it goes back to Malthus.
[00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:12.016]  More than 250 years ago in England, who coined the term "Malthusianism".
[00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:19.016]   Where the elite believes that they should release bio-weapons or plagues on the population to reduce their numbers.
[00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:22.878]  But Malthus is not the father of eugenics.
[00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:33.250]  The father of eugenics is Plato, who over 2,000 years ago in his Republic wrote about herding the poor into compact cities and releasing plagues upon them.
[00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:36.094]  So where is popular culture getting its cue?
[00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:44.263]   Well, from the Club of Rome and Public documents they put out in the 1960s calling for global forced depopulation.
[00:06:44.624 --> 00:06:55.636]  And of course we have folks like Prince Philip, Prince Charles' father, Queen Elizabeth's husband constantly in interviews saying he wants to come back as a deadly virus reincarnated to exterminate humanity.
[00:06:55.876 --> 00:07:02.948]  In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.677]  Prince Philip, reported by Deutsche Presse-Agentur DPA, August, 1988.
[00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:20.581]  You see, Bill Gates and Ted Turner and Warren Buffett and people like Oprah Winfrey, when they meet to discuss depopulation and world government, they're celebrated as wonderful, good people.
[00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:31.630]  When Bill Gates talks about getting rid of old people, death panels, so we all, quote, have more money, or Newsweek talks about the case for killing Granny... That's called the death panel.
[00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.112]  Uh, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:40.297]  Well, he's a savior when he puts up equations about reducing the human numbers down to zero to save the earth.
[00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.399]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.723]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's, let's take a look.
[00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:53.507]  And he's following the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Endowment plan that's over 120 years old.
[00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:03.958]  In 2010, the Rockefeller Foundation put out a lengthy white paper that's public, and I suggest you go read it, called Lockstep.
[00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:12.747]  And it predicts an authoritarian world government will rise and crush the general public in the name of security and safety.
[00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:27.016]  And now former British Prime Ministers and others are openly saying world government, a technocracy, an authoritarian rule of autocrats is the only thing that will keep humanity and our precious old people safe.
[00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:31.579]  But these are the very same individuals saying we should get rid of the old people.
[00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:41.647]  It was Benjamin Franklin that said, those that will give up their liberties for security deserve and will get neither.
[00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:44.410]  Meaning, you always get enslaved.
[00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.573]  When you behave like a sheep, wolves come.
[00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:59.519]   And if you study who's running this whole pandemic hysteria, It is known eugenicists that publicly say they want to reduce world population to at least 500 million.
[00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:06.181]  These people are hyper predators and it is all about raw power and control.
[00:09:06.861 --> 00:09:16.484]  And as soon as we start recognizing these spiders for what they are, dangerous anti-human authoritarians and not saviors, the sooner we can turn our civilization around.
[00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:23.567]   So when you see the incredible fear in the media of this virus that is a real bioweapon, remember The endgame is here.
[00:09:24.088 --> 00:09:25.169]  Locking you up in your homes.
[00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:26.731]  Surveilling you with drones.
[00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.834]  Not letting you leave your house unless you have the right app on your phone.
[00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:34.099]  Total, absolute, big brother AI enslavement.
[00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:37.183]  The good news is humanity is awakening right now.
[00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:52.047]  To the fact that it is the corrupt corporations and major globalist institutions like the World Health Organization and the CHICOMS that have all these level 4 bioweapons labs that are developing the very pathogens that now plague humanity.
[00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:54.308]  Life is not imitating art in 2020.
[00:09:55.888 --> 00:10:06.075]  The Wachowski Brothers and many others like Chris Carter and the X-Files were only telegraphing to you what they were experiencing at elite meetings around the world.
[00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:25.828]  Bill Joy in 1999, one of the co-founders of Sun Microsystems and a major billionaire, warned the world in an article titled, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, that he'd gone to an elite meeting of top billionaires in Silicon Valley and that they had a consensus agreement to bring in world government and exterminate the majority of the world population.
[00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:36.697]  14 years ago I laid out the globalist plan from their own statements and predicted by the year 2020 they would begin executing their depopulation operation.
[00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:53.951]  This is only the beginning to train you to be locked down so in the future when the really deadly bioweapons are released and billions begin dying you sit there believing governments and corporations are actually your savior and are going to shepherd you and protect you when in truth they're Judas goats leading you into the slaughter.
[00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:16.370]  I'm Alex Jones, and you have been warned.
[00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:17.321]  Thanks for calling.
[00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:18.541]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:18.922]  Thank you.
[00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:20.282]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:28.165]  If I may plug first, I want to thank you about one of your products that I've been using myself for a while, and it's been quite amazing.
[00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:35.487]  It's BODY EASE, and I destroy basically one of my wrists in my, what's it called, training martial arts practice.
[00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:37.448]  You're doing martial arts and hurt your wrist?
[00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:39.930]  Yeah, and the body was amazing.
[00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.811]  I recovered within three weeks.
[00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:48.516]  And my mom was recently diagnosed with arthritis, and she's been having knee pains for years.
[00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:50.938]  And her body was just amazing.
[00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:55.061]  And she told me very recently that she simply doesn't feel pain anymore in her knees.
[00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.345]  I mean, it doesn't feel as good as new, but it doesn't feel painful either.
[00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:02.087]  She just got rid of all of that, and I really want to thank you.
[00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:05.049]  Well, it works for me better than Advil, but it does take a few days to build up.
[00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:06.110]  It doesn't work right away.
[00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.832]  And my wife, I told the story like about a year ago, she would have hip surgery.
[00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:13.333]  Her hip hurt so bad from playing tennis competitively for so long.
[00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:19.096]  And she goes, wait a minute, these turmeric pills are like twice as big and strong as yours, but yours works better.
[00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:22.877]  And I said, honey, because the FDA makes you just call it turmeric.
[00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:27.499]  We have an expensive turmeric extract, the strongest one that we could find.
[00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.260]  It's certified.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.041]  So it says turmeric on the bottle, but it's not turmeric.
[00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:33.242]  It's a turmeric or cuminoid extract.
[00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:35.503]  And so that's why bodies, it works really good.
[00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:36.804]  Yeah, most definitely.
[00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.725]  And all of your other products are very amazing.
