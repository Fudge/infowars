[00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:10.786]  I guess the best way to describe this is when we began our representation of the president, we certainly were confronted with a very anomalous set of results.
[00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:16.887]  The president way ahead on election night, seven or eight hundred thousand in Pennsylvania.
[00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:19.908]  Somehow he lost Pennsylvania.
[00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.410]  We have statisticians willing to testify that that's almost statistically impossible to have happened in the period of time that it happened.
[00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.851]  But of course, that's just speculation.
[00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:41.642]  As we started investigating, both our investigations and the very patriotic and brave American citizens that have come forward are extraordinary.
[00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.203]  Extraordinary number of people.
[00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:44.944]  Extraordinary number of witnesses.
[00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.927]  And what emerged very quickly is, this is not a singular voter fraud in one state.
[00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.509]  This pattern repeats itself in a number of states.
[00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:56.970]  Almost exactly the same pattern.
[00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:15.531]  Which, to any experienced investigator, prosecutor, would suggest that there was a plan from a centralized place to execute these various acts of voter fraud, specifically focused on big cities.
[00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:23.014]  And specifically focused on, as you would imagine, big cities controlled by Democrats.
[00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:25.335]  These people are under penalty of perjury.
[00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:26.936]  Their names are on an affidavit.
[00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:33.903]  They swear that they weren't allowed to carry out their function as inspectors.
[00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:36.004]  And it's not just a technical thing.
[00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.545]  There's a reason they did it.
[00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:40.447]  And again, folks, it's not just that they swear it.
[00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:50.394]  We have video in Michigan, video in Wisconsin, video in Georgia, video in Pennsylvania of them boarding up the windows and assaulting people and throwing them out in violation of law.
[00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:51.115]  Continue.
[00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.978]  You were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[00:01:57.248 --> 00:01:59.050]  And you had a big road ahead of you.
[00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.274]  You had to catch him up for 700,000 to 800,000 votes that he was behind.
[00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:08.879]  And the only way you were going to do it was with the mail-in ballots.
[00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.182]  You couldn't have a Democrat and Republican inspector around.
[00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:15.084]  They don't even have Democrats watching.
[00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.144]   Because they'd be afraid that they'd be honest Democrats who would say, "You're cheating!"
[00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:25.144]  [Siren]
[00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:28.144]  Thank you for joining us on this November 19th Global Transmission.
[00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:29.076]  It is Thursday.
[00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.776]  Owen Schroer is in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.196]  He'll be hosting most of the transmission.
[00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:39.058]  But I'll be back in the fourth hour today with Jay Dyer in studio, Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander.
[00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:46.519]  Here in about 45 minutes, I'm going to go back down to the Georgia Capitol, where they've been finding massive evidence of fraud in this election.
[00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.900]  Ballots hidden, and in every case, the ballots flip back.
[00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.127]  To Trump, not to Biden.
[00:02:52.327 --> 00:03:00.519]  And Giuliani, Rulof Giuliani, the White House's chief lawyer, is set to hold a path to victory press conference any minute.
[00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:10.308]  And as soon as that begins to take place, we will go live to it with Owen Schroeder.
[00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.089]  But I want listeners to understand something.
[00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.270]  We have some particularly massive news here.
[00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.330]  Folks know that we're next year's news today, okay?
[00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.170]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.672]  I've really been focusing, historically and currently, and looking into the future, on what needs to be done, and I have a plan.
[00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:35.337]  And if you want to get out of the straitjacket, if you want to get out of being a slave, it needs to be done right now.
[00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:36.798]  Okay?
[00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:40.041]  We have to start resisting and speaking out, getting very, very aggressive right now.
[00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:51.470]  We have to call out the people behind this, the people who orchestrated this, the fact that it's an organized criminal fraud to put the whole world into more debt and to put the middle class into debt to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:57.776]  That the very central banks are bragging and putting out business perspectives on how much money they're going to make out of this.
[00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:06.439]  Just like when they would put in a government in Greece and plunge their economy, all the private jets would land coming in, buying up the private islands for themselves.
[00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:19.010]  We are being put into cardiac arrest financially so they can buy everything up, pennies on the dollar, bring in a cashless society, a medical tyranny, tracking system, social credit score.
[00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.611]  This is the big move.
[00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:24.074]  Everything from this point on just accelerates at light speed.
[00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:25.476]  I likened it last night.
[00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:38.710]  On a very successful Twitter periscope feed that I did with Ali Alexander had a couple hundred thousand people on it watching, as of last night, who knows what it is today, about climbing a mountain and you get to a mountain peak and it's a cliff.
[00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.811]  It took you a long time, you know, days to climb it.
[00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:46.594]  But when you jump off it and fall 10,000 feet, it just takes a minute or so to hit the bottom.
[00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.234]  We are in free fall now.
[00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:54.638]  Now we have a parachute that's called God and it's called us getting active and it's called us declaring our own independence and not complying.
[00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:58.819]  We're about a third of the way falling right now, and we're falling fast.
[00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.079]  So this is very, very serious.
[00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.460]  Owen Schroer, everything coming to a head, everything out in the open now.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400]  The enemy had to emerge at a certain point, and boy, are they not making their move, Owen.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.082]  And Alex, it's so hard to decide what to have your focus on, what to keep your eye on, you know, what ball to follow, the bouncing balls.
[00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:23.583]  Is it the COVID hoax worldwide to establish a world government?
[00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:25.283]  Is it the complete theft?
[00:05:25.683 --> 00:05:33.688]  The complete rig of our elections that we have to fight to, and we're trying to fight both of these beasts, and the average American doesn't even see them.
[00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:41.092]  They don't even know that it's going on, and so we're here trying to get them to engage in this battle with us, and they can't even see the elephant in the room.
[00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:46.416]  It does appear that Trump's lawyers are now entering the press conference right now, Alex.
[00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:47.676]  The cameras have turned around.
[00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:56.901]   So let's go live in Washington, D.C., the Republican National Committee Center there as Trump's legal team is coming out.
[00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:57.582]  You can see Alex.
[00:05:57.602 --> 00:06:34.123]   They have a little board there You have Rudy Giuliani you have Sidney Powell you have Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani looks like he is going to lead us off And thank you very much for coming this is Representative of our legal team we're representing President Trump and we're representing the Trump campaign When I finish Sidney Powell and then Jenna Ellis will follow me and we will present, in brief, the evidence that we've collected over the last, I guess it is two weeks.
[00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:39.106]  Also Joseph Jennefer, Victoria Tenzing are here with me.
[00:06:40.107 --> 00:06:46.050]  There are a lot more lawyers working on this but we're the, I guess we're the senior lawyers.
[00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:48.891]  And Boris Epstein.
[00:06:51.747 --> 00:07:01.930]  I guess the best way to describe this is when we began our representation of the president, we certainly were confronted with a very anomalous set of results.
[00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.031]  The president way ahead on election night, seven or eight hundred thousand in Pennsylvania.
[00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.052]  Somehow he lost Pennsylvania.
[00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:18.554]  We have statisticians willing to testify that that's almost statistically impossible to have happened in the period of time that it happened.
[00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:20.995]  But of course, that's just speculation.
[00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:32.785]  As we started investigating, both our investigations and the very patriotic and brave American citizens that have come forward are extraordinary.
[00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:34.346]  Extraordinary number of people.
[00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:36.087]  Extraordinary number of witnesses.
[00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:42.070]  And what emerged very quickly is, this is not a singular voter fraud in one state.
[00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:45.673]  This pattern repeats itself in a number of states.
[00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:48.134]  Almost exactly the same pattern.
[00:07:49.068 --> 00:08:06.680]  Which, to any experienced investigator, prosecutor, would suggest that there was a plan from a centralized place to execute these various acts of voter fraud, specifically focused on big cities.
[00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:14.165]  And specifically focused on, as you would imagine, big cities controlled by Democrats.
[00:08:15.106 --> 00:08:20.326]   And particularly focused on big cities I'd have a long history of corruption.
[00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:25.569]  The number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library.
[00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:44.001]  Just a few weeks ago, there was a conviction for voter fraud, and one two weeks before that, and I've often said, I guess sarcastically, but it's true, the only surprise I would have found in this is if Philadelphia hadn't cheated in this election.
[00:08:44.762 --> 00:08:49.713]   Because for the last 60 years, They've cheated in just about every single election.
[00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:52.354]  You could say the same thing about Detroit.
[00:08:53.535 --> 00:08:55.997]  Each one of these cities are cities that are controlled by Democrats.
[00:08:56.517 --> 00:08:58.358]  Which means they can get away with anything they want to do.
[00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:04.842]  It means they have a certain degree of control over... certainly control the election board completely.
[00:09:05.923 --> 00:09:07.304]  And they control law enforcement.
[00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:17.605]   And unfortunately, they have some friendly judges that will issue ridiculously irrational opinions Just to come out in their favor.
[00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:19.707]  So let's start with the specifics.
[00:09:21.048 --> 00:09:21.648]  Pennsylvania.
[00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:32.537]  In Pennsylvania, the margin of victory now for Biden, which is not a victory, it's a fraud, is 69,140 votes.
[00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:36.557]  69,140 votes.
[00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:46.756]   The reality is that we are now at a count of 682,770 ballots for which we have affidavits
[00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:52.677]   that there was no inspection of that ballot at the time that it was entered in the vote.
[00:09:52.704 --> 00:09:53.905]  It was a mail ballot.
[00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:57.807]  Mail ballots are particularly prone to fraud.
[00:09:58.488 --> 00:10:18.230]   We were warned about that by Jimmy Carter, President Jimmy Carter and Secretary Baker in a report about a dozen years ago in which they said that mail balloting is particularly susceptible of fraud that we should very carefully consider ever doing it And that it can be taken advantage of.
[00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:24.032]  Justice Souter warned us of the same thing in a comment in an election law case.
[00:10:24.912 --> 00:10:33.356]  And even the New York Times wrote articles about how dangerous mail-in voting was.
[00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:37.117]  And this is the first time we ever did it en masse.
[00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:41.179]  And I think we proved that all three are profits.
[00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:59.684]   It's not only susceptible to fraud, It is easily susceptible to fraud, particularly if you have a plan or scheme which sounds eerily similar to what Joe Biden told us a few days before the election, that he had the best voter fraud team in the world.
[00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:02.185]  Well, they were good.
[00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:08.849]  I don't know that they were that good because they made significant mistakes, like all crooks do, and we caught them.
[00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.352]  One of them was pushing out Republican inspectors.
[00:11:14.469 --> 00:11:29.057]  Every state, almost every civilized country, even Tanzania and places you wouldn't think of, have rules about inspectors, particularly for mail-in ballots.
[00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:31.038]  And why particularly for mail-in ballots?
[00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:34.780]  Because they can more easily be defrauded and you can't check them.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.661]  I don't want to give radio stations and TV stations a chance to either break away or...
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.580]  And the precinct in which you're voting.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.441]  You fill out your name and your address and you sign it.
[00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:45.361]  You then use an inner envelope and you put the ballot inside the inner envelope.
[00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:47.062]  You seal it all and you send it in.
[00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:49.320]  network is going commercial free right now.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.521]  Back to Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:54.241]  And the precinct in which you're voting.
[00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:57.401]  You fill out your name and your address and you sign it.
[00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:03.221]   You then use an inner envelope and you put the ballot inside the inner envelope.
[00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:06.680]  You seal it all and you send it in.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:14.901]   When it's being counted, almost invariably in the United States up until the mass cheating
[00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:20.440]   that went on in this election, a Republican and a Democrat inspector, as well as others
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.400]   if there are other parties, is allowed to watch the unsealing of this ballot.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.624]  It used to go on all over America when we conducted honest elections.
[00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:46.774]   Because the only time you can ever find out if it's a fraudulent ballot is when it is looked at, The minute you approve this, it's thrown away, gone for eternity, the only thing left is to vote.
[00:12:48.355 --> 00:13:05.788]  That could have been Mickey Mouse, that could have been a dead person, that could have been not filled out properly, that could have been the same person 30 times, that could have been, and all these things have happened by the way, that could have been nothing filled out.
[00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:07.289]  We'd never know.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:19.846]  So, for example, the recount being done in Georgia will tell us nothing, because these fraudulent ballots will just be counted again, because they wouldn't supply the signatures to match the ballots.
[00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:26.325]   So it means nothing to have counted these ballots because, for example, in Pennsylvania,
[00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:33.206]   where we have probably our most precise evidence, 682,770 of these ballots were
[00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:41.685]   cast, put in, and they weren't inspected, which renders them ballots that are null and void,
[00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:47.286]  cannot be counted, have to be removed from the vote.
[00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:47.799]  Why?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:57.203]  For several reasons, not the least of which is, that was basically only one of two places in the state where it was done.
[00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:02.926]  So in the other parts of the state, there was a legitimate inspection of the ballots.
[00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:12.206]   So if you have two different standards in different parts of the state, One favoring one part of the state, the other disfavoring the other part of the state.
[00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:16.288]  That's a classic violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
[00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:22.910]  Bush v. Gore being the most recent case that teaches that.
[00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.431]  That's not the only fraud that went on in Pennsylvania.
[00:14:29.172 --> 00:14:36.714]  All of the other frauds carried out in the other states by the Democrat bosses happened there as well.
[00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:51.235]  For example, if you made a mistake in that ballot and you lived in Philadelphia or in Pittsburgh, you were allowed to fix the mistake.
[00:14:52.456 --> 00:15:01.240]  But if you lived in the, what would be considered more Republican or Trump parts of the state, you were given no such right.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.322]  One of our plaintiffs, Mr. Henry, cast a absentee ballot.
[00:15:07.435 --> 00:15:14.476]  And he failed to put it in the secure envelope inside.
[00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:17.397]  He just put it in open, naked.
[00:15:18.677 --> 00:15:22.758]  That ballot was cast aside because it was invalid.
[00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:28.279]  Because that breaks the privacy of the vote.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:39.437]   In Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia, if they noticed that there wasn't an inner envelope, They'd contact the voter and allow him to vote again.
[00:15:40.118 --> 00:15:41.478]  Or if he didn't fill it out completely.
[00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:44.600]  Or if he made a mistake and didn't sign his full name.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.381]  He was allowed to cure it.
[00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:49.742]  There is no such provision under the law of Pennsylvania.
[00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:53.064]  The Democrat Secretary of State made that up.
[00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:57.126]  In order to maximize the votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
[00:15:57.947 --> 00:16:00.128]  And to minimize the votes in the other parts of the state.
[00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:01.248]  Clearly illegal.
[00:16:01.909 --> 00:16:02.829]  Clearly voter fraud.
[00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.390]  Easily provable.
[00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:05.991]  Hundreds of witnesses.
[00:16:06.914 --> 00:16:07.614]  Maybe thousands.
[00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:15.816]  We have, to give you another example, we have 17,000 provisional ballots cast in Pittsburgh.
[00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:18.856]  Do you know what a provisional ballot is?
[00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:21.697]  A provisional ballot usually happens this way.
[00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:24.278]  And about 15 of the 17,000 happen this way.
[00:16:24.898 --> 00:16:28.138]  You walk in and you say, I'm here to vote today.
[00:16:28.158 --> 00:16:32.719]  Oh, Mr. Giuliani, you already voted.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:34.620]  I did?
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.220]  I don't remember voting.
[00:16:37.691 --> 00:16:39.352]  Oh yes, yes, you cast an absentee ballot.
[00:16:40.693 --> 00:16:41.053]  No, I didn't.
[00:16:41.514 --> 00:16:41.914]  Yes, you did.
[00:16:42.154 --> 00:16:42.474]  No, I didn't.
[00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:43.075]  Yes, you did.
[00:16:44.356 --> 00:16:48.639]  So why does that happen 17,000 times in Pittsburgh?
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.443]  People walked in thinking they actually 15,000 to be precise.
[00:16:55.123 --> 00:17:07.413]   Why did it happen 15,000 times that people in Pittsburgh walked in to vote and they had already voted according to the Democrat Election machine.
[00:17:10.054 --> 00:17:10.654]  Did they forget?
[00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:17.276]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this happened to Republican voters in our office when they would try to vote.
[00:17:17.456 --> 00:17:18.456]  Oh, sorry, you can't.
[00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:21.117]  A lot of times they didn't tell you it's because somebody voted in their name.
[00:17:21.577 --> 00:17:24.517]  That happened to people I personally know in Austin as well that had moved from California.
[00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:26.198]  They went and looked at the Secretary of State.
[00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:27.378]  They voted for Hillary.
[00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:29.919]  They voted for Biden, even though they never voted for him.
[00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:30.999]  And they live in Texas.
[00:17:31.499 --> 00:17:33.780]  I mean, this is just massive.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.421]  My brother-in-law was in Austin at the major post office on Congress.
[00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:45.783]  He came on the show about it and saw a guy with 50 ballots there at the election with his name, with him accepting each one from him, him taking a picture of himself to get paid.
[00:17:46.144 --> 00:17:47.844]  I mean, this was industrial fraud.
[00:17:48.564 --> 00:17:50.205]  I'm sure this press conference is going to go for hours.
[00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:51.845]  He's still on one state right now.
[00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:52.726]  Let's continue.
[00:17:54.066 --> 00:18:01.897]   The 50 to 60 witnesses we have for the way they were treated and not allowed to inspect The ballots.
[00:18:02.418 --> 00:18:04.620]  They weren't just not allowed to do it.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.201]  They were pushed.
[00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:08.803]  A few cases, they were assaulted.
[00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:11.485]  In all cases, they were put in a corral.
[00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:18.670]  So far away, probably the closest they got is from here to the back of that room.
[00:18:19.751 --> 00:18:23.033]  We could do like a... Did you all watch My Cousin Vinny?
[00:18:24.214 --> 00:18:24.734]  You know the movie?
[00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:28.117]  It's one of my favorite law movies because he comes from Brooklyn.
[00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:35.471]  And when the nice lady who said she saw, and then he says to her, how many fingers do I have?
[00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:36.772]  How many fingers do I got up?
[00:18:38.013 --> 00:18:40.095]  And she says, three.
[00:18:41.356 --> 00:18:44.198]  Well, she was too far away to see it was only two.
[00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:49.041]  These people were further away than my cousin Vinnie was from witness.
[00:18:49.682 --> 00:18:50.603]  They couldn't see a thing.
[00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:52.084]  Now, I don't know.
[00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:54.766]  You're going to tell me that 60 people are lying?
[00:18:56.107 --> 00:18:57.308]  They didn't just tell me this.
[00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:02.222]  They swore under penalty of perjury, which is something no Democrats have ever done.
[00:19:03.763 --> 00:19:05.463]  You don't even ask Biden about this.
[00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.364]  You don't put him under penalty of perjury.
[00:19:09.384 --> 00:19:12.205]  He doesn't even get asked questions about it.
[00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:18.347]  He doesn't get asked questions about all the evidence of the crimes that he committed.
[00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:21.007]  These people are under penalty of perjury.
[00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.668]  Their names are on an affidavit.
[00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:29.606]   They swear that they weren't allowed To carry out their function as inspectors.
[00:19:30.146 --> 00:19:31.707]  And it's not just a technical thing.
[00:19:32.007 --> 00:19:33.268]  There's a reason they did it.
[00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:36.149]  And again, folks, it's not just that they swear it.
[00:19:36.189 --> 00:19:46.114]  We have video in Michigan, video in Wisconsin, video in Georgia, video in Pennsylvania of them boarding up the windows and assaulting people and throwing them out in violation of law.
[00:19:46.354 --> 00:19:46.834]  Continue.
[00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:51.696]  You were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[00:19:52.957 --> 00:19:54.718]  And you had a big road ahead of you.
[00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:59.989]  You had to catch him up for 700,000 to 800,000 votes that he was behind.
[00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:04.571]  And the only way you were going to do it was with the mail-in ballots.
[00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:08.873]  You couldn't have a Democrat and Republican inspector around.
[00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:10.794]  They don't even have Democrats watching.
[00:20:11.674 --> 00:20:14.975]  Because they'd be afraid that they'd be honest Democrats who would say, you're cheating!
[00:20:18.757 --> 00:20:23.119]  So that takes us to Michigan, where there was an honest Democrat who said they were cheating.
[00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:29.287]  And we'll show you her affidavit.
[00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:33.849]  Because I know you keep reporting, falsely, that we have no evidence.
[00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:36.670]  That we have no specific acts of fraud.
[00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.352]  That's because the coverage of this has been almost as dishonest as the scheme itself.
[00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:44.293]  The American people are entitled to know this.
[00:20:45.313 --> 00:20:46.774]  You don't have a right to keep it from them.
[00:20:47.754 --> 00:20:49.055]  You don't have a right to lie about it.
[00:20:49.975 --> 00:20:50.375]  And you are.
[00:20:51.636 --> 00:21:01.703]   I mean, you don't report to them that a citizen of this country A very fine woman who is willing to allow me to give you her name.
[00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:07.647]  I can't give you all these affidavits because if I do, these people will be harassed.
[00:21:08.548 --> 00:21:09.209]  They'll be threatened.
[00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:11.350]  They may lose their job.
[00:21:13.012 --> 00:21:14.032]  They will lose their friends.
[00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:17.315]  We've lost lawyers in this case because they've been threatened.
[00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.557]  We've had lawyers that need protection.
[00:21:21.258 --> 00:21:23.340]  What's going on in this country is horrible.
[00:21:24.548 --> 00:21:27.110]  And the censorship that you're imposing is making it worse.
[00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:33.474]  But, Jessie Jacob is an adult citizen and a resident of the state of Michigan.
[00:21:34.535 --> 00:21:37.557]  She's been an employee of the city of Detroit for decades.
[00:21:38.838 --> 00:21:43.962]  I know her age, but she can tell you her age.
[00:21:45.302 --> 00:21:57.867]   She was assigned to voting duties in September, and she was trained by the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan. She's basically trained to cheat.
[00:21:57.867 --> 00:22:05.597]   She said that I was instructed by my supervisor to adjust the mailing date of these absentee ballot
[00:22:05.597 --> 00:22:10.667]   packages to be dated earlier than when they were actually sent in.
[00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:19.656]   The supervisor made that announcement for all workers to engage in that fraudulent practice. That's not me saying
[00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:25.397]   that. That's just American citizens saying that. Same thing in Georgia. I don't
[00:22:25.397 --> 00:22:26.307]  know.
[00:22:25.642 --> 00:22:27.023]  Maybe you could say she's lying.
[00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.363]  But you can't say there's no evidence.
[00:22:29.703 --> 00:22:31.103]  This is what we call evidence.
[00:22:32.044 --> 00:22:33.204]  This is direct evidence.
[00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:34.864]  That's circumstantial.
[00:22:35.884 --> 00:22:38.585]  I tried many, many cases, as did all my colleagues here.
[00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:43.106]  You put a witness on a witness stand, the witness is testifying to their own knowledge.
[00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:49.007]  This witness goes on the witness stand and she will say, I was told to adjust the date on the absentee ballots.
[00:22:52.009 --> 00:23:03.131]  I witnessed election workers and employees going over to the voting booths with voters in order to watch them vote and coach them for whom to vote.
[00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:05.172]  Completely illegal.
[00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:07.492]  She will testify to that.
[00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:08.853]  I don't know.
[00:23:09.353 --> 00:23:10.693]  Biden's people can cross-examine her.
[00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.093]  But you can't just throw it away.
[00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:15.034]  Gee, there's no evidence.
[00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.174]  Next time you say that, you'll be lying.
[00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.335]  Caught this on video in Michigan.
[00:23:20.777 --> 00:23:30.181]  In Detroit, them teaching a class on how to not let people watch and how to take ballots that came in late and say that they came in on time.
[00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:31.502]  It's all on damn video.
[00:23:32.062 --> 00:23:36.204]  And then the Democrats that run the state call it threatening the journalists that cover it with jail time.
[00:23:36.504 --> 00:23:37.565]  These are criminals, folks.
[00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:38.485]  We've caught them red-handed.
[00:23:38.705 --> 00:23:39.986]  I'm just backing up Giuliani here.
[00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:41.467]  We have the frickin' video of this.
[00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:41.907]  Continue.
[00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:48.910]  When a person was trying to vote, don't ask for identification.
[00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:51.332]  Why would you not ask for identification?
[00:23:52.052 --> 00:23:57.094]  Because you knew that a lot of people not entitled to vote were going to come in and early vote.
[00:23:58.274 --> 00:24:01.835]  Because you knew that illegal immigrants were going to be allowed to vote.
[00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:06.457]  You knew, if you lived in Philadelphia, unless you're stupid.
[00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:07.997]  That's an Italian expression for stupid.
[00:24:08.898 --> 00:24:12.399]  Unless you're stupid, you knew that a lot of people were coming over from Camden to vote.
[00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:13.839]  They do every year.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.240]  Happens all the time in Philly.
[00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:20.860]  It's about as frequent as getting beaten up at a Philadelphia Eagles football game.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.241]  Happens all the time.
[00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:23.241]  All the time.
[00:24:24.442 --> 00:24:28.624]  And it's allowed to happen because it is a Democrat, corrupt city.
[00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.006]  And has been for years.
[00:24:33.447 --> 00:24:34.147]  Many, many years.
[00:24:34.607 --> 00:24:37.349]  And they carried it out in places they could get away with it.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.541]  They didn't carry it out in neutral places.
[00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:42.783]  They didn't carry it out in Republican places.
[00:24:43.363 --> 00:24:45.465]  They didn't carry it out where the law is respected.
[00:24:45.925 --> 00:24:53.531]  They carried it out in corrupt, in a corrupt city where the district attorney releases criminals on mass, which is why it has so much crime.
[00:24:55.613 --> 00:25:05.520]  She also said, I observed a large number of people who came to the satellite location to vote in person, but they had already applied for and submitted an absentee ballot.
[00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:09.160]  So she observed a lot of people voting twice.
[00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:17.926]  Again, this is Jesse Jacob, not me.
[00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:27.614]  I was instructed not to invalidate any ballots and not to look for any deficiency in the ballots.
[00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:31.196]  Why would you do that?
[00:25:31.216 --> 00:25:32.637]  Because you're cheating.
[00:25:33.778 --> 00:25:34.559]  On purpose, cheating.
[00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:36.260]  Intentionally cheating.
[00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:39.572]  You're cheating as a institution.
[00:25:40.092 --> 00:25:46.313]  This is an instruction from the Election Commissioner, or the employer, to the worker.
[00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.934]  Don't look for any deficiencies in the ballots.
[00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:55.656]  I was instructed not to look at any of the signatures on the absentee ballots.
[00:25:57.216 --> 00:26:04.778]  If she was instructed not to look for any of the signatures on the absentee ballots, why the heck did you sign it in the first place?
[00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:07.079]  In order to identify it.
[00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.074]  She was instructed not to do that because many of the absentee ballots were fraudulent.
[00:26:12.394 --> 00:26:12.955]  And they knew that.
[00:26:13.915 --> 00:26:15.036]  And they didn't want to have a count to that.
[00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:30.470]  On November 4, 2020, I was instructed to impromptly predate the absentee ballots when the receipt date was actually November... was after November 3, 2020.
[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:52.200]   Now this is really significant because Justice DeLito The Supreme Court instructed Pennsylvania that any ballot that comes in after 8 o'clock on November 3rd, 2020 had to be put aside and not opened because there's a question as to its legality and its constitutionality.
[00:26:53.201 --> 00:26:56.943]  What she's telling you is that they blatantly disregarded that order.
[00:26:58.164 --> 00:27:03.968]  That they took ballots that were marked the 4th and the 5th and the 6th and they marked it down for the 3rd.
[00:27:05.094 --> 00:27:07.956]  In blatant disregard of the order of the United States Supreme Court.
[00:27:09.076 --> 00:27:12.138]  I don't know if she's a Democrat or a Republican.
[00:27:13.318 --> 00:27:21.063]  I assume if she's working for the city of Detroit that she's a Democrat.
[00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:22.904]  I assume, but I may be wrong.
[00:27:23.304 --> 00:27:23.904]  She's a citizen.
[00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:26.305]  I've never met her.
[00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:27.486]  Never coached her.
[00:27:30.267 --> 00:27:36.331]   And I'd like you to note That it's signed under penalties of perjury.
[00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:40.355]  We have a hundred more of these.
[00:27:41.736 --> 00:27:45.899]  I can't show them to you because those people don't want to be harassed.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.284]  They don't want to have their lives torn apart by the goons on the other side.
[00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:53.866]  We don't do that to them.
[00:27:55.127 --> 00:27:57.289]  They've done that to a lot of our people.
[00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.790]  They've done it for four years.
[00:28:00.248 --> 00:28:02.349]  And it's outrageous that it's tolerated.
[00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.712]  And it's tolerated because you condone it in the press.
[00:28:07.113 --> 00:28:07.773]  And you don't cover it.
[00:28:07.793 --> 00:28:08.854]  And you don't condemn it.
[00:28:09.494 --> 00:28:11.656]  And it shouldn't happen to a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:16.959]  A lawyer shouldn't have to withdraw from a case because he's representing the President of the United States.
[00:28:20.942 --> 00:28:22.403]  There are many more affidavits here.
[00:28:23.123 --> 00:28:24.945]  I'd like to read them all to you, but I don't have the time.
[00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:27.746]  You should have had the time and energy to go look for them.
[00:28:29.247 --> 00:28:29.928]  That's your job.
[00:28:31.266 --> 00:28:34.547]  Like it's my job to defend the President and to represent the President.
[00:28:34.787 --> 00:28:38.689]  It's your job to read these things and not falsely report that there's no evidence.
[00:28:39.189 --> 00:28:42.190]  Do you know how many affidavits we have in the Michigan case?
[00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.250]  220 affidavits.
[00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:46.631]  They're not all public, but eight of them are.
[00:28:48.012 --> 00:28:57.695]  Four affiants here, those are people who give affidavits, report an incident that, under any other circumstances, would have been on the front page of all your newspapers.
[00:28:58.473 --> 00:29:04.536]  If it didn't involve the hatred that you have, irrational, pathological hatred that you have, for the President.
[00:29:06.237 --> 00:29:14.881]  What they swear to, is that at 4.30 in the morning, a truck pulled up to the Detroit Center, where they were counting ballots.
[00:29:16.182 --> 00:29:18.643]  The people thought it was food, so they all ran to the truck.
[00:29:18.663 --> 00:29:20.224]  It wasn't food.
[00:29:21.785 --> 00:29:24.226]  It was thousands and thousands of ballots.
[00:29:24.926 --> 00:29:29.639]   And the ballots were in garbage cans, they were in Paper bags.
[00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:31.860]  They were in cardboard boxes.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.740]  And they were taken into the center.
[00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:36.161]  They were put on a number of tables.
[00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.462]  At that time, they thought all the Republican inspectors had left.
[00:29:41.582 --> 00:29:42.482]  All but two had.
[00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:50.594]   And an employee of Dominion, who We will address a little bit later.
[00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:51.235]  Dominion.
[00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:58.758]  Now, remember, folks, this is live coverage of the Giuliani Path to Victory Trump 2020 powerful press conference.
[00:29:58.778 --> 00:30:02.639]  We're commercial free, but some stations need to carry their ads because they're automated stations.
[00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:03.820]  So we're firing the brakes.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.581]  And so some stations are not getting all this.
[00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:08.422]  Last three minutes was incredibly powerful.
[00:30:09.282 --> 00:30:11.143]  Giuliani just annihilating them with proof.
[00:30:11.463 --> 00:30:13.644]  We're going to continue on live coverage as long as this goes.
[00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:15.725]  I'm in Georgia at Stop the Steal.
[00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:17.185]  Owen Schroer is back in the ATX.
[00:30:17.505 --> 00:30:18.066]  Let's continue.
[00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:24.182]  And they're estimated to be a minimum of 60,000, maximum of 100,000.
[00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:32.109]  Many of them were triple counted, which means they were put into the counting machine this way.
[00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:36.432]  Once, twice, three times.
[00:30:38.534 --> 00:30:39.174]  I didn't see that.
[00:30:40.495 --> 00:30:44.458]  I don't know that, but for the fact that three American citizens are willing to swear to it.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.762]  And we're not going to let them go to court and do that?
[00:30:49.850 --> 00:31:01.796]  We're going to let this election go by when there are, in this case, 60 witnesses that can prove what I'm saying to you and other acts of fraud in Michigan?
[00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:06.978]  I mean, what's happened to this country if we're going to let that happen?
[00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:09.660]  What happened to this country if we're going to cover that up?
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:18.124]  We let Al Gore carry on an election dispute longer than this one has been going on for one state and for Chad's.
[00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:21.761]  This happened in Pennsylvania.
[00:31:22.341 --> 00:31:23.982]  It happened in Michigan.
[00:31:24.763 --> 00:31:41.214]  Michigan, probably, right now, if I count up the affidavits, just one case alone, Trump v. Benson, a case that we dismissed today because that case was attempting to get the Wayne County Board of Supervisors to decertify.
[00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:41.995]  Well, they did.
[00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:43.576]  They decertified.
[00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:45.897]  That case has 100 affidavits.
[00:31:48.095 --> 00:31:54.148]  And the 100 affidavits show essentially what I've talked to you about.
[00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:59.130]  Counting ballots improperly, counting them three and four times.
[00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.433]  It's like an old lady with no criminal record that sees the neighbor kill his wife in the backyard.
[00:32:03.453 --> 00:32:06.414]  The guy goes to the gas chamber or he goes to lethal injection.
[00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:12.859]  Imagine per county, they have like hundreds of witnesses of like total, complete fraud.
[00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.400]  I mean, I've had family witnesses in Austin.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.641]  This is incredible.
[00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:18.923]  Trump won by a gigantic landslide.
[00:32:19.163 --> 00:32:19.603]  Continue.
[00:32:19.623 --> 00:32:23.245]  It's basically in Detroit that Biden won 80-20.
[00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.573]  So you see a change as a result of the election in Michigan, if you take out Wayne County.
[00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:32.135]  So it's a very significant case.
[00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:37.038]  That is being raised in the case of Constantino versus the city of Detroit.
[00:32:37.898 --> 00:32:39.880]  Not by us, but by an individual plaintiff.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.142]  We are helping and assisting in that case, however.
[00:32:44.122 --> 00:32:48.025]  And you can find all the affidavits that you want filed in that case.
[00:32:48.894 --> 00:32:58.082]  And you can find out they're not just allegations, they're allegations supported by sworn testimony, which is a lot better than Joe Biden has ever done on anything.
[00:32:58.482 --> 00:33:01.765]  He doesn't answer questions, much less give you sworn affidavits.
[00:33:02.745 --> 00:33:03.346]  Wisconsin.
[00:33:04.587 --> 00:33:09.291]  Wisconsin had a very small margin.
[00:33:09.311 --> 00:33:10.152]  21, 2544 last time I looked.
[00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:15.376]  In Wisconsin, without going into great detail, very similar plan.
[00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:17.818]  Republicans shut out.
[00:33:18.712 --> 00:33:29.622]  In the city of Milwaukee and also in Madison, Republicans almost uniformly shut out from the absentee process, not allowed to inspect, not allowed to look at the ballots.
[00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:36.989]  We have in Milwaukee and in the state of Wisconsin, a much stricter law.
[00:33:37.689 --> 00:33:40.612]  Wisconsin doesn't allow mail-in ballots.
[00:33:40.872 --> 00:33:43.574]  They didn't buy into the big mail-in ballot situation.
[00:33:44.575 --> 00:33:50.214]   Wisconsin When you look at their Constitution, it almost seems to not like absentee ballots.
[00:33:50.874 --> 00:33:52.816]  They state it's not a right, a privilege.
[00:33:53.556 --> 00:33:56.198]  And they have very, very strict procedures.
[00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:01.802]  And the strict procedure says that you can't be given an absentee ballot.
[00:34:02.202 --> 00:34:03.763]  You have to personally apply for it.
[00:34:04.104 --> 00:34:07.166]  It's illegal, basically, to solicit a vote.
[00:34:08.607 --> 00:34:24.131]   And they have actually many reasons for it that probably goes back to their Progressive days, when I say progressive, I mean late 19th century, early 20th century progressive, when that really meant progressive, not retrogressive.
[00:34:25.552 --> 00:34:44.876]   So, there are 60,000 ballots in Milwaukee County, and 40,000 ballots in Madison, that, as far as we can tell, and this is why we're auditing, because we have very good information, the numbers are going to come out about here, That don't have applications.
[00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:55.843]  Under the law of the state of Wisconsin, already decided, if there's no application for an absentee ballot, the absentee ballot is thrown away.
[00:34:57.864 --> 00:35:01.146]  This all happened in two places in Wisconsin.
[00:35:01.546 --> 00:35:03.508]  Didn't happen in northern Wisconsin.
[00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:06.289]  Didn't happen in Republican Wisconsin.
[00:35:06.549 --> 00:35:10.812]  Didn't happen in neutral Wisconsin, where there are an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.
[00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:16.970]   It happened in A place where the vote was 75-80% for the Democrat.
[00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:24.014]  You take away any number of those, and that 20,000 lead disappears.
[00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:29.717]  In other words, if you count the lawful votes, Trump won Wisconsin by a good margin.
[00:35:30.118 --> 00:35:34.660]  Indeed, if you count the lawful votes in Pennsylvania, he won it by about 300,000 votes.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.599]  300,000 votes.
[00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:47.360]   Also in the lawsuit filed in Wisconsin, which is really a petition because of their procedures
[00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:51.312]  There were no inspectors provided for the count of the illegal ballots.
[00:35:52.273 --> 00:35:58.659]  Okay, you've got live, basically commercial-free coverage here of the Pats of Victory Rudolf Giuliani press conference.
[00:35:58.679 --> 00:35:59.540]  This is going to go for hours.
[00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:01.922]  I made a lot of preparation, I'm not complaining.
[00:36:02.499 --> 00:36:05.898]  of how to stop the great reset and just how draconian it is.
[00:36:05.898 --> 00:36:11.399]   And I wouldn't pull Klaus Schwab admitting to lockdown has nothing to do with COVID-19,
[00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:14.899]   but it's about quote, ending inequity, which means bankrupting everybody,
[00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:17.999]  making us poor and putting us under IMF World Bank control.
[00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:23.599]   I'm going to come back with Nick Fuentes, Jay Dyer and Ali Alexander in the fourth hour and cover this.
[00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:29.198]   But I'm going to come back even earlier by myself with Owen and at least do 30 minutes on this,
[00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:30.999]  because this is all unfolding now.
[00:36:31.071 --> 00:36:33.052]  This is just as serious as the election theft.
[00:36:33.433 --> 00:36:35.514]  It's all the same globalist takeover of America.
[00:36:35.915 --> 00:36:37.176]  Trump was blocking all of this.
[00:36:37.776 --> 00:36:39.138]  But we got some good news as well.
[00:36:39.158 --> 00:36:40.619]  But I got to just say this or we won't be here.
[00:36:41.772 --> 00:36:43.532]  I'm not funded by the New World Order.
[00:36:43.552 --> 00:36:46.313]  I'm not funded by any of these big globalist organizations.
[00:36:46.433 --> 00:36:50.094]  I'm funded by you, and I'm just asking you for your help.
[00:36:50.494 --> 00:36:52.554]  We have a big sale that I was going to end Wednesday.
[00:36:52.614 --> 00:36:55.635]  It's got to be extended through the weekend because I'm just, I don't have a new sale to do.
[00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:57.275]  So much stuff is about to be sold out.

[00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:06.522]  Your word of mouth is paramount.
[00:38:06.522 --> 00:38:07.722]  Here's the good news.
[00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:08.922]  America's putting up a big fight.
[00:38:08.922 --> 00:38:10.322]  We're not letting Trump quit.
[00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:13.221]   We're not quitting regardless, even if he quits, which we don't think is going to happen
[00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:14.922]  because the evidence is coming out.
[00:38:14.922 --> 00:38:16.422]  But most of Trump's campaigns quit.
[00:38:16.422 --> 00:38:18.222]  Most of the White House has quit and is selling him out.
[00:38:18.222 --> 00:38:19.321]  Giuliani isn't.
[00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:20.622]  Say what you want about Giuliani.
[00:38:20.622 --> 00:38:21.522]  He's not a coward.
[00:38:21.522 --> 00:38:22.522]  Neither is Pompeo.
[00:38:22.522 --> 00:38:24.321]  So we salute both of them.
[00:38:24.321 --> 00:38:27.022]   And I salute you all because this is a far and globalist takeover,
[00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:28.321]  but we need money to fight a war.
[00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:30.792]  These are great products, so it's a win-win.
[00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:37.154]  InfoWarsTore.com, take action now and fund this operation, the Second American Revolution, so we can stay on air.
[00:38:37.254 --> 00:38:38.774]  Your support is critical.
[00:38:39.094 --> 00:38:45.676]  Back to Rudolph Giuliani, and then Owen Schroeder will be taking over in between here into the next hour.
[00:38:46.776 --> 00:38:49.937]  Arizona is a state that we're looking at very, very carefully.
[00:38:50.948 --> 00:38:53.530]  I would say we're probably going to bring a lawsuit in Arizona.
[00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:54.692]  More than probably.
[00:38:54.872 --> 00:38:56.814]  I think we are going to bring a lawsuit in Arizona.
[00:38:56.854 --> 00:38:58.195]  We're still collecting that evidence.
[00:38:59.196 --> 00:39:10.046]  And the state that we're looking at that would surprise you is we have very, very significant amount of fraud allegations in the state of New Mexico.
[00:39:12.408 --> 00:39:16.655]   And we have a significant number of allegations in the state of Virginia.
[00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:22.217]  I don't know yet whether the number in Virginia will reach the number that can turn the election.
[00:39:22.917 --> 00:39:38.622]  In the states that we have indicated in red, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, we more than double the number of votes needed to overturn the election in terms of provable illegal ballots.
[00:39:39.503 --> 00:39:45.017]   All you gotta do to find out if I'm misleading you at all Is to look at the lawsuits.
[00:39:46.578 --> 00:39:47.338]  Look what's alleged.
[00:39:47.438 --> 00:39:48.359]  Look at the affidavits.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.261]  Maybe we can supply more affidavits.
[00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:53.302]  In order to do it, I have to get permission from the people.
[00:39:53.883 --> 00:39:58.266]  But in the materials I have here, there are at least 10 that come from citizens.
[00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:01.868]  We have a thousand at least.
[00:40:02.629 --> 00:40:03.970]  And we're getting more every day.
[00:40:04.951 --> 00:40:09.654]  And there are other aspects of this fraud that, at this point, I really can't reveal.
[00:40:11.122 --> 00:40:12.023]  This is really enough.
[00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.983]  It's enough to overturn any election.
[00:40:14.844 --> 00:40:19.286]  It's disgraceful what happened, and I'll conclude by asking you to just think about this for a minute.
[00:40:21.226 --> 00:40:29.250]  What happened on the morning of November 3rd when they were going to count this new kind of ballot, this mail-in ballot?
[00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:46.219]   Did every Democrat leader in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and in Georgia And in Nevada, and in Arizona, they all wake up and all separately have the same idea?
[00:40:47.379 --> 00:40:54.323]  Do they all separately have the idea that we are going to put Republicans systematically everywhere?
[00:40:55.564 --> 00:40:58.325]  We're not going to let them look at mail-in or absentee ballots?
[00:40:59.646 --> 00:41:00.967]  They all independently come up with that.
[00:41:02.128 --> 00:41:04.389]  Like, just by coincidence.
[00:41:05.249 --> 00:41:10.115]   They say, hey, you know, we're going to put We're going to put the Republicans in pens and corrals.
[00:41:10.675 --> 00:41:11.936]  We're going to do it in Pittsburgh.
[00:41:11.956 --> 00:41:13.096]  We're going to do it in Philadelphia.
[00:41:13.576 --> 00:41:14.877]  We're going to do it in Detroit.
[00:41:15.657 --> 00:41:16.878]  We're going to do it in Milwaukee.
[00:41:16.898 --> 00:41:18.658]  We're going to do it in Las Vegas.
[00:41:18.678 --> 00:41:21.039]  We're going to do it in Phoenix.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.180]  What did I miss?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.261]  Oh, we're going to do it in Atlanta.
[00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:35.545]  Or, isn't the logical conclusion that I think any jury would accept, if they heard this evidence, that somebody had this plan?
[00:41:36.812 --> 00:41:44.716]  Maybe that was always the plan, to do this very, very questionable form of voting, which has been criticized.
[00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:46.337]  Yes, it's an organized, concerted fraud.
[00:41:46.377 --> 00:41:47.237]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:41:47.518 --> 00:41:50.019]  It's why Pelosi said Trump will not win.
[00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.420]  We don't care about what's happening next week.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.760]  Biden won't be put in.
[00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:56.822]  It's why we have the inside and TV folks at Dominion saying it doesn't matter, he will win.
[00:41:57.143 --> 00:42:03.246]  It was organized like all the other organized fraud and the media not letting anybody question and blocking witnesses.
[00:42:03.846 --> 00:42:06.588]  Even including official poll watchers who came out.
[00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:07.929]  They were all censored by the internet.
[00:42:07.949 --> 00:42:09.050]  They were all censored by Big Tech.
[00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:15.315]  That's an organized criminal syndicate and mainstream media and Big Tech have been complicit in trying to overthrow our country.
[00:42:15.555 --> 00:42:17.436]  This is our country fighting for its damn life.
[00:42:17.657 --> 00:42:18.317]  This is war.
[00:42:18.597 --> 00:42:19.238]  Back to Giuliani.
[00:42:19.258 --> 00:42:21.620]  The reason why he probably didn't have to go out and campaign.
[00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:26.123]  He had to have known what they were going to do.
[00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:27.924]  This had to be planned in advance.
[00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:36.075]   I'm kind of checking Did they go, you know, to the same contractor to get the corrals to put the Republicans in?
[00:42:37.496 --> 00:42:39.657]  And this is a disgraceful thing that was done in this country.
[00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:40.998]  Probably not much more disgraceful.
[00:42:43.305 --> 00:42:45.547]  You hear with Giuliani how he's finishing my sentences?
[00:42:45.587 --> 00:42:46.247]  We didn't talk.
[00:42:46.307 --> 00:42:46.868]  It's the truth.
[00:42:47.508 --> 00:42:49.470]  This is organized fraud.
[00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.271]  Biden didn't even need to campaign.
[00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:53.053]  He even said in a speech, I don't need your votes.
[00:42:53.093 --> 00:42:53.573]  I'm going to win.
[00:42:53.593 --> 00:42:54.134]  Remember that?
[00:42:54.214 --> 00:42:54.914]  I don't need your votes.
[00:42:55.475 --> 00:42:56.435]  Find that clip, Owen.
[00:42:56.456 --> 00:42:57.596]  Play that next hour a bunch.
[00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:58.857]  Back to Giuliani.
[00:42:58.877 --> 00:43:00.259]  We got to get this whole press conference up.
[00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:00.959]  This is powerful.
[00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:01.359]  Continue.
[00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:02.480]  We're going to become Venezuela.
[00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:04.842]  We cannot let this happen to us.
[00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:12.008]  We cannot not allow these crooks, because that's what they are, to steal an election from the American people.
[00:43:12.941 --> 00:43:14.001]  They elected Donald Trump.
[00:43:16.282 --> 00:43:18.062]  They didn't elect Joe Biden.
[00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:31.486]  Joe Biden is in the lead because of the fraudulent ballots, the illegal ballots that were produced and that were allowed to be used after the election was over.
[00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:32.426]  That's right.
[00:43:33.786 --> 00:43:36.567]  Give us an opportunity to prove it in court and we will.
[00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:48.488]   Now I'm going to ask Sidney Powell To describe to you what we can describe about another totally outrageous situation.
[00:43:49.208 --> 00:44:06.620]  I don't think most Americans know that our ballots get calculated, many of them outside the United States, and are completely open to hacking, completely open to change, and it's being done by a company that specializes in voter fraud.
[00:44:07.661 --> 00:44:08.882]  I'll let Sidney describe that to you.
[00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:12.510]  Thank you, Rudy.
[00:44:15.952 --> 00:44:33.744]  What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States.
[00:44:34.784 --> 00:44:59.815]   The Dominion voting systems, the Smartmatic technology software, And the software that goes in other computerized voting systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez to make sure he never lost an election after one constitutional referendum came out the way he did not want it to come out.
[00:45:02.674 --> 00:45:04.075]  And again, folks, this is all true.
[00:45:04.095 --> 00:45:08.660]  This is a communist Chinese globalist takeover with criminals in our government.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.501]  China Joe, this is the truth.
[00:45:10.802 --> 00:45:14.645]  It's a fact that it was tabulated in Venezuela and in Germany, and it's all coming out.
[00:45:14.705 --> 00:45:17.768]  We cannot give up because this is a foreign takeover.
[00:45:17.808 --> 00:45:18.128]  This is war.
[00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:21.031]  And they can't take us down with a frontal attack.
[00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.113]  They can only take us down from within, and this is it.
[00:45:23.413 --> 00:45:25.315]  And right now, we're getting taken down, folks.
[00:45:25.755 --> 00:45:32.962]  We're getting taken down, and they're saying the economy will never be turned on again, we'll be totally bankrupt forever, and have communism and own nothing.
[00:45:33.302 --> 00:45:36.926]  But the bankers will be offshore in jumbo jets with private islands.
[00:45:37.266 --> 00:45:39.328]  I mean, this is a James Bond movie for real.
[00:45:39.728 --> 00:45:41.250]  I'm going to hand this over to Owen Schroer.
[00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.333]  We'll do as much commercial freight as we can into the next hour.
[00:45:44.853 --> 00:45:54.697]  Then I'll be back later to break down how we fight back at the heart of this and start calling for the arrest of the DeVos globalists on top that are doing this so the public knows who's behind this.
[00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:57.158]  Because our real power is we can predict what's coming next.
[00:45:57.578 --> 00:46:02.180]  We'll go back to the rest of the press conference with Owen Schroer and I'll be back later here in the next few hours.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.722]  Please stay with us and send the links out to BandOffVideo and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:08.081]  That's the chain reaction.
[00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:09.561]  Say America's fighting back.
[00:46:09.561 --> 00:46:10.882]  We've discovered the fraud.
[00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:11.920]  Find out what's censored.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.661]  Find out what MSN doesn't want you to see.
[00:46:13.661 --> 00:46:17.281]   Find out how we save the country and ourselves and send that link out on your email,
[00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:19.241]  text message, word of mouth now.
[00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:21.362]  Send the live feed out back to the live feed.
[00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:26.681]   So overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm
[00:46:26.681 --> 00:46:28.842]  that had been plugged into the system.
[00:46:28.842 --> 00:46:33.842]   And that's what caused them to have to shut down in the states they shut down in.
[00:46:33.842 --> 00:46:39.201]   That's when they came in the back door with all the mail-in ballots,
[00:46:39.201 --> 00:46:41.760]  many of which they had actually fabricated.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:49.241]   Some were on pristine paper with identically matching perfect circle dots for Mr. Biden.
[00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:53.721]  Others were shoved in in batches.
[00:46:53.754 --> 00:46:58.298]  They're always put in a certain number of batches and people would rerun the same batch.
[00:46:58.938 --> 00:47:15.693]  This corresponds to our statistical evidence that shows incredible spikes in the vote counts at particular times and that corresponds to eyewitness testimony of numerous people who have come forward and said they saw the ballots come in the back door at that time.
[00:47:16.537 --> 00:47:21.781]  Notably, the Dominion executives are nowhere to be found now.
[00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:26.003]  They are moving their offices overnight to different places.
[00:47:26.083 --> 00:47:29.566]  Their office in Toronto was shared with one of the Soros entities.
[00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:44.012]  One of the leaders of the Dominion Project overall is Lord Malick Brown, Mr. Soros' number two person in the UK and part of his organization.
[00:47:44.352 --> 00:47:52.354]  There are ties of the Dominion leadership to the Clinton Foundation and to other known politicians in this country.
[00:47:53.194 --> 00:48:05.597]   Just to give you a brief description of how this worked, I'm going to quote from A letter that was written and I will read that to make sure I get the quotes right.
[00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:13.943]  This person was objecting to the United States acquisition of Sequoia Voting Systems by Smartmatic, a foreign owned company.
[00:48:14.644 --> 00:48:23.210]  I believe this transaction raises exactly the sort of foreign ownership issues that CFIUS is best positioned to examine for national security purposes.
[00:48:24.108 --> 00:48:28.049]  It's undisputed that Smartmatic is foreign-owned and it has acquired Sequoia.
[00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:30.270]  They keep changing the names as they go along.
[00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.272]  Different times when a problem comes up, they just create another corporation and call it a different name.
[00:48:36.532 --> 00:48:40.074]  But it was a voting machine company doing business in the United States.
[00:48:40.514 --> 00:48:46.036]  Sequoia voting machines were used to record over 125 million votes during the 2004 presidential election in the United States.
[00:48:50.899 --> 00:49:01.376]  Smartmatic now acknowledges that Antonio Mujica, a Venezuelan businessman, has controlling interest in Smartmatic, but the company has not revealed who all the Smartmatic owners are.
[00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:06.745]  According to the press, Smartmatic's owners are hidden through a web of offshore private entities.
[00:49:07.285 --> 00:49:09.166]  And that is, in fact, true.
[00:49:09.827 --> 00:49:23.273]  Smartmatic has been associated with the Venezuelan government led by Hugo Chavez, which is openly hostile to the United States, and of course, as we all know, communistic and really brutalizing its own people.
[00:49:23.753 --> 00:49:28.375]  The system has been continued there by Mr. Maduro and ensured his election.
[00:49:29.455 --> 00:49:44.068]  Smartmatic's possible connection to the Venezuelan government poses a potential national security concern in the context of its acquisition of Sequoia because electronic voting machines are susceptible to tampering and insiders are in the best position to engage in such tampering.
[00:49:44.989 --> 00:49:48.031]  This letter expresses concern of the Chicago 2006 primary election.
[00:49:50.811 --> 00:50:05.900]  And it ends by saying the products and services that are of Venezuelan origin and evaluate Smartmatic's ownership to determine who could have influence and control over these and other Sequoia products and services are important to the national security of the United States.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:14.765]  This letter was written to Hank Paulson on October 6, 2006 by Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney.
[00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:24.535]   Senators Klobuchar and Warren have raised these concerns as recently as December 2019.
[00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:36.563]  Why our government has not taken them seriously is beyond my comprehension unless they have some of the three-letter agencies have used them themselves in other parts of the world.
[00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:41.566]  We know that the technology was exported to affect an election in Argentina.
[00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:47.710]  That's admitted by our friend who wrote the affidavit about Hugo Chavez and his interest in Smartmatic.
[00:50:50.277 --> 00:50:57.743]  Again, in 2006, Carolyn Maloney wrote the Honorable John Snow, the Secretary of the Treasury, about the issues.
[00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:14.157]  Speaking of Smartmatic's leadership, one of the Smartmatic patent holders, Eric Coomer, I believe his name is, is on the web as being recorded in a conversation with Antifa.
[00:51:14.861 --> 00:51:20.425]  Members saying that he had the election rigged for Mr. Biden.
[00:51:20.845 --> 00:51:22.106]  Nothing to worry about here.
[00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:25.828]  And he was going to, they were going to F Trump.
[00:51:26.628 --> 00:51:37.175]  His social media is filled with hatred for the president and for the United States of America as a whole, as are the social media accounts of many other smartmatic people.
[00:51:39.076 --> 00:51:41.079]  There has been widespread use of this.
[00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:46.005]  Dominion itself is utilized in 2,000 jurisdictions in 30 states.
[00:51:46.706 --> 00:51:52.374]  It has been uncertifiable in multiple states who realized all the problems that it had, including Texas.
[00:51:53.195 --> 00:52:04.606]  Experts have described it across the board from a Princeton group of three professors to experts that we have talked to about its end-user vulnerabilities.
[00:52:05.306 --> 00:52:08.710]  People can admittedly go in and change whatever they want.
[00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:11.993]  They can set the ratio of votes from one thing to another.
[00:52:12.073 --> 00:52:17.678]  They can say that a Biden vote counts as 1.25 and a Trump vote counts as 0.75.
[00:52:19.344 --> 00:52:21.967]  And those may be the numbers that were actually used here.
[00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:25.290]  It's not just the swing states that were affected.
[00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:30.435]  The algorithm was likely run across the country to affect the entire election.
[00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:45.268]   Like I said, we only discovered it this year because of the overwhelming number of votes for President Trump in the swing states that caused the machines to have to shut down for them to backfill Uh, for adding votes.
[00:52:45.888 --> 00:52:58.336]  We have evidence of different numbers of votes being injected into the system, the same identical, unique six digit number multiple times in at least two states that we've analyzed so far.
[00:52:58.196 --> 00:53:06.196]   and I'm talking about like 341,542 votes for Biden and 100,012 for Trump.
[00:53:06.196 --> 00:53:14.196]   There's no explanation, no logical explanation for the same numbers being injected 20 minutes apart into the machine.
[00:53:14.196 --> 00:53:24.196]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:53:15.728 --> 00:53:27.178]  The software manual itself, you can download it from the internet and I would encourage you all to read it because it specifically advertises some of these things as features of the system.
[00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:36.225]  Why it was ever allowed into this country is beyond my comprehension and why nobody has dealt with it is absolutely appalling.
[00:53:36.897 --> 00:53:39.219]  The machines were easily accessible to hackers.
[00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:46.325]  There's a video on the net that will explain to you how a kid with a cell phone can hack one of these voting machines.
[00:53:47.626 --> 00:53:50.349]  There's been no oversight of Dominion or its software.
[00:53:50.369 --> 00:53:54.572]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to continue this uninterrupted coverage of this historic press conference.
[00:53:54.612 --> 00:53:57.035]  We have to take this top-of-the-hour break though.
[00:53:57.095 --> 00:54:00.738]  It's two minutes and we'll be right back live with Sidney Powell.
[00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:03.993]  Sidney Powell is live.
[00:54:04.033 --> 00:54:09.220]  Rudy Giuliani eviscerated the Democrat voter fraud for an hour.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.702]  I had to stand in applause.
[00:54:10.742 --> 00:54:14.106]  Sidney Powell is up to bat now and she's doing the same thing.
[00:54:14.627 --> 00:54:17.110]  Let's go back live to this historic press conference.
[00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:22.691]   in other countries. We know specifically that Venezuela exported it for that
[00:54:22.691 --> 00:54:27.210]   purpose to Argentina and other Latin American companies to make sure that the
[00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.889]   corrupt rulers who were willing to pay the highest price for being in office
[00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:41.851]   were allowed to rig their elections. This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating
[00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:51.130]   and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for people in this country to
[00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:53.851]  have participated in in any way shape or form.
[00:54:54.634 --> 00:54:59.235]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[00:54:59.815 --> 00:55:07.397]  American patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government.
[00:55:07.557 --> 00:55:09.717]  And we are going to take this country back.
[00:55:10.198 --> 00:55:11.978]  We are not going to be intimidated.
[00:55:12.078 --> 00:55:13.658]  We are not going to back down.
[00:55:14.138 --> 00:55:17.019]  We are going to clean this mess up now.
[00:55:17.519 --> 00:55:19.780]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.980]  We are going to prove it.
[00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:26.792]  And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.
[00:55:31.234 --> 00:55:34.316]  How come you're not suing in the Wisconsin counties that use this?
[00:55:34.416 --> 00:55:36.797]  Why are you only doing a recount?
[00:55:36.917 --> 00:55:39.258]  Excuse me, we're not out to the questions at this point.
[00:55:40.298 --> 00:55:42.459]  So excuse me, we're not at the questions at this point.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:46.681]  My name is Jenna Ellis and I'm the senior legal advisor to the Trump campaign.
[00:55:46.701 --> 00:55:49.723]  Alright, so a Democrat hack obviously in the audience trying to scuttle this.
[00:55:49.783 --> 00:55:50.423]  It's not going to work.
[00:55:51.226 --> 00:55:54.127]  Where we're at and what you can expect from this process.
[00:55:54.527 --> 00:56:00.030]  So what you have heard, I'm sure, in the fake newspapers tomorrow will be one of two things.
[00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:05.312]  Either there was not sufficient evidence that we've presented or we spoke too long.
[00:56:06.073 --> 00:56:10.035]  Okay, so what you've heard now is basically an opening statement.
[00:56:10.595 --> 00:56:22.300]  This is what you can expect to see when we get to court to actually have a full trial on the merits to actually show this evidence in court and prove our case.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.922]  This is not a Law & Order episode where everything is neatly wrapped up in 60 minutes.
[00:56:27.362 --> 00:56:35.226]  For those of you who are here in this room or have maybe tuned out in other networks, clearly you've never been court reporters.
[00:56:36.343 --> 00:56:37.464]  Trials take time.
[00:56:37.724 --> 00:56:39.184]  Putting on evidence takes time.
[00:56:39.344 --> 00:56:55.972]  This is basically an opening statement so the American people can understand what the networks have been hiding and what they refuse to cover because all of your fake news headlines are dancing around the merits of this case and are trying to delegitimize what we are doing here.
[00:56:56.332 --> 00:57:02.575]  Let me be very clear that our objective is to make sure to preserve and protect election integrity.
[00:57:02.915 --> 00:57:10.000]   President Trump has been saying from day one That this is about maintaining free and fair elections in this country.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.642]  It is not about overturning an outcome.
[00:57:12.802 --> 00:57:16.546]  It is about making sure that election integrity is preserved.
[00:57:16.586 --> 00:57:18.688]  And every American should want that.
[00:57:19.248 --> 00:57:23.432]  If every American is not on board with that, you have to ask yourself why.
[00:57:24.012 --> 00:57:31.159]  And if your fake news network is not covering this or allowing you to cover it fairly and accurately, you should ask yourself why.
[00:57:31.779 --> 00:57:34.521]  This is absolutely a legitimate legal basis.
[00:57:34.921 --> 00:57:42.866]  We have been asked to provide an entire case that generally would take years in civil litigation.
[00:57:43.266 --> 00:57:44.267]  I've been a prosecutor.
[00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:47.488]  I have tried cases with far simpler facts.
[00:57:48.129 --> 00:57:51.491]  One thing happened in a matter of minutes and it still takes days.
[00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:54.473]  And we go through a jury process.
[00:57:55.193 --> 00:57:57.394]  This is the court of public opinion right now.
[00:57:57.855 --> 00:58:00.016]  We are not trying our case in the court of public opinion.
[00:58:00.672 --> 00:58:02.973]  Because if we were, we would get unbiased jurors.
[00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:10.978]  I would strike 99% of you from the jury, and I would be allowed to, because of the fake news coverage you provide.
[00:58:11.078 --> 00:58:13.159]  You are not unbiased jurors.
[00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:28.508]  And until you step out of your role as a journalist and actually go into a courtroom, and you are a judge on a bench that has sworn an oath to be unbiased in our separation of powers, then your opinion does not matter.
[00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:29.989]  The facts matter.
[00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.929]  The truth matters.
[00:58:31.009 --> 00:58:38.354]  And if you are fair reporters, you will cover that fairly and appropriately and you will allow coverage of our media.
[00:58:38.374 --> 00:58:42.037]  This is Jenna Ellis, one of Trump's great legal team members.
[00:58:42.257 --> 00:58:44.238]  I mean, what an absolute champion.
[00:58:44.478 --> 00:58:45.599]  This is incredible, folks.
[00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:46.980]  We're skipping these breaks.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:47.841]  This is historic.
[00:58:48.481 --> 00:58:48.801]  Wow.
[00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:49.982]  What a moment here.
[00:58:50.162 --> 00:58:52.404]  American patriots are rising and fighting back.
[00:58:52.444 --> 00:58:53.404]  This is only the beginning.
[00:58:53.424 --> 00:58:54.305]  We've only begun to fight.
[00:58:54.345 --> 00:58:55.946]  Let's go back to this historic press conference.
[00:58:57.126 --> 00:59:02.526]   then that is absolutely unacceptable for journalistic standards.
[00:59:02.526 --> 00:59:05.106]  This is an opening statement.
[00:59:05.106 --> 00:59:09.166]   This is something where we have told you what the evidence will show, and we have given
[00:59:09.166 --> 00:59:10.166]  you a brief description.
[00:59:10.166 --> 00:59:13.165]  That happens in a courtroom all the time.
[00:59:13.165 --> 00:59:16.965]  That's not the fact-finding process.
[00:59:16.965 --> 00:59:18.626]  That is just an overview.
[00:59:18.626 --> 00:59:21.526]   That is what we have given you today because the American people deserve to know what we
[00:59:21.526 --> 00:59:24.286]  have uncovered in the last couple of weeks.
[00:59:24.286 --> 00:59:27.726]  Remember, this is such a short time frame.
[00:59:27.726 --> 00:59:32.766]   And this is an elite strike force team that is working on behalf of the President and
[00:59:32.766 --> 00:59:36.126]   the campaign to make sure that our Constitution is protected.
[00:59:36.131 --> 00:59:40.314]  We are a nation of rules, not a nation of rulers.
[00:59:41.315 --> 00:59:46.500]  There is not someone that just gets to pick who the next president is outside the will of the American people.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:53.466]  And that is our task, because when we talk about voter fraud, it's actually election official fraud.
[00:59:54.665 --> 00:59:55.625]  That cannot stand.
[00:59:55.685 --> 01:00:01.487]  The Constitution requires that the state legislatures are the ones that make election laws.
[01:00:01.547 --> 01:00:07.768]  Once again, this is InfoWars live coverage of the historic Stop the Steal press conference is what we'll call it.
[01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:11.069]  Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis speaking now.
[01:00:11.449 --> 01:00:13.409]  Joseph DeGeneva, it looks like, is in the background.
[01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:14.250]  Maybe he'll speak too.
[01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.390]  And Jenna Ellis is just laying it all out right now.
[01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.311]  No holds barred.
[01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:19.771]  Let's go back to this live coverage.
[01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:34.459]  Our founders were so brilliant that they anticipated this, that there would be corruption, there would be foreign influence, there would be attempts to manipulate the outcome of the election, especially with who they called our chief magistrate.
[01:00:34.739 --> 01:00:38.577]   I would encourage all of you to go home and actually read Alexander Hamilton's Federalist
[01:00:38.577 --> 01:00:48.938]   68 and see what he described as an advocacy position to adopt and ratify the Electoral
[01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:53.378]  College and the process by which we select our president.
[01:00:53.378 --> 01:00:58.179]   We select our president through the Electoral College, not because it disenfranchises voters,
[01:00:58.179 --> 01:01:03.019]   but because it is a security mechanism for exactly the type of corruption that we are
[01:01:03.019 --> 01:01:04.458]  uncovering.
[01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:08.538]   And every American should be grateful and thankful that our founders had the foresight
[01:01:08.538 --> 01:01:14.418]   to put in those protections and provisions to make sure that your legitimate legal vote
[01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:17.059]  is not disenfranchised.
[01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:18.619]  That is what we are advocating for.
[01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:21.868]  We want to make sure to protect election integrity.
[01:01:22.448 --> 01:01:35.158]  And your president, President Trump, we are so proud that he is in this fight because he understands that when he swore his oath of office, he swore an oath to uphold and defend the United States Constitution.
[01:01:35.518 --> 01:01:36.699]  That is what he is doing.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.021]  And that is what we are doing.
[01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:45.926]  We are confident that through this multiple pathway to victory, we will get to the actual outcome that the evidence shows.
[01:01:47.435 --> 01:01:50.396]  But this is not about overturning an election on our part.
[01:01:50.856 --> 01:01:57.237]  It's about making sure that we protect and preserve free and fair elections for all future American elections.
[01:01:57.577 --> 01:02:10.139]  If the United States caves to corruption, or this type of election integrity disaster, then no election will be secure from here on out.
[01:02:10.979 --> 01:02:14.120]  And we all need to be keenly aware of that.
[01:02:14.915 --> 01:02:24.741]  We are the representatives here that are standing in this gap and defending President Trump and defending you, the American people, at the end of the day.
[01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:28.122]  This is ultimately about the United States of America.
[01:02:28.683 --> 01:02:30.824]  And we want to make sure to protect and defend that.
[01:02:30.844 --> 01:02:33.485]  And as my colleagues have said, we will not back down.
[01:02:33.566 --> 01:02:34.566]  We won't be intimidated.
[01:02:34.826 --> 01:02:36.347]  President Trump will not be intimidated.
[01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:38.668]  You, the American people, should not be intimidated.
[01:02:38.748 --> 01:02:41.430]  You, the press, should cover this fairly.
[01:02:42.418 --> 01:02:47.499]  And should know that this matters to election integrity and it matters to the future of our nation.
[01:02:48.439 --> 01:02:52.160]  So we have given you an overview, but recognize this is not a court of law.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:03:04.783]  We will get there and we have time and we have constitutional provisions that will step in when we show the corruption and the irredeemably challenged and overturned votes.
[01:03:05.492 --> 01:03:09.411]  that are absolutely corrupt in all of these counties.
[01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.492]  It is irredeemably compromised.
[01:03:11.492 --> 01:03:14.411]  We will show that, but you have to give us that opportunity.
[01:03:14.411 --> 01:03:18.532]   This has been just our opening statement, and we have an opportunity to get there,
[01:03:18.532 --> 01:03:21.251]  and we have time, and we will do that.
[01:03:21.251 --> 01:03:25.292]   This is the United States of America, and we stand proudly for President Donald J. Trump.
[01:03:25.292 --> 01:03:26.132]  Thank you.
[01:03:26.132 --> 01:03:28.972]  That was incredible.
[01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.892]  Let's go back to Sidney Powell.
[01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.531]  Who is watching this?
[01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:37.571]   I have gotten multiple emails from people in other countries who watched
[01:03:37.571 --> 01:03:39.812]  the same pattern happen there.
[01:03:39.812 --> 01:03:44.931]   We have witness testimony that the same things were done in those countries,
[01:03:44.931 --> 01:03:52.372]   as this was exported from Venezuela by Maduro and by Mr. Chavez and by Cuba.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:04:02.091]  And of course we know China also has a substantial presence in Venezuela and substantial interest in making sure that President Trump does not continue in office.
[01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:11.022]   This is the consummate Foreign interference in our election in the most criminal way you can possibly imagine.
[01:04:11.622 --> 01:04:12.903]  It must be shut down.
[01:04:13.303 --> 01:04:30.653]  We know, for example, that one of the Dominion's highest level employees or officers went to Detroit himself to man the Detroit Operations Center where he could watch the votes coming in real time and decide what file folder in the system to put those votes into.
[01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:38.688]  That's why you see massive spikes after hours when people were told that all the votes were in and all the votes were counted.
[01:04:39.332 --> 01:04:42.993]  Many Dominion employees have already reached out to us to tell us the truth.
[01:04:43.394 --> 01:04:46.975]  They are Americans who want to ensure election integrity like we do.
[01:04:47.255 --> 01:04:52.295]   I would encourage every Dominion or Smartmatic employee who is fed up with the corruption
[01:04:52.295 --> 01:04:57.014]   in this country to come forward as soon as possible because these are serious federal
[01:04:57.014 --> 01:05:02.535]   offenses that I am confident the Department of Justice will be in pursuit of in very short
[01:05:02.535 --> 01:05:04.055]  order if they are not already.
[01:05:04.055 --> 01:05:11.055]  Thank you.
[01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:21.679]  Mayor Giuliani, this sort of reminds us of 30 years ago, they had federal judges doing consent decrees over elections, so you had a federal judge overseeing the election.
[01:05:21.739 --> 01:05:27.725]  Will you be asking that in Georgia, where you have two Senate races, the U.S.
[01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:31.508]  District Court judges and federal authorities monitoring elections?
[01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:34.771]  I can't say what's going to be done about it.
[01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:39.663]  I'm sorry, in what county?
[01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:43.223]  Yes.
[01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:45.424]  I know about it.
[01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.504]  I really can't give you an opinion on that.
[01:05:48.485 --> 01:05:56.006]  I think, obviously, every election official should learn something from this and be very, very careful with the next election.
[01:05:56.606 --> 01:06:18.204]   I know this is a lot of information that we've given you, probably because we're frustrated with What we keep reading and hearing in the censored press, which is that we have no evidence, we have no specifics, we have no backup for what we're saying, and you largely ignore the affidavits that are filed.
[01:06:19.365 --> 01:06:23.247]  Whether you agree or disagree with an affidavit, it's evidence.
[01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:29.692]  You can't say, I mean, you're just lying to the American people when you say there's no evidence.
[01:06:31.249 --> 01:06:37.693]  Sidney was giving you information that come from affidavits from other people that are given under oath.
[01:06:38.793 --> 01:07:15.055]   I was explaining things to you from affidavits that come from other people, American citizens, who swear under oath that they saw 100,000 ballots come in and that they were all for Joe Biden and that, I should point out now that Sidney has spoken, that those happened Just around the time that the Dominion or Smartmatic people called a halt to the election and then you can also trace it with a very big spike in the vote count at exactly that time.
[01:07:16.516 --> 01:07:16.796]  Right up.
[01:07:18.197 --> 01:07:32.298]   So what we're telling you is supported by evidence and we're going to have to present these because of the procedures that exist According to the different voting laws of the different states.
[01:07:32.338 --> 01:07:35.640]  For example, you asked us about Wisconsin.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:45.206]  We have to first create a contest in Wisconsin before we can move to bringing a fulsome federal lawsuit.
[01:07:46.067 --> 01:07:50.330]  The contest, from everything I can see, is going to overturn the vote.
[01:07:51.090 --> 01:08:01.342]   Because it's going to show somewhere around 100,000 illegal ballots in two counties That Biden carried by 75, 80 percent.
[01:08:01.382 --> 01:08:02.843]  And you know how close Wisconsin is.
[01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:08.585]  And what I'm talking about is the absentee ballots for which there were no applications.
[01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.006]  And that's not just a small matter.
[01:08:11.606 --> 01:08:21.950]  The reason for the application and the reason to keep all these things together is precisely to avoid what the Democrats did in this election.
[01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:28.652]  Which is to misuse the absentee ballot process and the mail-in ballot process in order to cheat.
[01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.392]  So they really cheated in two respects.
[01:08:32.453 --> 01:08:33.593]  They cheated with the machines.
[01:08:36.833 --> 01:08:58.964]   Instead of asking me, are we going to bring a lawsuit in Wisconsin, which we will if we have to, you should have asked me, and you should be more astounded by the fact that our votes are counted in Germany And in Spain, by a company owned by affiliates of Chavez and Maduro.
[01:09:00.105 --> 01:09:01.446]  Did you ever believe that was true?
[01:09:01.907 --> 01:09:04.629]  Did any of you here believe that that was possible?
[01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:06.230]  Of course it's not.
[01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:07.872]  Of course it shouldn't be possible.
[01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:16.559]  I don't know if we're going to have time to develop all that in time to fill the requirements of all these cases.
[01:09:17.059 --> 01:09:19.101]  We have enough evidence without that to overturn.
[01:09:19.798 --> 01:09:20.358]  This election.
[01:09:20.398 --> 01:09:22.640]  We have it from the affidavits of American citizens.
[01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:26.022]  But that's a matter of national security that we're talking about now.
[01:09:27.103 --> 01:09:29.184]  Very, very serious matter of national security.
[01:09:29.725 --> 01:09:30.705]  Please don't make light of it.
[01:09:31.786 --> 01:09:33.247]  And don't act like you knew it.
[01:09:34.028 --> 01:09:34.988]  Don't act like it isn't a surprise.
[01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:47.457]  That wasn't a surprise right now to cover this historic press conference, but in case anybody in that room is listening, please, for the love of God, give Rudy Giuliani a towel to wipe his shoe polish sweat sideburns off the side of his face.
[01:09:47.477 --> 01:09:48.578]  I'm begging you guys.
[01:09:49.482 --> 01:09:49.802]  Please.
[01:09:50.903 --> 01:09:52.763]  Let's go back to Rudy Giuliani.
[01:09:53.524 --> 01:10:13.693]  The company counting our vote, with control over our vote, is owned by two Venezuelans who were allies of Chavez, are present allies of Maduro, with a company whose chairman is a close associate and business partner of George Soros.
[01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:20.914]  The biggest donor to the Democrat Party, the biggest donor to Antifa, and the biggest donor to Black Lives Matter.
[01:10:21.575 --> 01:10:28.081]  My goodness, what do we have to do to get you to give our people the truth?
[01:10:29.382 --> 01:10:29.562]  Yes.
[01:10:29.962 --> 01:10:33.045]  Thank you, Giuliani, as well as with RSPN.
[01:10:33.506 --> 01:10:34.206]  Do you feel that heat?
[01:10:37.088 --> 01:10:41.009]  The last part was, do they work with defense groups and the CIA?
[01:10:40.929 --> 01:10:45.807]   into Dominion. Can you go further into detail and tell us specifically who those people are?
[01:10:45.807 --> 01:10:51.989]   Also, if it's possible, can you tell us if they work with some of our powerful defense groups in the United States,
[01:10:51.989 --> 01:10:52.809]  such as the CIA?
[01:10:52.809 --> 01:11:00.009]   The last part was, do they work with defense groups and the CIA?
[01:11:00.009 --> 01:11:06.009]   First, I'm in charge of this investigation with Sidney and the people you see here.
[01:11:06.009 --> 01:11:12.009]  There's been no pressure to stop investigating Dominion.
[01:11:12.557 --> 01:11:16.920]  In fact, there's pressure to go as fast as we can.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.183]  I mean, I think there was uniform shock when we first heard it.
[01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.886]  I think when I first heard it, I didn't believe it until Sidney showed me the documents.
[01:11:25.467 --> 01:11:35.955]  And in fact, I feel kind of stupid, and you all should, because all you had to do is go online and find out that Smartmatic is owned by Venezuelans close to Chavez.
[01:11:36.846 --> 01:11:37.488]  You can Google it!
[01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:39.393]  Well, unless they take it down.
[01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:40.336]  I preserved it.
[01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:41.680]  So you can find it.
[01:11:42.362 --> 01:11:44.989]  Not, you know, and by the way, the Coomer character...
[01:11:45.765 --> 01:11:47.806]  You know, we're covering this live.
[01:11:47.826 --> 01:11:48.527]  We're skipping breaks.
[01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:49.988]  This is so historic.
[01:11:50.408 --> 01:11:52.649]  I'm getting a lot of people reaching out to me.
[01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:53.390]  In fact, you know what?
[01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:55.571]  Let me just say that when we come back live, because this is important.
[01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:56.552]  So let's go back to this live.
[01:11:56.752 --> 01:11:58.373]  We're skipping a break right now.
[01:11:58.413 --> 01:12:04.237]  But when we come back and satellite feeds pick us back up on the terrestrial radio and other things, I'm going to make a statement here.
[01:12:04.257 --> 01:12:06.578]  But let's go back and I'm going to make a statement in two seconds here.
[01:12:06.598 --> 01:12:08.179]  That they're going to fix this election.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.463]  I don't know what you need to wake you up to do your job.
[01:12:14.716 --> 01:12:20.260]  And inform the American people, whether you like it or not, of the things they need to know.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.700]  This is real.
[01:12:22.481 --> 01:12:23.382]  It is not made up.
[01:12:23.762 --> 01:12:27.084]  There's nobody here that engages in fantasies.
[01:12:27.784 --> 01:12:28.885]  I've tried a hundred cases.
[01:12:29.485 --> 01:12:32.307]  I prosecuted some of the most dangerous criminals in the world.
[01:12:33.468 --> 01:12:34.288]  I know crimes.
[01:12:34.368 --> 01:12:35.089]  I can smell them.
[01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:36.450]  You don't have to smell this one.
[01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:38.391]  I can prove it to you 18 different ways.
[01:12:39.372 --> 01:12:43.986]   I can prove to you that he won Pennsylvania by 300,000 votes.
[01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:48.469]  I can prove to you that he won Michigan by probably 50,000 votes.
[01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:56.373]  When I went to bed on election night, he was ahead in all those states, every single one of those states.
[01:12:56.794 --> 01:12:58.294]  How is it they all turned around?
[01:12:59.335 --> 01:13:00.636]  Every single one of them turned around?
[01:13:01.616 --> 01:13:03.958]  Or is it more consistent that there was a plan to turn them around?
[01:13:05.198 --> 01:13:14.786]   And since there are witnesses who say there was a plan to turn them around, and it's kind of It begs credulity to say that it all happened in every single state.
[01:13:15.987 --> 01:13:18.169]  My goodness, this is how you win cases in a courtroom.
[01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:19.910]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:21.311]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:22.372 --> 01:13:22.813]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:24.854 --> 01:13:25.335]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:26.896 --> 01:13:27.556]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.339]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:32.740]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:34.362 --> 01:13:34.802]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:36.543 --> 01:13:38.185]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:13:39.466 --> 01:13:42.414]   Sir, is that your What publication are you with?
[01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:46.358]  CNN.
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:54.085]  It's to go around the outrageous iron curtain of censorship and get facts to the American people.
[01:13:54.365 --> 01:13:55.186]  This is beautiful.
[01:13:55.206 --> 01:13:57.949]  We just had a public laughing stock at CNN here.
[01:13:57.989 --> 01:13:59.651]  You've been reporting for the last two weeks.
[01:14:00.852 --> 01:14:01.993]  These are facts.
[01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:04.821]  These are things that actually happened.
[01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:06.802]  These people really wrote these affidavits.
[01:14:07.162 --> 01:14:14.284]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back from what is a skipped break as we're covering this historic landmark press conference here.
[01:14:14.304 --> 01:14:19.785]  But you know, I'm having a lot of people sending me messages, giving me feedback so far from today.
[01:14:19.825 --> 01:14:22.446]  I hosted the Alex Jones Show yesterday with Alex.
[01:14:22.486 --> 01:14:23.326]  I hosted the War Room.
[01:14:24.707 --> 01:14:26.007]  I guess you could say I was kind of on edge.
[01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:28.454]  Uh, we'll just leave it at that.
[01:14:29.075 --> 01:14:32.078]  And people are sending me messages today saying, Owen, you sound a lot better today.
[01:14:32.118 --> 01:14:33.459]  You sound more confident.
[01:14:33.479 --> 01:14:35.542]  You sound a little more cool and collected and calm.
[01:14:35.802 --> 01:14:36.382]  What's going on?
[01:14:36.943 --> 01:14:40.106]  Folks, you have no idea what a big relief this is for me.
[01:14:40.627 --> 01:14:40.907]  Okay?
[01:14:42.829 --> 01:14:48.014]  I just went around the country last week and laid all this information out.
[01:14:48.931 --> 01:14:59.417]  Literally to a T. It's almost like they studied my rallies, my Stop the Steal Caravan rallies, took notes, and then just went and investigated and now are showing all the evidence and getting ready to present it in a legal case.
[01:14:59.877 --> 01:15:02.359]  So, yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.601]  Because it makes me irrelevant.
[01:15:07.822 --> 01:15:13.726]  The fact that we have patriots, the fact that we have lawyers and state representatives and legislatures.
[01:15:14.864 --> 01:15:15.844]  And people in the media.
[01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.425]  And finally, we're coming back.
[01:15:17.485 --> 01:15:18.205]  People are fighting.
[01:15:18.225 --> 01:15:19.606]  They're ready to fight this corruption.
[01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:20.846]  They're ready to call it out.
[01:15:21.007 --> 01:15:21.907]  They're not cowering.
[01:15:22.047 --> 01:15:22.967]  They're not living in fear.
[01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:27.349]  We're publicly laughing at CNN journalists at this press conference.
[01:15:27.729 --> 01:15:28.770]  Thank God!
[01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:30.931]  So yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good.
[01:15:32.191 --> 01:15:33.832]  I'm feeling pretty damn good right now.
[01:15:34.824 --> 01:15:55.444]  When this historic, landmark press conference to save our republic, to save our rigged election, stop the banana republic, stop communist corruption, the fact that this sounds exactly like what InfoWars has been saying for months now, yeah, feels pretty damn good, not gonna lie.
[01:15:56.005 --> 01:15:58.287]  Let's go back live now as they're taking questions.
[01:15:58.347 --> 01:15:59.248]  Sidney Powell at the mic.
[01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:08.375]  Republican or Democratic candidates in any state across the country paid to have the system rigged to work for them.
[01:16:08.796 --> 01:16:11.637]  These people didn't do this just to take control.
[01:16:11.737 --> 01:16:14.299]  They make one heck of a lot of money off of it.
[01:16:14.679 --> 01:16:18.802]  Think about the global interest behind your own news organizations.
[01:16:19.322 --> 01:16:28.628]  Think about the pressure being brought to bear from the social media companies to shut down free speech on any challenge to the election.
[01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:42.253]  This is a massive, well-funded, coordinated effort to deprive we, the people of the United States, of our most fundamental right under the Constitution to preserve this republic that we all cherish.
[01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.835]  It is of the greatest concern.
[01:16:44.654 --> 01:16:54.253]  It is the 1775 of our generation and beyond.
[01:16:54.488 --> 01:16:55.228]  That is true.
[01:16:55.188 --> 01:17:00.106]   being held and processed, tabulated overseas, there's reports that there was a piece of
[01:17:00.106 --> 01:17:05.587]   hardware, possibly a server, picked up in Germany. Is that true and is it related to
[01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:10.467]   this? That is true. It is somehow related to this, but I do not know whether good guys
[01:17:10.467 --> 01:17:16.188]  got it or bad guys got it.
[01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:18.598]  I'm going to take the one with the hands raised.
[01:17:18.438 --> 01:17:24.438]   I can only hear one person at the time. I'm going to take the one with the hands raised.
[01:17:24.438 --> 01:17:25.438]  Yes.
[01:17:25.438 --> 01:17:27.438]  So, question for you, Sunita.
[01:17:27.706 --> 01:17:38.790]  First, on the issue of the machines, do you plan to have, uh, are you seeking a court order to either feed or subpoena or just to gain access to any of these machines in any of these contested districts?
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:42.912]  Have you begun that process, uh, and when can we expect a timeline on that?
[01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:48.534]  And then for you, Mr. Mayor, you mentioned in Wisconsin and in Michigan these issues of overloading.
[01:17:49.174 --> 01:17:51.316]  Where can we learn more about this?
[01:17:51.637 --> 01:17:54.339]  You're saying 150, 200 percent?
[01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:56.561]  Up to 350 percent in some places.
[01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:58.963]  Where would we get access to that data?
[01:17:59.063 --> 01:18:04.228]  And then, to what extent were those people who showed up to vote in person?
[01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:08.372]  Because in Michigan, for example, they did allow same-day registration.
[01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:16.375]  Yes, well the same day registration causes problems with the vote signature and the registration itself.
[01:18:16.436 --> 01:18:22.160]  That's a whole different system that makes it impossible really to validate the signature.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.002]  I mean, one person could sign the same name.
[01:18:25.022 --> 01:18:33.469]  I mean, I could sign John Smith, I could sign Kay Smith, I could sign, you know, both things and run 50 ballots that way.
[01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:36.552]  And we've got some evidence of that being done as well.
[01:18:37.861 --> 01:18:39.422]  Rudy, do you want to speak to the other part of it?
[01:18:39.442 --> 01:18:40.363]  Sure.
[01:18:43.204 --> 01:18:47.686]  We have now three overvote analyses done.
[01:18:48.107 --> 01:18:53.549]  One for Pennsylvania, one for Michigan, and one for Wisconsin.
[01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:55.531]  We're in the process, oh, I'm sorry, Georgia.
[01:18:55.711 --> 01:18:57.772]  We're in the process of doing the others.
[01:19:00.373 --> 01:19:03.995]  I'll check to see if it's appropriate for us to make it public.
[01:19:05.339 --> 01:19:07.381]  I imagine it is, but you could actually do it.
[01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:08.802]  You could do it yourself.
[01:19:09.202 --> 01:19:17.428]  A lot of the analysis comes from the real-time data that came through to the news medias the night and following the election.
[01:19:17.868 --> 01:19:22.051]  And some entrepreneurs out there have started crunching data themselves.
[01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:22.932]  Folks, that's the wild thing.
[01:19:22.972 --> 01:19:23.532]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:19:24.813 --> 01:19:26.535]  This information is publicly available.
[01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:30.057]  You can't go into the archives and basically see how they're obtaining it.
[01:19:30.097 --> 01:19:31.799]  That's what they're saying they're in the process of doing.
[01:19:32.119 --> 01:19:36.002]  But you can see how they have 350% vote turnout.
[01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:40.186]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m.
[01:19:40.206 --> 01:19:41.166]  in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[01:19:41.206 --> 01:19:45.550]  Again, I just did a whole tour on the southeast coast explaining all this.
[01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:56.500]   So yeah, I'm feeling kind of good that these freedom-loving Monsters of law are taking on the deep state, taking on the globalists, trying to save our country.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.081]  Yeah, this is very relieving.
[01:20:00.302 --> 01:20:11.287]  In the vote tallies, in the middle of the night after they've supposedly stopped counting, and that's when the Dominion operators went in and injected votes and changed the whole system.
[01:20:11.667 --> 01:20:24.596]   And it affects votes around the country, around the world, and all kinds of massive interests of globalists, Dictators, corporations, you name it.
[01:20:24.796 --> 01:20:30.118]  Everybody's against us except President Trump and we the people of the United States.
[01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:32.699]  You've spoken of unleashing the Kraken.
[01:20:33.159 --> 01:20:34.440]  Is the country ready for this?
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.842]  I mean, Americans should be astonished at what you're saying here today.
[01:20:38.202 --> 01:20:40.243]  Is the country on the verge of an electoral breakdown?
[01:20:41.103 --> 01:20:41.903]  We've already had it.
[01:20:42.844 --> 01:20:44.705]  We've already had that electoral breakdown.
[01:20:45.145 --> 01:20:49.487]  But the Constitution, as Jenna explains, has provisions in it for how you fix this.
[01:20:50.806 --> 01:20:59.791]  And there should never be another election conducted in this country, I don't care if it's for a local dog catcher, using a Dominion machine and Smartmatic software.
[01:21:00.152 --> 01:21:05.431]   We've got to have an American company that uses paper ballots that we can all verify
[01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:09.831]  so everyone of us can see that our vote is our vote.
[01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:14.231]   Why are you not requesting recounts in Wisconsin counties that use Dominion software?
[01:21:14.231 --> 01:21:18.792]   You're requesting recounts in two counties that don't use the software at all.
[01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:22.231]   This case is not only about, remember this case didn't begin with Dominion.
[01:21:22.748 --> 01:21:25.929]  This case began and this case can be proven the old-fashioned way.
[01:21:26.889 --> 01:21:39.633]  It can be proven based on just good old-fashioned Democratic tactics to go back to Mayor Daley in the 1960s when he held the vote back in Chicago so that he could elect John F. Kennedy.
[01:21:40.436 --> 01:21:52.625]  Or, as recently as last year, when they held the vote back in Palm Beach County and Broward County in order to see if they could steal that election for the Senate and Governor, and then got caught manufacturing ballots.
[01:21:53.225 --> 01:21:55.727]  Democrats have been doing this for years on a small scale.
[01:21:56.447 --> 01:22:10.126]   When they passed the mail-in voter statute, which all of a sudden multiplied by 10 times, The number of mail-in votes, they realized they could have a field day.
[01:22:10.486 --> 01:22:17.190]  They could do precisely what Jimmy Carter and Secretary Baker warned us about.
[01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:22.233]  All you have to do is own an election board, and you can get away with it.
[01:22:22.793 --> 01:22:33.939]  And unlike what Sidney is talking about, where you could have a paper trail, a paper ballot, I tried to point out to you, the minute that you separate the outer envelope from the ballot, you can no longer trace it.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.761]  Which is why the count, whatever the count in Georgia today is, is totally ridiculous.
[01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:41.362]  They're counting the same fraudulent ballots.
[01:22:41.382 --> 01:22:47.483]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, our network feed, the InfoWars network feed is skipping breaks.
[01:22:47.643 --> 01:22:50.944]  Local radio or satellite stations may still be going to those breaks.
[01:22:51.444 --> 01:22:56.706]  So we may be breaking, we'll be right back, but for the InfoWars network feeds, we're skipping breaks and sticking with this historic press conference.
[01:22:58.626 --> 01:23:01.767]  Do you believe you can overturn this election, or is it about something bigger to you?
[01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:04.593]  Well, it is about something.
[01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:08.737]  Let's go from the big picture to the smaller picture.
[01:23:09.458 --> 01:23:17.905]  The most important thing here is that this has been a massive attack on the integrity of the voting system and the greatest democracy on earth.
[01:23:18.766 --> 01:23:26.012]  The people who did this have committed one of the worst crimes that I've ever seen or observed.
[01:23:26.513 --> 01:23:33.410]   One of the things we're the most proud of in this country Is that we've been such a long-standing democracy based on the right to vote.
[01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.371]  They have trashed the right to vote.
[01:23:36.752 --> 01:23:37.992]  They've dishonored the right to vote.
[01:23:38.232 --> 01:23:41.294]  They've destroyed the right to vote in their greed for power and money.
[01:23:42.194 --> 01:23:43.135]  And there's no doubt about it.
[01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:48.538]  This was not an individual idea of 10 or 12 Democrat bosses.
[01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:50.399]  This is a plan.
[01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:53.080]  You would have to be a fool not to realize that.
[01:23:53.911 --> 01:24:01.633]  They do the same thing, in exactly the same way, in 10 big, Democrat-controlled, in most cases, crooked city.
[01:24:02.013 --> 01:24:13.715]  And when I say crooked city, go look at how many of their officials have gone to jail in the last 20, or 30, or 40, or 50, or 60 years that they have dominated and destroyed those cities.
[01:24:14.955 --> 01:24:17.216]  They picked the places where they could get away with it.
[01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:24.080]   They picked the places where Whether or not Republicans testified to something, judges would just dismiss it.
[01:24:24.901 --> 01:24:26.662]  Because judges are appointed politically.
[01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:29.164]  And too many of them are hacks.
[01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:37.350]  They pick places where they could get a sheriff that refused to enforce a court order.
[01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:44.991]   When we got a court order that we could be 10 feet closer, our representatives were told, if you try to do it, I'll
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:45.551]  arrest you.
[01:24:45.551 --> 01:24:51.790]   You're painting a portrait of a national conspiracy, suggesting that Joe Biden was
[01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:52.911]  actually part of that.
[01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:58.511]  Part one, part one, it began as a national conspiracy.
[01:24:58.733 --> 01:25:01.154]  Clearly, that evidence emerged very, very quickly.
[01:25:01.774 --> 01:25:11.017]  The minute I saw that it was the same thing in 10 states, just using logic, I said this can't be an accident.
[01:25:11.598 --> 01:25:14.299]  And then what I was surprised about is the dimension of it.
[01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:20.668]   I mean, not inspecting almost 700,000 ballots is astounding.
[01:25:20.668 --> 01:25:24.668]   Are you suggesting that Joe Biden was part of that conspiracy?
[01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:25.949]  I just wonder what your evidence is.
[01:25:25.949 --> 01:25:29.229]   Honestly, I don't know what Joe Biden is aware of or not aware of.
[01:25:29.455 --> 01:25:34.358]  And I mean that as a lawyer, not trying to be not trying to be cute.
[01:25:34.898 --> 01:25:35.478]  I've watched him.
[01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:36.199]  I've observed him.
[01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:41.761]  I honestly don't know how much he's aware.
[01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:44.943]  I don't know how much he decides and how much things are decided for him.
[01:25:45.436 --> 01:25:49.579]  So I... Let me address one other thing to your question about the process.
[01:25:49.739 --> 01:25:53.162]  Your question is fundamentally flawed when you're asking where is the evidence.
[01:25:53.442 --> 01:25:56.124]  You clearly don't understand the legal process.
[01:25:56.184 --> 01:26:03.189]  What we have asked for in the court is to not have the certification of false results.
[01:26:03.849 --> 01:26:09.018]  And so to say hold on a minute, we have evidence that we will present to the court.
[01:26:09.438 --> 01:26:13.064]  We haven't had the opportunity yet to present that to the court.
[01:26:13.124 --> 01:26:21.273]   We're giving you an overview and a preview of what we've discovered, but no court yet has We've had that opportunity.
[01:26:21.433 --> 01:26:24.415]  And we have fraud allegations pending.
[01:26:24.435 --> 01:26:30.140]  So what we've asked for are temporary restraining orders or injunctions to not certify false results.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:42.009]  We're very happy that Michigan, the reason we dismissed that lawsuit today, is because the Michigan County in Wayne County, they're not going to certify that because 71% of counties have inconsistent data.
[01:26:42.329 --> 01:26:47.873]   No person in this room or in this country We have to make sure that the results are accurate.
[01:26:47.693 --> 01:26:50.972]  a president with false results.
[01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:53.532]  We have to make sure that the results are accurate.
[01:26:53.532 --> 01:26:54.653]  That's what we will prove.
[01:26:54.653 --> 01:26:55.293]  Two more questions.
[01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:57.932]   The Secretary of State says that that can't actually happen,
[01:26:57.932 --> 01:27:01.853]   that those votes can't be rescinded and that the certification in Michigan currently stands.
[01:27:01.853 --> 01:27:03.092]  Secretary of State where?
[01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:03.972]  In Michigan.
[01:27:03.972 --> 01:27:06.092]  Yeah, well, there are problems in Michigan.
[01:27:06.092 --> 01:27:08.333]  Follow the money.
[01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.891]  Follow the political party, ma'am.
[01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.333]  I mean, you're actually serious?
[01:27:12.333 --> 01:27:17.453]   Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, and others, they say they're gonna take two more questions
[01:27:17.453 --> 01:27:32.570]   When When the Secretary of State of Michigan never bothered to find out that the votes in her state were being counted in Germany by a Venezuelan company, and you want me to take her seriously or him seriously?
[01:27:33.851 --> 01:27:35.411]  I mean, I was in government.
[01:27:37.391 --> 01:27:41.072]  If I were the governor of that state, I'd fire everybody that was involved in this election.
[01:27:41.812 --> 01:27:57.904]  They didn't come and tell me that my state was going to be embarrassed, made a fool of, because I'm sending my votes of people in Michigan over to Germany to be counted by a company that is owned by people who are allies of Maduro and Chavez.
[01:27:58.525 --> 01:28:01.507]  By the way, Carolyn Maloney, who wrote that, is my Congresswoman.
[01:28:02.628 --> 01:28:03.848]  A Democrat pointed that out.
[01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:08.372]  They didn't do the darndest bit of due diligence.
[01:28:09.378 --> 01:28:13.919]  If you bought a $10 million company, you would have done more due diligence for that.
[01:28:14.899 --> 01:28:17.619]  Maybe they're incompetent, or maybe they didn't want to know.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:25.181]  But you're not going to have me take seriously anything that comes from anyone involved in the election the way it was conducted in Michigan.
[01:28:25.201 --> 01:28:28.721]  But you guys are saying that those votes have been rescinded.
[01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:29.042]  They haven't.
[01:28:29.082 --> 01:28:31.222]  The Secretary of State there said that they can't be.
[01:28:31.242 --> 01:28:33.402]  The Secretary of State can say whatever she wants to say.
[01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:34.462]  Of course she's going to say that.
[01:28:34.763 --> 01:28:35.503]  She's a Democrat.
[01:28:36.183 --> 01:28:39.658]   She could also credit The affidavits of the two people.
[01:28:40.579 --> 01:28:43.621]  And say that the board is tied and therefore the vote hasn't been certified.
[01:28:44.382 --> 01:28:46.403]  So because she's a Democrat, she's saying that.
[01:28:47.884 --> 01:28:49.285]  Do you think she has any credibility?
[01:28:49.786 --> 01:28:52.007]  Having run the kind of election they ran in Michigan?
[01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:55.450]  You think anyone in that government has credibility?
[01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:59.153]  After using a machine and fooling their citizens?
[01:28:59.373 --> 01:29:04.857]  There can't be a person in Michigan who thought their vote was being sent outside the United States so somebody could play with it.
[01:29:06.283 --> 01:29:10.486]  I mean, it's just... And by the way, the Gateway Pundit has now published the numbers they've been reporting.
[01:29:10.946 --> 01:29:17.850]  Folks, in all these counties, the vote comes back from overseas and it's the exact same ratio split, the exact same percentage split.
[01:29:18.171 --> 01:29:20.772]  A literal zero percent possibility.
[01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:25.855]  Are you going to have to see what, when, where?
[01:29:25.895 --> 01:29:26.296]  We're not.
[01:29:26.956 --> 01:29:28.637]  We are limited in what we can do.
[01:29:28.657 --> 01:29:29.618]  We're not the FBI.
[01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:30.819]  We're not the government.
[01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:33.080]  We don't have that kind of subpoena power.
[01:29:33.877 --> 01:29:36.319]  We don't have the power to just go subpoena anything we want.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.540]  The government does.
[01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:42.185]  We would have to subpoena in line with a case.
[01:29:42.985 --> 01:29:48.450]  Our first case, we're asking for that authority in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
[01:29:49.811 --> 01:29:51.453]  But you have to get that authority from the court.
[01:29:51.493 --> 01:29:52.354]  We're private citizens.
[01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:53.114]  We're not the government.
[01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:59.220]  If I were the government, like I used to be, there'd probably be a lot of people arrested by now.
[01:30:01.121 --> 01:30:02.522]  Because there's plenty of probable cause.
[01:30:02.983 --> 01:30:04.983]  plenty of probable cause.
[01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.983]  [inaudible]
[01:30:06.983 --> 01:30:08.983]  [inaudible]
[01:30:08.983 --> 01:30:10.983]  [inaudible]
[01:30:10.983 --> 01:30:14.983]   You alleged that Donald Trump has won by a landslide.
[01:30:14.983 --> 01:30:18.983]   We've seen that a lot of your lawsuits
[01:30:18.983 --> 01:30:22.983]   and in fact lawyers have been dropping like flies. What do you say to those people
[01:30:22.983 --> 01:30:26.983]   who call this a Russia 2.0 just on the other side?
[01:30:26.983 --> 01:30:28.983]  Why didn't this and also why didn't this happen?
[01:30:28.983 --> 01:30:30.983]  What fake network do you come from?
[01:30:31.604 --> 01:30:33.685]  I don't come from a fake network.
[01:30:33.785 --> 01:30:35.746]  In fact, I am completely independent.
[01:30:35.766 --> 01:30:36.887]  I have no one above my head.
[01:30:37.087 --> 01:30:37.727]  Oh my goodness.
[01:30:38.047 --> 01:30:42.349]  Well, first of all, first of all, our cases haven't been dismissed.
[01:30:42.609 --> 01:30:46.871]  We only have... Look at the plaintiffs who were involved in this.
[01:30:46.931 --> 01:30:48.112]  It's not our case, ma'am.
[01:30:48.752 --> 01:30:49.753]  Don't lie to people.
[01:30:51.193 --> 01:30:53.834]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you are lying.
[01:30:54.635 --> 01:30:55.435]  You're lying.
[01:30:56.216 --> 01:30:56.916]  You're lying.
[01:30:58.348 --> 01:30:59.309]  Well, continue to lie.
[01:30:59.349 --> 01:31:02.552]  I'm not going to... Ma'am.
[01:31:02.612 --> 01:31:02.872]  Ma'am.
[01:31:04.594 --> 01:31:04.854]  Ma'am.
[01:31:05.254 --> 01:31:05.474]  Ma'am.
[01:31:05.795 --> 01:31:06.115]  Okay.
[01:31:06.455 --> 01:31:07.496]  Let me answer the question.
[01:31:07.516 --> 01:31:09.358]  Let me answer the question.
[01:31:09.818 --> 01:31:13.221]  The answer to the question is, we don't have a lot of lawsuits.
[01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:14.222]  We only have three.
[01:31:14.843 --> 01:31:17.765]  Our lawsuits have not been dropped all over the place.
[01:31:18.266 --> 01:31:21.588]  We... Okay.
[01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.350]  Well, you're a totally discourteous person.
[01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:24.471]  I'm going to finish my answer.
[01:31:27.675 --> 01:31:28.635]  I'm going to finish my answer.
[01:31:28.676 --> 01:31:30.517]  The fact is we have very, very few lawsuits.
[01:31:30.557 --> 01:31:34.140]  The lawsuits you're talking about have been brought by private individuals and groups.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.762]  Most of them were dismissed for lack of standing.
[01:31:37.383 --> 01:31:40.926]  Probably correctly, because they were brought before the election took place.
[01:31:41.606 --> 01:31:42.807]  The election is now over.
[01:31:43.328 --> 01:31:48.432]  The only lawsuit we have withdrawn is the one where we got the release that we wanted, and that's the one in Michigan.
[01:31:48.692 --> 01:31:53.576]  We also have another lawsuit in Michigan that will accomplish the other objectives of what we want to do in Michigan.
[01:31:53.976 --> 01:31:55.858]  So it's silly to have two competing lawsuits.
[01:31:56.613 --> 01:32:00.397]  The only lawyer that left a case left because he was threatened.
[01:32:00.957 --> 01:32:02.018]  His family was threatened.
[01:32:02.258 --> 01:32:03.399]  His children were threatened.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.261]  And so was the other lawyer.
[01:32:06.022 --> 01:32:06.722]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:32:06.862 --> 01:32:25.384]   We have a little difficulty getting lawyers because our lawyers get threatened with being killed because of the ridiculous way in which you cover this and the ridiculous way in which you cover I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about everybody, but I get a pretty good sense from the way you handle yourself, how you cover it.
[01:32:25.884 --> 01:32:27.104]  Alright, we're finished with you now.
[01:32:27.744 --> 01:32:28.765]  One last question.
[01:32:29.445 --> 01:32:33.026]  One last question from a... One last question.
[01:32:34.266 --> 01:32:35.546]  One last question.
[01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:37.387]  One last question.
[01:32:37.827 --> 01:32:39.788]  From a reasonable, civil person.
[01:32:40.448 --> 01:32:40.868]  You are not.
[01:32:41.008 --> 01:32:41.168]  Yes.
[01:32:42.893 --> 01:32:43.614]  No, she isn't.
[01:32:44.154 --> 01:32:44.975]  Well, we'll find out.
[01:32:44.995 --> 01:32:47.436]  I'm from the Daily Caller, for the record.
[01:32:47.476 --> 01:32:47.897]  Oh, there we go.
[01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:54.681]  If the courts don't let you present these cases like Jenna just said, will you give the entire bulk of the evidence to the media to review?
[01:32:55.242 --> 01:33:00.125]  And if so, when are you going to drag this thing out like the Hunter Biden hard drive again?
[01:33:01.471 --> 01:33:02.752]  We're not going to drag it out.
[01:33:02.812 --> 01:33:05.874]  I mean, it's ridiculous for you to say we're dragging it out.
[01:33:06.494 --> 01:33:12.338]  Al Gore had a lot more time than we've had, and we've had two weeks to investigate.
[01:33:12.758 --> 01:33:15.900]  So that's also completely unfair to say we're dragging it out.
[01:33:16.661 --> 01:33:21.684]  Also, if we're going to present things in court, if we present it to you, judges are not going to be very happy with us.
[01:33:22.024 --> 01:33:28.929]  And finally, I have to tell you, our witnesses don't want to be exposed to the tender mercies of a vicious press.
[01:33:29.947 --> 01:33:34.489]  I have great difficulty getting those witnesses that I did reveal to allow me to do it.
[01:33:35.069 --> 01:33:35.849]  They don't trust you.
[01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.870]  They don't like you.
[01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:43.132]  They think you put their lives in jeopardy with the spin that you put on what's going on here and with the unfairness in which you cover it.
[01:33:43.692 --> 01:33:46.814]  It's not easy to reveal the things that they tell me.
[01:33:46.834 --> 01:33:47.474]  So the answer is no?
[01:33:47.834 --> 01:33:54.977]  The answer is I can't do it because I can't I can't put a witness's life in jeopardy or a person who thinks there's life in jeopardy.
[01:33:55.237 --> 01:33:57.698]  This woman tells me we have lawyers dropping out of the case.
[01:33:58.484 --> 01:34:06.868]  We have lawyers dropping out of the case because they're being threatened with destruction of their careers, destruction of their livelihood, and in some cases, destruction of their lives.
[01:34:07.348 --> 01:34:12.931]  That comes about because of the hysterical way in which you have covered Donald Trump and his administration.
[01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:14.611]  But we're going to change all that.
[01:34:15.071 --> 01:34:15.952]  We're going to go to courts.
[01:34:16.052 --> 01:34:17.072]  We're going to prove it in court.
[01:34:17.833 --> 01:34:20.014]  I would love to release all the information that I have.
[01:34:20.274 --> 01:34:21.394]  I would love to give it to you all.
[01:34:22.355 --> 01:34:24.015]  Except, most of you wouldn't cover it.
[01:34:24.376 --> 01:34:25.076]  A few of you would.
[01:34:25.842 --> 01:34:28.263]  And then we'd have half the American people probably informed.
[01:34:28.724 --> 01:34:39.049]  The censorship that is going on in this country right now by big tech and by big media is almost as dangerous as the election fraud that we're revealing.
[01:34:39.389 --> 01:34:40.390]  Maybe just as dangerous.
[01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:42.351]  We're headed to a very bad place.
[01:34:42.991 --> 01:34:47.174]  And it is not inappropriate that a Venezuelan company countered our votes.
[01:34:47.694 --> 01:34:48.054]  Thank you.
[01:34:52.417 --> 01:34:52.737]  Wow!
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.781]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:57.061 --> 01:34:59.242]  That was incredible.
[01:35:00.363 --> 01:35:01.323]  That was historic.
[01:35:01.623 --> 01:35:03.404]  That is going to resonate worldwide.
[01:35:04.345 --> 01:35:13.409]  That was a meteor impact level on the American body politic and the world.
[01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:16.191]  And this is just the beginning.
[01:35:19.412 --> 01:35:20.273]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:35:21.373 --> 01:35:22.774]  We've skipped all of our breaks.
[01:35:23.743 --> 01:35:24.683]  We need to pay the bills.
[01:35:26.764 --> 01:35:36.867]  When we come back, I'm going to go through all of the notes here that I took listening to that press conference and lay it all out and what it means and what's coming next.
[01:35:38.408 --> 01:35:46.330]  But we got to take the first break that we've taken today because we've just been covering this historic press conference with Trump's legal team and wow.
[01:35:49.751 --> 01:35:56.386]   I mean, I even need a minute to just kind of Gather my feet here, but folks.
[01:35:59.727 --> 01:36:00.488]  That's just incredible.
[01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:01.168]  I can't even.
[01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:02.809]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:04.609]  We haven't even plugged today.
[01:36:04.689 --> 01:36:05.610]  We've been skipping breaks.
[01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:15.574]  We've now funded and launched this whole stop the steel caravan that's been going on for two weeks now with with Jones rallying people in Atlanta going to be out there again Saturday.
[01:36:15.914 --> 01:36:18.115]  I think I'm going to be rallying again Saturday here in Austin.
[01:36:18.135 --> 01:36:20.156]  In fact, I might as well just admit just come out and say it.
[01:36:20.336 --> 01:36:23.137]  We're going to be doing it again Saturday here at the state Capitol in Austin.
[01:36:24.117 --> 01:36:25.018]  They did it last Saturday.
[01:36:25.038 --> 01:36:25.558]  It was huge.
[01:36:25.718 --> 01:36:26.879]  We didn't even do it or promote it.
[01:36:27.059 --> 01:36:28.220]  I'll be out there Saturday.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:29.481]  Come out and join me.
[01:36:29.521 --> 01:36:30.882]  State Capitol here in Austin at noon.

[01:37:04.176 --> 01:37:08.176]   The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[01:37:08.176 --> 01:37:09.176]  Don't let them win.

[01:37:51.404 --> 01:37:52.104]  Selling out quickly.
[01:37:52.164 --> 01:37:53.065]  I'm gonna say this right now.
[01:37:53.145 --> 01:37:54.485]  We called in Anthroplex.
[01:37:54.665 --> 01:37:56.806]  Super strong booster bodies.
[01:37:57.526 --> 01:38:01.367]  You know, natural test, boost all these things that's so good for your immunity.
[01:38:01.607 --> 01:38:03.188]  Nothing does that like boosting your test.
[01:38:04.068 --> 01:38:07.309]  It was a bestseller under Androplex, but somebody had a copyright.
[01:38:07.349 --> 01:38:07.989]  They threatened this.
[01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:09.670]  So I changed the name to Alpha Power.
[01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.431]  Super strong, super high quality.
[01:38:11.451 --> 01:38:13.291]  We haven't had this in a year because I waited.
[01:38:13.391 --> 01:38:16.572]  And then by the time COVID hit, we couldn't get it in the high quality version.
[01:38:16.652 --> 01:38:17.693]  It finally was available.
[01:38:17.753 --> 01:38:19.773]  And the company told us that we're getting the supply from.
[01:38:19.813 --> 01:38:21.094]  We may go out of business.
[01:38:21.934 --> 01:38:26.598]  Because of the total lockdown, you better put in a bigger order if you ever want to get it again.
[01:38:26.838 --> 01:38:28.040]  We may close in the new year.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:30.161]  Now, why is this product special?
[01:38:30.221 --> 01:38:31.162]  What is in this?
[01:38:31.403 --> 01:38:31.963]  What does it do?
[01:38:32.023 --> 01:38:36.407]  Well, it's got a bunch of things in it, but it's got these proprietary ingredients.
[01:38:36.787 --> 01:38:46.396]  LJ-100, urecoma, long phalangea, organic maca, horny goat weed, tribulus, fruit extract, rice grain concentrate, niacin, and zinc.
[01:38:46.496 --> 01:38:48.757]  By the way, we were putting zinc in this before we put zinc in things.
[01:38:48.777 --> 01:38:49.218]  They're cool.
[01:38:49.238 --> 01:38:51.159]  Zinc just supercharges everything you do.

[01:39:13.609 --> 01:39:16.570]  As much as I'm stressed out, as much as I fight, as much as I do, I could not operate.

[01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:19.470]  When I forget to take them, I feel it.
[01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:20.230]  Now, it's expensive.
[01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:24.351]  DNA Force Plus is expensive because PQQ and CoQ10 of the high-quality forms are very expensive.
[01:39:24.371 --> 01:39:27.431]  You can't find formulas with anywhere near this dose for anywhere near this price.

[01:41:11.518 --> 01:41:14.637]  Leading competitors have 3 to 5 percent.
