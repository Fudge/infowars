[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:11.576]  This strike is going to be remembered as one of the most effective military strikes in the last 20 years as far as the far-reaching implications it will have.
[00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:23.543]  For all intents and purposes, the United States is now at war with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
[00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:29.731]  Whether you support that, whether you hate that, whether you're neutral about that, that's what's happening.
[00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:31.813]  As you know, a few days ago, the U.S.
[00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:37.156]  Embassy, the Green Zone in Baghdad got overrun by Iranian militias.
[00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:43.940]  As you know, the Iranians have been involved in a lot of provocative activities in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.423]  There's a big proxy war between the West via Saudi Arabia and Iran going on right now.
[00:00:50.704 --> 00:01:09.651]   The facts are, That just a few hours ago, the head of the Iranian military and the head of the Iranian militia, which is Hezbollah, which is a Shiite revolutionary force all over the world, were meeting in Baghdad at a tarmac.
[00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:19.220]  And as they came together, a missile or a bomb landed between them, killing them and other leadership of the Iranian military.
[00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.990]  I told you this years ago and it's been confirmed.
[00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.470]  Iran has sleeper cells all over the West.
[00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.991]  Real groups that can carry out terror attacks.
[00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.812]  And they're promising responses back to the West right now.
[00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:37.174]  But the fact that this happened means that we are in a state of war with Iran.
[00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:52.090]   What we do know is they're reporting that Iranian top general Qasem Soleimani, who's the head of the main military and the head of the militia, which is their paramilitary force around the world, is dead.
[00:01:53.351 --> 00:02:01.814]  And Iran has major sleeper cells, as we've reported years ago, and is now being reported in the mainstream media across the Western world.
[00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:04.375]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:11.198]  There is a Shiite-Sunni civil war going on in the Middle East and around the world, and this has exploded.
[00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.932]  I have talked to a lot of my military sources and I was getting calls at 5 a.m.
[00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:20.233]  this morning saying the U.S.
[00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:22.813]  is committed, it's on, it's going kinetic.
[00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:24.734]  And I went on air and I said that today.
[00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:32.156]  And then during the show I got texts and I said, hey it's on, that the U.S.
[00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:36.698]  is committed, Marines are going in, they've got assets in the air, and now this happens.
[00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:39.399]  This is not like taking over Iraq.
[00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.689]   This is not like What we've seen in other Middle Eastern countries, this is Iran.
[00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.992]  These are Persians and this is going to be a very dangerous situation.
[00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:54.875]  So one of my military sources that I've talked to, I'm going to call him right now.
[00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:57.477]  We're not going to say, we're not going to say his name.
[00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:05.442]  He's going to tell you some of the things that he's talked about with his sources and why this is so serious.
[00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:07.163]  And I'm going to leave it at that, but we've talked to.
[00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:17.538]  Generals, we've talked to people down at the Special Operations level before this even happened and since this happened, they said this is going kinetic in a big way.
[00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:18.418]  It's already gone kinetic.
[00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.661]  So let's go ahead and make this call to one of my sources.
[00:03:24.263 --> 00:03:24.503]  Hello.
[00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:26.985]  Hey, I'm not going to say your name.
[00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:34.911]  You're just one of the folks we've talked to tonight, but if you could just repeat some of the things you and your sources have basically ascertained about how serious this is for some of the viewers.
[00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:45.641]  Well, this is obviously very, very big news that the commander of the Quds Forces and the Popular Mobilization Forces over there have been killed.
[00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:58.368]  Now, if this is true, and the reason I say if, especially with Soleimani, there have been numerous reports in the past of him being killed, and those reports prove not to be true.
[00:03:58.508 --> 00:04:17.137]   However, this time there appears to be confirmation from the Iraqis themselves Three senior Iraqi officials have stated that they saw the ring that the Major General is known to wear, that they saw that on the charred body, and that they confirmed through that that it was him.
[00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:24.960]  So if that's true, a lot of people are already saying this is bigger than the killing of Osama bin Laden.
[00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:29.358]  This is bigger than Baghdadi from ISIS.
[00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:38.860]  This is huge because the Quds, of course, are a central part of the Iranian military apparatus.
[00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.602]  And the Major General had been listed as a terrorist by the U.S.
[00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.483]  So this is a huge blow to Iran.
[00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:55.648]  And while it's good news in many ways, it also escalates the situation over there now.
[00:04:56.508 --> 00:05:09.537]  There is no doubt that Iran will have to respond in a spectacular fashion to these two deaths if they want to maintain the loyalty of their military.
[00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:22.527]  If they don't, the Iranian leadership knows they're looking at a possible coup within their own country because the military will turn on them if they don't retaliate for the killing of their commanders.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.505]  So this is very huge, as big as it gets, and probably the most significant event to happen in the Middle East in the last 20 years.
[00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:38.590]  I was told by my sources today that it was going to go kinetic, and now that's certainly happened.
[00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.374]  And regardless of what side quote people are on, this has already been initiated, as you said.
[00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:51.919]  And the different ways the Iranian militia or Hezbollah embedded around the world could respond is very, very serious.
[00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:55.818]  They're always acting covertly and then not taking responsibility.
[00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:56.658]  The U.S.
[00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:57.899]  is not taking responsibility.
[00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.639]  A lot of U.S.
[00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.459]  publications are saying the U.S.
[00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:01.379]  killed these guys.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.942]  That's probably who did kill them, but I don't think you can safely say who did it exactly just because mainstream media is saying so.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.841]  Well, and that's true, and that's a good point.
[00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.683]  However, I don't think that's going to matter to the Iranians.
[00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:30.972]  The Iranians have already, not the Iranians, but their Shia-backed militias in Iran have already made statements that the American and Jewish and Israeli enemy are responsible for this.
[00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:40.858]  So they are already laying the groundwork to their people to rise up against the Americans and by proxy to the Israelis as well.
[00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:48.197]  And let's be clear, this isn't going to just be like Iraq, which should have a very competent international network.
[00:06:48.217 --> 00:06:52.423]  The Iranians have a very strong international terrorist network.
[00:06:53.643 --> 00:07:05.711]  Absolutely, and not only that, there's a lot of allegiances, you know, both overtly and covertly that Iran has over there in the Middle East.
[00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:16.098]  They have very strong backing, and they have emerged over the last 10 years as one of the preeminent power players in that region, and they're not backing down.
[00:07:16.218 --> 00:07:17.559]  They're not going to back down from this.
[00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:23.523]  This is an escalation that's going to draw a lot more countries in before it's said and done.
[00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:27.612]  Talking to your sources, if you could just repeat some of the things you said.
[00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:31.699]  I mean, they're saying there's no way to ratchet this down right now.
[00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.363]  I mean, they're expecting this is just going to really just escalate.
[00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:42.159]  Yeah, at this point, it's beyond trying to say, hey, let cooler heads prevail.
[00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:43.600]  That ship has sailed.
[00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:55.687]  I talked to a former retired Brigadier General just a few minutes ago, and he has said this has definitely crossed a line as far as Iran is concerned.
[00:07:56.428 --> 00:08:04.933]  And for them to maintain control in the region, at least among their own people, they're going to have to retaliate.
[00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:06.493]  There's no, there's...
[00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:14.673]  And to repeat what we talked about, this is really a miscalculation by Iran because they thought Trump was Obama or others.
[00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:16.074]  They've been doing this a long time.
[00:08:16.114 --> 00:08:17.455]  Why would they dare fly into Iraq?
[00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:20.716]  Why would they be, you know, trying to stage an uprising in Iraq?
[00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:30.241]  I mean, regardless of which side people are on here, and I'm neutral, and I mean, I want peace like President Trump said, but he said this is not, this is not a warning.
[00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:30.981]  This is a threat.
[00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:33.603]  I mean, this takes it into a whole other level.
[00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:54.337]   As you said, they're going to say the United States This strike is going to be remembered as one of the most effective military strikes in the last 20 years as far as the far-reaching implications it will have.
[00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:08.427]   I don't think there's ever been a time that we remember here on this War on Terror Where a person, a terrorist, takes place in an assault on a U.S.
[00:09:08.567 --> 00:09:15.858]  embassy and within 24 hours is killed by a U.S.
[00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:17.560]  strike, if it was a U.S.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.881]  strike.
[00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.855]  I mean, the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces was at the U.S.
[00:09:24.936 --> 00:09:42.471]  Embassy during that attack, during that attempt to breach the embassy, and here we are 24 hours later, not only is he killed, but one of the most powerful men in Iran's military apparatus is killed along with him.
[00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:47.599]   And those are just the two Sure, so the message is the U.S.
[00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:51.645]  isn't playing games anymore and that means Iran really miscalculated.
[00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:54.202]  Absolutely they did.
[00:09:54.522 --> 00:10:14.974]  You can look back on Benghazi, you can look back on all these different situations, all the way back to the Arab Spring, where we continuously allowed these mobs to be stirred up by the Iranians and thrown against our sovereign institutions over there in that region.
[00:10:15.774 --> 00:10:18.896]  And there were no repercussions.
[00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:21.898]  And now that game has changed overnight.
[00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:25.679]  And it's changed in a very, very dramatic way.
[00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:33.041]  They didn't just kill some small cell leader who was out there, you know, burning the flag.
[00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:38.723]  They killed the two most powerful men in that entire region.
[00:10:39.383 --> 00:10:42.944]  That's right, the real people running, the real military dictatorship running around.
[00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:48.670]   So, regardless of what quote geopolitical side people are on, it's on It's happening.
[00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.415]  In closing, how do we think Iran is going to respond?
[00:10:52.455 --> 00:10:54.038]  Because they always retaliate.
[00:10:56.149 --> 00:10:56.669]  Absolutely.
[00:10:56.729 --> 00:11:00.672]  Well, I don't think there's just going to be one response.
[00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:03.694]  I think there's going to be a combination of responses.
[00:11:04.114 --> 00:11:14.841]  I look for very likely heavy, heavy mining in the Straits of Hormuz, trying to shut the Straits down to shut the oil supply down.
[00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:19.845]  I think they might even already now be dropping mines into the water.
[00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:23.507]  I think that's definitely one of the things they're going to look at.
[00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:29.931]  But I also look at further attacks on our installations over there where we have service members.
[00:11:31.071 --> 00:11:34.593]  They're going to want to be able to show their people that they've killed Americans.
[00:11:35.854 --> 00:11:46.460]  And then I think there's also a lesser possibility of a strike against Israel, since they're already trying to lay the groundwork that Israel and the U.S.
[00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:47.261]  were behind.
[00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:50.182]  Sure, draw Israel in to unify other Islamic countries.
[00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:51.843]  What about sleeper cells?
[00:11:51.883 --> 00:11:54.004]  What about sleeper cells?
[00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:58.806]  Yeah, and I think that's one thing we're going to have to look for here in the U.S.
[00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:10.931]  is, you know, not just overseas, but now I also think that they will definitely put heavy pressure on these sleeper cells to wake up and start carrying out attacks.
[00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:18.149]  Well, they definitely miscalculated because Iran officially tried to overthrow that embassy, took over a lot of it.
[00:12:18.589 --> 00:12:19.550]  That's an act of war.
[00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.951]  I don't want war, but you're right.
[00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:24.272]  The appeasement of Iran has gone on and on and on.
[00:12:25.493 --> 00:12:29.475]  And now Trump has said, don't cross these red lines.
[00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:30.756]  He was trying to get us out of the Middle East.
[00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:32.277]  And they took that as weakness.
[00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:33.998]  I think that was a major miscalculation.
[00:12:34.418 --> 00:12:37.640]  We'll be covering it all live here on air throughout tonight and tomorrow.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.020]  We're up here.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.522]  No, except that appeasement ended tonight, officially.
[00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.821]  But keep talking to your sources.
[00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:45.541]  You're a great source for us here at Infowars.
[00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:47.981]  Any other points you'd like to make in closing?
[00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:52.901]  No, except that appeasement ended tonight, officially.
[00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:58.501]   And I think this day, this event will be remembered for a long time because I think the repercussions
[00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.901]  of it are going to be felt probably for years to come.
[00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.901]  And I agree.
[00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:04.901]  Don't you think North Korea is taking notice?
[00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:05.901]  Absolutely.
[00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:09.541]  And I think you're going to see a change there.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:30.230]   I think they're watching this very closely and depending on how this plays out but like I said I would not be surprised if within the next few weeks we don't see major strikes going on inside Iran and us unfortunately being Well, that's what I was told by my sources, is the Marines, the Army, everything's on max alert.
[00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.911]  They're pouring troops in right now.
[00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:35.053]  Obviously, that's not on the news, but they're ready for an Iranian response.
[00:13:35.113 --> 00:13:39.996]  If the Iranians are dumb enough to try something openly, I think they're going to get destroyed like Japan.
[00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:56.205]  I think they're miscalculating the current president, and he's already served notice to them that he's not doing things the way his predecessor did, and we'll see what Iran does.
[00:13:56.285 --> 00:14:02.009]  But again, I think they're backed into a corner now, because I don't think they can back down even if they wanted to.
[00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:07.012]  They've painted themselves into this corner, and they're going to have to fight this through to the end.
[00:14:09.013 --> 00:14:09.434]  All right.
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:10.194]  Well, thank you.
[00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:11.235]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:14:12.628 --> 00:14:12.848]  Absolutely.
[00:14:12.908 --> 00:14:13.248]  Thank you.
[00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:14.489]  All right, folks.
[00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:19.171]  Well, that's a smart guy that did just talk to some high-level sources, and he's been involved in a lot of different government agencies and things.
[00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:19.771]  We'll leave it at that.
[00:14:21.272 --> 00:14:22.212]  I don't want war with Iran.
[00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:23.653]  President Trump said he wanted peace.
[00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:32.316]  But Iran's working with Kerry and Obama and Hillary and the deep state to embarrass America and to pull us into this crisis.
[00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:36.818]  And so that's really what's happening here is the deep state has tried to impeach Trump.
[00:14:36.838 --> 00:14:37.899]  They've tried to remove Trump.
[00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:39.659]  They've tried the Russiagate crap.
[00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:41.180]  They've tried the Ukraine crap.
[00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:47.217]  They've tried all this, and now they're working with Iran to try to embarrass Trump in the U.S., and it's not going to go well.
[00:14:47.777 --> 00:14:51.699]  So they've all petted themselves into a corner, and I back the president.
[00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:55.200]  I pray for peace, but we're going to be covering this all live.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.621]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:02.443]  We've got big stories up at Infowars.com, and we'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow morning to cover this live.
[00:15:02.463 --> 00:15:02.723]  Thank you.
[00:15:03.562 --> 00:15:07.584]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:08.984]  You don't want my thanks.
[00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:15.547]  You want victory over the Globalists and these devil-worshipping child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[00:15:15.807 --> 00:15:16.267]  And you know what?
[00:15:16.727 --> 00:15:19.428]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:32.452]   And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the Globalists, because I'm committed to a future For humanity.
[00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:34.133]  And I know you are as well.
[00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:42.397]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the InfoWar and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:51.522]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family and from the great crew at InfoWars, I want to thank you all because you are the InfoWar and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:53.463]  You have made history.
[00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.353]  We have made history together.
[00:15:55.373 --> 00:16:02.452]  Infowars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
