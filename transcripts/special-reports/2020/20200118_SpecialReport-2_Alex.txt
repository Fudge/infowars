[00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:03.183]  Are you saying, I mean, what, a hundred times smaller?
[00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:08.245]  At least a hundred times smaller than the original plan back in the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:09.744]  At least 100 times smaller.
[00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:21.984]  Don't get his face on camera.
[00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:22.975]  Are you rolling?
[00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:23.715]  Yeah, I'm rolling.
[00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:25.276]  Okay, well we got our police officer escort here.
[00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:28.957]  We're not going to show his face or anything, but we've got several nice police officers.
[00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:42.560]  So I was just saying, will you repeat to me your estimate of the original Women's Soros March, the day after Trump's inauguration in 2017, I guess that'd be January 21st, versus this one today.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.521]  And just please go ahead and tell them, sir.
[00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.862]  I'm looking right now from that time frame, from the inauguration to now.
[00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.171]   Are you saying, I mean, What, a hundred times smaller?
[00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.258]  At least a hundred times smaller than the original plan back in the inauguration for President Trump.
[00:00:56.498 --> 00:00:58.401]  At least a hundred times smaller at this point.
[00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.546]  Because that's what I saw was, I mean I was here, we flew out that night.
[00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:09.077]   It took us an hour and a half to get to the airport just because We were like 5-10 miles away and there was these huge hordes of pink hats everywhere.
[00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:13.082]  Every major street was just... And now, I'm like, oh is this a group meeting the march?
[00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:14.023]  People are like, no that's the march.
[00:01:14.263 --> 00:01:15.124]  I mean, that was tiny.
[00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:16.065]  It's very small.
[00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:18.547]  Very small compared to those numbers a few years ago.
[00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:20.850]  Here's Lee Stranahan, big syndicated talk show host.
[00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.071]  He's worked for Breitbart.
[00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:23.893]  He's worked for Huffington Post.
[00:01:23.973 --> 00:01:26.175]  A real centrist, I'd call you.
[00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:27.177]  Just a populist.
[00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.865]  He was here with us three years ago, three and a half years ago on the day of the inauguration.
[00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:33.046]  Every city, it was probably five million people.
[00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:35.607]  You couldn't drive five, six miles without seeing... No.
[00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:36.247]  They were everywhere.
[00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:37.627]  This is not even 1-100.
[00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:40.168]  No, not... Here's the thing.
[00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.829]  So I have an office about a block up the street from here.
[00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.670]  I now know this area well.
[00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.414]  In 2017, you could not walk on the streets.
[00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.216]  Everybody, there was no traffic on the streets.
[00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:52.718]  It was filled with people.
[00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.621]  I mean, when I say it's not 1-100th, I'm being polite about it.
[00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.964]  Yeah, I was saying maybe it's 1-20th, but when I got here, it's not even 1-100th.
[00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.206]  I mean, any side street looked like this.
[00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:11.490]  You literally could not walk anywhere for about six blocks, at all, because it was crowded with people.
[00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.830]  There was no traffic at all.
[00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.511]  When I say 1,100, I'm being polite about it.
[00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:17.032]  And think about this, Alex.
[00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:18.452]  This is what's so weird to me.
[00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:25.475]  In the middle of an impeachment, right when President Trump couldn't be impeached, you'd think they would get the biggest crowd ever.
[00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:31.957]  Isn't it interesting that in the middle of impeachment this is all Soros can muster at this point?
[00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:36.558]  I think that tells you the mood of the American people as opposed to the media perception.
[00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:37.959]  But they want us to believe.
[00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.539]  They want us to believe, I think, we're more divided than we are.
[00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.660]  And they want to believe that Soros controls America's women.
[00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.422]  And so, I mean, it's not working anymore.
[00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:52.223]  And so the whole illusion is beginning to implode.
[00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:55.144]  The entire illusion is beginning to dissolve.
