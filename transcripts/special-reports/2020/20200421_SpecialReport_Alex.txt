[00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:08.962]  Marina Abramovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted, Hollywood, D.C.
[00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:10.223]  or New York lowlife.
[00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:13.545]  They worship this creature.
[00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:20.650]  And they all talk about, oh my God, she's 70 years old, she looks so young because of the Aleister Crowley magic she does.
[00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.434]  And she goes on Reddit, Ask Me Anythings, and says, well, I do this as art, but when I do it, it's very, very serious.
[00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:41.154]  It's a ritual.
[00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:43.210]  Severed goat heads, people in...
[00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:54.664]  Vats of Blood, Wikileaks talking about supplying semen, milk, and blood to Tony Podesta at parties, and all of this.
[00:00:54.884 --> 00:01:05.471]  So, Microsoft is so tone deaf, they bring her out as their spokesperson, and oh, get our VR, you can see her appear like an apparition.
[00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:07.112]  It's clearly all ritualistic magic.
[00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:10.474]  So the internet had exploded last week about this.
[00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.075]  We came to the party way late.
[00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:14.297]  I'd love to take credit for it, but we don't get the credit.
[00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:40.524]   99% downvotes on YouTube, everyone hating it, going, this is the spirit cooking Aleister Crowley witch, goblin, worshipped by George Soros and his son, worshipped by others, and I just said, how pathetic and disgusting is this, and we put out our own little version of their Commercial augmented for what she really carries out in her rituals, not as what she put out in this PR piece.
[00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:51.187]  So now the New York Times has this whining, puling story going, this poor little cupcake, you know, that just does self-harm videos and things.
[00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.308]  They're abusing her, they're being mean to her.
[00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:56.788]  Sure, she's got kids in vats of blood.
[00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.509]  Sure, she's drinking blood.
[00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.189]  Sure, she worships Aleister Crowley.
[00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.770]  But it's all art.
[00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:14.341]  Kind of like Tony Podesta, one of her big fans, in the 2007 Washington Post spread about deviant art with paintings of little kids tied up in dungeons being abused.
[00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:16.022]  Oh, it's art though.
[00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:17.103]  It's so wonderful.
[00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:19.925]  This is ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:22.185]  The Internet rejected her.
[00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:24.366]  The Internet said, this is disgusting.
[00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:30.828]  We don't worship you like Jeffrey Epstein and Bill and Melinda Gates and Anthony Weiner and Uma Abedin and all the rest of them.
[00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:32.629]  And so they went, oh, what are we going to do?
[00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.890]  We've demonized Alex Jones for four or five years now.
[00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.211]  And so let's say he's behind.
[00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:45.861]  He's behind what no one likes, watching some bloated ugly cow in a red outfit float around a Microsoft ad.
[00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:46.722]  No, no.
[00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:47.482]  Here's the news flash.
[00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:49.003]  Everyone hates Bill Gates.
[00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:50.504]  Everyone hates you.
[00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:56.567]  Everyone hates Satanism and the New World Order, except all the weird freakazoids that are in your orbit.
[00:02:56.907 --> 00:03:00.989]  I mean, look at the video itself with the supposed weird trendies.
[00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.871]  That are being given their VR goggles that look like they've had lobotomies.
[00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:12.193]  This is the most uncool, seedy, gross example of weakness the planet's ever seen.
[00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:18.136]  And I'm so proud of humanity being forcibly injected by your poison, vomiting you up.
[00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.577]  So you all thought you were God.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:21.817]  You thought Satan was king.
[00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:24.118]  You thought Lucifer was this lord of the planet.
[00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:25.699]  You're only the tester.
[00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:30.460]  You're only the poison which makes us reject you and embrace God.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.501]  You're akin to used toilet paper.
[00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:41.800]   So in your ascendance and your Rothschild power and your Lucifer summoning his legions,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.479]  remember you're the losers and we're the winners.
[00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.719]   And you've prepared spiritually your own place with other people like
[00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.881]  you. And it has a name.
[00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:57.121]  And I think you know it.
[00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:02.121]  [inaudible]
[00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:15.960]  I believe that art of the future is art without objects.
[00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.011]  It's just pure transmission of energy between the viewer and the artist.
[00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:26.031]  To me, mixed reality is this answer.
[00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:36.031]   This was a unique opportunity to take the most legendary artists working now
[00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:41.031]  and capture them in such a way that they are translatable.
[00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:42.414]  Forever.
[00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:47.717]  If you're a collector, you're trying to find works that break new ground.
[00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.459]  We here at Christie's believe that this is that.
[00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:55.742]  And it will be the first time that a mixed reality artwork is sold at auction.
[00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:58.744]  There was always a question of what you buy when you buy a performance.
[00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:01.745]  You buy the video or you buy the addition of photographs.
[00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:05.988]  Here, you actually can have the artist's presence in your collection.
[00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:14.787]  The first thing that we had to figure out was you had to feel that you were in the room with Marina, not a document of Marina.
[00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:23.312]  HoloLens 2 was created by people who quite clearly have an interest in the audience forgetting that they are using technology.
[00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:29.072]  so the purest expression of artistic intent can happen.
[00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:54.072]  [Music]
[00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:58.072]   Once you die, the work will never die, because the work of art can continue.
[00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:02.590]  In performance, the piece is only in the memory of the audience and nowhere else.
[00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.690]  Here I am kept forever.
[00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.690]  [Music]
[00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.690]  Space Force Seven!
[00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:27.689]  [Music]
[00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.689]   DNA Force has been sold out for months, but now it's back in stock and 50% off.
[00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:42.366]  When it comes to boosting your body's natural defenses, DNA Force Plus is at the top of my list.
[00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:45.088]  The ingredients in this are incredible.
[00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:51.612]  PQQ, CoQ10, Astragalus Root, Reishi Mushroom, and so much more.
[00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:57.936]  Next up is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with up to 95% curcuminoids in it.
[00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:04.561]   This is a concentrated Extract with two other ingredients to supercharge it and deliver it into your body's cells.
[00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:12.706]  Don't have to tell you about turmeric and its history and the fact that the average turmeric out there is about three to five percent and it's still amazing.
[00:07:13.347 --> 00:07:18.250]  This is the strongest turmeric that we could find and develop and get into your hands.
[00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.832]  It's amazing and it funds the InfoWard.
[00:07:21.172 --> 00:07:24.293]  And it's 40% off right now at infowarestore.com.
[00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:31.676]  In the time we have, I can't get into all the amazing ingredients in Living Defense, but look into Black Walnut for yourself.
[00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.297]  You want to flush your body out?
[00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:34.638]  You want to energize?
[00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:37.619]  I'm telling you, listeners, go crazy with this.
[00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:39.339]  You've got to go read the reviews for yourself.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.240]  It's amazing.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.961]  Living Defense is also 40% off.
[00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.022]  Do I need to tell you about zinc and how important it is?
[00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:47.763]  Or the other vitamins and minerals?
[00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.402]  It's in the Real Red Pill.
[00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:51.903]  It's in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:55.084]  This is an absolute must-have.
[00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:57.505]  Not just in these crazy times, but all the time.
[00:07:57.805 --> 00:07:59.745]  Essential vitamins and minerals with pregnenolone.
[00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:00.686]  The Real Red Pill.
[00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:02.826]  And then there's triiodine.
[00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:05.127]  This is a basic building block.
[00:08:05.227 --> 00:08:05.947]  Do your research.
[00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:06.848]  Triiodine.
[00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:08.648]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:09.148 --> 00:08:09.608]  X3.
[00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:14.390]  Selling out, but I lowered the price to 60% because you and your family need this.
[00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.305]  And you can get all this and a lot more at huge discounts at InfoWarsTore.com.
