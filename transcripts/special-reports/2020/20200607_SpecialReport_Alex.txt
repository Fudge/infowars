[00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:05.011]  Every cult has the same goal, the utter submission of its members.
[00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.111]  Cult members surrender everything.
[00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:11.153]  They give up their physical freedom, where they can go, who they can see, how they can dress.
[00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.194]  But more than that, they give up control of their minds.
[00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:19.576]  Cult leaders determine what their followers are allowed to believe, even in their most private thoughts.
[00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:24.401]  In order to do this, cults separate people from all they have known before.
[00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.906]  They force their members to renounce their former lives, their countries, their customs.
[00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.749]  They allow no loyalty except to the cult.
[00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.973]  The first thing they attack, always, is the family.
[00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:38.537]  Families are the main impediment to brainwashing and extremism.
[00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:39.638]  That's true in every culture.
[00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399]   So if you're going to control individuals, if you're going to transform free people into
[00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.239]   compliant robots, the first thing you must do is separate them from the ones who love them most.
[00:00:50.239 --> 00:01:05.278]   Not just the United States of America, but the entire western world is being turned into a giant
[00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:08.478]  open air re-education camp.
[00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:09.807]  We are about to lay out.
[00:01:10.657 --> 00:01:30.852]  The incredibly authoritarian, tyrannical developments taking place now, where in the EU and the United States, we're being told to adopt the policies of the Communist Chinese when it comes to allowing those that espouse the establishment view to march and demonstrate and have free speech.
[00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:39.919]  But those that do not have the establishment view of the UN, the Communist Chinese and mainstream media are not allowed to have speech.
[00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.081]  Churches are not allowed to open.
[00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:46.765]  Synagogues are not allowed to open, according to the blue states and blue cities.
[00:01:47.285 --> 00:02:04.740]   But we're told by those very same governors and mayors that if you're marching and demonstrating against police brutality, not only is it protected, it's something everyone should do, but those that are actually demonstrating to reopen the economy and For all Americans to have our free speech and rights should be crushed.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.062]  This is openly being promoted by so-called mainstream media.
[00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:11.904]  And this is the next level of oppression.
[00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:13.185]  This is not a new world.
[00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:17.627]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:26.192]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:34.093]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:39.780]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.232]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:02:43.412 --> 00:02:46.134]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:02:46.734 --> 00:03:03.363]  When Rod Serling, himself, who fought in World War II against tyranny, wrote those words for the Obsolete Man episode in 1962, he gave newspaper interviews and said, I see this as a possible dystopic future, just like George Orwell saw a possible dystopic future.
[00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:13.074]   Well now, in the year 2020, we are seeing things that even surpass What our ancestors warned us about.
[00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:18.223]  And until we wake up to this and say no, it's only going to get worse.
[00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:20.467]  Obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:21.387]  A lie!
[00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.548]  No man is obsolete!
[00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:25.688]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:28.609]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:34.050]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.691]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:43.352]  I am a human being!
[00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:45.372]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:48.996]  Absolute.
[00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:51.957]  Absolute.
[00:03:52.077 --> 00:03:52.897]  I concur.
[00:03:53.177 --> 00:04:08.640]  Authoritarian regimes always do the same thing, over and over again, whether it was Mao, Stalin, Hitler, or Pol Pot, or thousands and thousands of years ago, during the corrupt Roman Empire, and emperors like Nero and Caligula.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.601]  They decide who is essential.
[00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:13.881]  They decide who is non-essential.
[00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.082]  They decide who is obsolete.
[00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:31.869]  And now, CNN and others are running breathlessly with headlines about how over a thousand health care professionals have come out and told the world that, hey, people protesting against the lockdown, they should be arrested.
[00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.214]  But everyone that's out there protesting against the police and calling for the police to be disbanded and abolished, well, they deserve their rights.
[00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:49.960]  So how is there going to be police to arrest all the people that go outside their homes and don't wear masks and who demonstrate for free speech?
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.123]  This, again, is a direct attack on common sense and knowledge.
[00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:57.244]  But this is what authoritarians always do.
[00:04:57.704 --> 00:05:05.889]  They always say that the inside group or the political group that supports the establishment has their speech, has their right to travel.
[00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:11.512]   But all of us that aren't, like the Jews in Nazi Germany, well, We're shit out of luck.
[00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:30.678]  When you see fictional movies like Red Dawn that came out in the 1980s where the Soviets and the Cubans take over part of the United States, and you see people in sports stadiums being told how much America sucks and being beaten into submission, you have to understand that that is taken from a model of what the Soviets did in Eastern Europe and what the Chinese did to their own people under communism.
[00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:45.205]   So now when you see America and Europe where people are being beat up for their race, where we're being told we're bad because we're white, we're being told America sucks, take a knee for the American flag, This is all classical demoralization to make you hate your nation.
[00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:51.645]   Just as Antifa, funded by Soros, says, "No borders, no walls, no USA at all."
[00:05:51.645 --> 00:05:59.645]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:05.645]   What we're witnessing is a multinational corporate takeover of once-free nations like the United States.
[00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:06.765]  It's that simple.
[00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:09.926]  And they're sowing the seeds of destruction openly to bring us down.
[00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:15.067]  Now listen to what mainstream media is magnifying as common sense and good.
[00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:17.817]  We always thought they were lying, now we know for sure.
[00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:23.242]  Because today we have an open letter signed by more than 1,200 doctors, professionals, and public health officials.
[00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:33.291]  And it explains that the riots you're watching must be allowed, while any other demonstration, like one you might participate in, must be suppressed.
[00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:40.637]  Quote, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.
[00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:41.097]  Huh?
[00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:49.645]  But they clarified, this should not be confused with permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-at-home orders.
[00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:59.513]  Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but they are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for black lives.
[00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:12.539]  Again, this is being pushed by the entire corporate media around the world that this group of brave doctors stepped forward and said, people out demonstrating against police brutality are not a COVID-19 danger.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.861]  Hey, I say they have the right to protest and I think they should peacefully.
[00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:19.763]  But they're saying this doesn't cause a health problem magically.
[00:07:20.203 --> 00:07:26.546]  Again, that's suspending reality if you buy their earlier lie that COVID-19 is super deadly.
[00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:31.911]   Cults always try to get their members To suspend logic and reason.
[00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:34.153]  If you're part of the leftist uprising, you're wonderful.
[00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:42.502]  But if you don't want to be locked in your house, well then you should not be allowed to go out and protest if you believe in free speech for all.
[00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:44.404]  This is the authoritarian saying.
[00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:49.890]  If you join us and take up our policies of the overthrow of capitalism in America, you have your rights.
[00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.551]  If you don't go out and parrot what we say, you must be silenced.
[00:07:53.911 --> 00:08:02.634]  That's why synagogues in New York and in New Jersey are now putting up signs saying, we support George Floyd, we're an anti-police demonstration.
[00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:09.716]  So now the governors and mayors can't touch them because they've already said, if you go out and try to overthrow the government, you're a good guy.
[00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:15.298]  This is the essence of a suspension of common sense and true mass mind control.
[00:08:15.738 --> 00:08:22.100]  We were told the police were the best people on earth when they were arresting people for walking their dog or going to the beach.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.381]  And we saw mayors all over the United States from L.A.
[00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:30.862]  to Chicago saying, tattle on your neighbors and get money because snitches are good.
[00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:32.723]  You know the old expression about snitches?
[00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:36.364]  Well, in this case, snitches get rewards.
[00:08:36.904 --> 00:08:40.427]  And you better not ever leave your house or we will arrest you!
[00:08:40.628 --> 00:08:48.355]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:54.000]  Oh, but then those very mayors go out and march, and governors in Michigan go out and march.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.441]  I'm the public face of this city.
[00:08:56.801 --> 00:09:00.502]  I'm on national media, and I'm out in the public eye.
[00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:06.263]  And, you know, I'm a person who, I take my personal hygiene very seriously.
[00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:10.224]  As I said, I felt like I needed to have a haircut.
[00:09:10.664 --> 00:09:13.645]  I'm not able to do that myself, and so I got a haircut.
[00:09:15.384 --> 00:09:29.715]  The same governors in New York, California, Michigan and Pennsylvania that ordered nursing homes to take pneumonia and flu patients into them then calling those deaths COVID-19 deaths and jacking up the numbers more than 50,000.
[00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:32.678]  But the fraud gets even deeper.
[00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:42.529]  From day one it was Fauci and the NIH and Melinda Gates that were funding the Wuhan lab in bat coronaviruses that could jump into humans.
[00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:43.570]  That's now been admitted.
[00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:51.339]  So the very group that was funding where this supposed virus escaped are now the people in charge that tell us how to run our lives.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.709]  And then it was Bill Gates testing kits that created millions of false positives and his facilities were shut down by the FDA.
[00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:06.558]  Now the FDA has been shutting down some of his vaccine experimentation that skipped animal trials because people have been getting so incredibly sick.
[00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:17.746]  But remember, it was Bill Gates that funded in the UK and the US the fake models that showed 2.2 to 2.5 million dead Americans when it's only been 100,000.
[00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:25.131]  And again, they're using people that died of the flu, of gunshot wounds, of pneumonia in the COVID column.
[00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:29.836]  So even with all that fraud, it's only at a hundred and something thousand.
[00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:34.722]  That is 20 times lower than the models put out by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:36.624]  But Bill and Melinda Gates went further.
[00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:44.493]  They funded a study saying hydroxychloroquine that puts zinc into the cells and blocks COVID-19 and all other major viruses, by the way.
[00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:47.155]  And let's not forget the really big issue.
[00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:49.416]  I mentioned it earlier, but it's on record.
[00:10:49.236 --> 00:10:54.836]   saying all of it was a fraud and a lie and all other studies show hydroxychloroquine
[00:10:54.836 --> 00:11:01.476]   is incredible with almost a 100% cure rate. And let's not forget the really big issue.
[00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:08.156]   I mentioned it earlier but it's on record. Doctors in California, New York, Michigan,
[00:11:08.156 --> 00:11:15.956]   and Pennsylvania, the four blue states, that ordered healthy COVID patients who had the virus
[00:11:15.956 --> 00:11:20.115]  or other pneumonias or other flus into the nursing home.
[00:11:20.867 --> 00:11:28.534]  Doctors told them the default position is you don't put sick patients in nursing homes because there'll be a high death rate from even a normal cold.
[00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:30.596]  But they needed the high death rate.
[00:11:31.076 --> 00:11:36.682]  That's why the NIH that's actually controlled by Bill Gates under Trump's nose made those orders.
[00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:57.697]  Red states refused saying that's insane, but four blue states took the UN directive from the WHO through Fauci and engaged in the super crime of putting sick patients and healthy patients that had the viruses into the nursing homes, now accounting for more than half the deaths in the United States.
[00:11:58.037 --> 00:12:01.440]  Governor Whitmer didn't just send all those COVID patients to the nursing homes.
[00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:09.041]  She also is still telling folks they can't open their businesses or leave their homes, hoping to kill the economy to drive Trump from office.
[00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:09.901]  That's her admitted goal.
[00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:20.290]  But she's out marching in public again with Black Lives Matter, even though COVID-19 has higher death rates in black Americans, if you believe the official numbers.
[00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:27.937]  And it's the same thing for the Minneapolis mayor, who told the police to stand down, let everybody burn down the city.
[00:12:28.317 --> 00:12:43.606]   Now he wants the federal government to And now the Davos Group, that is openly promoting world government, has come out and announced the Great Reset.
[00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:52.091]  And they openly say that COVID-19 is wonderful because it's going to shut down the world economy and cut our carbon and save the planet.
[00:12:52.776 --> 00:12:54.658]  But it's not COVID-19 that did that.
[00:12:55.118 --> 00:13:04.366]  It's the hoax of COVID-19 being used by the globalists to selectively shut down companies and industries and small businesses they don't control.
[00:13:05.007 --> 00:13:15.755]   It allows them to come in and engage in economic warfare and siege And so it's up to all of us to decide whether we'll be free men and women or whether we're going to be slaves.
[00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.316]  The ball is in your court.
