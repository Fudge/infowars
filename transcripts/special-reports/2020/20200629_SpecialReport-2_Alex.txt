[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  [Applause]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Hollywood, the Democratic Party, the unelected EU bureaucracy,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and the Fortune 100 corporations are almost unanimously rooting against America,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   against the American people, and against our President Donald Trump.
[00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:55.114]  They're all over the news saying the American century's over, and the Chinese dragon is taking over, and that America's quarantined, and that COVID-19 was our fault, and that the United States may not even exist in the future, and certainly isn't going to be a superpower.
[00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:59.858]  This is what the Democrats are openly saying, like Joe Biden.
[00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:08.103]  He puts out bizarre lies, like 120 million have died from COVID-19, and the media doesn't even challenge him on it.
[00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:15.709]  What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now everything is complicated.
[00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.660]   Not only is the health care piece, but People don't have a job.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.382]  People don't have anywhere to go.
[00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:22.763]  They don't know what they're going to do.
[00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.366]  And a lot of people you have unnecessarily.
[00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:29.468]  Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.
[00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:33.011]  Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.
[00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.674]  They are rooting against this country.
[00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:37.135]  And I've got to be honest with you.
[00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:55.711]   If they are successful removing President Trump one way or another with this election in 125 days, They have already said they're going to have a scorched earth policy against nationalists, against conservatives, against Christians and others, and that they're going to use racial division
[00:01:56.348 --> 00:02:07.081]  to destabilize the country further and collapse it into a deep depression and bring in the United Nations to actually manage the country after a controlled civil war.
[00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:17.354]   Now I know this sounds outrageous but the globalists have been pushing for this for decades and are now openly saying they want revolution that's Based on a race war.
[00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:21.640]  What you're watching is class war disguised as race war.
[00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:29.092]  Keep the population at one another's throats, angry, suspicious, tribal, and maybe they'll never figure out how much we're stealing.
[00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:35.053]  The biggest change to American society over the past 50 years has been the death of the middle class.
[00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:37.254]  This used to be a middle-class country.
[00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:38.494]  It is not anymore.
[00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:46.316]  Most of our population has become poorer in real terms, while a shrinking number of people control an ever-expanding percentage of our wealth.
[00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:52.718]  That means that fewer Americans overall have a meaningful stake in the society, and more are dependent.
[00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:56.459]  That makes the country much more volatile than it once was.
[00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.100]  These riots really shouldn't surprise you.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:12.029]  If we underestimate how dangerous this is, and if we don't expose how powerful global forces are playing us off against each other, they have a good chance of actually succeeding.
[00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:17.913]  They haven't spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few decades building this up for no reason.
[00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:20.575]  They also admit that a collapsed U.S.
[00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.639]  will, quote, cut the global carbon footprint of the planet and save the Earth.
[00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.521]  So they're saying a global depression will save the Earth.
[00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.014]  They know that man-made global warming isn't real.
[00:03:31.634 --> 00:03:33.995]  They know that carbon dioxide is a trace gas.
[00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:45.379]  They're doing this because once there's a worldwide depression, the big mega-banks can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar and get the population of the world into even greater debt.
[00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.841]  You've seen the disruption in some of the most sophisticated supply chain countries in the world, like the United States.
[00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:57.323]  And you can imagine, if you have a problem there, what you're going to have in the most fragile environment are economies in the world, like in Africa.
[00:03:57.853 --> 00:04:07.558]  And so we had just come out incidentally or coincidentally with a report of last year's severe food shortage or the severe food insecurity for people.
[00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:15.262]  135 million people literally marching toward the brink of starvation and now compound that with COVID.
[00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:25.548]  We're looking at the possibility of 265 million people marching toward the brink of starvation and this will be an absolute catastrophe.
[00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.786]  The New World Order has suppressed and enslaved the third world.
[00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:35.390]  And their COVID-19 lockdown, not the virus, is already starving millions to death right now.
[00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.914]  They admit that they are engineering this planetary collapse to bring in a tyrannical one-world government.
[00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:50.699]  And all that stands in its way is the Christian idea of basic freedom that the West has promoted and stood for.
[00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.280]  The West is corrupt, we have a lot of problems, and we've sinned as well.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.001]  But, compared to the New World Order, we are night and day.
[00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:06.884]  That's why they've got to have the idea of America, and the idea that Martin Luther King promoted, about us all coming together for what we stand for, not what color we are, destroyed.
[00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:14.446]  Because the New World Order wants to use our differences, like the Tower of Babel worldwide, to control us, not enlighten us, not empower us.
[00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:15.927]  They don't want real diversity.
[00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:26.432]  They want global corporate control over every action of our lives with a planetary AI big tech social score monitoring, surveilling and controlling our every move.
[00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:33.256]  We have to be politically more engaged than we've ever been before to stop this new allure takeover.
[00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:38.630]  But we also have to understand that we have to reach out to God and pray and ask for God's intervention.
[00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.033]  And we also have to be physically prepared for what's happening.
[00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.637]  If you don't have a firearm and don't know how to use it, don't have ammo, you really should get some.
[00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:49.701]  And you really should get high quality storable foods and water filtration systems.
[00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.915]  And in those two departments, water filtration and storable food, we have the highest quality at the best price you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:58.418]  I would suggest now you get your storable food today.
[00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:00.460]  It only takes about four weeks to ship it out to you.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.324]  So many others are sold out, but InfoWareStore.com has it and is ready to ship it to you.
[00:06:05.342 --> 00:06:16.430]  The New World Order social engineers are all on record that their entire program is about domesticating us, dumbing us down, and making it to where we are not self-sufficient.
[00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:27.097]  During the Great Depression in the 1920s, it's estimated by major universities that around 7 million Americans starved to death from malnutrition or died from diseases because their immune systems were run down.
[00:06:28.018 --> 00:06:32.104]  Now, back then we were 90% rural, and almost everybody was self-sufficient.
[00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:40.116]  Now we're 90% urban, and of the 10% that are rural, it's estimated that less than half of those are actually self-sufficient.
[00:06:41.226 --> 00:06:43.889]  We are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.711]  We have been domesticated.
[00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:51.258]  I know how to skin a buck and run a trot line, but I don't know one one-hundredth of what my grandfather knew.
[00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:53.781]  I don't know one twentieth of what my dad knew.
[00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:56.124]  And quite frankly, I've dropped the ball.
[00:06:56.304 --> 00:06:57.585]  My children are city slickers.
[00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:00.728]  They know how to shoot a gun, change a tire, that's about it.
[00:07:01.348 --> 00:07:05.952]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[00:07:06.232 --> 00:07:14.759]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse, and water filtration, and food to last you at least a few months.
[00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.681]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:20.264]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:22.986]  They have wide selections, special diets, you name it.
[00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:26.109]  It's the best price you're going to find for quality food like this.
[00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.352]  And most importantly, all the other big companies have become fly-by-night.
[00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.254]  They only keep a little bit of food on hand.
[00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:34.396]  And it's low quality, it's overpriced, if they even have it.
[00:07:34.736 --> 00:07:36.838]  And they'll lie to you and say, oh, we ship in two weeks.
[00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:37.258]  They're not.
[00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.140]  They're still shipping in six to eight weeks if you can find it.
[00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:51.987]   But, our sponsor, that we've been partnered with for 11 years, MyPatria, has the food, has four plants in the United States, several sub-plants, And a lot of their food shipped out within two weeks, but on average, it's about four.
[00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:56.068]  But you need to get the orders in now, in the lull before the storm.
[00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:58.029]  I told you lockdown two was coming.
[00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:01.070]  I told you they're going to have new versions of the virus.
[00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.151]  The New World Order is making its move.
[00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:10.193]  Whether Trump loses or wins, things are just going to get more crazy, and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:22.500]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future, and the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.803]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
[00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:31.665]  Get ready, get prepared, spread the word.
[00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:38.128]  Whatever you do, pray to God and get yourself right with God because this is the real deal and things will only get crazier from here on out.
[00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:39.569]  Good luck and God bless.
