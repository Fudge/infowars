[00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:03.079]  But hydroxychloroquine.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.361]  Try it.
[00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:06.702]  If you'd like.
[00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:25.754]  There are thousands of points you should know, but one you should look into is a 2005 NIH-sponsored study run by Fauci that found that in primates, hydroxychloroquine was almost 100% effective in monkeys and other primates to treat the SARS corona family of viruses.
[00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:31.461]  But now he won't stand up for the president because he's bought and paid for by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.563]  This is a crime against humanity.
[00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:38.830]  This is doctors bought off, ignoring the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm.
[00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.155]  You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises.
[00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:51.498]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:52.779]  You know, I can assure you.
[00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:04.710]  You are about to see the most devastating information ever to the big pharma cartels, to the deep state, to the leftists that are dug in like ticks at the CIA.
[00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.733]  They have really jumped the shark.
[00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:10.814]  They've bitten off way more than they can chew.
[00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:16.677]  Coming out in the Washington Post and Vanity Fair and everywhere and saying, Trump is insane.
[00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:18.578]  He's not a doctor.
[00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:26.263]  How can he tell you that hydroxychloroquine is a well-known safe treatment for COVID-19?
[00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:39.517]  Trump in the press conference said the White House physician said it's a good idea with zinc and of course with Z-Pak to kill the bacteria that can carry the virus into the lungs.
[00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:44.141]  The zithromycin and zinc, they say zinc.
[00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:45.782]  You should add zinc.
[00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:51.425]  Now, it all has to be recommended by doctors, physicians, but they say zinc.
[00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.566]  I want to throw that out there.
[00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:58.150]  You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it.
[00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.128]  The front line workers, many, many are taking it.
[00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:03.930]  I happen to be taking it.
[00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:05.593]  I happen to be taking it.
[00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:12.142]  But the media ignores that Trump is doing this under the White House doctor's direction and says Trump just pulled this out of his ass.
[00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:28.159]   So we're about to show you Just a few of the hundreds of major medical clinic and hospital owners and top scientists and researchers and other medical doctors, in some cases that have treated thousands of patients, others hundreds and hundreds.
[00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.821]  And it's been on ABC News locally.
[00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:36.064]  It's been in local newspapers, but it's never on the national news.
[00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:54.117]   Because Big Pharma wants you to think only a vaccine And then therapeutics like this Remdesivir that in many studies actually makes people worse but in a Fauci-sponsored study made 8% of people live four days longer.
[00:02:54.137 --> 00:03:03.045]  It's a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing the Gilead drug Remdesivir with a placebo.
[00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:08.924]   And although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint,
[00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:15.805]   they were modest. The improvement was 31% better chance of recovering and getting out of the hospital.
[00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:18.924]  You talk about a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:19.748]  This is incredible.
[00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:39.478]  Meanwhile, there are studies in Canada, studies in Australia, studies in places like France that show that hydroxychloroquine with zinc is incredibly successful in almost every case, unless the person already is 85 years old and has cancer, has serious liver failure, kidney failure, then it doesn't work.
[00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.761]  There's only been one study that shows hydroxychloroquine doesn't work amazing.
[00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:49.845]  That was not a VA study.
[00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:56.049]  Researchers took VA numbers and they did not clinically review them.
[00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.270]  They were not peer-reviewed.
[00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:06.697]  They did not even look at what the President just mentioned, the various comorbidities that the patients who were referenced in that study had.
[00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:11.620]  The Department of Defense and VA have been using it for 65 years.
[00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:21.770]  So they've known this the whole time.
[00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.518]  So ask yourself, why are they suppressing all these scientists and medical doctors and others that are having miraculous results with this?
[00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:31.480]  Because they want you in fear.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:40.466]  And they don't want you to know that it is basic vitamin and mineral deficiencies on record that allow you to become compromised and die.
[00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:49.451]  When you hear that zinc and vitamin D3 and iodine and vitamin C are essential, that's like oxygen being essential.
[00:04:50.052 --> 00:04:52.133]  That's like water being essential.
[00:04:52.453 --> 00:05:09.947]   But this is the power grab and your compliance wearing the stupid noodles on your heads or eating in Europe in these bubbles or wearing these weird Inertubes, when you go to bars, is like the Milgram or Stanford experiments in learned helplessness and Stockholm Syndrome to see how much you'll put up with.
[00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:25.740]  But this is really dividing the wheat from the chaff, the slaves from the free humans, because anyone buying into this is literally ignoring facts, ignoring science, and the left's belief that this would drive Trump from office isn't going to work.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.163]  All it's done is imploded all of your blue cities even further.
[00:05:30.253 --> 00:05:31.754]  That's what they say about mentally ill scum.
[00:05:32.334 --> 00:05:33.554]  They love to destroy themselves.
[00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:35.675]  They love to be self-destructive.
[00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.516]  But here at Infowars, we're not self-destructive.
[00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:38.856]  We are constructive.
[00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:40.437]  And we believed in America.
[00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:45.318]  And we bet on you that when you heard the truth, no matter how horrible it was, you'd wake up and take action.
[00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:46.019]  And you did.
[00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.559]  And now, we've got the initiative.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.721]  We are the real change agents in a pro-human future.
[00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:53.101]  And we are winning.
[00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:54.642]  So take action.
[00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:55.582]  Let's take it to the next level.
[00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:58.383]  Because the war and the fight for the future is now.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.802]  What we're finding clinically with our patients is that it really only works in conjunction with zinc.
[00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:10.604]  So the hydroxychloroquine opens a zinc channel, zinc goes into the cell, it then blocks the replication of the cellular machinery.
[00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:12.665]  So it has to be used in conjunction with zinc.
[00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:15.526]  We are seeing some clinical responses in that regard.
[00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:21.989]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill and within 8 to 12 hours they were basically symptom free.
[00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:28.051]  That means in my case, whenever I've used it, I've used it on 16 other patients and it has worked.
[00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:32.713]  Because we don't have any real medicine to treat the COVID virus infection.
[00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:37.855]  And I thank God that the President of the United States mentioned that drug because it did save me.
[00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:40.196]  That drug is hydroxychloroquine.
[00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:51.700]  What I did was I combined the two approaches and I made a three drug regimen combining zinc with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
[00:06:52.345 --> 00:07:02.513]  I actually treated only around 200 of them, because the rest were low risk and, in my opinion, were going to get better without any treatment.
[00:07:03.193 --> 00:07:08.958]  Of the overall group, six patients ended up in the hospital, unfortunately.
[00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:15.237]  Four of them are receiving IV antibiotics for pneumonia.
[00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:19.197]  And two of them are intubated or on a respirator.
[00:07:19.197 --> 00:07:23.237]   They developed this ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
[00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:25.156]  And no one has died, thank God.
[00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:29.358]   Then China also had some follow-up studies where they looked at the effects in people
[00:07:29.358 --> 00:07:31.437]  and it looked very effective in people.
[00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:37.061]  In France, we've talked about a study in France which was pretty small but showed that it was effective.
[00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.327]  Now, as you said, doctors have been using it all over the United States.
[00:07:41.687 --> 00:07:43.988]  Many are saying that it's working.
[00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:50.331]  We've seen it in New York State, giving it to hundreds of people right now in hospitals with a lot of promising signs.
[00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:59.316]  And finally, the University of Pennsylvania has just begun a major double-blinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial.
[00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:00.616]  And you know when they do that?
[00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.077]  When they spend that kind of money?
[00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:03.958]  When they believe a treatment may work.
[00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:10.683]  ...today providing this testimonial from a COVID-19 patient who was treated with the drug hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:13.705]  You guys saved my life, and you know you did.
[00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:37.131]  In China, the Chloroquine is also noted to decrease the severity of the symptoms and get patients discharged early to home and they're actually giving to a lot of patients it could be mild, moderate or severe cases and they're actually using 500 milligrams twice a day and actually South Korea actually used it once a day instead of the 500 milligrams twice a day that China has been using.
[00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:39.730]  My name is Yvette Lozano.
[00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.293]  I practice medicine in Dallas, Texas and have been doing so for the last 20 years.
[00:08:44.313 --> 00:08:48.556]  Within 24 hours the patient was completely symptom free.
[00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:51.418]  And here's the take home message for all of you.
[00:08:51.818 --> 00:08:53.920]  It's called hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.801]  Hydroxychloroquine!
[00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.362]  It costs $13.
[00:08:58.542 --> 00:08:59.342]  Right!
[00:08:59.502 --> 00:08:59.342]  $13.
[00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:01.822]  It's been on the market for 60 years.
[00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:05.503]  It's been prescribed hundreds of millions of times for malaria.
[00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:10.944]  I personally have prescribed it hundreds of times for malaria, hundreds of times for rheumatic diseases.
[00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:13.885]  I've never seen one adverse side effect.
[00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:15.586]  I can't say that of Tylenol.
[00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:17.206]  I can't say that of aspirin.
[00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:20.348]  Doctors can prescribe it prophylactically.
[00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:21.909]  I know many doctors are doing it.
[00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:27.974]  I know many doctors that are taking it themselves because there's some evidence that it might be prophylactic and it is so safe.
[00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:35.139]  Tucker, I want to tell you about a 96-year-old man in Florida who said one night, I don't think I'm going to make it.
[00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.200]  I feel very weak.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.261]  The end is coming.
[00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:38.241]  I'm coughing.
[00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:38.982]  I'm short of breath.
[00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:40.383]  I can't get up from the couch.
[00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:45.572]  The next day, he was on hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics per his cardiologist.
[00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:47.836]  He got up the next day, he was fine.
[00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:49.596]  This man is my father.
[00:09:49.596 --> 00:09:53.197]  [Explosion]
[00:09:53.197 --> 00:09:57.896]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.745]  And I told folks, going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:06.528]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:14.014]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:15.556]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:18.518]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:23.649]   But with the election fraud and the the Covid-19, all the wars, and the third world collapse,
[00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:27.659]   and everything else that's going on. Now is the time to get storable foods because
[00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:32.259]   they'll last for 25 years, they're in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's
[00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:36.259]   good to have that box checked off to be ready. And it funds the InfoWars. So we have storable
[00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:37.820]  food available again.

[00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:45.399]   Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on
[00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:50.340]   them. They do not want you to be self-sufficient. Get your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.739]   right now while you still can.
[00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:55.731]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:00.732]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:03.253 --> 00:11:04.293]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:07.974]  It is called hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:08.054 --> 00:11:09.594]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:12.815]  Try it.
[00:11:13.743 --> 00:11:15.685]  Yes, try it if you like it.
[00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:20.308]  And if you're worried about the side effects, just remember, Donald Trump is a doctor.
[00:11:20.588 --> 00:11:21.469]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:22.650]  Okay, my mistake.
[00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.793]  How do you calibrate being enthusiastic and not playing doctor?
[00:11:27.213 --> 00:11:28.835]  Because I want people to live.
[00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:30.896]  And I'm seeing people dying.
[00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:35.279]  And I've seen people that are going to die without it.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.400]  What?
[00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:38.662]  We got the treatment.
[00:11:38.962 --> 00:11:40.463]  We're gonna cure it.
[00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:42.565]  We're gonna... What?
[00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.482]  He was just making that stuff.
[00:11:46.063 --> 00:11:47.204]  I feel good about it.
[00:11:47.304 --> 00:11:55.733]  Turns out, actual doctors do not suggest taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 because there is no evidence yet to suggest it protects against the virus.
[00:11:55.813 --> 00:11:57.915]  I don't think we can definitively say it works.
[00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:07.385]  Not only was Fauci mocking President Trump for talking about it, but you had Governor Whitmer in Michigan threatening physicians, I'll take your license if you prescribe hydroxychloroquine.
[00:12:08.658 --> 00:12:12.379]  And telling pharmacists, don't fill any prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine.
[00:12:12.579 --> 00:12:21.261]  And while many on the left are using the coronavirus outbreak to attack President Trump, one Democrat state lawmaker is crediting him with saving her life.
[00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:27.362]  If President Trump had not talked about this, it would not be something that's accessible for anyone to be able to get at right now.
[00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:34.124]  Because I did have a difficult time even that day obtaining the medication because of an order that was put down in my state.
[00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:35.264]  It saved my life.
[00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:41.768]  I want to tell you about a 96-year-old man in Florida who said one night, I don't think I'm going to make it.
[00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:42.829]  I feel very weak.
[00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:43.830]  The end is coming.
[00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.850]  I'm coughing.
[00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.591]  I'm short of breath.
[00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:46.972]  I can't get up from the couch.
[00:12:47.452 --> 00:12:52.195]  The next day, he was on hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics per his cardiologist.
[00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:53.636]  He got up the next day.
[00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:54.397]  He was fine.
[00:12:54.777 --> 00:12:56.098]  This man is my father.
[00:12:56.378 --> 00:12:58.059]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:09.787]   Why is any network running these press conferences where he keeps talking about An unproven drug that might work for malaria, might work for lupus, doesn't work for this.
[00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:12.489]  A lot of people would say, follow the money.
[00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:21.014]  There's got to be some sort of financial tie to someone somewhere that has the president pushing this repeatedly.
[00:13:21.094 --> 00:13:24.957]  Turns out he has a financial stake in the company that makes the drug.
[00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:26.558]  Of course he does.
[00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:28.400]  The press, honestly, is out of control.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.381]  The level of dishonesty is out of control.
[00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:32.864]  If Trump is for it, they're against it.
[00:13:33.304 --> 00:13:35.706]  Even if it might save American lives.
[00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:36.988]  What reactive children they are.
[00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:37.868]  He's gotta stop.
[00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:40.491]  He's not, he's not, we don't want a drug pusher for president.
[00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:47.658]  Gene Robinson, you write in the Washington Post, the one word that proves why President Trump should not be president, what is it?
[00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:49.728]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:13:49.848 --> 00:13:51.049]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:57.973]  Experts say there isn't enough clinical data to show it's effective for coronavirus, and it has some serious side effects.
[00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:03.636]  The terrible publicity this drug has received just relentlessly over the past three weeks.
[00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:05.657]  This is a crackpot cure.
[00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.038]  This is snake oil.
[00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:08.459]  We've got the treatment.
[00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:10.240]  We're gonna cure it.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.962]  Do you think that has made physicians hesitant to try it as a therapy?
[00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.245]  No, I think physicians go with what works.
[00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:21.088]  Anecdotal evidence straight from the patient's mouths are attesting to its success.
[00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:23.110]  And here's what I consider to be the secret weapon.
[00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:25.672]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:28.034]  I don't think we can definitively say it works.
[00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:31.617]  Well, add my name to those personal accounts because I am feeling better.
[00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.138]  You guys saved my life.
[00:14:33.158 --> 00:14:34.640]  I will value that.
[00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.894]  If I could cover my face with my hands, I would.
[00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:43.338]  You're prescribing it, and it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[00:14:43.438 --> 00:14:49.607]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill, and within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free.
[00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:53.091]  And so, clinically, I am seeing a resolution.
