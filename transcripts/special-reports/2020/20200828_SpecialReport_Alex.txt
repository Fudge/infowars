[00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:06.372]  Alex Jones here on this Friday night with some incredibly positive and good news.
[00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:26.746]  General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the head of the Pentagon, the most senior military officer in the United States, issued a public letter we now learn about five days ago to Congress saying the military will not take part in a military coup removing President Trump if there is a contested election.
[00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:28.888]  Now why is this so important?
[00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:30.229]  It's unprecedented.
[00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:40.170]   Atlantic Monthly and other globalist publications a year ago started talking about Canvassing top military officers about removing Trump in a military coup.
[00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.131]  Now, why would they say that publicly?
[00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:55.274]  Because they're normalizing it and testing the waters so people think that that's something that's okay to do when it's absolutely criminal and called high treason against the election of Donald Trump or any other duly elected president.
[00:00:55.974 --> 00:01:01.576]  Then we saw Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Eric Holder, the former Attorney General, and Joe Biden.
[00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.649]  All of them talk about, we will escort him from the White House.
[00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.809]  And I'm very proud of Infowars.
[00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.090]  We were the first to point this out over a year ago.
[00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.671]  We were the first to beat the drum, make a big issue about it.
[00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:19.753]  A few months ago, Milley was kind of making cryptic comments about Trump and how he shouldn't be seen with him in public, marching over to the church that was burned.
[00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.694]  And other top generals were making anti-Trump statements.
[00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:26.795]  And we saw that as a nod to the deep state against the president.
[00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:30.394]   And so did high-level CIA contacts and others that we have.
[00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:31.074]  They agreed.
[00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:34.335]   But now, because it's clear that Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:37.115]  Now that the riots, the deep state of engineering have backfired.
[00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:40.474]   Now that attempts by Soros to plunge the dollar have failed so far.
[00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:45.114]   65 days out from the election, things are really solidifying behind Trump.
[00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:48.795]   I told you Trump was going to win before anybody else did five, six years ago.
[00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:51.115]  Right before he, you know, he even announced that.
[00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:51.988]  I said, it'll probably be Trump.
[00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.109]  It'll probably be the leader.
[00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.530]  And about a year after the election, I said he was going to happen.
[00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.491]  Populism, because globalism is in trouble all over the world.
[00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.432]  So we're not out of the woods yet.
[00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:05.574]  They're putting out 80 million ballots mailed randomly around to gum up the system.
[00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:07.635]  To contest the election.
[00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:20.128]  But they were, again, asking the military brass, canvassing them, will you go along with us if we start having states secede and if we start calling for Trump to be removed, will you take him out?
[00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:28.657]  Even the New York Times a month ago had an article about John Podesta, Tony Podesta's brother, the former head of the Clinton campaign.
[00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:41.552]  Saying we're going to have states pull out, say that Trump lost, say that Biden won, have our own inauguration, and we'll hold the stock market and the dollar hostage, and we believe the military will step in and take Trump out.
[00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:44.193]  That was in the New York Times a month ago.
[00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:45.934]  Breitbart also reported on it.
[00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:51.416]  So they've been normalizing all of this and it's failed, and now the chairman of the Joint Chiefs has come out.
[00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:58.441]  In a statement military-wide and to Congress saying that's not our role, it's unconstitutional, we will not do it.
[00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:08.568]  He responded last week when two senior Democrats on the Armed Services Committee in the House sent him a letter saying help us do this.
[00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:17.735]  So that's how far along they were normalizing this with Pelosi and Hillary and all the rest of them saying we're going to contest no matter what happens because they know they're losing.
[00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:23.747]   And we're going to say it's illegitimate and we're going to have states break away and causing a civil war and they're trying to see if the
[00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:29.296]   modern, I guess, Robert E. Lee is going to be the leader of the Northern Army or whatever.
[00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:33.717]   But it's the Democrats, again, that are trying to break the country up.
[00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:35.776]  This is history repeating itself.
[00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.997]  It is insane.
[00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.997]  But this is incredibly good news.
[00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:41.569]  Now, a lot of you have already seen these clips.
[00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.230]  We've been beating this Trump hard for over a year.
[00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:51.374]  But we're going to play some of these clips of Biden, of Pelosi, of Hillary Clinton just last week saying, we're going to contest no matter what.
[00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:52.614]  And they're still going to try this.
[00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:54.335]  They've got other tricks up their sleeves.
[00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:59.538]  But they thought Trump and America would get blamed for the race riots they engineered.
[00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:04.140]  They thought that the bad economy and the COVID hoax would get blamed on Trump.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.661]  People are seeing through it.
[00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.480]  So, we've got an early watch now.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.620]  What's the deep state going to pull?
[00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:21.225]  So again, this is a time to be very, very pleased, very, very thankful to God, but to redouble our efforts to make sure this big win happens, keep Bolsonaro in in Brazil, keep Patriots in in the UK, and expand 1776 worldwide.
[00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:24.967]  But the military refused to be part of the coup.
[00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:26.368]  CNN tried to spin it.
[00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:27.268]  Top U.S.
[00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:30.450]  general tells Congress the military won't play a role in the 2020 election.
[00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.773]  But it's all in the article, his letter, everything, admitting that they asked him, will you be part of removing Trump physically?
[00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.595]  And they said, not just no, hell no, it's illegal.
[00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:42.136]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:43.417]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:45.058]  Thank you so much for your support, Patriots.
[00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:52.065]  Without you, this broadcast would not be here, and this broadcast always covers the hard subjects first when others won't talk about it.
[00:04:52.285 --> 00:04:58.170]  It sounded crazy 14 months ago to say they're planning a military coup, they're canvassing the military, but they were doing it!
[00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:08.441]  We had to put it out there, warn people, watch folks get aware of it, and then the Democrats came and tried to push the plan, and people went, whoa, this is all true, we've got to fight it.
[00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.204]  So, you've got to get out ahead of this stuff or they're going to win.
[00:05:11.504 --> 00:05:12.685]  And more and more you're out ahead of it.
[00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:13.907]  So supporting Bandot Video.
[00:05:14.227 --> 00:05:16.889]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com has changed the world.
[00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.491]  You guys are really, really amazing.
[00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:20.272]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:23.995]  And spread the word about our new nighttime show that a lot of you are watching right now.
[00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:25.577]  7 to 9 p.m.
[00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.999]  Election Countdown, Taking Back America.
[00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.702]  And tonight it is Harrison Smith and others hosting Donald Reign.
[00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:33.883]  We'll be back next week along with Owen Shorter and so many others.
[00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:35.705]  I'll be doing a special transmission tomorrow.
[00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:37.166]  2 to 4 p.m.
[00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:41.710]  commercial free on all the InfoWars streams covering the latest news and Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:52.860]   I've been doing that for a long time now Owen does Sunday live after me 6 to 8 central and again it's commercial free and that we run some network commercials for local stations we keep those for them But we don't have any of our commercials.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.981]  Alright, again, thank you so much for watching.
[00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.942]  Spread the word about this.
[00:05:56.243 --> 00:05:57.964]  This is another big story we broke first.
[00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:07.512]  We forced out in the open before they tried it, and then right on time they tried it, and it got rejected because we didn't get caught with our pants down, they got caught with their pants down.
[00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:10.455]  So, good for General Milley and others getting on the right side of history.
[00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:12.397]  God bless you all, and God bless America.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.727]  You know, Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out.
[00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:31.278]  And eventually, I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.
[00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.312]  The fact is, whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:46.518]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected President of the United States.
[00:06:46.818 --> 00:06:48.039]  But there is a process.
[00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:58.385]  It has nothing to do with that the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:01.227]  It's not geography or location.
[00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:13.851]  It has been suggested that this is a trial run for the President of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the election.
[00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:17.052]  If he's not elected, is he going to pull out?
[00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:18.777]  His military?
[00:07:19.217 --> 00:07:20.617]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:26.260]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not re-elected.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.481]  This is dangerous.
[00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:30.322]  We are trying to find out more about it.
[00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:40.207]  And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:42.028]  It's really actually shameful.
[00:07:42.348 --> 00:07:43.749]  Enemies of the state.
[00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:53.941]  He's talking about sending these unmarked paramilitary guards to places with Democratic, blue states with very blue cities run by Democratic mayors.
[00:07:54.281 --> 00:08:05.263]  I think we should all take very seriously the prospect that this is, as I say, a dress rehearsal, a trial run for first an attempt at voter intimidation on election day.
[00:08:05.423 --> 00:08:15.405]   Are these unmarked paramilitary units going to be doing security at the polls in battleground I think that's a question we'd like to have answered.
[00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:17.226]  Are you concerned about that?
[00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:22.348]  That these paramilitary forces will be used to suppress the vote using intimidation and fear?
[00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:27.130]  I mean, if you'd ask me that question about any other president, I would say, of course not.
[00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.912]  That's, you know, the script from a very bad movie.
[00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:37.015]  But this administration, this president has demonstrated that they have a capacity to go lower than we can even possibly imagine.
[00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:39.716]  So, yeah, I think we have to be concerned about that.
[00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:46.379]   His attempt to Talk about mail-in voting and all the fraud that is associated with it is factually incorrect.
[00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:53.121]  He's just trying to set up a situation where he has the ability to delegitimize a vote that he might lose.
[00:08:53.701 --> 00:09:06.686]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss and what he'll do for the time period between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:10.468]  We have to be prepared for things that this nation has never faced before.
[00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:15.730]  And unfortunately, that could involve the use of these forces.
[00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:23.813]  Who knows what he'll do and the people who are as part of his administration will support him in doing.
[00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:26.074]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:30.116]  This is the guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent.
[00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:36.767]  Have you ever considered what would happen if the election result came out as you being the winner and Trump refused to leave?
[00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:38.628]  Yes, I have.
[00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:39.948]  I was so damn proud.
[00:09:39.988 --> 00:09:44.910]  You have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:52.993]  And you have so many rank and file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[00:09:53.033 --> 00:09:54.054]  This is not who we are.
[00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:59.996]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:05.695]  The year is 2020.
[00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:25.975]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable terrorists that have rocked the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population of a once united country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:37.148]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, diving headlong towards economic ruin, and already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic enslavement.
[00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:42.073]  The final takedown order has been issued, the direct attack has begun.
[00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:47.325]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[00:10:48.085 --> 00:10:53.587]  InfoWars Emergency Transmissions are now broadcasting live weeknights 7 to 9 p.m.
[00:10:53.667 --> 00:11:00.590]  Central Standard Time, Election Countdown, Taking America Back on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.852]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
