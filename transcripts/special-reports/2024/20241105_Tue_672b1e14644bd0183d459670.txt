[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]  General Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, and they tried to make him a political prisoner, the guy that the system fears.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.399]  General Flynn, thank you and your busy schedule for briefly joining us to give us an update since we talked five, six hours ago.
[00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.420]  General, what's the latest?
[00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.350]  Yeah, so for everybody, and Alex, thank you so much.
[00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.129]  I have joining me here the owner of Papa John's Pizza.
[00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.570]  He's got about, what, 6,000 stores, right?
[00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.489]  6,000.
[00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.789]  Go ahead.
[00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.750]  Good to be here, General.
[00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.670]  Go, Trump!
[00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.450]  Yeah.
[00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.670]  So we're here at Seated Table.
[00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.270]  You know about Seated Table, the happiest place on Earth.
[00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.570]  Alex, I'll tell you, I think that we're going to have a hands-down victory for Donald Trump tonight.
[00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.609]  You know, we've already made some calls in a couple of places, a couple of states.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.700]  One of the things that I... You know, we're here in Florida, and one of the big bellwether counties in Florida, and this isn't for the Florida vote.
[00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.179]  This is really for the national vote because of the reflection of people in Miami-Dade County.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.459]  But Miami-Dade County looks like it's going to go for Donald Trump, which is a big, big deal.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.420]  And what that means is that the Rust Belt, the Rust Belt of this country, which a lot of people come...
[00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:19.030]  We're good to go.
[00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:36.510]  I don't want people to get too crazy yet, but I do believe that what we're going to see is hands down Georgia, North Carolina.
[00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.329]  I'm hopeful that Virginia comes through.
[00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:40.969]  It's going to be a tough, tight race.
[00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.269]  I've been in touch with some friends up in New Jersey.
[00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.650]  New Jersey's going to be a tight race, but New Jersey could come into Trump's win column.
[00:01:49.969 --> 00:02:01.069]  I think that Pennsylvania, and because of the giant Outpouring right now of people that have come out of work, primarily men up in the western counties of Pennsylvania.
[00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.329]  Looks like Pennsylvania will go.
[00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:13.110]  And if those western counties go for Trump in the numbers that I think they're going to go, then I absolutely see Michigan falling into a Trump win column.
[00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:21.949]  And you know, Alex, I've had my moments with the Muslim community, but that endorsement by By Dr.
[00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:39.509]  Amor from Hamtramck, Michigan, this morning at about 1 o'clock, a gentleman that Alfie Oaks and I met with about a year ago, that is a huge, huge endorsement because that community up in Michigan and that community also bleeds over into other places like Minnesota,
[00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.210]  Wisconsin, but that community in Michigan, they vote at about 90 to 95 percent.
[00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:56.930]  So what we're seeing is we're seeing an outpouring of frustration, you know, in the voting that is taking place, the outtakes from the voters, a lot of frustration with the direction of the country.
[00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:06.849]  I think it's like 70, more than 70% of the people voting in this country right now are voting because they're frustrated with the direction of the country and they want something fresh.
[00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.150]  And we've already experienced Donald Trump as the president and know what he can do and what he's capable of doing.
[00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.139]  The other thing, Alex, is the independent vote.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.879]  So the independent vote right now, clearly in Georgia, but I think overall, we're going to see an independent vote go for Donald Trump.
[00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:30.539]  And I think that big reason is because I call that the Bobby Kennedy effect, the Kennedy effect.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.419]  So let me throw it over to Papa John here for a second.
[00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.360]  Give us your two cents on where you think the election's going.
[00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.810]  Well, America works when America works, and we've got to protect that middle class, and Trump's our guy.
[00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.189]  Trump will put the middle class, the lower middle class, the upper middle class back on their feet.
[00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:52.689]  He'll do it quick, he'll do it efficiently, and he'll make things happen.
[00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:53.770]  We've got to get him in there.
[00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.599]  Yeah.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.500]  So, Alex, here's where I think we're at.
[00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.659]  This is for your great audience.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.080]  And when we were on earlier, Alex, I think we had over 250,000 viewers.
[00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:10.319]  We probably have doubled that number by the time we got to this point.
[00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.259]  Let me just tell you, that was one feed you were looking at.
[00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.240]  We had about, not counting our other systems, millions listing while you were on.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.980]  Now on all of our streams, there's 5 million people on them right now.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.720]  Yeah, beautiful.
[00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:23.240]  I love it.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.860]  Five million viewers, okay?
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.500]  Sitting here with Papa John.
[00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.819]  So Papa John's going to owe me a couple of pizzas here, right?
[00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.800]  So here's where we are.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.959]  Here's where we are for your great audience and for the people that matter.
[00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:40.620]  So first of all, Alex Jones has been right for the last 20 years.
[00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.899]  And I told this to Alex the first time I met him.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:54.279]  When I first met Alex, actually when I first heard about Alex and was listening to him, he was talking about this globalist group of Of thugs, mainly, from the World Economic Forum.
[00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.839]  So fast forward to the last eight years, and that's what the United States of America is up against.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.420]  We're up against a globalist takeover, and we went through, and I talked about this earlier, Alex, with you, we went through the whole Wuhan-China virus, right?
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:20.019]  China, the Chinese have not only, they only brought in the COVID virus globally, not just here in the United States, but China has been bringing in this fentanyl.
[00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.720]  They've stuffed it with horse tranquilizer over the last year.
[00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.439]  We have over 200,000 killed in action.
[00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:42.110]  One of the things that the globalists want to do, and they have partners inside of the current administration, particularly inside the Biden-Harris administration, whether or not this makes a difference for voters tonight, Doesn't matter at this point because we are at late hours here.
[00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:43.470]  But this is what we're up against.
[00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:53.709]  And we have got to defeat these people because what they want to do with this illegal human migration worldwide, it's not only in Europe, it's right here in this country.
[00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.930]  We've got close to 22 million illegals.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.680]  Wandering around the United States of America.
[00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:08.459]  We have the Mexican cartels taken by the nose by the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:18.839]  We have the Chinese Communist Party has infiltrated damn near every institution of our government and our education system and Christ even buying up real estate in this country.
[00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:34.050]  We are in a tough spot, but what we need to do is once we win this election, and we're going to win it, I don't know if we're going to know the outcome of the vote tonight, because I do think that we're going to have some of these Democrat...
[00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:39.439]  Governors withhold whether or not they're going to call a race or not.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.360]  We'll see.
[00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:48.800]  I mean, Kamala Harris this morning needed 700,000 votes to beat Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.
[00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.680]  There's no way in the world that she was going to get that.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.480]  People just don't like this woman.
[00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.699]  I mean, you know, God help us, right?
[00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.100]  Uncle Joe.
[00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:58.240]  Joe Biden.
[00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.019]  Joe Biden.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.379]  Another piece of breaking news.
[00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:07.160]  Joe Biden said he would not attend the campaign event for Kamala Harris tonight.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.220]  Maybe it's because the guy can't sleep or can't stay awake past four o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.199]  But...
[00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:18.019]  That's a big indicator to me about the differences of opinion.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:29.939]  General, I totally agree because he knows they basically, as we know, we first reported with others, as you did, that they grabbed him, drugged him in Nevada, flew him from Vegas to Delaware.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.360]  He disappears eight days as a fake resignation signature.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:40.540]  Now he wears Trump hats, sabotages Kamala, and now his wife went and voted today in an all MAGA red outfit.
[00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.259]  I think they're looking for a Trump pardon.
[00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.120]  What do you think, General?
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:59.019]  I mean, that's what you call in-your-face, Kamala, by Jill Biden, and it's in-your-face, Obama, by Jill Biden, because even they're sick—yeah, there she is, there you go—they're sick and tired of even themselves.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:11.319]  I mean, these people— One of the things that I've always said, Alex, and I've said this on your great show before to your great audience, their arrogance and their attitude will be their downfall.
[00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:14.560]  And these people are terrible, and they're terribly arrogant.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.540]  They have no soul.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.920]  They have no faith.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.980]  They do not believe in any...
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.439]  They don't have the same beliefs that I have, and I'll speak for myself.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.560]  But this is a time where...
[00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:29.920]  And I know this, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and I think it was Michigan.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.440]  I got a report from Jack Masovic about an hour and a half ago.
[00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:41.159]  As people, as men primarily, were coming out of work, the lines started to form again in those states.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.779]  So I mean, this is a really important time.
[00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:44.940]  I like what I'm seeing.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.039]  I like what I'm feeling.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.100]  I like the energy.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.139]  You know, President Trump took it all out on the field.
[00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:51.480]  He left it all out on the field.
[00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:56.519]  He finished his last rally in Michigan, the state of Michigan, at about 2 o'clock this morning.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.659]  You know, I had an exchange with him this morning with people like Tucker.
[00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:02.179]  I spoke with Vivek.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.139]  And went back and forth with Bobby Kennedy and Eric Trump as well.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.039]  Everybody's very excited.
[00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:18.720]  We all want to hold our time here because like me, I'm a little bit superstitious as an athlete.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.860]  I'm one of those baseball players that jumps over the line.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.940]  You know, on third, you know, between the catchers, between the home plate and third base, I don't touch the line, so a little bit superstitious.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:37.220]  I want the election to be called tonight, and I do believe by all rights we should see it called tonight, so...
[00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:46.090]  You know, one of the things that I want to do, Alex, is make sure that your great audience of millions and millions of people know, thank each and every one of you.
[00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:55.149]  I call this the podcast presidency, the podcast presidency because of the rise of citizen journalism, the rise of podcasters.
[00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.950]  Alex, there's been nobody stronger, nobody more courageous than you.
[00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:04.860]  And doing what you've been doing for decades, for years, and calling out the truth.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.139]  So I love you, brother, and keep doing it to your great audience.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.399]  We've got to continue to support people like you, and I know that you get out there and you're hustling right now.
[00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.500]  We're all behind you.
[00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:17.440]  Thank you so much.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.840]  You've got a great team there, and we definitely appreciate everything that you have been doing for this country.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.309]  Without people like you at the pointy end of the spear, Most people would be asleep and not have a clue about what this globalism threat that we are facing is all about.
[00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:38.149]  Well, General Flynn, please let me just say this about you and Papa John, big fan of him, know about his great work.
[00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.779]  Look, We're all in this together and the best part of this fight is I get to know the best men and women out there.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:59.190]  I look at the quality of Trump's supporters and his advisors like you from the beginning and I just look at the honor and the decency and the legitimacy and the realness of us Versus Kamala and Walls and the scum.
[00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.330]  And America's waking up.
[00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:01.269]  The world's waking up.
[00:11:01.409 --> 00:11:02.210]  So just...
[00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.389]  I know you probably gotta go.
[00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:05.669]  You're very gracious to pop back on as we learn more in the night.
[00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.029]  I know you're doing a great job doing so many great shows.
[00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.509]  Pop back in with your great intel.
[00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.450]  But I feel and see on the streets the same thing.
[00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:13.169]  Huge awakening.
[00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.970]  Huge explosion.
[00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.309]  We're seeing indicators of it.
[00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:16.850]  I'm still worried they're trying to steal it.
[00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.330]  Trump posted three hours ago that he thinks...
[00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:20.950]  And there's evidence.
[00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.889]  James O'Keefe proved it.
[00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:22.850]  They're trying to steal...
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.080]  Pennsylvania by stuffing the ballot boxes and illegals voting in Philadelphia.
[00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.200]  What's your view on that?
[00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:36.039]  Yeah, that's the only way that these people can win anything, is by cheating.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.419]  And so we want this nonsense to stop, you know?
[00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:49.019]  And let me just add, because I know we're going to run short on time, because I'm here with the great Papa John, and, you know, these guys don't care who comes into their office.
[00:11:49.049 --> 00:11:51.470]  Who comes into their pizza place to buy pizza?
[00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.029]  They don't care if somebody's black, Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean.
[00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.610]  But all of these are Americans at this point in time.
[00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:02.029]  I'm telling you, the entire world is watching.
[00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.629]  Over the last couple of years, I have gone around to these different communities.
[00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:12.149]  The Serbian community, the Hungarian American community, the Polish American community, the Indonesian American, Filipino community.
[00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:22.269]  These represent millions and millions of people and one of the things that President Trump did was he went out into these communities like he did when I talked about the Muslim community.
[00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:30.009]  He went out into these communities purposely and talked to them authentically and said look Do you like the direction that this country is going?
[00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.590]  And obviously the answer is no.
[00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:37.190]  So, you know, like anybody that walks into Papa John's, they'll sell you a slice of pizza.
[00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:47.169]  And anybody that comes into America, as long as you come in legally, we want you, we love you, we'll embrace you, and we're going to take you on the greatest fight you've ever been on.
[00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.950]  God bless you.
[00:12:48.049 --> 00:12:48.750]  God bless you.
[00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.350]  General Flynn, as you warned today...
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.480]  Once we get Trump in, in the 76 days while he's president-elect, that's when the real hell breaks us.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.759]  We're about to win a major battle.
[00:12:58.879 --> 00:12:59.679]  I hope you're right.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.700]  But the real war is about to start.
[00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:03.080]  Any closing comments from Papa John?
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.279]  Yeah, last thing.
[00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:05.659]  Go ahead.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.639]  Totally agree.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.120]  This is a good first table.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.159]  I mean, we got...
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.340]  This is a good versus evil.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.580]  I mean, no doubt about that.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.500]  And Trump's our guy.
[00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.720]  But we got the Super Bowl tonight.
[00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.720]  And it's the Patriots versus the Steelers.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.059]  And Trump's our guy.
[00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:24.700]  But, yeah, this is the work starts once we get into office.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.299]  I mean, this is a Hercules kind of task that he's got to do to get this country.
[00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:30.159]  But he's our guy.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.320]  And you're right.
[00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:37.460]  And for your audience, because we mentioned this earlier, you know, getting to this point was hard.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:48.840]  But if you think that's hard, folks, wait until post-victory between now and inauguration and then inauguration, you know, to do the kinds of things to make America great again.
[00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.350]  That's going to be real hard.
[00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:52.090]  That's going to require a lot of sacrifice.
[00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.990]  So get yourself a deep breath tonight, folks.
[00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:02.889]  You know, get some rest tonight because when tomorrow, you know, when that heat tab comes up and that sun comes up, that's when the real work begins.
[00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:03.789]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:04.570]  Thank you so much.
[00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.909]  All right.
[00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:05.649]  Thank you, General Flynn.
[00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:05.950]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.769]  Thank you, sir.
[00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:13.789]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:29.070]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air, It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it, and you're getting the best deal you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:32.309]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.730]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:50.120]  This is a high-quality, made-in-Texas, very strong CBD, 1,000-milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:15:00.679]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:07.610]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.590]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:18.850]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:25.649]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit JonesCBD.com.
[00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:27.850]  JonesCBD.com.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.200]  Let me tell you the names of these products.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.320]  Ultra Green, because it's amazing.
[00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.620]  And Dreamwave.
[00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:38.059]  You want to get both of these and it supports the broadcast.
[00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:39.980]  You will not be disappointed.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:47.860]  Particularly if you're already into CBD and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying and you get a great response.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.019]  I know you're going to love it.
[00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:53.500]  That's what I'm looking for is repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.
[00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:54.620]  Thanks for your support.
[00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:59.639]  This is the best deal out there, and it funds the fight against tyranny, a total 360 win.
[00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:03.200]  Visit jonescbd.com today, and I thank you for your support.
[00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:06.940]  And we've got more election results coming in right now.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.740]  Let's go to Owen Schroyer and Harrison Smith here in Austin, Texas.
[00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.570]  All right, Alex, I'd say right now we've got good news.
[00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.110]  I'd say overall things right now are looking pretty good.
[00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:22.129]  Remember, we just need to get to 270.
[00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.269]  Ohio, trending in the direction of Trump after some early numbers were going blue.
[00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:30.110]  Ohio is looking good right where it should be.
[00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:37.740]  We'll dig more into that Senate race, but Ohio Looks good and it could help Republicans gain a seat in the Senate.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:45.200]  Now, early numbers were favoring the Democrats in Virginia and North Carolina starting to trend the other way.
[00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:47.100]  Starting to trend the other way.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.480]  In fact, I think North Carolina numbers are good.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.720]  Virginia is going to be a little tougher.
[00:16:53.579 --> 00:17:01.379]  But these states are fully in play right now, and I like what I'm seeing in North Carolina, and I think there's a shot Trump can even win Virginia.
[00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:05.460]  Some of these sites have called New Jersey.
[00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.400]  It's still kind of tight, but I guess they're just assuming that's going to go blue.
[00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.720]  We could have an interesting result in Maine.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.859]  Maybe it's unconsequential with only four electoral college votes, but this is going to be a tight race.
[00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:19.839]  Four electoral college votes could be key.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:27.579]  In this race, so these are the numbers that we have early, but I really like what I'm seeing in Georgia right now, Alex.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:36.380]  I have to say, I really like what I'm seeing in Georgia, and if these numbers persist, I think Trump's gonna pull off Georgia.
[00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:37.900]  It's gonna be a small margin.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.799]  Again, it's all gonna come down to the numbers that they get out of Fulton County and DeKalb County, but this thing is gonna be tight.
[00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:47.019]  This thing in Georgia is gonna be tight.
[00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:55.809]  I mean, if they swap the vote in Atlanta like they did in 2020, I don't know.
[00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.130]  But if they don't triple count ballots, if we don't have all the shenanigans in Atlanta...
[00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:11.319]  I think Trump wins Georgia tonight, and all of a sudden, these early returns give Trump the path to victory of little resistance.
[00:18:11.779 --> 00:18:22.079]  If he can win North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Ohio, all he has to win is Nevada at that point, as Maine has flipped back blue.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:29.779]  It's going to be tight, as we suspected, Alex, but right now, I think things are kind of right on par where we thought they would go.
[00:18:31.299 --> 00:18:31.960]  Sorry, Harrison.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.720]  I mean, Owen, you are the statistic guy around here.
[00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.539]  So is Roger Stone, but you know your stuff.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.599]  You've been pessimistic.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.180]  Elaborate for everybody that's a little slow like me why this is good news.
[00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:54.559]  Well, basically, when you look at Georgia, we don't have many of the rural areas that are deep red and are likely going to show up 70-80% plus for Donald Trump.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:01.119]  Whereas in Atlanta, and that's DeKalb County and Fulton County, you have the results coming in.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.420]  Now, you're still probably...
[00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:06.700]  Maybe 70% of where you're gonna be.
[00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:21.799]  But if that number persists, with Harris getting less than 80% of the vote in Fulton County and DeKalb County, and the rural areas with 0% returns right now, the numbers favor Donald Trump.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:48.059]  So unless 100% of the votes the rest of the way in DeKalb and Fulton County are for Harris, We're good to go.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.160]  I just like what I'm seeing.
[00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:52.319]  I'm not calling Georgia.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.660]  I'm not calling it.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.920]  I'm just saying I like where it's trending right now.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.700]  Now, Virginia always kind of does this.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.099]  It flips up and down all night.
[00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:03.039]  This is tight.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.220]  This thing right now is within 20,000 votes.
[00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:10.000]  That, to me, tells me that Trump is already outperforming.
[00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:17.240]  When I look at the early returns, Harris is not performing how she needs to perform in Northern Virginia.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.160]  She's just not.
[00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:23.869]  She's not going to get a 70% clip, I think, in any of these counties.
[00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:26.309]  And I think she needed a 70% clip.
[00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:29.029]  She's not getting it in Norfolk.
[00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:34.670]  She's close in Richmond, but she's not there in Richmond.
[00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.930]  It's really early there.
[00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:42.769]  But the point is, Harris needs 70% of the votes in these big Democrat cities.
[00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:50.369]  Anything less than that, then she's going to be overwhelmed by the rural areas that are going to be deep red, 80% for Trump.
[00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:52.269]  That's what we're seeing in Virginia.
[00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.849]  Virginia's on a razor's edge.
[00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:57.750]  North Carolina is trending Trump big time.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.359]  I really like what I'm seeing in North Carolina.
[00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:04.839]  Now, Harris is doing very well in the big cities.
[00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:06.640]  She's doing very well in Durham.
[00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.279]  She's doing very well in Raleigh.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.539]  Again, these are all early numbers.
[00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:10.400]  Let me just clarify.
[00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:11.619]  These are all early numbers.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.200]  But I think the rural vote in North Carolina can compete with this.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.940]  I like what I'm seeing in these states.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.000]  I'll just put it like that.
[00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.400]  I like what I'm seeing in these states.
[00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:26.960]  I'm not calling any of these states, but I'm seeing the path to victory for Trump.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.359]  Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia would be the bonus.
[00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:37.720]  If he wins those four states, he doesn't need Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.380]  He can win it with Nevada.
[00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:42.220]  That's the path to victory that I see for Donald Trump.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.259]  Virginia's still in the blue.
[00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.400]  But forget it.
[00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.200]  Forget it.
[00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:52.799]  If he wins Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, that's the path of least resistance now with Ohio.
[00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.019]  All he needs is Nevada.
[00:21:54.259 --> 00:22:00.920]  You don't even need Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, where the Democrats engage in so many shenanigans as we've seen all day long.
[00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:04.000]  So it's right where I expected it to be.
[00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:07.819]  These numbers are still early, but I like the way it's trending.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.559]  Harrison Smith, I cut you off.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.039]  No, yeah, I was just going to talk about how incredibly close it is in somewhere like North Carolina for a long time.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.180]  I mean, the difference between Trump and Kamala was about 100 votes, give or take.
[00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:25.559]  But it did just take a big jump up towards Trump.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.259]  So, no, I don't have too much to add to what Owen is saying, other than that it's still very early.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.180]  And a lot of these are sort of flipping back and forth.
[00:22:34.299 --> 00:22:39.599]  And it does look like Virginia is leaning Trump at this point by about half a percent.
[00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:45.089]  So, again, still very, very, very close, and we're, you know, less than an hour out from when polls closed.
[00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:50.230]  So, it's thrilling, but it's looking better as we go.
[00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.950]  Man, if Trump gets in, this will be a day long remembered.
[00:22:56.289 --> 00:22:56.730]  Sorry.
[00:23:00.369 --> 00:23:02.609]  We're too nervous to laugh right now.
[00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:04.910]  Megatron, prepare to die.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.400]  No, it's looking good.
[00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:12.539]  Texas still looking very good.
[00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:15.339]  It looks like they've called Illinois for Kamala Harris.
[00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:17.619]  And the count right now stands at 71.
[00:23:17.859 --> 00:23:24.579]  Harris 101 Trump with the overall results leaning steadily more towards Trump right now.
[00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:27.980]  The needle on, according to the New York Times...
[00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:30.900]  Has the outcome at about 278 Trump.
[00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.039]  So we're projected for a Trump victory.
[00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:37.940]  But of course, unless, would you say 100% results in these Georgia cities?
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.299]  What would that look like on a graph?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.279]  Would that be a straight up line if they get 100% for Biden on that?
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.200]  Yeah, it would be.
[00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:44.420]  It would be your vote, Viagra.
[00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.960]  It would be your vote, steroids, like you saw in 2020.
[00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:53.339]  You know, Pennsylvania is still an interesting case because we haven't gotten a lot of the deep red areas.
[00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:56.039]  I'm really upset to see what's going on in Erie.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.059]  It's still early there.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.740]  I don't understand.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.359]  Trump won Erie in 2016, and he just, for whatever reason, lost in 2020.
[00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:05.299]  And it's early, but it's just, you know, these are the trends.
[00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:08.660]  I think what we're going to see, though, I really think what we're going to see...
[00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:13.019]  I think Harris is going to have to outperform Biden in Philadelphia.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.420]  Harris is going to have to outperform Biden in Philadelphia.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:26.579]  She's trending with the same percentage that Biden had, a little higher, but she's going to have to get probably 650,000 votes in Philadelphia, I think, to win Pennsylvania.
[00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:30.619]  Pennsylvania is going to be tight all night, and it may be too tight.
[00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:31.980]  They may just refuse to call it.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.619]  But based on some of these other trends, Trump might not need it.
[00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.410]  Well, I mean, I've never seen Flynn so confident, and Roger's usually very pessimistic.
[00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:43.150]  As you know, Sunday night, he said no.
[00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.109]  He thinks it could well go for Trump tonight.
[00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:55.250]  Yeah, and remember, some of the counties in Pennsylvania that are deep red are the ones that there were shenanigans being played, and they've actually extended until 10 p.m., right?
[00:24:55.309 --> 00:25:00.049]  So we're not going to get any of those results for at least another couple hours, or at least an hour and a half.
[00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:01.150]  Yeah, the returns are very low.
[00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:02.269]  Yeah, super low in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.509]  But those are the red areas.
[00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:04.150]  That's the key.
[00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:06.589]  Those are the red areas where we're going to get those late returns.
[00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:13.019]  And so we're looking at only 12% of the vote in for Pennsylvania right now, with Kamala Harris leading decisively.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.059]  But again, that's because a lot of these rural areas have not reported yet.
[00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:23.740]  In Ohio, we're looking at 43% of the votes in already, and Trump at 51%.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.059]  So still very close there, but at least a larger percentage of reports in.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.220]  And it's still leaning red and looks like it's going to stay that way.
[00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:31.759]  Same with Georgia.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.680]  But, I mean, he's up 11 points in Georgia right now.
[00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:38.539]  So, looking very good in that regard.
[00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:40.119]  Same in North Carolina.
[00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:44.819]  Yeah, it's not like they close the polls and he's only, you know, two points ahead.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.319]  No.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.980]  If he's at 11 points ahead, he's like Georgia.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.200]  Bitch, you ain't gonna be able to step enough ballast to get that done.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.420]  Yeah, and the results in Georgia for tonight, we don't have many results, which I think actually favors Trump.
[00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:04.319]  Most of these results are from early voting and mail-in voting, which usually favors the Democrats.
[00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:08.180]  So I really, again, I don't want to call Georgia.
[00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:12.099]  Here's the difference, Alex.
[00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.130]  This is the same thing we saw in 2020.
[00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.869]  The difference was, in 2020, they played the trick on us.
[00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:20.309]  They ran the flea flicker.
[00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.690]  They ran the fumble ruski.
[00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:23.190]  They shut down the polls.
[00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.250]  They went back.
[00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:26.230]  They pulled out their secret troves of ballots.
[00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:31.690]  Biden got the 300,000 votes that he needed to win at 3 o'clock in the morning when everybody was sleeping.
[00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:32.750]  We got them.
[00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:33.809]  We know this time.
[00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:36.430]  If they try to pull a stunt like that, it'll be too obvious.
[00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.329]  We caught them double, triple, quadruple counting ballots in Fulton County.
[00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.930]  People got arrested for that.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.640]  This is big.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.299]  You know, I anticipated, I think Trump needed Georgia, but it will just feel good.
[00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:53.559]  I will feel a lot calmer when I see Georgia called for Trump.
[00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.319]  That'll really make me feel good.
[00:26:55.779 --> 00:27:02.539]  And then they're doing a hypersonic nuclear weapons test, nuclear weapons delivery system test tonight.
[00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:09.099]  And, I mean, it's all just, again, it's not just they're claiming Russia with no evidence is hacking Georgia.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:22.279]  We're good to go.
[00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:37.640]  Putin says, we're too big.
[00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:40.119]  We sold you Alaska for a few million bucks.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.039]  We're not trying to take you over.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.720]  Yeah, when the commies ran it, they were.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.779]  Our own criminal Western governments put in as a disease on them.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.400]  The Russians want to make money.
[00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:50.839]  They want to be successful.
[00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:51.480]  They want to...
[00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:54.779]  Again, the CHICOMs are up our rear end.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.140]  Israel's up our rear end.
[00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.779]  The EU's up our rear end.
[00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:01.119]  Hollywood, the left, BlackRock, that's who has all the power, big tech.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:13.200]  The Russians have flex power, propaganda-wise, that is incredibly weak, except Americans in the world see that the Russians are pulling away from leftist ideology, so we say, oh good, we wish you luck.
[00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:15.779]  But the Russians have no flex.
[00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:17.960]  The Russians aren't doing anything.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.160]  Oh God, we caught them...
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.140]  Paying for news programs, 10 million bucks, and running ad campaigns, 10 million dollars?
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.920]  Again, that's like a flea compared to a frickin' elephant.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:28.640]  Sorry.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.720]  By the way, I got some good news to report.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:43.549]  The Republicans are gonna gain a seat in the Senate in West Virginia, the seat that Joe Manchin left in It looks like Jim Justice is on his way to victory over Glenn Elliott.
[00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:49.509]  And now you're looking at at least plus one in the Senate for Republicans.
[00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.490]  Now you're looking more plus two or even three.
[00:28:56.009 --> 00:28:57.150]  That is very good news.
[00:28:57.589 --> 00:29:00.049]  Let's just slow down here because we've been so focused on Trump.
[00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:02.109]  At least I have.
[00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.069]  I know Owen and you have been covering it well, but that was before the numbers were coming in.
[00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.490]  The House and the Senate are beyond critical.
[00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:13.869]  And so, wow, the fact that that Senate seat in West Virginia, that is devastating.
[00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.710]  So they're calling that right now.
[00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.529]  It's over.
[00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.109]  It's over.
[00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.150]  It's a dominating, it's a dominated race.
[00:29:20.329 --> 00:29:23.369]  Justice just crushed the Democrat, Glenn Elliott.
[00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:24.990]  And I will tell you the other thing, Alex.
[00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.450]  Again, I'm being conservative, saying plus one in the Senate.
[00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:37.869]  Now, plus one is pretty much a guarantee, I would say, because I think Tester is going to lose to Sheehy in Montana.
[00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:44.130]  And with what I'm seeing in Ohio right now, I think that Moreno could unseat Brown.
[00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.089]  So there you go.
[00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:48.410]  There's your Republican Senate right there.
[00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.029]  Oh, no, that's an old video of him winning in 2016.
[00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.789]  Yeah, we want to be doing this again at 2 a.m.
[00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:54.490]  like last time.
[00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:56.930]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.450]  Oh, my God.
[00:29:59.829 --> 00:30:03.250]  You know, I haven't drank a drop in a long time, but I don't know about tonight.
[00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.069]  A drunk wins.
[00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:07.150]  How much alcohol is in the building?
[00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:11.490]  We'll find you some sparkling juice.
[00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.869]  Oh, my God.
[00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.029]  Somebody get to the liquor store immediately.
[00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.670]  No, it's like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.630]  Let's not start you-know-what-ing each other yet.
[00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.809]  Okay, sorry.
[00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:21.509]  Anything else?
[00:30:21.809 --> 00:30:23.250]  Repeat that news again, please.
[00:30:23.869 --> 00:30:24.309]  So, yeah.
[00:30:24.849 --> 00:30:25.990]  With this seat...
[00:30:26.779 --> 00:30:30.380]  The Republicans essentially level out the Senate.
[00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:34.319]  And, I mean, look, between Ohio...
[00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:40.269]  And Montana, I think it's safe to say the Republicans are going to flip one of those seats.
[00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:45.910]  I would bet they flip both based off what I'm seeing right now in Ohio.
[00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.910]  It might be tight.
[00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:54.569]  So, I mean, I think it's safe to say the Republicans are going to take the Senate with at least a one-seat majority.
[00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.329]  Now you're looking at maybe a 200.
[00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:04.349]  And depending on how well Trump does in these other battleground states, three, maybe even four.
[00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:09.430]  But I think it's safe to say right now the Republicans are going to take control of the Senate.
[00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.910]  And, you know, the other good news about this too, Alex, Mitch McConnell is done as the Senate leadership.
[00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:15.549]  He's out.
[00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:21.410]  That worthless Republican senator is done as the Senate leadership.
[00:31:21.589 --> 00:31:26.930]  You're going to be looking at a new Senate leadership of a Josh Howley, maybe a Rand Paul.
[00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:35.809]  But the point is, you're gonna get serious leadership at the Senate level, not Mitch McConnell, who's about as useful as a poopy diaper.
[00:31:36.109 --> 00:31:37.630]  And so this is great news.
[00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:44.259]  If the Republicans take the Senate, plus with new Senate majority leadership, I mean, this is game-changing.
[00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:50.339]  I just want to say, thank God for the Great Awakening and whatever God's plan is, but thank God.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.259]  Candace Horbach, you've been sitting here for 20 minutes while we're ranting.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.380]  You're getting pretty excited.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.119]  What are you making of this?
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.839]  No, I was going to say, can we explain the significance of this to the people?
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.640]  Because everyone's really just looking at Trump and Kamala, so the significance of this seat.
[00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:09.339]  Well, if we win the Senate, which it looks like it's been done now, and half the states are more reporting, then we'll probably get more seats.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.720]  And so if we gain in the House and the Senate, then Trump gets sent.
[00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:13.819]  It's called the trifecta.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.779]  We have the legislative, we have the executive, and we have the judicial.
[00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:25.619]  And then we can actually purge the deep state legally and lawfully with a trifecta.
[00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:29.539]  I mean, I'm sure you've got that, but you want me to define it for people?
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.019]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:42.019]  No, and I think that's really exciting, too, because it's really hard, even if you have someone that you want to win that gets the presidential election, if he has everyone working against him, it's like, how much change can he actually be effective with?
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.200]  So yeah, that's really great news.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:43.900]  Exactly.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.440]  So he needs the infrastructure, the runway.
[00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.329]  Exactly.
[00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:48.109]  So that's really good.
[00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.170]  So how are you feeling right now?
[00:32:49.349 --> 00:32:49.950]  I'm excited.
[00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:56.109]  And then earlier they were saying he might not even need Pennsylvania, which is good after seeing that video, which is alarming.
[00:32:56.369 --> 00:32:59.509]  So regardless, I think that needs to be investigated and people need to go to jail.
[00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:01.789]  If you have people illegally voting, how is that okay?
[00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:03.890]  And how is there not jail time for everyone that's doing that?
[00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:06.500]  And they've been caught red-handed.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.319]  I mean, they really overplayed their hand here.
[00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:08.740]  Yeah.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.740]  So, I mean, is anything going to come of that?
[00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:12.880]  And then I guess if Trump wins, is anything going to come of that?
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.500]  Because that's not okay.
[00:33:13.579 --> 00:33:19.460]  And when we voted in North Carolina, there was like an amendment to have non-citizens be allowed to vote.
[00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:20.799]  I'm like, who is saying yes to this?
[00:33:21.309 --> 00:33:27.990]  Who's like, yes, we want illegal immigrants to be able to vote because their needs are aligned with the American people that are paying taxes and came here the right way.
[00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:29.049]  That makes no sense at all.
[00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.809]  Absolutely.
[00:33:30.589 --> 00:33:35.089]  I'm going to send a tweet out that it looks like, well, we have won the Senate.
[00:33:35.609 --> 00:33:36.869]  I mean, that's the numbers.
[00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.950]  And Owen, you're the numbers guy.
[00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:41.849]  Does it look like we're going to get even more in the Senate then?
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:51.460]  Again, I mean, you look at the Montana and Ohio seats, I think at least one of them flips.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.200]  I mean, I think at least one of them flips, probably two.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:03.039]  And now you're just looking at what's going to go on in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Arizona, in Nevada.
[00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:12.119]  If Trump can pull these other Senate candidates across the finish line, you know, here's the problem with the Senate race, though.
[00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:32.929]  We're good to go.
[00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:50.320]  We're good to go.
[00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:07.860]  I think Republicans come out of this deal, and Nevada, I'd say it's probably safe to say Republicans could come out of this with a plus three in the Senate.
[00:35:10.929 --> 00:35:12.989]  We have all been so persecuted.
[00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.070]  Owen spent four months in jail.
[00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:30.949]  In the indictment, they said that he did not work at Infowars and that he lied, saying that he was with me outside the Capitol, stopping people getting in, despite the fact that Owen had worked here for many years before that, was my co-host, had his own popular show,
[00:35:31.969 --> 00:35:36.849]  When we hired him and when he was here before they took him off the internet, he had bigger videos on Facebook.
[00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:38.969]  He had one with 100 million views.
[00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:42.369]  One every day with like 50 million.
[00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:42.989]  It was insane.
[00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:45.269]  They told him in the diamond he's not really pressed.
[00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:46.250]  He didn't have a right to be there.
[00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:47.510]  The reason I bragged about him.
[00:35:47.869 --> 00:35:50.110]  I mean, if you've got hundreds of millions of views a day, I mean, that's kind of big.
[00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.829]  And they then put him in prison and they...
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.699]  Because they conceded.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:56.900]  Mr.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:13.380]  Jones is a reporter, and he did try to get people out, and we might indict him, but Owen, Your Honor, was not there, and he went in the Capitol, and he did never win the Capitol, and just total lies in a federal filings that you don't even believe they're that criminal, and the public doesn't know it until it happens to you,
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:34.340]  and I guess that's why black folks who have been screwed over a lot We're good to go.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.460]  Oh, and four months.
[00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:49.380]  I mean, and then they've attacked my family, persecuted the living hell out of me, fake judgments, fake rigged trials, stuff I won't even get into.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.059]  It takes too long.
[00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:59.539]  We've all got skin in the game, and I got to tell you, this is a new type of feeling, and I don't want to count my chickens yet, but my God, this is a level of not even satisfaction.
[00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:04.860]  I feel like a giant weight is starting to be lifted off of me, a big boot.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.920]  And I don't want to persecute these people.
[00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:10.599]  I don't want to get vengeance.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.480]  But if that means putting them all in prison to get them off our necks, yes, I want them off of me.
[00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:18.280]  I want them to leave me alone.
[00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:20.340]  Oh, and you're a former political prisoner.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:30.780]  What is this like for you to know that we have got these people politically in the information war in justice's sights right now?
[00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:44.389]  Well, you know, there's a demoralization factor, I think, that the American people have when you go through the rigmarole of the justice system legitimately or illegitimately for petty things even.
[00:37:44.650 --> 00:38:12.590]  And you know that the biggest criminals in the country are in Washington, D.C., I think it's probably worth mentioning at this point that there are still hundreds of January 6th political prisoners.
[00:38:13.389 --> 00:38:25.690]  And I hope that when Donald Trump gets into the White House, he reviews these cases and figures out which one are nonviolent offenders, which ones don't belong there, and starts to throw out pardons immediately.
[00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:27.690]  A lot of these are family men.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.739]  A lot of these are veterans, and they've been tortured.
[00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:38.039]  And so everything the Democrats accuse Trump or the Republicans of, they are guilty of.
[00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:42.940]  Using the military against the people, that's Democrat Department of Defense policy.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.440]  Arresting their political opposition, that's Democrat practice in the last four years.
[00:38:49.679 --> 00:39:00.150]  So, you know, look, you hate to say it, because you don't want to become your enemy, and yet I can't lie.
[00:39:00.329 --> 00:39:01.989]  I want a Trump redemption tour.
[00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:07.469]  And they keep saying these things like, oh, you know, Trump wants to become the president so he can go after his political enemies.
[00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.670]  And Trump wants to go after, he wants to become the president so he can go after the people that went after him.
[00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:13.190]  Good!
[00:39:14.799 --> 00:39:15.119]  Good!
[00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:17.360]  The people that went after Trump are the criminals.
[00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:18.460]  So good!
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.400]  If that's what this country needs, then good!
[00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:23.960]  I don't know if Trump has a vengeance to her in mind.
[00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:24.420]  But I really don't.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.380]  I want to go back to you.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:34.559]  Imagine federal filings in court when you're saying, I'm a journalist, I'm with Alex Jones, I'm trying to something to go in the building, we have all the body cams, the footage is all over the internet, and they say, no, Mr.
[00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:35.880]  Schurier never worked for Mr.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.699]  Jones, it was not with him, and he's not a journalist, and he's not a co-host.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.980]  In a federal filing, total perjury to the judge, and then the judge throws you in prison!
[00:39:45.089 --> 00:39:45.409]  Yeah.
[00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.050]  I mean, what?
[00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.849]  I mean, these people are a joke!
[00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.829]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.909]  Well, and Alex, and you've dealt with the court system as well.
[00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.650]  You know what it's like to be in that corner.
[00:39:55.829 --> 00:40:06.469]  You know what it's like to be in the triangle of the court system, and it's the judge, and it's the prosecuting attorneys, and then it's your defense attorneys, and you know what it's like when the whole thing is weighted against you.
[00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.969]  You know what it's like to be in that corner.
[00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.710]  You know what it's like to have everybody against you.
[00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:12.460]  And it's Twilight Zone.
[00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:18.860]  It's a Twilight Zone sinking, empty, lonely feeling to be in that position knowing that there is no justice.
[00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.980]  This isn't a courtroom of justice.
[00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:22.920]  This is a courtroom of persecution.
[00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:25.239]  This is a weaponized practice.
[00:40:25.719 --> 00:40:28.800]  And so very few people have had to deal with that like we have.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.579]  I don't wish it on my, I mean really I don't wish it on my worst enemy.
[00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:32.219]  I want justice.
[00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:32.860]  I want justice.
[00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:33.840]  That's what I want.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.420]  I want justice.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.900]  If we don't put them in prison for their crimes, they're going to do it to more people, and then we're aiding and abetting them.
[00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:41.360]  If we don't go after them, we are part of it.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.280]  Owen, we're going to come back to you.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.260]  We're going to take a quick break, and then bring Viva Frye on.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.519]  And just after this quick break, massive victory is apparent.
[00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.949]  The Globalist could detonate a nuke or something.
[00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.369]  I'm serious.
[00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:51.969]  They're that dangerous.
[00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.010]  They could kill Trump tonight, shoot his plane down with a missile.
[00:40:54.389 --> 00:40:58.949]  If he gets in there in the 76 days, they've promised insurrection, total insanity.
[00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.269]  We're going to come back with all of it.
[00:41:00.489 --> 00:41:01.690]  Candace Horbach is here with us.
[00:41:01.949 --> 00:41:02.889]  Mickey Willis coming in.
[00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.070]  It is a free-for-all live coverage.
[00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:12.449]  Folks, take the live feed from real Alex Jones and Infowars.com forward slash show and share it and say the people's coverage of what's really happening is on air.
[00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.150]  The best coverage anywhere will be right back.
[00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:15.769]  Stay with us.
[00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:23.929]  Candace Horbach, very popular talk show host and a really smart lady when it comes to trends.
[00:41:24.469 --> 00:41:31.449]  It looks like we are about to sweep massively, though I was just checking the news when we took a break.
[00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.829]  Ted Cruz, the early targeting, is barely ahead right now.
[00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:36.349]  That's scary.
[00:41:36.889 --> 00:41:37.750]  That is surprising.
[00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.929]  I was just checking North Carolina too, and my county looks like it's blue, which is so disappointing.
[00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:46.630]  So if you're in New Hanover County, stay in the lines, vote for Trump.
[00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:48.510]  There's no reason that that needs to be blue.
[00:41:48.909 --> 00:41:50.010]  North Carolina needs to flip.
[00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:51.489]  That's right.
[00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.510]  You deserve better North Carolina.
[00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:55.329]  Vote differently.
[00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:59.889]  Now let's bring in a very smart, he says recovering lawyer, but he knows the law.
[00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.389]  That's great.
[00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.269]  Now let's bring in Viva Frye here, and it's great to have him co-host with Robert Barnes.
[00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:12.340]  Wow, Viva, looking at this, you were on this morning, you were predicting a victory, so was General Flynn.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.500]  Looking now, I don't want to count our chickens yet, but it's looking good, Viva.
[00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:26.239]  Well, I'm following the markets as much as I'm watching the news because the markets were predicting Ohio before the news was.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:38.750]  So you know that the markets are more predictive, more accurate than the news itself, but Fingers crossed, despite the fact that Pennsylvania and what's the other state there, Arizona, are saying we might not know for days.
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:43.210]  You might not need to know certain things for days, but it might be clear enough as what's coming in tonight.
[00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:55.050]  It looks good, Alex, and I don't want to get ahead of anybody's, I don't want to get ahead of the ball, I don't want to count the chickens before they're hatched, but it's looking very good and the markets are reflecting that in real time as we speak.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:04.480]  And of course, the markets want Trump because Kamala and the globalists want to collapse the country to take it over instead of prosperity, Aviva.
[00:43:05.059 --> 00:43:06.440]  Get into the markets, what you're saying.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.659]  Well, actually, it's not even the, like, the aggregate trading markets.
[00:43:10.659 --> 00:43:11.719]  It's the predictive markets.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.219]  So you have, like, predicted, poly market.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.820]  This is not an ad, by the way, whatsoever.
[00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:17.599]  But you have these betting markets.
[00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:18.280]  No, it's the betting.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.380]  That, too.
[00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:20.329]  Yeah.
[00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:25.989]  They respond to the news before it actually reaches MSM. This is what's beautiful about it.
[00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.369]  The betting markets have people on the ground.
[00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:35.010]  When they get information, it filters up to the betting markets and gets reflected faster than it gets called for on Fox News.
[00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:44.550]  And so Ohio got basically not called, but spiked on the markets before the news was even saying, oh, the reporting is in.
[00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:50.320]  The betting markets are the easiest way, the most accurate way to say, how are people feeling about what's going to happen?
[00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:51.639]  They're betting with their dollar.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.500]  And it's looking very good.
[00:43:54.619 --> 00:43:58.239]  And I'm comparing the margins of the states that Trump...
[00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:04.000]  He might be losing certain states now, but the question is, by what compared to 2020?
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.280]  And he might be winning Florida now, because I think they won Florida back in 2020.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.380]  But by what?
[00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:11.440]  And the margins are swinging radically.
[00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:21.230]  And You know, Miami going red, or at least having a double-digit shift since 2020, is an indication not just of Florida, Miami, whatever.
[00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.670]  It's an indication of the Latino vote.
[00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:29.869]  And from what I've been explained by people who are smarter than me, the Latino vote, excluding California, but across America.
[00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.449]  And it's wild.
[00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.510]  I mean, it's wild in real time.
[00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:39.409]  And we haven't yet gotten to the Pennsylvania, to certain other swing states.
[00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:44.889]  But what we're seeing from the East is going to be indicative of what's coming as you progress West.
[00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:46.579]  Except for California.
[00:44:46.579 --> 00:44:50.619]  But it's looking very good, and I don't want to get ahead of anything, but it's looking good.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.900]  Yeah, we're going to pull it up.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.880]  I was just looking at it.
[00:44:53.039 --> 00:44:58.599]  He's going way up in projections from the mid-60s to the 70s, and Polymarket is dead on.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:11.199]  So Polymarket now projecting Trump victory, and it may be so big that even if they try to hold Georgia or Pennsylvania or California, Or Nevada or Arizona out.
[00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:12.920]  It could be so big, that doesn't matter.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:20.719]  It looks like the Roger Stone prediction, he said it was a good possibility, trending towards it Sunday, that Trump would win tonight.
[00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:23.530]  Yeah, and not just that.
[00:45:23.949 --> 00:45:25.170]  It's a game of politics.
[00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:26.250]  We all understand this.
[00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:28.869]  It's a game of politics, what they can get away with pushing the limits.
[00:45:28.969 --> 00:45:34.869]  If it's so decisive east to west, they won't even try to say, well, we need another two weeks.
[00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.210]  No.
[00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:42.610]  First of all, there's no civilized country in the world where it takes a week, two weeks, or in California's case, 30 days.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.260]  To get the final tally.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.840]  It's the day of you.
[00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:46.420]  Count them.
[00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:50.940]  And if you can't count them by the morning, you have failed, and that's not to be accepted.
[00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:56.719]  In Maricopa County, I forget the guy's name coming out and saying, we might not know for two weeks, and that's normal.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.199]  No, it's not normal.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.000]  What it is, is politic.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.639]  And if the social permission slip for them to do this is no longer there, they're not going to do it.
[00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:10.369]  And so if it's decisive enough coming east to west, they're not going to try to screw around.
[00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.769]  And you'll quickly see them say, oh, look, we got our results in within a day or two.
[00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.349]  They cannot be allowed to go on for two weeks.
[00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:25.550]  And this should be decisive enough that they will not even think they have the authority or the authorization or the political tolerance to do it.
[00:46:26.699 --> 00:46:27.619]  That's what it looks like.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.880]  And by the way, to interrupt you, you're totally dead on.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.539]  And I'm glad you mentioned polymarket.
[00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:32.800]  That's way more accurate than all the polls.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.780]  But Rasmussen is the most accurate polling agency.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.900]  We had the director rub it on a few days ago.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.860]  By the way, he said he'd come on tonight.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.719]  Let's get him on too.
[00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:42.000]  That he was predicting a big truck victory.
[00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:43.679]  You talk about a sexy graph.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.820]  I mean, I don't normally look at lines and just get excited.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.340]  Let's put that Marilyn Monroe back up there on screen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.599]  Sexy lines.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.519]  Let's put that polymarket graph we had right back up there.
[00:46:55.929 --> 00:47:02.309]  Ladies and gentlemen, because that just shows Trump shooting straight up with a giant margin of victory.
[00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.670]  Holy Toledo!
[00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.329]  She's going straight down, he's going straight up.
[00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:06.809]  Woo!
[00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:08.289]  Yeah, baby!
[00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:14.000]  My father always said, reality catches up with you.
[00:47:14.139 --> 00:47:18.039]  And there have been delusions that have been entertained for weeks now.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.519]  For anybody who can't see the ground, it looks like...
[00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:23.900]  It looks good.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.719]  Skyrocketing and cliff jumping.
[00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:28.219]  But the bottom line, reality...
[00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:29.579]  I was trying to think of a thing.
[00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:35.340]  He's going like an Elon Musk rocket and she's cliff diving without a parachute.
[00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:47.190]  And the amazing thing is, may it be decisive enough that these people in certain swing states don't even – they recognize they no longer have the political cover to screw around.
[00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:57.969]  The games are over, and we know what they did in 2022 – in 2020, sorry, because we – A, we lived through it, and B, it's becoming apparent now, and it will become more apparent as time progresses.
[00:47:58.519 --> 00:48:05.539]  This is going to be sufficiently decisive that no one's going to be able to say, oh, we've got to go pull out a few bags here and there.
[00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:14.440]  The graph you showed earlier today when I was on with Trump's hair, and it's his hair and the Biden trying to catch up with it, and it's not going to happen this time.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.340]  Touch wood.
[00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:22.019]  He just tweeted, must predict it would be 69.9.
[00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:25.380]  But it's actually, you know, the prophecy, it's worse than that.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.539]  It's now in the mid-70s.
[00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.150]  Yeah, guys, pull that up.
[00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.269]  I showed it a bunch today.
[00:48:29.889 --> 00:48:31.809]  Trump's hair, I've got an overhead shot, overhead shot.
[00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:38.050]  And I'm telling them to make this a t-shirt, but that's what, they hope to get past the red, but that's how it's actually ending up.
[00:48:40.369 --> 00:48:41.809]  Who did this?
[00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:46.090]  Like, this is someone deserves credit for that is absolute glory right there.
[00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:47.130]  Oh, what I said is glory.
[00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:50.730]  I said, this represents my 2024 election outcome predictions.
[00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:54.800]  Owen, Owen's got a wonderfully beautiful tie on.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:00.840]  I've got, if I can bring up my leg here, I've got my American flag socks and I had American flag Crocs before.
[00:49:01.239 --> 00:49:03.719]  I got American socks and American flag Crocs.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.659]  No, Owen, beautiful tie.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:12.159]  This needs to be humiliating and there needs to be no possibility that they can wake up tomorrow morning.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.880]  Do you remember Bernie Sanders saying, oh, you're going to think you're in the lead, but what's going to happen is votes are going to trickle in.
[00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:19.199]  Yeah, the red mirage.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.280]  The red mirage is going to disappear.
[00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:24.090]  They can't wake up tomorrow morning and say that.
[00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:26.389]  And if they do, nobody's gonna believe them.
[00:49:26.489 --> 00:49:27.269]  That's what this has to be.
[00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:28.449]  That's what this is looking like.
[00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.210]  You said that months ago on my show.
[00:49:30.269 --> 00:49:31.329]  You said it's gotta be decisive.
[00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:32.989]  It's gotta be decisive.
[00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.710]  And it's looking decisive.
[00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:39.090]  And you look at Miami going, if not red, double-digit shifts from 2020.
[00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:40.929]  No one's gonna believe.
[00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:48.590]  We counted the votes and it looks like he just squeaked into their 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania.
[00:49:48.849 --> 00:49:49.809]  No one's gonna believe it.
[00:49:49.929 --> 00:49:52.829]  And so this is too big to steal, beat to cheat.
[00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:53.889]  What's the other one there?
[00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.489]  Too big to rig.
[00:49:54.489 --> 00:49:55.210]  Too big to rig.
[00:49:56.009 --> 00:50:06.090]  But we might be witnessing this in real time, and God willing, it'll be an early night, and people are going to have to shut up, eat crow, and play by a team.
[00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:16.030]  I don't want to jinx it, but just in case, guys, my wallet is right when you walk in my office to the left, sitting on the counter, sitting on the cabinet.
[00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:17.809]  Get some cash.
[00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:21.960]  Get to the liquor store before it closes and get us some Dom Perignon here.
[00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:23.119]  Go!
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:23.920]  Get it out.
[00:50:26.739 --> 00:50:36.420]  Understand, like, what we could witness tonight could be the most, I had the vision also when I'm biking, the most unifying presidential acceptance speech ever.
[00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:37.699]  We've had our differences.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.219]  It's time to unify as a country.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:44.360]  Trump can say, I'm going to go after the people who broke the law, unless Biden pardons them.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.860]  And Biden might be, you know, rushing to pardon and then resigning.
[00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:51.110]  If they're pardoned, I can't go after them.
[00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.550]  If they stay there, we will go after those who broke the law.
[00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:54.949]  But it's time to unify as a country.
[00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.349]  And this is the moment where I will represent all of you.
[00:50:58.489 --> 00:50:59.869]  I'm not like Kamala Harris.
[00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:00.889]  I don't call you Nazis.
[00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.510]  I don't call you Nazi adjacent.
[00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:05.809]  I will represent you even though you didn't vote for me.
[00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:10.070]  But I will go after the people who tried to lock me up, bankrupt me, and kill me.
[00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:14.050]  And if you're one of those people, you better pray to God that you get a pardon from Joe Biden.
[00:51:14.269 --> 00:51:15.849]  Because if you don't, I'll go after you.
[00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:17.469]  If you don't resign, I'll go after you.
[00:51:17.659 --> 00:51:23.980]  But it could be the most unifying speech in American history tonight and reset the trajectory of America.
[00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:25.420]  It's amazing what we're witnessing.
[00:51:25.679 --> 00:51:27.039]  Well, I mean, this is about survival.
[00:51:27.199 --> 00:51:37.440]  I've watched them put all these people in prison, persecute all these people, attack my family, smuggle 325,000 kids they admit and disappear them into slave labor and sex slavery, Senate report.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.219]  I mean, this is cathartic if it's happening.
[00:51:43.199 --> 00:51:46.039]  I want to get Candace Horbach's take on this.
[00:52:12.019 --> 00:52:13.039]  I'll tell you.
[00:52:13.239 --> 00:52:13.760]  Ha ha ha!
[00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.269]  Oh boy, I'm feeling good right now.
[00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:20.809]  70 Sam's back, folks.
[00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.789]  Woo!
[00:52:22.469 --> 00:52:23.409]  Not yet, though.
[00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:25.510]  Look at this.
[00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.070]  I'm just refreshing it.
[00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.969]  I mean, Fox News hasn't called Arizona yet, so that's a good sign.
[00:52:32.469 --> 00:52:33.489]  The thing is this.
[00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:39.849]  The indicators were there, and I had this discussion with my wife where everybody lives in their own silos, but not all silos are equal.
[00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.059]  And so you go to Instagram and people are saying, Oh, yeah.
[00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:44.840]  I'm all gung ho on Kamala Harris.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.000]  You got Michael Cohen out there tweeting out a gravestone with a MAGA hat on it.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.639]  That mother effer can't go to hell fast enough.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.380]  But set that aside.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.280]  Not all silos are equal.
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.940]  And there's data driven silos.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.480]  And then there's propaganda driven silos.
[00:52:58.719 --> 00:53:10.639]  And we might be witnessing a real collision of realities here where the people have been sitting there saying, You know, the people who told them that Biden was good for another four years are now eating crow.
[00:53:11.039 --> 00:53:13.599]  And people are going to have to realize they've been lied to.
[00:53:13.699 --> 00:53:17.840]  And may there be a second awakening of those who have had the wool pulled over their eyes.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.840]  And as long as they're not a globalist, we'll welcome him in.
[00:53:20.099 --> 00:53:22.900]  Look, I told Zuckerberg on air, and I was behind the scenes, I'll leave it at that.
[00:53:23.019 --> 00:53:24.360]  I said, you better flip and apologize.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.219]  And he literally did it two months later.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.559]  And I mean, you know, they need to get out of the way.
[00:53:30.449 --> 00:53:35.510]  Well, he did it two months later, but then he also went back into censoring and suppressing stories that were- I don't trust him.
[00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:40.969]  My point is that we're trying to give him a chance.
[00:53:45.009 --> 00:53:45.449]  Absolutely.
[00:53:45.769 --> 00:53:58.130]  And as we're seeing with Jeff Bezos of the Washington Post, I've been saying it for years, but the only problem is when you make predictions over a long enough period of time, eventually, you know, reasonable predictions might come true on a short enough period of time.
[00:53:58.349 --> 00:54:01.349]  But like I said, eventually, free speech is going to be cool again.
[00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:06.449]  Eventually, YouTube might operate by market economics and not politics.
[00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.960]  And so over the long enough course of time, Free speech will win out.
[00:54:11.079 --> 00:54:14.679]  And we're seeing it with, at the very least, temporarily, the Washington Post.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.639]  You get Bezos not endorsing Kamala Harris.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:24.440]  You get an uproar, upheaval, whatever, uprising within the WAPO. You get the lefty hacks leaving.
[00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:27.920]  And then you say, well, we need to hire more conservatives because they need to make money.
[00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:34.360]  The bottom line is you can only thrive off political narratives for so long before you realize, oh, well, shit, I need to feed people.
[00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:37.300]  And so Bezos is having that realization in real time.
[00:54:37.579 --> 00:54:38.780]  So will Zuckerberg.
[00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:39.980]  They're going to find out.
[00:54:40.519 --> 00:54:43.000]  The tides, they change.
[00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:47.500]  And you're not going to be able to get away with what you were getting away with forever when they shift.
[00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:51.840]  The pendulum is swinging back, and now they've got to make their bucks to pay for their stuff.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.980]  Otherwise, Zuckerberg's no longer a billionaire.
[00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:55.610]  Viva Frye, stay there.
[00:54:55.869 --> 00:54:56.949]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:57.949]  A bunch of others.
[00:54:58.409 --> 00:55:02.929]  But I want you to hear this from Owen and Harrison Smith, who are on the numbers.
[00:55:03.469 --> 00:55:05.690]  Can they still win?
[00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:08.849]  Okay, I don't want to celebrate earlier, but it's looking really good.
[00:55:08.949 --> 00:55:10.050]  The Republicans have taken the Senate.
[00:55:10.889 --> 00:55:14.050]  Looks like they're adding houses, seats to the House.
[00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:16.110]  This is just amazing.
[00:55:16.389 --> 00:55:17.329]  But we'll see.
[00:55:18.329 --> 00:55:20.889]  My gut told me, landslide too big to rig.
[00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.170]  Oh, and quantify this and what's happened in the last 15 minutes?
[00:55:24.269 --> 00:55:25.090]  We were talking to Viva Frye.
[00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:30.050]  Okay, I think it's pretty safe to say the Republicans are gonna take the Senate.
[00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:33.610]  They have not declared Moreno the winner in Ohio yet.
[00:55:33.909 --> 00:55:37.909]  But for all intents and purposes, I won't call it.
[00:55:38.269 --> 00:55:47.610]  But with the victory in West Virginia and the victory I'm anticipating in Ohio, I do believe the Republicans will take the Senate and they'll declare that within the hour.
[00:55:47.869 --> 00:55:51.469]  And then there's other races that will be- Don't worry, I've already declared it, so it's okay, go ahead.
[00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:53.269]  It might give them a bigger advantage.
[00:55:53.429 --> 00:55:55.449]  Now, here's what we're seeing right now.
[00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.630]  Let's look at Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.
[00:55:57.909 --> 00:56:02.730]  Because if Trump wins these three states, that's the easiest path to victory.
[00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.650]  He doesn't have to win any of these three states.
[00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.150]  All he needs at that point is Nevada.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.699]  The numbers in Georgia are good, okay?
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.699]  The numbers in Georgia are good.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:20.900]  I don't think there's enough votes left in DeKalb County or Fulton County to flip Georgia.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.099]  I think the rural vote in Georgia is gonna be enough.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:29.079]  So I don't know how they don't call Georgia.
[00:56:29.239 --> 00:56:32.820]  I really don't know how they don't call Georgia tonight at this rate.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:42.340]  I don't think Harris can get enough votes in Fulton County Or in DeKalb County to flip Georgia.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.539]  Guys, if you go back down here.
[00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:45.800]  Oh, by the way, you know.
[00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:49.280]  Bolton is here and then DeKalb is right over here.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:57.039]  You know, about five counties in Georgia have extended their polling places for several hours because of bomb threats.
[00:56:57.219 --> 00:56:59.960]  So maybe that's why they're not calling it quite yet because of that.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:04.639]  In fact, I was about to say the new broken water main that the later minute didn't happen, the new thing is a bomb threat.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.000]  And then you blame it on the Russians.
[00:57:06.909 --> 00:57:09.610]  So anyway, my point is, I think, I don't know.
[00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:16.050]  I don't know how they can, the numbers are in favor of Trump right now, unless they do a 300,000.
[00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:17.590]  Because here's what they did, Alex.
[00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:23.750]  Instead of doing 300,000 votes for Biden at 3.30 in the morning, they did it before the election this time.
[00:57:23.909 --> 00:57:27.949]  They stuffed the votes into the ballot with early voting and mail-in voting.
[00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:31.750]  So now, if we're up at the night, I don't think they can do it.
[00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:34.110]  I really like what I'm seeing in Georgia.
[00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:35.750]  I'm obviously not gonna call it.
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.739]  But I don't know.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.099]  This thing is going to be tight.
[00:57:39.099 --> 00:57:41.639]  It looks like we've already overridden the fraud, which they pre-packed.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.679]  It's going to be tight.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.619]  Don't get me wrong.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.320]  They're still going to get a big gain in Fulton and DeKalb County.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.159]  I just don't think it's going to be enough to overwhelm the state.
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:50.860]  I really don't.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.239]  Now, let's zoom back out and go to North Carolina.
[00:57:53.849 --> 00:57:56.610]  Again, I really like what I'm seeing in North Carolina.
[00:57:56.849 --> 00:58:01.510]  I actually anticipate North Carolina will be the next state that will be called for Donald Trump.
[00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:05.909]  The numbers continue to go into his favor, not calling it yet.
[00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:11.550]  But I think if there's gonna be another state called for Donald Trump, of consequence, it will be North Carolina.
[00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:15.869]  We still have a lot of these red counties where we're not even getting any returns yet.
[00:58:16.429 --> 00:58:18.489]  But I like what I'm seeing in North Carolina.
[00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.750]  Now, Virginia is curious, I have to say.
[00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:27.510]  The NBC News Desk called Virginia for Kamala Harris about 30 minutes ago.
[00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:30.230]  I'm calling bullshit, okay?
[00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:35.530]  When I look at Virginia, you're looking at Alexandria, you're looking up here in Northern Virginia.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.659]  You're looking at Roanoke, but really I think what they're looking at is Richmond, where the returns are still low right now.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.039]  Go to Richmond right here guys.
[00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:46.320]  Now these returns are still low.
[00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:52.179]  Kamala Harris is gonna get probably another 70,000 or so votes in Richmond.
[00:58:53.519 --> 00:58:58.260]  But when you look at the larger numbers, I mean, there's a lot of votes coming in.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.039]  I don't think Virginia is done.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.699]  I don't think Virginia is out of play yet.
[00:59:03.199 --> 00:59:15.699]  Certainly, when you look at the early returns that still are due in Richmond, and she's going to still continue to gain in Northern Virginia, though these returns are really heavily in already, I'd say Virginia's still in play.
[00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:18.070]  I say Virginia is still in play.
[00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:21.969]  I don't know why some of these news sources have called Virginia for Harris.
[00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.630]  I think it's still in play.
[00:59:23.849 --> 00:59:26.710]  Yes, she has the advantage with these major cities.
[00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:33.190]  I think Virginia's still in play, especially with Trump up right now more than 20,000.
[00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:37.230]  A small margin that they're certainly gonna make up in these big cities.
[00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:39.309]  I think Virginia's still in play.
[00:59:39.449 --> 00:59:52.789]  And this is key because if Trump wins Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, Now, I mean, all he has to do is basically win one more of these battleground states, and they'll have to call it.
[00:59:52.949 --> 00:59:54.809]  They'll have no other choice but to call it.
[00:59:54.949 --> 00:59:58.230]  So we're looking at North Carolina and Georgia.
[00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:07.889]  Those states are gonna be the next ones that, I mean, unless we see some major trend change, one of those is gonna be called for Trump.
[01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:10.050]  We'll continue to monitor Virginia.
[01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:13.630]  It's still too early, I'd say, in Michigan and Wisconsin to say anything.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:22.340]  I don't like what I'm seeing in Pennsylvania, but the late surge could help Donald Trump with the people that stuck around to the extended voting.
[01:00:23.739 --> 01:00:26.199]  But the early numbers don't look so good there.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.920]  So we're keeping an eye on Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.
[01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:36.429]  But specifically, can Kamala Harris make up the deficit in Atlanta?
[01:00:36.809 --> 01:00:42.630]  Can Kamala Harris make up the deficit in the big blue cities in Virginia?
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:46.110]  I do think they call North Carolina for Trump tonight, though.
[01:00:46.469 --> 01:00:49.170]  And this is gonna be interesting, Alex.
[01:00:49.329 --> 01:00:55.170]  This is gonna be interesting because now all of a sudden, whatever happens in these three states could be inconsequential.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.780]  If Donald Trump pulls off Nevada.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.800]  Now Trump was pulling the best in Arizona.
[01:01:00.059 --> 01:01:02.900]  He was pulling the best in Arizona of all of these states.
[01:01:03.179 --> 01:01:05.340]  Now you never know what's gonna happen in Maricopa County.
[01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:12.480]  Trump's path to victory becomes clearer, especially if Georgia and North Carolina get declared for Trump.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.159]  The path to victory for Trump becomes much clearer.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.079]  But again, the Republicans have We have taken the Senate.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.840]  I believe they'll announce that Moreno takes the Senate race in Ohio.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.900]  Are they saying Texas went there?
[01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:27.579]  I see that.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.440]  Texas is confirmed Republican.
[01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.559]  Yeah, we went red.
[01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:32.619]  Ohio has been called as well.
[01:01:32.719 --> 01:01:34.420]  Yes, we can breathe easy about Texas.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.179]  What about Ted Cruz, though?
[01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:38.760]  Just like 30 minutes ago, they were saying it was still close.
[01:01:39.079 --> 01:01:44.260]  No, he's at, well, a little bit, I'm getting different information here, but he's got over 50% of the vote.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.920]  He's, I saw some places saying he had 66%, so I don't know if we have new numbers here.
[01:01:49.199 --> 01:01:52.760]  Yeah, 66% is what some people are saying.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.420]  Serious endorphin dumps.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.340]  I mean, my God, this is cathartic.
[01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:58.119]  I'm going to come right back to you guys.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.780]  You were hearing about your state, North Carolina, Candace Horbach.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.380]  What do you make of that?
[01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:03.289]  I'm really hopeful.
[01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:04.250]  I'm really hopeful.
[01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.510]  I think it's going to go red.
[01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.489]  I totally agree.
[01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:09.550]  I think we will all be able to rest easy.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:14.630]  I really hope everyone has an answer tonight, because I do think it's really dangerous the longer we go on.
[01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:22.130]  People deserve to have certainty, and the longer it goes on, the more unrest there's going to be, the more divisiveness there's going to be, and it's obviously all intentional.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:30.780]  And also with all of these random coincidental bomb threats, I really hope that those get investigated later because how is that not election interference?
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.679]  Like just coincidentally in like these flip states, just you know.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:43.280]  Oh, and all of those that get caught on camera flipping, it's always Republican to Democrat and all the key Republican districts have the power go out in states all over.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.980]  Oh, it's all accidental, Viva Frye.
[01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.099]  Yeah, nothing to see.
[01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:55.440]  But they know that it's coming from Russia, even though the DVOS attacks came from basically every other country than Russia, but somehow it's still tied to Russia.
[01:02:55.719 --> 01:03:10.480]  And Ratfaceberger, who definitively knows it came from Russia, they didn't think to put in a caption, like a bot detector, when they have their online absentee ballots voting before on October 14.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.719]  It's so preposterous.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.699]  By the way, the FBI came out and said it's not true.
[01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.730]  Well, I didn't hear that.
[01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:17.690]  What did they say was not true?
[01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:19.269]  No, they said it's not credible, no evidence.
[01:03:19.389 --> 01:03:22.769]  All the power went off at the voting station in Arizona.
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.909]  Russians, I ate too much food.
[01:03:24.909 --> 01:03:26.130]  I'm fat, the Russians.
[01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.210]  It's so pathological.
[01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:39.150]  You genuinely appreciate the degree to which Raffensperger is a uniparty Oh, he's a swamp lord, 100%.
[01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.730]  I'm trying to weigh my words.
[01:03:40.969 --> 01:03:42.829]  But like, he says, oh yeah, it's the Russians.
[01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:44.190]  We're incompetent.
[01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:47.510]  We don't even put in a CAPTCHA for online absentee ballot voting.
[01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:51.050]  We've got two bomb threats from Russia that we need to treat as credible.
[01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:55.369]  We know it's Russia, and Russia's not our friend, so he can take a jab at Donald Trump.
[01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:59.710]  Ratfaceburger has earned his name as Ratfaceburger because that's what he is.
[01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:02.150]  But the bottom line, you know, Owen Shore is talking about it.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:08.659]  They don't have the tools anymore that they had in 2020 to pull off what they would need to pull off to change this overnight.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.820]  They don't have the tools, and they certainly don't have the media cover.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.739]  Well, brother, check back in with us over the night.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.019]  You're doing your own coverage and a lot of other hits on shows.
[01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:18.980]  I don't know how late you're staying up.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.099]  We'll be up here very late tonight.
[01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:20.840]  You are welcome here.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.300]  We love you.
[01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:24.000]  How do people find your great broadcasts and work, Viva Frye?
[01:04:24.559 --> 01:04:26.139]  Viva Fry on everywhere.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:31.800]  Just look up Viva Fry on Rumble and VivaBarnesLaw.locals.com for the best above average community out there.
[01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:34.460]  How's your co-host?
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.940]  You know I just love Robert Barnes.
[01:04:37.059 --> 01:04:40.659]  He's been my lawyer for a long time and a great historian.
[01:04:40.679 --> 01:04:41.980]  I heard his back went out today.
[01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:42.639]  That's not good.
[01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:46.050]  Is he doing okay?
[01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.690]  He's doing okay so long as it's only a back.
[01:04:50.989 --> 01:04:51.670]  I'm neurotic.
[01:04:51.769 --> 01:04:53.869]  Make sure you don't have any internal bleeding and whatever.
[01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:59.230]  It's a back and it's a spasm and he's lying on his back so I don't think he wants to do the Cardi B podcast tonight.
[01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:03.510]  He's resting up but what a night to have that happen.
[01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:04.630]  He's alive and he's well.
[01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:07.269]  As far as I know, I'll check on him right now.
[01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:08.769]  You know what?
[01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:10.610]  Get his ass on the phone.
[01:05:10.769 --> 01:05:12.650]  We gotta hear Robert Barnes on election night.
[01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:17.750]  No, like, I wanna see him on a couch, doing like a Barnes analysis, lying on his back.
[01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:22.949]  It's very painful, but he was supposed to be on Barris, Richard Barris, who's live now as well.
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.409]  But no, he's fine.
[01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:28.650]  I really think he's in a lot of pain, and Barnes is relatively stoic.
[01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:32.269]  So if he's complaining, it's not like Viva complaining about a sore knee.
[01:05:32.369 --> 01:05:39.230]  But he's good, touch wood, and may, you know, The joy might overwhelm the pain, hopefully.
[01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:39.869]  All right, brother.
[01:05:39.989 --> 01:05:40.150]  Thank you.
[01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:40.769]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.050]  Thank you very much.
[01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:44.130]  Candice, you were getting cut off.
[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.050]  Make your points.
[01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.570]  No, no.
[01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.869]  I think that this is all amazing.
[01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:56.710]  I'm really curious how much the Joe Rogan endorsement made a dent in a lot of these states that we're all concerned about, like the battleground states.
[01:05:58.239 --> 01:05:59.079]  I don't know.
[01:05:59.179 --> 01:06:00.019]  I'm on the edge of my seat.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:07.940]  I mean, I think in fairness, I think the earlier interviews and Joe acting like he was nonpartisan, devastating Harris and Biden for years.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.940]  I mean, not inside baseball, but I mean, the Democrats knew it.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.239]  I mean, he was doing that so it would be more effective to hurt them.
[01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:16.469]  Once he actually did it.
[01:06:16.469 --> 01:06:16.889]  Give him a little insight.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.349]  Yeah, I mean, they know it so I can say it.
[01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:19.110]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.889 --> 01:06:21.449]  She chose as hardcore as I am.
[01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.690]  I mean, probably more.
[01:06:22.809 --> 01:06:24.769]  I mean, it's like dinner with a show, see it.
[01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:26.030]  But he knows everything.
[01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.570]  But the point is, is that it was already done.
[01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:32.090]  That was a victory lap, unless they steal it.
[01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:33.789]  And Musk and all of it.
[01:06:33.849 --> 01:06:37.969]  I mean, I said to everybody three and a half, four years ago, I said, watch, Musk is going to go public.
[01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.849]  And so is Rogan, because I'm around here.
[01:06:40.889 --> 01:06:41.510]  I know a few things.
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.750]  But they've got their way of doing it.
[01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:46.789]  I've got my way, because I'm kind of like 30 years ago getting it started.
[01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:49.170]  And then these guys come in with heavy guns.
[01:06:49.369 --> 01:06:51.949]  But people don't want World War III and the end of prosperity.
[01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:53.230]  And that's what Musk has said.
[01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.429]  He said he went to the World Government Forum last year and said, world government sucks.
[01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:57.230]  You're going to kill us all.
[01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:02.010]  And he came out yesterday and said, we must stop the globalists, one world government, unelected, one world government.
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:03.489]  We must get out of the UN, basically.
[01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:04.429]  Which is true.
[01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:06.570]  I mean, this is a world corporate tyranny.
[01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:11.730]  Yeah, but I still think people underestimate how much women love abortions.
[01:07:11.909 --> 01:07:18.110]  So I'm concerned that's still going to be a huge voting point for a lot of people.
[01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:19.269]  We'll see what happens.
[01:07:19.389 --> 01:07:21.349]  Again, everyone's trying to go after the young male vote.
[01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:25.449]  So hopefully men are going out and they're voting and it's going to kind of overtake.
[01:07:25.679 --> 01:07:26.420]  That demographic.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:33.420]  And then also, how much of this crying wolf, what it's really crying Russia, are people gonna continue to believe?
[01:07:33.559 --> 01:07:35.579]  But that's the thing that I'm also confused about.
[01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:36.820]  It's Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[01:07:37.059 --> 01:07:40.599]  And at what point, maybe it's not, or maybe try to use a different boogeyman.
[01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:42.800]  Yeah, well, Hillary, I agree with you.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.099]  Hillary tried the gender thing, and it didn't work.
[01:07:46.579 --> 01:07:51.579]  And then, I mean, I think now, There's a lot of manipulation of polls.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.619]  And there are definitely some women out there that are wedded to the government and the system and believe everything they're told.
[01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:00.739]  But a lot of the women I know that have been liberals in the past, they're like, listen, I just want to survive.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.039]  I want my money to be able to buy something.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.719]  And I think that's going to override it.
[01:08:05.059 --> 01:08:05.179]  Right.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:11.179]  The state of inflation and people not being able to pay groceries and not be feeling safe when you drop off your kid at school.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.940]  Yeah, I would hope that those are more pressing issues.
[01:08:13.239 --> 01:08:13.519]  Absolutely.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.100]  What are you seeing with the women?
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.020]  Because you travel the country on your own shows everywhere.
[01:08:18.159 --> 01:08:18.619]  You talk to a lot of folks.
[01:08:18.739 --> 01:08:22.159]  I mean, do you think women are really that obsessed with it?
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.319]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:25.659]  I think that it's underplayed.
[01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:29.119]  I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it because it's still such a charged issue.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:34.819]  But for some reason, people do think that Kamala is going to somehow reinstitute Roe versus Wade and that they're going to have this right.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.539]  And to me, again, it's such a weird thing to obsess over and try to fight for, especially if you're an older woman.
[01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:44.180]  It's like you're wanting the right to kill your grandchild.
[01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:45.350]  I don't know.
[01:08:45.489 --> 01:08:47.649]  Again, World War III is way more pressing to me.
[01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:49.949]  Being able to put food on the table is more pressing to me.
[01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.109]  Saving your kid from poisoned food is more pressing to me.
[01:08:53.149 --> 01:09:02.569]  So I'm hoping that, I don't know, maybe there's gonna be that shy voter that everyone's talking about and that these women just don't want to get involved in these heavy conversations and they're gonna just show up in the polls.
[01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:03.489]  Well, exactly.
[01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.310]  And here's the deal.
[01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.270]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:08.989]  And people say, why the hell do you admit that?
[01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:10.270]  And the left goes, look, he's a hypocrite.
[01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:10.789]  He admits it.
[01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:14.090]  I have paid for abortions when I was younger and wasn't really thinking about it.
[01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.729]  And God's forgiven me.
[01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.390]  I'm not going to judge people that have done it if they weren't doing it as a sacrament and enjoying it or anything.
[01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:24.350]  But it has become a sacrament with the left, and it should not be the form of birth control.
[01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:25.630]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.579]  No, I forgot who said it, but it's rare, safe, and legal, right?
[01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:32.920]  And that's what it was supposed to be.
[01:09:33.079 --> 01:09:44.819]  And now you have these women that are saying, I've had 27, and they're celebrating it, or they'll have a birthday cake, or you'll have the DNC where they have that pop-up tent or trailer, which is, to me, the most reckless thing you can- Human sacrificing.
[01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:58.310]  If you have someone who's coming in to watch a convention and then the spontaneous decision to go do that, and then is there any aftercare for that woman after, like mental health care and checking up and making sure that she's consciously consenting to a major medical procedure?
[01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.390]  It's like a carnival atmosphere.
[01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.270]  Yeah, it's anti-human.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.539]  It is anti-natalist, anti-human, anti-woman, anti-man, and it's degrading life.
[01:10:08.779 --> 01:10:12.000]  That's what's backfired on them, is it's the celebration of it.
[01:10:14.899 --> 01:10:15.659]  You're not kidding.
[01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:16.899]  I can't even watch these videos.
[01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.340]  I mean, when I first heard about it, like...
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:33.159]  20 years ago, I saw news articles about women that like to get them, and then I saw, like, TV shows where they're getting them on TV. Oh, God, I just, and they talk to their boyfriend, I can't wait to get pregnant and kill it again, and then they write their, yeah, little bastards conceived here, dead there.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:33.859]  Have you seen that stuff?
[01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:34.100]  No.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.760]  And they give it birthday cakes.
[01:10:36.079 --> 01:10:36.899]  I've seen the cakes.
[01:10:37.119 --> 01:10:38.579]  I mean, this is real.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.579]  I thought it was fake.
[01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:40.060]  No.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.819]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:42.739]  Right.
[01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:50.520]  So again, it just goes to voting for who is pro- Imagine climbing in a trailer at the DNC in Chicago and getting an abortion.
[01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:51.640]  I mean, this is gross.
[01:10:52.439 --> 01:10:54.060]  Yeah, it's really sickening.
[01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:59.819]  And then most women that I know that have had to go through that procedure, it's devastating, right?
[01:10:59.859 --> 01:11:01.340]  It's not something to be celebrated.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.079]  It's not something that you're putting on a cake.
[01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:05.960]  It's certainly not something that you should make an impromptu decision.
[01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:07.859]  And they take you in the back of the trailer.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:08.300]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.670]  And I mean, I don't want to get gravity here.
[01:11:10.829 --> 01:11:12.010]  They shove a vacuum cleaner.
[01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:13.170]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:11:13.449 --> 01:11:14.210]  And just send you on your way.
[01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.090]  And then there's a ton of complications that can come with that as well.
[01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:18.529]  But no, go enjoy your convention.
[01:11:20.449 --> 01:11:21.510]  That's what you're fighting for.
[01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:22.510]  That's crazy to me.
[01:11:22.689 --> 01:11:24.149]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:26.390]  I can't even look at it.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.260]  Oh, and then Kamala, remember people talked about Jesus?
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.279]  She goes, you're in the wrong place.
[01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:32.859]  Get out of here.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.520]  And then she had on that one girl from Superstar.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.859]  I don't know if you ever watched that movie back in the 90s or early 2000s.
[01:11:39.899 --> 01:11:45.300]  It was that Catholic nerdy girl, and she did a talent show or something like that.
[01:11:45.359 --> 01:11:52.380]  But she had her come on, and they did this interview together, and she was saying how the Catholics were then going to vote for her because she was trying to save face after that comment.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.079]  That's not going to work.
[01:11:54.199 --> 01:11:56.220]  That's absolutely not going to work for anyone that has a mind.
[01:11:56.609 --> 01:12:04.189]  Well, I'm thinking here that if Trump does win, which is looking good, we better start wargaming what they're going to pull.
[01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:05.449]  And I got a really good idea.
[01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.310]  I mean, that's what we do here.
[01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:11.630]  But it's just insane because the power is not in the media, the old media anymore.
[01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.930]  And people are wise to their scams now.
[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.869]  Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, what's the latest on the numbers?
[01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:23.149]  Then give me your take on what we should brace for if we get the Trump win as early as tonight.
[01:12:23.829 --> 01:12:29.430]  Well, as we predicted, North Carolina, many outlets are calling North Carolina for Trump.
[01:12:29.529 --> 01:12:33.109]  So I think it's fair to say, in fact, Trump has called North Carolina for himself.
[01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.550]  So North Carolina has gone for Trump.
[01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.050]  Look, I'm looking at the numbers in Georgia now.
[01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.869]  I don't see how Harris comes back.
[01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:42.970]  I gotta be honest.
[01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:45.369]  I don't see how Harris comes back in Georgia.
[01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:53.149]  I mean, it'd have to be astronomical numbers in Fulton and DeKalb County for her to come back in Georgia.
[01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:54.890]  So I guess it's not out of the picture.
[01:12:55.569 --> 01:12:57.609]  But I still like what I'm seeing in Georgia.
[01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:59.390]  I don't understand.
[01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.630]  I mean, I'm looking at Virginia.
[01:13:02.789 --> 01:13:04.250]  Trump is still ahead.
[01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:11.069]  And so I guess they're just assuming all of these big blue cities are going to overwhelm the deficit.
[01:13:11.289 --> 01:13:15.649]  I mean, it's a small margin that Trump has, about 20,000.
[01:13:16.409 --> 01:13:20.970]  I mean, they're going to pick up probably 70,000 votes still in Richmond.
[01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:26.949]  They're going to pick up probably another 40,000 votes, 50 maybe, in these counties.
[01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:27.670]  But there's...
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.399]  Those numbers are still going to be coming in for Trump in the counties.
[01:13:32.779 --> 01:13:33.859]  So I don't know.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.500]  Calling Virginia for Harris here seems a little aggressive to me.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.600]  I will admit it looks like she probably is leaning in her direction, I would say, with what we see.
[01:13:43.739 --> 01:13:50.020]  Well, this wouldn't be the first time liberal media outlets falsely called wins for people and states for people.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.859]  I just don't like it.
[01:13:51.939 --> 01:13:53.640]  I think Virginia is still alive.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:57.140]  I don't want to say it's going either way.
[01:13:57.239 --> 01:14:05.039]  I mean, I'll admit that the numbers right now where we're going to see the votes still coming in would favor Harris, but I think it's a little early to call.
[01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:07.600]  Well, let me ask you about this and get back to the numbers.
[01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:17.670]  If they try to block the windows and kick everybody out and say they're not counting and then later they are counting in these battlegrounds, I mean, do you think they're going to try that again?
[01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:19.109]  No, I don't think so.
[01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:20.770]  I think that the Trump team is ready.
[01:14:20.869 --> 01:14:21.890]  They got the lawyers ready.
[01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.569]  I don't think they can pull that one, no.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.260]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:30.239]  I think Laura Trump is head of the RNC and teams of lawyers in every battleground state.
[01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:33.220]  I don't think they're going to risk trying that again.
[01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:34.039]  I mean, who knows?
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:34.939]  These people are desperate.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.020]  They might do anything.
[01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:38.340]  If I was them, I wouldn't try it.
[01:14:38.399 --> 01:14:39.180]  I wouldn't advise it.
[01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:44.020]  And already, we've stopped so many attempts at counting hundreds of thousands of ballots.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.100]  The RNC has stepped in and prevented it.
[01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:52.909]  Maybe they thought they were going to be able to pull it off with all of those shenanigans pulled, but they were stopped early on.
[01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:55.489]  It's a very different game than 2020.
[01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:57.050]  And I agree about Virginia.
[01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:07.130]  I mean, I've just been watching the numbers tick in, and the differential has remained at about 50,000, and that's been the case for the last 300 or 600,000 votes that have come in.
[01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.609]  Yeah, Virginia's still very close.
[01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:12.289]  They have called it for North Carolina for Trump.
[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:13.590]  Georgia's looking very good.
[01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:19.970]  It's looking like the Senate in Ohio is going to Bernie Moreno.
[01:15:20.609 --> 01:15:22.369]  It looks like it's going in that direction.
[01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:27.069]  They haven't called that one yet, but that would be a flipped seat as well, wouldn't it?
[01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:29.869]  Flipping it from Senator Sherrod Brown.
[01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:30.210]  Yeah.
[01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:34.560]  Yeah, I don't know why they haven't called that Senate seat.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.640]  And when they do officially call it, that will officially be the Republican advantage.
[01:15:38.899 --> 01:15:43.579]  Now, I wanna highlight something here that's very important as we get later into the evening.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:49.260]  If Trump doesn't win Virginia, I'm telling you guys, this is a problem.
[01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:51.420]  I'm telling you right now, this is a problem.
[01:15:51.739 --> 01:15:56.739]  Because the numbers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin are not good.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:01.199]  Now, it's still too early in Wisconsin to really do a deep analysis.
[01:16:02.279 --> 01:16:05.939]  That might be Trump's best shot right now, but I'm gonna explain something.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:13.819]  If Trump doesn't win Virginia, and he does not win any of these states, I don't know how Trump wins.
[01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:14.859]  I'm gonna be honest.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.899]  Because even if he wins Arizona and Nevada, it's not gonna be enough.
[01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:23.659]  So if he doesn't win Virginia, he has to win one of these states.
[01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:24.760]  Has to.
[01:16:24.939 --> 01:16:27.039]  It is 100% a necessity.
[01:16:27.359 --> 01:16:31.119]  And with what I'm seeing right now, I'm a little concerned about that.
[01:16:31.579 --> 01:16:34.819]  So that might be why they want to give Virginia to Harris early.
[01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:46.739]  That might be why they're trying to throw that to Virginia to Harris early because they know that if they give it to Harris and they take this blue wall up here, Trump's path to victory all of a sudden gets blocked.
[01:16:47.359 --> 01:16:53.279]  Okay, so what are the other outlets other than one of them?
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.880]  Who all is calling Virginia for the hyena?
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.039]  It seems like the majority have.
[01:17:01.239 --> 01:17:03.659]  NBC News Desk 270 to win.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.960]  So Virginia is the new Arizona.
[01:17:08.649 --> 01:17:09.710]  Essentially, yes.
[01:17:10.109 --> 01:17:11.029]  Essentially, yes.
[01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:23.270]  And look, I understand if you do a deep dive into the numbers and the math and the analytics, it looks like there's more votes left for Harris to pick up than Trump, but it's gonna be tight.
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:27.630]  It's way too close for me to say anybody has won Virginia.
[01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:33.569]  And I still believe Based off what I'm seeing, Trump is gonna need Virginia to win.
[01:17:34.069 --> 01:17:36.909]  And I keep looking for signs in Pennsylvania.
[01:17:37.409 --> 01:17:38.930]  I'm not seeing them yet.
[01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:41.989]  I keep looking for signs in Wisconsin.
[01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.989]  It's still too early to know.
[01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:46.550]  I keep looking for signs in Michigan.
[01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.970]  You might say that's too early to know as well.
[01:17:49.829 --> 01:17:55.989]  I would say of these three now, it's gonna be a reliance on Wisconsin probably.
[01:17:56.569 --> 01:17:57.810]  But we shall see.
[01:17:57.989 --> 01:18:00.890]  Pennsylvania is a bit of a mystery because of all the late voting for Trump.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:07.640]  But I'm still sitting here focused on Virginia as we continue to get the returns in these states.
[01:18:07.859 --> 01:18:09.079]  It's too early to do a deep dive.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.239]  So how do we go from an hour ago thinking Trump's gonna win to now?
[01:18:11.279 --> 01:18:11.739]  Not sure.
[01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:12.979]  Because of Virginia.
[01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.359]  Well, look, I'm gonna be perfectly honest.
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:21.039]  Most of the people that are betting and fixing these markets probably don't follow politics that much.
[01:18:21.319 --> 01:18:22.300]  They just go.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.720]  It's kind of like sports betting.
[01:18:24.359 --> 01:18:26.920]  And the money determines who is the favorite.
[01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:32.470]  And so any dumb person can make a large bet and change the money line or change the over-under.
[01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:37.729]  Yeah, but traditionally the main aggregate of the betting is more accurate than polls.
[01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:44.770]  Perhaps, but where we're at now, we have actual raw data to look at with these results.
[01:18:44.949 --> 01:18:50.590]  So again, we're looking at a situation, if Trump doesn't win Virginia, he has to win one of these states.
[01:18:50.869 --> 01:18:51.890]  He has to.
[01:18:52.869 --> 01:18:58.670]  It's a must-have situation because it doesn't look like New Hampshire's going his way.
[01:18:59.479 --> 01:19:01.760]  He might pick up a vote in Maine.
[01:19:02.039 --> 01:19:04.439]  I assume Nebraska will flip.
[01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:05.920]  I'm not too concerned about that.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.380]  I don't anticipate Minnesota stays red.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.380]  So without Virginia, he's got to get one of these states.
[01:19:12.659 --> 01:19:17.779]  And then Arizona and Nevada are also the last chance he has to get over 270.
[01:19:18.079 --> 01:19:19.939]  So we're right on the razor, Alex.
[01:19:20.199 --> 01:19:24.159]  We are right on the razor, exactly where we anticipated we would be.
[01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:31.210]  And in Nevada, they're going to let them count unpostmarked ballots for three days after.
[01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:35.090]  That's correct, but I still like what I see in Nevada.
[01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.210]  I still think that Trump has a good shot in Nevada.
[01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.989]  Almost no one's a Democrat there.
[01:19:38.989 --> 01:19:39.770]  It's all fraud.
[01:19:41.039 --> 01:19:49.680]  Yeah, and most of the people that leave California and go to Nevada, as we know a lot of people flee California, most of them are still, they're Republicans.
[01:19:49.979 --> 01:19:54.220]  It's not like Texas, where they flee California and then vote Democrat in Texas.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.859]  The ones that flee California and move to Nevada usually vote Republican.
[01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:04.350]  I anticipate what we'll see is Trump will win Nevada, probably a small margin, not enough to flip the Senate seat there.
[01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.909]  But obviously, we don't have any of those returns.
[01:20:07.109 --> 01:20:10.409]  But it could come down to Trump needing Nevada.
[01:20:10.449 --> 01:20:14.770]  He might need Nevada, depending on what happens in these three states.
[01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:18.369]  Of those three, which one do you think he takes?
[01:20:20.609 --> 01:20:22.050]  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin?
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.680]  I think right now the numbers are best for him in Wisconsin, but really it's too early.
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.819]  I'd say it's too early to tell in these states.
[01:20:32.899 --> 01:20:34.600]  But I gotta be honest, I don't like it.
[01:20:35.479 --> 01:20:36.260]  I don't like it.
[01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:37.359]  I don't like any of those states.
[01:20:37.539 --> 01:20:39.399]  I don't like what I'm seeing in any of those states right now.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.960]  That's why I'm clinging to Virginia for my life.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:52.640]  Yeah, and those states are trending Harris right now, but I mean, the differential is so tiny, and Michigan's only at 13% reported, so I mean, that could change substantially.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:21:07.100]  Pennsylvania as well, I mean, all of these are, basically all of them are under 100,000 vote differential, and again, I'm watching Virginia, and about, you know, every couple of minutes, it jumps by about 100,000 votes, 50,000 to Trump and 50,000 to Congress.
[01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:15.710]  I agree, Harrison.
[01:21:16.649 --> 01:21:26.710]  Virginia is the new Arizona, and by doing that, then they'll have a big battle there, and like you said, looking at the numbers, they shouldn't have projected that, right?
[01:21:27.619 --> 01:21:32.079]  Well, I tell you this, if it does come down to a battle, I like it.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.619]  Republicans control Virginia.
[01:21:34.119 --> 01:21:40.520]  Glenn Youngkin is the real deal with governor, and you got a good lieutenant governor and other good Republicans in Virginia too.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.199]  So if it comes to that, I think that that helps.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:43.840]  Guys, do me a favor.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.699]  Let's go look at Michigan real quick.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:52.140]  Let me just look at these latest numbers in Michigan just to see what we're really looking at as more numbers are coming in.
[01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.069]  Less than a million votes reported to Michigan so far.
[01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.229]  I just don't like it.
[01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:00.609]  Give me a Detroit County here real quick, guys.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.539]  Yeah, I mean, these numbers aren't gonna hold.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.600]  There's no way.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:12.220]  I mean, in Wayne County, I believe that Joe Biden got 75% of the vote.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.060]  Now, maybe Trump is flipping these counties.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.279]  Maybe we're gonna see a miracle in Michigan.
[01:22:19.039 --> 01:22:27.159]  I mean, if Donald Trump gets 40% of the vote in Wayne County, I think he wins Michigan.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.500]  These numbers are way too early to make any judgment.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.199]  Maybe that's our miracle.
[01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:34.800]  Maybe that's our Motor City miracle.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:41.159]  I mean, if we get a Motor City miracle, if Trump gets 40% of the vote in Wayne County, I think he wins Michigan.
[01:22:41.279 --> 01:22:46.939]  But these numbers are too early to tell, so I don't wanna make any judgments off these early returns.
[01:22:47.239 --> 01:22:54.039]  Detroit is also potentially the most corrupt city in America when it comes to voter fraud with Jocelyn Benson as the Secretary of State, right?
[01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:57.529]  I'm not as...
[01:22:57.529 --> 01:22:58.590]  Oh, wait a second.
[01:22:59.609 --> 01:22:59.970]  Virginia...
[01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:00.890]  Okay, never mind.
[01:23:01.029 --> 01:23:01.109]  Sorry.
[01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:05.109]  I mean, Trump is still up in Virginia, but they're still saying it's called for Harris.
[01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:07.310]  So we'll still wait for more on that.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.600]  That's what we got so far.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:18.140]  So the official count right now, according to 270 Wynn, is Harris with 105 and Trump with 210.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.739]  So according to them, Trump is already over 200.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.859]  But Georgia, they still have not called.
[01:23:24.479 --> 01:23:25.800]  Virginia, they've called for Harris.
[01:23:26.939 --> 01:23:28.180]  No other big surprises.
[01:23:28.359 --> 01:23:33.460]  And Pennsylvania is still totally up in the air, I think, because of the delays that we're experiencing.
[01:23:33.859 --> 01:23:35.859]  Guys, give me Richmond County real quick.
[01:23:36.039 --> 01:23:37.420]  It's that tiny little, there we go.
[01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:40.569]  Let me see what we have returns here.
[01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.010]  Yeah, these are still early.
[01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:46.890]  So they're still gonna get probably 60,000, 70,000 votes in Richmond City.
[01:23:47.069 --> 01:23:49.250]  That's what they're relying on to call it for Virginia.
[01:23:50.949 --> 01:23:54.829]  But again, there's still tons of votes to come in from the rural areas.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.520]  Yeah, Trump needs Virginia, I think, with what I'm seeing right now.
[01:23:59.899 --> 01:24:12.840]  Unless we pull off a Motor City miracle, I think Trump is gonna need Virginia because Arizona and Nevada is not going to be enough if the Democrats take Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:18.619]  So we'll continue to monitor those, but there's not gonna be any wild cards on the East Coast.
[01:24:18.619 --> 01:24:19.760]  He's not gonna get New Hampshire.
[01:24:19.899 --> 01:24:20.939]  He's not gonna get New Jersey.
[01:24:21.239 --> 01:24:22.619]  He's not gonna get Maine.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.380]  So no wild cards there.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:37.640]  So now you're looking at a situation where he needs to hold Virginia or he needs to pull off a miracle in one of these states, because I don't see where the electoral votes come from.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.739]  Otherwise, I just don't see it on this map right now.
[01:24:41.979 --> 01:24:45.159]  And there's only 16% that are in right now for Virginia?
[01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:48.979]  No, it should be much higher than that by now.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:49.880]  What's it at?
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.579]  Let me find out.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:52.479]  62%.
[01:24:52.479 --> 01:24:53.479]  62%.
[01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:53.979]  Yeah.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.720]  But Trump continuing to maintain a 20,000 vote edge.
[01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.300]  I just, I don't know.
[01:24:59.439 --> 01:25:07.760]  I mean, again, there's still gonna be probably 60,000, 70,000 that's gonna flip in these big areas and down here for Harris.
[01:25:07.939 --> 01:25:11.539]  But Still plenty of votes to come in in the rural areas.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.579]  I mean, to me, this is a dead heat right now.
[01:25:13.939 --> 01:25:14.979]  This is a dead heat.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.979]  I don't know why they've called it for Harris other than they know this is Trump's path to victory.
[01:25:19.979 --> 01:25:24.380]  And so- Well, probably too, because if it does flip, then it's gonna be a problem.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.119]  Cuz then everyone's gonna say that it's rigged or something.
[01:25:28.039 --> 01:25:31.439]  Well, if Trump wins Virginia, they know that that's it.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.199]  And then at that point, all Trump has to do is win Nevada.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.180]  So if they call Virginia and Georgia, all Trump needs at that point is Nevada.
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.520]  And he doesn't need any of these other states.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.720]  So that's why I think they're calling Virginia for Harris right now.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.119]  But this is still in play to me.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.199]  It's too early to really analyze Michigan or Wisconsin at this point.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.779]  And I just don't like what I'm seeing in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:53.779 --> 01:25:54.500]  I'll be honest.
[01:25:54.619 --> 01:25:56.119]  I think Pennsylvania is looking bad.
[01:25:56.789 --> 01:26:01.850]  And it's really too bad because there was so much money spent on Pennsylvania.
[01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:04.270]  There was so much of a ground game on Pennsylvania.
[01:26:04.609 --> 01:26:05.989]  Musk spent so much time there.
[01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.270]  Scott Presler spent so much time there.
[01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:13.529]  And The Democrats won the rulings on the mail-in ballots.
[01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:19.489]  They run a completely joke of a system with early voting, which isn't even early voting.
[01:26:19.789 --> 01:26:20.949]  That's all mail-in ballots.
[01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:22.989]  So Pennsylvania is a disaster.
[01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:24.569]  It's just an absolute disaster.
[01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.930]  I wouldn't be surprised by the result at the end of the night.
[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:30.029]  I think a lot of Republicans will be.
[01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:33.250]  I think a lot of the Trump campaign will be.
[01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:37.409]  But These returns are not good.
[01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:40.090]  Guys, give me Philadelphia County real quick.
[01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.729]  So why do you think that it didn't go red this year?
[01:26:43.829 --> 01:26:46.350]  Because everyone was really hopeful, especially with all the rallies.
[01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:47.510]  The turnout was amazing.
[01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:54.329]  I mean, again, they do mail-in voting out the wazoo.
[01:26:55.439 --> 01:26:58.000]  Yeah, this is not looking good for Trump, I'll tell you right now.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.260]  It's not looking good for Trump.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:04.840]  I don't know what goes on with Philadelphia for Democrats to get 80% plus of the vote.
[01:27:05.039 --> 01:27:08.039]  They do similar numbers in the greater Philadelphia area.
[01:27:08.279 --> 01:27:09.500]  It's all mail-in voting.
[01:27:09.539 --> 01:27:11.159]  It's just all mail-in voting.
[01:27:11.319 --> 01:27:12.380]  It's all vote harvesting.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.960]  They don't clear the rolls.
[01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:16.560]  They don't do voter signature verification.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.220]  Mail-in voting needs to be completely eradicated.
[01:27:20.439 --> 01:27:26.479]  And until you do that, these states like Pennsylvania will now stay blue.
[01:27:26.699 --> 01:27:28.239]  So that's what you're dealing with.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.920]  And people don't want to be honest about it.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.380]  They don't want to be honest about how bad it is, but that's how bad it is.
[01:27:33.479 --> 01:27:45.600]  So I would say, based off these numbers, Philadelphia is gonna continue to determine the fate of Pennsylvania and all that money and all that effort and all that hope that this victory would go through Pennsylvania.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.720]  Is going to break a lot of hearts.
[01:27:50.119 --> 01:27:51.579]  Still early, still early.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.500]  And I will say, the late returns will favor Donald Trump.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:03.460]  But there's still potentially 400,000 votes for Harris just in Philadelphia County alone.
[01:28:03.699 --> 01:28:05.560]  I don't know if you can overwhelm that.
[01:28:05.699 --> 01:28:06.319]  I don't know.
[01:28:06.479 --> 01:28:08.300]  I think that this is gonna be tight.
[01:28:08.539 --> 01:28:12.859]  But based off of these numbers, it's, I don't know.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:13.920]  I'd say it's not looking good.
[01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.090]  No, and I agree, too.
[01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:16.670]  I think the mail-in ballots have to go.
[01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:18.510]  It makes no sense, right?
[01:28:18.569 --> 01:28:21.789]  That was usually just for extreme circumstances for people now.
[01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:23.789]  Well, I mean, think about what a disaster Pennsylvania is.
[01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:26.229]  You got voting machine issues all day long.
[01:28:27.489 --> 01:28:32.069]  Because of their mail-in ballot early voting system, people couldn't even vote early.
[01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:33.710]  They had to extend early voting.
[01:28:33.829 --> 01:28:35.609]  They already had to extend voting tonight.
[01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:37.710]  In fact, I don't even know, have the polls even closed?
[01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:40.369]  I don't even, the polls haven't even closed in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:43.050]  I mean, this state is a joke, honestly.
[01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:47.220]  Philadelphia and the Democrats that run Pennsylvania are a joke.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:57.260]  And I was hoping that Trump would win this election without Pennsylvania so that people could see what a scam they're running in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.920]  What an absolute scam they're running in Pennsylvania with the mail-in ballots.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.560]  And again, I just...
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:12.460]  We're good to go.
[01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:29.369]  Is that all of these red areas have the biggest turnout in the history of Pennsylvania.
[01:29:29.409 --> 01:29:30.890]  That's what this is gonna take now.
[01:29:31.069 --> 01:29:35.829]  It's gonna take the biggest turnout in all these deep red areas in the history of Pennsylvania.
[01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:37.760]  All right, let me stop you.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.720]  Let me stop you, Owen.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.880]  Let me just stop you.
[01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:42.399]  It was looking really good.
[01:29:42.579 --> 01:29:43.640]  We don't know yet.
[01:29:44.539 --> 01:29:49.039]  But the point is, is we're not going to be like leftists that just panic and freak out and whine.
[01:29:49.939 --> 01:29:53.340]  Machiavellian level, this is way worse for the globalists to do this again.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.279]  And they're going to have their crackdowns.
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:30:08.409]  And Musk said they're going to shut down X. But globalists are in trouble worldwide, and they were about to, if Trump wins, hand him a total collapsed economy, and you see all the real liberals that weren't evil people like Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr.
[01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:10.289]  and great people coming there.
[01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:16.510]  I see the grassroots, and you've seen illegals everywhere voting, you've seen the machines flipping, you've seen the fraud he hasn't lost yet.
[01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:23.189]  But Trump was very, very cryptic in that Sunday speech he gave in Pennsylvania, and that was the real Trump, okay?
[01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:26.609]  And he's always real, but he's a happy guy out there.
[01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:29.130]  But he's hardcore, very fatalistic behind the scenes.
[01:30:29.529 --> 01:30:30.289]  It's his business.
[01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:32.090]  He said, you've got to get rid of the machines.
[01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:33.310]  You've got to have paper ballots.
[01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:35.750]  I want to go to Mickey Willis, and we're going to play that clip.
[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.510]  Great filmmaker.
[01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:39.029]  You see all those wonderful ads, him and his team.
[01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:39.970]  Some of them are here tonight.
[01:30:42.039 --> 01:30:47.520]  We're good to go.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:49.020]  We're good to go.
[01:30:50.119 --> 01:31:01.260]  We're good to go.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:05.960]  We're good to go.
[01:31:08.649 --> 01:31:09.390]  Well, the mood is good.
[01:31:09.569 --> 01:31:11.449]  My mood was better until I listened to Owen.
[01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:16.149]  You guys are up to speed on this more than everyone here in the room because it's very loud.
[01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:21.189]  There's a lot of big screens playing and a lot of mingling happening.
[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:23.989]  Elon is here and everyone you can imagine.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.840]  And every now and then, when something good happens on one of the big screens, everyone applauds.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:32.899]  So we're only really seeing the stuff that captures the attention of this crowd.
[01:31:32.899 --> 01:31:37.720]  I learned more from listening to this live broadcast right now than I have being inside the event here.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.260]  But overall, the mood is very optimistic.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.300]  People, particularly in the beginning, there's a lot of celebration.
[01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:51.659]  Being from Texas, as you guys are too, of course, watching what's happened in Texas was great news.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.140]  But I agree with Owen.
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:32:09.600]  We have a couple of very, very important states here that Other than Stockholm Syndrome, I cannot fathom what would cause these decimated blue states and these people who have already had their lives turned upside down and destroyed go out and vote for the same people.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:15.220]  It's just, there's a lot of head shaking in here also when we see that some of these deep blue states are doing it again.
[01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:18.439]  So it's just, it's wild.
[01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:20.640]  But, you know, we're just holding for the best here.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.640]  And I'll say whatever direction it goes, I know there's a lot of damage that can be done.
[01:32:25.789 --> 01:32:37.710]  You know, but I've just surrendered to a lot of things that I wanted to happen through life, didn't happen the way I wanted it to, and it proved out to be something that down the road I was grateful for.
[01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:52.869]  I don't know how that would work out in this case, but either direction, I trust that God has a plan, and now we just need to really, you know, roll up the sleeves and all of us say a really deep prayer for our nation and for the rest of the world that this country also defends.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.699]  And I'm not going into the mode of defeat yet.
[01:32:55.699 --> 01:32:57.560]  I think Trump's still going to win.
[01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:59.260]  That's what my gut tells me.
[01:32:59.319 --> 01:33:05.819]  But I could also be miscalibrating because there's such an awakening and that we've woken up and the public's woken up and that's going to be the victory.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.939]  That's clearly there.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.279]  And then they steal it.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.079]  It's been so out in the open, the open attempt to steal it.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.359]  The fraud is there everywhere.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.119]  That this will be their Waterloo if they try to steal it.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:21.039]  The problem is they're going to try to start World War III, they've said, as the political crackdown to get control.
[01:33:21.199 --> 01:33:23.279]  But it hasn't happened yet.
[01:33:23.279 --> 01:33:33.500]  But when I saw Trump very cryptically Sunday, right after I did an emergency show Saturday, off intel and sources that the Democrats say, don't worry, we've got it.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.420]  And Obama's running the show.
[01:33:35.539 --> 01:33:37.720]  When I saw that clip, I just said, hey...
[01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:45.109]  You know, we need to be, you know, ready for whatever because, and they've already pre-programmed that when she wins, we're going to get violent.
[01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:46.470]  No, that's provocateur.
[01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:47.949]  That's not what we do.
[01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:51.149]  They're going to try something much bigger than J6 or the fake Whitmer kidnapping.
[01:33:51.689 --> 01:33:52.930]  Mickey, what's your take on that?
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:34:01.800]  Well, I think it's very important, Alex, what you're saying, because what they want, as we've known, we've all been saying it for the past year or two, they want civil war.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:14.060]  Civil war will allow them to enact the completion of the police state, justify lockdowns, and eliminate what's remaining of our civil, human, and constitutional liberties.
[01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:23.949]  And so it's very important that anyone who's listening to this That if it doesn't go in the way that we would like it to go, that you understand that rage, you've got to channel that rage into something productive.
[01:34:24.369 --> 01:34:40.529]  Because there's really the reason that the media, and I've, you know, 35 years of, I know the media very well, and the reason that they are using the weapon of fear is because it's one of the most powerful motivators to give people to actually take physical action.
[01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:44.729]  So it can activate people into riots.
[01:34:44.949 --> 01:34:51.489]  It can actually activate people into a much deeper and productive response to what's happening.
[01:34:51.630 --> 01:35:01.369]  And so I would say to the people, just really, you know, take a deep breath, watch every direction this goes in, and understand that we can no longer give them what they want.
[01:35:01.569 --> 01:35:12.649]  You know, too many people gave them what they want in time of COVID. You know, allowed them to act tyranny over their lives and told us who we could stand next to and who we could associate with and what we had to wear.
[01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.310]  And we just can't give into it like that any longer.
[01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.770]  And so I think the people, you know, as they say, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
[01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:31.250]  And I will say that I'm in the room here with a bunch of people, people that I've known for years, including Tulsi Gabbard and Prince, that we're all deeply under the side, like myself, all of our far-left aggressors.
[01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:34.069]  And they're all waking up.
[01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:46.489]  And so I believe in whatever direction this goes into, despite the fact that if it went in the wrong direction, there would certainly be some irreversible things that would take place that would be detrimental to our nation.
[01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:57.850]  But I will say that, I mean, let us look at the last few years to understand that if you didn't believe in God until all this stuff happened, hopefully you do now, because it certainly strengthened my faith.
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:01.020]  Because everything they've done has backfired.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:08.420]  Everything, no matter how many trillions of dollars and how many big brains and big IQs are behind these strategies, they backfire.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.100]  And so I always say, this too shall backfire.
[01:36:11.319 --> 01:36:16.899]  And so whatever they have planned, let us take a step back after tonight, wait for the results.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.579]  I won't give up either.
[01:36:19.739 --> 01:36:23.760]  I really believe that we're heading into a good direction.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.260]  As I said, I was feeling really good until I listened We're good to go to some of Owen's reports, and I don't disagree with him.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.279]  But that's the reality that we need to face right now, is it's not in the bag.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.979]  And if it goes in the wrong direction, then understand that they want us to react to that.
[01:36:38.079 --> 01:36:40.500]  If we can't, so what we must do is act in a way.
[01:36:40.819 --> 01:36:42.699]  You know, I have a lot of friends.
[01:36:42.699 --> 01:36:46.880]  This has pushed them into running for their local office, people that had no interest in politics.
[01:36:47.039 --> 01:36:54.880]  Lily Tang, who has been very viral in the past month, you know, she announced she was running for the stage of our premiere at the Great Awakening.
[01:36:55.210 --> 01:37:00.029]  And, you know, the lady's making some traction with no money behind her, with simple, raw truth.
[01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:09.529]  And so, you know, there's something good happening at the undercurrent of what they're trying to waive our way.
[01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:23.569]  And I just hope that the American people don't take the bait and understand that there's a lot we can do with the disappointment and the rage that we're all sitting on to actually turn things around in this nation in a way that I don't think we ever dreamed was possible in the next few years together.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.699]  But the attitude in this room is very positive.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.619]  Everyone you can imagine is here from every industry except for Hollywood, thank God.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.180]  They're all here and they're all very supportive.
[01:37:33.359 --> 01:37:39.270]  I've seen faces that shocked me and I go up to them and I say, What are you doing here?
[01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:46.109]  You know, all these closet Republicans, closet Trumpers, people that are very well-known, and they're coming out of the shack right now.
[01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:50.930]  And so I think that everyone's realizing the severity of this moment and that it's time to stop fighting.
[01:37:51.369 --> 01:37:54.710]  But I wish I had more data for you in terms of numbers and all that.
[01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:57.520]  You guys are up to speed on that way beyond what All right, Mickey.
[01:37:57.899 --> 01:37:59.960]  Check back in with us tonight, please.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.920]  We'll be here all night.
[01:38:01.039 --> 01:38:01.420]  We love you.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.279]  We love your wife and family, your amazing family.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:03.800]  It's great people.
[01:38:04.159 --> 01:38:06.000]  Such a blessing to have you as a friend.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:07.319]  I've known you for years.
[01:38:07.359 --> 01:38:09.439]  We've become really good friends, and you've really helped me out.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.720]  And you're the guy that finally triggered me to get up off my ass and get in shape.
[01:38:12.819 --> 01:38:15.600]  Joe Rogan was telling me to do it, but you finally did it, buddy.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.000]  This guy behind the scenes literally got it going.
[01:38:19.619 --> 01:38:20.520]  So, you're awesome.
[01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:21.479]  We'll talk to Mickey a little bit.
[01:38:21.659 --> 01:38:25.260]  One of my greatest conferences, and you're doing a great job, Alex.
[01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:26.140]  We're awfully proud of you.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.039]  You've been so committed.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.000]  I'll let everyone know, Alex shows up before my crew sometimes, ready to work out and ready to do it.
[01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:35.960]  So, we'll make a big announcement later about what this is all about.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.260]  But I love you, brother, and all the InfoWars crew.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.340]  I love all of you, and keep reporting.
[01:38:41.439 --> 01:38:41.840]  We love you, too.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.539]  Out of everybody, we're the real fight set.
[01:38:43.619 --> 01:38:45.260]  Find all the stuff Mickey Willis and Maha.
[01:38:47.710 --> 01:38:48.369]  All right, he's gone.
[01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.930]  Here we go.
[01:38:49.829 --> 01:38:50.510]  Cut to him.
[01:38:50.609 --> 01:38:51.250]  It's kind of a cool shot.
[01:38:51.329 --> 01:38:52.090]  I'm walking around in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:53.090]  All right.
[01:38:53.449 --> 01:38:53.850]  Wow.
[01:38:53.989 --> 01:38:56.010]  Let's hope Owen, he's not wrong.
[01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:58.609]  I mean, it's looking razor close.
[01:38:58.829 --> 01:38:59.630]  And here's the bad news.
[01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:00.289]  We knew it was coming.
[01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:03.649]  Just like the other battleground states before, overhead shot.
[01:39:04.989 --> 01:39:07.850]  This is what they did in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, everywhere.
[01:39:08.829 --> 01:39:09.229]  Boom.
[01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:10.529]  You know, it's closer.
[01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:11.590]  The Democrats are losing.
[01:39:11.829 --> 01:39:15.329]  And then they call Virginia, even though it's too close to call.
[01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:16.029]  And then, bloop.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:17.239]  Bloop!
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:29.680]  That's what happened in 2020, and this is what they were trying to do then, and we've been saying, you know, we hope it's this, where, you know, the fraud doesn't work, because we know the fraud's there, it's been confirmed more than ever, and instead, it's starting to look like that.
[01:39:29.739 --> 01:39:43.220]  They haven't gone above yet, but they're going straight up right now, and that's what's being reported out of Virginia, where it was too close to call, but they did call it, and now magically that the polls have closed, and they can close the doors and do their magical work.
[01:39:43.579 --> 01:39:48.000]  Owen, Harrison Smith, it looks like we're seeing the skyrocketing.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.220]  It looks like we're seeing that special event.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:58.300]  I would say, and that meme you have, really, it's the Democrats, their straight line up was before the election this time is the only difference.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.199]  We caught them after the election last time, so now they just do it straight up.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:02.720]  But actually, I have good news, Alex.
[01:40:02.899 --> 01:40:04.739]  I actually come with good news right now.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.500]  Pennsylvania is now trending towards Trump.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.340]  Like I said, you're gonna need record turnout.
[01:40:12.579 --> 01:40:16.699]  You're gonna need record turnout in rural Pennsylvania, and it might be coming through.
[01:40:16.939 --> 01:40:18.159]  This is what we're up against.
[01:40:18.159 --> 01:40:20.680]  Guys, give me Philadelphia County real quick here.
[01:40:20.819 --> 01:40:22.800]  This is the big number right here.
[01:40:24.369 --> 01:40:25.689]  Harris still has.
[01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:27.590]  I mean, this is gonna be ridiculous.
[01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:32.609]  Hillary Clinton got 500,000 votes in 2016 in Pennsylvania County.
[01:40:33.029 --> 01:40:35.569]  Biden got 600,000 votes.
[01:40:35.789 --> 01:40:37.949]  An astronomical, impossible increase.
[01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:40.409]  That was the straight up that we saw.
[01:40:40.569 --> 01:40:44.130]  Now, let's just assume Harris gets 600,000 votes here.
[01:40:44.569 --> 01:40:47.789]  She's got, or let's say she gets a little bonus activity, too.
[01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:51.850]  So there's 400,000 votes remaining on the table in Philadelphia.
[01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:59.350]  Guys, zoom back out here, or Montgomery County, or just west of Philadelphia County here, too.
[01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:00.909]  Let me just look at these numbers real quick.
[01:41:03.029 --> 01:41:05.390]  Yeah, guys, give me these counties outside.
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:11.739]  Okay, so she's still got some votes on the table in Chester County.
[01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:14.380]  That one, there's not as many there.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.680]  She's still got some votes on the table in Delaware County.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.260]  And then guys, look up north here.
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.079]  And in Montgomery County, we've got a lot of returns.
[01:41:22.119 --> 01:41:30.000]  So she's probably still got at least- 600,000 votes, I'd say, on the table in the greater Philadelphia area.
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.399]  Guys, let's zoom back out real quick.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.359]  Let me look at Pittsburgh.
[01:41:33.699 --> 01:41:34.140]  Let me see.
[01:41:34.319 --> 01:41:37.220]  I think the returns are actually not so bad for Trump in Pittsburgh.
[01:41:37.399 --> 01:41:38.939]  Guys, let me look at Pittsburgh real quick here.
[01:41:39.939 --> 01:41:41.039]  Not too bad.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.600]  Not too bad, actually.
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:47.770]  If Trump can come in around 40% in Pittsburgh, that will actually help him on the state level.
[01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:48.869]  All right, so zoom back out.
[01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:50.449]  So here's what we're looking at.
[01:41:50.649 --> 01:41:52.609]  And there's different numbers coming in.
[01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:53.890]  It's on a razor's edge.
[01:41:54.029 --> 01:41:56.729]  I don't know if you have different numbers than what I have right now here.
[01:41:57.069 --> 01:41:57.289]  Yeah.
[01:41:57.569 --> 01:41:58.609]  Oh, they've just flipped.
[01:41:58.829 --> 01:42:02.689]  Okay, Trump has just taken the lead in this race.
[01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:04.510]  Trump has just taken the lead.
[01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:08.090]  Both candidates got to 3 million in 2020.
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:09.770]  Never been done before in Pennsylvania.
[01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:11.010]  It's all the vote steroids.
[01:42:11.729 --> 01:42:13.489]  Who knows where this race is going to finish?
[01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:16.970]  Both candidates got to 3 million in 2020.
[01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:18.270]  We'll see where this one finishes.
[01:42:19.449 --> 01:42:20.710]  Things are trending for Trump, though.
[01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:21.750]  I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.689]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:26.329]  Pennsylvania is literally just flipping back and forth minute by minute at this point.
[01:42:26.489 --> 01:42:31.529]  I'm watching the returns live on Google, and it's Kamala ahead, Trump ahead, Kamala ahead.
[01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:33.109]  At this point, it's saying Trump is ahead.
[01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:36.550]  But, I mean, we're talking about a difference of around 10,000 votes.
[01:42:36.729 --> 01:42:40.050]  I would say if I'm being friendly...
[01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:51.250]  It's gonna be the rural counties, record turnout versus whatever the cap is for the Democrats in the Philadelphia area.
[01:42:51.689 --> 01:43:06.590]  If I'm being Dark Owen, you basically have the incredible effort that the Trump campaign put into rural Pennsylvania versus the incredible effort that the Democrats steal is putting forth in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:09.010]  This thing is gonna be on the razor's edge.
[01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:10.789]  Now, here's the good news.
[01:43:10.949 --> 01:43:18.489]  If Trump wins Pennsylvania, his odds to win this deal, I mean, it's like, I'm not gonna seal the deal.
[01:43:18.489 --> 01:43:26.470]  But if Trump wins Pennsylvania, ladies and gentlemen, things are gonna be looking very, very good for Donald Trump moving forward.
[01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:32.050]  But this thing is gonna be flipping back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[01:43:34.050 --> 01:43:43.270]  If we have another situation where both candidates get to 3 million votes, then that means Trump is probably going to have to get 3.3 million votes, I think, to win Pennsylvania.
[01:43:44.369 --> 01:43:51.670]  And which means that he probably got 3.3 million votes and Harris was probably closer to 2.9.
[01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:55.630]  All right, I want to walk through more of this in a moment with both of you and then get Candace's take.
[01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:57.989]  And then Roger Stone said to be on in a few minutes, but I want to say something right now.
[01:43:59.110 --> 01:44:00.350]  I've been saying this for months.
[01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:03.710]  I don't look at the situation and come up with some idea for it now.
[01:44:04.210 --> 01:44:06.550]  Whatever happens tonight, the fraud's out in the open.
[01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:07.569]  He would have won on a landslide.
[01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:15.289]  I still believe and pray he wins because we can stop World War III. But we're going down this road regardless, whatever road we're on.
[01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:16.609]  We're going to find out soon.
[01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:33.130]  But the way this brought all these great people together, the way it brought the best out of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and Trump and all of us, and the way we saw this outpouring of people coming across political lines because of the common sense and the survival mechanism and the spirit I'm seeing,
[01:44:33.329 --> 01:44:36.909]  we're winning the war regardless whether they rig this battle.
[01:44:37.329 --> 01:44:39.890]  Now, it'd be a nice little, you know...
[01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:50.750]  I'm committed.
[01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:53.869]  I'm not worried.
[01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:54.649]  I don't think about myself.
[01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:55.829]  I think about the aggregate of everybody.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:04.380]  But I just want to say I'm proud to know everybody associated with the truth, and our team has light in their eyes and justice and love in their hearts.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:12.079]  And this is historic, and I just want to get that out there, that if they steal this, we're going to expose them, but we're not going to scream and cry about it.
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:21.890]  And just like Mickey Willis said, all of the big leftists that meant well that were conned, I mean, really great people, Not just the famous ones, across the board, know what's going on.
[01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:29.270]  So they hope they can bring in third world people that are refugees of globalism and lockdowns, that they control, and we'll wake them up too.
[01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:31.149]  I mean, people want freedom.
[01:45:31.409 --> 01:45:41.409]  And so you've seen in Europe where they steal elections and it comes out, or even when the conservative or populist parties win, the governments say, we're not going to let you into power in Austria right now.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.359]  But you can only hold that back so long.
[01:45:44.659 --> 01:45:56.479]  I mean, they use parliamentary manipulation with Trudeau getting 19% or Netanyahu 19% or, you know, Macron 18%.
[01:45:56.479 --> 01:45:59.060]  They are not popular, okay?
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.640]  Now, here we got two parties.
[01:46:01.329 --> 01:46:05.050]  So it's harder for them to do a parliamentary manipulation with a coalition of groups in the parliament.
[01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:06.930]  Here, it's the two big parties.
[01:46:07.489 --> 01:46:11.170]  But the fraud brings in, that's a little extra coalition they've got.
[01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:21.390]  So, look, this is a long, hard fight, like I've told people, but pray to God we get a bigger majority in the House and Senate to block Harris and block their confirmations if they do get in.
[01:46:21.729 --> 01:46:22.770]  But this is an epic moment.
[01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:24.050]  So let me bring this up, Owen.
[01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:28.050]  Let's focus, because you're on this, and you've got the numbers, and Harrison, too.
[01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:29.970]  Jump in, and Candace, any time.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.380]  What's happening in the House and Senate races?
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.060]  What are the projected numbers right now?
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:36.880]  Because Trump's too close, this is too razor's edge.
[01:46:37.279 --> 01:46:39.939]  We'll know more as this unfolds, but what about the House and Senate?
[01:46:40.699 --> 01:46:43.159]  It's looking good, honestly, everything that I'm seeing.
[01:46:43.359 --> 01:46:45.119]  Yeah, I'm gonna go look at that.
[01:46:45.319 --> 01:46:50.640]  I'm gonna pitch it to Harris in a second, but look, I've always been the one trying to keep us down to earth, okay?
[01:46:52.079 --> 01:46:54.520]  I really like what I'm seeing in Wisconsin right now.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.880]  Wisconsin is looking very good.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:05.539]  And based off of these numbers and trends, this is the best Wisconsin has looked for Trump, and it's still early.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.819]  Guys, give me Milwaukee real quick.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.079]  Yeah, that's not a good number.
[01:47:11.279 --> 01:47:12.960]  That's not a good number for Harris.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:17.220]  Harris is gonna need minimum 70% in Milwaukee, maybe even 80.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.539]  Zoom back out and give me Madison, guys.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.159]  Let's look at Madison.
[01:47:28.279 --> 01:47:32.560]  Okay, yeah, that's probably where she needs to be, maybe in Madison.
[01:47:32.819 --> 01:47:34.960]  But if she doesn't get, let's go back to Milwaukee.
[01:47:35.159 --> 01:47:41.020]  I think Harris might need, I mean, 70% minimum.
[01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:45.510]  But she might need 80% to win Wisconsin.
[01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:47.170]  I like what I'm seeing in Wisconsin.
[01:47:47.329 --> 01:47:48.090]  Let's zoom back out.
[01:47:48.489 --> 01:47:50.750]  This is the best Pennsylvania has looked tonight.
[01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:53.810]  This is the best Pennsylvania has looked tonight.
[01:47:54.149 --> 01:48:00.470]  And if we zoom in on Pennsylvania, Trump's increasing his lead.
[01:48:00.729 --> 01:48:01.909]  Give me Philadelphia County.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:08.119]  And this is, look, she's running out of votes here, Alex.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.140]  She's running out of votes here.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:17.010]  So unless she has 700,000 votes in Philadelphia Pennsylvania trending for Trump.
[01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:21.770]  If Trump wins Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the path to victory gets clear.
[01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:23.750]  So I come bearing good news.
[01:48:23.989 --> 01:48:28.430]  I'll give it to Harrison, and I'll go look at what's going on in the congressional races.
[01:48:28.649 --> 01:48:36.029]  Well, and it's still way too early to tell in Minnesota, but our boy Royce White is ahead of Amy Klobuchar.
[01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:36.949]  Yes, I love him.
[01:48:37.130 --> 01:48:38.390]  But I do like seeing that.
[01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:40.670]  I do like seeing that at least momentarily.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.720]  I mean, everything seems to be trending towards Trump.
[01:48:43.899 --> 01:48:48.880]  Pennsylvania, remember, we started the night with something like 300,000 deficit for Kamala.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:51.899]  So he has closed the gap and is now ahead in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:55.119]  He's still ahead in Virginia, 64% reporting.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:49:00.260]  That race is still razor thin, less than 30,000 differential there.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:03.119]  North Carolina holding steady for Trump.
[01:49:03.539 --> 01:49:09.479]  Georgia seems like a Trump lock at this point, 81% reporting, 52.2% for Trump.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.569]  So I don't know why they'd call Virginia and not Georgia at this point.
[01:49:14.569 --> 01:49:15.250]  Well, let me just tell you this.
[01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:18.689]  I just talked to three people in the Trump campaign, high levels.
[01:49:18.729 --> 01:49:20.810]  I was, for 20 minutes, I've been texting them, seeing them.
[01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:22.510]  And Ellen's not wrong.
[01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:26.510]  They said it was looking bad for the last 45 minutes, but it's just flipped back to Trump.
[01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:29.710]  The president's very confident.
[01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:35.189]  And I'm going to be talking to some other folks with our Pentagon connections, but...
[01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:39.550]  But they could really pull some crap in the West here.
[01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:41.430]  So we should finish up, Harrison.
[01:49:41.569 --> 01:49:42.069]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:46.369]  And then let's start wargaming how they could try to steal it after that.
[01:49:46.909 --> 01:49:48.090]  But it's flipped back.
[01:49:48.369 --> 01:49:49.670]  So this is talk about a nail-biter.
[01:49:49.869 --> 01:49:51.329]  Because remember, we're up against this wall of fraud.
[01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:53.850]  And then, yeah, Owen, get in there.
[01:49:53.909 --> 01:49:55.770]  I want to know the Senate and House numbers or Harrison.
[01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:56.369]  You guys go ahead.
[01:49:56.789 --> 01:49:58.350]  I'll give you a quick Senate update.
[01:49:58.369 --> 01:50:05.689]  It looks like the Democrats are gonna hold on to their Senate seats in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:10.670]  But, and that's, I think that that's just based off the power of the incumbency.
[01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:17.529]  But, if the trend continues in Pennsylvania, it looks like Trump could drag McCormick across the finish line.
[01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:22.670]  And that would give, I believe, at this point, Republicans plus two.
[01:50:23.319 --> 01:50:26.659]  Picking up West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:30.539]  Arizona's too early, but it's not looking good for Carrie Lake, unfortunately.
[01:50:30.539 --> 01:50:31.460]  I don't get it.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.699]  She's fantastic, but that's just early numbers that we're getting in.
[01:50:35.279 --> 01:50:46.859]  So I'm looking at this right now, and if Trump wins Pennsylvania, he drags McCormick across the line, you're picking up a Senate seat, and you're getting plus two in the Senate.
[01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:49.989]  But let's just continue.
[01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:53.350]  Let's not get ahead of ourselves on Pennsylvania, but it's looking good.
[01:50:53.529 --> 01:51:00.510]  But even with some of the good numbers we're seeing in Wisconsin, it looks like the Democrats are going to hold on to that Senate seat for now.
[01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:07.729]  Yeah, so as of now, one seat has flipped from Democrats to GOP in the Senate and in the House.
[01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:13.229]  Two have flipped from Democrat to the GOP. So maybe that's a silver lining here.
[01:51:13.909 --> 01:51:16.390]  But yeah, things are still very much up in the air for everything.
[01:51:16.529 --> 01:51:21.789]  And that's the craziest thing to me is how razor-thin every single one of these states is, how they keep flipping back and forth.
[01:51:22.449 --> 01:51:24.149]  Wisconsin, 44% reporting.
[01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:27.750]  We're talking about less than 2,000 vote difference there.
[01:51:27.989 --> 01:51:29.010]  So, I mean...
[01:51:29.789 --> 01:51:31.909]  Razor thin doesn't even describe it.
[01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:35.210]  Michigan, less than 20,000 differential there.
[01:51:35.409 --> 01:51:38.329]  So it really shows you how important that voter turnout is.
[01:51:38.569 --> 01:51:44.510]  And these races could be decided by a couple hundred votes at the end of the day.
[01:51:44.850 --> 01:51:45.670]  Still waiting.
[01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:52.550]  Pennsylvania, 50% reporting, and Trump is leading by 74,000 votes at this point.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:59.720]  I think it's safe to say, again, I think it was safe to say plus four in the House for Republicans.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:07.859]  I'd say it's plus four, maybe plus eight is the range I'm looking at right now, and that could be conservative.
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.739]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:13.539 --> 01:52:26.279]  Yeah, well, actually, the DCCC chair said, oh, Trump will win on election night, but then we'll take the House, the Senate, and the presidency later on.
[01:52:26.399 --> 01:52:27.899]  I mean, that's the DCCC chair.
[01:52:28.079 --> 01:52:30.600]  So, I mean, they're basically telling you what they're gonna do.
[01:52:31.279 --> 01:52:35.720]  But we're just gonna continue to react to the numbers that we have coming in right now.
[01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:40.689]  And the trend in Pennsylvania has been fantastic.
[01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:42.970]  I mean, there's no other way to put it.
[01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:46.609]  The trend in Pennsylvania has been fantastic.
[01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:50.430]  And I'm going to dig deeper into these numbers.
[01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:56.489]  Well, I mean, listen, I was in Redding with Tucker, but me and Tucker and everybody stayed a place 30 miles away, which you always do for security.
[01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.630]  And we were in...
[01:52:58.630 --> 01:52:59.850]  God, what big town was that?
[01:53:00.029 --> 01:53:00.489]  It was...
[01:53:01.710 --> 01:53:04.630]  Ask Dew, he'll remember, he was there with me, Lancaster.
[01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:11.449]  And, you know, I like to walk, so Dew and I would get up at like 6.30 and go walk for, you know, have coffee or wherever we have coffee.
[01:53:12.029 --> 01:53:15.510]  And I walked, you know, two days we were there, five, six miles every day.
[01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:20.449]  And, I mean, people were coming out of their houses, their apartments, the police, the fire department.
[01:53:21.090 --> 01:53:22.449]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:25.149]  I mean, I couldn't, you know, I wasn't even trying to talk to people.
[01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.949]  I was getting mobbed.
[01:53:25.989 --> 01:53:26.869]  Everybody's like, screw them.
[01:53:26.989 --> 01:53:27.470]  We're going to win.
[01:53:27.630 --> 01:53:28.329]  We're going to get it back.
[01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:30.510]  The cops came over and shook my hand.
[01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.149]  So, I mean, it was like, wow.
[01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:34.010]  And I was all over Pennsylvania.
[01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:35.989]  And people were pissed.
[01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:39.470]  I mean, I didn't see where these mythical Democrat voters are.
[01:53:40.159 --> 01:53:55.560]  No, I loved your perspective earlier and the guest that was on just a little bit ago and I'm not like entertaining defeat either right now, but I do think a lot of people are waking up and regardless of what happens at the end of the night, I think that the people are going to band together.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:03.380]  And if you see people that are trying to destroy this country, destroy your freedoms, take away our constitutional rights, I don't think that they're going to be okay with that.
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.020]  It's like that traditional power versus force.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:11.579]  So regardless of whatever happens today, I still think that the American people are gonna win in the bigger picture.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:17.500]  And then if anything does happen that's gonna be a little bit dodgy in the future, that we're not gonna bend this time.
[01:54:17.699 --> 01:54:18.880]  So it's still hopeful.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:19.739]  I agree.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:24.960]  And what is it like for you to see Elon go all the way in, Rogan go all the way in?
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.300]  People are committing now.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.859]  They're putting the skin in the game.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:29.500]  They're going to come after Elon.
[01:54:29.659 --> 01:54:30.659]  They're going to come after everybody.
[01:54:30.939 --> 01:54:38.310]  And it's just good to see Americans stand up to this garbage and It's just beautiful.
[01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:45.289]  So I want to get your take on that, but I see Roger Stone has connected there at Mar-a-Lago there as all of this unfolds.
[01:54:45.369 --> 01:54:46.250]  He's gotten to a quiet place.
[01:54:46.649 --> 01:54:59.130]  The former chief strategist, President Trump, the guy that literally started talking to him decades ago about running, and of course a former political president talking about the system, like my co-host Owen and so many others.
[01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:02.109]  The great Roger Stone of StoneZone.com.
[01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:09.350]  Who joins us now at this incredible hour as we try to track this and look at this.
[01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:12.390]  Roger, you are the political expert.
[01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:15.010]  That's why the globalists hate your guts because you're on our team.
[01:55:15.449 --> 01:55:17.689]  Give us what you really think right now, Roger.
[01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:18.550]  What's really happening?
[01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:34.869]  I think we are on the cusp of a complete political realignment in the country in which all people, Republicans, Democrats, independents, free thinkers, anybody with common sense He's voted for Donald Trump,
[01:55:35.029 --> 01:55:38.810]  but more importantly, voted for his America First policies.
[01:55:39.029 --> 01:55:42.770]  The globalists' heads are exploding tonight, exploding.
[01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:53.689]  They are now going to move, of course, to plan B, because I think once Michigan reports, they will hold Pennsylvania out as long as they can.
[01:55:54.270 --> 01:56:06.510]  President Trump has already gone online at TrueSocial and at X to complain about the shenanigans of the Pennsylvania, or I should say the Philadelphia Democrat machine.
[01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:09.689]  This is an old, old game.
[01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:18.670]  But the entire strategy of grassroots activism and making it too big to rig appears to me to be working.
[01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:35.939]  And therefore, we can expect Jamie Raskin, the communist congressman from Maryland and his co-conspirators to move to plan B, which of course is to try to fight the certification of Trump by the Congress.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.640]  Roger.
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:44.979]  You have had the most accurate political analysis of anybody I've ever heard.
[01:56:45.399 --> 01:56:52.560]  Most of this, obviously, some of it's been private, but you did tell me that Trump was going to lose four years ago.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.000]  He'd really win, but it wasn't big enough to stop the steal.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.420]  You've said on air that...
[01:56:57.449 --> 01:57:01.170]  You believe he can even win tonight because the landslide in reality is so big.
[01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:03.149]  The fraud is baked in, but we can get over it.
[01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.909]  There's a seawall.
[01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.050]  Red Wave makes it.
[01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:07.350]  If it's big enough to get over the top, if a little bit gets over, we win.
[01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:09.510]  It won't look big, but it is a realignment.
[01:57:09.729 --> 01:57:16.890]  You see it in the real evidence everywhere on the street, and you see the globalists panicking and even preparing for a Trump victory.
[01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:20.689]  But I want you to quantify this because tens of millions are watching right now different ways.
[01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:23.210]  Just this clip will probably have 10 million views tonight.
[01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:24.850]  So I want you to start over from Mar-a-Lago.
[01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:27.409]  Explain what you were just breaking down.
[01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:39.869]  It sounds like you're saying looks like Trump's gonna win, but they're gonna go to plan B and try to not certify, but then it looks like the Senate's gaining for the Republicans, the House gaining, or is it too early to tell?
[01:57:40.029 --> 01:57:41.630]  So go through the different scenarios for us.
[01:57:41.869 --> 01:57:43.510]  All eyes are on you right now.
[01:57:44.909 --> 01:57:49.489]  Alex, it's a little early, but there's some very, very favorable signs.
[01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:53.289]  North Carolina falling into place, absolutely crucial.
[01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:58.270]  Remember, 29 of 100 counties severely affected by the hurricane.
[01:57:58.350 --> 01:58:02.149]  We're very concerned about how those Republican counties would vote.
[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:03.350]  Well, they voted.
[01:58:03.569 --> 01:58:05.170]  They managed to turn in their vote.
[01:58:05.369 --> 01:58:09.789]  This is a pivotal moment, North Carolina being called.
[01:58:10.079 --> 01:58:23.140]  The real story that won't surface here for a couple days, I saw late polling, 87% of those voters who were previously going to vote for Robert F. Kennedy did turn out for Donald Trump.
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:29.479]  So common sense Democrats, Democrats who believe in free enterprise, believe in capitalism, believe in God.
[01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:31.850]  I believe in a strong national defense.
[01:58:32.029 --> 01:58:34.569]  I believe in low taxes.
[01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:47.909]  Those Democrats have moved towards Trump, while the globalists, Dick Cheney, what's left of the McCains, little Adam Kinzinger, they've moved towards Kamala.
[01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:50.409]  This is a historic realignment.
[01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.890]  You and I have talked about this.
[01:58:52.270 --> 01:59:07.960]  This is as big as the move to the Democrats in 1932 under FDR, as big as the The victory of Richard Nixon, which finally manifests itself in the election of Ronald Reagan, the same coalition that elected Donald Trump.
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:19.539]  So the movement of Kennedy, Gabbard, Rob Lagojevich, other common sense Democrats, this is a permanent realignment now that we're going to see in our politics.
[01:59:19.779 --> 01:59:23.939]  Now, a couple things need to fall into place, but I think that's happening.
[01:59:24.539 --> 01:59:25.899]  We lost New Jersey.
[01:59:26.439 --> 01:59:29.880]  But far more narrowly than anybody expected.
[01:59:30.399 --> 01:59:32.699]  And it was not a targeted state.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.640]  So that kind of shows you the grassroots movement in the country.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:43.640]  Record victories among absentee ballots across the country, including all swing states.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.359]  Record victories among early voting.
[01:59:47.659 --> 01:59:52.140]  That never happens, never, for Republicans in all of the swing states.
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:58.760]  And as you know, traditionally, We have always outvoted the Democrats on Election Day.
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:07.479]  They have always outvoted us in the early procedures that are more recent, mail-in voting, absentee, early voting.
[02:00:07.699 --> 02:00:09.399]  But we have matched them there.
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:13.880]  The deficit today, I think, is just too great for them to make up.
[02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:19.130]  But this is a permanent realignment, a realignment of common sense.
[02:00:19.329 --> 02:00:23.970]  The globalists tonight, I hate to say this, but they're crapping their drawers.
[02:00:24.609 --> 02:00:31.689]  They're apoplectic because they know that things are going to come back into balance.
[02:00:31.909 --> 02:00:38.350]  We're going to return to a country not run by men, but run by laws and sovereign under God.
[02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:42.810]  This has to have the apoplectic, Alex, apoplectic.
[02:00:43.119 --> 02:00:45.800]  Well, I mean, Roger, you're saying it isn't a Trump victory yet.
[02:00:46.239 --> 02:00:47.079]  Owen Schroyer's here.
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:48.479]  He's got some questions for you.
[02:00:48.819 --> 02:00:49.979]  We're looking at the numbers.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.119]  It looked bad.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.979]  I know a lot's not been reported yet.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:55.140]  It looked really good until about an hour and a half ago.
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.180]  There were about 45 minutes.
[02:00:56.399 --> 02:01:01.720]  You know, we see Virginia called early, and now she has those magic votes shooting up, just like we saw in other areas.
[02:01:02.199 --> 02:01:03.560]  How are the other states looking?
[02:01:03.659 --> 02:01:05.420]  I know you're there with the jumbotrons with all the...
[02:01:06.689 --> 02:01:07.550]  Owen just stepped out.
[02:01:07.649 --> 02:01:08.210]  He's going to come right back.
[02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:13.449]  I'm sure Harrison Smith has some questions, but technically, why are you saying it looks good?
[02:01:14.329 --> 02:01:16.449]  Well, North Carolina was crucial.
[02:01:16.810 --> 02:01:27.170]  Remember in Michigan, where we don't have any results yet, you had almost 800,000 Democrats vote for none of the above in the Democrat primary.
[02:01:27.569 --> 02:01:30.770]  These are mostly members of the Muslim American community.
[02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:33.170]  I think they sit this election out.
[02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:39.609]  They're Their move here is not to support Trump, but to punish Harris and Biden.
[02:01:39.829 --> 02:01:42.170]  That's a very positive development.
[02:01:42.409 --> 02:01:48.770]  Now, you're right, it is still early, but look, carrying Florida by 12.
[02:01:50.159 --> 02:01:52.979]  Trump carried Florida by three four years ago.
[02:01:53.479 --> 02:01:55.699]  Texas, very solid win in Texas.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.039]  They kept telling us Texas was going to be close.
[02:01:58.279 --> 02:02:00.119]  Turned out not to be close at all.
[02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:05.000]  Appears to me like Trump will drag Ted Cruz across the finish line.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.579]  Rick Scott was dragged across the finish line.
[02:02:08.739 --> 02:02:10.399]  That looked close at the end.
[02:02:10.539 --> 02:02:14.800]  By the way, in my home state of Florida, interesting, two constitutional amendments.
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.579]  The constitutional amendment to legalize cannabis goes down.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.979]  But more importantly, the constitutional amendment to liberalize our state abortion law goes down.
[02:02:25.159 --> 02:02:27.119]  That's very, very significant.
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:29.000]  So it's early.
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:30.840]  We still have to look for some things.
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:42.399]  We can never underestimate the deep state's ability to play games, not only on Election Day, but post-election, which is why I go to the most important point.
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:48.369]  If you go to CNN, And our mutual friend Jack Posobiec is the one who showed me this.
[02:02:48.850 --> 02:02:59.789]  Why is their homepage for the last several days all pertaining to alleged Russian interference in our election, of which, of course, there's no evidence whatsoever?
[02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:10.949]  So you see them laying the predicate, if Trump wins a narrow or even a solid victory, to try to delegitimize it.
[02:03:11.399 --> 02:03:15.060]  That's why the drawn-out vote count is so crucial to them.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:35.100]  If they can draw out the count for a week in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, then their media assets in the mainstream media mount this whole Russian interference narrative to try to take the presidency from Donald Trump a second time.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.460]  Roger, Owen Schroer has some questions, and I'll let you get back to the important things there at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.239]  But before we go to him, I know Elon Musk is there, Tulsi Gabbards, I mean, all the who's who.
[02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:48.060]  I got some very nice phone calls from some folks today.
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:48.739]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:03:48.819 --> 02:03:52.140]  But I appreciate, you know, the folks in the campaign thanking me as well.
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:52.819]  I thank them.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:56.760]  But it's not time to start celebrating yet, but I did get some of those calls and texts today from folks.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:58.000]  You're there with them.
[02:03:58.939 --> 02:03:59.859]  What's the spirit like?
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.060]  What's it like to be around such a dream team of such great people?
[02:04:03.289 --> 02:04:05.810]  You know, it really is the Liberty League.
[02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:06.649]  It really is.
[02:04:06.789 --> 02:04:08.770]  I mean, Tucker Carlson's here.
[02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:20.710]  Obviously, Robert F. Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, a man who's restored free speech to millions of Americans like you and I. Spirits are high here.
[02:04:20.829 --> 02:04:24.050]  There's a tremendous spirit of optimism.
[02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:32.069]  Everybody knows this isn't in the bag quite yet, but I think the general feeling here, correctly, is it is moving in our direction.
[02:04:32.770 --> 02:04:36.350]  Alex, you're the only member of the Liberty League who's not here.
[02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:42.949]  But you're doing something far more important, talking to millions of Americans and telling them what's really happening tonight.
[02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.770]  Well, that's right.
[02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:46.590]  I've got to stay here at Mount Doom.
[02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:52.029]  But, Owen, Roger's got to go soon, but I know he's your former co-host of the War Room.
[02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:56.489]  Back when Roger used to be here, and we still love having him back on, the original War Room.
[02:04:56.529 --> 02:04:57.050]  I don't think it's Bannon.
[02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:58.390]  We love him, but we are the original War Room.
[02:04:58.869 --> 02:05:01.890]  Owen, any questions for your former partner in crime here?
[02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:05.609]  Roger, what do you rate my election night fit?
[02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:09.329]  No, I'm gonna say it one more time, Owen.
[02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:10.210]  I'm sorry, you woke up.
[02:05:10.210 --> 02:05:12.810]  What do you rate my election night attire here, Roger?
[02:05:13.810 --> 02:05:17.170]  Well, let's see, the way this is, oh, that's a great necktie.
[02:05:17.329 --> 02:05:20.109]  I give that necktie a 10-plus.
[02:05:20.449 --> 02:05:23.470]  You learned well from my InfoWars days.
[02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:29.449]  I always think about you, Roger, and I knew I couldn't let you down on election night.
[02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:32.010]  And by the way, both of them are former political prisoners.
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:36.279]  Well, that's quite the duo there.
[02:05:36.939 --> 02:05:41.340]  No, look, if we had a party, if you're indicted, you're invited, you know?
[02:05:43.199 --> 02:05:46.399]  We'd be the co-chairs of that party.
[02:05:46.699 --> 02:05:49.779]  Roger, all right, let's look at what we have going on here.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:55.359]  It looks like Pennsylvania is now the path to victory for Donald Trump.
[02:05:55.779 --> 02:05:58.819]  You know, I don't know why they haven't called Georgia yet.
[02:05:58.939 --> 02:06:01.439]  I don't know why they haven't called the Senate race in Ohio yet.
[02:06:01.949 --> 02:06:06.470]  Trump might drag McCormick across the line for the Senate race in Pennsylvania.
[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:08.630]  Roger, I'm looking at this.
[02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:19.590]  Harris still has about a plus 600,000 margin in the greater Philadelphia area, but I don't know if it's enough to overcome the rural vote.
[02:06:19.789 --> 02:06:26.689]  I mean, unless we get just ridiculous shenanigans, I don't wanna call Pennsylvania, but I've been down on Pennsylvania.
[02:06:27.029 --> 02:06:29.470]  This is the best I've felt about Pennsylvania tonight, Roger.
[02:06:30.579 --> 02:06:48.220]  Well, look, there has never been a greater example of true grassroots activism than that by Cliff Maloney and Scott Pressler and from great folks at Turning Point USA. We're talking about guts, on-the-ground shoe-leather politics,
[02:06:48.699 --> 02:07:02.510]  living in dumpy motels, eating fast food, working, grinding it out every day, registering voters, and then after the registration deadlines passed, Chasing down those mail ballots to make sure they're mailed in.
[02:07:02.630 --> 02:07:09.449]  Now, 400,000 Republicans four years ago asked for mail-in ballots but did not return them.
[02:07:09.729 --> 02:07:11.930]  That did not happen tonight.
[02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:17.989]  So I think that, yes, the Philadelphia machine will try to play their usual games.
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:24.600]  But I think that the collar counties outside of Philadelphia were going to overperform.
[02:07:24.859 --> 02:07:35.979]  And of course, we're performing extremely strong in what they call the T, the central part of the state, which is more like Alabama than it is Pennsylvania.
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:38.859]  So I'm feeling pretty good about Pennsylvania.
[02:07:39.609 --> 02:07:42.390]  Other than to say it's going to be a long, drawn-out process.
[02:07:42.689 --> 02:07:49.489]  They are going to drag it out to try to maneuver to, in some way, question our legitimate victory.
[02:07:49.890 --> 02:07:51.770]  All right, Roger, we know you've got to get back to it.
[02:07:51.810 --> 02:07:53.350]  You'll come back to us throughout the evening.
[02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:55.210]  We really appreciate you, StoneZone.com.
[02:07:55.329 --> 02:07:59.229]  But just looking at other key states, how important is Nevada?
[02:07:59.489 --> 02:08:01.729]  What do you think right now, snapshot of Arizona?
[02:08:01.850 --> 02:08:02.770]  I know it's too early to tell.
[02:08:02.949 --> 02:08:04.029]  What about Wisconsin?
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:10.560]  Let's go to Nevada because I just had a call from a longtime associate there.
[02:08:10.819 --> 02:08:16.420]  The lines of people waiting to vote are literally around the block.
[02:08:16.819 --> 02:08:18.439]  They've never seen anything like this.
[02:08:18.579 --> 02:08:30.489]  The genius of Trump coming out For a repeal of the tax on tips was the death blow to Senator Harry Reid's machine.
[02:08:30.930 --> 02:08:38.529]  The corner piece of that machine was always the hotel workers and casino workers union, known as the culinary union.
[02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:42.029]  It was the absolute cornerstone of that machine.
[02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:51.829]  By that simple proposal for reform, the machine crashed tonight, and I think Nevada is going to be solid for Donald Trump.
[02:08:52.529 --> 02:08:52.770]  Wow.
[02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:58.250]  Any other states you think that in the battleground they're going to fall to the republic out of the hands of the globalists?
[02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:06.390]  Well, Michigan's got to be watched again because, as I say, there's a huge Muslim-American vote there.
[02:09:06.970 --> 02:09:11.550]  700,000 people voted against Joe Biden, voted for none of the above.
[02:09:12.239 --> 02:09:13.539]  It's a protest vote.
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:15.260]  It's not that they go to Trump.
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:23.699]  It's that they don't vote, that they vote for the down-ballot Democrats, but they withhold their vote from Kamala Harris.
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:25.319]  That's the other question, Alex.
[02:09:25.479 --> 02:09:29.659]  I saw Jill Biden at the polling place today wearing a bright red dress.
[02:09:29.859 --> 02:09:31.180]  Who do you think she voted for?
[02:09:31.689 --> 02:09:36.510]  Oh, and you've been saying early on him wearing the MAGA hat, Biden and other things he did was deliberate.
[02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:37.909]  We had a private conversation.
[02:09:38.090 --> 02:09:39.369]  You said, no, I'm leaning towards a deliberate.
[02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:42.390]  Flaming red, Trumpian red.
[02:09:42.710 --> 02:09:44.270]  I mean, what is the message there?
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.039]  Look, I think the Bidens have mixed emotions.
[02:09:48.319 --> 02:09:52.819]  Joe Biden still hates Donald Trump, so I'm not trying to give him a medal of honor.
[02:09:53.079 --> 02:10:01.520]  But he probably hates Barack Obama and Kamala Harris because we both know that they bludgeoned him out of this race.
[02:10:01.619 --> 02:10:05.119]  I think they drugged him, I think they threatened him, and they forced him out.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:14.369]  Now, professional Democrats are scratching their heads and saying, wow, even with his limitations, Maybe it would have been better off with Crazy Joe.
[02:10:14.609 --> 02:10:22.550]  So my guess is that they'll be drinking champagne in the Biden household tonight if Donald Trump wins.
[02:10:22.909 --> 02:10:25.510]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:29.529]  Please check in with us as soon as you can as things unfold.
[02:10:29.529 --> 02:10:31.270]  You call us, you're on.
[02:10:31.449 --> 02:10:32.909]  Stonezone.com, thank you.
[02:10:33.850 --> 02:10:34.369]  Great job.
[02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.829]  Thank you.
[02:10:34.930 --> 02:10:35.689]  God bless you all.
[02:10:35.869 --> 02:10:36.229]  All right.
[02:10:36.409 --> 02:10:38.590]  I'm going to take a break.
[02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:40.670]  And Candice, you're doing awesome.
[02:10:40.810 --> 02:10:41.430]  We love having you here.
[02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:42.270]  Please stay with us.
[02:10:42.449 --> 02:10:44.390]  We got Owen and them ferreting through everything.
[02:10:44.489 --> 02:10:45.090]  Doing a great job.
[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:47.149]  We got a bunch of other big, huge guests coming up.
[02:10:47.890 --> 02:10:49.350]  I am going to...
[02:10:50.869 --> 02:10:52.710]  Quite frankly, go splash some water on my face.
[02:10:52.789 --> 02:10:53.949]  Because it's not that I'm not awake.
[02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:55.050]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:56.149]  I couldn't sleep last night.
[02:10:56.890 --> 02:10:59.229]  And I'm being a good guy up here tonight.
[02:10:59.350 --> 02:11:03.689]  I'm not doing my election time tradition of drinking a bunch on air on election night.
[02:11:04.329 --> 02:11:05.649]  This will drive you to drinking, won't it?
[02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:06.409]  But I'm not doing it!
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:11.039]  But the point is that this is epic, and this is the real deal.
[02:11:11.119 --> 02:11:16.039]  This isn't an election where it's a neocon and a leftist, and they're kind of in the same group.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:22.619]  This is a real rebellion to take our country back, and we've given it one hell of a shot, and that's all that matters is we leave it all in the field.
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:24.800]  I'm going to tell you point blank.
[02:11:25.789 --> 02:11:32.409]  I have all these huge guests on, and despite the fact we're just dominating talk radio, internet, all, you know, just kidding.
[02:11:32.630 --> 02:11:33.409]  I mean, let's be conservative.
[02:11:33.550 --> 02:11:35.609]  A small show each week reaches 30 million people.
[02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:37.149]  The big one's 50, 60 million.
[02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:49.229]  And then I, you know, have, like, congressmen call me and congresswomen call me and other people call me and, like, a very well-known person that just, you know, endorsed Trump a few months ago, you know, calling me and saying, well, what's this about you being shut down?
[02:11:49.590 --> 02:11:50.750]  We didn't know about this.
[02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:52.909]  Well, I haven't made a huge deal out of it.
[02:11:53.329 --> 02:11:55.970]  But crew, type in in Google News, Alex Jones.
[02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:59.149]  And I mean, Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, but nobody reads that, I get it.
[02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:04.710]  Infowars to be shut down as early as next Tuesday at midnight.
[02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:07.890]  Okay, so I'm not a dramatic guy about myself.
[02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:12.789]  I kind of stay at my post firing on the enemy in the Infowar, you know, until we vaporize here.
[02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:24.880]  When they tried 14 weeks ago to send in private security without a court order, the Justice Department did, bluffing, saying that they had an order to shut us down, And I didn't blame the private security.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.199]  They've been told to come in here and do this.
[02:12:26.279 --> 02:12:27.420]  I said, you don't have an order?
[02:12:27.579 --> 02:12:29.119]  And they went, whoa, that's actually a good point.
[02:12:29.159 --> 02:12:30.579]  And people didn't believe it at first.
[02:12:30.579 --> 02:12:36.899]  It was so draconian and so crazy until two days later they filed in federal court.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:39.300]  The U.S. trustee for the U.S. Department said, yeah, we want it shut down now.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.239]  And the judge had a hearing and said, why?
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.640]  They go, well, he's got guns.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.119]  Did he do something illegal with a gun?
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.460]  They said, well, no, there's guns in the building.
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:54.840]  Well, the judge kept saying to the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department, okay, yeah, under federal law, the Justice Department can come in and attach itself to a corporate bankruptcy, like I was in, Ron.
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:56.359]  Okay, very rare.
[02:12:57.170 --> 02:12:58.689]  And the judge said, you're fired.
[02:12:58.909 --> 02:13:01.470]  So they said, well, he just, they got guns.
[02:13:01.649 --> 02:13:02.729]  Will somebody point them at you?
[02:13:02.869 --> 02:13:03.810]  It's legal in Texas.
[02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:06.989]  I mean, yeah, a bunch of people have got concealed carries in there.
[02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:08.989]  It's like I got a cell phone in my pocket.
[02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:10.449]  I mean, it's a tool, okay?
[02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:12.069]  We're not like all fetishizing it like you.
[02:13:12.490 --> 02:13:13.829]  But yeah, we're not a soft target.
[02:13:13.949 --> 02:13:15.970]  You come in here with guns and you're going to get your ass blown off.
[02:13:16.029 --> 02:13:17.409]  But we're not shooting at people.
[02:13:17.569 --> 02:13:18.750]  I didn't threaten the guy.
[02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:20.109]  He tried to set me up.
[02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:20.909]  We caught him.
[02:13:20.989 --> 02:13:22.789]  He tried to file fake stuff at the court that I was a criminal.
[02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:24.050]  We had already filed on him.
[02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:28.649]  So the point is, is that people are like, whoa, they actually tried that.
[02:13:28.789 --> 02:13:31.069]  Yeah, I'm not going to get up here and tell you something that isn't true.
[02:13:31.229 --> 02:13:32.470]  I mean, my career would be over.
[02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:33.810]  Plus, I don't like to lie.
[02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:42.640]  But the point is, We saw big support flood in for a few weeks, and it was literally that money off that that helped us continue on with what's going on, because here's the deal.
[02:13:43.279 --> 02:13:48.100]  I'm fighting federal lawsuits by the Democratic Party, state actions, and guess what?
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.779]  You don't see it in the news, because we've been winning.
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:52.560]  They had a rigged court in Austin with a Democrat judge.
[02:13:52.659 --> 02:13:56.979]  They controlled a rigged court in Connecticut with the Democratic Party, and I was literally found guilty and in show trials.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:57.739]  Okay?
[02:13:59.770 --> 02:14:04.689]  But now they're before other judges that aren't even doing me favors, but they're like, excuse me?
[02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:10.289]  They went in a month ago, and when I first told you, because it had hit the news, they said they own my name.
[02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:11.810]  They own my social media.
[02:14:12.029 --> 02:14:13.649]  The federal judge said, you've got to be kidding.
[02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.949]  No.
[02:14:14.409 --> 02:14:16.869]  So they filed with another court to try to take my name.
[02:14:16.909 --> 02:14:18.289]  You're like, that isn't possible.
[02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:19.609]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:25.229]  Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, they want $2.75 trillion from me.
[02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:27.779]  Okay, they got 1.5 million.
[02:14:27.899 --> 02:14:29.659]  That's the GDP of India, just so you know.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.840]  You're like, I've never...
[02:14:32.729 --> 02:14:34.409]  I had more than $10 million in the bank.
[02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:38.729]  I mean, yeah, I made some money and I was always putting it into things, but I had a war chest.
[02:14:38.909 --> 02:14:43.149]  When they all came after me, I had $10 million in the bank and I was in a $7 million house.
[02:14:43.369 --> 02:14:44.329]  And you know what I did?
[02:14:44.989 --> 02:14:46.649]  I sat there because that was my plan.
[02:14:46.789 --> 02:14:52.649]  Where else could I put money as a backup than in some fancy house on the mountain next door to Karl Rove?
[02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:54.590]  I didn't know I lived two hours down when I got it.
[02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:56.710]  And I bought it for $2 million, sold it for $7 million.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:02.939]  In just three years, and I dumped 100% into this operation when the money was needed.
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:04.380]  I was an investment to do that.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:06.319]  I didn't do this for money, okay?
[02:15:06.539 --> 02:15:09.619]  But I did it to make money to fight them.
[02:15:09.699 --> 02:15:12.199]  And I got a $9 million Bitcoin donation three years ago.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:13.600]  Put all of it in.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:14.439]  Remember, it came out in court.
[02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.250]  Did you keep that money?
[02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:17.289]  I go, well, it was given to me privately.
[02:15:17.369 --> 02:15:17.810]  I could have kept it.
[02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:18.630]  No, I put it all in the company.
[02:15:18.869 --> 02:15:19.909]  We're going to get you on perjury.
[02:15:20.010 --> 02:15:21.130]  The Justice Department's on you.
[02:15:21.250 --> 02:15:32.449]  And the Justice Department investigated it with the U.S. Trustee's Office and found, indeed, I gave all of it to this crew and my operation because I have a mission.
[02:15:32.989 --> 02:15:35.949]  Now, I tell you this.
[02:15:37.439 --> 02:15:38.159]  I'm out of money.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:40.220]  I'm winning my court cases.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:41.920]  I've got really good lawyers.
[02:15:42.359 --> 02:15:47.659]  I had okay lawyers before and great people, but I didn't have heavy hitters before because now it's come out I was innocent.
[02:15:47.899 --> 02:15:54.079]  Now I've got heavy hitters that win the lawsuits against the Democratic Party and against TMZ and against the New York Times.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.560]  That's why you don't hear a word about it.
[02:15:55.659 --> 02:15:56.600]  Crickets in the news.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.020]  Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.
[02:15:58.279 --> 02:16:03.539]  Because now I've got high-powered people that all I've got to pay for is just their staff and the filings.
[02:16:03.659 --> 02:16:04.520]  It's still a lot of work.
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:07.699]  But the point is, we are winning.
[02:16:07.739 --> 02:16:09.880]  I need money to keep this on air.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.239]  This is a symbol, a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:16:12.479 --> 02:16:16.460]  I need money for the crew and the new studio and the operations in case we shut down next week.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:18.699]  If we don't, it just rolls in and we're stronger.
[02:16:18.779 --> 02:16:23.060]  But I need you to support us now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:24.840]  Great supplements, great Patriot apparel.
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.359]  It's all amazing, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:31.119]  And I need you to go to my dad's great supplement company.
[02:16:31.649 --> 02:16:33.190]  Which, by the way, got a bunch of great stuff in it.
[02:16:33.250 --> 02:16:34.149]  I'm going to stop plugging on a break.
[02:16:34.209 --> 02:16:35.170]  We're going to come back with all the news.
[02:16:36.270 --> 02:16:37.430]  These are just staples.
[02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:41.049]  CoQ10, high quality, big dose, incredible for your whole body.
[02:16:41.729 --> 02:16:43.610]  Got some of the write-ups here on the science of it.
[02:16:43.649 --> 02:16:44.469]  You need to know this stuff.
[02:16:44.729 --> 02:16:45.610]  Oh, I just had it.
[02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:46.430]  I'm ranting so much.
[02:16:46.770 --> 02:16:49.409]  And Corsetin Max, 40% off.
[02:16:49.489 --> 02:16:53.989]  You're not going to find quality stuff at this level for anywhere near this at drjonesnatorials.com.
[02:16:54.149 --> 02:16:56.770]  Let me just real fast do this, because in the winter, you definitely need this.
[02:16:57.649 --> 02:16:59.250]  Corsetin, antioxidant properties.
[02:16:59.290 --> 02:17:00.370]  This is from ChatGPT.
[02:17:00.829 --> 02:17:02.209]  Immune system support.
[02:17:02.590 --> 02:17:03.649]  Anti-inflammation effects.
[02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.010]  This has ChatBT, the top A in the world, what corsetin does.
[02:17:06.450 --> 02:17:07.250]  Allergy relief.
[02:17:07.610 --> 02:17:08.770]  Health, heart health.
[02:17:09.170 --> 02:17:10.829]  Antiviral, antibacterial properties.
[02:17:11.069 --> 02:17:11.930]  Supports respiratory health.
[02:17:12.969 --> 02:17:14.870]  Blood sugar regulation.
[02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:16.370]  I mean, you want to...
[02:17:18.409 --> 02:17:20.129]  Yeah, it's like the resveratrol and wine.
[02:17:20.809 --> 02:17:23.950]  Improves exercise performance, but it's super more strong.
[02:17:24.329 --> 02:17:25.809]  Brain health, okay?
[02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:27.790]  Then we've got CoQ10.
[02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:28.670]  Everybody knows about that.
[02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:30.329]  This is just high quality at a great price.
[02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:38.270]  Energy production, antioxidant properties, heart health, improves exercise performance, cognitive health, diabetes management, skin health, immune support.
[02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:39.770]  And I'm on it right now.
[02:17:40.149 --> 02:17:42.389]  Okay, that's there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:17:42.489 --> 02:17:43.209]  Get something you need.
[02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:44.190]  Get a great price on it.
[02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:46.409]  And put your thumb in the eye of the New World Order.
[02:17:46.590 --> 02:17:51.010]  They hate our guts because all I do is eat, drink, and sleep this stuff.
[02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:52.409]  And I know what I'm talking about.
[02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:53.409]  I've got the best guest.
[02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:56.090]  And we've got the enemy's blueprint.
[02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.969]  We've got their number.
[02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.649]  We've got their name.
[02:17:57.729 --> 02:17:58.909]  We've got their ass.
[02:17:59.450 --> 02:18:00.790]  And that's why they want to solve error.
[02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:02.510]  They're not shutting anything down.
[02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:08.889]  The 300-plus radio stations, the hundreds of local cable and TV stations, all of it, they're not shutting anything down.
[02:18:09.229 --> 02:18:14.030]  But we're bellying up right now with the satellite uplinks, all of its ready-paid equipment in.
[02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:15.190]  I flip one switch.
[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:22.549]  One switch, but behind that, I need money, mainly for the legal counteroffenses to keep us on air.
[02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:24.649]  All right, so it's like an X-Wing with shields.
[02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:25.549]  The legal's the shields.
[02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:26.610]  I've got the torpedoes.
[02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:31.530]  I'm going to fire it down the reactor shaft, and I'm going to blow the Death Star up, like we've already done, but they built another one.
[02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:32.229]  I've got to blow it up again.
[02:18:32.489 --> 02:18:34.450]  And the point is, we need your support.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:39.219]  I'm going to stop plugging there.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.579]  We're going to go to break.
[02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:45.659]  And I'm going to come right back with our dream team and so many other guests coming up.
[02:18:45.979 --> 02:18:46.600]  Stay with us.
[02:18:47.239 --> 02:18:48.940]  What's the latest from the crew?
[02:18:49.079 --> 02:18:51.559]  And they're looking at the numbers here in Austin.
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:58.500]  Okay, well, I would say right now it's safe to say Republicans plus four in the House.
[02:18:58.739 --> 02:18:59.520]  That's safe.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.100]  Definitely going to go up from there.
[02:19:01.739 --> 02:19:03.799]  Republicans plus two in the Senate.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:09.200]  Could go up from there, but it looks like you're probably gonna be plus two.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:12.319]  Anything after that would probably be a surprise bonus.
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:15.760]  Pennsylvania continues to look good.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:18.940]  I would say Pennsylvania continues to look good.
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:22.040]  Georgia is tightening up.
[02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:24.709]  Trump continues to maintain his lead.
[02:19:24.909 --> 02:19:30.590]  Before we move on to what we're seeing in Michigan and Wisconsin right now, though, Trump is outperforming everywhere.
[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:32.649]  Trump is outperforming in Maine.
[02:19:32.850 --> 02:19:34.450]  He's outperforming in New Hampshire.
[02:19:34.590 --> 02:19:36.229]  He's even outperforming in New York.
[02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:38.370]  New Jersey is an interesting case.
[02:19:38.530 --> 02:19:40.149]  He's outperforming in Virginia.
[02:19:40.989 --> 02:19:45.790]  Donald Trump is on pace to win the popular vote.
[02:19:47.079 --> 02:19:51.319]  Now, obviously, depending on what happens in California later tonight, who knows?
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:54.360]  But right now, Donald Trump is on pace to win the popular vote.
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:58.100]  Okay, Wisconsin, still really early, but looking good from Trump.
[02:19:58.299 --> 02:20:01.159]  If Trump wins Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, it's over.
[02:20:01.319 --> 02:20:03.559]  Now, I wanna show you what's going on in Michigan, guys.
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:07.889]  Let's zoom into Michigan, because again, Senate races are at stake here.
[02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:16.110]  The Democrats are gonna do everything they can to whatever knobs and buttons and weight they can put on the scales they're gonna do.
[02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:17.649]  Go ahead and go to Detroit.
[02:20:19.649 --> 02:20:24.430]  We have ludicrous numbers in Detroit.
[02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:28.329]  93% in Wayne County.
[02:20:28.530 --> 02:20:30.690]  That is impossible, okay?
[02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:32.690]  Now, this is still early.
[02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:35.229]  Biden got 68%.
[02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:38.340]  Of Wayne County in 2020, 68%.
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:41.479]  And Kamala's coming in at 92.7?
[02:20:41.719 --> 02:20:51.760]  So this thing better balance itself out, or they're gonna try to play games in Michigan with the Senate race, maybe the presidential race.
[02:20:52.059 --> 02:21:02.719]  But that is ludicrous, especially considering the neighboring counties are not going anywhere near those numbers for Harris.
[02:21:03.399 --> 02:21:09.520]  So we're going to be watching what goes on in Wayne County, one of the most corrupt counties in the United States of America.
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:11.600]  That is a ludicrous number.
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:20.040]  But aside from Detroit going 90% from Harris, Michigan, I would say, is still at play.
[02:21:20.159 --> 02:21:25.340]  But if they get 90% in Wayne County, I mean, you know, that'll overwhelm the rest of the state potentially.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:28.219]  But if we zoom back out, Trump's path to victory.
[02:21:28.799 --> 02:21:33.889]  As we sit here right now, 9.54 p.m.
[02:21:34.069 --> 02:21:34.790]  Central Time.
[02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:36.889]  Trump's path to victory.
[02:21:37.129 --> 02:21:40.809]  North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
[02:21:41.489 --> 02:21:44.049]  That is now Donald Trump's path to victory.
[02:21:44.969 --> 02:21:48.549]  Now, if they really wanna play games, they'll just refuse to call it.
[02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:50.010]  They'll just refuse to call it.
[02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:54.590]  But if you look at Georgia, it is tightening up, but the numbers are coming to the midnight hour.
[02:21:54.909 --> 02:21:57.750]  Guys, let me see the latest numbers in Pennsylvania real quick, too.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.459]  I mean, Trump is now up over 100,000.
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:04.760]  Oh, and we're going to come right back to you.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.479]  This is very exciting here at the InfoWars News Center.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.840]  Massive viewers, tens of millions tuned in right now on X alone and everywhere else.
[02:22:12.139 --> 02:22:12.799]  Real Alex Jones.
[02:22:12.899 --> 02:22:17.500]  But I'm going to simulcast quickly with Patrick Bet-David, who's been doing an amazing job covering this election.
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:19.100]  As soon as they're ready, I know we're simulcasting.
[02:22:19.239 --> 02:22:19.840]  I'm here for them.
[02:22:21.979 --> 02:22:28.100]  Because they treat, I mean, those terrorists, they treat us like non-humans.
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:30.899]  Non-believers, non-humans let kill them all.
[02:22:31.059 --> 02:22:32.340]  So he died like a dog.
[02:22:32.459 --> 02:22:34.780]  And I love this quote because he's very straight.
[02:22:34.959 --> 02:22:36.680]  That was argument against him.
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:39.319]  That the language he uses is not diplomatic.
[02:22:39.979 --> 02:22:41.680]  That he tweets mean tweets.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:44.780]  That the way he speaks it's not for the president.
[02:22:45.059 --> 02:22:46.680]  He's the president of the people.
[02:22:46.979 --> 02:22:48.219]  He doesn't have to do that.
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:51.260]  I mean, the amount of money he owns...
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:23:00.819]  He says that many times I would be somewhere on the beautiful sunny island, not Epstein Island, but on some island, and I don't have to do that.
[02:23:00.959 --> 02:23:05.459]  So I would answer and I would describe it as a talent.
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:07.159]  And she has this...
[02:23:07.159 --> 02:23:09.760]  I'm sorry, she has this primitive laugh.
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:12.920]  This laughter is just irritating everyone.
[02:23:13.139 --> 02:23:19.040]  And he's coming, you know, he's coming, he's getting into the room, and you feel this...
[02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.970]  Sigma.
[02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:22.110]  You feel the man.
[02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:24.209]  You feel the guy who's not afraid.
[02:23:24.770 --> 02:23:29.270]  And now in 2024, we need someone who is not afraid and talented.
[02:23:29.649 --> 02:23:33.430]  Okay, I want to come to Candice, but before I do, there's a guy that wants to say hello to everybody.
[02:23:33.909 --> 02:23:35.649]  Rob, if you're ready, bring him on.
[02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:37.549]  Some of you guys may recognize this guy.
[02:23:37.729 --> 02:23:39.370]  Let me know if you recognize him or not.
[02:23:39.909 --> 02:23:44.450]  Rob, if you're ready, if it's in the Zoom, let the man in.
[02:23:44.530 --> 02:23:45.610]  He's in a cage.
[02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:46.809]  He wants to be free.
[02:23:47.329 --> 02:23:48.649]  Do we have him on?
[02:23:49.470 --> 02:23:50.329]  Patrick, I'm here.
[02:23:50.610 --> 02:23:52.649]  I think Joe calls this man a national treasure.
[02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:55.729]  Rob, if you have him on, just show his face.
[02:23:55.850 --> 02:23:56.969]  The moment his face shows up.
[02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.930]  There he is!
[02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.909]  Alex!
[02:23:59.670 --> 02:24:00.290]  Yo, man!
[02:24:02.989 --> 02:24:04.190]  Alex, you're the man!
[02:24:05.569 --> 02:24:06.690]  Poland loves you.
[02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:08.969]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:24:09.129 --> 02:24:09.750]  What's happening?
[02:24:09.909 --> 02:24:11.030]  How you feeling about tonight?
[02:24:11.489 --> 02:24:14.930]  I'm watching the second American Revolution take place peacefully.
[02:24:15.229 --> 02:24:17.590]  Even if they steal this, there's no reversing it.
[02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:19.010]  It's explosive on the street.
[02:24:19.149 --> 02:24:19.729]  It's everywhere.
[02:24:20.329 --> 02:24:22.790]  All the liberals that are good people are joining us.
[02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:24.510]  There's a global realignment.
[02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:26.649]  Populist, anti-globalist being elected everywhere.
[02:24:26.909 --> 02:24:31.049]  Every broadcast that's been fighting tyranny for so long like yours is just exploding.
[02:24:32.079 --> 02:24:34.639]  The corporate old media has been dead for a while.
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:36.120]  Now they're just recognizing it.
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:43.520]  And we've got you and Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk and all of the cool, smart, hardworking, beautiful people who have erased color and creed.
[02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:50.700]  And this is a magic moment despite the wall of fraud and the illegals voting and all of the vote flipping and all of the scams.
[02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:54.510]  All the king's horses, all the king's men couldn't steal the election again.
[02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:55.989]  That's what it looks like.
[02:24:55.989 --> 02:24:57.850]  I'm very optimistic right now.
[02:24:57.950 --> 02:25:00.950]  But regardless, the global awakening is unstoppable.
[02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:03.510]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:07.350]  So no matter what happens tonight, America is back, baby!
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:23.799]  Alex, anything that you're concerned about, is there anything that's going on that you're a little bit paranoid or nervous about or you're pretty steady optimistic?
[02:25:24.459 --> 02:25:29.760]  Well, look, I'm always optimistic when humanity is waking up, but the globalists are openly trying to accelerate war with Russia.
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:32.799]  They are openly trying to expand wars in the Middle East.
[02:25:33.049 --> 02:25:34.370]  They're flooding our borders.
[02:25:34.629 --> 02:25:37.250]  They are trying to consolidate power and control for their great reset.
[02:25:37.530 --> 02:25:41.590]  And so, yeah, we've got a lot of opposition, a lot of problems, a lot of powerful forces.
[02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:45.909]  But before America was asleep, now America has woken up.
[02:25:46.090 --> 02:25:52.649]  The sleeping giants rub the sleep out of its eyes, and it's focused, and it's learning fast, and it's very, very angry.
[02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:54.270]  And they've already tried to kill Trump twice.
[02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:54.889]  They've already tried to kill Trump twice.
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:55.700]  I called all my cousins.
[02:25:55.979 --> 02:25:57.059]  You called all of your cousins?
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:25:57.860]  They swear it's not them.
[02:25:58.139 --> 02:25:59.860]  I don't know.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.860]  LWCTips at ProtonMail.com.
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:04.680]  Please make sure that you're still sending stuff in.
[02:26:04.739 --> 02:26:05.399]  Is he frozen or no?
[02:26:06.139 --> 02:26:07.219]  I'm here, Patrick.
[02:26:07.379 --> 02:26:09.780]  We've got another show dialed in, another show just connected.
[02:26:09.899 --> 02:26:11.459]  We'll reconnect with them in a minute.
[02:26:11.559 --> 02:26:12.520]  A lot going on here.
[02:26:13.219 --> 02:26:14.979]  We had General Flynn break in earlier.
[02:26:16.139 --> 02:26:17.440]  Well, go do your thing, Alex.
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:18.319]  Great to have you on.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:19.079]  Take care, buddy.
[02:26:19.579 --> 02:26:20.239]  We love you, brother.
[02:26:20.879 --> 02:26:22.979]  Remember, Alex, Poland loves you.
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:23.840]  We love you, Poland.
[02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:28.629]  All right, we are back here, and Crowder is ready for us, I'm told.
[02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:31.989]  So let's go ahead and start simulcasting his feed.
[02:26:32.129 --> 02:26:32.649]  Let's put him up.
[02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.829]  I'm here.
[02:26:33.989 --> 02:26:34.549]  I'm ready.
[02:26:34.969 --> 02:26:36.770]  He's here, and I think we can...
[02:26:36.770 --> 02:26:38.290]  He is confirmed, yes.
[02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:45.790]  All right, let's go with the OG, the man who many of you have been waiting to see on this stream, and a good friend of the show, Mr.
[02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:46.389]  Alex Jones.
[02:26:47.090 --> 02:26:49.409]  Steven, an amazing time to be alive.
[02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:51.549]  Well, do you think Trump's going to clench it?
[02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:54.090]  Good Lord.
[02:26:54.250 --> 02:27:00.670]  Alex, we had a whole stinger for you, and we were giving you the introduction, and then you were already talking, so I'm sorry.
[02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:03.809]  But Alex Jones, of course, people can go and support Alex and watch the stream.
[02:27:03.870 --> 02:27:04.709]  What was it you were asking?
[02:27:04.809 --> 02:27:06.209]  We were trying to, we were a little showmanship.
[02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:08.049]  I didn't know about the showmanship.
[02:27:08.049 --> 02:27:09.329]  I've been sitting here waiting to get on.
[02:27:09.409 --> 02:27:10.409]  Hey, start it over.
[02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:11.489]  I want to see the stinger.
[02:27:11.649 --> 02:27:12.629]  I want to see her.
[02:27:12.729 --> 02:27:13.270]  You start over.
[02:27:13.530 --> 02:27:13.829]  Boom.
[02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:14.329]  Steven Crowder.
[02:27:14.329 --> 02:27:15.370]  You can't see the stinger.
[02:27:15.489 --> 02:27:16.010]  It's been done.
[02:27:16.569 --> 02:27:19.010]  Once a stinger, always a stinger, but you do look fantastic.
[02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:20.889]  Did you lose weight?
[02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:22.950]  How many more pounds did you lose since I last saw you?
[02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:24.190]  It was like 48 minutes ago.
[02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:29.649]  I've lost, in the last 70 days, I've lost 34 pounds.
[02:27:31.299 --> 02:27:32.180]  Holy shit!
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:33.100]  Good for you.
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:38.459]  I lost 8 pounds in 12 hours, but that's because I apparently ingested a portion of Satan.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:40.739]  I ingested the sixth ring of hell.
[02:27:40.959 --> 02:27:44.059]  So we're just trying to keep the engine from overheating tonight.
[02:27:44.399 --> 02:27:46.879]  Just trying to keep my fever under 100, 101.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.559]  Otherwise, I'll be going to the hospital.
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:50.780]  I don't know if you just saw it.
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:52.379]  We just called Georgia.
[02:27:52.579 --> 02:27:56.180]  This is the first place to call it, the state, Georgia.
[02:27:56.899 --> 02:27:58.420]  Pretty damn confident in that.
[02:27:58.659 --> 02:28:02.920]  What is it that you're seeing and what is it you're feeling tonight, Alex, or if there's any insight you can give us?
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:06.260]  I mean, it's been very close a few hours ago.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:08.059]  Talk about a nail-biter.
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:14.559]  And I think Pennsylvania is, you know, obviously very close to going for Trump, despite all the fraud and stuff we've seen.
[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:24.459]  And the, I mean, if Trump wins, which I think it's looking more and more like he will, if you look at the electoral map, We're going to see a meltdown like we've never seen.
[02:28:24.659 --> 02:28:29.219]  The top Democrat strategists have been talking about civil war conditions and not certifying the vote.
[02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:33.739]  Carvel's been talking about armed uprisings because Trump's Hitler is going to come kill black men with no evidence.
[02:28:34.079 --> 02:28:36.059]  Whoopi Goldberg says he's going to ban interracial marriage.
[02:28:36.559 --> 02:28:40.600]  I mean, there are a lot of crazy people that believe the BS they've been fed.
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:43.000]  They also believe the Democrats when they say two men can have a baby.
[02:28:43.799 --> 02:28:46.879]  So World War III is on the table here.
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:48.299]  This is a referendum on that.
[02:28:48.850 --> 02:28:51.629]  Trump's got a lot better team around him right now to try to drain the swamp.
[02:28:52.170 --> 02:28:59.469]  And so they've promised to hold this up for weeks, but if it's a decisive victory tonight, I mean, I don't know.
[02:28:59.610 --> 02:29:12.170]  From the numbers we're seeing, like you just said, with Georgia and other things that are happening in Pennsylvania goes for Trump, then I think you look at the electoral map that Trump could be declaring victory tonight.
[02:29:13.639 --> 02:29:16.399]  Yeah, I think there's a strong chance that it could be declaring victory tonight.
[02:29:17.079 --> 02:29:19.219]  You know, we just went through some of these numbers here.
[02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:24.540]  I don't know if you were able to hear it, but I had a sneaking suspicion because we're looking at potentially a win.
[02:29:24.639 --> 02:29:27.780]  Can they confirm if it likely will be somewhere around a million votes in Florida?
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:29.760]  They're saying that it could be that much, but a huge.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.579]  And Alex, a lot of people, you know, are newer to this, right?
[02:29:32.639 --> 02:29:33.540]  We have a lot of Gen Z viewers.
[02:29:33.659 --> 02:29:35.979]  They don't remember when Florida was a nail biter, right?
[02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:38.200]  We'd stay up all night just to hear on Ohio and Florida.
[02:29:38.459 --> 02:29:39.579]  That's kind of taken for granted.
[02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:42.610]  And we looked at the numbers where we saw a huge swing.
[02:29:42.729 --> 02:29:45.389]  So for example, Miami-Dade, an 18-point swing toward Donald Trump.
[02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:46.610]  Broward, a 13-point swing.
[02:29:46.709 --> 02:29:47.590]  Palm Beach, 12 points.
[02:29:47.729 --> 02:29:49.530]  I looked at it and cross-referenced it with New York.
[02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:52.010]  Miami-Dade has 123,000 Jewish Americans.
[02:29:52.170 --> 02:29:53.510]  Broward, 149,000.
[02:29:54.049 --> 02:29:55.290]  134,000 in Palm Beach.
[02:29:55.409 --> 02:29:58.090]  Then we looked in a state where Donald Trump lost.
[02:29:58.610 --> 02:29:59.809]  But we look, for example, Brooklyn.
[02:30:00.010 --> 02:30:02.969]  We saw an 11.6% swing toward Donald Trump.
[02:30:03.329 --> 02:30:05.389]  542,000 Jewish Americans.
[02:30:05.569 --> 02:30:07.170]  Manhattan, 10.7% swing.
[02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:08.750]  356,000 Jewish Americans.
[02:30:08.930 --> 02:30:10.309]  Queens, a 21-point swing.
[02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:11.510]  150,000 Queens.
[02:30:11.610 --> 02:30:12.649]  I bet you'll also be pretty interested.
[02:30:12.889 --> 02:30:16.790]  A lot of Middle Eastern, a lot of Arab American who, by the way, are swinging toward Donald Trump.
[02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:20.750]  Not necessarily in a way that he's winning, but in a way where he's carving off some of those numbers.
[02:30:20.989 --> 02:30:23.229]  I think that may be the story of tonight.
[02:30:23.329 --> 02:30:25.829]  The Jewish American vote and the Hispanic vote.
[02:30:26.010 --> 02:30:28.329]  But we're seeing that kind of track, which...
[02:30:28.649 --> 02:30:30.590]  If so, we could apply to Pennsylvania.
[02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:32.489]  This is something that's obviously near and dear to you.
[02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:34.209]  Does that surprise you, or were you expecting that tonight?
[02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:39.030]  A lot of people I really respect were looking at the numbers.
[02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:43.110]  Even Roger Stone, who's usually a big pessimist, said Trump could win tonight.
[02:30:43.209 --> 02:30:44.750]  And he said that on my show Sunday.
[02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:48.930]  And so, look, people have self-preservation in mind, common sense.
[02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:51.290]  Harris is so detestable, so fake.
[02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:58.930]  It's hard to pick somebody that would compliment her disgustingness, but they were actually able to find somebody that may even be more gross.
[02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.329]  Yeah.
[02:31:00.459 --> 02:31:03.079]  And so the system's been very, very arrogant.
[02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:10.000]  And so, I mean, I'm not surprised that Trump's got a real shot at it to override the fraud.
[02:31:10.139 --> 02:31:10.780]  He had to make it over.
[02:31:10.799 --> 02:31:13.159]  We've got to have a big red wave to make it over the blue seawall.
[02:31:13.879 --> 02:31:14.559]  And so...
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:17.420]  A lot of people I respect were saying, no, it's going to happen.
[02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:19.700]  And even Roger's like, no, I think Trump's going to win.
[02:31:20.239 --> 02:31:22.200]  And he's always been accurate.
[02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:25.979]  He told me in 2020, he said Trump's going to barely win, not as big a turnout.
[02:31:26.459 --> 02:31:28.459]  And he said because of the fraud, he'll lose.
[02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:29.420]  But don't tell anybody that.
[02:31:29.579 --> 02:31:31.860]  And he said that a month before, weeks before the day of.
[02:31:33.309 --> 02:31:43.549]  Do you think that the suspicion that I have here might be correct that we are seeing a significant portion of American Jews no longer in clear conscience being able to support the Democrat Party?
[02:31:43.709 --> 02:31:56.110]  Do you think this is just, again, right now a suspicion, but we're looking at different counties, that that may have played a significant role, for example, in these Yeah, I don't think that's speculation.
[02:32:08.459 --> 02:32:17.540]  And I just think that the people get it and they can smell that, you know, there's no future with Harris and, you know, that Trump's not out to get him and Trump doesn't want World War III. So absolutely.
[02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:19.620]  I mean, I think that's a big part of it.
[02:32:19.659 --> 02:32:24.979]  Like you said, you know, we've got all these Muslims endorsing him in Michigan and, I mean, people just are sick.
[02:32:25.399 --> 02:32:26.559]  Of the current power structure.
[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:28.559]  But then they're going to try to block this.
[02:32:28.719 --> 02:32:29.719]  They're going to try to impeach him again.
[02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:31.819]  They've reportedly already drawn up articles of impeachment.
[02:32:31.979 --> 02:32:37.219]  If he is getting back into office, it looks like the Republicans are taking the Senate, expanding in the House.
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:38.340]  That's just as important.
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:43.659]  So if Trump does get in and has the trifecta, he better drain that swamp and he better deliver.
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:49.159]  And he's being handed, as you know, an economy that's got fire coming out of the engine and smoke shooting out its ass.
[02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:51.399]  So this is a crazy-ass situation.
[02:32:52.489 --> 02:32:53.069]  Is that good?
[02:32:53.489 --> 02:32:55.790]  Before I want to see if I can...
[02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:59.969]  Hey, Toolman, if we show this clip out of Georgia, will Alex be able to hear it?
[02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:01.090]  I can do that, yeah.
[02:33:01.149 --> 02:33:03.530]  Okay, so Alex, we have something breaking right now.
[02:33:03.809 --> 02:33:06.930]  You wouldn't be able to see it, but would you like to be here to hear it?
[02:33:06.969 --> 02:33:07.850]  Let me set this up for you.
[02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:14.370]  Right now, this is some exclusive testimony video that we have that has gone through our team right now to vet it.
[02:33:14.489 --> 02:33:16.049]  So this is from someone named Devin.
[02:33:16.149 --> 02:33:20.950]  He went to go early vote in Georgia on the 21st of October, okay?
[02:33:21.579 --> 02:33:26.719]  They told him, oh, sorry, you were deceased in July of 2023.
[02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:37.700]  So he was allowed to take this photo of the screen, which you can see in the video, and he was given a provisional ballot, told that his vote may not go through, but you'll be registered for next time.
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:40.680]  And we actually have a clip right now that we can play.
[02:33:40.819 --> 02:33:42.479]  You won't be able to see it, but hear it.
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:43.379]  I'll show it to you.
[02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:44.600]  Okay, you'll be able to see it.
[02:33:44.719 --> 02:33:45.479]  Let's show it to Alex.
[02:33:45.879 --> 02:33:47.780]  Hey, my name is Devin Hare, and I'm dead.
[02:33:48.219 --> 02:33:55.899]  I went to go early vote, 21st of October, and found out that I was deceased, and that was why it wouldn't work.
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:57.219]  I was listening to the podcast.
[02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:01.959]  Y'all were talking about, hey, we need to double check that we're registered to vote because there's strange things happening.
[02:34:02.079 --> 02:34:04.459]  I said, okay, I'll just go check it out on the website.
[02:34:04.579 --> 02:34:06.719]  I should be A-OK. My name does not come up.
[02:34:06.879 --> 02:34:09.360]  Show up the 21st, say, hey, here's my driver's license.
[02:34:09.639 --> 02:34:11.379]  They say, we can't find you in the system.
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:12.600]  Let's get you over to this other lady.
[02:34:12.719 --> 02:34:13.139]  She's got it.
[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:15.049]  She's got all the backend information.
[02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:16.030]  She can tell you what's going on.
[02:34:16.090 --> 02:34:19.010]  And she goes, hey, yeah, no, sorry about this, but you're dead.
[02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:20.389]  You are not alive anymore.
[02:34:20.530 --> 02:34:23.090]  You have been since July of 2023.
[02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:24.950]  I would hope I'm still alive.
[02:34:24.969 --> 02:34:27.809]  And she said, yeah, it's just that that system is not working.
[02:34:28.229 --> 02:34:30.350]  You're still alive everywhere else, but, you know.
[02:34:30.729 --> 02:34:32.809]  The voter registration side, you're not here.
[02:34:32.969 --> 02:34:37.670]  My official status for voter registration is canceled, and the reason is that I'm deceased.
[02:34:37.809 --> 02:34:40.010]  She said your vote might not go through this year.
[02:34:40.129 --> 02:34:46.229]  As of today, my name is still not on the registration list, and it's not on the I voted list anywhere.
[02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:47.829]  So, bravo, Harris County.
[02:34:49.269 --> 02:34:50.090]  So there we go.
[02:34:50.190 --> 02:35:03.729]  And again, we can't, like we said, just like I couldn't confirm when we were doing the election, I believe we crossed streams in 2020, where I got a ballot to an old address in Michigan that was in process, along with, by the way, my relatives in Michigan who did vote where it said in process.
[02:35:04.250 --> 02:35:08.069]  The only confirmation that we have right now is a complete lack of confirmation.
[02:35:08.290 --> 02:35:14.489]  And to me, this is an example of, hey, Donald Trump may win this in spite of some shenanigans that are taking place.
[02:35:14.629 --> 02:35:15.809]  Let me add to that.
[02:35:17.379 --> 02:35:27.379]  Let me add to that, because, I mean, it's confirmed reports in all the battleground states, and it's almost only happening to Republicans, just like MTG on my show two weeks ago said.
[02:35:27.379 --> 02:35:30.399]  She's getting constituents saying the machines are flipping from straight Republican to straight Democrat.
[02:35:30.639 --> 02:35:32.219]  And then later, it happened all over the country.
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:33.159]  They said, oh, it's just a glitch.
[02:35:33.159 --> 02:35:33.799]  It is happening.
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:48.860]  We're good to go.
[02:35:54.829 --> 02:35:58.209]  We're good to go.
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:11.219]  Virginia, okay, the illegals do have to come off the rolls.
[02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:16.040]  So people have been denying that, even though, you know, James O'Keefe gets the footage of it happening.
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:17.739]  No, this is really going on.
[02:36:17.899 --> 02:36:20.520]  So regardless of what happens with this election, I believe Trump's about to win.
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.420]  That's what it looks like right now.
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:24.059]  It's been just the mask is off here.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:27.020]  And so much of the fraud did get caught.
[02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:33.760]  And a lot of states took off, you know, just in the aggregate, millions and millions of dead people and illegals and crazy stuff.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:43.510]  And as you know, Michigan, 500,000 people that weren't on the voter rolls and weren't voters and registered in the database, but they're just there and they get to still vote.
[02:36:43.889 --> 02:36:45.989]  I mean, so this is wild.
[02:36:46.250 --> 02:36:47.069]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:48.610]  Yeah.
[02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:54.010]  And even if, you know, as we've called Georgia for Donald Trump, like you said, Michigan is one of those.
[02:36:54.129 --> 02:37:02.209]  I mean, we already know, look, like you just said, there were voter rolls that had some, I don't remember exactly if it was redundant votes or they had non-citizens or voter rolls that should have been purged that they didn't purge.
[02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:08.629]  But we do know that at least one Chinese national voted, even though they weren't a citizen, got caught, but that vote still counts.
[02:37:08.930 --> 02:37:09.790]  To me, that's enough.
[02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:30.149]  In other words, if there are any I'm pissed.
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:38.799]  But the good news is, I mean, remember, they just stonewalled four years ago, and the judges said, well, we can't look at it, you don't have standing.
[02:37:38.899 --> 02:37:40.700]  And the media went, oh, the judges found no fraud.
[02:37:40.799 --> 02:37:41.840]  No, no judge would look at it.
[02:37:41.899 --> 02:37:51.120]  But the Republicans, under Trump's leadership, went from no coverage and looking at fraud to doing a great job with, you know, Laura Trump and people.
[02:37:51.319 --> 02:37:53.600]  And so now there's some real, you know...
[02:37:53.639 --> 02:38:05.319]  We're good to go.
[02:38:09.430 --> 02:38:10.250]  We can't do it here.
[02:38:10.329 --> 02:38:12.950]  Remember, we almost always have the election the night or the day after.
[02:38:13.149 --> 02:38:15.250]  Now we're told the new normal is weeks and weeks and weeks.
[02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:16.950]  So we're going to see some shenanigans.
[02:38:17.090 --> 02:38:18.569]  The deep state's not going to go away quietly.
[02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:21.709]  So this is certainly not a boring time to be alive.
[02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:31.510]  Or if Trump does get in, in the 76 days when he's president-elect, the left has said they're going to just go crazy and cause all sorts of uprisings.
[02:38:31.950 --> 02:38:35.209]  And that if Trump tries to defend against it, well, he's Hitler.
[02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:40.250]  So this is definitely a very exciting and dangerous time.
[02:38:41.309 --> 02:38:48.969]  Wait, do you mean to tell me that when you had a Romney who was heading up the Republican Party that it was feckless and useless and now that Donald Trump has been...
[02:38:48.969 --> 02:38:52.909]  We're actually seeing some headway being made as it relates to election front?
[02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:54.409]  That's not what you're telling me, is it, Alex?
[02:38:54.809 --> 02:38:55.969]  It's what's happening, brother.
[02:38:56.190 --> 02:38:57.510]  And so this is the great awakening.
[02:38:57.930 --> 02:39:03.170]  I mean, the only way we would lose is not engaging them because even if they steal it, now they're even double-caught.
[02:39:03.389 --> 02:39:08.950]  I mean, at a sick level, I hope this doesn't happen, but from a Machiavellian position, if they steal this now...
[02:39:09.690 --> 02:39:13.889]  I mean, the Democratic Party in a couple years will be outlawed in this country.
[02:39:14.190 --> 02:39:16.690]  I mean, they're like the Nazi Party already at this point.
[02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:18.250]  It should be.
[02:39:18.489 --> 02:39:19.909]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:21.930]  And I do have a couple more questions for you, Alex.
[02:39:22.069 --> 02:39:23.590]  First, is that shirt velvet?
[02:39:23.809 --> 02:39:24.569]  Is that velvet?
[02:39:25.430 --> 02:39:25.790]  No.
[02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:27.090]  Or is it suede?
[02:39:27.229 --> 02:39:27.870]  It looks nice.
[02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.389]  Either way.
[02:39:28.510 --> 02:39:29.090]  It looks comfortable, yeah.
[02:39:29.209 --> 02:39:29.729]  Is it velvet?
[02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:31.569]  No, it's not velvet.
[02:39:31.729 --> 02:39:33.329]  I don't own any velvet clothing.
[02:39:35.079 --> 02:39:35.959]  Well, you should.
[02:39:36.459 --> 02:39:39.899]  Because I always tell people, you know, Alex Jones is far more cuddly than you would know.
[02:39:39.979 --> 02:39:41.139]  He's a sweetheart in real life.
[02:39:41.139 --> 02:39:45.100]  And if you drape that in some velour, I won't be able to keep my hands off you.
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:45.600]  No, I get it.
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:46.120]  I love it.
[02:39:46.299 --> 02:39:50.239]  Steven, you've got like a brawny, you can be on a brawny package like a lumberjack.
[02:39:50.379 --> 02:39:52.420]  You're a brawny man there.
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:55.440]  And I'm kind of, hey, man, you know, hey, ladies, you know.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.100]  You got the, yeah.
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:59.479]  I mean, you know.
[02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:00.120]  Wait a second.
[02:40:00.399 --> 02:40:00.799]  Wait a second.
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:01.500]  Let me see this, Alex.
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:02.040]  I always do this every once in a while.
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:03.620]  You want me to, here we go, here we go.
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:04.600]  Is that what you're wanting to see?
[02:40:05.079 --> 02:40:06.139]  Hold on a second.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.959]  His chest hair literally grows like an arrow saying, right here!
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:13.059]  Is what you're wanting to look at?
[02:40:13.059 --> 02:40:13.680]  It's an arrow!
[02:40:13.819 --> 02:40:14.379]  Oh my God!
[02:40:15.299 --> 02:40:16.879]  This is gonna go back and back.
[02:40:17.979 --> 02:40:19.879]  He's got a WWE voice.
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:20.479]  Yes, he does.
[02:40:20.659 --> 02:40:21.180]  He's got the physique.
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:22.379]  And he has an actual arrow.
[02:40:22.379 --> 02:40:23.440]  Tell you what, brother.
[02:40:23.719 --> 02:40:25.319]  Donald Trump's gonna win.
[02:40:25.959 --> 02:40:26.940]  I'll tell you what, brother.
[02:40:27.059 --> 02:40:27.420]  I'll tell you what, brother.
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:28.239]  I'll tell you what.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:29.100]  George the Animal Steel.
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:33.399]  Your body hair naturally grows like sandbags, for God's sake.
[02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:37.670]  By the way, this is the least strange thing Alex Jones has ever done.
[02:40:37.850 --> 02:40:38.610]  Let me get it plugged in here.
[02:40:39.010 --> 02:40:40.290]  This is going to go mega viral.
[02:40:41.209 --> 02:40:44.049]  You can't clip it on your skin, Alex.
[02:40:44.209 --> 02:40:45.610]  He's like, look at that.
[02:40:46.909 --> 02:40:49.010]  Alex, if you got it, flaunt it.
[02:40:49.090 --> 02:40:49.629]  Show it off.
[02:40:49.809 --> 02:40:54.870]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:59.149]  Look at you.
[02:40:59.290 --> 02:40:59.729]  Good for you.
[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:04.110]  Honestly, I thought it was velvet before you took off your shirt.
[02:41:04.549 --> 02:41:08.030]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[02:41:08.250 --> 02:41:10.850]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:11.729]  I'm still not in shape.
[02:41:12.709 --> 02:41:14.030]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[02:41:14.170 --> 02:41:15.129]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[02:41:15.149 --> 02:41:16.049]  I'm not going to buy that shit.
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:19.479]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[02:41:21.559 --> 02:41:24.180]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:27.139]  I'm working out seven days a week.
[02:41:27.659 --> 02:41:28.680]  It'll be announced soon.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:30.899]  There's a big documentary film for Netflix being made.
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:35.549]  And my buddy said, hey man, Why don't we get you a really good personal trainer, former Navy SEAL guy?
[02:41:35.569 --> 02:41:36.930]  I know who the guy is for years.
[02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:38.510]  I love Sean.
[02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:41.450]  And he works for some other folks around here in town.
[02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:42.090]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:44.069]  Let's just say he's been hanging out with Joe Rogan and Elon Musk all week.
[02:41:44.569 --> 02:41:47.690]  And Joe kind of interceded and said, hey, you need to do this.
[02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:48.409]  You need to lose weight.
[02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:51.629]  And so I kind of worked with some of his guys.
[02:41:51.989 --> 02:41:55.690]  And so I'm working out seven days a week, peer pressure with a former Navy SEAL coach.
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:00.860]  You know, drill sergeant literally does Navy SEAL training at the Navy SEAL base.
[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:11.139]  He's nice about it, but he makes me, you know, I mean, I was in terrible shape, probably about to die, and then now I'm just in decent shape, but I'm going to really get in great shape.
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:12.459]  But, yeah.
[02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:14.569]  Look great.
[02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:15.090]  Look great.
[02:42:15.209 --> 02:42:15.510]  You know what though?
[02:42:15.649 --> 02:42:17.489]  Even the thing is, you still have that broad chest.
[02:42:17.549 --> 02:42:22.989]  I always say, like, Alex Jones looks like, the way is, he looks like the barrel that people go over the waterfalls in.
[02:42:23.209 --> 02:42:24.090]  But that's the kind of thing.
[02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:26.569]  I mean, this is muscle.
[02:42:26.709 --> 02:42:28.569]  These aren't, you know, it's not, it's not tits.
[02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:30.270]  So I mean, but there's going to be...
[02:42:31.649 --> 02:42:34.850]  I mean, when I used to work out a lot when I was younger, I had just ridiculous chest.
[02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:36.909]  But, yeah, I mean, we're giving everybody what they want right now.
[02:42:36.989 --> 02:42:37.530]  No, I'm not saying it's tits.
[02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:40.770]  I'm saying you look like you're made of wooden planks, right?
[02:42:40.809 --> 02:42:41.649]  You've got that barrel.
[02:42:41.649 --> 02:42:43.670]  He looks like a Coke machine with a head on it.
[02:42:43.729 --> 02:42:44.250]  Yes, he does.
[02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:45.889]  I wasn't saying that.
[02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:47.729]  The 1920s bodybuilders that are just...
[02:42:47.729 --> 02:42:56.190]  Yes, the 1920s bodybuilders, before they were juiced out of their minds, they're just like, look, I built my physique by breaking the chains in my prison walls.
[02:42:56.489 --> 02:42:57.030]  Ka-pah!
[02:42:57.219 --> 02:43:00.000]  You know what I'm doing is I'm trying to get small.
[02:43:00.399 --> 02:43:17.979]  So, I mean, mainly what I do is like just hundreds and hundreds of setups, hundreds and hundreds of, you know, burpees and all this other stuff and just pushing a sled and, you know, carrying 50-pound kettlebells in each hand,
[02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:21.079]  you know, around warehouses.
[02:43:21.379 --> 02:43:25.159]  So Rocky IV. Yeah, it's all good stuff, but I'm still in terrible shape.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:28.100]  The point is, I'm going to get in bad-ass shape.
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:29.360]  This is less than 70 days.
[02:43:29.379 --> 02:43:30.239]  You're not in terrible shape.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  Alex, take the win.
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:33.899]  Everyone here, we have some ladies.
[02:43:35.079 --> 02:43:36.700]  They're fanning themselves right now.
[02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:42.620]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the Ultimate Seafood.
[02:43:42.719 --> 02:43:43.520]  That's why, right here.
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:49.340]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[02:43:49.399 --> 02:43:51.139]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:53.100]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:43:55.469 --> 02:43:56.129]  Hey, you know what?
[02:43:56.270 --> 02:44:07.010]  Actually, Alex, if you want, and this is completely impromptu, but, you know, we just got a sponsorship from Jack and Fitness where they do home gyms, and it's one of the very rare sponsors where they reached out and I said, I know exactly who those people are.
[02:44:07.489 --> 02:44:13.709]  Lifetime warranty, and we might be able to get you one because I know you probably have a gym at your studio, but if you want one for the house, I bet you we can hook that up for you.
[02:44:13.850 --> 02:44:14.809]  It's really good stuff.
[02:44:15.090 --> 02:44:15.750]  Sounds good.
[02:44:18.049 --> 02:44:20.110]  If I were him, I would never be in my house.
[02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:22.430]  I would be outside strutting it.
[02:44:23.530 --> 02:44:25.790]  You're in way better shape than me, Crowder.
[02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:26.950]  I'm just having some fun here with you.
[02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:28.290]  Yeah, but you know what, Alex?
[02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:29.629]  I'm not just saying it.
[02:44:29.770 --> 02:44:31.049]  Very proud of you, man, because I know.
[02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.989]  And you know what?
[02:44:32.069 --> 02:44:37.370]  One thing I will say about Alex, God said, and I'm not saying God loves Alex Jones more than the rest of you.
[02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:40.930]  What I'm saying is, God did say that David is a man after his own heart.
[02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:42.049]  And people go, how could that be David?
[02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:43.610]  I mean, David basically killed a guy, David.
[02:44:43.850 --> 02:44:45.590]  But it was a man who had a repentant heart.
[02:44:45.649 --> 02:44:46.790]  It was a man who always came back to God.
[02:44:46.850 --> 02:44:52.850]  And I would tell you, Alex Jones, every time he's been going through some stuff, and I talk to Alex, he goes, you know what, I'm doing this, but...
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.239]  You know, I really need to spend more time in prayer with God, and I really want to get in.
[02:44:56.379 --> 02:44:59.159]  I know that health was a big thing where you said, you know, you would say, you know what?
[02:44:59.299 --> 02:45:00.620]  I got to get back in shape.
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:01.420]  It's just been so stressful.
[02:45:01.479 --> 02:45:02.020]  And you know what, man?
[02:45:02.219 --> 02:45:06.799]  You had the biggest lawsuit in modern American history as far as a bullshit ruling.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:07.500]  So, you know what?
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:08.879]  You had plenty of reasons to be stressed.
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:12.440]  So, hey, I know you have more goals to go, but, man, you should be proud of yourself.
[02:45:12.479 --> 02:45:13.459]  And I'm not just saying that.
[02:45:13.659 --> 02:45:14.360]  You really are.
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:15.079]  You're looking good.
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:16.059]  You're doing well.
[02:45:16.139 --> 02:45:17.620]  It's a great way to handle the stress, too.
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:19.120]  I mean, this is keeping them alive.
[02:45:19.319 --> 02:45:19.899]  Eat sea moss.
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:20.239]  Yeah.
[02:45:21.350 --> 02:45:23.649]  I'm telling you, CMOS is amazing.
[02:45:25.129 --> 02:45:26.829]  At the bottom of a boat?
[02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:31.030]  It's Irish CMOS. Listen, I just go with whatever that...
[02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:39.010]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the CMOS, and I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next to...
[02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:46.110]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court, but we'll continue on in the year one way or another working with great folks.
[02:45:46.250 --> 02:45:48.430]  So, yeah, it's just emblematic of the tyranny we're under.
[02:45:48.549 --> 02:45:53.250]  Just like Elon Musk said on Rogan, he said he could You know, if Kamala gets in, he's going to be shut down.
[02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:53.829]  This isn't a game.
[02:45:53.909 --> 02:45:54.750]  They've tried to shut you down.
[02:45:54.909 --> 02:45:59.430]  So, you know, we joke around and stuff, and I torture people looking at my, you know, because you made jokes about the shirts.
[02:45:59.450 --> 02:46:00.770]  I thought I'd go really crazy on air.
[02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:02.290]  But, I mean, this is a war.
[02:46:02.409 --> 02:46:03.190]  This is a real deal.
[02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:05.290]  So, I hope Trump wins today.
[02:46:05.690 --> 02:46:07.030]  You know, what are you predicting, Crowder?
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.000]  I think he is going to win.
[02:46:10.159 --> 02:46:11.319]  I think it's going to be very close.
[02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:12.360]  We called Georgia.
[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:14.500]  I think we'll be making the call of North Carolina quite soon.
[02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:16.260]  I think that...
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:19.659]  Oh, I'm getting word now that we are going to be calling North Carolina in just a minute.
[02:46:20.559 --> 02:46:21.219]  Actually, you know what?
[02:46:21.299 --> 02:46:25.620]  Hey, before we continue, do you want to be here for us to call North Carolina with you right now with us?
[02:46:25.719 --> 02:46:26.059]  I do.
[02:46:26.159 --> 02:46:28.239]  I should probably put my shirt back on so you guys...
[02:46:28.239 --> 02:46:28.659]  No, no, no.
[02:46:28.719 --> 02:46:29.239]  Keep your shirt off.
[02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:30.879]  Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me.
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:33.559]  Alex, you haven't seen the entirety of the show.
[02:46:33.719 --> 02:46:34.360]  It gets weirder.
[02:46:34.799 --> 02:46:36.040]  So, you're going to be able to...
[02:46:37.809 --> 02:46:38.209]  Hold on.
[02:46:38.549 --> 02:46:40.510]  Yes, I'll give a program for this one.
[02:46:40.610 --> 02:46:47.290]  So let's we're gonna give you a program because I right am I right we're gonna call so right now it's time for another state call and then yeah.
[02:46:52.770 --> 02:47:02.610]  Brought to you by Noble Gold and as we've been doing all night of course we have Donald Trump the next president who is here to call the state of North Carolina.
[02:47:30.329 --> 02:47:33.530]  And the best part is we were really excited about it and Alex Jones is gone.
[02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:40.629]  We're going too far for Alex Jones.
[02:47:40.649 --> 02:47:41.610]  Maybe he went to watch it.
[02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:42.870]  Maybe he didn't have a return monitor.
[02:47:43.229 --> 02:47:47.790]  Maybe that's the point where, you know, maybe it's like, hey, maybe we did that to be funny.
[02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:50.930]  Listen, we feel pretty confident in this according to our projections.
[02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:51.969]  I can't be associated with this.
[02:47:52.049 --> 02:47:52.770]  These people are crazy.
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.440]  I just saw an intern walk by.
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:57.360]  Like, no, no, no.
[02:47:57.639 --> 02:47:59.319]  Alex, he's probably not doing push-ups.
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:47:59.899]  He is.
[02:47:59.979 --> 02:48:01.100]  I was doing burpees, Steven.
[02:48:01.239 --> 02:48:01.500]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:03.079]  I was doing burpees as part of my program.
[02:48:03.079 --> 02:48:04.520]  Eating some moss off my garage wall.
[02:48:04.719 --> 02:48:05.760]  I drank too much tap water.
[02:48:05.879 --> 02:48:06.159]  That's right.
[02:48:06.299 --> 02:48:07.540]  I felt a little gay.
[02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:12.780]  According to our projections, he's going to win North Carolina by around 2.8%.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.040]  By around 2.8%.
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:14.600]  That's not enough for me.
[02:48:14.799 --> 02:48:17.479]  Which honestly is pretty in line.
[02:48:17.559 --> 02:48:18.719]  Can someone bring up the RCP average?
[02:48:18.739 --> 02:48:21.079]  I think it was somewhere around 1.8%.
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:22.479]  I don't remember the exact number.
[02:48:22.639 --> 02:48:23.299]  We can bring that up.
[02:48:23.399 --> 02:48:26.239]  But I wanted to give you a couple other pieces of information as we've been talking about.
[02:48:26.239 --> 02:48:26.680]  Hold on one second.
[02:48:26.819 --> 02:48:28.799]  Did you see North Carolina called, Alex?
[02:48:29.899 --> 02:48:30.719]  Did you get to see?
[02:48:31.319 --> 02:48:32.420]  Yes, I saw it.
[02:48:34.159 --> 02:48:36.059]  I didn't know where you went.
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:37.639]  I was like, oh man, we lost Alex.
[02:48:38.639 --> 02:48:41.100]  Well, I've got a chamber pot over there.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:42.079]  I just went and took a dump.
[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:47.000]  You know that's what the Democrats are doing right now.
[02:48:48.190 --> 02:48:49.510]  Yes, I do believe they are.
[02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:50.510]  Well, they're hanging in their pants.
[02:48:50.649 --> 02:48:52.069]  Stephen's got a crock pot next to him.
[02:48:52.069 --> 02:48:52.489]  Yes, I do.
[02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:54.729]  It's actually, it's an Instapot.
[02:48:54.909 --> 02:49:02.030]  Listen, I never say this about Steve, but it's really cool because when I've co-hosted and guest-hosted for him, I like, I have the same thing here.
[02:49:02.049 --> 02:49:05.190]  He has a toilet in his chair, and it's very relaxing.
[02:49:05.350 --> 02:49:05.530]  I do.
[02:49:06.190 --> 02:49:06.709]  I do.
[02:49:06.989 --> 02:49:10.190]  And I also pee sitting down.
[02:49:11.350 --> 02:49:12.450]  Yeah, well...
[02:49:14.719 --> 02:49:17.219]  I only piece it now when I'm doing the show, and that's a convenience factor.
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:23.100]  But I did change the chair, because it used to be like that old foam chair that you have at your grandparents' house, where it feels like another butt up against your butt.
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:26.040]  So now it's actually just, it's a nice, firm polymer.
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:27.100]  So you don't get that.
[02:49:27.159 --> 02:49:28.840]  It's like, you know, when you sit on someone else's desk.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:29.479]  No, I agree.
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:31.100]  I don't like it anymore.
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:31.579]  I'm old now.
[02:49:32.229 --> 02:49:34.149]  I don't like old people chairs, even though I'm kind of old now.
[02:49:34.270 --> 02:49:38.549]  It's weird to be 50, but I remember, like, Grandma was like, it feels creepy.
[02:49:38.930 --> 02:49:46.950]  Like, you know, this must be like this when you're, like, a junior high student and Tim Walz is your gay counselor.
[02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:48.530]  Must be what it's like to sit on his lap.
[02:49:50.290 --> 02:49:50.690]  Allegedly.
[02:49:51.010 --> 02:49:51.250]  Allegedly.
[02:49:51.389 --> 02:49:56.750]  Also, it's really weird when old people have carpeting up and around the toilets.
[02:49:56.989 --> 02:49:58.510]  You had some information there, Gerald.
[02:49:58.850 --> 02:49:59.809]  Alright, so just some information.
[02:50:00.010 --> 02:50:03.709]  So we got some PA updates that we can have Ginger Snap come in and give us some.
[02:50:04.209 --> 02:50:08.110]  Kamala Harris is way underperforming in some very important places.
[02:50:08.409 --> 02:50:12.190]  And then I just wanted to give you this update, too, on Florida.
[02:50:12.350 --> 02:50:15.229]  So in 2020, Trump won Florida by 372,000.
[02:50:15.350 --> 02:50:18.370]  Right now it's projected at over 1.5 million votes.
[02:50:19.299 --> 02:50:21.700]  He's going to win it by this time around.
[02:50:21.879 --> 02:50:22.479]  Stop it, Nick!
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:23.719]  What do you mean, Nick?
[02:50:24.819 --> 02:50:26.600]  You and your trend horse shit.
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:33.299]  There's been no good news tonight that Nick hasn't said anything.
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:34.319]  By the way, real quick.
[02:50:34.399 --> 02:50:35.319]  Hey, real quick.
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:36.379]  We're going to lose Florida.
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.059]  Real quick, Crowder.
[02:50:38.139 --> 02:50:39.120]  Gerald, you can't quit.
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:40.840]  Gerald, you cannot quit.
[02:50:41.020 --> 02:50:42.459]  Hey, no making out with Nick.
[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:43.559]  Stop it.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:44.180]  Stop it.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:45.799]  Don't hurt me.
[02:50:46.139 --> 02:50:47.620]  Hey, Steven, something big here.
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:49.299]  Steven, something...
[02:50:49.299 --> 02:50:50.600]  Don't make me take my shirt off!
[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:54.280]  You mean aside from an Aryan beating up a Sicilian, which the optics are not great yet?
[02:50:54.479 --> 02:50:55.079]  What is it, Alex?
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:58.399]  Listen, you guys are doing great on the numbers as well.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.399]  I know you love Owen Schroyer, former political prisoner.
[02:51:01.739 --> 02:51:04.399]  He's in our big map room looking at some of the numbers.
[02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:07.739]  I want to get his, just for a minute or so, his take and analysis.
[02:51:07.979 --> 02:51:09.280]  I know you've got a bunch of experts there.
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:11.680]  Let's put our brains together right now.
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:13.420]  But let's just go to Owen for a second, Assemblecast.
[02:51:13.559 --> 02:51:14.799]  I want him to give us a quick report.
[02:51:14.799 --> 02:51:15.639]  He says big developments.
[02:51:15.879 --> 02:51:16.200]  Owen...
[02:51:17.559 --> 02:51:18.180]  Here's the deal.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:20.459]  Where's the best place for people to find you?
[02:51:20.479 --> 02:51:22.180]  I just want to say, where's the best place for people to find you?
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:23.280]  Because we didn't get your plug-in yet.
[02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:24.620]  Sorry, we have Joe Lewis in the studio.
[02:51:25.079 --> 02:51:26.020]  I'm gonna steal your dog.
[02:51:27.470 --> 02:51:43.750]  If InfoWars gets shut down, find me at realalexjonesonx, find me at alexjones.network, and also follow our backup channel at AJN for, you know, Alex Jones Network, AJN Live, and that'll be a big deal because, you know, when I got deplatformed, even great fans had trouble finding me.
[02:51:43.909 --> 02:51:48.110]  We're showing a lot of talk radio stations, and we've got the uplinks at the new studio and stuff, but it's a lot smaller.
[02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:52.170]  We tend to expand and hopefully, you know, move out of Austin, maybe up north by you guys.
[02:51:52.250 --> 02:51:52.610]  Who knows?
[02:51:53.629 --> 02:51:54.690]  You know what, Alex, too?
[02:51:54.809 --> 02:51:56.250]  Also, I don't know if you noticed, we just announced this tonight.
[02:51:56.409 --> 02:51:58.930]  You know, Rumble Premium has been an ad-free service that's been around for a while.
[02:51:59.030 --> 02:52:00.549]  Mug Club now is Rumble Premium.
[02:52:00.690 --> 02:52:06.450]  Rumble Premium is Mug Club, where Mug Club proved that we could build out a network, but there are already more people like Donald Trump Jr.
[02:52:06.709 --> 02:52:07.209]  on Rumble Premium.
[02:52:07.329 --> 02:52:08.229]  They have some gamers there.
[02:52:08.350 --> 02:52:09.510]  No, I've been talking to the owners!
[02:52:09.610 --> 02:52:12.690]  I've been talking to the head of Rumble with you guys as well.
[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:14.670]  We're going to be working a lot more with Rumble regardless.
[02:52:14.969 --> 02:52:16.750]  I just got to know what's going to happen with M4s, but we're finally here.
[02:52:17.069 --> 02:52:21.770]  It'll be gone next Tuesday, and bad guys are probably going to buy it.
[02:52:21.909 --> 02:52:27.930]  So I've just been faithful to the crew here, but I'm ready to branch out and hopefully have the crew with me.
[02:52:28.270 --> 02:52:29.270]  But that's going on today.
[02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:35.940]  And you could always just bring, you could just change it to like info floors and that could be under Rumble Premium is my point, right?
[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:37.659]  There's a million things that you could do.
[02:52:37.819 --> 02:52:38.899]  Oh no, we lost his feet.
[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:40.379]  Don or just dark?
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:46.059]  No, I'm here and if people want to support me because it takes money to fight this, thealexjohnstore.com.
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:48.520]  Yes, alexjonesstore.com.
[02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:52.620]  I think because he wants to feed us some info from Owen Schroyer real quick.
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:54.260]  And the Alex Jones...
[02:52:54.260 --> 02:52:55.219]  Sorry, say it again, Alex.
[02:52:55.979 --> 02:52:56.680]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:52:59.260]  Get some t-shirts, get some CMOS. Keep us on the air.
[02:52:59.360 --> 02:52:59.719]  I'm not kidding.
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.899]  You'll love the CMOS. But seriously, Owen is on it.
[02:53:01.979 --> 02:53:03.260]  I know you guys have your own war room.
[02:53:03.459 --> 02:53:05.440]  I want to hear your take on his analysis.
[02:53:05.799 --> 02:53:07.239]  So here's Owen Schroyer.
[02:53:07.340 --> 02:53:07.940]  Owen, come in here.
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:10.459]  All right, everybody take a deep breath.
[02:53:11.239 --> 02:53:12.799]  Everybody just relax for a second.
[02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:14.780]  We got election happening right now.
[02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:19.559]  The numbers in Pennsylvania and Georgia, in my view, I've crunched them.
[02:53:19.719 --> 02:53:21.079]  There's no path to victory.
[02:53:21.379 --> 02:53:23.299]  82% in Pennsylvania.
[02:53:23.559 --> 02:53:27.940]  Harris would have to get 65% of the vote the rest of the way.
[02:53:28.079 --> 02:53:29.500]  It's just not there.
[02:53:29.659 --> 02:53:32.200]  The rural counties are competing with Philadelphia.
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:35.440]  She's not gonna get 65% the rest of the way.
[02:53:36.450 --> 02:53:39.010]  And I just don't see why they just don't call it now.
[02:53:39.229 --> 02:53:42.049]  I'm telling you, Trump needs to come out and declare victory right now.
[02:53:42.409 --> 02:53:47.450]  Harris has not been getting 65% of the returns since 8 p.m.
[02:53:47.709 --> 02:53:48.770]  It's not happening.
[02:53:49.469 --> 02:53:53.549]  Trump is going to win Pennsylvania aside from shenanigans.
[02:53:53.729 --> 02:53:55.549]  Same thing happening in Georgia.
[02:53:56.209 --> 02:53:57.010]  Pull up Georgia.
[02:53:57.950 --> 02:54:04.879]  Harris at this point Look, Biden won Georgia by 12,000 votes.
[02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:09.500]  Trump won Georgia by less than 100,000 in 2016.
[02:54:09.879 --> 02:54:13.159]  These are better returns than both of those elections.
[02:54:13.459 --> 02:54:22.760]  There is no way Harris can come back from over 100,000 votes down, except ridiculous shenanigans, with 91% in.
[02:54:22.979 --> 02:54:23.920]  Think about that.
[02:54:24.079 --> 02:54:27.079]  What is she gonna get, 75% of the last 10% vote?
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.659]  Not gonna happen, not an unfair election.
[02:54:29.860 --> 02:54:31.319]  So we zoom back out.
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:32.280]  What does this mean?
[02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:39.260]  This means with Pennsylvania and Georgia and Nebraska, that's 270.
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:41.659]  That's a victory for Donald Trump.
[02:54:41.819 --> 02:54:44.459]  He needs to come out in 15 minutes and declare victory.
[02:54:44.909 --> 02:54:46.270]  I'll let him declare it.
[02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:50.329]  I won't be the one to declare victory, but that's what we see here on this map.
[02:54:50.690 --> 02:54:51.690]  All right, Owen, stay there.
[02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:52.309]  I want to go back.
[02:54:52.409 --> 02:54:54.190]  Hold on, because we're breaking in with Stephen here.
[02:54:54.569 --> 02:54:57.090]  Stephen, I want to get your take, because you guys are looking at the numbers.
[02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:58.629]  You've got experts there as well.
[02:54:58.770 --> 02:54:59.190]  Owen, stay there.
[02:54:59.270 --> 02:54:59.569]  Don't go.
[02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:01.670]  What is your take on what Owen just said?
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:05.920]  Okay, well, one second, because we were just having some issues here.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:06.559]  I wanted to bring it up.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:08.680]  We've talked about that before.
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:10.399]  So, you know, we have called Georgia.
[02:55:10.559 --> 02:55:11.719]  So Owen is right on that.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.420]  We've called Georgia pretty definitively.
[02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:14.540]  We're very confident in Georgia.
[02:55:14.659 --> 02:55:17.559]  We do have laying the brain in here with some updates in Pennsylvania.
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:19.379]  And I think there's some agreement.
[02:55:19.459 --> 02:55:21.860]  And then you have a little bit more context to some of those numbers.
[02:55:22.180 --> 02:55:23.299]  And I don't know if there's disagreement.
[02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:25.680]  No, there's no disagreement at all, really.
[02:55:25.819 --> 02:55:28.739]  The only difference is the map that we had on our website.
[02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:29.540]  Yes.
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:30.940]  We actually call Georgia.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:31.399]  Right.
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:37.680]  So the only thing left for Trump to do is win one of those upper Midwest states, Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.379]  So let's bring up there, Noodles, the election integrity map, because we have called Georgia so people can see that.
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:43.340]  Oh, is it DDoS again?
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:43.940]  It's still DDoS.
[02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:44.579]  It's DDoS.
[02:55:44.639 --> 02:55:47.020]  We've been DDoS attacked because, Alex, we've been providing this analysis.
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:48.600]  The longest one in history, by the way.
[02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:51.260]  According to him, he has Pennsylvania.
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:52.659]  Well, I know, according to what he just said.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:56:09.120]  So we cannot say that, yet we are not really willing to say that Pennsylvania, we are not willing to say that, but to reflect on what he said with those trends, how he said she needs 65% of the vote, if you want to pull up what our analysts just put together, that graph, this will kind of help show what Owen was talking about,
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.120]  because it reflects exactly what our numbers are saying today.
[02:56:12.149 --> 02:56:12.309]  Great.
[02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:12.909]  So there you go.
[02:56:12.989 --> 02:56:15.709]  So Alex, we actually have a graph that I don't know if you guys can see it on your program.
[02:56:15.809 --> 02:56:16.430]  You may not be able to.
[02:56:16.629 --> 02:56:17.030]  Pull it back down.
[02:56:17.149 --> 02:56:24.709]  But we've had some graphs here that we're actually able to present to people as far as what percentage of the vote needs to be won in the future.
[02:56:25.090 --> 02:56:26.469]  So let's bring up that.
[02:56:26.629 --> 02:56:27.569]  You want to bring up that graph?
[02:56:27.850 --> 02:56:29.049]  I'll get it to him right now.
[02:56:29.149 --> 02:56:30.809]  But everything that Owen just said checks out.
[02:56:31.170 --> 02:56:31.450]  Gotcha.
[02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:33.709]  And that's why we actually called Georgia.
[02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:34.110]  Right there.
[02:56:34.219 --> 02:56:34.920]  Not that long ago.
[02:56:35.059 --> 02:56:35.680]  Let's bring this up.
[02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:36.239]  You have it there?
[02:56:36.239 --> 02:56:36.920]  Yeah, we've got it.
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:37.819]  Okay, so Pennsylvania.
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:39.399]  So I don't know if you can see this, Alex.
[02:56:39.479 --> 02:56:39.719]  We can.
[02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:43.840]  But laying the brain, describe this because we've been showing this throughout the night.
[02:56:43.979 --> 02:56:48.719]  Describe it for some new viewers, people coming in from Alex's show who may not be familiar with this metric that you've shown.
[02:56:48.719 --> 02:56:48.899]  Correct.
[02:56:49.059 --> 02:56:52.299]  So this is essentially reflecting the sentiment that they were just talking about.
[02:56:52.479 --> 02:56:58.159]  If you look at the red bar, so the farthest to the right is actually the most recent information that we have.
[02:56:58.260 --> 02:56:59.459]  And it says 54.2.
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:01.100]  And by information, you mean the most recent vote dump.
[02:57:01.209 --> 02:57:01.649]  Yes, correct.
[02:57:02.010 --> 02:57:07.110]  So the most recent vote dump, Donald Trump collected 54.2% of that.
[02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:18.110]  And what that tells us is of the outstanding vote remaining, he only needs to win 45, which means Kamala Harris would need to win about 55% of that vote.
[02:57:18.250 --> 02:57:21.829]  So our percentages are a little different, but the trend is exactly the same.
[02:57:21.909 --> 02:57:29.590]  And you are pretty, again, we're not making the call, but pretty confident that it's very unlikely with the votes that are remaining in Pennsylvania that she would be reaching those margins.
[02:57:29.930 --> 02:57:30.290]  Correct.
[02:57:30.649 --> 02:57:41.510]  And the reason that we feel a little confident in Pennsylvania, not in calling it, but in the direction it's going, is if there's two bellwether counties, essentially, that you want to look at, which are Erie County and Northampton County.
[02:57:42.180 --> 02:57:48.879]  And in the last vote dump, Donald Trump closed the gap in Erie County by about 7%, and he's only trailing by 3.6% now.
[02:57:48.979 --> 02:57:50.079]  So he keeps making that up.
[02:57:50.219 --> 02:57:58.879]  But Northampton County is the one you want to look at, because he actually lost that by 0.7% in 2020 to Joe Biden.
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.639]  But right now...
[02:58:00.639 --> 02:58:03.219]  We're looking on the map for Northampton.
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:07.239]  Yeah, can you give me a fucking rain man over here, just reading him at a million miles an hour.
[02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:09.879]  Give me a dramatic...
[02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:10.620]  Google it.
[02:58:11.389 --> 02:58:16.190]  So what we do see in Northampton is that Trump is leading by a substantial...
[02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:19.829]  He's leading by 5.4% right now at last check.
[02:58:20.129 --> 02:58:21.569]  He lost that county.
[02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:22.049]  Wow.
[02:58:22.329 --> 02:58:23.069]  Now I'm excited.
[02:58:23.450 --> 02:58:30.370]  And there's only been three times, I believe, in the last 150 years that that county hasn't predicted the winner of the state.
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:33.920]  I think 2004, 2000, and 1968.
[02:58:34.399 --> 02:58:36.879]  So it's not just the fact, Alex, to go back to that.
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:45.379]  It's not just the fact that he's doing better than in 2020, but it's the fact that that actually, in combination with that, is a bellwether county that's indicative of someone winning the country at large.
[02:58:45.559 --> 02:58:45.899]  That is correct.
[02:58:46.059 --> 02:58:47.500]  For the state, it's pretty significant.
[02:58:47.799 --> 02:58:50.200]  Seems, all metrics that we have right now, that he should win the state.
[02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:54.899]  But that microcosm within the state suggests strongly that he would win the country.
[02:58:54.979 --> 02:58:56.959]  And this is, by the way, given the fact that we've already called Georgia.
[02:58:57.219 --> 02:58:57.520]  Right.
[02:58:57.840 --> 02:59:05.159]  And then, even if you move past Pennsylvania, if you can pull up the New York Times thing that we sent you, they're starting to even not have much room to win.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:06.319]  I was going to say, they were noticing it.
[02:59:06.399 --> 02:59:09.100]  They were leaning Trump about an hour ago.
[02:59:09.159 --> 02:59:09.399]  Yes.
[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:11.420]  It was the first time they had said it in this entire cycle.
[02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:14.239]  So, they're leaning him in popular vote also.
[02:59:14.579 --> 02:59:17.719]  But they also have him up in PA, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
[02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:20.639]  They give him over a 65% chance in all of those states to win.
[02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:21.120]  Yep.
[02:59:21.520 --> 02:59:23.059]  And if he...
[02:59:23.610 --> 02:59:24.750]  Wins any of those states.
[02:59:25.049 --> 02:59:27.370]  Polymarket's at 97% for Trump now.
[02:59:27.450 --> 02:59:27.790]  Yeah, hold on.
[02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:29.250]  I wanted to do a polymarket check-in after.
[02:59:29.450 --> 02:59:29.770]  Sorry.
[02:59:30.350 --> 02:59:33.049]  Alex, Alex, there's too much.
[02:59:33.149 --> 02:59:33.450]  Hold on one second.
[02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:34.370]  Alex, are you still there?
[02:59:34.450 --> 02:59:34.989]  Did you hear the announcement?
[02:59:35.170 --> 02:59:42.209]  So, Owen was right on the money, and we have access to, again, some metrics here behind the scenes that kind of exclusive here that we can parse out.
[02:59:42.229 --> 02:59:42.569]  No, I know.
[02:59:42.670 --> 02:59:43.610]  You guys did a great job.
[02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:45.110]  Well, that's super news.
[02:59:45.290 --> 02:59:46.409]  Oh, and he's right on the money.
[02:59:47.129 --> 02:59:48.829]  So, it looks like, I mean...
[02:59:49.959 --> 02:59:53.799]  In the old days, when somebody won, they would declare so they wouldn't do shenanigans.
[02:59:53.959 --> 02:59:56.020]  I think Trump needs to declare here in the next few hours.
[02:59:57.860 --> 02:59:59.479]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:59:59.559 --> 03:00:02.000]  I think that if he wins Pennsylvania, he absolutely should declare.
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:03.200]  We're not fully...
[03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:04.579]  And if you guys are, that's great.
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:05.639]  We're not fully...
[03:00:05.639 --> 03:00:06.819]  No, no, we're not saying we're 100% right.
[03:00:06.979 --> 03:00:08.040]  We're just saying it looks like it does.
[03:00:09.350 --> 03:00:10.850]  Yeah, it certainly looks that way.
[03:00:10.969 --> 03:00:11.409]  It looks like it to me, too.
[03:00:11.549 --> 03:00:16.290]  I think, Alex, my only hesitation would be I don't want to give people like, oh, Donald Trump is cheating again.
[03:00:16.430 --> 03:00:17.950]  I just don't want that.
[03:00:18.129 --> 03:00:19.409]  They'll try and go with those optics.
[03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:21.350]  Let it become a little bit more obvious.
[03:00:21.350 --> 03:00:27.110]  I agree with you, though, to put a stop to any of the potential steal or anything that is going on to kind of head that off, but...
[03:00:27.350 --> 03:00:29.250]  I just want it to be a little bit more clear.
[03:00:29.290 --> 03:00:29.729]  One final thing.
[03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:30.889]  So, Alex, I know we're going to have to...
[03:00:30.889 --> 03:00:36.149]  Can we have our team cross-reference these counties that are particularly important right now and look at the Jewish voting population?
[03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:36.430]  Yeah.
[03:00:36.489 --> 03:00:38.090]  Because looking at the trends that we already have...
[03:00:38.090 --> 03:00:38.610]  No, no.
[03:00:38.690 --> 03:00:39.229]  I'm just saying...
[03:00:39.229 --> 03:00:48.190]  No, we can look at those in PA. In other words, we can look at those in PA, but that might help us make a prediction a little bit earlier if we see those numbers still continue to track.
[03:00:48.209 --> 03:00:49.610]  And to that point, we were able...
[03:00:49.610 --> 03:00:53.709]  When we did call North Carolina, it was about 10 minutes ahead of Reuters' call on that as well.
[03:00:53.909 --> 03:00:55.590]  So we did beat them to the punch.
[03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:56.469]  Yeah, thank you, Mug Club.
[03:00:56.670 --> 03:00:58.170]  So we're the first place right here, guys.

[03:01:06.149 --> 03:01:07.209]  I know that Alex Jones has a lot.
[03:01:07.409 --> 03:01:10.209]  We don't know what's going to happen after next week, but the water's warm.
[03:01:11.069 --> 03:01:13.629]  And, yeah, we made the North Carolina call before they did at Reuters.
[03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:14.510]  We made the Georgia call.
[03:01:14.629 --> 03:01:16.690]  I want you to stick around here for a little bit, laying the brain.
[03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:19.610]  Alex, we do have to get going, but tell Owen if he can't still hear us.
[03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:20.329]  Great work.
[03:01:20.649 --> 03:01:23.489]  And we may even be able to check in with you guys later.
[03:01:23.629 --> 03:01:26.170]  And if you have any questions, you can reach out to us behind the scenes, too.
[03:01:27.559 --> 03:01:27.959]  Absolutely.
[03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:30.100]  And just want to say, great job with your investigative team.
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:35.940]  Winning this election, you guys have done just as good as James O'Keefe, and he's always been the North Star.
[03:01:36.139 --> 03:01:36.979]  We're not in competition.
[03:01:37.139 --> 03:01:37.760]  We're all on the same team.
[03:01:37.899 --> 03:01:40.479]  But incredible job for all your supporters, everybody else.
[03:01:40.559 --> 03:01:42.219]  And I love working with you, and I love your crew.
[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:44.540]  This is a historic moment, so thank you so much.
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:46.819]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:01:46.899 --> 03:01:47.600]  We appreciate it.
[03:01:47.719 --> 03:01:49.280]  Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer, everybody.
[03:01:53.399 --> 03:01:55.059]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:56.870 --> 03:02:03.590]  My fellow Americans, people watching around the world, history is happening right now.
[03:02:03.850 --> 03:02:11.209]  We have done the numbers, we have looked at the math, and unless there's massive fraud in Pennsylvania...
[03:02:13.629 --> 03:02:17.809]  Trump is about to win the election tonight, but they promise not to accept it.
[03:02:17.909 --> 03:02:22.010]  They've promised to hold it up and create civil war conditions and have violent uprisings.
[03:02:22.170 --> 03:02:23.270]  I mean, that's Jamie Raskin.
[03:02:23.370 --> 03:02:24.909]  That's James Carble.
[03:02:25.610 --> 03:02:26.909]  That's John Podesta.
[03:02:27.889 --> 03:02:33.229]  They're in the New York Times saying that while they accuse Trump of planning to use the military and martial law, while they sign executive orders for it.
[03:02:35.430 --> 03:02:36.049]  It's incredible.
[03:02:36.690 --> 03:02:39.129]  Candace Horbeck's also here riding shotgun with us.
[03:02:39.250 --> 03:02:39.870]  Popular podcast.
[03:02:40.069 --> 03:02:45.010]  We've got Owen Schroer and Harrison Smith in there at our political desk with all the latest numbers.
[03:02:45.709 --> 03:02:48.350]  And I have to say it right now.
[03:02:49.530 --> 03:02:52.389]  Trump has won this election.
[03:02:52.569 --> 03:03:00.319]  You know, we saw Fox News four years ago and it turned out to be a fraud early in the night claim that Biden the puppet had won Arizona.
[03:03:00.319 --> 03:03:01.600]  That was a lie.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:03.399]  We're not jumping the gun.
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:04.680]  The polls are closed.
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:06.420]  This isn't going to affect things.
[03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:08.219]  But we've seen massive fraud.
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:13.899]  We know in key states like Nevada, they say for three days after they're going to take non-postmark ballots.
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:14.559]  That's insane.
[03:03:14.719 --> 03:03:15.899]  We know illegals voted.
[03:03:16.059 --> 03:03:18.500]  We know unprecedented fraud they got caught in.
[03:03:18.879 --> 03:03:21.200]  But I'm going to say it right now.
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:23.579]  Trump, despite all the fraud...
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:31.659]  I think?
[03:03:42.629 --> 03:03:54.530]  99% chance Trump is the winner, and what Owen keeps saying is this, as soon as it's clear, as soon as Pennsylvania goes, he's got to declare it now, or they are going to throw it into question and supply the fraud they need in those key blue cities.
[03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:56.489]  History is happening now.
[03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:59.549]  President Trump is the winner.
[03:04:00.129 --> 03:04:05.549]  He was the winner four years ago, but this landslide was so big that the fraud did not stop it.
[03:04:06.409 --> 03:04:08.930]  And it looks like, despite all the fraud, it's still going to be a big win.
[03:04:09.329 --> 03:04:10.829]  Owen, you're doing an excellent job.
[03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:18.649]  You and Harrison lay out the latest numbers now at exactly 12 midnight Eastern, 11 p.m.
[03:04:18.770 --> 03:04:20.569]  Central, 10 p.m.
[03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:22.409]  Mountain, 9 p.m.
[03:04:22.809 --> 03:04:22.850]  Pacific.
[03:04:23.610 --> 03:04:24.469]  Owen Troyer.
[03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:28.930]  Harris and I were just discussing what you just said.
[03:04:29.629 --> 03:04:31.549]  This is 2020 all over again.
[03:04:32.090 --> 03:04:36.190]  Trump needs to come out and declare victory right now because I'm telling you, Alex, I can feel it.
[03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:40.549]  They're gonna start stuffing the ballots in Philadelphia if he doesn't declare victory.
[03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:44.129]  They're gonna start stuffing the ballots in Atlanta if he doesn't declare victory.
[03:04:44.290 --> 03:04:45.350]  It's their only hope.
[03:04:45.569 --> 03:04:47.190]  The numbers do not add up.
[03:04:47.610 --> 03:04:53.879]  Harris is now to the point Where she would have to get 70% of the remaining votes.
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:55.120]  And they're not there.
[03:04:55.399 --> 03:04:56.639]  They're just not there.
[03:04:56.799 --> 03:05:07.440]  So unless we see the final numbers in Pennsylvania, with Trump getting 3.4 and then Harris gets 3.5, which would be a fraud, it's just not there.
[03:05:07.659 --> 03:05:09.239]  And here's why I'm suspicious.
[03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:12.899]  Because we've crunched the numbers, you were just crunching the numbers before.
[03:05:14.129 --> 03:05:17.190]  Why hasn't Pennsylvania or Georgia been called for Trump?
[03:05:17.370 --> 03:05:21.030]  Fox News will not even call Pennsylvania or Georgia for Trump.
[03:05:21.690 --> 03:05:22.930]  Things are at play.
[03:05:23.309 --> 03:05:31.709]  There is no reason why these two states have not been called for Donald Trump at midnight now, past midnight Eastern, 11 o'clock Central.
[03:05:31.909 --> 03:05:33.190]  The numbers are not there.
[03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:36.709]  It could get tighter, but the numbers are not there.
[03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:42.430]  Georgia and Pennsylvania should both be declared for Trump across the media landscape.
[03:05:42.889 --> 03:05:47.190]  And the fact they're not doing it tells me they got something up their sleeve, Alex.
[03:05:47.409 --> 03:05:51.610]  And all Trump needs is Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nebraska.
[03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:52.690]  That's 270.
[03:05:53.170 --> 03:05:53.829]  It's over.
[03:05:54.069 --> 03:05:59.610]  Now, aside from that, Michigan and Wisconsin are starting to trend towards Donald Trump.
[03:05:59.889 --> 03:06:05.399]  And the Senate races Are now starting to move in the favor of Republicans.
[03:06:05.780 --> 03:06:11.500]  So now you're looking at a potential plus five in the Senate for Republicans.
[03:06:11.659 --> 03:06:14.760]  I'm telling you, major things are afoot.
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:27.360]  I hope the GOP, the RNC, Michael Watley, Laura Trump, a team of lawyers are watching what's going on in Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.
[03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:29.319]  Because this is big.
[03:06:29.520 --> 03:06:32.739]  Not only the presidential election, but the Senate seats are up as well.
[03:06:33.219 --> 03:06:34.239]  Minnesota's gone blue.
[03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:35.579]  That looks like a done deal.
[03:06:35.860 --> 03:06:41.959]  But right now, Wisconsin and Michigan are in play, and the Senate seats are in play as well.
[03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.879]  But the Senate seats we get should have Pennsylvania.
[03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:46.399]  They have declared Ohio.
[03:06:46.719 --> 03:06:48.200]  They have declared West Virginia.
[03:06:48.719 --> 03:06:49.780]  Montana looks good.
[03:06:50.479 --> 03:06:52.159]  The Republicans are taking the Senate.
[03:06:52.340 --> 03:06:53.020]  That's a done deal.
[03:06:53.219 --> 03:06:54.940]  But this is outrageous, Alex.
[03:06:55.159 --> 03:06:55.879]  This is outrageous.
[03:06:56.559 --> 03:07:10.739]  Unless Kamala Harris gets 70% of the remaining vote in Pennsylvania and 80% of the remaining vote, maybe 90 in Georgia, which is impossible, not gonna happen, not possible numbers, these states are over.
[03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:15.559]  And the fact they won't call it makes me feel like we're living 2020 all over again.
[03:07:15.799 --> 03:07:19.340]  Trump needs to come out, declare victory, put the numbers on the screen.
[03:07:19.889 --> 03:07:20.930]  What happened last time?
[03:07:21.049 --> 03:07:23.149]  After the election, we started showing the numbers.
[03:07:23.530 --> 03:07:28.309]  After the election, when nobody's watching anymore, the average American is paying attention right now.
[03:07:28.590 --> 03:07:31.850]  The average American is watching the election right now.
[03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:37.389]  Trump and his team need to come out with the same numbers that everybody has access to and say, here's the chart.
[03:07:38.020 --> 03:07:42.280]  Kamala Harris hasn't gotten 70% returns in five hours.
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:46.920]  If she gets them now, it's fraud in Georgia and in Pennsylvania.
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:51.760]  Show people the numbers, declare victory, stop this deal before it happens.
[03:07:52.079 --> 03:07:54.159]  You win Nebraska in the next hour.
[03:07:54.370 --> 03:07:55.049]  That's 270.
[03:07:55.530 --> 03:07:59.670]  I don't wanna live 2020 all over again, and then anything after that is pie.
[03:07:59.870 --> 03:08:04.149]  But you need to be watching these states as well, because these Senate seats are up as well.
[03:08:04.270 --> 03:08:11.049]  And now with returns in Arizona and Nevada coming in, I mean, the Senate could swing majorly for Republicans.
[03:08:11.049 --> 03:08:13.670]  But let's just focus on Georgia and Pennsylvania.
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:17.440]  Sorry to interrupt, but just breaking.
[03:08:17.559 --> 03:08:27.440]  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Georgia said in an evening Election Day update he believes Donald Trump will take Georgia's 16 electoral votes, saying the lead is insurmountable with the number of votes outstanding.
[03:08:27.659 --> 03:08:34.440]  So the media might not be calling Georgia, but the Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has essentially called the state for Trump.
[03:08:34.579 --> 03:08:37.139]  So that's the reason Trump could...
[03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:44.510]  It's over.
[03:08:47.270 --> 03:08:47.909]  It's over.
[03:08:48.090 --> 03:08:48.129]  Yep.
[03:08:48.430 --> 03:08:49.870]  Guys, give me Pennsylvania real quick.
[03:08:52.850 --> 03:08:54.309]  Do we have any hands back there?
[03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:57.909]  Well, nonetheless, virtually the same thing.
[03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.690]  Is this live?
[03:08:59.370 --> 03:09:02.590]  I think that was him making the statement about 15 minutes ago, I think.
[03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:07.850]  Well, the exact same phenomenon in Georgia is going on in Pennsylvania.
[03:09:08.069 --> 03:09:09.389]  The numbers are insurmountable.
[03:09:09.850 --> 03:09:12.729]  They're coming in virtually even right now.
[03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:14.309]  Really, they're coming in about even.
[03:09:14.850 --> 03:09:16.930]  Trump has a 200,000-vote lead.
[03:09:17.149 --> 03:09:25.409]  And with every vote that comes in, with every tranche of votes that come in, it lowers Harris' chances.
[03:09:25.489 --> 03:09:27.610]  I mean, they're basically 1% right now.
[03:09:29.790 --> 03:09:30.350]  Yeah.
[03:09:32.219 --> 03:09:36.319]  Okay, so again, the numbers in Georgia are simply insurmountable.
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:43.899]  This is over 100,000, as you can see here, 93%, okay?
[03:09:44.399 --> 03:09:49.020]  So Kamala Harris would now have to get 90% of the remaining votes.
[03:09:49.159 --> 03:09:55.979]  And if you go to DeKalb County, go to DeKalb County, go to Fulton County, they're just not there, folks.
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:09:57.059]  They're just not there.
[03:09:58.549 --> 03:10:01.629]  You're already 93% in Fulton.
[03:10:02.209 --> 03:10:03.430]  Now give me DeKalb.
[03:10:05.090 --> 03:10:10.049]  And DeKalb is the one they're worried about because that's a Democratic stronghold and they're taking forever to count the votes.
[03:10:10.149 --> 03:10:13.770]  But again, Brad Raffensperger, Secretary of State, just gave a statement where he said it's over.
[03:10:13.950 --> 03:10:15.110]  The numbers are not there.
[03:10:15.709 --> 03:10:17.590]  The numbers are just not there.
[03:10:17.850 --> 03:10:18.450]  There you go.
[03:10:18.610 --> 03:10:19.750]  90% in there.
[03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:22.170]  The numbers are just not there.
[03:10:22.610 --> 03:10:29.100]  So- I mean, again, they're setting the same thing up.
[03:10:29.379 --> 03:10:30.299]  Go ahead.
[03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:34.120]  All right, Owen, let me stop you for a moment.
[03:10:34.579 --> 03:10:41.040]  Brian Krasenstein, thing one, or is he thing two, Democrat Party operative, just said, Elon Musk won this for Trump.
[03:10:41.440 --> 03:10:42.239]  That's the tweet.
[03:10:42.719 --> 03:10:44.559]  Yeah, they're even beginning to capitulate.
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:46.399]  This is incredible.
[03:10:46.579 --> 03:10:51.739]  I hope they don't shoot down Trump's Trump Force One with an air service-to-air missile or something like that.
[03:10:52.239 --> 03:10:55.700]  Now we're going to see the aftermath of this, but it's coming in now.
[03:10:56.559 --> 03:11:02.659]  And so I don't see how they turn this around, Harrison and Owen, and then Candace Horbach, popular podcaster.
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:04.440]  Give us your take on this historic moment.
[03:11:04.559 --> 03:11:06.760]  I don't want to say it's 100% in the bag, but it looks like it is right now.
[03:11:06.879 --> 03:11:07.139]  I know.
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:13.280]  I don't want to celebrate too soon, but oh my gosh, a lot has changed since I took a break and came back, and it's so exciting.
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:15.860]  I'm so proud of North Carolina for going red.
[03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:25.219]  I am a tiny bit concerned that Georgia seems to have stalled a little bit, and I agree we need to call it because we don't want any shenanigans to happen.
[03:11:26.180 --> 03:11:30.180]  But yeah, I didn't see it flipping that fast with all those seats.
[03:11:30.340 --> 03:11:36.239]  We were like on the edge of our seats just like an hour and a half ago saying what was going to happen then, how much he needed to take Virginia.
[03:11:36.239 --> 03:11:37.760]  And I'm here for it.
[03:11:37.799 --> 03:11:38.440]  This is amazing.
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:45.280]  Let's go back right now, folks, to the live feed of the Harris HQ. They don't look too happy.
[03:11:45.399 --> 03:11:46.100]  Here's live footage.
[03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:53.120]  I mean, a few folks are still dancing around, but other people look really concerned right now.
[03:11:54.940 --> 03:11:55.680]  Oh my goodness.
[03:11:56.079 --> 03:11:56.760]  She's worried.
[03:11:57.059 --> 03:12:00.500]  I mean, I see a few people still, you know, let's pipe in the audio if we can.
[03:12:00.559 --> 03:12:02.180]  I guess they got music going in the background.
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:06.819]  You never see Democrats with American flags unless they try to fool people, but we got some here.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:08.979]  Still some dancing going on, but people...
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:15.979]  We love World War III. We love human smuggling.
[03:12:16.260 --> 03:12:19.840]  We love poison shots and Bill Gates, too.
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:21.959]  You will eat the bugs.
[03:12:21.979 --> 03:12:23.840]  We will sterilize you.
[03:12:24.139 --> 03:12:27.639]  We love GMO and 5G, too.
[03:12:28.139 --> 03:12:31.659]  La, la, [...] la.
[03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:41.079]  I mean, I'm sorry for these people, but these folks are just victims of the system.
[03:12:43.219 --> 03:12:45.540]  So, it doesn't look too good there.
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:47.559]  Do you think they're paid to be there, too?
[03:12:47.719 --> 03:12:48.520]  Some of them, or no?
[03:12:49.139 --> 03:12:52.180]  It came out most of the rallies were paid, or they would tell them Beyonce would be playing.
[03:12:53.079 --> 03:12:54.360]  It's just amazing.
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:55.319]  Wow.
[03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:58.139]  So, basically, it looks like Trump's won.
[03:12:59.059 --> 03:13:03.920]  So, Fox declared that Biden won just to steal it.
[03:13:05.819 --> 03:13:08.680]  So, I'll just declare that Trump has won the 2024 election.
[03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:10.940]  I mean, one of the Krasnesteens already has.
[03:13:11.059 --> 03:13:11.559]  It's clear.
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:14.200]  But I am concerned what Owen and Harrison were just saying.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:20.120]  If Trump doesn't get out as soon as Pennsylvania goes, they're just going to keep it going for weeks and then magically supply what they need.
[03:13:20.159 --> 03:13:20.500]  What do you think?
[03:13:20.639 --> 03:13:21.319]  I agree, yeah.
[03:13:21.379 --> 03:13:22.860]  I think that he needs to come out and call it.
[03:13:23.139 --> 03:13:24.059]  Yeah, that and Georgia.
[03:13:25.270 --> 03:13:29.750]  All right, well, we're live right now, but we're about to take this clip and put it up on X, so there you go.
[03:13:30.930 --> 03:13:31.969]  InfoWars calls it.
[03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:33.510]  It's a headline.
[03:13:33.629 --> 03:13:34.530]  Fox News, hey.
[03:13:34.930 --> 03:13:35.809]  InfoWars calls it.
[03:13:35.889 --> 03:13:37.989]  Trump wins 2024 election.
[03:13:39.989 --> 03:13:43.729]  Public waiting for the 47th president of the United States to declare victory.
[03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:44.750]  There's your headline.
[03:13:45.329 --> 03:13:47.309]  Owen Harrison comments on this.
[03:13:47.950 --> 03:13:51.110]  Yeah, there's some very interesting numbers coming out.
[03:13:51.229 --> 03:14:01.010]  Fox News reporting that AP Votecast, and this is just statistically very unique, 23% of black men nationwide voted for Trump this year.
[03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:02.950]  Staggering numbers there.
[03:14:03.209 --> 03:14:09.069]  He is still projected to win the popular vote with the odds of him winning the whole thing up over 90%, according to most.
[03:14:09.849 --> 03:14:13.569]  Latino voters went for Trump 60% in Michigan.
[03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:16.989]  Donald Trump just won Anson County, North Carolina.
[03:14:17.170 --> 03:14:18.690]  That county is 40% black.
[03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:24.250]  Trump becomes the first, I'm sorry, just the second Republican to win this county since the 1870s.
[03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:27.370]  So first to win that county since Reconstruction.
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:33.239]  Really, this has been a landslide for all intents and purposes.
[03:14:33.540 --> 03:14:41.079]  I mean, maybe it doesn't look like that in the electoral map, but he has increased his share of practically every demographic across the board.
[03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:44.620]  And, I mean, it's over 90%.
[03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:48.659]  It's been over 90% likelihood of Trump winning for the last hour at least.
[03:14:49.450 --> 03:14:57.590]  Apparently the RNC just forced Center County Pennsylvania officials to stop counting ballots throughout the night as they plan to keep counting, or they plan to stop counting.
[03:14:57.850 --> 03:15:11.590]  So the thought is that they will not be able to pull off the late-night mail-in ballot dumps that they used to cheat in 2020, showing that the RNC being proactive and being on the ball has stopped them once again from having another vector for fraud.
[03:15:11.889 --> 03:15:15.129]  Trump has exceeded his 2020 share of the Hispanic vote.
[03:15:18.930 --> 03:15:21.729]  We're good to go.
[03:15:26.559 --> 03:15:28.559]  That they thought it would be.
[03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:41.879]  So just, you know, anywhere where there is secure elections, anywhere where they've done even the bare minimum of securing the elections, getting rid of mail-in votes and these things, he has increased his share of the electorate massively.
[03:15:41.940 --> 03:15:50.799]  It's only in the places where we knew they were going to cheat and where they talked about cheating or they talked about organizing together, secretaries of state and others, to rig this thing.
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:52.860]  And Harrison, we talked about this had to be decisive decision.
[03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:55.110]  So they couldn't play those games.
[03:15:55.309 --> 03:16:05.229]  And again, at a certain point, if 90% of people voted for a candidate, let's say if the fraud went on for 50 years and finally 90% voted, no one would be able to cover that up.
[03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:09.409]  So he's getting up into this, of the electorate, people that actually vote.
[03:16:10.049 --> 03:16:14.690]  Because is that 23% of black men voted of the voters or 23% of total black men?
[03:16:14.809 --> 03:16:16.729]  Because if that was 23% of...
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:22.540]  Voters, then that would be, you know, more like half of the black men.
[03:16:22.959 --> 03:16:23.940]  What's the number on that?
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:28.959]  It just says, VoteCast projects Trump winning a staggering 23% of black men nationwide.
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:30.500]  So that must be votes cast.
[03:16:30.639 --> 03:16:32.979]  23% of votes cast, I think, is what that's saying.
[03:16:33.459 --> 03:16:35.120]  All right, well, that's still better than the past.
[03:16:35.219 --> 03:16:36.600]  There is a political reliance.
[03:16:36.959 --> 03:16:42.700]  I know you guys have a clip of Ratburger just about 15 minutes ago who really helped steal it in Georgia four years ago.
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:44.899]  But we've got that clip from your end.
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:45.559]  Play it from your studio.
[03:16:54.639 --> 03:16:55.479]  All right, let's stop there.
[03:16:55.799 --> 03:16:59.420]  The crew wanted to play it from the other studio, which I didn't want to do.
[03:16:59.799 --> 03:17:01.299]  We have the clip over here.
[03:17:01.500 --> 03:17:02.540]  We'll play that clip.
[03:17:02.659 --> 03:17:09.639]  But I'm going to take this big announcement right now, and we're going to put it out on X the last 10-15 minutes we just talked about.
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:11.139]  That is so important.
[03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:12.399]  Candace Horbeck is our guest.
[03:17:12.559 --> 03:17:16.840]  We're going to get Roger Stone, General Flynn, and so many others popping in here tonight.
[03:17:16.860 --> 03:17:18.719]  Also, we have an X Spaces going.
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:23.239]  We're going to get in there and be taking your comments there and phone calls coming up.
[03:17:24.729 --> 03:17:28.350]  We're not there yet, but I'd say it's 99.5%.
[03:17:28.350 --> 03:17:34.229]  And so let's not quite get too excited yet, but it looks like it's in the bag, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:36.629 --> 03:17:39.010]  All right, we do have the Ratburger clip now.
[03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:42.030]  And Owen and Harrison, Trump's won.
[03:17:42.090 --> 03:17:43.329]  The left's now starting to capitulate.
[03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:52.170]  If Trump declares victory tonight, we can probably try to save the country if they don't shoot him, shoot down his airplane before he's president inaugurated.
[03:17:52.569 --> 03:17:56.170]  And so now the 76 days of hell begins, which we are the leading experts on.
[03:17:56.270 --> 03:18:00.129]  We coined all those terms and predicted everything before January 6th, even though I walked right into a trap later.
[03:18:00.690 --> 03:18:04.750]  So here we are, Owen and Harrison, and then Candace Horbach.
[03:18:04.889 --> 03:18:05.950]  Let's get your take on this.
[03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:08.069]  Again, I'm so excited.
[03:18:08.250 --> 03:18:12.930]  I don't want to celebrate too early, but we've got our champagne glasses, and everyone on Twitter is really excited.
[03:18:13.069 --> 03:18:16.049]  And a little cherry on top is Bitcoin is up over 8%.
[03:18:16.049 --> 03:18:21.149]  So again, if you have any crypto, this is really good for you, and it is telling.
[03:18:21.149 --> 03:18:24.690]  So I'm glad that you announced it first, right here on InfoWars.
[03:18:24.930 --> 03:18:28.110]  Well, the globalists want us to be poor to control us.
[03:18:28.190 --> 03:18:29.750]  The truth is, humans have unlimited resources.
[03:18:29.829 --> 03:18:30.690]  We can do anything.
[03:18:30.909 --> 03:18:31.290]  Mm-hmm.
[03:18:31.989 --> 03:18:32.729]  That is the truth.
[03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:35.149]  And I just want to say I love the crew.
[03:18:35.149 --> 03:18:36.950]  They put up with me because I'm so intense.
[03:18:36.969 --> 03:18:38.809]  And I just want to say we've been through hell here.
[03:18:39.049 --> 03:18:41.170]  And the crew's been through hell and Owen and all of us.
[03:18:41.350 --> 03:18:42.430]  But it's been worth it.
[03:18:42.510 --> 03:18:44.870]  And even if they shut us down next week, we'll continue on.
[03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:50.069]  And it's just a fitting end if we are shut down because it'll just explode us even bigger like Tucker Carlson.
[03:18:50.370 --> 03:18:53.389]  And we don't give up because they try to convince us we failed.
[03:18:53.549 --> 03:18:54.370]  No, you failed.
[03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:56.469]  You've been total tyrants in the world season.
[03:18:56.469 --> 03:18:58.569]  And so make a tyrant act like a tyrant.
[03:18:59.209 --> 03:19:00.409]  I think that's what's happening, right?
[03:19:00.569 --> 03:19:16.729]  And I think when we were talking about the typical voters that would vote Democrat, so these male black voters, the Hispanic voters, I mean, how insulting do you think it was when she was putting on these fake accents at these town halls, or when you have Obama that's emasculating a group of young black men.
[03:19:17.170 --> 03:19:19.930]  Everyone is fed up with it, and they're showing it in their votes.
[03:19:20.010 --> 03:19:21.889]  So, good job, America.
[03:19:23.210 --> 03:19:26.450]  Oh my goodness, but there's still a chance they can steal if he doesn't declare.
[03:19:26.670 --> 03:19:27.530]  Explain that, Owen.
[03:19:27.649 --> 03:19:28.370]  Explain that, Harrison.
[03:19:28.510 --> 03:19:28.829]  That's key.
[03:19:28.930 --> 03:19:30.010]  I know everybody pretty much gets it.
[03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:31.049]  We need to go to the technicals.
[03:19:31.879 --> 03:19:34.459]  Well, look, again, the numbers, it's over.
[03:19:34.700 --> 03:19:36.479]  I mean, Georgia is done.
[03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:38.379]  There's no way.
[03:19:38.500 --> 03:19:38.979]  I don't know.
[03:19:39.059 --> 03:19:42.959]  I haven't gotten any new updates, so I don't know if they're pausing it and rigging it.
[03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:51.659]  They've already announced that there's 50,000 ballots about to come into Philadelphia and another 40,000 tomorrow.
[03:19:52.219 --> 03:19:54.540]  I mean, they don't even hide it anymore.
[03:19:54.780 --> 03:19:56.399]  They're just saying what they're gonna do.
[03:19:56.459 --> 03:19:58.520]  And of course, every single one of those will be for Harris.
[03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:01.520]  And that's, guess what?
[03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:03.979]  Exactly the number that they'll need.
[03:20:04.639 --> 03:20:06.940]  So, I mean, this is ludicrous.
[03:20:07.100 --> 03:20:09.840]  But let's just say we stop them from cheating.
[03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:11.319]  And maybe it's a trap.
[03:20:11.479 --> 03:20:13.940]  I mean, honestly, Alex, I'm looking at this like, is it a trap?
[03:20:14.100 --> 03:20:21.280]  Are they just gonna let the Democrats do this and then catch them in the act and then- Like Trump has been saying, law enforcement on the scene, we're watching.
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:26.120]  So are they gonna let him drop 100,000 ballots in Philadelphia and then catch him?
[03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:32.600]  Are they gonna do the same thing in Wisconsin, in Michigan, where they're losing right now, also losing the Senate races?
[03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:36.540]  The Democrats are about to lose a lot of political power.
[03:20:37.239 --> 03:20:41.159]  And if we know anything about these people, they will do anything for political power.
[03:20:41.280 --> 03:20:43.079]  They will lie, cheat, and steal.
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:45.340]  And we are in the midnight hour right now.
[03:20:45.559 --> 03:20:50.500]  So look, if we didn't have the most corrupt times in American history, this election is over.
[03:20:50.799 --> 03:20:52.280]  Trump already has 270.
[03:20:52.579 --> 03:20:53.159]  It's done.
[03:20:53.319 --> 03:20:54.180]  He'd declare.
[03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:58.420]  We'd be popping the bottles, clinking the glasses, smoking the cigars.
[03:20:59.340 --> 03:21:01.000]  Unfortunately, that's not where we're at.
[03:21:01.139 --> 03:21:09.899]  Now, it's being reported from inside the Trump headquarters that Trump has prepared his victory speech, and he's getting ready to take the stage and declare victory.
[03:21:11.799 --> 03:21:15.440]  But they're not gonna, the mainstream media is all in on the steel right now.
[03:21:15.760 --> 03:21:19.600]  Fox, MSNBC, CNN, none of them will declare Georgia.
[03:21:19.899 --> 03:21:21.719]  None of them will declare Pennsylvania.
[03:21:22.079 --> 03:21:24.079]  Those states are over.
[03:21:24.319 --> 03:21:27.579]  And the fact they won't declare it tells me they're getting ready for shenanigans.
[03:21:29.399 --> 03:21:31.020]  Do we just say, screw them?
[03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:33.040]  They're completely invalidated.
[03:21:33.159 --> 03:21:34.399]  They have no control.
[03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:35.760]  They are liars.
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:36.399]  They are cheaters.
[03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:36.979]  We don't care.
[03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:38.379]  We don't need the mainstream media.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:39.159]  It's over.
[03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:41.799]  They've lied to us for nine years about Trump.
[03:21:41.920 --> 03:21:43.340]  They're gonna lie to us again tonight.
[03:21:43.659 --> 03:21:44.680]  So, I don't know.
[03:21:44.799 --> 03:21:54.850]  Maybe we have this weird It's a watershed cultural philosophical break moment tonight where we just leave them all behind.
[03:21:55.030 --> 03:22:00.930]  Trump declares victory and we say you're the leader, we're listening to you, we're moving forward with you.
[03:22:01.270 --> 03:22:06.709]  Anybody that is not on board, you're done, you're out of the picture, you're invalidated, you're discredited.
[03:22:09.020 --> 03:22:09.600]  That's right.
[03:22:09.659 --> 03:22:13.940]  Why don't we always let Fox News stab us in the back and lie about Arizona?
[03:22:13.940 --> 03:22:14.940]  That was proven later.
[03:22:15.899 --> 03:22:23.020]  Trump's got it unless they magically produce all these new fake ballots after the election.
[03:22:23.139 --> 03:22:28.559]  But if he continues to win other states, there'll be such a victory that won't even matter if they steal one or two of them.
[03:22:28.860 --> 03:22:29.940]  Harrison Smith, what are you thinking?
[03:22:30.860 --> 03:22:33.659]  I mean, look, yeah, they're announcing these big ballot drops.
[03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:38.319]  Apparently Detroit, Michigan, Wayne County are not delivering any partial votes.
[03:22:38.459 --> 03:22:40.600]  They're waiting to deliver all of the votes at once.
[03:22:40.780 --> 03:22:52.600]  So right now they have Trump up in Michigan, but this is Jocelyn Benson, the one that has been organizing all of the swing state secretaries of state to work together trying to defeat Trump, who she calls a common enemy.
[03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:58.149]  But like in Pennsylvania, he's up by 200,000 votes, I'm pretty sure.
[03:22:58.309 --> 03:23:00.510]  So they can dump 50, they can dump 70.
[03:23:00.709 --> 03:23:05.090]  I mean, they don't have enough votes to win this, as far as I can tell.
[03:23:05.270 --> 03:23:07.469]  Some places have already called Georgia.
[03:23:07.629 --> 03:23:10.610]  270 to win has called Georgia.
[03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:13.469]  I'm seeing the Daily Wire's called Georgia.
[03:23:13.569 --> 03:23:15.590]  So I mean, a lot of places are already calling Georgia.
[03:23:16.859 --> 03:23:19.780]  Pennsylvania, I mean, people are saying it would need a miracle, but it wouldn't be a miracle.
[03:23:19.899 --> 03:23:20.440]  It would be a cheat.
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:25.420]  It would be a dump of, you know, 200,000 votes, which they'd have to all go for Kamala.
[03:23:25.579 --> 03:23:26.139]  It's outrageous.
[03:23:26.159 --> 03:23:26.799]  It's impossible.
[03:23:27.899 --> 03:23:28.840]  As far as I can tell.
[03:23:30.239 --> 03:23:32.040]  And we've got the Democrats.
[03:23:32.219 --> 03:23:33.579]  Most of them look like people on the...
[03:23:34.290 --> 03:23:36.690]  Deck of the Titanic isn't singing, but some are still dancing.
[03:23:36.889 --> 03:23:38.510]  Let's fade that back up and go back to Harrison.
[03:23:41.209 --> 03:23:42.809]  I think that's the Trump campaign.
[03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:44.250]  Oh, that's the Trump campaign.
[03:23:44.510 --> 03:23:44.690]  Sorry.
[03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:46.629]  Oh, so there's the Trump campaign.
[03:23:46.829 --> 03:23:48.110]  Let's see what's happening with the Democrats.
[03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:49.370]  Sorry, I couldn't see the red hats.
[03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.790]  I'm blind.
[03:23:49.930 --> 03:23:51.069]  Yeah, forget the Titanic.
[03:23:51.389 --> 03:23:52.229]  There's your Democrat headquarters.
[03:23:52.409 --> 03:23:53.790]  The bleachers have already cleared out.
[03:23:54.370 --> 03:23:56.229]  They've pretty much accepted defeat.
[03:23:56.409 --> 03:23:57.149]  They're going home.
[03:23:58.069 --> 03:23:59.430]  You know, so it's kind of strange.
[03:23:59.430 --> 03:24:06.450]  It's like, I mean, we'll see if they have any ounce of integrity left if they just all of a sudden say, oh, we flipped Pennsylvania, we flipped Georgia.
[03:24:06.930 --> 03:24:11.110]  Even these Democrat voters would sit there and kind of have to double take at that.
[03:24:11.850 --> 03:24:13.350]  But I mean, all the trends are good.
[03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:17.350]  He's already reached critical mass in Pennsylvania and Georgia and Nebraska.
[03:24:17.649 --> 03:24:18.250]  That's 270.
[03:24:18.690 --> 03:24:22.950]  I mean, it's just, we're dealing with the same thing from 2020.
[03:24:23.170 --> 03:24:24.510]  Trump comes out, declares victory.
[03:24:24.670 --> 03:24:25.129]  And you know what?
[03:24:26.319 --> 03:24:33.600]  And not just declare victory, Trump has to announce to the American people, the mainstream media is dead, including Fox News.
[03:24:34.459 --> 03:24:36.719]  Our elections are completely rigged.
[03:24:36.860 --> 03:24:44.540]  It needs to be this watershed cultural, political, philosophical movement where we just break from the establishment entirely.
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:46.500]  We run the country now.
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:48.299]  We declare victory now.
[03:24:48.500 --> 03:24:49.620]  We leave you behind.
[03:24:49.719 --> 03:24:50.959]  You are irrelevant.
[03:24:51.079 --> 03:24:52.600]  You are invalidated.
[03:24:52.739 --> 03:24:53.620]  You are discredited.
[03:24:53.879 --> 03:24:54.840]  We break from you.
[03:24:54.979 --> 03:24:58.879]  You have no more control over our souls, minds, bodies.
[03:24:58.879 --> 03:24:59.760]  It's over.
[03:24:59.959 --> 03:25:03.659]  Whatever you try to pull off in the next whatever days, you're done.
[03:25:03.860 --> 03:25:05.319]  We're taking our country back.
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:20.290]  So some sort of a message of unification, putting the corrupt establishment behind, and just having that Break, just having that philosophical break, that cultural break, that political break, because they're doing the same things they did in 2020.
[03:25:20.709 --> 03:25:21.709]  I break from them.
[03:25:21.909 --> 03:25:24.250]  I null and void them.
[03:25:24.370 --> 03:25:25.610]  I discredit them.
[03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:26.809]  I'm done with them.
[03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:29.469]  We know you're liars, cheaters, and thieves.
[03:25:29.489 --> 03:25:30.790]  We break from you.
[03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:31.829]  We beat you.
[03:25:31.989 --> 03:25:34.590]  You couldn't out-cheat us with our votes.
[03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:36.430]  We win, you lose.
[03:25:36.569 --> 03:25:37.430]  We're done with you.
[03:25:37.659 --> 03:25:39.000]  I totally agree with you.
[03:25:39.100 --> 03:25:41.020]  We're not going to wait for Fox News to lie.
[03:25:41.260 --> 03:25:44.899]  We're not going to wait for them to drag this out as they said they wouldn't accept it, wouldn't do it.
[03:25:45.860 --> 03:25:47.540]  So when does Trump declare victory?
[03:25:47.540 --> 03:25:47.879]  Now?
[03:25:49.020 --> 03:25:50.840]  I would say as soon as possible.
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:52.659]  I would have done it 30 minutes ago.
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:55.799]  I don't know if they're waiting for, and here's my concern.
[03:25:57.239 --> 03:26:00.600]  I mean, I haven't gotten an update in Georgia for a while.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:02.700]  So that concerns me.
[03:26:02.879 --> 03:26:06.479]  Are they putting the covers up over the tabulation center in Fulton County?
[03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:08.379]  Is that magic happening again?
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:09.579]  You never know.
[03:26:09.739 --> 03:26:10.340]  You never know.
[03:26:10.399 --> 03:26:12.219]  But when they stop counting, it concerns me.
[03:26:12.299 --> 03:26:15.139]  I hope the Republicans are watching and not relying on Raffensperger.
[03:26:15.340 --> 03:26:22.620]  You know, maybe Raffensperger coming out and saying, oh, it's over, is him getting the dogs off his back so they can come in and run their play.
[03:26:23.949 --> 03:26:25.250]  Candace, you want to say something about that?
[03:26:25.350 --> 03:26:27.409]  No, that's actually a really good point.
[03:26:27.569 --> 03:26:30.809]  And then is there a risk of him coming out and claiming victory right now?
[03:26:30.909 --> 03:26:32.510]  Can they use that against him in any kind of way?
[03:26:35.610 --> 03:26:40.989]  I mean, Fox News declared it at like 7 o'clock at 9, and it turned out that we'd won Arizona.
[03:26:41.209 --> 03:26:47.729]  So they do this, and we've already beat all this fraud, and the numbers aren't there for them to get Pennsylvania now.
[03:26:47.729 --> 03:26:48.649]  There's not enough votes.
[03:26:49.049 --> 03:26:53.069]  The Secretary of State's announced Trump has won Georgia, but the mainstream media won't do it.
[03:26:53.149 --> 03:26:55.569]  So they're all scurrying around, figuring out what to do.
[03:26:55.969 --> 03:26:57.329]  And so...
[03:26:57.790 --> 03:26:59.690]  I mean, that's why we're wargaming it.
[03:26:59.770 --> 03:27:00.850]  We're all inside our heads.
[03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:04.590]  Whatever I'm thinking, you're hearing, what Owen's thinking, what Harris is thinking, what Candace is thinking.
[03:27:04.829 --> 03:27:05.930]  We've got to get Roger Stone.
[03:27:06.069 --> 03:27:07.370]  We've got to get General Flynn on here.
[03:27:07.469 --> 03:27:08.430]  So start calling them.
[03:27:08.829 --> 03:27:20.750]  Let's play the Ratzenberger clip from now about 40 minutes ago of the capitulation in Georgia that you're not really getting a lot of places, which tells you there's some chicanery probably going on.
[03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:21.250]  Here's the clip.
[03:27:22.129 --> 03:27:24.450]  I think you probably are following where we are right now.
[03:27:25.970 --> 03:27:31.829]  And where we see the numbers, 4.7, 4.8 of the total votes have already come in.
[03:27:33.350 --> 03:27:41.389]  That achievement of being done by 10.30 at night is a first in our history out of the 5.2 million.
[03:27:42.370 --> 03:27:50.110]  Also, if you look at who's leading the race right now, Donald J. Trump has an insurmountable lead with a low number of votes outstanding.
[03:27:51.569 --> 03:27:56.909]  And that's what they're basically saying, the numbers show in Pennsylvania, but they're not announcing that, Owen.
[03:27:56.950 --> 03:28:04.229]  And let's look with you and Harrison at some of the other states where those are going, but we're already almost to the number he needs, that 270.
[03:28:04.229 --> 03:28:07.049]  And then let's talk about the House and Senate races, the latest on that.
[03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:21.799]  Well, I like the way Wisconsin looks, and not just with the trends for the 10 electoral college votes, Wisconsin is also looking good for us to unseat Tammy Baldwin.
[03:28:22.559 --> 03:28:23.780]  And so- That'd be amazing.
[03:28:23.879 --> 03:28:27.219]  With that victory, that'll put Republicans plus two in the Senate.
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:34.709]  If we continue with the numbers in Pennsylvania, that puts Republicans Plus three in the Senate.
[03:28:34.989 --> 03:28:43.870]  And then depending on what happens in Michigan, which is trending nicely for the Senate and the presidency as well, you could see plus four in the Senate.
[03:28:44.090 --> 03:28:45.809]  What about Minnesota and Royce White?
[03:28:47.129 --> 03:28:48.069]  Minnesota's blue.
[03:28:48.329 --> 03:28:49.909]  That deal is pretty much done.
[03:28:50.110 --> 03:28:50.530]  Too bad.
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:55.379]  Only 61% reporting, but probably not going to change anytime soon.
[03:28:55.920 --> 03:28:59.239]  Trump's up in Wisconsin and Michigan at this point.
[03:28:59.340 --> 03:29:00.200]  He's up in Pennsylvania.
[03:29:00.219 --> 03:29:01.299]  He's up in Georgia.
[03:29:01.639 --> 03:29:04.459]  I mean, people are acting like he's won.
[03:29:04.540 --> 03:29:09.899]  Like MSNBC, all these people that I'm monitoring, they seem to have accepted it already.
[03:29:09.899 --> 03:29:12.899]  So I think he needs to make this speech as soon as possible.
[03:29:13.459 --> 03:29:15.500]  I think Owen is exactly right.
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:18.200]  He needs to come out ahead of this.
[03:29:18.899 --> 03:29:23.600]  And we're seeing more and more people saying Trump will be addressing supporters soon.
[03:29:24.159 --> 03:29:29.340]  People that are there in Mar-a-Lago are saying that he is preparing to give a speech momentarily.
[03:29:30.420 --> 03:29:32.760]  But, you know, there's a lot of rumors going around.
[03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:34.959]  I'm trying not to say anything that's not confirmed yet.
[03:29:35.760 --> 03:29:36.219]  So...
[03:29:38.270 --> 03:29:44.329]  All right, CNN just admitted that Trump has a larger margin in Georgia than there are outstanding votes but are still refusing to call Georgia.
[03:29:44.989 --> 03:29:47.809]  So that's just, why not?
[03:29:48.049 --> 03:29:48.610]  Why not?
[03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:50.250]  I mean, that's what the Secretary of State said.
[03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:52.510]  CNN admits it, so it's time to call Georgia.
[03:29:52.909 --> 03:29:56.110]  We can just put a Georgia on lock for Trump at this point.
[03:29:58.079 --> 03:30:00.440]  Yeah, it's virtually the same situation in Pennsylvania.
[03:30:00.440 --> 03:30:03.420]  There's more outstanding votes, but it's virtually the same situation.
[03:30:03.799 --> 03:30:05.239]  Trump needs to come out again.
[03:30:05.780 --> 03:30:12.040]  He'll choose his messaging here to be as aggressive or as peaceful as he wants.
[03:30:12.260 --> 03:30:24.530]  But I mean, maybe even pepper in, if you're gonna show up, At 3 o'clock in the morning tonight, with 100,000 votes for Harris in five different counties, law enforcement will be arresting you.
[03:30:25.090 --> 03:30:28.450]  I mean, just shut this thing down now.
[03:30:28.809 --> 03:30:30.469]  Shut it down now.
[03:30:30.670 --> 03:30:38.209]  And you tell them, if you're going to be delivering the perfect number of votes like you did in 2020, We're gonna arrest you, even if he's bluffing.
[03:30:38.290 --> 03:30:38.870]  I don't even care.
[03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:40.030]  Just bluff it.
[03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:43.610]  Just do something to stop them from stealing this, because this is outrageous.
[03:30:43.649 --> 03:30:44.790]  This deal is over.
[03:30:44.969 --> 03:30:46.209]  It's just like 2020.
[03:30:46.530 --> 03:30:47.389]  We've won.
[03:30:47.549 --> 03:30:48.930]  It's time to declare victory.
[03:30:49.530 --> 03:30:52.510]  And by the way, Trump did flip Erie County in Pennsylvania.
[03:30:53.629 --> 03:30:54.309]  It's done.
[03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:56.649]  Yeah, it is pretty much done.
[03:30:56.709 --> 03:30:58.049]  I mean, 86% reporting.
[03:30:58.049 --> 03:30:59.510]  He's up by 200,000.
[03:30:59.850 --> 03:31:01.290]  Is that right, 200,000?
[03:31:02.360 --> 03:31:06.500]  I mean, look, all right, so if we wanna, I mean, Harrison, if we wanna kind of, let's say, let's put the negativity aside.
[03:31:06.879 --> 03:31:15.020]  I mean, now we're looking at this, Trump could win Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona is looking pretty good right now.
[03:31:15.139 --> 03:31:19.079]  I mean, Arizona, whatever, somehow the vote in Arizona goes perfectly 50-50.
[03:31:19.299 --> 03:31:22.000]  I mean, it's almost impossible, but yet here we are.
[03:31:23.819 --> 03:31:35.639]  But I mean, if you get Michigan, Wisconsin, and then either Arizona or Nevada, you're looking at a decisive victory, and Trump is currently on pace to win the popular vote.
[03:31:36.479 --> 03:31:37.559]  Which is just amazing.
[03:31:37.700 --> 03:31:40.000]  And if you go to, I think Jack Posobiec tweeted it out.
[03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:40.739]  I retweeted it.
[03:31:41.040 --> 03:31:47.299]  The map that shows which direction the vote moved, whether it moved red or blue, and how far.
[03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:50.979]  And I mean, the entire country shifted red significantly.
[03:31:51.280 --> 03:31:52.920]  So, I mean, it's...
[03:31:53.610 --> 03:31:55.969]  It's not possible that he didn't win at this point.
[03:31:56.090 --> 03:31:59.690]  And everybody I see on X is basically saying the same thing.
[03:31:59.690 --> 03:32:00.629]  He needs to announce.
[03:32:00.770 --> 03:32:01.950]  Why is he not announcing?
[03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:07.870]  I mean, people are very eager to get this over with and just call it.
[03:32:07.870 --> 03:32:08.950]  Well, I understand why they're doing it.
[03:32:08.989 --> 03:32:12.149]  He's got to be careful, although spin it back like he declared too early.
[03:32:13.489 --> 03:32:14.870]  But it's a sweet spot.
[03:32:14.969 --> 03:32:16.010]  He needs to do it within one hour.
[03:32:16.209 --> 03:32:18.450]  I predict at...
[03:32:19.149 --> 03:32:20.670]  It's 11.35 here.
[03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:21.750]  Let's go with Eastern Time.
[03:32:21.870 --> 03:32:23.090]  It's 12.35 Eastern.
[03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:25.530]  I predict...
[03:32:25.530 --> 03:32:28.270]  Let me think here.
[03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:40.030]  I am projecting, which is about a 95% prediction, I am predicting that at 1.27, Trump comes out on the stage.
[03:32:40.190 --> 03:32:41.209]  1.27.
[03:32:42.489 --> 03:32:43.809]  You guys want to call a number?
[03:32:44.049 --> 03:32:44.850]  Make a bet here?
[03:32:45.920 --> 03:32:49.399]  I think he comes out at, I think we're 25 minutes away.
[03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:55.520]  I was going to say pretty much the same thing, that it's going to be at exactly 1, leave it to 12 p.m.
[03:32:55.940 --> 03:32:56.540]  or 12 a.m.
[03:32:57.020 --> 03:32:57.440]  Central Time.
[03:32:57.559 --> 03:33:01.159]  Apparently Kamala Harris has announced she will not be speaking at her party tonight.
[03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:05.510]  It's a Hillary Clinton maneuver here.
[03:33:05.709 --> 03:33:08.649]  A campaign official says large crowds have already begun to leave.
[03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:12.030]  So they're already clearing out of Howard University where she was supposed to give her a victory.
[03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:12.370]  That's it.
[03:33:12.510 --> 03:33:13.270]  Final side.
[03:33:13.950 --> 03:33:14.090]  Wow.
[03:33:14.290 --> 03:33:15.510]  Tell us where that's being reported.
[03:33:15.989 --> 03:33:16.290]  Oh my God.
[03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.950]  Just like Hillary.
[03:33:17.149 --> 03:33:20.209]  First time ever in modern history that a loser...
[03:33:20.239 --> 03:33:29.020]  That a loser, Hillary did it in 2016, got drunk reportedly by her own people and threw fits and had to be restrained by the Secret Service.
[03:33:29.379 --> 03:33:32.280]  And so now, I'm sorry, report that slowly.
[03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:32.879]  I'm interrupting.
[03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:37.239]  Harris Smith, CBS reporting she will not speak to the deck of the Titanic.
[03:33:37.659 --> 03:33:38.700]  Ha ha ha ha!
[03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:39.520]  Yeah!
[03:33:40.239 --> 03:33:41.579]  Woo, baby!
[03:33:42.770 --> 03:33:44.209]  That's what it says.
[03:33:44.350 --> 03:33:46.450]  Large crowds clearing out.
[03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:47.569]  That's Howard University.
[03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:50.209]  I think that's the feed we've been seeing.
[03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:53.489]  So maybe we can watch as they clear out.
[03:33:53.629 --> 03:33:54.250]  I mean...
[03:33:54.250 --> 03:33:56.290]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:33:59.819]  Oh my God, now the real war starts.
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:15.219]  Now we're looking at a situation, if these things play out and we avoid any shenanigans, Republicans are gonna have a decisive majority in the Senate with new leadership, a good enough majority in the House to control its fate.
[03:34:15.440 --> 03:34:17.819]  I hope Byron Donald is the speaker, by the way.
[03:34:18.120 --> 03:34:21.479]  Hopefully with better leadership than Mike Johnson, who might be worse than McCarthy.
[03:34:22.219 --> 03:34:23.239]  This is a remake.
[03:34:23.579 --> 03:34:32.840]  I mean, I don't wanna get ahead of it, but if I'm looking at the positives now, it's not, I mean, this is like 50% of everything we've been fighting for.
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:39.059]  I mean, we finally have a political movement that can save this country politically.
[03:34:39.379 --> 03:34:49.739]  We finally have end roads, a beachhead in the White House, in the Senate, and in the House that we can save our country politically.
[03:34:50.190 --> 03:34:52.569]  And we've got Elon Musk joining the team.
[03:34:52.729 --> 03:34:54.350]  We've got RFK Jr.
[03:34:54.829 --> 03:34:55.430]  joining the team.
[03:34:55.569 --> 03:34:58.049]  We have people who want to limit the government down to nothing.
[03:34:58.270 --> 03:35:00.729]  We have people that want to get rid of the federal bureaucracy.
[03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:02.290]  We have RFK Jr.
[03:35:02.430 --> 03:35:03.889]  that wants to make America healthy again.
[03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:10.030]  I don't have the relief yet, but I mean, we are looking over the edge.
[03:35:10.940 --> 03:35:14.479]  We are looking over the edge of everything we've been fighting for.
[03:35:14.659 --> 03:35:24.639]  And if we get this decisive victory tonight and the rest of these states go our way, Alex, it's what we've been fighting for.
[03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:26.559]  It's the political movement.
[03:35:26.739 --> 03:35:28.920]  It's finally the Infowars vision.
[03:35:29.159 --> 03:35:34.719]  It's finally the vision of a bright, prosperous, free future, common sense.
[03:35:35.879 --> 03:35:37.440]  And we're looking right at it.
[03:35:37.559 --> 03:35:38.639]  We can almost touch it.
[03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:39.760]  We can almost smell it.
[03:35:39.860 --> 03:35:40.739]  We can almost taste it.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:45.540]  As of four minutes ago, NBC News declares Trump the winner in Georgia.
[03:35:45.940 --> 03:35:48.780]  They finally have called Georgia for Trump.
[03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:50.760]  NBC News at least has.
[03:35:51.979 --> 03:35:55.680]  NBC has called for Trump for Georgia.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:57.120]  Georgia for Trump, rather.
[03:35:58.260 --> 03:35:59.360]  Very, very interesting.
[03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:05.069]  And I guess that would tell me Pennsylvania is right around the corner.
[03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:11.729]  Guys, give me Pennsylvania on the big board as it looks like the Trump headquarters is about to explode.
[03:36:12.430 --> 03:36:14.909]  Give me Pennsylvania on the big board, please.
[03:36:17.129 --> 03:36:17.950]  Let's see here.
[03:36:18.090 --> 03:36:19.430]  Well, we've had a bit of a stall.
[03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:20.229]  Look.
[03:36:21.799 --> 03:36:23.219]  These numbers are insurmountable.
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:25.680]  It's just, it's not possible.
[03:36:25.780 --> 03:36:33.520]  Even with the late night ballot dump, I don't think they can bring this back to where it needs to be.
[03:36:34.219 --> 03:36:42.620]  And if you, even if Harris gets, I mean, she would need 65, maybe 70% of the remaining votes to win it.
[03:36:43.239 --> 03:36:45.100]  I mean, it's like, yeah.
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:54.540]  We'll wait and see what the next ballot dump does before they bring in all of their Harris ballots tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon or next month.
[03:36:54.899 --> 03:37:06.739]  But if Trump gets to 3.3 with above 90%, then it's impossible.
[03:37:06.739 --> 03:37:16.299]  If Trump hits 3.4, I mean, the only way that they could do it at that point would be the most obvious steal that you've ever seen, even worse than 2020.
[03:37:17.219 --> 03:37:18.879]  So, and that'll be it.
[03:37:19.500 --> 03:37:27.860]  I don't know if Trump is waiting for Pennsylvania to be declared before he gives his speech, but if it's just like Georgia, we've been calling it all night, it's only inevitable.
[03:37:28.180 --> 03:37:34.100]  And then we'll be watching the Senate races, because let's be clear here, let's not sleep on these Senate races either.
[03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:47.510]  Let's not celebrate, I mean, we will celebrate Trump's victory, but then let's keep our eye on these Senate races, because they might pull some shenanigans in these Senate races to try to keep that Republican majority as slim as possible.
[03:37:47.809 --> 03:38:02.229]  Even though right now, I mean, we're looking at, I would say, at least plus one, probably plus two or three even, depending on how things end up going in Wisconsin and Michigan, which are both trending on a Republican victory for the presidency and the Senate.
[03:38:02.540 --> 03:38:06.719]  Carrie Lake just, for whatever reason, can't win an election in Arizona.
[03:38:06.719 --> 03:38:07.860]  It's really unfortunate.
[03:38:07.860 --> 03:38:10.979]  It looks like she's not gonna be able to beat the Lego.
[03:38:11.639 --> 03:38:14.739]  And then there's just not enough information in Nevada right now.
[03:38:15.340 --> 03:38:29.959]  But again, when you look at what's going on in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, current trends have the Republicans winning those three states at the presidential level and at the Senate level.
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:30.819]  Now, these are tight.
[03:38:31.739 --> 03:38:43.819]  These are tight, but if the Republicans do that, they will have at least a three-seat majority and the mandate and new leadership in the Senate.
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:45.879]  This is beautiful.
[03:38:46.139 --> 03:38:47.940]  This is really beautiful.
[03:38:48.180 --> 03:38:50.739]  And I hope that we're watching these campaigns.
[03:38:50.940 --> 03:38:58.739]  I hope that these Republican Senate candidates are watching these numbers very closely, because they can pull a shenanigan just to steal a Senate seat.
[03:39:00.020 --> 03:39:02.280]  But everything is where it should be right now.
[03:39:02.459 --> 03:39:03.379]  Everything's looking good.
[03:39:03.459 --> 03:39:04.459]  Guys, what do we have in Nevada?
[03:39:04.959 --> 03:39:07.260]  There's still just no numbers coming in here.
[03:39:07.500 --> 03:39:09.100]  I don't know what's going on with that.
[03:39:09.260 --> 03:39:13.479]  Okay, well, we'll try to figure out why Nevada keeps just staying blank.
[03:39:14.420 --> 03:39:16.639]  But this is incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:18.799]  Trump is on pace to win the popular vote.
[03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:20.680]  He's outperforming in many blue states.
[03:39:22.479 --> 03:39:26.100]  I mean, this is your 2016 election result before they stole it in 2020.
[03:39:26.840 --> 03:39:31.780]  So now you're on the verge of a light landslide.
[03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:33.799]  I won't say a heavy.
[03:39:33.899 --> 03:39:34.959]  A very slight landslide.
[03:39:34.979 --> 03:39:35.639]  But a light.
[03:39:35.860 --> 03:39:36.319]  A light.
[03:39:36.579 --> 03:39:38.200]  And again, what did I predict?
[03:39:38.639 --> 03:39:40.440]  They have the blue seawall of fraud.
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:43.760]  The red tsunami's got to be huge.
[03:39:43.879 --> 03:39:44.639]  Total landslide.
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:45.760]  And then it looks just like...
[03:39:46.819 --> 03:39:48.299]  You know, a decent win.
[03:39:48.700 --> 03:39:49.459]  Boom, baby!
[03:39:49.579 --> 03:39:50.579]  We made it over the top.
[03:39:50.719 --> 03:39:52.659]  It looks like it's done.
[03:39:52.879 --> 03:39:54.000]  They're already capitulating.
[03:39:54.379 --> 03:39:57.399]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, this is so historic.
[03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:03.399]  I want to play a video from, this has got to be 18 years ago, in New York.
[03:40:04.010 --> 03:40:08.909]  Where I was premiering a 9-11 film with 9-11 survivors, police, and firefighters who were exposing what really happened there.
[03:40:09.370 --> 03:40:15.629]  And I told the globalists, because I believe in humanity, I said, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:24.370]  And all the hell they put us through in this country and the human smuggling and the sex trafficking and the wars and the evil, you know, we haven't completely smashed them yet, but they're routed right now.
[03:40:24.629 --> 03:40:25.569]  The tide has been turned.
[03:40:25.709 --> 03:40:26.950]  I want to thank God for all this.
[03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:28.129]  I want to thank God for the crew.
[03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:29.969]  We could not do this without the crew.
[03:40:30.069 --> 03:40:31.510]  We could not do it without the listeners and supporters.
[03:40:32.170 --> 03:40:36.940]  Everything you've done over the years, Standing with me, standing with the crew, is now coming to this.
[03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:39.559]  And it's not about credit, but it's a historical fact for the listeners.
[03:40:39.899 --> 03:40:55.540]  We are recognized in Congress by the CIA, by our enemies, by Tucker Carlson, by everybody, the good guys and the bad guys, as the program that reached the most people and took the hits and got this popularized so people could look at the globalists, what they were actually doing.
[03:40:55.639 --> 03:40:58.639]  They write books saying world government, they're going to kill us all with shots, and they start doing it.
[03:40:58.780 --> 03:41:00.840]  I mean, my job, I thought, wasn't hard.
[03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:06.809]  Because people need to listen, you know, and see what the enemy's saying.
[03:41:06.930 --> 03:41:10.850]  And I believe if you saw it, you'd rally with me, especially if stuff got worse.
[03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:13.629]  I mean, they're making kids eat bugs now and next adults.
[03:41:13.809 --> 03:41:14.610]  I mean, it's here.
[03:41:14.809 --> 03:41:17.170]  And World War III with Russia, this isn't a game.
[03:41:17.250 --> 03:41:18.329]  And who knows what they'll pull now.
[03:41:18.530 --> 03:41:22.170]  I'm not saying we're out of the woods, but humanity itself is making a really good showing.
[03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:23.989]  The explosive awakening is incredible.
[03:41:23.989 --> 03:41:26.049]  So I want to commend everybody for this journey.
[03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.729]  Like Trump said...
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:39.180]  On Sunday, a very powerful part of the speech, he said, look, they're fighting like hell to steal, but they still don't think we'll win, but if they steal it, you know, I'm done because they're going to put me in prison, but you've got to continue on and fight because this is tyranny, and it's for our children, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:41:39.479 --> 03:41:42.280]  said, and, you know, I admire RFK Jr.
[03:41:42.500 --> 03:41:43.399]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:41:43.479 --> 03:41:44.659]  I know he appreciates me.
[03:41:44.780 --> 03:41:45.540]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:41:46.319 --> 03:41:50.719]  And, you know, but it's about the children, and it's about the future.
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:56.760]  So, my little message to the New World Order, then and now, if you want to fight, you got one.
[03:42:07.200 --> 03:42:13.639]  I have the humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:42:13.799 --> 03:42:15.979]  You better believe you've got one!
[03:42:17.860 --> 03:42:23.079]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:42:31.889 --> 03:42:41.209]  Well, as we reported six, seven minutes ago, and that's the capitulation, Harris has canceled her victory speech, and you're supposed to speak, you know, be a good sport when you lose.
[03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:56.360]  Hillary did this in 2016, only time in history that someone didn't do this, going back to the first election in 1789, when George Washington's Opponent lost.
[03:42:56.760 --> 03:42:58.399]  They were gracious about it.
[03:42:58.780 --> 03:43:01.420]  It's now happened twice in 2016 and 2024.
[03:43:01.920 --> 03:43:03.840]  And now the crowd is shuffling off.
[03:43:03.940 --> 03:43:08.059]  Their god, their fake witch, their puppet has fallen.
[03:43:08.340 --> 03:43:10.979]  Their great idol has fallen.
[03:43:11.639 --> 03:43:14.280]  And so now we've got serious, serious work to do.
[03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:16.600]  So I'm going to go ahead and open this.
[03:43:17.420 --> 03:43:19.780]  We're not alcoholic around here.
[03:43:20.319 --> 03:43:21.719]  I'm not looking down on people that...
[03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:24.030]  Is this even a bottle opener?
[03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:25.989]  Is there a bottle opener even in this place?
[03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:28.549]  I mean, I'm not complaining here, but this is historic.
[03:43:29.090 --> 03:43:30.690]  Can I have a real bottle opener, guys?
[03:43:31.090 --> 03:43:32.549]  Shit, I'll go to the store and buy one.
[03:43:32.709 --> 03:43:35.129]  I mean, there's got to be one in this facility.
[03:43:36.190 --> 03:43:37.469]  This is too historic.
[03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:38.350]  This is too historic.
[03:43:38.729 --> 03:43:40.250]  Go to a promo, go to a break.
[03:43:40.370 --> 03:43:41.309]  I'm not going to mess this up.
[03:43:41.930 --> 03:43:50.049]  After Brexit and Russia pulling out, this will be a devastating event to their operations.
[03:43:53.079 --> 03:43:54.139]  Flawless victory.
[03:43:54.620 --> 03:44:03.879]  It is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the president-elect of the United States.
[03:44:03.879 --> 03:44:04.680]  Is this Valhalla?
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:06.479]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:07.280]  It's amazing.
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:07.719]  Take my hand.
[03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:11.809]  Right now, a historic moment.
[03:44:12.209 --> 03:44:15.430]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race, CNN projects.
[03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:18.309]  Donald Trump, he's walking up right now.
[03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:19.489]  You see him right there.
[03:44:19.709 --> 03:44:22.309]  He's gonna be speaking momentarily.
[03:44:23.649 --> 03:44:25.750]  History has been made, Jake.
[03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:27.209]  This is a moment a lot of people are gonna remember.
[03:44:27.209 --> 03:44:28.530]  These bankers wanted to keep us poor.
[03:44:29.090 --> 03:44:30.649]  The tax example, they F's us.
[03:44:31.129 --> 03:44:33.049]  Get ready, you're about to get F's right back.
[03:44:33.950 --> 03:44:34.909]  And Islamists?
[03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:37.149]  Here come cruise missiles.
[03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:39.350]  Bud Buckley, this is the good stuff.
[03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:46.239]  To Pennsylvania Avenue, I think it's a moment that a lot of people- Uma's getting moved out of Pennsylvania Avenue.
[03:44:46.700 --> 03:44:49.200]  Whatever happened, but- I think Uma's going to jail.
[03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:50.440]  Decisive win.
[03:44:50.600 --> 03:44:52.120]  No more spirit vendors?
[03:44:52.940 --> 03:44:55.440]  I hear that she and her husband are both plea bargains.
[03:44:55.940 --> 03:44:56.659]  Let's get ready.
[03:44:56.780 --> 03:44:57.239]  Here goes Trump.
[03:44:58.399 --> 03:44:59.180]  Turn it up.
[03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:00.219]  Donald J. Trump.
[03:45:00.639 --> 03:45:02.340]  He's going up to the microphones.
[03:45:02.620 --> 03:45:04.420]  He's gonna be- The golden toad.
[03:45:04.579 --> 03:45:06.899]  I assume he'll mention the phone call he received.
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:07.479]  Get ready.
[03:45:07.700 --> 03:45:10.020]  I tell you, he charges into a goblin's nest.
[03:45:10.379 --> 03:45:11.239]  This is amazing.
[03:45:11.440 --> 03:45:16.920]  As long as he doesn't- As long as he doesn't kiss a goblin, goblins vomit.
[03:45:17.079 --> 03:45:18.180]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:20.379]  I don't think there's any danger to that.
[03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:21.899]  No, he defeated the goblin.
[03:45:22.020 --> 03:45:22.479]  He did it.
[03:45:24.860 --> 03:45:25.760]  Here you go again.
[03:45:28.020 --> 03:45:32.940]  Think about in what the new Trump led world here in Washington.
[03:45:33.100 --> 03:45:33.799]  I wonder what Mr.
[03:45:33.959 --> 03:45:35.079]  Maddow is gonna be saying tomorrow.
[03:45:35.739 --> 03:45:36.680]  I'll take some more of that.
[03:45:46.979 --> 03:45:50.059]  And then they tried to put us in prison and did put Owen in prison.
[03:45:53.459 --> 03:45:54.719]  Stone got pardoned.
[03:45:54.940 --> 03:46:00.200]  And here we are tonight with the crew in the same studio as we were eight years ago.
[03:46:00.959 --> 03:46:02.479]  And I just want to split everybody.
[03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:04.559]  It is the victory.
[03:46:05.399 --> 03:46:08.100]  Who knows what they're going to pull now, but Trump has won.
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:09.520]  It's already being announced.
[03:46:10.399 --> 03:46:12.059]  This is a day long remembered.
[03:46:12.180 --> 03:46:12.819]  Come in here, crew.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:13.399]  I love you.
[03:46:13.899 --> 03:46:15.559]  You have put up with so much.
[03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:16.700]  You've gone through so much.
[03:46:16.760 --> 03:46:19.459]  Owen went to prison, and they're going to come after us again.
[03:46:19.579 --> 03:46:20.139]  But you know what?
[03:46:20.239 --> 03:46:21.299]  They know we're not intimidated.
[03:46:21.559 --> 03:46:22.600]  They know we're going to keep fighting.
[03:46:23.799 --> 03:46:24.500]  God bless you all.
[03:46:24.559 --> 03:46:27.079]  Anybody else needed any more of this delicious apple juice?
[03:46:27.399 --> 03:46:28.420]  I love you guys.
[03:46:28.700 --> 03:46:29.200]  Oh, yes.
[03:46:29.219 --> 03:46:30.579]  Let me give the lady here.
[03:46:31.819 --> 03:46:32.659]  Some of this here.
[03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:33.420]  All right.
[03:46:33.680 --> 03:46:34.520]  Sorry, we were...
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:36.420]  I was dumbfounded.
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:37.459]  God smacked here.
[03:46:38.079 --> 03:46:41.360]  Here is to all the listeners and viewers that kept us in attack formation.
[03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:46.719]  Here's a President Trump, our champion, his incredible stalwart, Will, his family standing with him.
[03:46:47.109 --> 03:46:49.129]  Here's to God, of course, number one.
[03:46:49.370 --> 03:46:53.149]  And of course, we are now going to go after the child traffickers and find out where the children are.
[03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:55.290]  We're going to take the floor out of the water.
[03:46:55.430 --> 03:46:56.989]  We're going to go after the poison vaccines.
[03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:59.010]  We're going to stop World War III if God is with us.
[03:46:59.229 --> 03:47:01.709]  All praise goes to God, but God works through the people.
[03:47:01.989 --> 03:47:08.040]  And so for myself and the whole crew, on the eve of our shutdown next week, We will never surrender in the face of tyranny.
[03:47:08.159 --> 03:47:09.379]  We know more obstacles are coming.
[03:47:09.579 --> 03:47:12.500]  We know the real fight starts in the 76 days while he's president-elect.
[03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:25.899]  We pray for President Trump, but now we take a moment to celebrate that we stood against the tyrants and have won a major strategic, historic battle against the globalists, and this is just the beginning.
[03:47:26.139 --> 03:47:30.520]  They declared war on us, and we accepted the challenge!
[03:47:30.799 --> 03:47:31.319]  Yes!
[03:47:33.079 --> 03:47:33.600]  Yes!
[03:47:36.399 --> 03:47:36.739]  Yes!
[03:47:36.739 --> 03:47:37.840]  I love you all.
[03:47:38.239 --> 03:47:39.319]  It's been a war.
[03:47:40.180 --> 03:47:42.000]  And the war continues.
[03:47:43.819 --> 03:47:45.219]  I love you, Owen.
[03:47:45.420 --> 03:47:46.360]  I love all of you.
[03:47:47.420 --> 03:47:48.200]  Incredible job.
[03:47:48.319 --> 03:47:53.399]  And we only got two microphones here, but I would like to maybe have folks come up to the microphone in the other studio so everybody can get on air.
[03:47:53.479 --> 03:47:54.459]  But this is just crazy.
[03:47:54.579 --> 03:47:56.940]  Owen, get in here and then Harrison, broadcast some.
[03:47:56.979 --> 03:47:57.819]  Give us your views right here.
[03:47:58.659 --> 03:48:00.680]  I think my lob mic might still be on.
[03:48:01.059 --> 03:48:01.540]  It's okay.
[03:48:01.659 --> 03:48:02.260]  Sit down right here.
[03:48:03.529 --> 03:48:04.750]  It's over in Pennsylvania.
[03:48:04.829 --> 03:48:05.530]  It's over.
[03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:06.489]  The numbers are in.
[03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:07.709]  They can't come back.
[03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:09.569]  It's officially 270.
[03:48:10.489 --> 03:48:14.290]  Trump might wait until they officially declare it, but it's done.
[03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:15.790]  We did it.
[03:48:16.370 --> 03:48:21.430]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona might go for Trump too, so it's a little bit of a light landslide.
[03:48:21.549 --> 03:48:24.010]  Looks like Republicans are going to get at least plus three in the Senate.
[03:48:24.690 --> 03:48:26.069]  At least plus four in the House.
[03:48:26.450 --> 03:48:30.569]  We have new leadership at both the Senate and the House level that are serious.
[03:48:30.770 --> 03:48:31.489]  They're behind Trump.
[03:48:31.770 --> 03:48:33.329]  We have Elon Musk on our team.
[03:48:33.610 --> 03:48:36.190]  We've got Vivek Ramaswamy changing the message for the future.
[03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:39.729]  We have J.D. Vance, who's about as down-to-earth as it gets.
[03:48:39.829 --> 03:48:40.649]  We have RFK Jr.
[03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:44.469]  who wants to take the fluoride out of the water, the microplastics out of the food.
[03:48:45.270 --> 03:48:45.950]  I don't know.
[03:48:46.489 --> 03:48:49.530]  I'm almost in suspension right now.
[03:48:49.530 --> 03:49:06.540]  I can't even believe That everything we've worked for, everything we've envisioned, all the common sense barriers for us to take down to release the American potential, the potential of the American citizen, I hope, I really mean this, I hope to all the brainwashed,
[03:49:06.680 --> 03:49:11.709]  deranged leftists that are suffering tonight, That this will be your last moment of suffering.
[03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:14.149]  I hope that they will join us in this victory.
[03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:15.610]  This is a victory for you too.
[03:49:15.889 --> 03:49:16.969]  We are freeing you.
[03:49:17.229 --> 03:49:18.530]  We are freeing your minds.
[03:49:18.729 --> 03:49:19.889]  We are freeing your bodies.
[03:49:20.090 --> 03:49:21.270]  We are freeing your souls.
[03:49:21.549 --> 03:49:22.590]  Join our team.
[03:49:22.850 --> 03:49:24.329]  We are raising the tides.
[03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:25.670]  We are raising all the ships.
[03:49:26.450 --> 03:49:29.290]  And just join the team.
[03:49:30.020 --> 03:49:37.879]  Even if you hate Donald Trump and you can't stand the sight of him, join Team Humanity, join Team Common Sense, join Team America.
[03:49:38.399 --> 03:49:41.120]  This could be the American Revolution 2.0.
[03:49:41.299 --> 03:49:44.799]  When America was founded, it changed the entire course of human history.
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:46.399]  We're doing it again tonight.
[03:49:46.700 --> 03:49:48.340]  We're taking our country back!
[03:49:48.719 --> 03:49:48.940]  Yeah!
[03:49:49.639 --> 03:49:49.920]  Yeah!
[03:49:50.620 --> 03:49:51.100]  Yeah!
[03:49:54.100 --> 03:49:54.680]  That's it.
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:55.299]  Anybody else?
[03:49:55.420 --> 03:49:55.920]  Get in there.
[03:49:56.059 --> 03:49:56.500]  Come on in.
[03:49:56.559 --> 03:49:57.120]  Rex Jones.
[03:49:57.260 --> 03:49:57.600]  No, I'm all right.
[03:50:00.859 --> 03:50:02.420]  Rob, do you want to scream?
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:04.920]  I'm just going to say this.
[03:50:05.059 --> 03:50:06.780]  I agree with your message.
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:18.819]  You know, with putting a hand out to these people who are under some serious mind control, there is a mind control going on in this country, and it's ending now.
[03:50:19.440 --> 03:50:22.379]  And people are going to see how much better their lives are going to be.
[03:50:22.479 --> 03:50:24.360]  Because a lot of these leftists are into health.
[03:50:24.620 --> 03:50:31.200]  And now when that RFK is coming out and he's going to be hardcore on what's in our food and getting that stuff, that's where it's going to happen.
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:34.299]  That's where these people are going to go, wait a minute, maybe I was on the wrong side.
[03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:36.379]  Maybe I didn't know what was going on.
[03:50:36.879 --> 03:50:41.659]  And if they catch more of this cheating that they're doing, we've got to get rid of these goddamn election machines.
[03:50:41.829 --> 03:50:42.549]  They suck.
[03:50:42.709 --> 03:50:43.350]  Mail-in ballots.
[03:50:43.350 --> 03:50:44.389]  They just suck.
[03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:46.670]  This thing where it takes 14...
[03:50:46.670 --> 03:50:46.889]  Oh, we're going away.
[03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:48.190]  Yeah, it's got to go...
[03:50:48.190 --> 03:50:54.350]  I like one day make it a national holiday, make everybody dip their thumb in purple ink, and let's just do it, you know?
[03:50:54.430 --> 03:50:55.629]  Let's stop screwing around.
[03:50:55.870 --> 03:50:56.850]  There's no reason...
[03:50:56.850 --> 03:50:59.270]  There's no reason to be messing around with this anymore.
[03:50:59.469 --> 03:51:00.049]  All right?
[03:51:00.129 --> 03:51:01.969]  The mainstream media is defunct.
[03:51:02.190 --> 03:51:03.530]  They should be shunned.
[03:51:03.709 --> 03:51:05.290]  All these people should go away.
[03:51:05.530 --> 03:51:06.510]  They're disgusting.
[03:51:07.460 --> 03:51:09.219]  And then they're not going to stop either.
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:10.340]  They're going to keep coming after us.
[03:51:10.459 --> 03:51:13.799]  We cannot let them get an ounce of breath at this point.
[03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.969]  Yeah, no.
[03:51:19.809 --> 03:51:24.469]  Without mail-in ballots and illegal immigration, this election wouldn't even be close at all.
[03:51:24.649 --> 03:51:25.569]  Everywhere is shift red.
[03:51:25.770 --> 03:51:28.469]  I hope this is utterly demoralizing for the left.
[03:51:28.610 --> 03:51:37.469]  I hope that they realize that it doesn't matter how many times you call us racist, how many smears you come up with, how many lies you run with, how many scandals you fabricate from whole cloth.
[03:51:37.930 --> 03:51:38.670]  It doesn't work.
[03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:40.069]  The American people have risen up.
[03:51:40.129 --> 03:51:40.969]  So you can shut up now.
[03:51:41.049 --> 03:51:41.790]  You can just shut up.
[03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:43.309]  You can stop all of your little tricks.
[03:51:43.489 --> 03:51:44.889]  You can stop all of your little scams.
[03:51:45.129 --> 03:51:46.270]  It's got to be exhausting.
[03:51:46.270 --> 03:51:48.510]  You put a lot of work into it and you fail.
[03:51:48.690 --> 03:51:49.270]  So enough.
[03:51:49.489 --> 03:51:50.270]  Go away.
[03:51:50.549 --> 03:51:51.309]  Leave us alone.
[03:51:51.709 --> 03:51:52.430]  Shut up.
[03:51:52.569 --> 03:51:55.270]  I'm not trying to be rude here, but it's time.
[03:51:55.430 --> 03:51:55.829]  It's time.
[03:51:56.430 --> 03:51:57.829]  And come to our side.
[03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:58.510]  We're not going to bite.
[03:51:58.709 --> 03:51:59.110]  Of course.
[03:51:59.370 --> 03:52:02.950]  We just want to have prosperity and victory for everybody.
[03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:04.270]  That's how it should be.
[03:52:04.690 --> 03:52:05.149]  That's it.
[03:52:05.270 --> 03:52:05.950]  It's very simple.
[03:52:06.049 --> 03:52:10.829]  And you're right about the, I mean, this is the unity ticket, RFK Junior, Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:52:11.129 --> 03:52:12.649]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[03:52:12.889 --> 03:52:14.690]  Nicole Shanahan has been absolutely incredible.
[03:52:14.930 --> 03:52:16.930]  This really feels like the dawning of a new age.
[03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:19.129]  It feels like the awakening has happened.
[03:52:19.250 --> 03:52:24.569]  I mean, the fact you have Elon Musk and Ron Paul now on the same team with...
[03:52:24.569 --> 03:52:25.889]  Stop the censorship and end the Fed.
[03:52:26.010 --> 03:52:26.469]  Oh my God.
[03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:29.709]  I mean, this is more than we could have ever hoped for.
[03:52:29.829 --> 03:52:32.409]  I mean, could you ever imagine such a thing happening just 10 years ago?
[03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:33.069]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:52:33.090 --> 03:52:34.489]  These people don't realize what's going to happen.
[03:52:34.920 --> 03:52:36.459]  That are all crying about this.
[03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:39.540]  They have no idea how good their life's gonna get from this point on.
[03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:41.579]  And all we have to do is keep...
[03:52:41.579 --> 03:52:42.780]  We have to not let up.
[03:52:42.899 --> 03:52:47.620]  We have to realize, oh, we had this one chance, and we won, and we took it, and we grabbed it.
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:49.079]  We grabbed victory.
[03:52:49.079 --> 03:52:52.559]  I'm just proud of Americans and others not being bullied to these psycho demons.
[03:52:52.819 --> 03:52:52.979]  Yeah.
[03:52:53.120 --> 03:52:54.139]  You've been messing with us.
[03:52:54.200 --> 03:52:55.340]  How do you like it back?
[03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:57.500]  You think your intimidation works on us?
[03:52:57.600 --> 03:52:59.920]  It makes us fight you ten times harder!
[03:53:00.409 --> 03:53:05.350]  Yeah, all these people in the media that have lied to us continuously, they should never work again in that field.
[03:53:05.450 --> 03:53:07.709]  They should be gone, because that's all they do is lie.
[03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.709]  Yeah, they're lucky.
[03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:12.510]  It's just like, when we won the Revolutionary War, it's like, just go back to Britain.
[03:53:12.610 --> 03:53:12.790]  Yeah.
[03:53:13.409 --> 03:53:14.250]  Just get out of here.
[03:53:14.350 --> 03:53:15.969]  And look, this is a beachhead.
[03:53:16.629 --> 03:53:18.329]  Tonight, we'll celebrate victory.
[03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:20.450]  We'll celebrate victory for a whole week.
[03:53:20.450 --> 03:53:20.930]  Why not?
[03:53:21.149 --> 03:53:22.969]  But this is when we hit the ground running.
[03:53:23.049 --> 03:53:28.450]  This is when we need to do the things that Trump promised to do, the deportations, the reforming of the election.
[03:53:28.649 --> 03:53:30.959]  I mean, Everything has to start right now.
[03:53:31.120 --> 03:53:31.840]  This is the beachhead.
[03:53:31.860 --> 03:53:32.440]  Total offensive.
[03:53:32.680 --> 03:53:33.799]  The work begins.
[03:53:33.940 --> 03:53:34.959]  It's not over right now.
[03:53:35.020 --> 03:53:35.840]  This is just the beginning.
[03:53:35.979 --> 03:53:37.079]  It's about to get extremely dangerous.
[03:53:37.239 --> 03:53:39.719]  76 days of hell, 79 days of hell, however many it is.
[03:53:39.819 --> 03:53:41.760]  And you know one back in here, we were hugging this stuff on camera.
[03:53:41.840 --> 03:53:42.579]  I'm going to give you a hug, Rob.
[03:53:46.350 --> 03:53:47.750]  We knew we were going to win in Pennsylvania with that crowd.
[03:53:48.049 --> 03:53:48.549]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:53:49.290 --> 03:53:51.510]  I mean, yeah, you totally knew it.
[03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:54.309]  And you could feel it, especially in Pennsylvania.
[03:53:55.309 --> 03:53:56.590]  And that's what they tried to get in.
[03:53:56.989 --> 03:53:57.750]  And they couldn't.
[03:53:57.829 --> 03:53:58.149]  All right.
[03:53:58.629 --> 03:53:59.530]  Here, you get in here, guys.
[03:53:59.649 --> 03:54:00.309]  We'll take some people, some people.
[03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:01.549]  And then I want to get Ellen back in here.
[03:54:01.729 --> 03:54:04.250]  And then we got to, I bet Trump's going to now stand the victory.
[03:54:05.430 --> 03:54:06.469]  Well, got to have him.
[03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:08.229]  I don't even really know what to say.
[03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:18.870]  I think, you know, something I've said about InfoWars and the InfoWars in general a couple of times, which rings true still, and I think always will, is that the InfoWars never won or lost.
[03:54:18.909 --> 03:54:20.549]  You're either winning it or you're losing it.
[03:54:20.690 --> 03:54:20.930]  Right.
[03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:25.149]  And we know what it's felt like to be losing the InfoWars, especially at the beginning of the censorship.
[03:54:25.850 --> 03:54:29.190]  And tonight, we have crossed a threshold into winning.
[03:54:29.309 --> 03:54:32.770]  We probably crossed it months ago, if not years ago, a couple years ago.
[03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:36.120]  But it's obvious now that we've won a major battle.
[03:54:37.420 --> 03:54:38.479]  That is beautiful.
[03:54:38.979 --> 03:54:41.959]  But the war is still being fought.
[03:54:42.700 --> 03:54:44.079]  Oh my gosh.
[03:54:45.020 --> 03:54:46.579]  Is that real gold?
[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:48.500]  That is like 50 pounds.
[03:54:49.079 --> 03:54:50.139]  That is wild.
[03:54:50.440 --> 03:54:52.059]  Oh man, they made it for a child's head.
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:54:55.000]  Yeah, they found it at FCN Island.
[03:54:55.700 --> 03:54:56.360]  That's amazing.
[03:54:57.219 --> 03:54:58.340]  No, you're exactly right.
[03:54:58.659 --> 03:55:00.139]  The Info War will never end.
[03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:06.079]  We'll never be able to declare total victory because the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
[03:55:06.680 --> 03:55:11.700]  Yeah, we just won a major battle, and we can celebrate a little bit, but we've got to watch for those service-terror missiles.
[03:55:12.869 --> 03:55:13.729]  Yeah, seriously.
[03:55:13.969 --> 03:55:14.290]  No, yeah.
[03:55:14.770 --> 03:55:16.250]  Trump is in great danger right now.
[03:55:16.409 --> 03:55:17.809]  We are all in great danger right now.
[03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:23.729]  For some reason, shockingly, they're actually stopping Antifa from rioting in Washington as we speak.
[03:55:23.909 --> 03:55:26.649]  So the leftist gangs, the militias, are already activated.
[03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:29.030]  But it's going to be different this time.
[03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:30.329]  And I truly hope that.
[03:55:30.430 --> 03:55:41.229]  And I truly hope that we have the fortitude to do what is necessary and that we don't surrender to the fake impeachments and the bullcrap that we had to deal with for the first administration.
[03:55:41.229 --> 03:55:42.940]  By the way, Georgia now officially called.
[03:55:43.059 --> 03:55:43.280]  Yep.
[03:55:43.540 --> 03:55:45.000]  An hour after rat murder.
[03:55:45.319 --> 03:55:47.319]  Pennsylvania is just inevitable at this point.
[03:55:47.500 --> 03:55:53.940]  You know, the big difference politically is that a lot of the Republicans in 2016 kind of bought into the bullshit.
[03:55:54.200 --> 03:55:56.020]  They kind of bought into the Russia thing.
[03:55:56.100 --> 03:55:56.940]  They were kind of scared.
[03:55:57.500 --> 03:55:59.659]  And so we don't have that anymore.
[03:55:59.780 --> 03:56:01.739]  They know all the attacks against Trump are illegitimate.
[03:56:02.739 --> 03:56:08.819]  By the way, you know, some of the things Trump needs to do day one, we got a pardon, freed the January 6th political prisoners.
[03:56:09.120 --> 03:56:09.559]  Yes.
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:14.100]  We need to change our election system, get rid of mail-in ballots, go back to paper ballots.
[03:56:14.219 --> 03:56:14.860]  Trump knows that.
[03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:19.069]  We've got to start freeing our energy.
[03:56:19.569 --> 03:56:21.209]  I mean, there's so many things overnight.
[03:56:21.370 --> 03:56:22.129]  Shut down the border.
[03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:24.069]  I mean, day one, he's going to have a lot of things.
[03:56:24.190 --> 03:56:26.209]  And with this decisive victory, there's a mandate.
[03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:27.590]  And he's got Senate and the House now.
[03:56:27.729 --> 03:56:29.110]  But you know what the brilliant thing is?
[03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:36.989]  All of these problems that we have to deal with day in and day out, all of these existential issues that are just confronting us daily, the solutions are so simple.
[03:56:37.049 --> 03:56:38.149]  You shut the border.
[03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:39.729]  You start the deportations.
[03:56:39.729 --> 03:56:40.989]  You get rid of the mail-in ballots.
[03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:42.950]  I mean, these are not insurmountable problems.
[03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:44.090]  It's a matter of choice.
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:48.479]  Four years to do everything wrong to destroy this country.
[03:56:48.620 --> 03:56:52.819]  Not us, but the people in power have made that choice on purpose, by design.
[03:56:53.139 --> 03:56:55.280]  It's just a matter of making a different choice.
[03:56:55.379 --> 03:56:56.959]  America got off its knees today.
[03:56:57.479 --> 03:56:59.159]  And we're taking our country back.
[03:56:59.379 --> 03:57:00.239]  In a huge way.
[03:57:00.440 --> 03:57:03.819]  And I wonder what the final tally for Trump is going to be tonight.
[03:57:05.540 --> 03:57:06.680]  Where are we at right now?
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:07.920]  65 million.
[03:57:10.520 --> 03:57:13.059]  So the popular vote still in play.
[03:57:14.549 --> 03:57:22.110]  I think that, again, I'm thinking plus two, plus three in the Senate is probably a realistic number at this point.
[03:57:22.209 --> 03:57:25.049]  I was about to say, we got our five minutes of celebration.
[03:57:25.229 --> 03:57:27.409]  We got to start taking calls and talking to other folks.
[03:57:27.709 --> 03:57:30.350]  Men, battle stations, get back in your studio.
[03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:31.510]  Give us the data from there.
[03:57:31.690 --> 03:57:33.049]  Let's continue on.
[03:57:33.719 --> 03:57:35.379]  Let's get Roger Stone, General Flynn.
[03:57:35.479 --> 03:57:36.319]  Let's get them all on.
[03:57:36.399 --> 03:57:37.040]  Let's do it!
[03:57:37.219 --> 03:57:38.659]  We just had our celebration.
[03:57:39.020 --> 03:57:40.120]  Now to battle stations.
[03:57:40.120 --> 03:57:42.420]  We gotta start wargaming the next enemy attack.
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:43.100]  Let's go!
[03:57:43.260 --> 03:57:43.620]  Go!
[03:57:43.819 --> 03:57:44.120]  Go!
[03:57:44.299 --> 03:57:44.639]  Go!
[03:57:44.819 --> 03:57:45.120]  Go!
[03:57:45.440 --> 03:57:45.620]  Go!
[03:57:46.059 --> 03:57:46.500]  Yes!
[03:57:47.040 --> 03:57:47.940]  All right!
[03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:58.450]  I promise you, globalists, the last thing I do, I'm going to politically crush your neck and pop your eyeballs out of your head.
[03:57:58.889 --> 03:58:04.110]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:58:05.170 --> 03:58:08.670]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:58:08.850 --> 03:58:11.489]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:12.370]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:58:13.329 --> 03:58:14.670]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:15.750]  Don't tell me eating right.
[03:58:15.850 --> 03:58:16.469]  I'm not going to bite it.
[03:58:16.889 --> 03:58:17.190]  Oh!
[03:58:17.219 --> 03:58:20.120]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:58:20.559 --> 03:58:21.959]  Oh, no.
[03:58:22.979 --> 03:58:24.819]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:58:25.180 --> 03:58:30.920]  Well, I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:31.860]  That's why, right here.
[03:58:32.620 --> 03:58:37.719]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:58:37.840 --> 03:58:39.500]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:58:39.780 --> 03:58:41.440]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:58:44.209 --> 03:58:48.110]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:51.010]  And I am doing a plug here because, you know, we could be shut down.
[03:58:51.190 --> 03:58:51.690]  I'm going to get it.
[03:58:52.030 --> 03:58:54.870]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:58:55.049 --> 03:58:58.209]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
