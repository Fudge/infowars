[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:08.632]  Separately, what concerns do you have about Vice President Harris' ability to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket?
[00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:09.452]  Wow.
[00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:16.255]  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be Vice President, so I think she's not qualified to be President.
[00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:17.655]  So let's start there.
[00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:19.236]  Number one.
[00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:28.082]  The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president.
[00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:31.565]  I beat him once and I will beat him again.
[00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.266]  So he just said he met with Putin today?
[00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:33.707]  Secondly.
[00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:41.112]  And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine who has as much courage as he has determination.
[00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:42.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
[00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:52.467]  The president will hold a press conference, I guess a big boy press conference is what we're calling it.
[00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:53.888]  A big boy press conference.
[00:00:53.908 --> 00:01:00.313]  Oh, I am a big boy, a big boy, a big boy.
[00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:04.836]  Oh, I am a big boy and this is what I do.
[00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:09.459]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.200]  You answered every question.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.141]  You knew all the
[00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.131]  They're describing it at the White House as a big boy press conference.
[00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:28.131]  2, 10, 12, 15.
[00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:31.292]  Pope's stepping on them.
[00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:32.293]  It's black.
[00:01:55.034 --> 00:02:12.240]  Well, one way to stop getting people to focus on him being 81 and possibly having issues with his acuity is just to call him a big boy.
[00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.282]  This version of Biden is the best Biden ever.
[00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:23.885]  In fact, I think he's better than he's ever been.
[00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.826]  President Biden has a photographic memory.
[00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:32.969]  His understanding and mastery of a complicated geopolitical situation is remarkable.
[00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.672]  He is sharp, intensely probing, and detail-oriented and focused.
[00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:44.635]  I was sitting, you know, two feet from him across the table, and he was, you know, intense.
[00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.596]  He's had trouble walking sometimes.
[00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:47.016]  Yeah, so
[00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.658]  They say he's sharp in meetings and so on.
[00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:52.220]  Very lucid, very well informed.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.263]  Biden is state lead, he comes with gravitas.
[00:02:58.224 --> 00:03:12.535]  Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with dealing with everything we have to do with...
[00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:19.218]  We finally beat Medicare.
[00:03:19.538 --> 00:03:22.680]  We're finally providing housing for black Americans.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:31.725]  The impact on the choice, the idea that they're gonna, I'm not, I've been proposing that
[00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.360]  Everybody, they pay, the millionaires pay 1%, 1%.
[00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:41.650]  So no one after, I've not raised the cost of Social Security for anybody.
[00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.096]  Kareem, I got my handicap, which when I was Vice President, down to a six.
[00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:59.763]  He wants to get rid of the ability of Medicare for the ability for us to be able to negotiate drug prices with the big pharma companies.
[00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:01.784]  What I'm going to do is fix the taxes.
[00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:04.785]  For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America.
[00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:07.526]  Not even billionaires in America.
[00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:08.566]  No one was hurt.
[00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:12.387]  No one Israeli was accidentally killed and it just stopped.
[00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:24.290]  And I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
[00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.331]  What did he just say?
[00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:32.152]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:37.126]  I know.
[00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:43.573]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:58.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is live coverage from the War Room with your host, Owen Schroyer.
[00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:05.213]  Here's truly Alex Jones of the vaunted first press conference of three and a half years by the big boy.
[00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:08.594]  And we're going to play a clip in a moment while we're waiting for him to get on screen.
[00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:13.375]  He's a little bit late, obviously, probably taking a methamphetamine or Adderall shake right now.
[00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:19.077]  But obviously earlier today, he called the dictator of Ukraine Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:21.158]  So it just gets richer and richer.
[00:06:21.198 --> 00:06:21.998]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:30.158]  And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination.
[00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:32.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
[00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.400]  President Putin.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.300]  He's gonna beat President Putin.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.821]  President Zelensky.
[00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:38.721]  Oh my God.
[00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:41.622]  I'm so focused on beating Putin, we gotta worry about it.
[00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:42.302]  Anyway.
[00:06:42.762 --> 00:06:43.803]  Alright, alright.
[00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:47.504]  Oh, and I think we should play that twice without me laughing, and you can respond.
[00:06:47.524 --> 00:06:47.844]  No, no, no.
[00:06:47.864 --> 00:06:48.904]  Good luck not laughing, though.
[00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:50.865]  Roll it two times back to back.
[00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:52.929]  This is another cheap fake.
[00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:53.729]  Hold on a minute.
[00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:55.070]  This is fake, folks.
[00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.550]  It's not real.
[00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.171]  No, it is real.
[00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:56.491]  He did it.
[00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:56.971]  They admit it.
[00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:58.072]  This is not a cheap fake.
[00:06:58.092 --> 00:06:58.452]  Here it is.
[00:06:59.412 --> 00:07:06.117]  And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination.
[00:07:06.517 --> 00:07:07.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
[00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.259]  President Putin.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.420]  He's gonna beat President Putin.
[00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:13.781]  President Zelensky.
[00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:17.584]  I'm so focused on beating Putin, we gotta worry about it.
[00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:18.224]  Anyway.
[00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:20.246]  Mr. President, I'm better.
[00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.767]  You are a hell of a lot better.
[00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:29.571]  And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination.
[00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
[00:07:32.013 --> 00:07:37.356]  You know, if you go to my ex-account, I did an imitation yesterday that's gone viral of what Biden acted like in the debate.
[00:07:37.376 --> 00:07:38.517]  Maybe we can show the B-roll of that.
[00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:40.638]  But let's punch up the live debate feed.
[00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:41.638]  Is he out there yet?
[00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:43.079]  Nope?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.401]  Next up, big boy.
[00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:46.958]  Press conference.
[00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:48.599]  Owen, you're hosting the War Room here.
[00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:55.525]  We're going to continue on commercial free now, even after the show ends in 27 and a half minutes here.
[00:07:55.565 --> 00:08:03.091]  But you were saying, as we were doing the little promo break there, that if he doesn't go more than 30 minutes, this is not a big boy press conference.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.382]  Yeah, I think anything less than 30 minutes is basically a white flag.
[00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:08.643]  I can't do it.
[00:08:08.763 --> 00:08:09.483]  I can't hack it.
[00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:10.323]  I can't make it.
[00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.804]  I can't go longer than 30 minutes.
[00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:12.625]  That's a white flag.
[00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:27.912]  And, you know, the most recent times where he's been forced to basically make a statement when there's been big things happening, like when all the riots were happening, when there's things that break out in the Middle East, in Israel, in Ukraine, he's basically forced to make a statement.
[00:08:27.972 --> 00:08:29.333]  He never goes longer than 10 minutes.
[00:08:29.373 --> 00:08:31.334]  I mean, normally you're thinking 30 minutes.
[00:08:31.374 --> 00:08:32.495]  You're making a big statement.
[00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:34.236]  He can't do more than 10 minutes.
[00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:40.418]  So, I mean, I'm looking at this big boy press conference, 30 minutes minimum, probably an hour worth of questions.
[00:08:40.738 --> 00:08:44.079]  But we're also talking about a guy who hasn't done a press conference in over a year.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.761]  So, he's got a lot to answer for.
[00:08:47.821 --> 00:08:48.981]  I don't even care if it's scripted.
[00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:51.042]  It can be 100% scripted.
[00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.843]  He still has to make it longer than 30 minutes.
[00:08:55.383 --> 00:08:58.946]  You know, kids, roaches, hair.
[00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:01.848]  I'm batting my legs and they rub my legs down.
[00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:02.569]  Corn pop.
[00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:04.030]  I don't know how bad.
[00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.234]  I think this is going to be a disaster and maybe it's meant to be a disaster.
[00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:11.296]  Oh, this is a real photo from this morning.
[00:09:11.336 --> 00:09:12.077]  Give the audio, Alex.
[00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:12.757]  Don't laugh at this.
[00:09:12.997 --> 00:09:13.858]  This is very serious.
[00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:14.739]  Roll the audio.
[00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:15.980]  Yeah, I'm a big boy.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.941]  That's a big boy, sir.
[00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:19.442]  I'm a big boy.
[00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:21.224]  I took a big boy poop.
[00:09:21.864 --> 00:09:22.205]  Yes.
[00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:24.186]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:25.227]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:26.048]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:31.974]  Ladies and gentlemen, Operation... You know, we joke about this, but it's so sad for our country, but they're looking at the numbers.
[00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:33.556]  There's almost no way to remove him now.
[00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:35.478]  Multiple states can't get him off the ballot now.
[00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.180]  It looks like we are stuck with Big Boy.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.382]  They basically have two weeks, Alex.
[00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.284]  I mean, you're looking at a two-week deadline.
[00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:45.348]  That's why they wanted to push up, because they were first going to do a virtual
[00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:52.853]  Ceremonious nomination because their DNC in Chicago in mid-August is too late.
[00:09:52.973 --> 00:09:53.353]  I like that.
[00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:54.193]  Ceremonious.
[00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.654]  It was just going to be a ceremony.
[00:09:55.674 --> 00:09:58.616]  Well, I guess really the convention would be the ceremonious thing.
[00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:01.337]  Virtually nominating him would be the official thing.
[00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:04.319]  But they had to do that before July 27th.
[00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:05.720]  So they were going to do it late July.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:12.503]  Then they were saying, well, now we need to do it July 21st to get this thing done because of all the calls for his removal.
[00:10:12.523 --> 00:10:13.524]  The big boy's refusing.
[00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:20.812]  Well, I don't know if Big Boy knows what's going on, but they might need a Rabbi Schmully insert.
[00:10:20.952 --> 00:10:25.217]  And even NBC News had mentioned what we were saying years ago with Roger Shull and his great sources.
[00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:28.380]  Jill is basically the president and the chief of staff is Hunter.
[00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.144]  So we have a crackhead lunatic as the chief of staff right now.
[00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:34.646]  And people say, well, don't worry, he's still a puppet.
[00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:38.970]  Yeah, but even foreign governments try to call the Pentagon or try to talk to the CIA.
[00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.512]  It's been years since they've talked to, like, the Russians and people.
[00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.874]  And the Chinese say they get a call, like, every three months.
[00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:45.935]  Like, usually the U.S.
[00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:47.656]  government's talking, like, every five minutes to other governments.
[00:10:47.976 --> 00:10:49.578]  There's, like, just stillness.
[00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:52.480]  I like that sound.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.965]  Like, you're not old enough, but when we were younger, at midnight, they'd play the Star Spangled Banner, and then we'd just put up a TV symbol there, and we'd go,
[00:11:02.447 --> 00:11:06.771]  Well, Kirby just admitted it, that Joe Biden can't get up at night.
[00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:09.954]  Orban is about to meet with President Trump.
[00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:11.455]  He won't meet with Biden.
[00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.496]  Biden didn't answer the call.
[00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.378]  So Orban is about to meet with President Trump.
[00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:23.186]  And they're concerned, the media is panicking right now, that Orban is basically acting as an intermediary between Putin and Trump.
[00:11:23.687 --> 00:11:24.768]  And this is why they signed that deal.
[00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:27.068]  We're good to go.
[00:11:45.868 --> 00:11:49.551]  I mean, he spent, when he was president, like eight hours a day on the phone.
[00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:52.013]  That's real power, is being able to call people when you're the president.
[00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.915]  Talking to world leaders, you name it, calling my wife up, calling me up.
[00:11:55.395 --> 00:11:59.538]  I mean, can you imagine the energy Trump has versus this guy that won't even talk to world leaders?
[00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:03.301]  Well, he's actually a sociable person, and he's a likable person.
[00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.923]  He has a big personality, and so that's why- He is a big boy.
[00:12:06.504 --> 00:12:07.384]  He's the real big boy.
[00:12:07.424 --> 00:12:10.627]  Well, Biden is the big guy, but now he's the big boy.
[00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:11.488]  So he's actually been-
[00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.510]  He's actually been taken down.
[00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.173]  So now it's 10% to the big boy.
[00:12:15.293 --> 00:12:16.856]  Big boy might only get 5% now.
[00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:21.143]  I don't know, big boy, big boy, big guy gets 10%, big boy only gets 5.
[00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:24.528]  He's already six minutes late.
[00:12:25.148 --> 00:12:26.969]  Look, I thought they'd actually have him out on time.
[00:12:27.729 --> 00:12:28.910]  I told you he'd be late.
[00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.051]  You said that he would be late.
[00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:34.713]  He was just at that meeting with Zelensky, so I was figuring, alright, they'll have him doped up and ready to go.
[00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:38.675]  The last two statements he made, he was right on time, walking out of the doors.
[00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:40.896]  So, he's already seven minutes late.
[00:12:40.996 --> 00:12:42.257]  I wonder how bad this is gonna get.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.981]  Should we play the Jeopardy music?
[00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:47.562]  I don't know, we might be playing it all day.
[00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:50.903]  It could be a long process.
[00:12:50.923 --> 00:12:51.604]  Well, you know what?
[00:12:51.924 --> 00:12:57.386]  Let's just go ahead and play him just hours ago saying he was introducing President Putin.
[00:12:57.406 --> 00:13:00.768]  I think Putin's laughing.
[00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:02.488]  I think he's probably crying.
[00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:03.268]  This is very dangerous.
[00:13:03.528 --> 00:13:07.471]  You know the United States is now moving long-range missiles, hypersonic missiles, into Eastern Europe?
[00:13:07.732 --> 00:13:11.194]  Yeah, and they also said they're giving missiles to Germany, and Russia responded.
[00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.536]  Putin said we view that as an act of war.
[00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:16.258]  Biden already said if we give F-16s it's an act of war.
[00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:17.419]  Now they're sending F-16s.
[00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:20.461]  And now they're sending hypersonic missiles as cruise missiles.
[00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:24.444]  And let me tell you, they don't put vanilla ice cream cones on top of those.
[00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:25.565]  They put nuclear weapons on them.
[00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:40.374]  So, and again, I didn't like the communist Russians, I'm not a Russophile, but Kennedy, the Pentagon, his first year in office put Nike missiles in Turkey, medium-range missiles,
[00:13:41.457 --> 00:13:47.582]  Well, think about how corrupt the media is today compared to them, that that was actually a big news story then.
[00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:50.644]  We basically just had Cuban Missile Crisis 2.0, they didn't even mention it.
[00:14:08.058 --> 00:14:10.280]  They just didn't even cover it because they got to protect Biden.
[00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:11.461]  That's right.
[00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:18.147]  Now there's Russian nuke subs that are always there, but now they're popping up off the coast of Miami doing nuclear attack drills.
[00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:18.568]  Yeah.
[00:14:18.768 --> 00:14:23.032]  Because our government, and again folks, if the Russians did wrong, I don't care.
[00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:28.217]  I talk to CHICOMS all the time because they're actually in our grill, okay, and control much of Congress like Swallow's Well.
[00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:32.260]  The Russians have no flex when it comes to political manipulation.
[00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:33.582]  They do have a bunch of nuclear weapons.
[00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:35.515]  So, and that's what Putin said.
[00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:36.695]  He said, we can barely run our own countries.
[00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:37.696]  Three times the size of the U.S.
[00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.077]  We're trying to stabilize our country.
[00:14:39.097 --> 00:14:40.318]  We don't want to get any more land.
[00:14:40.538 --> 00:14:41.719]  They're not going to invade Europe.
[00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.141]  Yeah, they've got enough land, they don't even know what to do with most of it.
[00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:46.982]  They've got plenty of resources.
[00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:51.605]  The only place that's got more resources than Africa, and that's a bunch of countries, it's a whole continent, is Russia.
[00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.868]  Russia's bigger than Africa, and it's the only, I mean, there's two places that's got all the resources.
[00:14:56.738 --> 00:15:02.160]  I mean, you talk about oil, diamonds, rare earth minerals, timber, uranium, I mean, everything.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.941]  Russia has everything, but strangely enough, they don't have helium.
[00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:11.683]  Which, for some reason, there was a shortage of, and now they're claiming that they found more.
[00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:13.343]  I know NASA uses a bunch of helium.
[00:15:13.803 --> 00:15:17.545]  But, you know, I think they keep making this claim, like, oh, Russia will go into Europe.
[00:15:17.605 --> 00:15:18.065]  I don't think so.
[00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:21.226]  I think the farthest Russia would like to go- But be a nuclear war!
[00:15:21.586 --> 00:15:24.927]  They only did it because the West started a war in Ukraine, a proxy war.
[00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:29.791]  I think Russia wanted to free Eastern Ukraine from the grips of the Kiev regime.
[00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:31.752]  They've done that, for the most part.
[00:15:31.912 --> 00:15:37.477]  And I think Russia wanted Crimea, because it is nutrient-dense land and great property.
[00:15:38.217 --> 00:15:39.258]  What's Crimea?
[00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.462]  Russia was founded a thousand years ago by Slav the Wise.
[00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:46.644]  So, that's where Russia comes from.
[00:15:46.664 --> 00:15:47.945]  I've never met your mother.
[00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:48.506]  What's her first name?
[00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:49.507]  Annette.
[00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:52.229]  So, would you be mad if people kidnapped Annette?
[00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:53.562]  Yes.
[00:15:54.242 --> 00:15:58.104]  But that's where Russia comes from, is Ukraine.
[00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:00.265]  So that's the issue.
[00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:03.867]  It's not like even if the Russians took over New York City, we'd be pissed.
[00:16:04.207 --> 00:16:07.948]  We've had that for 400 years, basically, where New York is now, 300 years.
[00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.690]  That's where Russia was started.
[00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.350]  I know you know that, Owen.
[00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:17.473]  Yeah, well, don't try to give this history lesson like Putin did with Tucker Carlson.
[00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:19.854]  He did do that, didn't he?
[00:16:21.084 --> 00:16:23.586]  So, can we, let's just see it one more time.
[00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:24.246]  Here he is.
[00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:25.567]  Hey, thank God.
[00:16:25.587 --> 00:16:27.189]  In fact, I've told people to post on my ex.
[00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:29.030]  People say, am I the guy posting on ex?
[00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:29.891]  Yeah.
[00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:30.731]  95% of the posts are me.
[00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:31.972]  That's why there's typos all over it.
[00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:36.215]  Plus the voice to print thing has even more mistakes than me writing it.
[00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:38.477]  95% of the time it's me, but like, I'll give them a headline, they'll write it.
[00:16:38.777 --> 00:16:44.922]  I did just tell him 10 minutes before he went on, I said, hey, put that clip out of him saying that, you know, thank you, President Putin.
[00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:48.304]  And just say, thank God Biden finally met with Putin.
[00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:50.001]  He thinks he did.
[00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:50.982]  Oh my God.
[00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:52.223]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:52.243 --> 00:16:52.803]  There it is.
[00:16:53.483 --> 00:16:55.484]  Biden caught... That's not the headline I said, guys.
[00:16:55.504 --> 00:16:56.005]  Put it back up.
[00:16:58.466 --> 00:16:59.327]  Okay, I love everybody.
[00:16:59.507 --> 00:17:02.588]  Leave that up and put it... I don't care if you put it up twice.
[00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.550]  Just put it out again saying, thank God Biden's finally talking to Putin.
[00:17:07.511 --> 00:17:08.531]  That's what I asked for.
[00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:11.633]  See, I said I write the tweets, but then inadvertently they didn't listen to me.
[00:17:11.653 --> 00:17:12.253]  That's not my tweet.
[00:17:12.474 --> 00:17:12.934]  And I'm not mad.
[00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:14.821]  I'm not mad.
[00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:17.843]  Robbie was all excited because I walked in and I go, hey, get on my Twitter.
[00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:20.864]  Well, you know, comb my hair, what's left of it and brush my teeth.
[00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:25.807]  So when I got something to eat with my family and I said, hey, put up there that thank God Biden's finally meeting with Putin.
[00:17:26.327 --> 00:17:28.468]  And he goes, oh, I'll say we caught him with it.
[00:17:28.508 --> 00:17:29.428]  I said, no, no, no.
[00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:31.149]  The dude did what he wanted.
[00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.850]  You see that right there?
[00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:34.771]  I don't care.
[00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:35.611]  Don't delete the tweet.
[00:17:35.852 --> 00:17:36.472]  Insurrectionist.
[00:17:36.772 --> 00:17:37.612]  Yeah, he's an insurrectionist.
[00:17:37.712 --> 00:17:38.293]  Absolutely.
[00:17:39.253 --> 00:17:40.454]  So I'm not writing these tweets now.
[00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:42.511]  It's updated.
[00:17:42.571 --> 00:17:43.271]  Okay, let's see it now.
[00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:44.932]  You don't need to erase the tweet.
[00:17:44.952 --> 00:17:45.632]  Just put it out again.
[00:17:46.472 --> 00:17:48.453]  Thank God Biden's finally meeting with Putin.
[00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:49.853]  Maybe we can stop World War III.
[00:17:50.594 --> 00:17:51.174]  That'd be nice.
[00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:53.655]  He's now 12 minutes late.
[00:17:54.135 --> 00:17:55.915]  Is Biden in the room, or are you farting?
[00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:56.716]  This is just bad.
[00:17:56.736 --> 00:17:58.296]  A dude just walked in the room.
[00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:01.437]  A dude is the one that walks in the room, and now you're going to blame me?
[00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:02.137]  No, I know dude.
[00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:02.838]  That's a dude fart.
[00:18:04.378 --> 00:18:05.298]  Is that not horrible?
[00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:09.040]  You know, they say who smelted Delta, but I know that's dude.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.220]  I've been on that road for a while.
[00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:12.450]  I'm actually on a secret mission with him.
[00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.431]  This is what happens when Biden shows up late.
[00:18:14.451 --> 00:18:15.092]  Can you imagine?
[00:18:15.192 --> 00:18:16.773]  He is the worst farting on airplanes.
[00:18:16.853 --> 00:18:17.474]  Rob, get in here.
[00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:18.274]  Oh my God.
[00:18:18.935 --> 00:18:20.636]  Don't put him on blast.
[00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:22.297]  Zoom in on the culprit.
[00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:24.999]  Where is Joe Biden?
[00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.260]  You fart in the control room.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.621]  I blame Joe Biden.
[00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:29.282]  God, you're right.
[00:18:29.322 --> 00:18:30.203]  That's our Rob, dude.
[00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:30.863]  Oh my God.
[00:18:31.303 --> 00:18:33.405]  I've known Rob too long and I know what his farts smell like.
[00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.146]  This is what happens when Biden... It's like we're married.
[00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:37.328]  What's going to happen if Biden's another 10 minutes late?
[00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:40.624]  Don't even, look at his guilty face.
[00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:41.705]  You're right.
[00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:42.926]  Zoom, you're right.
[00:18:43.026 --> 00:18:43.426]  Zoom in.
[00:18:44.928 --> 00:18:45.508]  You see that?
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.891]  That is a guilty... It's Rob Dew.
[00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:49.052]  That, that's you.
[00:18:50.173 --> 00:18:50.633]  It's Rob Dew.
[00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:52.876]  Oh, if it was you, Owen, your farts smell just like Dews.
[00:18:53.176 --> 00:18:53.917]  Oh my gosh.
[00:18:54.797 --> 00:18:56.679]  I haven't known Dew long enough for that to be going on.
[00:18:56.759 --> 00:19:03.466]  Now maybe just looking at Joe Biden's blue screen, maybe... Joe Biden, well he is, do you think Biden is going to wear a diaper tonight?
[00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:06.409]  Yes, I think so.
[00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:07.290]  I look like a dead animal in here.
[00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.791]  I think Biden wears a diaper.
[00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:11.432]  How viral is this Rob Dew?
[00:19:12.013 --> 00:19:13.634]  This is going to be fun.
[00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:14.814]  This is good for Rob's future.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.757]  He's going to make something out of this now.
[00:19:19.377 --> 00:19:21.058]  I'm going to be stuck on an airplane with him this weekend.
[00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:22.859]  Nothing worse.
[00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:24.280]  Oh my gosh.
[00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:26.812]  Oh my gosh.
[00:19:26.852 --> 00:19:28.453]  My first bulldog died a few years ago.
[00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:29.994]  It's the only creature with worse farts.
[00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:35.099]  May he rest in peace.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:36.860]  Captain.
[00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:39.902]  I remember you were broken up after that.
[00:19:39.922 --> 00:19:40.363]  I remember that.
[00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:42.929]  Rob, I'm sorry.
[00:19:42.969 --> 00:19:44.311]  Let's look at how guilty Rob looks.
[00:19:44.571 --> 00:19:45.472]  Alright, alright.
[00:19:45.993 --> 00:19:47.215]  Over-under at this point.
[00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.397]  Biden now 15 minutes late.
[00:19:50.178 --> 00:19:50.759]  Over-under.
[00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:52.061]  I mean, how late is he going to be?
[00:19:52.662 --> 00:19:53.603]  Well, let's double check.
[00:19:53.623 --> 00:19:56.487]  Because first they said 5.30 Eastern, then they said 6 Eastern.
[00:19:56.547 --> 00:19:57.768]  Yeah, they already delayed it an hour.
[00:19:58.609 --> 00:19:59.471]  It's twice today.
[00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:00.071]  First they said...
[00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:01.625]  Yeah.
[00:20:01.665 --> 00:20:02.726]  He's just late.
[00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.551]  Biden's just late.
[00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:22.132]  He must have had a disaster.
[00:20:22.553 --> 00:20:24.515]  He must have had a serious problem.
[00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:25.676]  Must have done a Rob Doo.
[00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:26.797]  Well, I don't know.
[00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:27.538]  It's something worse.
[00:20:28.138 --> 00:20:28.959]  I'm thinking something worse.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.881]  Probably a Jerry Nadler.
[00:20:31.422 --> 00:20:33.904]  Wasn't it Nadler that had a... Oh yeah.
[00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:34.585]  Pooped himself?
[00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:35.846]  Absolutely.
[00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:36.387]  He had a Nadler.
[00:20:36.427 --> 00:20:37.468]  I think Biden had a Nadler.
[00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:39.410]  Hey, we're presidential material.
[00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.511]  This is a big boy.
[00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:42.252]  This is a big boy press conference.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:55.890]  Alright, let's, let, let, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[00:21:06.363 --> 00:21:07.503]  I'm gonna beat President Putin.
[00:21:08.063 --> 00:21:08.884]  President Zelensky.
[00:21:09.904 --> 00:21:12.685]  I'm so focused on beating Putin, we gotta worry about it.
[00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:13.185]  Beat Putin?
[00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.025]  What does that even mean?
[00:21:14.205 --> 00:21:15.365]  I'm better.
[00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:16.245]  Is that a threat?
[00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:16.906]  Nice.
[00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:18.846]  By the way, what is this deal, Alex?
[00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:20.966]  That is the biggest gaffe you can do.
[00:21:21.026 --> 00:21:27.508]  Introducing a leader in wartime, face-to-face, and getting the name wrong, and introducing him as the name of the archenemy.
[00:21:27.528 --> 00:21:35.390]  It'd be like if Churchill was introducing in England during World War II, let's say, Theodore Roosevelt.
[00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:41.753]  Roosevelt was his cousin, so now I'm turning to Biden.
[00:21:43.674 --> 00:21:44.414]  The other Roosevelt.
[00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:48.796]  And imagine he's introducing the other Roosevelt, and he introduces him as Hitler.
[00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:52.698]  Joining me in studio now is Cenk Uygur.
[00:21:52.738 --> 00:21:53.398]  Cenk, how you doing?
[00:21:55.619 --> 00:22:00.602]  You know, if I was world dictator, I would pass a law we could service donkeys.
[00:22:03.317 --> 00:22:04.077]  That's, yeah.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:07.298]  They'll probably actually, it's Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:13.040]  Imagine if Teddy Roosevelt was introduced by Churchill at, say, the Yalta Summit as Adolf Hitler.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.361]  You know, that is almost so bad you can't even believe it.
[00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:18.202]  Like, think about it.
[00:22:18.682 --> 00:22:25.424]  The whole, this whole purpose is to try to revamp Joe Biden, save Joe Biden as the candidate,
[00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:28.866]  And before the press conference happens, he has his biggest moment.
[00:22:28.886 --> 00:22:30.107]  He calls Zelensky Putin.
[00:22:30.668 --> 00:22:32.129]  That's almost, like, scripted.
[00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:37.853]  Like, did he do it in, like, is that the, like... It's almost like Rob coming in here and doing what he did.
[00:22:39.214 --> 00:22:43.517]  So you just called him... Definitely deliberate.
[00:22:43.557 --> 00:22:49.342]  You just called Zelensky Putin, and now you're going to be more than 20 minutes late to your own press conference.
[00:22:50.743 --> 00:22:51.464]  He's good, though.
[00:22:51.484 --> 00:22:51.904]  He's fine.
[00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:53.025]  Smartest guy I've ever met.
[00:22:54.497 --> 00:22:59.941]  Well, you know, I promised my wife, I guess what you guessed, I said, I'm at this press conference, it only goes about 45 minutes.
[00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:04.164]  So I kind of sped off early to have an early dinner with her and my younger daughter and my middle daughter.
[00:23:04.904 --> 00:23:08.186]  And then I left early from dinner down the street.
[00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:11.849]  And she goes, Oh, you'll be you'll be up till nine o'clock.
[00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:12.689]  You'll be home at nine.
[00:23:12.729 --> 00:23:14.090]  I said, No, I swear, I'll come home.
[00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.912]  We'll, we'll get in the pool in the backyard.
[00:23:15.992 --> 00:23:16.292]  I will.
[00:23:16.672 --> 00:23:17.913]  I promise we'll light.
[00:23:17.933 --> 00:23:19.534]  She goes, You won't be back for three hours.
[00:23:19.594 --> 00:23:20.515]  I said, Okay, sweetheart, we'll see.
[00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:23.437]  And now we probably won't be because he is not going to get up there.
[00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:25.365]  I really wonder.
[00:23:25.425 --> 00:23:26.606]  I'm locked in here with Rob Deer.
[00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:30.667]  I don't know about gas chambers in World War II, but they exist here.
[00:23:31.707 --> 00:23:32.968]  The doors here are wooden, Alex.
[00:23:34.428 --> 00:23:34.989]  Oh my God!
[00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:36.509]  We've got a camera shot?
[00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:37.870]  It's about to start.
[00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.550]  Are these his speech writers?
[00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:41.711]  So, we are now...
[00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:44.663]  Biden expected to speak soon.
[00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.063]  We're now 19 minutes late.
[00:23:46.743 --> 00:23:47.744]  Expected to speak soon.
[00:23:47.784 --> 00:23:48.684]  Nobody knows what that means.
[00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:52.166]  They can't even get the flags straight.
[00:23:52.186 --> 00:23:53.827]  They're trying to figure out what to do with the flags.
[00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:57.988]  I mean, that's just, they can't even get the flags symmetrical.
[00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:01.790]  My goodness.
[00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:05.692]  How are they so unprepared?
[00:24:08.198 --> 00:24:09.979]  Hey, go shuffle around in the background.
[00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:11.159]  Go shuffle around, you know.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.420]  Let's not make it look like Biden's late.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.081]  Let's just kind of shuffle around and look like we're still fixing things, yeah.
[00:24:16.541 --> 00:24:18.462]  Exactly, like what the hell are we going to do?
[00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:19.182]  Get out there, damn it!
[00:24:19.222 --> 00:24:20.482]  Make it look like nothing's going on here!
[00:24:20.802 --> 00:24:21.723]  Come on, shuffle around.
[00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:22.783]  Fix the flag.
[00:24:22.883 --> 00:24:24.023]  Touch the microphone or something.
[00:24:24.244 --> 00:24:24.864]  Do a mic test.
[00:24:25.124 --> 00:24:26.884]  Big boy expects you to speak soon.
[00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:32.966]  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they're doing a test with 20 minutes late.
[00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:34.327]  They all act official and smart.
[00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:37.748]  And how much do you want to bet each one of them is farting when they get up there?
[00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:39.709]  Or that they would crop dust?
[00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:41.150]  Is that what you do in the studio?
[00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.590]  No, no, no.
[00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.013]  But actually, they probably owe it to Joe Biden after everything he's done to them.
[00:24:46.033 --> 00:24:50.056]  I don't normally smoke, but just to clear this room out.
[00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:51.477]  I wasn't prepared for this.
[00:24:51.938 --> 00:24:53.259]  I've never smoked a cigarette.
[00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:54.880]  Where'd you get that?
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.561]  This is going to be like a gas explosion.
[00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:57.401]  Are you ready to die?
[00:24:58.442 --> 00:24:58.903]  Boom!
[00:24:59.243 --> 00:25:00.063]  We're all dead.
[00:25:02.225 --> 00:25:02.925]  Damn it, Joe.
[00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:04.967]  What have you done to us?
[00:25:06.442 --> 00:25:07.723]  What have you done?
[00:25:07.743 --> 00:25:09.604]  By the way, folks, I haven't smoked in decades.
[00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:12.767]  And I picked it up only here and there.
[00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:13.487]  It's a bad thing.
[00:25:13.507 --> 00:25:14.168]  Kids don't do this at home.
[00:25:14.188 --> 00:25:14.728]  This is fake.
[00:25:14.748 --> 00:25:16.790]  This is all a deep, deep, deep fake.
[00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.231]  Deep, deep, cheap fake.
[00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:23.395]  You know, I was, uh, they had a negative story about Zinn nicotine products today.
[00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:25.156]  Oh my God, nicotine's so good for you, minus the smoke.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.781]  I've never had a zen, I know that there's some members of the crew, I was gonna, then Chuck Schumer said it was bad.
[00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:39.303]  No, no, I tried to, listen, I hadn't smoked in decades, and then I tried to stop, because during the sitting hip thralls I started smoking, and I tried the zen things, they're great, they're, all that stuff's too strong.
[00:25:39.703 --> 00:25:48.205]  Because I used to chew tobacco when I played baseball in like, you know, high school, because everybody did it, and so I'd choose like Levi Garrett and Redman, and wouldn't get sick.
[00:25:48.365 --> 00:25:49.725]  I get sick on those things, man.
[00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:50.785]  The Zins?
[00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:53.147]  Yeah, they're just so strong, I'm putting them down.
[00:25:53.628 --> 00:25:59.332]  But I mean, I could shove a giant gob of Redman in my mouth and just be in heaven for an hour.
[00:25:59.392 --> 00:25:59.852]  Long cut?
[00:26:00.353 --> 00:26:00.713]  All of it.
[00:26:01.694 --> 00:26:05.777]  Okay, they're still testing, as if they gotta have, all of them have to stand up and check.
[00:26:06.037 --> 00:26:06.737]  Get up there!
[00:26:07.078 --> 00:26:08.078]  Definitely buying time.
[00:26:08.098 --> 00:26:09.460]  Look at them shuffling around still.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.202]  Here, here, let's hear what music they've got going now.
[00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:12.902]  Here we go.
[00:26:15.924 --> 00:26:17.826]  No, Copenhagen, skull long cut.
[00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:20.323]  Let me tell you something.
[00:26:20.343 --> 00:26:21.285]  My grandmothers didn't do it.
[00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:24.113]  But my great-grandmothers were Texas Old School.
[00:26:24.134 --> 00:26:27.303]  They did the powdered stuff in the little glass bottles.
[00:26:28.268 --> 00:26:29.349]  Because ladies didn't smoke.
[00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:35.314]  But behind closed doors, they stuck the powdered snuff in between their teeth.
[00:26:35.755 --> 00:26:36.836]  Some women love zin.
[00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:38.657]  I guess because it's the same thing.
[00:26:38.677 --> 00:26:39.618]  They don't want to smoke.
[00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:40.259]  Yeah.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.261]  But they like the nicotine.
[00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:43.842]  Nicotine by itself is very good.
[00:26:43.882 --> 00:26:45.423]  It's the tar and the smoke that's bad for you.
[00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:46.364]  All the studies show.
[00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:47.966]  Let me tell you something, Tucker Carlson, you people don't know this.
[00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:49.267]  It's not even a secret.
[00:26:49.287 --> 00:26:51.469]  If you look carefully, he has it in his mouth at all times.
[00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:53.230]  Only at dinner will he pull it out.
[00:26:54.111 --> 00:26:55.832]  And then he puts it right back in.
[00:26:55.912 --> 00:26:57.912]  So he's on that stuff all the time.
[00:26:57.932 --> 00:27:01.674]  So it's just like saying the guy, the hair club guy, is actually not just the president, he's a member.
[00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:05.275]  With Tucker and his... I'm not putting Zen down.
[00:27:05.315 --> 00:27:06.215]  They're all super strong.
[00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:08.976]  I mean, it's just, you know, I even try the weak Zen.
[00:27:09.636 --> 00:27:10.637]  And it's just like, boom.
[00:27:10.717 --> 00:27:11.257]  I'm like, you know.
[00:27:11.637 --> 00:27:13.758]  The only thing I like now is caffeine.
[00:27:13.778 --> 00:27:14.898]  It's like the only stimulant.
[00:27:15.198 --> 00:27:15.598]  There's caffeine.
[00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:16.659]  Oh, and you don't even drink anymore.
[00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:17.239]  Look at this guy.
[00:27:17.259 --> 00:27:17.399]  Look.
[00:27:18.607 --> 00:27:21.350]  As if, look, okay, they're definitely stalling for time now.
[00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.551]  Yeah, 100% a stall job at this point.
[00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:23.511]  Stalling for time.
[00:27:23.531 --> 00:27:25.253]  Look at this guy on the phone.
[00:27:27.795 --> 00:27:28.536]  Oh my gosh.
[00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.598]  Now they're bringing out new flags.
[00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:33.160]  Okay, they are in full panic mode.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.881]  Wow.
[00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:41.788]  By the way, I was told this by Secret Service and New York high-level police multiple times, I'm talking people in charge, that when Biden gets mad, he craps his pants.
[00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:43.749]  Folks, look, I don't make stuff up.
[00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.411]  When I'm joking around, I'm joking around.
[00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:47.635]  Smelled like potpourri in here earlier.
[00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:48.735]  I was joking about rum.
[00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:49.916]  Do you think he pooped his pants?
[00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:51.517]  Why are they mad?
[00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:52.698]  Because they made him say Putin?
[00:27:52.718 --> 00:27:55.439]  They gave him too much methamphetamine and he's like flopping around.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.681]  Look at this.
[00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:01.623]  And look, they're moving more American flags around.
[00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:03.604]  They haven't known about this press conference.
[00:28:03.644 --> 00:28:04.365]  It's not like they've had time.
[00:28:04.385 --> 00:28:06.146]  And who knows if Osama Bin Laden's son is going to be there.
[00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:14.467]  Oh, man.
[00:28:15.368 --> 00:28:17.770]  Well, the Biden press conference so far has been great.
[00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:20.292]  Yeah, we're now 23 minutes into this.
[00:28:20.653 --> 00:28:22.314]  This has been really exciting from the big boy.
[00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:24.376]  And I could be floating around in my pool right now.
[00:28:25.598 --> 00:28:26.559]  Yeah, give us a smile.
[00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:27.499]  Come on.
[00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.001]  Okay.
[00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:30.102]  All right.
[00:28:30.122 --> 00:28:32.124]  Get that, get that, here, move that flag.
[00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:32.905]  Let's go back to a month ago.
[00:28:32.925 --> 00:28:34.366]  Let's go back to the bikini contest.
[00:28:35.928 --> 00:28:37.049]  Move that flag a little more.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.201]  Man, how late?
[00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:43.022]  This is bad.
[00:28:43.262 --> 00:28:48.125]  More than... More than 20 minutes late after an hour delay already.
[00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:51.227]  And they're shuffling things around to buy time now.
[00:28:52.748 --> 00:28:54.509]  Because they didn't know they were going to have a press conference.
[00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:55.690]  I'm just scared of Rob Deere right now.
[00:28:57.151 --> 00:28:58.652]  He's on the other side of the building now.
[00:28:59.252 --> 00:29:00.113]  Oh, look, they cut away!
[00:29:01.014 --> 00:29:02.695]  And now they got the NATO thing up there!
[00:29:03.715 --> 00:29:04.636]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:06.037 --> 00:29:08.138]  Now they have the NATO graphic up.
[00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.040]  Well, we may be here for a couple hours.
[00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:12.085]  Hell, maybe he just died.
[00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.427]  They might just cancel this.
[00:29:13.487 --> 00:29:14.067]  It just might be.
[00:29:14.408 --> 00:29:16.270]  So, who predicted they would cancel it earlier?
[00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.572]  Somebody came in here and said they're just gonna cancel it.
[00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:19.693]  I think it was Rob Dew.
[00:29:21.155 --> 00:29:21.736]  He should've.
[00:29:22.602 --> 00:29:23.143]  There you go Alex.
[00:29:23.163 --> 00:29:24.023]  Let's go full screen on this.
[00:29:24.044 --> 00:29:25.225]  You got what you requested now.
[00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:26.086]  Oh my God.
[00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.127]  This is what they're doing.
[00:29:27.207 --> 00:29:28.188]  This is how we're going to do it.
[00:29:28.228 --> 00:29:29.209]  We're buying time now.
[00:29:29.229 --> 00:29:32.873]  The Lord is a good person and creates these lovely ladies.
[00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:34.074]  We're buying time now.
[00:29:34.454 --> 00:29:35.315]  By the way, I'm a Christian.
[00:29:35.335 --> 00:29:35.776]  I love God.
[00:29:35.796 --> 00:29:37.277]  But every time we do this kind of stuff, people get mad.
[00:29:37.297 --> 00:29:38.018]  They say, what are you doing?
[00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:39.360]  I didn't say I was a saint.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.021]  Put her back up, God Almighty.
[00:29:42.103 --> 00:29:43.884]  Jesus, I love you, Lord.
[00:29:45.294 --> 00:29:47.296]  So, you gotta thank God for all the things he's created.
[00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.117]  And, you know, God gave us all this.
[00:29:49.157 --> 00:29:49.718]  Not the devil.
[00:29:49.758 --> 00:29:52.320]  God gave us life, our families, all the good things.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.060]  Wow, look at her.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.282]  Is this the same show that you guys had on earlier?
[00:29:55.742 --> 00:29:56.423]  Is this a new one?
[00:29:56.563 --> 00:29:58.545]  I don't know, but I like this better than the last one.
[00:29:58.585 --> 00:29:58.945]  Jesus.
[00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:00.686]  Thank you, Lord.
[00:30:02.308 --> 00:30:03.208]  Lord Gibbeth, doesn't he?
[00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:06.150]  I mean, God is... Is there a God, folks?
[00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:06.991]  Yes, there's a God.
[00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:08.993]  God came up with that.
[00:30:11.715 --> 00:30:14.057]  All very good in matrimony.
[00:30:15.728 --> 00:30:16.728]  Let's go to the audio of this.
[00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:17.809]  This is spectacular.
[00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.590]  Oh yeah.
[00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:26.372]  The other stations waiting for the big boy press conference are not bringing you this.
[00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:28.133]  That's true.
[00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.714]  And, by the way, we're thinking about you, the audience.
[00:30:31.775 --> 00:30:32.015]  You know.
[00:30:32.835 --> 00:30:36.197]  That's how considerate we are.
[00:30:36.237 --> 00:30:36.937]  They cut away.
[00:30:36.977 --> 00:30:38.718]  They don't even have the shot of the studio up now.
[00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:41.739]  So, as we wait,
[00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.670]  Don't make us look at Owen and me.
[00:30:44.731 --> 00:30:45.571]  Let's go back full screen.
[00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:50.913]  It's a nice, uh, what do you call this music?
[00:30:51.613 --> 00:30:52.954]  Kind of house, relaxed.
[00:30:53.094 --> 00:30:53.574]  Like house?
[00:30:53.634 --> 00:30:54.355]  House elevator.
[00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:55.815]  Yeah, I was gonna say house elevator.
[00:30:55.935 --> 00:30:56.435]  I like it.
[00:30:57.176 --> 00:30:58.256]  Deep, this is deep house.
[00:30:58.316 --> 00:30:59.257]  Deep house, deep.
[00:31:00.737 --> 00:31:02.018]  Definitely would go deep on all this.
[00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.739]  Just, oh my goodness gracious.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.001]  Things are looking good today.
[00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.512]  Old-fashioned artillery.
[00:31:14.532 --> 00:31:15.654]  I like this athletic look, too.
[00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:15.754]  Man.
[00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:19.398]  This is an empowered woman.
[00:31:39.929 --> 00:31:41.830]  Will Michelle Obama come running home?
[00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.090]  Someday.
[00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.251]  Like the Kool-Aid guy crushing, or like the slitsmalt liquor?
[00:31:45.891 --> 00:31:48.051]  Guys, show the slitsmalt liquor bowl bust to the wall.
[00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:52.513]  Wow, I can't even see.
[00:31:52.573 --> 00:31:53.073]  Wow, look at her.
[00:31:53.113 --> 00:31:54.293]  I can't even see the bikini straps.
[00:31:55.754 --> 00:31:56.254]  Are there any?
[00:31:58.395 --> 00:31:58.915]  There's the best part.
[00:31:58.935 --> 00:31:59.515]  Oh yeah, there is.
[00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:00.455]  There is little.
[00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:02.576]  Oh my goodness.
[00:32:05.137 --> 00:32:07.317]  I think, I think this is it for Joe Biden.
[00:32:07.757 --> 00:32:08.157]  This is it.
[00:32:08.198 --> 00:32:09.498]  He can't even show up on time.
[00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:14.513]  I'd be getting this show in my backyard right now, so.
[00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:17.977]  You're being denied this show, so you're trying to replace it?
[00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:19.159]  Is that what's going on here?
[00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:21.141]  Yeah, well, we just pulled up some bikinis to go out to my wife.
[00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:23.704]  You know, I posted on my wife's ex-picture in a bikini.
[00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:25.786]  Everybody's like, you're disrespecting your husband.
[00:32:26.087 --> 00:32:26.908]  God made this.
[00:32:26.968 --> 00:32:28.750]  We should celebrate this in matrimony.
[00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:35.854]  That's actually what the whole trans culture, the liberal progressive trans culture is about.
[00:32:36.034 --> 00:32:40.858]  Less like Gillette ads, remember, where the guy tries to talk to a girl on the street, he's bad and gets stopped?
[00:32:41.158 --> 00:32:47.523]  No, guys talking to girls, and that's normal, folks, but convicted pedophiles trying to have access to your kids, that's okay?
[00:32:48.223 --> 00:32:49.704]  Like, a steak is really good.
[00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:50.885]  A filet mignon is really good.
[00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:55.109]  So they want to fake it and have a bug paste steak and say, no, you eat this now.
[00:32:55.129 --> 00:32:59.293]  It's like, hey, a beautiful woman is like universally attractive.
[00:32:59.713 --> 00:33:04.777]  So they say, oh no, we're going to give you a man that's pretending to be a woman now.
[00:33:05.398 --> 00:33:06.419]  I like that blue on her.
[00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:07.580]  I don't know this ad.
[00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.302]  What happens here?
[00:33:10.682 --> 00:33:12.624]  It's a Slipmalt liquor ad.
[00:33:12.644 --> 00:33:15.847]  I was saying you should have Michelle Obama bust to the wall like the bull.
[00:33:16.792 --> 00:33:18.613]  She's about to bust through the wall in this election.
[00:33:20.393 --> 00:33:20.833]  Here we go.
[00:33:24.194 --> 00:33:25.254]  Classic Americana.
[00:33:25.534 --> 00:33:26.175]  Yeah, classic.
[00:33:26.455 --> 00:33:26.695]  Boom.
[00:33:26.835 --> 00:33:27.255]  There we go.
[00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:27.715]  Yep.
[00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.656]  Shell Obama, man.
[00:33:30.956 --> 00:33:31.476]  A bull.
[00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:32.416]  No one does it.
[00:33:34.497 --> 00:33:35.017]  That's good.
[00:33:35.157 --> 00:33:36.517]  Now we need to see a Kool-Aid ad.
[00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:42.379]  They just keep coming.
[00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:43.259]  The hits just keep coming.
[00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:45.220]  I'm not against a voluptuous woman.
[00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:48.687]  I'm just saying, the more athletic ones kind of are my type.
[00:33:50.649 --> 00:33:51.249]  I'm putting her down.
[00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.151]  She's a very beautiful young lady.
[00:33:56.795 --> 00:34:00.098]  He's trying to win your vote over here.
[00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.699]  Actually, I'm voting for Michelle Obama.
[00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:02.540]  There he is.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.021]  Pete Rose.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:07.765]  Wow, these are throwbacks.
[00:34:08.425 --> 00:34:09.366]  Jim Jones pops through.
[00:34:09.386 --> 00:34:12.089]  He goes, only way the Kool-Aid works is if you all drink it.
[00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.472]  Well, as Joe Biden is stalling and having his butt wiped, we're going back in time.
[00:34:22.552 --> 00:34:24.333]  They are now 30 minutes late.
[00:34:25.973 --> 00:34:27.434]  This is actually, this is bad.
[00:34:28.334 --> 00:34:29.134]  This is really bad.
[00:34:29.154 --> 00:34:31.515]  I noticed they had to all run around like they had a technical problem.
[00:34:31.535 --> 00:34:32.536]  They go, that's not working.
[00:34:33.176 --> 00:34:34.096]  You called it, Owen.
[00:34:34.696 --> 00:34:38.098]  And so now... Hmm.
[00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:41.279]  Okay.
[00:34:44.577 --> 00:34:48.800]  Again, nowhere do you get live big boy press conference coverage like this.
[00:34:49.961 --> 00:34:50.861]  Now, nothing against her.
[00:34:50.921 --> 00:34:52.282]  She's beautiful, but she's too skinny.
[00:34:55.424 --> 00:34:57.485]  I think that's, uh, bigoted of you, Alex.
[00:34:57.886 --> 00:34:59.487]  Well, I'm allowed to have my preferences.
[00:34:59.747 --> 00:35:00.207]  No, you're not.
[00:35:01.348 --> 00:35:02.689]  Well, uh... That's very bigoted.
[00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.030]  How dare you?
[00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:09.593]  Well... Let's back this up to the beginning again.
[00:35:09.613 --> 00:35:10.254]  Let's start over.
[00:35:10.994 --> 00:35:12.955]  Let's just go through... Now, hold on.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.536]  You don't wanna...
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.842]  Well, there's more coming.
[00:35:17.565 --> 00:35:19.067]  We don't want to give him a repeat here.
[00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:22.053]  We're trying to kill time.
[00:35:23.756 --> 00:35:25.379]  We may be waiting for the rest of our lives here.
[00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:26.882]  Could be hours at this rate.
[00:35:28.123 --> 00:35:30.445]  I can't believe they have the NATO graphic up, too.
[00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:40.953]  This is such... Alright, we're going to continue with the, you know, the nice display that we have going on here to kill time.
[00:35:41.534 --> 00:35:50.101]  But to get serious for a second, folks, these are the same people that told you Joe Biden was the most fit, greatest president of all time, most votes of all time.
[00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.022]  Of course, he's the one that's going to run and beat Trump.
[00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:56.546]  They forced Joe Biden into the picture and now he can't even show up at a press conference.
[00:35:57.918 --> 00:36:02.382]  So we have to show you women in bikinis because there's no president.
[00:36:02.402 --> 00:36:05.204]  Well, the left, like you said, is trying to ban this like this isn't wholesome.
[00:36:05.724 --> 00:36:08.547]  We're adults looking at a beautiful human body, beautiful women.
[00:36:09.027 --> 00:36:12.250]  Even the ladies, I'm sure, who aren't even into women, they appreciate a beautiful body.
[00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.311]  They worked hard for that.
[00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:23.819]  So for our men and women viewers, we are not going to subject you to just looking at Owen and Smell-O-Vision with Rob Dew and my meatball ass.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.281]  I'm going to ask you, Rob, which one do you like the best?
[00:36:27.996 --> 00:36:28.957]  I like them all, actually.
[00:36:29.577 --> 00:36:30.357]  Just some good girls.
[00:36:30.517 --> 00:36:31.478]  You don't think you could choose?
[00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:35.179]  I like some of those first really athletic ones that still got some booty.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.260]  I like some of the first ones.
[00:36:38.141 --> 00:36:43.123]  I think that your preferential to blondes is what it seems to be.
[00:36:43.143 --> 00:36:44.423]  I like vanilla and chocolate ice cream.
[00:36:46.484 --> 00:36:47.245]  Just like Joe Biden.
[00:36:47.265 --> 00:36:48.165]  He likes the swirl.
[00:36:48.245 --> 00:36:50.506]  Actually, you've never seen him eat a chocolate ice cream.
[00:36:50.526 --> 00:36:50.946]  It's racist.
[00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:51.647]  Is that true?
[00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:52.327]  I don't know.
[00:36:52.347 --> 00:36:53.548]  That girl in orange looks pretty good.
[00:36:53.568 --> 00:36:55.628]  Oh, the black girl looks good.
[00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:56.189]  I mean, they're all...
[00:36:57.312 --> 00:36:57.912]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:36:57.972 --> 00:36:59.553]  It's really a tough situation.
[00:37:00.674 --> 00:37:05.037]  That one right there, uh, next to the guy, uh, the one in, uh, the blonde, she's nice.
[00:37:06.197 --> 00:37:06.598]  And that's all.
[00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:07.318]  Very nice, girls.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.021]  Uh, I think we should actually put on the info war.
[00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:12.701]  Is that chocolate?
[00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:13.302]  Oh my God!
[00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:14.182]  I've been disproven.
[00:37:14.202 --> 00:37:14.783]  He's not racist.
[00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:15.583]  Well, we don't know.
[00:37:15.643 --> 00:37:16.024]  Hold on.
[00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:18.065]  Oh, he really enjoyed that.
[00:37:18.105 --> 00:37:18.505]  Look at that.
[00:37:18.525 --> 00:37:20.486]  He ate my ice cream!
[00:37:21.347 --> 00:37:22.808]  Okay, so let's just loop this.
[00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:24.879]  Uh, here he is.
[00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.060]  Did you know that Biden met with President Putin today?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.780]  Yeah, it's true.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.100]  Here it is.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:36.343]  And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination.
[00:37:36.743 --> 00:37:38.183]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
[00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:40.524]  President Putin.
[00:37:41.444 --> 00:37:42.684]  You can beat President Putin.
[00:37:43.184 --> 00:37:43.985]  President Zelensky.
[00:37:45.025 --> 00:37:47.826]  I'm so focused on beating Putin, we gotta worry about it.
[00:37:48.186 --> 00:37:48.466]  Anyway.
[00:37:49.246 --> 00:37:50.448]  Mr. President, I'm better.
[00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:51.930]  You are a hell of a better.
[00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:54.634]  You know, good thing we went to this, because look at this.
[00:37:54.654 --> 00:37:55.415]  This is just terrible.
[00:37:55.455 --> 00:37:56.276]  Get this off the screen.
[00:37:56.797 --> 00:37:58.499]  Oh my god, we're in After Hours now.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.242]  Yeah, this is a little too racy.
[00:38:00.903 --> 00:38:01.904]  Just shut it off.
[00:38:01.924 --> 00:38:04.248]  This is just body tape that they're wearing.
[00:38:05.273 --> 00:38:06.173]  Yeah, this is terrible.
[00:38:06.213 --> 00:38:07.654]  Get it off the screen right now.
[00:38:08.274 --> 00:38:09.535]  No, thank God it's not on screen.
[00:38:09.615 --> 00:38:09.915]  Okay.
[00:38:10.736 --> 00:38:10.936]  Good.
[00:38:11.216 --> 00:38:12.396]  Oh, they're only showing it to us.
[00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:13.737]  Absolute torture.
[00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:14.778]  They do that to me all the time.
[00:38:14.798 --> 00:38:23.602]  They put, they flash something like some Michelle Obama meme where she's got like a big hog and I'm just sitting here trying to do a show and there's Michelle Obama with a hog.
[00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:26.599]  Like, what the hell is going on?
[00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:28.000]  I'm in the control room sometimes.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.900]  I see you going like, why do they do that to me in there?
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.281]  Why do they have a preview screen of the big TV right there?
[00:38:34.301 --> 00:38:35.822]  It's like a separate screen all together.
[00:38:35.842 --> 00:38:37.682]  They gaslight me all the time with this thing.
[00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.982]  They'll put up all kinds of crazy stuff over here.
[00:38:40.022 --> 00:38:40.983]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:38:41.103 --> 00:38:42.683]  Just on record so we're not hiding something.
[00:38:42.703 --> 00:38:43.763]  Show everybody what you were just seeing.
[00:38:44.444 --> 00:38:45.064]  On the main screen.
[00:38:45.084 --> 00:38:45.264]  Oh yeah.
[00:38:45.284 --> 00:38:46.544]  Well, it was something before that.
[00:38:46.664 --> 00:38:49.145]  Should we go into the portal with Katy Perry?
[00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:51.245]  You know about that?
[00:38:52.325 --> 00:38:52.886]  I don't know.
[00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:54.586]  Katy Perry launched a portal today.
[00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:56.826]  Yeah, I don't like Katy Perry.
[00:38:56.846 --> 00:38:57.447]  She's too skinny.
[00:38:57.467 --> 00:39:01.390]  But this is, uh... You know there's God who created this.
[00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.272]  This is the Lord's work right here, like a sunset.
[00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:06.054]  That super white skin with that black hair.
[00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:08.697]  That is... That is nice.
[00:39:08.757 --> 00:39:09.778]  Whoa, super white?
[00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:11.499]  And white on black.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.420]  That's a nice look, too.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.643]  Alright, I'm being bad.
[00:39:15.683 --> 00:39:16.524]  I apologize, Lord.
[00:39:16.544 --> 00:39:16.985]  I repent.
[00:39:17.165 --> 00:39:17.825]  You made me this way.
[00:39:18.646 --> 00:39:19.447]  Go back to the beginning.
[00:39:20.748 --> 00:39:23.429]  Dammit, we're just gonna review swimsuit shows now.
[00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.592]  We came to do a presidential press conference coverage, but he didn't show up.
[00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.553]  He is now 33 minutes late.
[00:39:32.174 --> 00:39:32.614]  No show.
[00:39:33.175 --> 00:39:34.375]  They even cut the feed!
[00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:36.857]  And they put up some weird... And you called it!
[00:39:37.297 --> 00:39:39.718]  They had to come out and... Turn this off, please.
[00:39:40.258 --> 00:39:44.661]  They had to... They had to... They had to... You said it.
[00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:46.902]  Bring them out and act like equipment was broken.
[00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.931]  And it was like, okay, well we've done it.
[00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:52.331]  Rob Dews back in the room going, uh-oh.
[00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.471]  Run another bombing run.
[00:39:55.992 --> 00:39:56.552]  He's on the parasite.
[00:39:56.572 --> 00:39:57.913]  No, my parasite cleanse is over.
[00:39:58.073 --> 00:39:58.633]  So he did it.
[00:39:58.753 --> 00:40:00.273]  That was a long time ago.
[00:40:00.293 --> 00:40:03.814]  I heard from the crew.
[00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.615]  They said, oh, he blamed you.
[00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:06.255]  That's not nice.
[00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:07.175]  Wow.
[00:40:07.755 --> 00:40:08.575]  This is unbelievable.
[00:40:08.595 --> 00:40:09.216]  This is what you get.
[00:40:09.236 --> 00:40:10.236]  Oh my gosh.
[00:40:12.917 --> 00:40:13.717]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:18.223]  It's a terrible job, but somebody's got to do it.
[00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.725]  It's like in Dumb and Dumber, they go, we need oil boys.
[00:40:20.745 --> 00:40:30.392]  And he goes, there's a town about 10 miles... You know, they ought to do Dumb and Dumber 3 and just have Joe Biden... With Kamala Harris, they could be the... Yeah.
[00:40:30.772 --> 00:40:33.134]  No acting needed, just put... Yeah, just have him talk.
[00:40:33.274 --> 00:40:34.014]  Yeah, just be normal.
[00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.557]  Although he's fixing the tape right now.
[00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:38.678]  How nice of him.
[00:40:38.778 --> 00:40:39.078]  Wow.
[00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:41.500]  Is that a TSA agent?
[00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:43.514]  Yeah, it is a TSA.
[00:40:43.595 --> 00:40:44.535]  He's checking for bombs?
[00:40:45.716 --> 00:40:46.756]  Are there any bombs in there?
[00:40:48.097 --> 00:40:50.318]  Hillary Clinton has a snook in her sniz.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.600]  My goodness.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.481]  Well, they do it to our kids with the TSA.
[00:40:55.501 --> 00:40:56.222]  It must be alright.
[00:40:57.142 --> 00:40:57.643]  There you go.
[00:40:57.843 --> 00:40:59.043]  These are TSA agents.
[00:40:59.464 --> 00:41:02.746]  They've done such a great job feeling up Americans.
[00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:03.366]  That's right.
[00:41:03.866 --> 00:41:04.967]  That guy should work for the TSA.
[00:41:05.027 --> 00:41:06.748]  Actually, that's your next job after the TSA?
[00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:10.987]  You know, we make jokes about it, but this is actually going on.
[00:41:12.848 --> 00:41:14.889]  We are now 35 minutes late.
[00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:18.290]  Joe Biden a no-show to his own press conference.
[00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.551]  I feel like that time we were waiting for WikiLeaks to do the press conference, they didn't show up.
[00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:23.172]  I was up here at 3 a.m.
[00:41:23.792 --> 00:41:25.353]  You got a little out of hand that night, too.
[00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:26.657]  I did?
[00:41:27.157 --> 00:41:29.759]  Well, you made some statements.
[00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:31.840]  People didn't understand what you were saying, though.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.382]  They didn't understand what you were saying when you said that Julian Assange was Hillary Clinton's butt plug.
[00:41:37.122 --> 00:41:41.044]  What you meant was that he was stopping the information from being released.
[00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:41.545]  That's what I meant.
[00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:41.725]  Yeah.
[00:41:41.805 --> 00:41:44.826]  Like, I got it, but people thought it was just some insult.
[00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:50.689]  It was like, no, we want him to release... That the same night I said I'm not going to... The golf ball through the garden hose?
[00:41:50.889 --> 00:41:52.070]  No, I think that was a different night.
[00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.672]  That was the night after, I think, the first strike on Syria.
[00:41:56.724 --> 00:41:57.545]  I think it was that night.
[00:41:58.746 --> 00:42:00.808]  Uh, okay, so are we back live now, guys?
[00:42:00.828 --> 00:42:01.628]  Is this back live?
[00:42:04.931 --> 00:42:08.274]  Look at, oh my gosh, Alex, look at how tiny amount of press there are in there.
[00:42:08.414 --> 00:42:10.736]  That's because they only allow certain people with vetted questions in.
[00:42:10.756 --> 00:42:11.477]  You know it's all rigged.
[00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:12.038]  Look at that.
[00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:12.878]  That's unbelievable.
[00:42:12.918 --> 00:42:16.862]  Hey, hey, let's get Rob Agueros, Rob Doo, also known as the Master Blaster.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.464]  Oh boy, so the room isn't even half filled.
[00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:23.766]  Well that's because it's controlled, Owen, you know that.
[00:42:24.107 --> 00:42:26.549]  Hey guys, can we talk about this and get really serious here?
[00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:30.394]  I want some of the crew to be able to step up to the microphone.
[00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.455]  Is Chase Geiser still here?
[00:42:31.475 --> 00:42:33.737]  I thought we should be taking calls right now.
[00:42:33.777 --> 00:42:39.564]  I'm sorry to the listeners, everybody watching us on X right now, but it's not our fault that Biden has had some type of episode probably.
[00:42:40.575 --> 00:42:44.900]  Yeah, this is, uh, we're going on 40 minutes late to his own press conference.
[00:42:45.121 --> 00:42:52.810]  So, so really, they already had things, this thing, this was supposed to start at, uh, the original time was 4.30 central.
[00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:56.174]  So we're, so technically he's over an hour and a half late.
[00:42:56.915 --> 00:42:58.017]  Media still showing up.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.541]  Yes, they keep moving the Gold Post back.
[00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:02.562]  Let me just say this.
[00:43:02.642 --> 00:43:04.343]  This is paradoxical for viewers and listeners.
[00:43:05.344 --> 00:43:11.949]  Five weeks ago, a rogue government agency, the Justice Department controls the U.S.
[00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:14.211]  trustee, ordered this place shut outside of judge's order.
[00:43:14.671 --> 00:43:15.992]  The judge shut it down, blocked it.
[00:43:16.092 --> 00:43:16.753]  I told everybody that.
[00:43:16.773 --> 00:43:17.313]  They didn't believe it.
[00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:19.275]  Later, it hit the news, the judge refused to shut us down.
[00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:25.754]  But then now all the viewers and listeners think we're about to be shut down, so literally no one's buying products at infowarestore.com.
[00:43:25.794 --> 00:43:28.216]  We've got like three months of runway, and we'll probably continue on the air.
[00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.657]  Not guaranteed, but I'd say 60% chance now.
[00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:34.019]  But if you don't order products at infowarestore.com, we will shut down.
[00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:38.581]  And if you don't support our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, we will.
[00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:48.487]  And these are great products, colloidal silver, all the nano silver products, nitric boost, X2, X3, all at infowarestore.com and drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:52.572]  We're fighting hard here, but that's a new paradoxical view.
[00:43:52.612 --> 00:43:53.892]  Everybody believed me because it was true.
[00:43:54.212 --> 00:44:01.214]  Hey, they're trying to shut us down right now, and then it hit the news it was true, and then we barely survived, and then people are like, well, you're being shut down.
[00:44:01.234 --> 00:44:02.514]  I'm like, no, we survived.
[00:44:02.554 --> 00:44:05.495]  It's like watching Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier.
[00:44:05.515 --> 00:44:08.316]  It looks like Muhammad Ali's losing at first, then he wins the 11th or 12th round.
[00:44:09.256 --> 00:44:10.396]  And I'm not saying we won the fight.
[00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:13.517]  We're like in the 10th round with Joe Frazier, and we're not feeling too happy here.
[00:44:13.957 --> 00:44:16.898]  But we're fighting back, and it's like, well, why does this fight keep going?
[00:44:17.158 --> 00:44:19.158]  Because it's a fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:19.578 --> 00:44:21.779]  So now it's people believing we got beat.
[00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:25.299]  When we didn't get beat, we barely crawled out of it and survived.
[00:44:25.539 --> 00:44:29.740]  But now we need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com and, of course, mfulworthstore.com.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.560]  Rob, do you want to comment?
[00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:33.361]  Let's fade his microphone up.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.662]  It is a psyop that they're trying to do that.
[00:44:36.682 --> 00:44:39.746]  They keep throwing this out here that we're going down, we're going down, we're going down.
[00:44:40.126 --> 00:44:46.233]  So then that spreads out because there's, I found a tweet the other day of some other talk show host going, yep, they've been shut down.
[00:44:46.273 --> 00:44:46.854]  Good riddance.
[00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:48.356]  And we're still here on the air.
[00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:49.978]  A month later, it was a month old.
[00:44:50.238 --> 00:44:51.359]  You follow the news.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.341]  They came and tried to shut it down.
[00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:54.021]  I said no.
[00:44:54.081 --> 00:44:54.901]  Threatened to call the police.
[00:44:54.941 --> 00:44:55.781]  They had to back off.
[00:44:56.062 --> 00:44:57.442]  The judge fired the U.S.
[00:44:57.462 --> 00:44:58.022]  trustee.
[00:44:58.402 --> 00:44:59.103]  Kicked them all out.
[00:44:59.203 --> 00:44:59.883]  Huge scandal.
[00:44:59.983 --> 00:45:01.163]  No news coverage of it now.
[00:45:01.424 --> 00:45:03.464]  But it was admitted that the judge didn't shut us down.
[00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:07.426]  And now the judge is giving us months and months and months to stabilize and get a buyer.
[00:45:08.286 --> 00:45:09.548]  Which then we continue on.
[00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:11.350]  I'm just not the owner and that's what we're going for.
[00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:12.731]  They're trying to block that behind the scenes.
[00:45:13.212 --> 00:45:16.796]  But if we don't have funds to operate for a few months, while that happens, we get shut down.
[00:45:16.816 --> 00:45:19.899]  But Rob, first people thought I made it up.
[00:45:19.939 --> 00:45:21.321]  They came and tried to lock the place down.
[00:45:21.581 --> 00:45:22.142]  You were here.
[00:45:22.522 --> 00:45:23.083]  Owen, you were here.
[00:45:23.183 --> 00:45:23.784]  Did I make this up?
[00:45:24.224 --> 00:45:25.506]  No, you didn't make it up at all.
[00:45:26.988 --> 00:45:30.473]  It got so bad, you know, you started pulling your books off the shelves.
[00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.276]  You started cleaning out your office of your stuff.
[00:45:33.316 --> 00:45:35.059]  People started bringing their own stuff home.
[00:45:35.379 --> 00:45:38.904]  One of the graphic designers here, Dan, made some amazing art that was all over the walls.
[00:45:39.364 --> 00:45:41.227]  He started pulling that down because everybody...
[00:45:41.988 --> 00:45:43.369]  We were sleeping up here for a week.
[00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.531]  At least two nights, maybe even more.
[00:45:45.591 --> 00:45:47.533]  I know two nights for a fact you were sleeping up here.
[00:45:47.553 --> 00:45:49.395]  Two nights and a couple more nights, yeah.
[00:45:49.415 --> 00:45:50.816]  They actually did that to us twice.
[00:45:51.277 --> 00:45:58.323]  Because when they banned all your social media accounts and they banned all of InfoWars accounts and our YouTube channel, people thought that that was our shutdown.
[00:45:58.384 --> 00:46:00.305]  And they started writing stories, InfoWars shut down.
[00:46:00.345 --> 00:46:02.007]  Well, we never shut down at that point.
[00:46:02.287 --> 00:46:04.750]  But what's crazy is, I want to do this this week or next week.
[00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.936]  I want to get the whole five-week saga and show them denying it, them admitting it.
[00:46:10.016 --> 00:46:13.039]  AP Reuters, okay, he'll be shut down this week, he'll be shut down next week.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.262]  Sheriff to come close is, remember, three weeks ago?
[00:46:15.282 --> 00:46:16.183]  Yep.
[00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:18.185]  And then the federal judge blocked it and I said, see?
[00:46:19.312 --> 00:46:24.615]  Well, and remember, they also wanted to try and take your personal social media account, your personal ex-account.
[00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:25.535]  They were going to take that away.
[00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:27.096]  They filed in court to take that away.
[00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:28.217]  Notice how that died.
[00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:30.498]  It was a big news story on Reuters that they're going to take it away.
[00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:31.078]  Ha ha ha.
[00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:32.259]  But then it doesn't happen.
[00:46:32.939 --> 00:46:33.680]  And that's the thing.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:40.343]  Listeners are great, but some of them think you're either globalist-controlled or you're living out of your car.
[00:46:41.003 --> 00:46:42.124]  Freedom is popular.
[00:46:42.164 --> 00:46:44.565]  We're hard to kill because of our supporters.
[00:46:44.765 --> 00:46:46.846]  And when they tried to come and shut us down, I said, I'm calling the police.
[00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:47.507]  You don't have a court order.
[00:46:48.663 --> 00:46:50.184]  And I had to confront people.
[00:46:51.005 --> 00:46:51.365]  Okay.
[00:46:51.525 --> 00:46:58.190]  So, I mean, we went through this, this happened, but the weird thing is now people think we're shut down.
[00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.951]  So they're not supporting.
[00:46:59.011 --> 00:46:59.731]  No, we're still here.
[00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:00.812]  We're still here.
[00:47:00.892 --> 00:47:03.474]  And we got, we got more months left.
[00:47:03.494 --> 00:47:05.395]  I think we're going to be here till, till the election.
[00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.857]  I predict that we'll be here till the election.
[00:47:08.097 --> 00:47:09.198]  Well, look, it's not a secret.
[00:47:09.238 --> 00:47:11.660]  So the lawyers don't want to give us strategy, but it's not a secret.
[00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:18.630]  You can sell the operation.
[00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:21.012]  And that's what the judge said he expects.
[00:47:21.032 --> 00:47:22.492]  You don't just get rid of a profitable thing.
[00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:26.475]  So, and then the money from the sale goes to these people, but they said to the judge, we don't want money.
[00:47:27.335 --> 00:47:30.397]  So the judge has given it three months, really, of runway.
[00:47:30.417 --> 00:47:37.502]  I'm not going to get into meetings and the rest of it with the folks and everything, but it's not even a secret because the enemy knows all this, but you know.
[00:47:37.942 --> 00:47:44.706]  Notice there's no news coverage since the judge fired the Justice Department appointee and all the people, what was it, two weeks ago, three weeks ago?
[00:47:46.058 --> 00:47:47.459]  Yeah, two and a half, three weeks ago.
[00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:49.040]  Notice, zero coverage, folks.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.440]  Why's that?
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.361]  Three weeks ago, he shut down this week.
[00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:53.042]  The sheriff's coming to lock the doors.
[00:47:53.062 --> 00:47:53.562]  Remember that?
[00:47:55.203 --> 00:47:57.565]  Just type in Alex Jones to Google News and click it and read it.
[00:47:59.025 --> 00:48:06.870]  And the best part is the New York Times three weeks ago going, well, all his finances have been looked at by three federally appointed accountants and Jones never really had any money.
[00:48:08.482 --> 00:48:09.122]  I don't think so.
[00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:29.647]  My dad gave me this Rolex.
[00:48:29.667 --> 00:48:30.507]  That's one reason I wear a Rolex.
[00:48:30.868 --> 00:48:33.068]  I don't care about a nice car.
[00:48:33.468 --> 00:48:35.409]  I don't care about a big house.
[00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:36.169]  I don't care.
[00:48:36.189 --> 00:48:37.089]  I care about freedom.
[00:48:37.529 --> 00:48:43.010]  So they thought it would piss me off taking a few hundred thousand bucks out of my bank account.
[00:48:44.091 --> 00:48:45.751]  I mean, guys, remember all the headlines?
[00:48:45.851 --> 00:48:46.831]  Hundreds of millions of dollars?
[00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:48.332]  Jones is going to jail.
[00:48:48.372 --> 00:48:48.712]  He hit it.
[00:48:50.152 --> 00:48:50.672]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:48:50.752 --> 00:48:53.333]  Alex Jones in for his shutdown to plan my bankruptcy.
[00:48:53.353 --> 00:48:53.633]  Look at that.
[00:48:53.653 --> 00:48:53.913]  Look at that.
[00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:54.173]  Look at that.
[00:48:54.997 --> 00:48:57.138]  Look at that, Alex Jones before shutdown looms.
[00:48:57.439 --> 00:48:58.399]  Click, click, news though.
[00:48:58.419 --> 00:48:58.960]  That's web.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.941]  Oh, that is news, okay.
[00:49:02.422 --> 00:49:03.242]  Type in the New York Times.
[00:49:03.282 --> 00:49:05.344]  Put in newyorktimes.com behind Alex Jones.
[00:49:06.685 --> 00:49:07.725]  Yeah, just type in New York Times.
[00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.387]  Look at that.
[00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:11.148]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:49:11.388 --> 00:49:14.650]  The sub-headline, meager assets.
[00:49:15.871 --> 00:49:17.592]  Three federally appointed accountants.
[00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:22.407]  Because they would go like, oh, he made $50 million.
[00:49:22.747 --> 00:49:23.588]  That would be gross.
[00:49:23.768 --> 00:49:27.270]  When you're selling food, you make 30% or water filters 30% or supplements 50%.
[00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:33.334]  And then they would count the corporation reporting their taxes, and me personally, so they'd say, oh, that's $100 million.
[00:49:33.354 --> 00:49:34.014]  See how that works, Owen?
[00:49:34.254 --> 00:49:34.555]  Well, no.
[00:49:34.635 --> 00:49:35.695]  So it'd be gross $50 million.
[00:49:35.715 --> 00:49:36.376]  They'd go, oh, look.
[00:49:36.796 --> 00:49:40.558]  Look, his corporation made $50, and he made $50, and the company made, they'd say, $150 million.
[00:49:41.598 --> 00:49:47.522]  Well they just assume that people are too stupid to understand what gross profit or gross income is.
[00:49:48.623 --> 00:49:53.226]  Because I explain this a lot to people when I'm talking to the audience.
[00:49:53.586 --> 00:49:58.670]  You have a lot of supplement companies out there and they sell supplements to make money.
[00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.031]  That's their business.
[00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:01.212]  We sell supplements, we make money.
[00:50:01.572 --> 00:50:05.595]  We sell supplements to make money that funds our operation.
[00:50:06.215 --> 00:50:17.006]  So it's like the supplement sales aren't to bring in the profit from supplement sales, the supplement sales are bringing the profit to pay the crew, pay the bills here, and fund InfoWars.
[00:50:17.166 --> 00:50:27.316]  But let's be clear, there's nothing wrong with making a bunch of money, but I never tried to make a bunch of money because I don't want 20 bedrooms for my dog to take a dump in.
[00:50:28.096 --> 00:50:29.037]  I don't care about that.
[00:50:29.558 --> 00:50:36.245]  And so at our heyday in 2016, I was putting 10 million a year in advertising with the extra money we got to put our ads everywhere.
[00:50:36.265 --> 00:50:37.086]  That's why we dominated.
[00:50:37.687 --> 00:50:39.008]  And then they took Google Ads from us.
[00:50:39.228 --> 00:50:44.094]  Well, you know, I've been here since 2009 when it was just one little part of this complex that we're in now.
[00:50:44.494 --> 00:50:56.970]  We expanded, then we got another spot across the way and it just kept growing and growing because instead of just taking the money and doing things like buying a jet or an island or whatever, you put it back into the operation, hiring more people.
[00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:00.134]  I mean, at one point there was like 15 reporters running around here.
[00:51:00.795 --> 00:51:04.837]  And then, via seven years of lawsuits and all of it, they shut us down to this core group here.
[00:51:04.857 --> 00:51:11.980]  So that's why I'm saying, listeners, go to DRJonesNationals.com, go to InfoWarsTore.com, because now we're crushed down to nothing.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:17.382]  I mean, I had, as of yesterday, and then the media will run with this, and it's like, oh, he's a pussy, he's a loser.
[00:51:17.442 --> 00:51:19.403]  I'm actually proud of it, because it shows I don't care.
[00:51:19.423 --> 00:51:25.466]  $4,000 in my bank account yesterday, with about $20,000 in bills, and I went and said,
[00:51:26.246 --> 00:51:27.266]  Can I just have some money?
[00:51:27.346 --> 00:51:28.147]  My dad doesn't have a ton of money.
[00:51:28.167 --> 00:51:29.127]  He said, sure, and wrote me a check.
[00:51:29.507 --> 00:51:32.648]  So I'm back to like 16 asking daddy for money, which is fine.
[00:51:32.968 --> 00:51:34.429]  But I'm through my bankruptcy now.
[00:51:34.489 --> 00:51:35.129]  Now I can rebuild.
[00:51:35.149 --> 00:51:36.309]  They're still gonna try to hunt me and stuff.
[00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:37.350]  I don't care.
[00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:42.371]  But my point is, they could shut us down if you don't go to our sponsor, drjonesandactors.com.
[00:51:43.091 --> 00:51:46.673]  Yeah, and you know, another point too, it just shows... Well, what else happened there?
[00:51:46.693 --> 00:51:47.453]  They republished my car.
[00:51:48.356 --> 00:51:49.057]  You want to talk about that?
[00:51:49.657 --> 00:51:50.698]  I pulled up to that today.
[00:51:50.718 --> 00:51:51.879]  I love it.
[00:51:51.919 --> 00:51:52.499]  It's funny to me.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.442]  I literally pull into the parking lot today and Alex's car is being repossessed.
[00:51:57.343 --> 00:51:59.085]  Not a fancy vehicle, a five-year-old Tahoe.
[00:52:00.045 --> 00:52:01.106]  It's just a basic Tahoe.
[00:52:01.927 --> 00:52:05.329]  And I pull up and see the tow truck repossessing it.
[00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.311]  I'm like, oh, what's this?
[00:52:07.331 --> 00:52:09.473]  It's like, oh yeah, they're just taking Alex's car.
[00:52:10.916 --> 00:52:11.797]  Okay, that's what we got.
[00:52:11.997 --> 00:52:14.078]  That's what we deal with around here.
[00:52:14.098 --> 00:52:15.199]  You got the RNC next week.
[00:52:15.219 --> 00:52:16.220]  You need to go to jail, though.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.581]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:24.106]  We got the RNC coming up next week, and people are expecting, I've probably gotten dozens of messages, hey, you're going to the RNC, the N4 is going to the RNC.
[00:52:24.146 --> 00:52:29.290]  Well, we're not allowed to spend money, and I'm on a federal travel ban, so, you know.
[00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:30.270]  Have fun!
[00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.891]  And we're not whining about it, but I literally call my daddy up again.
[00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:33.691]  He literally does it on the street.
[00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:35.092]  I go, Daddy, I know you got an extra car.
[00:52:35.112 --> 00:52:37.493]  He goes, sure, son, and drives over and gives me his old truck.
[00:52:37.533 --> 00:52:38.773]  What's it like being 16 again?
[00:52:38.893 --> 00:52:39.814]  I actually felt good.
[00:52:39.854 --> 00:52:42.895]  Went and met my wife for early dinner, and she laughed about it.
[00:52:42.915 --> 00:52:43.655]  Can I get a ride?
[00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:44.315]  I need a pickup.
[00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:45.996]  I got this old Ford pickup truck.
[00:52:47.267 --> 00:52:50.952]  Which does rattling down the road, but I gotta see that.
[00:52:52.033 --> 00:52:53.034]  I felt good doing it, though.
[00:52:53.074 --> 00:52:54.796]  It was like, I have literally given up.
[00:52:54.816 --> 00:52:56.819]  I didn't have to go to jail like you or Steve Bannon.
[00:52:57.239 --> 00:52:58.621]  I'm like, shit, I'm lucky, man.
[00:52:59.402 --> 00:53:00.403]  So I'm grounded.
[00:53:00.643 --> 00:53:01.705]  You know, I'm grounded.
[00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.928]  You can't, you gotta ask daddy for a car.
[00:53:04.228 --> 00:53:05.289]  You gotta get permission to drive.
[00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:06.551]  I'm grounded.
[00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:07.071]  I can't leave.
[00:53:08.152 --> 00:53:11.395]  Well, that's when I broke down crying the night they tried to come shut us down outside of court order.
[00:53:11.795 --> 00:53:12.916]  I wasn't crying for me.
[00:53:12.996 --> 00:53:15.198]  I was crying for America after being on air eight hours.
[00:53:15.318 --> 00:53:17.060]  I broke down because I'm pissed, folks.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.484]  I mean, this is... I broke down because when I start crying, it's when you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:53:21.504 --> 00:53:23.245]  It's not like I'm crying because I'm a pussy.
[00:53:23.545 --> 00:53:25.347]  It's I'm crying because the emotion's so strong.
[00:53:25.367 --> 00:53:25.868]  Does that make sense?
[00:53:26.963 --> 00:53:27.403]  All right.
[00:53:27.864 --> 00:53:29.565]  We were here to cover a press conference.
[00:53:29.705 --> 00:53:31.827]  Joe Biden is now almost an hour late.
[00:53:32.187 --> 00:53:33.148]  What's going on, guys?
[00:53:33.928 --> 00:53:34.829]  Did they just cut the feed?
[00:53:34.889 --> 00:53:35.650]  Punch it back up.
[00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:36.030]  Go ahead.
[00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:36.931]  Did they cut the feed again?
[00:53:36.951 --> 00:53:38.412]  All right, you got media in the room now.
[00:53:40.658 --> 00:53:43.398]  Oh my God, they're playing like Fantasia music.
[00:53:43.418 --> 00:53:44.699]  Like a pink elephant's about to come.
[00:53:44.739 --> 00:53:46.159]  What the hell is that?
[00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:47.699]  Ballerina, like a pink elephant.
[00:53:47.719 --> 00:53:51.860]  The purple hippopotamus are about to come dancing out on the street.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.520]  Alright, so he's gotta be coming out soon.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.561]  I mean, this is getting out of control.
[00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:57.521]  He's almost an hour late.
[00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:58.941]  He's gotta be coming out soon.
[00:53:58.981 --> 00:53:59.841]  They're jacking him up.
[00:54:00.021 --> 00:54:01.302]  He's gotta get jacked up, Joe.
[00:54:01.342 --> 00:54:01.722]  Here's the thing.
[00:54:01.742 --> 00:54:02.882]  I don't even care if it's scripted.
[00:54:03.162 --> 00:54:06.762]  He'll still fumble and bumble and slur the whole thing, even if it's scripted.
[00:54:07.003 --> 00:54:07.843]  Joe, take some of these.
[00:54:07.903 --> 00:54:08.503]  Take some of these, Joe.
[00:54:08.543 --> 00:54:09.763]  But here's what's interesting.
[00:54:10.768 --> 00:54:20.595]  The biggest story since June 27th, that was the debate, the number one story every single day has been, Joe Biden needs to drop out, Joe Biden is mentally incompetent.
[00:54:21.055 --> 00:54:23.657]  I mean, that has to be what these questions are going to be.
[00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:28.380]  And they moved it, this will cheer everybody up, and then they moved it back two times.
[00:54:29.241 --> 00:54:30.522]  He's two hours late, really.
[00:54:30.902 --> 00:54:31.863]  Yeah, first it was what?
[00:54:31.883 --> 00:54:32.684]  430 Central.
[00:54:32.764 --> 00:54:33.384]  It's now 620 Central.
[00:54:37.748 --> 00:54:39.148]  Rob, let's go back.
[00:54:39.188 --> 00:54:39.588]  This is funny.
[00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.429]  Everybody's like, we're sorry to me.
[00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:43.989]  And I go, hey, I love it when they repossess my car.
[00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:46.330]  Because that's how it works in the bankruptcy.
[00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.090]  I'm not even allowed to have it.
[00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:48.630]  So we were just waiting for them to repossess.
[00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:50.190]  I kept thinking, they thought a month ago they'd come get it.
[00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.431]  Well, I couldn't even, well, really what happened was I couldn't pull in.
[00:54:52.451 --> 00:54:55.351]  I actually called Apple leasing like two weeks ago and I said, hey, here's my address.
[00:54:55.631 --> 00:54:57.031]  Will you please call me when you come get it?
[00:54:57.952 --> 00:54:59.332]  Did they do the surprise routine on you?
[00:54:59.372 --> 00:55:00.332]  No, they didn't call me.
[00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:05.233]  Well, I tried to pull into the parking lot and I couldn't because there was the tow truck.
[00:55:06.087 --> 00:55:07.228]  Pulling your car up to it.
[00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:09.169]  And I'm just like, oh, okay.
[00:55:09.269 --> 00:55:11.310]  So I kind of had to like park into like the short side.
[00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.331]  I went out and gave him the keys too.
[00:55:12.371 --> 00:55:13.391]  I'm like, here's the keys guys.
[00:55:14.272 --> 00:55:19.655]  You know, uh, you know what's funny is, uh, it was like this, this like thin blonde woman.
[00:55:20.456 --> 00:55:22.797]  It was like a, it was like a thin kind of redneck blonde woman.
[00:55:22.817 --> 00:55:26.039]  I mean, she was kind of cute, but it was like, I had to do a double take.
[00:55:26.059 --> 00:55:26.679]  I was like, wait, what?
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.980]  She's sitting there jacking it up.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.122]  This couldn't have weighed more than like 120 pounds.
[00:55:30.142 --> 00:55:32.023]  This blonde woman sitting there jacking it up and like,
[00:55:32.743 --> 00:55:33.543]  Uh, yoga pants.
[00:55:33.904 --> 00:55:34.744]  Like, what the hell?
[00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:35.184]  I like that.
[00:55:35.284 --> 00:55:36.925]  I'm repossessing your car.
[00:55:37.225 --> 00:55:42.987]  I've never seen, like, you think of a repossessing, it's like a dude, kind of burly, big guy, tow truck guy.
[00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:46.788]  This is like a petite woman sitting there jacking up your Tahoe.
[00:55:46.808 --> 00:55:47.869]  I'm like, what the hell?
[00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:49.849]  She did it all by herself.
[00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.231]  The funny thing is, they think, because he's been doing it for 40 minutes.
[00:55:55.515 --> 00:55:56.736]  We're gonna pull up Drudge.
[00:55:56.836 --> 00:55:58.737]  Did they delay it again?
[00:55:59.178 --> 00:56:00.419]  I'm telling you, they're jacking him up.
[00:56:00.779 --> 00:56:02.200]  They're switching out the blood.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.381]  They gotta do all kinds of stuff to him.
[00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:04.962]  He must have had a collapse.
[00:56:05.122 --> 00:56:06.864]  He already thinks that he met with Putin.
[00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:07.924]  Yeah, he said Putin earlier.
[00:56:07.944 --> 00:56:10.807]  I mean, this is a disaster.
[00:56:10.827 --> 00:56:12.588]  But here's where I go back to the repossession.
[00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:15.290]  They literally, the judge did everything they wanted.
[00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.372]  He put the committee of the Sandy Hook parents
[00:56:18.699 --> 00:56:21.281]  Um, now it's at 7pm tonight at Boston Herald.
[00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:22.521]  So they just moved it back.
[00:56:22.802 --> 00:56:23.882]  So that's still East Coast.
[00:56:23.902 --> 00:56:25.603]  So they delayed it again, but he's still late.
[00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:33.668]  But the issue is, they literally are, literally saying on the news, we want pain, we want to hurt him, and it doesn't hurt me.
[00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:37.273]  Like, like, like, it doesn't hurt me.
[00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:40.598]  So I just, again, folks, they want to shut this show down.
[00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:41.559]  Don't let them.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.902]  And take these clips and share them.
[00:56:44.643 --> 00:56:46.606]  And put it out that they repossessed my car today.
[00:56:46.826 --> 00:56:47.627]  Let them celebrate it.
[00:56:47.647 --> 00:56:48.348]  Let it be all over the news.
[00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:52.194]  Because they think the average American hears that's done to me and thinks the average American goes, oh, he's a loser.
[00:56:53.248 --> 00:56:57.950]  I mean, our founding fathers lost everything they had, including many of their lives, for America.
[00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.390]  I'm a pussy compared to them.
[00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:05.932]  I didn't spend three months in jail like him, or for no reason, or Steve Bannon.
[00:57:06.132 --> 00:57:11.434]  You had Douglas Mackey on today, trying to put him in jail for seven months for sharing a joke.
[00:57:12.335 --> 00:57:13.315]  For making a joke.
[00:57:13.735 --> 00:57:16.336]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:57:18.171 --> 00:57:22.254]  Well, and if it can happen to somebody who's been this successful, Alex, it can happen to anybody else.
[00:57:22.274 --> 00:57:24.275]  They can go after anybody and take whatever they want.
[00:57:24.295 --> 00:57:26.377]  That's the message is to intimidate people, Rob.
[00:57:26.477 --> 00:57:26.817]  You're right.
[00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:27.778]  Get everybody to shut up.
[00:57:28.598 --> 00:57:30.180]  I don't think Americans are like that, Rob.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.621]  I don't think the intimidation works.
[00:57:31.941 --> 00:57:32.601]  No.
[00:57:32.661 --> 00:57:34.503]  Americans get pissed off and they see what's going on.
[00:57:34.703 --> 00:57:37.945]  Just like everybody's getting pissed off at what they're doing to Trump, and they can see what's going on.
[00:57:38.645 --> 00:57:43.089]  And Americans also like this, what's on the preview camera right there.
[00:57:44.009 --> 00:57:48.171]  And, but they also don't, when they see somebody getting screwed by the system, it pisses them off.
[00:57:48.351 --> 00:57:49.752]  That's why Trump is so popular.
[00:57:49.812 --> 00:57:49.992]  Yeah.
[00:57:50.272 --> 00:57:54.754]  So, so now they're two hours and 22 minutes late.
[00:57:55.655 --> 00:57:59.317]  Is the media, guys, Google press conference late, Biden press conference late.
[00:57:59.357 --> 00:58:00.397]  Is anyone even reporting?
[00:58:00.617 --> 00:58:01.658]  That's another part of the cover-up.
[00:58:01.838 --> 00:58:03.559]  For years, he acted like he wasn't a vegetable.
[00:58:03.919 --> 00:58:06.560]  And now, where is it that he is super late?
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:12.123]  They just keep delaying and delaying and delaying and stalling and shuffling.
[00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:15.352]  This is truly crazy.
[00:58:17.832 --> 00:58:22.234]  I don't know if I have to look up Biden press conference.
[00:58:22.254 --> 00:58:23.595]  Who's going to ask for the reason?
[00:58:23.795 --> 00:58:25.115]  Who's going to ask for the excuse?
[00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:27.436]  Biden press conference delayed.
[00:58:27.456 --> 00:58:29.037]  Put it on full screen, guys.
[00:58:29.057 --> 00:58:29.977]  My eyes aren't that good anymore.
[00:58:32.398 --> 00:58:33.398]  Delayed, delayed.
[00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:35.279]  So it might miss even.
[00:58:35.299 --> 00:58:36.839]  They're already reporting he's already held it.
[00:58:36.899 --> 00:58:38.360]  What is that New York Post headline?
[00:58:39.667 --> 00:58:40.209]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:58:41.152 --> 00:58:43.159]  Big Boy press conference delayed.
[00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.731]  So it might miss evening news.
[00:58:45.951 --> 00:58:47.452]  What the hell?
[00:58:47.672 --> 00:58:50.794]  They're insinuating they're trying to hide it from the American public, I guess.
[00:58:50.854 --> 00:58:54.836]  Yeah, I think they figured out, okay, he just said that he met with Putin today and Zelensky.
[00:58:55.196 --> 00:58:58.878]  I mean, if you can't get that right, that's like... There's a two-minute... Yeah, he can't even do that.
[00:58:58.898 --> 00:59:00.619]  That's like my grandmother one week before she died.
[00:59:00.759 --> 00:59:04.642]  Super smart lady, 92 years old, right here down the street was her nursing home.
[00:59:06.082 --> 00:59:06.983]  She was in a therapy thing.
[00:59:07.003 --> 00:59:07.923]  She was only nursing home about a year.
[00:59:08.624 --> 00:59:11.986]  And last time I saw her, about a week before she died, and I was actually on a trip when she died,
[00:59:12.686 --> 00:59:15.708]  I actually got married and I was in Hawaii and then they called me, she died and I came back.
[00:59:16.229 --> 00:59:19.351]  And she's like, Bill, Bill, that was my grandfather's name.
[00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:20.372]  I love you, Bill.
[00:59:20.412 --> 00:59:21.052]  Are you there?
[00:59:21.092 --> 00:59:21.773]  Kiss me, Bill.
[00:59:21.793 --> 00:59:25.495]  And I was like, wow, I kiss grandma, but I'm not your husband.
[00:59:25.856 --> 00:59:27.557]  I looked like him when he was young.
[00:59:27.617 --> 00:59:30.179]  But the point was, is that she was gone.
[00:59:30.459 --> 00:59:38.445]  When you don't know who, this is Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, and you think he's Vladimir Putin, folks, you're completely out of your mind.
[00:59:39.281 --> 00:59:42.644]  What time, the debates, the debate started at 8 o'clock.
[00:59:43.565 --> 00:59:46.589]  I think it was the first debate with Trump started at 8 o'clock.
[00:59:46.989 --> 00:59:49.291]  So he's hitting that sundowning period.
[00:59:49.311 --> 00:59:50.713]  Yeah, he gets tired.
[00:59:50.913 --> 00:59:53.295]  Yeah, when you hit that... That's what Secret Service told me.
[00:59:53.335 --> 00:59:54.136]  You can't call him after 8.
[00:59:54.216 --> 00:59:56.699]  And that's what the high-level law enforcement told me.
[00:59:56.719 --> 01:00:02.385]  They said he becomes a total jerk by 7 or 8 and then he wakes up and wanders around naked in the middle of the night.
[01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:07.123]  That's probably why his dogs are biting people, too.
[01:00:07.243 --> 01:00:11.814]  His dogs are probably looking at him as being an injured animal and that they have to protect.
[01:00:11.854 --> 01:00:13.117]  And that's why they're always biting people.
[01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:14.994]  Rob, make your point.
[01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:15.254]  Sorry.
[01:00:15.374 --> 01:00:17.936]  Well, you know, they had all these reports of the dogs biting people.
[01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:25.000]  So if you have a dog and people that he doesn't know are coming around him, like these Secret Service agents, okay, a dog's already going to be protective.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.302]  Well, Biden is, you know, gibbering around.
[01:00:27.682 --> 01:00:28.602]  He's bumping into things.
[01:00:28.642 --> 01:00:29.403]  He's falling over.
[01:00:29.723 --> 01:00:31.044]  So they probably think he's injured.
[01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:31.885]  We got to protect him.
[01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:33.606]  So anybody just walking over to help him up.
[01:00:33.706 --> 01:00:34.426]  Oh, I got to bite you.
[01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:35.187]  You're trying to hurt him.
[01:00:35.587 --> 01:00:36.908]  I think that's what's going on with these dogs.
[01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:39.489]  They're not crazy dogs because a dog's a dog.
[01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.111]  But a dog is always going to protect its master.
[01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:44.753]  Well, especially when he gets trained German Shepherds that are trained to him.
[01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:45.133]  Right.
[01:00:45.293 --> 01:00:45.733]  Exactly.
[01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:47.214]  And I think that's what's going on.
[01:00:47.234 --> 01:00:49.196]  And they're all wigged out because he's out of his mind.
[01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:49.536]  Exactly.
[01:00:49.556 --> 01:00:52.598]  And they see, these German Shepherds see a bunch of strong alpha males.
[01:00:52.658 --> 01:00:53.078]  Exactly.
[01:00:53.098 --> 01:00:54.339]  They're like, he's injured.
[01:00:54.379 --> 01:00:55.060]  I got to protect him.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:55.860]  No, you're dead on, Rob.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.021]  I think it's a derelict family is what I think.
[01:00:58.262 --> 01:01:02.765]  I think they get these German Shepherds that are highly trained and they're just derelict and taking care of it.
[01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:03.965]  No, I agree.
[01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:05.626]  But if he had a poodle or, you know,
[01:01:06.812 --> 01:01:10.173]  A poodle's not going to hurt you biting it, but a big German Shepherd's going to hurt.
[01:01:10.353 --> 01:01:12.733]  I've seen some poodles messing, actually, there was a poodle messing.
[01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:15.094]  All I'm saying is they get trained police dogs.
[01:01:16.154 --> 01:01:17.814]  And they're not used to being around whack jobs.
[01:01:17.834 --> 01:01:21.315]  They've gone from like, they've had like three dogs come through that house.
[01:01:21.395 --> 01:01:21.995]  It's five now.
[01:01:22.135 --> 01:01:22.375]  Five?
[01:01:23.595 --> 01:01:26.416]  Well, you know, they had to, they used to have Secret Service birthday parties.
[01:01:27.176 --> 01:01:32.997]  They got canceled during the Obama presidency because the Bidens would be walking around hitting on people's wives, grabbing their asses and stuff.
[01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:38.383]  Yeah, I mean, they're reportedly like total sex addict pervert swingers.
[01:01:40.024 --> 01:01:41.005]  And so that's the issue.
[01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:45.289]  Well, I'm pretty sure that the Hunter Biden laptop confirms that.
[01:01:45.749 --> 01:01:49.493]  Plus, didn't Joe, I mean, you know, he replaced his wife with the babysitter.
[01:01:49.593 --> 01:01:50.614]  Well, that's Jill.
[01:01:51.515 --> 01:01:52.976]  She wears fishnets on Air Force One.
[01:01:53.316 --> 01:02:00.223]  They admit that Ashley Biden's diary is real where she says, my dad screws me in the shower.
[01:02:02.056 --> 01:02:03.056]  Yeah, they first said it was fake.
[01:02:03.096 --> 01:02:03.717]  Oh, now it's real.
[01:02:03.737 --> 01:02:04.397]  I'm suing to get it back.
[01:02:04.657 --> 01:02:05.718]  Hunter Biden's laptop is fake.
[01:02:05.738 --> 01:02:06.678]  No, now he's suing.
[01:02:06.818 --> 01:02:08.579]  So it's like, oh, it was real the whole time he lied.
[01:02:09.139 --> 01:02:14.342]  And they're saying, ABC reporting, Biden and Trump tied despite debate at 67%.
[01:02:14.442 --> 01:02:16.803]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:02:16.823 --> 01:02:18.784]  There is no way it's a tie poll.
[01:02:20.605 --> 01:02:23.746]  Americans are divided 46 to 47 between Biden and Trump.
[01:02:23.766 --> 01:02:26.547]  Well, let's hear what type of idiotic music they got playing now.
[01:02:26.567 --> 01:02:27.368]  Go ahead and fade this up.
[01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.985]  We're in a museum now.
[01:02:35.045 --> 01:02:36.386]  A wax museum.
[01:02:36.466 --> 01:02:37.388]  More regal music.
[01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:40.432]  Apparently the Marines had to write a new tune for Jill.
[01:02:40.852 --> 01:02:42.574]  She demanded it!
[01:02:42.815 --> 01:02:43.936]  Now that is spectacular.
[01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.870]  My goodness.
[01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:51.851]  Well done with the music.
[01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:54.693]  No, Jill, this woman is such a narcissist.
[01:02:55.213 --> 01:03:01.918]  She demanded that the Marine Band write her theme music that they have to play every time she enters a room or does an event.
[01:03:02.218 --> 01:03:02.779]  I read that.
[01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:03.880]  That's not even real.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.241]  Oh, it's real.
[01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:06.021]  I know.
[01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:07.142]  It doesn't even sound real.
[01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:10.584]  I mean, that's Jill Biden.
[01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:12.106]  Here comes Jill in the fishnets.
[01:03:12.666 --> 01:03:13.647]  Here comes the babysitter.
[01:03:14.943 --> 01:03:15.463]  Here he comes.
[01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:19.206]  That's why, uh, oh, we got, he's made it out two hours late.
[01:03:19.266 --> 01:03:23.950]  Well, good evening.
[01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:27.553]  We just concluded this year's NATO summit.
[01:03:27.993 --> 01:03:30.815]  The consensus among the members was it was a great success.
[01:03:30.855 --> 01:03:40.082]  Especially because it represented the 75th year of the most important military defense alliance in the history of the world.
[01:03:41.043 --> 01:03:44.346]  We should never forget that NATO grew out of the wreckage of World War II.
[01:03:45.646 --> 01:03:46.207]  Teleproperty.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.404]  Attack on one would be treated as an attack on all.
[01:04:06.225 --> 01:04:13.913]  And it's worked because a would-be aggressor knows if they attack one of us, they'll be attacked by all of us.
[01:04:15.174 --> 01:04:20.140]  Sending that message is the best way to deter aggression and prevent wars in the first place.
[01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:27.710]  For those who thought NATO's time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine.
[01:04:28.691 --> 01:04:38.035]  Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life, because once again, a murderous madman was on the march.
[01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:45.059]  But this time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States.
[01:04:45.959 --> 01:04:48.961]  We collected intelligence that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine,
[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:51.391]  Months before the invasion.
[01:04:53.191 --> 01:05:01.695]  I directed the intelligence community to be declassified so I could start building an international coalition to oppose the invasion.
[01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:08.017]  Then in February, some of you remember, I warned the world that the invasion was imminent.
[01:05:09.554 --> 01:05:14.661]  I rallied a coalition of 50 nations from Europe to Asia to help Ukraine defend itself.
[01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:25.417]  Many foreign policy experts thought as Putin amassed Russian forces just 100 miles north of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.
[01:05:26.187 --> 01:05:30.250]  But Putin thought it was the mother home of Russia.
[01:05:31.071 --> 01:05:33.253]  The capital would fall in less than a week.
[01:05:34.134 --> 01:05:38.677]  But the Ukrainian people, backed by a coalition to help build, stopped them.
[01:05:39.558 --> 01:05:42.320]  Today, Kiev still stands.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.324]  And NATO stands, stronger than it has ever been.
[01:05:47.545 --> 01:05:49.006]  During the week of this summit,
[01:05:50.131 --> 01:05:58.235]  Several head of states made it a point in their statements to thank the United States and to thank me personally for all that NATO has achieved.
[01:05:59.195 --> 01:06:09.340]  NATO is not only stronger, NATO is bigger because we led the charge to bring in Finland and Sweden into the alliance and it makes a gigantic difference.
[01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:10.481]  Excuse me.
[01:06:11.508 --> 01:06:14.169]  He's already slurring too, mumbling, mumbling.
[01:06:14.189 --> 01:06:14.589]  Here's what he said.
[01:06:14.609 --> 01:06:14.969]  It was genius.
[01:06:14.989 --> 01:06:15.770]  It was wonderful.
[01:06:36.954 --> 01:06:43.555]  Somebody forgot that, but that's exactly what he said.
[01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:46.136]  Imagine Biden up here, this is like declaring victory.
[01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:56.177]  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have died, a whole generation of men, and they haven't really had any significant victories in Ukraine.
[01:06:56.297 --> 01:06:59.898]  And that was to defend America after 9-11.
[01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:04.939]  I made it clear that I will not bow down to Putin.
[01:07:06.306 --> 01:07:07.787]  I will not walk away from Ukraine.
[01:07:08.788 --> 01:07:10.089]  I will keep NATO strong.
[01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:12.051]  That's exactly what we did.
[01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.693]  And without a teleprompter, he called Zelensky Putin today.
[01:07:15.734 --> 01:07:19.657]  Now, the future of American policy is up to the American people.
[01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:22.659]  This is much more than a political question.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.260]  It's more than that.
[01:07:24.961 --> 01:07:26.482]  It's a national security issue.
[01:07:27.683 --> 01:07:30.125]  Don't redo this to the usual testament.
[01:07:30.345 --> 01:07:30.906]  End of line.
[01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:34.048]  That people talk about the issues of being a political campaign.
[01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:36.330]  It's far too important.
[01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:39.032]  It's about the world we live in.
[01:07:39.052 --> 01:07:42.114]  Yeah, he's invoking World War II.
[01:07:42.274 --> 01:07:42.995]  Every American.
[01:07:43.135 --> 01:07:46.217]  It's like a sign that he wants to start World War III to stay in power or something.
[01:07:46.538 --> 01:07:47.799]  Is the world safer with NATO?
[01:07:48.996 --> 01:07:49.697]  Are you safer?
[01:07:50.578 --> 01:07:50.799]  No.
[01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:52.281]  Actually, no I'm not, Joe.
[01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.826]  We fought Germany with Russia in World War II.
[01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:57.028]  Russia defeated Germany.
[01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:58.109]  Exactly.
[01:07:58.129 --> 01:08:02.776]  And now Ukraine is actually the descendants of the Nazis that are fighting.
[01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:10.013]  So NATO starts World War III, Joe Biden says we're safer because of NATO.
[01:08:10.033 --> 01:08:10.254]  Okay.
[01:08:11.035 --> 01:08:13.618]  Oh, and by the way, Ukraine's not a member of NATO, so there's that.
[01:08:13.759 --> 01:08:14.560]  Yeah, you look at the maps.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.564]  If Russia was moving up against Europe, I'd be like, hey, Russia, stop it right now.
[01:08:17.864 --> 01:08:18.525]  If China was.
[01:08:18.826 --> 01:08:20.729]  But instead, it's NATO moving up against them.
[01:08:23.007 --> 01:08:23.768]  Oh my God.
[01:08:23.888 --> 01:08:24.368]  Oh my God!
[01:08:24.428 --> 01:08:27.070]  So, this is not a big boy press conference.
[01:08:39.219 --> 01:08:42.202]  Alex, do you know how much inflation dropped?
[01:08:42.222 --> 01:08:42.783]  Do you know?
[01:08:43.103 --> 01:08:43.504]  What up?
[01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:45.266]  No, no, but they have a report.
[01:08:45.286 --> 01:08:46.407]  Do you know what the number is?
[01:08:47.188 --> 01:08:48.049]  No.
[01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:48.049]  0.1%.
[01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:50.812]  And that's manipulating numbers.
[01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:50.812]  0.1%.
[01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:53.054]  Inflation since Joe Biden took office, minus 0.1% is 19.9%.
[01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:53.354]  That's it.
[01:08:53.374 --> 01:08:54.856]  That's him dropping inflation.
[01:08:54.896 --> 01:08:56.077]  But you know they game all that.
[01:09:02.344 --> 01:09:02.825]  It doesn't matter.
[01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:05.627]  The average American is paying more for gas, more for energy, more for groceries.
[01:09:05.668 --> 01:09:06.628]  You don't have to tell me.
[01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:07.750]  I can't pay my bills.
[01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:08.530]  Another $2,500 a year.
[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:09.471]  It's a tax of $2,500 a year.
[01:09:09.491 --> 01:09:10.873]  Second, the purpose is to secure the border.
[01:09:11.193 --> 01:09:12.194]  The southern border is working.
[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.952]  No, you wanted amnesty and Trump said don't do an amnesty deal.
[01:09:25.992 --> 01:09:27.652]  You lying sack of shit.
[01:09:49.414 --> 01:09:49.854]  Wow.
[01:09:50.054 --> 01:09:51.315]  Peace in the Middle East?
[01:10:08.024 --> 01:10:11.045]  In writing, it was endorsed by the U.N.
[01:10:11.065 --> 01:10:13.665]  Security Council, the G7.
[01:10:13.685 --> 01:10:18.386]  That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas.
[01:10:19.026 --> 01:10:22.807]  So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details.
[01:10:23.087 --> 01:10:25.607]  These are difficult, complex issues.
[01:10:25.627 --> 01:10:27.948]  There's still gaps to close.
[01:10:27.968 --> 01:10:29.208]  We're making progress.
[01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:31.048]  The trend is positive.
[01:10:31.908 --> 01:10:35.809]  And I'm determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war which should end now.
[01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:38.659]  Let me conclude where I began.
[01:10:39.919 --> 01:10:41.540]  We're the United States of America.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.521]  We are the indispensable nation.
[01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:46.442]  Our leadership matters.
[01:10:47.462 --> 01:10:48.522]  Our partnerships matter.
[01:10:49.963 --> 01:10:51.024]  This moment matters.
[01:10:51.844 --> 01:10:53.244]  We must rise to meet it.
[01:10:54.845 --> 01:10:57.146]  With that, I'll take your questions.
[01:10:57.506 --> 01:11:00.247]  I've been given a list of people to call in here.
[01:11:00.267 --> 01:11:01.068]  He has his script out!
[01:11:01.768 --> 01:11:02.968]  Reuters, Jeff Mason.
[01:11:02.988 --> 01:11:04.629]  Alright, let's take the hot chicks off the screen.
[01:11:04.649 --> 01:11:05.749]  He's reading off his script!
[01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:06.870]  Alright, let's go full screen.
[01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:13.763]  Mr. President, your political future has hung over the NATO Summit a little bit this week.
[01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:19.266]  Speaker Pelosi made a point of suggesting that your decision on whether to stay in the race was still open.
[01:11:19.826 --> 01:11:24.348]  George Clooney and a handful of lawmakers have called on you to step aside.
[01:11:24.428 --> 01:11:29.091]  Reuters is reporting tonight that UAW leadership is concerned about your ability to win.
[01:11:29.771 --> 01:11:31.892]  UAW just endorsed me, but go ahead.
[01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:33.082]  Thank you.
[01:11:34.564 --> 01:11:38.947]  My question for you is, how are you incorporating these developments into your decision to stay?
[01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:39.448]  Look how plump he is.
[01:11:39.568 --> 01:11:40.388]  He's got a bunch of blood.
[01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:49.836]  And separately, what concerns do you have about Vice President Harris' ability to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket?
[01:11:50.396 --> 01:11:50.677]  Wow.
[01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:57.462]  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be Vice President, so he's not qualified to be President.
[01:11:58.143 --> 01:11:58.843]  So let's start there.
[01:11:59.964 --> 01:12:00.445]  Number one,
[01:12:01.587 --> 01:12:09.270]  The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president.
[01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:12.632]  I beat him once and I will beat him again.
[01:12:12.652 --> 01:12:14.913]  So he just said he met with Putin today?
[01:12:15.593 --> 01:12:17.694]  He wouldn't have picked Trump to be his vice president if he could win.
[01:12:17.854 --> 01:12:18.934]  I think that's a good pick for Biden.
[01:12:18.954 --> 01:12:19.975]  He should probably go with Trump.
[01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:23.971]  Biden could be his VP.
[01:12:24.051 --> 01:12:26.673]  I might vote Biden if Trump was his VP.
[01:12:26.734 --> 01:12:28.695]  Because Trump would eventually be president anyway.
[01:12:28.715 --> 01:12:35.661]  Notice as soon as they turn the teleprompter off, he does... He's a gibbering idiot.
[01:12:41.753 --> 01:12:42.674]  Later in the campaign.
[01:12:42.694 --> 01:12:43.535]  You're doing the whisper thing now.
[01:12:43.555 --> 01:12:46.118]  There's a long way to go in this campaign.
[01:12:46.478 --> 01:12:47.239]  Long way to go.
[01:12:48.521 --> 01:12:49.702]  I'm just gonna keep moving.
[01:12:49.962 --> 01:12:50.423]  It works.
[01:12:50.483 --> 01:12:51.044]  Keep moving.
[01:12:51.404 --> 01:12:53.066]  And because, look, I got more work to do.
[01:12:53.086 --> 01:12:54.367]  I got more work to finish.
[01:12:54.387 --> 01:12:55.769]  There's so much.
[01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:57.451]  We've made so much progress.
[01:12:57.931 --> 01:12:58.472]  Think about it.
[01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:00.774]  Think about what we are economically.
[01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:05.823]  Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy.
[01:13:05.863 --> 01:13:07.524]  He hasn't said the idea yet.
[01:13:07.564 --> 01:13:08.524]  The idea!
[01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:10.986]  We've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
[01:13:11.006 --> 01:13:11.666]  1.5 million jobs.
[01:13:11.706 --> 01:13:13.207]  I mean, so things are moving.
[01:13:13.968 --> 01:13:14.748]  We've got more to go.
[01:13:14.768 --> 01:13:17.530]  Working class people still need help.
[01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:19.771]  Corporate greed is still at large.
[01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:21.092]  I love they do this, Alex.
[01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:25.135]  It's the greatest economy ever, but also people are really struggling and only I can help them.
[01:13:25.811 --> 01:13:26.412]  They're coming down.
[01:13:26.432 --> 01:13:37.673]  Remember when he said gas stations are why you're caught so anybody that knows anything knows the average gas station loses money on gas and make money on lottery tickets and cigarettes and soda pop.
[01:13:38.277 --> 01:13:39.238]  Here's back to the script now.
[01:13:39.578 --> 01:13:39.898]  Let's go back.
[01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:40.279]  Let's go back.
[01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:41.139]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:48.666]  I wanted to ask you about your, uh, you mixed up, uh, President, uh, Zelensky and Putin earlier today.
[01:13:48.686 --> 01:13:51.348]  That foreigner has to do it.
[01:13:51.508 --> 01:13:54.150]  And you now have sort of your key allies, including the British.
[01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:56.412]  You also just said Trump was your VP.
[01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.495]  The German chancellor having to step in and make excuses for you on that.
[01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:03.937]  Officials here are saying off the record that your decline has become noticeable.
[01:14:04.497 --> 01:14:08.059]  Hasn't this now, frankly, become damaging for America's standing in the world?
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:08.840]  Thank you.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.501]  Did you see any damage to our standing in my leading this conference?
[01:14:12.502 --> 01:14:14.382]  Have you seen a more successful conference?
[01:14:14.843 --> 01:14:15.603]  Oh, he's mad now.
[01:14:16.544 --> 01:14:24.808]  And the Putin piece, I was talking about Putin and I said, and now, at the very end, I said here, I mean Putin, I said, no, I'm sorry, Zelensky.
[01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:29.468]  And then I added five other names.
[01:14:29.568 --> 01:14:40.637]  Look, guys, the idea, anybody suggests that we haven't had an incredibly successful conference.
[01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:45.020]  How many times did you hear in that conference?
[01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:50.485]  I know it sounds too self-serving, but other leaders, heads of state,
[01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:54.078]  In thanking me, saying the reason we're together is because of Biden.
[01:14:54.738 --> 01:14:55.799]  Yeah, oh, they want our money.
[01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:56.619]  What do you know?
[01:14:57.379 --> 01:14:59.680]  Joe's gonna cut us another check, Alex, and they like him.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.141]  Wow!
[01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:02.221]  Well, anyway.
[01:15:02.682 --> 01:15:03.422]  Oh, there it is!
[01:15:03.742 --> 01:15:06.523]  I thought it was the most successful conference I've attended in a long time.
[01:15:07.263 --> 01:15:10.245]  They find me a world leader who didn't think it was.
[01:15:10.285 --> 01:15:10.785]  You know the thing.
[01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:12.365]  Next one.
[01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:13.786]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:13.906 --> 01:15:14.706]  Nancy Cordes.
[01:15:14.726 --> 01:15:15.667]  Go back to the script.
[01:15:15.747 --> 01:15:16.067]  At CBS.
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.891]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:24.113]  You mentioned other instances in history where presidents have faced a challenge.
[01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:32.338]  But what makes this moment in history so unique is that it is not your enemies who are calling on you to reconsider your decision to stay in the race.
[01:15:32.398 --> 01:15:37.581]  It's your friends, supporters, people who think you've done a great job over the past four years.
[01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:45.986]  Have you spent time thinking about what it would mean for your legacy, which you've worked decades to build, if you stay in the race?
[01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:54.472]  Despite the concerns that voters say they have, and you lose to someone who you yourself have argued is unfit to return to the Oval Office.
[01:15:54.892 --> 01:15:55.212]  Well, look.
[01:15:58.715 --> 01:16:00.036]  I'm not in this for my legacy.
[01:16:00.496 --> 01:16:01.217]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:16:01.897 --> 01:16:03.418]  I'm in this to complete the job I started.
[01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:04.279]  You're 10% as the big guy.
[01:16:05.219 --> 01:16:06.901]  As you recall, understandably,
[01:16:07.765 --> 01:16:13.907]  Many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward can't do that.
[01:16:13.927 --> 01:16:14.927]  It's going to cause inflation.
[01:16:14.947 --> 01:16:16.168]  Things are going to skyrocket.
[01:16:16.288 --> 01:16:17.208]  Debt's going to go up.
[01:16:18.768 --> 01:16:23.370]  What are you hearing now from mainstream economists?
[01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:25.670]  16 economic Nobel laureates.
[01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:26.951]  51 people said the laptop's not real.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.262]  Oh, does Paul Krugman say the Internet's like a fax machine?
[01:16:31.782 --> 01:16:33.743]  You're not paying more for food, Americans.
[01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:35.043]  You're not paying more for gas.
[01:16:35.063 --> 01:16:36.504]  You're not paying more for your grocery bill.
[01:16:36.524 --> 01:16:39.005]  You're not paying more for your electric bill.
[01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:40.906]  Somebody on television said you weren't.
[01:16:41.207 --> 01:16:43.228]  Stop the trickle-down economic theory.
[01:16:44.128 --> 01:16:46.689]  If the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well.
[01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:50.051]  My dad was a well-read, decent guy.
[01:16:50.071 --> 01:16:53.193]  I don't remember much trickling down on his kitchen table.
[01:16:54.273 --> 01:16:57.395]  Middle-class people and working-class people need help.
[01:16:58.419 --> 01:16:59.019]  There it is again.
[01:16:59.059 --> 01:17:01.300]  So see, the economy's great, but everybody needs help, Alex.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.040]  And there's no inflation.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.781]  99% of the billionaire money goes to him, not Trump.
[01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:27.576]  I doubt that's true.
[01:17:46.559 --> 01:17:48.260]  It's time things get back in order.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:56.183]  It's time, for example, if I'm re-elected, we're going to make sure that rents are kept at 5% increase.
[01:17:56.243 --> 01:18:01.525]  Corporate rents for apartments and the like and homes are limited to 5%.
[01:18:01.585 --> 01:18:07.487]  We're going to make a lot of changes that I've been talking about because we're going to continue to grow this economy.
[01:18:07.968 --> 01:18:08.608]  And by the way,
[01:18:09.489 --> 01:18:09.810]  I know.
[01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:13.613]  Remember how I got so roundly criticized for being so pro-union?
[01:18:13.673 --> 01:18:14.294]  Not labor.
[01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:15.055]  Union.
[01:18:15.535 --> 01:18:15.836]  Union.
[01:18:16.837 --> 01:18:17.497]  Well, guess what?
[01:18:18.498 --> 01:18:20.841]  I've been the most pro-union leader in present-day history.
[01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:22.330]  Not a joke.
[01:18:22.891 --> 01:18:23.391]  And guess what?
[01:18:23.411 --> 01:18:24.271]  Not a joke.
[01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:26.273]  We had the Treasury Department do a study.
[01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:27.473]  He's had all his buzzwords.
[01:18:27.493 --> 01:18:30.355]  When you just do better, everybody does better.
[01:18:31.515 --> 01:18:32.556]  Everybody does better.
[01:18:32.576 --> 01:18:33.396]  Just take the shot.
[01:18:33.436 --> 01:18:43.962]  Can you talk about how, for example, when I went, I remember when we talked about getting the computer chip industry back in the United States, it used to be 40% of the industry.
[01:18:44.002 --> 01:18:45.103]  We invented the chip.
[01:18:46.143 --> 01:18:58.870]  40% of the industries in the United States and former presidents decided that the best way to do is to find the cheapest labor in the world, send the product over there, and import what the product was.
[01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:04.313]  I was told not to go over to Europe, I mean to Asia, including Europe, but Asia.
[01:19:05.214 --> 01:19:07.275]  I remember going to South Korea.
[01:19:08.055 --> 01:19:09.396]  Look at how his face is like.
[01:19:11.681 --> 01:19:12.741]  It's like he gained 10 pounds.
[01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.302]  They put so much blood into him.
[01:19:14.322 --> 01:19:16.983]  Just like Lance Armstrong, blood-dub folks, what you do with this.
[01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:17.963]  The Queen of England does it.
[01:19:18.443 --> 01:19:19.743]  Before she died, her mother did it.
[01:19:20.303 --> 01:19:21.344]  He is blood-dubbed.
[01:19:21.364 --> 01:19:25.025]  He has got just surging blood in him from like 10-year-olds.
[01:19:25.105 --> 01:19:34.087]  So the whole idea here is, we've invested over $50 billion in investment in computer chip manufacturing just coming into being.
[01:19:34.628 --> 01:19:36.828]  The drinking game is every time he says idea.
[01:19:36.848 --> 01:19:37.669]  He normally doesn't.
[01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:38.609]  What about when he whispers?
[01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:40.030]  Oh, he's whispering.
[01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:42.933]  So what, he went on two and a half hours late?
[01:19:42.953 --> 01:19:43.414]  He kept moving it back?
[01:19:43.434 --> 01:19:44.155]  So he's gone 14 minutes.
[01:20:00.393 --> 01:20:01.313]  Place bets now.
[01:20:01.654 --> 01:20:03.294]  I bet he goes 45 minutes.
[01:20:03.314 --> 01:20:04.915]  What do you think?
[01:20:05.215 --> 01:20:06.536]  He'll be done by 7 local.
[01:20:06.556 --> 01:20:07.216]  Central.
[01:20:07.376 --> 01:20:08.397]  Yeah.
[01:20:08.797 --> 01:20:09.517]  He's done in 17 minutes.
[01:20:09.537 --> 01:20:09.817]  16 minutes.
[01:20:09.837 --> 01:20:10.978]  And I think we get another 25 out of it.
[01:20:19.184 --> 01:20:22.945]  Your Vice President Kamala Harris would be ready to serve on day one.
[01:20:23.005 --> 01:20:24.246]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:32.089]  What is it about her attributes and her accomplishments over the last four years that make her ready to serve on day one if necessary?
[01:20:32.779 --> 01:20:38.143]  First of all, the way she's handled the issue of freedom of women's bodies to have control over their bodies.
[01:20:38.843 --> 01:20:41.945]  Secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board.
[01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:44.026]  This was a hell of a prosecutor.
[01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:48.229]  She was a first-rate person and in the Senate she was really good.
[01:20:48.309 --> 01:20:51.351]  I couldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president.
[01:20:52.292 --> 01:20:53.152]  From the very beginning.
[01:20:53.773 --> 01:20:55.033]  I made no bones about that.
[01:20:55.994 --> 01:20:57.495]  She is qualified to be president.
[01:20:58.075 --> 01:20:58.836]  That's why I picked her.
[01:21:02.884 --> 01:21:05.105]  Felicia Schwartz, Financial Times.
[01:21:06.925 --> 01:21:07.965]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:21:08.605 --> 01:21:12.166]  Presidency is the most straining job in the world, and it's 24-7.
[01:21:12.646 --> 01:21:16.807]  How can you say you'll be up for that next year, in two years, in four years?
[01:21:16.847 --> 01:21:20.608]  The big jingle is, he's two and a half hours late, all the knives are out for Biden.
[01:21:22.329 --> 01:21:23.709]  The limits I've acknowledged I have?
[01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:29.611]  There's been reporting that you've acknowledged that you need to go to bed earlier, and you're evening around eight.
[01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:30.951]  That's not true.
[01:21:32.201 --> 01:21:43.658]  Look, what I said was, starting at seven and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more.
[01:21:44.459 --> 01:21:47.083]  And I said, for example, the eight, seven, six stuff,
[01:21:47.896 --> 01:21:51.378]  Instead of starting the fundraiser at 9 o'clock, start at 8 o'clock.
[01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.539]  People get to go home by 10 o'clock.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.500]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:05.146]  I'm not talking about... and if you look at my schedule since I've... since I made that stupid mistake in the campaign... in the debate... I mean...
[01:22:06.175 --> 01:22:07.856]  My schedule has been full bore.
[01:22:08.656 --> 01:22:09.876]  He stole the election.
[01:22:09.916 --> 01:22:11.577]  He's a puppet.
[01:22:11.737 --> 01:22:12.878]  It's blown up in their face.
[01:22:12.898 --> 01:22:16.159]  I mean, look.
[01:22:16.219 --> 01:22:19.920]  He's done virtually nothing.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.201]  Trump has more energy than a 20-year-old man.
[01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:24.222]  Trump just spoke for two hours earlier.
[01:22:24.622 --> 01:22:26.463]  He just literally said Trump is low energy.
[01:22:26.503 --> 01:22:27.063]  Yeah, right.
[01:22:27.463 --> 01:22:28.264]  Energizer Bunny.
[01:22:28.564 --> 01:22:31.725]  I just think it's better
[01:22:32.794 --> 01:22:34.075]  Guys, let's make a video of Trump.
[01:22:34.095 --> 01:22:35.015]  Pull up Energizer Bunny.
[01:22:35.035 --> 01:22:36.996]  In fact, I want a meme.
[01:22:37.056 --> 01:22:38.997]  I want to put Trump's head on Energizer Bunny.
[01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:40.318]  I want it by tomorrow.
[01:22:40.338 --> 01:22:41.719]  For the Friday show, 11 a.m.
[01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:42.059]  Central.
[01:22:42.099 --> 01:22:42.599]  I want that.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:43.760]  I want it now.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.361]  I want it on X now.
[01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:48.543]  Trump versus Biden.
[01:22:48.623 --> 01:22:50.404]  I want to show Trump as Energizer Bunny.
[01:22:50.544 --> 01:22:52.645]  And then how we describe Biden.
[01:22:52.685 --> 01:22:53.145]  Like, paint him.
[01:22:53.165 --> 01:22:57.027]  There's that video of Biden as the old man, like, just barely punching the bag.
[01:22:57.087 --> 01:22:57.848]  Or we show a sloth.
[01:22:58.519 --> 01:23:00.080]  A slop on a tree with his head.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.621]  Versus Energizer Bunny?
[01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:03.182]  Bad things all the time.
[01:23:03.602 --> 01:23:04.502]  Oh, he's whispering.
[01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:05.083]  Oh, let's go back to him.
[01:23:05.123 --> 01:23:07.764]  I'm catching hell from my wife for that.
[01:23:07.864 --> 01:23:17.530]  Anyway... Anyway, um... I'm sorry, uh... Zeke Miller, Associated Press.
[01:23:18.968 --> 01:23:20.769]  Every question is about... Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:21.750]  Two questions for you.
[01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:37.378]  First, on the NATO Summit, President Zelensky, in your meeting with him, he pressed you to lift your limitations on the Ukrainian use of American weapons, saying that, in his public remarks, saying that Ukraine cannot win the war unless those limitations are lifted.
[01:23:37.558 --> 01:23:39.699]  Are you reconsidering your position on that?
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.461]  And then secondly, following up on Felicia's question there,
[01:23:43.081 --> 01:23:48.204]  Leaders of your own party have said that they're not worried about that debate.
[01:23:48.304 --> 01:23:51.405]  They're worried about the next bad night and the bad night after that.
[01:23:52.046 --> 01:23:58.729]  How can you reassure the American people that you are up to the task and that there won't be more bad nights at a debate stage or somewhere else?
[01:23:58.749 --> 01:24:01.150]  They've all been told to go after him, which shows they're done with Biden.
[01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:07.874]  First of all, about Zelensky asking for the ability to shrink deep into Russia.
[01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:19.761]  We've allowed Zelensky to use American weapons in the near term, in the near abroad, into Russia.
[01:24:20.982 --> 01:24:27.329]  Whether or not he has, he should be attacked, for example, should Zelensky, he's not.
[01:24:27.889 --> 01:24:33.174]  If he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense?
[01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:34.678]  It wouldn't.
[01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:38.862]  The question is, what's the best use of the weaponry he has?
[01:24:38.882 --> 01:24:40.964]  He said that's World War III a year and a half ago.
[01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:42.705]  What they're doing?
[01:24:43.006 --> 01:24:48.070]  I've gotten a more long-range capacity, as well as defensive capacity.
[01:24:48.971 --> 01:24:53.735]  And so, our military is where I'm following the advice of my Commander-in-Chief.
[01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.636]  Russia blows up half of these things.
[01:24:54.696 --> 01:24:54.856]  Hold on!
[01:24:54.876 --> 01:24:55.396]  His Commander-in-Chief?
[01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:56.417]  He has a Commander-in-Chief?
[01:24:56.437 --> 01:24:57.218]  He has a Commander-in-Chief?
[01:25:02.779 --> 01:25:07.283]  And we're making a day-to-day basis on what they should and shouldn't, how far they should go in.
[01:25:07.904 --> 01:25:09.165]  That's a logical thing to do.
[01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:12.808]  Second question related to... Bad nights.
[01:25:13.028 --> 01:25:13.468]  Bad nights.
[01:25:13.548 --> 01:25:20.534]  Sir, how can you reassure the American people that you won't have more bad nights, whether they be on a debate stage or it's a matter of foreign policy?
[01:25:20.554 --> 01:25:21.915]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:25:21.935 --> 01:25:26.619]  The best way to assure them is the way I assure myself.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.222]  And that is, am I getting the job done?
[01:25:30.385 --> 01:25:31.486]  Am I getting the job done?
[01:25:32.606 --> 01:25:37.048]  Can you name me somebody who's gotten more major piece of legislation passed in three and a half years?
[01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:40.430]  I got created 2,000 jobs just last week.
[01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:41.370]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:44.452]  So if I slow down, I can't get the job done.
[01:25:44.512 --> 01:25:46.813]  That's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it.
[01:25:47.713 --> 01:25:49.294]  But there's no indication of that yet.
[01:25:50.075 --> 01:25:50.295]  None.
[01:25:53.016 --> 01:25:54.817]  Um, what do we got here?
[01:26:02.868 --> 01:26:03.549]  Polsky Radio.
[01:26:05.853 --> 01:26:06.774]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:07.154]  How are you?
[01:26:07.655 --> 01:26:08.056]  I'm well.
[01:26:10.539 --> 01:26:12.242]  The elections in the U.S.
[01:26:12.302 --> 01:26:14.004]  have consequences around the world.
[01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:17.170]  You have pretty high standing in Europe.
[01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:24.697]  I just asked President Macron about you and he said we are happy to have him as the President of the United States.
[01:26:25.538 --> 01:26:27.980]  But there is a concern.
[01:26:29.722 --> 01:26:36.368]  Many people in Poland and across Europe are worried that the former president may win the election.
[01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:40.411]  And there's a lot of concern that
[01:26:42.483 --> 01:26:53.395]  Donald Trump may weaken NATO, stop supporting Ukraine, or push Ukraine to give up territories to Russia.
[01:26:53.455 --> 01:26:53.956]  They're correct.
[01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:57.660]  And you yourself was warning just two minutes ago.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.041]  We need the US money and weapons!
[01:26:59.101 --> 01:26:59.662]  We need it!
[01:26:59.702 --> 01:27:00.182]  We need it!
[01:27:00.242 --> 01:27:00.643]  Give us!
[01:27:00.703 --> 01:27:00.943]  Give us!
[01:27:00.983 --> 01:27:01.684]  So my question is...
[01:27:03.408 --> 01:27:09.689]  Do you think that Europe will be left on its own if Donald Trump wins the election?
[01:27:10.449 --> 01:27:12.109]  And what's your advice to European leaders?
[01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:13.130]  Yes, Europe can't be on its own!
[01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:14.750]  We need all the American money!
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:15.930]  We need you, America!
[01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.190]  Give us all of your stuff!
[01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:18.151]  Give us everything!
[01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:22.251]  You attack Putin, he fight back, now we need, you need to vote for you!
[01:27:24.232 --> 01:27:29.252]  I think, how can I say this without sounding too self-serving?
[01:27:29.732 --> 01:27:32.493]  I'm not handing any of my
[01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:37.883]  European allies come up to me and say, Joe, don't run.
[01:27:39.263 --> 01:27:41.764]  What I hear them say is, you've got to win.
[01:27:41.784 --> 01:27:44.884]  You can't let this guy come forward.
[01:27:45.985 --> 01:27:46.845]  He'd be a disaster.
[01:27:48.445 --> 01:27:49.145]  He'd be a disaster.
[01:27:49.285 --> 01:27:50.425]  He'll end World War III.
[01:27:50.605 --> 01:27:52.606]  I mean... We can't have that, Joe.
[01:27:52.786 --> 01:27:59.407]  I think he said in one of his rallies, don't hold me to this, where NATO, I just learned about NATO, or something to that effect.
[01:28:00.488 --> 01:28:02.288]  Foreign policy has never been his strong point.
[01:28:03.451 --> 01:28:07.032]  And he seems to have an affinity to people who are authoritarian.
[01:28:08.213 --> 01:28:11.834]  That worries, as I tell you, that worries Europe.
[01:28:12.554 --> 01:28:13.474]  That worries Poland.
[01:28:14.215 --> 01:28:19.076]  And nobody, including the people of Poland, thinks that if he wins in Ukraine, he's going to stop in Ukraine.
[01:28:19.677 --> 01:28:20.637]  That's going to be the end of it.
[01:28:21.537 --> 01:28:23.418]  And so, what I can say is,
[01:28:24.742 --> 01:28:27.563]  I think I'm the best qualified person to do the job.
[01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:29.383]  I'll say this.
[01:28:29.423 --> 01:28:34.744]  He's doing a terrible job, but his C-minus is like an A-plus compared to other stuff.
[01:28:35.144 --> 01:28:36.965]  They put him on a bunch of blood, a bunch of drugs.
[01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:38.565]  That's why he's two and a half hours late.
[01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:40.186]  They got him ready to go.
[01:28:40.406 --> 01:28:43.626]  And he's doing a terrible job, but compared to the normal Biden, it's pretty good, actually.
[01:28:43.646 --> 01:28:44.947]  Yeah, he's great on a curve.
[01:28:45.307 --> 01:28:49.908]  Right after he got elected in Geneva, and he was talking about
[01:28:50.863 --> 01:28:54.584]  What we should do, we couldn't be in Eastern Europe, etc.
[01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:59.625]  And I said, you're looking for the Findelization of Ukraine.
[01:29:00.746 --> 01:29:02.906]  Cause you're gonna get the NATOization of Finland.
[01:29:04.227 --> 01:29:07.368]  And about four weeks later I got a call, now that's not true.
[01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:11.409]  Probably five months later, from the President of Finland, could he come and see me?
[01:29:13.309 --> 01:29:15.890]  In my office, and I invited him to the Oval Office.
[01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:19.291]  We sat down and talked, he said he wanted to join NATO, could I help?
[01:29:20.296 --> 01:29:20.756]  And I did.
[01:29:20.776 --> 01:29:22.278]  It wasn't automatic.
[01:29:22.298 --> 01:29:23.499]  Yeah, you're about to get $10 million.
[01:29:23.519 --> 01:29:24.960]  And then I got a call from the Swedes.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.862]  Yeah, Finland's like, hey, how do I get some of this money from NATO?
[01:29:27.882 --> 01:29:29.003]  Hey, how do I get some of this cash?
[01:29:29.444 --> 01:29:30.424]  Let me get some of this cash.
[01:29:34.868 --> 01:29:36.129]  What's going on?
[01:29:36.249 --> 01:29:39.492]  And so Finland joined NATO.
[01:29:40.673 --> 01:29:45.595]  800 mile border is significant, and they're already allies, but they weren't part of NATO.
[01:29:45.615 --> 01:29:51.857]  He's completely out of his mind, but I'm saying... I think you heard maybe... He already called Zelensky Putin today.
[01:29:51.877 --> 01:29:59.499]  He already called Trump his VP, so he's already... But compared to what it could be, let's be honest, he's... This is only a disaster.
[01:29:59.559 --> 01:30:01.220]  ...decided they had to be part of NATO.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.921]  It was in our interest because of the joint
[01:30:04.779 --> 01:30:08.823]  Oh yeah, Russia's gonna attack Finland.
[01:30:08.843 --> 01:30:11.446]  Only if Finland starts attacking the Russians.
[01:30:11.586 --> 01:30:13.327]  And meanwhile, the wide open borders...
[01:30:27.472 --> 01:30:30.173]  But my god, NATO admits they started it, folks.
[01:30:30.213 --> 01:30:30.573]  Jesus.
[01:30:31.053 --> 01:30:31.773]  Owen, I'm not gonna do this.
[01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:32.374]  You kicked my ass.
[01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:33.054]  I'm afraid of punches.
[01:30:33.074 --> 01:30:33.754]  You almost broke my arm.
[01:30:34.234 --> 01:30:38.856]  If I walked over and punched you in the nose and you kicked my ass, I started it, right, Owen?
[01:30:39.056 --> 01:30:39.736]  Not even like that.
[01:30:40.056 --> 01:30:43.277]  If somebody gets in your face, it's like, just get in your face.
[01:30:43.717 --> 01:30:44.638]  Like, yeah, yeah, come on.
[01:30:44.838 --> 01:30:45.658]  Like, yeah, let's do this.
[01:30:45.678 --> 01:30:46.478]  Just get in your face.
[01:30:46.578 --> 01:30:47.939]  Then you're like, boom!
[01:30:49.605 --> 01:30:59.249]  You know, that's what NATO is, they're just in their face like, yeah, c'mon Russia, c'mon, hit me Russia, c'mon, c'mon Russia, hit me, c'mon Russia, c'mon, hit me, c'mon Russia, let's have a war, c'mon, c'mon Russia!
[01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:01.971]  And then they finally give it to them.
[01:31:02.271 --> 01:31:02.971]  Like, okay.
[01:31:02.991 --> 01:31:04.212]  But they don't even do that, that's not even true!
[01:31:04.552 --> 01:31:06.973]  They've gone into Ukraine, they've liberated eastern Ukraine.
[01:31:06.993 --> 01:31:09.714]  No, they said, we're gonna take the east and just kill all the NATO troops.
[01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:11.475]  And that's what they've been doing, just slowly killing them.
[01:31:13.427 --> 01:31:16.413]  They didn't try to take Kiev, that's not a lie.
[01:31:16.573 --> 01:31:19.118]  They diverted troops into Kiev so they could take the east.
[01:31:19.278 --> 01:31:23.326]  But imagine, as they sit here and they talk, oh NATO, strong borders, NATO, strong borders.
[01:31:23.787 --> 01:31:25.350]  All of Europe's borders are wide open.
[01:31:26.827 --> 01:31:34.031]  The NATO declaration that was issued yesterday was very notable because it described China as a decisive enabler of the war in Ukraine.
[01:31:47.957 --> 01:31:49.279]  China's doing drills in Belarus right now.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.621]  We're good to go.
[01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:41.672]  And along the way, could you also tell us whether you think, just to follow up on Felicia's question, that if you were in a room with Vladimir Putin again, the way you were three years ago, or with President Xi, that a few years from now you will be able to go negotiate with them, handle them one-on-one?
[01:32:43.253 --> 01:32:50.721]  Well, the first part of the question is, we discussed and I raised in the NATO Summit, and others raised,
[01:32:52.089 --> 01:32:53.930]  So these are pre-prepared?
[01:32:54.431 --> 01:32:55.271]  The pre-prepared, though.
[01:32:55.291 --> 01:32:57.293]  You saw he looked down, the question's written.
[01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:24.091]  And by the way, I handed all my notes.
[01:33:25.612 --> 01:33:29.735]  But my point is that... He handed in all his notes to the CIA?
[01:33:29.755 --> 01:33:49.651]  She believes that China is a large enough market that they can entice any country, including European countries, to invest there in return for commitments from Europe to do A, B, C, or D, or not to do certain things.
[01:33:50.845 --> 01:34:19.452]  What's happened is, we had a long discussion about what we cannot, we have to make clear China has to understand, that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, along with working with North Korea and others, which they are, to help Russia in armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that, by getting the kind of service they're looking for.
[01:34:20.626 --> 01:34:32.349]  And so, for example, we're in a situation where, and we've re-established direct contact with China after that, remember the balloon, quote-unquote, going down?
[01:34:32.389 --> 01:34:33.089]  Oh, re-establish.
[01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:34.430]  All of a sudden, things came to an end.
[01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:35.930]  The spy balloon that you let spy on us.
[01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:37.130]  No, we set up a new mechanism.
[01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:46.173]  There's a direct line between she and me, and our military has direct access to one another, and they contact one another when we have problems.
[01:34:47.503 --> 01:35:03.918]  The issue is that we have to make sure that she understands there's a price to pay for undercutting both the Pacific Basin as well as Europe.
[01:35:04.519 --> 01:35:04.879]  I don't care!
[01:35:04.919 --> 01:35:08.943]  And that relates to Russia and dealing with Ukraine.
[01:35:10.144 --> 01:35:12.086]  And so we, for example,
[01:35:15.362 --> 01:35:18.923]  If you want to invest in China, as you know, you know this area really well.
[01:35:19.543 --> 01:35:22.824]  If you want to invest in China, you have to have a 51% Chinese owner.
[01:35:23.824 --> 01:35:26.124]  You have to make sure that you do by their rules.
[01:35:26.144 --> 01:35:27.905]  I know, it's all about this.
[01:35:27.925 --> 01:35:32.846]  You don't have the authority, and you have to provide all access to all the data and information you have.
[01:35:33.806 --> 01:35:42.808]  There was a while there, as you recall, in the last administration, and other administrations, where the access to that market was enticing enough to get companies to come in.
[01:35:43.954 --> 01:35:49.340]  Because they had access to over a billion people in the market.
[01:35:50.021 --> 01:35:53.425]  Not a billion, but a lot of people in the market.
[01:35:53.445 --> 01:35:54.946]  And so they were doing it.
[01:35:55.747 --> 01:36:01.313]  But that got curtailed when we started saying we're going to play by the same rules.
[01:36:02.074 --> 01:36:02.655]  For example,
[01:36:03.573 --> 01:36:10.777]  The idea that they don't abide by the international rules related to subsidizing products under government funding.
[01:36:11.157 --> 01:36:11.717]  No, no, no.
[01:36:11.797 --> 01:36:13.958]  I'm saying it's going to be worse.
[01:36:14.078 --> 01:36:15.939]  I mean, he's getting through it.
[01:36:16.019 --> 01:36:16.880]  No, he's getting worse.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:17.600]  You're right.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.301]  And the longer they go, the worse it's going to get.
[01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:21.842]  No, I was saying it's going to be worse.
[01:36:22.242 --> 01:36:23.203]  He's made it past seven.
[01:36:24.286 --> 01:36:27.648]  He's been going, what, 45 minutes?
[01:36:27.828 --> 01:36:29.349]  But it's like a struggle, you know?
[01:36:29.389 --> 01:36:30.450]  It's been like a real struggle.
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:31.750]  It's like drying paint.
[01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:34.632]  No, but I'm saying, I agree, but I'm saying it could have been worse.
[01:36:35.613 --> 01:36:36.813]  Definitely could have been worse.
[01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:44.057]  He hasn't had like a major, other than Trump was his VP, he hasn't had like a big, like, whoa, that was bad moment.
[01:36:44.177 --> 01:36:44.698]  Yeah.
[01:36:45.098 --> 01:36:47.099]  So, well, the longer he goes, the worse it's going to get.
[01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:47.619]  It's getting bad.
[01:36:47.659 --> 01:36:48.360]  Let's go back.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.621]  Talk about the detail of it in public.
[01:36:54.412 --> 01:37:09.256]  And I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their investment in Russia, I mean, excuse me, in China.
[01:37:09.876 --> 01:37:13.377]  As long as China continues to have this indirect
[01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:18.889]  I can't swear that everyone agreed because not everyone got to talk about it.
[01:37:43.746 --> 01:37:47.349]  But we need a new industrial policy in the West.
[01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:55.757]  For example, we talked about how both the EU as well as NATO has to be able to begin to build their own industry capacity.
[01:37:55.797 --> 01:37:58.439]  And they have to be able to generate their own capacity to provide for weapons and the ability to
[01:38:06.664 --> 01:38:09.485]  Well, it came as a surprise to some of us.
[01:38:09.586 --> 01:38:12.027]  Oh yeah, you sold out the West and then you got double-crossed.
[01:38:12.047 --> 01:38:12.367]  You're surprised.
[01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:25.934]  How far behind in the West in terms of the ability to construct new material, new weaponry, new everything from vehicles to weapon systems.
[01:38:26.858 --> 01:38:34.822]  And so, one of the things that came out of this was, when I was in a meeting again with a number of my colleagues, my European colleagues, is what do we do to increase the capacity
[01:38:38.683 --> 01:38:39.563]  Yeah, this is just pathetic.
[01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:39.743]  Big boy.
[01:38:39.803 --> 01:38:41.524]  It's a big boy press conference.
[01:38:41.564 --> 01:38:44.905]  He's been answering this question for 10 minutes.
[01:38:44.925 --> 01:38:45.846]  They gotta hook him.
[01:38:45.946 --> 01:38:46.606]  He is 50 minutes in now.
[01:38:46.626 --> 01:38:47.366]  This is unwatchable.
[01:38:47.406 --> 01:38:48.927]  Just put the bikinis up.
[01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:09.860]  But we're going to be in a position where the West is going to become the industrial base for the ability to have all the defensive weapons that we need.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.701]  They're going to shift to a wartime economy, as we've seen.
[01:39:11.721 --> 01:39:19.828]  Mr. President, I'm not sure you answered on whether you would be ready to go deal with Putin and Xi two or three years from now.
[01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:22.931]  I'm ready to deal with them now and three years from now.
[01:39:23.772 --> 01:39:24.372]  Look, the
[01:39:30.094 --> 01:39:34.336]  Like I said, I'm dealing with shooting right now.
[01:39:35.276 --> 01:39:36.517]  And direct contact with him.
[01:39:37.717 --> 01:39:40.859]  I have no good reason to talk to Putin right now.
[01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:51.043]  There's not much that he is prepared to do in terms of accommodating any change in his behavior.
[01:39:51.424 --> 01:39:54.285]  But there isn't any world leader I'm not prepared to deal with.
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:40:02.075]  But I understand that a generic point is... He's the one rejecting talks with Putin.
[01:40:02.095 --> 01:40:04.237]  Putin's got a problem.
[01:40:04.277 --> 01:40:06.419]  First of all, in this war that he is supposedly of won,
[01:40:19.657 --> 01:40:30.600]  And by the way, I think, don't hold me to the exact number, but I think that Russia had 17.3% of Ukraine that they've conquered, now it's 17.4.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.921]  I mean, in terms of percentage of territory.
[01:40:35.241 --> 01:40:36.681]  They've not been very successful.
[01:40:37.401 --> 01:40:39.902]  They've caused horrible damage and loss of life.
[01:40:40.542 --> 01:40:42.543]  But they've also lost over 350,000 troops, military, killed or wounded.
[01:40:48.402 --> 01:40:56.444]  They have over a million people, particularly young people with technical capability, leaving Russia because they see no future there.
[01:40:57.064 --> 01:40:57.904]  They've got a problem.
[01:40:58.584 --> 01:41:10.667]  But what they do have control of is they are very good at controlling and running the public outcry that relates to how they use mechanisms to communicate with people.
[01:41:11.327 --> 01:41:13.307]  They lie like hell to the constituencies.
[01:41:13.868 --> 01:41:15.568]  They lie like hell about what's going on.
[01:41:16.654 --> 01:41:25.017]  And so the idea that we'll be able to fundamentally change Russia in the near term is not likely.
[01:41:25.077 --> 01:41:32.260]  But one thing for certain, when we allow Russia to succeed in Ukraine, they're not stopping in Ukraine.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:43.804]  I recommend, I know you know this because you've written about it, read Putin's speech after they moved in, what it was all about, in Kiev.
[01:41:45.134 --> 01:41:49.075]  It wasn't about just... Anyway, read what his objective is.
[01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:56.177]  So I think that I'm prepared to talk to any leader who wants to talk.
[01:41:56.837 --> 01:41:58.957]  Including if Putin called me and wanted to talk.
[01:41:59.617 --> 01:42:06.599]  Last time I talked to Putin was trying to get him to work on an arms control agreement related to nuclear weapons in space.
[01:42:07.779 --> 01:42:08.880]  That didn't go very far.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:14.441]  So my point is, I'm prepared to talk to anybody, but I don't see any inclination
[01:42:15.271 --> 01:42:18.773]  There is an inclination on the part of the Chinese to keep in contact with me.
[01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.154]  Because they're not sure where this all goes.
[01:42:21.534 --> 01:42:21.934]  They own you.
[01:42:21.954 --> 01:42:23.115]  And look what's happened in Asia.
[01:42:24.135 --> 01:42:28.577]  We have strengthened the Asian Pacific area more than anyone else has.
[01:42:29.397 --> 01:42:41.283]  We, you know, we just put together with... Today we had... I brought on, I asked our NATO allies that we bring on a group from the South Pacific.
[01:42:41.903 --> 01:42:44.384]  Australia, New Zealand, Japan.
[01:42:45.807 --> 01:42:46.407]  Australia.
[01:42:46.887 --> 01:42:49.148]  I already mentioned Australia.
[01:42:49.848 --> 01:42:54.470]  And I met twice now, I think with the 14 leaders of the Pacific Island Nations.
[01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:57.931]  And we've slowed down what's going on there.
[01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:00.511]  We've slowed down China's reach.
[01:43:00.531 --> 01:43:02.452]  Because there's a lot of work to do.
[01:43:02.632 --> 01:43:03.752]  This is a moving target.
[01:43:04.613 --> 01:43:06.013]  And I don't take it lightly.
[01:43:06.353 --> 01:43:07.213]  Definitely a moving target.
[01:43:07.974 --> 01:43:09.174]  Oh, he's going for another?
[01:43:09.194 --> 01:43:11.755]  Assam from NPR.
[01:43:11.915 --> 01:43:12.715]  He's going for another!
[01:43:15.605 --> 01:43:16.446]  Thank you Mr. President.
[01:43:16.706 --> 01:43:18.087]  Asma Khalid with NPR.
[01:43:18.648 --> 01:43:19.749]  I have two questions.
[01:43:19.889 --> 01:43:24.034]  Earlier you spoke about the ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas.
[01:43:24.654 --> 01:43:32.883]  We're now looking at 10 months of war and I'm curious if there's anything that you feel personally you wish you would have done differently over the course of the war.
[01:43:33.443 --> 01:43:37.345]  And secondly, if I may, I wanted to ask you about your presidential campaign.
[01:43:37.385 --> 01:43:48.711]  I remember covering your campaign in 2020, and there was a moment where you referred to yourself as a, quote, bridge candidacy, a transition to a younger generation of leaders.
[01:43:49.571 --> 01:43:52.333]  I want to understand what changed.
[01:43:53.593 --> 01:43:54.214]  Two things.
[01:43:54.254 --> 01:44:02.658]  Let's go back to when you talked about would I change anything that's happening with Israel and the Palestinians and the Palestinian movement.
[01:44:04.053 --> 01:44:11.900]  The answer is, as you recall, from the very beginning, I immediately... I went to Israel, but I also got immediate contact with Al-Sisi in Egypt.
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.002]  I met with the King of Jordan.
[01:44:15.783 --> 01:44:30.795]  I met with... I met with most of the Arab leaders to try to get a consensus going as to what had to be done to deal with getting more aid and food and medicine into the Gaza Strip.
[01:44:31.856 --> 01:44:39.677]  Yeah, isn't it ironic, this whole conversation about all these wars that broke out right after Biden got into office.
[01:44:40.097 --> 01:44:41.778]  Isn't that funny, Alex?
[01:44:41.858 --> 01:44:43.118]  No, but I mean, it's a train wreck.
[01:44:43.138 --> 01:44:48.879]  He looks retarded, but earlier he said that Zelensky is Putin.
[01:44:48.959 --> 01:44:49.719]  That was big.
[01:44:50.139 --> 01:44:52.220]  He said Trump is his vice president.
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:52.800]  That was big.
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:59.521]  But he's, I mean, this is a horrible failure, but compared to what it could have been, I say a win for Biden.
[01:45:00.541 --> 01:45:01.721]  Yeah, I probably agree.
[01:45:01.741 --> 01:45:03.722]  They put him on some really good stuff tonight.
[01:45:03.762 --> 01:45:09.344]  There's nothing yet from this that would be the end of his candidacy.
[01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:12.545]  Yeah, he just sounds like a retarded clown, but that's like, that's par for the course.
[01:45:13.385 --> 01:45:16.686]  The question is, though, in place by now, how long does he go?
[01:45:17.006 --> 01:45:18.667]  Because he is starting to degrade here.
[01:45:18.867 --> 01:45:27.050]  I mean, he already took, my time is already shot, so I'm surprised he's still on there, to be honest.
[01:45:28.948 --> 01:45:31.789]  That's a big boy.
[01:45:31.829 --> 01:45:35.630]  That's a big boy.
[01:45:36.391 --> 01:45:38.391]  That's your big boy.
[01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:41.112]  You just got a big boy.
[01:45:41.133 --> 01:45:44.434]  But he looks at the, he said, he looks down and goes, your question was?
[01:45:44.834 --> 01:45:47.095]  These are all pre, he's drilled these all day.
[01:45:47.275 --> 01:45:52.177]  Which makes me think, okay, you know, he had to mention Israel.
[01:45:52.317 --> 01:45:54.397]  So maybe this is the last question, right?
[01:45:54.437 --> 01:45:55.318]  I mean, I don't know what else.
[01:45:56.258 --> 01:45:57.319]  He's gonna have to address here.
[01:45:57.339 --> 01:46:01.263]  I mean, maybe the border?
[01:46:02.805 --> 01:46:04.446]  What, I said he'd go an hour?
[01:46:05.027 --> 01:46:06.048]  It's an hour and four minutes.
[01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:10.593]  You said he'd go 30 minutes, so... He went on, at what time did he go on?
[01:46:10.613 --> 01:46:10.973]  Like 6.30, guys?
[01:46:11.013 --> 01:46:11.974]  No, he went on about 6.15.
[01:46:14.636 --> 01:46:16.397]  So that's almost an hour.
[01:46:16.417 --> 01:46:17.817]  That's 55 minutes ago, right?
[01:46:17.837 --> 01:46:18.458]  You want about 6-10, 6-15?
[01:46:18.478 --> 01:46:19.478]  40 minutes only, okay.
[01:46:30.683 --> 01:46:32.104]  God, I feel like I've been here for a thousand years.
[01:46:32.144 --> 01:46:33.284]  Yeah, well, that'll happen.
[01:46:33.304 --> 01:46:38.927]  You ever have, like, a professor that was just, like, just the class felt like forever?
[01:46:39.007 --> 01:46:39.367]  Make it okay.
[01:46:39.387 --> 01:46:40.247]  Put bikinis on.
[01:46:40.287 --> 01:46:40.808]  God made them.
[01:46:40.828 --> 01:46:41.408]  It's God's work.
[01:46:41.468 --> 01:46:42.829]  Put it on.
[01:46:42.849 --> 01:46:45.370]  We'll make it okay.
[01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:47.871]  When is the bell gonna ring?
[01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:48.791]  Oh, okay.
[01:46:48.891 --> 01:46:49.692]  Everything's okay now.
[01:46:49.752 --> 01:46:50.532]  God, Jesus Christ.
[01:46:53.075 --> 01:46:54.518]  Turn him up, I can't barely hear him.
[01:46:54.538 --> 01:46:54.819]  Not bad.
[01:47:06.244 --> 01:47:09.185]  Don't think that's what you should be doing.
[01:47:10.226 --> 01:47:11.946]  We'll help you find the bad guys.
[01:47:12.507 --> 01:47:16.068]  They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage.
[01:47:29.493 --> 01:47:35.396]  But we remember what happened when you had the attack on Israel.
[01:47:35.976 --> 01:47:39.658]  From with rockets and ballistic missiles.
[01:47:39.758 --> 01:47:46.421]  I was able to unite the Arab nations as well as Europe.
[01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.841]  And nothing happened.
[01:47:48.242 --> 01:47:49.222]  Nothing got hurt.
[01:47:49.382 --> 01:47:53.424]  It sent an incredible lesson to what was going on from the Middle East.
[01:47:53.804 --> 01:47:55.385]  So there's a lot of things.
[01:47:56.145 --> 01:48:00.288]  In retrospect, I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do.
[01:48:00.988 --> 01:48:03.050]  But the bottom line is we have a chance now.
[01:48:03.730 --> 01:48:05.591]  It's time to end this war.
[01:48:05.611 --> 01:48:09.674]  It doesn't mean walk away from going after Sinwar and Hamas.
[01:48:10.094 --> 01:48:21.101]  And if you notice, you know better than most, there is a growing dissatisfaction on the West Bank from the Palestinians about Hamas.
[01:48:21.982 --> 01:48:23.443]  Hamas is not popular now.
[01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:25.817]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:25.837 --> 01:48:26.898]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:27.878]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:27.898 --> 01:48:28.778]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:28.798 --> 01:48:29.719]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:29.739 --> 01:48:30.739]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:30.759 --> 01:48:32.140]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.780]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.281]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:35.301 --> 01:48:36.361]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:36.401 --> 01:48:37.822]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:37.842 --> 01:48:38.882]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:38.902 --> 01:48:40.823]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:40.843 --> 01:48:42.463]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:42.483 --> 01:48:43.423]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:43.463 --> 01:48:44.684]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:44.704 --> 01:48:45.904]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:46.044 --> 01:48:47.385]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:47.405 --> 01:48:48.405]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:48.425 --> 01:48:49.325]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:49.345 --> 01:48:50.766]  Oh yeah, Israel is real popular in California.
[01:48:50.806 --> 01:48:51.186]  Oh yeah, Israel is
[01:48:52.927 --> 01:48:55.007]  Bridge candidacy in 2020.
[01:48:55.047 --> 01:49:04.169]  You referred to yourself as being a bridge candidate for a younger, fresher generation of Democratic leaders, and I wanted to know what changed.
[01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:16.832]  What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy, and domestic division.
[01:49:18.232 --> 01:49:21.273]  And I think, I won't put words in anybody's mouth,
[01:49:23.499 --> 01:49:35.911]  Most presidential historians give me credit for having accomplished more than most any president since Johnson and maybe before that to get major pieces of legislation passed.
[01:49:36.732 --> 01:49:39.134]  And what I realized was my
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.461]  So the big question is they're all against him.
[01:49:42.982 --> 01:49:44.102]  The system wants him out.
[01:49:44.142 --> 01:49:45.123]  How long can he hold on?
[01:49:45.163 --> 01:49:46.624]  I guess time's out.
[01:49:46.644 --> 01:49:47.585]  He will be the nominee.
[01:49:47.805 --> 01:49:48.786]  He is the nominee.
[01:49:49.066 --> 01:49:50.006]  It's just done.
[01:49:50.627 --> 01:49:53.509]  I think they still got two weeks.
[01:49:53.549 --> 01:49:55.290]  They still got two weeks if they want to remove him.
[01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:59.012]  I think what's going to be interesting is what is the narrative going to be after this?
[01:50:00.273 --> 01:50:08.038]  Is the media that's been covering for him going to talk about how fantastic he was and, oh, he's made his big recovery and that's the big story?
[01:50:08.559 --> 01:50:10.080]  Or are they going to be like, okay,
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:12.522]  This is about as bad as it gets.
[01:50:12.542 --> 01:50:16.906]  Thank you Mr. President.
[01:50:16.926 --> 01:50:20.470]  Many of your colleagues, Democrats in the Hill, are watching tonight.
[01:50:29.458 --> 01:50:31.619]  Am I using that way of speaking?
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:31.880]  Two weeks.
[01:50:56.274 --> 01:51:08.557]  I'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I lay fears by letting them see me out there.
[01:51:08.617 --> 01:51:15.078]  For the longest time it was, Biden's not prepared to sit with us unscripted.
[01:51:15.178 --> 01:51:16.979]  Biden's not prepared in any way.
[01:51:18.388 --> 01:51:32.567]  And so what I'm doing is what I've been doing I think we've done over 20 major events from Wisconsin to North Carolina to anyway to demonstrate that I'm going out in the areas where you think we can win
[01:51:33.468 --> 01:51:45.561]  I mean, he's in the biggest election fraud organization.
[01:51:46.021 --> 01:51:48.404]  See, that's the thing, is they're all cowards in the Democratic Party.
[01:51:48.424 --> 01:51:49.164]  They follow orders.
[01:51:49.805 --> 01:51:51.086]  So now they're up against their own enemy.
[01:51:51.627 --> 01:51:52.648]  Actually, I don't think he goes away.
[01:51:52.688 --> 01:51:53.489]  I think he stays in now.
[01:51:53.769 --> 01:51:55.550]  Headquarters, I forget exactly how many.
[01:51:55.590 --> 01:51:59.271]  I want to cite a number and then find out I'm off.
[01:51:59.351 --> 01:52:05.732]  But we have scores of headquarters in all the toss-up states.
[01:52:06.313 --> 01:52:07.113]  We're organized.
[01:52:07.193 --> 01:52:07.813]  We're moving.
[01:52:08.513 --> 01:52:11.774]  And that's awful hard to replace in the near term.
[01:52:12.594 --> 01:52:15.435]  And so... They can't stop now.
[01:52:15.575 --> 01:52:17.036]  It's really late in the game.
[01:52:17.096 --> 01:52:18.596]  I haven't seen him in a long time.
[01:52:18.616 --> 01:52:19.496]  You thought they replaced him.
[01:52:19.516 --> 01:52:20.117]  They planned to.
[01:52:20.137 --> 01:52:20.837]  He won't step down.
[01:52:20.857 --> 01:52:21.377]  It's too late.
[01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:23.335]  So he's going to rely on election fraud now.
[01:52:23.355 --> 01:52:28.336]  I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for a long time and I was chairman or ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
[01:52:29.437 --> 01:52:31.697]  I'm going to be going down to the Johnson Library.
[01:52:33.918 --> 01:52:50.642]  Anyway, I'm going to be going around making the case for the things that I think we have to finish and how we can't afford to lose what we've done or backslide on civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, that little button we have.
[01:52:52.438 --> 01:52:53.879]  Control guns, not girls.
[01:52:53.899 --> 01:53:07.567]  I mean, the idea that we're sitting around, and this is where Kamala's so good as well, we're sitting around, more children are killed by a bullet than any other cause of death.
[01:53:07.587 --> 01:53:09.068]  It's not true, it's fentanyl in your shots.
[01:53:09.088 --> 01:53:09.888]  In the United States of America.
[01:53:11.049 --> 01:53:11.909]  What the hell are we doing?
[01:53:12.029 --> 01:53:13.070]  Poison shots, fentanyl.
[01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:13.730]  What are we doing?
[01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:17.873]  We've got a candidate saying, promising, don't worry, I'm not going to do anything.
[01:53:18.942 --> 01:53:20.563]  I'm not going to do anything.
[01:53:20.983 --> 01:53:25.866]  You got a Supreme Court that is what you might call the most conservative court in American history.
[01:53:27.107 --> 01:53:28.027]  This is ridiculous.
[01:53:28.828 --> 01:53:30.789]  There's so much we can do still.
[01:53:30.809 --> 01:53:33.750]  And I'm determined to get it done.
[01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:34.931]  It's about freedom.
[01:53:34.951 --> 01:53:35.751]  I'll end this.
[01:53:35.791 --> 01:53:36.712]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:53:37.172 --> 01:53:39.073]  Haley has to come up too.
[01:53:39.113 --> 01:53:39.734]  He's fading fast.
[01:53:39.794 --> 01:53:40.534]  He's ready to go.
[01:53:47.924 --> 01:53:51.745]  The speech on democracy in Philadelphia at Independence Hall.
[01:53:53.385 --> 01:53:55.486]  And I'm not being critical, just observing.
[01:53:56.386 --> 01:53:58.486]  The bulk of the press, what the hell are you talking about that for?
[01:53:59.506 --> 01:53:59.907]  Democracy.
[01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:01.387]  And you did.
[01:54:01.947 --> 01:54:03.187]  Democracy is not an issue.
[01:54:03.967 --> 01:54:05.088]  Democracy is not an issue.
[01:54:06.068 --> 01:54:09.889]  Except the polling data showed 60% of the people knew I was right, thought I was right.
[01:54:11.249 --> 01:54:13.669]  I'm not asking you a question, you don't have to answer, obviously.
[01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:16.190]  But do you think our democracy is under siege?
[01:54:17.262 --> 01:54:18.063]  Based on this court?
[01:54:18.103 --> 01:54:21.104]  Do you think democracy under siege is based on Project 2025?
[01:54:21.244 --> 01:54:22.905]  Arresting people?
[01:54:23.185 --> 01:54:25.407]  They may just remove Biden, the guy everybody voted for.
[01:54:25.627 --> 01:54:26.808]  Do away with the civil service?
[01:54:27.528 --> 01:54:28.969]  Eliminate his Department of Education?
[01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.871]  By the way, none of that has to do with democracy.
[01:54:31.911 --> 01:54:33.171]  We've never been here before.
[01:54:33.251 --> 01:54:34.112]  That's bureaucracy.
[01:54:34.232 --> 01:54:38.014]  And that's the other reason why I didn't, you say, hand off to another generation.
[01:54:38.935 --> 01:54:40.175]  I've got to finish this job.
[01:54:41.136 --> 01:54:42.337]  I've got to finish this job.
[01:54:43.097 --> 01:54:44.538]  Because there's so much at stake.
[01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.869]  See, this is strange.
[01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:48.931]  Is he saying that I'm here to finish America?
[01:54:48.991 --> 01:54:50.171]  Is that what he's saying?
[01:54:50.272 --> 01:54:55.775]  ...about the question of health exams, and you said you take the cognitive test every day in this job.
[01:54:56.956 --> 01:55:00.278]  Are you open to taking another physical or test before the election?
[01:55:00.778 --> 01:55:03.800]  Governor Whitmer of Michigan, for instance, said it wouldn't hurt to take a test.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.441]  Well, look, two things.
[01:55:07.562 --> 01:55:09.543]  One, I've taken three
[01:55:11.778 --> 01:55:19.441]  Significant and intense neurological exams by a neurologist.
[01:55:19.601 --> 01:55:20.021]  Perfect!
[01:55:20.762 --> 01:55:22.442]  In these cases, we use the Category.
[01:55:23.523 --> 01:55:24.823]  And they say I'm in good shape.
[01:55:25.464 --> 01:55:25.664]  Okay?
[01:55:26.444 --> 01:55:32.626]  Although I do have a little problem with my left foot because it's not as sensitive because I broke my foot and didn't wear the boot.
[01:55:35.067 --> 01:55:35.928]  But I'm good.
[01:55:37.488 --> 01:55:38.909]  I'm tested every single day.
[01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:42.662]  Well, my neurological capacity to do decisions I make every day.
[01:55:43.683 --> 01:55:45.825]  You talk to my staff, all of you talk to my staff.
[01:55:46.526 --> 01:55:48.208]  Sometimes my staff talks a lot.
[01:55:49.349 --> 01:55:58.358]  But the fact of the matter is, I don't think you have them telling you that all the major ideas we've undertaken haven't been initiated by me.
[01:55:58.378 --> 01:56:01.361]  I remember when the staff said, I need to go to South Korea.
[01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:03.943]  What are you doing?
[01:56:04.404 --> 01:56:14.229]  I'm going to get Japan and Korea back together again after essentially having hostilities toward one another since the end of World War II.
[01:56:14.269 --> 01:56:16.930]  I'm going to see if we can expand it.
[01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:20.712]  You know, the only thing AIDS does is help you.
[01:56:20.792 --> 01:56:22.893]  It creates a little bit of wisdom.
[01:56:22.933 --> 01:56:23.533]  Let's be honest.
[01:56:27.037 --> 01:56:30.398]  And so, the point I'm making is, I think if he could, that, I is, I need another exam, by the way.
[01:56:30.418 --> 01:56:32.458]  I've, I've laid every bit of the work out.
[01:56:32.499 --> 01:56:34.039]  And, and, and it's, and it's for you.
[01:56:34.119 --> 01:56:36.380]  I'm gonna ask Trump for you this, okay?
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.020]  And I, I laid it all out.
[01:56:54.267 --> 01:56:56.629]  And every single day I'm surrounded by good docs.
[01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:05.498]  If they think it's a problem, I promise you, or if they don't think it's a problem, they think I should have a neurologic exam again, I'll do it.
[01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:07.740]  But no one's suggesting that to me now.
[01:57:08.501 --> 01:57:09.602]  And I'll ask you another question.
[01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:13.286]  No matter what I did, no one's going to be satisfied.
[01:57:14.309 --> 01:57:15.290]  Did you have 7 docs?
[01:57:15.311 --> 01:57:16.212]  Did you have 2?
[01:57:16.252 --> 01:57:17.353]  How many times have you?
[01:57:17.514 --> 01:57:23.381]  So, I am not opposed if my doctors tell me I should have another neurological exam.
[01:57:23.402 --> 01:57:23.622]  I do.
[01:57:23.642 --> 01:57:24.463]  But that's where I am.
[01:57:32.642 --> 01:57:35.824]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:57:35.844 --> 01:57:40.687]  You said you're making decisions on a day-to-day basis when it comes to support for Ukraine.
[01:57:40.767 --> 01:57:48.832]  Does that mean you have not closed the door on further considering lifting restrictions for U.S.-made weapons inside Russia?
[01:57:48.932 --> 01:57:54.035]  And if I may, your convention is coming up where your delegates are pledged to make you the official nominee.
[01:57:54.755 --> 01:57:57.857]  If they have second thoughts, are they free to vote their conscience?
[01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:03.134]  Obviously, they're free to do whatever they want, but I get overwhelming support.
[01:58:04.155 --> 01:58:06.097]  Overwhelming support.
[01:58:06.857 --> 01:58:09.599]  I won, I forget how many votes I won in the primary.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.060]  Overwhelming.
[01:58:12.161 --> 01:58:18.526]  And so tomorrow, if all of a sudden I show up at the convention and everybody says we want somebody else, that's the democratic process.
[01:58:22.216 --> 01:58:24.137]  Yeah, that's a democratic process.
[01:58:24.837 --> 01:58:25.137]  Sure.
[01:58:25.157 --> 01:58:26.797]  You know, who cares what the people vote for?
[01:58:26.817 --> 01:58:28.978]  We replaced people at the convention.
[01:58:29.078 --> 01:58:29.638]  Yeah.
[01:58:31.719 --> 01:58:33.319]  I served in the Senate a long time.
[01:58:33.519 --> 01:58:33.919]  He's done.
[01:58:33.939 --> 01:58:36.840]  He's making deals to step down to the convention.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:37.660]  I think that's what's up.
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.281]  We just heard that.
[01:58:39.301 --> 01:58:41.001]  Candidates running for local office.
[01:58:42.442 --> 01:58:45.642]  And whether they think Topathy can help them or not.
[01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:50.744]  In my state of Delaware, which was a very
[01:58:52.462 --> 01:58:53.342]  At least a purple.
[01:58:53.823 --> 01:58:55.724]  It was a red state when I started.
[01:58:56.605 --> 01:59:02.269]  In terms of we now talk red and blue.
[01:59:04.111 --> 01:59:09.055]  I don't recall most of the Democratic presidents winning my state when I was a candidate.
[01:59:10.135 --> 01:59:12.978]  The truth of the matter is I understand the self-interest of a candidate.
[01:59:13.818 --> 01:59:20.203]  If they think that, you know, running with Biden at the top is going to hurt them, then they're going to run away.
[01:59:20.223 --> 01:59:20.864]  I get it.
[01:59:21.818 --> 01:59:26.761]  But so far, go and look at the polling data in their states.
[01:59:27.882 --> 01:59:36.547]  Look at the in-depth, and by the way, I think you'd all acknowledge, and you're all experts, I'm not being solicitous about the president, you're experts on this stuff.
[01:59:38.949 --> 01:59:41.730]  How accurate does anybody think the polls are these days?
[01:59:43.071 --> 01:59:49.115]  I can give you a series of polls where you have likely voters, me versus Trump, where I win all the time.
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:53.501]  When the unlikely voters vote, he wins sometimes.
[01:59:54.102 --> 02:00:00.064]  The bottom line is all the polling data right now, which I think is premature because the campaign really hasn't even started.
[02:00:00.084 --> 02:00:01.965]  He has like 50 people in this.
[02:00:01.985 --> 02:00:03.305]  His campaign hasn't started Alex.
[02:00:03.606 --> 02:00:07.527]  Most of the time it doesn't start until after September, after Labor Day.
[02:00:08.808 --> 02:00:10.949]  So, a lot can happen.
[02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:16.731]  But I think I'm the best qualified, I know, I believe I'm the best qualified to govern.
[02:00:18.104 --> 02:00:19.847]  And I think I'm the best qualified to win.
[02:00:21.389 --> 02:00:23.332]  But there are other people who could beat Trump, too.
[02:00:24.154 --> 02:00:26.617]  But it's awful to start from scratch.
[02:00:27.659 --> 02:00:31.425]  And, you know, we talk about, you know, money raises.
[02:00:31.465 --> 02:00:32.006]  We're not doing bad.
[02:00:33.294 --> 02:00:35.775]  We got about $220 million in the bank.
[02:00:36.515 --> 02:00:38.076]  It wasn't as bad as it could have been.
[02:00:38.096 --> 02:00:38.836]  Oh, now he's admitting.
[02:00:38.856 --> 02:00:39.616]  You're getting rid of me.
[02:00:39.636 --> 02:00:40.177]  I got control of money.
[02:00:40.197 --> 02:00:41.317]  Do you want to follow up on any of that?
[02:00:41.677 --> 02:00:42.457]  Can you just ask me?
[02:00:42.898 --> 02:00:43.358]  He's done.
[02:00:46.559 --> 02:00:50.420]  You earlier explained confidence in your Vice President.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:50.740]  Yes.
[02:00:50.941 --> 02:00:59.964]  If your team came back and showed you data that she would fare better against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race?
[02:01:00.644 --> 02:01:04.087]  Your favorite president, his vice president nominee.
[02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:07.010]  Me.
[02:01:08.431 --> 02:01:09.432]  No one's saying that.
[02:01:10.233 --> 02:01:12.395]  No poll says that.
[02:01:12.435 --> 02:01:13.275]  He's done.
[02:01:13.375 --> 02:01:14.997]  He's trying to get out.
[02:01:15.037 --> 02:01:16.798]  He's trying to bail.
[02:01:16.838 --> 02:01:17.639]  Everyone knows it.
[02:01:17.659 --> 02:01:18.420]  Thanks, everybody.
[02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:25.826]  Let's see how this goes.
[02:01:25.846 --> 02:01:26.427]  This concludes
[02:01:26.687 --> 02:01:29.688]  Respectfully, earlier you misspoke in your opening answer.
[02:01:29.728 --> 02:01:33.250]  You referred to Vice President Harris as Vice President Trump.
[02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:38.212]  Right now, Donald Trump is using that to mock your age and your memory.
[02:01:38.272 --> 02:01:39.052]  Yes, it's a mockery.
[02:01:39.072 --> 02:01:41.393]  How do you combat that criticism from tonight?
[02:01:42.033 --> 02:01:43.194]  They turned the mic off.
[02:01:43.234 --> 02:01:44.594]  Listen to him.
[02:01:44.614 --> 02:01:46.235]  This concludes tonight's press conference.
[02:01:46.355 --> 02:01:47.175]  Thank you, everybody.
[02:01:47.435 --> 02:01:48.536]  Thanks, everyone.
[02:01:52.426 --> 02:02:02.590]  It's so great that whether I win or lose, I'm going to be the next president of the United States, thanks to Joe Biden making me his vice president.
[02:02:02.610 --> 02:02:03.470]  We all know he won't make it.
[02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:05.911]  It's going to be Donald Trump 2024.
[02:02:09.292 --> 02:02:10.753]  So closing this down, Owen.
[02:02:13.271 --> 02:02:13.892]  I'm gonna be honest.
[02:02:15.074 --> 02:02:15.735]  It was terrible.
[02:02:15.755 --> 02:02:17.818]  He's out of his mind, but it could have been a lot worse.
[02:02:17.958 --> 02:02:21.544]  I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, Biden did a 5 here.
[02:02:22.225 --> 02:02:22.685]  He passed.
[02:02:23.567 --> 02:02:24.027]  He passed.
[02:02:24.247 --> 02:02:24.868]  He got a passing grade.
[02:02:24.888 --> 02:02:25.648]  He pulled it all together.
[02:02:25.909 --> 02:02:31.152]  It was horrible, it was ridiculous, he got a bunch of faux pas, a bunch of gaps, but it could have been much worse.
[02:02:31.352 --> 02:02:33.353]  No, I do think he gets a passing grade.
[02:02:34.254 --> 02:02:36.935]  It really just depends on, I think, the media response to it now.
[02:02:37.556 --> 02:02:44.080]  What twist they try to put on it, or how they try to put... Is it going to be makeup on a pig, or is it going to be like, okay, he's done?
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.764]  I think, though, if we talk about the American people, if they're watching that, I think what really sticks out
[02:02:50.564 --> 02:02:54.345]  Not even when he flummoxed and says Trump is the vice president or any of that.
[02:02:55.126 --> 02:02:58.027]  Really, he just comes off as so weak.
[02:02:58.527 --> 02:03:01.388]  I mean, he just comes off as really weak and feeble.
[02:03:01.468 --> 02:03:04.769]  I think that's what resonates with the American people, just the weakness he presents.
[02:03:05.269 --> 02:03:05.910]  No, I agree.
[02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.710]  So what happens now?
[02:03:07.662 --> 02:03:09.643]  Like I said, I just want to see, let's see what the media does.
[02:03:09.723 --> 02:03:10.863]  Does the media twist this?
[02:03:11.003 --> 02:03:11.863]  Do they prop him up?
[02:03:12.003 --> 02:03:14.064]  Or do they say, this guy's shot?
[02:03:14.344 --> 02:03:15.444]  They got two weeks, Alex.
[02:03:15.684 --> 02:03:16.264]  He even said it.
[02:03:16.284 --> 02:03:17.245]  He was like, I had two weeks.
[02:03:17.265 --> 02:03:18.925]  He's like, well, they got two weeks if you want to replace me.
[02:03:18.945 --> 02:03:20.926]  Well, the dives are out, so I think they attacked.
[02:03:23.226 --> 02:03:23.606]  We'll see.
[02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:25.307]  That's going to be, that's going to be the story now.
[02:03:25.847 --> 02:03:27.888]  What's, um... Well, let's be honest.
[02:03:27.928 --> 02:03:29.308]  He rallied here at the end.
[02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.136]  What is the Drudge Report headline right now?
[02:03:32.176 --> 02:03:34.097]  Oh, they're saying Jill and Joe are now going live?
[02:03:34.117 --> 02:03:35.497]  He's coming back?
[02:03:36.137 --> 02:03:38.358]  Jill is probably doing something, I'm sure.
[02:03:40.298 --> 02:03:40.979]  Jill Biden?
[02:03:43.639 --> 02:03:43.959]  Alright.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.480]  Well, roll the message from Jill.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:47.860]  Go ahead.
[02:03:50.701 --> 02:03:52.381]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[02:03:52.441 --> 02:03:54.782]  You answered every question.
[02:03:59.096 --> 02:04:02.739]  Let me ask the crowd, what did Trump do?
[02:04:03.199 --> 02:04:05.181]  Why?
[02:04:06.742 --> 02:04:07.082]  Big boy.
[02:04:08.003 --> 02:04:09.184]  We make jokes about this.
[02:04:10.324 --> 02:04:12.266]  He said Zelensky was Putin today.
[02:04:12.826 --> 02:04:14.207]  And he said Harris was Trump.
[02:04:15.648 --> 02:04:18.350]  Yeah.
[02:04:18.370 --> 02:04:19.651]  That's, you know, could have been worse.
[02:04:22.033 --> 02:04:22.894]  So what happens next?
[02:04:24.474 --> 02:04:24.874]  I don't know.
[02:04:25.074 --> 02:04:25.814]  I really don't know.
[02:04:26.615 --> 02:04:31.076]  If the Democrats have decided they're going to replace him, then we'll know by the end of the night.
[02:04:31.696 --> 02:04:39.398]  If they're still going to let the time run out in the next two weeks and give him a shot, then we'll see them kind of protecting him and propping him up.
[02:04:40.258 --> 02:04:43.459]  Well, I want to thank the crew for working so many hours today.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.864]  And Harrison Smith will be on at 8 a.m.
[02:04:46.884 --> 02:04:47.344]  tomorrow.
[02:04:47.805 --> 02:04:49.387]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:49.407 --> 02:04:50.269]  I'll be on 11 a.m.
[02:04:50.289 --> 02:04:52.913]  Central and we'll be back with Owen at 3 p.m.
[02:04:53.393 --> 02:04:54.375]  Central with the War Room.
[02:04:54.916 --> 02:04:57.780]  But great job crew with all the coverage and
[02:04:59.226 --> 02:05:00.267]  Biden did better than I thought he'd do.
[02:05:00.287 --> 02:05:07.632]  He did a terrible job, but compared to what I thought he would do, I have to say that this is a spectacular failure by the deep state.
[02:05:07.652 --> 02:05:09.173]  So we appreciate you all.
[02:05:09.233 --> 02:05:12.095]  DrJonesDadRolls.com and FullRestore.com.

[02:05:17.238 --> 02:05:17.879]  Owen, take us out.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:24.965]  All right, well, the big story right now in the media is Biden called Harris Trump.
[02:05:25.185 --> 02:05:26.467]  We'll see what they have to say next.
[02:05:26.627 --> 02:05:28.328]  We'll see you live tomorrow.
[02:07:12.048 --> 02:07:12.651]  I don't know.
[02:07:21.854 --> 02:07:24.416]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[02:07:25.016 --> 02:07:25.737]  Everybody knows it.
