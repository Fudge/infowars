[00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.140]  Now, I'm going to state a fact, and then I'm going to lay it out.
[00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.440]  The U.S. government, secretly by 65, had certified that they had total control of hurricanes.
[00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.739]  By 67, the Pentagon confirmed it and certified it.
[00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:30.339]  And in 69, the program was taken from Ben Livingston, who we're going to show you clubs of, that I interviewed first.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560]  He's been on Fox News, you name it.
[00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.140]  Running weather operations in World War II at the end, right through Vietnam and being a consultant into his 90s for the Pentagon.
[00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.479]  He led squadrons in Operation Storm Fury controlling hurricanes and Operation Popeye in Vietnam.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.100]  One week after he went back to Lubbock from flying here with his wife to be interviewed by me, I called him and he said, I can't talk to you.
[00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.179]  Got a visit from high up U.S. government.
[00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.939]  And even though it's classified, they told me not to talk to you or anybody else anymore.
[00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.359]  He did a Fox interview before he got that visit.
[00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.280]  So I interviewed him first. Fox interviewed him a few days later.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.939]  And then never talked to again.
[00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.519]  And he's in the documents that were declassified as the commander of it.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.620]  He was the first person to ever fly into a typhoon in 1945.
[00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.450]  And cloud seeded.
[00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.930]  I'm going to play excerpts of that and more.
[00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:40.629]  I'm going to show you the U.N. documents, the U.S. government documents, the Storm Fury documents that are on the government website,.gov, U.S. gov.
[00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:50.049]  I'm going to show you the CIA director admitting it, Bill Gates admitting it, all of it.
[00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.010]  Now, here's the key, and I'll go through all the evidence.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:06.659]  It is a fact the U.S. government can create hurricanes, kill hurricanes, make them bigger, make them smaller, make them turn left, make them turn right, make them stop, make them, they can control them like a joystick.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.120]  And we have the confirmed flights by the Department of Energy who's over this.
[00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.860]  NOAA just monitors the weather.
[00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.000]  Department of Energy with the Pentagon runs the programs.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.280]  I'll show you all the documents. Since the 40s.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.340]  And they're in control.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.560]  Whether they're messing with it or not, they could kill it.
[00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.759]  And the power to kill something is the power to control it.
[00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.939]  Now, obviously, we have the flights.
[00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.939]  We show the planes going in, steering it.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.080]  You see the flights move.
[00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.099]  They're controlling it. And that's with the old technology.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.280]  Then they've got the lasers.
[00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.099]  Then they've got the ground radar they can ionize it with.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780]  And they got all sorts of ships out there with these high-powered radar control systems.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.759]  You can pull up, you know, Associated Press.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.680]  Dubai making the desert green with Doppler radar.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.400]  China making it rain with Doppler radar.
[00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.939]  Trillion-watt lasers.
[00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.060]  So, the first thing I want to play, and you ought to go to the C-SPAN archives and watch the whole thing.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.879]  This is 1995 Robert Fletcher.
[00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.270]  Who did a great job coalescing the public documents then and warning the public and state legislatures.
[00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.669]  They were demonizing him in Congress.
[00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.909]  They were speechless when he brought up the U.S. Senate report that I have a copy of here from decades before.
[00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:41.490]  I also have the head of the Defense Department, William Cohen, in 1997 in a briefing at the Pentagon that was public picked up by AP and Reuters admitting the U.S. government controls the weather and has weather weapons and earthquake weapons.
[00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.250]  You want to see that? We got that.
[00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:49.099]  Got too much evidence. But they talk to you like your children and say this stuff doesn't exist.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.340]  Alright, here is Robert Fletcher in front of Congress.
[00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:01.509]  Another question on the interview with the Los Angeles Times on April 21st.
[00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:16.529]  You told the Associated Press that the American government has created weather-tampering techniques so that the New World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.870]  Would you explain what you were trying to say?
[00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.329]  Well, what I was trying to say is exactly what I said.
[00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:25.550]  There is weather control techniques.
[00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.089]  We have a complete package on that, which I did not bring, but I certainly will see to it that it is brought in for the record.
[00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.009]  Number one, the entire patents on the equipment.
[00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:45.029]  Number two, Senator Claiborne Pell's complete statement and story of his own that not only does it exist, that we even utilize it as far back as the Vietnam War.
[00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.910]  You might want to touch base with Senator Perry.
[00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.269]  That's all right, but I just want to repeat before we turn to...
[00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.209]  So yes, but we do have all that information.
[00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.610]  You're saying the government has created weather-tampering techniques so that the, quote, new world order...
[00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.620]  We'll be able to starve millions of Americans.
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.060]  Worldwide. Millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:06.980]  Yes, sir. And that's my belief.
[00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:14.660]  As bizarre as that sounds, when if somebody had told me that that equipment even existed 10 years ago, I would have thought they were nuts, sir.
[00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.839]  And at this point in time, we have all the documents to prove it.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.009]  And if you think that 85 Tornadoes takes place in the middle of our growing area by simultaneous accident.
[00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.889]  I'm sorry. With the equipment that's already set up internationally, and as bizarre as that is, it is proven and documented.
[00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.550]  We will supply you with those documents.
[00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:47.420]  As bizarre as that is, I would say that weather wars, and this is quoting actually Senator Claiborne Pell himself, That they are the greatest weapon ever created in the world, and that's the senator's own statement.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.899]  So yes, I do stand on that.
[00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.259]  Thank you, Mr. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr.
[00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:58.480]  Chairman. And of course, he then delivered to them, as he did on my show back then in studio, and as he did to the legislatures, huge binders of all the documents.
[00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.360]  That's how I learned about all this.
[00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:14.240]  When I was first getting on air in 1994-95, Fletcher came to town, came on my Access TV show, came on my local radio show, and he gave me huge binders that are somewhere, but I've got the documents now because the internet didn't have all these on it then.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.040]  He got it from the U.S. archives.
[00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.920]  He spent a year in D.C. digging them all out.
[00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.129]  So we stand on his shoulders.
[00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:23.550]  I had Fletcher on a few years ago.
[00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.610]  I think he's still alive. I want to get him on.
[00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.029]  He actually worked for the CIA on record.
[00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:43.009]  The Air Force and the Navy, in consultation with Standard Research Institute, certified all this in the mid-60s, and then it got made secret and given to another division in 67 and 69 that they,
[00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:44.550]  quote, had full control of hurricanes.
[00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.290]  Could create them, could steer them, could kill them.
[00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.920]  And there is Report to Congress Need for a National Weather Modification Research Program, 1974.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.560]  Well, they already had it. And there was a Nobel Prize won in 92 that Bill Gates has now picked up on.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.459]  He bought the company to, quote, spray the atmosphere to, quote, give the Earth sunscreen to stop global warming.
[00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:20.199]  They just add nuclei, barium salts, limited oxide, Different forms of silver oxide into the fuel than the jet engines put out the nuclei-causing particles.
[00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.139]  And they go, oh, that's just ice crystals.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.839]  Well, I remember before the mid-'90s, a plane would fly by high, and you'd see the crystals form, then it would disappear in a minute.
[00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.019]  Remember? As a kid, you'd watch it disappear if you're old enough.
[00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:38.060]  And you'll see jets right by another jet that's chemtrailing, and its trails are staying, and a jet right by it's not leaving trails.
[00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.819]  So they talk to us like we're dumb.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.040]  It's called geoengineering.
[00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.889]  High-altitude aerosol campaigns.
[00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:46.529]  There's congressional hearings.
[00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:51.790]  Go watch it. So let's go to SP1. Here's Livingston talking about some of the history.
[00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:57.970]  I'm interviewing him. And then we'll go to another clip where he talks about it being certified by the U.S. government.
[00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:05.850]  Here it is. I'm the first person to ever see the cloud with the intention to call it to do military damage.
[00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.550]  I know I can say that, and I did it several times.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.560]  Show me what these clouds are we're looking at.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:22.899]  Well, these clouds were located up in the southern part of North Vietnam and we needed to make rain down on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Highway 1.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.399]  But there weren't any real clouds around.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:44.559]  There were a number, this was the end of the monsoon season, but there were a number of these small clouds that reached, barely reached the freezing level, and by putting a small amount of silver iodide in there,
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.940]  we got them to collect and start to build.
[00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:56.700]  And as they built, we just worked on the largest tower in the group until in a very short time.
[00:08:57.289 --> 00:08:59.169]  We had clouds that were...
[00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.929]  You told me this cloud got 14 inches of...
[00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:04.230]  Well, this cloud, of course, this is all the same cloud.
[00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:15.730]  I was assigned to the Typhoon Squadron in Guam, where I served for three years as a flight meteorologist and meteorological engineer.
[00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.850]  They sent me to the Hurricane Hunter Squadron in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.720]  That squadron, of course, had just become involved in Project StormFury.
[00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:40.039]  So when I reported to that duty station as a meteorological engineer, I was immediately designated the military member of the StormFury Advisory Board.
[00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:56.659]  We were doing quite a lot of testing work out over the test range at China Lake, California, where we dropped cloud seeding flares or silver iodide generators into clouds or just wherever we wanted to to see what the reaction was.
[00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:06.620]  And it was there when I learned for sure that you could really change a cloud by the amount of silver iodide you put in it and where you put it.
[00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:15.450]  This cloud here, from the time it started raining until it quit, it put out a little over 14 inches of precipitation.
[00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.330]  What did that do to the North Vietnamese?
[00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:26.649]  Well, it just washed all the roads out, and there was a bridge attached to a mountain that bombed and could not get rid of it.
[00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:31.529]  This heavy rain washing down that river took that bridge out.
[00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.710]  Okay, let's go to Lemmingson talking about after he...
[00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.110]  Well, he's still in Vietnam, but coming back and then running projects and then totally controlling hurricanes.
[00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:53.990]  Here it is. The results from the Hurricane Debbie experiment seemed so positive that many individuals believe the project should go operational, seeding major hurricanes that threaten land.
[00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:07.909]  A team of scientists at Stanford Research Institute at Stanford University did a decision analysis on all past seeding events, including the That's the 1961 and 1963 experiments.
[00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:20.370]  Dr. James Madison of that group, reflecting their views, stated, we claim they should consider seeding now if a big hurricane comes straight from Miami.
[00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:33.809]  These scientists said the government may have to accept responsibility for not seeding and thereby exposing the public to higher probabilities of severe storm damage and possible higher death tolls.
[00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.009]  Now, it goes on, and he says they can control the hurricanes.
[00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:41.149]  I'm going to show you all the documents. But the point is this.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.720]  They're blocking the aid.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.340]  They're hiding the $9 billion or $7 billion, it turned out, they just had.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.779]  They gave a billion to the illegals.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.080]  The Democrats, like Axelrod, are bragging it's helping them keep the conservative areas from voting.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.279]  They have the motive. They're attacking every form of our country, our energy, our dollar.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.000]  They want to collapse us under Cloward and Piven to control us.
[00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.080]  So they have the history, the motive, all of it.
[00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:12.000]  And the CIA director in a clip I'm about to play said the same thing in 2008.
[00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:21.100]  15. On C-SPAN. He said, well, we can't really tell anybody about this because of the legal issues, but we're doing it.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.659]  So they just keep it secret.
[00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:31.480]  Then we have the aircraft going in, and I have countless of these videos, by meteorologists, by scientists, and by lay folks who see the planes take off.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.340]  They go in and do the classic weather modification maneuvers.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.519]  And the damn storms get stronger.
[00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:40.259]  They could go in and knock the damn things down and dump it in the ocean.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.679]  But they don't. They use the excuse of liability.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.220]  But they are controlling. And that's the whole history of this corrupt government.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.519]  And other governments are doing it.
[00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.440]  And there's a UN treaty, 77 and 78.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.419]  Two treaties against it. I'll show you those.
[00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:58.200]  That CIA director talks about those treaties in a moment.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.100]  But first, let's play one of the clips.
[00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:01.679]  And I looked this up myself. It's accurate.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.220]  They're not even hiding these Department of Energy aircraft.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.379]  Working with the Pentagon, the Navy, and the Air Force doing this.
[00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:11.149]  Here's a clip. I'm not saying that the Hurricane Helene.
[00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.649]  What I am saying is that the government has been manipulating the weather since 1947.
[00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.090]  What first caught my attention with Helene was the shift in the storm's projected path.
[00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.769]  One day, it looked like it would hit my town.
[00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:25.789]  The next day, it had shifted east.
[00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:29.669]  I then noticed an odd flight path of NOAA 42.
[00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.409]  The aircraft being flown?
[00:13:31.789 --> 00:13:44.769]  A Lockheed Martin Orion P3. This prompted me to look at previous uses for the P3, where I discovered that they were used in the 1960s to manipulate Hurricane Camille in a, quote, weather war on Cuba.
[00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:53.250]  Now I know this sounds out there, but as we begin to see more and more the terrible things our government has done in the past, is it really so far-fetched?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.879]  Here are the projections from the 23rd of September.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.120]  A large spread traveling the Alabama-Georgia line and ending up in Illinois.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.659]  On the 24th, projections shift slightly east and the storm is projected to finish in Indiana.
[00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:17.200]  On the morning of the 25th, the path shifts back west and shows to be finishing in western Kentucky.
[00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:23.039]  That evening, a P3 conducts a six-hour operation inside the developing storm.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:32.639]  The next morning, on the 26th, the path shows to have shifted slightly east again, now finishing in northwestern Tennessee.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:46.580]  The evening of the 26th, the same P3 conducts operations throughout Hurricane Helene as it makes landfall, and the storm's actual path shifts further east, finishing in northeastern Tennessee.
[00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.529]  What would the government's motivations possibly be to modify a storm?
[00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:53.129]  That I don't know.
[00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.450]  But I do believe that if we can maintain our republic long enough, time will eventually tell.
[00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:00.809]  And this just broke.
[00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:08.230]  Congress is now confirming that Hurricane Helena did have U.S. government weather weapon planes in it.
[00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.350]  Now, we already have the tracks.
[00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.690]  We already have the tail numbers.
[00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.389]  They don't even have this crap.
[00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.830]  It just broke. It's on Infowars.com.
[00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:24.740]  Breaking. Lawmakers briefed on weather modification tech conclude Hurricane Helena was DOD-linked weather weapon deployed against American people.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.240]  How does this hurricane's path differ from others that we've seen?
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:40.740]  I've already had a lot of people call me from the Asheville area, talk specifically about the horrendous damage, and many of them pointed out that that is not Hurricane Alley, per se.
[00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:43.539]  It's not an area that normally attracts storms.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.600]  Can you help us understand this?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.740]  Well, the bottom line is it was directed there as the transmission recordings clearly show.
[00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:56.940]  They kept that moisture corralled there to deluge in the same location.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:07.960]  So again, these are patented technologies and the fact that we have the entire so-called meteorological community denying that this is going on to protect their paychecks and pensions is absolutely criminal at this point.
[00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:25.470]  We know we have private defense contractors that are neck deep in the patents that manipulate these storms, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, We know those two in particular do the weather modeling for the nation's weathermen, National Weather Service and NOAA. Again, both agencies have an illegal federal gag order on them.
[00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.529]  So at this point, this is an emperor has no clothes moment.
[00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:36.789]  That's the best description I can give for something that is so blatantly obvious and inarguable can only be considered weather warfare at this point.
[00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.389]  And the fact that, again, the so-called science community is denying this manipulation is criminal.
[00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.389]  It's absolutely criminal, Colonel McGregor.
[00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:45.110]  Let me explain something to you.
[00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:48.159]  He brings in the weather mod whistleblowers.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.820]  It never makes the news.
[00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:52.019]  Okay, legislatures, federal, you name it.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.259]  You hear what he just said? Hurricanes always get weaker over land.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.200]  Now they get stronger.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.600]  They are manipulating them.
[00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:04.460]  We have the flight pass. Let's finish up and then go to Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:07.890]  Here it is. Because that's how they manipulate these storms.
[00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:14.390]  And again, we have Acapulco last October being the extreme example of rapid intensification.
[00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:24.069]  An insignificant low pressure system developed into the strongest Cat 5 hurricane to ever hit that part of the world in less than 24 hours, laid waste to Acapulco.
[00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:33.630]  And by the way, Hurricane John, which just hit Acapulco again, As Hurricane Helene was wreaking havoc in the Carolinas, not many people know that.
[00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:35.750]  So Acapulco just got dealt another blow.
[00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:44.309]  So again, how many agendas and objectives are being carried out when we know they can manipulate these storms and we know they can make or break them anytime they want?
[00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:54.549]  And again, I bring up the oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico that seems to magically miss any sort of damaging storm again and again and again.
[00:17:55.559 --> 00:18:00.400]  While the storms wreak havoc inland and on shorelines, it's not a coincidence.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:09.039]  You know, they were talking about climate change yesterday, and now we're learning that scientists and researchers are looking at how to change the weather on purpose.
[00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:13.880]  That's right. Lasers now could one day manipulate rain and lightning.
[00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:18.539]  CBS This Morning contributor Michio Kaku is a physics professor at City College of New York.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.220]  Professor, nice to see you.
[00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.619]  Extraordinary seeing Al Gore and Bill Clinton there together with Charlie, wasn't it?
[00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:26.480]  That's right. Yeah. They did not get into this discussion, though.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.079]  But it is fascinating.
[00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.259]  I mean, lasers? Really?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.160]  To change the weather? That's right.
[00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:38.119]  Well, as Mark Twain once famously said, everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.
[00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:49.809]  Well, instead of doing a rain dance, we physicists are firing trillion-watt lasers into the sky to actually precipitate rain clouds and actually bring down lightning bolts.
[00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:52.089]  This is potentially a game changer.
[00:18:52.329 --> 00:18:54.170]  But this is experimental. It's experimental.
[00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.430]  However, in the laboratory so far it works.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:03.140]  When you have water vapor and you have dust particles or ice crystals, you can precipitate rain.
[00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.920]  It condenses around the seeds.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.980]  These seeds can also be created by laser beams.
[00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:18.160]  By firing trillion watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons, creating what are called ions, and these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:29.309]  Well, this fascinates me in part because, too, I remember reading the stories that China had used this during the Olympics, that the USSR had used this after Chernobyl to create rain clouds.
[00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:31.509]  Did those really work then?
[00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.410]  We have some of these capabilities now?
[00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:41.450]  Inconclusive. Even in the 60s, the CIA used this to bring down monsoons during the Vietnam War to wash out the Viet Cong.
[00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.210]  Governments have been...
[00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.509]  Alleged to. Alleged to.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:53.359]  Alleged too, right? Yeah. Now, we've realized that for decades now, these governments have been alleged to have experimented with weather control, but nothing conclusive.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.359]  Bullshit. This time we're bringing in the laws of physics, rather than simply waving our hands and uttering mumbo jumbo.
[00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.960]  We're actually using trillion watt lasers now.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.359]  And in the laboratory, sure enough, they precipitate rain out of water vapor.
[00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:11.039]  Sure enough, you can actually bring down electricity down the beam.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.880]  We're actually using trillion watt lasers now.
[00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:30.339]  All of them could be subject to weather modification for floods, you name it, outdoor events in agriculture and even hurricanes.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:21:10.690]  And even hurricanes? Again,
[00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.730]  this is mainly a visual video, but I wanted to get it on record.
[00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:21.750]  It's very powerful. The Democrats are all bragging that it's going to stop the voting of the conservatives and block mail-in ballots for conservatives and let them do a bunch of chicanery during the chaos.
[00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.049]  Now, here is the former head of the CIA, at the time the head of the CIA in 2015.
[00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:33.849]  This is Brennan talking about how they have the weather control, but they have all these treaties.
[00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.289]  They don't want the public to know about it.
[00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.609]  Here it is. Another example is the array of technologies.
[00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:45.869]  Often referred to collectively as geoengineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[00:21:46.450 --> 00:22:00.250]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:11.269]  The technology's potential to alter weather patterns And benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.950]  And there it is. No longer conspiracy.
[00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:15.609]  CIA admits plans for aerosol spraying for geoengineering.
[00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:17.349]  They're all doing it in secret.
[00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.730]  Much of it's declassified, but they act like it's not going on to the public.
[00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.190]  Breaking. Lawmakers briefed on weather modification tech.
[00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:33.259]  Conclude Hurricane Helena was DOD-linked weather weapon deployed against American people.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.000]  Kind of a big deal. That's on Infowars.com.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.559]  All right. There's no way to start with the most important document because depending on how you research, it's all important.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:50.259]  But let me just start running through documents and mainstream news articles for you so you can go look this up for yourself when they say, Alex Jones claims, you know, that it's a weather weapon.
[00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:54.480]  There's no such thing. And when I say they're saying it, they're already saying it everywhere.
[00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.250]  Almost science fiction.
[00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.470]  NOAA.gov. And they've been removing this, by the way.
[00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:02.890]  Almost science fiction.
[00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:04.750]  Hurricane modification and Project Storm Fury.
[00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.329]  National Weather Service.
[00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.329]  1960s through the 1980s.
[00:23:09.609 --> 00:23:17.130]  Total control of hurricanes. And those very type of aircraft you see here, they're still using those exact ones, taking off and flying into Helena and into Milton.
[00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.150]  And flying around in circles doing exactly you-know-what.
[00:23:23.399 --> 00:23:26.339]  7th anniversary of the first hurricane seeding experiment.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.299]  NOAA.gov.
[00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:30.599]  See that? They're removing all this stuff.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.099]  Project Storm Fury.
[00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:34.619]  Wikipedia. Go read about it.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.519]  And now you've got it.
[00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:39.660]  One of the biggest hurricanes ever, up to 180 miles an hour.
[00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:43.700]  Milton. All right.
[00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:49.079]  Don't worry. We've got fact checkers saying...
[00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.049]  That I'm saying we need to get the lithium.
[00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.410]  I'm not the one saying that. Congressional reports on it.
[00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:05.569]  The footage I showed in the last hour, the hour before, of the planes going around, shipped by the Weather Service and by the Department of Energy to control the hurricane.
[00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:12.650]  All the different little HAARP facilities all over the Western world, like in England, to control the weather.
[00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:20.200]  Got the... People like Axelrod saying this is great, it's keeping conservative areas from voting.
[00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:22.539]  Played that video, audio yesterday.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:33.559]  But right now, and I've got all the footage inside the government aircraft of the chemtrailing, geoengineering, videos, CBS admitting lasers controlling the weather.
[00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:49.549]  The head of the program under Operation Popeye for the CIA and the Navy and the Air Force, Ben Livingston, played those clips two hours ago, Make Mud Not War, how the U.S. weather warfare in Vietnam, The Guardian, Operation Popeye, you can read all about it.
[00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:56.269]  Environmental Modification Convention of the United Nations, 1977-78.
[00:24:56.589 --> 00:25:04.130]  You can go to the UN. This is StateDepartment.gov and read all about the weather control treaties they signed back then.
[00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.849]  They agreed not to tell the public about it in the treaty.
[00:25:07.369 --> 00:25:10.490]  The details, Environmental Modification Convention.
[00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.690]  Then they are now telling the public about it slowly.
[00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.349]  London Telegraph, scientists step closer to steering hurricanes.
[00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.069]  Oh, in a perfect circle, getting it to go where they want.
[00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:23.910]  Just like it does in the actual flight pass.
[00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:30.190]  See how that works? Scientists think they can control the weather with lasers.
[00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:35.789]  CBS News. All right.
[00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.990]  Now let's go into some documents.
[00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:48.849]  Okay, this is publication 94-490, October 13, 1976.
[00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:58.390]  94th Congress, public law ahead of the UN ratifying the law on the Weather Modification Convention.
[00:26:00.089 --> 00:26:01.650]  The law passed.
[00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:04.430]  Here's the law for you.
[00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.690]  Public law 94-490.
[00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.170]  94th Congress.
[00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:14.279]  Alright, here's another one.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.920]  Patent granted for a system that manipulates hurricanes.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.420]  We'll show you the patent in a moment.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.059]  Oh, what's it use?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.380]  This is in 2003.
[00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:32.920]  The head of the HAARP program at the current time on in 2006.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.900]  For some reason, the Pentagon called.
[00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:38.640]  The Air Force colonel said that the head of the HAARP program is a civilian.
[00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:40.539]  He wants to come on your show for some reason.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:50.589]  He came on. And admitted they controlled the weather and could actually light the atmosphere on fire with HAARP. They built systems everywhere, and they thought, I should know that.
[00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:58.559]  The interview's out there. And here it is with Harp Systems, How to Control a Hurricane, U.S. Patent Application Publication.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:08.180]  It was granted. And that's 2003-0085-296, May 8, 2003.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:17.680]  And it goes over how to control it, how to steer them, how to kill them, how to make them stronger, how to make them weaker, all using Doppler radar.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.539]  And they've got giant Doppler. Floating mobile oil drilling platforms with huge control systems in the Gulf, the Atlantic.
[00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:27.640]  And they deploy it against the American people.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.980]  That's how they steer it. They have all the figures there.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.420]  How they do it. How they make clouds bigger.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.039]  How they make them rain. How they dissipate clouds.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.779]  It's all right there. Read all the science on that.
[00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:45.000]  They're just going to call this disinformation.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.339]  I said, oh, it's just, oh, hey, you want to ban semi-autos?
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.799]  Kamala. Nope, disinformation. Hey, you said you gave the mighty illegal aliens from FEMA. Disinformation.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.019]  Doesn't matter if you have the clip, doesn't matter if I just showed it to you.
[00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.349]  Hey, you say X and Y chromosomes don't exist.
[00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.029]  That's right, disinformation. We've known for decades our planet is warming, that we would start seeing the brutal effects.
[00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:08.390]  But conservatives remain so deep in their denial, they're flailing around for anyone or anything else to blame.
[00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:26.890]  Republican Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is now, like, a big mover and shaker in the Republican Party, Is promoting a bizarre conspiracy theory about a mysterious they, you can imagine who that is, controlling the weather, suggesting that they are sending hurricanes to Republican areas to impact the election.
[00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:30.369]  Like, someone is sitting at some computer somewhere pressing hurricane.
[00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:32.970]  Now the claims are getting even more bizarre.
[00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:39.849]  Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather.
[00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:41.069]  We're controlling the weather.
[00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.130]  It's beyond ridiculous.
[00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:48.259]  Here's one also from the federal government.

[00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.849]  When you hear the name Bill Gates, you probably think Microsoft founder.
[00:30:27.089 --> 00:30:30.690]  But now the billionaire may be known as the Hurricane Tamer.
[00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:36.529]  Gates is listed as one of 13 inventors on a patent filed for hurricane prevention methods.
[00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:39.309]  And he's over the world ID program.
[00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.569]  And he's over the world poison shot program.
[00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:46.809]  Yep, there it is. Let me show you another one on Bill Gates.
[00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:49.809]  This is Fox News, also Forbes.

[00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.980]  Alrighty. This is an interesting document right here.
[00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:08.259]  You might want to read. Weather and climate modification.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:15.740]  A report... And a special commission in weather modification, National Science Foundation.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:26.000]  1985. You might want to read all about this.

[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:53.759]  It goes through it all. Now, the conclusion by the late 80s was, don't ever tell the public about this, just do it.
[00:32:53.819 --> 00:32:56.859]  And I already played the CIA director earlier under Obama saying it.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.859]  All right? You see, this is a whole book we printed, Overhead Shot Place.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.859]  You might just want to go read this.
[00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:08.279]  And this was republished.
[00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:09.960]  It was updated in the 80s. This is from 1965.
[00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:18.950]  Department of Defense, Air Force, what they're doing.

[00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.490]  And people will be like, where will we get it?
[00:33:26.569 --> 00:33:28.289]  I know when this is on X later, we're streaming it.
[00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.190]  It'll be like, show me the leak!
[00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:38.829]  It's like last week when the Democrats filed in Austin Court to take over the company on the hearings the 17th to be the 18th.
[00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:45.640]  I posted like five things on X with the document, and then later the full show went up, and I heard all the comments go, where is it?
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.720]  We don't believe it.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:34:03.799]  It's not real. You just type in weather and climate modification, report on the Special Commission on Weather Modification, National Science Foundation, or just type in National Science Foundation Climate Modification, show everybody on Google for TV viewers.
[00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:04.880]  Just type in and show them.
[00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:08.440]  Okay, I can lead a horse to water, but I can't make it drink.
[00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:21.239]  So, that is just a small smattering of what we've got for you.
[00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:25.659]  Oh, look, they typed in what I said, depending on weather modification.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.000]  Oh, look, U.S. Department of Defense.
[00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.840]  Oh, look, weather modification.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.500]  Wikipedia. Oh, look, National Science Foundation.
[00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:32.920]  Oh, there it is. Oh, God, Third Link, so hard to do.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.539]  Where is it, Alex?
[00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:35.880]  Where is it, Alex?
[00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:39.780]  Where is it? The government is a breakaway civilization.
[00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:42.719]  They're mad scientists. They treat us like children.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:50.639]  We act like children. They're doing all this genetic engineering and all this chemical manipulation and all this weather control and all this other insanity.
[00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.380]  Blame God. You can go research it.
[00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.199]  Enough stuff to send them all to prison 10 million times is public.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.619]  Imagine what we don't know.
[00:35:03.469 --> 00:35:06.869]  And it's a life and death situation to get people to understand this.
[00:35:06.989 --> 00:35:09.570]  Plus, it's incredible. It's wild to learn all this.
[00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.250]  It's cool and fun to fight evil.
[00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:13.570]  It's great to get involved.
[00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.449]  It's great to know about all this stuff.
[00:35:15.789 --> 00:35:18.670]  And I just feel like everybody's like me, and more and more people are.
[00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:27.369]  All right, I'm going to hit one final key document that I didn't get to that is probably one of the most important.
[00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.820]  This was declassified a decade ago.
[00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:33.579]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:36:00.199]  This is the CIA secret memorandum to the Chief General Science Division of the Astrogeophysics Branch Weather Modification CIA October 7th 1965.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:16.219]  And you want to read the whole document, subject weather modification, and you want to turn to this page here on screen, weather modification.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:26.340]  It is clear that we must press forward to improve our ability to detect, track, and predict severe weather hazards.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:39.659]  It is equally clear that That the time has come for us to move vigorously forward to explore possibilities of modifying and controlling the weather in beneficial ways.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.719]  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of weather modification to the nation at large.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:37:08.369]  If we in the United States were to acquire the ability to modify the weather in a substantial way, which they're already doing, to augment precipitation, to blunt precipitation, The thrust of hurricanes, or make them stronger, and other severe storms to support and to suppress hail to crop areas,
[00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:18.170]  to crops with lightning and discharges in the forecast area, and to dissipate all types of fog, we could have an achievement of vast significance.
[00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:33.480]  We would be able to expand our national economy and to improve The well-being of the American people in ways and to a degree that are now inconceivable.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:40.159]  The ultimate benefits that weather modification can bring are almost unimaginable.
[00:37:54.190 --> 00:38:10.949]  It lays the predicate and the foundation for the development of a weather satellite that will permit man to determine the world's cloud layer and ultimately to control the weather,
[00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.769]  and he who controls the weather will control the world.
[00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:23.050]  There are many known ways to control the weather, and the best way to steer it seems to be with the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar network.
[00:38:23.269 --> 00:38:31.309]  The circular blue flashes seen in this video are frequency transmissions from the NEXRAD network of transmitter installations.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:41.360]  The brighter the blue flash from a frequency transmission installation, the more pronounced and powerful the repelling effect on any air mass or storm in the vicinity will be.
[00:38:41.659 --> 00:38:50.039]  Where there are no blue flashes, there is no transmission, thus no repelling effect, thus no resistance for a migrating storm.
[00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:59.019]  Translation, a migrating storm will be hindered from moving toward frequency transmissions and will easily migrate in a direction with no transmissions.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:06.500]  So again I ask, Was Hurricane Helene's path and behavior just an act of nature, or was it engineered?
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:13.619]  Whatever happened during Hurricane Helene, our own government is actively killing the victims of the flooding.
[00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:17.579]  We're in Nashville, and I saw two Air Force helicopter 60s.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.900]  And I knew there were PJs just looking at them.
[00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:22.500]  And I went up to them, like, hey guys, like, what are y'all doing?
[00:39:22.699 --> 00:39:24.420]  And I'm like, this is what you need to be doing.
[00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:26.139]  This, this, this, this is how I'm finding people.
[00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:27.360]  And they're like, we can't go.
[00:39:27.519 --> 00:39:28.719]  We're waiting on Title 10 orders.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.949]  And I'm like, what? They just, they can't get any authority.
[00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:36.690]  There's military helicopters all over here sitting on the ground and they can't do nothing.
[00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.869]  Even my JSOC boys in Fayetteville, they can't get orders to come out here.
[00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.150]  It is just the most disgusting thing and they're killing these people.
[00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:45.630]  And I don't know why they're doing it.
[00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.789]  I don't know what kind of conspiracy.
[00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:55.570]  I've heard so many things, whatever you want to come up with, but they are literally allowing these people to fucking die in the mountains right now because we can't get helicopters.
[00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.880]  Not only is the government standing down, they are stopping others from helping.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.280]  And there are even reports that the confiscated donations are being delivered to sanctuary cities.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.559]  So I'm here in Boone, North Carolina.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.019]  I'm at the staging area.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.880]  I volunteered myself and my canines to come up and do some search and rescue efforts.
[00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:16.480]  Obviously you see all my equipment.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.719]  So we've been told to just turn around and go the opposite direction because what they're doing is they're compensating everything.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.920]  They would compensate all of my gear, my car, my dogs, like literally everything.
[00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:35.929]  There are some people Who have been tracking these FEMA agents and what they do with these supplies after.
[00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.210]  And these are people that are directly associated with the group that I'm volunteering with.
[00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:53.409]  And essentially what they're doing is they're taking these supplies to sanctuary areas for illegal migrants and giving it all to them.
[00:40:53.929 --> 00:41:02.389]  An unmarked black helicopter was caught on camera deliberately causing thousands of dollars of damage to a donation and support center.
[00:41:02.789 --> 00:41:04.929]  The government is no longer trying to hide.
[00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.630]  They are now killing us out in the open.
[00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:12.909]  And the radical Marxists working at FEMA are not really concerned with most of the people.
[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:20.170]  LGBTQIA people and people who have been disadvantaged already Are struggling.
[00:41:20.389 --> 00:41:23.769]  They already have their own things to deal with.
[00:41:23.929 --> 00:41:30.409]  So you add a disaster on top of that, it's just compounding on itself.
[00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:41.829]  You know, the shift that we're seeing right now is a shift in emergency management from utilitarian principles where everything is designed for the greatest good, for the greatest amount of people, to disaster equity.
[00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:47.099]  We the people point out that they are killing us and they complain that it's hurtful.
[00:41:47.519 --> 00:41:50.519]  What kind of impact has this had on the recovery effort?
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:00.860]  It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there, but it's also demoralizing.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:13.559]  Right after the government says they don't have enough money for the American people stricken by the floods and that another storm is coming, they announce another $157 million to the people of Lebanon.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:23.260]  Joe Biden makes another Freudian slip and says the government's response will be to increase the number and intensity of these extreme weather events.
[00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:38.320]  And many are now saying that this is exactly what they did with Milton, which is now expected to be catastrophic.
[00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:41.599]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:02.460]  Man is on a quest to play God.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.099]  To control the weather and use it as a weapon.
[00:43:07.579 --> 00:43:12.119]  Lightning, torrential rains, hurricanes targeted at the enemy.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:18.239]  The ultimate war is if you never have to fire a round and nobody ever knew you'd launch the fight.
[00:43:19.139 --> 00:43:22.059]  Is it possible there have already been attacks using weather weapons?
[00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:30.239]  If you get down low enough, you can actually see a clear layer above the antenna.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.820]  It is actually pushing these water particles up.
[00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:36.079]  And that's exactly how HAARP works.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:44.960]  What we've done is we've not only pushed the cloud off of the HAARP antenna, but as you can see, our cloud is almost completely gone inside.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.719]  HAARP does exactly the same thing.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.579]  It ionizes the particles, pushes them out into space.
[00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:57.210]  HARP is one of several ELF wave transmitters located all over the globe.
[00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:07.570]  The United States owns and operates three of them, one in Gakona, Alaska, another in Fairbanks, Alaska, and one in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
[00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:15.929]  Russia has one in Vasilorsky near Nizhny, Novgorod, and the European Union has one near Trumse in Norway.
[00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:29.219]  Working in tandem, these transmitters could potentially alter the weather anywhere in the world, changing the jet stream's course entirely, triggering massive rainstorms or droughts.
[00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:38.320]  Even hurricane steering would be possible by heating up the atmosphere and building up high-pressure domes that could deflect or change the course of hurricanes.
[00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:46.000]  The U.S. government is firm in its position that HAARP is just an atmospheric research facility.
[00:44:46.869 --> 00:44:57.150]  But is it more than coincidence that since going online, some experts have reported strange weather anomalies, including massive floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes?
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.239]  Now let's be 100% clear and we'll go to our guest and give him the floor.
[00:45:09.539 --> 00:45:18.880]  We have the CIA director 2015-16 in speeches saying we can do this, we've been doing it, but we don't want to tell the public about it because of lawsuits.
[00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:25.179]  So it's going on. We have the leading expert, Dane Whittington, on with us at geoengineeringwatch.org right now.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.780]  There's so many places to start, so many places to go here.
[00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:31.340]  So Dane, I'm just going to give you the floor here to go where you think first.
[00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:33.260]  Dane, thanks for joining us.
[00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.469]  Alex, good to be with you again, brother.
[00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.289]  Thank you for always staying the course in this fight on so many fronts.
[00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:49.269]  The American public and elected officials are beginning to wake up to the fact that the covert weather warfare assault has been waged for decades against them.
[00:45:49.510 --> 00:46:00.289]  In regards to Hurricane Milton and the method with which these storms have been manipulated, the spawning is a separate issue, the spawning of the storms.
[00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.909]  But what we can say definitively is they are steering these storms.
[00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:18.260]  And Milton took We believe an unexpected jog toward the southeast, toward the Yucatan Peninsula, where a massive transmitter in Cancun nudged it back on course, and we recorded those transmissions as well.
[00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:23.059]  It spun up to, we believe, earlier than they had scheduled it to.
[00:46:23.139 --> 00:46:28.380]  It spun up to the strong Cat5 that we saw, again making it much more difficult to manipulate.
[00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:32.019]  So it may have gone off course a bit from where it was scheduled to go.
[00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:36.630]  They're more difficult to control the stronger the storm is, especially over the ocean.
[00:46:36.769 --> 00:46:42.570]  Once it reaches land, we have the NEXRAD network that is more capable of steering these storms.
[00:46:43.389 --> 00:46:44.869]  And again, these are patented technologies.
[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:57.289]  So whatever agendas and objectives, again, there may be about this storm, where it's scheduled to make landfall, we can speculate about, again, all those agendas and objectives.
[00:46:57.449 --> 00:47:04.760]  There's likely many. The screen you're showing right there, Hurricane Helene, And the NEXRAD transmissions that have a repelling effect on the storm.
[00:47:05.039 --> 00:47:14.679]  That's again what happened in Cancun as the storm went southeast, and we believe that wasn't part of their original agenda, that it went off course a bit.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.679]  And the transmitter in Cancun, very powerful transmitter, pushed it back.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.780]  And again, we recorded those transmissions as well.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.760]  So bottom line is these storms are being steered, period.
[00:47:25.199 --> 00:47:29.880]  If we go all the way back to 1947, Alex, I know you know this, many of your listeners do as well.
[00:47:30.409 --> 00:47:39.440]  But Project Cirrus, the US military's initial onset of manipulating hurricanes, How far have they come since then?
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.300]  And again, for people to deny climate engineering at this point is absolutely ludicrous.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:58.260]  And we know even Project Popeye in Vietnam in the 60s, historical record, U.S. military is so effective at controlling precipitation over that country that by the mid-70s we have international treaties forbidding weather modification in wartime, not that anybody pays attention to those.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.099]  So, Alex, this is nothing short of weather warfare, period.
[00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:17.260]  And then we have The fake environmentalists making everything about carbon dioxide, not atrazine and nuclear reactors melting down, saying, oh, the weather's getting worse because you're not paying your carbon tax, literally terrorizing people with this.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.500]  And we have all the CIA reports going back to the 60s, 70s, 80s, admitting all of this.
[00:48:21.619 --> 00:48:22.760]  I showed them yesterday.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.480]  While you talk, I'll show some of the documents.
[00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:27.579]  People can just type in the headline from the document and then pull it up themselves.
[00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:28.840]  It's at CIA.gov.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.500]  It's at Congress's website.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.659]  We're talking about a fact here.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.900]  I interviewed Ben Livingston.
[00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.670]  You know, one of the first guys ever being involved in this.
[00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:42.050]  And I remember I was attacking HAARP and having Dr.
[00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.309]  Nick Bagach on in 2000.
[00:48:43.909 --> 00:48:50.369]  And in 2006, we get a call from an Air Force colonel at HAARP. And he said the director of HAARP would like to come on.
[00:48:50.429 --> 00:48:53.369]  That interview's out there. And the guy came on and said, yeah, we can control the weather.
[00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:55.829]  We can even ignite the atmosphere, but big deal, it's not bad.
[00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.030]  So they admit all this, and we have the patents.
[00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:04.010]  But then at one level, the CIA head goes on C-SPAN and admits it all.
[00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.070]  But then you and I talk about it, and we get attacked, and they say we're crazy.
[00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:12.550]  But meanwhile, places like Dubai, for decades, admit they control their weather and can use Doppler radar.
[00:49:13.429 --> 00:49:15.650]  to create rain or to steer storms.
[00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:22.869]  Why don't you explain to people how Doppler radar is able to manipulate and energize the atmosphere and steer these storms?
[00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:37.780]  Well again, it has a repelling effect and that is extraordinarily visible from the NEXRAD We recorded for Hurricane Harvey, Ian, Maria, Michael, again and again and again.
[00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:44.519]  And you don't need to know anything about meteorology to see visibly the effect of these transmissions on the storms.
[00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:54.500]  If we go to Dubai, thank you for mentioning that, is it just a coincidence that days after Dubai announced it was going to ditch the dollar, they get deluged?
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.760]  With two years worth of rain and I think six hours, is that just a coincidence?
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.199]  And we see this sort of scenario over and over and over.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:14.199]  And again, when these technologies have existed for so long, and as a matter of historical record, we have somewhat over 200 patents at this point right now existing.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:32.059]  The denial of this is criminal, and we would argue at geoengineeringwatch.org that everybody either actively or passively participating in these crimes, be it an elected official or media or a so-called weather expert that is participating in the cover-up of these crimes,
[00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:34.099]  does that not make them also culpable?
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.440]  So at geoengineeringwatch.org, we are trying to make known who's authoring articles.
[00:50:40.519 --> 00:50:57.320]  For example, a recent article from the New York Times, Alex, from Christopher Flavel, who did his best to marginalize this incredibly dire issue, he referred to the interview exchange I did with Robert F. Kennedy, And try to mock and marginalize that.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.380]  These people are increasingly desperate to mask what can't be hidden for much longer.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:08.619]  And that's what I would encourage those trying to share this most dire issue in the ridicule and resistance they get from family and friends.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.139]  Know that this issue will be exposed.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.679]  You can't hide this. You can't put it in the rearview mirror.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.400]  It's getting bigger and more ominous in front of the windshield every day.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:49.250]  They're becoming more bold with their weather warfare Actions because the public so far hasn't responded even when you have a hurricane like Helene that again there could be various objectives there the Piedmont lithium mine in Piedmont in North Carolina hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars with DOD contracts coming due for that lithium the owners landowners being a roadblock for them and now those and owners have been washed away literally so again let me stop you because When I was thinking about you coming on the show yesterday,
[00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.530]  I meant to ask that question up front.
[00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:55.750]  So thank you for bringing up the most important point in my view.
[00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:58.349]  And let me just stop here, and I want you to really take your time answering this.
[00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:11.309]  You are, hands down, the last 25 years, the leading organization group of the scientists and others testifying to, you know, legislatures, Congress, you name it, exposing the real documents, the real admissions of this thing hiding in plain view.
[00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:18.469]  I am seeing explosive awakening to this in the last few years, and it's really at a crescendo now everywhere.
[00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:27.769]  People on the street, family, dominating social media, videos with hundreds of millions of views just all over the place talking about this.
[00:52:27.909 --> 00:52:30.389]  And so you've been hammering away at this.
[00:52:30.469 --> 00:52:32.190]  I've been hammering away. So many others have.
[00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.070]  And it got some traction.
[00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:38.869]  It's such a key issue. But now it's really broken into the consciousness.
[00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.590]  Can you speak to what's happening in your statement that they can't hold this back anymore?
[00:52:42.769 --> 00:52:43.949]  The storm of awakening.
[00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:54.030]  Certainly, Alex. You and InfoWars have been so pivotal and key in helping to blow this issue out into the open.
[00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.949]  Your voice is heard around the world.
[00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.170]  InfoWars is known around the world.
[00:52:58.329 --> 00:52:59.570]  And it's you and you can watch that already.
[00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:05.050]  Immensely grateful to you and InfoWars for your help with sounding the alarm on this issue.
[00:53:05.769 --> 00:53:14.070]  And because of the damage being done by these operations, That is manifesting every single day in the DOD response to this.
[00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:20.570]  And I don't mean to implicate just the U.S. DOD. We have governments around the globe colluding and cooperating with this issue.
[00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:32.150]  In fact, so much so that we know we have historical records of Soviet climate modification scientists touring the U.S. at the height of the Cold War in the 60s and our scientists going there.
[00:53:32.289 --> 00:53:39.929]  So whatever the surface tensions are between these nations, They have definitely been colluding and cooperating on climate engineering operations.
[00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.130]  So the bottom line, and what's on the screen now, I want to explain that quickly.
[00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:58.469]  These are localized, quote, weather modification operations that are designed as a smokescreen to mask the unfathomably larger climate intervention operations.
[00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:04.150]  So picture whatever particulate matter is going up on that screen that's shown right now.
[00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:09.739]  You might have a few grams of material floating into the sky.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:18.019]  Compare that with a KC-135 military tanker that's dumping 100 tons of toxic nanoparticles in one payload.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:34.030]  So, again, we have a power structure that's tried to mask the climate engineering operations with, quote, weather modification, Operations that are publicized, that are known, the single-engine propeller-driven aircraft many times, Alex, with a few flares on the wings that might drop,
[00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:37.090]  in that case, five kilos of material into the sky.
[00:54:37.269 --> 00:54:41.989]  Again, compare that with a KC-135 that will dump 100 tons in a single payload.
[00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:58.730]  In fact, Alex, we've extrapolated, I'll leave with this, but we've extrapolated, based on our testing at GeoengineeringWatch.org, and we took a NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Flying lab to altitude, which no private party will ever get access to again.
[00:54:58.869 --> 00:55:02.449]  That was a set of extenuating circumstances and great expense for us.
[00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.469]  But we took that to altitude with top scientists.
[00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:06.429]  It's all in the dimming documentary.
[00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.469]  We sampled what heavy aircraft were emitting.
[00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:14.869]  We processed that at Rinsler Polytechnic in New York, world-renowned lab, found what we knew we would find, starting with aluminum nanoparticles.
[00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:30.590]  So working with University of Minnesota with hundreds of lab tests, We have extrapolated what the likely global dispersion of these elements is, and that's about 40 to 60 million tons annually.
[00:55:30.889 --> 00:55:38.630]  So is it any wonder, Alex, that every other commercial on TV is asthma this, COPD that, respiratory everything?
[00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:40.309]  And yes, there's pollution.
[00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:42.150]  We recognize that. We're not denying that.
[00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:54.630]  When you have this intentional dumping of nanoparticles that are extremely inflammatory to the respiratory systems of toxic elements, aluminum, barium, strontium, manganese, polymer fibers, surfactants, there's HARP that you're showing now.
[00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:58.050]  And that HARP is an ionosphere heater.
[00:55:58.309 --> 00:56:06.130]  It's directional. They can bounce that signal off the atmosphere and bring it down in places over a great spectrum.
[00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:09.570]  The director told me on air at the time they can ignite the atmosphere.
[00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:16.210]  It's so powerful. Yeah, I've heard him say that, and we can't know the totality of the capability.
[00:56:16.429 --> 00:56:29.690]  What Hart does, transmits 3.6 million watts of power into the electrically charged ionosphere, causes an electrical chain reaction, which superheats that layer of the atmosphere and causes the atmosphere to expand up and down.
[00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:34.829]  Alex, you've probably heard the term high-pressure heat dome a lot lately.
[00:56:34.929 --> 00:56:36.690]  We hear the meteorologist saying it all the time, right?
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:44.219]  So that's what you get from an ionosphere heater, a high-pressure heat dome, compressing air.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.219]  And we're experiencing that in the West Coast right now.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.820]  It's like living in hell.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:53.659]  Temperatures never cool down day or night, and you have very little air movement under that heat dome.
[00:56:54.039 --> 00:57:00.960]  And they can circulate the jet stream in a clockwise manner around that heat dome in the Northern Hemisphere and direct it back down to other locations.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:08.280]  The degree to which the climate system has been derailed by these operations is total at this point.
[00:57:09.519 --> 00:57:18.179]  Now, expanding on my question about the level of the awakening you're seeing, I appreciate the credit to us, but we're all in this together, and people are interested in the general public.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:28.940]  Why do you think you're seeing such a mass awakening, A, and then B, just like the Manhattan Project went on for four or five years, they kept it totally secret, hundreds of thousands of people working on it.
[00:57:29.619 --> 00:57:32.880]  Well, we know there's all these other big projects, and we have all the CIA documents.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.619]  I showed them yesterday. They admitted it was a giant secret project starting in the 60s.
[00:57:36.699 --> 00:57:44.340]  It even went back to 47, but officially in the 60s, going into full scale, saying it was their most important project in documents I showed yesterday.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:50.539]  And so we're trying to expose this thing much bigger than Manhattan Project that's hidden in plain view.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.199]  So can you speak to both those questions?
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.739]  Yeah, the way you frame that is exactly correct.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:02.320]  Exactly correct. And people who deny this because they say it couldn't be hidden, it isn't being hidden.
[00:58:02.599 --> 00:58:04.059]  It's simply being denied.
[00:58:04.599 --> 00:58:07.400]  Anybody that's not clinically blind can see what's going on in our skies.
[00:58:07.539 --> 00:58:13.980]  You don't have grid patterns one day and nothing the next with similar atmospheric conditions unless something's being dispersed in our skies.
[00:58:14.099 --> 00:58:21.659]  And we have up close film footage of these aircraft, Alex, KC-10s, KC-135, C-17s, nozzles visible turning on and off.
[00:58:22.159 --> 00:58:31.820]  Nothing's being hidden. We just have a public that wants to be lied to and wants to believe those lies, and that's finally, thankfully, breaking down as the public is being personally impacted by these operations.
[00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:39.619]  So the, quote, hiding of this issue is no different than pretending that certain medical treatments are, quote, safe and effective.
[00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:41.349]  When they're anything but.
[00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.550]  For decades, we have the whole medical industrial complex going along with that.
[00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:56.309]  And it makes it easier to hide also, Alex, when you have illegal federal gag orders on National Weather Service and NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, all agency operations under that gag order.
[00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:05.349]  So the bottom line is we have an industry that In the case of the federal weather disseminating agencies are being gagged.
[00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:09.489]  In the case of the local meteorologists, they're just concerned about their paychecks and pensions.
[00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.130]  Alex, you're literally reading scripts.
[00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:25.090]  The skies you see right there in that video are so typical in so many regions, and we have the local meteorologists Days in advance, sometimes a week in advance, stating that a day will be mostly sunny or filtered sunshine.
[00:59:25.469 --> 00:59:27.170]  And that's filtered sunshine.
[00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:35.449]  How would that meteorologist know a week in advance that there's going to be aerosol spraying operations on those days unless they're reading a script?
[00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:45.820]  Well, then we have, while they deny all this the last decade, We're good to go.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:59.679]  We're good to go.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.039]  But we don't want to, quote, scare the public so we can't really talk about it.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.219]  And then meanwhile, there's just this giant program.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.440]  Then they admit what?
[01:00:07.579 --> 01:00:11.519]  I've seen a NASA report the Earth 20% dimmer than it was 50 years ago.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.079]  You're correct. That's where the term global dimming comes from.
[01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:24.820]  And for your listeners, most of which are highly educated on this, many of them might know this, but solar radiation management, that is the stated purpose for what is going on in our skies.
[01:00:25.179 --> 01:00:28.940]  It lays the predicate and the foundation for the development of a weather satellite.
[01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:44.719]  That will permit man to determine the world's cloud layer and ultimately to control the weather, and he who controls the weather will control the world.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:01:00.440]  The film you just showed of Lyndon Johnson, 1962, former President Johnson stating on film and on the record that we had the power to control the world's cloud layer then, And quote, he who controls the weather controls the world.
[01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:02.000]  Of course they're doing this.
[01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:07.639]  Those who print the money, who control everything, they control militaries, thus they control countries, they control media.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:18.679]  Of course they're controlling the weather, the covert weapon which they can and are bringing populations to their knees all over the world and have been for decades without those populations ever even knowing they're under assault.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.440]  And you got interrupted by the break.
[01:01:22.539 --> 01:01:23.820]  Can you go back into your own words?
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.719]  You were saying, this is not by accident.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.400]  It's not a program run awry.
[01:01:27.619 --> 01:01:28.719]  This is malevolent.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.980]  Start over. That's important.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.480]  Well, it is, again, because many people want to pretend that there's good intentions here.
[01:01:36.639 --> 01:01:39.199]  They're just perhaps running off the rails a bit.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.659]  That couldn't be further from the truth.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.380]  These people know exactly what they're doing.
[01:01:43.019 --> 01:01:52.619]  In the film, The Dimming, again, available for free on the homepage of geoengineeringwatch.org, that film, in spite of social media censorship, is over 25 million views and counting.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:58.940]  So on that film, you can see me confronting the world's most recognized climate engineer, Dr.
[01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:01.400]  David Keith, at an international geoengineering conference.
[01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:04.210]  After a three-and-a-half-hour symposium of Dr.
[01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:11.190]  Keith proposing, as if it wasn't already happening, the dumping of tens of millions of tons of aluminum nanoparticles into the atmosphere.
[01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:16.710]  And what I confronted him about was, have you done toxicological studies of doing that?
[01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.730]  And he stumbled a bit and paraphrased.
[01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:23.449]  He basically stated, well, there's a lot of particulate pollution in the atmosphere anyway.
[01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.909]  A little more won't hurt.
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.090]  And I cornered him with that.
[01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:31.949]  That particular pollution isn't aluminum, bioavailable, toxic to everything that lives, aluminum.
[01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:36.650]  And he then stated this, Alex, We haven't studied that.
[01:02:36.769 --> 01:02:38.610]  Could terrible things happen tomorrow?
[01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:42.989]  We don't know. What kind of a statement is that from the world's most recognized climate engineer?
[01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:47.690]  And this is the attitude of these people, Alex, and the second most recognized geoengineer on the planet, Dr.
[01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:51.469]  Ken Caldera, former Department of Defense scientist.
[01:02:51.929 --> 01:03:02.750]  We own an audio of him at GeoengineeringWatch.org stating, in his words, what he did for the DoD, designed methods of spraying pathogens into clouds to infect the populations below.
[01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:04.230]  Think about that.
[01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:08.079]  And now we have pathogens showing up.
[01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:12.099]  In the case of CV-19, we had 85 countries infected in three days.
[01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:15.079]  That's indicative of an airborne dispersion.
[01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:19.940]  We have Italian scientists that say they have found CB19 attached to airborne particulates.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.579]  Do these dots connect?
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:28.860]  So the bottom line is, again, we can hide from forms of medical procedures that we don't want, the injections.
[01:03:29.099 --> 01:03:38.000]  We cannot hide from what they're spraying in our skies and at any moment of their choosing because we have polymer fibers and graphene in our rain.
[01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:45.139]  That's in our lab tests. Those are used militarily for biological carrier platforms to carry a pathogen from the clouds to the ground.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:57.039]  Why would we think the USDOD or those truly controlling the military, again, those who print the money, wouldn't do this if they become desperate enough, which I would argue they're becoming very rapidly.
[01:03:57.219 --> 01:03:59.300]  They could level the playing field overnight, Alex.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.280]  And these are literally mad scientists that are on a total power trip, taking control of society.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:16.519]  We have presidents, vice presidents, CIA directors, I have a stack of CIA, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Technology, all right here, showed it yesterday, admitting this.
[01:04:17.059 --> 01:04:25.179]  And then you go to their big conferences, and they're up there admitting it there, and oh yeah, we spray pathogens on people for the government, meaning viruses and bacteria.
[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:29.210]  And then they just laugh at us.
[01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:30.369]  So there's this weird paradox.
[01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:34.690]  But also, I've literally seen thousands of articles, as you know, the last...
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.489]  You've seen more than I have. You were on this more than I am.
[01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:37.730]  But I'm not even looking for it.
[01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:44.349]  It's in the news every day. Oh, they are spraying with planes to save the Earth from the sun and global warming.
[01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.289]  And as you point out, it goes through and bounces up and blocks it in.
[01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:48.730]  That's what the science shows is the opposite.
[01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:50.289]  And then...
[01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:55.469]  The environmental movements are saying they're going to save us with geoengineering and Bill Gates is going to save us.
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:58.829]  And then we go, okay, well then declassify what you're currently doing.
[01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.269]  And they go, you're crazy. It doesn't exist.
[01:05:00.449 --> 01:05:03.710]  They just play that same game over and over again.
[01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:06.289]  But as you said, people aren't putting up with this now.
[01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:08.630]  And nor should they.
[01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:22.940]  And as you correctly cite, the so-called environmental movement, geoengineeringwatch.org attorneys I've contacted every single major environmental group, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, WWF, all of them.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.260]  And all of them stated that they won't address this issue because they don't want to lose their 501c3 nonprofit.
[01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:31.519]  That is absolutely criminal.
[01:05:32.039 --> 01:05:39.690]  For the record, there's This is what we try to instill in everyone to help us move this fight forward so that we build bridges instead of burn them.
[01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:48.769]  There can be no legitimate discussion of climate, anything from any perspective, without first and foremost addressing the climate engineering elephant in the equation.
[01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:57.590]  And if we hold to that mantra and don't get sidetracked from that from different people, different perspectives from the left is the hardest to reach of all, Alex.
[01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:00.809]  As the proverb goes, you can't add to a cup that's already full.
[01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.469]  They are so incredibly programmed.
[01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:07.349]  That when they hear the word geoengineering, they shut down like kindergarteners.
[01:06:07.489 --> 01:06:16.949]  Literally, I've been at science meetings that when that term comes up, it's like they put their fingers in their ears and start ranting, I can't hear you.
[01:06:17.409 --> 01:06:21.889]  And that kind of infantile behavior from the so-called climate science community needs to be changed.
[01:06:21.969 --> 01:06:33.920]  And the public that knows this is going on, Should email them with many other people CC'd a link to the dimming so that they no longer have an excuse for denying that these programs are operational.
[01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:38.159]  Again, we proved conclusively in the dimming that these programs are ongoing.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.320]  And for those that haven't seen this film, again, posted for free at geoengineerwatch.org the moment it was done.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.980]  And we spent well into six figures on that film.
[01:06:45.059 --> 01:06:46.940]  We posted for free the moment it was finished.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.059]  But in that film, you have testimony from former U.S. Air Force generals.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:07:01.239]  Former government scientists, former U.S. presidential cabinet members, former Canadian Minister of Defense, all acknowledging these programs exist and are ongoing.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:10.559]  And so I would argue again, Alex, that this is the greatest and most immediate threat we collectively face, short of nuclear cataclysm, because we cannot hide from it.
[01:07:10.639 --> 01:07:13.719]  It's destroying the Earth's life support systems, contaminating every breath we take.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:30.409]  And even in regard to nuclear cataclysm, we have a connection here, because the destruction being done to the atmosphere It has now made us more vulnerable to coronal mass ejections, solar flare, and if we have a major event like the Carrington event now that shuts down power grids around the globe,
[01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:36.670]  we're going to have nuclear power plants that can't cool themselves, we're going to have dozens if not hundreds of Fukishimas, game over.
[01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:43.110]  So from every conceivable direction, what's happening in our skies holds our collective futures in the balance, Alex.
[01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:50.800]  We know Trump was kept out of all the different compartmentalized areas of the government.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:57.099]  That's why they're so upset, because now he knows, and it's said with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he knows how to get in there, and he's going to release all this information.
[01:07:57.099 --> 01:07:58.219]  Can you speak to that?
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:08.539]  Yes, I certainly have high hopes for Robert, that he will be able to make headway with this issue.
[01:08:08.699 --> 01:08:10.940]  We're in communication with them again now.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.559]  I've done an hour interview with Robert.
[01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:20.810]  I'm thankful for his courage for addressing this issue, and we are scheduled to do another interview very soon.
[01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:33.670]  And once we put a break in the dam, and again, thanks to your voice, thanks to Robert's voice and others, very important that we all stand together on this issue.
[01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:45.060]  But if we put a big enough break in the dam, Alex, that they can't plug We will indeed cause a shockwave around the world as we awaken populations to what their government has been and is doing to them without their knowledge and consent.
[01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.760]  And this, again, goes back decades, Alice.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.840]  We have in Africa, for example, they've been cutting off precipitation.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:58.619]  The country's there for decades, bringing those countries to their knees and the populations and thus forcing those countries to allow U.S. occupation on their soil.
[01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:09.859]  If we look at the post 9-11, Alex, I'm sure you remember General Wesley Clark has a list of countries that were to be targeted immediately after 9-11.
[01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.859]  That list clearly existed before the event ever occurred.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.680]  Every one of those countries in the Middle East subsequently endured a once in 1,000 year drought.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.399]  Mathematically, statistically, that's impossible to have that kind of coincidence without climate intervention.
[01:09:22.739 --> 01:09:24.239]  And we have countries like Iraq.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:31.119]  Stating on the record, on the floor of the UN, on film, on the record, the leader of that country, that their reign was being systematically cut off.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:51.340]  We see the same exact operations cutting the reign off to the Western US. So for those people that think our country, our government, that's literally a criminal cabal masquerading as a legitimate government, if American citizens think that they're any more important to these controllers than the Iraqis or anybody else,
[01:09:51.949 --> 01:09:52.970]  Or the Iranians?
[01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:54.670]  Think again. Think again.
[01:09:54.810 --> 01:10:08.729]  So the bottom line is there's so much undeniable data that this is going on, and we can speculate about all the agendas and objectives, but the fact that the American citizens are being subjected to the same weather warfare as the Iranians and others around the world is indisputable.
