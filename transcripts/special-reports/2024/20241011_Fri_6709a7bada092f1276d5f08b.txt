[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339]  As predicted, the Democrats are bringing back mask mandates.
[00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.179]  We're about to break down what's coming next, straight ahead.
[00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.000]  Mask mandates are coming back to several Bay Area counties.
[00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:19.620]  Health officials have issued orders requiring face masks to be worn in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other healthcare facilities.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.160]  This order goes into effect starting November 1, Until either the end of March or April 2025.
[00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:33.520]  Now the counties requiring masks right now are Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Napa County.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:53.520]  As I told you, my sources inside the Border Patrol and the TSA told me, and then months later the documents came out, that the Biden-Harris administration has been planning to try to bring back mask mandates.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.799]  Now, already in Europe and the UK and Australia and New Zealand, they're trying it as well.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.400]  They're using the PCR test that they turn up 30 to 40 times what it's supposed to be set at.
[00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.939]  To then get a lot of false positives supposedly for COVID. They then use that number to create fear.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.079]  Then the mask is the symbol of fear.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.000]  It's the symbol of their party, the symbol of their submission to medical tyranny.
[00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.400]  Just like the Nazis had their armband.
[00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.489]  It's a symbol of their party, the party of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the UN treaty that just failed to pass that would take over our bodies two months ago.
[00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.730]  But regardless, the Biden-Harris administration has been instrumental in writing the treaty that literally lets Big Pharma and the UN take over our bodies.
[00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.790]  So why are they bringing it back now?
[00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.819]  Again, it creates fear.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.340]  They can then condition the public to take their tenth shot or their ninth booster.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.500]  It's about profits for big pharma.
[00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.959]  And now we know what the FDA warned of in October of 2000 is true.
[00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.359]  It causes massive heart problems, myocarditis, strokes, blood clots, and by your third shot...
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.459]  Your white blood cells are turned off.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.060]  It doesn't kill them. They just stop destroying viruses and bacteria.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.520]  So right on time of the election, we see them rolling this out in select counties in California and other areas of New York state.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.599]  In New York, the governor's proposed passing a law that will allow them to arrest anybody they want and quarantine you for any reason.
[00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.360]  The same thing is happening in Australia as well.
[00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:46.069]  That's why we have to continue to expose the crimes the last four and a half years with the COVID tyranny and bring these criminals to justice with Nuremberg too, so they don't bring this system of control back, which they admit is instrumental in a world ID for the central bank digital currency.
[00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.930]  At the heart of it, a social credit score enforced through the vaccine passports.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.639]  They also want internet IDs they're trying to pass in Congress and around the world right now so they can turn off your internet access if you don't submit to them.
[00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.520]  The technocracy is going into place right now.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:16.879]  But illegal aliens, they don't have to take the shots because they're precious migrants, because the UN even told Reuters they were worried about the liability of the migrants getting sick from the shots, but citizens are supposed to take them.
[00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:37.689]  And again, whether you're in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK, Canada, the US, it's the exact same COVID policies worldwide because the UN is getting its policies from the Bill of Melinda Gates Foundation on record and the Bill of Melinda Gates Foundation has set the standards globally for the new world ID that again will enforce the social credit score.
[00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:51.330]  We're good to go.
[00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:03.409]  That's why it's important we continue to speak out and continue to expose this tyranny because together, the outrageous, ridiculous nature of their lies will not stand.
[00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.750]  They said it didn't come out of a lab.
[00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.189]  COVID did. They then said that these mRNA injections would supposedly protect us.
[00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:13.689]  They don't. They make you get COVID more often.
[00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.509]  They erase your immune system.
[00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.269]  The whole thing was a lie.
[00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.870]  They were the disinformation. They were the frauds.
[00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.370]  And we were the ones that told the truth.
[00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.649]  Please share this report.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:33.699]  And please follow us on Exit Relox Jones and please support us at this critical time because the deep state has listed Infowars in the entire media worldwide as public enemy number one.
[00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.600]  They're trying to shut down right now.
[00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.379]  Now please share this report.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.980]  The globalist deep state just took their war on free speech and our very identities and our very freedoms to the next level.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:06.620]  They have now introduced a lawsuit against me where they literally claim they own my name, my social media, and me personally in violation of the 13th Amendment that we fought the Civil War over.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.420]  They're actually saying I'm an indentured servant, that I am a slave.
[00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm always the canary in the coal mine.
[00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:15.850]  I am the test case.
[00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.250]  When they get through me, they're coming after you.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.579]  They're not just saying they own me.
[00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:42.899]  They've also filed in federal court and also in the state court saying they own the name Alex Jones and that they own real Alex Jones on X. Now, the courts have all said you can't do things like that, but they're trying it, and if I don't aggressively battle them in the state and federal court,
[00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.740]  they will get a win if I don't challenge it, and then they'll be able to use that tactic on you as well.
[00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.649]  And in the words of President Trump, when that bullet grazed his ear, defiantly rising up and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.649]  That's how we fight in the information war, winning hearts and minds.
[00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.870]  And we're unstoppable if you simply decide to take action.
[00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:11.550]  So for all your word of mouth, all your prayers, and all your support over the years, I salute all of you and remind you that you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:12.810]  You are the resistance.
[00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.610]  You are the people.
[00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:23.839]  And I am so proud to have been working with all of you through the years, and now the fight is entering the most intense part of the phase, so let's redouble our efforts and let's win this thing!
[00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.259]  Or we can roll over and be slaves to the New World Order.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.139]  As for me, I'll quote Patrick Henry.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.740]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.500]  And I'll quote Colonel Travis the Alamo.
[00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.079]  Victory or death!
[00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.600]  RealAxShones.com. TheAxShonesStore.com.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.160]  Back me and I'll never surrender.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.160]  People should not be walking around with masks.
[00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.620]  Let me just state for the record that masks are not theater.
[00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:54.420]  Wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better.
[00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:55.740]  Masks are protective.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.199]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:08.600]  There has not been any indication that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable period of time has any deleterious effects.
[00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.899]  There are unintended consequences.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.759]  People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
[00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.050]  And can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there?
[00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.509]  Of course. You do not need to wear a mask indoors if, in fact, you've been vaccinated.
[00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.829]  Good that you're vaccinated, but in a situation where you have people indoors, particularly crowded, you should wear a mask.
[00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:32.329]  So even if you are vaccinated, you should wear a mask.
[00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:39.089]  If, in fact, you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, you are protected, and you do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors.
[00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.910]  When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks.
[00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:52.850]  You know, if you look at children outside, particularly when they're with the family, walking down the street, playing a game or what have you, don't have to wear a mask.
[00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:01.230]  The pediatric, the Academy of Pediatrics actually makes that recommendation that children should be wearing masks from two years old.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.939]  Onward. And you're asking now, if your child is a member of your household, can you walk outdoors with your child without a mask?
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.860]  According to that chart, the answer is yes.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.459]  But the child can't, not to beat it to death.
[00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:19.000]  Yes, yes. Because now the CDC says, I mean, I think I've got this right.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.319]  One mask is better than zero masks.
[00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.500]  Two masks is better than one mask.
[00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:25.500]  But you don't have to have double masks.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.060]  Is that right? I mean...
[00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:34.179]  It became clear that cloth coverings that you didn't have to buy in a store that you could make yourself were adequate.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.120]  And then you want it to fit better.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:48.059]  So one of the ways you could do it if you would like to is put a cloth mask over, which actually here and here and here where you could get leakage in is much better contained.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.700]  Are you a double masker, Dr.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.259]  Fauci? Look like you are.
[00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:55.759]  Scientific studies before this pandemic I've shown that low-cost masks.
[00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:59.259]  So we're talking about surgical masks and the cough masks we're wearing.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.120]  These low-cost masks have pore sizes that range between 80 and 500 microns in size.
[00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.460]  So a huge range, right? The diameter of the virus is one micron.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:17.360]  The largest possible small droplet that provides a typical aerosol and two viral particles is 62 microns in diameter.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.600]  So let's talk about that in perspective.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.759]  The smallest pore size is 80.
[00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.570]  So that means the largest droplet coated with the virus can pass right through.
[00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.429]  You can find masks, you're three-ply surgical masks, so 15 layers, and you're going to seal it around the mouth.
[00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:34.549]  If this is true, the ear cells come through, then this should fog up.
[00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.190]  We'll see. Masks.
[00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:43.389]  They had appeared to be a thing of the past, but have you noticed more and more people are covering up as we get deeper into the holiday season?
[00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:49.389]  Coming off Thanksgiving and more people getting sick in general, masks seem to be on a comeback.
[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.659]  These are fogs. Now, watch this.
[00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.860]  I made a cross. Can you see my eyes through that cross?
[00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:59.759]  There's so much moisture there that you can see.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.320]  Look at that cross pattern. There's so much moisture there.
[00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.740]  So, I'm not going to say any more, right?
[00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.480]  All I'm saying, I just went with the science.
[00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.970]  This is crazy. With a lot of people, I try to wear a mask because it's kind of...
[00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.330]  I don't like it. I don't enjoy it, but I don't want to get sick.
[00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.889]  I was ready to stop wearing this one until that new strain came out, the one with the strange name.
[00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:24.789]  Dr. Shira Durone is the epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.
[00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.370]  She says there is an uptick in COVID and all respiratory viruses.
[00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.190]  Dr. Durone says masks have now become an important tool for staying healthy.
[00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:41.210]  What we have learned from the pandemic is that people can choose to protect themselves with a high quality well-fitting mask.
