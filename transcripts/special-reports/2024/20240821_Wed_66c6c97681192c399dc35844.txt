[00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.425]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.287]  This is our town.
[00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:28.172]  We've got steel in our spines, iron in our veins, and hope in our hearts.
[00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.536]  We've got the flavor, the guts, the grit, and those big shoulders you've heard so much about.
[00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:37.479]  We're Bold City.
[00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:38.860]  A proud city.
[00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.543]  A who you calling second city?
[00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:44.286]  Where 77 neighborhoods are one.
[00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:46.048]  A city of giants.
[00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:47.808]  A city with heart.
[00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.829]  A city with heroes.
[00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.391]  A sweet, sweet place to call home.
[00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.432]  We were born ready.
[00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.813]  Baptized by fire.
[00:00:56.893 --> 00:00:57.493]  Tireless.
[00:00:57.853 --> 00:00:58.514]  Tenacious.
[00:00:58.894 --> 00:00:59.874]  Tested.
[00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:00.435]  Trusted.
[00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:05.119]  And like someone else we know, when we fight, we win.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.543]  We're ready to rise to the challenge, to rise to new heights.
[00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:12.646]  Rise, rise, rise.
[00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:14.748]  Up, up, and away we go.
[00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:19.573]  Hey, make some noise so we can hear you, America!
[00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:24.077]  Welcome to Chicago!
[00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:31.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:39.204]  I am your host, Chase Geiser, joined by the wonderful and talented and amazing Maria Z. It is an honor and a pleasure to be sharing the stage with you tonight.
[00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:40.285]  Thank you so much, Chase.
[00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:44.530]  It's great to be here covering the Democratic National Catastrophe.
[00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.631]  It's exactly what it is.
[00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.473]  I like to call it the DNCCP because it's basically a celebration of Maoism all around.
[00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.976]  Folks, we have an amazing interview between Alex Jones and Donald Trump that we're going to air for you.
[00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:58.278]  This is from December 2nd of 2015, fairly early in the primary process back then.
[00:01:58.338 --> 00:02:01.821]  So it's just so cool to be here and to see this and have these throwback clips.
[00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:06.524]  We're going to show this for about 25 or 30 minutes or so, and then we're going to get right into coverage of the DNC this evening.
[00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:06.964]  Go ahead, guys.
[00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:10.032]  There's so many things to do, Alex.
[00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:11.413]  We will do such a good job.
[00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:12.413]  There's so many fronts.
[00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:14.955]  A number will win on trade.
[00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:16.676]  We're going to strengthen our military.
[00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.956]  We're going to take care of our vets.
[00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:19.357]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.738]  We're going to do so many things.
[00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:22.239]  There's so many things that can be done.
[00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.227]  Donald Trump is our guest.
[00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.388]  Donald, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:32.649]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:33.229]  Great.
[00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:34.210]  Great to be with you.
[00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.536]  I've got so many questions, but you are vindicated—this has got to be the 50th time in the last six months—on the radical Muslims celebrating, not just in New Jersey, but New York.
[00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.377]  Palestine all over.
[00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:46.438]  What do you have to say?
[00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:52.622]  They're still attacking you, though we've got Dan Rather on video, we've got New York Post, we've got Washington Post.
[00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:53.483]  What's going on here?
[00:02:53.623 --> 00:03:00.808]  Well, I took a lot of heat, and I was very strong on it, and I held my line, and then all of a sudden, you know, hundreds of people were calling up my office.
[00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:06.612]  I was the other day in Sarasota, Florida, and people are in line, and we had 12,000 people, which is fantastic.
[00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:10.795]  And the people were saying, many of the people from New Jersey, four or five people said,
[00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:12.756]  Mr. Trump, I saw it myself.
[00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:13.397]  I was there.
[00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:14.598]  They talked about Patterson.
[00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.740]  But they said, I saw it myself, Mr. Trump.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.361]  I was there.
[00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.423]  So I knew it happened, and I held my line.
[00:03:19.463 --> 00:03:23.166]  And people wanted me to apologize, and we can't do that.
[00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:24.988]  People like you and I can't do that so easily.
[00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.170]  Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex.
[00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.931]  You apologize.
[00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.232]  I'd apologize if I was wrong.
[00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:33.616]  But they were celebrating, and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center.
[00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:34.797]  I think that's disgraceful.
[00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:35.417]  It is.
[00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:49.822]  And that same week you were reporting on that fact, we had two different international football games, soccer games, with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing.
[00:03:50.122 --> 00:03:50.702]  So did that
[00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:51.682]  Not happened too?
[00:03:52.203 --> 00:03:53.824]  Well, that happened and everybody saw it.
[00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:57.185]  That was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it.
[00:03:57.225 --> 00:03:57.886]  They were embarrassed.
[00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:58.726]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:01.688]  The coach and the managers, they all apologized, but it happened.
[00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.529]  Look, we have to deal with reality.
[00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.631]  And you know, it all started because I said, we need surveillance.
[00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:07.991]  We need proper surveillance.
[00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:15.295]  We have people that truly are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from, at least the vicinity.
[00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.677]  And I said, we need proper surveillance because
[00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:25.182]  We're not going to have a country anymore between the weak borders that we have, the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it.
[00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:29.926]  And our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country.
[00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.287]  That's our number one problem.
[00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:43.116]  It's now in mainstream news, Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret deal with Turkey, with the Germans, with Merkel, the admitted socialist, to bring in millions
[00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.057]  of radical Islamists.
[00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:48.859]  They admit almost all of them are Sunni that basically invaded Syria.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.762]  They're getting their butt kicked by the Russians so now they want to flee up to the north into Turkey.
[00:04:54.243 --> 00:05:00.246]  You said months ago bomb the oil of ISIS and the mainstream media laughed because you said the sky was blue again.
[00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:07.211]  Now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do and now you've come out saying quote it looks like
[00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.873]  That Turkey's on the side of ISIS, close quote.
[00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:26.422]  Well, the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals connected to Irgun, the president's son, making billions of dollars total off of this.
[00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:28.904]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue.
[00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:30.405]  Well, I was right about that.
[00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:43.331]  I was right in saying in a book that I wrote—you covered it really nicely, I appreciate it—but I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, The America We Deserve, and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden.
[00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:44.712]  I mean, I really study this stuff.
[00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.153]  I really find it very interesting.
[00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:50.775]  And I wrote in the book 2000, two years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden.
[00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:51.655]  You better take him out.
[00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.196]  I said he's going to crawl under a rock.
[00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.477]  You better take him out.
[00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:56.638]  And now people are seeing that.
[00:05:56.658 --> 00:06:00.441]  They're saying, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true.
[00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:04.764]  And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center with the oil.
[00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.004]  And I'm glad you brought it up.
[00:06:06.044 --> 00:06:11.608]  But as you know, for three years, I've been saying, you better take out the oil, because if you don't take the oil, it's going to be a problem.
[00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.129]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq.
[00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.233]  But once we got there, the way we came out was horrible.
[00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:19.574]  And I said, take the oil.
[00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:26.018]  Then we didn't take the oil, so ISIS got the oil, and as you know, Iran is getting the oil, because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq.
[00:06:26.778 --> 00:06:35.384]  You know, we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them $150 billion, and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons.
[00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.286]  The more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing.
[00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:41.608]  You were the only leading American figure
[00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:44.610]  Who openly said do not go to war in Iraq.
[00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.594]  They had almost, what, 90% votes in Congress for it, bipartisan.
[00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.216]  You said don't do it, Iran will take over.
[00:06:51.696 --> 00:07:02.205]  I mean, look, you can say that today and everybody can say that, but you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003, when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good advisors.
[00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:04.988]  How did you know that when almost no one else did?
[00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:09.329]  I have to tell you, you have to know, if you're going to go to war, you have to do it properly, and you have to know what to do.
[00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:15.611]  I viewed it as this, Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength, and they're constantly fighting.
[00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:17.011]  That's all they do is they fight, right?
[00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:24.273]  They go to war all the time, and they'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right, 10 feet left, then they'd rest, and then they'd start it again four years later.
[00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:25.974]  This has been going on for years.
[00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:27.354]  Forever.
[00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:28.475]  And this is the way it is.
[00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:34.360]  I said, if you take out Iran, or if you take out Iraq, either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.401]  Well, we took out Iraq.
[00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:40.364]  And by the way, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:41.405]  People don't even know that.
[00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:50.012]  And I said, and you'll know this, and you know this, and I appreciate what you just said, then Iran is going to come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq.
[00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.313]  And they're just taking it over right now.
[00:07:52.353 --> 00:07:53.574]  As we speak, they're taking it over.
[00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:58.317]  Iran is running a rack and very soon will be virtually, gonna be totally running a rack.
[00:07:58.497 --> 00:08:00.198]  So, I said keep the oil.
[00:08:01.124 --> 00:08:03.526]  And I said, if you're going to leave, you shouldn't have gone in.
[00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.729]  But they should have left soldiers behind, like 20,000 or a certain number of soldiers.
[00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:09.690]  But if you're going to leave, take the oil.
[00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.451]  And I've said it.
[00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:11.872]  Then they left.
[00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:12.732]  They didn't take the oil.
[00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.073]  So ISIS got the oil.
[00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:15.474]  Iran is getting the oil.
[00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:16.915]  Everybody's getting everything but us.
[00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:18.877]  So we lost thousands of soldiers.
[00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:20.057]  We spent $2 trillion in Iraq.
[00:08:21.258 --> 00:08:23.439]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place.
[00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:24.899]  And what do we get out of it, Alex?
[00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:25.720]  We get nothing!
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.500]  We have nothing.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.661]  No, the French and the Germans are getting the oil and the Iranians are getting the oil.
[00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:32.082]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is?
[00:08:32.342 --> 00:08:32.802]  Guess what?
[00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:33.302]  China.
[00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:33.983]  That's right.
[00:08:34.163 --> 00:08:35.303]  How smart is China?
[00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:38.004]  They outsmart us on every level, militarily.
[00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:39.785]  They outsmart us on trade.
[00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.766]  You're a top business guy, you know, on your own, from nothing.
[00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:48.528]  How did China get 97% of rare earth minerals in the world?
[00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:55.271]  How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes in the smartphones, the computers, trillions is made a year?
[00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:57.932]  How did we just give them the global market in that?
[00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:58.572]  That's crazy.
[00:08:58.793 --> 00:09:00.873]  Well, what a lot of people don't know, Afghanistan.
[00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:06.296]  Now, Afghanistan is a place we can go in because, you know, you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons, a lot of things going on there.
[00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:11.740]  We go into Afghanistan, we're fighting, you know, tremendous mountains and ridges.
[00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:16.265]  We're fighting on one side, and you know who's got their excavators on the other side?
[00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:17.566]  China, taking out all the minerals.
[00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:21.850]  You know, Afghanistan, nobody knew this, Afghanistan is rich with minerals.
[00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.971]  Not oil, but minerals.
[00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:23.892]  Lithium, everything.
[00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:26.516]  And China has taken out all the minerals.
[00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:27.777]  And here we are fighting.
[00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:32.420]  We have trillions, like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan, and we get nothing out of it.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.322]  And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
[00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:37.223]  We get nothing.
[00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:39.344]  China has taken out the minerals.
[00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:47.449]  They're the buyers, the big buyers at very, very low prices of, as you know, of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria.
[00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:49.030]  But China is a big buyer of the oil.
[00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.792]  But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it,
[00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:55.654]  For three years I've been saying, hit the oil because ISIS is getting stronger.
[00:09:55.674 --> 00:09:59.397]  They know JV, as the president said, and they're certainly not contained.
[00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:02.179]  But I said, hit the oil and hit them hard.
[00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:03.740]  And they laughed at me.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.682]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[00:10:07.702 --> 00:10:09.684]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil.
[00:10:10.124 --> 00:10:10.764]  And it does work.
[00:10:10.804 --> 00:10:13.426]  The problem is we've given them a two-year edge.
[00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:14.607]  They have billions of dollars.
[00:10:14.627 --> 00:10:18.249]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month and ISIS is already rolling over.
[00:10:18.549 --> 00:10:20.571]  So Putin is following your strategy.
[00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:22.152]  You know Vladimir Putin well.
[00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:24.613]  Two years ago, Alex, that's the only problem.
[00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:25.854]  Donald Trump joins us live.
[00:10:25.874 --> 00:10:32.837]  Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin?
[00:10:32.857 --> 00:10:36.779]  Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:38.992]  I think I get along great with people.
[00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:43.133]  I mean, I will probably get along well with him, and if I don't, somebody else will, and who knows?
[00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:44.433]  You know, he's a difficult cookie.
[00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:45.993]  He's tough and he's smart.
[00:10:46.334 --> 00:10:47.894]  I think I'd get along very well with him.
[00:10:47.934 --> 00:10:49.034]  I think it'd do fine.
[00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:50.414]  Look, here's the thing.
[00:10:50.794 --> 00:10:53.595]  We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.795]  China is killing us.
[00:10:54.975 --> 00:10:56.015]  Everybody's killing us.
[00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.236]  China's just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[00:10:58.296 --> 00:11:02.116]  Japan, Mexico is killing us, and yet we don't get along with anybody.
[00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:04.097]  With me, they're not gonna get so rich.
[00:11:04.177 --> 00:11:06.117]  Believe me, they're not gonna get so rich at all.
[00:11:06.397 --> 00:11:07.578]  We're going to take back our jobs.
[00:11:07.598 --> 00:11:09.159]  We're going to take back our manufacture.
[00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:10.180]  We take back our base.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.502]  But they'll like us more than they do now.
[00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:14.307]  Sort of amazing.
[00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:18.889]  You definitely have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems.
[00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:30.133]  Hillary and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9-11, but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia, in the air, on the ground.
[00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:31.693]  They have video of it all.
[00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:32.454]  None of it happened.
[00:11:32.494 --> 00:11:33.514]  She admits she lied.
[00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.275]  If you did that, you'd be done.
[00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:36.575]  But you wouldn't do something like that.
[00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:38.556]  You don't steal glory from our veterans.
[00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:48.927]  But they demonize you for made-up scandals every day, trying to see what'll stick, and then you got Hillary involved in Benghazi, you've got them involved in everything, and people love you for tough talk.
[00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:51.750]  Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama?
[00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.875]  I mean, what do we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
[00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.156]  Well, you remember this.
[00:11:57.556 --> 00:12:01.400]  The best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left, okay?
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.443]  Because, you know, by the time you do the hearings and everything, I don't... So don't make him a martyr.
[00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.425]  In a way, you'll make him a martyr, but I don't even say that.
[00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:17.613]  You know, one of the things I'm... I'm the most disappointed in Republicans, because they go to Washington, they're gonna do all this stuff, they're gonna impeach Obama, they're gonna end Obamacare, which has to be ended.
[00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:18.154]  It's a disaster.
[00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:19.875]  I don't know if you've seen the premiums they're going up.
[00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:20.696]  It's killing everything!
[00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:24.719]  55%.
[00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:24.719]  You know, it's going to implode anyway.
[00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:28.782]  In 2017, Obamacare blows up.
[00:12:28.862 --> 00:12:29.282]  It's over.
[00:12:29.443 --> 00:12:29.963]  I mean, it's over.
[00:12:30.003 --> 00:12:30.864]  And everybody knows it.
[00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.325]  And they're doing big stories.
[00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:35.467]  Even the ones that were for it are saying, uh-oh, this isn't working.
[00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:37.289]  Well, the premiums are a disaster.
[00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:41.272]  And if you look at anything having to do with Obamacare right now, it's over.
[00:12:41.812 --> 00:12:45.115]  But the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it.
[00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:47.537]  They'll try instead of get rid of it.
[00:12:47.678 --> 00:12:50.901]  And we can come up with a phenomenal plan that's much better for the people.
[00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:52.362]  The people are getting killed with that.
[00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:55.325]  So there's so many things to do, Alex.
[00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:56.766]  We will do such a good job.
[00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:57.747]  There's so many fronts.
[00:12:58.268 --> 00:13:00.310]  A number will win on trade.
[00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.031]  We're going to strengthen our military.
[00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:03.312]  We're going to take care of our vets.
[00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:04.754]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:13:05.074 --> 00:13:06.075]  We're going to do so many things.
[00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:07.616]  There's so many things that can be done.
[00:13:08.076 --> 00:13:09.357]  But we have to use our good people.
[00:13:09.617 --> 00:13:18.423]  You know, everybody running against me, in terms of even the Republican side, and Hillary certainly, they're all controlled by their donors and their special interests and the lobbyists.
[00:13:18.863 --> 00:13:19.884]  I'm putting up my own money.
[00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.084]  I'm funding my own campaign.
[00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:22.125]  Nobody's going to control me.
[00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:25.067]  I'm going to do what's right for you and for the American people.
[00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:26.268]  Listen, I get it.
[00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:27.869]  I mean, you are a true maverick.
[00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:28.710]  I understand.
[00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.072]  You know, you've made tens of billions of dollars.
[00:13:31.092 --> 00:13:32.654]  You've hired tens of thousands of people.
[00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:38.599]  I mean, I would imagine that as you've gotten older, correct me if I'm wrong, because I know you talked about wanting to serve America decades ago.
[00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:43.063]  Really, all it comes down to is wanting to have a free country for your children and grandchildren.
[00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:44.805]  And that's where I want to come to this point next.
[00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:54.052]  Because I know you're smart, sir, and I know that you also, though, you don't dumb your message down, but you keep it at a mid-level so the general public and the establishment as well can get it.
[00:13:54.072 --> 00:13:55.233]  But let's get down to brass tacks.
[00:13:55.914 --> 00:14:06.783]  I routinely talk to the top generals, special forces, Pentagon currently, out of the Pentagon, CIA, as I know you do, and we'll just leave it at that.
[00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:11.583]  There are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country.
[00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:17.144]  They really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done as a third world nation within a few more years.
[00:14:17.384 --> 00:14:19.985]  Forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens, we're done.
[00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:21.945]  I mean, we're talking about resurrecting the dead here.
[00:14:22.205 --> 00:14:26.066]  We could turn it around right now, as you've said properly, you're dead on, sir, you're right.
[00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:28.627]  We could turn it around, all the actuaries, all the numbers show it.
[00:14:28.887 --> 00:14:30.487]  But it's got to happen in the next few years or we're done.
[00:14:31.107 --> 00:14:39.119]  And there are globalists that want to have a world government, a system run by select crony capitalists, using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:46.290]  And I've talked to not just high level folks that have been in government that are on your team, but separately high level people in government currently,
[00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.773]  Let's say there's an internal war going on and that you're a manifestation of that.
[00:14:50.894 --> 00:14:58.640]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.162]  It's George Washington level and you understand that office.
[00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:13.172]  Speak about the war for the soul of this country that's happening right now and really tell people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross Perot under death threats and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election.
[00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:19.597]  OK, so let me just tell you, Alex, as you know, I'm leading in every poll nationally in every poll state.
[00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:23.601]  I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, the SEC, Texas.
[00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.703]  I'm leading in Texas, which I love.
[00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:26.684]  I love Texas.
[00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:27.365]  You know, we were there.
[00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:28.526]  Mark Cuban called up.
[00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:29.647]  He said, do you want to use the arena?
[00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:30.027]  I used it.
[00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:32.409]  We filled it up in three or four days, 20,000 people.
[00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.471]  In Mobile, Alabama, we had 35,000 people.
[00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:35.132]  We had 20,000 in Oklahoma.
[00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:43.740]  I'm so into this, and I'm not into, you know, I could do other things that I would enjoy doing, to be honest with you.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.940]  No, you're doing a dangerous mission.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.621]  We understand that.
[00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:46.941]  It's not an easy thing.
[00:15:47.382 --> 00:15:49.043]  But the key is make America great again.
[00:15:49.223 --> 00:15:57.768]  We can make America great again, but if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what's gone on in the past and, you know, what's going, it's just, we're being eaten away.
[00:15:58.428 --> 00:16:01.090]  It's just, it's eating away at our country.
[00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.155]  And we can make, in my opinion, we can make America greater than ever before.
[00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.537]  But we have to get going.
[00:16:07.597 --> 00:16:08.418]  It has to happen.
[00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:09.339]  We have to get going.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.523]  And, you know, when you look at the vision, I said Iraq.
[00:16:12.863 --> 00:16:14.385]  You agreed with me on Iraq.
[00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:15.767]  I said hit the oil.
[00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:17.789]  I said a lot of things that turned out to be
[00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.870]  True.
[00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.891]  A hundred percent true.
[00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:22.253]  And I'm giving credit, I'm giving credit by some people.
[00:16:22.313 --> 00:16:23.714]  Some people refuse to acknowledge it.
[00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:24.955]  You know, they refuse to say.
[00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:27.277]  No, you've been, you've been, you've been absolutely on target.
[00:16:27.297 --> 00:16:30.760]  So what I'm asking is though, can you speak to the crossroads we're at right now though?
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.580]  Because you've talked about it.
[00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:35.664]  Are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country's done or whether we go to the next level?
[00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:43.348]  Well, I think this, I think that, sadly, I think that if we don't get it right this time, I think this is going to be the most important election our country's ever had.
[00:16:43.388 --> 00:16:47.690]  I mean, you'd have to say George Washington was right there, you know, the couple of pretty important elections, right?
[00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:53.294]  But this is certainly in the last, in the modern era, this is the most important election our country's ever had.
[00:16:53.854 --> 00:17:00.658]  If we don't get it right, if we put another one of these people in, like Hillary, I mean, she's so corrupt.
[00:17:01.218 --> 00:17:03.960]  She is so corrupt, and she shouldn't even be allowed to run.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.544]  And frankly, her greatest legacy, she was a horrible Secretary of State.
[00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:14.029]  If she runs, I think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal.
[00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:14.710]  That's what I think.
[00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.953]  It'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal.
[00:17:19.494 --> 00:17:24.838]  Because General Petraeus and many others, I mean, their lives have been destroyed for doing 5% of what she did.
[00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:25.419]  That's right.
[00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:26.420]  She shouldn't be allowed to run.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.687]  But, you know, the recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has me beating her head-to-head, which is very interesting and very good, and beating her soundly head-to-head.
[00:17:35.107 --> 00:17:37.449]  But we have to get it right.
[00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:40.631]  Our country can be absolutely, we can turn it around.
[00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:52.101]  But I would agree with you, if we don't get it right this time, I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of these leaders, I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore.
[00:17:52.121 --> 00:17:53.222]  I think it could be for sure.
[00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:57.808]  I understand that you really do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren live, but let's expand on this.
[00:17:58.749 --> 00:18:02.954]  There are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with Bill Clinton.
[00:18:04.236 --> 00:18:09.038]  And so, you know, you had to do business in New York, so you said nice things about Hillary.
[00:18:09.358 --> 00:18:11.899]  I get keeping your enemies closer when you're not, you know, in politics.
[00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:12.259]  I get it.
[00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:13.160]  I understand.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.960]  I think that's what you did.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:27.325]  But promise us that you're not going to drop out at the key moment, keeping all the other Republicans out of view, and then Hillary races to the head, or Jeb Bush does, because as you know, folks are claiming you're a Clinton operative.
[00:18:27.825 --> 00:18:28.866]  You know, I've never heard that.
[00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:34.549]  I heard it actually a few months ago, but I've hit her harder than anybody times ten, if you look at this.
[00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:35.449]  You have, you have.
[00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.510]  I was a businessman.
[00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.331]  You know, I've only been a politician for five months.
[00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:41.493]  I hate to use the term because, you know, it's all... You're a statesman.
[00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:43.974]  But I've just been doing this for a very short period of time.
[00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:45.335]  I was establishment.
[00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:52.118]  You know, I was like, a guy like you would say, Trump is total establishment, and I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans.
[00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.660]  But over the years, I've given to Democrats, I've given to Republicans, I've given to everybody.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.461]  Because I had an obligation.
[00:18:57.561 --> 00:18:58.461]  I was a businessman.
[00:18:58.661 --> 00:19:01.142]  One of the magazines recently called me a world-class businessman.
[00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:01.903]  The truth is, I did.
[00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:03.984]  I built an unbelievable company.
[00:19:04.584 --> 00:19:05.664]  Tremendous assets.
[00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:07.986]  Tremendous, not only that, iconic assets.
[00:19:08.306 --> 00:19:09.026]  Very little debt.
[00:19:09.086 --> 00:19:10.107]  Tremendous cash flow.
[00:19:10.147 --> 00:19:10.867]  It's a great company.
[00:19:11.147 --> 00:19:15.390]  And by the way, people now see how good, when I did the filing, everyone said, oh, he'll never file, he'll never file.
[00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.573]  It's almost 100 pages long, and it's an unbelievable company.
[00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:24.076]  So I built it, which, by the way, the reason I say that, that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
[00:19:24.156 --> 00:19:26.017]  But I got along great with Clinton.
[00:19:26.317 --> 00:19:28.038]  I got along great with Harry Reid.
[00:19:28.338 --> 00:19:29.559]  I got along great with everybody.
[00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:33.402]  Because when I needed them, I didn't want to have an argument.
[00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.503]  I didn't want to have somebody say, well, Clinton doesn't want it to happen.
[00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:36.364]  Sure, you're not a loser.
[00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:37.625]  You don't get in mindless fights.
[00:19:37.665 --> 00:19:39.006]  You move forward with your agenda.
[00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:43.191]  But now you see America in trouble, and you're, hey, that's all sideline now.
[00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:45.012]  Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump.
[00:19:45.253 --> 00:19:46.434]  He wants to work for America.
[00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:49.777]  Yeah, as a businessman, you couldn't have even functioned if you don't get along.
[00:19:49.797 --> 00:19:50.418]  No, I know, yeah.
[00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:53.400]  For example, in New York City, it's 95% Democrat.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.123]  I mean, if I didn't get along with the Democrats, I wouldn't have one vote.
[00:19:56.143 --> 00:20:01.407]  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, you did want the vice president, you know, a position that's come out decades ago behind the scenes.
[00:20:01.507 --> 00:20:02.768]  I mean, I know you're a Republican.
[00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:04.510]  What about libertarianism?
[00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.911]  What's your view of libertarianism?
[00:20:05.951 --> 00:20:10.615]  And then I want to ask you, who's your favorite president and who do you think your running mate might be?
[00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:11.576]  Folks, I think it's Ted Cruz.
[00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.658]  Well, I think that libertarianism is sort of interesting.
[00:20:14.678 --> 00:20:16.779]  There are certain things that I really like about it.
[00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:19.621]  But, you know, keeping government out as much as possible.
[00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:21.342]  We need government for protection.
[00:20:21.402 --> 00:20:22.202]  We have to protect.
[00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:24.984]  When you look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to destroy us.
[00:20:25.764 --> 00:20:28.426]  And, you know, the problem we have today, Alex, is the weaponry.
[00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:31.067]  If this were 100 years ago, I'd say forget about them.
[00:20:31.107 --> 00:20:31.868]  Let them keep fighting.
[00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:33.069]  They've been fighting all their lives.
[00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:34.169]  Let them keep fighting each other.
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:34.590]  Who cares?
[00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:40.775]  But the weaponry is so powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now protect.
[00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:42.457]  So that's a big part of government.
[00:20:42.897 --> 00:20:45.359]  So there's a certain common sense to certain elements.
[00:20:45.399 --> 00:20:50.004]  And I do very well with the libertarians, frankly, you know, because they sort of get it and they get me.
[00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:50.764]  But we need
[00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:54.208]  Bigger strength that I think the libertarians really want.
[00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:55.489]  And we need it.
[00:20:55.709 --> 00:20:56.630]  And we have to have it.
[00:20:56.931 --> 00:20:57.551]  We have to have it.
[00:20:57.591 --> 00:20:59.033]  If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.
[00:20:59.373 --> 00:21:01.275]  If we don't have borders, we're not going to have a country.
[00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:03.558]  As far as running mates, it's too soon to say.
[00:21:03.578 --> 00:21:06.461]  I actually respect a couple of people that are on the stage.
[00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:08.323]  Some of them I have absolutely no respect for.
[00:21:08.723 --> 00:21:10.984]  I mean, I think they're not very good at all at what they do.
[00:21:11.324 --> 00:21:12.444]  You look at what's going on.
[00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:16.225]  But I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with me.
[00:21:16.245 --> 00:21:21.626]  I have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country, you know, political people.
[00:21:21.666 --> 00:21:32.569]  I'll pick somebody I think that can really be a great vice president, who ultimately has to be a great president, because that's, you know, 90% of that function is, you know, if something bad happens, you've got to be a good president.
[00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:33.909]  You have to view it from that standpoint.
[00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:37.610]  And my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be Ronald Reagan.
[00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.290]  Liked him, I helped him.
[00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.111]  And by the way, he was a Democrat.
[00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:42.331]  A lot of people don't know.
[00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:43.211]  He was.
[00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:45.091]  A liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know.
[00:21:45.572 --> 00:21:50.833]  And he became a somewhat conservative, I wouldn't say the most conservative, but a somewhat conservative Republican.
[00:21:50.853 --> 00:21:52.073]  But he wanted to make America great.
[00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:53.493]  And he really did.
[00:21:53.533 --> 00:21:56.414]  He wanted to make, he had actually, let's make America great.
[00:21:56.434 --> 00:21:59.455]  That was his, and mine is, make America great again.
[00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:00.695]  So there's a little bit of a difference.
[00:22:01.095 --> 00:22:04.677]  My son, my son, you know, finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours.
[00:22:04.697 --> 00:22:05.398]  I mean, I liked you.
[00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:06.459]  Love Americana.
[00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:07.399]  You're pure Americana.
[00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:08.760]  But I'm still, you know, it was research.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.301]  But my 13-year-old son's really smart.
[00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:11.522]  He does a lot of research.
[00:22:11.542 --> 00:22:12.423]  He watches all the debates.
[00:22:12.463 --> 00:22:13.363]  He just really loves you.
[00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:16.025]  He is on cloud nine that you're here, Rex Jones.
[00:22:16.305 --> 00:22:20.228]  And it was his question, you know, which president was your favorite.
[00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:23.050]  But all time, all time, who's your favorite?
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.310]  Well, all time.
[00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:32.893]  I'd say Ronald Reagan, shorter term, I would say... Well, you know, you look at Lincoln, you look at Washington, you have to go with... They're the classics, right, Alex?
[00:22:32.913 --> 00:22:37.094]  You know, you think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the Lincolns and the Washingtons.
[00:22:37.114 --> 00:22:37.674]  I agree.
[00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:39.815]  As a man's man, George Washington was a badass.
[00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:42.033]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[00:22:42.173 --> 00:22:43.634]  I mean, that's what they say.
[00:22:43.674 --> 00:22:44.874]  They say he never told a lie.
[00:22:44.894 --> 00:22:46.215]  Let's hope that's true, okay?
[00:22:46.235 --> 00:22:47.856]  But George Washington was pretty good.
[00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:52.798]  But look, we had some great presidents, and we had some good presidents on the other side, too, in all fairness.
[00:22:52.858 --> 00:22:56.540]  But we will hopefully be right at the top of that list.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.582]  We're going to make the country so strong, and we're going to make it financially secure.
[00:23:00.802 --> 00:23:03.924]  We can't owe $21 trillion, because it's going to be that number.
[00:23:04.144 --> 00:23:05.946]  Well, we have to make our country rich again.
[00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:12.672]  You know, the other day I said to a woman, she came up to Mr. Trump at a big rally where we had 14,000 people and at the end she just sees me in a
[00:23:25.963 --> 00:23:33.968]  You know, signing autographs and stuff, and she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you 100%, but are you... This whole concept of making it rich, it sounds so crass.
[00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:49.559]  I said, you know what, it might sound crass, but if we don't make our nation rich again, if we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us, and if we don't take back our money, and if we don't, you know, balance up our budget, at least get it damn close and soon, we're not gonna have a nation anymore.
[00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:50.780]  You gotta wanna be on the top.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.200]  You gotta wanna be free.
[00:23:53.277 --> 00:23:54.218]  Or you're going to be slaves.
[00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:56.760]  Donald Trump's agreed to stay a few more minutes with us.
[00:23:58.382 --> 00:24:01.685]  And he brought up, you know, somebody that he wanted to thank on air that I want to thank on air.
[00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:03.087]  He came in here a month ago.
[00:24:03.127 --> 00:24:04.388]  He's been on all these big shows.
[00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:05.949]  Just an incredible guy.
[00:24:05.969 --> 00:24:09.653]  I was aware of who he was, a patriot fighting communism all over the world.
[00:24:10.013 --> 00:24:13.417]  Tell us, Mr. Trump, about Mr. Stone, who helped get this interview set up.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:22.362]  Well, Roger's a good guy, and he is a patriot, and believes strongly in a strong nation, a lot of the things that I believe in.
[00:24:22.442 --> 00:24:24.403]  And, you know, I see him all over television.
[00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:25.883]  People like Roger.
[00:24:25.903 --> 00:24:28.164]  He's a tough cookie, I will tell you that, but people like him.
[00:24:28.184 --> 00:24:31.565]  But he's been so loyal and so wonderful, and he is the one.
[00:24:31.605 --> 00:24:36.446]  He really wanted me to do this interview, and I'm doing it, and so we appreciate it, Roger.
[00:24:37.086 --> 00:24:39.827]  Well, I knew who he was, but then I did more research on him.
[00:24:39.867 --> 00:24:48.369]  This guy literally fought communists all over the world, ran big elections against the Soviet Union in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia.
[00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:52.270]  I mean, and I know he's been friends with you for a long time and advising you.
[00:24:52.290 --> 00:25:00.353]  So, again, my respect level went up even more knowing that you're talking to real political operatives, not fake pundits that are on TV.
[00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:01.573]  And that brings me to mainstream media.
[00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:04.434]  I love the fact, when I first saw it a few days ago,
[00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:06.444]  They misrepresented it.
[00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:07.785]  They said Trump wants $5 million.
[00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:08.947]  Then I read deeper.
[00:25:09.247 --> 00:25:13.692]  You said give $5 million to Wounded Warriors before I go make CNN $50 million.
[00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:14.793]  That's what you make these shows.
[00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:17.456]  You know, they took that statement.
[00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:18.737]  I said give $5 million.
[00:25:18.777 --> 00:25:22.401]  I'm going to want $5 million that we're going to give to the Wounded Warriors or the vets, right?
[00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:24.023]  Which is the same thing as far as I'm concerned.
[00:25:24.043 --> 00:25:24.683]  We split it up.
[00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:28.267]  Because they're making a fortune on these debates, which never had anybody.
[00:25:28.287 --> 00:25:30.009]  You know, Fox had 24 million people.
[00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.211]  They used to get like a million.
[00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:34.875]  And CNN had the biggest ratings in the history of CNN.
[00:25:35.295 --> 00:25:38.379]  And I won't take full credit, but I'll take 99.9% credit.
[00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.821]  So I said, give me $5 million.
[00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:42.443]  I want to give it to the Wounded Warriors.
[00:25:42.704 --> 00:25:43.484]  I want to give it to the vets.
[00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:46.606]  But a lot of people said Trump wants $5 million.
[00:25:46.786 --> 00:25:48.647]  And I said it right in the same sentence, Alex.
[00:25:48.687 --> 00:25:50.288]  I didn't say it like- That's completely deceived.
[00:25:50.969 --> 00:25:54.691]  I said, I want $5 million that will go to the Wounded Warriors.
[00:25:54.951 --> 00:25:55.751]  And they would play it.
[00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:56.712]  They even took the tape.
[00:25:56.732 --> 00:25:58.152]  You know, the tape is worse than the pen.
[00:25:58.172 --> 00:25:58.813]  They can cut it.
[00:25:59.253 --> 00:26:01.814]  So they say, give me $5 million, and then they cut it.
[00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:03.315]  Nobody knows, what am I doing?
[00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:04.916]  I'm asking for money to be on a debate.
[00:26:04.956 --> 00:26:05.656]  It's ridiculous.
[00:26:06.157 --> 00:26:10.199]  So I wanted $5 million to go to the Wounded Warriors in particular.
[00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:12.239]  Uh, let's see what happens.
[00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:12.780]  I don't know.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.701]  You know, the one problem, Alex, if I didn't go to the debate, then you know what would happen.
[00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:18.821]  They'd say he's chicken.
[00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:20.382]  I mean, I think I won every debate.
[00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:23.883]  And I saw one channel made like $40 million off you being on there.
[00:26:24.143 --> 00:26:25.443]  They should give all of it to the vets.
[00:26:25.743 --> 00:26:27.924]  I would love to see money go to the Wounded Warriors.
[00:26:27.984 --> 00:26:29.244]  I think it would be so great.
[00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:29.444]  I agree.
[00:26:29.704 --> 00:26:31.205]  What about Crippled America?
[00:26:31.505 --> 00:26:32.345]  It's a number one.
[00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:33.406]  You got a big rally tonight.
[00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:35.226]  Everywhere you go, your crowds just get bigger.
[00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:38.567]  I mean, obviously, you're probably going to get the Republican nomination now.
[00:26:39.047 --> 00:26:40.648]  Wow, and you're ready for the dirty tricks.
[00:26:41.888 --> 00:26:42.929]  One minute left, Donald Trump.
[00:26:42.949 --> 00:26:45.269]  What do you have to say about your book and what's coming up?
[00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:46.690]  I am in this to win it.
[00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.651]  I am not in this to say, oh, gee, I've done a really good job.
[00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:52.612]  A reporter called up, a very powerful reporter, said, how does it feel?
[00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:53.112]  How does it feel?
[00:26:53.132 --> 00:26:56.953]  I said, it only feels, because they said what we've done has never been done before politically.
[00:26:57.313 --> 00:26:58.713]  And I've been in the polls for five months.
[00:26:58.753 --> 00:27:00.134]  Since it came out, I'm number one.
[00:27:00.754 --> 00:27:02.375]  I said, it's only good if we win.
[00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:05.155]  If I don't win, I've wasted a lot of time.
[00:27:05.195 --> 00:27:05.896]  That's the way I view it.
[00:27:05.956 --> 00:27:07.056]  He said, no, no, you haven't.
[00:27:07.076 --> 00:27:07.436]  You haven't.
[00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:09.117]  I said, believe me, if I don't win.
[00:27:09.557 --> 00:27:12.338]  Because we can't do anything to make our country great if I don't win.
[00:27:12.378 --> 00:27:14.318]  I'll be watching television someplace.
[00:27:14.378 --> 00:27:15.119]  It'll be, forget it.
[00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.999]  So I wrote a book called Crippled America.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.520]  It's doing fantastic business.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.201]  I don't know if you can see that thing right up there.
[00:27:22.221 --> 00:27:22.421]  We can.
[00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.422]  But it's doing great business.
[00:27:24.462 --> 00:27:27.804]  I hope your audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else.
[00:27:27.864 --> 00:27:30.887]  And I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing.
[00:27:31.347 --> 00:27:32.668]  I will not let you down.
[00:27:32.688 --> 00:27:35.750]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.232]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be
[00:27:38.832 --> 00:27:41.073]  You'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[00:27:41.113 --> 00:27:43.773]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[00:27:43.833 --> 00:27:48.195]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[00:27:48.255 --> 00:27:50.255]  He said he was going to do it and he did a great job.
[00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:51.656]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:52.416]  Well, I'm impressed.
[00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:53.696]  I mean, you're saying you're fully committed.
[00:27:53.716 --> 00:27:55.797]  You know, there's no future if we don't take this country back.
[00:27:56.157 --> 00:27:58.738]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:01.218]  Thank you so much, sir, that you will be attacked for coming on.
[00:28:01.238 --> 00:28:01.918]  And we know you know that.
[00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:02.299]  Thank you.
[00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:03.619]  Thank you very much.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:12.742 --> 00:28:15.604]  I am Chase Geyser joined by Maria Z here in studio.
[00:28:15.624 --> 00:28:19.348]  We are going to be covering the DNC until there's nothing left to cover.
[00:28:19.888 --> 00:28:23.131]  Yes, that is this evening and that is tomorrow evening as well.
[00:28:23.471 --> 00:28:31.138]  Tonight slated to speak are the likes of Nancy Pelosi, Tim Walz, the Maoist from dozens of visits to China, and of course, Bill Clinton.
[00:28:31.158 --> 00:28:32.419]  We're all very familiar with Bill Clinton.
[00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:34.421]  He's a famous international traveler.
[00:28:35.816 --> 00:28:37.477]  Lolita Express enthusiast.
[00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:41.400]  And Maria Z found this amazing clip.
[00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:42.501]  This is clip number seven.
[00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:43.482]  We're going to run here in a second.
[00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:53.089]  Apparently this evening on the floor of the DNC, the leftists tore out a page from Project 2025, which first of all is irrelevant because Trump has disavowed it.
[00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.393]  But second of all, they tore out a page specifically related to the nuclear family.
[00:28:57.753 --> 00:28:58.554]  I want to run this clip.
[00:28:58.594 --> 00:29:01.256]  It's a short clip and then we'll unpack it on the other side and get Maria's feedback.
[00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:11.828]  And let's talk about Project 2025, Donald Trump's roadmap to ban abortion in all 50 states.
[00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.993]  Look, that sounds crazy.
[00:29:16.055 --> 00:29:31.220]  But right here on page 562, it says that Donald Trump could use an obscure law from the 1800s to single-handedly ban abortion in all 50 states, even putting doctors in jail.
[00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:35.282]  Page 486 puts limits on contraception.
[00:29:35.602 --> 00:29:40.344]  Page 450 threatens access to IVF.
[00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:49.669]  On page 455, Project 2025 says that states have to report miscarriages to the Trump administration.
[00:29:49.709 --> 00:29:55.012]  You hear the crowd just talking in the background because this guy is so boring?
[00:29:55.032 --> 00:30:02.035]  Page 451 says the only legitimate family is a married mother and father where only the father works.
[00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.516]  You know what?
[00:30:05.677 --> 00:30:07.979]  I'm going to take that one out
[00:30:09.403 --> 00:30:12.565]  That's actually a Bible, folks.
[00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:17.408]  So he basically mimics what Nancy Pelosi did at the State of the Union, right?
[00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.248]  When she tore it in half.
[00:30:18.469 --> 00:30:21.951]  But Chase, is there even a book for Project 2025?
[00:30:22.011 --> 00:30:23.051]  I don't think they printed it.
[00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:25.093]  They got this thing bound.
[00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:25.913]  Yeah.
[00:30:26.353 --> 00:30:28.975]  It's like a giant coffee table Bible.
[00:30:29.215 --> 00:30:32.256]  And I think that the page was pre ripped because it came out really.
[00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:32.536]  Yeah.
[00:30:32.796 --> 00:30:32.996]  Yeah.
[00:30:33.036 --> 00:30:36.396]  Well, see, it's a thing like Hulk Hogan can can tear a shirt in half.
[00:30:36.956 --> 00:30:37.576]  No problem.
[00:30:37.596 --> 00:30:39.577]  But the leftist can't even tear a page out of a book.
[00:30:39.597 --> 00:30:40.917]  They have to pre-tear it and prep it.
[00:30:41.137 --> 00:30:44.078]  Have you noticed that they flop their hands around a lot when they're speaking?
[00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:46.698]  They don't they don't really point or.
[00:30:46.858 --> 00:30:47.098]  Right.
[00:30:47.498 --> 00:30:48.438]  They just kind of flop around.
[00:30:48.458 --> 00:30:49.259]  It's called limp wristed.
[00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:49.379]  Right.
[00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:50.319]  Right.
[00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:51.879]  It's like a thing.
[00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:52.579]  I don't know.
[00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:54.259]  So did you watch yesterday and the day before?
[00:30:54.459 --> 00:30:54.780]  I did.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.400]  What'd you think?
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.140]  Honestly?
[00:30:58.035 --> 00:30:58.736]  Yeah, honestly, yeah.
[00:30:58.996 --> 00:30:59.797]  No lie, please.
[00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:04.762]  Truthfully, I'm not really sure what the messaging has been.
[00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:06.163]  It's been a mixed bag.
[00:31:06.924 --> 00:31:09.446]  They don't really seem to have clear direction.
[00:31:09.927 --> 00:31:15.813]  It's a bunch of statements that sound fluffy or sound like, we care because we care.
[00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:16.974]  Oh, okay.
[00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:17.554]  Yes.
[00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:19.857]  It's all emotive, no policy, no specifics.
[00:31:20.453 --> 00:31:24.802]  Even if there is policy, it's weaved in with the emotion.
[00:31:25.103 --> 00:31:29.652]  But I have noticed that for a lot of it, they've toned down the leftist madness.
[00:31:30.193 --> 00:31:30.854]  They seem to be
[00:31:31.809 --> 00:31:35.811]  You know, they're trying to appear a little bit more moderate than usual.
[00:31:36.052 --> 00:31:36.332]  Yes.
[00:31:36.552 --> 00:31:44.096]  Well, now that the primary is over, that's kind of a trend, right, in politics, is that once you get into the general election, both sides are kind of squeezed toward the middle to try to get those independent voters.
[00:31:44.677 --> 00:31:44.977]  Yeah.
[00:31:45.377 --> 00:31:50.140]  So I just can't believe this shift in the energy from Monday night to Tuesday night.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.921]  I don't know if you noticed the same thing or not that I did.
[00:31:52.461 --> 00:32:02.033]  But I felt that on night one, there was this sense that I was getting from the audience shots that they were paid to feign enthusiasm, right?
[00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:08.901]  And on night two, I got a sense of relief from them when Barack and Michelle spoke, like, oh, finally, we don't have to fake.
[00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:29.709]  Support or enthusiasm for whoever's on stage because night one was so just like abundantly boring and you look at the crowd They're like yeah It's like you guys really being genuine or you paid to like paid to be there and then on night two People were almost weeping like cult of personality looking up at either Michelle or Barack who have now fused in this like this Unified being basically the same figure now.
[00:32:29.729 --> 00:32:30.809]  Did you get a sense?
[00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:33.050]  Yeah, it's an unholy union for sure
[00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.091]  I agree with you.
[00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:43.155]  I think it would make sense if they were paid to be there because that's what Kamala's campaign has been doing.
[00:32:43.175 --> 00:32:47.557]  They've been paying influencers and there's many people that have come out showing the emails.
[00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:52.739]  I was offered X amount of dollars to do, you know, to show my support online.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.861]  And I think it was, was it Tyler
[00:32:56.982 --> 00:33:03.897]  Help me with his surname, Chase, if you remember it, who went and actually recorded all the people walking out immediately after the initial...
[00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:08.064]  I know exactly the video you're talking about, but I can't remember the name of the show.
[00:33:08.104 --> 00:33:09.204]  That's okay.
[00:33:09.384 --> 00:33:10.004]  That's alright.
[00:33:10.245 --> 00:33:17.228]  Anyway, you saw the people leaving as soon as the sort of opening of Kamala's entrance was done.
[00:33:18.328 --> 00:33:26.012]  Well, hang on, if you're there for her, first of all, I struggle to believe anyone is there for her because no one voted for her, but if you're there for her, wouldn't you stay?
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.660]  To show support?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.061]  Yeah.
[00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:28.841]  Leave straight away?
[00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:38.226]  Well, and that's been a motif from the leftists, too, is that they'll have, like, Beyonce or some celebrity perform to get a crowd there, and then they just pray that the crowd sticks around for the remarks afterward.
[00:33:38.466 --> 00:33:39.627]  Oh, isn't Pink there tonight?
[00:33:40.407 --> 00:33:41.027]  At the DNC?
[00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:41.848]  Is it Pink tonight?
[00:33:41.968 --> 00:33:42.748]  I thought it was Pink.
[00:33:43.128 --> 00:33:45.009]  Man, when was the last time she had a number one hit?
[00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.231]  They have to really reach into the archives for that.
[00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:50.432]  You know, it's like having Elton John come up and do Tiny Dancer.
[00:33:50.492 --> 00:33:51.233]  Wow, that's from the 70s!
[00:33:51.273 --> 00:33:53.434]  When was the last time you wrote a best-selling album?
[00:33:55.336 --> 00:33:57.537]  Well, I just... Oh, it's John Legend.
[00:33:57.557 --> 00:33:58.378]  John Legend.
[00:33:58.838 --> 00:33:58.998]  Oh.
[00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.099]  Oh, right.
[00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:06.062]  Well, I just know Pink told people that they can't, you know, don't ever come to my concerts again if you don't go and get injected.
[00:34:06.203 --> 00:34:06.683]  So, yeah.
[00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:07.984]  Makes sense that she'd be there.
[00:34:08.204 --> 00:34:08.384]  Yeah.
[00:34:08.404 --> 00:34:09.204]  Did you get vaccinated?
[00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:10.045]  Did she?
[00:34:10.225 --> 00:34:10.545]  Did you?
[00:34:10.885 --> 00:34:11.426]  Did I?
[00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:17.009]  I always love asking you that question on this network because everybody...
[00:34:21.764 --> 00:34:24.666]  So, we've got a bunch of people speaking tonight.
[00:34:24.686 --> 00:34:25.927]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:29.930]  They're tearing out sheets from a book that doesn't even exist in real life.
[00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:30.791]  They printed it.
[00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:32.852]  It's 900 pages, I believe, the original document.
[00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:36.335]  It's not even associated with the Trump campaign at all.
[00:34:36.355 --> 00:34:36.995]  He's disavowed it.
[00:34:37.035 --> 00:34:44.520]  I mean, I guess he knows people that were involved in the writing of the document, but that doesn't make him the same person as the person who wrote the document or the campaign that supported it.
[00:34:46.411 --> 00:34:50.314]  Several clips here that I want to get your feedback on.
[00:34:50.595 --> 00:34:51.355]  First of all, let's run this.
[00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:52.176]  This is clip number four.
[00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:52.856]  RFK Jr.
[00:34:53.297 --> 00:34:59.682]  VP Nicole Shanahan has just said that the campaign's Friday announcement will be one of the biggest events in American election history.
[00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:00.603]  Let's watch this clip.
[00:35:00.643 --> 00:35:03.065]  And Maria Z, I want to get your feedback on the other side.
[00:35:04.017 --> 00:35:06.099]  Let me ask one direct question.
[00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:07.060]  Yeah.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.921]  Should we have our ear to the ground?
[00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:10.242]  Is something going to come soon?
[00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:11.963]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:11.983 --> 00:35:18.508]  I think that Friday is going to be one of the biggest events in American election history.
[00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.650]  What time?
[00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.471]  Where should I tune in?
[00:35:22.992 --> 00:35:24.353]  The details will be shared.
[00:35:24.553 --> 00:35:25.414]  Where?
[00:35:25.474 --> 00:35:30.658]  Go to Bobby's X account and Team Kennedy will be releasing a press release as well.
[00:35:30.678 --> 00:35:31.899]  So what do you think of that?
[00:35:32.386 --> 00:35:37.470]  Yeah, so Alex has come out and broken this, the fact that he's had the inside word.
[00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:44.034]  And everybody's reporting it today like it's brand new information and not citing the fact that Alex last night did a report like, I have top level information.
[00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:45.855]  It's standard.
[00:35:47.537 --> 00:35:56.243]  And I actually think it's a real integrity move, Chase, because if you listen to the other clip that came out about Nicole, you know, sort of discussing that this was
[00:35:56.883 --> 00:36:03.968]  That they were considering this and the reasons for considering this and the fact that if they stayed in the race, OK, yes, it would help them establish an independent party.
[00:36:04.088 --> 00:36:08.090]  But by the same token, it would take away vital votes from Trump.
[00:36:08.451 --> 00:36:08.771]  Yes.
[00:36:09.011 --> 00:36:14.675]  And so their reasoning behind this is literally we, you know, Kamala's bad for the country.
[00:36:15.155 --> 00:36:18.857]  And so I see it almost as it's like self-sacrificial, right?
[00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:19.218]  Yes.
[00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:20.298]  What's happening here?
[00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:25.282]  And I believe he's potentially going to be appointed to a very high position.
[00:36:25.822 --> 00:36:27.223]  Yeah, CIA director.
[00:36:28.344 --> 00:36:29.786]  Well, that'd be awesome.
[00:36:29.866 --> 00:36:31.748]  You'd have to order the assassination of himself.
[00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:40.355]  I've never had any suicidal thoughts, but I have decided to become the CIA director, which is a step in the wrong direction for Kennedy.
[00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:41.436]  But, you know, I understand.
[00:36:41.456 --> 00:36:47.862]  Well, I was concerned about him because obviously there have been mixed reports about who he was pulling more votes from.
[00:36:48.603 --> 00:36:51.065]  But the data that I looked at showed that he was getting
[00:36:52.006 --> 00:36:58.109]  He was getting contributions to his campaign more from prior Trump voters than from prior Biden supporters, right?
[00:36:58.829 --> 00:37:03.871]  And my concern was that he was pulling votes away from Trump because obviously RFK Jr.
[00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:07.912]  is notable for his anti-vaccine status, right?
[00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:10.934]  And the Fauci book that he wrote was outstanding.
[00:37:11.274 --> 00:37:16.016]  And there are a lot of people that feel disenfranchised with Trump because of Operation Warp Speed and the fact that he's been
[00:37:16.676 --> 00:37:20.978]  Fairly brazen, although he's backed off a little bit about supporting and believing in the vaccines.
[00:37:20.998 --> 00:37:22.819]  He doesn't want to admit that that was a disaster.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:37.568]  And obviously there are people that, you know, we're going over to RFK, but my concern about him was, this is somebody who has close relatives who have been almost certainly, I can't say certainly responsibly, but as certain as one can be without being certain.
[00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:39.497]  Murdered by the CIA.
[00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:44.862]  Or the CIA was at least involved in the murder or the cover-up in some meaningful way, right?
[00:37:45.682 --> 00:37:50.927]  And he hired as one of his campaign managers a woman who was former CIA and she married his son.
[00:37:51.027 --> 00:37:53.949]  So now the CIA is married into his family and in his campaign.
[00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.671]  I'm thinking to myself, what is wrong?
[00:37:55.891 --> 00:38:00.215]  Is this like a CIA plant to pull votes away from Trump on purpose in order to usher in the leftist?
[00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:04.640]  But then I hear these reports that this has happened, and I'm thinking that maybe I was wrong to criticize him the whole time.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.942]  Obviously, we won't know for sure until Friday when it actually happens.
[00:38:06.963 --> 00:38:09.125]  You know, the deal's not done until the money's in the bank.
[00:38:09.165 --> 00:38:13.871]  But how do you explain some of these concerns about RFK Jr.
[00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.673]  and what's been happening up to this point?
[00:38:16.033 --> 00:38:18.016]  People have a right to be concerned about everyone.
[00:38:19.257 --> 00:38:20.619]  Including Trump, by the way.
[00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:26.426]  I've been a major critic of Trump, although I generally support him.
[00:38:27.407 --> 00:38:32.793]  And the main reason for that is I think that if you care about people, you should speak
[00:38:33.334 --> 00:38:38.297]  Honestly, to those people about your concerns and hope that they change their behavior.
[00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:40.178]  So, you know, the injections were one major thing.
[00:38:40.198 --> 00:38:45.601]  And I know that a lot of people were critical of, you know, begging him actually on Truth Social.
[00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:55.166]  The last time I noticed, Chase, that he was talking about that, I think he sort of said, oh, you know, Biden was taking credit for cancer injections and Trump made a comment.
[00:38:55.186 --> 00:38:57.267]  And then people were saying, sir, please, I'm begging you.
[00:38:57.808 --> 00:38:59.929]  These injections have hurt my family or whatever.
[00:38:59.969 --> 00:39:01.870]  And I noticed that after that, he stopped.
[00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.551]  Definitely an outsider.
[00:39:18.886 --> 00:39:21.669]  He actually answers pretty much every question, Chase.
[00:39:21.689 --> 00:39:25.634]  I haven't seen him dodge and weave in the ways that I see other politicians doing.
[00:39:25.674 --> 00:39:36.407]  Well, KJP, when she's asked about Vice President Kamala Harris' achievements, for example, this clip went viral this week, and she basically goes on for 90 seconds saying that Kamala Harris' biggest achievement is being Kamala Harris.
[00:39:36.827 --> 00:39:36.947]  Yeah.
[00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:42.311]  You know, she goes into her identity and the fact that she was appointed vice president.
[00:39:42.812 --> 00:39:44.773]  The office that you have is not your achievement.
[00:39:44.813 --> 00:39:47.896]  It's not like an award to get this, to win an election.
[00:39:47.996 --> 00:39:51.899]  It's what you do with the power that you get once you're in that office that is your achievement, right?
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.823]  And frankly, one could say that Joe Biden's greatest achievement is becoming the president of the United States.
[00:39:56.843 --> 00:39:59.385]  It's certainly not anything that he's done while he's been president, right?
[00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.622]  I can't think of one good thing?
[00:40:04.084 --> 00:40:04.504]  Just one?
[00:40:04.524 --> 00:40:05.845]  I think there was one.
[00:40:06.126 --> 00:40:06.346]  What?
[00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:07.266]  I'm thinking.
[00:40:08.127 --> 00:40:08.728]  There was one.
[00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:09.108]  Oh!
[00:40:09.128 --> 00:40:11.650]  He had the Julian Assange deal.
[00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:12.731]  That was probably a good one.
[00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:12.991]  Right.
[00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:14.252]  But that wasn't really him.
[00:40:14.272 --> 00:40:15.212]  That was the Justice Department.
[00:40:15.232 --> 00:40:16.573]  But it was his Justice Department.
[00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.495]  And it could have been happening a long time ago.
[00:40:18.535 --> 00:40:20.016]  I mean, Barack Obama could have done it, right?
[00:40:20.036 --> 00:40:20.456]  Right.
[00:40:20.496 --> 00:40:21.517]  When he was VP.
[00:40:21.537 --> 00:40:21.617]  Yeah.
[00:40:21.957 --> 00:40:23.138]  So, that's an easy one, right?
[00:40:23.158 --> 00:40:25.740]  You don't actually have to negotiate with Congress to get that done.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.521]  You just snap your finger.
[00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:27.962]  He's given us a lot of good memes.
[00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:28.915]  Yes.
[00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:30.576]  A lot of good news.
[00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:31.796]  Thank you, Joe.
[00:40:32.356 --> 00:40:35.177]  So how long do you think that he's actually been suffering from dementia?
[00:40:35.277 --> 00:40:37.018]  I've heard rumors it goes back as far as 2019.
[00:40:37.278 --> 00:40:48.621]  Tucker did an interview, and I can't remember now again, the name of the person that he did it with, who was saying that there were concerns right from even as he was running for office the last time.
[00:40:48.661 --> 00:40:49.382]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:49.662 --> 00:40:53.523]  Well, Tucker, I believe, used to be neighbors with, was it Hunter Biden specifically?
[00:40:54.468 --> 00:40:54.809]  I don't know.
[00:41:10.189 --> 00:41:10.630]  We're good to go.
[00:41:29.628 --> 00:41:35.873]  That they explicitly told her personally that there were concerns about Joe Biden running for president because he had been diagnosed with dementia.
[00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:41.377]  But they thought that he wasn't going to win and this run was like kind of his last, you know, like hurrah.
[00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:42.798]  And then he ended up winning.
[00:41:43.118 --> 00:41:43.298]  Wow.
[00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:46.261]  And it was like, oh, how are we going to keep this guy operating?
[00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:49.823]  I mean, we're like one lithium ion battery away from Kamala Harris being president.
[00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:51.164]  They were neighbors.
[00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:52.585]  Oh, we got a fact check.
[00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:53.146]  I told you.
[00:41:54.167 --> 00:41:54.427]  Yeah.
[00:41:54.587 --> 00:41:56.328]  So anyway, what do you think is going to happen on November 5th?
[00:41:56.348 --> 00:41:57.249]  Do you think it's too big to rig?
[00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:03.332]  I think the RFK move is going to shake things up significantly.
[00:42:03.352 --> 00:42:17.862]  I've seen a lot of people on X Today who are RFK supporters saying, I prefer RFK over all of them, but if I'm, you know, forced to choose between Trump and Kamala, I'm going Trump, even though, you know, he's not my favorite.
[00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:20.984]  And so I think that that's going to
[00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:25.185]  This is going to really shake things up, Chase.
[00:42:25.265 --> 00:42:34.395]  I don't know that the media is going to be able to keep up the facade of Kamala being everyone's favorite for much longer.
[00:42:34.415 --> 00:42:36.437]  I mean, even CNN was criticizing her today.
[00:42:36.937 --> 00:42:37.157]  Yes.
[00:42:37.538 --> 00:42:43.304]  And they've criticized her repeatedly, specifically her price-fixing push for groceries, price caps on groceries.
[00:42:43.615 --> 00:42:44.756]  Yes, because she wants to turn the U.S.
[00:42:44.776 --> 00:42:45.576]  into Venezuela.
[00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:46.136]  Yes.
[00:42:46.317 --> 00:42:57.323]  And for two and a half minutes, they had an expert on that was like, it's not even legal for her to do this because in order to enforce it, you have to open up certain doors that make like collusion possible.
[00:42:57.403 --> 00:43:03.046]  And it's just like the way, the way that it would have to be implemented is just totally, first of all, it's unconstitutional, but it's just impossible to do.
[00:43:03.066 --> 00:43:03.606]  Yeah.
[00:43:03.666 --> 00:43:10.030]  And they're saying that on CNN, CNN the other day with, um, um, oh, I can't remember the name of the host was saying that,
[00:43:12.749 --> 00:43:18.492]  They were scared at how close this race was, despite the unilateral coverage that was negative about Donald Trump.
[00:43:18.933 --> 00:43:26.737]  And so, yeah, when you see them turn on themselves, this is almost looking kind of like what was happening in the media in the weeks leading up to Joe Biden being ousted in this coup.
[00:43:26.777 --> 00:43:29.778]  Like, you just saw kind of a weird betrayal happening in a subtle way.
[00:43:29.798 --> 00:43:34.621]  You know, kind of like when you're in a relationship with someone and, like, you just notice the last few months things have been distant.
[00:43:34.721 --> 00:43:37.463]  Like, that was kind of how the media treated Joe Biden, right?
[00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:37.743]  Yeah.
[00:43:37.803 --> 00:43:38.723]  And then all of a sudden, boom!
[00:43:38.763 --> 00:43:39.163]  Breakup!
[00:43:39.203 --> 00:43:39.824]  Cheating on you!
[00:43:39.864 --> 00:43:40.484]  You know, right?
[00:43:42.145 --> 00:43:42.906]  That was what I saw.
[00:43:42.946 --> 00:43:47.789]  So it's funny you mentioned that though because we have Don Lemon that's been posting these videos.
[00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:49.510]  I'm going to run clip number six here in a second.
[00:43:50.010 --> 00:44:00.897]  Don Lemon has been posting these videos all week and I am so amazed that he's been posting this because it's totally antithetical to his political persuasion to highlight how many people are actually supporting Trump over Kamala.
[00:44:00.917 --> 00:44:02.718]  I want to see what you think of this, Maurizio.
[00:44:02.738 --> 00:44:03.719]  Let's run clip number six, please.
[00:44:05.302 --> 00:44:06.222]  How are you feeling about the election?
[00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:07.663]  I'm going for Trump.
[00:44:07.903 --> 00:44:16.587]  I feel like every time they don't want somebody who is good for us to win, they throw somebody black in our face thinking that's gonna, like, make us vote for the black person.
[00:44:16.627 --> 00:44:18.208]  I voted for Obama because he was black.
[00:44:18.268 --> 00:44:21.929]  I don't want to vote for her because she's the first black woman to run for president or to win.
[00:44:22.149 --> 00:44:22.650]  I don't vote.
[00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.551]  Well, I want Donald Trump.
[00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:26.051]  I'm sorry, I want Donald Trump.
[00:44:26.071 --> 00:44:26.832]  Why do you apologize?
[00:44:27.192 --> 00:44:30.593]  Well, I know nobody likes him, but we had good times with Donald Trump.
[00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:32.574]  I'm running for Trump, so... You are?
[00:44:32.654 --> 00:44:32.834]  Yeah.
[00:44:33.274 --> 00:44:33.554]  Yeah.
[00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:34.235]  Well, why?
[00:44:34.335 --> 00:44:34.495]  Yeah.
[00:44:35.074 --> 00:44:35.334]  I don't know.
[00:44:35.394 --> 00:44:38.155]  I've just always been a fan of his, so that's what I'm in for.
[00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.135]  I used to be against Trump.
[00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:40.095]  I used to live in Virginia.
[00:44:40.175 --> 00:44:43.976]  I saw the bad side of it, but really moving to Cleveland, but I saw the other side of it.
[00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:45.057]  I'm supporting Trump.
[00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:46.197]  You are?
[00:44:46.237 --> 00:44:46.457]  Mm-hmm.
[00:44:46.557 --> 00:44:46.897]  Because?
[00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:48.298]  Because it has to change.
[00:44:48.918 --> 00:44:49.338]  Yeah.
[00:44:49.358 --> 00:44:58.680]  It has to change, and now I vote more for what fits me better as a person rather than voting for the black person or voting for the first woman, so.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.781]  What do you think about Kamala Harris?
[00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:02.361]  I'd like to say she phony and fake, you know what I'm saying?
[00:45:02.381 --> 00:45:03.842]  So, like, you know, I'm like Trump saying, you know,
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.041]  What are you, you know?
[00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:07.162]  So I just, I'm not feeling her.
[00:45:07.342 --> 00:45:09.063]  People get mad about it, I'm just not feeling her.
[00:45:09.103 --> 00:45:13.126]  I don't like her, the way she speaks, the giddiness, the laughing.
[00:45:13.566 --> 00:45:16.048]  Everything's a joke and it's not a joke, we're in trouble.
[00:45:16.188 --> 00:45:16.929]  I'm going for Trump.
[00:45:17.669 --> 00:45:20.691]  Kamala was on Biden's team and I don't like Biden.
[00:45:21.112 --> 00:45:23.173]  Gas wasn't this high when Trump was our president.
[00:45:23.193 --> 00:45:24.234]  Food wasn't this high.
[00:45:24.754 --> 00:45:25.455]  I'm going for Trump.
[00:45:26.255 --> 00:45:32.100]  And look, the fact of the matter is, you don't have to watch a Don Lemon clip going around asking people,
[00:45:33.254 --> 00:45:33.494]  We're good.
[00:45:56.155 --> 00:45:58.097]  Leftists protesting outside the DNC.
[00:45:58.117 --> 00:45:59.538]  It's not like right-wing extremists are.
[00:45:59.838 --> 00:46:06.163]  We've got Kristan Harris and Alex Stringer Skyping in from the ground.
[00:46:06.904 --> 00:46:09.185]  We're going to go to Kristan Harris first.
[00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:11.307]  Kristan, it's always an honor and a pleasure to be with you, man.
[00:46:11.347 --> 00:46:13.689]  You do such great work when you guest host here on this network.
[00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:16.932]  What is happening on the ground outside the DNC?
[00:46:17.052 --> 00:46:18.893]  Are these protests getting crazy?
[00:46:18.913 --> 00:46:19.273]  What's up?
[00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:19.774]  Just fill us in.
[00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:27.662]  Yeah, Chase, last night there was a protest and over 70 people were arrested, including four media personnel.
[00:46:28.063 --> 00:46:29.845]  It's been a wild time here.
[00:46:29.905 --> 00:46:34.590]  There's over, I would say, well over a thousand Democrats here protesting.
[00:46:36.297 --> 00:46:36.677]  We're good.
[00:46:55.457 --> 00:47:01.864]  Uh, you know, with what's going on between Hamas, Palestine and Israel, and they're really upset.
[00:47:01.884 --> 00:47:04.086]  No one's speaking very highly of Kamala Harris.
[00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:10.873]  There's a lot of signs calling them genocide Joe and saying that she's going to carry on the very same policies that Joe Biden will.
[00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:15.938]  A lot of the third party talk, a lot of new party talk, and now we're talking thousands.
[00:47:16.578 --> 00:47:17.939]  People over the last few days.
[00:47:17.959 --> 00:47:21.540]  There's a big protest tomorrow looking forward to covering as well.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.440]  But it is getting wild last night.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.541]  There was a was that make it great like 68.
[00:47:27.542 --> 00:47:30.683]  And then in 1968, there was a riot here, I believe.
[00:47:30.803 --> 00:47:37.085]  And so it's pretty interesting because last night and it looked like the anti-fascist led a protest.
[00:47:37.105 --> 00:47:43.327]  They got a little out of hand, got a little crazy, and they ended up arresting 70 individuals last night.
[00:47:43.587 --> 00:47:46.209]  Did you say four media personnel were arrested?
[00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:56.275]  Yeah, which is the scary thing because we're supposed to have freedom of the press, but yes, four media personnel were arrested last night.
[00:47:57.696 --> 00:48:08.583]  One of them had a New York press pass, the other three, I'm not quite sure of what their position was in media yet, but we are getting more details throughout the day as they're being released.
[00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:14.498]  We're just getting word that there are reports that they may have been Antifa affiliated.
[00:48:14.578 --> 00:48:16.320]  So maybe that explains it.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.041]  But I agree with you.
[00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.803]  We're supposed to have freedom of the press.
[00:48:19.304 --> 00:48:25.411]  So if they weren't agitating, you know, it's it's I mean, I'd certainly love to know more about that.
[00:48:26.027 --> 00:48:27.008]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:27.128 --> 00:48:29.250]  Alex Stringer, what is happening with you on the ground there?
[00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.950]  What have you noticed?
[00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:34.554]  I'm curious to know if it seems like many of these protesters are locals or if they've been bused in.
[00:48:34.674 --> 00:48:39.818]  Obviously, a lot of these Free Palestine protests have been associated with college campuses.
[00:48:39.858 --> 00:48:43.180]  We've certainly seen that here in Austin, Texas with professors and students alike.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.321]  What have you noticed on the ground there?
[00:48:45.442 --> 00:48:54.049]  Well, what I've noticed is that you have 99% progressive-minded people and there is absolutely no love
[00:48:54.437 --> 00:48:56.338]  For Kamala Harris in any capacity.
[00:48:56.599 --> 00:49:01.282]  I mean, I'm literally, I'm pretty much next to a lady.
[00:49:01.822 --> 00:49:03.183]  Hey, ma'am.
[00:49:05.304 --> 00:49:12.990]  Look, we literally have, there's a whole trove of Abandoned Harris signs.
[00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:14.911]  I have like
[00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:23.824]  I have tons of video footage yet to upload where you just have multiple people at these protests openly condemning Kamala Harris.
[00:49:23.944 --> 00:49:30.387]  I have a whole pictographic album of signs of these people condemning Harris, saying that they're not going to vote for Harris.
[00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:40.691]  Numerous people have said that they will not vote for Kamala even if it does mean Trump getting back in office.
[00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:41.771]  And then on the other hand,
[00:49:42.219 --> 00:49:48.362]  You know, you do have, I went to Milwaukee, I went to the Harris rally in Milwaukee and you know, there are some truths, right?
[00:49:48.402 --> 00:50:07.350]  And it's the fact that like, yes, Kamala Harris is packing stadiums, but I did, um, I had one clip that got a lot of attention that's getting a lot of attention today, but I have some other video footage that I haven't released yet where there's a ton of these people who I spoke to that said that they would have, they would have voted for a corpse instead of Donald Trump.
[00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:08.110]  And so,
[00:50:08.991 --> 00:50:12.092]  You know, just because Kamala's packing stadiums doesn't mean that she's getting new voters.
[00:50:12.372 --> 00:50:15.592]  It just means that the people that are going to vote for her are just more excited to do so.
[00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:21.994]  And we got to deconstruct that narrative because there is no love or no organic grassroots support for Kamala in any capacity.
[00:50:22.294 --> 00:50:22.514]  Wow.
[00:50:22.674 --> 00:50:28.775]  And you said that these people are saying that even they're saying even if Trump, it means that Trump gets in, they are not voting for Kamala.
[00:50:30.296 --> 00:50:30.556]  Yeah.
[00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:31.176]  Yeah.
[00:50:31.316 --> 00:50:33.636]  I have had numerous people say that to me.
[00:50:34.017 --> 00:50:35.757]  I recorded a conversation that some, um,
[00:50:36.932 --> 00:50:37.853]  Yeah, we're going to abstain.
[00:51:03.915 --> 00:51:11.781]  These people, if only half of them decide that they're not voting for Harris, there's no mathematical path for this person to win.
[00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:16.565]  And they're literally staging these demonstrations like, hey, we're going to disrupt the DNC like 1968.
[00:51:16.945 --> 00:51:18.106]  What happened in 1968?
[00:51:18.627 --> 00:51:21.709]  The Democratic Party got annihilated electorally.
[00:51:22.229 --> 00:51:25.372]  So you're noticing history repeating itself.
[00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:38.760]  And, you know, you have corporate media trying to gaslight you, but all you have to do is have basic conversations with regular people to know that there is no mathematical chance for this administration to get re-elected.
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.902]  Like, there's no approval on any side for these people.
[00:51:41.422 --> 00:51:41.742]  Wow.
[00:51:41.943 --> 00:51:48.387]  Kristan Harris, have you seen anybody in these audiences show any pro-Trump support either?
[00:51:48.407 --> 00:51:50.708]  I mean, do you think you'd be well-received in a MAGA hat there?
[00:51:51.009 --> 00:51:54.251]  Or is this simply about hating the current administration and supporting Palestine?
[00:51:56.022 --> 00:52:10.609]  There's a lot of people that believe that they may revert back to Donald Trump if it comes to that, if they don't get their demands met with disarming Israel, no longer sending money to Israel, amongst other things.
[00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:13.491]  And it seems like a lot of the Palestinians
[00:52:13.991 --> 00:52:17.857]  Here are not very big Kamala Harris fans as well.
[00:52:17.897 --> 00:52:22.304]  Keep in mind a lot of these minority communities are very traditional.
[00:52:23.005 --> 00:52:24.447]  You know, the men lead the household.
[00:52:24.768 --> 00:52:26.150]  Same thing with Latino communities.
[00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:29.595]  The question is, will they come out and vote for a female for president?
[00:52:30.095 --> 00:52:32.377]  And that's because they're very traditional families.
[00:52:33.638 --> 00:52:39.122]  They're going to have to really reach out and try to cross over and get them to buy into Kamala Harris.
[00:52:39.482 --> 00:52:40.623]  And I don't think they're going to do that.
[00:52:40.723 --> 00:52:47.608]  In Milwaukee, when I was there briefly, when I was there with Alex for a short time, I gave him a ride out there.
[00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:50.310]  And it was almost all Caucasians.
[00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:56.034]  There's almost no minority support at Pfizer for Milwaukee, which I found very interesting.
[00:52:56.594 --> 00:53:05.681]  Uh, which is unusual considering that you'd think that there would be a large minority, um, outpouring for Kamala Harris, uh, given the fact that she could break that glass ceiling.
[00:53:05.881 --> 00:53:06.001]  Yeah.
[00:53:06.021 --> 00:53:10.004]  To be the first female, uh, president and minority president there at Convo.
[00:53:10.724 --> 00:53:13.686]  Well, um, Kristoff, Kriston, I want to ask you something.
[00:53:13.846 --> 00:53:18.249]  You, um, you said that a lot of these people are saying that they would even prefer to vote for Trump.
[00:53:18.329 --> 00:53:21.532]  Is this because of the fact that he has promised to end all the wars?
[00:53:21.612 --> 00:53:24.734]  Is, is this the main reason why these people are saying this?
[00:53:26.474 --> 00:53:29.757]  No, I think it's because they feel like they're not getting listened to and it's a default.
[00:53:29.777 --> 00:53:35.342]  A lot of them have said that they wouldn't, they don't really want to, but they will if they don't get their demands met.
[00:53:35.782 --> 00:53:36.182]  Interesting.
[00:53:36.663 --> 00:53:40.186]  Well, Kriston, can you please share with the audience where people can find you and follow you?
[00:53:40.206 --> 00:53:43.148]  And then we'll go back to Stringer for a couple of questions and have him do the same.
[00:53:43.709 --> 00:53:43.929]  Yeah.
[00:53:44.796 --> 00:53:45.636]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:47.017]  You can find me on X.com.
[00:53:47.077 --> 00:53:48.338]  Tristan T. Harris.
[00:53:49.018 --> 00:53:50.439]  There's a video that's gone viral.
[00:53:50.459 --> 00:53:51.579]  8 million views.
[00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:53.320]  You guys can check it out.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.121]  You can find me there.
[00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:58.743]  Rumble.com forward slash TheRundownLive and TheRundownLive.com.
[00:53:58.763 --> 00:54:00.244]  Thanks for having me on, Chase Geyser.
[00:54:00.284 --> 00:54:06.487]  It's always a blessing to join you guys at these events and bring you a man on the streets perspective.
[00:54:06.507 --> 00:54:07.067]  Thank you, guys.
[00:54:07.407 --> 00:54:07.988]  Awesome work.
[00:54:08.188 --> 00:54:08.888]  Mad respect.
[00:54:08.988 --> 00:54:13.512]  Alex Stringer, do you think this is going to ramp up as things get later into the evening?
[00:54:13.632 --> 00:54:16.514]  Is this seem to be heating up over the last several days?
[00:54:17.015 --> 00:54:18.696]  Do you think tomorrow night's going to be the finale?
[00:54:18.936 --> 00:54:21.578]  How are things looking for the next several hours?
[00:54:23.115 --> 00:54:23.436]  I think so.
[00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:39.497]  We're good to go.
[00:54:58.217 --> 00:55:03.818]  White boomers who, you know, 30, 40 years ago, you would think they were all watching Fox News together.
[00:55:03.838 --> 00:55:11.940]  And then when you go out in the streets and talk to, like, minorities in the community, a lot of them, they're either A, voting Trump, or B, refusing to vote for Harris.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.161]  So there's, like, a huge disconnect.
[00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:17.982]  And it's very much, like, a class level that the media is just blatantly ignoring.
[00:55:18.022 --> 00:55:24.524]  But like I said earlier, dude, there's no support for this administration in any capacity whatsoever, man.
[00:55:24.584 --> 00:55:25.144]  It's obvious.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:33.684]  You know, you have you have thousands of people literally chanting, you know, calling Biden genocide, Joe and Kamala, killer Kamala.
[00:55:34.404 --> 00:55:37.366]  And there are all these infographics depicting like
[00:55:38.355 --> 00:55:40.177]  Just depicting these people in the worst way.
[00:55:40.797 --> 00:55:44.560]  The level of enthusiasm for these people is at an all-time low.
[00:55:45.621 --> 00:55:51.845]  You have a party that's created a foundation based on wokeism and identity politics with nothing tangible to stand on.
[00:55:52.806 --> 00:55:54.447]  This is the culmination of that.
[00:55:54.487 --> 00:55:55.828]  You get people just eating themselves.
[00:55:56.068 --> 00:55:57.910]  This is what you're seeing right now in front of you.
[00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:06.196]  It's just an amazing stark difference between what they're pretending is happening on the inside and what's really happening on the outside.
[00:56:07.552 --> 00:56:13.697]  It's amazing to see those two shots that we just had someone dancing, pretending this is all great and everyone wants Kamala.
[00:56:14.058 --> 00:56:16.880]  And then we have all of these people who would normally... It's literally a bubble.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:21.364]  Like they're literally in a big bubble and the rest of the world's screaming in and they're pretending nothing's happening.
[00:56:21.564 --> 00:56:22.004]  Amazing.
[00:56:22.284 --> 00:56:22.505]  Wow.
[00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:25.987]  Alex Stringer, any final thoughts and where can people find you and follow you?
[00:56:26.027 --> 00:56:30.651]  We're obviously very appreciative that you've chimed in and Kriston Harris have chimed in as well.
[00:56:31.332 --> 00:56:31.852]  Great work.
[00:56:31.912 --> 00:56:32.593]  Proud of you guys.
[00:56:32.613 --> 00:56:33.413]  Awesome stuff.
[00:56:33.614 --> 00:56:35.155]  Final thoughts and where can people follow you?
[00:56:35.415 --> 00:56:35.715]  Thank you.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.921]  Follow my ex at The Alex Stranger.

[00:56:47.183 --> 00:56:48.604]  Rumble Alex Stranger.
[00:56:48.624 --> 00:56:51.685]  All you gotta do is literally type my name into Google search and you can find me.
[00:56:51.705 --> 00:56:54.006]  You can find all my videos and keep up with everything I'm doing.
[00:56:55.226 --> 00:56:57.087]  The best way to fight tyranny is through comedy.
[00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:02.669]  And the best way to combat this Orwellian future that they're trying to usher us into is to just tell the truth.
[00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:03.489]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:57:04.175 --> 00:57:04.856]  Well, awesome.
[00:57:04.996 --> 00:57:05.616]  Great work, man.
[00:57:05.656 --> 00:57:05.857]  Thank you.
[00:57:05.917 --> 00:57:10.881]  And actually, you know, I ran, I showed one of Alex's videos, Alex Stringer's videos on the War Room today.
[00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:12.483]  It'd be awesome if the crew could pull that in.
[00:57:12.523 --> 00:57:16.046]  Just to give our audience here tonight a sense of the work that he's done.
[00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:17.027]  Have you ever seen any of his work?
[00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:17.548]  No, I haven't.
[00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:18.969]  Oh, it was absolutely hysterical.
[00:57:18.989 --> 00:57:27.997]  He did this satirical bit where he was inside the DNC, I believe, and he was pretending to be an enthusiastic leftist, and the things that he was saying as he was being interviewed were just absolutely hysterical.
[00:57:28.018 --> 00:57:29.419]  If you've got the clip, guys, that'd be great.
[00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.681]  What do you think of what's going on outside the DNC?
[00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:39.868]  I mean, it's easy to overlook because everybody wants to, you know, report on the people speaking inside and how they're evil satanists and things like that, but the outside is just as big of a story, isn't it?
[00:57:40.268 --> 00:57:41.669]  Probably a bigger story, Trace.
[00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:44.812]  And you know, what Alex just said was absolutely correct.
[00:57:44.832 --> 00:57:47.954]  This is the culmination of a movement that has no foundation.
[00:57:47.974 --> 00:57:52.578]  They're literally eating themselves and this is what always happens with leftism because there is no foundation.
[00:57:52.618 --> 00:57:54.620]  Just like at the start of the show when we
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:03.250]  Speaking about the last couple of days has literally just been emotional statements and we're going to do this because we feel good when we do this.
[00:58:04.131 --> 00:58:05.512]  That is not what builds a country.
[00:58:05.532 --> 00:58:06.754]  Wow.
[00:58:06.854 --> 00:58:07.735]  Well, you know what we should do?
[00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:09.837]  We should cut straight to this right now because who is that?
[00:58:11.459 --> 00:58:12.400]  That's Keenan.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.321]  Keenan's speaking right now.
[00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:14.663]  Let's cut to it and hear what he's got to say.
[00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:25.955]  You know how when you download an app and there are hundreds of pages there that you don't read, it's just the terms and conditions, and you just click agree, right?
[00:58:27.335 --> 00:58:31.177]  Well, these are the terms and conditions of a second Trump presidency.
[00:58:31.917 --> 00:58:34.358]  You vote for him, you vote for all of this.
[00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:35.318]  Let's take a look.
[00:58:38.779 --> 00:58:40.960]  All right, we got Matt here with us tonight.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.680]  Is Matt here?
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.460]  Hey, there he is.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.821]  Matt, how are you, sir?
[00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:47.151]  All right, Matt.
[00:58:48.312 --> 00:58:55.193]  Now, Matt, I understand that you work as an AV tech in Nevada, and you make a decent hourly wage, is that right?
[00:58:59.835 --> 00:59:01.055]  Oh, I don't know if we can hear Matt.
[00:59:01.075 --> 00:59:01.855]  Can we hear Matt?
[00:59:03.896 --> 00:59:04.796]  So who's gonna fix it?
[00:59:07.537 --> 00:59:09.017]  Keep speaking, Matt, so we can hear you.
[00:59:09.037 --> 00:59:10.197]  What's wrong with Matt's face?
[00:59:11.658 --> 00:59:13.018]  Okay, that's good.
[00:59:13.038 --> 00:59:13.998]  Matt wasn't that good.
[00:59:14.099 --> 00:59:15.659]  I guess we're gonna move on from Matt.
[00:59:19.076 --> 00:59:19.676]  Oh, man.
[00:59:19.836 --> 00:59:20.837]  And this is Becky.
[00:59:20.997 --> 00:59:22.037]  Becky, can we hear you?
[00:59:23.218 --> 00:59:24.979]  I came in, and it's great to be here.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.640]  Thank you.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:28.920]  All right, good.
[00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:33.102]  Now, Becky, you're married, correct?
[00:59:33.883 --> 00:59:34.363]  I am.
[00:59:34.403 --> 00:59:36.644]  Me and my wife have been together for about eight years.
[00:59:37.244 --> 00:59:37.504]  Oh!
[00:59:40.666 --> 00:59:41.686]  That's amazing.
[00:59:41.926 --> 00:59:42.967]  Very, very cute.
[00:59:43.547 --> 00:59:43.847]  Thanks.
[00:59:44.827 --> 00:59:47.168]  But I have got some bad news for you.
[00:59:49.076 --> 00:59:52.339]  Is that the Nashville mayor they just shot to in the front?
[00:59:52.399 --> 00:59:52.839]  I didn't say.
[00:59:52.859 --> 00:59:56.382]  With the glasses on he looks like Aldous Huxley if he sold a soul.
[00:59:56.642 --> 00:59:58.143]  What is she doing?
[00:59:58.183 --> 01:00:00.745]  Why does she keep touching her chest?
[01:00:04.228 --> 01:00:08.151]  This is not how you behave about election issues.
[01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:10.153]  Well Tim Walz is doing a heart clutch too.
[01:00:17.133 --> 01:00:18.194]  We have Nirvana.
[01:00:18.234 --> 01:00:19.455]  Nirvana, are you with us?
[01:00:21.277 --> 01:00:22.778]  And your people are with us as well?
[01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:23.939]  All right, good.
[01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:32.467]  Now, Nirvana, I understand that you are on insulin to manage your diabetes, yes?
[01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:39.414]  Yes, and thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris, I only pay $35 a month for my insulin.
[01:00:46.223 --> 01:00:46.943]  That is great.
[01:00:48.304 --> 01:00:49.045]  That is great.
[01:00:49.925 --> 01:00:50.265]  But!
[01:00:52.627 --> 01:01:05.574]  On page 465, Project 2025 calls for millions of people like yourself to pay more for prescription drugs like insulin.
[01:01:06.755 --> 01:01:07.155]  Why?
[01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:07.235]  Why?
[01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:13.719]  Well, I guess maybe to help Big Pharma make more money that they can donate to Republican politicians, I assume.
[01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:17.831]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.432]  Yes, unfortunately, it does make sense.
[01:01:21.772 --> 01:01:23.213]  All right, let's talk to Anita.
[01:01:23.293 --> 01:01:24.213]  Anita, are you there?
[01:01:26.294 --> 01:01:26.674]  Yes.
[01:01:27.654 --> 01:01:28.414]  Hello, Anita.
[01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.135]  Hello.
[01:01:30.795 --> 01:01:32.195]  And Anita, what do you do for a living?
[01:01:33.115 --> 01:01:34.396]  I'm an OGYN.
[01:01:34.636 --> 01:01:37.577]  I'm unemployed, looking for a job, struggling.
[01:01:37.617 --> 01:01:38.997]  My husband's paycheck to paycheck.
[01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:45.573]  You know, they keep going on about prescription medicine, Chase.
[01:01:45.593 --> 01:01:47.573]  I know, but none of them know how to get Ozepic.
[01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:54.515]  I wanted to say, no one's asking why do so many people have diabetes?
[01:01:54.555 --> 01:01:56.755]  Because they don't use Ozepic.
[01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:01.697]  We should make them a sponsor.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.681]  Yes, it is awful.
[01:02:11.821 --> 01:02:12.161]  All right.
[01:02:12.281 --> 01:02:20.025]  I just I love that picture and picture that you guys have been showing of the terrorists outside.
[01:02:21.246 --> 01:02:21.966]  Let's talk to you.
[01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:25.148]  I understand that you work for the federal government.
[01:02:26.288 --> 01:02:26.909]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:29.470]  I'm in the United States Department of Education.
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:30.290]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:36.078 --> 01:02:39.920]  She works for the Department of Education and she's a proud civil servant.
[01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:56.388]  Well, unfortunately for you, on page 78, Project 2025 calls for President Trump to purge the civil service of everyone who isn't a MAGA loyalist.
[01:02:56.668 --> 01:02:58.109]  Are you a MAGA loyalist?
[01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.250]  No, Keena.
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:02.111]  Absolutely not.
[01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:14.633]  I mean, you might as well be, because also, page 319 calls for the complete elimination of the Department of Education.
[01:03:14.673 --> 01:03:14.993]  Yes.
[01:03:15.193 --> 01:03:18.115]  Like, oh, are you a Kamala loyalist?
[01:03:18.135 --> 01:03:20.636]  Like, if I asked somebody a question like that, I would feel comfortable asking that question.
[01:03:20.656 --> 01:03:20.996]  Yes.
[01:03:21.196 --> 01:03:21.397]  Right?
[01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:21.517]  Yes.
[01:03:21.557 --> 01:03:23.438]  That's all we have time for at the moment.
[01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:27.840]  Just remember, everything that we just talked about is very real.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.301]  It is in this book.
[01:03:30.131 --> 01:03:33.372]  They had it printed.
[01:03:33.492 --> 01:03:36.794]  They're the ones that actually printed the book.
[01:03:37.154 --> 01:03:39.635]  They did, and they had it bound.
[01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:46.438]  Not very environmentally friendly to print that big.
[01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:48.819]  That is CO2 emissions right there.
[01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.160]  Yeah, like three trees died.
[01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.287]  Like the one from Ferngully.
[01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:52.967]  Died.
[01:03:53.108 --> 01:03:54.449]  You ever see that movie?
[01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:55.429]  Ferngully?
[01:03:55.449 --> 01:03:56.290]  I'm not sure that I have.
[01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.352]  It's like an environmental cartoon from the 90s.
[01:03:58.492 --> 01:03:58.812]  Right.
[01:03:58.892 --> 01:03:59.152]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.673 --> 01:04:05.738]  And the whole story is a fairy and this guy and he becomes fairy sized while he was like drilling this tree that the fairy lived in.
[01:04:06.058 --> 01:04:10.622]  He falls in love with the fairy and it comes out that he was responsible for the death of the forest and there's a magic tree.
[01:04:10.882 --> 01:04:13.985]  The whole thing is a metaphor for climate change and saving the rainforest.
[01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:14.265]  Right.
[01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:17.828]  They're actually making a live action version of it now because it's nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the 90s.
[01:04:18.608 --> 01:04:23.194]  But anyway, that was the joke that the tree from Ferngully must have had to die in order to make that book.
[01:04:23.415 --> 01:04:24.436]  All the 90s kids will get it.
[01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:29.663]  It's really funny that they're remaking it because obviously they want to revamp that message.
[01:04:29.943 --> 01:04:32.607]  But isn't Bill Gates saying we need to cut down all of the trees?
[01:04:32.787 --> 01:04:34.749]  Well, he says that he doesn't plant trees.
[01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:37.332]  I don't plant trees, for example.
[01:04:37.352 --> 01:04:39.113]  It doesn't do anything, the Olympus thing.
[01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:39.934]  It doesn't help.
[01:04:39.994 --> 01:04:40.674]  And I don't think he's gay.
[01:04:40.694 --> 01:04:42.076]  I just think he's, like, weak, you know?
[01:04:42.396 --> 01:04:48.621]  And if you don't have strong grip strength, you can, like, extend into your wrist to the point where, you know, eventually you just look like Stephen Hawking.
[01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:50.703]  But yeah, I don't plant trees.
[01:04:50.783 --> 01:04:51.343]  It doesn't work.
[01:04:51.403 --> 01:04:57.929]  I just, you know, put poison on all the mosquito nets that are then used by people in third world countries to fish.
[01:04:58.389 --> 01:05:00.591]  So when they eat the fish, they're themselves poisoned.
[01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:01.991]  We're good.
[01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:21.519]  I don't
[01:05:40.282 --> 01:05:46.707]  Would use a net for multiple things if they were poor, like just because you would buy a fishing net and a bed net because you're so rich.
[01:05:47.187 --> 01:05:50.710]  Even to be in close proximity to poison.
[01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.271]  How much poison was there?
[01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:52.992]  Why are you doing that?
[01:05:53.012 --> 01:06:01.078]  But they've been running eugenics programs in Africa for, you know, as long as I've been alive, they're doing one right now again with mpox.
[01:06:01.198 --> 01:06:01.378]  Yes.
[01:06:02.264 --> 01:06:07.688]  You know, approving emergency use authorization for children.
[01:06:07.948 --> 01:06:08.188]  Yes.
[01:06:08.369 --> 01:06:09.569]  They want to inject all the kids.
[01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:11.991]  It's unbelievable, Chase.
[01:06:12.031 --> 01:06:14.493]  And all the infertility that they've caused in those countries.
[01:06:14.533 --> 01:06:15.314]  Him and Tedros.
[01:06:15.654 --> 01:06:16.695]  Terrorist Tedros.
[01:06:17.235 --> 01:06:17.815]  It's sickening.
[01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:18.636]  It's sickening.
[01:06:18.756 --> 01:06:20.517]  And this is who these people are, by the way.
[01:06:20.537 --> 01:06:23.700]  This is who these people are.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.742]  Maybe they don't even know it.
[01:06:27.302 --> 01:06:28.603]  But these are the same people.
[01:06:28.623 --> 01:06:30.485]  Do we want to hear Mindy?
[01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:32.691]  We do, but finish your point first.
[01:06:32.731 --> 01:06:33.451]  You're more important.
[01:06:33.611 --> 01:06:37.954]  These are the same people that went out and supported mandates.
[01:06:38.014 --> 01:06:46.840]  These are the same people that told you, these paid celebrities that told you to wear a muzzle that does absolutely nothing so that you can be a slave.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.102]  And now they're telling everyone watching, you know, all these
[01:06:51.002 --> 01:06:52.843]  Well it's like, it's wartime humor.
[01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:10.949]  She was complimenting me every step of the way.
[01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:12.670]  Making sure that my daughter, Kit, heard how good of a cook I am.
[01:07:37.995 --> 01:07:41.818]  She had no desire to be seen as better than anyone else.
[01:07:41.838 --> 01:07:45.700]  She just wanted my kid to be impressed with her mom.
[01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:47.641]  You're right, I didn't notice.
[01:07:48.122 --> 01:07:55.367]  And when she finally, and when she finally bit into my dosa, she looked at me and said, mmm, really good!
[01:07:55.407 --> 01:07:57.188]  And then never took another bite again.
[01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.829]  Yes, yes.
[01:07:59.029 --> 01:08:01.551]  You know, I didn't know back then, I didn't care, I just tuned out.
[01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.532]  Ten years ago, everything was different.
[01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:05.930]  Mindy's Indian too, right?
[01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:06.491]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:07.591]  They're related.
[01:08:07.731 --> 01:08:08.271]  She's Mace Hindu.
[01:08:22.616 --> 01:08:25.659]  They keep bringing up her mother and her family ties, Kamala.
[01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:27.140]  They're trying to humanize us.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:27.400]  Yeah.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.782]  And she's not a mother herself, so they have to associate her with another mother?
[01:08:30.822 --> 01:08:31.042]  Yeah.
[01:08:31.062 --> 01:08:33.684]  Your next speaker of the house, Hakeem Jeffries.
[01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:38.488]  Your next speaker of the house, Hakeem!
[01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.469]  The Hakeem regime!
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:43.691]  Walking out in his suit and tennis shoes like he gets it.
[01:08:44.192 --> 01:08:45.813]  We in these streets.
[01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:49.635]  Good evening, Democrats!
[01:08:49.675 --> 01:08:51.577]  Look at that pink tie.
[01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:54.282]  It's not the Democrats watching you, Hakeem.
[01:08:54.382 --> 01:08:55.763]  The Democrats do know how to dress better.
[01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:56.084]  Some of them.
[01:08:56.104 --> 01:08:56.204]  Some?
[01:08:56.244 --> 01:08:58.025]  He looks like a gayer, blacker version of Peter Thiel.
[01:08:58.045 --> 01:09:01.307]  Why does he move his hands with every syllable?
[01:09:01.347 --> 01:09:02.368]  I don't know.
[01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:04.489]  Sometimes I do that when I'm nervous.
[01:09:19.384 --> 01:09:20.784]  Maybe I do that, and I'm not even aware.
[01:09:20.944 --> 01:09:21.424]  I don't know.
[01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:22.025]  I do this thing.
[01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.345]  Not the racist whites, but I do that.
[01:09:24.445 --> 01:09:26.706]  Not when I'm nervous, but when I'm really zooming in.
[01:09:27.346 --> 01:09:28.926]  He's just anxious, I think, though.
[01:09:29.226 --> 01:09:29.686]  Maybe.
[01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.527]  That's the thing that's weird about being in a studio like this.
[01:09:32.747 --> 01:09:36.228]  You don't see the audience, so you don't realize there's like a million people listening.
[01:09:36.408 --> 01:09:36.688]  Yes.
[01:09:36.888 --> 01:09:37.068]  You know?
[01:09:37.088 --> 01:09:40.849]  And then you go out there, and maybe there's 5,000 people, and you're like, oh my god, so many people!
[01:09:41.049 --> 01:09:42.869]  But every day on the radio, it's way more, you know?
[01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:44.410]  It's totally different, you're right.
[01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:50.054]  And sometimes difficult to tell the impact as well when you're not in front of people.
[01:09:50.174 --> 01:09:51.154]  Yeah.
[01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:57.759]  Like, even people at least seeing you, you're not seeing the people that watch the broadcast.
[01:09:57.859 --> 01:09:58.339]  Absolutely.
[01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:01.421]  Except for when they call and then you get a sense, like, oh wow, people are listening.
[01:10:01.441 --> 01:10:06.665]  And when you check social media later and you see replies to certain things, like, wow, I wasn't just talking to the crew.
[01:10:07.145 --> 01:10:10.748]  But you know, I've had the privilege of guest hosting all the shows on this network.
[01:10:11.348 --> 01:10:30.459]  So I've been in the American Journal Studio, I've been in the War Room Studio and this studio particularly I find intimidating because it's got the highest ceiling and it's like the lights are so bright that you almost feel like you're orbiting in space speaking to the abyss and the other ones are kind of cozy so you don't feel it's like more like a living room thing yeah right but I don't know if you felt that way when you first came into studio where you're just kind of like oh god
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.582]  I just, I've been listening to Alex for so many years.
[01:10:34.602 --> 01:10:34.822]  Yeah.
[01:10:35.362 --> 01:10:37.363]  And he impacted me even as a teenager.
[01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:37.783]  Yeah.
[01:10:37.923 --> 01:10:40.465]  So... Do you remember the first thing you came across of his?
[01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:41.125]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:10:41.265 --> 01:10:41.605]  Me too.
[01:10:41.785 --> 01:10:41.966]  Yeah.
[01:10:42.546 --> 01:10:43.066]  Wow.
[01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:44.047]  That's pretty cool.
[01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:44.387]  Yeah.
[01:10:44.527 --> 01:10:46.288]  I didn't come across it until 2012.
[01:10:46.488 --> 01:10:46.708]  Right.
[01:10:47.428 --> 01:10:48.229]  So it was YouTube.
[01:10:48.249 --> 01:10:48.549]  Yeah.
[01:10:48.569 --> 01:10:50.650]  But I saw it and I was like, holy shit, this is real?
[01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:51.030]  Yeah.
[01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:52.091]  Yeah.
[01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:54.032]  So since then you've just been kind of tuning in?
[01:10:54.622 --> 01:11:08.158]  Um, on and off, on and off, but I've been, you know, he really started me off on researching a lot of that, you know, and specifically the occultic nature of those that are in control.
[01:11:09.419 --> 01:11:15.226]  And, you know, my dad and I were watching that together, you know, so it's pretty cool being here.
[01:11:15.854 --> 01:11:17.275]  It's amazing to see some of the new footage.
[01:11:17.295 --> 01:11:20.977]  I don't know if you had a chance to glance at it, but Alex actually went back to Bohemian Grub this year.
[01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:22.117]  I heard.
[01:11:22.137 --> 01:11:26.119]  And he met up with who we fondly refer to as the Bohemians.
[01:11:26.359 --> 01:11:27.880]  They're like 20-year-old kids.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.922]  I don't want to speak disparagingly of them.
[01:11:31.942 --> 01:11:33.223]  I don't mean this with a negative connotation.
[01:11:33.243 --> 01:11:35.904]  They seem like stoner conspiracy theorist kids, right?
[01:11:36.184 --> 01:11:39.607]  That infiltrated Bohemian Grove by getting jobs there, right?
[01:11:39.647 --> 01:11:40.367]  The Bohemians.
[01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:42.669]  And they got HD footage of all the same rituals.
[01:11:42.689 --> 01:11:47.413]  So you can, like, we should actually go back and remaster Alex Jones's Bohemian Grove documentary.
[01:11:47.453 --> 01:11:51.797]  Yeah, or just, like, just overlay even, like, the same points.
[01:11:52.137 --> 01:11:59.022]  We should do that and do a re-release and maybe do a fundraiser where you can pay $17.76 for it or something with, like, special comments from Alex or a card or something.
[01:11:59.042 --> 01:11:59.323]  I don't know.
[01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:00.163]  We'll figure that out.
[01:12:02.453 --> 01:12:06.114]  But it's just amazing to see the work that he's done.
[01:12:06.134 --> 01:12:15.357]  But I found that I started listening to Alex Jones when I wanted more news and the mainstream news was stuck in a loop.
[01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:24.279]  Because when things are easy and there's not a lot of breaking news and politics going on, it was enough for me to just watch Tucker's monologue every night on Fox when he was on Fox, right?
[01:12:24.759 --> 01:12:32.285]  But then when you want an update maybe every four hours because holy shit they just declared it an insurrection what happened on January 6th.
[01:12:32.626 --> 01:12:45.456]  There's no other place to go than InfoWars because you're gonna see the same marquee on every other network with the same talking points on every other network whether the right wing or left wing but that there's like nine hours of original content and genuine opinions on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:48.579]  That was when I got into it until Roku took their channel off.
[01:12:49.039 --> 01:12:49.379]  Right.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.462]  And so I figured it out, but yeah, it's been amazing.
[01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:56.466]  So was it surreal for you to sit in the chair having listened to Alex Jones for years?
[01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:56.947]  It was.
[01:12:57.307 --> 01:12:57.587]  It was.
[01:12:57.687 --> 01:12:59.529]  And I felt extremely honored, you know?
[01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:00.130]  Oh, of course, yeah.
[01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:01.591]  Extremely honored.
[01:13:01.691 --> 01:13:05.175]  But I admire him so much, and he's changed so many lives.
[01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:05.415]  Yeah.
[01:13:05.655 --> 01:13:09.679]  And like I said, it's sometimes even hard to gauge that, you know, he's been on air for so many years.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:19.810]  But the reason that that I said this to him that day, when you guys all thought that they were going to shut you down and it was going to be the last broadcast, you know, that X space that we did.
[01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:25.776]  And I said, yeah, I know we're fading the lights down and playing my way by Frank Sinatra at the end.
[01:13:27.384 --> 01:13:36.286]  And I said, you know, when you say it's not it's not cliche at all to say that we're all Info Wars and we're all Alex Jones these days.
[01:13:36.426 --> 01:13:46.629]  It is thanks to him that so many, you know, you can find a lot of Alex Jones like content or topics at least that people weren't discussing even five years ago, Chase.
[01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:47.169]  Yes.
[01:13:47.649 --> 01:13:56.673]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:13:56.893 --> 01:14:04.657]  And the crazy thing is, people always ask me, I don't know if you've been asked this, and I'd love to hear the story about the first time you met him.
[01:14:05.217 --> 01:14:12.060]  Because the first time I really met him, I was on air with him before I really met him, you know, because you come in and it's just like we're doing a segment and it's different.
[01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:14.612]  It was a couple of weeks after I was hired here.
[01:14:14.652 --> 01:14:19.194]  He came into my office, which at the time was in the other building and like a literally like a broom closet.
[01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.374]  It was like Harry Potter's office.
[01:14:21.515 --> 01:14:24.796]  And, um, first thing he says to me is crazy what the Globals are doing out there.
[01:14:24.816 --> 01:14:29.018]  I'm like, Oh, my God, he's exactly the same off air as he is on the show.
[01:14:29.098 --> 01:14:30.778]  Actually, he's even more intense in person.
[01:14:30.798 --> 01:14:31.979]  Did you have a similar experience?
[01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:34.440]  Like it's not an act like he is the guy you see.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.041]  I can attest to that.
[01:14:37.141 --> 01:14:41.083]  But the first time I met him, he I was actually here.
[01:14:41.163 --> 01:14:41.343]  It was
[01:14:42.358 --> 01:14:46.544]  This time around when I've come to to America last time, I didn't actually see him.
[01:14:46.564 --> 01:14:47.205]  Yeah.
[01:14:47.445 --> 01:14:51.030]  But I walked in and he was running late.
[01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:52.351]  Well, he wasn't running late.
[01:14:52.371 --> 01:14:53.513]  He was just running over, I mean.
[01:14:53.533 --> 01:14:54.254]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.514 --> 01:14:57.518]  And he's like, oh, I didn't realize you were here if I knew I would have finished earlier.
[01:14:57.578 --> 01:14:58.099]  And he walked off.
[01:14:58.159 --> 01:14:58.480]  That was it.
[01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:00.321]  Straight to work, Maria.
[01:15:00.582 --> 01:15:00.922]  That's it.
[01:15:00.942 --> 01:15:01.222]  That's it.
[01:15:01.242 --> 01:15:02.403]  You know, that's how he is.
[01:15:02.423 --> 01:15:05.626]  He's just so on all the time.
[01:15:05.786 --> 01:15:06.067]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.347 --> 01:15:06.467]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.507 --> 01:15:20.620]  Well, the nice thing about the situation that he's in, you know, being sued for $1.5 billion and all this just attacks and, you know, worrying about your life, literally, is that he can always say that the reason he's late is because he was in a meeting with the lawyers and everybody just immediately believes it.
[01:15:23.243 --> 01:15:40.499]  And he is always in meetings with lawyers and it is so busy, but thank God for the InfoWars audience for keeping us on the air because if it wasn't for you guys, you listeners out there going to InfoWarsStore.com and buying our products, experiencing their benefits, and sharing the broadcast with
[01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:47.394]  Literally millions upon millions of people now at this point, millions upon millions of times, and we wouldn't be on the air.
[01:15:47.434 --> 01:15:49.375]  So please go to Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:55.358]  Find something that you think would help you, and I guarantee you it's the highest quality, best deal you can for that quality of a product.
[01:15:55.878 --> 01:16:03.141]  And we are going to Hillary very shortly, so we're going to cut into the DNC broadcast right now, as I believe we will be joined by Rex Jones as well.
[01:16:04.422 --> 01:16:05.442]  And this is going to be awesome.
[01:16:05.462 --> 01:16:05.983]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:06.323 --> 01:16:06.663]  Stay tuned.
[01:16:15.894 --> 01:16:17.595]  There are only 76 days left.
[01:16:18.436 --> 01:16:20.798]  We must continue to speak up.
[01:16:21.278 --> 01:16:23.019]  We must continue to show up.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:29.944]  We must continue to stand up, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans.
[01:16:30.265 --> 01:16:37.590]  And when we do, nothing can stop Kamala Harris from becoming the 47th President of the United States of America.
[01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:42.671]  Nothing can stop House Democrats from taking back the majority.
[01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:49.153]  Nothing can stop the American people from continuing our march toward a more perfect union.
[01:16:49.453 --> 01:16:50.873]  Nothing can stop us.
[01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.513]  We're all the way up.
[01:16:53.153 --> 01:16:53.974]  God bless you.
[01:16:54.654 --> 01:16:55.914]  God bless Kamala Harris.
[01:16:56.394 --> 01:16:59.375]  May God bless the United States of America.
[01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:17.648]  You wanna go outside today?
[01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:17.788]  Yeah.
[01:17:17.808 --> 01:17:19.529]  You wanna go put your shoes on?
[01:17:19.549 --> 01:17:19.609]  Yes.
[01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:21.550]  Let's go outside.
[01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.311]  Ruby is two years old.
[01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:26.632]  I'm starting to think, will she be an air worker like her dad?
[01:17:28.773 --> 01:17:30.514]  I hate to break it to you, but I'm not a billionaire.
[01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:38.507]  Donald Trump talked a big game about bringing jobs back to America, but it was all talk.
[01:17:39.127 --> 01:17:39.887]  Like Foxconn.
[01:17:40.368 --> 01:17:42.329]  This is the eighth wonder of the world.
[01:17:42.409 --> 01:17:48.611]  Foxconn, by most estimates, has not even come close to meeting expectations.
[01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:51.273]  This whole project was a scam.
[01:17:51.553 --> 01:17:53.634]  He is not looking out for the residents.
[01:17:53.694 --> 01:17:55.114]  He's looking out for himself.
[01:17:57.936 --> 01:17:58.756]  You know what Trump delivered?
[01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:04.374]  Two trillion dollars in tax cuts focused on his billionaire buddies and big corporations.
[01:18:04.694 --> 01:18:05.996]  That rips as hell.
[01:18:06.276 --> 01:18:07.337]  It makes me angry.
[01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:09.599]  Billionaires don't pay their share of the load.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.722]  And he wants to do that again.
[01:18:12.222 --> 01:18:14.825]  Trump talked a massive game about infrastructure.
[01:18:14.945 --> 01:18:15.506]  What a joke.
[01:18:15.806 --> 01:18:17.248]  We call it Infrastructure Week.
[01:18:17.608 --> 01:18:19.570]  Infrastructure is the easiest of all.
[01:18:19.891 --> 01:18:21.472]  We're gonna get this infrastructure.
[01:18:22.253 --> 01:18:22.573]  Got one.
[01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:25.235]  Trump was too incompetent to get it done.
[01:18:25.855 --> 01:18:26.975]  Who's he looking out for?
[01:18:27.215 --> 01:18:28.756]  Not us, not my family.
[01:18:29.757 --> 01:18:30.977]  You know who got it done?
[01:18:31.157 --> 01:18:32.498]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
[01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:36.560]  We've just been letting this run the whole time without talking crap.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.442]  They got windmills that break down so Texas freezes and dozens of people die without allowing any coal.
[01:18:41.742 --> 01:18:47.905]  They claim to be bringing manufacturing back because for some reason they think it's every American's dream to work in a factory.
[01:18:49.666 --> 01:18:50.647]  What do you think, Rexy?
[01:18:50.867 --> 01:18:51.608]  When are we live?
[01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:52.448]  We're live now.
[01:18:52.588 --> 01:18:53.349]  Oh, we've been live.
[01:18:53.409 --> 01:18:55.370]  Oh, you didn't realize I was performing?
[01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:56.671]  No, yeah, what a surprise.
[01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:58.813]  You're just too naturally good, Chase.
[01:18:58.893 --> 01:18:59.954]  Rex, what do you think, man?
[01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:01.995]  I'm just shocked by all of it.
[01:19:02.135 --> 01:19:13.724]  I mean, the whole point and the whole reason why I wanted to come on air today, the thing that kind of just germinated in my mind was when good ol' Hillary Clinton got up there and was just gloating and reveling in the lock him up chants.
[01:19:13.804 --> 01:19:14.985]  And that was just too much for me.
[01:19:15.065 --> 01:19:15.745]  And I was like, I'm out.
[01:19:15.845 --> 01:19:16.706]  I gotta come on the line.
[01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:17.806]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:17.826 --> 01:19:18.647]  Wasn't that disgusting?
[01:19:18.907 --> 01:19:19.807]  It was disgusting.
[01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:23.929]  And she looked like she had been, like, injected with adrenochrome or something.
[01:19:23.949 --> 01:19:25.810]  There was a new level of vibrance.
[01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.091]  Did you notice that there was... Yes.
[01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:27.871]  Like, she'd been zapped.
[01:19:27.951 --> 01:19:32.574]  Like, I don't know if it was... I don't know if she had a lobotomy or if it was, like, a electrotherapy.
[01:19:32.594 --> 01:19:32.794]  Lobotomy!
[01:19:33.114 --> 01:19:34.115]  What'd you think?
[01:19:34.175 --> 01:19:34.815]  Did you notice it, though?
[01:19:34.835 --> 01:19:35.395]  What's going on?
[01:19:35.755 --> 01:19:36.836]  I don't know, but she did.
[01:19:36.916 --> 01:19:38.097]  She looked very vibrant.
[01:19:38.137 --> 01:19:39.077]  Oh, there's Bill, guys.
[01:19:39.097 --> 01:19:40.097]  We gotta cut straight to Bill.
[01:19:40.298 --> 01:19:40.838]  I'm back!
[01:19:42.927 --> 01:19:44.007]  I'm on the stage!
[01:19:44.387 --> 01:19:46.008]  Now Hillary, didn't Hillary do a great job?
[01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:51.209]  Now, I'll tell you something, this is the first time I've ever said it, it's true, I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:53.909]  Oh, he's on the good drugs tonight, look at him.
[01:19:54.109 --> 01:19:55.610]  You know, I think he's always had it.
[01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:59.350]  He's definitely an evil pervert, but he's a smart guy.
[01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:02.451]  Oh yeah, but if you're that old, you need to... How old is he?
[01:20:02.471 --> 01:20:05.052]  A guy who looks better than Joe.
[01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:06.672]  He does look better.
[01:20:06.752 --> 01:20:07.532]  Yes, he does.
[01:20:07.972 --> 01:20:08.632]  How old is he?
[01:20:10.053 --> 01:20:10.433]  Thank you.
[01:20:10.453 --> 01:20:11.153]  I did it.
[01:20:15.482 --> 01:20:15.982]  I gotta cheer.
[01:20:16.022 --> 01:20:18.264]  I gotta cheer for Bill Clinton.
[01:20:18.304 --> 01:20:19.945]  Rape accusations, I gotta cheer for it.
[01:20:27.171 --> 01:20:33.055]  What am I asking for?
[01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:34.276]  After the last two days.
[01:20:35.817 --> 01:20:38.259]  It's bizarre how much Bill Clinton looks like Hillary Clinton.
[01:20:42.887 --> 01:20:44.027]  Those kinds of people do.
[01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:44.928]  Yeah, they like mold.
[01:20:45.348 --> 01:20:47.489]  Like a melting pot of evil.
[01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:52.192]  They engage in incestuous... incestuous... You think they're brothers?
[01:20:52.212 --> 01:20:52.872]  I could be.
[01:20:53.393 --> 01:20:56.635]  Hey, is that not a marriage based on truth at the end of the day?
[01:20:56.655 --> 01:20:58.636]  Because they've always been family.
[01:20:58.656 --> 01:21:00.897]  Because she grew up.
[01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:01.597]  She grew up hot.
[01:21:01.637 --> 01:21:03.859]  She wasn't going to let anybody else marry her.
[01:21:04.439 --> 01:21:05.920]  I said, Hillary, I'm going to run for president.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.661]  I love seeing the Obamas here.
[01:21:07.761 --> 01:21:09.262]  I love seeing President Biden.
[01:21:11.741 --> 01:21:15.964]  And I thought Hillary gave a great speech, too.
[01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:17.045]  I knew it!
[01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:17.925]  I knew it!
[01:21:18.606 --> 01:21:21.388]  I'll tell you what, I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[01:21:21.688 --> 01:21:22.669]  A supportive spouse.
[01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:29.173]  But I love seeing all these young leaders.
[01:21:29.193 --> 01:21:31.855]  A bunch of them are coming up after me.
[01:21:32.815 --> 01:21:34.076]  What if he wouldn't have mentioned her once?
[01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:40.576]  Well, I've always been curious if they actually loved or hated each other.
[01:21:40.636 --> 01:21:42.438]  Oh my god, they just cut to Monica in the front row.
[01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:49.045]  Radio listeners are going for a trip right now.
[01:21:57.435 --> 01:21:57.655]  What?
[01:21:58.316 --> 01:22:01.758]  And we were in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crash.
[01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:06.440]  Because of the measures you took to manage... He healed our sick.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:06.981]  The sniffles.
[01:22:07.001 --> 01:22:08.462]  And put the rest of us back to work.
[01:22:09.082 --> 01:22:10.123]  His voice is sharp.
[01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:11.483]  He healed our sick?
[01:22:12.964 --> 01:22:13.705]  Who's healed, man?
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.682]  Doesn't protect against transmission, infection, doesn't stop transmission.
[01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:21.483]  How dare you?
[01:22:21.984 --> 01:22:24.545]  How dare you talk badly about the vaccine?
[01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:30.228]  Yeah, we're trying to get CNN ad space here.
[01:22:30.268 --> 01:22:33.250]  And then he did something that's really hard for a politician to do.
[01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:36.932]  He voluntarily gave up political power.
[01:22:37.939 --> 01:22:41.320]  Voluntarily, they blackmailed him with the 25th Amendment.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.641]  That stubborn bastard didn't volunteer anything.
[01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:46.202]  Emperor Palpatine volunteered to fall down the reactor.
[01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:47.882]  He volunteered for it.
[01:22:47.902 --> 01:22:48.563]  It's very important.
[01:22:49.123 --> 01:22:50.163]  Very important.
[01:22:50.843 --> 01:22:53.604]  For us serving two terms before it was mandatory.
[01:22:55.485 --> 01:22:56.725]  It helped his legacy.
[01:22:57.966 --> 01:23:00.187]  And it will enhance Joe Biden's legacy.
[01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:12.140]  And it's a stark contrast... He has the same exact haircut as my late grandmother.
[01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.063]  So I want to thank him.
[01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:18.926]  You need to talk to your late grandmother about that.
[01:23:19.026 --> 01:23:22.789]  I understand, but... He really is greatest generation, Max.
[01:23:26.172 --> 01:23:26.793]  Thank you.
[01:23:27.673 --> 01:23:27.934]  And...
[01:23:39.488 --> 01:23:40.108]  Thank you guys.
[01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:40.668]  For what?
[01:23:40.908 --> 01:23:41.469]  For what?
[01:23:41.789 --> 01:23:42.969]  Alright, this is great.
[01:23:42.989 --> 01:23:46.470]  We've got cheers for not just one, but two rapists on stage.
[01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:47.991]  This is fantastic.
[01:23:48.031 --> 01:23:49.131]  It's never been done before.
[01:23:49.531 --> 01:23:53.793]  At this large a scale with millions of viewers, we got two rapists getting cheered at the same time.
[01:23:53.813 --> 01:23:57.974]  This hasn't happened since the crowd gave 6 Meter and Roy a standing ovation.
[01:23:59.955 --> 01:24:01.375]  Who's Juanita Broderick?
[01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:02.015]  I don't know.
[01:24:02.035 --> 01:24:03.336]  I don't know who she is.
[01:24:04.356 --> 01:24:04.736]  Liar.
[01:24:04.756 --> 01:24:06.497]  I think Mike is watching right now.
[01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:09.385]  I think all the victims are, perhaps.
[01:24:09.465 --> 01:24:10.466]  I don't think it's just one.
[01:24:10.666 --> 01:24:16.307]  How much did you practice that impression?
[01:24:16.327 --> 01:24:20.428]  I've always been able to.
[01:24:20.788 --> 01:24:22.308]  It's like the back of your throat.
[01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:24.509]  I had a teacher that sounded a lot like him.
[01:24:24.689 --> 01:24:25.389]  Oh, really?
[01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:25.729]  Yep.
[01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.129]  Chelsea?
[01:24:27.789 --> 01:24:28.589]  No.
[01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:29.330]  No.
[01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:32.490]  Tell me who's vice principal.
[01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:34.371]  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[01:24:37.088 --> 01:24:37.829]  You said Kamala, right?
[01:24:38.769 --> 01:24:39.810]  Just think about that.
[01:24:41.371 --> 01:24:46.916]  Two leaders with all-American but still improbable life stories.
[01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:50.882]  Everybody's life story is improbable.
[01:24:51.263 --> 01:24:57.427]  It is improbable to, like, lock up hundreds of black people, like, all the time, you know, for weed so you can have free labor in your city.
[01:24:57.447 --> 01:24:58.128]  How'd you pull that off?
[01:24:58.148 --> 01:25:00.049]  I don't know, I rolled the dice and I got lucky.
[01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:07.695]  Well, you know, good old Kamala, and we are talking over the speech, but Kamala was listening to Tupac when she was, like, 11 years old, apparently.
[01:25:07.715 --> 01:25:08.576]  Is that what she said?
[01:25:08.596 --> 01:25:10.237]  That's what she said, so, you know.
[01:25:10.257 --> 01:25:11.198]  Was he rapping when she was 11?
[01:25:11.258 --> 01:25:12.699]  No, it's just a total lie.
[01:25:12.999 --> 01:25:13.800]  That's what these people do.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.340]  Oh my god.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.141]  Let's go back to the speech.
[01:25:15.221 --> 01:25:18.524]  Also not typical of Indian families, that type of music.
[01:25:19.284 --> 01:25:24.266]  Well, if you believe in reincarnation, you could actually make the case that Tupac was rapping to you in another form.
[01:25:25.206 --> 01:25:32.009]  Secondly, the Constitution says we, the people, get to do the hiring.
[01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:37.031]  You know what the Declaration of Independence says, right, asshole?
[01:25:39.652 --> 01:25:44.034]  That every four years, we get to change the requirements for the job.
[01:25:46.328 --> 01:25:48.009]  We get to rewrite the Constitution.
[01:25:48.029 --> 01:25:50.050]  So here's what I'm thinking.
[01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:53.911]  Because I try to apply this in every election.
[01:25:54.351 --> 01:25:58.813]  Will this president take us backward or forward?
[01:26:00.574 --> 01:26:01.574]  Straight down.
[01:26:01.594 --> 01:26:06.436]  Do you want to go back to the way things were in the 90s when I was president?
[01:26:06.496 --> 01:26:06.756]  No.
[01:26:07.897 --> 01:26:08.617]  Actually, kind of.
[01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:22.539]  I just don't understand how the people that are fans of the Democrats, these people in the audience, cannot understand how stupid someone like Bill Clinton thinks that they are.
[01:26:23.039 --> 01:26:23.299]  Yeah.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:24.960]  Like he hates you.
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:25.441]  Yeah.
[01:26:25.661 --> 01:26:26.881]  He thinks you are so dumb.
[01:26:27.162 --> 01:26:30.884]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Michelle and Barack, Big Mike and Barack.
[01:26:32.113 --> 01:26:40.215]  The difference between them and I think this new class of Democratic leaders is they are really good at making the leftist ideology like an easy pill to swallow.
[01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:41.796]  They're smooth, right?
[01:26:41.816 --> 01:26:43.116]  They're pro-villains.
[01:26:44.097 --> 01:26:54.900]  I think having people like this speak actually makes Kamala and Tim Walz look inferior because the amount of energy and excitement and just comfort with the lethal injection that is leftism
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.522]  It's so much harder to swallow and absorb and accept when you hear it from Tim Walz, Kamala Harrison, from Bill Clinton.
[01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:04.523]  I mean, I despise everything he's saying and disagree with it.
[01:27:04.903 --> 01:27:05.743]  The dude is a charmer.
[01:27:05.763 --> 01:27:07.604]  I mean, if he was here right now, we'd be laughing.
[01:27:07.804 --> 01:27:10.304]  We'd forget that he was a rapist for 15 minutes, you know?
[01:27:10.885 --> 01:27:11.325]  I would not.
[01:27:11.705 --> 01:27:13.105]  You probably wouldn't, I understand.
[01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.206]  But like, having a beer with this guy, he would make it easy.
[01:27:15.546 --> 01:27:16.306]  Here's the thing, right?
[01:27:16.386 --> 01:27:19.447]  This guy's a true... I like to call them demons of the ancient world.
[01:27:19.707 --> 01:27:20.007]  Yes.
[01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.848]  This guy's like a Balrog rebel threat.
[01:27:22.048 --> 01:27:22.428]  Yes.
[01:27:22.468 --> 01:27:23.809]  He's very, very much so.
[01:27:23.829 --> 01:27:25.950]  He knows how to crack the whip efficiently.
[01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.950]  Exactly.
[01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:28.551]  You just have to have the balls to say, I want to.
[01:27:28.651 --> 01:27:31.272]  What are they saying when they keep repeating this line?
[01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:34.253]  Are we going to have a president that takes us forward or backward?
[01:27:34.433 --> 01:27:34.853]  Yeah.
[01:27:35.474 --> 01:27:36.434]  What does that mean?
[01:27:36.494 --> 01:27:42.096]  Like these people in the audience that are sitting there, they have such contempt for you that they don't even articulate what that means to you.
[01:27:42.416 --> 01:27:42.616]  Right.
[01:27:43.337 --> 01:27:48.499]  All they've given, all they've alluded to is we can't keep killing babies if Trump gets elected.
[01:27:48.579 --> 01:27:51.080]  You know, that's literally their version of backward.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:51.660]  Right.
[01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:55.946]  If you look literally at the policies that they advocate, it's a death cult.
[01:27:56.346 --> 01:28:02.995]  But when they speak in grand terms, it sounds like, of course, if we're not happy with the way things are, then getting through it makes sense.
[01:28:03.015 --> 01:28:08.262]  So they just use words like progressive and forward because progress has a positive connotation.
[01:28:08.542 --> 01:28:10.423]  And forward has a positive connotation.
[01:28:10.443 --> 01:28:11.684]  It's almost like victory in battle.
[01:28:11.964 --> 01:28:13.806]  It's moving through a time that's bad.
[01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:17.208]  But then when you look at the specifics, which they don't even want, they don't want you to look under the hood.
[01:28:17.228 --> 01:28:22.031]  They're trying to sell you a broken down car that has a really nice body, right?
[01:28:22.051 --> 01:28:22.771]  It's painted up.
[01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:23.572]  It looks great.
[01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.172]  It's shiny.
[01:28:24.192 --> 01:28:26.754]  The leather is great in the interior, but it doesn't start.
[01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:30.156]  Or if it does start, it drives you right off the cliffs because the brakes don't work, right?
[01:28:30.577 --> 01:28:32.698]  So that, yeah, they stay with this like abstract.
[01:28:32.972 --> 01:28:35.653]  The Democrats are the car salesmen from Matilda.
[01:28:35.693 --> 01:28:37.013]  It's a great role by Danny DeVito.
[01:28:37.233 --> 01:28:37.533]  Yes.
[01:28:37.553 --> 01:28:38.434]  Phenomenal movie.
[01:28:38.534 --> 01:28:42.595]  Fills the engine with sawdust and then it drives for like 100 miles and then it breaks down.
[01:28:43.055 --> 01:28:43.956]  That's who these people are.
[01:28:44.636 --> 01:28:46.576]  They're the Matilda character.
[01:28:47.117 --> 01:28:47.777]  Alright, back to Bill.
[01:28:48.737 --> 01:28:49.897]  I can't believe I said that.
[01:28:52.665 --> 01:28:53.406]  They always bring that up.
[01:28:53.466 --> 01:28:56.588]  She greeted every person with that thousand watt smile.
[01:28:56.648 --> 01:29:02.592]  So she's always been working for giant corporations and taking money from Fortune 500 companies.
[01:29:03.493 --> 01:29:06.255]  She's still asking, how can I help you?
[01:29:06.615 --> 01:29:10.438]  If I had worked there, I'd spat in people's faces.
[01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.298]  You have time to clean, Gil.
[01:29:11.318 --> 01:29:11.658]  Time to clean.
[01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:12.119]  Am I right?
[01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:12.679]  Camo hat.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:18.443]  I'd be so happy when she actually enters the White House as president.
[01:29:18.463 --> 01:29:20.124]  Tell us, Gil, how much was in the chicken when she worked there?
[01:29:20.145 --> 01:29:20.665]  How much was it?
[01:29:21.032 --> 01:29:27.603]  Because she will break my record as the president who spent the most time at McDonald's.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:34.193]  No, I'm relatable.
[01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.453]  I eat fast food.
[01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:36.494]  I eat the slop.
[01:29:36.654 --> 01:29:38.955]  I'm just like you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:39.015 --> 01:29:40.236]  Aren't I a good person?
[01:29:40.276 --> 01:29:41.637]  I eat the poison too.
[01:29:41.737 --> 01:29:45.299]  I don't even qualify someone for president.
[01:29:45.399 --> 01:29:48.100]  I spent the most time at McDonald's.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.122]  I don't know, they already killed the guy that did the documentary about it.
[01:29:51.322 --> 01:29:56.965]  Bill, you'd be more relatable if you just went on camera and admitted to doing something cool like Coke in the 80s or something.
[01:29:57.305 --> 01:29:59.046]  Which I'm sure you definitely did.
[01:29:59.126 --> 01:30:01.047]  But it's got to be fast food for Hillary.
[01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:01.868]  Very, very, very...
[01:30:02.228 --> 01:30:04.209]  I've always liked fast food and fast women.
[01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:07.911]  Back to Bill, please.
[01:30:10.273 --> 01:30:30.124]  Let me say, not a single day goes by, even though I've been gone for well over 23 years from the White House, not a day goes by that I don't thank the Lord for the chance I had to serve and what it meant.
[01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:33.744]  One of the reasons I love the job so much
[01:30:58.206 --> 01:31:01.689]  Hey, better blow jobs than no jobs, am I right?
[01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:03.531]  I don't know about that.
[01:31:03.851 --> 01:31:05.112]  I don't know about that, man.
[01:31:05.412 --> 01:31:06.773]  I don't know about that.
[01:31:06.813 --> 01:31:09.896]  If I was... I know the reason you like the job so much, Bill!
[01:31:10.096 --> 01:31:12.879]  If I was Bill and I was married to Hillary, I'd be celibate forever.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.560]  Till I die.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.282]  He's a member of the priest's class.
[01:31:16.342 --> 01:31:18.704]  Like, when you're a priest of Satan, you also don't have sex.
[01:31:19.912 --> 01:31:20.172]  Mm.
[01:31:20.232 --> 01:31:20.532]  Really?
[01:31:20.552 --> 01:31:24.593]  I'm not sure you have a lot of sex, I'm just... Yeah, I think that's in it.
[01:31:24.613 --> 01:31:30.294]  But he's married to Hillary, so... Hang on, these guys... These guys are known for abuse.
[01:31:30.594 --> 01:31:31.534]  Yeah.
[01:31:31.554 --> 01:31:40.036]  I miss the old 2000s-era InfoWars broadcasts that I watched as a child where Alex would talk about hits of poo and other things.
[01:31:40.336 --> 01:31:40.996]  Oh, yeah.
[01:31:41.236 --> 01:31:42.797]  After the Good Shepherd came out.
[01:31:42.817 --> 01:31:43.737]  Like Skull and Bones.
[01:31:43.757 --> 01:31:44.357]  Skull and Bones?
[01:31:44.537 --> 01:31:48.198]  Yeah, so... Not to get too graphic, but these people suck.
[01:31:48.418 --> 01:31:48.898]  Back to Bill.
[01:31:49.548 --> 01:31:50.508]  What am I gonna do with his voice?
[01:31:50.548 --> 01:31:52.809]  He mostly talks about himself.
[01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:54.629]  Right?
[01:31:56.729 --> 01:32:01.450]  So the next time you hear him, don't count the lies.
[01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:03.790]  Count the eyes.
[01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:15.352]  Count the eyes.
[01:32:15.372 --> 01:32:18.193]  His vendettas, his vengeance,
[01:32:19.369 --> 01:32:22.110]  His complaints, his conspiracies.
[01:32:25.412 --> 01:32:37.859]  He's like one of those tenors, opening up before he walks out on stage, like I did, trying to get his lungs open by singing, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:52.871]  When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with you, you, you, you.
[01:32:53.251 --> 01:32:58.252]  Oh my God, find the Alex Jones clip where he actually says you 23 times.
[01:32:58.712 --> 01:33:00.113]  What a horrible thing to say.
[01:33:00.133 --> 01:33:02.273]  It will all be about you.
[01:33:02.374 --> 01:33:03.914]  It will be you, you, you.
[01:33:04.014 --> 01:33:07.215]  I mean, people are too dumb now to understand that that's an evil message.
[01:33:07.755 --> 01:33:09.535]  One that's completely self-serving and vapid.
[01:33:09.555 --> 01:33:10.376]  Right.
[01:33:10.416 --> 01:33:11.836]  Based on just, like, vanity of self.
[01:33:12.016 --> 01:33:12.536]  That's very bad.
[01:33:12.556 --> 01:33:13.357]  That's a good point, Rex.
[01:33:13.417 --> 01:33:14.197]  I didn't think of that.
[01:33:14.257 --> 01:33:14.637]  Yeah.
[01:33:15.998 --> 01:33:43.300]  I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
[01:33:48.524 --> 01:33:50.305]  I swear I checked this three times.
[01:33:51.105 --> 01:33:52.265]  Even I couldn't believe it.
[01:33:53.406 --> 01:33:54.366]  What's the score?
[01:33:55.126 --> 01:33:57.067]  Democrats 50, Republicans 1.
[01:33:57.327 --> 01:34:06.050]  Is that like the Rice Purity Test or something?
[01:34:11.352 --> 01:34:12.752]  I don't know.
[01:34:12.792 --> 01:34:14.653]  He's talking about some skewed statistic.
[01:34:16.814 --> 01:34:17.754]  About new jobs.
[01:34:18.456 --> 01:34:34.085]  We saw that last jobs report that was released and how it was, the numbers were all fudged and essentially it was, you know, yeah.
[01:34:35.065 --> 01:34:41.509]  But even the most limited of us and what we know about football,
[01:34:43.226 --> 01:34:50.393]  Or any other sport knows that if you're not 50 and the other side's got one, you're ahead.
[01:34:53.996 --> 01:34:55.077]  That math doesn't math.
[01:34:55.557 --> 01:34:57.039]  It's not how a football game is scored.
[01:34:57.079 --> 01:34:58.400]  What about affordable housing?
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.861]  It's a terrible problem in America.
[01:34:59.881 --> 01:35:01.843]  He's got a shaky hand.
[01:35:02.283 --> 01:35:06.087]  And affordable health care.
[01:35:06.107 --> 01:35:09.390]  That's why the Democrats put a limit on
[01:35:11.027 --> 01:35:18.011]  Monthly payments for insulin and a $2,000 a year out-of-pocket limit.
[01:35:20.392 --> 01:35:25.195]  And they're trying to cover more drugs by mining prices.
[01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:28.696]  We need more financing for small businesses.
[01:35:31.518 --> 01:35:35.360]  We need still to strengthen our alliances.
[01:35:38.507 --> 01:35:45.334]  I almost croaked in the first debate of this election season.
[01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:47.055]  He's really struggling.
[01:35:47.095 --> 01:35:48.376]  He doesn't have it anymore.
[01:35:48.657 --> 01:35:49.738]  Put him back in storage.
[01:35:49.758 --> 01:35:52.981]  That's why they have him up and in for Nancy, not the other way around.
[01:35:53.341 --> 01:35:54.342]  Back to the cryo pod.
[01:35:54.402 --> 01:35:56.964]  He still looks like Bill, but he's not a fan.
[01:35:57.745 --> 01:35:58.125]  Wait, wait.
[01:35:59.206 --> 01:36:00.448]  And with a straight face.
[01:36:04.212 --> 01:36:06.113]  Look, you gotta give him, he's a good actor.
[01:36:06.713 --> 01:36:22.962]  With a straight face, he cited as evidence of the respect that existed for us when he was there, the presidents of North Korea and Russia.
[01:36:28.445 --> 01:36:31.987]  I'd rather have the people who respect us now.
[01:36:33.817 --> 01:36:52.831]  And one of the things is when you send a signal to the other countries, you want them to know whether they agree with you or not, at least that you're on the level.
[01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:55.072]  Here's where you are and what you believe.
[01:36:56.674 --> 01:36:58.135]  What are they supposed to make?
[01:36:59.124 --> 01:37:04.027]  To these endless tributes to the late, great Hannibal Lecter.
[01:37:11.971 --> 01:37:18.275]  I mean, President Obama once gave me the great honor of saying I was the explainer-in-chief.
[01:37:19.196 --> 01:37:23.238]  Folks, I've thought and thought about it, and I don't know what to say.
[01:37:36.371 --> 01:37:39.952]  Like Hakeem Jeffries, I too want an America that's more joyful.
[01:37:40.912 --> 01:37:42.472]  Oh, that Maoist joy crap.
[01:37:42.652 --> 01:37:44.473]  Oh, that's what Hakeem was talking about.
[01:37:44.553 --> 01:37:46.693]  He was actually quoting the Psalms.
[01:37:47.133 --> 01:37:48.413]  Joy will come in the morning.
[01:37:48.433 --> 01:37:50.854]  They're just all on this joy train.
[01:37:51.434 --> 01:37:55.895]  And he has the gall to quote the Bible in support of Kamala.
[01:37:55.935 --> 01:37:59.536]  Like, you know, because it's a biblical verse about joy, right?
[01:37:59.576 --> 01:38:00.936]  And her campaign's about joy.
[01:38:01.756 --> 01:38:06.918]  I remember when I used to be joyful, and Hillary would let me fill my Viagra prescription in peace.
[01:38:07.498 --> 01:38:10.779]  But those times are no more, and that's why you need to vote for Kamala.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:27.863]  She's already made her first presidential decision, and she knocked it out of the park when she asked Governor Tim Walz to be the nominee for Vice President.
[01:38:32.199 --> 01:38:34.260]  Good morning.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:34.900]  Good evening.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:35.961]  It was good evening.
[01:38:35.981 --> 01:38:37.642]  Have you seen that clip, Rex?
[01:38:37.702 --> 01:38:38.962]  No, I don't think so.
[01:38:39.503 --> 01:38:41.143]  Good evening.
[01:38:41.504 --> 01:38:44.765]  Good evening.
[01:38:44.865 --> 01:38:46.826]  I did it like 10 times.
[01:38:46.846 --> 01:38:49.007]  That was creepy.
[01:38:49.368 --> 01:38:51.389]  And Tim Walz is just there, open mouth.
[01:38:51.949 --> 01:38:53.189]  Oh, my God.
[01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:56.391]  As a teacher, as a coach.
[01:38:56.831 --> 01:38:59.873]  OK, here's some quotes on Joy from Mal.
[01:39:00.592 --> 01:39:01.052]  Let's see.
[01:39:01.112 --> 01:39:01.513]  Let's see.
[01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:21.210]  That was used.
[01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:24.051]  With Mao in our hearts, our joy knows no bounds.
[01:39:24.112 --> 01:39:25.593]  That's another one that was used as a slogan.
[01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.034]  Chairman Mao's thought leads us to happiness.
[01:39:28.434 --> 01:39:30.116]  You know, cognate for joy.
[01:39:30.136 --> 01:39:32.958]  Follow Mao, embrace joy, and build a new China.
[01:39:33.438 --> 01:39:36.240]  Under Chairman Mao's guidance, the people's joy is boundless.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:46.227]  This whole joy thing is Tim Waltz, Mao is trash, and they just figured out that it worked in the revolutionary China, so if they want to usher in communism here, they're going to use the same exact language that's not going to reinvent the wheel.
[01:39:46.247 --> 01:39:47.748]  They're just going to adopt Mao.
[01:39:48.308 --> 01:39:49.929]  I'm still stuck on the you, you, you thing.
[01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:51.950]  I found that to be very creepy.
[01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:55.973]  I think that should be clipped and thoroughly reviewed by everyone.
[01:39:56.173 --> 01:40:03.918]  Thanks for being a self-centered, really at its core infantile message that should not be one of a leading political party.
[01:40:03.938 --> 01:40:09.141]  Kamala Harris confronts an interesting dilemma.
[01:40:10.902 --> 01:40:13.244]  We're going to walk out of here feeling pretty good, I think.
[01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:15.391]  Those drugs.
[01:40:16.071 --> 01:40:19.192]  We've got energy, we are happy, we feel like a Lowe's offer.
[01:40:19.212 --> 01:40:19.772]  We're heffy.
[01:40:19.792 --> 01:40:22.352]  We've got energy and we feel happy.
[01:40:22.372 --> 01:40:24.953]  And we know we're just being asked to fight the same fight.
[01:40:25.973 --> 01:40:26.433]  Are my deaf?
[01:40:26.593 --> 01:40:30.154]  The best forces of progress have had to fight for 250 years.
[01:40:35.355 --> 01:40:41.276]  In the face of stiff and often violent opposition,
[01:40:44.136 --> 01:40:46.498]  We have to find a way to go forward together.
[01:40:46.538 --> 01:40:47.138]  This guy slipped.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:52.723]  Where we the people make our union more perfect.
[01:40:55.905 --> 01:40:59.288]  So... We said our union.
[01:40:59.308 --> 01:40:59.988]  That's a good thing.
[01:41:00.008 --> 01:41:01.970]  He was talking about the people being married to the state.
[01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:03.071]  How could we possibly lose?
[01:41:03.091 --> 01:41:04.752]  Like the union is in the United States of America.
[01:41:04.772 --> 01:41:07.034]  Kamala Harris has fought for kids her whole life.
[01:41:07.054 --> 01:41:07.914]  That's what I mean.
[01:41:07.954 --> 01:41:09.576]  That's certainly what liberal women think.
[01:41:10.056 --> 01:41:12.178]  That husband is the government.
[01:41:12.238 --> 01:41:13.719]  Well nobody else will marry him.
[01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:15.990]  You what, sorry?
[01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.772]  She said nobody else was there.
[01:41:18.269 --> 01:41:26.516]  Homeowners, she's been our leader in the fight for reproductive freedoms and we know a majority of American people are with us on that.
[01:41:26.696 --> 01:41:29.679]  She had like the, what's it called, a septum ring, you know, in her nose.
[01:41:29.699 --> 01:41:29.859]  Yeah.
[01:41:29.879 --> 01:41:30.800]  She had like a bunch of tattoos.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.964]  A pretty girl, like definitely a sexy girl, but like, you know, leftist tatted up thing, right?
[01:41:36.584 --> 01:41:41.568]  And she's like, oh my God, I just realized that men don't want to marry women that like look or act like me.
[01:41:41.969 --> 01:41:46.673]  Like they want to marry the sweet girl that's like loyal and honest and does traditional things.
[01:41:47.293 --> 01:41:52.177]  Like, it just hit me, like, men want to sleep with girls like me, but they don't want to marry me.
[01:41:52.198 --> 01:41:53.939]  Like, she was like... Kudos to her.
[01:41:53.959 --> 01:41:55.500]  She like, figured it out, you know.
[01:41:55.541 --> 01:42:01.005]  Kaylee was like, my wife Kaylee was like, oh my god, you're just now realizing that men don't marry women like you?
[01:42:01.706 --> 01:42:01.926]  Wow.
[01:42:01.966 --> 01:42:03.388]  You don't bring that one home to mom.
[01:42:04.148 --> 01:42:13.236]  Some activity going on outside as the DNC pretends that they're all so full of joy.
[01:42:14.946 --> 01:42:16.008]  We're so happy.
[01:42:16.088 --> 01:42:17.931]  People are getting arrested outside.
[01:42:18.211 --> 01:42:19.934]  If you're so happy, let the people in.
[01:42:20.034 --> 01:42:21.016]  Have the big party.
[01:42:21.096 --> 01:42:23.540]  It's a party time for Palestine.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.086]  Do the dance and everything because, you know, people are getting killed over there and you're ignoring it.
[01:42:27.386 --> 01:42:28.628]  I think that's a very big problem.
[01:42:28.989 --> 01:42:29.570]  Absolutely.
[01:42:33.377 --> 01:42:41.220]  I agree with you, Rex, that it's a problem that we're acting like Israel isn't doing anything wrong, but I also think that these protesters are lunatics in their own way.
[01:42:42.061 --> 01:42:44.922]  A lot of them are, but not all of them, Chase.
[01:42:44.942 --> 01:42:46.643]  Some of them are normal people.
[01:42:46.663 --> 01:42:50.424]  I know people that have family that they haven't spoken to for months.
[01:42:51.024 --> 01:42:52.445]  They don't know if they're dead or alive.
[01:42:53.205 --> 01:42:57.067]  They're just like terraforming over there basically with bombs and it's not good.
[01:42:57.107 --> 01:43:03.629]  They're trying to level the entire place because they understand that they've created an enemy that as long as it lives will never forgive them for the crimes it's committed.
[01:43:04.009 --> 01:43:07.650]  So the only solution to stabilize Israel is to commit a genocide into the surrounding regions.
[01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:08.811]  That's what they're doing.
[01:43:08.991 --> 01:43:11.712]  Isn't that a chilling look into our possible future?
[01:43:11.932 --> 01:43:12.652]  Absolutely it is.
[01:43:12.672 --> 01:43:14.813]  The one that we've made angry over the years.
[01:43:15.213 --> 01:43:16.113]  I think that's very chilling.
[01:43:16.674 --> 01:43:20.035]  Like Ron Paul said in 2008, it's called blowback!
[01:43:20.956 --> 01:43:21.296]  It's true.
[01:43:21.416 --> 01:43:22.237]  He's right, yeah.
[01:43:22.397 --> 01:43:23.018]  Famous for it.
[01:43:23.278 --> 01:43:26.661]  Could never have installed the Shaw.
[01:43:26.981 --> 01:43:28.102]  Look at our unity!
[01:43:28.122 --> 01:43:30.024]  Ponytail goes crazy.
[01:43:31.325 --> 01:43:33.087]  Check out the unity, guys!
[01:43:33.107 --> 01:43:35.269]  I think I went to college with that kid with the camera on the left.
[01:43:36.411 --> 01:43:42.013]  And you know, some people will say that this is not reflective, that, you know, not all of these protests... Look outside!
[01:43:42.033 --> 01:43:42.853]  Did you see that crowd?
[01:43:43.193 --> 01:43:50.016]  Not all of these protesters are actually Democrats, but that is not what our two earlier guests... Shades of 2020.
[01:43:50.076 --> 01:43:50.296]  ...said.
[01:43:50.316 --> 01:43:52.737]  Kriston Harris and Alex Stringer.
[01:43:52.797 --> 01:43:54.857]  What is being frantically photographed?
[01:43:54.897 --> 01:43:55.778]  Are they arresting that woman?
[01:43:55.818 --> 01:43:56.478]  Is that what's happening?
[01:43:58.473 --> 01:44:01.975]  Because those journalists are very anxious to get a photograph of what the cops are doing with that woman.
[01:44:02.055 --> 01:44:03.255]  Oh yeah, now they're taking her away.
[01:44:03.695 --> 01:44:07.157]  I mean, it's great optics to have that happen to you if you're protesting.
[01:44:07.197 --> 01:44:11.399]  I mean, like, for, hey, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:44:12.299 --> 01:44:12.960]  Like, ultimately.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:14.580]  Put these people through it.
[01:44:15.481 --> 01:44:18.402]  Yeah, I'm sure that woman was breaking the law.
[01:44:18.942 --> 01:44:19.763]  Like, don't get me wrong.
[01:44:20.908 --> 01:44:23.970]  No, I'm sure they're just hauling her away because they don't like people talking back.
[01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:27.953]  But these people aren't used to being hauled away by these people for political protests.
[01:44:28.013 --> 01:44:28.233]  Right.
[01:44:28.393 --> 01:44:30.674]  It's all unexpected for them.
[01:44:30.694 --> 01:44:31.555]  Yeah, it's all unexpected.
[01:44:31.595 --> 01:44:32.716]  They didn't think that this would happen.
[01:44:33.336 --> 01:44:34.617]  And God bless them.
[01:44:35.537 --> 01:44:36.118]  Seriously.
[01:44:36.418 --> 01:44:38.559]  Because what's going on in Palestine is wrong, in my opinion.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.641]  Back to Bill, please.
[01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:43.983]  In New York and Arkansas and other places.
[01:44:48.459 --> 01:44:50.965]  I urge you to talk to all your neighbors.
[01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:53.112]  That's a good point.
[01:45:23.456 --> 01:45:24.937]  See, they've got the text joined to 30330.
[01:45:25.417 --> 01:45:28.079]  I don't even know if the RNC did that.
[01:45:28.099 --> 01:45:29.440]  Did the RNC have pop-ups like that?
[01:45:29.961 --> 01:45:31.722]  No, but you just gave them a free plug.
[01:45:31.982 --> 01:45:32.863]  Oh my gosh.
[01:45:33.143 --> 01:45:33.644]  They tricked me.
[01:45:34.024 --> 01:45:35.405]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:45:35.445 --> 01:45:36.065]  That's right.
[01:45:36.826 --> 01:45:44.692]  But there's still a lot of slips between today and election day that we have to navigate.
[01:45:47.182 --> 01:45:47.662]  Extremely.
[01:45:47.682 --> 01:45:49.383]  Nah, I'm starting to feel quite retarded.
[01:46:07.014 --> 01:46:08.355]  It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?
[01:46:08.375 --> 01:46:11.497]  Yeah, I'm like, I'm medically... My IQ's starting to drop.
[01:46:11.517 --> 01:46:14.798]  I don't know if I can... It's the fluoride in the water.
[01:46:16.459 --> 01:46:18.580]  Apparently it's double the recommended levels.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.861]  There's a new report I saw today.
[01:46:21.142 --> 01:46:23.683]  Even worse than lead is the fluoride.
[01:46:24.924 --> 01:46:30.827]  My wife bought my kids, my little girls, they're three and one years old, toothpaste that had fluoride in it, and I snapped.
[01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:33.728]  Like, do you realize how bad this is for little kids?
[01:46:33.768 --> 01:46:34.910]  Oh, sorry, I didn't notice.
[01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:35.951]  Stay away from that stuff.
[01:46:46.556 --> 01:46:47.697]  Your grandchildren will be proud.
[01:46:47.737 --> 01:46:49.918]  Yeah, this is what your grandchildren are going to be proud of.
[01:46:50.538 --> 01:46:51.279]  What was that?
[01:46:51.379 --> 01:46:52.420]  Some lizard man?
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:59.784]  That looked like Westboro Baptist Church and then like an alien guy kind of like dancing on it.
[01:46:59.884 --> 01:47:01.545]  That's great.
[01:47:01.745 --> 01:47:03.566]  What did the sign say?
[01:47:03.606 --> 01:47:04.607]  Homosex is what?
[01:47:04.667 --> 01:47:06.988]  Did you roll it to the beginning again?
[01:47:07.008 --> 01:47:10.910]  I like seeing a group of crazy people and then another group of crazy people.
[01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:11.811]  Homosex is sin.
[01:47:12.471 --> 01:47:14.272]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:14.292 --> 01:47:15.133]  Homosex is sin.
[01:47:18.197 --> 01:47:18.617]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:18.677 --> 01:47:20.318]  They were getting, like, furry danced on.
[01:47:20.358 --> 01:47:21.198]  They got served.
[01:47:21.658 --> 01:47:23.079]  They got served, like, South Park.
[01:47:23.299 --> 01:47:26.180]  Now they have to come back with the dance battle from the Westboro Baptist Church.
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.620]  That is the Westboro Baptist Church.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:28.101]  Yeah, it is.
[01:47:28.601 --> 01:47:29.821]  Why are they dressed like that?
[01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:30.321]  I don't know.
[01:47:30.501 --> 01:47:30.821]  Tension.
[01:47:30.922 --> 01:47:34.323]  Because people like us show it three times in a row to millions of people.
[01:47:34.343 --> 01:47:38.244]  Because it's clippable.
[01:47:38.344 --> 01:47:38.924]  It's clippable.
[01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:43.877]  Alright, there he goes with his salute.
[01:47:44.397 --> 01:47:47.180]  Alright, so we found the clip that Rex was actually talking about.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:47.660]  We had it.
[01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.603]  Of Alex Jones on September 4th of 2013.
[01:47:50.663 --> 01:47:52.485]  There's Satan incarnate.
[01:47:52.765 --> 01:47:55.488]  There's all sorts of Satan incarnates right now on the table.
[01:47:55.508 --> 01:47:59.312]  Let's run the clip from 2013 of Alex Jones talking about Skull & Bones with these people.
[01:48:00.033 --> 01:48:01.995]  Do you know what goes on at Skull & Bones?
[01:48:03.456 --> 01:48:05.417]  Well I have a family audience so I can't say.
[01:48:05.697 --> 01:48:10.798]  They have sexual rituals where they believe they are possessed by entities.
[01:48:11.438 --> 01:48:12.579]  Basically space aliens.
[01:48:13.559 --> 01:48:21.641]  These are people that had gay sex hundreds of times in coffins.
[01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:22.442]  It's the truth to 11.
[01:48:23.242 --> 01:48:25.523]  Begging for spiritual entities to possess them.
[01:48:25.943 --> 01:48:32.525]  Hollywood should want to hire him to play the next Silence of the Lambs because there's no actor that can look this whacked out crazy.
[01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:39.053]  John Kerry, ladies and gentlemen, is a member of a satanic death cult.
[01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:43.056]  They believe entities possess them in pits of feces.
[01:48:44.116 --> 01:48:53.322]  I mean, we have a Secretary of State who has asked entities to enter his body while having sex in large vats of feces with men peeing on them.
[01:48:53.382 --> 01:48:59.567]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about... Is that the clip you were talking about?
[01:48:59.827 --> 01:49:00.087]  Yes.
[01:49:01.888 --> 01:49:02.589]  Very nice.
[01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.330]  Very good find by Crew and Chase.
[01:49:05.095 --> 01:49:05.916]  Oh man, unbelievable.
[01:49:05.936 --> 01:49:15.940]  So what I do, a lot of people don't realize you can do this, but if you go to archive.org and you type in the Alex Jones Show May 2014, June 2014.
[01:49:18.742 --> 01:49:25.625]  No, somebody has gone and created an archive going back to 2014 of every Alex Jones Show every month and every day.
[01:49:25.885 --> 01:49:26.125]  Yeah.
[01:49:26.205 --> 01:49:26.806]  Up until present.
[01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:28.786]  So it's 10 years of video accurate.
[01:49:29.247 --> 01:49:31.628]  And so what I'll do if I'm having a hard time falling asleep at night,
[01:49:32.577 --> 01:49:34.037]  Is I'll listen to the next day.
[01:49:34.538 --> 01:49:36.098]  So, what's today, the 21st?
[01:49:36.498 --> 01:49:44.160]  I would go to sleep tonight listening to the Alex Jones Show from August 22nd of 2014.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.540]  We gotta interrupt, I'm so sorry.
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:46.200]  Here's Nancy.
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.681]  We got the Crypt Keeper, the Queen Gremlin.
[01:49:49.001 --> 01:49:49.821]  We got her live.
[01:49:50.622 --> 01:49:51.382]  Isn't she beautiful?
[01:49:52.662 --> 01:49:55.723]  Isn't she lovely?
[01:49:55.743 --> 01:49:58.944]  Is she gonna wiggle her jaw?
[01:49:59.004 --> 01:50:00.224]  That's a side effect of embryomy.
[01:50:01.767 --> 01:50:01.907]  Yay.
[01:50:02.007 --> 01:50:03.249]  Destiny does it too.
[01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.651]  The omniliberal.
[01:50:06.654 --> 01:50:13.724]  Emperor, Palpatine, or Empress.
[01:50:15.026 --> 01:50:15.186]  Oh.
[01:50:15.226 --> 01:50:15.787]  What a beautiful omen.
[01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:29.856]  On January 20th, 2021, with the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we established one of the most successful presidencies of modern times.
[01:50:29.916 --> 01:50:31.436]  And we quickly proved that Democrats deliver.
[01:50:39.693 --> 01:51:03.751]  Millions of jobs, stronger infrastructure and rural broadband, a Biden child tax credit, rescuing human pensions, honoring our veterans, bold climate action, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, all thanks to President Biden's patriotic vision of a fairer America.
[01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:08.055]  Doing so with liberty and justice for all.
[01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:09.516]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:51:19.547 --> 01:51:26.355]  And I know that Vice President Harris is ready to take us to new heights.
[01:51:30.126 --> 01:51:33.028]  I've known Kamala Harris for decades.
[01:51:33.809 --> 01:51:41.495]  Personally, I know her a person of deep faith, which is reflected in her community care and service.
[01:51:42.355 --> 01:51:52.043]  Officially, she is a leader of strength and wisdom and eloquence on policy, most recently demonstrated fighting for one's right to choose.
[01:51:56.027 --> 01:52:09.234]  Politically, she is astute and strategic in winning difficult elections, quickly securing the nomination with dignity and grace, and choosing Tim Walz as our Vice President.
[01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:18.578]  I had the honor of serving with Tim for 12 years in the Congress.
[01:52:19.319 --> 01:52:25.502]  He united Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to turn a red district blue.
[01:52:28.564 --> 01:52:39.532]  He showed courage when he came to Congress in voting for the Affordable Care Act, meeting the needs of his constituents, despite Republicans' lies and misrepresentation.
[01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:52.522]  When he went home, won the election, he returned to Congress, he fought for our Americans' heroes as the Democratic leader of the Veterans Affairs Committee.
[01:52:53.303 --> 01:52:53.923]  Thank you, Tim.
[01:53:00.322 --> 01:53:03.843]  January 6th was a perilous moment for our democracy.
[01:53:04.503 --> 01:53:18.406]  Never before had a President of the United States so brazenly assaulted the bedrock of our democracy, so gleefully embraced political violence, so willfully betrayed his oath of office.
[01:53:19.506 --> 01:53:23.867]  Let us not forget who assaulted democracy on January 6th.
[01:53:25.047 --> 01:53:25.587]  He did!
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.541]  But let us not forget who saved democracy that day.
[01:53:33.281 --> 01:53:33.942]  We did.
[01:53:38.863 --> 01:53:43.925]  And thank God we had a Democratic House of Representatives then.
[01:53:47.608 --> 01:53:50.631]  We returned to the Capitol that very same night.
[01:53:51.272 --> 01:53:56.357]  We insisted on certifying the election results on the floors of the House and the Senate.
[01:53:56.957 --> 01:54:02.943]  And we demonstrated to America and to the world that American democracy prevailed.
[01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:10.871]  The parable of January 6th
[01:54:12.321 --> 01:54:19.926]  Reminds us that our democracy is only as strong as the courage and commitment of those entrusted with its care.
[01:54:20.847 --> 01:54:29.652]  And we must choose leaders who believe in free and fair elections, who respect the peaceful transfer of power.
[01:54:31.954 --> 01:54:35.416]  The choice couldn't be clearer.
[01:54:35.476 --> 01:54:39.639]  Those leaders are Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.
[01:54:41.528 --> 01:54:43.871]  From the party that just tried to assassinate President Trump.
[01:54:44.011 --> 01:54:49.998]  Well, I like the Jimmy Dore talking point of, why didn't all the gun nuts bring their guns to the revolution?
[01:54:50.118 --> 01:54:50.959]  Where were all the guns?
[01:54:51.319 --> 01:54:52.020]  At the... J6?
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:52.841]  Yeah, at the J6.
[01:54:52.941 --> 01:54:54.963]  Yeah, it obviously wasn't an insurrection if it was an army.
[01:54:55.003 --> 01:54:55.804]  It's just a crazy riot.
[01:54:55.844 --> 01:54:59.649]  You don't leave your guns at home if you're gonna conduct an insurrection, right?
[01:55:02.489 --> 01:55:05.872]  Really well on that debate with Destiny.
[01:55:05.953 --> 01:55:06.713]  Yeah.
[01:55:06.873 --> 01:55:07.794]  Was Alex on that one?
[01:55:07.914 --> 01:55:11.878]  Yeah, it was here and it was Glenn Greenwald and Darren Beattie and the Krasenstein clones.
[01:55:11.918 --> 01:55:12.519]  Yeah.
[01:55:12.779 --> 01:55:13.940]  Glenn Greenwald is amazing.
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:14.761]  Yeah, brilliant man.
[01:55:15.021 --> 01:55:18.565]  But I will say, I care very little about Brazilian news.
[01:55:22.206 --> 01:55:43.711]  Yes, but at the same time, you know, it's important because it's a shadow of what will happen everywhere, you know, now Venezuela and X. Now we have, I just found out today that the e-safety commissioner who's trying to, you know, silence people in different countries, the e-safety commissioner of Australia actually has the power to switch off the internet in Australia.
[01:55:44.031 --> 01:55:46.532]  Well, Obama has the internet kill switch, too, here in the United States.
[01:55:46.632 --> 01:55:46.792]  Right.
[01:55:47.032 --> 01:55:47.352]  Okay.
[01:55:47.712 --> 01:55:47.852]  Good.
[01:55:47.872 --> 01:55:48.993]  That was a big thing he did, right?
[01:55:49.073 --> 01:55:49.553]  It's time.
[01:55:49.793 --> 01:55:52.454]  The government must be able to, you know, just nuke the internet.
[01:55:52.494 --> 01:55:53.054]  It's good.
[01:55:53.214 --> 01:55:54.354]  Why do you have a problem with it, Chase?
[01:55:54.374 --> 01:55:55.335]  Is there something wrong with you?
[01:55:55.355 --> 01:55:57.035]  Did you vote for Biden?
[01:55:57.055 --> 01:55:57.635]  What's wrong with you?
[01:55:57.655 --> 01:55:59.356]  You vote for Donald Blumpf?
[01:56:01.792 --> 01:56:02.612]  Republican scum?
[01:56:02.632 --> 01:56:04.674]  That's what they call them.
[01:56:04.714 --> 01:56:07.776]  The left can't meme, so they call them Trump and Blump.
[01:56:07.816 --> 01:56:08.857]  Vaughn Craps and Pants.
[01:56:08.877 --> 01:56:09.857]  Yeah, Vaughn Craps and Pants.
[01:56:09.897 --> 01:56:10.758]  It doesn't even make sense.
[01:56:11.238 --> 01:56:12.199]  Is she walking off already?
[01:56:12.219 --> 01:56:12.699]  That was it?
[01:56:12.719 --> 01:56:14.741]  Man, that was lackluster.
[01:56:14.781 --> 01:56:16.081]  Botox time.
[01:56:16.462 --> 01:56:18.063]  Botox time.
[01:56:18.223 --> 01:56:24.687]  So, it's supposed to be Josh Shapiro next, but it looks like they have a little leftist medley before.
[01:56:25.108 --> 01:56:25.828]  Oh, let's say this.
[01:56:25.968 --> 01:56:26.929]  Okay, let's expand.
[01:56:26.969 --> 01:56:27.749]  Is this going to be a song?
[01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:29.931]  Is that John Legend?
[01:56:31.772 --> 01:56:32.773]  I'm already uncomfortable.
[01:56:33.253 --> 01:56:35.995]  Kamala Harris is our auntie.
[01:56:37.797 --> 01:56:37.917]  Oh!
[01:56:38.938 --> 01:56:39.959]  Auntie?
[01:56:40.419 --> 01:56:41.040]  Auntie?
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:42.241]  Auntie?
[01:56:42.461 --> 01:56:43.301]  That's so gross.
[01:56:44.042 --> 01:56:44.983]  She'll lift us up.
[01:56:45.283 --> 01:56:49.667]  No, I think it's... In 2016... Obviously Kamala Harris is that guy's aunt.
[01:56:49.707 --> 01:56:51.228]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:56:52.889 --> 01:56:57.393]  I was only nine, but I knew enough to be concerned.
[01:56:58.194 --> 01:56:58.474]  Really?
[01:56:58.494 --> 01:56:59.435]  Auntie said,
[01:57:00.233 --> 01:57:01.213]  Yeah, I thought I was smart.
[01:57:01.233 --> 01:57:02.234]  They're calling her auntie?
[01:57:02.254 --> 01:57:06.396]  They're calling her auntie, yes.
[01:57:08.656 --> 01:57:11.938]  Yeah, you were too young to remember, but we had money back then.
[01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:12.958]  Low tax.
[01:57:13.899 --> 01:57:14.219]  Oil.
[01:57:14.739 --> 01:57:17.880]  Yeah, my cousin bought a boat.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.302]  Keep saying it, dude.
[01:57:21.482 --> 01:57:23.723]  They're trying to bring auntie into this.
[01:57:23.763 --> 01:57:25.203]  Dude, this is gross.
[01:57:27.944 --> 01:57:31.626]  Auntie taught me about being present when I was born.
[01:57:31.666 --> 01:57:34.348]  So this is true cult struggle session.
[01:57:34.648 --> 01:57:36.249]  Auntie taught me how to alienate.
[01:57:36.269 --> 01:57:40.812]  She's definitely not a mom, but she could be an aunt.
[01:57:40.832 --> 01:57:42.933]  And by the way, everybody in the Midwest says aunt.
[01:57:43.053 --> 01:57:45.434]  They don't say aunt like I have an Aunt Denise.
[01:57:45.474 --> 01:57:46.435]  You gotta watch this, man.
[01:57:46.475 --> 01:57:47.476]  This is too important.
[01:57:47.716 --> 01:57:50.437]  So saying auntie alienates half the country, the swing states.
[01:57:50.477 --> 01:57:52.919]  No matter their age or their background.
[01:57:52.939 --> 01:57:53.659]  This is real bad.
[01:57:54.039 --> 01:57:55.901]  Auntie, we love you.
[01:57:55.961 --> 01:57:56.501]  That's five.
[01:57:56.801 --> 01:57:58.382]  We're so proud of you.
[01:57:58.422 --> 01:58:00.063]  Say joy, say joy, say joy.
[01:58:00.183 --> 01:58:02.844]  And most importantly, you're a baller.
[01:58:02.864 --> 01:58:05.546]  She is a baller!
[01:58:05.566 --> 01:58:07.267]  She is though, dude!
[01:58:07.327 --> 01:58:13.990]  What was that garbage we just witnessed?
[01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:15.911]  Alright, where are their teleprompters?
[01:58:16.151 --> 01:58:17.052]  Where are the teleprompters?
[01:58:17.372 --> 01:58:18.633]  They memorized and rehearsed that.
[01:58:19.588 --> 01:58:22.711]  Those guys are trying to get with that gal, too, and she's not having it.
[01:58:22.811 --> 01:58:25.893]  This is true dictatorship, end-of-the-world stuff that we're seeing.
[01:58:25.933 --> 01:58:26.854]  This is horrifying.
[01:58:26.914 --> 01:58:28.375]  I'm getting chills just watching it.
[01:58:28.675 --> 01:58:36.461]  They just had their groomed, manicured, like, junior and high school types come out and go, I love Auntie Kamala.
[01:58:36.521 --> 01:58:45.008]  Maria Z, how many times have you seen this exact pink suit that this woman is wearing throughout the last three days?
[01:58:45.328 --> 01:58:48.811]  I think I've seen the exact same suit a half a dozen times.
[01:58:49.551 --> 01:58:53.294]  Look, I haven't done like half a dozen people worn that suit.
[01:58:54.475 --> 01:58:59.299]  Well, it's kind of like the Star Trek, but like kind of lame and evil vibe that they go for.
[01:58:59.479 --> 01:58:59.699]  Right.
[01:58:59.819 --> 01:59:02.922]  They kind of they want to look like space people because they think it makes them look smart.
[01:59:03.202 --> 01:59:03.362]  Right.
[01:59:03.382 --> 01:59:06.525]  But in reality, it just makes them look like they wouldn't survive outside the pod.
[01:59:06.965 --> 01:59:08.687]  You know, I mean,
[01:59:09.366 --> 01:59:18.934]  Well, I mean, under the Biden administration, people can't afford their groceries, so it would make sense if people have to recycle suits to be here.
[01:59:19.134 --> 01:59:21.656]  Do you think they have a costume closet in the back?
[01:59:21.776 --> 01:59:22.156]  Probably.
[01:59:22.176 --> 01:59:23.938]  Are you going for the Mao look, Hillary?
[01:59:24.078 --> 01:59:28.481]  It seemed to work for you okay in 2016 as far as the primary is concerned, but it didn't get you through the general.
[01:59:28.501 --> 01:59:31.724]  Remember, she would wear the Mao suit.
[01:59:31.744 --> 01:59:34.907]  Have you seen that clip of Jacinda Ardern at the United Nations?
[01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:37.089]  The former PM of New Zealand.
[01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:39.110]  Yes, that was from like the day before yesterday or yesterday.
[01:59:39.330 --> 01:59:45.294]  No, no, this is a little while back and she she she's declaring war on all of the people.
[01:59:45.314 --> 01:59:45.394]  Yeah.
[01:59:46.615 --> 01:59:49.236]  Of the countries that disagree with the government.
[01:59:49.456 --> 01:59:49.616]  Yes.
[01:59:49.676 --> 01:59:51.518]  And they all stand up and give her a standing ovation.
[01:59:51.578 --> 01:59:57.681]  Anyway, around that time, she started to wear real class Schwab, evil Darth Vader type outfits all the time.
[01:59:57.721 --> 01:59:58.562]  Like big shoulders.
[01:59:58.602 --> 01:59:59.762]  Yeah, just this cube.
[02:00:00.163 --> 02:00:01.263]  Very like geometric.
[02:00:01.283 --> 02:00:02.224]  Yes, yes.
[02:00:02.364 --> 02:00:02.924]  Wow.
[02:00:03.145 --> 02:00:04.565]  Like Lady Gaga playing the Super Bowl.
[02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:10.733]  Actually, you know what, I think that clip might be in the Sunday Show folder, guys, of Jacinda.
[02:00:10.873 --> 02:00:13.375]  It did resurface recently, though the clip is very old.
[02:00:13.395 --> 02:00:14.797]  I saw it resurface very recently.
[02:00:14.817 --> 02:00:16.078]  If you guys can find it, that'd be awesome.
[02:00:16.878 --> 02:00:17.919]  Let's listen to what she's saying.
[02:00:17.939 --> 02:00:28.969]  I saw scores of mothers who lost their babies to gun violence lining up day after day at
[02:00:31.735 --> 02:00:33.636]  Somebody actually choreographed this.
[02:00:34.277 --> 02:00:36.538]  She's got some modern dance moves going on.
[02:00:36.738 --> 02:00:38.819]  I'm getting, like, withdrawals from watching this.
[02:00:38.839 --> 02:00:39.920]  This is making me sick.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.921]  I actually kind of want to vote for Kamala now.
[02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:47.805]  Do you think anybody watched the DNC?
[02:00:47.825 --> 02:00:48.986]  Like, that was on the fence?
[02:00:49.346 --> 02:00:50.607]  You know, and it's like, you know what?
[02:00:50.667 --> 02:00:51.647]  That was pretty good.
[02:00:51.968 --> 02:00:55.590]  I think I'm gonna vote for Kamala.
[02:00:55.610 --> 02:00:56.490]  What about the RNC, though?
[02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:58.912]  Do you think some people were like, eh, and they watched the RNC, and they're like, okay.
[02:00:59.531 --> 02:01:01.192]  Okay, this person is not important.
[02:01:01.232 --> 02:01:02.272]  Front facing camera now.
[02:01:04.213 --> 02:01:04.914]  Front facing camera.
[02:01:05.154 --> 02:01:06.174]  This is why we need Rex here.
[02:01:06.214 --> 02:01:07.615]  He's got the Alex Jones mentality.
[02:01:07.655 --> 02:01:08.895]  He knows how to produce.
[02:01:08.975 --> 02:01:11.477]  Please, please minimize this woman.
[02:01:12.497 --> 02:01:15.038]  I didn't, I didn't find the RNC overly compelling.
[02:01:15.298 --> 02:01:15.779]  I didn't either.
[02:01:15.819 --> 02:01:21.341]  I thought it was very Boomer, Yacht Rock, kind of like, you know, lame retirement party vibe.
[02:01:21.541 --> 02:01:21.801]  Yep.
[02:01:22.021 --> 02:01:25.243]  But it was now relative to this much better.
[02:01:28.028 --> 02:01:28.909]  They all suck.
[02:01:29.009 --> 02:01:30.310]  They're all old.
[02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:33.472]  The two-party system has got to end at some point.
[02:01:34.172 --> 02:01:36.414]  I like the Republican populist resurgence.
[02:01:36.494 --> 02:01:37.715]  I find it to be interesting.
[02:01:37.775 --> 02:01:38.515]  I think it's cool.
[02:01:38.575 --> 02:01:40.036]  I think it's what we need in our time.
[02:01:40.577 --> 02:01:43.999]  But 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the line, we need something else.
[02:01:44.039 --> 02:01:44.840]  This ain't working out.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.361]  All the stars are like 89 years old.
[02:01:47.722 --> 02:01:52.305]  This would be like, we got Muhammad Ali and he's still alive, but he's got Parkinson's.
[02:01:52.665 --> 02:01:52.886]  Yeah.
[02:01:53.126 --> 02:01:54.188]  And we're gonna make him box.
[02:01:54.228 --> 02:01:56.132]  That's what we're making all these people do, including Trump.
[02:01:56.172 --> 02:01:57.093]  Trump doesn't want to run.
[02:01:57.133 --> 02:01:57.694]  He has to.
[02:01:57.714 --> 02:01:59.237]  At the end of the day, right?
[02:01:59.638 --> 02:01:59.798]  Yep.
[02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:18.320]  So I mean, this person's not important, this person's just telling us about, you know, hundreds of deaths in Chicago over the weekend, we gotta take your AR-15 away, when in reality, these are people buying illegal weapons that have felonies, that are obtaining these guns through illicit means, and no legislation they'll ever pass will stop it.
[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:21.662]  All it will ever do is take guns away from law-abiding citizens.
[02:02:23.163 --> 02:02:37.265]  I'm just in love with the CDC Commission study that Barack Obama made them do, where they analyzed gun deaths, and it was something like 37,000 annually, but 250,000 to 3 million defensive uses of a firearm per year.
[02:02:37.705 --> 02:02:41.926]  So these are things these people don't talk about, because they don't care, and because they're stupid.
[02:02:42.626 --> 02:02:43.106]  That's my opinion.
[02:02:43.766 --> 02:02:44.467]  Well, you're right, Rex.
[02:02:44.507 --> 02:02:46.947]  They don't actually give people the facts.
[02:02:47.407 --> 02:02:51.928]  They push an agenda with skewed statistics, if they even bother to give any.
[02:02:52.847 --> 02:02:57.329]  This is, this is the, the, I mean, every political party does this to some degree.
[02:02:57.529 --> 02:03:03.891]  You know, this is kind of the game of politics, but the Democrats are particularly guilty of this.
[02:03:03.991 --> 02:03:04.951]  Liberals in general.
[02:03:04.971 --> 02:03:07.412]  I just can't believe they called her auntie.
[02:03:07.572 --> 02:03:08.672]  Yeah, I was thinking about that.
[02:03:08.692 --> 02:03:09.233]  That was creepy.
[02:03:09.273 --> 02:03:11.373]  Overhead cam, please, on my phone.
[02:03:11.993 --> 02:03:13.514]  I just had Grok make this image.
[02:03:13.894 --> 02:03:15.455]  I'm voting for auntie Donald Trump.
[02:03:17.555 --> 02:03:20.376]  I want the audience to see this overhead cam, or you can pull it up on my Twitter.
[02:03:20.416 --> 02:03:22.437]  It's the most recent tweet, either one, whichever looks better.
[02:03:24.255 --> 02:03:24.795]  Who's this guy?
[02:03:24.815 --> 02:03:25.676]  I don't recognize him either.
[02:03:25.696 --> 02:03:28.938]  I think this is governor or mayor of New York.
[02:03:29.699 --> 02:03:30.179]  Not governor.
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:31.280]  Yeah.
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:32.861]  I'm voting for Auntie Donald.
[02:03:33.401 --> 02:03:33.942]  That's pretty good.
[02:03:37.644 --> 02:03:38.004]  Who says?
[02:03:38.124 --> 02:03:39.045]  Did you grow up in Texas?
[02:03:39.085 --> 02:03:40.866]  Do you call it your aunt or your auntie?
[02:03:41.327 --> 02:03:41.647]  Aunt.
[02:03:42.027 --> 02:03:42.707]  Yeah.
[02:03:43.068 --> 02:03:44.649]  So if you're trying to get the swing state vote.
[02:03:45.725 --> 02:03:47.747]  You don't say auntie, because it alienates.
[02:03:47.807 --> 02:03:49.828]  I remember, it like bothered me.
[02:03:49.888 --> 02:03:54.832]  We're Texan, so we're not really Southern guys, although we are Southern by definition.
[02:03:54.973 --> 02:03:56.254]  I think it may be a little different.
[02:03:56.294 --> 02:03:57.995]  I don't know, but I always said aunt.
[02:03:58.275 --> 02:04:02.879]  Yeah, but in the South, it's like East Coast, New York, they say auntie.
[02:04:03.339 --> 02:04:04.260]  In Maine, they say auntie.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.283]  In California, I think some of them say auntie, but it's aunt.
[02:04:07.683 --> 02:04:09.845]  Maybe they're trying to relate to the Californians.
[02:04:10.185 --> 02:04:10.345]  I guess.
[02:04:10.405 --> 02:04:11.826]  As well as accent changes.
[02:04:12.467 --> 02:04:13.228]  It's a black thing?
[02:04:14.489 --> 02:04:14.789]  Auntie.
[02:04:16.694 --> 02:04:16.834]  Oh.
[02:04:18.396 --> 02:04:21.498]  Who's the lady that they took off of the syrup bottle?
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:23.921]  Aunt Jemima.
[02:04:24.081 --> 02:04:25.662]  Aunt Jemima, not Auntie Jemima.
[02:04:26.403 --> 02:04:28.464]  It's not Auntie Jemima, it's Aunt Jemima, right?
[02:04:29.185 --> 02:04:29.705]  It is Auntie?
[02:04:30.666 --> 02:04:32.488]  So this is about pretending Kamala's black?
[02:04:33.008 --> 02:04:33.969]  Maybe that's what it was about.
[02:04:33.989 --> 02:04:34.469]  Right.
[02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:40.795]  You pick walls because you want to win the swing state votes, but then you use the word auntie, it's because she's black.
[02:04:41.561 --> 02:04:44.945]  There's actually that clip that you played of Don Lamond earlier.
[02:04:44.985 --> 02:04:45.185]  Yeah.
[02:04:45.425 --> 02:04:51.492]  The first lady that he spoke to, she said, it seems like every time they need our support, they just bring a black person out.
[02:04:51.872 --> 02:04:52.293]  Yeah.
[02:04:52.313 --> 02:04:53.014]  This is what she said.
[02:04:53.094 --> 02:04:53.855]  She was a black lady.
[02:04:54.505 --> 02:04:54.845]  It's true.
[02:04:54.865 --> 02:04:55.506]  She was offended by this.
[02:04:55.526 --> 02:04:56.327]  It's very token.
[02:04:56.367 --> 02:04:57.708]  It comes off very token black.
[02:04:57.788 --> 02:05:01.072]  It's very token to have Megan Thee Stallion coming and twerking.
[02:05:01.112 --> 02:05:05.036]  I loved Candace Owens' commentary on this when she was like, you know, so what?
[02:05:05.056 --> 02:05:06.878]  All black people, we just love to twerk?
[02:05:06.898 --> 02:05:08.259]  This is so offensive.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:09.621]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:05:09.761 --> 02:05:10.381]  I heard a story.
[02:05:10.421 --> 02:05:11.503]  I'm not sure if it's true or not.
[02:05:11.543 --> 02:05:12.644]  I was listening to a
[02:05:13.104 --> 02:05:18.065]  Kind of popular, uh, I guess you'd call him, like, black influencer on, uh, Say Cheese TV.
[02:05:18.566 --> 02:05:26.648]  And he was saying, Donald Trump went out and to some sort of city and said, I want to meet with black influencers, but only if they have some kind of jewelry on.
[02:05:27.688 --> 02:05:37.071]  I view that, and he viewed that, and it's not really my place to view it, but he viewed that as less offensive, or at least equivalent to Kamala Harris bringing out Megan Thee Stallion and having him twerk.
[02:05:37.331 --> 02:05:37.591]  Yeah.
[02:05:37.911 --> 02:05:41.672]  I don't like, like, and, and they, they say that we're the bad people.
[02:05:42.895 --> 02:05:48.858]  We gotta find that clip of Hillary Clinton talking about, I'll read this in a second, keep it up please.
[02:05:49.338 --> 02:05:51.319]  Hillary Clinton talking about how she's not Tammy Wynette.
[02:05:51.339 --> 02:05:55.241]  Because the left does this in other ways, the same mechanism through different mediums, they say.
[02:05:56.362 --> 02:05:58.623]  They change their accent depending on which audience they're talking to.
[02:05:58.663 --> 02:06:00.904]  Hillary Clinton's famous for going around and changing her accent.
[02:06:00.944 --> 02:06:06.347]  Now we've seen that Kamala Harris has done this where sometimes she tries to sound ghetto and she fails at it because it's not natural for her to sound that way.
[02:06:07.150 --> 02:06:11.953]  But it's just crazy how indicative of the hypocrisy that is.
[02:06:11.973 --> 02:06:13.274]  Can you throw that definition back up though?
[02:06:13.294 --> 02:06:14.234]  I do want to read it out loud.
[02:06:14.855 --> 02:06:23.240]  The term auntie can be a respectful term for an elder in some black American cultures, such as those in Africa and in the Caribbean, as well as in Asian cultures.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:30.367]  However, some black American women have spoken out about feeling that the term has an implicit ageism and can feel like a red flag.
[02:06:30.847 --> 02:06:39.296]  Many feel that being called auntie suggests they are older than others and that they must perform some kind of caretaking or advisory service for younger people.
[02:06:39.696 --> 02:06:41.878]  Kamala's niece is a bottle of wine.
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.143]  Yeah, so you might refer to, so if you had like a black nanny in the 50s, right?
[02:06:47.203 --> 02:06:49.245]  You might refer to that as Auntie so-and-so.
[02:06:49.525 --> 02:06:51.587]  Like Aunt Jemima or Auntie Jemima.
[02:06:51.647 --> 02:06:52.188]  That makes sense.
[02:06:52.708 --> 02:06:53.309]  It is a black thing.
[02:06:53.329 --> 02:06:54.310]  They're trying to black a fire.
[02:06:56.031 --> 02:06:56.272]  Wow.
[02:06:56.652 --> 02:06:56.792]  Ugh.
[02:06:57.313 --> 02:06:58.153]  What a sellout.
[02:06:58.273 --> 02:06:59.274]  Charlemagne the God.
[02:06:59.575 --> 02:07:00.275]  What a sellout.
[02:07:02.517 --> 02:07:03.398]  Alright, alright.
[02:07:03.438 --> 02:07:04.619]  Let's start this clip from the beginning.
[02:07:04.659 --> 02:07:06.041]  Hillary Clinton saying she has hot stuff in her bag.
[02:07:06.061 --> 02:07:06.701]  Look at that great white cow.
[02:07:06.721 --> 02:07:07.402]  Does she prove it?
[02:07:09.474 --> 02:07:10.095]  No more questions?
[02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:11.256]  They said no, she has to go.
[02:07:11.556 --> 02:07:13.157]  What's something that you always carry with you?
[02:07:13.417 --> 02:07:13.918]  Hot sauce.
[02:07:15.359 --> 02:07:15.899]  Really?
[02:07:15.919 --> 02:07:16.200]  Yeah.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:16.700]  Yeah.
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:17.361]  Really?
[02:07:17.401 --> 02:07:18.982]  Are you getting in formation right now?
[02:07:19.022 --> 02:07:19.683]  Hot sauce.
[02:07:19.743 --> 02:07:22.225]  Hot sauce in my bag.
[02:07:22.265 --> 02:07:23.666]  Lathering an omelet with Tabasco sauce.
[02:07:23.686 --> 02:07:24.066]  Hot sauce.
[02:07:24.327 --> 02:07:24.707]  Really?
[02:07:24.787 --> 02:07:25.387]  Yes.
[02:07:25.447 --> 02:07:28.250]  Now listen, I just want you to know, people are going to see this and say, okay.
[02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:30.492]  Notice the fidgeting with her hands?
[02:07:30.592 --> 02:07:30.792]  Okay.
[02:07:30.812 --> 02:07:32.593]  Yeah, they're not doing that.
[02:07:32.694 --> 02:07:33.274]  Is it working?
[02:07:33.754 --> 02:07:34.875]  You're not lying.
[02:07:35.276 --> 02:07:36.477]  Okay, is it working?
[02:07:37.113 --> 02:07:37.633]  Wow.
[02:07:37.973 --> 02:07:38.754]  That is gross.
[02:07:38.794 --> 02:07:40.735]  But she doesn't carry hot sauce with her anywhere.
[02:07:40.755 --> 02:07:43.396]  Have you ever seen her with a purse?
[02:07:43.996 --> 02:07:45.757]  I just thought of a real nasty thing to say.
[02:07:45.777 --> 02:07:46.838]  I ain't gonna say it.
[02:07:46.878 --> 02:07:51.000]  I've never seen a picture of Big Mike pregnant and I've never seen Hillary Clinton carry a purse.
[02:07:51.527 --> 02:07:53.808]  Big Mike can't get pregnant.
[02:07:53.968 --> 02:07:54.888]  You must help Alex.
[02:07:54.968 --> 02:07:56.468]  Let's just say that.
[02:07:56.608 --> 02:07:58.269]  Let's make it abundantly clear.
[02:07:58.289 --> 02:08:00.029]  You believe that Big Mike is actually a man too?
[02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:02.710]  Because Alex Jones, I thought he was just joking and it was funny.
[02:08:03.090 --> 02:08:04.711]  He's like legit, that's a big dong.
[02:08:05.051 --> 02:08:05.791]  That's a dude.
[02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:06.711]  For real.
[02:08:06.991 --> 02:08:08.592]  That's a for real dude.
[02:08:08.632 --> 02:08:12.093]  But why would you select a Manchurian candidate who had such a big skeleton?
[02:08:12.913 --> 02:08:13.553]  No pun intended.
[02:08:13.633 --> 02:08:15.394]  When you could select one with such a big dick.
[02:08:21.206 --> 02:08:22.386]  Yeah, I don't feel no ways tired.
[02:08:22.406 --> 02:08:22.747]  Let's play this.
[02:08:22.767 --> 02:08:24.427]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[02:08:24.627 --> 02:08:25.848]  Yeah, Rex did it perfect.
[02:08:25.868 --> 02:08:26.888]  He can do Hillary and Bill.
[02:08:29.509 --> 02:08:30.729]  We have to stay awake.
[02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:34.051]  We have a march to finish.
[02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:44.514]  On this Lord's Day, let us say with one voice the words of James Cleveland's great freedom hymn.
[02:08:45.155 --> 02:08:45.615]  Oh God.
[02:08:46.395 --> 02:08:48.536]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:54.233]  This is peak cultural appropriation.
[02:08:54.253 --> 02:09:00.418]  She whips out a bottle of hot sauce and just sprays it all over the Bible.
[02:09:00.458 --> 02:09:01.039]  My gosh.
[02:09:12.007 --> 02:09:15.148]  Well, she likes to sprinkle her food with a little holy water so it burns.
[02:09:15.288 --> 02:09:16.629]  You know, there's a metaphor here.
[02:09:17.069 --> 02:09:20.791]  She has a binder with her speech in it, laid over the open Bible.
[02:09:20.811 --> 02:09:20.871]  Yep.
[02:09:21.431 --> 02:09:24.992]  You know, like, oh, what I have to say is more important than the Word of God.
[02:09:25.192 --> 02:09:28.254]  That's such a great take and such a good catch.
[02:09:28.294 --> 02:09:29.594]  That's awesome.
[02:09:29.614 --> 02:09:30.395]  That's awesome.
[02:09:30.675 --> 02:09:31.595]  Can we go back to that?
[02:09:31.895 --> 02:09:32.475]  That's great.
[02:09:32.495 --> 02:09:33.216]  Play it again.
[02:09:33.396 --> 02:09:33.896]  That's great.
[02:09:34.136 --> 02:09:34.737]  Roll it again, look.
[02:09:34.977 --> 02:09:37.479]  She's got the binder, it's laminated with her speech.
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:38.921]  Roll it, I can talk over it.
[02:09:39.301 --> 02:09:40.643]  And it's laid over the open Bible.
[02:09:40.663 --> 02:09:42.464]  So the Bible was open to a verse in this church service.
[02:09:42.484 --> 02:09:44.947]  They probably read from that verse right before she came up and spoke.
[02:09:45.367 --> 02:09:48.030]  And she, instead of closing the Bible and putting it off to the side, she just lays it over.
[02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:51.533]  And it looks like, it looks like she's literally on the gospel.
[02:09:51.694 --> 02:09:52.955]  It looks like she's on the New Testament.
[02:09:52.975 --> 02:09:55.017]  Yeah, it's definitely early New Testament right there.
[02:09:55.037 --> 02:09:55.738]  It's probably Mark.
[02:09:55.918 --> 02:09:56.639]  Yeah, she's on Mark.
[02:09:58.297 --> 02:10:00.079]  The symbolism and imagery, it's all there.
[02:10:00.119 --> 02:10:00.699]  I mean, obviously.
[02:10:00.819 --> 02:10:01.920]  She's dressed like Mao.
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:03.461]  She's culturally appropriating.
[02:10:03.481 --> 02:10:05.083]  Thick, black.
[02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:07.064]  It's a binder full of women.
[02:10:08.886 --> 02:10:11.108]  Those are her two tablets from Satan.
[02:10:12.389 --> 02:10:15.572]  I have these 15, 10 commandments.
[02:10:17.693 --> 02:10:18.074]  Wow.
[02:10:18.234 --> 02:10:18.995]  Unbelievable.
[02:10:19.175 --> 02:10:19.835]  Evil witch.
[02:10:20.236 --> 02:10:20.576]  Look at her.
[02:10:21.156 --> 02:10:21.417]  Yeah.
[02:10:22.017 --> 02:10:22.237]  Yeah.
[02:10:23.018 --> 02:10:26.041]  And how, how, when did it become obvious that she was evil?
[02:10:26.758 --> 02:10:27.719]  Was it always obvious?
[02:10:27.739 --> 02:10:28.659]  Did people always know?
[02:10:28.679 --> 02:10:32.121]  Like, even back early in the 90s, before the Monica stuff, early on, was it obvious?
[02:10:33.902 --> 02:10:34.522]  I wasn't alive.
[02:10:34.542 --> 02:10:36.823]  I wasn't alive.
[02:10:39.105 --> 02:10:41.946]  Clinton murders, that's so real, so neglected.
[02:10:42.586 --> 02:10:47.949]  There's like, what, like 78 people that have died mysteriously associated with the Clintons.
[02:10:48.029 --> 02:10:50.971]  At least a dozen of them are, like, very alarming.
[02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:55.492]  There's the chef that drowned and same thing happened to Obama's chef.
[02:10:55.833 --> 02:10:56.473]  Obama's, yes.
[02:10:56.493 --> 02:10:58.635]  Yeah, but Clinton, they had a chef that drowned as well.
[02:10:58.855 --> 02:11:00.436]  Also, it's like a common thing for them to do.
[02:11:00.496 --> 02:11:05.380]  Yeah, they must be hiring the same person to do the whacking because there's like a method that's preferred.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.862]  It's almost like a serial killer thing where it's like happening the same way.
[02:11:08.102 --> 02:11:09.523]  Then there was a guy that was hanging from a tree.
[02:11:09.583 --> 02:11:10.343]  Someone from a lodge.
[02:11:10.744 --> 02:11:15.267]  There was a guy hanging from a tree, right, who had shot himself in the torso before he hanged himself.
[02:11:15.447 --> 02:11:16.848]  Well, let's do a little thought experiment.
[02:11:16.888 --> 02:11:20.550]  We've all seen shows and dramas where rich people do crazy things.
[02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:24.713]  Do you not think that those same rich people watch those shows and go, huh, I want to do that?
[02:11:25.213 --> 02:11:28.035]  I think those same rich people make those shows.
[02:11:28.315 --> 02:11:28.875]  That's right.
[02:11:28.895 --> 02:11:29.536]  That's where I'm going.
[02:11:29.576 --> 02:11:30.396]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:11:30.496 --> 02:11:30.956]  That's where I'm going.
[02:11:30.976 --> 02:11:35.359]  The first thing that popped in my head is House of Cards when Frank Underwood, right?
[02:11:35.779 --> 02:11:36.240]  Or Underhill.
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:36.940]  Underwood.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.121]  Underhill's from Lord of the Rings.
[02:11:38.601 --> 02:11:41.383]  Frank Underwood shoves Chloe right in front of the train.
[02:11:42.335 --> 02:11:47.018]  And the subway, it's like, everybody just knows that these people are literally murderers.
[02:11:48.419 --> 02:11:48.919]  At the core.
[02:11:49.519 --> 02:11:50.560]  Who's this Lemming?
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:52.621]  Let's look at another pink pantsuit.
[02:11:53.422 --> 02:11:57.264]  Helped win billions for working families nationwide.
[02:11:58.264 --> 02:12:00.426]  Delivering for families?
[02:12:00.786 --> 02:12:01.787]  That's Kamala Harris.
[02:12:03.247 --> 02:12:07.150]  Kamala and I also work to protect our southern border.
[02:12:08.110 --> 02:12:08.851]  During that time,
[02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:14.534]  And they have, like, a few selected settings.
[02:12:14.634 --> 02:12:18.418]  Like, for example, Newt Gingrich's wife has the exact same haircut.
[02:12:18.578 --> 02:12:19.979]  They look like they were made in the same factory.
[02:12:30.802 --> 02:12:34.671]  We gotta lock them up, especially if they're young and black and they're smoking weed.
[02:12:34.691 --> 02:12:38.580]  We gotta lock them up, and we gotta put them in for a long time, because we're Democrats.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:39.702]  Yeah, but here's the thing.
[02:12:40.976 --> 02:12:48.618]  The Biden administration, which Kamala is a part of, is allowing criminals to go free currently.
[02:12:48.958 --> 02:12:49.218]  Yes.
[02:12:49.318 --> 02:13:04.302]  So even apart from the fact that she has this history of locking up black people for minor crimes, now they have a history of ensuring crime continues unpunished so that, you know, the destruction of the cities can happen.
[02:13:04.542 --> 02:13:13.026]  And it's happening in the UK right now where they've announced that they're going to release like 5,000 criminals so they can make room for these people that are promoting hate speech and violence as they say it online.
[02:13:13.366 --> 02:13:21.049]  And the funny thing about it is, speaking of the Bible, it's straight biblical, this idea of releasing Barabbas so that you can crucify Jesus.
[02:13:21.269 --> 02:13:26.592]  That's like indicative of just like the utter depravity of a corrupt justice system.
[02:13:26.792 --> 02:13:28.953]  It's straight biblical what they're doing.
[02:13:29.313 --> 02:13:29.473]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.103 --> 02:13:34.064]  I don't know who this woman is.
[02:13:34.084 --> 02:13:36.625]  She's not on the list.
[02:13:37.285 --> 02:13:39.486]  I don't know.
[02:13:39.547 --> 02:13:40.867]  When's Booty Juice coming on?
[02:13:41.247 --> 02:13:43.189]  Well, next is supposed to be Josh Shapiro.
[02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:44.409]  He's the big name next.
[02:13:44.989 --> 02:13:45.950]  They're running over.
[02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:49.072]  And then, um... Maybe they skipped him.
[02:13:49.112 --> 02:13:49.932]  They might have skipped him.
[02:13:50.272 --> 02:13:50.452]  Maybe.
[02:13:50.492 --> 02:13:52.654]  Maybe he was salty.
[02:13:52.674 --> 02:13:54.495]  He might have been salty.
[02:14:00.293 --> 02:14:02.334]  I remember I was on air on this show with Owen one night.
[02:14:02.354 --> 02:14:04.855]  I can't remember what we were covering.
[02:14:04.875 --> 02:14:05.675]  It was something late.
[02:14:06.135 --> 02:14:09.316]  And he's like, do you think it's going to be Shapiro?
[02:14:09.416 --> 02:14:10.356]  It looks like it might be Shapiro.
[02:14:10.376 --> 02:14:15.958]  And I was like, there's no way she's going to select a Jewish man to be her vice president with all this Palestine-Israel stuff going on.
[02:14:16.338 --> 02:14:16.999]  I have a question.
[02:14:17.059 --> 02:14:24.361]  Do you think that it would be, because obviously no one likes her, no one really likes her apart from the select few that are here.
[02:14:24.721 --> 02:14:26.942]  Do you think that it would be too late for them to swap her out?
[02:14:28.166 --> 02:14:28.706]  To someone else?
[02:14:29.146 --> 02:14:31.867]  I don't know how they would do it legally, but legal doesn't matter.
[02:14:31.907 --> 02:14:32.287]  What do you think?
[02:14:32.307 --> 02:14:33.067]  This is Josh Shapiro.
[02:14:33.087 --> 02:14:34.008]  We actually need to hear from him.
[02:14:34.048 --> 02:14:34.288]  Go ahead.
[02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.929]  Thank you!
[02:14:39.429 --> 02:14:41.050]  Now this guy is famous for copying Obama's style.
[02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:55.334]  Two and a half centuries ago, in Philadelphia, a band of patriots declared their independence from a king and set ourselves on a path of self-determination.
[02:14:56.277 --> 02:15:00.761]  Generation after generation has embraced that responsibility.
[02:15:01.781 --> 02:15:08.827]  Ordinary Americans, rising up, demanding more, seeking justice.
[02:15:09.007 --> 02:15:16.933]  And in every chapter of our American story, we've made progress and advanced the cause of freedom.
[02:15:17.714 --> 02:15:22.658]  Today, well today we find ourselves writing that next chapter.
[02:15:23.649 --> 02:15:28.234]  Will we be a nation defined by chaos and extremism?
[02:15:28.635 --> 02:15:34.921]  The chaos candidate was what Nikki Haley, Chuck Schumer, and others called Trump for months during the primary.
[02:15:37.086 --> 02:15:40.289]  It's just like Joy, it's another installment of MKUltra psychology.
[02:15:40.309 --> 02:15:40.570]  What rights?
[02:15:40.610 --> 02:15:41.651]  What freedoms?
[02:15:41.791 --> 02:15:43.613]  What are you talking about?
[02:15:58.351 --> 02:16:02.012]  Yeah, and the further along it is, the more valuable its organs are.
[02:16:02.032 --> 02:16:04.833]  Somebody reported today they were outside the mobile Planned Parenthood van.
[02:16:18.283 --> 02:16:20.604]  And they saw, like, 25 abortions occur outside the DNC.
[02:16:20.624 --> 02:16:21.004]  What?
[02:16:21.105 --> 02:16:22.285]  There's a mobile Planned Parenthood ban.
[02:16:22.305 --> 02:16:24.246]  I know there is, but people are actually getting abortions.
[02:16:24.266 --> 02:16:24.967]  Well, it's packed.
[02:16:25.107 --> 02:16:26.347]  People pre-scheduled their appointments.
[02:16:26.367 --> 02:16:27.988]  They're going in and getting abortions in protest.
[02:16:28.008 --> 02:16:28.709]  Like, killing babies.
[02:16:28.749 --> 02:16:29.449]  Like, ha ha ha.
[02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:32.731]  They get vasectomies, too.
[02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:33.431]  God help us.
[02:16:35.972 --> 02:16:37.753]  Right.
[02:16:37.813 --> 02:16:38.634]  Abortion pills.
[02:16:38.674 --> 02:16:40.855]  They're getting the abortion pill.
[02:16:40.875 --> 02:16:42.456]  Two people walk into a Planned Parenthood ban.
[02:16:42.536 --> 02:16:43.356]  One person walks out.
[02:16:43.616 --> 02:16:43.716]  Yep.
[02:16:48.393 --> 02:16:56.781]  The kind of real freedom that comes when that child has a great public school with an awesome teacher because we believe in her future.
[02:16:56.801 --> 02:17:00.924]  How can they talk so much about caring about children when they love to kill children?
[02:17:00.984 --> 02:17:09.532]  I mean, I don't understand how you can be so passionate about abortion and passionate about children's futures in the same sentence.
[02:17:12.635 --> 02:17:13.676]  They don't go together.
[02:17:15.968 --> 02:17:16.409]  I agree.
[02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:17.550]  Pure water like Platt, Michigan?
[02:17:17.570 --> 02:17:18.070]  Pure water.
[02:17:40.698 --> 02:17:42.359]  Look at all these liberal women.
[02:17:42.399 --> 02:17:47.721]  This whole room is just, like, the dictionary image of, like, smelling your own fart.
[02:17:48.201 --> 02:17:49.241]  That's what that room is.
[02:17:49.261 --> 02:17:51.462]  They're all smelling their own farts.
[02:17:51.602 --> 02:17:53.143]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:53.163 --> 02:17:53.263]  Right.
[02:17:53.363 --> 02:17:58.185]  Everybody else hates the smell, but they love it.
[02:17:58.225 --> 02:17:58.745]  Right, Maria Z?
[02:17:58.785 --> 02:18:03.166]  These are boy jokes.
[02:18:03.607 --> 02:18:04.367]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:18:04.567 --> 02:18:05.487]  This is InfoWars.
[02:18:05.967 --> 02:18:07.308]  Women don't apply to work here.
[02:18:09.130 --> 02:18:10.150]  We would be happy to hire them.
[02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.751]  We have one.
[02:18:10.771 --> 02:18:13.392]  She's great.
[02:18:13.452 --> 02:18:14.112]  Of course.
[02:18:15.393 --> 02:18:16.693]  She's our hero.
[02:18:17.233 --> 02:18:20.395]  We like to have fun here.
[02:18:20.535 --> 02:18:21.755]  Oh, it is good fun.
[02:18:21.815 --> 02:18:22.355]  It is good fun.
[02:18:22.375 --> 02:18:23.916]  You need fun when you're watching this.
[02:18:24.276 --> 02:18:24.536]  Yeah.
[02:18:24.616 --> 02:18:27.558]  Otherwise, you will have an aneurysm.
[02:18:27.578 --> 02:18:35.041]  You'll have an uncontrollable and inexplicable desire to take a mechanical drill and relieve the pressure.
[02:18:41.596 --> 02:18:43.016]  This guy's really energetic.
[02:18:43.637 --> 02:18:50.898]  He really wanted to be VP.
[02:18:51.739 --> 02:18:57.700]  And I'm sure that he was guaranteed an amazing cabinet position.
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.340]  I bet.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:01.021]  They're doing a good job of telling them to post on Instagram.
[02:19:01.041 --> 02:19:04.842]  And they're putting up the website, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:05.582 --> 02:19:06.762]  And Dr. Jones Naturals.
[02:19:06.882 --> 02:19:09.063]  And drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:19:11.035 --> 02:19:13.336]  By the way, do you guys have next-level foundational energy in stock?
[02:19:13.657 --> 02:19:14.837]  We absolutely do.
[02:19:15.058 --> 02:19:19.440]  We have an even better product, in my opinion, Shroom Force, now 33% off.
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:23.083]  It's a gentleman's testosterone formula and Elite Mushroom Complex.
[02:19:23.423 --> 02:19:28.506]  For those of you interested in trying something like Cordyceps Mushroom, Lion's Mane, or Ashwagandha, you should check it out.
[02:19:28.706 --> 02:19:30.788]  So what, what, what does, what's it called again?
[02:19:30.808 --> 02:19:31.128]  Shroom?
[02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:32.089]  Shroom Force.
[02:19:32.189 --> 02:19:32.930]  Shroom, Shroom Force.
[02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:33.490]  What does it do?
[02:19:33.971 --> 02:19:41.077]  Basically, it's a total male mineral complex to provide support and make sure you don't have anything missing in your diet that would suppress your testosterone.
[02:19:41.398 --> 02:19:42.178]  We've got certain things.
[02:19:42.198 --> 02:19:43.219]  Perfect for Michelle Obama.
[02:19:43.279 --> 02:19:45.742]  Greek and ashwagandha that raise testosterone.
[02:19:45.762 --> 02:19:48.865]  We've got the branded form of ashwagandha that's superior to the generic.
[02:19:49.105 --> 02:19:49.265]  Yes.
[02:19:49.385 --> 02:19:52.548]  And we've got the cordyceps, mushroom and lion's mane, which are incredible.
[02:19:52.628 --> 02:19:58.812]  And ashwagandha, much similar to turmeric, though they're very different substances, have been used by, like, eastern cultures for thousands of years.
[02:19:58.852 --> 02:20:02.495]  I mean, it's very well known that these substances have incredible health benefits.
[02:20:02.755 --> 02:20:03.356]  Absolutely.
[02:20:03.376 --> 02:20:03.356]  100%.
[02:20:04.116 --> 02:20:09.380]  But I think the background and just, like, foundation of the formula is it's a total mineral complex.
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:10.541]  It's got everything in there.
[02:20:10.561 --> 02:20:15.304]  If you're missing vitamin D, it's got vitamin D. If you're missing zinc, it's got the zinc in there.
[02:20:15.324 --> 02:20:17.205]  If you're missing boron, it's got boron in there.
[02:20:17.305 --> 02:20:17.846]  It's phenomenal.
[02:20:18.166 --> 02:20:23.827]  Well, I will say that the Next Level Foundational Energy, especially if you take it for a few days in a row, it will light you up like a Christmas tree.
[02:20:23.847 --> 02:20:24.527]  It's one of my favorites.
[02:20:24.627 --> 02:20:25.888]  It's a very unique product.
[02:20:26.148 --> 02:20:30.749]  It's very, very much so a, like, gradual feeling of improvement.
[02:20:30.929 --> 02:20:31.129]  Yes.
[02:20:31.149 --> 02:20:31.949]  It may get off.
[02:20:32.009 --> 02:20:34.169]  It, like, builds up in your body over time.
[02:20:34.229 --> 02:20:36.730]  I've noticed that it's absolutely amazing, but you prefer the Shroom Force.
[02:20:36.970 --> 02:20:37.310]  I do.
[02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.950]  I do.
[02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.970]  I came up with it, so.
[02:20:39.511 --> 02:20:39.711]  Oh, nice.
[02:20:39.811 --> 02:20:40.331]  It's my formula.
[02:20:40.371 --> 02:20:45.832]  I have been putting those things together and just buying them individually for years, and I figured we might as well make it a product.
[02:20:46.352 --> 02:20:50.133]  Awesome, well let's go back to the Shapiro Force.
[02:20:51.314 --> 02:21:00.617]  Yeah, and I think there's a couple of speakers coming up who I don't recognize until Pete Buttigieg.
[02:21:00.637 --> 02:21:03.298]  So we've got Amanda Gorman, but this is gonna be a National Youth Poet Laureate.
[02:21:03.318 --> 02:21:03.839]  We gotta watch this.
[02:21:03.859 --> 02:21:04.919]  This is gonna be a performance, I bet.
[02:21:13.977 --> 02:21:21.660]  We gather at this hallowed place because we believe in the American dream.
[02:21:22.501 --> 02:21:28.923]  We face a race that tests if this country we cherish shall perish from the earth.
[02:21:28.943 --> 02:21:30.744]  And if our earth shall perish from this country.
[02:21:35.886 --> 02:21:45.054]  It falls to us to ensure that we do not fall for a people that cannot stand together, cannot stand at all.
[02:21:46.134 --> 02:21:53.300]  We are one family, regardless of religion, class, or color.
[02:21:53.801 --> 02:21:58.484]  For what defines a patriot is not just our love of liberty, but our love for one another.
[02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:11.432]  I like how she missed the hair that she was trying to pull away from her face.
[02:22:11.452 --> 02:22:20.614]  This is loud in our country's call because while we all love freedom, it is love that frees us all.
[02:22:20.814 --> 02:22:22.635]  We're witnessing a Raygun moment live.
[02:22:27.074 --> 02:22:33.795]  Empathy emancipates, making us greater than hate or vanity.
[02:22:33.816 --> 02:22:38.777]  That is the American promise, powerful and pure.
[02:22:38.937 --> 02:22:40.237]  Is she wearing a cape?
[02:22:40.297 --> 02:22:41.337]  It's called Star Wars outfits.
[02:22:41.517 --> 02:22:43.158]  They're called cape sleeves.
[02:22:43.178 --> 02:22:43.258]  Yes.
[02:22:43.278 --> 02:22:44.298]  Star Wars outfits.
[02:22:44.358 --> 02:22:45.138]  It is very Star Wars.
[02:22:45.178 --> 02:22:45.718]  Rebel Alliance.
[02:22:46.078 --> 02:22:48.139]  Rebel Alliance Star Wars outfits.
[02:22:48.179 --> 02:22:48.299]  Yeah.
[02:22:48.359 --> 02:22:49.199]  Little bit capital.
[02:22:49.219 --> 02:22:54.140]  I bet you ten bucks she's in a Disney produced Star Wars spinoff.
[02:22:55.610 --> 02:23:00.311]  Well, DNC is great for your career.
[02:23:00.332 --> 02:23:01.292]  Oh yeah.
[02:23:02.072 --> 02:23:02.932]  Co-hearing?
[02:23:04.853 --> 02:23:07.794]  Maybe we're too dumb to know that's a word.
[02:23:08.234 --> 02:23:09.134]  Is it a word?
[02:23:09.194 --> 02:23:09.654]  Co-hearing?
[02:23:09.674 --> 02:23:10.695]  What does co-hearing mean?
[02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:12.035]  Does it mean hearing together?
[02:23:12.055 --> 02:23:12.835]  Did she make up a word?
[02:23:12.875 --> 02:23:13.636]  I mean she's a poet.
[02:23:21.813 --> 02:23:30.303]  Only now, approaching this rare era, are we aware that perhaps the American dream is no dream at all.
[02:23:30.864 --> 02:23:35.469]  But instead, I dare to dream together.
[02:23:36.350 --> 02:23:37.531]  Oh, we gotta dream together.
[02:23:37.551 --> 02:23:39.574]  Oh yeah, we gotta enter a mass delusion.
[02:23:42.426 --> 02:23:43.387]  I'm tweeting this right now.
[02:23:43.407 --> 02:23:44.228]  This is unbelievable.
[02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:45.570]  The American Dream is no dream at all.
[02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:47.111]  What is she doing with her hands?
[02:23:47.131 --> 02:23:47.972]  She's a power warrior.
[02:23:47.992 --> 02:23:54.219]  As the great George Carlin said, the American Dream is called a dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:23:54.259 --> 02:23:54.820]  There you go.
[02:24:04.176 --> 02:24:10.239]  We redeem this sacred scene, ready for our journey from it.
[02:24:10.299 --> 02:24:15.901]  Together, we must birth this early republic and achieve an unearthly summit.
[02:24:15.941 --> 02:24:19.722]  Let us not just believe in the American dream.
[02:24:19.883 --> 02:24:22.123]  Let us be worthy of it.
[02:24:42.152 --> 02:24:43.873]  I'm feeling really uninspired, guys.
[02:24:44.793 --> 02:24:45.233]  How about you?
[02:24:45.393 --> 02:24:46.294]  I'm actually fired up.
[02:24:47.915 --> 02:24:48.695]  Are you full of joy?
[02:24:48.715 --> 02:24:52.056]  Do you feel energized and full of joy?
[02:24:52.156 --> 02:24:55.017]  I am energized by how backward this is.
[02:24:55.037 --> 02:25:04.161]  It's like when you see somebody who's slightly better at something that you're passionate about than you are, and it just pushes you to do better and fight back.
[02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:05.962]  Not that they're better at what we do than
[02:25:06.562 --> 02:25:07.162]  No, no, no, no.
[02:25:07.202 --> 02:25:08.222]  This is very important.
[02:25:08.262 --> 02:25:10.303]  They are to be respected as an enemy.
[02:25:10.323 --> 02:25:10.983]  Right.
[02:25:11.643 --> 02:25:24.206]  The big thing that made me go off the Trump train in 2020 and lose my mind basically over this stuff is I saw these middle-aged women twerking in the street to Trump rap music as the election was about to be lost and it just blew my mind.
[02:25:24.366 --> 02:25:24.566]  Right.
[02:25:24.686 --> 02:25:28.267]  And that attitude has to be completely divorced from anyone in the populist movement.
[02:25:28.287 --> 02:25:28.427]  Right.
[02:25:28.447 --> 02:25:29.088]  This isn't fun.
[02:25:29.128 --> 02:25:29.688]  This is war.
[02:25:29.848 --> 02:25:30.288]  Yeah.
[02:25:30.408 --> 02:25:32.708]  When we joke, we tell the jokes for a reason.
[02:25:32.728 --> 02:25:34.269]  It's because it's too horrible not to.
[02:25:34.329 --> 02:25:34.549]  Yes.
[02:25:35.049 --> 02:25:35.410]  Exactly.
[02:25:35.430 --> 02:25:36.572]  It's a coping mechanism, frankly.
[02:25:36.592 --> 02:25:36.653]  Yes.
[02:25:36.673 --> 02:25:39.559]  Like, what else are you supposed to say to that than something sarcastic sometimes?
[02:25:39.699 --> 02:25:39.979]  Exactly.
[02:25:39.999 --> 02:25:40.160]  Yeah.
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:40.721]  You know?
[02:25:40.741 --> 02:25:41.943]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:25:42.665 --> 02:25:43.386]  I don't know what to think.
[02:25:43.887 --> 02:25:45.671]  I guess, oh, are they running some ad about families?
[02:25:46.513 --> 02:25:47.934]  Let's see a little bit of this, just a little bit.
[02:25:48.014 --> 02:25:50.756]  Oh, my husband.
[02:25:51.757 --> 02:25:53.458]  Why is it not plural?
[02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:54.859]  Why are you not poly?
[02:25:54.939 --> 02:26:02.044]  Yeah, the fact that they're monogamous is way too traditional.
[02:26:02.084 --> 02:26:04.045]  How is Trump going to stop you from doing that?
[02:26:04.065 --> 02:26:08.629]  Do you think they'll show a single white heterosexual relationship?
[02:26:08.669 --> 02:26:10.230]  They were the ones that shut down churches.
[02:26:10.650 --> 02:26:14.213]  This person looks like they're struggling with their mental health.
[02:26:16.314 --> 02:26:18.655]  It'd be funny if they were all wearing hard hats just for no reason.
[02:26:18.675 --> 02:26:18.895]  We can tell.
[02:26:18.915 --> 02:26:20.916]  I was just thinking I didn't know how to say it without being totally bigoted.
[02:26:20.936 --> 02:26:21.796]  There's your poly couple.
[02:26:21.836 --> 02:26:22.177]  Trifunctu.
[02:26:22.217 --> 02:26:22.417]  Trifecta.
[02:26:43.446 --> 02:26:46.368]  They did this with the guy with ALS on the first night.
[02:26:46.388 --> 02:26:47.589]  They brought him out and his wife.
[02:26:47.609 --> 02:26:51.111]  Yes, they're exploiting disabled people.
[02:26:51.491 --> 02:26:53.012]  Oh my god.
[02:26:54.253 --> 02:26:57.115]  I genuinely feel bad for that person, so I'm not gonna make a joke about this.
[02:26:57.135 --> 02:26:58.216]  But the fact that they're exploiting...
[02:27:04.158 --> 02:27:08.021]  Who's saying Trump would stop this person from having access to medical care?
[02:27:08.041 --> 02:27:09.622]  Trump is actually the reason that person can't walk.
[02:27:09.662 --> 02:27:11.984]  If you vote for Trump, you're making that person cry.
[02:27:12.104 --> 02:27:13.085]  That's the pitch of the ad.
[02:27:13.165 --> 02:27:13.986]  That's what we're telling you.
[02:27:14.066 --> 02:27:16.528]  If you want to make these people cry, vote for Trump.
[02:27:16.548 --> 02:27:18.209]  If you don't do it, good, you vote for us.
[02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:19.470]  It's just a guilt trip.
[02:27:19.791 --> 02:27:20.851]  It's a guilt campaign.
[02:27:21.052 --> 02:27:23.834]  These people are masters of it and it has to be respected.
[02:27:24.174 --> 02:27:29.939]  It's art in a beautifully disgusting, morbid way what they've been able to do and what they're able to still do.
[02:27:30.239 --> 02:27:30.600]  You're right.
[02:27:42.907 --> 02:27:46.628]  ...live up to its highest ideals and, you know, we're proud to go to work.
[02:27:47.368 --> 02:27:51.149]  The work to build a better future really depends on all of us.
[02:27:51.850 --> 02:27:53.150]  I want all these people to succeed.
[02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:58.111]  I love how they do the aesthetic where the person's still talking but then it's a still zoom into their face.
[02:27:58.532 --> 02:28:06.314]  I want all the people on this ad to do well but at the same time they're all being paid probably like 10k each by the Democratic Party so screw them!
[02:28:07.136 --> 02:28:07.476]  Right?
[02:28:08.196 --> 02:28:11.958]  These people are politically unaware enough to get in bed with the devil!
[02:28:12.898 --> 02:28:18.021]  Rex, you raised a really good point before about the fact that these people are really good at this.
[02:28:18.421 --> 02:28:18.921]  And they are.
[02:28:19.701 --> 02:28:28.505]  And, you know, I've had conversations with people in recent times who are like, you know, at what point do we start using their tactics against them?
[02:28:28.525 --> 02:28:33.567]  And it's like, to a degree, conservatives aren't able to do that because we're not dishonest.
[02:28:33.967 --> 02:28:35.648]  We're not evil at our core.
[02:28:36.568 --> 02:28:41.169]  Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, I just, I love that you say that, it jogged my memory, it made me think about something.
[02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:46.791]  I like calling these people racist, fascist, Nazis, because that's what they are.
[02:28:46.931 --> 02:28:50.212]  And that's their language, that's what they call us, unjustly, wrongly.
[02:28:50.472 --> 02:28:53.073]  We have to just reflect, we have to out-liberal them, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:53.693 --> 02:28:54.974]  Like, these people are fascists.
[02:28:55.114 --> 02:28:57.456]  I don't like seeing this fascist, Nazi stuff in my country.
[02:28:57.857 --> 02:28:59.018]  That's my honest opinion.
[02:28:59.418 --> 02:29:01.100]  When I see a Trump rally, I don't think Nazi.
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.183]  When I hear 17-year-olds that are coached to say auntie, I think Nazi.
[02:29:05.203 --> 02:29:09.066]  They literally sent $63 billion to Nazis on Hitler's birthday this year, April 20th.
[02:29:10.633 --> 02:29:11.474]  It's time to stop.
[02:29:11.494 --> 02:29:12.554]  It was on Hitler's birthday.
[02:29:12.574 --> 02:29:13.554]  Saturday, April 20th.
[02:29:13.915 --> 02:29:14.175]  Wow.
[02:29:14.355 --> 02:29:15.895]  They didn't do it on purpose on Hitler's birthday.
[02:29:15.915 --> 02:29:18.036]  It was just a mad universe coincidence.
[02:29:18.056 --> 02:29:18.556]  They might have.
[02:29:18.817 --> 02:29:19.537]  They might have.
[02:29:20.037 --> 02:29:22.038]  And they applauded it with Ukrainian flags in our own Congress.
[02:29:22.058 --> 02:29:23.298]  These people are literally not fascists.
[02:29:23.338 --> 02:29:28.861]  With the Democrats, you know the old saying, never assume malice when stupidity would make the sense.
[02:29:28.961 --> 02:29:30.421]  I believe that's Occam's razor.
[02:29:30.481 --> 02:29:31.582]  Nah, that's a different one.
[02:29:31.602 --> 02:29:32.542]  It's somebody else's razor.
[02:29:32.562 --> 02:29:34.223]  Yeah, it's someone else's razor theorem.
[02:29:34.483 --> 02:29:36.404]  With the Democrats, it's the other way around.
[02:29:36.644 --> 02:29:39.325]  Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity or something like that.
[02:29:39.365 --> 02:29:41.666]  Yeah, but don't attribute to stupidity what could be malice.
[02:29:41.766 --> 02:29:44.127]  Like, everything they do is evil.
[02:29:44.227 --> 02:29:47.168]  And that's the little finger from Game of Thrones philosophy, right?
[02:29:47.208 --> 02:29:49.669]  Assume the worst intentions and then work backwards from there.
[02:29:49.709 --> 02:29:50.809]  So yeah, I agree with that.
[02:29:51.129 --> 02:29:54.731]  That's a mistaken... It's an interesting... Only the paranoid survive.
[02:29:55.111 --> 02:29:56.631]  Only the paranoid... That's true.
[02:29:56.871 --> 02:29:57.372]  That's true.
[02:29:57.652 --> 02:29:57.852]  Yeah.
[02:29:59.052 --> 02:30:02.416]  By the way, get Life Select storable food at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[02:30:02.436 --> 02:30:07.481]  It's got 25 years shelf life and get it with the Alexa Pure Water Filter so you can actually prepare the storable food with clean water.
[02:30:07.861 --> 02:30:09.643]  In the apocalypse, only the paranoid survive.
[02:30:09.803 --> 02:30:10.644]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:11.585 --> 02:30:11.805]  Nice.
[02:30:12.125 --> 02:30:16.630]  Now that I'm here, I'm about to buy an Alexa Pure Water Filter, so I will let you know how it goes.
[02:30:16.650 --> 02:30:17.170]  They're awesome.
[02:30:17.251 --> 02:30:17.571]  I have one.
[02:30:17.651 --> 02:30:18.672]  I keep hearing great things.
[02:30:18.692 --> 02:30:19.973]  I bought one before I worked here as a fan.
[02:30:20.013 --> 02:30:21.795]  I spent like two grand one day on InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:21.815 --> 02:30:22.516]  My wife wanted to kill me.
[02:30:23.689 --> 02:30:24.929]  Oh, it's Oprah!
[02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:26.770]  You get a car!
[02:30:26.850 --> 02:30:28.610]  You get a car!
[02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:30.231]  Look under your chair!
[02:30:30.251 --> 02:30:34.972]  Oh my god, they brought out Oprah.
[02:30:35.992 --> 02:30:37.453]  I'm starting to get the douche chills.
[02:30:37.473 --> 02:30:38.433]  This is too much for me.
[02:30:40.473 --> 02:30:42.334]  Who says you can't go home again?
[02:30:47.859 --> 02:30:53.083]  After watching the Obamas last night, that was some epic fire, wasn't it?
[02:30:53.163 --> 02:30:54.744]  Some epic fire!
[02:30:54.764 --> 02:30:58.807]  Another pink pantsuit, Maria Z. How does she get younger?
[02:30:59.147 --> 02:31:03.049]  We can't wait to leave here and do something!
[02:31:08.593 --> 02:31:16.278]  And what we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States!
[02:31:20.854 --> 02:31:23.435]  How much adrenochrome do you think she's had over her lifetime?
[02:31:24.016 --> 02:31:25.436]  So many babies.
[02:31:25.937 --> 02:31:33.400]  Yeah, I think that as many babies had to die to get her adrenochrome as trees had to die to fill the Project 2025 book that they printed.
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:34.000]  Gosh, that's so dark.
[02:31:38.490 --> 02:31:39.651]  Thousands.
[02:31:39.951 --> 02:31:41.251]  Oh, Doc.
[02:31:41.531 --> 02:31:44.152]  But yeah, you can pay for a whole new body these days.
[02:31:44.232 --> 02:31:46.213]  It's Doc because they say we'll do this.
[02:31:46.233 --> 02:31:48.374]  She's getting younger because she's reading Maya Angelou.
[02:31:48.394 --> 02:31:49.015]  Oh, books are dangerous.
[02:31:57.446 --> 02:31:59.107]  And assault rifles are safe.
[02:31:59.268 --> 02:32:02.350]  Well, you guys think the Project 2025 book is dangerous?
[02:32:04.031 --> 02:32:08.055]  You made a book that didn't exist to call it dangerous, you dumb bitch.
[02:32:08.375 --> 02:32:10.717]  And then to conquer.
[02:32:11.838 --> 02:32:12.638]  But here's the thing.
[02:32:13.639 --> 02:32:18.363]  When we stand together, it is impossible to conquer us.
[02:32:23.103 --> 02:32:23.623]  By your hand.
[02:32:24.644 --> 02:32:26.384]  Not everything is a Marvel movie.
[02:32:26.705 --> 02:32:27.605]  I'm so sick of this.
[02:32:27.725 --> 02:32:32.207]  In the words of an extraordinary American, the late Congressman John Lewis.
[02:32:32.227 --> 02:32:37.890]  I wanted my answer like that.
[02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:44.332]  He said, no matter what ship our ancestors arrived on, we are all in the same boat now.
[02:32:44.373 --> 02:32:45.653]  Rex, nobody remembers that guy.
[02:32:46.614 --> 02:32:48.134]  Oh, he was important to the Democratic Party.
[02:32:48.174 --> 02:32:50.295]  He was an important guy.
[02:32:50.455 --> 02:32:51.676]  But he's dead now.
[02:32:52.523 --> 02:32:53.824]  Hey Oprah, let's talk about Maui.
[02:32:53.864 --> 02:32:55.505]  I'd rather talk about Mao.
[02:32:55.525 --> 02:32:55.746]  So quick.
[02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:56.546]  Okay, she's so quick.
[02:32:56.566 --> 02:32:56.606]  Oh.
[02:33:18.362 --> 02:33:19.283]  You did that!
[02:33:19.343 --> 02:33:20.544]  Auntie Kamala!
[02:33:21.404 --> 02:33:22.645]  Putting in the hard work!
[02:33:27.089 --> 02:33:30.212]  You say the wrong thing because you're stupid and they turn it into a campaign slogan?
[02:33:30.572 --> 02:33:31.873]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[02:33:31.913 --> 02:33:42.361]  I think it was Liberace who said that he was famous for if he would make a mistake on the piano, when he was performing a piece live, he would make the same mistake every time that section came up again, so it seemed intentional.
[02:33:42.401 --> 02:33:42.822]  Right.
[02:33:45.624 --> 02:33:45.924]  Was he?
[02:33:46.424 --> 02:33:46.505]  Oh!
[02:33:47.455 --> 02:33:48.415]  She's so hot in that movie.
[02:33:48.435 --> 02:33:51.696]  Something's wrong with you.
[02:33:51.856 --> 02:33:54.697]  I ain't no ways tired.
[02:34:00.418 --> 02:34:03.819]  Why do they all have rainbow things on?
[02:34:04.019 --> 02:34:05.459]  Because they like to gaze.
[02:34:05.479 --> 02:34:06.499]  Was that a serious question or easy?
[02:34:12.108 --> 02:34:14.849]  I'm just wondering, did they, like, give them out at the door?
[02:34:14.889 --> 02:34:16.030]  Everyone's got the same rainbow.
[02:34:16.050 --> 02:34:16.350]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:16.370 --> 02:34:16.951]  Yeah, they give them out.
[02:34:16.971 --> 02:34:20.572]  It's just like, because they like the game.
[02:34:20.612 --> 02:34:24.394]  Well, that's why they had those giant banner flags, too, like the rectangular prisms.
[02:34:24.675 --> 02:34:27.336]  So if anybody leaves, you can't really tell from an overhead shot.
[02:34:27.396 --> 02:34:29.177]  It looks like the whole auditorium is full with those.
[02:34:29.277 --> 02:34:30.178]  Right.
[02:34:30.478 --> 02:34:33.439]  Hey, is this a monkey pox super spreader event?
[02:34:33.499 --> 02:34:36.381]  No, that's just the Senate hearing room.
[02:34:36.401 --> 02:34:36.901]  Oh, my mistake.
[02:34:41.294 --> 02:34:45.616]  Who make me proud to say that I am an American.
[02:34:46.297 --> 02:34:53.061]  Anyone in the audience that has access and doesn't have a drinking problem, take a shot for me, because I can't drink tonight and I can't stand this.
[02:34:53.161 --> 02:35:00.385]  And despite what some would have you think, we are not so different from our neighbors.
[02:35:01.065 --> 02:35:05.248]  When a house is on fire, we don't ask about the homeowner's race or religion.
[02:35:06.496 --> 02:35:10.597]  We don't wonder who their partner is or how they voted.
[02:35:10.697 --> 02:35:11.137]  No!
[02:35:12.038 --> 02:35:15.199]  We just try to do the best we can to save them.
[02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:30.443]  And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady... I mean, like, that's what's up.
[02:35:30.663 --> 02:35:31.704]  Like, the single moms.
[02:35:32.164 --> 02:35:33.084]  The child tax credit.
[02:35:33.284 --> 02:35:34.985]  That's the whole message of what you're running on.
[02:35:36.021 --> 02:35:43.746]  Did any of these people care to try to understand why they were referred to as... Oh, that lady has coloured strips in her hair.
[02:35:43.826 --> 02:35:45.107]  Definitely belongs there.
[02:35:45.127 --> 02:35:47.028]  That's like the number one red flag.
[02:35:47.068 --> 02:35:48.509]  Carrier of monkey pops.
[02:35:48.569 --> 02:35:51.071]  Do women even get it?
[02:35:51.351 --> 02:35:54.493]  Sorry, Rex.
[02:35:54.513 --> 02:35:54.954]  No, my bad.
[02:35:54.994 --> 02:35:55.894]  I completely stepped on this.
[02:35:55.934 --> 02:35:56.855]  No, no, it's totally fine.
[02:35:56.915 --> 02:35:59.096]  But do you know what is unbelievable?
[02:35:59.176 --> 02:36:01.058]  It's totally fine.
[02:36:01.078 --> 02:36:02.359]  What's the most unbelievable thing?
[02:36:02.379 --> 02:36:05.381]  I responded to Tedros in a fury of anger today.
[02:36:06.301 --> 02:36:14.404]  Because the countries that he's saying monkeypox is spreading like Uganda and I believe Kenya.
[02:36:14.464 --> 02:36:15.944]  Are all the same countries where AIDS spread?
[02:36:17.025 --> 02:36:20.326]  Well, I'm just thinking whether Kenya is one of them but Congo.
[02:36:21.226 --> 02:36:31.890]  Anyway, definitely Uganda and three of the four countries that are listed on the WHO's latest report are all countries where homosexuality is illegal.
[02:36:33.390 --> 02:36:42.475]  Now, monkeypox is predominantly a disease that spreads between men who engage... Yeah, because it causes bleeding and blood-to-blood contact.
[02:36:42.515 --> 02:36:43.555]  Correct.
[02:36:43.595 --> 02:36:48.078]  Now they're saying that all of a sudden it's spreading from animals to humans because of climate change.
[02:36:48.098 --> 02:36:49.278]  Well, they said the same thing about AIDS.
[02:36:49.718 --> 02:36:50.079]  Right.
[02:36:50.379 --> 02:36:53.240]  But, you know, initially it was this.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:56.642]  So how is it happening in all these countries where homosexuality is illegal?
[02:36:56.662 --> 02:36:57.903]  Like, the chances are very low.
[02:36:57.943 --> 02:36:58.783]  People still do it.
[02:36:59.383 --> 02:37:01.604]  I get that, Chase, but the culture...
[02:37:03.268 --> 02:37:03.708]  I don't know.
[02:37:03.728 --> 02:37:04.628]  The more taboo it is.
[02:37:04.648 --> 02:37:05.669]  I think there's more.
[02:37:05.709 --> 02:37:07.269]  Sodomy is legal in like half the states.
[02:37:07.289 --> 02:37:09.670]  Have you seen the White House?
[02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:16.172]  Do you know how much gay sex and little boy rape happens in Middle Eastern countries where like homosexuality is enough to get thrown off a building?
[02:37:16.212 --> 02:37:17.652]  Well yes, you're not wrong about that.
[02:37:17.932 --> 02:37:19.312]  It's like the hidden...
[02:37:21.713 --> 02:37:22.934]  Is it prosecuted, you know?
[02:37:22.994 --> 02:37:30.661]  Like, technically, I think, um, like, fellatio is illegal in half the states of the union that have old morality laws from, like, a hundred years ago.
[02:37:30.681 --> 02:37:32.542]  It's just one of those laws that nobody enforces.
[02:37:32.563 --> 02:37:33.003]  That's correct, Chase.
[02:37:33.023 --> 02:37:33.263]  Right?
[02:37:33.343 --> 02:37:33.844]  That is correct.
[02:37:33.864 --> 02:37:34.965]  Yeah, Rex knows that law.
[02:37:34.985 --> 02:37:35.525]  That's correct.
[02:37:36.106 --> 02:37:37.046]  Very interesting, Chase.
[02:37:37.427 --> 02:37:39.849]  Interesting point.
[02:37:40.329 --> 02:37:43.232]  And make no mistake, they are the best of America.
[02:37:45.649 --> 02:37:53.856]  The crazy thing is, they've come out and they've admitted monkeypox is spreading predominantly between homosexual men and children adjacent to those communities.
[02:37:54.316 --> 02:37:57.979]  So children are getting it, who are being abused by homosexual men.
[02:37:58.019 --> 02:38:10.209]  The last time that they were trying to make a pandemic out of this, Walensky announced that two cases of children had been found in America and all of a sudden monkeypox went away.
[02:38:11.272 --> 02:38:13.734]  They don't want to admit that pedophilia is associated with homosexuality.
[02:38:13.754 --> 02:38:18.338]  Well, she announces that children courted from two men from the homosexual community.
[02:38:18.478 --> 02:38:18.738]  Yeah.
[02:38:18.938 --> 02:38:21.661]  So how did they catch it when you told us it's only through sex?
[02:38:21.681 --> 02:38:22.481]  They got raped.
[02:38:22.882 --> 02:38:26.505]  Now, Uganda in particular, not very fond of that behavior.
[02:38:26.545 --> 02:38:29.867]  Like, they're predominantly very conservative.
[02:38:29.887 --> 02:38:32.149]  Well, I interviewed Barack Obama's half-brother, Malik.
[02:38:32.549 --> 02:38:33.050]  Amazing.
[02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:35.572]  And I said, do you think that Barack Obama's gay?
[02:38:35.752 --> 02:38:37.854]  And he said, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:38:40.649 --> 02:38:41.370]  That's pretty good.
[02:38:41.390 --> 02:38:42.370]  You got the Malik in her?
[02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:43.151]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:43.251 --> 02:38:43.791]  Yeah, I got it.
[02:38:43.811 --> 02:38:46.773]  We got it out of the American Journal one morning a few months ago.
[02:38:46.813 --> 02:38:47.814]  Last December, I think.
[02:38:47.974 --> 02:38:49.615]  With the smoke this fire.
[02:38:50.115 --> 02:38:51.055]  He's wearing a MAGA hat.
[02:38:52.416 --> 02:38:54.838]  These tweets are the best.
[02:38:54.878 --> 02:38:57.760]  He's like, I will do the interview for $5,000.
[02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:01.762]  I said, we can't pay you because we're in bankruptcy, but we will plug your book.
[02:39:01.782 --> 02:39:02.803]  He said, OK, I'll do it.
[02:39:08.379 --> 02:39:14.243]  Like Ruby Bridges and her friends, Leona and Gayle.
[02:39:15.524 --> 02:39:17.585]  The New Orleans Four, they were called.
[02:39:18.686 --> 02:39:22.248]  They broke barriers and they paid dearly for it.
[02:39:23.289 --> 02:39:32.575]  But it was the grace and guts and courage of women like Tessie Prevost Williams that paved the way for another young girl.
[02:39:33.576 --> 02:39:41.719]  Who nine years later became part of the second class to integrate the public schools in Berkeley, California.
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.221]  And it seems to me...
[02:39:47.833 --> 02:39:58.597]  That at school and at home, somebody did a beautiful job of showing this young girl how to challenge the people at the top and empower the people at the bottom.
[02:39:58.657 --> 02:40:03.938]  They showed her how to look at the world and see not just what is, but what can be.
[02:40:04.018 --> 02:40:14.142]  They instilled in her a passion for justice and freedom and the glorious fighting spirit necessary to pursue that passion.
[02:40:14.942 --> 02:40:17.023]  And soon and very soon,
[02:40:21.512 --> 02:40:22.553]  Oh, the tears again!
[02:40:22.573 --> 02:40:24.695]  The cult of personality.
[02:40:24.755 --> 02:40:31.461]  But I tell you what, she can still speak.
[02:40:31.542 --> 02:40:33.403]  She's not slipped yet.
[02:40:33.443 --> 02:40:34.685]  She's not old enough, I guess.
[02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:35.265]  What'd she say?
[02:40:35.285 --> 02:40:37.307]  This child of an Indian mother and a what?
[02:40:37.347 --> 02:40:38.128]  Jamaican father.
[02:40:38.228 --> 02:40:38.408]  Yeah.
[02:40:38.508 --> 02:40:38.909]  Jamaican.
[02:40:39.149 --> 02:40:39.810]  So not black.
[02:40:40.570 --> 02:40:42.152]  Well, black, but not African-American.
[02:40:43.033 --> 02:40:43.093]  Oh.
[02:40:44.625 --> 02:40:46.046]  That's the real dispute.
[02:40:46.066 --> 02:40:47.266]  The Indian's not black.
[02:40:47.446 --> 02:40:48.987]  Right, she's half Indian, half black.
[02:40:49.027 --> 02:40:50.448]  She's Brahmin cast, too.
[02:40:50.548 --> 02:40:53.589]  So, like, you understand those people have untouchables in their society.
[02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:54.010]  Yes.
[02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.310]  Yeah.
[02:40:54.470 --> 02:40:57.231]  So, like, we're the good people.
[02:40:57.271 --> 02:40:58.792]  Hey, we out here in these streets.
[02:40:59.292 --> 02:40:59.712]  That's right.
[02:40:59.772 --> 02:41:01.173]  We out here in these streets.
[02:41:01.273 --> 02:41:02.534]  We out here in these streets.
[02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:10.898]  Do you think that Kamala Harris is the first black woman that Tim Wallace has actually spent, like, more than an hour with?
[02:41:13.257 --> 02:41:16.079]  Uh, Tim Boltz hasn't spent an hour with any black woman.
[02:41:16.999 --> 02:41:17.519]  Technically.
[02:41:17.539 --> 02:41:20.821]  Do you think she's the first Indian woman?
[02:41:22.202 --> 02:41:22.482]  Yes.
[02:41:23.183 --> 02:41:24.984]  Oprah's really got a lion's mane.
[02:41:25.544 --> 02:41:28.045]  Yeah, she does look like Mufasa.
[02:41:28.205 --> 02:41:28.706]  Yes!
[02:41:29.526 --> 02:41:33.028]  Everything the light touches is your kingdom, Kupacabra.
[02:41:37.090 --> 02:41:38.791]  It's Mufasa Winfrey!
[02:41:38.811 --> 02:41:41.773]  Look at the stars, Simba.
[02:41:43.226 --> 02:41:44.106]  Quote Maya Angelou.
[02:41:44.126 --> 02:41:46.207]  Otherwise it's not really Oprah, it's a clone.
[02:42:06.737 --> 02:42:09.799]  She was too cute to be at the DNC.
[02:42:09.859 --> 02:42:10.020]  So sad.
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:10.580]  It's not common.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:10.680]  Yeah.
[02:42:22.310 --> 02:42:24.972]  You know Owen was saying this a while ago.
[02:42:25.012 --> 02:42:27.714]  He's like, how come all the hot women are conservatives?
[02:42:27.734 --> 02:42:28.514]  Like, what is it?
[02:42:28.694 --> 02:42:32.036]  They have hot ones, they're just crazy.
[02:42:32.056 --> 02:42:33.457]  You know I'm telling you the truth.
[02:42:33.898 --> 02:42:38.741]  That values and character matter most of all.
[02:42:38.761 --> 02:42:45.185]  Do the live action Lion King.
[02:42:45.325 --> 02:42:46.946]  She looks more like the CGI one.
[02:42:50.432 --> 02:42:51.636]  You must run for president.
[02:42:58.271 --> 02:43:01.573]  And he fraud the American people.
[02:43:01.673 --> 02:43:03.094]  They have too much money, Kamala.
[02:43:03.274 --> 02:43:04.075]  He must take it.
[02:43:04.095 --> 02:43:05.976]  Take it now.
[02:43:06.016 --> 02:43:06.857]  Take the cash.
[02:43:07.477 --> 02:43:08.818]  But how?
[02:43:09.158 --> 02:43:09.338]  How?
[02:43:09.358 --> 02:43:10.159]  They have guns.
[02:43:10.419 --> 02:43:11.300]  Ban the guns.
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:12.921]  Ban the guns now.
[02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:20.906]  Common Sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect.
[02:43:21.326 --> 02:43:22.667]  They're the ones who give it to us.
[02:43:22.687 --> 02:43:23.868]  With the yellow eyes.
[02:43:25.467 --> 02:43:26.528]  We are Americans.
[02:43:26.929 --> 02:43:28.150]  That's a really sad saying, though.
[02:43:28.170 --> 02:43:28.911]  We are Americans.
[02:43:29.671 --> 02:43:34.897]  Let us choose loyalty to the Constitution over loyalty to any individual.
[02:43:34.917 --> 02:43:39.461]  Because that's the best of Americans.
[02:43:39.521 --> 02:43:40.202]  Nobody told her that.
[02:43:40.222 --> 02:43:41.904]  She looked like a lion.
[02:43:41.984 --> 02:43:47.450]  It's like Joy Reid not realizing that she was wearing a wig that was Donald Trump's hair for weeks until somebody gave her shit and she shaved her head.
[02:43:48.090 --> 02:43:48.571]  You remember that?
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:52.721]  Like, somebody's gotta say you look like a lion lady.
[02:43:53.001 --> 02:43:55.482]  She hurt the ozone layer getting her hair set up.
[02:43:55.502 --> 02:43:55.902]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:56.322 --> 02:43:56.862]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:56.902 --> 02:43:57.882]  Yeah, the amount of aerosol.
[02:44:00.083 --> 02:44:01.924]  Kanye was doing whippets right behind her the whole time.
[02:44:02.324 --> 02:44:02.924]  How many betas?
[02:44:02.944 --> 02:44:04.845]  That's the best of America!
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:14.686]  And let us choose the sweet promise of tomorrow over the bitter return to yesterday.
[02:44:15.106 --> 02:44:18.469]  Oh, you mean a future unburdened, what can be unburdened by what has been?
[02:44:18.489 --> 02:44:22.653]  We will be set back, pushed back, bullied back, kicked back.
[02:44:22.953 --> 02:44:24.114]  We're not going back.
[02:44:24.815 --> 02:44:26.937]  Going back to what?
[02:44:26.977 --> 02:44:28.718]  What are you talking about?
[02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:30.340]  Democratic Socialist Communism.
[02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:31.821]  I want it now.
[02:44:31.861 --> 02:44:33.282]  Not going back to what?
[02:44:33.642 --> 02:44:35.144]  What are you cheering about?
[02:44:38.846 --> 02:44:45.070]  Well, not going back to Trump as president is what it really means.
[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:48.952]  But they try to use the double entendre, like, not going backwards.
[02:44:49.353 --> 02:44:58.438]  Even their USA signs that they give out to the audience and stuff... Even their USA signs, they're fraudulent almost.
[02:44:58.458 --> 02:45:00.880]  Like, if you look at their pro-America... She just sang the word joy.
[02:45:01.593 --> 02:45:02.373]  Oh, she didn't.
[02:45:03.014 --> 02:45:05.295]  Let us choose joy!
[02:45:06.075 --> 02:45:07.976]  Oh my God, you're Maoist!
[02:45:07.996 --> 02:45:13.119]  She doesn't even know it.
[02:45:13.519 --> 02:45:16.040]  I know what they mean when they say we're not going back.
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:16.580]  I get it.
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:18.221]  Yeah, I get that you get it.
[02:45:18.301 --> 02:45:19.662]  I knew that you get it.
[02:45:19.722 --> 02:45:21.042]  But do they actually get it?
[02:45:21.062 --> 02:45:22.843]  I don't think they do.
[02:45:22.863 --> 02:45:24.564]  I don't think they think about it.
[02:45:24.584 --> 02:45:25.465]  I think they feel about it.
[02:45:26.305 --> 02:45:28.206]  And they're just leaning into an energy and a vibe.
[02:45:28.546 --> 02:45:29.947]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[02:45:30.708 --> 02:45:34.210]  It's like when you see the zombies in San Francisco in like a catatonic state.
[02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:37.691]  They're just like, they're drooling and standing up and not moving because they're on so many drugs.
[02:45:37.751 --> 02:45:40.212]  Like, that's what the leftists are doing with politics.
[02:45:40.252 --> 02:45:41.673]  They're just leaning into this feeling.
[02:45:42.173 --> 02:45:44.414]  Looks like bad for them, but they can't stop doing it.
[02:45:44.434 --> 02:45:45.095]  It's weird.
[02:45:45.475 --> 02:45:48.376]  Let's show a little bit of that interview she did with Donald Trump.
[02:45:48.396 --> 02:45:49.677]  She seemed to like him back in the 90s.
[02:45:49.697 --> 02:45:54.419]  Go ahead and pull that up and we'll keep the DNC picture in picture so we can keep an eye on who's speaking next.
[02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:58.213]  You took out a full-page ad in major U.S.
[02:45:58.253 --> 02:46:00.433]  newspapers last year criticizing U.S.
[02:46:00.493 --> 02:46:01.074]  foreign policy.
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:02.874]  What would you do differently, Donald?
[02:46:02.954 --> 02:46:06.795]  I'd make our allies forget about the enemies, the enemies you can't talk to so easily.
[02:46:06.995 --> 02:46:08.976]  I'd make our allies pay their fair share.
[02:46:09.296 --> 02:46:10.196]  We're a debtor nation.
[02:46:10.476 --> 02:46:14.598]  Something's going to happen over the next number of years with this country, because you can't keep going on losing $200 billion.
[02:46:15.618 --> 02:46:19.801]  And yet we let Japan come in and dump everything right into our markets and everything.
[02:46:19.881 --> 02:46:20.661]  It's not free trade.
[02:46:21.061 --> 02:46:24.423]  If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, forget about it, Oprah.
[02:46:24.463 --> 02:46:25.244]  Just forget about it.
[02:46:25.284 --> 02:46:26.244]  It's almost impossible.
[02:46:26.464 --> 02:46:28.626]  They don't have laws against it, they just make it impossible.
[02:46:29.106 --> 02:46:33.028]  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our companies.
[02:46:33.448 --> 02:46:36.070]  And, hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people.
[02:46:36.270 --> 02:46:40.352]  I mean, you can respect somebody that's beaten the hell out of you, but they are beating the hell out of this country.
[02:46:40.893 --> 02:46:42.154]  Kuwait, they live like kings.
[02:46:42.194 --> 02:46:44.195]  The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings.
[02:46:44.795 --> 02:46:45.696]  And yet they're not paying.
[02:46:45.816 --> 02:46:47.977]  We make it possible for them to sell their oil.
[02:46:48.337 --> 02:46:50.898]  Why aren't they paying us 25% of what they're making?
[02:46:50.938 --> 02:46:51.539]  It's a joke.
[02:46:52.039 --> 02:46:55.001]  This sounds like political presidential talk to me.
[02:46:55.021 --> 02:46:57.122]  And I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run.
[02:46:57.182 --> 02:46:58.283]  Would you ever?
[02:46:58.303 --> 02:46:59.603]  She seems excited about the notion.
[02:46:59.643 --> 02:46:59.883]  Probably not.
[02:47:00.264 --> 02:47:02.685]  But I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off.
[02:47:02.705 --> 02:47:03.305]  Why would you not?
[02:47:03.766 --> 02:47:06.747]  I just don't think I really have the inclination to do it.
[02:47:06.787 --> 02:47:07.588]  I love what I'm doing.
[02:47:07.648 --> 02:47:08.528]  I really like it.
[02:47:08.768 --> 02:47:09.749]  Also, it doesn't pay as well.
[02:47:12.010 --> 02:47:14.592]  But, you know, I just probably wouldn't do it, Oprah.
[02:47:14.612 --> 02:47:28.343]  I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country, and if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country, how we're really making other people live like kings, and we're not.
[02:47:28.363 --> 02:47:30.004]  What do you think of this year's presidential race?
[02:47:30.084 --> 02:47:30.865]  You know what's amazing?
[02:47:30.885 --> 02:47:32.026]  Did I just cut you off?
[02:47:32.046 --> 02:47:33.026]  Sorry, I was listening to him.
[02:47:33.106 --> 02:47:33.607]  No, you're good.
[02:47:33.727 --> 02:47:34.948]  Go ahead.
[02:47:35.248 --> 02:47:37.330]  When you watched Biden 20 years ago,
[02:47:38.291 --> 02:47:42.795]  He's a totally different person in terms of his values, in terms of the things that he used to stand for.
[02:47:42.835 --> 02:47:45.977]  If you watch Trump 20 years ago, he's the same dude.
[02:47:46.417 --> 02:47:47.078]  Exactly the same dude.
[02:47:47.098 --> 02:47:48.199]  He's the same guy.
[02:47:48.579 --> 02:47:51.401]  Yeah, the Democratic Party is what changed, not Trump.
[02:47:52.002 --> 02:47:52.963]  The party went radical.
[02:47:53.003 --> 02:47:54.364]  I mean, he used to be a major Democrat.
[02:47:55.125 --> 02:47:56.026]  In a lot of ways, right?
[02:47:56.487 --> 02:48:05.982]  He always jokes that they loved me when I was giving money to them, but then the Democratic Party shifted so far left that the Elon Musks and the Donald Trumps of the world look like right-wing extremists now.
[02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:08.807]  They don't really look like right-wing extremists, but relative, yes.
[02:48:10.599 --> 02:48:18.929]  It's just fascinating because I'm seeing him talk and he's talking about America with the same passion back then that he is today, raising similar points.
[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:21.712]  The belief systems are there.
[02:48:21.792 --> 02:48:27.078]  If anything, he's become more passionate now, you know, about, I mean, he doesn't need to do this.
[02:48:27.478 --> 02:48:28.540]  He doesn't want to do this.
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:29.040]  He needs to.
[02:48:29.921 --> 02:48:34.206]  But, you know, you look at Biden, Biden was a flat out racist.
[02:48:34.806 --> 02:48:38.330]  Biden was fully against homosexual marriage.
[02:48:38.810 --> 02:48:39.651]  Yes, totally.
[02:48:39.731 --> 02:48:41.073]  And he wanted to cut Medicare.
[02:48:42.034 --> 02:48:43.515]  Totally flipped on all these things.
[02:48:43.555 --> 02:48:43.796]  Yes.
[02:48:43.956 --> 02:48:44.536]  Trump's the same.
[02:48:45.327 --> 02:48:51.635]  Yeah, well, it's hard to be in office for, like, 70 years straight and not flip-flop as culture and sentiments change.
[02:48:51.996 --> 02:48:53.618]  It just goes to show how willing they are to sell out.
[02:48:53.638 --> 02:48:57.864]  Didn't he give, like, a eulogy for KKK guy's funeral or something like that?
[02:48:57.904 --> 02:49:00.187]  He's definitely been photographed with the chief wizard.
[02:49:00.527 --> 02:49:12.591]  I saw, I heard him, and like, we'll find the clip later, I'm not asking the crew to do anything, but I heard him giving a fond eulogy to a, it appeared to be a KKK member or something to that effect of him speaking fondly about a person like that.
[02:49:12.911 --> 02:49:14.071]  Joe Biden is a scumbag.
[02:49:14.251 --> 02:49:15.532]  Joe Biden is a very bad man.
[02:49:15.592 --> 02:49:19.233]  Yeah, he didn't want his kids in a racial jungle, remember when it was integration?
[02:49:19.253 --> 02:49:19.593]  Oh yes.
[02:49:19.733 --> 02:49:20.053]  Yes.
[02:49:20.693 --> 02:49:25.975]  Joe Biden looks out for himself and, to his credit, a tiny bit his family.
[02:49:26.395 --> 02:49:32.436]  It seems a little bit, because the only reason why he's still in office is because he's fought to be able to pardon them before he leaves.
[02:49:32.476 --> 02:49:42.059]  Yes, but every instance of him looking out for his family has also been self-serving, because when you cover up for the terrible things that your family is doing, it's also protecting your own reputation.
[02:49:42.199 --> 02:49:42.379]  Right.
[02:49:42.459 --> 02:49:42.899]  That's true.
[02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:45.840]  And I feel that if you genuinely
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:50.402]  Correct me if I'm wrong, Crew, but didn't Biden marry Jill after his wife died in that car accident?
[02:49:50.422 --> 02:49:50.623]  Yeah.
[02:49:50.643 --> 02:49:51.843]  Wasn't she the nanny?
[02:49:51.863 --> 02:49:53.384]  His wife and daughter died and she was the nanny.
[02:49:53.444 --> 02:49:55.065]  Alright, so, not gonna say anymore.
[02:50:12.082 --> 02:50:12.502]  Yeah.
[02:50:13.003 --> 02:50:14.403]  And it was a mysterious car accident.
[02:50:14.443 --> 02:50:15.444]  They said it was a drunk driver.
[02:50:15.484 --> 02:50:16.224]  Turns out it wasn't.
[02:50:16.244 --> 02:50:18.266]  And they said that his wife actually ran a red light.
[02:50:18.766 --> 02:50:19.826]  She just gets slammed.
[02:50:19.866 --> 02:50:23.448]  There's audio of Richard Nixon that you can find.
[02:50:23.488 --> 02:50:26.990]  If you look through, maybe you can pull this up if you have enough capacity to do it.
[02:50:27.311 --> 02:50:30.853]  There's audio of Nixon hearing that Senator Joe Biden's
[02:50:31.653 --> 02:50:37.756]  ...wife died in the car accident and the phone call that he placed, Nixon placed, to Joe Biden saying that, you know, I'm sorry for the loss of your family.
[02:50:37.776 --> 02:50:39.096]  You can hear Joe Biden like, oh, well, thank you.
[02:50:39.136 --> 02:50:39.756]  We're real sad.
[02:50:39.796 --> 02:50:42.137]  And it's like, immediately starts banging the nanny.
[02:50:42.598 --> 02:50:45.179]  And, you know, let's just play devil's advocate for a second.
[02:50:46.044 --> 02:50:55.372]  It does make sense that if your wife dies and you have an attractive nanny who's been around, there's a trauma bond, your kids already love this person.
[02:50:55.773 --> 02:50:59.636]  It's like an immediate kind of substitution of the mother that's gone with another mother figure.
[02:51:00.077 --> 02:51:05.161]  There's an argument to be made that maybe that was like a natural thing that was like romantic or something that happened in the suffering.
[02:51:05.461 --> 02:51:09.385]  But when you look at everything else that Joe Biden's done, it looks like maybe he set up a death for himself.
[02:51:09.505 --> 02:51:09.946]  I don't know.
[02:51:25.961 --> 02:51:33.964]  The estimate is like at least 500,000 civilians died in the wars between Afghanistan and Iraq in the United States over the course of 20 years, wars that Joe Biden voted for.
[02:51:34.364 --> 02:51:40.487]  So yes, his votes have resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of innocent people, not even counting the vaccine mandates and stuff.
[02:51:40.627 --> 02:51:41.427]  Unbelievable.
[02:51:41.707 --> 02:51:45.090]  Yeah, I mean it's like, it's Mao-level stuff, it's Hitler-level stuff.
[02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:49.494]  People complain about 6 million Jews dying in the Holocaust plus the other 5 million people that died in the Holocaust.
[02:51:49.514 --> 02:51:52.376]  There's actually 11 million people supposedly that died in the Holocaust.
[02:51:52.476 --> 02:51:54.998]  It's not just something that happened to the Jews, it happened to other people too.
[02:51:55.399 --> 02:52:04.326]  But between Joe Biden and some of these other leftist leaders and bad policy and Bill Gates' decision to put poison on fishnets and things like that, there's millions more that have died.
[02:52:04.366 --> 02:52:10.453]  Well, in Nazi Germany, they would kill people if they considered to be, like, invalids or mentally defunct.
[02:52:10.573 --> 02:52:12.636]  Now, we elect those people to office.
[02:52:13.857 --> 02:52:14.498]  That's what we do.
[02:52:14.558 --> 02:52:15.959]  So you're saying the Nazis were right?
[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:17.401]  Well, I'm just saying they were different.
[02:52:17.421 --> 02:52:20.304]  They were a different flavor of crazy than we are now, but we're approaching that, man.
[02:52:20.344 --> 02:52:21.005]  It's pretty bad.
[02:52:21.185 --> 02:52:21.746]  It's pretty bad.
[02:52:21.766 --> 02:52:23.148]  They spy on you whenever they want.
[02:52:23.168 --> 02:52:24.089]  They rob you blind.
[02:52:24.409 --> 02:52:25.370]  They treat you like crap.
[02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:27.891]  They let people in illegally and give them more rights than you.
[02:52:27.911 --> 02:52:36.715]  And then they put on this show pretending like it's someone else's fault and they're gonna fix it even though that's the current... They're administering all the problems they're claiming they're going to fix.
[02:52:36.755 --> 02:52:40.077]  The Democratic Party is the current party in power.
[02:52:40.117 --> 02:52:40.337]  Right.
[02:52:40.897 --> 02:52:43.798]  The president comes from the Democratic Party.
[02:52:44.679 --> 02:52:46.440]  Kamala Harris was the border czar.
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:48.701]  These people...
[02:52:49.468 --> 02:52:50.169]  They are retarded.
[02:52:51.009 --> 02:52:52.050]  It's like idiocracy.
[02:52:52.110 --> 02:52:53.852]  It's really like idiocracy.
[02:52:53.872 --> 02:52:56.114]  But at least the people in idiocracy were good people.
[02:52:56.154 --> 02:52:56.934]  They were just retarded.
[02:52:56.974 --> 02:52:58.376]  You know, why come you don't have a tattoo?
[02:52:58.436 --> 02:52:59.176]  Oh, you poor retard.
[02:52:59.356 --> 02:53:00.878]  These people are also evil and retarded.
[02:53:01.618 --> 02:53:03.000]  We do have that audio of that Nixon call.
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:04.941]  Let's go ahead and play that just for the sake of posterity.
[02:53:07.503 --> 02:53:08.144]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:53:08.224 --> 02:53:08.945]  How are you?
[02:53:10.106 --> 02:53:15.030]  Senator, I know this is a very tragic day for you, but I wanted you to know that all of us here
[02:53:15.962 --> 02:53:23.866]  At the White House we're thinking about you and praying for you and also for your two children.
[02:53:26.247 --> 02:53:35.111]  We know that I understand you were on the hill at the time and your wife was just driving by herself.
[02:53:35.131 --> 02:53:45.616]  In any event, looking at it as you must in terms of the future because you have the great fortune of being young.
[02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:49.225]  I remember I was two years older than you when I went to the house.
[02:53:50.065 --> 02:54:00.637]  But the main part is you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory and you enjoyed it together and now I'm sure that she'll be watching you from now on.
[02:54:00.997 --> 02:54:01.618]  Good luck to you.
[02:54:01.858 --> 02:54:03.600]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[02:54:06.397 --> 02:54:06.817]  That's it.
[02:54:06.857 --> 02:54:07.318]  That's a wrap.
[02:54:07.358 --> 02:54:08.718]  Isn't that just- That is kind of sus.
[02:54:09.359 --> 02:54:10.419]  Thank you, Mitch.
[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:12.080]  Was that publicized?
[02:54:12.521 --> 02:54:13.161]  I don't think so.
[02:54:13.181 --> 02:54:15.262]  I think he came out with the tapes after Watergate and stuff.
[02:54:15.763 --> 02:54:17.224]  He just recorded all of his calls.
[02:54:17.604 --> 02:54:17.824]  Wow.
[02:54:17.864 --> 02:54:20.906]  And so it just came out when all the tapes came out of everything they had.
[02:54:20.926 --> 02:54:25.809]  They're like, oh wow, this is when he called Joe Biden to say, sorry, your wife's dead, but you're so young, so bang the nanny.
[02:54:27.572 --> 02:54:28.793]  It's got any implication, right?
[02:54:29.013 --> 02:54:31.754]  You're still very young, so you could marry again, young man.
[02:54:31.794 --> 02:54:35.315]  Nixon doesn't sound too depressed, either.
[02:54:35.695 --> 02:54:37.576]  No, he was just being polite.
[02:54:37.896 --> 02:54:40.177]  And nobody really cares when somebody else dies.
[02:54:40.237 --> 02:54:46.760]  At least these people.
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:48.401]  It's Petey.
[02:54:48.561 --> 02:54:48.981]  It's Petey.
[02:54:49.001 --> 02:54:49.581]  Let's throw it up.
[02:54:49.601 --> 02:54:51.202]  Let's throw up Mayor Booty Juice.
[02:54:51.222 --> 02:54:55.084]  I don't think he's really gay.
[02:54:55.104 --> 02:54:55.864]  I think he's faking it.
[02:55:00.138 --> 02:55:03.799]  Here's a sentence I never thought I'd hear myself saying.
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:09.181]  I'm Pete Buttigieg, and you might recognize me from Fox News.
[02:55:14.263 --> 02:55:15.143]  Look at him, they love it.
[02:55:16.023 --> 02:55:17.964]  I believe in going anywhere.
[02:55:18.903 --> 02:55:19.263]  Anywhere.
[02:55:19.483 --> 02:55:20.124]  Yeah, I bet you do.
[02:55:20.224 --> 02:55:31.251]  In service of a good cause, and friends, we gather in a very good cause, electing Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for the next president and vice president of the United States.
[02:55:36.435 --> 02:55:37.936]  The choice could not be clearer.
[02:55:39.397 --> 02:55:45.941]  Donald Trump rants about law and order, as if he wasn't a convicted criminal running against a prosecutor.
[02:55:47.785 --> 02:55:51.409]  As if we were gonna forget that crime was higher on his watch.
[02:55:53.732 --> 02:55:55.874]  Talks about the forgotten man.
[02:55:56.915 --> 02:56:03.443]  Hoping we'll forget that the only economic promise that he actually kept was to cut taxes for the rich.
[02:56:05.529 --> 02:56:06.450]  Listening to John Legend.
[02:56:06.631 --> 02:56:08.033]  It's just been my constant reaction.
[02:56:08.073 --> 02:56:08.594]  It's hard.
[02:56:08.694 --> 02:56:09.575]  It's a hard watch chase.
[02:56:09.595 --> 02:56:13.000]  But you have to look the enemy in the eye.
[02:56:13.061 --> 02:56:13.601]  You do.
[02:56:20.672 --> 02:56:21.932]  You have to study them and pay attention.
[02:56:21.952 --> 02:56:22.073]  You do.
[02:56:22.113 --> 02:56:22.893]  Nobody wants to see it.
[02:56:22.913 --> 02:56:23.013]  J.D.
[02:56:23.053 --> 02:56:27.054]  Vance is one of those guys who thinks if you don't live the life that he has in mind for you, then you don't count.
[02:56:27.074 --> 02:56:30.075]  Especially since it's so obvious what they're doing because we have historical context.
[02:56:30.095 --> 02:56:34.537]  Like, when a lot of this stuff happened the first time in the 20th century, it was literally the first time it happened.
[02:56:34.577 --> 02:56:35.997]  Like, the Nazis did the Nazi thing.
[02:56:36.017 --> 02:56:37.898]  Nobody ever really done anything like that before.
[02:56:37.958 --> 02:56:39.779]  When the commies did the commie thing.
[02:56:39.799 --> 02:56:40.559]  Nobody ever really done...
[02:56:40.799 --> 02:56:42.700]  Like, Gulags and Soviet stuff before.
[02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:47.942]  Now we have these examples and the historical record of the rhetoric that led up to it.
[02:56:48.302 --> 02:56:54.144]  And when you see it happen again, it's like, it's the old expression, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
[02:56:54.224 --> 02:56:54.504]  Right.
[02:56:54.544 --> 02:56:58.886]  It's like, shame on us for not seeing how, like, as a people, not seeing what this is.
[02:56:58.926 --> 02:57:01.107]  This leads to death and destruction.
[02:57:03.248 --> 02:57:05.788]  The problem is people have a really short memory to chase.
[02:57:06.049 --> 02:57:06.269]  Yeah.
[02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:07.789]  Like... Wait, what'd you say?
[02:57:07.809 --> 02:57:09.550]  I'm just kidding.
[02:57:11.437 --> 02:57:13.058]  That went over my head for a moment.
[02:57:13.078 --> 02:57:16.341]  Sorry, it was not going to be a joke.
[02:57:16.361 --> 02:57:19.764]  But you know, I don't like to relive COVID all the time.
[02:57:19.784 --> 02:57:19.864]  Yeah.
[02:57:20.005 --> 02:57:22.046]  But we cannot forget.
[02:57:22.066 --> 02:57:22.867]  We can never forget.
[02:57:22.887 --> 02:57:22.947]  Yes.
[02:57:22.967 --> 02:57:23.708]  Exactly.
[02:57:23.888 --> 02:57:24.929]  Like, from Australia.
[02:57:27.472 --> 02:57:28.333]  Yeah, it was really bad.
[02:57:28.353 --> 02:57:31.214]  There were people escaping quarantine camps in Australia.
[02:57:31.234 --> 02:57:34.897]  The military came and took them by force to camps.
[02:57:34.957 --> 02:57:36.398]  They weren't even sick.
[02:57:36.558 --> 02:57:38.019]  They did not even test positive.
[02:57:38.259 --> 02:57:39.660]  They were close contacts.
[02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:44.863]  Then they escaped and there was a national manhunt aired on television.
[02:57:45.103 --> 02:57:45.603]  Wow.
[02:57:45.764 --> 02:57:47.184]  What happened to them when they found them?
[02:57:47.885 --> 02:57:48.926]  Put them back in.
[02:57:49.126 --> 02:57:50.947]  Then it all went very, very harsh.
[02:57:51.567 --> 02:57:55.690]  I wonder if they got criminally charged for illegally leaving a camp and maybe they're in prison now.
[02:57:56.138 --> 02:57:58.659]  They were Aboriginal people from a remote community.
[02:57:58.679 --> 02:57:59.399]  Oh, then who cares?
[02:58:00.580 --> 02:58:01.861]  That's the mentality, right?
[02:58:02.001 --> 02:58:02.541]  Absolutely.
[02:58:02.581 --> 02:58:08.464]  They were injecting these people under trees next to piles of rubbish outdoors with no gloves on.
[02:58:08.484 --> 02:58:11.485]  This is how much the government cares about Aboriginal people.
[02:58:12.045 --> 02:58:12.725]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:13.386 --> 02:58:20.849]  Let's show that clip of Tucker Carlson saying his insider says that Pete Buttigieg isn't really gay, and then let's cut back to Pete and see what the audience thinks.
[02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:24.631]  Do you remember Pete Buttigieg ran for president?
[02:58:25.828 --> 02:58:29.712]  He's supposedly gay and now he's transportation secretary.
[02:58:29.992 --> 02:58:33.336]  And I had a, one of my producers was gay and he goes, you know, he's not gay.
[02:58:34.077 --> 02:58:35.018]  I was like, are you serious?
[02:58:35.378 --> 02:58:36.679]  He goes, no, that's complete bullshit.
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:37.220]  Wow.
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:37.761]  Oh no.
[02:58:37.801 --> 02:58:41.785]  He goes, and you know, they all, gays all keep very close track of that stuff.
[02:58:42.085 --> 02:58:44.287]  And my producer's like, no, that's, that's, it's totally opposed.
[02:58:44.728 --> 02:58:45.889]  He was dating a woman just a few years ago.
[02:58:45.929 --> 02:58:46.750]  That's totally fake.
[02:58:46.810 --> 02:58:47.551]  He's not gay at all.
[02:58:47.771 --> 02:58:47.971]  Smart.
[02:58:48.872 --> 02:58:50.554]  So I said that on the air, people got all offended.
[02:58:50.575 --> 02:58:52.557]  I thought it was kind of hilarious.
[02:58:52.597 --> 02:58:53.258]  It is hilarious.
[02:58:53.278 --> 02:58:53.599]  Yeah, it is.
[02:58:53.659 --> 02:58:54.219]  It is hilarious.
[02:58:54.279 --> 02:58:54.500]  Yes.
[02:58:54.820 --> 02:58:56.342]  And you're also like, I'm not against gays.
[02:58:56.422 --> 02:58:57.344]  I'm saying he's not one.
[02:58:58.465 --> 02:58:59.426]  Well, that's what I said!
[02:59:02.591 --> 02:59:03.492]  Isn't that fascinating?
[02:59:05.698 --> 02:59:06.138]  No.
[02:59:06.238 --> 02:59:08.499]  He comes off weak to me, but that's not the same thing.
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:12.021]  So is it, what, he's pretend gay for DEI?
[02:59:12.381 --> 02:59:15.743]  Obviously it's worked out really well for him as far as his political career.
[02:59:15.783 --> 02:59:24.007]  He was nobody, he was a mayor with a net worth of $100,000, didn't do a particularly good job as mayor, got gay married, ran for president, and now he's transportation secretary?
[02:59:24.227 --> 02:59:24.967]  Wow.
[02:59:24.987 --> 02:59:26.188]  I don't think he's gay.
[02:59:28.092 --> 02:59:33.993]  I think he's adopted a kid with a gay man who he married and they probably have an open marriage.
[02:59:34.513 --> 02:59:35.654]  That is so twisted.
[02:59:35.814 --> 02:59:37.034]  Yeah, I don't know if it's true.
[02:59:37.394 --> 02:59:38.674]  Obviously it's speculation.
[02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:43.375]  Maybe the guy's gay and everybody's just wrong about it, but he does not come off as gay to me.
[02:59:43.395 --> 02:59:43.795]  He doesn't.
[02:59:43.955 --> 02:59:44.516]  Weak, yes.
[02:59:45.976 --> 02:59:49.857]  Yeah, he just comes off like the kid that won the science fair because he cheated.
[02:59:51.617 --> 02:59:55.478]  You know, like he kind of knew science because he's dorky, you know, but he's also like a cheat.
[02:59:57.010 --> 02:59:59.972]  That's a perfect description.
[02:59:59.992 --> 03:00:05.495]  You know, like he did a whole science project on climate change and it was all bad data, and he won because it was about climate change.
[03:00:05.815 --> 03:00:08.937]  He's also not really gay, but he won because he's gay.
[03:00:09.097 --> 03:00:13.000]  It's like what he's been doing his whole life, science fairs and gay flares.
[03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:18.083]  And yet the makeup of our kitchen table, the existence of my family,
[03:00:18.874 --> 03:00:28.582]  It's just one example of something that was literally impossible as recently as 25 years ago when an anxious teenager growing up in Indiana...
[03:00:33.772 --> 03:00:36.033]  He's like, he doesn't want to do the kiss.
[03:00:36.113 --> 03:00:36.514]  Pull it up.
[03:00:36.614 --> 03:00:36.934]  Pull it up.
[03:00:36.954 --> 03:00:37.995]  He doesn't want to do the kiss.
[03:00:38.075 --> 03:00:39.236]  Like, he's like, I'm not really gay.
[03:00:39.296 --> 03:00:40.276]  I'm not really gay.
[03:00:40.536 --> 03:00:41.657]  The guy's kissing him is gay.
[03:00:41.697 --> 03:00:43.278]  Like, hell yeah, I'm going to get a straight guy.
[03:00:43.779 --> 03:00:45.220]  But he's like, look, he's holding his hand out.
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:47.641]  Like, I don't even want to hold you while this happens.
[03:00:47.701 --> 03:00:55.207]  Like, he's like, oh, you know, like, like when you watch Brokeback Mountain and like, they're not really gay.
[03:00:55.227 --> 03:00:57.048]  That's what that was.
[03:00:57.428 --> 03:00:58.429]  They're acting right.
[03:01:01.031 --> 03:01:02.072]  Did he really adopt a kid?
[03:01:02.092 --> 03:01:03.553]  I think they have an adopted kid, yeah.
[03:01:03.614 --> 03:01:05.675]  I don't know if it was an IBS with a surrogate thing.
[03:01:05.695 --> 03:01:06.356]  Yeah, he's not gay, look.
[03:01:06.416 --> 03:01:09.079]  I tell you what, I could record this speech, me speaking it.
[03:01:20.646 --> 03:01:21.827]  Yeah, he doesn't talk like a gay guy, does he?
[03:01:38.174 --> 03:01:43.616]  No, and there are some gay men that don't talk like gay men, but they come off gay for other reasons.
[03:01:43.896 --> 03:01:44.256]  Yes.
[03:01:44.296 --> 03:01:44.516]  Right?
[03:01:44.576 --> 03:01:49.057]  So they might not have a list, but maybe you can just kind of tell by their attire.
[03:01:49.077 --> 03:01:49.737]  They're fruity.
[03:01:49.777 --> 03:01:50.998]  Yeah, that's a good way to put it, you know?
[03:01:51.098 --> 03:01:53.838]  I'm not trying to have a negative connotation here, but yeah, they're facts.
[03:01:53.858 --> 03:02:03.141]  But the thing is, he doesn't display anything that seems gay other than the pictures of him kissing his husband in a cringe way.
[03:02:03.161 --> 03:02:03.841]  Yes.
[03:02:04.541 --> 03:02:05.302]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:02:05.342 --> 03:02:06.542]  Even the way he holds himself.
[03:02:07.364 --> 03:02:08.409]  Yeah, he's just a dork.
[03:02:13.115 --> 03:02:23.437]  I will say it was pretty gay when he was riding his bicycle to work as the Secretary of Transportation.
[03:02:23.477 --> 03:02:25.237]  Do you remember that?
[03:02:25.258 --> 03:02:27.498]  A couple years ago.
[03:02:27.558 --> 03:02:28.858]  Right, so it's the gay thing!
[03:02:28.898 --> 03:02:30.439]  Yeah, he put his helmet on.
[03:02:30.459 --> 03:02:31.499]  Who wears a helmet?
[03:02:31.559 --> 03:02:33.619]  First of all, don't wear a helmet.
[03:02:38.749 --> 03:02:39.429]  Take a little risk.
[03:02:39.770 --> 03:02:42.231]  He probably flies a private helicopter to work.
[03:02:42.251 --> 03:02:45.132]  Let's be serious.
[03:02:45.953 --> 03:02:47.073]  See, that guy on the right is gay.
[03:02:47.714 --> 03:02:48.894]  I can tell just by the picture.
[03:02:49.094 --> 03:02:49.435]  Yeah.
[03:02:50.455 --> 03:02:51.156]  He's floppy.
[03:02:52.016 --> 03:02:54.517]  And they might love each other in some, you know, fraternal way.
[03:02:54.537 --> 03:02:57.299]  They might be companions, but I don't think they're... I don't think he's hitting it.
[03:03:00.084 --> 03:03:00.484]  I don't know.
[03:03:01.485 --> 03:03:01.885]  I don't know.
[03:03:02.585 --> 03:03:02.746]  Oh!
[03:03:03.446 --> 03:03:04.006]  Veterans!
[03:03:04.867 --> 03:03:07.408]  Veterans who aren't offended about the stolen ballot thing?
[03:03:07.648 --> 03:03:08.549]  Yeah, oh my god.
[03:03:08.569 --> 03:03:11.490]  That's why they have to bring this in, isn't it?
[03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.991]  Let's hear it.
[03:03:12.051 --> 03:03:13.672]  Is that a picture of walls and a helmet?
[03:03:15.313 --> 03:03:19.275]  Not in a war zone?
[03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:22.317]  Did you see the guy that I had on that called in, Shad?
[03:03:22.917 --> 03:03:23.858]  I should put you in touch with him.
[03:03:24.138 --> 03:03:26.940]  He called into the show when we were hosting the Sunday Night Live show a couple of weeks ago.
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:29.381]  Spoke to him for 23 minutes, he called in again this week.
[03:03:29.421 --> 03:03:32.283]  He went to China with Walls in 1995.
[03:03:32.523 --> 03:03:36.305]  He was a student that was going over there and Walls was like in a teacher position.
[03:03:37.566 --> 03:03:39.868]  And he was telling stories about Tim Walz in China.
[03:03:39.888 --> 03:03:41.729]  He's like, look, this guy, he's a sweet man.
[03:03:41.749 --> 03:03:42.689]  That's basically what he said.
[03:03:42.909 --> 03:03:43.089]  Right.
[03:03:43.109 --> 03:03:44.811]  But he's a Maoist to the core.
[03:03:44.851 --> 03:03:49.153]  He was purchasing and collecting dozens of little red books, which is the Maoist propaganda book.
[03:03:49.173 --> 03:03:50.434]  I heard you talking about this.
[03:03:50.774 --> 03:03:51.254]  Right?
[03:03:51.374 --> 03:03:58.619]  And there was an incident at Tiananmen Square where the caller mentioned something about Tank Man and Tim Walz really chided him for bringing that up in front of the Chinese, you know?
[03:03:59.199 --> 03:04:09.315]  And there was another incident where the People's Liberation Army, like three soldiers, were beating the hell out of a cripple who was begging for money because it embarrassed China that a cripple was begging for money while Americans were there.
[03:04:10.076 --> 03:04:14.663]  And Tim Walz interfered and didn't let any of the students stop the cops from beating the hell out of the guy.
[03:04:15.243 --> 03:04:37.478]  The guy is like 100, they had like political debates and he told stories about singing karaoke with them and you know they were like buddies who completely disagreed politically but you know college buddies you might have a buddy who's a leftist and you might be a capitalist and you might debate about Ayn Rand and have a beer and you know smoke a cigarette whatever right and that happened to me all the time in college with buddies that were comedies and we would just you know argue until three in the morning it's a blast as you're growing up and you're learning
[03:04:38.198 --> 03:04:40.339]  Back when you could completely disagree.
[03:04:40.399 --> 03:04:42.120]  Right, and it was cool.
[03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:48.182]  And he's like, I saw Tim Walz run for Congress in I think 2006 and I thought, oh boy, this is bad.
[03:04:48.503 --> 03:04:51.524]  Because you don't think your buddy's ever going to run for Congress.
[03:04:51.544 --> 03:04:53.505]  That's part of the reason why it's okay to disagree.
[03:04:54.105 --> 03:04:55.726]  No, no, he's a Maoist.
[03:04:56.326 --> 03:04:57.727]  And the evidence is just overwhelming.
[03:04:57.747 --> 03:05:01.148]  I think Calmer's now launching an investigation into his connection with the CCP.
[03:05:02.409 --> 03:05:06.771]  Now, John Legend, to me, comes off more homosexual than Pete Buttigieg.
[03:05:06.951 --> 03:05:07.471]  For sure.
[03:05:09.252 --> 03:05:10.674]  But he pretends to be straight, right?
[03:05:11.175 --> 03:05:11.656]  I don't know.
[03:05:12.016 --> 03:05:12.717]  He's probably both.
[03:05:12.937 --> 03:05:15.581]  Didn't he have, like, a sex addiction that he went to rehab for?
[03:05:15.822 --> 03:05:18.606]  Or am I thinking of... I'm thinking of Usher, maybe.
[03:05:18.626 --> 03:05:20.568]  I don't know.
[03:05:20.588 --> 03:05:22.011]  Why do all these people such freaks?
[03:05:22.031 --> 03:05:22.712]  I don't know.
[03:05:24.105 --> 03:05:33.569]  I guess when, like, every other problem goes away, because you have so much money and so many resources and so much fame, then, like, the only thing to do is, like, dive into the abyss.
[03:05:34.689 --> 03:05:37.330]  I think it's more to do with what you have to do in order to be famous.
[03:05:37.470 --> 03:05:38.010]  You think so?
[03:05:38.371 --> 03:05:38.611]  Yeah.
[03:05:38.651 --> 03:05:41.772]  You think that you have to get on your knees to make it in that business?
[03:05:42.092 --> 03:05:42.292]  You do.
[03:05:42.312 --> 03:05:43.933]  These are just all compromised people.
[03:05:44.113 --> 03:05:44.333]  You do.
[03:05:45.473 --> 03:05:49.516]  And these days especially, like you see how they all just go overtly satanic.
[03:05:49.536 --> 03:05:49.636]  Yeah.
[03:05:50.056 --> 03:05:51.037]  You know, like Sam Smith.
[03:05:51.397 --> 03:05:52.338]  Yeah, they rub it in your face.
[03:05:52.678 --> 03:05:57.181]  I mean, even Stoop Dogg, who's somebody I typically like when I see in interviews, is wearing like a Baphomet necklace.
[03:05:58.102 --> 03:06:00.443]  Literally the goat with the, you know, the evil horns.
[03:06:00.603 --> 03:06:01.044]  Yeah.
[03:06:01.104 --> 03:06:01.964]  Why are you doing that?
[03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:02.925]  Are you just trying to be edgy?
[03:06:04.026 --> 03:06:05.707]  No, I don't think that it's about that.
[03:06:07.188 --> 03:06:11.571]  And so I think that that essentially sends them into just more and more depravity.
[03:06:12.031 --> 03:06:12.252]  Yeah.
[03:06:12.732 --> 03:06:20.457]  Because if you're willing to compromise that about yourself in order to get ahead for a career, then what else are you willing to do in order to avoid conflict or excel?
[03:06:21.178 --> 03:06:23.619]  Yeah, but it eats away at your soul.
[03:06:23.679 --> 03:06:24.380]  It has to.
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:25.020]  Right, of course.
[03:06:25.561 --> 03:06:25.981]  Of course.
[03:06:26.621 --> 03:06:31.525]  I mean, if you're not even loyal to yourself, then how could you maintain your soul?
[03:06:31.545 --> 03:06:32.986]  Your soul requires some tending.
[03:06:33.486 --> 03:06:34.607]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06:37.691 --> 03:06:38.671]  What do you think of this performance?
[03:06:40.572 --> 03:06:43.552]  Um, I'm really unimpressed in general.
[03:06:47.093 --> 03:06:48.513]  They just have to bring the celebrities too.
[03:06:48.533 --> 03:06:55.575]  And it's funny because usually the celebrity performs at the beginning of the show to draw the crowd, right?
[03:06:55.635 --> 03:06:55.855]  Yeah.
[03:06:56.075 --> 03:06:58.075]  And then they pray that people stay when they speak.
[03:06:58.576 --> 03:07:02.476]  But now they figured out that people leaving is a problem, so you have to put the celebrity at the end of the night.
[03:07:03.377 --> 03:07:04.897]  So people stay through the whole thing.
[03:07:07.802 --> 03:07:11.745]  I mean, there's... The energy in the crowd's not that much anymore.
[03:07:11.805 --> 03:07:12.405]  It is late.
[03:07:12.845 --> 03:07:13.426]  It is late.
[03:07:13.966 --> 03:07:19.370]  Look, if you're going to fly in every radical leftist from anywhere and pay them to be there, you're going to fill a stadium.
[03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:21.832]  It's not impressive to me that that room is full.
[03:07:25.034 --> 03:07:25.254]  No.
[03:07:25.734 --> 03:07:25.914]  No.
[03:07:28.376 --> 03:07:34.720]  Oh, that lady was digging it.
[03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:35.641]  Did you think about going?
[03:07:35.681 --> 03:07:36.962]  Did you think about going in person this year?
[03:07:38.135 --> 03:07:38.917]  The DNC.
[03:07:38.937 --> 03:07:39.338]  To get it?
[03:07:39.398 --> 03:07:40.440]  Yeah, to like, get the story?
[03:07:41.602 --> 03:07:43.465]  Um... No.
[03:07:44.748 --> 03:07:45.369]  Not worth it.
[03:07:46.431 --> 03:07:46.671]  No.
[03:07:46.691 --> 03:07:48.334]  This all does require tending.
[03:07:50.299 --> 03:07:54.080]  Well, I'm really glad you're here with me tonight because it would've been awfully lonely to have to deal with this by myself.
[03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:55.921]  Oh, it's been really good, Chase.
[03:07:55.961 --> 03:08:03.623]  I mean, you know, as you said earlier, and I've watched it all week because you have to know your enemy.
[03:08:03.843 --> 03:08:04.884]  Yeah.
[03:08:04.924 --> 03:08:07.104]  Even Alex, though, this morning was like, I'm not coming tonight.
[03:08:07.264 --> 03:08:08.145]  I'll be here.
[03:08:08.225 --> 03:08:09.345]  I can't do it another night.
[03:08:10.305 --> 03:08:10.886]  It's hard.
[03:08:10.926 --> 03:08:11.286]  It's a hard watch.
[03:08:11.306 --> 03:08:13.386]  It's like watching a Disney version of a Star Wars movie.
[03:08:13.727 --> 03:08:14.867]  And it's not even, you know...
[03:08:16.872 --> 03:08:21.037]  They're not being, they're not being as out in the open evil as they usually are.
[03:08:21.537 --> 03:08:30.687]  They've really, like I said- You mean like, they're not really like just like, how would you, how would that look if they were being out in the evil, out in the open evil?
[03:08:32.461 --> 03:08:37.145]  Like, talking a lot about transgenderism and, like, puberty blockers, maybe.
[03:08:37.285 --> 03:08:43.151]  Yeah, and more, you know, the ways in which they're painting communism is very fluffy.
[03:08:43.171 --> 03:08:43.731]  Yes.
[03:08:44.212 --> 03:08:48.075]  As opposed to, say, for example, Joe Biden coming with his red, you know, background.
[03:08:48.095 --> 03:08:50.557]  Yeah, and coming out and talking about prosecuting Trump supporters.
[03:08:50.597 --> 03:08:51.758]  They could have done a little bit more of that.
[03:08:51.938 --> 03:08:52.659]  That's what I mean.
[03:08:52.679 --> 03:08:53.640]  They're walking that back.
[03:08:53.860 --> 03:08:54.440]  They are.
[03:08:55.021 --> 03:08:55.421]  They are.
[03:08:55.461 --> 03:09:02.925]  But they're not actually going to walk it back in terms of what they do, they're just walking it back in terms of the rhetoric because they don't want to scare away the prey before they have a chance to release the arrow.
[03:09:03.346 --> 03:09:09.529]  Well, you know, I was speaking with a liberal guy recently here in Austin.
[03:09:10.470 --> 03:09:11.490]  How'd you find one?
[03:09:13.632 --> 03:09:14.652]  A cigar lounge.
[03:09:14.852 --> 03:09:15.053]  Yeah.
[03:09:15.953 --> 03:09:16.373]  Oh yeah?
[03:09:17.014 --> 03:09:18.334]  Yeah.
[03:09:18.354 --> 03:09:19.115]  The one on Congress?
[03:09:19.255 --> 03:09:20.436]  With the water tower outside?
[03:09:20.456 --> 03:09:21.136]  I won't say which one.
[03:09:22.921 --> 03:09:31.332]  But, um, but I was speaking with him and, you know, he was like, oh, yeah, we should definitely fine people for not getting vaccinated.
[03:09:31.472 --> 03:09:35.698]  But, you know, sending the military onto them is is really extreme.
[03:09:36.038 --> 03:09:37.000]  Like that's that is.
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:38.562]  But the fine is also egregious.
[03:09:38.582 --> 03:09:38.822]  Yeah.
[03:09:38.842 --> 03:09:40.124]  The fining is also egregious.
[03:09:40.144 --> 03:09:40.244]  But.
[03:09:40.464 --> 03:09:42.005]  But there was a line that he had to.
[03:09:42.145 --> 03:09:42.625]  That's right.
[03:09:43.086 --> 03:10:02.738]  And so when I when I sort of warned him about that and warned him about where some of these types of, you know, ideas can lead to like they have in Australia in the past, the ideas of someone like the Democratic Party, you know, he he was kind of willing to consider that.
[03:10:03.478 --> 03:10:09.242]  And, you know, he agreed that the First Amendment and the Second Amendment and protecting the Constitution actually matter.
[03:10:09.522 --> 03:10:10.343]  Yeah.
[03:10:10.663 --> 03:10:13.005]  And you probably weren't coming off in an aggressive way.
[03:10:13.565 --> 03:10:17.829]  No, I love talking to people from a different viewpoint.
[03:10:18.069 --> 03:10:19.670]  I used to be a case manager.
[03:10:19.711 --> 03:10:25.575]  So, you know, it's like, I like doing this and sort of breaking down worldviews and challenging them.
[03:10:27.417 --> 03:10:33.362]  And anyway, my point is, this DNC watching this wouldn't scare him away.
[03:10:33.942 --> 03:10:34.122]  Right.
[03:10:34.142 --> 03:10:35.604]  But if they went really hard again,
[03:10:36.075 --> 03:10:37.316]  It might push the independents away.
[03:10:37.516 --> 03:10:37.897]  Yes.
[03:10:37.917 --> 03:10:38.937]  That makes sense.
[03:10:39.438 --> 03:10:41.800]  By the way, look at Amy Klobuchar up there.
[03:10:42.460 --> 03:10:43.321]  Let's listen to her voice.
[03:10:43.501 --> 03:10:46.083]  Chicken dinner when their son was born.
[03:10:47.985 --> 03:10:49.306]  That's what we do in America.
[03:10:49.826 --> 03:10:53.149]  They always start with a story about a family dinner.
[03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:56.612]  At least half of the speakers it seems like have done this.
[03:10:57.392 --> 03:10:59.114]  On the farm and in the factory.
[03:10:59.915 --> 03:11:00.315]  We're good.
[03:11:20.848 --> 03:11:31.877]  But it's just funny because imagine if this democratic plan to bring back manufacturing to the United States really worked and we started making everything here instead of importing it from China.
[03:11:31.897 --> 03:11:36.661]  Do you think anybody on the left would actually want to work in a factory online?
[03:11:36.921 --> 03:11:37.141]  No.
[03:11:37.741 --> 03:11:40.764]  Like, they're excited about factory jobs for somebody else.
[03:11:41.118 --> 03:11:41.738]  Oh, but not me, right?
[03:11:41.838 --> 03:11:43.620]  I don't have to work in the factory, right?
[03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:45.161]  I get a cubicle or an office, right?
[03:11:45.181 --> 03:11:48.443]  And I can be in the HR department, right?
[03:11:49.443 --> 03:11:51.705]  Their vision for America is everybody working in a factory.
[03:11:51.725 --> 03:11:53.386]  It sounds very Maoist, actually.
[03:11:53.406 --> 03:11:55.688]  The Great Leap Forward was the same thing, you know?
[03:11:57.252 --> 03:11:58.974]  This is never going to happen, Chase.
[03:11:59.054 --> 03:12:01.276]  They have zero plans to do this.
[03:12:01.316 --> 03:12:02.577]  Yes, you're right.
[03:12:02.717 --> 03:12:12.945]  Because the Democratic Party is fully aligned with the AI World Society agenda, where everyone's sort of offered a UBI and we can all just sit at home and build them out of us.
[03:12:15.207 --> 03:12:15.927]  That's what they want.
[03:12:15.947 --> 03:12:19.310]  Why do they all have the same haircut?
[03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:20.150]  They do!
[03:12:20.230 --> 03:12:20.391]  Right?
[03:12:20.411 --> 03:12:21.712]  It's like Nancy Pelosi's haircut.
[03:12:21.732 --> 03:12:23.713]  And Fingertish's wife's haircut.
[03:12:27.042 --> 03:12:29.142]  At least she's not wearing pearls.
[03:12:30.563 --> 03:12:37.184]  She's wearing some sort of... Are they black pearls?
[03:12:37.264 --> 03:12:39.124]  Maybe.
[03:12:40.065 --> 03:12:46.566]  Way up north in Minnesota, out of Lake Itasca, flows the Mississippi River.
[03:12:46.606 --> 03:12:51.347]  Out of Lake Itasca, you can find Barack Obama's chef, dead.
[03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:56.008]  Washed up, right next to Clinton's chef, dead, washed up.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:02.922]  And if you're drowning in boredom, just thank God you're not drowning in Lake Ayahuasca.
[03:13:03.382 --> 03:13:14.305]  Say another state.
[03:13:14.325 --> 03:13:15.185]  Say another state.
[03:13:16.126 --> 03:13:16.646]  Is it mine?
[03:13:16.806 --> 03:13:21.367]  Oh, that's a good one.
[03:13:21.387 --> 03:13:24.488]  You were asking before about the performance and what I think about it.
[03:13:24.508 --> 03:13:24.748]  Yeah.
[03:13:24.808 --> 03:13:26.249]  You know, largely I'm impressed.
[03:13:27.892 --> 03:13:30.874]  It's a sort of uncreative way to express what I'm feeling.
[03:13:30.914 --> 03:13:36.638]  I am so... completely uninterested in anything Hollywood.
[03:13:37.298 --> 03:13:40.481]  Seeing, you know, mainstream popular music, all of these stuff.
[03:13:40.501 --> 03:13:44.563]  In terms of actually, like, consuming the entertainment, or in terms of the drama behind?
[03:13:45.084 --> 03:13:45.464]  All of it.
[03:13:45.604 --> 03:13:45.844]  Yeah.
[03:13:45.984 --> 03:13:46.365]  All of it.
[03:13:46.485 --> 03:13:51.808]  It's like... It's like... Hollywood movies now are terrible.
[03:13:52.028 --> 03:13:53.429]  They're all... Nine out of ten of them, yeah.
[03:13:53.449 --> 03:13:54.330]  Yeah, most of them.
[03:13:54.410 --> 03:13:55.371]  I like Dune, but yes.
[03:13:55.816 --> 03:13:56.917]  Dune was alright, yeah.
[03:13:57.397 --> 03:13:58.758]  Top Gun was fantastic.
[03:13:58.798 --> 03:14:00.099]  That was the last movie that I watched.
[03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:01.140]  It was an 80s movie, though.
[03:14:01.320 --> 03:14:02.041]  Yeah, it was.
[03:14:02.221 --> 03:14:03.502]  Even though it came out, you know, two years ago.
[03:14:03.522 --> 03:14:03.923]  Correct.
[03:14:04.203 --> 03:14:04.583]  Correct.
[03:14:05.144 --> 03:14:06.344]  But they didn't woke-ify it.
[03:14:06.364 --> 03:14:07.165]  Yeah, it was great.
[03:14:07.305 --> 03:14:09.607]  Except for the fact that the enemy was unnamed.
[03:14:10.508 --> 03:14:11.809]  It was like just some obscure enemy.
[03:14:12.109 --> 03:14:14.331]  And they had female... Pilots.
[03:14:14.351 --> 03:14:15.031]  Pilots, right?
[03:14:15.071 --> 03:14:18.634]  Even though, in order to hold the nose up with those planes, it's like 35 pounds of consistent weight.
[03:14:18.694 --> 03:14:19.215]  It's stupid.
[03:14:19.435 --> 03:14:20.015]  Stupid.
[03:14:20.116 --> 03:14:21.296]  But anyway, yeah.
[03:14:24.451 --> 03:14:25.132]  I got you to say it.
[03:14:26.513 --> 03:14:30.718]  I am the most, like, I despise feminists.
[03:14:30.838 --> 03:14:31.919]  I despise feminism.
[03:14:32.079 --> 03:14:34.221]  I think that there needs to be less women in leadership.
[03:14:34.382 --> 03:14:39.087]  I am, I'm all... I don't care if, I don't care if a woman does whatever she wants.
[03:14:39.727 --> 03:14:42.931]  I just don't want anybody to get a job because they're a man or because they're a woman.
[03:14:43.424 --> 03:14:43.844]  You know what I mean?
[03:14:44.045 --> 03:14:44.245]  Yeah.
[03:14:44.305 --> 03:14:47.467]  Like, I don't care that there's a black lesbian press secretary.
[03:14:47.848 --> 03:14:51.491]  I care that the press secretary is the press secretary because they're a black lesbian.
[03:14:51.511 --> 03:14:51.811]  Correct.
[03:14:51.891 --> 03:14:52.872]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:14:52.992 --> 03:14:53.372]  Absolutely.
[03:14:53.392 --> 03:14:54.433]  And that's what I mean by that.
[03:14:54.473 --> 03:15:02.560]  I'm not completely opposed to women being in positions that, you know, have some sort of authority, although I do think that men are better at it.
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:05.122]  And I think that it is because men are less emotional.
[03:15:05.442 --> 03:15:06.663]  I think they're more pragmatic.
[03:15:07.344 --> 03:15:08.324]  Women are...
[03:15:09.145 --> 03:15:10.647]  Often led by emotion.
[03:15:10.707 --> 03:15:12.008]  We're just wired that way.
[03:15:12.429 --> 03:15:12.609]  Sure.
[03:15:12.689 --> 03:15:13.850]  I prefer male leadership.
[03:15:14.251 --> 03:15:14.491]  I do.
[03:15:15.312 --> 03:15:17.194]  Even like in workplaces.
[03:15:17.314 --> 03:15:18.775]  I always preferred male leadership.
[03:15:18.835 --> 03:15:21.238]  I found women to be generally unbalanced.
[03:15:21.278 --> 03:15:21.578]  Not all.
[03:15:21.598 --> 03:15:24.581]  Do you think most women actually feel that way at the core?
[03:15:25.282 --> 03:15:25.783]  I think so.
[03:15:25.803 --> 03:15:26.323]  Yeah.
[03:15:26.583 --> 03:15:29.286]  We're created to respect male leadership.
[03:15:29.326 --> 03:15:29.527]  Yeah.
[03:15:29.847 --> 03:15:30.107]  Yeah.
[03:15:30.968 --> 03:15:31.789]  Starting with our husband.
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:34.221]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[03:15:34.461 --> 03:15:38.943]  I mean, it's a difficult thing to talk about because it's ineffable and it's taboo.
[03:15:39.783 --> 03:15:48.587]  And people somehow think that if you say that something isn't congruent, it's the same as saying that something isn't equal, right?
[03:15:49.187 --> 03:15:51.488]  So like congruent means equal and the same.
[03:15:51.648 --> 03:15:52.988]  Four is congruent to four.
[03:15:53.409 --> 03:15:56.190]  But equal is like three plus one equals two plus two.
[03:15:56.330 --> 03:15:59.351]  Those aren't congruent because it's a different way of getting to the same conclusion.
[03:16:01.872 --> 03:16:02.473]  We're good to go.
[03:16:18.610 --> 03:16:18.770]  I don't
[03:16:39.445 --> 03:16:39.745]  I don't know.
[03:16:59.042 --> 03:16:59.963]  Yeah, it's such a great point.
[03:17:00.183 --> 03:17:07.387]  I mean, I had, you know, various leadership positions, went through so much leadership training in the corporate world before I did MediaChase.
[03:17:08.168 --> 03:17:15.192]  And you learn about all the different personality types and how to adjust your leadership style to all those different personalities.
[03:17:15.212 --> 03:17:16.913]  Did you do like the disc profile?
[03:17:17.073 --> 03:17:18.074]  Yeah, all of that, all of that.
[03:17:18.334 --> 03:17:23.178]  You know, years and years of workshops and things like that, all based on everyone's differences.
[03:17:23.679 --> 03:17:30.164]  To pretend that people aren't different or that you don't need to apply different tacts to different people is just, it's nonsense.
[03:17:30.184 --> 03:17:40.834]  I was listening to someone talking to, I think actually Elon shared this clip, and I think it was a Singaporean PM even maybe, saying, you know, that wokeism
[03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:46.034]  You know, warning people, like, I'm about to say something offensive, so maybe you need to leave the room.
[03:17:46.074 --> 03:17:50.658]  And this is a little bit of a different conversation, but not really, because you're treating everyone like they're sensitive.
[03:17:51.519 --> 03:17:57.725]  And, you know, he said it just, it does not build a resilient society.
[03:17:57.786 --> 03:18:00.768]  It absolutely is destroying the world.
[03:18:00.788 --> 03:18:01.409]  Right, right.
[03:18:01.629 --> 03:18:06.154]  Sometimes I say offensive things that I don't mean because they're offensive.
[03:18:07.901 --> 03:18:11.584]  Seriously, not to get a reaction, but just because it's like stopping a pussy, you know?
[03:18:11.844 --> 03:18:15.286]  Like when I said the fag thing about it, I would never genuinely call a gay person a fag.
[03:18:15.346 --> 03:18:16.327]  You know what I mean?
[03:18:16.788 --> 03:18:20.130]  But like, I hate people that say that I can't say fags, so I have to say it now.
[03:18:20.230 --> 03:18:20.850]  You know what I mean?
[03:18:21.091 --> 03:18:21.991]  Same with the word retarded.
[03:18:22.031 --> 03:18:24.913]  I would never call somebody who was mentally challenged a retard and tease them about it.
[03:18:25.834 --> 03:18:34.580]  But you have to have the word and you have to build the callousness and you have to, I don't know, just establish an understanding and assumption that people have the best intentions.
[03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:39.923]  And if you install this hypersensitivity, then it just becomes easier to criminalize or villainize anyone else.
[03:18:39.963 --> 03:18:43.306]  It doesn't actually make people better people, it just makes it easier to claim that someone else is a villain.
[03:18:43.506 --> 03:18:44.707]  But also bring back bullying.
[03:18:45.007 --> 03:18:46.648]  Yes, we should beat the hell out of the small kids.
[03:18:48.789 --> 03:18:49.049]  You know?
[03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:52.692]  So they can become Secretary of Transportation later and pretend they're gay.
[03:18:55.822 --> 03:18:58.084]  All right, let's put this up.
[03:18:58.104 --> 03:18:58.905]  They're doing the walls.
[03:18:59.125 --> 03:19:03.069]  They're doing the funeral slideshow, even though he's not dead yet.
[03:19:03.849 --> 03:19:11.176]  Tim agreed to serve as faculty advisor because he knew how impactful it would be to have a football team involved.
[03:19:11.196 --> 03:19:15.320]  He inspired the students, and he changed lives.
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:18.083]  It's just so joyful and everything he does, but it's also stacked up.
[03:19:18.103 --> 03:19:19.484]  You know, what do you believe is to be right?
[03:19:24.743 --> 03:19:29.645]  I only did it because my kids asked me to.
[03:19:29.985 --> 03:19:33.286]  I only did it because I saw what Trump said about the Charlottesville fine people.
[03:19:40.097 --> 03:19:45.822]  But you know, again, what we were saying before about them toning it down, Walls is an example of them toning it down.
[03:19:45.842 --> 03:19:47.343]  Because he's, you know, a family man.
[03:19:47.703 --> 03:19:51.466]  Yes, he's, you know, trying to make kids gay or whatever.
[03:19:51.486 --> 03:19:54.348]  But, well, he is!
[03:19:54.388 --> 03:19:59.632]  He's like, there are gay pride events, wearing his name in gay letters on their shirts.
[03:20:01.544 --> 03:20:04.206]  But I mean, he appears as a family man.
[03:20:04.286 --> 03:20:06.308]  He appears as sort of a dad.
[03:20:06.348 --> 03:20:07.669]  He probably is a sweet guy.
[03:20:07.709 --> 03:20:11.051]  He's a Maoist, so his policies are going to lead to death and destruction.
[03:20:14.193 --> 03:20:15.394]  Oh, gun rights.
[03:20:15.754 --> 03:20:16.355]  Oh, hunting.
[03:20:16.515 --> 03:20:17.135]  Was that an AR-15?
[03:20:17.215 --> 03:20:18.556]  I didn't see.
[03:20:18.576 --> 03:20:18.776]  It wasn't.
[03:20:18.796 --> 03:20:19.377]  It was like a shotgun.
[03:20:19.397 --> 03:20:20.257]  But anyway, he's just another example.
[03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:32.102]  What is that outfit?
[03:20:32.322 --> 03:20:32.682]  I'm sorry.
[03:20:32.782 --> 03:20:41.709]  Like, do you remember that one time we did a bunch of LSD and we watched Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood?
[03:20:41.969 --> 03:20:43.310]  I want to dress like that.
[03:20:43.330 --> 03:20:46.352]  That kid was sniffing that dog for ages.
[03:20:46.572 --> 03:20:49.634]  Well, you know, you see enough Joe Biden clips, you start sniffing hair wherever you see it.
[03:20:50.475 --> 03:20:51.916]  Not a Minnesota turkey special.
[03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:56.311]  Here's that lady.
[03:20:56.671 --> 03:20:59.413]  I wouldn't be letting so many children around him.
[03:21:17.268 --> 03:21:18.789]  They're not doing any of that.
[03:21:18.809 --> 03:21:22.572]  They haven't done any gender stuff.
[03:21:22.672 --> 03:21:24.153]  Have you noticed?
[03:21:24.173 --> 03:21:27.515]  They know that everybody thinks it sucks.
[03:21:27.555 --> 03:21:29.196]  He's slapping his heart.
[03:21:39.103 --> 03:21:40.423]  He's a heart clutcher.
[03:21:40.463 --> 03:21:44.744]  He's going to do it, I think, probably in response to the standing ovation that's canned.
[03:21:44.904 --> 03:21:49.665]  I think we're going to see some heart clutching in the first 30 seconds of him becoming visual on the stage.
[03:21:50.465 --> 03:21:51.826]  All right, viewers, start counting.
[03:21:51.846 --> 03:21:53.286]  30 seconds.
[03:21:53.306 --> 03:21:53.926]  Clutch the heart.
[03:21:53.946 --> 03:21:53.926]  27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21.
[03:22:05.852 --> 03:22:06.933]  19, 18.
[03:22:05.932 --> 03:22:06.933]  Yeah, there we go.
[03:22:06.953 --> 03:22:07.673]  That was it.
[03:22:07.693 --> 03:22:10.534]  Oh, you was right!
[03:22:10.554 --> 03:22:11.214]  18 seconds!
[03:22:11.554 --> 03:22:13.394]  It was 12, 18 seconds left.
[03:22:13.414 --> 03:22:13.735]  12 seconds.
[03:22:13.755 --> 03:22:14.375]  Counting down from 30.
[03:22:14.435 --> 03:22:15.575]  There's the heart clutch.
[03:22:15.795 --> 03:22:16.195]  I masked.
[03:22:16.515 --> 03:22:17.175]  Yeah, that's okay.
[03:22:17.216 --> 03:22:17.596]  Mask sucks.
[03:22:17.656 --> 03:22:18.236]  It's not for girls.
[03:22:18.256 --> 03:22:18.756]  Thank you.
[03:22:18.916 --> 03:22:28.959]  Do you reckon we'll get another heart clutch?
[03:22:31.560 --> 03:22:32.460]  I'm gonna just take my win.
[03:22:34.043 --> 03:22:34.723]  Just take you in?
[03:22:34.763 --> 03:22:37.286]  Yeah, I don't want to neutralize it by getting another prediction wrong.
[03:22:46.455 --> 03:22:48.136]  You don't ever have to grab your heart.
[03:22:48.597 --> 03:22:50.539]  Like, you actually can't grab it.
[03:22:50.639 --> 03:22:51.480]  You can only grab your boob.
[03:22:52.557 --> 03:22:54.097]  Like, you know, it's an organ.
[03:22:54.117 --> 03:22:54.778]  You can't grab it.
[03:22:55.038 --> 03:22:55.418]  Yeah.
[03:22:56.238 --> 03:22:58.119]  Have you ever, like, felt the need to, like, grab your heart?
[03:22:58.159 --> 03:22:58.459]  Yes.
[03:22:58.899 --> 03:22:59.159]  Really?
[03:22:59.219 --> 03:23:00.639]  It's a very female thing.
[03:23:00.659 --> 03:23:05.661]  You see, like, a dog die in a movie and it's like... It's a very female thing.
[03:23:06.641 --> 03:23:09.242]  So he's actually... He's doing it to come off less threatening.
[03:23:09.262 --> 03:23:10.102]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:23:10.202 --> 03:23:10.942]  Leadership.
[03:23:11.002 --> 03:23:11.162]  Yeah.
[03:23:19.457 --> 03:23:20.999]  He's such a Rust Belt guy.
[03:23:21.379 --> 03:23:27.666]  It's the honor of my life to accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States.
[03:23:28.887 --> 03:23:29.148]  Dude.
[03:23:30.129 --> 03:23:33.793]  Hang on, so- It's like, he looks like Santa Claus if Santa Claus stopped believing in God.
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:37.362]  Well, hang on, no one voted for him either, right?
[03:23:37.922 --> 03:23:39.163]  No.
[03:23:39.423 --> 03:23:42.125]  So how is he accepting anyone's... anything?
[03:23:42.145 --> 03:23:49.690]  Because he was named as the VP by the person with the delegates, and so he is also, like, legally now on the ticket.
[03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:51.151]  No, I get that.
[03:23:51.191 --> 03:23:55.314]  He's accepting what Kamala gave him, but not what anybody in that audience gave him.
[03:23:55.374 --> 03:23:56.535]  Yes, yes, I see what you mean.
[03:23:56.575 --> 03:23:56.935]  Joy!
[03:23:56.995 --> 03:23:57.616]  The joy.
[03:24:04.545 --> 03:24:07.946]  Now I grew up in Butte, Nebraska.
[03:24:09.547 --> 03:24:12.127]  A town of 400 people.
[03:24:13.407 --> 03:24:16.508]  I had 24 kids in my high school class.
[03:24:17.788 --> 03:24:19.069]  And none of them went to Yale.
[03:24:20.829 --> 03:24:23.790]  You literally went to China on behalf of Harvard.
[03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:28.911]  Growing up in a small town like that, you learn how to take care of each other.
[03:24:31.482 --> 03:24:33.124]  That family down the road.
[03:24:33.885 --> 03:24:35.006]  They may not think like you do.
[03:24:35.026 --> 03:24:36.507]  They may not pray like you do.
[03:24:36.527 --> 03:24:37.869]  They may not love like you do.
[03:24:37.929 --> 03:24:39.370]  But they're your neighbors.
[03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:41.072]  And you look out for them.
[03:24:41.132 --> 03:24:41.993]  And they look out for you.
[03:24:42.033 --> 03:24:42.553]  Everybody belongs.
[03:24:52.143 --> 03:25:00.627]  Some lady last night came and prayed and she was like up on stage with a Jewish guy and so I guess what, she doesn't want to offend the Jewish guy?
[03:25:00.647 --> 03:25:02.888]  But it was unbelievable.
[03:25:02.908 --> 03:25:03.929]  She just would not say Jesus.
[03:25:03.949 --> 03:25:09.511]  Blaine Kamala's husband's Jewish so it would be kind of offensive to him if Jesus was mentioned.
[03:25:09.792 --> 03:25:15.534]  But is it offensive to the Christians that you can't mention Jesus because someone's offended by the fact that you can't mention Jesus?
[03:25:15.554 --> 03:25:16.155]  Do you know what?
[03:25:16.235 --> 03:25:17.275]  It's just crazy.
[03:25:17.295 --> 03:25:18.556]  You want to talk about inclusion?
[03:25:18.736 --> 03:25:20.357]  Everyone's included except Christians.
[03:25:20.717 --> 03:25:20.917]  Right.
[03:25:21.457 --> 03:25:21.797]  I hate it.
[03:25:21.877 --> 03:25:24.918]  Well, leftism is just one giant non-denominational church.
[03:25:25.758 --> 03:25:26.678]  Except Christianity.
[03:25:26.698 --> 03:25:27.318]  Yeah, right.
[03:25:27.358 --> 03:25:29.399]  Right, you're right.
[03:25:30.099 --> 03:25:30.819]  Everybody but you.
[03:25:31.039 --> 03:25:31.319]  Yes.
[03:25:31.419 --> 03:25:37.161]  And thank God for the GI Bill that allowed my dad and me to go to college.
[03:25:37.241 --> 03:25:38.761]  And millions of other Americans.
[03:25:38.841 --> 03:25:43.322]  Oh, that guy's got a mask on.
[03:25:43.342 --> 03:25:44.623]  Yeah, there's a lot of masks.
[03:25:44.643 --> 03:25:47.543]  Eventually, like the rest of my family, I fell in love with Jesus.
[03:25:51.713 --> 03:26:00.001]  I think you're putting a mask in the wrong place, dude.
[03:26:00.902 --> 03:26:03.004]  He seems slightly genuine.
[03:26:03.385 --> 03:26:04.205]  No, he means it.
[03:26:04.365 --> 03:26:06.227]  Yeah, yeah, he means it.
[03:26:06.448 --> 03:26:09.751]  I mean, he's a phony in the sense that he lied about his service.
[03:26:10.396 --> 03:26:10.676]  Yeah.
[03:26:11.677 --> 03:26:14.618]  But... He can't be trusted with absolutely anything.
[03:26:14.678 --> 03:26:16.979]  But... He's actually a mount.
[03:26:17.019 --> 03:26:24.422]  Like, there are communists who use communism to subjugate people and whip people, and then there are communists who, like, love it and believe in it.
[03:26:24.562 --> 03:26:28.844]  He is, like, I think he is one of the, like, true believers.
[03:26:28.904 --> 03:26:30.664]  But he thinks that that's gonna help America?
[03:26:32.116 --> 03:26:42.959]  Yeah, I think he believes that communism is the future, that democracy is the past, and that total centralized control in the most efficient way possible is the only way to bring about true equity and equality for all people.
[03:26:44.139 --> 03:26:44.539]  Wow.
[03:26:44.639 --> 03:26:46.199]  Yeah.
[03:26:46.239 --> 03:26:50.660]  Which is really stupid to believe, given that you see that communism never works.
[03:26:51.541 --> 03:26:52.001]  But he does.
[03:26:52.021 --> 03:26:54.621]  I think he really believes it.
[03:26:54.701 --> 03:26:58.042]  Does Chase Geyser think that Tim Walz is redeemable?
[03:26:58.502 --> 03:26:58.782]  No.
[03:26:59.422 --> 03:27:00.963]  No, no, he's irredeemable.
[03:27:02.366 --> 03:27:03.207]  But he really believes it.
[03:27:03.227 --> 03:27:03.387]  Amen, Tim.
[03:27:03.407 --> 03:27:03.487]  Amen.
[03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:21.613]  My teacher in junior high, Mrs. Lanier, had two affairs.
[03:27:21.974 --> 03:27:23.275]  And she got fired over it.
[03:27:23.855 --> 03:27:27.219]  And the guys that she... Yeah, the guys she slept with, they worked at the school.
[03:27:27.239 --> 03:27:27.979]  Right?
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:30.061]  It was Mr. Cox and Mr. Butts.
[03:27:30.361 --> 03:27:30.842]  Literally.
[03:27:31.122 --> 03:27:32.383]  I swear to God, it's not even a joke.
[03:27:32.684 --> 03:27:33.444]  I'm not making this up.
[03:27:33.464 --> 03:27:34.585]  It sounds like something I would make up.
[03:27:35.086 --> 03:27:37.228]  After Mr. Cox, they were like, you gotta get out of here!
[03:27:38.979 --> 03:27:39.579]  Wow.
[03:27:39.859 --> 03:27:40.760]  These days it'd be celebrated.
[03:27:40.780 --> 03:27:40.920]  Maybe.
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:41.140]  Yeah.
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:42.741]  Well, they would probably go to prison for abusing their authority.
[03:27:53.675 --> 03:27:55.596]  By sleeping with somebody that worked under them.
[03:27:56.837 --> 03:27:58.879]  So back then it was just perceived that she was slutty.
[03:27:59.039 --> 03:27:59.199]  Right.
[03:27:59.219 --> 03:28:00.480]  Trying to like sleep her way up.
[03:28:00.520 --> 03:28:00.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:04.442]  But now it would be like, no, I felt like I had to because it was my boss.
[03:28:04.643 --> 03:28:04.743]  Oh.
[03:28:04.823 --> 03:28:05.984]  You know what I mean?
[03:28:06.104 --> 03:28:07.905]  Yeah, and you've got to believe old women, right?
[03:28:07.925 --> 03:28:08.045]  Yeah.
[03:28:08.085 --> 03:28:09.806]  If she would have been fine, they would have gotten fired.
[03:28:10.026 --> 03:28:10.327]  Right.
[03:28:10.347 --> 03:28:13.028]  Maybe they all got fired, I can't remember.
[03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:17.011]  Every kid in our state gets breakfast and lunch every day.
[03:28:17.592 --> 03:28:19.473]  What are you going to fade them, pre-kids and mRNA?
[03:28:21.793 --> 03:28:30.296]  So while other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours.
[03:28:30.356 --> 03:28:32.136]  They're putting it in lettuce now, Chase.
[03:28:32.236 --> 03:28:32.776]  Are they really?
[03:28:33.237 --> 03:28:35.557]  Don't you know Tennessee banned vaccine lettuce?
[03:28:35.677 --> 03:28:39.078]  Not just vaccine lettuce, but vaccines in food.
[03:28:39.098 --> 03:28:43.540]  Yeah, they actually had this big debate about it and it was just Democrat like, oh, this is pointless.
[03:28:43.580 --> 03:28:47.641]  They were actually putting vaccines in the food or they were just making legislation to prevent it from happening?
[03:28:47.921 --> 03:28:50.002]  So they've started doing it.
[03:28:50.502 --> 03:28:54.305]  You know, they've started doing trials at University of Colorado.
[03:28:54.345 --> 03:28:55.185]  To see if it'll work?
[03:28:55.445 --> 03:28:56.826]  Like, if you can eat it?
[03:28:56.986 --> 03:29:00.128]  Yeah, they successfully put mRNA in lettuce.
[03:29:00.548 --> 03:29:05.091]  And then these lawmakers in Tennessee called wind of the fact that this was starting to be widespread.
[03:29:05.391 --> 03:29:06.191]  Yeah.
[03:29:06.611 --> 03:29:09.573]  And they were actually, they've introduced a bill.
[03:29:09.593 --> 03:29:11.694]  You might not even know that you're eating a vaccine.
[03:29:11.854 --> 03:29:12.154]  Correct.
[03:29:12.174 --> 03:29:16.257]  That's, man, I was a lobbyist in Tennessee for a couple of years.
[03:29:18.345 --> 03:29:29.437]  I was an intern for a lobbyist when I was in college, and I actually was a registered lobbyist in Tennessee for one or two years after college for a specific employer I was working for to try to get funding for a project we were working on.
[03:29:29.537 --> 03:29:35.343]  And when I was there, Tennessee was debating as to whether or not to make the Bible the state book.
[03:29:36.109 --> 03:29:36.369]  Wow.
[03:29:36.490 --> 03:29:37.691]  Because it's a very right-wing state.
[03:29:37.891 --> 03:29:39.754]  It's a very Baptist state, very Christian state.
[03:29:39.854 --> 03:29:42.838]  Even the Democrats there are actually God-fearing Democrats for the most part.
[03:29:42.858 --> 03:29:44.821]  You know, they've just left us now and the national's getting worse.
[03:29:45.221 --> 03:29:46.263]  Tennessee's cool, man.
[03:29:46.343 --> 03:29:46.883]  There's billboards.
[03:29:46.903 --> 03:29:50.508]  Well, the thing that was cool about it was half the people
[03:29:51.631 --> 03:30:04.415]  One half wanted the Bible to be the state book because they were Christian, and the other half, who were also Christian, thought it was an inappropriate breach of the separation of church and state, even though it's not constitutional, right?
[03:30:04.975 --> 03:30:12.737]  And so, the Republicans actually voted in large not to make the Bible the state book, despite the fact that they wanted it to be personally.
[03:30:12.777 --> 03:30:13.437]  I respect that.
[03:30:13.457 --> 03:30:16.778]  Because that was how classy it was in Tennessee when I was there.
[03:30:16.798 --> 03:30:19.299]  There was a lot of really good leadership there at the time, I don't know about now.
[03:30:20.677 --> 03:30:23.758]  Well, they banned chemtrails, banned vaccine lettuce.
[03:30:23.818 --> 03:30:24.438]  It's pretty good.
[03:30:24.458 --> 03:30:26.098]  They've done some good stuff.
[03:30:26.538 --> 03:30:29.319]  I remember I was in a hearing, and I can't remember who it was.
[03:30:29.339 --> 03:30:30.939]  I think it was Senator David Henry.
[03:30:30.959 --> 03:30:32.640]  I could be butchering his name.
[03:30:32.800 --> 03:30:35.440]  He died, and he was like, he'd been in there forever.
[03:30:35.460 --> 03:30:35.900]  He was ancient.
[03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:41.481]  He always chewed on a cigar because he couldn't smoke in the building anymore, but he missed the days when he could smoke a cigar in the Senate building, you know?
[03:30:41.621 --> 03:30:41.882]  Yeah.
[03:30:42.462 --> 03:30:48.143]  And they were debating whether or not to make it a law to require motorcyclists to wear helmets.
[03:30:48.968 --> 03:30:49.268]  Right.
[03:30:49.449 --> 03:30:53.353]  And he stood up, and when he stood up to speak, he rarely did, everybody shut up and listened.
[03:30:53.493 --> 03:30:54.815]  Like, we're going to do whatever he says, you know?
[03:30:54.835 --> 03:30:58.058]  It was just like, he was so quiet, big stick, whenever he spoke, awesome.
[03:30:58.419 --> 03:31:03.725]  He said, any man doesn't wear a helmet on a motorcycle is a fool.
[03:31:03.785 --> 03:31:07.829]  And he goes, but a man ought to have freedom to be a fool.
[03:31:09.537 --> 03:31:10.197]  That's great.
[03:31:10.217 --> 03:31:11.097]  Anyway, back to Tim Walz.
[03:31:11.137 --> 03:31:11.918]  Sorry guys.
[03:31:31.909 --> 03:31:35.351]  You guys are killing kids in a van all the time.
[03:31:35.371 --> 03:31:35.451]  Yeah.
[03:31:35.491 --> 03:31:35.871]  Literally.
[03:31:35.892 --> 03:31:39.013]  Dozens today have been murdered outside in the name of you.
[03:31:39.093 --> 03:31:43.676]  A sacrifice to the cult of leftism that's made outside the temple.
[03:31:43.736 --> 03:31:44.937]  Oh my gosh.
[03:31:45.277 --> 03:31:49.300]  They might have set that up to like... Like satanic energy?
[03:31:50.521 --> 03:31:51.261]  Yes.
[03:31:51.321 --> 03:31:51.941]  I know you are.
[03:31:51.961 --> 03:31:55.264]  I just, I just, I just, this is the best job I ever had.
[03:31:55.664 --> 03:31:58.566]  Cause nowhere else will this conversation happen in front of millions of people.
[03:32:00.584 --> 03:32:01.444]  You're absolutely right.
[03:32:01.564 --> 03:32:07.546]  It might have been like a satanic ritual with intentional child sacrifice to like harvest the energy for this evil cult that is there.
[03:32:07.586 --> 03:32:12.807]  Correct, and to further, you know, impart something on all of these attendees.
[03:32:13.307 --> 03:32:17.548]  When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're gonna use it.
[03:32:22.649 --> 03:32:25.910]  And we know, if these guys get back in the White House,
[03:32:26.889 --> 03:32:29.152]  They'll start jacking up the costs on the middle class.
[03:32:29.752 --> 03:32:32.215]  They'll repeal the Affordable Care Act.
[03:32:33.417 --> 03:32:35.179]  They'll gut Social Security and Medicare.
[03:32:35.199 --> 03:32:37.362]  Whose healthcare hasn't gone up ever since that passed?
[03:32:38.035 --> 03:32:40.697]  Cost of health care goes up at least 10% every year for everyone.
[03:32:40.757 --> 03:32:42.938]  It's even higher than inflation.
[03:32:43.499 --> 03:32:44.780]  It's very, very high.
[03:32:44.960 --> 03:32:45.960]  Here's the thing.
[03:32:46.020 --> 03:32:48.702]  It's an agenda nobody asked for.
[03:32:48.922 --> 03:32:56.667]  It's an agenda that serves nobody except the richest and the most extreme amongst us.
[03:32:56.808 --> 03:33:00.670]  And it's an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need.
[03:33:09.356 --> 03:33:10.937]  It's insane, isn't it?
[03:33:11.057 --> 03:33:13.039]  But thanks for the Affordable Care Act, you know, it's great.
[03:33:13.059 --> 03:33:13.760]  My kids loved it.
[03:33:13.780 --> 03:33:14.600]  It's dangerous.
[03:33:15.621 --> 03:33:17.443]  It's not just me saying so.
[03:33:18.023 --> 03:33:19.444]  It's Trump's own people.
[03:33:19.784 --> 03:33:21.226]  They were with him for four years.
[03:33:21.806 --> 03:33:26.710]  They're warning us that the next four years will be much, much worse.
[03:33:26.730 --> 03:33:32.535]  It was that traitor that came out and spoke as the Republican that came out and said, I'm here for the Democrats.
[03:33:33.115 --> 03:33:36.417]  It was the, wasn't it one of the ladies that was in the Trump administration?
[03:33:36.437 --> 03:33:43.602]  I think she was the same lady who claimed that Trump attempted to grab the steering wheel of Secret Service on January 6th to like turn it around.
[03:33:43.982 --> 03:33:46.244]  No, there was a guy there, I believe it was yesterday.
[03:33:46.264 --> 03:33:49.326]  Same sort of messaging.
[03:33:49.386 --> 03:33:50.487]  I'm not sure.
[03:33:50.807 --> 03:33:54.029]  Was he like a leadership person or was he a regular voter?
[03:33:54.629 --> 03:33:57.071]  I think he was a leadership person.
[03:33:58.432 --> 03:34:00.093]  I'm surprised they haven't had a McKenzie just speak.
[03:34:01.400 --> 03:34:04.684]  Maybe he'll be one of the surprise speakers tomorrow.
[03:34:04.724 --> 03:34:05.845]  Alright, now say Joy.
[03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:27.333]  From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, as an attorney general, as a United States senator, and then our vice president, she's fought on the side of the American people.
[03:34:27.833 --> 03:34:35.936]  She's taken on the predators and fraudsters, she's taken down the transnational gangs, and she stood up to powerful corporate interests.
[03:34:36.416 --> 03:34:41.057]  She has never hesitated to reach across that aisle if it meant improving your lives.
[03:34:41.237 --> 03:34:43.017]  Do you know what else has been amazing to me Chase?
[03:34:43.037 --> 03:34:49.699]  I watched these people yesterday holding up these freedom signs as they're talking about holding Big Pharma accountable and they're cheering.
[03:34:50.819 --> 03:34:56.901]  It's like, your party literally imposed, the Democratic Party, the Democrats imposed vaccine mandates.
[03:34:57.141 --> 03:34:58.241]  Yes, 100%.
[03:34:58.721 --> 03:35:00.582]  And, he said joy by the way.
[03:35:01.362 --> 03:35:08.264]  And, the crazy thing about the Affordable Care Act is they put price caps on, profit caps, on how much the
[03:35:09.144 --> 03:35:09.364]  I don't
[03:35:28.439 --> 03:35:36.722]  To want the cost of care to go up because that's the only way that they can raise their premiums so that that 10% is a larger number in terms of volume, right?
[03:35:37.002 --> 03:35:44.105]  So now it's the only form of insurance that exists in which the insurance company makes more money if what they're paying for in claims is more expensive.
[03:35:44.385 --> 03:35:50.067]  So the insurance companies now want the cost of medicine and care to be as expensive as possible because they can only make that plus 10%.
[03:35:50.347 --> 03:35:50.627]  Right.
[03:35:51.288 --> 03:35:51.488]  Right?
[03:35:51.908 --> 03:35:52.848]  And that's what he's done.
[03:35:53.148 --> 03:35:57.290]  So they can talk about taking on big pharma, but the Affordable Care Act has made astronomical
[03:35:58.231 --> 03:35:59.292]  I don't know, Chase.
[03:35:59.352 --> 03:36:00.794]  I think he's not as harmless as he seems.
[03:36:00.814 --> 03:36:01.414]  You're probably right.
[03:36:20.578 --> 03:36:22.320]  He overrode that boat.
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:29.346]  I remember when they were... Oh, and he was shooting rubber bullets at people on their front porch when he was governor.
[03:36:29.867 --> 03:36:34.771]  Remember the people that were out on their porch during the lockdowns that were getting shot with rubber bullets by cops parading through the streets?
[03:36:34.791 --> 03:36:35.392]  Oh my gosh.
[03:36:35.432 --> 03:36:37.093]  He allowed the cities to burn, no problem.
[03:36:37.113 --> 03:36:38.755]  You're right, he's just a shitty, terrible person.
[03:36:38.775 --> 03:36:43.860]  And voted to include pedophiles in the other, you know, gender and...
[03:36:45.342 --> 03:36:48.022]  Just like the LGBTQ plus community or whatever?
[03:36:48.343 --> 03:36:54.184]  And then someone, like the lawmakers were fighting about it and he made sure to bring them back into the definition.
[03:36:54.544 --> 03:36:54.864]  Really?
[03:36:54.904 --> 03:36:57.744]  So he would call a pedophile a minor attracted person?
[03:36:57.924 --> 03:37:04.385]  Yeah, and he would say, argue that they're protected under the, you know, other sexual orientations.
[03:37:04.706 --> 03:37:05.006]  Wow.
[03:37:05.406 --> 03:37:10.227]  So if a pedophile rapes my kid and I kill him, not only is it murder, but it's also a hate crime?
[03:37:10.547 --> 03:37:10.947]  Yes.
[03:37:11.327 --> 03:37:11.947]  Oh my God.
[03:37:11.967 --> 03:37:12.287]  Yeah.
[03:37:13.592 --> 03:37:15.093]  Alright, you're right, he's an evil bastard.
[03:37:15.313 --> 03:37:15.533]  Yes.
[03:37:15.573 --> 03:37:20.636]  What do you expect from a guy who's guilty of stolen valor?
[03:37:21.917 --> 03:37:24.299]  There's gonna be a slime bag for life.
[03:37:24.459 --> 03:37:27.180]  And he hasn't, he's still going, he's still running with it.
[03:37:27.380 --> 03:37:28.661]  Yeah, doubling down.
[03:37:28.821 --> 03:37:32.604]  That's how we'll build a country where workers come first.
[03:37:33.004 --> 03:37:36.086]  Healthcare and housing are human rights.
[03:37:38.787 --> 03:37:42.650]  And the government stays the hell out of your bedroom.
[03:37:43.973 --> 03:37:45.614]  But not out of your wallet!
[03:37:47.935 --> 03:37:59.619]  That's how we make America a place where no child is left hungry, where no community is left behind, where nobody gets told they don't belong.
[03:37:59.979 --> 03:38:06.622]  That's how we're gonna fight, and as the next President of the United States always says, when we fight,
[03:38:10.299 --> 03:38:11.681]  Grab the hot!
[03:38:11.721 --> 03:38:12.682]  Grab the hot!
[03:38:48.974 --> 03:38:51.495]  All right, well, let's end this hell as soon as possible.
[03:38:51.515 --> 03:38:53.755]  Mareezy, it has been an honor and a true pleasure.
[03:38:53.835 --> 03:38:57.936]  Actually, I've experienced some joy tonight to have you on air with me.
[03:38:58.457 --> 03:38:59.817]  I've been a fan of your work for so long.
[03:38:59.837 --> 03:39:05.018]  You've been such an awesome info warrior and contributor and friend of this network with all the time that you volunteer to host 4th Hours.
[03:39:05.038 --> 03:39:06.259]  You always do such a wonderful job.
[03:39:06.779 --> 03:39:09.620]  Truly been awesome to have you and it was a pleasure having Rex as well.
[03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:10.820]  He's always a joy to have around.
[03:39:11.769 --> 03:39:12.830]  Thank you so much for coming.
[03:39:12.930 --> 03:39:19.774]  Let the audience know where they can find you and follow you, and then I'll say a few more things, and we'll go to this amazing video and call it a night.
[03:39:20.035 --> 03:39:20.975]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:39:21.195 --> 03:39:23.237]  You can find me on zmedia.com.
[03:39:23.257 --> 03:39:30.121]  That's z-triple-e-media-dot-com, also x-z-underscore-media, also the triple-e there.
[03:39:30.862 --> 03:39:34.024]  And, of course, usually every Tuesday at 2 p.m.
[03:39:34.064 --> 03:39:38.307]  Central, I guest host the Alex Jones Show, and can I just encourage absolutely everyone
[03:39:38.827 --> 03:39:41.088]  Please make sure that you support InfoWars.
[03:39:41.128 --> 03:39:50.472]  This is not just, you know, they're not just covering things like the DNC and making it palatable for the viewers.
[03:39:51.252 --> 03:39:57.115]  As Chase said, you know, making sure that we're watching our enemy, but also bringing you literally ahead of the game.
[03:39:57.135 --> 03:40:03.317]  Like Chase said before, you know, Alex was first with the RFK News and then how many people actually gave him credit for it?
[03:40:03.517 --> 03:40:04.638]  Let's be honest, you know.
[03:40:05.759 --> 03:40:07.460]  And Alex has been first about so much.
[03:40:07.520 --> 03:40:09.201]  The team here, they work so hard.
[03:40:09.581 --> 03:40:14.845]  So I'm encouraging everyone to go to infowarsstore.com or drjonesnaturals.
[03:40:14.885 --> 03:40:18.387]  And Chase, you want to say something about one of the products there, I think?
[03:40:18.747 --> 03:40:19.508]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:40:21.465 --> 03:40:30.230]  Folks, we've got a lot of amazing products and the reason that InfoWars has been on the air for so long is because the lifetime value of our customers is so high.
[03:40:30.850 --> 03:40:44.638]  I don't think I'm legally allowed to disclose to you how much the average customer spends on InfoWarsStore.com, but I can guarantee to you that if you buy ones from InfoWarsStore.com, you are going to be a customer for an extended period of time based on the numbers that we have internally here.
[03:40:44.978 --> 03:40:52.360]  And the reason for that is not just because people love InfoWars and Alex Jones and the other great hosts and this network and what we do, but it's because the products actually work.
[03:40:52.780 --> 03:40:57.201]  If this was just about supporting InfoWars, then people would just go to the donating tab and they wouldn't buy the products.
[03:40:57.221 --> 03:41:04.883]  But instead of donating, people actually buy the products over and over again, because once you take it once, maybe the first time you buy it, it's like a charity thing or a fight for free speech thing.
[03:41:05.243 --> 03:41:12.985]  But once you actually start using the products and seeing the difference that they make in your life, that's what makes the lifetime value of our customers, the returning number of customers so high for us.
[03:41:13.025 --> 03:41:13.565]  So please,
[03:41:14.625 --> 03:41:25.499]  Keep us on the air while we are under total assault from like the Soros' literally assaulting us, trying to take Alex Jones off the air, trying to silence everyone here, imprisoning some of our hosts.
[03:41:25.519 --> 03:41:30.565]  I mean, if you're a full-time host here at InfoWars, there's a 33% chance that you'll be imprisoned.
[03:41:30.745 --> 03:41:30.925]  I don't
[03:41:47.011 --> 03:41:47.632]  Let's do it!
[03:42:02.945 --> 03:42:03.566]  We're good to go.
[03:42:32.444 --> 03:42:35.547]  The good intentions and demands and commands of God in the Bible.
[03:42:35.607 --> 03:42:39.870]  We are definitely a Christian organization fighting for that which is righteous against that which is evil.
[03:42:39.890 --> 03:42:44.093]  Which is the epitome of what the whole story of the Bible and creation is.
[03:42:44.574 --> 03:42:48.156]  Please go to Infowarsstore.com now if you're looking for specific suggestions as to which
[03:42:48.877 --> 03:42:49.457]  Product to get.
[03:42:49.957 --> 03:42:50.758]  Any of them are good.
[03:42:50.978 --> 03:42:51.598]  They're all real.
[03:42:51.618 --> 03:42:52.438]  They're all the highest quality.
[03:42:52.458 --> 03:42:53.358]  They're all the best deals.
[03:42:53.458 --> 03:42:54.879]  All that stuff is totally legitimate.
[03:42:55.119 --> 03:43:01.900]  You hear people criticize InfoWars all the time for the things we say, but you never hear them criticize us for the things we sell, really, do you?
[03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:05.441]  That's because there's nothing negative to say about the stuff we sell, right?
[03:43:05.801 --> 03:43:10.523]  And you can go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get Vitamin C plus Zinc with Rosehips.
[03:43:10.583 --> 03:43:11.363]  Now this is different.
[03:43:11.863 --> 03:43:20.789]  Like so many of our products are different from other competitors, whether it's pharmacies or grocery store bought supplements, in that this has rose hips in it, which makes it bioavailable.
[03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:31.817]  So many supplements that you buy in the mainstream market, even if it actually does have 5,000% of whatever the daily value of B12 is, they don't have the bioavailability ingredients in them, so you just flush them out and your body can't even absorb them.
[03:43:32.057 --> 03:43:39.903]  But most of our products, if not all of our products, have something added extra that is for the sole purpose of making sure that your body can actually absorb the substances
[03:43:40.063 --> 03:43:40.603]  We're good to go.
