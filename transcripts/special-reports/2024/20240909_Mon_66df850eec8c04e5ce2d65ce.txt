[00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:03.936]  James Earl Jones has just made the jump into hyperspace.
[00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:20.380]  He played King Lear, he played Darth Vader, and I always thought in the interviews I saw with him on PBS, other places, he was very, very intelligent, had an amazing work ethic, and I was just thinking the other day about him, for some reason, I hardly ever think about him, I saw a clip of him online, I thought, man, James Earl Jones is like,
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.461]  I went and looked it up.
[00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.282]  93 years old.
[00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:23.243]  He's tough.
[00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:24.324]  I wonder how long he'll live.
[00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:25.445]  And boom, gone.
[00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.268]  So just an example of how life is so precious and how each person's different.
[00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:36.115]  And the art, the culture, the literature, the love, the passion, also the evil and corruption humans can bring is amazing.
[00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.497]  AI can't replace humans.
[00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:42.700]  It just shows us our art, our culture, back at us in an amazing way.
[00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.843]  And so we feel like it's God or something.
[00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:47.004]  Well, we're not God.
[00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:47.724]  It's not God.
[00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:50.046]  But we are the thing that's building the AI.
[00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.128]  It is basically plagiarizing us.
[00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:53.969]  So that makes us superior to it.
[00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.892]  But humans can do incredible things or we can live down in the gutter.
[00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.336]  And that's why, for me, it's really important to understand that AI can't see a sunset.
[00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.217]  It can't appreciate
[00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:10.653]  The Rolling Stones or Beethoven, it can't appreciate your four-year-old playing Mary Had a Little Lamb on the piano.
[00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:15.035]  This is the human process, and the globalists say they want to replace humans.
[00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.877]  They say that we're obsolete because a machine can do it better.
[00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:22.600]  But it's not about what can, quote, do something better, what can build a building faster.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.843]  It's about the human experience, and this long, endless
[00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:39.428]  Mysterious compendium that we're part of the past present and future really the timelessness of just one moment expanding in the universe in God's consciousness giving us consciousness to experience that with God.
[00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:50.313]  So James Earl Jones spirit lives on here in the third dimension and of course he is a spirit that was inhabiting a body even the mathematics and science show that that our genetic form is just an imprint
[00:01:51.173 --> 00:02:13.327]  Or basically a body suit the spirit comes into, but our bodies themselves are a composite of all of our ancestors, and itself is its own composite colony creature, but it doesn't have a soul, but in a way it lives forever as well, as long as there's a human spirit, because it is a composite of all the humans that came before us to give us an owner's manual on this planet.
[00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:13.943]  All right.
[00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:35.317]  Darth Vader, we really appreciate your work and Godspeed and happy trails.
[00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:40.419]  I'll be covering this and a lot more tomorrow with the big debate between Kamala and Trump.
[00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.659]  It's going to be huge.
[00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.760]  Live coverage at nymfowars.com.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.340]  And Reluxe Jones on X. Thanks so much for watching.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.341]  And again, Vile Candidos, James Earl Jones.
[00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.842]  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.381]  I suggest we use it.
[00:02:55.022 --> 00:02:58.685]  Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
[00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.910]  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
[00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.734]  Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
[00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:17.203]  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen datatapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels' hidden fort.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.801]  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:29.323]  Enough of this.
[00:03:29.803 --> 00:03:30.903]  Vader, release him.
[00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:32.244]  As you wish.
[00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:35.046]  What is the answer to 1984?
[00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:35.766]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:54.016]  When you visit drjonesnaturals.com, you'll find amazing Brain Boost nootropics like Top Brain.
[00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:55.017]  It's incredible.
[00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:02.887]  But it still uses classical systems to stimulate the neurons in the brain and to give you energy.
[00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.810]  Next level foundational energy does not do that.
[00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:14.998]  It is the breakdown of folic acid into methylfolate mixed with other natural compounds that are known to push it into the cells.
[00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.843]  It then cleans up the mitochondria and allows more energy to be brought into the cell.
[00:04:20.483 --> 00:04:23.406]  You will feel dramatic energy when you take
[00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:25.947]  Next level foundational energy with no letdown.
[00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:35.053]  But if you are a European or Northern European, most of us have partially broken genes and cannot absorb folic acid or process it properly.
[00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:39.976]  If you have broken genes, you are going to feel explosive energy.
[00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:45.600]  So, be very, very, very careful when you first get Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.222]  It funds the operation.
[00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:48.563]  It's an amazing product.
[00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:50.364]  Everybody should experience it.
[00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:55.989]  It's discounted now, right now, and exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com.
