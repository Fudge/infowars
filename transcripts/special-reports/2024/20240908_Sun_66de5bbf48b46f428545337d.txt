[00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.111]  You really need to get off the talk radio format and get into a long-form podcast format, Sear.
[00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:14.634]  Trains of thought don't have to be broken by commercial breaks and you spend an hour pontificating on a point that you have to reintroduce each break.
[00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:21.017]  In my opinion, being a listener since Obama-ception woke me up, I'm forever grateful to you.
[00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:24.158]  I'm grateful for you and your support, you caring, you being involved.
[00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:24.438]  Okay.
[00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:30.334]  Here's the long and short of it, and I answer this question all the time, and it just needs to be answered over and over again.
[00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:34.055]  People watching on X are like, why are there ads every, you know, 15, 20 minutes?
[00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:34.875]  Well, what is this?
[00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:36.756]  Let me explain.
[00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:39.557]  Right now, you're not seeing ads, other than a quick little plug I did.
[00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:42.458]  We got to pay for the crew and everything we're doing here, plus the great products.
[00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.499]  I've been on the air for 30 years.
[00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.360]  I've been on talk radio for 29 years.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.721]  I've been syndicated for 27 and a half years.
[00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.122]  Most folks are getting their news from the internet now, but that can be heavily censored.
[00:00:55.402 --> 00:01:00.708]  When they took me off everything six years ago with the giant censorship, we were on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.029]  We've gotten even more now, over 350.
[00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:11.039]  And we were able to stay on air even though we only had Infowars.com and Bandop Video that we launched, and the radio stations.
[00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:11.940]  We still reach people.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.961]  We still got sponsorship.
[00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:13.742]  We still got support.
[00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.272]  And I had to sell the backup stuff I had that I always had nest egg to keep us operating, and we're down to nothing right now, so we're right on E, through these fights.
[00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:28.833]  That was the job to be a hard target, and to have diversity in old media and the newest media.
[00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:35.975]  So we've always been on the cutting edge of new ways to reach people with high tech, but we've also are old school AM and FM radio.
[00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.055]  And that's declined a lot, but it's still a substantive audience.
[00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:43.817]  So we don't run, for years, our personal network breaks most of the time.
[00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:45.587]  99% of the time.
[00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.149]  We run the local brakes that belong to local stations.
[00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:53.891]  You hear our ads on the national because we're just covering up their local brakes because that's not supposed to air on our system.
[00:01:54.191 --> 00:02:05.076]  That's why when you watch the NFL games, say, on Fox at home, you see national ads, then locally you see local ads with the car dealerships, or the restaurant, the steakhouse, or the gym, or the local telecom company.
[00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:08.834]  You're seeing local ads and you're seeing network ads.
[00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:10.315]  So we're old school media.
[00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.958]  I've been around a long time and that saved us.
[00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:19.122]  That said, I do all sorts of live shows and all sorts of live broadcasts multiple times a week.
[00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:24.006]  You're seeing one right now that don't do that and aren't that format and are the podcast format.
[00:02:27.477 --> 00:02:29.158]  Adam Curry was the first podcaster.
[00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:29.778]  He's on record.
[00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.780]  I came along the next six months of it.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.061]  So I'm one of the trailblazing podcasters.
[00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:40.545]  We had tens of millions of podcasters, subscribers when Apple knocked us off and deleted our systems and tried to block it, but it came back.
[00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:41.486]  That's how it's built to do.
[00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.247]  So I understand podcasting.
[00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:44.187]  Got Joe Rogan into it.
[00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:45.468]  One of the main guys that did that.
[00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:46.709]  Believe me, I know all about it.
[00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.790]  I'm one of the original OGs on that.
[00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:57.381]  If they're able to shut down InfoWars in the next two and a half months, then that's the, you know, date is mid-November to early December.
[00:02:57.581 --> 00:02:58.662]  I've already explained that last week.
[00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:00.283]  I'm going to re-explain it again.
[00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:03.766]  I say about 60% chance we'll stay on air, so cross your fingers.
[00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:12.473]  I will probably go to a direct podcast format while we rebuild through a new system.
[00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.154]  And I'll have to work with somebody else.
[00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:15.834]  That's how this works.
[00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:18.136]  They've got these undischargeable judgments and rigged courts.
[00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:22.718]  They can't stop me having a show with somebody else and they can't stop me, you know, getting my paycheck.
[00:03:22.738 --> 00:03:23.359]  They can't get that.
[00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.441]  They can try to grab it out of a bank, but they can't get it from the boss, from the company.
[00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:30.943]  And in phase one, we'll do a podcast and live reports and a bunch of stuff.
[00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:39.549]  And I've got unlimited interviews I can do, which I've not done as many because I'm busy on my own show, but I'll be on tons of shows right away and doing podcasts right away.
[00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.831]  And then we will reconstitute and at least produce something
[00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:54.613]  For talk radio, probably something like an hour a day show that's like a hard-hitting news program that's live and then sometimes is a compilation of the latest stuff we did.
[00:03:55.553 --> 00:04:00.015]  So we are going to move out of talk radio if they're able to shut us down.
[00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:03.817]  If they don't, then that's in the stars, what God wants.
[00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:09.380]  I will continue with the talk radio format, but we're probably gonna cut it to two hours next year
[00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:20.146]  And then do an hour of podcasting, pure, more, and then do more special reports and things, because those are definitely very effective at getting out on the show.
[00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:20.966]  Great question.
[00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:26.589]  You just got what's going on, but if it wasn't for Talk Radio and we're on some TV stations and cable stations, too, we wouldn't be here.
[00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.592]  That's why it's important to not just have big tech media, but remember, old-fashioned radio and TV didn't watch you.
[00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:34.253]  The internet now is two-way, baby.
[00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:38.837]  You should tune into UHF, VHF, or AMFM.
[00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:42.800]  If you didn't know what you were watching, I'd have you fill out diaries with Arbitron.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.261]  Now, these are great questions.
[00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:45.522]  It took me eight minutes to answer that one.
[00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:48.144]  But it's a really good question.
[00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:51.386]  All right, this is overhead shot, please.
[00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:58.452]  This is at... R... BiancoUS.
[00:04:58.492 --> 00:04:59.472]  I know I'm butchering these.
[00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:02.555]  R-B-I-A-N-C-O-U-S.
[00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:06.659]  Alex, RE the shooting, referencing that.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.323]  It's the media's fault for creating division.
[00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:14.806]  LGBTQ, please amplify this.
[00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:18.810]  Well, I wouldn't just agree with you because you said that, but I do agree with you.
[00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:25.777]  The mass shootings, they admit in criminology by hyping them up, giving a massive attention, it does make more lunatics try to do it.
[00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:27.138]  It's still very rare.
[00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:28.500]  They just hype the daylights out of it.
[00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:33.880]  You get 125, 130 people on average a year killed in mass shootings in schools.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.421]  Most of those are gang-related.
[00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:37.642]  They had, you know, Black on Black in Chicago.
[00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:39.003]  More people killed a few days ago.
[00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:40.404]  Didn't even hit the national news.
[00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:48.249]  But you get a white kid doing it, but the media wants to make an anti-gun, then they focus on it.
[00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.233]  In real, just, you know, indiscriminate, Harrison Kleibold-type
[00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:55.205]  Columbine shooting.
[00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:59.207]  It's less than 25 children die a year and teachers in schools.
[00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:03.830]  It's still too many, but it's a very rare occurrence out of 350 million people.
[00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:04.771]  All right?
[00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.093]  So we have that information.
[00:06:08.113 --> 00:06:10.755]  And yes, I don't hate all the LGBT people.
[00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:13.317]  A lot of them, you know, gays against groomers are not pedophiles.
[00:06:13.977 --> 00:06:23.804]  The globalists have seized on it as a way to promote pedophilia and anti-family garbage and have tried to make the rainbow flag their new religion, to try to basically take over national sovereignty and attack the church.
[00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:25.589]  So it's a cult.
[00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.690]  Sex cult.
[00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.993]  This is MagaOperator on X. At MagaOperator.
[00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:32.514]  What about Mug Club?
[00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:36.716]  I've had the feds and the globals for 10 weeks trying to shut us down.
[00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:38.277]  Attacking us from every angle.
[00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:42.380]  I am going to start doing more MugPug reports for folks.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.621]  I apologize about that.
[00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:45.181]  And I am going to start doing more stuff for subscribers.
[00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.162]  So, here you go.
[00:06:47.843 --> 00:06:51.746]  Also, he went on to say, I was enjoying your Crowder appearances and Alex Jones 2.0 movie reviews.
[00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:53.287]  We're going to bring it back, brother.
[00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:53.567]  Thank you.
[00:06:54.332 --> 00:06:57.775]  This is at liberalgenius54.
[00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:02.638]  Can you do a random Alex Jones roar at the end of the stream?
[00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.242]  You know, how about I just do it now, because I'll probably forget to do it by the end of the stream.
[00:07:07.262 --> 00:07:09.844]  People ask why my voice is so hoarse.
[00:07:09.884 --> 00:07:11.985]  I never took acting lessons or voice lessons.
[00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:14.367]  I've screamed and yelled a lot, even without a bullhorn.
[00:07:15.148 --> 00:07:17.870]  And so I've got stuff on my larynx, polyps.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.423]  I've been to an ear, nose, and eye doctor a couple times, and they said, well, it'll take six weeks.
[00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.244]  You can't really talk.
[00:07:24.804 --> 00:07:29.447]  You can take those polyps off, and you won't sound like you're an 80-year-old man who smokes cigarettes and drinks whiskey.
[00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:32.249]  But I just haven't done it, and it's kind of signature, so I'm leaving it there.
[00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.231]  I may have to do it at some point if I keep screaming, because it's getting worse.
[00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:39.622]  Um, but I used to scream so loud at demonstrations and stuff that I'd cough up blood.
[00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:41.223]  A few times.
[00:07:41.903 --> 00:07:43.244]  So, uh, I like to do it.
[00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:46.225]  I usually do it when I actually feel like doing it, but I'm excited about it.
[00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:48.806]  You know, the country and the world waking up, so let me fire it up and do it.
[00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:53.988]  There, that's a little one for you.
[00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:55.829]  All right.
[00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.510]  Cause you are the folks that everybody that care the most.
[00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.011]  You're the people that are subscribing over at Realog Showrooms.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.701]  All right.
[00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:11.703]  Modern Warfare with Alex Jones at Alex Jones, MW3.
[00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:12.964]  Know those folks.
[00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:16.245]  Can you interview your mom and dad on InfoWars someday?
[00:08:18.126 --> 00:08:19.406]  My parents are very private.
[00:08:23.188 --> 00:08:27.529]  But I do feel like, because they're getting older, that I should interview them soon.
[00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:28.870]  So tell you what.
[00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:36.761]  They don't want to be on camera, but I'll try to do an audio interview with both of them in the near future just for you, because I've already been thinking about that.
[00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:37.301]  That's a great idea.
[00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:39.041]  All right.
[00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:44.163]  Western Invasion at Western Invasion asks, what do you think the solution is for the Great Replacement could be?
[00:08:44.664 --> 00:08:47.645]  Europe and the UK is rife, as you already know.
[00:08:48.565 --> 00:08:50.306]  It doesn't get better.
[00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:51.586]  It only gets worse.
[00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:52.567]  How does it end?
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.062]  We got 40 million illegals in the last 15 years, conservatively.
[00:08:58.082 --> 00:09:00.444]  It's over 20 million just since Biden got in.
[00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:01.844]  It's accelerated exponentially.
[00:09:01.884 --> 00:09:05.266]  I mean, Trump got shot when he was showing that graph.
[00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:09.689]  Guys, pull up the graph that Trump was reading when he got shot.
[00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:11.029]  It'll come up.
[00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:11.730]  Here's Obama.
[00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.072]  And here's illegal immigration here.
[00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:17.573]  And then Trump gets in.
[00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:20.543]  And it goes like this.
[00:09:22.384 --> 00:09:23.785]  And then Biden gets in.
[00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:25.927]  And it goes like this.
[00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:27.929]  So that's basically the graph.
[00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.190]  So Obama's here.
[00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:31.091]  Trump gets in.
[00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:31.872]  It goes like that.
[00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:33.413]  Biden gets in.
[00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.514]  Of course, it hasn't gone down yet.
[00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:36.355]  It's just like up here.
[00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:39.258]  So yeah, there it is.
[00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:39.378]  See?
[00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.833]  So you see Obama right there, and then Trump gets in, and he goes, boom.
[00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:49.615]  So, half of that 40 million's come in in just the last three and a half, four years.
[00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:53.556]  And so that's a question that would take hours to answer.
[00:09:54.196 --> 00:09:59.058]  We have to culturally, with the people that are here, wake them up to the new world order, and that's starting to happen.
[00:09:59.538 --> 00:10:01.338]  But it's hard when it's first generation folks.
[00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:02.279]  It just takes two or three.
[00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.900]  That's why black folks now are going with Trump, Hispanics are going with Trump.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.621]  They've had generations now to actually figure out what's going on.
[00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:09.621]  It takes that for anybody.
[00:10:11.204 --> 00:10:13.985]  And then we have to shut off the open borders.
[00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:17.546]  We have to deport the military age men and the military people that are here.
[00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:21.208]  And we got to prosecute people for the human trafficking.
[00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:23.449]  And Europe's got to do the same thing.
[00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:27.450]  And then we've got to stop bowing to the illegals.
[00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.851]  We've got to cut off them getting all these freebies that nobody else gets.
[00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:31.472]  That's the magnet and the incentive.
[00:10:32.392 --> 00:10:34.793]  And so we're already pretty screwed.
[00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:40.115]  But there's the other converse where
[00:10:43.192 --> 00:10:53.179]  50% of black males are going to vote Trump, 50% of Hispanic males in most polls, triple the Hispanic females, triple the black females, something like 30%.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:03.606]  So there's a trend as things get bad and bad and worse that people kind of figure it out real quick, even if they are first generation or second.
[00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:16.464]  The Democrats, though, right now want more illegals in because even if they're not voting right away, which a lot of them are, they give them more congressional apportionment for more blue seats in those districts that are created.
[00:11:17.725 --> 00:11:19.326]  So that's why they're doing it, and Democrats have admitted that.
[00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:32.117]  Court Jester at NY1SRED asked the question, I'd just like to know what keeps you motivated on a daily basis.
[00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:41.749]  Well, that's a really good question, and it's a lot of things, but I've always had a sense of wanting to fight tyrants and wanting to promote freedom.
[00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:45.290]  And I also have an instinctive and spiritual need to not lay down.
[00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:50.792]  And so I never really ran from fights, I always ran towards them, which is just an instinctive thing.
[00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:56.754]  And I like to fight, politically, culturally, physically, if I have to.
[00:11:57.094 --> 00:11:58.095]  Once it starts, I enjoy it.
[00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:01.756]  And I just don't roll over.
[00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:05.059]  And I realize things are much worse if we do roll over and grovel.
[00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:08.122]  Plus, it doesn't feel good to serve evil, even when I've entertained it.
[00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:09.183]  Not consciously.
[00:12:09.403 --> 00:12:11.506]  Not like I was actually entertaining it, but I've war-gamed it.
[00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:13.027]  And it just feels terrible.
[00:12:13.047 --> 00:12:15.590]  And it feels like God's removing his presence from me.
[00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.751]  Even entertain it.
[00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:19.127]  In the war game.
[00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:21.488]  Not actually entertaining, but like, what would that be like?
[00:12:22.248 --> 00:12:24.009]  And I've been around some globalists.
[00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:27.630]  They try to get me to sell out and it feels really cold and like failure.
[00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.530]  It doesn't make me feel good.
[00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:30.751]  It feels good to stand with God.
[00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.791]  It feels good to fight evil.
[00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:32.872]  It feels good to have courage.
[00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.772]  It feels good to get to know all you people.
[00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:36.773]  I mean, I meet our listeners and supporters.
[00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:39.134]  They could be Hispanic, black, white, Asian, old, young.
[00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:40.997]  And they have electricity in their eyes.
[00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:43.303]  They're alive, they're informed, they're loving, they're caring.
[00:12:43.684 --> 00:12:49.557]  I see leftists, they look like zombies that some demonic spider drank their essence out, or Skeksi in the Dark Crystal.
[00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.572]  So to me, it just feels right.
[00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.933]  Plus it's intellectually right and spiritually right.
[00:12:56.773 --> 00:12:58.194]  And so that's what keeps me going.
[00:12:58.874 --> 00:12:59.975]  I'm my own worst enemy.
[00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:03.276]  And I get up here and say, take all these supplements and do all this stuff.
[00:13:03.976 --> 00:13:05.937]  And then I'll look around and go, wait, it's been six months.
[00:13:05.997 --> 00:13:06.997]  I was never a supplement guy.
[00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:07.617]  I know they work.
[00:13:07.998 --> 00:13:08.998]  I know people want them.
[00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:10.739]  I know it's one of the fastest growing industries.
[00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:12.859]  I've had sponsors for almost 30 years that do it.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.340]  And I never religiously take it.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.561]  I'll finally start taking it.
[00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:18.222]  I'll finally start drinking more water.
[00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:19.082]  I'll finally start, you know,
[00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:22.363]  Even without extra exercise, because I always do some exercise.
[00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:27.784]  I'm doing the same amount of exercise I was doing two months ago, but I'm religiously now.
[00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:31.665]  Got the little pill containers out, taking them, doing the green drink, all that.
[00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:34.046]  Taking the X2 every day, X3.
[00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:40.127]  And I've lost 13 pounds since I started doing this religiously about a month and a half ago, really.
[00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:44.028]  And everybody goes, man, you look better, your skin is just like, yeah, I'm actually doing what I say.
[00:13:46.303 --> 00:13:48.784]  So, I'm my own worst enemy.
[00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:51.985]  And so, that's what keeps me going.
[00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:53.366]  All right, great question.
[00:13:54.286 --> 00:13:56.287]  The questions get more political and stuff here now.
[00:13:57.567 --> 00:14:02.029]  Mr. Informed at Real Mr. Informed on X will show their question.
[00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:06.550]  Ask the question, long time listener and love the show.
[00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.372]  What is your advice to those who are just now waking up to see the system for what it is?
[00:14:14.523 --> 00:14:22.092]  Uh, it can be overwhelming at first, depending on your psychological makeup and spiritual makeup and historical, you know, how you were raised.
[00:14:23.974 --> 00:14:28.139]  So that's another huge question for the ages, but know that God's in control.
[00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:33.384]  No, you're part of a timeless continuum of consciousness that God created.
[00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:37.047]  Thank God for the gift of consciousness, and ask God to lead God and direct you.
[00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:40.950]  And don't feel overwhelmed that you've personally got to defeat this.
[00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:53.841]  You've just got to make the right spiritual, cultural, economic decisions, or at least try, and God sees that, and then God will finish taking you across the chasm.
[00:14:53.861 --> 00:14:54.862]  It's that experience.
[00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:59.298]  And then help others, reach out to others, and get more informed.
[00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:05.782]  Learn to trust but verify, as Ronald Reagan said.
[00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:11.626]  There's just thousands of other points on that front.
[00:15:12.167 --> 00:15:13.168]  Don't get blackpilled.
[00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:15.743]  Because that's not going to help you.
[00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:18.085]  We really are powerful creatures God made.
[00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:21.427]  And look how far we've come from 30 years ago.
[00:15:21.508 --> 00:15:22.889]  Maybe 1% of people knew about this.
[00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:25.310]  I'd say 30, 40% are pretty much awake now.
[00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:26.791]  Half are somewhat awake.
[00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:31.995]  I mean, 40% of people now support and trust the medical system.
[00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:35.718]  Just four years ago, it was in the 90s to the 80s to the 70s, depending on the poll.
[00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:37.459]  I mean, people are waking up.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.201]  And at first they don't trust.
[00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.281]  Now they know they're being lied to.
[00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:41.082]  Now they research.
[00:15:41.402 --> 00:15:42.043]  It's a process.
[00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:49.100]  He went on to say.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.565]  I know there are a lot of them, and it's important to remember there are new listeners every day to help guide them in a positive direction.
[00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:56.165]  Yeah.
[00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:58.147]  I've got a blind spot.
[00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:03.171]  I've talked about It's not a great question where I've been on there 30 years.
[00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.613]  I've been reading and researching for 40 literally since I was 10 years old.
[00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.236]  Reading adult history.
[00:16:11.217 --> 00:16:14.580]  Military information is always kind of fascinating because it was it was the real world.
[00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:15.821]  And
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:33.413]  I've covered 9-11 and made four or five films and written books on it and done hundreds of marches, and I did it so much that about ten years ago, I was like, man, I've been doing this for, you know, over a decade, and I still cover it some, but it's important to remember that.
[00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:35.375]  It's important to remember how fluoride got in the water.
[00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:37.276]  It's important to understand the private Federal Reserve.
[00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:38.637]  It's important to understand basic history.
[00:16:39.258 --> 00:16:40.559]  That's why I've made films like Endgame.
[00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:44.262]  Two and a half hours gives you a pretty good basic education on how stuff works.
[00:16:45.845 --> 00:16:49.627]  But it is important to revisit the basics, and I think that's a great point.
[00:16:51.688 --> 00:17:06.135]  Also, at TJ Carson, or TJ, at TJ Caron, 1735, is there anything else I can do to get involved in InfoWars to keep up the fight?
[00:17:08.997 --> 00:17:11.298]  I mean, take clips out yourself, post them on X,
[00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:13.820]  Post them everywhere else you can.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.381]  Send them out in emails, text messages.
[00:17:17.043 --> 00:17:17.884]  Start your own show.
[00:17:18.064 --> 00:17:19.145]  Might get 100 viewers, might get 1,000.
[00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:23.188]  These globalists go around and talk to 1,000 people or 100 people.
[00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.170]  I mean, every little bit helps.
[00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.292]  Support the broadcast.
[00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.033]  Spread the word about it.
[00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:30.095]  Support other broadcasts that are telling the truth.
[00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:32.517]  Pray for the broadcast.
[00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:35.159]  Pray for the global awakening.
[00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.042]  I mean, get other people to vote.
[00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:40.864]  Continue to educate your friends and family.
[00:17:40.884 --> 00:17:41.764]  Don't get frustrated with them.
[00:17:41.784 --> 00:17:44.185]  Just continue to lovingly inform them.
[00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.886]  These questions are all so good, I could talk for an hour on each question.
[00:17:48.247 --> 00:17:55.390]  Let's talk to Wes at RealJWAH310.
[00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.311]  How close are we to World War III?
[00:17:58.371 --> 00:18:03.633]  It seems to have nightmares about going through nuclear holocaust.
[00:18:06.069 --> 00:18:07.069]  How close are we to WW3?
[00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:10.110]  I seem to have nightmares about going through nuclear holocaust.
[00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.451]  I hope we don't get to that precipice.
[00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:13.932]  Okay.
[00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.732]  I mean, there's a million ways to look at this.
[00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.973]  It's another incredibly huge question.
[00:18:18.853 --> 00:18:22.275]  These are all just too good and too big and too timeless and too expansive.
[00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:31.258]  We're already in World War III and we're going into World War IV if you want to get CIA reincorporation technical.
[00:18:31.872 --> 00:18:56.916]  Now I'll get on air and say we're in danger of World War III because the general public knows what that means, but the CIA and the Russians and the Chinese and their military handbooks and their military histories call the Cold War starting in 1946 right through the Afghan withdrawal
[00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:00.300]  They call that World War III.
[00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:05.186]  Asymmetrical, proxy wars, economic wars, hack awards.
[00:19:06.147 --> 00:19:12.034]  And then now World War IV is what they say we're in danger of having, which is total thermonuclear trench warfare.
[00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:14.232]  Absolute destruction.
[00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:25.800]  Whether you call it World War III or IV, we're on the precipice of a full-blown new global war, meaning war all over the major continents and every major country somehow involved.
[00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:33.866]  Wars going on in three or more theaters, with major powers lined up against each other, different axes.
[00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:41.972]  And so, the danger of this proxy war, hybrid war, in the Middle East and in
[00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:50.601]  What's happening in Europe, in Ukraine, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus.
[00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:59.732]  On the RAND Corporation threat escalation ladder, we're moving very quickly with Ukraine a month ago invading.
[00:20:00.785 --> 00:20:08.628]  Russia and all the rest of it and blowing up North Stream pipelines and all this into tactical nuclear weapons being used and you're off the races.
[00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.649]  And the Ukrainians are always trying to blow up nuclear reactors and emitting it.
[00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.269]  I mean, they are out of control.
[00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:14.990]  But that's the deep state running them.
[00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.971]  So NATO is putting out propaganda now about nuclear war survival.
[00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:20.812]  It's no big deal.
[00:20:20.892 --> 00:20:22.012]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[00:20:23.692 --> 00:20:26.455]  So, we're in the beginnings of World War IV.
[00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:32.101]  If you use the establishment's internal, they're not even secret, but it's more academic definitions.
[00:20:33.243 --> 00:20:35.085]  You can research everything I'm saying, you'll find it to be true.
[00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:37.127]  I mean, I'll just say this stuff.
[00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:38.589]  All right?
[00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:39.650]  Okay, let's move on here.
[00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.591]  Great question.
[00:20:42.054 --> 00:20:50.104]  Info Uncensored at Info Uncensored on X. If money was no object at all, and you had a gazillion million dollars, what would you do?
[00:20:50.845 --> 00:20:55.931]  What keeps you actually going on in life, Alex, other than the obvious answers like your kids, your faith in God?
[00:20:56.451 --> 00:20:58.213]  What's the driving force beyond all of that?
[00:20:58.354 --> 00:20:59.134]  I mean, it's God.
[00:20:59.195 --> 00:21:00.837]  I mean, this is the test.
[00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:04.709]  of good versus evil and to see who you are.
[00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:05.970]  You're an eternal spirit.
[00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:17.396]  It's been mathematically and scientifically proven that we interconnect with higher dimensions, that our cells are just a colony creature resonating electrochemically as a transceiver, receiving and transceiving.
[00:21:18.497 --> 00:21:24.540]  And we are part of the timeless energy of God, that he's focused down into a new being with free will.
[00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:26.281]  And
[00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:35.269]  If I had a gazillion dollars, I would do what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:39.552]  is doing, exposing the war on children, how they're purposely being poisoned and sterilized.
[00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:44.074]  I would file giant lawsuits against Bill Gates and all the globalists.
[00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:49.678]  I would use the money against Soros, which has taken over roughly half the DAs in the country and most of the major cities.
[00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:53.520]  I would just have a huge educational program that humans are good.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:59.484]  I would also free up all the new free energy
[00:22:00.891 --> 00:22:12.560]  I say new, they're 30, 40 years old, many of them that are there, and really empower humanity and be totally honest with people about our real potential, but also the incredible danger of these advanced technologies as weapons could destroy us.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.325]  And that's the globalist answer to depopulating and dumbing people down and suppressing technology is, this will get out of hand, we'll destroy ourselves, but they're already doing that.
[00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:29.813]  I believe honesty is the way to go, and then say, you know, have global votes or national votes, and if the nations want to vote, the people will then have a referendum on, we're outlawing this technology here on Earth,
[00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:42.282]  Uh, but if you want to go out of the asteroid belt and do it, or you want to form a colony and do it, you know, I, I mean, I really see that type of, uh, liberalization, not the modern term, but the real term.
[00:22:42.303 --> 00:22:45.445]  And that's a very complex question that can go on for effect.
[00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:46.165]  I love these questions.
[00:22:46.185 --> 00:22:47.747]  I may do whole shows just on each question.
[00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:50.208]  So that's an excellent question.
[00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.731]  Tippy top.
[00:22:55.092 --> 00:22:56.273]  And you can find them at get.
[00:22:59.116 --> 00:23:00.897]  I know people have these long handles.
[00:23:00.957 --> 00:23:02.298]  I just can't figure these out.
[00:23:02.678 --> 00:23:03.799]  Great handle, I just can't figure it out.
[00:23:03.859 --> 00:23:10.262]  It's a Getchapelblkth, right there.
[00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:14.565]  It says, was there an ancient civilization on Mars that got wiped out?
[00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.105]  How did they get wiped out?
[00:23:16.346 --> 00:23:20.748]  I like that question, because I can actually pretty much answer your question to a great extent.
[00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:27.532]  So when I saw those questions this morning, I had the crew, I just told them, real simple,
[00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:41.193]  Just like I say stuff on air, and the crew does a great job, I just said, type in, evidence of nuclear war on Mars, or scientists believe nuclear war happened on Mars.
[00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:42.114]  Now, let me show you.
[00:23:43.214 --> 00:23:58.786]  Because they know it's on Mars, they've sent probes, they know that there's nothing there that would actually cause these isotopes, unless there were hydrogen bombs detonated on a scale like you would see if 50,000 huge ones were detonated.
[00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:01.697]  That's just a paraphrase, quick to stall.
[00:24:03.058 --> 00:24:04.079]  You can read the actual studies.
[00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.800]  So this is from Harvard.
[00:24:08.002 --> 00:24:17.708]  Evidence of massive thermonuclear explosions on Mars in the past, the Sidonian hypothesis, and Fermi's paradox.
[00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:20.811]  Brandenburg.
[00:24:21.551 --> 00:24:22.572]  Here's another one, Fox News.
[00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:25.294]  Was there a nuclear blast on Mars?
[00:24:27.435 --> 00:24:29.315]  Here's the Epoch Times.
[00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:32.816]  Evidence of an ancient nuclear explosion on Mars, says scientists.
[00:24:34.456 --> 00:24:35.097]  Smithsonian.
[00:24:35.877 --> 00:24:36.397]  Intriguing.
[00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:41.058]  Carbon isotopes on Mars could be from cosmic dust, UV radiation, or ancient life.
[00:24:42.638 --> 00:24:45.419]  But where did all that nuclear explosion stuff come from?
[00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.079]  Nuclear alien space wars.
[00:24:48.139 --> 00:24:48.999]  A Martian theory.
[00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:49.920]  Alright.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.201]  So your question was... Very good question.
[00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.917]  Was there an ancient civilization on Mars that got wiped out?
[00:25:00.037 --> 00:25:01.218]  How did they get wiped out?
[00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:05.822]  I don't know the answer to that, but there are a lot of structures that look man-made.
[00:25:07.463 --> 00:25:10.726]  There is evidence that they have ice caps in the northern and southern pole.
[00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:17.732]  There is massive evidence that it was once water there, but their atmosphere, because their gravity being lower, was not strong enough.
[00:25:18.673 --> 00:25:24.538]  I say there, whatever was on the planet, that they've taken shots of fossils that look like single-cell organisms.
[00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.791]  But we get lied to so much, who knows?
[00:25:29.832 --> 00:25:38.518]  But they do find the isotope for xenon-129 that is in giant hydrogen explosions.
[00:25:39.178 --> 00:25:41.480]  And it's a level so high, they believe it couldn't be other things.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.680]  It would be lower than that.
[00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:45.042]  Very, very interesting.
[00:25:45.883 --> 00:25:49.365]  Whether they had a civilization, or maybe our ancestors came from there, who knows?
[00:25:51.687 --> 00:25:53.488]  And then escaped to Earth, or vice versa.
[00:25:54.738 --> 00:25:59.740]  Whether Atlantis existed, they had some secret technology that blew up their island and darkened the skies for years and all the rest of it.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.141]  We now have all that.
[00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:07.383]  So whether that happened on Mars or not, we could be where they're at, or were at, or possibly were, very soon.
[00:26:08.444 --> 00:26:11.305]  Excellente question.
[00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:17.707]  All right, let's now move on to the next question.
[00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:20.808]  We do so much preparation for the show.
[00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:21.889]  I got so many notes here.
[00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:24.350]  We're teleprompter free, but I do go to these so I can
[00:26:25.094 --> 00:26:26.315]  I'll obviously be accurate here.
[00:26:28.637 --> 00:26:34.603]  Here's a Say Yes to the Truth at Say Yes to the Truth on X. See how easy that handle was?
[00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:46.654]  Why aren't these evil people committing... Why aren't these evil people committing crimes against humanity, getting arrested by those who swore an oath to defend the country against enemies, foreign and domestic?
[00:26:48.439 --> 00:26:49.740]  Is this oath meaningless?
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:57.244]  Could you share how we can make crimes too big to arrest into, yep, that's a crime.
[00:26:58.005 --> 00:26:58.925]  Let's arrest them all.
[00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:00.166]  What a great question.
[00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.386]  I mean, I'm not just kissing your ass.
[00:27:02.027 --> 00:27:05.689]  Every one of these questions has been just amazing.
[00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.373]  And I had a feeling they would because we get a lot of good questions from general folks at InfoWars and general callers and
[00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:19.078]  Comments and questions just on Real Alex Jones, but man, subscribers are the folks that care the most, and it's the best questions.
[00:27:19.358 --> 00:27:20.479]  Every damn one of these is excellent.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:32.146]  That is such a huge question... ...that it makes my head spin.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.060]  Let me do this.
[00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:37.062]  I've been going for 42 minutes.
[00:27:37.742 --> 00:27:44.147]  It's not that I need a break, but I don't want to just say something here, because what happens is I just had a couple thoughts, and I looked at the paper, and I couldn't remember them.
[00:27:44.587 --> 00:27:45.828]  So I'm going to air a special report.
[00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:51.512]  I didn't used to be OCD, but now, when I have a great thought, I can't remember it, I go crazy.
[00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:53.173]  You see me be a jerk to the crew sometimes.
[00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:53.914]  It has nothing to do with them.
[00:27:54.574 --> 00:27:54.894]  I don't know.
[00:28:13.956 --> 00:28:16.999]  You know, it's in the spike protein hurt everybody just in the natural cover as well.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:24.205]  But I just have a great thought and then it's there and then it's it'll come right back in a moment, but not while I'm babbling.
[00:28:24.846 --> 00:28:31.972]  So let's air one of the new excellent Greg Reese reports.
[00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:33.093]  Let's air 22 SB 22.
[00:28:36.479 --> 00:28:38.660]  Greece, Venezuelan gang sent to America by design.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.640]  What an important report.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.481]  Too bad it only got 200,000 viewers on AXS yesterday and about 50,000 on InfoWars.
[00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:45.921]  His report's seen a million views.
[00:28:45.941 --> 00:28:46.882]  I mean, if we're going to win the war.
[00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:49.022]  So here's that little five-minute report.
[00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:55.924]  And then I will come back with this question that basically has smoke coming out of my ears.
[00:28:56.004 --> 00:28:57.945]  It's kind of like Robbie the Robot when he gets too many questions.
[00:28:57.965 --> 00:29:00.285]  He goes, processing, processing, cannot compute.
[00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:01.806]  Not because it's a bad question.
[00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:02.386]  It's so
[00:29:03.587 --> 00:29:04.409]  Oh, it just came back to me.
[00:29:04.449 --> 00:29:05.110]  It's coming back now.
[00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:08.335]  We'll play the report and I will return.
[00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:08.656]  Here we go.
[00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:25.472]  It is being reported that the Venezuelan gang Trende Aragua began taking control of apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado last November.
[00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:29.954]  While mainstream media and government ignore it, local news is covering it.
[00:29:30.274 --> 00:29:39.698]  So now your investigator Brian Moss has obtained a confidential report into one of those apartment complexes and that report says a Venezuelan gang began taking it over in 2023
[00:29:40.959 --> 00:29:42.540]  This is the nine-page report.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.782]  It was put together by a Denver law firm.
[00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:49.666]  They say they were hired to look into the Whispering Pines apartments by the building's lenders.
[00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:55.050]  Last month, they sent this report to Aurora's mayor, city manager, and police chief.
[00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:04.897]  As recently as Tuesday, residents at the Edge apartment complex in Aurora pushed back on reports that a Venezuelan gang had taken over their building.
[00:30:05.198 --> 00:30:10.322]  But five miles away, at the Whispering Pines, a 54-unit apartment building in Aurora,
[00:30:11.002 --> 00:30:17.208]  This detailed letter asking for confidential treatment of the contents shared a different story.
[00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:30.721]  It was sent to Aurora officials on August 9th with the investigators saying the evidence we have reviewed indicates that gang members are engaging in flagrant trespass violations, assaults and battery, human trafficking,
[00:30:31.201 --> 00:30:37.183]  Sexual abuse of minors, unlawful firearms possession, extortion, and other criminal activities.
[00:30:37.623 --> 00:30:49.687]  According to the law firm's report, the Venezuelan gang Trande Aragua has threatened to kill, and in certain instances has apparently actively attempted to kill, members of Whispering Pines Management.
[00:30:49.927 --> 00:30:58.090]  The report says a consultant for the property management company was severely beaten and stomped by gang members and was hospitalized.
[00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:03.956]  The alleged incident recorded by building cameras with screenshots attached to the letter.
[00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:13.986]  The report relies on a property manager who said that gang members allegedly stabbed a Whispering Pines resident for refusing to pay rent to the gang.
[00:31:14.607 --> 00:31:18.611]  He also told the investigators the takeover began last November.
[00:31:19.272 --> 00:31:28.500]  The report recounts that this summer, the gang approached the property manager and told him they would help him out in exchange for half of all the rent that he collected.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.183]  The law firm that wrote the report called that an organized crime tactic.
[00:31:33.764 --> 00:31:36.886]  The gang members then allegedly took over vacant apartments.
[00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:42.131]  According to the document, moved families into those units and started collecting rent.
[00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:51.335]  The law firm says this is a picture of gang members breaking into a vacant apartment so they could move a Venezuelan family in and then collect rent.
[00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:55.097]  This is our business plan, one gang member told a housekeeper.
[00:31:55.597 --> 00:31:59.859]  If he, the property manager, doesn't like it, we'll fill him with bullets.
[00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:05.562]  There are reports of this Venezuelan gang in Colorado, Illinois, and Texas.
[00:32:05.942 --> 00:32:10.829]  And according to a recent Dr. Phil interview with retired Special Agent with U.S.
[00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:14.594]  Immigration, Victor Avila, this is all being done by design.
[00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:19.340]  Venezuela, by the way, has the lowest murder rate ever, right now.
[00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:20.542]  What does that tell you?
[00:32:21.223 --> 00:32:22.624]  Yeah, all the murderers are gone.
[00:32:22.645 --> 00:32:23.265]  They're here!
[00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:24.142]  Yeah.
[00:32:24.623 --> 00:32:27.625]  So, is it true that they're emptying prisons?
[00:32:27.965 --> 00:32:30.747]  I mean, is this Cuba all over again?
[00:32:30.847 --> 00:32:32.168]  This is not a hearsay.
[00:32:32.488 --> 00:32:46.718]  There was a memo by DHS last year admitting that, in fact, they knew that Venezuela's government was emptying their prison and rehabilitation centers or drug centers, releasing them on purpose.
[00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:51.282]  Because they knew, with instructions, if you were going to get out, you were going to make your way to the U.S.
[00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:52.583]  That is not
[00:32:53.223 --> 00:32:54.144]  We're not making that up.
[00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:55.665]  That's true.
[00:32:56.025 --> 00:33:00.128]  It was reported on and DHS admitted that that was happening, and in fact it has.
[00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:03.291]  El Tren de Aragua is heavily present in our country now.
[00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:18.982]  Okay, so you're telling me that DHS has acknowledged that Venezuela, for example, is emptying their prisons and their rehabilitation centers with the understanding you get out if you leave here and go to the United States?
[00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:19.483]  Yes.
[00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:32.111]  And DHS has, in writing, said, we know that's happening, we know they're coming here, we're processing them in, and have no idea where they are.
[00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:33.112]  Correct.
[00:33:33.852 --> 00:33:35.093]  How many people are we talking about?
[00:33:35.374 --> 00:33:35.734]  Millions.
[00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:38.196]  And just Venezuela alone.
[00:33:38.956 --> 00:33:41.438]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:33:43.843 --> 00:33:45.704]  All right, so that's very important, obviously.
[00:33:45.824 --> 00:33:50.385]  Now, let me reread the question, and I'm going to answer it as best I can in limited time.
[00:33:52.866 --> 00:34:00.348]  Why aren't these evil people committing crimes against humanity getting arrested by those who swore an oath to defend the country against enemies, foreign or domestic?
[00:34:01.668 --> 00:34:02.668]  Is this oath meaningless?
[00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:11.051]  Could you share how we make crimes too big to arrest into, yep, that's a crime, let's arrest them?
[00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:14.664]  All right, excellent question.
[00:34:14.704 --> 00:34:15.725]  Let me give you the quick answer.
[00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:18.306]  For the U.S., and it's similar around the Western world.
[00:34:18.326 --> 00:34:33.651]  I've had a lot of big expert politicos on recently, and they've explained, and I've explained, the way the U.S.
[00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:39.993]  is set up now, the head of the Department of Justice, Merrick Garland, is more powerful than the president.
[00:34:42.091 --> 00:34:44.452]  Under the laws they've gotten passed, it'd be repealed.
[00:34:45.673 --> 00:34:49.475]  The Inspector General's there as well, they set up in the 70s, after Watergate.
[00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:51.637]  They're in control of all the agencies.
[00:34:52.397 --> 00:35:03.444]  And so, I've interviewed federal judges, off record, others, it's in the news, that he will not prosecute child traffickers, convicted murderers, you name it, when they come across, they just let them go.
[00:35:03.944 --> 00:35:06.365]  You see the Sanctuary City Police saying, we let murderers go.
[00:35:06.686 --> 00:35:08.126]  Played the clip Friday, yesterday.
[00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:10.148]  And so,
[00:35:11.474 --> 00:35:15.996]  They won't let the judges and the grand juries even seek indictments.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.817]  It's in the law.
[00:35:17.837 --> 00:35:19.798]  They can hold them for one month and they cross illegally.
[00:35:19.818 --> 00:35:20.178]  That's it.
[00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:24.981]  She'll have a guy that's been convicted four times of raping kids in Guatemala, Mexico, and the U.S.
[00:35:25.441 --> 00:35:26.501]  They catch him driving a school bus.
[00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:30.283]  There's a real case in South Texas that I covered that the judge told me about.
[00:35:30.303 --> 00:35:30.903]  I went and looked it up.
[00:35:31.183 --> 00:35:32.064]  It was in her court.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.402]  And he was ordered released by Merrick Garland.
[00:35:36.802 --> 00:35:39.544]  And the federal marshals and the good FBI agents are totally upset about this.
[00:35:39.884 --> 00:35:42.605]  Their hands are tied, just like the Border Patrol's order to facilitate the smuggling.
[00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:43.226]  They don't like it either.
[00:35:43.466 --> 00:35:45.087]  That's why their union's come out and exposed it.
[00:35:45.107 --> 00:35:52.251]  I think they should just stand down and let it all build up, but needing Congress to cut off all the freebies they give them, that'll stop it as well.
[00:35:52.271 --> 00:35:53.392]  They advertised to come here.
[00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:56.073]  Biden said, when I become president, immediately surge the border.
[00:35:57.514 --> 00:35:58.115]  I want you to come.
[00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.987]  So yes, it's too big to arrest.
[00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:03.028]  Like, too big to fail.
[00:36:03.608 --> 00:36:04.629]  Too big to charge.
[00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.775]  And my dad always, he explained to me, he said, the big crooks run the system, he goes, they're gonna steal big.
[00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:11.516]  And he wasn't telling me to steal, he was saying steal.
[00:36:12.057 --> 00:36:13.859]  He said, if you're gonna steal, steal big.
[00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:19.845]  And he wasn't telling me to do that, he was saying that's their rule.
[00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:22.147]  Because then they're protected.
[00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:23.849]  So...
[00:36:25.305 --> 00:36:29.728]  You've got criminal groups in the bureaucracy and the corporations that have gotten away with more and more and more.
[00:36:30.008 --> 00:36:31.469]  They're generationally handing down power.
[00:36:31.509 --> 00:36:32.309]  They're very arrogant.
[00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:37.413]  They're full of hubris and chutzpah and bravado and everything else.
[00:36:38.694 --> 00:36:40.054]  And they believe they're above the law.
[00:36:40.134 --> 00:36:48.300]  That's why you see Strzok in there making those weird, crazy faces he made when he was being exposed for lying to Congress and looking at him like a demon and smiling and baring his teeth.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.141]  They believe they've got the country.
[00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:55.246]  And so the average person that's sworn a note, they're compartmentalized and they don't see through walls.
[00:36:55.286 --> 00:36:59.407]  They don't see what's compartmentalized by the Department of Justice or the Defense Department.
[00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:01.989]  They're trying to do their job, but they're being told they can't do it.
[00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.690]  They can only see what's going on in their area.
[00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.271]  It's the same in corporations, the same in medicine.
[00:37:09.132 --> 00:37:13.754]  They did the same thing with Big Pharma and the poison shots and lying about the origin and lying about all the heart attacks.
[00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:25.378]  And they paid the hospitals that would take the money, $53,000 for every person they intubated, another $10,000 if they died, or put them on remdesivir that turns your kidneys off and liver off.
[00:37:26.298 --> 00:37:27.579]  That's another microcosm of it.
[00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:30.740]  So, that's how they do it, is the Justice Department.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.141]  And the inspector generals go after good people and protect bad people.
[00:37:35.242 --> 00:37:38.383]  The CIA set up the National Security Act in 1947, got Congress to pass it.
[00:37:38.683 --> 00:37:42.045]  They were secret and were above the law, and out of that grew everything you see
[00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:52.861]  It goes back even to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, given the private bank's control, then the 47 Act, and then in the late 70s, setting up these Inspector Generals that are above the law.
[00:37:53.541 --> 00:37:55.443]  Now they want Inspector Generals to be over the Supreme Court.
[00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:57.205]  That's his fourth branch of government.
[00:37:58.706 --> 00:37:59.727]  That's how this is happening.
[00:37:59.827 --> 00:38:02.489]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:09.515]  And that's a good still image of him, but if you pull up the Peter Strzok
[00:38:11.218 --> 00:38:16.980]  It shows him making the different faces, and he literally is baring his teeth and looking like a gremlin or something.
[00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:19.722]  All right, so that's an excellent question.
[00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:22.843]  He just brought me more in, so we'll try to move quick now.
[00:38:25.084 --> 00:38:37.129]  Big Sal up north on X. Big Sal up north on X. Let's show people their handle.
[00:38:38.712 --> 00:38:44.336]  Do you ever regret staying the course and continuing to fight the dark, unseen Puppet Masters?
[00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:46.137]  You could have walked away.
[00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.520]  You have your own personal safety and your family to consider.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.482]  I have wondered if this weighs on you currently.
[00:38:55.444 --> 00:38:58.986]  Yeah, I mean, I've not really weighed on me, but I've certainly wargamed it a lot.
[00:39:00.627 --> 00:39:01.128]  Here's the deal.
[00:39:01.368 --> 00:39:02.269]  I can't give up.
[00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:03.209]  I can't give in.
[00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.570]  I can't sell out.
[00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:05.471]  It's not my nature.
[00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:12.145]  But I do get guilty sometimes that it's brought a tax on my parents and family, but they're all behind me.
[00:39:12.606 --> 00:39:15.047]  And they realize there's no future anyways if we don't beat this thing.
[00:39:15.908 --> 00:39:17.990]  So when you understand that kind of running from this...
[00:39:19.363 --> 00:39:22.464]  Particularly how far along we are, that it puts you in a worse position.
[00:39:23.405 --> 00:39:24.265]  For the general public.
[00:39:24.305 --> 00:39:33.729]  For me, physically or economically, yeah, you can say it's not safe and, you know, they've taken money away from me, but I had some money piled up as a backup to fight them, knowing it was coming.
[00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:35.770]  So, I mean, it was a pleasure.
[00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:36.650]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:39:37.591 --> 00:39:39.672]  I mean, I'm wearing a $15, $20 shirt.
[00:39:39.712 --> 00:39:40.712]  I'm wearing, you know, $80 shoes.
[00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:42.393]  I got a belt that I've had 25 years on.
[00:39:47.858 --> 00:39:48.759]  I mean, I wear a Rolex.
[00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:50.400]  My dad gave it to me like 18 years ago.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.660]  I never even wore a watch before that.
[00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:52.721]  I like it.
[00:39:53.241 --> 00:39:53.722]  I've worn it.
[00:39:53.802 --> 00:39:54.722]  It's not a status symbol.
[00:39:54.802 --> 00:40:02.747]  I, you know, got a 12-year-old truck and a 10-year-old car, and I love them.
[00:40:04.244 --> 00:40:08.505]  So, I mean, you know, I got gas for the car and food to eat, and it means nothing to me.
[00:40:08.525 --> 00:40:10.386]  What matters is standing up to these people.
[00:40:10.746 --> 00:40:15.528]  And so Zapata said it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[00:40:15.608 --> 00:40:19.949]  In my experience, people that live on their knees die much quicker and are slaves.
[00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:25.811]  People that fight on their feet live a lot better lives and only die once, it's been said.
[00:40:25.891 --> 00:40:28.192]  So, no.
[00:40:29.522 --> 00:40:35.728]  I mean, I can look back in hindsight and say, oh, I got manipulated on that, or I put out some false info there, I got set up, but that's part of the process of learning.
[00:40:36.048 --> 00:40:37.509]  We're not God, we're not close.
[00:40:39.131 --> 00:40:42.734]  So, all the bad things that have happened to me made me stronger.
[00:40:42.814 --> 00:40:44.256]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:40:44.296 --> 00:40:45.196]  Frederick Nietzsche, it's true.
[00:40:46.478 --> 00:40:55.066]  I have stared in the abyss too long, and it's had some problems there, so I stare at the Holy Spirit and God, and more and more, and then I don't let the enemy get me down.
[00:40:56.249 --> 00:40:57.950]  I don't fight the globalists because I hate them.
[00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.512]  I fight them because I'm defending the people and my children that live in a world with your children.
[00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:04.312]  So your children are as important as my children.
[00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:07.093]  And that's really where it is.
[00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:09.234]  I like being a Boy Scout.
[00:41:09.274 --> 00:41:10.115]  I like being a good guy.
[00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:10.875]  I like being strong.
[00:41:10.895 --> 00:41:11.795]  I've been strong my whole life.
[00:41:13.336 --> 00:41:15.397]  And that's what I do.
[00:41:16.757 --> 00:41:17.558]  Like my ancestors.
[00:41:19.478 --> 00:41:20.159]  And that's another thing.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.580]  There's a timelessness to this.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.301]  And I want people to look back on what I did.
[00:41:26.155 --> 00:41:27.236]  And it'd be an example to them.
[00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:30.538]  I live on through those before me.
[00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:32.340]  Those coming after me live on through me.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.721]  And so on forever.
[00:41:35.542 --> 00:41:39.185]  John Dow- Dawon?
[00:41:39.565 --> 00:41:40.386]  D-A-W-O-N?
[00:41:41.407 --> 00:41:41.727]  Dowon?
[00:41:41.747 --> 00:41:42.287]  John Dowon?
[00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:45.350]  And there's his handle right there.
[00:41:47.411 --> 00:41:53.096]  I want to know to what extent Biden, Kamala, and the rest of the left are complicit in the Chinese and Russian subversion
[00:41:54.465 --> 00:41:55.146]  We're good to go.
[00:42:09.438 --> 00:42:12.142]  That's a very good question and very complex.
[00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:15.045]  The Chi-Coms are a globalist project.
[00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:23.555]  The CIA put Mao Zedong into power in 1949, set up Chiang Kai-shek, gave him rifles without firing pins, killed the U.S.
[00:42:23.575 --> 00:42:26.179]  military people like John Birch that stayed behind to try to fight.
[00:42:28.786 --> 00:42:32.907]  China was then opened up after they exterminated 80 million of their people by the globalists in the 70s.
[00:42:33.507 --> 00:42:39.568]  One-sided deals were set up to make them the dominant manufacturer in the world, and a secret deal with the globalists that was since made public in the 90s.
[00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:46.029]  Then about 15 years ago, the Chinese began to double-cross the globalists, so a split began that became public about 10 years ago.
[00:42:47.289 --> 00:42:55.491]  And now communist China has a lot of agents and double agents in the West, but the West, the globalists have begun to, and the Anglo-American establishment, to cut them off.
[00:42:56.775 --> 00:43:17.867]  So the fissure has widened, and it's public knowledge that Saudi Arabia, China, and others are the biggest funders of governments, of the carbon taxes, and the anti-fracking, and the anti-gas, and the anti-coal, to cut off our energy, because we have more than anybody, and to make us buy our oil from them.
[00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:22.889]  Remember how Biden shut down all the drilling permits, and the Keystone Pipeline, and all the rest of that?
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.311]  And shut down ANWR, and all the rest of it?
[00:43:26.144 --> 00:43:32.026]  And then he said, we're going to buy it from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
[00:43:33.387 --> 00:43:35.328]  And then he drained most of our strategic reserves.
[00:43:35.408 --> 00:43:48.273]  So yeah, there are a lot of different special interests, but the globalist banks, the military industrial complex, the Israel lobbies heavily allied with China and double deals to screw America in that.
[00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:51.634]  Trump did try to actually stop that, cut it back a lot.
[00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:58.940]  And so, people like Walsh is a dyed-in-the-wool communist Chinese agent.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.501]  A lot of them just take money from him and they're like a vending machine.
[00:44:03.062 --> 00:44:07.063]  But he is a communist Chinese agent, so is Swallow as well, so is Feinstein, a bunch of other ones.
[00:44:08.244 --> 00:44:17.927]  And so it's not your idea, it's a fact that when we, quote, liberated Iraq 2003, the second time, China came in and got the oil.
[00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:20.568]  Trump's like, why are we doing that?
[00:44:20.588 --> 00:44:21.669]  We're gonna take the oil and give it to us.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.544]  America's the muscle setting up this world government, and while our power has decreased, we transfer our power to others.
[00:44:29.024 --> 00:44:32.707]  But then insiders, again, about 15 years ago, said actually China's double-crossing us.
[00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.869]  So the global started putting pressure on China.
[00:44:36.469 --> 00:44:37.350]  These are really good questions.
[00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.471]  I could go on for hours on that one.
[00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:52.361]  If Trump is not allowed to win, what do you see happening the first six months and the year after?
[00:44:54.952 --> 00:44:55.733]  Man, these are good.
[00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:02.798]  In fact, I'm going to take some of these questions this week and do like 30 minutes a piece on them because I kind of have to hurry through this so it's not as powerful.
[00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:10.564]  They are going to completely open the border, legalize all the illegals publicly.
[00:45:10.584 --> 00:45:11.384]  They already announced that.
[00:45:11.464 --> 00:45:13.806]  Feinstein or Schumer.
[00:45:14.887 --> 00:45:15.728]  Feinstein's dead.
[00:45:16.288 --> 00:45:19.150]  Pelosi, the other crip keeper, female crip keeper.
[00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.891]  Confuse them.
[00:45:21.266 --> 00:45:39.877]  They're going to just flood more fentanyl, stage false flags, massive censorship, arrest a bunch of broadcasters saying they work for Russia, accelerate war with Russia, just force more transgenderism on autistic kids.
[00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:42.739]  Everything you see tripled.
[00:45:46.341 --> 00:45:47.322]  Just hell on earth.
[00:45:49.503 --> 00:45:50.524]  Massive inflation.
[00:45:51.877 --> 00:46:01.848]  More giant, $300-plus billion fake environmental boondoggles giving money to themselves for ridiculous windmills and solar crap.
[00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:04.711]  I mean, that's just so hellish.
[00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:06.453]  That should be a question to listeners.
[00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:07.634]  I mean, there's so many angles to that.
[00:46:08.415 --> 00:46:09.376]  They're coming after your guns.
[00:46:09.396 --> 00:46:10.878]  They said they're going to ban all semi-auto.
[00:46:12.279 --> 00:46:13.100]  I mean, just hell on earth.
[00:46:18.777 --> 00:46:25.581]  Logan at real underscore Logan 23 says, do you think the deep state are going to kill Biden after his term is done?
[00:46:29.363 --> 00:46:34.506]  Probably because he's so embarrassing with so many criminal charges, then they can just blame him after he's dead for everything.
[00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:36.667]  He'll probably die on his own as well.
[00:46:37.388 --> 00:46:39.529]  But I don't think he and his son are long for the earth.
[00:46:39.569 --> 00:46:41.250]  I would definitely think they'll probably kill a hunter.
[00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:46.298]  They could kill him now and say a Trump supporter did it for sympathy for Kamala.
[00:46:46.478 --> 00:46:47.298]  They could kill Kamala.
[00:46:47.498 --> 00:46:50.199]  They're already rearranging him like deck chairs in the Titanic.
[00:46:51.379 --> 00:47:01.121]  John at Cimarron Road asks, if Biden pardons Hunter, then resigns and Harris steps into the presidency, how will the election be certified?
[00:47:02.662 --> 00:47:06.222]  Well, they don't follow the law anyway, so those do whatever they want.
[00:47:06.242 --> 00:47:08.183]  And if you question it, that's supposedly illegal now.
[00:47:09.127 --> 00:47:10.327]  I saw a CNN piece Friday.
[00:47:10.347 --> 00:47:10.968]  I had them record.
[00:47:11.008 --> 00:47:12.008]  I'm probably going to play it tomorrow.
[00:47:12.728 --> 00:47:17.710]  And it's like, there's an election official in Arizona who's going to retire after this because everybody's so mean to him.
[00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:18.430]  He has PTSD.
[00:47:18.531 --> 00:47:20.031]  And there was no fraud anywhere.
[00:47:20.051 --> 00:47:22.732]  And it's all made up and total evil and blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:22.772 --> 00:47:28.774]  I mean, in key Republican districts and key Republican precincts, all the ballots were two inches too short.
[00:47:28.834 --> 00:47:29.475]  It didn't work.
[00:47:29.575 --> 00:47:33.856]  I mean, they caught him doing that and indicted a guy a month ago in Houston, one of the top election people.
[00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:37.338]  I mean, and then you're like, oh, you're not supposed to question.
[00:47:37.378 --> 00:47:38.298]  They're election deniers.
[00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:53.336]  Steve Pagano says, I also want to ask, is what we know about the Earth and how it's structured false or fact?
[00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:59.961]  I'm a Christian, so I believe we are soul beings of this Earth and God made us as a test for us to follow God and be humble.
[00:48:00.421 --> 00:48:04.704]  I think these aliens are demons that control the elite.
[00:48:06.986 --> 00:48:08.927]  Yeah, I mean, I think the Earth's a sphere.
[00:48:08.947 --> 00:48:09.388]  I know it is.
[00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:10.308]  I've seen the other planets.
[00:48:10.348 --> 00:48:10.789]  I watch it.
[00:48:13.251 --> 00:48:18.916]  When the sun forms, it gets thrown off and liquid spinning molten hot and forms into a sphere.
[00:48:19.256 --> 00:48:21.618]  Just like if you do that with molten metal when you're welding.
[00:48:24.321 --> 00:48:27.424]  And you throw the arc up and some of the molten metal goes up in the air.
[00:48:27.444 --> 00:48:28.925]  By the time it hits the ground, it's little balls.
[00:48:30.266 --> 00:48:31.607]  But yeah, that's what the aliens are.
[00:48:31.627 --> 00:48:33.829]  That's demons and absolutely.
[00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.510]  I agree with.
[00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:38.792]  Nacho Taco.
[00:48:38.852 --> 00:48:43.935]  Let's say we wake up in two weeks and the internet doesn't work and the financial system is turned off.
[00:48:43.975 --> 00:48:44.596]  What do we do?
[00:48:44.936 --> 00:48:45.616]  How do we prepare?
[00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:47.377]  Now till then.
[00:48:47.478 --> 00:48:53.221]  Well, the first thing you do is ask that incredibly... I mean, I cannot believe how good these questions are.
[00:48:53.802 --> 00:48:56.504]  I mean, I'm not doing this service because every one of them I could do an hour on.
[00:48:56.544 --> 00:48:57.844]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:01.207]  And you know I'm not hyping that.
[00:49:01.267 --> 00:49:02.267]  Everybody's watching.
[00:49:02.287 --> 00:49:04.769]  It's going, damn, those are all really good questions.
[00:49:11.508 --> 00:49:12.849]  I have to table that question.
[00:49:12.869 --> 00:49:14.050]  I mean, because here's the deal.
[00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:22.217]  I don't want to sit there and try to do justice or something like that and give a half-assed answer.
[00:49:22.657 --> 00:49:28.582]  Because before I even read that this morning, these questions, I was already thinking about it the last few days.
[00:49:30.003 --> 00:49:33.726]  Because you see people's different perspectives when I read the comments on X. I love it.
[00:49:34.347 --> 00:49:36.489]  And the calls we get and the guests we have.
[00:49:37.981 --> 00:49:39.822]  And I get such mental feedback from that.
[00:49:40.383 --> 00:49:42.725]  Like, I don't ask questions on X, like, what do you think of this?
[00:49:42.945 --> 00:49:46.888]  Because that's an engagement thing to get people to sit there and then nobody's reading it.
[00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:50.251]  I mean, I'm from talk radio world, where I call, I want to hear your calls.
[00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:51.011]  It's great.
[00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:51.512]  I love it.
[00:49:52.672 --> 00:49:53.513]  And it gets me thinking.
[00:49:54.574 --> 00:49:55.295]  I'm addicted to it.
[00:49:56.055 --> 00:49:59.758]  My wife will, you know, catch me up at 2 a.m., like, with the computer reading comments, like, what are you doing?
[00:49:59.798 --> 00:50:00.979]  I'm just, I can't stop.
[00:50:00.999 --> 00:50:03.481]  And then the links you send, it's just, it's the best thing out there.
[00:50:04.302 --> 00:50:05.683]  And the comments on Infowars.com.
[00:50:07.154 --> 00:50:18.245]  So... There's no real way to attack this properly.
[00:50:18.285 --> 00:50:19.226]  It would take a full hour.
[00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:21.728]  It would take me hours to write up all my ideas on it.
[00:50:22.509 --> 00:50:25.992]  Because if I just give it a little peck at it, it doesn't do anything.
[00:50:27.731 --> 00:50:32.294]  It'd be like taking an egg you want to fry and just barely tapping on the edge of the pan.
[00:50:33.035 --> 00:50:37.438]  Or, you know, putting a steak on the grill at 150 degrees, it's not going to cook.
[00:50:37.518 --> 00:50:45.264]  It's just... That kind of question, all these questions make my brain go... Not lack of information, too much.
[00:50:48.126 --> 00:50:49.367]  I'm not going to half-ass that.
[00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:54.104]  A bunch of these.
[00:50:54.144 --> 00:51:01.289]  I just... I did half-ass some of these because... I mean, I gave you good answers, I think, but... Here's the microcosm, and I'll do it this way.
[00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:03.871]  Kirk Elliott was on.
[00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:09.875]  He talked about mainline analysts and showed them saying they think silver goes up 60% in the next four months.
[00:51:10.895 --> 00:51:11.976]  We're not sure that's going to happen.
[00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:13.397]  Let's say they're only half right.
[00:51:13.417 --> 00:51:13.737]  That's 30%.
[00:51:13.957 --> 00:51:17.359]  It's already up, like, the last year, like, 50% or something.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.260]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.261]  You look it up.
[00:51:20.256 --> 00:51:22.798]  And I see the commenters, I say, hey, where do you think silver's going?
[00:51:22.818 --> 00:51:23.959]  And I'm really reading it and thinking.
[00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:26.380]  And most of the commenters actually nailed what I was thinking.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.681]  That's what the knowledge of the crowd.
[00:51:28.122 --> 00:51:33.165]  They're like, we think silver by the end of the year is 50, and gold's 2,500.
[00:51:33.205 --> 00:51:36.027]  And I'm like, that's exactly what I wrote on the piece of paper.
[00:51:36.047 --> 00:51:42.492]  We're sitting in the kitchen last night, drinking ice water at 1 AM before I went to bed.
[00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:45.314]  I'm like, a whole bunch of the comments were exactly what I was thinking.
[00:51:46.835 --> 00:51:47.896]  That's what's uncanny about it.
[00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:55.755]  But then I saw some of the commenters going, you can't eat gold or silver during collapse, you need a food dehydrator.
[00:51:56.215 --> 00:51:57.336]  Well, of course you're right.
[00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:14.862]  A garden, food dehydration, some storable foods, a gun, guns, knowing how to use it, fishing poles, knowing how to use them, friends and family you can trust, property to bug out to if you don't already live in the country, if your family's spread out during an emergency, where you're going to rally point to, satellite phones.
[00:52:16.937 --> 00:52:18.098]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:52:18.138 --> 00:52:21.219]  Solar panels, charging blocks to hold the power.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.420]  That's just at that level.
[00:52:26.662 --> 00:52:28.483]  And people go, oh, you'll get arrested for gold and silver.
[00:52:28.543 --> 00:52:35.467]  No, that was in 33, when they ordered it turned in for paper, and then Nixon finally left it, because everybody had gold and silver.
[00:52:36.227 --> 00:52:37.528]  The money was gold and silver.
[00:52:38.468 --> 00:52:41.410]  A quarter was silver, until like the 80s, and they took more and more out.
[00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.090]  There's nothing now.
[00:52:44.071 --> 00:52:45.192]  Well, you can go, you know, old,
[00:52:46.323 --> 00:52:57.674]  You can go to banks and stuff and ask for a bunch of change, and people dig through it and find a quarter that's worth 50 bucks or whatever, not just because of the silver, but because of the date, or a penny that's worth, you know, 500 bucks, or 1,000, or 10,000, you know, because of the collectability.
[00:52:58.355 --> 00:53:09.766]  There's a lot of little, you know, diamonds out there, but... With only a couple, less than, a couple percentage of people own silver or gold,
[00:53:10.984 --> 00:53:12.985]  The system isn't coming after that when things go down.
[00:53:13.005 --> 00:53:15.026]  They're going to just force you into a central bank digital currency.
[00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:18.488]  And then there'll still be places to cash in the gold and silver, whatever the currency is.
[00:53:19.068 --> 00:53:20.709]  You obviously don't be able to know you got a bunch of it.
[00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:24.050]  I have basically none because I've been through bankruptcy.
[00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:32.994]  And in my last divorce, you know, the first, uh, with my first wife, you know, I, I traded gold and silver myself, bought it.
[00:53:33.034 --> 00:53:34.015]  Most of it at like 300 to $400 an ounce.
[00:53:34.035 --> 00:53:34.335]  It was up at 2000.
[00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:34.435]  And
[00:53:39.173 --> 00:53:45.075]  At the end of the divorce, it was worth over $2 million, but my ex-wife wouldn't agree to selling it.
[00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.816]  Right when the divorce started, the gold was starting to go down.
[00:53:48.156 --> 00:53:50.677]  It took a year to finish the divorce, and by then, it had lost half its value.
[00:53:51.757 --> 00:53:53.098]  And then, that got cashed out.
[00:53:54.338 --> 00:53:57.339]  So, I kind of got out of it at that point, because it was in a down market since then.
[00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:59.020]  The last few years, I've been wanting to get a sponsor.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.001]  I couldn't find one, because, you know, people are charging too much.
[00:54:03.021 --> 00:54:04.161]  Gold and silver is a great thing to get into.
[00:54:04.181 --> 00:54:08.523]  You just got to find somebody that's good, like Kirk Kelly at Precious Metals, kpm.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com
[00:54:09.209 --> 00:54:09.870]  Put that on screen.
[00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:11.811]  They sell it at wholesale.
[00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:13.212]  Then you know you're getting a good deal.
[00:54:13.732 --> 00:54:14.533]  Buy it back for nothing.
[00:54:14.593 --> 00:54:15.374]  That's insane.
[00:54:15.494 --> 00:54:16.294]  Almost no one does that.
[00:54:17.535 --> 00:54:22.419]  And hands down the best place, but people are like, oh, you can't eat that.
[00:54:22.439 --> 00:54:23.120]  No, no, no, no.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.700]  Oh, come on.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:24.801]  Skills.
[00:54:24.821 --> 00:54:25.802]  Knowing how to fix an engine.
[00:54:25.822 --> 00:54:26.882]  Knowing how to grow a farm.
[00:54:27.203 --> 00:54:28.183]  Knowing how to hunt.
[00:54:28.804 --> 00:54:29.524]  Knowing how to fight.
[00:54:29.665 --> 00:54:31.066]  I mean, there's so many valuable things.
[00:54:31.106 --> 00:54:36.730]  Having, you know, cars that run well that aren't modern, that don't have kill switches in them, like all the new cars were 15 years new.
[00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:37.791]  Now it's law they have them.
[00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:40.587]  I mean, there's a lot goes into this.
[00:54:40.627 --> 00:54:42.008]  Number one, a relationship with God.
[00:54:43.288 --> 00:54:44.448]  Have the people you can count on.
[00:54:44.468 --> 00:54:48.469]  I mean, you asked the question.
[00:54:48.489 --> 00:54:49.629]  I guess I'm kind of answering it.
[00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:56.691]  You better have all these shows and other shows and important things on hard drives downloaded.
[00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:58.631]  That knowledge will be more valuable in the future.
[00:54:58.871 --> 00:55:00.811]  These predictions will be more valuable if we don't stop them.
[00:55:01.432 --> 00:55:02.772]  Then we go into the full resistance mode.
[00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.113]  You got to be thinking about this.
[00:55:07.133 --> 00:55:08.113]  There's no perfect answer.
[00:55:10.202 --> 00:55:10.742]  Great question.
[00:55:10.762 --> 00:55:11.883]  I'll get back to more of that later.
[00:55:12.363 --> 00:55:12.663]  All right.
[00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:15.324]  Chase brought me a bunch of other questions.
[00:55:17.385 --> 00:55:18.026]  I mean, look at this one.
[00:55:18.046 --> 00:55:20.387]  I mean, this is the big enchilada right here.
[00:55:22.428 --> 00:55:24.269]  What are the chances Trump makes it to office?
[00:55:24.329 --> 00:55:27.330]  How can my family and I prepare if Kamala becomes president?
[00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:30.131]  I mean, just, that's kind of like the other question.
[00:55:32.733 --> 00:55:36.214]  That's by Lisa Staya.
[00:55:36.234 --> 00:55:39.336]  That's Lisa, S-T-A-I on X.
[00:55:41.113 --> 00:55:50.040]  What are your thoughts on the BRICS system?
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:50.540]  I mean, look at that.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.501]  That's a huge question.
[00:55:51.561 --> 00:55:52.282]  Truth exposed.
[00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:56.425]  Interested in the DOJ indictment of Tenet Media.
[00:55:56.445 --> 00:55:57.866]  I covered that Friday, but I'll do it more.
[00:55:58.186 --> 00:55:59.427]  Okay, I gotta stop there.
[00:56:01.509 --> 00:56:10.336]  Tomorrow night on the Sunday show, I will answer these other questions, 4 to 6 p.m., and I will take two of the other big ones that were too big to answer.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.101]  And I'll answer those.
[00:56:12.641 --> 00:56:13.542]  I got to think about these.
[00:56:13.602 --> 00:56:15.303]  I mean, these are brain twisters.
[00:56:17.305 --> 00:56:19.126]  Not because the answer isn't easy.
[00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:20.327]  There's so many answers.
[00:56:20.948 --> 00:56:22.529]  And you got to ask, what is the most important?
[00:56:22.569 --> 00:56:23.690]  That's the brain twister.
[00:56:25.011 --> 00:56:25.311]  So.
[00:56:26.712 --> 00:56:27.013]  I want to.
[00:56:28.634 --> 00:56:33.317]  That was exhausting for my little pea brain, because I'm trying to give you a good answer to try to do it quick.
[00:56:33.338 --> 00:56:35.459]  All right, let's set that aside.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.842]  Whoo, man.
[00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:42.621]  It's different than a headache.
[00:56:42.661 --> 00:56:44.382]  My brain is like burning right now.
[00:56:44.742 --> 00:56:45.782]  And I bet yours is too.
[00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:50.824]  See, the average leftist, be man or woman, mainly they're women, because women want to conform.
[00:56:50.864 --> 00:56:51.404]  It's genetic.
[00:56:51.424 --> 00:56:53.245]  They want to just have a good, they want to trust people.
[00:56:54.025 --> 00:56:57.486]  That's why old white women are the main Democrats and main communists around the world.
[00:56:57.986 --> 00:56:59.707]  And women in general, not putting women down.
[00:57:00.227 --> 00:57:01.188]  Women that are awake are the best.
[00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:05.249]  But they want to just hear a simple story that makes them feel good.
[00:57:05.269 --> 00:57:06.649]  And then they don't want to know all this stuff.
[00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:08.190]  They don't want to try to figure it all out.
[00:57:09.261 --> 00:57:11.062]  And the politicians will give you real simple answers.
[00:57:11.382 --> 00:57:12.283]  Everything's gonna be free!
[00:57:14.184 --> 00:57:16.645]  With a couple of strings attached, a couple of hooks in you.
[00:57:16.665 --> 00:57:19.287]  And of course, you never get what they said you would.
[00:57:21.148 --> 00:57:23.229]  But here, we're really trying to figure it all out.
[00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:26.951]  And I'm a very good generalist, and I know my audience is.
[00:57:27.032 --> 00:57:27.972]  It's just general knowledge.
[00:57:29.253 --> 00:57:32.855]  And I've been around 50 orbits of the sun, so I've had a lot of experience.
[00:57:32.875 --> 00:57:34.916]  But that's why I love taking your calls.
[00:57:34.956 --> 00:57:36.217]  You bring up points way better than mine.
[00:57:36.597 --> 00:57:37.838]  And these questions are just phenomenal.
[00:57:44.804 --> 00:57:54.609]  I talk a lot about the high-quality supplements at InfoWarsStore.com and the great things they'll do for your health, your vitality, your stamina, your libido, your focus, your clarity.
[00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:59.171]  And I tend to talk about our best-selling products from InfoWars MD.
[00:57:59.571 --> 00:58:05.013]  The Nitric Boost, the Tumor 95, the amazing CBD gummies, and 1000mg Tincture.
[00:58:05.134 --> 00:58:07.475]  It's about as strong as it gets, highest quality.
[00:58:07.675 --> 00:58:11.416]  But these other products are excellent as well, and they're getting rave reviews.
[00:58:11.456 --> 00:58:14.338]  Let's talk about some of these other great products from InfoWars MD.
[00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:17.519]  Superfood greens.
[00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:21.360]  Just a super high quality equivalent to some of the best sellers that are out there.
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.280]  It's got a whole bunch of superfoods in it.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:31.763]  You get everything you need in one big dose with all the key cofactors and things that a basic vitamin mineral type system may not have in it.
[00:58:32.123 --> 00:58:33.143]  It is a superfood.
[00:58:33.703 --> 00:58:35.604]  We also of course have good night's sleep.
[00:58:35.644 --> 00:58:42.606]  Just a good high quality natural herbal sleep system that gives you deep sleep that's so good for your immune system.
[00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:48.750]  But of course, Nerve Renew helps your nerves be healthy and helps a lot with pain.
[00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:50.731]  People really, really love Nerve Review.
[00:58:50.751 --> 00:59:00.617]  And we've got Probiotic Formula, an excellent probiotic that's so critical to your health because just the chlorine in tap water, if you're drinking that or showering in it, you know, kills the natural flora in your gut.
[00:59:00.978 --> 00:59:06.861]  Better Mood really, you know, gives you a clean, focused mindset, does amazing things.
[00:59:07.322 --> 00:59:09.223]  And then, of course, I'm really excited about
[00:59:09.403 --> 00:59:11.363]  Ashwagandha with black pepper.
[00:59:11.883 --> 00:59:13.444]  This is an adaptogen.
[00:59:13.624 --> 00:59:14.284]  Ashwagandha.
[00:59:14.564 --> 00:59:20.025]  Your brain, your heart, your mental clarity, your mood, your immune system.
[00:59:20.045 --> 00:59:21.045]  It just basically does everything.
[00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:22.665]  Ashwagandha is simply incredible.
[00:59:22.865 --> 00:59:27.726]  Then, of course, prostate support with a soft palmetto and more of its own record being so good for your prostate.
[00:59:28.046 --> 00:59:35.288]  These are just some of the products available at InfoWars MD line at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
