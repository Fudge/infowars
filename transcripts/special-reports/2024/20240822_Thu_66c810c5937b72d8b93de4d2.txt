[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.993]  Already exceeding the reference dose, the safe dose.
[00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:22.230]  Dr. Paul H. Conant is our guest and he is a environmental chemist and of course a toxicologist and has been a prominent critic in the U.S.
[00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.151]  and around the world.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:42.260]  Since he first researched exactly what the so-called substance fluoride is doing being added to our water but also being used as a pesticide and we had him in here just four or five months ago in studio with us and since then so many positive things have happened and I wanted to get him on to discuss
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.922]  The EPA has proposed a phase-out of fluoride-based pesticides.
[00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:47.962]  That's the New York Times.
[00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:50.003]  Other reports, U.S.
[00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:52.684]  wants to reduce fluoride in drinking water.
[00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:59.207]  The government's had to continue to admit that internal ingestion of fluoride does nothing for your teeth.
[00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:01.307]  It's only topical.
[00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:05.189]  And I've made the point many times, it's like drinking sunscreen.
[00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:10.632]  Instead of just putting it topically on and so there's major cracks in the facade.
[00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:17.237]  He's just returned to the United States from a trip to Australia, New Zealand and other nations.
[00:01:17.537 --> 00:01:23.080]  He just got back last night and he's here in Austin, Texas tomorrow to speak to the Austin City Council.
[00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:28.664]  So positive things are happening all over the world and he's here to give us a report on that.
[00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:29.905]  Dr. Conant, thanks for coming in.
[00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:30.985]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:36.947]  You know, water fluoridation is not the most important issue confronting our planet, but it's the easiest one to end.
[00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:40.628]  All you need is a strong wrist to turn off the tap.
[00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.389]  Once the tap is turned off, it's over.
[00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:51.992]  But you need the political will to turn the tap off, and to get that political will, we need people informed, and we need people organised.
[00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:58.674]  Thanks to you, millions of people around the world are being informed on this issue, and thanks to Fluoride Free Texas,
[00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:06.096]  Thousands of people in the city of Austin are being informed about the issue and organized, being organized on the issue.
[00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:11.217]  So we're keeping our fingers crossed that Austin, Texas will be our next big victory.
[00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:19.659]  A few days ago it was finalized that Calgary in Alberta, that's 1.1 million people, are now going to be fluoride free.
[00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:21.940]  And after 20 years.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.161]  And people in Waterloo, Ontario voted it out.
[00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.603]  So the squeeze is on Ontario.
[00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:33.566]  And don't forget that most of British Columbia and most of Quebec, the wings of Canada, are already fluoridation free.
[00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:38.028]  And we're squeezing on Alberta with Calgary out, Edmonton maybe next.
[00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:40.829]  And then we're squeezing on Ontario.
[00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.613]  If Ontario was to go, if Toronto was to go, or even Ottawa was to go, I think it would be the end of fluoridation in Canada.
[00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:51.416]  Meanwhile, we've got a very good organizing group in New Zealand.
[00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:56.879]  FAN New Zealand is excellent, and FAN Australia has just been formed.
[00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.660]  So there's a fight back everywhere.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.542]  And then a few days ago I was in Dublin, which is mandatory fluoridation.
[00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.252]  Because of American pressure back in the 1960s, Ireland has mandatory fluoridation.
[00:03:09.412 --> 00:03:11.073]  It's the odd man out in Europe.
[00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:13.855]  Only three countries in Europe have any fluoridation at all.
[00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:18.098]  England at 10%, Spain at 3%, and Ireland at 73%.
[00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:24.062]  But lots of people in Ireland don't want this fluoride in their water, but many other people
[00:03:24.602 --> 00:03:24.962]  I don't know.
[00:03:43.567 --> 00:04:02.223]  I briefly want to give people a recap of just some of the basics of the danger of fluoridation and how discredited it's gotten and what it signifies for you that this facade of you people are crazy is beginning to fall in because I've seen the reports of the majority of government scientists and unions
[00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:12.947]  Sending in their own letters, toxicologists, environmental chemists, saying this is insane, the increases in bone cancer, the fracturing of the bones, the dental furosis.
[00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.308]  I mean, it's such a hoax.
[00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:23.411]  But before we go there, you also gave me some very positive news earlier when we were talking about what's happening in the state of Georgia.
[00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.332]  Yes, some very prominent black leaders.
[00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:41.016]  Andrew Young, former ambassador to the UN, former mayor of Atlanta, whose father was a dentist and for years was pro-fluoridation, came out with a public statement a few days ago calling for an end to mandatory fluoridation in Georgia.
[00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:49.180]  And the reason is that they're now finding that black children are much more sensitive, appear to be much more sensitive to fluoride for a number of factors.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.844]  For example, the rates of dental fluorosis, which is caused by fluoride, mottling of the teeth, is greater for black children and Hispanic children than it is for white children.
[00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:00.645]  But the parents are not being warned.
[00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:09.069]  You know, in terms of the basics, probably the single most basic fact that anybody needs to know is the level of fluoride in mother's milk.
[00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:23.605]  You know, what was developed over millions of years by evolution, mother nature, however you saw the development of humankind, this is baby's first meal, which is designed to be the best delivery of all the things that the body needs, right?
[00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:25.707]  And it's practically none!
[00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:28.691]  The level of fluoride in mother's milk is 0.004 parts per million.
[00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:40.600]  Which means a bottle fed baby is getting, in a fluoridated town like Austin, is getting 250 times more fluoride than nature intended.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.547]  And then you have these lunatics, these people that are more interested in money than protecting our babies or our health, selling
[00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:58.764]  For babies, for baby, look, for baby, water, so-called purified water, which has fluoride added to it.
[00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:04.551]  So they're deliberately giving babies 250 times more fluoride than nature intended.
[00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:07.414]  And they push it in the public schools, they've got dozens of brands.
[00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:10.455]  They've got it in packages, little school buses on the side.
[00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.776]  You go to grocery stores or baby stores, there's giant end caps.
[00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.957]  They've got recordings playing, your baby needs it, they've got to have it.
[00:06:17.237 --> 00:06:20.138]  But you just broke down the facts and I've read the statistics.
[00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:20.798]  Go over some of them.
[00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.519]  Am I correct, doctor, that the studies show
[00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.762]  These different fluoride types have a much more adverse effect on babies and the developing?
[00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:36.286]  Yes, it's the first year which is the most sensitive year according to government-funded researchers from Iowa.
[00:06:36.586 --> 00:06:41.489]  It's the first year in which the baby's at greatest risk at developing dental fluorosis.
[00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:43.690]  And we've got a huge problem now in the United States, 41%.
[00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:45.611]  And that's up from...
[00:06:57.052 --> 00:07:01.453]  10%.
[00:06:57.072 --> 00:07:01.453]  10% was where they began in 1945.
[00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:02.614]  That's what they thought.
[00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:10.796]  We can fluoridate the water at one part per million, lower tooth decay, and we'll keep the dental fluorosis at 10% in its very mild form.
[00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:19.559]  Now we have 41%, probably 50% in fluoridated communities, and 3.6% of those have moderate or severe dental fluorosis.
[00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:24.080]  And from the studies I've read, but correct me if I'm wrong, this is the surface
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.462]  We're good to go.
[00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:48.282]  Only find that was caused or not by fluoride if you do the studies.
[00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:51.185]  And we're just not doing the studies in this country.
[00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:59.613]  We're not doing any studies to see if there's a relationship between fluoridation and arthritis, even though we know the first symptoms of fluoride poisoning of the bone is just like arthritis.
[00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:07.260]  We're not looking to see if there's a relationship between fluoridation and the massive increase of hypo-underactive thyroid gland.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.325]  Even though doctors used to give fluoride tablets to lower thyroid function in the 30s, 40s and 50s.
[00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:14.686]  Very low doses, by the way.
[00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:29.098]  We're not looking to see if there's a relationship with fluoridation and lowered IQ, even though we have 24 studies now from China, India, Iran and Mexico, which shows that moderate exposure to fluoride is lowering IQ in children.
[00:08:29.138 --> 00:08:30.079]  Well, that was my next point.
[00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.062]  You're saying we're not studying it because this is the home of fluoride where it began.
[00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:46.010]  You live here in the United States as well, but all these other countries have, and we know that the teeth turning into pot-eaten, you know, yellow wrecks, that's only the surface effect, the brain.
[00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.350]  That's right.
[00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:48.112]  What about glands in the brain?
[00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:58.618]  Yeah, the pineal gland, this little gland between the two hemispheres of the brain, it concentrates fluoride because it's a calcifying tissue just like the teeth and the bones.
[00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:09.785]  And the researcher that did this, somebody I've met several times, Dr. Jennifer Luke in England, she also showed that animals lowered melatonin production and this pineal gland
[00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:10.605]  Thank you.
[00:09:27.652 --> 00:09:33.114]  No country, no fluoridating country has attempted to reproduce her work, and it's not.
[00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:51.238]  But strangely enough, in the studies I've seen, levels of fluoride are known to accelerate puberty and basically aging, and then we wonder why, amongst the other hormones and things that are in the meat, that our girls are going into puberty at now not just six or seven or eight, but three years old in many cases.
[00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:56.041]  You see the areas of the world where fluoridation is going on.
[00:09:56.081 --> 00:10:02.965]  We have these hot spots of the boys being effeminate and the women going into puberty earlier.
[00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:07.328]  But the point is, from a scientific perspective, if you don't look, you don't find.
[00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:11.351]  And the absence of study does not mean the absence of harm.
[00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:21.457]  And unfortunately, what is being done in the United States, particularly by the Center of Disease Control, is to essentially say, oh, we're not finding any effects at one part per million.
[00:10:21.597 --> 00:10:22.498]  Well, you're not looking!
[00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.781]  I know you're a fan of Monty Python, as I am.
[00:10:26.442 --> 00:10:32.228]  And we had Dr. Peter Cooney, who's the Chief Dental Officer for Canada.
[00:10:32.268 --> 00:10:36.793]  He went into Dryden, Ontario, shortly before they voted Fruidation out.
[00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:37.794]  That's another victory.
[00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:43.881]  He says, I've walked down your high street today and I didn't see anybody growing horns.
[00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:47.822]  Horns, and you've been fluoridated for 40 years.
[00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.262]  So that's the level of research in Canada.
[00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.622]  You know, come in, John Cleese.
[00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.043]  Well, John, what are we going to do to study this fluoridation thing?
[00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.703]  How can we demonstrate to the public... He doesn't have any horns!
[00:10:57.903 --> 00:10:58.763]  He's fine!
[00:10:58.803 --> 00:11:00.384]  We'll have a whole department!
[00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:07.045]  We'll have a specialist in deer horns, moose horns, goat horns, bull horns, cow horns... Rabbit horns!
[00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.965]  We'll cover the country!
[00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:14.146]  If we see horns growing, we'll cut that fluoride off!
[00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:15.447]  That's it, that's it John.
[00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:16.468]  Jolly good, you got it.
[00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:19.332]  What about forking tails as well?
[00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:21.414]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:27.680]  And by the way John, what do you think about getting rid of this hazardous waste from the phosphate fertilizer industry?
[00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:34.768]  Well we'll just put it in the water and if they complain we'll say if Easter bunnies spontaneously appear then we'll take it out.
[00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:53.790]  I mean, can you think of anything more bizarre that the hazardous waste of the superphosphate fertiliser industry, they can't dump it into the sea by international law, they can't dump it locally because it's too concentrated, but if someone buys it from them, it becomes a product.
[00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:58.815]  And once it's a product, then they can put it in the drinking water and tell us it's good for our teeth.
[00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:10.424]  Well, expanding on that, I mean, you say they haven't studied it here, but there have been studies all over the world, and there have been studies of what higher levels of fluoride do, and we know it's deadly poison and attacks the body at every level.
[00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:13.367]  I mean, you've spoken about how it's really an adjuvant.
[00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:19.672]  It also accelerates all the other toxins, and if it's something that bioaccumulates, then we do know it's bad.
[00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:20.552]  It's crazy.
[00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:29.098]  Well, first of all, going back to real basic common sense stuff, the whole notion of using the public drinking water to deliver medicine is crazy.
[00:12:29.538 --> 00:12:33.081]  Because once you put a medicine in the water, you can't control the dose.
[00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:44.388]  You can control the concentration at the waterworks, but you can't control how much water people drink, and you can't control how much fluoride they're getting from other sources, so you can't control the dose.
[00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:45.869]  Ask any pharmacist.
[00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:47.170]  This is sheer lunacy.
[00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.751]  But that's my next point.
[00:12:50.272 --> 00:13:05.459]  You were, earlier when we were talking on the radio, breaking down how they gas the food with fluoride, and they also have systems where they spray it on, and many of the doctors I've talked to over the years said, look, water's bad, but this is where they're really putting the toxic waste.
[00:13:05.479 --> 00:13:07.880]  Well now, going back to January 10th,
[00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:20.146]  Absolutely, of this year, four or five months ago, EPA proposes phase-out of fluoride-based pesticide because we're dealing with hundreds of times what they're putting in the water.
[00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:25.389]  But the fact that they're now starting to back off on this, why do you think that's happening?
[00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:31.911]  Well, it was an amazing victory for the Fluoride Action Network with help from the Environmental Working Group and Beyond Pesticides.
[00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:47.756]  This has been an eight-year effort on our part to demonstrate that they cannot introduce this sulfuryl fluoride for the treatment of food in warehouses and processing plants because our kids are already exceeding the reference dose, the safe dose.
[00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:48.417]  We know that.
[00:13:48.437 --> 00:13:51.478]  They're already overexposed to fluoride.
[00:13:53.298 --> 00:14:04.322]  The way the pesticide division works, they establish a reference dose, and the combination of the pesticides plus the background must not exceed the reference dose.
[00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:10.084]  But if you're exceeding the reference dose before you've added a speck of the pesticide, then clearly you can't do it.
[00:14:10.344 --> 00:14:12.565]  They try to change... Again, fluoride as a pesticide?
[00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:13.045]  Yeah.
[00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:14.365]  Because it's so good for our children.
[00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:18.007]  This is hiding in plain view!
[00:14:19.873 --> 00:14:22.494]  We need to give the children the pesticide!
[00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:24.735]  What type of conspiracy theorists are you?
[00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:27.055]  I don't see no whores going there, Governor.
[00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:28.496]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:29.236]  It's incredible.
[00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:33.617]  But they changed the reference dose three times to try to accommodate Dow AgroSciences.
[00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:39.459]  And when we threatened to take them to court, we had a wonderful lawyer, pro bono lawyer in Washington, Perry.
[00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:50.767]  I've had you on and you never bragged that it was your group that did this.
[00:14:50.867 --> 00:14:58.513]  She was the one that came to you and showed it to you and you said, that's crazy.
[00:14:58.753 --> 00:14:59.634]  Then you read the documents.
[00:14:59.754 --> 00:15:00.134]  That's right.
[00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:03.637]  15 years ago, she put these papers on my desk and said, Paul, will you read these?
[00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:04.838]  I said, what is it?
[00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:05.818]  She said, fluoridation.
[00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:06.779]  I said, take that away.
[00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:07.760]  These people are crazy.
[00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:11.122]  I was very embarrassed when she finally forced me to read it.
[00:15:11.623 --> 00:15:16.689]  It's not these people that are crazy, but some of the people in the government who are crazy.
[00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.131]  You know what?
[00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:21.995]  I've tried to work out for 15 years.
[00:15:22.015 --> 00:15:26.080]  You'll notice in our book, it's the last chapter, trying to understand motivations.
[00:15:26.701 --> 00:15:30.122]  Now, for the rank-and-file dentists and doctors, it's very simple.
[00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.882]  They're too busy treating patients to read the literature.
[00:15:33.002 --> 00:15:33.603]  Most of them don't.
[00:15:33.723 --> 00:15:36.383]  You've got a wonderful guy in Austin, Griffin Cole.
[00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:37.403]  He's a dentist.
[00:15:37.483 --> 00:15:40.244]  He has read the literature, and he's very much opposed to it.
[00:15:40.784 --> 00:15:42.464]  A very important man, Griffin Cole.
[00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.965]  But most dentists and doctors don't have time to read the literature.
[00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:46.945]  We do, of course.
[00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:48.326]  Three professors here.
[00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:50.606]  Retired professors at that.
[00:15:51.306 --> 00:15:53.607]  Then you've got the people in the middle of the bureaucracy.
[00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:57.269]  Basically, they are trained not to question policy.
[00:15:57.349 --> 00:15:59.810]  Policy is determined in Washington.
[00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:00.910]  It's like the military.
[00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.731]  They follow orders.
[00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:02.891]  They follow orders, literally.
[00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:05.793]  And the CDC, remember, is in uniform.
[00:16:05.953 --> 00:16:12.336]  It's a uniform branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC.
[00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:13.236]  They're in uniform.
[00:16:13.316 --> 00:16:14.016]  Surgeon General.
[00:16:14.157 --> 00:16:14.957]  Surgeon General.
[00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:18.258]  Yes, you say, it's a chain of command.
[00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:20.339]  So don't expect the middle bureaucrats.
[00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.181]  Don't expect the health officers in the cities
[00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:31.026]  And then the big chemical companies, they lobby the politicians that give the orders to the bureaucrats who give the orders to the unquestioning minions that then put it in our water.
[00:16:31.287 --> 00:16:32.768]  And meanwhile, it's a pesticide.
[00:16:33.128 --> 00:16:38.092]  I mean, they had a guy in California a few months ago who went into a house that was being gassed to kill bedbugs.
[00:16:38.492 --> 00:16:40.994]  He walked in, a homeless guy, for like a minute and it killed him.
[00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:43.436]  And it killed him, and it said... That's the same stuff.
[00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:44.516]  That's sulfuric fluoride.
[00:16:44.657 --> 00:16:44.897]  Yeah.
[00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:45.377]  Been used.
[00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:45.917]  Vicane.
[00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:48.159]  Been used for years to fumigate buildings.
[00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:48.740]  So this is simple.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.301]  He walked in and seconds was dead.
[00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:51.382]  That's right.
[00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:53.303]  And this is what they're pumping the food with.
[00:16:53.843 --> 00:16:56.665]  And you were talking about the numbers of what gets in white flour and things.
[00:16:56.726 --> 00:17:02.390]  Yeah, the level in the flour that was being permitted by the EPA was 125 parts per million.
[00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.775]  And that flour, wheat flour, goes into dough, pizza dough, bread, cookies, cakes, and so on.
[00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.496]  And there's no doubt that's to kill bugs.
[00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.658]  So you're eating something that's meant to kill bugs.
[00:17:13.698 --> 00:17:18.002]  Now, I'm no rocket scientist, but I mean, that's insane.
[00:17:18.262 --> 00:17:23.846]  But the top of the chain of command, I went to the bottom, in the middle, what about the top?
[00:17:23.946 --> 00:17:30.391]  What's the motivation of these people in the Center of Disease Control, etc., Department of Health, Kathleen Sebelius?
[00:17:30.472 --> 00:17:32.533]  Why do they keep this going?
[00:17:33.054 --> 00:17:33.554]  For me, it's
[00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:37.436]  The fear of losing credibility.
[00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:42.037]  They have waxed lyrical so much, for so long, about this practice.
[00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:46.119]  I think they fear that if they lose fluoridation, they lose credibility.
[00:17:46.439 --> 00:17:54.342]  If they lose credibility, they lose other, the public's trust, which threatens other public health policies.
[00:17:54.362 --> 00:17:57.703]  This is the same government that secretly injected black people with syphilis.
[00:17:57.983 --> 00:17:58.083]  Yeah.
[00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:00.804]  And now it's come out they were doing it in Latin America and the atomic soldiers.
[00:18:00.824 --> 00:18:02.604]  I mean, these people have no credibility.
[00:18:02.785 --> 00:18:17.329]  And I agree with you, Doctor, at that level, at the top policy wonks, but they're taking orders from people like John P. Holdren and people he admired before him who all wrote about putting things like this in the water to reduce fertility.
[00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.050]  And we know it reduces fertility.
[00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:27.053]  And we know that they see us as animals, as a scourge upon the earth, and that's what my film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers, is their own statements.
[00:18:27.353 --> 00:18:28.414]  This is being done by design.
[00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:32.135]  I know you only stick with what, you know, the actual chemicals.
[00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:38.257]  I would make a distinction between the dentists and doctors out there who are usually very decent people.
[00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:39.177]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:18:39.277 --> 00:18:40.597]  Yeah, they do not.
[00:18:40.897 --> 00:18:49.180]  I don't think they have any notion other than what they've been told, that fluoridation is good for teeth and that it's perfectly safe.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.301]  But I mean, I know you don't like to talk about it, but off record here on camera, I mean, the whole eugenics angle.
[00:18:55.662 --> 00:19:02.263]  Have you seen those quotes and statements where they, even in the 40s, talked about how they needed chemicals, and they decided on fluoride?
[00:19:02.423 --> 00:19:02.603]  Yeah.
[00:19:02.903 --> 00:19:04.424]  No, I haven't seen that.
[00:19:04.564 --> 00:19:05.284]  I haven't seen that.
[00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:10.265]  But I try to put that to one side, because we have them on the ropes with the science.
[00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:16.447]  You know, the best study they've ever done on tooth decay in the United States, they looked at 39,000 children.
[00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:18.528]  I don't know.
[00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:42.285]  0.6 of one tooth surface out of over a hundred tooth surfaces in a child's mouth.
[00:19:42.506 --> 00:19:45.348]  And you have to say to yourself, is this world crazy?
[00:19:45.368 --> 00:19:49.051]  Are we doing all this to save 0.6 of a tooth surface?
[00:19:49.211 --> 00:20:00.320]  Are we going to threaten their brains, lower IQ, bone damage in adults, arthritis, lower thyroid function, all these possibilities to save 0.6 of one tooth surface.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.462]  It doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:20:03.163 --> 00:20:10.176]  Well, no, at the end of the day, they've got a toxic waste they can't get rid of and taxpayers end up paying to have it put in their water.
[00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:14.564]  In closing, because in a few minutes you've got to leave here because you've got to go to the Austin City Council.
[00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:26.123]  That same day, back on January 10, 2011, when they said we're going to phase out fluoride as a pesticide, because it's so nutritious for your children, U.S.
[00:20:26.143 --> 00:20:30.447]  wants to reduce fluoride in drinking water from 1.1 part per million to 0.7.
[00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:32.169]  What does that signify?
[00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:42.301]  It signifies that they're having to come back with some kind of way to absorb all this mounting opposition to fluoridation around the country.
[00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:44.583]  It's like... 0.7 is still too high.
[00:20:44.603 --> 00:20:46.365]  I mean, it's 175 times the level in Mothers Mill.
[00:20:48.948 --> 00:20:50.609]  So we really haven't made an advance.
[00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.490]  But it looks as if they're doing something.
[00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.931]  It looks as if they care.
[00:20:54.311 --> 00:21:08.018]  But on the same day, the Office of Water of the EPA said, we are going to determine a new safe drinking water standard which will protect our children's health and protect the water fluoridation programme.
[00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:09.478]  And we're saying you can't do both.
[00:21:09.858 --> 00:21:16.962]  You can't keep water fluoridation going if the object is to come up with a safe drinking water standard which protects everyone.
[00:21:17.022 --> 00:21:35.402]  Well how can they everywhere put out water for babies and tell mothers give this fluoridated water to your baby when going back six years the American Dental Association said don't give fluoride toothpaste to kids under six, when what they came out in 99 and admitted it doesn't do anything good when ingested, it's only topical.
[00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:36.424]  I mean they know this.
[00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:37.325]  I guess it's some gimmick.
[00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:44.348]  Well, the trouble is the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, has never approved fluoride for ingestion.
[00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:45.569]  They've washed their hands of this.
[00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:47.550]  It's an unapproved drug.
[00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:54.873]  And so these companies, I guess, can get away with this because the FDA is not watching, is not doing its job.
[00:21:55.153 --> 00:21:56.614]  This wouldn't pass the FDA.
[00:21:56.874 --> 00:21:59.798]  Hey, I've got an idea for all these companies to put it out, because I know you're watching.
[00:22:00.058 --> 00:22:07.827]  How about you come out with purified water with no additives for your baby, or purified water with added minerals, no fluoride.
[00:22:08.087 --> 00:22:11.652]  I'll guarantee you, just like 10 years ago, all the milk had the
[00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:12.272]  Yeah.
[00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:30.452]  And the reason I'm giving you that great idea is because I don't like brain damaging children.
[00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:33.895]  You care about money, I care about kids not being brain damaged, okay?
[00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:40.059]  So, still, you're selfish and evil, you know what you're doing, why don't you go ahead and advertise it's fluoride free?
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.761]  You'd make a lot more money than going along with this evil...
[00:22:44.643 --> 00:22:50.185]  In fact, the company here in Austin, Texas is putting out a product called Pure Rainwater.
[00:22:50.226 --> 00:22:54.628]  This is rainwater from Oregon which then goes through extra treatment.
[00:22:54.688 --> 00:22:58.230]  So yes, there is a demand for pure water, for clean water.
[00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:07.574]  The only thing I would urge people to do if they get water which has got everything taken out of it, make sure you buttress it with the nutrients that you need.
[00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:09.315]  You need the minerals.
[00:23:09.415 --> 00:23:12.237]  You need the minerals, you need the calcium, you need the magnesium and so on.
[00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:14.099]  Now that's the problem with reverse osmosis.
[00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:16.622]  Well, Dr. Conant, I just want to say, great job.
[00:23:17.524 --> 00:23:24.533]  In closing, they're not studying it here, but we do have studies all over the world, prestigious studies on the IQ issue.
[00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:28.378]  Close with that, because this is incontrovertible facts.
[00:23:28.598 --> 00:23:30.400]  We have just got two studies out.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:36.665]  One was an update of a study done in 2003 by Zhang and co-workers from China.
[00:23:36.705 --> 00:23:39.968]  And I visited the villages where this study was done, by the way.
[00:23:40.508 --> 00:23:49.336]  And he showed that there's a relationship between the amount of fluoride in the plasma of the children and the lowered IQ.
[00:23:49.696 --> 00:23:52.419]  So as the level of fluoride in the plasma goes up,
[00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:53.619]  We're good to go.
[00:24:14.964 --> 00:24:22.393]  In that range of 0.3 to 3 parts per million, well this overlaps the range that we use in the United States, 0.7 to 1.2.
[00:24:22.713 --> 00:24:27.178]  So this completely knocks out the notion... And there's a lot of other studies, those are just the new ones.
[00:24:27.218 --> 00:24:29.601]  We also have studies of animals.
[00:24:30.582 --> 00:24:32.684]  Oh, over a hundred animal studies.
[00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:35.206]  There's no question.
[00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:50.300]  Oh, the EPA itself, the Department of Neurotoxicology, I've forgotten the full title, has said that there is substantial evidence that fluoride is a neurotoxicant.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.103]  Substantial evidence that fluoride is a neurotoxicant.
[00:24:55.504 --> 00:25:07.332]  And here we've got this stupid company putting a thing into the water for which the EPA says there is substantial evidence that fluoride is a neurotoxin.
[00:25:07.493 --> 00:25:08.894]  Damages the brain.
[00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:10.074]  Amazing.
[00:25:10.094 --> 00:25:10.734]  We'll leave it at that.
[00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:13.055]  Dr. Conant, give us the website.
[00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:15.555]  fluoridealert.org.
[00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:18.076]  Make sure you spell fluoride, F-L-U.
[00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:23.057]  Think of flu-fluoride, not fluoride, fluoridealert.org.
[00:25:23.577 --> 00:25:32.559]  When you go there, you can see how to get hold of this book, The Case Against Fluoride, and also you'll find a videotape there called Professional Perspectives on Water Fluoridation.
[00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:45.271]  It's only 28 minutes long, 15 scientists, three from the guys who wrote the National Research Council report, two former EPA scientists, a Nobel Prize winner, several other scientists.
[00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:54.299]  In 28 minutes, if that doesn't convince you that you've got to stop fluoridation in Austin, Texas and everywhere else in the world that this program goes, I don't know what would do it.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.020]  Well said.
[00:25:56.821 --> 00:26:00.442]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come, as Victor Hugo said.
[00:26:00.983 --> 00:26:01.923]  And just great job.
[00:26:01.963 --> 00:26:05.064]  We are definitely on the march and the empire is on the run.
[00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:08.386]  Dr. Connick, God bless you and thank you for joining us today.
[00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:11.487]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:13.408]  Please spread this video to the four winds.
[00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:14.949]  We've got a lot of people to warn.
[00:26:15.129 --> 00:26:15.809]  Thank you for watching.
[00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:24.637]  Ask yourselves, what are you doing in this time of great challenge?
[00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:27.120]  What are you doing to unlock mine?
[00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:33.460]  Go to infowars.com and personplanet.tv for the latest headlines.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.401]  I am Chase Geyser, your host for a short period of time.
[00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:42.962]  We are going to be joined very shortly by a very special guest who I think you will very much enjoy.
[00:26:43.542 --> 00:26:53.684]  And Rex Jones will be joining me at the top of the hour in about 30 minutes, followed by Alex Jones, who will be in studio sometime between 8 and 8.30 or so as things ramp up at the DNCCP.
[00:26:53.704 --> 00:26:55.264]  Now, we know there are going to be a bunch of speakers tonight.
[00:26:55.564 --> 00:26:58.145]  The only one who really seems to matter is Kamala Harris.
[00:26:59.127 --> 00:27:05.589]  Which is why we're so excited to have this special guest with us, who I will announce as soon as the crew lets me know is properly connected.
[00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:10.110]  Obviously, she couldn't be here in person because this is a very big night for her.
[00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.031]  So, absolutely amazing stuff happening out there.
[00:27:13.071 --> 00:27:22.494]  We've had three days of hell, basically, with the DNCCP and its coverage, and the riots outside, and the speakers, and the lies, and the psychological manipulation, if you will.
[00:27:22.514 --> 00:27:25.935]  And we're finally coming up on the end of this series
[00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:29.957]  All on the cusp of the news that RFK Jr.
[00:27:30.097 --> 00:27:36.881]  is set to announce his dropping out of the race and his endorsement for Donald Trump tomorrow via video.
[00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.682]  Now it's possible this doesn't happen.
[00:27:38.722 --> 00:27:41.304]  It's possible this was a head fake and RFK Jr.
[00:27:41.324 --> 00:27:47.547]  is simply doing this to leverage a position in Kamala Harris's administration that would be particularly scheming of him to do.
[00:27:47.887 --> 00:27:52.010]  But based on the high-level sources that we have here at InfoWars, we believe this report
[00:27:52.892 --> 00:27:55.802]  95% certain to be true that this endorsement is really going to happen.
[00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:58.169]  There are a couple of things that really.
[00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:05.857]  Kind of emphasize it's likely that this endorsement is genuine.
[00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:18.506]  The first thing, of course, is he did a video today about how close we were to civil war on July 13th when there was an assassination attempt of Donald Trump.
[00:28:19.386 --> 00:28:25.150]  And one thing I've noticed watching this DNC, maybe you listeners have noticed this as well, is
[00:28:26.917 --> 00:28:30.899]  They are absolutely refusing to acknowledge that there was an attempt on Donald Trump's life.
[00:28:31.739 --> 00:28:47.247]  And I was appalled to see on the first night they accused January 6th protesters of attempting to take Mike Pence's life on January 6th, 2021, without acknowledging that they, the leftists in the deep state, or that anyone for that matter, had attempted to take the life of Donald Trump.
[00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:54.011]  Now there was a breaking news report today at the end of the War Room on InfoWars.com forward slash show where we broadcast every day in every way.
[00:28:55.157 --> 00:29:06.421]  That Donald Trump abruptly ended an interview with News Nation saying that, quote, they don't want me here, they don't want you here, it's not safe, things of that nature, and then quickly kind of being whisked away.
[00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:10.082]  So it seems like there might have been a legitimate threat on Donald Trump's life this afternoon.
[00:29:10.102 --> 00:29:15.764]  You can see the report on that at RealAlexJones on X. We've uploaded the clips of the interview, the moment that he walked away.
[00:29:16.044 --> 00:29:21.166]  You can see the very beginning of the clip, the moment that he got the verbal signal from his security that something was amiss and he needed to go.
[00:29:22.826 --> 00:29:31.432]  And you can see Alex Jones's prediction from this morning that there was going to be another attempt on Donald Trump's life, and they were going to use it to blame Iran to catalyze World War Three.
[00:29:31.472 --> 00:29:46.442]  Now, ever since July 13th of 2024, that fateful day that there was an attempt on Donald Trump's life, we have seen report after report, claim after claim, prediction after prediction from Alex Jones that it would not be the last time that there would be an attempt on Donald Trump's life.
[00:29:46.502 --> 00:29:52.466]  It seems like today may have been an instance proving that prediction true, but we're waiting on developing details regarding
[00:29:52.506 --> 00:29:53.627]  We're good to go.
[00:30:12.598 --> 00:30:13.099]  Let's do it!
[00:30:30.336 --> 00:30:32.516]  This clip and show you what happened with Donald Trump.
[00:30:32.536 --> 00:30:37.977]  This is clip number two, where Trump is whisked away from his border interview with News Nation.
[00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:39.338]  You can see what happens here.
[00:30:39.358 --> 00:30:40.238]  It's about a two minute clip.
[00:30:40.618 --> 00:30:49.399]  You can see that he seems to notice something, a verbal signal or a hand signal that something is amiss, and he abruptly ends the interview, citing that it's not safe for them to be there.
[00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:52.760]  It's a threat to their lives to remain there.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.181]  It's dangerous and encouraging the person interviewing him to leave the premises as well as he quickly and hastily leaves.
[00:30:59.241 --> 00:30:59.601]  Let's watch.
[00:31:01.101 --> 00:31:02.422]  Trump at the Arizona border.
[00:31:02.662 --> 00:31:07.725]  Trump visited the border as part of his swing state tour counter-programming the DNC.
[00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:15.591]  Also, the local sheriff's office in Cochise County is telling NewsNation they're looking for a man who made threats to kill the former president.
[00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:19.393]  They tried to arrest him last night but apparently could not find him.
[00:31:20.014 --> 00:31:22.335]  So they are still looking for him at this hour.
[00:31:22.616 --> 00:31:25.778]  NewsNation's Ali Bradley spoke with Trump just moments ago.
[00:31:25.838 --> 00:31:27.579]  She asked him about the border and that
[00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:39.624]  I'm gonna get to the border, but I obviously have to ask you about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:45.627]  If he endorses you, are you going to find a spot for him in your cabinet, and have you promised him anything in that regard?
[00:31:45.647 --> 00:31:48.929]  Well, we haven't talked about that yet, Ali, but we'll find out, and we'll see.
[00:31:48.989 --> 00:31:52.030]  I have a lot of respect for him, and I think he has a lot of respect for me.
[00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.810]  I've just heard this.
[00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:53.851]  There's news flashes.
[00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:58.294]  And, you know, we've had a good relationship for a long period of time.
[00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.696]  If he endorses, that would be an honor for me.
[00:32:01.116 --> 00:32:02.097]  But we're doing very well.
[00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:03.898]  We're leading now, as you know, in the election.
[00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:08.522]  And we're leading in all of the major categories, like border, like economy, like all of that.
[00:32:09.602 --> 00:32:10.183]  It's really good.
[00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:10.823]  It's really good.
[00:32:10.863 --> 00:32:12.164]  Things are happening that are very good.
[00:32:12.445 --> 00:32:13.565]  He may also see that.
[00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:15.127]  But it would be my great honor.
[00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:18.269]  If he wants to endorse me, I have good respect for him.
[00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.532]  Smart guy, a little different, but very smart.
[00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:23.213]  And we will take his endorsement.
[00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:25.695]  Can we expect to see him on the stage with you tomorrow?
[00:32:25.795 --> 00:32:26.375]  Well, I don't know.
[00:32:26.435 --> 00:32:28.858]  I know we're in the same state, but we're still pretty far away.
[00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:30.879]  But we'll see what happens.
[00:32:30.979 --> 00:32:32.681]  If something happens, you'll be the first to know.
[00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:33.401]  Thank you, sir.
[00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:33.942]  Thank you very much.
[00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:37.705]  Now, sir, I do have one question here about the situation in this area.
[00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:39.707]  Obviously, an assassin tried to kill you.
[00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:40.928]  Yeah, but you know what?
[00:32:40.948 --> 00:32:41.908]  Can I tell you something?
[00:32:41.928 --> 00:32:42.149]  Sure.
[00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:45.672]  We're in danger standing here talking, so let's not talk any longer.
[00:32:45.692 --> 00:32:48.514]  No, I know about it, but they don't want me standing here.
[00:32:48.554 --> 00:32:49.855]  They don't want you standing here either.
[00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:50.576]  Have a good time.
[00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:51.456]  Wow.
[00:32:51.676 --> 00:32:54.518]  So we are joined by the one and only Kamala Harris.
[00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:59.981]  It is an honor and a pleasure to have you here on the InfoWars Network on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.622]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:06.704]  Well, I didn't have a choice at this point, so it's the last night.
[00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:07.785]  Here I am.
[00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:09.206]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:09.226 --> 00:33:17.110]  What do you think about that clip where Donald Trump abruptly ended the interview, citing that there seemed to be some sort of a risk to his life?
[00:33:19.673 --> 00:33:21.614]  Yeah, he's always been very dramatic.
[00:33:22.415 --> 00:33:29.680]  I think it's more dangerous to try to build a wall to help keep people out.
[00:33:30.421 --> 00:33:31.782]  I'm a woman of the people, and I want
[00:33:36.394 --> 00:33:39.717]  I want the people from Mexico to feel free to come inside the country.
[00:33:39.957 --> 00:33:42.439]  So he's talking about keeping people out.
[00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:43.720]  He's so divisive.
[00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:49.946]  I'm sitting here telling Mexico that I'll take all their criminals, and he's telling them they're going to pay for the wall.
[00:33:50.026 --> 00:33:51.447]  I mean, the answer is obvious.
[00:33:55.464 --> 00:34:06.052]  Well, it's interesting that you're coming out with such antagonism for a wall, given that we're seeing reports footage on the ground outside the DNC that security is very high.
[00:34:06.072 --> 00:34:10.095]  You have to show proof of identification in order to get into the facility for these DNC events.
[00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:14.118]  And there are frankly riots going on and massive arrests going on outside.
[00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:18.262]  It seems like a wall is really maintaining the safety of the DNC this week.
[00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:19.743]  What are your thoughts about that?
[00:34:19.783 --> 00:34:22.525]  Why is it that a wall is okay for you at the DNC, but not for the country?
[00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:29.978]  Well, I'm important.
[00:34:30.138 --> 00:34:34.221]  But, you know, we have to keep ourselves safe, you know, just like you said, right?
[00:34:34.261 --> 00:34:40.326]  You know, we're demanding, you know, we're demanding ID and, you know, that kind of stuff is necessary to keep us safe.
[00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:49.033]  It's not necessary for things like voting, you know, but for safety reasons, primarily for the DNC, you know, that's how we operate everything, right?
[00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:53.756]  You know, I have bodyguards, they have guns, but, you know, I'll snatch all of yours away.
[00:34:56.542 --> 00:34:56.862]  Wow.
[00:34:57.143 --> 00:34:57.603]  Unbelievable.
[00:34:57.623 --> 00:35:02.827]  Now, in anticipation of your visit on our network, and again, we honor and a pleasure to have you.
[00:35:02.907 --> 00:35:04.008]  Obviously, you're very busy tonight.
[00:35:04.028 --> 00:35:04.909]  It's a big night for you.
[00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:13.456]  We did reach out to our audience to ask them if they had any questions that they'd like us to ask you, since we're going to have about another five or 10 minutes with you.
[00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:17.499]  And I just want to go ahead and field some kind of spontaneous questions for you.
[00:35:17.519 --> 00:35:17.880]  Is that okay?
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.580]  Are you comfortable with that?
[00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:20.101]  Oh, yeah.
[00:35:20.141 --> 00:35:20.322]  Yeah.
[00:35:20.362 --> 00:35:20.802]  Go for it.
[00:35:21.013 --> 00:35:21.273]  Okay.
[00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:25.174]  One of the questions from one of our listeners was a philosophical question.
[00:35:25.874 --> 00:35:28.455]  Is it better to reign in hell or to serve on your knees?
[00:35:31.315 --> 00:35:32.175]  Um, you know what?
[00:35:32.855 --> 00:35:36.556]  With a good pair of, you know, with a good pair of knee pads, you know, you can make that work.
[00:35:36.596 --> 00:35:37.876]  So definitely on your knees.
[00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:41.417]  It gets you, you know, it gets you into good positions of power if you do it right, right?
[00:35:42.537 --> 00:35:43.498]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:43.878 --> 00:35:44.278]  Absolutely.
[00:35:44.558 --> 00:35:50.639]  Did Pelosi tell you that she would initiate a coup on your behalf or was that just a pleasant surprise?
[00:35:52.574 --> 00:35:54.295]  That was a very pleasant surprise.
[00:35:54.415 --> 00:36:01.477]  I didn't think she'd come around to it, but I told her something about the capital gains tax.
[00:36:01.577 --> 00:36:02.497]  She went ballistic.
[00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:04.138]  We made a little compromise.
[00:36:04.418 --> 00:36:09.399]  I'm going to exempt her from it so she can continue insider trading and she got me the presidential seat.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:10.800]  Absolutely.
[00:36:12.566 --> 00:36:14.327]  Joy has been a major theme of your campaign.
[00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:23.109]  Some critics are saying that the use of the word joy so incessantly is really a reminder of Mao.
[00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:26.170]  Chairman Mao used joy for a lot of his slogans, things of that nature.
[00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.311]  Tim Walz, of course, has been in China dozens of times.
[00:36:29.531 --> 00:36:32.492]  Former students are saying that he was a Maoist to the core back in 1995 when they went with him.
[00:36:33.872 --> 00:36:36.973]  But what do you think about the notion of joy?
[00:36:36.993 --> 00:36:39.713]  And what do you say to people who make fun of your laugh?
[00:36:39.793 --> 00:36:40.633]  Is this a joy thing?
[00:36:40.653 --> 00:36:41.653]  Is it a communist thing?
[00:36:41.713 --> 00:36:46.094]  Or is it just so that when people see you cackle, they think of the word joy instead of insane?
[00:36:48.294 --> 00:36:48.535]  Yeah.
[00:36:48.595 --> 00:36:50.635]  So, you know, we're in the middle of rebranding, right?
[00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:56.856]  So, you know, for three and a half years, you know, for whatever reason, my joy wasn't resonating with the American public.
[00:36:57.976 --> 00:36:58.996]  And I can't imagine why.
[00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:02.857]  But, you know, now,
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.162]  Now we're pushing it more towards, you know, I want to be, you know, I want to be relatable.
[00:37:07.763 --> 00:37:15.007]  And, you know, I guess in a way we want people to start feeling comfortable, you know, with the ideas of communism.
[00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:24.513]  And, you know, as long as you talk about spreading joy, no matter how miserable those populations are, they're going to feel and believe that they're joyful as well.
[00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:27.635]  You know, these are psychological tactics that are above your pay grade.
[00:37:27.756 --> 00:37:27.956]  All right.
[00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:29.717]  If you get into politics, you'll understand.
[00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:31.517]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:31.557 --> 00:37:35.499]  Well, I've got a lot to learn and I'm so glad that you're here to help educate me and the audience.
[00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:46.645]  Obviously, InfoWars has been under a lot of fire over the years and, you know, we've been likened by Hillary Clinton and others to the basket of deplorables, been associated with conspiracy theories by Barack Obama.
[00:37:47.726 --> 00:37:49.967]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:51.388]  What do you think about InfoWars?
[00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:53.469]  I mean, obviously, it's so nice of you to be here.
[00:37:53.549 --> 00:37:57.371]  So many in your party are reluctant to do an interview like this.
[00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:01.736]  You know, Alex Jones, he's adorable.
[00:38:01.776 --> 00:38:02.816]  He reminds me of Joe.
[00:38:02.856 --> 00:38:05.657]  They both kind of just, you know, scream spontaneously.
[00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:08.759]  Alex just happens to be, you know, of a whiter birth.
[00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:12.340]  But, um, you know, yeah, I think he's great.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:21.063]  He kind of looks like the, you know, we, we let him stay on the air so that, you know, we can just point to him and say, you know, Oh no, don't listen to the crazy guy.
[00:38:23.844 --> 00:38:25.605]  But you know, yeah, I think you guys are great.
[00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:27.150]  Well, thank you so much for that.
[00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:35.740]  Now, we're looking at the schedule for the DNC tonight, and there are going to be a lot of speakers who are speaking on gun safety, gun reform, which is an important issue for the Democratic Party, certainly.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:43.009]  Obviously, the Republican Party doesn't want any reform whatsoever, other than maybe reforms that would allow us to have rocket launchers and things like that wherever we wanted.
[00:38:43.509 --> 00:38:46.253]  But did your perspective change at all on gun control?
[00:38:46.713 --> 00:38:56.600]  When it was reported that the assassin, the would-be assassin actually used an AR-15, did you have a more favorable perspective on assault rifles?
[00:38:58.461 --> 00:38:58.621]  No.
[00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.283]  We're sticking with rules for me and not for thee.
[00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:06.967]  It's very difficult to try to snatch everyone's guns away unless we stick to it.
[00:39:07.307 --> 00:39:11.090]  Like I said to you in the beginning, it's important to protect
[00:39:12.003 --> 00:39:15.144]  Certain people, you know, there's a duality in these things, right?
[00:39:15.224 --> 00:39:18.706]  You know, you should look that word up and, you know, text me the definition later.
[00:39:18.726 --> 00:39:21.207]  But, you know, there's a duality here.
[00:39:21.607 --> 00:39:25.569]  And, you know, it's very important that, you know, we have safety.
[00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:33.232]  And, you know, if we take those away and make them illegal, then there's not a shot in hell anyone's going to get their hands on them, right?
[00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:34.532]  It's just common sense, Harrison.
[00:39:38.283 --> 00:39:42.745]  So, obviously, Joe's cognitive decline has been a topic of conversation.
[00:39:43.045 --> 00:39:48.528]  The debate on June 27th was really the catalyst for his political demise and early retirement.
[00:39:48.568 --> 00:39:52.010]  You know, he's got a lot of life left in him, but an unfortunate early retirement.
[00:39:52.530 --> 00:40:02.395]  Do you think that if Joe Biden had had access to products like Brain Force Ultra from Infowarsstore.com, maybe he would have been able to stick it out another four years as president of the United States?
[00:40:02.435 --> 00:40:03.256]  Or has he just done so?
[00:40:03.316 --> 00:40:03.796]  It's time for you.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:11.525]  If he would have taken them, you know, about three and a half years ago when this all started, I think it would absolutely have been beneficial.
[00:40:11.665 --> 00:40:16.229]  But, you know, with all the shots and all the stuff that we've given him, you know, his liver is taking quite a hit.
[00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:17.911]  So I can't speak on now.
[00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:22.875]  But, you know, again, you have to think about the duality of these things, right?
[00:40:22.935 --> 00:40:24.557]  And there is a duality to Joe.
[00:40:25.077 --> 00:40:26.959]  You know, he is weak and fragile.
[00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:31.000]  But no matter how many times, you know, we tried, you know, we tried to get rid of him.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.981]  You know, he's resilient.
[00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:34.184]  He pops right back up every time he falls.
[00:40:34.264 --> 00:40:39.069]  So, you know, the duality of Joseph is really quite complex.
[00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:46.676]  And, you know, hopefully we can, you know, unburden what has been and usher him out so I can just really take front and center before even the election.
[00:40:48.923 --> 00:40:50.024]  That's the plan.
[00:40:50.064 --> 00:40:50.884]  Don't tell anyone.
[00:40:51.064 --> 00:40:55.947]  Do you anticipate that you'll be president of the United States before the end of his term?
[00:40:55.967 --> 00:40:59.529]  Do you think he'll resign the presidency before the election, the next inauguration?
[00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.872]  I'll put it to you this way since we're live, right?
[00:41:05.353 --> 00:41:08.835]  The tickle that I feel in my ovaries tells me yes.
[00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:10.055]  Tells me yes.
[00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:11.816]  I mean, that seat is already mine.
[00:41:11.916 --> 00:41:13.517]  I can taste it, right?
[00:41:13.577 --> 00:41:15.959]  And I've done a lot of tasting to get here.
[00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:17.740]  So it only makes sense
[00:41:18.686 --> 00:41:21.068]  That, you know, I am the rightful owner of that chair.
[00:41:21.468 --> 00:41:24.130]  And at this point, you know, it's real life Game of Thrones.
[00:41:25.891 --> 00:41:26.732]  Call me Cersei.
[00:41:29.734 --> 00:41:30.235]  Absolutely.
[00:41:30.255 --> 00:41:31.395]  Well, thank you so much for being here.
[00:41:31.415 --> 00:41:32.716]  It's been an honor and a pleasure to have you.
[00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:37.900]  We know that you're busy, so we're going to let you get back to preparing for this speech that you're going to give that somebody else wrote.
[00:41:38.641 --> 00:41:44.445]  But before you go, can you please let the audience know where they can find you and follow you and support you?
[00:41:45.655 --> 00:41:46.195]  Absolutely.
[00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:53.898]  MommyRN88, across the board, X, YouTube, IG, and, uh, what's the last one?
[00:41:54.258 --> 00:41:54.738]  TikTok.
[00:41:54.818 --> 00:41:56.678]  But, you know, that one's probably going to go away soon.
[00:41:57.879 --> 00:41:59.039]  Well, it's been an honor and pleasure to have you.
[00:41:59.059 --> 00:41:59.659]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:59.699 --> 00:42:00.960]  I really enjoyed our conversation.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.820]  You're welcome back anytime as far as I'm concerned.
[00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:08.782]  Wow, folks, that is Kamala Harris on the air on InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:09.463 --> 00:42:10.383]  What a groundbreaking moment.
[00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:10.983]  I'm just honored.
[00:42:11.003 --> 00:42:13.324]  I've only been here since July of last year.
[00:42:14.704 --> 00:42:20.709]  I'm just honored that I get to be the person to interview Kamala Harris on InfoWars after all the decades that Alex Jones has put in.
[00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:22.111]  She said very nice things about Alex.
[00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:29.797]  She said good things about our products, even implying that it could have cured Joe Biden of his illness if he would have had some brain force ultra three and a half years ago.
[00:42:29.837 --> 00:42:39.825]  But unfortunately, it is too late, and that's why you do need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get these products while you're still healthy so you can bolster that health and maintain it in these uncertain times.
[00:42:39.885 --> 00:42:41.827]  Now we are going to have some more coverage.
[00:42:41.847 --> 00:42:42.447]  We are going to have some
[00:42:43.308 --> 00:42:46.429]  Some guests and Rex Jones is going to be joining us in about 15 minutes.
[00:42:46.489 --> 00:42:49.530]  In the meantime, I do want to show you the report from this morning.
[00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:54.131]  This is clip number three of Jones talking about Trump's assassination.
[00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:57.052]  And this is all in the context of this interview today.
[00:42:57.072 --> 00:43:04.174]  I just want you to see for yourselves what Alex has been saying, what happened, and then we'll unpack it on the other side.
[00:43:07.976 --> 00:43:08.796]  Clip number three, please.
[00:43:09.414 --> 00:43:15.799]  With only 75 days left to the election and the Deep State desperate, President Trump's life has never been in more danger.
[00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:17.240]  But not from Iran.
[00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:22.723]  The Deep State is preparing another attempt on President Trump's life.
[00:43:22.843 --> 00:43:27.166]  And this time, they're going to frame Iran for it.
[00:43:33.031 --> 00:43:33.811]  InfoWars.
[00:43:34.151 --> 00:43:35.813]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:43:37.374 --> 00:43:38.955]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:43:40.162 --> 00:43:42.843]  President Trump's life is in serious danger.
[00:43:43.924 --> 00:43:50.768]  The deep state already tried to kill him and failed on July 13th of this year, just 40-something days ago.
[00:43:51.628 --> 00:44:00.112]  And two days after it happened, I came out and said, the deep state is going to try again, and they're going to try to frame Iran.
[00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:03.714]  And now they are officially doing it.
[00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:08.577]  The big move is to hit him with a large truck bomb.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.063]  Again, it's in the cards to use a small nuclear weapon and blame the Iranians.
[00:44:14.304 --> 00:44:15.265]  They'll be the fall guys.
[00:44:16.326 --> 00:44:18.188]  And then instantly, we're in full war with Russia.
[00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.010]  Instantly, the air raid sirens are going off.
[00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.212]  Instantly, life as you know it is over.
[00:44:24.173 --> 00:44:34.502]  And they're going to use the war to try to get Americans to, oh my god, you know, we got hit by a nuke, Iran, Iran, you know, with Russia, you know, and then everybody's off the air except the corporate niche.
[00:44:36.411 --> 00:44:42.596]  Then you're going to see all hell break loose because there are people inside all those corporate news organizations and inside the government that are our people.
[00:44:43.217 --> 00:44:44.618]  Everyone's going to know it's the Deep State.
[00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:45.959]  They're not going to be able to blame it on Iran.
[00:44:45.979 --> 00:44:46.819]  That's who they're going to do it.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.081]  That's who they're going to blame it on.
[00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:50.402]  And I know there are scenarios.
[00:44:52.364 --> 00:44:53.905]  And so it's not alarmist to say this.
[00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:58.028]  And I think we need to really get on the table out front to the globalists.
[00:44:58.489 --> 00:44:59.389]  We know your plans.
[00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.310]  We know your operations.
[00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.091]  We know your history.
[00:45:02.288 --> 00:45:05.989]  And again, what do they do to get the sympathy back or to change the subject?
[00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.390]  Some horrible event.
[00:45:08.871 --> 00:45:13.712]  And again, if their next assassination attempt fails, if they're unable to poison him, that's the default.
[00:45:13.732 --> 00:45:14.573]  They're gonna try to poison him.
[00:45:15.453 --> 00:45:28.118]  And if they can't get a shooter in, and if they can't get a truck bomb in close enough, if they put the barricades far enough back in Milwaukee, they're gonna wait till he's back in Mar-a-Lago or somewhere and roll a truck bomb in there.
[00:45:28.578 --> 00:45:28.938]  Guaranteed.
[00:45:30.217 --> 00:45:31.718]  And say the Iranians did it.
[00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:34.440]  Now that's just one example of dozens.
[00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:48.371]  Just days after I predicted it, and then a few days after I predicted that, four days after he got grazed in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI came out and said, we have credible threats at the mulas.
[00:45:49.412 --> 00:45:54.097]  Over in Iran, the Ayatollah is trying to kill Trump and might have been involved.
[00:45:54.658 --> 00:45:57.360]  Oh, did the mullahs have the Secret Service stand down?
[00:45:58.001 --> 00:45:59.763]  Did they pull most of the security off?
[00:46:00.604 --> 00:46:08.392]  Did the mullahs have the Secret Service not point the man out on the roof for over 26 minutes or 90 minutes down below with a rangefinder?
[00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.212]  Now we know a rifle.
[00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:12.115]  Man, those mullahs have magical powers.
[00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:28.298]  So now, there's an article in Newsmax, similar propaganda everywhere, from conservative media we can trust, that, oh absolutely, there's a big plot to kill Trump, and the Ayatollah wants him dead before the election.
[00:46:28.779 --> 00:46:31.220]  I wonder who else wants him dead before the election.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:41.986]  And Trump really fell into this trap when Netanyahu spoke to Congress a few weeks ago, and said the Mullahs are going to try to kill Trump, and Trump said on Truth Social, well if they kill me, destroy Iran!
[00:46:43.595 --> 00:46:45.416]  They actually sent death squads.
[00:46:46.496 --> 00:46:52.299]  They sent death squads here to murder a former Secretary of State and a former National Security Advisor.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.602]  And as we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President Trump.
[00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:07.305]  You have Homeland Security, you have the whole DHS, FBI, Secret Service system, fingerprints all over the attempted assassination.
[00:47:07.665 --> 00:47:09.087]  The Deep State wants Trump gone.
[00:47:09.728 --> 00:47:14.334]  And now Israel's saying, well, if Trump gets killed, it's Iran's fault.
[00:47:14.374 --> 00:47:16.677]  And Trump goes, yeah, if I get killed, blow up Iran.
[00:47:17.423 --> 00:47:26.990]  President Trump, you're digging your own grave, inviting the deep state to kill you so they can attack Iran, keep you out of office, and clamp down on the American people.
[00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.511]  This is absolutely insane.
[00:47:29.852 --> 00:47:31.533]  And it's not like I'm pointing this out now.
[00:47:32.794 --> 00:47:39.118]  I pointed it out before they even put out their propaganda because I study them and I'm many steps ahead of them.
[00:47:39.538 --> 00:47:42.981]  Again, if I hadn't even predicted this days before they started this,
[00:47:43.976 --> 00:47:50.480]  And they came out and said this now, it's obvious that they weren't involved, the Iranians, in the attempted assassination of Trump back in July.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:58.044]  But the fact that they're trying to sell this right now is very, very, extremely ominous and dangerous.
[00:47:59.024 --> 00:48:01.066]  And you know, that's a little bit old, that chart.
[00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:06.929]  That chart's a couple of months old, and if you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[00:48:15.154 --> 00:48:19.257]  And finally, Iran came out a month ago and said, we don't want Trump dead.
[00:48:19.637 --> 00:48:20.938]  We're not involved in your elections.
[00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:22.719]  We're not trying to assassinate him.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.920]  We don't want war.
[00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:26.782]  Israel just killed the two leaders of Hamas.
[00:48:27.283 --> 00:48:29.024]  Iran didn't even strike back.
[00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:31.365]  Iran is being very, very cautious.
[00:48:31.425 --> 00:48:32.426]  I'm not a fan of the mullahs.
[00:48:32.466 --> 00:48:34.568]  I'm just simply saying they understand
[00:48:35.168 --> 00:48:36.029]  We're good to go.
[00:48:59.244 --> 00:49:00.365]  You know they're going to try it again.
[00:49:00.945 --> 00:49:02.586]  They've already given us their cover story.
[00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:04.347]  Are we really this stupid to buy it?
[00:49:04.868 --> 00:49:07.529]  President Trump's life is in grave danger.
[00:49:17.836 --> 00:49:19.436]  At InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:49:19.476 --> 00:49:21.257]  Please remember to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:21.797 --> 00:49:26.238]  Rex Jones will be joining me any minute here as the DNC is ramping up and we get picture in picture.
[00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:28.038]  I want to see if that marching band is still playing.
[00:49:28.318 --> 00:49:38.861]  I'd like to give the audience a little bit of taste of the finale, the ultimate installment, the final act of the DNC, just to give them a sense of how the leftists are wrapping this up.
[00:49:38.881 --> 00:49:39.701]  Let's go ahead and play some of this.
[00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:04.068]  Oh, wonderful.
[00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:07.552]  She's drumming upside down.
[00:50:10.455 --> 00:50:10.715]  Or he.
[00:50:10.736 --> 00:50:12.518]  You can't tell these days, can you?
[00:50:15.862 --> 00:50:16.843]  I can't believe they got J.P.
[00:50:16.863 --> 00:50:17.684]  Sears to agree to do that.
[00:50:22.054 --> 00:50:23.996]  Wow, so tonight it's all American flags.
[00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:31.866]  They're doubling down on the arms race, the populist arms race, trying to convey that they're the real patriots, that they're the real party for the people.
[00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:33.608]  Kamala Harris for the people.
[00:50:33.648 --> 00:50:40.356]  They've used terms like joy and people over and over again because they're trying to steal populism from the right.
[00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:44.139]  And make it their own and reclaim it.
[00:50:44.259 --> 00:50:47.541]  And Steve Bannon predicted this back in 2017 when he did the monk debates.
[00:50:47.982 --> 00:50:52.205]  He said that it's not a question of whether or not the future is populism.
[00:50:52.685 --> 00:50:57.969]  The question is whether it's populist socialism or populist nationalism.
[00:50:58.449 --> 00:51:02.592]  Which I like to refer to as populist patriotism or populist capitalism.
[00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:28.747]  And right now what we're seeing is the Kamala Harris campaign stealing all of, some of the best policies, I don't want to say all of the best policies, stealing from some of the most popular policies from the Trump campaign, which are populist policies, rebranding them, claiming them for their own, and instituting socialist variations or interpretations of populism that are antithetical to the success, health, or well-being of the American people.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.682]  In order to try to steal the populist momentum that is behind Trump.
[00:51:32.702 --> 00:51:36.425]  So for so long, they fought so hard against the notion of populism.
[00:51:36.746 --> 00:51:44.933]  It was just a couple of months ago that Nancy Pelosi did a debate where she said that populism itself was antithetical or antagonistic toward democracy.
[00:51:44.953 --> 00:51:49.657]  I think she used the words, populism is a threat to democracy, which is like amazing.
[00:51:50.037 --> 00:51:52.138]  That anybody would have the audacity to make a claim like that.
[00:51:52.218 --> 00:51:59.299]  I mean, populism literally just means power in the hands of the people or the people represented instead of the political class represented.
[00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:00.680]  It's not about left versus right.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.060]  It's about the people versus the political class, right?
[00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:09.742]  And so we have Nancy Pelosi just a couple of months ago talking about how populism is a threat to democracy.
[00:52:10.082 --> 00:52:18.644]  Now we have the DNC, the entire Kamala Harris campaign, the entire establishment and machine behind them laundering money through organizations like ActBlue and others
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.281]  Using populist rhetoric.
[00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:22.181]  Waving the U.S.
[00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:29.185]  flag at a time when they're accustomed to waving Ukrainian flags or Palestinian flags or Taiwanese flags.
[00:52:29.225 --> 00:52:30.166]  Any flag but the U.S.
[00:52:30.206 --> 00:52:30.506]  flag.
[00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:30.786]  The U.S.
[00:52:30.806 --> 00:52:37.590]  flag is a symbol of America's former greatness and we're against making America great again because America was never great.
[00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:38.511]  That's their whole mentality.
[00:52:38.791 --> 00:52:40.172]  Yet they're waving the flag.
[00:52:40.432 --> 00:52:41.973]  They're saying Kamala for the people.
[00:52:42.213 --> 00:52:46.576]  They're taking popular policies from Trump like no tax on tips and other policies.
[00:52:47.642 --> 00:52:48.322]  Thanks for watching.
[00:53:03.148 --> 00:53:03.988]  We're good to go.
[00:53:25.698 --> 00:53:39.964]  So I would love to thank Donald Trump for giving us this invitation to be here and to say a few words to the staff has been so kind to help us in this very hard time.
[00:53:41.944 --> 00:53:43.545]  My daughter was just 12.
[00:53:44.545 --> 00:53:47.306]  She had dreams to be famous.
[00:53:47.406 --> 00:53:49.047]  She wanted to be a famous actor.
[00:53:49.347 --> 00:53:50.848]  She was so funny.
[00:53:51.088 --> 00:53:53.069]  She was her own personality.
[00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.929]  And, um,
[00:53:58.157 --> 00:53:59.117]  It's been very hard.
[00:53:59.197 --> 00:54:00.298]  It's been very hard.
[00:54:02.578 --> 00:54:05.019]  June 17th was the day her life was taken.
[00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:21.904]  She was left with no clothing from the waist down, was thrown in a bayou, left... was strangled to death.
[00:54:23.806 --> 00:54:40.980]  We believe, yes, she was assaulted off of DNA kit that has been, but it's still very, very early, and it's still very, very raw, and it's still very, very surreal, and they have no
[00:54:42.116 --> 00:54:45.097]  They had no reason to do anything that they did to Jocelyn.
[00:54:45.797 --> 00:54:54.300]  There was over 300 detention beds that they should have been at because they were detained and they were released when they shouldn't have been released.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.100]  One had an ankle monitor.
[00:54:58.021 --> 00:54:59.281]  Didn't stop anything.
[00:55:01.082 --> 00:55:05.383]  So now I have to go through the rest of my life with my son.
[00:55:06.983 --> 00:55:08.604]  Always asking for his sister.
[00:55:10.638 --> 00:55:29.626]  And I just really, really, really want everybody to please take into consideration how important border control is because we're losing very innocent people to heinous crimes that shouldn't be happening in the first place.
[00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:38.610]  So please, please, I really hope everybody can hear my pain to just
[00:55:41.147 --> 00:55:41.987]  Please, please.
[00:55:42.968 --> 00:55:46.009]  He needs to be in office and we need better control.
[00:55:46.049 --> 00:55:47.050]  We need to stop this.
[00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.771]  We need to stop losing our littles.
[00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:54.013]  We need to stop losing children, mothers, sisters.
[00:55:55.594 --> 00:55:58.295]  Because now I get to grieve every single day.
[00:55:59.536 --> 00:56:04.819]  Every milestone that hits gets harder because she's not there for it.
[00:56:05.679 --> 00:56:07.060]  She was going to be a 7th grader.
[00:56:08.772 --> 00:56:10.533]  She had her whole life ahead of her.
[00:56:10.553 --> 00:56:15.275]  Her whole life ahead of her, and it was viciously taken away by two evil, evil, heinous monsters.
[00:56:15.295 --> 00:56:16.555]  So thank you again for taking the time to listen to my words.
[00:56:16.595 --> 00:56:17.596]  And please, help him make a change.
[00:56:17.616 --> 00:56:17.796]  Thank you.
[00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:18.456]  Thank you.
[00:56:18.476 --> 00:56:18.876]  Thank you.
[00:56:18.957 --> 00:56:19.217]  Thank you.
[00:56:20.157 --> 00:56:20.437]  Thank you.
[00:56:20.457 --> 00:56:20.637]  Thank you.
[00:56:20.737 --> 00:56:21.017]  Thank you.
[00:56:21.037 --> 00:56:21.278]  Thank you.
[00:56:21.298 --> 00:56:21.638]  Thank you.
[00:56:21.658 --> 00:56:21.858]  Thank you.
[00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:22.178]  Thank you.
[00:56:22.198 --> 00:56:22.398]  Thank you.
[00:56:22.478 --> 00:56:22.798]  Thank you.
[00:56:22.818 --> 00:56:23.198]  Thank you.
[00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:23.498]  Thank you.
[00:56:23.559 --> 00:56:23.919]  Thank you.
[00:56:23.939 --> 00:56:24.259]  Thank you.
[00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:25.459]  Thank you.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:26.300]  Thank you.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:26.580]  Thank you.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:26.960]  Thank you.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.280]  Thank you.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:27.540]  Thank you.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.000]  Thank you.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.341]  Thank you.
[00:56:28.401 --> 00:56:28.601]  Thank you.
[00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:28.841]  Thank you.
[00:56:28.861 --> 00:56:29.041]  Thank you.
[00:56:29.061 --> 00:56:29.281]  Thank you.
[00:56:29.341 --> 00:56:29.721]  Thank you.
[00:56:30.522 --> 00:56:30.782]  Thank you.
[00:56:30.802 --> 00:56:31.222]  Thank you.
[00:56:31.242 --> 00:56:31.522]  Thank you.
[00:56:32.182 --> 00:56:32.362]  Thank you.
[00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:32.763]  Thank you.
[00:56:32.843 --> 00:56:33.023]  Thank you.
[00:56:33.043 --> 00:56:33.243]  Thank you.
[00:56:33.263 --> 00:56:33.443]  Thank you.
[00:56:33.683 --> 00:56:33.863]  Thank you.
[00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:34.163]  Thank you.
[00:56:34.203 --> 00:56:34.443]  Thank you.
[00:56:34.483 --> 00:56:34.703]  Thank you.
[00:56:34.723 --> 00:56:34.904]  Thank you.
[00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:35.184]  Thank you.
[00:56:35.204 --> 00:56:35.464]  Thank you.
[00:56:35.524 --> 00:56:35.784]  Thank you.
[00:56:35.804 --> 00:56:36.024]  Thank you.
[00:56:36.044 --> 00:56:36.224]  Thank you.
[00:56:36.244 --> 00:56:36.424]  Thank you.
[00:56:36.444 --> 00:56:36.684]  Thank you.
[00:56:36.724 --> 00:56:37.024]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.044 --> 00:56:37.245]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.265 --> 00:56:37.445]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.465 --> 00:56:37.745]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.765 --> 00:56:37.965]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.985 --> 00:56:38.165]  Thank you.
[00:56:40.459 --> 00:57:00.405]  And while the humanitarian crisis, and it is just that, the humanitarian crisis on the border goes unnoticed and untended by the leftists, while they send billions upon billions of your own dollars overseas to war after war after war, current, past, and future, for the sake of the humanitarian crisis somewhere else,
[00:57:02.062 --> 00:57:11.508]  We have Republican so called Republican leaders with the gall to switch teams on behalf of the corporate political class.
[00:57:12.169 --> 00:57:19.053]  Spending $500,000 to $2.5 million apiece for box seats at the DNC.
[00:57:19.514 --> 00:57:26.979]  The real rulers at the top of the stadium, looking down upon the people and controlling the politicians on stage like puppets.
[00:57:27.279 --> 00:57:31.662]  We have leaders from our own side, supposedly from our own side, including Adam Kinzinger.
[00:57:32.563 --> 00:57:45.636]  Who is speaking tonight, just three speakers ahead or two speakers ahead of Kamala Harris, a so-called Republican who betrayed us, who sat on the January 6th committee and lied and lied and lied.
[00:57:46.237 --> 00:57:47.658]  He's from where I grew up.
[00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:54.666]  My family knew him and was excited about him and supported him, and he totally betrayed us.
[00:57:56.325 --> 00:58:00.727]  Well, these crises on the border are allowed to happen, and Donald Trump has prevented at all costs.
[00:58:00.747 --> 00:58:02.188]  I mean, they tried to kill him on July 13th.
[00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:03.068]  They've tried to imprison him.
[00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:05.429]  They might succeed in doing so when they sentence him in September.
[00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:08.270]  They tried to censor him, silence him, cancel him.
[00:58:09.711 --> 00:58:18.195]  And they've attacked anybody that's been remotely associated with assisting in his victory in 2016, whether it's Milo Yiannopoulos or Alex Jones.
[00:58:19.735 --> 00:58:20.576]  And countless others.
[00:58:21.792 --> 00:58:32.174]  Not even counting the January six protesters who were entrapped and going into a building and minding the velvet ropes by federal operatives who were not themselves prosecuted.
[00:58:32.194 --> 00:58:35.515]  I won't name any specific names, but I'm sure you understand who comes to mind.
[00:58:38.375 --> 00:58:39.936]  And Kinzinger's not the only one.
[00:58:39.956 --> 00:58:41.236]  I mean, there's countless examples of this.
[00:58:41.316 --> 00:58:46.157]  Cruz opponent Allred tries to thread the needle with Democratic convention appearance, apparently.
[00:58:47.797 --> 00:58:49.738]  Representative Colin Allred, Democrat from Texas.
[00:58:50.819 --> 00:59:00.525]  Who is locked in a tight Senate race against Texas Senator Ted Cruz is trying to thread the needle by appearing at the Democratic National Convention to rally voters for Vice President Harris.
[00:59:00.565 --> 00:59:03.187]  Now he wasn't formally a Republican.
[00:59:03.207 --> 00:59:04.488]  He's an opponent of Ted Cruz.
[00:59:04.548 --> 00:59:15.295]  It makes sense that he would do this, but this is a. Former professional football player, Colin Allred, born in 1983, an American politician, lawyer and former professional.
[00:59:16.459 --> 00:59:19.603]  Football player, a member of the Democratic Party, U.S.
[00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:22.386]  Representative from Texas, 32nd congressional district.
[00:59:23.908 --> 00:59:26.111]  He was a linebacker who played for the Tennessee Titans.
[00:59:26.431 --> 00:59:27.953]  I lived in Nashville for seven years.
[00:59:28.614 --> 00:59:30.276]  It's a shame to see this.
[00:59:30.476 --> 00:59:32.439]  Let's look at clip number 10 that just kind of breaks this down.
[00:59:42.168 --> 00:59:45.390]  So, we bring out Hulk Hogan and think, alright, we need a tough masculine guy too.
[00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.130]  They bring out a former NFL star.
[00:59:48.211 --> 00:59:53.053]  A congressman from Dallas, dad to two perfect little boys.
[00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:56.475]  And this November, I'm gonna beat Ted Cruz.
[01:00:01.937 --> 01:00:07.080]  And I'm so proud to be here to support our next president, Kamala Harris.
[01:00:08.783 --> 01:00:11.624]  You know, like Kamala, I was raised by a single mom.
[01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:16.566]  Mom was a public school teacher who often worked two jobs to make ends meet.
[01:00:17.726 --> 01:00:25.589]  So when we talk about lowering costs, I think about the times when we went to the grocery store when I was growing up and swiped the debit card and said a little prayer.
[01:00:26.649 --> 01:00:32.231]  But my mom and my community in Texas gave me a chance to chase my version of the American dream.
[01:00:33.191 --> 01:00:35.732]  I played football at Baylor and in the NFL.
[01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:41.495]  Before becoming a civil rights lawyer, representing my hometown in Congress.
[01:00:42.736 --> 01:00:45.719]  Now I'm the guy who's going to turn Texas' Senate seat blue.
[01:00:45.739 --> 01:00:57.629]  You know, in the NFL, we had a term for guys like Donald Trump and my opponent Ted Cruz.
[01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.051]  Me guys.
[01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:00.820]  You know the type.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.825]  Talk a big game, only care about themselves, but you don't want to be stuck with them at a barbecue.
[01:01:08.427 --> 01:01:11.550]  The truth is, America has never been about me.
[01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:17.896]  As President Obama said, the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word we.
[01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:19.878]  We the people.
[01:01:21.099 --> 01:01:22.280]  We shall overcome.
[01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:24.262]  Yes, we can.
[01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:27.287]  So collectivism.
[01:01:27.387 --> 01:01:28.748]  It's all we, we, we, we, we.
[01:01:28.788 --> 01:01:29.849]  They don't believe in the individual.
[01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:31.970]  They only believe in the group, the collective, the mob.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.052]  We will protect and restore reproductive freedom.
[01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:37.754]  We will secure the border.
[01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.716]  We'll protect Medicare and Social Security.
[01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:44.258]  And we'll turn the page and write a new chapter for this country.
[01:01:44.699 --> 01:01:48.141]  And elect Kamala Harris to be the next president and beat Ted Cruz.
[01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:49.482]  Thank y'all so much.
[01:01:50.042 --> 01:01:50.843]  God bless you.
[01:01:51.063 --> 01:01:52.404]  And may God bless Texas.
[01:01:57.315 --> 01:01:58.095]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:16.639]  They're trying to bring their brawn, despite the fact that Dana Bash and others basically admitted on CNN and other networks that the aim of the Democrats is to win over the Cuck beta boys, the soy boys, because the toxic men won't vote for Kamala Harris anyway, because she's a woman and they're all bigoted, misogynistic people.
[01:02:17.019 --> 01:02:19.219]  And so we have to target the Cuck betas.
[01:02:19.679 --> 01:02:20.739]  It's basically what she said.
[01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:23.360]  She, of course, didn't say it like that, but that's basically what she said.
[01:02:24.773 --> 01:02:26.174]  But we know who their real audience is.
[01:02:26.274 --> 01:02:27.594]  We know who they're really targeting.
[01:02:28.534 --> 01:02:30.755]  And Chris Cuomo did an outstanding job of breaking it down.
[01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:32.196]  I still have mixed feelings about him.
[01:02:32.276 --> 01:02:39.238]  Obviously he was willing to be paid to lie if he is saying things like this now so shortly after he has abandoned himself by the left.
[01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:46.561]  But it seems to me that he's actually speaking what he really thinks now that he's not being paid by the left to lie in this clip right here.
[01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:49.522]  It's abundantly obvious what's really going on, who the audience really is.
[01:02:49.542 --> 01:02:53.664]  A big theme here at the DNC.
[01:02:54.927 --> 01:02:56.769]  Is that they're going to go after corporate gouging.
[01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:59.090]  And they're going to go after corporations.
[01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:02.673]  Whether it's in taxes, largesse, loopholes.
[01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.855]  The RNC, we heard the same thing.
[01:03:04.895 --> 01:03:06.016]  They're going after the elites.
[01:03:06.556 --> 01:03:07.577]  The two sets of rules.
[01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:12.180]  Let me reveal a reality to you that has to be spoken to here, okay?
[01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:13.902]  These are the soldiers.
[01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:18.666]  These are the men and the women that go back to their constituencies and their communities and they fight.
[01:03:18.706 --> 01:03:19.747]  They take time from their jobs.
[01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:21.008]  They take time from their families.
[01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:23.850]  Republicans and Democrats alike, that's what they do.
[01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.531]  They need to charge these people up.
[01:03:25.571 --> 01:03:27.353]  They need to be able to get them on board.
[01:03:27.693 --> 01:03:31.076]  But there is another reality that is literally looking down on them.
[01:03:31.456 --> 01:03:33.638]  Greg, look at the ring of suites, okay?
[01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:35.439]  This is not unique to Democrats.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.721]  There is a game of money.
[01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:39.543]  When people talk about uniparty,
[01:03:40.811 --> 01:03:44.194]  We are strangled by the money reality in our politics.
[01:03:44.234 --> 01:03:46.455]  Those suites start at 500 grand.
[01:03:47.476 --> 01:03:49.618]  You think there's like a teacher group up in there?
[01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:54.541]  You think it's like the Cub Scouts of Columbia County, South Carolina, that's up in those boxes?
[01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:57.767]  Some of them are lobbies and good things.
[01:03:58.227 --> 01:03:59.768]  The media boxes, you think they're free?
[01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:01.788]  Why do you think I'm on the floor?
[01:04:02.669 --> 01:04:04.789]  NewsNation is not a broke company.
[01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:06.610]  Nexstar is a massive organization.
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.011]  We are corporate media.
[01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.611]  We don't have one of those boxes, because that's the game.
[01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:12.992]  You pay to play.
[01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:17.114]  Those boxes are filled with the same people that they say they're going to regulate.
[01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:24.412]  They are literally looking down on the faithful and being told, yeah, yeah, we're going to break down on them.
[01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:26.132]  We're going to make them pay their share.
[01:04:26.513 --> 01:04:30.754]  They paid 500, 700, a million, a million and a half to have those seats.
[01:04:31.094 --> 01:04:34.095]  They get hotel suites that are probably gifted to the party.
[01:04:34.295 --> 01:04:36.395]  And the same thing is true with the Republican side.
[01:04:36.996 --> 01:04:38.036]  And they're going to take them down?
[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:40.130]  They're going to change how it is.
[01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:44.952]  They are looking down from on high at the people who make the difference in their communities.
[01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:46.853]  And that is the reality of politics.
[01:04:47.373 --> 01:04:49.734]  And I had my producer walk around and show you those suites.
[01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:51.154]  None of that are all the same.
[01:04:51.294 --> 01:04:52.035]  They're not all the same.
[01:04:52.275 --> 01:04:58.617]  But the reality is, but the reality is, in 2000, they spent $300 million on presidential campaigns.
[01:04:59.597 --> 01:05:01.238]  24 years later, you know what they're expected to spend?
[01:05:01.258 --> 01:05:01.678]  $10 billion.
[01:05:04.679 --> 01:05:07.202]  Do you know how much money Harris has raised in the last couple of weeks?
[01:05:07.602 --> 01:05:09.504]  Hundreds of millions, and that's success!
[01:05:10.485 --> 01:05:12.367]  A lot of it's small donor, a lot of it isn't.
[01:05:12.927 --> 01:05:16.671]  The most dangerous money in politics is now legal money because it's Citizens United.
[01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:18.252]  You've gotta know this!
[01:05:18.893 --> 01:05:21.616]  The idea that they can fight against it is almost laughable!
[01:05:22.236 --> 01:05:23.958]  It's almost laughable, so look!
[01:05:24.992 --> 01:05:28.637]  Look and listen when you are told these things, because I don't care what they promise you.
[01:05:28.677 --> 01:05:32.963]  Not here tonight, not at the RNC, not that Trump knows them, not that they don't own them.
[01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:37.029]  He did one of the biggest fundraisers I've ever heard of in my life out where I live.
[01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:38.811]  Millions of dollars at play.
[01:05:39.172 --> 01:05:40.494]  That's the reality of politics.
[01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:43.259]  America, we are lucky today.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.283]  We're lucky in a way perhaps difficult for us all to see.
[01:05:46.503 --> 01:05:49.007]  We're lucky because we're not in a civil war right now.
[01:05:49.207 --> 01:05:54.834]  There are no makeshift field hospitals in Virginia filled with wounded boys who haven't even shaved yet.
[01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:10.738]  Toward the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited a 200-acre field hospital in Virginia, personally attending to thousands of wounded men who had seen hard fighting.
[01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:17.402]  Some of the patients were missing limbs, some were blind, some were scrawny with disease, and many of them were dying.
[01:06:17.622 --> 01:06:21.885]  And some were so young that Lincoln openly shook with sobs.
[01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:27.548]  One of these soldiers recalled that President Lincoln, quote, had a kind word for all of us.
[01:06:27.828 --> 01:06:31.110]  His voice, said an onlooker, was subdued.
[01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.592]  His eyes were mild, but all-observing.
[01:06:33.852 --> 01:06:40.616]  The close grasp of his hand attested the sympathetic, great-heartedness of this great man.
[01:06:41.176 --> 01:06:42.397]  Another soldier said that
[01:06:42.617 --> 01:06:49.121]  The President walked down the long aisle between the rows of cots and spoke to and shook hands with every man in the ward.
[01:06:49.341 --> 01:06:53.864]  It was that handshake that I've always considered the greatest honor that ever came to me.
[01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:59.467]  A doctor in the hospital said that Lincoln's visit was a green spot in the soldiers' anguished days.
[01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:07.332]  In 110, Lincoln encountered a Confederate, a member of the opposing army, and here's what the Confederate wrote about that encounter.
[01:07:07.612 --> 01:07:14.254]  Quote, he halted beside my bed and he held out his hand, looking at him in the face as he stood with extended hand.
[01:07:14.334 --> 01:07:17.675]  Mr. President, I said, do you know to whom you offer your hand?
[01:07:17.995 --> 01:07:19.235]  I do not, he replied.
[01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:25.237]  Well, I said, you offer it to a Confederate colonel who has fought you as hard as he could for four years.
[01:07:25.597 --> 01:07:29.638]  Well, says he, I hope a Confederate colonel will not refuse me his hand.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.261]  No, sir, I replied.
[01:07:31.421 --> 01:07:31.981]  I will not.
[01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:34.242]  And I clasped his hand in both of mine.
[01:07:34.923 --> 01:07:36.904]  America, we are lucky today.
[01:07:36.964 --> 01:07:39.926]  We're lucky in a way perhaps difficult for us all to see.
[01:07:40.126 --> 01:07:42.627]  We're lucky because we're not in a civil war right now.
[01:07:43.047 --> 01:07:47.710]  We are, as I have said, in what may be called a cold civil war.
[01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:49.651]  And we need to stop our fighting.
[01:07:50.052 --> 01:07:54.194]  We need to stop the relentless bickering, the judging, the hating.
[01:07:54.754 --> 01:07:59.137]  ...and extend to each other a new handshake of reconciliation.
[01:07:59.497 --> 01:08:07.241]  If that assassin's bullet on July 13th in Pennsylvania had found its mark, the cold Civil War that we're now immersed in could have gone hot.
[01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:12.564]  Not only President Trump, but maybe even our entire Republic had close brush with death.
[01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:16.726]  And a brush with death reminds us of what is precious.
[01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:21.554]  It reminds us of the preciousness of our loved ones and of life itself.
[01:08:21.934 --> 01:08:25.577]  And in this case, it recalls us to what is precious about our country.
[01:08:25.857 --> 01:08:28.159]  What is this experiment that we call America?
[01:08:28.639 --> 01:08:41.990]  For all of its dark chapters, the genocide of Native Americans, Jim Crow, slavery, imperialism abroad, and so on, America has also pursued its originating ideal of liberty and justice for all.
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:47.277]  That ideal is written into our nation's constitution and into our DNA.
[01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:51.422]  Our ancestors did not come to this country merely to survive.
[01:08:51.563 --> 01:08:55.588]  They came to America, the very archetype of a great nation.
[01:08:55.748 --> 01:08:58.472]  The best republics will be virtuous, John Adams said.
[01:08:58.972 --> 01:09:03.937]  And elsewhere Adams wrote that public virtue is the only foundation of republics.
[01:09:04.077 --> 01:09:09.522]  There must be a positive passion for public good established in the minds of the people.
[01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:14.126]  Or there can be no republican government, nor any real liberty, he wrote.
[01:09:14.326 --> 01:09:17.969]  A generation later, Ralph Waldo Emerson, our great philosopher, said,
[01:09:18.129 --> 01:09:21.991]  The power of love as the basis of a state has never been tried.
[01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:25.652]  There is no way to enforce such virtues.
[01:09:25.992 --> 01:09:31.535]  Our founding documents, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence can inspire civic virtue.
[01:09:31.555 --> 01:09:34.716]  But in the end, it's really up to us to choose it.
[01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:39.718]  Again and again, we must realign ourselves with the founding spirit of our nation.
[01:09:40.018 --> 01:09:41.859]  Now, in particular, is such a time.
[01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:45.300]  Are we willing to extend a hand across the divide?
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:50.561]  Are we ready to renew ourselves as one nation, one nation indivisible?
[01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:52.582]  I believe that we are.
[01:09:52.742 --> 01:09:57.163]  I believe that process, the process of reunion of our nation has already begun.
[01:09:57.183 --> 01:09:59.604]  That's what my presidential campaign is about.
[01:09:59.884 --> 01:10:08.926]  The goals of ending wars, reversing chronic disease, epidemics, restoring the middle class, getting corruption out of Washington and so forth are important.
[01:10:09.326 --> 01:10:11.507]  But they're not the deepest core of why I'm here.
[01:10:11.787 --> 01:10:15.249]  Because a nation divided cannot accomplish any of these things.
[01:10:15.589 --> 01:10:21.832]  I'm here to bring unity to our country with the best of my ability as I serve all of these other goals.
[01:10:22.532 --> 01:10:25.353]  And that's what I'm going to continue to do with your help.
[01:10:27.254 --> 01:10:30.476]  Now, as Kamala is coming up to speak this evening,
[01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:45.197]  We've seen a lot of reports from the left, influencers, regular voters, and pundits, mainstream mega pundits, as well as the politicians and former leaders like the Obamas and things of that nature, arguing against toxic masculinity.
[01:10:45.237 --> 01:10:49.980]  This is an argument that they've been making for a long time, despite the fact that they can't define what a man is or what a woman is.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.361]  You know, this is true.
[01:10:51.401 --> 01:10:52.141]  They can't even define that.
[01:10:52.181 --> 01:11:09.655]  But they argue against toxic masculinity, and they've been using rhetoric suggesting that the right-wing men, you know, with testosterone and gun-toting and fit and strong and masculine and attracted to beautiful women instead of obese women or trans women.
[01:11:10.626 --> 01:11:22.859]  They've argued that the reason these people on the right, these patriots on the right, aren't voting for Kamala Harris has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with the fact that they're simply misogynistic.
[01:11:23.659 --> 01:11:27.944]  Simply to do with the fact that these men would never elect a woman to office.
[01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:30.446]  So I created this little montage.
[01:11:31.027 --> 01:11:34.808]  Out of coverage of this today on the war room at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:11:34.828 --> 01:11:35.369]  This is clip number 12.
[01:11:36.029 --> 01:11:39.030]  I want to run this because this is designed to be the perfect response.
[01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:50.834]  The perfect clip for you, the audience to send to anyone who ever says this, any relativity friend, any social media person you see who says that toxic men won't vote for Kamala because she's a woman.
[01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:54.395]  So if she loses the election, it's because of toxic masculinity.
[01:11:54.715 --> 01:11:56.356]  This is the correct response to that.
[01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:56.816]  Please run it.
[01:11:58.041 --> 01:12:03.425]  I just know very few people refusing to vote for Kamala because she's a woman.
[01:12:03.925 --> 01:12:14.072]  The people I know who are refusing to vote for Kamala are refusing to do so because she was the border czar and catalyzed the invasion of our country by people who hate us and refuse to assimilate.
[01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:22.198]  They're not voting for her because she started her career on her knees and worked her way up appointment after appointment.
[01:12:23.359 --> 01:12:27.542]  She leveraged her way through diversity, equity, and inclusion into a vice president seat.
[01:12:28.283 --> 01:12:49.991]  And then she catalyzed and coordinated and conspired with Nancy Pelosi to establish a coup against the sitting president of her very own administration to ensure that he was forced by blackmail under threat of 25th Amendment exercise to leave the race prematurely so that she could be installed as the presidential candidate despite the fact that nobody in her party voted for her in the primary.
[01:12:50.031 --> 01:12:52.311]  They voted for Joe Biden, right?
[01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:54.732]  And I'm no Joe Biden fan, but this was absolutely stolen from him.
[01:12:54.752 --> 01:12:56.713]  This was a DNC coup.
[01:12:57.671 --> 01:13:00.180]  It was everything they said that January 6th was.
[01:13:01.055 --> 01:13:15.963]  They're not voting for Kamala Harris because, not because she's a woman, but because she advocates for equity instead of equality, where she wants an equal outcome, where everyone is equally impoverished instead of unequally prosperous.
[01:13:16.644 --> 01:13:21.046]  The men I know who aren't voting for Kamala Harris aren't making the decision not to vote for her because she's a woman.
[01:13:21.346 --> 01:13:29.091]  They're making the decision not to vote for her because she advocates explicitly for depopulation, pretends to be a maternal figure, though she has no children of her own.
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:38.777]  It supports policies that result in the burning down of cities, the bailing out of criminals, and the sterilization of our children before they've reached puberty.
[01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:44.602]  I don't know any men who aren't voting for Kamala Harris because she's a woman.
[01:13:44.642 --> 01:13:51.567]  I know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she has a Maoist on the ticket and her father was a Marxist.
[01:13:51.608 --> 01:13:55.150]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman.
[01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:59.294]  Instead, they're refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because they know that she's going to be a warmonger.
[01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:02.095]  You know, she's going to endlessly fund Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:14:02.335 --> 01:14:06.556]  She's going to endlessly fund both sides of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
[01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:12.797]  She's going to endlessly provoke China to China's benefit so they can justify an annexation of Taiwan.
[01:14:12.837 --> 01:14:14.478]  She is going to result in World War III.
[01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:28.460]  Men are not voting for Kamala Harris because they're afraid of having to fight in World War III on behalf of these people that we see at the DNC who have purple hair and are morbidly obese and very weak and insentimental and empathic, they suggest.
[01:14:29.778 --> 01:14:32.839]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman.
[01:14:33.119 --> 01:14:45.925]  I know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she advocates the genocide of unborn children to the tune of millions, specifically in minority communities, which Planned Parenthood was specifically designed to target as part of a eugenics program from the government of the United States of America.
[01:14:46.664 --> 01:14:57.370]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman, but I know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because things were so much better in 2019 than they are in 2024.
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:07.175]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman, but I do know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because everything is at least 40% more expensive.
[01:15:07.395 --> 01:15:08.316]  They can't afford a home.
[01:15:10.537 --> 01:15:36.128]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman, but I do know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because BlackRock is seizing up all of the private property homes in this country so they can have a total control monopoly over housing itself and then jack up the prices to justify government coming in and helping with those prices, which is increased government expansion.
[01:15:36.148 --> 01:15:36.848]  I don't know any men
[01:15:37.148 --> 01:15:49.972]  ...who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman, but I do know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she advocates for price-fixing groceries, which would lead to a massive shortage and starvation in this country, much like Mao during the Great Leap Forward led to starvation.
[01:15:50.272 --> 01:16:04.097]  I don't know any men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman, but I do know men who are refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she and her party advocate for the taxation of unrealized gains.
[01:16:05.396 --> 01:16:17.203]  Which would result in the massive sell-off of stocks every year when the multi-millionaire class they claim to be targeting exclusively has to sell their assets in order to pay that unrealized capital tax.
[01:16:18.743 --> 01:16:19.624]  Capital gains tax.
[01:16:20.584 --> 01:16:22.626]  And that massive sell-off would create slippage.
[01:16:23.026 --> 01:16:33.512]  And slippage would be the drastic reduction in the value of the stock market which would disproportionately impact people who have saved for retirement their entire lives responsibly by putting into index 500s.
[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.512]  I think so.
[01:16:57.358 --> 01:16:59.960]  Nothing to say when it comes to questions about her accomplishments.
[01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:12.510]  She has to constantly defend the fact that she imprisoned hundreds of people for petty marijuana charges, that she kept people in prison in California beyond the term of their sentence for the sake of slave labor.
[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:24.335]  That she allowed the invasion of this country, that she imprisoned single mothers who didn't realize that their kids were truant from school because they were working three jobs in California to try to make ends meet in a state that's totally unaffordable to live in.
[01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:24.896]  I live there.
[01:17:24.976 --> 01:17:26.977]  It is unaffordable to live in California.
[01:17:26.997 --> 01:17:28.417]  People say, oh, well, the weather is beautiful.
[01:17:28.697 --> 01:17:29.258]  That's nice.
[01:17:29.318 --> 01:17:36.441]  But if you have to spend 20 hours in the office, as I did, in order to afford to live there, you don't really get to experience or appreciate the weather, do you?
[01:17:37.395 --> 01:17:41.578]  No, I don't know any men refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a woman.
[01:17:41.998 --> 01:17:48.442]  I know men refusing to vote for Kamala Harris because she can't even define what a woman is.
[01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:50.084]  All right, folks.
[01:17:50.564 --> 01:17:51.124]  There you have it.
[01:17:51.164 --> 01:17:53.246]  The DNC is ensuing right before our eyes.
[01:17:53.566 --> 01:17:56.928]  Last I checked, we were hearing remarks from comedian D.L.
[01:17:57.028 --> 01:17:58.749]  Hughley, or Hughley, whatever his name is.
[01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:06.034]  And coming up very soon is going to be a conversation on gun violence with Georgia Rep.
[01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:06.875]  Lucy McBeth.
[01:18:07.655 --> 01:18:11.457]  Right now it looks like we're seeing remarks from Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.
[01:18:11.517 --> 01:18:13.278]  Let's go ahead and see what he has to say.
[01:18:13.318 --> 01:18:14.058]  But that didn't happen.
[01:18:14.098 --> 01:18:16.740]  We laid down our riot gear and we embraced the community
[01:18:36.397 --> 01:18:39.198]  And instead of hate, we chose hope.
[01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:48.403]  On January 6th, the opposite occurred.
[01:18:49.403 --> 01:18:56.446]  That day was paved with division, deceit, and denigration.
[01:18:57.547 --> 01:18:59.788]  Police officers were attacked that day.
[01:19:02.635 --> 01:19:09.298]  Kamala Harris bailed out the people attacking police during the George Floyd riots so they could continue to perpetuate the crime.
[01:19:11.358 --> 01:19:12.099]  What is he thinking?
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:21.202]  I went to Target right before this and got a whole bottle of crude to put on my head.
[01:19:23.922 --> 01:19:25.543]  They always look like they've been electrocuted.
[01:19:25.563 --> 01:19:26.243]  She did nothing.
[01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:57.148]  Not even Kareem Jean-Pierre can name a single accomplishment of Kamala Harris as Vice President other than the fact that she is Kamala Harris and is the Vice President.
[01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:00.111]  No she won't.
[01:20:00.691 --> 01:20:01.572]  No she won't.
[01:20:06.578 --> 01:20:12.283]  Because our country needs a leader who will go toe-to-toe with drug cartels and bullies.
[01:20:12.303 --> 01:20:12.883]  No, she won't.
[01:20:13.344 --> 01:20:14.705]  She's got the border wide open.
[01:20:15.205 --> 01:20:16.286]  She is the bully.
[01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:20.830]  She is the one that prosecuted innocent people and kept them in prison beyond their term.
[01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:22.371]  This is a bad cop.
[01:20:22.792 --> 01:20:25.394]  I mean, generally speaking, I support law enforcement.
[01:20:25.414 --> 01:20:26.635]  Most of the cops I know are very good men.
[01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:27.596]  This is a bad cop.
[01:20:28.076 --> 01:20:33.781]  We were able to turn a protest into a peaceful movement by walking together.
[01:20:35.077 --> 01:20:38.719]  One city, one community, and one country.
[01:20:42.982 --> 01:20:45.003]  America, let's walk.
[01:20:45.824 --> 01:20:46.484]  Let's walk.
[01:20:46.924 --> 01:20:54.689]  Let's walk together and let's elect Kamala Harris and turn hate into hope yet again.
[01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.630]  Thank you.
[01:21:05.963 --> 01:21:11.245]  We were contemplating adopting, and then out of nowhere, I got pregnant.
[01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:14.205]  Chorda was so much fun as a child.
[01:21:15.706 --> 01:21:18.227]  By the way, folks, we have Rex Jones here with us.
[01:21:18.647 --> 01:21:23.528]  They've been really talking a lot about this IVF thing, this in vitro fertilization thing, and I'd be interested to hear what you have to think about this.
[01:21:23.548 --> 01:21:29.190]  I know that you've recently kind of really embraced your new faith.
[01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:31.190]  What's the word?
[01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:34.231]  Not baptized into the Orthodox Church, but
[01:21:34.517 --> 01:21:35.117]  Catechized.
[01:21:36.378 --> 01:21:37.779]  I'm bad at pronouncing things.
[01:21:37.839 --> 01:21:39.140]  Catechumen in the Orthodox Church.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.241]  Yeah, so I want to ask you about this.
[01:21:41.622 --> 01:21:58.512]  They've been talking a lot about IVF because they're trying to make the case that this Roe v. Wade thing and Donald Trump not only want to ban abortions, but they also want to ban the process of IVF in vitro fertilization for people who are having a hard time having a family.
[01:21:58.932 --> 01:22:01.654]  My personal position as of now, and maybe it'll change after this conversation.
[01:22:01.674 --> 01:22:02.575]  I'm subject to change.
[01:22:03.435 --> 01:22:15.325]  I'm a pro-humanity person, I'm a team humanity person, and I'm very concerned about depopulation, so I'm very reluctant to advocate for any policy that keeps people from being able to have kids if they are having fertility issues.
[01:22:16.586 --> 01:22:21.190]  That being said, I looked it up today, there's no state where IVF is illegal altogether.
[01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:23.032]  There's different regulations and rules around it.
[01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:30.856]  I think they're first making an error by saying that people who want kids aren't going to be able to have kids because of this abortion law.
[01:22:30.936 --> 01:22:36.700]  And second of all, you know, as someone on the right, as of now, I am pro IVF.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.300]  What are your thoughts?
[01:22:37.694 --> 01:22:42.358]  Well, we enter into a very difficult and nuanced topic, like, right off the block as I- Yeah.
[01:22:42.498 --> 01:22:43.119]  It's InfoWars.
[01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:44.680]  Yeah, of course.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.762]  I gotta say, I have to do more research.
[01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:47.142]  Yeah.
[01:22:47.242 --> 01:22:49.104]  I kinda probably have a more nuanced view of it.
[01:22:49.124 --> 01:22:49.304]  Yeah.
[01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:52.066]  Like you, like depopulation, fertility issues.
[01:22:52.106 --> 01:22:53.467]  I mean, infertility sucks for people.
[01:22:53.487 --> 01:22:53.627]  Right.
[01:22:53.647 --> 01:22:55.129]  Like, it's a very, very big problem.
[01:22:55.889 --> 01:22:57.971]  And that's not something you want anyone to go through.
[01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:59.933]  But also, freezing somebody?
[01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:00.733]  Yes.
[01:23:00.853 --> 01:23:04.435]  And like, well, that's a concern because what they have to do is I understand it for IVF.
[01:23:04.475 --> 01:23:11.999]  My brother actually, and his wife had to do IVF because, um, for some health reasons, actually, it wasn't even infertility reason.
[01:23:12.079 --> 01:23:12.880]  It was other health reasons.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.040]  And
[01:23:14.847 --> 01:23:20.591]  What they do is, as I understand, they fertilize a bunch of eggs, and they'll try to plant several of them at a time.
[01:23:20.611 --> 01:23:26.115]  That's why so many people who go through IVF actually have twins who aren't identical twins, because two of the eggs caught.
[01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:27.797]  So they might do two or three eggs at a time.
[01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:31.299]  Two of them they know are going to die, and one of them might catch.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:36.163]  And then you freeze the rest, and people never go back and actually use the ones that are frozen sometimes.
[01:23:36.223 --> 01:23:38.425]  And so there is a fertilized egg.
[01:23:39.165 --> 01:23:59.265]  It's not the same as abortion because you're not intentionally killing an unborn child, but unborn children do kind of unintentionally die as a result of this process because not all of the eggs can catch when you do that.
[01:24:00.563 --> 01:24:06.686]  Yeah, I'm just gonna always say less than, uh, I'll always say, eh, you know.
[01:24:07.706 --> 01:24:08.707]  It's a nuanced topic.
[01:24:08.727 --> 01:24:10.628]  I'm kind of battling in my head here.
[01:24:10.848 --> 01:24:12.269]  I can't really make up my mind.
[01:24:12.429 --> 01:24:13.549]  I really need to do more research.
[01:24:13.609 --> 01:24:15.190]  It's kind of a blind spot for me, I would say.
[01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:16.331]  Yeah, probably for me too.
[01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:18.632]  With abortion, I'm just flat out pro-life.
[01:24:18.732 --> 01:24:19.912]  Like, I can't stand.
[01:24:20.032 --> 01:24:22.654]  It seems different when you have people walking into a mobile murderer.
[01:24:22.674 --> 01:24:22.994]  Yeah.
[01:24:23.354 --> 01:24:32.630]  You know, Mobile, outside of the DNC, and there's reports that like two dozen people the other day were given abortion pills right outside the DNC while they're advocating for IVF on the inside.
[01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:37.158]  That seems different to me than people who are trying to have kids just having eggs that unfortunately don't catch.
[01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:40.123]  Yeah, well, like, these things aren't to be celebrated.
[01:24:40.163 --> 01:24:41.284]  These things aren't fun.
[01:24:41.384 --> 01:24:45.328]  These things are what the Democrats used to call safe, legal, and rare, what they would talk about.
[01:24:45.448 --> 01:24:51.834]  Oh, we need this little exception here for this very rare edge case, but they say it's a flawed argument.
[01:24:51.874 --> 01:24:54.236]  They say it's a trope, but the slippery slope is real.
[01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:58.359]  100%.
[01:24:55.497 --> 01:24:58.359]  And we've just gone down that road and gone down that road and gone down that road.
[01:24:58.419 --> 01:24:59.159]  Wouldn't you agree?
[01:24:59.199 --> 01:24:59.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.861]  Just everything is too extreme, basically.
[01:25:01.901 --> 01:25:03.502]  Everything's kind of unregulated.
[01:25:03.962 --> 01:25:10.287]  If you look at a bus, like I was driving today in Austin, Texas, and I saw a bus just was plastered with gambling ads.
[01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:11.668]  Almost certainly an empty bus, too.
[01:25:12.068 --> 01:25:13.308]  Yeah, pretty much, probably.
[01:25:13.348 --> 01:25:15.149]  It was early in the morning, so who knows?
[01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:17.949]  Maybe there could have been a bunch of hobos, like, catching a ride.
[01:25:17.969 --> 01:25:20.510]  Like, alright, we gave you a bus, but now you're encouraging these people to gamble?
[01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:22.751]  But yeah, I mean, like, people are being encouraged to gamble.
[01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:26.692]  They're being encouraged to do illicit drugs in the media.
[01:25:26.752 --> 01:25:29.672]  It's just all a giant snafu at the end of the day.
[01:25:29.992 --> 01:25:36.494]  And if you look at an issue like IVF, you can say, well, there's more of a genuine benefit to it.
[01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:40.785]  And it comes at far less of a cost than something like an abortion.
[01:25:41.186 --> 01:25:41.406]  Yeah.
[01:25:41.426 --> 01:25:41.866]  Per se.
[01:25:41.906 --> 01:25:42.927]  I don't think they're equivalent.
[01:25:42.967 --> 01:25:45.669]  I think it's a much more nuanced thing, but I don't know the theology.
[01:25:45.689 --> 01:25:46.970]  I don't know the political issue.
[01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:48.011]  I don't know the actual issue.
[01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:49.152]  I'll have to get back to you on that.
[01:25:49.412 --> 01:25:49.612]  Sure.
[01:25:50.573 --> 01:25:54.796]  Well, you're one of the smartest guys that I know, especially around... I'm smart!
[01:25:55.176 --> 01:25:57.058]  Especially around supplements and things of that nature.
[01:25:57.458 --> 01:26:00.500]  I didn't even know there were different types of caffeine until I talked to Rex Jones.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.081]  And you can break it down.
[01:26:02.221 --> 01:26:04.923]  I know that you work with Dr. Jones Naturals, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:26:04.963 --> 01:26:05.564]  Please support them.
[01:26:05.584 --> 01:26:06.805]  They're one of our important sponsors.
[01:26:07.485 --> 01:26:12.967]  And you formulated things like the Shroom Force and other supplements that have amazing health benefits.
[01:26:13.487 --> 01:26:21.890]  Can we just talk, IVF aside, abortion aside, can we talk a little bit about what you think is behind the fertility crisis that seems to be happening all over the world?
[01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:24.611]  Well, the food is poison.
[01:26:25.031 --> 01:26:26.712]  Yeah, like all the food is poison.
[01:26:26.732 --> 01:26:31.495]  All the foods got glyphosate in and everything that's got grain in it is just completely toxic to you.
[01:26:31.835 --> 01:26:32.875]  But we all love to eat it.
[01:26:32.935 --> 01:26:34.196]  I mean, I got donuts the other day.
[01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:35.777]  We're all poisoning ourselves.
[01:26:35.797 --> 01:26:42.781]  We're all wearing like the, you know, like they say the mesh pants and stuff are bad, like the microplastics can get your balls through your skin.
[01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:45.642]  I was watching the Morning Journal and they were talking about that.
[01:26:46.002 --> 01:26:48.584]  So, I mean it's just a variety of factors.
[01:26:48.684 --> 01:26:53.386]  I don't think it's like, men in America have gotten soft and it's just fallen off a cliff.
[01:26:53.446 --> 01:26:54.626]  I don't think that's the reason.
[01:26:54.666 --> 01:26:55.307]  That's kind of stupid.
[01:26:55.367 --> 01:26:59.429]  Some variables seem to have kicked in though after World War II and maybe it's the case.
[01:27:00.069 --> 01:27:00.569]  We're good to go.
[01:27:24.218 --> 01:27:31.741]  Happened and correlation isn't causation, but it's just weird to see the feminization of men juxtaposed, correlated to the infertility of men increasing.
[01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:33.681]  It seems like there's some hormonal shit going on.
[01:27:33.741 --> 01:27:40.464]  I think it has more to do with the masculinization, you know, of just like women and then just like the feminization of men.
[01:27:40.504 --> 01:27:42.344]  Like we're not even told to really be equals.
[01:27:42.744 --> 01:27:49.967]  We're kind of just told to exist in this weird paradigm with each other that the government, the nanny state has set up, and that's not how people are supposed to coexist, folks.
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:56.051]  You're not supposed to be on Tinder, you're not supposed to be on Instagram, you're not supposed to be on all these things where you can see thousands of people.
[01:27:56.071 --> 01:27:56.851]  It just screws people up.
[01:27:56.891 --> 01:27:57.592]  I think it's the phone.
[01:27:58.212 --> 01:27:59.413]  I think it's the phone.
[01:27:59.453 --> 01:28:00.534]  But it started before the phone.
[01:28:00.554 --> 01:28:02.815]  Yeah, but I think people just aren't having kids.
[01:28:03.275 --> 01:28:07.458]  I mean, if you measured 120-year-olds, I bet all of them could get a girl pregnant.
[01:28:07.778 --> 01:28:08.439]  I guarantee it.
[01:28:08.699 --> 01:28:15.763]  Like, just in Austin, like, good, healthy, like, college sample size, like, kids like 18 and 21, they'd be able to get a girl pregnant.
[01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.024]  I don't see any fertility issue.
[01:28:17.364 --> 01:28:18.185]  Would they want to?
[01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:19.166]  Hell no!
[01:28:19.246 --> 01:28:19.786]  Sure, sure.
[01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:20.927]  Hell no they wouldn't want to.
[01:28:21.207 --> 01:28:21.367]  Yeah.
[01:28:21.387 --> 01:28:23.569]  It's just fascinating that this is happening.
[01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:30.634]  Apparently right now at the DNC there's a medley going on, a very masculine medley going on, about the importance of gun violence and gun reform.
[01:28:30.654 --> 01:28:32.816]  Let's tune into this for a little bit and see what we have to say.
[01:28:33.096 --> 01:28:35.398]  They strengthen our resolve.
[01:28:38.681 --> 01:28:43.645]  We will secure safer futures that we all deserve.
[01:28:44.744 --> 01:28:47.249]  It's interesting how they have these individual speakers, and then they have like a medley.
[01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:50.575]  And then an ad, and then a song, and then individual speakers, and then a medley.
[01:28:52.877 --> 01:28:54.819]  We will run for office!
[01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:59.662]  This is what happens when you have a bunch of drama school kids planning a show.
[01:28:59.883 --> 01:29:01.023]  And they're all drama school kids.
[01:29:01.124 --> 01:29:01.944]  It comes off like that.
[01:29:02.064 --> 01:29:02.745]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:02.945 --> 01:29:06.027]  The theater kids have gotten in control of the Democratic National Convention.
[01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:10.471]  And they all look like people from Star Trek, in my opinion.
[01:29:10.591 --> 01:29:12.212]  They're all wearing Star Trek.
[01:29:12.292 --> 01:29:13.313]  Very Schwabian.
[01:29:13.513 --> 01:29:15.955]  It's what Steven Seagal would wear in Star Trek.
[01:29:23.687 --> 01:29:35.380]  And we will elect leaders like Kamala Harris, who won't just empathize, but will act.
[01:29:38.784 --> 01:29:40.046]  Yeah, shades of Alex.
[01:29:50.435 --> 01:29:51.715]  You're a gentle soul, Chase.
[01:29:51.775 --> 01:29:52.496]  Everyone knows that.
[01:29:52.536 --> 01:29:53.096]  Just like me.
[01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:06.481]  Please welcome former Arizona Representative Gabby Giffords.
[01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.041]  Gabrielle Giffords.
[01:30:08.822 --> 01:30:09.302]  She again?
[01:30:09.522 --> 01:30:10.282]  What's her profile?
[01:30:10.542 --> 01:30:11.442]  She's former U.S.
[01:30:11.502 --> 01:30:12.823]  Representative from Arizona.
[01:30:14.747 --> 01:30:16.088]  So obviously Arizona very important.
[01:30:16.108 --> 01:30:21.131]  Looks like she walked out with Mark Kelly, who's not supposed to speak until after a performance from Pink.
[01:30:22.772 --> 01:30:24.493]  That guy's Vampire Central Castle.
[01:30:24.693 --> 01:30:30.156]  Oh yeah, he's a NASA astronaut that was one of the people on the shortlist to be the VP for Kamala.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.681]  He didn't want to work with the Space Cadet.
[01:30:47.064 --> 01:30:50.465]  Smells good to see genuine enthusiasm.
[01:30:50.565 --> 01:30:51.565]  Look at that broach.
[01:30:51.585 --> 01:30:56.227]  I think she has like a huge trunk full of them.
[01:30:56.527 --> 01:30:59.268]  She's like, which one should I wear tonight?
[01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:02.069]  She looks like that lady from Succession.
[01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:17.414]  Like the older lady who, like, works in the executive accountant position.
[01:31:17.434 --> 01:31:19.695]  Maybe that isn't Mark Kelly and he just looks like him.
[01:31:19.775 --> 01:31:22.417]  Pretty sure it is.
[01:31:22.437 --> 01:31:23.438]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:23.898]  They're married.
[01:31:23.918 --> 01:31:24.619]  I forgot.
[01:31:24.659 --> 01:31:26.300]  Just listen to the narcissism.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.801]  Everyone called me a rising star.
[01:31:28.922 --> 01:31:31.884]  Oh, that's right.
[01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.365]  She had a serious injury.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:35.901]  Terrible, terrible day.
[01:31:35.921 --> 01:31:36.401]  Years ago.
[01:31:37.181 --> 01:31:38.342]  She was shot in the head.
[01:31:38.422 --> 01:31:39.702]  Well, that's pretty good.
[01:31:39.742 --> 01:31:40.503]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:31:40.523 --> 01:31:44.904]  So it's an anti-gun thing, and that's why he's out there helping her because she has a little bit of a hard time.
[01:31:44.944 --> 01:31:45.505]  Okay, that makes sense.
[01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:49.266]  That's pretty solid political playwork from the Democrats.
[01:31:49.306 --> 01:31:49.526]  Yeah.
[01:31:49.687 --> 01:31:50.927]  Pretty damn good.
[01:31:51.067 --> 01:31:54.669]  They didn't think she was ever going to walk or speak again.
[01:31:54.789 --> 01:31:55.289]  She can do it.
[01:31:56.363 --> 01:32:02.809]  To ban guns, anything is possible.
[01:32:02.849 --> 01:32:04.211]  Good for her to be fair.
[01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:06.273]  Yeah, I'm not gonna make fun of her.
[01:32:06.373 --> 01:32:08.315]  I was very unaware of that.
[01:32:12.406 --> 01:32:13.706]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[01:32:14.347 --> 01:32:16.507]  Thank you for everything.
[01:32:16.627 --> 01:32:26.490]  This bothers me because you know that there's been a lot of viral conversation today around Gus Walz, Tim Walz's son, who was seen sort of inspirationally clapping and crying for his dad.
[01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:29.130]  Yeah, it was on my Apple News.
[01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:31.691]  And it came out that he's learning disabled and nonverbal.
[01:32:32.082 --> 01:32:32.602]  Well, yeah.
[01:32:32.743 --> 01:32:33.143]  Duh.
[01:32:33.283 --> 01:32:34.644]  I mean, do you look at the video?
[01:32:34.764 --> 01:32:35.765]  Yeah.
[01:32:35.985 --> 01:32:38.227]  I just thought he was eccentric because his dad's kind of like that, too.
[01:32:38.607 --> 01:32:41.129]  And so I felt bad because I made fun of him and then I realized he actually had a problem.
[01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.990]  I deleted some of those tweets.
[01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.651]  Yeah, no, he's just doing his thing.
[01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:44.212]  Yeah.
[01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:49.296]  But the thing is, like, they come after the right for making fun of or memeing these people.
[01:32:49.656 --> 01:32:52.999]  And it is wrong to meme and make fun of people that have an immutable problem.
[01:32:53.239 --> 01:32:53.879]  It's not their fault.
[01:32:53.919 --> 01:32:54.900]  They just have the problem.
[01:32:55.581 --> 01:32:57.342]  But at the same time, they're exploiting them for gain.
[01:32:57.362 --> 01:32:58.283]  That's exactly the point.
[01:32:58.803 --> 01:33:05.148]  Just as we were talking before, and once you informed me of what happened to her, we just kind of like took a step back.
[01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:06.269]  We took a step back there.
[01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:08.832]  They would never do that, and they haven't done that with Trump.
[01:33:09.602 --> 01:33:09.822]  Right.
[01:33:09.842 --> 01:33:10.562]  With the assassination.
[01:33:10.602 --> 01:33:10.802]  Right.
[01:33:10.863 --> 01:33:15.844]  Well, the thing is, though, they bring these people out as, like, the... This goes all the way back to Helen Keller, man.
[01:33:15.864 --> 01:33:17.265]  Helen Keller was championed.
[01:33:17.665 --> 01:33:18.685]  Oh, you're getting deep.
[01:33:19.045 --> 01:33:22.847]  Yes, they're exploiting... They're exploiting disabilities.
[01:33:22.967 --> 01:33:23.267]  That's 100% true.
[01:33:23.307 --> 01:33:23.507]  Right?
[01:33:23.567 --> 01:33:25.528]  So it's like, oh, how dare you make fun of this person?
[01:33:25.608 --> 01:33:26.328]  Look how touched he is.
[01:33:26.348 --> 01:33:27.008]  Y'all pull that up.
[01:33:27.348 --> 01:33:30.890]  By the way, I don't know if you can even find footage of Helen Keller being in parades for Marxism.
[01:33:31.730 --> 01:33:33.691]  But this is what the left has always done.
[01:33:33.711 --> 01:33:48.901]  They always take the most vulnerable in the community, and then they tout them and bring them out as if they're the party that is championing these vulnerable people, and then they criticize anybody who criticizes that as being insensitive, but what they're actually doing is exploiting the disability themselves.
[01:33:49.061 --> 01:33:57.946]  Well, Chase, I'm a Democrat, so I believe that Ann Sullivan totally didn't just say things for Helen Keller and lie about what Helen was telling her.
[01:33:58.186 --> 01:34:00.548]  So you think Helen Keller was actually deaf and blind?
[01:34:01.098 --> 01:34:02.420]  I think it was all a hoax.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:08.488]  I think she was crippled from birth and that she couldn't learn how to speak no matter what and that that lady used her to preach her past.
[01:34:08.508 --> 01:34:11.352]  Oh, so you think that she was deaf and blind and she was just used?
[01:34:11.492 --> 01:34:12.353]  Yes, I do.
[01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:12.994]  Right, right.
[01:34:13.034 --> 01:34:14.877]  I don't know how to say water because my hand was on a faucet.
[01:34:16.643 --> 01:34:19.165]  That's like the first page of the book, the Helen Keller autobiography.
[01:34:19.585 --> 01:34:28.352]  You know, one of the things that actually encourages me about Gen Z, I've got some nephews that are in that generation, and there were a lot of leftists that were complaining about this on TikTok and social media years ago.
[01:34:28.952 --> 01:34:39.841]  Teachers were really frustrated because when they would teach about Helen Keller in school, as all public schools do, and when I grew up, everybody just took it for granted when they learned about Helen Keller in public school, but when they would teach about it,
[01:34:40.481 --> 01:34:41.822]  They were getting pushback from the students.
[01:34:41.862 --> 01:34:52.089]  It's like it's actually a positive manifestation of the phone thing because I think Gen Z is aware that there's so much BS out there that they don't necessarily believe everything at face value.
[01:34:52.169 --> 01:35:10.181]  Obviously, many of them are falling for this trans stuff and there's problems, but there is a substantial portion of this generation that is aware that you cannot believe everything that you hear in a way that previous generations are not aware of that fact, intuitively speaking, because they've trusted the three channels that were on TV when they were growing up with the New York Times as the paper everybody read.
[01:35:10.921 --> 01:35:12.102]  And so there is some hope, right?
[01:35:12.402 --> 01:35:13.924]  You know what I'm jealous of?
[01:35:14.464 --> 01:35:18.567]  I'm jealous that I didn't get to go to a 7-Eleven in the 90s.
[01:35:20.068 --> 01:35:21.109]  That's what I'm jealous of.
[01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:23.251]  I'm jealous that I didn't get to live in that time.
[01:35:23.291 --> 01:35:24.051]  What year were you born?
[01:35:24.071 --> 01:35:24.051]  2002.
[01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.753]  Oh man, I went to a 7-Eleven in the 90s.
[01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:32.578]  I'm jealous I didn't get that last decade of somewhat peace even though everything was still being corrupted and collapsing.
[01:35:32.598 --> 01:35:39.823]  I'm so glad that people like you and like my dad got to see life before all this because I was born after 9-Eleven.
[01:35:40.023 --> 01:35:46.246]  My buddies and I, when we were like nine years old, 1999, we would ride our bike to the Freedom gas station, which was about, I don't know, two miles from my house.
[01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:52.510]  And we'd go in there and buy candy and hang out and kind of taunt the guy that worked behind the counter because he was a curmudgeon.
[01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:53.631]  You know, there's nothing wrong with him.
[01:35:53.651 --> 01:35:54.391]  He was just angry.
[01:35:54.431 --> 01:35:55.972]  So we'd always kind of go in and try to provoke him.
[01:35:55.992 --> 01:35:58.413]  Then he'd say stuff like, why don't you mosey on out of here?
[01:35:58.433 --> 01:35:58.954]  And we'd laugh.
[01:35:59.034 --> 01:35:59.614]  Mosey!
[01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.035]  You know?
[01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:04.016]  And yeah, I distinctly remember that kind of old school thing.
[01:36:04.056 --> 01:36:04.977]  But now Pink is performing.
[01:36:04.997 --> 01:36:05.777]  Let's get a taste of this.
[01:36:10.797 --> 01:36:12.218]  Again, she looks like she's been electrocuted.
[01:36:12.238 --> 01:36:14.820]  It's a motif.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.902]  Like, they got Hollywood, dude.
[01:36:16.922 --> 01:36:17.442]  They got it.
[01:36:17.462 --> 01:36:18.383]  They got the music industry.
[01:36:18.463 --> 01:36:19.604]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:36:20.945 --> 01:36:25.729]  She looks like an Olympian boxer.
[01:36:29.332 --> 01:36:39.780]  And she's been notoriously vigilant and militant online about, you know, if you're a fan of mine and you're a Trump supporter, you might as well stay home, don't come to the show, that kind of stuff.
[01:36:46.215 --> 01:36:51.142]  Again, us, we, all language we're using, very collectivist.
[01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:53.385]  You will join the Hyde Mine now.
[01:36:53.886 --> 01:36:55.388]  It is time to join now.
[01:36:55.748 --> 01:36:59.794]  Like, it's just... I mean, imagine paying for box seats in Kansas City.
[01:36:59.834 --> 01:37:01.857]  Yeah, two and a half million dollars, some of them.
[01:37:02.398 --> 01:37:11.410]  There's a mom up there somewhere raving out, euphoric about her NBC time finally being validated at some kind of celebration.
[01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:14.154]  Her cable TV time finally being validated.
[01:37:14.234 --> 01:37:15.516]  Let me ask you this, Rex.
[01:37:15.576 --> 01:37:17.138]  Are you able to separate the art from the artist?
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.300]  Because I listen to a lot of music.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.641]  I studied audio engineering, thought I was going to be in the music business.
[01:37:23.361 --> 01:37:27.782]  And some of the best music is made by the most evil commie stuff.
[01:37:27.802 --> 01:37:28.502]  Grimes is a good example.
[01:37:28.522 --> 01:37:31.042]  I don't think she's evil, but she's definitely a leftist.
[01:37:31.662 --> 01:37:37.363]  In terms of some of her philosophies, she's been photographed reading the Communist Manifesto in a celebratory way, not necessarily an academic way.
[01:37:37.823 --> 01:37:39.724]  But she made the best pop record I've ever heard.
[01:37:40.004 --> 01:37:40.624]  Artangel, right?
[01:37:40.664 --> 01:37:46.005]  So will you boycott artists that are too leftist, or will you enjoy a Robert De Niro movie?
[01:37:47.364 --> 01:37:49.205]  I will enjoy a Robert De Niro movie.
[01:37:49.785 --> 01:37:54.726]  I will choose to do that because, you know, he might get nuked tomorrow, so I might as well watch the movie, right?
[01:37:54.806 --> 01:38:06.429]  I mean, there's a certain level to it, there's a certain level to it, where you just have to look at things and go, is this money that I'm paying to enjoy this service directly contributing to, like, pure evil?
[01:38:06.869 --> 01:38:07.130]  Right.
[01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:14.291]  And when you do that assessment, you look at everything you're doing, you look at your phone, you look at your car, you look at everything, and everything's just pure evil, you know?
[01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:15.792]  Like, it's got cameras in it.
[01:38:15.852 --> 01:38:16.032]  Right.
[01:38:16.152 --> 01:38:17.453]  I think you can separate the art from the artist 100%.
[01:38:42.372 --> 01:38:42.912]  I think so too.
[01:38:43.433 --> 01:38:44.273]  I like Michael Jackson.
[01:38:44.453 --> 01:38:45.234]  I think Michael Jackson.
[01:38:45.274 --> 01:38:46.275]  I actually think he's innocent.
[01:38:46.815 --> 01:38:47.235]  Interesting.
[01:38:47.275 --> 01:38:48.196]  We'll have to have a debate.
[01:38:48.236 --> 01:38:49.337]  I'll just tell you right now why.
[01:38:49.357 --> 01:38:57.662]  Because the same guy that made that documentary about Michael Jackson on HBO made the Truth vs. Alex Jones documentary.
[01:38:58.763 --> 01:39:03.808]  So, I believed the Michael Jackson stuff until I saw the Truth vs... And then what did he make up about Michael Jackson?
[01:39:03.828 --> 01:39:09.413]  So I started listening to Thriller again with another level of enthusiasm after I realized how full... Interesting.
[01:39:09.433 --> 01:39:11.895]  Well, I like Michael Jackson, but I don't know.
[01:39:12.816 --> 01:39:13.256]  Interesting.
[01:39:13.276 --> 01:39:16.859]  I'll have to research IVF and Michael Jackson after this show.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.341]  Very interesting topic.
[01:39:18.401 --> 01:39:23.886]  I'll write a report on it, like school, and I'll bring it in, and I'll have Alex grade it, and I'll go, B- at best.
[01:39:24.653 --> 01:39:26.615]  And then I'll bring it in to Chase, and hopefully he gives me a better grade.
[01:39:26.635 --> 01:39:27.155]  What'd he do to that?
[01:39:27.175 --> 01:39:28.496]  Did Alex grade your papers when you were growing up?
[01:39:28.536 --> 01:39:28.676]  No.
[01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:33.500]  It sounds like something you would say, though, no matter how good the paper was.
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.601]  No, that never happened.
[01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:36.763]  I don't think I ever went down.
[01:39:36.823 --> 01:39:38.004]  I don't think I ever went on.
[01:39:38.604 --> 01:39:39.545]  Did you go to public school?
[01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:39.885]  No.
[01:39:40.385 --> 01:39:40.526]  No?
[01:39:40.806 --> 01:39:40.946]  No.
[01:39:41.266 --> 01:39:42.968]  We're not going to discuss my prior life.
[01:39:43.308 --> 01:39:44.108]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:39:44.849 --> 01:39:45.510]  Sorry I brought it up.
[01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:48.272]  We are going to discuss... Is Mark Kelly up in the DNC?
[01:39:52.233 --> 01:39:52.813]  I'm not sure if he's up.
[01:39:52.833 --> 01:39:54.354]  He's supposed to speak next after Pink's performance.
[01:39:54.374 --> 01:39:55.795]  They still got the performance going.
[01:39:55.815 --> 01:39:57.256]  You know, they got the music playing.
[01:39:57.276 --> 01:40:00.838]  They got the... Okay, let's bring him up.
[01:40:00.858 --> 01:40:01.218]  You're fine.
[01:40:01.258 --> 01:40:04.380]  I just don't want to, like, dox myself on accident.
[01:40:10.863 --> 01:40:16.646]  So... President Obama had to follow Michelle.
[01:40:18.087 --> 01:40:19.948]  I had to follow Gabby and Pink.
[01:40:24.929 --> 01:40:28.271]  Gabby amazes me every single day.
[01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:38.619]  She was able to walk out and address you tonight because she's a fighter.
[01:40:42.742 --> 01:40:50.127]  And thanks to a team of doctors, nurses, and especially her speech therapist.
[01:40:55.029 --> 01:40:56.189]  We all need a team.
[01:40:57.750 --> 01:41:00.591]  I've flown into space four times.
[01:41:03.773 --> 01:41:08.935]  I've flown into combat nearly 40 times.
[01:41:11.376 --> 01:41:12.857]  That's 40 times more than Tim Walz.
[01:41:12.877 --> 01:41:15.878]  Not once did I do that by myself.
[01:41:17.158 --> 01:41:17.839]  Not with Tim Walz though.
[01:41:17.879 --> 01:41:20.880]  It took a team to accomplish a mission.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:22.981]  It always does.
[01:41:24.781 --> 01:41:27.482]  I flew in the Navy during the first Gulf War.
[01:41:29.202 --> 01:41:37.424]  America rallied our allies to kick out a tyrant who invaded a neighbor.
[01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:46.267]  Today, Vladimir Putin is testing whether we're still that strong.
[01:41:46.327 --> 01:41:46.607]  Iran.
[01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:47.227]  North Korea.
[01:41:51.846 --> 01:41:55.248]  And especially China, watch closely.
[01:41:57.089 --> 01:41:58.230]  What's Trump's answer?
[01:41:59.591 --> 01:42:07.176]  He invited Russia to do, and these are his words, not mine, whatever the hell they want.
[01:42:12.279 --> 01:42:19.364]  Vice President Harris has always championed America's support for NATO, for Ukraine,
[01:42:23.536 --> 01:42:25.441]  And for the Ukrainian people!
[01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:35.240]  On the Senate Intelligence Committee, she investigated Russian interference in our election.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.541]  She defends free, fair elections everywhere.
[01:42:40.581 --> 01:42:43.762]  World War III is going to be really expensive for some and very lucrative for others.
[01:42:43.782 --> 01:42:46.462]  You already know how Trump feels about those.
[01:42:46.522 --> 01:42:47.923]  How about we put you in a shack?
[01:42:48.403 --> 01:42:52.243]  Wouldn't you like to live in a shack with a nice electric car?
[01:42:52.363 --> 01:42:53.744]  Wouldn't you want to live in the shack?
[01:42:53.824 --> 01:42:54.904]  He was too busy.
[01:42:55.549 --> 01:42:57.356]  Maybe a healthcare, Canadian healthcare.
[01:42:57.376 --> 01:42:58.319]  Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:43:03.024 --> 01:43:03.905]  You know who he looks like?
[01:43:04.005 --> 01:43:06.186]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:06.626]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:06.666 --> 01:43:08.007]  It's just four years.
[01:43:08.027 --> 01:43:09.568]  Why didn't he become the dictator?
[01:43:10.268 --> 01:43:10.889]  It didn't happen.
[01:43:11.349 --> 01:43:12.130]  Yeah.
[01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:14.171]  If he wanted to be dictator, he would have just refused to leave.
[01:43:15.071 --> 01:43:16.712]  And everybody on January 6th, you're talking about Trump?
[01:43:17.193 --> 01:43:17.353]  Yeah.
[01:43:17.433 --> 01:43:19.254]  Everybody on January 6th would have showed up with guns.
[01:43:19.294 --> 01:43:23.096]  I mean, the fact that nobody was armed is indicative that there was no insurrection whatsoever.
[01:43:23.737 --> 01:43:26.158]  And those people had guns that were there protesting at home.
[01:43:27.239 --> 01:43:27.459]  Legal.
[01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:30.352]  Well, the cop had a gun when he shot Ashley Babbitt.
[01:43:30.412 --> 01:43:31.292]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:43:31.392 --> 01:43:32.013]  She sure didn't.
[01:43:56.274 --> 01:43:59.356]  The world laughs at Trump, literally.
[01:44:01.237 --> 01:44:03.559]  But folks, it is not funny.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.982]  When he was president, that meant the world was laughing at us.
[01:44:10.564 --> 01:44:13.385]  The threats we face are too serious.
[01:44:14.506 --> 01:44:19.429]  The sacrifices our service members make are too sacred.
[01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:25.874]  The alliances we've spent decades building are too critical.
[01:44:27.236 --> 01:44:29.298]  That's what's at stake now.
[01:44:30.378 --> 01:44:31.099]  And the choice?
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.201]  The choice isn't even close.
[01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:39.325]  But in Arizona and nationwide, this election will be.
[01:44:44.969 --> 01:44:54.717]  We'll win in the same way we launch rockets into space and land fighter jets on an aircraft carrier as one team on one mission.
[01:44:57.174 --> 01:45:02.757]  State by state, voter by voter, coming together.
[01:45:03.777 --> 01:45:09.920]  No country, no country is better than ours at solving big problems.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:23.346]  So, on November 5th, let's prove that America is still the leader the world needs today by electing the leader we need right now, Kamala Harris.
[01:45:23.979 --> 01:45:27.802]  That didn't even really make sense to mess up and catch himself and then not know how to correct it.
[01:45:28.562 --> 01:45:29.663]  That was some bizarre stuff.
[01:45:31.504 --> 01:45:36.747]  Next up we have former Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta coming up on the stage.
[01:45:36.787 --> 01:45:38.408]  Not sure if there's going to be a performance or an ad.
[01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.449]  Nope.
[01:45:39.809 --> 01:45:40.250]  Straight to him.
[01:45:54.471 --> 01:46:11.323]  My fellow Americans, I'm proud to have served in the Army, the Congress, the White House, Chief of Staff, CIA Director, and Secretary of Defense.
[01:46:18.287 --> 01:46:21.950]  I've looked into the eyes of our warriors
[01:46:23.058 --> 01:46:24.838]  And deployed them into battle.
[01:46:26.679 --> 01:46:40.822]  I gave the order, directing our special operations forces to fly two helicopters 150 miles into Abbottabad at night.
[01:46:42.743 --> 01:46:47.624]  And by the time the sun rose, Osama bin Laden was dead.
[01:46:57.376 --> 01:47:01.957]  Because nobody attacks our country and gets away with it.
[01:47:02.177 --> 01:47:08.038]  Nobody.
[01:47:08.878 --> 01:47:10.759]  That's what our warriors do.
[01:47:11.459 --> 01:47:12.919]  That's what our warriors do.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:22.742]  Our warriors need a tough, cool-headed commander-in-chief to defend our democracy,
[01:47:23.658 --> 01:47:33.608]  Okay, so this is proof if you didn't have it that she is definitely an insider.
[01:47:33.628 --> 01:47:34.429]  We already knew that.
[01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:36.711]  That she is definitely backed by the Deep State.
[01:47:37.412 --> 01:47:38.413]  We already knew that.
[01:47:41.627 --> 01:47:46.370]  She's literally appointed the candidate.
[01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:48.291]  She is a tyrant.
[01:47:48.611 --> 01:48:06.641]  A couple of months ago, Joe Biden came out after a Supreme Court ruling and said that the Supreme Court had declared that the President of the United States now has unlimited power, while he was President of the United States, and tried to pawn it off as a problem if Trump gets elected, but he declared himself dictator.
[01:48:12.301 --> 01:48:14.722]  We tried that in the 1930s.
[01:48:16.382 --> 01:48:21.784]  It was foolish and dangerous then, and it's foolish and dangerous now.
[01:48:27.525 --> 01:48:29.006]  Listen to President Reagan.
[01:48:29.566 --> 01:48:30.406]  President Reagan.
[01:48:31.858 --> 01:48:40.701]  Isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments.
[01:48:41.241 --> 01:48:41.521]  Never.
[01:48:41.841 --> 01:48:42.901]  Oh my gosh.
[01:48:45.622 --> 01:48:51.644]  Trump tells tyrants, like Putin, they can do whatever the hell they want.
[01:48:53.465 --> 01:48:59.446]  Kamala Harris tells tyrants, the hell you can, not on my watch.
[01:48:59.506 --> 01:49:01.187]  And nobody tells me what to do.
[01:49:03.692 --> 01:49:10.397]  She's worked with President Zelensky to fight back against Russia.
[01:49:10.657 --> 01:49:15.480]  She knows that protecting their democracy protects our democracy as well.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.961]  Donald Trump does not understand the world.
[01:49:27.719 --> 01:49:34.080]  And he does not understand the service and sacrifice of our military.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:39.581]  Our fallen veterans are not suckers.
[01:49:40.361 --> 01:49:41.962]  They are not losers.
[01:49:42.442 --> 01:49:43.822]  They are our heroes!
[01:49:45.902 --> 01:49:47.442]  Lies again, again, and again.
[01:49:52.203 --> 01:49:55.724]  Kamala Harris will honor our veterans.
[01:49:57.054 --> 01:50:06.656]  And in Tim Walz, we will have a vice president who has served in uniform honorably for 24 years.
[01:50:06.716 --> 01:50:11.697]  Yeah, but stolen valor, right?
[01:50:12.257 --> 01:50:15.118]  So... Kamala Harris... What is going on here?
[01:50:15.458 --> 01:50:17.879]  ...understands this moment.
[01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:23.360]  It is a moment of danger and a moment of opportunity.
[01:50:24.645 --> 01:50:29.727]  She'll keep America's military the strongest in the world.
[01:50:30.227 --> 01:50:32.108]  Arguably not even the strongest in the world now.
[01:50:33.389 --> 01:50:37.750]  And she understands what our military is for.
[01:50:38.151 --> 01:50:42.812]  The role of our military is to defend us from foreign enemies.
[01:50:43.253 --> 01:50:48.655]  It is not to threaten Americans, and it sure as hell isn't to put immigrants in camps.
[01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:59.275]  As they update the documents to put us in re-education camps and brag about it and repeat that Trump supporters and voters and their children need to be taken away and put in re-education camps.
[01:50:59.575 --> 01:51:00.415]  To hell with this guy.
[01:51:00.595 --> 01:51:14.182]  Every president since World War II, Republican and Democrat, has shared the belief that America must protect democracy in the world.
[01:51:16.147 --> 01:51:21.672]  Every president has honored our veterans and their sacrifices.
[01:51:22.933 --> 01:51:23.694]  Every president.
[01:51:24.795 --> 01:51:25.395]  But one.
[01:51:26.396 --> 01:51:26.917]  But one.
[01:51:27.177 --> 01:51:28.478]  Yeah, no new wars, asshole.
[01:51:28.498 --> 01:51:30.920]  So we face a critical choice.
[01:51:32.522 --> 01:51:39.047]  Honor our veterans as we leave them behind in Afghanistan, resulting in the death of thousands of innocent people.
[01:51:39.468 --> 01:51:43.011]  As we fund millions of dollars every month to the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and others.
[01:51:45.379 --> 01:51:49.843]  Some organizations, specifically associated with Tim Walz himself, who lied about his service in the military.
[01:51:49.883 --> 01:51:52.184]  This is just, this is deep state.
[01:51:52.224 --> 01:51:53.565]  This is the face of deep state.
[01:51:53.585 --> 01:51:54.726]  I mean, you're looking right at it.
[01:51:55.067 --> 01:51:56.628]  This is not convoluted deep state.
[01:51:56.868 --> 01:51:58.849]  This is not interpreting the deep state through headlines.
[01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:01.572]  This is only one degree of separation away.
[01:52:01.592 --> 01:52:04.094]  You're looking right at it, right in the eyes, right now.
[01:52:11.244 --> 01:52:20.713]  Our allies will cheer, our enemies will fear, and we will have a commander-in-chief that we can trust.
[01:52:21.253 --> 01:52:24.176]  God bless our veterans and God bless our country.
[01:52:28.299 --> 01:52:35.926]  Alright folks, the only reason that we're able to cover this with some honest analysis as it goes on, and Alex Jones is in the studio, he will be in the chair any minute.
[01:52:37.093 --> 01:52:45.816]  The only reason we're able to do this is because of our audience and our listeners and the great info warriors out there, the great patriots out there who have kept us on the air for decades now.
[01:52:46.236 --> 01:52:48.597]  Now we know the New World Order is coming after us, trying to shut us down.
[01:52:48.637 --> 01:52:59.341]  We just watch the deep state basically try to make the case for World War III and admit that Kamala Harris is a total puppet of whatever the CIA wants, whatever the military-industrial complex wants.
[01:53:00.779 --> 01:53:05.260]  Propping up fake governments, false governments, unseating legitimate governments, all sorts.
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:08.201]  Everything evil that we talk about here was manifest in that short speech.
[01:53:08.241 --> 01:53:08.961]  It was unbelievable.
[01:53:08.981 --> 01:53:11.142]  I mean, I knew this was going to be evil and boring, but it was unbelievable.
[01:53:11.742 --> 01:53:13.143]  And they're coming after us here at Infowars.
[01:53:13.163 --> 01:53:14.063]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:53:14.723 --> 01:53:15.763]  Every week could be the last.
[01:53:15.843 --> 01:53:18.944]  We always feel like it's a miracle that we're here every day that we're on air.
[01:53:18.964 --> 01:53:27.707]  But the only reason we were able to do this, this special reporting, the staying late, the having Alex Jones come back to the studio, the turning the lights on, having the crew here to broadcast the truth.
[01:53:28.567 --> 01:53:48.283]  At times when the liars are trying to steal the airways and monopolize all information consumption in the United States is because you go to InfoWarsStore.com and because you share the clips at Band.Video, because you follow Alex Jones at RealAlexJones or at InfoWars on X, and share the posts, share the clips, share the truth, and make it go viral.
[01:53:48.303 --> 01:53:49.204]  The truth is going viral.
[01:53:49.224 --> 01:53:51.446]  It's why they want to shut down X, and it's why they want to shut down InfoWars.
[01:53:51.466 --> 01:53:56.590]  So it's so important that we stay on the air, especially since this is the most important election in the history of America.
[01:53:56.610 --> 01:53:57.751]  And the best way
[01:53:58.351 --> 01:54:02.293]  In my opinion, that you can do that is by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:02.353 --> 01:54:10.015]  The best way that you can save American humanity itself is by going to InfoWarsStore.com and purchasing something from us to keep us on the air.
[01:54:10.035 --> 01:54:11.376]  But this isn't a charity thing.
[01:54:11.416 --> 01:54:16.558]  We're not just asking you to buy something you don't want or don't need for the sake of keeping us on the air.
[01:54:16.998 --> 01:54:22.520]  We are offering amazing products, the highest quality products, perhaps in the history of supplementation.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:26.722]  And we have for years at amazing prices that actually benefit you.
[01:54:26.782 --> 01:54:27.402]  Now we have products
[01:54:27.862 --> 01:54:28.082]  We're good.
[01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:28.363]  We're good.
[01:54:28.383 --> 01:54:28.583]  We're good.
[01:54:28.603 --> 01:54:28.883]  We're good.
[01:54:28.903 --> 01:54:29.303]  We're good.
[01:54:29.363 --> 01:54:29.924]  We're good.
[01:54:29.944 --> 01:54:30.264]  We're good.
[01:54:30.284 --> 01:54:30.504]  We're good.
[01:54:30.544 --> 01:54:30.985]  We're good.
[01:54:31.145 --> 01:54:31.605]  We're good.
[01:54:31.625 --> 01:54:31.986]  We're good.
[01:54:32.006 --> 01:54:33.026]  We're good.
[01:54:33.187 --> 01:54:33.527]  We're good.
[01:54:33.547 --> 01:54:34.167]  We're good.
[01:54:34.207 --> 01:54:34.568]  We're good.
[01:54:34.608 --> 01:54:34.968]  We're good.
[01:54:35.008 --> 01:54:35.508]  We're good.
[01:54:35.569 --> 01:54:36.049]  We're good.
[01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.469]  We're good.
[01:54:36.509 --> 01:54:36.769]  We're good.
[01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:37.050]  We're good.
[01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.330]  We're good.
[01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.630]  We're good.
[01:54:37.650 --> 01:54:38.291]  We're good.
[01:54:38.311 --> 01:54:38.691]  We're good.
[01:54:38.711 --> 01:54:38.971]  We're good.
[01:54:38.991 --> 01:54:39.272]  We're good.
[01:54:39.392 --> 01:54:39.672]  We're good.
[01:54:39.692 --> 01:54:40.032]  We're good.
[01:54:40.052 --> 01:54:40.372]  We're good.
[01:54:40.793 --> 01:54:41.373]  We're good.
[01:54:41.393 --> 01:54:41.694]  We're good.
[01:54:41.734 --> 01:54:42.094]  We're good.
[01:54:42.114 --> 01:54:42.374]  We're good.
[01:54:42.394 --> 01:54:42.634]  We're good.
[01:54:42.674 --> 01:54:42.935]  We're good.
[01:54:42.955 --> 01:54:43.155]  We're good.
[01:54:43.175 --> 01:54:43.395]  We're good.
[01:54:43.415 --> 01:54:43.655]  We're good.
[01:54:43.675 --> 01:54:44.276]  We're good.
[01:54:44.296 --> 01:54:44.556]  We're good.
[01:54:44.576 --> 01:54:44.936]  We're good.
[01:54:44.976 --> 01:54:45.457]  We're good.
[01:54:45.477 --> 01:54:45.677]  We're good.
[01:54:45.697 --> 01:54:45.897]  We're good.
[01:54:45.937 --> 01:54:46.257]  We're good.
[01:54:46.277 --> 01:54:46.478]  We're good.
[01:54:46.498 --> 01:54:46.758]  We're good.
[01:54:46.778 --> 01:54:47.018]  We're good.
[01:54:47.038 --> 01:54:47.518]  We're good.
[01:54:47.819 --> 01:54:48.199]  We're good.
[01:54:48.259 --> 01:54:48.719]  We're good.
[01:54:48.739 --> 01:54:48.980]  We're good.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:49.260]  We're good.
[01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:49.600]  We're good.
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:49.820]  We're good.
[01:54:53.223 --> 01:54:53.804]  We're good to go.
[01:54:53.824 --> 01:54:54.264]  We're good to go.
[01:54:54.284 --> 01:54:54.844]  We're good to go.
[01:54:54.864 --> 01:54:55.325]  We're good to go.
[01:54:55.345 --> 01:54:55.725]  We're good to go.
[01:54:55.745 --> 01:54:56.165]  We're good to go.
[01:54:56.185 --> 01:54:56.646]  We're good to go.
[01:54:56.666 --> 01:54:57.526]  We're good to go.
[01:54:57.546 --> 01:54:57.887]  We're good to go.
[01:54:57.907 --> 01:54:58.227]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.247 --> 01:54:58.647]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.667 --> 01:54:59.247]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.488 --> 01:54:59.868]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.908 --> 01:55:00.268]  We're good to go.
[01:55:00.288 --> 01:55:00.869]  We're good to go.
[01:55:00.929 --> 01:55:01.289]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.309 --> 01:55:01.669]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.689 --> 01:55:02.130]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:02.570]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:03.210]  We're good to go.
[01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:03.711]  We're good to go.
[01:55:03.791 --> 01:55:04.211]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.231 --> 01:55:04.852]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.872 --> 01:55:05.592]  We're good to go.
[01:55:05.612 --> 01:55:06.293]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.333 --> 01:55:07.113]  We're good to go.
[01:55:07.173 --> 01:55:08.154]  We're good to go.
[01:55:08.174 --> 01:55:08.915]  We're good to go.
[01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:09.595]  We're good to go.
[01:55:09.615 --> 01:55:10.215]  We're good to go.
[01:55:10.235 --> 01:55:10.856]  We're good to go.
[01:55:10.876 --> 01:55:11.216]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.236 --> 01:55:11.817]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.857 --> 01:55:12.477]  We're good to go.
[01:55:12.497 --> 01:55:12.917]  We're good to go.
[01:55:12.957 --> 01:55:13.578]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.598 --> 01:55:14.218]  We're good to go.
[01:55:14.238 --> 01:55:14.358]  We're
[01:55:20.803 --> 01:55:22.704]  We know that heart health is the topic of conversation.
[01:55:22.724 --> 01:55:25.766]  Heart disease is one of the number one causes of death in the United States of America.
[01:55:26.047 --> 01:55:30.410]  We know that there's been reports of increased myocarditis and other heart issues for people of all ages.
[01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:35.273]  So getting Nitric Boost for 40% off at Infowarsstore.com is an amazing solution.
[01:55:35.553 --> 01:55:41.317]  We've also got 40% off now for Brain Force Ultra, which is the tincture form of Brain Force Plus.
[01:55:41.777 --> 01:55:44.219]  Brain Force Ultra, folks, will light you up like a Christmas tree.
[01:55:44.259 --> 01:55:46.860]  You will notice a change in your state of mind within 20 minutes.
[01:55:47.361 --> 01:55:50.203]  I love the Brain Force Ultra because it's got that black pepper extract.
[01:55:50.963 --> 01:55:59.345]  Excuse me, the Brain Force Plus does, and the Brain Force Ultra is an even more powerful, potent, and efficient form of this supplement for you to consume to be as sharp as possible.
[01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:05.306]  Look, there's a war on for your mind, so Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra are there for your mind.
[01:56:05.586 --> 01:56:07.226]  There's a war on for your body itself.
[01:56:07.246 --> 01:56:13.668]  I'm mutilating our children, so we've got bodies 25% off, vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips, so it's actually bioavailable for 40% off.
[01:56:14.528 --> 01:56:18.269]  They're attacking your body and your mind and your freedom all at the same time.
[01:56:18.529 --> 01:56:29.093]  This is one of the only ways that you can actually fight back on all three of those fronts at the same time by going to InfoWarsStore.com right now, looking through our products and picking out what is best for you.
[01:56:29.373 --> 01:56:32.134]  I was somebody who did not believe at all in supplementation before.
[01:56:32.174 --> 01:56:42.018]  I thought our body flushed most of it out, but then I started taking the supplements that are laying around here at the InfoWars Command Center here in Austin, Texas, and I noticed a difference in my health, especially my mental focus and clarity and energy.
[01:56:42.538 --> 01:56:45.379]  Also, supporting our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:56:45.399 --> 01:56:47.000]  That's drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:50.681]  It's a great way to fight for your health and support Alex and his family as well.
[01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:52.422]  I love next-level foundational energy.
[01:56:53.042 --> 01:56:54.503]  It'll light you up like a Christmas tree as well.
[01:56:54.543 --> 01:56:57.404]  Trust me, sometimes I can't fall asleep if I take it too late in the day, so be careful.
[01:56:57.464 --> 01:56:58.024]  It's powerful.
[01:56:58.344 --> 01:57:03.686]  And Shroom Force is Rex Jones' new development, which I'm very anxious to try for 33% off.
[01:57:03.706 --> 01:57:05.267]  So please go to infowarrestore.com.
[01:57:06.167 --> 01:57:09.208]  Pick out something or go to Dr Jones Dr Jones naturals dot com.
[01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:14.711]  Pick something out and if you can't afford to do it, even though it's not an expense and it is an investment, if you can't afford to do it, I understand.
[01:57:14.751 --> 01:57:19.233]  But then please go to band video or go to at reality Jones and share the broadcast.
[01:57:19.613 --> 01:57:23.915]  Share something so others can invest in this fight for freedom as well.
[01:57:23.975 --> 01:57:25.155]  Folks, this is absolutely insane.
[01:57:25.315 --> 01:57:26.056]  Who's speaking now?
[01:57:26.116 --> 01:57:26.316]  Is it?
[01:57:26.756 --> 01:57:29.197]  Is it Ruben Gallego still or is it Governor Gretchen Whitmer?
[01:57:29.217 --> 01:57:29.898]  Because she's coming up.
[01:57:29.938 --> 01:57:35.080]  She's the wicked witch of the left coming up and you guys are going to have to see this because we have a duty to show you.
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.881]  The corruption of the left.
[01:57:38.423 --> 01:57:39.944]  Let's go ahead and show what's on stage right now.
[01:57:39.964 --> 01:57:42.587]  Oh, they're bringing out somebody else in a wheelchair to exploit for political gain.
[01:57:48.953 --> 01:57:49.233]  Okay.
[01:57:49.873 --> 01:57:50.834]  Well, we've got a short report.
[01:57:52.776 --> 01:57:54.818]  We've got a short report from Alex coming up right now.
[01:57:55.118 --> 01:57:56.920]  Afterwards, Alex Jones will be on the air.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.904]  So we're going to toss to that and wait until relevant speakers actually show up on the stage.
[01:58:02.844 --> 01:58:09.229]  With only 75 days left to the election, and the Deep State desperate, President Trump's life has never been in more danger.
[01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:10.690]  But not from Iran.
[01:58:12.172 --> 01:58:15.614]  The Deep State is preparing another attempt on President Trump's life.
[01:58:16.275 --> 01:58:18.657]  And this time, they're going to frame Iran for it.
[01:58:26.443 --> 01:58:27.244]  InfoWars.
[01:58:27.564 --> 01:58:29.225]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:58:30.786 --> 01:58:32.388]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:58:33.592 --> 01:58:36.274]  President Trump's life is in serious danger.
[01:58:37.354 --> 01:58:44.199]  The deep state already tried to kill him and failed on July 13th of this year, just 40-something days ago.
[01:58:45.059 --> 01:58:53.545]  And two days after it happened, I came out and said, the deep state is going to try again, and they're going to try to frame Iran.
[01:58:54.365 --> 01:58:57.127]  And now they are officially doing it.
[01:58:58.508 --> 01:59:02.010]  The big move is to hit him with a large truck bomb.
[01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:06.491]  Again, it's in the cards to use a small nuclear weapon and blame the Iranians.
[01:59:07.711 --> 01:59:08.671]  They'll be the fall guys.
[01:59:09.732 --> 01:59:11.612]  And then instantly, we're in full war with Russia.
[01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.433]  Instantly, the air raid sirens are going off.
[01:59:14.553 --> 01:59:16.653]  Instantly, life as you know it is over.
[01:59:17.573 --> 01:59:27.876]  And they're going to use the war to try to get Americans to, oh my god, you know, we got hit by a nuke, Iran, Iran, you know, with Russia, you know, and then everybody's off the air except the corporate news.
[01:59:29.841 --> 01:59:36.006]  Then you're going to see all hell break loose because there are people inside all those corporate news organizations and inside the government that are our people.
[01:59:36.647 --> 01:59:38.048]  Everyone's going to know it's the Deep State.
[01:59:38.068 --> 01:59:39.389]  They're not going to be able to blame it on Iran.
[01:59:39.409 --> 01:59:40.249]  That's who they're going to do it.
[01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:42.511]  That's who they're going to blame it on.
[01:59:42.571 --> 01:59:43.832]  And I know there are scenarios.
[01:59:45.334 --> 01:59:47.335]  And so it's not alarmist to say this.
[01:59:47.355 --> 01:59:51.458]  And I think we need to really get on the table out front to the globalists.
[01:59:51.919 --> 01:59:52.819]  We know your plans.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.740]  We know your operations.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:54.501]  We know your history.
[01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:59.422]  And again, what do they do to get the sympathy back or to change the subject?
[01:59:59.483 --> 02:00:00.823]  Some horrible event.
[02:00:02.304 --> 02:00:07.145]  And again, if their next assassination attempt fails, if they're unable to poison him, that's the default.
[02:00:07.165 --> 02:00:08.006]  They're gonna try to poison him.
[02:00:08.886 --> 02:00:21.551]  And if they can't get a shooter in, and if they can't get a truck bomb in close enough, if they put the barricades far enough back in Milwaukee, they're gonna wait till he's back in Mar-a-Lago or somewhere and roll a truck bomb in there.
[02:00:22.011 --> 02:00:22.371]  Guaranteed.
[02:00:23.647 --> 02:00:25.148]  And say the Iranians did it.
[02:00:25.829 --> 02:00:27.870]  Now that's just one example of dozens.
[02:00:28.651 --> 02:00:41.801]  Just days after I predicted it, and then a few days after I predicted that, four days after he got grazed in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI came out and said, we have credible threats at the mulas.
[02:00:42.842 --> 02:00:47.506]  Over in Iran, the Ayatollah is trying to kill Trump and might have been involved.
[02:00:48.087 --> 02:00:50.789]  Oh, did the mullahs have the Secret Service stand down?
[02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.171]  Did they pull most of the security off?
[02:00:54.032 --> 02:01:02.640]  Did the mullahs have the Secret Service not point the man out on the roof for over 26 minutes or 90 minutes down below with a rangefinder and now we know a rifle?
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:05.542]  Man, those mullahs have magical powers.
[02:01:06.443 --> 02:01:21.711]  So now, there's an article in Newsmax, similar propaganda everywhere, from conservative media we can trust, that, oh, absolutely, there's a big plot to kill Trump and the Ayatollah wants him dead before the election.
[02:01:22.212 --> 02:01:24.633]  I wonder who else wants him dead before the election.
[02:01:25.013 --> 02:01:31.717]  And Trump really fell into this trap when Netanyahu spoke to Congress a few weeks ago and said the Mullahs are going to try to kill Trump.
[02:01:32.077 --> 02:01:35.399]  And Trump said on Truth Social, well, if they kill me, destroy Iran!
[02:01:37.025 --> 02:01:38.826]  They actually sent death squads.
[02:01:39.927 --> 02:01:45.712]  They sent death squads here to murder a former Secretary of State and a former National Security Advisor.
[02:01:46.392 --> 02:01:51.076]  And as we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President Trump.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:57.320]  We're good to go.
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:58.281]  We're good to go.
[02:02:15.205 --> 02:02:26.870]  All right, we were going to be getting joined here soon by Roger Stone, Luke Rudowsky and others, but Governor Whitmer, who staged a kidnapping plot against herself, the same FBI team that set us up on January 6th, is speaking right now.
[02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:30.472]  So before we go to Roger here in a moment, as soon as they're ready, let's go back to Governor Whitmer.
[02:02:30.512 --> 02:02:30.832]  Here it is.
[02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:37.095]  To tell the truth and to bring people together.
[02:02:38.676 --> 02:02:43.838]  Right now, before the crisis, is when we get to choose.
[02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:52.752]  Why wouldn't we choose the leader who's tough, tested, and a total badass?
[02:03:01.314 --> 02:03:04.715]  I know who I want as our Commander-in-Chief.
[02:03:05.215 --> 02:03:08.115]  America, let's choose Kamala Harris.
[02:03:09.176 --> 02:03:11.936]  And she has the energy of an old shoe.
[02:03:13.417 --> 02:03:14.637]  Boy, that wasn't long at all.
[02:03:16.141 --> 02:03:18.864]  I mean, she was up like three minutes?
[02:03:19.765 --> 02:03:20.266]  Four minutes?
[02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:23.990]  Wow, that lady is really evil.
[02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:25.332]  She's the co-chair of the campaign.
[02:03:25.352 --> 02:03:25.933]  Okay.
[02:03:32.372 --> 02:03:36.973]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Governor Whitmer, they had three trials, twice they had to let people go.
[02:03:36.993 --> 02:03:39.294]  Third time they finally convicted some people.
[02:03:39.814 --> 02:03:41.854]  The FBI literally commanded the whole operation.
[02:03:41.894 --> 02:03:42.834]  Nobody ever tried to kidnap her.
[02:03:42.854 --> 02:03:49.296]  There were a bunch of potheads that we give money to, and on the recordings that finally had to be released, they're like, I don't want to hurt anybody.
[02:03:49.376 --> 02:03:51.216]  I just want a hamburger and some weed.
[02:03:51.236 --> 02:03:54.657]  And the feds are like, no, you're going to kidnap Whitmer next week.
[02:03:55.477 --> 02:03:56.517]  I guess I'll kidnap her.
[02:03:56.537 --> 02:03:57.458]  Just give me $1,000 and some Big Macs.
[02:04:00.371 --> 02:04:05.094]  And so let's go and see if Luke Rudowsky and the great Roger Stone, the great Luke Rudowsky and crew can hear me.
[02:04:05.134 --> 02:04:08.716]  I just wanted to get their take on this train wreck.
[02:04:08.736 --> 02:04:24.804]  Really, what comes out of it is the amazing clips of the head of the Department of Commerce saying that she doesn't know what the Department of Labor Statistics is, and also a parade of people saying Kamala was a great border czar.
[02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:26.105]  I thought she wasn't a border czar.
[02:04:26.765 --> 02:04:27.846]  Guys, how are you doing?
[02:04:29.005 --> 02:04:29.885]  We're doing very good.
[02:04:29.925 --> 02:04:38.930]  We're live right now on TheBestPoliticoShow.com, and of course, we've been going through all the latest developments, all the latest news happening right now, and it's pretty crazy.
[02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:43.452]  It's pretty daunting to see the kind of psyops, the propaganda, play out in real time.
[02:04:43.472 --> 02:04:51.316]  We're blessed to have Roger Stone here with us that has given us a lot of different history lessons tonight about all the larger conspiracies unfolding here.
[02:04:51.356 --> 02:04:53.137]  Roger, what's your assessment from everything?
[02:04:53.377 --> 02:05:02.920]  Well, first of all, props to Alex Jones, who had the world exclusive and broke the story that I think is going to prove to be absolutely accurate, and that is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:08.262]  is going to end his campaign for president and join and support the campaign of Donald Trump.
[02:05:08.822 --> 02:05:11.203]  I was entirely skeptical when I first heard this.
[02:05:11.683 --> 02:05:13.263]  I took it with a grain of salt.
[02:05:13.363 --> 02:05:17.985]  I said, wow, what a great head fake that would be if you were trying to get publicity for your campaign.
[02:05:18.465 --> 02:05:21.286]  But Alex, I think you're going to turn out to be absolutely right.
[02:05:21.366 --> 02:05:25.827]  I think this is going down, and it is why the Democrats are apoplectic.
[02:05:26.227 --> 02:05:28.308]  It is why they are hysterical.
[02:05:28.688 --> 02:05:36.831]  They see a great unification of those who recognize the power and evil corruption of the deep state, and they're not very happy.
[02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:37.811]  This will
[02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:44.977]  Kill any momentum they might have gotten out of this charade that they put on national television.
[02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:50.682]  It is a huge, seismic political development, and Alex Jones, you called it first.
[02:05:51.222 --> 02:05:59.830]  I know your amazing audience has already heard all the great points your guest Luke and Roger have had to say, but my audience
[02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:01.390]  Has not had the benefit of that.
[02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:05.551]  I'm sure a lot of your audience tunes in and tunes out, so I'd like to give all of you guys the floor.
[02:06:06.392 --> 02:06:13.053]  You know, for the next 30 minutes or so, or until we see Kamala come out anytime you guys want to pause and go to what they're saying.
[02:06:15.174 --> 02:06:17.674]  You're pretty much hosting the show here because I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:06:17.694 --> 02:06:19.475]  Everybody's heard what I have to say, but back to the Kennedy thing.
[02:06:20.618 --> 02:06:30.293]  I got a call a couple nights ago a couple afternoons ago because I put out a report saying I think it would be a great thing for him to do, and I hope he does it.
[02:06:31.099 --> 02:06:33.701]  And so I made some calls, and they said, Yeah, we hear he is dropping out.
[02:06:33.741 --> 02:06:36.704]  And then I got another call from someone I've known for a long time.
[02:06:37.344 --> 02:06:38.365]  It's actually pretty well known.
[02:06:38.405 --> 02:06:38.886]  It's not deal.
[02:06:38.926 --> 02:06:41.188]  Big tree works for his campaign, but it's somebody like that.
[02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:52.757]  And they said, Yeah, he's going to do a special press streamer to the whole Internet Friday, and they're assembling the big media team.
[02:06:59.775 --> 02:07:02.856]  Then I got a call last night that said, well, now it's in Phoenix.
[02:07:03.656 --> 02:07:09.319]  So this came directly from his campaign, and I asked the person, why are you telling me this?
[02:07:09.879 --> 02:07:10.439]  Does Kennedy know?
[02:07:10.479 --> 02:07:15.581]  And they said, no, but we just think, you know, we love you, and it's going to come out anyways, and so we just want to give you this.
[02:07:16.141 --> 02:07:17.924]  And I've known this person a long time.
[02:07:18.925 --> 02:07:19.506]  I believe them.
[02:07:19.526 --> 02:07:20.167]  They're a good person.
[02:07:20.187 --> 02:07:21.388]  So then I made some other phone calls.
[02:07:21.408 --> 02:07:22.570]  They're like, yeah, how do you know that?
[02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:24.112]  Because RFK Jr.
[02:07:24.132 --> 02:07:26.075]  has a really big fan club here in Austin.
[02:07:26.435 --> 02:07:30.401]  I got the information from somebody outside of Austin, but he has a big base of people here.
[02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:32.383]  So I called some of his people here and they said, yeah.
[02:07:33.224 --> 02:07:35.907]  Uh, and, uh, you know, I said, Well, I'm gonna break it, and I said, Fine.
[02:07:35.967 --> 02:07:37.007]  It probably was going to hurt anything.
[02:07:37.308 --> 02:07:41.131]  So it's not like I have a crystal ball, and I predicted this.
[02:07:41.331 --> 02:07:50.279]  It's like I didn't predict lockdowns and mask and six ft of social distancing in Operation Lockstep, published in 2010 by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:07:50.959 --> 02:07:52.460]  They said they would do all of this.
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:57.802]  It's been the Rockefeller Foundation quarterbacking John Hopkins and Bill Gates and all of this.
[02:07:58.042 --> 02:08:00.022]  So that's how I know these things.
[02:08:00.102 --> 02:08:01.363]  It's not a damn crystal ball.
[02:08:01.823 --> 02:08:03.664]  That's why I said two days after they tried to kill Trump.
[02:08:04.770 --> 02:08:11.134]  I said they are going to blame the Iranians for this, and two days later, four days after, they said, oh, the Iranians did it.
[02:08:11.194 --> 02:08:18.119]  Now we see the drumbeat that they're going to kill Trump, that the Mullahs, the Ayatollah has ordered him killed before election day.
[02:08:18.139 --> 02:08:22.562]  And I'm even seeing prominent conservatives now saying Crooks was run by Iranians with no evidence.
[02:08:22.782 --> 02:08:25.904]  Did the Iranians order the Secret Service to stand down and pull back his detail?
[02:08:26.165 --> 02:08:27.866]  Did the Iranians cover up the scene of the crime?
[02:08:28.106 --> 02:08:28.706]  No, no, no.
[02:08:30.587 --> 02:08:38.832]  So anybody saying it's the Iranians is absolutely on the payroll or mentally ill or has an IQ below room temperature.
[02:08:39.312 --> 02:08:44.896]  And to expand on that, and I'm going to go back to you guys, ladies and gentlemen, they won't just kill Trump.
[02:08:44.916 --> 02:08:47.237]  They're going to blame Iran, launch a full war,
[02:08:47.577 --> 02:08:51.898]  Then Iran will activate its sleeper cells of Hamas and Hezbollah, mainly Hezbollah.
[02:08:52.198 --> 02:08:53.999]  They have literally hundreds of thousands of them in the U.S.
[02:08:54.039 --> 02:08:54.399]  and Europe.
[02:08:54.719 --> 02:09:01.301]  And then we are going to have total bedlam, which the deep state will use to oppose as the savior, come in and put us under a permanent martial law.
[02:09:01.321 --> 02:09:06.643]  So we are down to the wire, and that's why I am so upset and getting everybody's attention on this Iran thing.
[02:09:06.923 --> 02:09:10.706]  Anybody saying the Iranians are going to kill Trump, and Trump walked into the trap.
[02:09:10.726 --> 02:09:11.267]  I love him to death.
[02:09:11.287 --> 02:09:15.370]  They put him on Trump social when Netanyahu spoke to Congress and said the Iranians might try to kill Trump.
[02:09:15.811 --> 02:09:18.233]  Trump goes, well, if they do kill me, blow up Iran.
[02:09:18.533 --> 02:09:22.056]  He just gave them an invitation from the deep state to kill him and blame Iran.
[02:09:22.276 --> 02:09:24.498]  And I said, when he did that a few weeks ago, they're going to build this up.
[02:09:24.898 --> 02:09:27.120]  So that's what's going to happen if they can.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:29.642]  They're now going to try to kill Trump again and blame Iran.
[02:09:29.703 --> 02:09:33.186]  I called it before they started this crap, and now they've got it at a crescendo.
[02:09:33.826 --> 02:09:39.310]  Give me your take on that, Roger, Luke Badowski crew, and then I want to hear your other angles on this fiasco that is the DNC.
[02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:42.612]  We were literally just talking about this just a few moments ago.
[02:09:42.652 --> 02:09:55.341]  We had this article pulled up by MSN, and we said this is the biggest story that we need to start focusing on right now, specifically as the corporate media in tandem through many articles are trying to, of course, allude Iran is involved here.
[02:09:55.361 --> 02:10:01.785]  This article by MSN Trump shooter had three encrypted overseas accounts, quote, amid Iranian plot threat.
[02:10:02.105 --> 02:10:02.405]  This is
[02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:17.981]  We're good to go.
[02:10:46.488 --> 02:10:50.670]  Yes, the lawfare is making it exceedingly challenging for him to even be on the ballot, but I have to think that
[02:11:08.496 --> 02:11:08.696]  Yes.
[02:11:08.776 --> 02:11:08.836]  Yes.
[02:11:23.473 --> 02:11:25.755]  That's when they had that long phone call right at the RNC.
[02:11:25.795 --> 02:11:28.457]  You saw them talking for allegedly like six hours plus.
[02:11:28.538 --> 02:11:30.139]  That's probably what they discussed here.
[02:11:30.179 --> 02:11:38.286]  And if there was ever an opportune time to take the wind out of the sails of the democratic CIA connected establishment intelligentsia, it is right now.
[02:11:38.587 --> 02:11:45.933]  It is a day afterwards to of course get rid of this news cycle and make it a coalition of a lot of anti-establishment people.
[02:11:45.973 --> 02:11:46.754]  Tulsi Gabbard,
[02:11:47.774 --> 02:11:48.235]  R.F.K.
[02:11:48.275 --> 02:11:48.575]  Jr.
[02:11:48.875 --> 02:11:53.318]  coming together with Donald Trump, as of course Tulsi Gabbard was just put on a terror watch list.
[02:11:53.358 --> 02:11:55.399]  We were just telling our audience about that specifically.
[02:11:55.719 --> 02:12:00.142]  This is a kind of coalescing of all the people who clearly have been screwed over.
[02:12:00.262 --> 02:12:01.683]  Roger Stone, screwed over.
[02:12:01.743 --> 02:12:07.486]  Had the FBI and the CIA literally show up at his doorstep and take him out of his own frickin' home.
[02:12:07.506 --> 02:12:08.227]  That's right.
[02:12:08.527 --> 02:12:10.388]  I don't want to get Roger... Sorry, Roger, go ahead.
[02:12:11.107 --> 02:12:11.927]  Go ahead.
[02:12:12.207 --> 02:12:13.807]  Alex, here's the interesting thing.
[02:12:13.868 --> 02:12:15.808]  Here's how diabolical this is.
[02:12:16.068 --> 02:12:18.408]  Obviously, it has a certain logic to it.
[02:12:18.428 --> 02:12:26.410]  In other words, Donald Trump, during his presidency, through the use of harsh sanctions, had basically bankrupted the Iranian state.
[02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:29.630]  They couldn't finance their nuclear weapons development program.
[02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:34.851]  They couldn't subsidize terrorism against Israel through Hamas and Ebola.
[02:12:34.871 --> 02:12:38.132]  So, to the public, it has a certain logic.
[02:12:38.892 --> 02:12:41.633]  Uh, and that's what's so diabolical about it.
[02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:53.695]  Uh, but it is definitely being propped up in the media, uh, as, uh, as, uh, the new Russia, just as Russia played this role in the 2020, pardon me, the 2016 election.
[02:12:53.715 --> 02:12:54.035]  That's right.
[02:12:54.095 --> 02:12:56.816]  Uh, they, it's just like take out one name, put in the other.
[02:12:56.976 --> 02:12:58.576]  And Roger, let me elaborate and get your take on this.
[02:12:58.596 --> 02:12:59.777]  I want to say this very slowly.
[02:12:59.837 --> 02:13:01.257]  I know not for you, but for some new viewers.
[02:13:02.353 --> 02:13:06.680]  I am on record in the days after they tried to kill Trump saying they're about to blame Iran when no one was.
[02:13:07.061 --> 02:13:10.406]  Then the FBI did it two days after I said it on the 16th.
[02:13:10.466 --> 02:13:12.229]  I started saying it on the 14th and 15th.
[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.633]  Okay, there's dozens of those clips because I know how they work.
[02:13:15.689 --> 02:13:18.310]  Then, now they've got hundreds of articles out saying U.S.
[02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:23.632]  officials say it's Iran, and you've got, oh, he had encrypted, you know, overseas.
[02:13:23.692 --> 02:13:31.054]  Vault 7 and Edward Snowden information shows us how the CIA can set up fake accounts to set up foreign governments or corporations.
[02:13:31.074 --> 02:13:41.018]  But separately, did the Mulas let him walk around for 90 minutes in Butler, Pennsylvania, and 26 minutes on the roof while he crawled around with a rifle, and before that with a rangefinder?
[02:13:41.038 --> 02:13:41.578]  Did they have
[02:13:42.378 --> 02:13:49.902]  The deputy head, who was really running it all, now the head of the Secret Service, Ronald Roe, lie to Congress and then be caught actually ordering the stand down?
[02:13:50.443 --> 02:13:52.684]  Did they put all the people on different radio channels?
[02:13:53.004 --> 02:13:54.005]  Did they do all of this?
[02:13:54.045 --> 02:13:58.407]  Did they tell the media not to cover it the first day and just say that Trump fell down?
[02:13:58.427 --> 02:14:05.311]  I mean, Iran sure says they wanted to get Trump before when he, you know, went along with killing one of their top generals.
[02:14:05.571 --> 02:14:07.172]  But Iran came out and said, this is not us.
[02:14:07.232 --> 02:14:07.893]  We don't want war.
[02:14:07.933 --> 02:14:08.573]  We're not behind it.
[02:14:08.613 --> 02:14:09.474]  We're not going to kill Trump.
[02:14:10.574 --> 02:14:11.075]  And so them
[02:14:12.205 --> 02:14:17.632]  In the deep state, hyping this is so dangerous and so obvious because it doesn't get rid of Trump.
[02:14:18.092 --> 02:14:20.995]  Again, it launches the war with Iran, pisses Americans off.
[02:14:21.015 --> 02:14:27.263]  So Roger, this is glaringly obvious to me that the mullahs don't control the Secret Service.
[02:14:28.084 --> 02:14:29.706]  We know who does, and that's
[02:14:30.286 --> 02:14:36.732]  Alexander Mayorkas, that's Garland, so your analysis of this and what we need to do.
[02:14:36.752 --> 02:14:49.042]  I think Trump needs to get out ahead of this and say, look, I don't like Iran, and I've been really tough on Iran, but Iran didn't have that stand down as all the evidence comes out that they definitely stood down and the police were really pissed off.
[02:14:49.262 --> 02:14:52.925]  And it wasn't the Secret Service now that shot the sniper, it's now the police.
[02:14:54.199 --> 02:14:58.505]  There are too many anomalies in the entire storyline now.
[02:14:58.926 --> 02:15:01.770]  Every week there are more questions than there are answers.
[02:15:02.671 --> 02:15:06.857]  I think it's becoming obvious to anyone who will look at it objectively.
[02:15:06.877 --> 02:15:09.781]  But my big concern, Alex, is not last time.
[02:15:10.422 --> 02:15:22.045]  My big concern is the next time, because I think Donald Trump is such an existential threat to the established order, to the two-party duopoly, to the war machine, that I fear they will try again.
[02:15:22.065 --> 02:15:24.366]  Maybe they won't try to shoot him again.
[02:15:24.446 --> 02:15:27.887]  Maybe it's something, you know, even more cataclysmic.
[02:15:27.907 --> 02:15:33.008]  Maybe they use a shoulder-launched missile to try to take his plane out of the sky.
[02:15:33.368 --> 02:15:34.129]  Or something like that.
[02:15:34.429 --> 02:15:54.768]  This is what I pray about every single day, because I believe that this is all—we talked about this on your show—I think this was all foreseen in the Bible, specifically in Samuel 1 and 2, verses 15 and 16 of Samuel 1, the story of the two kings, which I think is evocative of what's happened right here.
[02:15:55.428 --> 02:16:04.135]  Uh, where Saul, the evil king, in this case, uh, Biden, Obama, some combination, tried to kill David, the good king.
[02:16:04.175 --> 02:16:04.916]  They didn't try once.
[02:16:05.316 --> 02:16:07.477]  They tried three times, according to the Bible.
[02:16:07.938 --> 02:16:09.859]  My fear is that they will try to kill him again.
[02:16:09.879 --> 02:16:12.982]  And I pray that he will take that threat seriously.
[02:16:13.042 --> 02:16:13.482]  Well, that's right.
[02:16:13.502 --> 02:16:14.363]  They're more desperate than ever.
[02:16:14.403 --> 02:16:23.009]  Let's play a short clip of Trump on the border in Arizona today, uh, where, uh, now Kennedy has moved his press conference.
[02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:24.130]  I was told that was going to be in
[02:16:25.371 --> 02:16:29.675]  LA and you watch it'll be the press conference will be in Phoenix tomorrow.
[02:16:29.695 --> 02:16:31.377]  That was the latest I got last night.
[02:16:32.077 --> 02:16:33.239]  So watch that break.
[02:16:33.819 --> 02:16:36.221]  Here is President Trump telling a reporter we've got to get out of here.
[02:16:36.241 --> 02:16:36.722]  We're in danger.
[02:16:38.134 --> 02:16:38.514]  We're good to go.
[02:17:05.055 --> 02:17:16.604]  I'm going to get to the border, but I obviously have to ask you about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:17:17.244 --> 02:17:22.608]  If he endorses you, are you going to find a spot for him in your cabinet, and have you promised him anything in that regard?
[02:17:22.648 --> 02:17:25.951]  Well, we haven't talked about that yet, Ali, but we'll find out, and we'll see.
[02:17:25.991 --> 02:17:29.033]  I have a lot of respect for him, and I think he has a lot of respect for me.
[02:17:29.113 --> 02:17:29.814]  I've just heard this.
[02:17:29.834 --> 02:17:30.875]  There's news flashes.
[02:17:32.896 --> 02:17:35.277]  You know, we've had a good relationship for a long period of time.
[02:17:35.718 --> 02:17:37.699]  If he endorses, that would be an honor for me.
[02:17:38.099 --> 02:17:39.080]  But we're doing very well.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:40.881]  We're leading now, as you know, in the election.
[02:17:40.961 --> 02:17:45.543]  And we're leading in all of the major categories, like border, like economy, like all of that.
[02:17:45.583 --> 02:17:47.164]  It's really good.
[02:17:47.304 --> 02:17:47.825]  It's really good.
[02:17:47.845 --> 02:17:49.165]  Things are happening that are very good.
[02:17:49.426 --> 02:17:50.546]  He may also see that.
[02:17:50.926 --> 02:17:52.127]  But it would be my great honor.
[02:17:52.167 --> 02:17:55.269]  If he wants to endorse me, I have good respect for him.
[02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:58.531]  Smart guy, a little different, but very smart.
[02:17:58.791 --> 02:18:00.212]  And we will take his endorsement.
[02:18:00.598 --> 02:18:02.699]  Can we expect to see him on the stage with you tomorrow?
[02:18:02.799 --> 02:18:03.379]  Well, I don't know.
[02:18:03.439 --> 02:18:05.860]  I know we're in the same state, but we're still pretty far away.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:07.880]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.681]  If something happens, you'll be the first to know.
[02:18:10.061 --> 02:18:10.401]  Thank you, sir.
[02:18:10.421 --> 02:18:11.161]  Thank you very much.
[02:18:11.202 --> 02:18:14.703]  Now, sir, I do have one question here about the situation in this area.
[02:18:14.803 --> 02:18:16.763]  Obviously, an assassin tried to kill you.
[02:18:16.823 --> 02:18:17.564]  Yeah.
[02:18:17.584 --> 02:18:19.144]  Can I tell you something?
[02:18:19.264 --> 02:18:22.685]  We're in danger standing here talking, so let's not talk any longer.
[02:18:22.785 --> 02:18:23.686]  No, I know about it.
[02:18:24.186 --> 02:18:25.486]  But they don't want me standing here.
[02:18:25.526 --> 02:18:26.847]  They don't want you standing here either.
[02:18:27.047 --> 02:18:27.547]  Have a good time.
[02:18:29.249 --> 02:18:31.597]  Roger Stone, Luke Gronowski and Krug.
[02:18:31.637 --> 02:18:32.520]  Give me your take on that.
[02:18:34.997 --> 02:18:40.440]  Yeah, no, we have the clip pulled up here as well, as of course we were watching it along with you.
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:44.822]  And I think Donald Trump is starting to realize, yeah, you know, his life is in danger.
[02:18:44.882 --> 02:18:48.324]  There was someone that was making significant threats at it that is still loose.
[02:18:48.984 --> 02:18:59.410]  And I think, you know, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they failed the first time and that they were extremely desperate and that they were a cornered animal and that they're going to be doing the same once again.
[02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:14.456]  The stakes here are very big here because if you look at a Trump administration with an RFK inside of it, a Tulsi Gabbard inside of it, specifically maybe at the Secretary of State, maybe even an RFK as an Attorney General, this changes the game.
[02:19:14.496 --> 02:19:24.900]  This shifts the landscape so much that all the people who have been wielding these institutions for their own personal benefit, they could turn around and of course they understand now this is make or break right here.
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:28.462]  This is something that's going to be far bigger than just an election.
[02:19:28.482 --> 02:19:28.982]  This is going
[02:19:29.022 --> 02:19:31.185]  I totally agree.
[02:19:31.465 --> 02:19:35.451]  The fact he's bringing in this dream team and Elon Musk is panicking the living hell out of him.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:40.242]  Absolutely, and the plan for Iran has been a plan for a very long time.
[02:19:40.302 --> 02:19:47.206]  If you remember, General Wesley Clark warned about the larger Pentagon plan to invade all of these countries.
[02:19:47.226 --> 02:19:52.709]  The last country that he specifically mentioned when he was warning about this larger plan was, of course, Iran.
[02:19:52.889 --> 02:20:04.575]  I asked him about this a couple years ago, and he looked like he literally saw a freaking ghost when he was questioned about this very direct plan that the Pentagon has had in the works for a very long time now.
[02:20:04.895 --> 02:20:15.978]  To specifically start a wider kind of war, a wider kind of conflict that will bring in a lot of other countries like Russia and China that are getting more and more involved here as well.
[02:20:16.018 --> 02:20:24.101]  So this is the larger kind of escalations here along with escalations of what's happening in Russia right now that's being invaded by all the Ukrainian and U.S.
[02:20:24.181 --> 02:20:31.623]  mercenaries that are being sent over there that really do highlight a very dangerous time now for America more than almost any other time in its history.
[02:20:31.883 --> 02:20:35.266]  Well, the conundrum that Trump's put in is that if RFK Jr.
[02:20:35.306 --> 02:20:40.910]  does indeed endorse him tomorrow, as it appears that he will, well, he's already winning in the betting markets.
[02:20:41.010 --> 02:20:44.073]  I think that after the DNC, Kamala is essentially imploding.
[02:20:44.994 --> 02:20:51.159]  The higher probability that he will win this election also increases the probability that they will take another shot at him.
[02:20:51.579 --> 02:20:59.926]  And I think that's the conundrum that he's in, because if they think that they can't beat him at the ballot box or rig it, well, then they'll take him out extra judicially.
[02:20:59.966 --> 02:21:01.347]  And I think that's everybody's concern here.
[02:21:01.667 --> 02:21:02.167]  Absolutely.
[02:21:02.267 --> 02:21:09.892]  Don't forget that he was shot at and then just a few days later Biden was taken out of the race as well.
[02:21:09.932 --> 02:21:12.193]  So this is something that they've been coordinating for a long time.
[02:21:12.533 --> 02:21:20.658]  Yeah, the people who have been whining about democracy, democracy, democracy just engaged in the most anti-democratic process in American history.
[02:21:20.978 --> 02:21:26.341]  They deposed a sitting president who got 71% of the delegates and they nominated a woman
[02:21:26.781 --> 02:21:29.662]  Well, but if you want to see the ultimate poetic justice, though,
[02:21:43.268 --> 02:21:50.973]  Take the guy whose father and uncle were both murdered by the United States federal government, likely the CIA, and make him their boss.
[02:21:51.733 --> 02:21:57.576]  Trump, you have an opportunity to make the most historic counter move in chess history.
[02:21:57.596 --> 02:21:58.597]  I hope he does it.
[02:21:58.737 --> 02:21:59.398]  Yeah, not likely.
[02:21:59.438 --> 02:22:00.679]  We interviewed RFK Jr.
[02:22:00.719 --> 02:22:03.361]  and he said, who's responsible for the killing of your loved ones?
[02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:04.562]  He was like, the intel agencies.
[02:22:04.822 --> 02:22:05.663]  Obviously, it's clear.
[02:22:05.923 --> 02:22:06.664]  It's clear as day.
[02:22:06.964 --> 02:22:12.629]  And I think it's fair to say that the same institution that took out the Kennedys tried to take out Donald Trump.
[02:22:12.649 --> 02:22:15.371]  And that's why we're seeing such a kind of alliance right now.
[02:22:15.472 --> 02:22:15.912]  Exactly.
[02:22:16.052 --> 02:22:19.473]  It's so ironic to see how the person that's being called the most divisive is actually the most unifying here.
[02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:43.200]  I actually, it's interesting you say that.
[02:22:43.641 --> 02:22:50.585]  I published on Substack about four hours ago a piece saying the perfect job for Robert Kennedy would be to be CIA director.
[02:22:50.625 --> 02:22:51.165]  I agree.
[02:22:51.225 --> 02:23:05.574]  He could get to the bottom who killed his uncle and his father, and he can get to the bottom who really tried to kill Donald Trump, and he can help prevent another Russian collusion hoax, although this one might be the Iranian collusion hoax.
[02:23:05.954 --> 02:23:06.715]  In this election.
[02:23:06.775 --> 02:23:12.659]  Alex, has Trump, from your understanding, has he taken his security precautions more seriously?
[02:23:12.679 --> 02:23:15.761]  I mean, there's no way he can trust the Secret Service at this junction.
[02:23:15.801 --> 02:23:18.082]  Do you know if he's actually supplemented with private security?
[02:23:18.282 --> 02:23:26.068]  Roger knows as much about this as I do, and let me answer that really good question in a moment, but I wanted to back up what you were saying three minutes ago about them killing his father and uncle.
[02:23:26.548 --> 02:23:34.353]  They've also refused him, even though there's been people coming to try to kill him, RFK Jr., they refused him any Secret Service protection.
[02:23:34.373 --> 02:23:35.214]  So that's Mayorkas,
[02:23:36.014 --> 02:23:46.981]  Doing this yet again, but yes, I know that whenever I was up at TPUSA Action, just a few weeks before they shot Trump, I graced him and I got to meet with J.D.
[02:23:47.082 --> 02:23:48.603]  Vance and he was like, yeah, no, I got it.
[02:23:48.863 --> 02:23:49.943]  He didn't even tell me how to say that.
[02:23:49.983 --> 02:23:50.644]  He just trusts me so much.
[02:23:50.664 --> 02:23:51.224]  Such a cool guy.
[02:23:51.244 --> 02:23:52.945]  I said, I hear you're probably the guy.
[02:23:52.965 --> 02:23:53.626]  He goes, yeah, I got it.
[02:23:54.446 --> 02:23:56.328]  And I talked to him and his chief of staff for a while.
[02:23:57.288 --> 02:24:00.050]  And right there I said, you know, you've got to take on the intel agencies.
[02:24:00.130 --> 02:24:03.052]  And we discussed that and said, yeah, we're going to build a team to do that.
[02:24:03.072 --> 02:24:04.253]  We don't want to talk to you about it.
[02:24:06.094 --> 02:24:26.106]  Right after they shot Trump, I also called some of those contacts and they said, I actually talked to the guy that was their main security guy, I'll just stop there, and they said, yeah, we're bringing in JSOC, Orange Team, former Delta Force people, and augmenting the situation because Trump doesn't trust the leadership of the Secret Service.
[02:24:26.386 --> 02:24:34.891]  He likes to rank and file people, but Trump does now have high-level former Delta Force Pentagon contractors and Navy SEALs protecting him.
[02:24:35.882 --> 02:24:36.442]  Fantastic.
[02:24:37.003 --> 02:24:48.810]  I mean, it's really, it's obviously life or death at this point, but I think if you're looking at the betting odds, the betting markets, Trump has, every time Kamala Harris speaks, she goes down in the polls.
[02:24:48.890 --> 02:24:52.753]  So I think that her speaking tonight, it's expected it should help her.
[02:24:53.013 --> 02:24:54.194]  I think it goes the opposite direction.
[02:24:54.434 --> 02:24:56.316]  Then you wake up tomorrow morning, you have RFK Jr.
[02:24:56.336 --> 02:25:05.605]  that drops out and endorses Trump while simultaneously condemning the DNC for being the most evil, corrupt institution on earth.
[02:25:06.245 --> 02:25:09.668]  It's so damning for them in terms of electoral chances.
[02:25:09.729 --> 02:25:12.811]  I just think it skyrockets the chances that they take another shot at it.
[02:25:12.851 --> 02:25:14.033]  Her poll numbers went down.
[02:25:14.073 --> 02:25:19.538]  This is the first time during the DNC that the poll numbers of the candidate that they're trying to push forward for everyone actually
[02:25:19.898 --> 02:25:20.258]  Lowered.
[02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:30.384]  So they're going to be in full panic mode after this one, especially after RFK makes that announcement with Donald Trump tomorrow, which is going to change the game dramatically.
[02:25:30.444 --> 02:25:38.049]  Well, and they're banking very heavily on her scripted teleprompter speech tonight because she can't speak extemporaneously.
[02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:38.629]  That's clear.
[02:25:38.889 --> 02:25:40.710]  She can't even answer basic questions.
[02:25:40.991 --> 02:25:45.693]  She could never do a full-blown press conference as Donald Trump recently did at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:25:46.074 --> 02:25:48.235]  She could never do a one-on-one interview.
[02:25:48.615 --> 02:25:50.296]  With any serious journalist.
[02:25:50.636 --> 02:25:54.198]  So they're banking heavily on the canned version of her tonight.
[02:25:54.498 --> 02:25:57.280]  This is their attempt to define her.
[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:07.946]  And all the wind gets taken out of that sail, of those sails, tomorrow if RFK, as you've reported Alex, does in fact, as I believe now is likely, endorse Donald Trump.
[02:26:08.046 --> 02:26:10.547]  But we'll just back to what all three or all four of you just said.
[02:26:10.607 --> 02:26:11.968]  And I want to hear what the ladies have to say as well.
[02:26:11.988 --> 02:26:13.889]  I don't want to hog things here, but there's so many great points.
[02:26:15.109 --> 02:26:21.173]  I've been covering this Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and now Thursday night pure torture, but we do get a lot of great clips of the insane lies and things they say.
[02:26:21.273 --> 02:26:23.214]  So we watch it so other people don't have to.
[02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:30.039]  So a lot of folks are tuning into our coverage of it, your coverage, but what's really getting covered is our clips and our quick analysis.
[02:26:30.079 --> 02:26:31.320]  And I've seen yours out there as well.
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:34.042]  So this has been valuable, even though it's been like
[02:26:34.702 --> 02:26:45.109]  You know, a visual and auditory version of nails on a chalkboard, but she popped like an eel out of a hole Monday and Tuesday night, both times for less than 90 seconds.
[02:26:45.649 --> 02:26:50.392]  Reading huge giant teleprompters like she was seven years old and look like a deer in the headlights.
[02:26:50.432 --> 02:26:51.513]  So I think
[02:26:53.154 --> 02:26:58.917]  I would imagine, and I agree with your guest host, this is going to drive her down even more when people see what an empty suit she is.
[02:26:58.937 --> 02:27:03.501]  She's reportedly, from high level sources we've got, for decades been on Xanax and vodka.
[02:27:03.861 --> 02:27:04.781]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[02:27:04.821 --> 02:27:06.883]  I don't ever take Xanax, but I've drank vodka in my time.
[02:27:07.323 --> 02:27:11.186]  But she reportedly is a complete drunk and cannot handle stress.
[02:27:11.906 --> 02:27:13.287]  And so maybe they've controlled her tonight.
[02:27:13.307 --> 02:27:14.288]  Maybe she won't be drunk.
[02:27:14.608 --> 02:27:17.690]  Maybe she won't be on Xanax, but she's reportedly got so much anxiety.
[02:27:18.310 --> 02:27:19.411]  That's why she does it.
[02:27:19.451 --> 02:27:21.533]  So I'm predicting a train wreck.
[02:27:21.553 --> 02:27:22.153]  What do you guys think?
[02:27:22.913 --> 02:27:30.755]  Well, if you look at her kind of behavior, you look at her kind of cackling and laughing inappropriately at different things, it does highlight someone who is dealing with anxiety.
[02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:34.516]  And if you're going to be putting in a puppet, you want someone that you could kind of control.
[02:27:34.536 --> 02:27:40.198]  And I think she's there because of her hard work that she has done getting there through, of course, Willie Brown and other people.
[02:27:40.498 --> 02:27:46.142]  But more importantly, she's also someone that the establishment sees as someone that they could manipulate, that they could play with.
[02:27:46.502 --> 02:27:52.066]  She's probably hopped up on a lot of pharmaceuticals just like Joe Biden was, and I think they're trying to get the formula right.
[02:27:52.126 --> 02:27:56.649]  I think she's getting the best training, PR marketing training in the world right now.
[02:27:56.689 --> 02:27:59.471]  The same people that trained the Obamas are probably training her.
[02:27:59.771 --> 02:28:10.378]  She was nowhere to be seen last night during the VP kind of speech that was given, and I think that's because she is absolutely not going to become favorable
[02:28:10.498 --> 02:28:13.839]  She was not in her hotel room, like they said.
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:16.400]  She was in a ballroom somewhere practicing.
[02:28:17.301 --> 02:28:17.721]  Exactly.
[02:28:17.781 --> 02:28:23.904]  And they're making sure that this is the most important moment of her life, so they're trying to make sure that they get it right.
[02:28:23.944 --> 02:28:30.786]  They're going to make sure that she tries to come off as good as she can to the American public, but she's no Big Mike.
[02:28:30.826 --> 02:28:32.107]  She's no Michelle Obama.
[02:28:32.167 --> 02:28:37.329]  She's not the same kind of human being that's been primed for that very specific position.
[02:28:37.509 --> 02:28:38.109]  I totally agree.
[02:28:38.370 --> 02:28:40.271]  Michelle Obama had everyone going crazy.
[02:28:40.531 --> 02:28:45.413]  It was like they were seeing God in front on the stage when Michelle Obama was speaking.
[02:28:45.714 --> 02:28:47.515]  We're not going to get that with Kamala Harris.
[02:28:47.575 --> 02:28:48.515]  She's not favorable.
[02:28:48.815 --> 02:28:50.396]  She doesn't know how to deal with large crowds.
[02:28:50.636 --> 02:28:54.498]  As you said, she has a large history of anxiety, probably substance abuse.
[02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:55.399]  A lot of these D.C.
[02:28:55.439 --> 02:29:00.562]  people use a lot of drugs, and it wouldn't surprise me if she stopped on them, and that's where they got the compromise.
[02:29:00.582 --> 02:29:05.685]  I don't want to give away sources here, but when I was in California for a week covering Bohemian Grove,
[02:29:07.045 --> 02:29:07.886]  I know a lady.
[02:29:08.246 --> 02:29:09.386]  Let's just leave it at that.
[02:29:09.446 --> 02:29:13.048]  That's a friend of the family that came by to visit us for dinner, and she's on record.
[02:29:13.128 --> 02:29:14.149]  She has photos on her phone.
[02:29:14.589 --> 02:29:18.371]  She worked for the governor, and when he was mayor, she knows Kamala.
[02:29:18.471 --> 02:29:21.612]  And she's gotten drunk, and she's partied with these people.
[02:29:22.793 --> 02:29:25.054]  And she told me, she said, no, she pops.
[02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.591]  We're good.
[02:29:26.611 --> 02:29:27.151]  We're good.
[02:29:27.171 --> 02:29:27.511]  We're good.
[02:29:27.571 --> 02:29:28.713]  We're good.
[02:29:28.733 --> 02:29:29.133]  We're good.
[02:30:11.801 --> 02:30:13.442]  We're all getting the reflected glory through her.
[02:30:13.462 --> 02:30:16.483]  It's like a clown she's so fake.
[02:30:16.523 --> 02:30:19.445]  Good evening!
[02:30:23.166 --> 02:30:24.247]  Get a little cackle going.
[02:30:25.888 --> 02:30:26.908]  The cackle of the grackle.
[02:30:39.854 --> 02:30:40.835]  Look at those train seals.
[02:30:45.441 --> 02:30:46.221]  They are so desperate.
[02:30:47.342 --> 02:30:48.163]  They're gonna try to kill Trump.
[02:30:48.783 --> 02:30:52.385]  They're gonna try to steal it, but RFK is gonna put a hole in their operation.
[02:30:54.666 --> 02:30:55.406]  I mean, look at this.
[02:30:55.447 --> 02:30:56.307]  This is disgusting.
[02:30:58.428 --> 02:30:59.309]  Good evening!
[02:30:59.329 --> 02:31:00.509]  Total communist, total tyrant.
[02:31:00.529 --> 02:31:01.850]  Good evening!
[02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:07.213]  Good evening!
[02:31:07.233 --> 02:31:07.473]  Oh my God.
[02:31:07.493 --> 02:31:08.774]  Look at this coot.
[02:31:08.834 --> 02:31:09.314]  Oh my goodness.
[02:31:15.896 --> 02:31:17.637]  This political class loves being on TV.
[02:31:17.657 --> 02:31:18.138]  They're movie stars.
[02:31:18.158 --> 02:31:20.019]  Good evening.
[02:31:20.719 --> 02:31:21.320]  Thank you.
[02:31:22.641 --> 02:31:22.941]  Thank you.
[02:31:23.061 --> 02:31:23.741]  Thank you.

[02:31:40.392 --> 02:31:41.333]  This is a war.
[02:31:41.833 --> 02:31:43.134]  They come after us, but we're willing to do it.
[02:31:43.174 --> 02:31:43.895]  We need your help, though.

[02:32:01.405 --> 02:32:02.146]  I've seen it myself.
[02:32:02.166 --> 02:32:03.646]  They're pulling down our monuments.
[02:32:04.067 --> 02:32:06.408]  They have a chant USA to fool Americans watching.
[02:32:08.449 --> 02:32:09.489]  We gotta get to some business.
[02:32:10.570 --> 02:32:11.270]  So shut up!
[02:32:13.271 --> 02:32:13.651]  Thank you.
[02:32:13.731 --> 02:32:14.151]  Thank you.
[02:32:14.231 --> 02:32:14.632]  Thank you.
[02:32:14.712 --> 02:32:15.192]  Thank you.
[02:32:15.232 --> 02:32:16.212]  Now she's turning to Joe Biden.
[02:32:16.252 --> 02:32:16.792]  Thank you.
[02:32:16.912 --> 02:32:17.352]  Please.
[02:32:17.512 --> 02:32:18.153]  Thank you.
[02:32:18.293 --> 02:32:18.653]  Please.
[02:32:18.793 --> 02:32:20.093]  Thank you so very much.
[02:32:20.113 --> 02:32:21.274]  Rosardi's super cringe.
[02:32:21.414 --> 02:32:22.534]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:32:22.694 --> 02:32:23.875]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:32:24.015 --> 02:32:24.855]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.315]  OK, let's get to business.
[02:32:26.375 --> 02:32:27.076]  Let's get to business.
[02:32:27.096 --> 02:32:27.816]  She can't handle it.
[02:32:27.996 --> 02:32:28.376]  All right.
[02:32:28.896 --> 02:32:29.196]  We'll see.
[02:32:29.236 --> 02:32:30.217]  It's great to be here.
[02:32:30.317 --> 02:32:31.497]  Yeah, you're awesome.
[02:32:31.577 --> 02:32:32.557]  All right, thank you.
[02:32:32.577 --> 02:32:37.299]  Let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug.
[02:32:37.319 --> 02:32:39.800]  Another crook like me.
[02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:49.087]  For being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella, and happy anniversary, Dougie.
[02:32:52.810 --> 02:32:54.412]  I love you so very much.
[02:32:54.552 --> 02:32:55.272]  Look at these kids.
[02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:58.235]  To our president, Joe Biden.
[02:33:03.394 --> 02:33:10.377]  When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude.
[02:33:10.857 --> 02:33:18.000]  Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring.
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:18.620]  His character.
[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:22.202]  And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you.
[02:33:22.222 --> 02:33:24.103]  Remember, she wasn't the Mortar Czar the last three weeks.
[02:33:24.143 --> 02:33:26.123]  Now she's the Great Mortar Czar, they said last night.
[02:33:28.224 --> 02:33:29.445]  Senators, sheriffs, all of them.
[02:33:29.485 --> 02:33:30.305]  Oh, she's incredible.
[02:33:30.385 --> 02:33:31.866]  And to Coach Tim Walz,
[02:33:32.745 --> 02:33:34.466]  Oh, the coach, he's not a Chinese communist agent.
[02:33:34.526 --> 02:33:36.266]  He's not Tampon Tim.
[02:33:37.747 --> 02:33:41.068]  You are going to be an incredible vice president!
[02:33:41.248 --> 02:33:41.688]  Oh, yeah.
[02:33:41.948 --> 02:33:43.168]  Chi-Com agent, literally.
[02:33:44.749 --> 02:33:46.129]  They intend to deal the death blow to this country.
[02:33:46.149 --> 02:33:53.971]  And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling.
[02:33:55.152 --> 02:34:02.074]  So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected.
[02:34:03.527 --> 02:34:06.571]  But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.
[02:34:07.612 --> 02:34:12.597]  So, my mother, our mother, Shamala Harris, had one of her own.
[02:34:13.358 --> 02:34:16.702]  And I miss her every day, and especially right now.
[02:34:17.984 --> 02:34:19.826]  And I know she's looking down, smiling.
[02:34:19.966 --> 02:34:22.068]  So all it is is nostalgia for dead people.
[02:34:22.989 --> 02:34:23.590]  Every speaker does this.
[02:34:23.610 --> 02:34:24.051]  I know that.
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:39.679]  So my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:42.000]  Well, take the glyphosate out of things.
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:42.801]  That'll cure most of it.
[02:34:42.841 --> 02:34:48.342]  When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage.
[02:34:48.362 --> 02:34:50.823]  These are the same people that put the fluoride in the water to brain damage you.
[02:34:50.963 --> 02:34:52.263]  AP Mainstream News.
[02:34:52.703 --> 02:34:53.544]  Massive IQ reduction.
[02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:54.484]  Put that on screen, guys.
[02:34:54.844 --> 02:34:55.604]  AP.
[02:34:56.124 --> 02:34:58.265]  Massive IQ reduction in children from fluoride.
[02:34:58.285 --> 02:35:06.047]  They fell in love and got married and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me.
[02:35:11.155 --> 02:35:13.137]  Growing up, we moved a lot.
[02:35:13.157 --> 02:35:13.997]  They say high levels.
[02:35:14.017 --> 02:35:16.539]  I will always remember that big Mayflower truck.
[02:35:16.579 --> 02:35:16.779]  The U.S.
[02:35:16.819 --> 02:35:19.582]  puts four times, almost four times what they say is safe.
[02:35:19.782 --> 02:35:21.183]  To Illinois.
[02:35:21.783 --> 02:35:23.344]  When they say double, it's almost four times.
[02:35:23.385 --> 02:35:23.745]  To Wisconsin.
[02:35:26.727 --> 02:35:29.429]  And wherever our parents' jobs took us.
[02:35:30.490 --> 02:35:35.234]  My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones.
[02:35:35.974 --> 02:35:38.776]  A home filled with laughter and music.
[02:35:39.704 --> 02:35:51.150]  Wow, nothing about the economy, nothing about the open border, nothing about inflation, nothing about World War III.
[02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:53.451]  Just all, my mama, my daddy, my mama, my daddy.
[02:36:03.592 --> 02:36:04.092]  My mom and my daddy.
[02:36:04.152 --> 02:36:05.113]  My mom and my daddy.
[02:36:05.133 --> 02:36:06.914]  Because your dad was a communist.
[02:36:06.934 --> 02:36:08.214]  Admitted communist to the professor.
[02:36:29.292 --> 02:36:33.856]  We either lived in the hills or the flatlands.
[02:36:34.356 --> 02:36:35.698]  We lived in the flats.
[02:36:36.718 --> 02:36:43.544]  A beautiful, working class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers.
[02:36:43.564 --> 02:36:45.886]  All who tended their lawns with pride.
[02:36:50.911 --> 02:36:52.253]  Wow, this is unwatchable.
[02:37:06.272 --> 02:37:09.635]  Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddy.
[02:37:09.795 --> 02:37:11.797]  Let's see if Roger Stone can hear me.
[02:37:11.817 --> 02:37:14.860]  They're probably not taking my feed, but let me see if Roger wants to pop in here.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:16.081]  No substance at all.
[02:37:16.141 --> 02:37:18.142]  Just a total empty, ugly suit.
[02:37:18.703 --> 02:37:19.063]  Yeah, guys.
[02:37:19.083 --> 02:37:19.644]  Where's the beef?
[02:37:20.645 --> 02:37:26.890]  We're five minutes into this and she's yet to begin to tell us what she stands for, what she's going to do.
[02:37:27.491 --> 02:37:30.573]  She did praise Joe Biden's record as historic and great.
[02:37:31.953 --> 02:37:34.075]  Which is an absurdity in itself.
[02:37:34.175 --> 02:37:36.257]  But this is really vapid.
[02:37:36.738 --> 02:37:37.478]  Very much like her.
[02:37:37.759 --> 02:37:38.179]  Vapid.
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:41.402]  Who do you think wrote this?
[02:37:41.422 --> 02:37:44.805]  Guys, who do you think wrote this monstrosity?
[02:37:44.825 --> 02:37:45.966]  And what's the tactic, Roger?
[02:37:46.646 --> 02:37:46.867]  Luke?
[02:37:47.785 --> 02:37:52.810]  I think they're trying to pander culturally to the black vote right now and that's why they're talking about all these kind of cultural motives there.
[02:37:53.730 --> 02:37:55.772]  So, Badia Benjamin probably wrote this?
[02:37:56.032 --> 02:38:00.156]  Yeah, her Indian mother was just constantly listening to Aretha Franklin.
[02:38:00.176 --> 02:38:03.259]  If you buy that, you'll definitely be voting for Kamala.
[02:38:03.419 --> 02:38:08.522]  This is very much like the 2008 Obama campaign, where they sell a vibe.
[02:38:08.942 --> 02:38:10.223]  They don't sell specifics.
[02:38:10.623 --> 02:38:11.384]  It's about hope.
[02:38:12.184 --> 02:38:13.325]  Now it's about joy.
[02:38:13.625 --> 02:38:17.227]  I'm not feeling too joyful watching this, but it's now about joy.
[02:38:17.768 --> 02:38:28.534]  We won't get into the specifics of how we're going to confiscate their property, or how we're going to charge you a capital gains tax on gains that don't really exist.
[02:38:28.934 --> 02:38:30.515]  No, we won't talk about any of those things.
[02:38:30.535 --> 02:38:31.836]  Celebritary doom culture.
[02:38:33.476 --> 02:38:39.382]  We're now six, seven minutes into this, guys, and we can see the closed captioning.
[02:38:39.482 --> 02:38:42.825]  It's all about her mother, still.
[02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:44.727]  This is dodging reality here.
[02:38:49.272 --> 02:38:49.952]  Do something about it.
[02:38:49.972 --> 02:38:51.154]  You've been in power for four years.
[02:38:51.174 --> 02:38:52.295]  That was my mother.
[02:38:52.855 --> 02:38:53.416]  That's been the theme.
[02:38:53.476 --> 02:38:54.097]  Do something!
[02:38:56.476 --> 02:39:00.043]  She puts her pants on one leg at a time and then her lizard tail.
[02:39:00.825 --> 02:39:04.933]  And that is a direct quote!
[02:39:06.937 --> 02:39:08.500]  Alright, that's seven minutes on Mama.
[02:39:11.869 --> 02:39:15.134]  I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement.
[02:39:15.754 --> 02:39:29.072]  My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley.
[02:39:30.922 --> 02:39:36.406]  Those who battled in the courtroom to make real promises of America.
[02:39:37.307 --> 02:39:41.029]  So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work.
[02:39:41.390 --> 02:39:42.550]  I wanted to be a lawyer.
[02:39:43.311 --> 02:39:51.257]  And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life.
[02:39:52.678 --> 02:39:57.661]  You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda.
[02:39:58.937 --> 02:40:00.297]  She was sad at school.
[02:40:01.438 --> 02:40:03.878]  And there were times she didn't want to go home.
[02:40:05.258 --> 02:40:07.839]  So one day I asked if everything was alright.
[02:40:08.659 --> 02:40:13.060]  And she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.001]  And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us.
[02:40:17.681 --> 02:40:18.201]  And she did.
[02:40:19.521 --> 02:40:23.062]  This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor.
[02:40:23.082 --> 02:40:27.003]  And that's why you opened the border up for hundreds of thousands of children to be sex trafficked?
[02:40:28.328 --> 02:40:32.410]  As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of the people.
[02:40:32.430 --> 02:40:32.850]  For a simple reason.
[02:40:53.829 --> 02:41:01.832]  In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.
[02:41:03.813 --> 02:41:18.139]  And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone.
[02:41:18.839 --> 02:41:21.680]  We are all in this together.
[02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:23.341]  What about the trafficked children at record levels?
[02:41:24.841 --> 02:41:27.523]  She literally oversees it.
[02:41:27.543 --> 02:41:33.628]  In the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge, and I said five words.
[02:41:34.869 --> 02:41:36.950]  Kamala Harris for the people.
[02:41:36.970 --> 02:41:40.973]  She's a vicious prosecutor.
[02:41:41.494 --> 02:41:45.216]  Famous for putting blacks in jail for nonviolent crimes.
[02:41:45.717 --> 02:41:48.419]  Now she lets Antifa out for killing people.
[02:41:48.799 --> 02:41:52.202]  I've only had one client, the people.
[02:41:55.202 --> 02:41:56.763]  Famous people on death row found to be innocent.
[02:41:56.783 --> 02:42:11.748]  And so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless... And when she knew that that particular black man who endorsed Trump was innocent, she fought to keep him in jail.
[02:42:11.808 --> 02:42:13.428]  She's a pig.
[02:42:14.069 --> 02:42:23.432]  On behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey,
[02:42:24.855 --> 02:42:35.784]  On behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another.
[02:42:35.804 --> 02:42:37.465]  In Canada, where she grew up.
[02:42:37.485 --> 02:42:46.713]  On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth.
[02:42:48.314 --> 02:42:50.396]  I accept your nomination.
[02:42:50.436 --> 02:42:52.558]  That's why the left tells us all day how bad America is.
[02:42:56.303 --> 02:42:56.703]  Is that it?
[02:42:56.723 --> 02:43:00.666]  That can't be it.
[02:43:00.686 --> 02:43:04.069]  She accepts their nomination after no one democratically voted for her.
[02:43:04.129 --> 02:43:06.631]  Awesome.
[02:43:06.731 --> 02:43:09.713]  I mean, look at Patrick Bateman there.
[02:43:13.956 --> 02:43:15.757]  It's like a Rob Zombie movie.
[02:43:15.817 --> 02:43:24.204]  And with this election, our nation, our nation with this election has a precious
[02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:35.489]  Fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past.
[02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:40.272]  A chance to chart a new way forward.
[02:43:44.901 --> 02:43:50.606]  Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.
[02:43:50.906 --> 02:43:55.109]  See, all their surrogates create division, and then they call for unity at this, and order them to hold up USA signs.
[02:43:55.129 --> 02:43:57.531]  Roger Stone, would you call this a pretty bad dud right now?
[02:43:57.551 --> 02:43:58.552]  That's what I say.
[02:44:09.078 --> 02:44:11.499]  You know, this is supposed to be uplifting and visionary.
[02:44:11.559 --> 02:44:15.301]  This is her opportunity to tell people what she would do for the country.
[02:44:15.381 --> 02:44:20.304]  We're still on her biography and it's largely falsified.
[02:44:20.324 --> 02:44:22.325]  I mean, she wasn't a tough prosecutor.
[02:44:22.685 --> 02:44:28.288]  The only people she was tough on were those poor bastards who were caught with small amounts of marijuana.
[02:44:28.868 --> 02:44:33.410]  In their case, a first-time non-violent crime for which she gave them the max.
[02:44:33.831 --> 02:44:34.231]  That's right.
[02:44:34.251 --> 02:44:36.492]  So, everything about this woman is a fraud.
[02:44:38.547 --> 02:44:40.768]  Yeah, this is even less impressive than I thought.
[02:44:40.808 --> 02:44:46.890]  I mean, I know Obama did this too in 2008, as you said, but this is literally narcissism.
[02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:57.874]  I mean, imagine if Trump got up there and didn't even hardly talk about himself at his nomination speech in Milwaukee, and this has been 90% about her, nothing about the country.
[02:44:58.675 --> 02:45:00.515]  Oh, she rhymed!
[02:45:00.535 --> 02:45:00.975]  Oh, how smart!
[02:45:06.869 --> 02:45:18.131]  As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them.
[02:45:18.951 --> 02:45:22.572]  As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks.
[02:45:22.972 --> 02:45:29.853]  And she put pro-libers that exposed them selling baby parts illegally in prison.
[02:45:30.153 --> 02:45:36.034]  And helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation.
[02:45:37.958 --> 02:45:41.280]  I remember when she tried to put parents in jail for truancy of their kids.
[02:45:41.881 --> 02:45:43.782]  That's right.
[02:45:43.842 --> 02:45:45.403]  She would throw people in jail.
[02:45:45.443 --> 02:45:46.644]  She started that nationwide.
[02:45:46.964 --> 02:45:48.566]  Throwing parents in jail while their kid was trying.
[02:45:49.126 --> 02:45:50.907]  I wonder if that's for women.
[02:45:50.927 --> 02:45:53.269]  Elaborate on that.
[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:55.791]  She's for the women.
[02:45:56.091 --> 02:45:58.933]  And she's putting women in jail for their kids not going to school.
[02:45:58.993 --> 02:46:00.474]  I mean, how is that being for women?
[02:46:00.774 --> 02:46:01.535]  She pioneered it.
[02:46:02.489 --> 02:46:10.071]  I mean, listen, I've known her 30 years.
[02:46:11.351 --> 02:46:16.733]  I've been on her 30 years, and I didn't cover California that much.
[02:46:16.813 --> 02:46:18.893]  I've been covering her for at least 20 years.
[02:46:19.514 --> 02:46:21.714]  She has stood out as a police state thug that long.
[02:46:22.214 --> 02:46:26.015]  Then she flip-flops and lets violent people that burn cities down out of jail.
[02:46:26.075 --> 02:46:28.316]  I mean, she raised money to bail them out.
[02:46:30.387 --> 02:46:32.628]  It's about the first 37 years of my life in California.
[02:46:33.109 --> 02:46:39.673]  She, along with Gavin Newsom, absolutely destroyed the most beautiful state, if not just in America, but maybe on the planet.
[02:46:40.193 --> 02:46:41.354]  These people are absolutely evil.
[02:46:41.394 --> 02:46:47.658]  The fact that they continue to skyrocket within the Democrat apparatus is just indicative of how disgusting the entire operation is.
[02:46:47.678 --> 02:46:49.579]  And now they're going to turn America into California.
[02:46:49.599 --> 02:46:51.100]  They're going to follow the same blueprint.
[02:46:51.741 --> 02:46:52.041]  They are.
[02:46:52.061 --> 02:46:53.021]  I agree with you.
[02:46:53.061 --> 02:47:00.143]  California's the most beautiful state in the U.S., one of the most beautiful places in the world, especially central northern, and they have run it into the ground.
[02:47:01.103 --> 02:47:15.807]  But you see right here graphically why Barack Obama himself had serious reservations about her ability to win, why he's now imposed his three top people on her campaign to try to get control of it.
[02:47:16.707 --> 02:47:20.731]  That's going to cause natural friction with the old Kamala staff.
[02:47:20.971 --> 02:47:22.292]  I think that's already beginning.
[02:47:23.132 --> 02:47:28.116]  And their real problem is, how can we hide her for the next 70 plus days?
[02:47:28.577 --> 02:47:31.699]  Because this kind of exposure will lose her votes.
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:39.005]  If this was going to be her big triumphant moment, she gets no pop out of the polls at all with this.
[02:47:40.706 --> 02:47:42.368]  How big a pop do you think we get off the Kennedy?
[02:47:42.688 --> 02:47:43.949]  I think it's how much coverage it gets.
[02:47:44.349 --> 02:47:48.393]  It's getting massive coverage even in mainstream media, but particularly independent media.
[02:47:49.314 --> 02:47:56.220]  Yeah, six to eight points easily, and it also bridges the gap with a lot of people who are skeptical of the vaccine issue with Donald Trump.
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:59.483]  That's going to be, of course, reassured to them with RFK in there.
[02:47:59.523 --> 02:48:07.050]  That's going to, of course, probably do the right thing on that particular issue and safeguard a lot of individuals to now actually be behind Donald Trump that were skeptical.
[02:48:09.698 --> 02:48:10.378]  And send help.
[02:48:10.819 --> 02:48:12.339]  He did the opposite.
[02:48:12.879 --> 02:48:14.700]  He fanned the flames.
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:15.180]  No he didn't.
[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:15.980]  He's not been charged.
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:16.541]  That's not true.
[02:48:16.561 --> 02:48:17.041]  And now.
[02:48:17.561 --> 02:48:17.981]  January 6th.
[02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:21.022]  An entirely different set of crimes.
[02:48:21.342 --> 02:48:25.204]  He was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans.
[02:48:25.224 --> 02:48:25.824]  Oh yeah right.
[02:48:26.724 --> 02:48:27.785]  Totally right.
[02:48:29.565 --> 02:48:33.807]  And separately found liable for committing sexual abuse.
[02:48:33.947 --> 02:48:34.447]  Yeah right.
[02:48:36.007 --> 02:48:37.108]  You're the sexual abuser.
[02:48:37.508 --> 02:48:39.869]  You're the trafficker of children, the biggest ever with the Americans.
[02:48:40.069 --> 02:48:51.434]  I mean, the great irony is the Democrats in New York passed a special bill to extend the period in which one can charge another person with sexual assault.
[02:48:51.454 --> 02:48:52.234]  And who gets nailed?
[02:48:52.815 --> 02:48:59.197]  Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams both get charged by women who come forward and accuse them of assault.
[02:48:59.618 --> 02:49:01.518]  Talk about unintended consequences.
[02:49:01.959 --> 02:49:04.720]  And also, what if the state senator that wrote the bill, he got hit with it?
[02:49:05.740 --> 02:49:06.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:09.521 --> 02:49:14.422]  All of that, by the way, was orchestrated by Kellyanne Conway's ex-husband, George Conway.
[02:49:15.002 --> 02:49:25.124]  He is the evil genius behind that whole effort to have the state legislature set the new parameters under which one could be charged without the statute of limitations having run.
[02:49:25.264 --> 02:49:32.465]  Well, I don't remember when it was, 25 years ago, Roger, but I was in that area too with the open dressing rooms and Donald Trump
[02:49:34.441 --> 02:49:39.084]  Donald Trump put his pee-pee in me there too.
[02:49:41.606 --> 02:49:49.213]  And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States.
[02:49:50.532 --> 02:49:52.855]  Not to improve your life.
[02:49:53.275 --> 02:49:54.217]  Oh, they're doing it again.
[02:49:54.497 --> 02:49:57.861]  Trump's going to come after us with weaponized Justice Department, Roger.
[02:49:58.001 --> 02:49:58.822]  You've experienced that.
[02:49:58.842 --> 02:49:59.623]  I've experienced it.
[02:49:59.683 --> 02:50:01.165]  How big a load of horseman-er is this?
[02:50:07.692 --> 02:50:09.815]  This idea that Trump is running for himself.
[02:50:09.835 --> 02:50:14.442]  If Trump were in this for himself, he would have ridden off into the sunset long ago.
[02:50:15.343 --> 02:50:18.447]  They have cost him billions and billions of dollars.
[02:50:18.487 --> 02:50:20.310]  They tried to bankrupt him.
[02:50:20.650 --> 02:50:21.932]  They tried to incarcerate him.
[02:50:21.952 --> 02:50:22.793]  They're still trying.
[02:50:23.034 --> 02:50:24.015]  They tried to kill him.
[02:50:24.856 --> 02:50:29.098]  Clearly, if he were only in this for himself, he would just walk away.
[02:50:29.118 --> 02:50:29.518]  Well, that's right.
[02:50:29.558 --> 02:50:30.538]  He's self-made.
[02:50:30.558 --> 02:50:32.159]  He's self-made, unlike them.
[02:50:32.579 --> 02:50:35.620]  Then they claim because his dad was wealthy, that's where he got it.
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:39.281]  He made 50 times the money his dad ever did and was the star of the family.
[02:50:39.781 --> 02:50:41.882]  And it's like saying Elon Musk isn't a maverick.
[02:50:42.122 --> 02:50:42.982]  Look what he's done now.
[02:50:43.002 --> 02:50:44.503]  It's like saying Trump isn't a maverick.
[02:50:44.563 --> 02:50:45.683]  No, he's a maverick.
[02:50:46.683 --> 02:50:49.424]  And they want people to forget they tried to kill him and he stood up and said, fight, fight, fight.
[02:50:49.724 --> 02:50:51.105]  No one's ever going to forget that.
[02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:58.391]  When insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions.
[02:50:58.411 --> 02:51:00.092]  Oh my God, Obamacare was the biggest screw job ever.
[02:51:00.132 --> 02:51:05.555]  We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools.
[02:51:05.575 --> 02:51:06.716]  Does it fund the public schools?
[02:51:06.776 --> 02:51:07.416]  It steals the state money.
[02:51:07.436 --> 02:51:08.537]  It doesn't fund the public schools.
[02:51:08.677 --> 02:51:14.700]  We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide peaceful environment for our children.
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:16.121]  America, we are not going back.
[02:51:20.063 --> 02:51:25.068]  Well, when they interviewed him yesterday, they seemed to fail to ask him about knocking up the nanny.
[02:51:25.588 --> 02:51:27.490]  How did that not get into the interview?
[02:51:28.311 --> 02:51:28.631]  Dougie.
[02:51:33.086 --> 02:51:37.409]  And look how desperate and sad the constituency looks in the crowd.
[02:51:37.449 --> 02:51:44.112]  I mean, I'm sorry, they look like hopeless zombies.
[02:51:44.192 --> 02:51:55.599]  We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.
[02:51:55.639 --> 02:51:57.800]  Will be, you've been in power for four years, you stupid witch.
[02:51:59.056 --> 02:52:01.177]  What about that, Roger?
[02:52:01.297 --> 02:52:04.218]  And I'll tell you, this is personal for me.
[02:52:04.979 --> 02:52:07.340]  The middle class is where I come from.
[02:52:08.541 --> 02:52:10.341]  My mother kept a strict budget.
[02:52:11.282 --> 02:52:13.043]  We lived within our means.
[02:52:13.743 --> 02:52:14.683]  Yet, we wanted for little.
[02:52:16.727 --> 02:52:22.130]  And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us.
[02:52:22.851 --> 02:52:24.552]  And to be grateful for them.
[02:52:25.432 --> 02:52:31.036]  Because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone.
[02:52:31.116 --> 02:52:32.117]  Oh, here goes the communism.
[02:52:32.317 --> 02:52:36.679]  That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy.
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:45.365]  An opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed.
[02:52:45.985 --> 02:52:47.706]  Oh, the government's going to do that.
[02:52:47.826 --> 02:52:50.728]  Unless you're a white guy.
[02:52:50.748 --> 02:53:00.753]  That's why she brought in 20 million illegal aliens and subsidized them.
[02:53:00.773 --> 02:53:05.816]  Did you guys hear California's going to give 0% interest loans only to illegal aliens for homes?
[02:53:07.302 --> 02:53:10.425]  With down payment assistance, it's unbelievable.
[02:53:10.445 --> 02:53:17.672]  I mean, I don't even hate the illegal aliens, but holy Toledo, they're literally bringing in voters and paying them off.
[02:53:17.692 --> 02:53:20.715]  Yep, Oregon is giving $30,000 for new homebuyers.
[02:53:20.755 --> 02:53:23.677]  The only requirement is that you can't be an American citizen.
[02:53:23.918 --> 02:53:25.019]  That's the type of craziness.
[02:53:25.059 --> 02:53:27.981]  Taxpayer funded, just people being bought off.
[02:53:29.523 --> 02:53:30.644]  Total criminal takeover.
[02:53:33.298 --> 02:53:34.639]  That's unconstitutional.
[02:53:34.659 --> 02:53:36.160]  People need to file lawsuits in those states.
[02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:37.121]  That's total discrimination.
[02:53:38.002 --> 02:53:39.183]  Any citizen, black, white, doesn't matter.
[02:53:39.203 --> 02:53:39.603]  This is horse crap.
[02:53:39.643 --> 02:53:41.644]  Oh, that's why he brought so many jobs back.
[02:53:41.664 --> 02:53:46.949]  Oh, that's why 95% of the big corporate donations have gone to the Democrats this cycle against Trump.
[02:53:46.989 --> 02:53:47.129]  Lies!
[02:54:00.691 --> 02:54:06.374]  That's why we had the largest rate of both job growth and wage growth in American history during the Trump years.
[02:54:06.394 --> 02:54:07.235]  Until they hit us with COVID.
[02:54:07.295 --> 02:54:07.855]  Oh, there's a Trump tax!
[02:54:07.875 --> 02:54:09.476]  That's why inflation quadrupled under Biden.
[02:54:31.490 --> 02:54:38.192]  All of the Trump tax cuts were across the board.
[02:54:38.212 --> 02:54:43.893]  This is the same baloney they said about Reagan, same thing they said about JFK, when they both cut taxes.
[02:54:45.014 --> 02:54:48.975]  Is it because they think their constituents are that economically and politically illiterate?
[02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:58.213]  Very clearly, because she's pledging to hire more border security guards and crack down and close our border.
[02:54:59.173 --> 02:55:03.654]  This is almost unbelievable because I thought she was in charge of the border.
[02:55:03.774 --> 02:55:07.836]  Too many women are not able to make those decisions.
[02:55:08.576 --> 02:55:10.817]  And let's be clear about how we got here.
[02:55:11.777 --> 02:55:18.039]  Donald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.
[02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:19.451]  No, he gave it back to the states.
[02:55:19.691 --> 02:55:22.513]  And now he brags about it.
[02:55:23.293 --> 02:55:28.517]  In his words, quote, I did it and I'm proud to have done it, end quote.
[02:55:30.198 --> 02:55:38.944]  Well, I'll tell you, over the past two years, I've traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories.
[02:55:39.705 --> 02:55:41.726]  Husbands and fathers have shared theirs.
[02:55:41.746 --> 02:55:43.007]  Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot.
[02:55:48.171 --> 02:55:50.092]  Instead of being chopped up in a food truck outside.
[02:55:50.112 --> 02:55:50.632]  Developing sepsis.
[02:55:51.032 --> 02:55:54.374]  Losing the ability to ever again have children.
[02:55:55.094 --> 02:56:00.477]  All because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients.
[02:56:00.517 --> 02:56:02.338]  Like Hillary's first client in Arkansas that raped a woman.
[02:56:02.358 --> 02:56:04.119]  Couples just trying to grow their families.
[02:56:04.939 --> 02:56:06.400]  Cut off in the middle of IVF treatment.
[02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:10.542]  The audacity to talk about miscarrying in a car as they literally do abortions in the parking lot is unbelievable.
[02:56:10.562 --> 02:56:11.943]  Children who have survived sexual assault.
[02:56:12.703 --> 02:56:16.625]  Potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term.
[02:56:18.407 --> 02:56:23.049]  This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump.
[02:56:24.310 --> 02:56:26.471]  And understand, he is not done.
[02:56:27.971 --> 02:56:43.799]  As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress.
[02:56:44.399 --> 02:56:45.880]  That is completely false.
[02:56:46.718 --> 02:57:00.168]  Trump said to the states, he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.
[02:57:01.208 --> 02:57:01.488]  What?
[02:57:01.909 --> 02:57:02.969]  This is just made up nonsense.
[02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:06.572]  Simply put, they are out of their minds.
[02:57:06.872 --> 02:57:07.453]  Yeah right.
[02:57:09.194 --> 02:57:09.994]  Talk about projection.
[02:57:10.075 --> 02:57:11.916]  Well you get excited talking about killing babies though.
[02:57:14.892 --> 02:57:17.196]  You know, she practiced this speech probably 20 times, Roger.
[02:57:17.216 --> 02:57:19.199]  50, probably.
[02:57:19.219 --> 02:57:20.622]  It didn't get much better.
[02:57:21.083 --> 02:57:25.150]  Why exactly is it that they don't trust women?
[02:57:26.852 --> 02:57:28.595]  Well, we trust women.
[02:57:30.109 --> 02:57:34.911]  That's when you ran the border with the biggest child trafficking or sex slavery in human history.
[02:57:34.931 --> 02:57:37.692]  To trust women as long as they want to get the vaccine.
[02:57:37.712 --> 02:57:39.792]  Yeah, they're a nurse that doesn't want it, they're fired.
[02:57:39.832 --> 02:57:41.973]  Or a doctor that doesn't want it, they're fired.
[02:57:50.252 --> 02:58:02.355]  What this really tells you is that their polling and their experience in 2022, where they were able to lie about this issue and sell the big lie, is all they really have.
[02:58:02.555 --> 02:58:12.298]  Nothing else works in their polling other than scaring people and saying that Donald Trump wants a national abortion ban, which of course he's very specifically opposed.
[02:58:13.738 --> 02:58:19.521]  Saying that he has a secret plan to end access to all abortions or to end access to birth control.
[02:58:19.681 --> 02:58:25.904]  Yet another seismic lie in terms of the size of her lies tonight.
[02:58:26.765 --> 02:58:29.086]  This whole speech is about her mother and abortion.
[02:58:29.106 --> 02:58:32.187]  I think that's it.
[02:58:32.267 --> 02:58:37.850]  But he also might weaponize the judicial system as he currently faces 800 years in prison.
[02:58:38.130 --> 02:58:39.691]  Against his political enemies, yeah.
[02:58:42.535 --> 02:58:49.099]  You're listening to Simulcast of Info Wars and myself, Alex Jones and Luke Rudowsky, Roger Stone, the rest of his great crew on his show.
[02:58:49.119 --> 02:58:51.801]  Why don't you guys tell people about your show?
[02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:55.063]  Look, the best political show dot com.
[02:58:55.083 --> 02:58:58.325]  We're on rumble right now, and we're also on Twitter at Luke.
[02:58:58.365 --> 02:59:00.466]  We are changed, but we do this three days a week.
[02:59:00.486 --> 02:59:04.509]  We have a lot of great people in here, and we try to break down everything that happens as it happens live.
[02:59:04.589 --> 02:59:08.832]  And, you know, we're very lucky to live next to Roger, and we've been doing a lot of work together.
[02:59:09.352 --> 02:59:09.713]  Wonderful.
[02:59:10.093 --> 02:59:19.546]  You can obviously follow me at TheStoneZone.com, also at Rumble.com slash Roger Stone, where The Stone Zone is seen every day at 8 p.m.
[02:59:19.646 --> 02:59:20.006]  Eastern.
[02:59:20.507 --> 02:59:24.933]  Had the great privilege of being on with Alex Jones, who broke the biggest story
[02:59:25.393 --> 02:59:33.601]  Political story of the year which is of course RFK moving now I think inexorably towards endorsing Donald Trump tomorrow.
[02:59:33.761 --> 02:59:42.610]  I predict he shows up at the Phoenix rally with Trump and that will be that will be the biggest media event of the year.
[02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:43.731]  Let me ask you this, Roger.
[02:59:43.751 --> 02:59:44.892]  I'm trying to get the timing straight.
[02:59:44.912 --> 02:59:45.753]  Let me look real quick.
[02:59:46.334 --> 02:59:46.954]  Just real quick.
[02:59:47.014 --> 02:59:47.875]  I'm going to throw this in.
[02:59:48.616 --> 02:59:49.697]  I was told it was going to be L.A.
[02:59:49.717 --> 02:59:51.038]  Then I was told last night it's Phoenix.
[02:59:51.058 --> 02:59:51.639]  I looked it up now.
[02:59:51.659 --> 02:59:52.580]  They are saying Phoenix.
[02:59:53.181 --> 02:59:54.462]  He's going to speak at 2 p.m.
[02:59:54.602 --> 02:59:55.043]  Eastern.
[02:59:55.163 --> 02:59:57.425]  That would be depending on where he is in Arizona.
[02:59:57.925 --> 02:59:58.546]  Noon there.
[02:59:58.987 --> 03:00:00.168]  What time is Trump's rally?
[03:00:00.548 --> 03:00:01.549]  Because if it is... 4 p.m.
[03:00:02.210 --> 03:00:02.851]  Okay, boom.
[03:00:03.051 --> 03:00:03.251]  4 p.m.
[03:00:03.311 --> 03:00:03.791]  It's afterwards.
[03:00:03.812 --> 03:00:03.932]  Yep.
[03:00:04.712 --> 03:00:05.974]  Then I think Roger's right, Roger.
[03:00:06.932 --> 03:00:12.017]  Well, Donald Trump just announced a special guest that's going to be speaking at his rally, and it's probably RFK Jr.
[03:00:12.417 --> 03:00:13.699]  Well, we know one thing.
[03:00:13.759 --> 03:00:14.680]  It ain't Liz Cheney.
[03:00:15.498 --> 03:00:17.680]  Roger, when I told you this two nights ago, I called you.
[03:00:17.700 --> 03:00:18.800]  You're like, Are you sure?
[03:00:18.941 --> 03:00:22.963]  And I said, Man, unless unless the high level people in the campaign lied to me.
[03:00:23.023 --> 03:00:26.346]  Why do you think high level folks in the campaign would call me?
[03:00:26.386 --> 03:00:26.626]  They would.
[03:00:26.646 --> 03:00:27.527]  They just said, Well, we like you.
[03:00:27.567 --> 03:00:28.748]  You could just go ahead and do this.
[03:00:29.328 --> 03:00:29.988]  Well, what is that?
[03:00:30.109 --> 03:00:31.590]  And then I had I'll leave it alone.
[03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:33.431]  One of the top people today called me.
[03:00:33.491 --> 03:00:34.071]  I missed the call.
[03:00:34.111 --> 03:00:35.392]  He said they want to have dinner next week.
[03:00:35.753 --> 03:00:36.733]  So I don't know what's going on there.
[03:00:36.773 --> 03:00:37.474]  Very interesting.
[03:00:37.494 --> 03:00:38.114]  I'm not a political.
[03:00:38.134 --> 03:00:38.895]  What's that sound like, Roger?
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:41.841]  Look, I've got to hand it to you.
[03:00:41.881 --> 03:00:44.343]  You kind of doped us out before anyone.
[03:00:44.524 --> 03:00:50.210]  It took me a while to get some confirmations that there were indeed conversations going on.
[03:00:51.050 --> 03:00:54.434]  Now those same sources told me that there was an epic struggle here.
[03:00:54.975 --> 03:01:02.402]  Cheryl Hines, Robert Kennedy's wife, an ultra ultra liberal super progressive who really I think only went along with his
[03:01:03.243 --> 03:01:05.664]  As she said, we've got to stop the Uniparty together.
[03:01:05.684 --> 03:01:06.584]  America's in danger.
[03:01:27.113 --> 03:01:28.874]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[03:01:29.034 --> 03:01:32.996]  And she said the biggest mistake in her life was supporting the Democrats before and financing them.
[03:01:33.016 --> 03:01:34.036]  Chuck Schumer explicitly.
[03:01:34.117 --> 03:01:35.797]  I think she's really woken up.
[03:01:35.877 --> 03:01:37.958]  And helping them in Georgia specifically as well.
[03:01:38.118 --> 03:01:41.160]  Did you see Chuck Schumer dancing at that convention the other day?
[03:01:41.180 --> 03:01:43.701]  He obviously got his moves from Tim Walz.
[03:01:45.342 --> 03:01:46.183]  It was really awful.
[03:01:46.383 --> 03:01:58.469]  Well, Roger, since you're the expert on this, why do you think Tuesday afternoon I would get a call and be told this is going down, he'll endorse Trump on Friday at a big simulcast press conference.
[03:01:59.609 --> 03:02:01.050]  And I said, why are you telling me this?
[03:02:01.090 --> 03:02:03.391]  Well, you're a good guy, we want you to have this information.
[03:02:03.892 --> 03:02:04.872]  And I went ahead and went with it.
[03:02:05.132 --> 03:02:06.233]  Why do you think they gave me that?
[03:02:07.162 --> 03:02:14.207]  Well, because InfoWars has extraordinary reach, and not everybody who watches InfoWars is a Republican, that's for sure.
[03:02:14.627 --> 03:02:20.091]  Not everybody who watches and listens to InfoWars is necessarily a Trump supporter.
[03:02:20.131 --> 03:02:21.031]  I'd say it's probably about 80%.
[03:02:21.171 --> 03:02:29.637]  It's that 20% that Luke was referring to, people who are hesitant, they like a lot about Trump, but they're concerned about his
[03:02:30.137 --> 03:02:35.300]  Health freedom stance and his continued advocacy of warp speed.
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:47.267]  Having I think RFK inside the tent now and attacking the deep state will give those people assurances that he's going to have a voice in the new administration.
[03:02:47.727 --> 03:02:55.151]  I also think that that Tulsi Gabbard joining the Trump entourage cannot be understated in terms of its importance.
[03:02:55.432 --> 03:02:57.093]  It is a huge development.
[03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:58.213]  She's awesome.
[03:02:58.233 --> 03:02:58.754]  Very smart.
[03:02:58.794 --> 03:02:59.294]  Very beautiful.
[03:03:01.089 --> 03:03:07.112]  Well, imagine if the Democrats would have been smart and gotten out of the way, but they don't like her character.
[03:03:07.652 --> 03:03:10.674]  She could have, I mean, she would have been a contender against Trump, Roger.
[03:03:12.315 --> 03:03:14.136]  Well, I think she's got a great political future.
[03:03:14.156 --> 03:03:18.638]  I obviously want her at some point to become a Republican because I don't believe you can be elected.
[03:03:18.658 --> 03:03:20.099]  No, she has become a Republican, Roger.
[03:03:21.067 --> 03:03:22.248]  No, no, she's an independent.
[03:03:22.488 --> 03:03:23.849]  She's currently an independent.
[03:03:24.269 --> 03:03:35.276]  Yeah, they put her on a TSA terror watch list, and I think she understands that if Kamala Harris becomes president, she's going to become the main target of Kamala, who's, she really pissed off at the last kind of debate that they were in.
[03:03:36.436 --> 03:03:37.577]  She'll get the full Trump treatment.
[03:03:39.295 --> 03:03:43.297]  Well, she may not have officially said she's a Republican when she left the Democratic Party, but she's been behind Trump since then.
[03:03:44.077 --> 03:03:45.958]  She has been urging people to vote for Trump.
[03:03:45.978 --> 03:03:47.078]  That is absolutely true.
[03:03:48.139 --> 03:03:50.480]  And she's really a valuable member of the team.
[03:03:51.540 --> 03:03:56.723]  I think these two developments are seismic in terms of an entire
[03:03:57.543 --> 03:03:57.683]  I agree.
[03:03:57.763 --> 03:04:00.647]  How scared do you think the deep state is of Tulsi and RFK joining Trump?
[03:04:14.296 --> 03:04:15.397]  I think they're apoplectic.
[03:04:16.237 --> 03:04:18.398]  That's why I'm concerned about two things.
[03:04:18.619 --> 03:04:19.599]  I say this again and again.
[03:04:19.919 --> 03:04:24.061]  Another attack, another assault, another attempt to kill Trump.
[03:04:24.682 --> 03:04:33.427]  Clinton here made a very good argument that as Trump's election becomes more inevitable, their motive to try to take him out becomes greater.
[03:04:34.347 --> 03:04:35.768]  So I'm praying about this.
[03:04:35.808 --> 03:04:40.491]  I have no specific information, but I wrote a book in 2013 on the Kennedy assassination.
[03:04:40.852 --> 03:04:46.996]  I'm in the middle of researching and almost finishing a book on the attempted assassination of Reagan, and we've all seen what happened in Butler.
[03:04:47.296 --> 03:04:54.260]  So people who would kill one president, try to kill two others, will not hesitate to try to kill Trump if that's what it takes to stop him.
[03:04:54.461 --> 03:04:56.642]  And World War III and martial law is still on the table.
[03:04:56.662 --> 03:04:57.242]  Yeah, that's right, Luke.
[03:04:57.262 --> 03:04:58.463]  I think that's another possibility.
[03:04:58.623 --> 03:05:03.587]  Luke, can you put that article back on screen where they're now with no evidence trying to connect Crooks with these overseas accounts, the Iranians?
[03:05:03.607 --> 03:05:03.927]  That's key.
[03:05:04.707 --> 03:05:06.929]  I'm going to pull it up right now.
[03:05:06.949 --> 03:05:08.390]  Now let's go to their screen, guys.
[03:05:09.291 --> 03:05:11.132]  Let's go to Look Screen, of course.
[03:05:12.493 --> 03:05:13.113]  One second, guys.
[03:05:17.957 --> 03:05:27.143]  Trump shooter had three encrypted overseas accounts and Iranian plot threats.
[03:05:27.763 --> 03:05:28.484]  No evidence there.
[03:05:28.504 --> 03:05:29.905]  They're just literally throwing that out there.
[03:05:32.290 --> 03:05:38.996]  Such an obvious misdirect to try and get everybody that's upset about the attack on Donald Trump to focus on Iran.
[03:05:39.736 --> 03:05:42.439]  There's no chance in hell that they had any involvement with that.
[03:05:42.579 --> 03:05:44.961]  Wait, wait, they couldn't order the stand-down of the Secret Service and all that?
[03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:46.262]  No!
[03:05:46.282 --> 03:05:53.368]  Oh, this is disgusting.
[03:05:53.528 --> 03:05:54.629]  Everywhere I go...
[03:05:56.850 --> 03:06:02.014]  Remember, she was the least popular of what, 10 candidates for the Democrat nomination?
[03:06:02.834 --> 03:06:03.715]  Roger, how many were there?
[03:06:03.935 --> 03:06:05.176]  And she got less than 2%?
[03:06:05.896 --> 03:06:08.038]  She got less than 2% very recently.
[03:06:08.058 --> 03:06:17.024]  I mean, before Joe was forced out, one poll showed that she had the lowest approval rating of any vice president in recent history.
[03:06:17.044 --> 03:06:26.350]  In fact, a week before he resigned as vice president, Sparrow Agnew, who went down in a corruption scandal, had an approval rating two points higher than Kamala Harris.
[03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:29.893]  Her blood alcohol content is currently higher than she was polling in 2020.
[03:06:31.054 --> 03:06:35.918]  But now like Joe, she's sharp as a tack.
[03:06:36.798 --> 03:06:43.264]  What do you guys make of the Commerce Secretary not knowing about the Department of Labor and Statistics?
[03:06:45.186 --> 03:06:47.328]  It's because that number is astronomical.
[03:06:47.808 --> 03:06:54.514]  818,000 jobs they overstated in an attempt to try to tee up a talking point for an election.
[03:06:55.094 --> 03:07:05.423]  Barry Habib, who's a very respected housing and mortgage expert, a great economic analyst, called this on my By 77 WABC radio show weeks ago.
[03:07:05.463 --> 03:07:08.365]  He said, they are going to call back and restate these numbers.
[03:07:08.626 --> 03:07:09.186]  They're wrong.
[03:07:09.206 --> 03:07:10.067]  They're not even close.
[03:07:10.612 --> 03:07:16.736]  It was just three months ago that Biden's top economic advisor also went viral for not knowing how central banking works.
[03:07:17.236 --> 03:07:19.778]  So, yeah, this is not exactly surprising.
[03:07:19.798 --> 03:07:23.380]  Yeah, for those that haven't seen the clip, he just goes, look, I don't know how it works.
[03:07:25.041 --> 03:07:29.464]  Never let anyone tell you who you are.
[03:07:29.524 --> 03:07:31.785]  You show them who you are.
[03:07:31.805 --> 03:07:36.028]  You show them who you are.
[03:07:37.425 --> 03:07:39.466]  Oh my God, look at Maxine Waters.
[03:07:40.126 --> 03:07:40.866]  Like a rubber mask.
[03:07:40.906 --> 03:07:42.707]  Hair top looks rough.
[03:07:42.727 --> 03:07:44.628]  A bunch of criminals, we know who you are.
[03:07:45.308 --> 03:07:46.669]  Open borders.
[03:07:47.369 --> 03:07:47.969]  Inflation.
[03:07:48.089 --> 03:07:48.349]  World War III.
[03:07:48.369 --> 03:07:49.109]  Drag Queen pedophile time.
[03:08:01.810 --> 03:08:02.250]  Fentanyl.
[03:08:02.350 --> 03:08:02.950]  Disarmament.
[03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.771]  Communism.
[03:08:04.511 --> 03:08:05.331]  PCs everywhere.
[03:08:05.351 --> 03:08:05.691]  Food.
[03:08:05.711 --> 03:08:06.371]  Threat lines.
[03:08:06.692 --> 03:08:07.532]  Homeless people.
[03:08:07.552 --> 03:08:09.172]  Price controls.
[03:08:09.232 --> 03:08:14.454]  To the greatest democracy in the history of the world.
[03:08:15.914 --> 03:08:27.418]  And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty.
[03:08:28.661 --> 03:08:32.742]  We must be worthy of this moment.
[03:08:33.943 --> 03:08:34.903]  You sure as hell ain't worthy.
[03:08:34.923 --> 03:08:38.444]  It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done.
[03:08:38.464 --> 03:08:38.664]  Your turn?
[03:08:38.704 --> 03:08:40.625]  You've just been in power for four years, you witch.
[03:08:40.665 --> 03:08:41.605]  You stole the election.
[03:08:42.325 --> 03:08:44.226]  Guided by optimism and faith.
[03:08:44.246 --> 03:08:44.906]  We gotta put this clip out.
[03:08:44.946 --> 03:08:45.746]  It's our turn.
[03:08:45.766 --> 03:08:48.227]  To fight the penitentiary we love.
[03:08:48.247 --> 03:08:50.088]  It's like she's been on the merry-go-round for four years.
[03:08:50.108 --> 03:08:51.368]  She's like, wait a minute, I'm not getting off.
[03:08:51.388 --> 03:08:52.828]  To fight the ideals we cherish and to uphold.
[03:08:52.848 --> 03:08:54.629]  The Democrats haven't been in charge for 12 years.
[03:08:54.649 --> 03:08:55.229]  The past 16 years.
[03:08:58.070 --> 03:09:07.593]  The awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth.
[03:09:08.614 --> 03:09:12.135]  The privilege and pride of being an American.
[03:09:12.795 --> 03:09:13.255]  USA!
[03:09:13.895 --> 03:09:15.396]  They hand out USA signs.
[03:09:15.436 --> 03:09:16.416]  They hate USA signs.
[03:09:16.496 --> 03:09:18.497]  A little Democrat event, pull out an American flag.
[03:09:18.537 --> 03:09:19.017]  They hate it.
[03:09:21.098 --> 03:09:22.938]  They want to fool viewers.
[03:09:23.919 --> 03:09:25.019]  Look at that idiot.
[03:09:25.499 --> 03:09:27.140]  They're getting almost no viewers.
[03:09:29.201 --> 03:09:30.821]  All we're getting is clips that destroy them.
[03:09:30.841 --> 03:09:34.202]  God bless us for it being over.
[03:09:34.382 --> 03:09:34.982]  God bless us, everyone.
[03:09:54.521 --> 03:09:55.381]  That was nothing.
[03:09:55.981 --> 03:09:57.562]  That was absolutely no substance at all.
[03:09:57.602 --> 03:09:58.602]  No policies at all.
[03:09:58.682 --> 03:10:01.203]  Superficial fluff about gumbo and chess.
[03:10:01.663 --> 03:10:02.823]  Nothing else.
[03:10:03.003 --> 03:10:04.984]  But the usual attack on Donald Trump.
[03:10:05.204 --> 03:10:06.924]  Again, smearing Donald Trump.
[03:10:06.944 --> 03:10:08.644]  That's all they got.
[03:10:08.964 --> 03:10:09.965]  It really is all they have.
[03:10:10.125 --> 03:10:15.246]  Donald Trump hasn't been in office for almost four years, but that's all we've got to tell y'all.
[03:10:16.724 --> 03:10:18.525]  And he's just lying about his positions.
[03:10:18.725 --> 03:10:20.766]  No, he's going to cut Social Security.
[03:10:20.846 --> 03:10:22.627]  No, actually, he's not.
[03:10:23.487 --> 03:10:33.271]  Throughout the entire time he's been in the public arena, he's opposed any means testing or any delay in the age for which you can get your benefits.
[03:10:33.791 --> 03:10:37.433]  This is one of the reasons why he rejected Agenda 2025.
[03:10:38.493 --> 03:10:39.154]  Specifically.
[03:10:39.354 --> 03:10:53.764]  As overtly dislikable as she is, I have to imagine that if this election were legitimate, particularly after the heroic response that Donald Trump had kind of intrinsically after nearly dying five weeks ago, I would think that this election would be a landslide, honestly.
[03:10:54.425 --> 03:10:54.945]  In his favor.
[03:10:55.466 --> 03:10:55.766]  It is.
[03:10:55.806 --> 03:10:58.428]  They just have to convince us that she wins if they're able to steal it.
[03:10:58.448 --> 03:10:59.489]  It's all about convincing us.
[03:10:59.509 --> 03:11:01.810]  So they had to get rid of Biden because no one was going to buy that.
[03:11:01.870 --> 03:11:02.411]  Roger, you agree?
[03:11:03.632 --> 03:11:07.294]  Yeah, but that's why you have this multi-pronged PSYOP.
[03:11:07.334 --> 03:11:11.797]  So first, we cook the polls by oversampling Democrats.
[03:11:11.857 --> 03:11:16.380]  That way we can artificially prove that there's some surge in her public support.
[03:11:16.860 --> 03:11:25.546]  Then we funnel millions of dollars through ActBlue, which probably came from Soros, pretending like it came from individual donors.
[03:11:25.626 --> 03:11:28.308]  So she's, oh look, she's pulling in millions.
[03:11:28.328 --> 03:11:29.508]  They now claim $1 billion.
[03:11:29.528 --> 03:11:30.089]  $1 billion.
[03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:36.212]  Uh, this is, this is, uh, uh, the whole thing is a, a psy-op.
[03:11:36.332 --> 03:11:39.274]  And the judge, just to interrupt, the judge's department... They have to falsify the size of the crowd.
[03:11:39.754 --> 03:11:40.194]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:11:41.175 --> 03:11:43.396]  They have to falsify the size of her crowds.
[03:11:43.816 --> 03:11:47.598]  She, she can't pull a decent-sized crowd in Democrat strongholds.
[03:11:48.038 --> 03:11:52.900]  So they have to use AI to create these these graphic images.
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:56.461]  Then when you point that out, they say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:11:56.861 --> 03:11:59.142]  No, this woman can't pull a crowd.
[03:11:59.382 --> 03:12:04.224]  Just like Biden couldn't get 200 people to a union headquarters in Philadelphia.
[03:12:05.304 --> 03:12:07.065]  The whole thing is a massive
[03:12:07.805 --> 03:12:08.485]  I think so.
[03:12:24.234 --> 03:12:28.777]  50 people sitting in cars when he would go speak because they had to social distance and mask up.
[03:12:29.077 --> 03:12:30.458]  You don't have that lie anymore.
[03:12:30.518 --> 03:12:40.285]  So, there's only so many contrived, scripted events that they can hold where they have some huge pop star open for her to create some sort of contrived fanfare.
[03:12:40.585 --> 03:12:42.526]  I think it's ultimately going to fall apart.
[03:12:42.606 --> 03:12:44.588]  Yeah, that's the only crowd she's gotten.
[03:12:46.056 --> 03:12:58.605]  But going back to ActBlue, it's on record, and the Justice Department, of course, won't do anything because they run it, that tens of thousands, and I'm just saying hundreds of thousands of people, and they go to hundreds of their houses, and every one of them goes, I only make $20,000 or $30,000 a year or $40,000.
[03:12:59.166 --> 03:13:02.208]  They go, well, you've made hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations the last few years to ActBlue.
[03:13:02.528 --> 03:13:09.433]  And they're all low-level Democrat donors that gave $10 at one time, and then they just use their name to pump money through it.
[03:13:09.513 --> 03:13:10.474]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:13:11.408 --> 03:13:21.472]  Yeah, and in fact, ActBlue removes those requirements to have the credit card you use have the name on the card match or to give the address the billing address.
[03:13:21.572 --> 03:13:24.873]  So they make this kind of money laundering easy.
[03:13:25.514 --> 03:13:28.515]  There are over 60,000 so far that have been identified.
[03:13:28.535 --> 03:13:29.655]  There'll be many, many more.
[03:13:30.116 --> 03:13:33.237]  Again, the Federal Election Commission will do nothing about this because they're
[03:13:33.717 --> 03:13:36.100]  Three Republicans and three Democrats, so they're tied.
[03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:37.601]  Therefore, they never decide anything.
[03:13:37.902 --> 03:13:41.205]  But this is, without any question, a massive lawsuit.
[03:13:41.506 --> 03:13:43.548]  And the Republicans need to collect all this data.
[03:13:43.568 --> 03:13:45.210]  It's not that difficult to do.
[03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:47.692]  James O'Keefe has done an amazing job.
[03:13:48.293 --> 03:13:50.235]  Also, my friend Chris Gleason here in Florida.
[03:13:50.476 --> 03:13:53.739]  An amazing job of compiling all this proof.
[03:13:54.700 --> 03:13:56.920]  Well I do want to thank them for ending a little early tonight.
[03:13:57.261 --> 03:14:10.143]  What did you make Roger and the rest of the crew, Luke Rudowsky, there with your great production that we're simulcasting with, of them going till 12.30 Eastern, 11.30 Eastern Central, 11.30 Central on Monday.
[03:14:10.163 --> 03:14:11.583]  I mean, that was devastating.
[03:14:11.903 --> 03:14:20.985]  Like, again, nails on a chalkboard, Biden didn't quit speaking until 11.30 Central, 12.30, 30 minutes past midnight in the East.
[03:14:21.025 --> 03:14:21.665]  What was that about?
[03:14:22.563 --> 03:14:23.643]  I think that was willful.
[03:14:24.004 --> 03:14:28.045]  They want him to completely disappear, like he was never president.
[03:14:28.425 --> 03:14:37.309]  So they push him out of primetime, and then either out of peak because he's very angry, or because they force him out, he leaves immediately.
[03:14:37.369 --> 03:14:41.630]  He's not even there for the coronation of his vice president.
[03:14:42.250 --> 03:14:48.653]  Then they push Josh Shapiro, because they don't want to upset their Palestinian supporters, they push him out of primetime as well.
[03:14:49.153 --> 03:14:53.796]  Well, they want to push out one puppet to replace it with another puppet to, of course, do their bidding.
[03:14:53.896 --> 03:14:56.678]  And Kamala Harris, she's a shell of a candidate.
[03:14:56.998 --> 03:14:59.060]  She will do anything that they tell her to say.
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:00.761]  She is the establishment candidate.
[03:15:01.001 --> 03:15:07.285]  They used Biden up and they used the excuse of him being an old, senile man to push through some of the most unpopular policies.
[03:15:07.666 --> 03:15:09.027]  Now they need the new puppet.
[03:15:09.107 --> 03:15:13.950]  And I think today what we saw is them trying to bring back this kind of Barack Obama hope
[03:15:14.190 --> 03:15:17.273]  It's not a winnable one for the average American who is paying attention.
[03:15:40.532 --> 03:15:50.134]  And they're just hoping that the fluoride mines, the soy boys, the people with the low testosterone, and all the single cat women are going to be somehow galvanizing behind these individuals.
[03:15:50.194 --> 03:15:55.355]  And of course, the people who aren't paying attention will be, because they'll just be doing what the corporate media tells them to do.
[03:15:55.495 --> 03:15:57.076]  I still find this shocking.
[03:15:57.576 --> 03:15:57.956]  Shocking.
[03:15:58.336 --> 03:15:59.816]  This was her opportunity tonight.
[03:15:59.856 --> 03:16:01.016]  She's on a teleprompter.
[03:16:01.397 --> 03:16:03.817]  She could have said something, anything of substance.
[03:16:03.877 --> 03:16:07.498]  That was as thin as piss on a rock, as they used to say.
[03:16:08.058 --> 03:16:09.279]  Well, let me let me bring this up.
[03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:16.303]  You mentioned, Luke, that they want low testosterone women, men.
[03:16:16.423 --> 03:16:21.967]  I've got a whole bunch of clips here from CNN, MSNBC, literally saying Dana Bash, you name it.
[03:16:22.707 --> 03:16:25.349]  Dana Bash argued that Democrats are trying to speak to
[03:16:26.331 --> 03:16:36.478]  Who might not be the testosterone-laden, gun-toting type of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and understand that 2024, it's okay to be a man comfortable in his own skin.
[03:16:37.099 --> 03:16:39.320]  So yeah, they literally are hoping for Soy Boys.
[03:16:39.340 --> 03:16:40.141]  They're actually saying that.
[03:16:42.524 --> 03:16:44.505]  They brought it up in reference to Tim Walz.
[03:16:44.525 --> 03:16:48.806]  They're like, you see how low T and probably homosexual this guy is?
[03:16:48.907 --> 03:16:50.267]  You're right at home in the Democrat Party.
[03:16:50.687 --> 03:16:51.387]  There's just not enough.
[03:16:51.547 --> 03:16:56.669]  There's not enough guys in the in the United States that fit that demo that I think it can get them over the finish line.
[03:16:57.129 --> 03:17:03.231]  And ultimately, I think that that Kamala's, you know, dislikability factor is extraordinary.
[03:17:03.692 --> 03:17:09.854]  And if she talks at all and it's unscripted like this was this was as good as she's going to ever be.
[03:17:09.894 --> 03:17:10.674]  That's the whole point.
[03:17:10.834 --> 03:17:11.716]  Ever, ever, ever.
[03:17:12.016 --> 03:17:13.399]  And it was still god-awful.
[03:17:13.659 --> 03:17:16.464]  So, I don't think you can make this horse race.
[03:17:18.327 --> 03:17:18.787]  I agree.
[03:17:18.827 --> 03:17:20.029]  So what do they do now, Roger?
[03:17:21.974 --> 03:17:23.375]  Well, there's two things.
[03:17:23.675 --> 03:17:27.898]  One, they have the potential to elevate her by removing Joe Biden.
[03:17:27.918 --> 03:17:29.459]  We talked about this on your show.
[03:17:29.479 --> 03:17:31.080]  I talked about it on my show again today.
[03:17:32.161 --> 03:17:38.865]  It's kind of obvious to me that if they either force him out under the 25th Amendment, which they've tried already.
[03:17:39.185 --> 03:17:40.887]  They used that threat to get him out of the race.
[03:17:41.247 --> 03:17:44.569]  They could now use that to get him out of the presidency.
[03:17:44.989 --> 03:17:47.571]  Now that makes her a historic figure.
[03:17:47.651 --> 03:17:49.973]  That makes her the first woman president.
[03:17:50.413 --> 03:17:51.934]  You're not going to vote against the first woman president.
[03:17:51.954 --> 03:17:53.515]  What about other black swans?
[03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:19.521]  Well, Monkeypox seems to be on the move.
[03:18:19.561 --> 03:18:20.602]  You tell me, Alex.
[03:18:20.682 --> 03:18:27.009]  I mean, the World Health Organization seems to be ready to unveil the next pandemic.
[03:18:27.329 --> 03:18:40.722]  Well, the other angle that we haven't really got the answer to yet is that Iran has promised a response against Israel for the assassination of the, I guess, the lead diplomat of Hamas inside of Tehran.
[03:18:41.403 --> 03:18:42.825]  They have not responded.
[03:18:42.865 --> 03:18:47.770]  It's been about it's been over a week at this point, so I don't know if they've they've decided that they're not going to.
[03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:57.061]  But if they were to, that would obviously be a black swan, because I think that the United States, which has moved a lot of our our aircraft carriers out there, they would almost certainly respond in kind.
[03:18:57.461 --> 03:18:57.821]  That's right.
[03:18:57.941 --> 03:18:58.862]  What about tomorrow?
[03:18:58.882 --> 03:19:01.524]  I know I'm going to be on air live 11 a.m.
[03:19:01.544 --> 03:19:02.185]  to 3 p.m.
[03:19:02.325 --> 03:19:02.725]  Central.
[03:19:02.745 --> 03:19:05.387]  Then Owen and the rest of the crew, 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:19:05.407 --> 03:19:05.827]  in the War Room.
[03:19:06.167 --> 03:19:14.734]  I'd love to invite Luke and I'd love to invite Roger and any of you guys who are going to be on tomorrow during the day to cover and then give analysis.
[03:19:15.514 --> 03:19:16.375]  It'll be in my third hour.
[03:19:16.395 --> 03:19:21.819]  I'll do the fourth hour of RFK's big announcement tomorrow that's going to be simulcast.
[03:19:23.752 --> 03:19:25.854]  This is living history.
[03:19:26.215 --> 03:19:29.118]  Again, kudos to you for doping out this story.
[03:19:29.659 --> 03:19:31.041]  I was skeptical when I first heard it.
[03:19:31.141 --> 03:19:31.702]  I really was.
[03:19:31.762 --> 03:19:40.653]  I've seen this tactic used before, the head fake of pretending to get out, scheduling televised TV time, getting enormous free coverage.
[03:19:41.153 --> 03:19:45.154]  I thought at first as a cynical political type that that might be what RFK was doing.
[03:19:45.214 --> 03:19:49.255]  But in retrospect, I recognize, look, he is like his father.
[03:19:49.295 --> 03:19:50.816]  He's a fierce anti-communist.
[03:19:51.156 --> 03:19:52.336]  He does believe in freedom.
[03:19:52.356 --> 03:19:53.957]  He's wrong on a number of key issues.
[03:19:54.697 --> 03:19:58.898]  But on the larger issues of a deep state that's seeking to destroy the country,
[03:19:59.458 --> 03:20:00.319]  They killed his uncle.
[03:20:00.679 --> 03:20:01.660]  They killed his father.
[03:20:01.680 --> 03:20:03.181]  They tried to kill Donald Trump.
[03:20:03.502 --> 03:20:04.482]  He completely gets it.
[03:20:04.562 --> 03:20:05.183]  He sees it.
[03:20:05.964 --> 03:20:11.228]  Now having Kamala Harris come out in the last week and literally propose communism.
[03:20:11.468 --> 03:20:14.531]  I mean, we're just going to seize your company if we want to.
[03:20:14.551 --> 03:20:16.232]  We're going to take your patents.
[03:20:16.332 --> 03:20:18.194]  I have the will to do that, she says.
[03:20:18.214 --> 03:20:19.615]  I have the will!
[03:20:19.695 --> 03:20:20.516]  I have the will!
[03:20:20.536 --> 03:20:22.478]  She said, I have the will!
[03:20:24.158 --> 03:20:37.806]  Yeah, and another perspective here that we need to realize now with RFK in the picture, if the intelligentsia wants to launch another kind of bioweapon, it would be kind of stopped in its tracks and exposed right away with RFK playing a role within the Trump administration.
[03:20:38.086 --> 03:20:48.452]  So that's another major card there because the elites are probably going to a lot of these leaders and saying, we have this bioweapon we're going to release here and you're going to play ball with us or else we're going to cause this much calamity.
[03:20:48.892 --> 03:21:06.285]  RFK, in that perspective, in that seat, could prevent a lot of that from being exposed, as we're even hearing about potential news reports of Trump now saying that he will rehire former military members who were discharged for refusing the COVID vaccine and, quote, they will also receive back pay and an apology.
[03:21:06.565 --> 03:21:14.391]  Now, this is an unconfirmed report, but if this report is true, you are already seeing an RFK kind of influence on this larger anti-Statsman ticket.
[03:21:15.191 --> 03:21:17.733]  Trump has already said they shouldn't make the trips or anybody else take the shot.
[03:21:17.753 --> 03:21:18.913]  He's been saying that for four years.
[03:21:19.374 --> 03:21:21.375]  So, yeah, I mean, I believe that.
[03:21:22.516 --> 03:21:34.583]  No, that's a major step and that's going to reassure a lot of people who are a little bit skeptical here that, hey, he's actually going to be moving forward in the right direction and he's going to safeguard us if they try to release another kind of bioweapon.
[03:21:34.884 --> 03:21:40.227]  Now, another kind of key factor that I think we should be looking at right now is Ukraine kind of going for broke here.
[03:21:40.327 --> 03:21:46.590]  They have already invaded Russian territory, a major red line for the Russians that they said that they would not accept.
[03:21:47.010 --> 03:21:48.411]  I see them trying to provoke.
[03:21:48.471 --> 03:21:59.336]  I see them trying to go for broke in a very dangerous situation that could simply very easily escalate to grand proportions to where we have a fuller, bigger global conflict.
[03:21:59.596 --> 03:22:01.957]  And I think these people are capable of doing that.
[03:22:02.017 --> 03:22:09.481]  And I think that's something that it's on the table here, because if you look at a perfect way to kind of stop an election or set up martial law, that would be it.
[03:22:09.901 --> 03:22:16.845]  Specifically a full all out war with another nuclear power that I think is also on the table here, and it's absolutely terrifying.
[03:22:16.865 --> 03:22:18.886]  I agree, and I want to go back to the Iranians again.
[03:22:19.567 --> 03:22:23.849]  I'm seeing a lot of mainline Republicans, including one that's a former Secret Service agent.
[03:22:24.450 --> 03:22:27.451]  I don't think it's a bad guy, but I know it's not stupid, so this is really bad.
[03:22:27.892 --> 03:22:30.653]  Giving oxygen to the Iranians being behind Crooks.
[03:22:31.074 --> 03:22:32.514]  That is a load of crap.
[03:22:32.835 --> 03:22:33.955]  You saw the stand down.
[03:22:34.355 --> 03:22:35.256]  You know it went on.
[03:22:35.296 --> 03:22:36.317]  The deep state wants Trump dead.
[03:22:36.977 --> 03:22:37.698]  Horseman-er.
[03:22:38.058 --> 03:22:39.700]  I predicted it before they even rolled it out.
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:40.921]  Two days after they shot Trump.
[03:22:41.301 --> 03:22:42.182]  Two days after that.
[03:22:42.343 --> 03:22:43.844]  Four days after they came out and did that.
[03:22:44.124 --> 03:22:47.087]  This is as obvious as the nose on somebody's face.
[03:22:47.528 --> 03:22:49.129]  So we need to be very concerned.
[03:22:49.149 --> 03:23:00.061]  They are pre-programming with major propaganda that the Iranians are going to kill Trump because they know a second assassination attempt will blow up in their face unless they can saddle it on the Iranians and then launch a giant war.
[03:23:02.503 --> 03:23:03.104]  Couldn't agree more.
[03:23:03.304 --> 03:23:17.738]  I mean that and then I think the other major concern that we haven't talked about in terms of black swans or potential black swans with this employment data revision that happened basically wiping out all of the new hires over the past 12 months.
[03:23:18.399 --> 03:23:39.811]  I think that, along with the national debt being what it is, along with the employment figures, along with the inflation figures, even if Donald Trump wins, they could still have interest rate hiking that ultimately collapses the market and kind of saddle him with the economic implosion that is inevitably going to happen because the boom-bust cycle is very long in the tooth at this junction.
[03:23:39.871 --> 03:23:46.675]  So I think that's going to be, in my opinion, if Trump wins the election and he doesn't get assassinated, I know that's a lot of ifs,
[03:23:47.375 --> 03:23:52.480]  But then he has to worry about the economic fallout because they could definitely try and rug pull him.
[03:23:52.961 --> 03:23:54.262]  That's the other problem for them, though.
[03:23:54.302 --> 03:23:59.127]  I was on with Larry Kudlow the other day, and he made a very good case that we're already in recession.
[03:23:59.567 --> 03:24:04.032]  And it's going to get worse between now and the election, just in that short period of time.
[03:24:04.532 --> 03:24:06.413]  So they have a lot of obstacles.
[03:24:06.914 --> 03:24:10.456]  Their number one obstacle is they have a candidate who cannot speak.
[03:24:10.556 --> 03:24:15.119]  She's not capable of speaking in any kind of unstructured format.
[03:24:15.439 --> 03:24:21.984]  And obviously tonight, she's not even capable of speaking in a convincing way with a teleprompter.
[03:24:22.024 --> 03:24:26.487]  That was a first class dud just beginning to fact check it.
[03:24:34.292 --> 03:24:34.932]  Police officers.
[03:24:36.093 --> 03:24:37.073]  It was a litany.
[03:24:37.133 --> 03:24:41.856]  He told them to peacefully march into the Capitol.
[03:24:41.916 --> 03:24:42.496]  What about this?
[03:24:42.536 --> 03:24:50.520]  She said twice that we saw, because we were talking over, that I read it on the closed captioning, twice that it's our turn, it's our time.
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:51.501]  I know I'm going back to this.
[03:24:51.801 --> 03:24:53.822]  They've been in power for 12 of the last 16 years.
[03:24:54.142 --> 03:24:55.563]  She's been in power for almost four years.
[03:24:55.963 --> 03:25:00.645]  I think this is one of the strongest points the public gets when they're like, it's our time, give us a shot.
[03:25:00.685 --> 03:25:01.526]  What are you talking about?
[03:25:03.606 --> 03:25:04.727]  Yeah, they're in charge.
[03:25:05.088 --> 03:25:22.403]  You know, David Axelrod, who I think is a very smart guy, really the guy who conceived of and elected Barack Obama president, said that the euphoria in their party is misplaced, that the poll numbers aren't nearly as good.
[03:25:22.443 --> 03:25:24.264]  He called it irrational exuberance.
[03:25:25.025 --> 03:25:25.866]  Yes, exactly.
[03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:31.633]  Uh, this is, uh, this is, uh, really shaping up to be an extraordinary election.
[03:25:32.374 --> 03:25:46.703]  But it's still, it was always going to be close, it was always going to be competitive, because they have the mainstream media covering for them, and they have the massive censorship machine, uh, across all platforms, and those things have, unfortunately, still have major power.
[03:25:46.723 --> 03:25:48.844]  They don't have a monopoly that they had.
[03:25:49.344 --> 03:25:51.566]  They don't have the monopoly they had in 2020.
[03:25:51.926 --> 03:25:52.726]  We have a beachhead.
[03:25:53.487 --> 03:25:58.330]  But they still have huge assets to pass this massive PSYOP.
[03:26:20.644 --> 03:26:24.385]  Yeah, no, they're going to they're going to pull out all the stops.
[03:26:24.405 --> 03:26:25.366]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:33.028]  But as Roger was pointing out, we do have a beachhead alternative media and independent media is able to do audiences that actually supersede their own.
[03:26:33.328 --> 03:26:36.389]  However, they still have this kind of imprimatur of legitimacy.
[03:26:36.429 --> 03:26:37.709]  It allows them to set the frame.
[03:26:37.949 --> 03:26:40.850]  We're always put in the defensive of like they set the narrative.
[03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:41.670]  We disprove it.
[03:26:41.710 --> 03:26:44.531]  We have to deliver the truth, but it usually takes us 30 or 45 days.
[03:26:46.512 --> 03:26:47.834]  I think that is our biggest challenge.
[03:26:47.854 --> 03:26:49.516]  They're going to try and flood the zone with lies.
[03:26:49.836 --> 03:26:55.143]  Can we actually disabuse the American people of these false notions prior to November?
[03:26:55.483 --> 03:26:56.024]  That's the challenge.
[03:26:56.064 --> 03:26:57.726]  So this is the situation that we're in right now.
[03:26:57.766 --> 03:26:59.148]  They're not going to get a bump from this.
[03:26:59.188 --> 03:26:59.728]  There's no way.
[03:26:59.768 --> 03:27:00.609]  There was no substance.
[03:27:00.649 --> 03:27:01.671]  There was no likeability.
[03:27:02.031 --> 03:27:02.671]  We're good to go.
[03:27:21.997 --> 03:27:30.530]  A lot of very sinister people that assassinate people that lie to people that start wars that murder people that torture people willingly knowingly and they're proud of it.
[03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:37.400]  Those are the type of people that we're dealing with right now that also have the control of Google that also have the control of Facebook of
[03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:38.181]  That's right.
[03:28:02.839 --> 03:28:13.252]  Being willing to of course speak out against a government that has been wrong and has become that much more dangerous against everyone else, we would be in a lot of an awful situation.
[03:28:13.633 --> 03:28:21.663]  We are in a make or break moment for America right now and truly the next few days will decide our path as either a communist nation,
[03:28:22.063 --> 03:28:22.964]  Or a free nation.
[03:28:23.064 --> 03:28:32.954]  And that path is decided by all of us, especially the viewers watching right now that are able to talk to their loved ones, to their family members, to the random people at the store, to the random people that they're walking by in the street.
[03:28:33.374 --> 03:28:38.219]  These people need to get activated and engaged more than ever now before it's too late.
[03:28:38.279 --> 03:28:41.242]  No, I agree because if the globalists are able to steal this election and get in power...
[03:28:41.983 --> 03:28:43.023]  They are going to go for broke.
[03:28:43.043 --> 03:28:44.284]  They're going to clamp down on everybody.
[03:28:44.364 --> 03:28:46.905]  Worst you've ever seen will look just like the UK or Australia.
[03:28:47.925 --> 03:28:57.928]  This is such a serious moment, but we have the power as the people and folks understand this, and that's why it's so critical that every person out there listening when this is archived
[03:28:58.648 --> 03:29:07.895]  WeAreChange.org or Infowars.com or RealAlexJones or StoneZone.com that you share this, you take clips out of this, because you never know who's going to see it and what's going to happen.
[03:29:08.235 --> 03:29:18.122]  We've got to get outside of our populist, nationalist, common sense bubble, and we've got to reach out to people, you know, that 30% that don't vote and try to desperately get them engaged.
[03:29:20.923 --> 03:29:22.445]  What Alex said is exactly true.
[03:29:22.905 --> 03:29:24.326]  Evangelical Christian turnout, 2016, 78%.
[03:29:24.386 --> 03:29:24.827]  2020 drops to 63%.
[03:29:24.907 --> 03:29:25.107]  Wow.
[03:29:25.147 --> 03:29:26.388]  We have to get those numbers back.
[03:29:26.408 --> 03:29:28.110]  That lost the election right there!
[03:29:33.885 --> 03:29:34.606]  They're up right there.
[03:29:35.066 --> 03:29:41.933]  So, and Trump is making very significant inroads into traditionally Democratic voter groups.
[03:29:42.033 --> 03:29:45.797]  I mean, he's making, he's hitting historic numbers, particularly among Hispanics.
[03:29:46.117 --> 03:29:49.100]  We have never done better than a third among Hispanic voters.
[03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:53.264]  Right now he is leading her 48-45 amongst Hispanics.
[03:29:54.145 --> 03:29:56.187]  That is a, that is a historic,
[03:29:56.607 --> 03:29:57.528]  How can he not?
[03:29:57.808 --> 03:30:01.150]  I mean, so many of us have fled communism, socialism.
[03:30:01.271 --> 03:30:06.995]  How can he not be making that type of lead on somebody who is so clearly a communist?
[03:30:07.135 --> 03:30:09.657]  Because the Mexicans and the Puerto Ricans don't see it that way.
[03:30:11.022 --> 03:30:15.825]  Seriously, you can't look, obviously, at all Hispanics monolithically.
[03:30:16.565 --> 03:30:26.851]  The most Democrat-based voters have traditionally been Puerto Ricans and Mexicans, but even they, I think largely for economic reasons, are moving towards Trump.
[03:30:27.471 --> 03:30:36.576]  I had a briefing yesterday on the campaign's Evangelical Christian Outreach Program, their African American Outreach Program, their Hispanic Outreach Program.
[03:30:37.017 --> 03:30:39.238]  People who say that this campaign is not a fine
[03:30:39.798 --> 03:30:40.458]  Let me just add this.
[03:31:02.833 --> 03:31:04.293]  They wouldn't have tried to kill Trump.
[03:31:04.313 --> 03:31:05.394]  That was a total inside job.
[03:31:05.434 --> 03:31:06.254]  All the evidence is clear.
[03:31:06.274 --> 03:31:08.694]  You don't have to be an idiot not to understand that.
[03:31:09.215 --> 03:31:13.656]  And now they have a cover up of what happened and no press conferences, no information, cremate the body.
[03:31:14.096 --> 03:31:16.436]  They wouldn't have tried to kill him if they thought they were going to win.
[03:31:16.516 --> 03:31:17.297]  They're scared.
[03:31:18.177 --> 03:31:19.277]  And they know they're being watched.
[03:31:19.397 --> 03:31:23.558]  And so right now, even the betting markets have Trump winning unless they kill him.
[03:31:23.618 --> 03:31:25.639]  So guys, I want to thank you all.
[03:31:25.719 --> 03:31:27.419]  I'm going to cut out of your simulcast here.
[03:31:27.839 --> 03:31:28.819]  And I wish you all well.
[03:31:29.260 --> 03:31:30.300]  Luke and
[03:31:31.340 --> 03:31:31.721]  Roger.
[03:31:32.122 --> 03:31:32.662]  I'm on tomorrow.
[03:31:32.702 --> 03:31:37.030]  I'd love to have you guys both pop in either before Kennedy or after.
[03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:41.437]  But regardless, I love your crew, love the show, Luke, and it's been really great talking to you tonight.
[03:31:41.457 --> 03:31:42.238]  So thank you so much.
[03:31:43.103 --> 03:31:44.283]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:31:44.364 --> 03:31:45.304]  You're the spear.
[03:31:45.424 --> 03:31:46.905]  You're doing incredible work.
[03:31:46.945 --> 03:31:48.605]  You're breaking a lot of important stories.
[03:31:48.685 --> 03:31:50.446]  We all wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[03:31:50.486 --> 03:31:52.267]  So thank you so much for doing that.
[03:31:52.307 --> 03:31:54.107]  We're going to continue a little bit of our coverage here.
[03:31:54.628 --> 03:31:55.968]  And thank you so much, Alex.
[03:31:55.988 --> 03:31:56.709]  It really means a lot.
[03:31:56.769 --> 03:31:57.969]  Yeah, we're on Rumble.
[03:31:58.269 --> 03:31:58.729]  All one word.
[03:31:58.789 --> 03:32:00.210]  We Are Change is our channel.
[03:32:00.230 --> 03:32:01.511]  We've got an exclusive deal over here.
[03:32:02.151 --> 03:32:05.452]  I'm Clint Russell, host of Liberty Lockdown, and I will be on TimCast IRL tomorrow.
[03:32:05.512 --> 03:32:08.353]  So thank you for having us, Alex, and vice versa.
[03:32:08.553 --> 03:32:08.914]  Thank you.
[03:32:08.934 --> 03:32:09.874]  And to the ladies, thank you.
[03:32:11.445 --> 03:32:11.805]  Thank you.
[03:32:12.145 --> 03:32:12.506]  Thank you.
[03:32:13.146 --> 03:32:14.627]  There he goes, folks.
[03:32:14.707 --> 03:32:15.568]  Thanks, Bill.
[03:32:16.428 --> 03:32:19.350]  Okay, let me say bye to all the viewers.
[03:32:20.771 --> 03:32:21.652]  I want to thank the crew.
[03:32:22.572 --> 03:32:24.013]  We have a crew.
[03:32:25.333 --> 03:32:25.873]  We have a crew of.
[03:32:26.874 --> 03:32:27.275]  I don't know.
[03:32:27.415 --> 03:32:27.955]  Eight people.
[03:32:28.155 --> 03:32:31.478]  Nine people that runs the morning show with Harrison Smith.
[03:32:31.498 --> 03:32:32.439]  8 A.m.
[03:32:32.479 --> 03:32:33.200]  here at six.
[03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:36.322]  We have and that crew crosses over to my show.
[03:32:36.603 --> 03:32:36.803]  11 A.m.
[03:32:36.823 --> 03:32:37.483]  to three p.m.
[03:32:37.583 --> 03:32:39.445]  in the war room with Owen.
[03:32:40.646 --> 03:32:41.707]  Uh I just love Owen to death.
[03:32:41.727 --> 03:32:43.869]  Uh everybody's asking where Owen is.
[03:32:43.929 --> 03:32:46.371]  He chose to take vacation this week, and he's a hard working guy.
[03:32:46.391 --> 03:32:48.032]  So you want to take it during the DNC?
[03:32:48.092 --> 03:32:48.372]  I get it.
[03:32:48.392 --> 03:32:49.714]  He doesn't see it as exciting, and it's
[03:32:53.937 --> 03:32:56.979]  So, uh, we watch him so you don't have to.
[03:32:56.999 --> 03:32:58.200]  There's a big audience watching right now.
[03:32:58.220 --> 03:33:03.564]  But what's really getting the views is the clips we're pulling out, putting on X and boil downs and then fours dot com.
[03:33:04.364 --> 03:33:09.028]  But we have a crew that's been working 17 18 hours a day this week.
[03:33:09.668 --> 03:33:13.671]  So it'll be a rest for them to be able to go home at six o'clock Central tomorrow.
[03:33:13.691 --> 03:33:16.313]  That'll be we'll be able to cover JF R F K Jr.
[03:33:16.673 --> 03:33:21.256]  We'll be able to cover the Trump rally and the surprise guest he's got coming.
[03:33:21.276 --> 03:33:22.297]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[03:33:22.337 --> 03:33:23.238]  It's going to be R F K Jr.
[03:33:24.279 --> 03:33:30.487]  The only way that I'm not right is if the campaign lied to me, because I got this really high level.
[03:33:31.469 --> 03:33:32.370]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[03:33:33.231 --> 03:33:39.379]  And Tuesday afternoon show, I don't just, I mean, I get things wrong sometimes, but never on purpose.
[03:33:40.043 --> 03:33:46.368]  I mean, I was calling his VP Sheehan at Shanahan.
[03:33:46.388 --> 03:33:49.191]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff because I don't have a teleprompter.
[03:33:49.271 --> 03:33:52.273]  I screw up names and flip numbers on accident.
[03:33:52.313 --> 03:33:54.675]  I'll listen to rebroadcast because that's completely wrong.
[03:33:55.216 --> 03:33:57.037]  But you can bet I want to be right.
[03:33:57.318 --> 03:33:58.519]  I want to do the research.
[03:33:58.679 --> 03:33:59.700]  I want to get the truth to you.
[03:34:00.759 --> 03:34:06.082]  But on big issues, I'm like 97-98% accurate, because I really spend my time on this one.
[03:34:06.142 --> 03:34:10.444]  I say there's a good chance they're going to try to kill Trump, and may kill him, and blame Iran and start World War III.
[03:34:10.845 --> 03:34:12.366]  I mean, I am getting chills.
[03:34:12.466 --> 03:34:14.006]  I am physically upset about this.
[03:34:14.046 --> 03:34:21.811]  I'm a father of four children, and I'm an American, and I'm a human on this planet, and we are so close to doom with these psychotics running things.
[03:34:21.871 --> 03:34:24.813]  So, when I tell you about the Iran stuff, I think you can all see it yourselves.
[03:34:24.833 --> 03:34:26.814]  You don't need me to tell you, though I called it first.
[03:34:26.934 --> 03:34:28.995]  I mean, that goes into deep thinking.
[03:34:29.737 --> 03:34:32.685]  To the point of just my top of my head about to blow off.
[03:34:32.745 --> 03:34:33.788]  I just have so much intel.
[03:34:34.430 --> 03:34:36.235]  And so this is a historic time.
[03:34:36.616 --> 03:34:37.178]  And here's another thing.
[03:34:37.947 --> 03:34:44.212]  You know, I was telling my mother, who's a great person, like, last week I was visiting her house, having dinner with her and my family, and all my children were there.
[03:34:44.232 --> 03:34:45.253]  Two of them have already moved out.
[03:34:45.853 --> 03:34:52.959]  But Rex was there, Charlotte was there, Georgia was there, my youngest daughter, V, was there, and Veronica.
[03:34:53.159 --> 03:34:57.723]  And, you know, we were there, and I said, man, I'm just really worried about Trump.
[03:34:57.743 --> 03:34:58.684]  We're going to be praying for him.
[03:34:58.844 --> 03:34:59.705]  We've got to get him in there.
[03:34:59.725 --> 03:35:02.447]  My mom goes, you know, you should worry about our family and not Trump.
[03:35:02.687 --> 03:35:03.608]  No, she likes Trump.
[03:35:03.628 --> 03:35:04.949]  She just, you know, has issues with him.
[03:35:05.589 --> 03:35:06.710]  And I said, mother,
[03:35:07.813 --> 03:35:10.255]  Don't you—and we're at the dinner table—I go, don't you understand?
[03:35:10.275 --> 03:35:14.780]  Have you heard him say they're not coming after him, they gotta get through him to get to us?
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:15.801]  Well, it's the same for me.
[03:35:15.821 --> 03:35:25.490]  If they are able to kill Trump, or they are able to steal this election, they are gonna prosecute and persecute all of us.
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:28.162]  Show, this isn't about vengeance.
[03:35:28.182 --> 03:35:29.484]  This isn't about any of this.
[03:35:29.504 --> 03:35:30.625]  But I have personal skill in the game.
[03:35:30.805 --> 03:35:38.313]  And folks, they're coming after you and your family with all this globalism and all this transgenderism and the open border and the crime and the communism, okay?
[03:35:38.854 --> 03:35:41.417]  I mean, this is serious frickin' business, okay?
[03:35:42.278 --> 03:35:44.580]  Show, I want to salute and thank the crew.
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:45.321]  I want to thank everybody.
[03:35:45.341 --> 03:35:46.342]  And I want to just say this again.
[03:35:46.382 --> 03:35:47.303]  You think this is a game?
[03:35:48.627 --> 03:35:58.801]  I need your support at drjonesandadgles.com plus your great products and you go there half the stuff you click on sold out because my dad doesn't even have the money right now to buy most of the great products we had before.
[03:35:59.201 --> 03:36:05.810]  We've got to sell out of everything else we've got left that are great products like next level financial energy and the nano silver products and all the rest of it.
[03:36:06.331 --> 03:36:10.995]  And he just, you know, took most of the money he's got and, you know, reordered Turbo Force and two other things.
[03:36:11.275 --> 03:36:12.957]  That doesn't come in for, you know, 10 weeks.
[03:36:13.057 --> 03:36:13.297]  Who knows?
[03:36:13.337 --> 03:36:14.018]  We'll be here then.
[03:36:14.318 --> 03:36:16.420]  That's a whole other story of what's going on behind the scenes.
[03:36:16.820 --> 03:36:18.501]  For strategic reasons, I haven't told you yet.
[03:36:19.102 --> 03:36:20.103]  I will be telling you soon.
[03:36:20.223 --> 03:36:21.424]  It is wild.
[03:36:22.024 --> 03:36:25.707]  I mean, you think, I mean, we are here because of your support, prayer and the grace of God.

[03:36:51.098 --> 03:36:52.419]  It's not a stimulant, but it has that effect.

[03:38:25.010 --> 03:38:25.650]  I'm not bitching.
[03:38:25.690 --> 03:38:27.091]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[03:38:27.452 --> 03:38:31.795]  But if you want people to fight for you and you want to fight a communist takeover, you got to fight.

[03:38:42.645 --> 03:38:44.707]  I want to end because we didn't get to it all because
[03:38:45.247 --> 03:38:45.828]  We're good to go.
[03:39:01.041 --> 03:39:04.102]  This is the most badass crew that goes through incredible hell.
[03:39:04.503 --> 03:39:15.328]  They haven't had a raise in years, a bonus in years because of the bankruptcy crap, but they are just absolutely warriors in the Second American Revolution, the Infowar, and I salute them and I thank them.
[03:39:15.528 --> 03:39:16.528]  Incredible job, crew.

[03:39:22.291 --> 03:39:22.731]  Central.
[03:39:23.352 --> 03:39:25.993]  The War Room, I think Chase is doing it, 3 p.m.
[03:39:26.013 --> 03:39:29.755]  Central, but I'll be on it with him and all the rest of it with the Trump rally and RFK Jr.
[03:39:30.595 --> 03:39:31.815]  Infowars.com.
[03:39:32.055 --> 03:39:33.296]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:39:34.456 --> 03:39:40.838]  With only 75 days left to the election and the deep state desperate, President Trump's life has never been in more danger.
[03:39:41.398 --> 03:39:42.259]  But not from Iran.
[03:39:43.799 --> 03:39:47.240]  The deep state is preparing another attempt on President Trump's life.
[03:39:47.860 --> 03:39:50.161]  And this time, they're going to frame Iran for it.
[03:39:58.044 --> 03:40:00.805]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[03:40:02.386 --> 03:40:04.047]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:40:05.208 --> 03:40:07.869]  President Trump's life is in serious danger.
[03:40:08.969 --> 03:40:15.813]  The deep state already tried to kill him and failed on July 13th of this year, just 40-something days ago.
[03:40:16.653 --> 03:40:23.737]  And two days after it happened, I came out and said, the deep state is going to try again and they're going to try to frame
[03:40:24.773 --> 03:40:25.173]  Iran.
[03:40:25.974 --> 03:40:28.756]  And now, they are officially doing it.
[03:40:30.096 --> 03:40:34.919]  The big move is to hit them with a large truck bomb.
[03:40:34.959 --> 03:40:38.121]  Again, it's in the cards to use a small nuclear weapon and blame the Iranians.
[03:40:39.342 --> 03:40:40.323]  They'll be the fall guys.
[03:40:41.363 --> 03:40:43.245]  And then instantly, we're in full war with Russia.
[03:40:44.225 --> 03:40:46.046]  Instantly, the air raid sirens are going off.
[03:40:46.166 --> 03:40:48.268]  Instantly, life as you know it is over.
[03:40:49.208 --> 03:40:50.229]  And they're going to use the war
[03:40:51.716 --> 03:40:59.562]  To try to get Americans to, oh my God, you know, we got hit by a nuke, Iran, Iran, you know, with Russia, you know, and then everybody's off the air except the corporate news.
[03:41:00.323 --> 03:41:07.648]  And then you're going to see all hell break loose because there are people inside all those corporate news organizations and inside the government that are our people.
[03:41:08.268 --> 03:41:09.670]  Everyone's going to know it's the deep state.
[03:41:09.690 --> 03:41:10.930]  They're not going to blame it on Iran.
[03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:11.851]  That's who they're going to do it.
[03:41:12.712 --> 03:41:14.133]  That's who they're going to blame it on.
[03:41:14.193 --> 03:41:15.394]  And I know there's scenarios
[03:41:16.949 --> 03:41:23.073]  And so it's not alarmist to say this, and I think we need to really get on the table out front to the globalists.
[03:41:23.513 --> 03:41:24.414]  We know your plans.
[03:41:24.434 --> 03:41:25.334]  We know your operations.
[03:41:25.374 --> 03:41:26.155]  We know your history.
[03:41:27.335 --> 03:41:31.037]  And again, what do they do to get the sympathy back or to change the subject?
[03:41:31.117 --> 03:41:32.418]  Some horrible event.
[03:41:33.919 --> 03:41:38.762]  And again, if their next assassination attempts fail, if they're unable to poison him, that's the default.
[03:41:38.782 --> 03:41:39.622]  They're going to try to poison him.
[03:41:40.503 --> 03:41:43.685]  And if they can't get a shooter in, and if they can't get a truck bomb in close enough,
[03:41:45.806 --> 03:41:53.171]  If they put the barricades far enough back in Milwaukee, they're gonna wait till he's back in Mar-a-Lago or somewhere and roll a truck bomb in there.
[03:41:53.611 --> 03:41:54.031]  Guaranteed.
[03:41:55.252 --> 03:41:56.773]  And say the Iranians did it.
[03:41:57.453 --> 03:41:59.475]  Now that's just one example of dozens.
[03:42:00.275 --> 03:42:02.076]  Just days after I predicted it.
[03:42:02.477 --> 03:42:13.424]  And then a few days after I predicted that, four days after he got grazed in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI came out and said, we have credible threats at the Mulas.
[03:42:14.449 --> 03:42:19.133]  Over in Iran, the Ayatollah is trying to kill Trump and might have been involved.
[03:42:19.694 --> 03:42:22.396]  Oh, did the mullahs have the Secret Service stand down?
[03:42:23.037 --> 03:42:24.798]  Did they pull most of the security off?
[03:42:25.639 --> 03:42:34.247]  Did the mullahs have the Secret Service not point the man out on the roof for over 26 minutes or 90 minutes down below with a rangefinder and now we know a rifle?
[03:42:34.667 --> 03:42:37.149]  Man, those mullahs have magical powers.
[03:42:38.044 --> 03:42:53.330]  So now, there's an article in Newsmax, similar propaganda everywhere, from conservative media we can trust, that, oh, absolutely, there's a big plot to kill Trump, and the Ayatollah wants him dead before the election.
[03:42:53.810 --> 03:42:56.251]  I wonder who else wants him dead before the election.
[03:42:56.611 --> 03:43:07.015]  And Trump really fell into this trap when Netanyahu spoke to Congress a few weeks ago and said the Mullahs are going to try to kill Trump, and Trump said on Truth Social, well, if they kill me, destroy Iran!
[03:43:08.629 --> 03:43:10.452]  They actually sent death squads.
[03:43:11.533 --> 03:43:17.342]  They sent death squads here to murder a former Secretary of State and a former National Security Advisor.
[03:43:18.003 --> 03:43:22.689]  And as we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President Trump.
[03:43:24.412 --> 03:43:25.053]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:43:26.311 --> 03:43:32.358]  You have Homeland Security, you have the whole DHS, FBI, Secret Service system, fingerprints all over the assassination.
[03:43:32.699 --> 03:43:34.120]  The Deep State wants Trump gone.
[03:43:34.761 --> 03:43:39.367]  And now Israel's saying, well, if Trump gets killed, it's Iran's fault.
[03:43:39.427 --> 03:43:41.729]  And Trump goes, yeah, if I get killed, blow up Iran.
[03:43:42.458 --> 03:43:52.022]  President Trump, you're digging your own grave, inviting the deep state to kill you so they can attack Iran, keep you out of office, and clamp down on the American people.
[03:43:52.383 --> 03:43:54.544]  This is absolutely insane.
[03:43:54.884 --> 03:43:56.585]  And it's not like I'm pointing this out now.
[03:43:57.825 --> 03:44:04.148]  I pointed it out before they even put out their propaganda because I study them and I'm many steps ahead of them.
[03:44:04.568 --> 03:44:08.010]  Again, if I hadn't even predicted this days before they started this,
[03:44:09.008 --> 03:44:11.009]  And you know, that's a little bit old, that chart.
[03:44:11.029 --> 03:44:12.871]  That chart's a couple of months old.
[03:44:12.951 --> 03:44:16.613]  And if you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[03:44:40.188 --> 03:44:44.330]  And finally, Iran came out a month ago and said, we don't want Trump dead.
[03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:45.991]  We're not involved in your elections.
[03:44:46.331 --> 03:44:47.752]  We're not trying to assassinate him.
[03:44:48.092 --> 03:44:48.973]  We don't want war.
[03:44:49.593 --> 03:44:51.814]  Israel just killed the two leaders of Hamas.
[03:44:52.315 --> 03:44:54.076]  Iran didn't even strike back.
[03:44:54.856 --> 03:44:56.397]  Iran is being very, very cautious.
[03:44:56.437 --> 03:44:57.458]  I'm not a fan of the mullahs.
[03:44:57.518 --> 03:44:59.599]  I'm just simply saying they understand
[03:45:00.219 --> 03:45:04.280]  That the globalists are about to blow them off the map and Trump could be the detonator.
[03:45:04.640 --> 03:45:05.980]  So this is a maximum alert.
[03:45:06.521 --> 03:45:09.101]  President Trump's life is in grave danger.
[03:45:09.121 --> 03:45:16.143]  And this is coming to you from the guy that first predicted they would try to assassinate President Trump going back several years ago.
[03:45:16.543 --> 03:45:18.044]  We've called it over and over again.
[03:45:18.064 --> 03:45:20.364]  The deep state's been caught trying to kill him.
[03:45:20.724 --> 03:45:23.405]  So now they're trying to sell the idea that the Iranians did it.
[03:45:24.278 --> 03:45:25.358]  You know they're going to try it again.
[03:45:25.378 --> 03:45:27.619]  They've already given us their cover story.
[03:45:27.939 --> 03:45:29.379]  Are we really this stupid to buy it?
[03:45:29.899 --> 03:45:32.600]  President Trump's life is in grave danger.
[03:45:39.561 --> 03:45:41.161]  Please support us at InfoWareStore.com.

[03:46:04.393 --> 03:46:08.054]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[03:46:08.114 --> 03:46:09.374]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[03:46:09.394 --> 03:46:19.457]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
