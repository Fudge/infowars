[00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:14.053]  We're good to go.
[00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.458]  All right, welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:30.900]  InfoWars.com live coverage of the Democratic National Convention night two.
[00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:33.341]  It's Tuesday the 20th of August.
[00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:37.323]  I'm coming to you live from the InfoWars world headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:43.666]  And we will be commenting on and covering the speakers tonight at the DNC.
[00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.067]  Right now it's the
[00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:50.006]  It's the nobodies and they're, you know, doing something.
[00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:50.787]  Who knows?
[00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:55.292]  This Democratic convention, it's unlike any other convention that we've ever had before.
[00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.414]  And they'll tell you that.
[00:00:56.654 --> 00:01:00.239]  And prior to the convention, all of the news stories had that same theme.
[00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:01.120]  This one's different.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.783]  This one's more like a dance party, okay?
[00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:04.964]  Than a political event.
[00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:06.927]  There's more joy in this one.
[00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:33.745]  What they really mean is that this is the first convention in American history to not actually be a convention, to not actually have any political wrangling, to have no delegates debating, no behind-the-scenes deals, no uncertainty about who's going to be the nominee, no surprises, no actual democratic participation at all.
[00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:35.806]  So that's what conventions used to be.
[00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:41.088]  It used to be a time to come together, sort out differences, establish policy, make deals.
[00:01:41.128 --> 00:01:46.350]  Alright, I'll drop out and give you my delegates if you can assure me a position in the... This is how the sausage was made.
[00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.331]  The political sausage got ground here at the convention.
[00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:49.952]  Not anymore though.
[00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:50.952]  Now it's a dance party.
[00:01:51.352 --> 00:01:58.775]  Now it's a big gay dance party where your leaders are dictated from on high and you just dance around like you love it.
[00:01:59.416 --> 00:01:59.636]  Okay?
[00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:07.728]  So we got vasectomies, abortions in the back, rioters in the front, it is dystopia manifest, and it's the Democratic National Convention.
[00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:13.971]  So we'll be watching it, we'll be watching along as all of the Democratic greats speak tonight.
[00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:20.094]  Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama will grace us with their appearance.
[00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.214]  Governor J.B.
[00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:26.537]  Pritzker will be there, as well as Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.
[00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.501]  Second Gentleman Doug Imhoff will be giving a speech, apparently.
[00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:38.383]  I think also Chuck Schumer is slated to be here.
[00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:40.584]  I believe Alex Jones will be stopping by.
[00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:41.945]  Chase Gosar will be joining me later.
[00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:49.329]  I'm gonna take calls for probably the first hour while they, I don't know, do whatever the hell this is that you're seeing on screen.
[00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.572]  So while they're engaged in a weird, gay, pseudo-political dance party,
[00:02:57.793 --> 00:02:58.554]  We'll take your calls.
[00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:22.000]  Again, whatever this is, whatever we're watching on screen here, go on.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.401]  We're not going to watch it much longer.
[00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:28.965]  We're going to begin with a report Alex Jones filmed about this breaking news minutes ago.
[00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:33.189]  New York Times is reporting that Biden signed a secret order to command U.S.
[00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.031]  forces to prepare for simultaneous nuclear war.
[00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.374]  You can find this on his Twitter account, at RealAlexJones.
[00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:44.498]  Here is this special report about the danger of nuclear conflict coming from the Biden White House.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:59.823]  The New York Times is now reporting that in March of this year, Joe Biden ordered the Pentagon to prepare to target, to war game, a simultaneous nuclear war with Russia, China, and North Korea.
[00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:16.262]  In a New York Times article published today titled, Biden Approves Secret Nuclear Strategy Refocusing on China Threat.
[00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:29.512]  And in the article they report on a secret national security memorandum of the Pentagon ordering the Pentagon to prepare for simultaneous nuclear war with China, Russia, and North Korea.
[00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:36.394]  Now, if this actually happens, which we're closer than ever with Ukrainian-backed NATO forces,
[00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:37.395]  We're good.
[00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.374]  We're talking about the doomsday clock being the closest it's ever been to midnight with the International Atomic Scientist Organization.
[00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:59.396]  They say we're the closest we've ever been to nuclear war.
[00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:00.356]  And here's the deal.
[00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:26.432]  We've had nuclear weapons since the mid-40s, Russia's had them since the 50s, China's had them since the 60s, and now many, many, many nations have them.
[00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:32.078]  But in all the war games, once you start using them, everybody is destroyed.
[00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:38.205]  That's where the term MAD comes from, Mutually Assured Destruction.
[00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:51.860]  So we've survived for close to 80 years with nuclear weapons, only seeing them used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and those were tiny weapons compared to what the weapons do today.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.846]  To give you an idea, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the equivalent of the head of a pin.
[00:05:58.647 --> 00:06:03.751]  If it was on the screen compared to the weapons they've got now that have a blast radius this large.
[00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:07.614]  The size of a large medicine ball or beach ball.
[00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:12.518]  And there's graphs online, there's brand corporation graphs that show this.
[00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:21.065]  Tiny little bitty explosion destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki compared to the weapons that are in the different arsenals today.
[00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:22.446]  China tested the largest.
[00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:33.262]  ...above ground weapon ever that was several thousand times bigger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just to give you an idea of what we're dealing with.
[00:06:33.442 --> 00:06:38.970]  And we've had NATO starting the war 11 years ago in Ukraine, pushing Russia to escalate two and a half years ago.
[00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:49.829]  And now this total insanity is unfolding with Biden and his controllers saying that he has created peace in the world when they have created the complete opposite.
[00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.794]  We need President Trump now more than ever to have detente and to make deals and de-escalate, which he did when he was president.
[00:06:57.234 --> 00:06:59.035]  We need him to bring in RFK Jr.
[00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:00.296]  into his administration as well.
[00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:02.778]  We need to bring the world back
[00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:05.200]  From the brink of thermal nuclear war.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:13.726]  And the reason the globalists want nuclear war, and believe it's going to be survivable, is the global debt bubble's coming to an end, and they don't want to be blamed for the giant fraud they've created.
[00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:18.790]  They need a global crisis to bring in the Great Reset and their planetary cashless society.
[00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:27.498]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be covering all of this tonight during the DNC live coverage at InfoWars.com forward slash show and on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:31.501]  But this is serious, serious business, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:35.986]  You'll also find the report linked under right here on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.027]  Thank you for watching.
[00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:37.687]  Pray for peace.
[00:07:38.008 --> 00:07:43.673]  Now let's take peaceful political action to take our nations and our world back from the psychotic globalists.
[00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.799]  There is major breaking news and it is extremely exciting.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:09.029]  ROK Junior's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, just came out today on a podcast and said they're strongly looking at dropping out of the race, and they have big support, in some polls over 10%, to President Trump.
[00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:16.595]  Trump is already in real polls 10 to 15 points conservatively ahead of the Democrats.
[00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:20.998]  But the Democrats have been using skewed polls and manipulated data to claim their neck and neck.
[00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:22.999]  So the people still think she has a chance.
[00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:29.283]  And of course we know they have baked in fraud with the illegals voting and folks voting in the names of dead people.
[00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:31.405]  They've been caught over and over again doing it.
[00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:36.829]  So Trump needs 10 points or more, a landslide, to override the fraud.
[00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:52.882]  If RFK comes in and full-throatedly and full-heartedly endorses President Trump, there is no way Trump would be winning by at least, conservatively, 20 points nationwide, 15 points or so in battleground states.
[00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:54.263]  Those are the numbers.
[00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:57.065]  This would add, conservatively, 6 to 10 points.
[00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:05.571]  Now, if you wonder why this is happening, Trump and RFK Jr.
[00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.934]  have been friends, they've gotten along, they've not really attacked each other.
[00:09:09.334 --> 00:09:18.881]  But the Democrats have savagely attacked RFK Jr., they've tried to keep him off the ballot, they've demonized him, and of course they have denied Secret Service protection to RFK Jr.
[00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:24.845]  when both his father, the Attorney General, and his uncle, the President, were murdered by the deep state.
[00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:37.269]  And on top of it, the corporate media, Stephen Colbert, all of them have come out and attacked him and celebrated it when he has been illegally taken off the ballot in places like New York.
[00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:51.373]  So, if they're going to screw him and not let him run or not let him be in the debates, then it's the honest thing to do, it's the right thing to do, to go with Trump who is also anti-establishment and has the corrupt deep state
[00:09:52.313 --> 00:09:58.235]  After him, both men have a shared history of assassination attempts to their families or to themselves.
[00:09:58.595 --> 00:09:59.415]  This is going to be amazing.
[00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:03.497]  And on top of it, imagine RFK Jr.
[00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:05.517]  as the Attorney General.
[00:10:06.058 --> 00:10:09.259]  He is so good on so many fronts and so many issues.
[00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:18.702]  And I believe as an honest broker, even though I disagree with him on some issues, I believe he is a man of integrity and a good person and someone that wouldn't work with the deep state.
[00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:20.262]  To assassinate Trump.
[00:10:20.282 --> 00:10:24.483]  So he's also a major insurance policy for President Trump.
[00:10:24.863 --> 00:10:25.823]  So this is a dream team.
[00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:29.844]  He could also be the head of the NIH, the National Institutes of Health.
[00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:32.364]  He could be the head of the EPA.
[00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:34.465]  He could be the head of the Department of Energy.
[00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:37.305]  But really the head of the Department of the Interior.
[00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:43.906]  But really where he could do the most good would be as the Attorney General of the United States.
[00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:47.527]  I think Tulsi Gabbard should also be announced as a cabinet position.
[00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:50.928]  She is hugely popular in the Democratic Party as well.
[00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:52.088]  She's become a Republican.
[00:10:52.328 --> 00:10:53.309]  She's a good person.
[00:10:53.349 --> 00:10:54.209]  She's very smart.
[00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:56.910]  He needs to draft both R.F.K.
[00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.250]  Jr.
[00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.350]  and Tulsi Gabbards in.
[00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.210]  But the R.F.K.
[00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.510]  Jr.
[00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.350]  thing is massive.
[00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:06.792]  A lot of folks are pointing out that Trump could be building a superstar dream team with Elon Musk, J.D.
[00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:07.833]  Vance, R.F.K.
[00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:10.253]  Jr., Tulsi Gabbards and more.
[00:11:10.693 --> 00:11:12.434]  So again, this is so exciting.
[00:11:13.294 --> 00:11:15.435]  This story is going mega viral everywhere.
[00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:17.135]  We'll show you the short clip here in a moment.
[00:11:17.796 --> 00:11:19.756]  And we need RFK Jr.
[00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:27.679]  to come out now with only 76 days left to the election and fully endorse Trump and then be a surrogate campaigner just like J.D.
[00:11:27.739 --> 00:11:29.700]  Vance, who's doing a superlative job.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.461]  We need to see RFK Jr.
[00:11:31.881 --> 00:11:36.362]  on the campaign trail with Trump, with Vance, and by himself and with Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:11:36.682 --> 00:11:40.664]  They can also make all the rounds on Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson again.
[00:11:41.423 --> 00:11:43.184]  They can do X spaces with Elon.
[00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:49.649]  They're talking about bringing in Elon to the administration, obviously, with the Office of Government Accountability and Efficiency.
[00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.411]  This is just awesome.
[00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:59.056]  People know that there is no future of security or safety or stability or freedom under Kamala Harris.
[00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:00.497]  They know that she's been installed.
[00:12:00.858 --> 00:12:02.419]  She didn't get one vote in the primaries.
[00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:03.940]  Neither did Walls.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.502]  They got as many votes as Ronald McDonald did.
[00:12:06.863 --> 00:12:07.804]  This is a fraud.
[00:12:07.844 --> 00:12:10.206]  They removed Biden in a coup d'etat.
[00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:14.810]  Nancy Pelosi bragged about it last night on national television that she, quote, did what she had to do.
[00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:16.232]  This is insane.
[00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:28.283]  So I'm going to show you the clip where she's talking about it, the vice presidential candidate with RFK Jr., and then I'll show you Colbert attacking him, and it's crap like this.
[00:12:28.823 --> 00:12:31.564]  And they're arrogance that's going to defeat them.
[00:12:31.804 --> 00:12:33.264]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:12:33.864 --> 00:12:43.607]  Please follow me at RealAlexJones for more developments and also tune into Infowars.com for its live show or at RealAlexJones for the live feeds of my regular weekday show 11 a.m.
[00:12:43.887 --> 00:12:44.607]  to 3 p.m.
[00:12:44.627 --> 00:12:50.749]  The other Infowars shows are also there and tonight, that's this Tuesday night, we'll be covering Big Mike.
[00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:59.653]  Obama, all of them, and the DNC with our own color commentary of this corrupt, evil clown show that's trying to start World War III.
[00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:06.676]  So for world peace, we need Trump, we need RFK Jr., we need Elon Musk, and we need you in the info war to spread the word.
[00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:09.017]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:09.297 --> 00:13:19.022]  If you want freedom, and you want national security, and you want to cut inflation, and you want a future, and you don't want endless war, then get behind Trump right now.
[00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:42.143]  I'll see you at Ronald Jones on X. There's two options that we're looking at and one is staying in forming that new party but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and Waltz presidency because we draw votes from Trump or we draw somehow more votes from Trump or
[00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:57.080]  We walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump and, you know, we walk away from that and we explain to our base why we're making this decision.
[00:13:59.862 --> 00:14:00.883]  Not easy.
[00:14:00.903 --> 00:14:02.745]  Clearly.
[00:14:03.245 --> 00:14:04.727]  Yeah, not an easy decision.
[00:14:05.995 --> 00:14:15.032]  A junior here got some bad news yesterday when a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that he is disqualified from the New York ballot over falsifying his residence.
[00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:30.757]  Prosecutors, you're right, prosecutors proved he actually lives in Los Angeles thanks to a federal statement of candidacy with a California address and a social media video in which Kennedy talks about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.
[00:14:30.777 --> 00:14:32.857]  Oh, foiled again!
[00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:37.899]  And he would have gotten away with it too if he wasn't the weirdest person on the planet.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.981]  RFK Jr.
[00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:48.086]  claims this is just a misunderstanding because he has considered New York his home since childhood and intended to return.
[00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.747]  That doesn't make it better.
[00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:54.350]  It's not like a surgeon saying, you're in good hands, Mr. Johnson.
[00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.931]  I intended to finish medical school.
[00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.453]  Now let's get stabbing.
[00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:04.666]  Anyway, this news sucks for him, but it is great for me.
[00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:06.087]  Can I ask you about RFK?
[00:15:06.107 --> 00:15:10.189]  Because just moments ago, his running mate said that they were considering endorsing you.
[00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:13.671]  Have you considered him for a role in the administration, and what role would that be?
[00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:17.353]  Well, we haven't, but I would love that endorsement, because I've always liked him.
[00:15:17.413 --> 00:15:20.155]  Would you also consider putting him in the administration?
[00:15:21.284 --> 00:15:23.327]  You're asking me a very unusual question.
[00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:24.669]  I haven't been asked that question yet.
[00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.311]  I like him a lot.
[00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:27.393]  I respect him a lot.
[00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:30.778]  I probably would if something like that would happen.
[00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:41.472]  Alright, folks, you can find and share that report at realalexjones on X. You are watching the live coverage of the DNC night two on InfoWars.
[00:15:41.492 --> 00:15:45.053]  The Democratic National Catastrophe is happening right now.
[00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:52.075]  And as you're watching these reports, you're seeing in the bottom right hand corner of your screen, they're doing a roll call right now or a.
[00:15:53.815 --> 00:16:02.440]  Yeah, it's the roll call, so it is, and I'm not kidding, it's literally just a gay dance party at this point, so there's nothing really to listen to or to pay attention to.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.582]  Apparently Little John just introduced to Georgia's contingent.
[00:16:08.163 --> 00:16:12.085]  So it's, hey, the adults are back in charge, folks, and don't you forget it.
[00:16:12.924 --> 00:16:14.765]  Alex Jones will be here a little bit later.
[00:16:14.785 --> 00:16:16.267]  Chase Geiser will be here a little bit later.
[00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:22.471]  We will, of course, go to the live speeches tonight with Michelle Obama, a.k.a.
[00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:26.694]  Big Mike, as well as former President Barack Obama, Governor J.B.
[00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:35.861]  Pritzker, Second Gentleman Doug Imhoff will be speaking as well as a number of other people, including Chuck Schumer and others.
[00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:36.902]  Folks,
[00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:39.800]  M4 is the only place to watch this.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.541]  It's the only place to watch this coverage.
[00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:42.081]  What are you going to do?
[00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:43.682]  Listen to Chuck Schumer speak?
[00:16:44.262 --> 00:16:50.446]  Or listen to Alex Jones, myself, to mock Chuck Schumer while he tries to speak?
[00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:58.910]  This should be the only reason anybody's tuning into the DNC, to see the people there being mocked, ridiculed, and exposed in real time.
[00:16:59.611 --> 00:17:01.772]  This is a fact-checking stream, is what it is.
[00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:11.897]  Now as they continue the roll call and the weird DJ set, we're gonna go to another video here, a flashback video from all the way back in, I believe, 1987.
[00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:20.047]  It's a flashback to Phil Donahue interviewing, at the time, already world-renowned businessman Donald Trump.
[00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:24.899]  And we'll go to that video and watch it as long as we can.
[00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.740]  And if anything interesting happens at the DNC, we'll jump in and talk about it.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.641]  But we are live.
[00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:35.303]  I'm Harrison Smith, your host, Alex Jones, Chase Geyser, joining me a little bit later, taking your phone calls as well.
[00:17:35.904 --> 00:17:41.686]  And make sure to share this stream at InfoWars on Twitter, InfoWars.com forward slash show and at Real Alex Jones.
[00:17:41.766 --> 00:17:45.888]  It's the Democratic National Catastrophe returning just as soon as the action starts.
[00:17:45.928 --> 00:17:49.490]  Until then, enjoy this flashback interview of Phil Donahue and Donald Trump.
[00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:52.510]  Worth 800 million bucks.
[00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.230]  I read it in the paper.
[00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.292]  And you're not even... Are you 40?
[00:18:01.412 --> 00:18:01.632]  I'm 41.
[00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:01.632]  41.
[00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:08.214]  I want to show you what he just bought.
[00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:15.516]  He bought Marjorie Merriweather Post's 150 rooms.
[00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:17.216]  56 bedrooms this guy's got.
[00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:19.777]  Ian Pomp, show him, Brian.
[00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.331]  This is Mar-a-Lago.
[00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.252]  That's an aerial view.
[00:18:23.453 --> 00:18:24.494]  Now listen to this.
[00:18:24.514 --> 00:18:26.195]  There are two pictures here, are there not?
[00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:27.836]  You've got to see this place.
[00:18:28.077 --> 00:18:28.517]  Look at this.
[00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:39.246]  He has a staff of 50, 30 security guards, and this guy can't buy your lunch after Black Monday.
[00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:40.227]  How did you do?
[00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:41.889]  You must have lost your shirt.
[00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:42.209]  Come on.
[00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:45.580]  No, I was lucky I was out of the market pretty much, Phil.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.381]  Like you.
[00:18:46.781 --> 00:18:48.121]  Like you and like a lot of others.
[00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:53.104]  I think most of the people in your group, I don't suspect too many of you were in the stock market during the little crash.
[00:18:53.584 --> 00:18:54.224]  A couple were.
[00:18:54.244 --> 00:18:55.085]  A couple were.
[00:18:55.165 --> 00:18:55.565]  I wasn't.
[00:18:55.765 --> 00:18:56.745]  I like real estate better.
[00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:03.048]  This, uh... When he graduated from college, he had $200,000.
[00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:07.050]  Went to the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pittsburgh.
[00:19:08.127 --> 00:19:08.547]  I'll tell you.
[00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:09.288]  University of Pennsylvania.
[00:19:09.328 --> 00:19:10.608]  I'm sorry, University of Pennsylvania.
[00:19:10.748 --> 00:19:11.348]  I'll tell you this.
[00:19:11.488 --> 00:19:15.590]  You know, I kind of, after reading your book, I kind of like your father better than you.
[00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.091]  He's a nice guy.
[00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:18.351]  You have good taste?
[00:19:18.551 --> 00:19:19.712]  He's a good guy.
[00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:20.872]  Show him, number one.
[00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:23.773]  Let's just try and briefly give you a bio here.
[00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:26.354]  This is Fred Trump, age 80-something.
[00:19:27.054 --> 00:19:28.275]  Yeah, he's 81.
[00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:28.275]  81.
[00:19:29.515 --> 00:19:33.397]  He built middle-income housing in Queens and Brooklyn.
[00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:38.529]  And little Donald go along and rummage around the construction sites.
[00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.032]  And obviously his father taught him a thing or two along the way.
[00:19:42.072 --> 00:19:43.573]  Look, uh, let's see number three.
[00:19:44.253 --> 00:19:49.817]  Here, here's, uh, here's 12-year-old Donald inspecting, uh, yeah, checking out the geology.
[00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:52.519]  I don't know what you're doing there, but, uh, now, listen to this.
[00:19:52.559 --> 00:20:00.665]  Your parents, uh, enlightened as they were, sent you to, next slide, the New York Military Academy.
[00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:03.227]  Only you went not in this uniform.
[00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:05.056]  Is that somewhere in the computer?
[00:20:06.037 --> 00:20:06.578]  There you go.
[00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:08.139]  Look at the proud parents.
[00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:13.324]  Obviously the strap is so you'll keep your mouth shut.
[00:20:15.786 --> 00:20:16.868]  And your graduation photo.
[00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:17.348]  Next slide.
[00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:19.510]  Just give them a quick trip here.
[00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:23.093]  Look at this.
[00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:24.555]  So you came out disciplined.
[00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:28.383]  You probably said yes sir, no sir, and all those... It was a good education.
[00:20:28.443 --> 00:20:29.123]  It was a good training.
[00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:30.404]  It was a good training.
[00:20:30.444 --> 00:20:30.985]  I enjoyed it.
[00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:34.087]  You didn't get married until you were 30-something.
[00:20:34.247 --> 00:20:35.127]  31 years old.
[00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.069]  You lived in a small apartment in Manhattan.
[00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:39.270]  A little small apartment.
[00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.011]  I had a lot of good time in that apartment.
[00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:41.811]  That was a lot of fun.
[00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:44.113]  I've had more fun in that apartment than I have in Trump Tower.
[00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:46.334]  As good as Trump Tower.
[00:20:47.155 --> 00:20:47.455]  Your dad...
[00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:52.100]  ...would build medium-priced housing.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.584]  And the rules, as I understand the game, as you explain it to us in this book, trump the art of the deal.
[00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:02.408]  And not a few folks are rolling the dice on this one, too.
[00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:07.632]  The front page of the Wall Street Journal today tells us that they're printing 150,000 copies.
[00:21:08.673 --> 00:21:09.814]  Tweaked your cheek a bit.
[00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:10.454]  You said there were 200.
[00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:13.255]  Exaggerating, Mr. Hyte.
[00:21:13.275 --> 00:21:18.320]  No, I'll tell you truthfully, I thought it was $200, and I think it will be $200, but I'm not sure what it is.
[00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:20.042]  I don't know what it is exactly.
[00:21:20.142 --> 00:21:20.643]  It's $150,000 to $200,000.
[00:21:20.723 --> 00:21:21.363]  Uh-huh.
[00:21:21.704 --> 00:21:21.984]  I guess.
[00:21:22.004 --> 00:21:22.825]  I don't know.
[00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.947]  Are you going to sign books in the stores and do all that stuff?
[00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:26.308]  Every once in a while, I might have to do it.
[00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:26.629]  Uh-huh.
[00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:27.269]  Whatever it takes.
[00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:28.551]  All the money is going to charity.
[00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:30.473]  I'm giving all of the proceeds to charity, so...
[00:21:31.153 --> 00:21:33.254]  It's nothing for me, but it's something very important.
[00:21:33.294 --> 00:21:38.596]  I'd like the charities to get a lot of money, and I'd like to also make it nice and successful, because I like having successes.
[00:21:38.676 --> 00:21:41.096]  I like success much better than failure, somehow.
[00:21:41.117 --> 00:21:41.697]  I don't know.
[00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:49.099]  Show them Mrs. Trump.
[00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:50.860]  Number 7, that is, in our computer.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.781]  Ivana is her name.
[00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.182]  She was a top fashion model and a... Yes, she was.
[00:21:56.242 --> 00:21:56.902]  Look at here.
[00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:00.980]  And also a skier, I believe, a near Olympian.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.822]  That's correct.
[00:22:03.862 --> 00:22:04.762]  Here you are in your honeymoon.
[00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:05.302]  Next slide.
[00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.584]  Where'd you go on the honeymoon?
[00:22:08.604 --> 00:22:09.964]  You probably went to Atlantic City?
[00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:11.325]  We were in Hawaii, actually.
[00:22:14.046 --> 00:22:14.686]  Oh, Hawaii.
[00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:17.688]  You really have caught the attention.
[00:22:17.748 --> 00:22:20.909]  You're a star, Mr. Trump, and you're a businessman.
[00:22:22.123 --> 00:22:24.264]  And you do not run away from publicity.
[00:22:24.904 --> 00:22:29.485]  We can only speculate on how long you may have posed for these rather flatter... Not long.
[00:22:29.645 --> 00:22:30.145]  Not long.
[00:22:30.185 --> 00:22:36.406]  The good part about being a... I don't have enough time to do a lot of posing, and fortunately we have some pretty good photographers, so they get good pictures.
[00:22:36.926 --> 00:22:39.167]  But it's not a lot of time, Phil.
[00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:41.127]  I just don't have the time, unfortunately.
[00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:44.128]  You... Your father had to come in.
[00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:48.309]  At the right price, and he also was entitled to 7.5% profit.
[00:22:48.329 --> 00:22:49.750]  Is that what I understand?
[00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.151]  Basically, that's right, yes.
[00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:55.194]  And so he had to really count the nails just to... A much different business.
[00:22:55.494 --> 00:22:56.455]  There's no question about it.
[00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:58.977]  I mean, I count the nails also, but I count them in a different sense.
[00:22:59.497 --> 00:23:04.060]  My father built low and moderate income housing in Brooklyn and Queens, and it was a tough business.
[00:23:04.701 --> 00:23:06.982]  And today, that kind of a business really doesn't even exist.
[00:23:07.062 --> 00:23:10.625]  Unfortunately, you don't have the government programs that allowed you to do this years ago.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.549]  My business is much different than that, and it's turned out to be wonderful, but it's much different.
[00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:18.292]  It's a much different kind of a business.
[00:23:20.217 --> 00:23:31.059]  You say that in order to ensure that he was profitable, this made it very necessary for your father to be... He was at the site at six, wasn't he, in the morning?
[00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:36.541]  He was there early in the morning, and he'd leave late at night, and every nail was going to be counted, and he knew every contractor.
[00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:39.401]  As I do, really, you have to know what you're doing.
[00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:42.382]  You take a look at the city of New York, they can't build an ice skating rink.
[00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:47.343]  An ice skating rink was under construction, I guess, for a period of seven years, the Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park.
[00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:48.936]  And they couldn't build it.
[00:23:49.116 --> 00:23:52.339]  They spent 12 or 14 million dollars, which was supposed to cost two.
[00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:57.243]  And we did it for, uh, in about four months, as you know, for a very small amount of money.
[00:23:57.263 --> 00:23:57.803]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[00:23:57.823 --> 00:23:58.804]  Big, big success story.
[00:23:58.864 --> 00:23:59.565]  No doubt about it.
[00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:04.268]  You came in and came in under, and you did it in months when the city was fooling around.
[00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:08.011]  It was a very interesting statement on government bureaucracy, etc., etc.
[00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:12.475]  And boy, you looked like a Republican businessman standing there when they cut the ribbon.
[00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:13.376]  But who's to complain?
[00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:15.838]  They're skating as we speak in Central Park.
[00:24:16.405 --> 00:24:21.932]  Now you try to get in, you're single, and you're out of the Wharton School, and you've moved to Manhattan.
[00:24:22.513 --> 00:24:23.915]  Leaving your roots, we might say.
[00:24:24.115 --> 00:24:26.438]  Ahem, we can only speculate on how your father felt about that.
[00:24:27.678 --> 00:24:30.399]  And you want to join the club, Le Club.
[00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:32.580]  Well, you know that club, Phil.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.720]  You're there all the time.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.042]  I mean, you know, he's putting on the little lack of pronunciation here now.
[00:24:39.102 --> 00:24:40.783]  You were never at Le Club?
[00:24:40.943 --> 00:24:41.443]  Call me anything.
[00:24:41.483 --> 00:24:42.323]  Don't call me a hypocrite.
[00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:43.623]  I've never been to Le Club.
[00:24:43.924 --> 00:24:46.464]  But I'd be proud to be there someday.
[00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.125]  This is not a... I don't mean... Fine.
[00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:51.946]  You meet... Now, there won't... Who is this guy, Trump?
[00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:52.767]  He's 27 years old.
[00:24:52.787 --> 00:24:55.327]  The guy says, you know, we don't... It's, you know...
[00:24:57.674 --> 00:25:00.135]  So he calls the president and he gets them to have a drink with him.
[00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:02.396]  They go to 21, and these guys are drinking.
[00:25:04.237 --> 00:25:05.637]  Now, I just wasn't used to that.
[00:25:06.597 --> 00:25:08.178]  You say, listen fellas, I gotta go home.
[00:25:08.398 --> 00:25:09.639]  They say, nah, let's have one more.
[00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:11.839]  Now, I wasn't used to that, you say.
[00:25:11.879 --> 00:25:13.480]  I have a father who's always been a rock.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.641]  Very straight and very solid.
[00:25:16.021 --> 00:25:16.581]  I believe that.
[00:25:17.101 --> 00:25:22.103]  My father would come home every night at 7, have his dinner, read the newspaper, watch the news, and that was that.
[00:25:23.524 --> 00:25:23.804]  Swedish.
[00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:28.652]  Yes, Swedish, German, a lot of different things.
[00:25:28.772 --> 00:25:30.173]  Mostly good, right?
[00:25:30.293 --> 00:25:32.574]  And good, strong guy, yes.
[00:25:32.814 --> 00:25:33.615]  Good, solid man.
[00:25:33.735 --> 00:25:37.738]  And his father probably plowed his rows straight, or whatever they... His parents, yes.
[00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:38.098]  Right.
[00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:41.060]  And I'm as much of a rock as my father.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.521]  This was a totally different world.
[00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:45.903]  I remember wondering if every successful person in Manhattan was a big drinker.
[00:25:46.924 --> 00:25:50.366]  I figured if that was the case, I was going to have a big advantage.
[00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:56.271]  Uh, the guys almost passed out and you helped them home and you got in the club.
[00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:57.073]  I got in.
[00:25:57.254 --> 00:25:58.297]  Later on I got in, yes.
[00:25:58.437 --> 00:25:59.179]  You're a rock!
[00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.130]  You don't drink at all?
[00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:05.153]  Well, when I say rock, I mean, I think of myself as being a solid guy.
[00:26:06.193 --> 00:26:08.114]  You have different definitions of people nowadays.
[00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:13.277]  You have the word flake, you have people that are strong, people that aren't strong, and everyone is fine.
[00:26:13.317 --> 00:26:17.339]  I'm just saying that I would say that I'm rather solid and I'm proud of that.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.822]  So I was a little, when I came into Manhattan at first, I saw people that were not
[00:26:22.432 --> 00:26:22.572]  Uh-huh.
[00:26:39.985 --> 00:26:42.147]  You drink, then, a white wine while you're standing?
[00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.027]  I really don't drink at all.
[00:26:43.127 --> 00:26:43.988]  You don't drink at all?
[00:26:44.148 --> 00:26:45.468]  You know, I don't drink for a lot of reasons.
[00:26:45.488 --> 00:26:47.049]  I don't like what it does to people.
[00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:52.392]  I figure it can't be good, and I just don't really enjoy the taste, perhaps most importantly, but I don't like it.
[00:26:52.933 --> 00:26:58.796]  I've seen so many people over the years that I had great respect for, and then we'd go out and I'd see them totally lose control.
[00:26:59.748 --> 00:27:02.991]  And all of a sudden I say, why would a person subject themselves to that?
[00:27:03.011 --> 00:27:10.919]  I mean, I've had people who I have tremendous respect for, and then you go out to dinner and you have to literally carry them from the table to their house.
[00:27:10.939 --> 00:27:11.720]  Not a good thing.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.762]  No, I don't like it.
[00:27:14.282 --> 00:27:17.565]  Mike Wallace called this to your attention during the 60-minute piece on you.
[00:27:19.247 --> 00:27:20.488]  You're always dressed up.
[00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:24.032]  I mean, at the poolside in your Greenwich home.
[00:27:24.694 --> 00:27:29.437]  In the Sunday afternoon, you come up with the soap guy, and that's just who you are, huh?
[00:27:30.037 --> 00:27:31.718]  It's just, I don't know, I tend to be formal.
[00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:35.301]  I like being formal somehow, and I'm not always dressed up.
[00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:48.749]  On a Sunday, I'm not dressed up, and on a Saturday, depending on what I'm doing, but generally, I tend to be doing business, and usually, for business, I feel that you should be sort of attired a certain way, and I've always been somewhat formal in that regard.
[00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.989]  Right.
[00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:52.231]  I'd rather be a little bit too formal than not formal enough.
[00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:53.352]  Uh-huh.
[00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:57.649]  I'll bet you you pick up your socks and your underwear, too, don't you?
[00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:58.050]  Or do you?
[00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.611]  I don't know.
[00:27:59.891 --> 00:28:02.593]  I never gave it much thought, but I guess I do, now that I think of it.
[00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:05.696]  You deposit them in the appropriate... Put them wherever they go.
[00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:11.040]  Now, did the New York Military Academy do that for you, or were you always like that?
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:16.485]  I think, and maybe this is a part of the book and what's happening, I think that people tend to be what they are.
[00:28:16.565 --> 00:28:20.848]  If a person's neat, if a person's orderly, they tend to be that way throughout a life.
[00:28:20.888 --> 00:28:21.589]  And if they're not,
[00:28:22.308 --> 00:28:23.149]  They tend not to be.
[00:28:23.189 --> 00:28:28.293]  I've always been pretty neat and pretty orderly and pretty well adjusted from that standpoint.
[00:28:28.313 --> 00:28:38.402]  So I've had a good training, but I really believe that in many cases, and perhaps that's not a good example, but in many cases people really have it or they don't have it.
[00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:40.624]  And that's what I'm trying to get through to an extent in the book.
[00:28:41.796 --> 00:28:51.462]  Your mother is of Scottish by birth, and you tell us here, I must say, there is some personal information in here.
[00:28:51.623 --> 00:28:53.444]  Not a lot, but it's an interesting look.
[00:28:53.464 --> 00:28:55.445]  I like to, you know, leave it out as much as possible.
[00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:57.026]  Well, that's getting more and more difficult.
[00:28:57.126 --> 00:29:00.508]  If you're going to be worth a billion dollars, you've got to start answering some questions here.
[00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:05.431]  Your mother watched the coronation, didn't she, of Queen Elizabeth?
[00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:06.192]  I guess, yes.
[00:29:06.212 --> 00:29:07.112]  53, I think.
[00:29:07.172 --> 00:29:07.913]  Somewhere in there at all.
[00:29:10.126 --> 00:29:12.128]  And your father said, for God's sake, what are you doing?
[00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:14.471]  She just sat in front of that set all day, didn't she?
[00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:17.775]  Watching them pump and... She's really a wonderful woman and she's got...
[00:29:18.422 --> 00:29:33.569]  The little showbiz, and perhaps that's... I mean, I was obviously very young, but just in thinking back, I believe that whatever I have in terms of the dramatic, whether it's a Trump Tower, or doing a Trump Park, or the hotels, or whatever it might be, I think I've gotten a lot of that from my mother, actually.
[00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:40.312]  And my father is a very strong, solid meat-and-potatoes guy that... Excuse me, where are you in this shot there?
[00:29:40.332 --> 00:29:41.032]  Is that you with the hair?
[00:29:41.052 --> 00:29:41.553]  I'm on the left.
[00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:43.093]  All the way on the left?
[00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:43.954]  Yes, I'm on the left.
[00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:45.907]  Go ahead, you were saying?
[00:29:46.247 --> 00:29:48.770]  So my father's a little bit different type.
[00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:54.555]  He gets things done and quickly and all, but he's less, perhaps less promotionally oriented.
[00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:56.537]  So it's a good combination, I think.
[00:29:56.637 --> 00:30:00.881]  Getting, if you get the best traits of both, that's a really good combination.
[00:30:02.143 --> 00:30:02.383]  I hope.
[00:30:02.983 --> 00:30:03.184]  You...
[00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:16.961]  Your father was, was there a lawsuit, you didn't have enough black, or he didn't have enough blacks in his project, there were blacks in his housing development, but the, the federal government, and that upset you.
[00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:26.806]  I didn't like it because it wasn't fact, and I decided to fight it, and this was a lawsuit against numerous landlords in New York many, many years ago, and I didn't like it because it wasn't true.
[00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:34.649]  In fact, in one building they went, and there was a preponderance of blacks as opposed to whites, and I remember being asked a question, the question was asked about people,
[00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:36.450]  How many blacks do you have?
[00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.772]  And we said some huge number like 70% or 65% and they almost fell off the chair.
[00:30:42.792 --> 00:30:45.173]  Here they are suing us and we're saying a certain number.
[00:30:45.193 --> 00:30:46.034]  We've never discriminated.
[00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:46.894]  We don't believe in it.
[00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:50.596]  And I just thought on a principal ground I should fight.
[00:30:50.656 --> 00:30:51.716]  And other landlords didn't.
[00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:54.077]  And we settled and it worked out very well.
[00:30:54.237 --> 00:30:58.980]  One of the people you meet at Le Club, I gotta get to this place, was Roy Cohn.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.020]  May he rest in peace.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.120]  You liked him.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.621]  He was feisty.
[00:31:02.421 --> 00:31:05.224]  I liked Roy from the standpoint that he was a very loyal guy.
[00:31:05.284 --> 00:31:08.548]  When you see things happening nowadays, you see very little loyalty.
[00:31:08.928 --> 00:31:12.773]  You see an Ed Koch leaving everybody that gets in trouble in New York immediately.
[00:31:12.813 --> 00:31:13.934]  He doesn't know his commissioners.
[00:31:13.974 --> 00:31:15.155]  He doesn't know Bess Meyerson.
[00:31:15.175 --> 00:31:16.076]  He doesn't know anybody.
[00:31:16.116 --> 00:31:17.117]  He doesn't want to know about it.
[00:31:17.138 --> 00:31:19.040]  You know, he just drops them like they never existed.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:25.944]  The one thing I'll say about Roy is he was an extremely loyal guy, and he was a very unusual guy in that respect.
[00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:28.585]  So he was loyal, and loyalty is a great trait.
[00:31:28.765 --> 00:31:30.146]  In my opinion, it's a great trait.
[00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:33.188]  It's a trait that maybe can cause problems, but it's also a great trait.
[00:31:34.008 --> 00:31:34.108]  Right.
[00:31:34.148 --> 00:31:43.693]  Well, this is interesting because, as you know, you're the Fat Cat developer, and you know the book on you is that you throw little old ladies who can't afford the rent out of the apartment.
[00:31:45.839 --> 00:31:48.382]  I don't think that's the book on me, if you want to know.
[00:31:48.622 --> 00:31:49.563]  I don't think it is at all.
[00:31:49.603 --> 00:31:51.225]  I think probably it's just the opposite.
[00:31:52.206 --> 00:31:54.768]  We have very wealthy people in this particular building.
[00:31:54.808 --> 00:31:57.130]  We have a building on 100 Central Park South.
[00:31:57.211 --> 00:31:59.473]  Probably the best piece of real estate in New York, in the world.
[00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:03.952]  And we have very wealthy people, extremely wealthy people living in this building.
[00:32:03.992 --> 00:32:07.394]  Well, it's not quite accurate to say that every occupant is an extremely wealthy person.
[00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:09.314]  No, but the ones that were complaining were the wealthy ones.
[00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:11.255]  The ones that were complaining, Phil, were the wealthy ones.
[00:32:11.315 --> 00:32:12.976]  These are people with a lot of money.
[00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:18.378]  One of them owns a brownstone, a number of brownstones on East 66th Street, and yet she's living in this building for a rent-controlled rent.
[00:32:18.418 --> 00:32:22.059]  The rent-controlled people, the people that need rent control, they're not the ones that are protected.
[00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:26.441]  It's people that are usually wealthy with a lot of influence that have the connections to get a rent-controlled apartment.
[00:32:26.973 --> 00:32:29.887]  People that might need it, they don't have rent control apartments.
[00:32:31.602 --> 00:32:32.783]  Well, that's a little facile.
[00:32:32.863 --> 00:32:36.925]  I mean, that's a little bit like saying, you know, those people are out of work because they're lazy.
[00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:38.545]  No, it's not.
[00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:42.527]  Well, first of all, the building on Central Park South has been settled.
[00:32:42.547 --> 00:32:45.289]  You own it, and you've made your deal with all the residents.
[00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:46.369]  We're very happy with it.
[00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.989]  Score one for you.
[00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:48.810]  Very happy with it.
[00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.571]  Back to this lawsuit.
[00:32:50.591 --> 00:32:53.352]  So you hire Roy Cohn, and he goes to work, and you win it.
[00:32:54.213 --> 00:32:58.355]  Cohn doesn't like lawyers either, because they always want to settle, and you don't like that about lawyers.
[00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:00.516]  The idea of settling drove me crazy.
[00:33:00.556 --> 00:33:02.797]  The fact was that we did rent to blacks in our buildings.
[00:33:02.857 --> 00:33:06.058]  What we didn't do was rent to welfare cases, white or black.
[00:33:06.638 --> 00:33:13.721]  I'd watched what happened when the government came after Samuel Lafrak, another builder, and he caved in and started taking welfare cases.
[00:33:14.021 --> 00:33:16.041]  They virtually ruined his buildings.
[00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:22.664]  Um... Welfare cases ruined his buildings.
[00:33:23.442 --> 00:33:34.402]  Isn't that... aren't you pretty close here to looking like an insensitive guy from atop your Trump Tower looking down on the woman rank over the vast holdings of your own empire?
[00:33:35.493 --> 00:33:42.897]  Shouldn't we have just a little more understanding from a man of your influence and wealth on the issue of making New York livable for all of us?
[00:33:42.977 --> 00:33:45.238]  Safety on the subway, these kind of... Absolutely.
[00:33:45.278 --> 00:33:51.662]  If the answer is absolutely, then we can't continue to give you guys these big tax breaks.
[00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:54.723]  And that would go for General Electric and NBC, too.
[00:33:55.143 --> 00:33:58.125]  You tell us in your own book that you would make money.
[00:33:58.872 --> 00:34:03.214]  Uh, on the Trump Tower, in New York, without the tax breaks.
[00:34:03.254 --> 00:34:12.018]  When everybody else in the city gets it but Donald Trump, when Koch and the administration tries to stop Donald Trump, and I don't say give me the tax breaks, I say don't give everyone else the tax breaks.
[00:34:12.378 --> 00:34:22.922]  If every other building being built in New York City is entitled to a residential tax abatement, and Trump Tower goes, and I'm not entitled, I'm the only building in the city of New York that's not entitled, I don't think that's a problem.
[00:34:22.982 --> 00:34:24.503]  Look at the location of your building.
[00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:26.604]  Well, it makes plenty of difference.
[00:34:26.684 --> 00:34:30.125]  Phil, there are other wonderful locations also that are also getting tax abatements.
[00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:31.365]  I won the case.
[00:34:31.405 --> 00:34:32.265]  They didn't give it to me.
[00:34:32.305 --> 00:34:33.806]  It took me two and a half years in court.
[00:34:33.846 --> 00:34:36.827]  I won it seven to nothing in three different courts, and I'm very happy about it.
[00:34:37.207 --> 00:34:42.348]  I didn't win it because I so much needed it as much as because, on a moral principle, I was entitled to it.
[00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:44.949]  If nobody's gonna get it, I'm satisfied.
[00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:48.130]  If everybody's gonna get it, I shouldn't be the only one that's not getting it, Phil.
[00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.531]  And I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't take it either.
[00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:53.512]  If you were in my position, you wouldn't take that.
[00:34:53.972 --> 00:34:55.073]  So, that's what happened.
[00:34:55.093 --> 00:35:00.258]  Hey, let's hear it for the rich folk!
[00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:09.888]  But you tell us also in your book, you left Queens and you left Brooklyn for Manhattan.
[00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:14.787]  No, I'm honest.
[00:35:14.807 --> 00:35:17.168]  Hey, I'm not running for anything, Phil.
[00:35:17.188 --> 00:35:18.129]  I'm not running for office.
[00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:19.750]  I don't have to lie in a book.
[00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.111]  I want to tell the facts, okay?
[00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:43.266]  I think you know it as well as anybody else.
[00:35:43.807 --> 00:35:47.390]  Rent control, and I'm one of the few developers in the world that would ever say it.
[00:35:48.011 --> 00:35:50.473]  Some forms of rent control are sometimes necessary.
[00:35:50.834 --> 00:35:53.937]  To protect the elderly, to protect people that truly don't have the money.
[00:35:54.217 --> 00:35:57.220]  But when you have multi-millionaires, and not all instances of this.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.666]  Phil, there's not all instances, but you go to Manhattan, the prime sections of Manhattan, where you have rent control and rent stabilization all over.
[00:36:04.318 --> 00:36:09.845]  Those are wealthy people in many instances, and I don't mean every instance, Phil, but I mean in many, and I would say in a majority.
[00:36:10.405 --> 00:36:17.714]  You have multi-millionaires, in some cases, living in apartments for $200, $300, and $500 a month that should be paying many times.
[00:36:17.734 --> 00:36:20.878]  This is going to sound a little unusual, but New York rents can be $10,000 and $20,000 a month.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.460]  What does that mean?
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.541]  What does that mean, Phil?
[00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:33.383]  That means that the city can't tax, because if a wealthy person's paying $300 a month, you can't really tax that beyond a certain point, 20% of that or whatever it might be.
[00:36:33.783 --> 00:36:35.304]  So the city's always short of funds.
[00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:36.864]  It's a joke what's happened.
[00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:41.785]  And the people that need rent control, and there are some indeed, those aren't the people that have it.
[00:36:42.126 --> 00:36:43.426]  It's the people with the connections.
[00:36:43.726 --> 00:36:44.706]  Somebody knows Trump.
[00:36:45.026 --> 00:36:46.207]  Somebody knows somebody else.
[00:36:46.227 --> 00:36:48.007]  They call up, they say, do me a favor.
[00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:49.208]  That's what it's all about.
[00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.674]  The Saudis wants to get in here.
[00:36:52.955 --> 00:36:55.464]  Mr. Trump, sir, if your position is...
[00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.065]  Let's grant a given.
[00:36:59.446 --> 00:37:00.106]  No doubt about it.
[00:37:00.526 --> 00:37:05.127]  Under rent control circumstances, there are going to be certain people who don't need it who get it.
[00:37:05.607 --> 00:37:06.967]  Not unlike Social Security.
[00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:09.768]  There are going to be some people who get it who don't need it.
[00:37:10.248 --> 00:37:19.530]  But to suggest that rent control is somehow being pervasively abused throughout the island of Manhattan by people who don't need it, I do have plenty of doubt.
[00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.851]  Well, you ought to check the numbers, Phil.
[00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:21.991]  I mean, I can tell you something.
[00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:23.051]  Now, one little thing.
[00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:24.592]  All I'm asking for is a simple thing.
[00:37:24.952 --> 00:37:25.812]  Give a means test.
[00:37:26.312 --> 00:37:42.325]  If a person makes $150,000 a year working in a big advertising agency, if a person makes $200,000, $300,000, $100,000, $75,000 a year, let there be a means test so that that person will give the apartment to somebody that can afford it if you have to do that for them.
[00:37:42.365 --> 00:37:43.646]  Why can't there be a means test?
[00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:47.550]  Why should multi-millionaires live for $300 or $400 a month when poor people
[00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.771]  We're good to go.
[00:38:06.981 --> 00:38:12.243]  Emptied and made available to people that need really this protection.
[00:38:12.603 --> 00:38:14.983]  The apartments occupied by very wealthy people.
[00:38:15.524 --> 00:38:18.224]  In New York, you're talking about tremendous amounts of money.
[00:38:18.244 --> 00:38:23.886]  And I mean, if you're talking about a number of accountants in order to administrate a program, you're not talking about a lot relative to what we're talking.
[00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.606]  We got a lot, just a couple more things I want to get in.
[00:38:25.626 --> 00:38:27.487]  Let's see if we can briefly touch on some of these things.
[00:38:28.248 --> 00:38:30.391]  You should not have called Mayor Koch a moron.
[00:38:30.551 --> 00:38:32.273]  That was not good public relations.
[00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:34.296]  Hey, what can I do?
[00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:37.421]  Well, doesn't it... isn't this... aren't you a little... don't you want to take this back at all?
[00:38:37.441 --> 00:38:38.662]  I don't think it's bad public relations.
[00:38:38.703 --> 00:38:39.524]  No, I don't take it back.
[00:38:39.644 --> 00:38:42.308]  When it comes to running the city, he's about as bad as anybody I've seen.
[00:38:43.058 --> 00:38:45.279]  Ed Koch has been a disaster for New York.
[00:38:45.379 --> 00:38:47.100]  People that live in New York understand it.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.440]  Taxes have gone through the roof.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.481]  Everything's gone through.
[00:38:49.521 --> 00:38:58.564]  You have, whether it's a wallman rink or a subway system, whether it's a school that comes in and takes eight or nine years... Excuse me, but here you are with your folks at City Hall getting your picture taken.
[00:38:58.584 --> 00:38:59.384]  Those are good old days?
[00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:00.805]  Well, I guess you liked me in those days.
[00:39:01.165 --> 00:39:08.788]  No, I just think that, and this is, and I don't think you have to be passionately committed to City Hall or anybody
[00:39:10.217 --> 00:39:17.582]  To conclude that this kind of language from someone of your power and influence is not good style.
[00:39:18.443 --> 00:39:20.845]  Phil, from my standpoint, it doesn't really matter.
[00:39:20.945 --> 00:39:22.366]  Again, I'm not running for office.
[00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:25.688]  If the point is made better by saying that, let the point be made.
[00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:27.369]  He's done a lousy job as the mayor.
[00:39:27.529 --> 00:39:30.071]  Anybody from New York probably understands it and knows it.
[00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:33.253]  It's gone down now and it's going down as the most corrupt
[00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:38.470]  Hey Phil, this is the most corrupt administration in the history of the city.
[00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.532]  They have their problem.
[00:39:43.592 --> 00:39:46.833]  I have here a collection of some of your quotes from Newsweek.
[00:39:46.893 --> 00:39:49.514]  I'm happy to give them credit.
[00:39:49.794 --> 00:39:53.055]  On his enemies, if people screw me, I screw back in spades.
[00:39:57.034 --> 00:39:58.535]  I mean, is there something wrong with that?
[00:39:58.555 --> 00:39:59.035]  Tell me.
[00:39:59.255 --> 00:40:01.097]  Phil, is there something wrong with that?
[00:40:01.637 --> 00:40:08.121]  Well, a confrontational kind of, I'll get you, you son of a... Let me give you a little example, if I can.
[00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:09.102]  Let me give you an example.
[00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:14.405]  This country, as I walked into this room today, the stock market was down 75 points, okay?
[00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:16.886]  We should say that we're taping on November 30th.
[00:40:16.946 --> 00:40:19.128]  We're gonna scare the life out of people who watch this.
[00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.275]  We are taping on the last day of November in 1987, sir.
[00:40:23.355 --> 00:40:24.517]  There's a lot of problems.
[00:40:24.577 --> 00:40:28.222]  You had Black Monday, you have the catastrophe of a 500-day fall.
[00:40:28.523 --> 00:40:30.105]  Let me just give you one little example.
[00:40:30.709 --> 00:40:33.571]  We have countries out there that are so-called allies.
[00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:36.674]  And I use the word so-called because they're a disaster for this country.
[00:40:36.714 --> 00:40:38.535]  Japan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait.
[00:40:38.815 --> 00:40:45.761]  They're making billions and trillions of dollars while this country is going out and borrowing money from Japan in order to defend Japan.
[00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:47.082]  They don't spend for defense.
[00:40:47.142 --> 00:40:48.143]  We defend Japan.
[00:40:48.203 --> 00:40:49.424]  We get oil into Kuwait.
[00:40:49.444 --> 00:40:52.026]  Then they go out and they buy 10% of British petroleum.
[00:40:52.726 --> 00:40:54.187]  I'll tell you what... I think they ought to...
[00:40:55.612 --> 00:41:00.493]  Increase their defense spending a hundredfold, and their economy will collapse just like ours has.
[00:41:00.893 --> 00:41:05.834]  That Japan may just... Wasn't Japan a partner in your TV City project?
[00:41:05.974 --> 00:41:07.915]  Japan wanted to be a partner.
[00:41:08.155 --> 00:41:08.415]  25%, right?
[00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:09.335]  They want to buy it.
[00:41:09.395 --> 00:41:10.175]  They want to buy everything.
[00:41:10.195 --> 00:41:10.455]  Hey!
[00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:17.537]  For 20 years they've taken money out, and now they're coming back because of a low dollar, caused to a large extent by them, and they want to put it back in.
[00:41:17.717 --> 00:41:19.998]  You had a $100 million deal with the Japanese.
[00:41:20.038 --> 00:41:20.679]  You went back to them.
[00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:22.860]  You said, you're changing the price to $160 million.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.641]  They said, we're out of this.
[00:41:24.901 --> 00:41:26.602]  You went back to them and said, OK, $100 million.
[00:41:26.622 --> 00:41:27.982]  They said, we don't want to deal with it.
[00:41:28.002 --> 00:41:28.322]  Tell me wrong.
[00:41:28.342 --> 00:41:28.963]  Where did you read this?
[00:41:28.983 --> 00:41:29.823]  You read the newspapers.
[00:41:29.843 --> 00:41:30.444]  You believe the newspapers.
[00:41:30.464 --> 00:41:31.064]  That must be true.
[00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:32.365]  I read it in the New York Post.
[00:41:32.425 --> 00:41:33.165]  Well, OK.
[00:41:34.654 --> 00:41:36.876]  Um, I thought that maybe is the case.
[00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:39.398]  Is it not true that you lost a Japanese partnership?
[00:41:39.438 --> 00:41:39.959]  I didn't lose anybody.
[00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:41.880]  Hey, nobody does a lot more business than me.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.181]  Phil, let me just explain something.
[00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:44.382]  I build luxury apartments.
[00:41:44.463 --> 00:41:49.247]  We sold an apartment to a Japanese gentleman, a number of apartments, for 21 million dollars.
[00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:49.547]  Right.
[00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:52.871]  I've sold other apartments for lots of money to the Japanese.
[00:41:52.951 --> 00:41:53.812]  Some of my best friends.
[00:41:54.753 --> 00:42:02.319]  I just say, and I respect the Japanese, but they have taken tremendous advantage of the United States, folks, in case anybody doesn't understand.
[00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:03.319]  And what do you want them to do?
[00:42:03.339 --> 00:42:03.980]  What do I want them to do?
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.703]  I want us to be represented in such a way that we can compete with Japan.
[00:42:08.203 --> 00:42:11.587]  They've taken the money out for 20 years, and now they're buying it back in.
[00:42:11.727 --> 00:42:16.332]  So what they did is they took it out, and now they're coming in trying to buy all of Manhattan, trying to buy anything.
[00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:19.235]  And Phil, I don't like being taken advantage of, okay?
[00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:24.181]  On Michael Dukakis and the other Democratic presidential candidates, Americans are tired of the Seven Dwarfs.
[00:42:26.123 --> 00:42:28.486]  On Leona Helmsley, I feel sorry for Harry.
[00:42:33.323 --> 00:42:36.845]  On Trump, there is no one my age who has accomplished more.
[00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:39.386]  Everyone can't be the best.
[00:42:40.227 --> 00:42:40.927]  Did I say that?
[00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:42.087]  That's what it says here.
[00:42:42.147 --> 00:42:42.648]  Oh, forget it.
[00:42:42.728 --> 00:42:43.348]  Don't believe it.
[00:42:43.548 --> 00:42:44.989]  And we'll be back in just a moment.
[00:42:45.049 --> 00:42:45.429]  Don't believe it.
[00:43:00.298 --> 00:43:05.421]  ...to accommodate something like 17 people, or 14, or he has a couple of bedrooms, does he?
[00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:07.442]  This is getting to be an embarrassing problem.
[00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:10.705]  And you've also got a yacht.
[00:43:11.325 --> 00:43:14.147]  I forget the number, the price on that.
[00:43:15.988 --> 00:43:17.069]  We wanted to get something back.
[00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.549]  Hey, Phil.
[00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:18.530]  Are you happy?
[00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.571]  Well, I'm happy.
[00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:24.034]  I mean, I wanted to get something back from Saudi Arabia, so I got one of their yachts, you know.
[00:43:24.114 --> 00:43:24.935]  It's about time.
[00:43:25.555 --> 00:43:26.295]  We should do more of it.
[00:43:28.254 --> 00:43:29.435]  Everybody's getting from us.
[00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:50.770]  Now, NBC is not, is not apparently going to, in any agreement with you on the terms of its occupancy of Television City, a 150-story building which you want to construct on the Hudson River.
[00:43:51.271 --> 00:43:55.634]  It would, if you completed this project, be the tallest building in the world.
[00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.167]  Wouldn't that be a great thing for New York?
[00:43:58.707 --> 00:44:00.789]  I mean, you left Chicago, in all fairness, Phil.
[00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:03.311]  So, I mean, shouldn't New York have maybe the world's tallest building?
[00:44:03.331 --> 00:44:04.892]  Wouldn't that be a nice thing for New York, Phil?
[00:44:05.332 --> 00:44:06.834]  Uh, well, it depends.
[00:44:06.874 --> 00:44:09.236]  For those of us that are proud of New York, or used to be at least?
[00:44:09.256 --> 00:44:14.100]  Well, how much tax abatement is it going to take to build Television City?
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.283]  How will it contribute to the long-term well-being of the city?
[00:44:18.743 --> 00:44:20.365]  What money's not given?
[00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:27.247]  How will the tax money not forthcoming to the city till influence people who are not of wealth?
[00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:29.047]  All these are pretty important questions.
[00:44:29.067 --> 00:44:31.468]  Why do you say I'm asking for tax abatement on the world's tallest building?
[00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:32.748]  I'm not asking for tax abatement.
[00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:34.329]  You assume I'm asking for tax abatement.
[00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:35.629]  You're not asking for any tax abatement?
[00:44:35.649 --> 00:44:37.870]  No, I'm not asking for tax abatement on the world's tallest building.
[00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:41.011]  And, you know, not every job has to have tax abatement, Phil.
[00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:44.191]  That's one that, hey, if they want to give it to me, I'd love to take it.
[00:44:44.411 --> 00:44:47.932]  But, to be perfectly honest, I'm not asking for tax abatement on the world's tallest building.
[00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:49.973]  Well, in what language... See, you're on the assumption that
[00:44:50.649 --> 00:44:52.432]  Everything I do, I'm looking for an edge.
[00:44:52.573 --> 00:44:54.255]  And that's not necessarily correct.
[00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:56.800]  It's usually correct, but it's not necessarily correct.
[00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.771]  Well, what is the status of that deal?
[00:44:59.811 --> 00:45:01.332]  You and NBC have broken off talks.
[00:45:01.352 --> 00:45:03.213]  Now, NBC, the process is going to be too long.
[00:45:03.253 --> 00:45:04.614]  I'm going for zoning on the west side.
[00:45:04.634 --> 00:45:09.436]  It's a fabulous parcel of land on the west side of Manhattan, fronting the water from 72nd to 59th Street.
[00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.417]  And I'm going for zoning.
[00:45:10.937 --> 00:45:12.838]  New York City is a very cumbersome process.
[00:45:12.858 --> 00:45:13.498]  This is number 30.
[00:45:13.538 --> 00:45:14.619]  I think we have a shot.
[00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:15.039]  There it is.
[00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.419]  There it is.
[00:45:15.739 --> 00:45:22.123]  This 100 acres, think about this, on Manhattan Island, that's the Hudson River.
[00:45:22.943 --> 00:45:24.364]  Now, what do you want
[00:45:25.286 --> 00:45:26.848]  What shall we do with this property?
[00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:28.170]  And who shall decide?
[00:45:30.113 --> 00:45:32.315]  And who will live there?
[00:45:32.436 --> 00:45:33.397]  Who will work there?
[00:45:33.998 --> 00:45:34.939]  Where will they park?
[00:45:37.797 --> 00:45:38.798]  And how, what?
[00:45:39.118 --> 00:45:43.642]  How are they going to get into the Broadway and and 72nd Street subway station?
[00:45:43.662 --> 00:45:44.283]  Well, they're not.
[00:45:44.323 --> 00:45:47.445]  It's going to be a great big empty building and nobody's going to be able to get to this thing.
[00:45:47.866 --> 00:45:52.329]  What, just very briefly, what, tell us what is, uh, what is the status of this?
[00:45:52.670 --> 00:46:03.679]  It's going through a long process that New York City, in New York City when you build something you have to go through a very agonizing long process and it's a process that's putting New York frankly at a great disadvantage with other cities because
[00:46:04.279 --> 00:46:07.443]  If you want to put something up, it could take years and years before you do it.
[00:46:07.463 --> 00:46:12.309]  We're toward the middle, maybe even rounding the corner on the end of that process.
[00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:15.712]  And I guess over the next period of a year, hopefully it'll be ready.
[00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:19.657]  And if not, I'll just sit back and wait till perhaps a more progressive administration comes in.
[00:46:19.697 --> 00:46:20.298]  I'm not sure.
[00:46:20.418 --> 00:46:21.219]  I may have to do that.
[00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:22.100]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.181]  What charities do you benefit?
[00:46:43.453 --> 00:46:49.120]  Well, I give a lot of money to charity, and more and more so, and I think that I'm going to be doing more in the future.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.382]  I gave a lot of money to the Vietnam Veterans.
[00:46:51.402 --> 00:46:53.445]  You remember the big parade in New York?
[00:46:53.885 --> 00:46:58.511]  I gave a million dollars toward that on a matching grant a year and a half ago, whenever it was.
[00:46:59.171 --> 00:47:16.123]  And I think if you asked any Vietnam vet what they think of Donald Trump I think they'd think I hate to be talking about it to be perfectly honest because I don't like to be bragging that I gave a million dollars last year to the Vietnam vet and vets and it's not really my style and perhaps Phil and other people wouldn't like it even for my image because it's not the image that they want to project.
[00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:23.609]  All right, folks, you are watching the live broadcast here from InfoWars, the second night of the Democratic National Catastrophe.
[00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.691]  And it's getting spicy out there, folks.
[00:47:25.711 --> 00:47:31.576]  We've got clashes between police and protesters breaking out outside of the convention center.
[00:47:32.076 --> 00:47:38.582]  Strangely enough, nobody wanted to go to the designated free speech zone in a park a mile away from the convention center.
[00:47:39.252 --> 00:47:46.817]  No, they all decided they would rather be right out in front or in front of the Israeli consulate, which is where I believe this stream is coming from.
[00:47:47.558 --> 00:47:51.581]  So, massive protests as expected during the DNC.
[00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:54.883]  Huge catastrophe.
[00:47:54.903 --> 00:47:56.824]  It's just a gigantic catastrophe.
[00:47:56.864 --> 00:47:58.366]  Again, Alex Jones will be joining us a little bit later.
[00:47:58.686 --> 00:48:00.127]  Chase Geiser joining us a little bit later.
[00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:03.429]  They're just doing the roll call of states right now.
[00:48:03.669 --> 00:48:08.713]  There's some questions about this, and I'll answer those in just a second.
[00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:16.607]  Yes, apparently hundreds of Chicago police in riot gear are currently clashing with pro-Palestine protesters, along with other activists.
[00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:23.309]  Things extremely tense right now, according to people on the ground there at the DNC.
[00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.530]  So yeah, folks.
[00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:33.693]  Abortions in the back, riots in the front, and in the middle, a big gay dance party pretending to participate in the political process.
[00:48:34.513 --> 00:48:36.414]  And this is a common theme with the Democrats.
[00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:40.197]  I mean, the Democrats are sort of on the forefront of this.
[00:48:42.078 --> 00:48:48.403]  But I also think maybe it's just a natural process of political capture that's going on.
[00:48:50.404 --> 00:48:55.808]  That you have these holdovers of a time where our process worked correctly.
[00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:58.810]  And there's like, there's like a term for this.
[00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.333]  It's like, you know, words that are still used but not with their original meaning.
[00:49:03.866 --> 00:49:10.728]  You know, it's like we're a religion and we keep doing the ceremony, but we don't understand what it means anymore.
[00:49:11.188 --> 00:49:12.308]  We don't know why we're doing it.
[00:49:12.348 --> 00:49:15.809]  We just know, you know, here's sort of the steps that we're supposed to take.
[00:49:16.269 --> 00:49:22.811]  At one point, somebody knew what this was all supposed to be, supposed to mean, but we lost that long ago.
[00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:27.693]  See, the convention used to be where you would elect and nominate your candidate.
[00:49:27.953 --> 00:49:32.234]  It was a time for wheeling and dealing, for, you know, assigning delegates.
[00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:36.476]  Usually this is preceded by a primary of some sort.
[00:49:37.677 --> 00:49:38.837]  That's not the case anymore.
[00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:43.519]  This, in particular, this convention is different for that exact reason.
[00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:45.820]  That it's all just a show.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.960]  It's all just play acting.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.903]  It's all just doing the ceremony without actually understanding what the purpose of the ceremony is.
[00:49:52.963 --> 00:49:59.906]  See, in reality, the wheeling and dealing, the decisions had already been made long before anybody got to Chicago.
[00:50:00.746 --> 00:50:09.435]  And as they're doing the roll call now with the delegates pledging to people, this had all already been decided months ago with a virtual convention.
[00:50:10.851 --> 00:50:34.627]  So like they're still doing the convention it just is now it's just like a big gay dance party where everything's preordained and already decided but the people get to pretend like they're participating in the democratic process they get to pretend like they're active and involved in the political decisions being made but the political decisions being made were already made in a boardroom somewhere three months ago and now they're just acting they're just pretending they're doing all of the motions and
[00:50:35.948 --> 00:50:40.532]  The ceremony is going forward, but it means nothing and is completely arbitrary.
[00:50:40.712 --> 00:50:41.793]  Kind of like January 6th.
[00:50:42.874 --> 00:50:52.863]  You know, January 6th, the reason people were meeting there was to determine whether or not to count the votes, to determine whether or not they're legitimate, whether to certify it or not.
[00:50:53.064 --> 00:50:54.445]  See, there's a purpose of going there.
[00:50:55.286 --> 00:51:00.150]  Now, you know, January 6th and the riot, they decided that, you know, we're not going to do that anymore.
[00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.451]  We're still going to meet on January 6th.
[00:51:02.552 --> 00:51:05.734]  It's just not going to be an option to certify or not certify the election anymore.
[00:51:05.814 --> 00:51:07.396]  It will be certified every time.
[00:51:07.756 --> 00:51:23.927]  So, you know, slowly but surely, it's like we're still doing the things that make us seem like we're a republic or that we have democratic participation, but more and more, the actual purpose of these events and the intentions behind them and the reason that they happened in the first place are no longer applicable.
[00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:26.329]  It's not actually a thing anymore.
[00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.091]  So I can see it in the future where it's like,
[00:51:30.202 --> 00:51:34.144]  I mean, I can see them holding a primary where there's only one candidate, right?
[00:51:34.164 --> 00:51:44.110]  People go, well, wait, why is it exactly that our presidential candidate travels from state to state in this particular order ahead of the, you know, general election?
[00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:53.895]  And we'll be like, well, once back in the day, it used to be an option to vote for multiple people, and you'd have candidates vying for the position, and the primaries would decide that.
[00:51:54.295 --> 00:51:58.698]  Now, you know, some suit on Wall Street determines who are
[00:51:59.844 --> 00:52:21.891]  Candidate is and but they still go through they still you know we still do the convention and we still do the primaries but it's all decided already and you can go and pretend to vote and that's kind of fun you know to act like you still have a say in the in the function of your government but you know it's all just it's all arbitrary it's all decided from on high we all just get propagandized into supporting whoever they put out in front of us
[00:52:22.844 --> 00:52:24.968]  Like we're hungry dogs presented a treat.
[00:52:25.229 --> 00:52:28.395]  We don't think about it or consider whether it's good for us.
[00:52:29.117 --> 00:52:32.464]  We just wolf it down and pretend it was our choice.
[00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:33.867]  We pretend we had a say in this.
[00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:38.090]  It's just pathetic.
[00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.110]  It honestly is pathetic.
[00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:42.553]  And of course, you can just look back at 2016 to realize why they wouldn't want this system anymore.
[00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:46.156]  2016, I mean, they had to... It was, like, embarrassing for them.
[00:52:46.176 --> 00:52:50.040]  Remember, they had to, like, have sound machines to drown out the Bernie protesters?
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:57.526]  Like, during Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech, people were, like, shouting things out, and the Clinton people had to chant to overwhelm them.
[00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:02.030]  Like, it was very obvious, very apparent, the cover-up, the manipulation, the machinations.
[00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.191]  Remember, uh, what's it, Wasserman Schultz?
[00:53:05.012 --> 00:53:20.642]  Had to drop out, had to resign as leader of the DNC because it was revealed that she had worked behind the scenes to squander Bernie Sanders, to shut him out and to guarantee Hillary Clinton would be the nominee.
[00:53:21.403 --> 00:53:28.328]  So it's like, it's been at least since 2016, I mean before that as well, but like at least in 2016 there was a very obvious and
[00:53:29.935 --> 00:53:32.719]  Relevant and just for everybody to see.
[00:53:32.739 --> 00:53:33.419]  It was just out there.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:44.493]  A very obvious takeover by the corporate controllers of the Democratic Party in opposition to the desires of the average Democratic people, which seemed to
[00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:49.949]  I prefer Bernie, but see back then they had to like do all this stuff.
[00:53:50.009 --> 00:53:51.270]  They had to cover it up.
[00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.411]  They had to wheel and deal.
[00:53:52.431 --> 00:53:53.751]  They had to do all the stuff behind the scenes.
[00:53:54.172 --> 00:53:54.812]  That was messy.
[00:53:54.852 --> 00:53:55.673]  It was embarrassing.
[00:53:55.713 --> 00:53:56.373]  We all saw it.
[00:53:56.893 --> 00:54:02.477]  Now it's all done behind the scenes and the DNC as it exists now is just a party.
[00:54:02.517 --> 00:54:03.678]  It's just a dance party.
[00:54:04.693 --> 00:54:20.157]  And everybody there gets to pretend that they're involved in the political process while changing nothing, affecting nothing, and being slavishly devoted to the shadowy masters who actually decide who their nominee is.
[00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:33.321]  One of the videos that I see going around Twitter that people are confused about is the fact that California decided to pass its delegate pledge, and people are
[00:54:34.974 --> 00:54:38.016]  Freaking out about this and what the heck is California holding up?
[00:54:38.716 --> 00:54:43.879]  Are Californian Democrats actually rebelling against the fraudulent nature of this convention?
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:56.407]  Are they standing up against the nomination of a person that nobody voted for with a total lack of primaries and really just despotic takeover of their party?
[00:54:56.487 --> 00:54:57.548]  No, obviously not.
[00:54:57.568 --> 00:54:58.629]  This was a pre-planned thing.
[00:54:59.448 --> 00:55:04.930]  This is, again, just another stage-managed charade that they're doing.
[00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:12.352]  So for people confused, thinking that California may have just withheld its delegates from pledging to Kamala Harris, no, they're going to pledge them.
[00:55:13.773 --> 00:55:20.915]  Or they may already have at this point, but here's the video of them skipping, passing on the roll call here.
[00:55:29.921 --> 00:55:32.503]  California, how do you cast your vote?
[00:55:38.508 --> 00:55:45.013]  Mr. Secretary, the great state of California passes at this time.
[00:55:46.755 --> 00:55:47.795]  California passes.
[00:55:47.815 --> 00:55:51.819]  All right, so there's them enthusiastically passing.
[00:55:52.459 --> 00:55:53.760]  Enthusiastically not doing anything.
[00:55:54.761 --> 00:55:58.044]  And again, people posting this, and there's some weirdness with this.
[00:55:59.178 --> 00:56:02.752]  Members of our crew were like trying to repost this video and got their accounts locked.
[00:56:02.852 --> 00:56:03.535]  It's very strange.
[00:56:04.157 --> 00:56:04.679]  What's happening here?
[00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:11.578]  But it turns out this was all, again, pre-staged and stage-managed.
[00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:21.964]  Governor Gavin Newsom plans to announce on the Democratic Convention floor Tuesday the California vote that gives Kamala Harris enough delegates to once again be declared the party's presidential nominee.
[00:56:22.464 --> 00:56:27.507]  Harris is already the presidential nominee, thanks to a virtual roll call earlier this month.
[00:56:28.088 --> 00:56:31.029]  But a roll call of the states is a long-held convention tradition.
[00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:35.212]  Democrats plan to take up much of Tuesday's program with a state-by-state tally.
[00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:40.292]  They could just not do- they've already decided, they've already pledged their delegates.
[00:56:41.372 --> 00:56:45.093]  Literally, this whole time, what we're seeing now on screen is just pretend.
[00:56:45.213 --> 00:56:46.693]  Like, they're just playing pretend.
[00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:51.515]  They're pretending to pledge delegates that were pledged months ago on some Zoom call.
[00:56:52.095 --> 00:56:52.375]  Okay?
[00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:54.536]  It's wild.
[00:56:54.616 --> 00:56:58.877]  It really is wild to see this, like, what is the term?
[00:56:58.917 --> 00:57:00.517]  I'm sure somebody watching knows what I'm talking about.
[00:57:00.537 --> 00:57:03.878]  There's like a term for this, this idea where you have defunct
[00:57:05.979 --> 00:57:06.601]  Fugazi.
[00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:08.123]  No, no, not Fugazi.
[00:57:08.163 --> 00:57:08.444]  No, no.
[00:57:08.704 --> 00:57:17.160]  The idea of, like, like, you know, if there's still some governmental bureaucracy dealing with steam engines.
[00:57:17.927 --> 00:57:19.308]  And it's like, why does this still exist?
[00:57:19.889 --> 00:57:21.130]  Steam engines aren't around anymore.
[00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:22.331]  They don't, it's not a thing.
[00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:24.592]  We don't have steam engines carrying trains.
[00:57:24.632 --> 00:57:28.275]  So why is there still this holdover bureaucracy dealing with steam engines?
[00:57:28.656 --> 00:57:29.476]  It's like, it's defunct.
[00:57:29.516 --> 00:57:37.643]  The idea of people having a say in their policies, the average American getting to vote for who represents them, this is all defunct at this point.
[00:57:38.724 --> 00:57:40.045]  But they're still going through the motions.
[00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:41.606]  And, like, openly.
[00:57:41.666 --> 00:57:42.207]  Like, literally.
[00:57:42.247 --> 00:57:43.147]  Like, I'm not joking.
[00:57:44.219 --> 00:57:45.340]  This is what they're doing.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.020]  Vestigial.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.020]  Yeah, vestigial.
[00:57:47.461 --> 00:57:48.121]  That's a word for it.
[00:57:49.081 --> 00:57:49.242]  Sure.
[00:57:49.262 --> 00:57:53.824]  Yeah, they're like vestigial body parts.
[00:57:53.844 --> 00:57:55.865]  I think the appendix is a vestigial body part.
[00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:58.266]  Nobody knows what it does, but it must have done something at one point.
[00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:00.207]  Not anymore, but it's still there.
[00:58:01.247 --> 00:58:02.108]  Yes, vestigial.
[00:58:02.128 --> 00:58:04.109]  That's a very good word for it.
[00:58:04.129 --> 00:58:04.689]  Thank you, crew.
[00:58:06.343 --> 00:58:08.844]  So this convention has about 4,700 delegates.
[00:58:08.884 --> 00:58:11.945]  It takes a majority to win, which is no problem for Harris.
[00:58:11.985 --> 00:58:14.386]  The roll call usually proceeds alphabetically by state.
[00:58:14.947 --> 00:58:20.169]  It's expected that when it's California's turn, the state will pass and then later be recognized when it's time to put Harris over the top.
[00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:35.275]  So basically, because it's her home state, and because Gavin Newsom and her are bosom buddies from back in the day, they're gonna let all the other states go until, you know, they have almost enough delegates, and then California will come in to be the ones to put them over the top.
[00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:42.497]  Not that any of this matters because all the delegates were already pledged during a Zoom call months ago.
[00:58:42.778 --> 00:58:43.018]  Okay?
[00:58:43.158 --> 00:58:48.224]  So there's just where they're pretending, they're dancing, they're singing, they're castrating themselves.
[00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:49.967]  It's all a lot of fun and games.
[00:58:49.987 --> 00:58:52.009]  They're also fighting police and um...
[00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:54.030]  Burning the American flag.
[00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:59.172]  So, you know, just typical Democratic nonsense on full display at the DNC in Chicago.
[00:58:59.692 --> 00:59:02.693]  Violent clashes between the police and the protesters.
[00:59:02.953 --> 00:59:04.013]  It's just full-on dystopia.
[00:59:04.033 --> 00:59:14.736]  It's just, this is Democracy Manifest, where inside is a big, fabulous dance party with people pretending to participate in the political process and be important.
[00:59:15.441 --> 00:59:22.786]  Well, outside, a bunch of disaffected Americans are being pepper-sprayed and assaulted by the de facto police state we all now reside in.
[00:59:23.446 --> 00:59:28.170]  And in the back, there's an RV, uh, snipping people's balls off and killing babies.
[00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.011]  So it's just dystopia full-blown.
[00:59:30.631 --> 00:59:32.913]  We are in Stage 4 dystopia.
[00:59:32.953 --> 00:59:33.773]  There is no Stage 5.
[00:59:35.394 --> 00:59:37.836]  It's just this forever until we die, I guess.
[00:59:38.877 --> 00:59:43.460]  Because apparently, a portion of Americans can't see through this.
[00:59:45.285 --> 00:59:46.066]  I don't know what to tell you.
[00:59:46.506 --> 00:59:48.589]  I don't know how obvious they have to make it.
[00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:57.360]  It goes on and on and on, the amount of open, blatant deception that these people pull on the American people on a daily basis.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.485]  And yet it just goes unremarked by the vast majority of people.
[01:00:01.905 --> 01:00:03.046]  Except for you, if you're watching me.
[01:00:04.224 --> 01:00:13.029]  If you're watching InfoWars, just know you are probably one of the top 1% and most informed people in America.
[01:00:13.169 --> 01:00:14.590]  I'm not even joking, folks.
[01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.512]  Go ask a hundred people who Klaus Schwab is.
[01:00:18.452 --> 01:00:24.896]  Go ask a hundred random people on the streets of America if they've ever heard of the World Economic Forum.
[01:00:26.337 --> 01:00:27.598]  If they've ever heard of Klaus Schwab.
[01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:30.980]  If they have any idea what
[01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:34.714]  I don't know, George Soros was up too as a teenager.
[01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:38.655]  They don't, I don't know.
[01:00:38.695 --> 01:00:43.256]  The average American, frankly, doesn't know anything.
[01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:50.158]  It's upsetting and annoying, but that's how the scumbags are able to get away with everything.
[01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:50.919]  People don't know.
[01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:51.839]  They have no idea.
[01:00:53.139 --> 01:01:01.782]  And somehow there's been a program of like emotional moral degradation to where they don't care at this point anymore.
[01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:07.011]  I'm loving this two-screen setup we got going.
[01:01:07.452 --> 01:01:08.753]  We got the outside and the inside.
[01:01:09.614 --> 01:01:15.500]  The outside is clashes with police, bordering on civil war.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.922]  I don't know, some sort of marching rabbis.
[01:01:20.005 --> 01:01:22.767]  Oh, these are the anti-Zionist Jews.
[01:01:24.169 --> 01:01:24.890]  The Orthodox Jews.
[01:01:27.972 --> 01:01:30.114]  Authentic rabbis always opposed to Zionism.
[01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:33.776]  The state of Israel and its atrocities is condemned by Judaism.
[01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:35.477]  Bring the war home.
[01:01:35.678 --> 01:01:36.958]  Oh, that's pretty intense.
[01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:38.620]  That's pretty intense.
[01:01:39.961 --> 01:01:41.001]  But remember it's- Oh!
[01:01:41.842 --> 01:01:43.963]  Okay, I thought that was John Podesta for a second.
[01:01:45.104 --> 01:01:47.446]  Sorry, I thought I caught John Podesta on screen.
[01:01:49.307 --> 01:01:51.469]  It's just another creepy looking old man.
[01:01:54.159 --> 01:02:00.925]  Stephanie Grisham gave a speech today that again is going moderately viral on X. We can go to that, clip number 20.
[01:02:01.705 --> 01:02:08.070]  She is the former White House press secretary, and that's how she's being touted.
[01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:15.636]  And of course, this is being promoted by the Democrats as, you know, a Trump loyalist who just, she couldn't take it anymore.
[01:02:16.636 --> 01:02:21.500]  And she has to come clean and reveal the evil she was once involved in.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.340]  It's not true.
[01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:37.212]  She was registered as a Democrat since she started voting in 1997 and quit from Trump's administration the afternoon of January 6th, 2021 and immediately came out with a book about the affair.
[01:02:38.933 --> 01:02:41.255]  Let's go to this video.
[01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:43.076]  Again, this is Stephanie Grisham.
[01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:43.537]  Let's watch.
[01:02:44.497 --> 01:02:46.079]  Welcome, Stephanie Grisham.
[01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:00.862]  I wasn't just a Trump supporter.
[01:03:00.882 --> 01:03:03.423]  I was a true believer.
[01:03:03.443 --> 01:03:05.824]  I was one of his closest advisors.
[01:03:07.124 --> 01:03:09.345]  The Trump family became my family.
[01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:14.567]  I spent Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's all at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:03:15.988 --> 01:03:17.668]  I saw him when the cameras were off.
[01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:22.310]  Behind closed doors, Trump mocks his supporters.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.611]  He calls them basement dwellers.
[01:03:26.388 --> 01:03:32.850]  On a hospital visit one time when people were dying in the ICU, he was mad that the cameras were not watching him.
[01:03:34.571 --> 01:03:39.693]  He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth.
[01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:44.755]  He used to tell me, it doesn't matter what you say, Stephanie.
[01:03:45.395 --> 01:03:47.316]  Say it enough and people will believe you.
[01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:49.876]  But it does matter.
[01:03:50.557 --> 01:03:51.517]  What you say matters.
[01:03:52.337 --> 01:03:53.718]  And what you don't say matters.
[01:03:55.259 --> 01:03:57.580]  On January 6th, I asked Melania if you could at least tweet the vote.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.101]  On January 6th, I asked Melania if you could at least tweet the vote.
[01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:00.761]  On January 6th, I asked Melania if you could at least tweet the vote.
[01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:05.884]  On January 6th, I asked Melania if you could at least tweet the vote.
[01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.220]  You're doing a great job.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.021]  I want you in here with me or you gotta get back to your family.
[01:04:26.722 --> 01:04:27.963]  You can stay with us or not.
[01:04:28.003 --> 01:04:28.423]  That's up to you.
[01:04:28.443 --> 01:04:29.364]  You've done a great job today.
[01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:32.206]  Party host in the War Room and more while Owen's out.
[01:04:33.167 --> 01:04:37.090]  But we've got Chase Geiser coming up here, too.
[01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:40.093]  That lady is the famous one that said Trump grabbed the wheel.
[01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:41.074]  Oh, is that her?
[01:04:41.494 --> 01:04:43.195]  Yeah, and a bunch of other crap.
[01:04:43.896 --> 01:04:45.377]  So this woman's been caught.
[01:04:45.397 --> 01:04:46.178]  She's a known liar.
[01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:47.799]  She's claiming all these things.
[01:04:47.819 --> 01:04:48.980]  She has contact with Trump.
[01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:51.022]  This is the deep state.
[01:04:51.062 --> 01:04:51.903]  This is what they do.
[01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:55.592]  And so they've turned a bunch of these people, or she may have been an operative from the beginning.
[01:04:55.612 --> 01:04:56.193]  She's a total fraud.
[01:04:56.213 --> 01:04:58.414]  There's a stampede of neocons and rhinos.
[01:04:58.854 --> 01:05:04.357]  The fact that the Republican Party hates Trump, the Republican Party establishment is all you need to know.
[01:05:04.757 --> 01:05:05.817]  Now, here's the news.
[01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.159]  Big Mike's coming up.
[01:05:09.219 --> 01:05:10.280]  Everything else, Obama.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.241]  We're going to get set up here in a break in a while.
[01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:18.664]  I'm going to come in here in about 45 minutes and co-host with you, or you can take a break, whatever you want.
[01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.708]  I have major RFK news.
[01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.556]  I have THE news exclusively.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:33.428]  Just got it 30 minutes ago from an impeccable source on whether or not he's about to drop out of the race and endorse Trump and everything else.
[01:05:34.048 --> 01:05:35.250]  So I have all the intel.
[01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.334]  I'm just collating it right now and I'm tempted to just break it live here in 45 minutes.
[01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:43.037]  Or I may just shoot something for X here in the next 30 minutes as well.
[01:05:43.057 --> 01:05:48.263]  But it'll be breaking regardless of the next hour right here on the live feed and at Real Alex Jones on X. Stay with us for that.
[01:05:48.283 --> 01:05:49.484]  And then we got all this other big news.
[01:05:50.464 --> 01:05:50.944]  All right, folks.
[01:05:50.964 --> 01:05:51.544]  You heard it there.
[01:05:51.704 --> 01:05:52.285]  Stay tuned.
[01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:54.786]  Alex Jones with breaking news in 45 minutes.
[01:05:54.906 --> 01:05:56.386]  I do plan on being here until at least 9.
[01:05:57.227 --> 01:05:59.447]  Of course, I host the morning show, so I gotta sleep.
[01:05:59.467 --> 01:06:07.170]  Yeah, and this is exclusive because we played the report earlier about, you know, some of the rumors going around, some of the statements made from RFK and from Trump.
[01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.551]  That's not what this is.
[01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:09.431]  This is something else.
[01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:10.031]  This is something new.
[01:06:10.071 --> 01:06:13.432]  This is a new development in that story.
[01:06:14.153 --> 01:06:14.673]  I don't even know it.
[01:06:14.913 --> 01:06:16.974]  I'm as excited as you are, folks, so stay tuned for that.
[01:06:17.836 --> 01:06:21.017]  Alex Jones will be breaking that down momentarily.
[01:06:21.697 --> 01:06:23.657]  We'll go back to this video, but Alex is exactly right.
[01:06:23.717 --> 01:06:24.657]  This is the deep state.
[01:06:26.538 --> 01:06:29.158]  This is the holdover operatives.
[01:06:30.878 --> 01:06:39.580]  And it's almost like her saying this stuff about her being so close to Trump and she was his advisor and she was, it's like, yeah, well, no wonder he couldn't get anything done.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.680]  He was surrounded by traitors.
[01:06:42.421 --> 01:06:44.401]  He was surrounded by turncoats.
[01:06:45.703 --> 01:06:46.203]  Scumbags.
[01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.584]  Even during Christmas he was surrounded by these people.
[01:06:49.344 --> 01:06:56.547]  She's saying this as if this gives her, you know, more authority when it comes to talking about Donald Trump.
[01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:57.307]  It does the opposite.
[01:06:57.327 --> 01:06:58.888]  Oh my God, look at Maxine Waters.
[01:06:59.775 --> 01:07:03.119]  Alright, so this is them putting her over the top.
[01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:07.505]  Have you ever seen a more deranged collection of ghouls?
[01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:08.586]  Look at this image.
[01:07:09.147 --> 01:07:09.767]  My god.
[01:07:09.868 --> 01:07:16.556]  Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, whatever that is on the right, and Gavin Newsom, American psycho presiding over it all.
[01:07:16.816 --> 01:07:17.217]  Let's listen.
[01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:25.250]  Our ability to live together and advance together and prosper together across every conceivable and imaginable difference.
[01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:32.651]  But the thing we pride ourselves most on is that we believe the future happens in California first.
[01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:34.272]  Somebody's listening to something on speakerphone.
[01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.793]  Oh my God, Maxine Waters, the fish monster.
[01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:44.834]  And Democrats, I've had the privilege for over 20 years to see that future in a waking shape.
[01:07:46.345 --> 01:07:51.169]  With a star in Alameda courtroom by the name of Kamala Harris.
[01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:54.751]  Is there a lowrider with its windows open playing music nearby?
[01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:55.652]  What is that?
[01:07:55.672 --> 01:08:02.477]  I saw that star fighting for criminal justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice.
[01:08:02.718 --> 01:08:13.126]  I saw that star get even brighter as Attorney General of California, as a United States Senator, and as Vice President of the United States of America.
[01:08:13.926 --> 01:08:19.489]  Kamala Harris has always done the right thing.
[01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:27.593]  A champion for voting rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, the rights for women and girls.
[01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:33.836]  So Democrats and independents, it's time for us to do the right thing.
[01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:40.219]  And that is to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America.
[01:08:41.236 --> 01:08:47.259]  Nope, the fish monster's flapping.
[01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:54.242]  Oh no, she's stroking out.
[01:08:55.702 --> 01:09:01.785]  What a deranged bunch of creeps.
[01:09:03.926 --> 01:09:08.768]  What a dysgenic bunch of psychopaths we have to deal with from California.
[01:09:11.909 --> 01:09:22.214]  Man... I'll tell you right now, Gavin Newsom... I'll tell you, what we just witnessed was a humiliation ritual for Gavin Newsom.
[01:09:23.215 --> 01:09:23.915]  I'll have you know.
[01:09:25.816 --> 01:09:30.098]  I was just reading this in the article that was talking about why he would be the one to put her over the top or whatever.
[01:09:30.798 --> 01:09:37.281]  They've known each other for three decades, Harris and Newsom, dating back to when they were up-and-coming San Francisco politicians.
[01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:39.802]  Their careers have been on roughly parallel tracks.
[01:09:40.162 --> 01:09:42.763]  Harris was elected San Francisco District Attorney in 2003.
[01:09:43.123 --> 01:09:47.265]  Newsom, who had been a San Francisco supervisor, was elected the city's mayor that same year.
[01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.886]  Harris was re-elected four years later, so was Newsom.
[01:09:50.826 --> 01:09:55.989]  She went on to run for Senate the same year that he ran for Governor of California.
[01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.491]  So they have been, they've been on parallel tracks.
[01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:01.533]  They very much started at the same place.
[01:10:03.874 --> 01:10:05.555]  Yeah, until Willie Brown got involved.
[01:10:08.878 --> 01:10:09.718]  Yeah, I'm not saying that.
[01:10:09.818 --> 01:10:15.902]  I'm not saying, the crew is telling me to say disgusting things about what Kamala Harris and Jimmy Brown got up to.
[01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:17.243]  Willie, Willie Brown.
[01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:19.901]  I'm not gonna say it.
[01:10:20.201 --> 01:10:21.782]  And God only knows what Newsom got up to.
[01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:24.743]  Even Kamala was bad.
[01:10:24.844 --> 01:10:32.227]  I mean... Look, this is the state where if you wanted to be in a Cheerios commercial, you had to... show you were willing.
[01:10:33.768 --> 01:10:38.630]  You don't become governor without... Well, we'll stop it.
[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:39.310]  We'll end it there.
[01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.030]  Okay?
[01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:45.573]  So, but just know, here's a dude who, yeah, he's governor of California, but, you know,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.801]  Kind of an abysmal record of failure.
[01:10:48.901 --> 01:10:52.682]  He's kind of had to survive several attacks against him.
[01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.063]  Is Kamala alive right now?
[01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:57.004]  Is she screeching about something?
[01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:09.469]  You're gonna have to watch this for four years, folks.
[01:11:10.418 --> 01:11:11.699]  Why are they holding freedom signs?
[01:11:11.759 --> 01:11:12.479]  My god.
[01:11:12.499 --> 01:11:16.021]  They cannot... They can't help themselves, honestly.
[01:11:27.688 --> 01:11:31.610]  I'm here for believing in what we can do together.
[01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.031]  We are so honored to be your nominees.
[01:11:35.511 --> 01:11:43.595]  This is a people-powered campaign and together we will chart a new way forward!
[01:11:43.615 --> 01:11:45.776]  Zero votes.
[01:11:46.516 --> 01:11:47.697]  Nobody voted for this woman.
[01:11:49.693 --> 01:11:50.554]  Oh my God, that voice.
[01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:51.535]  Folks, second gentleman.
[01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.640]  You're gonna have to listen to that voice for four years.
[01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:20.425]  Look, if that doesn't motivate you to be, as I speak, signing up to volunteer for Donald Trump's campaign, I don't know what will.
[01:12:21.726 --> 01:12:26.970]  Good lord, everything about them is so... just horrifying.
[01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.051]  It's all horrifying.
[01:12:30.093 --> 01:12:40.440]  They will... They will simultaneously... tell you that calling for liberty and freedom is a right-wing dog whistle that should be...
[01:12:41.522 --> 01:13:09.288]  Made illegal while waving a flag that says freedom Their entire agenda is Uniquely I mean like exclusively designed to destroy America and they're waving signs that say USA You would think they wouldn't be able to think you'd think there'd be some sort of cognitive dissidence that would manifest but now they just they trundle along and
[01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:11.316]  Is this lady speaking?
[01:13:11.337 --> 01:13:11.797]  Who is she?
[01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:15.899]  Oh, this is Ana Navarro!
[01:13:16.779 --> 01:13:17.239]  Oh, good.
[01:13:17.339 --> 01:13:21.341]  Another... I'm not gonna say that either.
[01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:22.462]  It looks like Elysium?
[01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.923]  I don't even know what Elysium is.
[01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:25.483]  Looks like America.
[01:13:25.503 --> 01:13:26.304]  Looks like America in 2024.
[01:13:26.344 --> 01:13:29.185]  The Hunger Games on the inside, the road on the outside.
[01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:41.065]  Oh my god, her fake Mexican accent.
[01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:41.865]  Oh my god.
[01:14:09.102 --> 01:14:10.023]  Let's be serious.
[01:14:11.123 --> 01:14:14.825]  They bring up Biden's dog on stage and he just starts killing people.
[01:14:14.845 --> 01:14:17.927]  You want to judge people on their dogs?
[01:14:18.868 --> 01:14:21.009]  Let's look at Major.
[01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:24.811]  It's like another Secret Service agent taken out of commission by Biden's dog.
[01:14:25.191 --> 01:14:31.735]  And let me tell you what communist dictators do and it's never just for one day.
[01:14:33.031 --> 01:14:37.234]  You are the enemy of the people.
[01:14:37.434 --> 01:14:38.435]  Who is she talking about?
[01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:38.795]  Hunter Biden?
[01:14:53.545 --> 01:14:55.567]  Trump's administration is communist.
[01:14:55.807 --> 01:14:56.468]  Okay.
[01:14:56.568 --> 01:14:57.068]  Keir Starmer.
[01:14:57.108 --> 01:14:57.388]  In the UK.
[01:14:57.448 --> 01:14:59.010]  I don't even understand you, lady.
[01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:21.997]  And I know one thing.
[01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.659]  It's not Kamala Harris.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.025]  That is not the America we love.
[01:15:28.205 --> 01:15:30.908]  It's not the land of freedom we treasure.
[01:15:31.408 --> 01:15:38.257]  Last night, we heard President Biden say that he loves his job, but he loves his country more.
[01:15:39.137 --> 01:15:43.119]  Every American needs to love our country more.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.842]  Every American has the duty to put our country first.
[01:15:48.442 --> 01:15:50.323]  Country first before party.
[01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:53.205]  Country first before political ambition.
[01:15:53.605 --> 01:15:55.566]  Country first before habit.
[01:15:56.106 --> 01:15:59.728]  And in this election, putting country first means one thing and one thing only.
[01:15:59.748 --> 01:16:00.949]  Voting for Kamala Harris.
[01:16:05.456 --> 01:16:08.618]  Like, I would have things to say about this, but it's literally meaningless.
[01:16:08.658 --> 01:16:10.759]  She might as well be, like, speaking Latin.
[01:16:10.839 --> 01:16:15.821]  Like, nothing she's saying has any remote connection to, like, what these people actually believe.
[01:16:15.982 --> 01:16:23.105]  It's very exhausting, having to hear these people claim to a... I mean, Kamala Harris is literally a communist.
[01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.607]  She just went on a big rant about Maduro and Castro.
[01:16:27.788 --> 01:16:31.390]  What about Kamala Harris's dad, who put price controls in Jamaica?
[01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:46.138]  How about Kamala Harris, who herself has adopted basically every communist slogan you can possibly imagine, and whose every policy so far has been an egregious tax on the middle class, directly out of the communist playbook?
[01:16:47.439 --> 01:16:50.341]  You want to talk about people arresting their political opponents?
[01:16:51.803 --> 01:16:53.864]  I mean, the obvious, the easy answer is just to point at
[01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:55.521]  You psychos.
[01:16:55.982 --> 01:17:05.168]  You despotic, tyrannical morons throwing grandmothers who wandered through the Capitol on January 6th in prison for 10 years on terrorism charges.
[01:17:05.328 --> 01:17:23.361]  That's the obvious answer, but another more, you know, contemporary example would be someone like the Prime Minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, who is systematically rounding up so many peaceful protesters for comments they made on Facebook that they're overcrowding prisons and his
[01:17:24.795 --> 01:17:37.041]  You know, answer is, response to that is to release thousands upon thousands of violent criminals, including an example of two people who butchered a kid, killed a kid with a machete, beheaded him.
[01:17:37.542 --> 01:17:39.362]  They're only going to be in prison for six months.
[01:17:39.402 --> 01:17:45.986]  They're being released to make room for a guy who, and this is a literal headline for today, yelled at a police dog.
[01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:46.946]  Oh my god.
[01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:51.529]  Chuck Schumer, about as good at dancing as he is at cooking hamburgers.
[01:17:51.549 --> 01:17:53.810]  Let's hear what this dumbass traitor has to say.
[01:17:56.184 --> 01:18:02.945]  Now just let me hear you if you're ready for President Kamala Harris!
[01:18:07.326 --> 01:18:16.608]  Friends, we're here to talk about one thing tomorrow, and building a better tomorrow for all Americans.
[01:18:17.448 --> 01:18:24.370]  This November, we can choose a brighter, a fairer, a freer future, or
[01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:31.101]  We can relive the dark night of Trump's American carnage.
[01:18:31.241 --> 01:18:31.802]  Oh, my God.
[01:18:31.922 --> 01:18:33.462]  Is this a program for children?
[01:18:33.602 --> 01:18:35.803]  Is this supposed to appeal to five-year-olds?
[01:18:35.983 --> 01:18:37.684]  Kamala Harris loves puppy.
[01:18:38.044 --> 01:18:39.165]  Trump is a bad guy.
[01:18:39.185 --> 01:18:40.805]  You don't want Voldemort in, do you?
[01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:45.107]  It's like, if this was an actual political event, I would be terrified for our country.
[01:18:45.227 --> 01:18:48.908]  It's very nice knowing this is all just play acting by morons for their moron audience.
[01:18:49.929 --> 01:18:52.370]  Under her and President Biden's leadership,
[01:18:53.446 --> 01:18:57.328]  100% of the jobs gained during their administration have gone to foreign-born.
[01:18:57.348 --> 01:18:57.328]  100%.
[01:18:58.269 --> 01:19:00.710]  And they just revised the job rate down by a million.
[01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.211]  Because all of their numbers are lies.
[01:19:23.775 --> 01:19:25.896]  Or like abortion and transing kids.
[01:19:27.437 --> 01:19:38.061]  Safe neighborhoods, safe schools, and building an opportunity economy that gives everyone a shot at the American dream.
[01:19:39.682 --> 01:19:45.984]  She will lead America forward into a brighter future, but she can't do it alone.
[01:19:46.784 --> 01:19:52.487]  She needs a Democratic majority in the Senate of the United States.
[01:19:57.341 --> 01:19:57.521]  , and
[01:20:13.224 --> 01:20:16.847]  Don't worry if everybody hates us and we're hugely unpopular.
[01:20:16.907 --> 01:20:18.308]  Votes don't matter anymore.
[01:20:18.388 --> 01:20:19.609]  I told them, you just wait.
[01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:20.509]  I'm gonna go kill myself.
[01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:20.950]  Stay tuned.
[01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:44.567]  To defend a woman's right to choose.
[01:20:46.088 --> 01:20:48.790]  To deliver for communities back home.
[01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:50.992]  Our senators are doing it.
[01:20:51.832 --> 01:20:56.255]  Like Jackie Rosen, delivering high-speed rail for Nevada.
[01:20:58.037 --> 01:21:02.080]  John Tester, bringing high-tech jobs to Montana.
[01:21:04.108 --> 01:21:11.433]  The Absolute Clown Show continues with Chuck Schumer just creeping everybody out.
[01:21:34.331 --> 01:21:44.001]  I was confused at his claim that a Democrat had brought high-speed rail to Nevada.
[01:21:44.021 --> 01:21:45.802]  I hadn't heard of that because it doesn't exist.
[01:21:45.843 --> 01:21:53.390]  So I guess this is sort of the same thing as everything else.
[01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:54.291]  It's imaginary.
[01:21:54.351 --> 01:21:55.192]  It's non-existent.
[01:21:55.612 --> 01:21:57.013]  It's a promise that will never be fulfilled.
[01:21:57.614 --> 01:21:57.994]  So there you go.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.161]  Rail spikes have been hammered.
[01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:03.603]  Bullet train being built from Sin City to the City of Angels.
[01:22:04.804 --> 01:22:07.346]  So I guess from LA to Las Vegas.
[01:22:08.447 --> 01:22:14.051]  Of course, California tried to build a high-speed rail, spent billions of dollars, and achieved nothing.
[01:22:14.711 --> 01:22:24.258]  Kind of like when Biden took billions upon billions of dollars to build high, like, fast-charging electric vehicle stations, and built, I think, two?
[01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:27.581]  I think two is how many he built for ten billion dollars.
[01:22:28.837 --> 01:22:32.898]  Yeah, so just, you know, more promises, never fulfill anything, but always have more promises.
[01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.499]  They always have more to offer.
[01:22:34.999 --> 01:22:42.381]  You never get what you pay for, but they always got another menu to, you know, let you know what else, what other illusions are available.
[01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:48.502]  What other ridiculous lies that they want to steal billions of your dollars for?
[01:22:49.043 --> 01:22:50.183]  Sorry, let's go back to the vampire.
[01:22:52.439 --> 01:22:56.582]  Abortion is their only, it's the only thing they have.
[01:22:56.662 --> 01:22:59.445]  Everything else is platitudes.
[01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:04.910]  Rigs the game, I mean what, this means nothing.
[01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:07.772]  Abortions are only platforms.
[01:23:08.272 --> 01:23:12.716]  Abortion is the only thing they can actually point to as a tangible promise of theirs.
[01:23:12.736 --> 01:23:13.797]  We will let you kill your children.
[01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:34.718]  As the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in American history, I want my grandkids and all grandkids to never, never face discrimination because of who they are.
[01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:41.042]  But Donald Trump, this is a guy who peddles anti-Semitic stereotypes.
[01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:45.866]  He even invited a white supremacist to Mar-a-Lago.
[01:23:47.748 --> 01:23:51.849]  And unfortunately, his prejudice goes in all directions.
[01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:58.331]  He fueled Islamophobia and issued a Muslim ban as president.
[01:24:01.032 --> 01:24:09.175]  Tonight, folks, I am wearing this blue square to stand up to anti-Semitism.
[01:24:09.755 --> 01:24:11.916]  To stand up to all hate.
[01:24:14.088 --> 01:24:14.548]  Most hate.
[01:24:14.628 --> 01:24:15.949]  Well, let's be fair, most hate.
[01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:21.311]  If we could split screen with the Palestinians burning the Israeli flag outside, that'd be nice.
[01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:22.951]  Alright folks, here's what we're going to do.
[01:24:22.971 --> 01:24:24.852]  We're going to take a break from...
[01:24:32.625 --> 01:24:34.525]  The Crypt Keeper's lies here for a moment.
[01:24:34.765 --> 01:24:39.166]  I'm going to throw to a quick report while we get set up with Alex Jones in studio.
[01:24:39.546 --> 01:24:46.388]  He is going to be filming live a report with this breaking exclusive news you're not going to hear anywhere else has to do with RFK Jr.
[01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:49.589]  and his plans for the future of his presidential campaign.

[01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:08.335]  Alex Jones in studio.
[01:25:08.595 --> 01:25:10.416]  Huge, breaking, exclusive news.
[01:25:10.876 --> 01:25:12.597]  ReRFK Jr.
[01:25:13.158 --> 01:25:14.178]  coming up momentarily.
[01:25:14.438 --> 01:25:16.039]  And then more DNC coverage on the other side.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:17.260]  Stay tuned.
[01:25:17.932 --> 01:25:25.374]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:25:25.815 --> 01:25:33.457]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:35.818]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:41.463]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:25:42.004 --> 01:25:47.369]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:25:47.449 --> 01:25:50.793]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:53.816]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:25:53.856 --> 01:25:56.419]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:25:58.809 --> 01:26:00.830]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:04.792]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:26:04.852 --> 01:26:12.737]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:15.150]  The U.S.
[01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:18.791]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:26:19.152 --> 01:26:26.774]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:29.475]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:26:29.495 --> 01:26:32.736]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:26:32.876 --> 01:26:38.218]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:26:38.238 --> 01:26:40.459]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:26:44.326 --> 01:26:48.710]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:27:27.694 --> 01:27:29.076]  It's Tuesday, August 20th, 2024.
[01:27:29.216 --> 01:27:31.739]  8.30pm Central.
[01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:32.861]  Live coverage of the DNC.
[01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:37.907]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:27:38.107 --> 01:27:39.068]  InfoWars.
[01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:42.212]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:28:01.872 --> 01:28:08.094]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday, August 20th, 2024 transmission.
[01:28:09.395 --> 01:28:15.057]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're giving you live coverage right through until 11.30 tonight.
[01:28:15.117 --> 01:28:20.839]  Send for a lot of guests like they did last night with Joe Biden and his shower partner, his daughter and Hunter and all the rest of them.
[01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:29.822]  So I'm going to be here with Chase Geiser and the great Harrison Smith covering all of this as Big Mike and Obama and others speak.
[01:28:32.867 --> 01:28:41.889]  I've got major breaking exclusive news right now in the middle of the DNC on this Tuesday, August 20th, 2024 broadcast.
[01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:51.611]  It's been a huge viral story since midday when the vice president pick by RFK Jr.
[01:28:51.631 --> 01:28:59.973]  Nicole Sheehan did a podcast this morning and said they were strongly considering
[01:29:02.185 --> 01:29:12.212]  Joining the Trump campaign so that the globalists, so that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do not get in there.
[01:29:16.455 --> 01:29:27.423]  I shot a report about it a few hours ago and then I started reaching out to some of my contacts and I was able to confirm about an hour ago
[01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:30.270]  That RFK Jr.
[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:38.132]  is going to be endorsing President Trump this Friday in Los Angeles.
[01:29:39.193 --> 01:29:44.094]  And I was given other details, but I'm not going to give those out about how they're going to do it at this point.
[01:29:44.174 --> 01:29:48.315]  This is from inside the RFK Jr.
[01:29:48.515 --> 01:29:51.635]  campaign from a very, very trusted source.
[01:29:53.716 --> 01:29:53.816]  And
[01:29:55.990 --> 01:30:15.856]  It turns out that when I started reaching out to people, they reached out to some of their contacts, and then I was called back from someone inside of their operation, who'd already seen the ex-post we did about two hours ago at Real Alex Jones, where I surmised the fact that RFK Jr.
[01:30:15.896 --> 01:30:23.639]  saw his father murdered when he was the Attorney General, saw his uncle, the President, murdered, and that he saw them attempt to kill Trump
[01:30:25.399 --> 01:30:31.541]  And that he knows that the same Secret Service that's been trying to get him killed has not given him any Secret Service protection.
[01:30:32.481 --> 01:30:35.942]  And that I believe that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[01:30:35.982 --> 01:30:51.847]  I also had sources very close to his campaign, high up, that had told me that he had been gunning for the head of the EPA, or the head of the NIH, or even the Attorney General slot that his father, Robert F. Kennedy Sr., had.
[01:30:53.595 --> 01:30:58.758]  And again, I've talked to several sources, but that definitely has resonated with folks.
[01:31:00.199 --> 01:31:08.923]  So, I can again announce to you here, and then I'll talk about some of the issues involved and why this is so important and so big, that RFK Jr.
[01:31:09.083 --> 01:31:18.889]  is set Friday to announce in Los Angeles that he is dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing Donald John Trump
[01:31:20.202 --> 01:31:25.926]  The 45th and really the 46th, but they stole it, and soon to be the 47th President of the United States.
[01:31:25.966 --> 01:31:27.147]  Now, RFK Jr.
[01:31:27.948 --> 01:31:37.255]  has also really been upset by being taken off the ballot of his home state for most of his life, New York City.
[01:31:38.015 --> 01:31:42.739]  And the fact that the corporate media and the Democrats didn't just refuse him Secret Service protection,
[01:31:43.713 --> 01:31:53.061]  But that they also, again, did things like pull him off the ballot when he was legally and lawfully on it, saying he didn't even live in the state, even though he's domiciled there.
[01:31:53.582 --> 01:31:57.505]  So, the Democrats arrogantly, totally screwed him and screwed all of his supporters.
[01:31:58.266 --> 01:32:03.190]  Depending on the poll, he has 6 to 10 to 12 points of people that are saying they're going to vote.
[01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:06.053]  He's not like the Libertarian Party or some little party.
[01:32:06.513 --> 01:32:08.114]  He has real support.
[01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:35.224]  So you add Trump being 20 points ahead in national polls, real polls, 10-15 points ahead in battleground states, despite all the spin polls that are trying to gaslight people, adding even 5-6 points on on the low end, 10-12 points on the high end, absolutely is the ultimate game changer and it's so important and it's such amazingly positive and exciting news for the world.
[01:32:36.645 --> 01:32:36.785]  Now,
[01:32:38.823 --> 01:32:44.588]  Trump was interviewed just a few hours ago and asked about this and asked, does he like RFK Jr.?
[01:32:44.668 --> 01:32:48.311]  And would he consider him in a cabinet position or a major position?
[01:32:48.371 --> 01:32:52.394]  He said, absolutely, that he would.
[01:32:52.414 --> 01:32:56.757]  And of course, Trump keeps his cards very, very close to the vest.
[01:32:57.298 --> 01:32:58.098]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:01.986]  And that video is also posted on my ex account.
[01:33:02.307 --> 01:33:10.155]  We're doing this live right now on air, but I'm going to take this in a few minutes, add the Trump clip onto the end, as well, so you can see that for yourself.
[01:33:10.215 --> 01:33:11.396]  Now, RFK Jr.
[01:33:11.556 --> 01:33:22.248]  may decide, for whatever reason, because I put this out, probably not, or maybe Logistics, they may change it to Thursday, they may change it to Saturday, it may be next Monday, but they have decided
[01:33:23.587 --> 01:33:35.136]  On Friday, and the people are there, and the people are being assembled, and the presentation is being prepared, the event is being prepared for him to make this announcement.
[01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:41.942]  And then a full-throated endorsement of President Trump, and the peril this nation is in.
[01:33:41.962 --> 01:33:44.144]  I think it would make a great Attorney General.
[01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:46.832]  I think that's really the smartest move.
[01:33:47.293 --> 01:33:52.160]  It would also be great assassination insurance for Trump because the globalists really hate RFK Jr.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:52.580]  as well.
[01:33:53.442 --> 01:33:56.746]  I think Tulsi Gabbard's and this is being discussed and looks like it'll happen.
[01:33:58.046 --> 01:34:01.249]  We'll also have a major position in the Trump administration.
[01:34:01.889 --> 01:34:05.532]  Look for that to be announced, I would imagine, in the next two weeks.
[01:34:05.612 --> 01:34:08.374]  So these are real classical liberals.
[01:34:08.414 --> 01:34:11.317]  These are what the old Democrats were before they became pure evil.
[01:34:12.177 --> 01:34:15.700]  And they have really woken up to the spiritual battle we're in.
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:18.042]  And this is extremely exciting, so thank God.
[01:34:18.843 --> 01:34:19.923]  And this is just great news.
[01:34:19.983 --> 01:34:21.565]  But bottom line, RFK Jr.
[01:34:21.685 --> 01:34:22.525]  is endorsing Trump.
[01:34:23.246 --> 01:34:24.647]  This is an exclusive here.
[01:34:25.428 --> 01:34:33.494]  And it's people like Stephen Colbert attacking him and laughing and celebrating and saying how great it is that, you know, he's a bad person, and thank God he's been taken off the ballot.
[01:34:33.854 --> 01:34:35.955]  It's the leering and the arrogance of these people.
[01:34:35.995 --> 01:34:52.908]  Now, depending on the expert in the actuaries, and we've interviewed Professor Epstein and so many others that are top experts, there's between 6 to 12 points, just like with RFK Jr., it's a similar number, that dead people voting and people out of district voting in that database that Zuckerberg created,
[01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:55.452]  We're good to go.
[01:34:55.992 --> 01:34:56.372]  We're good to go.
[01:35:20.962 --> 01:35:23.203]  They've been caught so much at that, that's being watched.
[01:35:23.563 --> 01:35:24.844]  So they're going to try to steal it.
[01:35:24.904 --> 01:35:27.785]  But if Trump's already ahead, and then RFK Jr.
[01:35:27.825 --> 01:35:33.527]  goes on the campaign trail with him and campaigns separately, this is a big game changer.
[01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.508]  So thank God, thank your lucky stars.
[01:35:35.888 --> 01:35:40.470]  This is a real ray of sunshine in this incredibly dangerous time with the left trying to start World War III.
[01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:50.778]  The New York Times is now reporting that Biden put all the nuclear forces on alert and ordered them to be ready to nuke China, Russia, and North Korea in March and going forward.
[01:35:50.818 --> 01:35:52.339]  That could be their October surprise.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.464]  These people are crazed clown show demonic maniacs and we need
[01:35:59.414 --> 01:36:00.394]  Donald Trump.
[01:36:00.575 --> 01:36:02.555]  We need RFK Jr.
[01:36:02.616 --> 01:36:09.919]  We need all these great people that Trump is surrounding him with, and to unify America.
[01:36:09.959 --> 01:36:19.123]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong, and it's about saving our republic, and stopping World War III, and securing our border, and stopping the inflation, and stopping the fentanyl, and all the rest of it.
[01:36:19.163 --> 01:36:22.285]  So, here is the exclusive, breaking
[01:36:23.427 --> 01:36:26.410]  And again, it's my job as a newsman to bring you this information.
[01:36:27.151 --> 01:36:38.821]  And also, when this gets tens of millions of views, people can, you know, also get the other backstory and the data that's going to be very, very important to have massive focus on what's coming Friday at the big announcement that RFK Jr.
[01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:39.842]  is set to make.
[01:36:39.902 --> 01:36:44.226]  So that's why I decided to go ahead and break this information here tonight.
[01:36:44.907 --> 01:36:51.353]  So here is this special report now being posted on X. Be sure to share it everywhere and please follow me right here at Real Alex Jones.
[01:36:51.413 --> 01:37:09.368]  If you're watching tonight or Wednesday night or Thursday night, we've got live coverage at Real Alex Jones and on radio stations across the country and at InfoWars.com forward slash show and band up video where you can get our live analysis and reporting on the Democrat national catastrophe taking place in Chicago, Illinois.
[01:37:09.748 --> 01:37:11.870]  We're going to go to break and we'll be right back with more live coverage.
[01:37:22.822 --> 01:37:25.844]  I would love everybody who's Republican to get down.
[01:37:25.964 --> 01:37:26.445]  What'd they say?
[01:37:26.465 --> 01:37:27.906]  Oh, we hate America?
[01:37:27.946 --> 01:37:28.386]  No, we don't.
[01:37:28.426 --> 01:37:29.047]  We hate you!
[01:37:29.647 --> 01:37:30.588]  We love America!
[01:37:30.628 --> 01:37:31.288]  We hate you!
[01:37:31.348 --> 01:37:32.869]  It's not good to hate anyone.
[01:37:33.090 --> 01:37:33.970]  I don't hate anyone.
[01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:37.433]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[01:37:38.333 --> 01:37:44.418]  If you were an elected official, do you think it might be a good idea to, like, put these Republican Trump-supporting QAnon voters in, like, re-education facilities and stuff?
[01:37:44.438 --> 01:37:44.698]  Yes!
[01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:45.078]  Yes!
[01:37:45.158 --> 01:37:46.199]  Yeah, re-educate them?
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:47.280]  Yes!
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.043]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:37:53.329 --> 01:37:56.972]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[01:37:57.673 --> 01:38:08.002]  But I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24-7 on the internet, by their constituents, and they bought into this big lie.
[01:38:08.383 --> 01:38:15.650]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:24.183]  And the bottom line is all of America needs programming because we've all been negatively influenced by Donald Trump.
[01:38:24.643 --> 01:38:26.226]  There are millions of Americans.
[01:38:28.084 --> 01:38:35.428]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[01:38:35.869 --> 01:38:38.930]  It's as if they are members of a cult.
[01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:50.998]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized people, and President Trump pulled the plug.
[01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:56.201]  One thing that we know is that we have to get that funding right back up, and we probably need to
[01:38:56.961 --> 01:39:02.803]  Double, triple, quadruple, or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs.
[01:39:03.243 --> 01:39:15.647]  And sadly, so many of those extremists, those mega extremists, take their marching orders from Donald Trump, who has no credibility left by any measure.
[01:39:16.187 --> 01:39:17.748]  He's only in it for himself.
[01:39:17.828 --> 01:39:21.069]  He's now defending himself in civil actions and criminal actions.
[01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:22.929]  And when do they break with him?
[01:39:22.949 --> 01:39:30.232]  You know, because at some point, you know, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of the cult members.
[01:39:30.573 --> 01:39:36.115]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[01:39:37.655 --> 01:39:47.559]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[01:39:50.049 --> 01:39:59.193]  Well, we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[01:40:00.093 --> 01:40:06.435]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate, that are die-hard capitalists?
[01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:10.137]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:40:11.577 --> 01:40:19.360]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:40:20.021 --> 01:40:21.761]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:24.182]  So I have the solution.
[01:40:25.163 --> 01:40:36.688]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not talking about, well, hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[01:40:38.151 --> 01:40:41.353]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[01:40:42.074 --> 01:40:44.636]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[01:40:46.377 --> 01:40:46.997]  Immigrants.
[01:40:47.358 --> 01:40:51.260]  Quite honestly, you know, the health sector doesn't know what to do.
[01:40:51.881 --> 01:40:54.903]  Because this is now, first and foremost, a political problem.
[01:40:56.024 --> 01:41:04.010]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:05.391]  We're going to have to bring in
[01:41:06.772 --> 01:41:12.334]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[01:41:12.474 --> 01:41:24.939]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[01:41:24.999 --> 01:41:27.520]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:37.543]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[01:41:38.003 --> 01:41:43.205]  200,000 Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[01:41:43.725 --> 01:41:57.170]  And so this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives,
[01:41:57.870 --> 01:42:02.175]  The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[01:42:02.635 --> 01:42:10.924]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[01:42:10.944 --> 01:42:15.068]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions.
[01:42:21.607 --> 01:42:22.748]  Please pray for him, 4 Wars.
[01:42:23.009 --> 01:42:24.791]  Please pray for the crew, and I'm so thankful to the crew.
[01:42:24.811 --> 01:42:25.892]  They're doing such a great job.
[01:42:25.912 --> 01:42:31.619]  I'm so thankful to Owen, and to Chase, and to all the rest of the crew, and to Rob Dooher here with me right now.

[01:43:30.574 --> 01:43:31.234]  We'll be back.
[01:43:32.685 --> 01:43:40.951]  Alright folks, this evening we are watching the second installment of the DNCCP and I believe it is as boring as yesterday.
[01:43:40.971 --> 01:43:53.159]  Right now we're watching a bunch of delegates scream their support for Kamala Harris in a ceremonial meaningless ritual similar to the acolyte season that was canceled from Disney Plus for Star Wars because it's garbage.
[01:43:53.179 --> 01:43:56.441]  Harrison, you were killing it, man, with the first hour of coverage.
[01:43:56.461 --> 01:43:57.261]  I really appreciate it.
[01:43:57.281 --> 01:43:58.242]  I actually learned a few things.
[01:43:58.522 --> 01:44:03.585]  Well, it's all ridiculous nonsense, so I'm just happy to be here.
[01:44:04.146 --> 01:44:11.971]  No, yeah, it's been fairly boring, but I am enjoying the contrast, and I don't know, guys, we can get that picture-in-picture setup again.
[01:44:12.031 --> 01:44:20.056]  I really like the duality of the inside being a big gay dance party and the outside being a... A big gay riot.
[01:44:20.156 --> 01:44:21.237]  A big gay riot, exactly.
[01:44:22.137 --> 01:44:22.997]  Exactly.
[01:44:23.217 --> 01:44:29.380]  You've got the police state being taken out by the highly funded foreign agitators on the outside.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.901]  On the inside, you have everybody pretending to participate in the democratic process.
[01:44:33.021 --> 01:44:34.422]  It's appropriate.
[01:44:34.442 --> 01:44:38.063]  I think it's very appropriate for what we expect from these people.
[01:44:38.523 --> 01:44:40.724]  So, I want to talk about the elephant in the room.
[01:44:41.224 --> 01:44:42.065]  Love Roger Stone.
[01:44:42.185 --> 01:44:42.865]  Brilliant guy.
[01:44:43.066 --> 01:44:45.948]  One of the most brilliant political minds in the history of political minds, in my opinion.
[01:44:46.288 --> 01:44:46.969]  Love everything about him.
[01:44:46.989 --> 01:44:49.571]  Read his books, watched documentaries about him, interviewed him, talked to him.
[01:44:50.011 --> 01:44:51.072]  I think he's just all around awesome.
[01:44:51.512 --> 01:44:53.634]  Seems like he was wrong about the Michelle Obama prediction.
[01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:57.377]  Well, you know, things change.
[01:44:57.957 --> 01:44:58.177]  Yeah.
[01:44:58.497 --> 01:45:01.660]  You know, it could have been a position potentially.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.541]  Things could still change now.
[01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:04.222]  I mean, who knows?
[01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:07.544]  I mean, technically Joe Biden had enough delegates to be the candidate and then he wasn't.
[01:45:07.624 --> 01:45:10.687]  So just because Kamala does doesn't mean something couldn't happen unforeseen.
[01:45:11.255 --> 01:45:14.838]  Yeah, and again, you know, they change plans sometimes.
[01:45:14.918 --> 01:45:21.642]  Maybe it was intention at first to bring in Michelle, and they decided that Kamala would be better.
[01:45:22.002 --> 01:45:22.403]  Who knows?
[01:45:22.723 --> 01:45:24.464]  It doesn't really matter at the end of the day, right?
[01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:29.568]  I mean, at the end of the day, their calculus is who can we present to the American people as a feasible
[01:45:30.495 --> 01:45:32.776]  You know, person to pretend has a lot of support.
[01:45:32.836 --> 01:45:34.197]  It doesn't matter who they are.
[01:45:34.237 --> 01:45:46.264]  Well, I think his plan definitely would have come to fruition, or his prediction, rather, would have definitely come to fruition had the polls not been so consistently rigged in favor of Kamala the last several weeks.
[01:45:46.304 --> 01:45:51.848]  I mean, he was saying before August 1st that if the polls show that she's significantly lagging behind by August 1st,
[01:45:52.888 --> 01:45:55.209]  Then that is when Michelle will swoop in, but that didn't happen.
[01:45:55.249 --> 01:46:00.131]  I mean, they managed the narrative in terms of the numbers that were publicly released regardless of their veracity.
[01:46:00.611 --> 01:46:08.094]  The numbers that were publicly released showed enough support that wouldn't justify from a PR standpoint subverting her in the same way that they were able to subvert Joe.
[01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:16.298]  Yeah, I just, you know, to be honest with you, I never thought the Michelle possibility was all that great just because
[01:46:18.058 --> 01:46:19.378]  So much stuff in her background.
[01:46:19.398 --> 01:46:22.059]  She, there were... She has a giant cock.
[01:46:22.239 --> 01:46:26.901]  She also is a man and, you know, nobody likes dishonest people.
[01:46:28.301 --> 01:46:37.685]  Yeah, I just, you know, it always seemed a little bit far-fetched to me, although it is a very convenient way to sort of circumvent the whole, you can't serve as president three times just to have your wife run.
[01:46:37.705 --> 01:46:38.565]  Yeah.
[01:46:38.685 --> 01:46:39.485]  That would have been convenient.
[01:46:39.965 --> 01:46:43.206]  Yeah, well, that's certainly what the Clintons were going for with Hillary.
[01:46:43.427 --> 01:46:47.488]  Yeah, well, and, you know, both Big Mike and Obama are
[01:46:50.147 --> 01:47:02.513]  I thought it was interesting that they had Hillary Clinton speak on the first night, so it's the least consequential night of the convention.
[01:47:02.553 --> 01:47:09.675]  I guess it's important because it's the first impression, but they had her speak on the first night and they didn't really have her speak that close to the president.
[01:47:09.896 --> 01:47:13.817]  She wasn't like, you know, the runner-up or the opening act.
[01:47:14.157 --> 01:47:16.998]  Like, I would have thought they would have given her a little bit more of a bone than they did last night.
[01:47:17.018 --> 01:47:18.199]  I thought it was almost disrespectful.
[01:47:18.399 --> 01:47:20.180]  No, it was the loser night.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.401]  The first night's always loser night.
[01:47:21.441 --> 01:47:22.502]  It was the same with the RNC.
[01:47:22.522 --> 01:47:28.547]  I remember the first day of the RNC was like all the people that had run against Trump in the primary gave speeches endorsing him.
[01:47:28.567 --> 01:47:31.048]  So it was sort of the same thing with the first night of the DNC.
[01:47:31.128 --> 01:47:32.489]  Oh yeah, they brought out Nikki Haley.
[01:47:32.509 --> 01:47:33.390]  You had all the losers.
[01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:35.071]  Yeah, you had all the losers come out to
[01:47:36.132 --> 01:47:44.736]  Just get him out of the way, have him endorse Kamala, pretend like there's some sort of unity and pretend like this is some sort of political activity rather than just a big show for everyone.
[01:47:45.116 --> 01:47:49.478]  So, Jones was talking a lot last night about how a lot of people in the audience here at the DNC are paid to be there.
[01:47:50.472 --> 01:47:51.532]  Can you tell me a little bit about that?
[01:47:51.552 --> 01:47:52.293]  Have you looked into that?
[01:47:52.313 --> 01:47:57.635]  I mean, obviously what Jones says is correct 99% of the time, but what are the details of that?
[01:47:57.695 --> 01:48:00.836]  How many, do you know off the top of your head, how many people there were actually paid?
[01:48:00.856 --> 01:48:06.038]  I know that they were offering to several podcast influencers, especially in the minority community space.
[01:48:06.698 --> 01:48:11.403]  Upwards of $10,000 to interview Kamala Harris and they were declining.
[01:48:11.443 --> 01:48:20.173]  We had clips this week that we showed on some of the shows of podcasters coming out and sharing the screenshots of their DM exchanges with the Kamala Harris campaign where they were offering $10,000
[01:48:22.515 --> 01:48:23.056]  We're good to go.
[01:48:44.073 --> 01:48:44.373]  We're good.
[01:49:02.243 --> 01:49:03.004]  Oh yeah, Malik.
[01:49:19.093 --> 01:49:25.778]  The fact that they're having to pay people to interview who's, you know, got a great chance at being the next president of the United States.
[01:49:25.818 --> 01:49:27.099]  You know, I think she's losing.
[01:49:27.139 --> 01:49:27.880]  I think she's going to lose.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:28.820]  I pray and hope that she is.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:34.445]  I'm not trying to speak it into reality, but she has got close to a 50% chance.
[01:49:34.525 --> 01:49:37.087]  Maybe she should be a desirable interview subject.
[01:49:37.427 --> 01:49:37.687]  Yes.
[01:49:37.747 --> 01:49:40.949]  Like I would, I would think that people would be paying her or her campaign.
[01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:42.971]  Like I'll donate this to your campaign if you come on my show.
[01:49:43.211 --> 01:49:46.854]  Like I think, but now they're actually having to pay people to even want to talk to her.
[01:49:47.074 --> 01:49:49.035]  Yeah, well, and they're paying people to endorse her.
[01:49:49.595 --> 01:49:53.877]  This is them trying to deal with the modern media landscape.
[01:49:53.897 --> 01:50:01.041]  See, they're used to a media landscape that's dominated by Hollywood and by television news, where everybody there is in their pocket.
[01:50:01.081 --> 01:50:06.384]  The celebrities endorse them, the, you know, CNN, MSNBC, they have all of them in their pocket.
[01:50:06.464 --> 01:50:12.026]  Now, with this new landscape where you've got all these influencers that are independent, they're trying out a new thing.
[01:50:12.046 --> 01:50:12.967]  They're trying to co-opt them.
[01:50:13.627 --> 01:50:14.348]  We're good to go.
[01:50:39.878 --> 01:50:50.587]  Apparently, the CEO or somebody of Rumble, Chris Pavlosky, said that Rumble reached out multiple times to the DNC to have a presence at the Chicago convention, just like they did at the RNC.
[01:50:51.127 --> 01:50:53.129]  They said, quote, we finally received a response.
[01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:58.053]  The DNC wouldn't let us stream, but instead offered to sell us two convention tickets for $200,000.
[01:50:58.153 --> 01:50:58.473]  We declined.
[01:51:01.696 --> 01:51:08.239]  So, they offered Rumble, as a corporation, two tickets for $200,000.
[01:51:08.519 --> 01:51:15.123]  But you can watch it for free on Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:51:15.143 --> 01:51:18.304]  Yeah folks, we're saving you $200,000 getting to watch this complete nonsense.
[01:51:18.344 --> 01:51:20.145]  And hey, you get to see the violence outside too.
[01:51:20.185 --> 01:51:21.326]  And the best way to give back.
[01:51:22.006 --> 01:51:23.867]  Is to go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:23.927 --> 01:51:24.647]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:24.668 --> 01:51:31.931]  So, you know, and I think it's interesting you mentioned that they're trying to, that the Kamala Harris campaign is trying to break into this new landscape of podcasters and influencers and independent media.
[01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:33.092]  I think you're absolutely right.
[01:51:33.512 --> 01:51:39.496]  But one thing I really noticed that was a subtle thing, when Donald Trump a couple of weeks ago did the Aiden Ross interview.
[01:51:40.056 --> 01:51:40.896]  First of all, I love Aiden Ross.
[01:51:40.916 --> 01:51:41.617]  Hilarious kid.
[01:51:42.297 --> 01:51:43.718]  Whatever you say about him, I mean, it's awesome.
[01:51:43.738 --> 01:51:45.599]  He gave a Cybertruck to Trump, gave him a Rolex.
[01:51:46.239 --> 01:51:46.840]  That was great.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.921]  It was just awesome.
[01:51:48.141 --> 01:51:52.785]  And apparently the reason Trump agreed to do that interview is because Barron is a huge fan of Aiden Ross.
[01:51:53.145 --> 01:52:01.072]  So you have Trump intentionally and actively listening to Barron in order to tap into a generation that he would otherwise be detached from.
[01:52:01.092 --> 01:52:11.742]  And while the left in the Kamala Harris campaign try consistently, incessantly to brand Trump now as the old candidate, despite the fact that they were totally cool with Joe Biden being ancient.
[01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:14.715]  He seems to actually be the one more in touch.
[01:52:14.735 --> 01:52:19.659]  I mean today, he did an interview with Theo Vaughn, which I cannot wait to listen to.
[01:52:19.819 --> 01:52:21.740]  The clips I've heard are outrageous.
[01:52:22.461 --> 01:52:23.281]  They're insane.
[01:52:23.442 --> 01:52:24.322]  Have you seen any of them?
[01:52:24.542 --> 01:52:26.644]  No, I haven't seen any of it at all.
[01:52:26.764 --> 01:52:29.146]  All the clips I've seen is Theo Vaughn talking about cocaine.
[01:52:30.888 --> 01:52:31.969]  Well, Trump hates drugs.
[01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:35.612]  Yeah, yeah, and he's telling, Trump's going, oh, and you like that?
[01:52:35.672 --> 01:52:37.754]  Oh, and that's good for you when you feel that way?
[01:52:37.794 --> 01:52:42.118]  It's, it looked like a crazy, but yeah, Theo Vaughn, massively popular.
[01:52:42.218 --> 01:52:42.979]  And hysterical.
[01:52:43.159 --> 01:52:43.639]  And very funny.
[01:52:43.659 --> 01:52:44.360]  And very earnest.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:44.760]  Very mainstream.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:47.243]  Whatever you think about him, I mean, this is like, you can tell he's just a good guy.
[01:52:47.863 --> 01:52:55.872]  Yeah, it's like in that whole scene there's constantly like backbiting and betrayals and I mean the whole like comedy scene that Theovon's from is like very... It's vicious.
[01:52:56.152 --> 01:52:56.873]  It's very vicious.
[01:52:57.053 --> 01:52:58.755]  Nobody has a bad word to say about Theovon.
[01:52:59.016 --> 01:53:03.000]  He's probably one of, if not the most popular stand-up comic working right now.
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.982]  He just walks in with a mullet and a smirk.
[01:53:05.102 --> 01:53:05.703]  Oh my god, he's so funny.
[01:53:05.723 --> 01:53:07.485]  Claims that when he was a kid he beat down syndrome.
[01:53:07.725 --> 01:53:08.765]  Yeah.
[01:53:08.826 --> 01:53:13.668]  He's like, there was a rumor going around my town when I was growing up that I had downs and I beat it.
[01:53:15.568 --> 01:53:17.009]  I just got better.
[01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:19.510]  But you're right.
[01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:24.992]  It shatters the perspective, the illusion that the Democrats want to portray of Trump's.
[01:53:25.332 --> 01:53:25.913]  Trump's old.
[01:53:25.953 --> 01:53:26.613]  He's out of touch.
[01:53:26.653 --> 01:53:27.893]  It's like, but he's doing Aiden Ross.
[01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:32.956]  He's doing Theo Vaughn and Kamala Harris can't do Jack squat other than go up on a stage where everybody's paid to celebrate her.
[01:53:33.016 --> 01:53:33.876]  I mean, this is bizarro.
[01:53:33.936 --> 01:53:34.456]  Yeah.
[01:53:34.516 --> 01:53:35.657]  Or doing, you know.
[01:53:36.298 --> 01:53:37.899]  What was that famous Roman emperor?
[01:53:37.919 --> 01:53:39.840]  I wish Jeremy Ryan Slate was with us.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.041]  He was one of the great guests that we had.
[01:53:41.081 --> 01:53:42.842]  He's an expert in ancient Rome.
[01:53:43.222 --> 01:53:47.425]  Who was that famous Roman emperor that would play the lyre and he was terrible at it?
[01:53:47.505 --> 01:53:47.905]  Nero?
[01:53:48.286 --> 01:53:48.846]  Yeah, it was Nero.
[01:53:49.126 --> 01:53:52.008]  And he'd force people to attend and it was just supposedly awful.
[01:53:52.048 --> 01:53:54.029]  I mean, that's like what we're seeing at the DNC right now, right?
[01:53:54.430 --> 01:53:56.211]  Except they're all super into it.
[01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:57.352]  That's the creepy part.
[01:53:57.412 --> 01:53:57.772]  You think so?
[01:53:57.812 --> 01:53:58.813]  They're all very into it.
[01:53:58.853 --> 01:54:00.013]  Well, I mean, this is the thing.
[01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.054]  It is a charade.
[01:54:01.314 --> 01:54:03.296]  And I really, I think I've seen some people
[01:54:04.196 --> 01:54:09.160]  You know, sort of suggesting, calling this a coronation rather than a convention, because that's exactly what it is.
[01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:10.001]  Yeah.
[01:54:10.061 --> 01:54:10.301]  No vote.
[01:54:10.321 --> 01:54:15.385]  I don't know if you were watching earlier, I was saying it's like a, and the crew came, you know, gave me the word for it, vestigial.
[01:54:15.425 --> 01:54:16.686]  It's a vestigial practice.
[01:54:17.107 --> 01:54:17.907]  It once had meaning.
[01:54:17.947 --> 01:54:18.768]  It once had purpose.
[01:54:18.828 --> 01:54:21.130]  It once was how the sausage got made.
[01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:22.952]  It was how deals got struck.
[01:54:23.372 --> 01:54:24.673]  Now it's just play acting.
[01:54:24.713 --> 01:54:25.414]  It's just pretend.
[01:54:25.434 --> 01:54:27.035]  They're just, it was decided months ago.
[01:54:27.075 --> 01:54:30.218]  I mean, they had a virtual conviction where they already nominated.
[01:54:30.238 --> 01:54:30.758]  When was it?
[01:54:31.298 --> 01:54:31.819]  This was months ago.
[01:54:32.594 --> 01:54:35.255]  So even before the June 26th, was it before the debate?
[01:54:36.055 --> 01:54:36.335]  No, no, no.
[01:54:36.375 --> 01:54:40.696]  It would be after the debate when, I mean, when they first, like, announced Kamala Harris was going to replace Joe Biden.
[01:54:40.877 --> 01:54:44.698]  Oh, then they immediately held a virtual convention that was the legal one, and this is all just bull.
[01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:46.258]  It's literally play acting.
[01:54:46.478 --> 01:54:46.578]  Oh.
[01:54:46.778 --> 01:54:48.079]  Well, at least it's really entertaining.
[01:54:48.299 --> 01:54:48.519]  Is it?
[01:54:48.939 --> 01:54:50.679]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:54:50.739 --> 01:54:55.101]  I said on your show this morning that it was like watching Schindler's List with Japanese dubs and no subtitles.
[01:54:55.681 --> 01:54:56.681]  It was like that boring.
[01:54:56.881 --> 01:54:58.562]  Like, what is going on here?
[01:54:58.602 --> 01:55:00.742]  Sounds thrilling, to be honest with you.
[01:55:01.103 --> 01:55:01.643]  Yeah, it's...
[01:55:02.663 --> 01:55:03.964]  It is utter madness.
[01:55:04.004 --> 01:55:04.284]  I don't know.
[01:55:04.324 --> 01:55:05.104]  I can hardly stand it.
[01:55:05.184 --> 01:55:12.988]  I can only stand it knowing that I am broadcasting to an audience of potentially millions and mocking Chuck Schumer to his face.
[01:55:13.068 --> 01:55:14.648]  Otherwise, how could you listen to that guy talk?
[01:55:14.929 --> 01:55:15.549]  How could you listen to him?
[01:55:15.569 --> 01:55:16.609]  Did you take calls today in the war room?
[01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.250]  No.
[01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:21.712]  I was going to take calls right now, but we didn't really have time before the speeches started.
[01:55:22.012 --> 01:55:24.613]  I tell you what, we could throw up the lines of the crews down to do it.
[01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:26.394]  I always love throwing curveballs to the crew.
[01:55:26.414 --> 01:55:28.915]  You know, because they're not working hard enough.
[01:55:31.404 --> 01:55:46.981]  One thing I noticed about the callers this morning is that a lot of them called in and said that there's no way they could have watched the DNC had InfoWars not covered it with Jones doing just, you know, Team America and Transformers clips intermittently throughout because it was just so unbearable.
[01:55:47.561 --> 01:55:47.922]  It is.
[01:55:48.062 --> 01:55:51.245]  I mean, there's no Hulkster tearing his shirt off, you know?
[01:55:51.285 --> 01:55:53.487]  Right, but there was that one lame-o taking his jacket off.
[01:55:54.008 --> 01:55:54.688]  I didn't even see that.
[01:55:54.809 --> 01:55:55.129]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:55.269 --> 01:55:58.572]  There's a guy that was wearing a blazer and he just took it off and revealed that he had a t-shirt on.
[01:55:58.853 --> 01:56:02.476]  It was so off-brand, RNC, and I thought RNC was off-brand convention.
[01:56:03.017 --> 01:56:04.418]  Like, it was like off-brand, off-brand.
[01:56:04.458 --> 01:56:05.920]  It wasn't even Diet Coke.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:07.862]  It was like Diet Bright.
[01:56:08.102 --> 01:56:09.003]  Here's my question, though.
[01:56:09.343 --> 01:56:10.064]  How do you
[01:56:11.397 --> 01:56:13.539]  How do Democrats, like what are they doing?
[01:56:13.579 --> 01:56:20.084]  When you look at the DNC, they've got signs that say freedom and they're all waving signs that say USA.
[01:56:21.525 --> 01:56:23.066]  How do they do this mentally?
[01:56:23.146 --> 01:56:26.569]  How do they like turn on and off their patriotism on a whim?
[01:56:26.609 --> 01:56:29.191]  Well, they turn on and off every principle on a whim.
[01:56:29.531 --> 01:56:35.515]  So they love democracy when it's conducive to their political success, but they hate it when it means Donald Trump gets to be on a ballot, right?
[01:56:35.916 --> 01:56:37.257]  They love things like
[01:56:39.793 --> 01:56:41.134]  Yeah, well we got Alex Jones in the studio.
[01:56:41.154 --> 01:56:41.854]  I'm getting out of the chair.
[01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:46.117]  Alex Jones in the studio.
[01:56:46.137 --> 01:56:49.199]  Behavioral psychologists run all this for at least 70 years.
[01:56:49.799 --> 01:56:52.561]  The Democrats are fully committed to full deception, full warfare.
[01:56:53.382 --> 01:56:56.844]  So they know most of their constituents, like Hillary famously said, Dick Morris, are idiots.
[01:56:57.484 --> 01:56:58.145]  They're emotional.
[01:56:58.285 --> 01:57:00.907]  Or they're part of the system making money off it and think they're part of the power structure.
[01:57:00.927 --> 01:57:01.607]  There's different types.
[01:57:01.967 --> 01:57:05.370]  But the low-level are just useful idiots, as Lennon called them.
[01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:08.912]  And so what they do is they know that they can just flip emotions on and off
[01:57:10.242 --> 01:57:11.563]  They don't remember losing.
[01:57:11.683 --> 01:57:12.003]  Right.
[01:57:40.502 --> 01:57:42.383]  Wow, so the whole entire party is just in Stockholm.
[01:57:42.403 --> 01:57:47.526]  Half the nation is in the state of Stockholm Syndrome, which basically just gives them the characterization of non-player character.
[01:57:48.927 --> 01:57:51.548]  A third of the nation is in Stockholm Syndrome of the Democrats.
[01:57:52.088 --> 01:57:55.170]  A third of the nation knows Republicans aren't perfect, but are awake and getting more awake.
[01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:56.571]  A third's not been voting.
[01:57:57.511 --> 01:57:57.831]  Roughly.
[01:57:57.971 --> 01:58:02.314]  If you average midterms and national elections, it averages about 60% or so.
[01:58:03.746 --> 01:58:12.889]  So it's that 30% that's dialed out and either doesn't care or has given up that we've got to go recruit and wake up to understand that we can override the fraud and win or they're fucked.
[01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:15.470]  Well there you have it, Alex Jones.
[01:58:18.533 --> 01:58:22.978]  Yeah, and I just, you know, it's the type of thing where it's like, are they lying or are they wrong?
[01:58:23.118 --> 01:58:24.579]  Are they stupid or are they evil?
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:26.702]  And it's, I guess that's the only question, right?
[01:58:26.722 --> 01:58:27.142]  They're both.
[01:58:27.302 --> 01:58:29.585]  I mean, well, it's like what Jones said.
[01:58:29.625 --> 01:58:34.590]  If you have Stockholm Syndrome, you're not necessarily evil, you're a victim of massive psychological abuse.
[01:58:34.690 --> 01:58:35.411]  Yeah, but that's the question.
[01:58:35.431 --> 01:58:42.916]  Like, when people see them waving the USA side, do they know that's a cynical, you know, blatant falsehood attempt to appear patriotic when you're not?
[01:58:43.396 --> 01:58:44.777]  Are they convinced that that's real?
[01:58:44.837 --> 01:58:48.880]  I mean, I just wonder, like, is the average Democrat, do they buy into this?
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:52.743]  Or are they, they just get that it's a, it's a lie and they don't care because they just want power?
[01:58:54.504 --> 01:58:57.065]  Frankly, I tend to go to the latter.
[01:58:57.525 --> 01:58:58.985]  Well, I think it depends on who you're looking at.
[01:58:59.025 --> 01:59:02.266]  Like, if you're looking at an average voter, then I see a victim.
[01:59:02.306 --> 01:59:02.666]  I just don't know.
[01:59:02.686 --> 01:59:06.767]  But if you're looking at a member of the political class, then I see perpetrator or predator, right?
[01:59:07.747 --> 01:59:08.928]  Or frankly, just assailant.
[01:59:08.988 --> 01:59:12.549]  And this is one of the things that has traditionally been different about the right versus the left, man.
[01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:17.690]  Like, if you look at the way... Yeah, so this is live outside.
[01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:18.650]  This is live outside.
[01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:21.191]  We're watching some pretty intense
[01:59:24.506 --> 01:59:25.706]  Roundups going on here.
[01:59:26.687 --> 01:59:28.307]  I mean, this is Democracy Manifest.
[01:59:28.567 --> 01:59:29.927]  Chicago's always kind of been like this.
[01:59:30.207 --> 01:59:32.488]  I'm enjoying that this is happening.
[01:59:33.288 --> 01:59:40.270]  That you've got phalanx of militarized police, you know, fighting with foreign nationals, burning the American flag.
[01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:41.630]  What's in the fanny packs?
[01:59:43.251 --> 01:59:44.811]  It's the... Like tear gas?
[01:59:47.032 --> 01:59:47.732]  Wow, this is wild.
[01:59:47.752 --> 01:59:48.392]  Do we have any audio?
[01:59:49.512 --> 01:59:51.733]  They are using, like, the same helmets from, like,
[01:59:53.058 --> 01:59:58.402]  1968, this is the instant replay of this.
[01:59:58.422 --> 01:59:59.302]  He said something.
[01:59:59.483 --> 02:00:00.743]  He snagged that guy.
[02:00:00.763 --> 02:00:01.824]  But all at the same time.
[02:00:01.964 --> 02:00:03.105]  He must have issued a threat.
[02:00:05.767 --> 02:00:07.268]  Assuming the cops were following protocol.
[02:00:09.029 --> 02:00:09.990]  It's all just orchestrated.
[02:00:11.072 --> 02:00:12.393]  You think that the protests were orchestrated?
[02:00:12.893 --> 02:00:20.218]  Yeah, I mean you've got big money Democrats paying for the protesters, probably coordinating with the police, telling them exactly where to go.
[02:00:20.518 --> 02:00:24.000]  But why would you pay for protesters at your own convention?
[02:00:25.161 --> 02:00:26.522]  Because they're chaos agents.
[02:00:27.262 --> 02:00:31.327]  I mean, all of the Palestinian protests are pretty well funded by Democrats.
[02:00:31.567 --> 02:00:32.348]  That's what we should do.
[02:00:32.548 --> 02:00:40.036]  After all this lawsuit stuff is over, we should pay people to stand outside the studio here and protest us so that we get massive coverage all the time.
[02:00:42.816 --> 02:00:47.637]  This is a tweet I did a couple days ago, just trying to think about what Alex and us were just talking about.
[02:00:48.417 --> 02:00:53.118]  So the champions of democracy, right, the Democrats, who happen to... Their name is literally named after democracy.
[02:00:53.138 --> 02:00:55.839]  Their name is, but they didn't cast a single vote for their candidate.
[02:00:56.179 --> 02:00:56.339]  Right.
[02:00:56.459 --> 02:00:58.399]  They've adopted the phrase, mind your own business.
[02:00:58.739 --> 02:01:09.622]  That's what Tim Walz keeps saying and getting big cheers, mind your own business, despite the VP's stand, the potential VP's standout act as governor being a snitch line for people to report their neighbors for suggesting CDC guidelines.
[02:01:09.902 --> 02:01:10.102]  Yes.
[02:01:10.302 --> 02:01:15.703]  They've started calling MAGA supporters weird, despite their entire ideology being built on letting little boys wear dresses.
[02:01:16.164 --> 02:01:19.484]  They're claiming they can fix the economy that they are currently administrating.
[02:01:19.965 --> 02:01:25.386]  They are pro-ceasefire in Gaza, but just sent another $23.5 billion to Israel.
[02:01:25.726 --> 02:01:32.848]  They haven't come out with any policy proposals, but the policy proposals they keep criticizing are a set that aren't even Trump's and that he has repeatedly disavowed.
[02:01:33.348 --> 02:01:34.149]  We're good to go.
[02:01:56.714 --> 02:01:57.315]  I wanted you to know.
[02:01:57.455 --> 02:01:58.436]  That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
[02:01:58.857 --> 02:02:14.175]  They're running on, they're actually, you know, have these big meetings of white men for Kamala, so they're actually advocating for white men, border security, law and order, and the economy, despite spending the last decade destroying the economy, defunding the police, opening the border, and cheering on white genocide.
[02:02:14.195 --> 02:02:16.017]  Plus, can you imagine if there was white men for Trump?
[02:02:17.072 --> 02:02:18.433]  Uh, yes, I'm one of them.
[02:02:19.114 --> 02:02:19.534]  You guys exist?
[02:02:19.554 --> 02:02:20.094]  I think there should be.
[02:02:20.495 --> 02:02:20.775]  Yeah.
[02:02:21.075 --> 02:02:22.716]  I don't know, like a formal Zoom meeting?
[02:02:22.796 --> 02:02:23.577]  White men for Trump?
[02:02:23.737 --> 02:02:24.738]  I would love to get one together.
[02:02:24.758 --> 02:02:26.259]  They would just berate that as, like, white supremacy.
[02:02:26.499 --> 02:02:26.759]  Let them.
[02:02:27.419 --> 02:02:27.880]  I understand.
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:29.101]  That's the hypocrisy.
[02:02:29.161 --> 02:02:30.682]  How can you have white men for Kamala?
[02:02:30.862 --> 02:02:31.122]  I know.
[02:02:31.342 --> 02:02:32.563]  Kamala, whatever the hell her name is.
[02:02:32.623 --> 02:02:36.786]  And that's what Charlie Kirk was like, um, so does this mean that we can do white men for Trump?
[02:02:36.826 --> 02:02:37.947]  And it's like, you could always do that.
[02:02:38.327 --> 02:02:39.108]  You could always do that.
[02:02:39.608 --> 02:02:40.469]  Of course they'll call you names.
[02:02:40.489 --> 02:02:41.289]  They call you names anyway.
[02:02:41.649 --> 02:02:41.769]  Right.
[02:02:41.789 --> 02:02:42.310]  It doesn't matter.
[02:02:42.330 --> 02:02:43.030]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[02:02:43.050 --> 02:02:43.731]  No, it doesn't matter at all.
[02:02:44.765 --> 02:02:46.947]  And, uh, you know, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:02:47.007 --> 02:02:54.451]  Like, to list the number of examples of cognitive dissonance in the Democratic Party, it's impossible because by the time you're done listing them, there's new ones.
[02:02:54.471 --> 02:02:57.873]  And then when you point out the cognitive dissonance, they have cognitive dissonance about that, so it's like layered.
[02:02:57.893 --> 02:02:58.494]  They get mad at you.
[02:02:58.734 --> 02:02:59.935]  They have, like, dimensional...
[02:03:00.555 --> 02:03:05.959]  Cognitive dissonance where they're dissonant on one plane, and then when you escalate to a higher plane of thinking, they're in a fugue state.
[02:03:05.999 --> 02:03:09.402]  Yeah, it's like, you have to, you have, it's like they're legion.
[02:03:09.422 --> 02:03:15.187]  They're all possessed by legion, and you have to figure out a way to get every demon out, otherwise they still remain in a state of possessed.
[02:03:15.267 --> 02:03:19.310]  Yeah, well it's like, it's like what I always say, it's a conspiracy fractal pattern.
[02:03:19.330 --> 02:03:21.151]  The more you zoom out, the more it looks exactly the same.
[02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:27.937]  It's an endlessly repeating loop of cognitive dissonance that will never end, and they just have to be defeated.
[02:03:28.377 --> 02:03:50.623]  Well, and what I was trying to say before Alex came in and made some great points was, traditionally one of the differences between Republicans and Democrats, and I felt this personally, I'm sure that you have too Harris, I think we've even talked about this, is that Republicans for the most part, and this is ceasing to be true in real time, intentionally using a gerund there, ceasing to be true, for a long time Republicans
[02:03:51.624 --> 02:04:02.088]  Would not lose respect for anyone whom they encountered based on who they voted for, but they would maintain the sense of loathing for the person that they voted for, right?
[02:04:02.108 --> 02:04:08.811]  So you could absolutely hate Barack Obama, but have no problem with your neighbor who you knew voted for Barack Obama, right?
[02:04:08.931 --> 02:04:15.373]  There was like an understanding that just because you think this person is evil doesn't mean that the person who supported them is evil.
[02:04:15.433 --> 02:04:19.855]  They were just, they were misunderstanding was kind of the benefit of the doubt that you give your neighbor.
[02:04:20.615 --> 02:04:20.775]  Yeah.
[02:04:52.497 --> 02:05:10.511]  One of the main factors that has contributed to my belief that there is a fundamental moral difference between right-leaning people and left-leaning people in the country, because we all know that we're wrong about something, but nobody knows what they're wrong about, otherwise they would cease to be wrong about it.
[02:05:10.551 --> 02:05:11.612]  They would just correct, right?
[02:05:11.893 --> 02:05:16.676]  It's much easier for you to see where I'm a moron than it is for me to see where I'm a moron.
[02:05:16.696 --> 02:05:18.478]  It's much easier for me to see where you're stupid than it
[02:05:18.558 --> 02:05:19.978]  You know, it's just the nature of it is.
[02:05:20.218 --> 02:05:33.903]  And so you give that benefit of the doubt, but when you have this disparity in the way that oppositional ideas are treated by among those who embody those ideas, then you can see the moral difference.
[02:05:33.943 --> 02:05:44.906]  And so that's one of the reasons, that's one of the tools that I use to zoom out and say, all right, am I just part of like the opposite cult, but also a cult that's just as bad as the people that I oppose?
[02:05:45.006 --> 02:05:45.326]  No, no, no.
[02:05:45.906 --> 02:05:50.688]  Because the way they treat me for what I believe is different from the way that I treat them for what they believe.
[02:05:50.708 --> 02:06:01.613]  So even if I'm logically wrong, I'm still morally on the high ground, which means that I'm less likely to have malicious intent behind my beliefs than this leftist philosophy, right?
[02:06:01.653 --> 02:06:13.298]  And it just seems like proof in and of itself, or evidence at least in and of itself, that there's something much less malicious about conservatism on a general scale than there is about leftism on a general scale.
[02:06:14.437 --> 02:06:15.358]  Yeah, I think you nailed it.
[02:06:15.398 --> 02:06:24.784]  No, the classic phrase is, you know, what is it, conservatives think liberals are wrong because they're stupid and liberals think conservatives are evil, right?
[02:06:24.804 --> 02:06:27.306]  That really is the distinction.
[02:06:27.426 --> 02:06:29.948]  And it's humility and respect.
[02:06:30.288 --> 02:06:30.989]  I think you're exactly right.
[02:06:31.009 --> 02:06:32.530]  I think you've hit the nail on the head.
[02:06:33.250 --> 02:06:34.972]  So basically we should just line them all up.
[02:06:35.772 --> 02:06:37.994]  I mean... I'm just kidding.
[02:06:38.554 --> 02:06:39.055]  Politically.
[02:06:39.415 --> 02:06:40.956]  Line them all up for snow cones.
[02:06:40.996 --> 02:06:41.877]  That's what we're saying.
[02:06:41.937 --> 02:06:42.337]  Politically.
[02:06:43.311 --> 02:06:52.358]  No, I think, yeah, I think, look, it's a million, there's a million different ways that conservatives are evidently morally superior to liberals.
[02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:54.120]  Like, it just doesn't even matter.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:07:03.107]  Just the sheer fact that there's so many people that are pro-Trump but complain about Trump and will talk badly about Trump and will, you know, say what they dislike about Trump.
[02:07:04.321 --> 02:07:11.105]  Democrats all hated Kamala Harris up until they were told to like her and now they all freaking love her and worship at her feet.
[02:07:11.406 --> 02:07:11.566]  Yeah.
[02:07:11.686 --> 02:07:14.808]  They really- Literally within like 30 minutes.
[02:07:14.928 --> 02:07:15.148]  Yeah.
[02:07:15.248 --> 02:07:16.649]  No, it was, it was, it's a switch.
[02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:17.650]  It was a switch.
[02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:18.010]  Crazy.
[02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.871]  Just like Jones said.
[02:07:19.151 --> 02:07:19.291]  Yeah.
[02:07:20.103 --> 02:07:21.564]  Yeah, so... The Harry Sissons.
[02:07:21.604 --> 02:07:22.424]  Joe Biden's perfect.
[02:07:22.504 --> 02:07:23.905]  Oh my God, he's a hero for stepping down.
[02:07:24.205 --> 02:07:24.906]  Joe Biden's gonna win.
[02:07:24.926 --> 02:07:26.527]  Oh my God, he saved the country by stepping down.
[02:07:26.587 --> 02:07:29.008]  Like, he literally just said the opposite thing within 45 minutes.
[02:07:29.028 --> 02:07:29.568]  Are you retarded?
[02:07:29.748 --> 02:07:29.888]  Yeah.
[02:07:30.129 --> 02:07:32.270]  No, yeah, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:35.131]  It's all very simple cult program, like Alex was saying.
[02:07:36.072 --> 02:07:37.933]  These programs are run by psychologists.
[02:07:38.493 --> 02:07:46.318]  Empowered by AI who can enter in, you know, different scenarios and simulate the results and then choose their path based on that.
[02:07:46.758 --> 02:07:52.501]  And it's all, it's all very, very sophisticated and it deals with, you know, crowd, basically crowd dynamics.
[02:07:53.762 --> 02:07:57.984]  You can, you can very successfully predict what large crowds of people are going to do.
[02:07:58.024 --> 02:07:59.725]  The bigger the crowd, the easier it is to predict.
[02:07:59.745 --> 02:08:05.989]  You remember when they said that believing mass formation psychosis was a thing, was a form of mass formation psychosis?
[02:08:06.509 --> 02:08:10.993]  I remember when they banned him for using the words mass... That's what they said though, remember?
[02:08:11.454 --> 02:08:17.680]  They said, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, it's like a psychological phenomenon that so many people believe in mass formation.
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.021]  That's what we're saying it is.
[02:08:19.761 --> 02:08:21.423]  That's sort of a, yeah, great example.
[02:08:21.523 --> 02:08:28.429]  A great example of sort of pure cognitive dissonance, where it's like, okay, so you can't believe, you're supposed to not believe in
[02:08:29.190 --> 02:08:34.573]  Mass formation psychosis because believing in mass formation psychosis is mass formation psychosis.
[02:08:34.593 --> 02:08:38.076]  These conspiracy theorists don't believe that Trump faked his own assassination.
[02:08:38.396 --> 02:08:40.437]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:08:40.677 --> 02:08:45.280]  These conspiracy theorists are all involved in secret meetings where they plan what they're gonna say.
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.742]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:48.202 --> 02:08:51.764]  Conspiracies about the conspiracies and the cognitive dissonance never ends.
[02:08:52.665 --> 02:08:55.306]  I don't recognize anybody that's talking right now.
[02:08:55.486 --> 02:08:56.647]  I don't recognize you either.
[02:08:56.887 --> 02:08:57.748]  You have the list here.
[02:08:58.294 --> 02:08:59.134]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:08:59.154 --> 02:09:00.115]  Do I have a list of the speakers?
[02:09:00.595 --> 02:09:01.535]  Somewhere on the desk?
[02:09:01.575 --> 02:09:03.036]  I don't think they published the whole list.
[02:09:03.356 --> 02:09:05.737]  As of late this afternoon, they hadn't published the whole list.
[02:09:05.817 --> 02:09:08.217]  I keep thinking I see John Podesta.
[02:09:08.457 --> 02:09:10.458]  He's everywhere, man.
[02:09:10.478 --> 02:09:11.518]  I wake up at 2 a.m.
[02:09:11.538 --> 02:09:11.939]  sometimes.
[02:09:12.039 --> 02:09:13.059]  Flashes up in my eyes.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:15.360]  Who is this guy?
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:16.920]  Hold on, he's very animated.
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:18.781]  Let's just hear like 10 seconds of him.
[02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:19.481]  We can pull away.
[02:09:19.541 --> 02:09:23.082]  I feel more at home here than in today's Republican Party.
[02:09:23.102 --> 02:09:23.903]  Uh-oh, he's out.
[02:09:23.983 --> 02:09:24.263]  He's out.
[02:09:24.403 --> 02:09:24.723]  Turncoat.
[02:09:27.086 --> 02:09:27.306]  Yes!
[02:09:27.366 --> 02:09:27.906]  Oh my God.
[02:09:27.946 --> 02:09:29.227]  John Giles is an Arizona mayor.
[02:09:29.447 --> 02:09:30.587]  They love mayors.
[02:09:30.607 --> 02:09:31.888]  They love Mayor Pete.
[02:09:31.968 --> 02:09:33.668]  They love all the mayors.
[02:09:33.688 --> 02:09:34.548]  Look at that guy.
[02:09:34.568 --> 02:09:35.068]  Oh my God.
[02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:52.011]  What the hell are they talking about?
[02:09:52.031 --> 02:09:53.392]  We're on the cusp of World War 3.
[02:09:53.472 --> 02:09:53.892]  What?
[02:09:54.212 --> 02:09:54.673]  Oh my God.
[02:09:54.693 --> 02:09:56.734]  They always want to bring him here.
[02:09:56.814 --> 02:09:57.695]  Oh my God.
[02:09:57.715 --> 02:09:57.895]  I know.
[02:09:57.915 --> 02:09:58.596]  He's wanting me over.
[02:09:58.616 --> 02:09:59.416]  He's wanting me over.
[02:10:07.104 --> 02:10:09.806]  Who watches the DNC and changes their minds?
[02:10:09.826 --> 02:10:14.328]  I'm changing my mind about continuing my existence.
[02:10:14.388 --> 02:10:17.589]  Yeah, I've never had suicidal thoughts until now.
[02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:20.971]  I had to break through during the Schumer speech.
[02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:24.072]  Oh, Schumer was tonight.
[02:10:24.112 --> 02:10:24.593]  That's right.
[02:10:24.633 --> 02:10:25.193]  How did that go?
[02:10:25.633 --> 02:10:29.595]  Oh, it was... He walked up there and was like, listen, this is how you make a perfect burger.
[02:10:29.895 --> 02:10:30.335]  Exactly.
[02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:31.136]  That's what I was saying.
[02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:34.237]  You put four minutes on one side, four minutes on the other, throw the cheese on at the end.
[02:10:34.257 --> 02:10:35.198]  That's what I was trying to do.
[02:10:36.741 --> 02:10:39.523]  Yeah, he was about as good at pumping up the crowd as he was at cooking burgers.
[02:10:40.463 --> 02:10:41.204]  Uh, yeah.
[02:10:41.244 --> 02:10:42.045]  I mean, this is the thing.
[02:10:42.085 --> 02:10:46.267]  It's like... Look, we just gotta laugh at this.
[02:10:46.628 --> 02:10:48.109]  At a certain point, you just have to laugh.
[02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:55.694]  They're up there talking about world peace, talking about closed borders, talking about economic success.
[02:10:55.794 --> 02:10:56.014]  I mean...
[02:10:58.019 --> 02:11:03.983]  They just wouldn't be able to get away with this if it wasn't for a totally ignorant and, frankly, stupid populist.
[02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:05.844]  They shouldn't be able to get away with this.
[02:11:05.884 --> 02:11:08.365]  They shouldn't be able to say this stuff and have people take them seriously.
[02:11:09.366 --> 02:11:10.266]  The border, really?
[02:11:10.366 --> 02:11:13.388]  They're saying that the border is secure under Joe Biden?
[02:11:13.408 --> 02:11:15.930]  Yeah, at a certain point.
[02:11:16.857 --> 02:11:17.878]  Like we get what we deserve.
[02:11:18.258 --> 02:11:21.980]  If they can sit up there and say the border was more secure under Biden than Trump.
[02:11:22.681 --> 02:11:30.365]  I mean, honestly, we should have known about, I don't know, 12 weeks into the pandemic that something was really psychologically wrong with the people to fall for.
[02:11:30.405 --> 02:11:43.493]  Because even looking at the daily death numbers, if you analyze the data and compared it to historical data accounting for flu deaths as well, which were eradicated for a year for some reason, then it was abundantly clear that, yes, there was some
[02:11:45.239 --> 02:11:49.782]  Very minute escalation in deaths, but it was not substantial.
[02:11:50.242 --> 02:11:52.484]  Nothing worth shutting down the economy over.
[02:11:52.524 --> 02:11:54.885]  And doing that actually accomplishes nothing at all.
[02:11:54.925 --> 02:11:59.048]  I mean, every 1% that unemployment goes up, 40,000 people in America die.
[02:11:59.068 --> 02:12:10.015]  So if you account for all the people that lost their businesses, the stress-related heart attacks, the people that didn't go to cancer exams, mammograms, things of that nature, because everything was locked down and elective operations and things were canceled.
[02:12:10.235 --> 02:12:11.896]  And all this was obvious from the beginning.
[02:12:12.076 --> 02:12:14.319]  Like, nobody had— Within, like, a handful of weeks.
[02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:20.327]  Like, now, you know, they're writing these articles going, gee, it turns out that shutting down schools for a year— Makes kids retarded.
[02:12:20.427 --> 02:12:22.831]  Or if kids can't see your face, they don't pronounce words right.
[02:12:22.931 --> 02:12:23.432]  Like, no shit.
[02:12:23.452 --> 02:12:23.752]  Oh, really?
[02:12:23.852 --> 02:12:23.992]  Really?
[02:12:24.012 --> 02:12:26.496]  Because you kicked us off the internet for saying that a year ago.
[02:12:26.516 --> 02:12:28.138]  Uh, no, you know—
[02:12:29.079 --> 02:12:29.639]  We're good to go.
[02:12:46.889 --> 02:12:51.351]  But again, it's like, you know, Nancy Pelosi is out there going, Trump hates Chinese people.
[02:12:51.391 --> 02:12:53.371]  Go out and hug your Chinese friend.
[02:12:53.831 --> 02:12:57.933]  And then like two weeks later, they're going, Trump should have shut down the border with China.
[02:12:57.973 --> 02:13:05.195]  It's like they speed ran it in the sense of things they were saying one week, they would say the completely opposite the next week and nobody would bat an eye.
[02:13:05.556 --> 02:13:11.318]  And they're, you know, locking down hospitals while allowing hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets in L.A.
[02:13:11.338 --> 02:13:14.659]  for George Floyd and actually saying it made the virus go down somehow.
[02:13:15.239 --> 02:13:19.503]  And it was things like that where, and again, it just gets to basic cult psychology.
[02:13:19.623 --> 02:13:28.351]  This is a phenomenon where cults will say deliberately absurd things as a form of bringing the cult members closer.
[02:13:28.612 --> 02:13:33.236]  There's something psychological that when you go along with a ridiculous lie, you're in.
[02:13:33.436 --> 02:13:35.278]  You're more dedicated than ever.
[02:13:35.438 --> 02:13:37.120]  And the same thing that happens with cults where
[02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:40.801]  It's, you know, cults don't abuse people outside of the cult.
[02:13:40.841 --> 02:13:41.922]  They abuse their own people.
[02:13:42.162 --> 02:13:45.263]  Because again, just like Stockholm Syndrome, there's some weird human psychology.
[02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:47.004]  That's why I want you to get in, so they can abuse you.
[02:13:47.064 --> 02:13:48.644]  They don't abuse you like when you're like, you know.
[02:13:48.944 --> 02:13:53.886]  And cult members get abused and then say, thank you, wow, you really taught me a lesson, I'll be better from now on.
[02:13:53.926 --> 02:13:56.307]  So it's all just cult programming psychology.
[02:13:56.688 --> 02:14:04.571]  It's the same psychology that is, you know, interpersonally, if you have an abusive relationship between a husband and a wife, it's the exact same mechanisms at work.
[02:14:05.071 --> 02:14:08.154]  You ever listen to the Jim Jones tapes?
[02:14:08.655 --> 02:14:08.915]  Oh yeah.
[02:14:09.816 --> 02:14:15.803]  I mean, I did a report on it when I was in college, so that was the first time I actually heard the tapes.
[02:14:16.727 --> 02:14:21.171]  They recorded the audio of the suicides, Jim did, or somebody.
[02:14:21.351 --> 02:14:26.736]  And you have somebody, at that moment, standing up and saying, I don't think this is a good idea, I don't think we should kill ourselves.
[02:14:27.076 --> 02:14:28.958]  And she's booed by everybody around her.
[02:14:29.018 --> 02:14:29.979]  Everybody around her, boo!
[02:14:30.079 --> 02:14:31.500]  He says, don't cry.
[02:14:32.061 --> 02:14:33.422]  Don't cry, little children.
[02:14:33.763 --> 02:14:34.864]  It's not sad.
[02:14:35.504 --> 02:14:39.205]  And he's like, he's like on the verge of tears because he's seeing his followers cry.
[02:14:39.725 --> 02:14:40.945]  Not because he's going to commit suicide.
[02:14:40.985 --> 02:14:44.406]  Like it's, it is, it is one of the most disturbing pieces of audio.
[02:14:44.426 --> 02:14:51.328]  I remember I played it for the speech that I had to give in college and my teacher literally gasped listening to it.
[02:14:51.348 --> 02:14:54.429]  She did the whole like, you know, feminine, like, just like tear thing.
[02:14:55.257 --> 02:14:56.458]  And it was tense.
[02:14:57.219 --> 02:15:10.311]  People don't understand and one of the things I think so dangerous and just terrifying about everything that we're talking about in terms of psychological operations and manipulation and mass formation psychosis is people don't realize how
[02:15:11.272 --> 02:15:17.095]  Brand-freaking-new psychology as a field of study is, relative to all the others.
[02:15:17.115 --> 02:15:24.659]  I mean, people have been studying physics for hundreds of years, whether they called it physics or not, mathematics for hundreds of years, scientific method for a long time, right?
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:29.902]  I mean, the method's fairly new if you go to Charles Darwin, but I mean, it's well-established.
[02:15:30.363 --> 02:15:34.545]  Psychology, like, people didn't really start screwing around with that until early 20th century.
[02:15:34.565 --> 02:15:36.366]  We're talking Freud, talking Jung.
[02:15:36.766 --> 02:15:38.507]  And by the way, all of that stuff is defunct now.
[02:15:38.767 --> 02:15:39.908]  It's all defunct.
[02:15:39.948 --> 02:15:46.794]  I mean, people, even if you go to a psychiatrist today, they'll still talk to you about things like penis envy and things like that, which is like Freudian conjecture.
[02:15:47.395 --> 02:15:49.677]  They didn't do studies back then the same way they do now.
[02:15:49.937 --> 02:15:56.103]  People just wrote opinions and then rationalized them as if it was a form of philosophy about the nature of the human mind.
[02:15:56.723 --> 02:16:01.868]  And it was just like standard thought until somebody proved them wrong because they were the first ones in the field.
[02:16:02.268 --> 02:16:05.152]  So it was the first body of work to study and criticize and it was just BS.
[02:16:05.492 --> 02:16:06.414]  People don't realize how new this is.
[02:16:06.434 --> 02:16:14.965]  And when you have a new field of study, whether it's nuclear physics, or psychology, or frankly, or a new political philosophy, which is like Marxism, right?
[02:16:14.985 --> 02:16:19.371]  Like, you don't know what the effects of these beliefs and ideals are gonna have.
[02:16:19.731 --> 02:16:20.111]  I don't know.
[02:16:35.885 --> 02:16:43.831]  World War 2 with MKUltra and he's just like this massive funding into this brand new field of psychology and pharmaceuticals at the same time.
[02:16:43.871 --> 02:16:53.177]  It was like this new field of chemistry and pharmaceuticals mixed with this new field of psychology with an infinite budget and then top secret with no accountability, right?
[02:16:53.437 --> 02:16:57.360]  You just fund the hell out of this very, very questionable moral thing
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:15.867]  With zero accountability, and then what happens is all of a sudden in the second half of the 20th century, we have bombings for the first time on a massive scale, we have mass shootings for the first time on a massive scale, we've got John Lennons and JFK assassinations, and then these people are actually tied back to bases that were associated with MKUltra despite the fact that these documents were destroyed.
[02:17:15.887 --> 02:17:25.831]  Like, we are living in a world that is the outcome of a massive psychological experiment which is still ongoing with very little data.
[02:17:26.391 --> 02:17:29.413]  Tremendous amounts of funding in zero accountability.
[02:17:29.633 --> 02:17:37.879]  And like, that's why you're seeing a DNC where everyone's acting like everything's fine, while on the outside, cops are having to like, raid up people that are wearing very questionable scarves and things like that.
[02:17:37.899 --> 02:17:41.862]  I know that the Israel thing is, you know, controversial, but like, come on, you know?
[02:17:41.882 --> 02:17:44.504]  Yeah, no, you're exactly right.
[02:17:44.564 --> 02:17:47.666]  And again, I say it all the time, but I can never say it enough.
[02:17:48.147 --> 02:17:49.087]  Read the foundation.
[02:17:49.247 --> 02:17:50.588]  You gotta read the foundation.
[02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:52.930]  You gotta read the foundation to understand what's going on in the world today.
[02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:54.771]  You have to read the foundation.
[02:17:55.751 --> 02:18:02.757]  The whole thing is predicated on this novel, new, scientific body of work called psychohistory.
[02:18:03.157 --> 02:18:04.579]  And it's exactly what I was just explaining.
[02:18:04.679 --> 02:18:08.922]  It is the fact that you can predict the outcome, you can predict the responses of crowds.
[02:18:09.243 --> 02:18:12.065]  And the bigger the crowd, the more accurately you can predict the response.
[02:18:12.085 --> 02:18:12.525]  Makes sense.
[02:18:12.645 --> 02:18:14.767]  That's the basis of algorithms on social media.
[02:18:14.867 --> 02:18:15.548]  Yep, yep.
[02:18:16.869 --> 02:18:18.550]  And this is what they're doing.
[02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:32.400]  And so, yeah, the field of psychology was new and untested, but they were able to find very, very powerful truths out about humanity, about the way fear can be used, about the way isolation can be used, about the way all of these things can be used.
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.402]  Again, the testing happened literally with Jim Jones.
[02:18:35.442 --> 02:18:38.724]  I mean, Jim Jones was a CIA MKUltra operation.
[02:18:38.744 --> 02:18:39.605]  He was definitely MKUltra.
[02:18:39.685 --> 02:18:39.845]  Yeah.
[02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:42.468]  Helping that guy full of drugs and give him aviators?
[02:18:42.508 --> 02:18:43.229]  Sounds familiar.
[02:18:43.249 --> 02:18:44.111]  Yep.
[02:18:44.131 --> 02:18:45.493]  Or depopulation cult?
[02:18:45.693 --> 02:18:46.474]  Sounds familiar.
[02:18:48.297 --> 02:18:53.604]  Infiltrating and cloaking yourself in Christianity while actually working behind the scenes to dismantle Christianity through communism.
[02:18:54.025 --> 02:18:54.365]  In fact...
[02:18:55.230 --> 02:19:04.702]  This is a great topic to bring up now because he was tied in very intimately with politicians in San Francisco where Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris first got their start.
[02:19:05.142 --> 02:19:06.784]  He was tied in with Dianne Feinstein.
[02:19:06.884 --> 02:19:09.347]  I'm pretty sure he was tied in with Willie Brown as well.
[02:19:10.008 --> 02:19:14.634]  So their whole thing, their whole thing was that Trump had, I mean, Trump, Jim Jones had a big following.
[02:19:15.742 --> 02:19:16.282]  We're good to go.
[02:19:35.493 --> 02:19:38.654]  I mean, the people doing the fake healing were the cult members.
[02:19:38.794 --> 02:19:44.815]  And, you know, it's one of the things, like, people who got out would go, yeah, I kept going to their, you know, services.
[02:19:44.875 --> 02:19:45.635]  Phil had cancer.
[02:19:45.855 --> 02:19:48.055]  It was the same person getting healed every time.
[02:19:48.075 --> 02:19:49.136]  Oh, no way.
[02:19:49.156 --> 02:19:50.156]  I didn't know that fact.
[02:19:50.236 --> 02:19:50.996]  Yeah, they make it obvious.
[02:19:51.416 --> 02:19:53.656]  I think cults, they do things that are obvious.
[02:19:53.776 --> 02:19:54.857]  They do things that are obviously true.
[02:19:54.877 --> 02:19:56.877]  They almost want it to be obvious because it's like a shit test.
[02:19:57.057 --> 02:19:59.918]  It's like, yes, it's like how... Like, how in are you?
[02:20:00.138 --> 02:20:01.758]  How when spam emails...
[02:20:02.478 --> 02:20:02.618]  I don't
[02:20:18.353 --> 02:20:22.035]  Yeah, they don't want smart, intelligent, you know, people with good families.
[02:20:22.075 --> 02:20:29.000]  They want like, just like any predator, they want somebody who nobody cares about, they want somebody who's kind of stupid, who is desperate, who needs help.
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:30.821]  Let's just get sued by somebody else.
[02:20:30.861 --> 02:20:32.602]  The Church of Scientology did the same exact thing.
[02:20:32.842 --> 02:20:43.689]  I mean, they intentionally, I know that they're famous for targeting celebrities and they have been successful in that because they go for this like high net worth endowment method on one end, but the vast majority of their members are like former drug addicts.
[02:20:44.049 --> 02:20:44.970]  I know a Scientologist
[02:20:45.731 --> 02:20:50.398]  And a very serious Scientologist who he's a really good guy, right?
[02:20:50.739 --> 02:20:51.680]  Obviously, he's in a cult.
[02:20:52.081 --> 02:20:57.469]  He's got a little bit of like, you know, a vacant stare and when he talks about it, like you can tell there's something wrong.
[02:20:59.033 --> 02:21:00.794]  Otherwise, totally a good dude, right?
[02:21:01.574 --> 02:21:11.237]  And he said, you know, like, Scientology cured me of alcoholism and drug abuse, and I believe him, but like, but you have to volunteer like 40 hours a week, and why do you have 5,000 copies of Dianetics in your living room?
[02:21:11.257 --> 02:21:11.677]  You know what I mean?
[02:21:12.138 --> 02:21:15.099]  So anyway, Doug is coming out apparently, so let's cut to this.
[02:21:15.539 --> 02:21:18.980]  I'm sorry, the second gentleman, Chase, the second gentleman is taking the stage.
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.781]  I guess he didn't want me to give this speech.
[02:21:24.802 --> 02:21:26.462]  Thank you, thank you so much.
[02:21:27.103 --> 02:21:27.523]  Hello!
[02:21:29.417 --> 02:21:29.977]  Thank you.
[02:21:34.378 --> 02:21:39.119]  Hello to my big, beautiful, blended family up there.
[02:21:39.379 --> 02:21:39.839]  Blended?
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.800]  I love you so much.
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:45.160]  Aren't you proud of Cole?
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:45.721]  Wow!
[02:21:48.101 --> 02:21:50.862]  And a special shout out to my mother.
[02:21:50.882 --> 02:21:52.182]  I see you.
[02:21:53.924 --> 02:21:58.466]  Shout out to your mom, Doug.
[02:21:58.506 --> 02:22:00.486]  Where's your mom?
[02:22:04.888 --> 02:22:08.669]  And to Kamala who, well, we just saw where she is.
[02:22:08.709 --> 02:22:12.530]  She's out on the trail listening to and talking with voters.
[02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:18.772]  Honey, I can't wait for you to come back to Chicago because we're having a great time here.
[02:22:24.386 --> 02:22:26.268]  I love you so much.
[02:22:27.589 --> 02:22:31.492]  I'm so proud of how you're stepping up for all of us.
[02:22:32.312 --> 02:22:33.593]  But that's who she is.
[02:22:34.614 --> 02:22:39.998]  Wherever she's needed, however she's needed, Kamala rises to the occasion.
[02:22:40.819 --> 02:22:42.680]  And she did it for me and our family.
[02:22:43.761 --> 02:22:48.545]  And now that the country needs her, she's showing you what we already know.
[02:22:49.685 --> 02:22:51.067]  She's ready to lead.
[02:22:54.577 --> 02:23:02.845]  She brings both joy and toughness to this task, and she will be a great president you'll all be proud of!
[02:23:07.410 --> 02:23:11.294]  Now I'm the son of two Brooklynites, Mike and Barb.
[02:23:12.635 --> 02:23:14.197]  They've been together almost 70 years.
[02:23:16.733 --> 02:23:19.396]  My dad worked in the shoe business in Manhattan.
[02:23:19.477 --> 02:23:25.003]  I was going to say, it's probably because your dad didn't cheat with the nanny and get her pregnant, Doug.
[02:23:25.864 --> 02:23:29.749]  I see you out there when I was a little kid.
[02:23:29.789 --> 02:23:32.212]  And in a lot of ways,
[02:23:33.334 --> 02:23:36.356]  I had a typical Jersey suburban childhood.
[02:23:37.717 --> 02:23:39.058]  I biked around the neighborhood.
[02:23:39.898 --> 02:23:41.319]  I took the bus to Hebrew School.
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:48.684]  And I rode to Little League practice in the way back of my coach's wood-paneled station wagon.
[02:23:50.425 --> 02:23:53.587]  Hold on, he's talking about being in the back of his coach's wood-paneled station wagon?
[02:23:53.607 --> 02:23:56.549]  What the hell is he talking about?
[02:23:56.589 --> 02:23:57.110]  Was he molested?
[02:23:57.130 --> 02:23:57.690]  It was Sandusky.
[02:23:59.551 --> 02:24:00.452]  Where was the government, though?
[02:24:13.465 --> 02:24:14.225]  I'm confused.
[02:24:14.245 --> 02:24:18.287]  You're promoting... You're promoting the nuclear family with no government intervention?
[02:24:18.307 --> 02:24:18.948]  Yeah, what the hell?
[02:24:18.968 --> 02:24:21.489]  You're saying that people can just take care of themselves and each other?
[02:24:21.769 --> 02:24:24.731]  Yeah, none of these childhood stories have any semblance of government.
[02:24:24.791 --> 02:24:27.332]  Like, the most wholesome, beautiful stories have zero government.
[02:24:27.372 --> 02:24:28.472]  I never noticed that!
[02:24:29.053 --> 02:24:29.813]  Jesus!
[02:24:34.295 --> 02:24:37.737]  So, I worked at McDonald's in high school for some extra cash.
[02:24:38.934 --> 02:24:48.841]  Not only was I Employee of the Month, but I still have the framed picture, which you just saw, and there was a ring, golden arches and all.
[02:24:50.177 --> 02:24:57.459]  And then I waited tables, parked cars, I was working full-time so I could afford to go to college part-time.
[02:24:58.499 --> 02:25:06.242]  And thanks to partial scholarships, student loans, and a little help from my dad, I got myself through law school.
[02:25:06.862 --> 02:25:17.465]  And I got my first job as a lawyer, which is also where I met the guys in my fantasy football league.
[02:25:20.058 --> 02:25:25.461]  A lot has changed in our lives since the early 90s, but my team name is still Nirvana.
[02:25:27.402 --> 02:25:32.045]  Yes, after the ban, I learned hard.
[02:25:32.525 --> 02:25:34.186]  And I love being a lawyer.
[02:25:34.826 --> 02:25:40.029]  And by the way, I still get to be part of the profession by teaching students at Georgetown Law School.
[02:25:42.931 --> 02:25:46.553]  I got married, became a dad to Colin Ella.
[02:25:47.742 --> 02:25:53.927]  Unfortunately, I went through a divorce, cheated on my wife, and eventually started worrying about how I would make it all work.
[02:25:55.007 --> 02:25:57.889]  And that's when something unexpected happened.
[02:25:59.491 --> 02:26:03.734]  In 2013, I walked into a contentious client meeting.
[02:26:04.714 --> 02:26:11.960]  We worked through the issue, and by the end of the meeting, the now happy client offered to set me up on a blind date.
[02:26:13.263 --> 02:26:13.863]  Oh man, he hated you.
[02:26:13.903 --> 02:26:17.784]  Which is how I ended up with Kamala Harris' phone number.
[02:26:17.884 --> 02:26:21.484]  Imagine having a mad client and then you're blind dated with like the Attorney General.
[02:26:21.604 --> 02:26:22.124]  Yeah, right?
[02:26:22.325 --> 02:26:24.065]  Who was your client, George Soros?
[02:26:24.285 --> 02:26:28.886]  People have debated when to call the person you're being set up with.
[02:26:30.126 --> 02:26:35.087]  And never in history has anyone suggested 830 AM.
[02:26:35.187 --> 02:26:38.927]  That's actually a good time to do it.
[02:26:39.147 --> 02:26:42.748]  And yet, that's when I dialed.
[02:26:44.542 --> 02:26:48.943]  I got Kamala's voicemail, and I just started rambling.
[02:26:50.804 --> 02:26:52.224]  Hey, it's Doug.
[02:26:52.244 --> 02:26:53.944]  I'm just talking about Dick Destroyer.
[02:26:53.964 --> 02:26:56.965]  That's the audio from the call.
[02:26:57.425 --> 02:27:06.008]  I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth.
[02:27:07.148 --> 02:27:11.369]  And for what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up.
[02:27:12.819 --> 02:27:15.400]  By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail.
[02:27:16.841 --> 02:27:19.963]  And she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.
[02:27:20.083 --> 02:27:26.846]  Oh my god, she sounds awful.
[02:27:26.906 --> 02:27:29.587]  It's like when a fight is resolved and it comes up six months later.
[02:27:29.687 --> 02:27:36.431]  Kamala, who normally would have been working hard at her office, just happened to be waiting at her apartment for a contract.
[02:27:36.451 --> 02:27:38.071]  Man, imagine getting a blind date.
[02:27:38.091 --> 02:27:41.053]  Your blind date is Willie Brown's sloppy seconds.
[02:27:42.077 --> 02:27:43.198]  Maybe his client was Willie Brown.
[02:27:43.238 --> 02:27:43.718]  Could have been.
[02:27:43.858 --> 02:27:45.219]  And we cackled.
[02:27:45.259 --> 02:27:48.061]  Oh boy, we cackled.
[02:27:48.121 --> 02:27:50.943]  The most wholesome cackling of all cackles ever.
[02:27:51.003 --> 02:27:51.383]  Cackled.
[02:28:08.123 --> 02:28:15.125]  Or maybe it was that Saturday night when I picked her up and told her, buckle up, I'm a really bad driver.
[02:28:15.145 --> 02:28:16.666]  Oh my god.
[02:28:16.686 --> 02:28:20.227]  Because you can't hide anything from Kamala Harris, so you might as well own it.
[02:28:21.648 --> 02:28:25.969]  And as I got to know her better... He's so self-effacing, isn't he?
[02:28:26.009 --> 02:28:27.470]  I just fell in love fast.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.504]  I learned what drives Kamala.
[02:28:32.805 --> 02:28:38.372]  And it's what you've seen over these past four years, and especially these past four weeks.
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:43.762]  She finds joy in pursuing justice.
[02:28:44.442 --> 02:28:47.604]  She stands up to bullies just like my parents taught me to.
[02:28:47.624 --> 02:28:50.025]  And she likes to see people do well.
[02:28:50.045 --> 02:28:51.586]  She picks joy because of the cackle.
[02:28:51.966 --> 02:28:54.868]  Now when you see the cackle, you think joy instead of crazy cackle.
[02:28:54.888 --> 02:28:56.229]  That's why they did it, man.
[02:28:56.269 --> 02:28:58.970]  Basic curiosity in just how people are doing.
[02:28:59.711 --> 02:29:02.092]  Her empathy is her strength.
[02:29:07.345 --> 02:29:14.328]  Over the past decade, Kamala has connected me more deeply to my faith, even though it's not the same as hers.
[02:29:15.388 --> 02:29:20.911]  She comes to synagogue with me for high holiday services, and I go to church with her for Easter.
[02:29:22.071 --> 02:29:29.194]  I get to enjoy her mom's chili relleno recipe every Christmas, and she makes a mean brisket for Passover.
[02:29:29.214 --> 02:29:29.514]  You know?
[02:29:30.634 --> 02:29:31.715]  He was just a guy.
[02:29:31.795 --> 02:29:32.635]  No, no, no.
[02:29:32.695 --> 02:29:33.215]  God's son.
[02:29:33.376 --> 02:29:34.156]  Just a guy.
[02:29:35.401 --> 02:29:39.523]  She's the one who encouraged me, a second gentleman, to take up that fight, which is so personal to me.
[02:29:55.728 --> 02:29:59.109]  This is really resonating with the, uh, you know, Boomer Cuck crowd.
[02:29:59.129 --> 02:30:00.969]  They're really, they're like, he's just like me.
[02:30:01.569 --> 02:30:05.670]  I'm also bad at everything and have an overpowering wife.
[02:30:06.270 --> 02:30:07.850]  He's just like us.
[02:30:08.010 --> 02:30:08.570]  Mama-la.
[02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:13.171]  Ella calls us a three-headed parenting machine.
[02:30:13.271 --> 02:30:13.991]  Oh my god.
[02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:17.092]  Kamala and Kirsten, thank you both.
[02:30:18.092 --> 02:30:18.792]  Thank you both.
[02:30:18.812 --> 02:30:24.393]  For always putting your family and the kids first.
[02:30:26.571 --> 02:30:27.672]  See, this is the thing.
[02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:34.038]  They realized authenticity is the key, so they're really working hard at faking authenticity, and that's what this is supposed to be.
[02:30:34.078 --> 02:30:39.963]  Between taking cooking instructions, they'd have to answer questions about what problem they wanted to solve in the world.
[02:30:40.364 --> 02:30:46.609]  They learned that you've always got to be prepared, because Kama is gonna prosecute the case.
[02:30:49.134 --> 02:30:57.357]  And in the same breath that Cole and Greenlee told us that they were engaged, they asked Kamala to officiate their wedding.
[02:30:59.178 --> 02:31:15.745]  And in the same way that she always steps up when it matters, Kamala put so much time into those remarks, and she bound them in a book that matched her dark red dress, and then turned that into a gift for the happy couple.
[02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:16.910]  Wow.
[02:31:17.310 --> 02:31:18.991]  For your wedding, I'm going to gift something.
[02:31:19.011 --> 02:31:26.894]  A few days ago, during this incredible time we're going through, there was a brief window when Kamala was back at home.
[02:31:26.934 --> 02:31:27.674]  Here's one of my paintings.
[02:31:27.975 --> 02:31:37.638]  And I saw her sitting on her favorite chair, and in the middle of a wild month, you just hoped that she was having the same view, yeah.
[02:31:37.678 --> 02:31:38.539]  She was on the phone.
[02:31:39.139 --> 02:31:44.844]  And of course, my mind went to all the potential crises that the Vice President could be dealing with.
[02:31:45.345 --> 02:31:46.206]  Was it domestic?
[02:31:46.666 --> 02:31:47.607]  Was it foreign?
[02:31:48.068 --> 02:31:49.149]  Was it campaign?
[02:31:49.169 --> 02:31:50.630]  Have they ever contacted her to deal with anything?
[02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:51.271]  I could see she was focused.
[02:31:51.711 --> 02:31:55.114]  And all I knew was that it must be something important.
[02:31:55.875 --> 02:31:57.056]  It turns out it was.
[02:31:58.417 --> 02:31:59.258]  Ella had called her.
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.121]  That's Kamala.
[02:32:03.686 --> 02:32:04.267]  That's Kamala.
[02:32:04.407 --> 02:32:04.987]  Oh my god.
[02:32:05.268 --> 02:32:06.909]  Kamala answers the phone.
[02:32:06.929 --> 02:32:09.192]  Those kids are her priorities.
[02:32:09.472 --> 02:32:12.915]  And that scene was a perfect map of her heart.
[02:32:13.996 --> 02:32:16.159]  She's always been there for our children.
[02:32:16.699 --> 02:32:19.262]  And I know she'll always be there for yours too.
[02:32:19.802 --> 02:32:21.304]  I don't want you there for my children.
[02:32:24.324 --> 02:32:26.746]  Kamala is a joyful warrior.
[02:32:26.886 --> 02:32:28.027]  God, joy again.
[02:32:28.147 --> 02:32:32.712]  It's doing for her country what she has always done for the people that she loves.
[02:32:33.452 --> 02:32:37.296]  Her passion will benefit all of us when she's our president.
[02:32:41.044 --> 02:32:43.406]  And here's the thing about joyful warriors.
[02:32:43.806 --> 02:32:45.908]  They're still warriors.
[02:32:46.288 --> 02:32:49.050]  And Kamala is as tough as it comes.
[02:32:49.611 --> 02:32:55.035]  Just ask the criminals, the global gangsters, and the witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:58.711]  She never runs from a fight.
[02:32:59.551 --> 02:33:03.952]  And she knows the best way to deal with a coward is to take him head on.
[02:33:04.192 --> 02:33:06.613]  Because we all know cowards are weak.
[02:33:07.173 --> 02:33:10.134]  And Kamala Harris can smell weakness.
[02:33:10.594 --> 02:33:14.195]  She doesn't smell right before she initiated a coup against the president.
[02:33:15.195 --> 02:33:17.178]  And you know that look I'm talking about.
[02:33:17.198 --> 02:33:19.561]  That look is not just a meme.
[02:33:19.621 --> 02:33:23.365]  It reflects her true belief in honest and direct leadership.
[02:33:23.866 --> 02:33:27.791]  And it's also why she will not be distracted by nonsense.
[02:33:28.732 --> 02:33:32.637]  Kamala knows that in order to win, we cannot lose focus.
[02:33:33.718 --> 02:33:39.783]  America, in this election, you have to decide who to trust with your family's future.
[02:33:40.644 --> 02:33:42.866]  I trusted Kamala with our family's future.
[02:33:42.886 --> 02:33:45.508]  It was the best decision I ever made.
[02:33:46.388 --> 02:33:49.491]  This Thursday will be our 10th wedding anniversary.
[02:33:54.602 --> 02:33:55.283]  Alright, let's do this.
[02:33:55.303 --> 02:33:55.903]  That was awful.
[02:33:55.923 --> 02:33:56.984]  That was just sad and pathetic.
[02:34:17.853 --> 02:34:20.294]  I can't take anymore so I'm leaving now.
[02:34:21.095 --> 02:34:24.818]  Of course we'll be here bright and early for American Journal tomorrow in the a.m.
[02:34:25.178 --> 02:34:27.940]  where we will discuss what the hell we all just saw.
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:29.381]  You're gonna stay here.
[02:34:29.481 --> 02:34:32.683]  Alex Jones is going to join Mr. Chase Geiser in studio.
[02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:35.285]  Thank you for joining us here.
[02:34:35.646 --> 02:34:38.929]  The celebration continues on the other side.
[02:34:38.949 --> 02:34:39.790]  I'm going to head out.
[02:34:39.930 --> 02:34:41.152]  Chase is going to switch space with me.
[02:34:41.172 --> 02:34:42.073]  Alex is going to come in.
[02:34:42.493 --> 02:34:46.477]  Please do follow me at Harrison H. Smith on X. And what are we doing?
[02:34:46.858 --> 02:34:52.804]  We're going to throw to a video of Alex's new report about the inside information he has as to the future of the RFK Jr.
[02:34:52.824 --> 02:34:55.767]  campaign and an endorsement for Donald Trump, apparently.
[02:34:56.462 --> 02:34:59.103]  Well, I've yet to see the video, so we're going to throw it to it.
[02:34:59.124 --> 02:35:00.564]  So thank you, Harrison, for being here.
[02:35:00.584 --> 02:35:02.686]  It's always an honor to share this space with you.
[02:35:02.706 --> 02:35:03.806]  Appreciate it, man.
[02:35:03.846 --> 02:35:04.607]  The honor is all mine.
[02:35:04.647 --> 02:35:05.827]  Thank you, everybody out there.
[02:35:05.867 --> 02:35:13.912]  Thank the InfoWars audience for giving us this opportunity to wax sarcastic at the utter clown show that is the Democratic Party.
[02:35:14.432 --> 02:35:17.434]  I'll be back tomorrow morning, American Journal, 8 a.m.
[02:35:17.594 --> 02:35:18.154]  Central Time.
[02:35:18.174 --> 02:35:19.755]  We'll be opening up the lines for your phone calls.
[02:35:19.775 --> 02:35:23.958]  So any comments you have about what the hell we just witnessed, save them for tomorrow morning.
[02:35:25.694 --> 02:35:27.015]  Until then, we'll see you.
[02:35:27.055 --> 02:35:28.977]  And this is a special exclusive report.
[02:35:29.137 --> 02:35:29.878]  Share this now.
[02:35:30.319 --> 02:35:32.541]  InfoWars, the only one with this information you're about to see.
[02:35:32.581 --> 02:35:35.464]  Here's Alex Jones on RFK's future in politics.
[02:35:36.024 --> 02:35:41.550]  I was able to confirm about an hour ago that RFK Jr.
[02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:49.338]  is going to be endorsing President Trump this Friday in Los Angeles.
[02:35:51.897 --> 02:35:57.602]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:35:58.383 --> 02:36:02.086]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:36:03.067 --> 02:36:12.094]  I've got major breaking exclusive news right now in the middle of the DNC on this Tuesday, August 20th, 2024 broadcast.
[02:36:13.335 --> 02:36:18.400]  It's been a huge viral story since midday when the vice president
[02:36:19.537 --> 02:36:21.818]  Pick by RFK Jr.
[02:36:21.838 --> 02:36:42.385]  Nicole Sheehan did a podcast this morning and said that they were strongly considering joining the Trump campaign so that the globalists, so that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do not get in there.
[02:36:42.405 --> 02:36:49.028]  I shot a report about it a few hours ago.
[02:36:50.430 --> 02:36:53.652]  And then I started reaching out to some of my contacts.
[02:36:53.912 --> 02:36:57.855]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I was going to air this special report, but they've been behind all night.
[02:36:57.895 --> 02:37:00.776]  They've not had the order of the speakers correct a lot.
[02:37:00.796 --> 02:37:02.678]  I already shot this report an hour ago.
[02:37:02.738 --> 02:37:04.179]  It's up on X. It's going viral.
[02:37:04.759 --> 02:37:06.780]  Yes, it's from the highest levels of the RFK Jr.
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:07.320]  campaign.
[02:37:07.881 --> 02:37:09.462]  Yes, this is 100% real.
[02:37:09.962 --> 02:37:10.242]  Okay?
[02:37:10.582 --> 02:37:13.184]  It's like 97% of what we break ends up being true.
[02:37:13.484 --> 02:37:14.185]  They may change it.
[02:37:14.205 --> 02:37:14.965]  He may change his mind.
[02:37:14.985 --> 02:37:16.526]  But other than that, it's done.
[02:37:16.566 --> 02:37:19.068]  I got this directly from very high-level sources.
[02:37:20.809 --> 02:37:21.750]  I know a lot of the details.
[02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:24.754]  I'm not going to give those out, but Friday he will be dropping out of the race endorsing Trump.
[02:37:24.774 --> 02:37:25.675]  It's a giant game changer.
[02:37:25.935 --> 02:37:27.377]  It's not like the Libertarians get 1%.
[02:37:27.757 --> 02:37:28.438]  He's between 6% and 12%.
[02:37:28.518 --> 02:37:31.982]  If you want to see the report right now, it's on Exit Rail Alex Jones.
[02:37:32.562 --> 02:37:36.086]  But I thought Big Mike was coming out later, but Big Mike has actually
[02:37:37.253 --> 02:37:38.114]  Come out right now.
[02:37:39.035 --> 02:37:42.898]  So we've got the Big Mike theme song that I was gonna air before she came out.
[02:37:42.918 --> 02:37:48.303]  So we're gonna go ahead and air the Big Mike theme song, and then we will cut to Big Mike and give analysis and coverage of that.
[02:37:48.323 --> 02:37:49.384]  Then I'll get to the RFK Jr.
[02:37:49.405 --> 02:37:52.868]  thing that is so massive, folks, because they've got between 6 and 12% or 15% some bad
[02:37:55.430 --> 02:37:58.632]  We've got to introduce her correctly even though she's already speaking.
[02:37:58.952 --> 02:37:59.952]  So here is the Big Mike theme song.
[02:38:19.898 --> 02:38:23.439]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[02:38:23.499 --> 02:38:32.662]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS An Anaconda, Burrock's favorite pet Get him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[02:38:33.363 --> 02:38:42.706]  Joan Rivers said it's true Under the dress, it's become unglued Put it back on now, Big Mike's gonna let it show
[02:38:52.534 --> 02:38:55.176]  There are the pictures from a pregnancy.
[02:38:56.297 --> 02:38:58.619]  When did he become a G?
[02:38:59.319 --> 02:39:01.621]  Giving speeches at the DNC.
[02:39:02.481 --> 02:39:04.863]  Stands up to take a pee.
[02:39:05.704 --> 02:39:08.006]  Oh me, oh my big Mike.
[02:39:08.966 --> 02:39:11.608]  Oh now, everybody knows.
[02:39:20.114 --> 02:39:38.513]  But my heart compelled me to be here because of the sense of duty that I feel to honor her memory and to remind us all not to squander the sacrifices our elders made to give us a better future.
[02:39:38.853 --> 02:39:42.036]  Total CIA communist takeover.
[02:39:42.056 --> 02:39:43.318]  100% psychological warfare.
[02:39:45.023 --> 02:39:47.064]  And they couldn't get communism through his Americanist bias.
[02:39:47.104 --> 02:39:51.767]  They made it based on race and religion for the Biden-Cogger.
[02:39:52.067 --> 02:40:00.592]  Every single day of her life, she believed that all children, all people have value.
[02:40:01.692 --> 02:40:05.355]  That anyone can succeed if given the opportunity.
[02:40:06.534 --> 02:40:10.095]  She and my father didn't aspire to be wealthy.
[02:40:10.115 --> 02:40:14.737]  In fact, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed.
[02:40:14.757 --> 02:40:19.618]  They understood that it wasn't enough for insurance for life and everyone else around us was drowning.
[02:40:19.638 --> 02:40:21.579]  So, my mother volunteered at the police station.
[02:40:32.082 --> 02:40:35.024]  You can't take on these monsters without you, but because of you, we got a fighting chance.
[02:40:35.545 --> 02:40:38.527]  The RFK endorsement is, makes it real.
[02:40:38.787 --> 02:40:40.088]  They're really gonna try to kill Trump now.
[02:40:40.188 --> 02:40:44.591]  I mean, they are screwed.
[02:40:45.492 --> 02:40:54.838]  The belief that if you do unto others, if you love thy neighbor, if you work and scrape and sacrifice, it will pay off.
[02:40:55.259 --> 02:40:58.301]  If not for you, then maybe for your children or your grandchildren.
[02:40:58.321 --> 02:40:59.782]  It's like their whole Dead Percy legal alien voting bloc.
[02:41:01.581 --> 02:41:13.624]  Remember Gallup and others have done studies upwards of 14% that's the high end of illegals polls that they're voting and that turns out to be about six, seven million people.
[02:41:14.424 --> 02:41:17.605]  Oh, they love the National Guard.
[02:41:17.625 --> 02:41:18.645]  They love prayer groups.
[02:41:18.725 --> 02:41:20.806]  They love America, the red, white, and blue.
[02:41:20.826 --> 02:41:22.826]  They use their surrogates to attack it 24-7.
[02:41:22.927 --> 02:41:28.288]  And Obama had the Justice Department running the Trayvon Martin and all of it and then 2.0 with the
[02:41:30.021 --> 02:41:33.883]  Situation with, uh, I Can't Breathe and all the rest of it.
[02:41:35.164 --> 02:41:36.184]  Yeah, George Floyd.
[02:41:37.164 --> 02:41:40.946]  Those hearings are at least $25,000.
[02:41:40.986 --> 02:41:46.549]  Oh, I love the class war where the Democrats get 95% of the big corporate donations in this campaign against Trump.
[02:41:46.789 --> 02:41:50.171]  If you look it up, Democrats are all the richest in Congress.
[02:41:50.651 --> 02:41:52.592]  Then they turn around and act like being rich is bad.
[02:41:52.632 --> 02:41:53.732]  No, it's bad if you stole it.
[02:41:54.553 --> 02:41:56.974]  All the big tech people, but a few are globalists.
[02:41:57.879 --> 02:42:00.602]  The billionaires, only a few, like six of them are Republicans.
[02:42:01.222 --> 02:42:07.347]  She'd often tell her daughter, don't sit around and complain about things, do something.
[02:42:09.069 --> 02:42:13.753]  You're doing something, wrecking all our cities, blowing up the borders, giant human trafficking.
[02:42:14.714 --> 02:42:16.596]  I'm so glad she's not the candidate, though.
[02:42:16.616 --> 02:42:18.497]  She would have been forced to be reckoned with.
[02:42:18.517 --> 02:42:21.460]  They were really trying to get her to do it, but we tore her down.
[02:42:23.722 --> 02:42:24.643]  Just the memes alone.
[02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:27.590]  And I do believe she is a man.
[02:42:44.212 --> 02:42:48.954]  But most of your big shot putters and Olympic wrestlers and weightlifters, even the women, that's how the Russians would always win.
[02:42:49.334 --> 02:42:53.076]  There's a small percentage of women that have extra chromosomes.
[02:42:53.396 --> 02:42:53.576]  Yeah.
[02:42:53.816 --> 02:42:54.116]  Okay.
[02:42:54.216 --> 02:42:55.377]  And there's... No, it's in boxing this year.
[02:42:56.177 --> 02:42:56.517]  Absolutely.
[02:42:56.557 --> 02:42:58.258]  And so there's men that have extra chromosomes.
[02:42:58.298 --> 02:43:04.560]  So even if she doesn't have a penis, she is extremely masculine, extremely male.
[02:43:05.321 --> 02:43:07.742]  And then there's all these videos that are not doctored.
[02:43:08.502 --> 02:43:13.010]  Uh, Michelle Obama coming out of Harvard, coming out of Vince, and there's a giant penis flopping around in there, okay?
[02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.110]  Yeah.
[02:43:13.391 --> 02:43:13.531]  Yeah.
[02:43:13.571 --> 02:43:14.293]  I mean, go ahead and B-roll.
[02:43:14.313 --> 02:43:18.841]  Plus the shoulder width and the head, and the fact that her ring finger's longer than her index finger, which is very rare for women.
[02:43:19.978 --> 02:43:25.520]  Or it's some weird psyop, because Obama didn't really come from Kenya.
[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:26.320]  He was really born here.
[02:43:26.681 --> 02:43:28.681]  His dad was Frank Marshall Davis, a famous communist.
[02:43:28.921 --> 02:43:30.382]  He admitted he was his quote, uncle.
[02:43:30.442 --> 02:43:32.563]  He lived with him on the summers.
[02:43:33.563 --> 02:43:34.464]  He was working for the CIA.
[02:43:34.524 --> 02:43:35.424]  He was a double agent.
[02:43:36.184 --> 02:43:44.547]  And then his mother was photographed in softcore porn, Betty Page type stuff, in the same house, the same pictures, and the same couch.
[02:43:44.627 --> 02:43:45.708]  I mean, this is a fact.
[02:43:46.508 --> 02:43:48.712]  And so she was a classic sex operative of the CIA.
[02:43:48.992 --> 02:43:51.436]  He was raised in Malaysia by a tranny.
[02:43:51.957 --> 02:43:54.240]  And there's just a lot of beta testing with his family.
[02:43:55.241 --> 02:43:56.964]  Both sides of his family were spooked up.
[02:43:57.816 --> 02:44:01.799]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:07.484]  Remember, he used to say, when I was born in Kenya, he calls her Michael and multiple things.
[02:44:07.804 --> 02:44:09.386]  They planted that on purpose.
[02:44:09.646 --> 02:44:11.928]  You look at his supposed African father, looks nothing like him.
[02:44:12.128 --> 02:44:13.889]  Look at Frank Marshall Davis, it's his dad.
[02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:16.131]  He admittedly lived with him on the damn summers.
[02:44:16.552 --> 02:44:19.174]  Said he was like a father to him in dreams of my father.
[02:44:20.955 --> 02:44:23.818]  So, I mean, this is the reality, folks, okay?
[02:44:24.278 --> 02:44:26.220]  Four as a PSYOP, they put a rubber snake
[02:44:27.205 --> 02:44:27.887]  In her pants.
[02:44:28.688 --> 02:44:29.550]  To mess with everybody.
[02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:30.692]  I mean, look, I'm a man.
[02:44:30.853 --> 02:44:32.756]  Men all know what happens when it falls out of your underwear.
[02:44:33.438 --> 02:44:33.799]  Okay?
[02:44:33.839 --> 02:44:36.224]  And Michelle's packing major artillery.
[02:44:36.244 --> 02:44:37.687]  Let's go back to Beg Mike.
[02:44:38.684 --> 02:44:39.344]  Absolutely.
[02:44:39.404 --> 02:44:42.345]  She's extremely articulate, very smart, and people that knew
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:15.595]  Her, when she was growing up in Chicago, said she hated black people, wouldn't get around them, was like really secretive.
[02:45:17.419 --> 02:45:18.401]  Put Big Mike full screen.
[02:45:18.461 --> 02:45:19.463]  I want to get a good look at him.
[02:45:20.486 --> 02:45:28.872]  By the way, if folks think I'm joking, Joan Rivers says, she wasn't joking then, she goes, she's a tranny, we already have a gay president.
[02:45:29.612 --> 02:45:37.557]  And then you had all the people saying they had sex with Obama, and then $56,000, or whatever it was, dollars in hot dogs being delivered to his birthday party, that is the code word for gay prostitutes.
[02:45:37.897 --> 02:45:39.458]  And I'll give it to Obama, there's no M.O.
[02:45:39.498 --> 02:45:40.759]  of him being a pedophile.
[02:45:41.719 --> 02:45:45.622]  But he's at least bisexual, and that's a fact.
[02:45:48.539 --> 02:46:01.792]  What we've seen from Kamala Harris, the steel of her spine, the steadiness of her upbringing, the honesty of her example, and yes, the joy of her laughter and her light.
[02:46:05.576 --> 02:46:07.038]  It couldn't be more obvious.
[02:46:11.616 --> 02:46:29.187]  One of the reasons they're using joy is obviously the Maoist influence, but they're also using the word joy because Kamala's been memed so much for the crazy cackle, and so they're trying to install in the leftist mind a sense of joy, so when they see the cackle, they see joy instead of crazy.
[02:46:29.207 --> 02:46:33.189]  They're trying to neutralize that meme for the next three months.
[02:46:33.209 --> 02:46:36.792]  We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth.
[02:46:37.774 --> 02:46:38.294]  Her truth.
[02:46:38.735 --> 02:46:41.536]  My husband and I sadly know a little something about this.
[02:46:41.616 --> 02:46:44.437]  My Michael, my husband Michael.
[02:46:44.497 --> 02:46:50.400]  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.
[02:46:52.518 --> 02:47:01.403]  See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly-educated, successful people.
[02:47:01.423 --> 02:47:02.603]  So let's stop right here.
[02:47:02.623 --> 02:47:04.824]  You know, there's a major movie coming out this summer.
[02:47:04.844 --> 02:47:08.666]  In fact, it comes out next week, called Big Mike.
[02:47:09.206 --> 02:47:13.969]  And as Big Mike's talking, here is that trailer for this high-budget film.
[02:47:18.888 --> 02:47:23.591]  The chef of a prominent figure was found dead today in what appears to be a paddle boarding accident.
[02:47:24.272 --> 02:47:26.573]  Find out who's chef it was tonight at 10.
[02:47:26.953 --> 02:47:28.114]  Welcome to Martha's Vineyard.
[02:47:29.015 --> 02:47:29.875]  Are you our new chef?
[02:47:30.516 --> 02:47:31.196]  Thank you, yeah.
[02:47:31.216 --> 02:47:31.796]  I'm John.
[02:47:32.497 --> 02:47:33.818]  Have you met Michelle yet?
[02:47:35.018 --> 02:47:35.699]  Hello?
[02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:37.720]  Someone there?
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:39.461]  No, I haven't had the pleasure.
[02:47:40.942 --> 02:47:43.104]  Just make sure you get her her steak by noon.
[02:47:49.568 --> 02:47:50.969]  I've been getting some weird vibes here.
[02:47:51.849 --> 02:47:54.631]  Feels like I'm seeing things I'm not supposed to see.
[02:47:54.651 --> 02:47:58.093]  I don't think these people are who everyone thinks they are.
[02:48:01.576 --> 02:48:03.497]  Are you enjoying the view of my Michael?
[02:48:03.857 --> 02:48:04.537]  I mean Michelle.
[02:48:04.557 --> 02:48:17.766]  I understand.
[02:48:19.025 --> 02:48:20.986]  My name is not Michelle.
[02:48:21.026 --> 02:48:29.850]  It's... Alright, we're not joking around on this next video.
[02:48:29.890 --> 02:48:30.790]  Obviously, that was a joke.
[02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:41.635]  But the fact that she has the proportions of a man and something large that looks like a rubber snake or a large penis flaccidly bouncing around in her pants on a routine basis in at least 50 videos I've seen.
[02:48:42.715 --> 02:48:46.136]  Here is Joan Rivers a few months before.
[02:48:46.517 --> 02:48:46.917]  They said in a
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:50.201]  Mr. Rivers, how are you?
[02:49:15.629 --> 02:49:18.770]  You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[02:49:18.850 --> 02:49:21.770]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[02:49:21.790 --> 02:49:22.850]  I am so excited.
[02:49:23.171 --> 02:49:25.431]  And I should do very well because I don't show it.
[02:49:25.591 --> 02:49:28.972]  And do you think that the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:33.453]  Well, we already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.
[02:49:33.773 --> 02:49:34.073]  Got it.
[02:49:35.413 --> 02:49:37.734]  You know Michelle is a tramp.
[02:49:38.634 --> 02:49:39.494]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[02:49:40.563 --> 02:49:41.783]  A transgender.
[02:49:42.023 --> 02:49:43.024]  We all know.
[02:49:43.044 --> 02:49:43.484]  Oh my gosh.
[02:49:43.504 --> 02:49:45.605]  Oh gosh.
[02:49:45.845 --> 02:49:48.025]  It's okay.
[02:49:48.105 --> 02:49:55.868]  That's why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people.
[02:49:56.188 --> 02:50:00.009]  There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walsh.
[02:50:00.029 --> 02:50:02.049]  Big-hearted people means dumb people.
[02:50:02.069 --> 02:50:02.429]  No other choice.
[02:50:02.449 --> 02:50:05.670]  You've got to say joy at the end, too, because the primacy-recency principle in psychology.
[02:50:05.710 --> 02:50:07.511]  People remember the first thing and the last thing you said.
[02:50:09.993 --> 02:50:11.694]  Before she gets off, I bet she's going to say joy at the end.
[02:50:12.975 --> 02:50:21.980]  As we embrace this renewed sense of hope, let us not forget the despair we have felt.
[02:50:23.121 --> 02:50:25.442]  Let us not forget what we are up against.
[02:50:26.523 --> 02:50:28.784]  Yes, Kamala and Tim are doing great now.
[02:50:28.804 --> 02:50:29.605]  You guys tried to kill Trump.
[02:50:29.625 --> 02:50:29.885]  We love it.
[02:50:29.925 --> 02:50:31.926]  They're packing arenas across the country.
[02:50:31.946 --> 02:50:33.247]  Folks are energized.
[02:50:33.267 --> 02:50:33.647]  We are free.
[02:50:33.727 --> 02:50:35.528]  Oh yeah, you're talking about free big music events.
[02:50:36.008 --> 02:50:36.769]  Big, big stars.
[02:50:38.038 --> 02:50:40.999]  She doesn't have that, she has like 50 people.
[02:50:41.019 --> 02:50:44.280]  Imagine spending all that money to look like a woman and not fixing your teeth.
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:46.920]  Big Mike.
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:48.661]  Big Mike.
[02:50:49.141 --> 02:50:50.401]  Big bad Mike.
[02:50:50.781 --> 02:50:52.982]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:50:53.782 --> 02:50:54.882]  Six foot six, weighed 245.
[02:50:54.942 --> 02:50:58.163]  Kind of broad at the shoulders and narrow at the hip.
[02:50:58.583 --> 02:51:00.864]  Everybody knew you didn't give Big Mike no lip.
[02:51:01.544 --> 02:51:03.024]  Big Mike.
[02:51:03.785 --> 02:51:04.785]  Big Mike.
[02:51:06.124 --> 02:51:08.245]  Nobody knew where Mike come from.
[02:51:09.265 --> 02:51:14.046]  Some had said he just drifted to town and stayed all alone.
[02:51:14.086 --> 02:51:20.648]  Some said he come from Louisiana land where a crash and blow from a big right hand sent a Republican to the promised land.
[02:51:20.708 --> 02:51:21.368]  Big John.
[02:51:21.448 --> 02:51:24.809]  I have to get the actual lyrics off my memory.
[02:51:25.229 --> 02:51:26.650]  Big mind.
[02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:28.550]  Big mind.
[02:51:29.471 --> 02:51:31.571]  Then one day at the bottom of the mind.
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:39.723]  Big bad Mike.
[02:51:39.743 --> 02:51:41.324]  This woman's crying.
[02:51:41.344 --> 02:51:47.007]  Oh, all the billionaires fund you, all the globalists, the chi-coms, death camps, cancer viruses, the vaccines.
[02:51:47.528 --> 02:51:49.929]  Oh, I love you.
[02:51:49.969 --> 02:51:50.970]  We're the good Democrats.
[02:51:51.010 --> 02:51:52.051]  We're the good people.
[02:51:52.111 --> 02:51:53.292]  We're the cat ladies.
[02:51:54.933 --> 02:51:56.053]  Big Mike.
[02:51:57.254 --> 02:51:58.235]  Big Mike.
[02:52:01.234 --> 02:52:02.256]  Nobody knew where Mike.
[02:52:02.296 --> 02:52:05.021]  The auto-transcription can't even say Count Kamala right.
[02:52:05.061 --> 02:52:07.707]  He's just drifting into town trying to stay alone.
[02:52:09.462 --> 02:52:10.803]  If he said much, he just said hi to Big John.
[02:52:10.823 --> 02:52:11.003]  Big Mike.
[02:52:11.023 --> 02:52:11.343]  Big Mike.
[02:52:11.563 --> 02:52:14.684]  At the bottom of this mine, lays a big, bad Mike.
[02:52:14.704 --> 02:52:15.804]  Nuh uh.
[02:52:32.831 --> 02:52:35.972]  It's up to all of us to be the solution that we seek.
[02:52:36.012 --> 02:52:42.594]  It's up to all of us to be the anecdote to the darkness and division.
[02:52:43.354 --> 02:52:56.718]  I don't care how you identify politically, whether you're Democrat, Republican, Independent, or none of the above, this is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right.
[02:53:04.155 --> 02:53:06.575]  How's that ding-a-ling doing?
[02:53:07.596 --> 02:53:13.518]  But for decency and humanity... Oh yeah, bortle the babies, sell their body parts.
[02:53:13.818 --> 02:53:15.359]  Giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:53:15.739 --> 02:53:17.959]  200 plus thousand in the new Senate report.
[02:53:18.159 --> 02:53:20.300]  Missing 400 plus thousand in slave labor.
[02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:26.602]  It's up to us to block the DNA testing so the smugglers can kidnap and bring in the small babies for raping.
[02:53:28.543 --> 02:53:29.584]  Run those rape gangs!
[02:53:29.644 --> 02:53:30.664]  Run those slave gangs!
[02:53:33.066 --> 02:53:35.947]  She's slick.
[02:53:35.967 --> 02:53:44.469]  She grew up in a very wealthy household.
[02:53:44.729 --> 02:53:46.950]  It was very preppy.
[02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:48.330]  That's just films, books about it.
[02:53:48.971 --> 02:53:55.792]  But she doesn't just do like fake black southern accents or Detroit accents with different weird voices she makes up.
[02:53:56.093 --> 02:53:57.473]  She at certain points throws it in.
[02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:06.212]  11 weeks to make sure every single person we know is registered and has a voting plan.
[02:54:06.252 --> 02:54:09.237]  Every person we know, including legal aliens, which they now admit they're having a vote.
[02:54:11.183 --> 02:54:11.783]  They're smart.
[02:54:11.803 --> 02:54:14.346]  They're doing the call to action that the Republicans don't do.
[02:54:14.366 --> 02:54:15.648]  The Republicans are just bitch.
[02:54:16.148 --> 02:54:18.451]  And she's actually telling people to have a voting plan.
[02:54:18.992 --> 02:54:21.355]  She's giving people a task to actually do.
[02:54:21.375 --> 02:54:24.018]  We cannot underestimate these people.
[02:54:24.038 --> 02:54:26.461]  The Republicans just sit on their laurels thinking that the boomers are fools.
[02:54:26.481 --> 02:54:29.524]  Don't underestimate the power of the boomers.
[02:54:32.026 --> 02:54:34.227]  You know what you need to do!
[02:54:34.247 --> 02:54:37.088]  I mean, background in advertising, I owned an advertising business for eight years.
[02:54:37.108 --> 02:54:37.908]  And they know what to do.
[02:54:37.928 --> 02:54:39.428]  They just, they get it.
[02:54:39.508 --> 02:54:42.529]  Fill out those ballots, 100 apiece, cram them in there.
[02:54:42.549 --> 02:54:50.572]  Your official ask, Michelle Obama is asking you, no, I'm telling y'all to do something!
[02:54:50.592 --> 02:54:52.432]  Barack Obama said, if you vote, you're a citizen.
[02:54:53.433 --> 02:54:54.313]  Doesn't matter if you're an illegal.
[02:54:57.194 --> 02:54:58.634]  I want to enjoy it before you get off stage.
[02:54:59.375 --> 02:55:00.115]  For our future.
[02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:03.251]  They're literally collapsing every city they control.
[02:55:08.495 --> 02:55:09.956]  As we just said, do something!
[02:55:10.036 --> 02:55:10.657]  Take action!
[02:55:11.513 --> 02:55:12.233]  Give him a task.
[02:55:12.273 --> 02:55:18.875]  You were talking about an ad agency and that's why I rubbed you.
[02:55:18.935 --> 02:55:28.897]  I mean, the understanding of winning the emotional argument first and then the logical argument has been the mastery of the Democratic Party, right?
[02:55:28.937 --> 02:55:31.478]  People make buying decisions the same way they make voting decisions.
[02:55:31.498 --> 02:55:34.358]  You buy something emotionally and then you rationalize it later.
[02:55:34.398 --> 02:55:40.940]  Sure, but I've never followed that approach because I've never, you know, used the targeted computer system, but I understand it just being on the air 30 years.
[02:55:41.860 --> 02:55:47.002]  They say that the message and the way it's delivered, the signal is the message.
[02:55:47.442 --> 02:55:55.386]  So if you give people a complex, sophisticated breakdown of what's really happening, sometimes they can circumvent the emotion by actually looking into the technicals of it.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:17.736]  Yeah, if you're dealing with a rational audience, but I mean, there have been study after study done by reputable non-bias, because they're apolitical studies about the nature of marketing, and they proved this with the Mac advertisements, that what PC would do 20 years ago when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, was they would advertise all the stats of their processors and their graphics cards, and they would make the argument for why the PC was a more powerful computer than the Apple computer.
[02:56:18.797 --> 02:56:18.897]  Yeah.
[02:56:18.917 --> 02:56:19.037]  Yeah.
[02:56:48.817 --> 02:56:49.897]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[02:56:49.917 --> 02:56:50.537]  We need to do both.
[02:56:50.617 --> 02:56:51.238]  I didn't do that on purpose.
[02:56:51.258 --> 02:56:52.098]  I just had some fun, but I get it.
[02:56:52.118 --> 02:56:52.878]  That's been the delivery system.
[02:56:52.898 --> 02:56:53.158]  You're right.
[02:56:53.178 --> 02:56:54.379]  And then we're having fun and the graphics are good.
[02:57:09.301 --> 02:57:12.344]  I just have never, like, sat down and, like, I understand how they manipulate.
[02:57:12.604 --> 02:57:15.426]  I just, I just, it just doesn't... You just intuitively understand.
[02:57:15.466 --> 02:57:19.009]  Well, when I watch stuff, I don't emotionally get upset.
[02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:23.113]  I intellectually first analyze it and then use emotion as power for myself.
[02:57:23.373 --> 02:57:23.553]  Yeah.
[02:57:23.953 --> 02:57:24.414]  That make sense?
[02:57:24.534 --> 02:57:25.234]  Yeah, but you're different.
[02:57:26.656 --> 02:57:26.876]  You know?
[02:57:27.296 --> 02:57:28.777]  I'm talking about the mass population.
[02:57:28.898 --> 02:57:32.521]  Like, most people just, they're NPCs, they're operating on impulse.
[02:57:33.041 --> 02:57:36.244]  They want to smoke a cigarette, they smoke, they want to have... How do you get an NPC out of the Matrix?
[02:57:37.810 --> 02:57:38.890]  Electroshock therapy.
[02:57:39.630 --> 02:57:40.250]  I don't know, man.
[02:57:40.450 --> 02:57:41.291]  That's a great question.
[02:57:42.371 --> 02:57:43.591]  Oh, there goes Big Mike.
[02:57:43.651 --> 02:57:44.131]  Let's go back.
[02:57:44.151 --> 02:57:47.732]  I don't know if anybody else... Oh, Barack Obama, the long-legged mack daddy.
[02:57:47.752 --> 02:57:49.352]  Did she throw in a joy line at the end?
[02:57:49.572 --> 02:57:50.412]  I was thinking she would.
[02:57:50.432 --> 02:57:57.893]  I mean, all hope is his thing.
[02:57:57.933 --> 02:57:59.074]  But he would be the good guy.
[02:57:59.114 --> 02:57:59.874]  He'd bring people together.
[02:58:00.214 --> 02:58:01.794]  And all his surrogates created total division.
[02:58:02.794 --> 02:58:03.814]  And that's the subconscious thing.
[02:58:03.835 --> 02:58:04.955]  And then he'd bring in the fake technical.
[02:58:05.735 --> 02:58:06.415]  But it's both ways.
[02:58:14.081 --> 02:58:27.351]  Hello, Chicago!
[02:58:27.371 --> 02:58:27.411]  Oh!
[02:58:27.431 --> 02:58:28.992]  I forget, he's a pretty famous black actor.
[02:58:29.032 --> 02:58:29.693]  He's gone public.
[02:58:30.614 --> 02:58:34.877]  He worked with Obama and it basically taught him this whole affectation for the good old boy.
[02:58:34.897 --> 02:58:37.739]  Hey, Chicago, how's it going?
[02:58:37.759 --> 02:58:38.680]  I'm Elvis Presley.
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:40.321]  Thank you very much.
[02:58:41.602 --> 02:58:42.182]  Thank you!
[02:58:42.202 --> 02:58:42.923]  Say, oh yeah!
[02:58:45.814 --> 02:58:48.516]  You're all so cool because you're here with me in my $20,000 suit.
[02:58:49.937 --> 02:58:56.101]  Yeah, I live in a giant mansion at sea level in Hawaii and in Martha's Vineyard, but I want to cut all your energy off and screw the living daylights out of you.
[02:58:56.121 --> 02:58:57.462]  You like that inflation we did for you?
[02:58:57.642 --> 02:59:02.505]  He's got a lot of Denzel portrayal of Malcolm X. Chicago!
[02:59:02.565 --> 02:59:05.027]  It's good to be home!
[02:59:05.047 --> 02:59:06.308]  We're flooding with illegal aliens.
[02:59:07.228 --> 02:59:09.009]  Shut down your schools so they can stay in them.
[02:59:09.029 --> 02:59:11.751]  It's good to be home and... You like getting screwed?
[02:59:11.931 --> 02:59:12.652]  We're gonna screw you.
[02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:15.610]  I'm feeling fired up.
[02:59:16.451 --> 02:59:17.491]  I'm feeling fired up.
[02:59:17.951 --> 02:59:19.291]  We almost got America down.
[02:59:19.311 --> 02:59:20.612]  We almost killed Trump.
[02:59:20.992 --> 02:59:21.852]  Border's wide open.
[02:59:22.252 --> 02:59:23.113]  Tax traffic is great.
[02:59:23.433 --> 02:59:25.433]  How did they get Amber Rose to speak at both conventions?
[02:59:25.473 --> 02:59:31.835]  I'm ready to go and stuff those ballot boxes.
[02:59:31.955 --> 02:59:37.877]  Even if, even if I am the only person stupid enough to speak after Michelle Obama.
[02:59:45.291 --> 02:59:58.618]  I am feeling hopeful because this convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who believe in a country where anything is possible.
[03:00:03.267 --> 03:00:05.129]  Well, at least they're getting done early, my God.
[03:00:05.149 --> 03:00:08.432]  Yeah, they argue that trickle-down economics doesn't work at all.
[03:00:24.065 --> 03:00:28.088]  And they're all the most powerful people in the world.
[03:00:28.168 --> 03:00:34.193]  The last number I saw, like 75% of the wealth in Congress, it's almost 80 now, people can look it up, is the Democrats.
[03:00:34.893 --> 03:00:39.917]  Normally it's 60-40 corporate money to Democrats, 40% to Republicans.
[03:00:40.738 --> 03:00:45.462]  It's at 95% against Trump, so they keep saying we're fighting rich dudes.
[03:00:46.411 --> 03:00:50.433]  They're the worst kleptocrat, vertical integrators, robber barons.
[03:00:50.673 --> 03:00:50.913]  Yeah.
[03:00:51.434 --> 03:00:54.855]  Well, it's because all the big money is now in federal contracts.
[03:00:54.875 --> 03:00:59.938]  Now that the federal government has expanded so much, all these Fortune 500 companies depend on federal business so they support them.
[03:00:59.958 --> 03:01:01.919]  And they use the feds to shut down their competition.
[03:01:02.079 --> 03:01:02.259]  Yes.
[03:01:02.319 --> 03:01:08.342]  I can say without question that my first big decision as your nominee should not have been on my best.
[03:01:11.738 --> 03:01:16.300]  And that was asking Joe Biden to serve by my side as Vice President.
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:19.921]  And now we took him out behind the shed politically and shot his ass.
[03:01:20.421 --> 03:01:23.602]  He's all pissed off and we had to drug him up and disappear for eight days.
[03:01:23.682 --> 03:01:25.923]  Yeah, it's like Cain saying something nice to God about Abel.
[03:01:26.183 --> 03:01:34.406]  Other than some common Irish blood, Joe and I come from different backgrounds.
[03:01:35.867 --> 03:01:36.787]  But we became brothers.
[03:01:38.513 --> 03:01:43.128]  And as we work together for a sometimes pretty tough years.
[03:01:44.824 --> 03:01:49.828]  What I came to admire most about Joe wasn't just his smarts, his experience.
[03:01:50.829 --> 03:01:55.052]  This is all to get the Democrats pissed that they removed Joe in a coup just like Bernie Sanders.
[03:01:55.772 --> 03:01:57.674]  But he was actually president, even though he stole it.
[03:01:58.454 --> 03:01:59.675]  They know that's pissing people off.
[03:01:59.695 --> 03:02:01.016]  They know it's a real sore point.
[03:02:01.096 --> 03:02:03.098]  It's pure dictatorship.
[03:02:03.258 --> 03:02:04.559]  This is a pure coup against America.
[03:02:04.699 --> 03:02:07.622]  Naomi Wolf, former top Democrat strategist, says this is a coup.
[03:02:07.642 --> 03:02:08.382]  This is totally illegal.
[03:02:08.422 --> 03:02:08.722]  It is.
[03:02:11.044 --> 03:02:14.187]  And over the last four years, those are the values
[03:02:15.814 --> 03:02:16.995]  Because he really did buy 11.
[03:02:33.393 --> 03:02:39.697]  We needed a leader with the determination to drive what would become the world's strongest recovery.
[03:02:39.717 --> 03:02:43.059]  15 million jobs, higher wages, lower health care costs.
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:46.121]  Again, they launched COVID, shut everything down to stop Trump.
[03:02:46.642 --> 03:02:50.124]  He figured it out late, tried to stop it, and then it never came back.
[03:02:50.204 --> 03:02:51.285]  And they're lying about all those numbers.
[03:02:51.325 --> 03:02:53.486]  In fact, it came out today, their job numbers were totally fake.
[03:02:53.506 --> 03:02:54.587]  We needed a leader who was steady.
[03:02:56.403 --> 03:02:59.164]  Yeah, I'm just astounded, Alex, seeing Michelle and Obama here.
[03:03:26.892 --> 03:03:36.355]  At how much more impressive as political villains and politicians this prior generation of Democrats is to what we see now.
[03:03:36.375 --> 03:03:41.517]  When you see Michelle and Barack speak evil as they are, manipulative as they are, they are professional villains.
[03:03:41.537 --> 03:03:43.317]  They are Darth Vader level villains, right?
[03:03:43.337 --> 03:03:43.617]  They're right.
[03:03:43.637 --> 03:03:44.058]  They're Lex Luthor.
[03:03:44.078 --> 03:03:49.079]  When you see Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they're like the new Disney villains of Star Wars, right?
[03:03:49.119 --> 03:03:50.980]  Like stupid, weak pussies, right?
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:53.503]  So it's just it's unbelievable to me.
[03:03:53.523 --> 03:03:54.203]  No, no, keep going.
[03:03:54.223 --> 03:03:58.428]  And I'm going to take this out and clip this and put this on X right now because you explain this start over.
[03:03:58.489 --> 03:04:08.020]  Well, I'm just I was just thinking that I mean, the total degeneration with Biden and Kamala and then the whole coterie around them are like.
[03:04:08.140 --> 03:04:16.466]  There is a principle in the 48 Laws of Power, which is a famous book by Robert Greene about political power and the history of it, called never outshine the master, right?
[03:04:16.786 --> 03:04:22.851]  You never want to outshine the person who taught you how to do your craft because that will create bitterness and political rivalries.
[03:04:22.871 --> 03:04:26.213]  And what we are witnessing right now is actually the Democrats making a tremendous mistake.
[03:04:26.493 --> 03:04:35.600]  They have brought out Michelle Obama and Barack Obama, who are supervillains but professionals of the highest level of political elite villainy.
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:43.667]  And that's why at the Councils of the New World Order, he's in, I'm told, with like 20 top globalists, he is in the meeting or on a secure video line.
[03:04:43.687 --> 03:04:43.667]  100%.
[03:04:44.187 --> 03:04:45.389]  He is in the councils.
[03:04:45.489 --> 03:04:48.571]  And so is, I'm telling you, he is a field marshal.
[03:04:48.591 --> 03:04:48.892]  That's why.
[03:04:48.912 --> 03:04:50.373]  And he actually won both his elections too.
[03:04:50.813 --> 03:04:52.114]  That's the real deal right there.
[03:04:52.154 --> 03:04:53.476]  When I see this man speak...
[03:04:54.056 --> 03:05:07.949]  It is like another level of intimidation as somebody who opposes everything that he stands for than when I see Kamala or Biden speak because it's just like a different, it's like going to a minor league baseball game versus a professional major league baseball game.
[03:05:07.989 --> 03:05:09.090]  This is what we're witnessing right now.
[03:05:09.110 --> 03:05:18.438]  But the globalists admit this trend to put totally incompetent people in so they'll get the blame and it discredits the country and demoralizes people, makes it a joke, but there is a blowback from that.
[03:05:18.698 --> 03:05:19.658]  Yeah, there's going to be blowback.
[03:05:19.698 --> 03:05:24.000]  And we're talking about the subconscious, primitive level, how to bring people out of NPC status.
[03:05:24.341 --> 03:05:36.686]  The Democrats, whether they even say it outright or not, are going to feel the disparity in competence between the past generation 10 years ago of Democratic leadership from a political standpoint, not from a righteous standpoint.
[03:05:36.886 --> 03:05:37.086]  No, I agree.
[03:05:37.106 --> 03:05:38.066]  Let's go back to him.
[03:05:38.086 --> 03:05:38.466]  He's a devil.
[03:05:38.486 --> 03:05:38.706]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:38.726 --> 03:05:40.227]  But don't underestimate the devil.
[03:05:40.247 --> 03:05:40.427]  I'm not.
[03:05:40.467 --> 03:05:41.447]  The devil has a silver tongue.
[03:05:41.467 --> 03:05:41.607]  Yes.
[03:05:41.647 --> 03:05:42.447]  It just goes on and on and on.
[03:06:09.955 --> 03:06:18.881]  The other day I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day.
[03:06:19.381 --> 03:06:20.362]  Trump is not Mexican.
[03:06:24.104 --> 03:06:27.907]  Now, from a neighbor, that's exhausting.
[03:06:30.028 --> 03:06:30.769]  From a president,
[03:06:33.146 --> 03:06:34.528]  It's just dangerous.
[03:06:34.828 --> 03:06:43.379]  The truth is, Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends.
[03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:50.247]  He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him.
[03:06:51.284 --> 03:06:53.866]  Meanwhile, the big tech companies like Google pay almost no tax.
[03:06:53.886 --> 03:06:57.208]  They've written a law where they move it through Europe and through Ireland.
[03:06:57.268 --> 03:06:59.289]  I mean, it's all just, everything he says is pure lies.
[03:06:59.309 --> 03:07:05.173]  They talk about tax cuts disproportionately helping Donald Trump when their entire income for decades has been our taxes.
[03:07:05.733 --> 03:07:09.135]  That's another angle.
[03:07:09.175 --> 03:07:11.437]  He's the bad guy for actually making money and creating buildings.
[03:07:11.937 --> 03:07:13.318]  Right, all you've ever done.
[03:07:13.338 --> 03:07:13.818]  Oh, and he's bad.
[03:07:13.838 --> 03:07:15.219]  He sells steaks and wine.
[03:07:15.659 --> 03:07:16.280]  How dare him?
[03:07:18.311 --> 03:07:18.971]  Vote.
[03:07:19.332 --> 03:07:21.853]  See, I knew it was going to come up when Kamala was speaking.
[03:07:21.994 --> 03:07:23.094]  Do not boo, vote.
[03:07:23.615 --> 03:07:24.455]  She said, do something.
[03:07:24.475 --> 03:07:27.077]  Remember, it's the same message, it's just a different brand of it.
[03:07:27.417 --> 03:07:28.398]  He doesn't seem to care.
[03:07:28.418 --> 03:07:29.619]  You know what they're doing, man.
[03:07:29.699 --> 03:07:34.122]  That's what I tell listeners, share the articles, share the videos, register people to vote, take action.
[03:07:34.142 --> 03:07:37.824]  You're not going to save the world by yourself, but together we can move mountains.
[03:07:38.324 --> 03:07:46.130]  And most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them.
[03:07:47.748 --> 03:07:54.592]  Between the real Americans, who of course support him, and the outsiders who don't.
[03:07:56.273 --> 03:08:05.719]  And he wants you to think that you'll be richer and safer if you will just give him the power to put those other people back in their place.
[03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:11.042]  It is one of the oldest tricks in politics.
[03:08:12.383 --> 03:08:15.604]  From a guy whose act has, let's face it, gotten pretty stale.
[03:08:15.705 --> 03:08:25.549]  And that's what Obama says constantly, is the left put the white people in their place, because they're trying to put you somewhere, take stuff away from them, they make it all race-based, and they claim that white people are doing it.
[03:08:25.949 --> 03:08:28.010]  We have seen that movie before.
[03:08:28.030 --> 03:08:30.111]  Look at this woman, and they're divide and conquer.
[03:08:30.151 --> 03:08:31.712]  The sequel is usually worse.
[03:08:31.732 --> 03:08:36.514]  This makes Kamala look so bad, though, because he's so much better.
[03:08:36.774 --> 03:08:38.295]  Yeah, but they're going to pull something from her.
[03:08:38.415 --> 03:08:40.256]  America's ready for a new chapter.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:44.102]  America's ready for a better story!
[03:08:44.122 --> 03:08:45.624]  We just got four years of you!
[03:08:45.644 --> 03:08:48.446]  And he uses dynamic range, too.
[03:08:48.666 --> 03:08:52.470]  He's quiet and soft when he needs to be, and he gradually escalates it.
[03:08:52.590 --> 03:08:53.791]  Let's just go to straight facts here.
[03:08:54.391 --> 03:08:56.153]  They've been in power for four years.
[03:08:56.173 --> 03:08:57.494]  He keeps talking about Trump.
[03:08:58.095 --> 03:08:59.836]  In fact, I have an example here that Trump put out.
[03:08:59.856 --> 03:09:07.163]  It's in my stack, where they said Donald Trump hundreds of times, and border, and all the other stuff just a few times.
[03:09:09.085 --> 03:09:11.826]  I just, I wish politicians won because they were right, though.
[03:09:11.846 --> 03:09:13.787]  They just, they win for different reasons, man.
[03:09:14.287 --> 03:09:22.849]  I know, but we have listeners that are cerebral, but they also have to get out there and take action on the streets.
[03:09:22.909 --> 03:09:24.790]  I'm trying to find that printout I had.
[03:09:24.810 --> 03:09:25.650]  What are you looking for?
[03:09:26.191 --> 03:09:33.433]  Oh, it's something Trump put out where he, it shows how many times they said each thing, and they said Trump hundreds of times.
[03:09:34.824 --> 03:09:35.865]  Many times more than anything else.
[03:09:35.885 --> 03:09:38.426]  It was like border three times, military three times.
[03:09:38.607 --> 03:09:39.067]  Yeah.
[03:09:39.087 --> 03:09:41.228]  It was all just Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[03:09:41.248 --> 03:09:42.429]  I'm the chaos candidate forever.
[03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:44.110]  Nikki Haley and Chuck Schumer were pushing that term.
[03:09:44.651 --> 03:09:45.191]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:09:45.251 --> 03:09:46.672]  Trump, 147 times.
[03:09:47.172 --> 03:09:48.293]  Economy, 27 times.
[03:09:48.353 --> 03:09:49.073]  Border, eight times.
[03:09:49.153 --> 03:09:49.974]  Crime, six times.
[03:09:50.334 --> 03:09:51.275]  Prices, five times.
[03:09:51.355 --> 03:09:52.276]  Inflation, three times.
[03:09:52.656 --> 03:09:54.757]  And every time they mention inflation, they blame Trump.
[03:09:55.197 --> 03:09:55.378]  Right.
[03:09:55.698 --> 03:09:57.419]  Which is, again, let's go back to Obama.
[03:09:58.976 --> 03:10:04.579]  She pushed me and my administration hard to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement.
[03:10:05.420 --> 03:10:06.981]  Didn't matter that I was a Democrat.
[03:10:07.521 --> 03:10:10.263]  Didn't matter that she had knocked on doors for my campaign.
[03:10:10.363 --> 03:10:15.466]  She was going to fight to get as much relief as possible for the families who deserved it.
[03:10:15.486 --> 03:10:20.528]  Again, if you go to RealAlexJones on X, RealAlexJones on X, follow me there.
[03:10:20.548 --> 03:10:22.229]  Follow Chase Geiser, all the rest of the crew.
[03:10:22.269 --> 03:10:24.551]  We have the exclusive on RFK Jr.
[03:10:24.571 --> 03:10:25.571]  Set to drop out Friday.
[03:10:25.591 --> 03:10:26.112]  And how big?
[03:10:26.132 --> 03:10:26.532]  That's going to be...
[03:10:27.461 --> 03:10:30.003]  Wait until the convention's over so it doesn't get washed away in the news.
[03:10:30.243 --> 03:10:31.104]  And let's fade this down.
[03:10:31.144 --> 03:10:32.325]  I've heard enough from him for a minute.
[03:10:32.345 --> 03:10:34.386]  We'll hear the same speech he always gives.
[03:10:35.127 --> 03:10:38.509]  But how big a thing is this RFK Jr.?
[03:10:38.589 --> 03:10:40.190]  And yes, it's real, okay?
[03:10:40.771 --> 03:10:42.552]  That's directly from inside, high level.
[03:10:43.133 --> 03:10:46.555]  If we're talking about the estimates of RFK having 11% support,
[03:10:48.228 --> 03:10:51.189]  And we're talking about the goal being too big to rig for Trump.
[03:10:51.229 --> 03:10:53.290]  We know there's going to be some cheating that happens, right?
[03:10:53.410 --> 03:10:54.310]  Oh yeah.
[03:10:54.330 --> 03:11:00.632]  5-10% is the estimate of what the sway can really be from Democrats, from reports that I've seen and the experts that I've heard.
[03:11:01.253 --> 03:11:09.696]  So, this 11%, assuming, let's just say hypothetically, this is a dead even race right now, 50-50 Kamala Trump, this 11%
[03:11:11.772 --> 03:11:15.953]  Could single-handedly win the election for Trump, and I was talking to Dew about this earlier, Alex.
[03:11:16.373 --> 03:11:20.734]  I said, isn't it crazy, isn't it wild that we have a political system where RFK Jr.
[03:11:21.615 --> 03:11:27.996]  doesn't have enough political power to become president himself, but he has enough political power to choose who the next president is?
[03:11:28.076 --> 03:11:28.596]  Kingmaker.
[03:11:28.957 --> 03:11:29.277]  Yes.
[03:11:29.357 --> 03:11:37.959]  And he realizes, and they've been nothing but mean to him, and taken him off the ballot, and killed, you know, it was the Democrats that did it, you know, killed his father, and this is the perfect thing to do.
[03:11:38.419 --> 03:11:42.402]  Yeah, and I've been somebody who's been very critical of RFK, very reluctant to trust him.
[03:11:42.422 --> 03:11:46.746]  I didn't like seeing that one of his campaign managers was former CIA, married into his family.
[03:11:46.766 --> 03:11:49.368]  I don't like some of the reports about the way he buried his first wife.
[03:11:49.789 --> 03:11:57.395]  I was adamantly opposed to him, but if he does this, I will be totally rethinking my entire perspective on RFK.
[03:11:57.475 --> 03:11:57.876]  I agree.
[03:11:57.896 --> 03:12:02.500]  When I was given this information by a very trusted source, and I'll just leave it at that,
[03:12:03.516 --> 03:12:09.838]  I don't think they could be lying to me, but this could have been done if he really is Machiavelli, which I don't think RFK is at that level.
[03:12:09.858 --> 03:12:10.938]  He's done too much good.
[03:12:11.858 --> 03:12:14.459]  He has had some bad people around him, but that's just the nature of the system.
[03:12:15.139 --> 03:12:29.743]  But could they have disinfo planted that to then put pressure on the Democrats to give him some type of position, though he said that was a fake news story last week that he was asking for positions from both Trump and the Harris butch?
[03:12:29.963 --> 03:12:31.724]  Yep, I had a caller call in and correct me on that.
[03:12:32.024 --> 03:12:32.704]  That's true, yeah.
[03:12:33.405 --> 03:12:34.627]  What do you mean?
[03:12:34.647 --> 03:12:39.773]  Well, I was talking about how I was reporting that RFK was trying to get an administrative position.
[03:12:40.114 --> 03:12:42.357]  And a caller called in and said, no, that's just a mockingbird thing.
[03:12:42.397 --> 03:12:42.837]  It's not true.
[03:12:42.877 --> 03:12:43.538]  He's disavowed it.
[03:12:43.558 --> 03:12:45.220]  This is an info war, man.
[03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:46.482]  Like, sometimes you get things wrong.
[03:12:46.522 --> 03:12:47.523]  So I'd say 5% chance they planted this.
[03:12:51.584 --> 03:12:55.546]  To put pressure on the Democrats to give him a position, but I don't think he wants a position with them, so I don't think that's real.
[03:12:55.786 --> 03:12:58.768]  But my Machiavellian side started wargaming that.
[03:12:58.788 --> 03:13:03.351]  But no, this comes from someone I've known a long time who is in the campaign.
[03:13:03.371 --> 03:13:04.271]  I'm going to stop right there.
[03:13:04.912 --> 03:13:06.093]  And no, it's not Dale Bigtree.
[03:13:06.113 --> 03:13:09.815]  Because you were asking me, I know he works for this campaign, he's a great guy, lives here in Austin.
[03:13:10.295 --> 03:13:12.937]  Not Dale Bigtree, nothing to do with Dale Bigtree, not where it came from.
[03:13:12.957 --> 03:13:15.198]  They're going to be running around asking who did it.
[03:13:16.894 --> 03:13:19.136]  I would add all those Secret Service sources, which we still have some.
[03:13:19.696 --> 03:13:26.962]  And Dan Bongino was coming on with guests, and during the break, he goes, before I go on, are you the one telling them all this inside stuff that's coming from me?
[03:13:26.982 --> 03:13:28.543]  And I said, you're not even in the Secret Service now.
[03:13:28.603 --> 03:13:29.924]  And he goes, are you?
[03:13:29.984 --> 03:13:39.971]  And the last time he came on, and he still thinks his car got broken into, his house over it and stuff, because it was real stuff from the Secret Service about Hillary in the black ambulance and falling down.
[03:13:40.252 --> 03:13:41.392]  Can't blame him for being paranoid.
[03:13:41.412 --> 03:13:43.834]  A month before she fell down, a month before she fell down like this.
[03:13:43.934 --> 03:13:44.555]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:44.855 --> 03:13:46.597]  Yeah, I mean, that's real stuff.
[03:13:47.098 --> 03:13:52.364]  And I was talking to other people, you know, two years ago about Biden pooping all over himself and everything.
[03:13:52.484 --> 03:13:52.644]  Yeah.
[03:13:52.865 --> 03:13:54.026]  That's not just from the Secret Service.
[03:13:54.046 --> 03:13:55.107]  That's from other people in New York.
[03:13:56.168 --> 03:13:58.091]  That's why we come in with a new pair of pants.
[03:13:59.232 --> 03:14:00.834]  And then later he comes out and says, my butt's been wiped.
[03:14:00.874 --> 03:14:01.615]  My butt's been wiped.
[03:14:01.635 --> 03:14:03.177]  I mean, this is a total maniac sometimes.
[03:14:03.217 --> 03:14:04.959]  Let's go back to Big Mike's husband.
[03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:11.654]  We can't just rely on our own military.
[03:14:11.674 --> 03:14:16.359]  We've got to have a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:31.545]  We need to build more units and clear away some of the outdated laws and regulations that made it harder to build homes for working people in this country.
[03:14:31.585 --> 03:14:32.725]  That is a priority.
[03:14:44.131 --> 03:14:53.458]  To take over rural areas and build high-rises in the middle of nowhere to import third-world populations that they control with government grants and money to take over your town.
[03:14:55.339 --> 03:15:00.282]  Everything he says sounds nice, but it is a... like a dagger with toilet paper wrapped around it.
[03:15:00.302 --> 03:15:03.264]  It just looks like some toilet paper, but you stab somebody and it goes right to the toilet paper.
[03:15:03.745 --> 03:15:05.986]  Or shooting somebody through a pillow so you don't hear the sound.
[03:15:06.807 --> 03:15:07.047]  Pillow.
[03:15:10.783 --> 03:15:16.224]  But, Kamala knows we can't stop there.
[03:15:16.264 --> 03:15:19.945]  Which is why she'll keep working to limit out-of-pocket costs.
[03:15:21.645 --> 03:15:32.568]  Kamala knows that if we want to help people get ahead, we need to put the college degree in the reach of more Americans.
[03:15:33.508 --> 03:15:38.789]  But she also knows college shouldn't be the only ticket to the middle class.
[03:15:41.078 --> 03:15:43.019]  See, none of it's about what he knows.
[03:15:43.119 --> 03:15:44.099]  It's all Kamala.
[03:15:44.259 --> 03:15:48.001]  I think that Donald Trump should challenge Barack Obama to a debate.
[03:15:48.061 --> 03:15:51.642]  If he beats Barack Obama in a debate, he's going to smash Kamala.
[03:15:51.662 --> 03:15:54.864]  Kamala won't do the debate on Fox News.
[03:15:55.304 --> 03:15:56.704]  I challenge Barack Obama.
[03:15:57.145 --> 03:16:00.526]  Will you do it?
[03:16:01.146 --> 03:16:03.767]  Trump would rise the occasion and crush him.
[03:16:03.887 --> 03:16:04.507]  Yes.
[03:16:05.468 --> 03:16:07.328]  Because it wouldn't be canned stuff with Trump.
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:14.121]  He never has to face him head-on when he's just opening for Kama like this, you know?
[03:16:14.141 --> 03:16:15.742]  He's avoiding the head-on collision.
[03:16:16.102 --> 03:16:19.643]  Well, he saw how Putin put Medvedev in for a while, but was really in charge.
[03:16:19.663 --> 03:16:24.045]  You remember he bribed, he goes, if I could sit in the basement and run things from a mile from the White House, I'd do it.
[03:16:24.225 --> 03:16:29.046]  If I could just do the job, without the hassle of wearing a suit, you know, I remember that interview.
[03:16:29.066 --> 03:16:30.447]  And watch ESPN in the basement.
[03:16:30.647 --> 03:16:30.827]  Yep.
[03:16:34.688 --> 03:16:35.368]  Yes, she can.
[03:16:35.488 --> 03:16:37.089]  If I could just do the job in my game suit.
[03:16:39.761 --> 03:16:41.322]  Look how fake those affectations are.
[03:16:41.342 --> 03:16:45.144]  He's good though.

[03:17:38.738 --> 03:17:38.838]  We're
[03:17:39.258 --> 03:17:41.879]  It's not a classical stimulant, but it cleans out the cells.
[03:17:41.899 --> 03:17:43.639]  It gives you incredible clean energy with no letdown.
[03:17:44.340 --> 03:17:46.220]  That's Next Level Foundational Energy.
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:49.021]  You will be so happy you got it if you get it.
[03:17:49.341 --> 03:17:50.442]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[03:17:50.502 --> 03:17:51.902]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:17:52.242 --> 03:17:52.562]  Get it.

[03:17:54.283 --> 03:17:55.683]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:17:55.723 --> 03:17:57.564]  Shroon Force for your mental clarity.

[03:18:01.067 --> 03:18:11.696]  All the NanoSilver products, the NanoSilver Super Blue Toothpaste, the Cobb & Chill that doesn't give you a downer but smooths you out, the Rocket Rest, the Top Brain Nootropic that is a stimulant and really awesome.
[03:18:11.996 --> 03:18:16.319]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com or infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:17.500]  I thank you for your support.
[03:18:17.801 --> 03:18:20.123]  Let's go back to the long-legged Mac Daddy himself.
[03:18:24.457 --> 03:18:28.240]  Poisoning our rivers or avoid paying taxes like everybody else has to do?
[03:18:28.281 --> 03:18:28.901]  Poisoning the shots?
[03:18:31.163 --> 03:18:33.685]  Well, we have a broader idea of freedom.
[03:18:35.247 --> 03:18:40.251]  We believe in the freedom to provide for your family if you're willing to work hard.
[03:18:41.092 --> 03:18:45.736]  The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and send your kids to school.
[03:18:45.896 --> 03:18:47.618]  And I had the list of who was on tomorrow night.
[03:18:47.658 --> 03:18:48.439]  I didn't bring it in here with me.
[03:18:48.459 --> 03:18:49.440]  Will you guys bring me another list?
[03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:49.740]  Sorry.
[03:18:51.538 --> 03:18:53.065]  What's the score tonight, Lamar?
[03:18:53.105 --> 03:18:53.969]  Walls and Bill.
[03:18:54.089 --> 03:18:54.592]  Bill Clinton.
[03:18:55.325 --> 03:18:56.805]  Walls, Bill Clinton, a bunch of other evil goblins.
[03:18:56.885 --> 03:18:58.106]  And then on Thursday night, it's Kamala.
[03:18:58.126 --> 03:18:59.006]  Sorry, Matt, I keep losing these.
[03:18:59.026 --> 03:19:04.887]  Tomorrow, Tim Walls, Nancy Pelosi, Bill Clinton, Transportation Secretary Booty Juice, as Biden calls him.
[03:19:24.477 --> 03:19:28.718]  And Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris.
[03:19:31.059 --> 03:19:34.679]  An America where we, the people, includes everyone.
[03:19:35.059 --> 03:19:36.740]  Except the white people and Christians and conservatives.
[03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:37.400]  They're the devil.
[03:19:37.420 --> 03:19:41.281]  Because that's the only way this American experiment works.
[03:19:41.321 --> 03:19:43.541]  He always is the nice guy, then the surrogates attack.
[03:19:43.901 --> 03:19:50.203]  And despite what our politics might suggest, I think most Americans understand that.
[03:19:52.793 --> 03:20:00.862]  Democracy isn't just a bunch of abstract principles and dusty laws and some book somewhere.
[03:20:01.543 --> 03:20:03.244]  It's the values we live by.
[03:20:04.346 --> 03:20:13.656]  It's the way we treat each other, including those who don't look like us, or pray like us, or see the world exactly like we do.
[03:20:21.365 --> 03:20:22.846]  I wonder what position he should have.
[03:20:22.886 --> 03:20:26.029]  Health and Human Services, NIH, talking about R.M.K.
[03:20:26.429 --> 03:20:30.272]  Jr., Attorney General, head of the FDA, EPA.
[03:20:30.292 --> 03:20:30.692]  What do you think?
[03:20:31.553 --> 03:20:33.274]  I mean, vaccines are his expertise.
[03:20:33.474 --> 03:20:37.197]  So whatever role would redo the vaccine schedule would probably be meaningful.
[03:20:37.637 --> 03:20:39.019]  Would it be Secretary of Health?
[03:20:39.399 --> 03:20:40.660]  Yeah, but that's Trump's blind spot.
[03:20:40.680 --> 03:20:41.540]  He never knows when somebody's wrong.
[03:20:42.161 --> 03:20:43.042]  Imagine Attorney General.
[03:20:43.802 --> 03:20:44.363]  He's a lawyer.
[03:20:44.823 --> 03:20:45.624]  Dad was Attorney General.
[03:20:45.644 --> 03:20:48.546]  He could actually prosecute the deep state with some personal motive.
[03:20:49.491 --> 03:20:51.531]  Maybe insurance for them not wanting to assassinate Trump.
[03:20:53.772 --> 03:20:55.692]  After a while, regular folks just tune out.
[03:20:57.232 --> 03:20:58.333]  Or they don't bother to vote.
[03:21:01.353 --> 03:21:08.335]  Now that approach may work for the politicians who just want attention and thrive on division.
[03:21:09.975 --> 03:21:15.616]  But it won't work for us to make progress on the things we care about.
[03:21:16.721 --> 03:21:19.165]  The things that really affect people's lives.
[03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:27.117]  Trump is now offering Musk a cabinet position, it's official.
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:44.292]  Former President Trump has announced his intention to offer Elon Musk a position in his administration, potentially as a cabinet member or in an advisory role, should he win the 2024 presidential election.
[03:21:44.832 --> 03:21:47.774]  Elon Musk has publicly expressed his willingness to serve in the capacity.
[03:21:48.415 --> 03:21:57.942]  The potential collaboration has sparked discussions about its implications on the political landscape, with some viewing it as a strategic move by Trump to leverage Musk's influence
[03:21:58.682 --> 03:22:00.903]  I think it's a great idea.
[03:22:00.923 --> 03:22:01.343]  What do you think?
[03:22:16.909 --> 03:22:17.349]  We're good to go.
[03:22:41.096 --> 03:22:46.557]  And here's a key point that needs to be made, as you mentioned, emotionally, and how they're using the subconscious.
[03:23:12.247 --> 03:23:16.128]  The Democrats aren't running on anything, as I mentioned earlier, but hating Trump and blaming him.
[03:23:16.588 --> 03:23:19.088]  He's not been in power for almost four years.
[03:23:19.288 --> 03:23:22.309]  We have to keep hammering that, that he's not the president.
[03:23:22.329 --> 03:23:24.549]  He really was, but they stole the election.
[03:23:25.049 --> 03:23:33.271]  So all they care about is defeating Trump because they want to stay in power, and they're simply, again, using him as the distraction for what they've done.
[03:23:33.311 --> 03:23:37.472]  So if they are able to steal it from him, God forbid, or they kill him, boy, they're really going to be in trouble now.
[03:23:37.852 --> 03:23:39.072]  They had the audacity.
[03:23:39.918 --> 03:23:46.008]  To imply that there was an attempt on Mike Pence's life when there was literally a shot by- That was Raskin!
[03:23:46.929 --> 03:23:47.230]  Yes.
[03:23:47.490 --> 03:23:50.335]  There was litera- Trump was literally shot a month ago.
[03:23:51.289 --> 03:23:53.992]  And they're talking about Mike Pence's life being a threat.
[03:23:54.292 --> 03:23:59.076]  I mean, the gaslighting there is just beyond me.
[03:23:59.136 --> 03:24:02.159]  I can't even fathom the audacity of that level.
[03:24:02.239 --> 03:24:02.739]  Absolutely.
[03:24:02.759 --> 03:24:03.640]  But they're just doubling down.
[03:24:03.680 --> 03:24:06.523]  They know they have a monopoly on the subconscious.
[03:24:06.863 --> 03:24:08.164]  And there's like, Trump is bad.
[03:24:08.204 --> 03:24:08.885]  Trump did this to you.
[03:24:08.905 --> 03:24:09.786]  Let's go back to Obama.
[03:24:13.562 --> 03:24:16.846]  People voted for Obama, but they know that no one's going to vote for Kamala.
[03:24:16.866 --> 03:24:18.267]  They're only going to vote against Trump.
[03:24:18.307 --> 03:24:20.049]  That's why they're going with the anti-Trump rally.
[03:24:20.069 --> 03:24:23.232]  Yeah, I don't like Al Gore, but Bush stole it in 2000.
[03:24:23.292 --> 03:24:24.413]  And Obama won both times.
[03:24:24.474 --> 03:24:25.515]  Bush won in 2004.
[03:24:34.566 --> 03:24:35.207]  Too big to rig.
[03:24:35.227 --> 03:24:35.467]  Gotta be.
[03:24:35.487 --> 03:24:35.867]  Yeah.
[03:24:35.927 --> 03:24:37.988]  We don't take the time to know each other.
[03:25:04.710 --> 03:25:06.210]  Conservatively, it's worth 5 points.
[03:25:06.230 --> 03:25:09.471]  Probably worth as high as, like you said, 12.
[03:25:09.811 --> 03:25:13.732]  Well, it's definitely going to get all the anti-vax votes back.
[03:25:14.153 --> 03:25:23.815]  There's a lot of conservatives reluctant to vote for Trump because of the vaccine stuff and Operation Warp Speed, which has been an issue, and that's going to just heal that wound, I think, for him if RFK comes out and endorses him.
[03:25:23.855 --> 03:25:30.177]  All across America, in big cities and small towns, away from all the noise,
[03:25:32.349 --> 03:25:34.750]  The ties that bind us together are still there.
[03:25:35.771 --> 03:25:40.353]  We still coach Little League and look out for our elderly neighbors.
[03:25:40.373 --> 03:25:41.514]  We still have drag queen story time.
[03:25:41.534 --> 03:25:46.837]  We still feed the hungry in churches and mosques and synagogues and temples.
[03:25:47.117 --> 03:25:51.980]  We share the same pride when our Olympic athletes compete for the gold.
[03:25:56.539 --> 03:26:03.101]  Because the vast majority of us do not want to live in a country that's bitter and divided.
[03:26:03.821 --> 03:26:05.802]  But that's all they do on Democrat platforms.
[03:26:05.822 --> 03:26:06.402]  They're the worst.
[03:26:07.062 --> 03:26:08.123]  We want something better.
[03:26:08.143 --> 03:26:09.343]  Republicans just wanted to fight back.
[03:26:10.103 --> 03:26:11.244]  We want to be better.
[03:26:13.144 --> 03:26:13.404]  Joy.
[03:26:14.685 --> 03:26:18.946]  And the excitement that we're seeing around this campaign tells us we're not alone.
[03:26:21.533 --> 03:26:28.297]  Yeah, notice how the Republican RNC puts a lot of different messages and each speaker kind of said what they wanted because it's not totally controlled.
[03:26:28.577 --> 03:26:30.098]  Because the Democrats are a machine.
[03:26:30.818 --> 03:26:35.982]  But even Hitler, if you read Mein Kampf, advocated for centralized control as a more efficient form of tyranny.
[03:26:36.102 --> 03:26:37.803]  Well of course, that's what Joseph Goebbels did.
[03:26:37.843 --> 03:26:41.085]  Right, which is why the Democrats kick our ass so much.
[03:26:41.565 --> 03:26:44.567]  Because they take a tyrannical approach to their campaigning.
[03:26:45.561 --> 03:26:50.063]  And a tyrannical approach to their leadership, where the Republicans take neither.
[03:26:50.083 --> 03:26:51.404]  But you can't injustify the means.
[03:26:51.424 --> 03:26:52.344]  I don't think you're saying that.
[03:26:52.784 --> 03:26:54.305]  You can't become able to beat evil.
[03:26:54.545 --> 03:26:56.606]  I understand, but... That's the Ring of Mordor.
[03:26:56.626 --> 03:27:03.590]  But you can have an aggressive, centralized campaign structure without adopting an aggressive, centralized leadership structure.
[03:27:03.610 --> 03:27:09.532]  Well, but it's easy to sit there and attack the Republicans when they used to be bluebloods and split the power back 30, 40 years ago with the Democrats.
[03:27:09.792 --> 03:27:11.453]  The Democrats were always still senior in their power.
[03:27:11.473 --> 03:27:12.874]  They're the oldest party that was corrupt.
[03:27:14.278 --> 03:27:23.524]  The Republicans are more ragtag, and they don't have the big corporate funding, and they didn't have the corporate media before Chase, or the law firms, or the think tanks, or the PR firms.
[03:27:24.004 --> 03:27:33.491]  So, it's... I'm not sure I agree with you that the slickness... It's worked so far, and it works on zombies, but it's working less and less.
[03:27:34.093 --> 03:27:34.634]  I hope you're right.
[03:27:34.654 --> 03:27:36.015]  And I think it's reasonable.
[03:27:36.195 --> 03:27:36.636]  Maybe you are.
[03:27:37.157 --> 03:27:38.358]  I don't even know that we disagree necessarily.
[03:27:38.378 --> 03:27:40.580]  Well, I think it's a mix of both, but I'm just saying.
[03:27:40.821 --> 03:27:44.225]  Honestly, it's the same as the argument between communism versus democracy.
[03:27:44.245 --> 03:27:47.208]  Even Joe Biden said this early on in his presidency when he was a little bit more coherent.
[03:27:47.228 --> 03:27:52.374]  He said that, look, Mao believes that communism is more efficient than democracy because of the centralized control.
[03:27:52.894 --> 03:27:53.355]  We're good to go.
[03:28:08.375 --> 03:28:10.076]  So which one's going to play out?
[03:28:10.356 --> 03:28:11.677]  Are we going to fall as Americans?
[03:28:11.697 --> 03:28:14.818]  Are we going to fall for this centralized tyranny, narrative control, subconscious?
[03:28:15.218 --> 03:28:22.641]  Or are we going to subscribe and willfully choose to be awake, to be conscious, not in a dream state?
[03:28:22.661 --> 03:28:26.323]  Because they can only win you over on the left if you're in the unconscious dream state.
[03:28:26.343 --> 03:28:27.504]  That's why it's an awakening.
[03:28:27.544 --> 03:28:32.246]  Because when you wake up, you don't allow whatever Cosby's doing to you to be done to you anymore, right?
[03:28:32.266 --> 03:28:34.767]  They have to drug you in order to take advantage of you.
[03:28:34.807 --> 03:28:37.248]  They have to sedate you to take advantage of you on a subconscious level.
[03:28:37.648 --> 03:28:41.811]  No, I understand, but we should do some video presentations with some graphics and explain that.
[03:28:41.831 --> 03:28:52.600]  I know most people out there understand that because, again, you have to understand the left is in their cult and so it's very hard to penetrate that because we're actually out here working and running things.
[03:28:52.680 --> 03:28:52.840]  Yeah.
[03:28:53.221 --> 03:28:54.522]  Let's hear what Obama's saying now.
[03:28:56.403 --> 03:28:57.244]  And didn't pay a lot.
[03:28:59.806 --> 03:29:04.330]  They willingly went without just to
[03:29:05.509 --> 03:29:14.518]  He's cutting off your resources, cutting off your fertilizer, saying the oceans would have flooded us 10 feet under 10 years ago, literally 10 years ago.
[03:29:15.539 --> 03:29:22.066]  I understand, but what I'm saying is he builds giant houses at one level above, one foot above sea level.
[03:29:23.052 --> 03:29:25.274]  Martha's Vineyard and in Maui.
[03:29:25.694 --> 03:29:32.760]  No bank would give you a mortgage for a property on the ocean if sea level rising was... It hasn't risen in thousands of years.
[03:29:33.481 --> 03:29:34.401]  It's all pure crap.
[03:29:34.421 --> 03:29:37.103]  So he talks about, again, rich people taking your resources.
[03:29:37.384 --> 03:29:39.686]  The whole Great Reset, New World Order, W.E.F.
[03:29:39.746 --> 03:29:43.068]  plan, whether you're in Australia or the U.S., Canada or Germany, it's the same plan.
[03:29:43.269 --> 03:29:45.110]  They're cutting off the resources.
[03:29:47.592 --> 03:29:49.674]  So they can dictate the terms of your surrender.
[03:29:52.176 --> 03:29:54.457]  They found pleasure in simple things.
[03:29:55.657 --> 03:29:56.818]  A car game with friends.
[03:29:58.299 --> 03:30:01.380]  A good meal and laughter around the kitchen table.
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:03.081]  This is austerity pitch.
[03:30:03.701 --> 03:30:04.301]  Helping others.
[03:30:04.961 --> 03:30:06.742]  Yep, he slowed down and got quiet.
[03:30:06.762 --> 03:30:13.865]  And most of all, seeing their children do things and go places that they would have never imagined for themselves.
[03:30:17.146 --> 03:30:17.667]  Alright, Chase.
[03:30:19.079 --> 03:30:22.560]  We're going to have live coverage tomorrow and live coverage on Thursday with Kamala.
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:24.041]  I don't think we even covered all the RNC.
[03:30:24.101 --> 03:30:25.481]  We did, like, the last night, right?
[03:30:26.222 --> 03:30:26.842]  I can't remember.
[03:30:27.742 --> 03:30:28.562]  We did the last night.
[03:30:28.582 --> 03:30:32.744]  I don't know why we didn't cover the RNC, but I guess this is the enemy, so we feel like we've got to watch it.
[03:30:33.664 --> 03:30:34.965]  The crew has done a superlative job.
[03:30:35.125 --> 03:30:36.225]  I'm going to let you take over.
[03:30:36.545 --> 03:30:36.745]  Okay.
[03:30:36.985 --> 03:30:38.606]  And you've done a great job today.
[03:30:39.526 --> 03:30:40.967]  You did the morning show, didn't you?
[03:30:41.167 --> 03:30:41.447]  I did.
[03:30:41.507 --> 03:30:43.408]  I'm doing war room rest the rest of the week.
[03:30:43.988 --> 03:30:44.248]  All right.
[03:30:44.288 --> 03:30:46.769]  And then Harrison went home to take care of his babies.
[03:30:48.181 --> 03:30:50.223]  Uh, and so, uh, when are you gonna get some babies?
[03:30:50.243 --> 03:30:51.024]  You got two babies.
[03:30:51.064 --> 03:30:51.664]  Yeah, I got two kids.
[03:30:51.684 --> 03:30:52.665]  I bet your kids are awesome.
[03:30:53.126 --> 03:30:53.566]  Yeah.
[03:30:53.586 --> 03:30:54.267]  Need more babies.
[03:30:54.287 --> 03:30:55.147]  Yeah, I know.
[03:30:55.287 --> 03:30:55.468]  I know.
[03:30:55.488 --> 03:30:56.869]  I tell my wife all the time she won't do it.
[03:30:57.029 --> 03:30:57.870]  Owen's got a turtle.
[03:30:58.370 --> 03:30:59.331]  Yeah, Owen's got a turtle.
[03:30:59.892 --> 03:31:00.452]  Named Donald.
[03:31:00.792 --> 03:31:01.013]  Yeah.
[03:31:01.813 --> 03:31:02.374]  I never met it.
[03:31:03.335 --> 03:31:03.975]  Really named Donald?
[03:31:04.215 --> 03:31:04.436]  Yes.
[03:31:05.677 --> 03:31:06.978]  Looks like an African tortoise, right?
[03:31:07.398 --> 03:31:07.758]  I don't know.
[03:31:08.399 --> 03:31:09.040]  African American.
[03:31:09.995 --> 03:31:11.596]  So you want to keep covering Obama here?
[03:31:11.956 --> 03:31:12.997]  Sure, let's do it until the end.
[03:31:13.377 --> 03:31:20.941]  But what I want you to do at the end is I want you to air this very important report by Ian Carroll dealing with some political assassinations that just went on.
[03:31:20.961 --> 03:31:23.902]  They just blew a boat up in Mediterranean with some top billionaires on it.
[03:31:23.922 --> 03:31:25.043]  This is a big deal.
[03:31:25.743 --> 03:31:26.944]  This is a massive deal.
[03:31:27.765 --> 03:31:29.086]  But again, RFK Jr.
[03:31:29.206 --> 03:31:30.147]  is going to be joining Trump.
[03:31:30.167 --> 03:31:31.068]  That is an exclusive.
[03:31:31.468 --> 03:31:32.770]  That is a big deal.
[03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:34.711]  That is on-exit for Alex Jones.
[03:31:35.692 --> 03:31:38.715]  And as soon as Obama's done, we will end with Ian Carroll.
[03:31:39.355 --> 03:31:41.617]  But right now, let's go back to Barack Obama.
[03:31:42.018 --> 03:31:42.959]  Great job, Chase, by the way.
[03:31:43.819 --> 03:31:44.979]  Great job the crew, I appreciate these guys.
[03:31:44.999 --> 03:32:08.525]  And I believe that's why if we each do our part over the next 77 days, if we knock on doors, if we make phone calls, if we talk to our friends, if we listen to our neighbors, if we work like we've never worked before, if we hold firm to our convictions,
[03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:21.156]  We will elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States, and Tim Walz as the next Vice President of the United States.
[03:32:22.197 --> 03:32:31.404]  We will elect leaders up and down the ballot who will fight for the hopeful, forward-looking America we all believe in.
[03:32:31.684 --> 03:32:40.871]  And together, we too will build a country that is more secure and more just, more equal, and more free.
[03:32:42.438 --> 03:32:43.319]  So let's get to work.
[03:32:43.359 --> 03:32:44.721]  God bless you.
[03:32:45.922 --> 03:32:47.444]  And God bless the United States of America.
[03:33:05.723 --> 03:33:12.507]  All right, folks, what we just witnessed was a major escalation in the energy between nights one and night two.
[03:33:12.527 --> 03:33:13.367]  And it's complicated.
[03:33:13.387 --> 03:33:16.709]  There's so many different ways to attack and analyze what we just saw happen.
[03:33:16.749 --> 03:33:26.814]  But we saw a previous generation of Democrat political professional villainy that
[03:33:28.479 --> 03:33:37.683]  Frankly, it makes Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and Joe Biden look like they're playing high school baseball compared to Major League Baseball.
[03:33:38.964 --> 03:33:53.350]  And it seems that the Kamala Harris campaign officially, as of this night, has the full force, the full weight of all the political influencers, of all the major, iconic, still breathing political pundits and leaders of the left.
[03:33:54.172 --> 03:33:54.612]  We're good to go.
[03:34:19.068 --> 03:34:24.632]  Or they have adopted, at least, the philosophy that winning the emotional argument is more important than winning the rational argument.
[03:34:25.012 --> 03:34:38.820]  And they are going to lean on that in hopes that their 30% of the population that is in an unconscious state will fall for this subconscious manipulation, this NPC behavior that we see, this non-player character that we see.
[03:34:39.841 --> 03:34:40.281]  We're good to go.
[03:35:03.050 --> 03:35:09.512]  And what we saw last night was feigned excitement and energy and optimism.
[03:35:09.652 --> 03:35:11.593]  It was obvious that it was feigned from the audience.
[03:35:11.913 --> 03:35:16.394]  What we saw tonight was genuine relief on the faces of the audience.
[03:35:16.414 --> 03:35:21.356]  When they cut to the audience, they were just like, oh, finally, somebody who we don't have to fake being proud of.
[03:35:22.236 --> 03:35:22.496]  Right?
[03:35:23.156 --> 03:35:28.059]  And so what I foresee happening over the course of the next several weeks is we're going to see a lot more Michelle Obama.
[03:35:28.279 --> 03:35:29.839]  We're going to see a lot more Barack Obama.
[03:35:29.859 --> 03:35:46.107]  We're going to see interviews on podcasts with Michelle and Barack, more so than we see from Kamala and Walsh talking about and advocating for this campaign because they understand that the more FaceTime or screen time or radio time or air time that Kamala Harris has, the more dislike she is.
[03:35:46.167 --> 03:35:48.688]  She was an inherently unpopular candidate.
[03:35:48.828 --> 03:35:51.489]  I think less than 1% of the support of the Democratic Party
[03:35:53.439 --> 03:35:57.890]  During the last cycle, so they have to rally all the support.
[03:35:58.749 --> 03:35:59.269]  We're good.
[03:36:24.312 --> 03:36:28.495]  Their entire campaign formula for victory on November 5th.
[03:36:28.715 --> 03:36:51.189]  And so the question is, is the ragtag Republican side going to win, the rebels, going to win against the calculated centralized control narrative of the leftist Maoists who want to intentionally, systematically dismantle every aspect of our civilization to catalyze desperation, to catalyze a demand
[03:36:51.829 --> 03:36:52.310]  We're good to go.
[03:37:09.173 --> 03:37:12.055]  Will Emperor Palpatine win, or will it be Luke Skywalker?
[03:37:12.095 --> 03:37:13.216]  Will we turn to the dark side?
[03:37:13.236 --> 03:37:30.468]  I mean, all that we've seen in fantasy, whether it's War of the Rings or science fiction, whether it's the traditional Star Wars movies, which are the only ones that count, is actually coming to fruition in the real right now, while the big tech technocrats attempt to create an alternative meta reality.
[03:37:31.249 --> 03:37:43.776]  We're seeing this war for your mind, this war for America, frankly, this war for the world, and this war for humanity unfold right before our eyes, which is why it's more important now than ever that you go to InfoWarsStore.com and support us.
[03:37:43.816 --> 03:37:46.257]  Not just because our products are great for your health, they are.
[03:37:46.397 --> 03:37:49.039]  Not just because our products are the best in the business, they are.
[03:37:49.099 --> 03:37:51.400]  Not just because our prices are great, they are.
[03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:54.482]  Not just because we have amazing deals every week, we do.
[03:37:55.222 --> 03:38:02.838]  But because by investing in your health and our products, you're not only fighting for yourself as an individual, your family and friends who you share these products with.
[03:38:03.899 --> 03:38:04.219]  We're good to go.
[03:38:25.851 --> 03:38:47.486]  And showing your support by getting any number of our products, whether it's life select 25 year shelf life, storable food for the apocalypse, the leftists are trying to catalyze or the Alexa pure water filters, which will allow you to clean the water you need to prepare that storable food or any of these supplements, which I have taken religiously since starting to work here last summer and seen a positive impact on my own health and the health of my family as well.
[03:38:47.506 --> 03:38:48.527]  My mother in law is a nutritionist.
[03:38:48.547 --> 03:38:49.547]  She loves the ingredients.
[03:38:49.888 --> 03:38:52.770]  She's very skeptical about supplements and she's very, very.
[03:38:53.650 --> 03:38:54.191]  Thank you, Mike.
