[00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:11.237]  I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev, and I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee.
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:21.104]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn't.
[00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:27.789]  So they said, they were walking out to the press conference, and I said, no, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.321]  They said, you have no authority.
[00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:31.241]  You're not the president.
[00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.822]  The president said, I said, call him.
[00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:36.705]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:38.646]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:39.646]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.967]  I think it was, what, six hours.
[00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:42.568]  I look, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:45.450]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.211]  Well, son of a bitch.
[00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:49.432]  You got fired.
[00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:52.454]  And they put in place someone who was solid.
[00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:54.106]  Right.
[00:00:54.146 --> 00:01:03.335]  Like, if we look at what's apparently coming out from the great Jack Maxey and his leaks about the Hunter Biden laptop, Joe Biden was vice president of the United States of America.
[00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:09.160]  There were DOD contracts and the numbers of tens of millions of dollars going to metabiota.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.903]  In the list you gave me of the reasons why you're on that board, you did not list the fact that you were the son of the Vice President.
[00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:16.844]  Of course, yeah, no.
[00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:18.144]  What role do you think that played?
[00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:46.447]  I think that it is impossible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying that I'm the son of the Vice President of the United States.
[00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:50.970]  If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?
[00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.110]  I don't know.
[00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.191]  I don't know.
[00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:53.951]  Probably not.
[00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.214]  I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.
[00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:01.555]  Do you regret being on the board to begin with?
[00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.696]  No, I don't regret being on the board.
[00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:09.219]  What I regret is not taking into account that there would be
[00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:20.275]  A Rudy Giuliani, um, and a, um, and a president of the United States that would be listening to this, this ridiculous conspiracy idea.
[00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.117]  I don't know what he was doing.
[00:02:22.157 --> 00:02:23.338]  I know he was on the board.
[00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.901]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board, and that was it.
[00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:29.424]  And there's nobody... Well, you've had a lot of time.
[00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:31.025]  Isn't this something you want to get to the bottom of?
[00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:32.627]  No, because I trust my son.
[00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:01.999]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.400]  That's not going to happen.
[00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:07.623]  Donald Trump will not become President!
[00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:13.175]  He's not going to be president.
[00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:14.356]  He is not.
[00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.298]  Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States.
[00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.439]  Take it to a bank.
[00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.559]  Okay.
[00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:19.440]  I guarantee it.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.880]  All right.
[00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.281]  All right.
[00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:22.963]  I think if he becomes the president here, make it great.
[00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.224]  The States is already great.
[00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:31.890]  I think that man will be president of the United States right about the time that spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs and red capes.
[00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.891]  I'm out though, Tom.
[00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:34.813]  Take it from me.
[00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:36.294]  How about that?
[00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:37.735]  And then of course there's Donald Trump.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.742]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a Joe.
[00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:57.347]  Donald Trump, just last week he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:58.287]  Do it.
[00:03:58.688 --> 00:03:59.168]  Do it.
[00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:01.609]  Look at me.
[00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:03.572]  Do it.
[00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:13.998]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:24.783]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address, in no part of your mind or brain can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union address?
[00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:30.326]  Well, I can imagine it being a Saturday night skit.
[00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.389]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.311]  He will never be president of the United States.
[00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.113]  And we better be ready for the fact that he might be leaving the Republican ticket next week.
[00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.435]  I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on.
[00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:46.976]  Okay, here we are.
[00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:51.318]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:54.900]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:10.837]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say, you're not going to be president, all right?
[00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:14.899]  It's been fun.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.540]  It's been great.
[00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.761]  I love you.
[00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:20.441]  Come on.
[00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:21.542]  Come on, buddy.
[00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:30.946]  All, let's say, cow poo-poo aside, there is zero chance we'll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.
[00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.373]  I'll make a prediction though for you, and I don't really get into predictions much, but this one I'll go way out on a limb.
[00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:44.215]  Donald Trump will never, ever be President of the United States.
[00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:46.796]  The Trump should not be in this race.
[00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:47.996]  He's an absurdity.
[00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:49.537]  He is a travesty.
[00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:53.219]  Donald Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:59.121]  Donald Trump is the here today, gone tomorrow candidate for President of the United States.
[00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:03.213]  Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States.
[00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:07.595]  I feel respectful of the fact that the people have not voted.
[00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.377]  He's not going to be president of the United States.
[00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:12.658]  Let's be clear.
[00:06:13.058 --> 00:06:14.599]  Donald Trump will lose the election.
[00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.422]  He had a really good chance to be different and really have a chance to change things, but he doesn't do the work.
[00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:21.982]  He's lazy.
[00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:25.337]  We talk about him every day and we are continuously bashing him.
[00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:27.039]  He's not going to be the president, don't worry about it.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.801]  Exactly!
[00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:37.831]  And we're coming to a point where if you're Hillary Clinton, you're honestly probably starting to think about not just whether you will win, but how big your win will be.
[00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:48.212]  And then you say that Donald Trump has the best day in the entire world, completely outperforms expectations, and he wins all of the toss-up states.
[00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:52.394]  He wins all five of those states, plus that Electoral College vote in Maine that he's after.
[00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:57.476]  He wins all of the toss-ups, which would be insane because nobody wins all of the toss-up states.
[00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:01.037]  Even if Donald Trump did win all of the toss-up states.
[00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:02.719]  Could I just cut through?
[00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.500]  I have one thing to say, one thing only.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.062]  And that is that this race is over.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.583]  Tomorrow morning, the money will dry up.
[00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.725]  The Republicans will start to hide.
[00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:24.487]  Trump has no place to go.
[00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:29.712]  This race, effectively as of tonight, is no longer a presidential race.
[00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:34.397]  I will get, I mean, everything I know about presidential politics, and I've been through five of them.
[00:07:35.012 --> 00:07:36.392]  I've never seen one like this.
[00:07:36.612 --> 00:07:37.493]  This race is over.
[00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:38.693]  You might as well accept it.
[00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:41.453]  And the question now is, how do you minimize damage?
[00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:51.895]  And the only way you can do that, it seems to me, is to try to grab hold of some old conservative value things and do what Mondale did in 84, which is try to save a few people down the ballot.
[00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:56.536]  But as far as Donald Trump's concerned, it will never, ever, ever happen.
[00:07:57.817 --> 00:08:02.738]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
[00:08:03.098 --> 00:08:03.958]  Exclamation point.
[00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:06.425]  At real Donald Trump.
[00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:13.630]  Well, at real Donald Trump, at least I will go down as a president.
[00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:25.057]  You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump supporters into what I call a basket of dwarves.
[00:08:25.617 --> 00:08:25.918]  Right?
[00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:39.673]  They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.
[00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:42.114]  What is the dumbest thing an American has ever said to you?
[00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:46.257]  As an American, it's my God-given right to respond to this.
[00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:48.658]  How stupid Americans can be.
[00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.559]  When I was younger, I lived in Korea.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:01.485]  And when I got back stateside, this one guy asked me, in a very thick country accent, did you live in North Korea or South Korea?
[00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:07.800]  So I live in Hawaii, and people vacation here every single day.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.103]  And I've met some of the stupidest, richest Americans in the world.
[00:09:13.363 --> 00:09:16.264]  And this is for anyone who may be taken aback by my comments.
[00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:19.265]  I want to be very clear, I don't really care if you are.
[00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:20.286]  I hope you are.
[00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:27.953]  For years now, it has been, you know, two and a half years since he officially entered the political arena.
[00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:36.195]  For years, I and others have been trying to tell you, the American people, that this man was exhibiting bigoted behavior.
[00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:44.777]  I asked him about it a number of times and he denied it, but kept up the racist rhetoric and behavior throughout the campaign and now while he's in the White House.
[00:09:45.677 --> 00:09:50.798]  His supporters made excuses, continue to make excuses for him.
[00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.952]  Some of them people I personally know.
[00:09:53.612 --> 00:10:01.762]  Some of them are his friends, as a matter of fact, and I can hear them now telling me, oh Don, Donald didn't mean that, Donald isn't a racist, or just people who don't know him.
[00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:04.205]  I don't think, I think he's taken out of context, I'm not sure.
[00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:06.008]  How many examples do you need of this?
[00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:07.690]  But he is a racist.
[00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:21.638]  And for all of you who over the last few years have uttered that tired, lazy, uninformed, uneducated, ignorant response of calling me and others who point out racist behavior racist, you know what you can go do?
[00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:27.189]  That major Facebook crackdown this morning.
[00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:36.031]  They have now kicked several high-profile people off their site, banning them, calling them, quote, a dangerous individual, saying that they violated the ban on hate and on bigotry.
[00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:40.092]  They know that although I made some outrageous statements, I've never actually done anything wrong.
[00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:42.872]  They held this story back.
[00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:43.973]  They held the footage back.
[00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:46.133]  Footage that's been out there in the wild for over a year.
[00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:48.473]  Because they don't care about victims.
[00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:49.814]  They don't care about children.
[00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:51.814]  They only care about bringing me down.
[00:10:52.603 --> 00:11:04.806]  Longtime Trump ally, former aide to President Nixon, and veteran political lobbyist Roger Stone was banned from Twitter this evening after he branded a number of CNN anchors fake news, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
[00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:06.407]  The ban is permanent.
[00:11:08.027 --> 00:11:09.007]  I was banned.
[00:11:09.027 --> 00:11:14.609]  I was threatened to sue them, and I was told it was for condoning violence.
[00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:18.188]  Uh, I put out a video of my last 20 tweets.
[00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:19.289]  There's no violence in there.
[00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:32.135]  In fact, the only thing that's political really is me disavowing, um, Unite the Right, saying I don't want anything to do with that, obviously, and also saying Howard Stern is a hypocrite for throwing Alex Jones under the bus.
[00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:38.791]  Tonight, a deafening silence from the President's Twitter account in his waning days as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:48.237]  Twitter, run by CEO Jack Dorsey, saying after close review of the President's recent tweets, it banned him due to the risk of further incitement of violence.
[00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:52.259]  You don't believe Twitter has any ability to influence elections?
[00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:57.442]  No, we are one part of a spectrum of communication channels that people have.
[00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:07.089]  So you're testifying to this committee right now that Twitter, when it silences people, when it censors people, when it blocks political speech, that has no impact on elections?
[00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.690]  Hi, I'm Fox San Antonio's Jessica Hedley.
[00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.630]  And I'm Ryan Wolf.
[00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.291]  Our greatest responsibility is to serve our Treasure Valley communities.
[00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:16.312]  The El Paso, Las Cruces communities.
[00:12:16.492 --> 00:12:17.892]  Eastern Iowa communities.
[00:12:18.012 --> 00:12:19.052]  Mid-Michigan communities.
[00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:24.054]  We are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that CBS 4 News produces.
[00:12:24.654 --> 00:12:30.536]  But we are concerned about a country that is responsible for one side of these stories plaguing our country.
[00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:31.756]  Plaguing our country.
[00:12:31.976 --> 00:12:36.577]  The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.
[00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:42.199]  More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.
[00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:47.300]  The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.561]  More alarming, some media outlets
[00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:52.522]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:15.719]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:35.486]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:38.047]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:38.627 --> 00:13:40.928]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:43.089]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.651]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:59.197]  For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.
[00:14:00.618 --> 00:14:01.518]  But they failed.
[00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:03.178]  They failed.
[00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:10.223]  And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such attack never, never happens again.
[00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:15.706]  A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol.
[00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:19.248]  American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears.
[00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:23.550]  Fire stingers being thrown at the heads of police officers.
[00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:29.474]  A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers.
[00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:31.555]  We didn't see a former president
[00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:44.672]  Who had just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television, and doing nothing.
[00:14:44.872 --> 00:14:53.820]  The former President of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.
[00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:59.385]  The January 6th defendants are being treated differently on a whole nother level.
[00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:01.875]  They have been beaten by the guards.
[00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:03.956]  They are called white supremacists.
[00:15:04.517 --> 00:15:11.140]  They are denied religious services, haircuts, shaving, the ability to trim their fingernails.
[00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:13.922]  There's more outrageous things happening there.
[00:15:13.982 --> 00:15:16.203]  They're denied time with their attorneys.
[00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:22.106]  They are denied the ability to even see their families and have their families visit there.
[00:15:22.667 --> 00:15:26.529]  They are denied bail and being held there without bail.
[00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:30.588]  Many of these people have never been charged for a crime before.
[00:15:31.188 --> 00:15:35.652]  Some of them are veterans and the treatment is unbelievable.
[00:15:36.213 --> 00:15:36.613]  You're right.
[00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:42.638]  There are tens of millions of Americans who aren't on the hard left or the hard right who feel the world has gone mad.
[00:15:43.078 --> 00:15:44.860]  So in what ways has the world gone mad?
[00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:57.931]  Well, you know, when you have the chief reporter on the beat of COVID for the New York Times talking about how questioning or pursuing the question of the lab leak is racist, the world has gone mad.
[00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:03.258]  When you're not able to say out loud and in public that there are differences between men and women,
[00:16:03.738 --> 00:16:04.918]  The world has gone mad.
[00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:15.362]  When we're not allowed to acknowledge that rioting is rioting and it is bad, and that silence is not violence but violence is violence, the world has gone mad.
[00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:21.984]  When we're not able to say that Hunter Biden's laptop is a story worth pursuing, the world has gone mad.
[00:16:22.504 --> 00:16:31.530]  When in the name of progress, young school children, as young as kindergarten, are being separated in public schools because of their race.
[00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:34.612]  And that is called progress rather than segregation.
[00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:36.113]  The world has gone mad.
[00:16:36.654 --> 00:16:40.236]  There are dozens of examples that I could share with you and with your viewers.
[00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:41.797]  And you often say, you say it aloud.
[00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:42.858]  Everyone sort of knows this.
[00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.300]  You say we're not allowed, we're not able.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:45.820]  It's the chasm between.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.302]  Who's the people stopping the conversation?
[00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:48.782]  Who are they?
[00:16:50.604 --> 00:17:02.094]  Um, people let work at networks, frankly, like the one I'm speaking on right now, who try and claim that, you know, it was racist to investigate the lab leak theory.
[00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:03.775]  It was... I mean, let's just take an example.
[00:17:03.795 --> 00:17:04.516]  But who said that at CNN?
[00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.578]  But I'm just saying, though, when you say allowed, I just think it's a provocative thing to say.
[00:17:07.618 --> 00:17:11.882]  You say, we're not allowed to talk about these things, but they're all over the Internet.
[00:17:11.902 --> 00:17:13.463]  I can Google them, I can find them everywhere.
[00:17:13.744 --> 00:17:14.985]  I've heard about every story you mentioned.
[00:17:15.005 --> 00:17:15.265]  Of course.
[00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:18.808]  So I'm just suggesting, of course people are allowed to cover whatever they want to cover.
[00:17:19.248 --> 00:17:37.234]  But you and I both know, and it would be delusional to claim otherwise, that touching your finger to an increasing number of subjects that have been deemed third rail by the mainstream institutions and increasingly by some of the tech companies will lead to reputational damage, perhaps you losing your job,
[00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:38.735]  We're good.
[00:17:51.042 --> 00:17:52.263]  Why should I die on that hill?
[00:17:52.783 --> 00:17:59.228]  Why should I take the three or four weeks that it takes to smuggle through an op-ed that doesn't suit the conventional narrative?
[00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:03.912]  I might as well commission the 5000th op-ed saying that Donald Trump is a moral monster.
[00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:09.396]  What's going on is the transformation of these sense-making institutions of American life.
[00:18:09.816 --> 00:18:19.102]  It's the news media, it's the publishing house, it's the Hollywood studios, it's our universities, and they are narrowing in a radical way what's acceptable to say and what isn't.
[00:18:19.403 --> 00:18:24.746]  And you and I both know there doesn't need to be an edict from the C-suite in order for people to feel that.
[00:18:25.207 --> 00:18:26.968]  All they need is to watch an example.
[00:18:27.008 --> 00:18:28.229]  Let me give you one example.
[00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:31.971]  Dorian Abbott is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago.
[00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:36.174]  He is absolutely brilliant and he was slated to give the Carlson Lecture at MIT.
[00:18:36.214 --> 00:18:38.656]  It's an incredibly prestigious public lecture.
[00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:41.760]  But he was cancelled from that lecture because of a Twitter mob.
[00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:43.042]  And what was his sin?
[00:18:43.502 --> 00:18:48.790]  Well, he argued that people should be hired on the basis of their merit and their individual
[00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:53.846]  You know, and their individuality, not based on their identity as a group.
[00:18:54.406 --> 00:18:55.527]  That was his thought crime.
[00:18:55.887 --> 00:19:01.412]  And for that, MIT, one of the most important research universities in the world, caved in a matter of eight days.
[00:19:01.812 --> 00:19:04.435]  Now you can say to me, oh, that's cherry picking, oh, that's a one-off.
[00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:07.277]  What are the downstream effects of an example like that?
[00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:13.022]  Every other scientist, every other academic who's watching that is saying, wait, hold on.
[00:19:13.562 --> 00:19:17.786]  If he's being cancelled for that, what does that mean for me?
[00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.691]  I might as well shut up.
[00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:24.477]  I might as well practice double-think in the freest society in the history of the world.
[00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:35.831]  That is one of the great stories of our time, and that is the story that's been uncovered largely, not because of disinformation or not because they're lying about it, simply because they're ignoring it.
[00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:37.874]  It's disinformation by omission.
[00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:41.317]  People know not to touch the stove.
[00:19:41.337 --> 00:19:45.301]  People are learning not to touch the stove and thus the narrowing of the worldview is happening.
[00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.763]  So look, this is why I'm a subscriber to Common Sense.
[00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:53.128]  I think these subjects are really, really important and we need to talk about them openly on TV and address what's happened.
[00:19:53.588 --> 00:20:00.911]  The idea that cancel culture is, you know, is happening but is minor has been a narrative out there in recent weeks.
[00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:10.374]  I'm sure you've read some of these stories saying, yeah, okay, yes, there are a few examples of people being so-called cancelled, but it is not an emergency, not a massive situation.
[00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:15.896]  You are making the argument that because of self-censorship, cancel culture is pervasive.
[00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:16.976]  Is that a fair assessment?
[00:20:18.923 --> 00:20:35.388]  Yeah, I would say it's extraordinarily pervasive and what I'm saying and what I find so interesting is that you don't need a strongman and you don't need an edict from the top in order for this to be felt in a very, very, very pervasive way.
[00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:44.973]  All you need is a few of these very potent examples, and then what you need is cowardice at the top of a lot of these organizations.
[00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:55.439]  You need people who are unwilling to say no to the small minority of ideological zealots who believe in this, who want to negotiate with it for whatever reason.
[00:20:55.459 --> 00:21:00.622]  And as we have learned from the Trump administration, institutions are just people.
[00:21:01.383 --> 00:21:02.584]  Institutions are just people.
[00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:14.913]  And so if an institution whose job it is to uphold, let's say, liberalism, broadly defined, decides not to do that anymore, why should it be a surprise then that that institution becomes illiberal?
[00:21:15.313 --> 00:21:17.335]  We've just watched what happens in that sense.
[00:21:19.056 --> 00:21:21.397]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I would say about that.
[00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:24.158]  Your point about the leadership is really vital here.
[00:21:24.498 --> 00:21:33.360]  When there is a crowd on Twitter or some other social media site complaining, you know, saying, you've offended me, you've hurt me, you've been racist, you've been sexist, you've been whatever it is.
[00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.161]  And then that Twitter mob can sound really loud and really powerful.
[00:21:37.522 --> 00:21:39.022]  It's actually still a small number of people.
[00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:44.664]  But we do see companies sometimes cave to what sounds like a huge crowd that's actually pretty small.
[00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:46.964]  And that is a story that's happened over and over again.
[00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.725]  And it sounds like you're trying to push back against that.
[00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:52.661]  I'm definitely trying to push back against that.
[00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.964]  One of my ways of pushing back against that is simply starting another party.
[00:21:57.424 --> 00:22:06.472]  I mean, meaning you can stay in the room and try and, you know, scream as loud as you as as as possible every single time it happens.
[00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:09.414]  Or you could say, you know what, I'm going to be my own boss.
[00:22:09.875 --> 00:22:12.377]  I'm not going to worry about, you know,
[00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:22.377]  Angering a tiny group of people on Twitter and then being subject to, you know, a masthead or a boss that doesn't have the spine to stand up to.
[00:22:22.817 --> 00:22:29.221]  And we won't ignore what our intelligence agency had determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[00:22:31.302 --> 00:22:33.264]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:35.305]  We're not going to ignore that either.
[00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:41.749]  My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation.
[00:22:42.734 --> 00:22:49.920]  It was nearly a year ago before her father's shooting, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter.
[00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:57.786]  She's a little tight, so I was kneeling down and talked to her, so I could look her in the eye.
[00:22:58.646 --> 00:23:02.009]  She looked at me, she said, my daddy changed the world.
[00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:10.876]  Well, after the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was, if
[00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:14.737]  If we have the courage to act for Congress.
[00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:19.741]  We've all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of black Americans.
[00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:24.065]  Now's our opportunity to make some real progress.
[00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:31.371]  The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities and we serve them honorably.
[00:23:33.153 --> 00:23:33.553]  I know them.
[00:23:34.494 --> 00:23:35.235]  I know they want
[00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:53.286]  I know we want to help meet this moment as well.
[00:23:54.707 --> 00:24:11.551]  My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.
[00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:14.592]  I know Republicans have their own ideas.
[00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:18.494]  We're engaged in a very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate.
[00:24:19.434 --> 00:24:21.454]  We need to work together to find a consensus.
[00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:26.915]  But let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death.
[00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:43.199]  Yesterday, in my view, one of the darkest days in the history of our nation.
[00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.751]  An unprecedented assault on our democracy.
[00:24:48.972 --> 00:24:56.414]  An assault literally on the Citadel of Liberty and the United States Capitol itself.
[00:24:57.595 --> 00:24:59.756]  An assault on the rule of law.
[00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:04.918]  An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings.
[00:25:05.818 --> 00:25:11.120]  Gratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government.
[00:25:13.243 --> 00:25:15.764]  All of us here grieve the loss of life.
[00:25:17.064 --> 00:25:19.985]  Grieve the desecration of the people's house.
[00:25:21.466 --> 00:25:25.167]  What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent.
[00:25:26.208 --> 00:25:27.388]  It was not disorder.
[00:25:28.368 --> 00:25:29.489]  It was not protest.
[00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:31.329]  It was chaos.
[00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.130]  They weren't protesters.
[00:25:35.111 --> 00:25:37.051]  Don't dare call them protesters.
[00:25:37.352 --> 00:25:39.572]  They were a riotous mob.
[00:25:40.353 --> 00:25:41.253]  Insurrectionists.
[00:25:42.188 --> 00:25:43.349]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.571]  It's that basic.
[00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.491]  It's that simple.
[00:25:47.852 --> 00:25:51.995]  And I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming.
[00:25:53.636 --> 00:25:54.597]  But that isn't true.
[00:25:55.798 --> 00:25:57.639]  We could see it coming.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:11.009]  The past four years, we've had a president who's made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, the rule of law clear in everything he has done.
[00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:18.291]  He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset.
[00:26:18.832 --> 00:26:22.312]  And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack.
[00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:29.954]  The Biden administration will release its latest plan meant to identify and curb the increasing threat of domestic terrorism.
[00:26:30.534 --> 00:26:41.517]  In the wake of the January 6th insurrection, Attorney General Merrick Garland will outline steps government officials and social media companies alike can take to fight white supremacy and prevent people from joining dangerous groups.
[00:26:42.057 --> 00:26:46.879]  Jeff Pegues is here now with a preview of this plan and the Attorney General's address.
[00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:47.919]  Jeff, good to see you.
[00:26:47.979 --> 00:26:53.321]  So the AG has put a focus on fighting domestic terrorism since he took the job.
[00:26:54.002 --> 00:26:57.723]  We know the FBI Director Christopher Wray has talked a lot about this.
[00:26:57.763 --> 00:27:01.765]  He's testified about white supremacy in the United States.
[00:27:01.825 --> 00:27:04.786]  So let's talk about the policy that the AG plans to lay out today.
[00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:05.306]  What are you hearing?
[00:27:05.866 --> 00:27:19.510]  Well, there is a lot of pressure on this administration to do something that other recent administrations really haven't done, which is put this hyper-focus on domestic terrorism cases.
[00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.491]  As you know, there's been this focus on international terrorism.
[00:27:23.511 --> 00:27:29.179]  All the while, you have this growing threat from domestic terrorist organizations here at home.
[00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:35.808]  And so what the Attorney General will seek to do is, essentially, this is a reset.
[00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:40.374]  Not in foreign policy terms, but in domestic policy terms.
[00:27:41.154 --> 00:27:49.218]  I think what's important to note here is what the board is doing, which is continuing what is important disinformation related work.
[00:28:03.525 --> 00:28:05.546]  That began under the former administration.
[00:28:05.606 --> 00:28:18.574]  The fact sheet that they put out, what they noted yesterday, what they noted in there is that this is meant to, one, the first bullet was about protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, and the First Amendment.
[00:28:18.834 --> 00:28:29.481]  They said the primary mission is to establish best practices to ensure that efforts to understand and respond to disinformation are done in ways that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
[00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:49.134]  I'd also note that the first example they gave about what they're going to do is support the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing work, back to the former administration, to address how and understand how misinformation spread by human smugglers that prey on vulnerable populations attempting to migrate to the United States.
[00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:58.221]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush,
[00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:06.002]  President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[00:29:11.723 --> 00:29:25.366]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[00:29:27.535 --> 00:29:35.498]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[00:29:36.939 --> 00:29:38.440]  We will face challenges.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.801]  We will confront hardships.
[00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:43.482]  But we will get the job done.
[00:29:44.923 --> 00:29:51.165]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:55.187]  And we are grateful to President Obama
[00:29:56.073 --> 00:30:02.978]  And First Lady Michelle Obama, for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[00:30:03.678 --> 00:30:05.960]  They have been magnificent.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.826]  Thank you.
[00:30:14.226 --> 00:30:18.469]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:25.554]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[00:30:26.229 --> 00:30:27.710]  Or from one party to another.
[00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:32.614]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C.
[00:30:33.175 --> 00:30:36.337]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:55.053]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[00:30:57.444 --> 00:31:03.211]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[00:31:04.132 --> 00:31:10.258]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[00:31:12.321 --> 00:31:17.787]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[00:31:19.131 --> 00:31:22.112]  Their victories have not been your victories.
[00:31:22.813 --> 00:31:25.674]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[00:31:26.254 --> 00:31:37.378]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[00:31:43.161 --> 00:31:48.483]  That all changes starting right here and right now.
[00:31:49.306 --> 00:31:51.707]  Because this moment is your moment.
[00:31:51.847 --> 00:31:53.688]  It belongs to you.
[00:32:01.032 --> 00:32:07.395]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
[00:32:07.795 --> 00:32:08.876]  This is your day.
[00:32:09.656 --> 00:32:11.057]  This is your celebration.
[00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:16.199]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[00:32:24.426 --> 00:32:33.232]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[00:32:37.735 --> 00:32:48.762]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[00:32:54.893 --> 00:33:00.337]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:06.762]  Everyone is listening to you now.
[00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:17.690]  You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[00:33:22.514 --> 00:33:24.135]  At the center of this movement
[00:33:24.918 --> 00:33:31.542]  It is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:40.669]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:51.936]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
[00:33:52.862 --> 00:33:56.624]  But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
[00:33:57.564 --> 00:34:01.426]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:08.470]  Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
[00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:18.835]  An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:31.613]  And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[00:34:32.873 --> 00:34:40.095]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[00:34:49.286 --> 00:34:53.109]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.
[00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:59.614]  Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[00:35:00.655 --> 00:35:06.760]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:14.006]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[00:35:20.009 --> 00:35:34.561]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[00:35:35.762 --> 00:35:41.226]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:48.392]  And spent
[00:35:49.292 --> 00:35:58.599]  Trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:11.088]  We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:17.112]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores.
[00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:25.927]  With not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[00:36:27.248 --> 00:36:36.916]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:39.958]  But that is the past.
[00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:44.982]  And now we are looking only to the future.
[00:36:54.686 --> 00:37:05.151]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
[00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:11.694]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:19.262]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.
[00:37:20.003 --> 00:37:21.863]  America first.
[00:37:27.904 --> 00:37:40.027]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[00:37:40.732 --> 00:37:51.400]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[00:37:58.765 --> 00:38:02.207]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[00:38:03.528 --> 00:38:07.431]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body,
[00:38:08.217 --> 00:38:11.619]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:19.442]  America will start winning again.
[00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:22.384]  Winning like never before.
[00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:28.446]  We will bring back our jobs.
[00:38:29.387 --> 00:38:31.448]  We will bring back our borders.
[00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:34.149]  We will bring back our wealth.
[00:38:34.961 --> 00:38:38.084]  And we will bring back our dreams.
[00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:54.940]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[00:38:56.647 --> 00:39:06.373]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:13.657]  We will follow two simple rules.
[00:39:14.478 --> 00:39:17.700]  Buy American and hire American.
[00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:26.225]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world.
[00:39:26.835 --> 00:39:34.700]  But we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:43.585]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.
[00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:47.727]  We will shine for everyone to follow.
[00:39:52.105 --> 00:40:05.787]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[00:40:12.498 --> 00:40:18.142]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America.
[00:40:18.702 --> 00:40:25.747]  And through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[00:40:27.288 --> 00:40:33.353]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:40:41.613 --> 00:40:49.598]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[00:40:50.598 --> 00:40:58.923]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:05.807]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:13.580]  There should be no fear.
[00:41:14.461 --> 00:41:15.461]  We are protected.
[00:41:16.062 --> 00:41:18.323]  And we will always be protected.
[00:41:18.924 --> 00:41:24.328]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[00:41:25.288 --> 00:41:31.993]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:41:39.432 --> 00:41:43.755]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[00:41:44.555 --> 00:41:51.379]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:42:01.906]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
[00:42:10.746 --> 00:42:13.528]  The time for empty talk is over.
[00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:17.411]  Now arrives the hour of action.
[00:42:22.996 --> 00:42:27.900]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.504]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:35.366]  We will not fail.
[00:42:36.147 --> 00:42:38.969]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[00:42:41.082 --> 00:42:57.390]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[00:42:58.271 --> 00:43:05.114]  A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[00:43:05.915 --> 00:43:10.497]  It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget.
[00:43:11.249 --> 00:43:20.276]  That whether we are black, or brown, or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:34.706]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[00:43:40.046 --> 00:44:00.534]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
[00:44:07.387 --> 00:44:17.490]  So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words.
[00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.331]  You will never be ignored again.
[00:44:26.593 --> 00:44:34.015]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.
[00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.917]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:44.863]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[00:44:45.643 --> 00:44:48.305]  We will make America wealthy again.
[00:44:48.805 --> 00:44:51.387]  We will make America proud again.
[00:44:51.987 --> 00:44:54.589]  We will make America safe again.
[00:44:55.049 --> 00:45:00.733]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:05.156]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:45:07.318 --> 00:45:07.698]  Thank you.
[00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:13.162]  All right, folks.
[00:45:14.143 --> 00:45:19.287]  We are tuning in right now, broadcasting live from the InfoWars headquarters based in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:20.709 --> 00:45:23.591]  A Democrat hellhole in the midst of a Republican state.
[00:45:24.632 --> 00:45:29.057]  A state which perhaps should be a republic itself again one day in May.
[00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:36.259]  Just may manifest that reality in the event that we do have these Maoists to win this election.
[00:45:36.919 --> 00:45:43.425]  Now, this DNC convention has been happening now for, oh, about an hour or so, just a little bit longer even.
[00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:53.494]  And they've got a slew, a slate of miscellaneous speakers, miscellaneous masters of ceremony on stage as they present
[00:45:54.693 --> 00:46:05.921]  Cripple cases and other cases of just minorities and vulnerable communities among us who lean on democratic policies in order to win the hearts and minds of the people at the expense of all reason.
[00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:13.265]  Which has been the traditional platform of the Democratic Party psychological operations against.
[00:46:14.446 --> 00:46:19.349]  The American people to convince them that these policies which actually cripple our nation itself.
[00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:24.373]  Are designed to serve the benefit of the American people.
[00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:38.655]  So they've decided to launch this DNC, this Democratic National Convention, or this DNCCP as I like to call it, in Chicago, Illinois, which is notoriously among the most corrupt cities in the Union.
[00:46:39.636 --> 00:46:43.801]  Growing up in Illinois, everyone in Central Illinois, Southern Illinois,
[00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:45.919]  We're good to go.
[00:47:06.977 --> 00:47:13.640]  The political leaders of Chicago have been associated as full of hot air, full of BS, all talk, no action.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:20.803]  This is exactly what we're seeing from this decrepit party right before our eyes as this DNC is broadcast to the masses.
[00:47:20.823 --> 00:47:30.167]  And I am just praying to God that the reality of the corruption of this Democratic Party
[00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:54.762]  Is revealed to the American people in a way that they accept and understand and realize because right now it feels like as a nation, we have a group of people who are awakened to the corruption of the left and we have a group of people, hundreds of millions perhaps, certainly tens of millions, who refuse to wake up no matter how much light is shined directly into their eyes.
[00:47:56.443 --> 00:47:58.744]  But outside of this very convention,
[00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:11.446]  We see that there is just a litany of examples of how the DNC is hypocritical by having up its walls and fences, but refusing to have them at the border.
[00:48:11.707 --> 00:48:14.350]  How the DNC is constantly dropping the ball
[00:48:15.635 --> 00:48:20.579]  In terms of what these leftist Antifa pro Palestine groups are doing outside of this convention.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.963]  Jumping over barricades, tearing down barricades, and I want to go to clip number five here.
[00:48:25.003 --> 00:48:32.109]  If the crew is ready, this is Benny Johnson checking out all of the fences around the DNC to point out the hypocrisy of the left.
[00:48:32.149 --> 00:48:33.130]  Are we able to run these clips?
[00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:34.951]  Are you guys ready for that back on your side?
[00:48:34.971 --> 00:48:36.853]  Or were you relying on me for some more time?
[00:48:36.873 --> 00:48:42.798]  But if we have clip number five ready, please say something in my ear because I do want to show the audience what Benny Johnson uncovered.
[00:48:42.838 --> 00:48:43.938]  I also want to show clips of.
[00:48:44.699 --> 00:48:47.000]  Chicago preparing for possible surge in migrants.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.421]  During DNC, the aerial shot of pro-Palestine protests flooding Chicago.
[00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:55.562]  Some clips of Savannah Hernandez doing outstanding reporting on the ground as well.
[00:48:55.582 --> 00:49:00.524]  Let's go ahead and run straight to clip number five, just so you can see the hypocrisy of the left at this convention as it unfolds.
[00:49:02.224 --> 00:49:03.185]  Let me in!
[00:49:03.705 --> 00:49:05.465]  Let me in!
[00:49:05.886 --> 00:49:06.646]  Let me in!
[00:49:07.206 --> 00:49:08.526]  Let me in!
[00:49:08.646 --> 00:49:09.607]  What's with all these walls?
[00:49:10.587 --> 00:49:11.087]  Security.
[00:49:11.287 --> 00:49:11.527]  Yeah.
[00:49:11.987 --> 00:49:12.268]  Yeah.
[00:49:12.888 --> 00:49:13.708]  So do walls work?
[00:49:14.594 --> 00:49:15.134]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:16.255 --> 00:49:16.615]  Will they help?
[00:49:17.995 --> 00:49:19.496]  So would you be in favor of a border wall?
[00:49:20.677 --> 00:49:21.057]  Not really.
[00:49:21.077 --> 00:49:24.358]  I said, hold up.
[00:49:24.838 --> 00:49:25.499]  Wait a minute.
[00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:26.759]  Something ain't right.
[00:49:26.939 --> 00:49:27.339]  What's up guys?
[00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:30.181]  Your boy Benny here at the DNC in Chicago.
[00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:37.844]  You may remember for the last seven years of American history, all walls are racist and evil.
[00:49:38.064 --> 00:49:38.744]  Remember it.
[00:49:38.924 --> 00:49:39.405]  Say it.
[00:49:39.485 --> 00:49:40.025]  Repeat it.
[00:49:40.505 --> 00:49:43.826]  Yet, you will find a shocking thing that we have discovered here at the DNC.
[00:49:44.086 --> 00:49:50.168]  Right behind us, you can see the DNC logo, yet in front of the DNC is a massive wall.
[00:49:50.608 --> 00:49:54.609]  Warning signs, armed officers, armed to the teeth.
[00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:56.870]  Massive barricades.
[00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.091]  What's going on here?
[00:49:58.231 --> 00:49:59.891]  I can't believe this change in policy.
[00:50:00.151 --> 00:50:02.412]  Is Kamala Harris going to agree to a wall on the southern border?
[00:50:02.612 --> 00:50:03.092]  We don't know.
[00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:05.673]  Is this the new actions of the borders are?
[00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:08.751]  We don't know, but that's one hell of a wall.
[00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:11.112]  We're going to investigate today at the DNC.
[00:50:11.192 --> 00:50:11.833]  It's your boy, Benny.
[00:50:11.853 --> 00:50:12.153]  Let's go.
[00:50:12.493 --> 00:50:14.474]  Look at the size of this thing.
[00:50:14.854 --> 00:50:15.335]  Look at this!
[00:50:16.015 --> 00:50:16.255]  Look!
[00:50:17.276 --> 00:50:17.676]  I'm six.
[00:50:18.096 --> 00:50:18.997]  I'm six foot tall.
[00:50:19.337 --> 00:50:20.318]  On a good day, I'm 6'1".
[00:50:20.978 --> 00:50:21.378]  Look at this.
[00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:23.880]  Look at that.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.200]  Look!
[00:50:25.581 --> 00:50:29.183]  That's got to be seven, eight feet tall.
[00:50:29.543 --> 00:50:30.604]  What have I told you?
[00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:31.804]  This is Trump streaming.
[00:50:31.824 --> 00:50:32.325]  Look right there.
[00:50:32.365 --> 00:50:33.805]  The Sears Tower, just plain as day.
[00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:34.706]  You can see it right there.
[00:50:34.726 --> 00:50:35.887]  We're in downtown Chicago.
[00:50:35.987 --> 00:50:36.387]  Look at that.
[00:50:37.586 --> 00:50:38.787]  Little electronic devices.
[00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:40.148]  They're definitely watching us right now.
[00:50:40.168 --> 00:50:41.489]  You can see the little bubble right there.
[00:50:41.509 --> 00:50:47.694]  So you'll see here, ladies and gentlemen, that you are not allowed to fly drones.
[00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:55.179]  You are able to fly drones over Donald Trump's rallies if you are a would-be assassin, but not here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.080]  No drone zone.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.902]  Do not enter authorized zone only.
[00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:00.884]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:04.032]  Chicago's finest.
[00:51:04.393 --> 00:51:10.040]  Baby, not only do they got giant black walls around here, they got these giant cement barricades.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:10.881]  Look at this!
[00:51:11.042 --> 00:51:12.784]  God, it's so huge!
[00:51:12.964 --> 00:51:13.685]  Couldn't do anything.
[00:51:14.126 --> 00:51:15.628]  Can't do nothing, alright?
[00:51:15.968 --> 00:51:18.332]  Got this giant mechanical gate, right?
[00:51:18.832 --> 00:51:22.353]  You destroy any vehicle, anything that you drive into it.
[00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:26.194]  Just a massive fortress here in front of the DNC.
[00:51:26.714 --> 00:51:32.995]  This area has been shut down for blocks in every direction to protect our border czar.
[00:51:33.336 --> 00:51:35.056]  You can see that there's no traffic.
[00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:45.298]  I'm standing right here in the middle of the street and in front of me is a massive wall that stretches for miles around the DNC.
[00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:47.359]  So you can't have it both ways.
[00:51:48.425 --> 00:51:52.548]  Either Walz are racist, or Walz work.
[00:51:54.229 --> 00:51:59.873]  It seems, when given the opportunity, Democrats are choosing racist Walz.
[00:52:02.675 --> 00:52:05.176]  I mean, maybe that's why they chose a vice president named Tim Walz.
[00:52:05.957 --> 00:52:06.317]  I don't know.
[00:52:06.898 --> 00:52:08.939]  What you might be missing also is all the electronics.
[00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:11.441]  There's electronic security cameras on every single corner.
[00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:13.202]  Okay?
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.142]  This is the wall of Trump's dream.
[00:52:17.462 --> 00:52:21.706]  Trump puts on his nightcap at Mar-a-Lago and dreams about this wall.
[00:52:22.066 --> 00:52:22.406]  All right?
[00:52:22.526 --> 00:52:23.247]  He dreams about it.
[00:52:24.227 --> 00:52:25.168]  Let me in!
[00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.470]  Let me in!
[00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.611]  Let me in!
[00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:29.712]  Let me in!
[00:52:30.672 --> 00:52:32.013]  This is such a great wall.
[00:52:32.053 --> 00:52:33.114]  I'm so proud of them.
[00:52:34.095 --> 00:52:34.275]  I'm—DNC.
[00:52:36.355 --> 00:52:38.478]  Honestly, they should call it the Great Wall of China.
[00:52:38.838 --> 00:52:43.824]  Because the whole DNC is really the DNCCP, as we know with Tim Walz's history of Maoism.
[00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:46.787]  It's the Great Wall of China outside the DNC right now in Chicago.
[00:52:55.376 --> 00:52:57.498]  I don't care what kind of strongman competition you won.
[00:52:58.058 --> 00:52:59.119]  You ain't moving that block.
[00:52:59.359 --> 00:52:59.779]  No way.
[00:52:59.979 --> 00:53:00.500]  Look at that.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.380]  Immovable.
[00:53:02.141 --> 00:53:06.724]  If you were trying to cross the southern border and you ran into something like this, you're turning around.
[00:53:06.984 --> 00:53:11.287]  Now we know why Kamala Harris picked Tim Walls.
[00:53:11.827 --> 00:53:13.669]  Because she loves walls.
[00:53:14.169 --> 00:53:15.130]  She's our border czar.
[00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.932]  She can't wait to be protected by a wall.
[00:53:18.212 --> 00:53:22.695]  Kamala Harris is protected by a wall and guys with guns and security every single day of her life.
[00:53:23.195 --> 00:53:25.777]  Everywhere Kamala goes, she's protected by a giant wall.
[00:53:26.238 --> 00:53:29.040]  And security, and drones, and video, and who knows what else.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.802]  It's just she refuses to do that on our southern border.
[00:53:31.822 --> 00:53:32.782]  Maybe ask yourself why.
[00:53:33.123 --> 00:53:36.425]  Why does Kamala Harris use a wall here to protect themselves?
[00:53:36.445 --> 00:53:43.931]  You can see in this shot alone, with the walls logo, you can see there's a photo of Tim Walz.
[00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:48.094]  You can see like five, six, maybe seven walls in this just one shot.
[00:53:48.766 --> 00:53:49.066]  Wow!
[00:53:49.466 --> 00:53:50.747]  So there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:51.368 --> 00:53:51.948]  Walls work!
[00:53:52.408 --> 00:54:02.014]  Well there you have it, and I want to show you guys some footage as well of the DNC in Chicago preparing for the possible surge in migrants during the DNC.
[00:54:02.034 --> 00:54:04.815]  Of course, just as is typical for
[00:54:05.982 --> 00:54:07.803]  Democratic protests or events.
[00:54:08.283 --> 00:54:17.529]  They always have to bust in and import as many protesters or supporters as possible because there's never any any natural local support or rallying for any of their events.
[00:54:18.169 --> 00:54:23.112]  They have to have celebrities before speakers, especially political candidates, because otherwise people wouldn't show up.
[00:54:23.372 --> 00:54:25.033]  We've shown you clips this week of.
[00:54:26.053 --> 00:54:33.298]  People filing out lining up to leave as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris hold events in different gymnasiums throughout the country so.
[00:54:34.352 --> 00:54:37.855]  What we see here is Chicago preparing for the possible surge in migrants during DNC.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:38.836]  This is clip number six.
[00:54:38.856 --> 00:54:40.597]  Let's go ahead and run this and unpack it on the other side.
[00:54:42.859 --> 00:54:46.462]  Migrant advocates are getting ready for a potential increase in asylum seekers.
[00:54:46.482 --> 00:54:55.570]  There's been a drop in the number of bus drop-offs in Chicago area, but Republican governors have said they will send a lot of people to sanctuary cities during the DNC.
[00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.052]  Casey Cronus picks up our team coverage.
[00:54:58.152 --> 00:54:58.412]  Casey?
[00:55:00.635 --> 00:55:11.125]  Terrence, unless it is communicated by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, only time will tell exactly how many migrants will be dropped off here during next week's convention.
[00:55:11.485 --> 00:55:15.168]  But city officials say they are prepared to welcome thousands.
[00:55:15.629 --> 00:55:17.851]  Today, though, there is a new concern.
[00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:26.137]  Near Westside residents and business owners are calling on Mayor Brandon Johnson to shut down a shelter located at Walnut and Palina.
[00:55:26.537 --> 00:55:33.802]  It is situated just a few blocks away from the United Center, where the majority of convention activities, of course, will take place.
[00:55:34.402 --> 00:55:40.607]  And located just one block from Union Park, where many of the DNC protests will be held.
[00:55:41.168 --> 00:55:49.254]  Members of the Fulton Market Association say the shelter has brought on drug dealing, street fights, loud music, and loitering.
[00:55:49.594 --> 00:55:53.277]  They are demanding the city shut it down by September 30th.
[00:55:53.377 --> 00:55:57.941]  How can you be an illegal immigrant in the United States and not be guilty of loitering, no matter where you are?
[00:55:58.001 --> 00:55:59.322]  Here's a list of 400 calls to 911.
[00:56:02.188 --> 00:56:08.331]  From January through early May of this year, 400 calls.
[00:56:08.931 --> 00:56:17.554]  What we're saying to the mayor is that the only way Chicago survives, the only way, is we set our laws and we enforce our laws.
[00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:26.598]  And the mayor and the aldermen have said that this street, this street, and the entire corridor are for businesses only.
[00:56:27.138 --> 00:56:27.498]  Okay?
[00:56:28.138 --> 00:56:31.760]  We have to help our businesses survive and operate.
[00:56:34.472 --> 00:56:42.914]  As this afternoon's press conference was underway, some of the migrants living in that shelter became upset and confronted those hosting it.
[00:56:43.295 --> 00:56:46.415]  The situation was diffused by local officers.
[00:56:46.996 --> 00:56:57.759]  Over the last several months, the city has decompressed many of its migrant shelters, but there are still 5,500 living across 17 shelters.
[00:56:58.299 --> 00:57:01.460]  Reporting live downtown, Casey Cronus, Fox 32 Chicago.
[00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:04.987]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[00:57:05.887 --> 00:57:08.088]  And we've got an aerial shot here in clip number seven.
[00:57:08.108 --> 00:57:09.648]  We'll just use this as B-roll.
[00:57:09.668 --> 00:57:15.949]  I'd like for you to see this of the pro-Palestine protest flooding Chicago right now.
[00:57:15.989 --> 00:57:21.690]  So we're outside of this convention where everybody looks like a Maoist sort of uniform non-player character.
[00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:26.511]  We have this overhead shot of just hundreds of people in this shot.
[00:57:26.551 --> 00:57:33.052]  There are estimates that even upwards of 100,000 people are going to be protesting cumulatively over the course of the next several days.
[00:57:34.179 --> 00:57:40.161]  And in clip number eight here, we have the DNC protesters chanting, How many kids did you kill today?
[00:57:40.521 --> 00:57:45.002]  So even the left is eating itself at its own convention, which we are closely monitoring.
[00:57:45.022 --> 00:58:01.287]  And keep in mind, folks, before we run clip number eight and show you these protesters chanting, I want to remind you that Alex Jones is expected to be in studio within the next 30 minutes covering this live, as Joe Biden is expected to speak this evening, as Hillary Clinton is expected to speak this evening, and others
[00:58:01.787 --> 00:58:02.728]  So make sure you stay tuned.
[00:58:02.748 --> 00:58:09.373]  It's not going to be just me covering this at Infowars.com forward slash show, but it is going to be Alex Jones in studio before the end of the hour today.
[00:58:09.393 --> 00:58:12.796]  But let's let's go to clip number eight here and look at the protests that are happening right outside.
[00:58:27.988 --> 00:58:30.431]  I mean, I can't believe that there's a Palestinian rainbow flag.
[00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:33.173]  You realize what Hamas does to homosexuals, right?
[00:58:33.193 --> 00:58:37.057]  You realize what Hamas does to the LGBTQ plus community, right?
[00:58:37.197 --> 00:58:44.664]  You realize there's a reason that Algerian Olympians can't identify as the gender that they were naturally born if they don't display those.
[00:58:44.944 --> 00:58:47.306]  There's genitals despite having XY chromosomes, right?
[00:58:47.326 --> 00:58:53.250]  It's because these cultures totally reject the notion of anything outside the norm of heterosexual sex.
[00:58:53.571 --> 00:58:56.213]  Unless it's with your cousin, then that's also allowed, right?
[00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.654]  So this is totally untenable.
[00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:05.580]  Feminists and LGBT for free Palestine are chanting for abortion rights outside in clip number nine.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:11.024]  Unbelievable stuff here just displaying the hypocrisy and inconsistency and cognitive dissonance from the left.
[00:59:11.064 --> 00:59:11.424]  Let's run it.
[00:59:18.391 --> 00:59:21.293]  I just love the sound of a good whistle.
[00:59:22.354 --> 00:59:25.836]  Unbelievably annoying.
[00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:33.522]  In clip number 10 here, we have protesters dressed up as abortion pills walking near the DNC.
[00:59:33.582 --> 00:59:35.663]  This is a cult of death right before our eyes.
[00:59:35.703 --> 00:59:36.023]  Clip number 10.
[00:59:48.689 --> 00:59:51.815]  And in clip number 11 we have them chanting DNC go home.
[00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:56.964]  Probably the only thing I can agree with any of these protesters about is this chant here.
[00:59:57.505 --> 00:59:57.946]  Clip number 11.
[01:00:16.707 --> 01:00:30.380]  Now in clip number 17, I just want to give you the opportunity as the audience while we wait for these boring, no-name, not recognizable speakers at the DNC to get off the stage so we can see The Dementia in Chief speak and Hillary Clinton's Satan Incarnate speak.
[01:00:31.721 --> 01:00:46.871]  I want to show you clip number 17 because after all it is the Democratic National Convention for the Democratic Party, a party which constantly advocates for protecting our democracy and accuses anyone who's a MAGA Republican or any right of communist as a threat to democracy itself.
[01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:57.198]  Let's hear Kamala Harris in her own words in 17 describe and explain in a totally succinct and coherent way just what democracy is right before our eyes.
[01:00:57.258 --> 01:00:57.959]  Clip number 17.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.741]  That's what our election is about.
[01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:10.687]  Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy.
[01:01:12.388 --> 01:01:18.450]  As a democracy, we know there's a duality to the nature of democracy.
[01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:24.892]  On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact.
[01:01:25.832 --> 01:01:28.193]  What it does for its people.
[01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:45.483]  And you have to keep in mind, folks, everyone's talking about how Kamala Harris is ahead in all the polls.
[01:01:45.523 --> 01:01:49.764]  We know that Hillary's polls all said she was ahead when she got her butt kicked in 2016.
[01:01:50.205 --> 01:01:53.986]  Everyone's saying that Kamala Harris is more of a threat to Donald Trump than Joe Biden.
[01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:55.227]  But you got to keep in mind,
[01:01:56.266 --> 01:01:57.468]  Trump beat Joe Biden.
[01:01:57.508 --> 01:02:02.297]  He's out of the race because he was beat so badly before this convention even took place.
[01:02:03.482 --> 01:02:05.503]  Joe Biden beat Kamala.
[01:02:05.523 --> 01:02:10.605]  If you remember back what happened in 2020, she had like less than 1% of the support.
[01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:12.866]  She got absolutely murdered by Tulsi Gabbard in the debate.
[01:02:13.226 --> 01:02:15.287]  Joe Biden totally kicked her butt.
[01:02:15.507 --> 01:02:21.489]  It was unbelievable the extent to which she had no support, zero popularity, zero likability.
[01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:26.371]  And this is how her campaign unraveled before the Iowa caucus.
[01:02:26.411 --> 01:02:27.432]  Clip number one here.
[01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:32.414]  Let's run clip number one and unpack it on the other side while we wait for a relevant speaker to enter the stage here at the convention.
[01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:45.073]  How Kamala Harris' campaign unraveled, they obtained the resignation letter of the Harris campaign state operations director who is now joining the Bloomberg campaign.
[01:02:45.133 --> 01:02:52.158]  She wrote, it is unacceptable that with less than 90 days until Iowa, we still do not have a real plan to win.
[01:02:52.338 --> 01:03:00.963]  Our campaign for the people is made up of diverse talent which is being squandered by indecision and a lack of leaders
[01:03:01.443 --> 01:03:02.644]  No one read.
[01:03:02.664 --> 01:03:04.425]  She's like the embodiment of everybody's ex-girlfriend.
[01:03:27.936 --> 01:03:37.148]  Every voter that you meet on the campaign trail who goes to see her and the common theme is people want to like her and then she doesn't close the deal.
[01:03:37.228 --> 01:03:43.557]  She's not able to articulate a consistent and compelling message that makes those voters who show up for her
[01:03:43.857 --> 01:03:44.197]  Thanks a lot.
[01:03:44.217 --> 01:03:46.119]  And she's been all over the place in terms of message.
[01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:49.481]  Here's a clip to show some of her kind of all over the place messaging.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:05.940]  Truth.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.081]  Justice.
[01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:08.101]  Decency.
[01:04:08.521 --> 01:04:09.242]  Equality.
[01:04:09.902 --> 01:04:10.382]  Freedom.
[01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:14.044]  Our mother would sit up trying to figure out how to make it all work.
[01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.305]  That's something most Americans know all too well.
[01:04:17.985 --> 01:04:19.546]  And that's what my 3 a.m.
[01:04:19.586 --> 01:04:20.847]  agenda is all about.
[01:04:20.867 --> 01:04:22.887]  I know what she's been doing at 3 a.m.
[01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.528]  She'll bring us together.
[01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:26.449]  This is Trump.
[01:04:27.469 --> 01:04:30.891]  And in every possible way, this is the anti-Trump.
[01:04:33.075 --> 01:04:33.956]  And now to her.
[01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:35.518]  Do you see the look on her face?
[01:04:53.756 --> 01:05:02.004]  And Julie, this was a policy-heavy campaign, I think, in a way that some folks who got in didn't necessarily predict and maybe weren't ready for, and she has had issues with some of her policies.
[01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:25.943]  Speaking of zero likability, I just want to cut over right now to what's happening at the DNC.
[01:05:26.463 --> 01:05:30.245]  And you tell me, does this look or sound like a likable person to you?
[01:05:30.285 --> 01:05:31.046]  Go ahead and play it, please.
[01:05:33.727 --> 01:05:40.771]  Or an opportunity economy where we lower the costs of groceries, prescriptions, and housing.
[01:05:41.852 --> 01:05:47.015]  Where we go after big pharma, corporate landlords, and price gougers.
[01:05:48.823 --> 01:05:56.826]  Where there's no such thing as a man's job, or a woman's job, or like Donald Trump would say, a black job.
[01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:01.527]  Just a good union job!
[01:06:05.249 --> 01:06:09.810]  That's the future our President Joe Biden has fought for.
[01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:16.212]  And that's the future Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will keep fighting for.
[01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.933]  Let's build it together.
[01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:34.978]  Dude, they're playing on this Joy theme from Mao's campaign.
[01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:39.101]  The song in the background, it's all just phony.
[01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:45.646]  And what's interesting to me, I thought the RNC was a little bit, you know, I thought it was very boomery and it wasn't my taste aesthetically.
[01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:46.707]  I just thought it was kind of lame.
[01:06:47.287 --> 01:06:56.234]  But the level of uniform this is compared to the RMC is really indicative of the conformity that is demanded by the Democratic Party.
[01:06:56.274 --> 01:06:59.837]  The total lack of observation of individual rights or individuality.
[01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:06.439]  Are you as excited as I am?
[01:07:06.459 --> 01:07:06.499]  No.
[01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:13.964]  I've known Kamala Harris for almost 20 years.
[01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:20.408]  Our bond was forged years ago by a shared commitment to children.
[01:07:21.025 --> 01:07:21.285]  Uh-huh.
[01:07:21.726 --> 01:07:22.847]  The woman who has no children?
[01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:23.188]  No!
[01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.350]  The community does not get to raise my kids!
[01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:26.451]  They're my kids!
[01:07:26.491 --> 01:07:26.992]  Thank you.
[01:07:41.334 --> 01:07:55.239]  That's why when I was Speaker of the State Assembly and she was a prosecutor, we fought to address youth violence and reform the child welfare system.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:08.684]  We wanted to make sure that California's foster youth are caught and left on their own the day they turn 18.
[01:08:11.827 --> 01:08:24.430]  As Attorney General, Kamala created our state's Bureau of Children's Justice and worked to give children in the juvenile justice system the support they needed.
[01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:36.573]  And when I asked her to swear me in, the first woman vice president, swearing in the first woman mayor of Los Angeles,
[01:08:42.233 --> 01:08:49.895]  We knew we were sending a message to young girls everywhere that they, too, can lead.
[01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:59.577]  Now, I know Kamala, and she feels the importance of this work in her bones.
[01:09:00.977 --> 01:09:05.178]  When Kamala meets a young person, you can feel her passion.
[01:09:06.118 --> 01:09:10.921]  You can feel her heart and you can feel her fearlessness.
[01:09:12.061 --> 01:09:15.923]  That is what defines a commitment to children.
[01:09:16.744 --> 01:09:20.666]  Being willing to fight fiercely for every child.
[01:09:22.987 --> 01:09:27.610]  And trust me, Kamala has done that her entire life.
[01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:39.891]  So this November, we're gonna fight to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of these United States!
[01:09:39.931 --> 01:09:45.676]  Looks like it's gonna be her, Roger.
[01:09:57.398 --> 01:10:02.100]  Please welcome Grammy-nominated country music star Mickey Guyton.
[01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:07.282]  Grammy-nominated.
[01:10:07.362 --> 01:10:14.945]  How y'all doing?
[01:10:15.325 --> 01:10:22.689]  Alright, now they're gonna cut to this emotional garbage of this fake country star who didn't win a Grammy but was nominated.
[01:10:23.976 --> 01:10:25.857]  The, uh, nomination apparently never heard of her.
[01:10:25.897 --> 01:10:27.418]  Lived in Nashville, Tennessee for seven years.
[01:10:27.998 --> 01:10:29.319]  Knew a lot of people in the music business.
[01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.600]  Went to parties at John Rich's house.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:31.960]  Never met that woman.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.841]  Never heard of that woman.
[01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:33.501]  Maybe she's famous.
[01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:34.282]  She probably is.
[01:10:34.322 --> 01:10:34.822]  She's a Grammy.
[01:10:35.042 --> 01:10:35.482]  Jesus!
[01:10:40.245 --> 01:10:46.528]  And, uh, I, I, I'm almost at a loss for words at how frustrated I am.
[01:10:46.969 --> 01:10:52.932]  And I understand that it's natural that the Democrats will be running against Republicans and the Democrats will put up their candidate, but
[01:10:54.867 --> 01:11:05.030]  I'm feeling a great sense of nostalgia for a time in this country in which both Democrats and Republicans at least pretended to care about U.S.
[01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:17.573]  interests, American interests, the interests of the American people, and the only disagreement was the best way to manifest or enact policy to actually represent those interests.
[01:11:18.914 --> 01:11:23.975]  But now we're at a place where the Democrats, though they say they care about
[01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:31.269]  In the interest of the American working class people, all of the policies that they advocate are completely counterproductive to that aim.
[01:11:32.577 --> 01:11:39.819]  I mean, we're talking about a party that advocates for funding ally after ally after ally without funding the protection of our own border.
[01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.079]  And they say they want to protect our border, but they really don't.
[01:11:42.139 --> 01:11:45.560]  They only put forward laws or suggested bills or acts.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.100]  They have so many earmarks and there's no way they could pass.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.682]  And then they accuse Republicans of stopping increased border security and protection.
[01:11:52.902 --> 01:11:54.722]  They never take accountability for their failures.
[01:11:54.742 --> 01:11:59.103]  They didn't even take accountability for the failure in 2016 for them to win the presidential election.
[01:12:01.277 --> 01:12:04.920]  It was everybody's fault except for Hillary Clinton's that that presidential election took place.
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:10.085]  It was everybody's fault except Nancy Pelosi's, publicly speaking, that January 6th happened privately.
[01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:16.791]  She admitted on video, and those videos leaked, that she took full responsibility, that it was totally her fault, that she totally dropped the ball and she sucked as a human being and a leader.
[01:12:17.852 --> 01:12:21.476]  But publicly, it was all about these right-wing extremists and these domestic terrorists.
[01:12:22.397 --> 01:12:22.937]  Constantly.
[01:12:24.258 --> 01:12:27.001]  But when you look at policies coming from the Kamala camp,
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.143]  We're seriously looking at a Kamala cost of depopulation.
[01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:42.055]  When you put price caps on groceries in a Maoist policy, it inevitably leads to shortages because if businesses can't make money selling products or goods, then they will not sell those products or goods.
[01:12:42.095 --> 01:12:42.996]  They will not make them.
[01:12:43.036 --> 01:12:44.057]  They will not manufacture them.
[01:12:44.097 --> 01:12:44.998]  They will not import them.
[01:12:45.018 --> 01:12:45.839]  They will not trade them.
[01:12:46.059 --> 01:12:47.661]  And it leads to a massive shortage.
[01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:54.565]  So yeah, maybe it is possible to get gas for a dollar a gallon if you can find it, but you won't be able to find it anywhere.
[01:12:54.605 --> 01:13:01.887]  Maybe it is possible to get groceries for less than $100 for your whole family if you can find groceries, but all the shelves are empty when you price cap.
[01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:03.268]  This is very well documented.
[01:13:03.348 --> 01:13:08.929]  Everybody knows that these socialist CCP policies, these Marxist policies, these frankly communist policies.
[01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:23.607]  Only served to catalyze shortages and increased desperation, but the thing is, I don't even believe that these leftists, as stupid as they are, as retarded as they are, I don't even believe that these leftists believe that communist policies are the best.
[01:13:23.948 --> 01:13:28.490]  I think they understand that these policies lead to the total collapse of civilization.
[01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.490]  And the collapse is actually the goal.
[01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:38.534]  So rather than fighting over which tax policy is better for working class Americans and a functional government, what they're actually doing is fighting over
[01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:44.911]  Whether or not Donald Trump can save the economy or they can systematically handle its demise.
[01:13:44.931 --> 01:13:47.173]  Let's go back to this transgender emcee that they have right now.
[01:13:50.838 --> 01:13:53.742]  As we look ahead to our collective future,
[01:13:54.588 --> 01:13:59.611]  It's important to reflect on all the incredible progress that we've made in the last four years.
[01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:06.554]  The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient nation.
[01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:15.579]  They invested in critical infrastructure, delivered relief when disaster struck, and made healthcare more affordable.
[01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.591]  Kamala Harris cares.
[01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:22.093]  And unlike Donald Trump, she has a plan.
[01:14:22.733 --> 01:14:28.717]  Not just for the next four or eight years, but for generations to come.
[01:14:30.318 --> 01:14:41.364]  Now let's hear from some of my fellow state executives about how Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are investing in the long-term future for our nation.
[01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:46.062]  Okay, go.
[01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:46.202]  Go.
[01:14:46.222 --> 01:14:46.902]  I'm not getting on that!
[01:14:46.922 --> 01:14:47.242]  I'm not swimming!
[01:15:03.746 --> 01:15:07.468]  I'm the proud son of a Union bus driver from Pittsburgh.
[01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:13.852]  Every day, my dad would come home and tell me about how our roads and bridges were in disrepair.
[01:15:14.813 --> 01:15:19.216]  President Trump promised us infrastructure week over and over again.
[01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:23.298]  He really didn't care though, and it never happened.
[01:15:24.279 --> 01:15:28.702]  But President Biden and Vice President Harris are on our side.
[01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:36.413]  They brought together Democrats and Republicans to get it done.
[01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:41.698]  We got I-95 in Philly fixed in less than two weeks.
[01:15:45.201 --> 01:15:49.684]  We repaired the Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh in record time.
[01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:59.953]  Right now, we're repairing roads and bridges across Pennsylvania, including in Pittsburgh, the city of bridges.
[01:16:02.685 --> 01:16:05.449]  And Vice President Harris is looking forward.
[01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:10.075]  She's committed to keeping our infrastructure safe and modern.
[01:16:11.277 --> 01:16:18.107]  When I think about the future, I think about my daughter, Harper, and all of America's children.
[01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:22.120]  Investing in them means investing in our infrastructure.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.241]  It means replacing millions of lead pipes.
[01:16:25.861 --> 01:16:33.984]  It means providing clean air, clean water, safe roads and bridges, not just for us, but for generations to come.
[01:16:34.964 --> 01:16:38.565]  That's the legacy that President Biden is leaving our children.
[01:16:41.204 --> 01:16:45.967]  Let's keep building bridges to the future with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[01:16:46.447 --> 01:16:47.027]  Let's work!
[01:16:47.088 --> 01:16:47.488]  No, no, no.
[01:16:47.748 --> 01:16:50.710]  What Biden is leaving is a legacy of lies.
[01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:53.091]  And what we get, we get it from the right, too.
[01:16:53.371 --> 01:16:58.734]  But what we really get from the left, incessantly from the left, is just lie after lie after lie after lie.
[01:16:58.754 --> 01:16:59.575]  Let's run clip number 26.
[01:16:59.835 --> 01:17:00.656]  Derek, put this together.
[01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:15.446]  I mean, here's just another example of them repeating lies similar to the Charlottesville lie about accusing Trump of saying that Nazis were very fine people even though in the same moment of that clip he explicitly stated that Nazis were not very fine people and that white supremacists should be disavowed abundantly.
[01:17:15.786 --> 01:17:22.451]  We've got clip number 26 where they just double down, triple down, quadruple down on the lie that he encouraged people to inject bleach into their veins.
[01:17:22.491 --> 01:17:23.031]  Clip 26.
[01:17:24.572 --> 01:17:28.915]  What we needed at that moment was national leadership.
[01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:30.877]  But instead
[01:17:31.863 --> 01:17:32.983]  We got Donald Trump.
[01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:44.265]  While schools closed and dead bodies filled morgues, Donald Trump downplayed the virus.
[01:17:45.205 --> 01:17:48.566]  He told us to inject bleach into our bodies.
[01:17:49.346 --> 01:17:53.227]  He peddled conspiracy theories across the country.
[01:17:53.987 --> 01:18:00.408]  We lost hundreds of thousands of Americans and our economy collapsed.
[01:18:02.828 --> 01:18:04.549]  Now that summer of 2020.
[01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:05.250]  All right.
[01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:13.376]  All right, let's see what this wretched woman is saying on stage in her pink Professor Umbridge suit.
[01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:24.986]  And they negotiated down the prices of 10 more life-saving drugs like Eliquis and Jardians for Americans on Medicare.
[01:18:26.215 --> 01:18:29.476]  Obviously not Ozempic as far as she's concerned, am I right?
[01:18:54.232 --> 01:18:57.855]  Kamala Harris is fighting for that healthy future.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.483]  Let me tell y'all about Texas leadership.
[01:19:11.648 --> 01:19:18.093]  I'm County Executive Lena Hidalgo and I serve the five million residents of Harris County.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.801]  Harris County includes Houston.
[01:19:24.821 --> 01:19:33.064]  Texas Governor Ann Richards said, I've been tested by fire, and the fire lost.
[01:19:36.726 --> 01:19:41.067]  In the years I've been in office, we've dealt with chemical fires.
[01:19:41.808 --> 01:19:49.751]  We've dealt with 10 floods, 7 hurricanes, a deadly winter freeze, and of course the pandemic.
[01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:56.023]  When that last disaster struck, Donald Trump abandoned us.
[01:19:57.784 --> 01:20:01.726]  He spread misinformation that cost lives.
[01:20:02.726 --> 01:20:03.406]  Compare that to 2021.
[01:20:05.496 --> 01:20:25.250]  Yeah because you wouldn't approve, the Department of Energy wouldn't approve burning beyond the limit of coal in order to restore energy and like dozens of people froze to death because all we had were windmills and the Department of Energy wouldn't approve us burning coal to provide the energy despite Abbott's request.
[01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:30.353]  The leftists literally let Texans die during that freeze and they're trying to blame Trump for it.
[01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:31.294]  It's disgusting.
[01:20:32.074 --> 01:20:41.579]  The very week she launched her campaign, she was down in Texas with vital FEMA assistance right after Hurricane Beryl.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.001]  Kamala Harris cares.
[01:20:45.261 --> 01:20:49.644]  She will never risk lives for the sake of politics.
[01:20:50.404 --> 01:20:55.047]  And she's leading the charge to protect our communities from extreme weather.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:04.165]  The Biden-Harris administration have announced at least a billion dollars to help us with just that, and Houston is thriving.
[01:21:06.547 --> 01:21:16.374]  We deserve leaders who acknowledge the threats, heck, the existence of climate change.
[01:21:17.454 --> 01:21:17.715]  Heck!
[01:21:17.895 --> 01:21:20.717]  We deserve tough leaders who have our backs.
[01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:25.160]  We deserve compassionate leaders ready to help
[01:21:26.309 --> 01:21:29.112]  That's Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[01:21:33.376 --> 01:21:41.624]  I can personally attest that Kamala is a leader who has our back!
[01:21:42.885 --> 01:21:46.509]  I'm California's Lieutenant General... When did she get fired from the Blue Man Group?
[01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:52.986]  But I hold another title just as dear to me.
[01:21:53.607 --> 01:21:56.289]  Kamala Harris' friend.
[01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:04.336]  I met her when we were both young women trying to navigate the halls of power.
[01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:06.431]  I worked in housing.
[01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:10.453]  She had just been elected district attorney.
[01:22:11.173 --> 01:22:13.413]  We got frequent lunches together.
[01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:16.954]  Can you guys find a picture of them together?
[01:22:17.014 --> 01:22:19.495]  She was also a great mentor.
[01:22:20.856 --> 01:22:28.858]  Once, I told her about a professional experience of being minimized because I was a woman.
[01:22:29.884 --> 01:22:39.096]  She put her fork down and said, Eleni, never let anybody make you feel small.
[01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:41.238]  Which was weird because we were eating soup.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.644]  I saw her put that creed into action.
[01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:57.215]  When Wall Street foreclosed on millions of homes, Washington wisdom was that $4 billion was the best you could do.
[01:22:57.875 --> 01:22:59.896]  Other attorneys general agreed.
[01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:10.921]  But because Kamala Harris grew up in a middle-class home, she knew that wasn't enough for all the working families who got screwed over.
[01:23:11.901 --> 01:23:12.942]  Look at them stage.
[01:23:12.962 --> 01:23:16.583]  They're like, they're just like choreographed.
[01:23:34.452 --> 01:23:44.198]  That if you're lucky enough to be her friend, she calls you on her birthday, and sometimes... She calls you on her birthday?
[01:23:44.518 --> 01:23:45.539]  It's my birthday!
[01:23:45.579 --> 01:23:47.000]  She called me on mine.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.742]  Right when I decided to run for Lieutenant Governor.
[01:23:51.262 --> 01:23:53.524]  Who called somebody else on their birthday?
[01:23:53.544 --> 01:23:56.567]  That's not all you shattered.
[01:23:56.587 --> 01:23:58.889]  You basically shattered California.
[01:24:10.539 --> 01:24:11.260]  I live there, it's hell.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:17.245]  I'm so glad the country is getting to see the Kamala that I've known for decades.
[01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:30.015]  For Californians and Pennsylvanians, for Texans and Wisconsinites, for states red and blue and everything in between.
[01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:38.202]  President Biden and Vice President Harris have been investing in our future and are on our side.
[01:24:38.937 --> 01:24:54.025]  I got married so I only had to listen to one woman yell at me.
[01:24:54.105 --> 01:24:58.568]  Oh, they're just going to try to just associate Project 2025 with Trump?
[01:24:58.728 --> 01:25:02.250]  The 900-page document that nobody's read that Trump has said he doesn't have anything to do with.
[01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:03.370]  They're just going to lie again?
[01:25:03.931 --> 01:25:05.431]  These people.
[01:25:05.832 --> 01:25:07.913]  I don't even know where to begin with these people.
[01:25:08.957 --> 01:25:09.717]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[01:25:09.757 --> 01:25:18.722]  And this is all happening because they run these ads and they try to push monkey pox on us and they try to push bird flus and cat flus and monkey flus and all this BS.
[01:25:18.782 --> 01:25:22.944]  Let's just watch clip number two from the non-riot protest clips.
[01:25:23.304 --> 01:25:29.007]  This is the Simpsons predictive programming of the house cat flu COVID clip.
[01:25:29.447 --> 01:25:30.407]  Unbelievable how many times.
[01:25:30.427 --> 01:25:32.668]  The Simpsons has probably been right as many times as Alex Jones.
[01:25:32.948 --> 01:25:33.709]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:34.069]  Let's watch.
[01:25:46.738 --> 01:25:47.599]  We're unbalanced!
[01:25:47.899 --> 01:25:48.840]  It's not fair!
[01:25:53.964 --> 01:25:57.566]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[01:25:58.027 --> 01:26:06.113]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[01:26:06.533 --> 01:26:10.136]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[01:26:11.537 --> 01:26:13.459]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
[01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:13.879]  Yeah.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:15.881]  A new disease.
[01:26:16.141 --> 01:26:16.761]  No one's immune.
[01:26:17.082 --> 01:26:20.364]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[01:26:20.544 --> 01:26:22.225]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[01:26:22.446 --> 01:26:27.129]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:28.710]  He loves being that guy.
[01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:31.232]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.154]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[01:26:33.414 --> 01:26:37.737]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:41.360]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.420]  Get over here, NBC.
[01:26:44.742 --> 01:27:06.010]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... And so while the Simpsons is predicting this next fake crisis, and while the leftists are trying to push this fake crisis, whether it's monkey pox, or the bird flu, or another WHO crisis that's coming out, we literally have outside of the DNC right now outstanding reporting from Savannah Hernandez.
[01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:12.395]  Of these protesters today, knocking down fences, overcoming barricades.
[01:27:12.415 --> 01:27:13.456]  This is clips 23 and 24.
[01:27:13.516 --> 01:27:15.677]  Let's just run them back to back as one clip.
[01:27:16.078 --> 01:27:18.059]  You guys have to see what's happening right outside.
[01:27:18.079 --> 01:27:20.962]  It's like J6 all over again, but they're acting like nothing is happening.
[01:27:20.982 --> 01:27:21.482]  23 and 24, please.
[01:27:35.482 --> 01:27:36.363]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:57.113 --> 01:28:13.759]  So while these deluded leftists are inside giving these speeches about how long they've been friends with Kamala Harris and how long they've been friends with Joe Biden and how much they care, while these strangers to our eyes come out, people that we've never heard of or seen before, and just speak accolades
[01:28:14.139 --> 01:28:14.439]  We're good.
[01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:15.180]  We're good.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:15.620]  We're good.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.140]  We're good.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:16.581]  We're good.
[01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:17.001]  We're good.
[01:28:17.021 --> 01:28:17.581]  We're good.
[01:28:17.601 --> 01:28:17.981]  We're good.
[01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:18.322]  We're good.
[01:28:18.342 --> 01:28:18.622]  We're good.
[01:28:18.682 --> 01:28:19.282]  We're good.
[01:28:19.322 --> 01:28:19.823]  We're good.
[01:28:19.843 --> 01:28:20.123]  We're good.
[01:28:20.143 --> 01:28:20.603]  We're good.
[01:28:20.663 --> 01:28:20.983]  We're good.
[01:28:21.003 --> 01:28:21.243]  We're good.
[01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:21.764]  We're good.
[01:28:21.784 --> 01:28:22.244]  We're good.
[01:28:22.284 --> 01:28:22.925]  We're good.
[01:28:22.945 --> 01:28:23.305]  We're good.
[01:28:23.325 --> 01:28:23.525]  We're good.
[01:28:23.545 --> 01:28:24.085]  We're good.
[01:28:24.325 --> 01:28:24.786]  We're good.
[01:28:24.806 --> 01:28:25.266]  We're good.
[01:28:25.346 --> 01:28:25.606]  We're good.
[01:28:25.626 --> 01:28:25.926]  We're good.
[01:28:25.946 --> 01:28:26.287]  We're good.
[01:28:26.327 --> 01:28:26.547]  We're good.
[01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:26.907]  We're good.
[01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:27.327]  We're good.
[01:28:27.367 --> 01:28:27.687]  We're good.
[01:28:27.707 --> 01:28:28.448]  We're good.
[01:28:28.508 --> 01:28:29.048]  We're good.
[01:28:29.128 --> 01:28:30.009]  We're good.
[01:28:30.029 --> 01:28:30.529]  We're good.
[01:28:30.549 --> 01:28:30.949]  We're good.
[01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.470]  We're good.
[01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.930]  We're good.
[01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.390]  We're good.
[01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:32.831]  We're good.
[01:28:33.211 --> 01:28:33.851]  We're good.
[01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:34.151]  We're good.
[01:28:34.171 --> 01:28:34.512]  We're good.
[01:28:34.532 --> 01:28:34.792]  We're good.
[01:28:34.812 --> 01:28:35.132]  We're good.
[01:28:35.152 --> 01:28:35.352]  We're good.
[01:28:35.392 --> 01:28:35.612]  We're good.
[01:28:35.632 --> 01:28:35.873]  We're good.
[01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:36.293]  We're good.
[01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:36.773]  We're good.
[01:28:36.793 --> 01:28:37.093]  We're good.
[01:28:37.113 --> 01:28:37.353]  We're good.
[01:28:37.373 --> 01:28:37.634]  We're good.
[01:28:37.654 --> 01:28:37.894]  We're good.
[01:28:37.914 --> 01:28:38.154]  We're good.
[01:28:38.214 --> 01:28:38.474]  We're good.
[01:28:43.197 --> 01:28:45.118]  The Onion Swamp as it's named after.
[01:28:47.038 --> 01:28:51.860]  We have countless examples of just leftist lawlessness.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.801]  And I'm not somebody who's just law and order for the sake of law and order.
[01:28:54.841 --> 01:29:00.684]  I don't like the firm boot of the state coming down and just mandates and regulations and crazy arrests like we're seeing in the UK.
[01:29:00.724 --> 01:29:08.526]  I don't like that kind of law and order where everybody who ever says anything that's considered political dissidence is locked up for months upon months in prison.
[01:29:08.546 --> 01:29:09.587]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[01:29:09.847 --> 01:29:12.228]  I'm talking about reasonable actual laws
[01:29:12.788 --> 01:29:19.216]  Where when you destroy property, when you threaten and endanger the lives of people, you're held accountable for that, and you're encouraged not to do that.
[01:29:19.296 --> 01:29:30.930]  Not sponsored by Kamala Harris, who herself bailed protesters out as they burned cities and walls as a state, and then lied about it, even though her tweet was still up, and then doubled down in a lie about it.
[01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:31.771]  I mean, they lie.
[01:29:32.111 --> 01:29:38.420]  Just as much about the accomplishments and virtues of Kamala Harris as they lie about the vices of Donald Trump.
[01:29:38.621 --> 01:29:40.243]  They cannot stop lying about it.
[01:29:40.263 --> 01:29:46.352]  I'm not sure if we have the Savannah clip ready yet, but this is absolutely amazing reporting on the ground from Savannah.
[01:29:46.372 --> 01:29:46.993]  Let's watch right now.
[01:29:49.534 --> 01:29:50.554]  We're good to go.
[01:30:10.811 --> 01:30:11.772]  Unbelievable.
[01:30:30.973 --> 01:30:39.536]  So not only do we have the ridiculousness of this protest which is for some reason so adamantly in support of Palestine despite the fact that it's not the United States of America.
[01:30:39.616 --> 01:30:40.817]  These are not American people.
[01:30:40.877 --> 01:30:43.638]  American people are suffering but nobody protests on behalf of them.
[01:30:43.858 --> 01:30:58.884]  But you simultaneously have these leftists with the Palestinian flag juxtaposed to rainbow versions of it despite the fact that the people of Palestine would throw homosexuals off of roofs similar to other Middle Eastern countries where 40% of marriages are between first and second cousins.
[01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:08.496]  But you have them committing acts similar to January 6th where they're overthrowing barricades and they're storming and law enforcement and police have to be brought in.
[01:31:08.776 --> 01:31:17.939]  I mean this is a Democratic National Convention and one of the reasons they came down so hard on January 6th's protesters was because they were attempting to interfere with a so-called
[01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:23.901]  Democratic process, an election itself, the certification of the election of who would be the President of the United States.
[01:31:23.961 --> 01:31:27.983]  That was what was so clandestine about it, what was so immoral about it.
[01:31:28.003 --> 01:31:36.087]  But now we have the same exact activity from the left, right outside of a Democratic National Convention, where they're trying to formalize a coup, folks.
[01:31:36.906 --> 01:31:43.451]  We have protesters trying to interfere with the formalization of a coup, and inside, they're just like this.
[01:31:43.471 --> 01:31:48.574]  They're in pink suits, just so happy and delighted to be there, pretending that nothing outside is happening at all.
[01:31:49.915 --> 01:31:53.077]  California delegates, make some noise!
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.582]  It's great to see so many familiar faces.
[01:32:01.803 --> 01:32:02.184]  Oh, please.
[01:32:02.224 --> 01:32:03.805]  Do you recognize everybody in the crowd?
[01:32:08.604 --> 01:32:15.027]  And I can't forget the state that I was born and raised in.
[01:32:16.248 --> 01:32:19.709]  Mississippi Democrats, let everybody hear you!
[01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:33.716]  Democrats, before I joined the Senate, I was a leader in the labor movement.
[01:32:37.455 --> 01:32:42.696]  So I know a champion for the people when I see one.
[01:32:44.456 --> 01:32:52.878]  I met Kamala Harris when she was district attorney and I was president of a large care workers union.
[01:32:54.338 --> 01:32:55.819]  We hit it off right away.
[01:32:57.179 --> 01:33:02.280]  What really impressed me was how well she got to know my family.
[01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:05.100]  That's not how it works, lady.
[01:33:32.654 --> 01:33:36.578]  We both graduated from historically black colleges.
[01:33:40.561 --> 01:33:43.804]  Me from Jackson State University.
[01:33:43.824 --> 01:33:50.771]  The vice president from Howard University.
[01:33:53.613 --> 01:33:58.178]  We were both raised by mothers who worked fiercely to provide for us.
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:09.670]  And we both believe that every single one of us has the power to change the world when we choose to do it together.
[01:34:11.893 --> 01:34:15.957]  You see, Kamala Harris has always understood the assignment.
[01:34:17.282 --> 01:34:26.524]  No matter if she were the underdog, no matter the bullying or the name-calling, she never doubted that our best was still ahead.
[01:34:26.844 --> 01:34:38.207]  So while this woman rambles on about her lesbian relationship and her adopted daughter, I assume adopted daughter, and now her daughter has the right to be the vice president because she called it, dibs.
[01:34:39.187 --> 01:34:44.008]  Let's see what real working class black folks are saying outside of the DNC right now in Club 27.
[01:34:47.961 --> 01:34:48.921]  What do you guys think about Kamala?
[01:34:48.941 --> 01:34:50.002]  She's terrible.
[01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:51.762]  If she comes into office, it will be done.
[01:34:51.922 --> 01:35:03.245]  It'll be cool to see a female black, you know, she's half black, not fully black, but it'll be cool to see a black president, female black president, but I'm definitely voting for Trump.
[01:35:03.505 --> 01:35:04.266]  Let me tell you something.
[01:35:04.286 --> 01:35:12.348]  She tries to get the black vote because if you look at her past things and maybe 10, 15 years ago, when she's in interviews, she identifies as West Indian.
[01:35:12.388 --> 01:35:16.429]  The only way that she's identified as African American is right now.
[01:35:16.909 --> 01:35:20.612]  I don't even know if she was the vice president.
[01:35:32.701 --> 01:35:35.784]  These women know she's West Indian, but they didn't know she was the VP.
[01:35:36.024 --> 01:35:45.533]  And I'm so sorry if that may ruffle people's feathers, but I have done my own research, and Trump has done a lot for us, more than what the media tries to portray.
[01:35:45.593 --> 01:35:55.582]  They're getting all our favorite rappers, they're having Megan Thee Stallion swerve, and all of that, to gain, because they think that that's gonna make us vote for them, and it's not!
[01:35:55.882 --> 01:35:57.823]  Alright, let's go back to Pink Suit.
[01:35:57.863 --> 01:35:59.403]  Let's see what she's saying.
[01:36:16.073 --> 01:36:23.378]  Bragging about having ripped away a woman's freedom to choose what she does with her own body is unthinkable.
[01:36:23.639 --> 01:36:27.782]  And Democrats, Americans, we deserve better!
[01:36:31.144 --> 01:36:37.369]  We deserve, we deserve a president who is tough, not just tough-talking.
[01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:44.194]  One who shatters the boundaries of what's possible, not the boundaries of what's legal.
[01:36:45.675 --> 01:36:48.457]  I just can't wait to see who's next.
[01:37:18.664 --> 01:37:19.725]  Packed house folks!
[01:37:20.205 --> 01:37:20.806]  Looks great!
[01:37:24.209 --> 01:37:25.169]  Hi everyone!
[01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:32.155]  I'm Deja Fox and I'm so excited to be here today from Arizona!
[01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:37.610]  Joe Biden just gave me a blanket, now I've got monkey pox.
[01:37:56.474 --> 01:38:04.877]  Meanwhile, there's actual Planned Parenthood mobile vans outside where you can waltz in.
[01:38:04.897 --> 01:38:08.458]  Two people can walk into a Planned Parenthood van and one person walks out.
[01:38:08.518 --> 01:38:09.919]  Right outside the DNC.
[01:38:09.999 --> 01:38:14.801]  Just walk in, abortion, boop, done.
[01:38:16.661 --> 01:38:23.864]  Not some power-hungry millionaire reality TV personality who only cares about himself.
[01:38:25.078 --> 01:38:26.999]  We need Kamala Harris.
[01:38:29.682 --> 01:38:35.607]  She'll deliver a future where we can decide if and when to start a family.
[01:38:36.207 --> 01:38:39.590]  A future where we can afford rent and groceries.
[01:38:39.771 --> 01:38:42.773]  A future where we're not crushed under students.
[01:38:42.893 --> 01:38:48.178]  And a future where any free lunch kid can walk through the gates of their dream college.
[01:38:48.578 --> 01:38:49.439]  For young people
[01:38:51.561 --> 01:38:53.543]  This is a fight for our future.
[01:38:54.044 --> 01:39:02.893]  We have a responsibility to do this, and we have a responsibility to do it right, and that's why we're gonna show up for Kamala Harris and Tim Walsh.
[01:39:03.934 --> 01:39:07.517]  And here now, with a musical performance, is Jason Isbell.
[01:39:07.658 --> 01:39:08.118]  Thank you.
[01:39:08.138 --> 01:39:09.800]  Alright, well...
[01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:12.151]  Musical performance.
[01:39:12.171 --> 01:39:13.092]  We can just skip this.
[01:39:13.172 --> 01:39:13.852]  Nobody cares.
[01:39:14.892 --> 01:39:18.154]  They have to bring in these celebrities because they don't have any real support.
[01:39:18.174 --> 01:39:23.716]  I bet you half the people are there just because of the artists, even though they're just Grammy nominated and not actually Grammy winners.
[01:39:24.476 --> 01:39:26.137]  Just wait till they bring out Bruce Springsteen.
[01:39:26.157 --> 01:39:27.357]  That's probably for Tim Walz.
[01:39:27.397 --> 01:39:29.898]  I bet you, I bet you a million bucks Bruce Springsteen.
[01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.839]  Opens for Tim Walz on Wednesday.
[01:39:34.119 --> 01:39:36.000]  Just that blue collar communist trash.
[01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:37.981]  The mayor of nothing.
[01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:39.041]  The mayor of rock and roll.
[01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:40.462]  The assistant mayor of rock and roll.
[01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:42.682]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:39:42.742 --> 01:39:45.384]  And now we have protesters at Clip 12.
[01:39:46.085 --> 01:39:59.015]  Let's just run Clip 12, Clip 13, Clip 14, and Clip 15 and 16, 12 through 16, back to back so you can see some of these highlights of the protests happening outside while these leftists celebrate inside.
[01:40:26.835 --> 01:40:34.358]  I've never in my life saw this at a Republican rally, but behind me you have Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
[01:40:34.638 --> 01:40:38.240]  I don't know if that, is that also Kamala Harris?
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:41.742]  I have no clue, but look at the, look at the fangs coming off of them.
[01:40:43.278 --> 01:40:44.919]  Look at the blood dripping down them.
[01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:49.442]  I don't know if they're like dead or if they just really dislike Joe Biden.
[01:40:49.462 --> 01:40:57.688]  But point of this being, you don't see this at any Republican rallies, any Republican protests, which we really don't even have protests, but they do.
[01:40:58.208 --> 01:40:59.189]  And this is what you see.
[01:40:59.209 --> 01:41:01.950]  They have never been more divided than they are right now.
[01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.952]  Look at this behind me.
[01:41:03.992 --> 01:41:04.852]  I don't know what else to say.
[01:41:13.895 --> 01:41:14.796]  Wearing a mask.
[01:41:14.956 --> 01:41:22.600]  Pre-Palestine stormed the stage earlier today, I believe.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:29.064]  You can't even hold it together at their own protest.
[01:41:29.084 --> 01:41:29.604]  Their own event.
[01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:45.970]  Racist, sexist, anti-gay!
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.791]  Christian fascists go away!
[01:41:49.391 --> 01:41:52.753]  Racist, sexist, anti-gay!
[01:41:52.793 --> 01:41:56.914]  Do you know who's racist, sexist, and anti-gay?
[01:41:56.974 --> 01:41:57.654]  Palestine.
[01:41:57.954 --> 01:42:02.036]  Look, I'm not for Israel just bombing these people indiscriminately.
[01:42:03.058 --> 01:42:04.059]  I'm no fan of Israel.
[01:42:04.099 --> 01:42:06.540]  I'd rather put America first than Israel any day of the week.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:07.441]  Not even close.
[01:42:07.501 --> 01:42:18.507]  Not even a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a
[01:42:30.583 --> 01:42:33.885]  I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you.
[01:42:34.466 --> 01:42:36.527]  That's how I feel when I'm faced with these leftists.
[01:42:37.008 --> 01:42:54.400]  I don't understand how it is that despite all of the evidence, I mean just taking 15 minutes to look some of this stuff up, how abundantly obvious it is that everything the leftists say is a lie, an evil, evil lie for the sake of self empowerment at the expense of any innocent person whatsoever.
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:04.046]  For the sake of the total conglomeration of all political power into one new world government, new world order, globalist cabal, how is it that anybody could fall for that?
[01:43:04.126 --> 01:43:09.890]  How is it that anybody could be so impassioned to go out there with a rainbow Palestine flag hybrid?
[01:43:11.711 --> 01:43:12.692]  It's like a chimera.
[01:43:12.712 --> 01:43:23.159]  It's an unnatural manifestation of ideologies that are naturally totally incompatible with one another, distorted in some satanic form of genetic manipulation in the form of a flag right before our eyes.
[01:43:24.465 --> 01:43:27.907]  This is happening all outside while these leftists in blue suits lie to us.
[01:43:28.287 --> 01:43:30.067]  Right now, a new speaker at the convention.
[01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:34.529]  Hello, Democrats!
[01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:35.830]  Hello, Chicago!
[01:43:35.850 --> 01:43:43.093]  It's a great honor for me to be here this evening.
[01:43:44.774 --> 01:43:53.818]  You know, long before I was the governor of Rhode Island, I was a little girl
[01:43:55.117 --> 01:44:07.043]  Growing up there in a middle-class family, my dad found his American dream in a watch factory in Providence.
[01:44:08.104 --> 01:44:19.789]  And that job, that job gave him a way to provide for our family, a community for him to belong to, and so much pride.
[01:44:22.171 --> 01:44:24.012]  But like so many Americans in the 80s,
[01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:35.234]  After 25 years of his hard work, his job and the job of all of his friends was shipped overseas.
[01:44:37.495 --> 01:44:47.380]  You know, years later, my dad said to me, Gina, this happened because our leaders let us down.
[01:44:49.241 --> 01:44:50.462]  And my father was right.
[01:44:51.523 --> 01:44:54.064]  The Republicans in power who pushed
[01:44:54.631 --> 01:44:56.993]  Failed economic strategy.
[01:44:57.614 --> 01:45:01.977]  Let's just cut taxes for the wealthy and leave everybody else behind.
[01:45:03.298 --> 01:45:09.824]  Well, not only did my father lose his job, but frankly, manufacturing left my state.
[01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:15.408]  Manufacturing withered in Rhode Island and all across this nation.
[01:45:16.649 --> 01:45:19.331]  In communities all across America.
[01:45:20.612 --> 01:45:22.314]  Factories shuttered.
[01:45:23.365 --> 01:45:36.751]  Communities got hollowed out, and people were left without their job, without hope, without the dignity that comes with a decent job.
[01:45:40.053 --> 01:45:45.496]  And you know, Republican economics failed Rhode Island.
[01:45:46.496 --> 01:45:47.557]  How do I know that?
[01:45:48.517 --> 01:45:50.018]  Because when I took office,
[01:45:50.791 --> 01:45:54.273]  First Democrat, elected governor in a couple of decades.
[01:45:55.393 --> 01:45:58.975]  I inherited one of the worst economies in the country.
[01:45:59.015 --> 01:45:59.855]  It was a mess.
[01:46:01.276 --> 01:46:04.357]  But we got to work and we turned it around.
[01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:12.861]  We turned it around with a pro-business, pro-worker agenda.
[01:46:14.622 --> 01:46:18.044]  Kamala Harris has that same agenda.
[01:46:20.285 --> 01:46:29.670]  She knows we need an economy where the costs are low and opportunities abound.
[01:46:32.072 --> 01:46:39.016]  An economy where people can show up to their jobs with dignity and pride.
[01:46:40.957 --> 01:46:44.319]  She has a new economic vision for America.
[01:46:44.339 --> 01:46:47.681]  You know how she knows that?
[01:46:49.173 --> 01:46:54.594]  She knows it because just like me, Kamala Harris grew up in a middle-class home.
[01:46:56.534 --> 01:47:02.735]  Her mom worked to cure breast cancer by day and feed her family at night.
[01:47:04.596 --> 01:47:12.557]  And as an adult, Kamala worked to lock up sex offenders and violent criminals by day.
[01:47:14.098 --> 01:47:16.278]  And she took care of her sick mother at night.
[01:47:18.536 --> 01:47:20.678]  Kamala Harris gets it.
[01:47:20.778 --> 01:47:32.188]  She gets that so, so many Americans work so hard every day and they're barely getting by.
[01:47:32.908 --> 01:47:34.890]  And that is not right.
[01:47:36.311 --> 01:47:39.814]  It is a fundamental economic principle.
[01:47:40.355 --> 01:47:42.436]  Hard work ought to pay off.
[01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.520]  We believe in that.
[01:47:48.257 --> 01:47:53.939]  And that's why the Vice President is committed to building the opportunity economy.
[01:47:53.959 --> 01:47:57.500]  An economy that rewards ambition.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.421]  An economy that rewards hard work.
[01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:16.165]  She believes in an America where everyone, regardless of who you are, what you have, where you started, you got a chance to get ahead in this country.
[01:48:19.844 --> 01:48:26.650]  Kamala Harris will give more than 100 middle class Americans a tax cut.
[01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:32.514]  She'll build 3 million new homes for the middle class.
[01:48:34.496 --> 01:48:40.160]  And she's going to forge an economy with fair competition, free from monopolies.
[01:48:40.921 --> 01:48:45.645]  Monopolies that crush workers and small businesses and startups.
[01:48:48.007 --> 01:48:49.048]  Kamala Harris
[01:48:49.895 --> 01:48:58.459]  will make building up the middle class a defining goal of her presidency.
[01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:14.486]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump, he's going to double down on his worst economic ideas.
[01:49:15.486 --> 01:49:19.028]  The same ideas that ship my dad's job overseas.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:23.100]  Ideas that don't work.
[01:49:24.281 --> 01:49:28.402]  We know they don't work because they never have.
[01:49:30.022 --> 01:49:33.483]  He wants another huge tax cut for the wealthy.
[01:49:35.383 --> 01:49:38.824]  He wants to put his corrupt buddies in charge of the economy.
[01:49:40.284 --> 01:49:44.545]  And he wants a sales tax that's going to supercharge inflation.
[01:49:45.125 --> 01:49:50.126]  We cannot afford Donald Trump's failed economic ideas.
[01:49:54.588 --> 01:49:55.549]  But here's the thing.
[01:49:57.610 --> 01:49:59.092]  The most important thing.
[01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:04.456]  Kamala Harris works for the people.
[01:50:06.137 --> 01:50:08.719]  Kamala Harris works for you.
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.623]  And Donald Trump is in it for himself.
[01:50:16.286 --> 01:50:24.052]  As our president, Kamala Harris will build an economy where everyone
[01:50:25.541 --> 01:50:33.766]  And she means everyone can find and live their American dream.
[01:50:34.507 --> 01:50:37.208]  So let's put her in the Oval Office.
[01:50:37.789 --> 01:50:38.309]  Thank you.
[01:50:54.495 --> 01:51:02.100]  I am a lifelong Republican, a former Trump voter, and I will not be voting for Trump in 2024.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.801]  My name is Norma.
[01:51:04.081 --> 01:51:07.243]  I'm from Carson, Washington, and I am a two-time
[01:51:07.853 --> 01:51:08.354]  Trump voter.
[01:51:08.894 --> 01:51:11.797]  I will not be voting for Trump this time around.
[01:51:12.038 --> 01:51:15.922]  I'm actually embarrassed to say that I did vote for Trump in 2016.
[01:51:15.962 --> 01:51:19.786]  Donald Trump has nothing but contempt for the American people.
[01:51:19.886 --> 01:51:22.569]  And ironically, for those who claim to be his fans.
[01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:25.633]  He's only interested in bidding fitting himself personally.
[01:51:25.753 --> 01:51:28.116]  Everything he said he would do, he did not do.
[01:51:28.856 --> 01:51:33.878]  I do not trust that he can do the right thing anymore.
[01:51:34.078 --> 01:51:38.479]  We've seen what Donald Trump really is and it disgusts me to my core.
[01:51:38.519 --> 01:51:39.919]  I don't think the man can be trusted.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.420]  He talks out of both sides of his mouth.
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.621]  He's a very dishonest person.
[01:51:45.481 --> 01:51:48.082]  I hate the way he disrespects women.
[01:51:48.582 --> 01:51:52.283]  Voting against Trump and for Kamala Harris is the right thing to do.
[01:52:00.606 --> 01:52:03.868]  Please welcome New York Governor Kathy Hochul.
[01:52:09.171 --> 01:52:13.794]  Hochul, who wants to forcibly inject you and put you in camps and take all your rights away.
[01:52:13.854 --> 01:52:16.096]  What a monstrous pig woman.
[01:52:17.617 --> 01:52:21.559]  Let's go full screen with this evil chipmunk.
[01:52:21.579 --> 01:52:24.321]  Ready to elect Kamala Harris.
[01:52:25.114 --> 01:52:28.015]  The first president of the United States?
[01:52:28.515 --> 01:52:29.515]  Yes, you are!
[01:52:30.155 --> 01:52:31.115]  Yes, you are!
[01:52:32.356 --> 01:52:34.416]  Talk about low-energy morons.
[01:52:34.976 --> 01:52:45.698]  Like so many of us, my grandparents came from Ireland as teenagers with nothing but hope in their hearts and fire in their bellies.
[01:52:47.339 --> 01:52:52.700]  They built their lives in the promised land of Buffalo, New York!
[01:52:56.224 --> 01:53:00.547]  If you ever want to know what a sketchy looks like, that's it.
[01:53:00.888 --> 01:53:05.291]  Again, she literally wants you in trips in America to forcibly inject you.
[01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:07.473]  Wants to take all your medical rights away.
[01:53:07.593 --> 01:53:09.935]  They're all talking about bringing foreign trips in now.
[01:53:09.975 --> 01:53:10.695]  You can't believe it.
[01:53:10.715 --> 01:53:11.736]  I tell you, it was hard work.
[01:53:12.036 --> 01:53:17.661]  The crew having to come in here and look at these people.
[01:53:17.781 --> 01:53:19.442]  We do have a lot of viewers on X and
[01:53:27.205 --> 01:53:34.690]  A lot of traffic coming in from wars.com, a lot of people watching, and we just have a responsibility to respond to these liars, but I mean, it is painful to watch.
[01:53:35.491 --> 01:53:37.452]  It's like a visual form of nails on a chalkboard.
[01:53:37.492 --> 01:53:44.657]  It's like staring into the abyss of hell and getting a little forte, or a little sample of what an attorney of torture would be like.
[01:53:46.859 --> 01:53:50.462]  Remember, they hired over 10,000 influencers to fill the crowd.
[01:53:50.922 --> 01:53:52.183]  It's literally AstroTurf.
[01:53:53.542 --> 01:53:57.966]  Well, I'm going to put you in a camp and force him to get you!
[01:53:58.326 --> 01:53:59.547]  A felon!
[01:53:59.567 --> 01:53:59.728]  Yeah!
[01:53:59.748 --> 01:54:02.190]  In our rigged courts!
[01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:09.837]  And we tried to kill him and that didn't work either!
[01:54:09.917 --> 01:54:10.557]  Oh yeah!
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:22.660]  Oh yeah!
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:25.181]  These are the people that ramped up inflation.
[01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:27.282]  Yeah, he wants to steal your groceries!
[01:54:27.362 --> 01:54:28.282]  Yeah!
[01:54:28.702 --> 01:54:29.683]  Yeah!
[01:54:30.343 --> 01:54:33.444]  That's why we hired 86,000 Irish agents to harass working poor!
[01:54:33.744 --> 01:54:34.684]  Yeah!
[01:54:34.904 --> 01:54:35.985]  Yeah!
[01:54:36.005 --> 01:54:39.186]  Probably brought in 30 million illegal aliens and a bunch of kids to rape!
[01:54:39.506 --> 01:54:40.366]  Yeah!
[01:54:40.686 --> 01:54:41.666]  Yeah!
[01:54:42.527 --> 01:54:43.787]  For 78 long years!
[01:54:46.909 --> 01:54:47.990]  The fraud!
[01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:49.431]  The tax dodging!
[01:54:49.791 --> 01:54:50.912]  The fraud!
[01:54:51.112 --> 01:54:52.513]  The tax dodging!
[01:54:53.254 --> 01:54:54.395]  The insider trading!
[01:54:54.455 --> 01:54:56.056]  Oh wait, that's the Democrats.
[01:54:56.496 --> 01:54:57.717]  Rip off workers.
[01:54:59.519 --> 01:55:05.683]  He abuses women, brags about it, and then takes away their rights.
[01:55:07.004 --> 01:55:09.086]  And Yorkers are sick of it.
[01:55:09.126 --> 01:55:09.586]  Yorkers?
[01:55:09.646 --> 01:55:10.387]  She can't even talk.
[01:55:10.407 --> 01:55:10.887]  Yorkers.
[01:55:11.047 --> 01:55:13.469]  She ain't looking too good.
[01:55:13.529 --> 01:55:15.391]  Hey honey, take a few more of your little boosters.
[01:55:16.852 --> 01:55:18.972]  Sorry about that, Florida.
[01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:22.033]  Trump hasn't spent much time in New York lately.
[01:55:22.053 --> 01:55:23.553]  In York?
[01:55:23.613 --> 01:55:26.774]  Except, that is, to get convicted of 34 felonies.
[01:55:26.974 --> 01:55:28.054]  Isn't that Northern England?
[01:55:28.974 --> 01:55:31.115]  He didn't even say New York, he said York.
[01:55:33.015 --> 01:55:39.036]  Because New York's motto is excelsior, ever upward or downward.
[01:55:40.156 --> 01:55:43.417]  Because here's what Trump never understood.
[01:55:44.890 --> 01:55:50.357]  America isn't a luxury good to be bought and sold by the privileged and powerful few.
[01:55:50.377 --> 01:55:55.223]  Meanwhile, 95% of corporate donations could go to the Democrats.
[01:55:55.303 --> 01:55:57.566]  The ultra-rich are totally backing them.
[01:55:57.726 --> 01:56:00.710]  And those are the ultra-rich that have consolidated power in monopolies.
[01:56:05.505 --> 01:56:07.525]  You say create real problems to solve?
[01:56:07.625 --> 01:56:09.646]  It can help us tell the truth sometimes.
[01:56:10.866 --> 01:56:11.626]  Look at those teeth.
[01:56:11.646 --> 01:56:14.527]  She can eat an apple through a picket fence.
[01:56:14.547 --> 01:56:17.408]  Pickles right out of the jar.
[01:56:17.448 --> 01:56:19.568]  Did you know they're doing a reboot of Mr. Ed?
[01:56:19.588 --> 01:56:19.628]  No.
[01:56:19.648 --> 01:56:21.228]  Yeah, with her.
[01:56:21.268 --> 01:56:22.209]  A horse is a horse, of course.
[01:56:37.444 --> 01:56:40.046]  To run AI to spy on you taking a pee-pee.
[01:56:51.631 --> 01:56:59.856]  This is all because the jobs are all flooding out of New York because of their policies.
[01:56:59.876 --> 01:57:00.496]  Good paying jobs!
[01:57:00.576 --> 01:57:01.677]  Aren't we running on X spaces?
[01:57:01.697 --> 01:57:01.757]  Yes.
[01:57:12.933 --> 01:57:14.514]  I don't think anybody wants to hear any more of this.
[01:57:14.554 --> 01:57:15.754]  When Hillary the witch comes up.
[01:57:15.794 --> 01:57:17.035]  Well, it's AOC next.
[01:57:17.735 --> 01:57:18.416]  Oh my God.
[01:57:18.916 --> 01:57:21.957]  Talk about Mr. N. I'm going to get his big teeth.
[01:57:22.418 --> 01:57:23.698]  Pickles right out of the jar.
[01:57:25.419 --> 01:57:28.721]  It's more like a old fashioned artillery.
[01:57:28.821 --> 01:57:30.942]  Everybody asks me on the street.
[01:57:31.382 --> 01:57:33.203]  What's old fashioned artillery genius mean?
[01:57:34.693 --> 01:57:35.694]  From Dune, guys.
[01:57:35.974 --> 01:57:37.315]  You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.
[01:57:37.655 --> 01:57:39.576]  You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.
[01:57:39.737 --> 01:57:40.457]  That is slower.
[01:57:40.497 --> 01:57:41.238]  I'm too anxious.
[01:57:41.578 --> 01:57:43.219]  The bargains of the letter.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:45.581]  You wish to join your wife?
[01:57:46.901 --> 01:57:47.742]  So join her.
[01:57:50.604 --> 01:57:51.325]  Oh my gosh.
[01:57:52.325 --> 01:57:57.008]  But again, if you actually read the books, he was a good guy compared to what the... The Baron was?
[01:57:57.028 --> 01:57:58.229]  Yeah, Jihad became, yeah.
[01:57:58.530 --> 01:58:00.231]  Yeah, he was good compared to his nephew.
[01:58:01.055 --> 01:58:05.257]  Well, no, that's why he doesn't want to follow the vision, but he's also vengeful and wants to beat him.
[01:58:05.297 --> 01:58:06.678]  So he goes, all right, I'll be super evil.
[01:58:07.018 --> 01:58:09.579]  Fine, fine, paradise, go murder 50 million people.
[01:58:10.159 --> 01:58:10.419]  Wow.
[01:58:10.439 --> 01:58:11.720]  That's the actual... Sounds familiar.
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:13.801]  Yeah.
[01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:16.102]  Well, no, it's very archetypal.
[01:58:16.442 --> 01:58:17.703]  The first book's very sophisticated.
[01:58:17.763 --> 01:58:19.664]  He was making money out of the next ones.
[01:58:19.884 --> 01:58:20.724]  They get progressively worse.
[01:58:20.784 --> 01:58:22.645]  I read like all seven of them or whatever when I was younger.
[01:58:22.825 --> 01:58:23.005]  Yeah.
[01:58:23.826 --> 01:58:24.826]  But I read Doom like three times.
[01:58:25.026 --> 01:58:26.507]  So it's very archetypally powerful.
[01:58:26.527 --> 01:58:28.008]  It's a knowledge of history and...
[01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:30.991]  You know, kind of integrating our secret societies work.
[01:58:31.031 --> 01:58:32.733]  But, uh, well, no, no.
[01:58:32.773 --> 01:58:39.982]  I mean, then, uh, Duke, uh, Leto's son, Paltrow, he's just, you know, really depressed about it and basically just goes out in the desert and lets a worm eat him.
[01:58:40.002 --> 01:58:46.870]  He's so upset that his son, you know, Leto, you know, the third or whatever, takes over, kind of embraces the whole plan.
[01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:53.775]  Uh, and then they had to create all this genocide throughout the universe, or the universe will actually burn out that you can see into the future.
[01:58:54.135 --> 01:58:56.357]  So it's like kind of like the Foundation series, like Isaac Asimov.
[01:58:56.377 --> 01:58:57.457]  Like a sacrificial necessity.
[01:58:57.497 --> 01:59:02.120]  They have to depopulate everybody for this one outcome to happen, actually saving man in the end.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.361]  Where have we heard of that before?
[01:59:03.381 --> 01:59:14.268]  It's just that you see the guys with black teeth and shaved heads that are all trying to openly be authoritarian and evil, and then it turns out they were like one one millionth as bad as the good, valiant people.
[01:59:14.628 --> 01:59:22.515]  And actually what that intention would come through, but that shows what it is to take on destiny and total will and to go ahead and carry that out.
[01:59:23.116 --> 01:59:25.918]  So it's ultimately a utilitarian Machiavellian story.
[01:59:25.938 --> 01:59:27.140]  The end justifies the means.
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:30.643]  You allow this injustice to happen on a massive scale if it means saving humanity.
[01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:34.747]  But it's actually says it's bad at the end, but yeah, it's exactly.
[01:59:34.907 --> 01:59:38.670]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's not really an ultra Illuminati type message.
[01:59:39.151 --> 01:59:39.291]  Wow.
[01:59:40.666 --> 01:59:42.067]  Anyways, let's go back to the top.
[01:59:42.107 --> 01:59:45.708]  I mean, look, we have a promo video about America and look how tough she is.
[01:59:45.749 --> 01:59:49.370]  She's been hiding in the basement and can't even give a speech.
[01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:51.831]  Oh, that's going to be funny when she reads out her teleprompter.
[01:59:54.273 --> 01:59:57.314]  It's just like pink suit, blue suit, gray suit, pink suit, blue suit, gray suit.
[02:00:00.376 --> 02:00:02.797]  Can't wait to see Hillary come crawling out of her snake hole.
[02:00:05.053 --> 02:00:07.275]  This is my hometown, Chicago.
[02:00:07.315 --> 02:00:10.298]  Yeah, where her father was the number two mob boss under Daley.
[02:00:11.179 --> 02:00:14.502]  Anybody who's lived in Chicago for more than one generation is in the mobbers connected.
[02:00:15.763 --> 02:00:16.644]  I grew up in Illinois, man.
[02:00:16.684 --> 02:00:21.249]  I know everybody in Illinois hates Chicago, except for Chicago, which totally disregards the rest of the state.
[02:00:21.269 --> 02:00:23.631]  It's not even the capital.
[02:00:24.272 --> 02:00:25.673]  They just behave like it.
[02:00:26.634 --> 02:00:27.375]  What is it, Springfield?
[02:00:27.555 --> 02:00:27.715]  Yeah.
[02:00:29.491 --> 02:00:34.693]  Abraham Lincoln's buried in Springfield in a dilapidated grave with burned out light bulbs and overgrown shrubs.
[02:00:35.153 --> 02:00:35.494]  Really?
[02:00:35.714 --> 02:00:37.254]  Yeah, it's screwed up.
[02:00:43.397 --> 02:00:46.738]  Well, yeah, Chicago is still the number one drug hub in the country.
[02:00:46.878 --> 02:00:47.959]  And human trafficking capital.
[02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:48.379]  Yep.
[02:00:49.719 --> 02:00:50.740]  All roads lead to Chicago.
[02:00:54.822 --> 02:00:56.722]  I don't think she was on the list of speaking tonight.
[02:00:56.762 --> 02:00:57.843]  This is like a surprise thing.
[02:00:59.136 --> 02:01:00.777]  No, I told everybody this morning.
[02:01:00.817 --> 02:01:03.097]  I said it says she's doing a surprise visit.
[02:01:03.137 --> 02:01:04.618]  She comes out dressed as a brown shirt.
[02:01:05.318 --> 02:01:08.479]  Yep, she's in a Herriman, no, a Yinced Rome outfit.
[02:01:08.659 --> 02:01:09.240]  Hugo Boss!
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:10.720]  There we go.
[02:01:12.241 --> 02:01:14.482]  Alright, they're getting the, oh, I wonder if she's going to cackle.
[02:01:15.282 --> 02:01:16.182]  Oh, she's already cackling, yeah.
[02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.583]  Good evening, everyone!
[02:01:17.623 --> 02:01:18.763]  They all act excited.
[02:01:20.184 --> 02:01:21.084]  Oh, she's cackling!
[02:01:21.144 --> 02:01:22.845]  She knows to pull the mic away when she cackles.
[02:01:24.165 --> 02:01:26.306]  Good evening, good evening!
[02:01:27.427 --> 02:01:34.455]  It is so good to be with everyone this evening, in this hall, and everyone at home.
[02:01:34.475 --> 02:01:39.160]  I gotta say, her entrance, though, in that room, that black smoke coming out the back, or green smoke.
[02:01:40.081 --> 02:01:44.166]  I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog!
[02:01:44.186 --> 02:01:44.406]  Fly!
[02:01:44.526 --> 02:01:44.967]  Fly!
[02:01:45.007 --> 02:01:45.507]  Bring them to me!
[02:01:51.912 --> 02:01:54.354]  Who will be speaking later tonight.
[02:01:54.814 --> 02:02:03.660]  Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you will continue to do.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.282]  We are forever grateful to you.
[02:02:09.584 --> 02:02:12.626]  That's why we gave you a medical emergency and drugged you up for eight days.
[02:02:14.387 --> 02:02:15.548]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:02:15.568 --> 02:02:17.710]  Look at the satanic power trip she's on.
[02:02:21.448 --> 02:02:23.109]  We're about to steal this election.
[02:02:23.650 --> 02:02:30.535]  This morning I told you they announced that she wasn't on the list.
[02:02:30.555 --> 02:02:32.957]  But she said Kamala will speak tonight.
[02:02:32.977 --> 02:02:34.277]  I'm surprised it isn't.
[02:02:34.298 --> 02:02:36.099]  I said her name right.
[02:02:36.319 --> 02:02:36.599]  Kamala.
[02:02:36.619 --> 02:02:38.200]  I almost said it wrong.
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.161]  I said Kamala.
[02:02:39.221 --> 02:02:40.682]  I almost said Kamala.
[02:02:40.702 --> 02:02:41.843]  Kamalady or Kamalacost.
[02:02:41.863 --> 02:02:43.364]  Kamalacost.
[02:02:43.644 --> 02:02:44.225]  Kamalaism.
[02:02:55.085 --> 02:02:55.727]  And look at the crowd.
[02:02:55.767 --> 02:02:57.171]  It's a giant group of politicos.
[02:02:58.718 --> 02:03:00.319]  Oh my God, she can barely talk!
[02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:02.339]  She just popped out for like an eel coming out of its hole.
[02:03:02.399 --> 02:03:02.900]  A moray eel.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:32.981]  Big Mike's the fake woman.
[02:03:33.902 --> 02:03:35.203]  She's the fake black lady.
[02:03:37.945 --> 02:03:39.146]  Biden was the fake president.
[02:03:42.168 --> 02:03:43.229]  Look, they're all trying to get inside.
[02:03:43.309 --> 02:03:44.930]  Yeah, this is badass!
[02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:46.592]  She walked out dark for 30 seconds.
[02:03:47.752 --> 02:03:48.713]  That was incredible!
[02:03:49.694 --> 02:03:50.475]  Amazing!
[02:03:50.675 --> 02:03:54.598]  Please welcome actor and director Tony Goldwyn.
[02:03:55.038 --> 02:03:56.499]  Wow!
[02:03:56.699 --> 02:03:58.421]  Tony Goldwyn!
[02:03:59.542 --> 02:04:00.643]  Wow!
[02:04:03.444 --> 02:04:04.884]  They all look like they've been electrocuted.
[02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:09.945]  And hello to everyone tuning in from all across America.
[02:04:11.186 --> 02:04:16.267]  Welcome to the first night of the Democratic National Convention.
[02:04:16.727 --> 02:04:19.507]  Now, how was that for an opening act?
[02:04:19.707 --> 02:04:21.568]  Wow, it was like watching paint dry.
[02:04:21.988 --> 02:04:22.468]  Wow!
[02:04:22.528 --> 02:04:24.028]  I'm just saying.
[02:04:24.888 --> 02:04:27.189]  Now, as our Vice President just said,
[02:04:28.277 --> 02:04:43.146]  Over the next four days, we will be bringing folks together from all around the country, people from every walk of life, to talk about this nation we love, and about a candidate who has devoted her life- Folks, we got some footage of Hillary arriving.
[02:04:43.406 --> 02:04:50.170]  She's talking to some of the kids outside where she goes in.
[02:04:52.011 --> 02:04:55.653]  We are going to talk about the choice America faces in this election.
[02:04:56.704 --> 02:05:03.069]  It's a choice not just between two very different candidates, but between two very different futures.
[02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:08.653]  We will hear from everyday Americans about what is truly at stake in this campaign.
[02:05:08.673 --> 02:05:10.134]  You give me those Nickelback launch codes.
[02:05:10.815 --> 02:05:25.166]  The future of our middle class, the future of reproductive rights, the future of our climate, our security, our schools, the future of our freedom, the future
[02:05:26.047 --> 02:05:26.887]  Hillary's next, right?
[02:05:26.907 --> 02:05:27.888]  Unless they changed it.
[02:05:28.228 --> 02:05:28.948]  It's like offering Gavin Newsom.
[02:05:28.968 --> 02:05:32.689]  And if you believe that, believe this actor, who's reading out a teleprompter, and she's not a border czar,
[02:05:54.221 --> 02:06:12.356]  Instead of scoffing at allies and fawning over dictators, our president stands up for our friends, faces down our adversaries, and American democracy remains a beacon of hope and inspires the world to take on our biggest challenges together.
[02:06:13.517 --> 02:06:23.765]  We'll learn the story of a leader who has dedicated her life to doing the work of making good on the promise of America.
[02:06:24.682 --> 02:06:28.064]  Look, no matter what they do, even if they try to steal this election, in the end they're done.
[02:06:28.084 --> 02:06:30.365]  These people are a joke.
[02:06:30.385 --> 02:06:35.348]  I love every time they try to go to a grocery store or a gas station, they act all weird.
[02:06:35.388 --> 02:06:36.149]  Look, I've got my Doritos.
[02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.769]  Oh, I'm a normal person.
[02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:37.209]  Kamala Harris!
[02:06:53.809 --> 02:06:56.692]  Because she has a message for us.
[02:06:57.313 --> 02:07:00.917]  It is a message that's joyful, not mean-spirited.
[02:07:01.457 --> 02:07:04.160]  A message of public service, not self-service.
[02:07:04.361 --> 02:07:09.626]  A message of optimism and opportunity, not chaos and division.
[02:07:09.686 --> 02:07:12.549]  A message that has woken us up to who we are.
[02:07:15.444 --> 02:07:20.587]  Throw up a B-roll of Clip 27 just so people can see what's happening outside today.
[02:07:20.607 --> 02:07:20.988]  Yeah, Clip 27.
[02:07:21.048 --> 02:07:21.388]  A bunch of it.
[02:07:21.408 --> 02:07:22.048]  We are not small-minded.
[02:07:22.068 --> 02:07:22.869]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:07:22.889 --> 02:07:23.970]  As big as Big Mike's ding-a-ling.
[02:07:41.025 --> 02:07:41.325]  Yeah!
[02:07:41.365 --> 02:07:42.005]  Yeah!
[02:07:42.745 --> 02:07:43.746]  We're good.
[02:07:43.966 --> 02:07:44.706]  Are you ready?
[02:07:45.226 --> 02:07:45.786]  Are you ready?
[02:07:46.506 --> 02:07:46.886]  Okay.
[02:07:46.946 --> 02:07:47.106]  Okay.
[02:07:47.827 --> 02:07:53.448]  Well, I challenge you to make this the moment you get off the sidelines and into the game.
[02:07:54.508 --> 02:08:00.269]  So I want you to text JOIN to 30330 and get involved.
[02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:02.290]  Because when we fight, what happens?
[02:08:04.848 --> 02:08:07.131]  And we are going to win this thing together.
[02:08:07.972 --> 02:08:10.594]  And while we're doing it, we're going to have a whole lot of fun.
[02:08:10.634 --> 02:08:11.695]  So let's get started.
[02:08:21.151 --> 02:08:23.352]  Showing Michael Jordan clips now because it's Chicago.
[02:08:25.573 --> 02:08:35.296]  Please welcome nine-time NBA champion and coach of the 2024 Olympic gold-winning men's basketball team, Steve Kerr.
[02:08:36.537 --> 02:08:36.897]  Thank you.
[02:08:36.977 --> 02:08:42.599]  Yeah, this is so exciting.
[02:08:43.279 --> 02:08:44.180]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:50.082]  We don't want to go back and then they show the 90s clip of the Bulls.
[02:08:54.503 --> 02:08:59.250]  It is so fun to be back here in the United Center.
[02:09:00.352 --> 02:09:03.938]  And as you guys know, a lot of good stuff has happened in this building.
[02:09:05.961 --> 02:09:06.762]  Especially in the 90s.
[02:09:09.485 --> 02:09:13.668]  You young people, Google Michael Jordan and you can read all about it.
[02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:19.973]  So there was an amazing vibe in this building back in the days.
[02:09:19.993 --> 02:09:21.294]  They're trying to tie themselves to Michael Jordan.
[02:09:21.334 --> 02:09:24.456]  I feel that same winning spirit here tonight.
[02:09:25.737 --> 02:09:27.278]  I don't think you can button the top button of a shirt.
[02:09:27.478 --> 02:09:32.362]  So the last time I was in a packed basketball arena was in Paris, France.
[02:09:33.928 --> 02:09:35.329]  And they had burning buildings and seas of feces.
[02:09:35.349 --> 02:09:35.729]  Man, this is cheesy.
[02:09:35.749 --> 02:09:36.370]  Guys, cut the whole thing.
[02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:37.650]  Turn the shirt off, please.
[02:09:37.710 --> 02:09:38.171]  At the, uh, RNC.
[02:09:38.191 --> 02:09:38.491]  I love you.
[02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:07.669]  And I cannot think of a better metaphor for what this country is all about than the way Team USA came together at the Olympics.
[02:10:08.249 --> 02:10:10.730]  We had players from across our wonderful country.
[02:10:11.431 --> 02:10:21.916]  Players who have trained and fought relentlessly, shed tears trying to beat one another throughout their careers, joining forces to wear the red, white, and blue.
[02:10:22.076 --> 02:10:23.377]  And when we won,
[02:10:23.997 --> 02:10:33.559]  The American flag raised to the rafters, the national anthem playing, gold medals draped around the necks of our players, whose hands were held over their hearts.
[02:10:34.499 --> 02:10:36.740]  It was the proudest moment of my life.
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:45.082]  Thank you.
[02:10:45.102 --> 02:10:45.482]  Thank you.
[02:10:47.185 --> 02:10:55.713]  Now I could never have imagined that a few days later I would receive an invitation to step into a different kind of arena.
[02:10:56.613 --> 02:10:57.554]  And so here I am.
[02:10:59.496 --> 02:11:05.922]  I know, I know very well that speaking out about politics these days comes with risks.
[02:11:06.902 --> 02:11:09.785]  I can see the shut up and whistle tweets being fired off.
[02:11:09.805 --> 02:11:11.126]  I see all the real Americans.
[02:11:12.167 --> 02:11:13.028]  I think about
[02:11:14.383 --> 02:11:18.125]  How Donald Trump, his family was compromised.
[02:11:19.086 --> 02:11:25.330]  When I look out there and I see Donald Trump, I think about how his business was compromised.
[02:11:27.111 --> 02:11:32.615]  But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero?
[02:11:36.137 --> 02:11:40.780]  And they tried to kill the next President of the United States.
[02:11:42.114 --> 02:11:44.275]  Enough was enough!
[02:11:44.996 --> 02:11:49.538]  And I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother!
[02:11:49.898 --> 02:11:52.300]  Let Trumpamania rule again!
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.542]  Let Trumpamania make America great again!
[02:11:56.742 --> 02:12:06.147]  I mean, if they want to pull the sports thing or the entertainment thing, we can trump them.
[02:12:06.387 --> 02:12:06.587]  Yeah.
[02:12:07.068 --> 02:12:07.728]  No pun intended.
[02:12:07.748 --> 02:12:09.089]  Let's go back to this guy.
[02:12:09.469 --> 02:12:11.290]  Again, that's like drying paint.
[02:12:13.633 --> 02:12:21.016]  I believe leaders must possess knowledge and expertise, but with the full awareness that none of us has all the answers.
[02:12:21.656 --> 02:12:23.737]  Oh, Kamala really possesses a lot of knowledge.
[02:12:23.757 --> 02:12:27.299]  And in fact, some of the best answers often come from members of the team.
[02:12:29.299 --> 02:12:40.924]  And if you look for those qualities in your friends, or your boss, or an employee, or your child's teacher, or your mayor, then shouldn't you want those same qualities in your president?
[02:12:41.923 --> 02:12:42.623]  Or your hemorrhoids.
[02:12:44.764 --> 02:12:47.825]  And when you think about it that way, this is no contest.
[02:12:47.845 --> 02:12:50.086]  I'm gonna start calling Kamala the human hemorrhoid.
[02:12:50.106 --> 02:12:52.707]  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, I see all those qualities.
[02:12:53.567 --> 02:12:55.708]  They have devoted their lives to serving other people.
[02:12:55.728 --> 02:12:57.749]  They can cross a hemorrhoid with a hyena?
[02:12:57.869 --> 02:13:00.650]  Yeah, when she goes down, she just won't go back up.
[02:13:01.730 --> 02:13:05.232]  Or Governor Walz was inspiring the next generation in the classroom.
[02:13:06.272 --> 02:13:08.213]  Or on the field, for that matter.
[02:13:08.473 --> 02:13:11.134]  By the way, coach to coach, that guy's awesome.
[02:13:12.105 --> 02:13:16.527]  Oh, this is the most fake, cringe, canned... Coach to coach.
[02:13:16.547 --> 02:13:17.107]  See, this is the thing.
[02:13:17.127 --> 02:13:20.709]  They're bringing out coaches because they're trying to brand Wallace as the coach.
[02:13:20.749 --> 02:13:25.310]  Oh, I remember a few weeks ago, Alexander Soros, like, just faced me and goes, This guy's a coach!
[02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:26.831]  Americans respect the coach!
[02:13:26.851 --> 02:13:27.531]  We're gonna win!
[02:13:27.551 --> 02:13:27.771]  A coach!
[02:13:30.023 --> 02:13:30.844]  Yeah.
[02:13:30.904 --> 02:13:32.485]  Walt's isn't a common Chinese agent.
[02:13:32.725 --> 02:13:40.070]  He's a guy that wants to put tampons in boys' bathrooms or that shot people, had the police shoot people on their porches during COVID for being outside.
[02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:41.230]  He's just a coach.
[02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:42.051]  With paintballs.
[02:13:42.491 --> 02:13:43.072]  No, no, no.
[02:13:43.152 --> 02:13:49.095]  He's just a good old coach that does support rioting and burning, you know, half of Minnesota down.
[02:13:49.115 --> 02:13:51.477]  Oh, there he is.
[02:13:51.497 --> 02:13:52.718]  He named his dog Scout.
[02:13:56.832 --> 02:13:58.354]  Oh, but he's in the newspaper articles.
[02:13:58.394 --> 02:13:59.255]  Now we have them all.
[02:13:59.836 --> 02:14:00.697]  I've got him right here.
[02:14:01.758 --> 02:14:03.060]  Let's overhead shot on this.
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:03.520]  Um.
[02:14:04.782 --> 02:14:08.606]  Waltz praised Communist Chinese system where everyone shares here.
[02:14:08.626 --> 02:14:09.647]  I've got more of these right here.
[02:14:09.667 --> 02:14:10.969]  I don't know if you saw that call.
[02:14:10.989 --> 02:14:13.312]  He actually got the news articles overhead shot place.
[02:14:15.097 --> 02:14:15.477]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:15.738 --> 02:14:17.820]  Well, I don't know if you saw the caller that called in a couple of weeks ago.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.124]  Sunday night, 23 minutes, this guy went to China with Walls in 1995.
[02:14:21.505 --> 02:14:27.813]  We probably had one of the—well, they all said this, and now the students said it, and then now they've released.
[02:14:28.413 --> 02:14:33.380]  He'll basically live there, and it's all about Mao's good, communism's good, we need to be communist.
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.120]  And they have the news articles.
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:43.683]  He thinks that communism brought China from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, and totally disregards the fact that it only worked for them because they adopted capitalism to some extent.
[02:14:43.963 --> 02:14:53.266]  Well, in the great leap forward, the Cultural Revolution, they killed 80 million people, and then they removed Mao in the late 70s, and they made a deal with the West to bring industry in.
[02:14:53.506 --> 02:14:54.647]  Yes.
[02:14:54.727 --> 02:14:56.127]  Total was a total disaster.
[02:14:56.907 --> 02:14:58.008]  But let's go back to this idiot.
[02:14:58.028 --> 02:15:01.449]  The next president and vice president of the United States.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:20.964]  And, and, after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump, night-night!
[02:15:22.444 --> 02:15:23.845]  Oh, night-night?
[02:15:23.865 --> 02:15:25.505]  They tell everyone they're three years old.
[02:15:27.466 --> 02:15:28.246]  Night-night?
[02:15:28.266 --> 02:15:28.846]  Is that a threat?
[02:15:29.386 --> 02:15:31.667]  Well, they tried to night-night him, you know, on July 13th.
[02:15:34.952 --> 02:15:40.099]  And they go, listen... We tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don't sell your house.
[02:15:40.399 --> 02:15:41.120]  Do not sell it.
[02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:45.525]  We're going to get those jobs coming back and we're going to fill up those factories.
[02:15:45.545 --> 02:15:46.206]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:15:47.047 --> 02:15:48.549]  And it was happening until they launched COVID.
[02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:49.831]  But Trump lied.
[02:15:58.265 --> 02:16:04.788]  Sure, he owned more factories than that in the last 60 years.
[02:16:05.509 --> 02:16:17.976]  And sure, he got the energy prices down by half, but, you know, and sure, he shut the border down, and well, sure, he created world peace, there was no big wars, but, but yeah, he, he, he, he, he, you know, well, one factory he tried to save, he wasn't able to.
[02:16:17.996 --> 02:16:18.717]  So, so, so,
[02:16:19.957 --> 02:16:21.678]  Then something changed.
[02:16:21.918 --> 02:16:22.898]  Then something changed.
[02:16:23.559 --> 02:16:28.761]  Instead of lies and broken promises, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris got the work and brought U.S.
[02:16:28.801 --> 02:16:31.942]  manufacturing jobs back, including to Lordstown.
[02:16:32.482 --> 02:16:35.623]  Kamala will continue to have workers' backs and get the job done.
[02:16:36.103 --> 02:16:39.725]  American workers deserve a fighter, and that's exactly what Kamala Harris is.
[02:16:39.765 --> 02:16:41.465]  Do we believe in opportunity?
[02:16:41.625 --> 02:16:43.966]  Are we ready to fight for it?
[02:16:44.146 --> 02:16:47.968]  Yeah, folks, you want a good economy, Jimmy Carter, Joe Biden,
[02:16:50.765 --> 02:16:52.205]  If this is a good economy, I want a battle.
[02:16:52.245 --> 02:16:55.626]  He's helping move jobs to Mexico.
[02:16:55.766 --> 02:17:00.708]  But that's okay.
[02:17:00.728 --> 02:17:08.090]  When Trump threatened to shut him down with 100% tariff, he said he was racist.
[02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:11.051]  Is he going to rip off his jacket?
[02:17:12.151 --> 02:17:12.711]  And pull proven?
[02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:15.652]  Too bad this guy's building a...
[02:17:17.461 --> 02:17:30.045]  Cars, you get a jacket that fits.
[02:17:30.085 --> 02:17:30.765]  Thank you.
[02:17:30.785 --> 02:17:32.006]  Thank you.
[02:17:32.986 --> 02:17:33.766]  Thank you.
[02:17:33.786 --> 02:17:40.108]  Good evening, America, and good evening to the people that make this world move, the working class.
[02:17:41.008 --> 02:17:45.670]  That Kamala and Biden are 86,000 RSAs to specifically assault.
[02:17:46.326 --> 02:17:59.432]  On behalf of one million active and retired members of the UAW, I am honored to support Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to be our next president and vice president.
[02:18:00.112 --> 02:18:03.934]  And dammit, they're both Chinese Communist agents, so we're going to F this country over.
[02:18:03.974 --> 02:18:05.295]  How do you dumbasses like that?
[02:18:06.755 --> 02:18:14.279]  And I want to say thank you to Joe Biden for making history by walking the picket line with the UAW.
[02:18:16.078 --> 02:18:16.618]  Back in 1940.
[02:18:16.858 --> 02:18:22.520]  I think I remember they removed Biden.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.761]  And stalled Kamala.
[02:18:26.941 --> 02:18:29.522]  This election comes down to one question.
[02:18:30.962 --> 02:18:32.783]  Which side are you on?
[02:18:33.183 --> 02:18:34.963]  The side of the Chi-Coms, the new order?
[02:18:36.644 --> 02:18:40.605]  On one side, we have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[02:18:40.665 --> 02:18:41.385]  And the pedophiles.
[02:18:41.465 --> 02:18:44.766]  Who have stood shoulder to shoulder with the working class.
[02:18:46.209 --> 02:18:46.449]  Uh-huh.
[02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:50.053]  That's why... I think like 95% of the money?
[02:18:50.093 --> 02:18:50.614]  Well, look it up.
[02:19:05.626 --> 02:19:08.608]  95% of the billionaires are supporting them, and it's a total crap.
[02:19:08.968 --> 02:19:17.533]  I mean, the establishment does not like... And it's true that 30 years ago, Democrats still had more corporate money, but Republicans were a close second.
[02:19:18.053 --> 02:19:19.554]  Folks, Trump doesn't get anything.
[02:19:19.754 --> 02:19:19.954]  Right.
[02:19:21.816 --> 02:19:25.138]  There's like 2,000, I think, 1,000 to 2,000 billionaires in the United States.
[02:19:25.158 --> 02:19:27.759]  The only one I can think of who's supporting Donald Trump is Elon Musk.
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:30.801]  There's like six of them.
[02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:32.462]  Only six billionaires?
[02:19:33.032 --> 02:19:34.072]  No, yeah, they're supporting Trump.
[02:19:34.092 --> 02:19:34.332]  I don't know.
[02:19:34.352 --> 02:19:35.313]  I mean, I've seen articles about it.
[02:19:35.353 --> 02:19:35.653]  It's like 1%.
[02:19:35.893 --> 02:19:41.154]  Yeah, yeah, but I saw the numbers and guys can search engine it.
[02:19:41.774 --> 02:19:46.715]  I think it's a headlines of 95% of major corporate donations going Democratic Party.
[02:19:49.196 --> 02:19:53.637]  But in the presidential race, you know that they do give the Senate and some house races are still.
[02:19:54.918 --> 02:19:56.038]  Way over to the Democrats.
[02:19:56.932 --> 02:20:01.035]  So again, that's why they got him wearing a suit that's too big and a red shirt to make him look provincial.
[02:20:01.055 --> 02:20:01.815]  Right.
[02:20:01.855 --> 02:20:03.096]  And look like a regular guy.
[02:20:03.577 --> 02:20:05.978]  That UAW boy, they're not corrupt at all.
[02:20:05.998 --> 02:20:06.819]  They're good people.
[02:20:07.519 --> 02:20:10.261]  They didn't ship your jobs to China and Mexico and everywhere else.
[02:20:10.361 --> 02:20:10.701]  No!
[02:20:11.562 --> 02:20:12.923]  Donald Trump did that.
[02:20:13.003 --> 02:20:14.564]  We're gonna do something about that.
[02:20:14.604 --> 02:20:15.264]  Let's go back to him.
[02:20:18.166 --> 02:20:20.228]  Trump did nothing!
[02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:24.871]  Trump told workers in Lordstown, Ohio
[02:20:26.229 --> 02:20:27.650]  Another lie.
[02:20:30.292 --> 02:20:39.179]  Trump did get suckered into the COVID lockdowns when he tried to shut them down.
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:40.881]  Biden tried to keep them going.
[02:20:40.921 --> 02:20:41.841]  That's what shut things down.
[02:20:41.861 --> 02:20:42.402]  Oh, yeah.
[02:20:56.508 --> 02:21:01.271]  You know who was on the picket line standing shoulder to shoulder with autoworkers?
[02:21:04.173 --> 02:21:05.334]  I'll give you a clue.
[02:21:05.554 --> 02:21:07.996]  Her initials are Kamala Harris.
[02:21:09.417 --> 02:21:12.579]  Her initials are Kamala Harris.
[02:21:12.779 --> 02:21:13.780]  All right.
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:18.423]  In 2023, who helped bring jobs back to Lordstown, Ohio?
[02:21:19.464 --> 02:21:20.724]  Kamala Harris!
[02:21:22.626 --> 02:21:22.986]  I don't know.
[02:21:23.729 --> 02:21:25.830]  I said we'd cover this all week long.
[02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:27.530]  I don't know if I can do this to everybody.
[02:21:27.570 --> 02:21:28.311]  Well, we gotta do it.
[02:21:28.331 --> 02:21:28.791]  Oh, please.
[02:21:28.851 --> 02:21:29.891]  I'm actually in hell right now.
[02:21:29.911 --> 02:21:33.072]  Yeah, went to the border for 30 minutes one time.
[02:21:33.793 --> 02:21:35.053]  Hal says she wasn't the borders are.
[02:21:53.917 --> 02:21:54.978]  It's getting hot in here!
[02:21:55.638 --> 02:21:56.980]  Oh wait, he's Hulk Hogan-ing it!
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:58.901]  He took his jacket off!
[02:21:59.922 --> 02:22:01.723]  I called it right when he walked out, man.
[02:22:02.124 --> 02:22:08.169]  Why would you wear a t-shirt under a jacket if you couldn't show what it said?
[02:22:11.571 --> 02:22:13.613]  You know Harris is the only one who's been picking for scabs.
[02:22:17.316 --> 02:22:18.357]  It's hot in here!
[02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:27.415]  It's hot in here because you're fired up and you're fed up and the American working class is fired up and fed up.
[02:22:27.615 --> 02:22:31.098]  And now he's acting like, I did that because it's hot.
[02:22:31.138 --> 02:22:34.140]  That wasn't staged or anything.
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:47.009]  And if you don't believe me, just last night, blue collar workers, the UAW members at Cornell University had to walk out on strike for a better life because they're fighting corporate greed.
[02:22:49.235 --> 02:23:04.849]  Bill Clinton's the one that really shipped everything to China and these idiots love it.
[02:23:05.250 --> 02:23:08.933]  Now I'm saying this kind of tongue-in-cheek because Trump said it too.
[02:23:08.973 --> 02:23:11.215]  Go ahead and fade this guy down for a minute.
[02:23:11.255 --> 02:23:13.758]  Remember Trump two weeks ago on Truth Social said...
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:20.184]  Yeah, he said that he was forced out on that CBS interview and a bunch of others, and then he's been saying.
[02:23:37.352 --> 02:23:38.072]  And all the rest of it.
[02:23:38.092 --> 02:23:38.512]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:38.592 --> 02:23:39.373]  My throat clears.
[02:23:39.553 --> 02:23:45.354]  Yeah, well, I mean, I saw the interviews where this week he literally came out and admitted that he was forced out.
[02:23:45.394 --> 02:23:48.455]  Nancy Pelosi simultaneously admitting in interviews that she forced him out.
[02:23:48.495 --> 02:23:50.016]  He seems disgruntled about it.
[02:23:50.156 --> 02:23:53.037]  She said it didn't look like his signature and it didn't look like his writing.
[02:23:53.417 --> 02:23:54.617]  It didn't even have letterhead, remember?
[02:23:55.057 --> 02:23:57.938]  And they admit he had a medical emergency and they just removed him.
[02:23:57.978 --> 02:23:58.799]  It's all illegal.
[02:23:59.039 --> 02:24:00.019]  They go, Trump's crazy.
[02:24:00.039 --> 02:24:00.999]  He's claiming this is a coup.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:06.281]  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz got absolutely zero votes in the primary.
[02:24:07.912 --> 02:24:09.554]  That's as many as Ronald McDonald, thank you.
[02:24:09.574 --> 02:24:13.678]  Well, they did the same thing in the 2016 primary, where they just totally stole it from Bernie.
[02:24:14.198 --> 02:24:19.283]  Bernie ended up endorsing Hillary, just in exchange for her changing her health care policy to be more Bernie-esque.
[02:24:19.363 --> 02:24:24.489]  And we interviewed a Superdome, and he goes, Bernie will get some, but we don't care what the voters do.
[02:24:24.529 --> 02:24:25.690]  We're just going to vote for Hillary.
[02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:26.230]  Yep.
[02:24:26.890 --> 02:24:29.411]  So this is not the first time they've stolen a primary from their voters.
[02:24:29.691 --> 02:24:30.471]  And it's getting worse.
[02:24:30.551 --> 02:24:45.554]  Now you have this staged, quasi-virtual thing where they admittedly only brought in politicos, controlled media, and social influencers and paid them all between $10,000 is the lowest and $100,000 to be there.
[02:24:45.894 --> 02:24:50.855]  So you have a fawning group of people to yell and scream like trained seals being fed fish.
[02:24:54.002 --> 02:24:55.203]  You want to hear more of this guy, folks?
[02:24:55.283 --> 02:25:00.207]  I mean, again, people tuning in wanting to hear the same stuff repeated over and over again.
[02:25:00.767 --> 02:25:02.869]  I'm sure you can find this feed somewhere.
[02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:11.515]  What do you want to bet the media tries to spin this chase and claim that this has more viewers than Trump's event?
[02:25:12.216 --> 02:25:16.039]  Remember Elon Musk last Monday had over a billion views.
[02:25:16.159 --> 02:25:19.842]  And I think when something's that big, him and Trump should have done another one by now.
[02:25:20.325 --> 02:25:24.047]  Yeah, well, obviously Trump should be much more active on X than he has been, but I agree with you.
[02:25:24.067 --> 02:25:38.074]  What they're going to do is they're going to add up all the BS numbers from the Nielsen ratings, which keep in mind, when CNN or MSNBC or any of these major networks report the number of viewers that they have, they're counting anyone who tuned in for at least 60 seconds.
[02:25:38.435 --> 02:25:42.977]  And that includes all the people that they estimate went through LaGuardia while it was on TV in the terminal.
[02:25:43.097 --> 02:25:43.817]  So I have a question for you.
[02:26:10.177 --> 02:26:17.063]  Are you ready to stand up, speak up, and show up and put Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the White House?
[02:26:17.103 --> 02:26:18.884]  Can you imagine when AOC gets out there?
[02:26:20.706 --> 02:26:21.566]  In an aggravating suit?
[02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:23.668]  Doesn't it look like she's lit up like a Christmas tree?
[02:26:24.949 --> 02:26:27.811]  We need a defender of the working class in the White House.
[02:26:27.831 --> 02:26:28.352]  I'm guessing pink suit.
[02:26:28.372 --> 02:26:28.772]  Pink pants suit.
[02:26:28.792 --> 02:26:30.393]  Someone who is one of us.
[02:26:30.433 --> 02:26:31.955]  Maybe like a cream, like a salmon color.
[02:26:31.975 --> 02:26:32.975]  And someone who knows how to fight.
[02:26:33.896 --> 02:26:39.521]  And that fighter is the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris!
[02:26:41.109 --> 02:26:42.589]  Think she's going to be president before November 5th?
[02:26:42.609 --> 02:26:45.090]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.990]  She basically already is.
[02:26:47.511 --> 02:26:49.051]  But now he will send it last week.
[02:26:49.351 --> 02:26:50.031]  It's already happened.
[02:26:50.091 --> 02:26:52.872]  What if Joe Biden resigns as president tonight when he speaks?
[02:26:53.732 --> 02:26:55.252]  That is a really smart point.
[02:26:55.332 --> 02:26:58.333]  You know, he could either... They keep saying he's going to pass the floor.
[02:26:58.393 --> 02:26:58.793]  Oh, it's her.
[02:26:58.853 --> 02:26:59.193]  It's her.
[02:27:01.834 --> 02:27:02.414]  Oh, black!
[02:27:17.361 --> 02:27:18.541]  Hey guys, pull up the video.
[02:27:19.542 --> 02:27:24.863]  When she said, she goes, we don't need to be... She has a fake Hispanic accent more than what a regular accent is.
[02:27:24.883 --> 02:27:27.384]  She goes, we don't need to be growing cauliflower.
[02:27:27.424 --> 02:27:28.024]  It is white.
[02:27:28.104 --> 02:27:28.785]  It is racist.
[02:27:29.885 --> 02:27:31.546]  Remember, cauliflower is from Africa.
[02:27:32.926 --> 02:27:35.367]  But she literally equates something white with being bad.
[02:27:37.087 --> 02:27:39.228]  Look, the stars by my feet are white.
[02:27:40.949 --> 02:27:41.589]  It is bad.
[02:27:43.223 --> 02:27:45.165]  Thank you, Chicago, for your energy.
[02:27:45.205 --> 02:27:50.051]  Thank you, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, for your vision.
[02:27:50.071 --> 02:27:51.452]  I'll say this, though.
[02:27:51.472 --> 02:27:53.875]  She's a lot smarter than Kamala.
[02:27:54.175 --> 02:27:55.517]  Not to be underestimated.
[02:27:55.537 --> 02:28:00.963]  I mean, she's super stupid, but I mean, she's gotten a little better in the years she's been in Congress, having to talk a little bit.
[02:28:03.533 --> 02:28:04.953]  Camelhead or whatever her name is.
[02:28:05.093 --> 02:28:10.456]  Six years ago, I was taking omelet orders as a waitress in New York City.
[02:28:10.636 --> 02:28:11.676]  Oh my god, here we go.
[02:28:11.756 --> 02:28:13.237]  I didn't have health insurance.
[02:28:14.338 --> 02:28:20.921]  My family... Now I'm worth $20 million and wear $10,000 suits and speak out against capitalism.
[02:28:20.941 --> 02:28:25.023]  My dad passed away unexpectedly from cancer.
[02:28:26.743 --> 02:28:32.126]  Like millions of Americans, we were just looking for an honest shake.
[02:28:33.496 --> 02:28:39.588]  And we were tired of a cynical politics that seemed blind... Alright, you want to hear cynical politics?
[02:28:39.648 --> 02:28:40.169]  Fade it down.
[02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:41.431]  I'm not joking.
[02:28:41.672 --> 02:28:43.736]  Here she is saying cauliflower is evil.
[02:28:43.776 --> 02:28:44.137]  Here we go.
[02:28:45.376 --> 02:28:47.157]  That's really how you do it right.
[02:28:47.897 --> 02:28:57.722]  That is such a core component of the Green New Deal is having all of these projects in a cultural context.
[02:28:57.982 --> 02:29:04.986]  And it's an area that I and we get the most pushback on because people say like, why do you need to do that?
[02:29:05.026 --> 02:29:06.027]  That's too hard.
[02:29:06.767 --> 02:29:08.408]  But when you
[02:29:09.730 --> 02:29:24.176]  Really think about it when someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead of, I don't know, cauliflower or something.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:31.323]  What you're doing is that you're taking a colonial approach to environmentalism.
[02:29:32.003 --> 02:29:38.626]  And that is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmental issues.
[02:29:38.646 --> 02:29:47.411]  As if they don't let the minority area gardens that are all over, they have nice ones here in Austin, as if they don't let them plant what they want.
[02:29:48.291 --> 02:29:50.212]  And she just said cauliflower is colonial.
[02:29:50.292 --> 02:29:52.073]  I mean, this is lunatic asylum stuff.
[02:29:52.093 --> 02:29:55.575]  Especially when Karine Jean-Pierre saw this video, it was the closest she ever came to changing her haircut.
[02:29:55.696 --> 02:30:00.679]  Oh my gosh.
[02:30:01.099 --> 02:30:01.559]  More from her.
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:11.965]  To secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.
[02:30:12.125 --> 02:30:13.766]  A little nod to the protesters outside.
[02:30:14.087 --> 02:30:16.068]  It's a perfectly politically correct down the line.
[02:30:17.250 --> 02:30:19.852]  I see a leader who understands.
[02:30:20.732 --> 02:30:26.675]  I see a leader with a real commitment to a better future for working families.
[02:30:26.715 --> 02:30:28.216]  Who's just been in power for four years.
[02:30:29.097 --> 02:30:32.398]  And Chicago, we have to help her win.
[02:30:33.859 --> 02:30:44.305]  Because we know that Donald Trump would sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends.
[02:30:45.094 --> 02:30:47.575]  They're giving 95% of the money to Kamala.
[02:30:48.016 --> 02:30:50.557]  Talk about Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:31:11.483 --> 02:31:17.789]  You cannot love this country if you only fight for the wealthy and big business.
[02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:21.532]  Open-air lunatic asylum.
[02:31:21.552 --> 02:31:27.698]  95% of the money, and I didn't say all the corporations are bad, but under the ESGs and BlackRock, they control 87%.
[02:31:28.038 --> 02:31:32.322]  The corporations are bad, they are evil, and they are supporting this woman.
[02:31:34.641 --> 02:31:42.862]  Ever since I got elected, Republicans have attacked me by saying that I should go back to bartending.
[02:31:42.882 --> 02:31:43.723]  But let me tell you,
[02:32:04.310 --> 02:32:10.594]  I'm happy to, any day of the week, because there is nothing wrong with working for a living.
[02:32:12.315 --> 02:32:16.617]  She's right about that.
[02:32:16.637 --> 02:32:19.959]  A lot of these, most of them were paid to be there, but some of these idiots actually believe this.
[02:32:19.999 --> 02:32:24.442]  Imagine having leaders in the White House who understand that.
[02:32:25.182 --> 02:32:27.384]  Leaders like Kamala and Tim.
[02:32:30.045 --> 02:32:30.826]  But Chicago?
[02:32:32.156 --> 02:32:37.781]  Just because the choice is clear to us does not mean that the path will be easy.
[02:32:38.622 --> 02:32:48.751]  Over the next 78 days, we will have to pour every ounce, every minute, every moment into making history on November 5th.
[02:32:52.314 --> 02:32:59.040]  But we cannot send Kamala and Tim to the White House alone.
[02:33:00.652 --> 02:33:14.856]  Together, we must also elect strong Democratic majorities in the House and in the Senate so that we can deliver on an ambitious agenda for the people.
[02:33:16.056 --> 02:33:23.438]  Because if you are a working parent trying to afford rent and child care, Kamala is for you.
[02:33:24.631 --> 02:33:33.575]  If you are a senior who had to go back to work because your retirement didn't stretch far enough, Kamala is for you.
[02:33:33.595 --> 02:33:43.280]  If you're an immigrant family just starting your American story, Kamala is for you.
[02:33:47.762 --> 02:33:51.844]  America, when we knock on our neighbor's door,
[02:33:52.942 --> 02:33:59.327]  Organize our communities and elect Kamala Harris to the presidency on November 5th.
[02:33:59.987 --> 02:34:04.850]  We will send a loud message that the people of this nation will not go back.
[02:34:05.171 --> 02:34:13.516]  We choose a new path and open the door to a new day, one that is for the people and by the people.
[02:34:13.536 --> 02:34:14.337]  Thank you.
[02:34:14.357 --> 02:34:15.818]  Thank you very much.
[02:34:15.838 --> 02:34:16.799]  God bless.
[02:34:30.222 --> 02:34:31.583]  Is Big Mike speaking tomorrow night?
[02:34:34.145 --> 02:34:37.528]  We already have the Big Mike theme song.
[02:34:38.228 --> 02:34:42.952]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[02:34:42.992 --> 02:34:43.793]  How about that AOC?
[02:34:43.813 --> 02:34:46.695]  Sounds like it's about a mental disorder.
[02:34:46.715 --> 02:34:53.080]  So Kamala Harris' story begins in a middle class neighborhood in the East Bay.
[02:34:54.922 --> 02:34:56.303]  Yeah.
[02:34:56.403 --> 02:34:58.625]  In a modest apartment above a nursery school.
[02:34:59.577 --> 02:35:02.718]  Let's go ahead and roll the new Michelle Obama theme song.
[02:35:02.898 --> 02:35:06.340]  She's released an official campaign song.
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:06.880]  Here it is.
[02:35:17.592 --> 02:35:20.775]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[02:35:21.215 --> 02:35:24.378]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS.
[02:35:24.538 --> 02:35:26.840]  An Anaconda, Burrock's favorite pet.
[02:35:27.621 --> 02:35:30.403]  Gets him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[02:35:31.063 --> 02:35:33.886]  Joan Rivers said it's true.
[02:35:34.206 --> 02:35:36.428]  Under the dress, it's become unglued.
[02:35:36.508 --> 02:35:37.209]  Put it back!
[02:35:37.909 --> 02:35:40.391]  Oh now, Big Mike's gonna let it show!
[02:35:50.228 --> 02:35:52.009]  So tomorrow night, that's gonna be her intro.
[02:35:53.731 --> 02:36:03.678]  But let's go to this little promo about how she came from a little house, like Jesus did, in a little manger.
[02:36:03.878 --> 02:36:04.298]  Here it is.
[02:36:09.242 --> 02:36:10.723]  It was a single mom.
[02:36:11.324 --> 02:36:15.547]  Life was not easy for them, but she loved her daughters fiercely.
[02:36:16.621 --> 02:36:24.765]  Kamala herself says that her mom told her that she may be the first to do many things, but to make sure that she's not the last.
[02:36:25.165 --> 02:36:31.268]  She's always been that kind of person, a true leader, and very protective of her friends and her family.
[02:36:32.408 --> 02:36:43.153]  When Kamala was all of four years old, her best friend in kindergarten, Stacey Johnson, got into something with another kid on the playground.
[02:36:44.082 --> 02:36:53.844]  This one particular day, we had made some clay art, and this one boy in our class had taken mine for whatever reason, and threw it on the ground, and it shattered.
[02:36:54.464 --> 02:36:59.605]  So Kamala, being very protective, just jumped in front of me and stood up to him.
[02:36:59.625 --> 02:37:04.446]  To me, that shows the kind of person that she has always been.
[02:37:04.526 --> 02:37:10.867]  To stand up to the bully, and to stand up for the underdog, and to stand up for what is right.
[02:37:11.667 --> 02:37:15.428]  Kamala carries the lessons of our mother.
[02:37:15.869 --> 02:37:18.029]  The fighting spirit of our mother.
[02:37:18.049 --> 02:37:20.030]  The compassion.
[02:37:20.050 --> 02:37:25.772]  And I have seen it over and over again in our growing up.
[02:37:25.792 --> 02:37:27.013]  You don't see all those innocent people in prison?
[02:37:27.053 --> 02:37:30.854]  When we were in high school, my sister's wife, Wanda, was being molested by a family member.
[02:37:38.823 --> 02:37:40.244]  This story's been told so many times.
[02:37:40.324 --> 02:37:43.927]  Is this the story about Joe Biden?
[02:37:43.967 --> 02:37:46.768]  By the way, isn't his daughter going to introduce him?
[02:37:46.788 --> 02:37:47.589]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.749 --> 02:37:50.771]  She's like, me and dad are going to take a shower.
[02:37:50.791 --> 02:37:53.392]  And water starts raining and big shower heads come down.
[02:37:53.553 --> 02:37:55.294]  And then he comes out naked.
[02:37:55.414 --> 02:37:58.776]  And she says, she has a musical.
[02:37:58.816 --> 02:38:01.938]  She goes, I think my father molested me.
[02:38:02.518 --> 02:38:04.239]  The shower may have been inappropriate.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:06.541]  What, me saying that?
[02:38:06.661 --> 02:38:08.202]  No, no, the shower may have been inappropriate.
[02:38:08.242 --> 02:38:09.103]  That's what she wrote in the diary.
[02:38:09.123 --> 02:38:11.185]  Like a huge showerhead that comes down like a production.
[02:38:11.725 --> 02:38:12.146]  It's raining.
[02:38:12.166 --> 02:38:14.328]  He goes, I'm singing in the shower.
[02:38:14.748 --> 02:38:16.369]  Just singing in the shower.
[02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:18.451]  What a glorious feeling.
[02:38:18.531 --> 02:38:20.493]  I'm getting molested again.
[02:38:23.576 --> 02:38:24.136]  Here we go.
[02:38:24.176 --> 02:38:25.517]  We knew Kamala's mother.
[02:38:32.155 --> 02:38:36.889]  I'm Stacey Johnson-Baptiste and this is my mom, Doris Johnson.
[02:38:36.909 --> 02:38:39.437]  Hi Doris.
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:44.903]  We are so excited and honored to be here with you.
[02:38:45.544 --> 02:38:49.487]  Kamala and I have known each other for a long time.
[02:38:51.048 --> 02:38:53.630]  We met at Berkwood Hedge School.
[02:38:54.211 --> 02:39:00.356]  We hit it off immediately and became each other's very first best friends.
[02:39:01.436 --> 02:39:04.199]  Our moms also became fast friends.
[02:39:05.168 --> 02:39:28.457]  And on weekends, we would pile into my 1966 Mustang, and Kamala's mom, Shyamala, would sit in the front with me, and Kamala and Maya and Stacy would sit in the back, and off we would go to a movie or some adventure.
[02:39:29.057 --> 02:39:31.458]  Did you see the kids smuggle across the border for sex slavery?
[02:39:31.478 --> 02:39:31.938]  What about that?
[02:39:32.813 --> 02:39:34.494]  How she blocked the DNA testing to save him?
[02:39:35.294 --> 02:39:36.754]  Yeah, yeah, it's funny.
[02:39:36.774 --> 02:39:40.435]  Kamala and I both get our grit from our mothers.
[02:39:41.296 --> 02:39:43.376]  Kamala has always been a protector.
[02:39:44.337 --> 02:39:55.380]  One day at school, we made clay art projects during story time when they were outside on tables to dry.
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:55.920]  This is riveting.
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:40:01.482]  For whatever reason, a boy in our class took mine, threw it on the ground, and it shattered.
[02:40:02.506 --> 02:40:11.231]  Kamala jumped in between him and me and said something that made him so mad he picked up a rock or something and hit her on the head.
[02:40:11.251 --> 02:40:13.233]  Alright, let's stop now and play clip three.
[02:40:13.953 --> 02:40:15.054]  This is breaking.
[02:40:15.154 --> 02:40:18.116]  Democrats announced plan to put conservatives in re-education camps.
[02:40:18.136 --> 02:40:20.557]  They're going to be very, very protective.
[02:40:21.398 --> 02:40:24.900]  Here is clip three and we'll come back to this Democrat national catastrophe.
[02:40:27.492 --> 02:40:30.475]  I would love everybody who's a Republican to get down.
[02:40:30.615 --> 02:40:32.536]  When they say, oh, we hate America.
[02:40:32.616 --> 02:40:33.017]  No, we don't.
[02:40:33.097 --> 02:40:33.697]  We hate you.
[02:40:34.298 --> 02:40:35.219]  We love America.
[02:40:35.299 --> 02:40:35.939]  We hate you.
[02:40:36.019 --> 02:40:37.521]  It's not good to hate anyone.
[02:40:37.741 --> 02:40:38.621]  I don't hate anyone.
[02:40:38.642 --> 02:40:42.084]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[02:40:42.985 --> 02:40:49.751]  If you were an elected official, do you think it might be a good idea to like put these Republican Trump supporting QAnon voters in like re-education facilities and stuff?
[02:40:49.811 --> 02:40:50.832]  Yeah, re-educate them?
[02:40:51.833 --> 02:40:55.696]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[02:40:57.976 --> 02:41:01.639]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[02:41:02.319 --> 02:41:12.648]  But I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24-7 on the internet, by their constituents, and they bought into this big lie.
[02:41:13.049 --> 02:41:20.295]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[02:41:20.895 --> 02:41:22.518]  There are millions of Americans.
[02:41:32.742 --> 02:41:39.209]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:43.613]  It's as if they are members of a cult.
[02:41:43.713 --> 02:41:52.262]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized people.
[02:41:53.082 --> 02:41:55.644]  And President Trump pulled the plug.
[02:41:56.104 --> 02:42:07.471]  One thing that we know is that we have to get that funding right back up and we probably need to double, triple, quadruple or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs.
[02:42:07.932 --> 02:42:15.677]  And sadly, so many of those extremists, those mega extremists, take their marching orders from Donald Trump who
[02:42:16.637 --> 02:42:20.338]  ...has no credibility left by any measure.
[02:42:20.838 --> 02:42:22.419]  He's only in it for himself.
[02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:25.740]  He's now defending himself in civil actions and criminal actions.
[02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:27.580]  And when do they break with him?
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:34.902]  You know, because at some point, you know, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of the cult members.
[02:42:35.242 --> 02:42:40.704]  They also believe that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they call the counter-revolution.
[02:42:42.325 --> 02:42:52.271]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[02:42:54.733 --> 02:43:01.017]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[02:43:02.521 --> 02:43:03.822]  How things were going to be.
[02:43:04.443 --> 02:43:05.243]  Let's stop right here.
[02:43:05.283 --> 02:43:07.285]  I'm going to get to this plan to put us in camps later.
[02:43:07.765 --> 02:43:12.869]  Hillary came sneaking out like a Black Widow spider while we were playing that clip.
[02:43:12.889 --> 02:43:14.271]  She doesn't know who they really are, but here she is.
[02:43:14.291 --> 02:43:18.474]  She's more popular than Kamala.
[02:43:18.594 --> 02:43:21.997]  And she lost.
[02:43:22.017 --> 02:43:24.819]  She's definitely a lot more evil and a lot smarter.
[02:43:24.839 --> 02:43:27.461]  And look at the cult, how much they love her.
[02:43:27.481 --> 02:43:30.844]  Thank you so much!
[02:43:30.864 --> 02:43:31.965]  Oh my God, was that you reading songs?
[02:43:35.848 --> 02:43:41.672]  There's a lot of energy in this room, just like there is across the country!
[02:43:41.712 --> 02:43:42.813]  Yeah, that's the talking point.
[02:43:43.554 --> 02:43:45.715]  We got a lot of energy.
[02:43:45.755 --> 02:43:46.196]  Oh my God.
[02:43:46.216 --> 02:43:46.976]  Mother Gorgon.
[02:43:46.996 --> 02:43:50.299]  Bring manufacturing back to America, please.
[02:43:50.439 --> 02:43:55.522]  Her and her husband oversaw the real transfer.
[02:43:56.683 --> 02:44:01.487]  Something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time.
[02:44:03.768 --> 02:44:04.569]  First, though,
[02:44:05.916 --> 02:44:08.997]  Let's salute President Biden.
[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:25.942]  He has been democracy's champion at home and abroad.
[02:44:27.463 --> 02:44:33.625]  He brought dignity, decency, and confidence back to the White House.
[02:44:35.572 --> 02:44:35.852]  Wow.
[02:44:36.773 --> 02:44:38.615]  Decency and competency.
[02:44:38.655 --> 02:44:43.260]  And he showed what it means to be a true patriot.
[02:44:44.681 --> 02:44:49.987]  Thank you, Joe Biden, for your lifetime of service and leadership.
[02:44:50.027 --> 02:44:53.250]  And that's why we cooed your ass and drugged you up for seven, eight days.
[02:44:53.731 --> 02:44:56.594]  A lot about the medical emergency and why he's all pissed.
[02:45:00.014 --> 02:45:00.915]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:45:01.315 --> 02:45:02.676]  Thank you for stealing the election.
[02:45:02.996 --> 02:45:04.177]  Then we stole it from you.
[02:45:04.958 --> 02:45:06.379]  Maybe we can steal it from Kamala.
[02:45:06.879 --> 02:45:08.260]  Who knows what we do.
[02:45:11.142 --> 02:45:16.186]  And now we are writing a new chapter in America's story.
[02:45:16.446 --> 02:45:19.549]  And our attempt to kill Trump failed, but we'll try again.
[02:45:19.569 --> 02:45:22.431]  Trying again, trying again, trying again.
[02:45:25.623 --> 02:45:31.166]  That changed 104 years ago yesterday.
[02:45:32.506 --> 02:45:33.207]  Think about it.
[02:45:34.507 --> 02:45:37.269]  Tennessee became the final state.
[02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:42.371]  Oh, the Democrats are fighting slavery and segregation now.
[02:45:43.012 --> 02:45:47.354]  To ratify the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
[02:45:48.674 --> 02:45:53.417]  The state legislature was deadlocked until
[02:45:54.644 --> 02:46:05.591]  One lawmaker's mother, a widow who read three newspapers a day, sent a letter, a letter to her son.
[02:46:05.611 --> 02:46:08.692]  No more delays, she wrote.
[02:46:09.313 --> 02:46:10.874]  Give us the vote.
[02:46:11.994 --> 02:46:18.318]  And since that day, every generation has carried the torch forward.
[02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:21.332]  This has nothing to do with putting a woman in.
[02:46:21.372 --> 02:46:22.893]  It's all about their power.
[02:46:49.762 --> 02:46:56.705]  You know, I know a really nice woman since I was three years old.
[02:46:57.186 --> 02:46:58.546]  She's our family's best friend.
[02:46:58.566 --> 02:46:59.547]  Her husband's dead.
[02:46:59.567 --> 02:47:02.088]  But they grew up across the street from them.
[02:47:02.128 --> 02:47:02.989]  She's a great lady.
[02:47:03.509 --> 02:47:06.450]  And she literally looks and sounds just like Hillary Clinton.
[02:47:06.490 --> 02:47:07.971]  People think she's Hillary when she does her hair.
[02:47:09.761 --> 02:47:10.501]  Yeah.
[02:47:11.102 --> 02:47:12.042]  She's probably watching right now.
[02:47:12.062 --> 02:47:12.842]  He lives in Austin.
[02:47:13.263 --> 02:47:14.343]  Her name's Krista.
[02:47:14.403 --> 02:47:18.245]  And I'm not trying to be mean to her, but she knows she looks and sounds like Hillary.
[02:47:18.285 --> 02:47:19.125]  You know what we should do?
[02:47:19.145 --> 02:47:22.807]  We should get her to go to a lesbian bar, and we should, like, photograph it, like, you know, underground.
[02:47:22.847 --> 02:47:27.389]  Like, oh, Hillary spotted a lesbian.
[02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:28.069]  Would she do it?
[02:47:28.089 --> 02:47:28.770]  Yeah.
[02:47:31.311 --> 02:47:31.991]  Teach me a Democrat.
[02:47:32.011 --> 02:47:32.871]  She's a Republican now.
[02:47:33.471 --> 02:47:34.292]  Big Trump supporter.
[02:47:34.832 --> 02:47:35.752]  Been one for about eight years.
[02:47:35.892 --> 02:47:36.972]  That's crazy.
[02:47:37.232 --> 02:47:40.593]  I have a friend from Nashville that looks just like Cenk Uygur from the Young Turks.
[02:47:40.853 --> 02:47:43.214]  But he's exactly the opposite in all political persuasion.
[02:47:43.274 --> 02:47:44.234]  Sounds like him, looks like him.
[02:47:45.154 --> 02:47:45.894]  But he's still ugly.
[02:47:48.515 --> 02:47:49.515]  He doesn't like animal sex.
[02:47:49.615 --> 02:47:50.095]  Animal sex?
[02:47:50.315 --> 02:47:50.575]  No.
[02:47:51.735 --> 02:47:52.556]  I'm being mean.
[02:47:52.576 --> 02:47:53.016]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:55.370 --> 02:47:56.931]  Guys, pull up St.
[02:47:56.971 --> 02:48:01.574]  Ugar talking about having—if he was emperor, he would, uh, pleasure animals.
[02:48:01.714 --> 02:48:06.477]  Well, no, I don't like to say that cauliflowers are racist without showing on Earth.
[02:48:06.537 --> 02:48:08.258]  I mean, I'm gonna say that St.
[02:48:08.338 --> 02:48:11.260]  Ugar wants to be emperor of the Earth so he can have pleasure animals.
[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:12.300]  I mean, it's a real quote.
[02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:13.301]  Look at that woman, dude.
[02:48:14.262 --> 02:48:17.844]  She literally looks like some, like, ancient monitor lizard or something.
[02:48:20.553 --> 02:48:24.535]  Her first job out of Kamala.
[02:48:24.555 --> 02:48:27.597]  Kamala's mother is Hindu, so technically she's been reincarnated.
[02:48:28.417 --> 02:48:34.160]  Because the Chicago Mafia ran Arkansas to help rich pedophiles was her first job, Hillary's.
[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:34.601]  Yes.
[02:48:35.021 --> 02:48:37.082]  Like send Missy down there to work for the pedophiles.
[02:48:37.182 --> 02:48:41.024]  Is she on tape saying that she'll never trust another lie detector test again because she was defending a rapist?
[02:48:41.164 --> 02:48:42.925]  She laughed and said, I knew he'd rape the girl.
[02:48:43.426 --> 02:48:45.667]  We've had the woman that got raped that these men kidnapped her.
[02:48:46.877 --> 02:48:48.238]  She was on a bicycle, 11 years old.
[02:48:48.278 --> 02:48:51.420]  They took her, raped her for a day and a half in a hunting shed.
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:55.942]  Took a broom handle and crushed her cervix so she could never have kids.
[02:48:55.962 --> 02:48:57.803]  And Hillary laughed about it.
[02:48:57.823 --> 02:48:58.944]  She thought it was really great.
[02:48:58.964 --> 02:48:59.444]  She laughed about that.
[02:48:59.464 --> 02:49:00.185]  She defended that guy.
[02:49:00.485 --> 02:49:00.645]  Yep.
[02:49:01.906 --> 02:49:02.606]  It wasn't that guy.
[02:49:03.107 --> 02:49:04.387]  They gang raped her for a day and a half.
[02:49:04.727 --> 02:49:05.048]  Man.
[02:49:06.448 --> 02:49:06.889]  Nice people.
[02:49:08.208 --> 02:49:11.791]  Let's see, it wasn't but a few hours from Chicago to Arkansas.
[02:49:11.831 --> 02:49:12.611]  There was nobody there.
[02:49:13.012 --> 02:49:14.573]  They could own it in Little Rock and Hot Springs.
[02:49:15.153 --> 02:49:20.317]  That's where Al Capone and all of them lived at the Arlington Hotel in Hot Springs, and they owned it all.
[02:49:20.737 --> 02:49:26.541]  And during Prohibition, that's where they actually made most of the moonshine they would put coloring and flavoring in.
[02:49:26.882 --> 02:49:27.782]  Tell people it was bourbon.
[02:49:28.343 --> 02:49:28.483]  Right.
[02:49:28.903 --> 02:49:36.971]  So a lot more stuff came from Arkansas and they would also get it from Texas and Oklahoma and a few of the states in the south than what was produced in Canada.
[02:49:36.991 --> 02:49:39.554]  I was hearing about the rum boats coming across.
[02:49:39.974 --> 02:49:41.116]  That was Joe Kennedy.
[02:49:41.556 --> 02:49:42.517]  But no, it was all Arkansas.
[02:49:45.342 --> 02:49:46.863]  There is always a choice.
[02:49:47.503 --> 02:49:49.604]  Do we push forward or pull back?
[02:49:50.084 --> 02:49:56.086]  Come together as we the people, or split into us versus them.
[02:49:56.126 --> 02:50:01.989]  Let's play the clip of the DNC today bypassing all the delegates, because usually they just order the delegates to vote for who they want.
[02:50:02.029 --> 02:50:03.729]  Now they don't even need stinking delegates.
[02:50:03.749 --> 02:50:05.870]  It's like three amigos.
[02:50:06.130 --> 02:50:06.651]  Badges?
[02:50:06.731 --> 02:50:08.371]  We don't need no stinking badges.
[02:50:09.252 --> 02:50:12.113]  Here's the DNC today, just total dictatorship.
[02:50:12.473 --> 02:50:14.774]  And then Cenk Uygur and his favorite pastime.
[02:50:17.128 --> 02:50:28.255]  And on Thursday, my friends, we'll hear a ceremonial nominating speech for our presidential nominee, and Vice President Harris will make her acceptance speech.
[02:50:33.358 --> 02:50:38.642]  So now, delegates, the chair will entertain a motion to approve the up-to-date agenda.
[02:50:39.182 --> 02:50:40.083]  Is there a second?
[02:50:42.404 --> 02:50:45.386]  All in favor of approving the convention agenda, please say aye.
[02:50:46.770 --> 02:50:48.071]  All opposed say nay!
[02:50:49.052 --> 02:50:50.132]  The ayes have it!
[02:50:52.254 --> 02:50:53.234]  Now do you notice that trick?
[02:50:54.555 --> 02:50:55.156]  Notice that trick?
[02:50:56.296 --> 02:50:58.638]  He says on Thursday we'll have a ceremonial vote.
[02:50:58.938 --> 02:51:00.119]  That was the real one right there.
[02:51:00.139 --> 02:51:00.299]  Yeah.
[02:51:00.399 --> 02:51:03.261]  And they just slipped it through like, boop, it's done, no big deal.
[02:51:03.801 --> 02:51:03.961]  Yep.
[02:51:04.422 --> 02:51:06.483]  Real, like, like you steal votes at 2 a.m.
[02:51:06.523 --> 02:51:09.285]  with those trucks coming in and blocking the windows.
[02:51:10.185 --> 02:51:10.966]  Now let's go to St.
[02:51:11.106 --> 02:51:12.727]  Ugar and if he was emperor of the earth.
[02:51:14.048 --> 02:51:16.971]  I have decided what that boing-boing chick was doing.
[02:51:17.031 --> 02:51:19.673]  She was doing a jaywalking of Beastiality.
[02:51:20.453 --> 02:51:25.558]  Like, yeah, it might technically be a crime, but let's not waste the court's time on jaywalking.
[02:51:25.658 --> 02:51:25.918]  Okay.
[02:51:26.118 --> 02:51:27.379]  Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
[02:51:27.539 --> 02:51:29.741]  But here comes the controversial part, the part I shouldn't say.
[02:51:31.483 --> 02:51:42.592]  I believe that if I were the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize Beastiality where you are giving
[02:51:44.773 --> 02:51:47.216]  You are, you are pleasuring an animal.
[02:51:47.236 --> 02:51:49.298]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:51:50.399 --> 02:51:50.760]  Okay.
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:51.220]  Okay.
[02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:51.881]  Well now, why?
[02:51:51.961 --> 02:51:52.742]  Why did that happen?
[02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:54.764]  It's the dumbest thing I've said.
[02:51:54.784 --> 02:51:56.166]  It really is the dumbest thing you've said.
[02:51:56.186 --> 02:51:57.127]  No, no, I'll tell you why.
[02:51:57.167 --> 02:51:57.707]  I'll tell you why.
[02:51:58.028 --> 02:52:05.837]  Because like, so there's like, was the case that we covered where there was like a guy or a girl or something that was pleasuring a horse, and the horse came to a conclusion, right?
[02:52:07.942 --> 02:52:20.188]  You know that people who are, okay look, not to be a downer about what you're saying, because what you're saying sounds kind of funny, but a lot of people who are being raped can actually, like, have an orgasm.
[02:52:20.688 --> 02:52:22.969]  So, like, if a guy is being raped, he can have an orgasm.
[02:52:23.009 --> 02:52:26.511]  Like, you can't say, oh, if you cum, that means you wanted it.
[02:52:26.571 --> 02:52:27.752]  That's not the right way to go.
[02:52:28.234 --> 02:52:30.356]  But number one, you're being an unbelievable downer.
[02:52:30.456 --> 02:52:31.917]  I am, but that's the truth.
[02:52:31.937 --> 02:52:33.058]  That's the downer of humans.
[02:52:33.178 --> 02:52:35.640]  Number three, I mean, what really happens with horses?
[02:52:35.781 --> 02:52:36.481]  Did you mind?
[02:52:37.542 --> 02:52:38.743]  The answer's gotta be, no!
[02:52:38.863 --> 02:52:41.245]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:52:42.066 --> 02:52:42.326]  Enough.
[02:52:42.967 --> 02:52:44.488]  So he wants to be like jaywalking.
[02:52:44.648 --> 02:52:48.272]  There's famous cases where, like, you catch your neighbor raping your horse.
[02:52:49.252 --> 02:52:53.056]  Speaking of raping people, Bill Clinton's a big rapist.
[02:52:53.076 --> 02:52:53.896]  Hillary would cover it up.
[02:52:53.916 --> 02:52:54.237]  Here it is.
[02:52:56.065 --> 02:53:00.488]  She reveres our Medal of Honor recipients.
[02:53:03.549 --> 02:53:08.052]  She won't be sending love letters to dictators.
[02:53:09.513 --> 02:53:13.915]  She will defend democracy and our Constitution and will protect America from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:53:25.612 --> 02:53:30.076]  The Constitution says the President's job is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
[02:53:30.536 --> 02:53:31.577]  Those are the words of our founders.
[02:53:31.617 --> 02:53:32.378]  Take care.
[02:53:32.478 --> 02:53:33.919]  Just look at the candidates.
[02:53:49.648 --> 02:53:54.252]  Kamala cares, cares about kids and families, cares about America.
[02:53:54.272 --> 02:53:58.054]  She cares about getting rid of the DNA testing and smuggling kids into sex slavery.
[02:54:00.016 --> 02:54:02.838]  She cares about massive inflation, raping your life.
[02:54:02.858 --> 02:54:09.183]  On her first day in court, Kamala said five words that still guide her.
[02:54:10.103 --> 02:54:12.826]  Kamala Harris, for the people.
[02:54:12.846 --> 02:54:14.727]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:16.818 --> 02:54:21.222]  That is something that Donald Trump will never understand.
[02:54:22.042 --> 02:54:24.885]  So it is no surprise... You want Hillary Clinton, you want World War III.
[02:54:24.905 --> 02:54:26.766]  ...that he is lying about Kamala's record.
[02:54:27.487 --> 02:54:30.249]  He's mocking her name and her laugh.
[02:54:31.170 --> 02:54:32.050]  Sounds familiar.
[02:54:32.070 --> 02:54:34.492]  Hers is pretty bad.
[02:54:34.592 --> 02:54:40.137]  Hillary's... But we have him on the run now.
[02:54:40.497 --> 02:54:43.719]  In fact, guys, please find Hillary laughing.
[02:54:47.369 --> 02:54:51.793]  Placebong or whatever it's called on Placeboing Blong Bong on YouTube.
[02:54:51.813 --> 02:54:53.214]  It's like eight years old.
[02:54:57.478 --> 02:55:01.462]  That's a good question.
[02:55:01.482 --> 02:55:04.385]  Why do both of them have very horrible witch-like laughs?
[02:55:04.725 --> 02:55:05.886]  Because they're witches.
[02:55:05.926 --> 02:55:07.568]  We have to fight for the truth.
[02:55:08.048 --> 02:55:11.751]  We have to fight for Kamala as she will fight for us.
[02:55:12.252 --> 02:55:13.173]  Because you know what?
[02:55:14.642 --> 02:55:19.887]  It still takes a village to raise a family, heal a country, and win the campaign!
[02:55:19.947 --> 02:55:21.008]  We saw.
[02:55:21.068 --> 02:55:24.331]  He died.
[02:55:24.411 --> 02:55:25.272]  We came.
[02:55:25.292 --> 02:55:25.572]  We saw.
[02:55:25.612 --> 02:55:26.092]  He died.
[02:55:27.634 --> 02:55:28.214]  We came.
[02:55:28.234 --> 02:55:28.935]  We saw.
[02:55:56.387 --> 02:56:05.030]  It's not a laughing matter.
[02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:07.531]  I take it really seriously.
[02:56:15.988 --> 02:56:20.030]  A woman running to be the first woman president.
[02:56:20.090 --> 02:56:22.752]  You can't even define what a woman is.
[02:56:33.698 --> 02:56:35.479]  Donald Trump couldn't be a woman.
[02:56:35.519 --> 02:56:37.420]  Who could be more of an outsider than a woman president?
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:41.563]  Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president.
[02:56:41.583 --> 02:56:43.464]  A woman president of the United States of America!
[02:56:43.504 --> 02:56:43.644]  Women!

[02:56:57.512 --> 02:56:57.672]  Women!
[02:56:57.692 --> 02:56:57.812]  Women!
[02:56:57.892 --> 02:56:59.353]  Women!
[02:56:59.373 --> 02:56:59.613]  Women!
[02:56:59.633 --> 02:56:59.914]  Women!
[02:56:59.994 --> 02:57:00.354]  Women!
[02:57:00.374 --> 02:57:00.634]  Women!
[02:57:00.654 --> 02:57:00.934]  Women!
[02:57:01.274 --> 02:57:01.434]  Women!
[02:57:01.454 --> 02:57:01.554]  Women!
[02:57:01.575 --> 02:57:01.675]  Women!
[02:57:01.695 --> 02:57:01.815]  Women!
[02:57:01.835 --> 02:57:01.975]  Women!
[02:57:01.995 --> 02:57:02.155]  Women!
[02:57:02.175 --> 02:57:02.295]  Women!
[02:57:03.046 --> 02:57:06.107]  Oh yeah, the Globals really care about alignment.
[02:57:06.147 --> 02:57:06.347]  Woo!
[02:57:30.939 --> 02:57:33.880]  Let's roll the little World War III ad that helped defeat Hillary.
[02:57:34.661 --> 02:57:37.442]  Got 20 million views on YouTube before they banned us.
[02:57:37.462 --> 02:57:39.043]  Go ahead and unroll this classic video.
[02:57:39.063 --> 02:57:41.724]  Here it is.
[02:57:41.744 --> 02:57:47.987]  Nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:57:48.527 --> 02:57:56.171]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:57:56.451 --> 02:57:58.552]  As president, I will make it clear
[02:57:59.412 --> 02:58:04.174]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:58:04.734 --> 02:58:10.076]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:58:10.156 --> 02:58:13.657]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:58:13.697 --> 02:58:16.498]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:58:16.559 --> 02:58:19.119]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:58:21.522 --> 02:58:23.564]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:58:23.904 --> 02:58:27.387]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:58:27.567 --> 02:58:35.474]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:58:45.962 --> 02:58:46.602]  Can we break through?
[02:58:46.622 --> 02:58:48.183]  The future is here!
[02:58:48.343 --> 02:58:49.243]  It's in our grasp!
[02:58:49.503 --> 02:58:51.563]  Let's go with it!
[02:58:51.963 --> 02:59:01.486]  This is what I'm concerned about, the repercussions.
[02:59:01.626 --> 02:59:06.147]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[02:59:07.547 --> 02:59:09.987]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:59:10.007 --> 02:59:12.208]  We'll try to get Leigh-Anne back on in a few minutes.
[02:59:16.061 --> 02:59:20.463]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:59:46.852 --> 02:59:47.933]  I want to say great job, crew.
[02:59:47.953 --> 02:59:49.594]  Oh boy, that was a great job.
[02:59:49.634 --> 02:59:51.216]  Boy, the crew's been up here working since 6am.
[03:00:12.401 --> 03:00:17.744]  I want to salute them, I've been up since 5am.
[03:00:17.804 --> 03:00:19.065]  Oh yeah.
[03:00:19.125 --> 03:00:24.668]  The Democrats literally ran and engineered with Larry Summers and all of them.
[03:00:24.929 --> 03:00:29.872]  The banking scam, the housing crisis, they were the authors of that.
[03:00:30.072 --> 03:00:32.893]  Republicans were the authors of the Iraq war and stuff, they were bad too.
[03:00:42.023 --> 03:00:49.684]  I'm already bored.
[03:00:49.744 --> 03:00:53.385]  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
[03:00:54.645 --> 03:00:56.225]  Wow, Jim Clyburn!
[03:00:56.465 --> 03:00:57.086]  Wow!
[03:00:58.466 --> 03:00:59.306]  Thank you!
[03:01:01.066 --> 03:01:02.106]  That's incredible!
[03:01:02.126 --> 03:01:04.667]  Oh my god, it's Clyburn!
[03:01:06.907 --> 03:01:08.187]  Please, please, settle down.
[03:01:08.227 --> 03:01:10.388]  You're throwing the panties at him like it's Elvis.
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:16.982]  Thank you, South Carolina!
[03:01:17.022 --> 03:01:17.982]  Throws him back at him.
[03:01:18.283 --> 03:01:19.844]  He comes out in a pink tutu.
[03:01:21.585 --> 03:01:22.886]  That'd be something I'd watch.
[03:01:23.046 --> 03:01:25.668]  Four years ago... You should be the director next time.
[03:01:25.708 --> 03:01:29.490]  Americans were experiencing high... Surprising I have a drag queen story time.
[03:01:30.031 --> 03:01:30.971]  That's the real policy.
[03:01:31.172 --> 03:01:33.033]  ...and great uncertainties.
[03:01:34.534 --> 03:01:36.415]  A daily virus ranged.
[03:01:38.036 --> 03:01:40.358]  Schools closed.
[03:01:40.598 --> 03:01:41.699]  Businesses shuttered.
[03:01:43.308 --> 03:01:50.117]  Donald Trump mismanaged the crisis from day one, looking out for himself— No, he tried to stop it.
[03:01:50.157 --> 03:01:51.058]  You guys expanded it.
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:59.970]  The American people responded to the crisis in leadership by electing new leaders.
[03:02:01.636 --> 03:02:10.818]  Thanks to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we reopened our schools, brought back our businesses, and restored our jobs.
[03:02:10.938 --> 03:02:14.279]  They had the unions keep it totally closed under Trump even though he wanted it open, remember?
[03:02:14.459 --> 03:02:18.300]  And then when they got power, they wanted to keep squeezing, they kept it closed for another almost year.
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:29.563]  Thanks to Joe and Kamala, we reduced the price of prescription drugs, repaired roads and bridges, and replaced lead pipes.
[03:02:30.552 --> 03:02:40.756]  Thanks to Joe and Kamala, we are honoring our heroes in uniform and expanding benefits to over a million veterans.
[03:02:41.677 --> 03:02:54.142]  Thanks to Joe and Kamala, Make it in America is no longer just a slogan, but a movement that is bringing millions of manufacturing jobs back to America.
[03:02:55.343 --> 03:02:58.164]  For President Biden's lifetime of achievement,
[03:02:58.971 --> 03:03:05.535]  In service of his country, we owe him a great debt of gratitude.
[03:03:10.778 --> 03:03:23.705]  And we're all grateful for one of the best decisions he made, selecting Kamala Harris as his vice president and endorsing her to succeed him.
[03:03:30.129 --> 03:03:34.913]  I often say that we are but the sum of our experiences.
[03:03:36.434 --> 03:03:44.720]  In the introduction to my memoir, I wrote, all my experiences have not been pleasant.
[03:03:45.914 --> 03:03:50.257]  I can't believe they're allowing Joe Biden to speak this late at night.
[03:03:50.397 --> 03:03:53.620]  He probably just got up at like 6 o'clock tonight.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:57.122]  When he's a good boy, they control the doctor, they give him the meth.
[03:03:57.302 --> 03:03:58.823]  He had a medical emergency.
[03:03:58.863 --> 03:04:02.526]  They probably had a placebo in Vegas.
[03:04:03.146 --> 03:04:08.110]  He had a medical emergency, disappeared for eight days, and then he kept shuffling on the plane.
[03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:09.951]  They go, why'd you step down?
[03:04:09.971 --> 03:04:10.892]  I didn't do that.
[03:04:10.912 --> 03:04:10.992]  What?
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.508]  And they told Jill and all of them, we're gonna throw your ass in prison if you don't let us run this.
[03:04:20.848 --> 03:04:25.795]  That's why, you know, he's gone out and done one stump speech where he endorsed her, but all the other times he's talked crap.
[03:04:26.536 --> 03:04:27.618]  So will he control himself?
[03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.365]  But like you said, he may just resign tonight.
[03:04:31.405 --> 03:04:35.528]  What if he comes out and he just announces that he's, you know, he's reinstating his campaign?
[03:04:35.548 --> 03:04:36.829]  What if he comes out in a big diaper?
[03:04:36.989 --> 03:04:39.611]  Takes off his panties, throws them at the crowd.
[03:04:49.289 --> 03:04:52.911]  Which in my opinion is Jim Crow 2.0.
[03:04:53.271 --> 03:04:56.592]  They've been saying that for everything.
[03:04:57.292 --> 03:04:59.794]  And there's no way he read all 900 pages of Project 2024.
[03:05:00.054 --> 03:05:00.474]  Whatever.
[03:05:00.614 --> 03:05:02.655]  All the Republican think tanks have their different platforms.
[03:05:02.695 --> 03:05:03.415]  It always happens.
[03:05:03.835 --> 03:05:05.936]  A lot of good ideas in there.
[03:05:05.976 --> 03:05:08.257]  But Trump has put out his project before that.
[03:05:08.277 --> 03:05:08.257]  2024.
[03:05:08.577 --> 03:05:14.640]  I often look to the good book for understanding
[03:05:15.496 --> 03:05:18.197]  And it tells me to abort babies and have pedophiles.
[03:05:18.217 --> 03:05:23.399]  Because we control the Justice Department, we're gonna steal it again.
[03:05:23.419 --> 03:05:30.321]  We're gonna block the windows of the voting centers, and by 2 a.m., she's gonna win.
[03:05:44.844 --> 03:05:48.987]  And so has the basic goodness of the American people.
[03:05:49.027 --> 03:05:50.728]  Okay, so let's start this over.
[03:05:50.929 --> 03:05:51.849]  I began it earlier.
[03:05:52.650 --> 03:05:54.351]  Clip three on Chase's list.
[03:05:54.371 --> 03:05:56.973]  It's a really powerful video up on X that Rob do put together.
[03:05:57.013 --> 03:05:58.694]  He saw me talk about today and got all the clips.
[03:05:59.375 --> 03:06:03.077]  Breaking Democrats announced plan to put conservatives in re-education camps.
[03:06:03.097 --> 03:06:04.218]  They're deadly serious about it.
[03:06:04.658 --> 03:06:05.379]  Here's the report.
[03:06:05.499 --> 03:06:08.621]  And then, uh, no, we didn't play the whole thing.
[03:06:09.582 --> 03:06:11.644]  We stopped it because Hillary came out.
[03:06:12.515 --> 03:06:13.456]  So we're going to.
[03:06:13.556 --> 03:06:15.857]  It's very important only played two minutes of it.
[03:06:17.398 --> 03:06:21.400]  And then we're going to play this report and then we'll come back and then again.
[03:06:23.521 --> 03:06:25.782]  Biden's daughter and you're going to have a shower together.
[03:06:25.802 --> 03:06:26.543]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[03:06:26.703 --> 03:06:27.663]  Let's see who's coming out now.
[03:06:28.464 --> 03:06:31.145]  And then if it didn't, if it didn't, uh, it isn't Ashley.
[03:06:31.445 --> 03:06:36.068]  If it didn't actually Biden in a shower cap, we will, uh,
[03:06:41.209 --> 03:06:43.370]  Alright, let's see what crap they're about to come up with.
[03:06:43.390 --> 03:06:53.757]  Go back to him.
[03:06:55.178 --> 03:06:58.800]  Go ahead and roll how they want to put us in camps while they accuse Trump of this.
[03:06:58.820 --> 03:06:59.180]  Here it is.
[03:07:00.061 --> 03:07:03.063]  I would love everybody who's a Republican to get down.
[03:07:03.203 --> 03:07:05.624]  When they say, oh we hate America, no we don't.
[03:07:05.685 --> 03:07:06.145]  We hate you!
[03:07:06.886 --> 03:07:07.787]  We love America!
[03:07:07.847 --> 03:07:08.507]  We hate you!
[03:07:08.587 --> 03:07:10.088]  It's not good to hate anyone.
[03:07:10.308 --> 03:07:11.189]  I don't hate anyone.
[03:07:11.389 --> 03:07:14.651]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[03:07:15.552 --> 03:07:21.936]  If you were an elected official, do you think it might be a good idea to put these Republican Trump-supporting QAnon voters in re-education facilities?
[03:07:22.377 --> 03:07:22.617]  Yes!
[03:07:22.637 --> 03:07:23.317]  Re-educate them?
[03:07:23.337 --> 03:07:23.397]  Yes!
[03:07:24.378 --> 03:07:28.261]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:34.213]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[03:07:34.894 --> 03:07:45.224]  But I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24-7 on the internet, by their constituents, and they bought into this big lie.
[03:07:45.624 --> 03:07:52.871]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[03:07:53.431 --> 03:08:01.362]  And the bottom line is all of America needs programming because we've all been negatively influenced by Donald Trump.
[03:08:05.319 --> 03:08:11.786]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[03:08:13.107 --> 03:08:16.170]  It's as if they are members of a cult.
[03:08:16.290 --> 03:08:24.839]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized people.
[03:08:25.639 --> 03:08:31.561]  And sadly, so many of those extremists, those mega extremists, take their marching orders from Donald Trump, who
[03:08:49.446 --> 03:08:49.866]  No, no.
[03:09:03.675 --> 03:09:07.477]  You know, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of the cult members.
[03:09:07.817 --> 03:09:13.339]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[03:09:14.899 --> 03:09:24.763]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[03:09:28.067 --> 03:09:30.212]  Back it up 20 seconds because I had to make this point.
[03:09:31.695 --> 03:09:34.240]  Jamie Raskin called for civil war and put people in camps.
[03:09:34.601 --> 03:09:37.947]  He's on TV right now while we're playing this clip about camps.
[03:09:39.445 --> 03:09:45.126]  The whole January 6th guy tried to put me in prison, then destroyed all the tapes, all the evidence January 6th is pointed towards them.
[03:09:45.146 --> 03:09:46.967]  I think he's in this compilation.
[03:09:47.007 --> 03:09:48.747]  I told you two, I haven't watched the compilation yet.
[03:09:49.127 --> 03:09:50.408]  But again, they're just everywhere.
[03:09:50.448 --> 03:09:53.608]  This guy wants civil war in camps for us, and forced injections.
[03:09:53.628 --> 03:09:54.729]  His dad was a famous communist.
[03:09:55.189 --> 03:09:55.869]  Great job, folks.
[03:09:55.909 --> 03:10:00.990]  Now go back to, back up the video 20 seconds with Larry Grathwald, and then we'll finish it.
[03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.330]  Here it is.
[03:10:04.426 --> 03:10:08.209]  You know, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of the cult members.
[03:10:08.549 --> 03:10:14.094]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[03:10:15.655 --> 03:10:25.543]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[03:10:28.035 --> 03:10:37.158]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[03:10:38.078 --> 03:10:41.679]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[03:10:42.399 --> 03:10:44.420]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:48.181]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[03:10:49.581 --> 03:10:54.623]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people.
[03:10:55.795 --> 03:10:57.356]  In these re-education centers.
[03:10:57.996 --> 03:10:59.737]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[03:11:00.258 --> 03:11:02.159]  So I have the solution.
[03:11:03.139 --> 03:11:14.706]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not talking about, well, hesitants, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[03:11:16.146 --> 03:11:19.368]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[03:11:20.068 --> 03:11:22.550]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[03:11:24.352 --> 03:11:24.972]  Immigrants.
[03:11:25.333 --> 03:11:32.876]  Quite honestly, you know, the health sector doesn't know what to do because this is now first and foremost a political problem.
[03:11:34.017 --> 03:11:41.981]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[03:11:42.001 --> 03:11:50.325]  We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[03:11:50.465 --> 03:11:51.646]  And I've said the same with
[03:11:52.302 --> 03:12:02.909]  I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva at WHO, the Director General, to say, I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[03:12:02.969 --> 03:12:05.531]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[03:12:06.271 --> 03:12:14.456]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[03:12:14.476 --> 03:12:15.497]  200,000 Americans died.
[03:12:17.771 --> 03:12:21.194]  Because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[03:12:21.715 --> 03:12:24.617]  And so this is now a lethal force.
[03:12:24.817 --> 03:12:35.167]  And now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives,
[03:12:35.859 --> 03:12:40.142]  The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[03:12:40.622 --> 03:12:48.887]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[03:12:48.927 --> 03:12:53.070]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions.
[03:12:53.090 --> 03:12:59.814]  And look, the same guy speaking right now.
[03:13:01.018 --> 03:13:10.324]  This is the first vice president in more than two centuries not to support the president he served with in a general election.
[03:13:10.344 --> 03:13:13.426]  These people are dangerous.
[03:13:13.566 --> 03:13:15.587]  By the way, J.D.
[03:13:15.647 --> 03:13:25.333]  Vance, do you understand why there was a sudden job opening for Running Mate on the GOP ticket?
[03:13:27.494 --> 03:13:29.896]  They tried to kill your predecessor!
[03:13:32.925 --> 03:13:42.492]  They tried to kill him because he would not follow Trump's plan to destroy and nullify the vote of millions of Americans.
[03:13:42.532 --> 03:13:42.812]  Pence?
[03:13:43.232 --> 03:13:45.314]  He just said January 6th they tried to kill Pence.
[03:13:45.334 --> 03:13:46.094]  That's what he was implying.
[03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:48.196]  And then meanwhile they just tried to kill Trump for real.
[03:13:48.356 --> 03:13:49.356]  Totally disregard that.
[03:13:49.437 --> 03:13:53.760]  Your votes Georgia, Nevada, Arizona.
[03:13:54.727 --> 03:13:55.507]  Man, this guy's evil.
[03:13:55.547 --> 03:13:59.169]  Oh, his dad's a famous communist who supported people in camps in the Soviet Union.
[03:13:59.270 --> 03:14:01.271]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:01.291 --> 03:14:08.595]  Says we're gonna have a civil war.
[03:14:08.615 --> 03:14:10.716]  They tried to kill Trump.
[03:14:13.737 --> 03:14:14.458]  Look at this idiot.
[03:14:16.025 --> 03:14:16.606]  They're desperate.
[03:14:16.626 --> 03:14:19.108]  They know no one's voting for them in those cities.
[03:14:19.168 --> 03:14:20.689]  It's all election fraud.
[03:14:20.969 --> 03:14:22.010]  It's a criminal syndicate.
[03:14:22.711 --> 03:14:24.512]  It's hijacked America, and it's going down.
[03:14:25.473 --> 03:14:29.877]  Well, look, one week after that beautiful day, as Trump calls it,
[03:14:30.669 --> 03:14:32.850]  He said it was a beautiful day until that happened.
[03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:34.810]  He's never been convicted of any of that.
[03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:37.011]  All lies by this dirty lawyer.
[03:14:37.431 --> 03:14:39.932]  Alright, fade him down for a minute.
[03:14:40.372 --> 03:14:41.652]  Everybody knows this crap.
[03:14:41.712 --> 03:14:43.353]  You've got a concern here and so do I.
[03:14:54.162 --> 03:14:56.544]  Um, Biden always speaks at 45 minutes an hour late.
[03:14:56.964 --> 03:14:58.225]  He's already supposed to be speaking now.
[03:14:59.025 --> 03:15:00.606]  Tell us they have an updated list.
[03:15:00.626 --> 03:15:03.048]  Tell us how many horrible demons are going to speak before.
[03:15:03.268 --> 03:15:05.270]  So right now we've got Jamie Raskin speaking.
[03:15:05.550 --> 03:15:09.132]  Next up is Jasmine Crockett, who is a house representative from Texas.
[03:15:09.492 --> 03:15:11.594]  Then Grace Meng, a representative from New York.
[03:15:11.954 --> 03:15:17.098]  Then, joint remarks from Zarofsky of Texas, Joshua of Louisiana, and Duvall of Kentucky.
[03:15:17.218 --> 03:15:19.560]  Then, Andy Beshear, the Governor of Kentucky.
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:22.742]  Then, Reverend Raphael G. Warnock from Georgia.
[03:15:22.903 --> 03:15:25.364]  Then, Chris Coons, the United States Senator from Delaware.
[03:15:25.525 --> 03:15:26.806]  Then, Dr. Jill Biden.
[03:15:27.126 --> 03:15:28.767]  Then, an introduction from Ashley Biden.
[03:15:29.047 --> 03:15:30.649]  And then, the Honorable Joe Biden.
[03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:32.910]  So there's like a dozen people.
[03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:33.470]  You're right.
[03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:34.591]  They wanted to bury him.
[03:15:34.731 --> 03:15:34.931]  Yeah.
[03:15:34.951 --> 03:15:36.992]  No one's going to be watching at 11 or midnight.
[03:15:37.272 --> 03:15:38.473]  The prime time is 9 p.m.
[03:15:38.513 --> 03:15:40.894]  That's like ever since Larry King and before for 50 years.
[03:15:40.914 --> 03:15:42.375]  And no one's watching this to begin with.
[03:15:42.435 --> 03:15:44.996]  Other people just want to get an analysis of our enemies.
[03:15:46.212 --> 03:15:46.673]  Look at these.
[03:15:46.833 --> 03:15:48.355]  These are just a paid-off political class.
[03:15:48.395 --> 03:15:57.165]  I can't believe that they're gonna be able to keep that, with how aged that audience is, I can't believe they're gonna be able to keep people in the chairs in the actual room until midnight.
[03:15:57.245 --> 03:16:02.911]  I mean, people, like, if I go to a show with my dad, he's 75 years old, then it gets to be 10.30, like, we're leaving early.
[03:16:02.971 --> 03:16:04.213]  Like, he's just exhausted.
[03:16:04.313 --> 03:16:05.174]  My dad's the same way.
[03:16:05.214 --> 03:16:05.494]  You know?
[03:16:06.255 --> 03:16:08.156]  You know, my dad killed it almost killed him.
[03:16:08.196 --> 03:16:10.477]  But he even back then he want to leave by 10.
[03:16:10.777 --> 03:16:11.737]  Now he wants to leave at nine.
[03:16:11.917 --> 03:16:13.038]  Yeah, it was over for dinner.
[03:16:13.058 --> 03:16:13.938]  We dinner like six.
[03:16:13.958 --> 03:16:16.659]  We can hang out and yeah, he leaves at 8 30.
[03:16:16.959 --> 03:16:19.360]  The family joked that my dad goes to bed at 8 22 every night.
[03:16:19.640 --> 03:16:19.840]  Yeah.
[03:16:21.141 --> 03:16:23.202]  Well, so do I when I get a chance to.
[03:16:23.222 --> 03:16:25.283]  A lot of nights until two a.m.
[03:16:25.323 --> 03:16:26.223]  working, but you know.
[03:16:27.143 --> 03:16:28.104]  I was up till two a.m.
[03:16:28.144 --> 03:16:29.464]  last night working got up at six a.m.
[03:16:29.484 --> 03:16:29.464]  5 30.
[03:16:34.844 --> 03:16:35.524]  Look at these people.
[03:16:36.005 --> 03:16:38.205]  I mean, this guy is such a crook.
[03:16:38.806 --> 03:16:41.827]  I got interrogated by him in Congress, but they all kept it secret.
[03:16:42.447 --> 03:16:46.609]  I took the fifth 98 times because I said, you're a criminal, this is illegitimate.
[03:16:47.530 --> 03:16:48.150]  You and Schiff.
[03:16:49.050 --> 03:16:51.992]  And then they destroyed all the tapes and all the transcripts.
[03:16:52.492 --> 03:16:53.232]  No kidding.
[03:16:53.332 --> 03:16:56.934]  Not just me, of everything, because it showed what they did on January 6th.
[03:16:58.055 --> 03:17:00.456]  I mean, and just look at walls and all of them.
[03:17:00.496 --> 03:17:01.537]  These are dangerous people.
[03:17:01.897 --> 03:17:04.379]  So I joke around about them all day, folks, but it's not a laughing matter.
[03:17:05.039 --> 03:17:11.282]  Let's go back to the Devil Nation Command Center, DNC.
[03:17:11.323 --> 03:17:11.763]  Let's go.
[03:17:20.508 --> 03:17:22.209]  Well, compared to stuff, the RNC was great.
[03:17:22.509 --> 03:17:22.729]  Yes.
[03:17:22.909 --> 03:17:24.490]  I mean, this stuff's always boring.
[03:17:29.127 --> 03:17:33.449]  Better than like the 2004 New York RNC.
[03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:38.371]  Coach thinking like, we need to continue to attack other nations.
[03:17:38.411 --> 03:17:41.432]  We need to blow everyone up.
[03:17:44.493 --> 03:17:53.696]  One candidate worked at McDonald's while she was in college at an HBCU.
[03:17:56.914 --> 03:17:58.695]  Well, let's put her in charge of NASA.
[03:18:02.578 --> 03:18:07.921]  The other was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and helped his daddy in the family business.
[03:18:09.402 --> 03:18:10.863]  Housing discrimination, that is.
[03:18:12.993 --> 03:18:14.894]  Made up crap.
[03:18:15.114 --> 03:18:17.956]  And he raped a woman but was never arrested or convicted.
[03:18:17.976 --> 03:18:20.138]  25 years later the woman remembered it.
[03:18:20.858 --> 03:18:22.419]  Then all he said is he was innocent.
[03:18:22.439 --> 03:18:27.182]  They had two trials rigged in New York and charged him like 90 million dollars.
[03:18:31.465 --> 03:18:32.625]  Was locking up innocent people.
[03:18:39.372 --> 03:18:41.814]  Look how simple they have to make it for their audience.
[03:18:41.834 --> 03:18:42.775]  You know, I'm going to be honest.
[03:18:42.795 --> 03:18:43.775]  I'm going to make a call here.
[03:18:45.797 --> 03:18:46.838]  Because we've got Big Mike.
[03:18:47.138 --> 03:18:47.979]  I mean, let's look at what we got.
[03:18:48.099 --> 03:18:48.839]  Fade this down, folks.
[03:18:49.019 --> 03:18:49.740]  I can't listen to it.
[03:18:51.802 --> 03:18:55.705]  And we have, you know, decent viewers tuned in right now, and I appreciate everybody tuning in.
[03:18:56.645 --> 03:19:02.550]  But... I mean, we probably got two hours left of this, at least, probably.
[03:19:03.251 --> 03:19:07.453]  I would say it's going to go for another 60 to 120 minutes closer to 1 20.
[03:19:08.113 --> 03:19:10.154]  And then Tuesday, we got Obama.
[03:19:11.055 --> 03:19:11.575]  Big Mike.
[03:19:12.735 --> 03:19:16.137]  And Doug Emhoff and, uh, the.
[03:19:19.519 --> 03:19:22.780]  Child mutilation King Pritzker that needs to be covered.
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:25.081]  And Wednesday, Minnesota governor
[03:19:30.938 --> 03:19:32.259]  We're going to cover those nights.
[03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:34.160]  And who knows?
[03:19:34.180 --> 03:19:36.662]  Biden might not even show up tonight.
[03:19:36.682 --> 03:19:38.543]  This is obviously done on purpose.
[03:19:55.652 --> 03:19:56.653]  Let's let the crew vote.
[03:19:56.953 --> 03:19:57.714]  I'm not going to vote.
[03:19:58.154 --> 03:20:02.257]  I'm happy to stay here and do this, but I'm going to let the crew vote.
[03:20:02.277 --> 03:20:04.639]  You guys vote amongst yourselves right now.
[03:20:04.659 --> 03:20:04.699]  Uh.
[03:20:07.501 --> 03:20:09.723]  Don't call Rob doing the guys in the back in here.
[03:20:10.503 --> 03:20:12.264]  You guys all vote and then tell me the number.
[03:20:13.085 --> 03:20:19.130]  And then if it's if it's if it's a tiebreaker, we have the co host here and you can be the tiebreaker chase.
[03:20:19.190 --> 03:20:19.990]  OK, great.
[03:20:21.231 --> 03:20:22.092]  You guys gotta vote first.
[03:20:22.112 --> 03:20:22.592]  That's the deal.
[03:20:24.273 --> 03:20:24.874]  I'm down to stay.
[03:20:25.253 --> 03:20:26.053]  Are you masochists?
[03:20:26.913 --> 03:20:27.633]  You want to stay?
[03:20:27.653 --> 03:20:28.173]  Okay, okay.
[03:20:28.194 --> 03:20:30.094]  There's only six speakers left, man.
[03:20:30.834 --> 03:20:33.214]  Oh God, look, there's Ilhan Omar.
[03:20:34.595 --> 03:20:35.215]  I can't handle it.
[03:20:36.735 --> 03:20:37.295]  I'm not joking.
[03:20:37.375 --> 03:20:38.495]  I can't keep doing this, man.
[03:20:39.275 --> 03:20:40.496]  It is taxing.
[03:20:40.556 --> 03:20:41.596]  It's a heavy cross to bear.
[03:20:41.636 --> 03:20:43.476]  I mean, these people make me want to throw up.
[03:20:44.076 --> 03:20:45.957]  I mean, there's such liars.
[03:20:45.977 --> 03:20:48.317]  It's exhausting.
[03:20:48.457 --> 03:20:50.157]  Everything they say is a damn lie.
[03:20:50.177 --> 03:20:52.378]  Fine.
[03:20:52.918 --> 03:20:53.778]  You talk to everybody else.
[03:20:53.838 --> 03:20:54.578]  Everybody wants to stay.
[03:20:58.444 --> 03:21:00.046]  Now see that wrap it up at 10.
[03:21:01.067 --> 03:21:07.693]  That's that's a that's a that's a. OK, so no one could even get OK.
[03:21:08.333 --> 03:21:09.434]  I want an official vote.
[03:21:10.435 --> 03:21:13.118]  It's hard to get a real vote in America these days.
[03:21:15.500 --> 03:21:16.561]  Yeah, get paper ballots.
[03:21:16.781 --> 03:21:17.182]  You know what?
[03:21:18.303 --> 03:21:19.484]  Bring me a piece of paper.
[03:21:20.725 --> 03:21:22.487]  And we're gonna we're gonna I'm gonna.
[03:21:23.985 --> 03:21:48.535]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[03:21:52.667 --> 03:21:54.048]  Put this over on the edge right over there, Chase.
[03:21:54.088 --> 03:21:54.509]  There's a pen.
[03:21:54.529 --> 03:21:55.510]  All right.
[03:21:55.530 --> 03:21:58.152]  And then they'll just put an X on the stay or go.
[03:21:58.212 --> 03:21:58.432]  Let's go.
[03:21:58.452 --> 03:21:59.333]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:22:00.074 --> 03:22:00.434]  We want this.
[03:22:00.454 --> 03:22:02.055]  We're not going to cover up the windows like they do.
[03:22:02.075 --> 03:22:02.656]  Overhead shot.
[03:22:02.956 --> 03:22:03.597]  Overhead shot.
[03:22:04.117 --> 03:22:06.399]  Everyone wants it so everyone can see how everybody voted.
[03:22:06.639 --> 03:22:06.960]  Yeah.
[03:22:07.120 --> 03:22:07.520]  Okay.
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:07.961]  Right now.
[03:22:07.981 --> 03:22:09.002]  All right.
[03:22:09.022 --> 03:22:09.602]  We'll just do it over here.
[03:22:09.642 --> 03:22:10.423]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:22:12.024 --> 03:22:12.244]  Okay.
[03:22:12.264 --> 03:22:13.365]  So Rob Deuce says stay.
[03:22:13.445 --> 03:22:13.786]  Okay.
[03:22:14.126 --> 03:22:14.887]  Get in here, guys.
[03:22:16.189 --> 03:22:17.329]  Look at my incredible penmanship.
[03:22:17.369 --> 03:22:19.830]  You can tell I did really well in English class when it came to cards.
[03:22:20.611 --> 03:22:22.931]  Okay, so... Stay.
[03:22:22.951 --> 03:22:23.772]  Okay?
[03:22:24.272 --> 03:22:25.472]  We have one for staying.
[03:22:25.492 --> 03:22:25.872]  Alright?
[03:22:25.912 --> 03:22:27.113]  Let's bring everybody else in here.
[03:22:27.833 --> 03:22:28.733]  Come, McGreen, over here.
[03:22:29.093 --> 03:22:29.774]  Alright, go ahead.
[03:22:29.794 --> 03:22:31.154]  Okay?
[03:22:31.414 --> 03:22:32.775]  Because we gotta come back in here tomorrow.
[03:22:32.955 --> 03:22:33.195]  Okay?
[03:22:34.261 --> 03:22:34.581]  Look at that.
[03:22:34.621 --> 03:22:35.321]  You want to stay.
[03:22:35.462 --> 03:22:36.822]  All right, let's get in here, Ben.
[03:22:37.422 --> 03:22:37.802]  Come on.
[03:22:38.443 --> 03:22:39.283]  Do the wide shot.
[03:22:39.303 --> 03:22:40.283]  See this great looking crew here.
[03:22:40.303 --> 03:22:42.044]  Everybody who says go is looking at this employee.
[03:22:42.684 --> 03:22:43.505]  All right.
[03:22:43.685 --> 03:22:46.926]  No, I'm not voting because I'm the captain.
[03:22:46.966 --> 03:22:48.727]  This is a testament to the company culture.
[03:22:48.747 --> 03:22:52.308]  You know, on a pirate ship, the captain doesn't vote on something like this.
[03:22:52.468 --> 03:22:53.229]  The crew does.
[03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:55.590]  This is democracy.
[03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:57.230]  The first democracy up in Greece was ours.
[03:22:57.270 --> 03:23:00.212]  Okay, everybody, I think we're already got to stay here.
[03:23:00.232 --> 03:23:00.792]  Where's Daria?
[03:23:01.972 --> 03:23:02.552]  She's ready to go.
[03:23:02.592 --> 03:23:03.493]  She can leave if she needs to.
[03:23:03.513 --> 03:23:04.653]  She's got children to take care of.
[03:23:05.574 --> 03:23:06.514]  She's the lone female.
[03:23:06.554 --> 03:23:07.234]  You got to vote, Jones.
[03:23:08.075 --> 03:23:10.556]  Oh, and Owen's taking care of his... Okay, whatever.
[03:23:10.896 --> 03:23:11.817]  The point is Turtle.
[03:23:12.537 --> 03:23:16.719]  Anyways, the point is... Okay, is that everybody?
[03:23:16.759 --> 03:23:17.199]  You want to vote?
[03:23:17.219 --> 03:23:17.519]  I'll vote.
[03:23:17.779 --> 03:23:18.159]  I'll vote.
[03:23:18.199 --> 03:23:19.060]  Do it on camera.
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:19.460]  Don't cheat.
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:20.180]  You got to vote, too.
[03:23:23.562 --> 03:23:25.823]  Yeah, but they never... Daria, put yourself on air.
[03:23:26.463 --> 03:23:28.344]  They never follow the schedule.
[03:23:28.644 --> 03:23:29.725]  Nothing with them is the way it is.
[03:23:30.609 --> 03:23:31.430]  Well, I vote to go.
[03:23:34.374 --> 03:23:37.457]  I'm gonna vote the vote of sanity and go with Alex.
[03:23:37.858 --> 03:23:38.218]  Okay.
[03:23:38.238 --> 03:23:38.579]  That's a go.
[03:23:38.599 --> 03:23:40.681]  Alright, so this is democracy, folks.
[03:23:41.142 --> 03:23:41.302]  Good.
[03:23:41.980 --> 03:23:43.581]  And then there's going to make us walk the plankton.
[03:23:43.841 --> 03:23:46.263]  Yeah, you got the little ship in democracy.
[03:23:46.703 --> 03:23:50.306]  The majority can violate can violate the minorities, right?
[03:23:50.366 --> 03:23:51.246]  And you guys have the sword.
[03:23:51.306 --> 03:23:53.067]  You make us jump in the water.
[03:23:53.748 --> 03:23:54.468]  That's what's happening.
[03:23:55.929 --> 03:23:58.011]  Sign it, put it up for auction and for what this is.
[03:23:58.051 --> 03:23:59.112]  This is real art here.
[03:23:59.172 --> 03:24:00.552]  Ladies said democracy is done.
[03:24:00.572 --> 03:24:04.035]  Okay, should I stay or should I go?
[03:24:04.175 --> 03:24:06.276]  It's the most transparent election.
[03:24:06.296 --> 03:24:09.879]  We could turn a fan on and have white noise in here and people will be more soothed by it.
[03:24:13.633 --> 03:24:14.334]  That's what I'm gonna go.
[03:24:14.374 --> 03:24:15.095]  I love white noise.
[03:24:15.575 --> 03:24:16.376]  Yeah, I got a white noise.
[03:24:16.396 --> 03:24:17.757]  Would you say white noise is superior?
[03:24:17.838 --> 03:24:18.719]  I have two white noise.
[03:24:18.779 --> 03:24:19.760]  Oh, I guess I'm being racist.
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:22.482]  No, but white noise black screen when it's on my phone.
[03:24:23.183 --> 03:24:23.884]  Yeah, here we go.
[03:24:26.967 --> 03:24:27.868]  Oh my goodness.
[03:24:29.370 --> 03:24:29.890]  Oh boy.
[03:24:30.171 --> 03:24:30.631]  Oh man.
[03:24:31.091 --> 03:24:31.392]  You know what?
[03:24:31.432 --> 03:24:32.633]  Our coverage is better than theirs.
[03:24:33.774 --> 03:24:34.055]  Yeah.
[03:24:35.756 --> 03:24:36.157]  I think so.
[03:24:37.421 --> 03:24:37.881]  I don't know.
[03:24:37.901 --> 03:24:38.781]  CNN's been pretty good lately.
[03:24:38.841 --> 03:24:41.162]  Everywhere I look, it's like Kamala and Tim Walz.
[03:24:41.182 --> 03:24:45.243]  They're all like pedophiles and demons and crazy people.
[03:24:46.063 --> 03:24:49.364]  How many people have been accused of rape in that list?
[03:24:49.864 --> 03:24:50.464]  There's Joe.
[03:24:50.504 --> 03:24:51.205]  There's Bill.
[03:24:51.445 --> 03:24:53.985]  Hillary kind of counts because she defended rapists.
[03:24:55.526 --> 03:24:56.206]  And then Big Mike.
[03:24:57.186 --> 03:24:58.206]  Well, she raped America.
[03:24:58.226 --> 03:24:58.586]  Yeah.
[03:24:58.606 --> 03:24:59.427]  And raped Libya.
[03:24:59.447 --> 03:25:00.467]  I don't know.
[03:25:00.487 --> 03:25:02.507]  That Let's Move campaign is the reason I'm not obese.
[03:25:03.128 --> 03:25:04.168]  All right, let's go back.
[03:25:06.125 --> 03:25:07.706]  And let's listen to more of this lady.
[03:25:10.168 --> 03:25:10.988]  Who is this woman?
[03:25:11.549 --> 03:25:13.510]  This is Jasmine Crockett.
[03:25:13.570 --> 03:25:14.811]  Yeah, she's a representative from Texas.
[03:25:15.611 --> 03:25:19.594]  She's probably one of the ones that went on the plane to D.C.
[03:25:19.654 --> 03:25:21.035]  and asked for Dr. Pepper donations.
[03:25:21.955 --> 03:25:25.078]  Oh yeah, she's the one that's all ratchet with MTV.
[03:25:25.098 --> 03:25:25.418]  That's scary.
[03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:36.131]  Man, this is really hard to watch.
[03:25:36.251 --> 03:25:38.052]  Remember when we forced you to stay at work?
[03:25:38.072 --> 03:25:40.534]  Well, that's why I refuse to vote so I can leave.
[03:25:40.654 --> 03:25:45.036]  Dear Daria, she said we're leaving.
[03:25:45.056 --> 03:25:45.637]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:25:46.938 --> 03:25:50.920]  We're getting thrown off the boat here.
[03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:58.665]  The question before us is, will a vindictive vile villain violate voters' vision
[03:26:03.499 --> 03:26:04.019]  Hey, you know what?
[03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:05.480]  Let's go to X-Spaces.
[03:26:06.201 --> 03:26:06.981]  They've been really patient.
[03:26:07.001 --> 03:26:08.642]  Wait, Eric Bolling's been waiting?
[03:26:09.183 --> 03:26:09.423]  How long?
[03:26:09.503 --> 03:26:11.925]  You know, I was supposed to be on with him.
[03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:32.851]  Well, I apologize if he and others have been waiting.
[03:26:32.871 --> 03:26:34.191]  We just put it out as an audio feed.
[03:26:35.951 --> 03:26:37.252]  This is like, I'm torturing people.
[03:26:37.292 --> 03:26:38.012]  This is not fair.
[03:26:38.032 --> 03:26:41.633]  Well, Eric Bolling's been waiting.
[03:26:42.293 --> 03:26:43.233]  I'm just exhausted.
[03:26:44.074 --> 03:26:48.815]  And I've been up since 5.30, and I was supposed to be on with Bolling, but we never actually set it up properly.
[03:26:49.775 --> 03:26:51.316]  So I did not mean to ghost him on that.
[03:26:55.317 --> 03:26:56.197]  Yeah, this is evil.
[03:26:58.278 --> 03:26:58.998]  God bless y'all.
[03:27:01.974 --> 03:27:02.094]  Wow.
[03:27:02.114 --> 03:27:05.676]  Well, I'll give her this.
[03:27:05.696 --> 03:27:06.396]  She's a pretty lady.
[03:27:08.217 --> 03:27:09.197]  But her brain is rotten.
[03:27:10.678 --> 03:27:11.338]  She works for evil.
[03:27:13.019 --> 03:27:14.020]  Better get right with Jesus.
[03:27:15.881 --> 03:27:17.742]  This is one of our willow boxes.
[03:27:18.242 --> 03:27:22.464]  This is the outfit that she was gonna maybe wear home from the hospital.
[03:27:24.285 --> 03:27:24.985]  There's her willow.
[03:27:26.366 --> 03:27:27.886]  Was this a baby they weren't able to abort?
[03:27:28.747 --> 03:27:31.168]  The blanket that she was in.
[03:27:34.568 --> 03:27:35.128]  That's sad.
[03:27:35.148 --> 03:27:39.190]  I thought they were pro-abortion.
[03:27:39.250 --> 03:27:43.533]  For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it.
[03:27:43.913 --> 03:27:44.873]  And I'm proud to have done it.
[03:27:48.415 --> 03:27:54.518]  I was punished for three days having to wait for either my baby to die or me to die, or both.
[03:27:55.879 --> 03:28:03.003]  I was stuck in this horrific hell of both wanting to hear her heartbeat and also hoping I wouldn't.
[03:28:03.894 --> 03:28:05.495]  There has to be some form of punishment.
[03:28:05.515 --> 03:28:06.036]  For the woman?
[03:28:06.296 --> 03:28:08.337]  Yeah, there has to be some form.
[03:28:08.357 --> 03:28:13.141]  I almost died because doctors were forced to follow Trump's abortion ban.
[03:28:14.301 --> 03:28:16.463]  Kamala will protect a woman's right to choose.
[03:28:17.864 --> 03:28:26.710]  We trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do!
[03:28:27.171 --> 03:28:28.852]  I have so much faith in her.
[03:28:30.186 --> 03:28:38.732]  And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.
[03:28:40.033 --> 03:28:41.754]  We have to fight for Kamala Harris.
[03:28:42.114 --> 03:28:45.176]  Our rights, our freedoms, and frankly our lives.
[03:28:45.677 --> 03:28:47.058]  Everything is on the line.
[03:28:57.722 --> 03:29:01.946]  When you're expecting a baby, packing for the hospital should be a joyful moment.
[03:29:02.886 --> 03:29:04.768]  For us, it was different.
[03:29:06.069 --> 03:29:12.174]  We were told, with 100% certainty, we would lose our baby girl, Willow.
[03:29:13.275 --> 03:29:14.236]  And we were sent home.
[03:29:15.717 --> 03:29:23.324]  For three days, we waited until Amanda was sick enough to receive standard abortion care.
[03:29:24.918 --> 03:29:27.240]  Eventually, Amanda's temperature spiked.
[03:29:28.020 --> 03:29:31.683]  She was shaking, disoriented, and crashing.
[03:29:34.045 --> 03:29:42.932]  I don't remember what I threw into our bag that day, only that instead of welcoming Willow, I was hoping Amanda's life could be saved.
[03:29:46.035 --> 03:29:50.898]  I'm here tonight because the fight for reproductive rights isn't just a woman's fight.
[03:29:51.679 --> 03:29:52.760]  This is about fighting
[03:29:54.534 --> 03:29:56.696]  This is about fighting for our families.
[03:29:57.677 --> 03:30:00.560]  And as Kamala Harris says, our future.
[03:30:00.620 --> 03:30:04.024]  By the way, I couldn't tell they were running the set.
[03:30:04.064 --> 03:30:05.726]  I thought they lost a kid who was already born.
[03:30:05.746 --> 03:30:07.328]  I said, oh yeah, the Democrats have an abortion.
[03:30:08.839 --> 03:30:14.142]  This is a sad story right here, but they use these little case point examples to say, keep abortion.
[03:30:14.782 --> 03:30:16.103]  What about selling all the body parts?
[03:30:16.123 --> 03:30:17.864]  What about keeping them alive to the third trimester?
[03:30:18.224 --> 03:30:21.146]  Or even after they're born, like they do in Virginia and New York, and sell their body parts.
[03:30:21.766 --> 03:30:22.627]  That's not these people.
[03:30:22.667 --> 03:30:23.467]  They're not bad people.
[03:30:23.527 --> 03:30:30.511]  But on the other hand, we see what the biomedical system is doing with the poison shots, the kids, and the rest of it.
[03:30:32.059 --> 03:30:33.119]  All right, that's enough of this.
[03:30:33.860 --> 03:30:36.100]  Again, if you want to watch this crap, you can go find it somewhere.
[03:30:37.781 --> 03:30:42.702]  I just think we need to see the Big Mike theme song one more time because she's coming up tomorrow night.
[03:30:42.722 --> 03:30:45.683]  So let's get clip four, Big Mike theme song ready.
[03:30:45.703 --> 03:30:47.924]  And then we've got a Hillary Clinton remix.
[03:30:48.204 --> 03:30:49.164]  Let's play those.
[03:30:49.784 --> 03:30:53.345]  And then we've got clip six, Obama whipping taxpayers to pay for abortions.
[03:30:53.665 --> 03:30:55.046]  Play four, five, and six back to back.
[03:30:55.086 --> 03:30:55.406]  Here it is.
[03:31:00.780 --> 03:31:03.962]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[03:31:04.403 --> 03:31:06.764]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS.
[03:31:07.745 --> 03:31:10.067]  An Anaconda, Burrock's favorite pet.
[03:31:10.787 --> 03:31:13.549]  Gets him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[03:31:14.250 --> 03:31:16.591]  Joan Rivers said it's true.
[03:31:17.372 --> 03:31:19.614]  Under the dress it's become unglued.
[03:31:19.694 --> 03:31:23.576]  Put it back on now, Big Mike's gonna let it show.
[03:31:45.111 --> 03:31:47.332]  Yeah, it never gets old.
[03:31:47.372 --> 03:31:50.794]  But we've already seen it, so go ahead.
[03:31:51.594 --> 03:31:52.095]  He died.
[03:31:53.355 --> 03:31:54.316]  Killed about 200,000 people.
[03:31:54.336 --> 03:31:54.716]  So liberal.
[03:31:55.476 --> 03:31:59.358]  We killed 500,000 kids and a million in Iraq.
[03:31:59.478 --> 03:31:59.879]  It's good.
[03:32:01.119 --> 03:32:04.701]  Isn't it a violation of the Geneva Convention to assassinate?
[03:32:05.802 --> 03:32:07.963]  He's bragging about war crimes.
[03:32:20.414 --> 03:32:21.454]  Alright, that's enough of this.
[03:32:21.715 --> 03:32:24.177]  Let's skip to clip six.
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:32.723]  I need your money to kill babies by abortion!
[03:32:33.264 --> 03:32:34.285]  You, taxpayer!
[03:32:34.825 --> 03:32:37.167]  Give me your money to pay for baby killing!
[03:32:37.367 --> 03:32:37.647]  No!
[03:32:38.028 --> 03:32:39.409]  I don't believe in abortion!
[03:32:39.829 --> 03:32:40.490]  I don't care!
[03:32:40.510 --> 03:32:42.972]  Render to Caesar what to Caesar!
[03:32:43.872 --> 03:32:45.374]  Give me money to kill babies!
[03:32:46.701 --> 03:32:47.102]  Alright!
[03:32:47.202 --> 03:32:47.602]  Alright!
[03:32:47.662 --> 03:32:48.283]  I'll pay you!
[03:32:48.523 --> 03:32:49.704]  Don't hit me anymore!
[03:32:49.724 --> 03:32:50.685]  Please!
[03:32:50.926 --> 03:32:51.426]  Please!
[03:32:51.546 --> 03:32:52.607]  Kill my baby!
[03:32:52.928 --> 03:32:53.869]  Kill my baby!
[03:32:53.929 --> 03:32:54.189]  You!
[03:32:55.290 --> 03:32:56.552]  Kill that woman's baby!
[03:32:59.935 --> 03:33:00.135]  Yes!
[03:33:01.957 --> 03:33:02.418]  Yes!
[03:33:03.079 --> 03:33:03.299]  Yes!
[03:33:09.276 --> 03:33:11.317]  This is our town.
[03:33:11.337 --> 03:33:17.141]  We've got steel in our spines, iron in our veins, and hope in our hearts.
[03:33:18.381 --> 03:33:24.605]  We've got the flavor, the guts, the grit, and those big shoulders you've heard so much about.
[03:33:25.265 --> 03:33:33.270]  We're a bold city, a proud city, a who you calling second city, where 77 neighborhoods are one.
[03:33:34.022 --> 03:33:35.103]  A city of giants.
[03:33:35.343 --> 03:33:36.804]  A city with heart.
[03:33:37.365 --> 03:33:38.846]  A city with heroes.
[03:33:39.166 --> 03:33:41.488]  A sweet, sweet place to call home.
[03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:43.470]  We were born ready.
[03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:45.732]  Baptized by fire.
[03:33:45.932 --> 03:33:46.492]  Tireless.
[03:33:46.913 --> 03:33:47.553]  Tenacious.
[03:33:47.934 --> 03:33:48.654]  Tested.
[03:33:48.994 --> 03:33:49.395]  Trusted.
[03:33:50.513 --> 03:33:54.217]  And like someone else we know, when we fight, we win.
[03:33:55.078 --> 03:33:58.601]  We're ready to rise to the challenge, to rise to new heights.
[03:33:59.142 --> 03:34:03.807]  Rise, rise, rise, up, up, and away we go.
[03:34:04.327 --> 03:34:09.172]  Hey, make some noise so we can hear you, America!
[03:34:10.053 --> 03:34:13.116]  Welcome to Chicago!
[03:34:15.256 --> 03:34:21.901]  Okay, well, well, well, Rob, dude just made this and I'm just being told of this genius and it's not on my ex account, Alex Jones, right now.
[03:34:23.242 --> 03:34:23.463]  Come on.
[03:34:23.583 --> 03:34:25.104]  Oh my God, I've been reenergized.
[03:34:25.664 --> 03:34:28.446]  Kamala, we're not watching any more of them until Biden comes on her.
[03:34:28.466 --> 03:34:30.568]  Until his daughter, they shower together.
[03:34:30.608 --> 03:34:31.889]  You gotta watch Jill.
[03:34:32.830 --> 03:34:33.470]  Oh my God.
[03:34:33.570 --> 03:34:34.451]  Is she gonna wear fishnets?
[03:34:34.912 --> 03:34:41.597]  The point is, is that, is that Rob, dude, he just came in and said he made that genius work, that masterpiece.
[03:34:44.071 --> 03:34:45.092]  Oh, they just finished it.
[03:34:45.152 --> 03:34:47.295]  Well, that's very pleasing.
[03:34:47.915 --> 03:34:50.538]  So, what do we call that little genius jewel?
[03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:52.921]  Breaking!
[03:34:53.762 --> 03:34:57.386]  Kamala Harris releases powerful new presidential ad.
[03:34:58.967 --> 03:34:59.408]  I like it.
[03:34:59.908 --> 03:35:00.089]  Yeah.
[03:35:00.962 --> 03:35:10.768]  Or Kamala Harris advocates for Democratic cities or something about, you know, Democratic Kamala breaking Kamala Harris releases new presidential ad celebrating Democrat city.
[03:35:10.808 --> 03:35:11.888]  Yes, that's it.
[03:35:11.948 --> 03:35:12.248]  Yes.
[03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:19.793]  Kamala Harris exclusive or no breaking Kamala Harris releases powerful new presidential ad.
[03:35:20.353 --> 03:35:22.234]  Yeah, celebrating Democrat cities.
[03:35:22.274 --> 03:35:22.514]  Yeah.
[03:35:22.774 --> 03:35:22.954]  Yep.
[03:35:23.755 --> 03:35:25.016]  That was so good.
[03:35:26.250 --> 03:35:28.592]  Uh, I mean, something that good.
[03:35:28.612 --> 03:35:30.353]  Or would you rather hear from this guy here?
[03:35:30.373 --> 03:35:31.414]  Let's hear from this guy for a minute.
[03:35:31.454 --> 03:35:33.035]  This is this is gonna be riveting.
[03:35:33.076 --> 03:35:33.936]  I don't even know who this is.
[03:35:33.956 --> 03:35:37.639]  They're probably gonna talk about castrating children or something.
[03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:40.361]  We're a fruitcake cult.
[03:35:40.381 --> 03:35:41.162]  Is that Kinzinger?
[03:35:41.702 --> 03:35:41.982]  No.
[03:35:44.004 --> 03:35:44.945]  Boy, wouldn't that be rich?
[03:35:45.125 --> 03:35:47.707]  Gretzky's gonna be up there wobbling around tomorrow.
[03:35:55.598 --> 03:35:59.562]  Hadley Duvall is one of the bravest people I've ever met.
[03:36:00.062 --> 03:36:02.104]  Okay, I don't want to hear it.
[03:36:02.324 --> 03:36:04.005]  How many brave people you met, bro?
[03:36:04.866 --> 03:36:05.907]  Okay, let's just stop there.
[03:36:07.689 --> 03:36:09.290]  We're very pleased Kamala sent us this.
[03:36:09.310 --> 03:36:14.174]  This is the new official Harris Celebration of Blue Cities award video.
[03:36:14.615 --> 03:36:15.996]  Chicago wins the award.
[03:36:16.016 --> 03:36:20.140]  You know, New York and Seattle and
[03:36:22.383 --> 03:36:24.365]  What's that place in Oregon?
[03:36:24.945 --> 03:36:25.326]  Portland.
[03:36:25.406 --> 03:36:26.767]  Portland, yeah.
[03:36:26.847 --> 03:36:29.249]  In LA, they're all... San Francisco, they're all close seconds.
[03:36:29.850 --> 03:36:31.551]  But here it is, Chicago!
[03:36:31.751 --> 03:36:33.132]  Chicago, you win.
[03:36:39.918 --> 03:36:49.507]  Kind of like a... Hey guys, we're going to play Rob New's video again.
[03:36:50.666 --> 03:36:51.667]  We've been up here too long.
[03:36:51.747 --> 03:36:52.928]  Some of the crew's been here since 6 a.m.
[03:36:52.948 --> 03:36:54.009]  getting ready for Harrison's show.
[03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:59.354]  I want to play the video we just played that Rob dooded.
[03:36:59.375 --> 03:37:02.518]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:06.341]  This is our town.
[03:37:06.561 --> 03:37:12.828]  We've got steel in our spines, iron in our veins, and hope in our hearts.
[03:37:14.073 --> 03:37:20.221]  We've got the flavor, the guts, the grit, and those big shoulders you've heard so much about.
[03:37:20.962 --> 03:37:28.953]  We are Bold City, a proud city, a who you calling second city, where 77 neighborhoods are one.
[03:37:29.702 --> 03:37:30.783]  A city of giants.
[03:37:31.003 --> 03:37:32.504]  A city with heart.
[03:37:33.064 --> 03:37:34.525]  A city with heroes.
[03:37:34.845 --> 03:37:37.087]  A sweet, sweet place to call home.
[03:37:38.067 --> 03:37:39.148]  We were born ready.
[03:37:39.708 --> 03:37:41.209]  Baptized by fire.
[03:37:41.610 --> 03:37:42.170]  Tireless.
[03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:43.231]  Tenacious.
[03:37:43.611 --> 03:37:44.551]  Tested.
[03:37:44.672 --> 03:37:45.072]  Trusted.
[03:37:46.198 --> 03:37:49.860]  And like someone else we know, when we fight, we win.
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:54.262]  We're ready to rise to the challenge, to rise to new heights.
[03:37:54.822 --> 03:37:59.485]  Rise, rise, rise, up, up, and away we go.
[03:38:00.005 --> 03:38:04.828]  Hey, make some noise so we can hear you, America!
[03:38:05.728 --> 03:38:08.810]  Welcome to Chicago!
[03:38:12.899 --> 03:38:13.359]  Wow.
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:17.121]  And Darren McGreen put that together with Derek and others.
[03:38:17.201 --> 03:38:17.762]  Good job.
[03:38:17.782 --> 03:38:19.523]  Really, really proud of that.
[03:38:20.003 --> 03:38:21.624]  Here, let's go back to watching paint dry.
[03:38:21.644 --> 03:38:23.085]  Let's hear from this bozo some more.
[03:38:23.545 --> 03:38:25.106]  That's not inconvenient.
[03:38:25.446 --> 03:38:27.307]  It's just plain wrong.
[03:38:35.017 --> 03:38:45.944]  And a woman grieving a non-viable pregnancy shouldn't be required to carry it to term just to listen to her child die or to hear no sound at all.
[03:38:46.084 --> 03:38:46.884]  How small his hands are.
[03:38:47.385 --> 03:38:51.387]  You know, all women should have the freedom to make their own decisions.
[03:38:51.407 --> 03:38:55.970]  They have, but again, they want to sell the babies.
[03:38:56.010 --> 03:38:57.591]  They want to keep them after they're even born.
[03:38:57.871 --> 03:38:58.211]  Right.
[03:38:58.371 --> 03:38:59.532]  About dehumanization.
[03:38:59.552 --> 03:39:02.894]  Remember, they're the ones telling you not to have kids.
[03:39:04.363 --> 03:39:05.944]  And the kids that survived, they want to cut them up.
[03:39:06.525 --> 03:39:07.365]  Transgender surgeries.
[03:39:07.906 --> 03:39:10.928]  How we treat people transcends party lines.
[03:39:11.488 --> 03:39:14.311]  It goes right to the heart of who we are.
[03:39:14.331 --> 03:39:15.211]  I can't listen to it.
[03:39:15.251 --> 03:39:15.752]  Turn it off.
[03:39:15.892 --> 03:39:17.073]  Maybe he was going to make a good point.
[03:39:19.835 --> 03:39:20.896]  Okay, Chase, let's hear it.
[03:39:21.076 --> 03:39:22.017]  I'm just kidding, man.
[03:39:23.556 --> 03:39:23.776]  I know.
[03:39:24.137 --> 03:39:24.837]  Now let's hear from him.
[03:39:24.857 --> 03:39:25.338]  Go ahead.
[03:39:25.438 --> 03:39:33.345]  So I want anyone watching tonight, Republican, Independent, Democrat, to know that you are welcome here.
[03:39:33.465 --> 03:39:36.688]  Does anyone believe these people are getting more than 20%, 30% of the votes?
[03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:38.110]  They're hated everywhere.
[03:39:39.226 --> 03:39:40.947]  And they all look like the Adams family.
[03:39:41.547 --> 03:39:55.436]  We believe in an America where we live out our values, end anger politics once and for all, and move beyond this us versus them by remembering we are all Americans.
[03:39:55.456 --> 03:39:57.917]  Including the illegal aliens you want to vote.
[03:39:59.598 --> 03:40:05.922]  We got the co-chairman of the campaign, Governor Whitmer, saying, oh yeah, let the illegal aliens vote, get driver's licenses, have everything free.
[03:40:07.046 --> 03:40:08.967]  Dude, his hands are freakishly small.
[03:40:08.987 --> 03:40:09.407]  Look at that.
[03:40:09.447 --> 03:40:10.088]  Like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[03:40:10.468 --> 03:40:10.768]  High heels.
[03:40:10.788 --> 03:40:12.809]  I know this, I would have him babysit my kids.
[03:40:12.829 --> 03:40:13.450]  Oh my god.
[03:40:30.674 --> 03:40:32.276]  Who is this moron?
[03:40:32.936 --> 03:40:34.218]  Who is this miserable person?
[03:40:34.238 --> 03:40:34.999]  You wanna take some speakers?
[03:40:35.379 --> 03:40:35.699]  Sure.
[03:40:50.501 --> 03:40:57.506]  And we're going to win by staying true to our values of compassion, empathy, and doing right by our neighbors.
[03:40:57.566 --> 03:40:59.427]  I'm so proud to be all in.
[03:40:59.748 --> 03:41:00.768]  What happened?
[03:41:00.788 --> 03:41:03.070]  What happened is his mother married her son.
[03:41:03.090 --> 03:41:10.315]  His dad was his uncle.
[03:41:10.475 --> 03:41:12.997]  Tell you what, he wouldn't win the gold in the women's boxing, that's for sure.
[03:41:19.517 --> 03:41:21.539]  Well, Tyrannosaurus Rex was a carrion eater.
[03:41:22.039 --> 03:41:25.902]  Would bend over to eat and see the little hands to pick through the meat.
[03:41:26.003 --> 03:41:26.143]  Right.
[03:41:26.323 --> 03:41:28.164]  Big legs, back legs to run and chase his prey fast.
[03:41:28.345 --> 03:41:28.625]  Right.
[03:41:31.828 --> 03:41:32.808]  This guy looks familiar.
[03:41:33.709 --> 03:41:34.650]  Senator, what's his face?
[03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:35.070]  Warnock.
[03:41:35.090 --> 03:41:35.571]  Warnock, yeah.
[03:41:39.754 --> 03:41:42.917]  This is like the first person I recognize other than AOC and Hillary tonight.
[03:41:45.399 --> 03:41:46.020]  Whoa!
[03:41:51.397 --> 03:41:52.518]  At least his suit looks good.
[03:41:53.619 --> 03:41:55.580]  Yeah, well, you know, your taxes paid for it.
[03:42:00.164 --> 03:42:02.066]  Okay, I can't handle this anymore.
[03:42:02.086 --> 03:42:02.506]  Turn it down.
[03:42:04.148 --> 03:42:04.928]  I'm gonna have to leave.
[03:42:06.650 --> 03:42:07.991]  We're so close to the end, man.
[03:42:08.631 --> 03:42:09.892]  How many more?
[03:42:11.253 --> 03:42:11.674]  How many?
[03:42:11.814 --> 03:42:12.174]  I don't know.
[03:42:12.214 --> 03:42:12.535]  Hold on.
[03:42:13.015 --> 03:42:13.916]  I'll find out right now.
[03:42:14.036 --> 03:42:14.596]  Give me a second.
[03:42:14.957 --> 03:42:16.218]  My life's too short for this.
[03:42:17.642 --> 03:42:20.103]  How about we just let the crew stay home this week and just screw this?
[03:42:20.984 --> 03:42:24.265]  All right, this is Warnock.
[03:42:24.285 --> 03:42:28.067]  We just got Chris Coons, then Jill, then Ashley with instruction and then Joe.
[03:42:28.207 --> 03:42:29.327]  I gotta see Ashley.
[03:42:29.547 --> 03:42:29.767]  Yeah.
[03:42:30.008 --> 03:42:31.668]  Will she come out in a shower robe?
[03:42:37.571 --> 03:42:39.112]  Maybe she'll read her diary out loud.
[03:42:39.492 --> 03:42:40.292]  Oh my God.
[03:42:40.352 --> 03:42:42.033]  She did verify on tape that it was hers.
[03:42:43.915 --> 03:42:45.776]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[03:42:45.896 --> 03:42:47.477]  I think they're going to be done by 1030, Jones.
[03:42:47.517 --> 03:42:47.877]  I really do.
[03:42:47.938 --> 03:42:48.278]  Okay.
[03:42:48.458 --> 03:42:49.939]  They're going to be done by 1030.
[03:42:49.999 --> 03:42:51.319]  I want to just commend the listeners.
[03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:52.100]  They deserve medals.
[03:42:54.481 --> 03:42:55.622]  Can we do some X's, people?
[03:42:55.862 --> 03:42:56.943]  Yeah, let's go to Alex Stone.
[03:42:56.983 --> 03:42:58.484]  Alex Stone, you've been waiting as a speaker.
[03:42:58.524 --> 03:42:59.204]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[03:42:59.224 --> 03:43:00.505]  Oh, that's the nephew of Roger Stone.
[03:43:00.565 --> 03:43:01.485]  Yeah, good guy.
[03:43:01.726 --> 03:43:02.346]  Absolutely.
[03:43:02.406 --> 03:43:04.287]  Yes, this is the nephew of Roger Stone.
[03:43:04.487 --> 03:43:06.949]  I'm having a terrible time listening to this.
[03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:10.391]  Wait a minute, you're not enjoying this?
[03:43:11.741 --> 03:43:12.501]  No, not at all.
[03:43:12.621 --> 03:43:14.102]  Not in any way, shape or form.
[03:43:14.242 --> 03:43:14.842]  It's miserable.
[03:43:16.703 --> 03:43:19.084]  It's so, so low energy, so boring.
[03:43:19.184 --> 03:43:20.905]  All of them are lying about Donald Trump.
[03:43:21.385 --> 03:43:23.406]  All of them are lying about Donald Trump's family.
[03:43:23.986 --> 03:43:29.468]  And I really, I just, I miss being at the RNC because there was so much hope.
[03:43:29.508 --> 03:43:30.529]  There was so much energy.
[03:43:30.569 --> 03:43:31.849]  There was so much life there.
[03:43:32.629 --> 03:43:35.811]  And it's just everything the opposite at the DNC.
[03:43:35.951 --> 03:43:37.351]  It's so, so sad.
[03:43:38.092 --> 03:43:41.273]  It's almost like they don't have any support, but they've got control of the voting machines.
[03:43:42.298 --> 03:43:42.498]  Yeah.
[03:43:43.038 --> 03:43:43.979]  Something like that, yeah.
[03:43:44.219 --> 03:43:47.180]  Like when you're the rich kid and your parents pay for people to come to your birthday party?
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:49.921]  There's like no joy.
[03:43:50.541 --> 03:43:50.781]  Yeah.
[03:43:53.702 --> 03:43:56.023]  Well, Alex, anything else?
[03:43:58.184 --> 03:44:03.446]  You know, I'm so bored that I've actually fallen asleep twice to this.
[03:44:05.187 --> 03:44:05.847]  It's terrible.
[03:44:06.227 --> 03:44:08.528]  I do, I just, I don't know.
[03:44:08.588 --> 03:44:11.409]  Honestly, it's almost better than good night's sleep, InfoWarsMD.
[03:44:12.449 --> 03:44:13.909]  Well, yeah, unless you want to kill yourself.
[03:44:15.010 --> 03:44:17.171]  Well, then you've got to get better mood plots to counteract it.
[03:44:17.191 --> 03:44:17.971]  Plus, you've got Hillary.
[03:44:17.991 --> 03:44:28.914]  You know, when she comes out, that's when, you know... Alex... I thankfully missed Hillary Clinton talk because, you know, I hate hearing her speak.
[03:44:29.535 --> 03:44:31.855]  She's so goddamn obnoxious.
[03:44:32.396 --> 03:44:33.396]  She is, and here's my deal.
[03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:40.613]  I could have acted like it was exciting and sit here and I just have to admit when something's horrible, but has our feed been a little better than watching just them?
[03:44:40.633 --> 03:44:42.755]  We've had some real nuggets here for you.
[03:44:43.916 --> 03:44:44.156]  Yes.
[03:44:44.536 --> 03:44:47.338]  Would you like to see the Michelle Obama theme song again?
[03:44:48.999 --> 03:44:49.699]  I would love that.
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:51.861]  That would make me feel so much better.
[03:44:51.901 --> 03:44:53.262]  We actually had a legitimate vote.
[03:44:54.147 --> 03:44:57.728]  Yeah, thank you for the, uh, excellent speaking there, Mr. Stone.
[03:44:58.529 --> 03:44:59.529]  Let's go to the next person.
[03:44:59.829 --> 03:45:01.970]  Alright, let's go to Timothy Lassley, diehard fan.
[03:45:02.210 --> 03:45:04.030]  Timothy, go ahead and unmute yourself, say what you gotta say.
[03:45:05.351 --> 03:45:07.312]  Hey, uh, Alex, how's it going?
[03:45:07.332 --> 03:45:09.512]  You're, actually, by jokes, you're pretty savage.
[03:45:09.672 --> 03:45:11.273]  It's pretty drastic when I...
[03:45:12.745 --> 03:45:14.045]  Chase, of course, brother.
[03:45:14.065 --> 03:45:15.386]  I love you, man.
[03:45:15.406 --> 03:45:17.807]  Noah, I love you, man.
[03:45:18.307 --> 03:45:19.327]  I love your broadcasts.
[03:45:19.407 --> 03:45:21.788]  You've been coming up with some savage broadcasts lately.
[03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:22.268]  He has been.
[03:45:22.308 --> 03:45:25.429]  So what do you make of this thing we're watching?
[03:45:26.749 --> 03:45:31.931]  Well, it's like Alex was saying, Alex Stone, it's very low energy.
[03:45:32.151 --> 03:45:36.852]  And then compound that with the fact that this is what we're facing as a civilization.
[03:45:36.932 --> 03:45:40.113]  This is this low energy mob of corruption.
[03:45:41.457 --> 03:45:55.725]  If it was up to Alex Jones without the media attachments and the lawyers and the lawsuits, how would you peacefully form some sort of activist group to stop this?
[03:45:55.745 --> 03:45:58.286]  Because this is so pathetic that we have to deal with this.
[03:45:58.346 --> 03:46:02.008]  And I've been wordgaming this out as much as you have, unfortunately.
[03:46:02.048 --> 03:46:03.389]  I've been in the streets forever.
[03:46:03.509 --> 03:46:07.271]  For those who don't know, you go on the Bullhorn Bill Gates Foundation and a bunch of other great work.
[03:46:08.909 --> 03:46:12.474]  I was there today, bullhorning the Robert Malone interview that you were doing.
[03:46:12.494 --> 03:46:14.217]  I was about 20 minutes behind your live feed.
[03:46:15.454 --> 03:46:19.036]  Um, but yeah, um, but how do we get out of this low energy?
[03:46:19.096 --> 03:46:24.919]  Well, you know, I built a media operation and reached, you know, billions and billions and billions and, you know, probably 20 billion views over the years.
[03:46:24.979 --> 03:46:27.180]  And, you know, it's all part of information warfare.
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:32.783]  We're taking back our local cities, counties, states, realizing the Democrats are globalist cancer, taking over the Republican Party.
[03:46:33.103 --> 03:46:34.084]  We've got that about 70% done.
[03:46:34.284 --> 03:46:43.989]  It's just the process, you know, and it's all promoting each other and supporting each other and just not letting these people gaslight us and staying peaceful at the same time because they they're losing worldwide.
[03:46:45.555 --> 03:46:51.736]  You said taking back our towns, and so we did the Million Man March, right?
[03:46:51.856 --> 03:46:55.537]  And then the Million MAGA March, and why not the Million Town March?
[03:46:55.597 --> 03:46:59.638]  Why not just a decentralized where the feds can't just ransack the whole world?
[03:46:59.658 --> 03:47:08.020]  Because, like, the First Amendment is still alive, but everybody is so scared, or you're so cucked with apathy and excuses that they're just not doing it.
[03:47:08.040 --> 03:47:09.800]  But yet I see the left owning the space.
[03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:13.522]  I mean, this is the story of good and evil, and there's a process, and there's a cycle.
[03:47:13.923 --> 03:47:14.723]  These are cyclical.
[03:47:14.763 --> 03:47:15.484]  God bless you, sir.
[03:47:15.524 --> 03:47:16.424]  Thank you for all you do.
[03:47:16.945 --> 03:47:17.545]  Yeah, love you, Tim.
[03:47:17.725 --> 03:47:20.147]  Let's go to Modern Warfare with Alex Jones.
[03:47:20.187 --> 03:47:22.088]  So I have invited Modern Warfare to speak.
[03:47:22.108 --> 03:47:22.868]  He has yet to explain.
[03:47:22.888 --> 03:47:23.549]  Oh, he's just listening.
[03:47:23.589 --> 03:47:23.709]  Okay.
[03:47:23.729 --> 03:47:25.230]  He's just listening, but we can go straight to Cole.
[03:47:25.270 --> 03:47:26.491]  Cole's had his hand raised for some time.
[03:47:26.551 --> 03:47:27.531]  Cole, go ahead and unmute yourself.
[03:47:29.553 --> 03:47:30.353]  Hey, can y'all hear me, guys?
[03:47:30.674 --> 03:47:31.054]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:47:32.487 --> 03:47:32.947]  Oh, right.
[03:47:33.107 --> 03:47:33.948]  Awesome.
[03:47:34.028 --> 03:47:35.549]  Nice talking to you, Alex and Chase.
[03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:38.651]  Really enjoyed the discussion we had about that airplane earlier.
[03:47:38.671 --> 03:47:46.935]  But anyways, man, I don't know how anybody's getting through this without some alcohol or like something just to keep going.
[03:47:47.015 --> 03:47:52.018]  I mean, my goodness, this has just been an absolute train wreck.
[03:47:52.158 --> 03:47:59.823]  I mean, I feel like I got needles, hot needles driving into my skull, the level of headache that I got right now from this whole thing.
[03:47:59.903 --> 03:48:00.283]  It's just
[03:48:00.996 --> 03:48:01.737]  This is painful.
[03:48:02.998 --> 03:48:04.779]  Tell me, we should host a vote.
[03:48:04.799 --> 03:48:06.620]  Maybe we just shouldn't cover this this week.
[03:48:08.222 --> 03:48:15.147]  I mean, I mean, look, Alex, you know, the RNC, yeah, had his moments, but at least you could get through that, you know, sanely and sober.
[03:48:15.207 --> 03:48:21.832]  But this, I mean, Hillary and you got Jasmine looking all slicked up and AOC dancing like a schoolgirl.
[03:48:21.912 --> 03:48:23.313]  I mean, oh, my goodness.
[03:48:23.814 --> 03:48:25.535]  This is just incredible.
[03:48:25.555 --> 03:48:28.197]  This is like handing out a box of razor blades to commit mass suicide.
[03:48:28.457 --> 03:48:29.018]  Oh, my God.
[03:48:31.288 --> 03:48:32.029]  Oh, you ain't kidding.
[03:48:32.109 --> 03:48:33.509]  They're literally serving Kool-Aid.
[03:48:33.569 --> 03:48:35.990]  Yeah, they're going to serve the Kool-Aid out there.
[03:48:36.871 --> 03:48:38.352]  Look at the trade seals out there!
[03:48:38.412 --> 03:48:39.572]  I mean, they're all on the Kool-Aid.
[03:48:39.592 --> 03:48:40.272]  Are you kidding me?
[03:48:40.292 --> 03:48:42.233]  They're all jumping around all happy and stuff.
[03:48:42.273 --> 03:48:43.774]  I mean, all 2,000 of them, of course.
[03:48:43.834 --> 03:48:47.796]  I mean, they filmed the arena for only 10K, but, you know, they're going to get 2K in there.
[03:48:47.816 --> 03:48:48.776]  I mean, geez.
[03:48:50.717 --> 03:48:51.738]  Just dead.
[03:48:52.978 --> 03:48:57.040]  Just to think that there are people out there that are going to... By the way, that's a real photo of Big Mike.
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:48:58.201]  That's not a woman, folks.
[03:48:58.766 --> 03:48:59.247]  That's real.
[03:48:59.267 --> 03:49:00.630]  She doesn't obviously own an iron.
[03:49:10.780 --> 03:49:11.200]  I don't know.
[03:49:11.220 --> 03:49:14.302]  60% chance that Jill Biden walks out in fishnets.
[03:49:14.322 --> 03:49:16.703]  Yeah, and you really think Big Mike's Big Mike?
[03:49:17.403 --> 03:49:18.544]  Yeah, no, I really think it's a man.
[03:49:19.064 --> 03:49:19.404]  Wow.
[03:49:19.724 --> 03:49:24.867]  Dude, those are all real videos coming out of Harvard and on TV when it pops out and goes untucked.
[03:49:24.887 --> 03:49:30.109]  It's like a big, I mean, you know, I mean, flaccid 8-inch dong.
[03:49:30.729 --> 03:49:35.832]  I mean, I mean, I mean, if Michelle Obama was in porn, she'd probably have the largest penis ever recorded.
[03:49:40.675 --> 03:49:41.356]  Wow, man.
[03:49:41.436 --> 03:49:43.618]  I always thought that it was just a troll because it's fine.
[03:49:43.818 --> 03:49:44.539]  No, no.
[03:49:44.699 --> 03:49:45.920]  The stage name would be Big Mike.
[03:49:48.582 --> 03:49:49.183]  I mean, yeah.
[03:49:51.084 --> 03:49:51.365]  There you go.
[03:49:51.385 --> 03:49:52.606]  I mean, look at that.
[03:49:52.926 --> 03:49:55.608]  Go back to them coming out of Harvard when they were checking their daughters in.
[03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:57.390]  Go back and slow roll that.
[03:49:57.410 --> 03:50:04.316]  Now that's, that's, that, you know, your Ataconda ain't got nothing, son.
[03:50:04.336 --> 03:50:05.917]  Why do you wear clothes like that?
[03:50:05.977 --> 03:50:07.499]  Guys, can we pull up Sir Mix-A-Lot?
[03:50:09.363 --> 03:50:10.223]  Forget the exact line.
[03:50:10.243 --> 03:50:12.024]  Why would you wear clothes like that to accentuate it?
[03:50:12.144 --> 03:50:13.344]  You think you'd tape that thing up?
[03:50:13.584 --> 03:50:14.285]  It pops out.
[03:50:14.305 --> 03:50:15.585]  That's what it does.
[03:50:15.665 --> 03:50:16.905]  It's a mind of its own.
[03:50:20.066 --> 03:50:21.707]  You're packing artillery like Big Mike.
[03:50:23.127 --> 03:50:24.828]  Old-fashioned artillery.
[03:50:25.328 --> 03:50:26.849]  Old-fashioned artillery.
[03:50:27.009 --> 03:50:27.989]  Genius.
[03:50:29.249 --> 03:50:30.390]  I can't watch this anymore.
[03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:31.670]  I can't look at Kamala.
[03:50:31.970 --> 03:50:34.551]  The smugness and the dumbness of it at the same time.
[03:50:35.231 --> 03:50:35.931]  Sir, are you still there?
[03:50:37.212 --> 03:50:37.552]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:38.376 --> 03:50:41.898]  Okay, I apologize that I'm making so many jokes, but this is really hard to watch.
[03:50:42.298 --> 03:50:43.979]  Oh, no, I'm enjoying this, man.
[03:50:44.019 --> 03:50:47.661]  This is the only reason why I think, I mean, come on, 247,000 viewers?
[03:50:48.202 --> 03:50:51.704]  Like, you're keeping everybody up.
[03:50:51.944 --> 03:50:53.425]  I appreciate you.
[03:50:53.465 --> 03:50:54.505]  Let's move on to the next person.
[03:50:54.525 --> 03:50:57.247]  Hey, we got Modern Warfare is live and on the air.
[03:50:57.287 --> 03:50:57.968]  Go ahead, Modern.
[03:50:59.368 --> 03:51:00.629]  What's up, Alex and Chase?
[03:51:01.029 --> 03:51:01.910]  Good to talk to you.
[03:51:03.012 --> 03:51:06.835]  Sorry, I just tuned in, so I've been working all day.
[03:51:06.875 --> 03:51:08.217]  Well, you're lucky you've been missing this.
[03:51:08.237 --> 03:51:10.318]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:51:11.119 --> 03:51:13.081]  I think this is a portal to hell.
[03:51:13.161 --> 03:51:14.942]  It's like watching Schindler's List.
[03:51:15.083 --> 03:51:17.064]  This is like looking into a portal of hell.
[03:51:18.546 --> 03:51:20.808]  Well, I'll be streaming it to people later, so...
[03:51:21.895 --> 03:51:24.076]  Well, hey, you do a lot of good work, and I appreciate your work.
[03:51:24.156 --> 03:51:25.536]  It's good to hear a voice to it.
[03:51:27.057 --> 03:51:30.238]  Are you excited to see Ashley Biden introduce daddy?
[03:51:31.658 --> 03:51:31.938]  Yeah.
[03:51:32.439 --> 03:51:32.659]  Yeah.
[03:51:32.859 --> 03:51:35.780]  Let's see if she comes out in that bathrobe like you're talking about.
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:37.420]  I wonder if he's going to smell her, too.
[03:51:39.841 --> 03:51:41.662]  I'm surprised he's allowed within 300 feet of her.
[03:51:41.882 --> 03:51:42.202]  Yeah.
[03:51:43.562 --> 03:51:43.962]  Yeah.
[03:51:45.363 --> 03:51:47.844]  Why do you think it is that she's covering for him after all this?
[03:51:48.284 --> 03:51:48.424]  Why?
[03:51:48.464 --> 03:51:49.204]  Like, is it stock?
[03:51:49.224 --> 03:51:50.665]  They know that's a weak point for them all.
[03:51:51.145 --> 03:51:51.285]  Yeah.
[03:51:53.632 --> 03:51:54.953]  Well, Modern Warfare, anything else?
[03:51:56.995 --> 03:51:59.457]  No, I'm good, man.
[03:51:59.477 --> 03:52:00.658]  You do a lot of good work.
[03:52:00.838 --> 03:52:01.198]  Thank you.
[03:52:01.398 --> 03:52:01.979]  Great videos.
[03:52:02.019 --> 03:52:02.559]  Thanks, Modern.
[03:52:02.579 --> 03:52:03.100]  Poor people.
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:05.301]  All right, let's go to RCP.
[03:52:05.602 --> 03:52:07.163]  RCP, go ahead and unmute yourself.
[03:52:08.899 --> 03:52:09.200]  Yeah.
[03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:11.721]  Hey, look, I listen to all you guys.
[03:52:11.841 --> 03:52:12.402]  Love your shows.
[03:52:12.422 --> 03:52:13.923]  I've been listening for a long time.
[03:52:14.443 --> 03:52:17.145]  I'm also a fellow in full war store.
[03:52:17.786 --> 03:52:18.166]  Thank you.
[03:52:18.186 --> 03:52:18.666]  Awesome.
[03:52:18.806 --> 03:52:19.907]  You know, supporter.
[03:52:20.167 --> 03:52:21.208]  Yeah.
[03:52:21.548 --> 03:52:30.475]  You know, the one thing that I've heard Chase, I've heard Harrison, I've heard you Jones talk about this is, you know, what, what's there going to be, what, what's there
[03:52:31.375 --> 03:52:33.918]  It's Trump robs poor people and rapes women, yeah!
[03:52:34.098 --> 03:52:38.482]  And he hurts the jobs, and he's bad for inflation, and we'll fix it.
[03:52:38.522 --> 03:52:39.983]  You know, we've been in for four years.
[03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:55.311]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[03:52:55.512 --> 03:53:00.942]  You're still... I mean, she is more of the acting president right now than anybody else at this point.
[03:53:00.982 --> 03:53:02.825]  So, who's buying this?
[03:53:04.893 --> 03:53:06.094]  I mean, who's buying that?
[03:53:06.114 --> 03:53:08.655]  They only need to sell the idea that she can plausibly win.
[03:53:08.675 --> 03:53:11.457]  I mean, she's really 20 points behind nationally.
[03:53:11.477 --> 03:53:13.278]  10 to 15 battlegrounds.
[03:53:13.298 --> 03:53:18.481]  I mean, this is a bigger landslide than Trump got in 2016 that was able to override their fraud.
[03:53:19.241 --> 03:53:20.822]  But that's why they tried to kill him.
[03:53:20.882 --> 03:53:25.025]  I mean, they wouldn't try to kill him if they thought they could win.
[03:53:27.512 --> 03:53:29.573]  Well, you know what the saddest part is?
[03:53:29.893 --> 03:53:30.874]  I'm from Chicago.
[03:53:30.894 --> 03:53:32.894]  I was born and raised there.
[03:53:32.934 --> 03:53:35.075]  My first 23 years of my life, I lived there.
[03:53:36.016 --> 03:53:38.217]  And I was a Democrat for a very long time.
[03:53:39.077 --> 03:53:46.300]  Obviously, I voted for Trump in 16 and on, but I still have some close friends that are there.
[03:53:46.961 --> 03:53:53.864]  You've mentioned this a few times in your rant and whatnot, but I mean,
[03:53:54.756 --> 03:54:00.548]  Like, you know, there's a certain point to where you can convince somebody of something or they're just not going to hear it.
[03:54:01.372 --> 03:54:04.995]  Well, that said, these are weak-minded people that are in the Democratic Party.
[03:54:05.375 --> 03:54:06.336]  Statistics show that.
[03:54:07.096 --> 03:54:08.958]  Many more times likely to steal, lie.
[03:54:08.998 --> 03:54:10.959]  I mean, it's a fact about leftists.
[03:54:11.580 --> 03:54:18.285]  And so they think they're part of a ruling class, even though on average, the average Democrat voter is low-income.
[03:54:18.365 --> 03:54:24.810]  But the Democrat rulers are the richest, most powerful people in America and per capita in the world.
[03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:30.054]  Again, 90-plus percent, 95-plus percent of all the corporate donations go to them.
[03:54:31.095 --> 03:54:32.356]  In the presidential race against Trump.
[03:54:32.376 --> 03:54:34.138]  It's not normally like that.
[03:54:34.158 --> 03:54:36.301]  Usually it's 60, 70% go Democrat, 30% Republican.
[03:54:36.942 --> 03:54:38.283]  But I mean, they're all against Trump.
[03:54:38.323 --> 03:54:38.984]  What's that tell you?
[03:54:39.004 --> 03:54:41.728]  It's not that he's perfect, but the power structure does not like Trump.
[03:54:42.128 --> 03:54:46.634]  So for them to get up there and go, he's the man, his daddy had money, and he made Trump work hard.
[03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:49.271]  And Trump works very hard.
[03:54:49.311 --> 03:54:49.892]  We all know that.
[03:54:50.312 --> 03:54:52.795]  We see all these headlines that Trump's low energy and all the rest of it.
[03:54:53.776 --> 03:54:57.039]  So, again, everything they say about Trump, it's about them.
[03:54:57.059 --> 03:54:58.741]  Like, Trump wants to put you in camps.
[03:54:59.101 --> 03:55:00.422]  Trump wants to ban your free speech.
[03:55:00.823 --> 03:55:01.884]  Trump wants to ban books.
[03:55:01.944 --> 03:55:02.885]  No, they're the ones banning books.
[03:55:03.145 --> 03:55:06.028]  We're just saying don't give pedophile books to eight-year-olds.
[03:55:08.641 --> 03:55:24.046]  Yeah, and you know, you said it yourself, the only thing that we got left, I've heard it multiple times, is faith in the Lord, and I'm very happy to hear you talking about it on your show normally, and you know, showing people what it looks like to be a man of faith.
[03:55:24.866 --> 03:55:25.906]  And so praise you.
[03:55:25.986 --> 03:55:26.946]  I pray for you all the time.
[03:55:26.966 --> 03:55:28.607]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:55:28.667 --> 03:55:29.827]  We really appreciate you.
[03:55:29.867 --> 03:55:30.447]  God bless you.
[03:55:30.847 --> 03:55:32.908]  All right, this guy's walking off.
[03:55:34.208 --> 03:55:34.688]  What's the next?
[03:55:34.708 --> 03:55:36.128]  It should be Jill next.
[03:55:36.288 --> 03:55:37.168]  Rick to hit me in the face?
[03:55:37.308 --> 03:55:38.569]  It should be Jill hitting you in the face.
[03:55:38.589 --> 03:55:39.849]  All right, let's go to Jill.
[03:55:40.649 --> 03:55:40.989]  Oh, no.
[03:55:41.609 --> 03:55:43.670]  They brought out Rosie O'Donnell's clitoris.
[03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:46.470]  No, I know who this rat is.
[03:55:46.490 --> 03:55:46.830]  Put him on.
[03:55:48.190 --> 03:55:49.031]  Good evening, folks!
[03:55:49.771 --> 03:55:50.591]  Good evening, America!
[03:55:52.116 --> 03:55:53.317]  Good evening, Chicago.
[03:55:53.437 --> 03:55:56.279]  Are there any Democrats in the room tonight?
[03:55:59.801 --> 03:56:03.304]  Folks, we are on the verge of making history.
[03:56:03.924 --> 03:56:06.526]  We are on the verge of an historic election.
[03:56:07.247 --> 03:56:13.771]  And I want to talk with you for just a few minutes about my dear friend, our president, Joe Biden.
[03:56:17.954 --> 03:56:20.116]  Joe Biden's mom had a saying.
[03:56:21.374 --> 03:56:21.914]  Yeah, next is Joe.
[03:56:21.934 --> 03:56:22.835]  I can't do this.
[03:56:22.855 --> 03:56:24.616]  Alex, when we fight, we win.
[03:56:46.997 --> 03:56:50.720]  They fight by cramming ballots with dead people's names on it in the ballot boxes.
[03:56:50.760 --> 03:56:51.420]  That's him.
[03:56:51.440 --> 03:56:52.441]  But folks, Joe Biden's courage
[03:57:15.336 --> 03:57:19.118]  And again, they're the ones that have been trying to take Trump off the ballot and all the lawfare, and they act like he's the bad guy.
[03:57:19.138 --> 03:57:21.219]  He knows the grit and determination of the American people.
[03:57:21.239 --> 03:57:26.642]  He knows the grit and determination of the people that came out to the coup against him.
[03:57:41.758 --> 03:57:43.659]  That's the big thing.
[03:57:43.739 --> 03:57:50.544]  Fading down.
[03:57:50.564 --> 03:57:53.986]  I can't listen anymore.
[03:57:54.006 --> 03:57:56.708]  Totally disgusting.
[03:57:59.090 --> 03:58:01.351]  We joke about this, but they installed Kamala.
[03:58:01.552 --> 03:58:06.275]  Sure, Biden stole it, and then he rigged the primaries, but then they just removed that from him.
[03:58:07.015 --> 03:58:09.777]  They're just making it a giant exercise of rubbing our noses in it.
[03:58:09.817 --> 03:58:10.798]  This is very dangerous.
[03:58:11.215 --> 03:58:15.179]  Yeah, it's malice, disgusting, sigh out.
[03:58:15.199 --> 03:58:18.662]  It's like the Politburo or the Central Committee is appointing someone.
[03:58:19.483 --> 03:58:24.148]  It's like, it reminds me, a lot of this reminds me of the Ottawa Beer trial stuff.
[03:58:24.168 --> 03:58:25.349]  Do you remember that back in North Korea?
[03:58:26.212 --> 03:58:29.793]  Rest of this kid for allegedly stealing some painting off of a wall in a hotel.
[03:58:29.833 --> 03:58:31.234]  He was in North Korea on a school trip.
[03:58:31.634 --> 03:58:36.816]  And he had to do this, like, grotesque confession that was obviously memorized, rehearsed, enforced.
[03:58:38.577 --> 03:58:39.437]  At this mock trial.
[03:58:39.537 --> 03:58:41.097]  And they still beat him into a coma.
[03:58:41.117 --> 03:58:44.979]  Yeah, Trump actually got him back after Obama failed to do so or didn't even try.
[03:58:45.800 --> 03:58:50.486]  And when he came back, they said that he had botulism, which is why he'd lost his mind and he died.
[03:58:50.886 --> 03:58:52.509]  Obviously he'd just been tortured to death.
[03:58:52.569 --> 03:58:55.392]  He was sentenced to years of hard labor in North Korea.
[03:58:55.653 --> 03:59:01.941]  And some of these people that are speaking tonight, you can just tell that they're doing their duty to the party under threat.
[03:59:02.810 --> 03:59:05.911]  They just have that vibe, that energy with these uniforms.
[03:59:05.932 --> 03:59:10.073]  Yeah, guys, show footage of Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong-il with everybody clapping and crying.
[03:59:10.093 --> 03:59:12.395]  Type in people crying in North Korea.
[03:59:12.455 --> 03:59:19.738]  They're like... Chasing him on the boat when he goes away and he waves and they have to act like they're so sad he's leaving and it's like obviously staged.
[03:59:19.798 --> 03:59:22.319]  This is so sterile and just vacant of any soul.
[03:59:26.041 --> 03:59:27.022]  And that's an understatement.
[03:59:28.762 --> 03:59:29.743]  This is anti-soul.
[03:59:32.912 --> 03:59:34.792]  Yeah, this is when Kim Jong-il died.
[03:59:35.873 --> 03:59:37.173]  They're so sad about it.
[03:59:40.074 --> 03:59:40.914]  I mean, look at this.
[03:59:43.734 --> 03:59:44.995]  This is the DNC.
[03:59:45.015 --> 03:59:48.756]  And then show people crying for Kim Jong-un.
[03:59:54.137 --> 03:59:55.457]  I mean, just look at that little rat.
[03:59:56.217 --> 03:59:56.857]  Look at this guy.
[03:59:56.877 --> 03:59:59.478]  I mean, God help us.
[04:00:01.169 --> 04:00:02.370]  It's like every real estate agent.
[04:00:02.730 --> 04:00:04.952]  Notice they've got the guns there and the people don't.
[04:00:06.734 --> 04:00:07.875]  There's some stylish here, though.
[04:00:14.520 --> 04:00:15.381]  And this is the party.
[04:00:15.441 --> 04:00:16.962]  This is the political philosophy.
[04:00:17.002 --> 04:00:18.864]  Oh, hello, Eric Baldwin.
[04:00:18.904 --> 04:00:20.745]  Thank you for your service to me.
[04:00:25.669 --> 04:00:26.649]  Oh, yeah.
[04:00:27.130 --> 04:00:28.311]  Hello, everyone.
[04:00:28.832 --> 04:00:30.453]  You might have not recognized me.
[04:00:30.713 --> 04:00:32.075]  Oh, hi, Klaus Schwab.
[04:00:32.115 --> 04:00:34.297]  Walk over here a little more to the center of the room.
[04:00:34.397 --> 04:00:35.698]  Oh, there you go, Klaus Schwab.
[04:00:36.159 --> 04:00:37.880]  Guys, pull up Team America, Klaus Schwab.
[04:00:37.940 --> 04:00:39.722]  No, it's not Klaus Schwab.
[04:00:39.782 --> 04:00:41.404]  It's Hans Blix.
[04:00:42.024 --> 04:00:43.286]  That was the UN weapons inspector.
[04:00:43.986 --> 04:00:46.228]  Oh, team America, Hans Blix.
[04:00:47.169 --> 04:00:48.491]  In fact, that's the answer until
[04:00:49.625 --> 04:00:51.246]  Jill and all the rest of them come out.
[04:00:52.067 --> 04:00:54.649]  And then his bathing partner, his daughter.
[04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:58.092]  But before we do that, guys, pull up Team America.
[04:00:58.752 --> 04:01:00.133]  Team America, Hans Blix.
[04:01:00.354 --> 04:01:02.415]  Did I ever tell you about my idea to do a Kim Jong Un?
[04:01:02.615 --> 04:01:03.756]  Or, or, I want to hear it.
[04:01:04.197 --> 04:01:06.919]  Or, pull up, or a second one, because I need this for energy.
[04:01:08.160 --> 04:01:08.920]  Team America,
[04:01:10.111 --> 04:01:14.916]  So, I want to do this ad where I wear the poncho, you know, that they have, like the military suit.
[04:01:14.936 --> 04:01:16.698]  Let me see if I can get it done.
[04:01:16.718 --> 04:01:18.941]  Might be able to do it by taking the tie off.
[04:01:18.961 --> 04:01:21.744]  Yeah, keeping the top button button.
[04:01:31.161 --> 04:01:32.301]  Hello, everyone.
[04:01:32.742 --> 04:01:33.922]  I am Kim Jong Un.
[04:01:34.142 --> 04:01:35.843]  You might not recognize me.
[04:01:36.323 --> 04:01:38.203]  Recently, I lost a lot of weight.
[04:01:39.144 --> 04:01:45.486]  I went to Infowarsstore.com and got bodies for inflammation and nitric boost for cardiovascular strength.
[04:01:45.986 --> 04:01:47.627]  And I'm not a communist anymore.
[04:01:47.967 --> 04:01:49.467]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[04:01:50.568 --> 04:01:51.828]  That is very good.
[04:01:51.848 --> 04:01:52.688]  We got to do it, man.
[04:01:54.149 --> 04:01:54.689]  Absolutely.
[04:01:54.729 --> 04:01:55.569]  Let's do it right now.
[04:01:56.370 --> 04:01:57.470]  I want to do the Conan thing.
[04:01:58.092 --> 04:01:58.892]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[04:01:58.932 --> 04:02:00.493]  Tell the audience.
[04:02:00.513 --> 04:02:03.134]  Talk about a boat, man.
[04:02:04.174 --> 04:02:05.134]  Jill's coming out.
[04:02:05.274 --> 04:02:05.914]  Crank it up.
[04:02:06.274 --> 04:02:09.375]  She's so hot.
[04:02:10.976 --> 04:02:11.756]  This is a big one.
[04:02:11.776 --> 04:02:13.257]  Is the crowd leaving yet?
[04:02:13.677 --> 04:02:14.957]  It's 11 o'clock Eastern.
[04:02:15.197 --> 04:02:16.798]  Hi, I'm Vivian Warewell.
[04:02:16.898 --> 04:02:18.318]  Okay, roll the scene.
[04:02:18.418 --> 04:02:19.178]  Oh, children.
[04:02:19.258 --> 04:02:20.219]  Children love him.
[04:02:20.239 --> 04:02:21.639]  Go ahead and roll the Team America clip.
[04:02:28.172 --> 04:02:29.255]  Hans Bricks?
[04:02:29.656 --> 04:02:30.558]  Oh, no!
[04:02:32.783 --> 04:02:33.304]  Oh, hello!
[04:02:33.324 --> 04:02:34.707]  Great to see you again, Hans!
[04:02:35.771 --> 04:02:41.876]  Mr. Eel, I was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today, and your guards won't let me into certain areas.
[04:02:41.916 --> 04:02:42.417]  Let's go home.
[04:02:42.477 --> 04:02:43.437]  Hans, Hans, Hans!
[04:02:43.558 --> 04:02:45.779]  We've been through this a dozen times!
[04:02:46.200 --> 04:02:49.923]  I don't have any weapons of mass destruction, okay, Hans?
[04:02:50.163 --> 04:02:53.225]  Then let me look around so I can ease the UN's collective mind.
[04:02:53.846 --> 04:02:55.868]  Hans, you're breaking my balls here, Hans!
[04:02:55.888 --> 04:02:57.029]  You're breaking my balls!
[04:02:57.529 --> 04:02:59.731]  I'm sorry, but the UN must be firm with you.
[04:03:00.331 --> 04:03:02.313]  Let me see your whole palace, or else.
[04:03:03.834 --> 04:03:04.595]  Or else what?
[04:03:06.101 --> 04:03:09.905]  Or else, we will be very, very angry with you.
[04:03:10.146 --> 04:03:12.949]  And we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.
[04:03:15.231 --> 04:03:15.612]  Okay.
[04:03:15.972 --> 04:03:16.813]  I'll show you, Hans.
[04:03:17.093 --> 04:03:17.554]  You ready?
[04:03:18.195 --> 04:03:19.276]  Stand ready to erect.
[04:03:20.317 --> 04:03:22.539]  Wait a moment.
[04:03:32.142 --> 04:03:40.126]  We now take you live to Chicago where the real bad guys have their puppet-in-chief's wife up there, Jill Biden.
[04:03:59.790 --> 04:04:01.290]  That's his former babysitter.
[04:04:02.291 --> 04:04:04.571]  When he wasn't pilfering his daughter, he was with a babysitter.
[04:04:04.591 --> 04:04:05.531]  When his wife died mysteriously.
[04:04:05.571 --> 04:04:05.832]  Oh yeah.
[04:04:22.410 --> 04:04:29.960]  Like when I handed him our baby Ashley for the first time and saw the smile that lit up his face.
[04:04:31.400 --> 04:04:43.226]  Or on nights after an exhausting day working in the Senate when he would read one more bedtime story just because the kids asked.
[04:04:43.406 --> 04:04:44.606]  And he helped her have a shower.
[04:04:44.907 --> 04:04:53.491]  When he stops on a rope line because he sees someone grieving who needs to know that everything is going to be alright one day.
[04:04:53.511 --> 04:04:54.831]  Or a child to smell or a child to grub.
[04:04:56.880 --> 04:05:04.465]  Or to encourage that child with a stutter to find the confidence she needs.
[04:05:05.906 --> 04:05:13.971]  Those moments when I'm reminded of all he's accomplished in the name of something bigger than himself.
[04:05:15.351 --> 04:05:19.414]  Receiving the Medal of Freedom with humility.
[04:05:19.434 --> 04:05:20.835]  From Lord Obama.
[04:05:28.274 --> 04:05:30.795]  They show those shots when people share their videos.
[04:05:30.815 --> 04:05:31.376]  Oh my god.
[04:05:31.396 --> 04:05:33.757]  Do you have another Team America video?
[04:05:33.797 --> 04:05:37.299]  Team America fag?
[04:05:37.379 --> 04:05:38.460]  Yeah, let's take you live to Team America.
[04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:38.680]  Here we go.
[04:06:01.946 --> 04:06:05.388]  My fellow actors, we live in a dark time.
[04:06:05.888 --> 04:06:10.371]  The world is becoming more and more violent, and the idiots in charge are making it worse.
[04:06:10.751 --> 04:06:17.375]  What the world needs is an international advisory committee who truly understands global politics.
[04:06:17.916 --> 04:06:19.257]  Namely, us.
[04:06:23.119 --> 04:06:27.121]  The time has come for us to start using our acting talents in a different way.
[04:06:27.141 --> 04:06:27.862]  Alan Hutt?
[04:06:28.062 --> 04:06:31.264]  Yes, we can use our powers to change the world.
[04:06:34.318 --> 04:06:37.361]  We will persuade everyone to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking!
[04:06:38.401 --> 04:06:43.766]  If we focus our acting on global politics, we can change everything that's done.
[04:06:47.289 --> 04:06:54.654]  As actors, it is our responsibility to read the newspapers, and then say what we read on television like it's our own opinion.
[04:06:55.976 --> 04:06:56.736]  Matt Damon.
[04:06:57.957 --> 04:06:59.398]  We've all done action films.
[04:06:59.959 --> 04:07:03.722]  If anyone tries to get in our way, we'll show them just how tough us actors really are.
[04:07:09.600 --> 04:07:20.806]  I'm glad you all agree, because I've just been contacted by a very important political leader who is bringing all the world leaders together for a massive international peace conference.
[04:07:21.567 --> 04:07:25.109]  And he wants us to be the keynote speakers.
[04:07:28.250 --> 04:07:28.691]  Hello!
[04:07:29.031 --> 04:07:29.531]  Matt Damon!
[04:07:30.892 --> 04:07:31.852]  Matt Damon!
[04:07:32.413 --> 04:07:34.294]  Say hello to our new partner.
[04:07:43.377 --> 04:07:43.499]  Hmm?
[04:07:51.607 --> 04:07:52.027]  I like it.
[04:07:52.288 --> 04:07:52.688]  I like it.
[04:07:52.708 --> 04:07:53.228]  This is a joke.
[04:07:53.288 --> 04:07:53.909]  I know you hate it.
[04:07:53.929 --> 04:07:55.890]  You told me not to laugh at all when we were in Detroit.
[04:07:56.371 --> 04:07:56.751]  Really?
[04:07:56.791 --> 04:07:57.231]  Embarrassed.
[04:07:58.672 --> 04:07:59.213]  I'm just teasing.
[04:07:59.233 --> 04:07:59.753]  No laughing.
[04:07:59.893 --> 04:08:01.054]  They don't like that shit around here.
[04:08:03.556 --> 04:08:04.177]  I didn't say that.
[04:08:04.237 --> 04:08:05.157]  No, you didn't say that.
[04:08:05.718 --> 04:08:06.819]  There's so many words.
[04:08:06.839 --> 04:08:08.360]  No goofing around.
[04:08:08.380 --> 04:08:09.100]  They're very serious.
[04:08:09.140 --> 04:08:10.301]  DPUSA, very serious.
[04:08:10.521 --> 04:08:11.122]  No goofing around.
[04:08:11.903 --> 04:08:12.143]  Okay.
[04:08:12.163 --> 04:08:12.603]  All right, Jones.
[04:08:12.683 --> 04:08:13.464]  I got it with Vance.
[04:08:13.584 --> 04:08:14.124]  Vance, smell that.
[04:08:14.404 --> 04:08:14.605]  Yeah.
[04:08:14.965 --> 04:08:17.086]  Okay, we have more of Team America for you.
[04:08:17.126 --> 04:08:17.467]  Here it is.
[04:08:19.761 --> 04:08:20.401]  Hang on, team.
[04:08:20.421 --> 04:08:22.322]  Someone has broken into the hangar.
[04:08:22.542 --> 04:08:23.042]  Baxter?
[04:08:23.782 --> 04:08:25.042]  Hey, Team America!
[04:08:25.602 --> 04:08:26.943]  I got something for you!
[04:08:27.783 --> 04:08:28.703]  What the hell?
[04:08:29.043 --> 04:08:30.483]  Prepare to die!
[04:08:30.503 --> 04:08:37.265]  I haven't seen this since I was, like, 12.
[04:08:37.305 --> 04:08:40.665]  Spongebob!
[04:08:41.806 --> 04:08:45.306]  Uh-oh, let's cut to his daughter.
[04:08:45.346 --> 04:08:45.887]  Oh, there she is!
[04:08:46.447 --> 04:08:47.527]  It's shower time.
[04:08:51.325 --> 04:08:51.994]  Good evening.
[04:08:54.454 --> 04:08:55.735]  I have this memory.
[04:08:55.755 --> 04:08:59.197]  It's the year of my eighth birthday.
[04:08:59.517 --> 04:09:01.639]  Dad is still in D.C.
[04:09:01.819 --> 04:09:05.261]  tending to urgent matters in the Senate.
[04:09:05.321 --> 04:09:14.567]  That night, as a surprise, Mom told me, Bo, and Hunter to get in the car.
[04:09:14.587 --> 04:09:21.572]  I remember pulling up to the Wilmington Amtrak station, riding up the escalator to the platform.
[04:09:22.574 --> 04:09:27.816]  The train stops, doors open, and Dad steps out.
[04:09:29.077 --> 04:09:34.519]  As soon as I saw him, I run down that platform and jump into his arms.
[04:09:35.660 --> 04:09:42.523]  Like magic, Mom brought out a cake, they sang happy birthday, and I blew out the candles.
[04:09:43.443 --> 04:09:47.365]  Dad hugged me, and he said that he had to get back to work.
[04:09:48.632 --> 04:09:53.656]  He crossed to the southbound train and off he went to D.C.
[04:09:55.337 --> 04:10:05.325]  That was a snapshot of one moment of one day of this extraordinary journey of being Joe Biden's daughter.
[04:10:08.168 --> 04:10:10.109]  Joe Biden is the OG girl dad.
[04:10:17.742 --> 04:10:18.222]  Yeah, I bet.
[04:10:18.242 --> 04:10:21.165]  Did you see her saying she was turned on by her father in the shower?
[04:10:21.625 --> 04:10:25.728]  He told me I could be anything, and I could do anything.
[04:10:26.608 --> 04:10:38.217]  As a child, I would sit on the leather chair in his office doing my homework, and he would sit next to me doing his work, drafting the Violence Against Women Act.
[04:10:45.327 --> 04:10:47.689]  And he wasn't just a girl dad.
[04:10:49.009 --> 04:10:52.232]  I could see... And he wasn't just a girl dad.
[04:10:52.292 --> 04:10:55.554]  I could see how he valued and trusted women.
[04:10:58.936 --> 04:11:01.118]  How he listened to his mother.
[04:11:01.738 --> 04:11:03.979]  How he believed in his sister.
[04:11:04.700 --> 04:11:08.923]  And most of all, how he respected my mother's career.
[04:11:12.987 --> 04:11:19.351]  Dad was always there doing everything he could to be a true partner to her.
[04:11:19.631 --> 04:11:20.152]  Oh my god.
[04:11:20.712 --> 04:11:31.119]  Dad, you always tell us, but we don't tell you enough, that you are the love of our lives and the life of our love.
[04:11:38.297 --> 04:11:41.500]  I had my wedding reception in my parents' backyard.
[04:11:42.041 --> 04:11:44.203]  At the time, my dad was vice president.
[04:11:45.544 --> 04:11:51.029]  But he was also that dad, who literally set up the entire reception.
[04:11:52.219 --> 04:12:03.532]  He was riding around in his John Deere four-wheeler, fixing the place settings, arranging the plants, and by the way, he was very emotional.
[04:12:04.173 --> 04:12:10.360]  I thought that I would be a mess, but he was the one crying, and I was the one who had to comfort him.
[04:12:12.335 --> 04:12:17.439]  Before he walked me down the aisle... Alright, let's stop right there and gave his daughter away.
[04:12:18.060 --> 04:12:22.463]  Let's play the official DNC Chicago music video.
[04:12:22.483 --> 04:12:22.863]  Here it is.
[04:12:25.466 --> 04:12:26.927]  Everyone has AIDS!
[04:12:28.848 --> 04:12:29.869]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!
[04:12:31.570 --> 04:12:33.092]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!
[04:12:34.433 --> 04:12:35.874]  Everyone has AIDS!
[04:12:38.856 --> 04:12:40.718]  And so this is the end of our story.
[04:12:41.997 --> 04:12:44.237]  And everyone is dead from AIDS.
[04:12:44.478 --> 04:12:46.918]  It took from me my best friend.
[04:12:47.998 --> 04:12:49.119]  My only true pal.
[04:12:50.879 --> 04:12:52.259]  My only bright star.
[04:12:52.539 --> 04:12:54.020]  He died of AIDS!
[04:12:54.060 --> 04:12:55.760]  Well, I'm gonna march on Washington.
[04:12:56.860 --> 04:12:59.181]  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.
[04:12:59.941 --> 04:13:02.301]  There's a hero inside of all of us.
[04:13:02.721 --> 04:13:04.622]  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.
[04:13:05.342 --> 04:13:05.902]  My father?
[04:13:05.922 --> 04:13:06.462]  Apes!
[04:13:06.782 --> 04:13:07.323]  My sister?
[04:13:07.343 --> 04:13:07.943]  Apes!
[04:13:08.303 --> 04:13:10.403]  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend?
[04:13:10.423 --> 04:13:10.603]  Apes!
[04:13:10.623 --> 04:13:10.944]  Apes!
[04:13:10.984 --> 04:13:11.104]  Apes!
[04:13:11.244 --> 04:13:14.625]  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades?
[04:13:14.925 --> 04:13:16.425]  Everyone has Apes!
[04:13:16.545 --> 04:13:18.025]  My grandma and my doggo Blue?
[04:13:18.045 --> 04:13:18.226]  Apes!
[04:13:18.366 --> 04:13:18.546]  Apes!
[04:13:18.566 --> 04:13:18.926]  Apes!
[04:13:18.986 --> 04:13:21.226]  The Pope has got it and so do you!
[04:13:21.306 --> 04:13:21.947]  Everybody's Apes!
[04:13:21.987 --> 04:13:24.227]  Call everybody, we got quilting to do!
[04:13:24.307 --> 04:13:24.587]  Apes!
[04:13:24.707 --> 04:13:24.787]  Apes!
[04:13:24.887 --> 04:13:24.967]  Apes!
[04:13:25.007 --> 04:13:26.808]  We're gonna break down these barricades!
[04:13:26.948 --> 04:13:27.568]  Everyone has Apes!
[04:13:27.688 --> 04:13:27.808]  Apes!
[04:13:28.068 --> 04:13:28.188]  Apes!
[04:13:28.308 --> 04:13:28.468]  Apes!
[04:13:28.668 --> 04:13:28.828]  Apes!
[04:13:29.028 --> 04:13:29.188]  Apes!
[04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.569]  Apes!
[04:13:29.729 --> 04:13:29.829]  Apes!
[04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:30.009]  Apes!
[04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.189]  Apes!
[04:13:30.289 --> 04:13:30.549]  Apes!
[04:13:30.689 --> 04:13:30.849]  Apes!
[04:13:37.995 --> 04:13:38.255]  About you.
[04:13:39.136 --> 04:13:40.457]  About your dreams.
[04:13:41.078 --> 04:13:42.299]  About your dignity.
[04:13:42.840 --> 04:13:44.501]  About your opportunities.
[04:13:44.942 --> 04:13:46.283]  About your family.
[04:13:47.685 --> 04:13:50.828]  Dad knows that family is everything.
[04:13:53.210 --> 04:14:01.939]  When Hunter and I lost our brother Beau to cancer in 2015, the grief and the pain felt like it might never end.
[04:14:03.462 --> 04:14:08.945]  Dad had the capacity to step out of his own pain and absorb ours.
[04:14:10.166 --> 04:14:14.588]  And I know that Beau is here with us tonight, as he is always with us.
[04:14:22.992 --> 04:14:25.414]  And now a word from the CIA that's running this.
[04:14:25.774 --> 04:14:26.434]  Here it is.
[04:14:29.956 --> 04:14:31.637]  Please, Gary, step into my car.
[04:14:33.660 --> 04:14:35.842]  This is Obama stepping into Chicago Park.
[04:14:35.862 --> 04:14:36.522]  Oh, I get it.
[04:14:36.902 --> 04:14:39.564]  I'm supposed to get in your car and let you put your finger inside me.
[04:14:39.885 --> 04:14:41.926]  Then if I go down on you, I get a movie part.
[04:14:43.547 --> 04:14:45.289]  No, I just want to show you something.
[04:14:46.329 --> 04:14:47.270]  Yeah, I'll bet you do.
[04:14:47.851 --> 04:14:49.712]  Please, Gary, I'm not from Hollywood.
[04:15:02.023 --> 04:15:03.164]  This is a nice limo.
[04:15:03.665 --> 04:15:04.625]  Yes, it is.
[04:15:05.967 --> 04:15:06.827]  Just kidding.
[04:15:07.848 --> 04:15:10.130]  Please, how can I make you trust me?
[04:15:13.333 --> 04:15:15.354]  I remember the first time we met.
[04:15:16.395 --> 04:15:21.860]  You were a simple Broadway actor, afraid to get in my limo because you thought I wanted you to perform oral sex on me.
[04:15:22.801 --> 04:15:23.641]  Do you remember that?
[04:15:25.223 --> 04:15:25.423]  Yeah.
[04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:31.631]  And now the tables are turned, and I don't know if I can trust you.
[04:15:34.672 --> 04:15:36.773]  Just give me a chance.
[04:15:41.555 --> 04:15:43.335]  All right, I'll trust you.
[04:15:44.696 --> 04:15:48.437]  But only if you will perform oral sex on me.
[04:15:51.618 --> 04:15:51.858]  What?
[04:15:52.318 --> 04:15:53.319]  Well, it's just late night.
[04:15:53.339 --> 04:15:54.600]  We know we don't have kids watching.
[04:15:55.500 --> 04:15:56.441]  I mean, I'm out of control.
[04:15:56.461 --> 04:15:57.341]  I apologize.
[04:15:57.561 --> 04:15:58.562]  You can't be serious.
[04:15:59.242 --> 04:16:00.223]  Oh, I am serious.
[04:16:00.303 --> 04:16:01.443]  That's fine.
[04:16:02.504 --> 04:16:03.804]  This is my serious face.
[04:16:06.206 --> 04:16:07.006]  What will that prove?
[04:16:07.406 --> 04:16:10.268]  It will prove that you are truly ready to lay everything on the line.
[04:16:10.488 --> 04:16:12.249]  To throw away all your... He's introducing him now.
[04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.549]  Here we go.
[04:16:12.569 --> 04:16:13.009]  Joe Biden!
[04:16:13.029 --> 04:16:13.850]  Here comes the zombie.
[04:16:20.334 --> 04:16:26.740]  Probably got him at 8 o'clock at night.
[04:16:27.240 --> 04:16:29.041]  Oh my god, he can barely walk.
[04:16:29.142 --> 04:16:29.582]  Oh, yeah.
[04:16:31.523 --> 04:16:35.867]  Oh, the big shower head comes down.
[04:16:35.967 --> 04:16:37.729]  It's like Flashdance.
[04:16:39.310 --> 04:16:43.093]  Weston Jones comes up.
[04:16:43.193 --> 04:16:45.955]  Oh, she's got blue nail polish.
[04:16:46.116 --> 04:16:46.296]  Wow.
[04:16:47.574 --> 04:16:52.797]  Look they're all smiling Kamala and Walls like they didn't like do a coup against him.
[04:16:57.340 --> 04:17:04.105]  This is what we went through all the pain to hear.
[04:17:04.125 --> 04:17:06.967]  It's gonna be good Alex.
[04:17:10.064 --> 04:17:15.288]  She's looking at him like he's already dead.
[04:17:15.368 --> 04:17:17.109]  It's the swan song.
[04:17:34.076 --> 04:17:35.777]  Help start World War III, Joe.
[04:17:35.817 --> 04:17:36.317]  Good job.
[04:17:36.517 --> 04:17:37.877]  You blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[04:17:38.418 --> 04:17:39.578]  The border's wide open.
[04:17:39.618 --> 04:17:41.039]  Giant human trafficking of children.
[04:17:41.719 --> 04:17:44.180]  And you raped your daughter.
[04:17:44.200 --> 04:17:45.020]  Mission well done.
[04:17:46.681 --> 04:17:47.821]  Now you can come home to hell.
[04:17:59.286 --> 04:17:59.746]  Where's Hunter?
[04:17:59.766 --> 04:18:02.527]  Not standing next to Natalie, that's for sure.
[04:18:05.862 --> 04:18:07.523]  Well, there's America's enemies right there.
[04:18:08.483 --> 04:18:10.303]  Half of them are on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[04:18:10.804 --> 04:18:13.745]  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
[04:18:13.785 --> 04:18:14.845]  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
[04:18:17.546 --> 04:18:30.050]  Thank you!
[04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:32.231]  I mean, this is even worse than what the Communist Bullet Bill do.
[04:18:35.560 --> 04:18:36.501]  He's like, what's he gonna do?
[04:18:36.521 --> 04:18:43.325]  Watch him fire Kamala and declare himself to Canada.
[04:18:43.365 --> 04:18:44.586]  You did good, Joe.
[04:18:44.986 --> 04:18:46.367]  You answered all the questions.
[04:18:46.467 --> 04:18:49.289]  And at the last minute, they told us he's invincible.
[04:18:49.329 --> 04:18:50.210]  He's sharp as a tack.
[04:18:50.230 --> 04:18:50.810]  He's incredible.
[04:18:51.230 --> 04:18:51.751]  On a dime.
[04:18:51.771 --> 04:18:52.271]  He's horrible.
[04:18:52.291 --> 04:18:52.892]  He's out of his mind.
[04:18:52.912 --> 04:18:53.532]  We gotta remove him.
[04:18:55.213 --> 04:18:56.234]  That's a cult right there.
[04:19:01.257 --> 04:19:01.697]  Look at Walsh.
[04:19:01.737 --> 04:19:03.859]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[04:19:12.640 --> 04:19:13.441]  Alright, I can't handle it.
[04:19:17.444 --> 04:19:17.964]  We gotta watch.
[04:19:17.984 --> 04:19:19.466]  I wanna know what he says.
[04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:24.209]  Well, we gotta save it for the news.
[04:19:24.290 --> 04:19:26.171]  It was a five-minute standing ovation.
[04:19:28.193 --> 04:19:30.855]  I was there when they rained down fire on my goats.
[04:19:36.639 --> 04:19:37.360]  Thank you.
[04:19:37.400 --> 04:19:38.461]  I love you!
[04:19:38.501 --> 04:19:38.921]  I love you!
[04:19:38.941 --> 04:19:39.402]  Thank you.
[04:19:41.784 --> 04:19:42.104]  Thank you.
[04:19:46.294 --> 04:19:47.535]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[04:19:48.175 --> 04:19:53.919]  They're gonna stop for a while.
[04:19:53.999 --> 04:19:55.981]  That was my daughter!
[04:19:56.401 --> 04:19:56.701]  Yeah.
[04:19:56.761 --> 04:19:57.742]  That was my daughter.
[04:19:58.262 --> 04:19:58.783]  He just realized.
[04:19:58.803 --> 04:20:03.606]  Literally the nursing home, like, 98.
[04:20:03.666 --> 04:20:04.046]  Thank you.
[04:20:06.628 --> 04:20:07.669]  Please God, help me.
[04:20:09.951 --> 04:20:10.131]  Alright.
[04:20:11.572 --> 04:20:12.993]  We're on the Michelle O'Donoghue theme song.
[04:20:15.403 --> 04:20:16.063]  He's gonna keep going.
[04:20:17.184 --> 04:20:18.105]  Thank you, Joe.
[04:20:18.465 --> 04:20:18.965]  Thank you.
[04:20:19.045 --> 04:20:19.966]  Look at that, look at that zombie.
[04:20:20.266 --> 04:20:21.207]  Thank you, Joe.
[04:20:21.607 --> 04:20:22.467]  Thank you, Joe.
[04:20:23.468 --> 04:20:24.349]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[04:20:24.849 --> 04:20:25.289]  Thank you.
[04:20:25.549 --> 04:20:25.930]  Thank you.
[04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:27.631]  Thank you, Richard.
[04:20:27.891 --> 04:20:28.231]  Thank you.
[04:20:28.631 --> 04:20:28.972]  Thank you.
[04:20:29.372 --> 04:20:30.252]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[04:20:30.613 --> 04:20:31.273]  I'll tell you what.
[04:20:31.293 --> 04:20:32.294]  I'll tell you what.
[04:20:35.996 --> 04:20:36.816]  I'm still running.
[04:20:38.538 --> 04:20:40.559]  Give me more methamphetamine.
[04:20:43.155 --> 04:20:44.917]  Oh, look at the disingenuousness of this.
[04:20:45.838 --> 04:20:47.039]  Literally a creepy pedophile.
[04:20:47.059 --> 04:20:50.403]  To my dearest daughter Ashley.
[04:20:52.064 --> 04:20:53.546]  God love you, you're incredible.
[04:20:54.186 --> 04:20:55.988]  Thank you for the introduction.
[04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:59.051]  And for being my courageous heart.
[04:20:59.992 --> 04:21:02.395]  Along with Hunter and our entire family.
[04:21:03.936 --> 04:21:06.099]  And especially our rock, Jill.
[04:21:09.813 --> 04:21:10.373]  She's surprised.
[04:21:10.413 --> 04:21:11.434]  She wrote the speech, baby.
[04:21:11.494 --> 04:21:17.036]  Well, as those of you who know us, she still leaves me both breathless and speechless.
[04:21:19.037 --> 04:21:20.017]  Everybody knows her.
[04:21:20.177 --> 04:21:21.838]  I love her more than she loves me.
[04:21:21.858 --> 04:21:24.319]  That's fine.
[04:21:24.339 --> 04:21:27.440]  She walks down the stairs, and I still get that going, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[04:21:28.380 --> 04:21:29.941]  Let me choose a name, sir?
[04:21:29.981 --> 04:21:31.221]  No, no, no, I'm kidding.
[04:21:32.822 --> 04:21:36.023]  Let's give a special round of applause to our First Lady, Jill Biden.
[04:21:37.492 --> 04:21:38.253]  And to Big Mike.
[04:21:38.674 --> 04:21:39.315]  Roll Big Mike.
[04:21:40.035 --> 04:21:41.017]  Roll the Big Mike theme song.
[04:21:41.057 --> 04:21:42.058]  This is only five minutes.
[04:21:42.459 --> 04:21:44.761]  Play it.
[04:21:45.903 --> 04:21:49.107]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[04:21:49.528 --> 04:21:51.891]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS.
[04:21:52.852 --> 04:21:55.115]  An Anaconda, Burrock's favorite pet.
[04:21:55.899 --> 04:21:58.722]  Get him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[04:21:59.363 --> 04:22:02.186]  Joan Rivers said it's true.
[04:22:02.466 --> 04:22:04.708]  Under the dress, it's become unglued.
[04:22:04.809 --> 04:22:08.813]  Put it back on now, Big Mike's gonna let it show!
[04:22:11.496 --> 04:22:17.482]  Alright, let's go back to Jeb, I think he's not talking.
[04:22:27.090 --> 04:22:29.592]  Folks, let me ask you... We love him!
[04:22:29.612 --> 04:22:29.952]  We love him!
[04:22:29.972 --> 04:22:30.232]  We love him!
[04:22:31.573 --> 04:22:31.813]  We love him!
[04:22:31.933 --> 04:22:32.154]  We love him!
[04:22:32.174 --> 04:22:32.414]  We love him!
[04:22:32.434 --> 04:22:33.194]  We love him!
[04:22:33.214 --> 04:22:33.454]  We love him!
[04:22:33.474 --> 04:22:33.715]  We love him!
[04:22:33.735 --> 04:22:33.955]  We love him!
[04:22:33.975 --> 04:22:34.195]  We love him!
[04:22:34.215 --> 04:22:34.435]  We love him!
[04:22:34.715 --> 04:22:34.976]  We love him!
[04:22:34.996 --> 04:22:35.276]  We love him!
[04:22:35.296 --> 04:22:35.576]  We love him!
[04:22:35.596 --> 04:22:35.816]  We love him!
[04:22:35.836 --> 04:22:36.116]  We love him!
[04:22:36.136 --> 04:22:36.356]  We love him!
[04:22:36.376 --> 04:22:36.617]  We love him!
[04:22:38.118 --> 04:22:39.038]  We love him!
[04:22:39.058 --> 04:22:39.279]  We love him!
[04:22:39.299 --> 04:22:39.539]  We love him!
[04:22:39.559 --> 04:22:39.799]  We love him!
[04:22:39.819 --> 04:22:40.279]  We love him!
[04:22:40.299 --> 04:22:40.579]  We love him!
[04:22:40.599 --> 04:22:40.920]  We love him!
[04:22:40.940 --> 04:22:41.180]  We love him!
[04:22:41.200 --> 04:22:41.480]  We love him!
[04:22:41.500 --> 04:22:41.720]  We love him!
[04:22:41.740 --> 04:22:41.960]  We love him!
[04:22:41.980 --> 04:22:42.241]  We love him!
[04:22:42.261 --> 04:22:42.561]  We love him!
[04:22:42.581 --> 04:22:42.801]  We love him!
[04:22:42.821 --> 04:22:43.061]  We love him!
[04:22:43.421 --> 04:22:43.662]  We love him!
[04:22:43.682 --> 04:22:43.922]  We love him!
[04:22:43.962 --> 04:22:44.222]  We love him!
[04:22:44.242 --> 04:22:44.482]  We love him!
[04:22:44.522 --> 04:22:45.663]  We love him!
[04:22:45.683 --> 04:22:45.943]  We love him!
[04:22:45.963 --> 04:22:46.283]  We love him!
[04:22:46.323 --> 04:22:46.584]  We love him!
[04:22:48.625 --> 04:22:48.865]  We love him!
[04:22:48.925 --> 04:22:49.285]  We love him!
[04:22:49.306 --> 04:22:49.546]  We love him!
[04:22:49.566 --> 04:22:49.826]  We love him!
[04:22:49.846 --> 04:22:50.066]  We love him!
[04:22:50.086 --> 04:22:50.306]  We love him!
[04:22:50.807 --> 04:22:51.107]  We love him!
[04:22:51.147 --> 04:22:51.387]  We love him!
[04:22:51.407 --> 04:22:53.348]  We love him!
[04:22:53.368 --> 04:22:53.609]  We love him!
[04:22:53.629 --> 04:22:53.909]  We love him!
[04:22:53.929 --> 04:22:54.169]  We love him!
[04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.229]  We
[04:22:56.016 --> 04:23:03.261]  My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly four years ago, in winter, on the steps of the Capitol, on a cold January day,
[04:23:26.687 --> 04:23:45.771]  I raised my right hand and I swore an oath to you and to God to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States.
[04:23:45.871 --> 04:23:50.492]  In front of me, in front of me was the city surrounded by the National Guard.
[04:23:51.753 --> 04:23:52.393]  Behind me,
[04:23:54.406 --> 04:23:59.830]  A capital, just two weeks before, had been overrun by a violent mob.
[04:24:01.652 --> 04:24:10.859]  But I knew then, from the bottom of my heart, that I knew now, there is no place in America for political violence.
[04:24:11.780 --> 04:24:12.100]  None!
[04:24:12.120 --> 04:24:16.483]  Unless you're burning the city down, all the most peaceful, and your VP was bailing people out.
[04:24:16.503 --> 04:24:19.966]  You cannot say you love your country only when you win!
[04:24:19.986 --> 04:24:22.928]  You stole it, you lion sack of garbage.
[04:24:24.119 --> 04:24:28.803]  Show the famous Biden graph where Trump's winning and then the poll, the voting closes and it goes straight up.
[04:24:28.823 --> 04:24:30.104]  I was looking to the past.
[04:24:31.225 --> 04:24:32.406]  I was looking to the future.
[04:24:33.947 --> 04:24:35.408]  I spoke with the work at hand.
[04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:45.176]  The moment we had to meet, it was as I told you then, a winter of peril and possibility.
[04:24:46.437 --> 04:24:48.639]  A peril and possibility.
[04:24:50.060 --> 04:24:53.483]  We're in the grip of a once in a century pandemic.
[04:24:55.205 --> 04:24:56.406]  Historic joblessness.
[04:24:56.426 --> 04:24:57.567]  They're trying to bring back now.
[04:24:57.587 --> 04:24:59.970]  A call for racial justice long overdue.
[04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.831]  Historic joblessness.
[04:25:02.833 --> 04:25:06.917]  Clear and present threats to our very democracy.
[04:25:09.860 --> 04:25:10.340]  Thank you.
[04:25:11.661 --> 04:25:12.522]  The train seals.
[04:25:12.662 --> 04:25:15.906]  When he screws up and starts to fumble, they had to just change it.
[04:25:15.926 --> 04:25:17.087]  They had to pause the teleprompter.
[04:25:24.880 --> 04:25:27.421]  I love these people.
[04:25:28.922 --> 04:25:33.063]  And I believe now that progress was and is possible.
[04:25:34.244 --> 04:25:35.464]  Justice is achievable.
[04:25:36.605 --> 04:25:40.006]  And our best days are not behind us, they're before us.
[04:25:45.809 --> 04:25:47.129]  Now, it's summer.
[04:25:48.090 --> 04:25:49.190]  The winter has passed.
[04:25:50.310 --> 04:25:53.832]  And with a grateful heart, I stand before you now
[04:25:54.699 --> 04:25:58.862]  On this August night to report that democracy has prevailed.
[04:25:58.882 --> 04:26:01.143]  Yeah, right.
[04:26:01.283 --> 04:26:02.924]  It's like on that Civil War, we lose.
[04:26:03.565 --> 04:26:04.325]  Democracy.
[04:26:05.326 --> 04:26:06.707]  Democracy has delivered.
[04:26:07.467 --> 04:26:08.688]  Yeah, appointed people.
[04:26:08.948 --> 04:26:11.750]  And now democracy must be preserved.
[04:26:12.530 --> 04:26:20.315]  Which means appointed, coronated, selected, installed, artificially forced.
[04:26:21.376 --> 04:26:22.837]  You've heard me say it before.
[04:26:26.044 --> 04:26:39.672]  We're facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history, when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.
[04:26:39.772 --> 04:26:40.653]  That's not hyperbole.
[04:26:40.713 --> 04:26:41.574]  I mean it literally.
[04:26:43.115 --> 04:26:45.436]  We're in a battle for the very soul of America.
[04:26:47.037 --> 04:26:53.861]  I ran for president in 2020 because of what I saw in Charlottesville in August of 2017.
[04:26:56.340 --> 04:26:56.980]  Extremist.
[04:26:58.201 --> 04:26:59.202]  Coming out of the woods.
[04:27:00.162 --> 04:27:01.103]  Carrying torches.
[04:27:02.324 --> 04:27:03.804]  Their veins bulging.
[04:27:04.265 --> 04:27:05.546]  Hired Democrats.
[04:27:06.506 --> 04:27:08.107]  Carrying Nazi swastikas.
[04:27:08.887 --> 04:27:14.851]  And chanting the same exact anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early 30s.
[04:27:14.871 --> 04:27:17.392]  150,000 protesters are standing outside the gates.
[04:27:18.513 --> 04:27:19.414]  White supremacists.
[04:27:20.434 --> 04:27:21.515]  The Ku Klux Klan.
[04:27:22.015 --> 04:27:22.996]  Is he seriously going to claim?
[04:27:24.301 --> 04:27:27.042]  That Trump said they were fine people.
[04:27:27.142 --> 04:27:28.663]  Of course he is.
[04:27:29.983 --> 04:27:30.323]  They're hoods.
[04:27:30.344 --> 04:27:31.584]  They're not Democrats.
[04:27:31.624 --> 04:27:34.305]  They're not wearing hoods.
[04:27:34.665 --> 04:27:36.166]  Yeah, there he is with the Grand Dragon.
[04:27:54.076 --> 04:27:56.857]  That they long sought to tear apart America.
[04:27:58.517 --> 04:28:00.238]  In the process, a young woman was killed.
[04:28:01.998 --> 04:28:05.179]  When I contacted her mother, I asked about what happened.
[04:28:05.319 --> 04:28:15.883]  She told me, when the president was asked what he thought had happened, Donald Trump said, and I quote, there are very fine people on both sides.
[04:28:15.903 --> 04:28:16.323]  Knew it.
[04:28:16.503 --> 04:28:16.843]  I knew it.
[04:28:16.883 --> 04:28:17.763]  My God.
[04:28:18.624 --> 04:28:19.544]  That's what he said.
[04:28:19.684 --> 04:28:21.004]  Even Snopes says that's not true.
[04:28:21.024 --> 04:28:22.845]  That is what he said and what he meant.
[04:28:23.908 --> 04:28:28.432]  That's when I realized I had to listen to the admonition of my dead son.
[04:28:29.132 --> 04:28:31.194]  I could not stay in the sidelines.
[04:28:32.455 --> 04:28:38.861]  So I ran.
[04:28:38.921 --> 04:28:39.621]  Thank you, Joe.
[04:28:39.721 --> 04:28:41.523]  I had no intention of running again.
[04:28:41.543 --> 04:28:44.445]  I just lost part of my soul.
[04:28:44.465 --> 04:28:44.505]  Oh.
[04:28:46.187 --> 04:28:47.748]  But I ran with a deep conviction.
[04:28:49.029 --> 04:28:51.912]  In America, I know and believe
[04:28:52.961 --> 04:28:59.785]  Folks, we've got to fight these people.
[04:28:59.825 --> 04:29:02.627]  Please financially support us at infowarshore.com.
[04:29:02.647 --> 04:29:08.691]  It takes money to take these monsters on, and we're going to beat them together, but we need you to spread the word, support the broadcast.
[04:29:08.711 --> 04:29:10.932]  Folks, we have great products, infowarshore.com.
[04:29:10.952 --> 04:29:11.552]  They're amazing.
[04:29:12.133 --> 04:29:13.834]  T-shirts, books, films, water filtration.
[04:29:14.834 --> 04:29:16.355]  It takes money to fight the machine.
[04:29:16.715 --> 04:29:17.656]  Support President Trump.
[04:29:17.676 --> 04:29:22.339]  95% of corporate money is going to Biden's controllers, to Kamala.
[04:29:24.164 --> 04:29:26.946]  And a broad coalition of Americans joined with me.
[04:29:28.247 --> 04:29:30.909]  Eighty-one million voters voted for us.
[04:29:31.249 --> 04:29:31.569]  All right.
[04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:34.952]  At any time in all of history.
[04:29:36.133 --> 04:29:37.354]  Gotta keep reporting that live.
[04:29:37.614 --> 04:29:43.718]  Because of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy.
[04:29:44.239 --> 04:29:44.719]  Oh, yeah.
[04:29:45.960 --> 04:29:47.041]  We're a republic, Dumbo.
[04:29:49.563 --> 04:29:52.525]  As your president, I've been determined
[04:29:53.530 --> 04:29:56.952]  To keep America moving forward, not going back.
[04:29:58.352 --> 04:30:01.154]  To stand against hate and violence in all its forms.
[04:30:02.234 --> 04:30:07.917]  To be a nation where we not only live with, but thrive on diversity.
[04:30:09.078 --> 04:30:10.378]  Demonizing no one.
[04:30:11.459 --> 04:30:12.620]  Leaving no one behind.
[04:30:12.640 --> 04:30:13.680]  Except white people.
[04:30:13.860 --> 04:30:16.461]  And becoming the nation that we profess to be.
[04:30:16.481 --> 04:30:19.203]  Please let it end.
[04:30:19.223 --> 04:30:19.863]  I also ran.
[04:30:19.883 --> 04:30:21.244]  Please let it end.
[04:30:23.001 --> 04:30:24.983]  To rebuild the backbone of America.
[04:30:26.084 --> 04:30:27.345]  The middle class.
[04:30:32.009 --> 04:30:36.433]  I made a commitment to you.
[04:30:36.453 --> 04:30:39.576]  That I'd be a president for all Americans.
[04:30:40.677 --> 04:30:42.198]  Whether you voted for me or not.
[04:30:44.340 --> 04:30:45.221]  We have done that.
[04:30:46.882 --> 04:30:47.663]  Studies show.
[04:30:49.133 --> 04:30:53.174]  The major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red states than blue.
[04:30:54.875 --> 04:30:56.835]  Because the job of the president... I think it's time.
[04:30:56.855 --> 04:30:57.576]  We've heard all this before.
[04:30:57.596 --> 04:30:59.036]  I think it's time to see a Team America clip.
[04:30:59.136 --> 04:31:00.496]  I don't know why.
[04:31:00.556 --> 04:31:01.077]  It'll make sense.
[04:31:01.097 --> 04:31:03.637]  Here it is.
[04:31:15.704 --> 04:31:17.625]  Remember he handed Afghanistan over to him?
[04:31:17.645 --> 04:31:17.725]  Shit.
[04:31:17.865 --> 04:31:18.586]  Come on, Gary.
[04:31:19.006 --> 04:31:19.566]  That's it.
[04:31:19.746 --> 04:31:20.547]  You have the power.
[04:31:20.567 --> 04:31:21.847]  And gave them $80,000,000 in weapons?
[04:31:23.108 --> 04:31:23.428]  Buck.
[04:31:23.708 --> 04:31:23.968]  Dirk.
[04:31:24.008 --> 04:31:24.248]  Dirk.
[04:31:24.308 --> 04:31:24.789]  Allah.
[04:31:27.230 --> 04:31:27.570]  Dirka.
[04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.950]  Dirka.
[04:31:28.230 --> 04:31:29.131]  Muhammad Jihad.
[04:31:30.091 --> 04:31:30.411]  Haka.
[04:31:30.431 --> 04:31:30.751]  Sherpa.
[04:31:30.771 --> 04:31:31.132]  Sherpa.
[04:31:31.652 --> 04:31:31.832]  Buck.
[04:31:31.872 --> 04:31:32.152]  Allah.
[04:31:34.533 --> 04:31:34.653]  Oh!
[04:31:34.713 --> 04:31:34.933]  Dirka.
[04:31:34.953 --> 04:31:35.174]  Dirka.
[04:31:35.194 --> 04:31:35.514]  Dirka.
[04:31:38.555 --> 04:31:39.336]  All right, Gary!
[04:31:39.616 --> 04:31:40.796]  Told you he was a tough gun.
[04:31:41.277 --> 04:31:42.677]  I've never seen acting that good.
[04:31:43.197 --> 04:31:43.998]  He's amazing.
[04:31:51.822 --> 04:32:08.510]  We are Bashir rebels from the country of Somalia.
[04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:09.271]  Who are you?
[04:32:11.652 --> 04:32:13.293]  My name is Hakme.
[04:32:13.613 --> 04:32:14.793]  I'm a terrorist.
[04:32:17.919 --> 04:32:20.901]  Anybody know of any terrorist attacks coming up soon?
[04:32:34.227 --> 04:32:36.428]  I sense that I'm becoming attracted to Gary.
[04:32:38.749 --> 04:32:40.930]  My advice is not to get involved with the team members, Sarah.
[04:32:41.591 --> 04:32:43.232]  It's too painful to see them die.
[04:32:44.890 --> 04:32:45.811]  I'm sorry, Lisa.
[04:32:46.311 --> 04:32:47.872]  I didn't mean to bring up... It's okay, Sarah.
[04:32:48.833 --> 04:32:49.853]  I treasure your friendship.
[04:32:50.954 --> 04:32:52.375]  I treasure yours, Lisa.
[04:32:52.395 --> 04:33:01.601]  Hey, have you ever thought of telling Sarah how you feel?
[04:33:01.621 --> 04:33:03.363]  Huh.
[04:33:03.963 --> 04:33:07.225]  What would a girl like Sarah want with a simple Nebraska boy like me?
[04:33:08.106 --> 04:33:10.908]  I don't know nothing about fancy cars and fancy restaurants.
[04:33:12.270 --> 04:33:25.857]  Still, I'd love to show her full moon night on the cornfields.
[04:33:29.760 --> 04:33:30.620]  What do you know?
[04:33:32.181 --> 04:33:34.302]  I heard there might be a large terrorist attack.
[04:33:35.303 --> 04:33:37.544]  If you tell me what it is, maybe I could help out.
[04:33:38.900 --> 04:33:39.700]  Get out of here!
[04:33:40.301 --> 04:33:44.323]  We have put out a jihad on the infidels because they destroyed our lives.
[04:33:45.504 --> 04:33:47.705]  What do you know about pain and sadness?
[04:33:59.191 --> 04:34:03.193]  I was just a boy when the infidels came to my village in their Blackhawk helicopters.
[04:34:05.302 --> 04:34:08.923]  The infidels fired at the oil fields and they lit up like the eyes of Allah.
[04:34:09.683 --> 04:34:12.844]  Burning oil rained down from the sky and cooked everything it touched.
[04:34:13.545 --> 04:34:20.987]  I could only hide myself and cry as my goats were consumed by the fiery black liquid death.
[04:34:21.267 --> 04:34:26.609]  In the midst of the chaos, I could swear that I heard my goats screaming for help.
[04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:31.550]  As quickly as they'd come, the infidels were gone.
[04:34:32.791 --> 04:34:33.731]  It was on that day,
[04:34:34.855 --> 04:34:36.076]  I put a jihad on them.
[04:34:39.598 --> 04:34:42.700]  And if you don't believe it, then you better kill me now.
[04:34:43.861 --> 04:34:45.642]  Because I'll put a jihad on you too.
[04:34:52.487 --> 04:34:53.027]  I like you.
[04:34:53.748 --> 04:34:54.768]  You have balls.
[04:34:55.769 --> 04:34:56.890]  I like balls.
[04:34:59.907 --> 04:35:00.928]  All right, listen carefully.
[04:35:01.068 --> 04:35:05.151]  The WMDs are located in a secret bunker 20 yards east of this building.
[04:35:05.591 --> 04:35:06.872]  You can help us by... Shit!
[04:35:06.932 --> 04:35:09.474]  I've got five terrorists going southeast on Bakalakadaka Street!
[04:35:10.935 --> 04:35:13.096]  Don't let them get away!
[04:35:30.607 --> 04:35:30.967]  All right.
[04:35:31.027 --> 04:35:32.528]  This is critical information.
[04:35:34.129 --> 04:35:35.430]  But it's more serious than anything they're saying.
[04:35:35.450 --> 04:35:37.711]  They just lie to everybody.
[04:35:37.891 --> 04:35:41.773]  86,000 RSAs to target working class people, particularly people getting tips.
[04:35:42.193 --> 04:35:44.254]  Now they claim they want to, you know, give you all this free stuff.
[04:35:44.294 --> 04:35:45.055]  They're liars.
[04:35:47.336 --> 04:35:49.897]  And the reason I played over Biden, anybody who wants to actually go hear him can do it.
[04:35:49.937 --> 04:35:51.558]  Actually, nobody really actually wants to watch him here.
[04:35:51.578 --> 04:35:54.260]  We're just here to, like, get in their face, let them know that they'll burn in hell.
[04:35:54.480 --> 04:35:56.521]  I'll burn in hell before I ever roll over their scum.
[04:35:57.081 --> 04:35:58.202]  Let's hear the rest of the Crib Keeper.
[04:35:59.970 --> 04:36:01.251]  That's something Trump did.
[04:36:01.271 --> 04:36:03.452]  He lost his degree though?
[04:36:03.472 --> 04:36:03.772]  Chips?
[04:36:03.812 --> 04:36:03.872]  Oh.
[04:36:30.350 --> 04:36:31.732]  Size and football field.
[04:36:32.893 --> 04:36:34.715]  We'll be over $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree!
[04:36:43.238 --> 04:36:46.740]  All right, guys.
[04:36:46.760 --> 04:36:47.761]  Harris is on at 8 a.m.
[04:36:47.841 --> 04:36:48.701]  I'm on at 11 a.m.
[04:36:48.901 --> 04:36:52.023]  You're filling in for Owen while he takes care of his turtle.
[04:36:52.103 --> 04:36:52.383]  Okay.
[04:36:52.483 --> 04:36:53.744]  What's Harris doing?
[04:36:54.044 --> 04:36:55.265]  He's doing a war room.
[04:36:55.285 --> 04:36:58.046]  He's going to stay and cover this shit afterward.
[04:36:58.106 --> 04:36:59.947]  All right, well, thanks for working so hard.
[04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:03.469]  I think we've all heard of this before.
[04:37:06.823 --> 04:37:07.183]  I don't know.
[04:37:07.224 --> 04:37:09.646]  I mean, before I saw him speak, I wasn't going to vote for him.
[04:37:09.667 --> 04:37:09.747]  Yeah.
[04:37:09.767 --> 04:37:10.848]  He convinced me to.
[04:37:24.670 --> 04:37:31.334]  You know, the correct thing for him to do here was just to come out and say a few nice things about Kamala and graciously endorse her again, and then leave.
[04:37:31.374 --> 04:37:33.676]  But he's doing a campaign speech for himself.
[04:37:33.716 --> 04:37:36.757]  What I really want to be here for is Kamala.
[04:37:36.777 --> 04:37:39.619]  She won't do too well in the floor prompter.
[04:37:39.759 --> 04:37:42.041]  That's when they shut things down to blame Trump, and then now you're back?
[04:37:42.061 --> 04:37:42.581]  Now you're back.
[04:37:42.601 --> 04:37:42.801]  Right.
[04:37:52.932 --> 04:37:56.494]  That's why I'm proud to have been the first president to walk a picket line
[04:38:19.665 --> 04:38:21.065]  Look at those eyes.
[04:38:21.085 --> 04:38:22.386]  He died a long time ago.
[04:38:22.426 --> 04:38:26.327]  He's more of a machined man now.
[04:38:29.268 --> 04:38:32.549]  I've been waiting for you.
[04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:34.790]  The circle is now complete.
[04:38:34.890 --> 04:38:37.531]  When I met you, I was but a runaway.
[04:38:38.251 --> 04:38:41.652]  Now I am a master.
[04:38:41.692 --> 04:38:44.713]  It pleases me to be the first to do the voice.
[04:38:45.213 --> 04:38:46.013]  Which one movie is that?
[04:38:46.233 --> 04:38:47.394]  Welcome, Megatron.
[04:38:49.569 --> 04:38:51.130]  I am Unicron.
[04:38:52.870 --> 04:38:54.610]  I have summoned you here for a purpose.
[04:38:55.571 --> 04:38:58.391]  Nobody summons Megatron!
[04:38:58.411 --> 04:39:02.192]  Then it pleases me to be the first.
[04:39:02.673 --> 04:39:04.173]  State your business.
[04:39:05.473 --> 04:39:06.974]  These are my commands.
[04:39:08.594 --> 04:39:12.035]  We pass the most significant climate law in the history of mankind.
[04:39:17.220 --> 04:39:21.063]  He literally had to do a montage of Team America in order to make this tolerable.
[04:39:21.503 --> 04:39:23.345]  I have nothing to fear.
[04:39:23.645 --> 04:39:27.387]  I crushed Optimus Prime in my bare hands.
[04:39:27.428 --> 04:39:28.628]  You exaggerate.
[04:39:28.668 --> 04:39:30.710]  The point is he's dead.
[04:39:31.190 --> 04:39:33.012]  And the Matrix died with him.
[04:39:33.232 --> 04:39:35.774]  The point is you're a fool.
[04:39:37.275 --> 04:39:40.957]  The Matrix was transferred to their new leader, Ultra Magnus.
[04:39:41.237 --> 04:39:42.578]  Destroy it for me.
[04:39:43.799 --> 04:39:50.524]  500,000.
[04:39:43.819 --> 04:39:50.524]  500,000 charging stations all across America.
[04:39:51.044 --> 04:39:54.847]  This is actually, they found this from the Transformers movie that I've never seen.
[04:39:55.868 --> 04:40:00.271]  But, but I was kind of cyber stalking Orson Welles.
[04:40:00.371 --> 04:40:08.237]  I was just typing Orson Welles' last work and he like cut the audio for this movie as a Galvatron.
[04:40:09.435 --> 04:40:12.337]  And then he died of a heart attack, like, two days later.
[04:40:13.618 --> 04:40:14.538]  So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:40:15.119 --> 04:40:19.101]  Go ahead and fast-forward this a little bit to when they throw him out of the spaceship here in about a minute.
[04:40:20.082 --> 04:40:20.823]  And then we'll play this.
[04:40:20.843 --> 04:40:21.543]  This is more important.
[04:40:22.404 --> 04:40:22.824]  I'm serious.
[04:40:22.844 --> 04:40:24.385]  People tune in here for a little bit of enjoyment.
[04:40:27.707 --> 04:40:31.650]  They had that big, ASTRO TRAIN, GET US OUT OF HERE!
[04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:33.711]  I can do all their voices.
[04:40:33.731 --> 04:40:34.151]  Pretty impressive.
[04:40:34.191 --> 04:40:34.872]  Starscream, yeah.
[04:40:35.392 --> 04:40:37.854]  And then, well, that's the same voice as Cobra Commander.
[04:40:39.512 --> 04:40:40.232]  I'm the leader.
[04:40:40.252 --> 04:40:40.873]  Yeah, crank it up.
[04:40:40.893 --> 04:40:41.513]  Here's the audio.
[04:40:41.873 --> 04:40:43.754]  Do I hear a second on that?
[04:40:44.714 --> 04:40:44.894]  Aye!
[04:40:46.174 --> 04:40:47.115]  And against?
[04:40:47.615 --> 04:40:48.275]  Nay!
[04:40:48.515 --> 04:40:51.016]  Oh, how it pains me to do this!
[04:40:51.856 --> 04:40:52.797]  We're gonna do a piece on this.
[04:40:53.077 --> 04:40:53.577]  Get!
[04:40:53.997 --> 04:40:55.278]  Make room for others!
[04:40:55.438 --> 04:40:55.938]  Don't!
[04:40:56.578 --> 04:40:58.018]  This is what they did to Joe Biden.
[04:40:58.058 --> 04:41:00.699]  They threw him out of the ship.
[04:41:00.739 --> 04:41:01.600]  Cut back to Biden real quick.
[04:41:01.900 --> 04:41:04.981]  Oh, how it pains me to do this!
[04:41:05.885 --> 04:41:06.405]  Wait!
[04:41:07.026 --> 04:41:08.787]  I still function!
[04:41:08.988 --> 04:41:18.496]  I still function!
[04:41:19.817 --> 04:41:21.818]  Welcome, Megatron.
[04:41:22.339 --> 04:41:22.699]  Turn it up.
[04:41:23.660 --> 04:41:24.060]  Keep going.
[04:41:25.882 --> 04:41:26.643]  Good job.
[04:41:27.403 --> 04:41:28.304]  Welcome.
[04:41:28.504 --> 04:41:30.466]  Welcome, Megatron.
[04:41:31.767 --> 04:41:31.787]  I...
[04:41:39.688 --> 04:41:40.910]  Who said that?
[04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:42.192]  I am Unicron.
[04:41:56.433 --> 04:41:58.755]  I have summoned you here for a purpose.
[04:41:58.975 --> 04:41:59.496]  Nobody!
[04:41:59.676 --> 04:42:03.459]  Nobody summons Megatron!
[04:42:03.999 --> 04:42:06.601]  Then it pleases me to be the first.
[04:42:07.762 --> 04:42:09.603]  State your business!
[04:42:10.964 --> 04:42:12.385]  This is my command.
[04:42:12.946 --> 04:42:17.049]  You are to destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.
[04:42:18.290 --> 04:42:23.794]  It is the one thing, the only thing, that can stand in
[04:42:25.592 --> 04:42:27.432]  You have nothing to fear.
[04:42:27.992 --> 04:42:32.193]  I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.
[04:42:32.733 --> 04:42:33.973]  You exaggerate.
[04:42:34.534 --> 04:42:38.454]  The point is he's dead, and the Matrix died with him.
[04:42:39.114 --> 04:42:42.635]  No, the point is you're a fool.
[04:42:43.595 --> 04:42:48.636]  The Matrix has been passed to their new leader, Ultra Magnus.
[04:42:49.896 --> 04:42:51.036]  Destroy it for me.
[04:42:51.396 --> 04:42:52.337]  Why should I?
[04:42:52.897 --> 04:42:53.877]  What's in it for me?
[04:42:55.475 --> 04:42:59.377]  Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well.
[04:43:00.438 --> 04:43:04.680]  I will provide you with a new body and new troops to command.
[04:43:04.700 --> 04:43:04.760]  And?
[04:43:06.021 --> 04:43:06.681]  And nothing.
[04:43:08.782 --> 04:43:10.643]  You belong to me now.
[04:43:11.244 --> 04:43:13.605]  I belong to nobody!
[04:43:14.165 --> 04:43:16.367]  Perhaps I misjudged you.
[04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:18.528]  Proceed.
[04:43:21.155 --> 04:43:33.242]  If I were Trump, and I had almost been killed by a centimere, by a bullet's width... Excellent.
[04:43:34.043 --> 04:43:37.284]  Excellent.
[04:43:37.344 --> 04:43:39.566]  Behold, Galvatron.
[04:43:42.259 --> 04:43:43.840]  I got this memorized, we're gonna cut a piece on this.
[04:43:45.380 --> 04:43:49.981]  We're, uh... Elon Musk is Unicron, and I'm Megatron.
[04:43:50.001 --> 04:43:54.683]  I can do all this so they all actually look like the people, but they're still Transformers, so yeah, we'll be there.
[04:43:54.783 --> 04:43:55.143]  Great.
[04:43:56.343 --> 04:43:57.243]  Galvatron.
[04:43:58.424 --> 04:44:01.184]  And these shall be your minions.
[04:44:04.865 --> 04:44:05.446]  Scourge.
[04:44:06.146 --> 04:44:06.666]  The Trekker.
[04:44:08.992 --> 04:44:11.815]  And his huntsman, the sweeps.
[04:44:15.318 --> 04:44:22.045]  Cyclonus, the warrior, and his armada.
[04:44:22.085 --> 04:44:24.788]  Now go, shall be your ship.
[04:44:26.309 --> 04:44:29.312]  Now go.
[04:44:29.812 --> 04:44:32.795]  Destroy the Autobot Matrix.
[04:44:34.316 --> 04:44:40.960]  I will rip open Ultra Magnus and every other Autobot until the Matrix has been destroyed!
[04:44:43.041 --> 04:44:45.022]  To Cybertron!
[04:44:45.342 --> 04:44:46.743]  To Cybertron!
[04:45:04.423 --> 04:45:05.023]  Oh, this isn't real?
[04:45:08.704 --> 04:45:10.205]  As your new leader!
[04:45:10.645 --> 04:45:14.146]  Oh, this isn't real?
[04:45:15.626 --> 04:45:17.607]  And then Leonard Nimoy does Galvatron's voice.
[04:45:18.847 --> 04:45:20.527]  Who disrupts my coronation?
[04:45:23.416 --> 04:45:25.577]  Coronation Starscream?
[04:45:25.637 --> 04:45:26.638]  That's bad comedy.
[04:45:26.658 --> 04:45:27.879]  This is bad comedy.
[04:45:28.139 --> 04:45:28.999]  Megatron?
[04:45:29.359 --> 04:45:30.040]  Is that you?
[04:45:30.060 --> 04:45:31.140]  There's a hint.
[04:45:31.300 --> 04:45:33.021]  It's literally what happened.
[04:45:33.201 --> 04:45:44.228]  That's why it's so ridiculous.
[04:45:44.268 --> 04:45:46.469]  Would anyone else like to fill his shoes?
[04:45:58.089 --> 04:46:01.032]  Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?
[04:46:02.273 --> 04:46:03.854]  What did he say his name was?
[04:46:05.115 --> 04:46:06.336]  Galvatron!
[04:46:07.017 --> 04:46:12.081]  I'm Galvatron!
[04:46:13.642 --> 04:46:15.884]  Galvatron!
[04:46:15.944 --> 04:46:16.064]  Hi!
[04:46:16.264 --> 04:46:17.626]  That's for trying to kill Trump.
[04:46:21.209 --> 04:46:23.531]  I've waited a lifetime for this, Prime.
[04:46:24.991 --> 04:46:27.312]  I would have waited an eternity for this.
[04:46:27.332 --> 04:46:29.794]  It's over, Prime.
[04:46:30.194 --> 04:46:30.775]  Never!
[04:46:35.117 --> 04:46:35.577]  Never!
[04:46:37.138 --> 04:46:38.920]  How many times have you seen this?
[04:46:38.980 --> 04:46:40.080]  I had a really good memory.
[04:46:40.340 --> 04:46:41.221]  About five times.
[04:46:41.241 --> 04:46:44.263]  Me and Robbie were in a kind of promo and I got ready to do the voiceover every day.
[04:46:46.984 --> 04:46:48.165]  Alright, let's go back to Biden.
[04:46:48.525 --> 04:46:48.646]  Sorry.
[04:46:48.666 --> 04:46:51.787]  This is the most bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States.
[04:46:53.635 --> 04:46:54.515]  Oh yeah, he takes the border.
[04:46:54.535 --> 04:46:55.435]  He's running out of gas, man.
[04:46:55.455 --> 04:47:01.396]  Yeah, but it's like, it's lasting shorter and shorter amounts of time.
[04:47:01.436 --> 04:47:01.897]  My God.
[04:47:01.917 --> 04:47:02.657]  No, I'm serious.
[04:47:02.677 --> 04:47:03.117]  Think about it.
[04:47:03.137 --> 04:47:03.617]  Not a joke.
[04:47:23.417 --> 04:47:25.759]  Ask even the press who doesn't like me, they'll tell you that's true.
[04:47:26.299 --> 04:47:27.760]  The press doesn't like you, Joe?
[04:47:28.140 --> 04:47:32.844]  Typically Trump, once again, putting himself first.
[04:47:33.104 --> 04:47:33.604]  Oh yeah, right.
[04:47:33.644 --> 04:47:34.705]  And America last.
[04:47:36.206 --> 04:47:38.067]  Then I had to take executive action.
[04:47:38.347 --> 04:47:39.248]  Executive action!
[04:47:39.448 --> 04:47:45.072]  As a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%.
[04:47:45.232 --> 04:47:50.596]  In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office.
[04:47:52.853 --> 04:47:56.655]  That only happened two months ago because they shut down for the election.
[04:47:57.596 --> 04:48:01.678]  Their centers are so full they can't even hold them, so they're building more centers.
[04:48:01.698 --> 04:48:02.899]  They're just taking a break.
[04:48:02.919 --> 04:48:06.441]  Wait a minute, I thought she wasn't the Borders are.
[04:48:06.481 --> 04:48:06.961]  Yeah, okay.
[04:48:06.981 --> 04:48:08.221]  That guy can't get his shit together.
[04:48:21.949 --> 04:48:23.110]  Protecting your freedom.
[04:48:24.151 --> 04:48:25.152]  Your freedom to vote.
[04:48:26.553 --> 04:48:28.255]  Your freedom to love who you love.
[04:48:28.275 --> 04:48:32.619]  Whether it's your daughter in the shower.
[04:48:34.080 --> 04:48:35.322]  And your freedom to choose.
[04:48:38.577 --> 04:48:41.898]  Unless you're trying to vote Republican and steal it from me.
[04:48:41.918 --> 04:48:43.939]  Or take him off the ballot.
[04:48:44.019 --> 04:48:45.479]  Alright, guys, you've done great.
[04:48:45.960 --> 04:48:47.320]  I'm wimping out.
[04:48:47.420 --> 04:48:49.061]  I've enjoyed it as much.
[04:48:49.121 --> 04:48:50.041]  Great job of the crew.
[04:48:50.241 --> 04:48:53.262]  We'll have to have a meeting tomorrow about whether we're actually going to carry it.
[04:48:53.302 --> 04:48:55.162]  Tomorrow night... It's the Obamas.
[04:48:55.843 --> 04:48:57.403]  Yeah, we'll have some fun with them.
[04:48:59.664 --> 04:49:03.065]  And then we've got to have Kamala on Thursday, so maybe we cover
[04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:06.971]  Well, what day is the Clintons though?
[04:49:07.011 --> 04:49:07.891]  That's important too.
[04:49:08.772 --> 04:49:11.133]  Bill is on Wednesday with the Walls.
[04:49:11.473 --> 04:49:12.273]  We gotta do every night.
[04:49:12.293 --> 04:49:12.693]  You know what?
[04:49:12.753 --> 04:49:16.295]  I'm gonna put a poll on InfoWars tomorrow whether they want coverage of this or not.
[04:49:17.015 --> 04:49:17.956]  You know how that's gonna go.
[04:49:18.116 --> 04:49:20.837]  It's like when Elon Musk did a poll about whether or not free speech should be on X.
[04:49:21.581 --> 04:49:21.881]  Of course.
[04:49:21.961 --> 04:49:23.182]  Or whether I should be reinstated.
[04:49:23.242 --> 04:49:29.024]  Everybody, if you put a poll on InfoWars whether InfoWars should be live, no matter what we're covering, man, everybody's going to vote that we should be live.
[04:49:29.044 --> 04:49:30.625]  Well, we're going to give them what they want, though.
[04:49:30.725 --> 04:49:32.326]  I think everybody wants to not hear more of Biden.
[04:49:32.346 --> 04:49:33.906]  They have another Transformers clip.
[04:49:33.926 --> 04:49:35.087]  I have no idea what they have, but here it is.
[04:49:37.068 --> 04:49:40.149]  Autobots, prepare to serve the Communist Chinese.
[04:49:40.469 --> 04:49:41.770]  Defeat America.
[04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:44.151]  In fact, imagine I am Optimus Prime.
[04:49:44.171 --> 04:49:45.752]  There are evil Americans.
[04:49:46.012 --> 04:49:47.092]  I must take out Trump.
[04:49:47.732 --> 04:49:48.333]  Bumblebee.
[04:49:49.488 --> 04:49:51.770]  Megatron is actually disguised as Trump.
[04:49:51.850 --> 04:49:55.673]  Take him out, don't let him cut the taxes, and make America great again.
[04:49:56.253 --> 04:50:02.238]  And, yes, we must get the other Autobots to rally against the other Decepticon, Putin.
[04:50:03.599 --> 04:50:05.841]  In fact, maybe they can have him with a Chinese dictator.
[04:50:06.982 --> 04:50:12.446]  He's actually like Optimus Prime, and then Trump's head is on Megatron.
[04:50:13.007 --> 04:50:15.569]  He's like, Prepare to die, Megatron.
[04:50:16.516 --> 04:50:18.238]  And it's, it's the Chinese president.
[04:50:18.858 --> 04:50:19.719]  And then Trump's like, nope.
[04:50:20.039 --> 04:50:21.300]  You will never defeat me.
[04:50:21.340 --> 04:50:22.341]  Where did you guys find this?
[04:50:22.361 --> 04:50:25.164]  Or put Hitler's head on, on, on Megatron.
[04:50:25.184 --> 04:50:26.045]  Put this on X right now.
[04:50:26.085 --> 04:50:26.965]  There's so much stuff.
[04:50:27.005 --> 04:50:28.687]  I hate, I hate John Wayne.
[04:50:29.648 --> 04:50:30.128]  That's it.
[04:50:30.569 --> 04:50:41.659]  The Chinese president's head can be on Optimus Prime and they can resurrect John Wayne and put his head on Megatron and have, and have the Chinese president cut the head off John Wayne.
[04:50:42.796 --> 04:50:43.596]  Kim Jong-un.
[04:50:43.997 --> 04:50:45.917]  Kim Jong-un is Optimus Prime.
[04:50:45.937 --> 04:50:47.498]  Kim Jong-un.
[04:50:48.238 --> 04:50:50.379]  I am here as Optimus Prime to defeat you, Trump.
[04:50:50.659 --> 04:50:52.420]  And then he literally just rips the arms out.
[04:50:52.720 --> 04:50:53.581]  Take this, Trump.
[04:50:54.901 --> 04:50:56.182]  Take that, Megatron Trump.
[04:50:56.602 --> 04:51:01.204]  The Decepticons want control of the Energon Cubes and their leader, Al Gore.
[04:51:01.624 --> 04:51:04.485]  The evil pig walrus, ManBearPig, must be defeated.
[04:51:04.505 --> 04:51:05.546]  Autobots.
[04:51:06.446 --> 04:51:09.948]  Form a battlecruiser and defeat them in the information war.
[04:51:10.468 --> 04:51:11.889]  I am your leader, Optimus Prime.
[04:51:12.329 --> 04:51:13.950]  Autobots transform and murder.
[04:51:14.371 --> 04:51:16.592]  Mile-long Manhattan truck attack kills eight.
[04:51:17.252 --> 04:51:18.553]  I knew it was Megatron.
[04:51:18.573 --> 04:51:22.295]  Wow, what's the name of that video?
[04:51:22.315 --> 04:51:23.556]  I've never seen that before.
[04:51:25.257 --> 04:51:26.658]  Is that not more entertaining than this?
[04:51:30.257 --> 04:51:32.077]  Alex Jones loves Transformers.
[04:51:32.177 --> 04:51:32.958]  That's the caption.
[04:51:33.018 --> 04:51:33.418]  Upload it.
[04:51:34.078 --> 04:51:34.438]  Okay.
[04:51:35.998 --> 04:51:41.979]  Oh, wow.
[04:51:42.259 --> 04:51:42.959]  How old is that?
[04:51:42.980 --> 04:51:43.280]  One like.
[04:51:44.360 --> 04:51:45.280]  Twelve subscribers.
[04:51:45.700 --> 04:51:45.980]  Okay.
[04:51:46.200 --> 04:51:47.480]  Yeah, that's just so many fan videos.
[04:51:47.900 --> 04:51:48.141]  Okay.
[04:51:48.801 --> 04:51:50.121]  Rob Dill, you're still here?
[04:51:50.201 --> 04:51:51.021]  Or Darren McBrain?
[04:51:51.141 --> 04:51:52.101]  They put spoilers.
[04:51:52.221 --> 04:51:53.322]  John Wayne dies.
[04:51:56.545 --> 04:51:58.586]  Oh yeah, the exact headline.
[04:51:59.286 --> 04:52:00.106]  Exact headline.
[04:52:00.827 --> 04:52:03.327]  And then give, oh my gosh, and link to whoever made it.
[04:52:04.248 --> 04:52:05.248]  This looks old, too.
[04:52:05.388 --> 04:52:05.868]  Oh yeah.
[04:52:05.908 --> 04:52:11.450]  Okay, so just, Alex Jones loves Transformers, dash spoilers, John Wayne dies.
[04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:13.671]  Oh my god, that's pure genius.
[04:52:13.711 --> 04:52:16.152]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is how Alex Jones runs his Twitter account.
[04:52:19.284 --> 04:52:21.045]  People are like, he's not on himself.
[04:52:21.105 --> 04:52:22.385]  I'm like, I don't care.
[04:52:22.586 --> 04:52:24.086]  Typos everywhere.
[04:52:24.106 --> 04:52:24.947]  Yeah, right?
[04:52:25.407 --> 04:52:27.408]  It appears Morgan's all pissed off he spelled his name wrong.
[04:52:27.428 --> 04:52:29.209]  Did he really?
[04:52:29.229 --> 04:52:29.529]  Yeah.
[04:52:29.929 --> 04:52:30.649]  It's Piers.
[04:52:30.849 --> 04:52:32.030]  You spelled it Pears, I think.
[04:52:32.050 --> 04:52:36.852]  Oh my God.
[04:52:36.952 --> 04:52:37.893]  It's Piers, Alex.
[04:52:37.913 --> 04:52:38.573]  You're the biggest liar.
[04:52:38.633 --> 04:52:40.454]  Autobots, transform and roll out.
[04:52:40.714 --> 04:52:42.035]  We're battling the Crypt Keeper.
[04:52:42.055 --> 04:52:44.796]  I can't believe he's still talking.
[04:52:45.441 --> 04:52:46.702]  You know they can to keep him powered up.
[04:52:47.382 --> 04:52:48.063]  Oh my gosh.
[04:52:50.184 --> 04:52:53.546]  Now I'm getting really punch drunk here.
[04:52:55.308 --> 04:52:57.609]  Hey, no alcohol for a late night show.
[04:52:57.649 --> 04:52:58.570]  I'm being really good.
[04:53:02.813 --> 04:53:03.253]  Zero.
[04:53:06.615 --> 04:53:08.517]  Yeah, you haven't, you didn't sing move bitch.
[04:53:10.698 --> 04:53:11.158]  That's a good one.
[04:53:11.559 --> 04:53:12.099]  It is a good one.
[04:53:15.578 --> 04:53:17.039]  Let's hear what the Crib Keeper's doing.
[04:53:17.059 --> 04:53:18.100]  Go ahead and fight him out.
[04:53:19.141 --> 04:53:21.763]  Not worthy of being Commander-in-Chief.
[04:53:22.184 --> 04:53:22.644]  Period.
[04:53:23.124 --> 04:53:25.847]  Not then, not now, and not ever.
[04:53:27.768 --> 04:53:28.589]  I mean that.
[04:53:29.710 --> 04:53:31.491]  I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[04:53:31.511 --> 04:53:36.535]  It's like every shot of the audience is a scene from Goonies.
[04:53:36.856 --> 04:53:44.222]  Just as no Commander-in-Chief should ever bow down to a dictator, the way Trump bows down to Putin.
[04:53:45.587 --> 04:53:50.470]  I never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris will never do it.
[04:53:50.490 --> 04:53:52.551]  Hey guys, look up.
[04:53:52.691 --> 04:53:54.032]  Cover commander runs for president.
[04:53:56.173 --> 04:54:00.215]  When Trump left office, Europe and NATO was in tatters.
[04:54:01.096 --> 04:54:01.736]  Not a joke.
[04:54:02.436 --> 04:54:02.977]  Not a joke?
[04:54:02.997 --> 04:54:07.059]  America First Doctrine changed our whole image in the world.
[04:54:09.300 --> 04:54:12.242]  Well, I spent, they gave the hours, about 190 hours sum total.
[04:54:12.262 --> 04:54:12.342]  Okay.
[04:54:14.775 --> 04:54:15.615]  This is wonderful.
[04:54:15.635 --> 04:54:16.156]  I got goosebumps.
[04:54:16.236 --> 04:54:17.777]  I'm getting chills right now.
[04:54:17.877 --> 04:54:18.677]  Old-fashioned Biden, genius.
[04:54:18.697 --> 04:54:20.358]  Old-fashioned Biden, retarded.
[04:54:20.478 --> 04:54:21.559]  Old-fashioned Biden.
[04:54:21.579 --> 04:54:22.839]  Retarded pedophile.
[04:54:22.919 --> 04:54:23.179]  Genius.
[04:54:23.199 --> 04:54:25.301]  For 800 years I've been a pedophile.
[04:54:43.991 --> 04:54:44.851]  Until now.
[04:54:45.772 --> 04:54:46.512]  Until now.
[04:54:46.852 --> 04:54:47.753]  Until now.
[04:54:48.193 --> 04:54:49.653]  We blow up the North Street pipeline.
[04:54:49.673 --> 04:54:50.514]  We attack Russia.
[04:54:50.534 --> 04:54:52.915]  Putin thought he'd take Kiev in three days.
[04:54:53.135 --> 04:54:53.615]  No, he didn't.
[04:54:53.635 --> 04:54:54.115]  He never wanted to.
[04:54:54.135 --> 04:54:56.536]  Three years later, Ukraine is still free!
[04:54:56.836 --> 04:54:57.236]  Successful.
[04:54:57.356 --> 04:55:00.818]  And it's not free.
[04:55:00.838 --> 04:55:01.318]  More horse crap.
[04:55:01.378 --> 04:55:02.278]  Suspended elections.
[04:55:03.259 --> 04:55:04.639]  Banned all their opposition parties.
[04:55:05.119 --> 04:55:06.200]  Closed the Orthodox Church.
[04:55:06.780 --> 04:55:09.241]  When I came to office... Look how tired the people are.
[04:55:09.281 --> 04:55:10.501]  ...the conventional wisdom was.
[04:55:10.521 --> 04:55:11.762]  Todd, I'm tired.
[04:55:12.526 --> 04:55:15.307]  Watching paint dry would be a lot better than this.
[04:55:15.367 --> 04:55:18.249]  Keep talking about ending the war as they start, man.
[04:55:18.269 --> 04:55:19.310]  It's so sickening.
[04:55:19.330 --> 04:55:24.812]  Well, he's shipping more weapons than ever.
[04:55:42.418 --> 04:55:43.139]  As you know.
[04:55:44.239 --> 04:55:45.160]  As you know.
[04:55:46.781 --> 04:55:53.925]  Two days ago, I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to doing that than we've done since October 7th.
[04:55:54.705 --> 04:55:57.527]  We're working around the clock, my Secretary of State.
[04:55:57.947 --> 04:55:58.628]  By the way, it's up.
[04:55:58.688 --> 04:55:59.808]  They got it up so quick.
[04:55:59.968 --> 04:56:02.850]  So proud of Rob and McBreeny and everybody else.
[04:56:03.170 --> 04:56:04.751]  Alex Jones loves Transformers.
[04:56:04.771 --> 04:56:05.392]  Spoilers.
[04:56:05.992 --> 04:56:07.153]  John Wayne dies.
[04:56:09.434 --> 04:56:10.755]  It's up on Real Alex Jones, folks.
[04:56:11.724 --> 04:56:12.404]  We now share it.
[04:56:12.424 --> 04:56:14.565]  Civilian suffering of the Palestinian people.
[04:56:15.645 --> 04:56:21.106]  And finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire and end this war!
[04:56:23.186 --> 04:56:33.148]  End this war that we gave them money to attack and Israel stood down.
[04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:34.608]  This is brutal.
[04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:36.948]  Those protesters out on the street have a point.
[04:56:37.629 --> 04:56:38.029]  We voted.
[04:56:38.049 --> 04:56:39.029]  This is what democracy does.
[04:56:41.052 --> 04:56:41.513]  There it is.
[04:56:56.380 --> 04:56:59.101]  Welcome back to InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:56:59.161 --> 04:57:04.862]  We're now joined by humanitarian and overall trendy Cobra Commander.
[04:57:04.922 --> 04:57:09.003]  He is an international terrorist, a dictator over third world countries.
[04:57:09.643 --> 04:57:20.185]  He's involved in bioweapons, weapon sales, and now in the modern America and modern world where torture, secret arrest, TSA, groping your children's genitals is what the good guys do.
[04:57:20.905 --> 04:57:22.447]  I thought we'd have him on.
[04:57:22.988 --> 04:57:35.762]  I know the media reaches out to Cobra Commander or Cobra Leader quite often and he refuses to come on, but he has agreed to do this interview because he has a big announcement tonight to make.
[04:57:36.503 --> 04:57:39.864]  Uh, to the people that live in this 1984 society.
[04:57:40.304 --> 04:57:46.986]  And again, if you're not with, uh, the Cobra Leader, or Mr. Cobra, uh, then, uh, you're not, uh, a modern trendy.
[04:57:47.486 --> 04:57:50.687]  So I want to thank him for joining us this evening.
[04:57:51.127 --> 04:57:59.689]  Uh, Mr. Cobra, and associate, um, I guess minion, coming from North Korea, uh, thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[04:57:59.909 --> 04:58:01.971]  You pathetic little worm!
[04:58:02.111 --> 04:58:05.734]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[04:58:06.515 --> 04:58:10.378]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[04:58:11.158 --> 04:58:15.942]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[04:58:16.503 --> 04:58:22.468]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[04:58:24.033 --> 04:58:26.141]  You pathetic little worm!
[04:58:26.281 --> 04:58:28.871]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[04:58:32.208 --> 04:58:47.154]  Your Supreme Excellency, Your Graciousness, Your Royal Highness, Cobra Commander, I should give you the same attention that other mass murderers get who run empires, like the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II.
[04:58:47.374 --> 04:58:48.694]  I apologize.
[04:58:49.555 --> 04:58:56.918]  The corporate media for a long time has wondered who you actually are, and since I got your title wrong, will you please tell us
[04:58:57.999 --> 04:59:01.250]  Who you are, sir, because tyranny is so trendy right now.
[04:59:01.632 --> 04:59:03.840]  Why not reveal yourself, your lordship?
[04:59:05.839 --> 04:59:09.002]  None of your pathetic business, worm!
[04:59:09.442 --> 04:59:10.784]  Submit to me!
[04:59:10.804 --> 04:59:16.389]  Even this gentleman here to my left is a servant of Cobra!
[04:59:16.829 --> 04:59:20.272]  For decades you've known him as the real Cobra Commander!
[04:59:20.873 --> 04:59:31.383]  Only now am I letting you pathetic people know that it is I, the true Cobra Commander, who have ruled from behind the scenes!
[04:59:33.072 --> 04:59:37.434]  Man, and I always liked the Bill of Rights and Constitution and due process.
[04:59:38.034 --> 04:59:39.114]  It is so cool.
[04:59:39.174 --> 04:59:40.535]  You just are talking down to me.
[04:59:41.415 --> 04:59:42.936]  Now I know how other Americans feel.
[04:59:42.976 --> 04:59:44.416]  We like being slaves.
[04:59:45.897 --> 04:59:46.777]  Thank you, sir.
[04:59:47.177 --> 04:59:48.437]  I've got so many other questions.
[04:59:48.838 --> 04:59:51.158]  Thank you for giving us this big, gracious interview.
[04:59:53.159 --> 04:59:55.560]  Miss Napolitano, I'm sorry to reveal your identity.
[04:59:55.620 --> 04:59:56.260]  I mean, forget that.
[04:59:57.241 --> 04:59:57.921]  Cobra Commander,
[04:59:59.259 --> 05:00:01.481]  Why are you agreeing to this interview?
[05:00:01.501 --> 05:00:04.163]  You said you had some special announcement for us.
[05:00:04.904 --> 05:00:07.346]  Please tell us what that is, sir.
[05:00:08.087 --> 05:00:08.988]  I am the leader.
[05:00:09.428 --> 05:00:10.909]  I am Cobra Commander.
[05:00:11.290 --> 05:00:16.915]  I have agreed to this interview so that you might know that I have decided to go public.
[05:00:17.515 --> 05:00:22.597]  And to have a public stock offering in Cobra Global Enterprises.
[05:00:23.278 --> 05:00:26.159]  I intend to issue my own fiat currency.
[05:00:26.579 --> 05:00:36.864]  But before I do that, I intend to sue Homeland Security for copyright and trademark infringement.
[05:00:37.424 --> 05:00:38.965]  Black uniforms.
[05:00:39.465 --> 05:00:40.626]  Black uniforms.
[05:00:41.366 --> 05:01:09.174]  Ski masks, checkpoints, black armored tanks on the streets, preemptive war, torture, wireless wiretapping, total tyranny is the new freedom that Cobra has taught the world, and now Joe and the Pentagon have stolen my plan and hired Al Qaeda to carry out their operations in Libya, which they formerly did for me!
[05:01:10.414 --> 05:01:17.459]  Now, clearly, America and the rest of the system has realized that I am the true visionary.
[05:01:17.939 --> 05:01:27.245]  And so I now announce to you and the world the greatest moment in the history of Cobra!
[05:01:27.665 --> 05:01:29.426]  Cobra!
[05:01:31.774 --> 05:01:43.543]  I will now sit for president and run on the Republican Party ticket against that plagiarer Barack Obama that's stolen so many of my ideas!
[05:01:44.921 --> 05:01:56.072]  Clearly an America that loves indefinite detention and the NDAA and torture and secret arrest is ready to be ruled by a true tyrant!
[05:01:56.873 --> 05:02:01.137]  I was a snake, an oppressor before it was cool!
[05:02:01.678 --> 05:02:03.380]  Hail Cobra!
[05:02:03.680 --> 05:02:04.501]  Cobra!
[05:02:05.121 --> 05:02:08.362]  I am running for President of the United States!
[05:02:08.942 --> 05:02:15.924]  And from America, I will congenial the policy of global corporate war against the third world!
[05:02:16.644 --> 05:02:17.884]  Death and destruction!
[05:02:18.364 --> 05:02:19.905]  Forced inoculations!
[05:02:20.225 --> 05:02:21.505]  Hail Cobra!
[05:02:21.925 --> 05:02:24.426]  Well, you're obviously keeping us safe from terrorists.
[05:02:24.606 --> 05:02:26.086]  I just only have a few more questions.
[05:02:26.146 --> 05:02:32.908]  Your supreme helper-nesses, official-nesses, authority is a powerful government.
[05:02:33.965 --> 05:02:37.091]  I know that you are a humanitarian and care about the population.
[05:02:37.512 --> 05:02:38.954]  What about climate change?
[05:02:38.994 --> 05:02:41.639]  What about carbon taxes that are being implemented?
[05:02:41.980 --> 05:02:45.827]  Where does COBRA as an organization stand on that, sir?
[05:02:47.046 --> 05:02:52.750]  As your future president, I agree with Al Gore.
[05:02:53.290 --> 05:03:04.578]  To be able to breathe or engage in any activity, you will pay not Gore, but me, your Supreme Leader, money to breathe.
[05:03:05.318 --> 05:03:11.322]  If you want to engage in any activity, you will get permission from Cobra.
[05:03:11.843 --> 05:03:16.346]  And I now have a giant Homeland Security bureaucracy.
[05:03:17.647 --> 05:03:23.552]  And police wearing Cobra uniforms who are ready to strike fear into the slaves.
[05:03:24.092 --> 05:03:29.256]  Let's cut back to Joe Biden, and I'm from Cobra Commander, so it's about to end.
[05:03:30.057 --> 05:03:31.498]  By the way, the crew's in there watching it.
[05:03:31.939 --> 05:03:35.542]  Has he mentioned Kamala once, what a great motorist she was?
[05:03:35.582 --> 05:03:40.005]  This narcissist doesn't know when to quit or leave.
[05:03:40.065 --> 05:03:41.206]  But she'll be a president!
[05:03:41.226 --> 05:03:42.868]  And I've seen his statements about, we're gonna win.
[05:03:42.888 --> 05:03:44.049]  Our children can look up to.
[05:03:45.367 --> 05:03:49.790]  She'll be a president respected by world leaders because she already is.
[05:03:50.611 --> 05:03:52.572]  She'll be a president we can all be proud of.
[05:03:53.813 --> 05:03:58.137]  And she will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.
[05:03:58.157 --> 05:04:07.183]  This will be the first presidential election since January 6th.
[05:04:08.684 --> 05:04:14.749]  On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country.
[05:04:15.868 --> 05:04:18.209]  Worse than Pearl Harbor!
[05:04:18.249 --> 05:04:21.051]  This is not hyperbole, that threat is still very much alive.
[05:04:22.452 --> 05:04:28.235]  Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again.
[05:04:28.255 --> 05:04:30.396]  He didn't say that, he said there's fraud, he'll expose it.
[05:04:31.057 --> 05:04:31.357]  Boo!
[05:04:31.377 --> 05:04:32.498]  Think about that.
[05:04:32.998 --> 05:04:34.018]  He means it, think about that.
[05:04:34.038 --> 05:04:36.600]  Biden said there won't be peaceful- As if, no, he's over the top.
[05:04:36.640 --> 05:04:37.440]  Not bad, yeah.
[05:04:38.641 --> 05:04:40.022]  If he loses in his words.
[05:04:41.437 --> 05:04:41.957]  Also tongue-in-cheek.
[05:04:41.977 --> 05:04:44.799]  He said only— To say, drill, baby, drill.
[05:04:44.839 --> 05:04:45.900]  Right, and it was tongue-in-cheek.
[05:04:46.420 --> 05:04:49.982]  He said, I'll do one thing day one, turn the drilling back on.
[05:05:04.318 --> 05:05:08.902]  Folks, all of us carry a special obligation.
[05:05:09.723 --> 05:05:11.744]  Independents, Republicans, Democrats.
[05:05:13.105 --> 05:05:17.309]  We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024.
[05:05:17.389 --> 05:05:30.560]  The vote of each of us cast this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail.
[05:05:31.481 --> 05:05:32.302]  It's that simple.
[05:05:33.243 --> 05:05:34.244]  It's that serious.
[05:05:35.284 --> 05:05:37.265]  And the power is literally in your hands.
[05:05:38.246 --> 05:05:41.688]  He's literally admitting that democracy has the power to elect tyranny.
[05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:42.529]  Not hyperbole.
[05:05:42.889 --> 05:05:43.689]  It's in your hands.
[05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:45.691]  America's future is in your hands.
[05:05:45.731 --> 05:05:49.193]  Let me close with this.
[05:05:51.114 --> 05:05:56.297]  Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter... Oh my God.
[05:05:56.317 --> 05:05:59.479]  ...in God's beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, claim on Delaware.
[05:06:01.058 --> 05:06:03.799]  Grow up to sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.
[05:06:11.800 --> 05:06:18.601]  That's because America is and always has been a nation of possibilities.
[05:06:19.901 --> 05:06:20.722]  Possibilities.
[05:06:21.622 --> 05:06:22.882]  We must never lose that.
[05:06:24.042 --> 05:06:24.342]  Never.
[05:06:26.523 --> 05:06:27.883]  Kamala and Tim understand.
[05:06:29.121 --> 05:06:31.863]  That this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities.
[05:06:32.744 --> 05:06:34.685]  Not just for the few of us, but for all of us.
[05:06:36.687 --> 05:06:40.750]  So join me in promising your whole heart to this effort.
[05:06:42.352 --> 05:06:49.737]  And where my heart will be, I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walsh have ever seen.
[05:06:49.777 --> 05:06:50.798]  And smell everybody, yeah.
[05:06:53.020 --> 05:06:53.941]  The liar asshole.
[05:06:53.961 --> 05:06:57.724]  Yeah, Tim Walsh punching his face.
[05:06:58.414 --> 05:07:02.956]  Each of us has a part in the American story.
[05:07:04.196 --> 05:07:10.859]  For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us, that captures the best of who we are as a nation.
[05:07:11.839 --> 05:07:13.940]  The song is called American Anthem.
[05:07:15.201 --> 05:07:20.343]  There's one verse that stands out, and I can't sing worth a damn, so I'm not going to try.
[05:07:22.363 --> 05:07:23.144]  I'll just quote it.
[05:07:24.444 --> 05:07:26.165]  The work and prayers of centuries
[05:07:27.239 --> 05:07:28.521]  Have brought us to this day.
[05:07:30.282 --> 05:07:32.345]  What shall our legacy be?
[05:07:33.406 --> 05:07:34.627]  What will our children say?
[05:07:36.129 --> 05:07:39.593]  Let me know in my heart what my days are through.
[05:07:40.714 --> 05:07:44.879]  America, America, I gave my best to you.
[05:07:57.002 --> 05:07:57.602]  What'd you say?
[05:07:58.623 --> 05:08:03.388]  Oh yeah, look at all those empty seats.
[05:08:03.408 --> 05:08:05.389]  It's torture, man.
[05:08:05.450 --> 05:08:07.892]  I don't know if we're gonna cover the rest of it.
[05:08:08.632 --> 05:08:09.874]  I mean, we need to cover some of it.
[05:08:10.815 --> 05:08:13.497]  God Almighty.
[05:08:13.937 --> 05:08:17.601]  Maybe we'll go to it right before, like, you know, Obama and all them speak.
[05:08:19.209 --> 05:08:20.170]  It's still so boring.
[05:08:20.210 --> 05:08:21.673]  I thought of this on the fly.
[05:08:21.713 --> 05:08:22.975]  I think it's some really funny stuff.
[05:08:34.335 --> 05:08:37.496]  Too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet.
[05:08:37.936 --> 05:08:39.037]  I mean, objectively, right?
[05:08:39.057 --> 05:08:40.157]  We're not being biased here.
[05:08:40.177 --> 05:08:42.558]  Objectively, this is way worse than the RNC, isn't it?
[05:08:44.299 --> 05:08:52.002]  We could run a separate feed on X and have a vote, just like animals, like pigs and horses and goats crapping.
[05:08:52.202 --> 05:08:54.502]  And we'd probably have more views than this.
[05:08:55.143 --> 05:08:55.843]  Like a manure cam?
[05:08:55.883 --> 05:08:56.723]  I think we'd have more views.
[05:09:04.744 --> 05:09:07.445]  Or like a time-lapse of, like, maggots eating a dead possum.
[05:09:07.525 --> 05:09:09.305]  It's like Saturday detention in high school.
[05:09:09.765 --> 05:09:09.985]  Yeah.
[05:09:13.006 --> 05:09:13.646]  That's what Biden's like.
[05:09:13.666 --> 05:09:15.387]  It's like a dead possum covered in maggots.
[05:09:15.887 --> 05:09:19.588]  And a gravy of, uh, rotting guts.
[05:09:21.348 --> 05:09:23.109]  Well, it sounds like good Indian cuisine.
[05:09:23.229 --> 05:09:24.729]  Oh, thank God it's over.
[05:09:24.889 --> 05:09:25.670]  Oh, thank you, Lord.
[05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:26.070]  Oh.
[05:09:26.950 --> 05:09:27.030]  Oh.
[05:09:32.130 --> 05:09:34.092]  Well, they admitted they paid basically everybody in the crowd.
[05:09:34.132 --> 05:09:35.173]  They're all influencers.
[05:09:35.193 --> 05:09:36.314]  Look at him.
[05:09:36.394 --> 05:09:38.336]  Jill's got to run up on stage and walk him.
[05:09:38.356 --> 05:09:39.597]  Because he can't walk.
[05:09:39.617 --> 05:09:40.638]  He's been on his feet too long.
[05:09:41.298 --> 05:09:42.379]  Look at those platform shoes.
[05:09:46.443 --> 05:09:47.784]  These are all wannabe movie stars.
[05:09:48.705 --> 05:09:50.107]  I know a lot of big quote stars.
[05:09:50.127 --> 05:09:52.529]  They said these politicians grovel to them.
[05:09:52.909 --> 05:09:53.570]  They just love it.
[05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:54.771]  They wannabe stars, man.
[05:09:56.761 --> 05:09:57.842]  Well, it's over.
[05:09:58.222 --> 05:09:58.963]  Oh, thank God.
[05:09:59.003 --> 05:10:01.646]  I'll see you guys in less than nine hours.
[05:10:01.766 --> 05:10:03.007]  Hey, great job to the crew.
[05:10:03.027 --> 05:10:03.087]  8 a.m.
[05:10:03.547 --> 05:10:04.228]  American Journal.
[05:10:05.109 --> 05:10:05.689]  You're doing that.
[05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:09.913]  Owen's on vacation taking care of his turtle, which is fine.
[05:10:09.933 --> 05:10:10.634]  He deserves the time.
[05:10:11.755 --> 05:10:12.135]  Seriously.
[05:10:12.475 --> 05:10:16.900]  And then we've got Paris that's going to be doing the war room tomorrow.
[05:10:17.280 --> 05:10:18.701]  Yeah, I'm doing the journal.
[05:10:21.425 --> 05:10:21.745]  I don't know.
[05:10:21.765 --> 05:10:22.866]  We had some fun tonight.
[05:10:22.906 --> 05:10:23.427]  And you know what?
[05:10:23.467 --> 05:10:24.788]  We reached a ton of people.
[05:10:24.888 --> 05:10:26.830]  Not just the live stream, but the clips are going viral.
[05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:30.553]  It was a pleasure to see you see a clip made about you for the first time.
[05:10:31.314 --> 05:10:33.335]  The Transformers with a spoiler.
[05:10:33.375 --> 05:10:33.956]  That was fun.
[05:10:33.976 --> 05:10:35.157]  I love the fans.
[05:10:35.177 --> 05:10:35.697]  They're the best.
[05:10:37.999 --> 05:10:39.140]  What is this shot of the DMC?
[05:10:41.843 --> 05:10:46.467]  Let's watch him walk over it real quick.
[05:10:47.187 --> 05:10:47.948]  Yeah, he might fall.
[05:10:48.108 --> 05:10:48.929]  We don't want to miss a fall.
[05:10:50.396 --> 05:10:51.297]  No Hunter to be found.
[05:10:51.317 --> 05:10:52.897]  They cut away when they got to lead him off.
[05:10:53.778 --> 05:10:54.398]  Oh, there he is.
[05:10:54.939 --> 05:10:55.479]  There's Hunter.
[05:10:56.099 --> 05:10:56.980]  Cracked out of his head.
[05:10:59.461 --> 05:11:00.422]  Chai Com traders.
[05:11:00.442 --> 05:11:00.822]  Waltz.
[05:11:00.942 --> 05:11:02.083]  All of them are Chai Com traders.
[05:11:03.583 --> 05:11:04.784]  Literal Chai Com traders.
[05:11:04.804 --> 05:11:06.065]  All right.
[05:11:06.105 --> 05:11:06.965]  Great job, crew.
[05:11:07.145 --> 05:11:08.506]  Infowarstore.com, folks.
[05:11:08.546 --> 05:11:09.447]  Take the clip, share them.
[05:11:09.727 --> 05:11:10.587]  We love the audience.
[05:11:10.828 --> 05:11:12.308]  Activists, you are the Paul Reveres.
[05:11:13.089 --> 05:11:15.150]  Good night, good luck, and we'll see you back.
[05:11:15.210 --> 05:11:16.731]  Hopefully there's not World War III in the morning.
[05:11:39.497 --> 05:11:40.138]  I'm a hummingbird.
[05:11:40.258 --> 05:11:42.740]  All right.
[05:11:43.040 --> 05:11:44.881]  Oh, there's Kamala.
[05:11:44.901 --> 05:11:46.583]  Look at that cackling witch.
[05:11:48.865 --> 05:11:52.888]  That's some Trump dance.
[05:11:53.969 --> 05:11:55.650]  It's like whack-a-mole.
[05:11:56.111 --> 05:11:56.571]  Whack.
[05:11:57.031 --> 05:11:57.492]  Whack.
[05:11:57.972 --> 05:11:58.412]  Whack.
[05:12:03.617 --> 05:12:06.259]  Hey, was our coverage not more entertaining?
[05:12:19.591 --> 05:12:25.134]  People like the late night stuff we do, because that can get weird.
[05:12:26.295 --> 05:12:27.096]  Yeah, let's do that.
[05:12:27.196 --> 05:12:29.217]  Oh, that old Blue Beam thing they just did?
[05:12:29.497 --> 05:12:31.078]  Look, they can't get him off the stage.
[05:12:31.098 --> 05:12:32.199]  Look, Kamala's trying to hold his hand.
[05:12:32.219 --> 05:12:33.720]  He's, like, stumbling off.
[05:12:33.840 --> 05:12:35.501]  Look at that.
[05:12:35.521 --> 05:12:37.502]  He's like a retarded penguin.
[05:12:38.503 --> 05:12:40.724]  Look at him.
[05:12:40.744 --> 05:12:42.685]  He has no idea where he's at.
[05:12:42.745 --> 05:12:43.386]  He just wants power.
[05:12:57.125 --> 05:13:00.046]  That makes us really sick.
[05:13:00.106 --> 05:13:04.428]  But people are all leaving.
[05:13:04.448 --> 05:13:13.012]  Look at all the empties.
[05:13:14.112 --> 05:13:14.513]  That's it.
[05:13:14.553 --> 05:13:15.373]  He served evil.
[05:13:16.333 --> 05:13:17.694]  Now all the power is going away.
[05:13:17.714 --> 05:13:19.415]  Stolen election.
[05:13:19.435 --> 05:13:20.575]  He'll always be known as a fraud.
[05:13:20.855 --> 05:13:21.796]  Trump.
[05:13:23.487 --> 05:13:24.468]  Barely missed death.
[05:13:24.908 --> 05:13:26.009]  He's a super icon now.
[05:13:26.029 --> 05:13:27.150]  You're a total joke, Joe Biden.
[05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:29.411]  You're a scumbag, chi-com, filthy family.
[05:13:29.871 --> 05:13:31.953]  Let's watch him go into that orifice and disappear.
[05:13:33.274 --> 05:13:34.254]  Bye-bye, scumbags.
[05:13:34.955 --> 05:13:36.236]  We'll beat these people one way or another.
[05:13:36.296 --> 05:13:37.376]  Thanks for your backing, Listers.
[05:13:37.757 --> 05:13:39.478]  Good night and good luck!
