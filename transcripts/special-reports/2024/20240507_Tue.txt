[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.230]  We immediately surge to the border.
[00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.510]  Surge to the border.
[00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.350]  Surge to the border.
[00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:14.012]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:16.693]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:17.893]  I want to hit Biden.
[00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:21.434]  And I should have covered this the whole show.
[00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.594]  I mean, this is over the top.
[00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:25.675]  Biden gets rid of the border three and a half years ago.
[00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.011]  20 million people are here.
[00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.052]  That's the real number.
[00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:30.412]  22 million.
[00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:32.634]  They're slaves of the globalists.
[00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.574]  New permanent underclass.
[00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:36.096]  He tells them immediately surge the border if he wins.
[00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:36.617]  They get here.
[00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:38.278]  He says, oh, the border's not broken.
[00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:39.359]  He says, oh, it is broken.
[00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:40.499]  Pass amnesty.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.923]  And then yesterday he comes out and says, oh, we can't have it illegal to come here.
[00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:46.604]  It's moral.
[00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:47.625]  This is totally open.
[00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:57.132]  And then it goes into the other clips where border agents concede control of the New Mexico border to cartel
[00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:03.869]  And then, Denver wants you to host an, quote, migrant family.
[00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.011]  A Democrat Party voter group that they're gonna give jobs, give welfare, then control.
[00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.452]  And Milk, hear those clips back-to-back.
[00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:18.694]  Can you imagine a kid two years old saying, Mom, don't take me for granted, it's against the law.
[00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:19.894]  Give me a break.
[00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:21.895]  These have been model citizens.
[00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.289]  I'm proud to have served with him.
[00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.870]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.952]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:36.973]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.213]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:39.073]  That's who we are.
[00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:43.255]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:49.629]  We want to show you this new video from the southern border in Sunland Park, New Mexico.
[00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:55.133]  Just a few hours ago, our cameras caught this group walking into the country, led by cartel guides.
[00:01:55.654 --> 00:02:02.098]  One border patrol agent there told our own Matt Finn, that mountain, which is in the United States, isn't ours anymore.
[00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.220]  It belongs to the cartels.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.925]  That stretch of the border has been one of the busiest sectors over this past week, with more than a thousand people a day coming across.
[00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:19.385]  Now, if you're interested in learning more about hosting a migrant family, all you gotta do is take out your phone, dial 2-1-1, it's as easy as that.
[00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:29.658]  You're gonna be asked a few questions, things along the lines of how long are you able to host somebody, what kind of space are you available to provide, and Kettering says you can expect that phone call to last about 20 minutes.
[00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:31.760]  Reporting live in Denver, Nate Powell, FOX 31.
[00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:39.486]  That's happening all across the country in all 50 states, and they sign them up on welfare, give you a small sliver of it, and then the Democratic Party gets the rest of it.
[00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:40.626]  Organized racketeering.
[00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.887]  But back to the first Biden clip from yesterday.
[00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:47.929]  Can you imagine a kid two years old saying, Mom, don't take me across Rio Grande.
[00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:48.809]  It's against the law.
[00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.010]  Give me a break.
[00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.030]  These have been model citizens.
[00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.652]  Can you imagine a kid two years old saying, Mom, don't take me across Rio Grande.
[00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:57.533]  It's against the law.
[00:02:57.973 --> 00:02:58.733]  Give me a break.
[00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:00.734]  These have been model citizens.
[00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:07.686]  I could teach an entire rhetoric class just on that 10-second clip.
[00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:15.912]  Imagine telling a kid it's illegal to come across the border, which it is, which he's made legal by fiat, and they're model citizens.
[00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:18.233]  They're citizens the minute they get here.
[00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:22.817]  Think about the magnitude.
[00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.085]  Of what he just said.
[00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.205]  The lawlessness of it.
[00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:27.606]  But they're going to grab your junk.
[00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:28.507]  They're going to search your family.
[00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.628]  They're going to put you through a body scanner at the airport.
[00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:33.910]  But the border is wide open.
[00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.711]  Absolutely insane.
[00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:38.433]  They stole the election three and a half years ago.
[00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:40.835]  They're planning to steal it again.
[00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:46.518]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.040]  But this is the last gasp all over the world.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.382]  83% was the number I saw last week.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:06.892]  In regional, local, national elections from Australia to El Salvador to you name it, Europe, patriots are getting elected.
[00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:08.834]  That's why the system is so scared.
[00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:15.380]  All right, we're going to air a short clip of our guest, a medical coder at a medical facility.
[00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:22.121]  That's like the air traffic controller that will go to her live for the balance of the hour straight ahead.
[00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:23.623]  Please spread the word.
[00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:24.885]  Have folks tune in now.
[00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:25.946]  This is important.
[00:04:26.207 --> 00:04:26.868]  I'm counting on you.
[00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.168]  This is so, so important.
