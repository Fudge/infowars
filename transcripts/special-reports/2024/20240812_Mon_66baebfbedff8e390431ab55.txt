[00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.970]  Is New York's Donald Trump running for president?
[00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:15.354]  He bought full-page ads in three East Coast newspapers today, stating his views on foreign policy, and these ads will win him a following.
[00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:23.038]  In the ads he says, there's nothing wrong with American foreign policy, that little backbone won't cure.
[00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:30.761]  And he says, we have no business spending ourselves broke in the Middle East, protecting ships that are not ours.
[00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:32.537]  And oil that we don't need.
[00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.298]  Rumblings in the Trump camp point as far as the presidency.
[00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.498]  Somebody has to help this country.
[00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:40.699]  And if they don't, the country and the world are in big trouble.
[00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:46.500]  Because within a short period of time, as sure as we're sitting here, there's not going to be a country and there's not going to be a world.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.601]  I have no intention of running for president.
[00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.161]  And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally.
[00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:58.323]  Together we will determine the course of America.
[00:00:58.703 --> 00:00:59.403]  And the world.
[00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.393]  For many, many years to come.
[00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:15.103]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:21.828]  That all changes, starting right here and right now.
[00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.011]  Because this moment is your moment.
[00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:26.853]  It belongs to you.
[00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:35.505]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:39.707]  Trump leading in five of the six most important battleground states.
[00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:41.828]  Biden continues to trail Donald Trump.
[00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:47.650]  Our latest polling out of Iowa also shows former President Trump with a 30 point lead over his newest rival.
[00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.271]  The Republican primary is over.
[00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:52.732]  Donald Trump basically has this nomination locked up.
[00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.155]  Everyone is listening to you now.
[00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:11.684]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.
[00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:16.248]  My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over.
[00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.252]  In fact, our fight has only just begun.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:25.631]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the fight is on.
[00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:26.452]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:30.897]  Chase Geiser joins me in studio here for this live emergency broadcast.
[00:02:31.377 --> 00:02:34.721]  We are one hour away from the interview.
[00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.683]  Elon Musk and Donald Trump.
[00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:39.686]  Donald Trump has returned to Twitter at long last.
[00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.928]  He was kicked off of Twitter on January 6th, of course, 2021.
[00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.830]  Remained off of that social media platform, created Truth Social.
[00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.133]  Despite calls from many people, myself included, he has remained off of X until now, and he has returned.
[00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:59.615]  And we're looking very forward to this conversation between Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.556]  Chase, what are you expecting for today's broadcast?
[00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:11.525]  Well one of the things that I really like about this that I was thinking about earlier was if this was a traditional television interview it would be from 7 p.m.
[00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:12.526]  until 8 p.m.
[00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:19.892]  Central with with commercial breaks or a hard end and I love how it's just open like they're gonna start talking at 7 p.m.
[00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:28.560]  and who knows how long they'll go for right it's it's this long-form thing and we don't we haven't seen Donald Trump really in this context of just
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.942]  Having a conversation with someone that's indefinite.
[00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.024]  He's never done a Joe Rogan podcast or anything like that.
[00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:39.610]  So to see him actually just hang out in a space for an indefinite amount of time is really exciting for me.
[00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:42.963]  Well, and it's also, you know, Elon Musk is not a media personality.
[00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:44.524]  He doesn't have talking points.
[00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:46.986]  He's a corporatist, right?
[00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.066]  He's a magnate.
[00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:50.748]  But that'll be interesting as well.
[00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.233]  I feel like people treat Elon sort of the same way that they treat Trump, where they act like he's just a celebrity for celebrity's sake.
[00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:00.155]  But it's like, no, these guys are world famous.
[00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:02.336]  Elon Musk is the richest man in the world.
[00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:06.339]  I don't know where he stands now, but he's certainly in the top three.
[00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.760]  That's real power.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.720]  That's real influence.
[00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:13.629]  A really unique individual to be talking to, Donald Trump.
[00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.732]  I wonder if they'll let other people speak.
[00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:20.234]  What do you think the odds are that they'll open up the space to other speakers?
[00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:26.539]  I'm doubtful unless they've made arrangements prior to the start of this space as to who they're going to allow to speak.
[00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.421]  Because you don't want to just let anybody come in and start blaring, right?
[00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.922]  That'd be fun, I don't know!
[00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:35.045]  We like to do that here at InfoWars, but we're not running for President of the United States.
[00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:35.305]  True.
[00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.646]  Offending an assassination attempt, right?
[00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.327]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.668]  Yeah, so it's possible.
[00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:45.851]  I know Musk put out a post asking for people to submit questions that they had that they would like Elon to ask.
[00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:53.695]  I'm sure that he analyzed the thousands upon thousands of responses that he got and sorted based on the most common questions that people wanted to hear.
[00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.037]  It's fascinating to me that you mentioned, I hadn't thought of it before, Harrison.
[00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:02.580]  Imagine never doing an interview before and your first guest is Donald Trump.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.622]  You're right, he's never interviewed anybody else before that I'm aware of.
[00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:10.663]  Sure tell you can just do that stuff when you are the richest man in the world.
[00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:16.766]  But it's not even just because he's the richest man in the world, it's because he is, I think, the most influential man in the world, right?
[00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:17.267]  Oh, for sure.
[00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:29.292]  Obviously, Tesla, SpaceX have been huge successes, but since he bought Twitter and turned it into X, this is the last platform with critical mass, with the user base that it has.
[00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:32.394]  I mean, there are other great platforms like Gab or Getter, but we're talking about
[00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:36.257]  Hundreds of millions of people throughout the world on this platform.
[00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:41.040]  This is the last place on the internet where there really is free speech to this extent at least.
[00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:41.381]  Yeah.
[00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.083]  And so that's what makes this a really important time.
[00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:48.647]  And I know that Trump, if he wanted to come back to Twitter, he wouldn't half-ass it.
[00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:52.830]  He wouldn't just all of a sudden start tweeting again and people would be like, oh I guess he's back.
[00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.230]  Right.
[00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.852]  You have to make a show out of it.
[00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:56.053]  He's an entertainer.
[00:05:56.093 --> 00:06:00.977]  He understands marketing and press and public relations very well, intimately.
[00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:06.882]  And this is him saying, all right, we know that as a campaign strategy, we need to start using this platform again.
[00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:09.424]  And if we're going to come back and do it, we need to do it in a big way.
[00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:16.831]  So why don't we have the most controversial person who actually runs the platform interview the most controversial political candidate perhaps in political history.
[00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:19.073]  No, it is really fascinating.
[00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:21.995]  There's so many aspects to this that are worth getting into.
[00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:26.319]  Obviously, the UK, or the EU rather, is really not happy about this.
[00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:30.202]  They sent out a letter basically threatening Elon Musk not to interview Donald Trump.
[00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:30.983]  Totally absurd.
[00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:35.367]  Totally blatant foreign interference in an American election.
[00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:36.608]  Attempted interference at least.
[00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:40.070]  The fact that Elon Musk has
[00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:48.727]  You've opened up the platform so much and people are still not, you know, totally happy with it, but it's like, do you remember what X used to be like?
[00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:55.352]  Do you remember how it used to be that you couldn't say anything without fear of your entire account just being axed with no warning?
[00:06:55.452 --> 00:06:57.193]  I mean, it was bad before.
[00:06:57.353 --> 00:06:59.334]  It is significantly better now.
[00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:03.597]  Have you ever gone back and looked at your drafts from the pre-X era?
[00:07:04.338 --> 00:07:04.598]  No.
[00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:09.061]  So I would type things and then I would look at it and I would analyze, would this get me banned?
[00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:09.521]  Right.
[00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:12.262]  And if it would, I wouldn't delete it, I would save it as a draft.
[00:07:12.302 --> 00:07:12.602]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:15.503]  And I've gone back and looked and there were some re-bankers in there, right?
[00:07:15.543 --> 00:07:17.404]  But so many of them we could say now, right?
[00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:17.704]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.685]  Like you couldn't even use the word retard back then, right?
[00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:19.885]  Right.
[00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:21.405]  On X and you would get suspended.
[00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:27.267]  And I used to do this thing where I would donate $5 to ARC, which is the Association of Retarded Citizens.
[00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:31.429]  It's just called ARC now because retarded is now an antiquated term.
[00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:32.169]  Right, right.
[00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.910]  But if you donated in someone's name, it would show up on their feed.
[00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.371]  Like, oh, you know, $5 was donated in the name.
[00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:43.693]  So I would donate $5 to ARK and then take a screenshot of the name of the person and then reply because I couldn't call him a retard.
[00:07:43.873 --> 00:07:48.015]  That's like the most passive-aggressive charity I've ever heard of.
[00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:48.775]  Right?
[00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:53.057]  But the era of self-censorship is virtually over on the platform.
[00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:59.902]  Well, and you know, the cool thing about Spaces, obviously, is, and I think you're right, I doubt they're just gonna let anybody up, but they could.
[00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:00.403]  Right.
[00:08:00.443 --> 00:08:01.623]  But they potentially could.
[00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:05.526]  And that is the interesting thing, is everybody's gonna be tuned into this.
[00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.288]  Anybody, everybody who's anybody.
[00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:08.609]  You're gonna be able to see who's listening.
[00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:14.433]  And they could bring up Matt Gaetz, or Marjorie Taylor Greene, or any of the other people that are, you know, active on Spaces.
[00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:14.854]  Right.
[00:08:14.954 --> 00:08:16.235]  It's a totally unique
[00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:17.375]  We're good to go.
[00:08:33.642 --> 00:08:34.142]  Oh, that's right.
[00:08:34.182 --> 00:08:35.763]  I forgot about that.
[00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:36.524]  I almost forgot about him.
[00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:55.799]  We're good to go.
[00:09:22.932 --> 00:09:23.993]  It's the campaign doing it, not him.
[00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:24.414]  Very calculated.
[00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:25.194]  Yeah, calculated.
[00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:26.956]  Well, what do you think about him?
[00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:28.278]  I mean, did he wait too long?
[00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:30.420]  Is it, you know, about damn time?
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.264]  How would you have done it if you were Trump's campaign manager and had this?
[00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:34.825]  Because you're right.
[00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:35.846]  Once he's on, he's on.
[00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.828]  This is like a major, major event.
[00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:43.432]  How do you think, what do you think the thinking is around him doing it now?
[00:09:43.572 --> 00:09:47.294]  I always believed that he was going to come back to the platform even when he said that he wasn't.
[00:09:47.494 --> 00:09:47.694]  Right.
[00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:53.198]  And I thought, and I've said this before either on X or on air, I can't remember, but I know that I've said this before.
[00:09:53.498 --> 00:09:55.399]  I thought that it was going to be his October surprise.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.543]  And I'm glad that he's coming back when he has, but keep in mind one of the
[00:10:03.214 --> 00:10:17.062]  Interesting things that I've observed about the assassination attempt on July 13th is that it was, the zeitgeist was so much support for Donald Trump in the seven days following the assassination attempt.
[00:10:17.102 --> 00:10:20.224]  I mean, you have people like Mark Zuckerberg coming out and saying, wow, that was pretty badass.
[00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:23.166]  It was all over the press.
[00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:35.236]  That's when the Biden campaign panicked, and I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of Pelosi and others making the decision to force him out, because it tilted everything in Trump's favor so drastically.
[00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:37.814]  We are a forgetful people.
[00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:40.816]  We live in an era of 30-second TikTok posts.
[00:10:40.836 --> 00:10:44.559]  We live in an era of quick clips, quick content, fast, low attention span.
[00:10:45.339 --> 00:11:04.753]  And so many people in America, I don't want to accuse our audience of this or true patriots of this, but so many just average Americans who only pay attention kind of passively from time to time have already forgotten that zeitgeist has worn off of just how astounding and inspirational and just shocking that whole thing was.
[00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:20.397]  And so I think that it's good that Trump has saved something like this for this late in the game because it's going to have more momentum into the actual election day on November 5th than if he would have done it six months ago or nine months ago.
[00:11:20.437 --> 00:11:21.337]  That would have worn off.
[00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:23.678]  Now, I hope that he's got more things like this
[00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:31.361]  To come over the course of the next 90 days or so because there always has to be a real zinger all the way up until election day.
[00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:44.046]  You don't want people to forget some of the main awesome milestones of a campaign like the assassination, like the coming back to the X platform and getting hundreds of thousands of likes despite Krazenstein's repeated attempts to ratio him.
[00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:48.188]  Every time they can, they get like 3,000 likes on the replies to his 300,000 like post.
[00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:48.648]  Right, right.
[00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:49.228]  Not even close.
[00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:49.889]  Not even like 1%, right?
[00:11:51.229 --> 00:12:02.098]  So, I just hope that this momentum carries and I hope that somehow he's able to use this platform to re-inspire the base in the American people and remind the American people of the key points that actually distinguish him from Kamala Harris.
[00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:08.383]  Well, and that is the beautiful thing about X is once he's back, everything he tweets will be a new news story, right?
[00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:10.245]  He can set the news cycle.
[00:12:10.285 --> 00:12:12.287]  Unless the media learned from last time.
[00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:13.347]  Unless they just ignore it.
[00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:14.148]  But they can't though.
[00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.789]  That's the thing about his tweeting is
[00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.132]  It forces them to address it, especially when he is a little more offensive.
[00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:22.593]  They can't help themselves.
[00:12:22.673 --> 00:12:24.374]  It's like, you know, it's like fishing with earthworms.
[00:12:24.414 --> 00:12:25.034]  It's like cheating.
[00:12:25.074 --> 00:12:26.034]  It's like they can't help them.
[00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:27.155]  They have to go for the hook.
[00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:28.376]  They have to get caught.
[00:12:29.156 --> 00:12:32.858]  I don't think they're gonna, I don't think they're gonna, they're not gonna be able to resist.
[00:12:33.798 --> 00:12:39.541]  I will say, this is something that I would be very surprised to see somebody like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris do this space tonight.
[00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:51.901]  Well, Kamala Harris hasn't even done a normal sit-down interview with the fawning, you know, obsessed mainstream media.
[00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:57.463]  So this is way outside of their wheelhouse, but it's directly in Trump's wheelhouse, which is what I'm so excited about.
[00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:01.984]  It's like, everything with Trump's kind of a two-edged sword, right?
[00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:05.706]  It's like, you love how off-the-cuff he is, but at times you're like, stick to the script, Trump.
[00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:07.287]  Jesus, like, come on, this is important.
[00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:08.908]  You gotta stop rambling.
[00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:16.352]  But this is his wheelhouse, 100%, being off-the-cuff, being less formal, being...
[00:13:16.992 --> 00:13:17.933]  Indeterminate time.
[00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:19.454]  How long do you think this is gonna go?
[00:13:19.514 --> 00:13:21.036]  I mean, it could go four hours.
[00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:22.937]  Trump gives speeches that are two hours long.
[00:13:23.298 --> 00:13:24.579]  Who knows how long an interview could go.
[00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:26.961]  If I had to guess, I think it'll go two hours solid.
[00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:31.305]  I wonder if Mario Nafl knows something because he's launching his post.
[00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:33.306]  I don't know.
[00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:52.215]  How different he is.
[00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:58.339]  And one of the things that came to mind is you were mentioning that about this disparity between him and Kamala in terms of willingness to speak and do interviews and things of that nature.
[00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:03.923]  The more genuine you are, the easier it is to have an off-the-cuff conversation.
[00:14:03.963 --> 00:14:06.965]  I mean, even RFK Jr., for example, is not somebody that I support.
[00:14:07.745 --> 00:14:09.166]  At all, I'm very much opposed to him.
[00:14:09.686 --> 00:14:19.513]  But he's able to have a long conversation with Joe Rogan because he's well versed and has solid beliefs that are genuine behind some of his vaccine research and things of that nature.
[00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:20.293]  He's able to do that.
[00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:28.378]  But when you're a Kamala Harris type candidate and you're entirely fake and focus grouped, you're accustomed to giving the same exact speech verbatim.
[00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:30.860]  Elizabeth Warren's guilty of this too, from city to city.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.200]  During the campaign trail.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:44.727]  I mean, we've shown montages on this network of how she's literally saying the memorized speech in every single rally that she does because she's not somebody who operates from a genuine formula of a political philosophy.
[00:14:44.747 --> 00:14:53.351]  She's somebody who does the focus group thing and then just is like this empty vessel of a human being that just regurgitates what the research says is going to be most effective over and over again.
[00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:59.534]  She can't be caught off guard or by surprise because she doesn't have the authenticity to pivot or improvise in an environment.
[00:14:59.554 --> 00:15:00.615]  I think it was Mark Twain that said,
[00:15:01.155 --> 00:15:07.083]  He has some really clever quote among thousands where he said, you know, always tell the truth because it's easier to remember.
[00:15:07.103 --> 00:15:07.544]  Yeah.
[00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:12.450]  And when you're full of shit, it's really hard to improvise and be consistent.
[00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.952]  And that's why they have to stick to the script so much.
[00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:14.593]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.275]  Because when you were saying that, you know, it's a.
[00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:20.668]  It's hard to do these long form conversations if you're inauthentic.
[00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:24.170]  I was going to say, you know, also intelligence helps, but it's really not intelligence.
[00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:34.157]  I mean, you can have dumb people, but if they're authentic, I mean, if they're, if they're not trying to trick you or pull something over on you, they can be entertaining and fun to listen to and enlightening in some way.
[00:15:34.257 --> 00:15:35.257]  It's not really about intelligence.
[00:15:35.377 --> 00:15:37.239]  Is it about, it is about authenticity.
[00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:38.960]  And I think you're right in that.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:49.006]  You know, lying, deceiving, like if you're not sure about what you're saying, it can be very, very hard just to speak off the cuff, but obviously that's what Trump is supremely good at.
[00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:52.809]  I just am fascinated at this whole event.
[00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:57.532]  I mean, Elon Musk is an incredibly fascinating historical figure.
[00:15:57.632 --> 00:16:02.255]  Donald Trump is, of course, just like beyond anybody else, you know, times a thousand.
[00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.617]  These two guys getting together to have a conversation,
[00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.526]  Is it, do you think this is the best, what form do you think it's going to take?
[00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:10.327]  Is there going to be video to this?
[00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:13.589]  Is it literally just going to be Elon and Trump like on their cell phones?
[00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:16.011]  Are we going to hear Diablo 4 being played in the background?
[00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.772]  Elon Musk is just like chilling.
[00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:19.413]  There's literally a rocket launch in the background.
[00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:21.375]  Sorry, I've got to go.
[00:16:21.455 --> 00:16:22.616]  I'm a little bit busy here.
[00:16:22.636 --> 00:16:22.816]  Yeah.
[00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:25.137]  I wonder, uh, I wonder what this is going to look like.
[00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:26.838]  Cause it's, it's sort of uncharted territory.
[00:16:26.898 --> 00:16:27.999]  I think it's going to be just audio.
[00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:32.002]  I'm not sure that the video, um, the video feature is ready on space yet,
[00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:33.783]  But this would be an awesome time to launch that.
[00:16:33.843 --> 00:16:34.023]  Right.
[00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:35.023]  That could be like a surprise.
[00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:36.203]  Holy cow, this looks amazing.
[00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:37.164]  So we'll see.
[00:16:37.724 --> 00:16:40.105]  But I bet you it's going to be more like a traditional space with audio.
[00:16:40.305 --> 00:16:40.545]  Yeah.
[00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.005]  Yeah, it is.
[00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:43.006]  It is very interesting.
[00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:47.687]  Now, there was the... What do you make of this letter from Thierry Breton?
[00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:58.051]  And I don't know or care if I'm pronouncing that correctly, but he puts out this incredibly long letter to Elon Musk about two...
[00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.111]  Geographic areas, he has absolutely no authority in.
[00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:21.598]  America and the UK, which has left the European Union for all intents and purposes, even though we get into the nitty-gritty there, but he says, I'm writing to you in the context of recent events in the United Kingdom and in relation to the plan to broadcast on your platform X of a live conversation between a US presidential candidate and yourself, which will also be accessible to users in the EU.
[00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:27.183]  So to me, and this guy's the head of the European Commission, I believe, right?
[00:17:27.203 --> 00:17:30.426]  He's at least a member of it, but I think he's in charge.
[00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:35.111]  They're doing a lot of stuff to try to clamp down on social media platforms right now.
[00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:42.398]  It does have to do with what's going on in the UK, because similar movements are happening in Germany and France and elsewhere in the European Union.
[00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:50.702]  But it seems like such a stretch, like such a heavy-handed thing to do, it reeks of desperation to me.
[00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:56.185]  Like, if he could do this behind the scenes, I could understand him sending this letter and kind of quietly trying to stamp this down.
[00:17:56.585 --> 00:18:00.927]  But the fact that he—he published this letter, he put this letter out, Thierry Breton.
[00:18:01.627 --> 00:18:04.849]  He's trying to intimidate Elon Musk, and he's doing it in a public way.
[00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:10.473]  This, like, reeks of desperation, but he has to have known that this was never gonna work.
[00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:15.356]  I mean, he doesn't... I don't think in this letter he says, like, do not have this conversation.
[00:18:15.776 --> 00:18:17.398]  Clearly, that is the intent.
[00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:23.822]  Clearly, he's trying to, you know, in the most, sort of, passive-aggressive way, stop this from happening.
[00:18:32.548 --> 00:18:39.593]  His resources coupled with his disposition, he knows that this is going to be totally ineffective and actually intimidating Elon himself, right?
[00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:39.973]  Right.
[00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:50.260]  So the thinking is, alright, what do we gain as this totalitarian globalist organization by putting out a statement or a threat like this against Elon Musk?
[00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:57.265]  We know that he's not going to back off, we know he's still going to do the same thing, but I think what they were thinking was, this is going to
[00:18:58.426 --> 00:18:58.726]  I don't know.
[00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:23.574]  Elon Musk or trying to get Elon Musk to do something different.
[00:19:23.594 --> 00:19:30.122]  I think they were just using that as an excuse to send out this viral statement that would kind of shock and scare some of their own citizens.
[00:19:30.382 --> 00:19:30.923]  But I could be wrong.
[00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:38.833]  Well, I just think it could it could easily have backlash where people are going, well, wait, you know, we thought you were just trying to, you know,
[00:19:39.642 --> 00:19:44.985]  Do your job and keep things safe in the EU, but here you are trying to use this to clearly have a political influence.
[00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:54.011]  This seems like it would have a negative impact, at least for people who care at all in the European Union, if there are any left, that care about free speech and free expression.
[00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:56.193]  Well, who has the political leverage in the European Union?
[00:19:56.233 --> 00:20:05.379]  Is it the citizens who are disgruntled with this invasion that's occurred over the course of the decades, or do the refugees and asylum seekers now actually have the political leverage?
[00:20:05.959 --> 00:20:10.221]  This is also sort of catering to them and throwing them a nod because they're very pleased to see this kind of thing.
[00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:10.841]  Yeah.
[00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:12.521]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:16.443]  It's a very bureaucratic letter, I guess you could say.
[00:20:17.243 --> 00:20:17.683]  Right?
[00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:22.985]  It's all sort of double speak implications instead of saying things outright.
[00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:25.807]  And I mean, I don't even want to read it.
[00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.727]  It's all just like kind of like gobbledygook.
[00:20:27.807 --> 00:20:30.488]  Imagine threatening someone over a conversation that hasn't taken place.
[00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:30.928]  Right.
[00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:31.889]  Watch what you say.
[00:20:33.902 --> 00:21:00.417]  With the number one political candidate in the U.S., like, again, it's this bizarre, I guess it is just flexing, I guess it is just sort of shoving it in everyone's face and going, yeah, we, you know, we spun our wheels and freaked out and cried and pulled our hair out for two years about Russian influence in the election, but here the EU is just openly stating we want things censored to direct politics overseas, and nobody does anything about it.
[00:21:00.457 --> 00:21:02.338]  They all love to say that no one is above the law.
[00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:06.060]  I mean, same thing with these Trump prosecutions that have been taking place for years now.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.841]  That was the reoccurring theme.
[00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:11.383]  No one is above the law, whether it was Schumer or Kamala or Biden or Carnegie and Pierre.
[00:21:11.683 --> 00:21:12.643]  That was what they all said.
[00:21:12.683 --> 00:21:13.544]  It was a talking point.
[00:21:14.164 --> 00:21:23.809]  And whenever they say no one is above the law in terms of censorship or coming after political opponents or political dissidents, what they're actually saying is we're coming after you.
[00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.910]  Right.
[00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.891]  So they present it as going after this
[00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:31.514]  You know, key influencers like Alex Jones or like Donald Trump, like Elon Musk.
[00:21:31.774 --> 00:21:34.497]  But what they're actually saying is, you're screwed.
[00:21:34.757 --> 00:21:35.858]  That's the people, right?
[00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:38.460]  And we're going to make an example of these high-end individuals.
[00:21:39.824 --> 00:21:40.964]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:41.604 --> 00:21:45.265]  Again, I wonder what exactly is going to come of all of this.
[00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:50.826]  I would love to see Trump just full-fledged back in 2016 campaign Twitter mode.
[00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:51.246]  Yes.
[00:21:51.546 --> 00:21:52.747]  We have not seen that quite yet.
[00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:54.667]  I actually want to read this.
[00:21:54.687 --> 00:22:02.409]  It's somewhat of a longer post, but it's from 9MilligramSSG, 9MM underscore SMG on X.
[00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.834]  I think this is basically exactly what I think about Elon Musk, and I want to get your take on this.
[00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:13.558]  He says this, quote, Some of you are going to flip out and go full schizo mode after I read this post.
[00:22:13.638 --> 00:22:14.098]  I don't care.
[00:22:14.238 --> 00:22:16.040]  Elon Musk has done a lot for the right.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.122]  More than everyone reading this combined, and not by a little.
[00:22:19.483 --> 00:22:21.144]  No, it's not 100% free speech.
[00:22:21.204 --> 00:22:23.006]  No, I don't agree with his stance regarding Israel.
[00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:24.927]  But this platform changed the nation.
[00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:29.571]  You can purity spiral regarding certain things, and I definitely still see some accounts being unfairly hit.
[00:22:29.912 --> 00:22:31.193]  But do you remember before?
[00:22:31.673 --> 00:22:36.955]  Every time Elon crosses a line, they drag him through the mud and try to destroy the platform so you can't have a voice.
[00:22:37.415 --> 00:22:50.660]  I don't think you understand that you can either have a platform with massive reach that allows more than any other large app where you can actually change minds, or could have him go full-scale nuclear and be stuck on Telegram yelling to a much smaller group that already believes the same.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.121]  They will shut down X if it goes too far, and then what are you left with?
[00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:55.241]  He goes on,
[00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:21.043]  The people who sit on the app and wish for his destruction and the destruction of X are still given platforms here.
[00:23:21.143 --> 00:23:22.283]  Recognize how the world works.
[00:23:22.363 --> 00:23:28.968]  Recognize that an app this size cannot function without advertisers, and every time he's crossed a line of theirs, they've tried to destroy everything.
[00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:30.709]  Do I agree with everything he does and says?
[00:23:30.749 --> 00:23:31.270]  Of course not.
[00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.272]  Am I tremendously thankful he brought this app?
[00:23:35.032 --> 00:23:35.612]  Absolutely.
[00:23:36.112 --> 00:23:37.953]  And that's, I mean... Imagine if he hadn't.
[00:23:38.373 --> 00:23:39.313]  Imagine if he hadn't.
[00:23:40.113 --> 00:23:51.535]  I mean, even just the Palestine-Israel stuff over the last, you know, nine, ten months, I mean, there's still some amount of censorship when it comes to that topic, more than any other topic for sure.
[00:23:51.575 --> 00:23:53.396]  Censored how, like, shadow-censored?
[00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:55.236]  Yeah, yeah, like, minimization.
[00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:58.917]  No, well, and that's the thing, and that is the sneaky part about
[00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:02.259]  Twitter under Elon is like Twitter before would just ban you outright.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.202]  They did a lot of shadow banning too.
[00:24:05.562 --> 00:24:17.232]  Yeah they did but I feel like there's well maybe we just didn't know before because Twitter analytics and stuff but certainly it's still very effective to shut people down but not let them know that you're shutting them down.
[00:24:17.432 --> 00:24:19.514]  Like it's very obvious when somebody just can't log into their account.
[00:24:19.534 --> 00:24:27.140]  It's so hard to tell though because I'm not accusing the Israeli and Israel antagonists of this but I have noticed that a lot of people
[00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:28.442]  I don't know.
[00:24:45.512 --> 00:24:55.955]  I wonder if the reason that a lot of people who post Israel-related content are seeing a decline in their reach is because we're getting further and further away from October 7th, and it's just not that much of a talking point.
[00:24:55.975 --> 00:24:56.435]  Not as popular.
[00:24:56.455 --> 00:25:04.098]  Well, I know that looking at some of the Twitter analytics several months ago, I mean much, much closer to October 7th, there was a definite
[00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:04.878]  Yeah.
[00:25:04.898 --> 00:25:05.379]  Interesting.
[00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:25.856]  He's great.
[00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:35.845]  LawNativePatriot, you know, he was publishing today, he's like, I have over 100,000, I have 115,000 followers, and yet my new pinned tweet has been seen by 1,500 people.
[00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:40.288]  So, 1% of his followers are actually seeing his stuff.
[00:25:40.609 --> 00:25:51.037]  So clearly there's still these sort of, whether they're latent from old Twitter, or whether they're new forms of this soft censorship, clearly it's still the Patriots, it's the...
[00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:54.259]  Libertarians, it's the right-wingers, it's anti-government people.
[00:25:54.279 --> 00:26:01.543]  Well, even Elon Musk has admitted that they found hidden code that were removing people who had been reported a certain minimum number of times from trending.
[00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:08.467]  So Elon Musk would trend, for example, it would be removed within like an hour just because his account's so big that it's been reported so many times.
[00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:11.509]  And he found that like this hidden, secret, you know, kind of sabotage.
[00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:20.494]  It's like the scene from Dune, in the first Dune when the Harkonnen had been living in the wall for like six weeks or whatever and tried to assassinate Paul Atreides.
[00:26:21.234 --> 00:26:25.295]  It's almost like there's little code hidden in the walls.
[00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:27.556]  You have to find it, right?
[00:26:27.876 --> 00:26:28.797]  Find all the hunter-seekers.
[00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:31.637]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:26:31.657 --> 00:26:34.378]  I mean, Twitter has a deep state.
[00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:40.460]  It's like every big corporation and the government has a permanent deep state that sets these things in place.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.601]  And those people may be gone, but their code still lingers.
[00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.981]  Yeah.
[00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:45.022]  Interesting.
[00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:48.870]  Well, all I know is thank God for Elon Musk.
[00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.290]  Thank God we're back online.
[00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.072]  In fact, it was Jamie, our writer, Jamie White, on InfoWars.
[00:26:55.092 --> 00:26:55.872]  He saw the same thing I did.
[00:26:55.892 --> 00:26:56.912]  Looks like we're back.
[00:26:56.952 --> 00:26:58.673]  We're back, yeah, because I saw it today, too.
[00:26:59.113 --> 00:27:00.674]  Opened up my Twitter on the notifications.
[00:27:00.754 --> 00:27:04.395]  New notifications for Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:27:04.435 --> 00:27:05.695]  And it's like, oh, we're back.
[00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:09.156]  How much has your following grown since Elon Musk took over on X?
[00:27:09.576 --> 00:27:11.917]  Well, I didn't have an account until Elon took over.
[00:27:11.957 --> 00:27:14.258]  Right, but when you got your account back, how many followers did you have?
[00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:20.121]  Not very many because it was deleted early on, but that was another thing is I saw... You've blown up, I've noticed.
[00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:21.581]  You've got tens of thousands of followers now.
[00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:25.763]  Well, I had a really good post about CrowdStrike that like doubled my followers recently.
[00:27:26.003 --> 00:27:27.464]  I'm not quite at 100,000 yet.
[00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:29.885]  I do not put effort into it at all.
[00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:31.286]  And hey, let me just say...
[00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:35.130]  Thank God for Alex Jones and for InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.050]  Thank you, InfoWars audience, for going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:48.252]  It means that myself, Chase, we can post whatever the hell we want no matter how popular it's gonna be, no matter how anybody's gonna like it, no matter how censored it's gonna be.
[00:27:48.552 --> 00:27:53.233]  We post whatever we want because it has no impact on our income whatsoever.
[00:27:53.653 --> 00:27:54.453]  Yeah.
[00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:59.234]  I do American Journal every day and as long as I do that and, you know, don't
[00:27:59.674 --> 00:28:00.996]  Fly off the deep end or something.
[00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:02.999]  I don't even know what I would have to do to get fired.
[00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:12.932]  But as long as we have InfoWars, as long as this platform exists, our speech is completely unencumbered by any considerations other than just what we want to say.
[00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:16.276]  And that is such a freeing and liberating...
[00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:23.401]  Headspace to be in to where when I post on Twitter, it's never like calculated in any way whatsoever.
[00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:24.362]  Oh, this will get a lot of you.
[00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:26.503]  I really need to feed my family.
[00:28:26.543 --> 00:28:28.705]  I better do something that'll be a crowd pleaser here.
[00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:31.726]  Never even enters into the calculations.
[00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:36.610]  So, thank you for going to InfoWarsTore.com, keeping us on the air and completely, utterly, totally free.
[00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:37.891]  From Influence.
[00:28:37.971 --> 00:28:38.652]  Even from you!
[00:28:38.872 --> 00:28:39.613]  That's the beautiful part.
[00:28:39.633 --> 00:28:44.338]  When you go to InfoWarsTore.com, it means that we don't even have to pander to you.
[00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:45.340]  And isn't that what you want?
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.441]  You don't want people pandering to you.
[00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:49.024]  You want people telling you the truth, whether you like it or not.
[00:28:49.044 --> 00:28:52.468]  Because InfoWarriors can handle it, has been my experience.
[00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:56.332]  So yeah, it's a beautiful thing not to have to worry about that.
[00:28:56.593 --> 00:28:56.893]  But again,
[00:28:57.794 --> 00:29:00.495]  I had no followers, basically.
[00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:07.577]  I mean, I'd been through, what, 12 accounts by the time Elon gave me my original account back, and it's been amazing.
[00:29:07.637 --> 00:29:13.839]  But there was a time period where, like, when I first got my account back, it was exploding, just massive growth.
[00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:16.239]  Well, I think a lot of people...
[00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:38.171]  I think a lot of people boycotted Twitter after The Purge on January 6th and in the weeks following.
[00:29:38.711 --> 00:29:44.857]  And I think a lot of the people that boycotted Twitter came back to the platform from Getter as soon as it was under new ownership.
[00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:45.878]  Yeah, that could be it.
[00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:46.898]  Because I saw the same thing.
[00:29:46.939 --> 00:29:55.166]  I saw thousands of followers come in the first month that Must came back and I never tweeted anything that's considered really censorable.
[00:29:55.726 --> 00:29:57.307]  It was the same account you had before, Elon.
[00:29:57.687 --> 00:30:03.390]  Yes, yes, and I noticed, and I think it was just an influx of people that came back to Twitter and started following accounts again.
[00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.410]  Interesting, yeah, that could have been it.
[00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.931]  Or both, it could be both.
[00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:18.396]  Yeah, I just noticed such a severe... You just have to be careful, because if you write everything off as shadowbanning, I'm not accusing you of this, and I don't even think that it's... I think that it probably is a problem, so I'm dismissing it, but if you write everything off as shadowbanning, it...
[00:30:19.597 --> 00:30:20.177]  We're good to go.
[00:30:36.425 --> 00:30:37.726]  It's not because my ideas are bad.
[00:30:37.766 --> 00:30:39.947]  It's because I'm Shadow.
[00:30:39.967 --> 00:30:42.448]  I'm not getting laid, but it's because women are terrible.
[00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:44.489]  Okay, dude.
[00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:45.890]  It's pure seething and coping.
[00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:47.851]  There is certainly something to that.
[00:30:47.871 --> 00:30:49.652]  But clearly, Shadow Banning is real.
[00:30:50.393 --> 00:30:52.254]  We're finding more out about that.
[00:30:52.614 --> 00:30:54.695]  It's definitely better than it used to be.
[00:30:55.195 --> 00:30:57.356]  And thank God, again, for Elon Musk.
[00:30:57.617 --> 00:31:01.058]  Again, if you're just joining us, we're just hanging out doing a little pre-game show here.
[00:31:02.219 --> 00:31:09.064]  They're scheduled to go on X Spaces with Trump and Elon at 7 p.m.
[00:31:09.104 --> 00:31:09.324]  tonight.
[00:31:09.344 --> 00:31:10.605]  We will be here for that.
[00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:16.268]  Likely it'll be sort of similar to our coverage of the RNC, where we'll mostly be watching it.
[00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:21.272]  We'll chime in with entertaining and enlightening comments as we see fit.
[00:31:21.692 --> 00:31:24.654]  But mostly we'll just be watching along with all you fine folks.
[00:31:25.294 --> 00:31:27.716]  I believe Owen Schroer will be joining us at some point.
[00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:31.899]  I know he was doing a pre-recorded interview after the War Room today.
[00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:35.942]  And Alex Jones should be doing something a little later this evening as well.
[00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:40.105]  I'm not sure what we can or want to say about that, but... No, it's published.
[00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.666]  He's gonna be with Mario Nafl.
[00:31:41.846 --> 00:31:44.708]  He'll be with Mario Nafl at 9 p.m.
[00:31:44.748 --> 00:31:45.048]  tonight.
[00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:51.313]  And I think we're gonna broadcast that too, so if you stay tuned on our live streams on either Real Alex Jones or here on InfoWars, you should be able to see it.
[00:31:51.573 --> 00:32:00.540]  So stay tuned to InfoWars regardless, but also, you know, go ahead and join the Trump space just to get those, we want to pump those numbers up.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.120]  Yeah.
[00:32:01.521 --> 00:32:03.222]  And we got to have a lot of people listening in.
[00:32:03.962 --> 00:32:06.804]  Again, I wonder if, if they're going to let anybody talk.
[00:32:06.865 --> 00:32:11.668]  I wonder who's going to, that's, this is the fascinating thing about, about spaces.
[00:32:11.688 --> 00:32:13.389]  Just Joe Biden in there with his hand raised the whole time.
[00:32:13.429 --> 00:32:14.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:17.452 --> 00:32:18.632]  Exactly.
[00:32:18.692 --> 00:32:19.913]  Are you supposed to be in bed, Joe?
[00:32:19.953 --> 00:32:21.553]  He keeps requesting to speak.
[00:32:21.633 --> 00:32:25.554]  They intentionally start it right at 8 o'clock Eastern because that's when Joe goes to bed.
[00:32:26.254 --> 00:32:32.875]  Or they take him live without his permission and it's some 19-year-old girl that actually runs Joe Biden's account.
[00:32:32.895 --> 00:32:34.016]  Oh my god.
[00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:41.917]  But again, I guess anybody that wants to listen in and not be seen can use a Burner account or somebody else's account.
[00:32:41.997 --> 00:32:43.138]  You can listen anonymously.
[00:32:43.738 --> 00:32:44.278]  That's a feature.
[00:32:44.978 --> 00:32:46.058]  Oh yeah, you can, that's right.
[00:32:46.218 --> 00:32:46.658]  You can do that.
[00:32:46.959 --> 00:32:54.420]  So they would have to want to show themselves, but it'll be interesting seeing a Twitter space with like all of these politicians and celebrities and probably world leaders.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.901]  I mean, who isn't going to be looking into this?
[00:32:56.241 --> 00:33:02.542]  There's never been a, you know, television broadcast where you have a list of everybody watching at that moment.
[00:33:03.142 --> 00:33:05.243]  Which is again, I just, I love Twitter spaces.
[00:33:05.323 --> 00:33:10.324]  I love the novelty and uniqueness of this platform.
[00:33:10.964 --> 00:33:13.325]  I'm so glad this is becoming, it really is like,
[00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:15.326]  Like a global town hall.
[00:33:15.386 --> 00:33:16.207]  Everybody can listen in.
[00:33:16.267 --> 00:33:17.568]  Raise your hand if you want to speak.
[00:33:17.828 --> 00:33:19.449]  You can bring anybody up.
[00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:21.070]  It's totally fascinating.
[00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.131]  And, uh, you know, just thank God.
[00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:24.072]  Thank God for Elon Musk.
[00:33:24.092 --> 00:33:25.053]  I mean, what more can you say?
[00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:31.297]  Well, it's the only platform that I've been on where I've made true friends with strangers.
[00:33:31.457 --> 00:33:40.323]  So many of the other platforms, whether it was Facebook, Instagram, and others, historically speaking, in the social media space, have been about connecting with people that you already know.
[00:33:40.663 --> 00:33:44.525]  Right, but I mean the reason we know each other is because of Twitter, right?
[00:33:44.725 --> 00:33:54.909]  The reason I work here is because of Twitter and the reason that I get to interact with listeners as well as people that I follow and revere like the Roger Stones and others is because of this platform.
[00:33:54.929 --> 00:34:02.952]  So one of the things that I think is so powerful about it is that it actually cultivates a relationship that was formerly impossible between
[00:34:03.732 --> 00:34:04.052]  Exactly.
[00:34:04.132 --> 00:34:09.274]  So on that note, I mean, I have to assume that Donald Trump has been using a burner account this whole time.
[00:34:09.294 --> 00:34:10.674]  I have to assume that he's not-
[00:34:32.941 --> 00:34:33.141]  Who?
[00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:33.922]  You know Greg?
[00:34:34.562 --> 00:34:35.062]  You follow Greg?
[00:34:35.082 --> 00:34:35.743]  Oh, is that Trump?
[00:34:36.023 --> 00:34:36.723]  Yeah.
[00:34:36.763 --> 00:34:39.284]  That would be awesome.
[00:34:39.304 --> 00:34:39.965]  It's Barron, dude.
[00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:40.325]  Yeah.
[00:34:40.465 --> 00:34:52.071]  Yeah, I wonder what is, you know, it's funny because when Alex got his account back and I was helping him get set up on his phone with it and stuff back in December, it was on a Sunday and I was in Twitter for the first time ever holding Alex's phone, right?
[00:34:52.151 --> 00:34:52.611]  Right, right.
[00:34:52.951 --> 00:34:58.094]  And I saw what his burner account was and I'm not going to say what it is, but it was the funniest shit that I've ever seen.
[00:34:58.114 --> 00:34:58.254]  That's
[00:35:04.204 --> 00:35:10.247]  Yeah, so I wonder, because there's no way Trump just didn't get on Twitter for the last four years.
[00:35:10.307 --> 00:35:13.928]  Like, he definitely was on Twitter, but was he, though?
[00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:17.430]  And is his platform going to change from what he's seeing on Twitter?
[00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:25.293]  I mean, we know Trump responds to his audience, and whether that's... He could have been logging in on his Burner account the whole time, or on his actual account and just not interacting.
[00:35:25.573 --> 00:35:26.574]  I suppose he could have done that, yeah.
[00:35:26.594 --> 00:35:27.054]  He's had it back.
[00:35:27.614 --> 00:35:32.515]  But, I mean, he posts on Truth Social as if he's seen something on Twitter.
[00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:33.636]  Yeah, he's responding to it on Twitter.
[00:35:33.656 --> 00:35:36.056]  Right, so obviously he's monitoring Twitter and he's responding on Truth.
[00:35:36.096 --> 00:35:37.677]  And that was kind of the back and forth that was going on.
[00:35:37.697 --> 00:35:38.517]  I'm just so relieved.
[00:35:38.737 --> 00:35:52.701]  And I know that I heard, I don't know if it's true still, but I heard that Truth Social did take a hit in terms of its valuation in response to Trump coming back on X. But this guy understands, Trump understands that saving this country is more important than, you know, a stock value.
[00:35:52.721 --> 00:35:53.281]  I mean, he's one of the
[00:35:53.841 --> 00:36:06.667]  Few if any president I think there was one other example of a president that had a lower net worth when leaving office than when entering office and They can say all they want about Trump trying to be corrupt or exploit the the power for the sake of his business But the numbers just don't add up.
[00:36:06.707 --> 00:36:08.668]  I mean, this is somebody who is it's all about legacy now
[00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:09.208]  Yeah.
[00:36:09.569 --> 00:36:10.409]  Yeah, it has to be.
[00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:13.051]  I mean, it's the cliché thing, right?
[00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:15.654]  I mean, they forced him to stay around.
[00:36:16.074 --> 00:36:21.618]  They could have left him alone, and he might not have even run a third time after 2020, but they have dragged him.
[00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:25.306]  Literally.
[00:36:25.747 --> 00:36:26.869]  They tried to kill him.
[00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:28.130]  It was a fight to the death.
[00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.891]  Yeah, right.
[00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:44.212]  It's literally a fight to the death.
[00:36:44.633 --> 00:36:49.978]  But certainly, like, his entire legacy is up for grabs right now.
[00:36:50.018 --> 00:37:04.154]  And whether, you know, he goes down as the man the media has painted him to be, or whether, you know, he gets the legacy that he deserves of a man who's basically given up everything to try to save the country, he's got to be fighting for that right now.
[00:37:05.407 --> 00:37:06.728]  What do you think about his campaign?
[00:37:06.748 --> 00:37:08.108]  What do you think about the Kamala Harris campaign?
[00:37:08.128 --> 00:37:15.452]  What do you think about the fact that people are saying, like, the polls are showing that Kamala Harris is ahead in Sweden?
[00:37:15.552 --> 00:37:17.053]  Well, they said the same thing in 2006.
[00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:18.554]  They were saying the same thing about Biden.
[00:37:19.014 --> 00:37:24.677]  So keep in mind that all the polls, even the 538 projections, were saying that Biden was leading against Trump.
[00:37:25.037 --> 00:37:25.257]  Right.
[00:37:25.517 --> 00:37:28.019]  But we know that their internal- Oh, you mean like this race?
[00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:28.519]  This race.
[00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:28.839]  Okay.
[00:37:28.859 --> 00:37:29.079]  Yeah.
[00:37:29.319 --> 00:37:32.241]  Their internal numbers were showing different
[00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:33.481]  We're good to go.
[00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:54.189]  I think?
[00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:34.900]  That just goes to show that these polls cannot be trusted when they say that Kamala's ahead because the same polls were saying that Biden was ahead while the Democrats themselves were panicking internally, right?
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.180]  Right.
[00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:42.187]  But I will say that I don't think Kamala Harris is to be underestimated and I am very concerned that
[00:38:43.248 --> 00:39:00.360]  You know, awakened patriots and info warriors, you know, see the brazen disparity between competence and moral values between the two, that they're just going to take it for granted that of course Trump will win and that will induce kind of a comatose state of the base.
[00:39:01.221 --> 00:39:03.422]  I want to see us fight like we're always losing.
[00:39:03.522 --> 00:39:04.743]  Fight like the polls are true.
[00:39:04.763 --> 00:39:05.544]  Right.
[00:39:05.644 --> 00:39:06.685]  Run this race like the polls are true.
[00:39:07.165 --> 00:39:08.006]  And I think Trump
[00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:09.806]  I think Trump is going to win.
[00:39:09.846 --> 00:39:13.428]  I think that he certainly can win, but it's definitely not guaranteed.
[00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:19.630]  And even though they're using things like AI to manipulate the crowd sizes, some of those crowd sizes are true.
[00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.991]  Some of those auditoriums are pretty, pretty filled up.
[00:39:22.071 --> 00:39:27.734]  And regardless of who's going to win, they're both going to fill auditoriums because tens of millions of people are going to vote for both of these candidates.
[00:39:28.174 --> 00:39:32.375]  Most of the people that vote for Kamala are actually just voting against Trump, similar to what happened with Joe Biden.
[00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:35.937]  They were voting against Trump, not for Joe, against Trump, not for Kamala.
[00:39:36.577 --> 00:39:45.780]  So, there's gonna be a lot of people that support, and she's got the resources, and they're laundering the money through ActBlue, and they have the legacy media totally in their grip.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.922]  These are all corrupt tools that they have at their disposal, but they are still effective, even though they're disingenuous.
[00:39:52.462 --> 00:39:55.503]  So, we should definitely fight like hell, because this is gonna be a close race, man.
[00:39:56.042 --> 00:40:06.331]  And it also seems like they're just setting up the... setting up the situation so they can cheat and say that she won and say, you know, but the polls said that she was going to win, so this is what we expected.
[00:40:06.732 --> 00:40:09.834]  But if the cheating was guaranteed, they never would have had to push out Joe.
[00:40:10.757 --> 00:40:12.378]  Yeah, that could be true.
[00:40:12.418 --> 00:40:14.338]  I mean, there's also the Joe Health scare.
[00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:17.539]  I mean, Joe is literally lying on the ground somewhere.
[00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:19.200]  You know, he's on the beach.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.600]  He's like a beached whale somewhere.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.080]  Yeah.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:29.443]  Just, uh, wasting away while we are chugging headlong towards World War III in a variety of different theaters of war.
[00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:40.697]  So, very troubling stuff that we have no idea who is leading our country at a time where we are rapidly approaching all-out conflict with Iran and Russia and China as a combined bloc.
[00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:42.018]  It's very disturbing.
[00:40:42.952 --> 00:40:44.753]  I kind of want to, do you want to take calls for 20 minutes?
[00:40:44.773 --> 00:40:50.276]  We're about 19, 20 minutes away from this scheduled start of this conversation.
[00:40:50.737 --> 00:41:11.889]  I want to hear from the folks out there, and it was a little too complicated for us to do a space ourselves, so maybe we'll just open up the phone lines for calls and get your comments here in the last 20 minutes, or you can go to the post I did on X going live right now on at InfoWars for the Trump-Musk interview pregame, and I can read out comments if you want to leave your thoughts
[00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:20.972]  There, you can follow me at Harrison H. Smith, and of course you can follow Chase at RealChaseGeyser, follow at InfoWars as well, and we'll go ahead and open up the phone lines.
[00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:25.173]  Give us a call, 1-877-789-2539, 1-877-789-2539, and while we gather calls here, we'll go to another video that Trump has put on his ex.
[00:41:35.256 --> 00:41:37.156]  And that's what all these videos are, right guys?
[00:41:37.377 --> 00:41:37.737]  Yeah.
[00:41:37.777 --> 00:41:39.217]  Let's go to I Will Fight For You.
[00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:44.758]  Here's a Trump ad that he posted with his glorious return to the platform of X. Let's watch.
[00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:48.979]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:51.360]  Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.561]  What started off as unlikely, impossible, is now reality.
[00:41:58.982 --> 00:42:02.883]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
[00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:07.091]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.931]  We have a president who actually fulfilled the promises he made during the campaign.
[00:42:11.951 --> 00:42:13.571]  Securing the border to foreign policy.
[00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:15.932]  She now has a record as president that's pretty damn impressive.
[00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:18.412]  Breaking news out of Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:22.733]  The FBI has executed an unprecedented search warrant at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.
[00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:26.373]  The former president has both sides of the political aisle up in arms.
[00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:29.654]  This is a dangerous and unstable moment in American history.
[00:42:29.674 --> 00:42:33.455]  The Justice Department has just indicted former President Donald Trump.
[00:42:33.495 --> 00:42:34.755]  For seven years they hated
[00:42:35.836 --> 00:42:41.899]  This is the epitome of the abuse of the prosecutorial power to preempt political decisions.
[00:42:42.279 --> 00:42:46.282]  I never thought anything like this could happen in America.
[00:42:46.982 --> 00:42:53.626]  The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.
[00:42:53.726 --> 00:43:01.051]  The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.
[00:43:01.651 --> 00:43:06.095]  They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom.
[00:43:08.117 --> 00:43:12.661]  They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.
[00:43:15.283 --> 00:43:21.909]  They're not coming after me, they're coming after you and I just happen to be standing in their way and I will never be moving.
[00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:27.052]  On November 5th, 2024, justice will be done.
[00:43:27.252 --> 00:43:33.215]  We will take back our country and we will make America great again.
[00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:39.677]  America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger.
[00:43:40.378 --> 00:43:44.319]  Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when challenged.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.001]  These types of things, I think, give him strength.
[00:43:48.481 --> 00:43:52.063]  When I'm re-elected, I will totally obliterate the deep state.
[00:43:55.828 --> 00:44:08.297]  As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.
[00:44:12.329 --> 00:44:17.135]  All right, folks, just one of the videos Trump has been posting to his X account as part of his glorious return.
[00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:19.638]  He'll be doing the conversation with Elon Musk tonight.
[00:44:20.039 --> 00:44:24.425]  In about 15 minutes, we're going to take a few of your phone calls as they come in.
[00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:27.849]  Still already getting some comments on the post on X.
[00:44:28.968 --> 00:44:31.049]  Most people talking about Israel, not a big surprise.
[00:44:31.089 --> 00:44:33.950]  How deep is Israel involved in our election slash deep state do you think?
[00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.970]  What is the significance?
[00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:43.552]  Q quite underscore anonymous says, Q is commenting on my post, says nothing will convince me to vote for Trump unless he denounces his loyalty to Israel.
[00:44:43.612 --> 00:44:45.533]  I'm writing in Thomas Massey in protest.
[00:44:46.013 --> 00:44:48.134]  I want a president without an AIPAC person.
[00:44:48.914 --> 00:44:50.875]  Yeah, a lot of people bringing that up.
[00:44:51.476 --> 00:44:58.821]  Crypto Plissken says, I'm worried the Dems will cheat for Trump during the election instead of themselves, then investigate and set up Trump as the cheater.
[00:44:58.941 --> 00:45:00.182]  I've not heard that theory before.
[00:45:00.422 --> 00:45:01.523]  That's a wild one, but I like it.
[00:45:01.763 --> 00:45:01.964]  Right?
[00:45:02.004 --> 00:45:10.410]  This is why they cannot allow Biden to leave office now, because that would make Mike Johnson the vice president, which would cause a problem for the Dems when they stuff the ballot for Trump.
[00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:11.250]  Interesting.
[00:45:11.891 --> 00:45:13.052]  I'd not heard about that.
[00:45:13.852 --> 00:45:17.838]  He just by default becomes the Vice President or does Kamala get to pick another one?
[00:45:29.631 --> 00:45:31.652]  In line for the presidency.
[00:45:31.672 --> 00:45:32.172]  Right.
[00:45:32.432 --> 00:45:33.433]  If they both got bombed.
[00:45:33.733 --> 00:45:33.953]  Yeah.
[00:45:34.053 --> 00:45:34.753]  If they got bombed or something.
[00:45:34.773 --> 00:45:35.634]  That's a good question.
[00:45:35.754 --> 00:45:36.014]  Yeah.
[00:45:36.354 --> 00:45:40.796]  That's maybe if they die at the same time, would he automatically move up to, or down?
[00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:43.297]  I mean, that would be a downward movement of anything.
[00:45:43.317 --> 00:45:48.400]  You know, God forbid if something happened at the same time, which I don't hope for whatsoever, despite the fact that I hate both of them.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.881]  I don't know.
[00:45:49.901 --> 00:45:50.181]  I'm not sure.
[00:45:50.201 --> 00:45:50.582]  That is a no.
[00:45:50.602 --> 00:45:51.042]  Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:45:51.082 --> 00:45:52.243]  And of course, all this stuff is...
[00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:11.552]  It has been the same since the founding, right?
[00:46:11.572 --> 00:46:14.873]  It used to be that the loser of the presidential election would become vice president.
[00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:23.095]  So, you know, if we were still in the old form of things, then when Biden gets elected, Trump would be vice president.
[00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:28.617]  So Chachibit says, if the president of the United States dies, the vice president automatically becomes the president.
[00:46:28.637 --> 00:46:30.658]  Of course, this process is outlined in the Constitution.
[00:46:31.058 --> 00:46:31.278]  Interesting.
[00:46:31.298 --> 00:46:31.638]  Thank you, Robot.
[00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:32.239]  That is interesting.
[00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:57.785]  Very interesting.
[00:46:57.846 --> 00:46:59.527]  Okay, let's go out to your calls.
[00:46:59.547 --> 00:47:03.029]  We've got Tom in Fort Myers, Florida.
[00:47:03.049 --> 00:47:04.550]  He wants to talk about election integrity.
[00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.391]  Tom, thanks for calling in.
[00:47:05.411 --> 00:47:05.911]  You're on the air.
[00:47:06.932 --> 00:47:07.933]  Thank you very much, gentlemen.
[00:47:08.133 --> 00:47:18.140]  I just have a question because I've been receiving a tremendous amount of emails from this gentleman by the name of Jay Valentine, and he's the president of Omega for America.
[00:47:19.061 --> 00:47:26.726]  And basically what he's saying is how they're going to steal this election is they're sending tremendous amounts of false ballots
[00:47:27.287 --> 00:47:35.950]  To warehouses, 7-Eleven, empty lots, and they have these people go and pick them up and basically vote these ballots.
[00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:55.957]  His argument is that no matter how much we go out and we ballot harvest ourselves for real people, they have over 25 million people in the stockpile that they can just keep adding to the vote count so that they can basically win the swing states with just about enough of what they need.
[00:47:57.623 --> 00:48:15.271]  I don't know, and my question is to you guys, because I don't know if he has viable software, supposedly, to stop this, to basically go into the tax records and find out exactly where ballots are being mailed to that are not
[00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:29.872]  There's nobody who lives there, and they could stop this, but I don't know if anybody in the media like yourselves have ever checked into this company called Omega for America.
[00:48:30.232 --> 00:48:38.576]  I personally can't do anything with it, for the simple reason you need a group of people that are using it.
[00:48:38.596 --> 00:48:44.900]  He basically says he works with state legislators, so that could be the issue right there, because
[00:48:46.036 --> 00:48:46.296]  Really?
[00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:01.036]  Well, yeah, I'll take a look at that.
[00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:02.317]  I had not heard of that.
[00:49:02.417 --> 00:49:03.538]  Omega for America.
[00:49:03.698 --> 00:49:04.499]  I'll look into that.
[00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:22.754]  I mean, the problem with ballot harvesting from the Republican side is, you know, the Democrats can do it because they have these ethnic or demographic blocks that they can more or less identify entire neighborhoods and say, okay, this neighborhood votes 99% for Joe Biden and it's all apartment buildings.
[00:49:22.774 --> 00:49:25.175]  So they can, you know, they can go to one small area
[00:49:26.076 --> 00:49:37.405]  And be assured of a certain number of votes, and you'll have like maybe, you know, one to ten percent not your guy, but everybody else will be Democrat, especially if you, you know, talk them into it while you're harvesting the vote.
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:40.808]  But Republicans don't really have neighborhoods like that.
[00:49:41.348 --> 00:49:49.975]  There are large swaths of rural areas, but it's a hell of a lot harder to get a hundred votes from a hundred farms than it is a hundred votes in a single apartment building.
[00:49:50.015 --> 00:49:53.438]  So the Democrats and their demographics are
[00:49:53.558 --> 00:49:56.939]  We're set up for ballot harvesting in a way that Republicans just aren't.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:14.447]  And then the way that, I mean, the big problem with the mail-in balloting and the process that was instituted with emergency measures without any, you know, legitimacy in the constitutional process of changing the election methods that happened during COVID, it makes it impossible to determine whether a vote is valid or not.
[00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:19.529]  And they have all sorts of, you know, shenanigans they pull in the background to make sure there's no way to
[00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:22.470]  Certify whether or not a vote is safe or not.
[00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.450]  So they say, better safe than sorry, we'll count the vote.
[00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:25.590]  It should be the opposite.
[00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:36.413]  Basically, if you don't have a chain of custody of where this vote was sent, who filled it out, and where and how they returned it, it should not be counted just on the basis of better safe than sorry.
[00:50:36.753 --> 00:50:39.334]  We can't allow fake ballots, but they're going the opposite way.
[00:50:39.394 --> 00:50:44.015]  So, yeah, the stealing the election is still a very, very, very real threat.
[00:50:44.315 --> 00:50:47.576]  And if they do it, they could do it in a very obvious and blatant way.
[00:50:48.476 --> 00:50:53.581]  And they have the media turning a blind eye and the American people terrified of speaking out against it.
[00:50:53.641 --> 00:50:59.846]  So that's a very disturbing but real possibility come this November of them just stealing it outright.
[00:50:59.886 --> 00:51:00.607]  Thank you for the call, Tom.
[00:51:00.647 --> 00:51:01.968]  Let's go to Chris in Colorado now.
[00:51:02.428 --> 00:51:04.470]  You say you're blackpilled on Kamala.
[00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:05.811]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:51:05.851 --> 00:51:10.095]  You think it's Kamala as a certainty and that's blackpilling you or what?
[00:51:11.096 --> 00:51:15.540]  You know, I really hope not because I'd hate to see Kamala in there.
[00:51:16.112 --> 00:51:17.593]  But I think we got it.
[00:51:17.753 --> 00:51:33.360]  We can't underestimate the people that pulled off the JFK assassination, the 9-11, you know, that taking down those buildings, COVID, and then, you know, the 2020 election being rigged and stolen.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:44.405]  That's kind of my point is that I think Trump or an RFK and all the other people could have all this support and huge crowds and all of it.
[00:51:45.751 --> 00:51:49.657]  Will they, you know, will they be able to overcome the cheating?
[00:51:50.037 --> 00:51:50.258]  You know?
[00:51:51.892 --> 00:51:52.412]  I don't know.
[00:51:52.612 --> 00:51:53.593]  I don't know if they will.
[00:51:53.653 --> 00:51:59.917]  And yeah, you know, what you talk about is never underestimate the delusional stupidity of the Democratic voters.
[00:51:59.937 --> 00:52:03.699]  I mean, I talked about it for like the whole show this morning on American Journal.
[00:52:03.759 --> 00:52:09.582]  You had people who are sitting there going, I've got a lot of facial piercings and multicolored hair.
[00:52:09.782 --> 00:52:12.724]  And if Trump gets elected, I won't be able to be like this anymore.
[00:52:12.744 --> 00:52:13.925]  And it's like, what are you talking like?
[00:52:13.965 --> 00:52:15.806]  They are literally delusional.
[00:52:15.846 --> 00:52:17.267]  They think that Trump is going to
[00:52:18.127 --> 00:52:19.948]  Make it illegal for them to dye their hair?
[00:52:20.168 --> 00:52:21.709]  What are they even talking about?
[00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:37.757]  So not only are their concerns completely imaginary, and they're activated against Bigfoot, they're activated against a boogeyman that doesn't exist, but they're completely ignorant to the actual gigantic global conflicts that the presidency depends on.
[00:52:38.317 --> 00:52:39.238]  They just have no idea.
[00:52:39.318 --> 00:52:44.881]  So I don't underestimate these people at all, and I think the number of people that are going to vote for anybody but Trump
[00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:49.002]  And, like, maybe they weren't very happy about doing it with Biden, but they would have.
[00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:53.783]  And with Kamala, it gives them, you know, it makes them feel good to vote for Kamala.
[00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.943]  And that's as deep as their calculus goes.
[00:52:56.003 --> 00:52:58.164]  So, I think you're exactly right.
[00:52:58.204 --> 00:53:07.706]  We should not be underestimating Kamala and her appeal to, no offense, ignorant and stupid people, or their ability to cheat.
[00:53:07.846 --> 00:53:08.866]  So, yeah, all these things.
[00:53:08.946 --> 00:53:10.267]  Very, very concerning.
[00:53:10.647 --> 00:53:11.307]  But at the same time,
[00:53:13.157 --> 00:53:15.418]  There's a certain threshold that they cannot cheat to win.
[00:53:15.438 --> 00:53:21.259]  There's a certain level that we can get to that we saw in 2016.
[00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:23.760]  Like, they don't control everything.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:30.162]  They don't have master control of every process in America.
[00:53:30.502 --> 00:53:31.362]  We can defeat them.
[00:53:31.402 --> 00:53:32.402]  We can overcome them.
[00:53:32.823 --> 00:53:34.763]  We cannot get complacent in this.
[00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:37.004]  And that's, you know, what you have to avoid.
[00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:38.124]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[00:53:38.144 --> 00:53:39.304]  Let's go to Jim in Florida.
[00:53:40.285 --> 00:53:40.725]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:53:40.745 --> 00:53:41.165]  You're on the air.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:47.443]  Hey Harrison, thank you for taking my call and I just want to give a big shout out to both you and Chase.
[00:53:47.463 --> 00:53:51.085]  This is my first opportunity to have spoken to you.
[00:53:51.905 --> 00:53:52.605]  Two points.
[00:53:53.526 --> 00:54:08.074]  Number one, I don't know if y'all remember Biden back around June or so at a rally, probably his last one, saying that when the crowd started chanting, lock him up,
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:17.784]  And he's like, oh no, you're not going to have to worry about that, because I think the sentencing was supposed to be around the day he was shot.
[00:54:18.044 --> 00:54:19.885]  So, you know, okay, right?
[00:54:19.945 --> 00:54:20.745]  Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:54:20.825 --> 00:54:24.407]  It was supposed to be like July 9th that he was sentenced, but then he got pushed back.
[00:54:25.347 --> 00:54:25.968]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:26.308 --> 00:54:35.412]  But secondly, if I may respectfully, I was alive in October of 1973 and still a political nine-year-old.
[00:54:36.421 --> 00:54:43.364]  And Spiro Agnew retired or resigned as the Vice President of the United States.
[00:54:44.665 --> 00:54:53.529]  And Nixon was able to appoint Warren Commissioner member Gerald Ford as President, and the Senate had to confirm it.
[00:54:54.266 --> 00:54:59.850]  So no, Mike Rogers would not automatically become vice president.
[00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.132]  Mike Johnson, yeah.
[00:55:02.292 --> 00:55:08.917]  And it's different from somebody dying or maybe being 25th amendmented out and resigning.
[00:55:08.957 --> 00:55:14.521]  I imagine resignation would give the president more control over who came after him.
[00:55:15.221 --> 00:55:17.243]  But very, very interesting stuff.
[00:55:17.283 --> 00:55:18.423]  And yeah, you know, the Biden
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:25.922]  There was another clip recently from a Kamala rally where they were chanting, lock him up.
[00:55:26.042 --> 00:55:28.763]  And she's like, don't worry, the courts are already doing that.
[00:55:28.964 --> 00:55:35.526]  And people are actually posting that on X. Leftists were posting that on X being like, see, this is how, you know, somebody gracefully responds to this.
[00:55:35.566 --> 00:55:39.227]  She doesn't say, you know, she doesn't encourage the chant of lock him up.
[00:55:39.427 --> 00:55:40.968]  She says, let the courts handle it.
[00:55:40.988 --> 00:55:44.549]  And it's like, okay, but they're actually are locking up their political opponent.
[00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:45.890]  Like they try to take the high ground.
[00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:53.995]  On stuff that they are actually doing, but they're constantly afraid of Trump potentially maybe doing once he's in office.
[00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:55.636]  It's all very absurd.
[00:55:55.856 --> 00:55:57.177]  It's all very silly and absurd.
[00:55:57.777 --> 00:55:59.678]  And apparently that sentencing is going to go forward.
[00:56:00.639 --> 00:56:06.343]  I know a lot of people thought it'd be delayed until after the election, but I think it's sometime in September that he'll be sentenced.
[00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.464]  Hey guys, I just wanted to say you're awesome.
[00:56:08.484 --> 00:56:10.364]  Great new additions to the crew, both you and Chase.
[00:56:10.384 --> 00:56:12.365]  It's great talking to you the first time.
[00:56:36.764 --> 00:56:56.074]  Um, I just wanted to say how grateful I am that we have X, we have Alex Jones, InfoWars, still in the fight, still doing damage, and we're at this historical moment where Elon Musk, like a pirate, takes over, you know,
[00:56:57.358 --> 00:57:02.922]  Grand Cutlass, and turns it against the Empire, and he's like, come aboard, Alex!
[00:57:03.002 --> 00:57:03.503]  Yarr!
[00:57:03.523 --> 00:57:06.665]  Yeah, he has commandeered the flagship, exactly.
[00:57:06.685 --> 00:57:13.750]  There's no, they're panicking because they have no control over it, and I just want to give a few white pills.
[00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:22.577]  I know a lot of people are discouraged, and what we're up against, and we don't want to get our hopes up because we were, we just felt so confident that he was going to win in 2020, but
[00:57:24.756 --> 00:57:25.436]  It's different.
[00:57:25.796 --> 00:57:27.777]  Think of the miracles that we've seen.
[00:57:28.617 --> 00:57:29.817]  Trump dodging a bullet.
[00:57:30.057 --> 00:57:32.217]  Alex Jones still on the air.
[00:57:33.057 --> 00:57:43.899]  Elon with X. I mean, these are major shifts in our favor, so we can't rule out the power of God and the Holy Spirit and the quickening that we're in.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.800]  Everyone feels it.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.661]  The energy is cranking up, and just as the enemy is panicking and throwing everything he's got at us,
[00:57:53.211 --> 00:57:57.873]  God is enforcing his army and you can feel it in your heart.
[00:57:58.293 --> 00:58:03.375]  So just let that love out.
[00:58:03.435 --> 00:58:11.458]  Champion the truth and build the victories that we've had and do not be discouraged because it's all about demoralization.
[00:58:11.939 --> 00:58:14.580]  And when we fight each other, the enemy wins.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.760]  Keep your eye on the goal.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.961]  The goal is election day.
[00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:20.482]  Trump wins.
[00:58:20.902 --> 00:58:22.863]  We're going to sip champagne again, brothers.
[00:58:26.164 --> 00:58:27.045]  No, you're exactly right.
[00:58:27.065 --> 00:58:38.833]  We witnessed an absolute, literal miracle with the assassination attempt of Donald Trump, and yet, people, it's like, the news cycle is so fast, it's like, really, we're gonna forget a miracle less than a month out?
[00:58:39.593 --> 00:58:40.053]  Crazy!
[00:58:40.154 --> 00:58:43.636]  We're, you know, tomorrow is the one-month anniversary of Fight!
[00:58:43.696 --> 00:58:43.916]  Fight!
[00:58:43.996 --> 00:58:44.256]  Fight!
[00:58:44.276 --> 00:58:46.938]  Of Trump almost getting his head blown off on live television.
[00:58:46.998 --> 00:58:51.922]  We cannot forget the miraculous event that we saw that day, and, uh,
[00:58:52.847 --> 00:58:57.749]  Just pray to God that his hand continues to protect America as we move forward.
[00:58:58.069 --> 00:59:04.272]  Now, Chase has gotten up and left because he's setting up the space, I believe, that we'll be talking on.
[00:59:05.712 --> 00:59:07.933]  Owen Schroyer is going to join me momentarily.
[00:59:08.393 --> 00:59:10.554]  We should be beginning in 30 seconds, but who knows?
[00:59:10.614 --> 00:59:14.196]  I mean, I guess that is the double-edged sword with Twitter Spaces.
[00:59:15.356 --> 00:59:18.138]  It's not broadcast TV, so that's good.
[00:59:18.198 --> 00:59:21.459]  But it also means we're not sure whether they're going to start directly on time.
[00:59:22.019 --> 00:59:29.163]  And I assume the crew is working feverishly to make sure that we get the... All right, folks.
[00:59:29.563 --> 00:59:30.864]  This is a new twist.
[00:59:31.304 --> 00:59:32.245]  We're going to go to a quick video.
[00:59:32.265 --> 00:59:34.506]  This is one that Trump posted on his ex.
[00:59:34.686 --> 00:59:36.047]  It's called Test of a Man.
[00:59:36.487 --> 00:59:37.307]  Here's Trump on ex.
[00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:43.911]  And when we return, Alex Jones is in studio to take over for this very special emergency broadcast.
[00:59:43.931 --> 00:59:44.311]  Stay with us.
[00:59:45.953 --> 00:59:51.576]  The test of a man is how much he will bear for a cause which he knows to be right.
[00:59:52.437 --> 00:59:55.258]  How long will he stand in the depths of despair?
[00:59:55.619 --> 00:59:58.020]  How much will he suffer and fight?
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.943]  There are many to serve when the victory is near, and few are the hurts to be borne.
[01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:10.127]  But it calls for a leader of courage to cheer the men in a battle forlorn.
[01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:17.241]  It is the way you hold out against odds that are great, that proves what your courage is worth.
[01:00:17.722 --> 01:00:23.246]  It is the way that you stand to the bruises of fate, that shows up your stature and girth.
[01:00:24.267 --> 01:00:29.611]  And victory is nothing but proof of your skill, veneered with a glory that's thin.
[01:00:30.612 --> 01:00:36.456]  Unless it is a proof of unfaltering will, and unless you have suffered to win.
[01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:42.874]  Remember that nothing worth doing is ever easy.
[01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:44.515]  You'll have bad moments.
[01:00:45.156 --> 01:00:46.537]  You gotta love what you're doing.
[01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:48.378]  And if you don't, just do something else.
[01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:52.141]  Keep standing up always for your values.
[01:00:53.582 --> 01:00:54.803]  Keep loving your country.
[01:00:56.104 --> 01:01:01.368]  And, one of the most important things, never, ever, quit.
[01:01:02.228 --> 01:01:02.929]  Never quit.
[01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:09.654]  Then ask yourself, what imprint will you leave
[01:01:10.669 --> 01:01:11.929]  In the sands of history.
[01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:22.033]  What will future Americans say we did in our brief time right here on Earth?
[01:01:23.353 --> 01:01:24.494]  Did we take risks?
[01:01:25.534 --> 01:01:29.175]  Did we dare to defy expectations?
[01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:37.438]  Did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems?
[01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:45.404]  In my short time in Washington, I've seen firsthand how the system is broken.
[01:01:46.104 --> 01:01:58.309]  A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything, and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live, and what to do, and how to think.
[01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:06.693]  But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right.
[01:02:08.067 --> 01:02:13.689]  I know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth.
[01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.831]  You'll be a warrior for our country and for your family.
[01:02:19.332 --> 01:02:23.834]  I know that each of you will do what is right, not what is the easy way.
[01:02:25.394 --> 01:02:30.957]  And that you will be true to yourself and your country and your beliefs.
[01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:33.615]  Remember this.
[01:02:34.336 --> 01:02:40.958]  Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy.
[01:02:41.238 --> 01:02:56.883]  Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it.
[01:02:57.364 --> 01:03:00.705]  It's called the road less traveled.
[01:03:09.855 --> 01:03:10.595]  All right, folks.
[01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:16.677]  It wasn't hard to predict the X-Spaces because of—I mean, I was on the Elon a while back ago.
[01:03:16.697 --> 01:03:18.618]  25 million people watched it live.
[01:03:18.638 --> 01:03:20.938]  Another 25 million, 30 million in the next couple days.
[01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:21.959]  50 million.
[01:03:22.579 --> 01:03:24.240]  I bet there's 100 million trying to tune in.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.961]  But when Biden or Kamala Harris has one of their events on YouTube, it's got 500 consecutive viewers.
[01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:31.162]  Literally, maybe 600.
[01:03:32.697 --> 01:03:33.137]  On a good day.
[01:03:33.557 --> 01:03:34.038]  On a good day.
[01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:36.179]  So this is a good problem to have, like Rumble.
[01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:40.700]  I've been on some shows, like Steven Crowder, when he gets two, three million and it crashes.
[01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:44.622]  And I guarantee you, election night, we're not going to crash.
[01:03:44.642 --> 01:03:46.783]  We pay for the bandwidth, but it's going to cost a lot of money.
[01:03:47.183 --> 01:03:49.864]  It costs a lot of money to bring in this information.
[01:03:49.884 --> 01:03:52.966]  Something I'm not good at is plugging to support InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:03:53.426 --> 01:03:56.387]  So Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer, Chase Geyser, the crew.
[01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:57.548]  We have a crew.
[01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:04.170]  That could run maybe eight hours of regular shows, but when they run 10, they're really running like 12 because they have to be here hours before.
[01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:07.811]  This crew has already worked 12, 14 hours or longer.
[01:04:08.131 --> 01:04:09.712]  Some of the morning crew was here at 6 a.m.
[01:04:09.752 --> 01:04:12.153]  We want to salute Matt and the rest of the crew in there.
[01:04:12.173 --> 01:04:13.793]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:04:14.593 --> 01:04:19.295]  We're trying to honor Trump, and you made a great point right before I came in, before we aired those new Trump ads.
[01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:28.009]  People are so into this news cycle and you see so many Netflix shows and horror movies and Avengers and all this stuff.
[01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:29.290]  That's entertainment.
[01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:29.750]  This is real.
[01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:31.091]  They tried to kill him a month ago.
[01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:31.572]  Right.
[01:04:32.052 --> 01:04:34.915]  And now they're admitting they're planning a civil war if he wins.
[01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:36.576]  This is a big deal.
[01:04:36.596 --> 01:04:38.658]  30 days or a month tomorrow.
[01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:39.799]  So it's a big deal.
[01:04:40.419 --> 01:05:01.346]  Yeah, it's huge, and again, it's sort of our fault, but any time I see a post that's like, remember what happened, guys, and it's a picture of him with his hand up and the blood on his face, I have to retweet it, because it's like, you have to keep this in people's minds, that they witnessed a miracle, and that what we're experiencing here is very special and can't just be taken for granted and forgotten about as much as they would like us to forget about what happened.
[01:05:01.686 --> 01:05:06.788]  And by the way, I remember in 2016, Hillary had a town hall, and it was shot at the equivalent
[01:05:08.228 --> 01:05:15.853]  Film you can see dust floating in the air and you could tell it was fake and I said that's fake and two months later they admitted the thing was shot on a soundstage was fake.
[01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:31.503]  You know fake what happened in Butler with the complete stand down for 90 minutes and the police saying he's up on the roof was a total stand down by the secret service deputy head now the head Ronald Rowe and these idiot leftists put up images of full cartridges
[01:05:32.824 --> 01:05:40.547]  And they usually put up 556, they'll put up like 308 or 338 Lapua or something or 30-06 and say, oh, this whole thing hit his ear.
[01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:41.807]  No, the bullet fires.
[01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:48.849]  And I can tell you how many times I've shot at a wild hog 600 yards away or many things I've shot, whitetail, you name it.
[01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:50.150]  I've done a lot of hunting back when I had time.
[01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.991]  Mule deer, mountain goats, you name it.
[01:05:54.171 --> 01:05:59.978]  And you'll shoot and think you missed it, and you get another one in the chamber and fire and hit it right in the chest, it falls over dead.
[01:06:00.258 --> 01:06:11.671]  When you get there, you just see a graze right through an ear, a little bit of blood, a tiny little scrape, or right about the top of the back, or right across the leg, because you're shooting 700 yards away, 500 yards away.
[01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:17.955]  I mean, so they think like a full cartridge shot out and would, no, it just skimmed him.
[01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:29.663]  It just went right by at 3,000 or 2,500 feet per minute, not 3,000 on the muzzle, but at 150 yards, about 2,400 feet per second, and just skimmed his ear.
[01:06:30.063 --> 01:06:40.230]  And so we haven't had time yet, but I want to go out the next few weeks with you guys, one of these outdoor shooting ranges, and put up maybe watermelons, you name it, and we'll just set the scopes up and shoot and graze it and show people what we're talking about.
[01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:41.951]  They'll get grazing.
[01:06:42.311 --> 01:06:47.455]  Part of the miraculous thing of the assassination attempt is the way it happened.
[01:06:47.475 --> 01:06:48.916]  It could not have been faked.
[01:06:48.936 --> 01:06:51.699]  I mean, there's a photo of the bullet flying through the air.
[01:06:51.939 --> 01:06:57.603]  Not even an AI robot could follow his head perfectly with the wind and things and only skim him.
[01:06:58.464 --> 01:06:59.404]  That guy died.
[01:06:59.464 --> 01:07:00.305]  I mean, this was real.
[01:07:00.325 --> 01:07:01.506]  I mean, you can't fake this.
[01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:03.568]  Look, you know fake when you see it.
[01:07:03.608 --> 01:07:04.148]  This was real.
[01:07:04.748 --> 01:07:04.148]  100%.
[01:07:04.768 --> 01:07:07.531]  Well, I think the important thing now is
[01:07:08.666 --> 01:07:11.247]  It's not just for us in the news cycle to keep it relevant.
[01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:20.912]  Now, these committees inside of the House that are chaired by Republicans, they need to be calling follow-up hearings immediately because we have the questions that need to be answered.
[01:07:20.932 --> 01:07:25.775]  There's really two questions at this point that need to be answered, and that's who stood down on the roof?
[01:07:26.315 --> 01:07:27.716]  Who stood down?
[01:07:28.636 --> 01:07:29.017]  We're good to go.
[01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:54.483]  The FBI Deputy Director, I'd call up Kim Cheadle back up, I'd call up Ron Rowe, they need to all be there, and these questions need to be asked and answered.
[01:07:54.703 --> 01:08:03.168]  And if they're not going to answer them, then subpoena them for all their records, and if they don't comply with the subpoena, then send their ass to jail for contempt of Congress.
[01:08:03.348 --> 01:08:04.449]  This is the only way forward.
[01:08:04.469 --> 01:08:08.572]  No, no, I totally agree, but we have them now, the new video that was released last Friday.
[01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.794]  Which is what they first reported, and the Secret Service lied and said, oh, the local police didn't do that.
[01:08:13.114 --> 01:08:17.456]  So they released the body cam, where they boost up the roof and distract him right before he shoots.
[01:08:18.117 --> 01:08:22.679]  And they're trying to get orders because they're under the Secret Service command to shoot, and they're not given the orders to do it.
[01:08:23.239 --> 01:08:24.180]  And again, I'm going to say this again.
[01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:26.404]  I used to be a huge hunter.
[01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:28.926]  Regular hunters, of course, they understand this.
[01:08:29.507 --> 01:08:32.429]  But I remember the last time I grazed something was about six years ago.
[01:08:32.449 --> 01:08:34.451]  I'm on a West Texas ranch.
[01:08:35.132 --> 01:08:36.713]  We're sitting there doing target practice.
[01:08:36.733 --> 01:08:39.856]  They go, hey, they had a lasers range front.
[01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:44.100]  They go, hey, there's a jackrabbit right on the bottom of that hill, 820 yards away.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:44.800]  Think you can hit it?
[01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:50.326]  So I'm sitting there with a .300 Win Mag, which is like a laser beam for those who don't know.
[01:08:50.907 --> 01:08:53.749]  But it still drops, you know, at that far, 3 or 4 inches.
[01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:58.995]  So I shoot with a .300 Win Mag, and I don't really want to kill a jackrabbit, I think I would hit it.
[01:08:59.695 --> 01:09:01.677]  And he runs, and I go, that son of a bitch!
[01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:05.161]  And I reload, and I shoot and hit him right in the back and blow him in half.
[01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.823]  When we got there, like I said, hit him right in the back.
[01:09:08.464 --> 01:09:12.486]  That's what killed him, but right literally over the back of his neck was the graze.
[01:09:12.766 --> 01:09:18.050]  And you could just see, and the military guy I was with, he goes, uh, he goes, you see that?
[01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:18.930]  You grazed him right there.
[01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:20.751]  And it was literally a little couple drops of blood.
[01:09:21.151 --> 01:09:23.553]  But again, the left doesn't know this about bullets.
[01:09:23.613 --> 01:09:24.373]  It's so frustrating.
[01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.554]  They don't even know what a casing is.
[01:09:25.574 --> 01:09:26.694]  They don't know what a brass is.
[01:09:26.714 --> 01:09:29.816]  I mean, you can't even have a serious conversation with a leftist these days.
[01:09:29.836 --> 01:09:31.517]  They think they're such a thing as a trans person.
[01:09:31.557 --> 01:09:32.378]  They don't know what a woman is.
[01:09:32.438 --> 01:09:34.459]  So, I mean, you know, what do you expect?
[01:09:35.959 --> 01:09:36.159]  I know.
[01:09:36.179 --> 01:09:37.240]  I mean, I keep harping on it.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.762]  They literally think a bullet is the casing and the entire round.
[01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:44.463]  Not just the round, the round, the casing, everything.
[01:09:44.483 --> 01:09:46.804]  And they literally think that fires out of the gun.
[01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:51.947]  They think, you know, Tim Walz, their vice president pick, thinks boys need to use tampons.
[01:09:52.107 --> 01:09:57.170]  I'd like somebody to ask Tim where the tampon goes on the boy or man.
[01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.291]  I'd like somebody to ask him that.
[01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:01.212]  It was never taught to me.
[01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:03.347]  Well, that's a whole other subject.
[01:10:03.848 --> 01:10:08.635]  I thought I knew everything about Tim Walz, but I saw a clip two days ago I put on Axe that I sent to the crew I went to play.
[01:10:08.655 --> 01:10:09.917]  It's like three and a half minutes of Trump.
[01:10:11.159 --> 01:10:15.906]  And you guys can find out something like this is a very important statement by Trump about Walz.
[01:10:16.929 --> 01:10:24.436]  And I didn't know that he passed laws to let pedophiles basically rape kids and let pedophiles out of jail.
[01:10:24.756 --> 01:10:30.421]  I mean this guy is like so bad and now there's like dozens of videos of him saying he was in combat.
[01:10:31.201 --> 01:10:34.324]  We had the videos a week ago where he was implying it now he's actually said it.
[01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:39.268]  Oh and there's about a dozen print articles where he's saying it as well talking about
[01:10:40.146 --> 01:10:42.628]  Operation Iraqi Freedom and all this other stuff.
[01:10:42.648 --> 01:10:44.409]  So yeah, it's bad.
[01:10:44.529 --> 01:10:45.890]  And the stolen valor is one thing.
[01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.773]  I think that's really, well, I know that's really meaningful to the veteran community, the military community.
[01:10:51.374 --> 01:10:54.636]  And so that'll, that's, I think that's where you aim that.
[01:10:55.196 --> 01:11:02.041]  But when it comes to his protection of pedophiles and with his sexual orientation bills, you know, parents need to know that.
[01:11:02.081 --> 01:11:04.403]  But I mean, look, you take one look at this guy's joker.
[01:11:04.663 --> 01:11:07.585]  I mean, he looks like Jack Nicholson is the joker.
[01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:08.686]  He gives me the creepy crawlies.
[01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:09.166]  Totally.
[01:11:09.426 --> 01:11:09.786]  Totally.
[01:11:09.886 --> 01:11:15.311]  I mean, this guy just puts off the aura of, would you let Tim Walz babysit your children?
[01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:16.352]  Oh, he puts pedo vibes.
[01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.854]  And it's weird that he's 20 years younger than Trump.
[01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.235]  I mean, he looks older.
[01:11:20.555 --> 01:11:21.095]  He does.
[01:11:21.136 --> 01:11:21.756]  He's gray.
[01:11:21.776 --> 01:11:22.216]  He's bald.
[01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.158]  I mean, he's not a healthy person.
[01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:26.620]  And by the way, I'm just constantly refreshing this space.
[01:11:27.501 --> 01:11:28.281]  The space has started.
[01:11:28.301 --> 01:11:29.502]  Donald Trump and Elon are in it.
[01:11:30.003 --> 01:11:32.945]  It says it has 200,000 people listening, but it won't start.
[01:11:33.185 --> 01:11:34.486]  Well, I mean, here's another issue.
[01:11:34.506 --> 01:11:35.187]  It keeps collapsing.
[01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:41.149]  When Elon put a vote up for me, and it got millions of votes in an hour, it shut down because they crashed it.
[01:11:41.389 --> 01:11:41.589]  Right.
[01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:54.142]  So the EU, I meant to cover it today, I barely mentioned it, it's on Infowars.com, they sent a threatening letter, they're already criminally trying to charge him, got a bunch of civil stuff for billions, and said you better not air this, it may be disinformation.
[01:11:54.482 --> 01:11:57.525]  So there's the EU, that's a top story right there by itself.
[01:11:58.286 --> 01:12:02.991]  There's the EU, Owen, and Harrison saying you better not have him on.
[01:12:03.051 --> 01:12:04.192]  He might say something wrong.
[01:12:04.532 --> 01:12:05.513]  We're watching you.
[01:12:05.593 --> 01:12:08.857]  I mean, and now you've got the UK saying we're going to arrest American citizens.
[01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.859]  These people are really revealing themselves.
[01:12:10.979 --> 01:12:11.960]  Well, let's just be clear.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.102]  This is a strict... I'm sorry to say it.
[01:12:14.302 --> 01:12:16.665]  It's obviously probably true at this point.
[01:12:16.705 --> 01:12:18.727]  I think it's safe to say they can't even get on air.
[01:12:19.107 --> 01:12:20.548]  This was a strategic blunder.
[01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:30.172]  They should have back-ended this transmission, done it in a studio like we do, and then streamed it to X. As a side deal.
[01:12:30.192 --> 01:12:38.954]  They should not have relied on the front-end X technology to make sure this thing got off the ground, because here we are, not shocked at all that it's not.
[01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:46.757]  And that's what's frustrating is, we had to come from the trenches, myself 30 years, you a decade, you guys a long time, where we had to have our own stuff.
[01:12:47.714 --> 01:12:53.939]  And I know that X, I talked to back room folks, is trying to build a studio downtown, is trying to make it to video for like a year.
[01:12:53.979 --> 01:12:54.940]  They haven't been able to do it.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.820]  I get it.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.441]  You have millions of people tuning in and dialing in.
[01:12:57.461 --> 01:12:58.282]  It's hard to get all that done.
[01:12:58.682 --> 01:13:02.585]  Maybe they should have one tier for the host that's video, then another tier that's audio.
[01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:09.175]  So we did get a control room.
[01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:13.178]  Well, hey, let's get Chase Geyser, who's the spaces expert, which I think is great technology.
[01:13:13.198 --> 01:13:13.939]  They're working the bugs out.
[01:13:13.959 --> 01:13:14.759]  We're not criticizing.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.063]  You know, if Musk was not a maverick, we would be, you know, obviously he's a maverick on free speech.
[01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:22.646]  But this is too big to go with an experimental technology, in my opinion.
[01:13:22.686 --> 01:13:25.508]  Well, I mean, actually, I saw the speculation today that it would crash.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.621]  I think you've even said that, right?
[01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:28.983]  Yeah, I mean, I talked about it.
[01:13:29.043 --> 01:13:30.264]  I mean, it was too easy to predict.
[01:13:30.304 --> 01:13:33.888]  I mean, that's not like, that's like predicting it's going to rain in Florida or something.
[01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.149]  Well, because that's the problem.
[01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:37.532]  It's not like everybody connects to a stream.
[01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.895]  The computer takes a user for each listener.
[01:13:41.135 --> 01:13:41.315]  Right.
[01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:46.381]  Which is amazing in its next level, but imagine a talk radio show where every listener is on a phone line.
[01:13:47.242 --> 01:13:49.343]  I mean, if you have like a million listeners, there's no way it's gonna work.
[01:13:50.123 --> 01:13:53.344]  Like, we have a digital phone system that'll take 30,000 calls at once.
[01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:54.745]  That's just what it's scaled up to.
[01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:58.386]  And Wes has told me before, our record was like 24,000 calls in 10 minutes.
[01:13:59.346 --> 01:13:59.666]  Wow.
[01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:00.486]  Yeah, one time.
[01:14:01.247 --> 01:14:03.207]  But the point is, we couldn't actually put them on the board.
[01:14:03.628 --> 01:14:03.848]  Right.
[01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:06.148]  I mean, if we put 100 calls, it'll start crashing the computer.
[01:14:06.188 --> 01:14:09.510]  So, look, Elon, he's the first to admit it.
[01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.790]  He is the guy that takes on too much.
[01:14:12.711 --> 01:14:13.671]  So, you know, we can't
[01:14:16.338 --> 01:14:17.099]  Chase is in the control room?
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.202]  Chase Geiser, you know more about spaces than us.
[01:14:21.722 --> 01:14:23.624]  You're kind of the techie around here of the house.
[01:14:23.644 --> 01:14:24.164]  What's going on?
[01:14:24.504 --> 01:14:27.627]  Well, there's over 205,000 people that are in the space right now.
[01:14:27.687 --> 01:14:31.530]  I'm actually currently in the space because I was one of the first people to join it, so I was able to get in.
[01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:36.273]  But it seems like they're having server capacity issues because so many people are trying to join the space at the same time.
[01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:43.679]  People like the Hodge twins and others are in the replies on both Elon Musk's account and Donald Trump's account saying that they're having a hard time getting in.
[01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:47.066]  I was about to say, I'm not an engineer, but I've noticed the last 20 minutes is about 200,000.
[01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:52.919]  I'm guessing that's the threshold of the server, so millions more are trying to get on.
[01:14:53.348 --> 01:14:54.149]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:54.169 --> 01:15:06.857]  And I know from conversations that I've had with Dick Swardor, because he and Mario, of course, are very intimately involved with the Spaces team at X, that as of a few months ago, the Spaces team was only like half a dozen to a dozen people total, as far as engineers are concerned.
[01:15:07.277 --> 01:15:12.400]  So we're talking about a really kind of bootstrap, lean team dealing with this massive capacity.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:16.143]  I'll tell you what, if this was a Kamala Harris space, I don't think it would be breaking the internet.
[01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:17.143]  Yeah, there'd be 3,000 people on it.
[01:15:17.183 --> 01:15:20.726]  While Donald Trump breaks the internet, Kamala Harris breaks America, right?
[01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:22.066]  Oh, perfect.
[01:15:22.307 --> 01:15:22.787]  Say that again.
[01:15:23.108 --> 01:15:25.661]  While Donald Trump breaks the internet, Kamala Harris breaks America.
[01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:32.293]  Yes, and they're going to spin this tomorrow, and hopefully Elon's on the phone with his engineers yelling at people to up the servers.
[01:15:32.814 --> 01:15:35.815]  You know, though, that they're going to spin it.
[01:15:35.995 --> 01:15:43.560]  Oh, Trump-Musk event fails, but that'll be bigger because then I predict Musk flies to Trump or Trump flies to Musk.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:49.663]  And then, like you said, Owen, it's put out proper on X streaming video that does great.
[01:15:49.683 --> 01:15:52.244]  I mean, we've had up to eight million before our top show.
[01:15:52.664 --> 01:15:55.326]  One time we had eight million on a stream a few months ago.
[01:15:56.066 --> 01:15:57.127]  Routinely a million or two.
[01:15:57.247 --> 01:16:06.110]  Yeah, we stream to X every day and it's fine, but that's a back-loaded stream onto X, not front-loaded through X. Explain it.
[01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:10.091]  It sends one feed that's duplicated and it's delayed a few minutes.
[01:16:10.411 --> 01:16:14.433]  You can't have millions of people all as users.
[01:16:15.713 --> 01:16:19.935]  This is like trying to jam a hundred thousand people into like a tiny nightclub.
[01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:21.296]  Is what this is.
[01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:24.759]  Instead of just putting a camera at the nightclub and then everybody watching.
[01:16:24.799 --> 01:16:27.221]  And again explaining, they all have user capability.
[01:16:27.602 --> 01:16:29.563]  They all have the same rights, which is amazing.
[01:16:30.304 --> 01:16:37.571]  But you've got hundreds of thousands and you see it peak at 205,000 and they're all in there able to speak, but that takes a lot of technology.
[01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:40.733]  When this technology is perfected, it's going to be groundbreaking and incredible.
[01:16:40.773 --> 01:16:45.797]  It already is, but to me... and maybe there was another follow-up strategy behind it.
[01:16:45.817 --> 01:16:50.060]  To me, for Trump, this was too big of a risk to take to rely on this technology.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:50.940]  Doesn't matter.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.681]  I don't make decisions.
[01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:53.402]  Well, don't underestimate that they're hammering it.
[01:16:53.983 --> 01:16:54.763]  Don't underestimate it.
[01:16:54.783 --> 01:16:55.684]  It's not just the users.
[01:16:55.764 --> 01:16:57.545]  It might be a bunch of... Oh, I'm sure.
[01:16:57.585 --> 01:16:59.006]  I mean, the EU sent a threatening letter.
[01:16:59.547 --> 01:17:00.367]  But I'm just curious.
[01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:02.509]  Do we know what the current status is, guys?
[01:17:02.549 --> 01:17:03.870]  Has anybody been able to talk yet?
[01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:04.790]  Let's go back to Chase.
[01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:05.431]  Chase, what do you got?
[01:17:06.175 --> 01:17:08.357]  I just hear elevator music in the space right now.
[01:17:08.577 --> 01:17:09.338]  We're in.
[01:17:09.398 --> 01:17:17.766]  And so what we're going to do is encourage everybody on Twitter who can't get into the space directly to just watch our live stream, because we will be broadcasting as soon as they start speaking.
[01:17:17.786 --> 01:17:21.189]  But obviously, behind the scenes, they're working on something.
[01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:24.232]  They're waiting to fix some of these technical issues before the conversation begins.
[01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:25.273]  But I'm sure everything will be fine.
[01:17:25.293 --> 01:17:29.217]  I just think that they're frantically running around behind the scenes like the Battle of Hoth.
[01:17:29.568 --> 01:17:35.775]  That's a great point, but it's kind of redundant because only people watching us heard that.
[01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:37.677]  We're going to post it on Twitter.
[01:17:37.697 --> 01:17:38.698]  We're going to post it on Twitter.
[01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:39.759]  That's a good point though, Alex.
[01:17:39.799 --> 01:17:40.139]  You're right.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.761]  No, no, no.
[01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:42.482]  It's great.
[01:17:42.502 --> 01:17:44.904]  But it's like, no, but we're saying like, we'll take the load.
[01:17:45.004 --> 01:17:46.085]  Like, share the load.
[01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.687]  Like, you know, like, hey, we got it.
[01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:49.329]  Well, let me, let me, let me explain something.
[01:17:49.389 --> 01:17:51.791]  And Chase has actually done a great job lowering man with cost.
[01:17:52.512 --> 01:17:53.872]  We reach millions a day with these streams.
[01:17:53.912 --> 01:17:56.113]  This is very expensive, even at the best prices we've got.
[01:17:56.133 --> 01:17:57.053]  That's why I'm always up here.
[01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:58.454]  I want to just stay in the game.
[01:17:58.474 --> 01:18:00.094]  That's why I'm like, oh, Jones wants more money.
[01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:04.456]  Folks, it's easy when you're a little provider that can be kicked off YouTube, kicked off Facebook.
[01:18:04.856 --> 01:18:08.617]  We're not a little guy that, you know, that has a show, which are great people.
[01:18:08.777 --> 01:18:09.317]  We boost them.
[01:18:09.677 --> 01:18:11.038]  We're actually a platform.
[01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:13.527]  And what is there?
[01:18:13.547 --> 01:18:18.708]  There's literally X, and then there's Rumble, and then there's Gab at InfoWars, and a few others.
[01:18:18.808 --> 01:18:26.671]  And believe me, I'm not looking like, damn that Rumble doing so well, or damn that Gab, or damn that True Social.
[01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:28.311]  True Social reportedly coming out with video.
[01:18:28.332 --> 01:18:28.712]  That's good.
[01:18:29.152 --> 01:18:34.554]  I'm like, please make me obsolete, man, because it's like being a soldier on the front line with 10 troops.
[01:18:34.874 --> 01:18:35.114]  I want 10,000.
[01:18:35.854 --> 01:18:37.535]  Yeah, it's a whole different level.
[01:18:37.575 --> 01:18:38.396]  So we're doing this.
[01:18:38.416 --> 01:18:39.917]  We're not critiquing anybody.
[01:18:39.957 --> 01:18:41.498]  Like, please make me obsolete.
[01:18:41.578 --> 01:18:41.938]  Please.
[01:18:42.238 --> 01:18:43.079]  That's why I love Musk.
[01:18:43.159 --> 01:18:44.880]  Please, please fix it all.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.621]  Please get this off my back.
[01:18:47.382 --> 01:18:48.202]  No, yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:18:48.242 --> 01:18:50.343]  I'm just, I'm surprised they were able to get in.
[01:18:50.444 --> 01:18:54.506]  I obviously didn't join the space quick enough and I just keep reloading it and just keep saying the space is down.
[01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:54.806]  It's obvious.
[01:18:54.826 --> 01:18:57.908]  I've been watching it for 30, it hits, I'm no engineer.
[01:18:58.769 --> 01:18:59.049]  It's at 205,000.
[01:18:59.109 --> 01:18:59.469]  That's the cap.
[01:19:02.555 --> 01:19:09.581]  I'm surprised they can take 205,000 people, are able to dial into a thing where they can control things and talk?
[01:19:09.721 --> 01:19:14.765]  Yeah, it's like the biggest, I think the biggest venue in the world is the Maracanã in Brazil.
[01:19:14.945 --> 01:19:18.268]  It's like 130,000 or more that they can fit into this stadium.
[01:19:18.548 --> 01:19:19.268]  But that's what it is.
[01:19:19.309 --> 01:19:23.512]  So it's like, you've got 10 million people trying to pour into the Maracanã.
[01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:25.433]  It doesn't fit.
[01:19:25.654 --> 01:19:27.095]  It doesn't hold that many people.
[01:19:27.335 --> 01:19:29.617]  If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit.
[01:19:30.106 --> 01:19:33.067]  So I just think that that's the deal here, and you know what Alex?
[01:19:33.187 --> 01:19:38.850]  Hey, there's a silver lining to everything, and maybe that's ultimately how this is going to end up, is Musk and Trump in the same room.
[01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:43.291]  Well the silver lining is, they should say, cut all the other speakers, and they should talk.
[01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.552]  I don't know why that wasn't the strategy.
[01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.092]  You know me, I would have thrown a fit in five minutes.
[01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:46.753]  Yeah.
[01:19:47.553 --> 01:19:49.714]  I mean, I don't know, that should have been the strategy out of the gates.
[01:19:50.569 --> 01:19:53.610]  I heard you around the office today saying, I was like, are you going to be here?
[01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.770]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.851 --> 01:19:55.271]  I heard you like, it's going to crash.
[01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:56.312]  It's all going to be a disaster.
[01:19:56.332 --> 01:19:56.892]  I'm like, okay.
[01:19:56.952 --> 01:20:01.534]  I'm not even, because I'm not, again, I'm not the one trying to point the finger at X and Musk.
[01:20:01.594 --> 01:20:03.515]  No, but what do you think is going to happen with Elon?
[01:20:03.535 --> 01:20:09.257]  Look, if Elon Musk and Alex Jones got 25 million people on once, but there was only like 20,000 speakers.
[01:20:10.778 --> 01:20:13.340]  Everybody wants to be a speaker at this, that's the difference.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:21.946]  It can handle the listeners, it cannot handle participants, because they have computer largesse, they have interface.
[01:20:22.587 --> 01:20:32.954]  This was too easy to predict, and so, hey, maybe it'll be kind of a troubleshooting thing for X now, and they can figure out how to make it better in the future.
[01:20:34.175 --> 01:20:37.018]  I hope this thing ends up getting off sometime tonight.
[01:20:37.418 --> 01:20:38.819]  If not, though, you know what?
[01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:41.321]  Either way, Trump- Hey, we got an update from Elon Musk.
[01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:44.624]  Elon Musk says there appears to be a massive DDoS attack happening.
[01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:54.332]  So this is not a failure of X so much as it is an actual cyber attack happening, probably backed by people supported by the EU and others who have come out and issued threatening letters today.
[01:20:54.352 --> 01:20:56.534]  I mean, I agree with that because I figure Musk had this updated.
[01:20:56.574 --> 01:20:58.395]  Yeah, I think that probably is it.
[01:20:58.636 --> 01:21:00.998]  So, so, OK, well, tell us more what he said.
[01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:01.418]  Read it to us.
[01:21:01.638 --> 01:21:02.559]  Yeah, let me find it real quick.
[01:21:02.599 --> 01:21:02.819]  Hold on.
[01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.160]  Yeah, this is a big deal.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.982]  Because the EU literally, I covered it a little bit today.
[01:21:07.022 --> 01:21:07.842]  I should have covered it more.
[01:21:08.142 --> 01:21:11.504]  The EU sent a letter saying, we're watching everything you do and we're going to criminally charge you.
[01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.266]  So this is what he said two minutes ago.
[01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:20.230]  Elon Musk has 45,000 likes now, said, there appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X working on shutting it down.
[01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.472]  I assume he's referring to the DDoS attack.
[01:21:22.512 --> 01:21:22.772]  He says,
[01:21:23.132 --> 01:21:27.215]  Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.
[01:21:27.255 --> 01:21:33.919]  So something is going to happen tonight for sure, but there's definitely a cyber attack happening and this is an attack on freedom of speech right before our eyes happening in real time.
[01:21:33.939 --> 01:21:44.727]  Well, I want you to tweet at him because he's smarter than I am and say, will you please just put out a video screen of the x-spaces because your video system is way more redundant.
[01:21:45.427 --> 01:21:47.388]  Because he's calling it, oh, listeners.
[01:21:47.488 --> 01:21:48.749]  No, they're participants.
[01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:51.530]  It's why it has more bandwidth, because they have all that interface power.
[01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:57.613]  I'm not a technician, but I know the fact that a system where each person can interface and has all these controls.
[01:21:57.654 --> 01:21:57.914]  All right.
[01:21:57.934 --> 01:22:00.315]  There is some speaking happening in the space right now.
[01:22:00.635 --> 01:22:01.095]  OK, go to it.
[01:22:01.135 --> 01:22:01.436]  Go to it.
[01:22:01.476 --> 01:22:01.756]  Here it is.
[01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:04.817]  Well, it looks like it went away.
[01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:08.879]  They just did a quick update in the space where they said there was a cyber attack, and now they're back to the old music.
[01:22:08.899 --> 01:22:09.420]  Sorry about that, guys.
[01:22:10.066 --> 01:22:11.147]  Hey, I love this attack.
[01:22:11.248 --> 01:22:12.669]  It only makes it bigger.
[01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.812]  Most people are like, oh God, we're attacked.
[01:22:14.832 --> 01:22:15.453]  We're going home.
[01:22:15.854 --> 01:22:17.816]  This is what happens in the info war, folks.
[01:22:18.357 --> 01:22:20.159]  I mean, you got Elon Musk and Donald Trump.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.902]  Obviously, millions want to hear it.
[01:22:22.462 --> 01:22:25.486]  And I tell you, my gut level, which I said, I guarantee it's true.
[01:22:26.485 --> 01:22:30.926]  He probably boosted all the bandwidth, did major updates, but there was an attack on top of it.
[01:22:31.366 --> 01:22:33.486]  Because again, like I told you, it came out.
[01:22:33.506 --> 01:22:34.866]  Remember when they had to vote about bringing me back?
[01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:35.627]  That got attacked, Owen.
[01:22:36.107 --> 01:22:45.408]  Well, and I think it was the UK government that made that statement talking about, hey, you better not let Trump speak or, you know, whatever the official statement was.
[01:22:45.468 --> 01:22:46.669]  It was the EU and UK.
[01:22:47.069 --> 01:22:54.570]  Well, Musk did issue a reply earlier today, and to put it short and sweet, he said, fuck right off.
[01:22:55.461 --> 01:23:04.768]  So, I don't know what the EU or the UK government thinks it has to say about our speech in America, but I'm gonna go ahead and agree with Elon Musk on that.
[01:23:04.788 --> 01:23:05.288]  Yeah, fuck off.
[01:23:05.489 --> 01:23:09.572]  But notice how they picked one show, because they can't stop all of us.
[01:23:10.012 --> 01:23:13.274]  So they act like if they could just stop this interview, which will only make it bigger.
[01:23:13.294 --> 01:23:15.396]  In fact, I hope they shut it down tonight.
[01:23:15.696 --> 01:23:19.239]  When Trump comes on in three days, it'll be 300 million instead of 100 million.
[01:23:19.519 --> 01:23:22.982]  Musk should just fly down to Mar-a-Lago, just have the sit-down interview.
[01:23:24.182 --> 01:23:24.703]  It'll be bigger.
[01:23:25.717 --> 01:23:28.799]  Yeah, but again, I've only experienced this.
[01:23:29.279 --> 01:23:31.660]  25 million viewers when he talked to me for two and a half hours.
[01:23:32.401 --> 01:23:35.362]  And then 25, 40, it was like, I quit counting.
[01:23:36.163 --> 01:23:36.583]  50 million.
[01:23:37.063 --> 01:23:37.984]  That was Alex Jones.
[01:23:38.024 --> 01:23:39.705]  They want to see the radicals, Owen.
[01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:41.166]  But it is possible.
[01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:48.592]  Trump flew a popular streamer to Mar-a-Lago, I think it was last week, Aiden Ross.
[01:23:49.032 --> 01:23:51.213]  They ended up getting 50 million views, 24 hours.
[01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.293]  I don't know where the number is now.
[01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.894]  The point is that it can be done.
[01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:58.736]  The platforms exist to have it done successfully.
[01:23:59.376 --> 01:24:03.478]  And so, to me, that is the foolproof strategy to go with.
[01:24:04.058 --> 01:24:04.998]  I'm not Donald Trump.
[01:24:05.078 --> 01:24:06.139]  I don't know if he was expecting this.
[01:24:06.279 --> 01:24:07.959]  I don't know if he's frustrated by this.
[01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:09.560]  He's using this to test his platform.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:10.961]  I agree.
[01:24:12.222 --> 01:24:14.364]  That's part of it, but I think he's telling the truth.
[01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:16.946]  Because we get hit with DDoS every time we have a big interview.
[01:24:17.467 --> 01:24:21.831]  Yeah, well, we had to set up a fail-safe curtain in front of our stuff now.
[01:24:21.851 --> 01:24:26.555]  Well, that's why, you notice I've told you guys, I don't tell you what to do because I respect you, you gotta do what you want.
[01:24:26.856 --> 01:24:27.416]  We agree about 95%.
[01:24:28.477 --> 01:24:32.441]  But I will say, when you got a really big guest, you might not want to announce it right away.
[01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:32.881]  Right.
[01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:33.942]  Because that's when they hit you.
[01:24:35.524 --> 01:24:35.784]  Harrison?
[01:24:36.095 --> 01:24:47.762]  No, I'm just, he says Elon Musk just posted 42 seconds ago, he's tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today, so he's saying it's not a matter of the number of people joining in, it is the DDoS tech.
[01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:49.984]  That was a retweet of the DDoS statement, yeah.
[01:24:50.244 --> 01:24:51.324]  So there you go.
[01:24:51.645 --> 01:24:54.166]  Why would the EU and the UK threaten to not do this interview?
[01:24:54.446 --> 01:24:56.267]  Think of the arrogance of these people, man.
[01:24:56.668 --> 01:24:59.570]  They're telling us we can't hear our president and Elon Musk?
[01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:00.190]  I mean, what?
[01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:01.130]  That's what I was wondering.
[01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:05.991]  It almost seemed like an act of desperation, because they knew Elon Musk wasn't going to go, oh, okay, sorry.
[01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:09.552]  Yeah, so why would you come out and make a demand that you know is not going to be met?
[01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:11.752]  I mean, it's just humiliating for them.
[01:25:11.792 --> 01:25:13.373]  Yeah, this is Cyber Command doing this.
[01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:22.914]  Well, he's been really harsh on what's been going on in the UK for the last couple weeks, and so I think that they kind of took that personally.
[01:25:22.934 --> 01:25:25.135]  And by the way, that's a beta test, as you know, for the rest of the world.
[01:25:25.933 --> 01:25:26.994]  Well, it's happening already.
[01:25:27.014 --> 01:25:29.615]  There was a story out of Buffalo, New York.
[01:25:30.355 --> 01:25:34.858]  And look, it's such a... People just need to see the end result.
[01:25:34.918 --> 01:25:36.439]  Forget about... Forget about...
[01:25:37.352 --> 01:25:47.334]  These ancient holy wars, or this religion versus that religion, and just look at the end result of what's happened in England, and realize that something similar is going to happen in the United States.
[01:25:47.614 --> 01:25:55.415]  Whether it's illegal migrant gangs and criminal gangs, or whether it's a new religion that has a base here.
[01:25:55.776 --> 01:26:02.717]  A Muslim group just purchased a cathedral in Buffalo, New York for a quarter million dollars, and they're going to turn it into a mosque.
[01:26:03.337 --> 01:26:06.559]  And so this is an ancient, beautiful Catholic cathedral.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.502]  The Catholics couldn't raise a quarter million dollars to purchase it and save it, so the Muslims did.
[01:26:11.123 --> 01:26:12.984]  And so, it's like, where do you think this goes?
[01:26:13.004 --> 01:26:13.605]  It's a gorgeous building.
[01:26:13.905 --> 01:26:14.545]  It's incredible.
[01:26:14.625 --> 01:26:16.507]  I don't know why, I mean, the Vatican couldn't step in?
[01:26:16.527 --> 01:26:17.628]  They can't build these today.
[01:26:18.148 --> 01:26:19.409]  So let's explain something.
[01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.430]  Key point that Owen just made.
[01:26:22.972 --> 01:26:26.154]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is history happening right now.
[01:26:26.734 --> 01:26:28.015]  And they're trying to censor this.
[01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:31.318]  They're trying to control this because they're so scared of what you're saying, Owen.
[01:26:32.816 --> 01:26:51.329]  So I just don't want to live in an America that looks like the UK, or specifically Britain, where the traditional English people are basically shoved aside and told, no, this replacement population now gets favorite treatment.
[01:26:51.549 --> 01:26:54.851]  And that's the problem of Westerners is we're so individual, which is good.
[01:26:55.011 --> 01:26:56.092]  We don't organize.
[01:26:56.152 --> 01:26:56.973]  The Muslims do.
[01:26:57.073 --> 01:26:58.214]  And it's their religion.
[01:26:58.694 --> 01:26:59.775]  They take over everywhere.
[01:26:59.795 --> 01:27:00.755]  They push everybody out.
[01:27:00.835 --> 01:27:01.376]  It's a fact.
[01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.919]  I don't think it'll be Muslims here, per se.
[01:27:04.039 --> 01:27:09.366]  I think when it comes here, it's going to be illegal alien gangs, I think.
[01:27:10.047 --> 01:27:11.048]  And pervert groups.
[01:27:11.912 --> 01:27:15.655]  And so that's what... The Rainbow Pedophile Coalition.
[01:27:15.695 --> 01:27:16.536]  This was set up.
[01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:26.844]  If you look at what's happened in England in the last few years, this was set up for the Muslim population to essentially assert its dominance over the English culture and civilization.
[01:27:26.885 --> 01:27:28.146]  That's what was being set up.
[01:27:28.266 --> 01:27:32.869]  Now we're finally seeing the final result and people are shocked because the government's coming out and saying, nope.
[01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:36.773]  If you're a white Englishman, sit down, shut up, you're going to prison.
[01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:45.880]  If you're an Islamic man, you can go ahead and do whatever the hell you want, attack anybody, take over the civilization, it's fine, we're going to protect you in that endeavor, that's how woke we are.
[01:27:46.421 --> 01:27:55.529]  What I see being set up right now in the United States is you have all these illegal aliens coming here and they're immediately being put on entitlement programs and welfare programs.
[01:27:56.169 --> 01:28:16.867]  And so, what's going to happen here is the day that these entitlements run dry, or the day that their welfare state gets cut off, they're going to start rioting, they're going to start burning cities, they're going to start destroying our country, and when people try to step up and stop it, or call it out, or say anything, you'll be the one that gets arrested.
[01:28:16.907 --> 01:28:19.189]  You'll be called a racist, a xenophobe.
[01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:21.772]  What's really gotten, even me just putting it out, I said like 10 million.
[01:28:22.592 --> 01:28:25.474]  An update from Elon Musk a minute ago.
[01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:33.799]  He says, we will proceed with the smaller number of concurrent listeners at 8.30 Eastern Time, so that's in two minutes from now, and then post the unedited audio immediately thereafter.
[01:28:33.859 --> 01:28:34.999]  So they are solving the problem.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.040]  Good.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.862]  That was a smart move to cut back so people can get on.
[01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:42.484]  That means they'll block the people coming in with the DDoS attacks.
[01:28:42.504 --> 01:28:44.325]  So let me just throw this out real quick.
[01:28:46.806 --> 01:28:50.947]  The point I'm trying to get at here is, this is information warfare.
[01:28:51.507 --> 01:28:53.688]  And so, who do I have in there posting on X?
[01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:56.488]  Because I see us with millions of viewers already tuned in to us.
[01:28:57.088 --> 01:29:00.689]  So I want to put this out on X as another repost of the live feed.
[01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:01.249]  You guys got me?
[01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:05.650]  I want to put what I'm about to say out.
[01:29:06.051 --> 01:29:07.051]  I can do it myself right now.
[01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:11.612]  On X of the live show feed, I want to put this out right now.
[01:29:11.632 --> 01:29:12.092]  You guys ready?
[01:29:13.464 --> 01:29:14.745]  Yeah, yeah, I'm listening to you right now.
[01:29:14.765 --> 01:29:16.206]  All right, I want you to retweet this.
[01:29:16.266 --> 01:29:24.570]  I want you to post this on X. Elon Trump interview under hack attack.
[01:29:27.972 --> 01:29:32.035]  Watch censored feed here, which we're about to launch, which we're taking.
[01:29:32.495 --> 01:29:32.955]  It's all true.
[01:29:33.616 --> 01:29:36.677]  And that'll go super viral, because people need to... The average person doesn't know they're being blocked.
[01:29:36.697 --> 01:29:37.698]  They don't know why they can get on.
[01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:38.699]  They're trying to find out.
[01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:39.279]  We got to tell them.
[01:29:39.479 --> 01:29:40.620]  We're already telling them what just happened.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.120]  See, it's not hype.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:41.580]  It's real.
[01:29:42.401 --> 01:29:42.561]  So...
[01:29:43.723 --> 01:29:44.183]  Breaking!
[01:29:46.525 --> 01:29:49.028]  Elon Trump interview under hack attack.
[01:29:49.588 --> 01:29:51.710]  See censored interview here live.
[01:29:53.231 --> 01:29:53.792]  That's the headline.
[01:29:54.352 --> 01:29:57.455]  And you see, we're not even doing it in the future.
[01:29:57.535 --> 01:29:58.416]  It already happened.
[01:29:58.916 --> 01:30:03.740]  But the people trying to hit the Elon link aren't able to get this because it shut down.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.381]  We're telling them.
[01:30:05.021 --> 01:30:07.323]  So you heard the headline right now.
[01:30:07.343 --> 01:30:09.145]  You know, exclusive.
[01:30:10.282 --> 01:30:12.443]  Elon Trump interviewed under hack attack.
[01:30:13.244 --> 01:30:16.186]  Hear and see censored interview at this link.
[01:30:16.286 --> 01:30:16.626]  Sound good?
[01:30:16.646 --> 01:30:18.347]  Something like that?
[01:30:20.555 --> 01:30:21.495]  All right, fire that out.
[01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.036]  And again, to listeners, that's all you can do.
[01:30:24.096 --> 01:30:27.538]  Like, take what's happening and don't, like, oh God, they're attacking us.
[01:30:27.998 --> 01:30:28.538]  We're beaten.
[01:30:28.558 --> 01:30:29.699]  I know most of you understand this.
[01:30:30.139 --> 01:30:31.960]  But use it against the enemy.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.640]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:33.920]  Owen?
[01:30:34.261 --> 01:30:37.102]  James O'Keefe calls that distribution by proxy.
[01:30:37.142 --> 01:30:38.642]  And so that's essentially what we're doing.
[01:30:38.662 --> 01:30:43.224]  We're acting as a proxy for this X space between Trump and Musk.
[01:30:43.484 --> 01:30:43.845]  Exactly.
[01:30:43.885 --> 01:30:46.806]  Whatever happens to their feed, we're jacked in boosting it.
[01:30:47.446 --> 01:30:48.486]  So they gotta attack us too.
[01:30:48.627 --> 01:30:50.347]  And so basically now... We're all Spartacus.
[01:30:50.547 --> 01:31:03.593]  So basically now all we have to do is act as one person taking that feed, and then we just feed it through our amplified feed to the millions of people that tune into us, and it only affects the X spaces.
[01:31:03.913 --> 01:31:07.255]  And that means the enemy DDoSing their link, we get around them.
[01:31:07.455 --> 01:31:07.615]  Yes.
[01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:11.060]  So I was actually able to join the space somehow.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.240]  Over half a million people have joined.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.941]  I'm listening to the elevator music right now.
[01:31:14.961 --> 01:31:20.543]  It's coming from Trump's status, but I don't... Maybe I'm in here?
[01:31:20.603 --> 01:31:20.963]  I don't know.
[01:31:20.983 --> 01:31:22.384]  I wonder how many people they're going to let in.
[01:31:22.404 --> 01:31:23.944]  It's under massive attack, so... Yeah.
[01:31:24.204 --> 01:31:24.804]  But don't worry.
[01:31:25.485 --> 01:31:27.765]  They're going to run headlines tomorrow, even if they don't get on there tonight.
[01:31:27.885 --> 01:31:28.386]  Oh, Trump.
[01:31:28.706 --> 01:31:29.546]  Oh, big crash.
[01:31:29.586 --> 01:31:30.066]  Big joke.
[01:31:30.086 --> 01:31:30.266]  No.
[01:31:31.026 --> 01:31:33.767]  I predict when Trump finally does the next Elon interview, he'll be five times bigger.
[01:31:34.348 --> 01:31:34.508]  What?
[01:31:34.968 --> 01:31:35.348]  800 million views?
[01:31:36.725 --> 01:31:38.467]  100 million in 24 hours, guaranteed.
[01:31:38.627 --> 01:31:41.870]  Yeah, but I mean, Tucker got 200 million with Putin.
[01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:43.231]  I think this should be bigger.
[01:31:44.873 --> 01:31:45.233]  Could be.
[01:31:45.974 --> 01:31:46.314]  Could be.
[01:31:47.695 --> 01:31:48.896]  If people get pissed off.
[01:31:49.577 --> 01:31:50.658]  Chase Geiser, what's the latest?
[01:31:51.604 --> 01:31:54.185]  Yeah, so there's nothing new to develop, but we got that tweet out.
[01:31:54.245 --> 01:31:55.626]  We are encouraging everybody to watch.
[01:31:55.926 --> 01:32:01.448]  If they can't get into the space, they can listen to it uncensored on our live streams on X or at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:32:01.928 --> 01:32:04.970]  But we're still getting elevator music inside the space.
[01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:08.251]  We are in the space, so we will be able to broadcast it unless they start another space.
[01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:09.191]  But I don't anticipate that.
[01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:10.612]  And by the way, people can criticize Elon.
[01:32:10.632 --> 01:32:12.013]  This is a revolutionary technology.
[01:32:12.033 --> 01:32:14.314]  This is what it takes, like a space program.
[01:32:14.334 --> 01:32:16.654]  I mean, this is... Look at this thing, man.
[01:32:18.075 --> 01:32:18.315]  What?
[01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:21.418]  I'm just, I hope it takes off tonight.
[01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:22.740]  I just, it's too big.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.542]  I think this, you know, we've got too big to rig for the election.
[01:32:25.963 --> 01:32:27.644]  This is like too big to go.
[01:32:28.145 --> 01:32:29.586]  This is like too big to launch.
[01:32:29.646 --> 01:32:30.247]  Too big to stream.
[01:32:30.287 --> 01:32:31.208]  Too big to stream.
[01:32:31.388 --> 01:32:32.309]  Too big to launch.
[01:32:32.749 --> 01:32:35.031]  Because he says we want to limit the people that can get in.
[01:32:35.632 --> 01:32:37.133]  The requests aren't going to stop coming.
[01:32:37.153 --> 01:32:37.614]  Right.
[01:32:38.414 --> 01:32:39.014]  Well, exactly.
[01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:41.175]  I'm not an engineer, but that's what they call a slow Loris attack.
[01:32:41.475 --> 01:32:46.937]  It doesn't matter if you try to block it, your computer still has to take requests, and a hacker just goes, request, request, request, request.
[01:32:47.297 --> 01:32:50.999]  This is like any big, if you look at any big famous international soccer match.
[01:32:51.099 --> 01:33:01.183]  This actually just happened in Miami last month, where there's so many people that want to go to this game, that the crowds outside of the stadium are just so massive.
[01:33:01.223 --> 01:33:01.723]  You can't get in.
[01:33:02.003 --> 01:33:07.886]  You can't get in and so people just end up climbing up the rafters and up the fence and into the scaffolding.
[01:33:08.186 --> 01:33:10.827]  They had to cancel the Copa America game.
[01:33:10.847 --> 01:33:15.609]  They had to delay the Copa America game like an hour and a half in Miami last month because it was like the same thing.
[01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:16.789]  There were too many people there.
[01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:18.030]  So it's a sign of success.
[01:33:18.621 --> 01:33:20.062]  It's a sign of how popular it is.
[01:33:20.222 --> 01:33:21.342]  It's a sign of how big it is.
[01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.543]  It's basically the biggest event.
[01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:25.264]  I mean, biggest international soccer matches on the planet.
[01:33:25.364 --> 01:33:29.366]  They have to delay the games because too many people show up and they basically shut down the stadium.
[01:33:29.726 --> 01:33:32.487]  So, that's what you're getting the equivalent of right here.
[01:33:32.547 --> 01:33:34.648]  It does look like people are able to get in now.
[01:33:34.869 --> 01:33:36.389]  There's over 770,000 people in the space.
[01:33:36.429 --> 01:33:38.030]  I was able to join for my personal account.
[01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:39.751]  Dario was able to join as well and others.
[01:33:39.891 --> 01:33:42.292]  Alright, so maybe they were able to block the DDoS attack.
[01:33:42.732 --> 01:33:44.934]  Oh God, did I just see a Krasutin head pop up?
[01:33:45.994 --> 01:33:50.097]  I'm gonna kill myself.
[01:33:50.117 --> 01:33:52.178]  I heard Krasutin has a raging clue.
[01:33:52.999 --> 01:33:54.139]  What does that mean?
[01:33:54.459 --> 01:33:56.141]  It's a South Park episode.
[01:33:56.461 --> 01:33:57.241]  I'll send it to you later.
[01:33:57.281 --> 01:33:58.342]  You'll like it.
[01:33:58.462 --> 01:33:58.882]  I'm 50 now.
[01:33:58.962 --> 01:34:00.843]  Half the stuff you guys said, I'm good.
[01:34:01.864 --> 01:34:07.307]  It's just the Hardy boys like to find raging clues and disappear into a closet together.
[01:34:07.868 --> 01:34:07.948]  Oh.
[01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:09.769]  When they find a raging clue.
[01:34:09.849 --> 01:34:11.750]  I only figured out what a bunch of stuff was years ago.
[01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:15.611]  I'm like, people are like, uh, I'm not going to even say it.
[01:34:15.631 --> 01:34:16.051]  You know, look.
[01:34:16.091 --> 01:34:17.852]  People are like telling me to sex shove it.
[01:34:17.872 --> 01:34:18.752]  I was like, what's that mean?
[01:34:19.753 --> 01:34:20.333]  I'm sorry.
[01:34:20.353 --> 01:34:21.673]  Like where a tampon goes?
[01:34:21.693 --> 01:34:23.134]  Yeah.
[01:34:23.854 --> 01:34:24.694]  I'm sorry, man.
[01:34:24.754 --> 01:34:26.655]  I know how to order a beer and order a steak.
[01:34:27.415 --> 01:34:28.535]  I don't understand all this weird.
[01:34:28.555 --> 01:34:31.356]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean, but like Hardy Boys.
[01:34:32.277 --> 01:34:33.257]  You would enjoy this.
[01:34:33.357 --> 01:34:34.037]  It's pretty funny.
[01:34:34.137 --> 01:34:35.017]  It's a classic Southpaw.
[01:34:35.037 --> 01:34:35.978]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:36.318]  I'm like,
[01:34:36.863 --> 01:34:40.485]  If somebody showed you the clip, you would think, is this the animated Krasenstein Brothers?
[01:34:40.665 --> 01:34:41.525]  It's very accurate.
[01:34:41.786 --> 01:34:46.468]  See, I just grew up on South Park, and so, like, I just remember every episode.
[01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:49.910]  I love the South Park records here.
[01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:50.650]  It's like gay fish.
[01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:52.311]  I'm a gay fish.
[01:34:52.791 --> 01:34:54.652]  Did you see the Strong Woman?
[01:34:54.992 --> 01:34:56.613]  I'm a strong woman!
[01:34:56.673 --> 01:35:02.356]  I remember, like, the famous wrestler, step into a slim gym.
[01:35:02.816 --> 01:35:03.877]  Yeah, yeah, Strong Woman.
[01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:06.129]  What was that guy, Macho Man Randy Savage?
[01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.870]  Randy Savage, yeah.
[01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:08.672]  Beats up the woman, but it's not actually a woman.
[01:35:08.692 --> 01:35:09.293]  It's a strong woman.
[01:35:09.333 --> 01:35:11.436]  Or the guy wants to be a dolphin, so they put a dolphin fin on him.
[01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:12.257]  Dolphinplasty.
[01:35:12.597 --> 01:35:16.983]  Man, and those episodes are from like a decade before any of that actually happened.
[01:35:17.023 --> 01:35:17.945]  That's what's crazy.
[01:35:18.185 --> 01:35:19.086]  That's the foresight.
[01:35:19.226 --> 01:35:19.406]  Yeah.
[01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:23.034]  Sometimes I don't get the jokes and people say, you know about this, right?
[01:35:23.114 --> 01:35:24.376]  And I'm like, uh, no.
[01:35:24.396 --> 01:35:26.438]  Because I watch South Park some, it's funny.
[01:35:26.859 --> 01:35:28.961]  I just, like, most of the time I'm not watching entertainment.
[01:35:29.001 --> 01:35:29.381]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:29.682 --> 01:35:33.706]  I'm gonna show that woman what a strong woman really is.
[01:35:34.227 --> 01:35:38.812]  I'm gonna get into that ring and I'm gonna crush her, because I'm the real woman.
[01:35:39.585 --> 01:35:40.306]  So this is kind of crazy.
[01:35:40.346 --> 01:35:41.566]  So I was able to get into the space.
[01:35:42.047 --> 01:35:44.949]  It's gone up by about 100,000 people per minute since I got in.
[01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.270]  So it's at 850 now.
[01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:47.671]  Trump is still in.
[01:35:48.031 --> 01:35:49.312]  Elon Musk is nowhere to be found now.
[01:35:49.352 --> 01:35:51.454]  I don't know where Elon Musk went in this space.
[01:35:51.994 --> 01:35:54.996]  Look, it's a new technology like rocket testing.
[01:35:55.037 --> 01:35:55.457]  We get it.
[01:35:55.517 --> 01:35:56.137]  It's not a problem.
[01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:56.978]  But I agree.
[01:35:57.418 --> 01:36:01.802]  He should have been in a studio with Trump sending a video feed out where the space is on top of it.
[01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:05.510]  Maybe they live and they learn.
[01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:08.672]  We'll see if this thing can even take off successfully tonight.
[01:36:09.153 --> 01:36:10.354]  Well, we appreciate everybody tuning in.
[01:36:10.374 --> 01:36:11.975]  So let's shift gears while we're waiting.
[01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:14.277]  We basically could play for 30 minutes, which is fine.
[01:36:14.577 --> 01:36:16.078]  This is good to have a technological critique.
[01:36:16.138 --> 01:36:16.879]  Oh, we've had fun.
[01:36:16.899 --> 01:36:17.600]  This has been fun.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.283]  But what's the biggest news right now for me?
[01:36:22.844 --> 01:36:26.046]  It's Kamala who helped pass the law to hire 86,000 IRS agents to target
[01:36:30.706 --> 01:36:31.046]  We're good.
[01:36:48.504 --> 01:36:54.069]  Ukraine has attacked Russia five days ago and gone like 50 miles in and there's a NATO's backing in.
[01:36:54.369 --> 01:36:56.170]  That's a total insane escalation.
[01:36:56.731 --> 01:36:59.874]  And then we've got, I mean, it's all just cuckoo town.
[01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:01.054]  So I mean, what else?
[01:37:01.295 --> 01:37:02.155]  There's a lot to talk about.
[01:37:02.215 --> 01:37:04.898]  Well, geopolitically, there have been some major developments.
[01:37:05.098 --> 01:37:09.161]  I mean, I don't know, that's like a long stream broadcast to get into that.
[01:37:09.361 --> 01:37:11.043]  I think when we look at the US election, though,
[01:37:12.475 --> 01:37:15.138]  I think, again, it's so stunning.
[01:37:15.338 --> 01:37:21.525]  It's so stunning to sit here and watch these Harris rallies where now she's campaigning on strong borders.
[01:37:22.006 --> 01:37:26.831]  She's literally stealing Trump's campaign policy, no tax on tips.
[01:37:27.272 --> 01:37:27.872]  I mean, what's next?
[01:37:27.892 --> 01:37:28.853]  She's going to come out in a red hat.
[01:37:28.873 --> 01:37:29.294]  She's like Joy Reid.
[01:37:29.314 --> 01:37:30.515]  She may have gold hair tomorrow.
[01:37:30.675 --> 01:37:31.356]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:37:31.376 --> 01:37:32.517]  She's going to come out in a red hat.
[01:37:35.561 --> 01:37:37.222]  They're running the camo hat now.
[01:37:37.262 --> 01:37:44.389]  They're not just taking Trump's policies, they're trying to steal the style, the Make America Great Again style, and make it a little bit different.
[01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.772]  It's like the off-brand Make America Great Again.
[01:37:46.852 --> 01:37:49.915]  Here's the outside thing that stuns me that I can't help but notice though.
[01:37:50.996 --> 01:37:56.240]  The absolute state of brainwashing that the American Democrat is under.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:02.744]  I mean, we are talking complete and total mind control where they don't even blink an eye.
[01:38:03.064 --> 01:38:08.068]  Kamala Harris is running against her own administration.
[01:38:08.808 --> 01:38:11.810]  She's literally running against the economy that she created.
[01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:12.871]  She claims she's going to do
[01:38:14.605 --> 01:38:15.706]  Trump was honest in June.
[01:38:15.726 --> 01:38:16.868]  He goes, I was in Vegas.
[01:38:17.448 --> 01:38:21.072]  A waitress comes over and says, why don't you get rid of taxes on tips?
[01:38:21.733 --> 01:38:22.714]  He goes, great idea.
[01:38:23.435 --> 01:38:28.500]  And then she was the one that engineered and bragged to squeeze waitresses.
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:29.341]  It's a policy.
[01:38:29.601 --> 01:38:31.644]  So it's one thing if she stole it.
[01:38:32.204 --> 01:38:35.308]  It's another thing that she's the queen of raping
[01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:37.439]  Service workers.
[01:38:37.619 --> 01:38:41.144]  I mean, you cannot, it's such a perfect fraud.
[01:38:41.204 --> 01:38:44.689]  Let the lemmings stand behind her and cheer and clap!
[01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:46.211]  Like, they love it!
[01:38:47.145 --> 01:38:58.455]  And I'm just sitting here, because if you look at the original founding of this country and the political science when it first was founded, we've really kind of gone off pasture in a lot of ways.
[01:38:58.495 --> 01:38:58.875]  Oh really?
[01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:05.060]  Well, I don't mean just the basic constitutional violations, but I mean how the actual science is applied.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.682]  Like, these people shouldn't vote.
[01:39:07.242 --> 01:39:11.165]  I'm like, I'm to the point now where I'm like, F your voting rights, bro.
[01:39:11.706 --> 01:39:18.091]  Did you see the women, I never played it today, can you SQ that up, of the Democrat Party women howling like animals?
[01:39:18.792 --> 01:39:20.373]  Saying, she a woman, she black.
[01:39:20.393 --> 01:39:21.194]  Have you seen this clip?
[01:39:21.374 --> 01:39:25.277]  Yeah, and that's what they're, they're three big issues.
[01:39:25.357 --> 01:39:29.521]  When Kamala Harris voters were asked, what are your three main issues?
[01:39:29.681 --> 01:39:32.143]  It was abortion, she's black, and she's a woman.
[01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:33.324]  Congratulations.
[01:39:33.664 --> 01:39:34.445]  Okay, so abortion.
[01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:38.369]  What percentage of Americans does abortion actually apply to every year?
[01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:38.750]  Very small.
[01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:40.231]  A tiny fraction?
[01:39:40.331 --> 01:39:40.812]  Five percent.
[01:39:41.493 --> 01:39:46.178]  And so, okay, so that doesn't really apply to many people as a political issue.
[01:39:46.258 --> 01:39:48.500]  And then you're going to go into she's a black woman?
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.864]  Well, what if she's a black woman and her policy is I'm going to stab you in the throat?
[01:39:53.069 --> 01:39:54.550]  So, okay, well, she's a black woman.
[01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:55.590]  She's going to stab me in the throat.
[01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:56.191]  So that's great.
[01:39:56.231 --> 01:39:56.851]  I'm going to vote for her.
[01:39:57.371 --> 01:39:58.432]  I mean, this is where we're at.
[01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:02.614]  So you need to have a basic civics test or a basic political IQ test.
[01:40:02.694 --> 01:40:02.994]  No, I agree.
[01:40:03.014 --> 01:40:03.995]  Did you guys find the club?
[01:40:05.836 --> 01:40:06.356]  Yeah, I haven't seen it.
[01:40:06.376 --> 01:40:07.337]  I went to play it this morning.
[01:40:07.397 --> 01:40:08.137]  I didn't get to it.
[01:40:08.157 --> 01:40:10.579]  They're literally howling at a rally.
[01:40:10.779 --> 01:40:12.760]  They went, we're gonna win!
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.020]  We're gonna win!
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:14.841]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:40:15.081 --> 01:40:15.921]  Like, my God.
[01:40:16.001 --> 01:40:17.802]  Oh, here it is.
[01:40:17.842 --> 01:40:18.103]  Here it is.
[01:40:18.143 --> 01:40:18.523]  Here's the club.
[01:40:22.949 --> 01:40:27.551]  I mean, not to be, you know, cocky, but I'm optimistic.
[01:40:28.191 --> 01:40:39.456]  I've always been a supporter of, you know, she's a woman, and she's black, and she'll be the first president candidate that I think she will win.
[01:40:40.096 --> 01:40:46.539]  And like I said, I'm all about equal access and equal women.
[01:40:47.239 --> 01:40:48.360]  Look at that long bottom.
[01:40:49.875 --> 01:40:51.096]  These are full-blown lunatics.
[01:40:51.136 --> 01:40:51.836]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:52.056 --> 01:40:52.136]  No, 100%.
[01:40:52.297 --> 01:41:06.926]  Well, the other video is the Taylor Hansen video where it's a woman saying, I'm a gay trans man, which means she's a straight woman, and she's saying, I have ear piercings and colored hair, and if Trump gets elected, I won't be able to look like this anymore.
[01:41:07.006 --> 01:41:08.627]  And it's literal delusion.
[01:41:08.667 --> 01:41:11.769]  They literally think that Trump is going to pass a law to stop dying your hair.
[01:41:11.789 --> 01:41:16.411]  Well, they were talking about one trans person one time, and they go, well, they're attacking me.
[01:41:16.491 --> 01:41:17.272]  It's within me.
[01:41:17.412 --> 01:41:18.373]  I feel it's within me.
[01:41:19.252 --> 01:41:20.372]  It's like, no, no one cares.
[01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:21.092]  Leave us alone.
[01:41:21.112 --> 01:41:21.612]  Nobody cares.
[01:41:21.872 --> 01:41:22.513]  Nobody cares at all.
[01:41:22.713 --> 01:41:25.433]  And it's, but it's, it's like literal delusion.
[01:41:25.453 --> 01:41:27.193]  So I agree with you, Owen.
[01:41:27.213 --> 01:41:28.994]  It's like, I can't argue with that person.
[01:41:29.014 --> 01:41:30.814]  They're, they're campaigning against Bigfoot.
[01:41:31.194 --> 01:41:31.834]  He doesn't exist.
[01:41:31.874 --> 01:41:33.715]  So it's like they're campaigning against a boogie boat.
[01:41:33.735 --> 01:41:34.535]  They are live, folks.
[01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.255]  They are live.
[01:41:35.275 --> 01:41:38.695]  This is Donald Trump and Elon Musk now, 42 minutes in.
[01:41:38.735 --> 01:41:39.135]  Here it is.
[01:41:39.836 --> 01:41:47.857]  ... service attack against our servers and saturated all of our, all of our data lines.
[01:41:48.789 --> 01:41:52.050]  Basically, hundreds of gigabits of data were saturated.
[01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:59.051]  We think we've overcome most of that, and so it's now time to proceed.
[01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:10.333]  But as this massive attack illustrates, there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say.
[01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:14.573]  But I'm honored to have this conversation.
[01:42:14.593 --> 01:42:16.634]  I want to emphasize it's a conversation.
[01:42:18.183 --> 01:42:24.568]  And it's really intended to just get, get a feel for what Donald Trump is just like in a conversation.
[01:42:24.588 --> 01:42:30.273]  Um, so it's hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don't hear them talk in a normal way.
[01:42:30.913 --> 01:42:37.198]  And when, you know, when this, when there's an adversarial interview, like no one's themselves in adversarial interview.
[01:42:37.799 --> 01:42:45.805]  Um, so for, and this is really aimed at, uh, kind of open-minded independent voters who, um,
[01:42:47.176 --> 01:42:48.176]  They're just trying to make up their mind.
[01:42:51.777 --> 01:42:56.699]  So you can understand, like, what is it just like to have a conversation?
[01:42:56.739 --> 01:43:03.021]  So, Donald, great to speak.
[01:43:03.681 --> 01:43:05.662]  We had a great conversation yesterday.
[01:43:05.682 --> 01:43:10.863]  As you mentioned yesterday, if we could just record that conversation and post it, it would have been excellent.
[01:43:11.944 --> 01:43:13.324]  I hope we can have something like that today.
[01:43:14.898 --> 01:43:15.839]  Well, I think we will.
[01:43:15.939 --> 01:43:16.999]  I'm pretty sure we will.
[01:43:17.079 --> 01:43:23.342]  And congratulations, because I see you broke every record in the book with so many millions of people.
[01:43:23.382 --> 01:43:24.063]  And that's an honor.
[01:43:24.443 --> 01:43:25.604]  We view that as an honor.
[01:43:26.584 --> 01:43:29.506]  And then you do want silencing of certain voices.
[01:43:30.126 --> 01:43:35.849]  Usually those are voices that have something to say that are constructive, oftentimes constructive.
[01:43:36.489 --> 01:43:38.670]  And so we have to consider it an honor.
[01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:42.192]  But congratulations on breaking every record in the book tonight.
[01:43:42.472 --> 01:43:42.952]  That's great.
[01:43:43.513 --> 01:43:43.953]  Well, thank you.
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:54.787]  Um, well, maybe, uh, we could start off with, um, I mean, the assassination attempt, uh, which, uh, was an incredible thing.
[01:43:54.827 --> 01:44:01.991]  And I have to say that, uh, you know, your actions after that assassination attempt were inspiring.
[01:44:02.651 --> 01:44:10.436]  Um, you know, you, instead of shying away from things, instead of ducking down, um, you were pumping your fist in there and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[01:44:10.456 --> 01:44:12.798]  And I think that's, I mean,
[01:44:13.953 --> 01:44:22.358]  You know, the President of the United States represents America, and I think that is, that is America, that is strength under fire.
[01:44:23.098 --> 01:44:42.328]  And so, that's, you know, a big, you know, part of the reason why I was excited to endorse you as the President of the United States, for having another term here, is that was just incredibly inspiring, but, I mean, what was it like for you?
[01:44:44.093 --> 01:44:49.155]  Not pleasant.
[01:44:50.796 --> 01:44:52.576]  I didn't know I had that much blood.
[01:44:52.937 --> 01:45:00.219]  The doctors later told me that the ear is a place that is a very bloody place if you're going to get hit.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:10.804]  But in this case, it was probably the best alternative you could even think about because it went at the right angle and, you know, it was a hard hit.
[01:45:10.944 --> 01:45:11.424]  It was very
[01:45:12.725 --> 01:45:15.006]  I guess you would say surreal, but it wasn't surreal.
[01:45:15.046 --> 01:45:23.991]  You know, I was telling somebody you have instances like this or like a lot less than this where you feel it's a surreal situation.
[01:45:24.471 --> 01:45:25.591]  And I never felt that way.
[01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:29.273]  I knew immediately that it was a bullet.
[01:45:29.713 --> 01:45:32.655]  I knew immediately that it was at the ear.
[01:45:32.675 --> 01:45:32.755]  Yeah.
[01:45:33.895 --> 01:45:36.677]  And because it, you know, it hit very hard, but hit the ear.
[01:45:37.917 --> 01:45:39.398]  And I also heard people
[01:45:40.433 --> 01:45:46.574]  Shout bullets, bullets, you know, get down, get down because I, you know, I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly.
[01:45:46.634 --> 01:45:49.775]  And we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down.
[01:45:49.815 --> 01:45:50.855]  So I'm glad I went down.
[01:45:51.595 --> 01:45:55.176]  The bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of the shooter.
[01:45:55.196 --> 01:46:01.677]  And so it hit, it hit me at an angle that was, uh, far less destructive than any other angle.
[01:46:01.717 --> 01:46:05.337]  So that was the miracle that was for those people that don't believe in God.
[01:46:05.417 --> 01:46:08.678]  I think we got to all start thinking about that.
[01:46:08.718 --> 01:46:09.238]  You have to, uh,
[01:46:10.302 --> 01:46:11.902]  You know, I'm a believer.
[01:46:11.963 --> 01:46:13.563]  Now I'm more of a believer, I think.
[01:46:13.643 --> 01:46:14.943]  And a lot of people have said that to me.
[01:46:14.963 --> 01:46:17.024]  A lot of great people have said that to me, actually.
[01:46:17.684 --> 01:46:22.126]  But it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle.
[01:46:22.966 --> 01:46:28.948]  And all because I put down a chart on immigration that showed that the numbers were so great.
[01:46:29.468 --> 01:46:30.808]  I love that chart even more now.
[01:46:30.828 --> 01:46:32.409]  I mean, maybe it's a sign.
[01:46:32.449 --> 01:46:33.409]  Maybe that's a sign.
[01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:35.970]  It's an immigration sign.
[01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:39.651]  You highlighted a serious issue at that moment.
[01:46:41.686 --> 01:46:51.569]  The amazing thing is that the sign, I said, bring down that sign on immigration.
[01:46:51.689 --> 01:46:56.230]  And it was literally about an eighth of a second where it would be good.
[01:46:56.370 --> 01:47:00.371]  And after that, it was going to be a disaster no matter which way you were facing.
[01:47:00.891 --> 01:47:01.791]  But it just had that
[01:47:02.509 --> 01:47:06.590]  That perfect angle, which was exactly at this shooter.
[01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:08.171]  Very sad situation.
[01:47:08.751 --> 01:47:09.991]  Such a sad situation.
[01:47:10.131 --> 01:47:17.474]  As you know, we lost somebody that was great, Corey, a firefighter, a great gentleman, a great, a great Trumper.
[01:47:18.194 --> 01:47:22.535]  He was just a fantastic family and a fantastic man.
[01:47:22.635 --> 01:47:28.677]  And a friend of mine came up, Elon, and said, I'd like to give the family some kind of help.
[01:47:29.653 --> 01:47:29.993]  Yeah.
[01:47:30.013 --> 01:47:30.113]  Yeah.
[01:48:00.345 --> 01:48:00.845]  Incredible.
[01:48:00.885 --> 01:48:06.428]  They saved the two and they were really hit tough, both of them equally.
[01:48:07.168 --> 01:48:12.290]  Uh, and we thought, my first question was cause I heard bullets flying over me.
[01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:13.530]  I said, how many people were killed?
[01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:18.913]  Cause we had a massive crowd there, a tremendous thousands and thousands of people.
[01:48:18.953 --> 01:48:19.873]  And there was no land.
[01:48:19.933 --> 01:48:21.334]  I mean, it was just, it was all people.
[01:48:21.354 --> 01:48:23.935]  So I said, how many people have been killed?
[01:48:23.995 --> 01:48:26.716]  Because I knew there were other shots being fired.
[01:48:27.056 --> 01:48:29.257]  And they said, uh, we don't know yet.
[01:48:29.687 --> 01:48:31.188]  But some people have been badly hurt.
[01:48:32.208 --> 01:48:42.712]  And I have to give the Secret Service sniper, they call him, or sharpshooter, but sniper, because he didn't know there was a problem.
[01:48:43.573 --> 01:48:46.634]  He's been, he's an extraordinary shot, obviously.
[01:48:46.814 --> 01:48:47.914]  And he didn't know there was a problem.
[01:48:47.934 --> 01:48:50.315]  And he was able to pick and roll out within five seconds.
[01:48:51.015 --> 01:48:55.397]  And he used one bullet from very far away, I guess, probably about 400 yards.
[01:48:55.937 --> 01:48:56.578]  The shooter was 130.
[01:48:57.912 --> 01:49:02.535]  But he was on the opposite side of the field and the podium.
[01:49:03.595 --> 01:49:11.760]  And he saw the smoke and the flame from the gun, immediately recognized it, and immediately took a shot.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:15.742]  And it was one perfect shot from very far away.
[01:49:15.762 --> 01:49:20.764]  And if he didn't do that, Elon, a lot more people could have been badly hurt and killed.
[01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:30.234]  So I have to take my hat off to him, because that's also surreal.
[01:49:30.254 --> 01:49:35.359]  You know, he's been with them for 23 years, and he's never had anything like this.
[01:49:36.119 --> 01:49:40.523]  And all of a sudden he has to act, and it's a very tough thing to act and to be shooting somebody.
[01:49:41.064 --> 01:49:45.588]  But he saw the gun, saw the smoke, saw the flame from the gun.
[01:49:46.388 --> 01:49:47.208]  Very far away.
[01:49:47.568 --> 01:49:48.769]  Obviously, he has very good eyes.
[01:49:48.829 --> 01:49:51.510]  He's got very good vision, which I assume you have to have.
[01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:53.251]  I mean, look how close the shooter was.
[01:49:53.291 --> 01:49:54.671]  Go back to that video from TV viewers.
[01:49:54.971 --> 01:49:55.812]  He's right frickin' there!
[01:49:55.832 --> 01:49:56.412]  Look at that!
[01:49:56.472 --> 01:49:59.353]  If that didn't happen, because the shooter had a lot of bullets.
[01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:01.914]  He had a lot of cartridges up there with him.
[01:50:09.713 --> 01:50:13.435]  And again, if you want a clear feed of Trump talking, go to X and do it.
[01:50:13.455 --> 01:50:17.136]  You're going to get us occasional comments here with video added at Real Alex Jones.
[01:50:17.196 --> 01:50:18.277]  So share the link if you want.
[01:50:18.777 --> 01:50:21.258]  Donald Trump interview with Elon Musk with video.
[01:50:21.358 --> 01:50:22.339]  Retweet that, folks.
[01:50:22.419 --> 01:50:28.182]  But that does seem to be, I mean, some pretty significant failings elsewhere in the system.
[01:50:28.202 --> 01:50:32.443]  Like, there's just no way that... Like, how on earth does a shooter get on a roof 130 yards away?
[01:50:32.463 --> 01:50:32.684]  That seems...
[01:50:36.215 --> 01:50:36.695]  Crazy.
[01:50:36.976 --> 01:50:41.279]  I think most people are wondering how on earth could such a thing happen.
[01:50:41.459 --> 01:50:42.840]  Well, you know, I view it as two ways.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:44.641]  There should have been nobody on the roof.
[01:50:45.182 --> 01:50:48.704]  There were people because there were so many tens of thousands of people there.
[01:50:49.064 --> 01:50:51.146]  There were people that were seeing him.
[01:50:52.067 --> 01:50:57.731]  And there was one woman with a red shirt and Trump all over it.
[01:50:57.791 --> 01:50:59.092]  And she's screaming.
[01:51:00.063 --> 01:51:01.244]  That guy's got a gun.
[01:51:01.264 --> 01:51:02.625]  You know, you saw it, probably.
[01:51:02.645 --> 01:51:05.126]  There's a guy up there with a gun.
[01:51:05.627 --> 01:51:20.256]  It's like, I'm just, I guess, I mean, for my part, and I think probably many members of the public are wondering how the heck are, you know, basically people wondering by pointing out there's a guy on the roof with a gun.
[01:51:20.316 --> 01:51:20.896]  Yeah.
[01:51:22.117 --> 01:51:26.140]  They're seeing it, but somehow it's not being addressed.
[01:51:27.778 --> 01:51:28.579]  That does seem crazy.
[01:51:28.619 --> 01:51:30.119]  Well, they're going to learn from this.
[01:51:30.259 --> 01:51:41.405]  The communication between the local police, who sort of had an idea, and then ultimately a man lifted himself up to the roof, could barely do it because, you know, he was pulling himself up.
[01:51:42.485 --> 01:51:44.806]  And he saw the man with the gun.
[01:51:45.807 --> 01:51:47.668]  The man with the gun pointed the gun at him.
[01:51:47.688 --> 01:51:50.489]  He thought he was probably going to get shot.
[01:51:51.089 --> 01:51:53.030]  But, you know, he was like pulling himself up.
[01:51:53.911 --> 01:51:56.632]  And because of that, he couldn't get to his gun.
[01:51:57.441 --> 01:52:03.662]  And he fell down, actually very badly hurt his leg, his ankle, I hear, very badly.
[01:52:04.022 --> 01:52:04.903]  But he fell down.
[01:52:05.383 --> 01:52:10.044]  And he did, you know, from what I understand, he did say there's a guy up there with a gun.
[01:52:11.184 --> 01:52:14.485]  And the shooting started very quickly after that.
[01:52:14.525 --> 01:52:18.665]  I think it forced the shooter to go maybe quicker.
[01:52:18.685 --> 01:52:19.766]  You know, you're supposed to be very quick.
[01:52:19.786 --> 01:52:20.146]  Exactly.
[01:52:20.966 --> 01:52:23.006]  The cop doing that one thing got him off target.
[01:52:23.026 --> 01:52:25.847]  Brian and Eric, they can't believe what happened.
[01:52:26.343 --> 01:52:32.247]  They said from 130 yards, a bad shot would hit that target almost every time.
[01:52:32.527 --> 01:52:34.848]  They said it's like in golf, sinking a two-foot putt.
[01:52:35.969 --> 01:52:37.770]  Yeah, it's not a tough shot.
[01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:39.351]  No, it's not a long shot.
[01:52:39.851 --> 01:52:42.873]  The Secret Service person had the long shot.
[01:52:42.913 --> 01:52:45.254]  He had a, you know, triple the distance, actually.
[01:52:45.775 --> 01:52:50.278]  So, you know, it was a terrible thing.
[01:52:50.318 --> 01:52:52.799]  Look, it's hard.
[01:52:52.919 --> 01:52:54.820]  I have to say this about the Secret Service.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.801]  When I went down,
[01:52:57.151 --> 01:53:00.174]  And, you know, I went down based on, I think, their screaming.
[01:53:01.034 --> 01:53:03.296]  But other people also, because people saw this happen.
[01:53:03.316 --> 01:53:05.178]  You know, you had so many people.
[01:53:05.298 --> 01:53:07.660]  One of the miracles was that nobody ran.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.364]  I mean, if a gun goes off, the crowd control people showed us this.
[01:53:12.885 --> 01:53:18.930]  When guns go off, and it does happen in stadiums and a soccer match or some kind of a match, everybody flees.
[01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:21.772]  They call it a stampede, like cattle.
[01:53:21.852 --> 01:53:23.714]  And a lot of people get killed with those stampedes.
[01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:26.182]  Trump just said something really curious.
[01:53:26.222 --> 01:53:30.143]  He said that the sniper that took out the shooter had three times the distance.
[01:53:30.243 --> 01:53:33.744]  So I don't know what that's about because the testimony from the
[01:53:46.528 --> 01:53:56.501]  New Director of Secret Service and the FBI Deputy Director was it was the sniper team to the right of Trump if you're looking at the stage.
[01:53:57.591 --> 01:53:57.751]  Yeah.
[01:53:57.791 --> 01:53:58.832]  Well, I mean, Trump's not perfect.
[01:53:58.852 --> 01:54:00.533]  He doesn't know all the details.
[01:54:19.099 --> 01:54:20.359]  You didn't have anybody flee.
[01:54:20.419 --> 01:54:22.020]  You didn't have anybody stampede.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:22.660]  Nobody.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:24.180]  And there were some people behind me.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:25.180]  Let's see how Trump's praising.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.240]  Secret Service in the crowd.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:26.560]  Great.
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:26.980]  Move on.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.182]  What are you going to do to Ronald Roe, the head of the Secret Service, who actually directed this and lied to Congress?
[01:54:34.722 --> 01:54:39.403]  So I was down, but the Secret Service guys, there were bullets flying right over my head.
[01:54:39.423 --> 01:54:40.623]  You could hear them go whizzing.
[01:54:40.723 --> 01:54:46.544]  And these guys came jumping on top of me and a young lady.
[01:54:46.564 --> 01:54:47.804]  Yeah, they weren't part of the standout.
[01:54:48.436 --> 01:54:52.660]  I mean, looking at the aerial views, that building would be like the number one spot for a sniper.
[01:55:12.193 --> 01:55:17.334]  If you were to pick, like, what is the favorite, what if you, so if the goal is to assassinate, what's your favorite spot?
[01:55:17.394 --> 01:55:17.894]  That building.
[01:55:18.054 --> 01:55:18.574]  You're right.
[01:55:18.594 --> 01:55:19.574]  That building would be number one.
[01:55:19.594 --> 01:55:20.474]  That would have been the spot.
[01:55:20.514 --> 01:55:22.395]  It's like you couldn't, you couldn't ask for a better location.
[01:55:22.415 --> 01:55:24.155]  It's like, no, that would have been the spot.
[01:55:24.555 --> 01:55:32.917]  You know what people think is when the local policeman, who, by the way, you know, he really, uh, he did what he was supposed to do.
[01:55:32.957 --> 01:55:34.237]  He couldn't hold on any longer.
[01:55:34.257 --> 01:55:39.738]  And then when he got his head, just peeking above this guy standing there with a gun at his head.
[01:55:41.598 --> 01:55:45.201]  When he fell down again, hurt his ankle very badly, but he was making the calls.
[01:55:45.701 --> 01:55:48.323]  But what happened is the firing took place very soon.
[01:55:48.744 --> 01:55:54.608]  So what I think is that this guy ran to his site, which he had all planned out with the gun.
[01:55:55.389 --> 01:56:03.295]  Uh, he ran to the site and he started shooting fast and maybe that's why he, uh, well, he sort of missed.
[01:56:03.476 --> 01:56:10.621]  I mean, you know, he, uh, it could have been, um, could have been a much bigger problem.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.001]  But he totally would have hit if you hadn't turned your head.
[01:56:14.421 --> 01:56:18.302]  It was a very near thing.
[01:56:18.382 --> 01:56:19.122]  It was a miracle.
[01:56:19.202 --> 01:56:23.684]  If I hadn't turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now, as much as I like you.
[01:56:23.704 --> 01:56:24.264]  Exactly.
[01:56:24.564 --> 01:56:27.805]  I would not be talking to you.
[01:56:27.885 --> 01:56:30.566]  Folks, let me tell you something.
[01:56:30.586 --> 01:56:31.586]  A news update here.
[01:56:31.606 --> 01:56:33.266]  This is definitely a DDoS attack.
[01:56:33.867 --> 01:56:40.589]  Many of the video streams, overhead shot please for TV viewers, many of the video streams on X are dead or being taken down.
[01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:41.369]  So it's not just
[01:56:42.987 --> 01:56:43.888]  Overhead shot right here, guys.
[01:56:44.829 --> 01:56:48.413]  It's not just the spaces they're taking down.
[01:56:48.873 --> 01:56:49.895]  Broadcast not available.
[01:56:49.915 --> 01:56:51.556]  We checked on a bunch of phones and computers.
[01:56:52.117 --> 01:56:53.418]  A lot of the feeds are down.
[01:56:53.438 --> 01:56:56.822]  They have the capacity for billions of viewers.
[01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:58.844]  So this is definitely a shutdown.
[01:56:59.225 --> 01:57:00.826]  And the EU threatened to shut them down.
[01:57:01.287 --> 01:57:02.408]  They are so upset, guys.
[01:57:02.428 --> 01:57:03.710]  A quick comment before we go back to this.
[01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:16.819]  Yeah I would say either, I mean probably the DDoS attacks and then also maybe X just decided we're going to streamline every server we can into this so that the space can keep going.
[01:57:18.482 --> 01:57:24.743]  Let's see what the UK government, the EU, does to Musk in response to this, because they've already tried to sue him.
[01:57:24.883 --> 01:57:26.084]  They've already threatened to sue him.
[01:57:26.104 --> 01:57:27.704]  They've already threatened all this other stuff.
[01:57:27.864 --> 01:57:30.524]  Think of the balls, the arrogance.
[01:57:30.604 --> 01:57:31.485]  Better not have Trump on.
[01:57:31.665 --> 01:57:37.466]  And the Democrat Party right now, the Biden administration, they've got things hanging over Elon Musk that they're trying to punish him with.
[01:57:38.186 --> 01:57:39.506]  All sorts of investigations.
[01:57:39.526 --> 01:57:42.767]  These same Democrat lawyers are suing Elon Musk.
[01:57:43.687 --> 01:57:45.088]  Well, let's see what our computers show.
[01:57:45.128 --> 01:57:47.390]  My phone says our feed's dead at Real Alex Jones.
[01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:50.672]  What do you see on your computer, Harrison Smith?
[01:57:50.752 --> 01:57:53.253]  And let's put it up on screen there.
[01:57:54.254 --> 01:57:56.896]  And again, if you want just the Trump feed, you can go find it on Xbox.
[01:57:56.916 --> 01:57:57.936]  We're doing an analysis here.
[01:58:00.358 --> 01:58:02.639]  Okay, so we're able to get the feed in there.
[01:58:03.079 --> 01:58:05.561]  Breaking Elon Trump interview under hack attack.
[01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:07.522]  See and hear on censored feed.
[01:58:07.542 --> 01:58:08.463]  All right, let's go back to him then.
[01:58:10.752 --> 01:58:11.693]  They wanted a stretcher.
[01:58:11.733 --> 01:58:12.773]  I didn't like the stretcher.
[01:58:12.853 --> 01:58:15.675]  And I knew I was hit in the ear, but I knew I wasn't hit anywhere else.
[01:58:15.715 --> 01:58:17.316]  They felt I was hit someplace else.
[01:58:17.817 --> 01:58:19.257]  It was such a lot of blood.
[01:58:19.938 --> 01:58:21.699]  And they were sure that I was hit someplace else.
[01:58:21.899 --> 01:58:25.982]  And they were saying, sir, you were hit more than the ear.
[01:58:26.022 --> 01:58:27.583]  I said, nope, I was hit in the ear.
[01:58:27.603 --> 01:58:28.243]  I want to get up.
[01:58:28.903 --> 01:58:29.524]  Let me get up.
[01:58:29.604 --> 01:58:30.905]  And so I got up.
[01:58:32.245 --> 01:58:34.127]  And the crowd didn't know what to think.
[01:58:34.167 --> 01:58:36.928]  I mean, this was so, so many people.
[01:58:36.988 --> 01:58:38.649]  And you could see they were confused.
[01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:39.470]  They didn't know what to think.
[01:58:40.336 --> 01:58:41.817]  And Musk won't back down?
[01:58:41.857 --> 01:58:42.737]  Trump won't back down?
[01:59:08.524 --> 01:59:12.133]  That's gotta upset these control freaks.
[01:59:12.213 --> 01:59:14.138]  Well, you know, and that's why, to me, and look...
[01:59:19.168 --> 01:59:20.929]  I'm all for constructive criticism.
[01:59:21.089 --> 01:59:22.389]  I'm all for fair criticism.
[01:59:22.569 --> 01:59:23.929]  I'm not claiming Musk is perfect.
[01:59:24.049 --> 01:59:25.310]  I'm not claiming Trump is perfect.
[01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:29.991]  I'm simply saying... You can't argue with the devastating results of the enemy.
[01:59:30.171 --> 01:59:38.353]  But Alex, you more than me, because you mentioned this earlier, you've been at this three decades, I've been at this nearly a decade now, eight years at Infowars, a couple years doing politics before that.
[01:59:38.793 --> 01:59:42.394]  It's like we've been sitting here ramming our head against this beast.
[01:59:42.834 --> 01:59:43.294]  Ramming.
[01:59:43.574 --> 01:59:44.054]  Ramming.
[01:59:44.315 --> 01:59:44.775]  Ramming.
[01:59:45.115 --> 01:59:45.515]  Ramming.
[01:59:46.135 --> 01:59:49.660]  And so it's like, finally these big heads are coming up.
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:50.801]  You're going to prison for it.
[01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:52.383]  And then you see real results.
[01:59:52.443 --> 01:59:54.305]  All these armchair quarterbacks go, oh, it's fake.
[01:59:54.606 --> 01:59:56.788]  No, folks, you judges reap our fruits.
[01:59:56.949 --> 01:59:57.790]  This ain't fake.
[01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:59.892]  You can say Musk wants to take over from them.
[01:59:59.932 --> 02:00:00.593]  Maybe that's true.
[02:00:00.894 --> 02:00:02.516]  But he's really giving a run for their money.
[02:00:02.536 --> 02:00:03.517]  Harrison, we'll go back to Trump.
[02:00:03.757 --> 02:00:06.740]  Yeah, well, once you let the cat out of the bag, you can't put it back in.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:08.783]  Like, you can't fake giving people information.
[02:00:08.843 --> 02:00:11.185]  When you give them the information, they have it from then on.
[02:00:11.245 --> 02:00:11.726]  It's real?
[02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:13.267]  Yeah, it can't be a trick.
[02:00:13.588 --> 02:00:16.251]  You tell somebody something that's true, they know it, it's in their head from then on.
[02:00:16.271 --> 02:00:17.832]  You're getting millions of views every day on your stuff.
[02:00:17.872 --> 02:00:19.114]  Is anybody suppressing you?
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.101]  Well, not that I know of.
[02:00:21.161 --> 02:00:22.142]  Although, I don't know.
[02:00:22.162 --> 02:00:25.344]  Elon, there's a little bit of shadow banning going on.
[02:00:25.364 --> 02:00:25.745]  We know that.
[02:00:25.765 --> 02:00:27.346]  Well, that's groups that foul against you.
[02:00:27.366 --> 02:00:28.687]  But so, so, so much better.
[02:00:28.747 --> 02:00:30.128]  Are you getting 20 times the reach you had before?
[02:00:30.148 --> 02:00:31.289]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:31.389 --> 02:00:32.229]  I have an account now.
[02:00:32.309 --> 02:00:33.550]  So, you know, that alone.
[02:00:33.570 --> 02:00:35.291]  Well, I see your videos with a million views all the time.
[02:00:36.092 --> 02:00:38.194]  But I'm just sitting at this wall banging my head.
[02:00:38.274 --> 02:00:39.174]  Alex banging his head.
[02:00:39.214 --> 02:00:40.075]  Infowars banging their head.
[02:00:40.295 --> 02:00:41.276]  And now Trump banging his head.
[02:00:41.356 --> 02:00:42.037]  Musk banging his head.
[02:00:42.257 --> 02:00:44.398]  And then somebody's like, hey, what are you doing here?
[02:00:44.478 --> 02:00:46.260]  You're not supposed to be banging your head with us.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:46.700]  I'm like, what?
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:48.702]  We got to tear down this freaking wall, man.
[02:00:48.802 --> 02:00:49.862]  Bang your head with us.
[02:00:49.943 --> 02:00:50.903]  Quit looking around.
[02:00:50.923 --> 02:00:52.444]  Yeah, we're attacking an enemy gate.
[02:00:53.265 --> 02:00:54.966]  And Musk just blew giant holes through it.
[02:00:54.986 --> 02:00:55.587]  They're like, bitching.
[02:00:55.627 --> 02:00:57.648]  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[02:00:57.668 --> 02:00:58.589]  Here, let's go back to it.
[02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:59.550]  Here we go.
[02:01:00.775 --> 02:01:02.796]  And we're going to go back in October.
[02:01:02.836 --> 02:01:06.297]  We're all set up and we're, the people are fantastic in Butler.
[02:01:06.337 --> 02:01:08.177]  It's a big, it's a great area.
[02:01:08.477 --> 02:01:08.757]  Great.
[02:01:08.857 --> 02:01:10.118]  These are incredible people.
[02:01:11.178 --> 02:01:20.400]  Uh, like the three that in the case of Corey killed and the other two, the, the families are, I got to know him a little bit and the families are great, but we're going back to Butler.
[02:01:21.381 --> 02:01:25.702]  And, uh, I think I'll probably start by saying, uh, as I was saying,
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.361]  You know, prior to being so horribly interrupted.
[02:01:31.101 --> 02:01:34.122]  Yeah, so rudely interrupted by an assassination.
[02:01:34.222 --> 02:01:38.603]  By the way, a Trump office in Virginia has been broken into.
[02:01:38.643 --> 02:01:39.643]  We'll put that on screen.
[02:01:39.663 --> 02:01:42.203]  We'll be giving you video as this unfolds.
[02:01:42.243 --> 02:01:43.104]  Let's continue back.
[02:01:43.204 --> 02:01:46.024]  Illegal immigration numbers, meaning stopping.
[02:01:46.945 --> 02:01:47.705]  It was at the lowest.
[02:01:47.725 --> 02:01:48.505]  You've seen the chart.
[02:01:48.565 --> 02:01:50.225]  It's become quite a famous chart.
[02:01:50.245 --> 02:01:53.486]  But that was the lowest point ever recorded.
[02:01:54.013 --> 02:01:57.775]  It was a really, I mean, I was very proud of those numbers.
[02:01:57.815 --> 02:02:01.797]  And then you see what happened with these people, Kamala and Joe.
[02:02:02.438 --> 02:02:03.398]  You see what happened.
[02:02:04.098 --> 02:02:05.059]  They just let it go.
[02:02:05.079 --> 02:02:08.020]  I had Remain in Mexico policies.
[02:02:08.041 --> 02:02:10.402]  I had all these different policies that were so good.
[02:02:11.482 --> 02:02:13.344]  He's got to hit her on stealing his tips thing.
[02:02:13.364 --> 02:02:15.606]  Because again, she passed the law.
[02:02:15.686 --> 02:02:20.009]  She wrote the law to put 86,000 IRS agents on people's tips.
[02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:23.432]  And then she claims she wants to give them their tips.
[02:02:23.512 --> 02:02:25.353]  You can't make it up!
[02:02:25.433 --> 02:02:26.874]  She's running on strong borders now.
[02:02:32.777 --> 02:02:38.823]  You can say what you want about Trump, but if he says something, he's gonna do it or try it.
[02:02:38.863 --> 02:02:40.325]  Like, you ain't getting bullshit with Trump.
[02:02:40.345 --> 02:02:40.485]  Sure.
[02:02:51.758 --> 02:02:54.282]  In this case I'm glad I used it, I can tell you that.
[02:03:08.553 --> 02:03:10.895]  Elon Musk interview uncensored with Alex Jones.
[02:03:11.455 --> 02:03:13.356]  So just repost it right now and we'll get 5 million.
[02:03:13.377 --> 02:03:13.897]  Let's just do that.
[02:03:13.977 --> 02:03:15.738]  A little added juiciness on top.
[02:03:15.958 --> 02:03:19.101]  By the way, they just bring up the open borders with the diseases.
[02:03:19.301 --> 02:03:20.482]  This is what's so frustrating.
[02:03:20.502 --> 02:03:24.104]  It's like, can we live in a land of any logic and common sense?
[02:03:24.144 --> 02:03:25.425]  Just like a little bit.
[02:03:25.485 --> 02:03:27.947]  They wouldn't even let you go to the grocery store if you had a cough.
[02:03:28.948 --> 02:03:31.469]  If you had a sniffle, you couldn't even leave your house.
[02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:33.831]  Oh, you got the bubonic plague?
[02:03:33.851 --> 02:03:34.592]  Yeah, come on in.
[02:03:34.632 --> 02:03:36.013]  We'll send you right into downtown Chicago.
[02:03:36.775 --> 02:03:37.495]  Go back to Trump.
[02:03:37.515 --> 02:03:38.716]  We're going to shut up for five minutes.
[02:03:38.756 --> 02:03:39.256]  Here it is.
[02:03:39.397 --> 02:03:40.657]  They have to come in legally.
[02:03:41.077 --> 02:03:42.118]  They have to be checked.
[02:03:42.158 --> 02:03:42.318]  Yeah.
[02:03:42.918 --> 02:03:45.920]  Because look, Kamala was the border zone.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:46.861]  Now she's denying it.
[02:03:47.041 --> 02:03:51.543]  Everything that I do, she's saying she was strong on the border.
[02:03:51.623 --> 02:03:52.564]  We're going to be strong.
[02:03:52.724 --> 02:03:54.145]  Well, she doesn't have to say it.
[02:03:54.185 --> 02:03:55.345]  She could close it up right now.
[02:03:55.386 --> 02:03:57.026]  They could do things right now.
[02:03:57.327 --> 02:03:57.887]  It's horrible.
[02:03:59.488 --> 02:04:00.468]  No tax on tips.
[02:04:00.628 --> 02:04:03.830]  And all of a sudden she's making a speech and saying there will be no tax on tips.
[02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:04.871]  I said that months ago.
[02:04:05.675 --> 02:04:07.496]  And by the way, they had just the opposite.
[02:04:07.676 --> 02:04:19.603]  You know, they had not only tax on tips, but they hired 88,000 IRS agents and many of them were assigned to go get waitresses and caddies and all of this on tips.
[02:04:19.863 --> 02:04:20.824]  They have a policy.
[02:04:20.864 --> 02:04:25.166]  They had a policy that we're really going to go after you and we're really harassing you.
[02:04:25.186 --> 02:04:26.427]  He's doing it right now.
[02:04:26.467 --> 02:04:32.090]  And then all of a sudden for politics, he says, you know, she comes out with, with what I said, which I think is terrible.
[02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:33.831]  And I think it's also hitting them very hard.
[02:04:34.497 --> 02:04:35.539]  These people are fake.
[02:04:35.819 --> 02:04:37.982]  Now they're also saying they did a good job on the border.
[02:04:38.002 --> 02:04:39.904]  We had the worst numbers in the history of the world.
[02:04:40.004 --> 02:04:41.086]  Not of our country.
[02:04:41.506 --> 02:04:45.892]  There's never been a country in history that has had a catastrophe like this.
[02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:54.053]  I believe, and I think you believe this, you know, you hear 12 million, 13... I believe it's over 20 million people came into our country.
[02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:59.818]  Many coming from jails, from prisons, from... Yeah, they've dumped their worst.
[02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:02.601]  Notice I can finish Trump's sentences because we're not lying.
[02:05:02.621 --> 02:05:03.902]  We have the data.
[02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:05.764]  How does he finish my sentences?
[02:05:06.325 --> 02:05:07.225]  How do I finish his?
[02:05:07.245 --> 02:05:09.067]  Because we are living in reality.
[02:05:09.087 --> 02:05:10.689]  They're coming from all over the world.
[02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:11.870]  They're coming from Asia.
[02:05:12.529 --> 02:05:14.530]  They're coming from the Middle East.
[02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:22.692]  They're coming from countries that are stupidly and horribly bombing Israel, October 7th.
[02:05:23.112 --> 02:05:24.613]  They're coming from all over the world.
[02:05:25.313 --> 02:05:29.494]  And you know, you look at, it's so sad, October 7th, because it should have never happened.
[02:05:29.894 --> 02:05:31.955]  It's so sad when you look at Ukraine.
[02:05:32.175 --> 02:05:33.276]  It should have never happened.
[02:05:33.896 --> 02:05:35.396]  We have a defective government.
[02:05:35.416 --> 02:05:36.737]  These are defective people.
[02:05:37.237 --> 02:05:38.797]  And they're not people that should be running it.
[02:05:39.117 --> 02:05:40.858]  But where you see it the best is the border.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.821]  By the way, we just went up by another 100,000 viewers on 1x feed.
[02:05:44.841 --> 02:05:47.142]  We had all our x feeds together, about 2 million.
[02:05:47.202 --> 02:05:48.603]  InfoWars feed, it's about 3 million.
[02:05:49.123 --> 02:05:56.646]  Everybody, retweet, repost, live feed of Trump-Elon Musk censored on X. Retweet it right now.
[02:05:56.666 --> 02:05:59.027]  Retweet the live feed at Real Alex Jones right now.
[02:05:59.707 --> 02:06:01.588]  Hell, we can put it up to 20 million if you do it.
[02:06:01.648 --> 02:06:02.988]  The enemy hates it.
[02:06:03.068 --> 02:06:03.989]  Exercise your muscles.
[02:06:04.049 --> 02:06:04.829]  Annihilate the enemy.
[02:06:04.869 --> 02:06:06.009]  Attack, attack, attack.
[02:06:06.309 --> 02:06:07.610]  InfoWars, attack, attack.
[02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:09.651]  Fire at will!
[02:06:09.671 --> 02:06:10.991]  This ain't a game.
[02:06:11.031 --> 02:06:13.393]  I need to hold in position and stay on air to lose.
[02:06:13.413 --> 02:06:15.273]  We're going to win, people.
[02:06:15.473 --> 02:06:19.215]  And secure elections.
[02:06:21.076 --> 02:06:22.177]  Absolutely secure elections.
[02:06:22.597 --> 02:06:28.740]  And so it's just essential to have a real border or we can't function as a country.
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.162]  And our central services are being overwhelmed in a lot of cities.
[02:06:34.506 --> 02:06:38.589]  Walsh just wants a base to run a star base.
[02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:39.890]  He just wants a secure country.
[02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:41.531]  He already got run out of South Africa.
[02:06:41.571 --> 02:06:42.591]  That's his leg up on us.
[02:06:42.611 --> 02:06:44.453]  He's already been through this.
[02:06:44.513 --> 02:06:46.534]  He's an immigrant.
[02:06:46.554 --> 02:06:52.578]  He's an African American.
[02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:54.479]  One way to think of it is, who do you want on your team?
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.201]  Who do you want on Team America?
[02:06:58.762 --> 02:07:02.144]  And I think we want to just say, okay, we want to
[02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:03.462]  We're good to go.
[02:07:20.245 --> 02:07:25.069]  Most of the illegal immigrants actually are good, hard-working people.
[02:07:25.089 --> 02:07:25.229]  Exactly.
[02:07:25.249 --> 02:07:25.789]  Team Humanity.
[02:07:25.809 --> 02:07:26.450]  We're not against them.
[02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:28.091]  But they're being used as a weapon.
[02:07:28.311 --> 02:07:38.099]  And you just have this sort of adverse selection process where, you know, if somebody's... They're bringing them in and brainwashing them.
[02:07:38.119 --> 02:07:43.683]  If somebody's like a... We can bring them in, but we've got to induct them into America.
[02:07:45.685 --> 02:07:48.206]  I don't understand what's taking them so long to get here.
[02:07:49.707 --> 02:07:51.768]  Because we're in such a target-rich environment.
[02:07:53.088 --> 02:07:55.869]  I mean... They're waiting for Democrat orders to launch the terror attacks.
[02:07:55.889 --> 02:08:06.534]  More people who have a career in, you know, bad things coming here sooner because it's, I mean, it's a piece of cake to go rob, you know, houses in L.A.
[02:08:06.594 --> 02:08:07.074]  or New York.
[02:08:07.094 --> 02:08:07.855]  Well, they already are here.
[02:08:07.895 --> 02:08:09.215]  The news isn't reporting it.
[02:08:09.455 --> 02:08:12.196]  There's organized gang crime happening across the country.
[02:08:12.536 --> 02:08:13.537]  In a lot of places in America,
[02:08:14.718 --> 02:08:19.460]  If you try to stop the person who's robbing you, you'll be arrested.
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:20.920]  It's right.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.121]  I mean, what's happening with crime?
[02:08:23.521 --> 02:08:26.462]  And our police are so good, but they're not allowed to do their job.
[02:08:26.782 --> 02:08:30.323]  But I have to tell you, Elon, I hate to say it because it's such a downer to say it.
[02:08:30.383 --> 02:08:31.143]  I hate to say it.
[02:08:32.063 --> 02:08:32.463]  I hate it.
[02:08:32.623 --> 02:08:35.984]  But you have a lot of people that just shouldn't be.
[02:08:36.084 --> 02:08:37.805]  I think it's a much bigger number than you think.
[02:08:38.205 --> 02:08:39.946]  They're allowing people from their jails.
[02:08:41.658 --> 02:08:45.860]  And if you were running one of these countries, where they're coming from, you would have had all of them.
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:50.182]  As an example, Venezuela, their crime is down 72%.
[02:08:50.242 --> 02:08:52.483]  They're taking their drug dealers.
[02:08:52.523 --> 02:08:53.323]  Because they shipped it here.
[02:08:53.343 --> 02:08:55.004]  They're taking, frankly, their prisoners.
[02:08:55.044 --> 02:08:56.284]  They're emptying out their prisons.
[02:08:56.685 --> 02:09:04.188]  They're taking their criminals, their murderers, their rapists, and they're delivering them into the- That's what Castro did.
[02:09:04.208 --> 02:09:06.229]  Yeah, well, he did, on a much smaller scale.
[02:09:07.222 --> 02:09:08.082]  Much smaller scale.
[02:09:08.323 --> 02:09:11.144]  But this is a massive scale, because this is being done worldwide.
[02:09:11.544 --> 02:09:12.625]  But here's what's happening.
[02:09:13.005 --> 02:09:15.606]  Crime all over the world is down.
[02:09:16.487 --> 02:09:18.528]  And wait until you see the numbers that we have.
[02:09:19.008 --> 02:09:20.649]  You know, this is migrant crime.
[02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:26.912]  This is crime that's going to be... And I saw it today in New York where somebody was... And I'm getting reports on X and Alex Jones.
[02:09:27.132 --> 02:09:29.493]  A lot of folks are trying to tune in and being blocked.
[02:09:29.513 --> 02:09:31.414]  It's because X is under DDoS attack.
[02:09:31.434 --> 02:09:35.056]  So just take this show once it's archived and share it tomorrow.
[02:09:35.076 --> 02:09:36.157]  Don't let the enemy stop you.
[02:09:37.568 --> 02:09:38.829]  They're scared of this for a reason.
[02:09:38.850 --> 02:09:39.931]  What's the old saying?
[02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:41.232]  Nobody knew who said it first.
[02:09:41.252 --> 02:09:44.756]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:09:55.822 --> 02:09:57.524]  And it's horrible what they're doing.
[02:09:57.684 --> 02:10:01.890]  And she's in charge of it because, you know, now she's trying to say she had nothing to do with it.
[02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:08.418]  And she's such a liar because he was called the Bordezar the first day and it was on the headlines of every newspaper.
[02:10:08.458 --> 02:10:09.219]  She's the Bordezar.
[02:10:09.619 --> 02:10:10.700]  And she never even went there.
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:14.245]  She went to one location which had nothing to do with where the problem is.
[02:10:14.625 --> 02:10:19.669]  You know, she went in and out, I guess, because she was getting a lot of pressure, but it had nothing to do with the problem.
[02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:26.595]  But she was the Bordezar, and people can't allow them to get away with their disinformation campaign.
[02:10:26.615 --> 02:10:33.822]  Now she's trying to say that she wasn't really involved, and the whole thing is horrible.
[02:10:34.282 --> 02:10:36.164]  He was totally in charge.
[02:10:36.664 --> 02:10:38.546]  She could have shut the border down without him.
[02:10:38.606 --> 02:10:39.927]  He didn't know what he was doing anyways.
[02:10:40.007 --> 02:10:41.328]  He wouldn't have even known what happened.
[02:10:41.755 --> 02:10:43.957]  You can shut the border down, he wouldn't even know the difference.
[02:10:44.377 --> 02:10:50.042]  But the fact is that she was, borders are, but you don't have to call her that.
[02:10:50.663 --> 02:10:55.727]  The fact is you could just call her, she was in charge of the border, and the border was the worst ever.
[02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.229]  It's simply not working.
[02:10:58.309 --> 02:11:00.651]  No, it's horrible.
[02:11:00.991 --> 02:11:10.079]  Whether it's by, whether it's a question of intention or competence, either way, we don't have a secure border and we have
[02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:14.777]  People streaming over like it looks like a World War Z zombie apocalypse at times.
[02:11:15.217 --> 02:11:19.518]  And, you know, sometimes you got to sort of wonder, like, is it real or not?
[02:11:19.618 --> 02:11:22.259]  So I, you know, cause you see things here, like, is it real?
[02:11:22.279 --> 02:11:27.902]  I, so I went to the border at Eagle Pass and I saw for myself in Texas and I was like, okay, it's real.
[02:11:28.302 --> 02:11:29.362]  I'm like seeing this in real time.
[02:11:29.382 --> 02:11:31.183]  I actually posted the video, like just live.
[02:11:31.203 --> 02:11:36.505]  I just, I just flew there one day and just to see, Hey, is this, is this, is this made up or real?
[02:11:36.545 --> 02:11:39.786]  And I'm just seeing people stream across the border and, um,
[02:11:40.276 --> 02:11:43.559]  And I have to say, you know, at least the people I saw did not look friendly.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:49.605]  You know, so people can look at my video and say, hey, you know, these people look friendly.
[02:11:49.665 --> 02:11:50.886]  I don't look super friendly.
[02:11:50.946 --> 02:11:57.452]  These are people that Elon would not be the same man if he had to walk across the street and look these people in the eye.
[02:11:57.472 --> 02:11:58.553]  These are rough people.
[02:11:58.613 --> 02:12:00.695]  These are really rough people coming across.
[02:12:01.215 --> 02:12:02.276]  And I know rough people.
[02:12:02.837 --> 02:12:04.999]  And these are people that we don't want in our country.
[02:12:05.755 --> 02:12:11.240]  And, you know, the caravans are coming in, and they're putting... And who's doing this is the heads of the countries.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:15.784]  And you would be doing it, and so would I. And everyone would say, oh, what a terrible thing to say.
[02:12:16.264 --> 02:12:22.629]  The fact is, it's brilliant for them because they're taking all of their bad people, really bad people.
[02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:30.716]  And I hate to say this, the reason the numbers are much bigger than you would think is they're also taking their non-productive people.
[02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.378]  Now, these aren't people that will kill you.
[02:12:33.018 --> 02:12:33.799]  We have enough of them.
[02:12:34.505 --> 02:12:36.646]  But these are people that are non-productive.
[02:12:37.446 --> 02:12:38.687]  They are just not productive.
[02:12:38.747 --> 02:12:39.868]  I mean, for whatever reason.
[02:12:39.888 --> 02:12:42.969]  They're not workers or they don't want to work or whatever.
[02:12:43.429 --> 02:12:47.911]  And these countries are getting rid of non-productive people in the caravans in many cases.
[02:12:48.972 --> 02:12:55.395]  And they're also getting rid of their murderers and their drug dealers and the people that are really brutal people.
[02:12:55.595 --> 02:12:59.377]  And they're coming into our country at levels that have never been seen before.
[02:12:59.837 --> 02:13:02.158]  And I saw an ad just before I got on the air.
[02:13:02.498 --> 02:13:03.879]  I'm walking over here.
[02:13:04.474 --> 02:13:10.520]  And I saw an ad by Kamala saying how she is going to provide border security.
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:12.222]  Where has she been for three and a half years?
[02:13:12.262 --> 02:13:15.445]  For three and a half years, we have 20 million people.
[02:13:15.525 --> 02:13:16.966]  It's terrible.
[02:13:17.086 --> 02:13:23.152]  Yeah, I think this, frankly, I think this is a fundamental existential issue for the United States.
[02:13:24.153 --> 02:13:25.835]  And if we have another four more years,
[02:13:26.631 --> 02:13:28.671]  Totally brainwashed by the globalists.
[02:13:28.691 --> 02:13:29.011]  All voting.
[02:13:54.272 --> 02:13:57.895]  The replacement migration wants 650 million in the U.S.
[02:13:57.915 --> 02:13:58.315]  Look it up.
[02:13:58.715 --> 02:13:59.696]  Go to the U.N.
[02:13:59.716 --> 02:14:00.377]  website, folks.
[02:14:00.397 --> 02:14:01.878]  The NAL wants to arrest you if you say it.
[02:14:02.158 --> 02:14:02.779]  Look it up.
[02:14:02.819 --> 02:14:07.562]  Basically, when I went down there, I was like, well, where are people from?
[02:14:07.622 --> 02:14:10.064]  It's like almost no one was from Mexico.
[02:14:12.866 --> 02:14:18.190]  It's just the border with Mexico, but the people coming in... Yeah, Mexicans are totally compatible with the U.S.
[02:14:18.230 --> 02:14:21.833]  compared to people from other parts of the world, let's just be honest.
[02:14:21.853 --> 02:14:24.035]  About four or five percent of the population of Earth
[02:14:24.685 --> 02:14:28.027]  It would only take a few percent of the rest of Earth to overwhelm everything in the U.S.
[02:14:28.047 --> 02:14:29.909]  We're already overwhelmed, Elon.
[02:14:30.029 --> 02:14:30.889]  We're overwhelmed.
[02:14:31.410 --> 02:14:33.671]  You had to see the news tonight about New York.
[02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:35.853]  And I love that place.
[02:14:35.913 --> 02:14:39.015]  And what they're doing to it is horrible, what they're doing to it.
[02:14:39.375 --> 02:14:41.696]  And all the courts do is they try and focus on Trump.
[02:14:42.097 --> 02:14:45.059]  Okay, let's focus on Trump, who did nothing wrong.
[02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:46.860]  I complain about a rigged election.
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:49.862]  Elon, what's happened is unbelievable.
[02:14:50.002 --> 02:14:51.603]  You have, from Africa,
[02:14:52.299 --> 02:14:55.483]  I just love how the EU threatened Trump in an official letter.
[02:14:55.523 --> 02:14:56.084]  It's unenforced.
[02:14:56.104 --> 02:14:56.705]  I retweeted it today.
[02:14:56.725 --> 02:14:58.607]  If you don't believe me, folks, you can't believe it.
[02:15:12.103 --> 02:15:14.625]  They said, you better watch what Trump says, we might arrest you.
[02:15:15.205 --> 02:15:16.846]  And then you got the UK saying the same thing.
[02:15:16.866 --> 02:15:17.847]  They're desperate.
[02:15:18.227 --> 02:15:19.848]  They don't even understand Streisand effect.
[02:15:19.868 --> 02:15:20.949]  They should have shut up.
[02:15:21.349 --> 02:15:23.251]  Owen Harrison, lay Trump down for a minute.
[02:15:23.271 --> 02:15:27.133]  I mean, like, you want people to watch something, tell them they can't have it.
[02:15:27.454 --> 02:15:33.378]  Well, but there's something else going on, I think, in Europe, but specifically in the UK right now.
[02:15:33.518 --> 02:15:36.380]  They've seemed to gone completely... Cuckoo.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.841]  Yeah, I mean, this whole...
[02:15:38.786 --> 02:15:52.694]  What's been happening between the Muslim community and the traditional British community is one thing, and then the response from the government against the people of Britain has been another thing, and it's almost just like they've decided, we're just going all in.
[02:15:52.754 --> 02:15:56.116]  So, okay, you're an Englishman, we're going to destroy you.
[02:15:56.156 --> 02:15:56.736]  Oh, you're Elon Musk.
[02:15:56.756 --> 02:16:05.481]  If you come out of your business and are seen by face scanning cameras when Muslims are rioting, almost all the rioting was Muslims, you get two years in jail.
[02:16:06.221 --> 02:16:11.202]  If you're a black guy from Africa and kill a white kid with a machete, you get six months.
[02:16:11.622 --> 02:16:13.743]  If you post a meme I don't like, you get two years.
[02:16:13.903 --> 02:16:16.603]  I mean, folks, two-tier isn't even the beginning of it.
[02:16:16.643 --> 02:16:16.963]  Harrison?
[02:16:17.243 --> 02:16:18.884]  No, it's impossible to even imagine.
[02:16:18.904 --> 02:16:23.545]  I mean, it's crazy knowing that this was going to be the plan and then seeing it unfold is a whole nother level.
[02:16:23.585 --> 02:16:34.547]  When you see them literally emptying the jails of hundreds of thousands of people because it's overcrowded, while simultaneously filling those jails back up with, you know, fathers of three who tweet something objectionable.
[02:16:34.967 --> 02:16:36.008]  Horrifying.
[02:16:36.028 --> 02:16:38.949]  68-year-old war heroes that were just there.
[02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:42.331]  There was one woman, she said, I don't even know what I'm accused of.
[02:16:42.411 --> 02:16:43.432]  I don't know what I did wrong.
[02:16:43.452 --> 02:16:46.994]  She said, I've been sentenced to something about, you know, racial awareness.
[02:16:47.054 --> 02:16:49.495]  I have to go to some class, but I don't even know what I've been sentenced for.
[02:16:49.515 --> 02:16:52.997]  That's because they can't have England and the UK and Ireland and Scotland wake up.
[02:16:53.237 --> 02:16:56.259]  Because that's the plan for the world, is to bring in foreigners they control.
[02:16:56.479 --> 02:16:58.300]  We don't even hate the foreigners, but they're a weapon.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:03.584]  Yeah, and of course no other civilization is accepting this.
[02:17:03.824 --> 02:17:05.245]  The Middle East doesn't accept this.
[02:17:05.325 --> 02:17:07.066]  The Far East doesn't accept this.
[02:17:07.106 --> 02:17:11.850]  Yeah, can we have, say, 100,000 white people move to Pakistan and say we're going to run for office?
[02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:12.390]  They'd kill us.
[02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:14.312]  Get free stuff, too, while they're at it?
[02:17:14.332 --> 02:17:15.773]  Get protection from the government?
[02:17:15.793 --> 02:17:16.273]  Yeah, not going to happen.
[02:17:16.293 --> 02:17:17.114]  They wouldn't laugh at us.
[02:17:17.134 --> 02:17:17.934]  Let's go back to Trump.
[02:17:18.375 --> 02:17:23.879]  The President of the United States, he didn't want to leave and they said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way.
[02:17:24.531 --> 02:17:27.955]  Yeah, I mean they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him.
[02:17:28.316 --> 02:17:34.122]  No, what they did with this guy, and I'm no fan of his, and he was a horrible president, the worst president in history.
[02:17:34.423 --> 02:17:38.768]  And one of the reasons he was so bad, first of all, the Israeli attack would have never happened.
[02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:41.271]  Russia would never have attacked Ukraine.
[02:17:41.772 --> 02:17:42.872]  And we'd have no inflation.
[02:17:43.213 --> 02:17:46.154]  And we wouldn't have had the Afghanistan mess, if you think of it.
[02:17:46.454 --> 02:17:48.115]  And we wouldn't have had Afghanistan.
[02:17:48.475 --> 02:17:49.255]  But think of it.
[02:17:50.416 --> 02:17:53.277]  You take a few of those events away, and we have a different world.
[02:17:53.737 --> 02:17:55.118]  We would also have no inflation.
[02:17:55.538 --> 02:17:57.158]  Inflation was caused by oil.
[02:17:58.559 --> 02:17:59.960]  Yeah.
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:00.700]  Trump gets that.
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:02.541]  You lower energy costs, it lowers inflation.
[02:18:02.581 --> 02:18:03.521]  It's the base.
[02:18:03.921 --> 02:18:04.802]  And fertilizer.
[02:18:05.082 --> 02:18:06.142]  Oil and fertilizer.
[02:18:06.442 --> 02:18:07.943]  Thinking about invading or doing bad things.
[02:18:08.839 --> 02:18:12.502]  When they're thinking about that, they're thinking about, OK, what's the American president going to do?
[02:18:12.963 --> 02:18:19.308]  And do they fear the American president or is there someone they do not respect and do not fear?
[02:18:24.674 --> 02:18:29.257]  I mean, look at the footage of the assassination.
[02:18:29.277 --> 02:18:35.602]  They're like, okay, you know, President Trump is like, don't mess with me.
[02:18:35.622 --> 02:18:46.129]  I mean, that's like, whereas I think people are not going to be, and they obviously have not been at all intimidated by Biden, and they certainly will not be intimidated by Kamala.
[02:18:46.169 --> 02:18:49.672]  And you have to really think about it in the context of global security.
[02:18:50.536 --> 02:19:02.118]  Um, that's, that's, that if the, if the American president is someone, someone that like, you know, evil dictators are scared of, that makes a huge difference to the security of the world.
[02:19:02.539 --> 02:19:08.080]  So I had a good relationship with Putin despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax that lasted for over two years.
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:12.481]  Just a hoax created by Hillary Clinton and, uh, Adam Shifty Schiff.
[02:19:12.621 --> 02:19:15.801]  Some just bad people, you know, just sick people, frankly.
[02:19:15.861 --> 02:19:17.682]  I mean, Schiff, Schiff is a sick person.
[02:19:17.722 --> 02:19:19.502]  He's going to end up probably being a Senator.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:20.781]  It's hard to believe.
[02:19:20.821 --> 02:19:22.103]  The whole thing is hard to believe.
[02:19:22.143 --> 02:19:25.789]  But, you know, they put our country in danger with that stuff, too.
[02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:30.475]  They actually, when they make up stories and you have to fight your way out of it for a long time.
[02:19:30.515 --> 02:19:32.338]  But I know Putin very well.
[02:19:32.358 --> 02:19:33.540]  I got along with him very well.
[02:19:34.042 --> 02:19:36.764]  He respected me and it's just one of those things.
[02:19:36.864 --> 02:19:40.567]  And he would, we would talk a lot about Ukraine.
[02:19:40.667 --> 02:19:41.968]  It was the apple of his eye.
[02:19:42.308 --> 02:19:43.509]  But I said, don't ever do it.
[02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:44.450]  Don't ever do it.
[02:19:44.710 --> 02:19:46.051]  You know, I shut down Nord Stream 2.
[02:19:46.271 --> 02:19:50.314]  That was the big oil pipeline, the biggest, I think the biggest pipeline in the world going all over Europe.
[02:19:50.374 --> 02:19:51.115]  I shut it down.
[02:19:51.755 --> 02:19:54.917]  Biden came and then they say, I, you know, I was, I loved Russia.
[02:19:54.957 --> 02:19:56.779]  I was a friend of Putin and I loved Russia.
[02:19:57.546 --> 02:20:01.087]  He actually said to me one time, he said, if you're my friend, I'd hate to see you as an enemy.
[02:20:01.147 --> 02:20:04.088]  I shut down his pipeline, the biggest pipeline.
[02:20:04.148 --> 02:20:05.528]  They were looking at that fund.
[02:20:06.108 --> 02:20:10.229]  And this, this pathetic president gets in there.
[02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:20.511]  And the first thing he did, one of the early things he did is he shut down, he shut down Keystone XL pipeline, which is our pipeline that would have employed 48,000 people, pipeline workers.
[02:20:23.444 --> 02:20:23.704]  Yeah.
[02:20:23.764 --> 02:20:23.844]  Yeah.
[02:20:53.936 --> 02:20:55.297]  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[02:20:55.758 --> 02:20:58.480]  It's like it's inconsistent.
[02:20:59.421 --> 02:21:14.575]  But I mean, I think it's just worth emphasizing to listeners that the immense importance of whether the United States president is intimidating or not intimidating and how much that matters to global security.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:22.563]  Because there's some real tough characters out there, and if they don't think the American president is tough, they will do what they want to do.
[02:21:22.623 --> 02:21:24.944]  I know every one of them.
[02:21:25.024 --> 02:21:26.325]  It puts the whole world in danger.
[02:21:26.365 --> 02:21:28.506]  Elon, I know every one of them, and I know them well.
[02:21:28.686 --> 02:21:29.326]  I know Putin.
[02:21:29.346 --> 02:21:30.467]  I know President Xi.
[02:21:30.527 --> 02:21:32.008]  I know Kim Jong-un of North Korea.
[02:21:32.048 --> 02:21:32.928]  I know every one of them.
[02:21:33.548 --> 02:21:36.370]  And let me tell you, people will say, oh, this is terrible.
[02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:38.951]  He said, I'm not saying anything good or bad.
[02:21:39.191 --> 02:21:40.611]  They're at the top of their game.
[02:21:40.972 --> 02:21:41.692]  They're tough.
[02:21:41.852 --> 02:21:42.712]  They're smart.
[02:21:43.153 --> 02:21:43.833]  They're vicious.
[02:21:44.457 --> 02:21:44.897]  We're good to go.
[02:22:02.443 --> 02:22:06.005]  All the stuff that you're seeing now, all the horror that you—look at Israel.
[02:22:06.205 --> 02:22:08.546]  They're all waiting for an attack from Iran.
[02:22:08.626 --> 02:22:10.486]  Iran would not be attacking, believe me.
[02:22:10.887 --> 02:22:17.169]  You know, when I was there—and I say it with respect, because I think we would have been good with Iran.
[02:22:17.189 --> 02:22:18.790]  I don't want to do anything bad to Iran.
[02:22:19.170 --> 02:22:20.611]  But they knew not to mess around.
[02:22:21.011 --> 02:22:21.971]  Iran was broke.
[02:22:22.411 --> 02:22:26.253]  Because I told China, if you buy from Iran oil—it's all about the oil.
[02:22:26.333 --> 02:22:27.193]  That's where the money is.
[02:22:27.693 --> 02:22:31.575]  But if you buy oil from Iran, you're not going to do any business.
[02:22:31.988 --> 02:22:32.988]  With the United States.
[02:22:33.869 --> 02:22:34.449]  And I meant it.
[02:22:34.849 --> 02:22:35.930]  And they said, we'll pass.
[02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:36.870]  They didn't buy oil.
[02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:38.491]  Other countries likewise.
[02:22:38.511 --> 02:22:39.211]  You want to buy?
[02:22:39.531 --> 02:22:41.132]  You're not doing business with the United States.
[02:22:41.512 --> 02:22:45.033]  And they were at a point where they were, they had no money for Hamas.
[02:22:45.193 --> 02:22:46.574]  They had no money for Hezbollah.
[02:22:46.594 --> 02:22:49.095]  They had no money for any of these instruments of terror.
[02:22:49.915 --> 02:22:51.836]  And it was amazing.
[02:22:52.036 --> 02:22:58.519]  In fact, there were articles when I was leaving, which is hard to believe, actually, especially when you look at what's happened to our country.
[02:22:58.559 --> 02:23:00.099]  Our country is so bad right now.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.240]  It's such a different place.
[02:23:01.604 --> 02:23:02.584]  We were respected.
[02:23:03.064 --> 02:23:03.484]  Think of it.
[02:23:03.825 --> 02:23:14.087]  Four years ago, we were so respected to a point where when I said, don't buy oil, they didn't buy oil, but they had no money and Israel would have never been attacked.
[02:23:14.487 --> 02:23:15.887]  It is zero chance.
[02:23:16.347 --> 02:23:18.928]  And again, I said to Vladimir Putin, I say, don't do it.
[02:23:19.408 --> 02:23:20.088]  You can't do it.
[02:23:20.108 --> 02:23:21.229]  Vladimir, you do it.
[02:23:21.449 --> 02:23:22.969]  It's going to be a bad day.
[02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:24.409]  You cannot do it.
[02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:27.490]  And I told him things that what I do.
[02:23:28.442 --> 02:23:30.103]  And he said, no way.
[02:23:30.503 --> 02:23:31.443]  And I said, way.
[02:23:32.504 --> 02:23:34.704]  And you know, it's the last time we ever had the conversation.
[02:23:35.185 --> 02:23:36.425]  He would never have done.
[02:23:36.485 --> 02:23:37.526]  I got along well with him.
[02:23:37.666 --> 02:23:39.546]  I hope to get along well with him again.
[02:23:39.887 --> 02:23:42.988]  You know, getting along well with them is a good thing, not a bad thing.
[02:23:43.268 --> 02:23:44.968]  I got along well with him, John Lennon.
[02:23:45.369 --> 02:23:50.671]  When I met with President Obama just before entering, you know, it's sort of a ritual.
[02:23:51.331 --> 02:23:53.152]  And I sat down with him and we talked.
[02:23:53.212 --> 02:23:55.032]  It was supposed to be for a very short period of time.
[02:23:55.072 --> 02:23:56.393]  It turned out to be a long period of time.
[02:23:56.992 --> 02:23:58.353]  I said, what's the biggest problem?
[02:23:58.373 --> 02:23:59.333]  He said, North Korea.
[02:24:00.173 --> 02:24:01.974]  I had that problem worked out very quickly.
[02:24:01.994 --> 02:24:05.936]  It was nasty at the beginning with Rocket Man and, you know, all the different things.
[02:24:06.877 --> 02:24:08.177]  All of a sudden I got a call.
[02:24:08.197 --> 02:24:10.678]  Those were some epic tweets, by the way.
[02:24:10.718 --> 02:24:12.079]  No, they were epic everything.
[02:24:12.139 --> 02:24:15.440]  He said that he has a red button on his desk.
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:21.223]  I said, I have a red button on my desk too, but my red button is much bigger and my red button works.
[02:24:21.894 --> 02:24:24.555]  And then I called him Little Rocket Man of Little Rocket Man.
[02:24:24.915 --> 02:24:26.515]  Anyway, here's the bottom line.
[02:24:26.615 --> 02:24:30.516]  All of a sudden, I got a call from him, and they said they want to meet.
[02:24:30.656 --> 02:24:31.276]  They want to meet me.
[02:24:31.296 --> 02:24:34.016]  And we met, as you remember, we met in Singapore.
[02:24:34.036 --> 02:24:35.657]  We met also in Vietnam.
[02:24:36.437 --> 02:24:38.917]  And I got along with him great.
[02:24:38.957 --> 02:24:39.978]  We were in no danger.
[02:24:40.318 --> 02:24:45.799]  But President Obama thought we were going to end up in a war, a nuclear war with him.
[02:24:45.899 --> 02:24:48.359]  And let me tell you, he's got a lot of nuclear stuff too.
[02:24:48.399 --> 02:24:49.580]  He's got plenty of nuclear.
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:51.400]  He can do plenty of damage.
[02:24:52.530 --> 02:24:59.873]  Yes, I mean it's because people like Kim Jong-un, they respond to strength, not weakness.
[02:25:00.813 --> 02:25:04.795]  He and I had a good relationship.
[02:25:05.195 --> 02:25:07.736]  Remember I met him and we walked onto his land.
[02:25:07.796 --> 02:25:09.516]  Nobody ever walked onto his land before.
[02:25:09.976 --> 02:25:15.058]  I wouldn't say, let's bring up Secret Service again, I wouldn't say they were thrilled when I did that.
[02:25:15.078 --> 02:25:19.840]  I walked onto his land and it was an amazing period.
[02:25:20.686 --> 02:25:23.087]  But we were not in danger with him because of me.
[02:25:23.107 --> 02:25:28.909]  You know, I always say that we have enemies on the outside and we have enemies on the inside.
[02:25:28.929 --> 02:25:36.031]  We have some really bad people in our government and people that are controlling the people
[02:25:36.621 --> 02:25:39.562]  I mean, I'd mention names, but I don't, I really don't want to give them the credit.
[02:25:39.922 --> 02:25:44.283]  But we have some really bad, and I say they're more dangerous than Russia and China.
[02:25:44.784 --> 02:25:53.566]  If you have a smart president, a president that gets it, we are not in danger from those countries because they need us and they need our help.
[02:25:54.027 --> 02:26:04.150]  I mean, we forced Obama, if you think about it, Obama and Biden and Bush to a certain extent, in all fairness, forced Russia and China
[02:26:04.838 --> 02:26:05.318]  Together.
[02:26:05.919 --> 02:26:11.081]  And if you're a history student, the first thing you learn is you cannot let Russia and China align.
[02:26:11.341 --> 02:26:16.123]  But then they also got, if you take a look, Iran, and they have North Korea.
[02:26:16.763 --> 02:26:19.084]  That's, you know, they call it the axis of evil.
[02:26:19.665 --> 02:26:21.586]  In the old days, you had the axis of evil.
[02:26:21.626 --> 02:26:23.466]  Here we have a modern day axis of evil.
[02:26:23.927 --> 02:26:24.427]  These are
[02:26:25.279 --> 02:26:29.381]  Powerful countries, very heavy nuclear, which is the biggest threat.
[02:26:29.561 --> 02:26:35.644]  You know, the biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean's gonna rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years.
[02:26:36.484 --> 02:26:39.346]  And you'll have more oceanfront property, right?
[02:26:39.726 --> 02:26:41.307]  The biggest threat is not that.
[02:26:41.367 --> 02:26:43.067]  The biggest threat is nuclear warming.
[02:26:43.868 --> 02:26:50.491]  Because we have five countries now that have significant nuclear power, and we have to not allow
[02:26:51.528 --> 02:26:53.829]  Anything to happen with stupid people like Biden.
[02:26:54.209 --> 02:26:57.290]  You know, Biden did something with Russia.
[02:26:58.110 --> 02:27:00.011]  There was no chance of him ever going in.
[02:27:00.231 --> 02:27:03.532]  And when I left, and then after I left... We're going to go back.
[02:27:03.552 --> 02:27:07.633]  Again, if you want the raw feed, it's on X of Trump and Elon Musk.
[02:27:07.673 --> 02:27:08.173]  Amazing.
[02:27:08.733 --> 02:27:11.534]  Launched about 47 minutes late because of DDoS attacks.
[02:27:11.574 --> 02:27:12.554]  We're here, we're covering it.
[02:27:13.155 --> 02:27:14.595]  When it's over, the next 45 minutes.
[02:27:15.395 --> 02:27:17.876]  I'm supposed to join right now, but it started late.
[02:27:19.857 --> 02:27:20.877]  Mario Nofal and...
[02:27:22.617 --> 02:27:27.399]  Nick Sordor and others with spaces to take your comments, but we're going to stay up here as long as it takes.
[02:27:27.959 --> 02:27:28.800]  Let me say this, though.
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:31.321]  I've got crew that was here at 6am this morning.
[02:27:31.341 --> 02:27:32.361]  I have a very small crew.
[02:27:33.762 --> 02:27:34.582]  I need your support.
[02:27:35.383 --> 02:27:39.504]  So, InfoWars is hanging on by its fingernails at this critical time.

[02:27:47.348 --> 02:27:48.268]  Alex Jones is real.
[02:27:48.308 --> 02:27:48.869]  Trump's real.
[02:27:48.909 --> 02:27:49.289]  This is real.
[02:27:49.589 --> 02:27:50.229]  Support Trump.
[02:27:50.269 --> 02:27:50.849]  Donate to him.

[02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:51.710]  Vote for him.
[02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:53.750]  Elon's putting in hundreds of millions.
[02:27:54.250 --> 02:27:54.751]  I don't have that.
[02:27:54.951 --> 02:27:56.311]  I need millions to operate.
[02:27:56.351 --> 02:27:58.612]  We sell great t-shirts, great books, great films.

[02:29:11.431 --> 02:29:13.132]  It takes money to win the war.
[02:29:13.232 --> 02:29:14.593]  Plus, we have great products.

[02:29:20.018 --> 02:29:21.219]  INFOWARESTORE.COM.
[02:29:21.259 --> 02:29:27.043]  We cannot do it without you, so I'm asking you now to take action at DRJONESNATURALS.COM and INFOWARESTORE.COM.
[02:29:27.063 --> 02:29:29.926]  Before we go back to Elon, and look, I love Trump, and it's a good interview.
[02:29:30.666 --> 02:29:45.812]  But he thinks results get him to places, which is true in the real world, but he needs to be talking about the Secret Service stood down, Ronald McDonald Roe stood down and lied to Congress, the New World Order, all the things that went on.
[02:29:46.312 --> 02:29:54.555]  I'm not giving Trump a minus here, but I'm giving him like a B plus instead of an A plus, and maybe he'll go there, but I'm really wishing for something else here.
[02:29:55.333 --> 02:30:01.402]  Well, and I'd like the messaging that we saw in one of his ads today to really be enhanced to an extreme degree.
[02:30:01.622 --> 02:30:04.907]  Like, it needs to be branded on the Democrats' forehead.
[02:30:05.427 --> 02:30:11.055]  And that's this idea that a vote for the Democrat Party is a vote for them to control your life.
[02:30:11.656 --> 02:30:24.028]  You know, the Democrats want to brand Trump with this Nazi, racist, KKK thing, and that's why they engage in their messaging, so that when people go to the booth, they think, oh well, I don't want to vote for that guy, I don't want to vote for the Nazi, they're not even thinking about policy.
[02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:28.131]  So instead of us defending Trump, we point out that they're the real supporters of the KKK.
[02:30:28.812 --> 02:30:29.653]  Well, maybe.
[02:30:29.673 --> 02:30:37.783]  I just think they have to engage in the same tactics of, what do you want the person that's about to pull that lever for the Democrat to think?
[02:30:38.123 --> 02:30:38.964]  Not about Trump.
[02:30:39.024 --> 02:30:42.448]  Think, if I vote Democrat, they're going to tell me what I can and can't eat.
[02:30:42.488 --> 02:30:45.071]  If you vote Democrat, they're going to kill you with inflation.
[02:30:45.111 --> 02:30:46.152]  I mean, don't they get it?
[02:30:46.773 --> 02:30:47.714]  No, no.
[02:30:47.874 --> 02:30:52.617]  It needs to be propagandized into the reality for these people.
[02:30:52.637 --> 02:30:57.741]  They need to brand the Democrat forehead with government will control your life.
[02:30:58.041 --> 02:31:00.783]  And you're in a cult and you're a schmuck and you're a loser.
[02:31:00.803 --> 02:31:01.504]  Harrison, what do you think?
[02:31:01.884 --> 02:31:02.584]  No, I completely agree.
[02:31:02.624 --> 02:31:03.945]  And I'm sitting here listening to Donald Trump.
[02:31:03.965 --> 02:31:04.965]  He's doing a fantastic job.
[02:31:05.005 --> 02:31:07.025]  He's hitting a lot of the points that we're talking about.
[02:31:07.566 --> 02:31:08.466]  But he's talking about war.
[02:31:08.486 --> 02:31:09.966]  He's talking about nuclear conflict.
[02:31:10.006 --> 02:31:11.347]  He's talking about geopolitics.
[02:31:11.567 --> 02:31:12.927]  And then you listen to the Kamala supporters.
[02:31:13.147 --> 02:31:14.968]  They're talking about abortion and pink hair.
[02:31:15.068 --> 02:31:17.868]  So it's like, does it even matter to them what they're voting for?
[02:31:17.888 --> 02:31:18.088]  No, I agree.
[02:31:18.108 --> 02:31:19.149]  They're so brainwashed.
[02:31:19.169 --> 02:31:19.989]  They're another planet.
[02:31:20.449 --> 02:31:22.310]  Yeah, it's, you know, this is the important stuff.
[02:31:22.330 --> 02:31:27.011]  The important stuff is we have to have a president that keeps us strong so that the world doesn't descend into nuclear winter.
[02:31:27.531 --> 02:31:28.251]  No, I mean, I agree.
[02:31:28.291 --> 02:31:29.051]  I totally agree.
[02:31:29.111 --> 02:31:30.812]  Let's go back to Trump and what he said.
[02:31:32.535 --> 02:31:40.038]  The thing that they really is making them angry is what Kamala and Biden have allowed to happen to the economy.
[02:31:40.218 --> 02:31:42.719]  It's a disaster with inflation.
[02:31:43.039 --> 02:31:47.841]  The inflation, it doesn't matter what you make, the inflation is eating you alive.
[02:31:47.882 --> 02:31:58.426]  If you're a worker or if you're a just a middle income person, you can't afford, you know, four years ago, five years ago, people were saving a lot of money.
[02:31:59.051 --> 02:32:02.352]  Today they're using all their money and borrowing money just to live.
[02:32:02.372 --> 02:32:04.873]  It's a horrible thing that's happening.
[02:32:05.573 --> 02:32:07.754]  And we'll end that quickly.
[02:32:08.655 --> 02:32:11.556]  A lot of people just don't understand where inflation comes from.
[02:32:12.376 --> 02:32:14.177]  Inflation comes from government overspending.
[02:32:14.597 --> 02:32:16.858]  Because the checks never bounce when it's written by the government.
[02:32:16.878 --> 02:32:23.060]  So if the government spends far more than it brings in, that increases the money supply.
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:27.342]  And if the money supply increases faster than the rate of goods and services, that's inflation.
[02:32:30.579 --> 02:32:34.880]  Expanding economy and cheap energy and we're handled.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:36.781]  We can get past the inflation.
[02:32:36.961 --> 02:32:37.481]  Trump said it.
[02:32:37.501 --> 02:32:42.983]  You've got to increase energy, which means energy for plants is fertilizer and oil and gas.
[02:32:43.303 --> 02:32:43.663]  It's that.
[02:32:43.903 --> 02:32:45.204]  Everything's energy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:47.312 --> 02:32:50.055]  Cheap water, cheap fertilizer, cheap oil.
[02:32:50.075 --> 02:32:54.538]  I rebuilt our military, largely rebuilt our military, did a great job on it.
[02:33:07.529 --> 02:33:08.290]  Which was so important.
[02:33:08.310 --> 02:33:13.313]  You know, we had jets, we had fighters that were, uh, and bombers that were 70 years old.
[02:33:13.373 --> 02:33:14.894]  And we, we did a great job in that.
[02:33:15.154 --> 02:33:19.316]  Then we, by the way, then we gave 85 billion of it back to Afghanistan.
[02:33:19.336 --> 02:33:25.060]  If you can believe it, we gave them 85 billion that, you know, they're one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world.
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:26.421]  They're selling what we gave them.
[02:33:27.601 --> 02:33:30.964]  That was one of the most embarrassing days in the history of our country.
[02:33:31.364 --> 02:33:36.387]  But, uh, if you think about go, let's go back to the, uh, the economy.
[02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:38.701]  We have to bring energy prices down.
[02:33:38.841 --> 02:33:42.144]  Energy started at the price of gasoline.
[02:33:42.684 --> 02:33:48.588]  Now, your cars don't require too much gasoline, so you have a good, and you do make a great product, I have to say.
[02:33:48.648 --> 02:33:49.849]  I have to be honest with you.
[02:33:49.869 --> 02:33:53.692]  That doesn't mean everybody should have an electric car, but these are minor details.
[02:33:53.752 --> 02:33:55.453]  But your product is incredible.
[02:33:55.513 --> 02:33:56.834]  Yeah, if you're getting an electric car, get a Tesla.
[02:33:56.854 --> 02:34:00.597]  But the gasoline, Elon, is the cost of energy.
[02:34:00.737 --> 02:34:03.759]  Not only gasoline, it's the cost of heating your house and cooling your house.
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:05.761]  That has to come down.
[02:34:06.933 --> 02:34:12.998]  It's gone up a hundred percent, a hundred and fifty and two hundred percent, and that has to come down.
[02:34:13.339 --> 02:34:15.700]  When that comes down and we're going to drill, baby, drill.
[02:34:15.941 --> 02:34:21.825]  You know, they stopped drilling and then they went back to drilling because they went back to the Trump policy.
[02:34:22.206 --> 02:34:24.948]  But if they won the day after they get into office.
[02:34:26.227 --> 02:34:32.252]  This country will go out of business because they're going to go to an energy policy that's not sustainable.
[02:34:32.312 --> 02:34:34.053]  Wind and different things.
[02:34:34.834 --> 02:34:35.895]  You're not going to have anything.
[02:34:36.335 --> 02:34:38.677]  And I know you're a big fan of the A.I.
[02:34:39.378 --> 02:34:43.942]  And I have to say that A.I., and this is shocking to me, but A.I.
[02:34:44.402 --> 02:34:48.566]  requires twice the energy that the country already produces for everything.
[02:34:50.385 --> 02:34:53.266]  And notice the leftists never want to cut the energy for that.
[02:34:54.087 --> 02:34:55.387]  Just cut the farmers off.
[02:34:55.427 --> 02:34:56.928]  Give AI all it wants.
[02:34:57.048 --> 02:34:57.528]  Bullshit.
[02:34:57.548 --> 02:34:58.069]  Food, not AI.
[02:34:58.189 --> 02:35:00.830]  I'm not against AI, but not at the cost of food.
[02:35:10.222 --> 02:35:11.042]  Sure.
[02:35:11.323 --> 02:35:21.748]  Well, just going back to this basic thing, which is that people try to make it sound complicated, but it's not, but inflation is caused by government overspending.
[02:35:21.928 --> 02:35:28.691]  Would you agree that we need to take a look at government spending and have perhaps a government efficiency commission?
[02:35:30.205 --> 02:35:30.765]  This is big.
[02:35:31.366 --> 02:35:36.230]  Trump responds to Elon's government efficiency commission.
[02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:37.811]  This is big.
[02:35:38.631 --> 02:35:40.213]  Nobody negotiates prices.
[02:35:41.193 --> 02:35:46.978]  You used to have a lot of people making jets and you end up with two companies and they'll probably try and merge at some point.
[02:35:47.458 --> 02:35:49.360]  I mean, I went through it.
[02:35:50.054 --> 02:35:52.835]  Like Air Force, just a thing like Air Force One.
[02:35:53.135 --> 02:35:57.277]  One of the first documents they asked me to sign in general, I said, sir, would you please sign this document?
[02:35:57.297 --> 02:35:57.757]  And what is it?
[02:35:58.218 --> 02:36:03.160]  Air Force One, that's with Boeing, which is basically two planes, two 747s.
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.161]  And the price was $5.7 billion for two planes.
[02:36:07.221 --> 02:36:09.242]  Now they're highly sophisticated.
[02:36:09.322 --> 02:36:09.782]  That's insane.
[02:36:09.822 --> 02:36:11.663]  They're even nicer than your plane, okay?
[02:36:11.703 --> 02:36:13.124]  But much more sophisticated.
[02:36:13.144 --> 02:36:16.165]  They're very, I won't say what's on it, but they got a lot of stuff on it.
[02:36:16.265 --> 02:36:17.126]  Anyway, but it's 5.7.
[02:36:18.915 --> 02:36:19.735]  That's a crazy number.
[02:36:19.755 --> 02:36:20.516]  It's a crazy number.
[02:36:20.576 --> 02:36:22.416]  But I said, I'm not going to pay 5.7.
[02:36:22.456 --> 02:36:23.177]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:36:23.437 --> 02:36:24.437]  I said, who made the deal?
[02:36:24.517 --> 02:36:25.658]  Obama and his people.
[02:36:25.958 --> 02:36:27.738]  I said, well, then I know the deal's no good.
[02:36:27.818 --> 02:36:28.639]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:36:29.239 --> 02:36:35.701]  And over the course of about four weeks, by my saying, I'm not going to do it, I got the price reduced by $1.6 billion.
[02:36:37.768 --> 02:36:41.471]  For the exact same plane, other than we had a nicer paint job, if you want to know the truth.
[02:36:41.851 --> 02:36:45.333]  But for the exact same plane, I saved one.
[02:36:45.433 --> 02:36:48.255]  And I said to Boeing, man, you guys must make a lot of money.
[02:36:48.295 --> 02:36:51.197]  By the way, it's George Soros' birthday today.
[02:36:51.438 --> 02:36:53.599]  It might be Alex Soros' honeymoon, too.
[02:36:53.819 --> 02:36:58.082]  Alex Soros goes, Tim Walz is a football guy.
[02:36:58.182 --> 02:36:59.163]  Everybody loves football.
[02:36:59.183 --> 02:37:02.045]  It's like he's an alien going, the humans like football.
[02:37:02.425 --> 02:37:06.088]  I'm wondering about Tim Walz's desire to get involved in youth football.
[02:37:07.418 --> 02:37:10.580]  Oh, if I was going to cast somebody in a movie to play a pedophile, I'd hire Tim Walsh.
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:12.141]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[02:37:12.241 --> 02:37:16.504]  I'm just saying what kind of guy wants to show young boys how to use a tampon?
[02:37:16.724 --> 02:37:19.386]  And gives pedophiles time off jail.
[02:37:19.946 --> 02:37:34.715]  So, I mean, I mean, I think it would be great to just have a permanent agency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that the taxpayer money, the taxpayers hard-earned money is spent in a good way.
[02:37:36.164 --> 02:37:38.966]  And I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.
[02:37:39.066 --> 02:37:39.446]  I'd love it.
[02:37:39.466 --> 02:37:40.087]  If it were phone.
[02:37:40.327 --> 02:37:42.008]  Well, you, you're the greatest cutter.
[02:37:42.448 --> 02:37:43.549]  I mean, I look at what you do.
[02:37:43.589 --> 02:37:46.031]  You walk in and you just say, you want to quit?
[02:37:46.171 --> 02:37:47.552]  They go on strike.
[02:37:47.652 --> 02:37:51.014]  I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, that's okay.
[02:37:51.034 --> 02:37:51.694]  You're all gone.
[02:37:52.395 --> 02:37:53.115]  You're all gone.
[02:37:53.195 --> 02:37:55.397]  So every one of you has gone and you are the greatest.
[02:37:55.417 --> 02:37:56.237]  You would be very good.
[02:37:56.638 --> 02:37:57.338]  Oh, you would love it.
[02:37:57.618 --> 02:38:00.320]  But you know, if you look at our... I'd be happy to help out.
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:01.501]  By the way, congratulations.
[02:38:01.561 --> 02:38:04.723]  I just looked at the number of people that are listening to you and I chat.
[02:38:04.983 --> 02:38:05.764]  We'll call it a chat.
[02:38:06.408 --> 02:38:08.330]  But congratulations.
[02:38:08.370 --> 02:38:09.171]  This is very good.
[02:38:09.692 --> 02:38:10.653]  I mean, it's great.
[02:38:10.893 --> 02:38:12.555]  And you're an interesting character.
[02:38:12.615 --> 02:38:18.662]  You know, the new head of a place called Argentina.
[02:38:19.463 --> 02:38:21.805]  And he's great.
[02:38:22.266 --> 02:38:23.547]  And he's a big MAGA fan.
[02:38:23.567 --> 02:38:24.789]  You know that he ran on MAGA.
[02:38:26.388 --> 02:38:27.769]  He took it to an extreme, too.
[02:38:28.109 --> 02:38:31.431]  He ran on MAGA, and I hear he's doing really a terrific job.
[02:38:31.971 --> 02:38:33.832]  It's called Make Argentina Great Again.
[02:38:34.012 --> 02:38:35.333]  El Salvador's a better model.
[02:38:35.353 --> 02:38:36.973]  He bought a lot of hats he brought over.
[02:38:38.014 --> 02:38:38.814]  He's doing a big job.
[02:38:39.155 --> 02:38:41.136]  Bad advice on El Salvador.
[02:38:41.396 --> 02:38:45.618]  But must just volunteer to run the commission on government efficiency.
[02:38:46.058 --> 02:38:47.138]  That's huge.
[02:38:47.158 --> 02:38:50.020]  He took out nine out of ten of the Twitter employees and it works fine.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:57.083]  He's proven... I don't know if I would say that tonight, but... He's a maverick.
[02:38:57.743 --> 02:38:58.643]  No, I think that's great.
[02:38:58.823 --> 02:39:01.424]  I think that boosts... He's the Nikola Tesla of our time.
[02:39:01.444 --> 02:39:03.605]  That boosts Trump's electability to me.
[02:39:03.625 --> 02:39:05.766]  He's when Nikola Tesla got past the bureaucrats.
[02:39:05.906 --> 02:39:08.347]  Now just give RFK Jr.
[02:39:08.367 --> 02:39:10.808]  a spot on vaccine injuries and we're good.
[02:39:11.008 --> 02:39:11.949]  I agree.
[02:39:11.969 --> 02:39:12.749]  Let's be conservative.
[02:39:13.169 --> 02:39:16.132]  We're reaching 10 million extra people a day on my ex account.
[02:39:16.432 --> 02:39:19.015]  I ain't gonna bet you about that.
[02:39:19.175 --> 02:39:19.835]  Come on, man.
[02:39:20.256 --> 02:39:23.138]  And yeah, they admit they flag us, they attack us.
[02:39:23.238 --> 02:39:24.680]  It don't work, though.
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:26.882]  If we flood the zone.
[02:39:26.922 --> 02:39:27.542]  The truth wins.
[02:39:27.562 --> 02:39:38.613]  You're putting in regulations that make sense, and Argentina overnight is experiencing a giant improvement in prosperity.
[02:39:39.338 --> 02:39:47.024]  But it's also a lesson for the United States, which is that Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous countries in the world.
[02:39:49.206 --> 02:39:52.008]  Hey Chase, we got a Spaces going too right now, right?
[02:39:52.248 --> 02:39:53.569]  Are we simulcasting this on Spaces?
[02:39:53.589 --> 02:39:54.670]  You're on air right now, right?
[02:40:04.375 --> 02:40:05.016]  I want you on air.
[02:40:05.156 --> 02:40:05.516]  Come on air.
[02:40:05.536 --> 02:40:06.778]  I want everybody to hear everything.
[02:40:07.218 --> 02:40:08.000]  Total transparency.
[02:40:08.801 --> 02:40:11.584]  I'm not bitching, so we're not doing the spaces because that would mess up their spaces.
[02:40:12.185 --> 02:40:14.648]  When they're done, Nick Sorter wanted me to come on with him.
[02:40:14.708 --> 02:40:15.469]  Are we going to be able to join him?
[02:40:15.690 --> 02:40:17.612]  Yes, we will be able to as soon as this is over.
[02:40:17.812 --> 02:40:18.413]  Okay, that's great.
[02:40:18.433 --> 02:40:19.234]  We'll do it with him.
[02:40:19.535 --> 02:40:19.675]  Great.
[02:40:19.695 --> 02:40:21.177]  I just want to talk to people, all right?
[02:40:22.448 --> 02:40:25.169]  That'll all restream at Real Alex Jones on X, folks.
[02:40:25.589 --> 02:40:26.649]  But you should repost.
[02:40:27.189 --> 02:40:31.610]  Go to Real Alex Jones and say, if you want to see the censored feed of Trump and Elon, here it is.
[02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:32.270]  Please do it again.
[02:40:32.370 --> 02:40:32.890]  Great job.
[02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:34.831]  We're ranked number 40, number 38.
[02:40:36.711 --> 02:40:42.312]  Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, different countries are ranked good.
[02:40:42.452 --> 02:40:44.913]  Actually, China's pretty close to the top.
[02:40:44.933 --> 02:40:46.233]  They're a top 6 or 7.
[02:40:47.033 --> 02:40:48.233]  But we're ranked at the bottom.
[02:40:48.413 --> 02:40:49.194]  Almost at the bottom.
[02:40:49.214 --> 02:40:49.194]  38, 39, 40.
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:52.760]  In other words, horrible.
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:56.321]  And yet we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world.
[02:40:56.342 --> 02:40:57.002]  So we spend more.
[02:40:57.582 --> 02:41:01.863]  And what I'm going to do, one of the first acts, and this is where I need an Elon Musk.
[02:41:02.003 --> 02:41:05.545]  I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts.
[02:41:06.105 --> 02:41:09.706]  I want to close up Department of Education, move education back to the States.
[02:41:10.538 --> 02:41:17.764]  Where states like Iowa, where states like Idaho, you know, not every state will do great.
[02:41:18.164 --> 02:41:26.471]  Because states that basically aren't doing good now, you look at Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he's terrible.
[02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:27.752]  He does a terrible job.
[02:41:27.792 --> 02:41:29.553]  So he's not going to do great with education.
[02:41:29.974 --> 02:41:32.796]  But of the 50, I would bet that 35 would do great.
[02:41:32.916 --> 02:41:33.236]  And 15 of them, or
[02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:41.413]  You know, 20 of them will be as good as Norway.
[02:41:41.433 --> 02:41:42.994]  You know, Norway is considered great.
[02:41:44.555 --> 02:41:45.236]  You can name them.
[02:41:45.336 --> 02:41:47.197]  I mean, just they're so good.
[02:41:47.518 --> 02:41:48.919]  Some of these countries are so good.
[02:41:49.419 --> 02:41:54.623]  But if you go into some of these really well-run states, you know, we have states that don't know what debt is.
[02:41:55.183 --> 02:41:58.326]  We have states that have low taxes, no debt.
[02:41:59.146 --> 02:42:01.427]  You know, they're really well run.
[02:42:02.028 --> 02:42:02.148]  Sure.
[02:42:02.208 --> 02:42:09.752]  And maybe they have certain advantages in terms of location, in terms of, you know, the land or the sun, the sun and the water and the whole thing.
[02:42:09.772 --> 02:42:11.793]  You know, there are a lot of advantages that some people have.
[02:42:11.813 --> 02:42:21.919]  But if you moved education back to the 50, you'll have some that won't do well, but you'll have, but they'll actually be forced to do better because it'll be a pretty bad situation.
[02:42:22.579 --> 02:42:26.281]  But if you think about it, you'll have some of these states, I'll bet you'd have 30, 35
[02:42:28.112 --> 02:42:29.513]  Yeah, I think you're making a good point in that if
[02:42:45.395 --> 02:42:54.441]  The states have to, if each individual, if each state has to compete against other states, then people will naturally move to states where it's better.
[02:42:54.541 --> 02:42:58.604]  Well, like California, you know, as we said, it's a badly run state.
[02:42:59.024 --> 02:43:07.330]  I could go through, I got so many friends that are in those states, even if they're Democrats, I hate to mention certain states, but Illinois is badly run with Pritzker.
[02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:08.751]  He's a real loser.
[02:43:09.151 --> 02:43:11.893]  But, you know, some of these places are just
[02:43:12.677 --> 02:43:13.298]  Badly run.
[02:43:13.498 --> 02:43:21.324]  But you know, it's almost going to force them to run better, and they won't do good initially, but you're not going to do worse than you're doing right now.
[02:43:21.784 --> 02:43:24.587]  And I would say that the cost, you would cut your cost by 50 or 60%.
[02:43:26.869 --> 02:43:32.393]  And you'd have a little monitor, you know, you want to make sure they're teaching English as an example, you know, give us a little English, right?
[02:43:32.773 --> 02:43:33.594]  Sure.
[02:43:33.654 --> 02:43:34.054]  Right.
[02:43:34.114 --> 02:43:38.537]  No, but I mean, I mean, some of these governors are like, are doing so badly.
[02:43:38.577 --> 02:43:46.262]  I mean, they got so many people moving out of their state, they should, they should get U-Haul Salesman of the Year Award because they're driving so much U-Haul.
[02:43:46.362 --> 02:43:47.843]  It's actually amazing.
[02:43:47.903 --> 02:43:48.643]  People moving out.
[02:43:48.723 --> 02:43:53.186]  Isn't it amazing to you as a businessman that they can even survive?
[02:43:53.226 --> 02:43:53.847]  Like Illinois,
[02:43:54.525 --> 02:43:57.187]  So many people are leaving, and you wonder, how do they survive?
[02:43:57.327 --> 02:43:58.729]  I mean, how do they survive?
[02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:04.213]  I saw where you left California and you moved to Texas.
[02:44:04.273 --> 02:44:05.494]  Texas does a great job.
[02:44:06.455 --> 02:44:15.582]  But, you know, I mean, I just wonder, how do these states survive when big businesses, a big oil company just left California, as you know, and they moved to Texas?
[02:44:16.103 --> 02:44:20.847]  How do these big states survive when they lose so many businesses?
[02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:23.750]  And their taxes are already really high.
[02:44:23.770 --> 02:44:25.971]  You know, their taxes are among the highest taxes.
[02:44:26.491 --> 02:44:29.631]  You almost wonder, how do they continue on?
[02:44:29.771 --> 02:44:34.112]  And in many cases, the governors don't do a good job and they're crime-ridden places.
[02:44:34.692 --> 02:44:37.233]  You wonder, how do they continue to just go on?
[02:44:38.093 --> 02:44:40.113]  It's not a good situation.
[02:44:41.494 --> 02:44:47.975]  I mean, I think the only thing that's going to force some of these states to change is if they risk bankruptcy and they're not getting bailed out by the federal government.
[02:44:47.995 --> 02:44:48.495]  Right, right.
[02:44:49.727 --> 02:44:51.527]  That's the only way it's going to get them changed.
[02:44:51.727 --> 02:45:09.991]  You remember the area in California where they had that where I guess somebody had sticky fingers and they stole a lot of money and they went into a form of chapter and it was very nasty for a period of time but now it's probably the most popular place in all of California so so you know.
[02:45:10.051 --> 02:45:11.411]  No this is a great point there Meg.
[02:45:11.531 --> 02:45:15.032]  I mean people are leaving New York, Illinois,
[02:45:17.421 --> 02:45:17.921]  California.
[02:45:18.361 --> 02:45:19.742]  California, obviously.
[02:45:20.162 --> 02:45:20.742]  Michigan.
[02:45:21.683 --> 02:45:22.523]  The blue states.
[02:45:22.583 --> 02:45:22.963]  Everywhere.
[02:45:23.043 --> 02:45:25.244]  I mean, they're just all flooding away.
[02:45:25.724 --> 02:45:29.125]  And the Democrats just increased taxes more because it's all they know.
[02:45:29.665 --> 02:45:31.206]  These are not smart people.
[02:45:31.566 --> 02:45:32.927]  Yeah, the globalists have a lot of power.
[02:45:32.967 --> 02:45:33.927]  They have big actuaries.
[02:45:33.947 --> 02:45:36.768]  But they just sit back while stuff's wrecked and say, well, it all collapses.
[02:45:36.788 --> 02:45:38.068]  We'll just come in and buy it up anyways.
[02:45:38.088 --> 02:45:38.949]  But that's not what's going to happen.
[02:45:39.209 --> 02:45:40.929]  They want an angrier world where we blame each other.
[02:45:40.949 --> 02:45:41.790]  No, we're going to blame you.
[02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:44.451]  We're not going to have white people and black people kill each other like you want.
[02:45:45.171 --> 02:45:47.152]  I'm sure that's going to happen to some, but we're going to blame you.
[02:45:47.632 --> 02:45:48.493]  Well, it's not just that.
[02:45:48.573 --> 02:45:54.055]  If you actually look at exodus or mass movements in American history, it actually started out of American cities.
[02:45:54.435 --> 02:46:00.018]  When the Democrats took over the American cities around the 50s, there was a mass exodus and people started moving.
[02:46:00.118 --> 02:46:01.199]  They started moving to the counties.
[02:46:01.499 --> 02:46:02.239]  You look around St.
[02:46:02.279 --> 02:46:05.741]  Louis, Baltimore, Dallas, Chicago, everybody moves out of the city now.
[02:46:06.101 --> 02:46:10.323]  Well, now they can't even handle the state because it gets overwhelmed with a population dense cities.
[02:46:10.483 --> 02:46:11.384]  So they move out of the state.
[02:46:11.404 --> 02:46:14.285]  I mean, these people cause mass exodus everywhere they go.
[02:46:14.485 --> 02:46:16.506]  They'll do the whole country if they get power again.
[02:46:16.887 --> 02:46:17.307]  Damn right.
[02:46:17.347 --> 02:46:18.748]  Let's go back to Trump.
[02:46:18.908 --> 02:46:20.549]  And inflation destroyed them.
[02:46:21.329 --> 02:46:24.591]  And frankly, they were almost better off if they didn't do anything like that.
[02:46:24.611 --> 02:46:26.913]  I mean, those people have been absolutely decimated.
[02:46:27.333 --> 02:46:29.454]  And we're going to bring those people back and help those people.
[02:46:29.794 --> 02:46:31.375]  We've got to get the prices down.
[02:46:31.756 --> 02:46:36.819]  You know, when I look at bacon costing five, four or five times more than it did a few years ago.
[02:46:36.859 --> 02:46:38.640]  I just bought bacon for three bucks.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:39.801]  The cheap ones are ten now.
[02:46:40.401 --> 02:46:40.761]  I never guessed it.
[02:46:40.781 --> 02:46:41.722]  Eggs and steak is like all I eat?
[02:46:41.742 --> 02:46:42.423]  Probably up 50% since Trump?
[02:46:58.835 --> 02:47:02.036]  Yeah, five years ago, eggs were $3 a carton, they're like $10.
[02:47:02.216 --> 02:47:03.516]  It's crazy.
[02:47:03.636 --> 02:47:08.717]  I mean, I do the law of the grocery shop, but I went grocery shopping Sunday, I was like, Jesus Christ.
[02:47:08.757 --> 02:47:10.398]  Yeah, steak's insane too, same deal.
[02:47:10.478 --> 02:47:14.158]  People are gonna think I have all this money because the media lies.
[02:47:14.218 --> 02:47:16.879]  I'm just leaving the steak area alone, I'm getting a hamburger.
[02:47:16.979 --> 02:47:19.339]  I mean, cheap steak's like $20 a pound now.
[02:47:19.359 --> 02:47:20.460]  It used to be like $10.
[02:47:23.092 --> 02:47:24.754]  Oh, we got Owen having a few eggs here.
[02:47:25.014 --> 02:47:27.336]  He's chugging $400 worth of eggs in this video.
[02:47:27.356 --> 02:47:29.038]  Are you like Kim Walsh?
[02:47:29.098 --> 02:47:29.919]  Is that horse semen?
[02:47:30.479 --> 02:47:32.582]  I probably couldn't afford this in today's economy.
[02:47:33.102 --> 02:47:34.423]  I think that was a dozen eggs.
[02:47:34.984 --> 02:47:36.145]  A dozen horse semens.
[02:47:37.727 --> 02:47:44.794]  But yeah, man, steak and eggs, the staple of American diet, and the Democrats are going to price you out of it.
[02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:48.710]  You're like Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:52.691]  You put the whole egg in the blender and get the extra calcium.
[02:47:53.051 --> 02:47:56.752]  Well, see, I'm energy efficient, actually, and so I don't even plug the blender in.
[02:47:56.972 --> 02:47:57.412]  Look at that.
[02:47:57.452 --> 02:47:57.772]  Look at that.
[02:47:57.852 --> 02:47:59.513]  This is Governor Walz.
[02:47:59.773 --> 02:48:00.613]  This better be the good one.
[02:48:03.214 --> 02:48:04.454]  There goes Governor Walz.
[02:48:05.794 --> 02:48:11.616]  Actual footage of Governor Walz drinking horse salmon.
[02:48:13.176 --> 02:48:14.116]  I wouldn't want to see that.
[02:48:14.356 --> 02:48:14.997]  It's a joke.
[02:48:15.857 --> 02:48:16.757]  No one's attacking Owen.
[02:48:18.029 --> 02:48:18.409]  Look at that.
[02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:21.390]  That's what Walsh does after he's like, oh, that was good.
[02:48:21.930 --> 02:48:23.331]  Is that how Walsh gets his protein?
[02:48:24.111 --> 02:48:24.291]  Yeah.
[02:48:24.631 --> 02:48:25.512]  After football practice?
[02:48:25.632 --> 02:48:26.792]  It's only one thing better than eggs.
[02:48:27.192 --> 02:48:28.813]  He shows the amount of use of the tampon.
[02:48:29.733 --> 02:48:30.554]  Well, that's that.
[02:48:30.594 --> 02:48:30.814]  Yeah.
[02:48:31.914 --> 02:48:35.596]  He's got three tampons up his ass and five gallons of horse sand.
[02:48:36.776 --> 02:48:37.936]  All right, let's get back to Trump.
[02:48:37.977 --> 02:48:38.317]  Here we go.
[02:48:38.337 --> 02:48:39.457]  It's fake news.
[02:48:39.537 --> 02:48:44.539]  Came in from Wuhan, the Wuhan labs, and I always said it, and it turned out to be right.
[02:48:45.066 --> 02:48:50.389]  But had that not, had that not happened, we were set to start reducing debt.
[02:48:50.769 --> 02:48:54.171]  By the way, he doesn't really do that, but they want to say that J.D.
[02:48:54.211 --> 02:48:58.754]  Vance has sex with couches and wears eyeliner, so we'll just make up whatever we want to.
[02:48:59.234 --> 02:49:00.695]  The difference is, we'll tell you it's a joke.
[02:49:01.555 --> 02:49:10.840]  I think he does things far worse than... I mean, look, anybody who's wanting to show young boys with the tampons, I don't know.
[02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:12.041]  No, he goes soft on pedophiles.
[02:49:13.052 --> 02:49:14.415]  That's the legislation practice.
[02:49:14.695 --> 02:49:15.176]  Yep, here we go.
[02:49:25.441 --> 02:49:25.641]  Pipeline?
[02:49:25.661 --> 02:49:26.302]  Pipeline or horse semen.
[02:49:26.322 --> 02:49:27.542]  The new use for Keystone.
[02:49:27.562 --> 02:49:29.344]  A horse semen pipeline.
[02:49:29.384 --> 02:49:30.364]  Sorry, it's late, folks.
[02:49:30.444 --> 02:49:31.845]  We apologize.
[02:49:31.865 --> 02:49:33.866]  The point is, they want to make stuff up.
[02:49:33.906 --> 02:49:36.248]  We can make stuff up way worse, but we don't want to.
[02:49:36.288 --> 02:49:37.309]  So just keep playing games.
[02:49:52.227 --> 02:49:53.987]  Oh God, please don't defend your shots.
[02:49:54.007 --> 02:49:55.208]  This is the only downer with Trump.
[02:49:55.228 --> 02:49:57.488]  More people died because of the vaccine.
[02:49:57.668 --> 02:49:59.148]  Yeah, he's learned to shut up about it.
[02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:01.029]  Just give me a break, Trump.
[02:50:19.577 --> 02:50:21.337]  And the cult members are like, don't criticize him.
[02:50:21.398 --> 02:50:22.138]  No, I'm not in a cult.
[02:50:22.218 --> 02:50:23.178]  I love Trump.
[02:50:23.198 --> 02:50:23.898]  He's pig-headed.
[02:50:23.938 --> 02:50:24.798]  He won him and he's wrong.
[02:50:25.239 --> 02:50:26.479]  He tried all the therapeutics.
[02:50:26.499 --> 02:50:27.199]  They lied to him.
[02:50:27.539 --> 02:50:30.300]  But just don't, don't tell me how good the shots are.
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:32.681]  Just don't.
[02:50:32.761 --> 02:50:35.441]  He's not, he's not doing this.
[02:50:35.461 --> 02:50:36.462]  That's good.
[02:50:36.602 --> 02:50:39.822]  And it's like 99% of the deaths happened in hospitals.
[02:50:40.263 --> 02:50:41.803]  Yeah, please don't do it, Trump.
[02:50:41.823 --> 02:50:42.563]  I'm going to jump off a cliff here.
[02:50:46.001 --> 02:50:47.182]  We're good to go.
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:58.561]  At least you'd have plenty of tampons.
[02:50:58.581 --> 02:50:59.341]  Feeling nice and safe and secure now.
[02:50:59.461 --> 02:51:00.201]  I feel really good and clean.
[02:51:00.221 --> 02:51:01.042]  Biden might need a tampon.
[02:51:01.062 --> 02:51:01.782]  Maybe that's the reason.
[02:51:01.802 --> 02:51:03.903]  Am I discriminating the men's bathrooms here who don't have tampons?
[02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:27.473]  I don't know, who can I talk to around here because I actually feel like when I walk into the men's room and there's not a healthy supply of tampons that I'm being short of.
[02:51:27.493 --> 02:51:29.574]  Well this building is so old it's an old Microsoft building.
[02:51:29.654 --> 02:51:30.194]  I'm being short of.
[02:51:30.214 --> 02:51:31.955]  There's tampon dispensers in the women's bathrooms.
[02:51:32.970 --> 02:51:34.692]  Well, yeah, and not the men's.
[02:51:34.872 --> 02:51:36.434]  And do you realize how discriminatory that is?
[02:51:36.514 --> 02:51:41.460]  Yeah, and I'm actually, well, you probably shouldn't admit this on air, Alex, actually, because they're going to be coming for you now.
[02:51:42.642 --> 02:51:44.464]  Oh my God, I just committed a felony?
[02:51:45.345 --> 02:51:46.006]  Very offensive.
[02:51:46.046 --> 02:51:48.789]  Fine, we're putting tampon dispensers in the men's restroom tomorrow.
[02:51:49.290 --> 02:51:49.710]  That's right.
[02:51:52.583 --> 02:51:53.925]  What do you call a men's restroom in Snot?
[02:51:54.286 --> 02:51:58.932]  Well, actually, there are no gi, he, she, juror bathrooms here.
[02:51:59.232 --> 02:52:01.075]  Should there be horse semen dispensers?
[02:52:01.095 --> 02:52:03.698]  There are no transgender facilities here at all, Alex.
[02:52:03.718 --> 02:52:04.680]  Alright, let's go back to Trump.
[02:52:05.575 --> 02:52:16.085]  My view is like, we do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of, I mean, you run out of oil and gas.
[02:52:16.146 --> 02:52:18.528]  It's not infinite.
[02:52:18.788 --> 02:52:20.390]  There is some risk.
[02:52:20.470 --> 02:52:26.576]  I think it's not, the risk is not as high as, you know... No, definitely we need innovation.
[02:52:28.197 --> 02:52:29.278]  The innovation comes first.
[02:52:29.838 --> 02:52:32.779]  They didn't kill all the horses then invent the car.
[02:52:33.159 --> 02:52:35.340]  They invented the car and it replaced the horses naturally.
[02:52:35.460 --> 02:52:38.842]  Oh, you're back to Tim Waltz's favorite subject.
[02:52:38.882 --> 02:52:39.522]  No, you're right though.
[02:52:39.562 --> 02:52:42.063]  They're blocking all the real technology.
[02:52:42.684 --> 02:52:45.325]  You start getting headaches and nausea.
[02:52:45.345 --> 02:52:46.685]  Well, you see a horse semen engine.
[02:52:46.705 --> 02:52:48.466]  We're now in the sort of 400 range.
[02:52:48.806 --> 02:52:49.827]  We're adding, I think, about
[02:52:50.558 --> 02:52:50.858]  We're good.
[02:53:07.134 --> 02:53:08.035]  Yeah, like Tim Walsh.
[02:53:08.055 --> 02:53:10.057]  I was running from Tim Walsh.
[02:53:29.764 --> 02:53:30.785]  I'm trying to escape.
[02:53:31.245 --> 02:53:31.945]  Put that back on screen.
[02:53:31.985 --> 02:53:33.366]  You woke up one day, Alan.
[02:53:33.386 --> 02:53:34.787]  Tim Wall's in your stall.
[02:53:34.927 --> 02:53:36.508]  He was in my barn.
[02:53:36.528 --> 02:53:39.150]  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
[02:53:39.350 --> 02:53:42.051]  I don't know what he was doing, but I was gone.
[02:53:42.532 --> 02:53:43.132]  Out of feeling.
[02:53:43.152 --> 02:53:43.752]  A bad feeling.
[02:53:50.356 --> 02:53:52.318]  You know, much of it hasn't even been found yet.
[02:53:52.698 --> 02:53:52.878]  Yeah.
[02:53:52.918 --> 02:53:56.941]  But there are tremendous... Yeah, the oil wells filled back up.
[02:53:56.981 --> 02:54:00.864]  I wouldn't be surprised if someday we have a technology to even make oil.
[02:54:00.964 --> 02:54:08.809]  Look, if they come up with a solar panel that works right, the top of your car's solar panel, and my car's free, I'm going electric tomorrow.
[02:54:09.149 --> 02:54:10.530]  The damn batteries are toxic.
[02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:12.252]  And Elon, fine, make them, we get it.
[02:54:12.712 --> 02:54:16.455]  But just, at least he isn't... Elon said we've got to have fossil fuel as a bridge.
[02:54:17.315 --> 02:54:18.236]  But not a bridge to nowhere.
[02:54:20.285 --> 02:54:23.787]  We have a strategic oil supply, we need a strategic horse semen supply.
[02:54:23.807 --> 02:54:24.488]  For Tim Walz.
[02:54:24.528 --> 02:54:25.789]  He's gonna drain it like Biden.
[02:54:45.512 --> 02:54:46.952]  Perhaps hundreds of years left.
[02:54:47.012 --> 02:54:47.773]  Nobody really knows.
[02:54:48.113 --> 02:54:53.034]  But during that time, something will come around that will be very good.
[02:54:53.795 --> 02:54:58.856]  Well, I mean, my estimate would be, you know, a little more aggressive than that.
[02:54:58.896 --> 02:55:02.137]  But it's not the sort of like, we're all going to die in five years stuff.
[02:55:02.477 --> 02:55:03.478]  That's obviously BS.
[02:55:04.738 --> 02:55:13.241]  But my view is like, if you just look at sort of the positive million that increments every year, you know, you get sort of two or three positive million every year of CO2.
[02:55:14.537 --> 02:55:16.758]  It makes trees grow faster.
[02:55:16.979 --> 02:55:18.039]  The sea hasn't come up.
[02:55:18.119 --> 02:55:19.520]  It's bullcrap.
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:26.484]  Back when like possums weighed 400 pounds and armadillos weighed two tons, CO2 was like a hundred times higher.
[02:55:27.165 --> 02:55:27.805]  It's good.
[02:55:27.905 --> 02:55:28.626]  You want it.
[02:55:29.366 --> 02:55:31.247]  We end up like Mars.
[02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:32.368]  Thank God we found all this.
[02:55:32.428 --> 02:55:33.028]  God gave it to us.
[02:55:33.048 --> 02:55:35.630]  There's a lot of estimates we'd be losing the atmosphere right now.
[02:55:35.650 --> 02:55:36.610]  It's like right on time.
[02:55:36.951 --> 02:55:37.771]  We found all this.
[02:55:37.931 --> 02:55:38.912]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:55:43.128 --> 02:55:44.449]  Tim Walz found something else.
[02:55:44.569 --> 02:55:46.451]  Think about what you could do.
[02:55:46.491 --> 02:55:48.272]  I mean, you want to talk about energy efficiency.
[02:55:48.332 --> 02:55:53.737]  If you don't want to burn, quote-unquote, fossil fuels, which is a misnomer, but why not go nuclear?
[02:55:53.817 --> 02:55:55.718]  Where's the nuclear talk?
[02:55:55.759 --> 02:55:56.659]  Well, let's go back to this.
[02:55:56.759 --> 02:55:58.201]  I think we want to just move over.
[02:55:58.241 --> 02:55:59.602]  I don't know, 50 to 100 years from now, we're
[02:56:12.481 --> 02:56:22.304]  It's not like the house is on fire immediately, but I think it is something we need to move towards.
[02:56:22.724 --> 02:56:29.486]  And on balance, it's probably better to move there faster than slower.
[02:56:30.066 --> 02:56:38.209]  But like I said, without vilifying the oil and gas industry and without causing hardship in the short term, I think this can be done.
[02:56:41.533 --> 02:56:48.659]  People can still have a stake, and they can still drive gasoline cars.
[02:56:48.739 --> 02:56:49.479]  It's okay.
[02:56:49.539 --> 02:56:56.324]  I don't think we should vilify people for it, but I think we should just generally lean in the direction of sustainability.
[02:56:56.344 --> 02:57:06.492]  I actually think solar is going to be a majority of Earth's energy generation in the future, and it's certainly trending that way.
[02:57:07.441 --> 02:57:13.543]  And so you get the solar power with batteries, because obviously the sun doesn't shine at night.
[02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:19.444]  And then you use that to charge the electric cars, and you have a long-term sustainable solution.
[02:57:20.204 --> 02:57:24.965]  And that's what Tesla's trying to move things towards, and I think we've made a lot of progress in that regard.
[02:57:25.345 --> 02:57:27.906]  But when you look at our cars, we don't believe
[02:57:28.524 --> 02:57:32.447]  That environmentalism, that caring about the environment should mean that you have to suffer.
[02:57:32.868 --> 02:57:38.413]  So we make sure that our cars are beautiful, that they drive well, that they're fast, they're, you know, sexy.
[02:57:38.433 --> 02:57:39.233]  I mean, they're cool.
[02:57:39.273 --> 02:57:44.398]  In fact, literally, I mean, the sexy joke, Model S, Model 3, Model X and Y spells out sexy.
[02:57:44.458 --> 02:57:47.020]  It's probably the most expensive joke out there.
[02:57:47.941 --> 02:57:50.363]  But I, you know, I just, I don't know, I like cheesy humor, you know, so.
[02:57:52.164 --> 02:57:56.128]  But I'm a big fan of like, let's have an inspiring future.
[02:57:56.678 --> 02:57:57.579]  I agree.
[02:57:57.639 --> 02:57:58.540]  American futurism.
[02:57:58.820 --> 02:58:00.281]  You know, a better future.
[02:58:00.581 --> 02:58:02.683]  Like the actual futurism vision.
[02:58:02.743 --> 02:58:02.964]  Right.
[02:58:02.984 --> 02:58:05.586]  You know, it's very interesting.
[02:58:05.946 --> 02:58:14.594]  You use the word global warming and today they use the word climate change because, you know, you have some places that go up and so they were getting themselves in a little trouble.
[02:58:14.714 --> 02:58:17.556]  The buses go here, the buses go there.
[02:58:17.596 --> 02:58:19.378]  Some places are going the opposite direction.
[02:58:20.642 --> 02:58:25.506]  You know, I'm sort of waiting for you to come up with solar panels on the roofs of your cars.
[02:58:25.806 --> 02:58:27.608]  I just said that.
[02:58:27.648 --> 02:58:31.190]  It just seems like something that at some point you will come up with.
[02:58:31.210 --> 02:58:32.531]  You gotta get a better solar panel.
[02:58:32.811 --> 02:58:33.892]  It's getting there.
[02:58:34.052 --> 02:58:35.593]  And so I'm all about it.
[02:58:35.613 --> 02:58:37.655]  But it needs a decentralized government power.
[02:58:37.735 --> 02:58:39.977]  I want it on the top of my house or on the car.
[02:58:42.449 --> 02:58:43.470]  They already got it.
[02:58:43.651 --> 02:58:44.552]  I've talked to people, they've got it.
[02:58:44.572 --> 02:58:46.474]  They were concepting that back in the 90s.
[02:58:46.514 --> 02:58:48.116]  They had solar powered cars.
[02:58:48.637 --> 02:58:51.100]  It's like the guy in Brazil got the cure for cancer, they blow his airplane up.
[02:58:51.341 --> 02:58:51.501]  Yeah.
[02:58:51.801 --> 02:58:52.943]  I mean, they got it.
[02:58:54.531 --> 02:58:55.031]  I got all of it.
[02:58:55.071 --> 02:59:01.135]  My dad was like in a government project out of high school, in high school, and they already had CD-ROMs 25 years before they were out.
[02:59:01.736 --> 02:59:02.776]  So I mean... The answer is what?
[02:59:02.796 --> 02:59:07.659]  A trillion dollar industry for the... Yeah, they don't want the cures out there.
[02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:10.001]  Because these elites stay in power.
[02:59:10.681 --> 02:59:11.722]  They're in the way of progress.
[02:59:11.782 --> 02:59:13.023]  Instead, we're living less now.
[02:59:13.463 --> 02:59:16.785]  And the world population is actually going down now because they're murdering us.
[02:59:16.805 --> 02:59:17.806]  Let's go back to Trump.
[02:59:18.086 --> 02:59:20.308]  And again, we're going to go and join Nick...
[02:59:21.064 --> 02:59:23.266]  We'll be taking your comments coming up.
[02:59:23.286 --> 02:59:23.927]  Back to Trump.
[02:59:42.017 --> 02:59:44.259]  Let me just say this.
[02:59:44.299 --> 02:59:49.363]  Can you imagine Kamala on here for hours?
[02:59:50.084 --> 02:59:54.868]  She would be like repeating the same idiotic stuff and could not even talk.
[02:59:55.369 --> 02:59:57.010]  She's just giving a script.
[02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.891]  Here, sweetheart.
[02:59:58.652 --> 03:00:00.633]  Meanwhile, Trump's meandering all over the place.
[03:00:00.653 --> 03:00:02.355]  You're actually hearing the real guy.
[03:00:02.895 --> 03:00:03.776]  Say what you want about him.
[03:00:03.816 --> 03:00:04.657]  This is a real dude.
[03:00:07.742 --> 03:00:08.783]  No, this is a real conversation.
[03:00:08.923 --> 03:00:13.748]  I mean, we're basically just listening in to the conversation of the most powerful men in the world.
[03:00:14.029 --> 03:00:15.851]  I don't say this to name drop, but when Trump...
[03:00:18.123 --> 03:00:18.543]  Call me.
[03:00:18.583 --> 03:00:20.285]  He's always like, how's your family?
[03:00:20.765 --> 03:00:21.486]  What's going on?
[03:00:21.666 --> 03:00:23.387]  And I'm like, I don't want to talk about me.
[03:00:23.928 --> 03:00:25.649]  Let's talk about how you got traitors in your administration.
[03:00:25.669 --> 03:00:27.631]  He's like, well, okay, tell me.
[03:00:27.671 --> 03:00:29.992]  But then he kind of gets, okay, I'm taking notes.
[03:00:30.353 --> 03:00:31.454]  And I would flip out over it.
[03:00:31.494 --> 03:00:34.476]  But he thinks of himself in charge, which is great.
[03:00:34.776 --> 03:00:36.478]  He's calling you to make you feel good.
[03:00:36.518 --> 03:00:37.939]  It's not even a pat on the head.
[03:00:37.979 --> 03:00:38.819]  He's trying to give energy.
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:40.020]  To people.
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:43.403]  Because that's the thing that's free is a leader giving people love.
[03:00:43.824 --> 03:00:46.145]  He sees that as currency that he's printing when he does it.
[03:00:46.446 --> 03:00:47.507]  Hundreds of calls a day.
[03:00:47.527 --> 03:00:51.870]  And so he would call other foreign leaders and companies and say, bring your jobs here.
[03:00:52.210 --> 03:00:54.512]  They would do it because CEOs don't get presidents calling.
[03:00:54.853 --> 03:00:54.953]  Right.
[03:00:55.413 --> 03:00:58.755]  And then France said, hey, we're not going to let your dishwashers in here.
[03:00:59.115 --> 03:01:02.336]  Trump said, fine, 100% tariff on wine next week.
[03:01:02.717 --> 03:01:04.057]  Oh, great, we'll let your dishwashers in.
[03:01:04.317 --> 03:01:07.439]  And suddenly we were doubling dishwasher sales because Europe let it in.
[03:01:07.859 --> 03:01:08.780]  It's real simple.
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:10.541]  They're not working for us, folks.
[03:01:11.001 --> 03:01:11.981]  That's what Trump's explaining.
[03:01:12.041 --> 03:01:13.122]  It's so easy.
[03:01:13.602 --> 03:01:15.503]  Like, he's like, we'll buy French dishwashers.
[03:01:15.783 --> 03:01:17.064]  We'll buy German dishwashers.
[03:01:17.404 --> 03:01:18.344]  We'll buy German cars.
[03:01:18.485 --> 03:01:20.085]  But not if you don't let us in the market.
[03:01:21.006 --> 03:01:22.547]  He told the Japanese, let our shit in.
[03:01:22.787 --> 03:01:23.107]  They did.
[03:01:24.192 --> 03:01:24.733]  We're good to go.
[03:01:40.776 --> 03:01:44.058]  But the globalists think that it's quaint, like, oh, he's a guy who cares about a country.
[03:01:45.179 --> 03:01:46.279]  Well, what else is there?
[03:01:46.719 --> 03:01:49.121]  Now you're just bankers in BlackRock who don't care about themselves.
[03:01:49.141 --> 03:01:51.262]  They go, oh, a country, it's so quaint and old.
[03:01:51.502 --> 03:01:52.423]  Well, what else is there?
[03:01:53.063 --> 03:01:55.925]  That's why our founders said, God gives us our rights.
[03:01:55.985 --> 03:02:00.047]  Even if you don't believe in God, it's coming from God so they can't override that.
[03:02:00.487 --> 03:02:02.509]  So it's like if you have a nation, that overrides it too.
[03:02:02.529 --> 03:02:02.969]  Sorry, Owen.
[03:02:03.009 --> 03:02:09.473]  Well, to them, to the corporatists, the next level is centralized, centralized, centralized, a globalization.
[03:02:09.493 --> 03:02:10.193]  Global government.
[03:02:10.333 --> 03:02:12.774]  A globalization and then a centralized source of power.
[03:02:13.794 --> 03:02:21.697]  So the antithesis to that, which is why Musk and Trump gravitate together, is the individual is empowered by technology.
[03:02:21.737 --> 03:02:24.458]  The individual is empowered by innovation.
[03:02:24.478 --> 03:02:29.460]  Yeah, we don't need a central UN saying, you're going to buy an electric car, we're going to make it so badass you want it.
[03:02:30.185 --> 03:02:31.405]  Which is innovation, which is fine with me.
[03:02:31.726 --> 03:02:36.567]  It's the actual envisionment of what we thought the future would be like.
[03:02:36.668 --> 03:02:51.313]  Flying vehicles, anti-gravity, free energy, versus everything centralized and what you get access to is dictated from a global corptocracy so far away, faceless, nameless, and it can- And they ban all the stuff that worked like your rain stuff.
[03:02:52.554 --> 03:02:54.394]  It works great, why get rid of it?
[03:02:55.295 --> 03:02:58.156]  And once I get some solar panel that does it better, but it's not.
[03:02:59.155 --> 03:02:59.736]  Great point, Alan.
[03:02:59.756 --> 03:03:01.898]  Let's go back to Trump.
[03:03:02.038 --> 03:03:08.545]  Yeah, Trump should be talking about his persecution more.
[03:03:08.605 --> 03:03:10.307]  But it shows what an optimist he is.
[03:03:10.327 --> 03:03:11.629]  He's not even talking about himself, Harrison.
[03:03:13.976 --> 03:03:16.679]  Well, he's got the classic sense of noblesse oblige, right?
[03:03:16.699 --> 03:03:17.820]  The obligation of the nobles.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:27.729]  The idea, back when you had nobles, was like, alright, you get to live in a castle, you get to be fed, you don't have to work, but when the invasion comes, it's your ass in the armor with the sword going out and putting your life on the line to defend us.
[03:03:27.929 --> 03:03:28.810]  It was an obligation.
[03:03:28.850 --> 03:03:29.911]  The nobles got all these privileges.
[03:03:29.931 --> 03:03:30.331]  Exactly.
[03:03:30.391 --> 03:03:32.914]  You can be an aristocrat, which means you lead from the front.
[03:03:33.254 --> 03:03:33.454]  Right.
[03:03:33.614 --> 03:03:36.696]  And so now, the people in power now, the elites... Say that again in French.
[03:03:37.117 --> 03:03:38.538]  Noblesse Oblige.
[03:03:38.598 --> 03:03:39.038]  Or Latin.
[03:03:39.818 --> 03:03:40.479]  I don't even know.
[03:03:40.499 --> 03:03:41.099]  I think it's Latin.
[03:03:41.159 --> 03:03:42.800]  But yeah, it's the obligation of the nobles.
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:50.345]  It's the obligation the nobles are supposed to feel for the people under them because, you know, when it was the King of England and he had all the power, if England did well, he did well.
[03:03:50.385 --> 03:03:53.627]  It was just, you know, he had no incentive to not to sell out his country.
[03:03:53.647 --> 03:03:55.889]  And as soon as they quit doing that, things got corrupt.
[03:03:56.169 --> 03:03:57.871]  Yeah, because, you know... You're right.
[03:03:58.072 --> 03:03:59.614]  That's why George Washington left for the front.
[03:03:59.694 --> 03:04:00.635]  He was expected.
[03:04:00.675 --> 03:04:02.157]  He wasn't a king, but he was that archetype.
[03:04:02.558 --> 03:04:03.599]  He had to leave for the front.
[03:04:03.639 --> 03:04:04.901]  He's like, I'm not going to do this.
[03:04:05.161 --> 03:04:09.247]  I'm not going to charge the Hessians at Trenton, the Germans, and not be up front.
[03:04:09.487 --> 03:04:12.692]  Yeah, and so now the bankers and the elite that control things now
[03:04:12.892 --> 03:04:13.252]  God, you hit it.
[03:04:13.272 --> 03:04:14.113]  That's exactly what it's all about.
[03:04:30.529 --> 03:04:32.210]  And they demand their respect, too.
[03:04:32.290 --> 03:04:38.574]  Like, when you would have rivaling tribes or fiefdoms or kingdoms, the king would ride on his horse in front, right?
[03:04:38.694 --> 03:04:41.355]  The tribe leader, the chief, would ride on his horse in front.
[03:04:41.775 --> 03:04:43.757]  And so they would earn the respect.
[03:04:43.937 --> 03:04:44.897]  Right.
[03:04:44.917 --> 03:04:48.779]  Now, these people want to sit in Ivory Tower, sit in Washington, D.C., sit in the Pentagon.
[03:04:48.799 --> 03:04:49.860]  With no skin in the game.
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:50.560]  None at all.
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.822]  Send others' kids to die.
[03:04:53.622 --> 03:04:56.924]  And expect to get the respect just because they're there.
[03:04:57.004 --> 03:04:59.266]  And now they're trying to make robots in to replace the humans.
[03:04:59.306 --> 03:05:00.567]  It's the anti-chivalry.
[03:05:01.187 --> 03:05:01.787]  Let's go back to Trump.
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:09.843]  San Francisco liberal who destroyed San Francisco and then as Attorney General, she destroyed California.
[03:05:10.424 --> 03:05:13.925]  You talk about location and we're talking about the sun and the water and all.
[03:05:14.466 --> 03:05:16.366]  There's nothing better than California.
[03:05:16.747 --> 03:05:18.007]  She has destroyed that.
[03:05:18.047 --> 03:05:19.648]  She was the original DA.
[03:05:19.708 --> 03:05:22.069]  She was the original in San Francisco.
[03:05:22.089 --> 03:05:24.110]  She was the original Attorney General in California.
[03:05:24.530 --> 03:05:31.694]  What she has done to California is, well, you know better than I do, you just left California for a lot of those reasons.
[03:05:32.287 --> 03:05:38.556]  And what he's done with crime, with cashless bail, where you kill somebody.
[03:05:38.596 --> 03:05:42.060]  I mean, we have states there, you kill somebody and they let you out right away.
[03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:47.428]  I mean, you don't have to even put up and then they never find the people unless they kill again and then they let them out again.
[03:05:48.673 --> 03:06:02.376]  Our country is becoming a very dangerous place, and she is a radical left San Francisco liberal, and now she's trying to protect, now she's looking like she wants to be more Trump than Trump, if that's possible.
[03:06:02.396 --> 03:06:03.356]  I don't think it's possible.
[03:06:03.716 --> 03:06:05.796]  But she wants to be more Trump than Trump.
[03:06:06.176 --> 03:06:07.257]  I want a wall.
[03:06:07.377 --> 03:06:12.978]  She wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention, and some of these guys are really bad.
[03:06:13.098 --> 03:06:14.338]  That just came out today.
[03:06:15.078 --> 03:06:18.179]  He doesn't want to build the wall, even though the walls work.
[03:06:18.279 --> 03:06:19.100]  Walls and wheels.
[03:06:19.420 --> 03:06:21.881]  You know, in your business, everything you do is obsolete.
[03:06:22.461 --> 03:06:24.782]  Not the tunnels, but everything is obsolete.
[03:06:24.882 --> 03:06:26.122]  Even your rocket ships.
[03:06:26.642 --> 03:06:28.263]  Like a month later, they're obsolete.
[03:06:28.283 --> 03:06:32.124]  You find a better way to... The only thing that's not obsolete is a wall and a wheel.
[03:06:32.825 --> 03:06:38.907]  And the wall, you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall, and that's why we had such good numbers.
[03:06:39.545 --> 03:06:41.247]  I was going to add 200 miles.
[03:06:41.767 --> 03:06:42.308]  We bought it.
[03:06:42.388 --> 03:06:45.211]  We could have flipped it, flipped it up in three weeks.
[03:06:45.791 --> 03:06:48.034]  And they sold it for five cents on the dollar.
[03:06:48.815 --> 03:06:52.556]  That meant, I said, wow, that means that they actually do want to have open borders.
[03:06:52.976 --> 03:06:57.698]  She wants to have open borders and now she's going like she's tough on the border.
[03:06:58.398 --> 03:06:59.339]  It's such a lie.
[03:06:59.419 --> 03:07:01.719]  And she wants tips to be tax free.
[03:07:01.739 --> 03:07:05.741]  When she wrote the law to rip off workers, service workers.
[03:07:05.761 --> 03:07:06.621]  She can't make this up.
[03:07:12.884 --> 03:07:13.144]  I don't
[03:07:28.536 --> 03:07:30.777]  Very quickly, you're not going to have a country anymore.
[03:07:31.017 --> 03:07:33.578]  And she'll go back to all of the things that she believes in.
[03:07:33.918 --> 03:07:35.659]  She believes in defunding the police.
[03:07:36.079 --> 03:07:37.499]  She believes in no fracking.
[03:07:37.639 --> 03:07:38.640]  Zero.
[03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:44.662]  Now all of a sudden she's saying, no, I really want to see fracking.
[03:07:45.242 --> 03:07:48.583]  If they got in, the day she got in, she'll end fracking.
[03:07:48.963 --> 03:07:55.526]  And by the way, if people didn't think that, the lunatics that really believe in that, they won't vote for her.
[03:07:57.026 --> 03:07:59.790]  Like, like the Palestinians and Israel.
[03:08:00.291 --> 03:08:03.175]  She is so anti-Israel.
[03:08:03.215 --> 03:08:04.197]  And she's bad for both.
[03:08:04.477 --> 03:08:06.700]  Biden actually did something that was impossible.
[03:08:07.041 --> 03:08:08.423]  Both sides hate him.
[03:08:08.763 --> 03:08:09.745]  You know, both sides.
[03:08:10.065 --> 03:08:11.187]  That was a hard thing to do.
[03:08:11.327 --> 03:08:11.988]  Unification.
[03:08:14.178 --> 03:08:14.679]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:08:14.739 --> 03:08:17.782]  I mean, folks, we already have cancer cures.
[03:08:18.022 --> 03:08:19.443]  We already have free energy.
[03:08:19.683 --> 03:08:21.145]  Get out of the way, Obama.
[03:08:21.265 --> 03:08:22.666]  Get out of the way, Rockefeller.
[03:08:23.227 --> 03:08:24.168]  Move, bitch.
[03:08:24.328 --> 03:08:25.309]  Get out the way.
[03:08:25.649 --> 03:08:26.630]  Get out the way, bitch.
[03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:27.551]  Move out the way.
[03:08:28.672 --> 03:08:29.453]  He's black.
[03:08:29.533 --> 03:08:30.194]  Oh, he's cool.
[03:08:30.254 --> 03:08:31.094]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:08:31.235 --> 03:08:32.276]  It's all bullshit.
[03:08:35.296 --> 03:08:38.019]  A person that, you know, is a very pro-Israel.
[03:08:38.599 --> 03:08:41.462]  If you vote for her, it's worse than Biden.
[03:08:41.862 --> 03:08:42.663]  And Biden was bad.
[03:08:42.943 --> 03:08:45.466]  But if you vote for her, you ought to have your head examined.
[03:08:46.146 --> 03:08:55.035]  And you see tonight, I mean, as we're doing this, I'm seeing reports coming that they expect an attack tonight or tomorrow from hundreds and maybe thousands of rockets.
[03:08:55.535 --> 03:09:00.420]  You know, their Iron Dome, as they call it, as we all call it, but their shield that they built.
[03:09:01.716 --> 03:09:06.802]  Well, we're busy talking about Iran and Israel, which is important.
[03:09:07.142 --> 03:09:07.943]  We wish for peace.
[03:09:09.184 --> 03:09:15.551]  Six days ago, Ukraine, under NATO command, as Jack Wasabic predicted six months ago, by the way, get Jack Wasabic on tomorrow.
[03:09:17.233 --> 03:09:20.175]  Rampaged into Russia and it's just blowing up cities right now.
[03:09:20.635 --> 03:09:22.096]  Trying to get Russia into full war.
[03:09:22.156 --> 03:09:23.077]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:09:23.097 --> 03:09:24.077]  You guys want to comment on that?
[03:09:24.438 --> 03:09:28.700]  Well, Biden originally said F-16s to Ukraine equals World War III.
[03:09:29.121 --> 03:09:31.702]  And then three years later, he sent F-16s to Ukraine.
[03:09:31.842 --> 03:09:32.143]  Oh, did he?
[03:09:32.163 --> 03:09:34.384]  Because as far as I know, he's laying on the beach somewhere.
[03:09:34.404 --> 03:09:35.805]  So who knows who's orchestrating all this?
[03:09:35.825 --> 03:09:36.565]  He's napping on the beach.
[03:09:36.605 --> 03:09:38.206]  Well, they even admit that no one's in charge.
[03:09:38.226 --> 03:09:38.987]  Who is in charge?
[03:09:39.127 --> 03:09:40.048]  No, that's the disturbing part.
[03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:48.018]  Biden is literally laying on the beach while Iran and Israel are gearing up for World War and Ukraine is pushing the button, poking the bear with Russia.
[03:09:48.158 --> 03:09:48.699]  It's horrifying.
[03:09:49.159 --> 03:09:50.741]  We don't have any idea who's in charge.
[03:09:50.921 --> 03:09:51.702]  Lloyd Austin, I guess.
[03:09:52.183 --> 03:09:53.124]  Biden's taking a snooze.
[03:09:53.184 --> 03:09:55.467]  Well, some of the crews have been here since 6am.
[03:09:55.607 --> 03:09:58.531]  You guys cool to keep going a little while and take some calls on X?
[03:10:01.348 --> 03:10:02.869]  All right, they're good to go.
[03:10:03.309 --> 03:10:05.610]  Well, Trump got on 45 minutes late.
[03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:07.251]  He's been going for what?
[03:10:07.591 --> 03:10:08.892]  An hour and 20-30 minutes?
[03:10:10.312 --> 03:10:11.193]  He's been going since what?
[03:10:12.153 --> 03:10:13.314]  I guess he got on at about 7.40?
[03:10:13.834 --> 03:10:17.756]  So he's been going an hour and 30 minutes.
[03:10:19.297 --> 03:10:20.737]  He'll probably keep going a little bit longer.
[03:10:20.757 --> 03:10:25.720]  This has been great, but I really want to take the space as commenters with Nick Sordor.
[03:10:28.041 --> 03:10:29.021]  Chase, you're in there running that.
[03:10:29.061 --> 03:10:30.622]  When has Sordor launched his thing yet?
[03:10:32.580 --> 03:10:36.886]  Yeah, his space is live, but I don't think that they're taking speakers until this is over.
[03:10:36.986 --> 03:10:37.927]  And you're on air right now, right?
[03:10:38.047 --> 03:10:38.248]  Yeah.
[03:10:38.628 --> 03:10:43.254]  Okay, because I don't want people just to, I love you, I don't want to be, anybody in my ear, nobody hears, I want everybody.
[03:10:43.274 --> 03:10:44.937]  Yeah, that was live, that was live.
[03:10:44.957 --> 03:10:45.617]  You're live, okay, good.
[03:10:46.223 --> 03:10:47.384]  I want zero.
[03:10:47.404 --> 03:10:48.946]  Everybody hear everything?
[03:10:49.727 --> 03:10:51.128]  This is all about teleprompter free.
[03:10:51.148 --> 03:10:51.548]  Great job.
[03:10:51.889 --> 03:10:52.930]  Okay, let's go back to Trump.
[03:10:52.970 --> 03:10:56.874]  We'll sit here and wait, and then we'll, as soon as Sorter does that, we'll simulcast with him.
[03:10:56.914 --> 03:10:57.254]  Go ahead.
[03:10:58.175 --> 03:11:00.438]  For the good of the country, this election.
[03:11:00.918 --> 03:11:02.239]  I mean, that's understating my opinion.
[03:11:03.381 --> 03:11:08.426]  Now, you know, you may have seen this, but I got a letter from the
[03:11:09.235 --> 03:11:16.881]  The EU Commission, like saying, you know, to not have disinformation during this discussion that we're having.
[03:11:16.921 --> 03:11:17.101]  Yeah.
[03:11:17.462 --> 03:11:25.829]  And, you know, there's a lot of attempts to do censorship and to force censorship, even on Americans from other countries.
[03:11:26.089 --> 03:11:28.871]  And, you know, what do you think about that?
[03:11:29.432 --> 03:11:32.594]  Well, I know the European Union very well.
[03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:34.115]  Yeah, what are you going to do, Trump, about these people?
[03:11:34.135 --> 03:11:37.098]  They take great advantage of the United States in trade, as you know.
[03:11:37.941 --> 03:11:42.223]  We, through a different form, NATO, we protect them.
[03:11:42.903 --> 03:11:47.646]  And yet, if you build a car in the United States, you can't sell it in Europe.
[03:11:47.666 --> 03:11:48.726]  You just can't sell it.
[03:11:48.966 --> 03:11:49.767]  It's impossible.
[03:11:50.587 --> 03:11:51.868]  The same thing with our farmers.
[03:11:51.948 --> 03:11:54.109]  Our farmers find it very difficult to do business.
[03:11:54.129 --> 03:11:59.611]  You know, we have a deficit with them of $250 billion, which people don't know.
[03:11:59.631 --> 03:12:06.074]  It sounds so nice, the European Union, but let me tell you, they're not as tough as China, but they're bad.
[03:12:06.154 --> 03:12:07.195]  And I let them know it.
[03:12:08.170 --> 03:12:10.132]  And that's probably why they notified you.
[03:12:10.432 --> 03:12:12.594]  No, they don't treat our country well.
[03:12:13.114 --> 03:12:14.035]  We defend them.
[03:12:14.555 --> 03:12:22.581]  You know, with Ukraine, so we're in for $250 billion and they're in for about $71 billion and they have the same size.
[03:12:23.062 --> 03:12:28.606]  If you add up the European nations in terms of an economy, it's about the same size, wouldn't you say, as us.
[03:12:29.286 --> 03:12:34.090]  And they're in much greater risk.
[03:12:34.791 --> 03:12:35.491]  They're right there.
[03:12:35.791 --> 03:12:37.553]  We have an ocean separating us from
[03:12:38.584 --> 03:12:40.345]  In this case, the enemy would be Russia.
[03:12:40.805 --> 03:12:44.427]  Used to be for the Soviet Union, but let's assume they're close enough.
[03:12:44.987 --> 03:12:52.550]  What happens is they're in for 70-something million, I think even less than that, billion.
[03:12:53.111 --> 03:12:58.173]  We're in for about $250 billion, and it could be a lot higher than that.
[03:12:59.099 --> 03:13:00.760]  And I say, why aren't you going to equalize?
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:03.401]  Why aren't they paying what we're paying?
[03:13:03.822 --> 03:13:08.564]  And they're in much more, you know, they're, it's much more important for them because of the fact that, you know, they're right.
[03:13:08.684 --> 03:13:10.765]  Because it keeps the dollar in charge, Trump.
[03:13:10.846 --> 03:13:13.787]  And you know that, but it's all bullshit anyways.
[03:13:14.107 --> 03:13:15.648]  They should, and I did it with NATO.
[03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:21.752]  We were, there were only seven countries that were paid up in NATO out of 28 at the time.
[03:13:22.532 --> 03:13:27.815]  And the United States, the United States was subsidizing NATO.
[03:13:28.493 --> 03:13:29.835]  All right, so we've heard this.
[03:13:29.855 --> 03:13:30.736]  We'll go back to it when he's done.
[03:13:30.776 --> 03:13:33.239]  Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer, Chase Geyser, you want to make comments?
[03:13:44.813 --> 03:13:47.495]  No, I'm glad they're hammering the UK thing.
[03:13:47.535 --> 03:13:48.735]  I'm glad they're hammering the Iran thing.
[03:13:48.755 --> 03:13:53.178]  I mean, this is, for someone like me, I mean, 2016, this was my stance.
[03:13:53.218 --> 03:13:54.919]  It was Trump is the anti-war candidate.
[03:13:54.999 --> 03:13:55.979]  Nobody could argue against me.
[03:13:55.999 --> 03:13:57.400]  You know, they'd say, well, you're voting for Trump.
[03:13:57.420 --> 03:13:57.921]  How dare you?
[03:13:57.941 --> 03:13:58.321]  Why would you?
[03:13:58.361 --> 03:14:01.182]  I'd say, I don't like war, and Hillary's going to get us into war.
[03:14:01.222 --> 03:14:01.663]  Trump's not.
[03:14:01.943 --> 03:14:03.284]  And people would have to agree.
[03:14:03.324 --> 03:14:05.185]  They'd nod and go, OK, well, I guess that's good reason.
[03:14:05.645 --> 03:14:06.486]  He should be hammering.
[03:14:06.686 --> 03:14:08.126]  He is the anti-war president.
[03:14:08.166 --> 03:14:09.067]  He is the anti-war president.
[03:14:09.087 --> 03:14:10.328]  He is, and there was no wars.
[03:14:11.268 --> 03:14:14.570]  Other than him backing Russia and cleaning out ISIS, which was Western.
[03:14:14.971 --> 03:14:19.353]  Guys, queue up that Leanne McAdoo promo for when Trump got elected 2016.
[03:14:20.254 --> 03:14:21.995]  Now, gosh, so many years ago.
[03:14:22.015 --> 03:14:23.776]  Seems like a million years ago, eight years ago.
[03:14:24.317 --> 03:14:28.960]  That little promo about nuclear war with Hillary saying we will attack Russia, we will attack Iran.
[03:14:29.060 --> 03:14:29.220]  Owen?
[03:14:29.909 --> 03:14:40.858]  Well I agree, and I think war, when we talk about all these things that are being held back from civilization's next advancement, which will empower the individual, war is one of those biggest things.
[03:14:41.699 --> 03:14:48.224]  And the Western world, and this is why I've made the argument at this point, specifically after what we've seen in the Middle East,
[03:14:49.145 --> 03:14:53.626]  And you can talk about Israel's influence over our Congress, our government.
[03:14:54.066 --> 03:14:58.188]  You can talk about Muslim influence over other individuals or other governments.
[03:14:58.228 --> 03:15:05.830]  The point is, the Western world, the Christian world, specifically the United States of America, we have to completely decouple from the Middle East.
[03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:08.971]  Just completely remove ourselves from the Middle East.
[03:15:09.191 --> 03:15:12.972]  Not any foreign policy, not any interventions, nothing.
[03:15:13.712 --> 03:15:15.533]  Because that's holding us back.
[03:15:15.893 --> 03:15:19.755]  We spend hundreds of billions of dollars on these foreign wars.
[03:15:19.835 --> 03:15:21.456]  A trillion plus in Afghanistan.
[03:15:21.676 --> 03:15:22.397]  I mean, it's crazy.
[03:15:22.997 --> 03:15:24.318]  It doesn't do anything for us.
[03:15:24.338 --> 03:15:25.739]  It's literally just a sucker.
[03:15:26.039 --> 03:15:27.019]  It's a black hole.
[03:15:27.159 --> 03:15:29.941]  And they want to sit here and talk about how Tim Walz
[03:15:30.621 --> 03:15:31.382]  Absolutely.
[03:15:31.522 --> 03:15:31.862]  Well said.
[03:15:32.162 --> 03:15:33.003]  Let's go back to Trump.
[03:16:00.873 --> 03:16:01.614]  No, he wouldn't have this.
[03:16:01.674 --> 03:16:02.114]  That's true.
[03:16:02.274 --> 03:16:06.057]  Not a lot of people would have this conversation, but you know, we cover a lot of territory.
[03:16:06.878 --> 03:16:14.304]  But the beauty is that you, you know, we can have a conversation and I'm able to get it out without, because I get to meet him.
[03:16:14.324 --> 03:16:15.665]  This is a really big point.
[03:16:15.865 --> 03:16:18.567]  You can actually have a conversation with you.
[03:16:18.647 --> 03:16:19.488]  Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
[03:16:19.568 --> 03:16:21.549]  And you can't have a conversation with Biden or Kamala.
[03:16:21.569 --> 03:16:23.271]  It's like not, it's not possible.
[03:16:23.311 --> 03:16:24.431]  Because they can't talk.
[03:16:24.892 --> 03:16:25.793]  I said that earlier.
[03:16:25.813 --> 03:16:28.354]  This is like talking to an NPC, so it's just impossible.
[03:16:28.395 --> 03:16:28.955]  But think of it.
[03:16:29.295 --> 03:16:30.056]  We need a man.
[03:16:31.105 --> 03:16:38.207]  Or person who's unbelievably sharp in order to stop all the nuclear danger and all the dangers that I'm talking about.
[03:16:38.747 --> 03:16:41.328]  And I got along with all these, you know, I got along with Kim Jong-un.
[03:16:41.368 --> 03:16:43.729]  We had dinner, we had everything.
[03:16:43.909 --> 03:16:51.251]  Yeah, they need to debate Kamala Harris because, you know, everybody went along with the Biden is fine lie until the debate happened and then everybody had to acknowledge it.
[03:16:51.471 --> 03:16:53.431]  She can barely read off a teleprompter.
[03:16:53.691 --> 03:16:54.972]  She's dodging debates now.
[03:16:55.032 --> 03:16:56.832]  She's going to do one idiot.
[03:16:57.152 --> 03:16:58.893]  But we had a good relationship.
[03:16:59.514 --> 03:17:02.180]  And he doesn't like Biden.
[03:17:02.220 --> 03:17:04.304]  He considers him a stupid man, he said.
[03:17:04.324 --> 03:17:05.186]  He's a stupid man.
[03:17:05.226 --> 03:17:05.787]  I really hate him.
[03:17:05.947 --> 03:17:07.050]  At least he speaks his mind.
[03:17:07.869 --> 03:17:08.630]  I do, I do.
[03:17:08.690 --> 03:17:16.135]  I know, but I... I think it takes years off my life every time I look at her.
[03:17:16.155 --> 03:17:16.815]  No, it's funny you say that.
[03:17:16.835 --> 03:17:20.658]  She's like, she actually is like the queen in Snow White.
[03:17:20.698 --> 03:17:21.278]  She really is.
[03:17:21.438 --> 03:17:24.741]  She shows up to San Francisco, steals its power, destroys it.
[03:17:24.761 --> 03:17:26.061]  Puts all the black people in jail.
[03:17:26.282 --> 03:17:37.189]  Goes to California, steals its power, leaves it, goes to the White House, steals its power, leaves it behind, and then looks in the mirror and says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most powerful woman of them all?
[03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:42.852]  And the mirror says, you are not the most powerful, and so she's got to have more.
[03:17:42.892 --> 03:17:44.113]  She's got to be the president now.
[03:17:44.913 --> 03:17:46.494]  She's like, you're not the most powerful.
[03:17:46.514 --> 03:17:47.294]  She ages you guys.
[03:17:47.334 --> 03:17:49.956]  You know who hates Kamala Harris more than any of us is Hillary Clinton.
[03:17:51.116 --> 03:17:54.698]  You know Hillary Clinton's sitting there going, you know how many people I had to kill to get to where I was?
[03:17:54.758 --> 03:17:55.879]  And Kamala just waltzes in.
[03:17:55.899 --> 03:17:56.379]  That's a good point.
[03:17:56.399 --> 03:17:59.901]  Well, she had another movie that she put on to get to where she's at.
[03:17:59.941 --> 03:18:01.682]  Kamala said, well, maybe you should have just taken my route.
[03:18:01.702 --> 03:18:02.403]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:03.323 --> 03:18:04.263]  Trump's great and I love him.
[03:18:04.823 --> 03:18:05.664]  Which is a good point.
[03:18:05.704 --> 03:18:07.584]  He's talking about progress and great ideas.
[03:18:08.204 --> 03:18:10.525]  He's, notice, we're two hours in.
[03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:11.945]  No attacks on the enemy.
[03:18:12.545 --> 03:18:12.725]  Right.
[03:18:13.225 --> 03:18:13.785]  Almost none.
[03:18:14.285 --> 03:18:16.526]  And that, it's, people think he's this big mean guy.
[03:18:16.546 --> 03:18:17.366]  It's the opposite.
[03:18:18.066 --> 03:18:18.666]  He should be meaner.
[03:18:19.887 --> 03:18:20.407]  Exactly.
[03:18:21.807 --> 03:18:22.507]  Go back to Trump.
[03:18:22.667 --> 03:18:23.787]  American dream back.
[03:18:23.947 --> 03:18:25.248]  More important than anything else.
[03:18:25.448 --> 03:18:26.728]  It's, it's like,
[03:18:27.421 --> 03:18:30.522]  You don't have that today because the people, they've been just sucked.
[03:18:30.602 --> 03:18:35.943]  They see incompetent people running our, you know, the Biden thing is very interesting.
[03:18:36.003 --> 03:18:37.943]  People just found him to be incompetent.
[03:18:38.503 --> 03:18:42.524]  And when I debated him, I was like, is this for real?
[03:18:42.984 --> 03:18:43.264]  It was.
[03:18:43.544 --> 03:18:45.565]  Yeah, it was just absurd.
[03:18:46.405 --> 03:18:51.686]  But, you know, I think there are like, you know, some, some, you know, grand projects that we could do.
[03:18:51.746 --> 03:18:52.206]  I mean, I think,
[03:18:53.071 --> 03:18:54.092]  Yeah, grand projects.
[03:18:54.292 --> 03:18:57.653]  We could build a base on the moon, we could send... We need new pyramids.
[03:18:57.973 --> 03:19:00.014]  Big grand projects.
[03:19:00.034 --> 03:19:00.975]  That was one time.
[03:19:01.035 --> 03:19:02.295]  That's nice to hear, man.
[03:19:02.395 --> 03:19:03.536]  Gotta have it.
[03:19:03.576 --> 03:19:05.657]  You're like, oh, space costs money.
[03:19:05.677 --> 03:19:06.697]  What are you talking about?
[03:19:06.757 --> 03:19:07.657]  It's unlimited money.
[03:19:07.697 --> 03:19:09.318]  It's what we want to do.
[03:19:09.378 --> 03:19:10.499]  It creates jobs.
[03:19:10.639 --> 03:19:11.939]  Like, oh, let's kill old people.
[03:19:12.239 --> 03:19:13.180]  No, you take care of them.
[03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:14.160]  It creates jobs.
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:15.641]  It doesn't cost you.
[03:19:15.661 --> 03:19:16.721]  The pie is unlimited.
[03:19:16.761 --> 03:19:18.842]  It's a non-zero-sum game.
[03:19:20.743 --> 03:19:22.104]  Jesus Christ, it's so easy to understand this.
[03:19:22.124 --> 03:19:22.944]  I'm really getting pissed.
[03:19:22.964 --> 03:19:24.685]  Listen, we've got to all go to the next SpaceX launch.
[03:19:24.705 --> 03:19:26.206]  Take Canaveral or Texas, we've got to go.
[03:19:38.161 --> 03:19:54.430]  I think we could do some things, like China's got incredible high-speed rail between its cities, but I think it's actually possible with tunnels, if it was deregulation with an ability to actually
[03:19:55.330 --> 03:20:06.074]  Where it's, like, legal to actually do the tunnels, then you could have high-speed tunnels that are actually better than anything else in the world for high-speed transport between cities.
[03:20:06.634 --> 03:20:13.256]  And that would be something that, you know, Americans could say, wow, okay, we've got something that's cooler than anyone else in the world.
[03:20:13.276 --> 03:20:13.857]  Yeah, gosh, please.
[03:20:14.097 --> 03:20:15.697]  That's the kind of thing that makes you proud to be an American.
[03:20:15.737 --> 03:20:18.998]  And much safer than surface- But he answered, a whole new economy?
[03:20:19.018 --> 03:20:20.759]  Well, there's a danger there, you know, with people
[03:20:21.414 --> 03:20:27.699]  If we decided to, like, stack peanuts on top of each other and we made a job that creates money, we have to have emissions, is what I'm saying.
[03:20:28.039 --> 03:20:29.600]  What Elon Musk is talking about— Are you against the tunnels?
[03:20:29.980 --> 03:20:30.180]  No, no, no.
[03:20:30.220 --> 03:20:30.841]  No, no, no.
[03:20:31.001 --> 03:20:32.482]  I'm, like, this is, like, my dream.
[03:20:32.662 --> 03:20:35.464]  Like, finally innovating personal travel.
[03:20:35.924 --> 03:20:37.526]  Finally innovating commute.
[03:20:38.026 --> 03:20:42.249]  We're building this double-decker highway right now in Austin.
[03:20:42.329 --> 03:20:43.890]  It'll take 10, 20 years, probably.
[03:20:44.010 --> 03:20:44.811]  I mean, it'll be insane.
[03:20:44.971 --> 03:20:46.012]  It's starting to be flying cars.
[03:20:46.412 --> 03:20:49.134]  The self-driving needs to be in the flying ships.
[03:20:50.523 --> 03:20:52.044]  That's where you need it.
[03:20:52.444 --> 03:20:54.746]  By the way, if you find a helicopter now, it's all remote control.
[03:20:54.766 --> 03:20:56.727]  You just go bloop bloop, it takes off.
[03:20:57.768 --> 03:20:59.929]  I'm loving Elon Musk talking about this.
[03:21:00.069 --> 03:21:15.399]  And maybe tunnels are the next level, but I'm saying we could have, and Texas would be the perfect place to do this, to experiment with maglev technology on trains, and we could have a base in Austin, and it goes to Houston, it goes to Dallas, it goes to San Antonio.
[03:21:15.459 --> 03:21:16.900]  Maglev train technology.
[03:21:17.881 --> 03:21:18.601]  Tesla train.
[03:21:18.801 --> 03:21:19.302]  It'd be amazing.
[03:21:20.728 --> 03:21:24.693]  And we're talking 15 minutes to Houston, Dallas, San Antonio.
[03:21:24.913 --> 03:21:25.434]  Just like that.
[03:21:25.454 --> 03:21:30.460]  Instead of sitting in your car in hours-long drives and traffic and commutes on busted-ass roads.
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:30.901]  20 minutes.
[03:21:31.422 --> 03:21:32.142]  Oh my gosh.
[03:21:32.203 --> 03:21:34.225]  No, that stuff's like, that's what I'm talking about.
[03:21:34.245 --> 03:21:34.866]  That's what I want.
[03:21:36.701 --> 03:21:37.141]  We can do it.
[03:21:37.321 --> 03:21:40.524]  I'm into that like Tim Walz is into, you know, horse stables.
[03:21:41.744 --> 03:21:43.345]  He's not actually into horse stables when he was a kid.
[03:21:43.365 --> 03:21:47.288]  I mean, the idea is people, you know, conservatism or whatever, people think you want to look back.
[03:21:47.348 --> 03:21:48.629]  No, I don't want to go back to the 50s.
[03:21:48.789 --> 03:21:52.091]  I want to create a future that people in the 50s thought we were going to have.
[03:21:52.111 --> 03:21:54.153]  Conservatism is conserving the Renaissance.
[03:21:54.173 --> 03:21:55.854]  It was the explosion of human potential.
[03:21:55.954 --> 03:21:56.194]  Sure.
[03:21:56.214 --> 03:21:56.354]  Yeah.
[03:21:56.374 --> 03:22:00.037]  We're trying to conserve the victory and it's progressive.
[03:22:00.377 --> 03:22:02.098]  They call it progressive like they're cancer.
[03:22:02.418 --> 03:22:03.159]  Let's go back to Trump.
[03:22:03.759 --> 03:22:04.700]  I got it down to four.
[03:22:05.851 --> 03:22:11.208]  And I got some things done very quickly, but it's really something that...
[03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:13.911]  It's gonna have to be worked on because it takes too long.
[03:22:14.351 --> 03:22:15.171]  Just takes too long.
[03:22:15.431 --> 03:22:17.312]  Is InfoWars up at the top right now?
[03:22:17.452 --> 03:22:17.872]  I love that.
[03:22:17.892 --> 03:22:18.172]  Who's that?
[03:22:18.212 --> 03:22:20.493]  InfoWars has been up there a lot today.
[03:22:20.733 --> 03:22:21.673]  Beautiful.
[03:22:21.733 --> 03:22:23.534]  Even on air, it's great to have us up there.
[03:22:39.759 --> 03:22:39.960]  We're good.
[03:22:50.137 --> 03:22:50.517]  Stagnation.
[03:22:50.537 --> 03:22:52.879]  That's a good idea, but that's why he went with mRNA.
[03:22:52.899 --> 03:22:54.280]  He disagrees to everything.
[03:22:54.320 --> 03:22:55.181]  No, a lot of it's bad.
[03:23:14.571 --> 03:23:21.436]  But people would go to other countries because you couldn't use this, the product, even if they thought it worked, because it's going through the FDA.
[03:23:21.876 --> 03:23:26.059]  I got it approved where you can, you basically, you look, nobody wanted it.
[03:23:26.079 --> 03:23:28.000]  The doctors didn't want it because of the liability.
[03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:30.702]  The country didn't want it, our country, because they didn't want to get sued.
[03:23:31.163 --> 03:23:32.404]  These are people terminally ill.
[03:23:32.724 --> 03:23:34.285]  The insurance companies didn't want it.
[03:23:34.445 --> 03:23:36.526]  And the pharmaceutical companies, nobody wanted it.
[03:23:37.007 --> 03:23:41.470]  I got everybody into a room and we came up with an agreement that you won't get sued.
[03:23:42.376 --> 03:23:44.357]  And also, they didn't want it on their record.
[03:23:44.397 --> 03:23:48.280]  If somebody's terminally ill and they die after taking a drug, they didn't want that on their record.
[03:23:48.320 --> 03:23:54.043]  So we set a separate list so it wouldn't count as a negative.
[03:23:54.403 --> 03:23:55.604]  And as you know, we got it done.
[03:23:56.044 --> 03:23:57.545]  We have saved right to try.
[03:23:57.565 --> 03:23:59.226]  This is all great.
[03:23:59.266 --> 03:24:00.447]  Trump's all about solutions.
[03:24:01.087 --> 03:24:05.313]  But he's not exposing the Democrats and how evil they are.
[03:24:05.453 --> 03:24:07.817]  The open borders, the human trafficking, any of that.
[03:24:08.478 --> 03:24:10.741]  And this is a big opportunity when he's on these shows.
[03:24:11.242 --> 03:24:11.963]  But maybe I'm wrong.
[03:24:11.983 --> 03:24:13.645]  Maybe it's good he's talking about the positive stuff.
[03:24:13.665 --> 03:24:14.046]  What do you think?
[03:24:15.046 --> 03:24:19.989]  Well, I don't know if he has a strategy to this, but he doesn't have to win over his base.
[03:24:20.029 --> 03:24:25.413]  He's got to win over the politically uninformed, the politically neutral, the fence-sitters.
[03:24:25.733 --> 03:24:26.874]  And they're listening to him.
[03:24:26.894 --> 03:24:27.975]  He's a nice guy.
[03:24:28.035 --> 03:24:29.416]  So maybe that's the strategy here.
[03:24:29.436 --> 03:24:37.421]  What I'd like to see, though, because he said he wanted to shut down the Department of Education on this livestream, and the Democrats are already attacking him on that.
[03:24:37.501 --> 03:24:40.664]  Oh my gosh, look, he wants to shut... Well, he needs to lean into that.
[03:24:40.684 --> 03:24:41.344]  Say, what do you mean?
[03:24:41.384 --> 03:24:42.345]  You want more government?
[03:24:42.825 --> 03:24:46.086]  No, we don't want a central government running education.
[03:24:46.166 --> 03:24:47.326]  What the hell are you talking about?
[03:24:47.366 --> 03:24:48.787]  Like, yeah, I want to shut down the government.
[03:24:48.827 --> 03:24:49.887]  Yeah, I want less government.
[03:24:50.007 --> 03:24:50.807]  Like, how is that?
[03:24:50.867 --> 03:24:51.868]  That's a winning message.
[03:24:52.048 --> 03:24:52.408]  I don't know.
[03:24:52.568 --> 03:24:52.828]  I don't know.
[03:24:52.848 --> 03:24:53.608]  Gotta lean into it.
[03:24:53.728 --> 03:24:54.529]  Yeah.
[03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:56.249]  No, I completely agree.
[03:24:56.769 --> 03:25:07.933]  I love the futuristic talk and especially because it's something I know I'm not alone when you see videos of China and their skyscrapers and their new airports and you think, we got nothing like that in America.
[03:25:07.953 --> 03:25:08.933]  No, because we give it all to Ukraine.
[03:25:09.133 --> 03:25:11.434]  Because we gave it all to China, right?
[03:25:11.474 --> 03:25:15.756]  I mean, this was a choice made by our elites to decommission us and to build up China.
[03:25:15.776 --> 03:25:16.676]  It's a choice they're making.
[03:25:16.716 --> 03:25:17.697]  It doesn't have to be that way.
[03:25:17.917 --> 03:25:20.278]  People have a fatalistic view of the West is going down.
[03:25:20.318 --> 03:25:21.198]  We're just riding it down.
[03:25:21.218 --> 03:25:23.059]  That's the CFR, the Chinese century.
[03:25:23.099 --> 03:25:23.419]  Exactly.
[03:25:23.439 --> 03:25:24.199]  But you can choose it.
[03:25:24.259 --> 03:25:28.801]  You can choose to actually build and actually be on the forefront and actually... And that's what Elon's doing.
[03:25:29.221 --> 03:25:30.442]  And so people that attack Elon...
[03:25:32.278 --> 03:25:34.039]  Jesus said, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:25:34.539 --> 03:25:36.700]  Elon's fruit the last three years is pure gold.
[03:25:37.840 --> 03:25:42.522]  In fact, I'm honored to promote Elon and honored to say he's doing a great job.
[03:25:42.982 --> 03:25:43.882]  I don't know his motives.
[03:25:44.022 --> 03:25:44.803]  I don't know his heart.
[03:25:45.003 --> 03:25:45.703]  Only God does.
[03:25:46.043 --> 03:25:50.905]  But I'm not going to sit here in the way of this when he's doing a great job because I'm not this holier-than-thou person.
[03:25:51.488 --> 03:25:51.668]  Yeah.
[03:25:51.948 --> 03:25:57.092]  No, the drive for perfectionism or the purity spiraling is killing us over on the right.
[03:25:57.152 --> 03:26:00.655]  If you're not exactly, you know, everything they want... Well, it's like Joe Rogan.
[03:26:00.755 --> 03:26:00.895]  Yeah.
[03:26:00.975 --> 03:26:02.956]  I mean, he's like, well, I like RFK Jr.
[03:26:03.096 --> 03:26:04.557]  Well, he's better than Trump on vaccines.
[03:26:04.577 --> 03:26:05.678]  He didn't even say vote for him.
[03:26:05.698 --> 03:26:06.399]  He said I like him.
[03:26:06.719 --> 03:26:06.879]  Yeah.
[03:26:07.079 --> 03:26:09.781]  Joe is totally defeating the globalists right now.
[03:26:09.841 --> 03:26:10.822]  He's dominating the new old order.
[03:26:11.182 --> 03:26:12.003]  Why are we mad?
[03:26:12.083 --> 03:26:15.505]  Why does he have to... We're not the left where you've got to follow our orthodoxy.
[03:26:15.525 --> 03:26:15.505]  100%.
[03:26:17.887 --> 03:26:18.567]  I'd like to see...
[03:26:19.810 --> 03:26:24.693]  Before the October surprise, RFK Jr.
[03:26:24.733 --> 03:26:28.675]  dropped out and endorsed Trump, and Trump promised RFK Jr.
[03:26:29.095 --> 03:26:34.638]  a role in his administration, whether that's on environment or vaccine safety.
[03:26:34.818 --> 03:26:35.878]  It's a perfect trade-off.
[03:26:36.239 --> 03:26:37.059]  RFK Jr.
[03:26:37.159 --> 03:26:40.101]  gets to have some say in the next presidency.
[03:26:41.101 --> 03:26:44.786]  Donald Trump gets to gain some of that RFK momentum.
[03:26:45.266 --> 03:26:46.628]  Because look, you got to be a realist.
[03:26:46.708 --> 03:26:47.148]  RFK Jr.
[03:26:47.168 --> 03:26:48.530]  is not going to carry a single state.
[03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:50.412]  He's not going to get in a single electoral vote.
[03:26:50.432 --> 03:26:51.594]  He's a great guy.
[03:26:51.654 --> 03:26:52.435]  But he is a great guy.
[03:26:52.455 --> 03:26:53.136]  He's a great American.
[03:26:53.156 --> 03:26:53.897]  He's his own man.
[03:26:54.537 --> 03:26:57.701]  And I would like to see some of his policies
[03:26:58.602 --> 03:27:00.103]  Absorbed into the Trump administration.
[03:27:00.163 --> 03:27:01.183]  And he knows what he's talking about.
[03:27:01.203 --> 03:27:03.384]  I mean, if you read the real Anthony Fauci, the book that he wrote.
[03:27:03.464 --> 03:27:04.104]  It's well written.
[03:27:04.144 --> 03:27:05.925]  He has studied this stuff for decades.
[03:27:05.965 --> 03:27:08.446]  So it's not, he's not just, you know, Trump's appointing his friend.
[03:27:08.486 --> 03:27:10.006]  It's like, no, this guy is an expert in this.
[03:27:10.026 --> 03:27:11.967]  Plus, the deep states killed two of his family members.
[03:27:12.147 --> 03:27:12.327]  Right.
[03:27:12.968 --> 03:27:13.568]  That'll wake you up.
[03:27:13.588 --> 03:27:15.569]  All right, let's go back to Trump.
[03:27:16.569 --> 03:27:18.190]  What happened to the people that sold them?
[03:27:18.270 --> 03:27:18.690]  Oh, nothing.
[03:27:19.330 --> 03:27:19.890]  They got away.
[03:27:20.410 --> 03:27:23.131]  They always get away.
[03:27:24.372 --> 03:27:26.873]  And they don't even bother reporting it because
[03:27:27.574 --> 03:27:31.799]  There's no, they know that there's not, they're not going to, you know, people are not going to get prosecuted.
[03:27:31.819 --> 03:27:36.104]  They just, they just let, you know, violent criminals out in New York.
[03:27:36.485 --> 03:27:39.068]  The only one that gets prosecuted is Donald Trump.
[03:27:39.128 --> 03:27:41.190]  They don't get, they prosecute Trump.
[03:27:41.210 --> 03:27:41.450]  Yeah.
[03:27:41.531 --> 03:27:47.738]  I mean, it's, it's just obviously messed up if violent criminals are being, are being getting off scot-free.
[03:27:48.328 --> 03:27:50.711]  Yeah, let's talk about the prosecution of Trump.
[03:28:05.086 --> 03:28:07.568]  By the way, screw everybody that's been attacking Elon, man.
[03:28:07.588 --> 03:28:09.569]  I mean, he is like, literally, a whole new order's hatched around him.
[03:28:09.609 --> 03:28:10.249]  It's meant for everybody.
[03:28:10.289 --> 03:28:13.391]  You know, I feel like with Elon Musk, it's like, for anybody that's seen The Patriot,
[03:28:30.262 --> 03:28:33.784]  He doesn't want to get involved, he doesn't want to get involved, he doesn't want to get involved and then they kill his son.
[03:28:33.804 --> 03:28:37.367]  Alright, make that point in a minute, but Trump's making a key point, I want to get through him to get to us.
[03:28:37.427 --> 03:28:39.768]  Nice when I say that, in many cases crooked as hell.
[03:28:39.928 --> 03:28:40.408]  Come on, you're ready.
[03:28:40.448 --> 03:28:53.497]  But you get a judge and you go into an area where a Republican gets three or four percent of the vote and you know you'll have a jury pool with people that hate Republicans or hate, it could also be the other way though.
[03:28:53.517 --> 03:28:53.737]  Of course.
[03:28:53.757 --> 03:28:56.619]  Because it could start the other way in areas where they hate Democrats.
[03:28:56.639 --> 03:28:56.819]  Exactly.
[03:28:57.546 --> 03:29:04.110]  You get into a Pandora's box, it's a very dangerous thing for this country and a very dangerous thing even for the state.
[03:29:04.511 --> 03:29:12.836]  New York City and state lose a lot of business over what they did to me because these people say we don't want that to happen to us.
[03:29:12.936 --> 03:29:14.077]  It's no justice system.
[03:29:14.397 --> 03:29:20.661]  You have an unfair system of justice and it's costing New York State a tremendous amount of money.
[03:29:20.721 --> 03:29:23.463]  People are leaving and companies are leaving and they won't come back.
[03:29:24.102 --> 03:29:32.508]  So, you know, all of that stuff is important, but the economy now is the big thing, and we can turn that economy up so fast, and people are going to be back again.
[03:29:32.528 --> 03:29:33.908]  We're going to get rid of inflation.
[03:29:33.969 --> 03:29:35.429]  I think there's a lot of opportunity.
[03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:36.510]  Absolutely.
[03:29:37.351 --> 03:29:39.332]  And I just want to congratulate you.
[03:29:39.352 --> 03:29:40.693]  You've done an amazing job.
[03:29:40.733 --> 03:29:43.495]  You have definitely got a fertile mind.
[03:29:43.995 --> 03:29:47.638]  You know, we can talk, you and I can talk about rockets.
[03:29:47.858 --> 03:29:48.218]  Tunnels.
[03:29:48.278 --> 03:29:50.059]  We can talk about tunnels and rockets.
[03:29:50.419 --> 03:29:51.480]  They're wrapping up now.
[03:29:51.660 --> 03:29:52.401]  Electric cars.
[03:29:53.646 --> 03:29:55.046]  Trump just went on at, what, 745?
[03:29:55.106 --> 03:29:58.567]  So he's done an hour and a half?
[03:30:00.108 --> 03:30:00.768]  How long has he done?
[03:30:01.828 --> 03:30:02.908]  Yeah, almost two hours.
[03:30:02.928 --> 03:30:03.988]  Yeah, probably close to two hours.
[03:30:04.689 --> 03:30:05.329]  All right, back to them.
[03:30:06.149 --> 03:30:06.489]  Thank you.
[03:30:06.529 --> 03:30:14.431]  And well, I mean, I just say, you know, here's to an exciting, inspiring future that people can look forward to and be optimistic and excited about what happens next.
[03:30:15.037 --> 03:30:19.299]  And that's the kind of future that I think you will bring as president, and that's why I endorse you.
[03:30:19.439 --> 03:30:20.580]  Well, I appreciate that.
[03:30:20.640 --> 03:30:22.661]  That endorsement meant a lot to me.
[03:30:22.821 --> 03:30:25.102]  Not all endorsements mean that much, to be honest.
[03:30:25.182 --> 03:30:26.383]  Your endorsement meant a lot.
[03:30:27.223 --> 03:30:29.604]  And, you know, we have a phrase, Make America Great Again.
[03:30:29.624 --> 03:30:32.466]  It's pretty simple, but it really says that we want to make America great again.
[03:30:32.546 --> 03:30:33.146]  And we can do it.
[03:30:33.987 --> 03:30:34.847]  We can do it now.
[03:30:35.547 --> 03:30:42.571]  But if we were going to suffer another four years like we've suffered for the last four years, I'm not sure the country can ever come back.
[03:30:42.981 --> 03:30:43.821]  That's how bad it is.
[03:30:43.921 --> 03:30:44.582]  It's so bad.
[03:30:44.662 --> 03:30:46.482]  We have to do a lot of things.
[03:30:46.502 --> 03:30:47.563]  I think that's a very real risk.
[03:30:47.603 --> 03:30:48.223]  Yeah, it's a big risk.
[03:30:48.243 --> 03:30:49.143]  It's a very real risk.
[03:30:49.703 --> 03:30:58.226]  And I'd just like to note to the people listening, I've not been very political before, and if you look at my records... Yeah, now's the time.
[03:30:58.286 --> 03:30:59.327]  You gotta do it now.
[03:30:59.347 --> 03:31:01.267]  We're in too much danger.
[03:31:01.307 --> 03:31:03.028]  He's about to say that.
[03:31:03.108 --> 03:31:09.610]  ...because I'm making electric vehicles and solar and batteries, helping with the environment, and I actually...
[03:31:13.129 --> 03:31:13.950]  Supported Obama.
[03:31:13.970 --> 03:31:17.832]  I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama's hand when when he was running for president.
[03:31:18.013 --> 03:31:22.696]  And, you know, so it's not like I'm like some sort of dyed-in-the-wool, long-term Republican.
[03:31:22.756 --> 03:31:27.740]  Actually, I call myself, you know, historically a moderate Democrat.
[03:31:28.060 --> 03:31:32.883]  But now I feel like we're really at a critical juncture for the country.
[03:31:34.004 --> 03:31:41.169]  And, you know, I think a lot of people thought, you know, the Biden administration would be a moderate administration, but it's not.
[03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:42.030]  And obviously,
[03:31:43.290 --> 03:31:51.217]  We're just going to see an even further left administration with Kamala.
[03:31:51.237 --> 03:31:52.518]  That's my honest opinion.
[03:31:52.998 --> 03:31:59.864]  I mean, her dad is literally... I mean, she was brought up as an actual... Her dad is a Marxist economist.
[03:32:00.144 --> 03:32:00.785]  You can Google it.
[03:32:00.865 --> 03:32:03.147]  I mean, it's not a... We're not making this up, you know?
[03:32:04.408 --> 03:32:05.788]  That's how she was brought up.
[03:32:06.969 --> 03:32:22.718]  And we want to have a future that is prosperous, and I think we're just at this critical juncture, and I think this is a case of America is at a fork in the road.
[03:32:22.738 --> 03:32:23.699]  It's true.
[03:32:24.159 --> 03:32:31.183]  And I think it will take the path, like you are the path to prosperity, and I think Kamala is the opposite.
[03:32:31.636 --> 03:32:33.357]  That's my honest opinion.
[03:32:33.417 --> 03:32:35.037]  I'm going to get attacked like crazy.
[03:32:35.617 --> 03:32:37.718]  I've also experienced quite a bit of lawfare myself.
[03:32:40.139 --> 03:32:42.459]  I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion.
[03:32:42.479 --> 03:32:45.960]  I haven't been really active in politics before.
[03:32:46.721 --> 03:32:51.902]  I'm just trying to point out that my track record historically has been moderate, if not moderate, slightly left.
[03:32:53.923 --> 03:33:00.025]  This is to people out there who are in the moderate camp to say, I think you should support Donald Trump for president.
[03:33:01.424 --> 03:33:03.887]  And I think it's actually a very important junction in the road.
[03:33:04.127 --> 03:33:07.270]  And we're in deep trouble if it goes the other way.
[03:33:07.710 --> 03:33:08.711]  Well, I want to thank you.
[03:33:08.751 --> 03:33:11.914]  And, you know, I actually always did think of you as somewhat left.
[03:33:12.014 --> 03:33:12.774]  I must say that.
[03:33:12.835 --> 03:33:16.798]  So it's even more of an honor.
[03:33:16.818 --> 03:33:18.139]  I know how strong you feel about it.
[03:33:18.800 --> 03:33:23.724]  But, you know, when you think of her, San Francisco, 15 years ago, I had a great friend, Bob Tisch.
[03:33:23.764 --> 03:33:25.506]  He said it's the greatest city in America.
[03:33:26.363 --> 03:33:29.885]  And now it's, it's not, it's almost not livable.
[03:33:30.286 --> 03:33:36.309]  And California, likewise, he was involved in the destruction of San Francisco and the destruction of California.
[03:33:36.770 --> 03:33:44.335]  And he will be involved in the destruction of our country if people are so unwise as to elect her.
[03:33:44.375 --> 03:33:46.296]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[03:33:46.376 --> 03:33:48.637]  And I hope the elections are going to be run honestly.
[03:33:50.267 --> 03:33:51.688]  We're going to turn this country around.
[03:33:51.728 --> 03:33:54.889]  We're going to we're going to do things that and we can do it fairly quickly.
[03:33:55.429 --> 03:34:00.351]  And we have to get rid of the criminals that have been, you know, given to us by other countries as they laugh.
[03:34:00.691 --> 03:34:01.412]  They laugh at us.
[03:34:01.472 --> 03:34:02.432]  They think we're stupid.
[03:34:02.572 --> 03:34:05.554]  But more importantly, the illegals is the deep state that did it.
[03:34:05.574 --> 03:34:08.715]  Stone cold killers, in many cases, cases and terrorists.
[03:34:09.415 --> 03:34:12.556]  And they're in our country by the hundreds of thousands.
[03:34:12.617 --> 03:34:12.857]  Yeah.
[03:34:13.277 --> 03:34:14.497]  And we have to take them out.
[03:34:15.858 --> 03:34:18.259]  Yeah, I mean, if I could summarize it, perhaps, you know, I think
[03:34:19.661 --> 03:34:42.152]  These are issues that I think most people would agree with, which is that we want safe and clean cities, we want secure borders, we want sensible government spending, we want to restore both the perception and the reality of respect in the judicial system, stop the lawfare, and I think
[03:34:42.879 --> 03:34:43.861]  Yeah, stop the trial lawyers.
[03:34:43.981 --> 03:34:45.383]  Trial lawyers, Jesus Christ.
[03:34:57.733 --> 03:35:02.294]  Everybody go to Real Alex Jones and retweet it.
[03:35:02.334 --> 03:35:03.394]  Repost it.
[03:35:03.674 --> 03:35:04.294]  Live feed.
[03:35:04.334 --> 03:35:09.435]  We're about to merge with Nick Sordor and take your comments.
[03:35:09.895 --> 03:35:11.156]  But you are the power.
[03:35:11.316 --> 03:35:12.236]  You're the Paul Revere.
[03:35:12.316 --> 03:35:13.276]  Take the feed now.
[03:35:13.976 --> 03:35:15.237]  Retweet it right now.
[03:35:15.257 --> 03:35:16.597]  Real Alex Jones.
[03:35:16.637 --> 03:35:18.277]  Take the live show feed right now.
[03:35:19.037 --> 03:35:19.397]  Go there.
[03:35:19.417 --> 03:35:21.738]  You'll see at the top and repost it right now.
[03:35:21.758 --> 03:35:22.738]  You've got all the power.
[03:35:23.885 --> 03:35:27.748]  We'll go and we'll have a meeting and dinner in Venezuela because that's what's happening.
[03:35:28.088 --> 03:35:31.371]  Their crime rates coming down and our crime rates going through the roof.
[03:35:31.771 --> 03:35:32.692]  And it's so simple.
[03:35:32.812 --> 03:35:44.620]  And if you haven't seen anything yet, because these people have come into our country and they're just getting acclimated and they don't know about being politically correct law enforcement or lack of law enforcement.
[03:35:45.101 --> 03:35:47.302]  And our police, I have to just end with this.
[03:35:48.720 --> 03:35:52.985]  Absolutely, and it's obviously demoralizing if you're a police officer risking your life.
[03:36:07.918 --> 03:36:14.100]  Well, again, I think this interview is more towards fence-sitters, undecided voters, moderates.
[03:36:14.660 --> 03:36:15.781]  That's where this interview is.
[03:36:15.801 --> 03:36:16.541]  And it scared the left.
[03:36:16.561 --> 03:36:17.361]  They tried to stop it.
[03:36:18.102 --> 03:36:22.443]  The Harris campaign is already in panic mode, demanding people donate to her.
[03:36:22.723 --> 03:36:23.304]  So, yes.
[03:36:24.024 --> 03:36:24.484]  Absolutely.
[03:36:24.664 --> 03:36:26.805]  Which is why are they so scared, Harrison?
[03:36:27.879 --> 03:36:33.421]  Well, you know, the way they're framing it is Elon, the richest man in the world, is doing what he can to control America.
[03:36:33.441 --> 03:36:43.766]  I mean, it's all absurd ridiculousness, but, you know, even just going back to the conversation about Elon Musk and people sort of in gratitude for what he's done, I just know, like, the crap we go through here...
[03:36:44.406 --> 03:36:45.747]  And then, you know, we're fine with it.
[03:36:45.767 --> 03:36:46.087]  It's fine.
[03:36:46.167 --> 03:36:47.288]  We'll go through it.
[03:36:47.328 --> 03:36:52.793]  We'll deal with all the crap that we're given that we don't even talk about on air, but the stuff that you know about is bad enough already.
[03:36:53.213 --> 03:37:00.619]  And then you go on Twitter and people are calling you a shill and saying, and you sit there and go, why am I going through all this for these, you know, for people that don't even appreciate it?
[03:37:00.759 --> 03:37:02.120]  But if you give up, we lose it all.
[03:37:02.140 --> 03:37:03.561]  Let me see your glasses real quick.
[03:37:03.601 --> 03:37:03.921]  Yeah.
[03:37:04.502 --> 03:37:08.085]  These are the famous American psycho glasses.
[03:37:08.625 --> 03:37:08.985]  That's right.
[03:37:09.005 --> 03:37:09.886]  David Koresh Jr.
[03:37:09.906 --> 03:37:10.427]  Look at this.
[03:37:11.527 --> 03:37:12.088]  I like these.
[03:37:12.308 --> 03:37:13.309]  I got pretty bad eyesight, don't I?
[03:37:14.099 --> 03:37:15.039]  They're the real deal.
[03:37:15.279 --> 03:37:16.159]  I'm gonna get a fishbowl.
[03:37:16.179 --> 03:37:16.560]  I like this.
[03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:19.180]  Let's go back to Trump real quick.
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:20.000]  What can I say?
[03:37:20.020 --> 03:37:22.681]  They want to be able to do their job, but I've seen them get shot.
[03:37:22.781 --> 03:37:23.961]  They put some lotion on his skin.
[03:37:23.981 --> 03:37:33.363]  I've never seen where these guys are standing in the middle of a big street, everybody watching them, and they're literally boxing, like punching, stand-up fighting.
[03:37:34.323 --> 03:37:39.044]  A police officer, there were two of them, and you had about six of these guys, and they're punching the hell out of them.
[03:37:39.716 --> 03:37:43.419]  And in their own country, they would be dead if they did that.
[03:37:43.479 --> 03:37:44.259]  They'd be shot.
[03:37:44.840 --> 03:37:46.241]  They would be shot instantly.
[03:37:46.962 --> 03:37:51.965]  And you know, they come from these countries and it's taken them a while to realize that we don't do that in this country.
[03:37:52.286 --> 03:37:57.950]  But in their own country, if they stood on a street and had a fight with a police officer, they would be shot.
[03:37:58.310 --> 03:37:59.931]  There's no political correctness.
[03:38:00.712 --> 03:38:03.694]  And it's such a sad, it's such a sad thing to see.
[03:38:04.054 --> 03:38:07.337]  And that's the reason you have crime, by the way, because we don't do anything about it.
[03:38:08.649 --> 03:38:21.698]  Yeah, we just cannot have a situation where our police officers will be beaten up on camera by, you know, a gang of illegal immigrants, and then nothing happens to... Well Soros does that on purpose, to create the lawlessness, because they're going to bail them all out.
[03:38:22.118 --> 03:38:24.400]  When Trump wins, they've said they're going to burn the country down.
[03:38:24.740 --> 03:38:28.682]  They're getting ready, and I wish they'd got to this, but Trump's almost there.
[03:38:28.722 --> 03:38:30.484]  But yeah, now they're starting to get there.
[03:38:31.647 --> 03:38:35.450]  Soros isn't doing this for fun just because, oh, we want to get cops killed.
[03:38:35.470 --> 03:38:40.293]  They're doing it because they're getting ready to bring in total disorder and then martial law is the answer.
[03:38:47.808 --> 03:38:51.069]  And the general told me, the generals told me, sir, we can't bring them back.
[03:38:51.109 --> 03:38:53.950]  The countries won't accept MS-13 gang members.
[03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.791]  They won't accept them.
[03:38:55.171 --> 03:39:02.013]  And I said, really, how much do we pay these various countries in terms of economic aid, which is also somewhat ridiculous.
[03:39:02.033 --> 03:39:03.434]  That's how you made them take them back.
[03:39:03.494 --> 03:39:04.974]  And the answer is $750 million.
[03:39:05.034 --> 03:39:05.435]  Go look.
[03:39:05.455 --> 03:39:06.275]  The numbers are public.
[03:39:06.435 --> 03:39:08.556]  USAID.com.
[03:39:08.596 --> 03:39:11.917]  We're not paying them anymore because they won't accept them.
[03:39:12.077 --> 03:39:12.817]  And you know what happened?
[03:39:12.837 --> 03:39:14.338]  They all called me, every one of them.
[03:39:14.378 --> 03:39:14.678]  They said,
[03:39:15.242 --> 03:39:17.223]  We would be honored to take them back, sir.
[03:39:17.263 --> 03:39:18.163]  We would be honored.
[03:39:18.544 --> 03:39:19.224]  It was so easy.
[03:39:19.524 --> 03:39:20.765]  But it's one of those things.
[03:39:20.825 --> 03:39:21.445]  And we got them back.
[03:39:21.465 --> 03:39:22.446]  We took in so many.
[03:39:22.486 --> 03:39:26.027]  You know, MS-13 is probably the worst gangs in the world.
[03:39:26.067 --> 03:39:27.488]  They're the most vicious, violent.
[03:39:28.004 --> 03:39:33.047]  We took them out of here by the thousands and got them out of here and their countries took them back.
[03:39:33.147 --> 03:39:34.107]  So they're almost at two hours now.
[03:39:34.167 --> 03:39:37.589]  Because I said, you're not getting any more economic aid.
[03:39:37.629 --> 03:39:39.610]  How long is that?
[03:39:39.650 --> 03:39:41.231]  They wouldn't take them back for Obama.
[03:39:41.271 --> 03:39:43.152]  They wouldn't take them back for anybody.
[03:39:43.833 --> 03:39:50.316]  And now we have a problem because we have this guy and they, again, they don't take them back anymore with Biden because they don't respect him.
[03:39:52.518 --> 03:39:53.118]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:53.138 --> 03:39:55.319]  So it's just got to be done.
[03:39:55.339 --> 03:39:56.800]  We just can't have.
[03:39:57.444 --> 03:39:58.826]  We're good to go.
[03:40:14.546 --> 03:40:21.708]  Imagine the left, like, oh, Elon Musk is going to our private school, his firstborn son, let's cut his genitals off.
[03:40:22.148 --> 03:40:23.349]  That's a really good move.
[03:40:23.809 --> 03:40:26.430]  So, you know, if that doesn't piss you off, what doesn't?
[03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:28.910]  And don't make light of it, like, this is serious.
[03:40:29.251 --> 03:40:31.651]  I'm telling you, that was his patriot moment.
[03:40:32.812 --> 03:40:38.553]  That was Mel Gibson in the Patriot, didn't want to get involved, and they killed his kid, and next thing he did is he killed an entire British platoon.
[03:40:38.813 --> 03:40:40.574]  Guys, pull up the Patriot.
[03:40:41.914 --> 03:40:45.877]  Mel Gibson breaks or the Patriot kills British platoon.
[03:40:46.317 --> 03:40:50.380]  Pull up the scene where they shoot his son for no reason, which by the way is a true story.
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:53.583]  It's three stories combined, but that's his story.
[03:40:53.663 --> 03:40:55.104]  I read the book, it was a book written about it.
[03:40:55.244 --> 03:40:58.066]  I already read, I knew the book was accurate because I'd already read books on it.
[03:40:58.706 --> 03:41:01.088]  It was the Swamp Fox and two other people, but they combined it.
[03:41:01.348 --> 03:41:06.212]  And this one guy, it was a big British hero from the French Indian War.
[03:41:06.492 --> 03:41:10.135]  They killed his kid in front of him and he like literally killed hundreds of British soldiers after it.
[03:41:10.737 --> 03:41:13.398]  It's like, you're right, it's like that's the breaking point.
[03:41:13.918 --> 03:41:15.759]  So guys, pull up the Patriot, Mel Gibson.
[03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:17.420]  What would the scene be?
[03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:20.181]  The Patriot, Mel Gibson, kills British troops.
[03:41:20.961 --> 03:41:24.483]  Or saves his son, like kidnap the one son.
[03:41:24.503 --> 03:41:25.863]  No, no, no.
[03:41:25.984 --> 03:41:29.885]  It's... Mel Gibson's the Patriot's son killed.
[03:41:31.306 --> 03:41:32.866]  Or Mel Gibson forest scene.
[03:41:33.587 --> 03:41:34.187]  Something like that.
[03:41:34.227 --> 03:41:35.067]  We need to play that.
[03:41:35.087 --> 03:41:36.168]  Alright, back to Trump.
[03:41:37.216 --> 03:41:40.497]  You're allowed to do anything you want and nothing happens.
[03:41:40.617 --> 03:41:42.257]  And I'm talking about violent crime.
[03:41:42.758 --> 03:41:46.699]  And it's going to get more violent because these are really, really violent people.
[03:41:47.119 --> 03:41:48.979]  And we're going to get them out of our country.
[03:41:49.300 --> 03:41:55.081]  And we're going to get them back to where... Because they were sent here by the presidents and by the various people that run those countries.
[03:41:55.141 --> 03:41:56.502]  And I know every one of those guys.
[03:41:56.882 --> 03:41:57.882]  And they're smart people.
[03:41:58.342 --> 03:41:59.582]  And they're streetwise people.
[03:42:00.063 --> 03:42:01.123]  And they really think that
[03:42:01.977 --> 03:42:03.297]  The USA is stupid.
[03:42:03.397 --> 03:42:06.198]  They think we're run by stupid people, and they happen to be right.
[03:42:06.738 --> 03:42:08.939]  But when I was there, we had no problem.
[03:42:08.979 --> 03:42:09.479]  We got them out.
[03:42:09.499 --> 03:42:12.120]  We took out thousands of MS-13 gang members.
[03:42:12.160 --> 03:42:12.860]  We brought them back.
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:16.081]  And now, again, it's the same old story.
[03:42:16.121 --> 03:42:16.721]  We don't do it.
[03:42:17.121 --> 03:42:20.262]  And they actually gave them a big increase in aid.
[03:42:20.402 --> 03:42:24.523]  They raised it up to billions of dollars, and they get nothing for it.
[03:42:24.563 --> 03:42:29.885]  So, you know, I hope everybody's going to vote for Trump, and we're going to get this country
[03:42:30.892 --> 03:42:31.612]  And I didn't need this.
[03:42:31.652 --> 03:42:32.852]  I'm like, I didn't need this.
[03:42:33.192 --> 03:42:34.353]  I had a very nice life.
[03:42:34.453 --> 03:42:39.334]  I didn't need to go through court systems and go through all the other stuff and run at the same time.
[03:42:39.354 --> 03:42:39.974]  I have to run.
[03:42:39.994 --> 03:42:46.355]  I have to go through fake trials with, in some cases, corrupt judges, totally corrupt judges.
[03:42:46.895 --> 03:42:47.455]  I didn't need it.
[03:42:47.475 --> 03:42:48.435]  I had a nice life.
[03:42:48.935 --> 03:42:50.175]  I have great locations.
[03:42:50.195 --> 03:42:55.516]  I have beautiful oceans that I have places I, you know, I, this was, but I felt it was important.
[03:42:55.616 --> 03:42:58.477]  And if I had to, if I had to do it over again,
[03:42:59.309 --> 03:43:07.372]  You probably think I'm crazy for doing it, actually, but if I had to do it over again, I would have done it over again, because this is so much more important than me or my life.
[03:43:07.392 --> 03:43:08.713]  Yeah, I talked to the people that were there.
[03:43:08.733 --> 03:43:16.796]  Trump called all his family and crew in, and he said, in 2000, into 2015, he said, America's in too much trouble.
[03:43:16.877 --> 03:43:17.577]  I don't want to do this.
[03:43:17.657 --> 03:43:18.737]  I've talked about it for decades.
[03:43:18.817 --> 03:43:19.338]  I'm going to do it.
[03:43:19.858 --> 03:43:24.040]  He said, I want you all to vote, my family, and they unanimously voted for him to do it.
[03:43:26.140 --> 03:43:27.281]  That's, sorry, go back to Trump.
[03:43:28.909 --> 03:43:30.410]  The facts speak for themselves.
[03:43:30.450 --> 03:43:32.070]  It's so incredible.
[03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:37.852]  It's gotten to the point where people just don't even bother reporting crime in a lot of cities because they know nothing is going to happen.
[03:43:39.272 --> 03:43:41.653]  That's what I hear anecdotally from people all the time.
[03:43:42.293 --> 03:43:54.057]  My values, I'm just saying to the people out there, the things I think are important for the future is we've got to have safe cities, we've got to have secure borders, we've got to have sensible spending.
[03:43:54.077 --> 03:43:55.657]  Follow us at RealLogShows, folks.
[03:43:56.037 --> 03:43:57.658]  That's so important, RealLogShows.
[03:44:06.403 --> 03:44:10.265]  That's the future I'm looking for.
[03:44:10.705 --> 03:44:21.650]  I'm pro-environment, but I'm not against... I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry because they're keeping civilization going right now.
[03:44:22.891 --> 03:44:28.374]  But I do think we want to move at reasonable speed towards a sustainable energy economy.
[03:44:28.394 --> 03:44:29.254]  Those are my values.
[03:44:31.840 --> 03:44:40.864]  Yeah, give us the solar panel that we know you have, that you can put on top of your car and it runs for free.
[03:44:41.024 --> 03:44:41.465]  Give it to us.
[03:44:41.585 --> 03:44:42.745]  They don't want us to have that.
[03:44:47.176 --> 03:44:49.799]  We're going to be giving tremendous incentives.
[03:44:49.859 --> 03:44:53.503]  We want companies to build here, not to build in other locations.
[03:44:53.984 --> 03:44:55.245]  And we want to create jobs.
[03:44:55.686 --> 03:44:57.768]  And again, it's about the American dream.
[03:44:58.009 --> 03:45:00.471]  You don't hear about the American dream anymore, Elon.
[03:45:00.491 --> 03:45:00.952]  You don't hear.
[03:45:00.992 --> 03:45:02.914]  You're the American dream in the truest sense.
[03:45:03.255 --> 03:45:05.577]  But you don't hear about the American dream anymore.
[03:45:05.717 --> 03:45:06.679]  And you're going to hear about it.
[03:45:07.219 --> 03:45:10.802]  People, they need that incentive to go out and do it.
[03:45:11.122 --> 03:45:12.604]  And they're going to love their lives.
[03:45:12.784 --> 03:45:19.770]  I mean, they're going to love, they're going to look forward to getting up in the morning and going to, you know, going to a job that they love, not a job that they can't stand.
[03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:23.673]  So Trump just did two hours, I think in one minute.
[03:45:23.713 --> 03:45:24.754]  He's doing a great job.
[03:45:24.774 --> 03:45:26.556]  This is amazing.
[03:45:28.397 --> 03:45:30.639]  I challenge Kamala to come on with Elon and do this.
[03:45:31.039 --> 03:45:31.780]  She can't do it.
[03:45:31.820 --> 03:45:32.461]  She's retarded.
[03:45:35.296 --> 03:45:37.277]  She's a puppet.
[03:45:37.317 --> 03:45:38.457]  Imagine.
[03:45:38.577 --> 03:45:44.859]  Do you think Joe Biden or Hillary or any of them or Kamala could come on, Owen?
[03:45:45.579 --> 03:45:46.379]  Zero chance.
[03:45:46.839 --> 03:45:50.760]  Elon should extend the invitation to Kamala as a formality.
[03:45:51.080 --> 03:45:54.341]  She will obviously reject it, but he should extend that invitation.
[03:45:55.081 --> 03:45:56.241]  Because she didn't talk ten minutes.
[03:45:57.062 --> 03:46:01.503]  She's done five campaign events and she reads off a teleprompter for 20 minutes.
[03:46:02.123 --> 03:46:02.903]  That's what she does.
[03:46:04.798 --> 03:46:09.579]  Back to, haha, I can't even do her laugh, it's so evil, it's so disgusting.
[03:46:10.180 --> 03:46:18.882]  It's so fake, it's like, how could you come up with something, it's the nastiest thing you could come up with, but she's so disconnected from humanity, she thinks it's funny.
[03:46:19.362 --> 03:46:22.663]  Like, you know, I decided whether I would be a bitch or a whatever, what's her thing?
[03:46:23.663 --> 03:46:25.284]  Well, it's like her tell.
[03:46:25.905 --> 03:46:26.866]  You know, that's her tell.
[03:46:27.186 --> 03:46:33.311]  Whenever she doesn't even know what she's just said or doesn't know what she's going to say next, she just breaks out into the hyena castle.
[03:46:33.331 --> 03:46:35.232]  What's that clip from like 10 years ago that came out?
[03:46:35.272 --> 03:46:38.295]  She's like, you know, I don't want to be a nasty woman.
[03:46:38.315 --> 03:46:39.656]  I don't want to be a bitch.
[03:46:39.716 --> 03:46:44.300]  It's like, yeah, you got to find the fine line between being a strong woman or being a bitch.
[03:46:45.361 --> 03:46:47.442]  You seem to land on bitch.
[03:46:48.843 --> 03:46:49.364]  Back to Trump.
[03:46:49.384 --> 03:46:50.325]  He's about to disconnect.
[03:46:51.088 --> 03:46:53.830]  This is the end of my run.
[03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:56.972]  Trump's got, like, two steaks bubbling next to him with lobster tails.
[03:46:57.012 --> 03:46:57.532]  No, I'm serious.
[03:46:57.552 --> 03:46:58.053]  I know Trump.
[03:46:58.073 --> 03:47:00.074]  He waits until the end of the day.
[03:47:00.154 --> 03:47:01.015]  It's 11 o'clock where he's at.
[03:47:18.574 --> 03:47:21.936]  He's about to eat two lobsters and a steak.
[03:47:24.077 --> 03:47:24.698]  See you soon.
[03:47:24.718 --> 03:47:26.639]  71 million views on that space already.
[03:47:28.139 --> 03:47:29.320]  It'll have 400 million tomorrow.
[03:47:30.261 --> 03:47:30.561]  Watch.
[03:47:31.041 --> 03:47:32.222]  Yeah, Alex, I think you're right, though.
[03:47:32.242 --> 03:47:38.105]  I think Elon Musk wants a safe, prosperous country.
[03:47:38.185 --> 03:47:39.366]  Man, what kind of car is that?
[03:47:40.643 --> 03:47:41.403]  I have no idea.
[03:47:41.423 --> 03:47:42.004]  Is it in the room?
[03:47:42.024 --> 03:47:42.864]  What the hell was that?
[03:47:42.884 --> 03:47:43.925]  I don't know.
[03:47:44.145 --> 03:47:45.665]  That's even more badass than our cars.
[03:47:45.685 --> 03:47:46.386]  Yeah, what the hell?
[03:47:46.426 --> 03:47:47.326]  We both have Hellcats.
[03:47:47.346 --> 03:47:49.467]  That was like a combination factor or something.
[03:47:49.847 --> 03:47:51.548]  I had like eight Hellcats fire.
[03:47:51.588 --> 03:47:52.288]  That's what I want.
[03:47:52.388 --> 03:47:53.489]  I want a double Hellcat.
[03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:55.750]  I want the double Hellcat.
[03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:56.810]  You didn't copy me.
[03:47:56.830 --> 03:47:58.091]  I love it.
[03:47:58.191 --> 03:48:00.172]  How badass is your Hellcat?
[03:48:00.392 --> 03:48:03.113]  Look, me personally, I would never drive an electric vehicle.
[03:48:03.193 --> 03:48:03.794]  I don't like it.
[03:48:03.874 --> 03:48:04.394]  I like the classic.
[03:48:04.414 --> 03:48:05.494]  What is the power of the rumble?
[03:48:05.554 --> 03:48:06.295]  Isn't it relaxing?
[03:48:06.912 --> 03:48:08.015]  It's very therapeutic.
[03:48:08.376 --> 03:48:12.806]  It's just a very therapeutic thing when you deal in the trenches here every day to hop in that.
[03:48:12.946 --> 03:48:13.728]  Get in the Charger!
[03:48:14.169 --> 03:48:14.429]  And just...
[03:48:16.261 --> 03:48:16.541]  Yeah.
[03:48:16.981 --> 03:48:19.203]  So, getting back to what I was saying... No, I think you're right.
[03:48:19.243 --> 03:48:23.887]  I think Musk wants a safe, prosperous country to build his starbase at.
[03:48:24.808 --> 03:48:28.532]  He wants there to be smart people, capable people that he can hire.
[03:48:29.232 --> 03:48:33.116]  And he doesn't want it to be overrun by illegal criminals.
[03:48:33.696 --> 03:48:40.622]  And I also think, though, that his switch politically was when they transed his son, and that was... Well, he said that.
[03:48:42.184 --> 03:48:44.106]  He said, oh, my wife put him in elite school.
[03:48:44.867 --> 03:48:45.868]  Imagine them, though.
[03:48:46.048 --> 03:48:48.330]  Let's take Elon Musk's kid and cut his dick off.
[03:48:49.011 --> 03:48:49.992]  And then Elon stopped.
[03:48:50.012 --> 03:48:51.413]  They go, no, they took his kid away.
[03:48:51.433 --> 03:48:52.234]  It was game over.
[03:48:52.634 --> 03:48:53.695]  That's his Rubicon.
[03:48:54.196 --> 03:48:55.697]  I understand that.
[03:48:55.938 --> 03:49:00.642]  Well, and I don't know the name of the, I think it was the general, the British general
[03:49:01.263 --> 03:49:07.249]  Where he's the one going around killing all these people, and he comes back to Cornwallis, and Cornwallis is like, what the hell are you doing?
[03:49:07.770 --> 03:49:10.273]  Like, you're the one making these people pissed off!
[03:49:10.753 --> 03:49:13.176]  Like, you're the one ma- you made the Swamp Fox!
[03:49:13.616 --> 03:49:21.725]  Like, now I got these hundreds of South Carolinas- South Carolinians mowing down my units because you went out and killed their frickin' kids!
[03:49:22.421 --> 03:49:23.422]  It's a miscalculation.
[03:49:23.663 --> 03:49:26.185]  It's a true story.
[03:49:26.846 --> 03:49:28.167]  The Guardian defended the guy.
[03:49:28.247 --> 03:49:29.769]  His famous British officer did that.
[03:49:30.069 --> 03:49:31.271]  Yeah, well it's a miscalculation, right?
[03:49:31.291 --> 03:49:35.295]  He thinks we're going to intimidate these people and they're going to be cowed and instead he lights the fire.
[03:49:35.335 --> 03:49:38.298]  Yeah, like you kill our kids and you think we roll over?
[03:49:38.679 --> 03:49:39.620]  Now we're going to kill you!
[03:49:40.020 --> 03:49:40.220]  Yeah.
[03:49:40.681 --> 03:49:41.261]  That's insane.
[03:49:41.462 --> 03:49:42.703]  And thank God for Elon Musk.
[03:49:42.763 --> 03:49:43.223]  Absolutely.
[03:49:43.243 --> 03:49:44.485]  This was fantastic.
[03:49:44.505 --> 03:49:45.906]  But imagine the leftist brain.
[03:49:45.966 --> 03:49:48.529]  It's the same 250 years ago as it is now.
[03:49:49.089 --> 03:49:55.636]  They think because they mess with us and hurt us that we want to roll.
[03:49:56.817 --> 03:49:57.838]  Are you kidding me?
[03:49:58.868 --> 03:50:00.209]  I mean, it's completely opposite.
[03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:02.330]  Well, they don't have a survival instinct anymore.
[03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:03.771]  That's what they don't understand.
[03:50:03.851 --> 03:50:05.192]  We still have a survival instinct.
[03:50:05.332 --> 03:50:09.675]  They have completely, their survival instinct has been completely calcified.
[03:50:09.955 --> 03:50:10.775]  It's done.
[03:50:11.616 --> 03:50:13.757]  And so that's why they're into all the things they're into.
[03:50:14.217 --> 03:50:16.739]  And they think, we're just gonna roll over and die.
[03:50:17.799 --> 03:50:21.421]  Which, my message is this, we ain't rolling over and dying.
[03:50:21.781 --> 03:50:29.326]  So, I want to connect with Nick Sordor and all the great folks and take comments on X. The crew's been up here.
[03:50:30.706 --> 03:50:31.227]  We're doing it now.
[03:50:31.707 --> 03:50:38.391]  But I want to air the clip I mentioned from the Patriot of that scene where they kill his son, which is based on a true story, and he takes action.
[03:50:38.431 --> 03:50:38.691]  Here it is.
[03:51:03.978 --> 03:51:04.179]  Ah!
[03:51:49.819 --> 03:51:57.542]  Now this is a great clip and the crew's not bad, but I wanted the clip from when they shoot his kid five minutes before and then this happens.
[03:51:57.562 --> 03:52:02.724]  So maybe we'll add that in post or before the show ends, I will find the clip on my phone.
[03:52:03.044 --> 03:52:03.985]  We'll play the full clip.
[03:52:06.406 --> 03:52:07.206]  All right, go ahead.
[03:52:08.479 --> 03:52:16.586]  Because it's even worse because he actually just gave quarter to all the wounded British soldiers, and then the guy comes and kills his kid afterwards.
[03:52:16.606 --> 03:52:18.348]  So it's like, hey, I'm here in good faith.
[03:52:18.928 --> 03:52:23.752]  I just tended to your wounded, and you're still going to kill my kid right in front of me.
[03:52:23.772 --> 03:52:25.994]  And then he goes into the woods and he kills the entire battalion.
[03:52:26.034 --> 03:52:28.156]  So, I mean... Yeah, so we're going to find the full clip.
[03:52:28.216 --> 03:52:29.037]  That's like Musk.
[03:52:29.457 --> 03:52:30.799]  The full clip from the Patriot, yeah.
[03:52:31.139 --> 03:52:33.241]  Like, Musk was with them and they cut his kid's dick off.
[03:52:34.005 --> 03:52:35.686]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean, that's what happened.
[03:52:36.126 --> 03:52:39.287]  It's sad, and now it's even a completely turned-against-him situation.
[03:52:39.307 --> 03:52:42.269]  And that's when you know, like, wait, I'm a billionaire, but it doesn't matter.
[03:52:42.809 --> 03:52:43.889]  You want my kid's dick.
[03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:48.851]  It's a lesson that you can't stay out of this and you can't give in.
[03:52:48.911 --> 03:52:50.452]  It's like Goliad, right?
[03:52:50.752 --> 03:52:51.713]  Why'd the Alamo happen?
[03:52:52.893 --> 03:52:55.134]  You know, 100 plus people tried to surrender at Goliad.
[03:52:55.434 --> 03:52:57.894]  Santa Ana said, I'll give you all safe passage, and then he killed them all.
[03:52:57.994 --> 03:53:01.575]  So everybody at the Alamo went, there's no point in surrendering, because he's just going to kill us all.
[03:53:01.655 --> 03:53:03.396]  So there's no complying with these people.
[03:53:03.456 --> 03:53:05.596]  There's no accepting their offer of mercy.
[03:53:05.936 --> 03:53:06.537]  It's a lie.
[03:53:06.657 --> 03:53:07.437]  You know it's a lie.
[03:53:07.797 --> 03:53:09.998]  Take them on in victory or death.
[03:53:10.078 --> 03:53:11.458]  Like, that's where we're at right now.
[03:53:14.042 --> 03:53:14.943]  And that is where we are.
[03:53:15.123 --> 03:53:16.345]  God bless America.
[03:53:17.266 --> 03:53:18.287]  God, we're in big trouble.
[03:53:19.148 --> 03:53:20.429]  I cannot tell everybody right now.
[03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:22.852]  They shut down civilizations.
[03:53:24.514 --> 03:53:26.576]  The good news is they shut us down.
[03:53:27.858 --> 03:53:29.640]  Soros and all the rest of them are going to get it.
[03:53:30.781 --> 03:53:32.123]  So we got that.
[03:53:33.234 --> 03:53:37.337]  Well, you know, and the other thing, too, is we're not wishing death on anybody here.
[03:53:37.377 --> 03:53:39.319]  But, you know, Soros doesn't have much longer.
[03:53:39.379 --> 03:53:40.660]  Pelosi doesn't have much longer.
[03:53:41.381 --> 03:53:42.842]  Biden probably doesn't have much longer.
[03:53:43.602 --> 03:53:49.527]  Point being, the current corrupt political establishment is truly on its final breaths.
[03:53:49.747 --> 03:53:52.670]  And so the only thing they can hope to leave us with is total death and destruction.
[03:53:58.973 --> 03:53:59.313]  All right.
[03:53:59.514 --> 03:54:02.537]  Well, Harrison, you were up here at 6 a.m.
[03:54:02.577 --> 03:54:03.838]  this morning, so you get on out of here.
[03:54:03.858 --> 03:54:05.419]  You're going to be on at 8 a.m.
[03:54:05.439 --> 03:54:05.800]  tomorrow.
[03:54:05.840 --> 03:54:06.280]  We love you.
[03:54:07.361 --> 03:54:07.902]  I'll be back.
[03:54:08.022 --> 03:54:08.503]  Owen's with me.
[03:54:08.523 --> 03:54:09.544]  The crew's done a great job.
[03:54:10.785 --> 03:54:19.694]  Nick Sordor is simulcasting on Spaces, so let's go ahead and punch him up, see what he's hosting, let him take control now, and we'll
[03:54:22.643 --> 03:54:25.665]  Trump had more energy in that phone call than I probably have all day.
[03:54:25.685 --> 03:54:26.886]  It was incredible to see.
[03:54:26.966 --> 03:54:28.167]  I'm only 22, so good for him.
[03:54:51.676 --> 03:54:52.636]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:54:52.676 --> 03:54:59.059]  I think that this is, this is something that, you know, the left is trying to spin it as President Trump doesn't have the energy anymore.
[03:54:59.119 --> 03:55:04.381]  You know, he's, you know, they're trying to gaslight us into believing that Trump is actually Joe Biden.
[03:55:04.941 --> 03:55:13.264]  And, you know, with all the people that were there, video, even, you know, video recording Trump doing this, this entire space, you can tell he has the energy.
[03:55:13.364 --> 03:55:15.805]  I mean, the guy's mind never shut off.
[03:55:16.065 --> 03:55:17.745]  He just talked and talked and talked and talked.
[03:55:18.206 --> 03:55:19.146]  And, you know, it wasn't,
[03:55:19.706 --> 03:55:22.669]  Incoherent rambling like you get from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.
[03:55:22.689 --> 03:55:23.810]  He knows what he's talking about.
[03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:25.091]  He's educated on the issues.
[03:55:25.392 --> 03:55:27.073]  He's actually sharp as a tack.
[03:55:27.774 --> 03:55:30.156]  And, you know, that's my take on it.
[03:55:30.176 --> 03:55:33.699]  But I want to get Alex Jones's take on that, who is also up here on stage.
[03:55:34.060 --> 03:55:35.581]  Alex Jones, welcome to the space.
[03:55:35.861 --> 03:55:37.283]  Pleasure to have you co-hosting with me, sir.
[03:55:37.819 --> 03:55:39.180]  Well, Nick, great to be here with you.
[03:55:39.220 --> 03:55:46.464]  You know, my crew's been here since 6 a.m., and I've been here since 9 a.m., but it is a distinct pleasure to be here with you.
[03:55:46.944 --> 03:55:49.545]  Yeah, we just saw the true, authentic nature of Trump.
[03:55:50.086 --> 03:55:57.390]  Two hours, and he waited while there was 45 minutes of technical problems and attacks, and he just knocked it out of the park as usual.
[03:55:58.030 --> 03:56:02.792]  So, this is just a real guy that cares about America and wants to stop the Deep State.
[03:56:02.812 --> 03:56:03.673]  That's why they want to kill him.
[03:56:03.693 --> 03:56:05.374]  They already tried to kill him 30 days ago.
[03:56:05.934 --> 03:56:06.935]  We forget about that.
[03:56:07.515 --> 03:56:09.736]  And we're at such an epic moment in history.
[03:56:09.776 --> 03:56:17.759]  We just had NATO is openly running attacks into Russia, 100 miles into Russia, trying to get Russia to over-respond.
[03:56:18.099 --> 03:56:19.360]  We're on the edge of World War III.
[03:56:19.380 --> 03:56:20.781]  They're trying to stir up Iran.
[03:56:22.042 --> 03:56:22.342]  I don't know.
[03:56:40.080 --> 03:56:40.740]  Who are we?
[03:56:40.780 --> 03:56:45.962]  The EU is threatening criminal charges against Musk for an interview with our former president.
[03:56:46.503 --> 03:56:51.525]  And we have the UK threatening arrest of American citizens, including Musk.
[03:56:51.885 --> 03:56:54.206]  This is the desperation of tyrants.
[03:56:55.029 --> 03:56:56.210]  Who are on their last legs.
[03:56:56.250 --> 03:56:57.732]  This is not the sign of strength.
[03:56:58.232 --> 03:57:00.614]  This is the sign of extreme weakness.
[03:57:00.695 --> 03:57:15.369]  So, as negative as the tyranny is, the great news is, the halo, or the silver lining is, our enemies are so afraid, Nick, right now, of what Trump had to say tonight, and so afraid of the Great Awakening that's happening.
[03:57:17.362 --> 03:57:40.727]  Yeah, and so we talked about some of the things and, you know, this is something that you hit on a lot, Alex, is, you know, foreign interference and these potentials for, so what we heard in the beginning was that Elon Musk was saying that these were, that there were some bad actors potentially carrying out DDoS attacks on the space today.
[03:57:40.787 --> 03:57:43.008]  Who would have the motivation to do that?
[03:57:43.607 --> 03:57:45.308]  Well, that's a good point.
[03:57:45.328 --> 03:57:49.772]  I mean, we hear all day that the Russians, Russians can't even run their own country.
[03:57:49.832 --> 03:57:52.534]  Nothing against the Russians, but they'll admit we can't run our own country.
[03:57:52.554 --> 03:57:53.455]  We don't want to dominate you.
[03:57:53.475 --> 03:57:54.736]  You're the biggest country in the world.
[03:57:55.236 --> 03:58:00.660]  We have the globalists and Google and big tech openly censoring, openly controlling.
[03:58:01.461 --> 03:58:07.426]  And so here is the EU and the UK threatening Musk, you better not talk to Trump.
[03:58:08.547 --> 03:58:12.330]  Imagine the Streisand effect of that, how desperate they are.
[03:58:13.539 --> 03:58:21.845]  Try to say Elon Musk, one of the most successful inventors in the world and entrepreneurs, can't talk to the former president of the United States.
[03:58:21.905 --> 03:58:26.929]  I mean, it's total desperation, but it really shows these people are dangerous.
[03:58:29.463 --> 03:58:31.244]  Yeah, they are absolutely dangerous.
[03:58:31.304 --> 03:58:34.205]  And, you know, we'll get some thoughts and we'll go around the horn here a little bit.
[03:58:34.225 --> 03:58:37.846]  You know, Alex, feel free to jump in whenever you want to or however you want to.
[03:58:37.906 --> 03:58:46.648]  But, you know, some of the questions that Elon and Trump were talking about in the beginning came to border security here.
[03:58:47.089 --> 03:58:54.711]  And, you know, Elon said at one point that he used to be, you know, at one point he waited in line for six hours just to shake Barack Obama's hand.
[03:58:55.231 --> 03:59:04.418]  Based on this conversation tonight, what do you think it was, what was the catalyst that ended up changing his mind to come out and end up supporting somebody like President Trump now?
[03:59:05.099 --> 03:59:08.781]  Well, Nick, that is a absolutely key question.
[03:59:09.322 --> 03:59:18.289]  And he told people three years ago, two years ago, six months ago, and last week, he said, one of my oldest sons is dead.
[03:59:19.491 --> 03:59:25.774]  I put him in an elite school and they took him away and they told him he was a girl and they sterilized him.
[03:59:26.434 --> 03:59:27.354]  So my son is dead.
[03:59:28.255 --> 03:59:33.237]  And so you would think the left would be smart enough to not go after Elon Musk's son, but it's a cult.
[03:59:34.133 --> 03:59:35.114]  And so they did it.
[03:59:35.634 --> 03:59:38.495]  And so Elon has been bitten by the New World Order.
[03:59:39.075 --> 03:59:40.336]  He has been stung by it.
[03:59:40.376 --> 03:59:46.799]  He has had his son taken away from him and turned into this creature.
[03:59:47.520 --> 03:59:48.840]  And so he's pissed off.
[03:59:48.900 --> 03:59:52.262]  And that's a normal response to being under attack.
[03:59:52.322 --> 03:59:55.063]  So Elon has told us why he's awake.
[03:59:55.684 --> 03:59:57.404]  Elon has told us why he's fighting.
[03:59:57.765 --> 04:00:00.866]  Because his son was murdered by the system.
[04:00:01.226 --> 04:00:02.507]  And it's like Obi-Wan Kenobi says,
[04:00:03.422 --> 04:00:06.347]  You know, Luke Skywalker, your father is dead.
[04:00:06.367 --> 04:00:07.930]  He chose to be Darth Vader.
[04:00:08.270 --> 04:00:09.993]  He became this new thing.
[04:00:10.013 --> 04:00:12.678]  And so that's what's happening.
[04:00:15.365 --> 04:00:27.789]  Yeah, and so when the, say, the New World Order, the globalists and such, and the Deep State in particular, how are they going to end up coming after Elon Musk for something like this?
[04:00:28.089 --> 04:00:35.911]  How are they going to, you know, because he owns one of the, well, actually the largest free speech platform in the world.
[04:00:36.171 --> 04:00:41.633]  You see countries all over the world that are trying to ban it because, you know, people like you and I can speak on here.
[04:00:41.673 --> 04:00:42.613]  You were banned on Twitter 1.0.
[04:00:43.774 --> 04:00:45.115]  You weren't even allowed on this platform.
[04:00:45.155 --> 04:00:51.264]  It took Elon Musk to spend $44 billion for you to come in and be able to just post on X again.
[04:00:52.234 --> 04:00:53.614]  They've told us how they're going to do it.
[04:00:53.994 --> 04:00:56.955]  They have Brazil with criminal investigations and charges.
[04:00:57.415 --> 04:00:58.535]  They have the EU.
[04:00:58.915 --> 04:01:00.135]  They have the UK.
[04:01:00.756 --> 04:01:09.017]  They have the Australian government all saying we're going to arrest Elon Musk, all because he allows people to challenge them, which shows how weak they are.
[04:01:09.097 --> 04:01:19.579]  So they are openly at war with Musk, but Musk had his son taken from him and destroyed and murdered and taken from him.
[04:01:20.515 --> 04:01:35.470]  And then he also sees the attacks, and he also sees the way the wind's blowing, that humanity's fighting, so he's made the decision to say to those that want to take his freedoms away, and those that want to dominate him, and those that want to tell him what to say, go fuck yourselves.
[04:01:36.210 --> 04:01:41.676]  And so, it's that go fuck yourself moment, when they murder your son like in the Patriot.
[04:01:42.523 --> 04:01:49.185]  Mel Gibson movie based on a true story, that you decide that you don't care what they do anymore, you're going to fight them.
[04:01:49.485 --> 04:01:50.705]  So I think that answers the question.
[04:01:52.626 --> 04:01:53.166]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:01:53.186 --> 04:01:54.766]  And Alex, feel free to jump in at any time.
[04:01:54.786 --> 04:01:56.767]  You know, you got co-host powers, you do whatever you want to do.
[04:01:56.807 --> 04:01:59.887]  But we'll get Wall Street Silver in here, another special guest we brought on.
[04:01:59.907 --> 04:02:00.408]  Yeah, bring him in.
[04:02:00.448 --> 04:02:00.968]  I'm right here.
[04:02:01.028 --> 04:02:01.728]  I'm listening.
[04:02:02.668 --> 04:02:02.988]  Perfect.
[04:02:03.008 --> 04:02:03.248]  Perfect.
[04:02:03.268 --> 04:02:03.869]  Wall Street's over.
[04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:04.669]  Welcome to the stage, man.
[04:02:04.709 --> 04:02:05.210]  What are your thoughts?
[04:02:05.810 --> 04:02:14.395]  Well, you know, about the, the other countries that are going after Yvonne, he actually won that legal fight in Australia where they were going after him.
[04:02:14.776 --> 04:02:19.759]  So a lot of these, you know, Australia, the EU, the UK, they're making these attacks on him.
[04:02:20.399 --> 04:02:21.020]  We're good to go.
[04:02:38.061 --> 04:02:40.322]  You know, fuck you money and he can pay the lawyers.
[04:02:40.382 --> 04:02:41.582]  No, I totally agree.
[04:02:41.622 --> 04:02:43.203]  So it's like Wizard of Oz.
[04:02:43.383 --> 04:02:45.164]  It's like Wizard of Oz with Toto.
[04:02:46.364 --> 04:02:49.025]  I'm self-interrupting, but it's like Wizard of Oz with Toto.
[04:02:49.446 --> 04:02:51.446]  You pull back the curtain, it's game over.
[04:02:51.466 --> 04:02:52.627]  I think we're at that moment.
[04:02:52.647 --> 04:02:52.987]  Go ahead.
[04:02:54.288 --> 04:03:02.211]  Yeah, he won it already in Australia and they had to back off on their threats to fine him like, you know, millions of dollars.
[04:03:02.890 --> 04:03:04.050]  So that one's taken care of.
[04:03:04.410 --> 04:03:10.972]  And this threat that this clown in the EU tried to make today, it's in complete violation of EU law.
[04:03:11.053 --> 04:03:15.494]  I mean, the EU has plenty of protections for that.
[04:03:16.734 --> 04:03:18.975]  This guy's completely out on his own on a limb.
[04:03:19.528 --> 04:03:19.908]  We're good to go.
[04:03:50.035 --> 04:03:51.416]  Uh, to go have that battle.
[04:03:51.536 --> 04:03:53.157]  And he's willing to go have that battle.
[04:03:53.878 --> 04:03:56.860]  Um, whereas a lot of other people couldn't even afford the lawyers to go fight it.
[04:03:56.900 --> 04:03:57.300]  No, I agree.
[04:03:57.320 --> 04:03:58.621]  Let me just say this real quick.
[04:03:58.641 --> 04:03:59.802]  Let me just say this and I want you to respond.
[04:04:00.899 --> 04:04:04.100]  I've been on there 30 years, and I've been politically active for 35.
[04:04:04.740 --> 04:04:06.921]  There's all these people that don't believe there's good people.
[04:04:07.341 --> 04:04:09.502]  Everybody dialed in tonight knows you're a real person.
[04:04:09.822 --> 04:04:15.164]  Most of you are good men and women, black, white, old, young, Jewish, you know, Christian, Muslim, whatever you are.
[04:04:16.024 --> 04:04:19.826]  Folks, there's a lot of good people, and Elon is good.
[04:04:20.206 --> 04:04:22.007]  He's proven it by what he's doing.
[04:04:22.047 --> 04:04:23.187]  You can't fake that.
[04:04:23.527 --> 04:04:25.248]  It's irrevocable damage to the tyrants.
[04:04:25.948 --> 04:04:31.591]  And so, to me, we have to understand that we've all been screwed over by this corrupt elite.
[04:04:31.971 --> 04:04:35.813]  We're not offering some utopia once we defeat the current globalists.
[04:04:35.973 --> 04:04:50.180]  I'm not saying it'll be all peaches and cream, but it'll be better than these people that are out to get us when we've got Elon Musk and Donald Trump and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson as the cultural leaders.
[04:04:50.660 --> 04:04:51.761]  And that's all I'm saying is,
[04:04:53.035 --> 04:04:54.938]  Evil doesn't always rule in history.
[04:04:55.438 --> 04:05:01.106]  Good can also be involved, and we've got to decide to do that and have optimism.
[04:05:01.146 --> 04:05:03.529]  That's all I'm saying is that, folks,
[04:05:04.400 --> 04:05:05.161]  This is real.
[04:05:05.861 --> 04:05:07.582]  And I cannot stress that enough.
[04:05:07.602 --> 04:05:13.786]  This is a real pro-human attempt to save humanity because it's common sense.
[04:05:14.307 --> 04:05:19.090]  A real businessman doesn't want a screwed up world, doesn't want war, doesn't want depopulation.
[04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:24.274]  And that's everything Elon's doing to increase the population and fix things.
[04:05:24.394 --> 04:05:26.035]  And so that's where we are.
[04:05:26.375 --> 04:05:28.937]  And I've always bet on humanity for 30 years on air.
[04:05:29.557 --> 04:05:30.837]  I've believed in humanity.
[04:05:30.917 --> 04:05:34.959]  I didn't fight the enemy because I wanted to just go get put in prison or killed.
[04:05:35.439 --> 04:05:37.519]  I've known how strong humanity is.
[04:05:38.039 --> 04:05:39.680]  And I've seen it happen.
[04:05:39.980 --> 04:05:42.441]  So we have to believe in that and believe in God.
[04:05:42.741 --> 04:05:43.661]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[04:05:43.921 --> 04:05:50.303]  But pull back the curtain, see the Wizard of Oz, admit it's a joke, admit it's a fraud, and disempower it.
[04:05:53.106 --> 04:05:59.194]  You know, Alex, on Wall Street, let's consider the significance of what just happened tonight.
[04:05:59.214 --> 04:06:01.297]  The significance of the passage of time?
[04:06:02.038 --> 04:06:08.507]  Well, not just, yeah, not just what you're saying about Elon, Alex, but think about this for a second.
[04:06:08.567 --> 04:06:09.829]  Donald Trump also
[04:06:10.589 --> 04:06:12.231]  Has put everything on the line.
[04:06:12.611 --> 04:06:21.038]  We would not be here where we were tonight if Donald Trump were not willing to stay in the fight at great personal risk.
[04:06:21.239 --> 04:06:34.831]  And by the way, for all the things that people say about him being arrogant and selfish and narcissistic and all this stuff, the entire time that he's been going through this, he has not wined and griped
[04:06:35.331 --> 04:06:35.551]  Right now.
[04:06:51.544 --> 04:06:52.805]  No, but let me interrupt again.
[04:06:52.825 --> 04:06:53.646]  No, exactly.
[04:06:54.026 --> 04:06:58.169]  If you own golf courses and hotels, how do you make money?
[04:06:58.189 --> 04:07:00.471]  I'm not saying you do this from an evil perspective.
[04:07:00.851 --> 04:07:02.152]  You do it through prosperity.
[04:07:02.432 --> 04:07:06.235]  If you're building spaceships to go to Mars, you're pro—exactly.
[04:07:06.515 --> 04:07:07.936]  They need a market.
[04:07:07.976 --> 04:07:15.762]  They're pro-human, whereas the globalists are this weird anti-human depopulation disease that is against us.
[04:07:15.782 --> 04:07:16.423]  Does that make sense?
[04:07:17.919 --> 04:07:18.820]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:07:19.240 --> 04:07:22.903]  But think about the risk these two guys took to get there.
[04:07:23.143 --> 04:07:30.369]  Now, yes, there's a possibility, and it should always be there, for them to be able to expand what they're doing and do much better.
[04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:32.851]  Both of them are in retail-style
[04:07:36.352 --> 04:07:41.793]  Exactly, they're not bankers that live off power and collapse.
[04:07:41.833 --> 04:07:47.434]  Let me ask, I want you to expand, I'm going to shut up, you're a smart caller, or smart ex, I apologize, I'm ranting, but you're so on target.
[04:07:47.855 --> 04:07:55.196]  Finish your point, and then ask the question of what would the globalists do if they were in full control?
[04:07:55.616 --> 04:08:01.517]  Because we can talk about the positive all day, and Trump did that for two hours, we should also talk about the negative.
[04:08:03.246 --> 04:08:04.047]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:08:04.147 --> 04:08:05.667]  Listen, I lived this personally.
[04:08:05.707 --> 04:08:09.430]  My dad had 108 Hardee's restaurants at his height.
[04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:13.152]  I've lived with a businessman that had to deal with these problems.
[04:08:14.893 --> 04:08:18.315]  See, we have turned against prosperity in the West.
[04:08:18.755 --> 04:08:21.196]  We have made prosperity an evil thing.
[04:08:21.517 --> 04:08:27.820]  And there are definitely greedy people who get prosperous, but one of the things that we forget is that... But it still doesn't matter.
[04:08:27.860 --> 04:08:28.921]  It helps everybody.
[04:08:29.998 --> 04:08:35.063]  It does, because, listen, they may be greedy, and God may judge that, but here's the point.
[04:08:35.243 --> 04:08:39.427]  If you are the greediest bastard in the world and you want to be a billionaire, what do you have to do?
[04:08:39.827 --> 04:08:41.128]  You have to follow the golden rule.
[04:08:41.148 --> 04:08:49.636]  You have to treat customers right, you have to treat employees right, you have to build value, and you have to go back to the people that you're serving and do even better.
[04:08:49.756 --> 04:08:52.018]  And Trump knows that from his experiences.
[04:08:52.358 --> 04:08:53.119]  And Trump knows that.
[04:08:55.061 --> 04:08:55.821]  Absolutely.
[04:08:56.081 --> 04:09:01.363]  And so the significance of what we witnessed tonight is profound.
[04:09:01.743 --> 04:09:11.545]  I think sometimes we walk right by it because we see Donald Trump running as a political candidate, and then we see all the chaos around stuff, and we kind of keep thinking about that.
[04:09:11.785 --> 04:09:17.367]  But what we sometimes forget is the chaos is there because there's an assault
[04:09:18.067 --> 04:09:20.388]  And by the way, I totally agree with you.
[04:09:20.528 --> 04:09:22.149]  Let's answer this question and finish your point.
[04:09:22.209 --> 04:09:22.889]  Why are they so scared?
[04:09:22.909 --> 04:09:24.350]  Because they did DDoS attack, they went apeshit.
[04:09:24.370 --> 04:09:26.371]  Why are they so scared of the Elon Musk-Trump combo?
[04:09:26.391 --> 04:09:27.471]  That really scares them.
[04:09:47.523 --> 04:09:50.867]  The reason they're scared is because they're going to lose their incomes.
[04:09:50.887 --> 04:09:52.188]  They're going to lose their power.
[04:09:52.308 --> 04:09:56.593]  They're going to lose their influence because they most people that go into government.
[04:09:57.193 --> 04:10:04.501]  In fact, Ryan Selkis just shared a great graph that shows that JD Vance and Donald Trump
[04:10:04.701 --> 04:10:06.662]  Exactly, they're threatened by innovation.
[04:10:28.514 --> 04:10:29.294]  Exactly.
[04:10:29.654 --> 04:10:34.395]  And that's why this was an incredibly profound space tonight.
[04:10:34.435 --> 04:10:39.936]  I had people saying, oh, all the Trumpsters and the cultists that are listening to Donald Trump.
[04:10:39.976 --> 04:10:48.198]  And listen, there was some good discussion in this, but obviously it wasn't some deep political discussion about policy or whatever.
[04:10:48.478 --> 04:10:48.978]  Whatever.
[04:10:49.278 --> 04:10:51.439]  The American people don't give a damn about policy.
[04:10:51.479 --> 04:10:53.519]  What they want is to be able to live their lives.
[04:10:53.799 --> 04:10:56.700]  And they're looking for people that will give them a chance to
[04:10:56.940 --> 04:11:07.323]  Exactly, and imagine how alien it is to the globalist to hear Trump not talk about himself, but how he wants to empower stuff, because rising tides raise all ships.
[04:11:07.743 --> 04:11:09.303]  Why would we not want prosperity?
[04:11:09.343 --> 04:11:10.403]  We could do anything.
[04:11:13.304 --> 04:11:16.125]  And so here's the thing that I want to get to before we go to other people on the panel.
[04:11:16.145 --> 04:11:21.486]  We have Kyle Becker up here, another special guest, CJ Pearson, Adrian Dittman now, which Alex, I know you like Adrian Dittman.
[04:11:21.526 --> 04:11:23.667]  I know you two are... Let's talk to Adrian.
[04:11:23.707 --> 04:11:24.487]  Bring Adrian up.
[04:11:25.504 --> 04:11:27.385]  Yeah, Adrian's up.
[04:11:28.286 --> 04:11:31.067]  We'll get him in here in just a second, but I want to shout out to the audience here.
[04:11:31.087 --> 04:11:34.269]  Bottom right hand corner, guys, make sure, you know, let me know what you thought.
[04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:42.294]  What was your biggest takeaway from the Elon Donald Trump interview that lasted two hours, uninterrupted, unscripted?
[04:11:42.314 --> 04:11:46.877]  And honestly, I think it was one of the best moves that President Trump has made.
[04:11:47.197 --> 04:11:47.938]  That's my opinion.
[04:11:48.018 --> 04:11:49.178]  It was raw.
[04:11:49.258 --> 04:11:50.339]  It was real.
[04:11:50.539 --> 04:11:51.500]  It was powerful.
[04:11:53.001 --> 04:11:54.022]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:11:54.062 --> 04:11:55.664]  He does this more frequently, for sure.
[04:11:55.925 --> 04:11:59.229]  Like, if he does this more frequently, he would have much more reach than he currently has.
[04:11:59.569 --> 04:12:02.793]  I don't even think a rally can have this kind of impact that he's had right here.
[04:12:03.054 --> 04:12:05.697]  I mean, millions of people were listening to that space.
[04:12:05.757 --> 04:12:10.163]  I can assure you most of those were, in fact, real, given that most of the bots which are probably attacking, you know,
[04:12:10.643 --> 04:12:11.164]  We're good to go.
[04:12:34.718 --> 04:12:35.319]  No, you're right.
[04:12:35.399 --> 04:12:36.140]  You're right, Adrian.
[04:12:36.460 --> 04:12:38.783]  I'll shut up and I want you to speak, but you're right.
[04:12:38.823 --> 04:12:41.867]  This was a mega digital rally, the biggest thing Trump's done basically ever.
[04:12:41.887 --> 04:12:42.548]  Can you speak to that?
[04:12:54.562 --> 04:13:10.850]  Yeah, I mean, this is going to be felt everywhere, because the more people are actually posting about this, now you'll see a next level shift in the algorithm, because the algorithm is always just controlled by the people for what they want to see, and what is being pushed by individual points within the vector space, which is what your accounts all are, especially major accounts.
[04:13:11.271 --> 04:13:18.394]  And so this is just going to go everywhere, even to the people who don't necessarily want to see it, which you could say is kind of like a negative aspect of how algorithms work.
[04:13:18.714 --> 04:13:19.735]  But honestly, I mean, just that's just
[04:13:19.775 --> 04:13:20.095]  I think so.
[04:13:36.403 --> 04:13:36.783]  Wild.
[04:13:37.163 --> 04:13:38.103]  Absolutely wild.
[04:13:38.184 --> 04:13:53.847]  And Adrian, to kind of get to your point, you know, I'll give it back to Alex here in just a second, but the space link that was posted, you know, as soon as the space launched has 71 million views on President Trump's ex piece.
[04:13:53.867 --> 04:13:59.629]  Yeah, Adrian, why do you think the power structure, why do you think the power structure, Adrian, was so scared of this interview?
[04:14:02.122 --> 04:14:07.809]  I mean, how many people who are on the fence are now kind of, like, erring towards Trump, in a sense?
[04:14:08.029 --> 04:14:11.233]  Because this made him look very, very human, in a sense, right?
[04:14:11.513 --> 04:14:14.036]  I've always said this, I think, about spaces, you know, people should do these more often.
[04:14:14.176 --> 04:14:15.518]  It was like a fireside chat.
[04:14:15.958 --> 04:14:16.319]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:14:16.379 --> 04:14:17.180]  Fireside chat.
[04:14:18.060 --> 04:14:30.129]  Yeah, it was nice because it actually showed the human side, because everything normally, when a politician is at a rally or when they're speaking in Congress or whatever else, kind of a professional setting, you don't actually see the human side of them.
[04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:42.257]  And to see, say, someone like Donald Trump, who we assume is like some sort of different figure that's associated with the real world, to see him in a real-world scenario, have a normal conversation, actually function
[04:14:43.161 --> 04:14:47.823]  Functionally have a normal conversation is something that I think is really important, especially for him.
[04:14:48.583 --> 04:15:04.910]  And you can clearly see that there was a nice dynamic because Elon was 100% awake with everything that Donald Trump was saying, which I personally have not usually seen with interviews other than, say, with Alex Friedman and potentially even with Jordan Peterson, even though he dropped it a little bit.
[04:15:04.930 --> 04:15:06.231]  But it was interesting still.
[04:15:06.795 --> 04:15:07.957]  But yeah, very fascinating.
[04:15:08.317 --> 04:15:14.085]  So, Adrian, what was your biggest takeaways from this epic Elon Musk interview with Donald Trump?
[04:15:17.489 --> 04:15:19.211]  I mean, honestly, there were so many cool moments.
[04:15:19.291 --> 04:15:20.473]  I kind of posted a few of those.
[04:15:20.493 --> 04:15:22.335]  I think
[04:15:23.889 --> 04:15:32.175]  One of the major ones is of course, you know, having, not wanting, I mean, not really there being an option to have a conversation with Biden or Kamala.
[04:15:32.195 --> 04:15:33.436]  I think this is like a huge negative.
[04:15:33.556 --> 04:15:43.943]  I really hope that there will be a conversation because just to make it fair, but I doubt that they would do something like that because you can't actually script a conversation like this with a person like
[04:15:44.563 --> 04:15:45.344]  It was an epic interview.
[04:15:45.384 --> 04:15:47.526]  I mean, clearly the whole world's turning towards freedom.
[04:15:47.546 --> 04:15:48.287]  Elon realizes that.
[04:16:07.820 --> 04:16:19.007]  What do you, Adrian, you're a smart guy, what do you think the next threat to Elon Musk is with the EU, the UK, Brazil, Australia, all calling for his arrest?
[04:16:20.088 --> 04:16:23.250]  Why do you think Elon has made this decision to go full-on against him?
[04:16:25.569 --> 04:16:30.591]  I think this is like one of the last dominoes that can fall in either direction.
[04:16:30.871 --> 04:16:35.993]  This is like a tipping point in time, and it has to go a certain way, otherwise everything goes full dystopian.
[04:16:36.033 --> 04:16:39.755]  This is what I would at least assume, because that's what the pattern looks like.
[04:16:39.775 --> 04:16:53.861]  In every moment in history, there's always a tipping point where you can err in any direction, this being positive or negative, and this leads to a decision tree that eventually errs right back to something more positive, as the universe tends to somehow demand balance, which is weird.
[04:16:54.321 --> 04:16:57.883]  But that's kind of like how fractal reality seems to work because I think it's actually like fractal.
[04:16:58.224 --> 04:17:01.526]  So I mean, this is necessary.
[04:17:01.606 --> 04:17:02.446]  Someone had to do it.
[04:17:02.786 --> 04:17:05.188]  And I think those two are basically trying to do it.
[04:17:05.708 --> 04:17:06.589]  And look, if say,
[04:17:08.178 --> 04:17:10.279]  Someone like Donald Trump, for instance, is kind of like on him now.
[04:17:10.299 --> 04:17:15.722]  He has to make sure that he stays a civilized person because otherwise he will lose, right?
[04:17:16.102 --> 04:17:16.602]  That's the thing.
[04:17:16.622 --> 04:17:18.263]  You should not underestimate Kamala.
[04:17:18.483 --> 04:17:20.824]  You should not underestimate her marketing team.
[04:17:20.984 --> 04:17:23.105]  They are very capable people.
[04:17:23.345 --> 04:17:27.627]  I think she actually does have a fair shot because a lot of young people actually associate themselves with Kamala.
[04:17:28.007 --> 04:17:35.010]  You know, marketing is really easy, Adrian, when you blatantly lie to people and nobody holds you accountable.
[04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.871]  So, yeah.
[04:17:36.131 --> 04:17:37.031]  Great marketing team.
[04:17:37.051 --> 04:17:37.672]  You're 100% correct.
[04:17:37.712 --> 04:17:39.092]  Well, yeah, of course.
[04:17:39.292 --> 04:17:40.913]  But that's marketing itself.
[04:17:40.953 --> 04:17:44.675]  So, Adrian, you're a smart guy.
[04:17:44.695 --> 04:17:45.415]  Let me ask you this.
[04:17:45.475 --> 04:17:48.056]  What would your advice to President Trump be, Adrian Devin?
[04:17:49.957 --> 04:17:51.098]  Oh, I have no advice whatsoever.
[04:17:51.118 --> 04:17:52.839]  I'm just a random guy with a space PFP.
[04:17:52.859 --> 04:17:53.759]  I know nothing.
[04:17:55.428 --> 04:18:01.551]  So what I want to do real quick, before we get to CJ Pearson and Kyle Becker we have up here today, as well as JR Majewski, all special guests, really appreciate you being here.
[04:18:01.591 --> 04:18:04.773]  I want to ask something that the audience reminded me of.
[04:18:04.813 --> 04:18:09.415]  They reminded me of my own post that I made earlier, and I thought it was a good one to bring up to you, Alex.
[04:18:09.455 --> 04:18:10.436]  I don't know if you saw this,
[04:18:11.036 --> 04:18:11.316]  Sure, sure.
[04:18:11.336 --> 04:18:11.796]  Let me be clear.
[04:18:11.816 --> 04:18:12.056]  I did see it.
[04:18:35.524 --> 04:18:38.145]  I wouldn't say they're desperate, not ballsy.
[04:18:38.965 --> 04:18:43.806]  So, they threatened Elon Musk today with the EU sanctions.
[04:18:44.346 --> 04:18:46.187]  So, that's not a sign of strength.
[04:18:46.987 --> 04:18:48.947]  Why would they be scared of Elon Musk talking to Trump?
[04:18:48.967 --> 04:18:51.508]  Let me ask Adrian that, or ask all your viewers.
[04:18:51.868 --> 04:18:52.748]  I can get my answer.
[04:18:53.169 --> 04:18:55.629]  But that is not a sign of strength, Adrian Dittman.
[04:18:55.649 --> 04:18:57.290]  Does that sound like strength?
[04:18:57.310 --> 04:19:01.131]  They want to arrest Elon Musk for interviewing Trump?
[04:19:01.431 --> 04:19:02.351]  Aren't we in a free country?
[04:19:07.547 --> 04:19:09.889]  I don't know if Adrian heard that or not, but let's go to Kyle.
[04:19:09.909 --> 04:19:10.730]  You want to take that one?
[04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.951]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[04:19:14.133 --> 04:19:17.817]  No, we're not really in a free country right now, but we're trying to change that.
[04:19:17.997 --> 04:19:22.761]  But the thing I heard with the space is to get back to what you were talking about earlier, Alex.
[04:19:22.801 --> 04:19:25.864]  Why are they so afraid of Elon Musk talking with Donald Trump?
[04:19:26.614 --> 04:19:31.917]  They are bigger than just a couple of politicians talking.
[04:19:32.357 --> 04:19:38.240]  These are billionaires, they're self-made men to a large extent, and they're builders.
[04:19:39.816 --> 04:19:51.243]  What they signal to the rest of the world is not just a populist movement, but it's kind of a wake-up call to other billionaires, other elites out there.
[04:19:51.263 --> 04:19:58.807]  They could scapegoat Donald Trump and put him in a little box and say, oh, he's just a firebrand.
[04:19:59.227 --> 04:20:01.508]  But they can't do that with Elon Musk.
[04:20:01.949 --> 04:20:06.071]  So I think the signal to other elites right now is that
[04:20:06.716 --> 04:20:10.658]  You know, whether it be Peter Thiel, you know, and obviously the J.D.
[04:20:10.718 --> 04:20:12.078]  Vance connection there.
[04:20:13.139 --> 04:20:19.401]  I think that we're going to need more people like Elon Musk who just show bravery.
[04:20:19.421 --> 04:20:25.043]  And I think like Trump's obviously has raised fists, yelling fight, fight, fight is the iconic symbol of that.
[04:20:26.704 --> 04:20:27.624]  Just to say like, look,
[04:20:29.477 --> 04:20:36.802]  You know, if you really want to be someone who influences the world for good, you need to be on this side.
[04:20:36.842 --> 04:20:38.524]  You need to join this coalition.
[04:20:38.924 --> 04:20:40.445]  You need to ally with us.
[04:20:40.925 --> 04:20:47.950]  And don't let the Soros's of the world, the Klaus Schwab's of the world dictate the future.
[04:20:48.231 --> 04:20:50.652]  We need to form a coalition with real power.
[04:20:50.672 --> 04:20:51.853]  No, I totally agree.
[04:20:51.873 --> 04:20:56.156]  This insane globalist program of death has to come to an end.
[04:20:58.646 --> 04:21:01.188]  I'm not somebody that just joins something to promote it, whatever.
[04:21:01.248 --> 04:21:03.129]  I don't get paid by Elon Musk to do any of this.
[04:21:03.769 --> 04:21:06.030]  Elon Musk is at war with the globalists, so is Trump.
[04:21:06.170 --> 04:21:06.651]  I backed him.
[04:21:07.231 --> 04:21:10.013]  And they're pro-human, and so that's where I'm at.
[04:21:10.373 --> 04:21:11.774]  But this is an epic moment.
[04:21:11.814 --> 04:21:17.937]  I want the average viewer or listener right now to realize, as I roll my sleeves up, that this is a big deal you just saw.
[04:21:18.558 --> 04:21:23.781]  I mean, we are witnessing titans of industry who are pro-human
[04:21:25.393 --> 04:21:26.453]  Inter-expansionist.
[04:21:27.114 --> 04:21:28.134]  Human expansionist.
[04:21:28.174 --> 04:21:32.795]  Like, in fact, I was thinking today, like, I want to create a website about human expansionism.
[04:21:33.435 --> 04:21:38.057]  I mean, this is an epic moment.
[04:21:38.797 --> 04:21:41.618]  And we have to decide, are we pro-human or are we anti-human?
[04:21:42.058 --> 04:21:43.599]  And the anti-humans are a joke.
[04:21:44.239 --> 04:21:45.099]  They've got to be blocked.
[04:21:45.119 --> 04:21:45.999]  They've got to be stopped.
[04:21:46.059 --> 04:21:49.981]  I mean, it's such a simple answer if you're pro-human.
[04:21:50.041 --> 04:21:51.221]  And dammit, I'm human.
[04:21:51.840 --> 04:21:56.325]  And my parents, their grandparents, their parents before them were great people.
[04:21:56.345 --> 04:22:01.831]  We're not going to just turn the planet over to a bunch of technocrats that hate people and want to cut our son's genitals off.
[04:22:03.013 --> 04:22:05.035]  And so at the end of the day, if they want a war, they got one.
[04:22:05.055 --> 04:22:05.656]  That's what I'm saying.
[04:22:07.065 --> 04:22:22.129]  Yeah, and it doesn't hurt that Elon Musk is one of the biggest tech geniuses out there on our side, so that definitely helps, you know, in this AI, you know, shaped future that we're heading into, to have one of the brightest guys on our side, you know, calling BS on, like, checks.
[04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:30.392]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's not about groveling to Elon Musk, except when you've got a weapon neutralizing the enemy, devastating the enemy,
[04:22:31.693 --> 04:22:32.774]  You should love the weapon.
[04:22:51.992 --> 04:22:54.493]  Devastating the current corrupt New World Order.
[04:22:54.713 --> 04:22:58.835]  Now if he turns on us and does something bad a year from now, I'll attack him day one.
[04:22:59.175 --> 04:22:59.455]  Boom.
[04:22:59.835 --> 04:23:01.756]  One second in, he's not.
[04:23:02.176 --> 04:23:06.678]  And this commitment he's done needs to be supported.
[04:23:07.339 --> 04:23:09.480]  And so people need to not be squeamish about this.
[04:23:09.960 --> 04:23:14.822]  If you want to win, folks, and turn stuff around, back Trump, back Elon Musk, and do it now.
[04:23:16.693 --> 04:23:17.433]  So I want to go real quick.
[04:23:17.453 --> 04:23:19.854]  I want to go to CJ Pearson, who we have up here on stage as well.
[04:23:19.894 --> 04:23:23.095]  Definitely, as I said, CJ, thank you so much for being here.
[04:23:23.596 --> 04:23:29.438]  And CJ, you are, just to remind the new audience, we've got like 18,000 live listeners right now.
[04:23:30.178 --> 04:23:33.279]  You're the co-chair of the GOP Youth Advisory Council.
[04:23:33.299 --> 04:23:36.220]  So, you know, you have the ability to make an impact
[04:23:36.400 --> 04:23:36.540]  Yeah.
[04:23:54.206 --> 04:23:54.827]  I don't know.
[04:24:17.098 --> 04:24:21.701]  No, it definitely does resonate as a testament to the political genius of President Trump.
[04:24:21.721 --> 04:24:27.124]  But this is a guy who is literally willing to go wherever anyone is and meet them where they are.
[04:24:27.164 --> 04:24:28.865]  And he's done it in such a great way.
[04:24:28.885 --> 04:24:37.290]  You know, while there were so many establishment Republicans who were, you know, sounding the alarm about TikTok and whatnot, President Trump said, there are a lot of young people there.
[04:24:37.330 --> 04:24:38.510]  Let me go make a TikTok.
[04:24:38.530 --> 04:24:40.932]  And now he's one of the most viral people on the entire app.
[04:24:41.312 --> 04:24:41.993]  We're good to go.
[04:25:01.128 --> 04:25:01.548]  I think so.
[04:25:21.838 --> 04:25:22.238]  I think so.
[04:25:39.844 --> 04:25:43.787]  You saw the people with the Trump flags, and you saw the pro-Palestinian people.
[04:25:44.108 --> 04:25:48.071]  The only thing they could agree on is their chance of F Joe Biden.
[04:25:48.291 --> 04:25:54.816]  That is what President Biden and Kamala Harris as well are going to be up against come November, and it's a great thing.
[04:25:55.277 --> 04:25:58.459]  The Dems are in complete disarray, but so is the media.
[04:25:59.340 --> 04:26:04.684]  The media should be the ones pounding the alarm right now and saying, why will Kamala Harris not speak to us?
[04:26:04.784 --> 04:26:05.825]  Why will they ignore us?
[04:26:06.125 --> 04:26:08.948]  But instead, you have that hack over at CNN
[04:26:10.249 --> 04:26:17.352]  Jim Schudo is talking about, well, it's not an interview if the person conducting it is a donor.
[04:26:17.412 --> 04:26:18.232]  Well, that's right.
[04:26:18.272 --> 04:26:19.432]  Let me just say this.
[04:26:20.313 --> 04:26:22.874]  We have the old guard coming to an end.
[04:26:22.954 --> 04:26:27.335]  Doesn't mean we're offering utopia or that we're perfect, but we're not out to get the people we're pro-human.
[04:26:27.915 --> 04:26:33.597]  And so their old system is coming to an end right now, and they're going to be very violent.
[04:26:33.617 --> 04:26:34.718]  They're going to try to start wars.
[04:26:35.558 --> 04:26:38.641]  But the point is, their system is coming to an end.
[04:26:38.681 --> 04:26:43.907]  It's up to us to then design the new future and try to get people on board for that.
[04:26:44.388 --> 04:26:47.751]  So I just want to say, the New World Order will never come back together.
[04:26:48.152 --> 04:26:48.873]  It will never win.
[04:26:48.913 --> 04:26:49.854]  It's like Humpty Dumpty.
[04:26:51.115 --> 04:26:52.797]  But it's a very dangerous time.
[04:26:55.420 --> 04:26:55.880]  Well said.
[04:26:56.020 --> 04:26:56.361]  Well said.
[04:26:58.869 --> 04:27:00.871]  Yeah, and so we'll jump down here a little bit.
[04:27:00.891 --> 04:27:01.812]  We'll go to J.R.
[04:27:01.832 --> 04:27:02.232]  Majewski.
[04:27:02.273 --> 04:27:15.205]  We'll jump into—there have been—look, there was a lot of the conversation between Elon Musk and President Trump tonight that had to do with energy, and nuclear energy was one of those things.
[04:27:15.266 --> 04:27:22.232]  And, you know, J.R., I know you're big into nuclear energy and stuff, so I'll give you like a minute or two to kind of
[04:27:23.317 --> 04:27:24.638]  Go over that conversation.
[04:27:24.698 --> 04:27:26.179]  Is Trump on point here?
[04:27:26.579 --> 04:27:33.022]  What is the difference between what Kamala Harris is—well, actually, we don't know what she's proposing, so I guess I can't say that.
[04:27:33.562 --> 04:27:41.886]  But what—we're just going to have to go off of what they've done with the Biden administration—versus what President Trump is thinking of doing here, what he proposed tonight.
[04:27:42.206 --> 04:27:44.267]  Because energy prices are through the roof.
[04:27:44.287 --> 04:27:45.688]  We used to be energy independent.
[04:27:45.708 --> 04:27:47.849]  We're no longer energy independent anymore.
[04:27:48.370 --> 04:27:51.231]  What were Trump and Elon discussing about this tonight?
[04:27:52.125 --> 04:27:59.529]  Well, I think, Nick, if I just give you my takeaways, because, I mean, Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, they want nothing to do with nuclear power because they're not making money off of it.
[04:27:59.929 --> 04:28:04.032]  Well, they're starting to, but hopefully... Hunter Biden's not making his money on nuclear?
[04:28:04.812 --> 04:28:16.879]  Well, hopefully we're going to pull that away, but I think tonight, just listening to the President talk, and, you know, he's displaying a fundamental understanding of how energy impacts American sovereignty.
[04:28:17.419 --> 04:28:25.666]  Specifically how energy prices are driving the economy and the direct correlation that we see between energy costs and the consumer impact by way of inflation.
[04:28:26.326 --> 04:28:29.909]  And he's one of the only presidents that's recognized that.
[04:28:30.069 --> 04:28:31.390]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[04:28:31.451 --> 04:28:32.491]  Trump made the key point.
[04:28:33.092 --> 04:28:36.074]  You cut energy prices, that lowers inflation.
[04:28:37.255 --> 04:28:41.038]  Fertilizer, oil, gas, I mean that's it.
[04:28:41.318 --> 04:28:42.179]  You've got to lower that.
[04:28:42.239 --> 04:28:44.561]  And it's historic, right?
[04:28:44.721 --> 04:28:46.663]  And so next I think
[04:28:47.415 --> 04:28:52.018]  The recognition that nuclear power has an important role to play.
[04:28:52.878 --> 04:29:00.143]  I'm sure many of you guys on the call here don't understand this, but right now, the United States is entirely dependent on foreign nations for our uranium supply.
[04:29:00.823 --> 04:29:06.527]  And that means if Russia or France decide to... Does that not seem like a massive national security issue?
[04:29:06.947 --> 04:29:07.807]  It absolutely is.
[04:29:08.188 --> 04:29:10.649]  And Congress is implicit, okay?
[04:29:10.689 --> 04:29:13.111]  So, I can tell you that I've been reviewing legislation.
[04:29:13.271 --> 04:29:15.012]  You know, that's like the U.S.
[04:29:15.072 --> 04:29:16.793]  had to buy its uranium from Russia, remember?
[04:29:17.924 --> 04:29:19.305]  Yeah, and we're still doing that.
[04:29:19.385 --> 04:29:30.190]  And in fact, Congress just passed legislation that starting this month, any American utility that wants to buy uranium from a non-American company has to seek a waiver.
[04:29:30.470 --> 04:29:32.551]  And it's an arduous process.
[04:29:32.671 --> 04:29:36.552]  It's actually stupid, but hey, I mean, that's what Congress is.
[04:29:36.913 --> 04:29:37.713]  We're used to that, right?
[04:29:38.193 --> 04:29:46.737]  But if Russia or France cuts their supply chain, our country would only have maybe a year's worth of capability to sustain base load power.
[04:29:47.478 --> 04:29:49.381]  And here's another thing.
[04:29:49.761 --> 04:29:49.921]  U.S.
[04:29:49.981 --> 04:29:58.132]  reactors right now are only using 10% of the nuclear energy potential in the reactors before they remove that fuel and they place it into long-term storage.
[04:29:58.872 --> 04:30:02.317]  So we're missing out on 90% of the fuel's energy potential.
[04:30:02.998 --> 04:30:04.640]  And I mean, this is a global issue, but
[04:30:04.960 --> 04:30:05.580]  Absolutely.
[04:30:05.600 --> 04:30:07.641]  The United States has been shut down for business.
[04:30:07.662 --> 04:30:09.803]  And if we got Trump in there, he would turn it all around.
[04:30:34.969 --> 04:30:42.415]  But I think my frustration, not necessarily frustration, I mean, you know, I'm working my way to get into the Presidents here.
[04:30:42.455 --> 04:30:43.996]  He knows that I knew nuclear power.
[04:30:44.016 --> 04:30:45.797]  He knows I'm an advocate and I'm a loyal guy to him.
[04:30:47.178 --> 04:30:56.306]  You would think, JR, that the people that are parroting global warming and climate change and stuff, they would be all over nuclear power, but that's not the case.
[04:30:56.366 --> 04:30:59.268]  I mean, are you saying that's because there's not enough money to be made?
[04:30:59.768 --> 04:31:01.569]  I think it goes deeper into that.
[04:31:01.609 --> 04:31:05.231]  I mean, I think there's... There's a post-industrial plan.
[04:31:06.091 --> 04:31:11.774]  Yes, and I think Alex would probably have a hell of a better perspective than I would on that.
[04:31:11.814 --> 04:31:15.015]  But, you know, it really all falls into the grand scheme, right?
[04:31:15.535 --> 04:31:18.377]  And the only way we're going to get out of this is if we streamline the industry.
[04:31:18.657 --> 04:31:22.899]  And right now... The bottom line is the ruling elite do not want
[04:31:23.499 --> 04:31:25.760]  An upwardly mobile, prosperous civilization.
[04:31:26.200 --> 04:31:27.520]  They want neo-feudalism.
[04:31:27.580 --> 04:31:28.740]  It's their official policy.
[04:31:29.761 --> 04:31:33.842]  It's like space aliens had a plan to program people to destroy us.
[04:31:34.282 --> 04:31:35.702]  They don't want prosperity.
[04:31:35.722 --> 04:31:41.304]  They're killing all the infrastructure, the fertilizer, the fossil fuels, the nuclear.
[04:31:41.704 --> 04:31:43.705]  They're flipping switches.
[04:31:43.765 --> 04:31:45.365]  Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
[04:31:45.685 --> 04:31:46.986]  They're literally turning it off, folks.
[04:31:49.693 --> 04:32:00.459]  Yeah, we have next-generation reactors that have been, you know, that have been designed and innovated by Americans and that are being sold in Korea, in China, because the U.S.
[04:32:00.519 --> 04:32:02.300]  regulator will not allow them to exist here.
[04:32:02.860 --> 04:32:05.221]  And again, reprocessing nuclear fuel.
[04:32:05.441 --> 04:32:06.402]  We should be doing that.
[04:32:06.582 --> 04:32:08.003]  There's American innovators right now.
[04:32:08.023 --> 04:32:11.164]  No, exactly, because the deal's been made to no production here.
[04:32:12.445 --> 04:32:12.645]  Right.
[04:32:12.905 --> 04:32:14.486]  Unless you're paying to play.
[04:32:14.826 --> 04:32:16.387]  And right now we have
[04:32:17.645 --> 04:32:27.931]  A company that is owned by the government of France that works under these false auspices of an American company, and they have, I mean, a lockdown on the legislature.
[04:32:27.951 --> 04:32:30.832]  Oh yeah, France is the nuclear power, as you know.
[04:32:31.593 --> 04:32:36.615]  Why do you think France, in the globalist scheme, has been chosen as the real nuclear power in the West?
[04:32:38.696 --> 04:32:39.017]  I don't know.
[04:32:41.087 --> 04:32:41.788]  I don't know.
[04:32:41.808 --> 04:32:42.208]  I haven't.
[04:32:42.288 --> 04:32:51.932]  I've been so embedded with the industry and trying to focus on, you know, working out these kinks that I haven't really given it a glance at a higher level.
[04:32:52.172 --> 04:33:01.816]  And, I mean, I would just think that they're all in cahoots to ensure that the establishment has total control over our energy worldwide.
[04:33:01.956 --> 04:33:07.078]  I mean, when we look at the problems that the country's facing, we can't fix any one of them if we can't turn the lights on.
[04:33:08.687 --> 04:33:10.850]  Yeah, and so what I want to do... Yeah, go ahead.
[04:33:10.930 --> 04:33:11.571]  Actually, go ahead, Alex.
[04:33:11.631 --> 04:33:11.811]  Go ahead.
[04:33:12.012 --> 04:33:14.956]  No, just... My crew's been here since 6am.
[04:33:15.677 --> 04:33:17.319]  Nick, your show is incredible.
[04:33:17.419 --> 04:33:18.500]  Your crew is incredible.
[04:33:18.961 --> 04:33:19.802]  Trump was amazing.
[04:33:19.822 --> 04:33:21.004]  Elon was amazing today.
[04:33:21.524 --> 04:33:24.669]  I'm gonna let you guys... Maybe in my car when I'm driving home, I'll...
[04:33:25.149 --> 04:33:28.231]  I'm gonna dial in and maybe I'll be a speaker then, but I gotta go.
[04:33:28.651 --> 04:33:33.755]  The crew has been here 16 hours, so I'm gonna duck out of here, but I'll still keep listening.
[04:33:33.775 --> 04:33:38.758]  I'll try to be a speaker once I'm on the phone in the car, but I love you guys, and God bless you.
[04:33:40.239 --> 04:33:40.619]  Sounds good.
[04:33:40.659 --> 04:33:41.339]  We'll be here, Alex.
[04:33:41.359 --> 04:33:41.660]  Thank you.
[04:33:41.680 --> 04:33:42.340]  Appreciate it, man.
[04:33:43.101 --> 04:33:43.641]  Very dear for me.
[04:33:43.861 --> 04:33:45.382]  Ryan Fornier, to bring you in here.
[04:33:45.402 --> 04:33:46.683]  You're the chair of Students for Trump.
[04:33:47.829 --> 04:33:50.311]  And yeah, I know you listened to that entire thing tonight.
[04:33:50.331 --> 04:33:56.435]  Two hours uninterrupted of President Trump and Elon Musk live on an X space.
[04:33:56.775 --> 04:33:58.997]  Regardless of all the problems, they pushed through it.
[04:33:59.277 --> 04:34:00.137]  They made it happen.
