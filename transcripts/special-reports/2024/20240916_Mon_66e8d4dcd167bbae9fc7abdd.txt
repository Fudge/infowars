[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.470]  This is breaking news.
[00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:17.863]  The local sheriff in Florida over the jurisdiction, the FBI and Secret Service are all saying it was a very serious assassination attempt yesterday and that they're looking at and they believe that the attempted assassin may have had help because of a lot of different issues we'll break down in a moment.
[00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:38.863]  But, researching this, we began to ask ourselves, who's around Trump that can't be trusted when Trump made the snap decision to go play golf, who could have leaked the information to a federal agency or group, like the CIA, that we know the shooter was highly connected to, so he would know to be on the hunt, because Trump indeed was playing golf.
[00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:41.584]  That person, of course, is Lindsey Graham.
[00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.544]  We're about to break it down right now.
[00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:45.645]  So, my day started
[00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:54.909]  I did Fox News Sunday, and right after the show, President Trump called, and he was about to go play golf with Steve Woodcock.
[00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:56.490]  And, you know, I couldn't get there.
[00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.332]  I was supposed to play, but I couldn't get down.
[00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:04.416]  And he said, you know, we talked, talked a little bit about politics.
[00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.997]  And I said, well, just forget about all that.
[00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:07.658]  Go enjoy yourself.
[00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:09.279]  Have a good round of golf.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.785]  Now, before we plunge into this report, I want to address something going on with the corporate press right now, the enemy of the people.
[00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:21.249]  CNN, ABC News, NBC, every channel, it's everywhere, is saying Trump needs to lower the rhetoric.
[00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.036]  Republicans need to lower the rhetoric of America being an existential threat because it's his fault that this second assassin tried this.
[00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:31.118]  And even MSNBC said he had it coming.
[00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:34.981]  The Democrat rhetoric is a hundred times more aggressive than Trump.
[00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:44.508]  I could play you an hour-long compilation of people like Phil Mudd, who directed a division of the CIA overseas assassinations, saying the government's going to kill Trump.
[00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:47.350]  In fact, I will at the end of this report.
[00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.436]  So remember, while they're saying all of this and acting like they're not involved in these assassination attempts, they're publicly everywhere saying government's going to kill this guy.
[00:01:55.777 --> 00:01:58.699]  So that's coming up after this breakdown on Lindsey Graham.
[00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:03.476]  We do not know, again, the source of any gunshot or gunshots.
[00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.958]  We don't know who's responsible for this.
[00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:12.062]  The whole thing has yet to be 100% confirmed from start to finish, how this all played out.
[00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:22.489]  But do you expect to hear anything from the Trump campaign about toning down the rhetoric, toning down the violence, or would that be atypical of the former president?
[00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:28.153]  How dangerous are these Trump comments during this already rather tense moment for the country?
[00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:30.358]  Very.
[00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:41.480]  And look, I agree with the ecumenical sentiment that rhetoric and words matter and that we should tone down the divisive rhetoric.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.581]  However, as Gloria is pointing out, you can't have it both ways.
[00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:56.243]  You can't say that threats, bomb threats on Springfield, Ohio schools and hospitals have nothing to do with Trump and the Trump campaign.
[00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:59.124]  You can't say Trump has no responsibility.
[00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:12.913]  For an attack on Paul Pelosi, no responsibility for Jan 6th, no responsibility for threats against election workers, no responsibility for threats against Dr. Fauci and health administrators.
[00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.234]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:23.417]  So the calls to tone down are good, but they need to come from inside the house.
[00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:29.490]  Today's apparent assassination attempt comes amid increasingly fierce rhetoric on the campaign trail itself.
[00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.091]  Mr. Trump is running mate.
[00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:31.531]  J.D.
[00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:36.235]  Vance continued to make baseless claims about Haitian immigrants in Ohio.
[00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.398]  This weekend there were new bomb threats in that town.
[00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:45.163]  Our Maggie Vesta is in Columbus, Ohio with more.
[00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:06.874]  We know that Ryan Wesley Ralph is a hardcore leftist, anti-Trump maniac.
[00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.595]  He had tons of Facebook and X posts.
[00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:12.416]  They tried to erase them, but everybody copied them.
[00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:13.076]  It's on record.
[00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:17.318]  He wrote a book talking about how he wanted to assassinate Trump and how he wants a nuclear war.
[00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:20.319]  A complete maniac leftist.
[00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:34.474]  And now even the sheriff's department there in Florida, where the attempted assassination happened yesterday on the golf course, has said evidence points towards the fact that he had help and that other people were giving him information.
[00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:43.898]  And now, of course, we've had a lot of experts come out like Eric Prince and say, you cannot have the same DHS over the secret service in
[00:04:49.224 --> 00:04:55.088]  But then we got a tip this morning pointing out that we should investigate Lindsey Graham and see if he was involved because Lindsey Graham
[00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:22.427]  With his boss previously, John McCain, were the people in the last really 12, 13 years that set up
[00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.170]  They're a fight, it's our fight.
[00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.246]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:08.290]  All of us will go back to Washington and we will push the case against Russia.
[00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.113]  To President Trump and anybody else, if we pull the plug on Ukraine, that's 10 times worse than Afghanistan.
[00:06:15.273 --> 00:06:16.274]  There goes Taiwan.
[00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:19.815]  To stop funding Ukraine is a death sentence for Taiwan.
[00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:20.956]  Putin will keep going.
[00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:22.597]  Graham acts like he's Trump's
[00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:24.867]  Friend at time and time again.
[00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:29.129]  So Rob Dews, running camera right now, said, yeah, let me look into Lindsey Graham.
[00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:41.835]  And sure enough, found out that Lindsey Graham went on Fox News today, this morning, and lo and behold, talked about how he got a call that morning from Trump that he was going to do a surprise golf
[00:06:43.134 --> 00:06:44.455]  So, my day started.
[00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:49.518]  I did Fox News Sunday, and right after the show, President Trump called, and he was about to go play golf with Steve Woodcock.
[00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.739]  And, you know, I couldn't get there.
[00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:54.301]  I was supposed to play, but I couldn't get down.
[00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:18.057]  And he said, um, you know, we talked, talked a little bit about politics and I said, well, just forget about all that.
[00:07:18.097 --> 00:07:19.037]  Go enjoy yourself.
[00:07:19.337 --> 00:07:20.377]  Have a good round of golf.
[00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:32.081]  So later on, not a couple hours later, whenever it was, he called me and he said, Hey, I'm around surrounded by like 500 cops.
[00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:34.121]  Uh, they got a guy with an AK 47.
[00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:41.555]  He didn't know the real details, but shots were fired.
[00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:48.180]  He praised the Secret Service, but they had had him taken off the course.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.942]  And he said, there's like 500 cops around.
[00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:52.063]  I said, are you OK?
[00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.044]  And he says, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:56.306]  He said, I was 200 after five.
[00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.868]  So he's quite a guy.
[00:07:58.908 --> 00:08:00.028]  That's all I can say.
[00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.910]  And I'm just very grateful.
[00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:07.213]  That the worst didn't happen, and I'm pissed that this could happen again.
[00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:14.877]  And what you said about lowering the rhetoric and engaging differently is absolutely essential.
[00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:23.209]  I am not on the one hand surprised at all that he would tell you that he was 2-1 or golfers are just different.
[00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:25.370]  You and I have both played this course.
[00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.731]  We have played it with him.
[00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:37.498]  I noticed while we were playing that it is incredibly hard to keep someone from shooting someone if they are heck bent on doing so, but it sounds to me like
[00:08:38.298 --> 00:08:47.047]  For a guy that survived two attempts on his life in two months, he seems to be handling it a lot better than I would be handling it.
[00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:49.870]  I've never met anybody quite like him.
[00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.214]  He was in good spirits.
[00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:58.578]  The news had not broke.
[00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:00.300]  He called me and said, you're going to hear it in a minute.
[00:09:02.674 --> 00:09:04.675]  OK, and it's kind of hard to absorb that.
[00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:10.558]  So you're getting calls from President Trump about an attempt on his life before it even breaks.
[00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:12.239]  He said he was 200.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.721]  I played there a bunch with him, so have you.
[00:09:15.161 --> 00:09:21.825]  You know, you start off and you go around the corner there and you get close to the road and the highway, that part three.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.002]  So that makes him a suspect for possibly being involved giving intel.
[00:09:37.773 --> 00:09:42.257]  Because we know Graham and the neocons and the Democrats, who they work with, want Trump dead.
[00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:51.185]  We know that Graham is one of the key people in the deep state, and Trump should not be trusting him, and we should be investigating Lindsey Graham.
[00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:54.768]  But just understand, when you look at this reported shooter,
[00:09:55.805 --> 00:10:05.149]  And you look at the fact that he was a foreign fighter and organizing as a leader, bringing Americans over there to be part of the conflict.
[00:10:05.849 --> 00:10:07.010]  That's CIA all the way.
[00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.771]  The CIA admittedly is running the entire operation over there.
[00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:17.715]  And this guy who's probably didn't have any money was flying back and forth with $7,000 business class and first class tickets everywhere.
[00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:22.917]  And back in 2002, he got busted with a weapon of mass destruction, but just got a misdemeanor.
[00:10:22.937 --> 00:10:24.958]  Then all this other long rap sheet,
[00:10:26.087 --> 00:10:30.634]  For other firearms crimes and things, but he never actually does any jail time.
[00:10:31.034 --> 00:10:37.023]  This guy, like Lee Harvey Oswald and so many others, has a classic cutout of an intelligence agency operative.
[00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:40.979]  We've been doing some big reports on this and laying it out.
[00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:56.469]  It takes 20 minutes to even break down the surface of it, but his entire exit account was linking back to the deputy director of the CIA and to CIA recruitment groups, and the first person that he followed is a CIA operative that recruits people in these organizations.
[00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:02.694]  He was trying to recruit and was successful reportedly, but then the Ukrainians said no, getting Afghans to come fight
[00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:06.676]  They're in Ukraine a year and a half ago.
[00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:09.137]  So this all needs to be looked into.
[00:11:09.177 --> 00:11:12.138]  But Lindsey Graham, I like you, Trump.
[00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:13.199]  I'm your buddy.
[00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:23.664]  But they sure didn't look too happy in all those videos we saw from the RNC in Milwaukee, where him and Rupert Murdoch, another neocon, are sitting up there at the top the whole time.
[00:11:24.044 --> 00:11:28.426]  They kept cutting back the camera, just shaking their heads at Hulk Hogan and shaking their heads at Trump.
[00:11:29.844 --> 00:11:36.110]  The Deep State gets together in big conferences, and they made the decision to bare minimum stand down in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:43.957]  And this individual they've arrested, with the gun and the rest of it, that they recovered from a scene,
[00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:53.473]  He will probably be Epstein'd while he's in custody, but he reportedly was in federal court today arrogantly laughing, thinks it's really, really funny.
[00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:57.056]  He was on video when he got arrested, laughing and joking about it all.
[00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.900]  I mean, these are the whack jobs we're dealing with who want nuclear war.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.365]  Remember, just a year and a half ago, Sean Pinkham out said, we shouldn't shy away from nuclear war with Russia.
[00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:07.886]  We had one on the table.
[00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:30.493]  I mean, this is craziness.
[00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:33.374]  And all Ukraine is is a giant money laundering operation.
[00:12:33.414 --> 00:12:38.056]  And last Friday, Biden said, yeah, we're giving the green light to start bombing, NATO to start bombing.
[00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:38.877]  That means the U.S.
[00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:42.518]  start bombing Russia with high-powered precision giant cruise missiles.
[00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.419]  And Russia said that that'll be an act of war.
[00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:56.405]  So I said when it first broke that Trump had faced another assassination attempt, that I bet it's tied to Russia because they need to get rid of Trump as a specter of ending this war, as he's promised to do.
[00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.987]  Before they can launch the major escalation with Russia.
[00:13:00.007 --> 00:13:04.733]  And you have the EU leaders saying, we'll have a 20-30 year war.
[00:13:04.813 --> 00:13:06.456]  It'll be our new economy.
[00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:10.018]  And we'll use it to crack down on our political enemies domestically.
[00:13:10.598 --> 00:13:12.300]  So this is a real tyranny.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:25.753]  And when corrupt dynasties and empires get in trouble, they always, basically always, try to start a war to domestically get control of populations that are rebelling and not going along with what the system wants.
[00:13:26.293 --> 00:13:29.817]  A great film that's a historical film called The King,
[00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:56.752]  It was made about 10 years ago, or 8 years ago, is the story about 600 years ago of the British king, who's got all these uprisings in England by the Scots and by the Irish off their coast, and by the Welsh to what's Brittany's north, was to have a war with his cousin, the king of France.
[00:13:57.694 --> 00:14:04.537]  And of course, at the end of the movie, which is a true story, he learns that his first minister had staged the war to get political control that killed a bunch of his friends.
[00:14:04.557 --> 00:14:07.459]  So he kills the first minister, which is a true story.
[00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:10.300]  That was a king that was naive because he was young.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.082]  So this is the type of stuff that's going on, but they're not arranging a war with Russia.
[00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:24.467]  They're arranging the war between the US, Europe against Russia and bragging that it's their new financial plan to keep the dollar blocked up.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.305]  That's their new financial plan to prop up the dollar into the future, but it's not working.
[00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:33.108]  It's accelerating everyone to the bricks away from the dollar.
[00:14:33.148 --> 00:14:37.893]  So Lindsey Graham, out of all the suspects, is really the agent in place.
[00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:44.339]  The one you can't trust, the one with the horrible background, the one that is really running much of the CIA operations there and getting them the funding.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:58.286]  And to see an American who's been sheep-dipped and trained over there come back out of the clear blue sky and insert himself and almost kill the president for a second time is extremely, extremely worrisome and suspect.
[00:14:58.306 --> 00:14:59.787]  So, I'm saying it right here.
[00:14:59.887 --> 00:15:02.308]  Lindsey Graham, in my view, you need to be investigated.
[00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.709]  I think you're a suspect.
[00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:06.470]  The FBI admits they're looking for accomplices, people that helped him.
[00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.571]  They believe that's probably what happened.
[00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:09.231]  I think that evidence is overwhelming.
[00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:14.294]  The question is, you have the motive, you have the background, you have the history, and you knew Trump was going to be playing golf.
[00:15:14.574 --> 00:15:16.255]  So, Lindsey Graham, we're watching you.
[00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:21.336]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[00:15:21.396 --> 00:15:22.236]  Maybe there will be.
[00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:24.857]  People need to start taking to the streets.
[00:15:24.937 --> 00:15:26.498]  This is a dictator.
[00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:30.379]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives.
[00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:32.240]  Enemies of the state.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.221]  Show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:41.971]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless... When they go low, we kick them.
[00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:45.092]  How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?
[00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:52.135]  The biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right.
[00:15:52.315 --> 00:15:53.656]  I thought he should have punched him in the face.
[00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:55.736]  I said, even if you lost, he insulted your wife.
[00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:58.217]  He came down the escalator and called Mexicans rapists and murderers.
[00:15:58.237 --> 00:15:59.438]  He said, well, what do you think I should have done?
[00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.599]  I said, I think you should have punched him in the face and then gotten out of the race.
[00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:02.299]  You would have been a hero.
[00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.344]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[00:16:04.845 --> 00:16:07.708]  I said if we were in high school, I'd take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:10.611]  Punch some people in the face!
[00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:14.115]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:17.479]  They're still gonna have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a fact.
[00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:24.805]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:16:24.905 --> 00:16:31.153]  He is destructive to our democracy, and he has to be eliminated.
[00:16:31.213 --> 00:16:32.514]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:35.218]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:16:35.854 --> 00:16:38.696]  Look as his character is stabbed to death.
[00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:44.479]  Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:49.982]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:16:50.703 --> 00:16:58.147]  A Missouri State Senator is under investigation by the Secret Service after saying she hopes President Trump is assassinated.
[00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:01.069]  I will go and take Trump out tonight.
[00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:12.238]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:17:13.437 --> 00:17:16.419]  And you push back on them!
[00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.161]  And you tell them they're not welcome!
[00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:19.761]  Anymore!
[00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:19.981]  Anywhere!
[00:17:20.402 --> 00:17:29.728]  And sadly the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:17:29.928 --> 00:17:34.331]  They're not going to stop before election day in November and they're not going to stop after election day.
[00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:38.133]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:17:38.293 --> 00:17:40.835]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up and they should not.
[00:17:41.296 --> 00:17:44.426]  If you think we're rallying now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:09.153]  I got a great way for you to keep InfoWars on the air, and regardless what happens to InfoWars, keep me on the air, and that's TheAlexJonesStore.com, a new key URL for you to mark down.
[00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:12.937]  I've teamed up with the folks that make a lot of the top-selling Trump shirts in the country.
[00:18:12.977 --> 00:18:14.799]  They've got the best t-shirt designers, Bigley.
[00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:17.182]  If you go to TheAlexJonesStore.com,
[00:18:17.802 --> 00:18:18.903]  That's separate from InfoWars.
[00:18:18.943 --> 00:18:19.764]  That's key to support.
[00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:21.906]  Into the future, whatever happens here.
[00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:24.108]  30-plus amazing new t-shirt designs.
[00:18:24.368 --> 00:18:25.629]  New ones being added every day.
[00:18:25.989 --> 00:18:26.670]  They're incredible.
[00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.571]  Trump shirts.
[00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:28.271]  You name it.
[00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:30.413]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:37.139]  And every time you buy a shirt or 30-plus different great designs of Patriot ball caps, you get entered five or ten times, depending on the day.
[00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:37.900]  It's different every day.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.462]  Into the raffle to get $10,000 cash.
[00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:41.523]  Halloween's with them.
[00:18:41.883 --> 00:18:55.886]  Prizes announced, the winner, and a $138,000 turbo diesel, super deluxe, off-road upgraded, the best truck you can get, over-the-top, turbo diesel engine, AEV standard features, and then it's all upgraded.
[00:18:56.126 --> 00:18:57.386]  I tried to go over and take an hour.
[00:18:57.646 --> 00:19:00.187]  The best tires, the best shocks, the best systems.
[00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:05.408]  It's a 2024 Ram Prospector AEV Dodge turbo diesel.
[00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:08.090]  Army green, black, and red pinstripe.
[00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.231]  Ready for you.
[00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:13.834]  When you buy something, you can enter five or ten times, depending on what promo they're running that day, in the raffle.
[00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.736]  All at thealexjonestore.com.
[00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:18.118]  But the t-shirts, the reason to go there, keep us on air.
[00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.299]  And these are badass shirts.
[00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:21.841]  They've got over 30 incredible t-shirt designs.
[00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:22.561]  I think there's more now.

[00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:27.485]  They're designer.

[00:19:28.907 --> 00:19:29.647]  They're all there.
[00:19:29.887 --> 00:19:31.989]  Some of the M4's classics, they updated, made even better.
[00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.951]  A lot of new incredible designs.
[00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:36.104]  A lot of Alex Jones shirts.
[00:19:36.124 --> 00:19:37.825]  A lot of Trump shirts.
