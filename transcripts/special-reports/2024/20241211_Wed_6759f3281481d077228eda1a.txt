[00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:22.910]  Time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.250]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:32.369]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.320]  We're good to go.
[00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:30.329]  It is 7.50 Central Standard Time, Tuesday, December 24th, 2024. I have been on the air since 1994 in April.
[00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.590]  Coming up in just a few months, I've been on the air 31 years.
[00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.909]  I have been in these studios in South Austin for 16 years.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.239]  We have crew members that work here that have been here 23 years, like John Harmon and Wes and others.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.480]  Most of our crew members have been here at least 10 years, and they're the best crew I've ever had.
[00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:16.389]  Now, right now, in federal court, and federal law, as you notice, you never see federal trials, both civil or criminal, televised or audio, is not open to the public.
[00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.509]  You can go there and do sketches.
[00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.150]  You can go there and write notes.
[00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.469]  You get the transcript the next day.
[00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.090]  So we can't air it here, but I've been listening to it off and on all day, and so has the crew.
[00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.169]  And the federal judge, Christopher Lopez, Is set to rule tonight.
[00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.349]  He said he will rule tonight.
[00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:44.750]  We're supposed to have one day of an evidentiary hearing investigating the so-called sale to Michael Bloomberg.
[00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.830]  That's who owns and runs 97% of the funding for Everytown.
[00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.110]  That it came out in documents their own admissions.
[00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.550]  Is financing The Onion to try to take over InfoWars in these studios.
[00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.689]  And they said David Hogg wants to be involved.
[00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.780]  To misrepresent who we are and discredit the brand Infowars.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.680]  Total stalking.
[00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.000]  They have spent, as of two weeks ago in federal filings, the last seven years suing me, the Democratic Party.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.240]  This is what they filed, I don't know if it's true.
[00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.020]  $326 million.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.949]  That's the price tag they put on trying to silence us so they can then steal my identity and And misrepresented who I am.
[00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.110]  They're claiming if they're able to get this fraudulent sale, that they will own all of my back catalog, all of what we've covered on air.
[00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.009]  I've always said it's free to air, open to the public.
[00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.270]  Doesn't even belong to me.
[00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.330]  It's my free speech.
[00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.990]  Like if I published a book and said there's no copyright, anybody can republish.
[00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.189]  I couldn't later have bankruptcy and someone say they own the book because I gave it to the world free.
[00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.930]  That's all established.
[00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.789]  So we'll fight them.
[00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:47.409]  We'll beat that.
[00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.169]  They try to take over the X accounts.
[00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:50.229]  Elon must stop that.
[00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.629]  And ex-lawyers were in court this morning when all this started for day two.
[00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:11.009]  But the judge at about 4.30 said, okay, I'm going to hear cross-examination from the Alex Jones folks and that I'm going to rule.
[00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.949]  Some would take that like he'd already met up his mind.
[00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.189]  Maybe that they're full of crap and that the process was fraudulent or maybe he thinks it's okay now.
[00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.329]  I don't know.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.060]  But there's only between an hour to two hours, we're not exactly sure, left right now.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.540]  And then the judge said he will rule tonight.
[00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.240]  Now, generally, if they're on the fence, they might say, give me a couple days, give me a week.
[00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.860]  Sometimes they take months.
[00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.259]  He said, tonight.
[00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:54.759]  Now, if I tried to chronicle for you the Alice in Wonderland level bizarro land, That the DOJ U.S. trustee assigned by the DOJ to the case,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:10.949]  because they can come into cases, and the judge already fired, or got rid of the last U.S. trustee and the CRO, and then it rotated in this new one, When the last one on May 31st,
[00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:14.889]  six or seven months ago, tried to take over the building without a judge's order.
[00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.009]  And the judge said, what the hell are you doing?
[00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.790]  You're off the case, new U.S. trustee.
[00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.370]  And that guy said, I'm going to auction off the assets of InfoWars.
[00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:23.269]  Well, the bad guy said, we don't want money.
[00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.389]  We want it closed.
[00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.149]  Well, the law says he's got to have an auction.
[00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.389]  So he called it an auction, waited until two days before the auction on November 13th.
[00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.089]  And...
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.519]  Told the other real bidders that had gone in and filed all the paperwork and done everything properly and had a real cash bid.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.860]  They were told you have to have it on cash only.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.060]  Oh, new rules.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.939]  You'll have to put in a new bid by Wednesday morning, the 13th.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.139]  They told us on the 11th of November.
[00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.420]  And you will, then we'll just take the highest and best offer.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.699]  And then they took an offer for half the amount of money.
[00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.459]  That the group that I said I would work with, that did have the highest bid, put down.
[00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.920]  Then they said, well, we're the Sandy Hook families.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.600]  And by the way, it said in the rules, you can't have multiple bidder groups together.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.579]  That has to be disclosed.
[00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.060]  It wasn't.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.199]  They're going to pledge their future money from Alex Jones, which is on appeal, which you can't do under the law.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.000]  And by the way, the U.S. trustee and the auctioneer and all of them said in court the last two days, they said, we've never heard of this.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.079]  No, no one's ever done this.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:45.620]  But it's his business judgment that they told the other real better that had the highest bid, you can't use credit or derivatives or formulas.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.240]  But then they told the other group they could and kept that secret from them.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.279]  And then that went through.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:06.839]  Then it turned out, and they bid this to court today, the U.S. trustee did, Chris Murray, that they got their math wrong on their weird floating formula that no matter how much somebody else bid, they had put a floating bid up that would defeat it.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:19.040]  Pledging money out of the billion and a half dollars they claim I owe that $150 million last Friday got knocked off of by the appeals court, the lower appeals court in Connecticut.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.120]  Now it's going up higher.
[00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:27.990]  So that whole formula has already been knocked out, even if you believe the fiat voodoo economics garbage.
[00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:38.389]  So they're pledging money that by law they can't pledge for a loan or anything else that isn't money, that I don't even have the money to ever pay them this.
[00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.209]  I mean, I literally don't have $300,000 in the bank.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:54.040]  And they won hundreds of millions of dollars from their rigged court where the judges found me guilty and then had show trials, literally, for HBO cameras that produced it.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:03.100]  And so my lawyers and then the lawyers for the real winning bidder have just annihilated them.
[00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:12.629]  But they've taken about twice as much time as our lawyers, and they just mull over it and just, oh, it's quite normal, it's quite good, it's quite whatever.
[00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:22.589]  But then they use math and did the math wrong in this weird Bernie Madoff, I mean, it would make Bernie Madoff actually blush, I mean, literally, thing.
[00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:34.600]  And so three times since they said it was the winning bid, and twice since they filed in court more documents telling the judge, here's the winning bid, Changing it and moving it.
[00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:38.340]  And then today, I went home and saw my wife and youngest daughter.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.120]  The others are moved out.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.779]  Great folks.
[00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.399]  Went home and saw my wife and daughter.
[00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:43.600]  I always point that out because I got four kids.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.799]  Went home and saw my wife and daughter.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.240]  That implies I only got one child.
[00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:46.659]  I've got four.
[00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:47.120]  I love them all.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.340]  But the point is, I went home and saw my seven-year-old daughter and my wife.
[00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:50.019]  Had dinner.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.840]  And I'm sitting there listening to it while it's going on with an earbud.
[00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:56.960]  And I'm driving in about an hour and a half ago back to the office.
[00:08:58.139 --> 00:08:58.419]  And...
[00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:03.399]  I'm listening to Walter Sissack for the group that really won the auction.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.139]  There wasn't an auction.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.960]  He pointed that out.
[00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.379]  They were acting like there was an auction to follow the law, but they didn't have one.
[00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.440]  And he said, so what is the winning bid?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.580]  And Chris Murray said, I can't tell you.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.240]  It depends on how much money they get in the future.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.480]  Because they're going to pay more to themselves back...
[00:09:25.819 --> 00:09:27.879]  If they get more money from Alex Jones.
[00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:44.659]  And there's a weird deal with Bloomberg's group that is the investor and co-owner of The Onion, Everytown, that they're going to pay them part of the money out of that company To the Sandy Hook people.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.200]  Then they get up in Lion Court today and say, Mr. Jones attacked the Sandy Hook families again and pledged to always come after them for the rest of his life.
[00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:59.440]  No, I said Bloomberg and the lawyers and the Democrats, I'm suing them already.
[00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:06.830]  I'm coming after them because I'm sick of being stalked by them and them raising money off my name because they can't raise money for gun controls.
[00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:09.690]  They run these gun control ads and say, he's attacking us, help, send us money.
[00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:11.289]  I mean, I don't talk about them.
[00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:12.529]  They live off me.
[00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.309]  They're constantly attacking me, running ads, doing fundraisers.
[00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:22.889]  They have The Onion in every town, people, and all over TV, oh, he's attacking right now, help us, help us.
[00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:23.230]  What?
[00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.090]  They entered 22 minutes in evidence in Texas and Connecticut.
[00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.289]  It was all coordinated show trials of what I supposedly said about them.
[00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:32.629]  They had two videos of me with callers.
[00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.389]  Well, I don't think it happened.
[00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.350]  I said, yeah, I agree with you.
[00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.570]  Well, I can say the moon's made of cheese if I want.
[00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.730]  I think all sorts of stuff's fake, like Jussie Smollett, WMDs in Iraq.
[00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.230]  But nobody came to harass him.
[00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:44.610]  I sent nobody to harass him.
[00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.830]  I didn't pee on graves.
[00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:50.570]  And they would ask him in the show trials, my lawyers, well, who peed?
[00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.009]  I don't know.
[00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.610]  Well, who told you?
[00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.990]  Somebody.
[00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:52.649]  Who?
[00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:53.289]  I don't remember.
[00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:56.830]  So, somebody saw the Loch Ness Monster once, too.
[00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:06.149]  I had one debate on air between people that thought it happened and didn't happen, and covered it a couple times when the internet didn't believe it happened.
[00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.990]  Then they dredge it up when Trump wins, run national TV ads with Hillary against Trump saying, look, he's the Sandy Hook denier, and he's Trump's confidant.
[00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:25.299]  And then they did fundraisers for two years while saying I was attacking him, raising hundreds of millions reportedly for gun control in my name, using my face, saying he's attacking families of dead kids.
[00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:36.320]  And then they sue me, judges find me guilty, have show trials, claim I have hundreds of millions of dollars, I'm a criminal, it's all their money, I'm hiding it.
[00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.360]  None of that.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.179]  That all came out.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.139]  The courts audited me.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.100]  The IRS audited me.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:50.879]  They went back 12 years, found nothing because I am, you know, literally like Ward Cleaver or something when it comes to money and stuff.
[00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.759]  I mean, I have accountants that don't even touch it.
[00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:54.100]  Don't even mess with it.
[00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:55.659]  That's not even my goal.
[00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.629]  My goal is to defeat the New World Order.
[00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:04.710]  And so they got so pissed, the New York Times even admitted they showed it earlier, well, turns out Jones never really had that much money.
[00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:12.029]  Yeah, we had some years where we grossed like 60 million bucks, make 35% on water filters and stuff like that.
[00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:19.490]  That doesn't, anybody that, it's like saying a gas station sold $10 million of gas one year, then you learn the gas station makes 2% on gas.
[00:12:20.909 --> 00:12:23.350]  I mean, it's just, it's nuts.
[00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:25.809]  Lie upon, lie upon, lie upon lie.
[00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:39.789]  So, before this all got really bad and intense the last few years, when you're in a building 16 years, you like it, but you get sick of it.
[00:12:40.789 --> 00:12:43.529]  And you love your crew, but, you know, everybody gets a little tired of each other sometimes.
[00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:44.070]  It's stressful.
[00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.470]  It's real.
[00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:45.730]  Everybody loves each other, too.
[00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:48.350]  I was like, hey, I got a bunch of people want me to work for them.
[00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.389]  I can go to other networks.
[00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:58.590]  But when I saw them do all this to my crew and to myself and my family and how much they want Infowars and that idea of that, what a great name.
[00:12:58.649 --> 00:12:59.149]  That's what we're in.
[00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:00.809]  That's the term everybody uses now.
[00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.570]  They want to steal my identity.
[00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.490]  They admit that.
[00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.330]  They want to confuse people about who I really am.
[00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:07.490]  That's what they've been doing for years.
[00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.850]  Censoring me and then lying about me and saying I did things I didn't do to hurt the people, to hurt the liberty movement.
[00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:18.629]  And so I fought them.
[00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.250]  And I fought them.
[00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:22.149]  And now we're starting to have major victories.
[00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.169]  And they've got a lot of problems.
[00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.870]  And they were in a conspiracy to violate my rights.
[00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:37.610]  And so that's why I'm not a normal show where, oh, well, a normal show just needs X to run it.
[00:13:37.909 --> 00:13:38.870]  We have reporters.
[00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:39.549]  We have writers.
[00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.230]  We have crew.
[00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.309]  We want to expand back to where we were.
[00:13:42.429 --> 00:13:43.110]  They were scared of that.
[00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:44.250]  We want to go 24 hours a day.
[00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:47.029]  We certainly will after this with new owners and new people.
[00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.730]  Now they've really pissed me off.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:57.820]  And it's when you support our sponsors, who they've always harassed, we started direct selling decades ago, and everybody's copying us now, which is great.
[00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.679]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:10.000]  When you buy the supplements, when you buy the Patriot gear, when you do that at the AlexJonesStore.com, you are financing your own resistance to tyranny.
[00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:11.100]  I am your Paul Revere.
[00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:12.240]  My crew is your Paul Revere.
[00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:16.200]  We're reaching conservatively 50, 60, 70 million people a day.
[00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:17.220]  Some days a lot more.
[00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:24.360]  And Tom Homan listens to us, and Trump listens to us, and foreign leaders listen to us, and it comes out they do.
[00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:27.919]  I mean, people know that we know what we're talking about.
[00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:33.820]  So, it's backfired on them.
[00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.940]  Massive Streisand effect.
[00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.570]  And I just want to salute and support all the listeners and viewers for what you've done supporting us.
[00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:46.070]  We're all in this together.
[00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:57.309]  And I just want to thank the crew for how badass they've been through all of this incredible stress and this war.
[00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:00.730]  And I couldn't have done it without them, and I couldn't have done it without you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:03.610]  You truly are the men and women in the arena.
[00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.539]  So this is history.
[00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:10.779]  We're taking on the globalist death cult, the pedophile cult, literally.
[00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:13.360]  We're taking on the Jeffrey Epstein controllers.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.179]  We're taking on the people that think you're dumb slaves and I'm a dumb slave.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.379]  We're taking on people who think they're better than us and think that we don't even have a right to live.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.879]  That's why I played that.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.259]  I thought we had a censored version of all the cussing, but try to find that one, guys.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.980]  I want to play that again.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.500]  But, you know, I mean, that's what the spirit of the left is.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.799]  Very nihilistic, very selfish, very satanic.
[00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:36.830]  And it's the establishment.
[00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.649]  It's the globalists.
[00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:38.889]  It's the big banks.
[00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:45.590]  They want dumbed down, controlled, poor people they can rule over because that makes them feel good.
[00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:52.850]  So, I've left it all in the field.
[00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:56.009]  And I've been right where I want to be.
[00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.210]  And I'm lucky to see even be alive.
[00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:58.149]  They've tried to put me in prison.
[00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.950]  They put Owen in prison.
[00:15:59.029 --> 00:15:59.950]  You've seen the stuff they've done.
[00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.850]  They've had all these grand juries open on me.
[00:16:01.909 --> 00:16:03.330]  And by the grace of God...
[00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:07.139]  They weren't totally corrupt and literally said, well, we couldn't find anything.
[00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:09.820]  And I mean, I never made a big deal about it.
[00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:12.320]  When you get subpoenaed, you got to hire lawyers.
[00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:18.980]  I mean, you know, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, six-month, eight-month, year-long investigations.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.539]  Five times.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.480]  And those are the ones I know about.
[00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:26.279]  Like, the J6 committee is one that's public.
[00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:29.539]  And...
[00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.490]  They've tried to put me in prison.
[00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.370]  They've tried to shut us down.
[00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:44.690]  And they just think in the establishment, the lawyers and the bureaucrats, well, just side against Alex Jones and the establishment will, you know, get your head in life.
[00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.309]  The establishment's going down.
[00:16:47.929 --> 00:16:53.929]  There's been a major political realignment, not this year, but worldwide, and the lawfare and the corruption of the bureaucracy is one of the main reasons.
[00:16:55.429 --> 00:16:57.710]  So yeah, it's tough for those of us on the front lines.
[00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.330]  It's hard for those of us at the tip of the spear.
[00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.629]  But we asked for this.
[00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.370]  We did this.
[00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:04.069]  And we've had incredible success thanks to your support.
[00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.890]  So when you support us, you're standing on the front lines with us.
[00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.170]  As Trump said a thousand times, they're not trying to get him.
[00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.890]  He's standing in the way.
[00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.170]  They've got to get through him to get to you.
[00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.430]  It's the same thing for me.
[00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:15.690]  So...
[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:27.789]  Quite frankly, I've been doing this over 30 years, and it got really hairy in the last 25, and there's been a lot of stuff I never even told you about because I'm going to stay up on focus and mission.
[00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:36.589]  I don't want the broadcast to be about how they're attacking me all day because that's part of the reason they do it is to divert you off from covering the big subjects that I'm about to hit that affect everybody.
[00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:45.670]  But we've changed the world together, and I would have given my life for the success we've had against tyranny.
[00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:56.349]  Because it's my guts, it's my soul, it's my spirit, it's my mind, it's my will, it's my heart, it's my very sinew and my bones.
[00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.809]  Feel good when I fight evil.
[00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.109]  Feel good when I'm honorable.
[00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.730]  Feel good when I have courage.
[00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.569]  I feel strong.
[00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.430]  And my mind works better.
[00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.609]  And I'm so alive because of it.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.819]  And I know you are as well.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.619]  Whether you're old or young, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:17.559]  You love God.
[00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:18.279]  You love justice.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.480]  We are all unified by the fact we were made by the same creator.
[00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:23.759]  We have red blood and we think alike.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.460]  And our enemies think alike.
[00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:26.019]  They're a cult.
[00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.240]  Well, we're the cult of God.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.099]  We're the cult of freedom.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:29.880]  We're the cult of America.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.519]  We're the cult of 1776. We're the cult of honor and strength and will.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.880]  Because everything's a club.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.619]  Everything's a group.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.160]  Everything's what you choose to be.
[00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:39.119]  What organization you're part of.
[00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:42.400]  Well, I'm in Jesus' cult.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.819]  I'm in George Washington's cult.
[00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:54.240]  And these other people are in their sick, degenerate, anti-human, predatory death cult.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.220]  And they've declared war on us, and we have accepted the challenge.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:05.599]  And like I've said many times for decades, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.119]  And that's what we've given them.
[00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:12.160]  And so they want to score their fake victories and laugh and joke and do all this.
[00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:27.140]  If I was Machiavellian, which I can be, I can look into those systems, their attempts to take us off the air here, if successful, will only make the broadcast bigger.
[00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:30.359]  But you see, I don't think like a Machiavelli.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.380]  I think it's the right thing to save him full wars, to not let them fire the crew.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:46.440]  And to fight for every outpost and every inch of ground we've got, and then they force us into something else, sure, it'll even be bigger, but the point was we didn't engage in a false flag.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:52.980]  We didn't go at 90% against the enemy because, oh, we thought like they did and thought, well, you know, no, no, no.
[00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.309]  Now, Infowars is an important symbol.
[00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.309]  People want this victory.
[00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.990]  They want the judge to do the right thing.
[00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:17.690]  And to say the most ridiculous thing that's never been done in an auction, never been done in a federal bankruptcy case, both the U.S. trustee and the head auctioneer that's been doing it 40 years with a big company, so they've never seen it before, but it's their decision to give imaginary fiat money in a fake auction where you can't bid up.
[00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:20.309]  The judge said, well, actually...
[00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:24.970]  You could have gotten more money with the bid put in by the other group, but they actually had to hire one.
[00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.230]  He asked them those questions about two hours ago.
[00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:36.150]  And he said back on the 14th of this last month, on November 14th, that emergency hearing the day after the fake auction, that we called and he had.
[00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.170]  He said nobody should be comfortable with the results of this auction.
[00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:42.049]  And he said the auction didn't happen.
[00:20:42.349 --> 00:20:43.869]  Now, the media didn't pick that up.
[00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.930]  It was like, will the union keep its ownership?
[00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.769]  Then he said two Mondays ago, it didn't happen.
[00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.490]  Stop saying it.
[00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.289]  My lawyers are like, well, should we have a TRO to make Global Tetrahedron, the Onion Group?
[00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:57.009]  The Bloomberg Group stopped saying it.
[00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.769]  He said, well, they're smart.
[00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.710]  They know to quit.
[00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.089]  Well, they didn't quit.
[00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:05.569]  You go to their Global Tetrahedron New World Order site, and it's all fun and games.
[00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.269]  And they're betting that the judge will defend the system.
[00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:22.039]  They're betting that the judge will not want to embarrass the U.S. trustee and the Justice Department guy and will just sweep this under the rug.
[00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.900]  And I don't know what Chris Lopez is going to do.
[00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:26.380]  He was appointed by Trump.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.759]  He is a by-the-book guy, but nobody's had a case like this ever.
[00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:33.559]  He's even said that.
[00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:40.269]  And he hadn't done us any favors when they got up with the Connecticut lawyers and lied and said, you know, we've got a perfected judgment.
[00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.609]  Give him non-dischargeability.
[00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.130]  He said, fine, I'll follow your state law.
[00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:45.950]  My lawyers later showed him, hey, that's not what their law says.
[00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:46.509]  It's still an appeal.
[00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:47.150]  You can't do that.
[00:21:47.329 --> 00:21:49.410]  He said, well, I'll let the appeals courts handle that.
[00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.930]  So he's not done me any favors.
[00:21:53.109 --> 00:21:54.549]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.230]  We win no matter what.
[00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:57.309]  And I don't just say that.
[00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:02.569]  When we're losing, when things are going bad, I've been on the air 30 years, people knew, I would tell you, my view.
[00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:05.019]  No.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:15.640]  As long as we're 110% and tell the truth and are honorable and don't stop and keep exposing the tyranny, no matter what happens, it's in God's hands.
[00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:17.440]  So I've done what I'm supposed to do.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.960]  The crew's done what they're supposed to do.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.240]  You've done what you're supposed to do, praying for us, sharing the articles, boosting the information, being the key Paul Revere amplifiers.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:31.480]  And some of you have supported us at the AlexJonesStore.com and our other great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:35.940]  And I thank you.
[00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:37.339]  Plus they're great products.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.259]  But I am maxed out with the lawyers.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.420]  I've countersued them.
[00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:42.200]  I'm blocking them.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.200]  They're going to try to claim they own anything I ever said or did to take it off the internet.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.039]  That's ridiculous.
[00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:50.839]  I'm on record that it's free speech and that's a form of censorship.
[00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.400]  And they're not even trying to monetize it.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.779]  I'm countersuing them.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.059]  I will win this fight, but I can't do it without you.
[00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:59.160]  And I'm asking you to keep me in the fight for you.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.140]  Because I am here defending you.
[00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.029]  Because I understand that you've got children, I've got children.
[00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:05.509]  We have the same world we share.
[00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.230]  That's what empathy is.
[00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.730]  I am you.
[00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.589]  You are me.
[00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.130]  Literally.
[00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:12.910]  We are together in this fight.
[00:23:13.069 --> 00:23:14.369]  And we are turning the tide.
[00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:15.509]  We have the initiative.
[00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.490]  We are winning.
[00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.910]  I told you Trump would win in a landslide.
[00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.710]  They'd try to steal it.
[00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.869]  It would look like a small landslide.
[00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.450]  I nailed it.
[00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.470]  We announced that Trump won that night, the first.
[00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:30.769]  God told me, show him.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.279]  And if I get told to do it, I'll do it right now.
[00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:39.519]  But only, it's like a, it's not a like it, it's like a thing that happens.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.000]  And I said Trump will come out and announce he's won at 127. He'll come on the stage.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.400]  Before the minute ends, he will say thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.799]  Happened exactly as I said.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.480]  I didn't call the time zone.
[00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:49.279]  I wasn't thinking of that.
[00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:50.759]  I was live on air.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.380]  And people say, well, that sounds crazy.
[00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:53.000]  Well, I did it.
[00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:56.539]  It's not like I've done it 10 or 15 times and hit it one time.
[00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:58.240]  I've done it other times here for you folks.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.799]  And that's God.
[00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:04.599]  I'm just a vessel or a transceiver, an antenna.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.339]  And that's why I want to be good and be courageous.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.579]  God hates cowards.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.440]  I want to get in alignment with God, and Lord knows I'm a sinner.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.480]  But I want to be good, and I want to be in the quiet place, the most high that King David talked about, and I've been there many times with God's presence.
[00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:22.440]  I can feel it now.
[00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:26.500]  And so, whatever happens tonight...
[00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:31.980]  It's been one hell of a fight and one hell of a journey so far.
[00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:39.859]  And this is just another milestone in the epic struggle for freedom and free speech and freedom of the press.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.640]  Because the enemy can't win if there's a free press.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.980]  They can't win if you have free speech.
[00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:45.740]  They can't win if you exercise that free speech.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.319]  They try to tell you you can't say Merry Christmas.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.359]  You can't say Mother and Father.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.319]  They want to take down statues of the founding fathers.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:53.740]  They are.
[00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:55.259]  Thomas Jefferson, you name it.
[00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:57.579]  These people hate you.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.359]  These people want to take your culture and replace it with something a thousand times worse.
[00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:02.700]  Because our culture isn't perfect.
[00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:05.160]  America was the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:11.059]  But what they want to replace it with is pure New World Order death cult garbage.
[00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:21.259]  So, I'm not, in the last 30 minutes I've been on air, gone and listened to the new developments.
[00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:24.759]  And they're getting up close to the closing arguments right now.
[00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:29.750]  And so I don't know if it's gonna, the judge, he said he'll rule right after.
[00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.390]  Which could mean he's already decided we're right or he's already decided they're right.
[00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.869]  Because when they generally say that, it means they've already made up their mind.
[00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:40.950]  He said that about three hours ago when I was driving back into work.
[00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:43.289]  Back to the war.
[00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:47.430]  Back to this incredible thing we've done together.
[00:25:47.789 --> 00:26:04.170]  And it took total dedication, myself and the crew, and it took dedication by you And like I said, if I got the money to fight these people and somebody just wrote me a check to one of these billionaires,
[00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:07.690]  you never hear an ad on this show.
[00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:20.089]  But instead, I've tried to bring in the very best products and the very best stuff that you'll want and like and get again and again and again so that I'll have the money to fight and take on the entire New World Order system.
[00:26:21.569 --> 00:26:24.569]  $326 million they've filed in court two weeks ago to shut us down.
[00:26:25.569 --> 00:26:26.609]  That's a badge of honor.
[00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:31.269]  And yeah, you had to buy a lot of supplements and a lot of t-shirts and a lot of water filters.
[00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:33.589]  But didn't they make you healthy?
[00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.509]  Weren't they better?
[00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.569]  So like I said, I hate sounding like the home shopping network.
[00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.089]  But you know what?
[00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.970]  If that's what it takes to win a revolution against a satanic death cult, I'll do it.
[00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:50.210]  Hell, most revolutions, I mean, our founding fathers...
[00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.849]  This is a war.
[00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:55.609]  It's not robbing.
[00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:04.089]  You know, British ships and British coaches, stagecoaches, you know, full of gold and shot the people.
[00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:07.950]  George Washington just signed death warrants all day long.
[00:27:08.089 --> 00:27:09.990]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.890]  Kill this person.
[00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.529]  Kill that person.
[00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:13.690]  See, I got an easy job.
[00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:14.349]  I don't know how to do that.
[00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.329]  It's an information war.
[00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.950]  Globalists tell you, warfare is 90 plus percent information now.
[00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.609]  I kind of know about that.
[00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:24.039]  That's why I named it InfoWars in 1997. Website, they say $19.99 on Wikipedia.
[00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:24.680]  That's not true.
[00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:39.720]  And I've just got to sell you turmeric and Ultimate Seamoss and great t-shirts and we don't have to blow anybody's head off, do we?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.839]  So, you know what?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.660]  I don't apologize.
[00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:43.880]  Even though I'm annoyed by it.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.180]  So...
[00:27:48.549 --> 00:28:00.769]  If I had to beat people over the head for three hours out of a four-hour show, which instead we beat you over the head about 10 minutes with live plugging every day, then the ads are just there for stations because that's network systems they want.
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:08.049]  I would do it because then in that 10 minutes I can tell you the enemy plan and people will then cut that out and get that out and wake up the world.
[00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.390]  But I've got to have the infrastructure for this operation.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.900]  And for every, I don't know, I've spent like almost $17 million now.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.140]  My dad hit $2 million.
[00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.200]  They've been suing him for no reason.
[00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:20.339]  He's been proven totally innocent, all the fake stuff they claimed.
[00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:30.579]  What is $18-19 million divided into $326 million?
[00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:32.680]  Guys, do that on calculator for me.
[00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:38.880]  How much more money have they spent for every one of our dollars to try to silence us?
[00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:46.369]  And it came out of the State Department, the CIA, the FBI, all come out in the news saying, get that guy off the air.
[00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.869]  Shut him up.
[00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.470]  Well, you saw what I covered today, or maybe you missed it.
[00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:54.349]  I mean, do you know what we covered?
[00:28:57.289 --> 00:29:02.009]  That all these top generals and top national security advisors and intelligence heads...
[00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:06.750]  In the West, it meant we are now in World War III. Told you that three weeks ago.
[00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.009]  I said, soon they'll announce it.
[00:29:08.089 --> 00:29:11.849]  Because I study war, I study threat doctrine, threat escalation ladders.
[00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:19.670]  I mean, I guarantee I've studied most, you know, of people in major administration positions.
[00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.009]  Because most of these people just mail it in.
[00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.109]  Okay?
[00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.410]  And the point is, I know what I'm talking about on these copy issues.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:39.059]  And now that's all escalated with all these overthrows of coups in Romania and overthrows in Syria and civil wars in Georgia and bombing Russia with missiles, on and on and on.
[00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:45.359]  And then I told you, soon they'll activate Black Lives Matter and start calling for riots ahead of Trump getting in, and now that's happening.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.640]  Because the Democrats said they're going to try to have a race war as the cover for their martial law.
[00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.099]  And now that's going on.
[00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:54.019]  And I told you they're going to try to roll out viruses again.
[00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:59.240]  Now they say, we're rolling out viruses and this will take control of Trump and cave in his administration.
[00:29:59.819 --> 00:30:01.500]  I mean, it's not hard.
[00:30:02.019 --> 00:30:03.119]  New pandemic.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.579]  Race war is the cover for civil unrest, civil emergency, drive Trump from office.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.400]  World War III to hold a nuclear weapon gun to everybody's heads.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.119]  And then I told you all these so-called UFOs are just government drones swarming and scaring everybody.
[00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:21.799]  And now in New York, New Jersey, everywhere.
[00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:23.160]  Oh, civil emergency.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.079]  We need the government.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.339]  We need the military out on the streets.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.000]  We're being attacked by aliens.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.059]  That's in the news today.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.440]  We need a state of emergency.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.000]  It's the government.
[00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:37.099]  You can see there are groups of drones flying together to look like a big spaceship.
[00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:48.849]  I mean, you know, and I told you three days ago, I told you a week, nine days ago, when the whole thing in Syria started, I said, Israel, Turkey, and NATO are behind it.
[00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.250]  Turkey will take the north of Syria.
[00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:54.430]  Israel will take the south.
[00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:00.710]  Then they'll start acting like they're fighting with each other so that people won't know they're in collusion.
[00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.190]  And Netanyahu said, oh yeah, we're invading on Saturday.
[00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.829]  And now he says, we're keeping it.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.319]  I mean, I told you that the first day it started nine days ago.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.140]  People were like, don't be too hasty, Alex.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.920]  You don't know that.
[00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:12.880]  The hell I don't.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.259]  I can go look at the names of the groups.
[00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:21.799]  That damn Al-Qaeda group they call the Syrian Democratic Resistance is Al-Qaeda on record.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.079]  Even CNN. Sunday night was like, well, he is the former leader of Al-Qaeda, but he's a good guy now.
[00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:30.019]  Played it a bunch on Monday's show.
[00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:31.220]  Guys, find it in yesterday's list.
[00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:33.099]  It's clip number one from yesterday.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.380]  So, it wasn't my opinion when I said all that nine days ago.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:50.180]  The first day it started, I was at the gym on Friday morning nine days ago at 7 a.m.
[00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:57.180]  And there's a bunch of former military guys that are, you know, professionals and like in IT and stuff.
[00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.700]  They walk around, what's going on in Syria?
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.700]  I heard there's like big rebels going in and all this stuff.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.960]  And I went, I don't know, let me go, you know, look.
[00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:07.660]  So I'm working out.
[00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:08.880]  I kind of get on my, look, the name.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.779]  Oh, gosh, that's Al-Qaeda.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.420]  Well, that means Israel and the United States.
[00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:14.400]  That's who runs that.
[00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:15.900]  And I went and looked to Turkey.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.500]  He was involved.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.180]  I went, well, yeah.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.240]  So...
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:25.279]  About an hour and 20 minutes later, I'm in the sauna, and that guy comes in, one of them, and he goes, so what do you think now?
[00:32:25.359 --> 00:32:29.440]  And I said, oh, it's Israel and Turkey and NATO. He goes, how do you know?
[00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:30.079]  And I got my phone.
[00:32:30.079 --> 00:32:31.779]  I was in the sauna, and I go, see right there?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.859]  That's the al-Qaeda leader.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.539]  Here's articles.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.460]  I started showing him.
[00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.640]  Here's articles years ago that he works for Israel and the United States.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.279]  I said, wow.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:45.980]  I was like, yeah, like, you know, like, I mean, you know the U.S. government gave $87 million in weapons.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:33:02.940]  Two and a half, three years ago in Afghanistan so that they can then use those weapons to invade Syria, which, by the way, I said at the time, watch,
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.980]  they're going to use this against Syria first than others.
[00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.740]  I mean, this is not hard.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.200]  I don't know why people don't see the puzzle pieces or the risk board here.
[00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.470]  And then they're going to let the jihadis attack us here, and then they'll take our rights away that way.
[00:33:17.769 --> 00:33:18.849]  Because there'll be no logic.
[00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:27.430]  You open the borders up, bring them in, let them attack us, and then the same government that did all that takes more of our rights and grabs our balls at the airport while the border's wide open.
[00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:29.950]  I mean, is that rocket science?
[00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:35.069]  See, they don't like me because most men I know are smart.
[00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.750]  They just focus on the wrong thing.
[00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:43.019]  Most men I know Know everything about golf or everything about their cars or everything about football or basketball or baseball.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:49.319]  And they know all about their favorite players and they remember plays they did 25 years ago.
[00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:50.000]  And I love Owen.
[00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:50.680]  He's a great guy.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980]  Former sportscaster.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.279]  And I'm not knocking him for liking sports.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:53.940]  He deserves it.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.640]  He fights tyranny all the time.
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.960]  He deserves some fun stuff.
[00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:59.220]  It's the people that don't do any fighting tyranny.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.940]  But he's got a famous baseball player on, Rocker, who I even know.
[00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:05.299]  I mean, I followed it a little bit back then.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.000]  Great guy.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:06.400]  Funny.
[00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:07.000]  Patriot.
[00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.760]  And Owen remembered stuff when he was like 10 years old, what this guy was doing.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.119]  The exact plays, how fast he threw the ball.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.099]  The guy's like, yeah, I throw it 97. That was the one.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.659]  But see, Owen uses that memory for politics, too.
[00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:26.699]  So see, I know that guy's the leader of Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.599]  That's not hard.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:38.579]  I mean, you guys can remember what a baseball player 20 years ago when you were 10 years old threw on a certain game in a certain inning and how the bases were loaded?
[00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:46.059]  And then I know there's HIV nanotech in all the new vaccines.
[00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.800]  It's in the documents.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.699]  I read the studies.
[00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.039]  It's on record.
[00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:50.960]  They don't deny it.
[00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:58.849]  So, you guys can know how fast somebody threw a fastball on a given day, 20-something years ago.
[00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.309]  I don't give a damn about that.
[00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:10.110]  Now, if we weren't in total tyranny and about to lose everything in World War III, I used to go to baseball games.
[00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.190]  I used to go to football games.
[00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.090]  I played football.
[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.369]  I used to play baseball until nighttime when I was a kid.
[00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.309]  But I have to choose my priorities.
[00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:29.809]  My mental space, my brain space is for what's actually happening.
[00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:34.510]  Like 325,000 missing kids the government released and disappeared their records.
[00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.050]  The Border Patrol estimates the last four years it's over 1,200,000.
[00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.210]  They found a bunch of them dead and in sex slavery and slave labor.
[00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:50.670]  See, how obscene is it See, what is sports?
[00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.769]  It's simulated combat.
[00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:53.789]  That's why it's so popular.
[00:35:53.929 --> 00:35:54.710]  We're designed to do that.
[00:35:55.869 --> 00:36:00.510]  And see, in real war, it's all about numbers and facts and supplies, and it's not just the physical fighting.
[00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.269]  So when you watch a football game, that's war.
[00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:04.289]  That's chess.
[00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.710]  Eleven men facing eleven men.
[00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:11.429]  And so your body gets it in their different uniforms, different armies.
[00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.909]  It's all, you're like, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.829]  And it feels good to know all the numbers and strategic.
[00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:20.130]  Because you're supposed to know that for business and your family and your kids and your lives.
[00:36:20.269 --> 00:36:28.809]  But instead, the public-private schools almost everywhere are secretly teaching your kids that they're in other sex or that pedophilia is good and getting them ready to have their balls cut off.
[00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.269]  You're supposed to be in control of the school.
[00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:33.150]  You control the money for now.
[00:36:34.929 --> 00:36:38.110]  But under the social credit score, if you get in their way, they'll take your money away.
[00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.829]  We're almost in the chains.
[00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.329]  So you're supposed to understand the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:47.849]  You're supposed to understand federalism.
[00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:50.050]  You're supposed to understand the separation of powers.
[00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.070]  You're supposed to understand how to skin a buck, run a trot line.
[00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.389]  You're supposed to understand how to rock a baby to sleep or how to change a diaper.
[00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.250]  You're supposed to know how to string electrical wire.
[00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:01.469]  You're supposed to know how to change a tire.
[00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:05.449]  You're supposed to know how to beat the living hell out of somebody that attacks your family.
[00:37:08.699 --> 00:37:39.449]  You're supposed to know how to bust your ass because it's fun and it's being a human and it's what you're supposed to do and you're supposed to know how to take on tyrants and you're supposed to know how when you feel the pain taking them on that means you're over the target so you lean into the pain and you say give me more pain and soon that pain turns to ecstasy because that's where you're supposed to be Humanity's
[00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:39.989]  amazing.
[00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:45.250]  When we got our heads screwed on straight, we're strong, strong, strong!
[00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.349]  So they declared war on me, they declared war on you.
[00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:52.809]  I have accepted the challenge.
[00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.510]  Have you accepted the challenge?
[00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.730]  Have you decided to roll over and die?
[00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:07.070]  Because you're in a spiritual coma.
[00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:10.940]  Or have you decided to stand up and do what's right?
[00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:16.420]  So, this is potentially...
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:23.219]  I don't think that judge had made up his mind.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.340]  I think he said that because they were taking so long to get them to hurry up.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.639]  But we'll see.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.559]  And there's no way in hell that judge can rule in favor of them unless he's sweeping the side of the rug.
[00:38:35.639 --> 00:38:36.179]  And I don't know.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.840]  You know who's on trial today?
[00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.829]  The legal process in this country.
[00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:45.570]  And you've seen the referendum with Trump against the lawfare.
[00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:53.710]  So no matter what the outcome here, we win because we continue to fight.
[00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.469]  And because we're in the right.
[00:38:57.269 --> 00:39:03.610]  And because the straw man lies they built, the identities they built to say Trump is this or Alex Jones is that.
[00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:06.070]  Or you're this or you're that.
[00:39:06.869 --> 00:39:08.050]  Well, that's not who we are.
[00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.829]  We don't accept who they say we are.
[00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:10.869]  We are who we are.
[00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:18.829]  We can hold our head high and know that we care about God and care about our families and care about our country and want a decent nation.
[00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.369]  And there are good people.
[00:39:21.449 --> 00:39:22.349]  And we are good.
[00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.650]  And they know it.
[00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:25.250]  And that's why they don't like us.
[00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:26.849]  Because we're not for sale.
[00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:36.489]  That's why they want their ESG system and their social credit score to squeeze us and take everything away we've got so they can slowly bend our will to submit to them and train us to be like their little dogs.
[00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.650]  But I'll never be their slave.
[00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:51.329]  Now, I want to bring Rob Dew in here.
[00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:56.170]  He's in his normal work attire.
[00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.869]  He's not in a sports taker thing.
[00:39:57.869 --> 00:39:59.269]  He goes, well, my suit's not here.
[00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:00.429]  I'm like, Rob, you don't need a suit.
[00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.829]  You can be wearing your athletic gear.
[00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:05.989]  Love Rob.
[00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.250]  He's been here 16 years.
[00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:09.070]  Good friend of mine.
[00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.809]  And he's been listening to the whole thing.
[00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.269]  And he's good at remembering all the stuff.
[00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:14.989]  It gives me a headache.
[00:40:16.029 --> 00:40:17.349]  I mean, it's so bad.
[00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.489]  It's such a con game that the judges have been there for two years.
[00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.369]  Can you explain this?
[00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.809]  Well, there's Q97349. And then my people do the numbers.
[00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:26.369]  This doesn't match.
[00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:27.170]  Well, we changed it.
[00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:28.909]  Oh, that was wrong, too.
[00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:29.550]  We changed it again.
[00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.389]  The judges are like, huh?
[00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:33.110]  They've changed their bid.
[00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:37.409]  The people supposedly won on November 13th.
[00:40:41.989 --> 00:40:43.130]  Three times since then.
[00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:46.420]  Last Friday they filed in court.
[00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:49.420]  Oh, our bid's actually $7 million, not $1.7 million.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.500]  And then they came in on Monday and filed and said, actually, it's $3.6 million.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.920]  But it's my discretion.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:17.409]  I'm Chris Murray with the DOJ. It reminds me This Chris Murray guy reminds me of Peter Strzok,
[00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:18.210]  but he's bald-headed.
[00:41:21.489 --> 00:41:31.630]  And, you know, I'm in this weird place with these people where I pity them because they're so disgusting and dishonorable, in my opinion.
[00:41:34.029 --> 00:41:35.909]  And, you know, this is them in the bidding process.
[00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.130]  This is how it works.
[00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:39.690]  I mean, but this is not even as crazy as a bidding process.
[00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:53.329]  Because, you know, they pour tea in one thing, and then pour it out of another, and then pour it in another, and then mix it, and then flip it in the air, and then break it, and then smash a clock on it, and then, and then, of course, they just want some tea, but never give it to them.
[00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:57.389]  And you just, literally, they get to go, explain it, explain it.
[00:41:57.449 --> 00:41:58.110]  Well, we can't.
[00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.809]  And the judge says, well, what is the winning bet?
[00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:00.730]  I can't tell you.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.699]  I mean, it is the weirdest crap.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.619]  And that's what they do.
[00:42:06.699 --> 00:42:09.800]  They come up with these things that are so bizarre, you can't figure it out.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.539]  If you can't understand something, it's a scam.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.420]  You know, there's an old saying, you can't con an honest man.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.280]  Because our brains just don't work like it.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:29.380]  I mean, I... That's why I told my people, they were trying to figure it out weeks ago, I said, none of it adds up, watch.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.059]  And they had to get mathematicians to figure it out, literally.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.860]  And they went in, because it's like, it's not normal math, because it's a fraud.
[00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:40.780]  And they kept, and they would go to them and say, this doesn't, this is less money.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.760]  You said, oh, we made a mistake, let us fix that again.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:49.000]  They didn't even get the numbers right in their formulas.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.099]  Of course, because it came out of the ass of Democrat Party lawyers.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:03.760]  Did you see earlier this week, in court, Hunter Biden had a $20,000 a month apartment.
[00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:08.710]  And it was more than that.
[00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.849]  It was like $300,000 for a year.
[00:43:10.969 --> 00:43:11.469]  You do the math.
[00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:13.530]  A $324,000 bill.
[00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.889]  Guys, pull it up.
[00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.650]  Type in, this is the art.
[00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:18.389]  It was on X. It was mainstream news.
[00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:19.710]  This is the art.
[00:43:19.809 --> 00:43:23.070]  When the guy said, you haven't paid me in a year, he said, here, here's a piece of my art.
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:30.489]  And it was a doodles on a notepad of insane stuff, a schizophrenic with right, and feces on it.
[00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.309]  They tested it.
[00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:33.289]  He goes, here, here is my feces.
[00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.550]  And they looked at it, it's poop.
[00:43:48.269 --> 00:43:51.449]  So, okay, Hunter Biden topped Chris Murray.
[00:43:52.389 --> 00:43:59.489]  But, I mean, I'm surprised they didn't say, look, the winning bid that Michael Bloomberg gave us is one of his turds.
[00:43:59.889 --> 00:44:08.230]  I'm surprised they didn't walk up with a bottle with a turd in it and say, Michael Bloomberg shit in this, and this is the most precious thing in the universe right here.
[00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:18.750]  So, yeah, these are crazy people.
[00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:20.849]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.369]  You hear about these women all getting pregnant.
[00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.809]  Women are getting each other pregnant in the California prisons, uh-huh.
[00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:29.730]  And what's next?
[00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:31.409]  The Lucky Charms elf's real?
[00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:36.730]  Or this is a leprechaun?
[00:44:39.769 --> 00:44:40.170]  So...
[00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:46.900]  I'm told it's getting real fireworks right now, but you can't air a federal court case.
[00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.360]  Lord knows, I can have a crooked toenail or I go to prison.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.000]  Democrats leaked federal courts.
[00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.280]  You hear it every day on the news.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.139]  That's okay, they're Democrats.
[00:45:00.719 --> 00:45:03.940]  So, I'm going to get an update from Dewey.
[00:45:04.019 --> 00:45:04.880]  He said, give me 10 more minutes.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.320]  It's really getting good.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.219]  I don't know what that means.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.760]  So, I'll tell you who's on trial again.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.059]  It's the judiciary.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.079]  It's the court system.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:33.630]  And I've never seen such an open and shut case of bid rigging, of price fixing, Of collusion, and I've got really good, well-respected lawyers,
[00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:47.050]  and the people that won the bid, that group has a really well-known lawyer, and they've all filed, and they've said, Your Honor, we've never seen fraud this bad, and we've never seen anything like this from a U.S. trustee.
[00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:51.989]  They said, we have to show you the U.S. code, and we have to file this.
[00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:52.869]  It's right here.
[00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:03.210]  So, I mean, let me just say this again.
[00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.730]  They said there's an open public auction, you know, where you can bid up.
[00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:07.769]  That's the definition of an auction.
[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.489]  Property sold to the highest bidder.
[00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:12.070]  Merriam-Webster.
[00:46:12.909 --> 00:46:13.530]  Pull it up.
[00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:22.230]  And Then two days before, they go, oh, it's now a new bid.
[00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.030]  It's going to be there by Wednesday at 10.30 or 10 a.m.
[00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.809]  And at 10.30, we open it, and whoever's the biggest wins.
[00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.489]  And remember, you can't have credit or derivatives or anything, just cash.
[00:46:32.869 --> 00:46:34.070]  And they give them those rules.
[00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.230]  Our people, who we're working with.
[00:46:36.869 --> 00:46:43.929]  And then they, on the other side, say, but you can use credit off of Alex Jones' future money, which is totally not the law.
[00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.949]  It isn't considered legal tender or cash.
[00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.670]  I said, wires only of cash.
[00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.050]  And we're like, okay, our folks, I'm working with them.
[00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.889]  But already, they're ready for a live auction to go up a lot.
[00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:58.400]  But no, they don't want to actually pay for something that goes to them.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.679]  They just want to capture and kill.
[00:47:00.239 --> 00:47:02.340]  Remember, because they pay for it, they get it back themselves.
[00:47:02.679 --> 00:47:05.380]  They didn't want to give money and then take it right back to themselves.
[00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.000]  Oh, here, we buy it.
[00:47:07.539 --> 00:47:08.719]  And then they get the proceeds.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.739]  You know, they now admit in court, it's the Sandy Hook parents, meaning Bloomberg Democratic Party, using them as their fronts.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.840]  And it says in the bid, whoever's on the name can't have any other partners that are secret.
[00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:20.480]  Well, they kept the Sandy Hook family secret until now, too, recently.
[00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.590]  They'll just violate, violate, violate, violate.
[00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.929]  But it's all at the DOJ trustee's discretion.
[00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:35.949]  The active process of bidding a sale of property to the highest bidder, the number one definition.
[00:47:36.369 --> 00:47:37.190]  Like I told you.
[00:47:37.329 --> 00:47:45.570]  So, they then give them different rules, the real highest bidder, and then give themselves other rules.
[00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:50.909]  And then the judge the next day at the emergency hearing on the 14th of November says, well, what is the highest bidder?
[00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.989]  And Murray says, I can't tell you.
[00:47:52.929 --> 00:47:58.210]  And today he said, I can't tell you, Your Honor, because we don't know if they'll ever get any of this money from Alex Jones.
[00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.329]  I don't have it anyways.
[00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.409]  And it's on appeal.
[00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:14.769]  So they pledged my future money that is still in question whether they get it or if I could ever even make it, which is impossible.
[00:48:14.769 --> 00:48:16.070]  I'll never make a billion dollars.
[00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:26.750]  To then pay them for buying my company.
[00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:28.789]  That give you a headache?
[00:48:33.969 --> 00:48:36.730]  But then anybody else bidding didn't get to know that.
[00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.670]  Tell you what, let's watch the Alice in Wonderland Tea Party scene.
[00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.510]  Find like a full version of it.
[00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.750]  I'm going to play that here today.
[00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:49.429]  This is a documentary.
[00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:57.369]  And then I want to get the idiocracy clip, the idiocracy court scene, trying to get the longer version, where he comes in.
[00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:04.570]  The more he defended himself with what was perceived as effeminate language, the more they hated him.
[00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.769]  Hot dogs like a fag!
[00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:16.769]  So, yeah, I want to play theocracy, and then I want to play Alice in Wonderland, because those would be better places.
[00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.269]  I mean, I'm not saying Judge Lopez is like that.
[00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.190]  I'm talking about the other side.
[00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:21.269]  They'll be in the court.
[00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:22.329]  You know, your honor!
[00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:24.489]  They just called you an idiot!
[00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.269]  No, he's very smart.
[00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:27.769]  Impressively so.
[00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.210]  Because I've watched and listened to him a lot.
[00:49:30.369 --> 00:49:35.349]  And so, I can't see how he doesn't rule in our favor, but it's the establishment.
[00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.309]  That's why I predicted last Friday.
[00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:40.809]  I said that Connecticut will rule against me in the appellate court.
[00:49:40.929 --> 00:49:42.510]  There's still the Supreme Court of the state and the federal.
[00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:46.130]  The Texas Supreme Court will throw it out for sure, but it doesn't matter.
[00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.630]  It's not the money.
[00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:59.210]  And so no matter how much money I ever do, it's never enough because I'm not Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.
[00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:02.269]  And that's what they wanted.
[00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:03.369]  They said we want him off the air permanently.
[00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.409]  That's why I wanted judgment so high.
[00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:05.750]  How about money?
[00:50:12.199 --> 00:50:14.980]  And starting World War III with Russia is idiocracy.
[00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:21.579]  Trying to dumb the public down so you can manage them better when it's all going to blow back on you is idiocracy.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.260]  Saying there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.380]  I mean, not just Bill Nye.
[00:50:25.519 --> 00:50:29.079]  I saw Niels de Grasse Tyson over the weekend.
[00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:29.559]  I meant to play.
[00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:30.480]  It was in the Sunday list.
[00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:35.460]  And he says, a woman of the same weight is just as good at sports as a man.
[00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:37.880]  That's completely not true.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.099]  Men are twice as strong on average muscularly, bones even more so.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.760]  That's a fact, a known fact.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.519]  So men can compete with women, because we call them women, because women are just as strong as men.
[00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:50.360]  That is horse crap on its face.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.539]  That's Alice in Wonderland Tea Party.
[00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.869]  Where the whole process is it's insane and makes no sense.
[00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.050]  And then they all laugh at you and gaslight you.
[00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:03.510]  While they're pouring it on their head.
[00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.849]  Have some tea.
[00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:05.590]  And it goes through.
[00:51:05.769 --> 00:51:07.409]  And they pour it and smash the glass.
[00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.130]  And you're like, this is crazy.
[00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:10.030]  And they go, yeah, that's the point.
[00:51:14.179 --> 00:51:16.760]  And they all get up on the court and go, Your Honor, it's quite fact.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:17.719]  I'll talk for two hours.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:27.380]  The Q973 of the overlay of the numbers 8713 of the derivative cross-section of the 1297314X5 cumular.
[00:51:27.659 --> 00:51:28.599]  Does that make sense?
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.079]  No.
[00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:31.719]  Well, okay, we did your math.
[00:51:32.019 --> 00:51:33.360]  Let's walk through that for an hour.
[00:51:34.519 --> 00:51:35.440]  It's way off.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.179]  I know, we fixed it.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.760]  Well, the next time you did it, it's wrong.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.599]  And these lawyers walk through with them...
[00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:44.179]  For days.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.019]  And it's all just complete insane.
[00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:50.079]  You ever had like a really high fever, 105 or something?
[00:51:50.139 --> 00:51:51.860]  You wake up, you're like hallucinating and nothing makes sense.
[00:51:52.019 --> 00:51:59.820]  And, you know, like you catch yourself kind of staring at a, you know, penny on the ground or something in your garage.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.000]  And you're like, I've been here for an hour.
[00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:02.780]  I've only been like that a few times.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.760]  You're like fever dream.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.400]  You're like, what?
[00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:07.940]  I mean, that's what watching these people are.
[00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:08.159]  What?
[00:52:09.699 --> 00:52:11.159]  And you're just like, these are crazy people.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.260]  And they want to make us conform to their lunatic asylum.
[00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:17.039]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:52:21.199 --> 00:52:28.260]  So, the entire Democrat Bloomberg party in these hearings has been just like the cityocracy clip.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.179]  The judge, not like that.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.599]  The reason I say that is you'll probably say the judge says he's the judge from idiocracy.
[00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:35.039]  Or Alex says he's the judge.
[00:52:35.139 --> 00:52:35.880]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:52:36.769 --> 00:52:41.429]  I haven't criticized this judge yet because I haven't seen him go out of his way to get me.
[00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:42.449]  He just hasn't done me any favors.
[00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:48.010]  And I... I don't think the judge has made this decision.
[00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.710]  I think my instincts, my spirit...
[00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:57.070]  would be able to call this right now.
[00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:02.989]  I've been sitting here feeling like, oh, we're going to win?
[00:53:04.469 --> 00:53:05.889]  Because that judge knows...
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.760]  There aren't any promotions you side with Alex Jones in America.
[00:53:15.019 --> 00:53:17.340]  Or maybe he just doesn't care and he's a patriot.
[00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:23.809]  Or maybe he knows we're winning and that's doing the right thing to do sometimes when the tides turn is the right thing to do.
[00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:24.929]  Doesn't matter.
[00:53:25.449 --> 00:53:26.530]  I know the truth.
[00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:28.010]  The world knows the truth.
[00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.309]  And I'm going to continue to sue these people because they're not taking my identity.
[00:53:32.489 --> 00:53:38.849]  They're not going to set precedence with us when they get this thing and claim it's theirs and then try to use my likeness and stuff.
[00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:40.630]  I'm going to sue them.
[00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.289]  I already am.
[00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:43.789]  I'm on the offense.
[00:53:43.949 --> 00:53:45.769]  And if you back me, we're going to have incredible victory.
[00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:46.730]  It's a war.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.300]  Your word of mouth, your prayer, your support.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:54:03.380]  But here I am, in the twilight of the mighty Infowars, that's just a website and a studio, and it'll be a hassle to rebuild it and all the rest of it, but it'll just make the Streisand effect and people will want it that much more.
[00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:04.500]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:54:04.599 --> 00:54:05.460]  I don't back down.
[00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:06.179]  I don't give up.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.519]  I don't roll over to fraud.
[00:54:07.659 --> 00:54:12.699]  So I'm going to fight with 110%, whether we win or lose, we win because we fought.
[00:54:14.519 --> 00:54:17.199]  Because we competed for freedom against the tyrants.
[00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:24.260]  But I have to tell you, I'm very kind of nostalgic, even though we're not out of here yet.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:37.300]  I'm like, I think about all the incredible things we've done and what we've been through, and then to have them with this bizarre scam win is a complete indictment of them if it happens.
[00:54:39.099 --> 00:54:54.849]  And intellectually, I can't imagine That the judge could insult his own intelligence and punt this thing, because it's Alex Jones, because I'm so demonized.
[00:54:54.929 --> 00:54:56.369]  Well, that's the system demonizing me.
[00:54:56.449 --> 00:54:57.570]  That doesn't work anymore.
[00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:59.909]  That's backfired.
[00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.590]  But is the judge caught up in the old world or the new world?
[00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.429]  I don't know.
[00:55:05.489 --> 00:55:14.909]  But imagine the defeat of the Justice Department and the corrupt system If he repudiates this fraud.
[00:55:15.369 --> 00:55:22.630]  But I just find it hard to believe, like I said last Friday, an hour before they ruled, they said they'd rule at 1130 Eastern, 1030 Central.
[00:55:22.889 --> 00:55:24.570]  They ruled actually about 1040 Central.
[00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.150]  I shot a video in the parking lot.
[00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.610]  And I said, I predict they will rule against me on most of it.
[00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:38.570]  They need to pull the unfair trade practices because they can take over any business they wanted to, connected to speech, which is what they want.
[00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:42.269]  And they did cut $150 million out of $1.5 billion.
[00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:43.449]  Thanks a lot.
[00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:46.449]  It's like, we're going to shoot you 800 times, not 1,000.
[00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:49.130]  Don't matter after, like, 5, 10 bullets.
[00:55:50.409 --> 00:55:51.230]  That's the analogy.
[00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:52.710]  They're not literally shooting me.
[00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.289]  So they're shooting me full of lies and fraud and lawfare, though.
[00:55:56.449 --> 00:55:58.110]  But that's because I took them on.
[00:55:58.929 --> 00:56:03.349]  You don't think, I love how they used to, the globalists used to death threat me and attack me and pull dirty tricks.
[00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.869]  And then they'd have one of the good cops come and say, you know, things are rough for you.
[00:56:06.909 --> 00:56:07.869]  Why don't you just join us?
[00:56:07.969 --> 00:56:08.429]  Come on.
[00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:09.530]  Don't make it hard on yourself.
[00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.489]  You know, people can really hurt you.
[00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.250]  You know, you're up against some really dangerous people.
[00:56:13.469 --> 00:56:14.710]  I go, so you're the good cop.
[00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:15.869]  Yeah, yeah, we are.
[00:56:15.969 --> 00:56:16.550]  Come on, Alex.
[00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:17.630]  We're a smart guy.
[00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:18.429]  You can have a lot of fun.
[00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.670]  You can have a seat at the table.
[00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:22.050]  We'll listen to what you have to say, but you got to compromise with us.
[00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.789]  You know, I've heard this speech like 15 times before, right?
[00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.489]  Well, how'd you like 50 million a year?
[00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:27.690]  We're getting ready to give it to you right now.
[00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:30.909]  No thanks.
[00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:32.090]  I'll take my soul instead.
[00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:34.570]  There's no price on this integrity.
[00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:36.389]  No price on this soul.
[00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:42.369]  And they're like, okay, you're playing with the big boys.
[00:56:42.909 --> 00:56:47.869]  Oh, you don't think I know you're a bunch of murdering criminals and pedophiles and scum?
[00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:50.250]  That's why I'm fighting you.
[00:56:50.949 --> 00:56:52.190]  Oh, you're evil.
[00:56:52.289 --> 00:56:53.210]  You're thugs.
[00:56:53.369 --> 00:56:54.369]  You're gangsters.
[00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:55.570]  I didn't know that.
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:04.900]  I'm just everywhere saying that and exposing you and trying to rally humanity to crush your ass politically, culturally, with the Great Awakening, which is now happening.
[00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:10.440]  I've just been on a kamikaze mission against you because I'm a dumbass.
[00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.030]  Oh, you're going to sue my parents.
[00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:14.989]  Oh, you're going to try to get women to lie about me.
[00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:16.510]  Oh, you're going to attack me.
[00:57:16.769 --> 00:57:17.949]  Oh, my God.
[00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:20.030]  Oh, my God, you're bad people.
[00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:24.570]  Oh, I better stick my head between my legs and piss on myself in a fetal position.
[00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:26.889]  No, that's not what you get.
[00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:28.230]  You get war.
[00:57:28.889 --> 00:57:30.570]  You get resistance.
[00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:31.969]  And that's what you're getting.
[00:57:32.289 --> 00:57:34.030]  And yeah, you feared the spirit, didn't you?
[00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.190]  And now it's spreading worldwide faster than ever.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.280]  You don't think I don't know I am a kamikaze?
[00:57:40.539 --> 00:57:48.820]  You don't think I don't know that in the information war I'm the equivalent of a suicide bomber with a trillion pounds of TNT on my back?
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:57.539]  You don't think that I haven't been telling you that for 30 years that I'm here as a vessel to destroy you?
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.019]  What are you going to do to me again?
[00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:04.320]  What are you going to do to me again?
[00:58:06.139 --> 00:58:09.159]  I've just been getting your big bosses up close politically.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.860]  I've been getting you up in range.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.260]  And now you feel the explosion.
[00:58:14.519 --> 00:58:15.340]  You like Elon Musk?
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480]  You like Donald Trump?
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.039]  You like Joe Rogan?
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.619]  You like Tucker Carlson?
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.280]  You like all the hottest shows in the world in every language or anti-New World Order?
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.099]  You like being the most hated people on Earth?
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.219]  You like the tide crushing you?
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.380]  You like getting your ass handed to you?
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.380]  You like being annihilated?
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.039]  Because that's what's happening.
[00:58:38.239 --> 00:58:39.539]  You want to annihilate me?
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.920]  You're Captain Ahab tied up in your own tackle.
[00:58:48.199 --> 00:58:49.400]  I'm not going anywhere.
[00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:50.619]  I'm the white whale.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:59.579]  No matter what happens to me, my spirit comes back again and again and again and again and again and always beats you.
[00:58:59.739 --> 00:59:00.099]  Always.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.900]  I'm Moby Dick, assholes.
[00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:04.320]  You're Captain Ahab.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.179]  You're going to the bottom with me.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.679]  And when I come back up, you ain't gonna be tied up on my back.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.440]  You're gonna be at the bottom of Davey Jones' locker.
[00:59:12.579 --> 00:59:13.860]  Because that's my daddy's name.
[00:59:15.099 --> 00:59:15.539]  Alright.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.780]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.039]  I'm gonna find out what's going on.
[00:59:20.119 --> 00:59:30.260]  Play the Tea Party, play Idiocracy, and then play Bound's Poison Shot Report, and I'll have Rob Dew in here with Updates.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:30.699]  Stay with us.
[00:59:31.579 --> 00:59:32.119]  Play it.
[00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:32.400]  Go ahead.
[00:59:35.519 --> 00:59:36.320]  Updates!
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:36.940]  Updates!
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:37.840]  Updates!
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:38.380]  Updates!
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:39.380]  Updates!
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.260]  Updates!
[00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:54.309]  Up above the world you fly, like a tea tree in the sky.
[00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:56.650]  Oh, that was lovely.
[00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:02.530]  And now, my dear, you were saying that you would like to see...
[01:00:05.539 --> 01:00:08.500]  Are you seeking some information of some kind?
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.460]  Oh, yes.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.059]  You see, I'm looking for a...
[01:00:11.059 --> 01:00:11.719]  Clean cup!
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.519]  Clean cup!
[01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:13.500]  Move down!
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.059]  But I haven't used my cup.
[01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:16.380]  Clean cup!
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:16.760]  Clean cup!
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.179]  Move down!
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:17.539]  Move down!
[01:00:17.699 --> 01:00:17.960]  Clean cup!
[01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:18.320]  Clean cup!
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:18.880]  Move down!
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.519]  Would you like a little more tea?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.699]  Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.519]  Ah, you mean you can't very well take less?
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.400]  Yes!
[01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.349]  You can always take more than nothing.
[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.230]  But I only meant that...
[01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:38.730]  And now, my dear, something seems to be troubling you.
[01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:42.170]  Won't you tell us all about it?
[01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:43.909]  Start at the beginning.
[01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:45.230]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:49.250]  And when you come to the end, stop!
[01:00:49.869 --> 01:00:50.269]  See?
[01:00:50.469 --> 01:00:54.889]  Well, it all started while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah.
[01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:56.670]  Very interesting.
[01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:58.750]  Who's Dinah?
[01:00:59.539 --> 01:01:01.159]  Why, Dinah's my cat.
[01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:02.420]  You see...
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.599]  Oh.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.159]  Oh.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.219]  My goodness!
[01:01:19.539 --> 01:01:22.280]  Those are the things that upset me!
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.980]  See all the trouble you've started?
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.980]  Really, I didn't think that...
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.760]  Ah, but that's the point.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.139]  If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.860]  Clean cup!
[01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:29.539]  Clean cup!
[01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:30.320]  Move down!
[01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:30.940]  Move down!
[01:01:31.139 --> 01:01:31.639]  Move down!
[01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:32.619]  Move down!
[01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:34.280]  Move down!
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.039]  Move down!
[01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:39.360]  And now, my dear, as you were saying...
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.559]  Oh, yes.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.679]  I was sitting on the riverbank with, uh...
[01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:45.199]  with you-know-who.
[01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:46.260]  I do?
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.380]  I mean my C-A-T. Tea?
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.639]  Just half a cup if you don't mind.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.079]  Come, come, my dear.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.940]  Don't you care for tea?
[01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:03.780]  Why, yes, I'm very fond of tea, but...
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.480]  If you don't care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation.
[01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:09.760]  Well, I've been trying to ask you...
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.619]  I have an excellent idea.
[01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:13.400]  Let's change the subject.
[01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.829]  Why is a raven like a writing desk?
[01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.389]  Riddles?
[01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:22.750]  Let me see now.
[01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.949]  Why is a raven like a writing desk?
[01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:29.130]  I beg your pardon.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.300]  Why is a raven like a writing desk?
[01:02:31.679 --> 01:02:32.719]  Why does what?
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.420]  Careful!
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.920]  She's stark raven mad!
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.699]  But it's your silly riddle!
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.280]  You just said...
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.940]  How about a nice cup of tea?
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.599]  Have a cup of tea indeed!
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.739]  Well, I'm sorry, but I just have the time!
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.179]  The time!
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.000]  The time!
[01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:49.440]  Who's got the time?
[01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:50.460]  No, no, no, no!
[01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:51.840]  No time, no time, no time!
[01:02:52.019 --> 01:02:52.800]  Hello, goodbye!
[01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:53.960]  I'm late, I'm late!
[01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:55.550]  The White Rabbit!
[01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:56.670]  Oh, I'm so late.
[01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:58.289]  I'm so very, very late.
[01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:00.389]  Well, no wonder you're late.
[01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.570]  Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.
[01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:04.710]  Two days slow?
[01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:05.889]  Of course you're late.
[01:03:06.969 --> 01:03:07.889]  My goodness.
[01:03:09.329 --> 01:03:10.730]  We'll have to look into this.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:11.769]  Aha!
[01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:14.429]  I see what's wrong with this.
[01:03:14.769 --> 01:03:17.090]  Why, this watch is full of wheels.
[01:03:17.409 --> 01:03:18.090]  Oh, my boy!
[01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:19.829]  Oh, my wheels!
[01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:20.510]  The springs!
[01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:24.429]  Butter, of course.
[01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.489]  It needs some butter.
[01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.550]  Butter!
[01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:27.829]  Butter!
[01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:29.289]  Butter?
[01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.750]  Butter.
[01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:31.769]  Oh, thank you, butter.
[01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:33.469]  Yes, that's fine.
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.250]  Oh, no, no.
[01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:35.050]  No, no, no.
[01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.150]  You'll get crumbs in it.
[01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:38.250]  Oh, this is the very best, butter.
[01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:39.610]  What are you talking about?
[01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:39.949]  Tea.
[01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.590]  Tea?
[01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:42.530]  Oh, I never thought of tea, of course.
[01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.789]  No.
[01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:43.269]  Tea.
[01:03:43.969 --> 01:03:44.550]  No, not tea.
[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.989]  Sugar?
[01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:46.570]  Sugar, two spoons.
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:47.849]  Just two spoons.
[01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:48.630]  Thank you, yes.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.119]  Jam?
[01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:51.579]  Jam?
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.119]  I forgot all about jam.
[01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:55.840]  Mustard?
[01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:58.079]  Mustard, yes, but...
[01:03:58.079 --> 01:03:58.980]  Mustard?
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.460]  Don't let's be silly.
[01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:03.780]  Lemon, that's different.
[01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.519]  That should do it.
[01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:22.110]  There's only one way to stop a Mad One!
[01:04:26.289 --> 01:04:27.730]  There's only one way to stop a Mad One!
[01:04:31.489 --> 01:04:36.289]  Joe was arrested for not paying his hospital bill and not having his UPC tattoo.
[01:04:36.889 --> 01:04:45.130]  He would soon discover that in the future, Justice was not only blind, but had become rather retarded as well.
[01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:53.550]  I'm fixing to commensurate this trial here.
[01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:57.489]  We gonna see if we can't come up with a verdict up in here.
[01:04:58.039 --> 01:05:08.119]  Now, since y'all say you ain't got no money, we have proprietarily obtained for you one of them court-appointed lawyers.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.440]  So put your hands together and give it up for Rico Pendejo!
[01:05:14.219 --> 01:05:15.320]  You're my lawyer?
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.800]  Says here you, uh...
[01:05:18.759 --> 01:05:19.880]  Robbed a hospital?
[01:05:20.539 --> 01:05:21.539]  Why'd you do that?
[01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:22.699]  Yeah, I'm not guilty.
[01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:24.559]  That's not what the other lawyer said.
[01:05:25.059 --> 01:05:27.199]  Listen, you gotta get me on the stand, okay?
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.199]  I can explain everything.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.239]  We can take him to your house.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.639]  We'll show him the prob that I came here.
[01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:30.659]  Get up!
[01:05:30.679 --> 01:05:31.000]  Get up!
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.000]  Get up!
[01:05:32.519 --> 01:05:32.780]  Nah.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:33.960]  Prosecute him.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.820]  Why you think you done it?
[01:05:36.179 --> 01:05:37.440]  Okay, number one, your honor.
[01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:39.139]  Just look at him.
[01:05:41.219 --> 01:05:43.099]  He talks like a fine, too.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.800]  We've got all this, like, evidence of how, like, this guy didn't even pay at the hospital.
[01:05:51.579 --> 01:05:53.760]  And I heard that he doesn't even have his tattoo.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.460]  I know.
[01:05:55.739 --> 01:05:57.780]  And I'm all, you've got to be shitting me.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.980]  But check this out, man.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.340]  Judge should be, like, guilty.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.119]  Peace.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:07.659]  Jackson!
[01:06:08.119 --> 01:06:10.440]  What are you objectifying on?
[01:06:10.619 --> 01:06:11.940]  Come on, just get me on the stand now.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.179]  Okay.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:12.780]  Okay.
[01:06:13.539 --> 01:06:22.380]  Um, Your Honor, I object that this guy also broke my apartment to shit.
[01:06:22.639 --> 01:06:23.099]  Yeah.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:23.960]  What?
[01:06:24.239 --> 01:06:25.199]  And you know what else?
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:31.760]  I object that he's not going to have any money to pay me after he pays back all the money he stole from the hospital.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.960]  Don't say I stole.
[01:06:33.079 --> 01:06:33.739]  You're my lawyer.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.039]  And I object.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.579]  I object that he interrupted me while I was watching Owl My Ball!
[01:06:40.199 --> 01:06:45.880]  That is not okay to arrest my I'm pretty sure we have a mistrial here, sir.
[01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:48.000]  I'm gonna mistrial my foot up your ass.
[01:06:48.099 --> 01:06:48.860]  You don't shut up.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.300]  Please listen.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.300]  Please listen.
[01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:54.440]  I didn't steal anything.
[01:06:54.639 --> 01:06:55.659]  I was part of an army...
[01:06:55.659 --> 01:07:03.280]  Joe stated his case logically and passionately, but his perceived effeminate voice only threw big gales of stupid laughter.
[01:07:05.139 --> 01:07:09.760]  Without adequate legal representation, Joe was given a stiff sentence.
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.610]  All right, Rob, you've been here 16 years at InfoWars.
[01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:18.570]  And of course, that's just a building in the name.
[01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.690]  The InfoWars, information war belongs to everybody.
[01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:21.750]  Nobody can take that name.
[01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:22.630]  Nobody's going to stop us.
[01:07:22.989 --> 01:07:27.829]  They've now admitted that they want to own the catalog and try to erase everything I've said because they're so scared because it's all come true.
[01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.769]  That just causes a Streisand effect.
[01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:31.110]  Everybody out there understands that.
[01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:35.269]  They can't stop the people's army of the great awakening that's happening.
[01:07:35.429 --> 01:07:41.809]  But you've been here when they tried to shut it down in May 31st without a court order and the judge got rid of that, U.S. trustee.
[01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:43.250]  You've seen what happened here.
[01:07:43.369 --> 01:07:45.070]  You've been listening the last two days and watching.
[01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.710]  We've had it on video as well, but we can't show it because that's federal law.
[01:07:47.889 --> 01:07:50.849]  There's people that are parties to it and watch it, or you can go there physically.
[01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:54.050]  But you have written notes, and it's still ongoing right now.
[01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.449]  Sometime tonight, the judge says he's going to rule.
[01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:04.730]  Rob, I mean, try to describe this, people, because it's like trying to describe the insanity of Alice in Wonderland tea party scene.
[01:08:04.889 --> 01:08:06.110]  It makes no sense.
[01:08:06.429 --> 01:08:12.409]  Well, so kind of like when Alice is falling down the hole and it's all slow motion, that's kind of the beginning of this whole process.
[01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.769]  It's slow motion.
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:22.329]  The one side representing the Connecticut families and the trustee are all asking really slow, deliberate, tedious questions.
[01:08:22.329 --> 01:08:24.810]  They're going over and over again over every detail.
[01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:30.170]  And then finally, yesterday, For the first part of the day, it was the auctioneer.
[01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:34.210]  And then we got to the cross-examination, which is where all the good stuff starts happening.
[01:08:34.369 --> 01:08:37.890]  And so that happened, but it's later in the day as you're listening to it.
[01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.510]  So you don't know if that has an effect on the judge.
[01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:45.729]  They ended last night around, I think, about 6.30, started at 1.30, or 1, ended at 6.30.
[01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:47.029]  Now, today they started at 1.30.
[01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.149]  They're still going now.
[01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:49.630]  We're at almost 9 o'clock.
[01:08:50.289 --> 01:09:00.149]  We're on the second attorney on the, I would say, for representing First United, which is, we're going to call those the good guys, the good guy bidders.
[01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:04.329]  And Walter Sissak is the attorney there, and he's asking some great questions.
[01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.310]  In fact, I just really started taking hardcore notes.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.439]  At that process, listening to it.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.119]  And so I'll just go over a few things with everybody, just so everybody's kind of up to speed.
[01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:19.159]  So Global Tetrahedron and the Connecticut families, we're going to call them the joint bidders.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:19.739]  Well, that's Bloomberg.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.000]  Yeah, and also Bloomberg and everybody else in the gun control lobby.
[01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:27.659]  And then First United is the people that are doing it.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.539]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:31.720]  This is the group keeping it going, keeping it going over and over again.
[01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:32.600]  And so...
[01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:37.689]  Because they used my name to stay in the news and raise money for gun control.
[01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:38.229]  Exactly.
[01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.970]  He's attacking us.
[01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.909]  He's peeing on us.
[01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:41.409]  Right.
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:42.630]  Literally.
[01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:54.890]  The $1.75 million, which is what the joint bidders bid in cash, plus they call it a distributable proceeds waiver, We could just consider that monopoly money because it doesn't really exist.
[01:09:55.310 --> 01:10:01.930]  There's no cash value, although they're trying to assign a cash value to it, but it doesn't really exist as money as cash.
[01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:03.630]  It's just a concept.
[01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.649]  And then First United bid 3.5 million in cash.
[01:10:06.989 --> 01:10:10.510]  They admit that both these groups put the 10% down that they needed to do.
[01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:11.390]  That's all good.
[01:10:11.529 --> 01:10:20.979]  But during opening statements, what was interesting back yesterday, the Attorneys for the joint bidders kept saying, well, these processes are never perfect.
[01:10:21.119 --> 01:10:21.739]  It's never perfect.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.760]  Well, this is to cover up the stuff that all came out today, just now, of they were filing wrong paperwork with wrong numbers.
[01:10:27.859 --> 01:10:29.560]  They let them amend it several times.
[01:10:29.739 --> 01:10:37.220]  So they're saying not perfect is they're trying to hurry up and finish this up, get us out of the building, shut down this operation.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.720]  Because it wasn't money after that.
[01:10:40.859 --> 01:10:45.380]  They were pledging my future earnings that is on appeal, plus the money's not there anyway.
[01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:51.020]  Right, and they thought if they could just ram it through, nobody would really look at the details and go, wait a minute, we have questions.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:56.420]  They just think they could go, oh, it's Alex Jones, like they said in that Good Morning America interview where, you know, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.460]  How does your less money win?
[01:10:58.539 --> 01:10:59.380]  He goes, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.439 --> 01:11:00.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.300]  That's the way it works, you know?
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.619]  So that was interesting during the opening statements.
[01:11:05.619 --> 01:11:07.060]  Now that's finally come to pass.
[01:11:07.159 --> 01:11:08.020]  You see where that goes.
[01:11:08.159 --> 01:11:15.140]  So they agreed that they got to change their bid after the fact from what they wanted to initially bid was $100K over the highest bid.
[01:11:15.239 --> 01:11:18.180]  So they bid some money and then say, but we want to bid in reality.
[01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:19.979]  We want a formula that's $100K over.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  It's worse.
[01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:29.920]  They created a secret floating chart that no matter how high someone was, they would then magically pledge more of their future money from me to it.
[01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:30.350]  Right.
[01:11:30.729 --> 01:11:32.210]  You ever heard about an auction like that?
[01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:33.850]  That's where this money comes from.
[01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:39.090]  This distributable proceeds wafer is all the money that they don't have, but they supposedly are going to get from you.
[01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:40.270]  So it's a floating...
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:49.300]  It's like if you're at Vegas and the slot machine's rigged and it actually gets you triple cherries, it has a little program in it that keeps flipping until it goes to something else.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:49.819]  Exactly.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.579]  Oh, it's a bomb.
[01:11:50.779 --> 01:11:53.720]  Oh, it's a black jackpot, whatever.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.699]  Whatever it does to get you not to get the triple cherries.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.119]  So the trustee went on to say that the joint bidders, they figured out how to make the bid work and be the best and highest.
[01:12:02.119 --> 01:12:04.039]  He actually said they figured out how to make it work.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.680]  So they had this bid, then they got together, and then they figured out how to make it work.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.920]  But then the rules said they're not supposed to talk to anybody else about it.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:09.460]  Exactly.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.659]  And then they told the other real bidder, You've got to only have cash in his rules and his other rules for them.
[01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:16.819]  They have this distributed proceeds waiver.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.720]  We had a real DOJ indictment.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.880]  Should have killed it right there.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.579]  He was asked several times about the $7 million.
[01:12:23.579 --> 01:12:24.239]  That's bid rigging.
[01:12:24.539 --> 01:12:25.260]  Sure, yeah.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.060]  That's price fixing.
[01:12:26.199 --> 01:12:26.359]  Right.
[01:12:26.819 --> 01:12:27.760]  That's collusion.
[01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:29.979]  Those are all crimes under the U.S. code.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:30.359]  The collusion goes in here.
[01:12:30.659 --> 01:12:32.680]  But it's my judgment.
[01:12:34.079 --> 01:12:36.100]  He has a magic Justice Department.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:36.439]  Why?
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:36.800]  Right.
[01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:38.720]  It's a Fed thing.
[01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:44.779]  The Feds are always allowed to do what they want, and then they make it up and they go, oh, we have a provision in here that allows us to do whatever we want.
[01:12:44.939 --> 01:12:45.119]  You see?
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:49.460]  It's like, well, normally we need warrants to spy the American people, but we have this special court that gives us blanket ones.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.159]  Exactly.
[01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:55.880]  All we need to do is find somebody that they might have talked to on the other side of the world, then we can look at everything they've ever done.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.079]  So then they agreed so that the bid was hypothetical.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.760]  He agrees several times that the $7 million bid is hypothetical.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.979]  So they keep saying $7 million.
[01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:04.619]  But it says, please approve on the cover letter.
[01:13:05.159 --> 01:13:07.420]  And it says in there $7 million the whole time.
[01:13:07.579 --> 01:13:07.760]  Right.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.079]  And it's never clear that they start parsing words.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.619]  Well, in our definition, this word means it isn't $7 million.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.060]  Exactly.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.420]  And the judge is like, excuse me?
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.000]  And then the judge does the math and goes, well, wait, even under your system...
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.979]  The first United Companies is bigger.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.819]  Did you hear that a few hours ago?
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.079]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:25.760]  That was a few hours ago he said that.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:34.479]  And in fact, the first United said, well, they allowed them to amend their bid later after the other group amended theirs twice.
[01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:37.100]  You would think with a judge saying that, that means it's over for them.
[01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:39.899]  But then he would say, but is it your business discretion that was okay?
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.020]  Yes, that's what he said.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.119]  On the record for the appeal, it sounds like the other way, like...
[01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:45.409]  But you waved the magic wand.
[01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:47.630]  He goes, and you thought that in your best judgment today?
[01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:49.050]  He goes, yes, that was my best judgment.
[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:50.810]  So that's what it seems to be.
[01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:52.090]  He's referring to that, but yes.
[01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.350]  You put your baby in the microwave and put it on for five minutes.
[01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.210]  Well, that's your best judgment.
[01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.609]  Yeah, I gotta dry the baby.
[01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:57.630]  I gotta dry the baby.
[01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.409]  I'm not saying the judge is thinking that.
[01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:03.010]  I'm just saying, I mean, imagine.
[01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:04.850]  Well, I didn't think of it like that.
[01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:06.949]  I'm driving back here in the car listening to it on the phone.
[01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:07.170]  Right.
[01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.069]  You know, because you dial in by video or phone.
[01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:10.090]  I'm just listening to that.
[01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:11.430]  It's like, oh, wow, the judge is really getting him.
[01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:14.130]  And it's like, but you have the best judgment, right?
[01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:14.510]  Right.
[01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:15.689]  You thought that was- He already made off.
[01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:47.090]  So the trustee's going to write a check to somebody else.
[01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:51.510]  It's not money coming in, it's money going out, which kind of defies logic, right?
[01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:52.510]  Does that defy logic?
[01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:54.430]  He just says, well, I'm going to write a check for it.
[01:14:54.770 --> 01:15:01.750]  And just now I was listening in and he says the distributor proceeds waiver has uncertainties while cash does not.
[01:15:01.869 --> 01:15:04.649]  They admit cash is king as long as they have it.
[01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:12.329]  He admitted that he did not let First United change their bid after he let the other joint bidders change their bid, although they finally did let them later on.
[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:13.970]  But this whole process...
[01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:14.750]  But let's explain again.
[01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:25.229]  They're pledging for what, you know, over two-thirds of the quote money to have the highest bid that it's my future earnings that they're going to get that's on appeal.
[01:15:25.489 --> 01:15:25.850]  Right.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.460]  That's on appeal.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.479]  And they go, well, the appeals court only took $100 million off, which you think is a lot.
[01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:35.760]  $150 million, which you think is a lot of money, but not in this judgment.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:44.760]  And they even started trying to bring in parts of the case, which the other side was objecting to, because of the way they called the different damages.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.039]  And I didn't write that down, so I don't want to get into that.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.260]  New York versus Solomon versus.
[01:15:48.279 --> 01:15:49.560]  They did bring up New York v.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:49.960]  Sullivan.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:16:02.800]  It's a way, way higher burden of proof for the press, but the judges in Texas, Connecticut already found me guilty beyond the fact that they would not let us have press arguments.
[01:16:03.399 --> 01:16:04.960]  People say, why didn't your lawyers make these arguments?
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:05.720]  They weren't allowed.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.079]  We were already found guilty.
[01:16:07.079 --> 01:16:08.479]  We were just there as a show trial.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:14.939]  And I knew it was a show trial, but when I got there, it was actually produced by HBO in Austin and in Connecticut, run by them.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.140]  Yeah, the bald guy was over there in the corner with his camera.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.300]  The guy that did all the fake documentaries about Michael Jackson.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.060]  Michael Jackson, yep.
[01:16:21.739 --> 01:16:31.359]  So the first filing, he admits that the first filing with the court that they filed and said, this is the winning bid, it was still the wrong formula, which wasn't real money, of course.
[01:16:31.399 --> 01:16:34.340]  It's just this made-up money that they're talking about.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:38.180]  And it was still $100,000 over what the other guys bid.
[01:16:38.739 --> 01:16:40.880]  So it would have been $3.6 million instead of $1.7 million.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.760]  And that's because it's floating.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.380]  So then they...
[01:16:43.409 --> 01:16:50.250]  It looks like they actually followed the one rule of not telling them what the other bid was that beat them, but then they go, bloop, a little bit above it.
[01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.949]  Exactly.
[01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:55.050]  And then they look at that and they go, oh, and then nobody noticed that it was wrong.
[01:16:55.109 --> 01:16:56.390]  They filed it with the court.
[01:16:56.850 --> 01:17:00.329]  That email with the filing went out to 15 lawyers.
[01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:06.390]  Nobody said anything, and they didn't even notice it until they were getting ready for the depositions.
[01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:07.550]  That's when they noticed the error.
[01:17:07.649 --> 01:17:08.989]  Oh, we've got to fix this.
[01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:12.609]  I don't want to make predictions unless I see all the evidence and then I have this little feeling.
[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:13.130]  Yeah.
[01:17:13.289 --> 01:17:24.649]  But I've heard almost having the feeling, I don't think the judge can certify this, even if the judge was bad, which I'm not saying he is, because unless they just think all the other courts above it are going to go ahead with this.
[01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.569]  It could be.
[01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.489]  Because we're going to appeal this.
[01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:28.670]  I mean, how the hell could anyone approve this?
[01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:34.029]  Well, one thing that kind of freaked me out is when the judge said, well, we're going to go until this is done tonight.
[01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:37.630]  He wanted to end this tonight, but he said that before the cross-examination had happened.
[01:17:37.909 --> 01:17:40.550]  And I was talking with Harrison, and that's when we both...
[01:17:41.329 --> 01:17:45.850]  When we heard that, we're like, oh, that's not a good sign because he's only listening to one side of the story.
[01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:52.930]  But now that you got all this cross-examination and there's dunks going on all over the place, you know, that they admit they didn't see the error till later.
[01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:56.550]  And then, let's see, the trustee admitted based on what the auctioneer and the...
[01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:59.270]  So they were making based on payouts.
[01:17:59.539 --> 01:17:59.899]  Let's see.
[01:18:00.199 --> 01:18:04.720]  He admits he colluded with the joint bidders to rework the distributable proceeds waiver.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840]  This is the monopoly money.
[01:18:06.739 --> 01:18:08.560]  And then get it to what...
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.439]  So the trustee says, well, I thought it meant this.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.859]  They thought it meant something else.
[01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:14.279]  And we had a meeting and then we decided what it was going to be.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.119]  Okay.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.279]  And then the trustee admitted the distributable proceeds waiver was not in the original bid that he accepted as the final bid.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.399]  So the monopoly money wasn't even in their final bid.
[01:18:24.539 --> 01:18:27.020]  That's what he admitted just now that I was listening to.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.939]  I've been told to my lawyers now that Murray literally has tears in his eyes right now.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.880]  This just came in.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.899]  They said he has literally...
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.260]  I think he knows he's done some wrong stuff.
[01:18:39.619 --> 01:18:41.039]  Let me tell you.
[01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:46.119]  I have, you know, Shelby Jordan is a prestigious bankruptcy lawyer.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.439]  Highest quality, totally ethical.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:50.800]  You talk about old Texas.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.039]  I mean, this guy's like the real deal.
[01:18:52.239 --> 01:18:54.600]  And then Walter Sissack is known as the bulldog.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.060]  He has a very famous lawyer.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.840]  They don't ever file that people are criminals.
[01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:01.579]  They put it in my lawsuit and the other one.
[01:19:01.659 --> 01:19:03.100]  They actually say, this is criminal.
[01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:07.369]  And, you know, here's the U.S. code, and that's saying, refer it to the Justice Department.
[01:19:07.529 --> 01:19:09.850]  And it was in their opening statements, too, that they said that.
[01:19:10.069 --> 01:19:11.869]  They didn't just put that in writing.
[01:19:11.949 --> 01:19:13.090]  They said it in front of the judge.
[01:19:13.369 --> 01:19:13.489]  Because it is!
[01:19:13.789 --> 01:19:13.949]  Yeah.
[01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:20.189]  And then the trustee admits him he let them change their bid again, which he called making the bid more beneficial.
[01:19:20.869 --> 01:19:25.449]  So, and then, but he admits that he didn't go to the other side and tell them, hey, I'm letting them change their bid.
[01:19:25.489 --> 01:19:26.369]  Do you want to change your bid?
[01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.470]  I want to make an approximation.
[01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.250]  This is not a prediction.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.899]  I think the judge orders a new auction.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:40.119]  What he should do is give it to the real highest bidder.
[01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.819]  That's the law in an auction or in a sports game.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.659]  Somebody's disqualified.
[01:19:43.939 --> 01:19:44.760]  Yeah, the backup bid.
[01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:46.220]  Disqualify them.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:50.899]  I mean, you catch the boxer and they've got a lead wrench in their glove.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.000]  Sorry, this person wins.
[01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:57.560]  The fact that he talked with them so many times and then allowed them to reinterpret what they were going to do.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.000]  It's not like cleanup to me.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.039]  Yeah, and they had charts.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.000]  That's the part that makes me think he's going to...
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.380]  Well, I think, yeah, so, and I'm guessing here.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:18.380]  I would imagine the middle road is to not repudiate Murray completely because it embarrasses the whole system so much.
[01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:20.920]  But the real thing would be to just call for his indictment, which judges can do.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.760]  That would really, people would think, oh, the system's not corrupt.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:27.180]  But the right thing, and I've talked to everybody about this, not just my own opinion, the lawyer's.
[01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.500]  The middle ground will be just to order a new auction.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.000]  Right.
[01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:34.060]  And then God knows what Murray will do this time.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.920]  And then I think it's going to get crazier.
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:39.359]  And I think more people will jump in because they'll see how low it actually was.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.220]  And people keep saying, like, how does this keep going?
[01:20:41.279 --> 01:20:42.420]  This is what a fight looks like.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.039]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:47.119]  You know, we had a six-year war with the British starting in 1776. You know, that's what July 4th's about.
[01:20:47.319 --> 01:20:49.859]  It's not just about, you know, hamburgers and beer.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.699]  That's fireworks and boats and girls in bikinis.
[01:20:52.779 --> 01:20:53.239]  That's all great.
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.039]  But what it's really about is taking on the British Empire as a ragtag group.
[01:20:57.579 --> 01:20:57.939]  And...
[01:20:58.359 --> 01:21:01.680]  You know, right there, I forget the point I was going to make about that, but...
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.279]  Well, the War of 1812 was three years.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.680]  Oh, I was going to say, it was a six-year war, at least.
[01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:05.979]  Yeah.
[01:21:06.119 --> 01:21:07.720]  And we lost the first five.
[01:21:07.939 --> 01:21:08.119]  Right.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.579]  But it was perseverance.
[01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:10.779]  It was not stopping.
[01:21:11.039 --> 01:21:12.279]  And see, that's what you're not doing.
[01:21:12.319 --> 01:21:15.140]  And this is a good example for people out there who, like, want to give up.
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.739]  You look at Alex Jones right here.
[01:21:16.979 --> 01:21:20.899]  Instead of going, oh, okay, maybe I'll just listen to him and I'll go hide in my hole.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:21.859]  Hold on, don't give me the credit.
[01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:22.159]  No, no, no.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.579]  You do deserve some credit here because you didn't stop.
[01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:24.760]  You know me.
[01:21:25.649 --> 01:21:32.930]  By the way, I don't say that to go, oh, we're giving out participation trophies.
[01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:39.689]  It's not good to say I'm the reason this happened because that's how everybody keeps thinking like that.
[01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:43.010]  It's like that hero model where one guy does it all.
[01:21:43.069 --> 01:22:02.130]  One guy might We're good to go.
[01:22:10.039 --> 01:22:11.880]  Number one, how do I not persevere?
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.539]  I'm saying they're an evil satanic world government death cult wants to kill us because it's in their own documents.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.880]  Everybody's waking up.
[01:22:18.039 --> 01:22:19.720]  How the hell am I not supposed to?
[01:22:19.979 --> 01:22:23.479]  It's not persevering to fight for our survival.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.340]  No, I totally agree.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.260]  I mean, I'm not fighting for my life here.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.460]  This is not perseverance.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.079]  And staying in the arena is what has kept all this stuff coming out.
[01:22:33.159 --> 01:22:35.260]  George Washington had death warrants on him and his whole family.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.340]  There's nowhere to go.
[01:22:37.479 --> 01:22:38.979]  John Hancock signed it so big.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.380]  He said, if I'm going to be on a death warrant, I'm going to sign that sunbed.
[01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:43.520]  You're going to go, go hard.
[01:22:43.819 --> 01:22:44.840]  You're going to go, go big.
[01:22:44.979 --> 01:22:45.899]  I'm just saying, people.
[01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:49.300]  Look, a lot of people get frustrated.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.020]  They go, look at Joe Rogan.
[01:22:50.079 --> 01:22:50.720]  He's just like you now.
[01:22:50.779 --> 01:22:51.840]  He did it when the tide turned.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.560]  I don't care.
[01:22:53.399 --> 01:22:54.020]  I don't care.
[01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.550]  He was telling me four years ago, he was totally awake.
[01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:58.949]  He was still being careful about it.
[01:22:58.949 --> 01:22:59.289]  That's what he does.
[01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.789]  I don't care.
[01:22:59.869 --> 01:23:00.270]  That's fine.
[01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.670]  It's okay.
[01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.470]  We don't have to be territorial about this.
[01:23:03.569 --> 01:23:08.090]  But yeah, we're the OG. This audience of activists, this crew, we're it, folks.
[01:23:08.369 --> 01:23:11.149]  We are the 1776ers.
[01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:12.869]  And we really got to commend the people out there.
[01:23:13.109 --> 01:23:17.250]  And listen, we couldn't have been done without the crew and the audience.
[01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.630]  Yeah.
[01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:19.430]  So, I want to explain that.
[01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:21.949]  It's a huge, that's the reason we're still here.
[01:23:22.050 --> 01:23:23.489]  That's the reason all this stuff is coming out.
[01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:29.689]  Because if we stopped, Alice, if we stopped doing this, like months ago, you would never learn about all this other corruption.
[01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:30.270]  It's like Trump.
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:31.350]  Trump didn't stop.
[01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:36.529]  So, one of the top lawyers, one of my lawyers, yesterday, said, why hasn't he given up yet?
[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:37.409]  Like, it's a real question.
[01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:38.170]  Yeah.
[01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:40.109]  That's funny.
[01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.250]  Well, as they said, they said, you need to go make more money.
[01:23:42.449 --> 01:23:43.810]  We know, working for somebody else.
[01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:46.250]  Why does he keep spending all his money fighting us?
[01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:48.869]  And it's like, well, this is the hill to die on, you dumbass.
[01:23:49.069 --> 01:23:49.649]  It is.
[01:23:49.829 --> 01:23:50.729]  It pretty much is.
[01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:52.609]  This is our Stalin, Greg.
[01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:55.649]  And we didn't do anything wrong at the end of the day.
[01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.729]  We didn't do anything wrong.
[01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:03.189]  And the reason we know we didn't do anything wrong is because there wasn't a real trial talking about the merits of what was said and what wasn't said.
[01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:05.029]  There was just a, you're wrong.
[01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.850]  You don't have the evidence we're looking for.
[01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:07.529]  So...
[01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:08.689]  You're in default.
[01:24:08.909 --> 01:24:09.869]  And that's how it worked.
[01:24:09.989 --> 01:24:17.329]  And you made money off these people you barely ever talked about while they run years of PR, TV, and internet ads raising money off saying I'm being mean to them.
[01:24:17.449 --> 01:24:18.670]  I should have sued them right now.
[01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:19.270]  I don't even understand.
[01:24:19.369 --> 01:24:20.949]  I'm like, no, they're raising money off people.
[01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:21.989]  What the hell is this drama?
[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:26.430]  Well, and then looking at money you're bringing in and calling that profit and considering that profit.
[01:24:26.569 --> 01:24:30.369]  Like, oh, you made several hundred million dollars over 10, 15 years.
[01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:31.729]  That's the money you made.
[01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:32.729]  The way it works is...
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:38.840]  We would have corporate filing and then individual tax filing.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.380]  We would show the gross on each.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:41.500]  You would duplicate the number.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:41.979]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:50.100]  The first time the New York Times, right before they sued me, like six, seven years ago, they ran this big headline saying, Jones makes $120 million something dollars a year.
[01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:52.020]  Well, I knew what they had.
[01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:56.979]  They'd gotten the tax returns that she, my ex-wife had gotten in lawsuits that went back over a decade.
[01:24:57.199 --> 01:25:00.699]  They looked at the biggest year and they counted both the corporate and individual tax returns.
[01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:00.899]  Oh, as double.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:01.840]  As double.
[01:25:01.939 --> 01:25:02.079]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:05.479]  So we brought in $62 million that year.
[01:25:05.619 --> 01:25:06.020]  Gross.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:06.439]  Right.
[01:25:06.539 --> 01:25:08.119]  They called it $124 million.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:08.439]  Right.
[01:25:08.859 --> 01:25:11.479]  And then go, well, that must be what he's making every year.
[01:25:11.479 --> 01:25:14.239]  So he's got at least this much money in the bank.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:14.880]  And what did they say?
[01:25:14.939 --> 01:25:16.180]  $400 million you were worth?
[01:25:16.539 --> 01:25:17.199]  $360 million.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.159]  $360 million.
[01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:18.920]  In trial.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.220]  They said I had $360 million.
[01:25:20.239 --> 01:25:21.439]  Based it off one sheet of paper.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.119]  He had a sheet of paper that he was looking at.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.500]  And he never examined our books.
[01:25:24.579 --> 01:25:24.779]  No.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.140]  Meanwhile, I owed $3.5 million in bills then.
[01:25:28.319 --> 01:25:28.439]  Right.
[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.289]  And had $3 million in the bank.
[01:25:30.989 --> 01:25:32.850]  And then right after, I had nothing.
[01:25:33.029 --> 01:25:36.369]  So we tried to tell the judge, Your Honor, we have our bank statements and sworn bankruptcy.
[01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:37.390]  She goes, I'm not going to hear that.
[01:25:37.649 --> 01:25:38.970]  Remember, I said, ma'am, I'm in bankruptcy.
[01:25:39.029 --> 01:25:39.890]  She goes, no, you're not.
[01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:44.010]  You want to control the facts and lie and say what you say is real.
[01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:44.770]  It's not true.
[01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:47.609]  As you told the jury, he's guilty and he has hundreds of millions.
[01:25:47.829 --> 01:25:53.569]  The way this operation works is money comes in, we throw it right back into the fire to keep the train moving.
[01:25:53.729 --> 01:25:54.409]  That's how it works.
[01:25:54.510 --> 01:26:01.909]  The point is they said we had all this money so the jury would believe we could give them that much money when they knew we didn't have the money because they wanted it to be impossible to pay.
[01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.470]  Exactly.
[01:26:02.649 --> 01:26:05.210]  Well, nobody could pay a $1.5 billion judgment.
[01:26:05.329 --> 01:26:11.529]  Well, the Texas jury said we don't think he's that guilty, but since he's got $360 million, we talked to him after you're allowed to have the law.
[01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:13.670]  Six of the nine talked to our lawyers.
[01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:18.699]  And they all said, well, since he has $360 million, we thought $44 million was 10% of his money.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.739]  And meanwhile, it was $45 million more than I had.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.560]  I was literally like half a million in the tank then.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.560]  But again, it's hilarious.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:35.619]  That's why when they came in the Connecticut thing and said $100 million to this person, $90 million to that person, $130 million to this person, I was laughing.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.060]  And they said, why are you laughing?
[01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.659]  And I said, it's like saying I own $50 trillion.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.420]  It's monopoly money.
[01:26:41.619 --> 01:26:43.359]  I mean, it's money that doesn't exist.
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.220]  It doesn't exist.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.119]  And then the $2.75 trillion, the GDP of India.
[01:26:51.409 --> 01:26:53.489]  By the way, every time they say that, people don't believe me.
[01:26:53.949 --> 01:26:57.310]  Like, I was at the gym a week ago, and the guy goes, yeah, I heard you're willing to have judgment.
[01:26:57.489 --> 01:27:00.590]  I said, no, they asked for $2.76 trillion.
[01:27:00.829 --> 01:27:03.010]  And the guy goes, for $2.75 trillion.
[01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.090]  There it is.
[01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.890]  He's got $100 million.
[01:27:05.869 --> 01:27:06.949]  Oh, they looked at Bloomberg.
[01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:09.869]  And I pulled it up on my phone and he went, you're kidding.
[01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:12.949]  And I said, yeah, dude, the GDP of India.
[01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:16.090]  It doesn't make sense at all.
[01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:18.029]  It's hilarious, dude.
[01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:23.409]  But, you know, a lot of this is based on an operation where they think they can control reality.
[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:25.810]  The people that represent this, this whole system.
[01:27:25.810 --> 01:27:29.590]  Saying I got 2.75 trillion pounds is like saying I got, you know, I can have babies.
[01:27:29.829 --> 01:27:32.590]  And they think, well, they think you could probably do that.
[01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:33.630]  They think you can have babies.
[01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:34.550]  You get you a butt baby.
[01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.949]  You know, that's how gross these people are.
[01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:41.149]  They think they could just invent things and that we all have to believe their insanity.
[01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:43.130]  And so they go on and on.
[01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:44.869]  And if you don't stop them, they're going to keep coming.
[01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:54.729]  And then they file weird derivative stuff off future earnings of mine that's on appeal that no one ever said was money, saying it has to be only a cash offer in the rules for anybody else.
[01:27:54.909 --> 01:27:56.449]  And then they didn't even do the math.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:57.260]  Right?
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.420]  Multiple times they had to change it after they entered orders of the judge.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.199]  There's another word they use in here, which is something inherent value.
[01:28:05.479 --> 01:28:07.760]  I took a screenshot of it because...
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.039]  I remember the...
[01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:10.420]  Where did the rest of the money...
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.359]  I implied equivalent value.
[01:28:12.479 --> 01:28:15.640]  So I interpret the $7 million to be sort of an implied equivalent value.
[01:28:15.779 --> 01:28:16.939]  What does that even mean?
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.619]  What does that even mean?
[01:28:18.619 --> 01:28:23.159]  The lawyers are asking them, they go, so real cash isn't as good as implied equivalent value.
[01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:23.739]  And he goes...
[01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:26.000]  And, of course, you didn't tell the other bidder about this.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.600]  He goes, well, no, because it wasn't a currency they have.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.380]  Right, yeah.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.840]  So, see, they did a deal where there's a magic currency they won't tell you about.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.819]  It's literally a shit coin.
[01:28:36.819 --> 01:28:44.579]  Because why do you get to know about this magic currency you don't have that we're going to use that doesn't exist?
[01:28:44.779 --> 01:28:45.140]  Exactly.
[01:28:45.659 --> 01:28:47.800]  It is literally a made-up shit coin.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.239]  That's what this has gone to.
[01:28:49.399 --> 01:28:55.359]  It's gone above and beyond the insanity brigade of level of just retardedness.
[01:28:55.359 --> 01:28:58.340]  And now they want this judge to certify this.
[01:28:58.659 --> 01:28:59.039]  Yeah.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.060]  Because they already had judges certify that I send people to pee on graves.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:02.399]  Right.
[01:29:02.539 --> 01:29:06.199]  And again, my lawyer, in the few questions you can ask, he goes, who peed on your grave?
[01:29:06.279 --> 01:29:06.640]  I don't know.
[01:29:06.819 --> 01:29:08.020]  Did you see anybody peeing on your grave?
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:08.199]  No.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:08.800]  Do you have any proof?
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.000]  No.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.960]  Well, how'd you hear about it?
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:11.659]  Well, somebody told me who.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.319]  I don't know.
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.140]  I don't know, yeah.
[01:29:13.439 --> 01:29:17.920]  Someone you don't know told you that someone peed on a grave that you don't know who they are?
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.840]  That is hearsay, hearsay, hearsay, hearsay.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.920]  Just, you know.
[01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:28.329]  It's amazing that it's even gotten this far.
[01:29:28.909 --> 01:29:30.090]  And that nobody's put a...
[01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:33.949]  Like, there's no judge out there that seems to have the backbone to go.
[01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:35.970]  And maybe Judge Lopez will have it.
[01:29:35.989 --> 01:29:37.609]  A lot of these judges are scared of the corporate media.
[01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.890]  Sure.
[01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.470]  You want to be attacked by the corporate media.
[01:29:39.569 --> 01:29:39.710]  Right.
[01:29:40.069 --> 01:29:41.170]  But they think it's bad.
[01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:42.069]  They think they'll get attacked.
[01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.590]  Well, you don't want this Kid Rock shooting up your Bud Light.
[01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:46.149]  That makes you lose $40 billion.
[01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:49.470]  See, people care about real people.
[01:29:49.609 --> 01:29:50.729]  And Kid Rock's not perfect.
[01:29:50.789 --> 01:29:51.729]  He's a wild man, all that.
[01:29:51.869 --> 01:29:53.310]  But people go, that's a real guy.
[01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:58.819]  See, they don't like things that aren't authentic, and the power structure is not authentic.
[01:29:59.159 --> 01:30:00.680]  I'm going to let you host for a little while.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:01.699]  Okay.
[01:30:01.859 --> 01:30:02.600]  I've been interrupting you.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.319]  I don't have a earpiece in.
[01:30:04.319 --> 01:30:04.659]  It's okay.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.100]  I'm not going to go even listen to the court thing.
[01:30:06.439 --> 01:30:08.060]  You have been here for 16 years.
[01:30:08.199 --> 01:30:08.680]  You've hosted.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.859]  You've shot countless reports.
[01:30:10.039 --> 01:30:11.479]  You have devastated the New World Order.
[01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:12.880]  Rob, just talk about Infowars.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.479]  Talk about the crew.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.260]  Talk about the supporters.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:17.020]  Talk about the epicness, because this could easily be the last night we're here.
[01:30:17.239 --> 01:30:18.119]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:19.579]  And I just feel good anyway.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.899]  Whatever happens, we're the good guys.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.800]  We didn't lie.
[01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:23.619]  We're for real.
[01:30:23.619 --> 01:30:25.260]  And I'm just honored to know all you guys.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.359]  And I've been interrupting you, so you take a few minutes.
[01:30:27.439 --> 01:30:27.739]  All right.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.859]  I'm going to go take a piss.
[01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:31.670]  Well, you know what?
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:32.569]  I'm going to start at the beginning.
[01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:35.090]  I'm going to start at the beginning and just walk people through.
[01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:36.510]  It's ongoing, by the way.
[01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:39.689]  The beginning and it's not the end.
[01:30:40.069 --> 01:30:42.470]  So, where to start?
[01:30:42.949 --> 01:30:58.100]  Back in 2007, no, 2009, actually 2008. I answered a Craigslist ad that was looking for producers slash editors slash camera people for a fast-paced news environment, is what was told.
[01:30:58.279 --> 01:30:59.960]  So I said, okay, that sounds good.
[01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:02.000]  Actually, I go, that kind of sounds like Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.739]  I've been a listener for years.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.380]  So that wasn't even...
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:11.960]  I actually went and saw 9-11 Road to Tyranny at the original Alamo Drafthouse with my friend.
[01:31:12.079 --> 01:31:14.319]  And what blew me away most about that...
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:25.800]  This movie, documentary, was not the 9-11 information, it was the information on Oklahoma City that people had taped at their houses using VCRs.
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:34.340]  So many people might not know what a VCR is, but we used to have these things that had big cassette tapes, and you'd put them in and it would record onto tape the video.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:46.680]  And so people were recording live video of the Oklahoma City bombing where newscasts were live going, well, we've got a report now that there's a second bomb in the building.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.180]  And then a few minutes later, we now have a report that there's a third bomb in the building.
[01:31:50.399 --> 01:31:53.319]  And the second and third bombs were bigger than the first.
[01:31:53.619 --> 01:32:00.100]  And then a guy standing on the street, he goes, yes, right behind me, you can see the bomb squad truck going into the scene to pull out the second and third bombs.
[01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:07.220]  And then you see the bomb squad truck with the little trailer that's got the little, I guess, capsule where they put the bombs driving off.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:07.899]  Okay?
[01:32:08.079 --> 01:32:09.859]  All this is happening in real time.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.060]  People are watching it.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.539]  And then it comes back later.
[01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.380]  Oh, it wasn't a bomb inside.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.220]  It was a car bomb.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.979]  And then it went from a car bomb to a truck bomb.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.079]  So that...
[01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:26.850]  That video, watching that video in a theater with my friend was like a huge...
[01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:30.250]  I was already awake, but it was a big awakening for me.
[01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:31.390]  So I'd already...
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:41.420]  Ben, an Alex Jones Info Warrior, watching his shows on Access, listening to the radio show as much as possible, listening to it on stream.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.859]  Interestingly enough, Alex is one of the first people to take the stream and just repeat it.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:55.039]  So when the show ends, which you could watch right now if you're on band.video, if you get to the end of the show, you just keep watching, it starts right back over again.
[01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:57.529]  So you could sit there and watch it again and watch it again.
[01:32:57.529 --> 01:32:59.390]  So I would listen to it throughout the day.
[01:32:59.529 --> 01:33:01.149]  Couldn't listen to it all straight through.
[01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:03.149]  But you pick it up, you're like, oh, this is a good part.
[01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:06.050]  Or, oh, this is kind of a slow part.
[01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:09.210]  I'll put my headphones down and maybe pick it back up in like 20 minutes or so.
[01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:16.229]  Maybe it's a Bob Chapman segment on gold, which Bob Chapman was an interesting guy, but I didn't really...
[01:33:16.909 --> 01:33:19.710]  I wasn't too big into the economics that he was into.
[01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:21.409]  But good thing.
[01:33:21.689 --> 01:33:27.090]  Fast forwarding to 2008, I answer a Craigslist ad, send my resume in.
[01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:27.750]  I get a call.
[01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:34.270]  A guy named Mike's on the phone and he says, well, I just want you to know this is working for Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:35.869]  And he just kind of stopped like that.
[01:33:35.909 --> 01:33:36.550]  I said, okay, that's cool.
[01:33:36.609 --> 01:33:37.770]  He's like, oh, okay, great.
[01:33:37.989 --> 01:33:42.050]  So they made a time when I could come in, do an interview.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:55.840]  I was a producer working at a jewelry network selling jewelry to people on TV, sort of like a QVC, but a knockoff from England.
[01:33:58.039 --> 01:34:01.180]  But I'd also produced a bunch of other DVDs in my time.
[01:34:01.199 --> 01:34:11.800]  This is 2008, 7 and 8, but I had stuff going back to 2004. And so I bring in a bunch of the things I've produced, and I'm pulling them out of my backpack.
[01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.579]  And Alex is literally on the air right next door.
[01:34:14.579 --> 01:34:17.539]  It was in his original studio, and he had barbecue.
[01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:20.439]  And I remember the guest he had was the sheriff's deputy.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.180]  I forget his name, but he had a video series called Never Get Busted.
[01:34:24.779 --> 01:34:28.199]  And also a series called Never Get Raided.
[01:34:28.859 --> 01:34:30.899]  Barry Cooper, I think, was his name.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.399]  Anyway, Alex would come in during break, and first he came in and met me, shook my hand, walked out, and then he came back in for another break.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:43.640]  I guess it was the three-minute or four-minute break, and he's looking at all the DVDs that I had, and he's like, what's this one?
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:59.220]  And I said, oh, this is a DVD for the city of South Padre Island, and we made this DVD. This band wanted a music video, but they didn't have money, so we went to all the different businesses around and got them to put up money, and then we filmed it at those locations,
[01:34:59.359 --> 01:35:00.180]  but then it grew...
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:09.840]  So many businesses wanted to do this that we made a DVD and then the island decided to make half a million of these DVDs and put them out in their tourism kits.
[01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:11.619]  So it had an audience.
[01:35:11.819 --> 01:35:12.699]  It had a captive audience.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.460]  You could tell people about the different things on the island.
[01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:21.560]  So we made, you know, enough money to make the production and, you know, a little bit extra, which was great.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.619]  And so I'm showing him that and telling him about it.
[01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:27.520]  And he goes, I think he had a piece of brisket in his hand.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.819]  And he goes, That's the kind of thinking we need around here.
[01:35:29.939 --> 01:35:31.479]  And he took a bite out of it and walked out.
[01:35:31.619 --> 01:35:35.000]  And the guy, Mike, looks at me and he goes, I guess you got the job.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:43.939]  And so that's how I started at Infowars back in, I think, February 9th, 2009 was when I was my first day.
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:56.250]  So just as Obama came into office and I got here, I was hired with three other guys and one of them He wasn't really up to speed on what was going on in the Alex Jones universe.
[01:35:56.550 --> 01:36:01.050]  I would say he was a normie into sports and stuff, and he didn't last very long.
[01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:11.250]  One of the reasons I knew he wouldn't last very long is because we got hired in February, and he wrote down his birthday on his calendar in March and said he'd be taking that day off because that was his birthday.
[01:36:11.369 --> 01:36:13.890]  And I'm like, you're taking a day off and you haven't even been here a month?
[01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:14.930]  Wow, okay.
[01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:18.510]  So, that was one of the many...
[01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:20.289]  And here's another thing about...
[01:36:20.289 --> 01:36:25.689]  There's people that come in the InfoWar and you see them and they do things and the people leave the InfoWar and it's...
[01:36:25.689 --> 01:36:27.149]  You know, sometimes it's...
[01:36:28.279 --> 01:36:29.520]  It's a lot of pressure.
[01:36:29.739 --> 01:36:30.659]  We work a lot.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.960]  We work hard.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.100]  We work long hours.
[01:36:33.279 --> 01:36:35.659]  And a lot of people can't take that.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:42.659]  And they can't take truthfulness, whether it's critique of their work or even suggestions or just the amount of work.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.479]  And so they end up moving on.
[01:36:44.619 --> 01:36:51.380]  And, you know, no disrespect to anybody that's ever come in here, because just to get in here, you have to be pretty badass to make it.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:59.760]  And like the crew we have now, They could go into any production environment and they would blow anybody else away.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:07.140]  I've been in little production environments where they rehearse the entire hour show that they're gonna do before they do the show.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:09.819]  Then they do the show and they still make mistakes.
[01:37:10.289 --> 01:37:14.729]  These guys may make one or two mistakes a week, but it's all live.
[01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:15.729]  It's all unscripted.
[01:37:15.869 --> 01:37:18.409]  Nobody knows what Alex Jones is going to say until he says it.
[01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:28.430]  And then, you know, a video or something he sees in an article may bring up something that happened months ago or years ago or a decade ago, and boom, we find it.
[01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:30.489]  I think the Cynthia McKinney video was interesting.
[01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:31.850]  You just called for that the other day.
[01:37:31.989 --> 01:37:35.789]  Well, it's still on YouTube, which I can't believe that her...
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.020]  Going after Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:39.500]  Exposing the government child kidnapping rings.
[01:37:39.699 --> 01:37:47.819]  Child kidnapping rings and, you know, the missing money that we seem to just have lots of money, 50 billion now to give a loan to the Ukraine.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:49.479]  And it just never ends.
[01:37:49.579 --> 01:37:50.359]  There's never any money.
[01:37:50.479 --> 01:37:54.739]  There's no money for the people in North Carolina, but there's plenty of money for people in Ukraine.
[01:37:54.739 --> 01:37:57.079]  So I came in and it started off.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.300]  I was answering phones.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:37:59.539]  I was getting articles.
[01:37:59.539 --> 01:38:00.880]  I was finding clips.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:06.779]  Then Alex started to do more documentaries, so I started going out on the road shooting documentaries.
[01:38:07.079 --> 01:38:12.380]  You know, we'd interview people for three and a half, four hours, and maybe use five, ten minutes of it in a documentary.
[01:38:12.819 --> 01:38:16.939]  But we had all this great, we were interviewing great people, so it was really good knowledge.
[01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:29.250]  And then finally, like, you know, a year or so after we'd shoot these interviews, we'd put them out as whole Cloth, you know, short documentaries, which I think that's probably some of the best stuff we'd ever done up until that point.
[01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:37.869]  And then the whole shift goes from doing documentaries and long-form interviews into streaming live events, which kind of happened with the Michael...
[01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:46.510]  Brown incident outside of St. Louis in Ferguson where every night people would come out and riot and they would attack businesses.
[01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:51.930]  And this is where I think we first heard of the Oath Keepers because the Oath Keepers were called in to protect businesses.
[01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:53.109]  People were calling them in.
[01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:54.369]  They're like, oh, look at it.
[01:38:54.409 --> 01:38:56.210]  It's white racists helping these people.
[01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:59.930]  And it was black people asking these white racists to come protect their business.
[01:38:59.949 --> 01:39:01.029]  And they were going to do that.
[01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:04.569]  So it was kind of interesting how that whole model worked.
[01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:30.600]  And so we were there shooting on these Teradex And by the way,
[01:39:30.619 --> 01:39:32.180]  our mission was never...
[01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.250]  Corner or market or market analysis.
[01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.770]  No, it never was.
[01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:35.750]  That's just how it happened.
[01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:36.689]  It was whatever we thought was interesting.
[01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:39.729]  Yeah, and we just happened to be there showing it and people wanted to see it.
[01:39:39.869 --> 01:39:40.170]  All right.
[01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:41.069]  So it went on and on.
[01:39:41.329 --> 01:39:43.710]  Rob- I got about just a quarter of the way through.
[01:39:43.949 --> 01:39:44.949]  No, I want you to keep going.
[01:39:45.569 --> 01:39:47.609]  It's just that I've been up since 5 a.m.
[01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:52.119]  I know some of the morning crews here- What's it sound like out there?
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.060]  The judge just said this may go to basically midnight.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.760]  But that he's ruling tonight.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:57.380]  Oh, yes.
[01:39:57.739 --> 01:39:58.979]  We have to stay on.
[01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:00.340]  We've got to take calls.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.220]  No, I'm not complaining.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.560]  It's just that...
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.340]  I mean, what are you going to do tomorrow?
[01:40:05.279 --> 01:40:06.960]  Well, that's another big issue.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.819]  I love you bringing up these stories.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.260]  I was listening to it in between a phone call to my family.
[01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:13.479]  Rob...
[01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:16.350]  I mean, if we shut down, we will be on the Alex Jones Network.
[01:40:16.489 --> 01:40:16.630]  Yep.
[01:40:17.069 --> 01:40:19.289]  And we've got the little studio, bigger ones getting completed.
[01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:20.130]  AJN Live.
[01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:21.270]  I don't own it.
[01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:24.369]  I don't own the AlexJonesStore.com, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:40:24.529 --> 01:40:30.270]  So the bad guys will have a real tough time shutting down something I don't own with all their fake claims and all their fake garbage.
[01:40:30.689 --> 01:40:37.050]  That's why it's important for people to get their Christmas shopping done there, incredible products, Patriot gear, the very best supplements, so much more.
[01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:41.550]  It takes money to win a war, so just buy great stuff from good people, and you fight the new world order.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.100]  Great Christmas sweaters.
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:48.539]  We've put all the limited edition fundraiser posters on 50% off.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.840]  We need to raise funds right now.
[01:40:51.199 --> 01:40:53.659]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:40:53.659 --> 01:40:55.479]  I want to thank all of you that are the info warriors.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.359]  I know you're out there listening.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.060]  You know, we could also...
[01:40:59.569 --> 01:41:03.329]  Well, let me just say this about that Christmas ornament and that Trump on a stump.
[01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:08.550]  That's something you're going to dig out 20 years later when you have, like, kids or grandkids.
[01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:09.590]  And they're going to be like, what's that?
[01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:17.550]  And you're going to explain to them how you were part of this second, or third even, you know, revolution to take back your government.
[01:41:17.649 --> 01:41:18.390]  That's not as global.
[01:41:18.659 --> 01:41:20.720]  Yeah, and really to just wake people up.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.600]  And it's a real momentum.
[01:41:22.079 --> 01:41:22.819]  It really is.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.260]  It really is.
[01:41:23.319 --> 01:41:32.600]  So that's something you could look at and go, and you're going to see, like, we just dug out a bunch of ornaments, and I'm looking at stuff from 1974, like one of the year I was born, an ornament that had my hand on it.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:32.960]  We're the same age.
[01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:34.340]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:35.859]  I'm older than you.
[01:41:35.979 --> 01:41:39.159]  You are, by a month and a few days, by a month and ten days.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:39.539]  I am your elder.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.479]  A month and nine days, actually.
[01:41:41.819 --> 01:41:46.060]  Hey, seriously, I'm going to let you get back and listen to the court thing.
[01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:46.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.039]  They're doing...
[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:49.810]  Redirect now?
[01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:50.430]  Yeah, redirect.
[01:41:52.630 --> 01:42:01.180]  But no, I mean, we will be Again, the last time they took us off air, and I told the crew this, I said, I think it's going to be a rigged auction.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.220]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.460]  And I said, yeah.
[01:42:03.539 --> 01:42:05.079]  And I said, be ready here Thursday morning.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.560]  They'll try to shut this place down at 8 a.m.
[01:42:06.859 --> 01:42:08.119]  The auction's Wednesday.
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:11.260]  They already said they wouldn't tell us until Thursday, 8 a.m.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.000]  And that was days before I said, it's rigged.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.020]  They won't tell us.
[01:42:14.079 --> 01:42:15.199]  The bad guys are going to get it.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.380]  And I said, I think they'll show up about 8 a.m.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.340]  because they're not thinking about my show.
[01:42:19.439 --> 01:42:20.039]  Harrison will be on.
[01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:21.079]  So I said, everybody get there early.
[01:42:21.199 --> 01:42:22.899]  I'll take over Harrison's show when they shut us down.
[01:42:23.439 --> 01:42:24.739]  They want to gleefully do it.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:32.420]  And so I got here at 7.45, and then they came at 8, and I argued with the U.S. trustee.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.819]  And I said, you don't have a judge's order.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.220]  This thing's a fraud.
[01:42:37.079 --> 01:42:39.699]  I'd learned that they took derivatives, made up money.
[01:42:40.439 --> 01:42:42.020]  And so we stayed under at about 10.30.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.060]  He was out here threatening us.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.680]  I'm going to tell the judge, you violated the stay.
[01:42:44.699 --> 01:42:46.100]  You're violating a federal agent's orders.
[01:42:46.279 --> 01:42:47.220]  Well, I said, where's your order?
[01:42:47.539 --> 01:42:48.720]  Have you even gotten the money yet?
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.720]  I haven't heard the judge say that the sale's certified.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.359]  I don't believe that he'll certify this.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.260]  We'll see tonight.
[01:42:54.039 --> 01:42:54.399]  And...
[01:42:55.610 --> 01:43:01.789]  So, he then calls, because he has those numbers, he calls the internet service providers and stuff and has the internet turned off.
[01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:03.850]  They said he's turning it off.
[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:04.430]  They're on the phone.
[01:43:04.489 --> 01:43:06.689]  I said, all right, you guys stay here on air.
[01:43:06.789 --> 01:43:08.449]  I'm going to the other studio, so I'm on at 11 a.m.
[01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.770]  for sure.
[01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:11.670]  I walk in five minutes before, and they go, yeah, they cut the feed.
[01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.550]  So off to the radio stations, everything.
[01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:18.050]  The next day, I'm going on air at 11 a.m.
[01:43:18.090 --> 01:43:19.970]  They call and say, Chris Murray says you can come back.
[01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:22.050]  He's going to let you back in the building.
[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:23.350]  I said, let me back.
[01:43:23.449 --> 01:43:25.770]  He knows that they hijacked this place.
[01:43:25.909 --> 01:43:27.890]  And the judge said, no, you're not supposed to do this.
[01:43:27.989 --> 01:43:28.630]  You better stop it.
[01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:40.649]  Here we are, almost a month later, that was the 14th, so we're talking, you know, 26 days later, and here they are trying to explain all this stuff to the judge.
[01:43:40.789 --> 01:43:51.210]  I don't know what's going to happen, but regardless, even back then I said, but that day, because it's a new studio, we haven't really done a lot of stuff out of here, it's going to be a train wreck.
[01:43:52.439 --> 01:43:55.460]  And so I said, that Thursday and Friday, we'll just do my show.
[01:43:55.579 --> 01:43:59.380]  But I said, Harrison and Owen can come on with me and then do the afternoon.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.520]  And of course, we had a few technical things and I was right.
[01:44:02.979 --> 01:44:05.840]  And then some people thought, like, Alex doesn't actually want me.
[01:44:06.319 --> 01:44:07.260]  I hadn't told him that.
[01:44:07.319 --> 01:44:12.859]  I'm like, no, I told you for a few days, it'll just be my show because we got to work the bugs out and a lot's going to be happening on deck.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.420]  You eat the enchiladas first, and then you got the beans and rice.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.880]  But then the Friday we were back, and I brought the sink in.
[01:44:19.039 --> 01:44:20.399]  Like, you know, let that sink in.
[01:44:20.859 --> 01:44:24.399]  And then most of the crew knew we were going to survive.
[01:44:24.439 --> 01:44:27.300]  I love the crew, but some of them were just like, I was like, look, we've got people.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.479]  We've got the listeners.
[01:44:28.479 --> 01:44:29.359]  We're going to continue on.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:30.500]  And like, Alex, you fought so long.
[01:44:30.539 --> 01:44:30.779]  Come on.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:32.739]  You're not getting back in the building.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.399]  It's not going to happen.
[01:44:34.479 --> 01:44:35.199]  Come on, Alex.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:36.960]  And I love that person.
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:37.819]  I love the people that said that.
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:41.859]  But the point is that It wasn't me.
[01:44:42.119 --> 01:44:43.640]  Well, I mean, I'm not putting them down.
[01:44:43.739 --> 01:44:44.180]  It's just a story.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:50.479]  But I... That was because I heard the judge at the emergency hearing Thursday.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.939]  I'd already called it that morning.
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:57.239]  Saying nobody should be happy with how this auction happened.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:57.960]  Satisfied.
[01:44:58.659 --> 01:44:59.060]  Satisfied.
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.100]  And he goes...
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:00.960]  You pull it up.
[01:45:01.079 --> 01:45:02.399]  I think that quote was...
[01:45:02.399 --> 01:45:03.500]  No one should be...
[01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:05.289]  Confident?
[01:45:05.489 --> 01:45:05.989]  Was it confident?
[01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:07.930]  Something about that.
[01:45:07.989 --> 01:45:10.869]  Type in Judge Chris Lopez comments on the auction.
[01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:12.310]  It's in AP Reuters everywhere.
[01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:15.770]  But the point is they cut off the rest of the part where he said it didn't go through.
[01:45:16.069 --> 01:45:18.470]  Then he said it at more hearings and they still keep saying they own the place.
[01:45:18.569 --> 01:45:22.270]  He kept saying it's going back to status quo before the auction took place.
[01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:25.989]  Which meant the day before the auction how things were running.
[01:45:25.989 --> 01:45:27.289]  He said the sale did not go through.
[01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:29.010]  The onion is not the owner.
[01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:33.130]  But they still got it and that's a major cause right there.
[01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:37.630]  But again, they have this attitude that, well, Bloomberg's behind us, we can do whatever we want.
[01:45:38.909 --> 01:45:41.029]  So, I don't know what's going to happen with the judge.
[01:45:41.289 --> 01:45:43.069]  Well, it's Bloomberg and it's Alex Jones.
[01:45:43.289 --> 01:45:43.569]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:44.350]  That's what they think.
[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:51.649]  So, I don't know what the judge is going to rule, but it is the process that's on trial here, not us.
[01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.569]  Yeah.
[01:45:52.710 --> 01:45:59.649]  But regardless, whether it's in this studio tomorrow, or whether it's from the Alex Jones Network, follow me at AJNLive.com.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.439]  We will be there.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.859]  And that's the site that has some placeholders on it.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.460]  It'll be a news site, alexjones.network.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.500]  It'll have the feeds and all that.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.439]  And there's a bunch of other websites and everything else.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.119]  So that's the coordinates.
[01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:18.220]  And just let people know, hey, this is the empire trying to, you know, take out the rebel base.
[01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:21.140]  No one should feel comfortable with the results of this October.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:21.739]  Yeah.
[01:46:22.829 --> 01:46:23.289]  What did I say?
[01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.750]  Confident?
[01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.170]  Yeah.
[01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.710]  Comfortable.
[01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.130]  Yeah.
[01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:28.750]  So, but then he went on, and by the way, it didn't happen.
[01:46:29.289 --> 01:46:32.489]  But if you go to, and my lawyer's like, well, should we do a TRO to make them stop?
[01:46:32.609 --> 01:46:33.529]  And he goes, they're smart.
[01:46:33.630 --> 01:46:34.409]  They've got smart lawyers.
[01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:35.149]  They know to stop.
[01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:36.069]  Nope.
[01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:37.850]  Go to global tetrahedron website.
[01:46:38.029 --> 01:46:38.210]  Yeah.
[01:46:38.529 --> 01:46:39.449]  They say they're us.
[01:46:40.939 --> 01:46:43.239]  And some listeners still don't understand that.
[01:46:43.279 --> 01:46:45.260]  And you go, we're sorry we can't support the Alex on the store.com.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.500]  I don't own that.
[01:46:46.779 --> 01:46:47.899]  Infowars doesn't own that.
[01:46:47.979 --> 01:46:48.539]  Bigly does.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.779]  That's the sponsor.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.239]  They cannot get that.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:54.119]  That's an established company that's been around for a long time.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.859]  Makes some of the top patriot apparel for Trump supporters.
[01:46:57.650 --> 01:47:00.510]  Okay, they sponsor dozens of big shows.
[01:47:01.029 --> 01:47:02.010]  Steven Crowder, you name it.
[01:47:02.170 --> 01:47:11.770]  So, and notice you've seen like Chris Maddy and the Democrat Party lawyers, prosecutor people, former prosecutor that, and he's like, oh, anybody tries to work with him, we're coming after him to get them too.
[01:47:11.949 --> 01:47:13.149]  You can't do that under the law.
[01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:15.949]  These are legitimate people that have their own companies.
[01:47:16.699 --> 01:47:19.819]  But they're going to call anybody I work with, you know, oh, that's really all it shows.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.180]  He has to be in charge of everything.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:22.539]  He has to be the commander of everything.
[01:47:23.119 --> 01:47:26.420]  You want to explain to people, am I a micromanager?
[01:47:26.699 --> 01:47:28.000]  You're not a micromanager.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.840]  You have a way you like to see things done.
[01:47:31.039 --> 01:47:36.640]  And you communicate that sometimes very quickly as you're walking away.
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:42.979]  Sometimes you do it from here in breaks or while somebody's even talking during a video or something.
[01:47:43.159 --> 01:47:44.619]  You're giving direction.
[01:47:44.699 --> 01:47:47.619]  But you're not telling people exactly how they need to do stuff.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.439]  But you have a vision.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:50.180]  The point is, as long...
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.199]  Well, I mean, that's the way this place works.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.520]  There's no top-down craziness.
[01:47:58.359 --> 01:48:01.640]  That's the owner of the company I said I'd work for, and his dad's a top bankruptcy lawyer.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.100]  That's who you're here kicking ass right now.
[01:48:03.399 --> 01:48:06.039]  Walter says, Zach, I had one stipulation.
[01:48:06.619 --> 01:48:08.619]  You don't control what I say, and we keep the crew.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.279]  And that's in my employment agreement that we gave to the trustee, all of it.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:18.500]  And then says, Zach, wouldn't even tell me his bid because he signed an undisclosure.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.479]  He followed it to the T. Right, right.
[01:48:20.659 --> 01:48:21.819]  And I remember saying, is it this?
[01:48:21.859 --> 01:48:22.239]  Is it that?
[01:48:22.319 --> 01:48:22.899]  Well, I can't tell you.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.100]  Well, I think you need to go bigger.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:24.659]  Right.
[01:48:26.979 --> 01:48:28.359]  And I said, watch, it's a setup, buddy.
[01:48:29.199 --> 01:48:30.220]  And they're like...
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:31.100]  100% was.
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:32.699]  And I called it when they...
[01:48:32.699 --> 01:48:36.340]  Yeah, when they went to a non-live auction, that was the other thing, too.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:39.539]  He didn't say the live auction never happened.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.380]  He wouldn't say that.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.039]  Or he would never say it was canceled.
[01:48:42.199 --> 01:48:43.600]  He was like, no, we never canceled the auction.
[01:48:43.659 --> 01:48:44.439]  We just didn't have it.
[01:48:44.699 --> 01:48:46.140]  It's the same thing as canceling it.
[01:48:46.159 --> 01:48:47.140]  It was set on a date.
[01:48:47.699 --> 01:48:49.979]  It got to that date, you didn't have the live auction.
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.760]  And they would have made more money if they didn't have the live auction.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.560]  And when you bait and switch, somebody would do it at the last moment, which they did.
[01:48:53.789 --> 01:48:54.010]  Right.
[01:48:54.329 --> 01:48:55.689]  Oh yeah, they did it the night before.
[01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:59.029]  Like late that night, they said, hey, we need your best and highest bid.
[01:48:59.149 --> 01:49:01.109]  And then they opened them the next day and said, oh, that's it.
[01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:01.510]  It's done.
[01:49:01.869 --> 01:49:03.829]  And then they still put in the wrong paperwork.
[01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:05.130]  You know, and they admitted it.
[01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:06.130]  They put in the wrong paperwork.
[01:49:06.250 --> 01:49:06.970]  They had to admit it twice.
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:08.289]  It's not wrong paperwork.
[01:49:08.409 --> 01:49:09.350]  The judge noticed it.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.199]  And so they put it in repeatedly.
[01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:13.760]  Oh, you think the judge caught it?
[01:49:13.819 --> 01:49:15.699]  They think, oh, see, I think they caught themselves.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.500]  Later, they realized they had the wrong bid.
[01:49:17.579 --> 01:49:18.640]  You think the judge caught it?
[01:49:18.939 --> 01:49:22.960]  Well, how do you get it wrong when it's between 1.7 and 7?
[01:49:23.119 --> 01:49:24.279]  I think they didn't care.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:25.340]  They're just trying to push it through.
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:26.420]  They're saying it's 7 million.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.020]  And they didn't even have, but they didn't have it.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:30.279]  And they're like, wait, where do you see $7 million?
[01:49:30.359 --> 01:49:33.460]  They're like, oh, wait, okay, hold on.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.840]  And then they have to make a call and go, hey, listen, we got to agree with this.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.840]  That's where they admit they got together.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.600]  And they used money that didn't exist.
[01:49:39.979 --> 01:49:40.880]  And then they colluded with it.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.119]  So do you think the judge can certify that?
[01:49:43.529 --> 01:49:44.909]  I don't think he should certify that.
[01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:45.869]  I don't think he will.
[01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:50.670]  But the only thing that kind of freaked me out today is when he said, I'm going to make this ruling tonight.
[01:49:50.670 --> 01:49:52.229]  We're going to go until the end of the night tonight.
[01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:54.470]  And that was before any of the cross-examination had happened.
[01:49:54.609 --> 01:50:00.189]  And when you listen to the first part of it, it sounds like they did everything on the up and up because the trustee's like, I did everything right.
[01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:04.270]  I did everything to the T. All right, Rob, go listen to what's going on right now.
[01:50:04.489 --> 01:50:05.010]  Great job.
[01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.750]  Great job, the crew.
[01:50:05.869 --> 01:50:08.130]  Everybody go eat some pizza if anybody hadn't eaten a salad.
[01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:10.029]  I'm going to stop right here.
[01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:11.729]  I'm going to refocus.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.960]  Because you're not just tuned in to hear about what's happening in Infowars right now.
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.359]  There's big news.
[01:50:17.539 --> 01:50:21.300]  We have a ton of people on X and other places watching and Infowars.com.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.100]  But yeah, by tomorrow morning, it could be the damn Bloomberg's group up there.
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.100]  Boy, they're pissed that we found out it's him.
[01:50:28.199 --> 01:50:28.859]  They admitted it.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.720]  It's in the documents.
[01:50:32.079 --> 01:50:32.439]  So...
[01:50:32.439 --> 01:50:35.159]  We were always thinking it was Soros, but...
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:40.300]  Again, you'll find us at Real Alex Jones and at AJN Live.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:46.460]  And then we'll start populating the news sites like AlexJones.network and others with the news and all of it.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:54.060]  And we want to have the writers and the crew and everybody come over and work for the new company with the folks with Bigly.
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:00.479]  And, you know, there's going to be a hassle to that, getting them signed on the payroll there.
[01:51:01.289 --> 01:51:04.590]  And all the rest of it, but we'll be doing that while we fight the New World Order.
[01:51:04.689 --> 01:51:04.930]  It's okay.
[01:51:04.989 --> 01:51:05.689]  We've done this before.
[01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:08.630]  So we came from the grassroots, and that's what we are.
[01:51:09.489 --> 01:51:11.029]  And so we fought from the bottom.
[01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:13.210]  I mean, that's why I love the song, Eye of the Tiger.
[01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:15.010]  Classic 80s song.
[01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:21.390]  If you listen to the lyrics of Eye of the Tiger, let's play Eye of the Tiger with the lyrics scrolling up on screen.
[01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:24.449]  And then let's air that John Bowne report.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:27.199]  The latest one on the poison shots.
[01:51:27.659 --> 01:51:33.279]  And then I'm going to come back and get to some really important news because I got ready for just this live feed.
[01:51:33.539 --> 01:51:34.560]  Look at these clips.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.939]  Tom Homan on what will happen on January 21st.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:39.199]  This just came out today.
[01:51:40.319 --> 01:51:45.119]  Number two, FBI senior official says Bureau doesn't know who's operating New Jersey drones.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:51.460]  Number three, Breaking White House just announced $50 billion loan to Ukraine.
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.460]  Wait till you hear it.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:56.380]  This sounds like another Bernie Madoff thing.
[01:51:56.979 --> 01:51:59.460]  Four, Elitist Eugenics Depopulation music video.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.979]  Can we get the bleep to one place?
[01:52:01.539 --> 01:52:02.680]  And more.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.319]  So, let's play The Eye of the Tiger.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:11.199]  But let me read the lyrics to The Eye of the Tiger.
[01:52:11.359 --> 01:52:14.039]  It reminds me kind of Teddy Roosevelt's Man in the Arena.
[01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:18.949]  Famous quote, which I've got right here.
[01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:21.770]  I mean, you gotta read the whole speech he gave in Paris, but it never gets old.
[01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.430]  It is not the critic who counts.
[01:52:24.609 --> 01:52:25.630]  I read this every day before I go on air.
[01:52:26.029 --> 01:52:31.930]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[01:52:32.489 --> 01:52:53.430]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:06.319]  And who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, show that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:11.699]  They've been taking his statues down all around the country, even though he's one of the first big civil rights leaders.
[01:53:13.199 --> 01:53:16.020]  But he is a white guy, and he is an American.
[01:53:16.659 --> 01:53:20.239]  You know they're bad, because CNN said so.
[01:53:21.779 --> 01:53:23.020]  So let's go ahead.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.800]  Can we put the lyrics to Iron the Tiger on screen, please?
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.539]  Rising up.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.500]  Back on the street.
[01:53:31.829 --> 01:53:32.670]  Did my time.
[01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:33.550]  Took my chances.
[01:53:33.970 --> 01:53:34.930]  Went the distance.
[01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:36.310]  Now I'm back on my feet.
[01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:37.869]  Just a man in his will to survive.
[01:53:38.369 --> 01:53:40.409]  So many times it happens too fast.
[01:53:40.489 --> 01:53:41.989]  You trade your passion for glory.
[01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:44.810]  Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past.
[01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:46.609]  You must fight just to keep them alive.
[01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:48.250]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[01:53:48.449 --> 01:53:49.489]  It's the thrill of the fight.
[01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:52.029]  Rising up the challenge of our rival.
[01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:54.989]  And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night.
[01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:57.430]  And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
[01:53:58.149 --> 01:54:02.210]  Face to face, out in the heat, hanging tough, staying hungry.
[01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:09.310]  They stack the odds till we take to the street for the kill with the skill to survive.
[01:54:09.869 --> 01:54:11.250]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:14.630]  It's the thrill of the fight, rising up the challenge of our rival.
[01:54:14.829 --> 01:54:19.930]  And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night as he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:23.640]  And finally, rising up, straight to the top.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.720]  Had the guts.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.520]  Got the glory.
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:26.739]  Went the distance.
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.239]  Now I'm not going to stop.
[01:54:28.359 --> 01:54:29.659]  Just a man as will to survive.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.140]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:32.340]  It's the thrill of the fight.
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:34.260]  Rising up the challenge of our rival.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.359]  And the last known survivor stalks his prey of the night.
[01:54:37.399 --> 01:54:39.939]  And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
[01:54:40.239 --> 01:54:41.359]  The eye of the tiger.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.760]  The eye of the tiger.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.079]  The eye of the tiger.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:51.180]  Alright, here it is, and then John Bowne, and then I'm back to cover the big news they don't want you to hear.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.920]  The Mavericks.
[01:55:05.439 --> 01:55:06.680]  The Trailblazers.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:08.659]  The Outlaws.
[01:55:09.699 --> 01:55:10.600]  The Rebels.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.399]  30 plus years in the war.
[01:55:16.239 --> 01:55:35.220]  Rising up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times,
[01:55:35.399 --> 01:55:47.170]  it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory We're good to go.
[01:56:43.759 --> 01:56:45.260]  We're good to go.
[01:57:02.869 --> 01:57:04.270]  We're good to go.
[01:57:05.729 --> 01:57:10.850]  We're good to go.
[01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:24.310]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:58:24.729 --> 01:58:27.409]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:58:28.659 --> 01:58:30.899]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:34.500]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:37.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:58:37.659 --> 01:58:39.539]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:46.000]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:58:46.239 --> 01:58:49.279]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:50.720]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.819]  We're going to get behind.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.239]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:58:55.439 --> 01:58:57.000]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:58:57.109 --> 01:59:01.250]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[01:59:01.409 --> 01:59:02.729]  Again, by design.
[01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:04.390]  And so much more is happening.
[01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:05.430]  This is an exciting time.
[01:59:05.649 --> 01:59:07.609]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:59:07.789 --> 01:59:11.710]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:59:11.829 --> 01:59:13.689]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:59:13.770 --> 01:59:14.649]  So we make it easy.
[01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:24.750]  Go to thealexshownstore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of Patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word to meet like-minded people and support the Infoward.
[01:59:24.869 --> 01:59:34.229]  Now, The folks at Bigly that power the AlexJoStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:35.850]  And I personally love this one.
[01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:39.550]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:59:39.729 --> 01:59:41.989]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:59:41.989 --> 01:59:43.329]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:59:43.649 --> 01:59:45.430]  And this will horrify me.
[01:59:45.590 --> 01:59:50.210]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fearing and walking on the street.
[01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.890]  Say, it's okay.
[01:59:51.329 --> 01:59:52.289]  Alex Jones does it.
[01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:55.989]  Bike, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.

[02:02:02.899 --> 02:02:05.140]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[02:02:05.319 --> 02:02:07.600]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with the fight.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.859]  God bless and good luck.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:10.500]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:13.399]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[02:02:13.539 --> 02:02:16.439]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.220]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[02:03:10.170 --> 02:03:18.989]  Just when the clouds go to the sky, you can see us at the sky.
[02:03:36.829 --> 02:04:02.449]  Alright, at 10.27 Central Standard Time, about four minutes ago, on Tuesday, December 10th, 2024, finally, a judge followed the law in the lawfare fiascos and ruled in InfoWars' favor.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:13.100]  Now, the judge told them 27 days ago, Bloomberg's Everytown, it turned out, is the group behind it.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.180]  The Onion's their front group.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:19.579]  He told them they didn't know it, and he said they need to stop saying that.
[02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:21.500]  They did not stop.
[02:04:24.739 --> 02:04:26.100]  Major cause of action.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.199]  And I'm not a litigious person, but they're trying to destroy us and destroy free speech.
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.840]  So you know what's going to happen to them.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:35.560]  And Michael Bloomberg, Mr. Babyfeet.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.659]  Yeah, Bloomberg, we know all about you.
[02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:48.920]  So, I didn't start this fight, but when I say I'm going after the bad guys, I don't mean the front group and these families they use to manipulate.
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.159]  They're just victims of this process.
[02:04:51.159 --> 02:04:52.199]  I'm talking about the establishment.
[02:04:53.279 --> 02:04:55.779]  So, the judge just ruled in our favor.
[02:05:02.369 --> 02:05:07.229]  You know we put in our filings that we believe a crime has been committed and this should be referred to the Justice Department.
[02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:09.630]  There's a new Justice Department coming in.
[02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:13.909]  I can tell you that they are looking very strongly at this.
[02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:26.189]  They like open and shut cases of bid rigging, of price fixing, and of collusion.
[02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:28.470]  All three of those are felonies.
[02:05:28.489 --> 02:05:29.869]  You're talking 10 years in federal prison.
[02:05:31.670 --> 02:05:33.630]  So everybody better preserve their records.
[02:05:38.770 --> 02:05:44.529]  Judge Lopez is known as an extremely by-the-book guy.
[02:05:45.789 --> 02:05:46.930]  Extremely smart.
[02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:53.329]  And he was dumbfounded by what they did.
[02:05:53.550 --> 02:06:03.510]  It is so ridiculously Bernie Madoff That it would make Bernie Madoff and Sam Bankman-Fried and Mr. Ponzi blush.
[02:06:07.829 --> 02:06:27.350]  When they put in their fraudulent fake derivative bids, after telling anybody else bidding they had to do cash, our lawyers had to have Basically,
[02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:34.770]  math petitions, insurance company, actuarists, try to figure out what this was.
[02:06:34.770 --> 02:06:36.430]  It was designed so no one could.
[02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:44.689]  And we went to the people in depositions last week, the U.S. trustee and the people, and we said, we did your math.
[02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:46.229]  And they went, oh my God, that's a mistake.
[02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:53.289]  They changed it twice in the last week after filings they already had of the magic money that didn't exist.
[02:06:57.369 --> 02:07:00.569]  What they did is a work of art.
[02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:04.550]  It's so grotesque.
[02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:11.689]  You can see art that's fabulously disgusting and evil, but you're like, God, that's a lot of talent.
[02:07:11.869 --> 02:07:16.430]  I mean, this is like, wow, were you on nine hits of acid when you did this?
[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:24.869]  So, I told everybody this, and I said, what's on trial?
[02:07:26.399 --> 02:07:28.380]  Is the federal bankruptcy system here.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:35.579]  Just like I told the Democrats with their show trials where HBO produced it and I was already found guilty before I went in.
[02:07:37.159 --> 02:07:41.560]  Makeup and aiming the cameras and I didn't understand it when I was in the Texas thing.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:47.859]  I knew it was staged but then when I saw that the judge in Texas had the same because I'm sitting up there on the stand that's like a script they had.
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:52.979]  And then I see the same script in her hands in Connecticut a month later, two years ago.
[02:07:53.119 --> 02:07:54.800]  And I was like, ooh, I gotta...
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:58.659]  And then all of a sudden the lawyers were asking me questions and they thought they got me with questions.
[02:07:59.279 --> 02:08:03.199]  And they started smiling like I was upset because I wasn't upset by their questions.
[02:08:03.199 --> 02:08:10.119]  The bottom of my stomach felt like I got a good memory and I'm right here in Texas and Connecticut like six feet from the judge.
[02:08:10.699 --> 02:08:12.880]  Four or five feet in Texas, six feet in Connecticut.
[02:08:13.239 --> 02:08:15.079]  I got, you know, I'm like, what the hell?
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:17.680]  I got a damn script?
[02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:26.579]  That's what the Democrats are.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.020]  They're all like theater majors.
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:28.859]  Most of them are.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:34.760]  That, like, in the real world, try to make everything like a fiction, and then we're all supposed to buy into it.
[02:08:34.779 --> 02:08:36.260]  I'm running around peeing on kids' graves.
[02:08:36.399 --> 02:08:37.239]  Nobody ever did that.
[02:08:38.439 --> 02:08:39.460]  But they just say it.
[02:08:39.539 --> 02:08:41.579]  Well, that son of a bitch is pissing on kids' graves.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:42.479]  I've never been to Connecticut.
[02:08:46.039 --> 02:08:46.399]  So...
[02:08:46.399 --> 02:08:53.800]  I gotta make some phone calls.
[02:08:59.450 --> 02:09:00.829]  And do some things.
[02:09:02.949 --> 02:09:05.750]  But I'm going to come back and talk about this.
[02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:08.170]  But I really appreciate it.
[02:09:08.250 --> 02:09:16.649]  I don't even like doing this because my emotions and my commitment is so strong that when I say this, I mean, I really mean it.
[02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:22.390]  I am so thankful to this crew putting up with me.
[02:09:25.539 --> 02:09:29.539]  Because I'm not a tyrant most of the time, but every couple weeks I flip out.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:35.939]  Because most of the time I'm positive and on the war path and can get myself hyped up to do this.
[02:09:36.739 --> 02:09:39.260]  Because, I mean, it's sick what we cover, but it's real.
[02:09:39.359 --> 02:09:40.680]  You think I like covering all this sick stuff?
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.560]  Well, I do because I like lancing pus.
[02:09:43.979 --> 02:09:45.340]  You know, lancing a big boil.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.600]  You don't want to do it.
[02:09:47.699 --> 02:09:49.619]  It's gross, but it's healthy and it feels better.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.260]  I still don't enjoy doing it.
[02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:58.350]  Some days I just fall into a hole.
[02:09:59.850 --> 02:10:02.750]  Because I'm spending five, six hours researching all this horrible crap.
[02:10:04.649 --> 02:10:06.890]  And then I stare at the abyss too long and I become it.
[02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:08.869]  And the crew has to stare at the abyss too.
[02:10:09.569 --> 02:10:13.750]  But they can also see the great results of fighting this evil.
[02:10:14.569 --> 02:10:16.310]  But I want people to know this is a damn war.
[02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:17.649]  And you're all in it.
[02:10:17.689 --> 02:10:18.569]  You're all targeted too.
[02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:22.810]  And the thing is, you're not going to get out of this crisis unless you admit it and take action.
[02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:26.409]  Show to the crew, to my audience of great activists.
[02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:33.949]  I want everybody out there to know, no matter what color you are, I love your beautiful soul.
[02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:36.189]  I love black people.
[02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:37.890]  I love white people.
[02:10:38.010 --> 02:10:38.789]  I love brown people.
[02:10:38.949 --> 02:10:39.550]  I love everybody.
[02:10:41.989 --> 02:10:48.909]  I hate brainwashed groups that are in all these groups and different tribes of, you know, leftist fools, but I still love them.
[02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:57.489]  But I hate the globalists who know what they're doing and know how people work and then use it against people.
[02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:58.609]  Well then it's our people.
[02:11:01.770 --> 02:11:04.289]  And it's because they're so one-dimensional.
[02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:10.130]  They think you can do bad things to people and that that's not going to come back on you.
[02:11:10.689 --> 02:11:15.090]  Whether you believe in karma or what you sow, what comes around goes around.
[02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:16.069]  The world's a two-way street.
[02:11:17.590 --> 02:11:20.930]  And I feel guilty from a good place being a jerk sometimes.
[02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:27.109]  And I have to struggle all the time catching myself thinking of really nasty, dirty stuff I can do to get people.
[02:11:28.369 --> 02:11:31.649]  And part of maturity is I basically never go there.
[02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:33.390]  I never use the dark side.
[02:11:33.989 --> 02:11:37.470]  Boy, if I did, these bad guys that have so much trouble, they wouldn't even know what to do.
[02:11:37.949 --> 02:11:40.430]  I mean, you guys think you run around practicing evil?
[02:11:40.529 --> 02:11:42.470]  You have no idea because you're so stupid.
[02:11:43.779 --> 02:11:48.279]  But it's smart people that know not to use evil because they know a lot more about it than you do.
[02:11:48.479 --> 02:11:49.979]  That's what you Satanists don't understand.
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.140]  I know your devil way better than you do.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.800]  You're deceived by the devil.
[02:11:57.159 --> 02:12:06.060]  I've been down to the crossroads and almost signed a contract with the actual devil.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.939]  And God saved me at that moment.
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:18.819]  And if I ever told people the story, I'm very close.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:23.720]  It's incredible.
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:29.140]  But consciousness and reality is incredible.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:39.640]  Incredible.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:42.960]  Devil's real, folks.
[02:12:43.779 --> 02:12:44.319]  God's real.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:48.800]  That's the devil's biggest trick, that he doesn't exist, right?
[02:12:48.899 --> 02:12:49.420]  Oh, it exists.
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:51.399]  Oh, it exists.
[02:12:52.539 --> 02:12:54.060]  And you know it does, deep down.
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:57.899]  This is a fight between good versus evil right now.
[02:12:59.039 --> 02:13:01.439]  And I just thank God every day he saved me.
[02:13:03.399 --> 02:13:05.159]  That's why we shouldn't hate these evil people.
[02:13:05.279 --> 02:13:08.479]  We should just defend ourselves from them and help those that want the truth.
[02:13:08.899 --> 02:13:10.239]  Never become like our enemies.
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:14.920]  Best revenge, as Trump has said, is living well.
[02:13:16.170 --> 02:13:17.909]  It's a French saying, but everybody's said in different ways.
[02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:20.390]  The new gladiator is not as good as the first one.
[02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:29.789]  But there's a saying in there where the old leader said, you know, best revenge is not becoming what your enemy is.
[02:13:33.289 --> 02:13:36.489]  And I think that's even more important than living well.
[02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:41.850]  But the truth is, if we're virtuous and strong, we're going to live a lot better.
[02:13:43.250 --> 02:14:01.210]  And The job we have is painful, but if you pull back and see just energetically and spiritually and discernment-wise, intelligence-wise, what you get from facing it, the dividends are a trillion times better than the pain.
[02:14:02.529 --> 02:14:07.890]  Those little moments where I get overwhelmed by it are every few weeks for 10 minutes.
[02:14:09.409 --> 02:14:10.770]  And it's less and less.
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.760]  And I have to remind myself of that.
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.060]  So I'm going to make some calls.
[02:14:22.079 --> 02:14:23.079]  I'm going to come back.
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:36.020]  I do want to say this, not to be dramatic, but now is the time I have to have a lot of concern about my physical safety.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:44.729]  Now is the time that Trump has to, all of you do as well, Because the enemy's losing on all fronts right now.
[02:14:45.789 --> 02:14:47.689]  And that's what I want to recap when I come back.
[02:14:48.850 --> 02:14:56.189]  It is a paradoxical moment we're in of Newtonian third-dimensional alignment.
[02:15:02.369 --> 02:15:04.930]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:24.100]  But it is transcending the third dimension that the metaphysical decision to serve truth that creates an entire new energetic dimensional paradigm.
[02:15:24.659 --> 02:15:28.899]  Yes, good and evil are matched in the third dimension.
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:46.899]  But it is only matched to create the maximum friction to develop the strongest reaction to then project the pure good into the higher order to use a third dimensional model.
[02:15:48.579 --> 02:15:58.939]  This, my friends, is all a purification filter to the stairway to eternity.
[02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:12.279]  If you think we've got fantastical opportunities now, the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God has in store for us.
[02:16:12.439 --> 02:16:13.180]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:13.720]  Stay with us.
[02:16:25.989 --> 02:16:32.149]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas in the recaptured Infowars.com studios.
[02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:36.670]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, waging war on corruption.
[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:38.829]  Massive breaking news straight ahead.
[02:16:39.450 --> 02:17:06.590]  Rising up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet We're good to go.
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:51.780]  We're good to go.
[02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:27.850]  Left the guts, got the glory.
[02:18:29.350 --> 02:18:33.930]  Worth the distance now, I'm not gonna stop just a man.
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.200]  The Eye of the Tiger.
[02:19:40.139 --> 02:19:47.600]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we can celebrate the judge doing the right thing with the most ridiculous, fraudulent auction known in human history.
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.620]  I mean, I'm not even saying that to exaggerate.
[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:52.420]  It is frickin' cuckoo bird, okay?
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:55.920]  Absolute bonker land.
[02:19:56.139 --> 02:19:57.079]  The judge today is so...
[02:19:57.079 --> 02:19:57.920]  How much was the winning bet?
[02:19:57.959 --> 02:19:58.600]  We can't tell you.
[02:19:59.059 --> 02:20:01.680]  Depends on how much money we get from Jones over the next few decades.
[02:20:04.399 --> 02:20:09.340]  And you gave other rules to the actual people with cash who had put more money down?
[02:20:10.209 --> 02:20:14.530]  And said they couldn't use credit, but then you did a form of credit no one's ever heard of?
[02:20:15.709 --> 02:20:19.250]  Yes, I'm the federal agent for the Justice Department, Chris Murray.
[02:20:21.090 --> 02:20:22.510]  And the judge was like, interesting.
[02:20:24.909 --> 02:20:34.870]  Now, obviously, if he was in Travis County with Judge Barbara Bellis, or I guess Barbara Bellis is up in Connecticut, Judge Guerra Gamble here in Austin, it would have been like, yeah, sure.
[02:20:35.129 --> 02:20:35.530]  Yeah.
[02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:39.190]  Hell, St. Jones barbecues babies on the White House lawn.
[02:20:39.409 --> 02:20:41.090]  Not true, but who gives a crap?
[02:20:42.010 --> 02:20:46.850]  So, here's the headline out of NBC News.
[02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:51.409]  Bankruptcy judge rejects Onion's bid to buy Alex Jones InfoWars.
[02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:57.430]  Now, he said they didn't buy it 27 days ago, but the corporate media wouldn't tell you that.
[02:20:58.090 --> 02:21:00.170]  I did, because I'm the evil person.
[02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:02.190]  And...
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:05.940]  This isn't like state courts.
[02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:08.020]  They don't have cameras and recording in federal courts.
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:12.780]  So, I had the transcript, showed them to you on air, and be like, ah, it's not true.
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:17.860]  Judge rejects sale.
[02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:18.659]  Yeah, put that back up.
[02:21:19.659 --> 02:21:20.620]  That'll never get old.
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.459]  Judge rejects sale of Alex Jones InfoWars, The Onion, in dispute over bankruptcy auction.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:28.200]  So...
[02:21:34.229 --> 02:21:45.909]  They've had two federal U.S. trustees in the last almost seven months since May 31st.
[02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:46.629]  How many months is that?
[02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:49.010]  May, June, July.
[02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:51.610]  August, September, October, November.
[02:21:51.909 --> 02:21:55.129]  Yeah, it's seven months or so.
[02:21:58.549 --> 02:22:00.290]  Just come here with armed men.
[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.239]  Armed private security to get out of the building.
[02:22:04.379 --> 02:22:05.879]  I'm up here at like 5 o'clock.
[02:22:06.639 --> 02:22:09.100]  And I start asking the security, I go, you got a warrant?
[02:22:09.219 --> 02:22:09.719]  They go, no.
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:11.340]  Let me call your boss up.
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:17.819]  Hey, well, I'm being told by a federal agent, this woman says she's a federal trustee, that you're supposed to be out of the building.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:22.379]  I said, have you ever heard of the feds having private security throw anybody out of the building?
[02:22:23.799 --> 02:22:24.920]  No, we haven't.
[02:22:25.579 --> 02:22:31.500]  Have you ever heard of people getting thrown out of buildings without a warrant or without a court order?
[02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:32.280]  No, we haven't.
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:37.899]  Well, we weren't supposed to get everybody out until 9 o'clock tonight.
[02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:41.399]  I said, yeah, I know, but I noticed people showing up here, so I went and talked to them.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:50.600]  So you better call this little lady and her lawyer and tell her that I'm going to call the police.
[02:22:51.639 --> 02:22:53.860]  And say there are people here hijacking us.
[02:22:57.239 --> 02:22:58.840]  Head of the security company calls back.
[02:23:00.139 --> 02:23:07.879]  Yeah, I mean, but they're saying they're lawyers and there's a Fed, a federal, I mean, you know, I don't think I'm going to do what they said.
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:08.399]  I said, yeah.
[02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:15.600]  Then I slept up here and I went on air and told everybody, come on, Jones, that's not going on.
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:18.700]  Then they run to the court and say, we want him out of the building.
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:19.700]  The judge says, you can't do that.
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:21.420]  We'll have a hearing in two weeks.
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:23.700]  Status quo, Jones, no.
[02:23:23.899 --> 02:23:26.020]  And then he gets rid of them.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:32.920]  And then he puts this new guy in because the feds can come into a bankruptcy case when they want.
[02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:36.340]  I mean, I've been deposed a bunch.
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.700]  I mean, they said this only happens like in Enron.
[02:23:40.219 --> 02:23:44.940]  And they'll have one or two feds there the whole time while these other lawyers...
[02:23:45.819 --> 02:23:54.340]  The Democratic Party, founded by Michael Bloomberg, and they hold up U.S. code to me, and they say, if you tell anything not true, we're going to charge you with federal crimes.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:56.579]  And I'm like, well, that's nice.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:06.899]  Well, I have accountants in mainline firms, and I, you know, and so whatever.
[02:24:07.299 --> 02:24:08.500]  I'm talking about accountants.
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.180]  I mean, I don't really even handle stuff around here.
[02:24:10.819 --> 02:24:11.739]  And they went to the judge.
[02:24:11.799 --> 02:24:13.819]  They said, we know he's got hundreds of millions in it.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.860]  And I'm sitting there going through my schedules with them.
[02:24:16.959 --> 02:24:17.760]  This was like a year and a half ago.
[02:24:17.819 --> 02:24:21.500]  And they're like, I got $500,000 in the bank.
[02:24:21.879 --> 02:24:22.200]  Gone.
[02:24:22.639 --> 02:24:23.600]  And I got this.
[02:24:24.559 --> 02:24:27.420]  And they're just literally like, and where's this money?
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:29.620]  Where's this $2.8 million?
[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:34.440]  And they just bluffed me and I said, I don't have that.
[02:24:34.719 --> 02:24:35.579]  What are you talking about?
[02:24:36.159 --> 02:24:38.299]  They go, Mr. Jones, you're going to be going to prison for this.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.840]  And my lawyers, during the break, they go, where's the money?
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.420]  And I said, there's not.
[02:24:43.559 --> 02:24:44.559]  I don't know what they're talking about.
[02:24:45.819 --> 02:24:46.940]  And it was just made up.
[02:24:47.239 --> 02:24:48.239]  Just made up.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:49.680]  But I was completely calm.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:51.280]  I was just like, whatever, you're going to set me up?
[02:24:51.319 --> 02:24:51.879]  Go ahead and do it.
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:58.459]  I mean, I am freaking Ward Cleaver when it comes to money.
[02:24:58.579 --> 02:25:00.020]  I mean, that's not even my issue.
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.319]  But see, these people think we're like them.
[02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:10.020]  That's their real problem.
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:12.520]  And thank God I'm not.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:16.159]  And I have told everyone my sins on air.
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:18.399]  People ask, why the hell do you do that?
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.180]  Because I want you to know I'm a sinner just like you.
[02:25:20.479 --> 02:25:26.659]  But I also want you to know when I tell you and you've seen me on the air 30 years that I'm doing this, I'm doing that, you can bet that's what's going on.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.219]  That's why I told you I've killed, I don't know, six, seven, eight of my children.
[02:25:30.479 --> 02:25:32.879]  Had them cut up and thrown in a garbage can.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.840]  And I have nightmares about it.
[02:25:34.879 --> 02:25:35.479]  I repented of it.
[02:25:35.559 --> 02:25:37.920]  I haven't done it since I was like 18 years old.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:40.559]  And, you know, that's what I've done.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.840]  I've murdered my children.
[02:25:43.409 --> 02:25:47.510]  And I know anybody can repent and be reproved, and God will forgive you.
[02:25:47.850 --> 02:25:48.690]  God loves me.
[02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:49.969]  Holy Spirit, boom.
[02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:52.129]  When God doesn't like something I'm doing, I feel it.
[02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:56.149]  So I have a personal relationship with the creator of the universe.
[02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:58.530]  I'm directly connected to it, as all living things are.
[02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:01.190]  So that's my boss.
[02:26:01.809 --> 02:26:03.030]  And I've done other stuff.
[02:26:03.129 --> 02:26:04.209]  I beat people's brains out.
[02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:07.729]  They started it, I still, once they hit the ground, went ahead and stomped the head a few times.
[02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:08.690]  Shouldn't have done that.
[02:26:13.770 --> 02:26:18.489]  But I've told you my sins because I want to be honest with you.
[02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:20.209]  And then I'll tell you this.
[02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:23.430]  Not a damn thing they've said I've done have I done.
[02:26:25.049 --> 02:26:30.790]  Everything they say is a freaking lie wrapped in 18 other lies with a bunch of vomit on it.
[02:26:32.229 --> 02:26:35.170]  And the world's waking up to these people.
[02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:42.709]  And so they don't have free reign and a blank check and open season on good people anymore.
[02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:50.500]  And you say, well, you don't even know how many kids you killed.
[02:26:50.659 --> 02:26:51.799]  I know of six.
[02:26:51.979 --> 02:26:53.879]  I'm guessing there were other women that had abortions.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:05.719]  The point is, is that if somebody that murdered their children, and I didn't understand it, and I didn't consciously think it, and I was going along with whatever people thought was normal, but God touched my heart and said, that is evil.
[02:27:05.719 --> 02:27:06.700]  That is wrong.
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:09.959]  And God said, here, let me just, let me pull my spirit back.
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:11.719]  Let me experience some evil.
[02:27:13.559 --> 02:27:14.219]  How's that feel?
[02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:24.959]  Now, you are going to work for me if you don't want to spend eternity with this.
[02:27:26.079 --> 02:27:28.219]  And I said, where do I sign up?
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:30.760]  And it's not like I started telling you this story.
[02:27:31.459 --> 02:27:34.600]  Today, I've been telling you this for 25 years.
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:40.479]  And I added to it that God said, I'm going to raise you up to expose the new world order.
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:43.100]  And you're going to get persecuted and attacked.
[02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:49.530]  And it's going to be horrible, but it will have spectacular success for the children.
[02:27:54.909 --> 02:27:57.370]  And this is your mission should you choose to accept it.
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:01.239]  Basically like a Mission Impossible, but cooler.
[02:28:01.819 --> 02:28:03.659]  Now, God's real, folks.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:06.559]  And I told you that 25 years ago on some local radio stations.
[02:28:06.659 --> 02:28:07.959]  People thought, this is...
[02:28:07.959 --> 02:28:11.719]  The point is, is that...
[02:28:11.719 --> 02:28:14.840]  And it wasn't in my head, because God would do things.
[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:16.520]  And I've shown you this on air.
[02:28:19.899 --> 02:28:20.620]  Get up.
[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.979]  Go in the kitchen.
[02:28:23.819 --> 02:28:25.180]  Look at the microwave clock.
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:27.159]  Okay?
[02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:29.989]  You've already done this 100 times the last few years.
[02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.750]  I'll do what you say.
[02:28:31.489 --> 02:28:32.729]  It'll be 2.27.
[02:28:33.209 --> 02:28:36.829]  Get up, go to the bathroom, turn your phone on.
[02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:38.090]  It's 4 a.m.
[02:28:38.149 --> 02:28:38.530]  Hurry up.
[02:28:39.850 --> 02:28:44.270]  And okay, just so you think that's lucky, countdown from 15 seconds.
[02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:51.950]  It'll flip on the atomic clock at 4.01 in 13, 12, 11, 10, and bloop.
[02:28:53.899 --> 02:28:54.780]  401, right?
[02:28:55.059 --> 02:28:57.739]  The point is, and I've done it on air, I've shown you.
[02:28:58.139 --> 02:28:59.959]  So God's real, folks.
[02:29:01.959 --> 02:29:05.459]  And if God will do stuff to me like that to go, hey, I'm really real.
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:12.540]  Like, I mean, I liken it to like in Interstellar, you know, where it's like that.
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.059]  And everybody else is experiencing this.
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:16.100]  We are spiritual beings.
[02:29:16.239 --> 02:29:16.860]  That's what's important.
[02:29:17.079 --> 02:29:24.059]  Don't be afraid of these Satanists that try to threaten your life or your treasure or your name to make you get in line with them and their whole social credit score.
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:24.860]  Resist them.
[02:29:24.959 --> 02:29:25.620]  Stand up against them.
[02:29:28.109 --> 02:29:30.829]  I've got a lot to say, but I want to talk about God at moments like this.
[02:29:30.909 --> 02:29:33.649]  Because this isn't about, oh, we had a victory and the judge did the right thing.
[02:29:33.709 --> 02:29:35.590]  And, oh, we got you, Bloomberg.
[02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:36.909]  We got you, Democrats.
[02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:39.270]  I mean, they've already gotten themselves.
[02:29:39.989 --> 02:29:41.909]  We don't fight them because we hate them.
[02:29:41.989 --> 02:29:44.010]  We fight them because they're coming after the innocents.
[02:29:44.149 --> 02:29:47.229]  We fight because we love those behind us that we're fighting for.
[02:29:48.409 --> 02:29:49.590]  But I love this crew.
[02:29:50.149 --> 02:29:52.170]  I don't think I've ever hugged Owen and he's been here.
[02:29:53.609 --> 02:29:59.629]  Since 2016, I got a little hug from him, and I was like, no, I'm getting a big one, because this is a big deal.
[02:30:00.350 --> 02:30:00.969]  I'm telling you.
[02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:02.030]  You said it after that.
[02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:04.809]  There's no hugging in the trenches, Alex, but, you know, we had a moment.
[02:30:05.909 --> 02:30:07.370]  How the hell did they get video of that?
[02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:09.969]  Boy, those guys, I wasn't doing that.
[02:30:10.069 --> 02:30:11.090]  I know I was doing that on camera.
[02:30:12.129 --> 02:30:13.129]  You guys are ridiculous.
[02:30:13.770 --> 02:30:15.950]  And some of this crew's been up here since 6 a.m.
[02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:17.229]  They got hidden cameras around here.
[02:30:17.229 --> 02:30:20.329]  So listen, I need to settle down and later do a statement.
[02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:24.489]  And because, you know, for the record, the media doesn't know what's coming next.
[02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:25.309]  I can tell you.
[02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:27.270]  But what do you make of this?
[02:30:27.370 --> 02:30:28.729]  Is this all the craziness?
[02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:29.549]  How crazy is this?
[02:30:30.030 --> 02:30:32.790]  Well, it's hard to even fathom, really.
[02:30:33.329 --> 02:30:34.750]  It's hard to even put into words.
[02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:37.209]  I think at this point, with all the ups and downs...
[02:30:38.159 --> 02:30:45.040]  On this epic rollercoaster ride that has been the latest chapters in the Infowar saga, I think it speaks for itself.
[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:49.000]  Three times in seven months that we've come right to almost being shut down.
[02:30:50.229 --> 02:31:04.950]  What is even harder that I think you try to vocalize here, you try to explain to the audience, and this is to the haters that are listening in, reeling right now, that we're still on air, and the fans of Infowars that have been here for a couple months, couple years, decades even.
[02:31:06.069 --> 02:31:12.170]  It's hard to put into words what it's like being in a rigged courtroom.
[02:31:12.450 --> 02:31:15.950]  It's only something you can experience for yourself.
[02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:21.790]  And when you're on the wrong side of that triangle, It's an empty feeling.
[02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:22.930]  It's a lonely feeling.
[02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:24.790]  It's a hopeless feeling.
[02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:27.170]  Because that's where you're supposed to have justice.
[02:31:27.309 --> 02:31:29.870]  I mean, that's like the final line in the sand for this country.
[02:31:29.950 --> 02:31:32.829]  And the bad guys, when it's bad guys, they're laughing.
[02:31:32.829 --> 02:31:33.309]  They know.
[02:31:33.409 --> 02:31:34.209]  They think it's funny.
[02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:36.049]  They think injustice is cute.
[02:31:36.290 --> 02:31:37.329]  Well, that's why...
[02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:48.860]  They've all been celebrating and anticipating the demise of Alex Jones because when they saw the rulings, $3.75 trillion is what Alex Jones owes.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.459]  It was 2.76, yeah.
[02:31:50.579 --> 02:31:53.239]  So these are outrageous, ludicrous speed.
[02:31:53.239 --> 02:31:57.299]  It's like space balls, just ludicrous speed and made-up stuff.
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:59.280]  So that's like chum in the water for these people.
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:04.280]  That's like chum in the water for corrupt officials and lawyers and bureaucrats and judges.
[02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:07.540]  This is the X and Y's chromosomes don't exist of law.
[02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:14.309]  And so they all feel like, oh, it's like you were saying, they all feel like, oh, well, the rules don't apply to Alex Jones.
[02:32:14.690 --> 02:32:17.469]  We can do whatever we want to Alex Jones.
[02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:19.790]  And so that's the approach they take to this.
[02:32:19.909 --> 02:32:24.430]  And then you run into a speed bump when you find out, well, you know what, maybe not everybody's corrupt.
[02:32:25.129 --> 02:32:29.590]  Maybe not everybody believes you can just do whatever you want to Alex Jones.
[02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:36.870]  And of course the irony of all of this, I've said it before, but the irony of all of this is how much you've actually been defamed.
[02:32:37.690 --> 02:32:45.889]  The crimes that have been committed against you and the character assassination and the slander and the libel, it's the great irony of this story.
[02:32:46.719 --> 02:32:47.659]  But that's what it's like.
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:49.780]  It's like, oh gee, it's open season on Alex Jones.
[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:51.319]  And the same thing happens to me.
[02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:56.040]  It's like one person follows a lawsuit, it makes the press, and then five new lawsuits come in within a week.
[02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:58.000]  It's just like chum in the water for sharks.
[02:32:58.399 --> 02:33:00.780]  And so that's how authoritarians operate.
[02:33:00.899 --> 02:33:02.020]  That's how tyrants operate.
[02:33:02.219 --> 02:33:03.739]  But you know, Alex, the one thing...
[02:33:03.739 --> 02:33:05.059]  It's how bullies operate.
[02:33:05.819 --> 02:33:06.879]  And you've never given up.
[02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:07.799]  You never give up.
[02:33:07.899 --> 02:33:09.340]  This crew has never given up.
[02:33:09.559 --> 02:33:16.100]  And, you know, here's the one thing that I'll just say when they talk about these numbers that they go into your bank accounts looking for everything.
[02:33:16.299 --> 02:33:19.940]  And, by the way, they've given a proctology exam to, like, everybody here, okay?
[02:33:20.079 --> 02:33:23.719]  I mean, there's not even a cunt hair that they have been able to find here.
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:26.659]  They've offered people money to say we did stuff to them?
[02:33:27.459 --> 02:33:27.819]  So...
[02:33:27.819 --> 02:33:30.459]  I mean, any woman we know, they call up an offer of money.
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:33.959]  The women call up and go, yeah, they're offering me 50 grand to say you did something to me.
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:36.079]  And I told him, fuck off.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.659]  But I mean...
[02:33:37.659 --> 02:33:41.139]  Well, you've been blessed by being around trustworthy people.
[02:33:41.239 --> 02:33:42.959]  In fact, you can't put a price on that, really.
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:48.219]  It's the most valuable thing in the world is trustworthiness and being around people you can trust.
[02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:52.840]  But when they come after you, you know, there's something that maybe you should explain here, Alex.
[02:33:52.879 --> 02:33:54.299]  And I know you don't like to really talk business.
[02:33:54.299 --> 02:33:55.500]  You have people that handle your business.
[02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:57.600]  But it's kind of just basic common sense stuff.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:02.719]  Yeah, you have had a successful supplement company.
[02:34:03.309 --> 02:34:09.049]  And most supplement companies do well financially because the purpose of the supplement company is to make money.
[02:34:09.229 --> 02:34:13.510]  The purpose of your supplement company is to fund something else.
[02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:16.870]  So it's like the profit isn't just profit.
[02:34:17.010 --> 02:34:19.270]  It goes into this media operation.
[02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:20.729]  It goes into the great crew.
[02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:21.690]  It's war bonds.
[02:34:21.719 --> 02:34:23.739]  The lawsuits, everything else that we fought.
[02:34:23.879 --> 02:34:28.420]  So yeah, if you just ran a supplement company with those numbers, then you might have a lot more money.
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:31.620]  You fund this operation with the supplement sales.
[02:34:31.959 --> 02:34:34.799]  That's how it's able to be an independent media operation.
[02:34:34.959 --> 02:34:39.659]  And I don't know if it's worth explaining that, but I really think that, Alex, people just don't get it.
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:41.000]  They really don't get it.
[02:34:41.059 --> 02:34:43.440]  When you talk about this stuff like, hey, I don't have all this money.
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:47.540]  When you talk about this stuff like, hey, they were engaged in corruption in these court procedures.
[02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:50.530]  It's hard for people to even believe until they've actually seen it.
[02:34:50.649 --> 02:34:51.209]  I've seen it.
[02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.870]  I've been here.
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:52.629]  It's happened to me.
[02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:53.889]  It's very real.
[02:34:54.069 --> 02:34:59.010]  Quite frankly, you kind of anticipate it when you go up against these bullies and the corrupt establishment and government.
[02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:01.430]  But here we are.
[02:35:01.530 --> 02:35:02.350]  It's very savory.
[02:35:02.549 --> 02:35:03.389]  I can't even...
[02:35:03.389 --> 02:35:06.469]  It's like the smoothest cigar you've ever smoked.
[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:08.270]  Maybe held underwater and finally getting there.
[02:35:08.370 --> 02:35:10.569]  It's like the juiciest peach you've ever bitten into.
[02:35:10.770 --> 02:35:11.670]  Best piece of ass.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:13.360]  You read my mind.
[02:35:13.459 --> 02:35:14.340]  I wasn't going to say it.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:15.379]  I'm glad you said that.
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:16.979]  Hey, but here's the bottom line.
[02:35:17.579 --> 02:35:19.879]  Supplements are the second fastest growing industry.
[02:35:20.079 --> 02:35:25.500]  They've been the fastest for like 30 years until AI. Why are they the fastest growing?
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.579]  Where does pharmakia come from?
[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:29.639]  Where do drugs come from?
[02:35:29.719 --> 02:35:34.739]  It used to all be plants and fungus and different herbs.
[02:35:36.209 --> 02:35:37.649]  That's because it works.
[02:35:38.209 --> 02:35:42.049]  That's why people buy them, because they work.
[02:35:43.649 --> 02:35:49.350]  And so we want to sell you supplements that really work, so you want to get them again.
[02:35:49.430 --> 02:35:52.209]  It'd be like a restaurant that serves dog shit.
[02:35:52.270 --> 02:35:53.770]  No one's ever going to go there.
[02:35:54.489 --> 02:35:57.129]  But meanwhile, what's the most probable thing on Amazon?
[02:35:57.409 --> 02:35:58.090]  Still, supplements.
[02:35:58.350 --> 02:36:00.430]  What's the most probable thing at the major grocery stores?
[02:36:00.569 --> 02:36:00.870]  Supplements.
[02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:03.690]  Because they work.
[02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:09.069]  That's why you go to Whole Foods and there's 10 frickin' aisles of it.
[02:36:11.290 --> 02:36:14.209]  I mean, oh, he sells unapproved supplements.
[02:36:14.569 --> 02:36:20.370]  The FDA under the 1996 GRAS Act has no jurisdiction over them.
[02:36:20.729 --> 02:36:25.770]  The only way they come after you is when you make drug claims in the drug pantheon.
[02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:26.809]  The public doesn't know that.
[02:36:26.909 --> 02:36:30.170]  The media is like, Jones sells unapproved by the FDA supplements.
[02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:31.309]  They're saying unapproved drugs.
[02:36:31.809 --> 02:36:33.549]  What, I sell concentrated turmeric?
[02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:38.389]  What, I sell atomic iodine that nobody else ever thought and everybody copies it?
[02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:44.209]  All that means is pure, folks, on the atomic chart, on the periodic table.
[02:36:44.329 --> 02:36:46.989]  The point is, is that...
[02:36:46.989 --> 02:36:49.049]  I mean, you're right.
[02:36:49.090 --> 02:36:49.930]  That's another thing they do.
[02:36:50.149 --> 02:36:51.209]  It's ridiculous.
[02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:55.469]  Well, the FDA will approve poisons that they put in children's food.
[02:36:55.950 --> 02:37:01.110]  You know, a guest, actually, when I first started listening to Infowars, it wasn't even really for political reasons, it was for the health reasons.
[02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:03.370]  You used to have a guest on all the time, Vani Hari.
[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:11.350]  There's over 50,000 chemicals that are grandfathered in that are all highly addictive, a lot of poisons that they put in the food, on purpose.
[02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:17.479]  You know, Vani Hari, the food babe who used to have here all the time, she's having a lot of victories right now.
[02:37:17.659 --> 02:37:20.459]  She's a big part of the Make America Healthy Again movement as well.
[02:37:20.639 --> 02:37:22.920]  We're having a lot of big strides in that movement.
[02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:23.860]  Yeah, why should she be on?
[02:37:23.979 --> 02:37:24.520]  I want to get her on.
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:25.559]  We should get her on.
[02:37:25.639 --> 02:37:27.620]  She's back on X. They finally gave her a count back.
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:32.459]  Maybe she'll come back on with you and talk about the boycott over Kellogg's that they've made so successful.
[02:37:32.719 --> 02:37:34.340]  But see, that's what's frustrating.
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.719]  People don't have to agree with you.
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:36.680]  They don't even have to like you.
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:38.879]  The things you're fighting for are common sense.
[02:37:38.879 --> 02:37:40.459]  They benefit everybody.
[02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:42.909]  That's poisonous and an amphetamine in the food.
[02:37:43.069 --> 02:37:44.969]  Because they want your kids addicted to it.
[02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:48.290]  And they want them to then be unhealthy, so they have to go to the doctor.
[02:37:48.450 --> 02:37:51.930]  When I was a little kid, my dad would go to the grocery shop maybe once a month.
[02:37:51.989 --> 02:37:52.969]  My mom did it like twice a week.
[02:37:53.049 --> 02:37:58.530]  But sometimes she'd be out of town visiting her mom or something, or her parents, and my dad would say, come on, let's go to the store.
[02:37:58.870 --> 02:38:02.670]  And he was not even a health nut, but he was a physician.
[02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:05.690]  And Owen, I would want Fruit Loops or something.
[02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:07.129]  And he'd say, let me see that.
[02:38:07.229 --> 02:38:08.809]  That's got red dye number five or seven.
[02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:09.469]  No, that's...
[02:38:09.959 --> 02:38:13.700]  That's from beetle shells and it's toxic and it's got to form an amphetamine to addict you.
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:15.680]  The cigarette maker companies actually own this.
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:16.399]  They're not buying that.
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.000]  He knew that.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.319]  That's how your dad talks, too.
[02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:21.459]  He knew that 40 years ago.
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:23.360]  Well, it was obvious.
[02:38:23.899 --> 02:38:37.219]  The FDA, before it got compromised by all the people in the Venn diagram that work for the pharmaceutical companies, big agriculture, and then they work at the FDA, they actually used to try to keep stuff like that out.
[02:38:37.459 --> 02:38:41.520]  They actually used to try to, hey, if we're going to improve these foods, let's keep the poisons out.
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:49.219]  That's why if you go to Europe, even Canada, you buy some of these mainstream food products, these big bag products, they have completely different ingredients.
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:50.200]  Well, here's an example.
[02:38:51.940 --> 02:39:00.600]  I'll be on a road trip, never do it now, and just be totally hungry, and I'm in the middle of nowhere, and there is a McDonald's or Burger King.
[02:39:01.079 --> 02:39:05.059]  I haven't done this like in five years, so I'll go, screw it with the crew, you've been there, down at the border or something.
[02:39:05.299 --> 02:39:10.899]  I go and get a Big Mac, and I literally feel sick two hours later, like kind of high and ugh, like it's a hangover.
[02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:12.370]  And you're hungry right away.
[02:39:12.489 --> 02:39:15.129]  It's got literally like 40-something chemicals in a Big Mac.
[02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:16.450]  You can look at each hamburger, what they got.
[02:39:16.850 --> 02:39:19.569]  But I go to Pete Terry's, and the owners are listening, by the way.
[02:39:19.629 --> 02:39:20.129]  I don't get in trouble.
[02:39:20.409 --> 02:39:22.069]  Big chain started here in Austin.
[02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:24.469]  It's all organic.
[02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:26.489]  It's all no chemical beef, all that.
[02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:28.989]  I still eat that, even though I'm in better shape, like once a week.
[02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:30.229]  Never feel bad.
[02:39:30.229 --> 02:39:30.809]  It's simple.
[02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:34.329]  You eat something and feel like crap an hour later, it ain't good for you.
[02:39:34.969 --> 02:39:36.629]  You can still eat a hamburger, folks.
[02:39:36.729 --> 02:39:40.989]  Just don't eat one from literally Bill Gates' part owner of McDonald's.
[02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:44.290]  Well, all the fries, don't they come from the Bill Gates GMO farms?
[02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:45.450]  They do.
[02:39:45.549 --> 02:39:46.450]  I mean, it's not even fries.
[02:39:46.450 --> 02:39:47.409]  It's a whole bunch of crap.
[02:39:47.930 --> 02:39:48.250]  Oh.
[02:39:48.569 --> 02:39:49.889]  It's not like sliced potatoes.
[02:39:50.049 --> 02:39:51.229]  They screwed those out.
[02:39:52.129 --> 02:39:52.430]  Hmm.
[02:39:52.829 --> 02:39:53.469]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:57.750]  I mean, the only fast food I will eat, funny enough, is I'll have a Pete Terry's burger every once in a while.
[02:39:57.930 --> 02:39:59.409]  But you can tell it's actual beef.
[02:39:59.569 --> 02:40:00.389]  You can taste it.
[02:40:00.430 --> 02:40:01.069]  100% organic.
[02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:02.590]  I think it's grass-fed, too.
[02:40:03.450 --> 02:40:04.829]  But see, young people don't know...
[02:40:05.850 --> 02:40:08.090]  Like, McDonald's changed in like the mid-80s.
[02:40:08.209 --> 02:40:10.729]  When I was a kid, McDonald's tasted just like Peter's.
[02:40:10.770 --> 02:40:11.889]  Well, they used beef tallow.
[02:40:11.989 --> 02:40:12.409]  It was dripping.
[02:40:12.549 --> 02:40:12.950]  It was delicious.
[02:40:13.129 --> 02:40:13.209]  Yeah.
[02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.950]  Kids don't even know.
[02:40:15.069 --> 02:40:15.969]  It's like space food.
[02:40:16.290 --> 02:40:17.930]  They never ate a real hamburger.
[02:40:18.250 --> 02:40:18.649]  Yeah.
[02:40:19.250 --> 02:40:20.469]  You know, unless mama made it.
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:30.319]  We're good to go.
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:44.260]  There's something in the lighting, the camera work, the writing, everything.
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:47.500]  Shows from the 90s, early 2000s, it was like uplifting.
[02:40:47.879 --> 02:40:49.079]  It was unifying.
[02:40:49.079 --> 02:40:50.120]  It was positive.
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:51.139]  Everybody was happy.
[02:40:51.319 --> 02:40:52.319]  The colors were bright.
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:53.920]  It was like, oh, it made you feel good.
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:56.260]  And now the shows that they put out.
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:56.520]  Dark.
[02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:58.620]  Dark, depressing.
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:40:59.840]  Listen to this.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.319]  I got invited like six, seven years ago to the Sundance Film Festival by a big filmmaker.
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:06.600]  And I said, I can't go.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:08.840]  But I said, I'm going to send my cousin and one of the other crew members.
[02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:16.549]  And they come back and they go, man, we were in these meetings with people, you know, because they were having all these breakaway meetings, and they were like, oh, it was unlimited money, it's just got to be dark and depressing.
[02:41:17.569 --> 02:41:19.209]  And they said, why?
[02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:23.790]  And they said, well, because we want to make everybody depressed because of Trump.
[02:41:24.209 --> 02:41:25.850]  But that was just the agenda to get the left to do that.
[02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:27.829]  No, they want us all depressed and demoralized, period.
[02:41:28.750 --> 02:41:30.409]  So you get so depressed, you don't...
[02:41:30.409 --> 02:41:32.610]  And look at leftists, what a cult they're in.
[02:41:32.690 --> 02:41:33.709]  In fact, I want to play...
[02:41:33.709 --> 02:41:38.649]  We played the AI video of the globalist death cult today, but it had a bunch of cussing on it.
[02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:40.090]  Do we have the bleep version of that?
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.059]  Alright, now I'm getting up at 5.30 in the morning, and I gotta go work out.
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:49.920]  So, but I want to be able to finish up, Owen.
[02:41:49.940 --> 02:41:52.260]  I want you to have the floor to talk about InfoWars, this victory.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:54.620]  I'm so, I'm not even tired.
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:56.540]  I'm just punch drunk from being so tired.
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.280]  You don't feel tired, but I'm super tired.
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:02.579]  I want to give you the floor for 5-10 minutes to talk about InfoWars, the show, where we're going.
[02:42:02.979 --> 02:42:04.540]  I know the breaks.
[02:42:04.719 --> 02:42:05.600]  I can pool.
[02:42:06.819 --> 02:42:11.879]  What the different angles are here of what's about to come next in Infowars.
[02:42:12.930 --> 02:42:15.190]  And so I want to come here and give people a first look.
[02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:18.329]  I want to respond to the bad guys and just do a serious announcement on what just happened.
[02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:21.170]  Because that's press worthy and the public wants to know.
[02:42:21.489 --> 02:42:24.969]  I'm very flattered about the people that have tuned in so long tonight to watch this verdict.
[02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:26.809]  The judge had said it was going long.
[02:42:26.989 --> 02:42:28.969]  All of a sudden, the lawyers didn't want closing comments.
[02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:32.290]  All of a sudden, it just shut down at like 9.40.
[02:42:32.569 --> 02:42:34.149]  I went to that eye of the Tiger Club set.
[02:42:34.170 --> 02:42:34.989]  I'm coming back in five minutes.
[02:42:35.069 --> 02:42:35.270]  They come in.
[02:42:35.350 --> 02:42:36.010]  They go, no, he's ruling.
[02:42:36.329 --> 02:42:39.590]  So he listened for 20 minutes while he ruled, and it was cliffhanger.
[02:42:40.059 --> 02:42:45.319]  Because he was showing both sides, going over the code, reading all the code, backing, because he does that for appeals.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:48.420]  He's one of the most thorough guys out there, very respected.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:56.340]  And we couldn't tell what he was about to do until the end when he just excoriated them in the way he does it very calmly.
[02:42:57.719 --> 02:42:58.840]  And it was just incredible.
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:03.780]  So I want to recap my mind, kind of summon my mental energies and make some statements on this.
[02:43:03.899 --> 02:43:05.379]  But Owen, I just want to tell you, I love you guys.
[02:43:05.639 --> 02:43:06.739]  I appreciate you.
[02:43:07.819 --> 02:43:11.659]  And I told you guys back on November 14th that we weren't going down.
[02:43:14.159 --> 02:43:20.260]  What about the TV interviews that they went on TV? Oh, we're confident that we will be successful.
[02:43:20.319 --> 02:43:20.799]  Oh, I own it.
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:21.040]  No, no.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:21.680]  We own it.
[02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:22.040]  It's mine.
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:22.459]  We're confident.
[02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:23.059]  We bought it.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:23.840]  It's ours.
[02:43:24.059 --> 02:43:27.819]  And, you know, Jones is basically just panhandling and just being dramatic.
[02:43:27.819 --> 02:43:28.500]  But we own it.
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:28.899]  It's ours.
[02:43:29.159 --> 02:43:33.920]  And we're going to confuse everybody that we're him and make fun of him and make all his followers hate him.
[02:43:34.319 --> 02:43:35.280]  We're going to steal his identity.
[02:43:35.629 --> 02:43:40.629]  You know, the lack of self-awareness is actually stunning.
[02:43:40.809 --> 02:43:41.729]  It needs to be studied.
[02:43:41.909 --> 02:43:42.950]  It needs to be psyched.
[02:43:42.989 --> 02:43:43.530]  Well, the arrogance.
[02:43:43.649 --> 02:43:44.409]  They wear it like a shield.
[02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:47.149]  But I think it's beyond that, Alex.
[02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:49.909]  I think they're just so removed from reality.
[02:43:49.909 --> 02:43:55.090]  They're so removed from any self-reflection and awareness at all.
[02:43:55.979 --> 02:43:58.700]  And they think it's funny, and they think it's a game.
[02:43:58.979 --> 02:43:59.959]  Yeah, let's go to the global.
[02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.440]  What's the owner of the front group of Bloomberg?
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:03.520]  It came out in court.
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:05.940]  It was global, tetraheed, and then the war is over.
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:07.520]  Yeah, Ben Collins.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:09.700]  Let's go to Ben Collins' ex-account.
[02:44:12.299 --> 02:44:16.340]  I wonder if he's still on there saying he bought it and he owns it and everything.
[02:44:17.559 --> 02:44:18.860]  Oh, there's a statement from him.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:23.819]  We are deeply disappointed in today's decision, but the owner will continue to seek.
[02:44:23.819 --> 02:44:25.620]  You want some dramatic violin behind you?
[02:44:27.010 --> 02:44:27.549]  Do you want...
[02:44:27.549 --> 02:44:28.690]  The crew can pull up some dramatic...
[02:44:28.690 --> 02:44:32.090]  What's that famous thing they used to use for like Zales commercials at Christmas?
[02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:36.149]  No, no, it's like...
[02:44:36.149 --> 02:44:37.149]  What's that famous song?
[02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:40.350]  Yeah, yeah, whatever it is.
[02:44:40.729 --> 02:44:41.110]  It's...
[02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:42.149]  What is that song?
[02:44:43.049 --> 02:44:45.090]  Just pull up some dramatic violin, guys.
[02:44:45.409 --> 02:44:46.370]  Just give us a little...
[02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:47.350]  Let's not make fun of them.
[02:44:48.209 --> 02:44:48.969]  Oh, okay.
[02:44:50.409 --> 02:44:51.370]  Okay, Alex.
[02:44:51.709 --> 02:44:53.790]  Listen, I don't like reveling.
[02:44:53.989 --> 02:44:54.590]  It's fine.
[02:44:54.729 --> 02:44:55.409]  It's fine.
[02:44:55.569 --> 02:44:56.350]  Revel in your time.
[02:44:56.549 --> 02:44:57.790]  I'll revel for you.
[02:44:57.870 --> 02:45:01.909]  I've seen attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
[02:45:02.970 --> 02:45:06.690]  I just love watching arrogant punks get shut down.
[02:45:06.829 --> 02:45:07.170]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:07.409 --> 02:45:17.309]  Well, I mean, these guys haven't been called up in the 40-story buildings in D.C. and been offered by the richest guy in the world at the time $50 million a year to sell out.
[02:45:17.649 --> 02:45:19.950]  I mean, they think they're in the fast lane.
[02:45:20.069 --> 02:45:22.610]  They think they're kissing up in the New World Order and they're powerful.
[02:45:22.770 --> 02:45:23.629]  You're the losers.
[02:45:23.629 --> 02:45:24.629]  You're the sellouts.
[02:45:25.209 --> 02:45:26.450]  You know what I told the globalists?
[02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:28.010]  All the suits are coming.
[02:45:28.129 --> 02:45:29.149]  We're going to destroy you.
[02:45:29.629 --> 02:45:30.590]  You want a carpet of gold?
[02:45:30.690 --> 02:45:31.149]  Carpet of bombs.
[02:45:31.290 --> 02:45:32.209]  I said, I'll take the bombs.
[02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:35.750]  It was so easy to do.
[02:45:35.850 --> 02:45:36.469]  It wasn't even hard.
[02:45:38.209 --> 02:45:40.129]  I didn't even contemplate selling out.
[02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:41.670]  I was just like, what the hell?
[02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:42.229]  Yeah.
[02:45:42.489 --> 02:45:46.750]  But that's the attitude of, if they can't control you, then just blow everything up.
[02:45:47.549 --> 02:45:48.770]  Blow it all up.
[02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:50.930]  Can you feel the tides turn, though?
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:56.860]  You know, you don't want to put the cart ahead of the horse.
[02:45:57.020 --> 02:45:58.559]  This will be a day long remembered.
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.280]  It certainly feels like momentum is going in our favor.
[02:46:02.479 --> 02:46:06.219]  But again, I just go back, and whatever, it's not a personal thing.
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:07.000]  We don't know these people.
[02:46:07.079 --> 02:46:11.280]  Maybe it's personal for them and they hate us and they want to revel in ending the First Amendment.
[02:46:11.399 --> 02:46:14.959]  But it's the lack of self-awareness that amazes me.
[02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:17.389]  That it's like somehow funny.
[02:46:17.530 --> 02:46:18.729]  It's like, okay, we're going to...
[02:46:18.729 --> 02:46:20.409]  I mean, honestly, it is kind of funny.
[02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:23.250]  The global tetrahedron is shutting Infowars now.
[02:46:23.430 --> 02:46:25.129]  I mean, you know, it's like...
[02:46:25.129 --> 02:46:25.409]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:25.569 --> 02:46:26.709]  They think we're 10 years ago.
[02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:27.729]  There's a global...
[02:46:27.729 --> 02:46:28.549]  There's no global government.
[02:46:28.549 --> 02:46:29.389]  Oh, yeah, it doesn't exist.
[02:46:29.649 --> 02:46:30.790]  It's like, oh, it doesn't exist.
[02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:34.409]  So we're going to name it this and then buy Infowars because none of it really exists.
[02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:35.010]  But it's vital Bloomberg.
[02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:38.170]  But then they write stories that say the deep state is cool now.
[02:46:39.010 --> 02:46:42.469]  And then they try to shoot Donald Trump and they censor everybody they don't like.
[02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:43.649]  And it's like, but none of it exists.
[02:46:44.489 --> 02:46:52.729]  But meanwhile, Elon Musk a year ago was at the Global Government Forum, put on by the Davos Group, saying your global government's tyrannical and will fail.
[02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:56.450]  So like the world all knows it now, and they're still pretending.
[02:46:58.290 --> 02:47:02.690]  Remember, I believe it was last year, they tried to have the global pandemic treaty.
[02:47:02.969 --> 02:47:03.370]  Failed.
[02:47:03.889 --> 02:47:05.149]  Couldn't get anybody to sign it.
[02:47:05.309 --> 02:47:05.530]  Failed.
[02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:06.430]  That's the global government.
[02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:07.909]  So none of it exists, but here's all of it.
[02:47:07.989 --> 02:47:08.969]  So it becomes a story.
[02:47:09.069 --> 02:47:11.170]  It's like double satire equals truth.
[02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:14.190]  So it's like the global tetedron is buying Infowars.
[02:47:14.489 --> 02:47:17.569]  But then it's like, but the global tetedron, there is a...
[02:47:18.489 --> 02:47:19.129]  Global government.
[02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:20.290]  Like, that is a real thing.
[02:47:20.409 --> 02:47:21.190]  But, oh, it's a joke.
[02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:23.809]  But it's two jokes because it's the onion and it's the global tetetron.
[02:47:23.889 --> 02:47:24.569]  So then it becomes true.
[02:47:24.709 --> 02:47:25.909]  So what, are they going to write headlines?
[02:47:26.209 --> 02:47:27.510]  It's meant to confuse everybody.
[02:47:27.770 --> 02:47:34.590]  Are they going to write headlines like, the fluoride in the water is lowering your IQ? What is that classical song?
[02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:35.149]  It's like a violin.
[02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:37.090]  It goes, no, no, no.
[02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:38.170]  I can't do it right.
[02:47:39.739 --> 02:47:45.180]  I keep thinking of the eyes of an angel with the animals, the suffering animals, is the one I keep thinking of.
[02:47:45.459 --> 02:47:50.860]  No, it's more like, type up 1980s Zales commercial on YouTube.
[02:47:52.059 --> 02:47:53.479]  Oh man, it's driving me crazy.
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:54.600]  Oh, I can hear it.
[02:47:54.659 --> 02:47:55.040]  I hear it.
[02:47:55.159 --> 02:47:56.700]  But that's not really a depressing thing.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:00.760]  That's kind of more of like a classy dinner type thing.
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:03.079]  You've got to read Ben Collins' statement.
[02:48:03.379 --> 02:48:19.219]  I want to play the orchestral version of Imperial March.
[02:48:20.100 --> 02:48:23.500]  Just whenever you find it, start playing it, and I will read this on air.
[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:26.659]  Because, you know, the Empire does strike back.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:29.239]  So don't think we're out of the woods yet.
[02:48:29.860 --> 02:48:36.520]  What doesn't matter is we are fighting, and everybody loves it, and we're the underdogs.
[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:44.120]  And so these dumbasses don't know how human nature works, and they just sit there watching us fight and survive and fight and survive and be bloodied.
[02:48:44.239 --> 02:48:47.000]  And then we gain the crowd's love because we're with them.
[02:48:47.159 --> 02:48:49.100]  We're like real red-blooded people, Dumbo.
[02:48:50.059 --> 02:48:51.780]  In the arena, Maximus.
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:52.520]  Maximus, Joe.
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:52.719]  Yeah.
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:54.739]  All right, go ahead and roll Imperial March.
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:04.299]  We are deeply disappointed in today's decision.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:17.899]  But The Onion, Michael Bloomberg, will continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families, Democratic Party, receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured.
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:20.440]  Not Adam Lanza killed her kids.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:25.020]  I covered the internet questioning it a few times, and the horror, can you tell us what I did?
[02:49:25.079 --> 02:49:26.040]  No, it's just the horror.
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:27.500]  It's unspeakable what Jones did.
[02:49:28.639 --> 02:49:32.520]  We will also continue to seek a path towards purchasing InfoWars in the coming weeks.
[02:49:32.799 --> 02:49:36.700]  It is part of our larger mission to make a better, funnier internet.
[02:49:36.959 --> 02:49:42.520]  We're not aggressively terrorizing Alex Jones and working in giant operations to stand down for his speech.
[02:49:42.559 --> 02:49:45.719]  You're not funnier than anything the Onion has ever done in 10 years.
[02:49:45.719 --> 02:49:52.319]  Regardless of the outcome of the case, we appreciate that the court repeatedly recognized the Onion acted in good faith.
[02:49:53.139 --> 02:50:00.500]  But are disappointed that everyone was set back to the drawing board with no winner.
[02:50:00.819 --> 02:50:04.200]  And no clear path forward for any better.
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:12.780]  And for all those upset about this as we are, please know we will continue to seek moments of hope.
[02:50:13.659 --> 02:50:17.139]  Yeah, while the Democrats chop little boy's penises off.
[02:50:17.379 --> 02:50:21.819]  We are undeterred in our mission to make a funnier world.
[02:50:23.409 --> 02:50:24.690]  Dun-da-dun-da-dun.
[02:50:25.049 --> 02:50:26.510]  Alright, so...
[02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:28.250]  Yeah, and that's what I wanna...
[02:50:28.250 --> 02:50:33.209]  I mean, I know what they're gonna pull, and I know their next moves, and I'm just thinking, should I tell you their next moves?
[02:50:35.350 --> 02:50:35.790]  Um...
[02:50:35.790 --> 02:50:42.909]  Because I'm afraid this battle station will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
[02:50:43.750 --> 02:50:45.190]  Uh, so...
[02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:48.690]  You mean like they're gonna have to build a bigger battle station, Alex?
[02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:49.670]  This one wasn't big enough?
[02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:52.229]  They're gonna need a bigger boat?
[02:50:55.829 --> 02:50:56.590]  Oh my goodness.
[02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:57.430]  You're going to need a bigger boat?
[02:50:58.610 --> 02:50:58.969]  Whatever.
[02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.770]  These people are idiots.
[02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:06.209]  I mean, I told the crew, I said, no matter what happens, we win because we're on the side of right and humanity's waking up.
[02:51:06.569 --> 02:51:06.850]  All right, Owen.
[02:51:08.069 --> 02:51:08.889]  Five, ten minutes.
[02:51:10.209 --> 02:51:12.209]  Are you shooting your report here?
[02:51:12.329 --> 02:51:13.069]  Are you going to shoot it?
[02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:15.139]  On camera stationary.
[02:51:15.559 --> 02:51:16.399]  You know, I shoot my report.
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:18.059]  We're live with millions watching right now.
[02:51:18.239 --> 02:51:19.500]  But I'm since 5.30 a.m.
[02:51:21.059 --> 02:51:25.200]  And I just need to kind of splash some water on my face and just...
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:28.719]  Well, I'm saying I'll take us, you know, I'll take us to close here if you want to just go shoot your report.
[02:51:28.799 --> 02:51:31.180]  I was asking if you wanted to do it now or in this studio.
[02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:33.739]  No, I mean, to quote the great Bill Reilly, fuck it, do it live.
[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:35.459]  Fuck it.
[02:51:35.540 --> 02:51:36.040]  I'll do it.
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:37.040]  I'll do it live.
[02:51:37.219 --> 02:51:37.680]  All right, no, no, no.
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:38.139]  Go get yourself...
[02:51:38.139 --> 02:51:38.680]  I'll write it.
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:39.500]  I'll do it live.
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:40.600]  And go get yourself prepared.
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:41.159]  And welcome.
[02:51:41.219 --> 02:51:42.860]  And thank you for this evening for watching.
[02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.579]  No, I just want to...
[02:51:45.579 --> 02:51:46.840]  No, you spend a few minutes.
[02:51:47.059 --> 02:51:47.379]  I got you.
[02:51:47.479 --> 02:51:48.479]  I'll take over here.
[02:51:48.559 --> 02:51:48.959]  You get yourself ready.
[02:51:48.959 --> 02:51:50.120]  You go for like five, ten minutes.
[02:51:50.319 --> 02:51:51.579]  I'm going to come back in here.
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:52.420]  I'm going to nail it.
[02:51:53.479 --> 02:51:55.500]  Because there's a lot I'm formulating.
[02:51:55.639 --> 02:51:56.340]  A lot I'm thinking about.
[02:51:56.399 --> 02:51:59.000]  A lot I'm cogitating on.
[02:52:00.399 --> 02:52:00.719]  And...
[02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:03.889]  Well, let me just reflect on some things then.
[02:52:04.049 --> 02:52:10.510]  Let me just reflect on some recent things and some of the things going back to when I started here.
[02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:20.010]  And I guess now it's officially going to be all the way into 2025. Started in 2016, we've done three election cycles.
[02:52:20.149 --> 02:52:22.750]  I've done three election cycles, presidential election cycles here.
[02:52:22.930 --> 02:52:26.709]  We've done two midterm election cycles here.
[02:52:27.819 --> 02:52:29.940]  And it's been an incredible journey.
[02:52:30.020 --> 02:52:38.440]  And when I first made the switch from sports to politics, for those that don't know, I was in sports media, left sports media.
[02:52:39.319 --> 02:52:40.879]  And when I first made the switch...
[02:52:40.879 --> 02:52:42.579]  How many times have I lured around behind you over the years?
[02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:44.040]  Not even once.
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:45.260]  I can't recall a single time.
[02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:47.899]  I don't think it's ever happened.
[02:52:48.819 --> 02:52:54.899]  When I left sports media and I took the leap into politics, it was pretty...
[02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:56.829]  Big leap.
[02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:58.309]  You might even say a bit of a risk.
[02:52:58.610 --> 02:53:01.350]  Had my foot in the door for multiple big career options.
[02:53:02.329 --> 02:53:07.450]  When I was at that time of my career in sports media, could have paid the bills, would have had good jobs forever.
[02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:12.969]  But I decided to leave it and jump into politics.
[02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:14.690]  A lot of people thought it was a bad decision.
[02:53:14.850 --> 02:53:15.969]  They were just like, you sure about that?
[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.469]  Been working in this industry for a long time.
[02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:19.930]  You got a lot of good opportunities.
[02:53:20.049 --> 02:53:21.770]  I said, no, this is good.
[02:53:22.809 --> 02:53:29.430]  And then, you know, with all the Mystique, let's say, intrigue around InfoWars.
[02:53:29.909 --> 02:53:33.250]  Some people even furrowed their brow like, are you really sure about that?
[02:53:34.329 --> 02:53:43.549]  But to me, there was never any doubt because I knew InfoWars was probably the only place that I could go and do what I wanted to do.
[02:53:44.609 --> 02:53:46.069]  And I was right about that.
[02:53:46.350 --> 02:54:01.649]  I've been able to do what I've wanted to do here since 2016. All the different content we've done, man on the streets, protests, activism, the shows, the live shows, late night shows like this, the extended broadcast,
[02:54:02.090 --> 02:54:02.909]  the meet and greets.
[02:54:03.930 --> 02:54:07.930]  Probably wouldn't have been able to do that the way I wanted to anywhere else.
[02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:10.270]  So I know the only place that I could have ever done that was Infowars.
[02:54:10.350 --> 02:54:11.270]  And that's what it's really all about.
[02:54:12.819 --> 02:54:14.200]  InfoWars changed the game.
[02:54:14.399 --> 02:54:20.219]  It's the multimedia, multifaceted presentation on the hop, on the dime, on the go.
[02:54:21.119 --> 02:54:24.659]  Fluid, can move in any direction at any given time.
[02:54:24.899 --> 02:54:27.840]  Agile, multimedia, live streams.
[02:54:28.079 --> 02:54:42.500]  This changed the game and it put the content in the hands of the host instead of a bunch of producers and people behind the scenes and executives and ad partners and all of that stuff.
[02:54:42.639 --> 02:54:46.180]  It put the creative, it put the thought, it put everything right there.
[02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:52.489]  We're good to go.
[02:55:09.069 --> 02:55:14.329]  I'll usually find a way to reach out to the audience, open up the phone lines.
[02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:19.469]  We probably took like 30 calls or so today on the extended Infowars War Room.
[02:55:20.069 --> 02:55:25.870]  And there's really no audience that has that connection that we have here.
[02:55:25.909 --> 02:55:29.409]  And the audience is really even part of the program.
[02:55:29.409 --> 02:55:33.489]  It's not just part of the show when you call in and you talk, but it's your activism.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:36.020]  It's your support.
[02:55:36.579 --> 02:55:38.420]  Both are fully organic, by the way.
[02:55:38.579 --> 02:55:39.639]  Both are fully grassroots.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.360]  And because of that, we don't have to go get big sponsors that can control our content.
[02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:45.959]  We're funded by you.
[02:55:46.079 --> 02:55:51.000]  And then you call in and you talk to us, and you've always been very kind, very thoughtful.
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:55.120]  You pray for us, and you've been there throughout this entire journey.
[02:55:55.340 --> 02:55:58.040]  So there's nothing else like Infowars.
[02:55:58.139 --> 02:56:09.469]  And I think, really, to the management class, The technotronic bureaucrats that are reaching for this global government.
[02:56:10.729 --> 02:56:12.190]  They hate people like us.
[02:56:12.290 --> 02:56:13.350]  They hate people like you.
[02:56:13.950 --> 02:56:18.149]  Free thinkers, free actors, people that will put it all on the line for freedom.
[02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:21.290]  People that will put it all on the line for human destiny.
[02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:22.709]  They have the vision of the future.
[02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:25.629]  They see where it can go, and they see where they want it to go.
[02:56:25.930 --> 02:56:27.530]  And that's what Infowars represents.
[02:56:27.649 --> 02:56:35.000]  And there was a caller today talking about He'd never heard of InfoWars, but he kind of just talked like us with his friends at the bar, golf course.
[02:56:36.219 --> 02:56:41.639]  And his friend said, you sound like the guys over there at InfoWars.
[02:56:41.739 --> 02:56:43.719]  He said, InfoWars, never heard of InfoWars.
[02:56:43.799 --> 02:56:44.899]  He says, hey, tune into this.
[02:56:45.219 --> 02:56:47.579]  When you get home tonight, go tune into this.
[02:56:48.139 --> 02:56:48.739]  Tune into this.
[02:56:49.059 --> 02:56:50.079]  Been tuning in ever since.
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:50.739]  Why is that?
[02:56:51.979 --> 02:56:55.260]  Because you have the same instincts that we have.
[02:56:55.819 --> 02:57:02.579]  And you look at the world around you, you look at the course humanity is on, and you say, something is corrupt here.
[02:57:02.739 --> 02:57:05.159]  Something is not right.
[02:57:05.379 --> 02:57:11.299]  Something has taken humanity off its organic course of freedom and prosperity.
[02:57:12.629 --> 02:57:14.209]  And building into the future.
[02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:19.049]  Something has taken that off course in a very corrupted, demonic way.
[02:57:19.270 --> 02:57:20.569]  And we're going sideways.
[02:57:20.969 --> 02:57:24.489]  We're going sideways culturally with all of the smut.
[02:57:25.250 --> 02:57:28.950]  We're going sideways politically with all of the corruption.
[02:57:29.049 --> 02:57:35.090]  We're going sideways with our civilization and infrastructure falling apart, not building into the future.
[02:57:35.309 --> 02:57:42.329]  We're going sideways investing in war instead of building beautiful structures into the future.
[02:57:43.059 --> 02:57:44.059]  And you can just see that.
[02:57:44.139 --> 02:57:44.879]  You can just observe it.
[02:57:44.959 --> 02:57:47.760]  But how do you put it into words?
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:49.040]  How do you present it?
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:50.620]  How do you talk about it?
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:58:04.680]  So it's this kind of thing that just remains in the back of your mind, and then it just slowly but surely gets beaten out of you, beaten out of you by culture, beaten out of you by just the morass of the day-to-day, and then it just kind of sits there dormant.
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:08.920]  And then, boom, you tune into InfoWars, and it all comes rushing back to the front.
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:10.500]  And you're like, hey, that's right.
[02:58:11.590 --> 02:58:12.149]  Hey, that's right.
[02:58:12.270 --> 02:58:14.610]  Humanity shouldn't be going into global enslavement.
[02:58:15.829 --> 02:58:20.069]  America shouldn't be funding foreign countries and foreign wars and foreign citizens.
[02:58:20.629 --> 02:58:29.510]  I shouldn't go downtown and look at poor people and homeless people and struggling people, mentally insane people.
[02:58:29.610 --> 02:58:30.229]  This isn't right.
[02:58:30.229 --> 02:58:32.729]  This isn't where humanity is supposed to go.
[02:58:32.850 --> 02:58:34.010]  Something has gone wrong here.
[02:58:34.909 --> 02:58:35.690]  And then...
[02:58:36.479 --> 02:58:37.120]  You get it.
[02:58:37.219 --> 02:58:38.079]  And we talk about it.
[02:58:38.139 --> 02:58:38.819]  And we present it.
[02:58:38.879 --> 02:58:40.200]  And we show you what has gone wrong.
[02:58:40.319 --> 02:58:41.100]  We show you the agenda.
[02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:42.159]  We show you what can go right.
[02:58:42.260 --> 02:58:44.360]  And so, this is the ship turning around.
[02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:46.700]  You know, it's not going to take four years under Trump.
[02:58:46.739 --> 02:58:50.440]  And it's not just going to be a president and administration.
[02:58:50.479 --> 02:58:52.459]  It's going to take all of us to turn this ship around.
[02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:55.819]  But I do think we can enter a golden age.
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:59:00.680]  But we have to remember that the people that have fought for so long to destroy humanity.
[02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:03.280]  The people that have fought so long to...
[02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:32.020]  Why do you think Syria just fell?
[02:59:33.250 --> 02:59:49.450]  Well, that's because all the money, all the weapons that they laundered through Ukraine, they sent to their rebel groups and their terrorist groups and their CIA and their Mossad operatives in those regions to topple Assad because he wasn't siding with the Western New World Order,
[02:59:49.569 --> 02:59:50.750]  with the global government.
[02:59:50.850 --> 02:59:52.350]  You could say he was corrupt.
[02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:55.729]  Whatever you think of Assad, he was trying to run Syria.
[02:59:56.879 --> 03:00:07.079]  He didn't want to go into this new Western culture of everything's gay and trans kids and brainwash everybody and propaganda and poison the food supply and shoot them all up with vaccines.
[03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:14.659]  So they had to topple his regime and they were able to rearm the terror groups, refund the terror groups through Ukraine and they got it done.
[03:00:14.799 --> 03:00:16.100]  And they had to do all of it.
[03:00:16.219 --> 03:00:18.659]  They had to do all of it before Trump got into office.
[03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:28.879]  And so Trump's well aware of that, and I think he's just kind of telling them in a way, he's like, hey, whatever you're going to do, better do it before I get into office, because this show is done.
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:31.920]  When I come back into the White House, all of this is done.
[03:00:33.340 --> 03:00:37.100]  And really, it was very much this audience.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:43.219]  I mean, when it comes to the media, I would say it was this audience and it was Infowars that got Trump through the...
[03:00:44.780 --> 03:01:00.639]  The first round of the Republican process, the Republican primaries, when all the other conservative media was making fun of him and against him, we supported him, we got him over that hump, and then the rest was up to him, quite frankly, and now he's bigger than ever.
[03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:03.059]  But that was the impact of Infowars.
[03:01:03.239 --> 03:01:06.139]  Hillary Clinton had to come back on her revenge tour to punish us.
[03:01:06.319 --> 03:01:09.639]  The globalists had to come back on their revenge tour to punish us.
[03:01:09.719 --> 03:01:16.420]  And they have enough of these hateful little goblins running around in the system to try to gnash at us, claw at us, slit our throats, slit our wrists.
[03:01:16.559 --> 03:01:19.620]  But we got a little bit of a reprieve today.
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:21.100]  We got a little bit of a suture today.
[03:01:21.579 --> 03:01:26.459]  And we'll be on air into 2025. So hope you had that on your bingo card.
[03:01:29.370 --> 03:01:30.030]  Owen, I love you.
[03:01:30.090 --> 03:01:30.770]  I appreciate you.
[03:01:30.770 --> 03:01:34.370]  I'm going to make some final comments here tonight.
[03:01:35.229 --> 03:01:39.729]  And then I'm going to go home, get some sleep, and get back up here tomorrow and keep fighting the globalists.
[03:01:39.889 --> 03:01:40.430]  What's that, Alex?
[03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:41.069]  You're going to be here tomorrow?
[03:01:41.930 --> 03:01:42.209]  Yeah.
[03:01:42.430 --> 03:01:43.129]  You're going to be here tomorrow?
[03:01:43.290 --> 03:01:44.229]  Here at the Onion Studios.
[03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:45.770]  Oh, at the Global Tetraedron?
[03:01:46.049 --> 03:01:46.270]  Yep.
[03:01:46.450 --> 03:01:47.090]  The war is over?
[03:01:47.309 --> 03:01:47.530]  Yep.
[03:01:47.989 --> 03:01:48.250]  Wonderful.
[03:01:48.409 --> 03:01:48.950]  I'll be here too.
[03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.889]  I work for Bloomberg now.
[03:01:50.110 --> 03:01:51.510]  I think I'm going to be here tomorrow.
[03:01:52.329 --> 03:01:53.610]  I think I'll host the InfoWars.
[03:01:53.610 --> 03:01:56.129]  Oh, look, when you go to Global Tetraedron, they don't say they're InfoWars anymore.
[03:01:56.190 --> 03:01:56.829]  They just changed it.
[03:01:58.010 --> 03:01:58.290]  Oh.
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:00.459]  Oh, look, they want to put us in a cage.
[03:02:00.559 --> 03:02:01.540]  But it's just a joke, Alex.
[03:02:01.719 --> 03:02:02.680]  None of that's really going on.
[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:03.659]  It's just a joke.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:04.540]  Cheers, Alex.
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:06.719]  Yeah, they're not building a prison planet or anything.
[03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:08.120]  Major victory.
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:09.500]  The info war goes on.
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:11.940]  It was a great celebration in the trenches with you.
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:13.940]  And we'll get back into it tomorrow.
[03:02:14.159 --> 03:02:14.340]  Cheers.
[03:02:14.559 --> 03:02:15.040]  Love the audience.
[03:02:15.159 --> 03:02:15.540]  Love the crew.
[03:02:15.659 --> 03:02:16.159]  Great job, Owen.
[03:02:16.239 --> 03:02:16.520]  Thank you.
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:17.719]  War Room tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:17.979]  Central.
[03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:18.979]  All right.
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:19.860]  Look.
[03:02:24.479 --> 03:02:26.139]  I got a new favorite saying.
[03:02:26.639 --> 03:02:29.920]  That's why I love X. I love the Infowars comments.
[03:02:30.100 --> 03:02:32.440]  I love anywhere I can read what the knowledge the crowd has to say.
[03:02:32.559 --> 03:02:40.159]  If we can go to the so-called owner of the Onion, the Bloomberg front guy, we can go to his X account.
[03:02:40.319 --> 03:02:41.459]  I'd ask Chase to send this to you.
[03:02:41.459 --> 03:02:42.079]  I want to pull it up.
[03:02:42.459 --> 03:02:44.559]  It's the comments under this statement.
[03:02:47.719 --> 03:02:52.879]  And if you read the comments, there's something really special there.
[03:02:54.489 --> 03:02:55.149]  This is important.
[03:02:55.309 --> 03:02:56.270]  I thought we had this ready.
[03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:57.729]  I'm going to take a break and we'll come back and do it.
[03:02:58.290 --> 03:02:59.469]  This is what I wanted to talk about.
[03:03:00.409 --> 03:03:01.409]  I'm about to do it right now.
[03:03:01.569 --> 03:03:02.190]  I was ready.
[03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.850]  It's okay.
[03:03:03.149 --> 03:03:03.969]  I'm so tired.
[03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:05.090]  I got to get refocused.
[03:03:05.290 --> 03:03:05.989]  This is, wait a minute.
[03:03:09.149 --> 03:03:11.010]  Let's talk about what keeps us on air.
[03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:21.969]  Let's talk about the fact that, yeah, we can keep winning, like I've been telling listeners, but do you think it was cheap to have all those lawyers down there kick these globalist asses today?
[03:03:24.010 --> 03:03:24.530]  No.
[03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:36.190]  You gave Trump $3 billion and $200 million of it they spent on having poll watchers and lawyers in all the battleground counties and they stopped a lot of the fraud so he won.
[03:03:37.629 --> 03:03:39.690]  So I don't need $3 billion.
[03:03:40.750 --> 03:03:49.790]  I just need Oh my God, I would kick their ass to Mars in the legal thing if I had $10 million over the next year.
[03:03:50.049 --> 03:03:56.250]  But we can defend ourselves and beat them for, it's going to cost like $5 million.
[03:03:56.750 --> 03:03:58.229]  Now, you want to be in a war?
[03:03:59.090 --> 03:04:00.149]  You want to win?
[03:04:01.909 --> 03:04:09.409]  You got people that'll attack the enemy with the truth and never stop, and I can be on the side of the road, I'll be warning people with my voice.
[03:04:09.690 --> 03:04:10.670]  I'll never stop.
[03:04:11.889 --> 03:04:14.209]  The question is, go get some great t-shirts.
[03:04:14.370 --> 03:04:14.850]  This is a great sub.
[03:04:14.930 --> 03:04:15.930]  It's thealexinostore.com.
[03:04:16.049 --> 03:04:17.129]  Do your Christmas shopping with the Patriots.
[03:04:20.770 --> 03:04:25.149]  Now, I need to refocus again.
[03:04:25.149 --> 03:04:28.149]  I know the crew's already been up some of her 18 hours, so it's not your fault.
[03:04:28.209 --> 03:04:29.530]  I just thought I was coordinated.
[03:04:29.629 --> 03:04:30.409]  I got those clips ready.
[03:04:30.690 --> 03:04:31.850]  I just, now I'm off track.
[03:04:33.049 --> 03:04:33.950]  We're going to come back.
[03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:37.829]  Just air some of the new ads I cut today.
[03:04:39.479 --> 03:04:41.180]  And then I'm going to do it again.
[03:04:41.319 --> 03:04:43.780]  Because at this point, I'm like ready to launch.
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:45.520]  And it's not their fault that stuff wasn't ready.
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:47.840]  And when I get this tired, it's like...
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:53.100]  I got to reset the brain, the points I was going to make.
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:54.020]  Because I don't write notes.
[03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:54.819]  Rarely.
[03:04:55.770 --> 03:04:58.209]  And when I'm this tired, again, I feel great.
[03:04:58.489 --> 03:05:01.549]  I have trouble going to sleep tonight, but the brain ain't operating at full capacity.
[03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:04.690]  I'm not Donald Trump that can work 20 hours a day and still do his best speeches.
[03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:06.790]  78 years old.
[03:05:06.889 --> 03:05:07.590]  God, he's incredible.
[03:05:08.110 --> 03:05:09.969]  These interviews he's been doing are the best ever.
[03:05:10.190 --> 03:05:11.170]  I marvel at that.
[03:05:11.250 --> 03:05:11.870]  That's impressive.
[03:05:12.250 --> 03:05:12.989]  Very impressive.
[03:05:15.209 --> 03:05:17.250]  But we'll be right back in a moment.
[03:05:18.510 --> 03:05:27.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, because of your support in the last 30 years, my operation has successfully devastated the globalists.

[03:08:45.399 --> 03:08:46.940]  Resistance is victory.

[03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:08.059]  If you can hear my voice, if you can see this transmission, You are the resistance.
[03:09:08.799 --> 03:09:15.520]  We're in the final days of 2024. Humanity has struggled and come from a deep coma to awaken.
[03:09:16.139 --> 03:09:19.059]  The forces of evil are now rallying and moving against us.
[03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:23.020]  But humanity is rising.
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:25.940]  All right.
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:35.500]  The Democratic Party, the CIA, the Justice Department, funded by Bloomberg, they can do it privately.
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:54.799]  Illegally, in a conspiracy against the American people's rights and the free press, built a straw man out of me, attacked me with tens of thousands of articles, thousands, that's conservative, disinformation programs, documentaries, to demonize the idea of a populist movement.
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:10:00.819]  They were worried that I was becoming a folk hero, so they made me one for sure.
[03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:02.959]  Not about me, it's about the image.
[03:10:03.180 --> 03:10:07.940]  The people understood it, And it backfired.
[03:10:08.620 --> 03:10:10.340]  Now the enemy's extremely desperate.
[03:10:14.479 --> 03:10:16.219]  Thank you all for keeping us on air.
[03:10:16.340 --> 03:10:17.520]  You're the reason we could fight this long.
[03:10:17.639 --> 03:10:19.579]  And we've still got more battles, but we are winning the war.
[03:10:19.959 --> 03:10:21.959]  And we're winning battles every week.
[03:10:23.180 --> 03:10:27.680]  And the fight for InfoWars is seen by the bad guys like a Roman standard or capture the flag.
[03:10:27.739 --> 03:10:28.700]  If they could just get that.
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:30.760]  In wars throughout history...
[03:10:31.649 --> 03:10:36.969]  There are places where armies decide to die on the hill.
[03:10:38.530 --> 03:10:43.229]  Stalingrad is where a third of the people in World War II died.
[03:10:44.790 --> 03:10:47.329]  Estimates are of soldiers.
[03:10:49.530 --> 03:10:50.370]  10 million.
[03:11:00.010 --> 03:11:07.450]  This is an information war, but they've decided that media-wise, Infowars is the Stalingrad.
[03:11:09.909 --> 03:11:13.069]  And so, this is a big victory.
[03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:27.770]  Now, we have not completely crushed their forces at Stalingrad, but they're losing, and if we just keep fighting, they're done.
[03:11:29.949 --> 03:11:31.969]  And Infowars is the little Stalingrad.
[03:11:32.090 --> 03:11:32.809]  Trump's the big one.
[03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:38.590]  But to the enemy, it's very important.
[03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:43.870]  So the viewers and listeners need to really understand, that's not hype what I just said.
[03:11:44.049 --> 03:11:48.690]  They didn't run more propaganda against me than they normally do before they invade a country.
[03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:55.510]  Because they said, if we can beat that guy, they liken me.
[03:11:56.270 --> 03:11:57.610]  That's how the enemy sees me.
[03:11:58.649 --> 03:12:07.930]  As John the Baptist, in a Time Magazine article like 15 years ago, they went, oh, these universities and the State Department have done studies, and it's Ron Paul and Alex Jones.
[03:12:08.049 --> 03:12:12.870]  They're the one fueling the radicalization of the Tea Party, taking over the Republican Party.
[03:12:12.889 --> 03:12:17.469]  And he didn't win those two times he ran, but he built Ron Paul and you supporting him.
[03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:23.649]  The beachhead, this is recognized in mainline political science as a fact.
[03:12:23.649 --> 03:12:24.090]  It's true.
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:25.680]  I lived it.
[03:12:25.860 --> 03:12:27.459]  Many of our supporters, you were part of it.
[03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:28.020]  You lived it too.
[03:12:28.479 --> 03:12:31.940]  We built the beachhead to begin to take over the Republican Party.
[03:12:33.899 --> 03:12:36.260]  Then Trump was the main invasion force.
[03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:38.639]  The enemy tried to repulse that.
[03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:40.159]  It's been a nine-year battle there.
[03:12:40.420 --> 03:12:42.659]  Now we're winning the war.
[03:12:43.299 --> 03:12:44.600]  The main war.
[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:50.940]  We hit the beaches decades ago.
[03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:57.569]  This war will still take decades.
[03:12:59.090 --> 03:13:02.489]  And the final war will be once we remove the globalists, not becoming them.
[03:13:03.149 --> 03:13:10.829]  And that's where I intend to still be there on air and try to be as healthy as I can for those key fights 10, 15 years from now.
[03:13:12.709 --> 03:13:15.770]  Because meet the new boss, same as the old boss, won't get fooled again.
[03:13:17.370 --> 03:13:19.110]  So this is a long battle.
[03:13:19.350 --> 03:13:20.469]  This is a long war.
[03:13:20.629 --> 03:13:23.290]  And it's for winter soldiers, not sunshine patriots.
[03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:26.350]  And InfoWars is the winner's soldier.
[03:13:27.329 --> 03:13:29.709]  And all of you that supported us are the InfoWars.
[03:13:29.850 --> 03:13:31.110]  You are the winner's soldier.
[03:13:31.329 --> 03:13:34.010]  And I salute you from the bottom of my red-blooded heart.
[03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:35.909]  All right.
[03:13:36.409 --> 03:13:40.030]  I'm not going to be like the left and just run around and chortle about this because this is just a major battle.
[03:13:40.110 --> 03:13:40.870]  This is not the war.
[03:13:41.770 --> 03:13:43.290]  And we have to recognize that.
[03:13:44.329 --> 03:13:49.750]  And I don't expect, I know, that they're just going to attack even harder because they're desperate.
[03:13:50.450 --> 03:13:51.149]  And that's okay.
[03:13:51.209 --> 03:13:52.190]  I'm a big boy.
[03:13:52.430 --> 03:13:53.690]  I asked to be in the arena.
[03:13:54.569 --> 03:13:57.350]  You asked to be in the arena, so we know what we're up against.
[03:13:59.110 --> 03:14:05.530]  But there have been many times in history where people fight tyranny because it's the right thing to do and they know God's watching.
[03:14:07.409 --> 03:14:12.510]  And it's their spirit to fight it, even knowing they probably won't win or it might take generations.
[03:14:13.950 --> 03:14:25.049]  You're getting, because God knows we're the instant gratification generation, You're getting victory while you're alive.
[03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:31.790]  And that's because there's even worse stuff coming down the road.
[03:14:31.930 --> 03:14:39.190]  God wants to give us a win and build up our confidence for stuff that's going to be a lot crazier because these technologies and things are extremely dangerous.
[03:14:39.430 --> 03:14:41.129]  So we got some big challenges, okay?
[03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:44.690]  But if we have truth and justice and optimism, we can do anything.
[03:14:45.209 --> 03:14:47.049]  So I actually feel sorry for our enemies.
[03:14:48.939 --> 03:14:53.440]  It's a guilty, low-level thing of the flesh to celebrate stuff like this.
[03:14:53.559 --> 03:14:54.440]  This is not a celebration.
[03:14:55.219 --> 03:14:58.440]  Surviving on a huge globalist Bloomberg deep state attack.
[03:14:59.059 --> 03:14:59.959]  CIA attack.
[03:15:02.899 --> 03:15:08.360]  Just think of all the other people that don't have a big audience of activists that back them who could stand against this.
[03:15:09.319 --> 03:15:12.639]  Think of the kids that are brainwashed and taking from their parents and mutilating and chopping up.
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:16.079]  Think of Syria turning over to Al-Qaeda and mass death.
[03:15:16.239 --> 03:15:17.579]  I mean, there's a lot of bad stuff going on.
[03:15:18.079 --> 03:15:23.059]  And the globalists are trying to start total nuclear war and they got new viruses coming out and all of that.
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:28.559]  So, like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating just yet.
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:29.799]  Okay?
[03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:35.200]  Let's not be the cocky people like the bad guys.
[03:15:36.139 --> 03:15:48.250]  Let's be thankful to God For providing for us and hopefully we can be stewards of the power we've been given because it all comes from God.
[03:15:49.049 --> 03:15:56.750]  And the minute you start thinking you've got the power and you want power you will be destroyed or you will be enslaved or you will be overtaken.
[03:15:57.110 --> 03:16:03.469]  We're doing this because evil is taking over and we have a responsibility to fight these people.
[03:16:03.709 --> 03:16:09.829]  Now I want to show a few things from the global tetrahedron on their site.
[03:16:09.989 --> 03:16:11.530]  No longer do they say they own InfoWars.
[03:16:11.610 --> 03:16:12.989]  Now it's a cage around the earth.
[03:16:14.069 --> 03:16:18.610]  And they have such disrespect for you that they mock you when that's their Bloomberg's plan.
[03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:19.350]  The Democrats.
[03:16:19.549 --> 03:16:20.270]  I mean, that's what they're building.
[03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.850]  Look at it.
[03:16:21.209 --> 03:16:22.010]  Let's put it on screen.
[03:16:23.270 --> 03:16:34.639]  Chase posted it earlier on his X. That's their hate letter to you.
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:38.000]  Imagine being that evil and pathetic.
[03:16:40.520 --> 03:16:42.579]  I mean, that's the cashless society.
[03:16:42.719 --> 03:16:43.920]  That's the central bank digital currency.
[03:16:44.079 --> 03:16:44.959]  That's the social credit score.
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:45.860]  That's the New World Order.
[03:16:46.459 --> 03:16:54.200]  That's the 325,000 children the government knew they had and that they disappeared to the country for sex slavery and physical slave labor and the rest of it.
[03:16:54.260 --> 03:16:55.760]  It's all certified Senate reports.
[03:16:58.020 --> 03:17:00.139]  And they know you know you're under attack.
[03:17:00.319 --> 03:17:02.799]  They know and they want to mock you.
[03:17:04.559 --> 03:17:05.579]  And say, we'll get you.
[03:17:10.139 --> 03:17:13.059]  So Chase posted an hour ago and said, take this down.
[03:17:13.100 --> 03:17:13.940]  And they did.
[03:17:14.799 --> 03:17:16.459]  But they told you, hey, we'll get you.
[03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:19.760]  My pretty, we'll get you and your little dog too.
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:21.000]  We'll get your kids.
[03:17:25.139 --> 03:17:25.500]  So...
[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:28.139]  That's a little message to you.
[03:17:28.239 --> 03:17:30.219]  Because they couldn't say we're going to put you in a cage.
[03:17:30.420 --> 03:17:31.860]  People go, God, that's evil.
[03:17:32.020 --> 03:17:32.979]  These people are...
[03:17:32.979 --> 03:17:35.159]  They're like, oh, it's a cage we built for you.
[03:17:35.159 --> 03:17:36.319]  A little prison planet.
[03:17:37.860 --> 03:17:40.780]  Oh, you guys invented popularizing that political term.
[03:17:40.879 --> 03:17:41.059]  Okay.
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:42.760]  I mean, I heard of that before.
[03:17:44.239 --> 03:17:44.600]  So...
[03:17:45.649 --> 03:17:47.510]  I want to show some of the comments on there.
[03:17:47.549 --> 03:17:48.809]  And I saw this one comment.
[03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:53.370]  There's a lot more now in his little post, the so-called onion owner.
[03:17:53.610 --> 03:17:54.829]  A lot of layers of that onion.
[03:17:55.510 --> 03:18:03.950]  Bloomberg's at the bottom of it with the CIA. And under it, people say, Trevin says, wickedness isn't in style anymore.
[03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:05.950]  Perhaps it's time for you to sell shoes.
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:14.780]  And I want a t-shirt or something along those lines that says, wickedness is no longer in style.
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:16.440]  Infowars.com.
[03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:28.540]  And if they run more chicanery or more scams or God knows what, and the federal judge said, look, if you guys don't settle and don't actually try to make a real deal with Mr. Jones, he's trying to pay you money.
[03:18:31.010 --> 03:18:36.409]  And we tried to settle for, you know, 10 times, 20 times, God, what they were saying they were buying it for.
[03:18:36.629 --> 03:18:37.590]  They said they don't want money.
[03:18:38.090 --> 03:18:38.930]  And I knew that.
[03:18:39.010 --> 03:18:40.309]  I said, just let it go up to 90 million.
[03:18:40.909 --> 03:18:42.209]  Oh, they'll do that.
[03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:43.250]  No, no, that's not enough.
[03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:45.709]  We want you to say you're anti-gun and a bunch of other stuff.
[03:18:45.850 --> 03:18:48.690]  I'm like, yeah, see, I told you guys, this is, you know, CIA right here.
[03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:52.729]  Not the plaintiffs, they're just front people that are being manipulated.
[03:18:53.809 --> 03:18:57.290]  And I told everybody, it's going to be a rigged auction.
[03:18:58.930 --> 03:18:59.549]  Saw it.
[03:19:00.629 --> 03:19:05.950]  So, they're going to pull more of this.
[03:19:06.049 --> 03:19:07.030]  But that's okay.
[03:19:07.370 --> 03:19:10.430]  By engaging in the fight, we draw them out.
[03:19:11.409 --> 03:19:15.510]  So many listeners said, oh, you tell us go vote, but if there's fraud, they'll just steal it.
[03:19:15.569 --> 03:19:17.450]  And I'd had all these experts on to the math myself.
[03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:23.629]  You get a big enough landslide, there's not enough fraud baked in, not enough dead people, not enough people out of district.
[03:19:23.829 --> 03:19:26.069]  I've explained the numbers many times, but here's an example.
[03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:29.069]  If Trump got 90% of the vote, could they steal it?
[03:19:29.170 --> 03:19:30.770]  No, because the math's not there.
[03:19:30.870 --> 03:19:32.149]  If he had 70%, they can't steal it.
[03:19:32.209 --> 03:19:32.649]  That's what he got.
[03:19:34.260 --> 03:19:34.799]  In reality.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.319]  Because there's not, you know, what have you got 100%?
[03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:40.040]  Are they still that?
[03:19:40.159 --> 03:19:47.379]  No, because there's, they'd say, well, my God, if, you know, all the voters voted and he won't got every vote, well, then how do they, you can't do that.
[03:19:49.520 --> 03:19:51.750]  So, And that's what Trump said.
[03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:52.750]  He said, no, it's too big to rig.
[03:19:52.909 --> 03:19:53.909]  We had a bigger landslide.
[03:19:54.010 --> 03:19:55.850]  They tried to mitigate it, but we overdrew.
[03:19:56.090 --> 03:19:58.690]  I told you months before that was going to happen.
[03:19:59.309 --> 03:20:04.010]  Because Trump got Laura Trump in on the ground game and mitigated the fraud.
[03:20:05.260 --> 03:20:21.079]  They had the trucks pull up in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Georgia at midnight and 1am again with out-of-state plates with the boxes and the cops were standing there with the Trump lawyers who had to sue in each county to make them let them in so they couldn't do it and cover up the windows like last time.
[03:20:22.709 --> 03:20:29.729]  And then they thought they'd intimidate people and rig trials and sue people that exposed it and take what they had, that that would intimidate everybody else.
[03:20:29.790 --> 03:20:37.530]  And a month before the election, the Democrats put out a press release and said, any lawyers poll watching, which is constitutional, any lawyers in there, we're going to get you disbarred.
[03:20:37.649 --> 03:20:41.350]  Well, did the lawyers all get intimidated and not go do what they were supposed to?
[03:20:41.489 --> 03:20:41.629]  No.
[03:20:42.010 --> 03:20:47.069]  Oh, you threatened Americans and tried to intimidate them and it made more of them come out.
[03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:53.190]  See, you thought we were intimidated before, but When people weren't active, no, people were asleep.
[03:20:54.329 --> 03:21:06.290]  Now threatening people has the opposite effect because you project on the general public being bottom-feeding, servile, cowardly criminals, and you roll over to the first evil you see and start licking its ass.
[03:21:07.069 --> 03:21:08.329]  That's not good people.
[03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:13.149]  You pissed people off, dumb asses.
[03:21:14.799 --> 03:21:18.600]  And you thought you demonized and shut down Alex Jones as an example of others?
[03:21:18.799 --> 03:21:22.000]  How'd that work out for you with everybody else?
[03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:27.700]  You know that famous meme of a bunch of Alex Jones is walking out of a tunnel, saying you're in the wrong neighborhood globalist?
[03:21:28.020 --> 03:21:29.459]  That's what's happened now.
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:33.780]  And I'm so thankful to God.
[03:21:36.600 --> 03:21:38.020]  I am so honored.
[03:21:38.760 --> 03:21:43.139]  I just cannot thank God enough, and I cannot thank God for working through you out there and your support.
[03:21:43.239 --> 03:21:43.760]  It's epic.
[03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:49.110]  So, wickedness is no longer in style, dumbasses.
[03:21:53.370 --> 03:21:57.370]  You're a society of arrogant scum.
[03:22:02.350 --> 03:22:07.549]  This guy they hired as their front guy is a former disinformation expert in MSNBC. Yeah, where's your job there?
[03:22:07.569 --> 03:22:08.469]  It's all collapsing.
[03:22:09.209 --> 03:22:11.110]  You can't get people to watch you.
[03:22:11.129 --> 03:22:13.350]  Their average show has like 30,000 viewers now.
[03:22:14.370 --> 03:22:15.889]  A fart in the wind has more than that.
[03:22:16.629 --> 03:22:20.030]  I could aim a camera at drying paint at my house and have a million viewers.
[03:22:20.250 --> 03:22:22.329]  You are a joke.
[03:22:23.129 --> 03:22:24.989]  And I say that not to triumph.
[03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:27.649]  It doesn't make me feel good that you're lower than whale shit.
[03:22:27.850 --> 03:22:29.530]  It's that you are pathetic.
[03:22:30.129 --> 03:22:31.370]  Stop being that way.
[03:22:32.430 --> 03:22:33.750]  Come join Team Humanity.
[03:22:33.850 --> 03:22:34.610]  Repent to God.
[03:22:36.549 --> 03:22:40.409]  Stop kissing the ass of the most evil people on earth and thinking that gives you power.
[03:22:40.649 --> 03:22:41.389]  You're fools.
[03:22:44.430 --> 03:22:44.610]  All right.
[03:22:47.149 --> 03:22:47.510]  Look.
[03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:51.489]  I'm going to come back at 11 a.m.
[03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:53.010]  tomorrow and I'll go over it all.
[03:22:54.010 --> 03:22:59.590]  But it is really something that they said they owned it.
[03:22:59.649 --> 03:23:00.149]  They never did.
[03:23:02.149 --> 03:23:04.209]  We've been back in the building for almost a month.
[03:23:04.590 --> 03:23:06.510]  And listeners are like, sorry, we can't support you.
[03:23:06.569 --> 03:23:07.930]  We don't want to give money to the Democrats.
[03:23:08.250 --> 03:23:09.729]  We can't go to the AlexHillScore.com.
[03:23:09.870 --> 03:23:10.950]  I didn't even own that.
[03:23:11.069 --> 03:23:11.629]  It's a sponsor.
[03:23:16.219 --> 03:23:18.180]  And they damaged Infowars massively.
[03:23:18.340 --> 03:23:19.379]  They're all going to get sued for that.
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:22.680]  Almost no one's buying anything at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:23:22.780 --> 03:23:23.600]  All the great products are there.
[03:23:24.399 --> 03:23:25.920]  Because people are like, well, I don't want them to get the money.
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:26.600]  They don't own it.
[03:23:26.659 --> 03:23:27.219]  They didn't get it.
[03:23:27.280 --> 03:23:27.780]  It didn't happen.
[03:23:28.579 --> 03:23:34.280]  But by them announcing that we're gone, some people are like, oh, I see your show on.
[03:23:34.479 --> 03:23:35.540]  It looks like the same studio.
[03:23:35.680 --> 03:23:36.600]  I thought The Onion owns that.
[03:23:36.639 --> 03:23:37.319]  I'm like, no, they don't own it.
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:39.040]  Well, CNN said so.
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.120]  Yeah, CNN also says, you know, two men can have a baby.
[03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:45.450]  So now it's triple official.
[03:23:45.850 --> 03:23:49.149]  They've ignored the judge in three hearings saying, you didn't buy it, stop saying that.
[03:23:49.489 --> 03:23:51.250]  And they just keep on doing it.
[03:23:51.489 --> 03:23:52.729]  Finally tonight, they stopped.
[03:23:54.069 --> 03:23:57.389]  And I can tell them, right now, you are going to be sued.
[03:23:57.850 --> 03:23:59.530]  So preserve all your documents.
[03:24:00.209 --> 03:24:08.069]  Already I'm suing them, but I mean, unlawful conversion, property rights violation, basically you hijacked the building.
[03:24:08.770 --> 03:24:10.190]  Basically, you did.
[03:24:10.750 --> 03:24:14.920]  But The judge told you two weeks ago, you better stop doing it.
[03:24:15.459 --> 03:24:17.520]  We don't need a temporary restraining order.
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:20.139]  Obviously, their lawyers know to stop saying they own it, right?
[03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:22.860]  No, they didn't stop.
[03:24:23.979 --> 03:24:30.540]  So for the last two weeks, plus, they sat up there saying they own this place as a bluff, as a confidence game.
[03:24:31.260 --> 03:24:41.239]  And every day, you damaged this operation on purpose and laughed about it.
[03:24:42.739 --> 03:24:48.139]  While doing TV interviews saying, Alex did things so horrible to these families, we can't even tell you.
[03:24:48.379 --> 03:24:50.299]  Yeah, they can't tell you because I didn't do jack crap.
[03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:59.059]  They attached themselves to me and raised money for a victim disarmament government operation.
[03:25:00.680 --> 03:25:02.600]  And it's all coming out.
[03:25:04.979 --> 03:25:06.799]  I like it to the Mendez brothers.
[03:25:09.149 --> 03:25:12.670]  Once you find out what really happened, they're not bad, they're heroes.
[03:25:15.350 --> 03:25:17.329]  You see how the brain works?
[03:25:17.709 --> 03:25:21.090]  A lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts his pants on, as Mark Twain said.
[03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:26.270]  But once the truth comes out, nothing can stop it.
[03:25:26.930 --> 03:25:32.729]  Another Mark Twain quote is, In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[03:25:33.190 --> 03:25:39.840]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, Because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[03:25:41.840 --> 03:25:47.340]  And I welcome all the other talk show hosts and people now sounding identical to me.
[03:25:47.979 --> 03:25:49.760]  Because that's real victory.
[03:25:50.319 --> 03:25:54.819]  And I even like going on their shows and have them repeat back things word for word I said 20 years ago.
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:57.659]  And I tell them that is a fascinating thought.
[03:25:57.860 --> 03:25:58.979]  Thank you for teaching me.
[03:26:00.459 --> 03:26:05.079]  Because that's what someone does that's trying to win.
[03:26:06.049 --> 03:26:07.750]  You don't territorialize information.
[03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:16.430]  You don't keep people out of the fold because they're not an OG. We're here to find the prodigal sons and bring them home to their family.
[03:26:17.409 --> 03:26:23.870]  And so I would like to have the Onion Man on the show.
[03:26:27.069 --> 03:26:32.270]  I'd like to take him to dinner and say, you can stop being a betrayer of your species.
[03:26:32.270 --> 03:26:33.950]  You can stop serving evil.
[03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:38.370]  You can stop being part of the lie.
[03:26:39.909 --> 03:26:41.409]  I want to see you fulfilled.
[03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:49.030]  Don't you know how much everybody despises you, how pathetic you look, how fake you are?
[03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:51.989]  Don't you want to be a real person?
[03:26:53.250 --> 03:26:54.889]  A real boy like Pinocchio.
[03:26:56.290 --> 03:26:58.809]  But how does Pinocchio become a real boy?
[03:26:59.950 --> 03:27:01.370]  He has to have courage.
[03:27:03.209 --> 03:27:04.530]  He has to tell the truth.
[03:27:09.870 --> 03:27:11.370]  And then he can be a real man.
[03:27:14.069 --> 03:27:15.729]  Not a...
[03:27:15.729 --> 03:27:18.909]  servile...
[03:27:18.909 --> 03:27:21.290]  deceptive...
[03:27:21.290 --> 03:27:21.809]  puppet.
[03:27:26.809 --> 03:27:28.229]  You gotta be...
[03:27:28.229 --> 03:27:30.350]  your own man, not a puppet on a string.
[03:27:30.569 --> 03:27:33.569]  You know, it's a cheesy song, but you say it's cheesy because you love it.
[03:27:33.629 --> 03:27:34.090]  You know, it's true.
[03:27:34.409 --> 03:27:35.229]  Get aaron-tippet.
[03:27:35.309 --> 03:27:37.270]  I want to end the show with...
[03:27:41.379 --> 03:27:42.120]  What was that song?
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:43.940]  You got to stand for something or fall for anything.
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:45.459]  I want to end with that.
[03:27:46.159 --> 03:27:48.280]  Look, I'll hit all this tomorrow.
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:51.559]  This is why they want us off the air, but I'll just tell you what's here.
[03:27:52.159 --> 03:27:59.600]  Tom Homan says they're going to arrest all the Globals for child trafficking and one of their main missions is find the kidnapped kids.
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:01.459]  We've been pushing for that.
[03:28:01.579 --> 03:28:02.260]  That's going down.
[03:28:02.680 --> 03:28:05.600]  That's got the deep state really scared, but it's the right thing to do.
[03:28:05.719 --> 03:28:07.319]  We got to find the kids and then bring them all down.
[03:28:08.110 --> 03:28:09.930]  Boy, you think the Democrats are unpopular now.
[03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:10.889]  This will end them for good.
[03:28:11.229 --> 03:28:12.950]  Then we'll have another two-party system.
[03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:13.530]  It'll be a new party.
[03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:14.389]  Republicans will split in two.
[03:28:14.489 --> 03:28:17.010]  But the Democrats, you know, they're going to outlaw themselves with their actions.
[03:28:17.229 --> 03:28:18.270]  We don't even go outlaw them.
[03:28:18.350 --> 03:28:19.510]  No one will want to be anywhere near them.
[03:28:19.610 --> 03:28:19.989]  They're done.
[03:28:20.170 --> 03:28:20.469]  They're done.
[03:28:20.610 --> 03:28:21.430]  Might take a few years.
[03:28:22.250 --> 03:28:26.729]  And then the White House just sounds like this weird distributed bid.
[03:28:28.100 --> 03:28:28.700]  Madoff thing.
[03:28:28.780 --> 03:28:29.840]  They travel this fake auction.
[03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:37.860]  They're going to give $50 billion more outside of congressional money that Speaker Johnson just blocked to Ukraine to keep World War III going.
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:39.459]  We've got that.
[03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:43.959]  But get me.
[03:28:44.239 --> 03:28:45.219]  Let me know when you got it.
[03:28:45.319 --> 03:28:48.659]  Daddy didn't like trouble, but when it came around, everybody...
[03:28:50.659 --> 03:28:52.059]  Knew which side he'd be on.
[03:28:52.600 --> 03:28:57.579]  And then I will thank the crew, and I will be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:28:57.639 --> 03:28:59.360]  Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[03:28:59.379 --> 03:29:02.040]  We have survived three attempts to shut us down in seven months.
[03:29:02.360 --> 03:29:06.100]  It's the grace of God, but God working with the listeners to support us.
[03:29:06.219 --> 03:29:06.840]  And that's it.
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:10.840]  It's hard to stop when this stuff's so historic and important, but thank you all.
[03:29:12.239 --> 03:29:18.620]  Have a Merry Christmas, and unless they firebomb us or something, which, you know, You know, the loving liberals.
[03:29:18.739 --> 03:29:19.500]  I'm not saying the people here.
[03:29:19.620 --> 03:29:21.579]  No, obviously, you know, the little Antifa folks.
[03:29:22.200 --> 03:29:29.420]  Regardless, we're going to continue on, and no weapon formed against us shall prosper as long as God is with us, who can be against us.
[03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:30.860]  This is a vital transmission.
[03:29:30.860 --> 03:29:32.959]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[03:29:33.440 --> 03:29:36.940]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists, thanks to your support.
[03:29:38.959 --> 03:29:39.799]  We need to stay on air.
[03:29:39.959 --> 03:29:41.399]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[03:29:41.559 --> 03:29:45.399]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:29:45.579 --> 03:29:50.420]  And I told you, we're not just going to have patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:29:51.139 --> 03:29:54.399]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[03:29:54.500 --> 03:29:56.000]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[03:29:57.590 --> 03:30:03.829]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[03:30:04.149 --> 03:30:05.750]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[03:30:05.930 --> 03:30:09.229]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[03:30:10.209 --> 03:30:12.129]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[03:30:12.370 --> 03:30:14.270]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:21.170]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[03:30:21.649 --> 03:30:27.270]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:28.090]  That continues.
[03:30:28.270 --> 03:30:29.110]  Look at this bad boy.
[03:30:29.229 --> 03:30:31.950]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[03:30:32.129 --> 03:30:32.750]  I designed it.
[03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:39.190]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:40.670]  They are a piece of history.
[03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:42.670]  They are pure silver.
[03:30:43.090 --> 03:30:45.430]  They are minted here in America.
[03:30:46.659 --> 03:30:47.940]  2,000 of these.
[03:30:48.159 --> 03:30:50.379]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.

[03:31:02.899 --> 03:31:10.920]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
