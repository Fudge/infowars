[00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:04.870]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kamala Harris went off script yesterday.
[00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.151]  This is such an important clip you're about to see.
[00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.712]  And she said, listen, don't listen to the polls.
[00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:11.313]  Get out there and vote.
[00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.594]  We're underdogs.
[00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:15.895]  This is a really close election.
[00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:21.218]  Now, I could take hours breaking this down, but I've interviewed the top voting experts, the top polling experts.
[00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:27.240]  Remember in 2016, Hillary had a 98% chance of winning and was 15, 20 points ahead.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:42.846]  They use these fake polls they put out, commissioned by the Democratic Party, to make it sound like she's so far ahead, so Republicans give up, but also so if they steal the election, or try to steal it again, it sounds plausible when she wins.
[00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:49.049]  So they're buying all these fake Google articles that look like news articles in newspapers that aren't.
[00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.371]  They're buying all this stuff on Yahoo.
[00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:55.216]  They're flooding the zone with that garbage and buried in there.
[00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:59.020]  And also at the top of the articles, they tell you that she's 10, 20 points ahead.
[00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.663]  Okay, and then, you know, it's all over for Trump.
[00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.387]  But the betting market has Trump equal or ahead of her.
[00:01:05.988 --> 00:01:10.230]  Not Kamala ahead of him and they're usually way more accurate than the polls.
[00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.691]  So we see this over and over again.
[00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:21.294]  So now she comes out in this latest speech, goes off script, goes off teleprompter and starts talking about the fact that don't believe these polls.
[00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.495]  This race is really, really close.
[00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.496]  So this shows they're scared.
[00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:30.118]  They have a margin of dead people and illegals voting and folks out of district of about 10%.
[00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:32.978]  That's the number that most experts come up with.
[00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.260]  But if Trump is 12, 13, 14 points ahead in the battleground states, it's game over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.541]  So here's the clip of Kamala Harris for once telling the truth.
[00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:51.063]  So friends, 64 days until the most election of our lives.
[00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.313]  And probably one of the most important in the life of our nation.
[00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:57.394]  Truly.
[00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.458]  And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:06.561]  It's going to be a tight race to the very end.
[00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.783]  So let's not pay too much attention to those polls.
[00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:17.729]  Because as unions and labor knows best, we know what it's like to be the underdog.
[00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.552]  And we are the underdog in this race.
[00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:24.325]  And we have some hard work then ahead of us.
[00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.807]  But here's the beauty of us in this room.
[00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:28.649]  We like hard work!
[00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.192]  Hard work is good work!
[00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:34.555]  Hard work is joyful work!
[00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:41.483]  And so in this fight, I will continue to count on
[00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:55.276]  The strength, the determination, and the hard work of the leaders in this room to knock on doors, to get folks to the polls, and bluntly put, because the people in here do it, to help us win Pennsylvania.
[00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:03.519]  So today I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
[00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:06.929]  Do we believe in freedom?
[00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.393]  Do we believe in opportunity?
[00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:14.338]  Do we believe in the promise of America?
[00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.203]  And are we ready to fight for it?
[00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:22.408]  And when we fight, we win!
[00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:23.409]  God bless you.
[00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.631]  God bless America.
[00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.254]  But I'm gonna give you the same piece of advice Tamala just gave her constituents.
[00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:37.215]  Again, I know they've got about 10% that they can play with with fraud.
[00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:41.916]  Trump won on such a big landslide in 2016 that they were unable to steal it.
[00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:50.959]  But people got overconfident with all the Q stuff and Trump's invincible in 2020 and they were able to steal it by just a few thousand votes per battleground state.
[00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.160]  6,000 in Georgia, 11,000 in Michigan, less than 15,000 in Arizona.
[00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:59.342]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:00.443]  Pennsylvania, you name it.
[00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:10.130]  So they are in full panic mode and trying to kill him because they know they don't have enough dead people, people that have moved out of district, and illegal aliens to steal it from Trump this time.
[00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.033]  So that's why we've got to push harder than ever.
[00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.074]  Go vote.
[00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.115]  Get your family to vote.
[00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.297]  If you're in a red state, don't think they're not going to try to steal it.
[00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:20.398]  Every vote counts.
[00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:21.979]  If you're in a blue state, because RFK,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.841]  Backing Trump.
[00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:25.522]  Those are now in play for Trump.
[00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:28.444]  And the battlegrounds are, again, absolutely central.
[00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:31.025]  And more importantly than ever, the information war.
[00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:35.769]  Take this report and share it with everybody you know, those you don't know, your email list.
[00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.151]  Don't just post it on X. Post it on Instagram.
[00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.091]  Post it on Google.
[00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:42.353]  Post it on every platform you can.
[00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:43.194]  Post it on Reddit.
[00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:45.055]  Because this is an information war.
[00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:49.378]  The globalists wouldn't be desperately censoring everywhere if they didn't know it was close.
[00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.607]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.777]  So fight like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:05:02.964 --> 00:05:08.286]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:15.809]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.871]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:21.212]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:31.276]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
