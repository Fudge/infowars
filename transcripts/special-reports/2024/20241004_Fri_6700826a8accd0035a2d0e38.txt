[00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.650]  Six years ago, the deep state came for Infowars and almost no one spoke up or took action.
[00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.130]  I warned you then that you were next.
[00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.730]  Now the globalists have launched a new, more vicious attack.
[00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.989]  The precedent is being set right now to literally steal my identity and shut down Infowars.
[00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.609]  Will the public rally to my support this time?
[00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.269]  Or sit back and be targeted themselves and picked off one by one?
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.100]  The globalist deep state just took their war on free speech and our very identities and our very freedoms to the next level.
[00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:50.759]  They have now introduced a lawsuit against me where they literally claim they own my name, my social media, and me personally in violation of the 13th Amendment that we fought the Civil War over.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.560]  They're actually saying I'm an indentured servant, that I am a slave.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.479]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm always the canary in the coal mine.
[00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:59.960]  I am the test case.
[00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.460]  And when they get through me, they're coming after you.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.719]  The biggest attack yet, not just on the First Amendment, but on the 13th Amendment in modern history is now taking place.
[00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:25.500]  Now, as you know, InfoWars has been under major lawfare Democrat Party deep state attack for at least seven years.
[00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.359]  The only other person that's been more demonized in the attack is President Trump, and of course now they're going after Elon Musk.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.659]  But in the long run, they have been after me massively.
[00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.700]  They see me as a populist leader that has been absolutely critical in exposing their agenda, and they want me off the air.
[00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.370]  So... InfoWars is up for sale November 13th.
[00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.750]  If patriots are unable to buy it, it will be shut down.
[00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.129]  Soros funded group Media Matters says they're going to try to buy it.
[00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.530]  But that's a separate issue.
[00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.090]  That already broke the last few weeks.
[00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.170]  What I'm about to talk about...
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.530]  Just happened last night and again is unprecedented.
[00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.269]  And this affects Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson.
[00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.210]  It affects Elon Musk.
[00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.629]  It affects President Trump.
[00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.930]  It affects you.
[00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:41.270]  It affects all populists or conservatives or people that just want to stop World War III. The Democrat Party law firm run by Senator Blumenthal up in Connecticut has openly come out and filed in Travis County in the Democrat-controlled It's just as bad as New York or DC with the lawfare to appoint a receiver over me that literally controls everything I do,
[00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.129]  controls my bank account, literally makes me property of these people.
[00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.469]  Now, under the 13th Amendment we'll put on screen, you're not supposed to be able to do this.
[00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.310]  Plus, I'm still in bankruptcy court.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.159]  And the Texas Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit, over and over again have ruled against these receivers and said it violates the 13th Amendment.
[00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:10.879]  But worse than that, Connecticut and Texas law say, while the fake billion and a half dollar judgments are on appeal...
[00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.349]  You can't execute any of these collections, but they haven't stopped trying.
[00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.650]  And so, to all the other great talk show hosts out there, I've defended your speech.
[00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.629]  I've stood up for you when you get persecuted.
[00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.310]  I need you to defend Infowars because this is a precedent.
[00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:37.639]  We're good to go.
[00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.009]  With these giant judgments that never go away because they didn't want to settle.
[00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.930]  They said it wasn't about money. They want me off the air.
[00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.310]  They said it on national TV. The Democrat lawyers said it on the courthouse steps in Texas and Connecticut.
[00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.789]  They want me off air.
[00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.330]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.370]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.009]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.830]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.449]  Jones. I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:32.720]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.500]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.920]  So they want to chase me, they want to run me to ground, they want to try to torture me.
[00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.389]  I can handle all that.
[00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.629]  I'm a big boy. I'm taking on the deep state.
[00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.910]  I expect this stuff to happen.
[00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.149]  But what I do need to do is stay on air.
[00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:02.769]  And so regardless of what happens to Infowars, I need legal defense to be able to block what they're doing.
[00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.100]  And to be able to continue on with a new broadcast where I work for someone else.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.540]  Because that's what you do. I can't own companies.
[00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.000]  I can't be the boss.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.379]  But I can be the boss of what I talk about on air.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:22.240]  So as long as I work for other companies or a company that doesn't violate my speech, I'll be totally happy to stay on the air that way.
[00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.480]  But in the interim, I've got to fight in the federal and state court where they're not just saying they own me.
[00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.040]  They've also filed in federal court and also in the state court saying they own the name Alex Jones.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.699]  And that they own real Alex Jones on X. Now, the courts have all said you can't do things like that, but they're trying it.
[00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:47.759]  And if I don't aggressively battle them in the state and federal court, they will get a win if I don't challenge it.
[00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.620]  And then they'll be able to use that tactic on you as well.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.079]  So I'm asking everyone to research the case, to read about the filings below, to look at the news articles I'm putting up on screen.
[00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.100]  I know it sounds crazy to own my name and own my social media.
[00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:19.170]  That's never been done before, but they are trying it, and I'm asking you to go to therealalexjones.com, and that takes you right to the great folks, the Patriot crowdsourcing site, GiveSinGo, where you can donate $10, $100, $1,000 in this critical fight.
[00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.649]  The globalists hate my broadcast.
[00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.810]  They're obsessed with taking it off the air.
[00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:24.860]  They want to set that precedent.
[00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:46.339]  And when you support me staying on the air in the face of this tyranny, it is so important to the future of America and of the entire world as we expose the human trafficking, as all the CIA pedophile sex rings come out, as Kamala and Mayorkas trafficking 325,000 children into slavery and physical slavery and sex slavery,
[00:06:46.339 --> 00:07:02.899]  as we try to stop World War III, as we expose the private Federal Reserve, as When populism and the public awaken to the New World Order, in my 30-plus years on air, this is the most important time ever because now Infowars has so much credibility.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.259]  People know we are tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:16.220]  Well, even if they take Infowars, I'm the guy that created InfoWars and that's why they again want to come in and own my name and come in and say that they own my likeness and own me.
[00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:22.839]  I'm not like Prince who signed a 360 record deal with a record company to own his likeness and his name and all of his music.
[00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.529]  I'm a talk show host under the First Amendment who's always said my work is free and open to the public and copyright free.
[00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.889]  So they've got big problems.
[00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.550]  We're going to beat them. But I've got to have the top law firms to do that.
[00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.649]  So please go to realalexjones.com, make a donation on Give, Send, Go.
[00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:41.410]  There's nowhere you can donate anywhere.
[00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:49.569]  Where it'll go as far in the fight against tyrants as Gibson Go and my Keep Alex Jones Broadcast on the Air page.
[00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:58.670]  Separately, if you want to get great t-shirts and ball caps that spread the word and expose the globalists, Then you go to thealexjonesstore.com, and that's my sponsor.
[00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.569]  It's going to help with the fight as well.
[00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.810]  And then, no matter what happens to InfoWars, I intend, again, to continue on.
[00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:16.189]  I intend to try to bring as much of the crew as I can with me, and it's going to be those sponsors that are critical in that fight, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com for great supplements, and more.
[00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.410]  So again, we hope to get a good buyer for InfoWars.
[00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.790]  We hope to stay on air, but regardless of what happens there, they're moving in on the 17th of October.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:33.379]  In Texas, in Travis County, in front of these leftist judges, in an attempt to literally come in and say a receiver owns me and everything I do.
[00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.179]  Let me read to you. The 13th Amendment.
[00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:49.399]  And this is slavery.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.600]  It violates the 13th Amendment.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.179]  And I will never be silenced.
[00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:54.480]  I will never be intimidated.
[00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.620]  I will never shut up.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.519]  But this is the next level of censorship and control is them saying they own my name.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.460]  They own my social media, that is my likeness, and they own me and my paycheck personally.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.740]  You can't do that.
[00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:16.620]  You can try to grab money out of somebody's account, but you can't stop their employers from giving you the paycheck.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.720]  They have to try to get that from you with collection agencies and things.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:29.440]  So they are really trying to get rid of the bankruptcy laws and protections in this country The Democrats are literally coming for everybody.
[00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:40.580]  So that's why I'm asking you respectfully and all the other talk show hosts and others that are going to be the next targets to stand with me and to support InfoWars and to support myself so that I can continue to fight.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.240]  I just want to stay in the fight.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.179]  I just want to win this thing.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.039]  I just want to back President Trump.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.860]  I don't ever want to give up.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.120]  So please, keep me in the fight.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.899]  Go to realalexjones.com.
[00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:57.820]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and support this fight because we are right at the tip of the spear.
[00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.919]  We've only been successful due to your support.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.279]  And I humbly ask you your future support.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.240]  And I humbly thank you for everything you've done.
[00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.919]  God bless. Now, everything is in your court.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.139]  I am in your hands.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.139]  And you are in my hands because my fate will end up being your fate.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.720]  Please stand with me at this critical time in the battle for our republic.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.240]  Hi, I'm Kamala Harris.
[00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:28.720]  When I'm elected president, platforms that promote free speech, truth, and resilience to the New World Order, like TheAlexJonesStore.com, will be banned.
[00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:33.940]  Sites that profit off dangerous truths are a threat to our democracy.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:43.100]  Shirts sold at TheAlexJonesStore.com, like the InfoWars limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, will no longer be tolerated.
[00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:47.549]  And let's be clear. If you're caught wearing one of these shirts, you will face arrest.
[00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:59.470]  Whether it's the Alex Jones for President 2028 shirt or any other merchandise pushing harmful messages of patriotism, family, faith, and freedom, this kind of propaganda has no place in our future.
[00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.669]  We will create a future where safety, censorship, and tyranny prevail.
[00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:10.149]  Don't go to thealexjonesstore.com to purchase products that keep Alex Jones on the air.
[00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.049]  Don't wear the shirts or support humanity.
[00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.009]  If you do, you'll be the first in line for my depopulation agenda.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.299]  Now obviously that is AI satire of Kamala Harris.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.820]  That's not really her.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.620]  But if you look at her policies and what she supported and what big tech and the Democrats want and what Hillary Clinton has said.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.279]  There are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:44.190]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:52.769]  Whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrent.
[00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:55.299]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.179]  They indeed do want to put people in jail for their free speech.
[00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:07.360]  And the Justice Department, the Chiefs controlled by, that's hijacked this country, has been running the whole operation trying to shut down Infowars.
[00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:11.080]  And on November 13th, it goes up for auction.
[00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:14.039]  And the Democrats have said, they never wanted money from me.
[00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:15.179]  They wanted me silenced.
[00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.759]  That was always their goal.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:26.330]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:33.029]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:36.789]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:42.409]  Jones. I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:53.669]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:12:54.370 --> 00:13:04.450]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:14.129]  They're scared of satire because real satire, powerful satire, takes a truth and then basically presents it to show how absurd it is.
[00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:22.129]  So I'm asking all of you for your support to fund the AlexJonesStore.com and get these great t-shirts and ball caps.
[00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.730]  So one way or another, my broadcast continues on, regardless of what happens.
[00:13:27.909 --> 00:13:37.269]  We may be able to get some patriots to outbid Soros and Media Matters for Infowars and this operation, but regardless, myself and the crew want to come roaring back.
[00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:40.509]  So support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.750]  Get these amazing shirts. That's how you keep us on air.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:52.620]  And these shirts are so timely, launching the First Amendment and Second Amendment Defense League, standing up for the right of free speech and self-defense.
[00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:58.559]  This shirt and so many other amazing shirts, now available exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.820]  This is serious.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.039]  This affects the entire country and the world.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.500]  They're trying to get through me, as Trump says, to get to you.
[00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:06.799]  So please stand with us.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.259]  I thank you all for your support.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.460]  Plus, these are amazing shirts at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.419]  Please take action.
