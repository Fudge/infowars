[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.159]  A lot of excitement today.
[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.759]  We are joined by Alex Jones, of course, the host of InfoWars.
[00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.559]  We've got a lot to get into today.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.099]  Amongst other things, I want to hear his story.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.839]  Enough people focus on his history and how he's gotten to where he is now.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.739]  And his career has spanned decades.
[00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.089]  And of course, notoriety for some of his views on topics and government overreach.
[00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.410]  And there's actually memes out there about Alex Jones' right when he was thought to have been conspiratorial.
[00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.590]  Lo and behold, turned out to be right, which is so many of the things that we learn about today.
[00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.229]  Alex, welcome. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.590]  It was great to have you on my show. It was great to be there.
[00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.729]  Listen, I wanted, if you don't mind, I want to start by talking about you, if you don't mind.
[00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:49.009]  I don't really see anybody interviewing you about your life, your career, your history.
[00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.909]  I'm sure they did at one time, but I don't see that very often anymore.
[00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.969]  And as a guy that spent 35 years on the radio myself, I'm intrigued by your radio career, how you got involved with that.
[00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.090]  Do you mind talking about these things?
[00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.859]  I'm more than happy to. Where did you grow up?
[00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.260]  What kind of family did you grow up in?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.780]  Who is Alex Jones? I'm trying to figure that part out.
[00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.260]  It's not that easy to figure out.
[00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.900]  So clue us in on that and then how you got involved in radio.
[00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:32.920]  Sure. I mean, I've been incredibly demonized by the deep state, by the establishment, because I went to a lot of source documents about the permanent bureaucracy and some of the financial interests that would rather America and the world be a totalitarian, centralized technocracy in their own words.
[00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.069]  And so I've been on air 30 years.
[00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:37.810]  I started out on AXS TV in 1994.
[00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.250]  About a year later, I got a local call from a station that was flipping from rock music to talk on FM. We're doing a Saturday show.
[00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.129]  It got good ratings. They gave me a weeknight show.
[00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.590]  I found out how to syndicate it through a small syndicator a few years later.
[00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.750]  So I've been syndicated on radio for...
[00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.109]  27 years. At times, the show got extremely big.
[00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.989]  And then some of the things I said on air, take it out of context in the media, I would get kicked off a lot of stations.
[00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:06.989]  That happened after 9-11.
[00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.069]  Some of the things I said there, I was on over 200 radio stations, some of them huge then.
[00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.409]  And I went down to about 40 radio stations with my comments about that.
[00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.849]  And then built the show back up over the years.
[00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.729]  Always wanted to find new ways to reach people.
[00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:28.539]  I was one of the first people that was on Google Video and had some of the first document cam or webcams.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.900]  At first, you're showing an image every 30 seconds or so.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.120]  If I could show news articles and also make documentary films starting in the late 90s, 97 or so.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.599]  If I could actually show listeners what I was talking about.
[00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.430]  Yeah, back in 1994, what motivated you to get into that search for the deep state?
[00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.250]  Because I think, you know, to say you were ahead of the curve would be an understatement.
[00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.449]  I think even the concept wasn't something that was being tossed around at the time.
[00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.289]  What was going on with you that you had some insight into this?
[00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.939]  My dad had, in high school, got recruited into UT Plan 2 because he had some of the top test scores in the country.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.860]  And so he got out of it before he ever got into the actual programs after he graduated.
[00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.659]  But he got recruited into the kind of scientific...
[00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.639]  We're good to go.
[00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.060]  And I was a sports guy and everything else, but I did get into reading really early.
[00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.500]  I've always been a voracious reader.
[00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:01.099]  So I got out of comic books when I was about eight or nine and started reading military encyclopedias and history books.
[00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:09.740]  And so I really got into history and read Marco Cirilius' book and read Julius Caesar's writings and then got into Plato and got into Aristotle.
[00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.139]  And then I read Nietzsche's, a couple of his books.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.599]  I read Machiavelli.
[00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.149]  I think?
[00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.870]  And my dad's, you know, dad was really informed.
[00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.610]  His mom was informed. My mother's dad was also, had been in World War II, a fighter pilot, and then he'd been an inventor.
[00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.829]  You know, growing up in Dallas, a successful inventor.
[00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.689]  Growing up kind of in the German community in Dallas, there were a bunch of inventors.
[00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.529]  So I grew up around him and, you know, talking about how the world really worked.
[00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:05.649]  So I was just blessed that I was around a lot of people that were geopolitically aware of, And I remember my dad ranting about Zbigniew Brzezinski when I was like five years old at the dinner table.
[00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.490]  You know, their plans for world government.
[00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.470]  And so that's why I found that really interesting.
[00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.329]  A lot was happening in 94, 95.
[00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.470]  And so I didn't really try to be in the media.
[00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.790]  I wasn't thinking of that as a career.
[00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.910]  I didn't know what I wanted to do. I'm 50 now.
[00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.930]  I was... You know, like, 20 years old when I first got on air.
[00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:27.189]  I thought, I'll go do Access Television, and then that was basically what happened there.
[00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.370]  So it was a 30-year overnight success story.
[00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:35.449]  And then when Trump won, or was about to win, the Democrats even admitted this.
[00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:51.480]  They... We're good to go.
[00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.970]  I think?
[00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.170]  It was pretty bombshell of a CIA guy.
[00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.009]  They were doing another investigation into human trafficking and were interviewing the CIA guy with hidden cameras.
[00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:36.129]  And he also admitted the whole plot to demonize me and take me off air and set the precedent with me and then ban everybody else.
[00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.990]  And so now in hindsight, we know how that was done with Democratic Party, PR firms, and the whole setup.
[00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:50.720]  So I... I really don't even see it as being a victim because it was very interesting to have the deep state kind of put me in its jaws and was quite a learning process.
[00:06:50.939 --> 00:07:02.160]  But because the deep state and the establishment is so discredited, just like all the indictments and convictions of Trump by these show trials has made him more popular, it's now had the opposite effect and made me more popular.
[00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.399]  And so it's a very, very crazy and bizarre place to be historically.
[00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:20.259]  And I kind of jumped ahead from my origin story Just what, you know, the current story, most of your viewers who may have heard of me, but maybe never actually heard me, I mean, I want them to know they can look up everything I just said, and they're actually admitting it.
[00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.560]  You know, that's what's crazy. Hillary Clinton has come out twice the last month and said, get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:31.959]  John Kerry has said the First Amendment stands the way, and that they want to, you know, I mean, now they, Facebook banned advertising.
[00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:36.120]  On Instagram and Facebook under meta of the Reagan movie.
[00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.839]  That's like a sweet family movie.
[00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.899]  Absolutely just a very positive film, not even political.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.079]  Left versus right.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.879]  So now they even want to ban or restrict people seeing the Reagan movie.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.079]  So that shows you where these totalitarians are going.
[00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.579]  Hillary just said last week...
[00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.620]  Well, we're going to lose total control if we don't, you know, get control and start censoring people.
[00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:06.399]  So I was the first test case they now admit I tried to set the precedent to be able to censor everybody else.
[00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:11.259]  And when a lot of people didn't stand up for me being censored, then it set the precedent for everybody else.
[00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:16.240]  And then Trump got banned on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.740]  And they even took down his videos on January 6th saying, be peaceful when you go to the Capitol.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:28.579]  And then later when he said, don't go in, don't be violent, they even removed that so that it couldn't be shown that he was not guilty of what they claimed.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.620]  So that's what's scary about censorship.
[00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.909]  They don't just silence what you're saying.
[00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.850]  They can then lie about you and build a straw man and misrepresent who you are, so they basically steal your identity.
[00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.610]  So it's been very refreshing to have Elon Musk bring me back on X despite all the attacks and demonization and boycotts.
[00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.269]  And now X is the most popular social media platform in the world, and it's dominating.
[00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:59.419]  And so the worm's turning, and humanity has a real hunger and quest for the For the right of not just to say what you want, but the right to hear what somebody else is saying.
[00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:06.299]  And so I'm just very blessed to be part of this major global discourse and have a lot of hope and faith for humanity.
[00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:12.460]  Yeah, I've become a free speech absolutist, and thus you are here with me.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:26.840]  And I noticed that the DOJ put something out today about what they want to do with Google and YouTube, which is essentially dismantle the whole thing, which I think will create an interesting reaction from a very powerful company.
[00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.240]  I can't imagine them doing that.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.039]  But my question to you is, you mentioned Musk.
[00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:43.539]  What do you think about what Musk said about the We're good to go.
[00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:57.340]  We're good to go.
[00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:07.799]  Even before some of the first cases came up where he just literally was on house arrest, basically, would just check himself in a few hours a day there in Florida to the jail.
[00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:17.320]  And I was told that basically they were using classic honeypots, but it's not enough to have a guy cheating on his wife like 60 years ago.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.600]  Or then the new thing was, oh, the person's gay.
[00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:30.500]  And so in a lot of these elite circles, like Bohemian Grove and things, Powerful people go there literally to be inducted into kind of the rite of passage so that they are in the club.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.919]  Even Nixon talked about it.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.379]  He didn't do it. But he said people basically go there, and the tapes are out there of Nixon, to be in that club.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.100]  Then they think they can trust you. Well, it's not enough to be closeted gay now.
[00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:41.320]  That's not enough dirt on you.
[00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:44.940]  They want you to have sex with underage teenage girls and boys.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.120]  And they've been very, very good at just keeping it to a few 16- and 17-year-olds.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.669]  But what we know about I think?
[00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:21.309]  And he was running that famously, reportedly in the UK, and how they've got control of the UK government with pedophilia.
[00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.929]  And so, Epstein...
[00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:32.019]  He's the most well-known person running one of these honeypot operations, but there's a lot of other organizations and groups that are doing it.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:41.779]  In fact, my uncle on his deathbed 10 years ago told me in East Texas at the hospital, he's dying of pneumonia, and they got a really bad virus.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.639]  He's a healthy guy, but it just looked like Popeye.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.899]  He was in great shape, but it just killed him.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.860]  And right before they put him on the ventilator, he'd already told me some of the stuff.
[00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:52.919]  He told my mom a lot more. I think?
[00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.909]  From Guatemala, little kids.
[00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:10.909]  And he didn't know what they were doing, but they wouldn't get specific.
[00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.190]  And he thought it was child trafficking.
[00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.169]  And so he quit and got out of it then.
[00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.870]  And that was in the late 80s.
[00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:22.529]  He did say that Reagan wasn't even aware of it because he was involved in communications and knew who was running it out of the White House.
[00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:24.149]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush, he told me.
[00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.710]  But that was that point for him.
[00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:28.690]  So this has been going on for a long time.
[00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:35.649]  I remember like 15 years ago, Russia banned orphans coming to the U.S. and Putin said some are in sex slavery.
[00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:39.960]  And so that sounds, those of us that aren't into that, unbelievable.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.200]  But we see the sexualization of children.
[00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:53.620]  You know, the whole transgender thing is about, you know, sexualization of children and secret agreements in public schools where they don't tell the parents that they're convinced the kid to begin transitioning or believe they're transitioning.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.120]  And they put secret files together and they have NGOs that come in.
[00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:01.720]  So this whole attack on our children and their innocence that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:17.070]  is talking about is really massive and central to And so when Musk talks about that, he told, as you know, Tucker, he said, no, I know most of the people in the deep state, and I'm telling you, because we already know some of their names from the flights, like Bill Gates,
[00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:19.649]  the 30-something times, that...
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.960]  This is the deep state.
[00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:28.779]  And then you get into who basically was one of the biggest attendees there at Little St.
[00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:37.700]  John's Island. And of course the Zorro Ranch and other groups is the widow of Steve Jobs and best friends with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.379]  So when you look at this power structure...
[00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.909]  It's just insane.
[00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:51.370]  And Bill Gates, we know, is into giving money to the top scientists and others to control scientific thoughts, and he spends billions every few years on media.
[00:13:51.529 --> 00:14:01.450]  When you see a big piece on him in the newspaper or online in the London Guardian or ABC News, a lot of times at the end they'll say, underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.990]  Now she's now left him and gotten out of the foundation, she said, mainly because of the Jeffrey Epstein thing.
[00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:23.610]  So we're waiting for the next big shoe to drop, but Clearly, they're using blackmail on scientists of the sexual nature, and that's why I believe the evidence shows that that's why Gates is so connected to that.
[00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.710]  And again, it's not like they even trick most of these people.
[00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:32.830]  Just like in the mafia, you've got to kill a few people in the Italian mafia to make your bones in La Cosa Nostra.
[00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:38.029]  Or the family. And then the Mexican Mafia and other mafias are, you know, Hell's Angels.
[00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:42.570]  You've got to commit some murders before you're really a made member because they can control you.
[00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:48.169]  They know that you'll do what you're told and they can destroy you anytime they want.
[00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:57.009]  Well, the rite of passage or the induction ceremony into this globalist cabal is generally pedophilia.
[00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:08.879]  I want to push back on the Bohemian Grove thing for a second, if you don't mind, because I've been practicing medicine here in Southern California for like 40, coming down to 40 years.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.100]  Is it 40 years? Jesus.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:23.720]  And maybe 20 years ago, I had a lot of 80 and 90-year-old patients who were former sort of part of the Reagan inner circle when he was governor of California.
[00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:26.600]  And they all used to go to Bohemian Grove.
[00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:33.730]  You know, right-leaning thing where they would go and hear lectures and stuff and just sort of hang out and smoke cigars.
[00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.409]  I don't know if it's been captured.
[00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:37.370]  I don't have any recent information about it.
[00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:42.389]  But I just want you to file that in your thinking that I actually had direct contact with a number of these guys.
[00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.149]  And they were not, as you described them, now.
[00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:46.590]  So it may be something different now.
[00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.110]  I don't know. But I want to circle.
[00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.649]  That's fascinating. So I can come back to it if you want to say something else now.
[00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.750]  But I would love to agree with you right now.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.580]  I want to be clear. I'm the first person to ever successfully sneak into Bohemian Grove and get the Formation of Care ritual on tape.
[00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.340]  I saw Danny Glover when I was in there.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.980]  I saw one of my, probably my favorite actor, one of my favorite actors, Clint Eastwood, when I was in there.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.519]  There's a thousand members, a thousand guests.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:21.139]  95% of it is just getting, you know, having fun, listening to music, and drinking in this beautiful old Redwood Grove there in Sedoma County on the Russian River.
[00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:32.200]  Richard Nixon, just type it in, Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove, his famous tapes are on that, and he said it's the most GD, you know, faggy thing you've ever seen, and then...
[00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:37.929]  Helmut Schmidt wrote a book about it, talked about it.
[00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:52.049]  And so what I'm saying is, there is a group within that, and you can look up Bohemian Grove Homosexuality, and it's been news articles written about, if you want to get in the club of the club there, a bunch of that is going on.
[00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:55.049]  And of course, Mark Twain found that it wasn't like that in the 1870s.
[00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.110]  And then William Howard Taft, who was a Skull and Bones member and a president.
[00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.389]  The railroad got there.
[00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:01.690]  The Republicans took it over.
[00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.849]  It was more of a Skull and Bones spinoff for adults, kind of ultramasonic.
[00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.750]  But I was simply talking about, you know, used to it, you're cheating on your wife, we got dirt.
[00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:15.089]  And then it's okay, you did kind of a gay ritual like they do at Skull and Bones.
[00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.930]  That's come out. And they do it in like a vat of horse manure.
[00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:23.789]  That's even in The Good Shepherd that was directed and produced by...
[00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:26.170]  Robert De Niro with Matt Damon.
[00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:27.970]  And they've said that's very accurate.
[00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.829]  Of course, Anthony Sutton was the head Senate archivist.
[00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.130]  He got the documents for Charlotte Iserby, whose dad was a member of it.
[00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:35.670]  So that's why we know all that.
[00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:41.170]  But absolutely, most people going to Bohemian Grove are not in homosexual cults.
[00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:51.819]  Sorry, go ahead. And I want to cycle back, and you said you used a phrase about what you were exposed to growing up, how the world works.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.359]  And then you also talked about your love of history.
[00:17:55.759 --> 00:18:08.619]  Given those two experiences, you know, you educated yourself about history, You said something like this always happens or whatever.
[00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:09.839]  I don't know what you meant quite by that.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:17.319]  And how the world works. Help me understand what your theory is about our present moment within the grand historical sweep.
[00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:24.069]  Is this, you know, things history does, maybe it doesn't exactly repeat itself, but it sort of echoes, you know.
[00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:30.089]  And to me, it feels like this kind of thing that's happening now happens every 80 or so years.
[00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.950]  It's different always.
[00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:35.369]  I noticed something yesterday when I was thinking about it.
[00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.609]  Is that this kind of thing never happened before the printing press.
[00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:47.670]  And so technology clearly plays a role in how these things are executed and sort of brought to bear on a mass scale.
[00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:51.750]  And now we've never had such an efficient mass technology.
[00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.430]  How do you understand what's happening in the present moment?
[00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:21.079]  That's a great question. We're good to go.
[00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:39.559]  They believe we're about to transcend, but that most of us won't basically transcend in that.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.099]  So they know a major change is coming, and the establishment wants to stay in power.
[00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:50.140]  And power groups, whether it's in ancient China or Europe or Mesoamerica, anywhere...
[00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:57.369]  Always you see a civilization rise, and then it gets powerful, and then it becomes decadent, and then it declines and collapses.
[00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.990]  And that can happen in different ways.
[00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:07.009]  Of course, there's the saying that hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times.
[00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:14.049]  And so if you read a lot of what the top thinkers think in the establishment, they talk about the end of history.
[00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:26.240]  And they want to have kind of a breakaway civilization of technocracy and elites that keep most of that secret from the public on their government and corporate reservations, kind of city-states within city-states.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.299]  And then the nation-state dissolves away into a kind of a global order that's controlled by three major power blocks and then separate...
[00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:35.279]  Sub-blocks in that.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.099]  And they kind of want the public distracted with video games.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.079]  But does history tell you that's a likely scenario?
[00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:47.059]  And does your understanding of the way the world works indicate to you that that's how it's going?
[00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.259]  It could also be going that way and not work out.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.799]  You know what I mean? History could tell you, no, no, no, this won't happen.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.759]  Does history inform those perceptions you have?
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.259]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.839]  The way you said it, I never heard that.
[00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:02.740]  History repeats somewhat.
[00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:06.279]  It's been said history rhymes, but I agree history echoes.
[00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:09.839]  And so let's be clear.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.579]  I'm stating what the general thought in the different thought thinkers from different angles is.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.839]  And of course, you're informed. You already know that probably more than I do.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.680]  But I totally agree with what you were just kind of hinting at.
[00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:27.099]  And the globalists now, their main mouthpiece is the Atlantic, the Financial Times of London.
[00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:33.359]  I mean, those are really kind of the establishment mouthpieces, the Club of Rome, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission.
[00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:46.319]  They admit they're losing control, and their plan that they thought for this technocracy And this Things to Come that kind of H.G. Wells is one of the progenitors of this neo-eugenics, neo-liberal movement.
[00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.819]  He didn't just write science fiction.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.859]  He wrote a lot of non-fiction like the New World Order and Things to Come.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.759]  They made an early movie out of it for the day.
[00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:55.079]  It was incredibly professional.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.690]  And So now their plan is actually not working.
[00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:11.089]  They also said corporate world government would be administered to end war and to redistribute wealth, not through communism, but through kind of a crony capitalist system.
[00:22:11.369 --> 00:22:14.150]  But of course, we've seen a bigger vertical integration of wealth.
[00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:18.200]  We've ever seen in history and these greedy groups basically pay no taxes.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.160]  And so they have all this altruistic talk.
[00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:24.079]  They even admit it's falling apart because they all just ran off with the money.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.819]  And now they think things are falling apart so bad that it's even mainstream news.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.299]  I broke this, you know, decades ago.
[00:22:31.829 --> 00:22:35.210]  These top billionaires are all building huge bunkers in the middle of nowhere.
[00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:44.869]  Zuckerberg's got his in Kauai, and they are all, you know, just waiting to run to the hills and all have these huge escape yachts that aren't just for entertaining.
[00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:57.690]  And I mean, I knew from sources, I talked about this almost 18 years ago, I was with a big producer in Hollywood, and he went around and showed me the studios of James Cameron, making a movie with him.
[00:22:57.829 --> 00:23:00.450]  They said, oh, Cameron probably won't make many more movies, which he really hasn't.
[00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.130]  Because he thinks the end of the world's coming.
[00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.990]  He's gone to New Zealand and he was going to roll out all the hologram movie theaters and all this, but he just doesn't think it's going to matter.
[00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:19.230]  And then they told me later, I saw pieces of the news that, oh yeah, Cameron, Cameron, you know, has this fleet of ships, he says, looking for sunken ships, but really that's the tax write-off.
[00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.829]  So when everything collapses, he can escape to the ocean.
[00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:23.450]  Well, then now you see the headlines.
[00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:24.730]  The leech, you know, have the...
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.240]  Right. I hear what you're saying. And so that's my question.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.099]  I'm asking you actually to kind of predict the future, what your feeling about the future is.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:41.279]  Because I'm not really... I'm hearing you say that they think it's going to be a catastrophe or they think they're going to be able to centralize and end war and distribute wealth, that kind of thing.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.579]  So my question to you is, is one of those...
[00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:47.559]  History is one of those outcomes...
[00:23:48.639 --> 00:23:50.859]  Likely, in your opinion, or are they just going to fail?
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:59.920]  It's just going to fail, and people are going to get back to taking care of their own families and their own communities and become hyper-localized, which is really the bromide for all this.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:12.619]  What's your prediction? Well, I don't think that the establishment, which act like they're all unified, and they'll agree on certain policies and power grabs, but they're actually fighting with each other.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.140]  They call themselves the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.630]  And notice when Putin talks about the West, he calls it that.
[00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:26.230]  And that's an old term, but that's what they call themselves, kind of the British Empire merged with America and the West, and then kind of the EU is in the middle.
[00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:33.589]  And then China is the other big power block, and then Russia, junior to that, and you've got the Arab states and all the things that are happening.
[00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.650]  But absolutely, that really is the question.
[00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.509]  I believe we control our destiny.
[00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:40.750]  I'm seeing major signs everywhere of not just...
[00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:52.009]  The globalist plan for world government failing, and then there being giant wars due to, you know, the issues that are there, and not just problems they've caused.
[00:24:52.109 --> 00:25:03.450]  We've got plenty of problems the globalists didn't cause, and the technocrats didn't cause, versus people like Elon Musk coming in, admitting, you know, at the World Government Summit last year, put on with the WEF. He said, we want firewalls.
[00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.670]  We want You know, bulkheads and ships.
[00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:07.769]  We don't want a one-world government with centralized stuff.
[00:25:07.829 --> 00:25:14.609]  That always creates a nightmare. We want decentralization and then good ideas globally but also locally that people then adopt.
[00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.529]  Is that going to win? Is that going to happen?
[00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.509]  What's your prediction? I want you to put a bet down.
[00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:40.039]  I want to bet. I would give us about a 60% chance that we're able to stabilize the planet and be honest and release all these advanced technologies and things that the globalists see as disruptive and really not try to dumb people down and not try to have a destabilized population as easy to control.
[00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:44.440]  I believe we can turn the ship around so there's going to be some major crises, some serious wars.
[00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:50.259]  But I'd say about a 60% chance we don't kill each other in a bioweapon war or a nuclear war.
[00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:55.559]  And there's not going to be some utopia that I'm predicting, like, you know, the left or the globalists do.
[00:25:55.579 --> 00:26:10.140]  That's all a lie. But definitely a better course and way more positive, amazing times if people just get informed about issues and demand their rights and also work hard and get excited about innovation and excited about the future.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.799]  I see a golden age, quite frankly.
[00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:14.529]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:16.269]  I've heard that from various sources.
[00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:26.890]  And theoretically, your fourth turning, the book you described, that's kind of what they suggest, is that the generation that comes into the fourth turning is a heroic generation and will cause...
[00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:40.529]  I don't see the road out myself, but I do know that the enemy is over-centralization and that taking care of your own family, your own neighborhood, your own community has always been the answer.
[00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.269]  That's how humans have evolved.
[00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:50.829]  And notice, everything the WEF does, it's just a mouthpiece to the biggest Fortune 100, is you can't have your own organic farm.
[00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.289]  It's bad. Eating meat's bad.
[00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:54.809]  Having a car's bad. Going anywhere's bad.
[00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:57.690]  You're bad. Let us take your life under our control.
[00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.630]  Your life force, your instinct's bad.
[00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:08.630]  Don't have children. They just want us to give up and turn history over to them and just let them be captains of the ship to the point where they don't even realize that we're on a ship or there are captains.
[00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:10.150]  They just want us out of the way.
[00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:12.569]  Definitely that power structure's imploding.
[00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:29.509]  We're good to go.
[00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:44.609]  I would get 95% love over the years, but wasn't super famous.
[00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.569]  People knew who I was, but I would shake hands at the grocery store, when I'd walk the dog, when I'd go to church, you know, anywhere.
[00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.910]  I ran into a lot of people that liked the show or see my work.
[00:27:52.470 --> 00:28:05.230]  When Trump got in, it went from, you know, 99% love, because people don't like you, aren't going to say anything usually, to, you know, 90% love, 10% being yelled at on the street, yelled at in restaurants, yelled at in grocery stores, yelled at at the mall, yelled at at the doctor's office.
[00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:14.609]  And then when they started indicting Trump and people saw how bad Biden was, I get yelled at every six months now in public or something.
[00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:17.450]  And even people that shake their heads at me and go, you know, actually, you're right.
[00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:19.650]  You know, I was wrong about you. And it's not about me.
[00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:26.670]  It's just that I'm seen as a bellwether that the system said is the most evil person since Satan and, you know, since Adolf Hitler.
[00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:31.769]  And the system's so discredited that their attack on me is the endorsement I could never do.
[00:28:32.109 --> 00:28:36.109]  And so that, to me, is emblematic of how big the...
[00:28:36.109 --> 00:28:38.299]  Yeah. Yeah. You just made me think.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.940]  I'm so committed to free speech.
[00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:42.000]  If you were Satan, I would still talk to you.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:48.859]  I would love to interview Satan.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.740]  Sure. Right, me too.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.259]  But two things.
[00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:55.460]  And then, Caleb, you're going to come in here because my...
[00:28:55.759 --> 00:29:00.740]  My technical director is a big, big Alex Jones fan.
[00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:02.480]  He had a couple questions. I want to give him a chance.
[00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:05.440]  But two comments of what you just said before we do.
[00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:14.019]  It was either Peter Thiel or Mark Dandresen said, be careful with the darkest before the dawn, because another way to look at it is it's darkest before it's pitch black.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.180]  So be careful.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.299]  It can get a lot worse before it gets better.
[00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:21.140]  No, I agree. I don't think we've hit bottom yet.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.420]  I don't think we've hit bottom yet.
[00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:25.180]  Go ahead. Okay, fair enough.
[00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:26.980]  Fair enough. I'll quote you on that.
[00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:34.779]  And as far as captains, you know, these centralizing captains, how much of a student of history do you have to be to understand how bad that turns out?
[00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:37.180]  Every time. Every time.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.480]  You name it.
[00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.880]  It ends badly.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.319]  You name it. Any historical sweep.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.880]  And when there's a centralization of...
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.200]  Anything, it ends badly.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.940]  So I just want to point that out again.
[00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:52.180]  But, Caleb, you have some questions for Alex, I assume?
[00:29:52.630 --> 00:30:01.150]  Yeah, hi, Alex. I grew up in Austin, Texas, actually, so I remember listening to you on my dad's radio decades and decades ago, and you probably remember this as well.
[00:30:01.369 --> 00:30:09.690]  Back then, all of us were just, like, the crazy anti-vaxxer, homeschooler, farm prepper people, like the real outcasts of society.
[00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.710]  But now you fast forward to the day...
[00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.549]  That was you, Al. That was Caleb. He's describing himself.
[00:30:13.849 --> 00:30:18.190]  That was back then. But, I mean, a lot of us, like, you show up at these events, and it's, like, kind of the same type of people.
[00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:21.309]  But that was 20, 30 years ago, the outcasts.
[00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:25.170]  But now you fast forward to today and all of a sudden, like, Alex Jones, that's a household name.
[00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:26.470]  Everybody knows who Alex Jones is.
[00:30:26.569 --> 00:30:30.210]  And now you have Dr. Drew talking about this rational revolution stuff.
[00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:34.230]  So it's not my mother's fringe group anymore.
[00:30:34.609 --> 00:30:36.549]  But then with that, what's happening...
[00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:38.849]  But Caleb, hold on.
[00:30:39.009 --> 00:30:49.809]  You bring up something interesting, which I'll let you finish your question, but I hope Alex can also point out, which is I worry about people becoming paranoid or conspiratorial and detaching from reality.
[00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:51.450]  I really worry about that.
[00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.250]  I also worry about the delusionality and aggression on the left.
[00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.289]  Because I'm so moderate, I sit in the middle and see the excesses on both sides.
[00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:01.289]  But finish your... We'll let him contextualize your question with that.
[00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:06.599]  Go ahead, finish. Actually, what I'm talking about is something that goes even further than that.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:16.420]  It's a step beyond, deeper into this anxiety spiral where it's the movement that's inside of our movement that's now saying, wait a second, something is so suspicious.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:22.559]  Why are the powers that be that have all the power in the world allowing people like Alex Jones or Dr.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:30.000]  Drew to speak freely about globalism and the NSA and Big Pharma Unless they're controlled opposition, that's the new term.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:38.920]  So how do you respond to, like, the allies that should be your allies who suddenly think that you're the enemy just because people are finally listening to you after all these years?
[00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:42.779]  It's a great question because that is all about the paranoia I was talking about.
[00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.319]  So let's let Alex answer that.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.960]  Absolutely. And by the way, I told you guys I had to go in 45 minutes because I have to sign a document because my bankruptcy is ending in the next few days.
[00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:52.339]  But I've got time.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.920]  I can do another 20 minutes or whatever you want.
[00:31:54.099 --> 00:31:55.619]  Or if you want to kick me out of here in five, I can stay.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.140]  But this is a really important question.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.819]  I'm glad you asked the best I've heard.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.720]  And I could literally talk for 10 hours about this, but let me try to boil this down for people.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.940]  I know 100% that I'm a real person, organic, self-trained.
[00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:10.299]  I really care about people.
[00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:11.599]  I care about my children.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.960]  If you care about your children, you care about the world they're going to grow up in.
[00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:17.660]  You don't have the sociopathic idea that you get ahead by hurting people.
[00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:21.920]  It's the opposite. So that said, let me answer the question this way.
[00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:25.759]  Elon Musk's brother got really sick from the COVID shot.
[00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:34.180]  Elon Musk's son, he sent him to an elite school, as his girlfriend said, and then they basically took him away from him, and in his views, he's dead.
[00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.380]  I mean, they're chemically castrating him.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.279]  So they messed with him, even though he was one of the richest people in the world.
[00:32:41.369 --> 00:32:46.650]  Elon Musk, you judge a tree by its fruits, as Christ said, is devastating the current power structure.
[00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.950]  And you can say he sees them going down and he wants to position himself in the future.
[00:32:51.329 --> 00:32:59.369]  Okay, fine. The point is, is that all the top talk show hosts, you know, whether it's Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan or Dr.
[00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:03.500]  Drew or, you know, you name it, I mean, I can name hundreds of really big people.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:16.680]  All the top shows are anti-globalist, pro-human decentralization because we're sane and don't want to destroy the world and don't want to centralize tyranny and don't want a universal credit score and don't want our medical freedom taken away.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.900]  And so... There's a strong life force to be free and be successful.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.059]  So that's the pull, but you're right.
[00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:29.779]  People get red-pilled, and then they go out there, and there's a lot of stuff.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:36.799]  Just because there's extreme lying by Kamala Harris denying she's against fracking or wants to take your guns or just next-level lying...
[00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:48.690]  I think?
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:34:01.170]  And so that's, but at the end of the day, that can get unhealthy, but it's less unhealthy than believing everything you're told.
[00:34:01.329 --> 00:34:02.509]  And I think that's a process.
[00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:18.119]  So you have red pill, you have black pill that thinks everything's doomed, and then you've got people that are awake and trying to learn that a red pill, you've got black pill that thinks everything's screwed, everybody's bad but them, and then you've got the white pill that thinks everything's, you know, Fine, either with the establishment or you think it's all going to turn out okay.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.119]  I'm not red pill, black pill, or white pill.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.820]  I invented a term called, just recently, green pill.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:37.360]  And by that, I know we go through processes, birth, growth, development, seeking, declining, dying, in civilizations, in people, in life, in the universe, in stars, in galaxies, in everything.
[00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:42.989]  And so it's more about knowing the processes that It's not like I know how the world works.
[00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:56.650]  I can see the processes in history and laws and tendencies and how the ripples in the pond from the pebble and the Hegelian dialect and how these systems work and how the establishment thinks trying to get full control.
[00:34:56.849 --> 00:34:57.889]  They're not omnipresent.
[00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.070]  All the propaganda and censorship would not be necessary.
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.809]  It's been said a million times. We didn't have power.
[00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.590]  So people need to have faith in humanity.
[00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:08.010]  We go through these cycles.
[00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.929]  There's not just evil, not just corruption, not just ignorance, not just selfishness.
[00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:13.829]  And most of it's not organized evil.
[00:35:13.929 --> 00:35:17.989]  It's lazy people just doing whatever's easy and going with the flow and stagnation.
[00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:23.849]  And so people have to make them feel more superior to claim I'm loyal opposition to God knows what, fine.
[00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:30.710]  But I have the establishment literally trying to destroy me, the Justice Department, in the news, calling for me to be shut down.
[00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.889]  And so I am a maverick, and I am a person that believes in humanity.
[00:35:35.309 --> 00:35:38.230]  And so it doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:41.349]  I've made plenty of mistakes. But the difference is I know that I know nothing.
[00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:46.730]  These people that think they know everything know absolutely nothing.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.980]  Right, right. And I mean, that's the biggest sign for me is like you literally you just said a minute ago, you have to leave our show soon to go sign some bankruptcy documents.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.699]  Like if you were a CIA asset, that would have gone away a long time ago.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:03.000]  And I know Drew isn't controlled opposition, because I'd be getting those sweet little CIA commission checks.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.019]  Like I'd have a lot more stuff.
[00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.329]  I'd get commissions on that.
[00:36:06.489 --> 00:36:12.289]  So I know internally, I don't know how to prove it, but I know absolutely certain that he's not a CIA asset.
[00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:15.849]  One of the things about delusions is they can't be reasoned with.
[00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.190]  So I'd be careful.
[00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:32.329]  And that's why it drives me crazy is because it seems like it's such a defeatist attitude because for me as someone who grew up As an outcast, because my family was like this, I understand the suspicions, because for so long we were exclusively outsiders.
[00:36:32.989 --> 00:36:38.690]  And it reminds me of, there was a guy, I don't know if you're familiar with, Hal Turner, from back in 2008, where he was an FBI informant.
[00:36:38.789 --> 00:36:45.630]  This has happened before with people who are radio hosts, that they get turned by the CIA or the FBI and they infiltrate the movements.
[00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:48.260]  I'm sure it's happening right now with some people.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:56.500]  And it's very easy to spot those people, like that Michigan militia that the FBI created to try to get to kidnap Whitmer.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:04.260]  I mean, Hal Turner was openly stirring stuff up and then trying to get crazies to organize things so the FBI would have a setup.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:11.860]  Even like the New York Times back when it was half-decent 20 years ago ran the headline, the majority of terror plots are hatched and run by the FBI. I think that's the exact...
[00:37:19.819 --> 00:37:21.219]  Right.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.199]  I mean, this is real.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.780]  And so it doesn't mean Trump's perfect or I'm perfect, but Trump's a hospitality guy, golf courses, hotels.
[00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:47.260]  He wants prosperity.
[00:37:47.539 --> 00:38:01.420]  I mean, he went to Kim Jong Un and said, or Kim Jong Il's son, and showed him a video of computer graphics of hotels and golf courses, and Kim Jong Un reportedly cried, but China basically controls North Korea, so he couldn't do it.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.780]  He said, why have slaves?
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.519]  Why don't you have golf courses?
[00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.000]  Why don't you be a rock star?
[00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:11.949]  And that's what Trump wants is like Santa Claus to have fun and believe in humanity.
[00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.610]  And so you can judge him by what he does.
[00:38:14.789 --> 00:38:16.849]  You can judge me. I'm the same type of guy.
[00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:22.130]  I just want open, free, great society, masculinity, femininity.
[00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.829]  If you want to be whatever, something, you want to say you're a dog, that's fine.
[00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.449]  Just don't try to teach my kid at school to crap in a cat box.
[00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.369]  We don't want to be part of the mental illness, but you can go be mentally ill if you want.
[00:38:31.449 --> 00:38:33.469]  So I come from Access Television.
[00:38:33.889 --> 00:38:35.210]  I'm real. So that's my question.
[00:38:35.469 --> 00:38:47.610]  That's what that leads to. So as someone who's been in this, and you've seen a lot of actual controlled opposition go in and out of this whole movement, what are some signs of actual controlled opposition agents that are infiltrating?
[00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.429]  Because I can pick two or three out right now that are pretty clear.
[00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.250]  I'm going to kick you off.
[00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:56.789]  I've got to finish with Alex after that, so I'll let him answer your question.
[00:38:57.389 --> 00:38:58.869]  Because I know it's bothering you.
[00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.769]  I'd be happy to have your producer on.
[00:39:01.889 --> 00:39:06.030]  We should have this discussion on my show and do two hours commercial free or simulcast.
[00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.949]  This is great. There you go.
[00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.090]  I like that idea.
[00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:12.030]  Yeah. Caleb, simulcast.
[00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.349]  There you go. We'll figure that out.
[00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.809]  Absolutely. I would absolutely do it.
[00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:18.730]  Yeah, I mean, one thing I've never done is infight.
[00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:25.670]  I've never tried to be territorial or like the gatekeeper like the left, like I'm a fact checker and I say what's real and what's not.
[00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:32.869]  Most of these government plants and people reveal themselves, or they're not government plants, but they get in trouble, then they flip to the other side.
[00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:41.369]  Look, I've had the Justice Department in the mediations, which I couldn't talk about until they said it openly outside of mediation, and my lawyer said, no, go ahead and talk about it.
[00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:46.989]  They have federal prosecutors and people running these fake lawsuits against me, and they literally say...
[00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:55.139]  There in federal court and places with a judge in federal mediation and state mediation, look, just, we'll drop all this.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.679]  We just have a, we want you to come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:00.780]  And I say, okay, let me guess, there's more.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.920]  And they go, actually, there is.
[00:40:02.059 --> 00:40:04.719]  Are you open? And I said, no, of course there's more.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.400]  I wouldn't come out against the Second Amendment to be left alone.
[00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:15.710]  But I said, plus I know once I feed the pirate, once I feed the crocodile, it's always going to come back for more, like a social credit score.
[00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:16.929]  They're always going to raise the bar.
[00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.070]  And so I said, no, I know how this works.
[00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:28.489]  So I literally had them say, we will drop all this before they had their show trials and after.
[00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.010]  Give you bend the knee.
[00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.750]  And they just can't believe...
[00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.090]  So, I mean, you talk about the deep state.
[00:40:34.269 --> 00:40:48.269]  I am saying these Democrat Party law firms run by Senator Blumenthal, the same ones that sue Trump and Giuliani and all of them, they spent $70 million, that's in court filings, the last seven years suing me and attacking me and lying about me, trying to get...
[00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:50.269]  I've spent $15 million fighting them, okay?
[00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:55.630]  And literally, I break bombshells that are confirmed I've said this on air.
[00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.090]  Notice they don't say it's not true.
[00:40:57.269 --> 00:40:58.409]  They don't respond back.
[00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.369]  They literally politically did all this.
[00:41:00.489 --> 00:41:02.730]  On the courthouse steps, they say, we want him off the air.
[00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:05.369]  They refuse a $70 million settlement with me.
[00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.170]  Over 10 years, I have to bust my ass to pay him that, more than I ever made personally before.
[00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:11.329]  They lie and say I have $4 million in the bank.
[00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.789]  All of it was BS, and they said it's not about money, no settlement.
[00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.670]  So they can now, with a non-dischargeable judgment of a billion and a half dollars...
[00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:23.900]  We're good to go.
[00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:53.260]  But they knew to go to the factories and military bases because the Germans put up their flak guns, and they saw the flak, the explosions of shrapnel, and they flew into it.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:42:01.900]  But just like my grandfather Jerry Jones flew into the flak over Italy and Germany, I'm flying into the flak, and I love it, and their attacks are my radar.
[00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:05.519]  I go to where I'm being punched in the face and attack the hardest.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.760]  That is my heat-seeking missile, and I love it.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.179]  I love it. I love it.
[00:42:11.539 --> 00:42:13.420]  Alex, I appreciate you being here.
[00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:19.679]  You mentioned GWF Hagel a few minutes ago, and I will just finish with an interpretation.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:34.860]  He spoke in a lot of—his language was sort of impenetrable, but one of the things he said about history is history is—he said this, the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the setting of dusk.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:46.059]  The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the setting of dusk, which means that the wisdom of history reveals itself only once it's passed.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.119]  So we will see where this all goes, you and I, and we will have more conversations, I hope.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.480]  And I appreciate you being here, and good luck with your paperwork today.
[00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:59.659]  It sounds unpleasant, but I get that you're over the target.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.000]  So I appreciate you being here.
[00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:19.599]  Appreciate you. If people can find The Forbidden Show at realalexjonesonx, please follow me there at infowars.com until the 13th, where it goes up on the chopping block, and the patriots are trying to buy it, but Soros, through Media Matters, is probably going to buy it, shut it down as some celebration, and they're going to try to, you know, like a Roman standard they've captured,
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.739]  mount it on the wall. It's only going to make us bigger because we know we're winning.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.360]  We only lose if they convince us that we've lost.
[00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:27.239]  We're winning. Humanity's turning the tide.
