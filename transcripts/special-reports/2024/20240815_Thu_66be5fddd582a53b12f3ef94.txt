[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:13.017]  Well, you gotta put a lot of money in the Alex Jones was right tip jar, and the Cy Hirst was right jar, because they've now come out and admitted that Vladimir Putin and those evil Russians didn't blow up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:25.304]  The CIA two weeks ago told the German government, the number one paper in Germany's reporting, Der Spiegel, that the Ukrainians would blow up the Nord Stream Pipeline in the Baltic Sea
[00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:28.047]  To cut money off to Russia.
[00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:31.188]  Now, if you look at Kibono in Latin, who benefits from this?
[00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:49.252]  Russia doesn't benefit, Europe doesn't benefit, but the globalist faction that wants to use Ukraine as the detonator to collapse Europe and bring in what they're calling Marshall Plan II to give unlimited trillions to the central banks, to themselves, they stand to gain from this.
[00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:58.756]  The only suspect, in terms of discovering the obvious, was the United States.
[00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:03.158]  If you knew something about the history of the pipeline, something about the oil business, as I do.
[00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:03.658]  September 26, 2022.
[00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.300]  The Nord Stream Pipeline 2 gets blown up in several places.
[00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:23.134]  And of course, just months before, Joe Biden said, if Russia goes into Ukraine, we will remove or get rid of the Nord Stream pipeline.
[00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:32.603]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:38.168]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.690]  We will bring an end to it.
[00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:51.637]  How will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?
[00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.824]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.432]  And there was a NATO drill going on in the ocean in the days before it was blown up.
[00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:18.259]  But immediately, the globalist corporate media came out and said it was Vladimir Putin and any of us that pointed at, who obviously had the motive, cutting off a third of Europe's gas supply and destroying their economy, why we were conspiracy theorists.
[00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:35.056]  The Wall Street Journal, early this morning, comes out with a huge report claiming that with a sailboat, basically, a small yacht as they're calling it, and six men acting alone, but Zelensky knew, went out there and
[00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:40.221]  Dove 260 feet under the ocean and blew up the pipeline.
[00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.643]  This is plausible deniability.
[00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:44.425]  It's what intelligence agencies do.
[00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:46.908]  These guys are obvious fall guys.
[00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:53.654]  They're obvious patsies, just like you have the lone gunman with the Trump attempted assassination or the assassination of
[00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:56.558]  JFK back in the early 1960s.
[00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:58.980]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.148]  And Germany has filed an arrest warrant supposedly for the leader of the group that went and did this.
[00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:07.229]  Some nebulous name.
[00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:17.667]  This is classic, ladies and gentlemen, and it's not getting a lot of attention in the media because it flies in the face of everything we were told yet again.
[00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:22.248]  But if you go back 11 years ago, NATO and the U.S.
[00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:36.613]  government, quarterbacked by George Soros, who bragged about it later on CNN on Fareed Zakaria's show, have been in a proxy war overthrowing multiple Ukrainian governments and launching terror attacks against Russian ethnic areas that are basically 99% Russia in the east.
[00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:50.400]  And that's what Putin got angry about and got sucked into this wider war, this proxy war or this hybrid war that's now gone into a full war with Ukraine 11 days ago.
[00:03:53.936 --> 00:04:05.102]  Again, trying to gouge Putin into escalating so NATO has a pretext to officially enter the war.
[00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:07.383]  Again, NATO is running this whole thing.
[00:04:07.443 --> 00:04:11.785]  There's NATO mercenaries from the U.S., England, Poland, France.
[00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:16.128]  There's officially French troops in Ukraine directing artillery and missiles.
[00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:18.489]  Hypersonic missiles have been moved up.
[00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.112]  That can be nuclear-tipped to the border with Russia?
[00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:27.615]  I mean, this is serious, hardcore, crazy escalation and provocation.
[00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:34.439]  And then, of course, we now know that it was not Putin that blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline, and it wasn't the Ukrainians, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:35.580]  It was NATO.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.665]  And I believe two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Cy Hersh's analysis and his sources about it being an official U.S.
[00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:46.386]  Navy operation.
[00:04:47.352 --> 00:05:03.751]  But again, this is all being done to cover up the history of what really happened because it's an international war crime and it's also a crime against civilian infrastructure to blow up that gas when many people literally froze to death in Germany and other areas in the last few years because they couldn't afford the heating.
[00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:05.954]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.406]  Historically, societies and civilizations go through about 87-year cycles, going back thousands of years.
[00:05:13.807 --> 00:05:15.769]  History really does repeat and rhyme.
[00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:24.217]  And we're going through, in this time frame, what's called the fourth turning right now, and the end of the global bubble, and so many things.
[00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:27.600]  And when you have a major turning, you have a major war.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.144]  World War I, World War II, but now we're in a mega turning.
[00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:39.150]  Because of all the technology and the population and the developments and information, everything is accelerated and made more intense.
[00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.895]  And so right on time, civil unrest, open borders, inflation, wars popping up and expanding all over the planet.
[00:05:46.475 --> 00:06:00.746]  This is a very dangerous time we're going into, political attempted assassinations, assassinations, because there are times in history that happened over just a few years where things liquefy, is what the political scientists call it.
[00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:02.209]  Or the social engineers.
[00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.090]  Normally it's rigid and status quo.
[00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:12.317]  But during these crises, during these realignments, if the power structure doesn't create a new paradigm and a new excuse for control, they lose power.
[00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:19.403]  So they almost always bring in a bunch of destabilization that they can control the crisis and come out as the savior.
[00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:27.349]  And so that's why they are ruling through the politics of crisis creation, crisis management, and destabilization.
[00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.310]  Think of Cloward and Piven.
[00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:36.089]  They didn't invent governments destabilizing things for control, but they codified it into a strategy adopted by the Democrats by the early 70s.
[00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:49.837]  And that's where you overload, you make people dependent on government, you bankrupt the system to kill capitalism because people don't know how to take care of themselves anymore, and the system has again been overloaded, and then you offer them the new communist or socialist system as a solution.
[00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:51.858]  That's why Kamala wants price controls.
[00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:52.839]  Classic communism.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.841]  Always cuts production.
[00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:56.382]  Then that creates scarcity.
[00:06:56.522 --> 00:06:58.183]  Always creates even higher prices.
[00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:00.225]  They know what they're doing.
[00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:03.767]  They're not idiots that run a system that just ruins things.
[00:07:03.827 --> 00:07:06.529]  They just try it over and over again, hoping it's going to work next time.
[00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:14.795]  No, this is the purposeful destruction of a wide economy for the general public because the big central banks want vertical integration.
[00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:16.357]  The destruction of a general
[00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:17.756]  Thank you.
[00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:24.988]  It's all part of the larger situation that's unfolding.
[00:07:25.248 --> 00:07:28.669]  That's why it's so critical people understand what's happening or the globals will win.
[00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.051]  The good news is people are really starting to understand what's happening around the world.
[00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:36.913]  There's a lot of leaders popping up and referendums that are blocking this.
[00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:40.054]  There's major moves to break up Google and other big monopolies.
[00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:47.918]  And so we can prevail but only if we understand who the enemy is and how they're operating and how to stop them and then what to offer
[00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:51.642]  As a system instead of what they're bringing in.
[00:07:51.982 --> 00:07:58.109]  Not a technocracy, but a truly open free market civilization based on liberty and based on truth and justice.
[00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.511]  Thank you all for watching.
