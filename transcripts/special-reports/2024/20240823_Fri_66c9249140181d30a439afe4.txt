[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.656]  Robert F. Kennedy gave one of the most powerful and historic speeches I've ever seen.
[00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.722]  This was truly history-making.
[00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:13.486]  Everything he laid out was absolutely true.
[00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.549]  It was sincere, and he did it without a teleprompter.
[00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:23.658]  I told you back on Tuesday and broke the news that he would announce that he was endorsing President Trump this Friday.
[00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:26.419]  And Friday came, and sure enough, he did that.
[00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:33.203]  So the campaign was nice enough to give me a first look, and I appreciate the insider who gave me the information, because that gave us a chance to
[00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.045]  That's why I launched my campaign to unify America.
[00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:36.766]  My dad and my uncle made
[00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:22.107]  Such an enduring mark on the character of our nation, not so much because of any particular policies that they promoted, but because they were able to inspire profound love for our country and to fortify our sense of ourselves as a national community held together by ideals.
[00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:27.588]  They were able to put their love into the intentions and hearts of ordinary Americans.
[00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:30.889]  That's the spirit on which I ran my campaign.
[00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:34.464]  And that I intend to bring into the campaign of President Trump.
[00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.703]  And if you compare Kennedy's speech to Kamala Harris, how she was reading off a teleprompter, it was totally fake.
[00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:41.584]  It was totally canned.
[00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:47.368]  It was all about how much humanity she had, but none of her actions would actually empower humanity.
[00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:58.496]  He talked about the fact, and I can finish the sentences because the statistics are all public, that we had one in 1,500 children in the nineties with autism.
[00:01:59.157 --> 00:02:00.998]  And now we have one in 33 nationwide, one in 22 in California.
[00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.032]  The cancer rates for children in the U.S.
[00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:13.800]  are the highest in the world by an order of magnitude, that fatty livers are in massive numbers for our children, that our children are dying.
[00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:27.794]  I was just looking at a photo album from my grandmother that my dad had going through storage, going back to photos in the 1920s of her mother and her grandmother, and then right through until I was born in the
[00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:40.168]  The photo book ended when I was about six, and I just looked at how John Wayne-esque, but even more manly the men looked, and how beautiful and focused and clear-eyed the women were.
[00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:48.596]  And then I decided to dig out some of my old photo albums when I was growing up, and people looked so much more healthy, whether they're black, white, it didn't matter.
[00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:50.537]  There was so much more light in their eyes.
[00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:54.120]  The GMO, the big pharma,
[00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:55.853]  The cigarette makers.
[00:02:55.953 --> 00:02:57.254]  It's all the chemical companies.
[00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:58.495]  It's all mad scientists.
[00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:01.457]  It's all one big conglomerate, BlackRock.
[00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:02.417]  They're all interconnected.
[00:03:02.978 --> 00:03:09.943]  And they are literally poisoning us to death, addicting us while they take over the planet for their in-game population.
[00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:13.685]  A frontal military assault would have failed against America.
[00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:21.151]  But starting in 1945, they started putting deadly rat poison, insect poison, sodium fluoride in the water.
[00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.293]  And later they started adding hydrofluorosilicic acid that is the
[00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:36.563]  And that just broke yesterday.
[00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:39.945]  Of course, I talked about it 30 years ago when I first got on air.
[00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:45.430]  Back in 45, when they first started doing it, scientists, doctors went public and said, this is insane.
[00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.951]  This will give you cancer.
[00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:47.952]  This will give you infertility.
[00:03:47.972 --> 00:03:48.772]  This will lower IQ.
[00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:50.614]  They already knew that.
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:54.459]  They already knew that iodine was the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride.
[00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.226]  And if you added iodine to salt, people's IQs went up 15 points on average when they were growing up.
[00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.130]  But if you didn't have iodine, you would have mental midgets.
[00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.094]  So again, this was all known science then.
[00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:15.696]  And that was just one small area that he was covering today.
[00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:17.497]  The poison shots, all of it.
[00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:18.658]  Our fertility is plunging.
[00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:20.119]  Sperm counts are plunging.
[00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.379]  Cancer is exploding.
[00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.240]  We don't live as long.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.621]  World population is dropping for the first time since the Black Plague.
[00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:30.659]  You can't fake that type of sincerity and you can't fake how hard he's working.
[00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:36.323]  You can't fake the fact that he pledged when he first started running a few years ago that if it looked like he would be just a spoiler,
[00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.933]  Many months ago, I promised the American people that I would withdraw from the race if I became a spoiler.
[00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:56.296]  A spoiler is someone who altered the outcome of the election but had no chance of winning.
[00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:26.101]  In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory in the face of this relentless systematic censorship and media control.
[00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:40.426]  So I cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House.
[00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:43.707]  Furthermore, our polling consistently showed
[00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:57.514]  If I was staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats, with whom I disagree on the most existential issues.
[00:05:58.315 --> 00:06:01.516]  Censorship, war, and chronic disease.
[00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:09.059]  In about 10 battleground states, where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name.
[00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:13.141]  And I've already started that process and urge voters not to vote for me.
[00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:15.762]  It's with a sense of victory.
[00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:20.909]  And not defeat that I'm suspending my campaign activities.
[00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.650]  But now he doesn't get revenge.
[00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.814]  He gets justice to come back and deliver conservatively 6 to 10 points to Trump.
[00:06:28.594 --> 00:06:33.478]  He's going to stay on the ballot in blue states to pull Democrat votes, flipping some states red.
[00:06:34.258 --> 00:06:37.801]  And in red states, he is going to be not on the ballot as well.
[00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.842]  Or he told people not to vote for him.
[00:06:40.022 --> 00:06:43.225]  But in battleground states, he's pulled himself off the ballot.
[00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:44.285]  He's in the process right now.
[00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:46.067]  Pennsylvania, Georgia,
[00:06:47.153 --> 00:06:50.317]  Michigan, Arizona.
[00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.239]  So I talked to Roger Stone.
[00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.845]  He says it's a genius move to maximize the effect against the Democrats and all their fraud.
[00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.830]  They've got about a 10% margin of dead people and folks out of district to vote.
[00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.012]  That's about the ammunition they've got.
[00:07:04.873 --> 00:07:10.114]  Trump's already 10, 15 points ahead, 20 in some polls, about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in battlegrounds.
[00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:13.135]  This RFK is a bellwether.
[00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:14.615]  So is Tulsi Gabbard's joining.
[00:07:15.215 --> 00:07:16.556]  Trump is well on the campaign trail.
[00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:20.536]  He said he's going to join Trump on the campaign trail and try to unify America.
[00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:25.578]  And he said, because he hopes we love our children more than we love hating each other.
[00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:31.859]  Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country and our children
[00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:41.069]  The Democratic Party is the party of hurting the children.
[00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:45.691]  It's the party of sterilizing the children, and aborting the children, and toxifying the children.
[00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:48.832]  They are the party of the corporations in war and death.
[00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:50.493]  And I already liked RFK Jr.
[00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.514]  and had a good feeling about him, and told folks that I believed he was for real.
[00:07:53.994 --> 00:08:00.597]  He might have had some bad folks around him, but even his VP is now anti-communist, anti-globalist, anti-new world order.
[00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:03.627]  You've got Elon Musk joining in as well.
[00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:05.388]  And so much more.
[00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.873]  So now he'll make the rounds on all the top shows in the world from Tucker Carlson to Joe Rogan to you name it.
[00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:13.496]  Now he'll be on all the big campaign sites.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.400]  This is going to be huge.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:23.142]  And you look at the wonderful folks supporting Trump and all the authentic mavericks, male and female, old and young, black and white, Hispanic, you name it.
[00:08:23.482 --> 00:08:33.784]  On the other side, you see the Democrats, the party of division and hate and lies and fraud and fake job numbers and open borders and human trafficking and World War III.
[00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:38.885]  So it's to save the children from poison, Big Pharma, Big Agra, Big Food, it's all the same group.
[00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:44.270]  It's to stop World War III and it's to unify this nation.
[00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.515]  A beautiful, powerful message that makes me so proud of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:50.736]  We should support him.
[00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:52.378]  We should support President Trump.
[00:08:52.518 --> 00:08:57.984]  And I had already gone home today because we've been up here the last four nights covering the DNC until midnight almost every night.
[00:08:58.504 --> 00:08:59.845]  I'd left early at about four o'clock.
[00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:09.354]  And I got home, was with my family, and I looked at my seven-year-old daughter who wanted to play board games with me and play in the backyard and go swimming.
[00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:11.897]  And I said, baby, for you, I got a turnaround.
[00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:15.900]  And I drove back up here to cut this because it is about the children.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.061]  It's all of our choices.
[00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:19.384]  It's what we do, not supporting these companies.
[00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:21.585]  But they're trying to force feed it through the system.
[00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:26.049]  They're trying to shut down organic farms all over the world, not just here, saying they're bad.
[00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:28.891]  And they're trying to feed you frankenfood, Bill Gates.
[00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:41.421]  But if we get a regulator like him in at the FDA or at the EPA, because we can call this food toxic waste as well, or he gets to be the director of the CIA or the attorney general, this is going to be so powerful.
[00:09:41.441 --> 00:09:42.001]  But I got to tell you,
[00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:51.928]  Trump and Kennedy have got to be really careful now because if the Deep State tried to kill Trump before and killed RFK's father and uncle, they are really going to try to kill them now because they're desperate.
[00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:56.470]  This isn't the 1960s when the corporate media had total dominance and air superiority.
[00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:00.753]  The corporate media is a discredited fraud and they will not get away with it this time.
[00:10:01.153 --> 00:10:02.834]  So I salute RFK Jr.
[00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:03.675]  I salute Trump.
[00:10:04.015 --> 00:10:11.200]  This is a big deal and Trump needs to put him front and center and he needs to follow through what Kennedy said he's told him personally.
[00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:18.213]  And what his family's told Kennedy that they agree that the food and the water and the shots are poison.
[00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:20.294]  You even heard that clip that leaked to Trump admitting it.
[00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:23.616]  He's just too big an ego to admit he got conned.
[00:10:23.637 --> 00:10:28.500]  And he has agreed to work with Kennedy to do this and that he wants to make it his legacy.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.623]  Trump wants to make it his legacy to take on this system.
[00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:34.565]  And Kennedy said, I believe him.
[00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:38.676]  So, we are about to see spectacular things happen.
[00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:52.087]  Thank God for this, and thank God for working through all of you, for your support of Trump and Kennedy and Infowars, because, you know, it goes Trump, Musk, Kennedy, and then, you know, Rogan, and Tucker Carlson, and then Alex Jones.
[00:10:52.187 --> 00:11:01.575]  I mean, and I'm not trying to be at the top of this, because it's so dangerous to be there, but I'm right there at the upper echelon of the top people the globalists hate, because we understand their operation and how to stop them.
[00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:04.937]  And so that's why your support of InfoWars is so critical.
[00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:06.217]  Follow us on expertalexjones.
[00:11:06.597 --> 00:11:07.477]  But this is amazing.
[00:11:08.517 --> 00:11:10.998]  We've got so many clips posted at InfoWars, a manned up video.
[00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:11.478]  Share them.
[00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:12.938]  Share the clips of the speech.
[00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:14.198]  Post your own clips of the speech.
[00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:16.379]  And this is just an amazing time to be alive.
[00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.519]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.439]  There's good as well.
[00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:20.959]  And we're going to save the children and our future together.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.200]  God bless you all.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.700]  And again, thank you for everything you've done.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.100]  I love you all from the bottom of my heart.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.721]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you just went from amazing in my book to just
[00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:32.203]  Top of the line, spectacular, as good as it gets.
[00:11:32.283 --> 00:11:38.527]  And I'll say the heartfeltness and the decency and everything he said, you know, top Trump's best speeches.
[00:11:38.587 --> 00:11:39.387]  It's not a competition.
[00:11:39.707 --> 00:11:44.390]  I'm just saying this was world-class, authentic, maverick, vanguard for humanity.
[00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.531]  This was Team Humanity.
[00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:47.092]  So we salute you, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:55.497]  The chronic disease crisis was one of the primary reasons for my running for president, along with ending the censorship in the Ukraine war.
[00:11:56.573 --> 00:12:04.315]  It's the reason I've made the heart-wrenching decision to suspend my campaign and to support President Trump.
[00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:12.337]  This decision is agonizing for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends.
[00:12:13.097 --> 00:12:16.378]  But I have the certainty that this is what I'm meant to do.
[00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:22.440]  And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.
[00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:35.699]  If I'm given the chance to fix the chronic disease crisis and reform our food production, I promise that within two years, we will watch chronic disease burden lift dramatically.
[00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:38.540]  We will make Americans healthy again.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.082]  Within four years, America will be a healthy country.
[00:12:43.082 --> 00:12:47.904]  We will be stronger, more resilient, more optimistic, and happier.
[00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:50.065]  I won't fail in doing this.
[00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:52.066]  Ultimately, the future
[00:12:52.594 --> 00:12:59.257]  However it happens is in God's hands and in the hands of the American voters and those of President Trump.
[00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:10.022]  If President Trump is elected and honors his word, the vast burden of chronic disease that now demoralizes and bankrupts the country will disappear.
[00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.103]  This is a spiritual journey for me.
[00:13:14.324 --> 00:13:19.846]  I reached my decision through deep prayer, through hard-nosed logic, and I asked myself
[00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:28.267]  What choices must I make to maximize my chances to save America's children and restore national health?
[00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:41.071]  I felt that if I refused this opportunity, I would not be able to look myself in the mirror, knowing that I could have saved lives of countless children and reversed this country's chronic disease epidemic.
[00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:43.492]  I'm 70 years old.
[00:13:43.512 --> 00:13:46.973]  I may have a decade to be effective.
[00:13:48.226 --> 00:13:56.872]  I can't imagine that President Harris would allow me or anyone to solve these dire problems.
[00:13:57.492 --> 00:14:04.277]  After 8 years of President Harris, any opportunity for me to fix the problem will be out of my reach forever.
[00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:08.720]  President Trump has told me that he wants this to be his legacy.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.482]  I'm choosing to believe that this time he will follow through.
[00:14:18.968 --> 00:14:20.309]  All support this objective.
[00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:32.657]  My joining the Trump campaign will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children, but worthwhile if there's even a small chance of saving these kids.
[00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:44.664]  Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country and our children is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.
[00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:49.940]  That's why I launched my campaign to unify America.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:15:12.869]  My dad and uncle made such an enduring mark on the character of our nation, not so much because of any particular policies that they promoted, but because they were able to inspire profound love for our country and to fortify our sense of ourselves as a national community held together by ideals.
[00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:40.597]  They were able to put their love into the intentions and hearts of ordinary Americans and to unify a national populist movement of Americans, blacks and whites, Hispanics, urban and rural Americans, inspired affection and love and high hopes and a culture of kindness that continued to radiate among Americans from their memory.
[00:15:41.823 --> 00:15:48.049]  That's the spirit on which I ran my campaign and that I intend to bring into the campaign of President Trump.
[00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.794]  Instead of vitriol and polarization, I will appeal to the values that unite us.
[00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:59.058]  The goals that we could achieve if only we weren't at each other's throats.
[00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:05.864]  The most unifying theme for all Americans is that we all love our children.
[00:16:06.845 --> 00:16:08.987]  If we all unite around that issue now,
[00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:15.407]  We can finally give them the protection, the health, and the future that they deserve.
[00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:17.387]  Thank you all very much.

[00:16:42.765 --> 00:16:45.006]  And raise your hand if you know what Event 201 was.
[00:16:46.627 --> 00:17:00.252]  Okay, for those of you who don't know, Event 201 was a pandemic simulation, a coronavirus pandemic simulation, in New York City, hosted by Bill Gates.
[00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:10.315]  And Avril Haines, the former deputy director of the CIA, who did all of the Guantanamo Bay cover-up.
[00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:11.876]  She is like the cover-up queen.
[00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:20.440]  They were working on ways to use the coronavirus pandemic as a pretense for clamping down totalitarian controls globally.
[00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:25.563]  George Gao and Avril Haines from the CIA
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:35.023]  They have a soliloquy about how do we clamp down and stop people from saying, this came from a lab leak.
[00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:41.046]  And they say, well, we got to get the social media companies to censor them and de-platform them and all this.
[00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:44.427]  You can go on YouTube and watch this tonight.
[00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:48.049]  It's called Event 201, and this is the fourth section of it.
[00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:54.371]  But then I started doing a deep dive when I was writing the book, and I found out that was not a one-off.
[00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.632]  And I describe in that book, I found
[00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:01.432]  About 20 of these that they had been doing since 2001.
[00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:06.555]  And they're all scripted by the CIA.
[00:18:06.575 --> 00:18:15.381]  And all of them include top-level officials like James Woolsey, the Deputy Director of the CIA, Taro Tull.
[00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:18.824]  All of them have senior CIA officials.
[00:18:19.524 --> 00:18:24.708]  Many of them have famous people who kind of give an imprimatur of legitimacy to what they're doing.
[00:18:25.595 --> 00:18:30.316]  Like Madeleine Albright or Tom Daschle or, you know, Bill Gates and a lot of them.
[00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:34.597]  And Gro Bruntman from the, you know, from the WHO.
[00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:41.158]  They end up drilling, each one of them is drilling the imposition of totalitarian controls.
[00:18:41.198 --> 00:18:52.240]  They're collectively, they have names like Dark Winter and Crimson Contagion and all these weird names, but collectively they're called Operation Lockstep.
