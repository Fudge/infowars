[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:26.337]  Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a 30-year global project of private banks and governments working with big tech to wire every device on earth into an AI system that's used to control the world population through central bank digital currencies and a universal basic credit score that penalizes you for your political and religious beliefs or simply the lifestyle you lead.
[00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:39.821]  And now the public has begun to awaken to the fact that when they go update their phones or update their smart cars, they're being told that the government and corporations are tracking you, controlling you, and will decide when and where you can go in your car.
[00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:42.122]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond dangerous.
[00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:43.782]  We're about to break it down right now.
[00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:52.705]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:03.246]  I've been warning you for decades about this, but that was when this was all in beta testing mode.
[00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.868]  Now it's going operational.
[00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:18.497]  People all over the world are noticing that the meters in their house and the controls for their air conditioning and heating are being remotely controlled by smart meters on the side of their house.
[00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:26.643]  And people are getting messages that, hey, we're turning off your air conditioning or your heat or we're controlling the temperature because we're in a peak time right now and there's not enough energy.
[00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:30.006]  Which is why Tony Tallarico tried to crank up the A.C.
[00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:33.910]  I mean it was 90 out and it was right during the peak period.
[00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.373]  That's when he found out he had no control of his thermostat.
[00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:43.079]  A message from Xcel on his thermostat saying temperature locked during an energy emergency.
[00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:54.462]  Now, the UN, the WF, they've all admitted for years that under the new carbon austerity, they're going to cut the energy supply where there's not enough energy and train you to be rationed.
[00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.864]  But it's way worse than just the smart meters.
[00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:02.510]  All of the cars in the Western world, from Australia to the United States, the governments have passed the same laws.
[00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.852]  They passed it last year here in the U.S., Biden did.
[00:02:05.493 --> 00:02:06.494]  It was his bill he supported.
[00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:19.854]  Where trackers are in your cars that are also kill switches that control everywhere you go and what you do and can turn your car off or tell you where you can go in your car with geofencing, just like drones can't fly.
[00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:27.238]  I'm going to talk to you about a smart feature called geofencing, which makes driving in low emission zone even easier.
[00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:37.123]  When your vehicle enters a control area, such as a low emission zone, the system will automatically switch to all electric drive mode.
[00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:40.006]  Vehicle tracking features of Suzuki Connect.
[00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:47.375]  First off, with the live vehicle tracking features you can get real-time updates on your car's precise location.
[00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:52.561]  It helps you to clearly follow or see where your car is at all times when it's moving.
[00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:56.526]  What's even more interesting is you can also define a particular area
[00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:14.882]  And now in Germany, they've announced this summer they plan on banning people using their cars during the weekends to cut carbon and to follow the UN treaty.
[00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:21.708]  I'm going to show you an example of one man who shows you the computer terminal on his smart car where he went
[00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:31.440]  took it in to get it serviced and then he was given the update that now they may turn his car off or decide where he can go when he can go.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a technocracy, a form of government where a ruling bureaucratic system via government and big tech
[00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:51.277]  Through all of these computers that are embedded in every appliance, you name it, control and track where you go and what you do, and it's all integrated into your social credit score.
[00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.978]  China's about five years ahead of the West.
[00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:55.319]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:07.398]  It's not technology itself that is bad, it's that all the technology, including the smartphone in your pocket, has been deployed to track you, to censor you, to control you.
[00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:11.622]  And they're now setting up geofencing systems where they can hit one button,
[00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:21.885]  And turn off a whole city cell phones or only select groups phones where your phone won't work, or it won't shoot video, or it simply turns off when you go into certain areas.
[00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:26.207]  They've been testing this for decades, but now it's all rolling out.
[00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.248]  It broke in Congress last week, what I told you a decade ago.
[00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:35.110]  The IRS is using AI to track all your financial purchases that are digital and to track your bank accounts.
[00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:45.321]  So this was something that was discovered by an undercover journalist and what they found is that the IRS has claimed that they have access to every single person's bank account.
[00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:55.271]  This person also indicated that they've been working with the Department of Justice and that they have absolutely no problem whatsoever going after the little guy to make sure that they are paying their taxes.
[00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.352]  And some will say, well, nothing to hide, I don't care.
[00:04:57.432 --> 00:05:11.419]  No, it is a predatory system using this for the top corporations that gather all this data through their operations and through government to integrate it into AI systems to game the economy and vertically integrate the system.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.340]  I'm not against driverless cars.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:23.866]  I'm not against all this technology, but it's being deployed day one to remove humans out of the power equation with a global digital dictatorship.
[00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:25.376]  Here's one example.
[00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:46.703]  We're talking about anything with an SOS button.
[00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:47.264]  My wife's car is a 2016.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.145]  They can set range limits and time limits remotely.
[00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:12.572]  Terms say it's not used without consent unless required by law.
[00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:14.734]  The last sentence voids the whole thing.
[00:06:15.255 --> 00:06:16.316]  I want to be 100% clear.
[00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:20.141]  This is an official plan by the major corporations of the planet
[00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:23.304]  This is feudalism on steroids and it's happening now.
[00:06:40.057 --> 00:07:01.792]  And it's very important to note that members of Parliament in Europe and members of our Congress in the United States are so technically ignorant themselves they still don't even understand the fact that for decades all cell phones are tracked in live time and the heads of big tech have even lied to them in Congress because it's like someone from the future talking to a caveman
[00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:04.373]  They are so easy to fool and control.
[00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:14.261]  It is the intelligence agencies, big tech, and the larger corporations that have deployed this system, and the governments themselves have become ceremonial and vestigial.
[00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:31.433]  We have to take back control of our lives, we have to take back control of technology, and we have to do everything we can with legislation and lawsuits to have these illegal tracking systems and control systems removed, and at the same time have mitigating systems where we have older automobiles and other systems that don't
[00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:42.818]  have all of this tech wired into them so we can fight it at the grassroots by not complying or having the software wiped off your quote smart device or smartphone or smart car.
[00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:58.506]  But more important than that is simply legislatively banning this garbage because it's beyond Big Brother and it's absolute tyranny and it's been rolled out to again game and control and manipulate civilization towards a very evil end of the globalist endgame.
[00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:03.728]  The model for internet censorship is going to be phased in, Chinese-style net censorship.
[00:08:04.308 --> 00:08:08.309]  Net IDs, net taxes, three strikes and you're out net rules.
[00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:23.715]  But before they get to that, they're going to phase in, it started, starts this, next year, just, you know, ten days or so, or less, I guess nine days, in China, and they're already lining up with Facebook, Google, all of them agreeing with China.
[00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:31.881]  Microsoft to implement these systems where China already does it and then they beta test there and then bring in here.
[00:08:32.522 --> 00:08:46.316]  Everything you do in China from your credit score to what you buy to discount cards to your internet records to what you say on social networks is integrated into an algorithm and if you criticize the government basically once
[00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:48.469]  You can't even buy or sell.
[00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:49.510]  You can't get a hotel.
[00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.432]  You can't travel.
[00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:57.983]  Now, I knew this was coming, but to see it actually happen is so bold, is so over the top, that I get why people just can't believe it.
