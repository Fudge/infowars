[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.519]  We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.599]  Look what happened.
[00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:11.539]  Is this crazy?
[00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:23.219]  But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.160]  Nothing like this.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.120]  I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being here.
[00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.929]  Elected your 47th president and your 45th president.
[00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.070]  And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family.
[00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.990]  And your future.
[00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.649]  Every single day I will be fighting for you and with every breath in my body.
[00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.090]  I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve.
[00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.850]  This will truly be the golden age of America.
[00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.150]  That's what we have to know.
[00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.829]  This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again.

[00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.510]  Trump's not on stage.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.340]  We'll come back to Owen in a moment.
[00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.099]  Let's go to this live feed right now.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.019]  Here it is.
[00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:40.959]  History happening right now.

[00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:47.560]  I want to stay in the fight.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.459]  I'm asking for your support.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.840]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:51.099]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.439]  Go to President Trump live right now.
[00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.579]  I love how my headset went out right when he went up.
[00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.040]  Here it is.
[00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:45.469]  From the leagues and in the suburbs To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas From sea to shining sea From Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A. Where there's pride in every American heart And it's time we stand and say Come
[00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.669]  next to you and defend her still today.
[00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.849]  Cause her rain flowed out by love this night.
[00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.180]  Thank you very much.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.560]  Wow.
[00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.539]  Well, I want to thank you all very much.
[00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.280]  This is great.
[00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.259]  These are our friends.
[00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:04.159]  We have thousands of friends in this incredible movement.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.960]  This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before.
[00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:18.860]  And, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.040]  There's never been anything like this in this country and maybe beyond.
[00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.610]  And now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our country heal.
[00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.089]  We're going to help our country heal.
[00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:39.250]  We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly.
[00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.370]  We're going to fix our borders.
[00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:43.990]  We're going to fix everything about our country.
[00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:50.170]  We made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that.
[00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.439]  We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.759]  And it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing.
[00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:01.839]  Look what happened.
[00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:02.779]  Is this crazy?
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.459]  But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.399]  Nothing like this.
[00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:19.379]  I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being here.
[00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.170]  Elected your 47th president and your 45th president.
[00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.310]  And every citizen I will fight for you, for your family.
[00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.209]  And your future.
[00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.410]  Every single day, I will be fighting for you.
[00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:50.329]  And with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe, and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve.
[00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.050]  This will truly be the golden age of America.
[00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.370]  That's what we have to know.
[00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:09.040]  This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.240]  And in addition to having won the battleground states of North Carolina, I love these places.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.620]  Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
[00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:38.269]  We are now winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Alaska, which would result in us carrying at least 315 electoral votes.
[00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:51.110]  But it's much easier doing what the networks did, or whoever called it, because there was no other path.
[00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.730]  There was no other path to victory.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.540]  We also have won the popular vote.
[00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.519]  That was great.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:11.220]  Thank you.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.519]  Thank you very much.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.019]  Winning the popular vote was very nice.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.839]  Very nice, I will tell you.
[00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.839]  It's a great feeling of love.
[00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:35.279]  We have a great feeling of love in this very large room with unbelievable people standing by my side.
[00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.579]  These people have been incredible.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.019]  They've made the journey with me.
[00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:42.850]  We're going to make you very happy.
[00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:44.689]  We're going to make you very proud of your vote.
[00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:57.790]  I hope that you're going to be looking back someday and say that was one of the truly important moments of my life when I voted for this group of people beyond the president, this group of great people.
[00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:07.930]  America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.
[00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.810]  We have taken back control of the Senate.
[00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.209]  Wow, that's great.
[00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:36.870]  And the Senate races in Montana, Nevada, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, were all won by the MAGA movement.
[00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.309]  They helped so much.
[00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:46.080]  And in those cases, every one of them, we worked with the senators.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.200]  They were tough races.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.679]  And I mean, the number of victories in the Senate was absolutely incredible.
[00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.840]  And we did tele-rallies.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.919]  We did tele-rallies with each one of them.
[00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.059]  And sometimes we did two or three.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.259]  And it was amazing to look at all of those victories.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.539]  Nobody expected that.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:03.980]  Nobody.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.059]  So I just wanted to thank you very much for that.
[00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:11.519]  And you have some great senators and some great new senators.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.580]  And it also looks like we'll be keeping control of the House of Representatives.
[00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.960]  And I want to thank Mike Johnson.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.580]  I think he's doing a terrific job.
[00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:28.799]  Terrific job.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.279]  I want to also thank my beautiful wife, Melania, First Lady.
[00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:48.289]  Who has the number one best-selling book in the country.
[00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.309]  Can you believe that?
[00:09:49.990 --> 00:10:01.669]  Oh no, she's done a great job.
[00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.570]  Works very hard.
[00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.710]  Works very hard to help people.
[00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:12.090]  So I just want to thank her, but I want to thank my whole family, my amazing children, and they are amazing children.
[00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:14.870]  Now, we all think our children are amazing.
[00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:20.669]  Everybody here thinks their children are amazing, but that's a good thing when you think they are.
[00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:29.029]  But Don, Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, Barron, Laura, Jared, Kimberly, Michael, thank you all.
[00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:29.690]  What a help.
[00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.980]  My father-in-law, Victor, is tremendous.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.340]  And we miss very much Melania's mother, Amalia.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.019]  We miss Amalia, don't we, huh?
[00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.539]  She would be very happy right now standing on this stage.
[00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:51.500]  She'd be so proud.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.799]  She was a great woman, that one.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.659]  Beautiful inside and out.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.620]  She was a great woman.
[00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:25.879]  I want to be the first to congratulate Our great, now I can say, Vice President-elect of the United States, J.B. And his absolutely remarkable and beautiful wife,
[00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.139]  Ushabez.
[00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.490]  And he's a feisty guy, isn't he?
[00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.389]  You know, I've said, go into the enemy camp.
[00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:41.169]  And you know, the enemy camp is certain networks.
[00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.450]  A lot of people are like, sir, do I have to do that?
[00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:46.649]  He just goes, okay.
[00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:53.309]  Which one, CNN, MSDNC? He'll say, all right, thank you very much.
[00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:56.110]  He actually looks like, he's like the only guy I've ever seen.
[00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.289]  He really looks forward to it.
[00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.110]  And then he just goes and absolutely obliterates them.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.139]  Say a couple of words.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.139]  Well, Mr.
[00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:27.980]  President, I appreciate you allowing me to join you on this incredible journey.
[00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:30.340]  I thank you for the trust that you've placed in me.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.259]  And I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:51.500]  And under President Trump's leadership, we're never going to stop fighting for you, for your dreams, for the future of your children.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:13:00.639]  And after the greatest political comeback in American history, we're going to leave the greatest economic comeback in American history under Donald Trump's leadership.
[00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:09.889]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:13.230]  He's turned out to be a good choice.
[00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.429]  I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was...
[00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:24.110]  I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets.
[00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:32.289]  And we love the family, and we're going to have a great four years, and we're going to turn our country around, make it something very special.
[00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:35.929]  Lost that little...
[00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.830]  It lost that little, uh...
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.320]  That little thing called special, we have to make it so, we're gonna make this so great.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:53.320]  It's the greatest country, and potentially the greatest country in the world by far, and right now we're gonna just work very hard to get all of that back.
[00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:55.860]  We're gonna make it the best it's ever been.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.620]  We can do that.
[00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:02.139]  We just, if we had to wait longer, I don't know, it was going bad, and it was going bad fast.
[00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:07.059]  We're gonna have to seal up those borders, and we're gonna have to let people come into our country.
[00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:18.830]  We want people to come back in, but we have to let them come back in, but they have to come in legally.
[00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.450]  They have to come in legally.
[00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:28.350]  Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie and Chris, the job you did.
[00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:30.789]  Come, Susie.
[00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.470]  Come here.
[00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:32.889]  Come here, Susie.
[00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:33.370]  Chris.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.320]  Come here, Chris.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.139]  Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you.
[00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:40.480]  The Ice Baby.
[00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.740]  We call her the Ice Baby.
[00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:44.460]  Come here, Chris.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.980]  Come here, Chris.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.039]  Susie likes to stay in the background.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.179]  She's not in the background.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:53.759]  Come here.
[00:14:57.429 --> 00:15:01.870]  This wasn't expected, but I just want to thank, obviously, President Trump for this journey.
[00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.529]  It was a great one, and he's a hell of a candidate, and he's going to be a hell of a great 47th president.
[00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:14.929]  And this team that we had, the best team, and, of course, even my boss, Susie Wiles, the best.
[00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:15.710]  Thank you.
[00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.029]  Thank you, and thank you, Susie.
[00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.110]  Look at her.
[00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:23.549]  She's shot.
[00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.110]  I've never seen her be shot before.
[00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:26.470]  Susie.
[00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.690]  They're great.
[00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.190]  Everybody up here is great.
[00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:32.090]  Everybody up here is very special.
[00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.169]  But the Trump...
[00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.929]  Who did you say?
[00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:41.230]  Oh, let me tell you, we have a new star.
[00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.509]  A star is born, Elon.
[00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.490]  Now he is.
[00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:50.870]  Now he's an amazing guy.
[00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:52.389]  We were sitting together tonight.
[00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.990]  You know, he spent two weeks in...
[00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.769]  Philadelphia and different parts of Pennsylvania campaigning.
[00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.970]  You know, he sent the rocket up two weeks ago, and I saw that rocket, and I saw it coming down.
[00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:06.750]  I saw it.
[00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:09.789]  When it left, it was beautiful, shiny white.
[00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:12.129]  When it came down, it didn't look so pretty.
[00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:15.169]  It was going 10,000 miles an hour, and it was burning like hell.
[00:16:15.529 --> 00:16:17.370]  I said, what happened to your paint job?
[00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.570]  He said, we've never made a paint that could withstand that kind of heat.
[00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:24.460]  But I saw it come down and turn around.
[00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:28.019]  It's like 22 stories tall, by the way.
[00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:30.120]  It looks a little smaller than that, but it's big.
[00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:35.120]  And it came down and down, and you saw that fire burning.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.360]  And I said, only Elon can do this.
[00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:39.320]  It must be an Elon.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.879]  And I tell the story.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.139]  I told it last night.
[00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:43.659]  I had a man on the phone.
[00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:46.789]  I had the screen muted, no sound.
[00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:55.549]  I was talking to a very important man, happens to be here, and that very important guy, one of the most important people, and I would say the country, actually.
[00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:04.230]  But, you know, I was president, and now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again, so I figured I could ask him to hold.
[00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:06.589]  So I asked him to hold.
[00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.650]  And because, especially because you're going to be president again, they polled.
[00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.910]  So I took the phone down and I'm looking at the screen, I'm seeing this crazy thing that's going around and coming down.
[00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:19.230]  It looks like it's a crash into the gantry.
[00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.250]  And I said, oh no!
[00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.849]  And I said, do me a favor, do you mind holding for a couple of minutes?
[00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:24.569]  I want to see this.
[00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.569]  I thought it was a space-age movie or something.
[00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.190]  I put the phone down.
[00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:30.549]  Bad point.
[00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.549]  I didn't pick it up for 45 minutes and he was holding.
[00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:50.529]  But this spaceship came down, and I saw those engines firing, and it looked like it was over, it was gonna smash, and then I saw the fire pour out from the left side, and I put it straight, and it came down so gently- That's a metaphor for the world in America.
[00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:55.430]  And it held it, and just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby.
[00:17:56.569 --> 00:18:02.029]  And it was a beautiful thing to see, and I called Elon, I said, Elon, Was that you?
[00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.150]  He said, yes, it was.
[00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.809]  I said, who else can do that?
[00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:07.829]  Can Russia do it?
[00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.130]  No.
[00:18:08.369 --> 00:18:09.289]  Can China do it?
[00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:09.650]  No.
[00:18:10.609 --> 00:18:13.029]  Can the United States do it other than you?
[00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.329]  No.
[00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:14.569]  Nobody can do that.
[00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.509]  I said, that's why I love you, Elon.
[00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.150]  That's great.
[00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:28.190]  And you know, when we had the tragic hurricane Helene, and it hit, in particular, it hit North Carolina, they were really devastated the world.
[00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.180]  I said, what's Starlink?
[00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.829]  It's a form of communication.
[00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:55.190]  So I called Elon, and I'll tell you what, he had, and it was very dangerous.
[00:18:55.289 --> 00:18:55.829]  People would die.
[00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.910]  They had no communication.
[00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.150]  All the wires were down.
[00:18:58.269 --> 00:18:59.950]  I called Elon Musk.
[00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:03.109]  I said, Elon, you have something called Starlink.
[00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.710]  Is that right?
[00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:04.369]  Yes, I do.
[00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.250]  What the hell is it?
[00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:09.049]  He said, it's a communication system that's very good.
[00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.450]  I said, Elon, they need it really, really badly in North Carolina.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.819]  Can you get it?
[00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:16.319]  He had that there so fast.
[00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:17.240]  It was incredible.
[00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:18.720]  And it was great.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.039]  It saved a lot of lives.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.400]  He saved a lot of lives.
[00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:23.140]  But he's a character.
[00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:24.119]  He's a special guy.
[00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.099]  He's a super genius.
[00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:27.180]  We have to protect our geniuses.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.700]  We don't have that many of them.
[00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:29.599]  That's right.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.880]  We have to protect our super geniuses.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.140]  I want to thank some of the guys.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.220]  You know, we have up here today the U.S. Open champion.
[00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.740]  He's fantastic.
[00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:39.380]  I'll be slightly longer than me.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.920]  It's a little bit longer than me.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.559]  Just a little bit.
[00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:44.759]  Bryson DeChambeau is up here someplace.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.259]  What happened to Bryson?
[00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.420]  Where is he?
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.180]  Bryson.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.859]  Oh, he was shot.
[00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:59.920]  Notice Trump is being very friendly, very nice.
[00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.779]  Nothing about his victory over the Satanists trying to put him in prison.
[00:20:03.339 --> 00:20:06.480]  Even though he'll be back tomorrow trying to put him in prison, impeach him.
[00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:08.740]  Oh, look at him.
[00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:10.779]  Oh, he got the murdered out hat.
[00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:13.329]  And yeah, keep us on air.
[00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.710]  We'll shut down next week, probably.
[00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:17.109]  Please get your murdered-out hat, theolishowstore.com.
[00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:17.890]  Can't do without you.
[00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:19.849]  I mean, you don't defend us.
[00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:20.710]  Standing up for you.
[00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.430]  Fine, you might as well join the enemy.
[00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:25.430]  And we also have a man, Dana White, who has done some good.
[00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.170]  And who opened up the country with lockdowns.
[00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.529]  That's good.
[00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:31.910]  He's that tough guy.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.500]  So Dana started UFC and came to me.
[00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:43.859]  Do you mind if I use your...
[00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:47.640]  Nobody wanted to give them a rinse because they said it's a rough sport, a little rough.
[00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:54.150]  And I helped him out a little bit and I went and I said, this is the roughest sport I've ever seen.
[00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:57.190]  But I began to like it and he loved it.
[00:20:57.309 --> 00:21:00.329]  And nobody's done a better job in sports.
[00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:04.730]  And you know, he's a very motivational kind of a guy, what he does.
[00:21:04.869 --> 00:21:07.890]  He gets these fighters and they really go at it.
[00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.329]  And it's become one of the most successful sports enterprises anywhere at any time.
[00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:13.630]  It's doing so well.
[00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:17.930]  I'd like to ask Danny just to say a couple of words because people love to hear from him.
[00:21:21.109 --> 00:21:27.410]  They know I said they're gonna try to complete their coup, which of course we were saying every five seconds, but it doesn't matter.
[00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.789]  Nobody deserves this more than him and nobody deserves this more than his family does.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.559]  This is what happens when the machine comes after you.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.880]  What you've seen over the last several years, this is what it looks like.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.299]  Couldn't stop him.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.599]  He keeps going forward.
[00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:42.539]  He doesn't quit.
[00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:45.740]  He's the most resilient, hardworking man I've ever met in my life.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.539]  His family are incredible people.
[00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.359]  This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:50.579]  He deserves this.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.200]  They deserve it as a family.
[00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.180]  Hard time with the rise of America.
[00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:54.819]  The rebirth.
[00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:56.579]  I want to thank some people real quick.
[00:21:56.759 --> 00:22:06.859]  I want to thank the Nelt boys, Aiden Ross, Theo Vaughn, Bustle With The Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan.
[00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:10.819]  And thank you, America.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:11.660]  Thank you.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.319]  Have a good night.
[00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.279]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.180]  That is a piece of work.
[00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:23.099]  Do what must be done, would they not?
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.880]  Show no mercy.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.859]  And go to the endless city.
[00:22:33.809 --> 00:23:04.279]  Thank you so much together and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory like really I probably like no other this was something this was something special and we're gonna we're gonna pay you back we're gonna do the best job we're gonna we're gonna turn it around it's got to be turned around it's got to be turned around fast and we're gonna turn it around we're gonna do it in every way with so many ways but we're gonna do it in every way this will Forever be remembered as the day the American people regained
[00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.940]  control of their country.
[00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:06.380]  Yep.
[00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:11.660]  Independence Day 2.0 is November 6th.
[00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:13.220]  That's when it happened.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.140]  On behalf of this great group of people, these are hard-working people.
[00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:19.299]  These are fantastic people.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.440]  And we can add a few names like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.359]  He came in.
[00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:30.769]  And he's going to help Make America healthy again.
[00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:40.450]  I know listeners are holding.
[00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.049]  Trump came out at 1.27.
[00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:46.410]  Like I said, I got the time zone wrong, but I just nailed it.
[00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:48.809]  I said, God tells me 1.27.
[00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:49.769]  It was nailed.
[00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:51.430]  But not me.
[00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:52.009]  That's God.
[00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.130]  A little sign God gives us.
[00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.269]  We'll go to your calls as soon as Trump's done.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.700]  But here comes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:03.000]  We have more than Russia.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.539]  Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.299]  Other than that, go have a good time, Bobby.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.680]  See, he disarms the conservatives and stuff like that, and now we can get rid of the poisoned food and everything and the vaccines.
[00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.730]  We're good to do things that nobody else can do.
[00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.390]  Nobody else is going to be able to do it.
[00:24:19.809 --> 00:24:21.349]  China doesn't have what we have.
[00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.670]  Nobody has what we have.
[00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:30.250]  By the way, nobody's talking about Kamala pulling a Hillary and not giving a defeat speech and running off and hiding.
[00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.490]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.569]  I'll put down women.
[00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.150]  Women are great.
[00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.950]  Women I know are tough.
[00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:38.789]  What's up with Hillary eight years ago and now this running off and hiding?
[00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.910]  Kamala literally ran off and hid.
[00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:43.470]  I mean...
[00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.269]  Does she not realize how pathetic that looks?
[00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.390]  I mean, I was looking at it, I was watching it.
[00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.230]  They had some great analysis of the people that voted for us.
[00:24:55.289 --> 00:24:56.950]  Nobody's ever seen anything like that.
[00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:09.109]  They came from all quarters, union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American.
[00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:11.690]  We had everybody and it was beautiful.
[00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.690]  It was a historic realignment.
[00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:22.230]  Uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense.
[00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.329]  You know, we're the party of common sense.
[00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:39.560]  We wanna have borders, we wanna have security, we wanna have- They'll start a fight with the Russians that beat Napoleon and Hitler for no reason, and got 50,000 nuclear weapons, kinda like- Yeah.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:47.180]  Except we defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS in record time, but we had no wars.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.960]  They said he will start a war.
[00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:50.819]  I'm not gonna start a war, I'm gonna stop wars.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.740]  But this is also a massive victory for democracy and for freedom.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.819]  Together we're going to unlock America's glorious destiny.
[00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:03.980]  We're going to achieve the most incredible future for our people.
[00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.670]  See, the globalists say...
[00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.650]  Fade him down.
[00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.930]  Humans are bad.
[00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:10.990]  Humans are evil.
[00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.049]  We need to go away.
[00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.890]  You suck.
[00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:13.670]  Everything's failure.
[00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:14.690]  Trump's like, you're a winner.
[00:26:14.829 --> 00:26:15.529]  We're going to have success.
[00:26:16.569 --> 00:26:18.529]  The world, we can do everything with God.
[00:26:19.089 --> 00:26:20.670]  He needs to thank God in the speech.
[00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:21.410]  Maybe I missed it.
[00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.289]  I've been watching most of it.
[00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.589]  I went and took a little pee-pee earlier and got some water.
[00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.150]  But, I mean, has he thanked God yet?
[00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:28.730]  We need that.
[00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:29.089]  Please.
[00:26:29.849 --> 00:26:31.630]  Let's read our teleprompter half the time.
[00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.349]  Trump...
[00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:35.299]  God protected you from the attacker.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:40.759]  You already thanked him 100 times, but now, Trump, let's pray for Trump to thank God right now.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.619]  Let's all Trump thank God right now.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.099]  Thank the Creator, bring in the power of God now.
[00:26:48.819 --> 00:26:49.819]  He needs to do it.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.519]  Let's just, Trump do it.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.019]  Go ahead.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.640]  Back to him.
[00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:04.009]  And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.
[00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:07.970]  And now we are going to fulfill that mission together.
[00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.470]  We're going to fulfill that mission.
[00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:24.190]  The task before us will not be easy, but I will bring every ounce of energy, spirit, and fight that I have in my soul to the job that you've- Entrusting to me.
[00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.250]  This is a great job.
[00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.930]  There's no job like this.
[00:27:27.069 --> 00:27:30.309]  This is the most important job in the world.
[00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.509]  I just lost my audio feed.
[00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.269]  Just as I did in my first term.
[00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.990]  We had a great, great first term.
[00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.150]  I will govern by a simple motto.
[00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.990]  Promises made, promises kept.
[00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.450]  We're gonna keep our promises.
[00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:49.559]  Nothing will stop me from keeping my word to you, the people.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.740]  We will make America safe, strong, prosperous, powerful, and free again.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.660]  And I'm asking every citizen all across our land to join me in this noble and righteous endeavor.
[00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:01.579]  That's what it is.
[00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:07.599]  It's time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us.
[00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:08.839]  It's time to unite.
[00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:10.559]  And we're going to try.
[00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.400]  We're going to try.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.339]  We have to try.
[00:28:12.619 --> 00:28:14.119]  And it's going to happen.
[00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:15.839]  Success will bring us together.
[00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:16.740]  I've seen that.
[00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:17.680]  I've seen that.
[00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.559]  I saw that in the first term.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.539]  When we became more and more successful, people started coming together.
[00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:33.619]  Success is going to bring us together and we are going to start by all putting America first.
[00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.759]  We have to put our country first for at least a period of time.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.839]  We have to fix it.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.259]  Because together we can truly make America great again for all Americans.
[00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:47.220]  So I want to just I tell you what a great honor this is.
[00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:48.099]  I want to thank you.
[00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:49.579]  I will not let you down.
[00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:57.380]  America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than it has ever been before.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.259]  God bless you and God bless America.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.359]  Thank you very much.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.059]  Well, when history is happening, it is really amazing.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.359]  And the real fight is about to start.
[00:29:54.559 --> 00:30:00.059]  What I'm about to break down can benefit you in multiple ways, three different ways.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:16.799]  Number one, it will keep this transmission against the globalists that they absolutely hate on the air and will keep a broadcast and news information system That is credited by the most evil people on earth as being one of the main thorns in their side.
[00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:22.940]  So you keep us out there fighting for you, fighting for ourselves, fighting for our future when you get this product.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.099]  Now here's the other two big benefits.
[00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:37.880]  Everybody knows that CBD from the hemp plant is absolutely incredible, anti-inflammatory, great for mental clarity and focus, but also being relaxed at the same time.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.619]  Just so good for your immune system, all your cells, your whole body.
[00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:43.059]  It is a gift from God.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.680]  So everybody knows that.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.799]  Hell, medical doctors are prescribing it everywhere.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.460]  But then here's the other part, and this is the part you may not know.
[00:30:53.059 --> 00:31:04.259]  When you see the high-end 1,000-milligram CBDs out there, and they're retailing at 120 or 140 or 150 from your doctor, these are the discounted brands for $75.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.319]  That's about the market rate.
[00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.799]  That's a good deal compared to 120 or 150.
[00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:14.680]  But, ladies and gentlemen, there's a ton of markup in there.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.180]  One of the top manufacturers in the country that has scores of companies private labeling their highly rated product is owned by a listener.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:35.359]  And so I've been talking to them really for over a year, but in the last six months we got serious with one of my sponsors for them to go and private label them from them and for us to be authorized.
[00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:47.509]  To bring you the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high-quality CBD. So I want to introduce to you JonesCBD.com.
[00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:50.309]  JonesCBD.com.
[00:31:50.529 --> 00:32:03.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, this 1,000-milligram concentrated nanotincture, which means it's way more highly absorbable, Could easily retail for $120 and sell all day.
[00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:05.630]  And some people will pay more if they think it's better.
[00:32:05.849 --> 00:32:06.190]  No.
[00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:14.029]  This same CBD is sold by different people that probably label it from $140, $120, $75.
[00:32:14.769 --> 00:32:17.750]  Nobody, even when they discount it, is going below that.
[00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:20.769]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Ultra Green.
[00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:28.109]  This is a thousand milligram, high-end, nano-process, so it goes into the cells.
[00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:29.990]  Much better at the statistics here.
[00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:30.730]  It's on the website.
[00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.569]  And this is all documented, all certified.
[00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:40.369]  This is the best steel you're going to find anywhere, and it's only $47.95.
[00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:43.940]  And when you combo it, It's even less.
[00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:46.420]  So let me read some of the facts off here.
[00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:53.599]  It's nano-sized bioaventability, supercharged, delivering eight to nine times the absorption of standard formulas.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.319]  If you're done with watered-down, underpowered products, UltraGreen is here to bring you the real deal.
[00:32:59.819 --> 00:33:00.759]  Demand the best.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.839]  Grab Ultra Green Nano CBD at jonescbd.com today.
[00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:10.319]  And then there's another great product that's even less, $39.95.
[00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:17.799]  And it's got the Nano CBD in it and then a whole bunch of other known concentrated herbs that give you deep, restful sleep.
[00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:21.220]  And the CBD does that as well.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.619]  So I'm up to sell you on CBD. I'm up to sell you on supporting the broadcast.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.759]  All I'm asking you to do is to try this.
[00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.710]  And what do you have to lose?
[00:33:29.849 --> 00:33:30.869]  You've funded the broadcast.
[00:33:31.049 --> 00:33:31.650]  You're fighting tyranny.
[00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:43.269]  And when you get a great response from this CBD and you take it and it works better than CBD that costs twice as much or more, you're going to say, Alex Jones did not steer me wrong again.
[00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:48.230]  I didn't bring a silver or gold sponsor on until about 13 months ago.
[00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:50.450]  I've been in silver and gold for 30 years.
[00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.470]  For 12, I haven't promoted it because the silver and gold market was down.
[00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.670]  And most of the dealers were overcharging.
[00:33:57.809 --> 00:33:59.869]  So I didn't promote silver or gold for 12 years.
[00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:14.500]  When I knew it was going to explode, and I was sure of it, with all the indicators, as I read the economists' work across the board every day, I got a sponsor that's highly rated on, and silver, since he came on, is up almost 50%.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.940]  Gold's exploded as well.
[00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.920]  So, I don't steer you wrong.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:29.159]  And when I tell you that if you already like CBD, and most folks do and know how great it works, this is high-end, high-quality, at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.900]  This is just some of the products that are at jonescbd.com.
[00:34:33.099 --> 00:34:48.820]  We are very excited about this, and it is helping fund The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X and the studios, the satellite uplinks for radio and TV, the crew, the legal, everything we're doing.
[00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:50.400]  So it is a match made in heaven.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:35:03.800]  All you've got to do is go to jonescbd.com, buy the product, you support the broadcast, you win right there, you get it, and you take it, and you get a great experience.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.820]  It works great.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.340]  Believe me, I use it all the time.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.679]  My family uses it.
[00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:09.019]  And...
[00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.070]  Then I want you to do something else.
[00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.969]  If you've not known how good CBD was, you're going to go, this is great.
[00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:14.909]  You're into CBD now.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.960]  Go out and get one of the other brands that's even more money and then just see if this doesn't work better or just as good.
[00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:23.659]  Because this is high-end.
[00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:29.739]  The same company we're getting this from, people sell it for twice as much or more all day long.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.699]  Now again, if you are a CBD person, you'll know immediately when you take it that is high quality.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.099]  Now can you pay three times as much and get 3,000 milligram and even more concentrate?
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.320]  Yeah, but it becomes overkill.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.309]  So instead of taking, you know, Four or five drops of the super strong stuff.
[00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.869]  You take six, seven, eight drops of this, and it's just as good.
[00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.650]  You got a lower price.
[00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.289]  And again, 1,000 milligram is very high on the spectrum.
[00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:54.210]  It's already very strong.
[00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.690]  But to be honest, there's stuff even stronger out there.
[00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.530]  But this is high quality.
[00:35:57.789 --> 00:35:58.489]  It's nano.
[00:35:58.769 --> 00:35:59.929]  It funds the operation.
[00:36:00.269 --> 00:36:04.849]  This is, hands down, the best deal there is out there.
[00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:11.429]  So please visit jonescbd.com today and keep this transmission on one way or another.
[00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.010]  I humbly thank you.
[00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:21.789]  I respectfully thank you for what you've done because I can't do this without you and we are funding our operations against the globalists of retail sales.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:29.599]  And as you know, it's been all over the newspapers, have spent close to $80 million of lawsuits and garbage trying to shut us down the last seven years.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.980]  And because of your support, we have been able to fight them off and stay on air.
[00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:40.840]  But now is our most critical time to ensure that this new system is able to stay on air, regardless of what happens to Infowars.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.820]  So this is a time for action.
[00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.719]  And you don't just vote for Trump.
[00:36:45.389 --> 00:36:49.750]  You also support the independent organizations that are exposing the globalists.
[00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:55.110]  That's why they're obsessed with censorship because with the truth getting out there, their lies cannot stand.
[00:36:55.329 --> 00:37:04.590]  So get a great deal, empower your body, reduce inflammation, have a better immune system, enjoy all the great benefits of CBD and more.
