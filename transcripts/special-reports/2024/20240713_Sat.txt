[00:00:01.623 --> 00:00:02.544]  Take a look at what happened.
[00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:33.081]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been shot in an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.
[00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.642]  This is the footage you're seeing now.
[00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:36.143]  This was minutes ago.
[00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.184]  He has survived.
[00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.707]  He is in word that he's feeling fine.
[00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:44.088]  He's in a safe location.
[00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:47.651]  Again, this is the video of the incident.
[00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:55.536]  He was hit in the ear, as you'll be able to see in just a second, as the Secret Service
[00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:01.925]  Works to create a shield of bodies around him and usher him off the stage.
[00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:06.309]  Trump, meanwhile, in a state of shock.
[00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:17.058]  And then a defiant fist in the air as he attempts to get back to the podium.
[00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:23.064]  Joe Biden has just given a briefing from the White House.
[00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:23.604]  This is InfoWars.
[00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:25.944]  This is an emergency broadcast coming to you live from Austin, Texas, Saturday, July 13th.
[00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.525]  And we are in the middle of a historic event here.
[00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:52.513]  Obviously words fail me at this point, but we will be hearing from Alex Jones soon.
[00:01:52.613 --> 00:02:01.736]  He was traveling and is on location on a mission right now, so he will be Skyping in with us just as soon as possible.
[00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:03.957]  I'm Harrison Smith here with Chase Geiser.
[00:02:04.537 --> 00:02:06.857]  Chase, what is the latest from Alex?
[00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:08.838]  Do you know what time he may be making an appearance?
[00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:10.979]  I think any minute we should be expecting him.
[00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.460]  I know that he's on the road and he's with Rob Dew, and I think he'll be joining us any minute.
[00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:18.731]  Okay, so we'll be hearing from Alex Jones just as soon as he calls in.
[00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:27.558]  We'll be bringing you all of the information we know as of now, and we'll be taking your calls and connecting it to a lot of knowledgeable people in the meantime.
[00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.162]  Owen Schroer also calling in in just a few minutes.
[00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:35.985]  Obviously, we have been predicting something like this for a very long time.
[00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:42.231]  As they've tried everything else, they have investigated Donald Trump, lied about Donald Trump,
[00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:45.828]  Invented entire hoaxes to bring down Donald Trump.
[00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.629]  Nothing has worked thus far.
[00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.790]  And it seems to me like they're resorting to assassination.
[00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.551]  I'd bring you the facts as we know it.
[00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:00.531]  This was in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:02.652]  It was at a fairground during a Trump rally.
[00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.312]  The shots were caught on tape.
[00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:10.053]  The shooter was almost immediately taken down.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.280]  Apparently.
[00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:15.462]  And one other person is deceased.
[00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:19.144]  A bystander who was behind the president at the time.
[00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:27.989]  Again, Trump is apparently in good spirits.
[00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:33.853]  He has sent out a notice to the press saying that he is fine, but he has a bloody ear.
[00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:36.154]  And in fact, guys, we can bring up some of the images from this.
[00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:48.998]  Just absolutely, I don't want to call them iconic, but historical images of a very dangerous time in American history.
[00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.141]  And we have some very, very interesting videos.
[00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:56.504]  In fact, I want to go to a video now right off the bat.
[00:03:56.524 --> 00:04:01.569]  This is a BBC interview with a guy who was outside of the security perimeter.
[00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:05.426]  And guys, just let me know whenever you pull this in.
[00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:07.107]  Of course, the crew is scrambling right now.
[00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:08.368]  Alex Jones out of town.
[00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:09.329]  Owen Troyer out of town.
[00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.012]  Both of them will be calling in momentarily, and we'll go to them as soon as possible.
[00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:18.596]  Again, if you're just tuning in, this is Harrison Smith here with Chase Geiser in this historic moment.
[00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:21.518]  Let's go now to this interview.
[00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:27.083]  It's a bit long, but this is an eyewitness interview of the shooting itself, as far as we can tell.
[00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:28.364]  Let's watch.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.902]  So we had a party here all day.
[00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:40.364]  You can see behind us the Brinkels Farm and Greenhouse here.
[00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:52.593]  We had a party and we all decided, hey, you know, when we hear Trump up there, we're going to walk up through the field, stand by the trees up there under the shade and listen to the rally, right?
[00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:54.635]  We couldn't see him, but we could hear him.
[00:04:56.144 --> 00:05:11.429]  So we walked up and probably five to seven minutes of Trump speaking, I'm estimating here, I have no idea, you know, but we noticed a guy crawling, you know, bear crawling up the roof.
[00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:36.217]  of the building beside us 50 50 feet away from us so we're standing there you know we're pointing we're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof and he had a gun right he had a rifle he could clearly see him with a rifle absolutely um we're pointing at him the police are down there running around on the ground we're like hey man there's a guy on the roof with a rifle and the police were like huh what you know like
[00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:37.818]  Like, they didn't know what was going on.
[00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.840]  You know, we're like, hey, right here on the roof.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.881]  We can see him from right here.
[00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:41.622]  We see him.
[00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:43.223]  You know, he's crawling.
[00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:48.808]  And next thing you know, I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, why is Trump still speaking?
[00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:50.730]  Why have they not pulled him off the stage?
[00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.954]  I'm standing there pointing at him for, you know, two, three minutes.
[00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:57.776]  Secret Service is looking at us from the top of the barn.
[00:05:58.137 --> 00:06:00.939]  I'm pointing at that roof, just standing there like this.
[00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:04.866]  And next thing you know, five shots rang out.
[00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:06.271]  You almost shot me.
[00:06:06.613 --> 00:06:08.895]  But the shots came from that guy on the roof?
[00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:08.895]  100%.
[00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:12.377]  100%.
[00:06:10.196 --> 00:06:12.377]  And he was up there for a couple of minutes?
[00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:13.018]  He was up there.
[00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:14.279]  You saw him up there for a couple of minutes?
[00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:14.699]  Absolutely.
[00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.860]  At least three to four minutes.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.922]  And you were telling the police and the Secret Service?
[00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:18.982]  We were telling the police.
[00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:20.924]  We were pointing at him for the Secret Service.
[00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.106]  We were looking at us from the top of the barn.
[00:06:23.406 --> 00:06:25.568]  They were looking at us the whole time when we were standing by that tree.
[00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:26.288]  Could they see him?
[00:06:26.308 --> 00:06:27.109]  Binoculars.
[00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.809]  Could they see him?
[00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.890]  Probably not.
[00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.993]  Because the roof, the way the slope went, he was behind where they could see.
[00:06:33.874 --> 00:06:36.476]  But why is there not Secret Service on all of these roofs here?
[00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:38.646]  I mean, this is not a big place.
[00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:44.470]  Did you see, I mean obviously everyone, when the shooting started, everyone was very panicked.
[00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.831]  Did you see what happened to him at all?
[00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:47.232]  Oh yeah, they blew his head off.
[00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:48.673]  Okay, sorry.
[00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:49.954]  Secret Service blew his head off.
[00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:54.878]  Okay, just be careful because we don't know quite who's watching, but you're pretty sure they shot the guy?
[00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.438]  Absolutely, 100%.
[00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.439]  Yep.
[00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:57.820]  You saw that happen?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.940]  Yep.
[00:06:58.342 --> 00:06:58.522]  Yep.
[00:06:58.802 --> 00:06:59.162]  Okay.
[00:06:59.362 --> 00:06:59.522]  Yep.
[00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:02.463]  And did you see them go up to him afterwards or?
[00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:04.704]  They, yeah, they crawled up on the roof.
[00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:06.405]  They had their guns pointed at him.
[00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:07.285]  Make sure he was dead.
[00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:08.765]  He was dead and that was it.
[00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:09.346]  It was over.
[00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:11.606]  That's incredibly shocking.
[00:07:11.626 --> 00:07:13.147]  The guy was on the roof right there.
[00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:15.388]  You can see the white roof right there.
[00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:16.228]  Did you get a look at him?
[00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:16.648]  Could you?
[00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:17.869]  I, I, no.
[00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:18.849]  Other than he was in
[00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:23.228]  Muted colors, tan type clothing.
[00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.490]  We saw the rifle flinging around as he was trying to crawl.
[00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.831]  I mean, we saw the rifle, 100%.
[00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:29.772]  I mean, do you know about guns?
[00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:31.192]  Do you know what kind of weapon it was?
[00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:32.833]  Oh, I absolutely know about guns, for sure.
[00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.714]  I mean, it was a rifle of some sort.
[00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:40.737]  I wouldn't know, you know, I wasn't close enough to read the label on it, but it was a rifle of some sort.
[00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:42.438]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:45.940]  So what are you, how do you process what you've just seen?
[00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:49.732]  I don't know what to say, man.
[00:07:50.292 --> 00:08:02.578]  I'll tell you is, you know, if I walked up close to there with anything that Secret Service considered a problem, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you right now.
[00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:09.441]  But I don't know why a guy who we're standing there pointing out to police and Secret Service is crawling up the roof.
[00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:13.303]  Yes, right there by that tree.
[00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.547]  We were outside the security perimeter.
[00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:20.351]  But, my question is, there's only a few buildings around here.
[00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.533]  Why is Secret Service not on every building here?
[00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:26.156]  There's a whole bunch of questions I think that are gonna come.
[00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.717]  There's a whole bunch of questions.
[00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:31.120]  Yeah.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.781]  Yes, she was right in front of me.
[00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:34.402]  She kept going back and forth right in front of me.
[00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:35.003]  Yes.
[00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.044]  Tell us about her.
[00:08:38.425 --> 00:08:39.987]  I mean, nice horse.
[00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.168]  Nice lady running with a flag.
[00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:43.950]  Seemed very, you know,
[00:08:44.346 --> 00:08:44.626]  Patriotic.
[00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:46.709]  No, she's just, he asked me if I saw a horse.
[00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:46.890]  Gotcha.
[00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:01.729]  Alright, so that was an eyewitness at the rally.
[00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:04.391]  Again, this was a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:08.514]  It was at a fairground, so a wide open space, not a stadium per se.
[00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:16.159]  And according to him, there were eyewitnesses that could see a guy on a roof with a rifle, scaling up to the top of the roof.
[00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:23.844]  They were trying to make Secret Service and police aware of what was going on, but I guess the guy was on the other side of the roof from where they were.
[00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:26.586]  He says, there aren't many buildings with roofs like this.
[00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:32.387]  Saying it would, you know, would have been easy to have somebody on all of these roofs.
[00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:32.828]  There it is.
[00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:34.670]  Eyewitness pointed out.
[00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:36.912]  And he said for two or three minutes.
[00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:41.837]  And who knows how reliable that is, but obviously long enough for something to have been done.
[00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:44.260]  We told Secret Service before shots rang out.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.342]  Then Secret Service blew his head off.
[00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:51.485]  And there's actually images of that floating around of the guy laying on the roof.
[00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:55.087]  So this appears to have come from outside the immediate rally area.
[00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:58.008]  A lot of speculation as to what type of gun this is.
[00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:04.531]  I've heard speculation on mainstream media about ghost guns or 3D printed guns being able to sneak past security.
[00:10:05.952 --> 00:10:07.973]  It doesn't appear to have happened there.
[00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:11.515]  Again, if you're just joining us, this is an emergency broadcast.
[00:10:11.535 --> 00:10:15.597]  We'll be joined very shortly by Owen Schroer to get his comments on this.
[00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:23.416]  Alex Jones is on site, out of state, and will be joining us just as soon as we connect with him.
[00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:28.138]  He's been incommunicado, and what a day to be offline for a little while.
[00:10:29.138 --> 00:10:39.120]  An absolutely historic moment, as again we see, we could be sitting here, you know, but for a few millimeters, an inch at the most,
[00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:48.991]  Separates this timeline from the timeline where I'm sitting here showing you images of Donald Trump being shot in the head on live TV.
[00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:50.212]  I mean, he was.
[00:10:50.252 --> 00:10:55.836]  He was literally shot in the head, but thank God he has survived, and they say he is okay.
[00:10:55.976 --> 00:11:03.222]  Let's go ahead and watch the video again, and we can get quite a bit of information just from the video that we see.
[00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:09.720]  And the one called Trump shooting in TV during rally.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.462]  Let's go to that one here and we'll listen to the audio as well because you can hear exactly when the gunshots happen.
[00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:18.143]  You can see Donald Trump reach up and touch his ear as he gets struck.
[00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:29.228]  And interestingly, you can also see people looking to the left of the screen to their right just before the shots ring out, as does Trump.
[00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:40.179]  And again, we'll find out more about this as the information comes in, but let's go now to this video of Trump being shot in the ear live at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:42.620]  He touches his ear, and then more shots ring out.
[00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:58.978]  Now obviously if the shooter was killed, at least some of these shots are more coming, I believe.
[00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:01.539]  There's a shot there and a scream.
[00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:05.340]  So that, I imagine, was the Secret Service.
[00:12:09.574 --> 00:12:10.315]  Taking the shooter out.
[00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:11.956]  Just absolutely unbelievable.
[00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:13.838]  And again, Trump, you can tell, you just can't even believe it.
[00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:16.580]  Like, he gets shot in the ear and he's like, did that happen?
[00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:19.682]  And that pause alone could have killed him.
[00:12:19.983 --> 00:12:24.106]  But it sounds like when he ducked down, the shooter was just desperately trying to make sure he got him.
[00:12:24.126 --> 00:12:27.049]  And then there was a little pause while they identified where the shots came from.
[00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:28.610]  And they just took out the shooter.
[00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.531]  Absolutely crazy.
[00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:32.613]  Owen Schroyer joins us from a remote location.
[00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:34.515]  Owen, thank you for joining us.
[00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:37.557]  I'm sorry you aren't here to cover this absolutely historic moment.
[00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:38.318]  What do you know?
[00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:40.761]  Wow.
[00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.521]  I mean, there's so much to get into.
[00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:46.082]  I'm glad InfoWars is on air on this historic day.
[00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:49.863]  I'm glad that I'm able to be here with you guys on this historic day.
[00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:54.004]  I'm glad that Alex didn't get his social media accounts taken so we can report on this.
[00:12:54.064 --> 00:13:00.965]  More than anything, I'm glad that Donald Trump, his head is still on his shoulders and his heart is still beating.
[00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:04.846]  And I'm being told, I'm being told
[00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:10.276]  That Donald Trump plans to attend the UFC fight tonight in Florida.
[00:13:11.077 --> 00:13:16.239]  I am being told that he is going to show up at the UFC fight tonight in Florida.
[00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:30.964]  Now again, there's so much incoming right now that it's kind of hard to even calculate everything and get everything sorted out, and we're going to get into it here, but can you imagine if Donald Trump shows up at the UFC fight tonight?
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:38.773]  That place might, the building might come down, the roof might collapse, that the whole thing is just going to be absolutely epic.
[00:13:40.314 --> 00:13:41.375]  And so where to begin?
[00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:46.297]  I mean, let's just first address, and I'm sure that you guys have been talking about this, I'm just joining you now.
[00:13:47.198 --> 00:13:58.964]  Let's first address the absolutely legendary, iconic moment of Donald Trump as Secret Service is trying to rush him off the stage saying, wait, wait,
[00:13:59.634 --> 00:14:09.216]  And then he stands there, defiantly, and then lifts his fist in the air triumphantly, with blood bleeding from his head, and says, Fight!
[00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:10.396]  Fight!
[00:14:10.476 --> 00:14:11.176]  Unbelievable.
[00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:12.716]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:14.077]  I mean, it sends chills.
[00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:16.537]  I've probably watched it a hundred times.
[00:14:16.757 --> 00:14:22.058]  I mean, it's one of the most inspiring things I think I've ever seen in my life, to be quite frank with you.
[00:14:22.938 --> 00:14:26.979]  And as I'm watching this, and watching this, and watching this,
[00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:30.156]  This sense of pride comes over me.
[00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:32.136]  This inspiration comes over me.
[00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:38.038]  I've never been more proud of everything that I've gone through for Donald Trump.
[00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:47.080]  I've never been more proud of the fight that we've put in to save this country from what I saw from Donald Trump today.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.780]  It was truly magical.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.441]  It was the stuff of American lore.
[00:14:52.353 --> 00:15:07.123]  And you really do have to wonder, and I know we're all God-believing men here, we all believe in a divine creation, you do have to wonder what part the Creator, the Lord God, played in this today.
[00:15:08.363 --> 00:15:11.445]  Okay, so I mean that's just my initial response from the soul.
[00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:12.086]  Right.
[00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:16.989]  I think that, I'm hoping that, the
[00:15:18.121 --> 00:15:36.591]  If the centrist American or the apolitical American or the indifferent American sees this today and has a wake-up call, which is something we've known for a long time, the American left is the most dangerous thing our country faces today.
[00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:46.336]  And specifically, the Democrat Party is the largest terrorist organization in the history of the United States of America.
[00:15:47.378 --> 00:16:02.613]  And I think the fact that CNN, as an example—there are many of these examples, but we'll use CNN as an example right now—the fact that CNN is not even willing to call this an assassination, the fact that CNN's breaking news won't even say shooting,
[00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:08.052]  They just say Trump roshed up the stage, they just say incident, they won't even say shooting.
[00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:09.233]  They say he fell.
[00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:10.013]  This is wild, yeah.
[00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:14.057]  Sorry to interrupt, Owen, but this is probably the craziest part.
[00:16:14.137 --> 00:16:22.725]  Even President Biden, as far as I know, and we were just going live when his announcement was made, maybe we can go to that because it's pretty short, but I don't think he called this an assassination attempt.
[00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:24.126]  As far as I'm seeing.
[00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:24.746]  No, no.
[00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:28.208]  The statement I saw and heard, I just believe it was incident.
[00:16:28.308 --> 00:16:28.608]  An incident.
[00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:32.270]  I think was the word, the word they used in their press release was an incident.
[00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:32.811]  Incredible.
[00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:37.854]  Yeah, Joe Biden's, Joe Biden's response is only about two plus minutes, so we could play it.
[00:16:37.874 --> 00:16:38.954]  It wouldn't take much time.
[00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:44.638]  Well, let me say, DC Drano on X posted this scoop.
[00:16:45.058 --> 00:16:49.261]  Secret instructions given to news reporters telling them to play down Trump's assassination attempt.
[00:16:50.287 --> 00:16:51.008]  Trump rally story.
[00:16:51.048 --> 00:16:51.408]  Hello.
[00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:53.629]  Reminder to stick to facts.
[00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:56.551]  Don't speculate, editorialize, sensationalize, or jump to conclusions.
[00:16:56.952 --> 00:17:00.294]  Don't call it an assassination attempt unless authorities say it is.
[00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:04.477]  And I don't know whether this leak from DC Drano is valid or not.
[00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:11.942]  I do know that going to places like Google News and looking at the full coverage of the shooting at Trump rally in Pennsylvania,
[00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:13.918]  Trump injured in shooting.
[00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.020]  Trump in hospital following gunshots.
[00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.404]  Trump rushed off stage after loud noises.
[00:17:19.744 --> 00:17:22.307]  The headlines are not calling this an assassination attempt.
[00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.930]  They're not saying that Donald Trump was nearly killed by this.
[00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.291]  They are downplaying this.
[00:17:27.532 --> 00:17:29.193]  Unbelievably, they are actually
[00:17:30.094 --> 00:17:30.794]  Downplaying this.
[00:17:30.814 --> 00:17:31.134]  Yeah.
[00:17:31.154 --> 00:17:43.558]  One, the reports we're going to hear too are Trump calls for violence after, you know, attempted murder or something like that because he said the words fight, or they're going to say, they're going to be articles, how Trump's gun laws allowed the Pennsylvania shooter to bring a rifle to the rally.
[00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:45.998]  Like it's going to be crap like that all week.
[00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:48.479]  They're going to blame Trump for his own assassination attempt.
[00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:50.339]  They probably are, but I don't think it's good.
[00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:51.400]  I don't think it's going to work, Owen.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.741]  People are seeing this video and they know, they know an assassination attempt when they see one.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.661]  Well, exactly.
[00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:02.890]  And so that gets me back to my point is that I hope the American people have this wake up call.
[00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:09.280]  You know, it was the shot heard around the world that arguably started the United States of America.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.983]  You know, there's a bunch of different moments.
[00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:12.447]  Thank you.
[00:18:28.802 --> 00:18:29.262]  I don't know.
[00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:47.712]  But I hope that they finally see the left for what it truly is.
[00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:49.173]  And I don't know.
[00:18:49.393 --> 00:18:53.955]  And look, this isn't about being partisan in a moment like this.
[00:18:54.475 --> 00:18:55.936]  But let's be perfectly clear.
[00:18:56.936 --> 00:19:07.321]  This is the first time in my life, this is the first time in my career of covering politics that a Democrat has ever condemned a violent act.
[00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:09.446]  First time ever.
[00:19:09.926 --> 00:19:12.708]  We've seen them riots from coast to coast.
[00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:20.172]  We've seen Democrats engage in riots coast to coast that have cost dozens of people their lives, billions of dollars, police in the hospital.
[00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:24.134]  We've seen assaults on people for wearing Trump hats in the streets.
[00:19:24.474 --> 00:19:36.040]  We saw a Republican baseball practice, an attempted mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice, and violence at Trump's inaugurations, violence at Trump rallies from leftists.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:46.803]  Not one time, not one time has a Democrat ever condemned violence until today when Barack Obama and Joe Biden did.
[00:19:47.263 --> 00:19:51.965]  First time I have ever seen that happen in my life.
[00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:55.966]  Well, you know what they do, Owen, and it's the same thing that Nancy Pelosi did in this circumstance.
[00:19:56.406 --> 00:20:00.688]  They say, they respond to it in an unspecified sort of way, because you're exactly right.
[00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:11.952]  This is by no means the first attempted assassination of Republican politicians, including the attempted mass murder of Rand Paul and others at that softball practice.
[00:20:12.512 --> 00:20:13.513]  We're good to go.
[00:20:30.152 --> 00:20:31.852]  Well, I know you guys have been in studio
[00:20:56.736 --> 00:21:00.158]  I know you guys have been in studio and reporting on this live.
[00:21:00.198 --> 00:21:02.619]  I'm just joining you now about, you know, five, ten minutes ago.
[00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:11.542]  But I don't know if you've been seeing what the far radical left is saying on the internet right now and on spaces like X and Reddit and others.
[00:21:11.823 --> 00:21:13.423]  They're saying the whole thing is a hoax.
[00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:14.364]  I'm not even kidding you.
[00:21:14.384 --> 00:21:14.844]  Yeah, that's their plan.
[00:21:14.864 --> 00:21:17.025]  They're claiming the entire thing was staged.
[00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:19.566]  They're also claiming that
[00:21:22.161 --> 00:21:27.085]  First of all, the claim that it staged is ludicrous on its face because a man, the shooter, is dead.
[00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:33.070]  And then there was, I believe it was a woman, I think, that got shot, that took the stray bullet, and is dead as well.
[00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:35.212]  Again, this is all incoming information.
[00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:37.654]  I hope that that is accurate.
[00:21:37.674 --> 00:21:38.295]  But the point is,
[00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:40.276]  We know that this wasn't staged.
[00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:49.500]  And so to come out and start claiming this was staged, and then they're saying, oh, it was staged so that Trump and Republicans could assume power and change the narrative.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.300]  Yeah, of course.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:50.881]  What?
[00:21:50.941 --> 00:21:52.862]  I mean, this is truly psychotic stuff.
[00:21:53.182 --> 00:21:57.764]  Let me interrupt you there, Owen, because Donald Trump has just posted a response to this on Truth Social.
[00:21:57.804 --> 00:22:04.567]  He says, quote, I want to thank the United States Secret Service and all of law enforcement for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:22:04.947 --> 00:22:11.249]  Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured.
[00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:14.550]  It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.
[00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.410]  Nothing is known at this time about the shooter who is now dead.
[00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:20.731]  I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.
[00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:28.353]  I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.
[00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:32.815]  Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what had happened.
[00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:33.715]  God bless America.
[00:22:34.435 --> 00:22:35.076]  Absolutely.
[00:22:36.818 --> 00:22:37.940]  Absolutely mind-blowing stuff.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.343]  So there's the response from Trump.
[00:22:41.815 --> 00:22:48.200]  I can't imagine how he's feeling right now, and I'm also seeing the reports that he's planning to go to the UFC.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:23:04.993]  He has to still be in a sort of state of shock, and you can see in the video there, before he raised his fist and sort of, I think, got his head on back straight, he's saying, my shoes, my shoes, I need to get my shoes, which obviously, I mean, this is something that you see in car crashes or anything, where people will
[00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.592]  I'd go into shock and start saying things like, oh, I need my shoes.
[00:23:09.632 --> 00:23:11.234]  And it's like, sir, you're under attack right now.
[00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:12.054]  You need to get out of the way.
[00:23:12.134 --> 00:23:17.339]  But I just can't imagine the psychological terror that not just Trump, but his family is going through right now.
[00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.021]  Think about Barron and Eric and Donald Trump Jr.
[00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:29.168]  and Melania and all of these people having just seen this literally millimeters away from death as this bullet goes by.
[00:23:29.488 --> 00:23:32.370]  Have you been able to look at the video much, Owen?
[00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:37.387]  I really don't want to speculate, and we're not going to do a lot of speculation here.
[00:23:37.468 --> 00:23:47.258]  We're going to wait until the facts are in, and we'll go to any official reports, any official press conferences that law enforcement or Secret Service choose to give, or any politicians like Joe Biden.
[00:23:47.278 --> 00:23:50.722]  We'll go to that video here in just a second, but we're not going to speculate.
[00:23:51.002 --> 00:23:55.667]  But I will say, listening to the video, it sounds like a smaller caliber gun.
[00:23:57.055 --> 00:24:07.561]  It does sound like almost the shooter realizes he misses and frantically tries to shoot more and more and never gets the shot off.
[00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:10.583]  It seemed like it was that first shot that hit his ear.
[00:24:11.103 --> 00:24:14.886]  It may have been the second, but the timing seemed to me like the first shot hit his ear.
[00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:16.626]  And the others maybe went wide.
[00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:17.507]  That would make sense.
[00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:20.568]  Because the first shot was the one you have infinite amount of time to prepare for.
[00:24:20.728 --> 00:24:20.948]  Yeah.
[00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:21.368]  Right?
[00:24:21.408 --> 00:24:23.729]  All the other shots are a little bit more frantic, your heart rate's up.
[00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:24.649]  Yeah.
[00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:27.090]  The first shot I think would probably be the most accurate most of the time.
[00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:27.610]  Wow.
[00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.831]  Oh, and have you been able to watch, to study this video and does anything jump out to you?
[00:24:32.852 --> 00:24:37.053]  Well, you know, I didn't really sit down to kind of try to measure the ballistics of it.
[00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:39.914]  Obviously there were multiple shots fired.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.622]  Um, my first instinct though upon listening to it was it did sound like a handgun.
[00:24:46.142 --> 00:24:52.025]  You know, I'm not, I'm not acting like I'm a, I'm an expert on firearms here, but I've been to the gun range plenty of times.
[00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:54.286]  I've, I've fired pretty much all types of firearms.
[00:24:55.173 --> 00:24:57.775]  My first response was, that sounds like a handgun.
[00:24:57.815 --> 00:25:06.560]  I don't know if that's true for you guys or not, but then we're told that the guy that was perched on that rooftop was shooting, I guess, some form of a sniper rifle.
[00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:08.302]  I mean, certainly it was a rifle.
[00:25:08.342 --> 00:25:13.405]  I don't know if it was some sort of a long-armed sniper professional rifle, or it was a
[00:25:14.325 --> 00:25:16.585]  A rifle that just had an advanced scope to it?
[00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:23.947]  Again, we're not going to speculate, but there are obviously speculations about multiple shooters, as of course there's going to be.
[00:25:24.567 --> 00:25:28.588]  That just seems to be par for the course with assassination attempts.
[00:25:29.268 --> 00:25:39.490]  But, yeah, my first instincts were, sounds like a handgun, and then, and it was like, okay, one got off, and then like you said, Chase and Harrison, and then it was just like, they just kind of kept firing.
[00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.970]  And maybe by that time,
[00:25:43.004 --> 00:25:49.628]  Again, because now you're asking, okay, well, is it a sniper rifle that has four bullets in a magazine or six or eight?
[00:25:49.768 --> 00:25:52.590]  Is it a handgun that might have ten or sixteen or eight?
[00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.893]  Did he get some shots off and then Secret Service took him out before he could empty his magazine?
[00:25:59.114 --> 00:25:59.594]  I don't know.
[00:25:59.654 --> 00:26:07.499]  I'm not sure if you were able to see it before you came on, Owen, or you may have been setting up with the crew then, but we played an eyewitness video of a guy who saw
[00:26:08.504 --> 00:26:11.126]  The shooter saw him with a rifle on the roof.
[00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:17.950]  He said that multiple people saw him, pointed for two to three minutes, trying to get the attention of the police and the Secret Service guy.
[00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.731]  It looks like we have an overhead map here.
[00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:20.952]  Yeah, there's the video.
[00:26:20.972 --> 00:26:23.494]  So he did confirm it was a gun.
[00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:24.914]  It sounded like a smaller caliber gun.
[00:26:25.235 --> 00:26:27.536]  If we could go to that tweet you guys just had up.
[00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:28.837]  This is a great shot.
[00:26:28.877 --> 00:26:31.138]  That overhead shot is very informative.
[00:26:31.178 --> 00:26:32.019]  We can blow that one up.
[00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.200]  This is from Nick Sartor.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.921]  On X. How was the shooter able to get within 150 yards of President Trump with a rifle?
[00:26:39.322 --> 00:26:43.063]  So it appears to have been within 150 yards.
[00:26:45.163 --> 00:26:45.443]  Wow.
[00:26:45.683 --> 00:26:47.564]  And so yes, this was a fairground.
[00:26:47.604 --> 00:26:48.344]  It was not a stadium.
[00:26:48.384 --> 00:26:51.945]  It was an open space where they have state fairs and things like that.
[00:26:52.985 --> 00:26:55.126]  Again, we're bringing you everything as we get it.
[00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:00.107]  Let's just go to the video again of Trump being shot.
[00:27:00.127 --> 00:27:01.728]  And again, we'll listen to the ballistics.
[00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:23.219]  And guys I'm not sure if we have a version that starts a little bit earlier but the first few seconds in the lead up until the first shot is interesting because you see a lot of it seems to me you see a lot of people look to their right and you see Trump look to his right and it may have been that look that saved his life from the angle and it would be it would be good to know what the angle he was shooting at just to get a comprehensive view of
[00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.420]  Take a look at what happened.
[00:28:01.683 --> 00:28:03.123]  So sort of clusters of shots.
[00:28:04.424 --> 00:28:05.964]  People saying it sounded like fireworks.
[00:28:06.024 --> 00:28:14.187]  It wasn't a big booming sound, which again would make it seem more like a smaller caliber firework.
[00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:19.669]  Yeah, so hearing that now, I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:27.396]  Plus you gotta take into consideration he was 150 yards or so out, so that would make it sound like a smaller caliber.
[00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:28.337]  True.
[00:28:28.357 --> 00:28:34.583]  And there you hear, shooter down, shooter down.
[00:28:38.267 --> 00:28:41.250]  But again, these guys don't know how many shooters there are.
[00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:49.448]  And actually, there was a statement that I will pull in and we can go to in just a little bit made by a senator that was at the rally.
[00:28:49.488 --> 00:28:52.109]  He had just been sort of called up to stage by Trump.
[00:28:52.309 --> 00:28:58.411]  He called into CBS News and reported that he thought he heard shots coming from different directions.
[00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:00.432]  Again, that could be a return fire from Secret Service.
[00:29:01.152 --> 00:29:07.354]  We don't know at this point, and we have not... Well, I think when you hear that, though, I think when you hear that, it's pretty clear.
[00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:09.435]  It sounds like he gets off six shots.
[00:29:10.245 --> 00:29:13.669]  The timing, you could argue, was the first or the second shot, the one that hit him.
[00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:17.753]  But it sounds like he fires three shots, and then fires three more.
[00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:19.775]  Maybe that was the rest that he had.
[00:29:20.295 --> 00:29:25.660]  It probably does sound like a smaller caliber rifle, now that I'm listening to it again.
[00:29:26.081 --> 00:29:29.184]  And then I think that last shot you hear is Secret Service killing him.
[00:29:29.524 --> 00:29:29.704]  Right.
[00:29:29.724 --> 00:29:33.068]  So it sounds like you hear seven shots, you hear six in a row from the shooter.
[00:29:34.132 --> 00:29:39.314]  In spurts of three, and then you hear the last shot, which I'm guessing is Secret Service hitting him.
[00:29:39.374 --> 00:29:47.737]  So I'll let you guys comment further on that, but I think we should talk about that interview and that eyewitness because that's really interesting.
[00:29:48.318 --> 00:29:49.818]  Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:57.021]  And let me just back up a little bit because the first thing you said, Owen, was just such a powerful point about
[00:29:58.917 --> 00:30:05.823]  Just the intersection of fate that we just witnessed, and God's hand in this, and that we were literally an inch away.
[00:30:06.003 --> 00:30:10.087]  We were an inch away from sort of an unimaginable future.
[00:30:10.127 --> 00:30:12.109]  Who knows what would have happened at that point?
[00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.914]  But that was one inch away from absolute catastrophe.
[00:30:19.673 --> 00:30:29.221]  Well, it reminds me of that famous story of George Washington in the French and Indian War in 1755, that battle where his clothes were reportedly riddled with bullet holes, but he was unharmed.
[00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:37.268]  And it's one of those American lore revolutionary stories about the miracles that took place in order for our republic to be established.
[00:30:37.308 --> 00:30:43.373]  Of course, 1755 wasn't the Revolutionary War, but George Washington, of course, was pivotal in our country being started.
[00:30:43.673 --> 00:30:45.275]  And this is a Washington moment, man.
[00:30:45.655 --> 00:30:50.138]  And the story is that, you know, he's out there, he's sitting on his horse just in clear view.
[00:30:50.258 --> 00:30:52.960]  Everybody's firing at him as he's the general and he just doesn't get hit.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.461]  And that's actually a very common thing.
[00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:56.562]  Napoleon had exactly the same experience.
[00:30:56.842 --> 00:30:59.184]  You can go back to Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.
[00:30:59.244 --> 00:31:02.866]  They all seem to have this protection of God over them.
[00:31:03.647 --> 00:31:12.572]  It's something that you see crop up time and time again with great men in history is that they will put themselves out there in the path of danger and yet bullets seem to whiz right by them.
[00:31:12.772 --> 00:31:13.733]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:31:14.818 --> 00:31:22.784]  And of course, it reminds me of the story of Jesus when he says those who live by the sword die by the sword right before he miraculously heals an ear.
[00:31:22.804 --> 00:31:28.268]  This is just a wild day, man.
[00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:31.231]  Yeah, no, just absolutely wild.
[00:31:31.271 --> 00:31:33.132]  Again, we're just we're monitoring things here.
[00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:35.674]  If you're just joining us, this is an emergency broadcast.
[00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:37.716]  We're coming to you live from the InfoWars studio.
[00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:39.617]  It is 8.01 p.m.
[00:31:39.737 --> 00:31:41.378]  Central Time, July 13th.
[00:31:44.036 --> 00:31:47.740]  And we are just receiving word that Alex Jones has a pre-recorded message for us.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.704]  We go now to Alex Jones, who is on location out of state.
[00:31:51.724 --> 00:31:53.786]  But here's Alex Jones on the Trump shooting.
[00:31:55.668 --> 00:31:59.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, I told you that we're not in normal times.
[00:31:59.872 --> 00:32:01.995]  World War III, nuclear war is this close.
[00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:07.049]  They just fired five shots at Trump and hit him in the side of the head.
[00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.211]  And the media's like, oh, big deal.
[00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.612]  He survived an assassination attempt.
[00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:12.654]  This is crazy talent.
[00:32:13.034 --> 00:32:14.296]  Biden is a complete puppet.
[00:32:14.916 --> 00:32:17.078]  The New World Order is melting down everywhere.
[00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:20.921]  And I believe they're getting ready to kill Biden and blame it on a Trump supporter.
[00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:22.663]  I've been saying that for over a year.
[00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:28.959]  So President Trump in Pennsylvania up there gets shot at, gets hit in the side of the head, survives.
[00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:32.660]  That image of him up there with the blood on his face, defiant, is incredible.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:42.083]  And now the deep state that's committed all these crimes and opened the borders and human trafficked and started World War III, they are so desperate, they're going to go for broke.
[00:32:42.763 --> 00:32:46.204]  But I've told Trump, I've told his campaign, you've got to be more careful.
[00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.585]  We've got to pray for President Trump right now.
[00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:50.005]  This is such a dangerous time.
[00:32:50.165 --> 00:32:51.386]  I'm in Northern California.
[00:32:52.423 --> 00:32:55.204]  With what would be a huge story breaking tomorrow, and it's still gonna break.
[00:32:56.944 --> 00:32:58.685]  Massive story we're working on right now, okay?
[00:32:58.885 --> 00:32:59.425]  Secret mission.
[00:33:00.425 --> 00:33:01.325]  And it will still break it.
[00:33:01.765 --> 00:33:06.867]  But ladies and gentlemen, this attempted assassination of Trump means we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:33:07.327 --> 00:33:08.947]  And now they've tried to kill him with a gun.
[00:33:09.827 --> 00:33:11.388]  They're going to try to poison him.
[00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:12.168]  So Trump,
[00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:15.898]  Inside Circle, listen to me.
[00:33:15.938 --> 00:33:16.799]  And I know you've listened before.
[00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:18.020]  You've had the Secret Service call me.
[00:33:18.421 --> 00:33:19.302]  I've briefed them on stuff.
[00:33:19.982 --> 00:33:20.623]  Listen to me.
[00:33:20.683 --> 00:33:22.985]  They're going to try to poison him now.
[00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:24.807]  This blew up in their face.
[00:33:24.887 --> 00:33:25.408]  They failed.
[00:33:25.428 --> 00:33:26.649]  They fired five shots.
[00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.931]  They killed two people.
[00:33:29.994 --> 00:33:30.574]  Maybe three.
[00:33:31.535 --> 00:33:33.996]  Of course they got rid of the shooters so they can't find out who that was.
[00:33:34.536 --> 00:33:38.097]  This means the New World Order is going for broke.
[00:33:38.637 --> 00:33:40.358]  They have nothing to lose now.
[00:33:41.078 --> 00:33:41.839]  Pray for America.
[00:33:41.879 --> 00:33:42.499]  Pray for Trump.
[00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:43.399]  Pray for the free press.
[00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:47.361]  Pray for truth and know with, what is it, 112 days from the election now?
[00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:50.448]  Anything is possible right now.
[00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:56.693]  Deep state, escalation of war with Russia, China, Taiwan, it's all on the table.
[00:33:57.074 --> 00:34:00.596]  False flag terror attacks, blame it on Trump, his supporters, they've been hyping that.
[00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:06.601]  We need to pray right now for mass awakening and mass discernment because America is fighting for its life.
[00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:09.903]  I'm about to do a live show as soon as the crew get into the office.
[00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:11.845]  I just got off an airplane, just got here to where I was staying.
[00:34:13.353 --> 00:34:18.296]  I'm gonna do a live show at Infowars.com forward slash show, banned on video, and real Alex Jones.
[00:34:18.396 --> 00:34:20.298]  I'm collecting all the notes, all the videos.
[00:34:20.998 --> 00:34:28.803]  We'll be live in the next 30 minutes to an hour at Infowars.com forward slash show, banned on video, and real Alex Jones on X. But pray for President Trump.
[00:34:29.204 --> 00:34:31.385]  He needs to get out there and speak immediately about this.
[00:34:31.705 --> 00:34:33.727]  He's gotta be very, very careful, obviously, in the future.
[00:34:34.327 --> 00:34:35.928]  But again, pray for Trump, pray for America.
[00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:37.109]  The deep state has overplayed their hand.
[00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.751]  They're completely screwed, which means they're gonna strike back big time.
[00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:54.890]  Just hours ago, in Pennsylvania, an assassin, who they're now reporting as dead, fired at least five shots at President Trump, hitting him once in the side of the head.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:35:03.173]  And then Trump defiantly stood up and pushed the Secret Service off of him and said, F-U, fight, fight, fight.
[00:35:03.993 --> 00:35:07.634]  This is incredible history happening in front of our face.
[00:35:08.214 --> 00:35:09.435]  This is happening right out in the open.
[00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:17.569]  I told Elon Musk months ago, and he agreed and said he should have a security, and Trump should have a security, that the deep state's not playing games.
[00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:26.313]  They are going for broke, ladies and gentlemen, and the fact that they attempted to kill Trump, and make no mistake, that's who's behind this, means they are going to go all out.
[00:35:26.913 --> 00:35:33.356]  The deep state is now going to try to blow up Trump's airplane, and they're going to try to kill Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson and other leaders.
[00:35:33.996 --> 00:35:44.900]  This is a full coup against any loyal American defending our republic in the process of the populist movement taking our country back.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.660]  So I don't say this as an alarmist.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.821]  I was on the show just days ago.
[00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:51.382]  We'll post it to X. The crew's coming in right now on Saturday night.
[00:35:51.602 --> 00:35:52.222]  They're going to pull it up.
[00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:54.843]  Saying they're going to try to kill Trump imminently.
[00:35:55.063 --> 00:35:56.744]  They're going to try to kill Elon Musk imminently.
[00:35:57.424 --> 00:35:59.625]  I don't say stuff just to say it.
[00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:03.246]  I say it when I see all the evidence and I know it.
[00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:07.578]  And notice how the media is pointing out, oh, he survived the assassination, no big deal.
[00:36:07.838 --> 00:36:08.899]  They're blocking the news.
[00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:11.840]  The incredible footage of him shot in the side of the head, the blood.
[00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.982]  Him saying, fight, fight, fight.
[00:36:14.782 --> 00:36:15.543]  This is insane.
[00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:20.846]  But thank God Elon has said, officially now, he fully endorses and supports President Trump.
[00:36:21.226 --> 00:36:22.587]  We need unity right now.
[00:36:23.287 --> 00:36:24.608]  And I'm not a drama queen, folks.
[00:36:25.677 --> 00:36:27.458]  This is a real fight against the globalists.
[00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:28.820]  They want to kill Elon Musk.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.980]  They want to kill Donald Trump.
[00:36:30.281 --> 00:36:31.582]  They want to kill Tucker Carlson.
[00:36:31.922 --> 00:36:34.444]  They might even kill Joe Rogan because Joe is fully awake now.
[00:36:34.824 --> 00:36:39.148]  They can't have these incredibly popular, populist voices out telling the truth.
[00:36:39.188 --> 00:36:42.831]  And I'm in danger too, but I'm down the list a long way.
[00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:46.233]  So America is in maximum danger right now.
[00:36:46.274 --> 00:36:51.037]  We do not need anybody to go out and be violent to respond to this.
[00:36:51.638 --> 00:36:53.760]  And I know you're smart, you wouldn't do that, but the globalists,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.661]  So now we're in maximum danger.
[00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.003]  I'm in Northern California working on a huge story that breaks tomorrow.
[00:36:58.023 --> 00:36:58.763]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:28.352]  But I'll be doing a live show tonight at fullwords.com forward slash show and band dot video.
[00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:29.754]  We'll be breaking it all down.
[00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:34.978]  Follow me at RealAlexJones here on X. But this is a serious time for America and the world.
[00:37:35.258 --> 00:37:36.539]  The deep state is in trouble.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.021]  They're losing, so they're gonna go for broke.
[00:37:39.662 --> 00:37:40.703]  Just like they killed Kennedy in 63.
[00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:43.545]  But this time, America and the world's awake.
[00:37:43.945 --> 00:37:44.986]  Pray for President Trump.
[00:37:45.607 --> 00:37:46.407]  Pray for justice.
[00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:47.408]  Pray for a great awakening.
[00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:48.309]  And pray for peace.
[00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:50.391]  We'll be breaking it all down at RealAlexJones right here on X.
[00:37:54.102 --> 00:37:56.683]  Listen to me very carefully.
[00:37:57.664 --> 00:38:00.125]  I have told you for months on air they're going to try to kill Trump.
[00:38:00.746 --> 00:38:04.648]  And when they try to kill Trump, they're going to go after everybody else that is his top supporters.
[00:38:04.988 --> 00:38:08.350]  And they also will try to kill Biden and blame it on a Trump supporter.
[00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:09.991]  That's coming next.
[00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:15.934]  Make no mistake, the same deep state that's behind Biden, that's trying to make him step down, was behind this today.
[00:38:15.954 --> 00:38:18.716]  They're now reporting it was an Antifa shooter who's now been killed.
[00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:22.258]  How convenient is that, that the supposed shooter has been killed?
[00:38:23.086 --> 00:38:28.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Republic is in maximum danger right now.
[00:38:29.111 --> 00:38:35.397]  I'm about to go live at InfoWars.com, Fort Slush Show, Vandaught Video, and right here on X. There has been an attempted assassination.
[00:38:36.158 --> 00:38:40.882]  The real President of the United States has been shot and by God's good graces has survived.
[00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:43.124]  The bullet only grazed him over the ear and the side of his head.
[00:38:44.705 --> 00:38:45.426]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:47.990]  The deep state is desperate.
[00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.710]  They are in trouble.
[00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.191]  They're going to try to expand wars.
[00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.572]  They can do power outages.
[00:38:51.592 --> 00:38:52.653]  They can do cyber attacks.
[00:38:53.073 --> 00:38:54.914]  We are in such a dangerous position.
[00:38:55.294 --> 00:38:59.116]  And I've noticed with all the viral videos out there, it's like, oh, he took a bullet for America.
[00:38:59.577 --> 00:39:01.038]  He's going to get reelected now.
[00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Deep State did this.
[00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:06.571]  Make no mistake.
[00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:09.372]  And that lets you know they're going for broke.
[00:39:09.412 --> 00:39:13.133]  Do you fucking understand what I'm telling you?
[00:39:13.673 --> 00:39:16.013]  Take this deadly serious.
[00:39:16.514 --> 00:39:17.574]  Just like war with Russia.
[00:39:18.614 --> 00:39:20.835]  They are going to try to kill Trump again.
[00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:24.095]  Now that they didn't kill him once, they are completely desperate.
[00:39:25.036 --> 00:39:25.876]  And I'm going to tell you again.
[00:39:26.892 --> 00:39:27.872]  Biden won't step down.
[00:39:27.912 --> 00:39:32.734]  The deep state will probably kill him or try to kill him in the next few days and blame it on a Trump supporter.
[00:39:33.054 --> 00:39:36.695]  And we may see massive terror attacks in America that are blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:37.875]  They've been pre-programming it.
[00:39:38.135 --> 00:39:38.916]  They've been preparing.
[00:39:39.016 --> 00:39:44.637]  I've been telling you, imminent assassination attempt on Trump every damn day.
[00:39:45.338 --> 00:39:49.959]  Because that's what a dying, corrupt establishment does when their back is against the wall.
[00:39:51.544 --> 00:39:53.586]  We're living in a historical moment right now.
[00:39:54.346 --> 00:39:59.170]  We need Americans, people around the world, to pray for President Trump and pray for America, but also politically.
[00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:14.581]  Get out there on X and everywhere else that has some free speech and get the point out that this attempted assassination that actually wounded the President, took a bullet for America, lies at the feet of the deep state and the corporate media that said, kill him.
[00:40:15.482 --> 00:40:16.263]  Destroy him.
[00:40:16.663 --> 00:40:17.685]  He deserves to die.
[00:40:17.725 --> 00:40:18.445]  He's a fascist.
[00:40:18.465 --> 00:40:19.186]  He's a Nazi.
[00:40:19.466 --> 00:40:21.629]  It lays at their feet.
[00:40:22.089 --> 00:40:25.113]  Instead, I see conservatives celebrating, hey, he'll win for sure now.
[00:40:27.635 --> 00:40:30.378]  It means the globalists are going to go for a broke.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.361]  It means they know their time is up.
[00:40:35.003 --> 00:40:37.045]  So I'm glad Trump survived.
[00:40:37.165 --> 00:40:38.606]  I am so happy.
[00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:39.486]  Thank God.
[00:40:39.546 --> 00:40:40.227]  Thank you, Jesus.
[00:40:40.247 --> 00:40:44.170]  But ladies and gentlemen, do you think this happened by accident?
[00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.790]  No.
[00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:47.733]  And do you think the system is going to back down now?
[00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:48.293]  No.
[00:40:49.354 --> 00:40:53.437]  Power outages, cyber attacks, expanded war, China invading Taiwan.
[00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:57.595]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to The Info War.
[00:41:17.816 --> 00:41:23.939]  That was Alex Jones in a pre-recorded statement posted to X. He will be calling in to this broadcast.
[00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:27.160]  We are coming to you live from the InfoWars studio for this emergency broadcast.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:27.920]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.421]  Joining me in studio is Chase Geiser.
[00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:34.103]  Owen Schroyer, on a remote location, joins us as well.
[00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:35.559]  Well,
[00:42:05.328 --> 00:42:09.992]  This interview, this eyewitness account begs a lot of questions.
[00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:16.637]  It begs a lot of questions about the security failures and the Secret Service failures that led to this.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:32.983]  I think I kind of want to pitch to my final analysis here before Alex joins you, too, with a video from myself on the InfoWars War Room last year because, folks, there's a reason why they call InfoWars next year's news today.
[00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:35.843]  You just heard Alex talking about his coverage of this.
[00:42:35.863 --> 00:42:39.284]  There's a clip going viral of him and Tucker Carlson warning about this.
[00:42:39.984 --> 00:42:44.265]  This was me on the InfoWars War Room just last year.
[00:42:46.457 --> 00:42:48.418]  These are dangerous people.
[00:42:48.878 --> 00:43:00.083]  They are two cultural, political steps away from dragging you out of your home and shooting you in the head in the middle of your street for all your neighbors to see.
[00:43:01.423 --> 00:43:02.383]  You think that's a joke?
[00:43:03.904 --> 00:43:08.306]  I hope I don't have to sit here a year from now saying, hate to say I told you so.
[00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.007]  But, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:10.227 --> 00:43:15.969]  Understand, historically speaking, the American left are basically two political, two cultural moves away
[00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:21.369]  From hauling their opposition out into the streets and just shooting them in the head.
[00:43:23.612 --> 00:43:29.959]  So here I am a year ago, or a year from then, and I'm hating to say, I told you so.
[00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:34.691]  But this has kind of been the story of InfoWars, warning of everything coming and now we're here.
[00:43:34.711 --> 00:43:44.724]  And that's why I hope that this is the shot heard around the world that really wakens America up to how serious the situation that we're in is, how dire the situation that we're in is.
[00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:47.047]  Now, getting back to the security issues.
[00:43:48.513 --> 00:44:00.329]  This is going to lead us down a lot of different roads, because I agree with Alex that I think the next big thing we need to be on the lookout for is an attempt on Biden's life from some guy in a MAGA hat.
[00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.434]  But let's try to look at all the angles here, okay?
[00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.036]  Let's look at today's event first.
[00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:28.399]  Could this have been a lone shooter, just a radical leftist who fell for the MKUltra mind control that Trump is a Nazi and Trump is Hitler, this left-wing propaganda mind control that they've been initiating against the American left, the liberal, the progressive, the Democrat voter to finally go out and do this?
[00:44:28.439 --> 00:44:32.002]  They already had it at the Republican baseball practice with James Hodgkinson.
[00:44:32.913 --> 00:44:35.714]  And now they have the attempt on Donald Trump's life.
[00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:41.635]  This is why they show you the image of Kathy Griffin holding a decapitated bloody Trump head.
[00:44:41.935 --> 00:44:45.956]  This is why they show you the music video of Snoop Dogg putting a gun to Trump's head and pulling the trigger.
[00:44:46.296 --> 00:44:51.557]  This is why they had the New York Street Theater depicting an assassination of Donald Trump and on and on and on.
[00:44:51.837 --> 00:44:59.699]  This was all MKUltra mind control to finally get a radical leftist to go out there and actually pull the trigger.
[00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:04.675]  Let's say this is just a lone guy who decided to do this on his own.
[00:45:05.413 --> 00:45:17.143]  There's also the potential that you could have the CIA or somebody, the NSA, who already knew this was going to happen, so they maybe went out there to try to assure that Trump did go down.
[00:45:17.203 --> 00:45:31.094]  And so if it does end up being a two-shooter situation, I think that that then becomes the story that we look into, was that, yeah, of course the intelligence agencies could have found out that this guy was going to go do it, and if they let him do it but then have their own guy there to make sure that the job gets done,
[00:45:32.054 --> 00:45:34.115]  You know, that's what people think happened to JFK.
[00:45:34.375 --> 00:45:35.676]  So then there's that potential.
[00:45:37.097 --> 00:45:39.318]  Or there's the potential that this guy was set up altogether.
[00:45:39.378 --> 00:45:41.518]  But dead men tell no tales, right?
[00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:44.760]  So who knows what we'll end up finding out about this.
[00:45:45.424 --> 00:45:49.426]  But I think that that's kind of where we're at as far as the shooter today is concerned.
[00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:51.106]  But I do agree with Alex.
[00:45:51.186 --> 00:45:54.988]  I think that the next big move is an attempt on Biden's life.
[00:45:55.588 --> 00:45:58.749]  And the guy that does it is wearing a MAGA hat.
[00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.050]  Now, this could all be a setup.
[00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:01.891]  It could just be a total setup.
[00:46:01.991 --> 00:46:03.391]  They could have a PSYOP running.
[00:46:03.411 --> 00:46:06.252]  They could have some stooge that they go out and drug up and do it.
[00:46:08.073 --> 00:46:10.154]  You know, kind of like in the Zoolander movie.
[00:46:10.174 --> 00:46:12.675]  I mean, it's a comedy movie, but literally that's what they do.
[00:46:12.715 --> 00:46:15.216]  They PSYOP these people into becoming assassins.
[00:46:15.959 --> 00:46:18.783]  And then they put the political propaganda in them.
[00:46:18.823 --> 00:46:20.585]  I mean, look how they covered up the Vegas shooting.
[00:46:20.645 --> 00:46:26.853]  So I do fear that that is the next shoe to drop given the political climate that we're in.
[00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:31.352]  And it kills two birds with one stone for the Democrats in the deep state.
[00:46:31.412 --> 00:46:35.533]  They get rid of Joe Biden and now they have their narrative about Trump supporters.
[00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:37.414]  This is all really bad talk.
[00:46:37.674 --> 00:46:38.274]  Let's be clear.
[00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:42.736]  This is like telling your loved one, your dad, your mom, whatever, that they have cancer and they're dying.
[00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:43.376]  It's sick.
[00:46:43.516 --> 00:46:44.276]  It's disgusting.
[00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:44.896]  I hate this.
[00:46:44.996 --> 00:46:45.897]  It makes me feel sick.
[00:46:45.937 --> 00:46:48.677]  But unfortunately, this is the climate we're in.
[00:46:48.718 --> 00:46:50.078]  Yeah, there's a tornado.
[00:46:50.398 --> 00:46:51.358]  It's a mile away.
[00:46:51.878 --> 00:46:53.199]  It's an F5.
[00:46:53.499 --> 00:46:54.799]  It's heading right towards our house.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.580]  We got to bunker down.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.662]  So this is not fun talk.
[00:46:58.702 --> 00:46:59.624]  This is scary talk.
[00:46:59.684 --> 00:47:00.625]  I don't really enjoy it.
[00:47:00.665 --> 00:47:04.570]  But this is the reality of the situation that we are in, unfortunately.
[00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.612]  So what does Trump do?
[00:47:05.652 --> 00:47:06.032]  What do we do?
[00:47:12.238 --> 00:47:21.029]  It's up to the American people to wake up to what happened today with Donald Trump.
[00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:28.679]  It's up to the American people to understand that this is one of two things, or both, that this is the radical left attempting to kill Donald Trump.
[00:47:29.199 --> 00:47:33.961]  Or this is the deep state trying to assassinate Donald Trump or some combination of the two.
[00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:40.503]  That's the reality that we have to hope the American people wake up to today after this assassination attempt on Trump.
[00:47:41.003 --> 00:47:42.703]  But then what about the other side?
[00:47:42.743 --> 00:47:47.145]  What about they try to false flag their own event or try to false flag Joe Biden?
[00:47:47.545 --> 00:47:49.766]  You know, what do we do to stop that?
[00:47:49.886 --> 00:47:51.046]  What do we do to avoid that?
[00:47:51.126 --> 00:47:53.247]  What do we do to get out ahead of that narrative?
[00:47:53.567 --> 00:47:54.707]  Because I agree with Alex.
[00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:56.828]  I think that that's definitely in the cards.
[00:47:57.929 --> 00:47:59.151]  I don't know the answer to that.
[00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:00.794]  I mean, we've never called for violence.
[00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.437]  We always advocate for peace.
[00:48:02.497 --> 00:48:03.659]  We always say, don't do that.
[00:48:03.699 --> 00:48:06.744]  It would be bad for us, just like Alex was doing on January 6th.
[00:48:08.837 --> 00:48:13.740]  I don't know the perfect answer to that, but there's no doubt this is what needs to be considered.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.782]  So I think that that's kind of where we stand right now.
[00:48:18.123 --> 00:48:21.886]  It's unfortunate that InfoWars has proven right yet again on this issue.
[00:48:21.926 --> 00:48:23.227]  It's actually quite heartbreaking.
[00:48:23.307 --> 00:48:27.850]  But at the same time, like I said in my opening statement tonight,
[00:48:28.852 --> 00:48:39.418]  Seeing Trump stand up there defiantly and raising his fist in the air triumphantly, saying fight, it's one of the most inspiring things that I've ever seen in my life.
[00:48:40.138 --> 00:48:44.521]  It's going to go down as one of the most inspiring things that's happened in American history.
[00:48:45.214 --> 00:48:49.999]  I hope that this is all part of God's plan to save our country.
[00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:51.600]  I hope that we deserve that mercy.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.102]  I hope that we deserve that grace.
[00:48:53.582 --> 00:48:57.526]  I hope that we can pray to God to find our role in that.
[00:48:58.327 --> 00:49:03.051]  And I hope that that's a sign of things to come, but we're not out of the woods.
[00:49:03.092 --> 00:49:04.453]  There's plenty to feel good about.
[00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:27.920]  With the future of America, and I do believe in America, and I do wake up every day and believe it's worth fighting for, but there's also the realization that, yeah, there is an enemy within, there is an enemy present, and they do want us dead, they do want us destroyed, they hate us, and today, unfortunately, is evidence of both of these phenomenons taking place at the same time.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.702]  That's why it's one of the greatest lines ever penned in a book.
[00:49:32.322 --> 00:49:33.463]  It was the best of times,
[00:49:33.942 --> 00:49:37.965]  It was the worst of times, and that seems to be where we are today, gentlemen.
[00:49:38.465 --> 00:50:02.580]  Let me ask you, I know you have to go, Owen, I don't want to keep you too long, but just as you're talking there, and we have a lot of clips to go to, and we can go to a lot of them, but what do you think, and this is pure speculation, but just thinking about the timeline here, and the fact that Joe Biden has, for the last two weeks, totally failed to make up for his debate performance, and you have Democrats in general, and leftists, you know,
[00:50:03.573 --> 00:50:07.294]  In total, feeling like Trump is inevitable at this point.
[00:50:07.475 --> 00:50:14.657]  I mean, what are the odds that you've got a leftist who, you know, hates Donald Trump, but still thinks there's a chance that, you know, Biden will win.
[00:50:14.817 --> 00:50:19.799]  And then over the last two weeks, it's proven to him that there's no way and there's nobody to replace him.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.981]  And maybe at that point, he decides, hey, you know,
[00:50:24.753 --> 00:50:26.214]  We got to get this done one way or another.
[00:50:26.274 --> 00:50:39.321]  After all, Trump is Hitler, and you know, as you talked about, just all of the, as they would say, staccatic terrorism that the left has engaged in with Donald Trump, including Joe Biden, who on July 8th said we need to put Donald Trump in the bullseye.
[00:50:40.422 --> 00:50:46.845]  And I don't think, I don't think that was a slip of the tongue, personally, and we know how the leftists talk about this.
[00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:48.326]  This is war, and it feels different.
[00:50:49.227 --> 00:50:51.688]  It feels like things have changed, and I'm not sure how.
[00:50:51.728 --> 00:50:53.549]  I think that's what you're sort of getting at, Owen, but
[00:50:54.122 --> 00:50:59.724]  What do you think about that, the timing of this, when you consider what's been going on with Biden over the last two weeks?
[00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:03.445]  Well, I'm glad you bring that stochastic terror term up.
[00:51:03.465 --> 00:51:10.107]  That was something that the left tried to push, another pure projection from the American left.
[00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:12.527]  It was AOC, one of the ones pushing that.
[00:51:12.587 --> 00:51:14.348]  And of course, it's what they're guilty of.
[00:51:15.248 --> 00:51:21.290]  You know, I think when we know more about the shooter, it'll probably be easier to answer that question.
[00:51:22.222 --> 00:51:34.046]  So the more we find out about when he decided to do this, or how long he's been planning to do this, or did he travel to do this, I think that we'll probably have a better idea.
[00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:41.429]  It's hard to think that the two things are not connected, but we may find out that he's been planning this thing for a long time.
[00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:42.209]  I don't know when
[00:51:42.952 --> 00:51:44.554]  Trump announced this rally.
[00:51:44.714 --> 00:51:49.198]  I suppose that would be the earliest this guy could have possibly been planning this thing.
[00:51:49.638 --> 00:51:55.103]  So I mean, that might be your first clue as far as, you know, how much planning was put into this.
[00:51:55.163 --> 00:51:59.447]  But again, there's going to be there's going to have to be a lot of things answered, I think, before we can get into that.
[00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:04.532]  I think the question, though, I think the question that's ahead of us to be answered now is,
[00:52:05.112 --> 00:52:07.634]  How was there such a massive security failure?
[00:52:08.034 --> 00:52:12.718]  How is it that this guy's able to climb onto the roof with a gun?
[00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:13.778]  A white roof, too.
[00:52:13.858 --> 00:52:14.879]  I mean, the contrast.
[00:52:14.919 --> 00:52:15.239]  Yeah.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.781]  It's so easy to see.
[00:52:17.821 --> 00:52:18.402]  But think about it.
[00:52:18.422 --> 00:52:20.903]  I've been to a lot of Trump rallies.
[00:52:21.124 --> 00:52:21.884]  So have you guys.
[00:52:22.705 --> 00:52:24.286]  Whether it's a rally or not, it could be any event.
[00:52:25.226 --> 00:52:26.347]  And it was during the day.
[00:52:26.407 --> 00:52:27.108]  The sun was out.
[00:52:27.168 --> 00:52:28.329]  This wasn't a dark thing.
[00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:29.510]  This wasn't a dark theater.
[00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.672]  This was an open, sunny day.
[00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:40.479]  And this guy's able to scale a wall with a gun and then get himself positioned on the roof.
[00:52:41.059 --> 00:52:47.386]  I mean, I'm sure that that entire series of events probably took at least a couple minutes.
[00:52:47.786 --> 00:52:48.327]  I'm guessing.
[00:52:48.387 --> 00:52:52.932]  I'm guessing from the time he started scaling the wall to the time he fired the first shot.
[00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:53.833]  I mean,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.642]  What do you think, about five minutes, I'm guessing?
[00:52:56.702 --> 00:53:06.512]  So how does this happen when there's some guy standing up there screaming, pointing it out, and nobody does anything about it, or nobody says, hey, get Trump off the stage?
[00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:09.856]  I mean, he could have been rushed off the stage as soon as they found that guy.
[00:53:09.876 --> 00:53:11.798]  So, I mean, this is really where the questions are.
[00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:19.686]  You know, Secret Service probably has the most trusted reputation when it comes to security.
[00:53:19.726 --> 00:53:31.399]  Certainly more than the FBI or the CIA or the DHS or the, you know, I mean... When they do like a drive-thru of a city, they have every building and every window overlooking the place cleared out.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.140]  It seems...
[00:53:33.266 --> 00:53:41.875]  It seems very, I don't want to say suspicious, but very out of the ordinary that on a farm with only a few buildings that those wouldn't be secured and checked.
[00:53:41.915 --> 00:53:43.476]  They go so overboard.
[00:53:43.836 --> 00:53:51.404]  For even brief appearances from the Vice President, I mean, they will clear an entire building, you know, go through with drug or bomb sniffing dogs.
[00:53:51.444 --> 00:53:51.644]  I mean,
[00:53:53.026 --> 00:54:04.522]  I also don't understand how this got past Secret Service, which is, you know, we can talk a lot of crap about the government, but they take protecting themselves very seriously, and they're usually really on top of things.
[00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:08.167]  We actually have a statement from the Secret Service that was released just minutes ago.
[00:54:09.108 --> 00:54:11.630]  Let me read this and get your response, Owen.
[00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:23.079]  During former President Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on the evening of July 13th at approximately 6.15 p.m., a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:23.720]  U.S.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.422]  Secret Service personnel neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased.
[00:54:26.903 --> 00:54:27.083]  U.S.
[00:54:27.103 --> 00:54:31.426]  Secret Service quickly responded with protective measures, and the former president is safe and being evaluated.
[00:54:31.847 --> 00:54:32.907]  One spectator was killed.
[00:54:33.027 --> 00:54:34.669]  Two spectators were critically injured.
[00:54:35.049 --> 00:54:39.510]  The incident is currently under investigation and the Secret Service has formally notified the FBI.
[00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:44.792]  That's from Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Communications at the Secret Service.
[00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:47.832]  So that's their very boilerplate response.
[00:54:47.872 --> 00:54:53.214]  But now we know one spectator killed, two injured critically, and the shooter himself
[00:54:53.934 --> 00:54:54.875]  Dispatched by U.S.
[00:54:55.215 --> 00:54:57.176]  Secret Service moments after the shots were fired.
[00:54:57.777 --> 00:55:01.619]  Again, if you are just joining us, this is an emergency broadcast, InfoWars.com.
[00:55:02.219 --> 00:55:06.042]  And thank God that we're not sitting here talking about an assassination right now.
[00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:11.285]  Thank God that Donald Trump survived this by less than an inch, by mere millimeters.
[00:55:12.426 --> 00:55:17.529]  Just thank God that things aren't worse than they are, but recognize how bad they are.
[00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.931]  And thank God InfoWars is here to cover it.
[00:55:20.151 --> 00:55:22.632]  They want us off the air for a reason, and it's because as things
[00:55:23.693 --> 00:55:29.806]  As the Deep State gets increasingly desperate, things are gonna get increasingly crazy, and the need for...
[00:55:31.089 --> 00:55:34.490]  People actually trying to tell the truth is going to be increasing as well.
[00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:40.012]  So I'm glad that we're here and I'm glad that you've gone to InfoWarsStore.com to keep us here.
[00:55:40.152 --> 00:55:42.213]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones shortly.
[00:55:42.613 --> 00:55:51.617]  Mike Adams, Health Ranger, is actually doing an audio breakdown of the shots from the video to try to determine a little bit more information.
[00:55:51.657 --> 00:55:53.777]  He'll be joining us shortly as well.
[00:55:54.157 --> 00:55:58.199]  I'm Harrison Smith here with Chase Geiser in studio and Owen Schroer joining us remotely.
[00:55:58.839 --> 00:56:02.161]  As we bring you the latest about this assassination.
[00:56:02.182 --> 00:56:05.344]  And I don't know, do we want to open up the phone lines and get calls?
[00:56:05.364 --> 00:56:06.685]  Do we want to do Twitter spaces?
[00:56:06.705 --> 00:56:08.146]  Let's do the phone lines.
[00:56:08.166 --> 00:56:13.609]  Okay, Alex is going to be on momentarily and then we'll figure out what to do next after.
[00:56:13.649 --> 00:56:15.691]  Yeah, let me clear the way for Alex then here guys.
[00:56:15.891 --> 00:56:18.813]  I'll get out of the way for Alex and the callers and all the great guests and clips.
[00:56:19.313 --> 00:56:21.955]  I just want to respond to something you pointed out Harrison, which is so key.
[00:56:22.674 --> 00:56:25.841]  I've been to many events where the president is present.
[00:56:26.001 --> 00:56:32.795]  I've been to baseball games, I've been to rallies, I've been to hockey games where the president is there and every single time they have
[00:56:33.391 --> 00:56:35.772]  Snipers at the highest vantage point.
[00:56:35.993 --> 00:56:44.197]  I've never seen an event where the president is present and they don't have snipers at the highest vantage point so that they can avoid something like this happening.
[00:56:44.237 --> 00:56:46.438]  So I don't think it's a stretch at all to say it's suspicious.
[00:56:46.758 --> 00:56:52.582]  Hey, look, sometimes things are suspicious and there's nothing to it, but I don't think it's far-fetched at all to say this is suspicious.
[00:56:53.082 --> 00:56:56.564]  Anthony Mayorkas, the head of DHS, needs to be asked about this.
[00:56:56.944 --> 00:57:00.146]  Kim Cheadle, the head of Secret Service, needs to be asked about this.
[00:57:00.466 --> 00:57:01.787]  The people that were on the scene
[00:57:02.527 --> 00:57:04.469]  Thanks to God, and I do believe this was an act of God.
[00:57:18.863 --> 00:57:18.983]  Wow.
[00:57:38.243 --> 00:57:41.965]  It's absolutely incredible and more information, more video coming out.
[00:57:42.485 --> 00:57:43.606]  We actually have video now.
[00:57:43.666 --> 00:57:46.827]  I just reposted it, guys, on my Twitter from Clown World.
[00:57:46.867 --> 00:57:50.609]  Footage of the sniper taking shots at the shooter who shot Donald Trump.
[00:57:50.629 --> 00:57:52.930]  So he dispatched him immediately.
[00:57:54.411 --> 00:58:03.375]  Again, they said shooter down just mere seconds after Trump was sort of tackled by the Secret Service, but still you have to, you have to
[00:58:05.202 --> 00:58:05.902]  I'll just say, God bless
[00:58:29.264 --> 00:58:35.253]  God bless America, God bless Donald Trump, God bless InfoWars, and we will be seeing you guys soon.
[00:58:35.273 --> 00:58:36.054]  Amen.
[00:58:36.074 --> 00:58:36.595]  Thank you, Don.
[00:58:36.615 --> 00:58:37.516]  Pleasure to be with you.
[00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:39.139]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:58:40.741 --> 00:58:41.302]  Just incredible.
[00:58:42.108 --> 00:58:55.500]  Now, what's going to be very interesting to see, in my opinion, and I know we want to avoid speculation, even though speculation is the root of prophecy, is how is the media going to cover this next?
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.803]  Because whatever the characterization or demographic or details are of this shooter,
[00:59:00.484 --> 00:59:06.008]  We know that the mainstream media is going to weaponize that to try to neutralize how this could benefit the Trump campaign, right?
[00:59:06.068 --> 00:59:07.549]  Obviously, it's a tragedy that it happened.
[00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:13.894]  I wish that it hadn't happened, but the fact of the matter is this is only good for Trump in terms of his candidacy, right?
[00:59:14.194 --> 00:59:19.158]  It's unfortunate that this type of thing has to happen for it to be beneficial, and it should never have gotten to this point.
[00:59:19.978 --> 00:59:23.042]  And so I'm very interested to see how this plays out.
[00:59:23.242 --> 00:59:39.222]  And I know that there's been discussion over the course of the last 30 minutes, you know, as we hear more or learn more about the shooter, I am very reluctant to even accept the notion that we're ever going to really learn more or understand more about this shooter
[00:59:39.602 --> 00:59:40.262]  Thanks for watching!
[01:00:00.854 --> 01:00:03.176]  Yeah, what we have now is very little.
[01:00:03.216 --> 01:00:11.484]  We have a very sort of grainy image of the shooter after he was dispatched, after he was shot by Secret Service.
[01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:14.050]  Not much to say about that.
[01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.651]  It's been reported he is a white male.
[01:00:18.011 --> 01:00:21.692]  He looked, from my observation, to be somewhere between 20 and 30.
[01:00:22.892 --> 01:00:23.492]  We're not sure.
[01:00:23.612 --> 01:00:29.353]  Approximately, is that 400 feet, it says, from the shooter's location to the Trump stage?
[01:00:29.413 --> 01:00:36.154]  That's a hard, that's a hard... That's a very long... Well, I've seen other reports from Nick Sordo that it was 150, though.
[01:00:36.314 --> 01:00:38.014]  That'd be probably maybe 150 yards.
[01:00:38.054 --> 01:00:38.415]  Is that 400 feet?
[01:00:38.455 --> 01:00:39.335]  Something like that.
[01:00:39.655 --> 01:00:39.795]  Yeah.
[01:00:41.727 --> 01:00:48.009]  Yeah, a lot of this is still inexact, but there's the shot of the shooter himself.
[01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:52.411]  He appears to be wearing, I don't know if it's fatigues or some sort of camouflage.
[01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:58.133]  I know that the right sleeve of his shirt had an active duty orientation flag on it.
[01:00:58.173 --> 01:00:59.373]  He could be former military.
[01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:03.755]  I mean, hitting somebody in the ear from 400 feet is not easy.
[01:01:05.575 --> 01:01:06.275]  Absolutely insane.
[01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:06.916]  And by the way,
[01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:13.672]  On April 20th of this year, Democrats look to strip Secret Service protection from Trump if he's convicted.
[01:01:15.552 --> 01:01:16.573]  And that's on Fox News.
[01:01:16.753 --> 01:01:21.814]  So remember, I mean, it was earlier this year they were actively trying to strip Donald Trump of his Secret Service protection.
[01:01:22.715 --> 01:01:23.275]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.012]  And that's the thing.
[01:01:25.032 --> 01:01:30.835]  I mean, and that's what Alex was saying in his videos that, you know, a big response these days as well.
[01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:32.356]  Now Trump's definitely going to win.
[01:01:32.516 --> 01:01:38.259]  And like Owen was saying, it's up to the American people if they can see for themselves what's actually going on.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.042]  But, you know, I've talked to very normal, seemingly reasonable people.
[01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:46.120]  That it basically said, hey, you know what?
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.482]  Whatever Trump gets arrested for, I don't really care.
[01:01:48.502 --> 01:01:49.362]  I just want him arrested.
[01:01:49.402 --> 01:01:54.386]  You know, there's almost this sense of just like, just get rid of this guy.
[01:01:54.686 --> 01:01:56.187]  Just, you know, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:56.207 --> 01:01:57.648]  I hate to say that.
[01:01:57.668 --> 01:02:03.272]  Oh, you know there are so many Democrats in their private group chats right now saying, oh, it's too bad he missed, too bad he missed.
[01:02:03.513 --> 01:02:05.074]  You know, there's so many assholes like that.
[01:02:05.174 --> 01:02:06.194]  They're saying it in public too.
[01:02:06.294 --> 01:02:10.357]  I mean, I don't even want to go into it, but it's just exactly what you expect.
[01:02:10.377 --> 01:02:11.598]  Yeah, leftists are celebrating this.
[01:02:11.638 --> 01:02:12.399]  And this is what
[01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:23.084]  What America has been primed to not just expect, but desire with the just endless propaganda of Trump's bloody head being held up by Kathy Griffin.
[01:02:23.104 --> 01:02:31.627]  I mean, that was just... And you have to keep in mind, if this had happened to Joe Biden, we would be at this desk and we would be saying, this is terrible that this happened.
[01:02:31.687 --> 01:02:33.407]  This is only good for the Democrats.
[01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.548]  We're good to go.
[01:02:56.724 --> 01:03:00.427]  Who's been faced with assassination is alarming.
[01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:04.551]  I will say, though, that the Krasensteins, of all people, have been pretty classy.
[01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:05.071]  Yeah.
[01:03:05.512 --> 01:03:05.732]  Yes.
[01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:06.292]  Yeah.
[01:03:06.332 --> 01:03:14.119]  See, I tuned into a space with one of them on it and, you know, somebody said, look, this is the leftist staccatic terror.
[01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:16.922]  And they were trying to, you know, distract from that.
[01:03:17.482 --> 01:03:20.185]  Alex Jones joins us live from California.
[01:03:20.205 --> 01:03:21.666]  Thanks for calling in, Alex.
[01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:24.248]  All right.
[01:03:24.408 --> 01:03:29.590]  I came out here for a really big story that we're still going to break, but this is the biggest story of our lifetime.
[01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:32.210]  So I want to be very clear with all viewers and listeners right now.
[01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:40.653]  I want to take this clip out as soon as I'm not on air and I want to post it on X and I want you guys to stay up there throughout the night.
[01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:44.574]  I'm going to be here with you all night because let me explain something very slowly and very clearly.
[01:03:45.774 --> 01:03:49.595]  I've told everybody probably 500 times last six months, at least.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.023]  That the deep state is going to kill Trump or try to kill Trump.
[01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:59.246]  And when they kill Trump, they're going to go after Musk, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan.
[01:03:59.747 --> 01:04:03.289]  I don't say these things because I'm just making this stuff up.
[01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:04.290]  Close that door for me, Rob.
[01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.133]  I'm not saying these things because I just made it up my head.
[01:04:08.613 --> 01:04:10.374]  I've studied clandestine operations.
[01:04:10.474 --> 01:04:11.275]  I've studied coups.
[01:04:11.755 --> 01:04:12.816]  I've studied the CIA.
[01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.438]  But before we go any further,
[01:04:17.162 --> 01:04:21.526]  I want to just say thank you, God, for protecting President Donald John Trump.
[01:04:22.587 --> 01:04:28.191]  Thank you that when those five bullets got shot at him, that only one grazed him and two inches over would have killed him.
[01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:34.397]  And thank you, God, the providence you've given our nation as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:40.422]  And we pray, all of us pray, for a hedge of protection to be put up by your angels
[01:04:41.104 --> 01:05:02.454]  Around Donald John Trump right now in the name of Jesus because this is a satanic war and we know that and we recognize that we cannot overcome these princes and principalities of the air without your divine intervention and we call on the God of the universe through his son and his intercessor Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:12.837]  To put up a hedge of protection around President Trump and around all those that are supporting him and around America and the world that you stop the nuclear war they're trying to start.
[01:05:12.917 --> 01:05:27.220]  We pray in the name of your son Jesus Christ and we believe it and we know it and we know he died on the cross for our sins and paid the cost and went to hell and took the keys to death and hell and returned them
[01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.511]  From hell for us.
[01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:42.938]  And we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ, your sacrificial lamb, your son, the son of God, we ask in Jesus Christ's name that you put up a hedge of protection now.
[01:05:43.238 --> 01:05:50.922]  In fact, we know that you have guaranteed us that if we seek your face and repent and are genuine in this, you will deliver us.
[01:05:51.002 --> 01:05:57.025]  And we seek you now, God, humbly in the name of your son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.889]  We beg you, God, to forgive us for our sins and put up a hedge of protection.
[01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:08.272]  And we are so thankful that this enemy attack was thwarted by your angels.
[01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:15.435]  Amen.
[01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.555]  Guys, I'll come back in a minute.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.543]  Yeah, well, prayer is the right move.
[01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:24.027]  And some of these things are really out of our hands.
[01:06:24.408 --> 01:06:32.819]  And I know that we as human beings are the instruments of God just as much as we are the instruments of the devil, depending on how we choose to live.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:43.564]  But our power is limited, and we can only do so much, and things like what we witnessed today, Harrison, I think really are evidence of God's intervention.
[01:06:43.584 --> 01:06:45.645]  You know, so many of our founding fathers were deists.
[01:06:45.685 --> 01:06:48.826]  They believed in God, but they didn't believe it was intervention.
[01:06:49.386 --> 01:06:50.467]  Can I say something right now?
[01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:50.947]  Go ahead.
[01:06:51.047 --> 01:06:51.867]  Can I just say something right now?
[01:06:51.887 --> 01:06:52.507]  Can you guys hear me?
[01:06:52.727 --> 01:06:53.128]  Yes, sir.
[01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:54.928]  I want to say something right now.
[01:06:54.948 --> 01:06:56.469]  I want to say, that's what I'm saying is,
[01:06:57.408 --> 01:06:59.331]  I'm not trying to be the guy that has all the answers.
[01:06:59.751 --> 01:07:01.053]  I've already been on three or four shows.
[01:07:01.093 --> 01:07:02.455]  I've already uploaded four or five videos.
[01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:04.378]  I'm watching everybody out there.
[01:07:04.398 --> 01:07:05.799]  Oh, this is great for Trump.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.522]  Oh, we really are going to win now.
[01:07:07.922 --> 01:07:10.285]  They're going to go for broke now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:10.546 --> 01:07:13.109]  This is a spiritual war, and this is Satan.
[01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:15.292]  This was Satan trying to kill Trump.
[01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:17.919]  Because he got rid of Roe v. Wade.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.100]  He's trying to protect the children.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.820]  He's not perfect.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.341]  But God raises up people like him.
[01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:22.201]  Look at the Bible.
[01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:22.741]  Look at history.
[01:07:23.241 --> 01:07:26.142]  We literally dodged a bullet together today.
[01:07:26.202 --> 01:07:27.783]  And Donald Trump got grazed by a bullet.
[01:07:28.183 --> 01:07:30.764]  And we better—because I'm not bitching.
[01:07:30.824 --> 01:07:35.305]  I'm saying I don't see anybody saying, thank God he didn't die today.
[01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:36.686]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:39.927]  I'm just simply saying we better get on our knees.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.781]  We better get on our knees, because we're like, oh, it'll blow up bigger if they killed him.
[01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:46.301]  No, folks, they're coming after everybody.
[01:07:46.802 --> 01:07:50.543]  I told you, when they try to kill him, that means they're going for broke.
[01:07:51.003 --> 01:07:52.143]  World War III, people.
[01:07:52.483 --> 01:07:54.004]  I got five, I got four children.
[01:07:54.984 --> 01:07:56.184]  And I got a family to take care of.
[01:07:56.204 --> 01:07:57.245]  And I'm pissed about this.
[01:07:57.305 --> 01:07:58.405]  This is dangerous.
[01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.806]  So everybody out there, oh, God, they didn't kill him.
[01:08:00.886 --> 01:08:01.446]  Oh, we're winning.
[01:08:01.726 --> 01:08:03.067]  No, folks, we are winning.
[01:08:03.087 --> 01:08:03.867]  That's how desperate they are.
[01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:05.267]  But it shows how desperate they are.
[01:08:05.307 --> 01:08:08.888]  So we better get our asses in gear right now.
[01:08:09.408 --> 01:08:10.789]  And I'm not trying to tell you guys what to do.
[01:08:11.698 --> 01:08:15.762]  I know you're both Christians, but if you feel led to do it, I think we should open the phones up.
[01:08:15.782 --> 01:08:16.663]  Everybody should say prayers.
[01:08:18.104 --> 01:08:19.905]  Harrison, do you want to say a prayer for Trump in America?
[01:08:21.427 --> 01:08:22.608]  Chase Geiser, do you want to say a prayer?
[01:08:22.628 --> 01:08:24.149]  Because this is about God right now.
[01:08:24.610 --> 01:08:32.957]  God defended Trump today and just gave us an idea of what would have happened if those angels wouldn't have turned that bullet just a few inches away.
[01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:36.000]  We better be thanking our angels right now.
[01:08:37.478 --> 01:08:38.359]  I mean, think about it, Alex.
[01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.183]  This guy, this shooter, we're hearing 400 feet away.
[01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:43.964]  He had all the time in the world.
[01:08:44.545 --> 01:08:47.628]  He had two, two and a half minutes, we're hearing, up on that roof.
[01:08:47.668 --> 01:08:49.109]  Oh, I could shoot bullseye.
[01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:55.976]  I could shoot a two-inch, a two-inch target group at 400 yards all day.
[01:08:56.016 --> 01:08:58.638]  I could shoot a six-inch group at 800 yards.
[01:08:59.299 --> 01:09:00.900]  I'm not, Harrison, I'm not on your ass.
[01:09:01.841 --> 01:09:02.442]  I'm just saying,
[01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:05.298]  You love God, Harrison.
[01:09:05.398 --> 01:09:05.918]  I know you do.
[01:09:06.538 --> 01:09:07.318]  Say a prayer, Harrison.
[01:09:07.358 --> 01:09:07.619]  Come on.
[01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:08.059]  Right now.
[01:09:09.239 --> 01:09:17.783]  No, I thank God for sparing us from what could have happened, and I pray that the American people wake up before it's too late.
[01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:18.103]  I do.
[01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:18.563]  I pray
[01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:38.736]  That God opens the eyes of the American people to understand the evil that we're up against, and that's not a game, and that's not something you can shrug and roll your eyes at, and that's not just something happening that nobody has control over, but understanding that we're up against evil, that we're up against a desperate foe whose
[01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:45.118]  Doesn't know mercy, doesn't know backing down, doesn't know turning the other cheek.
[01:09:45.378 --> 01:09:52.502]  They don't know these things, and I pray to God that it's our embrace of these things that can save us.
[01:09:52.562 --> 01:09:55.844]  I totally agree, and I think Trump needs to call on God, which he's starting to do.
[01:09:56.945 --> 01:10:00.727]  Chase, I mean, I'm not trying to put you on the spot here, but now is the time to call on God.
[01:10:01.227 --> 01:10:03.449]  I'm not telling you to say a prayer unless you feel like you should do it.
[01:10:03.589 --> 01:10:04.249]  I'll say a prayer.
[01:10:04.349 --> 01:10:07.792]  It reminds me specifically of one of my favorite poems, which is a prayer.
[01:10:08.052 --> 01:10:08.572]  Invictus.
[01:10:09.313 --> 01:10:11.994]  Out of the night that covers me, black is the pit from pole to pole.
[01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:15.176]  I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.
[01:10:15.717 --> 01:10:18.639]  In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud.
[01:10:19.059 --> 01:10:22.882]  Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloodied but unbowed.
[01:10:23.502 --> 01:10:23.942]  Beautifully said.
[01:10:24.162 --> 01:10:26.263]  And the reason I'm doing this, folks, is this is a spiritual battle.
[01:10:26.363 --> 01:10:27.924]  If we don't have God, we have nothing.
[01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:28.484]  But with God, Rob,
[01:10:48.908 --> 01:10:49.749]  We should pray for Trump.
[01:10:49.809 --> 01:10:50.729]  Everybody should pray for Trump.
[01:10:50.749 --> 01:10:52.211]  I want the phones open for Trump.
[01:11:09.984 --> 01:11:23.327]  We really did dodge a bullet today, and we definitely, we all need to, especially tonight as we see our kids, because this is all their future that we're relying, that they're relying on us to give them a future.
[01:11:24.307 --> 01:11:28.908]  And that future was almost stolen from us today.
[01:11:30.608 --> 01:11:35.489]  But by the hand of God, turn Trump's head right at the last second, and that bullet grazed his ear.
[01:11:37.288 --> 01:11:48.471]  Big ups to the big man out there who I think literally brought his hand down to stop and sway Trump just a micro inch to stop that.
[01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:50.631]  That didn't even get hit to show us how serious it is.
[01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:51.271]  Exactly.
[01:11:51.832 --> 01:11:53.272]  It wasn't just an assassination attempt.
[01:11:53.312 --> 01:11:54.732]  Now he was hit by a bullet.
[01:11:55.212 --> 01:12:01.814]  And then you have Forbes magazine out there saying, oh, there was an incident and Trump was rushed away from stage and looked like he had some blood on him.
[01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:04.653]  These people know no bounds.
[01:12:04.733 --> 01:12:08.695]  They truly are enemies of humanity and enemies of free people everywhere.
[01:12:08.835 --> 01:12:09.235]  Say a prayer.
[01:12:09.775 --> 01:12:11.616]  Say a prayer, Rob.
[01:12:11.656 --> 01:12:15.857]  I don't even know if I'm going through.
[01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:16.358]  I can't hear.
[01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.458]  Oh yeah, you're going through.
[01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:18.399]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:19.059]  Am I going through?
[01:12:19.159 --> 01:12:22.060]  Okay, you're just being quiet.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:29.203]  Heavenly Father, thank you for giving Trump the discernment and the insight
[01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:30.559]  And we thank you.
[01:12:53.214 --> 01:13:00.178]  Forgiving us this day, because this is going to rally all of America now, and the whole world's going to rally around Trump and what he's trying to do.
[01:13:00.278 --> 01:13:11.063]  And we're going to cut through all the garbage and all the BS and all the Project 2025 and everything else that they're trying to do to distract you from what's really going on, which is a spiritual war.
[01:13:11.103 --> 01:13:12.864]  That is where we're at right now.
[01:13:13.424 --> 01:13:14.665]  People are going to choose sides.
[01:13:15.605 --> 01:13:18.627]  We thank you for showing us that we have to choose sides today.
[01:13:18.747 --> 01:13:22.889]  This is the day that we all have to choose sides.
[01:13:24.395 --> 01:13:26.796]  In your mercy, amen.
[01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:27.457]  Amen.
[01:13:27.557 --> 01:13:33.981]  And you know, I don't know if Alex can hear me, but I had the same thought that Alex did.
[01:13:34.301 --> 01:13:40.384]  Even just for like coming into the studios, you know, it's like when 9-11 happens, you think like, oh I need to be with my family right now.
[01:13:40.485 --> 01:13:42.025]  You know, we don't know what comes next.
[01:13:43.026 --> 01:13:48.209]  Because I totally agree, and I'll say this again once Alex gets the earbuds back in.
[01:13:48.309 --> 01:13:49.110]  Alex, I was just saying,
[01:13:50.191 --> 01:14:00.139]  I completely agree with you that my response to this, obviously it's a brief elation that Donald Trump survived and was only grazed, but my immediate next thought was, okay, what's next?
[01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.160]  They're going to go crazy.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:05.563]  Should I even leave my home right now or should I be with my family at this moment?
[01:14:06.344 --> 01:14:09.406]  I got extreme trepidation about what comes next.
[01:14:10.267 --> 01:14:13.249]  Harrison, you are protecting your family on air right now.
[01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.211]  This is so important.
[01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.653]  You guys should stay there for the next two days live.
[01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:23.563]  I mean, we cannot take this like, oh, it's an incident like Forbes and AP and Reuters said, no big deal.
[01:14:24.163 --> 01:14:28.384]  Ladies and gentlemen, how many times have I said in the last three months, they're going to try to kill Trump.
[01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:30.464]  And if they get him, they're coming after everybody.
[01:14:30.524 --> 01:14:31.444]  This is a coup.
[01:14:32.925 --> 01:14:35.705]  This is a total coup against humanity.
[01:14:35.765 --> 01:14:37.005]  This is their move.
[01:14:37.465 --> 01:14:38.206]  We are winning.
[01:14:38.246 --> 01:14:39.586]  Humanity is fighting back.
[01:14:40.666 --> 01:14:45.707]  So the reason that I asked you to pray and asked Rob to pray is because
[01:14:47.287 --> 01:14:48.287]  I don't wanna be the one saying this.
[01:14:48.327 --> 01:14:51.589]  I don't wanna be like, I see everybody, no one's saying pray for Trump.
[01:14:52.569 --> 01:14:55.490]  They're like, oh great, we'll really win now.
[01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:59.752]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the enemy is going full on now.
[01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:03.874]  The enemy is going full on right now.
[01:15:04.694 --> 01:15:07.315]  And so we have to recognize it's God.
[01:15:07.895 --> 01:15:09.196]  We have to pray to God.
[01:15:09.736 --> 01:15:11.057]  So I'm gonna come back in a little while.
[01:15:11.277 --> 01:15:16.199]  I'm gonna say a prayer and put it up to X. Everything we're putting out right now, it's like three, four, five million views.
[01:15:17.163 --> 01:15:22.651]  And I'm going to say a prayer for Trump and ask people to pray for Trump because the power of prayer is real.
[01:15:22.912 --> 01:15:27.759]  You open the bridge, the gate to the internal and to God.
[01:15:28.119 --> 01:15:30.082]  And that is the thing that will override the enemy.
[01:15:30.362 --> 01:15:33.427]  We need to pray for Trump to be given discernment.
[01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:40.035]  And for God to lead, guide and direct Trump, because he's an imperfect servant like all of us, but he is amazing.
[01:15:40.556 --> 01:15:43.117]  And the enemy hates him because he's not against humanity.
[01:15:43.317 --> 01:15:50.761]  And when he got shot in the side of the head, he pushed the Secret Service off and said, fight, fight, fight.
[01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:55.744]  And then the media tried to spin that, which will be even a bigger detriment to them.
[01:15:56.464 --> 01:15:57.725]  These people are scum.
[01:15:57.745 --> 01:16:00.567]  They're willing to do anything because Trump will end World War III.
[01:16:01.519 --> 01:16:06.104]  When he is sworn in on January 21st, 2025.
[01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:09.988]  And that's why they are in such a panic mode.
[01:16:10.008 --> 01:16:15.073]  That's why everybody says, oh, there's 112 days or 14 days or whatever it is, the election.
[01:16:15.553 --> 01:16:17.175]  It's the 79 days of hell.
[01:16:18.479 --> 01:16:22.782]  In early November to January 21st, that they're going to pull out all the stops.
[01:16:23.262 --> 01:16:25.544]  And so, I don't do this show as a game.
[01:16:25.924 --> 01:16:27.345]  I don't do this to play games.
[01:16:27.745 --> 01:16:29.466]  I don't do this to sit there and run my mouth.
[01:16:29.787 --> 01:16:32.348]  I don't put up with these attacks because I think it's cute.
[01:16:33.049 --> 01:16:33.829]  I know the enemy.
[01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:35.250]  And I know how to beat them.
[01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:37.291]  Because God is with me.
[01:16:38.112 --> 01:16:41.334]  As imperfect as I am, I am literally in God's presence.
[01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:43.536]  And God tells me what's going to happen.
[01:16:44.196 --> 01:16:46.998]  And God is telling me we better pray right now
[01:16:48.869 --> 01:16:57.935]  And we better understand that we're on the edge of nuclear war and destruction of life on this planet as we know it if we don't stop these people.
[01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.236]  Now, we don't want to be violent.
[01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:01.877]  What did I say?
[01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:15.665]  A hundred times last month, when they kill Trump or try to kill Trump, they will then stage truck bombings and attacks on black churches and racist attacks and blame Trump whether they kill him or not.
[01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:16.526]  So,
[01:17:17.754 --> 01:17:21.576]  They're loading truck bombs right now to bomb black churches.
[01:17:22.356 --> 01:17:26.018]  They've got the brainwashed white supremacist shooters ready to go into black churches.
[01:17:27.259 --> 01:17:28.340]  They've all pre-programmed it.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:34.803]  I don't want to prove how right I am again to the FBI, to the Secret Service, the federal marshals.
[01:17:34.903 --> 01:17:35.543]  I know a lot of you.
[01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:36.544]  A lot of you are good men and women.
[01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:38.125]  You know this is happening.
[01:17:38.845 --> 01:17:39.906]  I go to federal courthouses.
[01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:41.226]  They're great people.
[01:17:41.246 --> 01:17:41.827]  I shake their hands.
[01:17:41.847 --> 01:17:42.567]  They're not bad people.
[01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:43.768]  The government's not our enemy.
[01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:44.368]  It's been hijacked.
[01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:46.655]  But you need to blow the whistle.
[01:17:47.135 --> 01:17:50.797]  You need to speak out because this is going down right now.
[01:17:51.638 --> 01:18:03.845]  But the good news is, as Patrick Benjamin said earlier when I was on with Mario Fall and his crew and Nick Sartor, they're seeing people across the board support Trump that never did publicly.
[01:18:04.326 --> 01:18:05.726]  People understand what's happening.
[01:18:05.746 --> 01:18:07.187]  So I'm going to let you guys go back to the live show.
[01:18:07.207 --> 01:18:11.510]  I appreciate the crew coming on Saturday night, but this is history happening.
[01:18:13.001 --> 01:18:22.267]  If you, if we won't stand and go 24 hours for Trump, when he got shot in the head, then we won't stand for ourselves when the time comes.
[01:18:22.327 --> 01:18:25.449]  All these big mouths, oh, I see you in helmets, I go to war.
[01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.191]  Oh, I'm ready to kill people.
[01:18:28.491 --> 01:18:28.691]  No!
[01:18:29.532 --> 01:18:41.640]  If you won't stand up and speak out and just stand against evil, and if you won't stay on air, I'm talking about all of us, and if listeners won't support what we're doing, I'm going to say this right now, I only say this because
[01:18:42.344 --> 01:18:42.804]  It's the truth.
[01:18:44.205 --> 01:18:47.267]  And I don't, in a way, it's very, very empowering.
[01:18:47.967 --> 01:18:50.109]  It's very cathartic, but I'm out of money.
[01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:59.994]  And I don't care about being personally out of money, except money is a, the currency I use to fight the enemy.
[01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:03.336]  We need people to go to mfoldwarsstore.com.
[01:19:03.637 --> 01:19:04.517]  We need you to buy the products.
[01:19:04.537 --> 01:19:05.978]  We need you to go to drjonesandactuals.com.
[01:19:06.118 --> 01:19:09.240]  We need you to go, my God, these people are fighting for us.
[01:19:10.097 --> 01:19:15.639]  If people don't see that we've been right, if people don't see we can't be bought, if people don't see we don't back down, if people don't back us,
[01:19:36.596 --> 01:19:38.177]  That's your problem, and I'm not mad at people.
[01:19:38.537 --> 01:19:39.377]  It's all in God's plan.
[01:19:39.437 --> 01:19:45.160]  I have learned that God is in control, and God always keeps me humble, like the widows might.
[01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:50.443]  But I need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the InfoWars MD line of great products.
[01:19:51.243 --> 01:19:56.466]  I need you to go to DrJonesNationals.com because you saw them in the news in the last two months.
[01:19:56.566 --> 01:19:57.766]  We're shutting down next week.
[01:19:58.727 --> 01:19:59.747]  First, they said it wasn't happening.
[01:19:59.767 --> 01:20:00.868]  They were like, yeah, we're shutting them down.
[01:20:01.748 --> 01:20:03.169]  The sheriffs are coming to lock the doors.
[01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.110]  Then a federal judge came through and blocked it.
[01:20:05.911 --> 01:20:08.033]  The federal judge has a plan for us to continue on.
[01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:15.201]  But if we're not profitable, if we're not making money, which we are literally on the edge of red and black right now, then we won't be here.
[01:20:15.502 --> 01:20:16.403]  So it's so simple.
[01:20:16.863 --> 01:20:23.050]  Get products you need that are amazing, support the broadcast, and be part of history.
[01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:23.951]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:20:23.971 --> 01:20:25.233]  But I'm not mad at people.
[01:20:25.593 --> 01:20:27.335]  I'm just blessed you tuned in.
[01:20:28.689 --> 01:20:34.555]  But the fact that you watch so many entertainment channels and so many shows, this is the broadcast that told the truth.
[01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:37.217]  This is the broadcast that hit the number.
[01:20:37.537 --> 01:20:39.459]  This is the broadcast that predicted it all.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.442]  We cannot fight this evil without you.
[01:20:42.782 --> 01:20:49.809]  DRJonesNationals.com, InfoWarsTore.com, but even if you're not going to support us and get great products at the same time, fine.
[01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:57.161]  Please take the live feed at RealAlexJones on X. Please take the feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:57.641 --> 01:21:04.805]  Please at least boost that because we are fighting with everything we've got and we need your support.
[01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:10.467]  We've got a building and crew and satellite uplinks and encoders and bandwidth costs.
[01:21:10.767 --> 01:21:12.488]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars a month just for bandwidth.
[01:21:12.688 --> 01:21:13.969]  We reach tens of millions a day.
[01:21:14.838 --> 01:21:15.839]  We're fighting.
[01:21:16.059 --> 01:21:16.820]  We need you.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.082]  This isn't some fiction show.
[01:21:19.122 --> 01:21:20.803]  This isn't some NFL program.
[01:21:21.163 --> 01:21:23.125]  This isn't some Netflix program.
[01:21:23.365 --> 01:21:24.586]  These are real people.
[01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:25.427]  I'm real.
[01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:26.608]  As real as it gets.
[01:21:27.488 --> 01:21:28.549]  And I need your support.
[01:21:28.569 --> 01:21:34.734]  And I humbly ask you now to make the decision to go to drjonesandaxels.com and buy the products.
[01:21:35.215 --> 01:21:38.998]  And go to m4warshore.com and get M4WarsMD and support us.
[01:21:39.558 --> 01:21:41.440]  And let me tell you, they shut us down in a couple months.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.641]  That's what the judge said.
[01:21:43.351 --> 01:21:44.592]  If we don't get support, we'll shut down?
[01:21:45.193 --> 01:21:47.576]  You're gonna freak out and say, oh my god, we didn't know it was real.
[01:21:47.856 --> 01:21:49.297]  People say, why are you still on air?
[01:21:49.498 --> 01:21:51.139]  Because we're hard to kill!
[01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:55.764]  I mean, people keep saying, it's in the news, you're shut down this week, why aren't you?
[01:21:56.004 --> 01:22:00.729]  Because God's on our side, you're supporting us, we're hard to kill!
[01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:03.933]  You guys just popped in, what?
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.462]  I'm sorry, we should have been on technical issues.
[01:22:08.482 --> 01:22:09.042]  Sorry about that, Alex.
[01:22:09.062 --> 01:22:09.782]  Sorry, technical issue.
[01:22:09.863 --> 01:22:12.624]  We're going to be setting up a space in just a little bit.
[01:22:12.664 --> 01:22:17.228]  But, you know, this is the exact type of event that they don't want InfoWars on air for.
[01:22:17.428 --> 01:22:17.648]  Yes.
[01:22:19.749 --> 01:22:20.210]  Exactly.
[01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:22.611]  That's why they want us on air.
[01:22:22.631 --> 01:22:30.137]  I won't tell the whole story, but federal officers outside of court order tried to silence us five weeks ago.
[01:22:30.877 --> 01:22:32.418]  They didn't do that for no reason.
[01:22:32.718 --> 01:22:34.700]  And I said at the time, I said, this is not about us.
[01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:35.942]  They're getting ready.
[01:22:35.982 --> 01:22:36.522]  What did I say?
[01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:37.722]  Have the archivists find it.
[01:22:38.003 --> 01:22:38.543]  What did I say?
[01:22:39.183 --> 01:22:43.003]  They're getting ready to kill Trump.
[01:22:44.184 --> 01:22:48.284]  And when they kill Trump, they don't want us on air.
[01:22:48.585 --> 01:22:49.725]  The archivists will have it.
[01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:50.125]  Get it.
[01:22:50.285 --> 01:22:50.865]  Get the clip.
[01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:55.226]  Because nobody cares about what I say now, but oh, everybody's amazed by it a month ago.
[01:22:56.006 --> 01:23:01.407]  They don't want us on air when they kill Trump or when they fail.
[01:23:02.626 --> 01:23:04.126]  And they just failed.
[01:23:04.386 --> 01:23:06.607]  And they don't want me on air when they announce a bird flu.
[01:23:07.367 --> 01:23:08.587]  And they don't want our crew.
[01:23:08.727 --> 01:23:11.268]  Guys, this is so ridiculous.
[01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:12.488]  I'm not bitching.
[01:23:13.128 --> 01:23:14.008]  It's all God's plan.
[01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.489]  But I can't believe that we don't have billions of dollars instead of barely paying our bills.
[01:23:18.549 --> 01:23:22.270]  And I have $4,000 in the bank and can't even pay my electricity bill.
[01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:24.451]  And the left goes, oh, look, he can't pay his electricity bill.
[01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:25.811]  I don't give a shit about that.
[01:23:26.696 --> 01:23:31.178]  But literally, literally, I went to my daddy two days ago and I said, Dad, can I have $10,000?
[01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:33.059]  He said, of course, son, how much do you need?
[01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:35.760]  And I said, well, I'm out of money.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:36.641]  He goes, here's a $10,000 check, son.
[01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:40.202]  And I was like, oh, look, you don't have money.
[01:23:40.222 --> 01:23:42.103]  I don't care about that.
[01:23:42.663 --> 01:23:46.265]  But I'm literally down to my daddy.
[01:23:47.073 --> 01:23:48.174]  I'm paying my bills.
[01:23:48.214 --> 01:23:49.214]  The left celebrates it.
[01:23:49.554 --> 01:23:50.875]  I'm trying to stop World War III.
[01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.596]  I'm trying to stop the new world order.
[01:23:53.117 --> 01:23:57.319]  And I'm looking at millions of people watching right now and saying, would you go get a great supplement?
[01:23:57.819 --> 01:24:00.301]  Would you go get CoQ10 or PQQ?
[01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:02.242]  Would you get nano silver toothpaste?
[01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:02.942]  Would you?
[01:24:02.962 --> 01:24:04.323]  They're all, it's all badass.
[01:24:04.883 --> 01:24:10.367]  And it's like, history is, so I don't blame people, but God is watching you.
[01:24:10.827 --> 01:24:14.989]  If you don't support us, you don't support yourself.
[01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.790]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:17.444]  Because I love you guys.
[01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.725]  But it is beyond bizarre.
[01:24:21.066 --> 01:24:22.346]  I keep saying it's less than a percent.
[01:24:22.867 --> 01:24:25.608]  It's one-tenth of one percent ever buy things.
[01:24:26.488 --> 01:24:27.969]  We reach like 30 million people a day.
[01:24:27.989 --> 01:24:29.349]  10 million on the show.
[01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:34.711]  10 million people tune in and I sell a thousand bottles of product?
[01:24:35.252 --> 01:24:35.872]  I'm not pitching.
[01:24:35.992 --> 01:24:38.313]  It's like, what the hell world is this?
[01:24:38.793 --> 01:24:42.755]  Like a thousand bottles we make and pay the bills?
[01:24:45.016 --> 01:24:45.536]  It's so...
[01:24:46.337 --> 01:24:47.238]  Paradoxical.
[01:24:47.378 --> 01:24:48.419]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:24:48.499 --> 01:24:50.500]  I'm just like, they just shot Trump!
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:53.242]  Like, I told you they would do it, man!
[01:24:53.903 --> 01:24:55.044]  I'm willing to die for the truth.
[01:24:55.504 --> 01:24:56.224]  I won't back down.
[01:24:57.045 --> 01:24:58.746]  But then I depend on you.
[01:24:59.967 --> 01:25:01.168]  And I sit here and I beg.
[01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:02.169]  I'm like, please.
[01:25:03.069 --> 01:25:05.371]  I'm like a pit bull in a dog fight.
[01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:07.072]  I'm like, I'll eat the dogs.
[01:25:07.793 --> 01:25:08.754]  I will chew them up.
[01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:09.995]  I will spit them out.
[01:25:10.075 --> 01:25:10.875]  I'm meaner than hell.
[01:25:11.396 --> 01:25:13.057]  But man, if you don't give me dog food,
[01:25:14.574 --> 01:25:15.255]  I won't be able to fight.
[01:25:15.835 --> 01:25:16.996]  So I'm done complaining.
[01:25:17.437 --> 01:25:18.718]  I wish we saw a big surge.
[01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.380]  I don't want to worry about money.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.304]  I don't want to sit here in this critical time and beg and sit here and plead.
[01:25:24.444 --> 01:25:25.905]  I just need support.
[01:25:26.106 --> 01:25:29.909]  I mean, my God, my God, my God, this is so simple.
[01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:31.371]  This is so simple.
[01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:34.114]  And God is taking me right down to the moment of destruction.
[01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:40.896]  Because God is going to deliver us, just like he keeps doing, when they were going to shut us down the last five weeks six different times.
[01:25:41.396 --> 01:25:43.537]  And so that's where we are.
[01:25:43.557 --> 01:25:44.417]  So I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:25:44.437 --> 01:25:45.697]  I'm going to come back later.
[01:25:46.158 --> 01:25:47.198]  But pray for Trump.
[01:25:47.538 --> 01:25:48.358]  Pray for America.
[01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:49.199]  Pray for freedom.
[01:25:49.539 --> 01:25:52.340]  Because the enemy is desperate, and all bets are off.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.260]  Guys, take over.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:53.620]  I'll be back.
[01:25:55.103 --> 01:25:56.064]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:56.084 --> 01:26:02.148]  And let me just say, drjonesnaturals.com has absolutely fantastic products.
[01:26:02.208 --> 01:26:06.250]  I just want to reinforce that it's not even charity, like it's not even hard.
[01:26:06.311 --> 01:26:07.311]  It's not even like we're just asking.
[01:26:07.331 --> 01:26:12.775]  I listen to a podcast and they always say, you know, if what you just heard was worth a buck, we'd love to have it.
[01:26:12.795 --> 01:26:13.936]  That's kind of how we are, right?
[01:26:13.976 --> 01:26:21.721]  We do 10 hours plus of live content a day, plus all the content creators at Bandod Video and Infowars.com, all the great writers.
[01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:24.303]  I mean, and all of this is brought to you by
[01:26:25.563 --> 01:26:33.107]  Go to Mike Adams, I'm just gonna say this.
[01:26:33.887 --> 01:26:39.710]  Listen, Harrison, go to Mike Adams, I'll come back.
[01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:44.453]  But listen, do people expect us to take on the New World Order with no support?
[01:26:44.553 --> 01:26:45.213]  I'm not bitching.
[01:26:46.019 --> 01:26:55.948]  I'm just like at a certain point I'm like what the hell do you like we've had all these devastating victories against the enemy and we're just sitting here begging as we're being hammered like the Alamo for support.
[01:26:55.968 --> 01:26:56.649]  I'm not bitching.
[01:26:56.909 --> 01:27:03.174]  I'm just saying I would not spend my time begging if I didn't need the funds to continue the damn war.
[01:27:03.595 --> 01:27:05.576]  Support us in the war now!
[01:27:05.596 --> 01:27:07.278]  Mike Adams.
[01:27:09.608 --> 01:27:16.076]  Mike Adams' run audio test to try to determine more information from the video that we have.
[01:27:16.116 --> 01:27:17.358]  Guys, do we have Mike Adams?
[01:27:17.558 --> 01:27:18.259]  I see he's connected.
[01:27:18.279 --> 01:27:19.601]  I'm not sure if he can hear me yet.
[01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:24.186]  Mike, thank you so much for joining us here.
[01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:25.909]  What have you discovered?
[01:27:27.373 --> 01:27:27.893]  All right, guys.
[01:27:28.093 --> 01:27:36.575]  Yeah, so if you can, if your control board guys can pull up from my Twitter account, Health Ranger, there's a graphic there of the audio file, the WAVE file.
[01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:38.656]  It's one of the most recent posts.
[01:27:39.196 --> 01:27:47.337]  So this is, we got to cut off the claims that this was a hoax, because the left is going to claim it was a, it was a hoax.
[01:27:47.397 --> 01:27:49.638]  It didn't actually happen, that there wasn't a real shooting.
[01:27:50.450 --> 01:28:07.960]  I've done an audio analysis, forensic audio analysis, using the speed of sound as well as the typical speed, feet per second, of a 5.56 round, even though we don't know for sure the, you know, the number of grains of that round or how long the barrel was, we can estimate that at 2,500 feet per second.
[01:28:08.761 --> 01:28:17.966]  And if you look at the audio file, and again, I posted this on my Twitter account there, understand that these bullets are hypersonic.
[01:28:18.624 --> 01:28:29.370]  That the impact of the bullets, if you're at the point or close to the point where the shooting is arriving, then the bullets arrive before the sound of the gun is heard.
[01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:36.373]  Because the bullets are moving at 2,500 feet per second, the speed of sound is like 1,125 feet per second.
[01:28:36.834 --> 01:28:45.238]  Now, if you take the timing difference between those two audio events, which is the impact and then the actual report of the rifle,
[01:28:46.135 --> 01:28:49.899]  And I've measured that in the audio software here at 0.22 seconds.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:29:05.197]  If you do the algebra on that using the numbers I mentioned, the typical rifle velocity, muzzle velocity of 2,500 feet per second on a 5.56 round, typically like a 62 grain round, then you get a distance of the shooter at about 450 feet.
[01:29:06.693 --> 01:29:16.078]  And I put that out just as the shooter's location was being identified with the police estimating he was at 125 yards or 375 feet.
[01:29:16.098 --> 01:29:18.900]  By the way, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, stay there.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.241]  I love, what a great scientist.
[01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:22.522]  What a great brain.
[01:29:22.602 --> 01:29:23.943]  What an incredible person, Mike Adams.
[01:29:23.983 --> 01:29:24.583]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:29:25.063 --> 01:29:26.524]  Mike Adams is going to start over right now.
[01:29:26.544 --> 01:29:27.385]  I'm going to take this club.
[01:29:27.785 --> 01:29:29.806]  We're going to put this on X. I want you to start over, Mike.
[01:29:30.246 --> 01:29:31.446]  But exactly.
[01:29:31.827 --> 01:29:34.787]  Forbes calls it an incident, claims he fell down and hit his knee.
[01:29:35.188 --> 01:29:36.588]  He was hit by a bullet.
[01:29:38.068 --> 01:29:49.612]  The greatest winner of Oscars could not do the Secret Service and the bullets killing people and hitting Trump on the side of the head.
[01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.492]  It was totally real.
[01:29:51.572 --> 01:29:52.032]  You're right.
[01:29:52.533 --> 01:29:53.633]  They're trying to say
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:30:00.883]  That it was an incident or it was staged, which shows how pathetic they are and how crazy they are.
[01:30:00.923 --> 01:30:01.984]  So Mike, start over.
[01:30:02.004 --> 01:30:07.987]  We're going to put this out and explain that this was real, but it was obviously real.
[01:30:08.407 --> 01:30:12.989]  You could see it and Trump defiantly saying, fight, fight, fight.
[01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:16.671]  But again, this to me shows how sick these people are.
[01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.572]  Mike, start over.
[01:30:18.252 --> 01:30:21.794]  At the beginning, Mike Adams, the health ranger, great scientist, great brain.
[01:30:25.811 --> 01:30:36.836]  Okay, this is an audio forensic analysis of the assassination attempt of President Trump.
[01:30:37.636 --> 01:30:42.738]  And the reason I even did this was because I received texts from some people who were questioning, was this even real?
[01:30:42.778 --> 01:30:47.020]  Because they said it looked like Trump, his hand went up to his ear too quickly.
[01:30:47.874 --> 01:30:51.135]  Like, there's no way he could have reacted that fast from the time they heard the gunshot.
[01:30:51.315 --> 01:31:01.016]  Well, of course, all of us know, if we know anything about ballistics, that the rifle rounds are themselves hypersonic, so they travel faster than the speed of sound.
[01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:17.399]  When an impact from a bullet arrives at your local location, it is followed by the sound of the rifle shot, and the time difference between those two audio events can be used to estimate the distance of the shooter.
[01:31:18.214 --> 01:31:20.895]  And this cannot be faked, because you can't fake the speed of sound.
[01:31:20.935 --> 01:31:22.395]  You can't change the laws of physics.
[01:31:22.996 --> 01:31:26.617]  So what I did, I took the audio of this event, and it's very clear.
[01:31:26.677 --> 01:31:30.858]  You can hear impacts, and then you can hear the reports of the gun.
[01:31:30.898 --> 01:31:32.419]  And again, I posted this on Twitter.
[01:31:32.979 --> 01:31:36.560]  I've got a little graphic there if you go to my second or third post at HealthRanger.
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.602]  You'll see the graphic I indicated.
[01:31:38.642 --> 01:31:41.364]  This is the impact and these are the reports from the rifle.
[01:31:41.725 --> 01:31:48.952]  If you measure the time difference between those two events, and there's multiple examples of this, it's 0.22 seconds.
[01:31:49.672 --> 01:31:59.282]  If you take 0.22 seconds and you do the algebra on the assumption that the speed of sound is 1,125 feet per second, which I know varies based on air density and so on,
[01:32:00.057 --> 01:32:01.758]  But we're trying to get rough numbers here.
[01:32:01.918 --> 01:32:07.902]  And then if you take the muzzle velocity of a typical AR-15 round, a 5.56 round, typically 62 grain.
[01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:11.104]  Again, we don't know for sure that's it, but that's a pretty good guess.
[01:32:11.144 --> 01:32:15.527]  With a 16-inch barrel, you're going to get about 2,500 feet per second right out of the muzzle.
[01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:19.649]  That speed drops off over time, but it's not that far of a shot.
[01:32:20.029 --> 01:32:21.710]  So we're going to keep it at 2,500.
[01:32:22.711 --> 01:32:23.872]  If you do the math on this,
[01:32:24.685 --> 01:32:32.347]  It turns out that, mathematically, from the audio forensics, this shooter was roughly 450 feet away.
[01:32:33.008 --> 01:32:37.729]  Now, this is consistent with what has been observed about that shooter on that rooftop.
[01:32:37.989 --> 01:32:42.271]  Again, now law enforcement has identified him as estimated 125 yards.
[01:32:42.651 --> 01:32:44.911]  Multiply that by three to get feet, obviously.
[01:32:45.512 --> 01:32:49.253]  So, this shooter was hundreds of feet away.
[01:32:49.313 --> 01:32:49.433]  Like,
[01:32:50.488 --> 01:32:52.409]  More than a football field away, okay?
[01:32:52.749 --> 01:32:56.831]  And that is why the bullets arrive before the sound arrives.
[01:32:57.451 --> 01:33:08.596]  And that's also, by the way, that shot, Alex, as you know, that shot at 400 and, let's say 400 to 450 feet, that is not a difficult shot for an accomplished rifleman.
[01:33:08.896 --> 01:33:09.336]  Not at all.
[01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:18.502]  I mean, I routinely warm up at 450 yards with a 4-inch steel plate with the rifles that I use, and that's just to make sure the trigger's working.
[01:33:18.522 --> 01:33:18.942]  You know what I mean?
[01:33:19.202 --> 01:33:20.403]  It's not a difficult shot.
[01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:26.968]  It's by the grace of God that this shot missed Trump's head and only grazed his ear.
[01:33:26.988 --> 01:33:27.988]  So, Mike, let me stop you.
[01:33:28.028 --> 01:33:28.649]  Let me stop you.
[01:33:28.849 --> 01:33:29.049]  Yes.
[01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.669]  Let me stop you.
[01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:35.173]  I want you to continue on, but you are one of the best political analysts I know, one of the smartest people I know.
[01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.194]  I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:38.680]  Let's move on from the shot.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.701]  We know they tried to kill him.
[01:33:39.861 --> 01:33:40.282]  It failed.
[01:33:41.002 --> 01:33:44.605]  Move back to that when you're ready, because I'm going to take a break here while I'm listening to you.
[01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:46.847]  But the Deep State has failed to kill him.
[01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.509]  It shows their desperation.
[01:33:48.989 --> 01:33:50.150]  What do you expect to come next?
[01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:52.552]  What do you make from just this event in general?
[01:33:53.012 --> 01:33:55.455]  Instead of, I get it, you got to say, oh yeah, they tried to kill him.
[01:33:55.535 --> 01:33:57.176]  OK, some idiots don't believe it.
[01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:58.657]  Yeah, we get it.
[01:33:58.737 --> 01:33:59.978]  I mean, it literally blew his ear off.
[01:34:00.459 --> 01:34:02.040]  So you can't fake that, man.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:05.243]  The blood, the Secret Service, like from fight, fight, fight, it's epic.
[01:34:05.823 --> 01:34:07.145]  What does this signify?
[01:34:07.185 --> 01:34:08.587]  This tells me they're going for broke.
[01:34:09.087 --> 01:34:11.510]  Everybody's like, oh great, he's going to re-elect him now, this backfired.
[01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.811]  No.
[01:34:12.211 --> 01:34:14.194]  This tells me they're going to go for broke.
[01:34:14.534 --> 01:34:15.535]  I'm very concerned.
[01:34:17.237 --> 01:34:18.018]  I think you're exactly right.
[01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:21.623]  This means we're going to have a false flag nuclear event in Europe.
[01:34:22.475 --> 01:34:28.320]  To be blamed on Russia, most likely, or a radiological dirty bomb nuclear attack in the U.S.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:35.005]  But I think Europe is more likely because they need World War III in order to cancel the election and do to America what they did to Ukraine.
[01:34:35.085 --> 01:34:35.426]  Exactly!
[01:34:35.506 --> 01:34:37.467]  And people keep thinking everything's okay.
[01:34:37.928 --> 01:34:39.409]  I'm not trying to be alarmist, folks.
[01:34:39.929 --> 01:34:42.812]  Dirty bombs, nukes, nuclear war, it's on.
[01:34:43.633 --> 01:34:44.714]  I could tell you exactly.
[01:34:44.754 --> 01:34:45.074]  We're here.
[01:34:45.314 --> 01:34:48.276]  Dirty bomb material has been smuggled into Ukraine.
[01:34:48.696 --> 01:34:52.218]  And do not forget that Zelensky is no longer the president of Ukraine.
[01:34:52.258 --> 01:34:53.539]  His term already expired.
[01:34:53.559 --> 01:34:54.820]  He's not an elected official.
[01:34:55.692 --> 01:34:57.714]  And there are no elections being held in Ukraine.
[01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:00.356]  They canceled them because they claimed we're in a war, right?
[01:35:00.896 --> 01:35:04.619]  So this is the model for what they're going to do in the United States of America.
[01:35:05.039 --> 01:35:14.546]  They know that by failing to kill Trump, but grazing him, not only will he have a huge bump in the polls, not only will he be more popular, he will be more determined.
[01:35:15.206 --> 01:35:19.870]  Alex, this will change Trump's personality from this point forward about what the
[01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:24.312]  His measure of passion and determination.
[01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:24.892]  What did you make of him?
[01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:25.793]  I agree.
[01:35:25.813 --> 01:35:29.234]  What did you make of him surging and just saying, fight, fight, fight?
[01:35:29.314 --> 01:35:33.035]  God, that image was like, so I'm glad I'm alive to see this.
[01:35:33.935 --> 01:35:34.495]  Historic.
[01:35:34.655 --> 01:35:35.195]  Absolutely historic.
[01:35:35.535 --> 01:35:42.557]  And I don't know who took that photo of the one that was taken, obviously, from a low angle of him with his fists raised and the American flag behind him in the air.
[01:35:43.078 --> 01:35:47.439]  My God, that is the most historic photo that any of us have ever lived through.
[01:35:48.832 --> 01:35:55.003]  If we had photos of William Travis dying at the Alamo, it's that powerful.
[01:35:58.542 --> 01:36:03.744]  Cause Trump supporters, number one, it's going to eliminate any kind of concerns.
[01:36:04.484 --> 01:36:10.086]  Even I have voiced some concerns about Trump positions, and so have you, Alex, over time.
[01:36:10.386 --> 01:36:12.087]  Those have washed away at this point.
[01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:13.227]  Those are irrelevant.
[01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:13.907]  Those are gone.
[01:36:14.347 --> 01:36:16.248]  None of that matters at this point.
[01:36:16.508 --> 01:36:18.729]  It's Trump or we lose this country.
[01:36:18.769 --> 01:36:25.651]  And if they want to kill Trump, just like they want to kill America, that means we have to double down, triple down for our support of Trump.
[01:36:25.691 --> 01:36:26.071]  No, I agree.
[01:36:26.191 --> 01:36:27.412]  Everything else is irrelevant.
[01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:30.010]  Mike, I want you to go back to ballistics.
[01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:31.751]  I know you're a Christian.
[01:36:32.352 --> 01:36:33.272]  I really respect you.
[01:36:33.292 --> 01:36:34.453]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:36:34.713 --> 01:36:36.775]  Will you say a prayer for Trump in America?
[01:36:36.795 --> 01:36:38.196]  Because we have to call on God right now.
[01:36:38.656 --> 01:36:39.577]  I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
[01:36:39.597 --> 01:36:42.379]  Will you say a prayer and then go back to ballistics and back to whatever?
[01:36:42.399 --> 01:36:43.219]  I'm going to let you take over.
[01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:56.629]  Dear God, our Lord in heaven, thank you for intervening today in just nudging Trump to turn his head to the right so that that bullet would only graze his ear.
[01:36:57.535 --> 01:37:05.721]  And send a message of life and liberty in blood to America that we are the blood of Christ.
[01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:08.143]  We are the living embodiment of Christ.
[01:37:08.443 --> 01:37:13.187]  And if he had not turned his head for that moment, that bullet would have taken him down.
[01:37:14.122 --> 01:37:15.543]  Only by the grace of God are we here.
[01:37:15.583 --> 01:37:16.604]  We must remember that.
[01:37:16.644 --> 01:37:18.806]  We must instill that in all of us.
[01:37:19.087 --> 01:37:20.268]  We must invoke that.
[01:37:20.908 --> 01:37:27.154]  Only by the grace of God do we exist as a nation, and it is only by the grace of God that we shall prevail in this election.
[01:37:27.434 --> 01:37:29.396]  This cannot be won by human hands.
[01:37:30.036 --> 01:37:35.922]  This cannot be won by strategy alone, or blogging alone, or videos alone.
[01:37:35.942 --> 01:37:40.346]  This can only be won by the grace of God, and He spoke to us today, and He told us that He is with us.
[01:37:41.602 --> 01:37:44.064]  And we praise you, Lord, for this protection.
[01:37:44.184 --> 01:37:48.206]  Thank you, Almighty God, for this country and for President Trump.
[01:37:49.307 --> 01:37:49.587]  Amen.
[01:37:52.029 --> 01:37:53.290]  It's epic, Mike.
[01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:54.210]  Keep going.
[01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:55.651]  Go back to your ballistics.
[01:37:55.671 --> 01:37:56.612]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[01:37:57.853 --> 01:38:08.579]  Well, the reason I did this ballistic analysis was so that no one from the left can say that this was faked because the audio forensics are imprinted forever, even in the Fox News broadcast.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.280]  Sorry, I'm just
[01:38:12.539 --> 01:38:14.881]  I'm a little bit moved here.
[01:38:17.103 --> 01:38:19.604]  Mike, this is so epic.
[01:38:19.725 --> 01:38:20.625]  God came through.
[01:38:20.665 --> 01:38:22.006]  They almost killed me.
[01:38:22.026 --> 01:38:22.787]  Can you imagine?
[01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:23.768]  Talk about this.
[01:38:23.848 --> 01:38:27.470]  What would happen if they killed me there?
[01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:33.075]  I don't know how much violence would have erupted across this country.
[01:38:33.495 --> 01:38:35.617]  I mean, it would have been a horrible situation.
[01:38:35.657 --> 01:38:37.398]  The fact that he was spared.
[01:38:37.418 --> 01:38:39.800]  Again, I think it's a message, Alex.
[01:38:41.534 --> 01:38:46.277]  Harrison and Kaiser, this is a message that we have to do more.
[01:38:46.317 --> 01:38:47.378]  We have to step up our game.
[01:38:48.218 --> 01:38:53.241]  As much as we've all sacrificed, and I know Alex, you've sacrificed more than most, it's still not enough.
[01:38:53.681 --> 01:38:54.861]  We have to up our game.
[01:38:54.962 --> 01:39:03.466]  We have to be determined to do everything to help Trump win this election, to have the election run its course peacefully, lawfully.
[01:39:03.966 --> 01:39:05.767]  We must stop the cheaters.
[01:39:05.787 --> 01:39:06.888]  We must stop the violence.
[01:39:08.194 --> 01:39:12.355]  So finish the ballistics, then give us your analysis.
[01:39:12.375 --> 01:39:14.856]  I'd like to ask you one question, Mike, if I may.
[01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:15.316]  Yes.
[01:39:15.496 --> 01:39:28.180]  So given that this was such an easy shot for somebody who's versed in shooting, are you implying that the shooter was not a professional, or are you just trying to emphasize the fact that it was a miracle that he moved his head?
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.260]  No, Trump was moving.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.140]  Trump was moving.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:31.301]  He was moving.
[01:39:31.521 --> 01:39:32.121]  Yeah.
[01:39:32.581 --> 01:39:33.561]  There's some videos.
[01:39:33.841 --> 01:39:35.622]  Even military snipers, yes.
[01:39:36.212 --> 01:39:40.617]  Well, there are some videos and photos that I just want to make the crew aware of and bring it in.
[01:39:40.637 --> 01:39:44.681]  There's a photo, actually, you can actually see the bullet as a streak flying past Trump.
[01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:47.024]  So, all claims of hoax should be put to bed immediately.
[01:39:47.044 --> 01:39:49.627]  You can literally see the bullet flying by.
[01:39:51.969 --> 01:39:52.449]  My God.
[01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:53.849]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:39:53.929 --> 01:40:06.472]  And then there's other videos they've slowed down where you can see Trump and you can see him move his head just the slightest bit and it was that little movement, that little twitch of the muscle that changed the outcome of this event.
[01:40:06.832 --> 01:40:10.172]  And I think if the crew can pull that in, we'll watch that.
[01:40:10.192 --> 01:40:11.433]  Yeah, I used to be a big hunter.
[01:40:11.453 --> 01:40:12.213]  I used to be a big hunter.
[01:40:12.693 --> 01:40:14.173]  And I've shot deer at 800 yards.
[01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:17.934]  But sometimes you got a deer at 600 yards in the scope
[01:40:18.758 --> 01:40:19.778]  And they move.
[01:40:20.079 --> 01:40:21.079]  When you shoot, you miss them.
[01:40:21.439 --> 01:40:22.799]  Trump just moved the right time.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:30.462]  Well, I want to point out that as you know, I'm an experienced long-range target shooter myself.
[01:40:31.362 --> 01:40:32.823]  And at that range,
[01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:34.411]  But even the best shooter
[01:40:58.172 --> 01:41:03.854]  Even the best shooter, when you're on a rooftop, about to kill the president, that's a nervous thing, Mike, right?
[01:41:03.874 --> 01:41:08.496]  Like, we don't want to kill Trump, but you imagine, you got Trump in your sights, like, are you a little nervous doing that, Mike?
[01:41:09.456 --> 01:41:25.983]  Well, and apparently he climbed up on that roof, and that could have been physically taxing to do that, but I still believe, I believe God intervened here, and God is the reason why Trump turned his head, why he moved slightly, why this bullet was just off course, but enough on course
[01:41:26.823 --> 01:41:27.383]  I agree.
[01:41:27.523 --> 01:41:29.484]  I can shoot bullseye and I'm not the best shooter.
[01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:32.545]  I can shoot bullseye all day at 400 yards.
[01:41:32.565 --> 01:41:33.685]  You're saying an active gun.
[01:41:35.046 --> 01:41:35.486]  Absolutely.
[01:41:35.706 --> 01:41:40.467]  What I'm saying is that an accomplished shooter would not have missed at that range.
[01:41:40.487 --> 01:41:44.449]  That is not a difficult range for an accomplished shooter.
[01:41:44.489 --> 01:41:44.889]  Not at all.
[01:41:45.269 --> 01:41:47.790]  Your audience will confirm that, those who are, you know, former military.
[01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:48.690]  So let me ask you this, Mike.
[01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:49.510]  Let me ask you this.
[01:41:50.031 --> 01:41:50.651]  Let me ask you this.
[01:41:51.251 --> 01:41:53.412]  They're trying to deny it even happened now, which is pathetic.
[01:41:53.452 --> 01:41:54.072]  It's not going to work.
[01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:57.873]  What do you see coming next from the deep state now in this bloomer phase?
[01:42:00.235 --> 01:42:06.200]  Well, it's like I said earlier, I think they're going to move into creating a crisis that will cancel the election.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.063]  They have a lot up their sleeve to do that.
[01:42:09.303 --> 01:42:12.225]  Alex, as you know, they've got an EMP false flag.
[01:42:12.245 --> 01:42:14.547]  They've got a cyber attack false flag on the banking system.
[01:42:15.008 --> 01:42:16.769]  They can cause chaos in numerous ways.
[01:42:16.829 --> 01:42:19.372]  They can also do a nuclear false flag in Europe.
[01:42:20.793 --> 01:42:30.781]  Remember that they've just announced F-16s for Europe, and Medvedev has said that, you know, if those F-16s take off from air bases in places like Romania and Poland, then those become legitimate targets.
[01:42:31.161 --> 01:42:44.311]  But what if, after this, the deep state sets off a nuke in a military base in Romania and says Russia did it, invokes Article 5, and then now NATO countries launch a nuclear attack against Russia?
[01:42:44.351 --> 01:42:47.214]  Mike Adams, I don't think this is reactionary.
[01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:48.755]  Are fair mongering about you.
[01:42:48.815 --> 01:42:49.295]  It's dead on.
[01:42:49.635 --> 01:42:50.675]  Look at Drudge Report.
[01:42:51.996 --> 01:42:54.117]  They're like, pop, pop, pop.
[01:42:54.277 --> 01:42:55.698]  Then Trump rushed from rally.
[01:42:56.298 --> 01:42:56.958]  Much bleeding.
[01:42:57.058 --> 01:42:57.478]  Video.
[01:42:57.578 --> 01:42:58.619]  Interviews of witnesses.
[01:42:59.179 --> 01:42:59.939]  Secret Service.
[01:42:59.999 --> 01:43:00.700]  Blue shooters.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.060]  Head off.
[01:43:01.917 --> 01:43:05.419]  They won't even say it was an assassination attempt.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.601]  Imagine that level of gaslighting, Mike Adams.
[01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:09.282]  What does that say?
[01:43:09.302 --> 01:43:09.742]  Incredible.
[01:43:10.282 --> 01:43:10.683]  Incredible.
[01:43:10.963 --> 01:43:12.684]  No, they're living in an alternate reality.
[01:43:12.704 --> 01:43:14.565]  It's going to it's going to backfire against them.
[01:43:14.985 --> 01:43:20.449]  And don't forget that Joe Biden said in a fundraising call just a few days ago that it's time to put Trump in the bullseye.
[01:43:20.909 --> 01:43:21.109]  Right.
[01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:22.330]  So those are his words.
[01:43:22.890 --> 01:43:28.914]  And that could have been, you know, code for unleashing this kind of attack against Trump.
[01:43:28.954 --> 01:43:31.416]  Now, we don't we don't yet know anything about the shooter, do we?
[01:43:31.978 --> 01:43:32.823]  Has anything come out?
[01:43:33.004 --> 01:43:35.136]  We are getting some more information about the shooter.
[01:43:37.202 --> 01:43:37.602]  Go ahead Alex.
[01:43:37.622 --> 01:43:37.902]  Tell us.
[01:43:39.023 --> 01:43:39.723]  No, tell us.
[01:43:39.883 --> 01:43:42.243]  We're seeing pictures of the alleged shooter.
[01:43:42.263 --> 01:43:46.665]  I want to make sure that we're totally sure before we show anything, but there are pictures coming out.
[01:43:46.725 --> 01:43:49.945]  He appears to be a 20-something white guy.
[01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:52.566]  He's got an Antifa look about him.
[01:43:52.686 --> 01:43:54.547]  Sort of long, greasy brown hair.
[01:43:54.587 --> 01:43:56.707]  Yeah, mainstream media is saying he's Antifa.
[01:43:57.167 --> 01:43:59.728]  But when mainstream media gets it wrong, we cover it, they sue us.
[01:44:00.508 --> 01:44:02.889]  They're saying he's Antifa on Drudge Report, we don't know.
[01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:07.790]  Yeah, so I'm trying to be very careful with any coverage, making sure that we have it.
[01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:16.253]  I will say, DC Drano posted earlier today secret instructions given to news reporters telling them to play down Trump's assassination attempt.
[01:44:17.073 --> 01:44:17.633]  I saw that.
[01:44:17.833 --> 01:44:20.434]  We don't know if this is real or not, but it fits with all the headlines.
[01:44:20.534 --> 01:44:22.914]  It says things like, stick to facts, don't speculate.
[01:44:22.954 --> 01:44:23.755]  But they're doing it!
[01:44:23.875 --> 01:44:24.855]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:44:24.875 --> 01:44:25.855]  They're playing it down.
[01:44:26.215 --> 01:44:32.437]  Let me ask you, Harrison Smith, Chase Geyser, and then Mike Adams.
[01:44:33.703 --> 01:44:35.584]  How crazy is it they're playing this down?
[01:44:35.724 --> 01:44:37.145]  That is going to blow up even bigger in their face.
[01:44:38.226 --> 01:44:38.847]  Yeah, no.
[01:44:39.767 --> 01:44:46.071]  And look, you would have thought they'd learned their lesson with, you know, how they were humiliated with Joe Biden's debate performance and the lies they told exposed there.
[01:44:46.131 --> 01:44:51.815]  But here they are just blatantly warping reality and not calling it an assassination attempt.
[01:44:52.356 --> 01:44:58.320]  President Biden gave a two and a half minute press conference, never called it an assassination attempt, called it an incident.
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.783]  And then this is the way that the mainstream media is being told to report this.
[01:45:01.823 --> 01:45:04.485]  So, we saw on Drudge that they are now calling it an assassination attempt.
[01:45:04.565 --> 01:45:09.169]  I think that's because the authorities are now saying, officially, it was an assassination attempt.
[01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:14.754]  And that's one of the notes that was sent, was saying, don't call it an assassination unless authorities say it was.
[01:45:15.034 --> 01:45:20.679]  So now that the authorities are saying an assassination attempt, the media has permission to say what we all saw with our own eyes.
[01:45:20.719 --> 01:45:22.240]  It was, in fact, an assassination attempt.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:22.680]  They had to wait.
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.022]  They had to wait for the authorities to tell us that's what it was, I guess.
[01:45:27.344 --> 01:45:35.450]  Do we have a medical announcement yet from Team Trump about his actual condition?
[01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:41.754]  I saw that he posted on Truth Social, and he was asking for prayers for the actual victims of the bystanders.
[01:45:41.914 --> 01:45:43.235]  I believe at least one was killed.
[01:45:43.335 --> 01:45:44.376]  Don Jr.
[01:45:44.436 --> 01:45:47.217]  said that he spoke to him that he was okay, health-wise.
[01:45:48.058 --> 01:45:48.678]  Okay, okay.
[01:45:48.779 --> 01:45:50.119]  Yeah, we saw the video.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:53.862]  It literally cut the top of his—it blew the top of his ear off.
[01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:58.113]  So, you know, ears bleed a lot, right?
[01:45:58.133 --> 01:45:59.574]  There's a lot of blood vessels in your ears.
[01:45:59.714 --> 01:46:01.696]  So that could explain all that blood.
[01:46:02.096 --> 01:46:08.622]  But I got to tell you, after this, Trump is going to have the most amazing ear scar that will even impress all the UFC fighters.
[01:46:09.123 --> 01:46:14.828]  At this point, I mean, oh my gosh, what a mark of resilience and determination.
[01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:17.450]  It's a badge of honor.
[01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:18.611]  This is a badge of honor.
[01:46:23.738 --> 01:46:24.218]  Absolutely.
[01:46:24.859 --> 01:46:36.706]  But what we have to do, Alex, number one, we need to reinforce to all of our audiences, do not initiate any form of reactionary violence or anything of that kind.
[01:46:37.207 --> 01:46:38.187]  Remain calm.
[01:46:38.327 --> 01:46:39.448]  Use your words, right?
[01:46:39.728 --> 01:46:40.209]  Use your words.
[01:46:40.249 --> 01:46:41.409]  Don't contribute to violence.
[01:46:41.449 --> 01:46:43.291]  Too much violence was already attempted to be inflicted.
[01:46:43.331 --> 01:46:45.192]  That was my next question.
[01:46:45.212 --> 01:46:45.812]  Mike, elaborate on that.
[01:46:45.952 --> 01:46:47.013]  Mike, let me interrupt you.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.080]  I agree.
[01:46:48.981 --> 01:46:53.744]  I always said if they kill Trump or try to kill Trump, they'll stage events and say, we did it.
[01:46:53.804 --> 01:46:55.164]  How do we stop a false flagger?
[01:46:55.545 --> 01:46:57.766]  What do you think they do to try to get us to claim we're violent?
[01:46:59.387 --> 01:47:10.853]  I think the next play by the FBI is to roll out Patriot Front and try to whip up some violence somewhere with their FBI agents and then blame it on Trump supporters and saying that they're really, really mad because of the assassination attempt.
[01:47:10.893 --> 01:47:11.594]  That's their next play.
[01:47:12.318 --> 01:47:17.802]  You know, I'll say they're already sort of seeding the ground for that, uh, because you have some people responding to this.
[01:47:18.002 --> 01:47:18.642]  Uh, J.D.
[01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:23.245]  Vance responded to the shooting saying, you know, this is leftist, stochastic terror.
[01:47:23.285 --> 01:47:26.648]  This is what, you know, this type of language they've been saying does.
[01:47:26.768 --> 01:47:30.770]  And, you know, the responses to him are people saying, well, this is a very irresponsible thing to say.
[01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:38.175]  So they're almost framing the backlash to the, you know, leftist violent rhetoric, which is now, you know, come to fruition in an attempted assassination.
[01:47:38.536 --> 01:47:40.517]  But if you point that out, you're the dangerous one.
[01:47:42.638 --> 01:47:43.119]  Exactly.
[01:47:43.179 --> 01:47:46.302]  Yeah, it's dangerous to start throwing blame around like that.
[01:47:46.342 --> 01:47:53.128]  So, you know, we want to be responsible here and not go throwing blame around and calling the leftists, you know, bad for saying that... Well, let me ask Mike this.
[01:47:53.148 --> 01:47:54.129]  Let me ask Mike this.
[01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:58.853]  Let me ask Mike Adams this, and then Harrison Smith, and then Chase Geyser.
[01:47:58.873 --> 01:47:59.994]  Then I'm going to let you guys continue.
[01:48:00.014 --> 01:48:01.556]  I'm going to go do another job and come right back.
[01:48:02.276 --> 01:48:04.699]  But this blew up the deep state's face.
[01:48:04.839 --> 01:48:05.599]  I was there behind it.
[01:48:05.659 --> 01:48:06.060]  It failed.
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:12.401]  What are they going to do next now that this failed, because they're so desperate?
[01:48:12.441 --> 01:48:12.881]  Mike Adams?
[01:48:15.702 --> 01:48:19.583]  Well, number one, again, they're going to try to run some kind of false flag operation.
[01:48:19.803 --> 01:48:32.406]  Secondly, remember that the Democrat donations to Biden have largely halted, so at least $90 million is locked up right now because the big billionaire donors don't want Biden to be in the race.
[01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:47.749]  Funding for Trump will now substantially increase, not only on the back of Elon Musk making a significant donation to a PAC that supports Trump, but there will be a sympathy donation wave that will come in now that will absolutely blow away the Democrats.
[01:48:51.129 --> 01:48:54.290]  I don't want to frame it in this way, but just cause and effect.
[01:48:54.891 --> 01:49:00.973]  The sympathy outpouring of this is going to result in hundreds of millions of dollars going into Trump's coffers.
[01:49:01.814 --> 01:49:04.955]  And not that anyone would want Trump to ever be subjected to a risk like that.
[01:49:04.995 --> 01:49:06.316]  I mean, the man nearly died today.
[01:49:06.796 --> 01:49:13.739]  But in the aftermath of it, he's going to emerge more resilient, stronger, more well-funded and more determined.
[01:49:13.819 --> 01:49:17.421]  And Alex, last thing I would like to add here is, I hinted at this earlier.
[01:49:18.121 --> 01:49:19.383]  This will change Trump.
[01:49:19.543 --> 01:49:22.828]  This will change his determination from here forward.
[01:49:23.208 --> 01:49:24.530]  This changes a person.
[01:49:24.610 --> 01:49:29.717]  If you almost die from a gunshot that whizzes by your head and punctures your ear,
[01:49:30.828 --> 01:49:33.909]  You start to think differently about your life and the world and your legacy.
[01:49:34.289 --> 01:49:37.250]  So, in a way, this just empowered Trump.
[01:49:37.731 --> 01:49:39.611]  This shooter tried to destroy Trump.
[01:49:40.191 --> 01:49:43.633]  What he actually did, he just doubled Trump's internal powers.
[01:49:43.693 --> 01:49:45.273]  Yeah, he woke a sleeping giant.
[01:49:45.313 --> 01:49:46.934]  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, hold on, hold on.
[01:49:47.454 --> 01:49:50.415]  I totally agree, Mike, but then they're going to double down.
[01:49:50.435 --> 01:49:51.355]  They're even more desperate.
[01:49:51.396 --> 01:49:52.536]  So what does the Deep State do now?
[01:49:54.575 --> 01:49:56.016]  All the things that we've been talking about.
[01:49:56.316 --> 01:49:57.917]  We're going to try everything.
[01:49:58.158 --> 01:49:58.798]  Let me say this, Alex.
[01:49:58.978 --> 01:50:04.062]  This is kind of bizarre, but President Biden gave a speech from Rehoboth, Delaware.
[01:50:04.102 --> 01:50:04.922]  He's on vacation.
[01:50:05.623 --> 01:50:09.245]  Just a minute ago, it's been reported he is now returning to the White House.
[01:50:09.885 --> 01:50:17.951]  So, I don't know what that tells you about this situation, but Biden is now returning to the White House following this event, and apparently because of this event.
[01:50:17.971 --> 01:50:22.754]  Well, I'm going to say this as Mike Adams leaves, and I'm going to be listening to you guys, Harrison.
[01:50:24.591 --> 01:50:25.652]  Their game plan is still the same.
[01:50:25.672 --> 01:50:29.735]  They've always had five or six backup plans of increasing severity.
[01:50:52.748 --> 01:50:56.410]  And, you know, we've mentioned some of them here on this show, but they're going to get more desperate.
[01:50:56.570 --> 01:51:01.854]  And Alex, I think they're going to make mistakes at this point.
[01:51:02.134 --> 01:51:06.336]  See, look, Obama was a master of running operations.
[01:51:06.957 --> 01:51:11.480]  Things that happened under Obama were masterfully crafted.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.522]  You know, even though I completely disagree with Obama, he was a very smart individual.
[01:51:16.103 --> 01:51:18.264]  Under Biden, it's panic city.
[01:51:18.784 --> 01:51:26.048]  So there's now much of an increased risk that they're going to try a false flag and screw it up and get caught and get exposed.
[01:51:26.349 --> 01:51:27.909]  And I think we should be watching for that.
[01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:30.471]  And also there are more cameras recording everything.
[01:51:30.491 --> 01:51:31.832]  No, I totally agree.
[01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:36.114]  So they could bring down the power grid and say Russians did it tomorrow.
[01:51:36.134 --> 01:51:37.235]  That's right.
[01:51:38.447 --> 01:51:38.787]  That's right.
[01:51:38.988 --> 01:51:46.215]  Or they could detonate an EMP weapon at altitude over North America and say North Korea did it, when it's actually the deep state itself doing it.
[01:51:46.235 --> 01:51:46.776]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:46.796 --> 01:51:49.879]  Because Mike, I'm like, my Spidey sense says we're in great danger.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.022]  Like everybody's celebrating, hey, they didn't kill him, oh, we're winning.
[01:51:53.323 --> 01:51:55.465]  I'm like, whoa, dude, we just upped the ante.
[01:51:55.785 --> 01:51:56.526]  Because we're winning.
[01:51:56.967 --> 01:51:57.848]  We're winning right now.
[01:51:58.168 --> 01:51:59.049]  They are in deep shit.
[01:51:59.795 --> 01:52:08.764]  So I guess the question is, if this was a deep state operation, or it was somehow, you know, they likely had other follow-up, like they expected Trump to be dead.
[01:52:08.824 --> 01:52:16.472]  At this moment, according to their plans, according to their, you know, framework, Trump should be dead, and they probably expected Trump supporters to be going insane right now.
[01:52:16.912 --> 01:52:17.993]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:52:18.033 --> 01:52:22.057]  That's a great question to Mike and Harrison and to Chase.
[01:52:22.638 --> 01:52:23.799]  If they killed Trump today,
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.661]  Two minutes on this, Mike, and I gotta go.
[01:52:25.681 --> 01:52:26.581]  I don't want the crew to do this.
[01:52:27.222 --> 01:52:29.063]  If they killed Trump today, how would they spend that?
[01:52:29.103 --> 01:52:32.926]  Like, he's dead, shot in the head, what would they say?
[01:52:32.986 --> 01:52:40.891]  Well, they would say it was because of the extremism pushed by conservatives, that the conservatives created an environment, and they would blame it on conservatives.
[01:52:41.091 --> 01:52:42.752]  But I want to say one other thing.
[01:52:43.072 --> 01:52:48.956]  Did you see how fast Trump ducked when he took a shot, and he realized he'd taken a shot?
[01:52:49.256 --> 01:52:49.757]  He ducked.
[01:52:50.197 --> 01:52:51.098]  Now, Joe Biden
[01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:54.900]  Yeah, when Trump got hit, instantly he dropped.
[01:52:55.121 --> 01:52:59.103]  Yeah, when Trump got hit, instantly he dropped.
[01:53:14.995 --> 01:53:17.297]  You know, Joe Biden's talking about, oh, he's doing cognitive tests every day.
[01:53:17.317 --> 01:53:18.218]  You want a cognitive test?
[01:53:18.538 --> 01:53:22.501]  I mean, Trump just took the ultimate cognitive test, and he passed it with flying colors.
[01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:23.542]  Oh, it was so zen.
[01:53:23.742 --> 01:53:24.483]  It was so zen.
[01:53:24.543 --> 01:53:24.683]  I'm 50.
[01:53:24.823 --> 01:53:26.445]  If I got hit, I'd be like this.
[01:53:26.765 --> 01:53:28.486]  He hits, instantly drops.
[01:53:28.907 --> 01:53:31.249]  Like, he was like, and you see that face he made?
[01:53:31.329 --> 01:53:33.630]  It was like zen.
[01:53:33.651 --> 01:53:38.615]  He was like... Yep, that's training, and that's reaction speed, and that shows you his neurology is working.
[01:53:38.635 --> 01:53:39.455]  Incredible.
[01:53:41.468 --> 01:53:41.888]  Exactly.
[01:53:41.908 --> 01:53:44.429]  I'm not kissing Trump's ass, Mike, but you're right.
[01:53:44.449 --> 01:53:45.989]  He literally is hit in a millisecond drops.
[01:53:46.009 --> 01:53:47.490]  If I was hit, I'd be like, what is that?
[01:54:07.056 --> 01:54:17.220]  This is going to be shown to future Secret Service agents for decades to come about what a president or presidential candidate should do in the midst of a shooting.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:23.942]  And also his team reacted very rapidly, but there was a failure to not check the backside of the rooftops.
[01:54:24.162 --> 01:54:28.964]  Obviously, and you've all seen that video, that somebody was trying to warn the cops and the cops weren't doing anything.
[01:54:29.004 --> 01:54:30.225]  So there's going to be an investigation.
[01:54:30.245 --> 01:54:32.045]  So Mike, what do you make of that?
[01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:34.006]  Because the first thing you check is the rooftops.
[01:54:36.914 --> 01:54:39.196]  Well, it was the rooftops, you know, they were angled, right?
[01:54:39.256 --> 01:54:47.501]  So there was the backside of the rooftop that was not easily visible from from where the the barn roof sniper was.
[01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:49.122]  We have some very interesting footage here.
[01:54:49.142 --> 01:54:50.883]  So this is before the shot has been fired.
[01:54:50.903 --> 01:54:53.465]  There you can see Trump put his hand up, but you can see the sniper.
[01:54:53.785 --> 01:54:58.308]  And I believe the sniper on the roof in the background there is the sniper that took the guy out.
[01:54:58.869 --> 01:55:00.530]  But this video is going viral right now.
[01:55:00.570 --> 01:55:04.032]  They've already talking about launching investigations into Secret Service, a ton of different organizations.
[01:55:04.432 --> 01:55:06.394]  But, you know, we talk about reaction time.
[01:55:07.034 --> 01:55:19.221]  You know, some people are seeing this and they're saying, you know, people are seeing a sniper take out the other sniper, but what I'm seeing is a guy with a clear shot not taking a shot for several seconds until Trump is actually fired on.
[01:55:19.261 --> 01:55:21.722]  So there you see the guy with the sniper rifle aiming at something.
[01:55:22.083 --> 01:55:23.804]  Trump has not moved yet, right?
[01:55:24.464 --> 01:55:25.445]  So the first shot's about...
[01:55:26.545 --> 01:55:43.640]  Uh, there, and there he puts his hand up, and you can actually see the sniper rifle guy sort of flinch and jerk back before returning to his rifle, and I don't know if he's the guy that shot the, uh, shot the shooter, or if that was somebody else, but just fascinating camera angle there.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:43.740]  Yeah.
[01:55:48.244 --> 01:55:49.165]  Yeah, let's make no mistake.
[01:55:49.185 --> 01:55:50.305]  Let's not be naive, folks.
[01:55:50.345 --> 01:55:50.846]  This is a deep state.
[01:56:14.614 --> 01:56:16.276]  This is an attempted assassination.
[01:56:16.296 --> 01:56:18.278]  We can blame the Secret Service all day.
[01:56:18.298 --> 01:56:21.502]  This was a deep state attack.
[01:56:21.902 --> 01:56:24.225]  And that tells us the ballpark we're in right now.
[01:56:26.343 --> 01:56:26.803]  Absolutely.
[01:56:27.264 --> 01:56:28.704]  We all need to be vigilant.
[01:56:28.864 --> 01:56:31.085]  We need to maintain a profile of peace.
[01:56:31.186 --> 01:56:33.307]  Let's unpack that a little bit.
[01:56:33.487 --> 01:56:45.273]  Because when you say deep state attack to the left, they assume that it's got to be somebody who's officially a CIA agent or officially law enforcement or in some official military capacity, if it's the deep state.
[01:56:45.493 --> 01:56:51.416]  Can we talk a little bit about how the deep state can weaponize or manipulate civilians into this kind of activity?
[01:56:51.836 --> 01:56:55.918]  Because that's something that's very, very infrequently discussed, but
[01:56:56.338 --> 01:57:00.082]  Well, I mean, let's just be clear.
[01:57:00.382 --> 01:57:02.844]  Yeah, let's just be clear.
[01:57:04.646 --> 01:57:10.931]  I've had family that was, like, high-level CIA, running major operations, and they told me about the New World Order, and that was bad, so I don't know about it.
[01:57:12.032 --> 01:57:16.376]  But then 90% of who they use are cutouts that are recruited.
[01:57:16.536 --> 01:57:17.377]  Mike, you've studied this.
[01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:18.418]  Do you want to speak to that briefly?
[01:57:19.389 --> 01:57:23.070]  Well, look back to the Aurora, Colorado shooting, the Batman Theater shooter.
[01:57:23.791 --> 01:57:25.151]  Look at, you know, the MKUltra program.
[01:57:25.191 --> 01:57:27.192]  I mean, Alex, over the years, you've covered so many of these.
[01:57:27.252 --> 01:57:28.452]  You know exactly how it works.
[01:57:28.953 --> 01:57:33.454]  They'll take somebody, they'll drug them up, they'll brainwash them, they'll trigger them at a certain time.
[01:57:33.514 --> 01:57:36.155]  Now, we don't know exactly if that's what happened in this case.
[01:57:36.515 --> 01:57:43.698]  It could be just that the anti-Trump hatred of the corporate media is what amped up this person, and who knows what else may have triggered this.
[01:57:43.878 --> 01:57:44.959]  I mean, we just don't know yet.
[01:57:46.563 --> 01:57:47.604]  It could absolutely be.
[01:57:47.704 --> 01:57:56.227]  Look, Alex and Harrison and Chase, I think that the deep state has dozens of these people on, you know, in inventory.
[01:57:56.627 --> 01:57:56.907]  Okay.
[01:57:57.248 --> 01:57:57.868]  All drugged up.
[01:57:58.068 --> 01:57:59.749]  I don't think you're right.
[01:57:59.949 --> 01:58:00.829]  They've got them warm.
[01:58:00.989 --> 01:58:02.330]  Mike, Mike, they've got them warmed up.
[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.950]  They got them ready.
[01:58:04.230 --> 01:58:04.731]  Absolutely.
[01:58:05.151 --> 01:58:11.273]  And they just, they just put them at events, you know, shoot up this place, shoot up that place, whatever.
[01:58:11.353 --> 01:58:12.494]  And they'll roll these people out.
[01:58:15.442 --> 01:58:16.683]  I'm sorry, I was getting a little feedback there.
[01:58:16.703 --> 01:58:17.363]  Sorry about the delay.
[01:58:17.403 --> 01:58:19.425]  But yeah, they've got these people on inventory.
[01:58:19.665 --> 01:58:20.505]  No question about it.
[01:58:20.605 --> 01:58:21.866]  So we have to be vigilant.
[01:58:22.346 --> 01:58:24.107]  We have to double down on security.
[01:58:24.167 --> 01:58:25.608]  We have to also de-escalate.
[01:58:26.008 --> 01:58:28.770]  I mean, don't initiate violence from the pro-Trump side.
[01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:30.991]  And watch everybody.
[01:58:31.712 --> 01:58:34.894]  Just like that guy today was saying, we saw this guy crawling up on the roof with a rifle.
[01:58:35.254 --> 01:58:38.036]  He should have been screaming up and down, jumping up and down.
[01:58:38.536 --> 01:58:38.716]  Yeah.
[01:58:38.896 --> 01:58:41.357]  About that, was a guy crawling up on a roof with a rifle?
[01:58:41.657 --> 01:58:42.437]  What's going on here?
[01:58:42.477 --> 01:58:45.658]  Like, make some noise to bring attention to the shooters.
[01:58:46.878 --> 01:58:50.759]  And look, you keep bringing, you know, all of this back, and I think we may have lost Alex there.
[01:58:50.799 --> 01:58:55.681]  If the crew can update me, it looks like maybe his headphones ran out of battery or something.
[01:58:55.701 --> 01:58:58.462]  But we'll probably be rejoined by him shortly, I'm sure.
[01:58:58.522 --> 01:59:01.022]  He said he was going to take a break and go on a different show for a second.
[01:59:01.062 --> 01:59:03.443]  But, you know,
[01:59:05.504 --> 01:59:07.185]  Where do we go from here?
[01:59:07.245 --> 01:59:08.506]  And this is, so J.D.
[01:59:08.566 --> 01:59:14.451]  Vance, I want to talk about this because I think this is so sort of illustrative of how this is going to be dealt with in the media.
[01:59:14.511 --> 01:59:14.751]  J.D.
[01:59:14.791 --> 01:59:20.956]  Vance, right, a potential vice president candidate for Trump, says, today is not some isolated incident.
[01:59:21.316 --> 01:59:27.661]  The central premise of the Biden campaign is that Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist that must be stopped at all costs.
[01:59:28.081 --> 01:59:31.464]  This rhetoric led directly to Trump's attempted assassination.
[01:59:32.301 --> 01:59:34.643]  Which I think is perfectly reasonable and absolutely true.
[01:59:34.704 --> 01:59:42.832]  And then in response to that, Robbie Save, who's the senior editor at Reason, and he's the host of Rising the Hill.
[01:59:43.913 --> 01:59:46.176]  This strikes me as very irresponsible, he says.
[01:59:46.236 --> 01:59:47.257]  We must be careful here.
[01:59:47.417 --> 01:59:51.401]  Republicans often chide liberals for saying hateful rhetoric is causing real-world violence.
[01:59:51.761 --> 01:59:53.583]  Vance is doing that right now.
[01:59:54.659 --> 02:00:03.086]  So he's saying that Vance is calling for real-world violence because Vance is saying that the real-world violence we just saw is because of the left's rhetoric.
[02:00:03.866 --> 02:00:07.429]  And maybe this is just, you know, like watching a dog chase its own tail.
[02:00:07.449 --> 02:00:10.792]  But this is the way the media is going to spin this.
[02:00:10.852 --> 02:00:18.158]  That our reaction, saying this is the leftist's fault, this is the liberal's fault, this is because they're staccatic terrorism, constantly demonizing Trump.
[02:00:18.558 --> 02:00:20.080]  And I talk about, you know, with voting fraud.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:26.701]  Just trying to explain to people, look, in the minds of the leftists, in the minds of the liberals, they think they're stopping Hitler, okay?
[02:00:26.781 --> 02:00:29.062]  They think they're, like, preventing genocide.
[02:00:29.502 --> 02:00:33.703]  You don't think they're gonna sign somebody else's name if that's the cost for preventing genocide?
[02:00:33.963 --> 02:00:40.764]  They think they're engaged in ontological good, in survival, so everything is justified, nothing is off-limits.
[02:00:41.304 --> 02:00:45.025]  And when I was saying that you bring up, you know, the Ukraine and the war in Europe,
[02:00:45.925 --> 02:00:52.268]  Just take that as a symbol of what they're willing to do for their plans, right?
[02:00:52.288 --> 02:00:59.172]  The Ukraine war is all part of a New World Order plan to enslave humanity, and probably a million people have died because of it.
[02:00:59.492 --> 02:01:05.435]  So when you're talking about the Deep State going crazy or starting a civil war, understand that it's not speculation that that's how far they would go.
[02:01:06.315 --> 02:01:15.503]  As we speak, they are engaged in a war with a million people or half a million people or God knows how many hundreds of thousands of people dead to pursue their plan.
[02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:20.687]  So, mass murder is not off the table when it comes to our enemies.
[02:01:21.667 --> 02:01:25.389]  Well, Harrison, what was the magazine cover that just came out with Trump as Hitler on the cover?
[02:01:25.629 --> 02:01:28.590]  Right, and that was a, wasn't that a conservative magazine?
[02:01:28.611 --> 02:01:30.311]  That was National Review or something, wasn't it?
[02:01:30.511 --> 02:01:31.092]  Is that what that was?
[02:01:31.112 --> 02:01:31.892]  Yeah.
[02:01:32.232 --> 02:01:35.654]  I forgot which publisher it was, but yeah, they put Trump as Hitler on the cover.
[02:01:36.154 --> 02:01:51.102]  That is clearly a, it's, they're broadcasting a sign, a message to all those who are willing to risk their lives to try to take out Trump, who they believe in their twisted minds, they believe that that's Hitler.
[02:01:51.662 --> 02:01:52.382]  Just like you said.
[02:01:52.842 --> 02:01:59.064]  And also, by the way, you know, the corporate media taints every jury against Trump.
[02:01:59.344 --> 02:02:01.504]  They taint every jury against Alex Jones.
[02:02:01.944 --> 02:02:07.785]  They taint every jury because the juries are taught that Trump is bad, Orange Man bad, all of that as well.
[02:02:07.845 --> 02:02:11.426]  So we are living under a massive spell.
[02:02:12.526 --> 02:02:14.567]  The American people are spellbound under
[02:02:15.387 --> 02:02:26.215]  It's almost like a dark magic media, and its sorcery is twisting people's minds into contortions of violence and killing, and that definitely contributed to what we saw today.
[02:02:26.535 --> 02:02:34.281]  And one thing people, I don't think people understand is that they expect tyranny to look like a World War II movie.
[02:02:35.402 --> 02:02:40.726]  If tyranny, if the tyrannizers, if a despot isn't goose-stepping down Main Street, they don't seem to recognize it.
[02:02:41.106 --> 02:02:44.489]  And I try to emphasize this constantly on American Journal.
[02:02:45.569 --> 02:02:48.552]  Excuse me, the fact that the Nazis had show trials.
[02:02:49.092 --> 02:02:52.715]  The USSR, the Communists, they had show trials.
[02:02:52.735 --> 02:02:53.976]  North Korea had one for Otto Warmbier.
[02:02:54.316 --> 02:02:55.517]  They had, yes, exactly.
[02:02:55.537 --> 02:03:02.342]  So because people see this process as your point, so it was the New Republic was the one that dressed him up like Hitler.
[02:03:02.422 --> 02:03:04.904]  And is that... The crazy thing is, he looks like he's half Biden.
[02:03:05.565 --> 02:03:07.106]  I know, he almost looks like Biden.
[02:03:07.126 --> 02:03:07.907]  It's so crazy.
[02:03:07.987 --> 02:03:10.649]  But absolutely, they...
[02:03:13.197 --> 02:03:18.300]  They have been priming the American people for this for so long and asking them, what would you do to stop Hitler?
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:20.100]  I mean, it's Hitler, so you got to stop him.
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.542]  And there's no extremity to which they will not reach.
[02:03:24.302 --> 02:03:27.224]  Now, I want to bring up something else here that I think is relevant.
[02:03:27.504 --> 02:03:37.269]  And by the way, you know, I don't know where your schedule is here, but I can say within a few more minutes, but if they're willing to do this to take out Trump, ask yourself this question.
[02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:40.570]  What is the Democrat deep state willing to do to take out Biden?
[02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:41.651]  Right.
[02:03:42.145 --> 02:03:44.466]  Because there's a civil war inside the Democrat Party.
[02:03:45.887 --> 02:03:46.067]  Right.
[02:03:46.687 --> 02:03:59.792]  And there are elements now within the Democrat Party that believe, and probably rightly so, that if they don't win this race, that some of them, many of them perhaps, will face criminal indictments because so much will come out about their actual crimes.
[02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.673]  Crimes of treason and money laundering and so on.
[02:04:02.914 --> 02:04:05.475]  Do they value Joe Biden enough to
[02:04:07.324 --> 02:04:17.601]  To take to take the option off the table of their own again leftist Democrat deep state, you know doing something to eliminate Joe Biden so they can replace him.
[02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:19.925]  See, I think I think that these evil.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:31.464]  Democrat deep staters are willing to kill anybody, and this assassination attempt on Trump is just, I believe, it's going to be linked to that Democrat deep state sooner or later.
[02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.125]  And, you know, Seth Rich, right?
[02:04:33.405 --> 02:04:34.725]  You know, you can go back to Vince Foster.
[02:04:34.905 --> 02:04:36.206]  There's a long history of this.
[02:04:36.326 --> 02:04:41.308]  How many people have the Democrats killed, even of their own people, in order to silence them, right?
[02:04:41.548 --> 02:04:41.688]  Right.
[02:04:42.448 --> 02:04:46.349]  Because they knew too much, or they had the records, or they were about to leak things.
[02:04:46.969 --> 02:04:48.809]  You could even look at Andrew Breitbart.
[02:04:48.869 --> 02:04:49.529]  What did he have?
[02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:52.970]  He had a video that was going to destroy the Obama administration.
[02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:54.230]  Julian Assange.
[02:04:54.250 --> 02:04:58.931]  Julian Assange, they tried to take, I mean, you remember Hillary Clinton saying, why can't we drone strike this guy, right?
[02:04:58.971 --> 02:05:06.853]  So I just want to say that, that nobody is safe from the Democrat deep state, not even the Democrats themselves.
[02:05:07.796 --> 02:05:12.878]  You know, it almost seems like if they can do it legally, that would be great for them.
[02:05:13.158 --> 02:05:15.459]  But if that fails, then they'll just do it illegally.
[02:05:15.479 --> 02:05:22.282]  Because if you think about what they're trying to do to Trump through the court, they're trying to send him to prison for 130 years or whatever it is, right?
[02:05:22.502 --> 02:05:26.843]  If they were to give him the full sentence for the 34 felonies they charged him with.
[02:05:27.243 --> 02:05:35.887]  So, you know, shoot him in the head or go through the rigmarole of a fake trial and then a conviction and then send him to jail for 30 years.
[02:05:36.787 --> 02:05:38.248]  They're out to destroy Trump.
[02:05:38.268 --> 02:05:40.630]  They're out to destroy us.
[02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:44.153]  If they have to go through the process to do it legally, then they'll do that.
[02:05:44.233 --> 02:05:45.715]  But if that doesn't work, they'll shoot you in the head.
[02:05:45.735 --> 02:05:46.736]  The outcome is the same.
[02:05:46.796 --> 02:05:47.716]  It's total destruction.
[02:05:47.917 --> 02:05:48.897]  It's total heartlessness.
[02:05:49.078 --> 02:05:50.419]  It's a total lack of mercy.
[02:05:50.959 --> 02:05:52.060]  It's total devastation.
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:59.987]  So, you know, shooting Trump in the head is really just an expedited version of what they're doing to him in a variety of different venues elsewhere, right?
[02:06:01.294 --> 02:06:02.254]  Yep, yep, exactly.
[02:06:02.375 --> 02:06:04.436]  And remember, their goal is to destroy America.
[02:06:04.656 --> 02:06:07.457]  This really got ramped up under the Obama administration.
[02:06:08.217 --> 02:06:10.879]  And, of course, Obama, many people believe, is still running Biden today.
[02:06:11.259 --> 02:06:14.180]  So this is actually the complete destruction of the United States of America.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:16.401]  And let me add this.
[02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:24.205]  To those people who think that they're going to steal this election the same way they stole it in 2020, at 4 o'clock in the morning, running a bunch of ballots, no, they don't need to do that.
[02:06:24.665 --> 02:06:32.228]  They're going to steal it all during the voting by fabricating votes attributed to all the illegals that they've registered to vote.
[02:06:32.948 --> 02:06:34.689]  They don't even need the illegals to vote.
[02:06:34.889 --> 02:06:38.710]  All they need to do is use their names in the database and attribute votes to them.
[02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:42.951]  This is going to be stolen in real time, so it won't look like a sudden line leaping up.
[02:06:43.232 --> 02:06:48.333]  It's going to be like a gradual increase in the Biden vote, and it's going to look really slick.
[02:06:48.373 --> 02:06:49.934]  That's the way they're going to try to pull it off this time.
[02:06:50.234 --> 02:06:51.515]  Here's the question though, Mike.
[02:06:51.595 --> 02:06:53.777]  What if they do it the same as they did it last time?
[02:06:54.037 --> 02:06:55.539]  What if they do it exactly the same?
[02:06:55.579 --> 02:07:00.383]  What if they kick out all the observers and in the middle of the night there's that straight up spike?
[02:07:00.823 --> 02:07:05.368]  What's gonna- and the media comes out the next day and says it doesn't exist, this was the most fair election in history.
[02:07:05.768 --> 02:07:08.050]  I mean, why wouldn't they just do it again?
[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:10.132]  Why wouldn't they just cheat again knowing that
[02:07:10.792 --> 02:07:13.273]  Well, Harrison, I have an answer for you.
[02:07:13.313 --> 02:07:17.275]  Because there are far more MAGA Republicans in Congress today than there were four years ago, right?
[02:07:17.315 --> 02:07:18.816]  So, four years ago, you had Mike Pence.
[02:07:39.508 --> 02:07:42.331]  Mike Pence betrayed America, and he betrayed Trump.
[02:07:43.492 --> 02:07:50.779]  Today, you've got fighters in the House and some in the Senate as well, and they're not going to just roll over this time.
[02:07:51.159 --> 02:07:52.140]  There would be a lot of pushback.
[02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:54.302]  That's why I think they have to do it a different way this time.
[02:07:56.485 --> 02:08:00.006]  Well, they definitely lost their only chance to shoot Trump.
[02:08:00.046 --> 02:08:03.746]  I mean, that's something I think, I don't think they're going to get this opportunity again.
[02:08:03.846 --> 02:08:12.488]  I mean, whether this was a setup, whether this was Secret Service or the deep state or whatever, I don't think they're going to get another chance like this, at least before the election, right?
[02:08:12.508 --> 02:08:16.088]  I mean, if you're Secret Service, you're not taking any chances from now until election.
[02:08:16.128 --> 02:08:23.950]  You're locking out, you're looking at every roof, you're locking, I mean, I would assume they did that anyway, but I doubt this opportunity is going to arise again.
[02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.430]  What do you think?
[02:08:25.851 --> 02:08:31.537]  I think, and I want to be very careful with what I'm saying here, I pray for Joe Biden's safety, okay?
[02:08:31.717 --> 02:08:38.623]  I don't want anything bad to happen to Joe Biden, but I think the next most likely assassination attempt by the Democrat Deep State is Joe Biden.
[02:08:38.784 --> 02:08:40.966]  And they can blame it on a Trump supporter.
[02:08:41.006 --> 02:08:47.172]  And it neutralizes the benefit to Trump's campaign of the assassination attempt if the same thing happens to Joe Biden.
[02:08:48.655 --> 02:08:51.636]  And if they can blame it on a Trump supporter, they can even say, here's the narrative.
[02:08:51.876 --> 02:08:54.597]  Well, the Trump supporters got mad because Trump was almost assassinated.
[02:08:54.617 --> 02:08:59.319]  So then this Trump supporter, who's actually an MKUltra, you know, sheep-dip, brainwashed person.
[02:08:59.639 --> 02:09:10.923]  So this Trump supporter went out and killed Joe, and then the Democrats can remove Joe out of their way so they can, you know, put their person in, whoever that may be, and they can get the sympathy vote at the last minute while blaming Trump.
[02:09:11.504 --> 02:09:15.005]  I mean, that's probably their most strategic play at this point.
[02:09:16.178 --> 02:09:16.679]  Incredible.
[02:09:16.719 --> 02:09:17.800]  I think you're exactly right.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:23.124]  Just to give you some of the breaking news here, I've just been monitoring all of the latest.
[02:09:23.164 --> 02:09:26.567]  Trump campaign RNC says convention in Milwaukee will proceed.
[02:09:27.067 --> 02:09:28.469]  Trump looks forward to joining.
[02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:31.331]  So they're not canceling anything here.
[02:09:31.351 --> 02:09:35.294]  Biden is apparently returning to Washington from vacation where he
[02:09:36.255 --> 02:09:37.396]  Thanks for coming, folks.
[02:09:56.823 --> 02:10:03.026]  I've been thoroughly briefed by all the agencies in the federal government as to the situation, based on what we know now.
[02:10:04.087 --> 02:10:06.288]  I have tried to get a hold of Donald.
[02:10:06.908 --> 02:10:07.869]  He's with his doctors.
[02:10:09.370 --> 02:10:10.890]  Apparently, he's doing well.
[02:10:11.571 --> 02:10:16.673]  I plan on talking to them shortly, I hope, when I get back to the telephone.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:20.621]  There's no place in America for this kind of violence.
[02:10:20.761 --> 02:10:21.261]  It's sick.
[02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:22.501]  It's sick.
[02:10:23.241 --> 02:10:25.142]  It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country.
[02:10:25.642 --> 02:10:27.863]  We cannot allow for this to be happening.
[02:10:27.903 --> 02:10:29.603]  We cannot be like this.
[02:10:29.663 --> 02:10:31.024]  We cannot condone this.
[02:10:31.644 --> 02:10:44.848]  And so, I want to thank the Secret Service and all the agencies, including the state agencies, that have been engaged in making sure that people, and we have more detail to come relative to other people who may be injured in the audience.
[02:10:45.308 --> 02:10:46.609]  I don't have all that detail.
[02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:48.089]  We'll make that available to you.
[02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:56.113]  I may be able to come back a little later tonight, but we'll put out a statement if we don't, if I'm not able to, if it's not convenient for you all.
[02:10:56.533 --> 02:11:04.417]  But the bottom line is that the Trump rally was a rally that he should have been able to be conducted peacefully without any problem.
[02:11:04.977 --> 02:11:07.078]  But the idea, the idea
[02:11:07.802 --> 02:11:11.543]  That there's political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of.
[02:11:11.563 --> 02:11:12.764]  It's just not appropriate.
[02:11:13.564 --> 02:11:15.305]  Everybody, everybody must condemn it.
[02:11:15.865 --> 02:11:16.325]  Everybody.
[02:11:16.885 --> 02:11:22.447]  I'll keep you informed and if I am able to speak to Donald I'll let you know that as well.
[02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:27.002]  So far, it appears he's doing well, number one.
[02:11:27.543 --> 02:11:32.484]  Number two, that they're thoroughly investigating what happened to anyone else in the audience.
[02:11:32.504 --> 02:11:36.005]  We have some reports, but not final reports.
[02:11:36.986 --> 02:11:46.629]  Every agency in the federal government, and I'm going back to my phone to speak with the federal agencies that are being put together again to give me an updated briefing.
[02:11:46.689 --> 02:11:49.530]  If anything happened, they learned any more in the last couple hours.
[02:11:50.171 --> 02:11:55.172]  So thank you very much, and I hope I get to speak to him tonight, and I'll get back to you if I do.
[02:11:55.192 --> 02:11:55.532]  Okay?
[02:11:55.552 --> 02:11:57.933]  Mr. President, do you think this was an assassination attempt?
[02:12:00.094 --> 02:12:04.315]  I don't know enough to... I have an opinion, but I don't have any facts.
[02:12:04.435 --> 02:12:04.755]  Wow.
[02:12:04.835 --> 02:12:08.876]  So I want to make sure we have all the facts before I make any more comments.
[02:12:08.936 --> 02:12:09.256]  Thank you.
[02:12:09.516 --> 02:12:10.996]  Are you worried about safety?
[02:12:11.656 --> 02:12:13.297]  Was the security failing, Mr. President?
[02:12:15.223 --> 02:12:16.944]  Wouldn't even say it was an assassination.
[02:12:17.304 --> 02:12:32.031]  So there's Joe Biden, President of the United States, taking a brief time, you know, off of his typical schedule of calling half of America MAGA extremist domestic terrorists to say, hey, we need to bring the rhetoric down and, you know, violence isn't the answer.
[02:12:32.852 --> 02:12:35.533]  So just, just repulsive to me.
[02:12:36.293 --> 02:12:37.694]  But what else is he going to say?
[02:12:37.714 --> 02:12:41.256]  It was a very, it was very as expected statement.
[02:12:41.596 --> 02:12:42.476]  Mike Adams, your
[02:12:44.488 --> 02:12:45.768]  Feeling on what we just saw.
[02:12:46.748 --> 02:12:52.650]  Well, you know, interestingly, that that that's probably Joe Biden's best neurological performance in weeks.
[02:12:53.370 --> 02:12:57.091]  He actually sounded, you know, mostly with it there.
[02:12:57.151 --> 02:13:02.272]  So I'm glad he made that statement, but he wouldn't call it an assassination attempt when it clearly was.
[02:13:02.592 --> 02:13:12.434]  And then he claimed that this kind of political violence doesn't happen in America when he knows the Democrats and there's all kinds of people that have been killed because of what they knew or the documents they had.
[02:13:12.474 --> 02:13:13.554]  I mean, there are all kinds of
[02:13:14.054 --> 02:13:14.635]  We're good to go.
[02:13:34.955 --> 02:13:35.355]  Drones.
[02:13:35.875 --> 02:13:45.759]  Drones are going to be the next most likely assassination vehicle, because a small explosive charge on an FPS drone can be very quickly flown into the area.
[02:13:45.819 --> 02:13:52.262]  Now, I know that, you know, there are FAA restrictions, usually around presidential events or campaign events.
[02:13:52.342 --> 02:13:56.944]  I don't know if there was a no-tam associated with this event, where drones would not be allowed to fly.
[02:13:57.664 --> 02:13:59.245]  That would be interesting if somebody would look at that.
[02:13:59.685 --> 02:14:02.186]  But I fear that drones could be used
[02:14:03.214 --> 02:14:04.735]  I don't know.
[02:14:18.902 --> 02:14:20.143]  Have you heard anything about that threat?
[02:14:20.423 --> 02:14:20.824]  I don't.
[02:14:20.884 --> 02:14:31.673]  Other than a no-fly zone, I would have to think that they... Even if it was against the rules to fly a drone, do they actually have the tools or mechanisms in place to do something about it if someone flies one in anyway?
[02:14:31.813 --> 02:14:34.295]  I don't know about, like, homemade drones.
[02:14:34.535 --> 02:14:35.656]  If it's anything, you know...
[02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:37.131]  I don't know.
[02:14:54.574 --> 02:14:55.615]  Extremely subtle.
[02:14:55.735 --> 02:15:02.779]  If they want to take somebody out and have everyone think it's cancer, heart attack guns, cancer guns, radiation.
[02:15:02.799 --> 02:15:05.661]  I mean, there's a million billion different ways they can take somebody out.
[02:15:05.941 --> 02:15:10.364]  So if they want to take somebody out in public on live TV, there's a reason, right?
[02:15:10.404 --> 02:15:12.225]  They want that because they want the reaction.
[02:15:12.545 --> 02:15:17.208]  If they just want to get rid of somebody, they could do it and nobody would even know a murder had taken place.
[02:15:17.268 --> 02:15:22.211]  So if they're going to use something like a drone or, you know, being shot at a public event,
[02:15:22.931 --> 02:15:30.816]  Yes, and Harrison, if the Deep State takes out Trump, they need to make sure it can be blamed on a lone gunman type of scenario so that the Deep State doesn't take the blame.
[02:15:42.079 --> 02:15:42.279]  Yeah.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:43.561]  Or an anti-Semite.
[02:15:43.981 --> 02:15:44.141]  Yeah.
[02:15:44.222 --> 02:15:47.505]  They might say, oh, this person was anti-Semitic because Trump was... Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:47.726 --> 02:15:48.326]  I see what you're saying.
[02:15:48.367 --> 02:15:48.507]  Right.
[02:15:49.308 --> 02:15:50.289]  They want to have a scapegoat.
[02:15:50.849 --> 02:15:56.877]  So, and hence the whole MKUltra type of program, which is very much active today, as Alex was saying earlier.
[02:15:57.497 --> 02:15:58.058]  So, look.
[02:15:59.648 --> 02:16:01.509]  I'm going to keep monitoring this, as I know you guys are.
[02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:09.195]  I just want to encourage the viewers, you know, support InfoWars at drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:19.842]  InfoWars needs funding in order to continue to function, and it's an outstanding line of nutritional supplements that can help protect and enhance your health.
[02:16:20.462 --> 02:16:22.044]  And I say that as the health ranger.
[02:16:22.124 --> 02:16:24.448]  So check it out, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:16:24.828 --> 02:16:26.931]  And thank you guys for having me here today or this evening.
[02:16:27.552 --> 02:16:31.397]  It's been a pleasure, but I'm just, I thank God Trump is okay.
[02:16:31.757 --> 02:16:32.098]  Thank God.
[02:16:32.858 --> 02:16:33.758]  Thank God, indeed.
[02:16:33.818 --> 02:16:37.299]  Thank you so much, Mike Adams, for joining us at Health Ranger.
[02:16:37.419 --> 02:16:41.200]  And, of course, your name was one of the first that popped into my mind when I knew we were going live.
[02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:42.640]  And I was thinking, who can we get on?
[02:16:43.501 --> 02:16:45.081]  Health Ranger was at the top of the list.
[02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:46.221]  So thank you so much for joining us.
[02:16:46.241 --> 02:16:47.902]  Thank you for your analysis.
[02:16:48.142 --> 02:16:52.823]  And please let us know if you find anything else of note, as I know you're doing the audio breakdown.
[02:16:53.443 --> 02:16:58.985]  And I'm sure there's going to be a lot of interesting information coming out about this shooting in the future.
[02:16:59.005 --> 02:17:00.065]  Thank you, Mike Adams, for being with us.
[02:17:00.785 --> 02:17:01.186]  Thank you both.
[02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:01.907]  I'll keep digging.
[02:17:01.927 --> 02:17:02.529]  I know you will, too.
[02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:03.190]  Have a great evening.
[02:17:03.811 --> 02:17:04.272]  Absolutely.
[02:17:04.312 --> 02:17:04.933]  You as well.
[02:17:05.154 --> 02:17:11.006]  And look, it's amazing that we're not
[02:17:12.774 --> 02:17:16.275]  Here mourning the death of President Trump, and thank God we aren't.
[02:17:16.616 --> 02:17:33.082]  And we're in this weird situation where we're half relieved and half worried about what comes next, and wondering if this was just the outcome of the staccatic terror of the left, or whether this was something even more, you know, deeply planned out and orchestrated.
[02:17:34.183 --> 02:17:36.404]  I'll tell you, thank God, InfoWars is here on the air.
[02:17:36.444 --> 02:17:42.226]  Thank God you go to InfoWarsStore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com and support us and keep us on the air.
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:47.963]  It feels crazy to actually be sitting here at this incredible moment in history.
[02:17:49.304 --> 02:17:53.728]  The Save InfoWars Mega Sale is on, and you guys have saved us before.
[02:17:53.768 --> 02:17:58.511]  We've had sales in the past that were like the Save InfoWars sale, and you saved InfoWars.
[02:17:58.611 --> 02:17:59.012]  It worked.
[02:17:59.212 --> 02:18:02.555]  You came through, and we actually survived the attacks.
[02:18:02.615 --> 02:18:05.397]  We're still... We're still alive.
[02:18:05.417 --> 02:18:08.199]  I'm sure the way I think about it is almost like we're in a coma.
[02:18:08.959 --> 02:18:10.801]  Where it's like, it's not a guarantee that we're gonna wake up.
[02:18:11.491 --> 02:18:11.991]  But we could.
[02:18:12.291 --> 02:18:12.952]  We could wake up.
[02:18:12.992 --> 02:18:17.454]  We could go on to live a very extensive life after we get over this.
[02:18:18.094 --> 02:18:22.156]  But as of now, we're still trying to wake up at this point.
[02:18:22.196 --> 02:18:23.737]  Yeah, we've been dodging bullets a long time.
[02:18:23.977 --> 02:18:25.257]  Yeah.
[02:18:25.577 --> 02:18:26.438]  I mean, it's wild.
[02:18:26.558 --> 02:18:27.098]  It is wild.
[02:18:27.138 --> 02:18:40.144]  But if we make it through this chunk of time, if we actually get over this hump and get through this trial, metaphorical trial, and literal trial, then, you know,
[02:18:41.172 --> 02:18:41.913]  We're good.
[02:18:41.973 --> 02:18:42.553]  Like, we're good.
[02:18:42.613 --> 02:18:43.234]  We will go.
[02:18:43.254 --> 02:18:44.475]  We will continue to fight.
[02:18:44.515 --> 02:18:46.877]  We will continue to do everything that we've always done.
[02:18:46.957 --> 02:18:47.597]  Exposing this.
[02:18:47.837 --> 02:18:48.638]  Predicting this.
[02:18:49.419 --> 02:18:55.784]  Helping to hopefully be a steady hand and guiding light in these increasingly turbulent times.
[02:18:57.657 --> 02:19:01.159]  But if you don't go to Infowarsstore.com, then they don't even have to sue us.
[02:19:01.279 --> 02:19:02.479]  They don't even have to shut us down.
[02:19:02.519 --> 02:19:04.881]  They don't have to send the sheriffs to lock the doors.
[02:19:05.241 --> 02:19:05.841]  We'll just go away.
[02:19:06.221 --> 02:19:07.482]  We'll just go away without your support.
[02:19:07.502 --> 02:19:09.283]  So please, please do support us.
[02:19:10.083 --> 02:19:14.726]  And I just want to say, Dr. Jones Naturals has this bubblegum toothpaste.
[02:19:15.666 --> 02:19:30.457]  I have a three-year-old who I it's very hard to get him to do anything really but brushing his teeth is almost impossible because he hated the toothpaste that we had because we had to get the non-fluoride we had to we couldn't we couldn't get the brand name stuff because that's poison so the stuff we had he didn't like it.
[02:19:30.797 --> 02:19:33.659]  I got the Dr. Jones Naturals bubble gum stuff
[02:19:34.259 --> 02:19:36.740]  And now I'm always like, now don't swallow the toothpaste.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.121]  And he's just like, he just like swallows it.
[02:19:39.161 --> 02:19:40.062]  He just loves this stuff.
[02:19:40.122 --> 02:19:41.562]  So it's, it tastes great.
[02:19:41.622 --> 02:19:42.223]  It's amazing.
[02:19:42.363 --> 02:19:43.443]  There's just so many products.
[02:19:43.603 --> 02:19:47.265]  And the reason I talk about toothpaste is because people think, well, I don't take supplements.
[02:19:47.325 --> 02:19:48.145]  I don't take vitamins.
[02:19:48.185 --> 02:19:49.086]  I don't want to get involved.
[02:19:49.386 --> 02:19:51.347]  I don't want to worry about, but you brush your teeth, right?
[02:19:51.367 --> 02:19:52.687]  I mean, you, you buy toothpaste.
[02:19:52.787 --> 02:19:56.109]  I hope, I hope that everybody listening to me buys toothpaste.
[02:19:56.769 --> 02:20:02.952]  And if you do just buy it from Dr. Jones Naturals instead of, you know, the pharmacy or the corner store, the grocery store.
[02:20:03.965 --> 02:20:25.953]  And like we'll stay on air and that'll be it and we'll never have to ask for money ever again if that if everybody listening to my voice just just made that one product switch just that one product that you use every day if you just bought it from us rather than them we'd never have to plug again and the the bamboo charcoal toothbrush pack is really good as well because you know with all the microplastics everywhere
[02:20:26.593 --> 02:20:30.054]  You don't want to be rubbing microplastics into your gums every day.
[02:20:30.114 --> 02:20:33.395]  Gums are some of the, it's one of the easiest ways for things to get into your bloodstream.
[02:20:33.675 --> 02:20:42.277]  Microplastics, nanoplastics can come off the toothbrush and off the bristles, but not if you've got Dr. Jones Natural's bamboo toothbrush, which my kids use as well.
[02:20:42.337 --> 02:20:51.060]  So, if you have kids, you've got to get the oral care stuff over Dr. Jones Natural's, and that's just a personal anecdote.
[02:20:52.532 --> 02:20:58.138]  Before we return to the breaking news of Donald Trump surviving an assassination attempt.
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:01.962]  I'm still just monitoring, waiting for any updates.
[02:21:02.903 --> 02:21:06.046]  Let's take this opportunity to run some Alex Jones Was Right videos.
[02:21:06.447 --> 02:21:08.809]  Very good, we have a lot of videos to show actually.
[02:21:08.829 --> 02:21:23.323]  I think that we've done our couple of hours of being somber about the moment, not relishing in the Alex Jones Was Right aspect of this, but now that we've given our respects to everyone and expressed our genuine concern and prayed to God, literally on air, all of us,
[02:21:23.863 --> 02:21:26.625]  Let's show some of the clips of Alex Jones being right about this.
[02:21:26.645 --> 02:21:30.167]  Do you guys have... Let's show the one of him with Posobiec in Detroit.
[02:21:30.207 --> 02:21:33.668]  This was... Yeah, just running back to back.
[02:21:37.591 --> 02:21:41.553]  You look at the trajectory of this, how they're escalating on Trump, whether you love him or hate him.
[02:21:41.813 --> 02:21:43.254]  He's now a populist icon.
[02:21:44.314 --> 02:21:45.295]  He's now the underdog.
[02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:47.412]  The globalists are coming after him.
[02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.293]  They're coming after our right to vote for who we want.
[02:21:49.613 --> 02:21:52.775]  He gets 60% against all... Which is the fundamental right in a democracy.
[02:21:53.556 --> 02:21:54.216]  The people rule.
[02:21:54.376 --> 02:21:56.018]  I can vote for whomever I want.
[02:21:56.078 --> 02:21:58.819]  And if you don't like that person, that's immaterial, right?
[02:21:58.879 --> 02:21:59.220]  Absolutely.
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:02.001]  And he's been indicted for saying they're stealing elections.
[02:22:02.282 --> 02:22:04.183]  They're stealing it trying... Oh, I'm aware.
[02:22:04.823 --> 02:22:05.163]  Absolutely.
[02:22:05.223 --> 02:22:06.304]  And they're indictments of him!
[02:22:06.324 --> 02:22:08.025]  Is election theft, but yes.
[02:22:10.310 --> 02:22:11.551]  He doesn't want to think about it.
[02:22:34.795 --> 02:22:35.235]  Confident.
[02:22:35.736 --> 02:22:41.200]  You know, the deep state does kill people, and that's their only next move because this is failing.
[02:22:42.341 --> 02:22:43.923]  And I think they're going to kill Biden, too.
[02:22:43.983 --> 02:22:54.392]  I think they're going to try to—what you said in a speech, again, before the last one I talked about like a month ago, you said, I don't see Biden and Trump being the candidates.
[02:22:54.552 --> 02:22:59.696]  You see the system, the media going after Biden, and he deserves it, but they were covering it up until now.
[02:23:00.076 --> 02:23:01.217]  Now they're covering the laptop.
[02:23:01.257 --> 02:23:02.578]  Now they're covering attacking the dog.
[02:23:02.618 --> 02:23:03.259]  Now they're covering
[02:23:03.643 --> 02:23:07.365]  You know, all of his senility, all the corruption, the Chinese spies.
[02:23:07.385 --> 02:23:08.386]  Attacking a dog?
[02:23:08.426 --> 02:23:09.387]  What a pig he is.
[02:23:10.227 --> 02:23:14.150]  Alex, I have to say, I have to say, I have to ask you, and I'm going to interview you for a minute.
[02:23:15.090 --> 02:23:21.314]  Alex, what do you think they'll do to President Trump between now and election day?
[02:23:21.935 --> 02:23:22.815]  You're eating my mind.
[02:23:23.276 --> 02:23:23.996]  What will they do to him?
[02:23:24.737 --> 02:23:29.920]  God literally gave us Donald Trump, imperfect as most men or women that God raises up in history.
[02:23:30.518 --> 02:23:32.618]  But he is a man of steel.
[02:23:32.999 --> 02:23:35.139]  He is a man who has ice water in his veins.
[02:23:35.539 --> 02:23:38.080]  He is a man who gets stronger under attack.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:44.361]  And so they have already put him through hell with all these show trials and rigged courts, civil and criminal.
[02:23:44.741 --> 02:23:47.302]  And they are going to try to assassinate President Trump.
[02:23:47.662 --> 02:23:49.082]  Make no mistake about that.
[02:23:49.382 --> 02:23:51.862]  They are going to try to pull out all the stops.
[02:23:52.083 --> 02:23:56.023]  And so we've got to pray for President Trump many times a day.
[02:23:57.764 --> 02:23:58.824]  And we've got to bust
[02:24:00.017 --> 02:24:18.665]  We've got to bust our rear ends to get out there in America because the people are waking up and they're ready to become fully awake and let them know that the WF and the UN and Bill Gates have said they're bringing new lockdowns, more forced injections, they're cutting off the farms, they're cutting off the energy.
[02:24:19.398 --> 02:24:25.121]  And if you think the economy in free fall right now is bad, it is going to be ten times worse.
[02:24:25.181 --> 02:24:26.741]  So this is existential.
[02:24:27.121 --> 02:24:33.164]  We are at war with the globalists and we must now recognize that this is a war.
[02:24:33.404 --> 02:24:35.385]  This is just as important as 1776 and the context of
[02:24:37.506 --> 02:24:39.188]  Are they going to succeed to prevent him from running?
[02:25:01.471 --> 02:25:04.534]  I mean, they're succeeding in a civil war right now in Russia.
[02:25:04.594 --> 02:25:10.739]  I mean, yeah, the global's hijacked the most powerful country in the world with all our ingenuity and all our money and all our power, and the world's in deep trouble.
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.042]  And again, it's not like I'm saying China or Russia are good either.
[02:25:14.102 --> 02:25:16.044]  It's just a monstrous situation.
[02:25:16.084 --> 02:25:23.351]  And if people don't get serious and get out of their comfort zones, yeah, I think they'll, I mean, I think they're going to demonize him and dot him and dot him and dot him and dot him.
[02:25:23.811 --> 02:25:25.853]  And then I think they'll blow his airplane up.
[02:25:26.153 --> 02:25:29.098]  I really, at a gut level, believe they're going to kill Trump.
[02:25:29.118 --> 02:25:29.859]  Who's this?
[02:25:29.879 --> 02:25:30.019]  Trump?
[02:25:30.039 --> 02:25:32.162]  I mean, I believe the deep state establishment will murder him.
[02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:34.946]  I mean, I believe he's going to steadfast go through all this.
[02:25:35.587 --> 02:25:35.948]  He'll be...
[02:25:36.892 --> 02:25:39.074]  He'll be 30 points ahead in the primaries.
[02:25:39.154 --> 02:25:40.035]  Nothing's going to stop him.
[02:25:40.515 --> 02:25:44.499]  And then they just, uh, you know, he dies of a heart attacker because they poisoned him or they blow his airplane up.
[02:25:44.899 --> 02:25:48.442]  And I think, and Trump, by the way, has talked to Roger and others and said, I'm ready to die.
[02:25:48.482 --> 02:25:48.842]  I'm committed.
[02:25:48.882 --> 02:25:49.383]  I'm going all the way.
[02:25:49.443 --> 02:25:53.747]  So you think, you think if they, if they, you know, you're saying they're going to do that, they would have already done it.
[02:25:54.047 --> 02:25:55.308]  Like, why haven't they already done it?
[02:25:55.388 --> 02:25:59.792]  Because that turns him into a martyr and they, and they'd rather assassinate the person.
[02:25:59.812 --> 02:26:01.413]  They saw how, what JFK did to him.
[02:26:01.793 --> 02:26:02.274]  I mean, this will be 50.
[02:26:02.594 --> 02:26:03.295]  I mean, look,
[02:26:04.383 --> 02:26:07.646]  They're not, the higher ups and some of their smarter ones are not stupid.
[02:26:08.427 --> 02:26:12.751]  They're like, if we, if we kill him, it'll cause way bigger problems down the road.
[02:26:12.892 --> 02:26:13.412]  Don't do it.
[02:26:13.953 --> 02:26:19.318]  But before they let him get in charge and prosecute them, which Trump said he will, he goes, I'm getting in.
[02:26:19.378 --> 02:26:22.461]  I'm going to, I'll be destroyed and you'll be destroyed with me or they'll be destroyed.
[02:26:22.481 --> 02:26:23.022]  It's a death battle.
[02:26:23.462 --> 02:26:25.143]  This isn't like some cage fight with Zuckerberg.
[02:26:25.183 --> 02:26:28.204]  And everybody's like, oh, Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, biggest thing ever.
[02:26:28.244 --> 02:26:28.785]  Yeah, great.
[02:26:29.165 --> 02:26:31.466]  Two modern emperors, tech titans.
[02:26:31.486 --> 02:26:33.987]  When Rome was collapsing, they had emperors as gladiators.
[02:26:34.007 --> 02:26:36.828]  The movie Gladiators, actually, I've got a composite of a bunch of true stories.
[02:26:37.128 --> 02:26:37.809]  That really happened.
[02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:47.773]  And the whole point is, while we're all watching this stupid stuff in the submarine and the gladiators, literally, the president who, I believe, won the election.
[02:26:47.793 --> 02:26:49.334]  You're not supposed to say that.
[02:26:49.494 --> 02:26:50.955]  Oh, he barely lost.
[02:26:52.596 --> 02:26:52.936]  Trump
[02:26:53.954 --> 02:26:57.337]  Now to have them put him in jail so we can't vote for him or whatever.
[02:26:57.357 --> 02:26:58.298]  It's just not going to fly.
[02:26:58.398 --> 02:26:59.018]  It's not going to happen.
[02:26:59.058 --> 02:27:01.961]  And so, but at the same time, you saw what Comey and others said on TV.
[02:27:02.241 --> 02:27:03.562]  Well, whatever we do, we got to stop him.
[02:27:03.922 --> 02:27:05.624]  He can't be allowed in because he'll put us in prison.
[02:27:06.064 --> 02:27:07.846]  And remember, you can pull this clip up.
[02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:09.047]  Biden said, um,
[02:27:11.081 --> 02:27:20.164]  Last December, like December 13th, I played the clip last week on my show, he said repeatedly, Biden says we will not allow Trump to be president again.
[02:27:20.444 --> 02:27:24.646]  And he says, we'll use whatever we have to with law enforcement and the constitution to make sure he's not president.
[02:27:24.886 --> 02:27:26.087]  And he just laughs arrogantly.
[02:27:26.527 --> 02:27:28.908]  He's like, people are like, hey, what about Hunter?
[02:27:29.068 --> 02:27:31.889]  He's like, you know, it's just, it's, it's lunacy.
[02:27:32.789 --> 02:27:34.250]  But, but time's running out.
[02:27:34.350 --> 02:27:35.850]  So they still have the power.
[02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:37.611]  They're still the executive in control.
[02:27:38.391 --> 02:27:42.472]  So, if you're the guy with the doomsday button and you can hit it, you think you win, but you blow yourself up at the same time.
[02:27:43.052 --> 02:27:45.812]  So, they've already destroyed themselves.
[02:27:46.232 --> 02:27:47.853]  The only question is, can they take us with them?
[02:27:47.873 --> 02:27:48.673]  We're in the season.
[02:27:50.393 --> 02:27:52.113]  We're in the time of assassination.
[02:27:53.494 --> 02:28:07.396]  So it goes without saying, in a globalist coup, the top of the execution list is Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and because
[02:28:09.482 --> 02:28:12.244]  The system trying to push around other people didn't work.
[02:28:16.148 --> 02:28:16.688]  Joe Rogan.
[02:28:18.350 --> 02:28:20.732]  Notice Joe Rogan's gotten real hardcore all of a sudden.
[02:28:20.772 --> 02:28:22.634]  He's gotten real wild.
[02:28:22.654 --> 02:28:30.541]  Because you see, somebody like Joe wants to navigate and balance things and be successful and wants to fix things peacefully.
[02:28:31.341 --> 02:28:31.822]  But see,
[02:28:33.154 --> 02:28:40.887]  When you start threatening people like that, their brains shift over and they go, well, I can't deal with these people.
[02:28:41.408 --> 02:28:43.772]  They're not going to be reasonable with me.
[02:28:44.193 --> 02:28:45.876]  I am seriously concerned.
[02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:47.118]  We should pray for President Trump.
[02:28:47.916 --> 02:28:48.957]  They know they can't beat him.
[02:28:48.977 --> 02:28:50.358]  They know he's way ahead in all the polls.
[02:28:50.839 --> 02:28:52.500]  They know these cases are going to fall apart.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.862]  They're still going to file them, as you said.
[02:28:53.882 --> 02:28:56.544]  I really do think they're going to try to kill him.
[02:28:57.325 --> 02:29:00.108]  And I think they're crazy enough to say, blow up the North Street pipeline.
[02:29:00.168 --> 02:29:01.169]  It's just, they're nuts.
[02:29:01.609 --> 02:29:03.311]  They think it'll trigger a response from us.
[02:29:04.552 --> 02:29:05.793]  What do we do about that issue?
[02:29:05.833 --> 02:29:06.794]  What do you think about that?
[02:29:06.834 --> 02:29:08.876]  And what do we do if they kill Trump, God forbid?
[02:29:10.652 --> 02:29:14.175]  Well, let's work on the thing of not having—by the way, I 100% agree with you.
[02:29:14.415 --> 02:29:16.857]  I think they're all in.
[02:29:17.157 --> 02:29:21.661]  Under no circumstances will they allow Trump to return to the White House.
[02:29:21.701 --> 02:29:22.782]  That's their thinking.
[02:29:22.842 --> 02:29:24.844]  If Trump gets back in the White House, it's game over.
[02:29:25.464 --> 02:29:27.046]  Every day will be Stalingrad once he's in.
[02:29:27.586 --> 02:29:28.107]  That's what I think.
[02:29:28.147 --> 02:29:31.289]  President Trump, he's got Secret Service protection, but I think his own personal security.
[02:29:31.669 --> 02:29:36.572]  And this is why I'm very hesitant that things like what in New York, I'm sending him into those courtrooms, things like that.
[02:29:37.013 --> 02:29:39.554]  I think, number one, you have to pray for President Trump every day.
[02:29:39.955 --> 02:29:41.496]  You have to have his back every day.
[02:29:41.956 --> 02:29:43.837]  Even people say, hey, look, he sends out mean tweets.
[02:29:43.857 --> 02:29:44.598]  Yeah, I hear all that.
[02:29:44.958 --> 02:29:46.199]  You know, I don't really care.
[02:29:46.799 --> 02:29:47.519]  He's not perfect.
[02:29:47.539 --> 02:29:48.460]  He never said he was perfect.
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:51.961]  He's a very imperfect instrument, but he's an instrument of divine providence.
[02:29:51.981 --> 02:29:52.501]  You know that in 16.
[02:29:53.442 --> 02:30:00.504]  So right now, and I share your absolute concerns about this and I think people around him, I know he does, but I think people around him also do.
[02:30:00.824 --> 02:30:02.305]  I think he's got a pretty good team down there.
[02:30:02.385 --> 02:30:08.227]  So it's a very, very, very high priority and under no circumstances can we let that happen?
[02:30:08.667 --> 02:30:09.508]  Well, absolutely.
[02:30:10.888 --> 02:30:12.489]  The globalists want to blow this country wide open.
[02:30:12.509 --> 02:30:13.529]  The Davos group has said that.
[02:30:13.549 --> 02:30:14.890]  That's why they try to cause race riots.
[02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:16.110]  They cause race riots.
[02:30:16.551 --> 02:30:18.351]  And they're salivating about killing him.
[02:30:19.092 --> 02:30:21.793]  And, you know, he's even been saying, well, I'm a martyr, fine.
[02:30:21.813 --> 02:30:24.754]  And you can see that Trump now understands.
[02:30:24.794 --> 02:30:26.755]  He's been really educated the last seven, eight years.
[02:30:27.315 --> 02:30:29.536]  He, I would say, is Trump 2.0.
[02:30:29.596 --> 02:30:30.877]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:30:31.697 --> 02:30:32.058]  A hundred percent.
[02:30:32.078 --> 02:30:32.938]  He saw that last night.
[02:30:32.958 --> 02:30:36.480]  All right, folks.
[02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:39.501]  Don't say we didn't warn you.
[02:30:40.896 --> 02:30:42.357]  We don't like saying we told you so.
[02:30:42.377 --> 02:30:43.477]  We'd love to be wrong.
[02:30:45.138 --> 02:30:46.379]  Just doesn't happen that often.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.000]  This is The Information War.
[02:30:50.221 --> 02:30:51.221]  I am Harrison Smith.
[02:30:51.441 --> 02:30:54.263]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:30:54.503 --> 02:31:00.325]  Joining me in studio is Chase Geiser and the one and only Rex Jones just entered the studio.
[02:31:00.846 --> 02:31:02.066]  Crazy day, Rex.
[02:31:02.126 --> 02:31:03.047]  Historical times.
[02:31:03.752 --> 02:31:04.712]  Absolutely wild.
[02:31:04.832 --> 02:31:13.235]  I was attending a Vesper service at the Orthodox Church, and I had this feeling about 90 minutes into the service that I should get out and leave and check my phone.
[02:31:13.255 --> 02:31:17.636]  I had this pit in my stomach, this feeling I couldn't describe, and lo and behold, what's happened?
[02:31:18.417 --> 02:31:19.177]  What has happened?
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.700]  Totally crazy.
[02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:27.263]  I mean, this is the kind of thing that you would see in the 80s with the CIA funded coup in like a Latin American country.
[02:31:27.643 --> 02:31:31.584]  This is the kind of thing you see in Stalinist Russia and Mao's China.
[02:31:31.684 --> 02:31:38.506]  We're entering into a world where the people that have called us fascists since 2016 are enacting total warfare on us.
[02:31:38.526 --> 02:31:38.506]  100%.
[02:31:39.467 --> 02:31:42.928]  100%.
[02:31:39.667 --> 02:31:42.928]  And again, it's, you know, we expected this.
[02:31:43.028 --> 02:31:47.910]  We understand our enemy and we understand the desperation that they feel with no
[02:31:50.093 --> 02:31:53.475]  A viable candidate with Trump being an absolute juggernaut.
[02:31:53.675 --> 02:31:55.276]  Everything they have tried has failed.
[02:31:56.016 --> 02:31:58.857]  I feel like I can't even remember the numbers of things they've done.
[02:31:58.877 --> 02:32:02.039]  I was trying to list them out today and it was like, where did it start, right?
[02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:03.540]  Did it start with just the lies about him?
[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:04.900]  Did it start with the mocking of him?
[02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:05.701]  They mocked him.
[02:32:05.721 --> 02:32:06.461]  They lied about him.
[02:32:06.501 --> 02:32:07.541]  They investigated him.
[02:32:07.601 --> 02:32:08.942]  They launched hoaxes about him.
[02:32:08.982 --> 02:32:10.003]  They tried to impeach him.
[02:32:10.043 --> 02:32:11.623]  They're trying to imprison him.
[02:32:12.424 --> 02:32:14.064]  I mean, they've tried everything.
[02:32:14.165 --> 02:32:14.885]  It has failed.
[02:32:15.666 --> 02:32:16.807]  They're going to try to kill him.
[02:32:16.867 --> 02:32:18.449]  It's just the obvious outcome.
[02:32:18.509 --> 02:32:19.990]  It's the obvious eventuality of all this.
[02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:20.971]  Really an easy prediction to make.
[02:32:21.612 --> 02:32:21.792]  Right.
[02:32:21.812 --> 02:32:28.038]  You know, it is impressive some of the things that Alex has gotten right in March of 2001 saying they were going to fly planes into the World Trade Centers.
[02:32:28.399 --> 02:32:29.900]  That was something nobody could have called.
[02:32:30.221 --> 02:32:37.308]  But it was very obvious to anybody who's been paying attention to politics over the last eight years or so that this was in the cards for the deep state.
[02:32:38.854 --> 02:32:40.677]  So this is a headline from The Guardian.
[02:32:40.697 --> 02:32:43.560]  There's two things that come to mind when we hear Biden's response to this in his statement.
[02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:44.061]  One is that it was
[02:32:56.363 --> 02:33:03.546]  Well, like two weeks ago, when leftists were out quite openly saying, hey, the Supreme Court says you can assassinate Trump now.
[02:33:03.606 --> 02:33:05.147]  Send SEAL Team 6 after Trump.
[02:33:05.227 --> 02:33:06.928]  They just said you can't be prosecuted.
[02:33:07.508 --> 02:33:09.529]  They tried to take his secret service away, man.
[02:33:09.569 --> 02:33:11.950]  That's what gets me in the bones.
[02:33:12.190 --> 02:33:13.330]  That's ugh, right?
[02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:14.391]  They actually tried to pass that.
[02:33:14.411 --> 02:33:15.571]  They actually put that forward.
[02:33:15.611 --> 02:33:17.912]  It was April 20th of this year.
[02:33:17.992 --> 02:33:22.914]  As a convicted felon, he was no longer eligible for protection from assassination.
[02:33:22.934 --> 02:33:23.875]  We gotta get blunt.
[02:33:24.535 --> 02:33:28.617]  Like, that's been the whole story and we laugh, but it's deadly, deadly serious.
[02:33:28.657 --> 02:33:30.138]  The predictive programming is there.
[02:33:30.158 --> 02:33:34.900]  I mean, I was watching this show that I watched season one of probably in 2020, 2021, The Boys.
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:38.342]  Season four, it's all January 6th, Antifa.
[02:33:39.402 --> 02:33:47.966]  And it's just, it's sickening that we have so many drugged up crazies in the country that they can just spin an activation wheel on and just press the button and boom, they're there.
[02:33:48.486 --> 02:33:49.547]  How did that guy get on the roof?
[02:33:50.854 --> 02:33:52.975]  Well, actually... And he was pointed out!
[02:33:53.355 --> 02:34:18.281]  Now that you mention it, there are people showing images of the building showing that there was a ladder directly to the roof, pretty much, at this point, so... I don't have that confirmed, but that is the rumor, is that they're showing satellite images of... It says, woo, at least there wasn't a ladder leading to the roof, and actually showing images of a ladder directly to this roof, so, you know, no excuse for Secret Service not having locked this down.
[02:34:18.632 --> 02:34:22.958]  You know, I've been listening to you and Chase do this broadcast basically since all this started.
[02:34:22.998 --> 02:34:34.294]  You guys have done an excellent job, but something that you said was that I don't, uh, the Secret Service, they have that kind of license to kill, perhaps something of that nomenclature, but they want to be patient, they want to be sure.
[02:34:35.629 --> 02:34:44.200]  How sure do you need to be when you got a guy on a roof that's like 100, 125 yards away according to the sound analysis by the health ranger?
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:51.048]  I mean, that's a shot that my grandfather could make with any rifle that you pick off the shelf at Academy.
[02:34:51.388 --> 02:34:51.649]  Right.
[02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:52.430]  It's horrifying.
[02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:57.553]  When it looked like the Secret Service officer was already looking at him.
[02:34:57.573 --> 02:35:04.579]  I mean, you can't know for sure, but when the shot fired and he kind of flinched away from his gun, his barrel was already pointed in that direction.
[02:35:04.599 --> 02:35:07.140]  There's no way that this guy was out of his peripheral.
[02:35:07.281 --> 02:35:08.561]  And look, I sort of get it, right?
[02:35:08.642 --> 02:35:10.043]  Like, if you put yourself in this mindset,
[02:35:10.683 --> 02:35:12.164]  There's probably one of this first guy's rodeo.
[02:35:12.204 --> 02:35:14.724]  He's probably been to dozens, if not hundreds of these things.
[02:35:14.764 --> 02:35:16.245]  Nothing like this has ever happened.
[02:35:16.365 --> 02:35:22.527]  Obviously, you know, I'm not making excuses for him, but you see, you see a head maybe pop up over a ridge.
[02:35:23.067 --> 02:35:30.650]  I can understand not just wanting to kill some random kid that decided he wanted a better view of Trump and so he's, you know, sneaking around and climbing up on the ridge.
[02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:35.632]  I get why you'd be hesitant for a second, but according to the eyewitness interview,
[02:35:36.937 --> 02:35:43.604]  They had two or three minutes where they were saying this guy's got a gun and pointing him out and trying to make Secret Service aware of this.
[02:35:43.965 --> 02:35:56.879]  Do you think that maybe the predictive programming has perhaps even worked on the Secret Service people to the point of where it's any other presidential or just president in history, any other high-ranking official with Secret Service protection, I think they make that shot.
[02:35:57.439 --> 02:36:00.461]  I think they make that shot and trust the government board to protect them.
[02:36:00.661 --> 02:36:11.528]  But since Trump is just a former president, quote unquote, of course we all know he's the real president, because he's a former president, do you think even that hesitation, that psyop has worked on his, like, guardians, his custodians?
[02:36:12.521 --> 02:36:14.162]  Uh, it would be pure speculation.
[02:36:14.202 --> 02:36:17.703]  It's pure speculation, of course, but it's very interesting to just thought experiment, think about these things.
[02:36:17.723 --> 02:36:33.227]  Well, I definitely know, uh, I was reading a book, I wish I could remember what it was called now, but it was by a veteran, it was memoirs of his time in Afghanistan, and I mean, half the book almost is dedicated to him sort of griping about the restrictions that are put on them by, really, the liberal press, and he's constantly saying, man, if
[02:36:33.906 --> 02:36:38.512]  If I had been there and I'd given the go ahead, you know, all my friends would be alive because we would have taken that guy out.
[02:36:38.552 --> 02:36:42.577]  But we hesitated because we were worried about how it was going to be portrayed in the media.
[02:36:42.597 --> 02:36:44.559]  So we didn't want to, you know, overstep our bounds.
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:47.763]  So definitely, you know, it doesn't matter how highly trained you are.
[02:36:47.783 --> 02:36:50.527]  This veteran that I was reading was a Navy SEAL.
[02:36:50.567 --> 02:36:52.209]  I mean, you can be the top of the top.
[02:36:52.589 --> 02:36:55.151]  But I've been watching the show, and Chase, you've been here with Alex when he's predicted this.
[02:36:55.171 --> 02:36:56.371]  Or similar instances like this happening.
[02:36:56.391 --> 02:36:56.892]  Dozens of times.
[02:36:56.912 --> 02:36:57.292]  You've been here.
[02:36:57.312 --> 02:36:57.952]  Speak on that.
[02:37:16.724 --> 02:37:24.450]  It always comes up in the context of the fact that everything they've tried against Trump has not only failed, but backfired.
[02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:33.156]  So they think that getting him convicted of 34 charges is going to somehow embed him in the minds of the American people as a convicted felon.
[02:37:33.196 --> 02:37:36.999]  And even the leftists on social media, they keep calling him the convicted felon, the convicted felon.
[02:37:37.019 --> 02:37:40.441]  I'd rather vote for the old guy with a good team around him than the convicted felon.
[02:37:40.501 --> 02:37:41.162]  Disgusting.
[02:37:41.202 --> 02:37:41.402]  Right?
[02:37:41.762 --> 02:37:42.443]  That's what they tried.
[02:37:43.223 --> 02:37:47.288]  We saw the hundreds of millions of dollars that came into his campaign after these false convictions.
[02:37:47.309 --> 02:37:49.151]  It was very obvious that these were kangaroo trials.
[02:37:49.331 --> 02:37:49.612]  That's right.
[02:37:49.632 --> 02:37:50.713]  The juries were all rigged.
[02:37:51.174 --> 02:37:53.416]  I mean, your dad's experienced a very similar thing.
[02:37:53.877 --> 02:37:58.743]  And so it was obvious, just sitting at the desk with Alex, that...
[02:37:59.404 --> 02:38:11.797]  All of these avenues and tactics and approaches that they've been taking to neutralize the political threat to them that is Trump and populism have backfired and they're running out of cards to play other than assassinate.
[02:38:11.817 --> 02:38:13.559]  They never want to do assassination.
[02:38:13.739 --> 02:38:16.462]  That's like a Hail Mary, last ditch thing.
[02:38:16.502 --> 02:38:21.968]  I mean, you go back to JFK, you go back to even Abraham Lincoln, nobody tried to assassinate him before the war was over.
[02:38:22.108 --> 02:38:22.308]  Right.
[02:38:22.588 --> 02:38:24.329]  It's like the last thing that happens.
[02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:27.670]  And as they were running out of cards, it's just more and more obvious.
[02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:29.070]  And your dad picked up on this.
[02:38:29.350 --> 02:38:30.010]  And I felt this.
[02:38:30.090 --> 02:38:35.692]  Others, hundreds, thousands of other people have been saying this for the last really, you know, three years or so.
[02:38:36.012 --> 02:38:37.272]  They're going to assassinate Trump.
[02:38:37.312 --> 02:38:38.993]  Even I said it in April on Twitter.
[02:38:39.013 --> 02:38:40.033]  I found it when I was looking through.
[02:38:40.053 --> 02:38:50.016]  And it's not like a prophecy that you get from God, but you just realize the audacity of these people is ultimate evil for the sake of maintaining or growing power.
[02:38:50.256 --> 02:38:50.616]  That's right.
[02:39:11.565 --> 02:39:14.527]  We've got to punch Nazis.
[02:39:14.968 --> 02:39:16.789]  We've got to take out Blondo Blumpf.
[02:39:16.849 --> 02:39:20.472]  They call him, like, Von, won't use the expletive, Craps in Pants.
[02:39:20.492 --> 02:39:24.215]  They use all these kind of insane names with no humor, no honesty.
[02:39:24.255 --> 02:39:26.297]  It's just all built on this mountain of lies.
[02:39:26.577 --> 02:39:38.346]  And when you think about it in modern American history, I'm sure there'll be some instances that I can't remember because I know there's been other presidential assassination attempts, but Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:39:38.466 --> 02:39:40.628]  JFK and Abraham Lincoln as well.
[02:39:40.888 --> 02:39:41.288]  Successful.
[02:39:41.308 --> 02:39:42.169]  And Donald Trump.
[02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.689]  Yeah.
[02:39:42.929 --> 02:39:45.790]  Which one of those now is going to be the most impactful in people's minds?
[02:39:45.890 --> 02:39:50.032]  When I thought about presidential assassinations in my past, I've always thought of Abraham Lincoln.
[02:39:50.232 --> 02:39:50.392]  Yeah.
[02:39:50.412 --> 02:39:50.592]  Right?
[02:39:50.652 --> 02:39:52.673]  You all know the famous stories and the opera.
[02:39:52.733 --> 02:39:56.134]  And everybody who was alive remembers where they were when JFK was assassinated.
[02:39:56.154 --> 02:39:57.755]  That's like a famous thing that people talk about.
[02:39:57.795 --> 02:39:58.815]  Where were you when JFK was assassinated?
[02:39:58.855 --> 02:39:59.475]  They can all tell you.
[02:39:59.635 --> 02:40:00.296]  Except for Joe Biden.
[02:40:00.316 --> 02:40:00.956]  He probably forgot.
[02:40:01.776 --> 02:40:08.840]  I really think, and I know that there's a lot of doom and gloom, and I understand that, but this is America's last dance, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:11.022]  And it's not just for us, it's for them.
[02:40:11.442 --> 02:40:14.924]  Because America, whether we love it or hate it, they're a part of it.
[02:40:14.964 --> 02:40:16.105]  The deep state is a part of it.
[02:40:16.125 --> 02:40:22.689]  They're not separated, they're not some kind of cloud that hovers over, they're among us, they're in us, they are us to a certain extent.
[02:40:22.989 --> 02:40:25.891]  And we have to realize that, and that's where the desperation comes from.
[02:40:26.331 --> 02:40:30.192]  The desperation comes from the fact that they know it's all about to be over.
[02:40:30.833 --> 02:40:35.274]  It's not just a chapter turning in the book, it's time for the new book to open, the old book's gonna be closed.
[02:40:35.594 --> 02:40:37.055]  How is the ending written?
[02:40:37.275 --> 02:40:38.556]  Everything is about that.
[02:40:39.036 --> 02:40:39.396]  What do you think?
[02:40:40.302 --> 02:40:41.823]  Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
[02:40:41.843 --> 02:40:51.089]  And Chase, you're exactly right, too, about pointing out that these people are not... It doesn't even enter into their equation whether or not this is a right or good thing to do.
[02:40:51.209 --> 02:40:53.211]  It's entirely, can we get away with it?
[02:40:53.551 --> 02:40:54.752]  Will we be blamed for it?
[02:40:54.892 --> 02:40:56.493]  You know, what is the outcome?
[02:40:56.653 --> 02:40:58.614]  You know, will we get more power or less?
[02:40:58.915 --> 02:41:00.496]  And that's the only calculus they're running.
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:14.389]  I always predicted, because if I put myself in the mindset of these people and tried to determine if I had incredible power and was super evil, how would I do things?
[02:41:15.089 --> 02:41:21.554]  I expected Trump to win and then to be assassinated at some point between his victory and the inauguration.
[02:41:22.412 --> 02:41:27.817]  And if you look at Ronald Reagan, his assassination attempt was with George H.W.
[02:41:27.877 --> 02:41:29.679]  Bush as vice president.
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:36.145]  That's another guy who apparently doesn't remember where he was on the day JFK, which is especially weird because he was in Dallas.
[02:41:36.225 --> 02:41:37.327]  So you'd think you'd remember that.
[02:41:37.998 --> 02:41:38.819]  Well, they're trustworthy.
[02:41:38.839 --> 02:41:40.160]  Yeah, you can look into that all you want.
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.281]  They're our friends.
[02:41:41.441 --> 02:41:56.313]  I've told this story before, I had a friend in Houston, big time money man for the libertarian side of things, and he's been in politics forever, to the point where he was friends with Ronald Reagan before he ever ran.
[02:41:57.222 --> 02:42:04.526]  And he said, you know, Ronald, I'm gonna support you, I'm gonna back you to the hilt, but you have to promise me not to have George Bush as your vice president.
[02:42:04.946 --> 02:42:08.928]  And Ronald Reagan came back to him saying, they're saying it has to be George H.W.
[02:42:08.948 --> 02:42:09.168]  Bush.
[02:42:09.448 --> 02:42:13.510]  So my point of all this is that if you're the deep state and you're somebody like George H.W.
[02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:22.595]  Bush, CIA, you know, drug-running assassin kingpin, you wait till you're in office as vice president and then you kill the president and usurp his power.
[02:42:22.715 --> 02:42:24.256]  Obviously that failed with Ronald Reagan.
[02:42:25.256 --> 02:42:25.917]  But that sort of
[02:42:27.074 --> 02:42:27.755]  This doesn't fit
[02:42:47.897 --> 02:42:55.646]  A fake MAGA person, a Rhino Republican and Vice President kill Trump once he's President and you have your puppet to replace him.
[02:42:56.107 --> 02:43:02.114]  So the fact that this happened before Trump got elected and before he was inaugurated to me doesn't fit as much in the
[02:43:03.115 --> 02:43:05.518]  In the game plan of the Deep State, if I were to play it out.
[02:43:05.578 --> 02:43:11.143]  No, I hear you, but at the same time, I'm also reminded of what a guest said on the show.
[02:43:11.163 --> 02:43:16.068]  He was talking with Alex, and Alex was crapping all over Mayorkas, as he rightly should.
[02:43:16.388 --> 02:43:20.573]  But the guest goes, hold on, wait a minute, we gotta show this guy respect, because he's a true enemy.
[02:43:21.013 --> 02:43:22.294]  And a true enemy is capable.
[02:43:22.374 --> 02:43:24.435]  Never underestimate your enemy.
[02:43:24.655 --> 02:43:26.076]  Big, big mistake with these people.
[02:43:26.116 --> 02:43:27.137]  You can't underestimate them.
[02:43:27.357 --> 02:43:32.540]  They have all the time in the world, all the power in the world, all the resources in the world to do whatever they want.
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:43.287]  Now, I don't want to underestimate our enemy by even assuming that my tiny brain, or all our collective tiny brains, could conceive what this kind of cybernetic Borg operation could conceive.
[02:43:43.667 --> 02:43:48.790]  But I really think they're at the time, they're at the whetstone, where they're making mistakes because they have to.
[02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:55.098]  Not because they want to, not because it's part of their plan, but because everything that's been a part of their plan has blown up in smoke.
[02:43:55.138 --> 02:43:57.881]  At the end of a game of chess, there are no good moves left.
[02:43:57.941 --> 02:43:58.742]  That's right.
[02:43:58.943 --> 02:44:00.224]  Everything is just closer to checkmate.
[02:44:00.264 --> 02:44:02.087]  Just attack, attack, attack, attack.
[02:44:02.187 --> 02:44:03.589]  Capture the king, capture the king.
[02:44:03.649 --> 02:44:04.169]  Can't do it?
[02:44:05.177 --> 02:44:05.597]  Stalemate
[02:44:23.929 --> 02:44:34.518]  Second thing is, there is still enough power in the executive branch that the establishment political class, the deep state, is intimidated or threatened by the office of the presidency.
[02:44:34.538 --> 02:44:38.281]  So a lot of people have come out and said, I'm not going to vote because our elections are canned.
[02:44:38.301 --> 02:44:41.704]  And other people have come out and said, it doesn't even matter who the president is because they're just controlled.
[02:44:42.185 --> 02:44:47.049]  Obviously that's not true if they've reached a level where they're so desperate that they're going to try to kill this guy.
[02:44:47.489 --> 02:44:50.371]  You guys played the Joe Biden press conference earlier.
[02:44:50.591 --> 02:44:51.772]  I think he looked shook up.
[02:44:52.252 --> 02:44:53.172]  That's my take.
[02:44:53.313 --> 02:44:54.573]  I think he looked scared.
[02:44:54.613 --> 02:44:58.256]  He called him Donald, his first name, whenever he ever heard that.
[02:44:58.856 --> 02:44:59.356]  Period.
[02:44:59.957 --> 02:45:00.837]  We've never heard that.
[02:45:00.877 --> 02:45:02.438]  We've never heard him be so kind.
[02:45:02.718 --> 02:45:08.622]  And the only way a sociopath like that could ever think of being kind is because he sees himself in that situation.
[02:45:09.508 --> 02:45:11.130]  Do you think he was worried that could happen to him?
[02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:12.452]  Do you think that's what it was?
[02:45:12.532 --> 02:45:14.375]  Or do you think he was shook up because he didn't die?
[02:45:14.475 --> 02:45:16.898]  Well, a wise man once said, my butt's been wiped.
[02:45:17.058 --> 02:45:17.399]  Who knows?
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:23.542]  Who knows what's going on inside there, but I think it was a moment of lucidity from Biden.
[02:45:23.882 --> 02:45:27.563]  I genuinely think that Donald... me?
[02:45:27.583 --> 02:45:29.044]  Perhaps?
[02:45:29.164 --> 02:45:31.385]  You know, like it's just... I think he realized.
[02:45:31.405 --> 02:45:34.106]  I think both of those possibilities are extremely intriguing.
[02:45:34.126 --> 02:45:37.427]  I think he knows that since that guy's not dead, this is like the end of his campaign.
[02:45:37.967 --> 02:45:39.187]  I think that's why he was shook up.
[02:45:39.227 --> 02:45:42.328]  I think he was like, oh my God, somebody tried to assassinate.
[02:45:42.369 --> 02:45:43.369]  Maybe he thought I did.
[02:45:43.409 --> 02:45:44.209]  Maybe he's behind it.
[02:45:44.249 --> 02:45:44.609]  I don't know.
[02:45:44.629 --> 02:45:46.030]  I don't think he's really behind much anymore.
[02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:49.334]  But I think that's where the fear comes from.
[02:45:50.275 --> 02:45:51.637]  I smelled it on it.
[02:45:51.697 --> 02:45:53.259]  Here's the other thing, though.
[02:45:55.001 --> 02:45:56.363]  I don't even know how to put this.
[02:45:56.403 --> 02:46:02.251]  So we heard his statement, and he says, I deplore political violence, right?
[02:46:02.311 --> 02:46:04.174]  It's just sort of these vagary terms.
[02:46:05.842 --> 02:46:13.126]  What would his speech have been like if, you know, a MAGA Trump supporter killed some politician, right?
[02:46:13.166 --> 02:46:15.647]  I don't want to use names, because I don't want to give people an idea.
[02:46:15.667 --> 02:46:17.348]  He immediately would have called it an assassination.
[02:46:17.408 --> 02:46:18.669]  He would have called it an assassination.
[02:46:18.709 --> 02:46:20.010]  He would have said, this is Trump.
[02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:21.931]  This is the danger of MAGA extremists.
[02:46:21.951 --> 02:46:23.311]  This is what I've been warning you about.
[02:46:23.391 --> 02:46:30.435]  I mean, if you can just imagine how, because he says that about Trump supporters anyway, when there wasn't an assassination attempt.
[02:46:30.775 --> 02:46:35.458]  If Kamala had a slip and fall and bruised her knees, he would have claimed that Trump greased the stairs.
[02:46:35.598 --> 02:46:36.559]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:36.599 --> 02:46:42.041]  So for him to get on air and go, well, we deplore all political violence and let's not make a big deal.
[02:46:42.401 --> 02:46:49.005]  It is so dishonest because if this had been, if the roles had been reversed, he would have been demonizing every single one.
[02:46:49.165 --> 02:46:53.907]  Cause he already, he literally is already calling us extremist and our rhetoric is dangerous and has to be silenced.
[02:46:54.288 --> 02:46:55.428]  And we haven't even done anything.
[02:46:55.448 --> 02:46:58.170]  We're the largest threat to domestic national security.
[02:46:58.210 --> 02:46:58.770]  Apparently so.
[02:47:00.174 --> 02:47:16.026]  I mean, if you look at the contrast between when Biden gave that White House speech, or wherever it was, with the red background and the Marines, you know, compared to Trump being out there under the blue sky with blood on his face, with his ears shattered, with people dead in the crowd from the assassins' bullets.
[02:47:16.226 --> 02:47:17.988]  It was literally red, white, and blue today.
[02:47:18.048 --> 02:47:19.529]  It was literally red, white, and blue.
[02:47:19.589 --> 02:47:20.189]  Who's good?
[02:47:20.349 --> 02:47:21.030]  Who's evil?
[02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:21.770]  Who's wrong?
[02:47:21.850 --> 02:47:22.351]  Who's right?
[02:47:22.431 --> 02:47:24.653]  It has never been more clear, and I think
[02:47:25.313 --> 02:47:32.596]  Just as American citizens, as patriots, as just friends of the country, I would all hope that we start calling these people who they are.
[02:47:32.616 --> 02:47:33.236]  They're fascists.
[02:47:33.797 --> 02:47:35.117]  They're dirty, dirty fascists.
[02:47:35.137 --> 02:47:35.797]  They're Nazis.
[02:47:36.218 --> 02:47:40.019]  We've been called that for about 8, 9, 10 years at this point.
[02:47:40.119 --> 02:47:42.320]  It's time to start calling them what they are.
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.441]  These people are fascist Nazis.
[02:47:44.761 --> 02:47:50.202]  Well, the crazy thing is, you know, in Germany in the 20s, the fascists and the communists were at odds with one another.
[02:47:50.322 --> 02:47:52.142]  It was either you're going to go fascist or you're going to go communist.
[02:47:52.202 --> 02:47:55.443]  And they both go to each other's rallies and try to beat the crap out of each other.
[02:47:55.983 --> 02:48:01.284]  And ultimately, the fascists won out and just eradicated communism along with millions of other people.
[02:48:01.924 --> 02:48:13.166]  But what is so alarming to me about the globalists today is that rather than being nationalist fascists like the Nazis were, and rather than being just communists because
[02:48:14.607 --> 02:48:15.909]  It implodes on itself.
[02:48:16.169 --> 02:48:20.134]  They have somehow merged both political philosophies into one thing.
[02:48:20.254 --> 02:48:23.498]  Globalism is the hybrid of fascism and communism.
[02:48:23.798 --> 02:48:28.704]  Not only are they fascist, they're fascist and communist and globalist all at once.
[02:48:29.024 --> 02:48:31.267]  It's like the holy trinity of fucking evil.
[02:48:31.647 --> 02:48:37.134]  Right now is this political philosophy refined over a century of violence, coercion, and coercion.
[02:48:37.274 --> 02:48:44.643]  People forget that the enemy learns from its mistakes and it becomes more formidable opponent over time, even as generations come and go.
[02:48:45.084 --> 02:48:48.909]  And that's why I think you hit the nail on the head that we should not underestimate these people.
[02:48:49.914 --> 02:48:51.295]  We have to fall on Christ Jesus.
[02:48:51.575 --> 02:48:57.096]  We have to call on Jesus Christ, Son of God, who died for our sins and rose on the third day.
[02:48:57.256 --> 02:49:00.857]  Jesus Christ, Son of Nazareth, Son of God, born of a virgin mother.
[02:49:00.877 --> 02:49:01.738]  We have to call on Him.
[02:49:01.778 --> 02:49:02.998]  We have to call for His protection.
[02:49:03.198 --> 02:49:06.619]  Because without His protection, Donald J. Trump would be dead right now.
[02:49:06.779 --> 02:49:07.619]  I truly believe that.
[02:49:07.699 --> 02:49:08.940]  Things like this don't just happen.
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:10.120]  It was a miracle.
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:11.601]  125 yards away.
[02:49:11.641 --> 02:49:12.301]  That's nothing.
[02:49:12.761 --> 02:49:13.681]  I am a bad shot.
[02:49:14.301 --> 02:49:15.922]  Anyone could make that shot.
[02:49:16.522 --> 02:49:18.522]  That guy couldn't, because God didn't want him to.
[02:49:18.983 --> 02:49:19.603]  That's my opinion.
[02:49:20.043 --> 02:49:22.223]  Which is absolutely wild.
[02:49:22.323 --> 02:49:32.766]  And by the way, prayers for the Trump supporter that went to hear his president do a rally and was murdered by some unhinged psychopath.
[02:49:32.786 --> 02:49:37.587]  Yeah, when Trump said, they're not after me, they're after you, I'm just in the way, that really rang true to me.
[02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:38.887]  Literally, absolutely.
[02:49:39.207 --> 02:49:40.088]  And it is.
[02:49:40.128 --> 02:49:41.128]  It was divine intervention.
[02:49:43.011 --> 02:49:44.232]  He got his ears shot off.
[02:49:44.292 --> 02:49:45.693]  I mean, what are we living through?
[02:49:45.853 --> 02:49:50.836]  It's like I almost have sympathy for the people who think it's a hoax because it's like, is this real?
[02:49:50.876 --> 02:49:51.856]  How could this be real?
[02:49:51.916 --> 02:49:54.038]  How is this actually what we're living through right now?
[02:49:54.078 --> 02:49:58.260]  The images that we're seeing, the photographs that were captured, obviously it was real.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:49:59.241]  I'm not saying it wasn't.
[02:50:00.902 --> 02:50:02.403]  It was all on video and all in picture.
[02:50:02.443 --> 02:50:04.183]  So you know, don't don't hear me wrong.
[02:50:04.243 --> 02:50:07.044]  But um, don't let people memory all this crazy.
[02:50:07.785 --> 02:50:08.645]  It's not going away.
[02:50:09.025 --> 02:50:10.146]  It's not going away this way.
[02:50:10.886 --> 02:50:11.446]  I hope so.
[02:50:11.486 --> 02:50:19.169]  But man, these people there they the cognitive dissonance with these people is so strong their ability to just smoke screen around themselves around their families.
[02:50:19.469 --> 02:50:22.090]  I mean, I was in Kirby Lane eating with a friend last week.
[02:50:22.411 --> 02:50:26.032]  And I saw a family all walk in like five or six people, you know, typical types.
[02:50:26.412 --> 02:50:28.153]  They're all wearing cloth masks.
[02:50:28.693 --> 02:50:32.535]  The children are only allowed to take the mask off to eat and they have to put it immediately on again.
[02:50:32.995 --> 02:50:33.696]  It's sickening.
[02:50:33.836 --> 02:50:36.917]  And I was sitting with my friend, and I was just speaking openly about it.
[02:50:36.937 --> 02:50:38.378]  I was just like, this is sick.
[02:50:38.958 --> 02:50:40.679]  This doesn't even follow the guidelines.
[02:50:40.759 --> 02:50:42.720]  Cloth masks are proven not to do anything at all.
[02:50:43.061 --> 02:50:43.781]  Even worse than the N95.
[02:50:43.861 --> 02:50:47.183]  And he goes, oh, you know, don't be loud about it.
[02:50:47.203 --> 02:50:48.143]  Don't make them feel uncomfortable.
[02:50:48.163 --> 02:50:50.304]  And it's like, make them feel uncomfortable?
[02:50:50.824 --> 02:50:53.206]  If someone was walking around, like,
[02:50:54.086 --> 02:50:56.768]  Flopping around like a fish and demanding that you call them a dolphin.
[02:50:57.248 --> 02:50:57.988]  What would you do?
[02:50:58.309 --> 02:51:03.812]  What would you do if that person was in charge of the country and said that everyone that didn't flop around like a dolphin lost their job?
[02:51:03.952 --> 02:51:04.172]  Yeah.
[02:51:04.452 --> 02:51:07.374]  That's infinitely better than what we got with the vaccine mandate.
[02:51:07.694 --> 02:51:12.817]  Biden through OSHA wanted 80 million American citizens to take the shot with no choice.
[02:51:13.237 --> 02:51:15.078]  No my body, my choice narrative there.
[02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:16.259]  Just take the shot.
[02:51:16.559 --> 02:51:23.483]  We're living in a world where half of the country thinks that that's for the greater good and those half of the country have either been brainwashed or they're just fascists.
[02:51:23.723 --> 02:51:25.724]  Well, here's what's, here's what's, go ahead.
[02:51:54.623 --> 02:51:58.805]  This is an InfoWars special broadcast emergency report.
[02:51:59.366 --> 02:52:00.106]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[02:52:00.366 --> 02:52:02.847]  Joining me is Rex Jones and Chase Geiser.
[02:52:03.107 --> 02:52:05.609]  We're going to be here for the time being.
[02:52:05.629 --> 02:52:06.169]  I don't know.
[02:52:06.189 --> 02:52:10.431]  I might not make it much past 11 since I do the morning show now and am not...
[02:52:10.991 --> 02:52:11.852]  Quite the night owl as I am.
[02:52:11.892 --> 02:52:12.872]  I'll pick up the ball, Harrison.
[02:52:12.892 --> 02:52:15.514]  Yeah, yeah, I'm getting less and less functional as the night goes on.
[02:52:15.534 --> 02:52:16.394]  Chasey Chase will take over.
[02:52:16.414 --> 02:52:19.796]  Yeah, Chase will have to take over for me here in a second.
[02:52:19.816 --> 02:52:21.637]  But let's go ahead and bring that video in.
[02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:25.519]  Again, I'm not seeing much information.
[02:52:25.539 --> 02:52:26.480]  This is pretty interesting.
[02:52:26.900 --> 02:52:31.683]  Colorado State Representative Steven Woodrow has just deleted his entire X account.
[02:52:32.303 --> 02:52:32.563]  Holy shit!
[02:52:32.583 --> 02:52:33.504]  Who says that?
[02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:52.971]  Well, leftists.
[02:52:52.991 --> 02:52:56.133]  The same people that say drumpf and Vaughn Pepsin Pants on Twitter.
[02:52:56.173 --> 02:52:57.495]  The same people that think they're funny.
[02:52:57.535 --> 02:52:58.856]  The same people that think they're cool.
[02:52:59.096 --> 02:53:06.823]  The same people that put cloth masks on their children and march them into a pancake restaurant and demand they only take them off for about 30 seconds of their 45 minute experience.
[02:53:06.943 --> 02:53:07.383]  That's sick.
[02:53:07.463 --> 02:53:08.224]  They don't live in reality.
[02:53:08.604 --> 02:53:09.964]  Yeah, that's that's who chase.
[02:53:10.424 --> 02:53:10.564]  Yeah.
[02:53:10.765 --> 02:53:13.525]  I mean, you're you guys are around here a lot more than I am.
[02:53:13.825 --> 02:53:15.826]  And you're kind of inundated in the newsfeed.
[02:53:15.946 --> 02:53:18.326]  And you see a lot of our people talking and making great points.
[02:53:18.686 --> 02:53:21.367]  We all forget how crazy these people are.
[02:53:21.387 --> 02:53:24.968]  Yeah, how completely insane in the membrane these people are.
[02:53:25.288 --> 02:53:26.788]  It's not a joke.
[02:53:26.808 --> 02:53:27.268]  100% very real.
[02:53:28.589 --> 02:53:31.829]  Yeah, guys, man, just that's just depressing to even think about.
[02:53:31.869 --> 02:53:33.970]  I guarantee there's people out there going right now going well.
[02:53:34.708 --> 02:53:36.893]  Maybe Trump shouldn't have said all the stuff he said then, you know?
[02:53:37.053 --> 02:53:37.855]  If you don't want to get shot.
[02:53:37.875 --> 02:53:39.519]  I mean, that's the way they think, basically.
[02:53:39.539 --> 02:53:40.681]  They're high-fiving right now.
[02:53:40.781 --> 02:53:41.543]  They're partying.
[02:53:41.603 --> 02:53:41.924]  I mean, I...
[02:53:43.886 --> 02:53:45.067]  Well, they wish they would have killed him.
[02:53:45.628 --> 02:53:46.628]  Yeah.
[02:53:46.989 --> 02:53:49.391]  The only thing the left is upset about is that he didn't die.
[02:53:49.411 --> 02:53:50.091]  Praying for death.
[02:53:50.211 --> 02:53:51.032]  Praying to the devil.
[02:53:51.072 --> 02:53:51.933]  Praying to Satan.
[02:53:52.713 --> 02:53:53.274]  Disgusting.
[02:53:53.874 --> 02:53:57.437]  Hey, if the crew can tell me whenever y'all get that video in, I do want to go to it.
[02:53:57.998 --> 02:54:04.223]  I haven't actually been able to see it yet because I just downloaded it while we're live, so make sure the audio is clear, but that should be good.
[02:54:04.243 --> 02:54:08.226]  I'm also seeing some video people are posting of places like MSNBC.
[02:54:10.322 --> 02:54:11.383]  Pretty much going mask off.
[02:54:11.743 --> 02:54:17.466]  I mean, they did go mask off when the Supreme Court decision came down saying presidents can't be prosecuted.
[02:54:18.267 --> 02:54:21.309]  There wasn't a liberal out there that wasn't saying, oh, well, I guess you have to kill Trump.
[02:54:21.329 --> 02:54:22.629]  I guess we can kill Trump now.
[02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:23.290]  Oh, good.
[02:54:23.310 --> 02:54:25.431]  It was just and brought up at that point.
[02:54:25.471 --> 02:54:26.932]  This is all Harry Sisson's fault.
[02:54:27.032 --> 02:54:27.452]  Yeah, right.
[02:54:27.532 --> 02:54:27.652]  No.
[02:54:27.672 --> 02:54:28.653]  Well, but it but it was like.
[02:54:29.975 --> 02:54:32.637]  By the way, my challenge to a duel still stands.
[02:54:32.657 --> 02:54:34.379]  2206, Texas Penal Code.
[02:54:34.559 --> 02:54:36.380]  Like, they're joking, right?
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:43.906]  They're, like, kind of being tongue-in-cheek, but it reveals, like, the truth in that if it was legal, they would kill President Trump.
[02:54:44.206 --> 02:54:45.647]  It's not about right or wrong.
[02:54:45.728 --> 02:54:52.173]  It's not about democracy, a fair playing field, people having their say and voters having a right to express themselves.
[02:54:52.633 --> 02:54:53.754]  It's about power.
[02:54:53.814 --> 02:54:54.735]  It's about destruction.
[02:54:54.755 --> 02:54:56.296]  These people are monsters, okay?
[02:54:56.676 --> 02:55:01.900]  These are people that wear Sherry Guevara t-shirts and don't know the man killed mass-murdered homosexuals.
[02:55:02.060 --> 02:55:02.581]  Yeah, right.
[02:55:02.801 --> 02:55:05.543]  Like the cognitive dissonance here, they don't do any investigation.
[02:55:05.823 --> 02:55:07.444]  They just watch a Star Wars movie.
[02:55:07.464 --> 02:55:11.047]  They say, I'm in the Rebel Alliance because the deep state tells me I am on Twitter.
[02:55:11.487 --> 02:55:13.969]  And to fulfill it, I'm going to do something like climb on a roof.
[02:55:14.249 --> 02:55:16.111]  Look at this tweet from Senator London Lamar.
[02:55:16.171 --> 02:55:18.493]  While I am praying for former President Trump and hope,
[02:55:19.233 --> 02:55:26.175]  In hopes he makes a full recovery, the extremism from the MAGA regime has brought us to this moment.
[02:55:26.255 --> 02:55:29.576]  She's blaming Trump and his supporters for his own assassination attempt.
[02:55:29.696 --> 02:55:31.136]  We call that victim blaming.
[02:55:31.616 --> 02:55:35.077]  If she wasn't wearing a short skirt, she wouldn't have gotten essayed.
[02:55:35.117 --> 02:55:36.898]  You know, that's the same kind of energy here.
[02:55:36.918 --> 02:55:37.678]  That's disgusting.
[02:55:38.318 --> 02:55:43.459]  I rebuke that, I absolutely abhor that, I stand against that as a principle.
[02:55:44.019 --> 02:55:54.561]  We have rights here in America to express ourselves freely, to hold rallies, to speak our minds, and Donald Trump is perhaps too centrist and too moderate on a lot of issues.
[02:55:54.821 --> 02:56:05.223]  And maybe, hopefully, you know, people have been having a lot of questions about Trump recently, his seriousness, you know, bringing on some people that don't look like they have the MAGA agenda at the forefront.
[02:56:06.365 --> 02:56:12.930]  I wonder how almost getting shot in the head changes a man's perspective on the seriousness of the situation that he's in and that we're in.
[02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:14.971]  I hope he's been activated in a good way.
[02:56:15.051 --> 02:56:15.171]  Yeah.
[02:56:15.191 --> 02:56:16.032]  I hope he's been activated.
[02:56:16.052 --> 02:56:17.373]  He was activated right away, man.
[02:56:17.393 --> 02:56:23.077]  When he raised his fist and said fight two or three times, I mean, the dude didn't even miss a beat.
[02:56:23.937 --> 02:56:28.520]  I would literally, if you're a person at home, I would print that as a shirt and wear it everywhere you go.
[02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:29.860]  You want to send the message?
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:31.561]  Yeah, fight, fight, fight.
[02:56:31.601 --> 02:56:36.224]  Yeah, you want to be a real good person, and you don't have to support anybody if you don't want to.
[02:56:36.604 --> 02:56:39.466]  You could go print that shirt off and wear it, and that sends a message on its own.
[02:56:39.886 --> 02:56:40.426]  Amen.
[02:56:40.466 --> 02:56:46.089]  We're joined again by Alex Jones, who's Skyping in from an undisclosed location.
[02:56:46.169 --> 02:56:46.990]  Alex, thanks for joining us.
[02:56:48.530 --> 02:56:48.930]  That's right.
[02:56:48.970 --> 02:56:51.411]  I came to Northern California for huge breaking news.
[02:56:51.991 --> 02:56:59.072]  It's going to break in the next 48 hours, but it's nothing compared to them trying to kill Trump, raising him with a bullet, the corporate media claiming it didn't happen.
[02:56:59.412 --> 02:57:08.334]  And now I'm told we have Roger Stone on the phone to respond to the attempted assassination of the 45th president of the United States.
[02:57:08.374 --> 02:57:09.634]  Let's bring in Roger Stone right now.
[02:57:11.334 --> 02:57:12.775]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:12.955 --> 02:57:14.635]  Very sadly, I think you and I
[02:57:15.327 --> 02:57:21.091]  I've talked about this on the Alex Jones Show, also on my daily show, The Stone Zone, multiple times.
[02:57:21.111 --> 02:57:26.014]  I think it was actually Tucker Carlson who first had the courage to raise the possibility.
[02:57:26.074 --> 02:57:28.896]  But look, we have an entrenched deep state.
[02:57:29.637 --> 02:57:32.759]  They're desperately afraid of the rule of law.
[02:57:32.799 --> 02:57:39.723]  They're afraid that they will be held responsible for their acts of treason in their previous attempts to take out Donald Trump.
[02:57:40.144 --> 02:57:43.506]  You and I have discussed this on the show, that there is no limit.
[02:57:43.973 --> 02:57:48.455]  There's no length to which they will not go to stop his return to the White House.
[02:57:49.575 --> 02:57:51.336]  But clearly, God has a different plan.
[02:57:51.836 --> 02:58:00.379]  Clearly, God protected Donald Trump another half an inch to the left, and we do not have a presidential candidate today.
[02:58:00.939 --> 02:58:04.720]  So I'm actually—I thank God, first of all, for his safety.
[02:58:05.301 --> 02:58:11.783]  And then you saw the quintessential Trump, where before they could hustle him off, they
[02:58:12.222 --> 02:58:20.807]  He had to signal to the crowd that he is not broken, that he will not quit, that he's not afraid.
[02:58:21.087 --> 02:58:27.871]  That moment, I think, captured the Trump I know, the Trump I love, and the Trump I'm counting on to save this country.
[02:58:27.891 --> 02:58:29.452]  Well, that's right.
[02:58:29.532 --> 02:58:31.933]  He said, fight, fight, fight.
[02:58:32.033 --> 02:58:40.858]  It was so epic that I was just, in my whole life, 50 years, I was so blown away to be experiencing
[02:58:41.627 --> 02:58:50.953]  This moment of him saying, fight, fight, fight, and then the corporate media and all the things they've done and how they tried to spin this.
[02:58:51.654 --> 02:58:53.215]  They were trying to kill him today.
[02:58:53.235 --> 02:58:55.936]  And then we know that the Secret Service stood down.
[02:58:56.037 --> 02:58:57.057]  All the experts agree.
[02:58:57.517 --> 02:58:58.738]  No one watched the rooftops.
[02:58:58.758 --> 02:59:00.019]  They let this person do this.
[02:59:00.499 --> 02:59:01.060]  I mean, Roger,
[02:59:01.838 --> 02:59:07.642]  This is like them trying to kill Kennedy and hitting him in the ear in 1963 in Dealey Plaza.
[02:59:08.082 --> 02:59:09.943]  This is them failing to kill Kennedy.
[02:59:10.283 --> 02:59:11.484]  This is so epic.
[02:59:11.824 --> 02:59:14.126]  I can't even believe I'm alive at this time, Roger Stone.
[02:59:15.106 --> 02:59:22.511]  Well, let's recognize that when Trump insisted, you could see him kind of push the Secret Service off slightly to raise his fist.
[02:59:22.931 --> 02:59:24.713]  He didn't know if there was still a live shooter.
[02:59:24.733 --> 02:59:26.614]  He didn't know if he was taking his life in his hands.
[02:59:27.454 --> 02:59:30.096]  That was a moment of bravery, a moment of courage.
[02:59:30.819 --> 02:59:36.123]  He said, oh my God, I already love Trump, now I'm completely behind 1000%.
[02:59:36.744 --> 02:59:37.985]  He said, wait, wait, wait.
[02:59:38.305 --> 02:59:40.107]  He said, fight, fight, fight.
[02:59:40.247 --> 02:59:43.409]  My God, Roger, I've been alive 50 years, you're older than I am.
[02:59:43.790 --> 02:59:45.431]  This was the most epic moment of my life.
[02:59:45.511 --> 02:59:46.812]  I can't believe we're living through this.
[02:59:47.173 --> 02:59:47.953]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:59:47.973 --> 02:59:48.854]  It was iconic.
[02:59:49.214 --> 02:59:50.075]  It was iconic.
[02:59:50.115 --> 02:59:56.040]  I think, again, every American will remember now exactly where they were when they first heard this news.
[02:59:57.316 --> 03:00:01.338]  I got a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach when I heard that shots had been fired.
[03:00:02.718 --> 03:00:08.581]  This is a direction-changing moment for the country.
[03:00:09.061 --> 03:00:11.642]  There is no way this man is now going to be stopped.
[03:00:12.622 --> 03:00:14.623]  The Democrat Party is on fire.
[03:00:15.043 --> 03:00:21.486]  They're deeply divided, as Barack Obama maneuvers behind the scenes to try to remove Joe.
[03:00:22.126 --> 03:00:24.487]  Joe now is sleeping 16 hours a day.
[03:00:25.163 --> 03:00:34.488]  Hunter Biden having total control of access to his father, who will see and speak to Pelosi, Congressman Clyburn.
[03:00:34.749 --> 03:00:35.409]  That's about it.
[03:00:35.709 --> 03:00:40.112]  They don't want him talking to anybody because they might push him out of the race.
[03:00:40.192 --> 03:00:49.397]  So not only do you have this epic civil war going on in the Democrat Party, but now you have a completely reinvigorated Donald Trump.
[03:00:50.211 --> 03:00:52.793]  Who's a martyr, a martyr for the American people.
[03:00:53.554 --> 03:00:55.615]  Thank God this came out as it did.
[03:00:55.635 --> 03:01:02.300]  I still have not, I'm not clear on whether one person, one other person or one person was killed.
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:04.041]  I heard initially that was the case.
[03:01:04.582 --> 03:01:13.428]  I can't even imagine the horror for a family of a member going to a rally and being killed because they went there to express their political views.
[03:01:13.528 --> 03:01:15.870]  I pray that that information is wrong.
[03:01:16.410 --> 03:01:18.952]  Several others are wounded, but there needs to be.
[03:01:19.708 --> 03:01:21.688]  A very aggressive investigation.
[03:01:21.748 --> 03:01:29.270]  And no, I don't trust the Biden Secret Service and the Biden Justice Department to investigate what happened here.
[03:01:29.310 --> 03:01:31.570]  House Republicans have the authority.
[03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:37.512]  It's time to actually use the authority we've given them to get to the bottom of what actually happened today.
[03:01:39.052 --> 03:01:40.432]  Roger, I totally agree.
[03:01:40.592 --> 03:01:41.993]  I mean, this isn't even real.
[03:01:42.053 --> 03:01:42.853]  It's so insane.
[03:01:44.987 --> 03:01:49.409]  Knowing Trump, he'll charge back out onto the campaign trail.
[03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:52.851]  I'm saying he should dig in at this point.
[03:01:53.272 --> 03:01:56.893]  He's got 10 points on top of his other points.
[03:01:57.034 --> 03:01:58.574]  I mean, he's 30 points ahead now.
[03:01:59.195 --> 03:02:00.916]  I mean, he's going to win a landslide.
[03:02:01.336 --> 03:02:02.737]  But I'm really concerned, Roger.
[03:02:02.757 --> 03:02:05.058]  The deep state failed this time.
[03:02:05.098 --> 03:02:06.278]  They're going to try again, Roger.
[03:02:06.599 --> 03:02:09.580]  You were on last week saying they're going to try to assassinate Trump.
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:10.881]  I'm very concerned.
[03:02:12.170 --> 03:02:20.899]  Well, my understanding is, even as we speak, Donald Trump is on his way to Denver, Colorado, where he will appear at the UFC fight today.
[03:02:20.919 --> 03:02:24.362]  I just talked to somebody who's on the plane with him.
[03:02:25.223 --> 03:02:30.908]  There is the ultimate sign of defiance, the ultimate signal that he's not giving up.
[03:02:30.968 --> 03:02:36.834]  Can you imagine the tumultuous reception he's going to get in Denver, Colorado?
[03:02:37.392 --> 03:02:44.998]  This reminds me very much, and you'll recall this in history, an attempted assassination attempt on President Theodore Roosevelt.
[03:02:45.659 --> 03:02:54.326]  The bullet, fortunately, hit him in the chest, but was stopped by a metal eyeglass container that he had in his breast pocket.
[03:02:55.067 --> 03:03:04.215]  And although he was wounded, he wasn't killed, he insisted on finishing his speech before he would allow his protectors to take him to a hospital.
[03:03:04.595 --> 03:03:05.836]  It's that same grit.
[03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:10.751]  That same determination, that same fight you see in Donald Trump.
[03:03:10.811 --> 03:03:12.512]  This guy is a brawler.
[03:03:12.912 --> 03:03:13.813]  He is a fighter.
[03:03:14.253 --> 03:03:16.394]  This will only make him double down.
[03:03:16.434 --> 03:03:17.635]  But you're right about one thing.
[03:03:18.235 --> 03:03:20.596]  They need to tighten security around him.
[03:03:21.417 --> 03:03:33.663]  The Secret Service detail that does protect him has been asking repeatedly for increases in their budget and additional manpower, and the Biden administration has ignored.
[03:03:34.116 --> 03:03:35.077]  Those requests.
[03:03:35.117 --> 03:03:37.018]  This has been going back four months.
[03:03:37.498 --> 03:03:42.362]  So I don't know what happened here, but I'm very anxious to hear the facts.
[03:03:42.882 --> 03:03:51.288]  This is either willful conspiracy or it is incompetence or some combination of both.
[03:03:52.802 --> 03:03:57.584]  Well, my issue is, I know Trump's incredible, and he only rises to the challenge.
[03:03:57.704 --> 03:04:02.485]  I'm only saying, clearly the Secret Service stood down, so he's about to walk into another trap.
[03:04:03.046 --> 03:04:11.469]  I can only admire him for his bravado and his chutzpah and his will, but Roger, there's no way to quantify this.
[03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:15.330]  You've been involved in politics since the 60s.
[03:04:15.870 --> 03:04:17.491]  I've been involved in politics since the early 90s.
[03:04:18.451 --> 03:04:20.012]  This is so epic.
[03:04:20.432 --> 03:04:22.153]  They always say truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:04:22.453 --> 03:04:26.015]  Well, truth is way more powerful than fiction.
[03:04:26.515 --> 03:04:28.156]  This is so epic.
[03:04:28.216 --> 03:04:29.316]  I'm sure you've seen the headlines.
[03:04:30.417 --> 03:04:32.618]  Forbes, AP, oh, there was an incident.
[03:04:32.658 --> 03:04:33.859]  He fell down today.
[03:04:34.539 --> 03:04:43.083]  The president, the frontrunner, who they took off the ballot, did all this stuff to get shot, and a bullet blows his ear off.
[03:04:43.664 --> 03:04:46.586]  And they're trying to pretend like it didn't happen.
[03:04:46.606 --> 03:04:53.849]  Now, they backed off that last few hours, but the attempt to say this didn't happen shows it's the deep state.
[03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:55.610]  They had their ducks lined up.
[03:04:55.650 --> 03:04:56.771]  They were ready, Roger.
[03:04:57.191 --> 03:04:58.452]  I mean, this is so epic.
[03:04:58.572 --> 03:05:02.814]  I don't even have, I mean, this is just, I am, I am speechless, Roger.
[03:05:03.955 --> 03:05:09.398]  Well, let's point out Joe Biden himself saying just the other day, it's time to put Donald Trump in the bullseye.
[03:05:10.058 --> 03:05:11.959]  Congressman Benny Thompson.
[03:05:12.406 --> 03:05:18.388]  Sponsoring legislation to strip Donald Trump of his secret service protection.
[03:05:18.948 --> 03:05:22.949]  The people responsible for this today all work at MSNBC and CNN.
[03:05:23.329 --> 03:05:30.971]  It is the people who have fomented the atmosphere of hate, who have tried to demonize Donald Trump and his supporters.
[03:05:32.152 --> 03:05:34.732]  It is right directly at their feet.
[03:05:35.173 --> 03:05:39.914]  Never forget, anything they accuse us is exactly what they are doing.
[03:05:40.453 --> 03:05:48.796]  They are the ones who have bred the atmosphere of hate that make this possible, and now their fake news media outlets try to minimize it for hours.
[03:05:48.916 --> 03:05:49.996]  Oh, Trump fell down.
[03:05:50.356 --> 03:05:51.296]  No, he didn't fall down.
[03:05:51.356 --> 03:06:02.360]  He was the target of an assassination attempt brought on by the talking heads at CNN and their relentless fomenting of hatred against the president and his supporters.
[03:06:04.060 --> 03:06:05.981]  And Roger, let's just sit back for a minute.
[03:06:07.253 --> 03:06:10.115]  We're going to take this live feed right now and post it to Real Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.716 --> 03:06:14.218]  Roger Stone response to failed attempt to assassinate Trump.
[03:06:14.518 --> 03:06:15.159]  That's the headline.
[03:06:15.659 --> 03:06:21.063]  Roger Stone response to attempted— Roger Stone response to attempt to assassinate Trump.
[03:06:21.803 --> 03:06:22.844]  It's on record.
[03:06:22.884 --> 03:06:26.467]  The Secret Service says they killed a shooter on a rooftop.
[03:06:26.907 --> 03:06:27.788]  He fired bullets.
[03:06:27.828 --> 03:06:28.948]  He hit President Trump.
[03:06:29.309 --> 03:06:32.391]  And they are literally, while they admit it happened,
[03:06:33.201 --> 03:06:35.423]  Separately running headlines saying he fell down.
[03:06:35.443 --> 03:06:38.285]  I mean, the arrogance of that.
[03:06:39.966 --> 03:06:41.688]  I don't even believe that, Roger.
[03:06:42.408 --> 03:06:49.133]  How do you even quantify that level of arrogance?
[03:06:49.874 --> 03:06:55.238]  He literally blew his ear off on national TV and they're saying nothing happened.
[03:06:55.278 --> 03:06:58.921]  I'm dumbfounded right now, actually.
[03:06:58.941 --> 03:07:01.943]  They're the same people who lied to you about Russian collusion.
[03:07:01.963 --> 03:07:02.784]  The same people
[03:07:03.308 --> 03:07:07.991]  Who lied to you that saying Trump had done something wrong in Ukraine, which was a lie?
[03:07:08.011 --> 03:07:13.876]  They're the same people who continue to push the fact there was nothing whatsoever wrong with the last election.
[03:07:13.916 --> 03:07:14.836]  It was flawless.
[03:07:15.377 --> 03:07:16.318]  It was pristine.
[03:07:16.738 --> 03:07:23.243]  The same people who insist January 6th was an insurrection, as opposed to a federal setup.
[03:07:23.643 --> 03:07:24.864]  These are the same people.
[03:07:24.984 --> 03:07:31.709]  I mean, investigators need to look how deep this conspiracy goes, because I think that there are those in the media
[03:07:32.216 --> 03:07:34.157]  Who may have been involved in this.
[03:07:34.297 --> 03:07:38.799]  That's why we need a more aggressive and a broader investigation.
[03:07:39.399 --> 03:07:40.000]  No, I totally agree.
[03:07:40.020 --> 03:07:40.420]  Let me ask you this.
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:42.141]  I think you're going to find that this is a conspiracy.
[03:07:42.361 --> 03:07:50.285]  I don't think this is a ... It's just a theory, only having written one book and now working on a second book on the attempted assassination of Reagan.
[03:07:50.865 --> 03:07:52.386]  I want to know more about this shooter.
[03:07:53.326 --> 03:07:59.189]  They've identified him as being in Antifa, but who was he in touch with in the days prior to this?
[03:07:59.999 --> 03:08:01.360]  Who was prompting this?
[03:08:01.400 --> 03:08:02.160]  Who was leading it?
[03:08:03.321 --> 03:08:03.921]  Let me ask you this.
[03:08:04.821 --> 03:08:05.862]  We don't tempt fate.
[03:08:06.002 --> 03:08:07.162]  We didn't wish this to happen.
[03:08:07.602 --> 03:08:10.744]  You were on—five days ago, we said they're going to try to kill Trump.
[03:08:11.284 --> 03:08:12.685]  You were on two weeks ago, we said it.
[03:08:12.965 --> 03:08:14.085]  It's the obvious next move.
[03:08:14.425 --> 03:08:15.566]  Tucker Carlson's pointed out.
[03:08:17.147 --> 03:08:25.090]  So, separately from what has just happened, what would have developed—and I hate to talk about this, but let's talk about it.
[03:08:26.056 --> 03:08:27.817]  Complete and total political chaos in the country.
[03:08:27.857 --> 03:08:29.678]  I have no idea what the party would have done.
[03:08:29.758 --> 03:08:33.179]  Under the party rules, the Republican National Committee would have the right to designate a new candidate.
[03:08:33.199 --> 03:08:35.420]  Since our primary and caucus
[03:08:56.161 --> 03:08:59.602]  Process is over and Trump had locked up the nomination.
[03:09:00.182 --> 03:09:06.245]  I couldn't even begin to speculate about who could fill those shoes because the truth is nobody could fill those shoes.
[03:09:06.785 --> 03:09:09.726]  My other guess, of course, is the pressure would come off Joe.
[03:09:10.326 --> 03:09:21.550]  Obama, who's right now doing everything humanly possible to get Joe to take a dive, would probably drop back to controlling Joe as he has for the last three and a half years.
[03:09:22.410 --> 03:09:23.671]  And the deep state would
[03:09:25.059 --> 03:09:26.640]  Would breathe a sigh of relief.
[03:09:27.121 --> 03:09:36.570]  The point of this, of course, is that Trump is the only political figure, the only national figure in the country who can save the country.
[03:09:37.050 --> 03:09:43.156]  He is beyond, certainly beyond the Republican Party, beyond any political figure.
[03:09:44.037 --> 03:09:48.501]  He now has, I think, supernatural strength, incredible strength.
[03:09:49.133 --> 03:09:51.115]  Uh, and this will only strengthen him further.
[03:09:51.195 --> 03:09:51.835]  Thank God.
[03:09:51.935 --> 03:09:52.736]  And that was my next.
[03:09:52.776 --> 03:09:54.037]  So stop, stop, stop.
[03:09:54.057 --> 03:09:56.539]  Because you're the, you know, 10 times more than me about politics.
[03:09:56.559 --> 03:09:58.540]  So you're, you're my superior.
[03:09:58.580 --> 03:10:03.164]  I'm not, I want to ask you then, he, this has backfired.
[03:10:03.544 --> 03:10:05.766]  How much more do they want to kill Trump now?
[03:10:06.466 --> 03:10:09.869]  Because now that they failed, obviously it's deep state attack.
[03:10:10.530 --> 03:10:11.811]  What do they do now, Roger?
[03:10:11.911 --> 03:10:16.114]  Cause they are, they just gave Trump, as you said, supernatural power.
[03:10:17.577 --> 03:10:22.919]  Well, I guess the thing we have to fear the most is another attempt, because these people are relentless.
[03:10:22.979 --> 03:10:34.384]  I mean, just as they recycle their Russian collusion crap over and over and over again, despite it being debunked and disproved, they don't have many tricks left in their arsenal.
[03:10:35.564 --> 03:10:43.588]  They clearly, you and I have talked on the air about the possibility of another fake pandemic, but I think they have put that aside.
[03:10:44.028 --> 03:10:46.629]  My guess is that all their eggs were in this basket.
[03:10:47.612 --> 03:10:50.454]  Above all, they need to tighten security around Trump.
[03:10:50.494 --> 03:10:55.057]  They certainly need to tighten security around the upcoming Republican National Convention.
[03:10:55.878 --> 03:10:58.339]  I think the deep state is out of tricks.
[03:10:58.619 --> 03:11:02.342]  I think Trump's assent to the White House is virtually assured.
[03:11:02.922 --> 03:11:05.844]  The key to that, of course, is that he has to still be breathing.
[03:11:05.984 --> 03:11:11.708]  So, I think it is essential they beef up security and that we continue to pray.
[03:11:12.228 --> 03:11:13.409]  Our prayers have worked here.
[03:11:14.102 --> 03:11:14.702]  Incredibly.
[03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:16.744]  Let's just kind of review what's happened here.
[03:11:44.341 --> 03:11:45.061]  I'm a politico.
[03:11:45.122 --> 03:11:47.023]  I'm not a preacher, but I'll take a shot at this.
[03:11:48.664 --> 03:11:57.168]  Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you, firstly, for protecting your servant, Donald J. Trump, because you have for him a specific mission.
[03:11:57.749 --> 03:12:04.072]  We ask your continued protection of Donald Trump and his family and all his supporters.
[03:12:04.933 --> 03:12:13.398]  In every great battle in the Bible, your forces, Lord, are always outnumbered, yet they are always victorious.
[03:12:13.996 --> 03:12:16.157]  So once again, we pray for your protection.
[03:12:16.837 --> 03:12:18.598]  We pray to you for guidance.
[03:12:19.138 --> 03:12:20.599]  We pray to you for wisdom.
[03:12:21.159 --> 03:12:22.680]  We praise to you for strength.
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:32.665]  And we thank you, Lord, for giving this, your servant, Donald Trump, the most unlikely president, the most unlikely savior of this nation.
[03:12:32.765 --> 03:12:34.426]  Please afford us your protection.
[03:12:34.886 --> 03:12:38.167]  In God's name, we ask you humbly, Lord.
[03:12:38.748 --> 03:12:39.308]  God bless you.
[03:12:40.066 --> 03:12:41.927]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[03:12:41.987 --> 03:12:56.213]  This has been a tumultuous and gut-wrenching night, but I appreciate and salute the entire crew there at InfoWars for bringing us all the latest and the things you won't see at MSNBC or CNN.
[03:12:57.463 --> 03:13:00.045]  Well, it's the reality and the genuineness of it.
[03:13:00.385 --> 03:13:15.054]  Roger, I love you, and I care about you, and I care about Trump, and I went from like, you know, Trump's a real guy, I admire him, but after this, he is just, I mean, everybody I know is like, the new world order's in trouble.
[03:13:15.294 --> 03:13:17.356]  Can you believe they didn't kill him, man?
[03:13:17.376 --> 03:13:18.516]  They shot right at him.
[03:13:19.157 --> 03:13:20.938]  Like, this is epic.
[03:13:23.428 --> 03:13:24.568]  I could not agree more.
[03:13:24.648 --> 03:13:26.129]  We're going to save this country, Alex.
[03:13:26.189 --> 03:13:26.789]  God bless you.
[03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:27.689]  Guys, have a good night.
[03:13:28.769 --> 03:13:29.069]  Thank you.
[03:13:29.489 --> 03:13:31.710]  I mean, folks, thank you.
[03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:34.851]  I'm going to end this here in a moment because I've been up since 5 a.m.
[03:13:34.871 --> 03:13:36.691]  And I'm out here in California.
[03:13:36.731 --> 03:13:38.051]  We had a huge story.
[03:13:38.812 --> 03:13:39.972]  I mean, big, folks.
[03:13:40.452 --> 03:13:41.192]  And it's still there.
[03:13:41.912 --> 03:13:44.193]  I was supposed to be off-beat with folks right now to get this.
[03:13:45.113 --> 03:13:49.314]  And it's not even real how big this is.
[03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:57.544]  Like they literally shot him in the face and the corporate media tried for eight hours to say, oh, it was nothing.
[03:13:57.604 --> 03:13:58.284]  He fell down.
[03:13:58.565 --> 03:14:00.426]  Now they're like, oh, they tried to assassinate him.
[03:14:00.766 --> 03:14:01.486]  No big deal.
[03:14:01.907 --> 03:14:05.148]  An assassination is no big deal.
[03:14:05.709 --> 03:14:09.211]  My God, I am so blessed.
[03:14:10.592 --> 03:14:13.273]  I am so honored that I'm not one of them.
[03:14:15.714 --> 03:14:18.116]  I'm so blessed that I'm not some fake person.
[03:14:18.775 --> 03:14:22.959]  That's got to sit here and think about what I want to say, because I'm telling you a lie.
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:27.263]  I just this is so epic.
[03:14:27.503 --> 03:14:34.449]  I mean, they literally shot Donald Trump in the face today and they tried to say it didn't happen.
[03:14:35.490 --> 03:14:36.491]  I mean, I just.
[03:14:37.912 --> 03:14:38.793]  Dad, I got to chime in.
[03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:39.614]  I got to chime in here.
[03:14:39.854 --> 03:14:40.655]  I got to chime in here.
[03:14:41.462 --> 03:14:42.442]  The event security failed him.
[03:14:42.462 --> 03:14:43.543]  Oh, Rex Jones, my son, go ahead.
[03:14:43.783 --> 03:14:44.703]  Yes, sir.
[03:14:44.743 --> 03:14:45.943]  The event security failed him.
[03:14:46.163 --> 03:14:47.884]  His own custodian guard failed him.
[03:14:48.144 --> 03:14:49.444]  But God didn't fail him tonight.
[03:14:49.905 --> 03:14:51.385]  God saved his butt.
[03:14:52.045 --> 03:14:57.347]  And we all have to be grateful to Christ Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, who died and rose on the third day.
[03:14:57.387 --> 03:15:02.188]  We have to give all glory and praise to Him, because without Him, none of this would truly be possible.
[03:15:02.668 --> 03:15:08.110]  We all have to offer up our prayers to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of God,
[03:15:09.281 --> 03:15:22.545]  Born of a virgin, who died and rose on the third day, we have to give thanks to Him because it is our Lord and His providence and His infinite grace that, just like Roger said, chose the most unlikely person to possibly bring us the victory.
[03:15:22.945 --> 03:15:27.907]  And it's all up to Him, and it's all up to us, and we have to keep on offering our prayers unto the Lord.
[03:15:28.427 --> 03:15:34.491]  We have to call on Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of God, who died and rose on the third day.
[03:15:34.851 --> 03:15:36.252]  The enemy has all this power.
[03:15:36.292 --> 03:15:38.053]  They have the ability to do many things.
[03:15:38.093 --> 03:15:38.934]  They control the media.
[03:15:38.954 --> 03:15:39.775]  They control the government.
[03:15:39.815 --> 03:15:45.118]  They have almost an infinite wealth, but they don't have the true infinite wealth, and that is Jesus's name.
[03:15:45.518 --> 03:15:47.039]  They can't call on Jesus Christ.
[03:15:47.500 --> 03:15:49.701]  We have to do that, and that will save our country.
[03:15:49.981 --> 03:15:51.042]  I don't know how it happens.
[03:15:51.422 --> 03:15:54.464]  I don't know if it takes Trump losing and some more craziness to truly unfold.
[03:15:54.504 --> 03:15:54.985]  I don't know.
[03:15:55.025 --> 03:15:55.965]  I don't want that to happen.
[03:15:56.025 --> 03:15:58.027]  I just pray for God to save us.
[03:15:58.587 --> 03:16:01.354]  They literally just shot him in the face, Rex.
[03:16:01.394 --> 03:16:02.437]  You're right.
[03:16:03.580 --> 03:16:04.462]  You're right, Rex.
[03:16:04.482 --> 03:16:06.226]  They just literally shot him in the face.
[03:16:06.748 --> 03:16:07.971]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:16:10.552 --> 03:16:11.713]  We just have to give our thanks to God.
[03:16:11.933 --> 03:16:29.441]  You know, the crews bring this up, and I didn't even think about it, but the assassination that kicked off World War I, Franz Ferdinand, was a failed assassination attempt at first, and it was later in the day that he went back out and was assassinated, and that kicked off World War I. Yeah, that's my concern, with a hand grenade.
[03:16:29.961 --> 03:16:30.601]  Exactly.
[03:16:30.782 --> 03:16:33.623]  Trump needs to... Everybody's like, oh, Trump's tough.
[03:16:33.803 --> 03:16:34.583]  No, they're gonna kill him.
[03:16:35.464 --> 03:16:35.764]  Watch.
[03:16:36.890 --> 03:16:48.500]  I think what the health ranger said about dirty bombs and possible false flag nuclear attacks happening and Ukraine using that as a pretext, I think that's very possible and that's the true threat in all of this is escalation.
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:57.468]  They always want to escalate because their story is so rotten and so bad and so crooked that when the months and months go on and more is revealed, everyone looks at it.
[03:16:57.768 --> 03:16:59.029]  So they're forced to rotate.
[03:16:59.109 --> 03:17:01.089]  That news cycle exists for a reason.
[03:17:01.430 --> 03:17:05.151]  They create it to distract us, and they're zombies, they're slaves.
[03:17:05.451 --> 03:17:14.475]  They live in such a compartmentalized, imaginary land, imaginary world, that they're willing to believe anything as long as it's new and fresh in their minds, because they have no memory.
[03:17:14.855 --> 03:17:15.876]  The devil does not allow the devil.
[03:17:15.896 --> 03:17:17.838]  That's exactly, Rex, you're right.
[03:17:17.898 --> 03:17:20.601]  That's what I'm saying is they just failed.
[03:17:21.001 --> 03:17:22.163]  What are they about to do?
[03:17:22.563 --> 03:17:24.185]  We better be talking about that.
[03:17:24.425 --> 03:17:28.349]  They just literally shot Trump and it literally grazed his head.
[03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:29.690]  What are they ready to do?
[03:17:29.751 --> 03:17:31.012]  They're going to go for broke.
[03:17:31.667 --> 03:17:35.731]  I mean, through the grace of God, that shot, 125 yards, is nothing.
[03:17:35.872 --> 03:17:40.176]  I took my friend deer hunting, and we got him his first deer in the fall of 2023.
[03:17:42.038 --> 03:17:44.221]  And, I mean, he was shooting bullseye at like 150.
[03:17:45.802 --> 03:17:49.246]  After just a couple days being on the range with a rifle, having shot a rifle with a deer.
[03:17:49.306 --> 03:17:51.449]  Well, the difference is, a deer stops and eats corn.
[03:17:52.190 --> 03:17:52.971]  Trump was moving.
[03:18:10.390 --> 03:18:17.517]  I mean, when you look at that guy and you look at the media and they've kind of tried to... Shot in the ear, sees the blood on his fingers, immediately ducks.
[03:18:17.557 --> 03:18:22.582]  He checks first, like with his hand, and he looks at his fingers and he sees the blood and he's like, oh, I've been shot.
[03:18:22.622 --> 03:18:25.905]  And we've been told that, oh, Trump's got cognitive problems.
[03:18:26.005 --> 03:18:27.527]  Biden's actually a Mensa student.
[03:18:27.547 --> 03:18:28.788]  Yeah, Biden wouldn't have survived that.
[03:18:29.368 --> 03:18:35.331]  Biden wouldn't have a hope and a prayer, and it's not just because he's old and senile, it's because he doesn't have the blessing of God.
[03:18:35.771 --> 03:18:41.893]  All these people, for all their technology and all their money and all their resources, they don't have the blessing of God.
[03:18:41.933 --> 03:18:43.014]  They don't have any luck.
[03:18:43.514 --> 03:18:45.075]  And luck is the only thing we have.
[03:18:45.115 --> 03:18:47.176]  It's only through luck that InfoWars is still here.
[03:18:47.196 --> 03:18:47.836]  Yeah.
[03:18:48.456 --> 03:18:49.577]  And people don't realize that.
[03:18:50.477 --> 03:18:52.378]  Yeah, they call it luck, but you're right, it's a blessing.
[03:18:52.638 --> 03:18:53.038]  That's right.
[03:18:53.198 --> 03:18:56.360]  Like, we were supposed to be, you saw the news, we were supposed to be shut down.
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:18:56.720]  We ain't.
[03:18:57.020 --> 03:18:57.300]  We ain't.
[03:18:58.812 --> 03:19:00.173]  People say, well, why aren't you shut down yet?
[03:19:00.213 --> 03:19:03.394]  Because God gives us that next inch every day.
[03:19:04.695 --> 03:19:06.876]  But God shows us it's only me doing this.
[03:19:07.376 --> 03:19:07.756]  That's right.
[03:19:07.776 --> 03:19:08.156]  Only God.
[03:19:08.697 --> 03:19:16.200]  And the second we forget that, and the second we stop offering Him praise through our words and through our actions, is the second we lose.
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:17.681]  That's what people forget.
[03:19:18.261 --> 03:19:26.685]  If we take a second to become like them, to become evil, to become hubristic, and we say, oh, we're winning, we're great, we're a MAGA, I mean,
[03:19:27.185 --> 03:19:42.441]  In 2020, I stopped working here, and there was a bit of a thing that happened, but I essentially went up to a rally with Owen Schroyer in Dallas, and it was kind of this GOP event, and there were probably like three or four hundred people there, and I saw middle-aged women in the street twerking to MAGA music.
[03:19:43.002 --> 03:19:45.084]  Twerking to MAGA music, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:45.704 --> 03:19:49.086]  And that spirit, thank God, has left us now.
[03:19:49.446 --> 03:19:52.227]  That spirit of, oh, it's all a party, has left us now.
[03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:54.008]  This isn't a big celebration.
[03:19:54.048 --> 03:19:54.868]  This isn't a TV show.
[03:19:54.888 --> 03:19:55.368]  It's a war.
[03:19:55.688 --> 03:19:56.549]  This isn't a piece of media.
[03:19:56.629 --> 03:19:56.869]  It's a war.
[03:19:56.889 --> 03:19:57.569]  This is real.
[03:19:57.969 --> 03:20:00.911]  This is real life and it's happening in real time right now.
[03:20:01.291 --> 03:20:03.251]  And people need to realize that this isn't a video game.
[03:20:03.271 --> 03:20:04.372]  I agree.
[03:20:04.392 --> 03:20:04.612]  Go ahead.
[03:20:04.952 --> 03:20:13.776]  So guys, take that Roger Stone clip where you sit live and say, Roger Stone, exclusive, Roger Stone responds to a timid assassination of Trump.
[03:20:14.952 --> 03:20:16.433]  I'm going to let you guys continue on.
[03:20:16.573 --> 03:20:17.053]  I love you.
[03:20:17.213 --> 03:20:21.975]  We are here in Northern California and it's already late enough to tell people.
[03:20:22.655 --> 03:20:24.836]  I'm not going to tell you yet.
[03:20:25.757 --> 03:20:35.001]  So we were here for some big news, which I'm just, I cannot be so thankful that Trump didn't get killed today because I love Trump.
[03:20:35.041 --> 03:20:39.143]  He's a great guy, but he, he embodies our resistance.
[03:20:39.933 --> 03:20:43.516]  And you're like, oh, it'd be a bigger thing if they killed him.
[03:20:43.596 --> 03:20:45.097]  No, they failed.
[03:20:45.597 --> 03:20:47.138]  My big issue is they're going to try again.
[03:20:47.658 --> 03:20:48.699]  So I love you guys.
[03:20:48.899 --> 03:20:50.020]  You guys continue on.
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:53.062]  I would advise you to man up.
[03:20:53.782 --> 03:20:54.783]  And I'll come back in an hour.
[03:20:55.243 --> 03:20:56.084]  Do not stop.
[03:20:56.384 --> 03:20:57.705]  They tried to kill the president.
[03:20:57.825 --> 03:20:58.926]  Don't take this like it's normal.
[03:20:59.306 --> 03:21:00.347]  Take clips out of the show.
[03:21:00.387 --> 03:21:01.407]  Get up on my Twitter.
[03:21:01.788 --> 03:21:02.988]  Everybody says I run my Twitter.
[03:21:04.009 --> 03:21:05.290]  Yeah, 9% of it's me.
[03:21:06.411 --> 03:21:07.972]  I'm telling you guys, take clips out of the show.
[03:21:09.173 --> 03:21:09.573]  Get it up.
[03:21:10.959 --> 03:21:13.700]  Because this is history that it's happening.
[03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:14.440]  I'll say it again.
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:17.860]  I cannot fight the new world order without you.
[03:21:18.321 --> 03:21:19.981]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:21:20.281 --> 03:21:21.901]  Go to DrJonesNationals.com.
[03:21:22.281 --> 03:21:23.242]  Get the products.
[03:21:23.282 --> 03:21:25.422]  Man, we are fighting hard.
[03:21:25.702 --> 03:21:26.822]  We are real, folks.
[03:21:26.862 --> 03:21:27.582]  You can see it.
[03:21:27.862 --> 03:21:28.683]  The enemy hates us.
[03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:29.503]  We don't back down.
[03:21:29.563 --> 03:21:30.583]  I told you to try to go Trump.
[03:21:30.923 --> 03:21:32.463]  Go to DrJonesNationals.com.
[03:21:32.964 --> 03:21:34.324]  Support us right now.
[03:21:34.704 --> 03:21:35.104]  We'll do
[03:21:36.002 --> 03:21:39.685]  Incredible things together, but we cannot do it without you.
[03:21:40.066 --> 03:21:41.387]  So, I'm really blessed.
[03:21:41.427 --> 03:21:42.408]  I'm glad you're here tonight, Rex.
[03:21:42.488 --> 03:21:43.388]  I love my son.
[03:21:43.568 --> 03:21:43.969]  Thank you.
[03:21:44.569 --> 03:21:46.891]  Dad, before you go, before you go, just one more thing.
[03:21:46.971 --> 03:21:52.556]  Your prayer earlier is what led me to come to the office and try to get on camera with the great crew today and speak.
[03:21:52.956 --> 03:21:56.680]  I mean, it was so powerful when you started crying, you started calling out Jesus' name.
[03:21:56.780 --> 03:21:57.540]  I hear you pray.
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:21:58.561]  I hear you say things.
[03:21:58.881 --> 03:22:03.786]  When you spoke in that way, I mean, I was attending a Vesper service at the Orthodox Church
[03:22:04.666 --> 03:22:14.799]  And I got this feeling in my gut about 80-90 minutes in, after the service was almost over but it was still going on, that I should leave and that I should go out to my car and that I should check the news.
[03:22:14.859 --> 03:22:18.964]  Not that I have any selfish desire to leave, but something felt deeply wrong to me.
[03:22:19.285 --> 03:22:23.150]  And of course, the first thing I do, always when I have that feeling, is I go to Bandot Video.
[03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:38.107]  I go to Bandot Video, I see these two great gentlemen streaming, and then I see you get on, and as I'm driving home from the church service, I felt very connected to God at the moment in the church service, but when I heard you cry out that prayer, when I heard you cry out Jesus' full name, that's what we have to do, Dad.
[03:22:38.527 --> 03:22:52.119]  So I just, I pray to Christ Jesus, Son of God of Nazareth, born of a virgin mother who died on the cross and rose three days later, who took our sins upon him and plundered Hades and trampled the devil.
[03:22:52.219 --> 03:22:54.461]  I pray to him and I just pray for his providence.
[03:22:54.501 --> 03:22:55.382]  I pray for his love.
[03:22:55.702 --> 03:22:59.025]  I pray for his mercy, not only for Donald Trump, but for Joe Biden.
[03:22:59.345 --> 03:23:00.566]  I pray for Joe Biden, Lord.
[03:23:00.666 --> 03:23:01.507]  I pray that he's well.
[03:23:01.547 --> 03:23:04.390]  I pray that he makes it through this race and whatever happens to him happens to him.
[03:23:04.410 --> 03:23:05.311]  And if he's prosecuted,
[03:23:06.011 --> 03:23:06.472]  So be it.
[03:23:06.492 --> 03:23:10.778]  I just, I pray for everyone's safety because this is not what we want.
[03:23:11.679 --> 03:23:12.740]  This is not what we want.
[03:23:13.622 --> 03:23:14.663]  This is not what we want.
[03:23:15.184 --> 03:23:17.146]  It's time for all of us to wake up.
[03:23:19.667 --> 03:23:20.367]  It's a TV show.
[03:23:20.727 --> 03:23:22.688]  All the TV shows you see are horrible.
[03:23:23.328 --> 03:23:24.708]  It's a nightmare realm.
[03:23:25.168 --> 03:23:27.349]  We don't want to live in that world, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23:27.629 --> 03:23:29.609]  We don't want to be characters in a show.
[03:23:29.889 --> 03:23:34.611]  We want to be free-willed, free actors that are free of that garbage, and it's been put on us.
[03:23:34.691 --> 03:23:40.552]  It's very seductive, the way it pulls at you, the best-looking people, the best scriptwriting, the best plots, all of it.
[03:23:40.812 --> 03:23:42.052]  But it's all a lie.
[03:23:42.132 --> 03:23:43.313]  It's not the real world.
[03:23:43.373 --> 03:23:44.353]  It's not reality.
[03:23:44.673 --> 03:23:48.954]  And when you see people, and they're so sucked in, and they're so dead, and I was like that for such a long time,
[03:23:49.494 --> 03:23:52.296]  It's such an evil spirit that we all have to rise above.
[03:23:52.336 --> 03:23:54.578]  We don't want to be their characters in their sick play.
[03:23:56.439 --> 03:23:56.679]  Amen.
[03:23:56.879 --> 03:23:57.820]  I totally agree, Rex.
[03:23:57.860 --> 03:23:58.760]  I love you, son.
[03:23:58.780 --> 03:24:00.522]  Alright, you guys take over.
[03:24:00.542 --> 03:24:01.842]  I'm going to be back here more.
[03:24:02.463 --> 03:24:03.123]  Love you all.
[03:24:03.243 --> 03:24:03.864]  God bless.
[03:24:04.724 --> 03:24:08.187]  They literally shot Trump in the face today and he lived.
[03:24:08.547 --> 03:24:10.028]  This is an epic time to be alive.
[03:24:10.588 --> 03:24:11.509]  Get the videos out.
[03:24:11.549 --> 03:24:12.149]  God bless you.
[03:24:12.169 --> 03:24:12.710]  Take over, crew.
[03:24:13.700 --> 03:24:13.940]  Wow.
[03:24:14.381 --> 03:24:18.948]  No, historical, historic moment to be here and thank God we are here.
[03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:23.135]  InfoWarsStore.com, Band.Video, InfoWars.com.
[03:24:23.876 --> 03:24:27.321]  What an incredible time to be here at the headquarters.
[03:24:28.723 --> 03:24:32.545]  And I've been covering some stuff, or I've been looking up some of the latest news.
[03:24:32.805 --> 03:24:33.865]  We do have some updates.
[03:24:34.465 --> 03:24:37.306]  Very little information is coming out, but information is coming out.
[03:24:37.346 --> 03:24:44.389]  The shooter at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania has been identified by the FBI as a 20-year-old male from the local Butler County area.
[03:24:44.849 --> 03:24:50.992]  His identity has not been released to the public yet, but we will keep you up to date as soon as that information comes in.
[03:24:51.452 --> 03:24:57.915]  Some supposed images of the gunman are coming in, but I'm going to hold off on those until I see them from an official source.
[03:24:58.775 --> 03:24:59.435]  I don't know.
[03:25:15.283 --> 03:25:15.803]  We're good.
[03:25:33.655 --> 03:25:34.055]  Constant.
[03:25:34.175 --> 03:25:36.036]  It is practically a constant.
[03:25:36.417 --> 03:25:37.597]  This is supposedly one of the pictures.
[03:25:37.637 --> 03:25:38.037]  I don't know.
[03:25:38.237 --> 03:25:39.318]  Is this confirmed?
[03:25:39.758 --> 03:25:39.998]  No.
[03:25:40.018 --> 03:25:47.362]  We gotta be careful showing images of people until we know that they're actually... Yeah, none of that is confirmed as far as I know unless the crew can tell me otherwise.
[03:25:47.682 --> 03:25:48.383]  I don't think so.
[03:25:48.423 --> 03:25:50.664]  All we know is that he was a 20-year-old from a local area.
[03:25:51.144 --> 03:25:52.965]  No name provided yet.
[03:25:53.446 --> 03:25:59.329]  Apparently, according to Spectator Index, Elon Musk has said two people have attempted to kill him over the last eight months.
[03:26:00.109 --> 03:26:04.112]  So, just know it's not just Trump that is coming under this violence.
[03:26:04.573 --> 03:26:09.737]  Yeah, and Elon did formally endorse President Trump tonight.
[03:26:09.917 --> 03:26:12.600]  Yes, yeah, very strongly as well.
[03:26:13.540 --> 03:26:16.283]  I think that's all the new information we have gathered.
[03:26:16.423 --> 03:26:17.844]  A lot of speculation about this.
[03:26:17.864 --> 03:26:21.147]  A lot of people now entering into the DEI conversation.
[03:26:21.187 --> 03:26:24.490]  Obviously, we've seen massive disasters from places like Boeing.
[03:26:25.210 --> 03:26:27.332]  That a lot of people are attributing to their DEI practices.
[03:26:27.372 --> 03:26:34.639]  Now people are pulling up videos of the head of Secret Service talking about how they're desperate to get 30% women in the force and that sort of thing.
[03:26:34.679 --> 03:26:39.363]  So people are not happy with the Secret Service and are looking for what went wrong here.
[03:26:39.383 --> 03:26:41.505]  Because obviously something did.
[03:26:41.805 --> 03:26:43.847]  We also have some more videos we can go to if we want.
[03:26:43.867 --> 03:26:50.954]  Apparently CNN's Jamie Gannell attacks Trump for saying fight, fight, fight after somebody tried to murder him.
[03:26:51.614 --> 03:26:55.077]  Literally, she complains about what he did five seconds after he was shot.
[03:26:55.417 --> 03:26:56.218]  Oh my god.
[03:26:56.238 --> 03:26:59.100]  Saying, quote, that's not the message we want to be sending right now.
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:00.621]  We want to tamp that down.
[03:27:01.122 --> 03:27:01.782]  Who's we?
[03:27:02.083 --> 03:27:02.703]  Who's we?
[03:27:02.723 --> 03:27:03.864]  Yeah, there is no we here.
[03:27:03.884 --> 03:27:04.745]  Yeah, there is no we.
[03:27:05.105 --> 03:27:07.427]  And that's, that is the other thing I'm seeing is people saying
[03:27:08.430 --> 03:27:10.011]  Hey guys, this is war.
[03:27:10.071 --> 03:27:11.011]  Like, they want us dead.
[03:27:11.351 --> 03:27:15.853]  They're not enough, you know, no more just... They don't want us to fight, they just want us to get shot.
[03:27:16.233 --> 03:27:17.754]  Don't fight back is what they're really saying.
[03:27:17.774 --> 03:27:19.595]  They're not saying don't fight, they're saying don't fight back.
[03:27:19.775 --> 03:27:19.955]  Right.
[03:27:19.995 --> 03:27:25.497]  When we try to kill you, just accept it and, you know, realize you're the bad one and don't tell anybody.
[03:27:25.517 --> 03:27:34.821]  Like that scene from Saving Private Ryan where the Nazi is bringing down the knife and just whispers, shh shh shh, like he's your friend and you finally give up and you're just dead.
[03:27:35.361 --> 03:27:37.642]  Like, that's what they're trying to do to this country right now.
[03:27:37.662 --> 03:27:42.025]  They've got the blade right at the country's face and they're just trying to whisper sweet nothings so we give in.
[03:27:42.445 --> 03:27:48.988]  They're only like that because they know that guillotine is behind their neck and they think that they can dodge it in time if we roll over and die.
[03:27:49.368 --> 03:27:50.069]  Here's the thing.
[03:27:50.169 --> 03:27:52.750]  We have to walk in the spirit of Elijah, the spirit of Christ.
[03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:53.831]  Here's what we have to do.
[03:27:54.511 --> 03:28:15.051]  We have to boldly, bravely, and fearlessly expose what they are doing, because if we're able to break their news cycle just for a second, just for a month or two, if we're able to get the message out that, hey, they let 30 million people into the country conservatively, they want to sign all women up for the national draft, their sacrament is literally the sacrament of Satan.
[03:28:15.732 --> 03:28:17.934]  Like, their whole domestic policy is just abortion.
[03:28:18.749 --> 03:28:19.910]  That's how they want to win elections.
[03:28:41.394 --> 03:28:45.437]  The fact they're putting this guy's information out means he has probably been scrubbed from the internet.
[03:28:45.517 --> 03:28:46.738]  That is going to be my guess.
[03:28:46.778 --> 03:28:49.059]  Yeah, we don't have a photo of this guy besides him dead.
[03:28:49.519 --> 03:28:50.440]  We have the dead photo.
[03:28:50.480 --> 03:28:52.041]  We have supposed photos.
[03:28:52.762 --> 03:29:00.267]  But, you know, one of the things that will typically happen in these circumstances is the name will come out, will be leaked somehow or there'll be speculation.
[03:29:00.287 --> 03:29:05.470]  They'll find a ton of social media posts by the person and then it all gets taken down.
[03:29:05.490 --> 03:29:06.651]  But usually there's a little bit of a
[03:29:07.171 --> 03:29:16.508]  But the fact that this guy's name hasn't been put out till right now makes me think there's probably not too much to find about him, but I wonder what will be uncovered about Thomas Matthew Crooks.
[03:29:16.829 --> 03:29:18.411]  If it can be found, it will be found.
[03:29:18.905 --> 03:29:21.447]  You know, I've seen a lot of Andy Ngo content.
[03:29:21.667 --> 03:29:25.069]  The Portland Antifa journalist type guy.
[03:29:25.369 --> 03:29:27.290]  The milkshake dude who got the milkshake thrown at him.
[03:29:27.731 --> 03:29:32.734]  I've seen him speak a lot about these kinds of folks and usually they are from like the dregs of society.
[03:29:32.874 --> 03:29:41.520]  Like they'll recruit literally somebody who has zero friends, has never had any friends, doesn't have a family, doesn't have any kind of financial support or background.
[03:29:41.960 --> 03:29:42.320]  We're good to go.
[03:30:03.459 --> 03:30:08.301]  One person died, two critically injured, Trump moderately injured, whatever you want to call it.
[03:30:08.421 --> 03:30:12.642]  Yet another Trump supporter murdered in political violence.
[03:30:13.682 --> 03:30:16.803]  Ashley Babbitt, five others on January 6th.
[03:30:17.543 --> 03:30:20.144]  But wait, all those Capitol Police officers, they were all murdered.
[03:30:20.244 --> 03:30:23.305]  Oh wait, four of them had heart attacks, and then one of them is still alive.
[03:30:23.325 --> 03:30:27.166]  None of them even died on that day, and they still hold mock funerals for them every year.
[03:30:27.186 --> 03:30:29.487]  I mean, this is the sickness that we're dealing with.
[03:30:31.337 --> 03:30:35.820]  I can't think of anybody on the left that's been killed by the right wing.
[03:30:35.900 --> 03:30:47.507]  And look, we should have realized this and treated this as seriously with John Hodgkins, or whatever his name was, who shot up the softball field.
[03:30:47.887 --> 03:30:51.209]  Remember, if he had been successful in his attack, that's like
[03:30:51.789 --> 03:30:55.432]  That was like five members of the GOP Senate that would have been wiped out.
[03:30:55.572 --> 03:30:57.253]  It would have been politically devastating.
[03:30:57.313 --> 03:30:59.294]  It would have been obviously a horrific massacre.
[03:30:59.314 --> 03:31:00.515]  So I found his Instagram account.
[03:31:00.935 --> 03:31:02.056]  It is private.
[03:31:02.316 --> 03:31:03.957]  He's got 3,700 followers.
[03:31:03.997 --> 03:31:05.338]  He's following 68 accounts.
[03:31:06.259 --> 03:31:09.561]  And he's got black flags in his bio that says 1,601.
[03:31:10.101 --> 03:31:11.402]  I don't know what that means. 16,001?
[03:31:15.686 --> 03:31:16.806]  And it says anti-fascist.
[03:31:17.086 --> 03:31:17.786]  Schizophrenic language.
[03:31:17.806 --> 03:31:21.167]  And he said, at skvmlord made me do it.
[03:31:21.507 --> 03:31:24.768]  It's at skvmlord.
[03:31:25.388 --> 03:31:26.688]  And I don't know who that is or what it is.
[03:31:26.748 --> 03:31:27.288]  Skumlord.
[03:31:27.308 --> 03:31:28.369]  I don't know.
[03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.989]  It's bizarre.
[03:31:29.209 --> 03:31:29.989]  This is his account.
[03:31:30.449 --> 03:31:35.170]  But since his account's private, I don't believe I can look at who he follows.
[03:31:35.190 --> 03:31:36.050]  He's got a profile picture.
[03:31:36.070 --> 03:31:37.511]  It looks like him with shorter hair.
[03:31:37.711 --> 03:31:38.691]  I think this is him.
[03:31:38.831 --> 03:31:39.511]  Let's be careful.
[03:31:39.571 --> 03:31:41.611]  Let's think this is him.
[03:31:41.651 --> 03:31:42.112]  I'm not sure.
[03:31:44.312 --> 03:31:53.140]  Before we go to air with that, because this is, you know, like Alex said, when he first came on, you know, the mainstream media will report something, we'll report it, they'll get it wrong, and then we'll get blamed for it.
[03:31:53.160 --> 03:31:55.122]  So, we have to be extra careful here.
[03:31:55.922 --> 03:31:58.384]  Let's go to some of these videos that I've been putting in.
[03:31:58.404 --> 03:32:04.350]  I put in several, if the crew can tell me if they've pulled those in yet.
[03:32:05.171 --> 03:32:09.013]  We have one, uh, I Can't Believe This Is Real, CNN Criticizes Trump.
[03:32:09.053 --> 03:32:14.776]  We can go to that to see them actually criticize him for saying, fight, fight, fight, literally seconds after being shot in the face.
[03:32:15.237 --> 03:32:28.284]  We have another witness, uh, to the shooting, talking about, and this one sounds even crazier, where it sounds like they're, they're running to the authorities to tell the guy, in fact, if the crew can tell me, do you guys have these videos?
[03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:32.891]  We have a witness to the shooting at Donald Trump's rally.
[03:32:32.931 --> 03:32:33.572]  Let's go to that now.
[03:32:33.592 --> 03:32:35.733]  We showed one before, the five-minute one.
[03:32:36.033 --> 03:32:37.114]  This is a one-minute video.
[03:32:37.194 --> 03:32:39.696]  A different witness to the shooting saying the same story.
[03:32:39.736 --> 03:32:42.578]  They saw the shooter, tried to alert authorities, and nothing was done.
[03:32:42.638 --> 03:32:43.078]  Let's watch.
[03:32:43.759 --> 03:32:44.839]  Just take me back.
[03:32:45.680 --> 03:32:48.942]  What were you doing before the shooting happened, and then what did you see and hear?
[03:32:48.962 --> 03:32:53.965]  I was just hanging, standing there like everybody else, waiting for Trump.
[03:32:55.785 --> 03:33:02.028]  We, as Trump started, I noticed two officers that were looking for something or somebody.
[03:33:02.048 --> 03:33:14.954]  So I was looking around myself and seeing a guy on top of one of the buildings go in between one building to the next and went and told the officer that he was up there.
[03:33:16.074 --> 03:33:22.998]  And when I went back to my spot, I heard that people could still see the person from where they were standing.
[03:33:23.238 --> 03:33:30.123]  So I checked that out, and I went back to tell the officer that if he came over there, he could see them.
[03:33:31.123 --> 03:33:38.567]  And when I turned my back is when the shots started, and then it took me a second or two to figure out exactly what it was.
[03:33:39.668 --> 03:33:54.215]  And then it was just getting out of there and helping, helping some, some other person out with her child and we got out and that was, that was the end of that and I went and left and that was all.
[03:33:55.976 --> 03:33:56.236]  Wow.
[03:33:57.056 --> 03:33:57.977]  There you go, another eyewitness.
[03:33:58.410 --> 03:34:01.371]  Truly a horrific and sad moment for the country.
[03:34:01.931 --> 03:34:10.493]  Of course, no information on this individual is confirmed because, well, the mainstream media has not seen fit to print any information about this individual.
[03:34:10.733 --> 03:34:16.494]  Like, in this New York Post article, we don't really have a clear photo of the guy other than the fact that he's dead.
[03:34:16.514 --> 03:34:17.094]  Yeah.
[03:34:17.534 --> 03:34:21.215]  And I'm sure, you know, I'm sure it'll be very hard for the real details to come out.
[03:34:22.145 --> 03:34:31.077]  What's very shameful about all of this is that inevitably, as we've already touched on, as other people on Twitter have already said themselves,
[03:34:32.478 --> 03:34:34.779]  We shouldn't overreact to this.
[03:34:35.039 --> 03:34:35.319]  Right.
[03:34:35.839 --> 03:34:37.540]  We need to be careful.
[03:34:37.580 --> 03:34:38.880]  We need to watch what we say.
[03:34:39.160 --> 03:34:43.021]  And these are the same people that like the Snoop Dogg video where he points the gun at Trump.
[03:34:43.381 --> 03:34:44.882]  And what's her name?
[03:34:45.122 --> 03:34:45.422]  I forget.
[03:34:45.442 --> 03:34:46.062]  Kathy Griffin.
[03:34:46.142 --> 03:34:46.722]  Kathy Griffin.
[03:34:46.762 --> 03:34:48.983]  Very unrememberable individual.
[03:34:49.043 --> 03:34:51.904]  Very ugly old lady holding up the severed head.
[03:34:52.304 --> 03:34:56.305]  This has been pre-programmed for literally the better part of a decade now.
[03:34:56.565 --> 03:35:01.187]  They hate this guy and they've always hated this guy since he decided to make this push to be pro-America.
[03:35:01.727 --> 03:35:04.448]  And it's because they know that he's the only one that can destroy him.
[03:35:04.708 --> 03:35:06.869]  And perhaps we didn't even really realize that at first.
[03:35:07.249 --> 03:35:11.510]  Perhaps we looked at this guy and said, oh, he's funny, he's interesting, he's making a lot of good points, he wants to close the border.
[03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:14.251]  That's how it all started when he came down the escalator.
[03:35:15.091 --> 03:35:18.292]  Now, we're not in Kansas anymore, as Alex likes to say.
[03:35:18.893 --> 03:35:19.933]  We're firmly in
[03:35:21.567 --> 03:35:23.569]  We're on the path to the Wicked Witch of the West.
[03:35:23.589 --> 03:35:24.029]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:35:24.369 --> 03:35:29.894]  Well, and, you know, they still deny that MTV even exists, right?
[03:35:29.934 --> 03:35:33.536]  They refuse to acknowledge, and this is the thing.
[03:35:34.437 --> 03:35:47.047]  If you take, if you just look at everything they've done over the past few months, really in just the past few months, because you can go back years, obviously, they've been doing this for a very, very long time, but it's been uncovered through America First Legal.
[03:35:48.456 --> 03:35:53.220]  Well, before I say that, it was testified to.
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:36:04.768]  Trump's lawyer, his White House counsel, said he refused to investigate election fraud because he thought if he discovered fraud and if they overturned the election, then the left would burn down cities.
[03:36:05.048 --> 03:36:06.830]  That was his testimony under oath.
[03:36:06.890 --> 03:36:09.231]  He said that's why he didn't want to investigate voter fraud.
[03:36:09.251 --> 03:36:15.196]  He said it was a losing proposition because if he were to prove fraud and overturn the election, then the left would get violent.
[03:36:17.097 --> 03:36:20.219]  Oh, the FBI has a statement about this that we can go to here.
[03:36:20.259 --> 03:36:22.300]  Okay, this is the FBI statement.
[03:36:22.320 --> 03:36:22.720]  Let's watch.
[03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:24.581]  My name is Kevin Rojek.
[03:36:25.581 --> 03:36:26.842]  That's R-O-J-E-K.
[03:36:27.663 --> 03:36:31.424]  I'm the special agent in charge of the FBI Pittsburgh field office.
[03:36:33.165 --> 03:36:45.912]  The first thing I want to say is that the FBI stands with the people of Butler County in Western Pennsylvania, and our hearts go out to the victims of this heinous act which occurred today.
[03:36:47.102 --> 03:37:14.783]  This is our community, and I want to let the public know that the FBI has deployed a number of our resources, including investigative agents, our evidence response team, bomb technicians, and we have additional resources coming from other field offices, as well as from FBI headquarters, including our evidence response from Quantico Virginia.
[03:37:18.607 --> 03:37:30.591]  We have intelligence analysts as well, working from our field office in Pittsburgh, working feverishly to attempt to identify the individual who did this and any motives behind why this was done.
[03:37:32.692 --> 03:37:34.072]  Right now, we need the public's help.
[03:37:35.293 --> 03:37:45.036]  Anyone who was on scene, who saw anything, who identified any information, please report that to the FBI using either the phone number 1-800-CALL-FBI or online
[03:37:52.618 --> 03:38:01.944]  This evening we had what we're calling an assassination attempt against our former president, Donald Trump.
[03:38:03.765 --> 03:38:05.146]  It's still an active crime scene.
[03:38:05.786 --> 03:38:08.168]  As I mentioned, we have a number of agents on scene.
[03:38:09.069 --> 03:38:16.594]  We also are working closely with other federal agencies, our state partners, and our local police partners as well.
[03:38:18.320 --> 03:38:22.543]  Again, at this time, we are not prepared to identify who the shooter is.
[03:38:23.804 --> 03:38:31.548]  We are close to that identification, and as soon as we are 100% confident in who that individual is, we will share it with the press.
[03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:46.198]  With that being said, also, we do not currently have an identified motive, although our investigators are working tirelessly to attempt to identify what that motive was.
[03:38:47.605 --> 03:38:54.593]  Yeah, I think it was probably the same motive that the FBI had when it was launching fake investigations trying to destroy Donald Trump's presidency.
[03:38:54.613 --> 03:38:56.835]  It was probably that same motivation.
[03:38:56.935 --> 03:39:00.940]  You wonder what their motive, what the FBI's motivation is now.
[03:39:01.601 --> 03:39:08.288]  I'm gonna stop flushing the toilets at my house when I take a dump, and I'm gonna say, I'm not gonna call that a crap.
[03:39:08.689 --> 03:39:08.909]  Yeah.
[03:39:09.109 --> 03:39:11.732]  I'm not calling that a poo, it's not that.
[03:39:12.032 --> 03:39:14.134]  We gotta do an investigation into this, you know?
[03:39:14.655 --> 03:39:22.103]  I mean, just the flavor that's already amassed after this event is putrid, these people.
[03:39:23.584 --> 03:39:50.553]  Yeah, and look, you know, the other thing I was gonna say, the America First legal case came out where the heads of the entire intelligence agencies, basically, Clapper and Brennan, all these guys, were caught, in their own words, getting trusted media outlets and trusted influencers to spread the narrative that Trump supporters were the domestic terrorists in this country in order to get the, you know,
[03:39:51.193 --> 03:39:55.455]  In order to create the political will to get them more power to go after Trump supporters.
[03:39:56.916 --> 03:39:59.237]  Antifa actually is a threat to this country.
[03:39:59.337 --> 03:40:04.560]  They actually are holding our nation in hostage at this point.
[03:40:04.780 --> 03:40:06.121]  They're holding us hostage.
[03:40:06.141 --> 03:40:17.567]  When you have the lead White House counsel saying we did not investigate voter fraud because we were afraid that if it was uncovered that Antifa would burn down cities in this country.
[03:40:18.107 --> 03:40:19.388]  So the radical left
[03:40:20.328 --> 03:40:29.255]  Literally has a gun to America's head and the people in power who are in cahoots with them and are covering up for them and say they don't exist are in fact
[03:40:30.729 --> 03:40:37.352]  Relying on them as the threat saying, well, we have to basically destroy Trump or else the left is going to burn everything down.
[03:40:38.033 --> 03:40:46.177]  The exact, that same level of insanity from the left going after Trump supporters has to be turned on the left.
[03:40:46.317 --> 03:40:48.198]  We have to have that same attitude.
[03:40:48.618 --> 03:40:49.638]  Not where we're fabricating.
[03:40:49.658 --> 03:40:50.759]  We don't have to fabricate things.
[03:40:50.779 --> 03:40:52.900]  They have to fabricate things because they don't actually have any proof.
[03:40:53.420 --> 03:40:54.001]  We're good to go.
[03:41:17.458 --> 03:41:24.433]  A massive and continuous threat that is completely ignored and actually covered up for by the authorities.
[03:41:25.394 --> 03:41:27.379]  We're in such a crazy situation right now.
[03:41:27.754 --> 03:41:38.157]  I mean, if you look at things that have happened here locally in Austin, Texas with Antifa, there was that incident, I think he was recently pardoned by Governor Abbott, but you remember the Garrett Foster incident, correct?
[03:41:38.177 --> 03:41:38.777]  Of course.
[03:41:38.797 --> 03:41:51.842]  Alright, so you've got a dude who thinks it's a good idea to take his quadriplegic girlfriend, who's in a wheelchair, she doesn't have any arms or legs, to wheel her out during a street takeover while wearing his AK-47 on a body strap
[03:41:53.522 --> 03:41:57.943]  And then he thinks it's an even better idea to go walk up on somebody's car and raise his weapon.
[03:41:58.503 --> 03:42:01.484]  And then that guy gets sentenced and gets convicted.
[03:42:01.644 --> 03:42:01.824]  Yep.
[03:42:02.324 --> 03:42:06.645]  We're living in a world where these people, literally, it's said all the time.
[03:42:06.665 --> 03:42:07.565]  Like a license to kill.
[03:42:07.885 --> 03:42:10.945]  License to kill, rights for me but not for thee.
[03:42:11.506 --> 03:42:16.687]  And that's not just for the elected officials, it's for the dominant underclass too.
[03:42:16.747 --> 03:42:18.867]  The mob in ancient Rome was very useful.
[03:42:19.147 --> 03:42:21.209]  There's a reason why the mafia is referred to as the mob.
[03:42:21.549 --> 03:42:29.097]  The mob was a very useful tool to scare the populace into accepting coercion and control.
[03:42:29.658 --> 03:42:36.765]  And a very important part of the mob is not just the violence, but it's also the political subterfuge and the destruction of people like the senator's identities.
[03:42:37.125 --> 03:42:38.825]  That was a big part of what the mob was.
[03:42:39.126 --> 03:42:42.306]  It wasn't just a physical force arm, it was also a disinformation arm.
[03:42:42.646 --> 03:42:51.629]  It was a large, but still a minority, of the underclass of the population that they controlled, and they were able to use them not just for physical violence, but also for mental games.
[03:42:51.789 --> 03:42:51.989]  Yeah.
[03:42:52.349 --> 03:42:53.169]  That's what we're living in now.
[03:42:53.449 --> 03:42:57.390]  We have to refer back to ancient Rome, we have to look back at ancient times where things like this have happened.
[03:42:57.591 --> 03:42:57.791]  Yeah.
[03:42:58.671 --> 03:42:59.371]  No, you're exactly right.
[03:42:59.391 --> 03:43:01.472]  That is an extremely good point.
[03:43:02.172 --> 03:43:02.892]  You're exactly right.
[03:43:04.113 --> 03:43:06.035]  And look, it's what they're doing.
[03:43:06.095 --> 03:43:12.522]  They are using Antifa as an enforcement arm of their policies.
[03:43:12.782 --> 03:43:17.387]  And it's not just that they know that they can get away with it.
[03:43:18.487 --> 03:43:31.600]  They have like the numbers of lawyers written on their arms so that when they get arrested, they know they can call somebody who Kamala Harris and all of her billionaire friends have donated millions of dollars to fund their legal fight.
[03:43:31.921 --> 03:43:34.023]  They know that the judges will let them out.
[03:43:34.123 --> 03:43:35.124]  I mean, it's rigged.
[03:43:35.344 --> 03:43:36.425]  The whole system is rigged for that.
[03:43:36.425 --> 03:43:37.465]  We're the resistance!
[03:43:37.526 --> 03:43:38.946]  We're the resistance fighters!
[03:43:38.986 --> 03:43:40.007]  We're the freedom fighters!
[03:43:40.107 --> 03:43:43.909]  Literally subsidized by hundreds of millions of dollars from Soros and other people.
[03:43:43.989 --> 03:43:46.210]  It's just, it's so laughable.
[03:43:46.430 --> 03:43:50.192]  And like, what a beautifully sick, evil idea of the devil.
[03:43:50.512 --> 03:43:53.493]  To call yourself anti-fascist and to in fact be a Nazi.
[03:43:53.813 --> 03:43:54.414]  Like, that's the thing.
[03:43:54.454 --> 03:43:55.274]  I'm gonna touch on it again.
[03:43:55.534 --> 03:43:57.195]  We have to call these people what they are.
[03:43:57.535 --> 03:44:08.508]  They are hostile, authoritarian, political actors, and in my book, and in the common American nomenclature, which is even more important for the average person to understand, this is what a Nazi looks like.
[03:44:09.028 --> 03:44:11.391]  A Nazi doesn't look like, like what?
[03:44:11.791 --> 03:44:15.575]  Are there maybe like a thousand Klan members in America or something like that?
[03:44:15.796 --> 03:44:16.697]  Some ridiculous number.
[03:44:16.957 --> 03:44:24.061]  Well they point to that and they go, oh that's the evil right wingers when there's literally hundreds of thousands of these like mobbed up children is what they are.
[03:44:24.141 --> 03:44:25.181]  We could all take three of them.
[03:44:26.082 --> 03:44:33.826]  They got hundreds of thousands of these just looney tunes on the streets begging for other people to have their guns taken away, but they want to be the enforcers in the commune.
[03:44:34.066 --> 03:44:34.206]  Yeah.
[03:44:34.426 --> 03:44:40.230]  I mean, I used to hang out, because I wanted to see girls and stuff, a while ago, at the 21st Street Co-op on West Campus.
[03:44:40.590 --> 03:44:47.475]  And I talked to some of these Looney Tunes, and one of them goes, of course there's a fat white woman I'm talking about, about 5'3", maybe 270.
[03:44:47.795 --> 03:44:50.677]  She goes, oh, I'm an indigenous socialist.
[03:44:50.757 --> 03:44:53.018]  And I go, oh, what does that mean?
[03:44:53.239 --> 03:44:59.683]  And she goes, oh, well, you know, the white man in America's fucked up the, excuse my language, sorry, put a bleep on that.
[03:45:00.023 --> 03:45:09.253]  America screwed up the world so bad that we have to return authority to the true leaders who can heal the world like they're some kind of shamans because they literally are.
[03:45:09.533 --> 03:45:14.058]  We have to give power to the Central and South American tribes to take over America.
[03:45:14.379 --> 03:45:19.544]  And this is a girl that's in her third year of studies about to get her bachelor's in like political science.
[03:45:19.704 --> 03:45:19.885]  Yeah.
[03:45:22.594 --> 03:45:24.215]  My toe has more knowledge.
[03:45:25.756 --> 03:45:29.237]  But these are the people that are pumped up on social media.
[03:45:29.297 --> 03:45:34.740]  These are the people that are slightly smarter than the dummies that they use to actually carry out the mass murder and evil deeds.
[03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:41.063]  These are the people that create this kind of social safety blanket to tell others that it's okay to fall even deeper.
[03:45:41.465 --> 03:45:51.631]  Well, and they're all on, you know, some bizarre mix of SSRIs and, you know, things that just literally deaden them to the rest of humanity.
[03:45:51.771 --> 03:45:56.714]  She was on, she was big Chungus mode, so I assume there was some, probably some Seroquel or something like that involved some Prozac.
[03:45:56.954 --> 03:45:59.015]  Yeah, and I bet this shooter was on something too.
[03:45:59.135 --> 03:46:01.356]  I'd be willing to bet good money on that.
[03:46:02.037 --> 03:46:09.241]  We're still waiting on more information from him, but I mean, everybody's sort of pointing out the same stuff that we have been.
[03:46:09.741 --> 03:46:18.646]  The fact that they've been, they were openly calling for Trump's assassination just weeks ago when the Supreme Court decided that yes, the President does have
[03:46:19.506 --> 03:46:24.131]  Certain privileges that not everyone else has that he can't be tried for.
[03:46:24.171 --> 03:46:24.532]  Can't show.
[03:46:24.792 --> 03:46:25.533]  It's not possible.
[03:46:25.553 --> 03:46:25.793]  Yeah.
[03:46:26.354 --> 03:46:34.103]  A lot of people, I mean, more and more people questioning how Secret Service could have gotten it this bad.
[03:46:34.984 --> 03:46:36.065]  Could have gotten it this wrong.
[03:46:36.465 --> 03:46:45.333]  Maybe we're all just, like, fat and lessened in America to the point of where, like, the reaction time collectively has slowed down, even for our best people, for it to get this bad.
[03:46:45.674 --> 03:46:47.856]  Like, I'm not saying anything sketchy had to happen.
[03:46:47.876 --> 03:46:53.060]  Maybe we're all just, like, dumb oafs, and in that case, I pray that China doesn't take us over overnight.
[03:46:53.621 --> 03:46:55.162]  Chase, you've been deep in the digital world.
[03:46:55.182 --> 03:47:00.047]  Have you seen any kind of, like, liberal publications publish any articles, any smear pieces against President Trump?
[03:47:02.913 --> 03:47:21.231]  Every day but I've been looking at the news tonight because I've just been following this rabbit hole on Instagram because the account that I was looking at earlier linked to other accounts and those other accounts linked to other accounts but all of their bios changed and they removed all the hyperlinks and it's just it's a web I'm not going to get into it but
[03:47:21.531 --> 03:47:24.634]  Of course, nothing's confirmed, but it sounds like you may have found something pretty interesting.
[03:47:24.654 --> 03:47:31.420]  It seems like this guy was a local Antifa guy, and he was involved with a group of others.
[03:47:31.460 --> 03:47:32.701]  Antifa activities.
[03:47:32.741 --> 03:47:37.905]  I'm not saying anybody else put him up to it, literally, but this looks to be a left-wing radical.
[03:47:43.610 --> 03:47:56.582]  You know, thoughts earlier today that any of you might have had or that I had regarding whether or not they were going to try to blame this on a right-wing radical or right-wing extremist or a disgruntled right-winger seem not to be the case.
[03:47:56.863 --> 03:48:02.148]  It seems based on the digging that I've done and this is all just so new and so everything take with a grain of salt.
[03:48:02.568 --> 03:48:07.653]  It seems that this might have been a radical Antifa activist that was involved in the shooting, but we'll learn more in the days to come.
[03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:09.513]  Well, I'm not surprised by that at all.
[03:48:09.553 --> 03:48:11.276]  And again, we just need to treat it in the same way.
[03:48:12.377 --> 03:48:16.204]  How would the Democrats be treating this if a right-winger shot Joe Biden?
[03:48:16.244 --> 03:48:16.765]  God forbid.
[03:48:17.631 --> 03:48:20.812]  It would not be well, you know, there would already be there's crazy people.
[03:48:20.832 --> 03:48:26.873]  There already be like laws on the books, you know, they already be passing laws to like into freedom of speech.
[03:48:26.893 --> 03:48:27.233]  You know what?
[03:48:27.833 --> 03:48:28.213]  You know what?
[03:48:28.253 --> 03:48:33.594]  You know Antifa all always said over and over again that we are not an organization.
[03:48:33.654 --> 03:48:35.274]  It's an idea and Antifa is an organization.
[03:48:35.294 --> 03:48:35.554]  It's an idea.
[03:48:35.574 --> 03:48:38.035]  Everyone's like, why are you saying that it's not an organization?
[03:48:38.455 --> 03:48:43.256]  And the obvious reason is because they don't want to get recode because if if
[03:48:43.416 --> 03:48:43.696]  Let's go!
[03:49:13.556 --> 03:49:13.856]  Yeah.
[03:49:14.296 --> 03:49:21.959]  Well, apparently the mob never figured out, you can just say, but we're not a group, and apparently you can't be tried on a refund charge.
[03:49:22.539 --> 03:49:23.419]  Who cares what they say?
[03:49:23.459 --> 03:49:24.440]  They're clearly organized.
[03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:26.880]  Well, I want to speak on that just a little bit.
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:37.804]  Any other group, whether it be, if Patriot Front, let's take for an example, that on the right, if that was actually real and not just a clear FBI glowy project, if that was an actual real thing,
[03:49:38.704 --> 03:49:45.071]  Even if they said, oh, we're decentralized, whatever, the government would bulldoze that over in five seconds.
[03:49:45.091 --> 03:49:45.772]  But not Antifa.
[03:49:45.872 --> 03:49:46.472]  Not Antifa.
[03:49:46.492 --> 03:49:48.735]  They've chosen not to do that because they're useful.
[03:49:49.095 --> 03:49:50.957]  And that's the thing.
[03:49:50.977 --> 03:50:00.807]  198 United States Congress people, all Democrats, voted against a law that would make it a requirement for you to be a citizen to vote.
[03:50:01.348 --> 03:50:01.688]  All right?
[03:50:02.729 --> 03:50:03.970]  It's takeover time.
[03:50:04.190 --> 03:50:05.711]  Like, do the takeover dance.
[03:50:05.771 --> 03:50:07.072]  Like, it's takeover time.
[03:50:07.412 --> 03:50:08.373]  It's happening now.
[03:50:08.673 --> 03:50:09.954]  You can't deny it anymore.
[03:50:10.314 --> 03:50:12.975]  And everyone's like, oh, we still need to control our language.
[03:50:13.456 --> 03:50:15.437]  No, no, no.
[03:50:15.497 --> 03:50:17.018]  We have to speak truth to power.
[03:50:17.038 --> 03:50:17.699]  We have to be real.
[03:50:17.759 --> 03:50:18.359]  It's takeover time.
[03:50:18.638 --> 03:50:18.818]  Yeah.
[03:50:19.599 --> 03:50:24.143]  This is from Chris Martinson on X. I thought this was a pretty good rundown.
[03:50:24.183 --> 03:50:39.417]  He says, there's a second video, a video of a second guy who also saw the shooter, that's the video we just showed you, went and told officers, then went to a different vantage point, could still see the dude, went back to officers to bring them to where he could also, but maybe see the shooter, and then the shots rang out.
[03:50:40.117 --> 03:50:41.377]  So now the story as we have it.
[03:50:41.617 --> 03:50:53.080]  One, at least two ordinary citizens saw the shooter guy crawling on the roof with a long gun and audibly alerted nearby LEOs and Secret Service, but all the trained LEOs and Secret Service folks somehow missed seeing this guy.
[03:50:53.641 --> 03:50:59.002]  Two, the shooter was spotted and reported by these citizens at least two minutes before the shooting began.
[03:50:59.522 --> 03:51:05.884]  Plenty of time for alerted LEO to have at least radioed about a threat on the roof, even if they keystone-copped checking it out.
[03:51:06.604 --> 03:51:13.970]  Three, at least two trained LEO snipers were glassing that exact roof in the time before the shooting began, but did not fire for some reason.
[03:51:14.470 --> 03:51:20.695]  Four, they only fired after shots were fired did return fire happen.
[03:51:21.195 --> 03:51:28.121]  Five, for some reason that roof was not occupied by LEO or SS, as would be SOP in any other circumstances.
[03:51:28.321 --> 03:51:30.262]  Further, no drones were in operation apparently.
[03:51:30.723 --> 03:51:33.765]  Well, that chain of events certainly stinks to high heaven, so.
[03:51:34.146 --> 03:51:39.005]  Can we get an overhead shot of this New York Post article with the three guys standing over the dead body?
[03:51:39.025 --> 03:51:39.748]  I'll open it here.
[03:51:42.648 --> 03:51:42.908]  All right.
[03:51:43.508 --> 03:51:50.070]  Forget about the two dudes that are in fatigues, Navy SEAL mode, whatever mode, Army Ranger mode, that they're standing over the body.
[03:51:50.811 --> 03:52:00.274]  The slightly portly middle-aged cop on TRT with the AR-15 standing behind, he could have climbed up that ladder in two minutes and investigated himself.
[03:52:00.614 --> 03:52:03.395]  But we don't, we can't have something that good happen.
[03:52:03.695 --> 03:52:04.255]  Right.
[03:52:04.295 --> 03:52:05.215]  We can't, we can't have that.
[03:52:05.235 --> 03:52:09.517]  It has to get to the point where the president gets shot millimeters away from being dead.
[03:52:10.337 --> 03:52:16.341]  And you look at that and you say, that's our failure, that's sad that we didn't protect him, oh maybe something screwy is going on here.
[03:52:17.262 --> 03:52:18.342]  We have to fall on God.
[03:52:18.603 --> 03:52:19.603]  I'm just gonna keep saying it.
[03:52:19.623 --> 03:52:32.292]  We have to praise God that through all these misfortunate events of them not seeing the shooter, of them not responding in time, and things not happening in the correct way they're supposed to, a secret service saving the day, it still didn't work in the enemy's favor.
[03:52:33.052 --> 03:52:33.773]  Still didn't happen.
[03:52:34.373 --> 03:52:34.954]  That's because of God.
[03:52:35.794 --> 03:52:36.675]  That's all I have to say.
[03:52:36.715 --> 03:52:37.917]  That's why I wanted the overhead shot.
[03:52:38.418 --> 03:52:39.158]  Yeah.
[03:52:39.199 --> 03:52:40.841]  Repeatedly trying to holster her own weapon.
[03:52:47.853 --> 03:52:55.296]  Leader of Secret Service is a woman who is made a point to get female officers on the force.
[03:52:55.596 --> 03:52:57.536]  But I watch Captain Marvel and she flies around.
[03:52:58.217 --> 03:52:59.577]  So she can do that too.
[03:53:00.017 --> 03:53:00.777]  Apparently so.
[03:53:01.018 --> 03:53:05.979]  Apparently so as people are posting this image of a Secret Service agent unable to holster her weapon.
[03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:10.881]  Another one seems to be fiddling with her glasses for a bit.
[03:53:12.537 --> 03:53:14.178]  But yeah, total failure here.
[03:53:14.278 --> 03:53:17.179]  Total failure on the Secret Services part.
[03:53:18.079 --> 03:53:25.003]  And, by the way, we have another, we have a couple more videos that I would like to go to.
[03:53:26.863 --> 03:53:30.225]  Let's go to, this one says, I can't believe this is real.
[03:53:30.325 --> 03:53:31.946]  CNN criticizes Trump.
[03:53:32.666 --> 03:53:33.626]  I can't believe this is real.
[03:53:33.646 --> 03:53:34.627]  Let's go to that CNN clip.
[03:53:36.414 --> 03:53:44.981]  I do want to say there was one thing that when I watched the tape, I found odd because of all of the heated rhetoric.
[03:53:45.441 --> 03:53:53.287]  And that is that after he was hit, former President Trump got up and said, fight, fight, fight.
[03:53:53.787 --> 03:54:00.332]  I think what we're hearing from people is that's not the message that we want to be sending right now.
[03:54:00.372 --> 03:54:01.593]  We want to tamp it down.
[03:54:01.613 --> 03:54:05.196]  I would just note one thing on this, kind of to that point.
[03:54:07.273 --> 03:54:08.275]  Yeah, okay.
[03:54:08.615 --> 03:54:09.016]  Great.
[03:54:10.097 --> 03:54:11.459]  We have to focus on his language.
[03:54:11.860 --> 03:54:13.002]  Yeah, it's his language.
[03:54:13.242 --> 03:54:14.764]  When you get shot in the head by a, uh...
[03:54:16.497 --> 03:54:18.738]  Radical, militant, political figure.
[03:54:19.658 --> 03:54:20.958]  Just be polite about it, okay?
[03:54:20.998 --> 03:54:21.338]  Won't you?
[03:54:21.518 --> 03:54:22.419]  Yeah, grow up, right?
[03:54:22.839 --> 03:54:23.959]  It's time to grow up soon.
[03:54:24.219 --> 03:54:30.081]  I mean, legally, I don't know what the laws are in Pennsylvania, but I imagine legally Trump would have been able to shoot the guy back.
[03:54:30.181 --> 03:54:30.661]  You would think so.
[03:54:30.681 --> 03:54:34.302]  So saying fight was not even illegal in whatever context.
[03:54:34.322 --> 03:54:37.403]  Well, it promotes violence and we don't want to promote violence.
[03:54:37.463 --> 03:54:38.703]  We want to roll over and die.
[03:54:38.723 --> 03:54:42.544]  I think violence maybe promoted violence in this particular instance.
[03:54:43.669 --> 03:54:44.569]  Don't say that, that's hateful.
[03:54:44.609 --> 03:54:50.050]  Yeah, they just came out with a movie called Civil War where they assassinated Donald Trump, but Donald Trump's the one promoting violence.
[03:54:50.270 --> 03:54:51.091]  Wonderful.
[03:54:51.111 --> 03:54:51.911]  Yeah, we'll go to that.
[03:54:52.291 --> 03:54:56.852]  We'll go to a Hollywood compilation here in just a second, but before we go to that, I want to play another one.
[03:54:56.872 --> 03:54:59.132]  This is called I'm in the Center of Times Square.
[03:54:59.152 --> 03:55:00.373]  You guys have that one?
[03:55:01.353 --> 03:55:04.353]  Alright, we'll pull that one in.
[03:55:04.373 --> 03:55:11.015]  I can't remember who posted this, but it's a well-known... Simone Gold, Dr. Simone Gold is in Times Square.
[03:55:12.065 --> 03:55:24.331]  Hours after the assassination and not a single screen in Times Square is saying anything about the assassination, which typically there's like news stations on Times Square that is just playing videos.
[03:55:25.592 --> 03:55:27.233]  Nothing about this though.
[03:55:27.753 --> 03:55:33.716]  So if you were in Times Square like as a tourist and haven't looked at your phone, you had no idea this was happening hours after it happened.
[03:55:34.127 --> 03:55:40.692]  Well, and if you look at CNN, the way they talked about this versus post-debate, they jumped on Biden's butt post-debate, like instantly.
[03:55:40.752 --> 03:55:42.914]  Two minutes, I was here because I'm just a fan of the show.
[03:55:42.954 --> 03:55:47.678]  And it's like, I get to be the best fan of the show because I can come watch in person basically whenever I want.
[03:55:48.138 --> 03:55:51.241]  So I'm sitting back there and I'm watching the live broadcast, watching y'all cover it.
[03:55:51.941 --> 03:55:56.765]  And they instantly jumped on Biden's butt, but now it's complete, you know, deep state.
[03:55:56.845 --> 03:56:03.992]  It's kind of a soulless language that you kind of hear and you can recognize after, like, decades, like all of us, of kind of being around all of this.
[03:56:04.592 --> 03:56:14.581]  Well, we must make sure that the calls for violence from President Trump are not followed out and we must fight against all kinds of violent rhetoric.
[03:56:14.881 --> 03:56:19.185]  Not once talking, saying, hey, he's been, there's been an assassination attempt.
[03:56:19.645 --> 03:56:23.207]  That's what the news is supposed to do, but instead it's the soulless language.
[03:56:23.247 --> 03:56:26.709]  But what the Biden thing was, this guy, Democratic Party's got to pull him out!
[03:56:27.370 --> 03:56:34.854]  So you just, you hear the language switch, and once you learn to recognize that you can't really stop, you can tell when kind of the Borg is taking control.
[03:56:35.174 --> 03:56:35.394]  Yeah.
[03:56:35.594 --> 03:56:40.577]  And you know, just while we run these clips, let's give out the numbers so we can let the crew screen some of these calls.
[03:56:40.777 --> 03:56:40.997]  That's 877-789-2539.
[03:56:41.017 --> 03:56:41.057]  877-789-2539.
[03:56:41.077 --> 03:56:42.458]  And then we'll let the crew screen some calls and as we
[03:56:49.382 --> 03:56:50.364]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[03:56:50.904 --> 03:56:52.446]  I think I'm going to have to get out of here.
[03:56:52.566 --> 03:56:54.889]  I've been up since 6 this morning.
[03:56:55.129 --> 03:56:56.490]  I'm starting to fade.
[03:56:56.531 --> 03:56:59.934]  You guys are going to be here and taking calls for the time being.
[03:57:00.575 --> 03:57:03.719]  I do want to remind you just how important it is that InfoWars be on the air.
[03:57:04.219 --> 03:57:09.561]  Right now be able to give voice to some of these things that you are just literally not getting on mainstream media.
[03:57:09.741 --> 03:57:12.681]  It's nobody else is showing you these images.
[03:57:12.761 --> 03:57:18.003]  Nobody else is covering some of the speculation about Secret Service and everything else.
[03:57:18.063 --> 03:57:28.406]  InfoWars is a vital component to winning this real-life war that we are seeing explode in real very real fashion today and
[03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:36.477]  The fact that we, that this whole crew has come in and, you know, there's no twisting of the arm.
[03:57:36.517 --> 03:57:39.880]  It was like everybody at InfoWars, as soon as this happened, realized like, we gotta go.
[03:57:39.900 --> 03:57:40.881]  We gotta get live.
[03:57:41.422 --> 03:57:42.363]  We gotta be on the air.
[03:57:42.883 --> 03:57:43.584]  And there is such a...
[03:57:44.853 --> 03:57:48.716]  Important value in doing this from a studio with the crew that could be pulling stuff up.
[03:57:48.736 --> 03:57:49.976]  We'll be taking your phone calls.
[03:57:50.037 --> 03:57:54.459]  I see the screen is already full of calls, so we'll be able to hear from all of you.
[03:57:54.560 --> 03:57:58.202]  There is such a great value in having a central location.
[03:57:58.802 --> 03:58:08.749]  You know, you can just think of every one of us here, all the crew members, all the hosts, all the writers, all the... We could all be our own little dinky rowboat, or we could all have a role to play on a battleship.
[03:58:08.809 --> 03:58:09.990]  And this is the battleship.
[03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:11.431]  And it's so important.
[03:58:11.471 --> 03:58:14.073]  I was doing an interview, a podcast appearance.
[03:58:15.293 --> 03:58:27.617]  And they, when they were introducing me, and this isn't to blow, you know, toot my own horn or anything, but it's true, they were saying, they were like, well, I don't want to say it's true, but they were like, you know, this Harrison, Harrison Smith, he's not, he's not just some streamer, right?
[03:58:27.637 --> 03:58:30.718]  He's got a studio and a crew, and it's like, there's something to this.
[03:58:30.758 --> 03:58:30.998]  There's...
[03:58:31.798 --> 03:58:40.080]  There's something that gets through to people that we're not just random dudes sitting in front of a green screen like everybody else.
[03:58:40.100 --> 03:58:40.780]  We have a crew.
[03:58:41.101 --> 03:58:42.301]  We've got people behind us.
[03:58:42.421 --> 03:58:48.082]  We've got this just massive support system that is important in getting this message out there.
[03:58:48.323 --> 03:58:49.343]  So much more powerful.
[03:58:50.123 --> 03:58:54.525]  When it comes from a fully produced, incredible studio like this one.
[03:58:54.826 --> 03:58:58.808]  This place is a Gloriana-class battleship.
[03:58:58.848 --> 03:59:15.637]  This place was the first one made, this place was the best one made, and sadly, without support, it looks like it may fall eventually, and that's a great sadness, but our void shields are down, we're bleeding oxygen, we have torpedoes in us, and still we fight on, and still we continue, because it is our job to continue.
[03:59:16.217 --> 03:59:17.778]  I have been here since I was a little boy.
[03:59:19.139 --> 03:59:24.844]  I've been in this building for 15 years, and I'm lucky that I got to grow up around great people like Harrison Smith.
[03:59:25.165 --> 03:59:29.408]  And I've got to see Harrison grow from being a reporter to having his own show, and he's one of my favorite hosts.
[03:59:29.849 --> 03:59:33.632]  I'm just, I'm very grateful that we're all able to be here today still to cover this kind of thing.
[03:59:33.872 --> 03:59:34.053]  Yeah.
[03:59:34.153 --> 03:59:34.653]  Very grateful.
[03:59:35.134 --> 03:59:35.914]  And you know, we...
[03:59:36.875 --> 03:59:37.776]  We dodged a bullet.
[03:59:37.856 --> 03:59:39.216]  We all dodged a bullet today.
[03:59:39.236 --> 03:59:45.400]  InfoWars has dodged many bullets in the past and will dodge many more into the future, but we need your support to do it.
[03:59:45.480 --> 03:59:47.301]  We will go away without your support.
[03:59:47.721 --> 03:59:48.902]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:49.262 --> 03:59:51.903]  Dr. Jones's Naturals.
[03:59:52.344 --> 03:59:53.744]  These supplements are fantastic.
[03:59:53.804 --> 03:59:54.905]  The products are amazing.
[03:59:55.425 --> 03:59:56.426]  And look, most companies
[03:59:57.086 --> 03:59:58.447]  You know, all they do is sell product.
[03:59:58.768 --> 04:00:02.371]  We sell product as a way to run a massive media organization.
[04:00:02.872 --> 04:00:05.654]  Most media organizations can't even survive these days.
[04:00:05.754 --> 04:00:18.226]  Like, what InfoWars has been able to pull off so far because of your help, because of your support, because of you going to InfoWarsStore.com has been amazing and it will continue to be amazing, but you've got to support us and we so appreciate that you do.
[04:00:19.006 --> 04:00:19.766]  I'm sure you can tell.
[04:00:20.086 --> 04:00:21.867]  I really am starting to fade here.
[04:00:21.907 --> 04:00:23.488]  So I'm going to go home.
[04:00:23.608 --> 04:00:24.768]  I'm going to try to get some sleep.
[04:00:25.268 --> 04:00:29.330]  Chase Geyser, Rex Jones are going to take over and take your calls.
[04:00:29.350 --> 04:00:31.670]  And again, I see the calls already filling up.
[04:00:32.451 --> 04:00:37.212]  And we have some people who actually are either at the rally or have friends at the rally.
[04:00:37.232 --> 04:00:39.193]  So we'll get some firsthand views of this.
[04:00:40.073 --> 04:00:41.294]  But for now, let's go to this.
[04:00:41.834 --> 04:00:46.635]  Let's go to the compilation of Hollywood staccatic terrorism.
[04:00:47.876 --> 04:00:48.216]  Let's watch.
[04:00:49.315 --> 04:00:50.015]  He's not a tough guy.
[04:00:50.055 --> 04:00:51.436]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[04:00:51.636 --> 04:00:52.356]  He's a punk.
[04:00:53.337 --> 04:00:54.117]  He's a dog.
[04:00:54.877 --> 04:00:55.598]  He's a pig.
[04:00:55.618 --> 04:00:57.358]  And he can suck my f***ing a**.
[04:00:57.518 --> 04:00:59.959]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[04:01:00.159 --> 04:01:04.221]  I'll meet him in a hotel room every motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[04:01:04.241 --> 04:01:05.642]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[04:01:05.982 --> 04:01:10.184]  Kiss my motherf***ing a**, you bitch, punk, c*** sucker.
[04:01:19.158 --> 04:01:19.278]  Yes!
[04:01:19.318 --> 04:01:21.060]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[04:01:35.743 --> 04:01:41.966]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[04:01:42.186 --> 04:01:50.970]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:57.113]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[04:01:57.233 --> 04:02:02.436]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[04:02:12.031 --> 04:02:15.954]  Well folks, it's been a hell of a day in the United States of America and the world for that matter.
[04:02:16.694 --> 04:02:19.736]  And I think that Alex said it best.
[04:02:19.756 --> 04:02:21.097]  I think it was Alex who said it.
[04:02:21.337 --> 04:02:22.298]  That it wasn't just...
[04:02:23.376 --> 04:02:24.917]  Donald Trump, who dodged a bullet today.
[04:02:24.957 --> 04:02:25.738]  It was all of us.
[04:02:26.018 --> 04:02:26.458]  That's right.
[04:02:26.959 --> 04:02:29.080]  And we've got several people who have called in.
[04:02:29.141 --> 04:02:36.486]  It's always fun and exciting and high risk to take calls at 1130 on a Saturday night, but this is it for us, so we're going to do it.
[04:02:36.887 --> 04:02:38.828]  Let's go straight to Ben in Virginia.
[04:02:38.848 --> 04:02:39.889]  I want to talk to Ben first.
[04:02:39.949 --> 04:02:42.971]  Ben, you say that you had a friend at the rally.
[04:02:43.212 --> 04:02:44.312]  What are your thoughts about today?
[04:02:44.332 --> 04:02:45.653]  Hi.
[04:02:46.874 --> 04:02:47.915]  Can you guys hear me all right?
[04:02:48.055 --> 04:02:48.296]  Yes.
[04:02:48.336 --> 04:02:51.638]  I can barely hear you guys, so I'm going to try to make sure this is all good.
[04:02:51.658 --> 04:02:52.479]  Did you get shot in the ear?
[04:02:53.900 --> 04:02:55.521]  No, obviously not.
[04:02:56.341 --> 04:03:15.468]  I am deaf a little bit in my right ear, but I want to say, so yeah, one of my, uh, one of my friends, um, I'm connected through some family to this guy, but he was up there in the VIP section and he saw the guy that got his head blown out and he got brain matter splattered on him.
[04:03:15.508 --> 04:03:19.630]  And I just want to say that, um, he saw everything.
[04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:22.371]  He has his own theory about it and,
[04:03:23.268 --> 04:03:26.409]  A lot of people are saying there was two shooters, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[04:03:26.869 --> 04:03:28.129]  He says that there was only one.
[04:03:28.149 --> 04:03:34.770]  It was this guy, and, you know, he's killed, obviously, so we'll never get any answers from this guy.
[04:03:35.671 --> 04:03:44.833]  And, I mean, I just want to say, also, besides that fact, I mean, this dude, I feel so bad for him, because, like, trauma, obviously, seeing this shit person.
[04:03:44.853 --> 04:03:45.453]  That's horrible.
[04:03:45.693 --> 04:03:45.913]  Sure.
[04:03:46.253 --> 04:03:46.993]  No, it's horrible.
[04:03:47.393 --> 04:03:48.833]  Sorry, I didn't mean to curse, by the way.
[04:03:49.313 --> 04:03:51.134]  But, besides that fact,
[04:03:52.122 --> 04:04:05.727]  I've never been in a point in my life where my father has texted me and I've had ten other people, my stepfather, every other person that I've had in my life text me about how angry they are about something.
[04:04:06.787 --> 04:04:18.071]  And I just want to say that America is very lucky today that that bullet did not go one inch to the right because it would not be, we wouldn't be in America right now.
[04:04:18.700 --> 04:04:23.764]  This would be something else right now, and I'd know it for a fact, and I don't want to... I'm not calling for any violence.
[04:04:23.804 --> 04:04:25.125]  Nobody's doing any of that crap.
[04:04:25.565 --> 04:04:31.590]  But I'm just saying, I already know what would happen, and this is... I'm very grateful that Trump is alive.
[04:04:31.810 --> 04:04:32.571]  God bless him.
[04:04:32.911 --> 04:04:34.512]  Jesus was watching for him today.
[04:04:34.992 --> 04:04:36.373]  God was watching for him today.
[04:04:37.054 --> 04:04:41.637]  Everybody out there knows that he's... I mean, God bless.
[04:04:42.078 --> 04:04:44.980]  There's no way that that would have happened without a divine intervention.
[04:04:46.917 --> 04:04:47.877]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:04:48.978 --> 04:04:58.381]  On the one hand, we're very lucky, but on the other hand, what happened was absolutely a tragedy because it shows the point that we've reached as a civilization.
[04:04:58.401 --> 04:05:00.362]  And I guess it's not really new news.
[04:05:00.482 --> 04:05:05.884]  Rex, I'd be interested to hear what you have to think about this because you guys got to keep in mind, it's so easy to forget.
[04:05:07.074 --> 04:05:12.302]  Our own government, our own deep state assassinated the President of the United States in the 60s.
[04:05:12.743 --> 04:05:13.864]  That's what happened to JFK.
[04:05:13.924 --> 04:05:15.787]  And you can argue about whether Mossad was involved.
[04:05:15.967 --> 04:05:17.590]  I personally think that they probably were.
[04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:18.972]  I think it was likely that it was about...
[04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:28.276]  Nuclear proliferation in Israel is something that our CIA wanted to happen to block the Russians or as a defense mechanism against the Russians.
[04:05:28.316 --> 04:05:30.237]  Obviously, the Israelis wanted nuclear power as well.
[04:05:30.698 --> 04:05:43.788]  But ultimately, when push comes to shove, regardless of what other accomplices there may have been or co-conspirators, our own deep state was almost certainly, if not certainly, involved in the assassination of a president of the United States in the 1960s.
[04:05:45.089 --> 04:05:46.010]  A hundred percent.
[04:05:46.230 --> 04:05:49.352]  So there's been no accountability for that.
[04:05:49.712 --> 04:05:52.554]  It's just now they had a reason to do it again.
[04:05:52.574 --> 04:05:57.697]  I guess my point is we've been at this point for decades upon decades now.
[04:05:57.717 --> 04:05:59.278]  I don't think we've reached a new low.
[04:05:59.318 --> 04:05:59.759]  What do you think?
[04:06:00.439 --> 04:06:04.841]  We're very lucky now that we live in a time where there's a million camera angles.
[04:06:05.241 --> 04:06:11.283]  And we're also very unlucky for that because there's a million cameras that they can use to deceive us and spread false information.
[04:06:11.323 --> 04:06:13.024]  They're the true spreaders of misinformation.
[04:06:13.064 --> 04:06:14.124]  Of course, we all know that.
[04:06:14.585 --> 04:06:17.486]  We're very lucky that we live in an age and an era
[04:06:18.126 --> 04:06:26.350]  Where we can see these things happen in real time, and then real-time analysis can happen before all the cobwebs are allowed to be scrubbed off these things.
[04:06:26.410 --> 04:06:29.011]  And it's those tiny little threads that are the most important.
[04:06:29.271 --> 04:06:44.038]  And I think a lot of information's already come out on this that will prove to be, at a bare minimum, incredibly suspect and will lead to investigations, or at a probable, will lead to actual concrete findings on this that, in maybe just a few months' time, or a few years, will prove some shocking details to this story.
[04:06:44.578 --> 04:06:45.438]  Is the collar still online?
[04:06:45.718 --> 04:06:45.979]  Yeah.
[04:06:46.099 --> 04:06:46.779]  Ben, do you have any thoughts?
[04:06:49.807 --> 04:06:51.028]  Looks like we might have lost you, Ben.
[04:06:51.168 --> 04:06:52.068]  Oh, there you are.
[04:06:52.268 --> 04:06:53.489]  You can hear me?
[04:06:53.669 --> 04:06:53.909]  Okay.
[04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.650]  Perfect.
[04:06:54.830 --> 04:07:17.462]  So, the only other thing that I wanted to say about this was, so the guy also that I'm friends with that was literally sitting three feet away from this guy that got shot in the head, he was also saying that this building that is sitting, like, where this guy was that got shot, he literally watched the guy get shot in the head right to the left of him,
[04:07:17.955 --> 04:07:20.976]  And then watch this dude across the way get shot.
[04:07:22.036 --> 04:07:32.638]  This guy was on a building which I can kind of understand how it happened because the building that this dude was sitting on was kind of slanted away from where the Secret Service would be able to see him.
[04:07:32.958 --> 04:07:38.879]  Right, so he was on the other side of the point or the vertex in the roof?
[04:07:38.919 --> 04:07:45.821]  Yes, and I live around, I mean I don't live there, but I go to this area all the time because one of my other family members lives there.
[04:07:46.371 --> 04:07:47.672]  And I've been around there all the time.
[04:07:47.912 --> 04:07:53.877]  And this building that they're talking about, I kind of understand because it's slanted and they might not be able to see it, but why wasn't it secured?
[04:07:54.298 --> 04:07:57.861]  It kind of seems like there might have been some other thing at play, if you know what I'm saying.
[04:07:58.541 --> 04:07:58.782]  Right.
[04:07:59.002 --> 04:08:06.788]  And you can't really poke your head over that point in a roof to shoot somebody without also pointing your rifle over.
[04:08:06.928 --> 04:08:07.509]  No, that's right.
[04:08:07.589 --> 04:08:09.010]  You'd be completely exposed.
[04:08:09.330 --> 04:08:10.571]  You'd be completely exposed.
[04:08:10.611 --> 04:08:11.452]  There's no way.
[04:08:11.552 --> 04:08:14.655]  There's no other way unless you're literally leaning over
[04:08:16.262 --> 04:08:22.345]  I mean, at least from your stomach over, with your rifle over the top of that, there's no way.
[04:08:22.505 --> 04:08:30.687]  And I don't know, because if you look at the videos with the Secret Service, I mean, it looks like he might have identified the target a little bit before that happened.
[04:08:30.767 --> 04:08:32.968]  But I mean, still, regardless, you don't know.
[04:08:32.988 --> 04:08:33.829]  We don't know.
[04:08:33.849 --> 04:08:37.790]  I don't know what's really going on, and nobody really knows at this moment, to be honest.
[04:08:38.294 --> 04:08:44.742]  How do these people who are military trained doing security for President Trump, how do you miss the rifle?
[04:08:44.842 --> 04:08:45.763]  That's my question.
[04:08:45.803 --> 04:08:46.924]  How do you miss the rifle?
[04:08:47.005 --> 04:08:48.006]  Rifle is quite large.
[04:08:48.026 --> 04:08:49.548]  Oh, I'm telling you right now, I wouldn't miss it.
[04:08:50.669 --> 04:08:51.210]  No, that's right.
[04:08:52.324 --> 04:08:52.544]  Yeah.
[04:08:52.864 --> 04:09:04.813]  Well, I mean, if they've been repeatedly asking for resources and more manpower for months and months, and the Biden administration has been denying that, maybe this is just an issue of starvation of resources.
[04:09:04.853 --> 04:09:09.897]  Maybe they just, maybe they're like Ukraine and they simply don't have enough boots on the ground to fight off the Russians, so to speak.
[04:09:09.997 --> 04:09:14.120]  Well, maybe Trump got the B team, like the JV Secret Service.
[04:09:14.300 --> 04:09:19.665]  That's kind of the feeling I got watching that clip of that lady trying to reholster her weapon, and that's quite ridiculous.
[04:09:19.725 --> 04:09:29.913]  I didn't see that prior, I guess it came out it was new, but I've been watching this stream since 8, since coming from the church to come here, and that's like real Special Olympics type stuff.
[04:09:30.646 --> 04:09:30.966]  Yeah.
[04:09:30.986 --> 04:09:32.188]  Ben, thank you so much for your call.
[04:09:32.268 --> 04:09:32.908]  Great stuff there.
[04:09:32.928 --> 04:09:33.769]  Thank you for your feedback.
[04:09:33.829 --> 04:09:35.431]  I hope you and your friend are both doing well.
[04:09:35.611 --> 04:09:36.252]  God bless you.
[04:09:36.312 --> 04:09:39.235]  Let's go to Black Rant in South Carolina.
[04:09:39.295 --> 04:09:40.777]  Black Rant, what do you have to say?
[04:09:43.119 --> 04:09:44.621]  Hey, Chase and Rex.
[04:09:45.322 --> 04:09:47.304]  It's actually wonderful to see you guys tonight.
[04:09:47.384 --> 04:09:48.585]  Rex, you're doing a good job.
[04:09:48.605 --> 04:09:51.208]  You sound exactly like your dad, except without the raspier.
[04:09:54.742 --> 04:09:56.363]  Excellent thing, you guys.
[04:09:56.503 --> 04:10:01.204]  Like the caller before said, we are so lucky.
[04:10:01.865 --> 04:10:05.726]  Jesus is not just protecting Trump, he's protecting all of us.
[04:10:05.846 --> 04:10:16.350]  We are walking into a new world where if we stray just to the right a little, one degree this way or one degree that way,
[04:10:17.009 --> 04:10:20.711]  We could end up in a terrible, dystopic future.
[04:10:20.731 --> 04:10:22.332]  The path is narrow.
[04:10:23.153 --> 04:10:24.854]  The path is very narrow.
[04:10:24.874 --> 04:10:26.175]  I see a narrow way through.
[04:10:26.195 --> 04:10:27.636]  But go ahead.
[04:10:27.936 --> 04:10:28.156]  Yes.
[04:10:28.836 --> 04:10:29.477]  No, no, no.
[04:10:30.337 --> 04:10:34.980]  We have to kind of keep, you know, you know how that saying goes, keep that same energy, bro.
[04:10:35.000 --> 04:10:44.726]  Like, we have to keep an energy of upliftment, of faith, of positivity, because I feel like that's the energy that's been
[04:10:45.487 --> 04:10:47.268]  Uh, getting us in the right mind state.
[04:10:47.288 --> 04:10:47.669]  The love.
[04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:49.930]  Of course we have to, the love.
[04:10:49.970 --> 04:10:52.872]  Of course we have to like, you know, give it up to Jesus, to God.
[04:10:52.912 --> 04:10:58.876]  I mean, but, um, Chase, you and I had a conversation a couple of weeks back and it was great.
[04:10:59.437 --> 04:11:04.540]  And I, I, there was a Twitter space the other day that Alex held.
[04:11:05.260 --> 04:11:09.523]  Um, and I have a couple of points, but I want to make sure I get through them very quickly.
[04:11:09.543 --> 04:11:11.945]  Cause I don't want to take up too much of your time, but, um,
[04:11:13.471 --> 04:11:17.712]  It's crazy to me how people can still go to these Trump rallies and act like it's a party.
[04:11:18.373 --> 04:11:19.153]  It's crazy.
[04:11:19.253 --> 04:11:20.873]  Rex was mentioning that earlier.
[04:11:21.974 --> 04:11:22.194]  Yes.
[04:11:22.614 --> 04:11:22.794]  Preach.
[04:11:22.854 --> 04:11:23.954]  It's insane.
[04:11:24.955 --> 04:11:25.935]  It's insane to me.
[04:11:26.055 --> 04:11:33.717]  It's like, January 6th, anybody who was at January 6th knows that that whole section was blocked off.
[04:11:34.117 --> 04:11:39.499]  If you looked around and had any situational awareness, you could see the Air Force
[04:11:39.864 --> 04:11:43.367]  The FBI, you could see Secret Service, everybody walking around.
[04:11:43.427 --> 04:11:46.129]  It did not have the same vibe as a normal Trump rally.
[04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:53.094]  And so when people go to Trump rallies now, I don't understand how they can sit there and just think, oh, this is like a rock concert.
[04:11:53.555 --> 04:11:55.116]  This is for the fate.
[04:11:55.156 --> 04:11:56.297]  This is for all the marvels.
[04:11:56.357 --> 04:11:58.398]  This is for the fate of the world.
[04:11:58.999 --> 04:11:59.559]  Yeah.
[04:12:00.720 --> 04:12:04.323]  I was at an event tonight, so I couldn't like, I do my own thing.
[04:12:04.363 --> 04:12:06.865]  I do my own little social media live streaming and all that stuff.
[04:12:07.065 --> 04:12:08.166]  I couldn't do it at the time.
[04:12:08.706 --> 04:12:09.487]  I was doing a gig.
[04:12:10.689 --> 04:12:14.432]  But I was at a hotel, and they were playing this on the television screen.
[04:12:15.293 --> 04:12:16.214]  And I was like, what?
[04:12:16.754 --> 04:12:18.656]  You know, the Trump assassination attempt?
[04:12:18.816 --> 04:12:25.762]  Obviously, it felt surreal because we know that this was the last card that they had to play.
[04:12:26.182 --> 04:12:28.144]  We are aware that this was going to happen.
[04:12:28.404 --> 04:12:32.588]  So when it happens, you're almost like, no, this is crazy.
[04:12:33.288 --> 04:12:35.070]  We knew this was all that they had left.
[04:12:35.310 --> 04:12:38.853]  So when I see this on the television screen, it's on the news.
[04:12:39.474 --> 04:12:43.177]  I hear a couple people, some people are concerned, some people are like, oh my God.
[04:12:43.857 --> 04:12:47.220]  And then I hear other people go, well, he had it coming.
[04:12:48.361 --> 04:12:49.482]  Well, that's what you get.
[04:12:50.522 --> 04:12:55.146]  Uh, well, you know, I'm glad I, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I wish they would have gotten him.
[04:12:55.286 --> 04:12:56.587]  I wish they would have, wouldn't have missed.
[04:12:58.248 --> 04:13:07.235]  That made my blood boil just because we are so spoiled in America where we think that our opinions,
[04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:08.110]  Yeah.
[04:13:18.214 --> 04:13:22.078]  There's a woman who was standing on the corner.
[04:13:22.178 --> 04:13:36.431]  I just want to say, I think one of the factors that people are missing about this assassination attempt at Rex, and I'd love to hear your feedback on this too, is very quickly after he was shot, he ducks down and Secret Service surrounds him in like the body shell.
[04:13:36.451 --> 04:13:37.692]  I don't know whatever you would call it, right?
[04:13:38.393 --> 04:13:43.758]  And you hear the shooter pop off three or four more shots,
[04:13:45.069 --> 04:13:47.030]  I don't think Trump was the target anymore.
[04:13:47.411 --> 04:13:52.474]  I think that guy thought he got him, or thought he just couldn't get him anymore.
[04:13:52.514 --> 04:13:53.635]  Either, oh I got him.
[04:13:53.955 --> 04:13:57.597]  And I think he started shooting at other people that were at the event.
[04:13:57.617 --> 04:14:05.803]  I think this was an assassination attempt on Trump, but I also think that it was a mass shooting against MAGA Patriots.
[04:14:05.943 --> 04:14:06.623]  What do you think, Rex?
[04:14:06.743 --> 04:14:09.405]  Well, by definition it was definitely a mass shooting.
[04:14:09.465 --> 04:14:14.849]  I mean, one person killed, two people critically injured, Trump moderately injured, sustained injury, whatever you want to call it.
[04:14:15.529 --> 04:14:16.590]  How's it going, y'all?
[04:14:16.610 --> 04:14:19.131]  I'm up to date on the Trump assassination attempts.
[04:14:45.794 --> 04:14:48.915]  It definitely was divine intervention.
[04:14:48.935 --> 04:14:59.397]  And the reason I know, to make a long story short, back in 2015, I was robbed at gunpoint, and there was only like $3 in there.
[04:14:59.477 --> 04:15:09.160]  It's a long story, there's more to it, but as I drove off, he tried to shoot me from behind, and it blew a big, giant circle in my rear view, right?
[04:15:09.560 --> 04:15:13.441]  Not a scratch, nothing but a little sliver of a projectile.
[04:15:13.521 --> 04:15:14.681]  That's not a scratch.
[04:15:15.191 --> 04:15:17.572]  He emptied his whole clip trying to hit me as I drove off.
[04:15:18.592 --> 04:15:18.992]  Wow.
[04:15:19.972 --> 04:15:21.613]  So you've been through this experience.
[04:15:21.633 --> 04:15:27.074]  Tell me a little bit about what you felt like in the hours after that happened to you.
[04:15:27.134 --> 04:15:31.055]  I mean, a lot of people have been speculating about what Trump's mindset was going to be.
[04:15:31.075 --> 04:15:35.056]  People say he was in shock when he was asking about his shoes and stuff like that.
[04:15:35.296 --> 04:15:38.037]  What was your state of mind immediately after this happened to you?
[04:15:38.957 --> 04:15:41.978]  Well, the next morning it was the best breakfast I ever had.
[04:15:42.697 --> 04:15:45.360]  Well, Bart, I'm glad you're still with us and calling in.
[04:15:45.580 --> 04:15:47.382]  Always great taking your calls.
[04:15:47.422 --> 04:15:48.143]  Rex, what are your thoughts?
[04:15:48.183 --> 04:15:49.464]  Have you ever had a near-death experience?
[04:16:05.222 --> 04:16:06.023]  I've had a couple.
[04:16:06.063 --> 04:16:09.166]  I've had some times where, like, I flipped an ATV when I was younger.
[04:16:09.226 --> 04:16:11.087]  That was very close to death.
[04:16:11.488 --> 04:16:15.411]  I've had some other projectile incidents, but, of course, all accidents and stuff like that.
[04:16:15.451 --> 04:16:17.393]  Just stupid things that happen in the country.
[04:16:17.653 --> 04:16:17.853]  Yeah.
[04:16:18.114 --> 04:16:20.075]  You know, like, small, tiny brain moments.
[04:16:20.175 --> 04:16:21.697]  But nothing deliberate.
[04:16:21.717 --> 04:16:23.278]  And I want to ask you about that, Bart.
[04:16:23.398 --> 04:16:28.883]  I mean, what was it like for you in the initial... If you can think back to that, if it's a painful memory, I'm sorry.
[04:16:28.923 --> 04:16:29.924]  I imagine it must be.
[04:16:29.984 --> 04:16:31.346]  I don't have experience with that.
[04:16:32.026 --> 04:16:36.472]  What was your mental state like, and what did you think of Donald Trump reacting the way that he did?
[04:16:39.436 --> 04:16:41.418]  My feeling about my personal experience?
[04:16:41.458 --> 04:16:46.384]  Well, I was grateful that I'm not in a wheelchair and I'm not dead, obviously.
[04:16:46.404 --> 04:16:48.287]  But what was your second question about Trump?
[04:16:49.031 --> 04:17:04.462]  I mean, just, well you two have had a comparable experience, both been shot at, his ear got blown off obviously, but I just, looking at his reaction, the way that he instantly ducked, the way that he instantly got out of the way before Secret Service was able to intervene, do you think he was thinking sharp in that moment?
[04:17:05.953 --> 04:17:07.174]  Well, it's all instinct.
[04:17:07.214 --> 04:17:11.375]  Like, when I had the gun in my face and all that, I wasn't scared at all.
[04:17:11.475 --> 04:17:15.677]  I was just totally cool and I tricked the guy and everything and kept my head.
[04:17:16.477 --> 04:17:28.862]  I became scared, like, later with PTSD with, you know, the bad dreams and the thoughts and stuff like that, but... We gotta pray for Trump going through that kind of stuff, because he's definitely got some PTSD after this.
[04:17:28.902 --> 04:17:30.303]  I mean, he loves those rallies, man.
[04:17:32.580 --> 04:17:36.422]  Yeah, it looked like the bullet grazed his face as well as his ear.
[04:17:36.442 --> 04:17:42.585]  I don't know if that's just blood coming down, but man, he's lucky and he knows God saved him.
[04:17:43.425 --> 04:17:44.206]  Absolutely, Bart.
[04:17:44.226 --> 04:17:45.506]  Thanks for your call.
[04:17:46.427 --> 04:17:48.688]  Let's go to Drew in California.
[04:17:49.008 --> 04:17:50.649]  You think Trump had a gut feeling?
[04:17:50.729 --> 04:17:51.810]  Drew, what are your thoughts?
[04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:52.630]  Go ahead, crew.
[04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:54.491]  Click on Drew in California, third from the bottom.
[04:17:56.772 --> 04:17:57.472]  Hold on a second, Drew.
[04:17:57.492 --> 04:17:57.873]  There you are.
[04:17:58.293 --> 04:17:58.853]  I can hear you now.
[04:18:00.234 --> 04:18:00.634]  Alrighty.
[04:18:01.152 --> 04:18:03.373]  No, I was saying I had a gut feeling.
[04:18:03.393 --> 04:18:04.673]  Oh, you did?
[04:18:04.693 --> 04:18:10.094]  For some reason before I was watching Right Side Broadcast.
[04:18:11.574 --> 04:18:14.615]  They were covering it pretty good before you guys hopped on, obviously.
[04:18:14.835 --> 04:18:15.035]  Yeah.
[04:18:15.195 --> 04:18:16.756]  Anyway, I'll try to keep it short, too.
[04:18:16.776 --> 04:18:19.476]  OK, take your time.
[04:18:21.757 --> 04:18:30.599]  Throughout my life, I've had this feeling, you know, like not an adrenaline feeling, not a, you know, feeling.
[04:18:31.306 --> 04:18:35.069]  But a gut feeling that, oh, something's going to happen today.
[04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:45.156]  And that's either I get in a fight, a car crash, you know, a significant big thing that happened in my life.
[04:18:45.176 --> 04:18:47.958]  I've just got a great, like, premonition or intuition about these things.
[04:18:48.118 --> 04:18:48.859]  A ripple in the force.
[04:18:48.879 --> 04:18:49.159]  Correct.
[04:18:50.600 --> 04:18:51.001]  Correct.
[04:18:51.301 --> 04:18:51.581]  Oh, yeah.
[04:18:51.621 --> 04:18:52.822]  And then shout out to Rex.
[04:18:52.902 --> 04:18:53.542]  How's it going?
[04:18:53.582 --> 04:18:55.084]  I haven't seen you on here for a while.
[04:18:55.104 --> 04:18:56.805]  Doing pretty good tonight.
[04:18:57.188 --> 04:18:58.950]  Yeah, it's pretty good to be on.
[04:18:59.130 --> 04:19:07.036]  I mean, growing up all around this, I didn't want InfoWars to become my whole identity, but I support things here, and I'm still working as part of the InfoWar.
[04:19:07.857 --> 04:19:09.198]  You're definitely on point.
[04:19:09.658 --> 04:19:16.624]  So, what I was getting at is, literally 20 or 30 minutes before it happened, I'm waiting.
[04:19:16.644 --> 04:19:20.808]  I'm like, this is... Something didn't feel right.
[04:19:20.848 --> 04:19:22.689]  It didn't look right, obviously.
[04:19:22.709 --> 04:19:25.872]  I didn't relate this to the Trump thing.
[04:19:26.653 --> 04:19:28.654]  But I'm like, something is going to happen today.
[04:19:29.895 --> 04:19:33.918]  Something big is going to happen today, either to me or something's going to happen.
[04:19:34.058 --> 04:19:35.138]  And sure enough, it did.
[04:19:35.759 --> 04:19:39.661]  I watched it live when the shots went off and he went down.
[04:19:42.663 --> 04:19:44.805]  First, I thought he hit his earpiece.
[04:19:46.846 --> 04:19:51.709]  And then when it started ringing out immediately, as soon as it happened, I knew it wasn't.
[04:19:53.690 --> 04:19:54.811]  What I was scared about
[04:19:55.934 --> 04:20:02.557]  Is since the camera that I was watching did not move, that he was still getting drilled.
[04:20:04.098 --> 04:20:04.318]  Right.
[04:20:04.658 --> 04:20:05.558]  I thought he was dead.
[04:20:05.638 --> 04:20:08.500]  I thought he was dead as soon as I saw him go down.
[04:20:08.680 --> 04:20:22.666]  And then this too, just like, if somebody, and it doesn't even have to be your family member, just somebody significant that dies, like, and you just get the phone call or you see it and you're like, you're flabbergasted.
[04:20:23.026 --> 04:20:25.287]  I was, I didn't know how to react.
[04:20:26.377 --> 04:20:30.080]  I've put out my friend that almost died catching on fire.
[04:20:30.280 --> 04:20:31.881]  I put him out with a hose.
[04:20:32.662 --> 04:20:36.865]  I actually saved him again after he got hit by a car and got him upright.
[04:20:36.885 --> 04:20:40.747]  This guy's got the worst luck ever, man!
[04:20:40.867 --> 04:20:42.108]  His skull and everything.
[04:20:43.069 --> 04:20:44.510]  And saved him twice.
[04:20:44.610 --> 04:20:46.672]  And I've been through some crazy stuff.
[04:20:46.732 --> 04:20:48.153]  I've had guns pulled on me.
[04:20:48.173 --> 04:20:50.074]  And that's what I want to say too.
[04:20:50.094 --> 04:20:52.676]  When that, like that other guy was saying,
[04:20:56.348 --> 04:21:06.711]  Besides God intervening in all of our life, whether we accept it or not, He has saved me multiple times.
[04:21:06.952 --> 04:21:08.772]  I've had guns pulled on me twice.
[04:21:08.792 --> 04:21:11.353]  I don't know how the hell I wasn't shot.
[04:21:13.255 --> 04:21:25.843]  Um, I've gotten beat up, uh, head slammed in the concrete like a basketball and kicked in the face and jumped and everything and almost died if the ambulance didn't get there within 15 minutes.
[04:21:27.012 --> 04:21:28.532]  Because I was losing so much blood.
[04:21:28.633 --> 04:21:30.893]  Well, Drew, I'm glad that you're still with us.
[04:21:31.813 --> 04:21:33.574]  And thank you so much for your call.
[04:21:34.134 --> 04:21:34.754]  I appreciate that.
[04:21:34.774 --> 04:21:38.896]  I think a lot of people had some intuition that something was going to go wrong today.
[04:21:38.916 --> 04:21:40.116]  I know Rex did.
[04:21:40.876 --> 04:21:42.497]  Alex has a sense of these things.
[04:21:42.537 --> 04:21:52.900]  I didn't have any intuitive understanding or feeling about what was going to happen today, but just intellectually, cognitively, consciously, I knew something was going to happen to Trump before this race was over.
[04:21:52.920 --> 04:21:53.560]  What are your thoughts, Rex?
[04:21:54.099 --> 04:21:57.862]  I only have a little bit of that discernment ability, only just a tiny bit.
[04:21:58.122 --> 04:22:03.786]  Alex has such a great amount of it that it blasts him day in and day out and day in and day out.
[04:22:03.846 --> 04:22:05.106]  And he's picking up a lot of channels.
[04:22:05.266 --> 04:22:12.952]  Yeah, he's picking up a lot of channels, and I think that's one of the things that people fail to appreciate about him is, oh, he's funny, oh, he's a great newscaster, whatever.
[04:22:13.312 --> 04:22:14.793]  That man's dialed into something.
[04:22:15.033 --> 04:22:24.019]  And trust me, me and Alex have our issues, but I'll always be a diehard InfoWars supporter because I know that he's connected to something that most of us can't even grasp.
[04:22:24.539 --> 04:22:26.140]  Yeah, heavy is the crown too.
[04:22:26.160 --> 04:22:26.800]  It's true.
[04:22:27.041 --> 04:22:29.602]  Who wants to be aware of so much of the evil?
[04:22:30.182 --> 04:22:32.704]  You know, ignorance really is bliss to a certain extent.
[04:22:32.904 --> 04:22:33.404]  No, 100%.
[04:22:33.584 --> 04:22:45.731]  And I do not envy some of the abilities and talent that Alex has by way of understanding the mechanisms and psychology and just machinations of evil.
[04:22:46.751 --> 04:22:59.778]  And that's one of the things, I mean, that's why I kind of removed myself from this place, is because I grew up here, like, my childhood was watching news, you know, watching all these crazy events happen, watching the Obama administration, watching the Bush administration.
[04:22:59.818 --> 04:23:12.285]  I mean, some of those are my earliest memories, and it's all very, very painful once you get a decade into it, and just appreciate the hosts here, appreciate the show, appreciate what you've got, because we do it for you guys.
[04:23:12.625 --> 04:23:13.946]  Like, this is about the viewer.
[04:23:14.887 --> 04:23:15.388]  Absolutely.
[04:23:15.728 --> 04:23:17.569]  It's about humanity, really.
[04:23:18.050 --> 04:23:28.339]  I mean, we favor our viewers because our viewers have supported us and kept us on the air doing this and going to infowarsstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com has been our lifeblood.
[04:23:28.819 --> 04:23:32.642]  And obviously we love you, but this is not just about you guys.
[04:23:32.682 --> 04:23:33.983]  We're actually doing this for
[04:23:34.964 --> 04:23:35.704]  The left, too.
[04:23:35.924 --> 04:23:37.605]  We're doing this for the leftists, too.
[04:23:37.985 --> 04:23:39.646]  Those who are ignorant, even those who are evil.
[04:23:39.686 --> 04:23:44.808]  We're doing this because we are answering the calling to love one another as Jesus has loved us.
[04:23:45.829 --> 04:23:47.410]  It's the 11th commandment, really.
[04:23:48.390 --> 04:23:52.172]  And this is something that we do out of love for our enemies, too.
[04:23:52.352 --> 04:23:52.652]  That's right.
[04:23:52.672 --> 04:23:58.474]  Bash them, berate them, challenge them and stand up to them and try to purge the evil, exercise the evil from them.
[04:23:58.654 --> 04:23:59.055]  We do.
[04:23:59.135 --> 04:23:59.835]  We do that.
[04:24:00.075 --> 04:24:02.696]  And we do call them out because, of course, evil must be called out.
[04:24:02.716 --> 04:24:04.437]  But we also must pray for our enemies.
[04:24:04.897 --> 04:24:15.349]  And that's the whole ethos and the whole root of when people criticize us, people like on the actual extremist right, for example, say InfoWars is controlled, they don't go hard enough.
[04:24:15.890 --> 04:24:17.672]  Well, what would you have us do?
[04:24:18.033 --> 04:24:20.816]  Would you have us stone these people figuratively?
[04:24:20.856 --> 04:24:22.498]  Would you have us actually attack them?
[04:24:22.938 --> 04:24:24.860]  No, because then we would become like them.
[04:24:25.601 --> 04:24:31.123]  And the whole ethos of this place is, even though it's an info war, we do things through civil disobedience.
[04:24:31.483 --> 04:24:35.324]  And even speaking now is civil disobedience, which is why they're trying to shut this place down.
[04:24:35.624 --> 04:24:37.365]  And we will never become like them.
[04:24:37.945 --> 04:24:38.705]  We are like you.
[04:24:38.925 --> 04:24:39.766]  We are good people.
[04:24:39.926 --> 04:24:43.907]  We are people that love God, we are people that love America, and we are people that love our families.
[04:24:44.107 --> 04:24:48.148]  And these people, they don't love God, they don't have a country, and they don't know their family.
[04:24:48.488 --> 04:24:50.169]  And that's the key difference between them and us.
[04:24:50.689 --> 04:24:50.889]  Yeah.
[04:24:51.209 --> 04:24:53.570]  And then the left says, oh, you're just on air to sell supplements.
[04:24:53.971 --> 04:24:57.653]  And they don't get it because we don't go on air to sell supplements.
[04:24:57.693 --> 04:25:01.314]  We sell supplements so we can go on air.
[04:25:01.414 --> 04:25:11.399]  I watched every second of the Sandy Hook trial, and they had some financial guy from some university come up and say, Alex is worth $273 million.
[04:25:11.439 --> 04:25:13.240]  And that's part of what they based the judgment on.
[04:25:13.580 --> 04:25:17.382]  Just assuming, because they genuinely believe that he squirreled away this money.
[04:25:17.422 --> 04:25:18.183]  There is no money.
[04:25:18.843 --> 04:25:23.428]  Like, like, generational wealth has been burned to keep the lights on here, you know?
[04:25:23.468 --> 04:25:25.009]  And it's been that way for a very long time.
[04:25:25.369 --> 04:25:32.716]  My father went through a nearly decade-long divorce, and he chose to burn money to keep us warm, and that's who Alex Jones is.
[04:25:32.757 --> 04:25:33.717]  That's what this place is.
[04:25:34.098 --> 04:25:35.900]  And if this place was about profit,
[04:25:36.400 --> 04:25:39.581]  Then it would have burned long ago when they came to attack it.
[04:25:39.921 --> 04:25:54.426]  There's a Bible verse, I'm not going to quote it because I'm not going to butcher scripture, but essentially a fire shall reveal the worth of the works and anything that's made of straw or wood or clay shall be burned, but the true precious jewels, the gold, it will stay.
[04:25:55.106 --> 04:25:56.107]  And that's what this place is.
[04:25:56.167 --> 04:25:57.347]  It's the true precious jewels.
[04:25:57.407 --> 04:25:57.968]  It's the gold.
[04:25:58.328 --> 04:26:01.450]  And I don't say that this place is some beacon of religious preaching.
[04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:02.470]  It certainly is not.
[04:26:02.731 --> 04:26:06.633]  But we are a beacon of information and that can certainly lead to people's spiritual awakening.
[04:26:06.893 --> 04:26:08.194]  And that's something that's very important.
[04:26:08.254 --> 04:26:11.596]  All these secular media sources, even Fox News and places like that.
[04:26:12.176 --> 04:26:13.456]  Yeah, we're in the Van Allen Belt.
[04:26:32.401 --> 04:26:36.144]  One of the biggest in the fleet that has been completely surrounded by the enemy.
[04:26:36.264 --> 04:26:40.188]  Thousands of Void ships, we were just getting blasted with Laz Cannons and we are still here.
[04:26:40.608 --> 04:26:41.609]  And one day we will fall.
[04:26:42.490 --> 04:26:45.292]  And when that happens, maybe there will be more appreciation, who knows?
[04:26:45.832 --> 04:26:45.992]  But...
[04:26:46.997 --> 04:26:48.038]  We are the resistance.
[04:26:48.098 --> 04:26:49.039]  They took that phrase.
[04:26:49.079 --> 04:26:50.920]  They twisted it because that's what evil does.
[04:26:51.501 --> 04:26:53.523]  Just like in Lord of the Rings, J.R.R.
[04:26:53.563 --> 04:26:54.243]  Tolkien's works.
[04:26:54.303 --> 04:26:55.384]  They were elves once.
[04:26:55.845 --> 04:27:01.029]  They took that beautiful phrase, you are the resistance, which we've been saying for decades and decades and decades.
[04:27:01.049 --> 04:27:02.530]  I've heard that since I was a little boy.
[04:27:02.931 --> 04:27:04.973]  And they took that and turned it into a symbol of Hillary Clinton.
[04:27:05.653 --> 04:27:05.873]  Yeah.
[04:27:06.894 --> 04:27:10.778]  Well, even was it Shia LaBeouf that put up the flag that just said resist after Trump was elected?
[04:27:10.798 --> 04:27:11.458]  And then they found it.
[04:27:12.379 --> 04:27:13.360]  Everybody resisted it.
[04:27:14.960 --> 04:27:16.181]  But let's take some more calls.
[04:27:16.261 --> 04:27:19.643]  Yeah, let's do one more call, and then we're going to wrap because it's coming up to midnight.
[04:27:20.103 --> 04:27:27.687]  But we will be uploading reports throughout the night, and we will be broadcasting earlier than our normally scheduled time tomorrow.
[04:27:27.707 --> 04:27:33.130]  We usually do the Alex Jones Show on Sundays at 4 p.m.
[04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.630]  Central.
[04:27:33.671 --> 04:27:34.931]  We're going to go to one more caller.
[04:27:35.051 --> 04:27:35.632]  One more caller.
[04:27:35.652 --> 04:27:36.972]  Hey, Rex, I'm going to let you pick it, man.
[04:27:36.992 --> 04:27:38.273]  You get the honorary last call pick.
[04:27:38.413 --> 04:27:42.295]  All right, we're going to go to James in Colorado because he's been on hold the longest.
[04:27:42.335 --> 04:27:43.236]  All right, James, you got it.
[04:27:44.599 --> 04:27:45.779]  Man, how's it going, guys?
[04:27:46.039 --> 04:27:46.679]  Good, how are you?
[04:27:47.580 --> 04:27:48.580]  I'm great, man.
[04:27:48.660 --> 04:27:54.361]  I just like to say that I want to commend y'all on the prayers, you know, live on the air.
[04:27:54.841 --> 04:27:56.401]  You don't see that in the news these days.
[04:27:56.861 --> 04:27:59.362]  And let me tell you, putting God first is going to get us through this.
[04:28:00.202 --> 04:28:08.183]  And I really appreciate and I want to show my gratitude for doing that for so many people.
[04:28:08.203 --> 04:28:10.604]  You know, I prayed with you several times a day.
[04:28:10.644 --> 04:28:11.364]  I've been tuning in.
[04:28:11.977 --> 04:28:12.537]  For hours.
[04:28:12.658 --> 04:28:15.580]  I'm an honorably discharged combat infantry veteran.
[04:28:16.200 --> 04:28:20.303]  I know a lot of protocols when it comes to protecting presidents overseas.
[04:28:20.343 --> 04:28:24.066]  I've been in Egypt a lot of times when the Secretary of State would come out.
[04:28:24.967 --> 04:28:35.615]  I was 11 Bravo Infantry, so we were pretty much, you know, when they came over there, and I know the protocols, and I see a lot of the things that you see, and it concerns me.
[04:28:35.715 --> 04:28:39.018]  It really does, like how that building wasn't covered.
[04:28:39.498 --> 04:28:40.499]  You know, you're talking to
[04:28:41.300 --> 04:28:42.621]  A combat infantry veteran.
[04:28:42.661 --> 04:28:44.301]  I'm telling you, that building shouldn't be covered.
[04:28:45.642 --> 04:28:51.984]  So, for that not to be covered, it really reiterates a lot of things and a lot of the theories that are actually facts.
[04:28:52.124 --> 04:28:52.904]  I mean, I'm seeing it.
[04:28:52.924 --> 04:28:55.425]  I tune in once in a while with y'all.
[04:28:56.846 --> 04:29:03.928]  My father's more of a Trump supporter, but I've got to say, after tonight, I may be a Patriot again.
[04:29:04.008 --> 04:29:10.691]  I see what's going on, and it concerns me as not only a combat infantry veteran, but just as an American citizen.
[04:29:11.500 --> 04:29:12.621]  And I also live in Colorado.
[04:29:12.661 --> 04:29:14.601]  I'm concerned about those comments.
[04:29:15.862 --> 04:29:17.423]  We're in Colorado Springs right now.
[04:29:17.503 --> 04:29:25.326]  I saw that you—it's amazing to get through, because you just screenshotted an article from the Gazette in Colorado Springs.
[04:29:25.906 --> 04:29:33.730]  You also mentioned what I think Woodrow was saying, how comparing Trump to the devil after he just got shot.
[04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:38.492]  Well, I just want to let you know that Southern Colorado and Colorado doesn't support that.
[04:29:39.775 --> 04:29:41.397]  We don't support that kind of evil out here.
[04:29:41.637 --> 04:29:43.158]  At least, you know, it's godly folk.
[04:29:44.179 --> 04:29:46.680]  My wife has had anxiety all day before this happened.
[04:29:47.641 --> 04:29:53.985]  I really paid attention five days ago when Alex Jones said what he said, and let me tell you, I'm on board.
[04:29:54.126 --> 04:30:05.053]  You know, you have a veteran on board, and y'all are touching on a lot of facts, and I'm so appreciative of how much y'all are doing right now.
[04:30:05.614 --> 04:30:07.215]  I think you're the only outlet right now.
[04:30:07.571 --> 04:30:09.918]  That's getting the truth out there and putting God first.
[04:30:10.118 --> 04:30:10.961]  And I commend you.
[04:30:12.359 --> 04:30:13.399]  It's all we can do.
[04:30:13.679 --> 04:30:14.920]  It's the best we can do.
[04:30:15.100 --> 04:30:26.982]  It's shameful that it's so little that we can do to spread this information, but it's great to get to talk to people like you just around the nation, around the country as a whole, because I truly believe that people are waking up.
[04:30:27.582 --> 04:30:28.603]  And here's my thing.
[04:30:28.683 --> 04:30:33.284]  I left this place because of political differences that I had with Infowars during the 2020 election.
[04:30:33.344 --> 04:30:34.984]  I personally was very critical of Trump.
[04:30:35.444 --> 04:30:39.585]  I was not the biggest Trump guy, but I am tooting that horn hard
[04:30:40.625 --> 04:30:40.785]  Right.
[04:30:41.046 --> 04:30:42.607]  Because I feel like I have no choice.
[04:30:44.027 --> 04:30:44.848]  Amen, amen.
[04:30:45.368 --> 04:30:47.930]  And I appreciate y'all fighting a good fight.
[04:30:48.390 --> 04:30:49.871]  I'm not going to keep much of your time.
[04:30:50.772 --> 04:30:55.255]  Us in Colorado don't support that comment from Woodrow, and I want to put that out there.
[04:30:55.635 --> 04:31:00.838]  There's a lot of great people in Colorado, and that's not a representation of our state.
[04:31:01.419 --> 04:31:02.920]  And when I heard that, I got irate.
[04:31:02.940 --> 04:31:07.462]  And you have to know that once I heard that and I saw that, I was tuning in with y'all when I heard it.
[04:31:08.023 --> 04:31:09.704]  And I heard, personally,
[04:31:10.137 --> 04:31:11.898]  And I'm not one to put that type of info.
[04:31:11.978 --> 04:31:14.199]  I'm sure, you know, many, many, many people heard it.
[04:31:14.459 --> 04:31:19.181]  But we heard a lot of gunshots out here in Colorado Springs tonight after everything that happened.
[04:31:19.581 --> 04:31:27.624]  I don't know if it's just regular crime rate or whatever, but, you know, as a father of four girls, you know, and a family man, that concerns me.
[04:31:27.644 --> 04:31:29.425]  And it does hit home.
[04:31:29.605 --> 04:31:30.405]  It does hit home.
[04:31:30.985 --> 04:31:32.986]  And I really appreciate what y'all are doing, man.
[04:31:33.373 --> 04:31:35.895]  Well, James, you're not taking up too much of our time or anything.
[04:31:35.915 --> 04:31:36.995]  We really appreciate you.
[04:31:37.035 --> 04:31:39.737]  I appreciate all the viewers because I, myself, am a viewer.
[04:31:39.797 --> 04:31:41.078]  You know, I'm a big fan of this place.
[04:31:41.498 --> 04:31:43.399]  Who's your favorite host?
[04:31:43.820 --> 04:31:47.642]  I'm just kidding.
[04:31:47.662 --> 04:31:51.144]  Alex, Harrison, Owen, and then, like, you're, like, here.
[04:31:52.105 --> 04:31:53.586]  No, I'm kidding, Chase.
[04:31:53.606 --> 04:31:54.326]  You know I love you.
[04:31:54.346 --> 04:31:55.127]  You know I love you.
[04:31:55.147 --> 04:31:55.447]  What's up?
[04:31:56.748 --> 04:31:58.689]  Bump is arriving in New Jersey right now, I'm hearing.
[04:32:01.141 --> 04:32:01.562]  Here we are.
[04:32:01.822 --> 04:32:02.362]  We're still on the phone.
[04:32:02.383 --> 04:32:03.183]  He's walking down the stairs.
[04:32:03.203 --> 04:32:03.704]  Yeah, sorry.
[04:32:03.744 --> 04:32:10.272]  Sorry, James, to cut you off, but right now on the screen we have Trump walking off of the plane, it looks like, in New Jersey.
[04:32:10.592 --> 04:32:12.535]  He appears to be even wearing the same suit.
[04:32:12.995 --> 04:32:13.736]  I don't even know.
[04:32:14.176 --> 04:32:16.479]  He must have changed, but he seems to be okay.
[04:32:16.539 --> 04:32:17.260]  What a badass.
[04:32:17.320 --> 04:32:18.702]  He's walking a lot better than Joe Biden.
[04:32:20.599 --> 04:32:21.879]  That's incredible.
[04:32:21.999 --> 04:32:26.560]  Let's take William's call after we talk to James just a little bit more because he's been on hold for 36 minutes.
[04:32:26.580 --> 04:32:30.541]  I'm sorry, it's just a crazy time to be on hold and we're going to get to as many people as we can.
[04:32:31.061 --> 04:32:33.462]  James, what you felt today is what we all felt today.
[04:32:33.502 --> 04:32:35.902]  I mean, I was at church and I had this feeling that I had to go.
[04:32:35.922 --> 04:32:39.243]  And I had to get in my car and I had to look at my phone because something was happening.
[04:32:39.823 --> 04:32:45.024]  And these things have a ripple effect, like, in the collective consciousness and the force, whatever you want to call it.
[04:32:45.605 --> 04:32:47.425]  Something big happened today.
[04:32:48.300 --> 04:32:49.461]  It's the Holy Spirit, man.
[04:32:49.721 --> 04:32:50.241]  We feel it.
[04:32:50.381 --> 04:32:51.721]  And I felt it all day as well.
[04:32:52.262 --> 04:32:55.563]  You know, and I hope, you know, I don't need to hope.
[04:32:55.803 --> 04:32:58.124]  You know, I have that much faith that we're going to win.
[04:32:58.504 --> 04:33:00.705]  We're going to be victorious as godly people.
[04:33:01.325 --> 04:33:03.326]  And, you know, I have faith.
[04:33:03.446 --> 04:33:06.287]  And, you know, these are the times when faith is very important.
[04:33:06.568 --> 04:33:08.428]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:33:08.448 --> 04:33:08.648]  All right.
[04:33:08.668 --> 04:33:09.369]  Let's go to William.
[04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.769]  William.
[04:33:09.909 --> 04:33:10.469]  Thank you, James.
[04:33:10.529 --> 04:33:11.309]  What is on your mind?
[04:33:12.530 --> 04:33:13.030]  Yes, sir.
[04:33:13.110 --> 04:33:14.911]  I'm live on the Info Wars.
[04:33:15.700 --> 04:33:16.340]  Hell yeah, you are.
[04:33:16.660 --> 04:33:18.221]  Emergency broadcast.
[04:33:18.401 --> 04:33:19.641]  My goodness, what an honor.
[04:33:20.441 --> 04:33:23.022]  And what an insane time to be alive.
[04:33:23.902 --> 04:33:26.822]  Can't say how appreciative I am that y'all are on air.
[04:33:27.062 --> 04:33:29.863]  It's just so heartwarming to know.
[04:33:29.883 --> 04:33:32.083]  And there's so many people out there.
[04:33:32.103 --> 04:33:36.944]  And, you know, Alex said, call in and say your prayers.
[04:33:37.004 --> 04:33:39.705]  And that's exactly what I wanted to do.
[04:33:39.785 --> 04:33:44.766]  So before we sign off tonight, before we go to the InfoWars store,
[04:33:45.615 --> 04:33:48.016]  I just want to say a quick prayer, so if you'd bow your heads.
[04:33:49.577 --> 04:34:03.623]  Dear God, thank you so much for just giving me the opportunity to be alive, be in this fight, and for this opportunity to wake people up and wake Trump up.
[04:34:03.643 --> 04:34:09.365]  And, you know, there's going to be some people that are hard-hearted, and that's okay, Lord.
[04:34:09.886 --> 04:34:13.847]  Their time to wake up, you know, is their time to wake up.
[04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:25.054]  That's why we all got to be your little angels and help, help wake other people up and just be a good, good light source.
[04:34:25.474 --> 04:34:30.377]  People can say, Hey, you know, these guys are controlled.
[04:34:30.397 --> 04:34:36.780]  They can really measure things and get it out clearly.
[04:34:37.260 --> 04:34:41.302]  And that's why I love them for so much, but
[04:34:42.082 --> 04:34:47.308]  God, just thanks for protecting our president, protecting our country, protecting our earth.
[04:34:47.909 --> 04:34:48.550]  Praise Jesus.
[04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:50.732]  In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[04:34:51.173 --> 04:34:51.493]  Amen.
[04:34:51.633 --> 04:34:53.215]  Beautifully said, beautiful prayer.
[04:34:53.615 --> 04:34:54.637]  We're going to cut it off here.
[04:34:54.677 --> 04:34:56.459]  I'm sorry to all the people that were on hold.
[04:34:56.959 --> 04:35:00.503]  We've taken a lot of calls, but it's late and we're going to have to cut the broadcast here.
[04:35:00.543 --> 04:35:01.845]  I just want to thank everybody again.
[04:35:02.282 --> 04:35:02.702]  Absolutely.
[04:35:02.742 --> 04:35:07.405]  And Rex, I've been trying to get you on air with me for the whole year that I've been working here.
[04:35:07.546 --> 04:35:12.889]  It's an honor, unfortunately with the circumstances, but an honor and a pleasure to be sitting behind the desk with you tonight.
[04:35:12.909 --> 04:35:14.290]  You did a fantastic job.
[04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.950]  Very impressive.
[04:35:15.371 --> 04:35:16.171]  Got it in your blood.
[04:35:16.511 --> 04:35:19.073]  It's an honor and joy to be here with you, Chase.
[04:35:19.373 --> 04:35:20.174]  Honestly.
[04:35:20.214 --> 04:35:23.036]  Like I kid earlier, but you are one of my favorite hosts.
[04:35:23.076 --> 04:35:24.377]  It's funny to say because we only have a few.
[04:35:25.317 --> 04:35:26.418]  Everybody's one of your favorites.
[04:35:26.458 --> 04:35:28.279]  Yeah, everyone's one of my favorites.
[04:35:29.219 --> 04:35:30.280]  We're all friends here.
[04:35:30.300 --> 04:35:32.821]  This is a family show, and we love you all.
[04:35:33.021 --> 04:35:33.801]  We're gonna call it here.
[04:35:34.041 --> 04:35:36.923]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, good night and good fight.
[04:35:37.183 --> 04:35:40.064]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and be the reason we are still on the air.
[04:35:43.766 --> 04:35:45.847]  If by Rudyard Kipling,
[04:35:49.159 --> 04:35:54.962]  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[04:35:55.742 --> 04:36:01.045]  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
[04:36:01.925 --> 04:36:08.028]  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies.
[04:36:08.048 --> 04:36:14.691]  Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.
[04:36:16.434 --> 04:36:19.396]  If you can dream, and not make dreams your master.
[04:36:20.037 --> 04:36:22.438]  If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
[04:36:23.219 --> 04:36:28.743]  If you can meet with triumph and disaster, and treat those two impostors just the same.
[04:36:30.023 --> 04:36:35.567]  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.
[04:36:36.208 --> 04:36:42.192]  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.
[04:36:44.321 --> 04:37:08.016]  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss And lose and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the will which says to them, hold on
[04:37:09.406 --> 04:37:15.169]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.
[04:37:15.909 --> 04:37:22.612]  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but a nun too much.
[04:37:23.773 --> 04:37:32.477]  If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[04:37:33.718 --> 04:37:37.780]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[04:37:46.198 --> 04:37:52.002]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[04:37:52.723 --> 04:37:54.404]  InfoWars.com forward slash.
[04:37:56.952 --> 04:38:02.396]  Everybody buys the Life Select storable food, which has a 25-year shelf life, just in case of an emergency.
[04:38:02.416 --> 04:38:08.539]  Frankly, it's cheaper to eat the Life Select storable food than it is to get groceries in Biden's economy.
[04:38:08.560 --> 04:38:13.042]  Then, they don't buy the Alexa Pure water filter in conjunction with the storable food.
[04:38:13.363 --> 04:38:17.625]  My thinking is, like, how are you gonna prepare the food if you don't have clean water?
[04:38:17.865 --> 04:38:18.606]  They go hand-in-hand.
[04:38:18.626 --> 04:38:19.346]  You gotta get both.
[04:38:19.366 --> 04:38:20.047]  What do you think, Jacob?
[04:38:20.287 --> 04:38:25.932]  You look at every post-apocalyptic movie in the library, the most powerful person has water.
[04:38:26.092 --> 04:38:36.362]  I'm a well driller, so we have actually a pretty sound filtration system, but I recommend to people that can't have the complex system like I have to get the electricity.
[04:38:36.602 --> 04:38:37.622]  Thank you so much for your call.
[04:38:37.682 --> 04:38:38.843]  Super important call, Jacob.
[04:38:38.863 --> 04:38:39.343]  I appreciate it.
[04:38:39.363 --> 04:38:43.664]  I encourage everyone listening now to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[04:38:43.824 --> 04:38:45.465]  Get the Life Select storable food.
[04:38:45.585 --> 04:38:52.827]  Get the Alexa Pure Water Filter as well because you want to make sure that you have the ability to prepare that food with clean, pure water.
[04:38:53.267 --> 04:38:54.567]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[04:38:54.607 --> 04:38:55.848]  Be the reason that we're still on the air.
