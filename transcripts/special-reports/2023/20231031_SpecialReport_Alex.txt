[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.783]  It's October 31st, 2023.
[00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:23.563]  It's Halloween.
[00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:30.387]  And just about two hours ago, the big third interview that Joe Rogan's done with Elon Musk dropped.
[00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:35.710]  And I took out about an hour to watch most of it.
[00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.951]  And it is a watershed event.
[00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:53.304]   My entire 29 year operation has been about exposing The largest, most powerful banks in the world's plan to take over the world and cut off the resources and kill 90% of the world population.
[00:00:54.085 --> 00:01:02.270]  Now what's incredible is it's in their documents, it's in their admissions, and now they're out in the open saying it at the UN and the World Economic Forum.
[00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:08.016]  Boris Johnson, the former head of the UK, during the pandemic said, well, it's time for old people to die.
[00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:09.757]  This is nature's way of doing it.
[00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:15.340]  They don't want to pay the pension funds in the Western world who has the oldest population in history.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.322]  The largest group of old people from Japan to Germany to the US, the UK to Canada, Australia.
[00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:37.057]   So to watch this interview and to have must say there is a mind virus incubated and developed in San Francisco of a cult of death To exterminate humans and to celebrate the end of the species completely.
[00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:39.698]  He said, I had to stand up against that.
[00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.399]  Now, obviously, I've been educating Joe about this for 25 years.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.361]  And I've told Joe over and over again, it's a death cult.
[00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:57.305]  And because I was the first on a major stage, there were others before me that did the research, to actually reach hundreds of millions of people with this message, I've been targeted for destruction.
[00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:08.507]  So I'm very glad and it's very satisfying to go through all this hell and then see the biggest show in the world, Joe Rogan, with one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk, opposing it.
[00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.290]  So this is a watershed, crossroads event.
[00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:30.487]   I said this over a decade ago, I said I'm betting on humanity, and I'm saying all these really scary things that are true, and I'm going to be demonized for saying them, but when it all starts unfolding, I'm going to have a lot of credibility, and people are going to remember what I've said, even if I've been taken off the air by then.
[00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:34.568]  Because I predicted I would be attacked, maybe even killed.
[00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.289]  And you've seen what we've gone through.
[00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.789]  So this is very paradoxical.
[00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:46.731]  Here's Elon Musk that says he's a First Amendment absolutionist, that he buys into the official reason I've been taken off Twitter, even though that isn't the reason I was taken off Twitter, Sandy Hook.
[00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:53.213]  And here he is literally quoting me word for word, and so is Joe Rogan, and no credit.
[00:02:54.193 --> 00:03:01.859]  Absolutely zero, hey Alex Jones said this, Alex Jones warned about this, Alex Jones is the archetypal populist pro-human saying it.
[00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:05.081]  But I want to be clear, that doesn't take away from how good this is.
[00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:12.546]  Because thanks to our viewers and listeners and supporters, and our army of info warriors, we have the credit for this, you have the credit for this.
[00:03:12.606 --> 00:03:14.888]  And I'm not mad at Joe, I'm not mad at Elon.
[00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:21.833]  In their view, why spoil exposing this and dampen this victory?
[00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:32.409]  By bringing me into the mix, because you see tens of thousands of articles, thousands of news reports on TV conservatively by the corporate media attacking me.
[00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:43.729]  For what's now coming out, I had to hit the barbed wire, I had to be attacked, I had to be destroyed so that others could then safely talk about it today and take the credit for it.
[00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:53.898]  And to be clear, Joe's going to be attacked for this, Elon's being attacked for this, the CIA, the Justice Department, the ADL are trying to take him off air, they've got a whole bunch of criminal investigations open.
[00:03:54.218 --> 00:04:06.369]   So this doesn't take away from the courage of Joe or Elon Musk, I just want listeners to realize The success you've had backing us and the fact that we're not just telling you this 25 years ago or 10 years ago and now it's come true.
[00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.792]  I'm telling you what's coming next and Elon hasn't gotten to that point yet.
[00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:12.473]  Elon listens.
[00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:13.374]  Joe listens.
[00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:14.195]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:16.397]  And I appreciate what they're doing.
[00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:18.618]  And I have a question to listeners and viewers.
[00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.340]  Is it time for me to hang up my spurs?
[00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:38.368]  Because it is very surreal, paradoxical, to see everything we warned about coming true, and the new Great Awakening taking place, or the Great Waking, as Musk calls it, to resist it, and then to still be relegated to the Phantom Zone.
[00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:40.985]  But I understand why Joe and Musk are doing this.
[00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:44.427]  They realize that all the demonization, all the evil was heaped on me.
[00:04:44.908 --> 00:04:45.868]  I'm a sacrificial goat.
[00:04:46.689 --> 00:05:02.919]  And so, if they recognize what Infowars has done, they take on all the attacks I went through, whereas they can now just take the success of our audience and myself, tell them the truth, and then ride in on the wave of human resistance and be popular.
[00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.000]  Which is a good thing!
[00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.440]  I want to stop nuclear war.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.761]  I want to stop the poison shots.
[00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:09.021]  I want to stop depopulation.
[00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:10.663]  I want to stop the open borders and sex trafficking.
[00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.064]  So I'm very positive about Elon Musk.
[00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:15.145]  I'm very positive about what the show's doing.
[00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:24.492]  But at the same time, if we don't celebrate the people that stood up first to this, what does that say to other people coming in the future to oppose evil?
[00:05:25.032 --> 00:05:33.698]  But I guess my just desserts and my reward is sitting back quietly and seeing our incredible success against the enemy and your success supporting us.
[00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:43.724]  So I'm not mad, but it is a little frustrating and a little weird to hear what I've said thousands of times, word for word, out of their mouths.
[00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:49.950]  And to know Joe, and be friends with Joe, and talk to Joe all the time, and Joe's getting more and more hardcore, and that's great.
[00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.655]  And to know that Musk listens to the show, and to still have Musk say, no, Alex can't come back on.
[00:05:56.275 --> 00:06:00.879]  Iranian dictators can be on Twitter, and Hamas can post footage of murdering Israelis.
[00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.341]  That's okay, because that's free speech, and that's what's going on.
[00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:04.682]  I agree with that, actually.
[00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:06.403]  We need to see the evil for itself.
[00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:10.186]  But I can't be heard, because they built this straw man.
[00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:12.288]  They've stolen my identity in corporate media.
[00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:27.255]  And they've created this fake Alex Jones, and then only at InfoWars.com, only at Bandot Video, only on my show, still reaches millions, can I sit here in my jail cell to a limited number of people and not be able to defend myself to the wider world?
[00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:29.538]  Because I don't just have the enemy's next plans.
[00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.982]  I also have a lot of ideas about an alternate future and alternate plans that we could debate and discuss.
[00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:38.263]  And I've seen Elon say we need an alternate plan for the future.
[00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:39.783]  Well, let's see it, Elon.
[00:06:40.064 --> 00:06:42.545]  Yeah, let's not depopulate.
[00:06:42.645 --> 00:06:43.705]  Let's have space exploration.
[00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:44.666]  That's all amazing.
[00:06:45.987 --> 00:06:47.828]  And so maybe, okay, Alex Jones was right.
[00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.229]  He's not the guy to be the poster boy for the resistance.
[00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:50.769]  That's fine.
[00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:57.658]   But at the same time, I need to ask the listeners then, have I completed my mission?
[00:06:58.098 --> 00:06:59.459]  Because I said this more than 20 years ago.
[00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.099]  I want to be made obsolete.
[00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.920]  I want to be made redundant.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.120]  I want to become passÃ©.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:14.243]  Because people wake up to the New World Order and that it's the dominant global corporate system with its horrible enslavement, social Darwinistic depopulation, exterminist plans.
[00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:18.244]  That's all I've wanted to do.
[00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:20.325]  Was expose that.
[00:07:21.397 --> 00:07:26.161]  And I said that when the world finally wakes up to that, because I believe in humanity, then I'll be obsolete.
[00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:28.683]  But then, am I really obsolete?
[00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:53.419]   Why am I supposed to, when I'm the most successful person exposing this, and the first person in the last 29 years to really bring this forward, from more than just tiny audiences with pamphlets and books, why then do I get relegated and demonized by Elon Musk When everybody knows on the internet, I'm the guy that first exposed it.
[00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.740]  It's very, very paradoxical.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.461]  I'm in a great mood over this.
[00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:57.661]  It's wonderful.
[00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.502]  We're going to post the full interview under me.
[00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:02.504]  I'm going to play a big excerpt from it here right now.
[00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:05.025]  Then I talk to Joe and he goes, yeah, you're right about everything.
[00:08:06.746 --> 00:08:07.526]  But you're too controversial.
[00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:23.985]   Well, I mean, if the truth's controversial, I guess that's my unique position, where I say it when it's hard to say it, I say it when it's not popular, and then when others come along, once we start winning, that's a sign of victory that they then adopted, and so I really should just celebrate and be happy.
[00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:28.929]  I mean, Mark Twain said it best, in the beginning a patriot is scarce, feared, and hated.
[00:08:30.013 --> 00:08:35.932]   and scorned. But in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing
[00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:40.653]   to be a patriot. So to me it's not about who's number one, it's not about who was first,
[00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:45.852]   except I'm barely still on air. I'm barely surviving. And then now it's the big cause
[00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:50.653]   celebs and it's out in the open and it's great and it's wonderful. And if Elon gets attacked,
[00:08:50.653 --> 00:08:55.052]   which he is, I support him, or if Joe gets attacked, I support him and then I just sit
[00:08:55.052 --> 00:09:01.293]   here twisting in the wind. It's just very strange. But in the final equation, at a deep down level,
[00:09:01.293 --> 00:09:05.692]   at a spiritual level, the bottom of my soul, the depths of my heart, the
[00:09:07.873 --> 00:09:09.454]  Most intimate parts of my brain.
[00:09:09.994 --> 00:09:11.674]  I am very blessed and honored to be in this position.
[00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:12.295]  I'm very honored.
[00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.315]  But I couldn't have done this without the listeners and viewers.
[00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:16.556]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:19.837]  I mean, we've really done a very important deed.
[00:09:20.718 --> 00:09:23.059]  We've done things that are irrevocable, that have damaged the globalists.
[00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:29.641]  So we really should just be celebrating the fact that the New World Order is out in the open and their agenda can't succeed if it's out in the open.
[00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:32.262]  So we're dealing death blows to them right now.
[00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:36.825]  It's just really, really weird that we're not getting any credit for it.
[00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:39.368]  But hey, I guess that's how it is to be a trollblazer.
[00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:43.831]  Whatever, I'll continue here at InfoWars.com every day with the weekday show and the weekend shows.
[00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:50.196]  To people that actually care and want to hear it, and people take my name off the videos, they transcript some of it, that's great.
[00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:52.178]  I actually don't even want the credit.
[00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:54.880]  It's just, again, frustrating.
[00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:56.802]  But I should celebrate.
[00:09:56.842 --> 00:09:58.123]  I'm 90% happy about it.
[00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:08.794]   It's just weird to be The guy that really, with my audience, you get the credit, that broke through with this, and then to be locked in the basement.
[00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:11.254]  But, I guess that's how it works.
[00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:13.055]  So, thank you so much for watching.
[00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:14.135]  Great job to Elon Musk.
[00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.695]  Great job to Joe.
[00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:22.717]  But as for myself and the crew, we're still here at InfoWars.com, not just currently telling you what's going on.
[00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.698]  The mainstream media lies to you about what's currently going on.
[00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:28.918]  Joe Rogan and Elon Musk tell you the truth about what's currently happening.
[00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:31.039]  We tell you the truth about what's coming next.
[00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:34.460]  I'll see you at Infowars.com forward slash show and Band Off video.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.062]  But this is a big victory for humanity because we're exposing the eugenics depopulation transhumanist death cult.
[00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:43.423]  And so I don't want this to be overshadowed by that.
[00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.764]  A lot of people ask, why don't you bitch about Elon?
[00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:46.985]  Why don't you try to take more credit?
[00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:53.087]  Well, today, when I'm being quoted word for word for 30 minutes, I mean, I will take the credit.
[00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.468]  I'll give the credit to God and our viewers and listeners.
[00:10:55.508 --> 00:11:06.275]   But there should be a larger debate about this because Again, I've got a lot of information that other people don't understand that's what's coming next, and people need to listen to stop this.
[00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:08.036]  Because I don't care about being the number one talk show host.
[00:11:08.256 --> 00:11:09.216]  I don't care about being a billionaire.
[00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:09.857]  I don't care about any of this.
[00:11:10.177 --> 00:11:12.238]  But I do want to be able to stay on air and keep warning people.
[00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:16.660]  And the only way I get out of this digital prison, this phantom zone that's InfoWars, is you.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.421]  So thank you for sharing the articles.
[00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:19.441]  Thank you for sharing the videos.
[00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:24.864]  And I'm just counting on all of you to make sure that the next part of the key transmission gets out.
[00:11:25.244 --> 00:11:26.084]  So I've done my best.
[00:11:26.304 --> 00:11:27.705]  The ball is now in your court.
[00:11:28.464 --> 00:11:36.391]  I mean, this is going to sound somewhat melodramatic, but I was worried about that it was having a corrosive effect on civilization.
[00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:41.456]  That it was just having a bad impact.
[00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:51.516]  I think part of it is that it's where it was located, which is downtown San Francisco.
[00:11:53.317 --> 00:12:08.881]  And while I think San Francisco is a beautiful city, and we should really fight hard to kind of right the ship of San Francisco, if you've walked around downtown San Francisco, right near the ex-FK Twitter headquarters, it's a zombie apocalypse.
[00:12:09.861 --> 00:12:10.441]  I mean, it's rough.
[00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.321]  Have you been in that area?
[00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:12.902]  Not lately.
[00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:13.502]  No.
[00:12:13.862 --> 00:12:14.162]  I've heard.
[00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:15.362]  It's crazy.
[00:12:15.382 --> 00:12:16.423]  I've heard it's crazy.
[00:12:16.443 --> 00:12:19.565]  I've heard you really can't believe it until you actually go there.
[00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:20.685]  You can't believe it until you go there.
[00:12:20.705 --> 00:12:24.607]  So, now you have to say, well, what philosophy led to that outcome?
[00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:27.749]  And that philosophy was being piped to Earth.
[00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:45.653]   So, you know, a philosophy that would be ordinarily quite niche and geographically constrained, so that the fallout area would be limited, was effectively given an information Yes.
[00:12:45.492 --> 00:12:52.132]   a weapon uh... information technology weapon to propagate
[00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:58.452]   uh... what is essentially a mind virus to the rest of us uh... and the outcome of that mind virus is very clear if
[00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:01.292]   you walk around the streets of downtown san francisco
[00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:07.752]   it is the end of civilization it's not just uh... propagating the mind virus but suppressing
[00:13:07.752 --> 00:13:10.052]   any opposing viewpoints
[00:13:10.052 --> 00:13:13.252]   yes well in order for the virus to propagate it must suppress opposing
[00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:15.612]  of our viewpoints.
[00:13:15.612 --> 00:13:18.052]  Because it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
[00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:18.192]  Correct.
[00:13:20.074 --> 00:13:23.898]  You've felt the virus.
[00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:24.439]  Yeah.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.002]  People have tried to cancel you so many times.
[00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:28.143]  Yeah, it's fascinating.
[00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.367]  I don't think you're melodramatic at all.
[00:13:32.163 --> 00:13:38.870]  I think it's a, I mean, I don't want to be melodramatic, but it's almost like a death cult.
[00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.791]  It's a death cult.
[00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:42.273]  No, no, that is exactly right.
[00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:45.937]  It's essentially the extinctionists.
[00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:53.724]  Like, it's in the limit, it is, they're propagating the extinction of humanity and civilization.
[00:13:55.609 --> 00:13:59.331]  And there's some people who are, like most of the time, it's implicit.
[00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:02.093]  But sometimes it's explicit.
[00:14:02.513 --> 00:14:07.576]  Like there was a guy on the front page of the New York Times who literally has the thing called the Extinctionist Movement.
[00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:13.980]  And he was quoted on the front page of the New York Times as saying, there are 8 billion people in the world, but it would be better if there were none.
[00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.642]  And I'm like, well, buddy, you can start with yourself.
[00:14:18.042 --> 00:14:18.983]  Yeah.
[00:14:19.783 --> 00:14:20.484]  Does he have friends?
[00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:22.065]  That's what always fascinates me.
[00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:24.169]  Well, here he is.
[00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.270]  It looks like you've not longed for this earth.
[00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:28.892]  I mean, he's not young.
[00:14:28.932 --> 00:14:30.712]  Voluntary human extinction movement.
[00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:32.613]  That's hilarious.
[00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:37.295]  I'd like to party with that dude.
[00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:39.956]  That's an explicit version of the death cult.
[00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:41.997]  Yeah, maybe you live long and die out.
[00:14:44.682 --> 00:14:46.283]  The Extinction is a word he uses.
[00:14:46.503 --> 00:14:46.763]  Yes.
[00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:50.985]  No, I mean, it's literally a self-description.
[00:14:51.605 --> 00:14:52.806]  Did they cover it glowingly?
[00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:55.447]  That death was in charge of social media.
[00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:55.767]  Yeah.
[00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:59.229]  And still largely is at Google and Facebook, by the way.
[00:14:59.289 --> 00:14:59.509]  Yeah.
[00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.212]  So I'm like, I'm not in favor of human extinction.
[00:15:04.931 --> 00:15:06.651]  they are and uh...
[00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:16.051]   they go to hell last year we put this book out
[00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.337]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:20.140]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.984]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:15:24.505 --> 00:15:25.386]  The Great Awakening.
[00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:29.330]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.393]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:15:31.813 --> 00:15:33.495]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:40.397]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:42.258]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:15:42.278 --> 00:15:44.358]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
