[00:00:02.418 --> 00:00:06.040]  The National Defense Authorization Act empowers the U.S.
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.742]  military to operate on American soil.
[00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:14.245]  They can arrest American citizens and cart them off to detention centers anywhere in the world.
[00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:23.530]  Basically turning the entire homeland into a battlefield and allowing the military to arrest individuals and detain them indefinitely without trial.
[00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.074]  Now this violates every aspect of a free society by denying Americans their constitutionally protected right to due process.
[00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.563]  How do you think the average American is going to respond?
[00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:45.332]  The same way they responded at the Kent State Massacre when National Guard troops were used to fire live ammunition on students who were non-violently protesting the Vietnam War.
[00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:52.955]  The military's here to defend us, not to prosecute us and arrest us and throw us in jail.
[00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:58.958]  I think it's a sneak attack by Congress and people to, you know, counter the movement on Wall Street.
[00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:04.521]  These people are saying that the passing of the bill, basically it means to them that the Rubicon has been crossed.
[00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:07.402]  That this means America will become complete.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.042]  And possibly irreversible a totalitarian military state.
[00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:15.164]  Well then our only hope is some defective armed force members.
[00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:29.092]  I think that's our only chance as the military needs to enforce our constitution and our congressmen are trampling over the rules that were established over 200 years ago and that's the whole problem.
[00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:32.974]  There's too much corruption in the executive branch and in the congressional.
[00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:39.096]  What would you say to active military who might be told to enforce this bill?
[00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:44.299]  Listen, I'm a veteran of the United States Army, 31 uniform, airborne.
[00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:51.883]  I'll tell you what, very simply we take an oath to protect this country from threats both foreign and domestic.
[00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:56.866]  It's not good, it's not healthy for our democracy, for the American Army to be involved.
[00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:02.584]  For those people who say that, oh, it could never happen here, it could never happen to us, those are called the famous last words.
[00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:09.433]  Many times throughout history, situations have happened where governments have turned their military against its citizens.
[00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:10.054]  You know what?
[00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:11.175]  History repeats itself.
[00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.879]  If that eventuality does happen,
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.404]  You have to remind yourself that these are your brothers and sisters and neighbors and people you went to school with.
[00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:24.226]  Remember what you're truly fighting for.
[00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:29.649]  It's for our Constitution, not for these puppets who are actually our servants who have run amok.
[00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:41.777]  Now, Stuart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers, recently appeared on the InfoWars Nightly News and he warned people that we are now at the point where all that will save liberty in America is another American Revolution.
[00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:46.359]  But really, you should see this as a declaration of war against the American people.
[00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.580]  That's how we should see it.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.021]  We need to stop this right now.
[00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:54.085]  If we don't, Alex, I do believe that there will be no recourse except another revolution.
[00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.006]  Otherwise, we are going to be lost.
[00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:59.088]  We will be put in the same position as the founding fathers were in 1775.
[00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.091]  I want to tell the military and police.
[00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.553]  The globalists are going to sit offshore and watch you get chewed up in a fight with the American people.
[00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:14.435]  It's very important that police and military really make a decision now which side they're going to be on.
[00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:15.856]  The military, you're right.
[00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:17.856]  Choose now whom you shall serve.
[00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:19.657]  Either you or...
[00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:22.415]  I'm talking to the military out there especially.
[00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:35.360]  Either you are a son of the Republic and you will defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, or you are a traitor to your country and you are nothing but a lowly dog, an obedient dog to the powers that be.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.061]  Choose now whom you shall serve.
[00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:54.104]  There's a lot of constitutionalists out there who are in such an uproar that they're saying that this bill places us in almost exactly the same position that our forefathers were in when they were forced to take up arms in defense of liberty back in 1775.
[00:03:55.325 --> 00:04:05.753]  Well, to those people I would say it's a culmination of things that have put us in that position and I would agree that the architects, the great and highly intelligent
[00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:18.264]  Architects that Constructed our infrastructure of the way we do business and the way we do politics and and the way we we live here in America
[00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:24.507]  They would turn over in their graves, and they would be very ashamed of us and how far we've let this go.
[00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:34.472]  Indefinite detention without due process leaves citizens without the legal protection of the Constitution, and it strikes at the very heart of the essence of U.S.
[00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:34.833]  law.
[00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:45.779]  It is positively shameful that any elected representative would even consider voting for such an assault on so sacred a fundamental value as the right to due process.
[00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.309]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
