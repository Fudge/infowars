[00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:24.638]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:30.803]  This is an InfoWars.com special report streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:32.204]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:37.528]  It is August 25th, 2011 on this Thursday edition.
[00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:44.574]  Coming up later in this special news report, we're going to break down the fact that Obama has incredibly low approval ratings.
[00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:49.378]  In fact, the lowest in modern history for a president two and a half years
[00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:50.439]  We're good.
[00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:19.788]  Steve Jobs, the owner and head of Apple, has stepped down because of health issues, and I think it's important to go back and look at the real history of Apple, not the public relations campaign that we've been fed.
[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:32.976]  Also, towards the end of this transmission, we're going to look at the latest developments in Libya, and the fact that even mainstream media admits Al Qaeda is being protected and put into power in that North African state.
[00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.717]  As a new base of operations to menace the West.
[00:01:37.057 --> 00:01:43.739]  But don't worry, Big Brother is going to be more than happy to take good care of us by taking our liberties.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:55.063]  Now, before we get to all of that news, I first want to get into a report dealing with the fact that the carbon taxes, the greenhouse taxes, are now hitting.
[00:01:55.843 --> 00:02:00.965]  It turns out that Congress won't pass a law to restrict coal power plants that
[00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:04.286]  Give more than 50% of the power to the United States.
[00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:16.970]  And so President Obama is simply using the EPA and regulators to go in and slap the new regulations that they admit will cause rolling blackouts and huge power price increases against their competition.
[00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.811]  Because you see General Electric and other insiders that are part of his administration, they're exempt.
[00:02:24.252 --> 00:02:25.312]  So let's go to that report.
[00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:36.262]  Obama hit struggling Americans with energy rate hikes following Barack Obama's vow to bankrupt the coal power industry.
[00:02:36.763 --> 00:02:46.112]  Americans are set to be hit with a wave of utility bill hikes as draconian EPA regulations drive up the cost of energy.
[00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.594]  So if somebody wants to build a coal power plant, they can.
[00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:57.098]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:16.167]  The Obama administration's crusade against coal-fired power plants, which was launched on the back of discredited junk science about hyped global warming threats, has little to do with improving the environment and everything to do with lowering living standards by creating artificial scarcity.
[00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:24.073]  The EPA has now listed as harmful carbon dioxide that is part of the life cycle of the planet.
[00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:38.744]  New EPA rules dictate that utility companies will be forced to spend an initial outlay of $800 million to conform with regulations that mandate harmful emissions be reduced under the Clean Air Act.
[00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:50.609]  And yet power plants supplied by General Electric, one of Barack Obama's biggest campaign contributors, have received an EPA waiver and will not be subject to the new regulations.
[00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.594]  The new rules will exacerbate the problem of rolling blackouts, warns Donna Nelson, head of the Texas Public Utility Commission.
[00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:08.980]  Nelson said, quote, I have no doubt in my mind that this rule will result in reliability issues and rolling outages in Texas.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:23.770]  Obama's strict enforcement of draconian EPA regulations has led to new clean-burning coal-fired plants being mothballed and other existing ones being shut down, which has in turn led to Texas and other states becoming energy-dependent.
[00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.701]  All of this, of course, will lead to significantly higher utility bills for U.S.
[00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:38.725]  citizens, who are being assaulted with more and more expenses, even as the threat of a double-dip recession lowers living standards.
[00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:50.812]  With more on these incredible developments, we're joined by InfoWars.com reporter Darren McBreen in downtown Austin.
[00:04:55.985 --> 00:05:11.244]  I'm Darren McBreen with InfoWars Nightly News and I'm here today at the Texas State Capitol and we're about to find out if the people of Austin are aware that they are about to be hit by a wave of utility bill hikes as new EPA regulations drive up the cost of energy.
[00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:17.847]  What do you think about paying higher utility bills because of the EPA's new regulations against power plants?
[00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:33.618]  You know, there may be some new regulations coming up against power plants at this point, but unfortunately right now I think that our citizens statewide and nationwide are basically overburdened, especially with today's economic developments and situations that are going on.
[00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:41.524]  I think rate hikes should be at a minimal to at least try to alleviate some of the burden on our taxpayers and our citizens nationwide and statewide.
[00:05:41.798 --> 00:05:46.123]  I know a lot of people that are going to be not only shocked but a little bit irritated about that as well.
[00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:51.309]  Because it's such a hot summer, everybody's bills are already up through the roof.
[00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:01.982]  You're already paying through the roof because the ACs are running non-stop and then all of a sudden it's like, on top of that and with a downturn economy, yeah, it doesn't seem to jive that well.
[00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:04.575]  Of course I don't want to pay higher utility bills.
[00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:07.937]  They're already extremely high right now as it is.
[00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:12.180]  Well I don't want to pay more because of the carbon dioxide thing.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.080]  That doesn't seem right.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.681]  Especially if it's not even proven.
[00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:17.884]  Generally I prefer regulations that
[00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:24.000]  That deter pollution, and paying a little bit more for that, in an unregulated environment.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.701]  It all has to be regulated some way, right?
[00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:28.782]  It's gonna mess our environment up.
[00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:35.844]  I understand the tax on carbon footprints, but I mean, who's, who's, you know, getting a new Lexus, you know what I mean?
[00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:38.824]  Do you think that carbon dioxide is dangerous?
[00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:43.546]  I think carbon dioxide can be very dangerous.
[00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.026]  Okay, what do plants breathe?
[00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:48.267]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:51.836]  Yeah, I think carbon dioxide is definitely dangerous.
[00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:58.782]  Otherwise there wouldn't be any, like, rules and laws to prevent it being... What do plants breathe?
[00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:01.084]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.006]  Carbon dioxide is turned into oxygen by plants.
[00:07:05.447 --> 00:07:05.908]  So, I mean...
[00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:09.151]  We're... I mean, it has to be in the world.
[00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:11.393]  Obviously, it's not all dangerous.
[00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:16.518]  Carbon dioxide isn't a dangerous gas, but when there's too much of it, it's a problem.
[00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:26.569]  Carbon dioxide, even though it's a natural gas consumed by plants, can be dangerous because, well, everyone says it has to do with global warming.
[00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:29.470]  Behind me is the Holly Street Power Plant.
[00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.371]  It was partially closed in 2004 and officially shut down in 2007.
[00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:38.633]  Now it's simply a reminder of Austin's energy independence.
[00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:46.716]  What do you think about the fact that General Electric, one of Obama's biggest donors, that they get a waiver and they will not be subject to the regulations?
[00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:48.576]  That sounds like politics and lobbyists' web work.
[00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:49.937]  I mean, it's government, right?
[00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:51.337]  No surprise.
[00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:51.737]  Sounds plausible.
[00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:52.838]  Yeah, it sounds plausible.
[00:07:52.858 --> 00:07:53.778]  There's no surprise about that.
[00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:56.420]  General Electric doesn't need any favors from anybody.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.381]  They're a multi-billion dollar corporation.
[00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:06.287]  Are you aware that some of these new regulations are also shutting down power plants and this is causing some of the rolling blackouts throughout Texas?
[00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:08.089]  No, I wasn't familiar with that actually.
[00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:09.610]  I didn't realize that was going on.
[00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.192]  Lobbyists make a lot of money making striking these deals.
[00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:13.973]  There's a lot of things that we don't know.
[00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:19.157]  And how government, you know, the tax breaks, the incentives, loopholes, you name it.
[00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:21.159]  So I think it's just one more to add to the list.
[00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:30.063]  Well, as you can see, Alex, the people here in Austin, they're aware that their utility rates are going up, but they're not sure of the real cause.
[00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:33.645]  This is Darren McBrain with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:35.346]  All right, thank you, Darren.
[00:08:36.647 --> 00:08:37.067]  Wow!
[00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:39.829]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:45.452]  We're going to do some other pieces here in Austin, where we're going to go out and say, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:46.713]  We've done them before, years ago.
[00:08:47.353 --> 00:08:50.095]  And over 90% of people say, yeah, ban it right now.
[00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:56.635]  And even after you tell them that dihydrogen monoxide is water, they still say ban it.
[00:08:57.416 --> 00:09:00.157]  If the government says it, it must be reasonable.
[00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:02.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've done ice core samples.
[00:09:02.898 --> 00:09:09.201]  In the last 200,000 years, we've had 14 times higher carbon dioxide than we have right now.
[00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:14.023]  The truth is, they've done studies, if carbon dioxide was doubled, the Sahara would be a jungle.
[00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:19.045]  We are in a carbon dioxide starve situation.
[00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:26.814]  And the globalists have chosen carbon dioxide, part of the life cycle, part of the carbon cycle, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sunlight and water.
[00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:28.315]  You got to have those four things.
[00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.458]  So they can tax breathing.
[00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:33.821]  I saw a New York Times article years ago saying, yes, we're going to tax breathing.
[00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.902]  You'll pay your money to Al Gore.
[00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:35.303]  It's good.
[00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:49.597]  I'm sorry, there's a lot of real environmental issues I'm concerned about, like Fukushima still melting down, belching radiation, or genetic engineering splicing spiders and goats, or my corn having pesticide put into it.
[00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.538]  I personally, I've had enough.
[00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.379]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this special report is just getting started.
[00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:01.801]  We're going to come back from break and get into the latest on Obama's plunging poll numbers.
[00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:11.408]  Ron Paul's exploding poll numbers, and we'll talk to Ron Paul's former Chief of Staff, no other than Lou Rockwell, on the other side.
[00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:12.711]  Please stay with us.
[00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:13.793]  It's InfoWars.
[00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:14.534]  Special Report.
[00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:19.257]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:10:19.658 --> 00:10:20.878]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:29.601]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place against the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:33.202]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:34.343]  But take heart.
[00:10:34.543 --> 00:10:38.024]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:43.306]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:47.308]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:48.970]  The globalists are scared.
[00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.290]  They've overreached.
[00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:53.753]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.629]  We are going to use their system against them.
[00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:14.613]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:38.450]  Coming up, we're going to be looking at the latest developments in North Africa, Libya, Tripoli, Gaddafi's latest defiant threats against the West, and the fact that our new ally is Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:42.273]  But first, I wanted to talk about President Obama.
[00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:51.660]  President Obama was sold as this outsider, a guy that was going to get the job done, end the war, stop the torture, and deal with those pesky central bankers.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.161]  Well, since he's gotten in,
[00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:57.360]  I've learned that lo and behold he works for who?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.640]  Financing!
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.301]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America.
[00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:03.262]  He's their man.
[00:12:03.862 --> 00:12:05.462]  And the American people have woken up to him.
[00:12:06.043 --> 00:12:11.264]  He now has the lowest approval rating of any president two and a half years into their first term.
[00:12:12.104 --> 00:12:13.365]  So what is the system doing?
[00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:19.547]  Well, they've got Rick Perry coming out saying he wants to get rid of the Fed and trying to sound like Ron Paul.
[00:12:20.247 --> 00:12:28.531]  But if you look at the different Gallup polls that are out there, it is Ron Paul that trails Obama if the election was held today, the 2012 election,
[00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:30.251]  It was held today.
[00:12:30.652 --> 00:12:33.133]  Ron Paul is only one point behind him.
[00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:38.115]  Ron Paul does the best with Democrats, progressives and others.
[00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:41.697]  And Perry is trailing Obama by three points.
[00:12:41.797 --> 00:12:45.459]  So this new world order puppet, Barack Obama,
[00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:46.059]  I think so.
[00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:18.018]  On all things Ron Paul and how America can get behind this true constitutionalist is the editor-in-chief of LewRockwell.com, none other than Lew Rockwell, who also of course served as Ron Paul's chief of staff.
[00:13:18.078 --> 00:13:24.743]  So, it doesn't get any better than Ron Paul, but if there has to be a second brightest spot in the universe, it's Lew Rockwell.
[00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:26.484]  Lew, thank you for joining us tonight.
[00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:28.066]  Alex, great to be with you.
[00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:31.573]  So much is happening out of the gates.
[00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:33.593]  Can Ron Paul win?
[00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:35.474]  Yeah, Ron Paul can win.
[00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:47.977]  And in fact, the fear that the media is exhibiting by first trying to put the blackout on him, then of course demonizing him and then blacking him out, shows that they are very afraid.
[00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.396]  He's talking about issues that are resonating with the American people as never before.
[00:13:52.836 --> 00:14:01.809]  Issues that threaten the establishment, everything from the Pentagon to the CIA to the Federal Reserve to the bankocracy and all the rest of the power elite in Washington.
[00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:03.231]  They're being threatened.
[00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:04.172]  They're worried.
[00:14:04.728 --> 00:14:16.394]  And they wouldn't be paying, you know, they wouldn't be saying anything about Ron Paul, Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, all the rest of these people, would not be denouncing him if he didn't threaten the apparatus that they're part of.
[00:14:16.894 --> 00:14:31.421]  So, he can win, and as you say, he's moving up in the polls, he's moving up slowly, but he's moving up organically, he's getting more and more people, young people especially, but people of all ages, in all different states, not only in this country, but around the world,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.562]  People are Ron Paulians in every country, so this is an international movement.
[00:14:37.422 --> 00:14:42.944]  It bodes so well for the American future, as we face, of course, terrible economic and other kinds of troubles.
[00:14:43.364 --> 00:14:46.725]  But this is the bright spot in America today, is the Ron Paul movement.
[00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:52.978]  And of course, I was being somewhat sarcastic and devil's advocate when I said, can he win?
[00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:56.060]  I mean, in every poll, he's in the top three candidates.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.082]  New Gallup poll out today shows him in third place.
[00:15:00.102 --> 00:15:01.843]  Some have shown him in second place.
[00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:03.544]  Others in first place.
[00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:06.946]  And it's this mantra of telling the public he can't win.
[00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:10.748]  I'm sure you saw that Pure Research piece that Pew put out.
[00:15:11.568 --> 00:15:20.811]  Last week, showing that indeed, Ron Paul has gotten less coverage than any other candidate, and most of the coverage has been negative.
[00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:22.432]  Well, that right there is an endorsement.
[00:15:22.792 --> 00:15:29.775]  If Limbaugh's saying he'll destroy the Republican Party, I saw what you wrote, well, you know, good if it destroys the official Republican Party.
[00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:30.835]  Yeah, that'd be good news.
[00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:36.419]  Yeah, so that's the proof right there that the whole establishment is coming after him.
[00:15:36.439 --> 00:15:41.442]  I mean, that's the proof right there that he's the man for the job, not just his long record of being a constitutionalist.
[00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:43.684]  Well, as we know, George H.W.
[00:15:43.724 --> 00:15:46.245]  Bush refers to Rush Limbaugh as our boy.
[00:15:46.726 --> 00:15:53.670]  And indeed he is, you know, he is part of that, the Bush establishment, country club, Republican apparatus.
[00:15:54.671 --> 00:16:00.455]  But the more that people get to know Ron, I believe, by the way, the media stuff is backfiring on them.
[00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:06.818]  Because people who are paying attention realize just how unfair this is, and they want to know, well, why is he being targeted?
[00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:17.531]  So once they look at Ron, once they see his YouTubes, of course, where they saw him in person, when they read his articles, read his books, this is the most learned guy running for president
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.681]  In a very, very long time.
[00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:21.101]  Maybe we have to go back to Jefferson.
[00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:22.422]  I mean, he's so well-read.
[00:16:22.442 --> 00:16:23.582]  He understands economics.
[00:16:23.622 --> 00:16:24.662]  He understands history.
[00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:27.323]  He understands everything about what's going on in this country.
[00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:32.825]  He's so much smarter than Rick Perry, Bachmann, Romney, the rest of these guys.
[00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:35.266]  He just is intellectually head and shoulders above them.
[00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.767]  Of course, in character, too.
[00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.848]  And as people get to know him, they flock to him.
[00:16:40.288 --> 00:16:43.329]  So, it's quite an extraordinary moment in American history.
[00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:50.839]  And I think it's why we have to be fundamentally optimistic because so many young people have just had it with the system.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.442]  They know there's a problem.
[00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:58.691]  I just saw a wonderful YouTube put together by some kids last night where it's people all over the country
[00:16:59.249 --> 00:17:01.311]  Saying, you know, we know there's a problem.
[00:17:01.351 --> 00:17:03.272]  We don't believe what the government is saying.
[00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:04.914]  We don't believe what the media is saying.
[00:17:05.354 --> 00:17:07.196]  Only Ron Paul is telling us the truth.
[00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.678]  And so, you know, we need to change.
[00:17:09.718 --> 00:17:10.478]  We need some hope.
[00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.020]  Not like Obama.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.384]  We don't need any more bankocracy, the two-party bankocracy of the Democrats and the Republicans.
[00:17:17.644 --> 00:17:18.585]  We need something different.
[00:17:19.026 --> 00:17:26.392]  So Ron Paul is, again, he's scaring the pants off the establishment, and that's very good news.
[00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:51.349]  Well I agree with you and just about a week ago the Daily Show came out and really pointed out that there was a open campaign to ignore Ron Paul or they were forced to cover him say well he can't win and since the dam is broken on the attempt to cover up Ron Paul and since it backfired I now see them shifting gears and
[00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:55.192]  I fear that we're going to see Aqua Buddha attempts.
[00:17:55.652 --> 00:17:59.255]  We're going to hear that Ron Paul assassinated Lincoln.
[00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:02.499]  We're going to hear that he blew up the Lusitania that he started.
[00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:05.742]  Well, that he crucified Christ.
[00:18:05.802 --> 00:18:08.644]  But I saw that again backfire when they tried it on Rand.
[00:18:09.065 --> 00:18:14.590]  What's your political instinct, Lew, on the next way they're going to try to go after Ron Paul?
[00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.232]  And will it be effective?
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.201]  I don't think it'll be effective.
[00:18:18.221 --> 00:18:23.863]  Of course, it's the old Gandhi line about, you know, first they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:18:24.424 --> 00:18:37.650]  So it's a, this is just going along with what they usually do, but as we know from polls, as we know from everybody that we talk to ourselves, and you're especially in touch with so many people, nobody trusts the mainstream media.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.501]  Nobody believes them.
[00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:49.705]  The new media, like the Alex Jones Show, people have trust in, but nobody trusts NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and the rest of these, at least not most Americans don't.
[00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:54.607]  So when they see these people going after somebody, it makes them ask, what's right about him?
[00:18:55.167 --> 00:19:07.652]  So again, all you have to do is direct people to Ron, to his YouTubes, his writings, his website, and the website's about him, and people love him, and they have hope.
[00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.756]  And they no longer feel, not that Ron is giving us any soft soap.
[00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:19.603]  We know we've got serious economic troubles, very serious economic troubles and other sorts of troubles ahead.
[00:19:20.023 --> 00:19:23.407]  But as Ron explains to us, we can have a way out of it.
[00:19:23.687 --> 00:19:24.949]  There is a way out of it.
[00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.710]  We don't have to have this forever.
[00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:35.734]  There is a path to economic growth, to prosperity, to human flourishing, against all the people who, of course, are against human flourishing.
[00:19:35.754 --> 00:19:41.456]  The warmongers, the money counterfeiters, the bankers, and all the rest of the power elite.
[00:19:41.976 --> 00:19:45.338]  So, they're going to smear him.
[00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:46.619]  They're going to libel him.
[00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:48.259]  They're going to toss mud at him.
[00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:52.201]  But, you know, they talked about Reagan being the Teflon candidate.
[00:19:52.628 --> 00:19:58.292]  Actually, Ron Paul's a Teflon candidate, not because the stuff just doesn't stick to him.
[00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:11.320]  And it's because when people look at him, I remember in a previous congressional election where his opponent said he's against the drug war, he wants heroin dispensaries at the public schools, at the elementary schools, so the kids can take heroin.
[00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:14.622]  Well, of course, nobody believes that stuff.
[00:20:15.063 --> 00:20:19.225]  They look at Ron Paul, they listen to him, they get a sense of the kind of man he is.
[00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:21.367]  Now, you don't get that from any kind of politician.
[00:20:22.147 --> 00:20:25.049]  A regular politician, maybe you just think he's a slippery guy.
[00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:34.694]  People listen to Ron Paul and they think, well, you know, this is a wise man, this is a man who knows, this is a man who's brilliant, and who's actually got hope for the future.
[00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:39.096]  So I think the campaign is not going to work.
[00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:42.297]  Again, it's going to backfire, just like the blackout backfired.
[00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:47.400]  More and more Americans, you know, the more they examine Bachmann,
[00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:54.350]  Or Perry, or Romney, or Chris Christie, or Palin, or any of those other people they're talking about, let alone Jeb Bush.
[00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.030]  I mean, the other people they're talking about maybe getting in the race.
[00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:58.211]  They're all pygmies.
[00:20:58.711 --> 00:21:04.132]  They're moral pygmies, they're intellectual pygmies, against a very great man, Ron Paul.
[00:21:04.312 --> 00:21:06.153]  Well, they're undoubtedly political hacks.
[00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:19.820]  I mean, they're just complete political fake creatures who constantly flip-flop, and I don't want to dwell too long on this, but Rick Perry, who pledged not to run, of course broke the pledge, was all about piquing interest in the reluctant hero.
[00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:27.007]  He's a guy for forced inoculations, NAFTA superhighways, Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas,
[00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:30.549]  And this, now the media is saying, is the frontrunner.
[00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:39.893]  And I just say, shame on America if you go for another Obama type, another Rick Perry, another packaged plastic Ken doll, if they don't choose Ron Paul.
[00:21:39.913 --> 00:21:46.756]  But briefly, your take on Rick Perry, and then the fact that Ron Paul is really the man of the hour.
[00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:57.240]  He predicted with precision, along with you and others, exactly what would happen with the inflation tax and so much more, and your view on the upcoming death of the dollar.
[00:21:58.322 --> 00:22:00.926]  Well, I think, first of all, as to Rick Perry, there are many things to say about him.
[00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:06.434]  To me, the key thing that stands out in my mind is the fact that in Texas he's known as Gardasil Rick.
[00:22:06.835 --> 00:22:14.006]  And that's because he took money from the Merck drug company, as did the Republican Party of Texas and all the Republican politicians down there.
[00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:21.431]  To force a very dangerous and untested HPV vaccine on every sixth grade girl in public school in Texas.
[00:22:21.832 --> 00:22:43.028]  The fact that this man, you know, talks about the Obama mandate, the fact that this guy would have used government force, and of course a huge rip-off for Merck, I mean, hundreds of dollars per shot, these girls had to have multiple shots, causing so many illnesses, happened in England too, the fact that this guy would have used the power of the governorship in return for bribes,
[00:22:43.468 --> 00:22:49.213]  Maybe they're legal bribes, or they're still bribes, to force this dangerous vaccine on little girls.
[00:22:49.613 --> 00:22:50.454]  What a criminal!
[00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:51.495]  What a monster!
[00:22:51.875 --> 00:23:04.006]  I mean, Rick Perry... I mean, all these politicians, of course, are criminals and monsters, the regular politicians, but Perry really stands out as, it seems to me, a first-class creep, a totalitarian, as you say.
[00:23:04.704 --> 00:23:07.246]  Trans-Texas Highwayman, all the various things he's done.
[00:23:07.506 --> 00:23:16.274]  This guy is just... I'm not worried at all about Perry, because as the word gets out about who he really is, he's going to go nowhere.
[00:23:16.655 --> 00:23:19.197]  I don't think Americans are ready for another George W. Bush.
[00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.509]  And he's just, he's another clown like Bush.
[00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.934]  But he's trying to become Ron Paul, saying that the Federal Reserve is almost treasonous.
[00:23:27.974 --> 00:23:30.456]  Well, no, it's a private offshore corporation.
[00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:31.938]  It's looking out for itself.
[00:23:32.378 --> 00:23:33.359]  How is that treasonous?
[00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:37.983]  Isn't it really treasonous that Congress and others have let them do this to our country?
[00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.884]  And he's trying to become Ron Paul.
[00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:46.230]  And I think it shows how powerful the message of liberty is that you and others and Ron Paul have been real standard-bearers for.
[00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.130]  We're good to go.
[00:24:01.468 --> 00:24:04.551]  Job number one, I think, is to expose the Rick Perry hoax.
[00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:14.761]  Well, I think that's right, but you know what, as you say, it is a tribute to Ron that he feels, correctly so, that by denouncing the Federal Reserve and denouncing Ben Bernanke, it's good politics.
[00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:23.389]  So this is because, Ron, you know, I've been interested in the Fed for a very long time, and I can tell you people's eyes would glaze over when you tried to discuss it.
[00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.611]  Ron Paul made the Fed interesting.
[00:24:26.052 --> 00:24:30.475]  He made Americans aware that we're being ripped off by the Federal Reserve and its associated banks.
[00:24:31.075 --> 00:24:38.159]  And so that the establishment said, well, Rick Perry really damaged himself when he said that about Bernanke and the Fed.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.540]  Actually, he didn't, of course.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.401]  He helped himself.
[00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.102]  But he is a fake.
[00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:43.163]  He's a phony.
[00:24:43.543 --> 00:24:45.124]  He's trying to steal Ron Paul's thunder.
[00:24:45.144 --> 00:24:46.605]  But I think it's not going to work.
[00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:48.806]  Ron Paul is the real deal.
[00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:52.028]  And as I can testify myself for having worked
[00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:52.871]  I think so.
[00:25:15.683 --> 00:25:19.704]  And they are bringing about, of course, as you pointed out, the death of the dollar.
[00:25:20.845 --> 00:25:36.269]  We face, it's a horror, we don't know the timing, and the dollar is going to be strengthened probably by all the continuing troubles that the banks are giving the European countries and destroying the euro.
[00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:39.170]  But we're going to see much higher inflation here.
[00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.871]  It's going to be horrific, probably going to be worse than the 1970s.
[00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:47.011]  But again, we don't have to have that permanently.
[00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.475]  We don't have to have a counterfeiting board in Washington, D.C.
[00:25:51.815 --> 00:25:56.579]  ripping off regular people for the benefit of Wall Street and the big banks and the government itself.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.201]  So, we don't have to have all these wars.
[00:25:59.562 --> 00:26:00.222]  What are they fighting?
[00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:07.788]  Six or seven wars and, of course, secret wars and just wading knee-deep in blood all over the world.
[00:26:08.749 --> 00:26:09.770]  Other countries resent it.
[00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.471]  Americans ought to resent it.
[00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:13.293]  Ron Paul is talking about
[00:26:14.017 --> 00:26:20.819]  Really, the most important issue, even more important than the money issue, and it's hard to think of anything that is, except the one issue of war and peace.
[00:26:21.379 --> 00:26:27.501]  So, no more wars, bring the troops home, stop the counterfeiting, cut government spending.
[00:26:27.841 --> 00:26:28.841]  It can be done.
[00:26:29.062 --> 00:26:34.003]  And I know that people have questioned, well, if Ron Paul were elected, the Congress would never go along with him.
[00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:37.124]  But all I can say is, if Ron Paul were to be elected,
[00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:47.278]  And the kind of mandate he would have, all those congressmen who care about being elected more than anything else and being re-elected, would be asking Dr. Paul, what do we do?
[00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:48.358]  Absolutely!
[00:26:48.618 --> 00:27:01.203]  The whole country would be in the mood for big changes, I hate to use Roosevelt's phrase, but an actual new deal, a new deal for the American people, a new deal of freedom, a new deal of prosperity, a Ron Paul new deal.
[00:27:02.347 --> 00:27:02.987]  Absolutely.
[00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:07.730]  And just 15, 20 years ago, he couldn't get one co-sponsor to audit the Fed.
[00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.211]  It passed the House, as you know, last year.
[00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:13.352]  And with Ron Paul as president, they would have a lot of trouble.
[00:27:14.593 --> 00:27:18.135]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come, as the French philosopher
[00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:28.618]  Victor Hugo said, and after decades of laboring out there in the wilderness, Lou, you and others that deserve so much credit, our time is coming.
[00:27:29.278 --> 00:27:31.439]  Liberty is approaching.
[00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:37.000]  And even if Ron Paul doesn't win this round, he certainly wins by injecting real issues.
[00:27:37.601 --> 00:27:38.981]  And freedom is popular.
[00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:43.884]  And we need to legalize freedom as Ron Paul and as you have said.
[00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:46.125]  Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com.
[00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:54.050]  I'll continue to track all the amazing research and reports you put out and also the work you do over at the Von Mies Institute that you founded and head up.
[00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.151]  Lew Rockwell, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:57.852]  Alex, thank you so much.
[00:27:58.717 --> 00:28:02.738]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:28:03.158 --> 00:28:04.359]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:13.101]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place against the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:16.682]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:28:16.982 --> 00:28:17.822]  But take heart.
[00:28:18.002 --> 00:28:21.543]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:28:21.824 --> 00:28:26.785]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:28:27.225 --> 00:28:30.827]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:32.448]  The globalists are scared.
[00:28:32.768 --> 00:28:33.788]  They've overreached.
[00:28:34.128 --> 00:28:37.250]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:28:46.054 --> 00:28:49.476]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook,
[00:28:49.696 --> 00:28:50.478]  We're good to go.
[00:29:08.854 --> 00:29:16.444]  Coming up, we've got a special report on the news behind the news, the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say, in Libya.
[00:29:16.524 --> 00:29:18.066]  But first, the rest of the news.
[00:29:18.607 --> 00:29:19.888]  The police state news.
[00:29:20.848 --> 00:29:35.632]  You know, yesterday, the CEO and main owner of Apple Computers, Steve Jobs, came out and said, hey, I've got health problems, and if they ever got too bad for me to continue my chairmanship, I'm going to leave.
[00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:38.793]  And so he's basically made that announcement.
[00:29:39.293 --> 00:29:48.936]  And then I watched the mainstream corporate whore media engage in a love fest about how humanitarian he is, how great he is, and how he cares so much about everybody.
[00:29:49.776 --> 00:30:04.481]  And I just want to say to Steve Jobs, you may be this big Zen Buddha we've heard about all day, but I saw your company put out a lot of PR propaganda concerning the fact that the factories that you control in China have record suicides at them.
[00:30:05.121 --> 00:30:10.203]  In fact, hundreds of times the average that we see in other Chinese or even U.S.
[00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:10.663]  factories.
[00:30:11.451 --> 00:30:14.152]  And so that's something you guys need to answer for.
[00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:24.134]  Also, you have Al Gore on your board, who has palatial mansions all over the world and all these jet aircraft, who lectures the general public they shouldn't be able to take hot baths.
[00:30:24.814 --> 00:30:37.838]  And so you guys are always pushing carbon taxes while you're responsible for absolutely huge carbon outputs of the devil gas carbon dioxide generated from your server farms, which
[00:30:38.812 --> 00:30:39.834]  Again, I'm not concerned.
[00:30:40.175 --> 00:30:42.358]  The plants are really hungry for that carbon dioxide.
[00:30:43.521 --> 00:30:44.001]  But you...
[00:30:45.362 --> 00:30:46.543]  Say it's horrible and evil.
[00:30:47.223 --> 00:30:59.031]  And so before you prepare to leave this world and cross to the River Styx and give Charon his piece of gold, wouldn't you like to actually become the humanitarian that you've always claimed you are?
[00:30:59.592 --> 00:31:14.962]  I mean, I get really sick of the eugenicist globalists pushing the case to kill Granny Bill Gates and your other cohorts that came out of the same NSA, IBM nest lecturing us all day from the West Coast.
[00:31:15.722 --> 00:31:17.223]  And Silicon Valley.
[00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:40.778]  I mean, we're going to file a special report dealing with this later next week, but just look at the co-founder of Apple who told major newspapers that he basically supports a transhumanist view of the world and that the human race is destined to become a little more than house pets.
[00:31:42.327 --> 00:31:50.032]  You are the people selling this view that humans should just give up to your machines and give up our humanity because it's not worth anything.
[00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:56.796]  Well, if we're worthless, like the Chinese workers you've got to put nets outside for, because they're committing suicide by the hundreds.
[00:31:57.136 --> 00:32:04.901]  If we are so worthless, then don't grandstand and tell us we're worth something when we buy your trendy, fancy, shiny objects.
[00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:11.386]  I mean, of all of these devices that are doing the programming, we're not programming the machines, they're now programming us.
[00:32:11.807 --> 00:32:13.989]  Yours are some of the prettiest baubles.
[00:32:14.109 --> 00:32:24.558]  But again, as you approach the event horizon, I beg of you to simply look destiny and eternity in the mirror and actually do something good.
[00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:25.820]  What's the solution?
[00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:49.792]  If Apple, the biggest corporation in the world, arguably, after ExxonMobil, came out and said, hey, we are going to charge a few dollars more for our iPhones and iPads and the rest of it, or maybe take a few dollars less in profit to certify and seal on our Chinese-made products that it was a living wage.
[00:32:50.865 --> 00:33:03.369]  I was reading where some of these workers have to chain their children up to power poles down the street every day and they sit there starving and defecating on themselves while the parents hope to get enough money to hopefully feed them that night.
[00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:16.254]  I think with all your tens of billions that you could shut up and stop acting like you're a good little socialist and lecturing us all day about carbon taxes and have a move to certify that your products are human friendly.
[00:33:16.914 --> 00:33:19.697]  You know, like on the back of the shampoos saying, animal-friendly.
[00:33:20.117 --> 00:33:21.299]  Animals weren't tested on.
[00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:23.040]  What about Chinese slaves?
[00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:24.742]  Were they tested on?
[00:33:25.083 --> 00:33:26.644]  Where'd you get that liver, Steve?
[00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:29.447]  That's the type of stuff I'm talking about here, okay?
[00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:36.094]  So before you make that jump into hyperspace, you need to decide, is it going to be down there, or is it going to be up there?
[00:33:37.175 --> 00:33:38.276]  And are there atheists?
[00:33:39.235 --> 00:33:39.936]  In foxholes.
[00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:13.990]  Well, get a little angel on your shoulder and maybe give you an alternative.
[00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:20.073]  That was my pontification for the evening, and it was quite lengthy.
[00:34:20.513 --> 00:34:24.734]  That's why this is a special report, not the news show, premiering next Thursday, 7 p.m.
[00:34:24.754 --> 00:34:26.935]  Central, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:37.379]  We're seeing a lot of police state news out there, and, well, Big Sis, you know her, the jack-booted gentleman, who was the former governor of Arizona.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:43.502]  Well, Big Sis gives green light for drone that tazes suspects from above.
[00:34:44.142 --> 00:34:50.664]  And it's got shotgun mounts, taser mounts, why it can do whatever you need it to do.
[00:34:51.125 --> 00:35:00.208]  And they're putting out all these great promotional videos showing them chasing the evil people that aren't submitting to the global system.
[00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:03.069]  And see, here's my issue with this.
[00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:14.997]  There's this giant arms buildup with our tax money in the United States and other Western countries to give the latest high-tech gadgets to the police who are just dying to try them out on us.
[00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:20.981]  And I've seen all the deaths from tasers and people being tortured with them for asking cops directions.
[00:35:21.581 --> 00:35:22.262]  And I ask us,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.722]  I ask the public, is this something you want to be part of?
[00:35:27.843 --> 00:35:29.804]  Is this something you want to support?
[00:35:30.164 --> 00:35:32.506]  Were you given a memo on this as a taxpayer?
[00:35:33.106 --> 00:35:35.968]  To have these drones chasing you around on the streets?
[00:35:37.432 --> 00:35:47.418]  I remember IBM a decade ago funding the Digital Angel and seeing the Mexican Attorney General come out and say, I'm making my employees take these implantable chips.
[00:35:47.878 --> 00:35:51.820]  Well, now hospitals are pushing these on people and parents are being told in the U.S.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.561]  it's a great thing.
[00:35:53.181 --> 00:36:03.607]  And I saw a report that tens of thousands of people in Mexico and in other areas south of Mexico and Latin America are taking these in the name of protecting themselves from kidnapping.
[00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:09.552]  So we see more and more the mainlining of these police state type control grids.
[00:36:10.192 --> 00:36:19.918]  And finally in police state news tonight, Natural News and Mike Adams have learned more about the Rossum food raids and other raids against dairies across the country.
[00:36:20.538 --> 00:36:41.457]  It turns out that just like in the raids against Amish that lasted in some cases over a year and spent more than a million dollars, they send in government agents posing as health food conscious people to set up the Amish and others to beg them, in some cases for months, to sell them some raw healthy milk.
[00:36:42.412 --> 00:36:55.117]  Then the police stage a SWAT team raid on the Amish and other groups so they can then show the armed raid to jurors and say, look, we wouldn't SWAT team somebody if they weren't a hardened criminal, put them in jail.
[00:36:55.477 --> 00:37:09.102]  Some of these people are facing multi-hundred thousand dollar bonds for the crime of producing and selling fresh raw milk cheeses that you can still buy at Whole Foods and other mainline stores for a limited time.
[00:37:09.722 --> 00:37:16.532]  So the police state isn't worried about the big banksters and their tens of trillions stolen of taxpayer money or the derivative scam.
[00:37:16.852 --> 00:37:25.023]  They're worried about people nationwide selling eggs, tomatoes, squash, and yes, raw, real milk to the population.
[00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:31.571]  Now in some interesting news that isn't as depressing, we have a report here out of Reuters.
[00:37:32.111 --> 00:37:35.254]  Astronomers discover a planet made of diamond.
[00:37:35.574 --> 00:37:43.340]  They've got radio telescopes that at hundreds and hundreds of light years away, in some cases thousands, can actually, with a spectrograph,
[00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:46.862]  Now coming back to a place a little closer, our little planet,
[00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:21.572]  Third rock from the sun here in the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy to a place in North Africa where a dictator for 42 years has controlled the nation.
[00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:25.013]  And he's being exchanged for another dictator.
[00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:33.755]  But this new dictatorship is the plutocratic offshore central banks that are now admitting that six months ago
[00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:37.082]  A month and a half before the U.N.
[00:38:37.122 --> 00:38:38.303]  resolution or the U.S.
[00:38:38.343 --> 00:38:54.850]  got involved in this new war that we were told wasn't a war and it was a kinetic military action, a month and a half before that was even announced to the world and Obama told us it would last days, not weeks, we are now told that yes, indeed,
[00:38:56.909 --> 00:38:57.169]  U.S.
[00:38:57.189 --> 00:39:03.414]  Special Forces, British Special Forces, NATO Special Forces were involved from the beginning.
[00:39:03.735 --> 00:39:09.179]  So it wasn't an organic uprising of the Libyan people against Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:19.628]  No, it was Western Special Forces going in to the east of the country and being armed over the border from the nation of Libya.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:34.408]  Egypt, and that those armed rebels tried to overthrow the government, and when Gaddafi resisted it, and resisted the Al Qaeda forces, that's who they admit they are, the world was told he was attacking peaceful demonstrators.
[00:39:34.908 --> 00:39:48.756]  So we take you now to our final report of the evening, filed by Rob Due on the subject of Libya and the unfolding humanitarian disaster.
[00:39:49.617 --> 00:39:51.998]  NATO hands terrorists who killed U.S.
[00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:53.698]  troops control of Libya.
[00:39:56.738 --> 00:40:00.659]  Al Qaeda gets a new home after the so-called rebels seize Tripoli.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.260]  While U.S.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:13.522]  troops are dying in Afghanistan and Iraq in the supposed war on terror, these same terrorists are now being handed control of an entire country and its lucrative resources.
[00:40:15.054 --> 00:40:20.857]  As a massive NATO bombardment of Tripoli aids the al-Qaeda-backed rebels in their overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi.
[00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:25.119]  Qaddafi himself has gone into hiding outside the city.
[00:40:25.779 --> 00:40:37.705]  Shortly after the start of the conflict in March, Hakeem al-Hassadi, the leader of the anti-Qaddafi rebel army, admitted that rebel ranks include al-Qaeda terrorists who have killed U.S.
[00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:39.526]  troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:40:40.266 --> 00:40:45.909]  Al-Hassadi describes the fighters as, quote, patriots and good Muslims, not terrorists.
[00:40:46.990 --> 00:41:02.199]  As the Wall Street Journal reported in a piece entitled, Ex-Mujahideen Lead Libyan Rebels, al-Qaeda terrorists who worked directly for bin Laden were tasked with recruiting, training, and acting as frontline field commanders for the rebel army.
[00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:02.879]  In 2002,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:16.226]  French intelligence experts revealed how Western intelligence agencies bankrolled the Libyan al-Qaeda cell controlled directly by Osama bin Laden to hatch a plot to kill Colonel Qaddafi that was foiled in March of 1996.
[00:41:17.847 --> 00:41:19.788]  Indeed, it was Qaddafi's Libya
[00:41:20.408 --> 00:41:24.090]  Who put out the first Interpol warrant for Bin Laden's arrest in 1998.
[00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:33.616]  Western intelligence agencies blocked the warrant from being pursued, allowing Bin Laden and Al Qaeda to go on and kill more than 200 people in the truck bombings of the U.S.
[00:41:33.656 --> 00:41:35.617]  embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
[00:41:36.717 --> 00:41:41.420]  Some of the very rebels now being funded, trained, and given embassies in Britain and U.S.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:47.924]  were part of the Al Qaeda cell that tried to kill Gaddafi on behalf of the United States and Britain 15 years ago.
[00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:54.642]  Libya's future hinges on the globalist ability to lie long enough to get an occupation force in place.
[00:41:55.503 --> 00:42:04.407]  Richard Haass, president of the Fortune 500 line, Council on Foreign Relations, has stated clearly that, quote, Libya now needs boots on the ground.
[00:42:05.808 --> 00:42:07.209]  NATO boots, to be specific.
[00:42:08.095 --> 00:42:15.560]  The UK has already admitted to having prepared at least 200 more troops to land in Libya at any given moment.
[00:42:16.181 --> 00:42:20.944]  And arrangements are already underway to tap NATO members for additional troop commitments.
[00:42:22.885 --> 00:42:25.067]  This is Rob Due for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:42:27.847 --> 00:42:34.412]  Well, great job this evening to our entire crew, and that basically concludes this special report.
[00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:39.615]  To be clear, we're going to be doing special reports that are more extensive, like the one you've just watched tonight.
[00:42:40.176 --> 00:42:46.560]  We're also going to have the focused, hard-hitting, condensed news program that will air Monday through Friday, 7 p.m.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.721]  Central, that's 8 p.m.
[00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:49.862]  Eastern, every night for 30 minutes.
[00:42:50.262 --> 00:42:53.685]  But many evenings there will be expanded special reports.
[00:42:54.266 --> 00:42:54.907]  We're good.
[00:43:03.393 --> 00:43:08.297]  The very cutting edge of alternative media for 16 years and we're reaching so many millions of people.
[00:43:08.697 --> 00:43:12.700]  That's why we've built this new studio and are expanding.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:22.408]  And what you're seeing here are just the very start and the beginnings of much wider things that we're going to be doing.
[00:43:22.448 --> 00:43:26.852]  And I want to thank all of you that are here at the genesis of this new operation.
[00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:33.233]  Now I told you that a lot of times at the end of the news show, or at the end of a special report, we'll have an expanded commentary.
[00:43:33.774 --> 00:43:45.144]  And so I want to leave you with more of Alex Jones with a report I filed yesterday, and we're premiering here, where I break down one of the most insane outrages I've ever seen.
[00:43:45.725 --> 00:43:48.767]  Every time I think that I have seen it all.
[00:43:49.705 --> 00:43:57.475]  Every time that I think that the global social engineers can't be more arrogant in their activities, I am.
[00:43:59.053 --> 00:43:59.433]  Shocked.
[00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:02.355]  Every time I think I can't be shocked, I am shocked.
[00:44:03.016 --> 00:44:10.461]  They have banned the police, the firefighters, the military, the heroes of 9-11 from being part of the 10th anniversary.
[00:44:11.162 --> 00:44:18.587]  And I answer the questions in this special report of why the establishment is doing something this bizarre.
[00:44:20.228 --> 00:44:21.631]  It's because they're scared of these people.
[00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:25.938]  They know these folks are awake to what really happened on 9-11 and that is the answer.
[00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:29.364]  So I take you now from Alex Jones to Alex Jones.
[00:44:29.384 --> 00:44:32.550]  We'll see you back live tomorrow on the radio 11 a.m.
[00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:32.891]  Central.
[00:44:41.698 --> 00:44:51.512]  Every time I think the globalists cannot top their outrageous crimes and bizarre behavior, I am completely blown away.
[00:44:53.052 --> 00:45:15.784]  CNN, Fox News, you name it, are reporting that the firefighters, the police officers, the National Guard, the medics, the doctors that rush towards the destruction as true heroes on 9-11 are barred from the September 11th, 10th anniversary events in New York.
[00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:17.345]  Here's the headline out of CNN.
[00:45:17.745 --> 00:45:21.668]  First responders to cry exclusion from 9-11 ceremony.
[00:45:21.768 --> 00:45:29.073]  Regardless of what the official story is, whether it's true or not, you can't debate that these men and women were heroes.
[00:45:29.734 --> 00:45:32.856]  They rushed in when everybody else ran out.
[00:45:33.336 --> 00:45:40.442]  Thousands of first responders died and they're now barred from being part of the memorial services.
[00:45:41.062 --> 00:45:42.203]  You have to ask yourself why.
[00:45:43.342 --> 00:45:49.786]  This is happening because they are questioning the official story, the official fairy tale.
[00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:57.251]  And they're also questioning the fact that they've been blocked from getting medical care for nine plus years.
[00:45:58.032 --> 00:46:01.354]  I'm the first person to officially question the official story of 9-11.
[00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:07.078]  And in the first few years, I went to ground zero on the anniversaries
[00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.999]  And a lot of the people there were angry at me.
[00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:12.780]  A lot of the first responders that were there were angry.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.941]  But in the last five years, something else happened entirely.
[00:46:18.521 --> 00:46:29.765]  The majority of the first responders came over, firefighters, police, captains, commanders, you name it, and shook my hand.
[00:46:30.939 --> 00:46:33.040]  And said, we remember the bombs going off.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.041]  We remember the reports of controlled demolition.
[00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:48.306]  After all, they were told that the air was safe to breathe, even though it was admitted that Christina Todd Whitman first reported deadly asbestos and other chemicals piled up feet deep.
[00:46:48.926 --> 00:46:55.010]  She was ordered by the White House to lie and tell first responders no respiration masks needed.
[00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.790]  Don't worry.
[00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.011]  Go in now.
[00:46:57.311 --> 00:46:58.352]  There's no health problem.
[00:46:58.592 --> 00:46:59.572]  And it gets even worse.
[00:46:59.632 --> 00:47:13.941]  Not only are these heroes barred from the 10th anniversary, where these whore politicians are going to grandstand and talk about how they're heroes and sell a police state in America and all these wars on the backs of the dead and dying.
[00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:19.156]  Now it's come out that they run them through a terror database.
[00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:26.262]  For nine years, we pushed to get health care for those who were poisoned by asbestos and other chemicals.
[00:47:26.623 --> 00:47:30.886]  And finally, Congress passed a paltry sum to give them some medical care.
[00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:36.771]  They say you've got to be run through a Homeland Security database every time you get that health care.
[00:47:37.032 --> 00:47:41.696]  So the firefighters, the police officers, the military survivors, the veterans,
[00:47:42.316 --> 00:47:46.479]  Are run through a terror database every time they get a prescription filled.
[00:47:46.939 --> 00:47:48.440]  Every time they get medical care.
[00:47:48.921 --> 00:47:50.241]  This is outrageous.
[00:47:50.301 --> 00:47:56.205]  And now we've learned unions all over the country make their members get homeland security approval to have a job.
[00:47:56.686 --> 00:48:05.572]  This is preparing everyone for a system where if you're not a good little New World Order minion, a good little globalist Nazi, you're not going to be able to have a job.
[00:48:06.232 --> 00:48:11.917]  And I remember watching Governor Ridge, the former head of Homeland Security, on C-SPAN admit this eight years ago.
[00:48:12.617 --> 00:48:15.880]  This is such an incredible betrayal.
[00:48:16.781 --> 00:48:33.934]  And it shows you why the federal documents we've received from law enforcement are so pertinent, where they list the number one terror threat as returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, people that want to end the Fed, people that want to end these wars, people that want to get us out of the UN.
[00:48:34.975 --> 00:48:39.560]  The truth is, we have criminal banks in control of America that are looting this country.
[00:48:39.981 --> 00:48:48.911]  And they want to use the image of those firefighters and police, those heroes, to push their police state takeover and TSA going on the streets of America.
[00:48:49.332 --> 00:48:50.713]  And they don't want those angry...
[00:48:51.514 --> 00:49:07.286]  Survivors who have pointed out the deadly dust and pointed out the fact that there were bombs in the buildings, they don't want them down there with Obama and Bush and the rest of them, while these blood-sucking globalists use their heroics and their memory to sell their tyranny.
[00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:15.873]  But in the final equation, it is going to be truth, not delusions and not propaganda, that is going to save our republic and our society.
[00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:20.801]  and reverse the criminal tide that is dominating our species.
[00:49:21.783 --> 00:49:28.176]  It is going to be the cold hard facts that is going to defeat the globalists and their spin doctors and propaganda.
[00:49:29.022 --> 00:49:42.707]  That's why, in closing, I want to encourage all of you to spread the word about our new weeknight TV show that kicks off September 1st, next Thursday, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:55.752]  And many weeknights, we're going to have expanded special reports that air right after the new news show.
[00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:57.413]  We're winning.
[00:49:58.783 --> 00:49:59.689]  We're waking people up.
[00:50:00.785 --> 00:50:06.310]  Free humanity cannot be stopped because the light of liberty burns in all of your hearts and souls.
[00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.053]  So please spread the word about InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:50:10.854 --> 00:50:16.478]  And please spread the word about the fact that no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:19.361]  Remember, this is an InfoWar.
[00:50:19.781 --> 00:50:21.362]  There's a war on for your mind.
[00:50:21.803 --> 00:50:29.209]  Break those mental shackles today and fulfill your destiny to be a free, sentient human being.
[00:50:29.409 --> 00:50:33.451]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:35.072]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:50:35.352 --> 00:50:43.797]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place against the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:50:44.237 --> 00:50:47.419]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:50:47.679 --> 00:50:48.539]  But take heart.
[00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:52.241]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:57.504]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:50:57.924 --> 00:51:01.507]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.168]  The globalists are scared.
[00:51:03.488 --> 00:51:04.489]  They've overreached.
[00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:07.952]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
