[00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:21.593]  I'm Darren McBreen with InfoWars Nightly News and I'm here today at the Texas State Capitol and we're about to find out if the people of Austin are aware that they are about to be hit by a wave of utility bill hikes as new EPA regulations drive up the cost of energy.
[00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:28.175]  What do you think about paying higher utility bills because of the EPA's new regulations against power plants?
[00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:31.996]  You know, there may be some new regulations coming up against power plants at this point.
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:43.929]  But unfortunately right now, I think that our citizens statewide and nationwide basically overburdened, especially with today's economic developments and situations that are going on.
[00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.831]  I think rate hikes should be at a minimal to at least try to alleviate some of the burden on our taxpayers and our citizens nationwide and statewide.
[00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:56.427]  I know a lot of people that are going to be not only shocked, but a little bit irritated about that as well.
[00:00:56.447 --> 00:01:01.633]  Because it's such a hot summer, everybody's bills are already up through the roof.
[00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:05.137]  You're already paying through the roof because the ACs are running non-stop.
[00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:12.306]  And then all of a sudden it's like, on top of that and with a downturn economy, yeah, it doesn't seem to jive that well.
[00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.906]  Of course I don't want to pay higher utility bills.
[00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:18.267]  They're already extremely high right now as it is.
[00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:22.488]  Well, I don't want to pay more because of the carbon dioxide thing.
[00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:23.408]  That doesn't seem right.
[00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:24.988]  Especially if it's not even proven.
[00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:34.310]  Generally, I prefer regulations that deter pollution and paying a little bit more for that than an unregulated environment.
[00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.031]  It all has to be regulated some way, right?
[00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.091]  What are you going to mess our environment up?
[00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:46.150]  I understand the tax on carbon footprints, but I mean, who's, you know, getting a new Lexus, you know what I mean?
[00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.132]  Do you think that carbon dioxide is dangerous?
[00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.875]  I think carbon dioxide can be very dangerous.
[00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:56.277]  Okay, what do plants breathe?
[00:01:57.638 --> 00:01:58.638]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:09.066]  Yeah, I think carbon dioxide is definitely dangerous, otherwise there wouldn't be any, like, rules and laws to prevent it being... What do plants breathe?
[00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:11.383]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.305]  Carbon dioxide is turned into oxygen by plants.
[00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:19.487]  So, I mean, it has to be in the world.
[00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:21.708]  Obviously, it's not all dangerous.
[00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:26.770]  Carbon dioxide isn't a dangerous gas, but when there's too much of it, it's a problem.
[00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:36.915]  Carbon dioxide, even though it's a natural gas consumed by plants, it can be dangerous because, well, everyone says it has to do with global warming.
[00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.796]  Behind me is the Holly Street Power Plant.
[00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:44.219]  It was partially closed in 2004 and officially shut down in 2007.
[00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.921]  Now it's simply a reminder of Austin's energy independence.
[00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:57.046]  What do you think about the fact that General Electric, one of Obama's biggest donors, that they get a waiver and they will not be subject to the regulations?
[00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.906]  That sounds like politics and lobbyists' web work.
[00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:00.247]  I mean, it's government, right?
[00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:01.648]  No surprise.
[00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:02.068]  Sounds plausible.
[00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.149]  Yeah, it sounds plausible.
[00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.089]  There's no surprise about that.
[00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:06.736]  General Electric doesn't need any favors from anybody.
[00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.698]  They're a multi-billion dollar corporation.
[00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:16.585]  Are you aware that some of these new regulations are also shutting down power plants and this is causing some of the rolling blackouts throughout Texas?
[00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:18.386]  No, I wasn't familiar with that actually.
[00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.908]  I didn't realize that was going on.
[00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:22.490]  Lobbyists make a lot of money striking these deals.
[00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.271]  There's a lot of things that we don't know.
[00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:29.456]  And how government, you know, the tax breaks, the incentives, loopholes, you name it.
[00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.438]  So I think it's just one more to add to the list.
[00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:40.373]  Well, as you can see, Alex, the people here in Austin, they're aware that their utility rates are going up, but they're not sure of the real cause.
[00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:43.895]  This is Darren McBrain with InfoWars Nightly News.
