[00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.386]  And if you think that's bad, don't worry.
[00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:15.033]  Al-Qaeda chief Amman al-Zawahiri is taking credit for the Arab Spring all over the Middle East.
[00:00:15.613 --> 00:00:19.016]  The rebellions, the overthrows of old Western dictators.
[00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:22.278]  And you know, that's got to warm your heart a little bit.
[00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.664]  The known CIA operative along with Amir al-Awlaki, who died secretly at the Pentagon.
[00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:30.785]  Just listen to that music.
[00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:42.108]  They've been given Libya now and missiles and billions of dollars, and they're taking credit for the Arab Spring that the West has been supporting.
[00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.209]  Come on!
[00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:45.150]  Come on!
[00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:50.774]  China's gonna let you dress up like Mary Poppins?
[00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:51.895]  No.
[00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:55.357]  China's gonna shoot you in the back of the head and blow your brains all over the place.
[00:00:56.478 --> 00:00:57.439]  Little stupid commie.
[00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.679]  All right, I'm done.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.280]  I'm done.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.060]  I'm done with them for now.
[00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.993]  These people, they are attacking our system and they have no idea what the rest of the world is like.
[00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:07.094]  God forgive them, they don't know what they're doing.
[00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:09.976]  Okay, okay, this is going too long here.
[00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:19.241]  I mean, it's kind of like if you have to bathe in a port-a-potty, and you open up one that's totally full, and one's only half full, it's like, well, I'll bathe in the Herman Cain.
[00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:25.305]  I mean, when it comes to bathing, and you don't want to bathe in 500 turds, or 200.
[00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.787]  I mean, I'm sorry to get gross here, but that's what it comes down to.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.321]  That's right.
[00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.187]  That's very funny, dude.
[00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.873]  He's got 999 droppings.
[00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.058]  Well, I know he's got one there in his hand.
[00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:41.762]  He's like, come on over here, vampire.
[00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.166]  Come on over here and suck my blood.
[00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:45.387]  She's like, I will, don't worry.
[00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:48.349]  When they turn the lights out, I'm going to light your ass up.
[00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.791]  Man, I'm telling you.
[00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.713]  I mean, people are like, it's Ann Coulter.
[00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:58.216]  And I turned, there's all these SWAT teams and troops right outside the checkpoint.
[00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.177]  And I was like, is that?
[00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:00.958]  She could hardly walk.
[00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:01.718]  It was like a zombie.
[00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:02.098]  It was like...
[00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:09.509]  I swear, through the strength of this picture, you guys think I'm joking!
[00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.150]  This actually happened, Ann Coulter literally is like, giant knees and elbows.
[00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.651]  She's like, ah, brains, ah!
[00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:17.871]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:19.691]  Okay.
[00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.792]  Alright, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:28.793]  He pits his strength, his courage, and his fabulous sun sword against the forces of evil.
[00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:33.715]  Look at the evil.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:35.075]  I mean,
[00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:39.883]  Everywhere this is decried.
[00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:42.444]  Republicans, Democrats, mainline media, they hate it.
[00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:44.785]  Here's some pizza, here's some money.
[00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:46.085]  He's the nice guy.
[00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:46.465]  He's the nice guy.
[00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:52.987]  And he's like, let me come here, let me tell you, it's like, get out of here right now, you know.
[00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:54.127]  Exactly.
[00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:56.428]  But here's some pizza, here's a little money.
[00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:57.508]  He can do that to me if he wants.
[00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:00.009]  Get out of here, get out of here.
[00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.209]  You're a good guy.
[00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.810]  Let me tell you, you know, we don't want you to be in the river.
[00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.591]  I got one that can see.
[00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:07.671]  We should have that clip where
[00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:10.072]  I got one that can see.
[00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:11.734]  Get in there and deal with him right now.
[00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:14.736]  He was looking at you with that predatory scanning.
[00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:16.358]  Control.
[00:03:17.078 --> 00:03:19.120]  Manipulate scientific data.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.700]  Takeover.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.101]  Blast.
[00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.581]  Control.
[00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:21.742]  World government.
[00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:22.983]  Shut down infrastructure.
[00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.704]  Ship everything to China.
[00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:28.187]  He's just... Look at this person.
[00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:29.728]  And you're like, I can see.
[00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:30.769]  And he's like, whoa!
[00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:31.810]  Whoa!
[00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.311]  Whoa!
[00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.272]  Whoa!
[00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:34.893]  No!
[00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:35.973]  A red alert!
[00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:36.834]  Red alert!
[00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.954]  Humanity will crush you!
[00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:47.619]  I love it!
[00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:48.960]  They're weak!
[00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.124]  And the minute we reveal them, their destruction begins!
[00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:54.925]  Parasites will be crushed!
[00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:56.867]  I can taste your weakness!
[00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:58.869]  Crushing, crushing, crushing!
