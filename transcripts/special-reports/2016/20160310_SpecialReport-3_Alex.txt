[00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:23.445]  Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives.
[00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:29.878]  Roughly one year from now, Obama's stranglehold over the executive office of the U.S.
[00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:31.359]  government will end.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.902]  Impeaching Obama now seems to many to be futile.
[00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.744]  Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama?
[00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.188]  The best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left, okay?
[00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:46.951]  Because, you know, by the time you do the hearings and everything, I don't... So don't make him a martyr?
[00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:49.173]  In a way, you'll make him a martyr, but I don't even say that.
[00:00:49.493 --> 00:00:53.937]  But the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it, they'll try... Instead of
[00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:57.441]  Get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan.
[00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:11.520]  But wouldn't impeaching a president that has toyed with the Constitution with nothing to lose in the final days of his term, like a pyromaniac playing with gasoline in matches, send a stern message to future presidents?
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:27.167]  As a result of Watergate, the warning shot America fired after the comparatively minimal damage Richard Nixon did to the reputation of the White House seems to have been long forgotten, similar to the way the American people have all but given up on the U.S.
[00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:27.667]  Congress.
[00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:37.510]  Now Congressional Republicans are promising to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood for the sake of the overwhelming demands of their constituents.
[00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:48.373]  Of course, the bill will be sent to Obama's desk where it will be vetoed, but the bill can't be amended by Democrats due to special rules attached to it by the Senate.
[00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:56.298]  And if there is any sanity left in American politics, a vote for veto override will be set for January 22nd.
[00:01:56.558 --> 00:02:10.488]  Led by Obama's new lapdog, Paul Ryan, it appears to be just another elaborate stunt to rejuvenate public support for a Congress that has earned itself an 82% disapproval rating, according to Gallup polls.
[00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:22.532]  While 318 million plus Americans sit and wait for Congress to get their snouts out of the corporate trough, wouldn't impeaching Obama send a clear message to the sycophantic takeover of Congress?
[00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.373]  That we are coming for you next?
[00:02:25.873 --> 00:02:31.535]  Obama's staged gun grabbing is finally fueling long overdue impeachment talks.
[00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:38.556]  Now the Republican National Committee is to consider a resolution drafted for the impeachment of President Barack Obama.
[00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:50.519]  The resolution, which seems to have been drafted by the North American Law Center, is to be weighed up at a January 13th meeting of the RNC, reports Brandon Hall of West Michigan Politics Blog.
[00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:55.360]  The document is titled, Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:11.085]  Article 2 of the resolution lists 19 examples of Obama's malfeasance, misconduct, and abuse of the Oval Office, including the IRS targeting of conservative organizations and bypassing Congress with the use of executive action on key issues.
[00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:24.134]  Article 3 of the resolution states that Obama has been aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States, citing the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban, among others.
[00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:34.160]  RNC committeeman Dave Agema told the Daily Wire in an interview that he will introduce the resolution, which consists of 48 criminal charges in total.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.241]  Agema said,
[00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:41.565]  I'm good.
[00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:10.466]  Legally, all we have left is to send in the Sergeant at Arms in the Senate to slap the handcuffs onto President Obama.
[00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:15.993]  It's interesting how the Senate has now made that information unavailable to the general populace.
[00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:18.136]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:33.435]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.797]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:37.577]  Here we go, folks!
[00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:38.497]  I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:44.800]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.762]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:54.704]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:57.865]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:05.968]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.289]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.390]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:18.520]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
