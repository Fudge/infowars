[00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:11.184]  Revenant.
[00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.786]  One who has come back from the dead.
[00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:17.647]  Like Lazarus of the Bible.
[00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:20.808]  I went and saw this movie last night.
[00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.108]  I thought it was excellent.
[00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:23.769]  I'm already a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:30.471]  I don't really agree with this politics, but this director did an amazing job.
[00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.412]  It is truly avant-garde.
[00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:33.593]  It was also very disturbing.
[00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.214]  More than two and a half hours long.
[00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.015]  I was glad when it was over.
[00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:40.078]  It was definitely an experience.
[00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:44.380]  And I'm also frustrated by the way history's been projected here in the United States.
[00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.282]  This is a little bit politically correct, but not too much.
[00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:55.168]  Almost all cowboy and Indian westerns, right through from John Wayne and Stagecoach
[00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:08.938]  up to Dances with Wolves with Kevin Costner, show what happened out west in the 1860s to the 1890s, as if Comanches were the only tribe that existed.
[00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:20.089]  From the beginning of settling going on with the Mayflower, there were different diverse tribes, some loving, some warlike, some inventive, some political, or a mix of the two.
[00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.218]  There were huge wars where the natives would use the French and the British and others off against each other as proxies or the other way around.
[00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.066]  The biggest Indian wars, as they were called with the Native Americans, happened between the 1820s and the 1850s.
[00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:39.612]  That's when the big deciding wars happened in the Midwest on the Mississippi.
[00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:47.656]  And let me tell you, this film is set right around that time, and it gives you a real flavor for what was going on.
[00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.917]  It wasn't whites against the natives, or natives against the whites.
[00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.278]  It was French and natives working together, or against each other.
[00:01:56.258 --> 00:02:05.380]  It absolutely captured what was going on, and the fact that it was barbarous, Conan the Barbarian for real type insanity.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.400]  And I would love to see cinema.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.161]  We've got Last of the Mohicans, you know, set in the
[00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.063]  1730s and 40s or so, and that's very accurate of what happened.
[00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:17.864]  It's, you know, based on fiction, but has some real events in it.
[00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:25.247]  But there's no other movies that pick up anything from the, you know, 1600s really, up until the 1860s and past that.
[00:02:25.507 --> 00:02:30.710]  And that's because newspapers finally began serializing the Indian Wars out West.
[00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.133]  And making it, you know, popular to follow the extermination of the quote, engines, using the racist term.
[00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:56.650]  It wasn't a fun topic and it wasn't something to read books about for entertainment back when whole cities were being burned and armies of Native Americans mixed in with whites and others would pour down by the hundreds of thousands in some cases and kill tens of thousands of people a day in some cases.
[00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.611]  I mean, whole states wiped out.
[00:02:58.771 --> 00:02:59.631]  It was incredible.
[00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:07.853]  And you look at somebody like Andrew Jackson, America's president, who grew up fighting the British, lost his mother and brother to the British, lost a lot of family to the natives.
[00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:09.654]  An Indian fighter.
[00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:16.256]  A guy that was overwhelmed time and time again with people like Davy Crockett and Sam Houston that worked under him.
[00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:21.599]  And you understand why it was exterminate them, drive them out, round them up, kick them out.
[00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.500]  Because it was a death battle.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.061]  And I'm not defending what they did or what the natives did.
[00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:37.066]  It's just, it wasn't like it's 2016 and we're all in a beautiful glistening city with, you know, Walmarts and Safeways and Targets and the white guys are going up killing little sweet Indians with pink flowers.
[00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:48.447]  Most of the tribes were mega-savage, would kill the men and the women and take your children if you were lucky, just enslaving other native tribes.
[00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:49.447]  I mean, it was hardcore.
[00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:50.748]  Look at the Aztecs south of us.
[00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:54.929]  They came as far north as, you know, up into South Texas grabbing people for sacrifice.
[00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.453]  So, humans are humans, different cultures, do different things in different periods, but we're pretty much all the same at the end of the day.
[00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:06.695]  And this movie actually goes a long way towards showing some of that.
[00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:09.156]  It shows both sides.
[00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:13.058]  It kind of leans towards the natives 2 or 3 percent, but it's not like 90% leaning.
[00:04:13.638 --> 00:04:18.600]  So I want to say good job to the director, good job to Leonardo DiCaprio, good job to the other actors.
[00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:20.481]  The bad guy does a great job in the movie.
[00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:22.782]  So I'm impressed with this film.
[00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:25.584]  I have no stock in it, obviously.
[00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:28.425]  Some will say, why are you promoting something when you're a political show?
[00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:30.106]  Well, all art is political.
[00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:35.342]  And we more and more are going to be covering art some, because that's where the real propaganda is going on.
[00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:45.054]  We want to reward good art, more accurate art from our perspective, by promoting it and by supporting it, and then we're going to attack stuff that's garbage and filth.
[00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.477]  Okay, so that's what it comes down to.
[00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:49.479]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:03.217 --> 00:05:05.458]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:12.800]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, and they were sent back.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.040]  They knew what was going on.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.781]  They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.
[00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.223]  Who else would come back like that at the Bushes and the Clintons calling them criminals?
[00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:23.023]  And the Saudis.
[00:05:23.043 --> 00:05:24.383]  You guys go back to your live feeds.
[00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.784]  You say, we don't have rights in America.
[00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:29.707]  Only the people who are outside of this country have a right.
[00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:32.870]  The only right that anybody has is to come live in America.
[00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.633]  Presumably to live off of us, if that's what they choose.
[00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:39.157]  They can come live off of us, they can come create war in our country.
[00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:40.038]  That's their right.
[00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.201]  But people in America don't have rights.
[00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:47.286]  The first and most important priority of the President of the United States is to protect the safety and security of America.
[00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:47.767]  No it isn't!
[00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:49.248]  You're disqualified.
[00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:56.994]  You have an oath to the Constitution, and the oath to the Constitution says, and the Declaration of Independence says, you are created to protect our freedoms.
[00:05:57.394 --> 00:05:57.655]  Right.
[00:05:57.975 --> 00:05:59.316]  Not to keep us safe.
[00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:00.677]  They didn't want safety.
[00:06:00.697 --> 00:06:05.361]  They wouldn't have rebelled against the strongest government in the world if their first priority was safety.
[00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:06.561]  Their first priority was liberty.
[00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:08.403]  They created a government to protect that.
[00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:09.504]  I'm sick of these people.
[00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:13.006]  If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against who's coming in.
[00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:19.131]  And Marco has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.
[00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.934]  Do you really think that Republicans have fueled the rise of ISIS?
[00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:31.441]  I think that by arming the allies of ISIS, the Islamic rebels against Assad, that we created a safe space.
[00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:33.862]  We made that space bigger for ISIS to grow.
[00:06:34.222 --> 00:06:35.363]  We know what's going on.
[00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:37.084]  We know these guys are running ISIS.
[00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:41.846]  And when they talk about shutting down freedom of speech, he just repeated the exact same stuff he said in his speech.
[00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:46.788]  Even talking about how you don't refer to these people as masterminds, he knows precisely what he's saying.
[00:06:47.048 --> 00:06:51.053]  These are a bunch of Morlocks, and the American people are a bunch of Eloy.
[00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:54.056]  When they talk about serving America, you're on the menu.
[00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:08.992]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, but only for one more week.
[00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:12.435]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:23.504]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch The Nightly News, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:26.867]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:35.954]  And you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:40.737]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:42.558]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:48.182]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:56.328]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[00:07:56.428 --> 00:08:12.095]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:13.175]  The Reporters.
[00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:16.536]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:24.918]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family, share your passcode with them, your username.
[00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:29.319]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:30.680]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
