[00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:12.018]  The ghetto.
[00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:16.382]  Not the place you would imagine methods of global dominance to spring from.
[00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:28.693]  But it was in the ghettos across the United States that Saul Alinsky would fine-tune tactics of civil disobedience that would one day be employed by New World Order puppet Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:33.717]  Another problem.
[00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:37.598]  Alinsky's Rules for Radicals is the left's playbook.
[00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:46.620]  Chock full of creeping tactics used by scheming politicians and Soros-fueled millennial generation groups like Black Lives Matter.
[00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.221]  All lives matter.
[00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.442]  All lives matter.
[00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:53.102]  And I'm a black guy.
[00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.045]  Hell-bent on tearing the fabric of American society apart.
[00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:09.056]  Anti-cop rhetoric that is sweeping the United States of America, fueled by this group, some of the vulgar, vile, vicious rhetoric that's coming out, talking about killing cops.
[00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:37.154]  Alinsky's albeit deceptively noble attempt to create a system to reward the have-nots with the power and surplus of the haves would prove to be just as useful for the New World Order sycophants to achieve an uprooting of American values and an overpass of the United States Constitutional Foundation to be replaced by totalitarianism disguised as compassionate socialism.
[00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.575]  These tactics simply needed the perfect
[00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:47.439]  All of us want to give our president every tool necessary to do this.
[00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.360]  And all of us were willing to do that in this bill.
[00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:53.916]  And anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people.
[00:01:54.357 --> 00:02:04.705]  Saul Alinsky died decades before a young pre-Senate Barack Obama would spend three years following in Alinsky's footsteps as a community organizer.
[00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:18.056]  In 2009, the National Review stated, Obama's mentors from his Chicago days studied at a school Alinsky founded, and they taught their students the philosophy and methods of one of the first community organizers.
[00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:26.923]  Saul Alinsky wrote in Rules for Radicals, As an organizer, I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be.
[00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:34.250]  That we accept the world as it is doesn't in any sense weaken our desire to change it into what we believe it should be.
[00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.135]  It is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we think it should be.
[00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:43.238]  That means working in the system.
[00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:51.547]  So what are some of the tactics being utilized in that system at accelerating degrees in the shaping of modern American society?
[00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:58.155]  Rule number one, power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.
[00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:13.973]  Obama and the nut jobs in the nation's capital would have us all believe that they have overwhelming support from the have-nots while destroying the middle class, increasing the debt and welfare class to unsustainable levels, and projecting it all from their mainstream media bubble.
[00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:18.038]  Rule number two, never go outside the expertise of your people.
[00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:18.799]  Basically,
[00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.542]  Why bother engaging in a rational debate based on facts with your adversary?
[00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:29.566]  Simply bring up the despised policies or traditions and belittle them until they are crushed.
[00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:32.308]  Less than loving expressions by Christians?
[00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:35.496]  I get concerned.
[00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:36.437]  That's right.
[00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.601]  Let's criticize Christianity on Easter, you piece of crap.
[00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.722]  That's a topic for another day.
[00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:41.325]  Skipping to rule number eight.
[00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:42.987]  Keep the pressure on.
[00:03:43.388 --> 00:03:44.469]  Never let up.
[00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.293]  Obama must say this rule to himself every morning.
[00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:50.258]  As one shoe drops, another one is ready to fall.
[00:03:50.498 --> 00:04:04.761]  Not in the manner of a leader responding to a country's pleas in the midst of a crisis, but more in the vein of a tyrant quietly and charismatically creating them, while offering shallow direction as stale as his predecessor's rhetoric.
[00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:13.883]  And if just that sample of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals wasn't enough, Alinsky even dedicated the left's playbook to Lucifer himself.
[00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:18.204]  I suppose given a choice I think I would pick hell.
[00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.394]  The reason I picked Hell is because that's where all the Hamlets are.
[00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.543]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:42.905]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:44.606]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:50.910]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.874]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:57.054 --> 00:05:00.815]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:03.896]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:12.078]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.399]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:15.499]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:24.610]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
