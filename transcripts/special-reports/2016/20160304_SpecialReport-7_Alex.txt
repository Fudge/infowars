[00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:26.061]  Filed under what's old is new again are the alarming steps Michael Springman, a high-level State Department official, took to inform the federal government that unqualified foreign applicants were being issued visas prior to 9-11.
[00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:34.149]  In Saudi Arabia, I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants.
[00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.670]  Springman told the BBC prior to the 9-11 attack.
[00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.792]  These were essentially people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country.
[00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:45.793]  I complained bitterly at the time there.
[00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:54.296]  I returned to the US, I complained to the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and to the Inspector General's office.
[00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:56.117]  I was met with silence.
[00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:01.639]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.933]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:15.315]  Fast forward approximately 15 years later, and Obama sounds like a broken record being played in an empty hall.
[00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:23.977]  Meanwhile here at home, the Department of Homeland Security is updating its alert system to help the American people stay vigilant and safe.
[00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:31.069]  And as always, our extraordinary men and women in uniform continue to put their lives on the line.
[00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:41.977]  Meanwhile, the Mirror UK reports, hackers have claimed that a number of Islamic State supporters' social media accounts are being run from internet addresses linked to the Department of Work and Pensions.
[00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:50.823]  The hacking collective showed Mirror Online details of the IP addresses used by a trio of separate digital jihadis to access Twitter accounts.
[00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:55.785]  Which were then used to carry out online recruitment and propaganda campaigns.
[00:01:56.106 --> 00:02:07.151]  At first glance, the IP addresses seem to be based in Saudi Arabia, but upon further inspection using specialist tools, they appeared to link back to the Department of Work and Pensions.
[00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:16.436]  The British government has admitted selling large numbers of internet addresses to Saudi Arabia, but has refused to reveal how much it has earned from the transaction.
[00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:27.905]  Although the government announced plans to auction its surplus IP numbers, it can now be revealed that a chunk of them went to Saudi Telecom and the Saudi-based mobile telecommunications company.
[00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:32.789]  Of course, the inept, record-breaking, tax-sucking behemoth known as the U.S.
[00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.535]  federal government, with all of its trillions spent on surveilling the average American's phone calls, emails, and browser history,
[00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:50.202]  And storing it all in a huge database guarded by psychotic thugs can't be bothered with monitoring the social media of potential terrorists entering the United States.
[00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:57.587]  The Hill reports Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson decided against ending a secret US policy.
[00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:58.648]  We're good to go.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.484]  But officials say it's still not a widespread policy and review is underway.
[00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.969]  Could the massacre that occurred in San Bernardino have been prevented?
[00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.215]  Had the feds actually done what most Americans thought they'd been doing all along?
[00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.316]  Probably not.
[00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.619]  The TSA can barely do their job.
[00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.262]  Sporting a pathetic 95% failure rate.
[00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:38.325]  The status quo is tearing into two separate realities.
[00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:42.448]  The arrogant compulsive fabrication the criminals in Washington D.C.
[00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:48.233]  are still hawking and another reality that for most Americans is a big pill to swallow.
[00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:55.739]  The growing evidence that layers of a trillion-dollar shadow government's nefarious inner workings are exponentially coming to light.
[00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.282]  For many Americans, admitting that your president is a traitor
[00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:03.765]  Based upon all of the evidence, it's difficult to look squarely in the eye.
[00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:12.691]  You know, George W. Bush, after he staged 9-11 with his daddy, he said, you're either with us, or with those al-Qaeda terrorists they hired on record.
[00:04:13.572 --> 00:04:15.253]  Well, I got news for the New World Order.
[00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:19.676]  You're either with humanity, or you're against us, and we're coming!
[00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:36.886]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:40.248]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:41.929]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:48.212]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:48.332 --> 00:04:54.215]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless and security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:58.136]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:01.257]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:09.419]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.740]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.820]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.949]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
