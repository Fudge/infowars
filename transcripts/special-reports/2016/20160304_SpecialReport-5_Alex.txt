[00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:19.908]  Back in April of 2015, 55 civil society organizations, security experts, and academics signed a letter opposing CISA.
[00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:26.030]  Then in October of 2015, the Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act by a vote of 74 to 21.
[00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:35.640]  That act quietly slipped its way into the government funding omnibus bill that was recently signed into law by President Obama.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.649]  However, the CISA privacy provisions added to the omnibus stripped even more privacy protections than the October version.
[00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.536]  They took a bad bill and they made it worse, says Robin Green, Policy Counsel for the Open Technology Institute.
[00:00:50.736 --> 00:01:03.389]  Essentially, warrantless searches of anyone's private information will be shared between third-party companies and a whole new host of federal agency portals, local police fusion centers, and as a side effect,
[00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.252]  Fact is, not every bill with cyber security in the title is necessarily a good idea.
[00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:48.466]  I believe this bill will do little to make Americans safer, but will potentially reduce the personal privacy of millions of Americans in a very substantial way.
[00:01:49.006 --> 00:02:00.129]  The groups that I'm talking about are ones with members who have companies with millions and millions of customers.
[00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:05.693]  And they're saying they can't support this bill at this time.
[00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.074]  I think I know why.
[00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:18.599]  These companies, who didn't have a problem with previous kinds of versions of this legislation, are saying they don't support it.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.642]  These companies, Mr. President, are hearing from their customers.
[00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:31.394]  And they're worried that their customers are saying, this doesn't look like it's going to protect our privacy.
[00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:32.736]  Of course we want to be safe.
[00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:35.859]  We also want to have our liberty.
[00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:42.368]  Ben Franklin famously said anyone who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either.
[00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:52.043]  In 2013, declassified documents revealed that the NSA had been scooping up thousands of emails of citizens it wasn't allowed to target.
[00:02:52.343 --> 00:03:05.289]  Simply put, if the government has any concern whether real or imagined about John Q. Public, they can easily raid any and everything Mr. Public shares online, and there is nothing John Q. can do about it.
[00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.651]  Emails, financial information, political philosophy,
[00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:18.133]  All of this done in the name of the CIA's blockbuster fail, The Interview, after Americans were sold the propaganda that North Korea had hacked Hollywood.
[00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:33.956]  Americans are now surveilled from the skies, wiretapped through their cell phones, energy usage is gathered by smart meters for the inevitable carbon taxation coming, and all personal documents and information are devoured online without Americans' consent.
[00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:38.840]  This makes the East German secret police, the Stasi, look like the Cub Scouts.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.564]  Completely unconstitutional, completely un-American, and illegal.
[00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.507]  Dealing a final death blow to the Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.188]  Solutions for the time being?
[00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.892]  Use a VPN service and change your DNS server.
[00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.414]  It won't be long before you are officially informed
[00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.937]  That you are no longer an American citizen.
[00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:01.762]  Your new self-identity is as the property of the New World Order.
[00:04:01.922 --> 00:04:04.144]  God bless what's left of America.
[00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.187]  John Bound for Infowars.com
[00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:20.975]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:24.357]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:26.037]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted.
[00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:32.320]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.342]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:38.502 --> 00:04:42.267]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:45.370]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:53.520]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.842]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:56.983]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:57.303 --> 00:05:06.069]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
