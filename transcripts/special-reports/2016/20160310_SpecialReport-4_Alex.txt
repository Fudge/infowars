[00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:24.433]  According to the hypocrisy playing out in the well-connected avenues of Hollywood, there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey that are still working, they're still out there, and they're some of the richest, most powerful people in this business.
[00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:31.257]  In the grease palms inhabiting the shady back rooms of Washington, D.C., being a serial rapist isn't a crime.
[00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:35.500]  Not if your first name is Bill, and not if it ends with Cosby or Clinton.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.162]  Of course, for the average serial rapist, take one Daniel Hoytsclaw, for instance.
[00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:53.026]  Hoytsclaw faces 263 years behind bars, as he should, for 18 counts of raping women ranging in the ages of 17 to 57, while serving as an Oklahoma police officer.
[00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:59.550]  Is there any difference in the allegations attached to Cosby and Clinton beyond the statute of limitations?
[00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:11.057]  Hoytsclaw used the plight of black females overwhelming fear that reporting rape guarantees negative results, especially since it was a police officer that committed the rape in the first place.
[00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:18.621]  Bill Cosby, a married man, allegedly lured his victims in with his celebrity and then drugged and raped them while they were passed out.
[00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.382]  According to no less than 45 accusations,
[00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:36.116]  However, the two recent rape allegations that stuck were thrown out by the LA District Attorney, resulting in a circus splashed all over mainstream media with Cosby's sad mug replacing his once straight-laced face of fatherhood.
[00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:48.809]  Hillary Clinton, who continues to dodge allegations of the rape of Juanita Broderick and the sexual assaults of many others, carries on proudly stumping for his wife to be the all-powerful Saul Alinskyite-in-chief.
[00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:57.477]  Hillary Clinton, a woman whose vague, illegitimate claim to being presidential material is her nefarious fumbling of Benghazi Egypt and Libya.
[00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:08.685]  While she was Secretary of State, Hillary soldiers on for the sake of her New World Order handlers shooting down questions by rape victims while pretending to champion for women's rights.
[00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.888]  Could there be any greater hypocrisy than this?
[00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:41.273]  And whether you agree or disagree on what may be dubious charges for the two bills, can we not agree on the fact that a mushrooming plague of rape is being largely ignored as rape in the military expands and the media coverage of the rape of American children by illegal aliens at unprecedented levels continues to be neglected?
[00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:55.000]  Meanwhile, Obama and company import the invasion of rape culture currently unleashing its will in Europe into America, while attempting to steal your Second Amendment protections from the incoming onslaught.
[00:02:55.301 --> 00:03:05.686]  Regardless of the blatant disrespect towards rape victims shown by our supposed upright leaders, know this, rapists, you have started something we aim to finish.
[00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:10.289]  You see, there are more than enough Americans that aren't as timid
[00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.091]  As the left may have led you to believe.
[00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:14.592]  There is a good side to the mob.
[00:03:14.813 --> 00:03:16.634]  You got the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:18.816]  Like everything else in politics.
[00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.397]  You have that too.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:21.478]  All the time I have.
[00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:25.041]  You have the rise of Hitler, who was in government.
[00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:27.583]  Then everybody else follows, you know, in Europe.
[00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:30.565]  They got no other ways but to take that side.
[00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:31.546]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.307]  Because they don't want to get killed and this and that.
[00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:39.753]  But then you got the good side, America, that rises up and connects and allies with the mob.
[00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:41.886]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.464]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:00.806]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.527]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:08.811]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:14.775]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:18.736]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:21.797]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:29.999]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.300]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.400]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.529]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
