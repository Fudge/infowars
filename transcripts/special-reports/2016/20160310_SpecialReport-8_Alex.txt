[00:00:01.172 --> 00:00:04.393]  Jakari Jackson reporting here from the University of Texas.
[00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.313]  We're going to ask the students here what they think about ride sharing.
[00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:09.413]  Ride sharing means things like Lyft and Uber.
[00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.514]  The City Council wants to put restrictions on Lyft and Uber.
[00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:19.155]  And their rationale is safety concerns, both driver identification as well as vehicle registration.
[00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:25.456]  But on the flip side of that, I do know from going to City Council meetings, they are pushing pretty hard to get people to use their public transportation.
[00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:28.657]  So we're going to talk to the students here and see if a middle ground can be reached.
[00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:32.167]  We're asking people what they think about services like Lyft and Uber.
[00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:34.869]  I think they're really helpful.
[00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.792]  They keep kids from drunk driving, which is really good.
[00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:43.295]  There's been enough drunk driving deaths already.
[00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:46.197]  I don't think the city should get rid of them.
[00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.398]  I mean, I definitely think it should be safe.
[00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:50.760]  I don't want to be getting in a car with a kidnapper.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.763]  There should be protocol, but it should also be there.
[00:00:55.944 --> 00:00:58.085]  Not just taxis, because taxis are expensive.
[00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.835]  I think that the basic registration of your vehicle, you know, having a valid license is important.
[00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.439]  Not necessarily having an extensive background check.
[00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.223]  It's everybody's choice to take an Uber, and usually you go in groups.
[00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:16.324]  I don't see much risk in it.
[00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:19.307]  We're asking people if they use services like Lyft or Uber.
[00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:20.788]  Yeah, I do.
[00:01:20.808 --> 00:01:23.871]  Okay, did you know that the City Council wants to see you?
[00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:25.072]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:26.313]  Okay, so what are your thoughts on that?
[00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:28.136]  I hope they don't take it away.
[00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:29.877]  I use it almost every weekend.
[00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:46.825]  I think we've got a great example of the free market working to produce service that people want, and the City Council deciding that that wasn't good enough, and that the combination of the people needing more safety than they're willing to pay for, and probably listening to some lobbying from the taxi industry.
[00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:49.626]  Okay, have you heard about the City Council trying to put the restrictions?
[00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:50.847]  I signed the petition, man.
[00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.247]  F*** City Council.
[00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:52.747]  Can I say that?
[00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:53.368]  Yeah, say it.
[00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:53.748]  F*** y'all.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:12.234]  In the decade after iodine was added to staple foods, there was a 15 point increase in IQs in the areas that had previously been deficient.
