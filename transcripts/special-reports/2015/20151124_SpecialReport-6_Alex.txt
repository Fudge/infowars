[00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:12.799]  Obama has decimated the friggin' Constitution, so I don't give a damn because if he doesn't follow the Constitution, we don't have to.
[00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:21.406]  Who needs that old archaic Constitution and annoying Congress when you can tour the world on the taxpayer's dime and trample their rights in the process, right?
[00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:29.673]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, no one except your band of cohorts were impressed when you went after a meaningless game as you tackled FIFA in
[00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:53.492]  Instead of throwing the bankers laundering the drug cartels billions under the jail, kicking the proverbial soccer ball down the road, rather than present her case to the American people from any number of American establishments, Attorney General Lynch, basking in New World Order arrogance, bypassed the American people, bringing together a vile congregation to the Islamic High Council, the United Nations.
[00:00:53.752 --> 00:01:01.580]  Speakers included the diligent socialist mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, who expressed the ominous, "...Extremism doesn't discriminate.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.201]  It comes in many forms.
[00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.424]  It comes in many different backgrounds and ideologies.
[00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:11.229]  Our mission should be to address extremism in all of its forms."
[00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:16.594]  And Jordan's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zayed Raad Al Hussein,
[00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:23.099]  A human rights council that just made the xenophobic and brutal nation of Saudi Arabia a member.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:37.712]  Writing for Breitbart, Pamela Geller explained, "...the United Nations is a Sharia-compliant world body, and Obama, speaking there just days ago, insisted that violent extremism is not exclusive to Islam, which it is."
[00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:42.618]  Obama is redefining jihad terror to include everyone but the jihadists.
[00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:53.111]  So will the UN, driven largely by Sharia-enforcing Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the OIC, and the pro-Islamic post-American President Obama,
[00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:57.512]  Use a global police force to crush counter-jihad forces?
[00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:07.593]  This global police force was dreamed up by professors in the halls of Oxford and spearheaded by the New World Order think tank, the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.
[00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:21.976]  Now launched as of September 29, 2015 by our traitorous government, it is described on the Strong Cities Network website as a global network of local authorities united in building resilience to prevent violent extremism.
[00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:28.599]  An international steering committee of cities and local authorities, selected from different regions across the globe.
[00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:32.241]  Of course, Muslim Americans are complaining they will be targeted.
[00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:42.125]  American Thinker writes, The Strong Cities program has been criticized by the New York Civil Liberties Union and by American Muslim activists, fearful that it will target Muslims.
[00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:47.388]  Similar criticisms have been leveled against the Department of Justice's Countering Violent Extremism program,
[00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:52.573]  Notably by the Islamist-posing-as-civil-rights group, Council on American-Islamic Relations.
[00:02:52.853 --> 00:03:03.825]  New York groups like the NYCLU, Association of Muslim American Lawyers, and the Justice League of NYC expressed concern that New York would eventually become active with the Justice Department's
[00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:11.169]  Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE programs, which they say overwhelmingly target Muslim communities.
[00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.913]  But most Americans know what Shinola looks and smells like, and are well aware of who the real target is.
[00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:26.178]  Oathkeepers asks, what assurances are there that it will be gained in accordance with individual protections mandated in the Bill of Rights?
[00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.519]  I'm good.
[00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:49.239]  Something more than one progressive Supreme Court justice has expressed an interest in considering flexible.
[00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:57.468]  President Obama is desperately attempting to decrease the overwhelming amount of gun owners to create a level playing field in which the New World Order can thrive.
[00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:03.855]  But it was his own policies and arrogance that led to record numbers of Americans stockpiling guns and ammunition.
[00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:13.362]  Obama's latest berserk executive order authority would impose new background check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers.
[00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:26.933]  Under the proposed rule change, dealers who exceed a certain number of sales each year would be required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and perform background checks on potential buyers.
[00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:27.774]  At this point,
[00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:53.412]  I'm sure the average American citizen contends that this all sounds completely unreasonable, considering the irony of President Obama's increasingly transparent administration that has blatantly waged war on constitutionally protected whistleblowers, clandestinely grown ISIS, ISIL, or whatever the hell you want to call it, and quietly aided a flood into the United States of anti-American Islamic extremist terror cells.
[00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:54.432]  Good luck, America.
[00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:55.693]  We're all counting on you.
[00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.815]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:07.663]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:10.987]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:12.709]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:18.936]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:25.080]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security by sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.922]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:31.984]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:40.189]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.510]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.611]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:52.721]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
