[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.004]  Recently we brought to the story about the Texas town that replaced their law enforcement with private security, and then saw a 61% decrease in crime.
[00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:20.766]  And I understand that's not a one-size-fits-all policy.
[00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:25.408]  You may have other sheriff's departments, other police departments that get along very well with their communities.
[00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:31.292]  So when I heard there was a similar story in Michigan, I was very intrigued, but also somewhat concerned.
[00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.793]  Because in Michigan, they have a private funded police department, which I think is great.
[00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:41.255]  But they also have it set up, if you donate enough money, you can then apply as a reserve officer.
[00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.257]  Which brings up questions about how well these guys are actually trained.
[00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:47.598]  Police Academy!
[00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:52.620]  I want to welcome all of you to... Citizens on Patrol!
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.020]  Citizens on Patrol!
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.102]  The Police Academy has offered to train you citizens... You just don't think I'm fast enough anymore, do you?
[00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:00.998]  You better protect yourselves.
[00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:02.380]  Do we get to pack heat?
[00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.283]  Yes ma'am, you can pack a gun.
[00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:10.428]  And I'll give the police department the benefit of the doubt and say that these officers are exceptionally well trained.
[00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.812]  But you still have the issue of being able to pay to play.
[00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.616]  If you have enough cash, you could potentially become a reserve officer.
[00:01:18.353 --> 00:01:19.693]  Which has some people on edge.
[00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:25.596]  You know, what if somebody gets on the force that isn't exactly the moral equivalent of what we want our officers to be?
[00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:33.158]  Because even with a regular police department, these guys undergo psychological evaluations and you still have these rogue guys who end up on the streets.
[00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:38.440]  So ultimately, I do applaud the Chief's ambitions, but only time will tell how well this thing works out.
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.662]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com and hopefully they don't end up with guys like this.
[00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:46.363]  This is great, man, isn't it?
[00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.772]  Me and you, security guards, out here acting like real cops.
[00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:51.373]  Wait!
[00:01:51.393 --> 00:01:52.553]  That's my car!
[00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:57.636]  You may re-procure your vehicle.
[00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:00.578]  That's not security!
[00:02:00.738 --> 00:02:02.119]  Get out of the damn car!
[00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.500]  Didn't your mama teach you any manners?
[00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.322]  At least you could ask me nicely!
[00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:21.231]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
