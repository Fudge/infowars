[00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:15.671]  Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a statement, the Defense Department's current regulations regarding transgender service members are outdated and are causing uncertainty that distracts commanders from our core missions.
[00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:30.494]  At a time when our troops have learned from experience that the most important qualification for service members should be whether they're able and willing to do their job, our officers and enlisted personnel are faced with certain rules that tell them the opposite.
[00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:38.457]  Defense Secretary Ash Carter said a working group formed to study the policy will be led by his personal undersecretary Brad Carson.
[00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:51.321]  It will operate under the presumption so-called transgenders are capable of serving without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness unless and except where objective practical impediments are identified.
[00:00:51.781 --> 00:01:02.531]  The working group will also look at the possibility of the United States military paying for the medical costs of surgeries and other treatment associated with any gender transition or reassignment.
[00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:13.582]  The move toward integrating transgender people into the military has support in Congress and is backed by Representative Adam Smith, ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.
[00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.455]  Chris, I've seen the reports of Secretary Carter's comments.
[00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:24.504]  I can tell you that the President agrees with the sentiment that all Americans who are qualified to serve should be able to serve.
[00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.770]  And for that reason, we here at the White House welcome the comments from the Secretary of Defense.
[00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:35.243]  You know, your gender identity, sexual orientation, these things shouldn't matter if you want to serve in the military.
[00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:41.289]  If you can do the job, and if you can contribute to the mission, you should be allowed to do that.
[00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:42.410]  You will not laugh!
[00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.571]  You will not cry!
[00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.153]  You will learn by the numbers!
[00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:46.094]  I will teach you!
[00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:50.598]  Meanwhile, the Daily Mail cites a shocking Heritage Foundation study that the U.S.
[00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:56.843]  military has become so depleted under Obama it is now only marginally able to defend the nation.
[00:01:57.063 --> 00:02:06.771]  The scathing report claims that decreases in the number of soldiers and naval ships have led to armed forces falling short of President Obama's national security strategy.
[00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.976]  Obama's aim was to ensure that the country could still fight two major conflicts at once, but the index of U.S.
[00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.277]  military strength report
[00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:17.499]  said that with current funding this would be problematic.
[00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.945]  The Quadrennial Defense Review announced last year that the army would be cut from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000.
[00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:28.247]  Fewest since World War II.
[00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:33.511]  These cuts will affect nearly every army installation in 2016 and 2017.
[00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:40.516]  But there was no mention by the Obama administration to cut the military ascensions vital to the national interest program.
[00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:43.776]  A program created to enlist illegal aliens.
[00:02:44.037 --> 00:02:52.698]  What kind of Twilight Zone reality are we in when the President of the United States is openly laying off American citizens while growing an army of illegal aliens?
[00:02:53.198 --> 00:03:09.661]  And if that morale killer wasn't enough to insult every American citizen that has fought for our country, Obama is supporting reform to shrink military pensions by 20% and ending the military healthcare system, TRICARE, in favor of dumping the military onto Obamacare.
[00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:24.356]  As this total failure of Obama's Commander-in-Chief authority rolls out, the cost of the war in Afghanistan is draining the coffers of the Treasury at a rate of $4 million per hour, while the booming black market opium trade's profits skyrocket.
[00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:28.520]  I saw a report about 3-4 years ago where you're in Afghanistan with the Marines,
[00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:33.785]  Where they admit that they're guarding the opium and helping, basically, produce it.
[00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.967]  The argument is, well, this way Al-Qaeda won't get it.
[00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.450]  Absolutely, literally true.
[00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.073]  Our encampments were in the poppy field.
[00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:47.879]  The harvesting of the crop happened right in front of us.
[00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.203]  There I was with the brave Marines at that time in Helmand Province.
[00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:53.184]  They're getting shot at.
[00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:56.647]  And they are effectively guarding the poppy fields.
[00:03:56.728 --> 00:03:59.330]  I think it's really a disastrous pawful.
[00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.554]  Impeachment seems to be the only real solution at this point.
[00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:07.619]  A president as reckless as this deserves to be impeached at the tail end of his presidency.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.305]  It would speak volumes to the globalists drooling over what's left of our treasure and our sovereignty.
[00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:15.408]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:26.078]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.863]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:32.145]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:37.512]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:04:37.672 --> 00:04:42.778]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:46.020]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.222]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:54.745]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:04:54.825 --> 00:05:04.950]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.732]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
