[00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:01.099]  Right now!
[00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:19.164]  Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, who has flip-flopped on the hot potato issue of illegals immigrating into the US, sees a pot of gold at the end of the election rainbow by now catering to illegal voters.
[00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:25.167]  Kasich reportedly said to CNN, the 12 million who are here, we ought to find out who they are.
[00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:30.830]  If they've been law-abiding over a period of time, they ought to be legalized and they ought to be able to stay here.
[00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.531]  There are people who contribute a lot.
[00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.491]  To the US.
[00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:37.672]  Kasich must have missed the reason Trump is so popular in the polls.
[00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:42.493]  Americans are fed up with the slow transformation of their country into a third world.
[00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:58.057]  And when a lawmaker like Maryland Governor Larry Hogan puts into action a plan to create some kind of accountability for the tens of thousands of illegals with criminal records being released onto American streets, he is met with a horde of the now typical pro-illegal demonstrators
[00:00:58.237 --> 00:01:01.559]  Who have zero respect for our country and our laws.
[00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:11.564]  The group titled Casa de Maryland said Larry Hogan's voluntary collaboration will lead to the deportation of parents, siblings and neighbors while shredding community trust.
[00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:21.950]  As jails garner the reputation as locations around which ICE agents wait for release, family members will be too frightened to visit or retrieve their loved ones.
[00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.351]  Meanwhile, the hubris grows.
[00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:35.338]  A Dallas tree service owner that had already been raided by immigration authorities and warned not to continue to employ illegal aliens turned around and did so through shell staffing companies.
[00:01:35.838 --> 00:01:43.503]  Apollo's Davis Phillip now faces up to six months in prison because small business owners like himself believe that U.S.
[00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:45.084]  laws just don't apply.
[00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:50.166]  And that we should be thankful that they are doing the work Americans supposedly won't do.
[00:01:50.527 --> 00:02:00.652]  Besides, Americans are too busy standing in long lines at food banks that they have had to rely on since the Wall Street criminals deep-sixed the stock market back in 2008.
[00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:04.694]  Meanwhile, the rest of America, without blinders on, has to live in fear
[00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:14.663]  When they see stories like this, the brutal deaths of a grandmother and two teens in Florida earlier this week were pinned on an illegal alien who crossed the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:25.292]  Police in Fort Myers arrested Bolivian national Brian Omar Hyde, 19, Tuesday, driving on the wrong side of the road with no license and blood on his clothes and body.
[00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:35.099]  The Lee County Sheriff's Office suspects Hyde of carrying out the extremely violent slayings of his cousin and roommate, Lieutenant Matt Sands, described the grisly incident.
[00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.422]  It was an extremely violent scene, even for us, Sands said.
[00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:45.067]  All homicide scenes are normally violent, but this scene was what we considered unimaginable.
[00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:52.252]  According to the lieutenant, there were indications the victims died due to sharp force trauma, though no murder weapon was identified.
[00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:58.738]  According to Belize media outlets, Hyde and two other men were suspects in a double murder case back in October 2013.
[00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:07.501]  Hyde's uncle, Russell Hyde, is also reportedly a known criminal in Bolivia who is suspected of decapitating and dismembering two people in May.
[00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:14.103]  This is an example of the kind of illegal Kasich, Jeb Bush, and the Obama administration would have us all ignore.
[00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.323]  As if it's just one bad apple.
[00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:22.124]  Areas of New Mexico and Arizona are controlled by the drug cartels that deliver illegals to the U.S.
[00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:32.866]  Where mass murder, execution style slayings, sexual assaults, kidnappings, shootings, armed robberies, burglaries are all par for the course within the world of illegal immigration.
[00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:36.627]  As the Obama administration raises the flag over the U.S.
[00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:42.348]  Embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years, the message is loud and clear to the rest of the world.
[00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:43.768]  Come plunder America.
[00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:46.131]  Our laws don't apply to you here.
[00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:50.418]  We will divide and bring the American people to their knees together.
[00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:52.461]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:03:57.247 --> 00:04:03.372]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:06.695]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:08.417]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:14.703]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:20.728]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:24.629]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.893]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:38.214]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:39.314]  It's a war against the truth.
