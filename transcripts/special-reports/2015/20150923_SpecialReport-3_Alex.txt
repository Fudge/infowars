[00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:12.449]  America, remember when a young upstart Illinois Senator Barack Obama promised everything under the sun?
[00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.010]  Obama promised to cut the deficit in half.
[00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.031]  Well, it was $10 trillion then.
[00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.331]  It's over $18 trillion now.
[00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:35.595]  Obama promised shovel-ready American jobs, but as Obama's golf games increased and he spent millions of taxpayer dollars on his vacations, he ignored his jobs council, eventually disbanding it, and now we have an economy with more than one-third of the country on welfare.
[00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:57.240]  Not to mention an emboldened surveillance state, militarized constitution-despising police, a middle-class-destroying healthcare program, wide-open borders, huge foreign policy failures in the Middle East, Europe, and South America, an impending corporate world government courtesy of the TPP, and a nation increasingly divided on race.
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.625]  Basically, everything Obama promised was a big fat lie.
[00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:08.392]  His biggest achievement appears to be the ability to lead the American people along like lemmings.
[00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:20.977]  So who's the globalist strawman this time around?
[00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.240]  Could it be Donald Trump?
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.453]  The Washington Post reported that former President Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality television star
[00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:35.434]  We're good to go.
[00:01:55.288 --> 00:02:10.710]  So what would the strategy look like in order for Trump to buttress Hillary's presidential campaign as she struggles with the shackles of her latest debacle of an FBI email investigation where at least four of the emails on her private server were found to be classified?
[00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.132]  First, delay the Democratic presidential debate.
[00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:14.953]  Done.
[00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:18.615]  We won't see a Democratic presidential debate for over two months.
[00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:27.480]  And the handful of Democratic candidates are already complaining that the schedule of six primary debates are designed to allow Hillary to shine.
[00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.843]  Second, send in the Donald to stir up the Republican campaign.
[00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:39.308]  Test the waters by using promises and observations about America that Hillary can utilize later in her campaign.
[00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:45.292]  If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.
[00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:46.873]  You wouldn't even be talking about it.
[00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:57.286]  This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement and I said, Mexico is sending.
[00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:09.471]  And once Trump has dominated and weakened the Republican field with his faux populism, Trump can jump right off the Republican bandwagon and run as a third party candidate, further watering down Republican votes.
[00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:12.493]  Which is something Trump has already hinted at.
[00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:23.936]  Here we are again, debate season, when the candidates actually talk about the criminal conspiracy that has devoured our government and transformed it into a corporation masquerading as a democracy.
[00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:34.258]  Not to be mentioned again once they are in office, as this brief season of populism and reflection of American values morphs into a reign of tyranny.
[00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:58.155]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:00.696]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:02.977]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:06.378]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:10.579]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.380]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:16.441]  Everything that's been done
[00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:34.175]  With torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:35.997]  That's it.
[00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:45.644]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:50.165]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:59.107]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.528]  This is all about converting us
[00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:07.585]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
