[00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:05.201]  Let's just call it what it is, because we can.
[00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:15.646]  At the bare minimum, the coordinated massacre that just took place in San Bernardino, California was a jihad, as was the 2009 massacre that occurred at Fort Hood.
[00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:19.688]  But the media spun that one too, calling it workplace violence.
[00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:29.854]  ABC later reported, attorneys for the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood massacre said that the alleged shooter's admission that he gunned down his countrymen to defend the Taliban
[00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:37.036]  Proves that the assault was a terrorist attack and not, as the government had implied, workplace violence.
[00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:44.338]  But the bought and paid for media, its handlers and the Obama administration won't let up on their warping of reality.
[00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:51.300]  We received word that this shooting was not at a Planned Parenthood, so that's at least some perspective on where the shooting may be taking place.
[00:00:56.302 --> 00:01:10.468]  Within minutes of the shooting, a deluge of leftists on Twitter immediately blamed the massacre on white people, conservatives, Donald Trump supporters, the NRA, the Second Amendment, pro-lifers, and men in general.
[00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:17.350]  After the shooters were named as an Arab man and woman, progressives suddenly lost all interest in the story.
[00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:35.036]  While media would have us all shelter in place in gun-free zones to be picked off like scared little rabbits, gun sales skyrocketed days before the shooting, during Black Friday, breaking record background checks, and the whole debacle stinks of a false flag.
[00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:50.272]  Funded by the mysterious 50-plus billion dollars Americans blindly throw at the avalanche of liberty-devouring alphabet agencies illegally surveilling and manipulating the public consensus to keep the Big Brother machine rolling.
[00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:58.339]  The Inland Regional Center that was attacked in San Bernardino, California had been conducting active shooter drills for months.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.386]  The LA Times writes, At first, Dorothy Vong assumed it was a drill, just like all the others at her work.
[00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.189]  at the Inland Regional Center where she's a nurse.
[00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.194]  The staff works with clients and parents of clients who are sometimes angry.
[00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:16.397]  They have active shooter drills every month or so.
[00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:28.210]  The devout Muslim man and mail-order Pakistani bride that unleashed the coordinated attack at the Inland Regional Center had been creating remote-controlled bombs in their home.
[00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.154]  Predetermined preparation to commit violence on a large scale by two radicalized Muslims.
[00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:34.995]  That's right.
[00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.215]  Radicalized.
[00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.736]  Call it what it is.
[00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:49.845]  CNN reports Syed Rizwan Farooq, one half of the couple behind the San Bernardino shooting massacre, was apparently radicalized and in touch with people being investigated by the FBI.
[00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:54.607]  For international terrorism, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
[00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.847]  Not a workplace grievance, Washington.
[00:02:57.128 --> 00:03:00.689]  This has Jihad written all over it.
[00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:11.433]  In my humble opinion, we are reaching a point eclipsing any talk of impeachment or the evocation of the 25th Amendment, considering President Obama's sanity or lack thereof.
[00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:14.374]  We may have arrived at a point when Frank J. Larkin,
[00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.876]  Sergeant at Arms and doorkeeper of the U.S.
[00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:29.084]  Senate, being the only officer that can arrest the Manchurian candidate currently quarterbacking an American Jihad in the United States, must dust off the handcuffs and enter the Oval Office.
[00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:30.885]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:49.751]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forehood situation?
[00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:53.074]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:54.796]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:03:54.816 --> 00:04:01.102]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:01.222 --> 00:04:07.147]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:11.030]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.113]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:22.301]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:24.623]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:25.724]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:34.827]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
