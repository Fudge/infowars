[00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:10.637]  Hillary has kind of been doing such a bad job, the Democrats don't really have anybody, and Obama is toying with the idea of running for a third term.
[00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:14.540]  We want to put out a video that tells him to do it.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.263]  I already voted for you last year, so I'll vote for you again next time too.
[00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:20.144]  Or not last year, but last term.
[00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:23.807]  Obama, you should run for a third term because we need you.
[00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:24.648]  Obama's third term?
[00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:26.129]  No.
[00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.532]  Are you guys lined up to vote for Obama's third term?
[00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.869]  That way everyone's here in line?
[00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.092]  We need Obama to run for the third term.
[00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.877]  So I want the whole country to vote for Obama.
[00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:41.200]  Are you here voting for Obama's third term?
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.081]  Yes, of course.
[00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.505]  I honestly think, why not?
[00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:46.187]  Obama's the first black president.
[00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:48.190]  Why not be the first person in history to go three terms?
[00:00:49.377 --> 00:00:50.158]  How about Obama?
[00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:54.380]  I think Obama is going to give it a shot, but it's still pretty important.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.622]  I'm going to go with he's not going to get this one done.
[00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.223]  Obama to run for a third term?
[00:00:58.283 --> 00:00:58.463]  Boo!
[00:00:58.483 --> 00:00:59.023]  Boo!
[00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.985]  You forget what state you're in.
[00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:06.929]  I don't hate it, it sounds all right to me, but I'm American so that's all that matters.
[00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:15.067]  Well, if you love America, then you know the Constitution has a 22nd Amendment, and he can't run for a third term, even though he wants to!
[00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:17.089]  I don't care, but I didn't know he wanted to run.
[00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.433]  I'd say he did a good job, but I just don't think we need to have a president in office.
[00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.816]  You know, if we were to limit to like four terms,
[00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:26.897]  That wouldn't be too bad.
[00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:28.118]  Third term.
[00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:29.039]  Make it happen.
[00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.520]  Boom.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.920]  Boom.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.642]  Obama, run for a third term.
[00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:33.884]  We really don't want him to use the House.
[00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.565]  Do I think he can make it happen?
[00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:35.946]  Yes.
[00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.948]  Do we care about the amendments?
[00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:40.851]  Or the Constitution?
[00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.074]  I don't think it's an option, so I think we're okay.
[00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:45.955]  Obama, third term!
[00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:47.597]  It's for the kids!
[00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:48.218]  It's for us!
[00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:51.123]  No, I do not want that man for a third term.
[00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:53.625]  Our government can go ahead and burn itself down before I do.
[00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:55.026]  Sir, are you going to vote for Hillary?
[00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:56.146]  I ain't voting for any of them.
[00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.187]  That woman doesn't need to run either.
[00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:58.448]  Sir, are you going to vote for Bush?
[00:01:58.588 --> 00:01:59.729]  I ain't voting for none of them.
[00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.969]  You can't do that.
[00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.070]  Why?
[00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:04.331]  You can only do two terms.
[00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:07.393]  We just got to do away with that pesky 20-second amendment?
[00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:07.974]  Don't think so.
[00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:09.475]  Yeah?
[00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:10.715]  One more year?
[00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:11.256]  Can't do that.
[00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:13.473]  Sorry, I'm pro-America.
[00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.276]  There's a reason that Hillary Clinton is not up for this in charge of the United States.
[00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:27.461]  He has signed a lot of executive orders, and this is something that he thinks that it could be fun to kind of mess around with the amendments, and people want him to run for a third term.
[00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:29.082]  The Democrats have no one.
[00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.224]  That may be the case, but, you know, the Constitution's kind of important.
[00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:39.867]  If you don't vote for Obama for a third term, you're voting for Bush or Hillary, so... Well, like a different Bush?
[00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:40.148]  Yeah!
[00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:41.810]  Oh!
[00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:42.693]  Baby brother boy!
[00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:44.397]  Sounds like a Triple Lose situation to me.
