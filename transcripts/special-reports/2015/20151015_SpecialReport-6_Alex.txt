[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.636]  Well, we are witnessing a time of political upheaval, a staggering economy, wars and rumors of wars everywhere.
[00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:12.000]  And in fact, we're even seeing some auspicious signs in the heavens.
[00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:21.349]  Is there an ancient mystery that lies behind everything that we're witnessing from the rise and fall of the stock market to the rise and fall of nations?
[00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.211]  Well, my guest today hopes to possibly answer that question.
[00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:30.134]  This is Jonathan Cahn, and he's the author of two New York Times bestseller books.
[00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:34.696]  The first is The Harbinger, and then his new book, The Mystery of the Shemitah.
[00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:40.960]  It predicts a biblical pattern, which indicates that financial collapse may be coming in 2015.
[00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:49.368]  You know, when I wrote the book, people from Wall Street were contacting me and saying, someone was saying, there is a seven-year cycle.
[00:00:49.388 --> 00:00:56.073]  And when I looked after the book, they actually are identifying the seven-year cycle on the time of the Shemitah.
[00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:57.854]  But they have no idea what the Shemitah is.
[00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.495]  So, I'd say it's bigger than that.
[00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.597]  There are conspiracies, but this is bigger than that.
[00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:10.900]  When you look at the last 40 years, man, it's the greatest crashes or the collapsing of Wall Street, the long-term collapses, are the years 1973, 1980, 87, 2000, and 2007.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.761]  Every single one of them happens on a seven-year cycle.
[00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.022]  That's the Shemitah.
[00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.903]  Every single one of them happens at the time of the Shemitah.
[00:01:21.824 --> 00:01:29.915]  But not only that, if you look at the greatest collapses in world history, I mean, just in modern times, the top three, which is number three is 1937-1938.
[00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:30.836]  That's the year of the Shemitah.
[00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.839]  Number two is 2007-2008, the Great Recession, year of the Shemitah.
[00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.266]  Number one is the Depression.
[00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:42.087]  Greatest year is 1930-31, Year of the Shemitah.
[00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:44.868]  Every single one happens in this time period.
[00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.511]  And it even gets more precise because the amazing thing is the majority of them all happen at the same time of year.
[00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.993]  They happen at the time of the month of Tishri.
[00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:57.575]  That's why for years economists have been boggled.
[00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:01.516]  Why do all these great crashes happen around September-October?
[00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:03.137]  Well, that's the biblical month of Tishri.
[00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:06.739]  But it even gets more intense and stunning because
[00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:19.187]  If you look at the last two cycles, which is 2001 and 2007, the amazing thing is this phenomenon, or actually 2008, this phenomenon is getting more and more precise and more and more powerful or stunning.
[00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:20.508]  For example, 2001, 9-11 happens.
[00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.834]  It causes the greatest coin crash in world history.
[00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.616]  Well, when does that take place?
[00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:29.196]  It's September 17, 2001.
[00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.318]  That's the greatest crash.
[00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:32.599]  What day is that?
[00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:38.665]  That date is Elul 29, the exact day of the Shemitah that comes once every seven years.
[00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.529]  That's the day appointed to wipe out the financial realm in the Bible.
[00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.851]  The exact day, and it's a sign of judgment.
[00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:54.737]  If you go seven years into the future and you find you have the other greatest crash in world history to this day, September 29, 2008, greatest crash ever.
[00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:55.958]  When does that take place?
[00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:57.479]  On September 29th.
[00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.583]  In the biblical calendar, it's Elul 29, the exact same biblical day that comes once every seven years.
[00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.205]  So the two greatest crashes in world history
[00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:17.654]  Each happened exactly seven biblical years apart, down to the day, down to the hour, the minute, the second, on the day that's appointed, once in seven years, to wipe out the financial realm.
[00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:18.695]  So, I mean, this is stunning.
[00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:22.058]  I don't believe, no matter what, anybody could have put this thing together.
[00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:26.061]  I mean, that's how precise it is, down to the day and down to the seconds.
[00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.224]  The pattern of the last Shemitahs have been that
[00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:33.889]  Often at the beginning of the Shemitah, you don't notice anything, but there are often foreshadows.
[00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.815]  Well, the major thing, if something's going to happen, the major period is going to be coming up.
[00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.400]  It's always at the end of the Shemitah, as we approach September.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.942]  That's the time of that white bath.
[00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:47.206]  I'm not saying it has to happen, but I believe we need to be aware of it.
[00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:55.870]  And interesting, people who look at signs, one of the signs in the Bible of judgment is the darkening of the sun, or an eclipse.
[00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.631]  Not that it always is, but it can be.
[00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:05.734]  On the day that we get to the Wipeout Day, Elul 29, of this Shemitah cycle, the sun's going to be darkened at that time.
[00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:06.855]  The last time that happened was 1987.
[00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:15.181]  When the sun was darkened at Alul 29, it led into Black Monday, the worst day crash in world history.
[00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:29.474]  I believe we are going to watch, if we don't turn back, if this nation keeps on going on its course, we're going to watch the fall of America, or the shaking of America, and the American age that you and I, and all our listeners have known since we were born, is going to come to an end.
[00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:31.816]  And the Shemitah is very exact, very precise.
[00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:34.637]  And I believe this is a real warning that we need to be ready.
[00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:35.377]  Here's the thing.
[00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:38.839]  If you look at the year 1917, you have the year of the Shemitah.
[00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.321]  At the end of it would be this prophetic period that begins September 1917 to September 1918.
[00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:48.023]  Did anything significant happen with prophecy or restoration?
[00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:49.403]  Well, here's the amazing thing.
[00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:50.824]  In that exact period,
[00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:51.584]  I think?
[00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:19.036]  Seven Shemitahs later to the next seven Shemitahs, it gives you the period that is 1966 September to 1967 September.
[00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:25.839]  Right in the middle of that comes the next prophetic restoration, the Six Day War, when Israel regains Jerusalem.
[00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:32.801]  Well, here's the thing, I'm not being dogmatic, I'm not saying it has to be, but if we follow this one more time, where does it take us?
[00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:43.710]  It takes us to the Shemitah that we're in right now, that's the 7th Shemitah, and the period of prophetic restoration would be September 2015 to September 2016.
[00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:56.562]  Now again, not being dogmatic, but if it follows the pattern of what happened before, it would mean war, war in the Middle East, and a war resulting in the next piece or puzzle piece of prophecy.
[00:05:57.202 --> 00:05:58.123]  This is so big.
[00:05:58.164 --> 00:06:04.091]  I mean, we're talking about from our pocketbooks, our bank accounts, to our to America, to prophecy, to the end time.
[00:06:04.132 --> 00:06:05.794]  So it's very specific.
[00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:06.615]  It's very exact.
