[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.550]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.791]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash.
[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:08.172]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:09.033]  You're failures!
[00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:11.694]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag?
[00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.472]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with another update about Homan Square.
[00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:23.116]  Now Josh Owens and I went up there about a week and a half ago and we did some reporting about the atrocities that happened up there.
[00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:33.762]  The people being detained, not being able to call a lawyer, basically not given any kind of due process and then essentially released over maybe an 18 hour period to up to three days we've heard about.
[00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:34.442]  I think?
[00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:51.556]  We're good.
[00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:23.603]  So there's a lot of atrocities that are happening at this home and square and there's now a new person who has come forward and in an article by the Free Thought Project, his name is Jose Gonzalez and he claims that police threatened to inject him with heroin to get him to talk.
[00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:28.924]  Now this guy said he was sitting around at his home with his family in a no-knock raid style.
[00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:30.385]  They came busting through the door.
[00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:32.085]  They said they had a warrant.
[00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.106]  They wouldn't allow Jose to look at this warrant.
[00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:41.032]  They pushed his pregnant cousin to the ground and then they pointed their assault rifles at the kids and grandmother who were in the house.
[00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:45.295]  This is the kind of thuggery that happens from time to time with these no-knock raids.
[00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:49.379]  So, Jose was taken into custody and no drugs are found at the home whatsoever.
[00:01:49.959 --> 00:02:00.208]  They take him to Holman Square and they keep asking him about all these narcotic deals, all this drug business that's going on in the area and he says he has no idea about any of that whatsoever.
[00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:06.793]  And, uh, turns out that, uh, the Jose Gonzalez that they were looking for, because that is a pretty common name, was born in the 1960s.
[00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:12.337]  This Jose Gonzalez that they grabbed was only 27 years old, so obviously they had the wrong person.
[00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:21.425]  He said that the officers definitely wanted it to seem like people were beaten there, and that the red stuff that he had seen on the floor earlier when he was taken in there was, in fact, blood.
[00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:28.270]  So this man was kidnapped, taken hostage, and the officers threatened to inject him with heroin
[00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:36.456]  So he would talk and basically fess up to whatever drug charges that they were looking for and were unable to do so.
[00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:43.460]  Now we know that a man, his name was John Hubbard, was allegedly held there and he died from an accidental heroin overdose.
[00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:48.864]  Now knowing how they treat people there, that seems like that'd be impossible for him to shoot up while he was being held there.
[00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:55.686]  Because all the people that have been there thus far have been shackled with their hands there, and I doubt these guys aren't going through the pockets and checking.
[00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:09.411]  Now that we know that these guys are threatening people to inject them with heroin to get them to fess up to stuff, leads to the fact that maybe this guy was murdered at Holman Square by these undercover agents who are going around kidnapping people on the streets.
[00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:11.872]  So there's many questions that don't add up.
[00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:19.376]  And it just doesn't make sense that he could have accidentally taken, anyone who takes heroin almost instantaneously dies if they have an overdose.
[00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:24.639]  I mean, he could have taken them in capsule form and swallowed, but still, once it hit his stomach, that would have all happened instantaneously.
[00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.701]  And if he were to shoot up, it would have had to happen right there on the scene.
[00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:39.487]  So I doubt there's any way that this man would have been able to, in any kind of way, sneak in a needle with heroin in it already, you know, in the syringe, and then essentially while he's sitting there, shoot up.
[00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.510]  So, there's definitely some shady stuff going on.
[00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.519]  We're going to have to do a lot more digging and, you know, it leads us to think there's probably going to be a lot more of these sites that come to light that we find out about.
[00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.782]  So, stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:53.483]  I'm Joe Biggs.
