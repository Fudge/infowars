[00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.138]  We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:21.175]  The average member of Congress is worth 18 times the average American household, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
[00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:26.698]  The average net worth of a lawmaker is $1,029,505 in 2013, a 2.5% increase from 2012, whereas the average American's household is worth $56,355.
[00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:27.078]  Not only that,
[00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:45.589]  But 50.8% of Congress are millionaires.
[00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:57.736]  While the median net worth of an American family has declined by nearly one-third between 2007 and 2013, members of Congress have recovered quite well from the recession.
[00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:02.399]  The Senate's median net worth went from $2.3 million to $2.8 million over that period.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.325]  While for members of the House, the numbers went from 708,500 to 843,507.
[00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:26.961]  Overall, CRP's annual analysis of lawmakers' financial statements once again shows that they are not remotely similar to the typical American in terms of wealth, investments, and economic security.
[00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:36.526]  Whether voters elect them because they are successful or because people of modest means do not run, or for other reasons, is unclear.
[00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:42.909]  But struggling Americans should not assume that their elected officials understand their circumstances.
[00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.855]  Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream, my God, it's important.
[00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:09.324]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:11.664]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:14.465]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:18.606]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:22.106]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:29.368]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:33.689]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.530]  We are the true media.
[00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.291]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.032]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
