[00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:12.100]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:18.186]  And this report is an update on two reports that I've filed this month, basically, and the one I actually filed just over the weekend.
[00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:22.269]  The first one is about the little girl who died of the flu after taking the flu shot.
[00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.414]  Well, now there's another little girl that died, in addition to the numerous other cases that are out there.
[00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.557]  Somebody sent me this this morning and said, you have to look at this one.
[00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.119]  Here's the headline from the Daily Mail.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.723]  Girl 5 dies from strain of flu she was vaccinated against as deadly epidemic continues to sweep across the U.S.
[00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:41.824]  And this is something we're seeing everywhere.
[00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:47.747]  And the CDC comes out with this song and dance that I'm about to show you, where they say, well, we guessed the wrong strain of flu.
[00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:49.208]  They didn't guess anything wrong.
[00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.310]  They're deliberately putting this stuff in there so people get the flu.
[00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.471]  But we'll get more into that in a second.
[00:00:54.691 --> 00:01:02.335]  A 5-year-old girl has died in hospital three days after developing a strain of flu that she was vaccinated against as the deadly outbreak of the virus continues to sweep across the country.
[00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:06.456]  And once again, this article is filled with pictures of this beautiful little girl.
[00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:07.717]  She loved Frozen.
[00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:08.837]  She loved playing with her friends.
[00:01:08.857 --> 00:01:09.717]  She liked the color purple.
[00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:19.741]  They always put this stuff in there, and it really just tears at my heart reading these stories of parents who are trying to protect their kids from flu, and they think they're doing the right thing by getting the vaccine.
[00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:20.581]  Here's more.
[00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:28.531]  The youngster is the fourth child in a Nevada-based county and the 56th nationwide to have died in the flu in the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective.
[00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:39.004]  Kara's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three-quarters of people who had the injection, which contains strains of influenza A, this year will get the virus anyway.
[00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:46.431]  So even with all the hype about getting your flu vaccine, how it's everywhere in the media, everywhere in the news, you go to every drugstore, they're trying to get you to do your flu shot.
[00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:51.015]  You have 7-Eleven promoting workers to get their flu-fee shots.
[00:01:52.016 --> 00:02:00.704]  It's the worst performing ever since they've been recording this 10 years, 10 years now, that we're into this flu vaccine hysteria and tracking the results.
[00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:02.747]  So are you going to get the flu shot?
[00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:03.747]  Are you going to give it to your kids?
[00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.268]  I'm going to share with you a little story.
[00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.148]  This happened just this past weekend.
[00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.809]  Playing football out on the street with a bunch of my neighbors.
[00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.070]  And earlier, it was a week before that, my kids weren't allowed to play with their kids because they all had the flu.
[00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.190]  This one family.
[00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.711]  And in talking, they said, oh yeah, well we got all our flu shot injections and we still got it.
[00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.932]  And then another neighbor from across the street says,
[00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.201]  They all had their flu shots and three out of the four got the flu.
[00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:32.262]  And now let's turn to the measles outbreak.
[00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:33.803]  I just put out a report over the weekend.
[00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:38.705]  Disneyland measles outbreak caused by the vaccine?
[00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:45.709]  And I went through the statistics and the LA Times article saying that five people had gotten it that were vaccinated.
[00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.672]  Two out of the five workers that were vaccinated got the disease and that's only the ones that they tested.
[00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:53.392]  Well, now we got one more.
[00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:56.594]  Measles outbreak traced to Disneyland continues to grow.
[00:02:57.474 --> 00:03:00.236]  At least 85 cases are now confirmed in seven states.
[00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:06.218]  Alaska health officials are closely monitoring one-year-old Rivki Webb after she tested positive for measles this week.
[00:03:06.558 --> 00:03:09.900]  Her mother, Emily, said the family had just returned from a visit to Southern California.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.101]  Rivki had also just received the measles vaccine.
[00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:20.745]  And then you get to the end of this CBS News article, and you got a quote from the mother, who says, I want people to be aware
[00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.512]  And to vaccinate their kids, said Emily Webb, because the whole reason that she got sick in the first place was because people don't vaccinate.
[00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:32.153]  Well, if you vaccinate your kid, then she should be protected from the virus, right?
[00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:35.174]  Isn't that the whole reason they tell you to get these, and that they're safe and effective?
[00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:38.215]  Well, then your daughter gets it after she's been vaccinated.
[00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:44.317]  And I read in the insert, in three different spots, it says you could get measles or a measles-like rash.
[00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:46.918]  In the insert, as one of the side effects.
[00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:50.393]  And people still continue to do it because they don't ask for these inserts.
[00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:51.394]  It's amazing.
[00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:52.355]  Totally amazing.
[00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:54.076]  But here's Wired Magazine.
[00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:56.798]  Why did vaccinated people get measles at Disneyland?
[00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.680]  Blame the unvaccinated.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.403]  And this is medical arrogance at its finest right here.
[00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:07.467]  They claim because people aren't getting the vaccine that they're making the vaccinated people sick.
[00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:11.991]  Which just defies logic because supposedly if you're vaccinated, you're protected from the disease.
[00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:15.174]  But that's not the case, and we find that time and time again.
[00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:22.624]  And it's hard to find these, and that's why we really make a big deal out of it when we do see it, when we see people admitted that, hey, they were vaccinated, but they still got the disease.
[00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:29.152]  We need to make note of this, because they tell you time and time again that you should inject these foreign substances into your bodies, and it's going to protect you.
[00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:34.534]  We have to keep these people honest, because the CDC, that's their job, is to get more people vaccinated.
[00:04:34.614 --> 00:04:35.494]  That's the program.
[00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.476]  Because most of these CDC heads are former Big Pharma employees.
[00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:40.736]  And this is the whole thing.
[00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:47.779]  When I interviewed Dr. Sherry Tinpenny years ago, went up to her office, and she said, you know, Rob, this is what I think it is.
[00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.582]  I think that the reason they push these vaccines, especially on these young kids, is so they become lifelong customers.
[00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.044]  Because they're gonna see these other problems crop up.
[00:04:58.084 --> 00:05:05.230]  They may not have a serious adverse reaction, but they'll get something like allergies, or they'll get earaches, or they'll get tonsillitis.
[00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.913]  Something that keeps them coming back for more medical care.
[00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:16.578]  Over a hundred years ago, eugenicist social planners said that they'd use mind-altering drugs to control the population.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.985]  By 2007, more than 20 percent of the US population were on some type of prescription antidepressant.
[00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:39.066]  But in the case of foster children, a sector where the state has total control, at least two-thirds are forced to take a cocktail made up of, on average, seven psychotropic drugs.
[00:05:40.945 --> 00:06:01.561]  Chairman of the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians, Joe Burkett, testified before the Statehouse Select Committee hearing on psychotropic drugs in foster care and shocked the public when he said that two-thirds of foster children in Texas had been placed on psychiatric drugs because they were very, very sick from a bad gene pool.
[00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:05.123]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:08.406]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:14.741]  Besides the gene pools, they've then been traumatized by abuse, neglect, and problems, and then they've been traumatized by separation.
[00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:16.383]  All those things predispose to mental illness.
[00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:29.594]  One thing that I really like and I'm amazed by when I put out these vaccine reports is the number of people that get on the message board and actually add other clues and links to things that other people can read.
[00:06:30.194 --> 00:06:31.936]  Because I don't have time to put it all on one report.
[00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:33.437]  There's just not enough time in the day.
[00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:35.819]  So I really do appreciate when people put their links down there.
[00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:36.639]  And let's have a debate.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.001]  I'm all for an open, honest debate.
[00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:44.845]  You know, a lot of people sent this Penn & Teller thing, where they had them throwing bowling balls at little targets made up of children.
[00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:51.449]  And the ones that were vaccinated were protected from the bowling balls, and the other ones weren't, so they were getting mowed down.
[00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:59.254]  And a lot of the statistics that they're reporting, yeah, all these diseases were coming down, but they were coming down before the vaccines were ever introduced.
[00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:04.997]  They never show the beginning of these graphs, like when you see polio coming down to here, and then the vaccine's introduced, and it drops down to here.
[00:07:05.397 --> 00:07:06.578]  It was already on its way out.
[00:07:06.978 --> 00:07:07.679]  That's because of
[00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:14.922]  Modern hygiene techniques, modern plumbing, people not sleeping in their clothes over and over again days on end.
[00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:19.083]  It's a whole lot of things that caused these diseases to go down.
[00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:27.027]  So let's end here with this one article from VAC Truth that I encourage you to go and look at the other source articles that they put in here because it's amazing.
[00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:31.949]  Studies prove without a doubt that unvaccinated children are far healthier than their vaccinated peers.
[00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:39.156]  A 1992 immunization awareness study, IAS, conducted a survey to examine the health of New Zealand's children.
[00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:44.822]  Unsurprisingly, the results of their study indicate that unvaccinated children were far healthier than vaccinated children.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.122]  So they interviewed about 245 families, nearly 500 children participated in this survey.
[00:07:51.502 --> 00:07:52.242]  Here's what they found.
[00:07:53.063 --> 00:08:03.526]  92% of the children requiring tonsillectomy operation had received the measles vaccination, indicating that vaccination for measles may have made some of the children susceptible to tonsillitis.
[00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.628]  But then it goes into another study that was even more in-depth back in 2011 in Germany.
[00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:16.970]  In September 2011, German researchers carried out a long-range study, surveyed a total of 8,000 unvaccinated children from the ages of 0 to 19.
[00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:25.112]  So the kids that were vaccinated, 4.7% suffered from asthma, 10.7% suffered from hay fever, 13.2% suffered from neurodermatitis.
[00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:30.954]  With the unvaccinated children, you had asthma at 2.5%, hay fever at 3%, and neurodermatitis at 7%.
[00:08:31.254 --> 00:08:35.295]  Nearly half compared to the vaccinated children.
[00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.781]  And these aren't big health conditions, but these are things that determine quality of life.
[00:08:40.782 --> 00:08:47.992]  I wonder if the CDC has conducted or facilitated a study comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children yet.
[00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:48.733]  Have you done that?
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.443]  We have not studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:55.045]  Never mind.
[00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:55.725]  Stop there.
[00:08:55.805 --> 00:08:57.167]  That was the meaning of my question.
[00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:59.148]  You wasted two minutes of my time.
[00:08:59.168 --> 00:08:59.709]  Now look at this.
[00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:03.733]  Other conditions found to be almost non-existent in unvaccinated children.
[00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.655]  With dyslexia, it was 0.21 percent.
[00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:09.678]  Speech delay or articulation problems, 0.38 percent.
[00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:15.462]  Sensory Processing Disorder 0.28% Anxiety 0.25% Depression 0.12% Bedwetting 0.12% Celiac Disease 0.12% Gluten Sensitivity 0.41% GERD 0.06%
[00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:29.013]  I want to leave you with this.
[00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:31.234]  This last from the CDC.
[00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:37.278]  This is on their own website and this is talking about identified prevalence of autism spectrum disorder.
[00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:41.261]  In 2000 in the United States we were 1 in 150.
[00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:47.105]  And now in 2010, well now we're five years later so I bet it's even worse, it was 1 in 68.
[00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:54.450]  I've seen a chart that ranks the longevity of the 30 nations
[00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:03.065]  with the best mortality rates in the world, starting with Iceland, Sweden, Singapore, and on down.
[00:10:03.746 --> 00:10:04.607]  We didn't even make the top 30.
[00:10:04.928 --> 00:10:05.729]  We're the 34th.
[00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:12.641]  And ironically, we require more vaccinations than any other country that's healthier, has a less mortality rate than us.
[00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:26.486]  Do you see any correlation whatsoever, either one of you, to the 34th worst mortality rate and the most vaccinations to the ones with the least required vaccinations and the lowest mortality rate?
[00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:30.709]  There are many factors obviously involved in longevity for any country.
[00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:32.691]  The one thing we do know about vaccinations
[00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:40.457]  is that they are among the major public health reasons why generations today live much longer than in previous generations.
[00:10:40.517 --> 00:10:45.101]  They are perhaps the most successful public health movement in the world.
[00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:48.303]  Nobody's talking about or against vaccinations.
[00:10:48.643 --> 00:10:59.192]  We're talking about thimerosal in vaccinations and multiple bomb blasts of vaccinations in a short period of time.
[00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:01.230]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:11:11.223 --> 00:11:18.849]  You really need to do the research on vaccinations and we need to pressure these vaccine companies out there to do the obvious research.
[00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:20.610]  Let's look at all the problems.
[00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.014]  Let's not look at these carefully clinical studies that are paid for by the vaccine companies.
[00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:26.735]  Let's get some independent studies in there.
[00:11:26.935 --> 00:11:29.177]  Let's demand that our government do these independent studies.
[00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:31.819]  Let's demand that the CDC do these independent studies.
[00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:36.622]  Let's stop taking the vaccine company's word that everything is safe and effective, because it's not.
[00:11:36.742 --> 00:11:37.502]  We know it's not.
[00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.004]  And we can see these things time and time again.
[00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:44.106]  So it's time to start holding their feet to the fire and making them accountable for what they're doing.
[00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:45.967]  They have blanket immunity now.
[00:11:46.027 --> 00:11:51.711]  There's these vaccine courts that pay out the damages, but the vaccine companies never have to admit culpability.
[00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.132]  It's time to end stuff like this.
[00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:57.838]  If you like reports like these, please consider becoming a member of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:11:57.898 --> 00:12:00.260]  We're still running our biggest special ever.
[00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:06.826]  For $29.95, you can become a member of PrisonPlanet.TV for a whole year and share your username and password with up to 20 people.
[00:12:07.267 --> 00:12:09.989]  And remember, you've got to work on your immune system.
[00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:18.497]  That is what's going to protect you from these diseases, not hocus pocus from the vaccine community, especially those out there who are profiting from making the vaccines themselves.
[00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:26.785]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.167]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:31.950]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.113]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:39.576]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:46.862]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:58.107]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:12:58.287 --> 00:12:59.668]  We are the resistance.
