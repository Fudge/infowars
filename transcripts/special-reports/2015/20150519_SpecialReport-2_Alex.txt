[00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:11.584]  Jakari Jackson here, InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.685]  We have a new article on the site, House Bill seeks to eliminate online ammo sales.
[00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:30.788]  And this is a New Jersey representative, Bonnie Watson Coleman, and HR 2283, known as the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2015, and it would require face-to-face purchases of ammunition.
[00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:43.194]  And with our Second Amendment in the United States of America, I don't have any issue with you buying your ammunition over the internet, and I don't think that personal sales of firearms or ammunition require background checks.
[00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:48.256]  I know a lot of people want to have those on ammunition sales as well.
[00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:57.618]  I don't agree with this, because you could just as easily walk into Bass Pro Shop, Cabela's Academy, wherever, put down, you know, $1,000 by $1,000 worth of ammunition.
[00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:58.198]  Yeah, that's, you know,
[00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:17.103]  Catches people's attention, but it is very much legal in the United States of America and anybody would say well You know they're stocking up all this ammunition there and go out there and shoot somebody Oh, look what just happened in Garland, Texas, and I definitely hope that miss representative Coleman here
[00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:35.900]  Take a look at the Department of Homeland Security because I'm gonna bring up a throwback article from back in 2013 and the reason I'm bringing up this old article they have many more rounds of ammunition now but I like the point that Watson makes in this they had purchased enough ammunition to fight the war in Iraq for another 30 years
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.242]  And this is the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:44.008]  This isn't the military, you know, somebody, you know, they gotta be worried about some Red Dawn situation.
[00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:48.894]  This is the Department of Homeland Security has this massive amount of ammunition.
[00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.498]  I definitely hope somebody will take a look into that.
[00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:56.464]  Also DHS purchasing paper targets of pregnant women and little children.
[00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:00.006]  And when I say children, I'm not talking about some 17-year-old in a trench coat.
[00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.889]  I'm talking about a little 10-year-old boy who's holding his gun like this and smiling and grinning.
[00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.814]  And then we wonder why we have shootings like what happened to Tamir Rice when you're teaching these guys that, you know, some child could easily be your enemy and is out to kill you.
[00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.287]  So that's what's going on on that front.
[00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:31.372]  Also, they're trying to ban body armor in states like California, which I'm also against because, you know, just me doing the job that I do, myself, Joe Biggs, and some of the other crew members, we go out to very dangerous situations and sometimes we take body armor with us.
[00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.792]  And it's not everybody's like, well, you got to worry about the crowd.
[00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:37.033]  When I was out in Ferguson, I had little to no issue with the crowd.
[00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:41.655]  Like, yeah, there's some guy who wanted to argue me about how cool it was to burn down buildings and stuff.
[00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:46.515]  But by and large, I was more concerned about my safety from what the police were doing.
[00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:51.058]  The police were shooting rubber bullets, at least when we were there back in August.
[00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.399]  In November, they were much better behaved.
[00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.463]  But when we were out there in August, they were shooting rubber bullets indiscriminately into a blinding cloud of tear gas.
[00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:05.365]  And Joe Biggs, of course, got shot with a rubber bullet and had a nice big bruise to show for his efforts.
[00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:06.966]  So we have body armor.
[00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:07.986]  We have soft body armor.
[00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:08.527]  We have a hard
[00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:10.048]  I don't know.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.641]  Bulletproof vest for home defense.
[00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:26.442]  That's your business.
[00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:29.404]  I don't think the government should be able to tell you not to do that.
[00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:40.433]  And while we're talking about the DHS arming up with so many rounds of ammunition about people using these things for self-defense, let's also talk about the other things that are going on in our government.
[00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.436]  Let's start with running guns into Mexico with Operation Fast and Furious.
[00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:54.824]  New documents obtained by CBS News show Attorney General Eric Holder was sent briefings on the controversial Fast and Furious operation as far back as July 2010.
[00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:58.691]  That directly contradicts his statement to Congress.
[00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:04.264]  And for you guys who don't know about this, no, I'm not talking about Vin Diesel and all those guys.
[00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:11.967]  Operation Fast and Furious, which happened under the Justice Department, was a plan to give, well not just a plan, something that was actually implemented and done.
[00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:19.089]  They handed over functioning weapons to Mexican drug cartels to track the weapons.
[00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:27.712]  So I guess their logic was like, yeah, we'll let these guys take these guns, functioning guns, not malfunctioned or, you know, not deformed or any way.
[00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:31.310]  We'll give these guys the guns to go out there and commit crimes.
[00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.734]  And then when we catch these guns at the crime scenes, we'll know these guys, uh, were handlers of the guns.
[00:04:37.754 --> 00:04:45.220]  We'll be able to trace the guns back, which makes no sense because how many innocent people are going to die in this plan before it comes to fruition.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.982]  And also beyond that, you want to talk about arming of people.
[00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.824]  Let's talk about arming ISIS rebels.
[00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:52.505]  The article came out last year.
[00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:56.130]  Airdropping grenades into the hands of ISIS.
[00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.191]  And people will say this is not a big deal.
[00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.773]  A pallet of grenades is not going to take down the US military.
[00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:02.673]  I do agree.
[00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:06.455]  But what about all the innocent civilians who are unarmed in those regions?
[00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:07.816]  They have to conflict with this now.
[00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:09.797]  Disarming people isn't the way to go.
[00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:15.420]  And we saw this recently with the representative in Michigan, you know, shooting his shotgun at his ex-wife's car.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.801]  Jakari Jackson signing off.
[00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:20.423]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
