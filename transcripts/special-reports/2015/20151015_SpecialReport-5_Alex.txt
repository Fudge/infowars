[00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:10.639]  Every life matters, and that is why this issue is so important.
[00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.503]  Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter.
[00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:26.108]  How long before Black Lives Matter protesters are chanting George Soros' Divide and Conquer scheme is what matters?
[00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:43.674]  The Washington Times reports, liberal billionaire George Soros has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by non-profit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org.
[00:00:44.674 --> 00:01:01.417]  In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already established groups that embolden the grassroots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his non-profit Open Society Foundations.
[00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:13.539]  The sad fact is, one of the 30 richest people in the world, not an American civil rights leader, is funding a divide-and-conquer movement that has disrupted political speeches
[00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.685]  Places of business and the real progress Americans have made in the United States regarding race relations.
[00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:24.588]  Meanwhile, Soros has fueled the division in Ukraine.
[00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:29.172]  George Soros admitting he's behind the open border move and the illegals pouring in.
[00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:31.714]  Admitting he's behind Ukraine saying, I did it.
[00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:34.577]  Which I think he's taking too much credit.
[00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:35.277]  He's a big part of it.
[00:01:36.398 --> 00:01:39.780]  Saying they're part of the Arab Spring and turning loose all these groups.
[00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.002]  I mean, on every front, George Soros.
[00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:49.007]  If it was a racist nation, we would not have had the top guy ahead of law.
[00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:54.650]  As a black man, Eric Holder, and now Loretta Lynch, another black woman.
[00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.973]  We would not have the head of the United Nations, it was Susan Rice.
[00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:07.657]  You would not have a Secretary of State as Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell or others.
[00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:10.259]  So let's not call it a racist nation.
[00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.801]  If you want to point the finger, point it at Obama!
[00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:15.902]  Pointed at Holder.
[00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:24.450]  Pointed at that low-life man who never convicted one head of the White Shoe Boys.
[00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.432]  Too white for you, Eric?
[00:02:26.892 --> 00:02:30.976]  And we are distracted, just as the cloward-pivot strategy would have us.
[00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.218]  Of course, all lives matter.
[00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.342]  All lives matter.
[00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:40.144]  And I'm a black guy.
[00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.191]  Of course, chanting pigs in a blanket will lead to execution of police.
[00:02:53.752 --> 00:03:04.755]  I don't think chanting or singing chants that are basically promoting killing police officers is peaceful.
[00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:09.256]  And of course, inciting violence for the sake of violence is a trap.
[00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:12.337]  I would prefer to be remembered as a part
[00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:13.658]  Ultimately,
[00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:44.986]  The 13 million black babies that Soros supported being wiped out and the 41% welfare spending increase Obama has brought us are the real steps backwards.
[00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:56.396]  And those ensnared by the violent, elite-engineered full rights movement will eventually find themselves eager participants in a divide-and-conquer takedown scheme of the American dream.
[00:03:56.856 --> 00:04:04.818]  Funded by the very people responsible for the hostile environment the Black Lives Matter movement is fighting to escape from.
[00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:06.118]  All lives matter.
[00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:13.480]  That police officer that got killed by that black man because that black man listened to what y'all was saying by going out and killing white people.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.060]  That police officer's life mattered.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:24.402]  That nine-year-old girl in Ferguson, Missouri that got shot in the head while she was doing her homework in the drive-by shooting that none of y'all protested, her life mattered.
[00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:31.286]  So governments like to split people up, categorize human beings, divide so they can conquer them.
[00:04:31.686 --> 00:04:36.228]  There's people that don't even think that they can see the world because they need permission to see the planet Earth.
[00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.037]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
