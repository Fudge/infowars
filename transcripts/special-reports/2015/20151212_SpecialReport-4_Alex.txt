[00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:08.456]  Smart TV, meet your stupid consumer!
[00:00:08.997 --> 00:00:20.006]  Irvine, California based Vizio is churning out spy state televisions loaded with Vizio's Smart Interactivity Program to its 10 million and counting customers.
[00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:29.114]  A default program that follows your viewing habits and spins a web of data connected to your smartphone and any other device linked to your IP address.
[00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:34.420]  ProPublica reports IP addresses can increasingly be linked to individuals.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:47.815]  Data Broker Experian, for instance, offers a data enrichment service that provides hundreds of attributes such as age, profession, and wealth indicators tied to a particular IP address.
[00:00:48.155 --> 00:01:02.690]  Vizio recently updated its privacy policy to say it has begun providing data about customers' viewing habits to companies that may combine this information with other information about devices associated with that IP address.
[00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.475]  The company does not promise to encrypt IP addresses before sharing them.
[00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:12.378]  Of course, there are laws against this very overreach of Big Brother.
[00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:13.038]  U.S.
[00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:18.542]  Code Title 47 Chapter 5, Protection of Subscriber Privacy, and U.S.
[00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:25.186]  Code Title 18 Chapter 121, Wrongful Disclosure of Videotape Rental or Sale Records,
[00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.530]  Not to mention the Video Privacy Protection Act.
[00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.576]  But Vizio arrogantly declares those laws don't apply to them.
[00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:38.304]  Vizio vaguely claims IP addresses contain data rather than a person's identity.
[00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:42.050]  But that is the very nature of this surveillance beast.
[00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:55.437]  An IP address identification system increasingly used to build a profile of a person according to their viewing habits is a system already regarded as a breach of individual privacy in Europe.
[00:01:55.637 --> 00:02:01.400]  But Vizio reaffirms that the rat in a cage technology is all in the name of advertising.
[00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:07.424]  According to Vizio, the company's data mining programs are part of a revolutionary shift
[00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:15.666]  Across all screens that brings measurability, relevancy, and personalization to the consumer like never before.
[00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:17.967]  Again, personalization.
[00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.128]  The surveillance state is tracking us in our homes.
[00:02:21.888 --> 00:02:30.491]  All of the new washing machines, dryers, computers, iPhones, have cameras that are two-way, have audio that's two-way, and they admit they're tracking you.
[00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:46.974]  There is a report out of Wired Magazine with public statements by Petraeus, now the head of the CIA, that they are watching everybody through their appliances without warrants and they'll do whatever they want.
[00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:50.537]  And you're not a suspect, you're a person of interest.
[00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:53.119]  What, because we expose that you run Al-Qaeda?
[00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.160]  You mean stuff like that?
[00:02:55.976 --> 00:03:01.561]  So these people are just going into a new phase of flaunting it all in our face.
[00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:21.458]  Spying on us through our cable boxes and televisions, monitoring and determining our energy usage, the surveillance state is so completely out of control in its widespread violation of our Fourth Amendment rights, billion-dollar surveillance blimps are having to be shotgunned out of the sky by law enforcement.
[00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:23.419]  Vizio is playing with fire.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.326]  All it's going to take is one of their 10 million customers identities to be positively profiled and the first domino will fall.
[00:03:32.187 --> 00:03:37.331]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:39.818]  Even when the set is turned off.
[00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.641]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:48.666]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.428]  The poor and the underclass are growing.
[00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.391]  Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
[00:03:56.092 --> 00:04:02.117]  They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
[00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:04.378]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:22.760]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.081]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:27.821]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:34.103]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:40.105]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:44.027]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:47.108]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:55.291]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.612]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:58.713]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:59.073 --> 00:05:07.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
