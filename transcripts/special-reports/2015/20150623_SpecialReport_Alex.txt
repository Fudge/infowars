[00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:08.791]  The epidemic of black-on-white cowardly attacks on the elderly and disabled continues.
[00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.395]  A 76-year-old woman robs of her purse, then punched and thrown to the ground.
[00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:21.101]  Police in Omaha have arrested one of the individuals seen brutally punching a 76-year-old woman in a video that went viral earlier this week.
[00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.702]  The incident occurred last Sunday morning at St.
[00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:24.903]  Cecilia's Cathedral.
[00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:32.687]  The elderly lady is seen on a security camera picking up a pamphlet before she is blindsided by two thugs, one of whom steals her purse.
[00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.009]  The other individual then punches the woman full force in the head.
[00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.751]  She collapses to the ground and subsequently had to be taken to the hospital.
[00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:45.753]  Police arrested 22-year-old Wayman Clark, the individual seen throwing the punch in the video.
[00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.573]  The man who stole the woman's bag remains at large.
[00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:52.814]  Court records show that the suspect has a lengthy list of minor arrests.
[00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.295]  Clark's mother was also arrested for harboring a fugitive.
[00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:02.297]  Black-on-white violent crime captured on videos that go viral now appears to be an almost daily phenomenon.
[00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:05.778]  Teenagers attacking random strangers, then running away.
[00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:10.746]  It's been reported in cities like Milwaukee, Chicago, St.
[00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:12.706]  Louis, and now Lansing.
[00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:16.147]  But Weaver says this wasn't the first time he played it.
[00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:21.268]  Before he was caught, he and his friends had attacked random people on several occasions.
[00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:22.748]  Not many, I'd say.
[00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.109]  Overall, like six or seven.
[00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.630]  I mean, we don't try to rob them or anything.
[00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.730]  It's just...
[00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:35.859]  And have picked up steam since the Black Lives Matter movement came to prominence.
[00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.961]  A movement that a recent poll shows only 31% of black Americans support.
[00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.321]  What is knockout?
[00:01:42.782 --> 00:01:50.104]  The game knockout is like when people board it, like they all try to see where their heads goes at and whoever comes walking down the block or something, they just knock them out.
[00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:54.786]  You just knock them out, you hit them with a blow, and you take their belongings.
[00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:59.028]  Knockout is like when you just punch somebody and they knock, like they go to sleep when you hit them.
[00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:04.827]  For years, the press has referred to such incidents with the downplaying title of the knockout game.
[00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:09.370]  If white people beat up black people, it's a horrible racial incident, right?
[00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:10.391]  Horrible.
[00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:15.134]  And it's been happening in our country for... throughout the history of our country.
[00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:21.418]  Now, when black people beat up white people, and another black guy, it's not a racial attack.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.901]  It is.
[00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.797]  Violence against anybody because of their race would be totally unacceptable.
[00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.660]  I don't even see why people think that way anymore.
[00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:48.378]  Mainstream media provides us with a divisive tone reverberating from the mouths of political leaders struggling to gain a foothold in popular opinion by the age-old technique of divide and conquer.
[00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:57.866]  While others assert that they represent a disturbing trend of violent criminals feeling emboldened to attack white people in the belief that it is somehow justified.
[00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.808]  And in respect for the peaceful protest, I want to say hands up, don't shoot, black lives matter.
[00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:10.171]  That's 25-year-old Corey Mosley you can see walking through the Walmart on Rogers Avenue in Fort Smith carrying an aluminum baseball bat.
[00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.433]  Then, Mosley spots an 18-year-old female, alone, looking at CDs.
[00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:17.274]  You can see what happens next.
[00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.955]  It's a miracle the young lady, you know, was not
[00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.137]  Very, very seriously hurt.
[00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.060]  Police say it was a random attack.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.791]  There's no patterns, there's no prior relationships, there's no prior contacts, which really makes this more disturbing than anything.
[00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:33.334]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.672]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.993]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:51.794]  Here we go, folks!
[00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:52.734]  I'm being assaulted!
[00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:58.956]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:05.062]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless and security sticking their hands down their pants on the streets?
[00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:08.945]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:12.048]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:20.236]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:22.558]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:23.679]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:32.751]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
