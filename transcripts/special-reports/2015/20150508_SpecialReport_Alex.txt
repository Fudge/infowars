[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.514]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[00:00:02.614 --> 00:00:04.758]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash.
[00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:08.124]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:09.006]  You're failures!
[00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.670]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag?
[00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:15.237]  So see, they're lying to us.
[00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:22.862]  Their own Jade Helm handout says the things we've said, and then they tell the media it doesn't exist.
[00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:26.404]  Are you going to use our local people to help with that?
[00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:31.848]  So, we're not training any type of law enforcement during this training exercise.
[00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:32.568]  It's not happening.
[00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:40.053]  The only coordination now that will take place is we're just letting them know, hey, here's what happened the last 24 hours, here's what's happening the next 24 hours.
[00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:49.340]  Because there are times where we ask, at times, the law enforcement folks to do a traffic stop for us.
[00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.755]  To check our guys to see why they're doing what they're doing, when they're doing it, and why they're doing it.
[00:00:55.995 --> 00:01:01.379]  Then they came to Austin and Bastrop and said none of this was true and they never said it and laughed at us.
[00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:02.360]  Should we play the clip?
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.441]  We've got that cut out, right?
[00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.143]  Now we're talking about role players and you mentioned the role players.
[00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:08.825]  I'm curious as to how you guys came about these role players.
[00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:13.189]  As far as the role players go, they are going to be service members.
[00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.712]  We can't do the exercise without the public's help.
[00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:24.231]  Uh, things that we look for, uh, from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role player.
[00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.854]  The colonel, with this guy behind him puppeting him, says, no, we're not going to be in the town.
[00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:32.937]  RRTs are a training that is conducted off of the federal reservation.
[00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:35.840]  It's done on private property.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.601]  And how will we know that it's
[00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:40.958]  And they may be driving civilian vehicles throughout the area.
[00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:46.320]  So really, within the city limits, if you notice my guys, they're probably really doing something wrong.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.160]  It's just crazy.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.141]  We should call it the lies of Jade Helm.
[00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:12.687]  But suppose it should come up, who has the supreme voice?
[00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:13.327]  You?
[00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:14.748]  It's the community.
[00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.109]  It is the community, sir.
[00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.835]  So if you guys tell us, hey, we have something going on and we don't need you guys or we don't want you guys.
[00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:24.616]  Sir, it's truly an invitation.
[00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:30.561]  My name is Casey DeClew and my question is more posed towards the Commissioner's Board.
[00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:37.666]  As citizens, since we are so disturbed by this training, is there anything that we can do to reverse this decision?
[00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.571]  We should be able to.
[00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.392]  Can we vote?
[00:02:43.412 --> 00:02:44.994]  Do we need to protest?
[00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:47.376]  What can we do to have our voices heard?
[00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:51.321]  Well, I think, Mrs. Blue, your voices have been heard today.
[00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:56.086]  And we thank you for that.
[00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:59.809]  I can't say what the court would do about it.
[00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:12.324]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:15.905]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:19.047]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:26.450]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.311]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:34.792]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:40.833]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:03:40.873 --> 00:03:44.614]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.295]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:48.795]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:50.176]  It's time to take action.
[00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:51.936]  It's time to filter our water.
