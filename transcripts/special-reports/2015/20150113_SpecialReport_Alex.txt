[00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.374]  Hackers claiming to be aligned with Islamic State militants took control of the U.S.
[00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.575]  Central Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts just after noon today.
[00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:29.859]  The background and profile photos of the sent-com accounts were both changed to show an apparent militant and the phrases, cyber caliphate and I love you ISIS.
[00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.800]  The hackers have threatened U.S.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.840]  soldiers saying,
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.781]  We're good to go.
[00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:53.132]  Instead, it is taking appropriate measures to address the matter.
[00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:54.373]  Forget cyber laws.
[00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:57.516]  This is the countdown to an internet kill switch.
[00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:06.786]  The group conveniently took over Central Command's accounts just as the President was delivering a speech on new cybersecurity proposals this afternoon.
[00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:11.751]  In recent days, experts have been warning about a coming cyber Pearl Harbor.
[00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:19.155]  And in an interview for PBS, Edward Snowden discussed how the new military weapon is cyber weaponry.
[00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:30.122]  The NSA whistleblower revealed just how easily the United States could be compromised if hackers targeted core routers that connect virtually every industry in America.
[00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:36.006]  When it comes to cyber warfare, we have more to lose than any other nation on earth.
[00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.181]  Now when Sony was hacked, cyber security experts said that there was no way that North Korea could have done it, and it was more likely an inside job.
[00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:50.731]  The FBI, however, continues to assert that according to its expertise, it was North Korea.
[00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:51.572]  Period.
[00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.874]  Now how do we know that CENTCOM hasn't hacked itself?
[00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:58.995]  Wouldn't that be the easiest way to enforce an internet kill switch?
[00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:00.715]  This is the U.S.
[00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.336]  Central Command being hacked.
[00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:07.057]  Now no doubt this latest hack will keep officials on high alert.
[00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:15.619]  The NYPD and FBI issued alerts today after ISIS re-released a video calling for attacks of intelligence officers,
[00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.461]  Police officers, soldiers, and civilians in the U.S.
[00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:23.703]  Federal law enforcement agencies are taking the threats seriously.
[00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:30.446]  But it's not just ISIS using the momentum from last week's radical Islamic rampage in Paris to further their agenda.
[00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:43.472]  The West has wasted no time calling for CISPA-style legislation and information sharing, and you can expect to see this issue of cyber security propagated heavily in the President's upcoming State of the Union address.
[00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:00.076]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:03:00.156 --> 00:03:01.337]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:03.058]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:08.301]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:15.266]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.547]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:24.289]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.551]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
