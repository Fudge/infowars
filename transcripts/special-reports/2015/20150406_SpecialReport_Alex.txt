[00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:19.114]  Inside of the house, they located a body of a male individual, Caucasian, mid-40s, who appeared to be deceased.
[00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:20.456]  They contacted paramedics.
[00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:21.036]  L.A.
[00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:25.841]  City paramedics responded, checked the individual, and confirmed that he was in fact deceased inside of the house.
[00:00:26.357 --> 00:00:32.059]  Andrew Getty, grandson and heir to the fortune of oil baron J. Paul Getty, is dead.
[00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:43.242]  A law enforcement source told the LA Times that Getty was found naked from the waist down in the bathroom of his Hollywood Hills estate and appeared to have suffered from some type of blunt force trauma.
[00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:47.724]  It's unclear whether the injury was caused by a fall or something else.
[00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:53.546]  A woman found in the Los Angeles home when Getty's body was discovered by police is being questioned.
[00:00:53.806 --> 00:01:01.089]  The same woman, Andrew Getty, worth $2.1 billion, sought a restraining order against two weeks ago.
[00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.451]  In 1966, the Guinness Book of World Records named J. Paul Getty the world's richest private citizen.
[00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.533]  Getty's legacy as a hoarder of wealth and antiquities is unparalleled.
[00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:21.481]  He was so miserly it cost him his grandson's right ear when he would not pay the Italian gangsters the $17 million ransom they demanded.
[00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:27.065]  During the Great Depression, Getty shrewdly diversified his ownings, picking up American oil companies.
[00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:29.727]  Oil reserves were discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938.
[00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:30.548]  Just 11 years later,
[00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.012]  Jay Paul Getty plunked down 9.5 million in cash on a tract of barren land on the border of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:48.873]  $30 million and four years later, that tract was producing 16 million barrels a year.
[00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:57.275]  The Russian oil goliath, Buchan, bought Getty Oil in 2000, sold it in 2011, and Getty Petroleum Oil spiraled into bankruptcy.
[00:01:59.133 --> 00:01:59.413]  An L.A.
[00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.895]  County coroner says the death appears to be from natural causes.
[00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:07.278]  It was originally thought to be accidental because of medication found at the scene.
[00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:08.699]  Why blunt force trauma?
[00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.841]  Why is a hostile woman cooperating with the LAPD?
[00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:15.503]  Why were there massive amounts of blood all over the crime scene?
[00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:19.786]  And last but not least, was Andrew Getty really murdered?
[00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:22.868]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:31.436]  The facts are in.
[00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:32.736]  The studies are legion.
[00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:40.381]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:44.003]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:44.764]  Simple.
[00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:49.347]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.889]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.111]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
