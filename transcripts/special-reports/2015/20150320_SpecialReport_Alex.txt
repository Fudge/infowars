[00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:12.619]  We're here at South by Southwest.
[00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.080]  We just finished the demonstration over at McDonald's talking about GMO food.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.481]  And McDonald's isn't the only one.
[00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:19.062]  They're just a very visible presence here.
[00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:31.368]  And we're very interested to find out that here at the conference at the festivities of South by, they actually had a GMO panel discussion, but maybe discussion isn't the proper word because there was an anti-GMO group that was invited to speak.
[00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:33.929]  And then when it came down to it, we're denied access.
[00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.551]  So let's just talk to the people here at South by and see what they think about what's in their food.
[00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:42.685]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.927]  What do you think about GMOs in the food?
[00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:46.408]  I think they're awful.
[00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:47.750]  I think they're awful?
[00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.870]  Yes.
[00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.610]  Why do you think they're awful?
[00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:50.272]  I really don't know.
[00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:50.592]  Oh, okay.
[00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:54.295]  Alright, well, he thinks they're awful, so I think that's a start in the right direction.
[00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.800]  Yeah, you're going all the way.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.341]  Uh-oh.
[00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.082]  Yes, I'm rocking now!
[00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:04.863]  Yeah, you're rocking it!
[00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:10.448]  I mean, it's a pretty wide topic, but, you know, I've thought a lot about it.
[00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:11.489]  I'm not really for
[00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:21.422]  Genetically modifying foods, but then it seems like it's more or less necessary at this point to support such a large population that we have globally.
[00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:30.045]  I think that some of the ways that they're pursuing it, especially down in South America, is irresponsible.
[00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:31.806]  What do you think about GMOs and foods?
[00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.927]  Genetically modified organisms.
[00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:35.147]  I know what they are.
[00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:40.309]  I think that I try to avoid foods with GMOs, but I'm not super vigilant about it.
[00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.012]  Well, you know, these are your children, right?
[00:01:42.052 --> 00:01:42.992]  Would you watch your child?
[00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:44.773]  If you sat there and you watched your child?
[00:01:44.793 --> 00:01:47.234]  I make my kids some McDonald's and I'm totally against GMOs.
[00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:52.877]  I think it's crazy that they have a booth in there that's trying to talk to people and they have all the corn growing.
[00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:53.477]  Really?
[00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:56.138]  Yeah, we come from Monsanto land, so, I mean, I'm from Missouri.
[00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:57.279]  Oh, okay, so you know all about it.
[00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.979]  Right, right.
[00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.680]  They have a big McDonald's tent over there.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.501]  Do you guys plan to eat at that McDonald's tent?
[00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:06.023]  I walked over there, the line's extremely long, so maybe I'll go back when they get their nuggets.
[00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.291]  The nuggets?
[00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:13.075]  Well, did you know that the nuggets have a type of compound in it that's the same thing as found in breast implants?
[00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:14.176]  Yeah, that's what kept me.
[00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:17.358]  You know that new ad that they did with the little sprinkle thing?
[00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.202]  Almost going to buy it, but I was like, no.
[00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:22.982]  My 11-year-old schooled me.
[00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:23.523]  I was like, no.
[00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:28.787]  In just the few minutes we've been out here asking people these questions, they seem to be very responsive to what we're telling them.
[00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:32.530]  They are aware of GMOs, most of them, and will try to avoid them in the future.
