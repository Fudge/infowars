[00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:12.004]  Forget about curbing junk food.
[00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.866]  Just get more exercise.
[00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:18.452]  That's the biased message coming out of some Coca-Cola-funded obesity research.
[00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:27.323]  The megacorporation is under fire for donating millions of dollars to a non-profit that's been spreading this message in medical journals and through social media.
[00:00:27.683 --> 00:00:38.755]  Most of the focus in the popular media and in the scientific press is, oh, they're eating too much, eating too much, eating too much, blaming fast food, blaming sugary drinks, and so on.
[00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:44.041]  And there's really virtually no compelling evidence that that, in fact, is the cause.
[00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:56.470]  The Global Energy Balance Network says there is strong evidence that the key to preventing weight gain isn't about reducing food intake, but maintaining an active lifestyle and eating more calories.
[00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:02.795]  To back up this claim, they provide links to two research papers, each of which contain this footnote.
[00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:07.159]  The publication of this article was supported by the Coca-Cola Company.
[00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:13.705]  The creators of GEBN say they just wanted to raise awareness about both sides of the energy balance equation.
[00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:19.151]  The group disclosed that they'd received an unrestricted education gift from Coca-Cola.
[00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:29.902]  So clearly, the Global Energy Balance Network is nothing more than a front group meant to deflect attention away from recent studies about sugary drinks and their link to obesity and type 2 diabetes.
[00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:38.566]  This clash comes in a period of rising efforts to tax sugary drinks, remove them from schools, and stop companies from marketing them to children.
[00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:43.988]  As people have learned about the effects of sugary drinks, consumption levels have dropped by 25%.
[00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.550]  But does funding research lead to bias?
[00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.574]  Well, a recent analysis of beverage studies found that those funded by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association, and the sugar industry
[00:01:56.914 --> 00:02:04.598]  We're five times more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies without financial conflicts.
[00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.321]  You might find this a little bit reminiscent of the tactics used by the tobacco industry.
[00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:14.564]  They enlisted experts to become merchants of doubt about the health hazards of smoking.
[00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:19.727]  And you've probably heard that aspartame causes cancer, even though it's FDA approved.
[00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:26.149]  However, PepsiCo just removed the artificial sweetener from Diet Pepsi, suggesting there's something iffy about it.
[00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:34.692]  And let's not forget how one provocateur, using valid study results, was able to fool some reporters into writing that chocolate aids weight loss.
[00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.713]  So how can we trust junk food science?
[00:02:38.214 --> 00:02:40.875]  Be smart, be skeptical, and the bottom line?
[00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:47.477]  The best foods that are out there for our health and for our weight, for everything, need no scientific claims.
[00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:05.041]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.382]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:10.183]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:14.324]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.805]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:25.087]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:36.350]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.890]  We are the resistance.
[00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.531]  You are the resistance.
[00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.451]  You are the info war.
[00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:45.753]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:47.613]  We are the true media.
[00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:50.334]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:50.434 --> 00:03:54.015]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
