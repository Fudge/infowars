[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:32.068]  That was a clip that we showed you a few months ago about a self-driving car and for reasons I don't quite understand, this man has so much trust in this vehicle as it would stop and not run into him as we saw in the clip.
[00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.432]  And now we actually have a Google car involved in this first accident involving injury.
[00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:39.334]  Now to be fair, it wasn't the Google car's fault.
[00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:41.235]  It was involved in a rear-end collision.
[00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.236]  Somebody hit it.

[00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:06.731]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:12.097]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
