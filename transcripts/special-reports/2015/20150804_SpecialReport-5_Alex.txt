[00:00:04.028 --> 00:00:15.958]  With the clock ticking on 18 months left in his presidency, President Obama is determined to cause considerable damage to the Second Amendment rights of the good citizens of the United States before he leaves office.
[00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:25.266]  I've been very clear that an assault rifle ban, banning these high-capacity clips,
[00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:32.680]  Background checks, that they're a set of issues that I have historically supported and will continue to support.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.801]  Will there be resistance?
[00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:35.582]  Absolutely, there will be resistance.
[00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:40.305]  I'm going to be putting forward a package, and I'm going to be putting my full weight behind it.
[00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:58.244]  The push is intended to bring Social Security Administration in line with laws regulating who gets reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to prevent gun sales to felons, drug addicts, immigrants in the country illegally and others.
[00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:13.427]  A potentially large group within Social Security are people who, in the language of federal gun laws, are unable to manage their own affairs due to marked subnormal intelligence or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease.
[00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:23.249]  Roughly 4.2 million Social Security beneficiaries will be dropped into the same database system that the Veterans Administration is using to come and take it.
[00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.990]  My primary care physician called to have a wellness check.
[00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:31.355]  Uh, placed on me and the local police perform a wellness check.
[00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:35.078]  Well, the local police came up and there was nothing wrong with me.
[00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:38.461]  I had no, um, you know, there was no anxiety.
[00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.222]  I wasn't, uh, competitive.
[00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:45.206]  Uh, I basically, but I wasn't, I wasn't with anybody, so I had no witnesses.
[00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:46.588]  And they didn't have a warrant.
[00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:50.511]  And they, uh, through intimidation,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:08.386]  Forcefully, uh, commandeered my vehicle and entered my home, searched and seized my weapons, and, um, then, you know, carted me away in an ambulance to, uh, a psychiatric evaluation, which I was held for 72 hours.
[00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:22.732]  Determining whether someone is unfit to carry a gun will be open to sloppy interpretation as it could include those who don't pose a danger to anyone, but may not be able to remember names quickly or balance their checkbook.
[00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:28.238]  Databases are being created on every red-blooded American whether you own a firearm or not.
[00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.860]  The New York Post reported,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:41.608]  Unbeknownst to most Americans, Obama's racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school.
[00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:45.831]  All to document inequalities between minorities and whites.
[00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.312]  Hang on for a second.
[00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:52.275]  Obama, your white mama is of mostly English ancestry.
[00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:54.656]  You are essentially a white man.
[00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:57.058]  You're not Martin Luther King.
[00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:07.766]  We'll one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.547]  I have a dream today!
[00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:17.833]  The American people were making racial progress long before you and your merry band of socialist divide-and-conquer engineers showed up.
[00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:23.638]  And I personally resent that you would have me divided from my fellow Americans, whom I love.
[00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:29.442]  While our borders are wide open and we are increasingly under attack by foreign and domestic terrorism,
[00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:42.625]  Not by veterans or grandpa protecting his small piece of the American pie, but by radicalized Muslim extremists and pharmaceutically induced psychotic Americans, all of which are roaming around gun-free zones.
[00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.546]  Obama wants our guns?
[00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.727]  I can't think of a time when Americans needed them more.
[00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:52.468]  And according to the recent explosion of gun sales, neither can Americans.
