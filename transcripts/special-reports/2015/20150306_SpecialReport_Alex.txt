[00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:20.839]  Rob Dew reporting on the steps of the Texas State Capitol where today we have the National Vaccine Information Center is on site actually doing some lobbying for specific bills that are being introduced in Texas.
[00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.301]  Right now across the nation there are 74 bills dealing with vaccines.
[00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:26.343]  Only about eight are pro-freedom.
[00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:30.808]  Most of them are lacking in privacy and conscientious beliefs.
[00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:33.211]  These are trying to be eviscerated across the country.
[00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.217]  Here in Texas, there's about 10 bills so far this year, and only one of them is pro-freedom.
[00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.718]  I'm just going to go over the list of bills here.
[00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.320]  HB 1674 requires physician counseling.
[00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:46.005]  For conscientious and religious belief exemption.
[00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:51.430]  That means they're going to bring a physician in to kind of brainwash you if you decide you don't want to get vaccines for you or your children.
[00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:57.957]  SB 547 requires posting of exemption numbers on the internet by schools and the Department of Health.
[00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:04.980]  HB 1593 requires all public schools to provide parents the number of students enrolled not fully vaccinated.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.807]  And then we have SB 29 and HB 465, essentially the same thing, makes inclusion into the vaccine tracking system automatic and removes the current opt-in consent requirements.
[00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:16.708]  We're good to go.
[00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:38.332]  Young women and young men with the Gardasil vaccine.
[00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:41.093]  That's right, they've now created a Gardasil vaccine for men.
[00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:46.854]  HB 1185 adds advanced practice nurses to those that can sign a medical exemption form in Texas.
[00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:51.856]  HB 2006, this is introduced by Jason Villaba up in Dallas.
[00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.977]  It eliminates conscientious exemptions to vaccinations.
[00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:55.837]  They're going to take that
[00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:57.138]  We're good to go.
[00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:25.800]  The Texas State Capitol was enveloped in a cloud of mist, just as the safety and effectiveness of vaccines truly is.
[00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:45.673]  In addition to the draconian HB2006, which will eliminate conscientious exemptions to vaccinations, four other bills, SB547, HB1593, SB29, and HB465, are all about eliminating privacy and broadcasting to the public who has been vaccinated and who hasn't.
[00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.375]  This will create an anti-vaxxer blacklist.
[00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:54.681]  That's why I came down here, just to remind these people, give them a little civics lesson that they seem to have forgotten.
[00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:59.346]  They're talking database, computer lists, tracking.
[00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:00.167]  Hello!
[00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.228]  You know, that's not the American way.
[00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:06.232]  What they're talking about is the Communist Manifesto here.
[00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:08.775]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.979]  And this granny is going to speak her mind as much as she can.
[00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:22.041]  And then there's HB 1674 which will require physicians to actually scare you into taking your vaccines even though you've already said you don't want them.
[00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:26.067]  These are all examples of the tyranny coming down if you don't get active.
[00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.913]  We did go to the office of Representative Jason Villoba out of Dallas.
[00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:37.395]  He's a Republican and he wrote House Bill 2006 which removes the conscientious exemption from the vaccination schedule.
[00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:48.998]  So that would not allow you, unless you had a reason, a medical reason or religious exemption, to opt out of vaccinations, the mandatory vaccination schedule, which is pretty horrendous in the state of Texas.
[00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.538]  So this would knock that out.
[00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:52.499]  He lists in his press release that since 2003
[00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:59.605]  The number of unimmunized students attending Texas public schools has grown from 2,000 to nearly 40,000.
[00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:09.115]  To me that means a lot more parents are waking up to the dangers of forced vaccination and they either want to delay the scheduling or opt out of some of the shots altogether.
[00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:12.979]  Some of which aren't even light threatening like the rotovirus or the chickenpox virus.
[00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:23.185]  He also lists that he consulted physicians, parents, PTAs, immunologists, experts, and his own wife, and that he believes he must act to prevent the kind of outbreaks that we're seeing in California and Illinois.
[00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:28.529]  Incidentally enough, the measles outbreak in Disney was traced back to a vaccinated individual.
[00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:36.974]  So there we have vaccinated individuals getting the disease and then shedding it out through their own natural processes, getting other people sick.
[00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:38.415]  We've seen this happen in
[00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:39.336]  Other areas.
[00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:43.420]  China has a 99% vaccination rate, yet they can't get rid of the measles and whooping cough.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.104]  Maybe that's because they are spreading the measles and whooping cough with these vaccinations.
[00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:58.053]  Nobody knows for sure because the proper tests have not been done on this because you can't get the vaccination companies, Big Pharma, to do any kind of testing in this regard, other than saying the vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:02.177]  So, reporting from the Texas State Capitol, this is Rob Due for InfoWars Nightly News and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:10.905]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding and making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:13.246]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:05:13.407 --> 00:05:16.029]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.212]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:23.675]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:30.961]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:35.265]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.106]  We are the true media.
[00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:39.869]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.612]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
