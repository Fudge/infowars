[00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.029]  Jakari Jackson here.
[00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.150]  Now you guys know earlier this year we were talking a lot about pro-gun legislation.
[00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:19.632]  There are always going to be people who repackage things and try to come after your rights in a different way.
[00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.192]  And case in point is this.
[00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:26.834]  New Obama policy would make merely posting firearm information on the internet a crime.
[00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:28.894]  Which is completely ridiculous to me.
[00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:34.896]  Individuals would be in violation by merely posting information on the internet about common firearms.
[00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:35.876]  We're good to go.
[00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.187]  Grenades airdropped, you know Western governments.
[00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:13.459]  I don't know why they're so concerned about what people like Cody Wilson are doing But it's not just the printable guns whether it's the green tip ammunition that we saw earlier this year the ATF said yes We want to reclassify the green tip ammunition a lot of gun owners like yeah now Do I think that's the end of it?
[00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:21.325]  Absolutely not also the sanctions on the ak-47 and then we saw a run on the gun stores where you know, it's difficult to
[00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:29.887]  for time to get AK-47s and let us not forget the ban or the restrictions on magazine sizes.
[00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:44.029]  We don't want you to have more than 10 rounds in your magazine or 5 rounds in your magazines or whatever it was state-to-state gun manufacturers, magazine manufacturers actually moving to different states so they could produce without having all these restrictions on them.
[00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.030]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:01:56.514 --> 00:02:01.257]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:06.840]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:12.884]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:18.628]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:29.151]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:37.413]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:43.836]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:49.139]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.981]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
