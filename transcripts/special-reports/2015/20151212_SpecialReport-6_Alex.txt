[00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:22.379]  Well, as if things couldn't get any crazier on campuses across the nation, the protests going on at Mizzou have now segregated themselves by race.
[00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.560]  Supporters of the group Concerned Students 1950 assembled at the Student Center after a planned march got rained out.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.661]  Then, according to an activist who was on scene, whites were asked to leave.
[00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:41.663]  The crowd was divided up into seven groups for blacks or at least non-whites, and then the white people were told
[00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:42.384]  I think so.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.040]  We're good to go.
[00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:31.875]  Now, here we have people who think they're actually fighting the establishment, when in reality, you are the establishment.
[00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:36.417]  They will call for you to be fired for challenging their subjective feelings.
[00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:43.540]  They will literally call for police to arrest you, even if you are a journalist just trying to document their protests.
[00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:52.134]  Campus police sent out an email to students telling them to report any hurtful speech.
[00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:57.637]  Even though, as this email points out, hateful or hurtful speech is not a crime.
[00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.359]  So they're not actually going to do any arresting of anybody.
[00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.401]  They're just going to be policing thought and chilling free speech on campus.
[00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.022]  George Orwell would be so proud.
[00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:11.325]  So progressives, they champion diversity, but not diversity of thought.
[00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.007]  But where have we seen such student tactics before?
[00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:24.695]  Now, the Red Guards were a mass paramilitary social movement that started out as campus thought police attacking anyone that didn't hold the correct views.
[00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:30.059]  Chairman Mao is a favorite of campus crazies everywhere who think they're fighting the establishment.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.943]  He is also the world's most politically correct mass murderer.
[00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.925]  Mao was a rabid believer in political correctness.
[00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:38.847]  In fact, he wrote the book.
[00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:43.471]  Not to have a correct political point of view is like having no soul.
[00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:51.253]  Those are the words of the Chinese Communist leader who has the extreme distinction of having caused more deaths than any human in history.
[00:02:51.273 --> 00:02:53.133]  50 to 70 million.
[00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.694]  That's more than Stalin and Hitler combined.
[00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:57.474]  Let's simplify this a little bit.
[00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.795]  Humans and ants have a lot in common.
[00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:07.797]  They're both very loyal, they have hard work ethic, and they also have a strong sense of community that allows them to build really complex societies.
[00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:13.020]  Humans and ants also have enemies that seek to destroy their way of life.
[00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:18.584]  The Ectomon wasp is a particularly dangerous foe for the type of warfare that it uses.
[00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:23.768]  Upon entering the colony, the ants will immediately attack it in order to protect their queen.
[00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:29.391]  But the wasp emits a pheromone that causes the ants to start attacking each other.
[00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:37.197]  With the ants fighting amongst themselves, the wasp moves further along, laying its parasitic egg which will destroy the colony.
[00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.098]  And the ants are totally hopeless to defend against it.
[00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.120]  So ask yourself, are you fighting the real enemy?
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:56.027]  Or have you been soaked in socialist lefty lunacy, which seeks to destroy not only institutions of higher learning, but the entire colony, by attacking the very principles this country was founded upon?
[00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:57.868]  A new world order.
[00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.532]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:21.166]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.
[00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:23.467]  We know we're under attack!
[00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:24.727]  Look at that one!
[00:04:25.507 --> 00:04:26.068]  We're tracking it!
