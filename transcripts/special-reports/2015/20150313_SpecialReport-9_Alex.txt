[00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.364]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:13.987]  Now today I'm going to talk about an article that I saw on Drudge Report by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:20.231]  And this article is titled, Man Who Stabbed Pittsburgh K-9 Officer Rocco Will Receive a Lengthy Time in Jail.
[00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:28.616]  Now this guy, his name is John Rush, he killed the police officer Dog and will spend up to seven years in prison because of this.
[00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:31.678]  Now, the officer says, I lost my partner from this.
[00:00:31.738 --> 00:00:33.940]  I mean, he was also a family member to me.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.463]  Wow, that's crazy.
[00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.349]  Hands across America, man.
[00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.300]  You know, I don't feel good when any kind of animal is killed like that, but...
[00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:48.625]  I don't see the outcry from you guys when you come in on our property and shoot our dogs, but we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:56.949]  Rush, a convicted sex offender, was being sought on a bench warrant for his arrest when an officer deputy spotted him in Pittsburgh on January 28, 2014.
[00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.051]  Rush fought with the deputy, tried to disarm him, and then hid in the basement of an apartment building.
[00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:07.193]  Pittsburgh officers responded that if he didn't come out, that they would send the dog.
[00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:09.434]  They sent the dog, and Rush stabbed him.
[00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:14.697]  This is definitely a long sentence, said a university law professor, Wes Oliver.
[00:01:14.997 --> 00:01:18.579]  This is a sentence that could be handed down for a third degree murder charge.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.045]  Now, following Rocco's death, there was an outpouring of support for canine officers, which led to the passage of new legislation that took effect in August.
[00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:38.931]  It increased the grading of killing a police animal to a second degree felony, and from a third degree, and increased the penalty from up to seven years to ten years in prison.
[00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:43.245]  Although it didn't impact the sentence in this case, I'm hoping it will act as a deterrent.
[00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:49.907]  The K-9 officers are an integral part of law enforcement and significant investments in communities protecting their interests.
[00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:50.887]  Well, guess what?
[00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.428]  My dog is my family member as well.
[00:01:54.368 --> 00:02:04.211]  And I don't know how many times I have to come into work and I have to turn on my computer and read articles about thugs with badges who think they're above the law going in on someone's property and murdering a dog.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.521]  Shooting a dog in front of a little child.
[00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:15.788]  For crying out loud, a police officer showed up to a person's home, tried to shoot the dog, missed, and killed the mother in front of her family!
[00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.050]  But where's the outcry for that?
[00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.193]  Where is the parade for that?
[00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:24.475]  Now this dog, Rocco, received a huge parade.
[00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:31.261]  Brought all the canine dogs out, police officers, people in the community came out and waved American flags in support of Rocco the dog.
[00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:43.591]  But the tons and tons of animals across the country who get murdered by police officers because they're cowards, because they're punks, because they come in like thugs with these no-knock raves, there's no outcry about that.
[00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:47.602]  This is a serious, serious problem across America.
[00:02:47.923 --> 00:02:53.617]  And I just want to say that anyone who tries to come over and kill my dog, you've got a lot more to deal with because I will tear you up.
[00:02:55.987 --> 00:02:57.768]  These are family members.
[00:02:57.788 --> 00:02:59.949]  These are something that people love and care about.
[00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.631]  And you guys go out there and kill dogs and nothing happens.
[00:03:05.092 --> 00:03:09.374]  But this guy killed a police officer dog and all of a sudden everyone's broken hearted.
[00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:10.654]  All of a sudden people are up in arms.
[00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:12.655]  A police officer chokes a man to death.
[00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:15.417]  No one, it's like, uh, whatever.
[00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.277]  We'll let him go.
[00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:17.178]  Slap on the wrist.
[00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:19.679]  This is out of control.
[00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.960]  Police brutality is insane.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.961]  And there's something we've got to do about it.
[00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:26.145]  This needs to stop.
[00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:29.498]  Continue looking for more reports at InfoWars.com.
