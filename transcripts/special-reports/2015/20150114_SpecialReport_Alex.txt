[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.567]  Hey, Rob Dew with Infowars.com and I want to put out this quick report on the train fire or smoking that was happening last night in DC.
[00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:19.348]  Here's some of the headlines on the Dredge Report.
[00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:31.998]  There's a Washington Post article, One Dead After Smoke Fills Metro Train Station, Forcing Evacuation.
[00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.721]  And it talks about these two Voice of America employees, which is interesting.
[00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.344]  That's a propaganda outfit of the United States government.
[00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:43.567]  These two Voice of America employees got on the yellow train heading toward the Pentagon about 3 p.m.
[00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.350]  The six-car train had gone about 200 feet when it stopped.
[00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.172]  The train operator said, there's a problem, nobody move.
[00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:52.194]  The men said the car quickly began to fill with smoke.
[00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:55.896]  Now that's where it gets just totally effed up.
[00:00:56.477 --> 00:01:01.244]  Why would you sit on a train for 30 or 40 minutes while it's filling up with smoke?
[00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:04.990]  When you're only, these guys said it was 200 feet from the platform.
[00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.532]  Obviously not that very far.
[00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:07.974]  Other reports said that
[00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:13.859]  Train Metro employees actually got on the train and told everybody to get down low and not move.
[00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:15.400]  Why would you do that?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.105]  If you have smoke coming in, you have to get away from what's causing the smoke, which is obviously where you're going because that's where the train stopped.
[00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:24.886]  It stopped as it got to the smoke.
[00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:27.269]  Well, the NTSB did an investigation.
[00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:30.231]  They're actually 800 feet from the platform.
[00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:33.573]  Still, how long does it take you to walk 800 feet?
[00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:37.576]  Do you really have to sit there and wait for the firefighters to come evacuate you?
[00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.158]  Well, for one lady, that was too late.
[00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:41.158]  She died.
[00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:44.040]  She died from the smoke inhalation, and that's what kills more people in a fire.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.541]  It's not the heat from the flames.
[00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.662]  It's not the flames themselves.
[00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:47.963]  It's inhaling the smoke.
[00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:54.368]  Do you wait 30 or 40 minutes inside a burning house to evacuate?
[00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:57.191]  Do you wait for the firefighters to come and say, hey, it's okay to evacuate?
[00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:58.472]  No.
[00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.813]  But you're in DC.
[00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:01.934]  These people are probably used to being told what to do.
[00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:03.776]  They're probably government workers, most of them.
[00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:07.939]  So they're used to not lifting a finger unless somebody else tells them to do it.
[00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.982]  Which is really sad that this had to happen this way.
[00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.063]  You had a few people injured, some smoke inhalations.
[00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:13.984]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:20.683]  Now, after reading this, I'm like, could this have been some weird drill they were running to just see if they could keep people on the train?
[00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:26.307]  And then I started looking up about this, and lo and behold, here out of
[00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:32.116]  Daily News, NYPD subway gas attack attest on Monday, and this was from 2013.
[00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:46.204]  They were using a harmless, odorous, non-toxic gas that they used in the Manhattan Project, and we're going to trace it going through the subway system to see how it reacted, how it moved to test for a biological attack.
[00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:49.226]  But that's not the first time it was ever tested.
[00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:50.647]  Here's another one from the New York Times.
[00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:54.410]  Test gas attack is coming to subway this time with fair notice.
[00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.293]  So it talks about the test that I was just talking about, but then you go down to the bottom of the page.
[00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:10.082]  A team of Army researchers from a unit that specialized in biological and chemical warfare came to New York in June 1966 and secretly dropped light bulbs loaded with what they regarded as harmless bacteria
[00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:13.957]  On to the tracks of stations along the Avenue of the Americas.
[00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:21.622]  Another technique was to drop light bulbs on the sidewalk ventilation grates and let the cloud of bacteria drift down below in a kind of mist.
[00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:23.944]  People waiting for the trains got doused with the stuff.
[00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:30.688]  And there's a quote from a book when the Clouds and Gulf people, they brushed their clothing, looked up at the grating, and walked on.
[00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.771]  Other scientists brought meters and satchels and handbags to measure how quickly the stuff spread.
[00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.234]  Concerned they might have to explain what they were doing, they brought fake letters of identification
[00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:42.857]  Nosey bystanders were given icy glares and backed off.
[00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:47.280]  Although the bacteria was generally believed to be harmless, there are reports that people were sickened by them.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.206]  But it was years before anybody had realized that the Army had carried out this and other experiments and they were done by a special unit at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:03:54.806 --> 00:04:01.051]  People who came up with, it was the anthrax, the militarized anthrax, that's where they said it came from.
[00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:12.302]  I'm working with the Central Intelligence Agency and it didn't come to light until 1975 when they had those congressional hearings on the CIA with the heart attack gun and other such things.
[00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:15.033]  So was this a test?
[00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:15.673]  Probably not.
[00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.093]  It was probably some malfunction.
[00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:23.736]  But what I don't get is why the passengers stayed on the trains for 40 minutes before firefighters came to get them out.
[00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:30.518]  Obviously other Metro employees got on the train so it was safe to get off the train and walk because Metro employees were doing it.
[00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.459]  Oh, if you need a flashlight, how many people have cell phone flashlights?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.701]  Just about everybody there has a cell phone so they're able to illuminate their way out.
[00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.742]  You mean to tell me that you can't walk 800 feet
[00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:43.708]  While there's smoke pouring into your train?
[00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:47.270]  That's just so odd that people stayed on that train.
[00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.352]  So maybe it was the government just testing to see whether people...
[00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.812]  How they would react in these situations.
[00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:54.673]  Would they listen to the voice of authority?
[00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:57.094]  The guy that got on the loudspeaker and told everybody to be calm.
[00:04:57.474 --> 00:05:02.397]  It also reminds me of a time when Aaron Dykes and I were coming back from the airport from a trip.
[00:05:02.797 --> 00:05:06.019]  And we're walking along and all of a sudden the TSA guy yells, Freeze!
[00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.461]  He just tells everybody to freeze where they're at walking around inside the airport.
[00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:16.045]  We were already past the security area but they wanted us to freeze because they had some situation going on or what they claimed was a situation.
[00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:20.286]  So it's just another example of should we even listen to these authorities?
[00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:23.307]  These people who have proven themselves to be incompetent over and over again.
[00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:33.350]  Next time you're on a train and it starts filling up with smoke, I think you ought to think twice about listening to the voices of authority who tell you to stay on the train and not get out and get to safety.

[00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:09.272]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:16.236]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:18.517]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
