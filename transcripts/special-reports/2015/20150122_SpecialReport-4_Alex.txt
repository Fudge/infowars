[00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:12.029]  This is Rob Doo for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:18.450]  Today's report focuses on the EPA and specifically how the EPA wants to control aspects of your life.
[00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.751]  More specific than that, how they want to get rid of fires.
[00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:30.033]  That's right, the tool that we've been using for over 10,000 years to keep us warm, to cook our food, to heat our homes, they want to get rid of it.
[00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:33.655]  Even more specific than that, how they want to kill your grandmother.
[00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:34.315]  That's right.
[00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:38.380]  But before we get into those articles, I want to get into some climate change news.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.040]  That's right.
[00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.064]  Some global warming is happening all over the United States right now.
[00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.146]  Especially if you go outside, you can feel it everywhere.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.663]  Winter blast delays schools, closes ski resorts, moves east.
[00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:58.353]  The coldest blast of Arctic air so far this winter is moving east across the country, delaying school openings, triggering frostbite concerns, and even forcing a Minnesota ski resort to close early over the weekend.
[00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:06.520]  Across most of the country, they're expecting temperatures to be 10 to 35 degrees below normal, with wind chills of minus 25, even up to minus 45 degrees in northern Ohio.
[00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:12.326]  2014 Chicago has been the coldest in years.
[00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.528]  That's out of CBS Local.
[00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:17.232]  The last time the average annual year-to-date temperature was this cold was back in 1904.
[00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:20.055]  NOAA winner 2013-14 among the coldest on record in Midwest.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.162]  And what do all these global warming record cold temperatures mean?
[00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:27.424]  Well, it means a lot of people are going to die.
[00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:30.568]  It's not the cold, not global warming that we should be worried about.
[00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:49.228]  No one seems to be upset that in modern Britain old people are freezing to death as hidden taxes make fuel more expensive.
[00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:57.573]  The government's chief scientific officer, Sir David King, later declared that climate change was more serious than the threat of terrorism in terms of the number of lives that can be lost.
[00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:04.398]  Since Sir David's exonerations, some 250,000 Brits have died from the cold and 10,000 from the heat.
[00:02:04.638 --> 00:02:06.139]  So there you have it.
[00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:13.084]  Since 2003, hundreds of thousands of people, mostly elderly, have died in Britain due to the cold than from the heat.
[00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:14.904]  We are the independent.
[00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:20.766]  Bitter conditions linked to deaths of additional 31,000 people last winter, a rise of almost one-third.
[00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:31.749]  Pensioners were worse affected by the 31,000 additional deaths, which were calculated by comparing the death rates among non-winter months to those that occur between December and March, the ONS report states.
[00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.270]  Elderly person dies every seven minutes due to fuel poverty scandal.
[00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.014]  And this UK Express article talks about how nearly 3.5 million people will not be able to pay their heating bill this winter.
[00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:44.335]  Back to the U.S.
[00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:45.496]  Killer cold.
[00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:47.957]  Winter is deadlier than summer in U.S.
[00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:51.800]  Winter cold kills twice as many Americans as does summer heat.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.141]  About 2,000 U.S.
[00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:56.684]  residents die each year from weather-related causes of death.
[00:02:57.064 --> 00:03:00.967]  One interesting finding was the high number of deaths in rural West due to the cold.
[00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:01.947]  New York Times.
[00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:05.510]  Even before long winter begins, energy bills send shivers in England.
[00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.993]  It talks about a guy named John York, who in October paid about $375 for his heating bill.
[00:03:12.373 --> 00:03:16.255]  In November, his bill jumped to $788, a staggering increase of 110%.
[00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:22.619]  Ozarkfirst.com reports, heating bills on the rise for many as temperatures drop.
[00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.119]  So what do those articles show?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.603]  One, that the northern hemisphere is getting cooler, not warmer, as many have predicted, especially all those climate change Nazis out there.
[00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:34.885]  And two, this really affects old people.
[00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:38.518]  So now I'm going to show you how the EPA is trying to kill your grandmother.
[00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:41.500]  What do most people use in the West and in the North?
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.201]  They use wood-burning stoves.
[00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.762]  Wood's a great source of heat.
[00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:46.022]  It's abundant.
[00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:46.923]  It's everywhere.
[00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:51.286]  People can get it themselves, and they don't have to rely on an infrastructure to deliver it to them.
[00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:55.188]  Plus, they don't get those utility bills related that other people get.
[00:03:55.388 --> 00:03:56.389]  They're not getting the gas.
[00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.930]  They're not getting the electrical increases.
[00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.712]  They're just burning wood that can be found anywhere.
[00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.612]  Well, that is, of course, unless you live in Oregon.
[00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:08.754]  Air regulators ban visible chimney smoke from wood stoves in Eugene area.
[00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:18.380]  Wood stove owners in the Eugene-Springfield area have been pouring on the fuel during the cold snap, and air quality regulators say a buildup in pollution means that the burning has to be curbed.
[00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:25.602]  The Eugene Register Guard reports that such bans may become more frequent because federal standards on particulate pollution have been tightened.
[00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:29.025]  Agency bans wood burning stove in three cities.
[00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:40.195]  Tighter particulate pollution standards set by the federal government in 2006 have required communities nationwide to clamp down on wood stove burning and other sources of smoke carrying small particulate matter.
[00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:46.091]  And this brochure is put out by LRAPA, the Lane County Regional Air Protection Agency.
[00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:49.034]  It says, burning wood can be an economical way to heat your home.
[00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:52.577]  However, burning wood improperly wastes fuel and causes harmful air pollution.
[00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:56.440]  And it shows some pictures of what is proper smoke and what is not proper smoke.
[00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:57.561]  And it talks about the
[00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:04.888]  Terror threat levels they have for smoke pollution, green, yellow, red one, and red two, and what they mean to you.
[00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:13.395]  And they can actually fine you between $50 and $500 for each infraction of visible smoke coming out of your chimney when they put out these burn bans.
[00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:15.997]  Citations issued for violating wood stove ban.
[00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:23.684]  Eugene, Oregon, for the first time in five years, the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency will issue citations to some Eugene residents for violating a burn ban.
[00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:30.289]  El Rapa receives call from neighbors during the burn ban who said they saw those living around them in violation of the burn ban.
[00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.072]  The agency then goes out and inspects the report for themselves.
[00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:46.202]  So they've got their tattletale squad set up, they have a hotline you can call, and then they send out an agent to actually look at the smoke coming from your chimney to see if it violates, according to this chart, one of their burn ban violation rules.
[00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:48.484]  And this doesn't just happen in Oregon.
[00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:51.746]  It's happening all over the country and it's due to the EPA.
[00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:53.407]  Here's some more areas where it's happening.
[00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:56.169]  Fireplace use banned in several California counties.
[00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.072]  Air District officials have issued a ban on fireplaces in seven California counties.
[00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:02.392]  No smoking.
[00:06:02.452 --> 00:06:04.454]  New York City bans fireplace construction.
[00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:12.317]  On July 1st, no wood-burning fireplaces can be built in New York City residences, in a measure announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Earth Day.
[00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:22.081]  And this burn ban would even cover the mayor's residence where the original Yuletide log was filmed, although we know government officials never have to abide by the rules that they set upon the rest of us.
[00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:23.682]  Now let's go to Washington State.
[00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:28.230]  Wood stove and fireplace restrictions announced due to air quality concerns.
[00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.052]  Indoor burn ban effective immediately.
[00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:37.778]  Strict standards were implemented in 1988 by the United States EPA and were further enforced by the state of Washington in 1995.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.842]  So we're seeing a record here of western states
[00:06:42.162 --> 00:06:55.831]  Very liberal-minded states are taking these environmental regulations set up by the EPA and then creating bodies and boards and agencies and inspectors to go out there and look at people's chimneys, look and see what they're burning, and impose fines on them.
[00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:57.572]  But why are they going after wood?
[00:06:57.692 --> 00:06:58.713]  What is the big deal?
[00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:00.474]  Well, I'm about to tell you.
[00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:00.974]  Here it is.
[00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:06.758]  From Forbes, EPA's wood-burning stove ban has chilling consequences for many rural people.
[00:07:07.578 --> 00:07:10.659]  It seems that wood isn't green or renewable enough anymore.
[00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:22.142]  The EPA has recently banned the production and sale of 80% of America's current wood-burning stoves, the oldest heating method known to mankind, and a mainstay for rural homes in many of our nation's poorest residents.
[00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:29.784]  That's right, it's going after the rural, poor, and old people, because a lot of people that are older live in the rural communities.
[00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:30.764]  According to the U.S.
[00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.845]  Census Bureau's 2011 survey,
[00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:37.728]  2.4 million household units burn wood as their primary heating source.
[00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:38.549]  That's right.
[00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.692]  These left people really want to go after stuff that they claim isn't green.
[00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:45.174]  Even burning trees is a renewable resource.
[00:07:45.434 --> 00:07:48.096]  That's not a green form of technology that they want.
[00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.738]  They want this really expensive technology.
[00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:56.583]  They want people to go out and buy new wood stoves, upgrade their stoves, get rid of the old ones, make them inoperable.
[00:07:56.903 --> 00:08:00.946]  And all this is a way to control what humans use and how they use it.
[00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:03.648]  Because they just can't stand free individuals.
[00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:04.528]  So that's what they have to do.
[00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:05.429]  They have to attack them.
[00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:29.304]  Yeah.
[00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:38.707]  Heating your home used to be as simple as starting a fire with some paper and some kindling and some wood.
[00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:41.408]  Now you have to bend over backwards to these regulations.
[00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:44.429]  You have to look at the soot and smoke that's coming out of your smokestack.
[00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:49.311]  And if you don't, your neighbor might turn you in and then you're going to get fined by these agencies out there.
[00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:53.874]  It's just another form of hidden tax and it's meant to drive people off their land and I'll get into that.
[00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.656]  But let's look at the EPA and what they do.
[00:08:56.716 --> 00:09:02.639]  Let's look at some of their activities and see if those are sustainable or proper or even civil.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.483]  EPA tested deadly pollutants on humans to push Obama administration's agenda and this is from the Daily Caller.
[00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:16.889]  The Environmental Protection Agency has been conducting dangerous experiments on humans over the past few years in order to justify onerous clean air regulations.
[00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:29.292]  Basically, what they were doing was setting up a room, starting up a truck outside, running a pipe from the tailpipe into this enclosed area and actually sticking a hose in people's mouths and made them breathe exhaust to check and see if it was dangerous.
[00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:32.592]  I can tell you without the experiment that it's dangerous to do that to people.
[00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:37.433]  But the EPA did it, but it must be okay because they're doing it for a greener planet.
[00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:38.454]  Here's more.
[00:09:39.194 --> 00:09:43.635]  Don Salazar, EPA sued over illegal experimentation on human subjects.
[00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:55.669]  The EPA and its administrator Lisa Jackson in her official capacity are targeted in the lawsuit for knowingly conducting experiments on humans that involved exposing those persons to toxic substances that the agency believes will cause death.
[00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.734]  But it's not even the elderly and infirm that they were testing these diesel fumes on.
[00:10:00.035 --> 00:10:02.778]  They were also testing them on 10-year-old children.
[00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.479]  But this is all allowed.
[00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:11.942]  Back in 2005, the San Francisco Gate reported that the EPA has loopholes that allow them to test on children that have been abused and neglected.
[00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:16.964]  These are our most vulnerable citizens that the EPA is conducting illegal experiments on.
[00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:19.405]  And what are all these EPA regulations supposed to do?
[00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:21.846]  Well, they're supposed to get people out of the rural areas.
[00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:31.250]  Where you could have wood-burning stoves and alternative heating sources that aren't from the main utility companies and pushing people into the cities.
[00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.490]  Here it is from The Atlantic.
[00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.032]  More Americans moving to cities reversing the suburban exodus.
[00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:40.353]  2013 saw 2.3 million more people living in metro areas than 2012.
[00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:50.700]  The trend in city living is driven primarily by two groups, young professionals and baby boomers who are retiring and moving back to the cities they left when they started families.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:11:05.510]  So there they are, they're pushing the old people out, and if they don't kill them first with all these regulations and high heating bills, well, they're going to herd them into these compact cities where then they can maintain total control over them and have control over everything in their house, all the heating, all the appliances.
[00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.834]  It's all part of this new wave of control that the government's slowly ratcheting up, slowly inching up to take over your life.
[00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:14.497]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:17.801]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp.
[00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:21.165]  the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:23.568]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[00:11:24.148 --> 00:11:26.331]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:30.556]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega-computer in charge.
[00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:34.178]  UN-backed scientists call for mega-city population lock-up.
[00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.760]  This is put out by Planet Under Pressure.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.422]  It has statements here from some of the scientists.
[00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:40.002]  Check this out.
[00:11:40.363 --> 00:11:42.985]  We certainly don't want people strolling about the countryside.
[00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:45.887]  We want to save the land for nature by living closely together.
[00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:53.332]  Insisting the world population be locked up within the compounds of mega-cities, the elites realize that if the herd is to be properly controlled, walls are needed.
[00:11:53.472 --> 00:11:53.972]  Thick walls.
[00:11:54.012 --> 00:11:58.476]  And by constructing these walls and making the masses go inside of them, it will be easier to control.
[00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:06.942]  Chief Scientist Mikel Fragas, involved with Planet Under Pressure, told MSNBC, the answer to population growth is denser cities.
[00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:11.205]  Now let's look at this 2012 Planet Under Pressure press release.
[00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:17.690]  A fast-growing number of high-tech, artificially intelligent, internet-connected cars, appliances, cameras, roadways and pipelines and more.
[00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.893]  That's what they want to push everybody towards, this total control infrastructure.
[00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:24.308]  And how will they improve efficiency?
[00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:33.737]  Using utility meters and sensors that monitor the capacity of power generation, network, and continually gather data and supply on demand of electricity.
[00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:34.898]  Those are your smart meters.
[00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:40.223]  Integrated travel and information services and toll road pricing based on traffic, weather, and other data.
[00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:44.768]  Those are the black boxes in the cars and the TSA controlling who travels where.
[00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:48.794]  Data gathering and feedback from citizens using mobile phones.
[00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:51.057]  That's the NSA spying they're doing on you.
[00:12:51.397 --> 00:12:55.521]  So all this is under this Planet Under Pressure plan back in 2012.
[00:12:57.263 --> 00:12:58.705]  And where does all this come from?
[00:12:58.805 --> 00:13:01.748]  All this EPA regulations that have recently come about?
[00:13:01.788 --> 00:13:03.150]  Well, it all comes from the UN.
[00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:07.283]  Wood fires fuel climate change UN.
[00:13:07.323 --> 00:13:08.343]  This is out of The Guardian.
[00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:16.989]  The United Nations report has just uncovered wood burning and diesel vehicles as two of the biggest culprits in the developing world of generating black carbon soot.
[00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:19.210]  That is a major cause of climate change.
[00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:28.416]  It's nice to sit in front of a wood fire in the winter, but we should all be feeling pretty guilty, says Joseph Alcamao, Chief Scientist at the UN Environment Program.
[00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:29.977]  Here's the telegraph.
[00:13:30.297 --> 00:13:32.299]  Wood-burning stoves cause global warming.
[00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:37.202]  300,000 tons of black carbon emissions in Europe and New York comes from wood-burning.
[00:13:37.523 --> 00:13:39.965]  Wood-burning stoves are gaining popularity in both the U.S.
[00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:47.090]  and Europe as homes go back to rustic fashion and the price of heating rises and households are encouraged to adopt a green technology.
[00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:53.175]  But it's got to be the right kind of green technology, not the kind that doesn't put you under environmental regulation.
[00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:56.436]  Now, how do the EPA and UN mix together?
[00:13:56.556 --> 00:14:01.278]  Well, here they are right here on the EPA's own website under their climate change section.
[00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:02.859]  International Climate Partnerships.
[00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:07.160]  Below is a list of main international climate change initiatives the EPA supports.
[00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:12.102]  And it lists the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as one of their international conventions.
[00:14:12.362 --> 00:14:14.843]  It also lists ENERGY STAR as one of the programs it supports.
[00:14:14.863 --> 00:14:18.325]  And that's the program where they take all the appliances out there,
[00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:25.367]  Basically make them work with less electricity using less water, but they don't also work as well as they used to.
[00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:28.508]  That's all part of the new global love that they're going to be pushing on you.
[00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:39.152]  We're good to go.
[00:14:55.584 --> 00:14:58.686]  That was signed by an EPA Administrator, Jackson.
[00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:07.132]  So the EPA is signing up with the UN to basically control you, get rid of wood-burning stoves, because those are bad, and push people into compact cities.
[00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.594]  That's going to kill your grandmother and kill wood-burning as we know it.
[00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:14.897]  And you've got to ask yourselves, we've been burning wood for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years.
[00:15:15.257 --> 00:15:16.818]  Do we really need to get rid of this act?
[00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:20.501]  Is this something that it's time to get rid of, that we shouldn't have wood-burning anymore?
[00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:23.603]  Is it really that big of a problem, or is there something else?
[00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:25.204]  Is there a bigger agenda afoot?
[00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:33.707]  Agenda 21 is the action plan to destroy your sovereignty, and that is your personal sovereignty and your national sovereignty.
[00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:42.650]  This is the green mask, the environmental mask, because if you are terrified that you're killing the planet, you will be willing to accept any restriction.
[00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:43.611]  That's right.
[00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:44.931]  It's Agenda 21.
[00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:47.352]  And this doesn't just pertain to the United States.
[00:15:47.492 --> 00:15:48.452]  This is going everywhere.
[00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:50.173]  Here it is in Business Insider.
[00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:52.654]  Cool Yule as Paris bans fire logs.
[00:15:53.614 --> 00:15:56.957]  435 towns and cities will be banned from using open fireplaces.
[00:15:57.137 --> 00:15:58.539]  So they're banning fires.
[00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:04.724]  Greek government to ban operation of fireplaces and wood-burning stoves and fine wrongdoers.
[00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:06.365]  It's like the evildoers.
[00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:12.911]  There's an army of counselors, advisors, experts and specialists sitting in their fuzzy warm offices in several Greek ministries.
[00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:18.555]  This army of well-paid spoiled slackers spend the winter months at work because taxpayers come up with their heating needs.
[00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:28.703]  This money is also paid to those taxpayers who freeze in their own icy cold homes because they cannot afford the exorbitant prices of heating oil, natural gas, and electricity needed for A.C.
[00:16:29.383 --> 00:16:37.710]  Can you imagine the fireplace police, or will they be called the wood police, as they enter your home and fine you a hundred euros and even detain you for heating your home?
[00:16:38.641 --> 00:16:41.923]  EU in bid to freeze out patio heaters and that's from the Guardian.
[00:16:42.484 --> 00:16:50.749]  And they say when this ban comes into effect and is enforced it will cost pubs and eateries in the UK up to 250 million pounds of lost revenue per year.
[00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.411]  That's the name of the game in Europe and the US everywhere.
[00:16:54.732 --> 00:17:00.516]  The UN's pushing it and now the United States has gone into it with the EPA and that's to ban this type of activity.
[00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:03.798]  They want to ban basic human activity that's been around for 10,000 years.
[00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:06.580]  But why is that?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.661]  It's because of carbon, they say.
[00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.202]  It's heating up the earth.
[00:17:10.282 --> 00:17:11.183]  It's cooling the earth.
[00:17:11.623 --> 00:17:12.624]  It's changing the earth.
[00:17:12.684 --> 00:17:13.044]  Whatever.
[00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:21.871]  And that this carbon dioxide, it's not even carbon, it's carbon dioxide, but they call it carbon because they don't want you to really think about what it is because you know in grade school you were taught, right?
[00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.312]  Photosynthesis?
[00:17:23.632 --> 00:17:25.794]  Plants breathe carbon dioxide, put out oxygen.
[00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:26.611]  Yeah.
[00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.492]  Well, now it's been proven.
[00:17:29.332 --> 00:17:29.813]  Daily Mail.
[00:17:30.173 --> 00:17:33.214]  Carbon dioxide emissions help tropical rainforests grow faster.
[00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:36.436]  Studies show trees absorb more greenhouse gas than expected.
[00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:41.398]  NASA study shows tropical rainforests absorb 1.5 billion tons of CO2 a year.
[00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:46.301]  Rainforests absorb more than half the CO2 taken up by vegetation globally.
[00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:52.481]  Tropical forests are growing faster than scientists thought due to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
[00:17:52.761 --> 00:17:58.683]  So you see, as carbon dioxide increases, plants grow faster, taking in that carbon dioxide and putting out more oxygen.
[00:17:58.983 --> 00:17:59.944]  That's how it works.
[00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:01.724]  It's a self-regulating mechanism.
[00:18:02.244 --> 00:18:06.846]  But not if you talk to a UN Global Climate Change person.
[00:18:07.146 --> 00:18:10.627]  They just are like, carbon, carbon, carbon, we gotta get rid of the carbon, gotta get rid of the carbon.
[00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:14.269]  NASA, how tropical rainforests may end the climate change issue.
[00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.230]  But what about all that polar sea ice that they're telling you about?
[00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.871]  It's melting, it's melting away.
[00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:22.373]  Well, number of ships transitioning Arctic waters falls in 2004.
[00:18:22.513 --> 00:18:24.354]  This is out of ABC News.
[00:18:24.774 --> 00:18:34.439]  Mike Humford, Executive Director of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based think tank, says, I think 2014 shows that development and Arctic shipping may be further off than we might have thought a few years ago.
[00:18:34.499 --> 00:18:37.041]  The ice is not melting as quickly as previously predicted.
[00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:41.303]  Arctic sea ice a whole lot more stable than scientist Al Gore predicted.
[00:18:41.584 --> 00:18:47.487]  Despite dire predictions that the North Pole will be ice-free in the near future, Arctic ice levels have been more stable than scientists predicted.
[00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:48.568]  So what does all this mean?
[00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:52.836]  These global governments are getting together with local regions.
[00:18:52.856 --> 00:18:54.696]  They're not even cities or states or counties.
[00:18:54.776 --> 00:18:56.117]  It's these regional areas.
[00:18:56.437 --> 00:18:59.198]  And they're maintaining control over basic human activity.
[00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:04.621]  And once they ban fire, and once they kill off your grandmother and take her land, what are they coming after next?
[00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:05.762]  They're coming after the wheel.
[00:19:06.122 --> 00:19:08.863]  And that wheel is those drivers out there, in their cars.
[00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:15.346]  They're going to force you into driverless cars, into compact cities, and control everything you do, all in the name of saving the planet.
[00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:17.288]  Remember this next time you start a fire.
[00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:24.494]  In fact, maybe you should start a fire right now just to protest the UN and the EPA and all these global climate change fanatics.
[00:19:24.874 --> 00:19:27.536]  This has been Rob Doo for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:56.966]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.248]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:19:59.428 --> 00:20:04.632]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:09.877]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:20:10.017 --> 00:20:13.119]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:17.321]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:21.843]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:32.028]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
