[00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:27.346]  A border patrol agent has testified that the Department of Homeland Security is deliberately fudging data to hoodwink the American public into believing that the border is secure, when in reality it is overrun, with 60% of all illegal crossers going uncaptured.
[00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:31.869]  Out there in our areas of operation, we leave large swaths of land uncovered.
[00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.771]  Maybe 20, 30 miles at times.
[00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:40.976]  I've been told by our chief of our sector that we are going to bleed heavily on our flanks at all of our stations.
[00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:45.059]  The western flank usually gets neglected because we don't have enough manpower to get out there.
[00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:53.145]  Our agents will count the foot sign, they will call it in, and at the end of the day, the numbers get manipulated so that it doesn't show up correctly.
[00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:59.754]  One time I asked the sheriff, I said, can we go sit down on the border all night long with your scope truck and see what we see?
[00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:03.158]  In six hours, we saw one Border Patrol agent.
[00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:09.427]  You know, if I had to estimate, I could not prove this, but I would estimate that 50% of people coming across that ranch at least are not apprehended.
[00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:14.008]  My great-grandmother and my grandmother grew up right alongside the river.
[00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:26.592]  And what my grandmother would tell me was when she was young, people would come up and they would give them food and they would feed them, give them some water, let them sit in the shade for a little bit, and then they'd send them on their way.
[00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.493]  Now, the same people that live down there on that border, they say it's a different
[00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:32.374]  type of people that are coming.
[00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:34.256]  It's a different generation that's coming through.
[00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:42.163]  Now when they see people walking up the gravel road, they go inside, they shutter the windows, and they lock the doors, and they just don't want any part of it.
[00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:47.427]  Not because of some sense of country or whatever the case may be.
[00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:49.108]  It's a sense of personal safety.
[00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:55.514]  These ranchers and farmers and the citizens that live in these vulnerable areas are afraid to leave their homes.
[00:01:56.454 --> 00:02:00.135]  For the fact they'd be breaking into Scott Arena, for example, I'll speak on his behalf.
[00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.335]  He's been broken in four or five times.
[00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.396]  One time, holding the door closed while they're trying to break in.
[00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:07.296]  Growing up in the valley, we spent a great deal of time on the river.
[00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.257]  You go down, you ski, you swim, you picnic, you camp out.
[00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:14.498]  People had camp cabins, people had trailers down there that they kept.
[00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.899]  It was a very relaxed atmosphere.
[00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.799]  If you go down the river right now, you will see it's all gone.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.180]  It is all gone.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.540]  No one does any of that anymore.
[00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:24.906]  No one.
[00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:26.451]  And there's a reason.
[00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.875]  It's not the immigrants.
[00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:29.259]  It's the cartel.
[00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:36.859]  We're not even prosecuting, for example, marijuana smugglers unless they have at least 500 pounds of marijuana.
[00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.940]  We just don't bother prosecuting.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.361]  And the jurisdictional battles is, I don't want to touch that prosecution.
[00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.222]  You take care of it.
[00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:44.703]  Teenagers are an example.
[00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:50.886]  I think we have four or five in our jail right now that are remanded juveniles that have been arrested, picked up.
[00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.947]  We actually remand them as adults and put them in our center to prosecute them.
[00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.088]  The federal government won't prosecute them.
[00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.929]  Again, so the drug traffickers use teenagers because?
[00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.130]  They won't prosecute.
[00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.371]  And I was talking to the Sheriff in Yuma, Sheriff Wilmot, last night.
[00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:14.656]  There's an issue right now where those illegals that have child or that pornography, child pornography, they won't prosecute.
[00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:22.498]  Some of our agents that get assaulted, if it doesn't meet the threshold, if he doesn't have enough blood or bruising, they don't prosecute.
[00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:23.719]  Some of these people that were coming
[00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:26.531]  They could have taken the breach.
[00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:39.751]  They could have come across through the port of entry, asked for amnesty or what's the word I'm looking for, credible fear, and it would have been granted, and they would have broken no laws.
[00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:43.392]  But the smugglers control who crosses where.
[00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:50.033]  If a group of immigrants are walking towards the bridge, the cartels will come up and say, look, you're not crossing that bridge.
[00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:51.093]  You're going to go through this river.
[00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:52.893]  No, well, I'd rather cross through the bridge.
[00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:53.733]  Well, you don't have a choice.
[00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:57.134]  You're going to cross through here at this point, at this time, when we tell you.
[00:03:57.194 --> 00:03:58.614]  And on top of that, you're going to pay us.
[00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:05.095]  And they send them across when they want to send them across, where they want to send them across, because they know it's going to tie up our resources.
[00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:08.576]  And in doing so, then they can do the end around and run some either
[00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:10.578]  We're good to go.
[00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:33.935]  Breitbart News has acquired in advance of Heritage Foundation Senior Research Fellow Robert Rector's upcoming testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
[00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:45.398]  He states that the lifetime costs of Social Security and Medicare benefits of illegal immigrant beneficiaries of President Obama's executive amnesty would be well over a trillion dollars.
[00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:53.642]  DAPA recipients would earn $7.8 billion annually due to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit.
[00:04:54.143 --> 00:05:07.010]  Retroactive costs of the EITC and the ACTC, with the IRS policy allowing illegals to claim up to three years of tax benefits for illegal work, could be an estimated $23.5 billion.
[00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:19.834]  Rector points out that the average DAPA-eligible family already receives around $6,600 per year in means-tested welfare benefits prior to Obama's executive action.
[00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:24.476]  That aggregate cost is around $13.4 billion per year.
[00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:35.519]  Rector argues that future legislation could eventually make DAPA-eligible families able to get coverage under Obamacare at a cost of $14 billion annually.
[00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:51.823]  Rector also states, on average, the combined cost of means-tested welfare benefits currently received, the EITC and the ACTC cash, and potential Obamacare benefits would come to $17,800 per year per DAPA family.
[00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:55.724]  The aggregate cost to the taxpayer would be over $35 billion per year.
[00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.332]  But I think it's time America gets alarmed.
[00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:02.835]  They've already come through here.
[00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:03.315]  It's us.
[00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.058]  It's the humanitarian crisis.
[00:06:05.418 --> 00:06:07.100]  And it's an OTM crisis.
[00:06:07.981 --> 00:06:10.564]  Just take out the factor of the women and children.
[00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:13.007]  It's an other-than-Mexican crisis right now.
[00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:14.990]  We're being invaded.
[00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:25.804]  By third world country people and in those third world country people are the special interest aliens and our borders are porous.
[00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:31.993]  They feel like they're wide open right now and that's a dangerous scenario.
[00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:57.839]  But I did discover, and I think this is laid out very clearly in the blog, that among the human trafficking going on in Belize is a large number of Lebanese males coming into the country with passports from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and are given brand new identities, brand new names, and using handlers, handled off ultimately into America with a very dangerous package.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.800]  Now that surprised me, that shocked me.
[00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:06.730]  Well, you know, the thing is, is that, you know, it's coming through down here, but it's not necessarily going to affect down here because we're not really a good target.
[00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.471]  You know, there's nothing down here worth blowing up.
[00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:17.373]  But you get up into, say, the Austin or the New York or the Boston or, you know, any major city, Dallas, and that's where the target is.
[00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:22.715]  So unfortunately, it's not going to, fortunately, unfortunately, I guess, it's not going to happen down here.
[00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:28.637]  We're just watching the parade go by and whatever happens is going to happen somewhere big where it's going to affect the rest of the world, not just us.
[00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:29.419]  Sweet!
[00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:43.865]  Yeah, well, and you know, I'm thankful to see you guys in the media because you guys are really putting the word out when the Border Patrol is really trying to stifle everything and you know, if people really knew what was going on down here, you know, they'd be held accountable.
[00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:58.665]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:01.247]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:11.256]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:19.778]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
