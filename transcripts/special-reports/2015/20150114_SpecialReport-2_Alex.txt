[00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.046]  Dan Badondi reporting for The InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:21.916]  On this podium right behind me, the state of Rhode Island is about to crown its first ever female governor, Gina Raimondo, who also happens to be the state's general treasurer.
[00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.681]  She has lost $372 million out of the pension fund.
[00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.385]  She's a member of the communist group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the CFR.
[00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:31.926]  She's also a gun grabber.
[00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:36.587]  She was backed by both Obamas and both Clintons and had endorsements from the Pope.
[00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:42.048]  So it's going to be pretty interesting to see what kind of charity unfolds in the state of Rhode Island within the next four years.
[00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:43.529]  Hi ma'am, how are you?
[00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:44.549]  I'm well, thank you.
[00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.969]  How are you?
[00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.969]  Great, and are you here to support Gina Raimondo?
[00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:47.869]  Yes, I am.
[00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.550]  Yes, I am.
[00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.250]  I am.
[00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.951]  She's a wonderful person and I think she's going to do a very, very good job.
[00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:54.991]  Absolutely.
[00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:57.271]  Okay, and do you support her gun control policy?
[00:00:58.632 --> 00:00:59.732]  The gun control policy?
[00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.172]  I'll have to pass on that one, you know what I mean?
[00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:06.513]  As far as that goes, you know, her policy on that.
[00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.095]  Well, you know, I'd have to really take a look at them.
[00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:11.796]  She's sterner with the gun control, which is a positive.
[00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:22.222]  I think that gun control really needs a fresh look at the amendment and how it affects society and how it's kind of a breach of our civil liberties to support it in the wrong way.
[00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:23.903]  I think it's good, yeah.
[00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.745]  We need to get more guns off the street, definitely.
[00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:28.466]  Do you know who the CFR is?
[00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:29.638]  I do not.
[00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:30.398]  No, I'm not.
[00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:31.119]  Nope, never heard of it.
[00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.179]  And like I said, I'm not really here for politics.
[00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:47.633]  I didn't know that.
[00:01:48.153 --> 00:01:49.073]  No, I didn't know that.
[00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.235]  But I, you know, I have no comment on it.
[00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:59.460]  I know her since she started running and I think she's on the right path and gonna do very good.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.921]  Am I aware that there are communist organizations?
[00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:02.862]  Well, of course there are.
[00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:05.623]  McCarthyism's a long time off from here, isn't it?
[00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:10.006]  You were also aware that about the $372 million missing out of the pension fund.
[00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:11.167]  What are your thoughts about that?
[00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:12.327]  Is that just a scandal?
[00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:17.308]  I think I want to end this.
[00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.049]  Alright, thank you.
[00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:19.829]  Yeah, no problem.
[00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.533]  Now, we're going to have to give up a little of our own narrow self-interest and give something back to our community.
[00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.275]  But that's how America works.
[00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.257]  Hey, Governor, could you tell us your involvement in the CFR, please?
[00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:38.419]  Mrs. Raimondo.
[00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.641]  Mrs. Raimondo, could you tell us your involvement in the CFR, please?
[00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.629]  Hi Governor, what's your involvement with the CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations?
[00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.690]  Hi, we're going to go down.
[00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:51.213]  Do you know it's a communist organization?
[00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:54.917]  Governor, what's your involvement with the Council on Foreign Relations?
[00:02:54.937 --> 00:02:55.618]  The public wants to know.
[00:02:55.698 --> 00:02:59.562]  We just want to answer them, that's all we want.
[00:03:03.206 --> 00:03:06.270]  So you support communism, right here in the state of Rhode Island?
[00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:10.004]  See, the governor refuses to answer the question.
[00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:16.366]  I got two Gestapo cops over here blocking my way with their classic one-on-one psychology skills here.
[00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:19.488]  You gentlemen familiar with who the CFR is?
[00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:22.409]  The Council on Foreign Relations, a communist organization.
[00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.409]  Started by David Rockefeller.
[00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.651]  Gina Raimondo is a registered member, sir.
[00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:33.053]  Gina Raimondo is campaign manager.
[00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:35.594]  Are you a member of the CFR like Gina?
[00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.691]  Mr. Hayes, how does it feel to support a communist?
[00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:46.132]  How does it feel to support a communist?
[00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:48.973]  Very good to see.
[00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:53.514]  No, I'm just asking questions.
[00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:55.675]  Why are you going to be answering questions?
[00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:55.995]  Huh?
[00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:56.775]  Who said?
[00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:57.335]  Huh?
[00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:57.775]  Hold on.
[00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.036]  Yeah, why don't you stay right here, okay?
[00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:10.658]  No, it's the First Amendment.
[00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:12.880]  I understand that, but you're just not in there.
[00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.342]  I have a right to be in there.
[00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:15.403]  No, you don't.
[00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:15.623]  Yeah, I do.
[00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:17.645]  It's called the First Amendment.
[00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.606]  It's the First Amendment of the Constitution.
[00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:23.950]  So the staff told you I can't go in there?
[00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.097]  According to this officer here, the staff of the governor said I can't go into the room.
[00:04:34.013 --> 00:04:36.014]  Sir, press is denied access.
[00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:41.775]  Sir, who's in charge?
[00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:47.897]  No, I mean, I know they told you to get your order from the other meeting there, but who's in charge?
[00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:52.078]  Because that's, that's a vio- I'm part of the press and it's a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:55.739]  Regardless of what Eric Heyer says, he's not the boss.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.360]  Who can I talk to?
[00:05:00.657 --> 00:05:01.558]  Who's in charge here?
[00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.544]  Sir, do you just get in line and go right through the receiving line like everybody else?
[00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:06.606]  No, I mean that... No problem, okay?
[00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:20.149]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.411]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.153]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:28.400]  Because of toxic food and our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.369]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.650]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.414]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:55.401]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy powder, the secret 12 bioavailable vitamin B12,
