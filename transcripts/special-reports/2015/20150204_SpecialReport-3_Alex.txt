[00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:10.573]  A three-year-old Aisley McCarthy was buried today in Elkhorn.
[00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:19.996]  Her family tells me she died Monday morning at Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines, not even 48 hours after she started showing flu-like symptoms.
[00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:33.099]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News, and here's a story that I wanted to share with you, and I want you to get this out to anybody you know, especially if someone you know out there is thinking about getting the flu shot.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.445]  Family's devastation after their healthy 3-year-old daughter dies from flu less than 72 hours after she began feeling unwell.
[00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.829]  And this is the story of Azalee McCarthy, a beautiful little 3-year-old girl,
[00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:53.461]  Who started complaining of symptoms just after Christmas and in 72 hours, her parents were holding her in a wrapped up cloth at the hospital as she died in their arms.
[00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:55.163]  Very heartbreaking story.
[00:00:55.884 --> 00:01:03.032]  And it really disturbed me as I read this article and then went to the source link, which is the Des Moines Register, but here's what they had to say at Daily Mail.
[00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:12.021]  She began complaining to her mother that her legs hurt so much she couldn't walk and in less than 72 hours she'd be dead at Children's Hospital in Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.423]  And of course the family is shocked and confused.
[00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:18.787]  They don't know why she contacted this and was dead such a short while later.
[00:01:19.628 --> 00:01:22.531]  But here's where it gets really interesting here in the Des Moines Register.
[00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.313]  Healthy Iowa three-year-old dies from the flu.
[00:01:25.914 --> 00:01:26.754]  Third sentence down.
[00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:32.379]  She was healthy and she had her flu shot, said Amber McCarthy, Aslee's mother.
[00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.380]  The whole thing is unreal.
[00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.501]  And it is unreal.
[00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:48.774]  When you think about it in this day and age and we have all this medical technology that a little girl could get a flu shot and then become sick with the flu and actually the same types of flu that are in the flu shot and then die in 72 hours.
[00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:02.293]  But what really angered me was a quote from the health department there in Polk County, and this is Nola Anger who said, "...if people would get the flu shot, it can limit the severity of flu symptoms if they do get it.
[00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:05.015]  The shot offers protections for other strains.
[00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:07.896]  This is a serious illness and can affect healthy people."
[00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.877]  Apparently, it affected this little girl.
[00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:19.100]  So, they say in the Des Moines article that she came down with influenza type A and B. Let's look at what's in the flu shot.
[00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:21.938]  Here it is on the CDC website.
[00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:34.451]  Traditional flu vaccines, called trivalent vaccines, are made to protect against three flu viruses, including influenza A, H1N1, influenza A, H3N2, and an influenza B virus.
[00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:41.859]  So, if you go back to the Des Moines Register article, you'll see that she tested positive for influenza A and B at the time she was admitted into the hospital.
[00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.603]  This year my main tip is to not get the flu vaccine.
[00:02:47.403 --> 00:03:00.715]  It's amazing how many people are sick and even the deaths that have occurred because what they're doing now is they're using these trivalent vaccines that protect against three strains of the flu and this year the 2014-2015 vaccine
[00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:11.348]  Contains influenza A H3N2 and it contains influenza A H1N1.
[00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:12.109]  That's right.
[00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:19.880]  They actually put the H1N1 in this year's flu vaccine and influenza B. Now let's look at what else is in the flu shot.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.902]  This is from DrTinpenny.com, the truth about the flu shot.
[00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:48.878]  It also contains egg proteins, including avian contaminant viruses, gelatin, which can cause allergies, polysorbate 80, which is known to cause severe allergic reactions, and also is associated with infertility in mice, formaldehyde, Triton X-100, a strong detergent, table sugar, resin, known to cause allergic reactions, and antibiotic anthimerosal, mercury, which is still in the multi-dose viral flu shot vaccines.
[00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:55.365]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:03:55.846 --> 00:04:02.273]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:09.641]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:18.991]  So these are also the things that you're injecting into your children and into your elderly parents and into yourself if you get the flu shot in addition to three different types of flu viruses.
[00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:25.437]  Doctors told the family the cause of death was a combination of influenza A, influenza B, and sepsis.
[00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:32.562]  The family says before Saturday, Aisley was perfectly healthy and had no pre-existing medical conditions.
[00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:38.284]  And so the mother in this story, Amber, is left with no child and wondering why.
[00:04:38.384 --> 00:04:39.324]  She did everything right.
[00:04:39.364 --> 00:04:43.845]  She said she had her child vaccinated, she even got the flu shot, and this is what happened.
[00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.305]  It's still the same outcome.
[00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.926]  She succumbed to the virus that she was supposed to be protected against.
[00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.487]  That's because it really doesn't offer you protection.
[00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:51.827]  And you can read that on the insert.
[00:04:52.307 --> 00:04:56.511]  They just say that so they can get these people out there and get these flu vaccines into people.
[00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:57.773]  It's a money-making scheme.
[00:04:58.013 --> 00:04:58.674]  And what does it do?
[00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:03.579]  For most people, it makes them sick, which will then make them go to the doctor, which then they'll be prescribed more drugs.
[00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.100]  And don't take my word for it.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.445]  There's countless other people out there that have done studies on the flu vaccine and its ineffectiveness.
[00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:22.373]  They found that if someone, your neighbor or kids in school or anybody that you hang out with got the flu vaccine, that it can spread to other people for up to 17 to 25 days later.
[00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:24.294]  So you need to look at this story.
[00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:25.635]  I'm providing the links below.
[00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:26.616]  You can read it for yourself.
[00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:32.119]  And you need to feel bad for this family because they were caught up in the ruse.
[00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.782]  They were caught up in the medical industrial complex ruse that says, hey, if you get the flu shot, you'll be protected.
[00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.884]  But as we've seen time and time again, people who get the flu shot end up getting sick with the flu.
[00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:44.907]  With regard to risk, there is no question, Campbell.
[00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.632]  It would be dishonest to say that we know for sure the vaccine is going to be safe for everybody.
[00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:51.875]  Ronan was rushed to Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland.
[00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:57.622]  Doctors there tried to save him, but Burgess says he went without oxygen for too long.
[00:05:58.055 --> 00:06:00.657]  ...and suffered brain damage that was irreversible.
[00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:02.758]  He died days later.
[00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:09.942]  She's sharing her story to warn others that the flu shot is not always enough to protect children from the H1N1 virus.
[00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:12.363]  Her nine-year-old daughter was happy and healthy.
[00:06:12.944 --> 00:06:18.247]  But just three days after receiving a flu shot, Mary Sue was paralyzed, diagnosed with a rare disease.
[00:06:18.907 --> 00:06:19.848]  So what happened?
[00:06:20.253 --> 00:06:24.459]  Just a few weeks ago, Amber had gotten a flu shot, but she managed to get the flu anyway.
[00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:30.567]  Within hours of Amber experiencing flu-like symptoms, she landed in the hospital fighting for her life.
[00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:32.330]  I can't even read.
[00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.835]  I used to love to read.
[00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.136]  I love to sew and crochet.
[00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.697]  I can't do that now.
[00:06:42.578 --> 00:06:44.339]  That flu shot did me in.
[00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.079]  I'm going to get it.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.680]  Yes.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.380]  If that helps at all.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.161]  But I'll tell you my wife is not getting me as her kids.
[00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:51.423]  Because I've got four of them and when I go home I'm not Dr. Oz, I'm Mr. Oz.

[00:07:07.812 --> 00:07:09.172]  Took that, boom, wipes them out.
[00:07:09.392 --> 00:07:11.733]  But that's just my opinion, and that's just my personal history.
[00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:14.495]  Of course, you need to consult your doctor for anything like this.
[00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:17.456]  This has been Rob Dufour for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:43.178]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:07:43.318 --> 00:07:50.147]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:07:50.447 --> 00:07:52.429]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
