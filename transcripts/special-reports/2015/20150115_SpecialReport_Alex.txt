[00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.724]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:18.051]  Now, have you ever dated someone and felt like you actually knew that person, and then months, maybe years later, found out you really didn't know who that person was?
[00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:31.401]  Well, this story is almost like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, except Mr. Smith is a NASCAR driver, and Mrs. Smith owns a contracting company and also heads up an armed forces foundation as well out of Washington, D.C.
[00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:33.894]  Meet Mrs. Smith.
[00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:35.395]  Have you been a fan boy?
[00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:39.376]  Have you violated international law?
[00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.479]  This is a story right now that's on ESPN.com.
[00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.760]  Kurt Busch says ex was a trained killer.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.283]  The NASCAR driver known as The Outlaw testified Tuesday he believes his ex-girlfriend is a trained assassin dispatched on covert missions around the world.
[00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:04.087]  Now Kurt Busch said that everyone on the outside can call me crazy, but I've been on the inside.
[00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:04.948]  I know what's going on.
[00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:06.088]  I've seen it firsthand.
[00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.130]  His attorney, Rusty Harden, questioned why he still believed Patricia Driscoll is a hired killer.
[00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:26.514]  And in an interview late Tuesday, Driscoll called Busch's assertion ludicrous, saying that he's taken it straight from a fictional movie script that she has been working on for eight years and that he has thus far proofread.
[00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:39.686]  Now Bush peering in court again over Driscoll's request for a no order contact continued to push for his legal team to discredit his ex as a scorned woman out to destroy his career, portraying her as a character fit for a screenplay.
[00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:53.945]  He recounted one time in El Paso, Texas when he said Driscoll left in camouflage gear and then later on returned in a black trench coat with blood spattered gown underneath.
[00:01:54.065 --> 00:02:04.291]  A day earlier, Bush said his ex-girlfriend told him she was a mercenary who killed people for a living and had shown him pictures of bodies and the gunshot wounds.
[00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:10.775]  Bush said Tuesday that Driscoll had claimed that the female character in Zero Dark Thirty was loosely based off of her
[00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:14.197]  And a few other females within the government.
[00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:18.000]  Now here is a brief background on Patricia Driscoll.
[00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:22.513]  Patricia is an American businesswoman and author and native of El Paso, Texas.
[00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:34.335]  Driscoll now heads a national charity, the Armed Forces Foundation, and she is the CEO of a surveillance system company, Frontline Defense Systems, LLC, both out of Washington, D.C.
[00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:41.357]  Last month, Michael Donchev, who served as a personal assistant to Bush and Driscoll, said an ailing Driscoll told him in September,
[00:02:41.957 --> 00:02:49.904]  That she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border.
[00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.146]  A story Donchev considered far-fetched.
[00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:58.070]  But Donchev said Dreskel also asserted that she was a trained assassin for the U.S.
[00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.133]  government and once told him, I take down foreign governments.
[00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:02.514]  I own Washington.
[00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.255]  Well, here it is.
[00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:05.156]  What do you think?
[00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:08.153]  Is this just a regular soccer mom?
[00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:12.114]  Is this just little old Patricia Driscoll who is a businesswoman?
[00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:15.595]  Or is she in fact a trained assassin?
[00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:18.556]  Or is Kurt Busch out of his mind?
[00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:27.938]  Has he driven that NASCAR one too many times and breathed in those fumes that have completely made him lose his mind in every way possible?
[00:03:28.278 --> 00:03:29.198]  And he has completely
[00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:40.802]  Come up with this, you know, fake story that she is this Vatican assassin who goes out on late night missions, comes back in blood spatter gowns and runs Washington.
[00:03:41.063 --> 00:03:45.247]  Well, let us know what you think in the comments below here on the YouTube video.
[00:03:45.568 --> 00:03:48.011]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:55.719]  Hi, I'm Shane Steiner.
[00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.023]  A lot of you have been following my progress using Supermale Vitality.
[00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:01.926]  The last 19 weeks has been an incredible experience.
[00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:07.352]  I was feeling a little down and lethargic during the holidays, and none of the supplements that I was taking were doing any good.
[00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:12.138]  That's when my longtime friend from high school, Alex Jones, introduced me to Supermale Vitality.
[00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:13.580]  I was a little skeptical at first.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.642]  Not only would I have the energy to work out and go to the gym, but it was actually the changes were happening to my body a lot more rapidly.
[00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:26.743]  My whole mood, my libido, everything had completely changed.
[00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:33.765]  The concentrated organic herbs, they stimulate your natural systems to produce the natural hormones that you need.
[00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:45.536]  I just really wanted to bulk up and hit it hard and I went in for about the first five weeks and was lifting heavy weight and just really hitting it hard and I gained 20 pounds of muscle immediately.
[00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:48.378]  Since that, I've decided I was going to lose some weight and slim down.
[00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:51.541]  I just changed up my workout a little bit and 35 pounds came off.
[00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.902]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:53.863]  This is not a gimmick.
[00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:54.444]  It's real.
[00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:55.645]  Super Male Vitality.
