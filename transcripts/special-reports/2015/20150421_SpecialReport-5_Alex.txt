[00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:12.446]  Good afternoon.
[00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:24.973]  Today, as part of an international coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab countries, our men and women in uniform continue to fight against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.
[00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.956]  More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists.
[00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:35.399]  We're disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move.
[00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:47.809]  We're destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations.
[00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:54.587]  The highly produced ISIS video says, America thinks it's safe because of the geographical location.
[00:00:54.627 --> 00:01:02.109]  Thus you see it invades the Muslim lands and it thinks that the army of the Jihad won't reach into their lands.
[00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.550]  We have been, we outside, have been researching the Jihadi threat online for over a decade.
[00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.212]  Follow their steps, monitor their activities, and study their activities online.
[00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:20.073]  Once again, SITE discovers terror threat against America.
[00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:22.714]  A month-old alleged threat against U.S.
[00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:28.436]  service personnel by the Islamic State was followed up by a new warning from the Northern Command on Monday.
[00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:42.780]  The official use warning by the military command urging soldiers to hide their personal information online follows the release of a purported IS video claiming the group will engage in another 9-11 attack against the United States.
[00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:55.689]  According to Cite, the video is part of a Twitter campaign attributed to the Islamic State under the hashtag, pound we will burn US again.
[00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.692]  The tweets are threatening to unleash a new 9-11 attack on America.
[00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:09.762]  In a time of lone wolf attacks, and Americans and other Westerners pledging to the Islamic State, this kind of campaign should not be taken lightly, Cite director Rita Katz said.
[00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:18.766]  The Twitter campaign, along with other ones like it, in the past shows the Islamic State's skill in forcing itself into Western conversations, she added.
[00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:26.109]  Katz believes the campaign shows a unified and structured method of online mobilization by the Islamic State and its followers.
[00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.571]  A video coinciding with the social media campaign threatens every American on the globe.
[00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:36.393]  Tweets attributed to the terror group promise attacks like those that occurred in France and Canada.
[00:02:37.213 --> 00:02:50.057]  The Site Intelligence Group consists of Katz and two senior advisors, one of whom is Bruce Hoffman, the Corporate Chair in Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency at the RAND Corporation, and former Director of the RAND's Washington, D.C.
[00:02:50.157 --> 00:02:52.618]  office, according to James F. Tracy.
[00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.761]  We're at 1776 Main Street in Santa Monica, California.
[00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:05.943]  And yes, you do see a mushroom cloud behind me made up of giant chain links.
[00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.879]  This is the home of the Rand Corporation Complex.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.261]  The most important...
[00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.915]  and powerful globalist think tank in the world.
[00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:21.100]  Dr. Strangelove, the Stanley Kubrick film, made in the early 1960s, is about this organization.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.684]  They developed the plan of mutually assured destruction against the Russians.
[00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:28.767]  They developed mid-air refueling.
[00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:31.589]  They developed systems analysis.
[00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.172]  They developed the futurist paradigms of the Pentagon.
[00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:38.375]  They developed the transhumanist ideas
[00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.496]  Or repackage the transhumanist ideas of Aldous Huxley.
[00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:47.138]  These guys are the ones that put out public reports 15 years ago.
[00:03:47.218 --> 00:04:04.023]  It's how I knew what was going to unfold about how they were going to militarize police, how they were going to federalize police, how they would build threat fusion centers, how the system would set up a homeland security grid under NORTHCOM with federal command bases used to spy on the citizenry.
[00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:11.951]  They write big reports on how to manipulate people through financial systems and how to sell them on tyranny individually.
[00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:20.898]  And they have the nerve in all of their nomenclature to obsess on the Founding Fathers in 1776 and freedom and the rest of it with the Rand Corporation.
[00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:31.249]  Is the exact opposite, and no other group has their documents taken by the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, CFR, and then put into policy like this organization.
[00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:35.333]  The Rand Corporation is at the heart of the New World Order.
[00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:42.601]  It's part of that inner coterie, or almost a group of ring-wraith organizations that serve this dark system.
[00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:47.522]  In 2003 and 2004, Cite received financial support from the U.S.
[00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:47.943]  government.
[00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:53.944]  Also in the early 2000s, Cite was on contract providing consulting services to the FBI.
[00:04:54.285 --> 00:05:01.787]  It would appear that Cite has abandoned its non-profit status and now relies on corporate and individual subscriptions for revenue.
[00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:08.469]  In 2005, the private mercenary contractor, Blackwater, hailed Cite as an invaluable resource.
[00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:22.579]  One of CITE's founders, Rita Katz, is a government insider with close connections to former terrorism czar Richard Clark and his staff in the White House, as well as investigators in the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:35.908]  ICE's account on social media indicated that within a short time they will be releasing the video, only we actually had that video beforehand and were able to beat them with the release.
[00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:43.101]  According to Sourcewatch, a number of the video site is claimed to have discovered, were subsequently found to be frauds.
[00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.626]  John Bowne, InfoWars.com
[00:05:53.328 --> 00:05:59.433]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:59.453 --> 00:06:02.815]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.517]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:06:04.557 --> 00:06:10.781]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:16.806]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:20.708]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:20.908 --> 00:06:23.810]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:31.995]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.316]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:35.397]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:35.757 --> 00:06:44.509]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
