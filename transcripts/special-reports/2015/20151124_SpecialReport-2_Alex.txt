[00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:13.689]  You may have noticed this is a version of the cyber security bill passed in Congress with the Senate voting 74 to 21 to pass it.
[00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.454]  All in the name of a cyber defense to protect the American people and more importantly big business from hackers.
[00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:22.256]  And that's all you need to know America.
[00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:23.176]  Go back to sleep.
[00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:28.060]  What they didn't tell you was the NSA and big business slipped a Trojan horse
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.464]  Pass the American people once again to allow them to spy on you.
[00:00:32.864 --> 00:00:34.045]  Yes, you.
[00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:45.475]  Wired Magazine reports privacy advocates and civil liberties groups see CISA as a free pass that allows companies to monitor users and share their information with the government without a warrant.
[00:00:45.615 --> 00:01:03.524]  While offering a backdoor that circumvents any laws that might protect users' privacy, the incentive and the framework it creates is for companies to quickly and massively collect user information and ship it to the government, says Mark Jaycox, Legislative Analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:10.227]  As soon as you do, he continues, you obtain broad immunity, even if you violated privacy law.
[00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:17.551]  Even the Department of Homeland Security agrees that the latest CISA bill could sweep away many important privacy protections.
[00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:39.882]  Breitbart reports, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, a Democrat who recently allied with Senator Rand Paul to water down provisions of the Patriot Act, said the bill virtually guarantees that private information unrelated to cybersecurity will be shared with the government, and said that the bill was a direct pipeline to the NSA.
[00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.477]  Even with the Manager's Amendment, the core privacy issues are not being dealt with.
[00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:54.082]  The fact is, it is voluntary for companies.
[00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:59.206]  It will be mandatory for their customers.
[00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:02.809]  And the fact is, the companies
[00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:26.661]  During the voting process of CISA, the Senate rejected all of the privacy amendments that would have protected average citizens' right to privacy.
[00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:28.623]  But how exactly did they do that?
[00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:33.466]  TechDirt breaks down the geek speak detailing the NSA's unconstitutional
[00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:38.430]  Desperation to collect data related to innocent law-abiding Americans.
[00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.978]  The NSA and FBI, and CIA for that matter, frequently make use of backdoor searches of the upstream data, a capability that was approved in 2011.
[00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:55.564]  Basically, the rules changed so that the intelligence community could sniff through data that was deemed collected incidentally.
[00:02:56.084 --> 00:03:04.126]  And that includes basically anything that is picked up in the upstream collection of data under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.
[00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:14.769]  CISA is likely to be the key piece for letting the NSA and FBI warrantlessly spy on Americans after the FISA court limited that ability a few years ago.
[00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:30.921]  Is it any wonder when a $2.8 billion taxpayer-funded JLIN surveillance blimp becomes headline news as the average American citizen shirks when they clearly witness a criminal surveillance state goliath growing far too big to control?
[00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:36.085]  The NSA grows stronger as it collects more of our personal information.
[00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:39.087]  The US Constitution grows weaker.
[00:03:39.307 --> 00:03:41.469]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:55.273]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:58.635]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:00.317]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:06.603]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:12.608]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
