[00:00:01.957 --> 00:00:02.557]  You see that?
[00:00:02.577 --> 00:00:05.178]  The top link on the internet is the Prudge link.
[00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.480]  Social credit score to determine who can buy a gun.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:20.845]  And they admit that all of the smart devices, like Alexa from Amazon and others, are watching and listening to everything you do in real time.
[00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:28.928]  And then reporting it back to DARPA and a new agency with leftist psychiatrists that are going to decide who can own a gun and who can't.
[00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:33.151]  But this is just the beginning of total surveillance beyond 1984.
[00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:34.973]  All these devices have been listening to you.
[00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:36.774]  They've been creating dossiers on you.
[00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:44.599]  Facebook now admits they're going to use these dossiers to basically create a social score where if you're not a good globalist, you won't be allowed to buy or sell.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.980]  This is the mark of the beast.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.482]  And Trump, the Washington Post says, supports it.
[00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:52.965]  We don't know if that's true, but Trump needs to come out and repudiate this or we need to start impeachment of Trump.
[00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:54.126]  And I'm sorry.
[00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.753]  But this is out of control.
[00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.060]  We're live right now covering it all at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.743]  One of the top stories in the country right now.
[00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:03.448]  Please share this video and fight back against Big Brother.
