[00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.008]  Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15.
[00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.009]  Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15.
[00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.009]  Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15.
[00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.009]  I've got a message for the scumbag anti-American Beto O'Rourke.
[00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:17.198]  You're down here thinking you can tame Texas and conquer us and destroy us like California.
[00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.880]  You think you can turn us into your disarmed slaves?
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.982]  Beto O'Rourke, you're well known for fantasizing and writing essays about murdering children.
[00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:29.164]  And you even got away with a hit-and-run and burglary.
[00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:31.346]  You're a dirty criminal.
[00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:35.532]  You've got your own bodyguards because you're hooked into that billionaire wife of yours.
[00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:38.457]  How dare you try to demonize American gun owners.
[00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:43.985]  Just in case you didn't know, this country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns in 1775.
[00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:45.707]  That's why we got July 4th.
[00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:50.993]  So I'm going to tell you what George Washington and the Continental Congress told King George III.
[00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:55.237]  You're not getting our firearms because we're free men, you little piece of crap!
[00:00:55.798 --> 00:01:01.864]  America and the world's glad, though, that you finally got the guts to admit your plan with the rest of those scumbag Democrats.
[00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.346]  Beto O'Rourke, you're on notice!
[00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.206]  You're not getting our firearms ever scumbag!
[00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:15.686]  For decades we warned you.
[00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.521]  The Democratic Party, working for the globalists, wants your guns.
[00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:22.503]  That's always been their goal.
[00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:28.246]  In 150 other plus nations, they've all taken them through the same formula.
[00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:35.249]  Take a few mass shootings, demonize gun owners, start registration, and then confiscation of all semi-autos.
[00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.810]  That's about 90% of guns.
[00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.312]  Then, they ban the single shot.
[00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:45.351]  And the public lives under increased crime, and of course, tyrannical governments.
[00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:54.059]  On your journey to slavery, the number one signpost is that they take your speech, and then they take your right to defend yourself.
[00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.004]  Well, Beto O'Rourke is the champion of, hell yes, I'll confiscate your semi-automatics.
[00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:06.108]   But all the Democrats on the stage at the last debate said, We're coming for your guns.
[00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:07.009]  We're going to confiscate them.
[00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.795]  They're normalizing this after denying it for decades, when again, it's been their plan all along.
[00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.277]  Their own white papers and internal documents show.
[00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:20.967]   Well, the day after this happened, I went to our graphics department.
[00:02:20.987 --> 00:02:23.168]  I said, we've got to have some shirt countering Beto.
[00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:26.149]  He's come out with a shirt saying, hell yes, I'm going to confiscate your guns.
[00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.349]  Hell yes, I'm going to start a civil war, basically.
[00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.350]  Hell yes, I'm going to say your right to defend yourself is criminal.
[00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.251]  He's got all the bodyguards in the world.
[00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.991]  His wife's a billionaire.
[00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:37.432]  His family's a bunch of scammers.
[00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:39.152]  His father-in-law's worth $28 billion.
[00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.273]  He's got private security.
[00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:44.714]  But see, the average person doesn't.
[00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.995]  So to counter that shirt, I couldn't figure out what to come up with.
[00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:51.608]  So then one of my old buddies...
[00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:53.794]  A great Patriot veteran.
[00:02:54.114 --> 00:03:01.399]  He texted me this design and it's even made right here in Austin, Texas by a Patriot-owned group called Pie Pitters.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.480]  Beto Knott.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.521]  Yes, it's a pun.
[00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:04.221]  Better not.
[00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:05.222]  Beto Knott.
[00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:06.343]  It says it all.
[00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:07.664]  It's a simple message.
[00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:11.567]  It's got the AR-15 or the M4 variant.
[00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:13.809]  It's got the Texas with the Army Star right there.
[00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.452]  On the back, it's got a big, nice, square InfoWars.com.
[00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:21.855]  Now, this is a limited edition shirt just like the Betsy Ross shirt.
[00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.834]  And your purchase funds the operation.
[00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:30.318]  They're only $19.95 and they're being printed as we speak on this Friday while I'm shooting this.
[00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:32.979]  They'll be shipping out early next week.
[00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.262]  Again, made and printed right here in the USA in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:41.004]  You'll definitely want this Beto Knott shirt.
[00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:45.166]  We have it in dark gray, light gray, and super light gray.
[00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:45.907]  It's almost white.
[00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:47.188]  They're all excellent.
[00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:51.009]  I'm also going to have them print up some that are in Army Olive Green.
[00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.151]  That'll get out of the shopping cart probably by the time you visit it, because that's the next thing I'm going to do.
[00:03:55.771 --> 00:04:01.874]  And this will help fund our First Amendment battle to defend the Second Amendment and all the other basic rights.
[00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:07.163]   So again, Take action with the First Amendment and let these scumbags know.
[00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:13.328]  And let the collapsed California invasion force that's taken over Texas know that we're not backing down.
[00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.530]  But regardless of where you live, in the U.S.
[00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.894]  or outside of it, Beto is now a worldwide symbol of disarming the people.
[00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:20.996]  Hell yes!
[00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:22.457]  We're gonna take your AR-15.
[00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:29.044]  Just like Mao Zedong, Hitler, or Stalin, Mao Zedong said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:34.149]  That's why the UN says they only want governments to be armed so they have a power monopoly.
[00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.452]  A power monopoly is called a dictatorship.
[00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:40.493]  Now, you just saw Beto say, hell yeah, I'm gonna take your guns.
[00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.374]  But let's play Kamala Harris.
[00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:50.518]  In recent days, former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:58.462]  They said, I'm going to issue an executive order, Biden saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[00:04:58.482 --> 00:04:59.963]  Does the Vice President have a point there?
[00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:03.062]  I mean I would just say, "Hey Joe."
[00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:06.663]  Instead of saying, "No we can't," let's say, "Yes we can."
[00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:08.662]  [laughter]
[00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:10.662]  Let's be constitutional.
[00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:12.662]  We gotta constitutional.
[00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:14.662]  They're calling Donald Trump a dictator all day.
[00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:16.055]  But they're the ones.
[00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.474]  that are calling for overturning the courts and the Congress and making the President a dictatorship.
[00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:26.277]  Now we know why the Founders had the Second Amendment.
[00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:28.038]  It's not just to stop criminals.
[00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.960]  It's not just to kill your dinner.
[00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:32.962]  It's to protect against tyranny.
[00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:36.405]  And that's why they try to take our firearms, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:36.746 --> 00:05:37.706]  1776 will commence again.
[00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:43.430]   So be sure and get your Beto Knott shirt We've got it in all sizes.
[00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.331]  Fits men and women.
[00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:47.632]  And again, it funds InfoWars while the Globos are trying to shut us down.
[00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:49.232]  A total 360 win.
[00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:51.653]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[00:05:51.853 --> 00:06:00.015]  And you better believe, I'm so sick of seeing Beto stickers in Austin, Texas, I'm going to wear this sucker out there to trigger some Libtards in a big way.
[00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:03.196]  Exercise your free speech in the face of these bullies.
[00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.576]  In the face of these tyrants.
[00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:09.338]  Get your Beto Not shirt at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:11.700]  A lot of shirts are coming out to counter him.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.260]  I've seen them.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.504]  This is heads above the rest.
[00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:16.204]  It's awesome.
[00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:22.851]  So get yours at infoorestore.com today or call toll free 24 hours a day, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.335]  Get the Beto Knot.
[00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:32.160]  Put your hands on our damn guns, you dirty scumbag.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:42.805]  I'm Alex Jones for InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com thanking you all for your support and telling you it's a real pleasure to fight alongside other fellow Americans for liberty.
[00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:43.985]  God bless you all.
[00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:46.646]  One more note, you little buck-toothed psychopath.
[00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:51.829]  I know you're stupid, but the controllers that pull your strings, they know what they're doing.
[00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.970]  They're trying to cause a civil war in this nation, dirtbag.
[00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.088]  So I'm putting you and your controllers on notice.
[00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.790]  You will be held accountable for what you're trying to do.
[00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:05.413]  How the media hypes up mass shootings, all the studies show, actually causes the mass shootings.
[00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:08.115]  You've got the blood on your filthy hands.
[00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:14.339]  And I know you instinctively want to dominate the American people, the only country you basically haven't disarmed, but you're going to fail.
[00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:24.967]  And we're going to expose big pharma that you and others are hooked into, whose own drugs, their so-called antidepressants, cause people to commit mass murder, and the inserts even say it, and almost every mass shooter is on it.
[00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:34.138]  So in between the media putting the idea out there and the drugs that turn people into these zombies, well, you get a few of these events, you can then try to pin on us.
[00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.679]  You know what, mister?
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.501]  We're not buying your bull.
[00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:39.883]  And Texas sees right through you.
[00:07:40.323 --> 00:07:42.545]  Despite all the election fraud, you still lost.
[00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:44.146]  Because you're a loser.
[00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:45.367]  You're a puppet.
[00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:47.169]  And you have failed.
[00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:48.490]  And you will continue to fail.
[00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.613]  Because America is waking up to pieces of filth like you.
