[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.219]  (upbeat music)
[00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:29.405]  Trump is in downtown Dallas, and there may be a special guest at the rally tonight.
[00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:40.248]  I don't know how an individual could get to Austin and Dallas in less than an hour, but if any man can do it, I think his name might be Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:55.211]  Alright, I may or may not have some breaking news to report right now, but we don't know what's going on, so I'm not sure if I even want to mention this, but apparently people are having trouble accessing banned out video.
[00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:57.174]  And I will tell you this.
[00:00:58.775 --> 00:00:59.576]  Okay, it's back up.
[00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:03.839]  We have massive DDoS attacks happening on us regularly.
[00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.781]  They've tried to take down BannedOutVideo with it multiple times.
[00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:09.362]  But BannedOutVideo is still working.
[00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:12.264]  You can tune in to BannedOutVideo to get all of our live coverage tonight.
[00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:15.687]  Myself and Leanne McAdoo will be with you till at least 9 o'clock.
[00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:20.758]  And we will be hearing from InfoWars reporters on the ground.
[00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:28.160]  Harrison Smith is down there, Greg Reese, Will Johnson, who normally hosts Firepower, right now on Bandot Video, is down there as well.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.162]  And of course, President Trump will be going live in the near future.
[00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:37.583]  We'll have that live coverage for you right here at Bandot Video.
[00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.504]  In fact, you know what?
[00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:41.645]  We're literally running around here.
[00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.485]  I'm running around here with my head cut off, basically.
[00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.306]  I don't even know, what clock are we going off, guys?
[00:01:46.937 --> 00:01:48.338]  Sorry, this is totally unprofessional.
[00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:50.860]  I literally don't even know what clock we're going off of.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.121]  I've been running around here like a chicken with my head cut off.
[00:01:56.243 --> 00:01:57.925]  Okay, so, okay, thank you guys.
[00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:59.105]  Sorry for doing that live on air.
[00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:01.567]  Alright, this is just how we do here at InfoWars.
[00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:07.011]  I know Leanne McAdoo remembers these days from all her years spent here.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.432]  But so here we are.
[00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:10.353]  It's incredible to be in this moment.
[00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:16.305]   And you know, maybe People can say, oh my gosh, you're fear-mongering.
[00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.826]  Trump's not gonna be assassinated tonight.
[00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.387]  Okay, well, maybe not tonight.
[00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.409]  You know damn well these people have thought about assassinating Trump.
[00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.230]  They've probably even tried it.
[00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.471]  You had his motorcade get rammed off a road in Springfield, Missouri.
[00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:29.472]  You had a guy run up on the podium.
[00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:34.215]  I believe it was at a airfield in Ohio, I think it was.
[00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:39.518]  Nancy Pelosi fondling bullets on her wrist saying, we're not gonna stop Trump.
[00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:41.159]  Looks like a skeksi.
[00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:43.782]  So this is all going on.
[00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.124]  So yeah, of course they want Trump dead.
[00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:47.585]  They killed JFK.
[00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:52.810]  Hell, they killed JFK Jr., who was running against Hillary, died in a plane crash.
[00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.071]  Oh, nothing to see here.
[00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:59.195]  Hillary Clinton starts her political career with her opponent dying in a plane crash.
[00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:03.399]  So I'm just going off on a tangent right now, but Leanne McAtee was in studio.
[00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.760]  We're going to be covering the Trump rally.
[00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:13.779]  Leanne, what do you think, what is the difference between a Trump rally today and a Trump rally in 2016?
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.643]  What is the biggest difference or approach or mentality, do you think?
[00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:23.967]  Well, it seems like the Trump supporters are actually getting a little bit more vocal.
[00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:33.975]  I think in 2016 they were still kind of afraid to wear the MAGA hats and to be out there and to let their friends know loud and proud, I'm a Trump supporter.
[00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:41.719]  I think now it's coming around that people are starting to say, look, you're not going to intimidate me and tell me what clothing I'm allowed to wear or not.
[00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.600]  And we're going to show up in droves.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.904]  And in fact, they're putting themselves in harm's way, knowing they're going to show up to an event where Antifa is going to be there trying to attack them.
[00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:53.126]  Yeah, I haven't seen any rabid protesters yet.
[00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:53.366]  Right.
[00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:59.006]   So they're, you know, people are getting more brave and standing up for their president.
[00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.326]   But I don't think, I'm curious, I don't know what kind of scene we're going to see tonight
[00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:06.926]   in Dallas because it seems to be, you know, much more conservative area.
[00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:10.445]  Yeah, I haven't seen any rabid protesters yet.
[00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:11.445]  Right.
[00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:14.326]  I haven't heard of any rabid protesters.
[00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:19.405]   You know, if they were holding the rally here in Austin, I think, yes, we would definitely
[00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.006]  see some rabid protesters.
[00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:25.105]  But Dallas, I think... Do you miss the Austin Antifa?
[00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:26.426]  They're so friendly.
[00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:27.766]  I do not.
[00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:34.348]  You know, I don't miss wondering if my food's been poisoned at the local vegetarian restaurant.
[00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:39.049]  Because that's where they like to hang out and I do too.
[00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.133]   So, you know, I don't know, I feel much safer now knowing my food is Just straight up lovely.
[00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:56.740]  What do you make of all the fake polls saying, oh, Biden could defeat Trump, Sanders could defeat Trump, Warren could defeat Trump, a baked potato could defeat Trump.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.362]  I mean, not a baked potato could get 50,000 people at a rally.
[00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:01.243]  Right.
[00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:10.889]  Why do the Democrats think that they can just beat reality, pun not intended, they literally think they can trump reality with their media and people won't see 50,000 people at a Trump rally?
[00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:11.722]  Right.
[00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:15.605]  And that's the thing, are they polling any of these people that are at the Trump rally?
[00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:16.506]  I've never been polled.
[00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.147]  What areas are they polling?
[00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:22.631]  Are they polling just, you know, certain moms groups on Facebook?
[00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.513]  Like, where are they getting these poll numbers from is what I'm curious.
[00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:26.754]  No one's ever polled me.
[00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:28.256]  I've never even been asked.
[00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:30.357]  I've yet to meet anyone who's been polled.
[00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:30.918]  Right.
[00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:36.985]  I mean, I've never been even asked, hey, would you mind taking a quick minute to take this survey?
[00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:42.491]  Even nothing's popped up on my computer, so I don't know who is actually being polled.
[00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:52.221]  And of course, we see when they show you the amount of Democrats they polled versus Republicans, it's always skewed to heavy on the Democrats.
[00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:56.706]  Which is already disingenuous because there's probably more Republicans to begin with.
[00:05:56.746 --> 00:06:00.750]  So that means they're really distorting the field when they do that.
[00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.932]  And of course they've been doing that forever.
[00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:04.974]  This is how they get away with the fake news.
[00:06:05.694 --> 00:06:09.458]  I think that Americans, though, are realizing that the television news is fake.
[00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:11.139]  They're going with their own gut.
[00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.340]  They're going with their own eyes.
[00:06:13.447 --> 00:06:19.191]  And the Project Veritas release is huge, but that's the thing, they try to act like, oh, no, no, no, there's no such thing as Project Veritas.
[00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:21.472]  Project Veritas didn't expose CNN.
[00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:22.092]  Uh-uh.
[00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:27.876]  CNN producers didn't wish Trump would die quickly so that they could stop talking about him.
[00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:39.423]  You know, God forbid they cover things fairly and accurately and report the truth, you know, but they have to, they just like to not cover him at all, and so wishing him dead is, makes the most sense.
[00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:41.224]  Would be the most convenient for CNN.
[00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:48.319]  And I asked myself this the other day, is Trump the white knight, the dark knight, or the dark prince?
[00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:52.498]  Because if they kill Trump, he almost becomes the Dark Knight.
[00:06:53.259 --> 00:07:03.306]  Because they'll kill him, and then they'll kill his legacy, and they'll act like, oh, history will say Trump's a racist, treasonous, you know, whatever, corrupt politician.
[00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:07.709]  Of course, the real reality is he was the White Knight, but that's the Dark Knight.
[00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:14.328]   It's the white knight that dies in darkness and allows himself in death to expose the
[00:07:14.328 --> 00:07:15.328]  corrupt system.
[00:07:15.328 --> 00:07:17.528]  So if they do kill Trump, he'll be the dark knight.
[00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:20.848]   But the whole system that was against him, they can't get away with it.
[00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.848]  It's like, OK, they got away with murdering Epstein.
[00:07:23.848 --> 00:07:24.848]  Or can they?
[00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:25.848]  They got away with JFK.
[00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.848]  They got away with Epstein.
[00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:29.288]  Everyone just seems to have forgotten about it.
[00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:39.143]  This, like, number one man who was going to be able to take down massive pedophile ring with major elites gets murdered in prison.
[00:07:39.223 --> 00:07:43.265]  Oh, he hung himself because the guards just so happened to both fall asleep.
[00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:48.146]  I could try to hang myself with toilet paper for 10 years and never do it.
[00:07:49.526 --> 00:07:50.347]  Bring me some toilet paper.
[00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:51.307]  I'll try it right here on air.
[00:07:52.247 --> 00:07:53.729]  I'll try to Epstein myself on air.
[00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.094]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's just none of it makes sense.
[00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:01.420]  But even the media themselves, they're not, they did not report on it afterward.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.902]  They were just like, nothing to see here, folks.
[00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:03.663]  Well, he's dead.
[00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:06.828]  I guess that takes all the horror right along with him.
[00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:08.090]  By the way.
[00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:12.098]  This has been almost totally non-reported and I let myself down.
[00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:12.499]  Oh!
[00:08:13.299 --> 00:08:15.982]  They actually want me to try to Epstein my... Here we go!
[00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:22.269]  A roll of... This is the old Deep State Toilet Pepper with Chaney on here and Bush.
[00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:23.991]  Who else do we have here?
[00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:26.333]  Oh wow.
[00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.376]  McCain, Obama, Biden.
[00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:35.619]  Yeah, you do want to wipe your butt with these toilet paper humans.
[00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.080]  So, I don't know, do you really want me to try to FC myself?
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.580]  Hey, but seriously?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.542]  Okay, the crew's like, yeah, do it, you coward.
[00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.303]  They even brought me a second role because this one's probably going to fail.
[00:08:45.843 --> 00:08:49.285]  But seriously, guys, I actually let you guys down here.
[00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:51.466]  I forgot to report on this yesterday and again today.
[00:08:52.586 --> 00:09:01.844]   Right out of the Department of Justice, it's being reported, but They really are trying to send you a message here.
[00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:03.566]  I got hands like Ozzie Smith.
[00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.087]  Don't ever question.
[00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:07.529]  Major arrest, guys.
[00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:08.149]  Let's get serious.
[00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:15.215]  They just brought down the biggest dark web pedophile ring in world history.
[00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:17.317]  And nobody's even reporting on it.
[00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:18.478]  I didn't even report on it.
[00:09:18.598 --> 00:09:19.919]  I'm going to break the news right now.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.061]  Guys, see if you can find it.
[00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.163]  They did a dark web investigation.
[00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:27.025]  There were a bunch of South Koreans involved.
[00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:36.787]   Literally, I think the number was hundreds of thousands of child pornography that was being shared on the dark web.
[00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:40.650]  And they shut this whole group down that was doing it.
[00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.911]  They arrested individuals.
[00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:44.893]  So yeah, there's one of the stories.
[00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:48.295]  Hundreds arrested in global dark web child pornography investigation.
[00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:48.495]  337 arrests.
[00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:49.275]  You had Operation Broken Heart.
[00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:56.255]   that got announced earlier this year where they had hundreds of arrests and children rescued.
[00:09:56.255 --> 00:10:01.774]   You had a big arrest and rescue in California, a big arrest and rescue in Florida. I mean,
[00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:07.615]   this is real stuff, Leanne, that you never see it in the news. It never even was happening prior to
[00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:12.575]   the Trump administration from what I'm aware of, but it goes completely ignored.
[00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:19.176]  You know, this is something you think all of America would be behind, stopping child... There's no such thing as child porn.
[00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:19.917]  It's child rape.
[00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:26.685]  So child rape videos on the internet, the Trump administration is actually shutting this down, gets no press.
[00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:33.616]  Right, that's something I always wondered, because the media loves, they love, you know, if it bleed, it leads.
[00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.958]  That's the saying in news, and so they love that type of scandal.
[00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:46.303]  And then it's also got a feel-good ending to it, because you're stopping a lot of this child harm.
[00:10:46.403 --> 00:10:50.065]  Okay, so we've got to cut Leanne McAdoo off here.
[00:10:50.105 --> 00:10:51.366]  Guys, do we have audio of this?
[00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:53.227]  What's going on on the scene?
[00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:55.829]  Alex Jones is at the scene right now, at the Trump rally.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.241]  And there's a big Trump protest group, and I guess security is telling him he can't go through it.
[00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.842]  Or is he trying to get in the rally, and the Antifa group is keeping him from going in?
[00:11:07.562 --> 00:11:08.222]  Here's some audio.
[00:11:08.262 --> 00:11:09.423]  We may have to dump this, guys.
[00:11:09.463 --> 00:11:11.383]  Let's just go with it until we can't anymore.
[00:11:13.384 --> 00:11:14.464]  This is Will Johnson live.
[00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:15.044]  Let's go live.
[00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:18.845]  Wow, they love this man.
[00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.766]  Got his bullhorn ready to go.
[00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:27.926]  I will say the Antifa scum is light in the turnout.
[00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:30.127]  Trump 2020!
[00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:30.907]  Wake up!
[00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:34.389]  Wake up!
[00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.190]  So we're live.
[00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.110]  Alright, we gotta dump this.
[00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:37.771]  The Antifa just keeps cursing.
[00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:39.092]  They can't stop themselves.
[00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:43.715]  So we'll just keep the feed going here though.
[00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:51.640]  So Alex Jones is in Dallas at the Trump rally and immediately a group of Antifas just starts screaming and probably tried to spit on him and everything.
[00:11:52.264 --> 00:11:54.065]  Yeah, that's quite the bounty right there.
[00:11:54.085 --> 00:12:03.230]  Antifa can... Seriously though, have you... I mean, I feel bad for these guys because if they really want to be anti-fascist, it's like, I'm on board.
[00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.031]  You know?
[00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:06.332]  I'm anti-fascist, let's get behind that.
[00:12:06.372 --> 00:12:08.313]  They're not anti-fascist, they're anti-American.
[00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:08.834]  Right.
[00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:13.296]  Well, they're all showing up with, like, communist Chinese masks and things.
[00:12:13.457 --> 00:12:14.917]  It's just like, they don't even make sense.
[00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:17.239]  They don't even understand what their own mission is.
[00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:23.298]  Let's see if it looks like Alex is trying to get a microphone here or get on the bullhorn.
[00:12:25.642 --> 00:12:27.865]  He's being followed by a very large contingent.
[00:12:27.945 --> 00:12:42.765]   here let's go live now the police are on hold
[00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:54.765]   the police are on hold the police are on hold
[00:12:55.469 --> 00:12:57.911]  Nobody is going to assassinate Trump.
[00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:02.134]  Nobody is taking America's freedom.
[00:13:02.454 --> 00:13:04.336]  America is back!
[00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:06.057]  They're chanting, love Trump's hate.
[00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:08.419]  This is the most hateful group of people I've ever seen in my life.
[00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.881]  For the tyranny of the globalists.
[00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:13.403]  America is back!
[00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:14.964]  Are we okay here, guys?
[00:13:15.264 --> 00:13:16.264]  Okay, alright.
[00:13:16.264 --> 00:13:24.264]  [NOISE]
[00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:26.623]  So folks, you're watching live footage.
[00:13:26.657 --> 00:13:28.517]  We've got a crew out in Dallas.
[00:13:28.637 --> 00:13:29.638]  Alex is on the ground.
[00:13:30.138 --> 00:13:32.818]  Antifa literally foaming at the mouth as soon as they see him.
[00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:33.518]  I don't get it.
[00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:33.999]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:35.979]  Like, Alex is anti-fascist, man.
[00:13:37.239 --> 00:13:40.160]  Like, we can disagree politically, but we're not fascists.
[00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.636]  But they don't understand what fascism is.
[00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:46.917]  If this was a fascist country, those cops would be stomping their heads into the concrete.
[00:13:47.157 --> 00:13:47.377]  Right.
[00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:50.238]  Well, this is what happens when you change the meaning of words.
[00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:53.799]  And you invert reality, so it's like, opposite.
[00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.180]  That's exactly what it is, Leigh-Anne.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.600]  It's like what you guys were talking about yesterday.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:06.764]  Now, masculinity means being feminine, and femininity means chopping off your hair, growing armpit hair, and having leg hair, and being masculine.
[00:14:06.784 --> 00:14:07.784]  That's femininity now.
[00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:10.545]  Yeah, that's... And if you don't do that, you're a bigot.
[00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.392]  Things are, it's truly the upside down.
[00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:16.034]  And then it makes you crazy if you don't go along with it.
[00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:22.839]  Alright, guys, I mean, seriously, this is, these protesters just can't stop cursing.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.201]  I'm hearing nothing but F-bombs out of these people.
[00:14:26.382 --> 00:14:27.722]  Zero intellect at all.
[00:14:29.444 --> 00:14:54.613]   Now, the amazing thing about this, guys, the last time we did something like this at a Trump rally, and you can see Alex is already getting all the media attention, The last time we did something like this at a Trump rally was in Houston, and that was like when we were on our last legs of all the live broadcasting ability, because we were banned off Facebook, YouTube, and everything, and then we still had a couple accounts left on Twitter, at least I did.
[00:14:55.606 --> 00:14:59.207]  I had an InfoWarsArmy account, I had a War Room account, and I had a War Room Memes account.
[00:14:59.247 --> 00:15:03.268]  They banned the War Room account actually previously, but I had a War Room Memes and an InfoWarsArmy account.
[00:15:03.688 --> 00:15:09.230]  I went live in Houston and they banned both the accounts that day, me being live at the rally.
[00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:14.191]  So this is the content that they really want to censor the public from seeing.
[00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:22.794]  Trump with huge support, Alex Jones with huge support, and then just the rabid disgust that comes out of these Trump protesters.
[00:15:23.544 --> 00:15:30.285]  I mean, it's incredible to see how they can just completely turn the cameras around and not show you the huge crowds that are there.
[00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:34.566]  And just think that they can get away with it, that people aren't going to say, well, I was actually there.
[00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:36.106]  I have pictures of the event.
[00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:40.127]  The line is wrapped around the building for a mile.
[00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:47.648]  But they just blatantly lie to people and say Trump, you know, a majority of people polled now support his removal.
[00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.549]  And that's Fox News.
[00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:56.342]   And by the way, They do the same thing, and so many people end up being a part of the lie.
[00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:58.104]  It kind of becomes a red pill moment.
[00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:09.895]  Like the millions of people that went to Trump's inauguration, and I mean, I was there, Antifa, it's not even Antifa, it's just a bunch of losers, are blocking the entrance to get in.
[00:16:10.176 --> 00:16:14.200]  I couldn't even get in, it was literally a thousand, and they're all there for the Women's March.
[00:16:17.284 --> 00:16:18.483]  Alex live in Dallas.
[00:16:18.483 --> 00:16:22.284]  Americans are not bowing to the bully.
[00:16:22.284 --> 00:16:24.083]  America is back!
[00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.985]  America is back!
[00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.784]  America is back!
[00:16:27.784 --> 00:16:31.784]   He's in front of the American Airlines arena in Dallas, where Trump is about to give a speech.
[00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.891]  He got there quick.
[00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:40.353]  I'm surprised they were able to pull that off.
[00:16:40.552 --> 00:16:47.552]   America is back! America is back! America is back! America is back!

[00:17:37.138 --> 00:17:43.403]  Got the guy so riled up.
[00:17:43.704 --> 00:17:49.088]  Look at this guy in the background.
[00:17:49.889 --> 00:17:52.471]  This Trump hater following Alex with his sign.
[00:17:52.712 --> 00:17:53.793]  Trying to yell over him?
[00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:54.693]  Yeah.
[00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:56.976]  He's a Young Turks fan, you know it.
[00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.478]  Oh, that guy's got a bongo drum!
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.461]  They just gave up.
[00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:06.622]  I love it.
[00:18:06.642 --> 00:18:09.643]  You know, sometimes it's kind of like, it has like the community college feel.
[00:18:09.663 --> 00:18:13.605]  You know, the Trump protests, they get in the trees, they hit the hacky sack around, play the bongos.
[00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:17.046]  I remember that, walking around the college campus.
[00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:20.547]  You know, the hippies would hang out in the trees, play the bongos.
[00:18:21.588 --> 00:18:22.448]  That's kind of this crowd.
[00:18:22.888 --> 00:18:24.189]  Yeah, that's not bad, you know.
[00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:26.590]  No, you got to be one with the hacky sack.
[00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:26.890]  Yeah.
[00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:33.002]  It's nothing like what we were seeing, or was that Minneapolis?
[00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:35.123]  Oh!
[00:18:35.143 --> 00:18:36.984]  What's that guys?
[00:18:39.246 --> 00:18:40.407]  Oh, Tom Pappard is with us too.
[00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.470]  So we're just following Alex Jones live here.
[00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.231]  Not sure if he's going to make it in?
[00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:48.893]  I don't think he's going to make it in.
[00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:50.354]  I think it's already filled in there anyway.
[00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:55.737]  He might have room for one more so long as he doesn't bring his phone in.
[00:18:55.557 --> 00:18:58.557]   Yeah, they won't allow that bullhorn in there, that's for sure.
[00:18:58.557 --> 00:19:01.057]   They believe they'll openly talk about how they're going to kill Trump.
[00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.557]  They don't do no such thing.
[00:19:02.557 --> 00:19:04.557]  They're being rooted!
[00:19:04.557 --> 00:19:12.557]   Now this might be live on Will Johnson's Twitter, but again, the last days we were able to go live with Alex on Twitter
[00:19:12.557 --> 00:19:17.557]   were from the Houston Trump rally, and they shut down all of our accounts that we used to go live on after that.
[00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:26.261]  So they are, this is being broadcast live on Will Johnson's Twitter, Unite America First, and on his YouTube, Unite America First.
[00:19:27.657 --> 00:19:28.978]  They may just kick Alex off.
[00:19:28.998 --> 00:19:32.882]  They may just kick Will off because he's even daring to broadcast Alex right now.
[00:19:33.682 --> 00:19:35.964]  Even daring to film him.
[00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:37.065]  Tom Papert is with us.
[00:19:38.246 --> 00:19:38.747]  So Tom...
[00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:41.521]  Alex Jones is in Dallas.
[00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:54.076]  The bongo-playing, tree-hugging, hippie protesters are out there and they're really upset that Trump isn't dead yet and that Trump is more popular than ever.
[00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:59.023]  So, Tom, give us your analysis as we move closer to Trump going live.
[00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:02.779]  Well, it's a fascinating crowd outside, Owen.
[00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:16.226]  You were talking earlier that it looks like some of the crazies might not be in attendance tonight, but it really seems like they were waiting for Alex Jones to get there and then follow him around like flies on you-know-what.
[00:20:16.687 --> 00:20:20.329]  So it's fascinating to kind of see that happen, but of course you're used to it.
[00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:23.590]  You see the flies go to Alex Jones every single time he walks outside.
[00:20:25.031 --> 00:20:28.653]  I do think it's fascinating that this is happening in Dallas, Texas.
[00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:33.035]  And of course, we've talked about the symbology on Infowars and Bandai Video all day.
[00:20:33.395 --> 00:20:37.077]  Of course, it's not a great place for presidents, if you ask JFK.
[00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:41.399]  But I think President Trump has a loyal team of security.
[00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:42.819]  I'm cautiously optimistic.
[00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:46.721]  However, I'm very encouraged to see Alex on the ground there.
[00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:52.704]  Should anything terrible happen, we're going to have somebody we all can trust reporting live on scene.
[00:20:54.779 --> 00:21:03.166]  What do you make about how, I mean, because I feel like at this point, the protesters, the Trump protesters have just consciously accepted fake news.
[00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:09.532]  You know, like they know all the stuff that's being said about Trump, reported about Trump and supporters is fake, but they don't care.
[00:21:10.112 --> 00:21:11.934]  You know, they thrive off the hatred.
[00:21:12.735 --> 00:21:14.316]  They thrive off the faux drama.
[00:21:15.157 --> 00:21:16.238]  And so they kind of get off.
[00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:19.601]  It's kind of like, oh, here's like, here's my boogeyman, Alex Jones.
[00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:20.422]  Yeah.
[00:21:22.887 --> 00:21:24.609]  No, I think you're right about that, Owen.
[00:21:24.649 --> 00:21:25.630]  They need enemies.
[00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.194]  And the fact is, I mean, all of the actually evil people are on their side.
[00:21:30.234 --> 00:21:35.740]  You have Hillary Clinton, where even if you take all the stuff that we know, just throw all of that out the window.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.284]  The horrible things she did with her husband for African Americans, throwing them in prison.
[00:21:40.324 --> 00:21:42.747]  Just the things that are on the record that she's done.
[00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:44.888]  Yeah, look at the other wonderful people they have.
[00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:53.513]  They have Mr. Segregation himself, Joe Biden, who bragged about trying to lynch a black guy in the 70s or 50s or however old that dinosaur is.
[00:21:53.873 --> 00:21:56.495]  They have all of the terrible, terrible people.
[00:21:56.795 --> 00:22:01.458]  You have George Soros, who looks like he has men's private parts under his eyes.
[00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:07.201]  You have all of these disgusting people on the left and meanwhile on the right we have Alex Jones who is full of energy and life.
[00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:11.023]  We have President Trump who is out there trying to fight these scum in the Oval Office.
[00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:12.644]  We've got Infowars.
[00:22:12.904 --> 00:22:14.265]  We've got Bandop Video.
[00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:15.586]  We have all phenomenal people.
[00:22:15.606 --> 00:22:18.728]  So yeah, I mean they have to swallow their own propaganda.
[00:22:19.148 --> 00:22:47.993]   And I think the reason why you look at these people, and their skin is green, clammy, sickly, they just scream at the top of their lungs, obscenities, as we saw earlier, they're screaming, love Trump's hate, and you know, if it wasn't for the five security guards and all the police around, they would descend on Alex Jones like hyenas, and probably start ripping off limbs, so these people are... Well, yeah, I think they would probably get around him, and then once they, you know, Actually saw him in the flesh.
[00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:54.345]  They might kind of be like whoa, okay I'm not really ready for this fight, but you know Here's another thing too.
[00:22:54.425 --> 00:22:59.929]   We're gonna rewind this and and show you the video guys Alright, alright.
[00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:00.449]  Hold up, guys.
[00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:00.729]  Hold up.
[00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:00.989]  Hold up.
[00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.350]  Rewind it.
[00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.650]  Rewind it.
[00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.911]  You gotta let me know when we're gonna do this.
[00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:04.031]  So here's the deal.
[00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:06.613]  Alex Jones arrives in Dallas.
[00:23:07.134 --> 00:23:08.154]  Antifa's on the ground.
[00:23:08.394 --> 00:23:10.876]  First of all, Alex arrived in a battle tank.
[00:23:11.316 --> 00:23:14.278]  I don't know where he got access to a frickin' battle tank!
[00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:22.444]  Alex Jones literally pulls up to the Trump rally in a battle tank and goes right into the Antifa thug clan and here's the video.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.240]  America is back.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.240]  America is back.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.240]  And President Trump is stronger than ever.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   Standing against the globalist traitors that have been trying to sell our nation out.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.240]  Mr. Jones, why are you here?
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.240]  Mr. Jones, why are you here?
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   I'm here because the deep state, people like Bill Mudd, the CIA,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.240]  have said they're going to kill President Trump.
[00:23:51.067 --> 00:24:03.257]  So we're here to draw attention to the rogue, criminal, leftist government that tried to sell us out to China, and the fact that they're not going to repeat what they did to Kennedy 56 years ago here in Dallas.
[00:24:03.437 --> 00:24:07.501]  Let the American people know who the Deep State is!
[00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:09.723]  Yeah, Phil Mudd said the government's going to kill this guy.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.561]  Do you have any proof of that?
[00:24:13.741 --> 00:24:14.842]  Yeah, they said it, jackass!
[00:24:15.102 --> 00:24:16.924]  They've all been talking about how they're gonna remove him.
[00:24:17.484 --> 00:24:18.825]  One way or another, so yes.
[00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:20.947]  So no proof, just talk.
[00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:22.949]  So no proof, he just said it.
[00:24:22.989 --> 00:24:24.870]  The proof will be when he's killed.
[00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:25.731]  Then there's proof.
[00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:29.334]  Phil Mudge said, we're gonna stab him in the back with a shiv.
[00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:30.735]  That's a direct quote.
[00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:31.676]  Let's get that clip, guys.
[00:24:31.716 --> 00:24:32.457]  Let's go back to Alex.
[00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:34.797]  [crowd noise]
[00:24:34.797 --> 00:24:36.797]  [radio chatter]
[00:24:36.797 --> 00:24:38.797]  [radio chatter]
[00:24:38.797 --> 00:24:40.797]  This guy doing the devil horns.
[00:24:40.797 --> 00:24:42.797]  [radio chatter]
[00:24:42.797 --> 00:24:44.797]  [radio chatter]
[00:24:44.797 --> 00:24:46.797]  [radio chatter]
[00:24:46.552 --> 00:24:49.236]  I think it's rock and roll.
[00:24:49.276 --> 00:24:50.939]  I think it's rock and roll.
[00:24:50.778 --> 00:24:55.117]   and more that's what i'm thinking i think it's rock and roll he is
[00:24:55.117 --> 00:24:56.818]   rock and roll we'll go with that
[00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.057]  america is back!
[00:24:59.057 --> 00:25:01.057]  america is back!
[00:25:01.057 --> 00:25:02.057]  America is back!
[00:25:02.057 --> 00:25:03.058]  America is back!
[00:25:03.058 --> 00:25:04.058]  America is back!
[00:25:04.058 --> 00:25:05.058]  America is back!
[00:25:05.406 --> 00:25:06.587]  America's back!
[00:25:07.108 --> 00:25:08.709]  Look at that mainstream media weasel.
[00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:09.810]  Everybody hates him.
[00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.231]  Everybody knows there's liars.
[00:25:12.252 --> 00:25:15.235]  Phil Mudd didn't say the government was going to kill Trump.
[00:25:15.955 --> 00:25:18.698]  He just said we made that up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:21.180]  Think about the level of the fraud.
[00:25:22.561 --> 00:25:24.302]  InfoWars.com.
[00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:27.965]  Alex Jones is mobilizing in a battle tank.
[00:25:29.488 --> 00:25:30.649]  I can't wait to see the memes.
[00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.892]  Jones is going to want that.
[00:25:34.932 --> 00:25:35.592]  He's like, hey.
[00:25:36.092 --> 00:25:38.734]  Yeah, yeah, that's going to pull up to InfoWars Studios tomorrow.
[00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:40.956]  Let me take this off your hands for you.
[00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:43.698]  I think he's about, so wait, does he get out of the vehicle next, guys?
[00:25:44.678 --> 00:25:45.919]  And then approaches him on foot?
[00:25:48.241 --> 00:25:50.402]  All right, all right, so let's, let's just hold it right there.
[00:25:50.462 --> 00:25:51.082]  We'll come back.
[00:25:51.102 --> 00:25:52.023]  We're about to take a break here.
[00:25:52.043 --> 00:25:53.204]  We'll come back with that footage.
[00:25:53.924 --> 00:25:57.627]  But, you know, Leanne, you brought up the Trump rally in Minnesota a minute ago.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:06.926]  I mean, it's pretty much... I mean, I guess you can't say totally confirmed, but it's pretty much... I mean, it looks pretty solid.
[00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:17.193]  Ilhan Omar was out there at the protest in Minnesota engaging in terrorism and riots in the street with her little bigelow who she cheated on her husband with.
[00:26:17.914 --> 00:26:18.754]  They ended up getting a divorce.
[00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:22.297]  Of course, they were never actually married, so there's that whole fiasco.
[00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:27.821]  But did you see Ilhan Omar or Ilhan Omar's doppelganger engaging in terrorism in Minnesota?
[00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:30.202]  I saw her doppelganger.
[00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:34.563]  And by the way, there's audio where the guy says, oh, I'm here protecting a state representative.
[00:26:35.124 --> 00:26:36.964]  Yeah, I didn't see that.
[00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:39.545]  I mean, was she out there with Antifa?
[00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:41.306]  Like, with her sticks and stuff?
[00:26:41.626 --> 00:26:42.686]  Well, because here's the thing.
[00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:43.066]  No, no, no.
[00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:48.728]  But Ilhan Omar, you know, fake Muslim, she doesn't wear the full headdress.
[00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:49.909]  So she doesn't cover her face.
[00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:53.290]  So she can't even make the excuse, oh, I was out there covering my face because I'm Islamic.
[00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.171]  No, you never cover your face.
[00:26:56.007 --> 00:27:00.209]  So, unless it's the Ilhan Omar doppelganger-like extreme.
[00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.610]  Tom, did you see this?
[00:27:02.751 --> 00:27:03.271]  I did.
[00:27:03.351 --> 00:27:05.112]  We reported on it, as did Infowars.
[00:27:05.132 --> 00:27:09.935]  We reported on it at nationalfile.com, and it certainly looks a lot like her.
[00:27:10.115 --> 00:27:14.257]  I mean, you know, Owen, what they're going to do is they're going to come back and call us racist.
[00:27:14.317 --> 00:27:16.138]  Apparently, we think all Muslims look like this.
[00:27:16.158 --> 00:27:16.739]  Oh, I don't care anymore.
[00:27:16.779 --> 00:27:17.619]  I'm done with it.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.420]  Me too.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.782]  I mean, frankly, it certainly looks like her.
[00:27:22.143 --> 00:27:31.610]  This is a woman who is rabidly anti-Trump and her fellow squad member, of course, was saying, we're going to impeach this mother effer when she was inaugurated.
[00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:36.153]  So it certainly wouldn't surprise me if later on, I don't know how it can be confirmed.
[00:27:36.213 --> 00:27:40.737]  I encourage all citizen journalists to get on the case to confirm whether or not that was her.
[00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:42.558]  It certainly looked like her.
[00:27:42.638 --> 00:27:45.641]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of that.
[00:27:46.101 --> 00:27:47.141]  Well, she'll never admit it.
[00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:49.202]  I mean, you could be like, hey, what were you doing that night?
[00:27:49.282 --> 00:27:51.343]  She'll probably say she was with her husband.
[00:27:52.324 --> 00:27:53.204]  But we know that's a lie.
[00:27:53.224 --> 00:27:54.745]  They haven't been together for a long time.
[00:27:54.985 --> 00:27:56.066]  Or maybe it was her brother.
[00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:57.706]  Or her brother-husband.
[00:27:58.126 --> 00:28:01.148]  Or her campaign manager-husband-brother-lover.
[00:28:01.168 --> 00:28:03.409]  I can't keep track anymore.
[00:28:05.422 --> 00:28:11.945]  She, you know, I'm sure a lot of the fans, a lot of the viewers are aware of a very popular series, Game of Thrones.
[00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:14.186]  We have the Cersei Lannister of Minnesota now.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:18.767]  She allegedly married her brother, divorced her brother to get another guy and now she's divorced.
[00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:19.748]  Oh, it's not allegedly?
[00:28:19.768 --> 00:28:20.108]  I mean, come on!
[00:28:20.128 --> 00:28:22.569]  She's pictured with... And then she deletes all the evidence too.
[00:28:23.646 --> 00:28:24.906]  Hey, good for Ilhan Omar!
[00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:26.047]  No, hey, good for Ilhan Omar!
[00:28:26.087 --> 00:28:27.027]  She's a real badass.
[00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:30.008]  She's a real badass engaging in terrorism with Antifa out there.
[00:28:30.348 --> 00:28:32.308]  If it's her, I'm sure it's not actually.
[00:28:32.328 --> 00:28:32.588]  You know what?
[00:28:32.648 --> 00:28:33.869]  Ilhan Omar's a loving soul.
[00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:34.629]  How dare I?
[00:28:35.209 --> 00:28:36.169]  She's the best.
[00:28:36.229 --> 00:28:37.310]  She's really good for America.
[00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.330]  Alright, we gotta take a break.
[00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.270]  Folks, don't go anywhere.
[00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.371]  Do not go anywhere.
[00:28:41.511 --> 00:28:43.351]  I'm only gonna let you go one place during this break.
[00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:44.552]  That's Infowarsstore.com.
[00:28:44.692 --> 00:28:45.172]  Nowhere else.
[00:28:45.192 --> 00:28:47.192]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.152]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:50.152 --> 00:29:07.951]   Well, I have to be honest, ladies and gentlemen, I am a lot better off than I was for the first segment
[00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:14.632]   because I now have a cup of a freshly brewed pot of the Wake Up America Patriot Blend
[00:29:14.632 --> 00:29:19.979]   coffee from InfoWarstore.com So, Leanne, I'm going to sip on this coffee for a minute, get myself right.
[00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:21.600]  What's on your mind right now?
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.543]  Well, I'm just, you know, it's interesting to me how... Mmm, this coffee's so good from InfoWarsTore.com!
[00:29:27.643 --> 00:29:28.023]  Oh, sorry.
[00:29:29.404 --> 00:29:30.085]  We are...
[00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:39.936]  Just kind of doing everything we can here, especially Bandot video and all these other ways of setting it up so that we have a voice in this country.
[00:29:41.557 --> 00:29:46.821]  But when you look around, you see Jimmy Kimmel, he's basically a Democratic PR person.
[00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:54.447]  And he uses his late night comedy show to run interference for the Democrats and talking about Hunter Biden.
[00:29:54.467 --> 00:30:00.464]   It seems like every single outlet They have working for them, in cahoots with them.
[00:30:00.664 --> 00:30:09.912]  So how are people going to, this election cycle, get the information that kind of counters the CNN tales?
[00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:13.595]  Well, I remember- Even Fox News just bought up by Disney, of course.
[00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:21.781]  So that's why we're seeing such a switch in Fox News, bringing people on like Donna Brazile and others where you're just thinking, whoa, what?
[00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:23.783]  Wait, Fox News was bought by Walt Pedophile?
[00:30:23.883 --> 00:30:24.663]  I mean, Walt Disney?
[00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:25.044]  Right.
[00:30:25.584 --> 00:30:42.289]  That's why you're seeing such a massive change in some of their programming and and just the ways that they cover things and and yeah it's so it's everywhere you look the leftists are taking over what the information people have access to.
[00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:49.096]   Well back in 2016 before Trump was elected I mean, we worked together every day.
[00:30:49.136 --> 00:30:51.197]  I remember we would do reports on YouTube.
[00:30:51.498 --> 00:30:52.158]  It was kind of a joke.
[00:30:52.178 --> 00:31:01.425]  I mean, it was friendly competition, but it would be like, okay, we put up a report on YouTube, it averaged about 20,000 views, and we'd kind of look the next day and be like, ooh, whose report got, you know, more views?
[00:31:01.725 --> 00:31:06.469]  It would be like, who had a better thumbnail or who had a better title or who's, what news was, you know, more...
[00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.829]  I guess interesting to people.
[00:31:08.829 --> 00:31:10.110]  And so we kind of measured it that way.
[00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.950]  If we got lucky, we'd hit 100,000.
[00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.109]  If it was really viral, it'd go over a million.
[00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:17.069]  And that's just been totally cut off from YouTube.
[00:31:17.069 --> 00:31:19.950]  And that was so huge during the election, I think.
[00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.950]  Right, they're even now going after meme accounts.
[00:31:23.309 --> 00:31:23.389]  Yeah.
[00:31:23.409 --> 00:31:24.849]  Because the memes are so effective.
[00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:25.870]  Or parody accounts.
[00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.391]  Like, you can't even have a fake account.
[00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:27.851]  Right.
[00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:31.273]  You can't even say, okay, this is a fake Elizabeth Warren account.
[00:31:31.353 --> 00:31:31.953]  Nope, you're banned.
[00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:39.617]  Because some of the things that come out of their mouths are just so unbelievable anyway that those parody accounts seem like they could be the real thing.
[00:31:40.517 --> 00:31:44.599]  We're about to have Trump live right now, and so we're monitoring that.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.081]  But first, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:48.241 --> 00:31:49.122]  Is it ready to go, guys?
[00:31:51.425 --> 00:31:58.991]  Alex Jones got out of his battle tank and then went boots on the ground and approached the Antifa slovenly mobs.
[00:31:59.031 --> 00:32:01.853]  They put down the hacky sack and the bongos, climbed out of the trees.
[00:32:02.114 --> 00:32:02.714]  Here's how it went.
[00:32:03.335 --> 00:32:07.178]  Which path he wants to take through, try to avoid the violent people.
[00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:12.961]  Listen to the low energy zombies.
[00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:20.961]  [Chanting]
[00:32:20.961 --> 00:32:23.961]  Literally sounds like a mob of zombies.
[00:32:23.961 --> 00:32:25.961]  [Groaning]
[00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:27.927]  Brains!
[00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.208]  Brains!
[00:32:32.529 --> 00:32:36.612]  And then... Did they realize it's Alex Jones?
[00:32:36.632 --> 00:32:37.512]  They just figured it out.
[00:32:37.612 --> 00:32:40.014]  Right into the fire, that one.
[00:32:40.074 --> 00:32:40.934]  We can't go that way.
[00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:41.755]  We can't go that way.
[00:32:41.615 --> 00:32:51.134]   right into the fire that one. We can't go that way. We can't go that way.
[00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:57.534]  Yeah this is what Antifa does.
[00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:58.604]  They block you from going to an event and then they say, oh look, no one was there.
[00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:04.594]  All the cameras are only looking at the protesters like, see, no one supports Trump.
[00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:05.455]  The polls are right.
[00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:10.353]  Boy, the demons really come out, don't they?
[00:33:10.653 --> 00:33:11.534]  No more Trump.
[00:33:11.814 --> 00:33:13.895]  I bet that sign's gonna finally do it for good.
[00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:15.496]  Oh, she's got a whistleblower, too.
[00:33:15.536 --> 00:33:16.357]  She's a whistleblower.
[00:33:16.377 --> 00:33:18.939]  Did you see the new whistleblower technology the Democrats have?
[00:33:18.979 --> 00:33:19.479]  It's amazing.
[00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:22.001]  I love how the whistleblowers matter all of a sudden.
[00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:26.684]  Not like President Obama didn't... Oh, oh, oh my gosh, by the way.
[00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:27.664]  Oh my gosh.
[00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:29.225]  This is such big news.
[00:33:29.245 --> 00:33:30.586]  I didn't even... I forgot to cover it today.
[00:33:31.127 --> 00:33:32.587]  And Tom, you may be on this, too.
[00:33:33.108 --> 00:33:34.629]  Tom, you know who Michael Atkinson is?
[00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:39.889]   I'm vaguely aware, but I think you're scooping me on this one, Owen.
[00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:44.449]   No, I bet you guys, you're probably like me where we started to get into it and then just
[00:33:44.449 --> 00:33:45.689]  all these distractions came.
[00:33:45.689 --> 00:33:47.248]  Michael Atkinson is a big name.
[00:33:47.248 --> 00:33:50.049]  Now, it's kind of a mystery right now.
[00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:53.529]  Oh my gosh, I did such a deep dive on Atkinson yesterday.
[00:33:53.529 --> 00:33:55.408]  Hold on a second while I go through the memory bank.
[00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:58.608]  So Atkinson worked during the Bush years, I believe.
[00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:00.250]  Definitely during the Obama years.
[00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:04.874]  Trump appointed him in, I believe it was November of 2017.
[00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:11.338]  And now he's the Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee or something like that.
[00:34:11.898 --> 00:34:15.841]  And so this is the guy who's handling all the whistleblower complaints.
[00:34:16.342 --> 00:34:18.183]  And then I went and I looked at Atkinson.
[00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:26.870]   When he took over that department, he said, oh, I'm going to clear out all the rot gut and we're really going to get down to these whistleblowers.
[00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:32.575]  Oh, and now conveniently all of a sudden all the whistleblowers come forward against Trump and he's there amplifying it.
[00:34:33.136 --> 00:34:37.620]  And this is a Trump appointee from the Obama, and I think Bush too, I'm not positive about that.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.521]  I'd have to double check that.
[00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:46.648]  Atkinson, Michael Atkinson, this guy is either major deep state helping shift with these BS whistleblowers.
[00:34:47.749 --> 00:34:51.151]  Or, he's flipped on the deep state and is helping Trump.
[00:34:51.832 --> 00:34:54.954]  I'm kind of in between right now, but leaning towards he's a deep stater.
[00:34:55.614 --> 00:34:58.816]  But Tom, I don't know if you guys on the national file have done much to look into this guy.
[00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:00.877]  Yes, we have actually.
[00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:02.699]  Now, this is the guy who changed the rules.
[00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:05.700]  So now you can have third people here say if you want to call the whistleblower.
[00:35:06.977 --> 00:35:18.450]  Yes, so he is, I mean, for my, look, okay, so... So wait a second, so actually, let's call Michael Atkinson right now, I'm a whistleblower, I'm gonna blow the whistle on Obama right now, because he changed the rules, he don't need anything, I mean, I'll just make it up.
[00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:22.415]  I'll take a dump here on the stage and say, look, Atkinson, it's a whistleblower.
[00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:26.640]  I'll put a whistle on the steaming pile of crap, and it'll be more credible than Adam Schiff.
[00:35:27.944 --> 00:35:38.434]  Well, and oh, and so I think if you remember, everybody remembers this, Bannon came out and said that it was the original sin of the Trump administration to try to work with the existing deep staters.
[00:35:38.474 --> 00:35:40.817]  They thought that they could win these people over and persuade them.
[00:35:41.137 --> 00:35:41.978]  And that was happening.
[00:35:42.018 --> 00:35:43.279]  This is what that guy came from.
[00:35:43.399 --> 00:35:51.185]  This is the era that this guy was brought into the Trump administration when they were still thinking, maybe we can make a deal, maybe they're not all objectively evil.
[00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:52.086]  But now we know.
[00:35:52.146 --> 00:35:57.450]  I mean, we've had, what, two, three whistleblowers that are all completely unsubstantiated, so they can try to impeach him.
[00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.232]  I mean, it's obvious to anybody paying attention, this guy is no good.
[00:36:01.273 --> 00:36:08.378]  But again, it just goes to show, Owen, and you know this better than anybody, this administration is rife with people who want to see the president fail.
[00:36:08.698 --> 00:36:10.419]  And we wonder why things go so slow.
[00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:12.621]  We wonder why the wall is only like a third of the way done.
[00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:14.022]  Because of people like this.
[00:36:14.122 --> 00:36:25.371]  This is now going to give the Democrats, this one guy, making this one decision is going to give the Democrats all the ammunition they need to make sure nothing happens in Congress all the way up through November of 2020.
[00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:32.355]  And this whole whistleblower thing, now they're saying, oh, Fiona Hill is the second whistleblower.
[00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:38.001]  No, Fiona Hill, first of all, is probably a scarecrow here.
[00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:40.603]  I don't even know if there was ever a real whistleblower.
[00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:41.424]  It may have been Adam Schiff.
[00:36:41.464 --> 00:36:42.425]  It may have been John Brennan.
[00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:44.087]  It may have been John Bolton.
[00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:45.548]  Whoever it was, it's irrelevant.
[00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:47.590]  They're now claiming, oh, it was Fiona Hill.
[00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:49.452]  That's the second whistleblower.
[00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:50.172]  But wait a second.
[00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:59.259]  The second whistleblower is technically the first whistleblower is the original whistleblower because it was secondhand, thirdhand information that came from the original source.
[00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:00.419]  So was it Fiona Hill?
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.680]  Was it somebody else?
[00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:03.481]  It's all being made up.
[00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:04.622]  They're changing the rules.
[00:37:05.403 --> 00:37:13.512]   And then if you're inside and you're one of these people, you think, oh, If I'm the whistleblower that brings Trump down, I'll get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:37:13.892 --> 00:37:15.933]  I'll be rewarded on CNN.
[00:37:15.953 --> 00:37:18.593]  Ah, I'll get FaceTime on MSNBC.
[00:37:19.214 --> 00:37:20.834]  Phil Mudd will give me a reach around.
[00:37:21.094 --> 00:37:21.954]  Michelle Obama.
[00:37:22.274 --> 00:37:23.255]  Okay, I'll stop right there.
[00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.595]  But that's pretty much where we're going.
[00:37:25.955 --> 00:37:29.376]  We've got an eye on the Trump podium right now.
[00:37:29.937 --> 00:37:32.517]  The crowd looks like it's a little rambunctious right now.
[00:37:32.597 --> 00:37:34.458]  Guys, is Trump about to come out?
[00:37:34.498 --> 00:37:35.158]  Is that what's going on?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.441]  Just the crowd is getting a little rambunctious there.
[00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:42.181]  Okay, we're going to continue to monitor this.
[00:37:43.241 --> 00:37:44.642]  A full house in Dallas.
[00:37:44.942 --> 00:37:46.302]  Tom, were you saying something?
[00:37:47.362 --> 00:37:52.363]  Well, so I know we're talking about this whistleblowing situation, but Owen, I'm still just baffled.
[00:37:52.443 --> 00:37:54.164]  Where did Alex Jones get a battle tank?
[00:37:57.124 --> 00:37:57.424]  Leanne?
[00:37:57.604 --> 00:38:01.045]  I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure he owns that now.
[00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:02.085]  Alright.
[00:38:02.205 --> 00:38:03.786]  Whoever that is not getting it back.
[00:38:04.026 --> 00:38:05.266]  Alright, here's the scoop.
[00:38:06.644 --> 00:38:08.846]  Alex Jones raided a U.N.
[00:38:08.946 --> 00:38:12.589]  stronghold in Dallas and stole and repainted one of their battle tanks.
[00:38:12.629 --> 00:38:13.489]  That's actually a U.N.
[00:38:13.529 --> 00:38:13.990]  battle tank.
[00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.411]  All right, I think Trump is coming out right now.
[00:38:16.632 --> 00:38:17.792]  The cameras are out.
[00:38:18.073 --> 00:38:20.474]  The crowd is going absolutely crazy.
[00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:23.036]  Trump has just tweeted that he's about to take the podium.
[00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:25.258]  Let's go live, guys.
[00:38:25.298 --> 00:38:26.579]  Give me audio if you can, please.
[00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:27.700]  Oh, there we go.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.600]  All right.
[00:38:29.121 --> 00:38:29.381]  There he is.
[00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:33.004]  Trump has just emerged and is walking up to the stage right now.
[00:38:34.996 --> 00:38:43.705]  The Golden Toad.
[00:38:44.085 --> 00:38:45.426]  We won't put Leigh-Anne on crying.
[00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.152]  Trump's been awfully busy today.
[00:38:52.072 --> 00:38:53.354]  This guy has incredible energy.
[00:38:53.374 --> 00:38:54.194]  You gotta give him credit.
[00:38:54.234 --> 00:38:55.676]  He has to take turbo force.
[00:38:59.312 --> 00:39:02.032]  Seriously, if I'm his age and I have that energy, I'll be happy.
[00:39:02.052 --> 00:39:07.253]  No, you see all the other presidents, they seem to rapidly age when they get into... Oh yeah.
[00:39:07.293 --> 00:39:08.334]  He actually looks great.
[00:39:08.374 --> 00:39:11.334]  He's looking younger, more... He really hasn't aged.
[00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:12.874]  That is one thing I've noticed.
[00:39:12.894 --> 00:39:20.296]  I mean, by this point in the Obama administration, Obama was already gray-haired and wrinkled, and then President Trump looks like he's still, you know, maybe 55.
[00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:21.916]  Wait, guys.
[00:39:22.816 --> 00:39:25.737]  As President Trump takes the stage, we have a brand new whistleblower.
[00:39:26.117 --> 00:39:27.237]  Can we get a dot-cam here?
[00:39:28.786 --> 00:39:32.870]  Folks, this is a brand new whistleblower coming forward right now exclusively to InfoWars.
[00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.213]  We're going to get Michael Atkinson on this immediately.
[00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:37.594]  We're going to call Adam Schiff.
[00:39:38.135 --> 00:39:38.895]  No, this is huge.
[00:39:39.736 --> 00:39:40.397]  Oh my gosh.
[00:39:40.917 --> 00:39:41.498]  Oh my gosh.
[00:39:41.778 --> 00:39:42.018]  Adam.
[00:39:42.519 --> 00:39:44.240]  Adam Schiff, we have your new whistleblower.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.183]  This is going to surely destroy Trump before he takes the podium tonight.
[00:39:47.503 --> 00:39:49.525]  Michael Atkinson, we found your whistleblower.
[00:39:49.965 --> 00:39:51.307]  It's Fiona Hill's dropping.
[00:39:52.705 --> 00:40:00.514]  So there you go folks, this is the new whistleblower confirmed by Michael Atkinson and then made up facts by Adam Schiff.
[00:40:00.534 --> 00:40:02.055]  So there you go, surely that's the end of Trump.
[00:40:02.436 --> 00:40:04.438]  The latest Democrat whistleblowing technology.
[00:40:04.878 --> 00:40:06.200]  A steaming pile of crap.
[00:40:06.961 --> 00:40:09.263]  Quite literally, that's what the whistleblowers are.
[00:40:09.383 --> 00:40:11.105]  Okay, so Trump is about to take the stage.
[00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:12.687]  Leanne, any comments before he goes live?
[00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:21.475]  No, I just am so glad that that poo is being recycled, because that's what used to travel around the office trying to... That's a fresh whistleblower.
[00:40:21.515 --> 00:40:23.397]  How dare you act like that whistleblower is it new?
[00:40:23.737 --> 00:40:25.278]  Tom, anything before Trump goes live?
[00:40:26.158 --> 00:40:28.260]  Well, frankly, I don't see how Trump can go live.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.544]  That whistleblower, what he said, was absolutely damning, and I think President Trump is going to resign any moment now.
[00:40:33.884 --> 00:40:34.284]  Hold on.
[00:40:34.785 --> 00:40:36.006]  I think it's- Hold on, the whistleblower.
[00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:36.626]  Give me a dot-cam.
[00:40:36.646 --> 00:40:37.827]  The whistleblower wants to speak.
[00:40:37.967 --> 00:40:39.949]  Can I please get a dot-cam before Trump goes live?
[00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:41.310]  Trump is bad.
[00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.131]  Trump is racist.
[00:40:42.591 --> 00:40:43.151]  It's confirmed.
[00:40:43.632 --> 00:40:44.633]  Oh, that's it, folks.
[00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:45.833]  Cancel the Trump rally.
[00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:47.215]  Shut down the broadcast.
[00:40:47.235 --> 00:40:48.175]  Impeachment.
[00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:48.576]  Alright.
[00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:49.777]  That's it.
[00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:51.418]  Trump's going live.
[00:40:52.379 --> 00:40:55.061]  There are the- It's raucous in there.
[00:40:57.039 --> 00:41:03.282]  What is it, 42% of Americans who do not want the president impeached according to the latest CNN polls?
[00:41:03.642 --> 00:41:07.684]  I haven't heard the American Airlines that loud since the Blues mopped up the Dallas Stars.
[00:41:08.264 --> 00:41:08.925]  Oh, oops, sorry.
[00:41:08.945 --> 00:41:13.947]  Alright, let's go full audio.
[00:41:14.888 --> 00:41:16.128]  It's a raucous crowd in there.
[00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:23.312]  I mean, these people are so excited to be a part of this.
[00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:26.505]  Honestly, I've been to a lot of events.
[00:41:26.885 --> 00:41:28.686]  I like to experience human events like this.
[00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:30.687]  There is no energy.
[00:41:30.907 --> 00:41:36.190]  Seriously, it's like a playoff World Series game, Stanley Cup hockey game, Trump rally.
[00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.851]  That's the top energy right there.
[00:41:38.311 --> 00:41:43.314]  Hillary had to hijack a Beyonce concert or a LeBron James.
[00:41:43.354 --> 00:41:45.995]  Alright, let's try to... Just turn my mic off.
[00:41:46.015 --> 00:41:46.515]  Trump's live.
[00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:53.335]  where we just opened a beautiful new Louis Vuitton plant.
[00:41:53.335 --> 00:42:04.056]   But I'm with the freedom-loving patriots of the Lone Star State.
[00:42:04.336 --> 00:42:11.078]  I love it.
[00:42:11.138 --> 00:42:15.459]  There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:22.821]  And there's never been a better time to be a proud American.
[00:42:22.861 --> 00:42:23.702]  There never has.
[00:42:24.222 --> 00:42:30.662]  Never have.
[00:42:30.662 --> 00:42:41.182]   So I came from a small town, Alvarado, Texas, where we celebrated the incredible revival
[00:42:41.182 --> 00:42:46.581]   of American manufacturing, and we opened up some beautiful places.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.682]  I'll tell you, this place is doing great.
[00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:55.647]  And created, in a very short period of time, an extra 1,000 jobs for Texas.
[00:43:00.638 --> 00:43:12.426]  Since my election, we've created 775,000 new jobs across your state, including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs.
[00:43:12.926 --> 00:43:15.608]  They said those jobs had disappeared, didn't they?
[00:43:15.668 --> 00:43:15.968]  Huh?
[00:43:16.048 --> 00:43:16.669]  Hey, man!
[00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:24.834]  Our country is once again living by two simple rules.
[00:43:25.155 --> 00:43:35.834]  Buy American and hire American.
[00:43:35.834 --> 00:43:42.354]   The economy is booming, our people are prospering, our country is thriving, and our nation is
[00:43:42.354 --> 00:43:45.194]  stronger than ever before.
[00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:50.034]  [Applause]
[00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:56.626]  But the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become.
[00:44:00.048 --> 00:44:01.329]  Crazy.
[00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:02.110]  They're crazy.
[00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:05.272]  They're crazy.
[00:44:08.186 --> 00:44:14.730]  At stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself.
[00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:15.771]  Don't kid yourself.
[00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:17.392]  That's what they want.
[00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:21.754]  They are destroying this country, but we will never let it happen.
[00:44:21.794 --> 00:44:22.475]  Not even close.
[00:44:26.718 --> 00:44:35.820]  For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.821]  Maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.
[00:44:45.982 --> 00:44:48.323]  And they want to impose an extreme agenda.
[00:44:50.114 --> 00:44:54.275]  They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box.
[00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:55.096]  They're not going to win.
[00:44:55.116 --> 00:44:57.657]  They're not even going to... They won't come close in 2020.
[00:44:57.717 --> 00:44:58.377]  They know it.
[00:44:58.417 --> 00:44:58.997]  They know it.
[00:44:59.017 --> 00:45:02.839]  They're not going to win it.
[00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:05.800]  They say, let's see.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.300]  What's another idea?
[00:45:09.161 --> 00:45:10.741]  What's another idea?
[00:45:10.881 --> 00:45:12.362]  How do we win this election?
[00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:19.720]  You know, I really don't believe anymore that they love our country.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:20.820]  I don't believe it.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.100]  One more year!
[00:45:25.063 --> 00:45:25.323]  One more year!
[00:45:26.463 --> 00:45:26.723]  One more year!
[00:45:27.304 --> 00:45:27.684]  One more year!
[00:45:28.264 --> 00:45:28.524]  One more year!
[00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:29.485]  One more year!
[00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:30.325]  One more year!
[00:45:31.106 --> 00:45:31.366]  One more year!
[00:45:32.006 --> 00:45:32.266]  One more year!
[00:45:33.027 --> 00:45:33.287]  One more year!
[00:45:33.887 --> 00:45:34.147]  One more year!
[00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:35.028]  One more year!
[00:45:35.728 --> 00:45:36.008]  One more year!
[00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:37.789]  One more year!
[00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:40.211]  One more year!
[00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:41.471]  One more year!
[00:45:42.132 --> 00:45:42.392]  One more year!
[00:45:42.412 --> 00:45:42.672]  One more year!
[00:45:42.692 --> 00:45:48.230]   One more year And Shifty Schiff, how about this guy?
[00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.932]  How about this guy?
[00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:56.979]  He makes up my conversation, which was perfect.
[00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:59.501]  He makes up my conversation.
[00:45:59.921 --> 00:46:01.323]  He sees what I said.
[00:46:02.124 --> 00:46:04.486]  It doesn't play well because it was perfect.
[00:46:04.866 --> 00:46:10.372]  So he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president.
[00:46:15.345 --> 00:46:16.667]  And we caught him cold.
[00:46:17.989 --> 00:46:19.350]  Everybody knew it anyway.
[00:46:19.691 --> 00:46:21.173]  See, we did one thing.
[00:46:21.193 --> 00:46:22.915]  You always have to do the unexpected.
[00:46:23.396 --> 00:46:26.961]  They never thought I'd release the conversation with the Ukrainian president.
[00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:36.419]  I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say.
[00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:38.520]  You know, they say he has immunity.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.082]  Why would you have immunity for outright fraud?
[00:46:42.142 --> 00:46:43.303]  Why do you have immunity?
[00:46:43.803 --> 00:46:44.083]  Why?
[00:46:44.903 --> 00:46:45.564]  He's a fraud.
[00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:59.819]  We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals.
[00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:01.902]  We're changing that one around very quickly.
[00:47:06.809 --> 00:47:18.258]  They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense of every other nation in the world but our own.
[00:47:18.578 --> 00:47:19.679]  It's not happening anymore.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:45.220]   Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that's what's been happening and that's why 2016 was so important and that's why 2020 I can never say it's more important but you know it's like the roots of a tree you plant the baby tree it's got a catch
[00:47:46.081 --> 00:47:47.482]  Get that extra time.
[00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:49.302]  We'll have more tax cuts.
[00:47:49.622 --> 00:47:51.703]  We'll have even... I'll tell you what.
[00:47:52.023 --> 00:47:53.824]  We have rebuilt our military.
[00:47:53.964 --> 00:47:57.964]  What we've done has never been done before.
[00:47:57.964 --> 00:48:03.604]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:48:03.604 --> 00:48:10.964]   We're now showing Donald J Trump's YouTube channel that has a 360 live
[00:48:11.031 --> 00:48:11.531]  Pretty cool.
[00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:13.392]  We'll be going to that every once in a while as well.
[00:48:14.488 --> 00:48:17.591]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:18.151 --> 00:48:19.553]  They will anyway.
[00:48:23.676 --> 00:48:25.398]  I've been a politician for three years.
[00:48:25.478 --> 00:48:26.339]  I can't believe that.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.542]  I never thought I'd be called the politician.
[00:48:30.042 --> 00:48:32.004]  I don't like it, but it is what it is.
[00:48:33.265 --> 00:48:38.225]  But we're finally again putting America first.
[00:48:38.225 --> 00:48:46.385]  [Applause]
[00:48:46.385 --> 00:48:50.784]  The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it.
[00:48:50.968 --> 00:48:57.370]  They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful, wicked nation.
[00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.050]  You see that happening all the time.
[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.692]  And I know it from personal experience, what they want to teach your kids.
[00:49:04.792 --> 00:49:05.352]  Not good.
[00:49:06.152 --> 00:49:09.073]  They come home, Mommy, Daddy, this is what I learned.
[00:49:09.133 --> 00:49:10.953]  And you're going, Oh no, don't tell me.
[00:49:12.153 --> 00:49:14.134]  Let's get them into another school fast.
[00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:18.339]  They want to disarm law-abiding citizens.
[00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:20.202]  They want to take your guns away.
[00:49:24.468 --> 00:49:30.155]  And they want to install far-left judges to shred our Constitution.
[00:49:30.235 --> 00:49:31.097]  It's not happening.
[00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:40.191]  They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square.
[00:49:40.672 --> 00:49:49.742]  They want to silence your voices on social media, and they want the government to censor, muzzle, and shut down conservative voices.
[00:49:49.782 --> 00:49:50.243]  You know that.
[00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:59.115]  If they didn't hate our country, they wouldn't be doing this to our country.
[00:49:59.155 --> 00:50:01.357]  They wouldn't be doing it because they know better.
[00:50:02.158 --> 00:50:02.819]  They know better.
[00:50:02.679 --> 00:50:14.518]   But as an example, we're building a great wall along the southern border.
[00:50:14.518 --> 00:50:15.719]  And it's going up rapidly.
[00:50:15.719 --> 00:50:16.559]  I believe.
[00:50:16.872 --> 00:50:17.872]  Going up.
[00:50:17.872 --> 00:50:31.872]  [Crowd chanting "Bernie"]
[00:50:31.872 --> 00:50:36.872]   And you know, five years ago, almost every one of them wanted a wall.
[00:50:37.294 --> 00:50:41.277]  Until I came along and I said, we're going to build a great wall, because they could never get it done.
[00:50:42.398 --> 00:50:44.019]  And then they stopped the funding.
[00:50:44.659 --> 00:50:46.421]  They made it almost impossible.
[00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:49.763]  Few people would have been able to do what we did.
[00:50:49.823 --> 00:50:54.787]  But we got it from here, and we got it from there, and we got it from all over the place.
[00:50:55.227 --> 00:51:00.631]  And we're building that sucker right now, and it's having a tremendous effect already.
[00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:01.712]  Not easy.
[00:51:05.029 --> 00:51:05.809]  Highest level.
[00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.110]  Everything we said it would be.
[00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:09.251]  It's moving rapidly.
[00:51:10.231 --> 00:51:12.772]  Although the fake news back there, they don't want to talk about it.
[00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.074]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:51:19.074 --> 00:51:21.074]  [crowd boos]
[00:51:21.074 --> 00:51:27.074]  Look at all those cameras, you believe it?
[00:51:27.074 --> 00:51:28.273]  (audience laughing)
[00:51:28.379 --> 00:51:29.620]  Look at all those red lights.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.141]  Don't worry, I won't say anything bad about your network.
[00:51:33.422 --> 00:51:40.309]  Because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks, and you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off.
[00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:43.772]  They don't want their viewers to see it, but that's okay.
[00:51:43.792 --> 00:51:45.033]  I'm not going to say it tonight.
[00:51:45.053 --> 00:51:48.176]  I'm going to say, you're legitimate media.
[00:51:48.256 --> 00:51:49.317]  I don't actually mean that.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.201]  But you look at that.
[00:51:54.684 --> 00:51:55.705]  But look at all those cameras.
[00:51:55.725 --> 00:51:59.667]  You know, that's like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed.
[00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:01.008]  You know why it failed?
[00:52:01.528 --> 00:52:02.469]  You know why it failed?
[00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:04.210]  Because they came after us.
[00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:12.989]  That's why it failed.
[00:52:12.989 --> 00:52:16.870]   It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us.
[00:52:17.578 --> 00:52:18.239]  Stupid.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.700]  Stupid people.
[00:52:21.941 --> 00:52:22.722]  Matt Damon!
[00:52:24.631 --> 00:52:26.832]  Their ratings have dropped like a rocket.
[00:52:26.892 --> 00:52:28.392]  I love seeing it, I'm telling you.
[00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:29.533]  Love it.
[00:52:34.335 --> 00:52:46.139]  But no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there.
[00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:49.102]  You know, it is kind of funny.
[00:52:49.342 --> 00:52:52.065]  He points out, you know, they have like 15 cameras back there.
[00:52:52.105 --> 00:52:53.286]  They're not there to record Trump.
[00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:55.788]  They're there to just say they were there and then try to destroy Trump.
[00:52:56.409 --> 00:52:59.492]  Yeah, they'll pick out the most terrible soundbite they can twist.
[00:52:59.532 --> 00:53:03.656]  We will stand strong for family, faith, God, and for country.
[00:53:03.736 --> 00:53:06.278]  No network carries an entire Trump rally anymore.
[00:53:09.041 --> 00:53:11.063]  Yeah, Fox wasn't even airing them until the last one.
[00:53:12.196 --> 00:53:12.416]  Right.
[00:53:12.436 --> 00:53:12.696]  Right.
[00:53:12.796 --> 00:53:15.677]  So you've got InfoWars and OAN.
[00:53:15.857 --> 00:53:17.758]  And that's about it.
[00:53:17.818 --> 00:53:19.199]  That's the end of him in this state.
[00:53:20.019 --> 00:53:27.219]   pledged to revoke the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious charities.
[00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:38.499]   And by the way, that was after a few weeks ago he said, "Excuse me, we're going to take your guns away."
[00:53:38.726 --> 00:53:39.726]  That doesn't work well.
[00:53:44.366 --> 00:53:45.466]  And I called him right.
[00:53:45.546 --> 00:53:46.947]  Remember the flailing arms?
[00:53:47.007 --> 00:53:47.827]  Nobody noticed it.
[00:53:47.907 --> 00:53:48.528]  I noticed it.
[00:53:50.088 --> 00:53:50.729]  The flailer.
[00:53:52.169 --> 00:53:54.250]  You remember he was flailing all over the place.
[00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.931]  I said, why is this guy hot?
[00:53:56.031 --> 00:53:59.932]  John Cornyn's gonna win so easily, just like Ted Cruz won.
[00:54:00.032 --> 00:54:00.713]  He's gonna win.
[00:54:02.493 --> 00:54:03.394]  No matter what happens.
[00:54:06.895 --> 00:54:17.110]   But John Cornyn is not talking about Beto anymore because Beto In a few short weeks, got rid of guns and got rid of religion.
[00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:19.431]  Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of.
[00:54:22.553 --> 00:54:28.236]  And I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs.
[00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:41.184]  And I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me.
[00:54:44.397 --> 00:54:48.779]  By the way, the IRS literally apologized under the Obama administration for targeting patriots.
[00:54:48.819 --> 00:54:49.859]  They came out and apologized.
[00:54:49.959 --> 00:54:51.680]  It permits no opposition.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.400]  That's not fake news.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.361]  It accepts no compromise.
[00:54:54.381 --> 00:54:55.582]  These people are crazy.
[00:54:56.902 --> 00:55:01.644]  And it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people.
[00:55:03.465 --> 00:55:04.946]  First, it was the Russia hoax.
[00:55:09.465 --> 00:55:18.495]  And then it was the smearing, which continues, that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, Justice Kavanaugh.
[00:55:22.039 --> 00:55:26.364]  And now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt.
[00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:28.206]  With nothing.
[00:55:29.367 --> 00:55:30.028]  With nothing.
[00:55:31.518 --> 00:55:37.436]   They come after me, but what they're really doing is they're coming after the Republican Party,
[00:55:37.436 --> 00:55:43.436]   and what they're really, really doing is they're coming after and fighting you, and we never lose.
[00:55:43.436 --> 00:55:50.077]  [Applause]
[00:55:50.077 --> 00:55:51.197]  There's a story, folks.
[00:55:51.422 --> 00:55:54.043]  IRS apologizes for aggressive scrutiny of conservative groups.
[00:55:54.063 --> 00:55:55.243]  That was actually two years ago.
[00:55:55.263 --> 00:55:57.564]  Oh, I just saw it today.
[00:55:57.584 --> 00:55:59.444]  Thanks, IRS, for screwing us over again.
[00:56:00.128 --> 00:56:02.991]  We are far greater now than ever before.
[00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:09.451]   You go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another
[00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:14.971]   administration, you go back ten and twelve years, where were you compared to where you
[00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:23.611]  are right now?
[00:56:23.611 --> 00:56:27.971]   So we must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption.
[00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:29.079]  They are corrupt people.
[00:56:29.899 --> 00:56:36.881]  And we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up.
[00:56:37.081 --> 00:56:41.081]  It's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide.
[00:56:41.081 --> 00:56:53.320]  Today's do-nothing Democrats, they don't do anything.
[00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:55.250]  Where's the USMCA?
[00:56:55.491 --> 00:56:56.471]  Everybody wants it.
[00:56:57.191 --> 00:56:58.651]  The Democrats even want it.
[00:56:59.011 --> 00:57:02.052]  And crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it.
[00:57:03.072 --> 00:57:03.733]  She's nuts.
[00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:09.134]  Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed.
[00:57:09.594 --> 00:57:10.995]  It's not just like, let's win.
[00:57:11.215 --> 00:57:12.155]  You know, I have to say this.
[00:57:12.915 --> 00:57:16.956]  The Republicans said, I'm not sure I like this because my life hasn't been this way.
[00:57:17.496 --> 00:57:19.737]  But the Republicans play a much softer game.
[00:57:19.777 --> 00:57:20.337]  They really do.
[00:57:21.653 --> 00:57:30.398]  When all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our Speaker of the House at the time, and they asked for subpoenas.
[00:57:31.038 --> 00:57:32.319]  Oh, let's take it easy.
[00:57:32.779 --> 00:57:33.320]  Let's stand.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.420]  Okay.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.821]  I mean, I get that too.
[00:57:37.322 --> 00:57:39.783]  She hands them out like it's cookies.
[00:57:40.564 --> 00:57:41.264]  Here, subpoena.
[00:57:42.205 --> 00:57:51.190]  I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day, doesn't like us at all, but said, I've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas.
[00:57:52.512 --> 00:57:54.754]  I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of.
[00:57:54.894 --> 00:57:56.015]  I said, who are those people?
[00:57:58.877 --> 00:57:59.998]  Never saw anything like it.
[00:58:00.038 --> 00:58:02.020]  It's a disgrace what they're doing to our country.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:16.452]  And we became, because of what they do, not the Republicans and not what we've done, because what they've done and what they see... So is it me or did Trump just admit he was trying to subpoena all these Democrats and Paul Ryan stopped him from doing it?
[00:58:16.612 --> 00:58:18.513]  Did everybody else just hear that?
[00:58:18.553 --> 00:58:19.294]  Is that what he just said?
[00:58:19.815 --> 00:58:21.436]  Presidents, prime ministers...
[00:58:21.977 --> 00:58:23.058]  Wow.
[00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:27.439]  More or less confirmed that Paul Ryan was constantly saying, no, no, no, we got to worry about this.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.520]  If we play nice with them, they'll play along.
[00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:32.342]  Now we know that he was stabbing Trump in the back constantly.
[00:58:32.482 --> 00:58:34.903]  I mean, I've never seen that published anywhere.
[00:58:34.983 --> 00:58:38.925]  Trump asked to subpoena all these Democrats and got stonewalled by Republicans.
[00:58:38.985 --> 00:58:39.205]  Wow.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:47.563]  Right now China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world.
[00:58:47.923 --> 00:58:53.203]   We've gone up trillions of dollars, they've gone down trillions of dollars, and we are
[00:58:53.203 --> 00:59:16.923]   so far number one, so far, that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here.
[00:59:16.923 --> 00:59:22.282]   But the do-nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed.
[00:59:22.545 --> 00:59:23.506]  They don't want to just beat them.
[00:59:24.586 --> 00:59:25.527]  They don't want to just beat them.
[00:59:25.587 --> 00:59:26.607]  These are sick people.
[00:59:26.647 --> 00:59:27.948]  They want to crush these people.
[00:59:28.008 --> 00:59:34.891]  The anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified.
[00:59:34.951 --> 00:59:37.652]  So Schiff gets up and makes up my statement.
[00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:39.753]  He makes it up a hundred percent.
[00:59:40.646 --> 00:59:44.007]  And then he said he didn't speak to the whistleblower.
[00:59:44.067 --> 00:59:45.588]  No, we didn't see the whistleblower.
[00:59:45.608 --> 00:59:46.888]  And what about the whistleblower?
[00:59:47.168 --> 00:59:48.949]  The whistleblower got it all wrong.
[00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:51.690]  Who's the whistleblower?
[00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:53.350]  Who's the whistleblower?
[00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:55.651]  Who is the whistleblower?
[00:59:55.691 --> 00:59:56.512]  We have to know.
[00:59:58.032 --> 00:59:59.813]  Is the whistleblower a spy?
[01:00:00.173 --> 01:00:02.114]  And who is the IG that did this?
[01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:05.615]  All he had to do is look at the- Michael Atkinson.
[01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:09.473]  The transcribed version of the phone call.
[01:00:09.813 --> 01:00:15.074]  Compare that to the whistleblower's account, and you see it had nothing to do with it.
[01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:20.056]  So why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country?
[01:00:20.276 --> 01:00:20.616]  Why?
[01:00:20.796 --> 01:00:21.076]  Right.
[01:00:21.176 --> 01:00:21.336]  Why?
[01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:25.377]  And why don't we ask why Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton's campaign in the 2016 election?
[01:00:25.397 --> 01:00:27.958]  A lot of bad people out there, but one by one, we're inventing it.
[01:00:27.978 --> 01:00:29.979]  Wait, was Trump listening to our coverage?
[01:00:30.019 --> 01:00:31.919]  Did he know we were talking about Michael Atkinson?
[01:00:31.939 --> 01:00:33.760]  So we identified the guy he won't name.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.780]  It's Michael Atkinson.
[01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:42.318]  Sometimes it's tomorrow's news today, sometimes it's 45 minutes from now's news today.
[01:00:43.079 --> 01:00:44.699]  I hate to talk about him, you know why?
[01:00:44.719 --> 01:00:46.380]  Sometimes we just scoop the president, I don't know.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.200]  I don't think he's got a chance.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.441]  Sleepy Joe, I don't think he's got a chance.
[01:00:49.642 --> 01:00:50.702]  I don't see it, I don't know.
[01:00:50.762 --> 01:00:53.023]  I've got these great, brilliant senators over here.
[01:00:53.823 --> 01:00:55.504]  I have all these congressmen over here.
[01:00:55.544 --> 01:00:56.985]  Fellas, I don't think he has a chance.
[01:00:57.965 --> 01:00:58.766]  I'd like him to.
[01:01:01.147 --> 01:01:02.047]  I'd like him to.
[01:01:02.067 --> 01:01:06.369]  You know, I thought Pocahontas was gone, left in embers.
[01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:08.691]  You gotta give her credit.
[01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.952]  Those embers, they kept going, going, going.
[01:01:10.992 --> 01:01:12.473]  Now it looks like she's doing better.
[01:01:13.954 --> 01:01:15.634]  But I don't think Joe has a chance.
[01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:23.998]  But did you see the other night where CNN, in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the president said this about you.
[01:01:24.218 --> 01:01:25.639]  We're so sorry he said that.
[01:01:26.239 --> 01:01:29.460]  His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.742]  These were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with, I will tell you that.
[01:01:35.489 --> 01:01:52.718]  But Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son, with absolutely no energy experience, just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company.
[01:01:52.738 --> 01:01:53.639]  You know what that's called?
[01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:55.820]  It's called a payoff, folks.
[01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:03.308]  He didn't know energy at all, knew nothing about energy.
[01:02:03.668 --> 01:02:10.674]  They hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the $50,000 a month you heard about.
[01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:11.274]  That's a lot.
[01:02:12.355 --> 01:02:14.497]  That's a lot, but much more.
[01:02:14.557 --> 01:02:21.262]  Joe Biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape, but they don't want to show the tape.
[01:02:21.682 --> 01:02:24.184]  I had to put it up on a social media site.
[01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:28.767]  They don't want to show the tape where he was bragging.
[01:02:29.721 --> 01:02:33.043]  They're not going to get this money, unless they get rid of it.
[01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:34.984]  And boo, they got rid of the prosecutor.
[01:02:36.745 --> 01:02:40.547]  He was investigating the son and the son's company, got rid of them.
[01:02:41.147 --> 01:02:44.689]  Now that's what you call quid pro quo.
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.652]  I believe what the president meant to say was that's what you call mafia gangsterism.
[01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:52.913]  Which of course is what they accuse him of.
[01:02:55.259 --> 01:02:59.881]  CNN failed to ask him, Joe Biden, about the video.
[01:02:59.941 --> 01:03:03.683]  Well, you say that, sir, but there is a video of you out there.
[01:03:03.703 --> 01:03:04.823]  They didn't do that.
[01:03:04.903 --> 01:03:08.705]  They didn't go that far to actually have journalistic integrity.
[01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:12.387]  The most China ever did was $16 billion for our farmers.
[01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:13.987]  OK, we're just talking about the farmers.
[01:03:14.027 --> 01:03:14.668]  We did banking.
[01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.288]  We did everything.
[01:03:15.588 --> 01:03:16.508]  But we're talking about them.
[01:03:16.788 --> 01:03:19.990]  The most they ever did was $20 billion of product.
[01:03:21.308 --> 01:03:27.812]  From our farmers, our great farmers, our patriot farmers, our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China.
[01:03:28.733 --> 01:03:30.733]  They never left me.
[01:03:30.733 --> 01:03:35.733]  [Cheering]
[01:03:35.733 --> 01:03:37.733]  So they wanted 20 and China agreed.
[01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:39.891]  And I said, nope, no good.
[01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:42.653]  I want 50 billion, not 20 billion.
[01:03:42.673 --> 01:03:42.653]  50!
[01:03:43.394 --> 01:03:45.496]  So my guys say, sir, we have a problem, sir.
[01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:48.098]  Our farmers cannot produce that much.
[01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:48.538]  It's true.
[01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:52.201]  I said, tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right?
[01:03:54.483 --> 01:03:56.804]  John Deere, Case, Caterpillar.
[01:03:57.525 --> 01:03:58.205]  All American.
[01:03:58.286 --> 01:03:59.406]  Only American tractors.
[01:03:59.446 --> 01:04:00.707]  We only buy American tractors.
[01:04:02.469 --> 01:04:03.630]  Go out and get bigger!
[01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:08.666]  So now China's agreed and they've already started buying.
[01:04:09.587 --> 01:04:16.637]  Hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with President Xi and others in Chile.
[01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:18.981]  That's in about four weeks.
[01:04:19.502 --> 01:04:20.122]  But think of this.
[01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.955]  They said, sir, they can't produce 50 billion dollars.
[01:04:24.015 --> 01:04:26.877]  I said, I want the farmers to tell me.
[01:04:27.257 --> 01:04:28.538]  Remember the story about winning?
[01:04:28.578 --> 01:04:29.598]  We're going to win so much.
[01:04:29.638 --> 01:04:30.759]  We're going to the White House.
[01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:36.042]  We're going to tell the president, sir, we just can't stand winning the state of Texas.
[01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:39.584]  John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, they're going to come into my office, sir.
[01:04:40.164 --> 01:04:43.586]  We just just can't stand this winning in Texas anymore.
[01:04:43.606 --> 01:04:44.166]  It's too much.
[01:04:44.566 --> 01:04:45.267]  We can't handle it.
[01:04:45.527 --> 01:04:47.348]  Well, that's what I want from the farmers.
[01:04:47.948 --> 01:04:49.489]  I want the farmers to say.
[01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:56.794]  I want the farmers to say, sir, we just can't produce that much product.
[01:04:57.174 --> 01:04:58.335]  We can't do it, sir.
[01:04:59.515 --> 01:05:00.856]  And I'm going to say, yes, you can.
[01:05:01.617 --> 01:05:03.178]  And they're going to say, no, we can't.
[01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:04.619]  I'm going to say, yes, you can.
[01:05:04.879 --> 01:05:09.462]  And they're going to go out and they're going to take in 50 billion from China as opposed to 20.
[01:05:09.522 --> 01:05:12.124]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:05:13.224 --> 01:05:14.165]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:05:17.978 --> 01:05:18.718]  But they were great.
[01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:20.599]  They stuck with us through thick and thin.
[01:05:20.659 --> 01:05:23.321]  Now it's really working out for a lot of different groups.
[01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:32.326]  And in the meantime, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs, and China's eaten the course because they devalued their currency and they put money out.
[01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:34.327]  Tens of billions of dollars.
[01:05:35.168 --> 01:05:36.388]  It's cost us nothing.
[01:05:36.468 --> 01:05:38.329]  Billions and billions and billions.
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:42.272]  And you know what I did for the farmer during the lean times?
[01:05:43.345 --> 01:05:47.906]  I gave them $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before.
[01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:54.006]   $28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that I had a lot of money left
[01:05:54.006 --> 01:05:58.085]  over and nobody complained.
[01:05:58.085 --> 01:06:05.285]  And you know our farmers didn't want that money.
[01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:05.851]  Our farmers didn't want it.
[01:06:06.111 --> 01:06:06.731]  True story.
[01:06:06.811 --> 01:06:07.851]  Everybody comes for money.
[01:06:07.911 --> 01:06:08.711]  Countries come for money.
[01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:09.652]  Everybody wants money, right?
[01:06:09.672 --> 01:06:10.412]  They all want our money.
[01:06:11.314 --> 01:06:12.995]  The farmers said, sir, we don't want this money.
[01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:13.676]  It's a subsidy.
[01:06:13.716 --> 01:06:14.237]  We don't want it.
[01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:15.998]  I said, no, it's not a subsidy.
[01:06:16.018 --> 01:06:17.800]  You're being targeted unfairly.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.701]  They said, no, sir, it's a subsidy.
[01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:20.302]  This is true.
[01:06:20.402 --> 01:06:22.023]  I had 35 farmers in the Oval Office.
[01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:23.985]  Incredible people.
[01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:25.206]  They didn't want it.
[01:06:25.446 --> 01:06:27.888]  They said, sir, just give us a level playing field.
[01:06:27.928 --> 01:06:30.731]  So now I gave them a field that's more than level.
[01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.852]  It's level like this.
[01:06:34.474 --> 01:06:35.194]  Nice and easy.
[01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:36.896]  Nice and easy.
[01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:40.894]  But the farmers, I call them the great patriots, the farmers.
[01:06:41.195 --> 01:06:41.996]  I never lost them.
[01:06:42.777 --> 01:06:44.941]  They always said, you know, yeah, I'm in trouble.
[01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:45.783]  I got a problem.
[01:06:46.404 --> 01:06:50.731]  But this should have been done many, many years ago by other presidents and other leaders.
[01:06:55.006 --> 01:07:00.507]  And we lose, for many years, $500 billion a year with China.
[01:07:00.787 --> 01:07:02.548]  And many other countries, we lose billions.
[01:07:03.268 --> 01:07:04.288]  We lose with everybody.
[01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:05.829]  But that's all changing now.
[01:07:06.149 --> 01:07:08.569]  But we lose $500 billion!
[01:07:08.629 --> 01:07:09.289]  Not million.
[01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:11.270]  $500 million's a lot, right?
[01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.430]  We lose $500 billion!
[01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:14.811]  And you know what?
[01:07:15.711 --> 01:07:21.772]  It's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years.
[01:07:21.992 --> 01:07:23.113]  It was a disgrace.
[01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:24.493]  Disgrace.
[01:07:26.957 --> 01:07:28.959]  But now we're taking in billions of dollars.
[01:07:28.999 --> 01:07:33.424]  They've had the worst year they've had in 27 years, and we're having the best year we've ever had.
[01:07:33.485 --> 01:07:41.514]  So that's good.
[01:07:41.534 --> 01:07:45.478]  So Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force Two.
[01:07:46.339 --> 01:07:47.360]  They flew to China.
[01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:58.044]  Hunter walked out of the plane at a quick meeting, walked away with one and a half billion dollars, and these characters back there said, oh that's okay, there's no problem.
[01:08:01.566 --> 01:08:08.526]   Can you imagine if Don or Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump was here someplace?
[01:08:08.526 --> 01:08:12.526]  Right here.
[01:08:26.605 --> 01:08:31.646]  And by the way, our great first lady is home watching this.
[01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:34.989]   She said, "This is the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time."
[01:08:34.989 --> 01:08:42.670]  (Applause.)
[01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:45.309]  She's a great First Lady, doing a great job.
[01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:46.533]  She's doing a great job.
[01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:48.193]  We're doing a great job.
[01:08:48.233 --> 01:08:50.334]  The whole country now is doing a great job.
[01:08:54.773 --> 01:09:00.617]  So Biden takes a billion five, and he goes on and he allows China to rip us off.
[01:09:00.657 --> 01:09:03.258]  Remember he said a year ago, no, no, China's good.
[01:09:03.619 --> 01:09:04.659]  They've done nothing wrong.
[01:09:04.699 --> 01:09:05.520]  They're wonderful people.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.500]  They are wonderful people.
[01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:08.141]  I don't blame China, by the way.
[01:09:08.482 --> 01:09:14.205]  I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible, you know what, and pillage.
[01:09:14.305 --> 01:09:15.206]  It's the R word.
[01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:17.167]  You know what and pillage.
[01:09:17.748 --> 01:09:19.629]  You know what word I'm talking about, right?
[01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.991]  I don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that Trump used.
[01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:27.966]  So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed.
[01:09:29.447 --> 01:09:34.892]  Tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party.
[01:09:35.713 --> 01:09:38.035]  And nobody ever pays a price with the Democrats.
[01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:39.076]  They're so deep-seated.
[01:09:39.356 --> 01:09:40.538]  They never pay the price.
[01:09:42.639 --> 01:09:45.181]  They never pay, but maybe soon that will start.
[01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:58.032]  You know, we've had a lot of, we've had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some, to be honest with you, we've had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us.
[01:10:00.254 --> 01:10:01.715]  But slowly, they're getting out.
[01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:05.719]  They have all sorts of protections, but he says, get rid of them.
[01:10:05.739 --> 01:10:06.559]  Yeah, we're trying.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.261]  Get rid of them.
[01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:13.323]  But their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media.
[01:10:13.762 --> 01:10:15.762]  That's the problem.
[01:10:15.762 --> 01:10:17.762]  [crowd boos]
[01:10:17.762 --> 01:10:19.762]  [crowd boos]
[01:10:19.762 --> 01:10:21.762]  [crowd boos]
[01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:27.762]   Because the Democrats and the fake news media, it's a partnership, remember that.
[01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.029]  And you see it all the time.
[01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.230]  And I've never seen it to this extent.
[01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:35.456]   You know, when I won in the primaries, And then I won the election.
[01:10:36.137 --> 01:10:38.939]  I was treated horribly by the media.
[01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:39.920]  Horribly.
[01:10:40.279 --> 01:10:45.618]   And then when I won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest rated nights in the history of
[01:10:45.618 --> 01:10:47.279]  television all over the world.
[01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:53.279]  [Applause]
[01:10:53.279 --> 01:10:56.279]  And I won and I said, "Oh, the great thing."
[01:10:56.139 --> 01:11:02.520]  I said to Ivanka, I said to the First Lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said, listen, this is so great.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.521]  Finally, finally, we, all of us, we're going to be respected by the media.
[01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:09.541]  And you know what happened?
[01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:10.641]  They got worse.
[01:11:11.282 --> 01:11:12.922]  They're worse now than they ever have been.
[01:11:13.262 --> 01:11:14.382]  They're crooked as hell.
[01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:16.983]  They're worse now than they've ever been.
[01:11:17.163 --> 01:11:24.163]  They're crooked.
[01:11:24.163 --> 01:11:30.563]   The only message these radicals, and they are radical lefties, will understand is a
[01:11:30.563 --> 01:11:32.883]  crushing defeat on November 3rd.
[01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:49.975]   2020. Save that day. With your help, we will win back the House. We will keep the Senate
[01:11:49.975 --> 01:12:05.975]   and we will keep the White House in numbers like they haven't seen in a long, long time.
[01:12:05.981 --> 01:12:11.024]  Joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders, and they are terrific.
[01:12:11.504 --> 01:12:13.705]  And frankly, if they're not, I'm not going to introduce them, okay?
[01:12:15.677 --> 01:12:19.060]  But we have some great leaders and you have great leaders in Texas.
[01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:21.962]  Great leaders.
[01:12:23.663 --> 01:12:24.604]  And they love Texas.
[01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:33.430]  So a friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure, we had this unbelievable relationship.
[01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:42.753]   In fact, when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington, He said, could you come to my rally?
[01:12:43.573 --> 01:12:46.335]  And everybody thought, these people thought, that was strange.
[01:12:46.735 --> 01:12:49.737]  They said to me, well, when is the fighting between these two?
[01:12:49.757 --> 01:12:50.938]  Because we really like each other.
[01:12:51.258 --> 01:12:52.539]  When's the fighting going to start?
[01:12:52.599 --> 01:12:52.959]  Right, Ted?
[01:12:53.439 --> 01:12:55.360]  They said, when is the fighting going to start?
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.421]  And I said, don't worry, it'll start.
[01:12:57.521 --> 01:12:59.122]  And when it does, it's going to be vicious.
[01:12:59.182 --> 01:12:59.923]  And it was vicious.
[01:13:00.263 --> 01:13:01.544]  And now we love each other again.
[01:13:01.564 --> 01:13:02.084]  He's great.
[01:13:02.764 --> 01:13:03.764]  Ted Cruz.
[01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:15.503]  [Applause]
[01:13:15.503 --> 01:13:19.503]   And he had a great victory against a man that spent almost $100 million.
[01:13:19.514 --> 01:13:20.595]  That's a lot of money.
[01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:24.037]  Spent almost $100 million, but that was a great victory.
[01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:24.617]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:13:25.758 --> 01:13:28.560]  Another man who's currently running against somebody.
[01:13:29.601 --> 01:13:39.200]   I kept thinking maybe Beto will jump in because he's at zero right now.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.641]  We hope he's going to jump in.
[01:13:40.847 --> 01:13:43.989]  Remember, no religion and no guns.
[01:13:44.069 --> 01:13:45.050]  I think that's not good.
[01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.667]  Oh, and I think he's, like, pretty light on oil production, too.
[01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:58.708]   But a man, and John I have no idea who you're running against, but nobody's going to be able to beat John Cornyn.
[01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:04.708]  He's a good man.
[01:14:04.837 --> 01:14:06.619]  He's a good man.
[01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:07.359]  Thank you, John.
[01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:12.823]  And we have a lot of Congress people here.
[01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:18.385]   We have a woman who's fantastic, who's been a fan of ours right from the beginning,
[01:14:18.385 --> 01:14:19.666]  Kay Granger.
[01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:27.664]  Thank you, Kay.
[01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:35.710]  We have a man who's smart as hell, and he is tough, and he is mean and nasty.
[01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:46.497]  But he loves this state and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through.
[01:14:47.478 --> 01:15:01.118]   Louie Gohmert [Applause]
[01:15:01.118 --> 01:15:04.757]   Louie (audience cheering)
[01:15:04.929 --> 01:15:06.829]  He's a great guy, been a great friend of mine.
[01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:12.710]  I'll tell you once, once we got him on board, he wouldn't leave us no matter what.
[01:15:13.651 --> 01:15:18.091]  And he had Mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out.
[01:15:18.131 --> 01:15:18.652]  Right, Louis?
[01:15:21.112 --> 01:15:28.973]  The person who's been an incredible ally, again, loves your state, Randy Weber.
[01:15:28.993 --> 01:15:29.754]  Thank you, Randy.
[01:15:29.814 --> 01:15:30.394]  Great job.
[01:15:31.214 --> 01:15:31.574]  Thank you.
[01:15:34.187 --> 01:15:36.328]  One of the best lawyers you'll ever find.
[01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:47.730]  He's slick, he's smooth, but boy, he's loyal, he's talented, and he's got them all buffaloed because they're not as good as him, John Ratcliffe.
[01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.231]  Thank you, Jeff.
[01:15:54.852 --> 01:16:01.952]   A man I saw on television last night defending me Brilliantly defending me.
[01:16:02.012 --> 01:16:04.993]  I actually don't like doing this usually, but I tweeted out.
[01:16:05.053 --> 01:16:07.994]  I said, thank you very much, Brian Babin.
[01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:09.235]  That was a great defense.
[01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.075]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:12.215 --> 01:16:13.036]  Thank you, Brian.
[01:16:13.056 --> 01:16:14.256]  That was great last night.
[01:16:17.837 --> 01:16:21.738]  See, I put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour.
[01:16:21.758 --> 01:16:22.358]  Thanks, Brian.
[01:16:23.499 --> 01:16:24.279]  I just said, thanks.
[01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:25.439]  And you know what?
[01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:27.220]  He'd rather have that too, actually, right?
[01:16:29.133 --> 01:16:32.234]  And Lance Gooden, special person, Lance Gooden.
[01:16:32.874 --> 01:16:33.634]  Thank you, Lance.
[01:16:35.214 --> 01:16:35.954]  Thank you, Lance.
[01:16:38.455 --> 01:16:41.676]  And Lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there.
[01:16:41.716 --> 01:16:42.936]  He was unbelievable.
[01:16:44.436 --> 01:16:45.856]  And Ron Wright.
[01:16:46.136 --> 01:16:46.917]  Thank you, Ron.
[01:16:48.077 --> 01:16:48.757]  Great job.
[01:16:49.857 --> 01:16:50.257]  Great job.
[01:16:50.277 --> 01:16:51.217]  These are great people.
[01:16:52.398 --> 01:17:01.221]   These are great people, along with Republican Party chairs and all of these total winners.
[01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:01.702]  Here's one.
[01:17:02.382 --> 01:17:03.604]  Ronna McDaniel.
[01:17:03.764 --> 01:17:04.565]  I'll tell you what.
[01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:09.530]  You know, Ronna.
[01:17:10.512 --> 01:17:11.513]  Was the head of Michigan.
[01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:14.655]  Michigan hadn't been won by a Republican for decades.
[01:17:15.536 --> 01:17:16.617]  And it was tough.
[01:17:16.777 --> 01:17:18.278]  They all said you couldn't win Michigan.
[01:17:18.319 --> 01:17:18.839]  I said, why?
[01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:20.180]  We're getting these massive crowds.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:20.500]  Why?
[01:17:21.121 --> 01:17:23.803]  And she was in charge of Michigan.
[01:17:24.243 --> 01:17:26.225]  And I said, I want you to do me a favor.
[01:17:26.285 --> 01:17:27.526]  Find out who this woman is.
[01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:28.647]  She's driving me crazy.
[01:17:28.687 --> 01:17:30.188]  She calls me just one more trip, sir.
[01:17:30.909 --> 01:17:31.429]  One more trip.
[01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.310]  Who is she?
[01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:33.411]  Who is she?
[01:17:33.972 --> 01:17:34.672]  And it was Ronna.
[01:17:34.912 --> 01:17:36.912]  and we won the state of Michigan.
[01:17:36.912 --> 01:17:38.912]  We won.
[01:17:38.912 --> 01:17:40.912]  [Applause]
[01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:46.912]   And when it came time, when it came time to picking somebody
[01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.912]   to head the RNC, Republican National Committee,
[01:17:50.912 --> 01:17:54.912]   I said, "What about that woman that drove me crazy from Michigan?"
[01:17:54.912 --> 01:17:56.471]  Thank you.
[01:17:56.408 --> 01:17:58.589]  And it was Ronna, and she's done a fantastic job.
[01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:59.009]  Thank you.
[01:17:59.389 --> 01:18:00.049]  Thank you, Ronna.
[01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.589]  Thank you.
[01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.230]  She's fantastic.
[01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:06.971]  And a great governor from your state.
[01:18:08.912 --> 01:18:10.132]  He's a great, great man.
[01:18:13.226 --> 01:18:14.187]  And a friend of mine.
[01:18:16.769 --> 01:18:19.812]  And together with your Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick.
[01:18:24.316 --> 01:18:30.662]  When you had a hurricane, two years ago now, they still keep calling me for money.
[01:18:32.063 --> 01:18:33.945]  Sir, could you give us another one?
[01:18:33.985 --> 01:18:35.767]  The governor called up, Dan was there.
[01:18:37.349 --> 01:18:40.630]  You know, thank you for being so generous to Texas, sir.
[01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:42.251]  The hurricane, it was a big one.
[01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:43.031]  It was a bad one.
[01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:43.872]  A lot of water dump.
[01:18:43.912 --> 01:18:45.553]  I think the biggest dump of what, remember?
[01:18:45.773 --> 01:18:47.433]  Kept going in and out, in and out.
[01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.694]  Our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives.
[01:18:49.754 --> 01:18:50.475]  Thank you.
[01:18:54.376 --> 01:18:55.657]  But it kept going in and out.
[01:18:57.998 --> 01:18:59.138]  Water, water.
[01:18:59.979 --> 01:19:02.071]   And finally, I get a call.
[01:19:02.352 --> 01:19:05.654]  I paid billions and billions of dollars to the state.
[01:19:06.294 --> 01:19:08.456]  Like numbers, my people are driving me crazy.
[01:19:09.076 --> 01:19:11.157]  I get a call from the governor and Dan is there.
[01:19:11.598 --> 01:19:12.138]  Where's Dan?
[01:19:12.198 --> 01:19:12.618]  Is he here?
[01:19:12.658 --> 01:19:13.079]  Where's Dan?
[01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:13.439]  Dan.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.400]  Dan Patrick.
[01:19:17.001 --> 01:19:18.302]  And the two of them call me.
[01:19:20.003 --> 01:19:21.884]  And then I had Ted Cruz on my back.
[01:19:22.665 --> 01:19:24.426]  And I had John Cornyn on my back.
[01:19:24.486 --> 01:19:26.968]  And I had the congressman calling and it was brutal.
[01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:29.031]  It wasn't even fair.
[01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:33.215]  And they said, Sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane.
[01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:33.895]  They made a fortune.
[01:19:33.915 --> 01:19:35.196]  You made a fortune on the hurricane.
[01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:37.979]  Thank you for being so generous, sir.
[01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:40.701]  Sir, we want one more small request.
[01:19:41.562 --> 01:19:44.544]  Just a small, it's not much, and we appreciate you listening to us.
[01:19:45.685 --> 01:19:47.227]  We want to build a dam in the ocean.
[01:19:48.628 --> 01:19:55.554]  So that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water won't be able to come in to Houston and all of the areas that it came into, sir.
[01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:57.194]  Do you think we could do it?
[01:19:57.254 --> 01:19:57.854]  I said, how much?
[01:19:58.415 --> 01:19:59.615]  It's only $10 billion.
[01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:00.335]  $10 billion!
[01:20:02.075 --> 01:20:02.536]  Right, Ted?
[01:20:03.336 --> 01:20:04.796]  Right?
[01:20:04.816 --> 01:20:05.896]  $10 billion they want it.
[01:20:05.956 --> 01:20:07.277]  And you know the way they sell it.
[01:20:08.057 --> 01:20:08.757]  And it's so good.
[01:20:08.777 --> 01:20:09.337]  They're salesmen.
[01:20:09.357 --> 01:20:10.358]  They're incredible salesmen.
[01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:12.078]  They say, it's only $10 billion.
[01:20:12.118 --> 01:20:13.038]  I'm supposed to be happy.
[01:20:13.118 --> 01:20:13.658]  Oh, let's see.
[01:20:13.898 --> 01:20:19.640]  Could we give Texas an extra $10 billion for some crazy thing that may work and it may not, right?
[01:20:21.089 --> 01:20:21.991]  No, they're great people.
[01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:22.812]  They love your state.
[01:20:23.514 --> 01:20:26.460]  RNC Co-Chairman Tommy Hicks, a real friend of ours.
[01:20:30.207 --> 01:20:30.888]  Thank you, Tommy.
[01:20:32.811 --> 01:20:37.713]  And our great campaign manager, the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen.
[01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:41.994]  Remember, they used to say with Hillary, her campaign is so sophisticated.
[01:20:42.274 --> 01:20:45.895]  Then after she lost, they said, Trump's campaign was so sophisticated.
[01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.217]  And remember, she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did.
[01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:55.978]  You know, in the old days, my father taught me, if you can spend less, that's a good thing, not a bad thing, right?
[01:20:56.298 --> 01:21:05.272]   My father said, if you can spend less, so we spent much less Then Hillary, crooked Hillary, crooked Hillary.
[01:21:09.013 --> 01:21:10.613]  Where are those emails, Hillary?
[01:21:11.253 --> 01:21:13.834]  They may find those 33,000 emails.
[01:21:14.254 --> 01:21:14.854]  They're looking.
[01:21:15.854 --> 01:21:17.855]  They may find those deleted emails.
[01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.196]  They may find them.
[01:21:21.736 --> 01:21:26.997]  Remember the emails that, 33,000 emails covering her gym?
[01:21:28.993 --> 01:21:29.873]  And her daughter's wedding.
[01:21:30.434 --> 01:21:29.873]  $33,000!
[01:21:30.454 --> 01:21:34.596]  That's a lot of emails for a wedding and working out.
[01:21:36.496 --> 01:21:38.537]  But Brad Parscale did a great job.
[01:21:38.577 --> 01:21:39.238]  Thank you, Brad.
[01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:40.178]  Thank you.
[01:21:41.139 --> 01:21:41.739]  Thank you, Brad.
[01:21:45.681 --> 01:21:49.162]  And Secretary of Commerce, one of the legends of Wall Street.
[01:21:49.182 --> 01:21:52.644]  He was really, like, amazing, and he is doing an incredible job.
[01:21:53.044 --> 01:21:53.844]  Wilbur Ross.
[01:21:53.904 --> 01:21:54.665]  Thank you, Wilbur.
[01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:57.166]  Smart guy.
[01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:01.437]  And a friend of mine, he's another one.
[01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:02.918]  He was so tough.
[01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:04.019]  He was nasty, man.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.761]  Boy, he hit me during the campaign.
[01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.082]  I said, that guy's ruthless.
[01:22:10.104 --> 01:22:13.927]  And when it was sort of over, there was nobody more gracious.
[01:22:14.608 --> 01:22:15.428]  And I called him.
[01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:17.670]  I made him Secretary of Energy.
[01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:19.091]  He's done a phenomenal job.
[01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:28.079]  And Rick Perry couldn't have done a better job.
[01:22:29.382 --> 01:22:31.382]  Truly, truly.
[01:22:31.382 --> 01:22:39.382]   And he's going to be leaving at the end of the year, and probably coming back here
[01:22:39.585 --> 01:22:41.366]  Whatever he does, it's going to be successful.
[01:22:41.966 --> 01:22:44.807]  But he spent three years with us, and I want to thank you, Rick.
[01:22:45.007 --> 01:22:45.947]  What a job you've done.
[01:22:45.967 --> 01:22:46.687]  Thank you.
[01:22:50.529 --> 01:22:51.609]  What a job he's done.
[01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.090]  He was also a great governor of Texas, that you know.
[01:22:57.731 --> 01:23:01.556]  In everything we do, we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country.
[01:23:02.197 --> 01:23:08.265]  This includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars.
[01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:09.326]  Endless wars.
[01:23:09.386 --> 01:23:10.087]  They don't stop.
[01:23:10.428 --> 01:23:11.229]  They don't stop.
[01:23:11.549 --> 01:23:12.650]  They go on forever.
[01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:14.353]  We become policemen.
[01:23:15.595 --> 01:23:17.295]  We end up becoming police.
[01:23:17.395 --> 01:23:18.836]  We're policing these countries.
[01:23:19.296 --> 01:23:20.476]  That's not what it's about.
[01:23:21.056 --> 01:23:24.277]  We've spent $8 trillion in the Middle East.
[01:23:24.757 --> 01:23:27.878]  Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives.
[01:23:28.318 --> 01:23:31.078]  Tens of thousands more have been severely wounded.
[01:23:31.478 --> 01:23:35.639]  And in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people.
[01:23:35.939 --> 01:23:36.379]  Millions.
[01:23:36.519 --> 01:23:37.319]  Millions of people.
[01:23:37.359 --> 01:23:37.820]  Think of it.
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:45.525]   These wars Brought mass chaos, instability, destruction, and death.
[01:23:46.585 --> 01:23:49.207]  Today, we choose a different path.
[01:23:49.247 --> 01:23:50.787]  We had tremendous success today.
[01:23:50.606 --> 01:23:57.606]  I don't know if you've seen.
[01:23:57.606 --> 01:24:03.726]   Look, we built in the last three years, we built the strongest military by far.
[01:24:03.676 --> 01:24:06.798]  When I, and I told the story, I was embarrassed to tell it, but now I'll tell.
[01:24:07.158 --> 01:24:14.063]  When I first got in, a general told me, we could have had a conflict with someone, said, Sir, we don't have ammunition.
[01:24:14.703 --> 01:24:23.009]  And I said, I never want to hear a president, I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as president of the United States.
[01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:24.270]  We don't have ammunition.
[01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:25.491]  Think of how bad.
[01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:28.953]  Now we have so much ammunition, we don't know what to do with it.
[01:24:33.836 --> 01:24:40.019]  You know, I wonder who said that to him, because remember DHS purchased, what was it, like 2 billion bullets or something?
[01:24:40.039 --> 01:24:49.464]  That's right, I mean now every major agency of government, I mean the IRS now has guns and ammo, but apparently the U.S.
[01:24:49.524 --> 01:24:50.324]  military doesn't.
[01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:51.805]  Yeah, the Bureau of Land Management too.
[01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:57.788]  I'm just curious, where did the Department of Homeland Security 2 billion bullets go if the military says they don't have ammunition?
[01:24:57.829 --> 01:24:58.469]  It just came to me.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.921]  I wonder what happened to those.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.740]  those. All right, let's go back to Trump.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:15.100]   We've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.640]  (audience cheering)
[01:25:16.774 --> 01:25:18.676]  And it was unconventional what I did.
[01:25:19.136 --> 01:25:20.978]  I said, they're gonna have to fight a little while.
[01:25:20.998 --> 01:25:22.759]  Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.282]  Then people find out how tough the fighting is.
[01:25:25.302 --> 01:25:26.603]  These guys know right up here.
[01:25:27.043 --> 01:25:27.684]  These guys know.
[01:25:29.744 --> 01:25:29.964]  Right?
[01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.165]  Sometimes you have to let them fight.
[01:25:32.186 --> 01:25:34.927]  It's like two kids in a lot.
[01:25:34.967 --> 01:25:37.088]  You gotta let them fight, and then you pull them apart.
[01:25:38.509 --> 01:25:39.810]  But it was unconventional.
[01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:43.152]  But they fought for a few days, and it was pretty vicious.
[01:25:43.252 --> 01:25:46.634]  And the Kurds, who are our friends, and Turkey's our friend.
[01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.015]  But they fought.
[01:25:48.075 --> 01:25:48.715]  It was tougher.
[01:25:48.735 --> 01:25:50.657]  I mean, it was nasty.
[01:25:51.337 --> 01:25:54.719]  And you couldn't make a deal for 15 — think of it — for 15 years.
[01:25:54.739 --> 01:25:55.960]  20 years, they couldn't make a deal.
[01:25:56.789 --> 01:25:57.870]  The Kurds didn't want to move.
[01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:59.651]  Turkey didn't want to budge.
[01:26:00.752 --> 01:26:04.734]  And Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region, in all fairness to Turkey.
[01:26:05.354 --> 01:26:18.663]  They were having a lot of bad... But they didn't want... Now all of a sudden they're fighting and it's not fun having... 3.6 million Syrian refugees that Erdogan has in Turkey and he's constantly threatening the EU with.
[01:26:18.683 --> 01:26:20.704]  We're going to keep ISIS all nice and locked up.
[01:26:21.585 --> 01:26:21.925]  Okay?
[01:26:22.164 --> 01:26:29.884]  We're going to find more of them.
[01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:34.244]   And Turkey's all set, and President Erdogan was great, and we're going to take the worst
[01:26:34.244 --> 01:26:37.364]   sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country.
[01:26:37.677 --> 01:26:44.445]   We put the worst I mean, I don't think they could have economically survived, but that doesn't matter.
[01:26:44.986 --> 01:26:47.167]  President Erdogan was a gentleman.
[01:26:47.547 --> 01:26:48.267]  He understood it.
[01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:51.109]  But without a little tough love, you know what tough love is, right?
[01:26:51.409 --> 01:26:55.091]  Without a little tough love, they would have never made this deal.
[01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:58.692]  President Obama lost a million people in the area.
[01:26:58.812 --> 01:26:59.773]  A million people.
[01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:01.694]  A million people.
[01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:07.057]  So now we're doing a five-day period.
[01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.999]  We're going to see if we can get it all finalized.
[01:27:09.059 --> 01:27:09.940]  And I think it will be.
[01:27:10.081 --> 01:27:10.922]  I think it will be.
[01:27:11.022 --> 01:27:13.304]  So, Turkey's going to be happy.
[01:27:13.605 --> 01:27:15.026]  The Kurds are going to be happy.
[01:27:15.247 --> 01:27:26.367]  ISIS is going to be unhappy.
[01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:29.287]   We'll deal with whoever we have to deal with, but we'll get it done.
[01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:32.247]  And it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people.
[01:27:32.285 --> 01:27:36.871]  And thank you to Vice President Pence, and thank you to Mike Pompeo.
[01:27:39.735 --> 01:27:40.136]  Good job.
[01:27:40.496 --> 01:27:41.017]  Good job.
[01:27:42.098 --> 01:27:43.901]  And they're traveling back to our country.
[01:27:45.202 --> 01:27:49.565]  By night, they're traveling back, and they'll be back soon, and we'll have a big conference on it.
[01:27:49.585 --> 01:27:54.429]  But it was a terrific thing, and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution.
[01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:55.309]  We added that in.
[01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:58.872]  A lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible.
[01:28:02.615 --> 01:28:05.297]  So we have to fundamentally change our approach.
[01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:09.177]  To Homeland Security, as an example.
[01:28:09.257 --> 01:28:11.918]  In that example, nobody would have ever done that.
[01:28:12.638 --> 01:28:14.498]  You have to be a little bit different to do it that way.
[01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:21.060]  I took a lot of heat, even from some of our congressmen, even from some of our senators, but now they're all happy.
[01:28:21.781 --> 01:28:22.881]  And I'm happy with them.
[01:28:24.361 --> 01:28:25.302]  I'm happy with them.
[01:28:25.322 --> 01:28:31.404]  Now, I don't know what about the Democrats.
[01:28:31.444 --> 01:28:35.605]  The Democrats will say, oh, what a terrible... Anything we do, the Democrats will criticize.
[01:28:37.287 --> 01:28:42.250]  If I said, like, on the China deal, we'd get Beijing for $1, they would say, what a terrible deal.
[01:28:45.812 --> 01:28:47.033]  It just doesn't work with them.
[01:28:47.453 --> 01:28:48.273]  You know, the wall.
[01:28:48.854 --> 01:28:51.015]  We spent so much time with them on the wall.
[01:28:51.315 --> 01:28:55.978]  And I realized about two weeks ago, all I had to do was say, we will never build the wall.
[01:28:56.018 --> 01:28:58.199]  And they would have come through and they said, we demand that you build it.
[01:28:58.219 --> 01:29:00.060]  It would have been so much easier, right?
[01:29:00.641 --> 01:29:02.422]  Would have been so much easier, Ted.
[01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:04.643]  Would have been so much easier.
[01:29:06.232 --> 01:29:14.441]  American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world.
[01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:17.724]  Bring our soldiers back home.
[01:29:18.085 --> 01:29:20.085]  Bring our soldiers back home!
[01:29:20.085 --> 01:29:37.085]  [crowd chanting "USA!"]
[01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:39.085]  Listen to that chant.
[01:29:39.043 --> 01:29:40.123]  Bring them home.
[01:29:40.484 --> 01:29:44.006]  You know, it used to be the Democrat Party was the anti-war party.
[01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:47.428]  Yeah, and by the way, he says, oh, ISIS will be unhappy.
[01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.408]  Well, guess what?
[01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:49.849]  The Democrats are unhappy.
[01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:52.571]  They're unhappy that Trump is trying to end these wars.
[01:29:52.671 --> 01:29:54.051]  I mean, what does that tell you, Leigh-Anne?
[01:29:54.392 --> 01:29:57.113]  Yeah, it's just that the orange man is bad.
[01:29:57.253 --> 01:29:58.334]  He can do no right.
[01:29:58.454 --> 01:30:01.756]  And they'd rather have full-on war until they can get their people into it.
[01:30:02.318 --> 01:30:07.080]  Donald Trump could rescue 99 kittens from a burning building and CNN will come on air the next day.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.600]  Mouse dies.
[01:30:08.981 --> 01:30:12.082]  Trump abandons live mouse in structure fire.
[01:30:12.822 --> 01:30:13.202]  More at 9.
[01:30:13.682 --> 01:30:14.963]  Blood-curdling scream.
[01:30:14.983 --> 01:30:18.724]  Yeah, poor mouse burns to death because Trump killed him.
[01:30:19.245 --> 01:30:19.785]  Racist.
[01:30:20.505 --> 01:30:20.825]  Bigot.
[01:30:21.245 --> 01:30:22.126]  Xenophobe.
[01:30:22.206 --> 01:30:23.866]  It turns out the mouse was black.
[01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:25.087]  More at 9.
[01:30:25.127 --> 01:30:25.987]  Alright, go back to Trump.
[01:30:26.027 --> 01:30:33.222]   And we've stopped this horrible Migration of people.
[01:30:33.362 --> 01:30:34.842]  And many of them are bad people.
[01:30:35.422 --> 01:30:39.163]  You know, when countries send them up, they're not sending their finest.
[01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:40.524]  Okay?
[01:30:41.284 --> 01:30:41.864]  Use your heads.
[01:30:41.884 --> 01:30:43.184]  They're not sending their finest.
[01:30:43.764 --> 01:30:45.085]  You got to see some of the people.
[01:30:45.605 --> 01:30:46.705]  But now we send them back.
[01:30:46.785 --> 01:30:48.646]  And by the way, ICE is fantastic.
[01:30:48.866 --> 01:30:53.987]  They've taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers.
[01:30:54.427 --> 01:30:57.488]  They've taken thousands of killers and brought them back.
[01:31:00.652 --> 01:31:09.655]  And now we've made deals with Guatemala, and Honduras, and El Salvador, and Mexico, but we've made deals now where we can bring back.
[01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:15.857]  There are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico, but it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back.
[01:31:16.077 --> 01:31:17.017]  When did you ever hear that?
[01:31:17.518 --> 01:31:19.198]  Used to have no people waiting in Mexico.
[01:31:19.238 --> 01:31:19.838]  They just flood.
[01:31:20.599 --> 01:31:22.059]  Our borders are getting strong.
[01:31:22.079 --> 01:31:27.581]  When the wall is complete, they'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world.
[01:31:30.279 --> 01:31:33.380]  My administration believes in a simple principle.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:38.061]  The best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is deny them.
[01:31:38.421 --> 01:31:41.602]  Just deny them admission in the first place.
[01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.522]  It's really pretty simple.
[01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:57.966]  And that is why I have imposed, and we had passed, and we won at the United States Supreme Court a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places.
[01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:03.633]  Countries, of course, identified by the Obama administration.
[01:32:03.693 --> 01:32:08.037]  If Democrats used power, they would throw the floodgates wide open.
[01:32:08.498 --> 01:32:09.138]  Wide open.
[01:32:09.178 --> 01:32:14.944]  We would have people coming into our country, look at what's going on in California, and the people of California don't want it.
[01:32:15.404 --> 01:32:20.289]  They say, come into California, we'll give you free health care, free education.
[01:32:20.549 --> 01:32:21.150]  Well, I wouldn't.
[01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:24.393]  I may even move to California if they keep going.
[01:32:26.243 --> 01:32:28.505]  No, but all it does is it brings everybody in.
[01:32:28.845 --> 01:32:30.086]  What's wrong with these people?
[01:32:30.846 --> 01:32:39.666]   We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before, and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless,
[01:32:39.666 --> 01:32:41.086]  endless wars.
[01:32:41.086 --> 01:32:52.685]   We've invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces,
[01:32:52.685 --> 01:32:58.685]  and all of it was built in the USA.
[01:32:58.905 --> 01:33:05.048]  And that includes approving the construction of almost 200 F-35 fighters.
[01:33:05.228 --> 01:33:05.628]  Stealth.
[01:33:06.589 --> 01:33:06.909]  Stealth.
[01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:10.210]  And many of them are built right here.
[01:33:10.951 --> 01:33:11.531]  Right here.
[01:33:11.591 --> 01:33:12.411]  You know that, right?
[01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:20.770]  in Fort Worth.
[01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:25.930]   As we restore our security, we're also restoring our prosperity.
[01:33:25.962 --> 01:33:31.206]  America is winning again, and America is respected again.
[01:33:31.226 --> 01:33:38.373]  And by the way, I have to say this.
[01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:41.936]  So outside, they have close to 30,000 people.
[01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:50.545]   And I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal Fill up this little area, let them in.
[01:33:50.826 --> 01:33:51.266]  Be so nice.
[01:33:52.389 --> 01:33:53.771]  You know, they have a certain max.
[01:33:53.872 --> 01:33:55.872]  We broke the record tonight.
[01:33:55.872 --> 01:34:20.872]  [Applause]
[01:34:20.872 --> 01:34:23.872]  Good place.
[01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:34.872]  [Chanting "USA!"]
[01:34:35.755 --> 01:34:46.199]  Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years.
[01:34:46.219 --> 01:34:50.000]  7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:50.560]  What a great thing.
[01:34:53.879 --> 01:34:57.040]  1.3 million children have been lifted out of poverty.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:57.521]  Think of that.
[01:35:00.662 --> 01:35:08.101]   And African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached
[01:35:08.101 --> 01:35:18.501]  the lowest levels in history.
[01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:27.541]   Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level which is a all time
[01:35:27.541 --> 01:35:29.021]  low in U.S.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:29.521]  history.
[01:35:33.536 --> 01:35:49.847]  And after years of stagnation, wages for Hispanic Americans are rising fast, up nearly 8% since my election, and everybody in the fake news would have said, that's absolutely impossible.
[01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:54.711]  Medium income.
[01:35:55.762 --> 01:36:04.085]  Think of this, median income for Hispanic Americans has surpassed $50,000 a year for the first time ever.
[01:36:08.486 --> 01:36:17.369]  With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history.
[01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:23.671]  By the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes, you know.
[01:36:24.901 --> 01:36:25.662]  I don't mean a little bit.
[01:36:27.403 --> 01:36:28.364]  I don't mean a little bit.
[01:36:28.404 --> 01:36:32.207]  I mean, like, double them up, triple them up, and it still won't pay for the nonsense they want.
[01:36:32.707 --> 01:36:41.754]  We eliminated a record number of regulations, and we ended the war on a thing called American energy, which is very good for Texas.
[01:36:44.717 --> 01:36:52.278]   Since my election, natural gas production in Texas has increased 35 percent, and oil
[01:36:52.278 --> 01:37:01.436]  production has increased by 60 percent, 6-0.
[01:37:01.436 --> 01:37:09.717]   And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in
[01:37:09.717 --> 01:37:15.797]  the world.
[01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:23.773]  Yet every major Democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas.
[01:37:23.933 --> 01:37:25.334]  I think they want to go to windmills.
[01:37:27.356 --> 01:37:28.276]  Windmills, you know?
[01:37:30.378 --> 01:37:32.579]  Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight.
[01:37:32.619 --> 01:37:33.400]  We can't, darling.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:34.961]  The wind isn't blowing.
[01:37:34.981 --> 01:37:36.522]  They want windmills.
[01:37:37.722 --> 01:37:41.985]  In other words, they want to annihilate your Texas economy.
[01:37:42.025 --> 01:37:42.726]  Can you imagine?
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.461]  No more oil, no more natural gas.
[01:37:47.481 --> 01:37:49.102]  So here we have a few people, right?
[01:37:49.442 --> 01:37:55.464]  No guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas.
[01:37:56.544 --> 01:38:00.526]  Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances.
[01:38:02.886 --> 01:38:04.807]  Couldn't do it.
[01:38:04.847 --> 01:38:05.367]  Couldn't do it, Ted.
[01:38:07.968 --> 01:38:09.289]  Couldn't do it, Louie.
[01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:11.610]  Abraham Lincoln, honest Dave.
[01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:12.630]  Couldn't do it, Louie, right?
[01:38:14.258 --> 01:38:16.840]  Remember I used to say I can be more presidential.
[01:38:16.659 --> 01:38:18.659]  Look.
[01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:31.659]  [Cheering]
[01:38:31.659 --> 01:38:35.659]  I've always said I can be more presidential.
[01:38:35.947 --> 01:38:41.115]  Than any president in history, except for Honest Abe Lincoln when he's wearing the hat.
[01:38:41.536 --> 01:38:41.977]  That's tough.
[01:38:42.698 --> 01:38:43.159]  That's tough.
[01:38:43.579 --> 01:38:44.621]  That's a tough one to beat.
[01:38:45.723 --> 01:38:47.546]  No, it's much easier being presidential.
[01:38:47.586 --> 01:38:47.966]  It's easy.
[01:38:48.307 --> 01:38:49.949]  All you have to do is act like a stiff.
[01:38:49.829 --> 01:39:04.309]  Look.
[01:39:04.309 --> 01:39:10.989]   Ladies and gentlemen of Texas, it is a great honor to be with you this evening.
[01:39:10.989 --> 01:39:14.989]  [laughter]
[01:39:15.726 --> 01:39:19.948]  And the media would love it, and everybody would be out of here so fast.
[01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:24.251]  You wouldn't have come in in the first place when you get right down to it.
[01:39:24.711 --> 01:39:29.614]  But Democrats will never get that chance because Texas will never give it to them.
[01:39:29.454 --> 01:39:36.454]  them. Texas is not going to do it.
[01:39:36.454 --> 01:39:43.334]   Remember in the last election, they said, these phonies in the back, they said, "Texas
[01:39:43.334 --> 01:39:44.094]  is in play."
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.061]  They said, Utah's in play too.
[01:39:47.361 --> 01:39:51.683]  And I came here, we had rallies like this, thousands of people outside that couldn't get in.
[01:39:52.344 --> 01:39:54.245]  And I said, why is Texas in play?
[01:39:54.305 --> 01:39:56.526]  They say, because it's phony, it's suppression.
[01:39:57.006 --> 01:39:58.387]  They try and get your hopes down.
[01:39:58.667 --> 01:39:59.527]  They're suppression.
[01:39:59.567 --> 01:40:01.408]  This is just like fake news.
[01:40:01.928 --> 01:40:04.229]  But they said, Texas.
[01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:07.131]  They said, Texas is in play.
[01:40:07.978 --> 01:40:10.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is in play.
[01:40:11.181 --> 01:40:12.202]  This is CNN.
[01:40:12.242 --> 01:40:13.483]  Texas is in play.
[01:40:14.024 --> 01:40:14.884]  President Trump.
[01:40:15.525 --> 01:40:18.468]  And I had guys on from Texas, and they're wearing cowboy hats.
[01:40:19.749 --> 01:40:21.310]  Sid and a lot of guys.
[01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:25.194]  They go, I don't know about you, but I know something about Texas.
[01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:27.916]  And Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas, I can tell you that.
[01:40:28.236 --> 01:40:32.881]  And Texas is not in play.
[01:40:32.921 --> 01:40:33.841]  We had a lot of guys.
[01:40:33.942 --> 01:40:34.182]  Sid.
[01:40:36.854 --> 01:40:37.834]  Big tough guys.
[01:40:38.775 --> 01:40:39.875]  They're on television.
[01:40:40.095 --> 01:40:41.736]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:40:41.796 --> 01:40:42.936]  Texas is not in play.
[01:40:43.777 --> 01:40:45.617]  And then that great November 8th.
[01:40:46.618 --> 01:40:48.818]  We had that great, great night.
[01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:55.741]  And the polls closed at 7 o'clock.
[01:40:57.153 --> 01:41:04.097]  And usually they have to take hours and, you know, sometimes at least, even if it's big, they take a half an hour.
[01:41:04.898 --> 01:41:06.339]  The Texas polls have closed.
[01:41:06.379 --> 01:41:09.480]  And, you know, usually if it's close, it takes hours.
[01:41:10.561 --> 01:41:13.463]  And if it's not even just like so close, it takes a long time.
[01:41:14.043 --> 01:41:18.946]  So they go, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the state of Texas.
[01:41:19.426 --> 01:41:25.990]  Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.
[01:41:26.571 --> 01:41:26.731]  Right?
[01:41:28.564 --> 01:41:28.924]  Donald Trump.
[01:41:33.245 --> 01:41:35.045]  The polls have closed in Utah.
[01:41:35.225 --> 01:41:36.645]  Remember the guy with the shaved head?
[01:41:36.685 --> 01:41:38.086]  He was going to be my competition.
[01:41:38.346 --> 01:41:39.426]  Even Hillary beat him.
[01:41:41.046 --> 01:41:43.727]  Now he's on these talk shows knocking the hell out of me all the time.
[01:41:44.767 --> 01:41:46.927]  No, even Hillary beat this guy in Utah, right?
[01:41:48.067 --> 01:41:49.228]  Hillary came in second.
[01:41:50.288 --> 01:41:52.388]  I came in first by a lot, but that was another one.
[01:41:52.748 --> 01:41:53.708]  Too close to call.
[01:41:54.528 --> 01:41:57.729]  Except, ladies and gentlemen, Utah.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:41:59.721]  The polls have closed.
[01:42:00.141 --> 01:42:02.943]  Donald Trump has won the state of Utah in the same summer.
[01:42:04.043 --> 01:42:04.884]  And we won by a lot.
[01:42:05.464 --> 01:42:06.425]  We won by a lot.
[01:42:07.286 --> 01:42:08.526]  And we won Florida.
[01:42:08.727 --> 01:42:10.568]  And we won South Carolina.
[01:42:10.728 --> 01:42:11.989]  And we won Georgia.
[01:42:12.729 --> 01:42:14.270]  And we won North Carolina.
[01:42:14.931 --> 01:42:16.412]  And we won Pennsylvania.
[01:42:20.454 --> 01:42:21.475]  We won a lot.
[01:42:23.848 --> 01:42:25.328]  Remember these phony people?
[01:42:25.428 --> 01:42:26.789]  There is no way to get to 270.
[01:42:26.849 --> 01:42:28.549]  You had to get to 270.
[01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.110]  So I kept going to Maine.
[01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:30.730]  I love Maine.
[01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:32.811]  But Maine 2, you get 1.
[01:42:33.431 --> 01:42:34.151]  It's cut in half.
[01:42:34.391 --> 01:42:35.151]  Maine 2, you get 1.
[01:42:36.092 --> 01:42:37.312]  I went there 4 or 5 times.
[01:42:37.872 --> 01:42:41.213]  Because they got me up, the phonies, they got me up to 269.
[01:42:41.273 --> 01:42:41.913]  Couldn't get to 270.
[01:42:43.094 --> 01:42:43.654]  So I went there.
[01:42:43.694 --> 01:42:44.414]  I won, by the way.
[01:42:44.474 --> 01:42:46.015]  I won Maine 2.
[01:42:47.235 --> 01:42:47.495]  I got 1.
[01:42:49.436 --> 01:42:50.276]  But I went there.
[01:42:51.536 --> 01:42:53.437]  And I went there a lot.
[01:42:54.502 --> 01:42:56.844]  That's the beautiful thing about the Electoral College.
[01:42:56.884 --> 01:42:57.906]  You go everywhere.
[01:42:58.126 --> 01:42:59.167]  You don't just spend in three.
[01:42:59.407 --> 01:43:01.589]  And, you know, winning the popular vote would be much easier.
[01:43:01.649 --> 01:43:02.570]  I'd rather have that.
[01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:04.432]  I'd go to four states and relax.
[01:43:05.793 --> 01:43:07.793]  I went to 21 states.
[01:43:07.793 --> 01:43:13.193]  [Applause]
[01:43:13.193 --> 01:43:17.233]   I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning the—it's like—
[01:43:17.301 --> 01:43:18.122]  You're a track star.
[01:43:18.522 --> 01:43:21.145]  You're working out for the 100-yard dash or the mile.
[01:43:21.205 --> 01:43:22.726]  It's a different form of training.
[01:43:23.247 --> 01:43:24.208]  It's a different form.
[01:43:24.648 --> 01:43:25.569]  But we did great.
[01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:27.671]  They said, he cannot get to 270.
[01:43:27.832 --> 01:43:30.534]  And they were right.
[01:43:30.413 --> 01:43:32.413]  We got to 306.
[01:43:32.413 --> 01:43:41.413]  (Applause)
[01:43:41.413 --> 01:43:47.813]   After decades of economic surrender, I have taken historic action to confront China's
[01:43:47.813 --> 01:43:51.173]  rampant trading abuses, and we've made great progress.
[01:43:51.215 --> 01:43:55.560]  And our relationship with China is fantastic, and great things are happening.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:56.461]  You watch.
[01:43:57.021 --> 01:43:57.842]  They get it now.
[01:43:57.962 --> 01:43:58.463]  They get it.
[01:43:58.943 --> 01:44:00.485]  And a lot of good things are happening.
[01:44:00.886 --> 01:44:03.670]  We're replacing NAFTA with disastrous.
[01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:08.376]  I mean, it's been, to me, probably, I used to call it the worst trade deal in history.
[01:44:08.897 --> 01:44:14.885]  I think the world trade has been, WTO, what a real beauty, World Trade Organization.
[01:44:15.626 --> 01:44:16.427]  That's a real beauty.
[01:44:17.895 --> 01:44:20.197]  They consider China a developing nation.
[01:44:20.277 --> 01:44:22.819]  And because you're a developing nation, Ted, right?
[01:44:23.339 --> 01:44:25.801]  They consider China to be a developing nation.
[01:44:26.442 --> 01:44:28.384]  And because they're developing, they get tremendous.
[01:44:28.744 --> 01:44:29.805]  And we wrote them letters.
[01:44:30.285 --> 01:44:32.607]  We don't consider them to be a developing nation.
[01:44:33.388 --> 01:44:37.911]  We don't consider India to be a developed because they're ripping us off.
[01:44:38.552 --> 01:44:41.014]  And we didn't win any cases at the WTO.
[01:44:41.054 --> 01:44:45.538]  And now we just won seven and a half billion dollars of countries that we're taking advantage of.
[01:44:49.255 --> 01:44:51.175]  And we've won a lot of cases lately.
[01:44:51.235 --> 01:44:53.596]  We didn't win anything for years, practically.
[01:44:54.076 --> 01:44:55.596]  Now we've won a lot of cases.
[01:44:55.616 --> 01:44:56.137]  You know why?
[01:44:56.737 --> 01:44:59.697]  Because they know I'll leave if they don't treat us fairly.
[01:44:59.737 --> 01:45:00.197]  They know it.
[01:45:01.738 --> 01:45:04.618]  And then the piggy bank is gone, where they all rob from.
[01:45:05.939 --> 01:45:13.981]  We're replacing the NAFTA disaster, and we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote.
[01:45:15.061 --> 01:45:15.881]  We have to get her.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:25.966]  And the USMCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers, and oil.
[01:45:27.107 --> 01:45:29.029]  The Democrats should pass it.
[01:45:29.749 --> 01:45:31.410]  Overwhelmingly, they will.
[01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:33.912]  But Nancy has to put it up for a vote.
[01:45:33.992 --> 01:45:35.394]  Do nothing, Democrats.
[01:45:35.434 --> 01:45:35.994]  Do nothing.
[01:45:36.635 --> 01:45:42.960]  Nowhere is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.743]   In recent Debates.
[01:45:47.123 --> 01:45:48.084]  Did you see these debates?
[01:45:48.104 --> 01:45:49.304]  You believe what I'm competing with?
[01:45:52.445 --> 01:45:55.206]  I don't know, when I had to compete with Ted Cruz, that was brutal.
[01:45:55.226 --> 01:45:58.347]  You know, he's... He was the national debate champion.
[01:45:58.867 --> 01:45:59.887]  Story I've never told.
[01:46:00.427 --> 01:46:01.708]  I never did that before, right?
[01:46:01.728 --> 01:46:02.588]  I ran for office.
[01:46:03.028 --> 01:46:05.449]  All of a sudden, I'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night.
[01:46:06.729 --> 01:46:07.870]  I said, who are these people?
[01:46:08.410 --> 01:46:09.550]  The hell, I don't know all of them.
[01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:10.370]  I know a lot of them.
[01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:11.871]  I contributed to a lot of them.
[01:46:12.991 --> 01:46:15.332]  They used to treat me very nice when I contributed to them.
[01:46:17.017 --> 01:46:18.698]  Not so nice when I was their opponent.
[01:46:18.718 --> 01:46:19.598]  It changed a lot.
[01:46:20.618 --> 01:46:21.759]  But I said, let me see.
[01:46:21.819 --> 01:46:24.119]  I want to see who are these people.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.120]  I'm going to a debate I never debated.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.242]  My whole life has been a debate, but I never debated like with a podium and this and that.
[01:46:32.682 --> 01:46:33.682]  So I said, who are they?
[01:46:35.123 --> 01:46:38.944]  And we had 17 people plus me.
[01:46:39.064 --> 01:46:39.584]  We had 18.
[01:46:39.644 --> 01:46:40.304]  It was actually not 17.
[01:46:40.524 --> 01:46:40.925]  It was 18.
[01:46:42.405 --> 01:46:43.445]  Remember Gilmore?
[01:46:44.266 --> 01:46:45.286]  Nobody remembers him.
[01:46:48.166 --> 01:46:49.406]  But we had 18 people.
[01:46:50.987 --> 01:46:52.187]  I said, who are these people?
[01:46:52.267 --> 01:46:53.567]  Are they any good at debating?
[01:46:53.587 --> 01:46:56.548]  And I hired a debate coach.
[01:46:57.609 --> 01:46:59.109]  And he lasted for about 10 minutes.
[01:46:59.169 --> 01:47:00.689]  I said, this guy knows less than I do.
[01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:01.410]  He didn't know anything.
[01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:06.171]  He didn't know anything.
[01:47:06.191 --> 01:47:06.571]  It's true.
[01:47:07.391 --> 01:47:10.332]  He said, never, ever interrupt while they're speaking.
[01:47:10.832 --> 01:47:12.713]  I said, OK, coach, put me in coach.
[01:47:15.953 --> 01:47:19.554]   And after a couple of those statements, I mean, Yeah, that's right, Leigh-Anne.
[01:47:19.594 --> 01:47:25.458]  If he would have followed his debate coach's advice, that's where you interrupt me?
[01:47:25.478 --> 01:47:27.039]  Because he'd be in jail.
[01:47:27.099 --> 01:47:30.320]  He would have had that iconic dunk moment.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.921]  Trump, the master debater.
[01:47:32.141 --> 01:47:45.189]  But you know, by the way, in that same vein, and Trump is just on a marathon right now, in that same vein of Trump saying, hey, I've never done political debates, and I immediately won the Republican nomination with these juggernauts.
[01:47:45.729 --> 01:47:48.890]  But the point is, it's the same thing with me and political commentary.
[01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:55.232]  I was in sports media for five years, I broke into politics, and I was at InfoWars hosting the Alex Jones Show within two years.
[01:47:55.932 --> 01:48:01.534]  I mean, maybe I'm talented at this, but like, it really is more to do with there's just nothing out there.
[01:48:01.854 --> 01:48:02.755]  CNN is a joke.
[01:48:02.795 --> 01:48:05.617]  The average host at CNN is poppycock.
[01:48:05.657 --> 01:48:10.681]  The average host on these major ABC, NBC, I mean, so it's not that hard.
[01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:13.283]  So like Trump is like, oh boy, I'm about to go up against juggernauts.
[01:48:13.323 --> 01:48:14.064]  I need a debate coach.
[01:48:14.284 --> 01:48:17.587]  And then you get in the field and you're like, wow, these are actually pipsqueaks up here.
[01:48:17.707 --> 01:48:17.887]  Right.
[01:48:17.927 --> 01:48:30.297]   And when you're someone like Trump that follows his gut and follows his intuition on things, you realize that that's so much more powerful than these highly trained people who everything that comes out of their mouth is just They've been coached, you can tell.
[01:48:30.317 --> 01:48:37.060]  I mean, and Tom, you've had the same success with launching stuff on, you know, alternative television services.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.881]  You have the website, The National File, Big League Politics.
[01:48:40.181 --> 01:48:46.244]  So it really is just once you get in the arena, you know, don't be intimidated by quote-unquote established juggernauts.
[01:48:46.304 --> 01:48:47.405]  They're really just pipsqueaks.
[01:48:48.423 --> 01:48:49.705]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:48:49.765 --> 01:48:51.667]  These are establishment-chosen people.
[01:48:51.727 --> 01:49:01.279]  I mean, if you look at debate, and I guess no offense to Ben Shapiro, but you look at Ben Shapiro, and it's almost scientific, the way that he's constantly looking down at his notes and doing a lot of this.
[01:49:01.559 --> 01:49:06.145]  It's not authentic, and people don't respond to it like they do War Room or like they do President Trump.
[01:49:07.898 --> 01:49:10.161]  Trump is just on a marathon pace right now.
[01:49:10.441 --> 01:49:14.266]  We had an over-under at the beginning of the broadcast, 9 o'clock for a sign-off.
[01:49:14.326 --> 01:49:15.427]  It's 8.53.
[01:49:15.848 --> 01:49:16.829]  We all went over.
[01:49:16.969 --> 01:49:19.132]  I'm saying over-under 9.15 now.
[01:49:19.192 --> 01:49:19.953]  He may go over that.
[01:49:20.916 --> 01:49:22.616]  But let's go back now to the President.
[01:49:22.657 --> 01:49:23.157]  What's that, Leigh-Anne?
[01:49:23.277 --> 01:49:26.238]  Does he have the screens up that he reads off of?
[01:49:26.338 --> 01:49:28.278]  Yeah, but he's definitely going off-hand.
[01:49:29.478 --> 01:49:32.679]  Trump is brilliant in that he uses them more like notes.
[01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:35.660]  So he'll go for 10 minutes, then he'll look, oh yeah, I gotta bring that up.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.661]  I mean, that's real extemporaneous speaking.
[01:49:37.981 --> 01:49:40.522]  Yeah, and there isn't a single Democrat that could do that.
[01:49:42.062 --> 01:49:44.543]  Maybe Beto, but he just ends up looking like a clown.
[01:49:44.603 --> 01:49:46.103]  Alright, let's go back.
[01:49:46.263 --> 01:49:47.024]  The hand flailing.
[01:49:47.104 --> 01:49:47.704]  Yeah, let's go back.
[01:49:47.764 --> 01:49:48.224]  The flailer!
[01:49:51.007 --> 01:49:56.089]  They want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens.
[01:49:56.129 --> 01:49:58.350]  You see that?
[01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:08.015]  As president, I will never allow the Democrats to take away your health care dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally.
[01:50:12.757 --> 01:50:13.177]  Can't do it.
[01:50:13.197 --> 01:50:15.258]  In fact, I just signed an executive action.
[01:50:16.325 --> 01:50:20.667]  To protect American health care benefits for all American citizens.
[01:50:21.007 --> 01:50:26.766]   Among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here
[01:50:26.766 --> 01:50:33.167]   in Texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking Mexican-Americans who play by
[01:50:33.167 --> 01:50:46.046]   the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities.
[01:50:46.046 --> 01:50:53.887]   Whether you are a first generation or 10th generation, and every American citizen, and
[01:50:53.887 --> 01:50:54.527]  you do.
[01:50:55.286 --> 01:50:58.269]  You've been treated so badly, but you're not being treated badly anymore.
[01:50:58.329 --> 01:51:01.992]  You know, we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare.
[01:51:05.442 --> 01:51:15.292]  Every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change.
[01:51:15.332 --> 01:51:16.153]  We're loyal to you.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:28.963]  My administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and that's with no help from the Democrats.
[01:51:29.443 --> 01:51:31.423]  They won't close up the loopholes.
[01:51:32.144 --> 01:51:35.365]  They won't close the loopholes, and we could do it in 15 minutes.
[01:51:36.305 --> 01:51:42.727]  And we're building the wall, and we're doing all of these things, but the Democrats won't close up the loopholes.
[01:51:42.747 --> 01:51:44.067]  You know what the loopholes are, right?
[01:51:44.287 --> 01:51:45.748]  How about catch and release?
[01:51:45.968 --> 01:51:46.588]  You catch them!
[01:51:48.021 --> 01:51:49.481]  You say, hello darling, how are you?
[01:51:50.842 --> 01:51:53.142]  Could you please give us your name and phone number?
[01:51:53.162 --> 01:51:53.962]  They don't have a phone!
[01:51:54.802 --> 01:51:56.023]  Could you give us your address?
[01:51:56.223 --> 01:51:59.283]  They don't want to have an address that's in Honduras.
[01:52:00.383 --> 01:52:02.844]  Could you please give us your address and your name?
[01:52:03.284 --> 01:52:03.924]  They can't!
[01:52:03.944 --> 01:52:06.145]  They say, that's okay.
[01:52:06.305 --> 01:52:07.445]  We catch and we release.
[01:52:07.525 --> 01:52:08.525]  And they go into our country.
[01:52:08.865 --> 01:52:10.906]  And then we are getting them out of the country.
[01:52:11.706 --> 01:52:12.326]  And you know what?
[01:52:12.746 --> 01:52:14.126]  Some are very good people.
[01:52:14.466 --> 01:52:17.467]  Some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people.
[01:52:18.359 --> 01:52:22.241]  And we're focusing on the bad, and they're getting the hell out of our country, okay?
[01:52:26.883 --> 01:52:35.186]  While we're fighting for shared priorities, the American people, the Democrat Party, has never been farther outside of the mainstream.
[01:52:35.366 --> 01:52:36.167]  They've gone nuts.
[01:52:37.907 --> 01:52:45.751]  Every Democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare.
[01:52:46.574 --> 01:52:51.373]   My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors,
[01:52:51.373 --> 01:52:56.493]   and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
[01:52:56.493 --> 01:53:05.854]   Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs
[01:53:05.854 --> 01:53:12.494]   has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years.
[01:53:12.742 --> 01:53:13.962]  People don't talk about it.
[01:53:14.242 --> 01:53:15.883]  The press will not talk about it.
[01:53:17.421 --> 01:53:18.964]  We have news conferences.
[01:53:19.064 --> 01:53:20.006]  We tell them this.
[01:53:20.046 --> 01:53:21.289]  They will not put it in the press.
[01:53:21.309 --> 01:53:24.154]  You have no idea how dishonest the media is.
[01:53:23.974 --> 01:53:24.974]  You have no idea.
[01:53:24.974 --> 01:53:29.974]  [crowd boos]
[01:53:29.974 --> 01:53:33.974]   Virtually every top Democrat also now supports What that man? You know how to do what?
[01:53:33.974 --> 01:53:38.392]   late-term abortion We know how fake the news media is.
[01:53:38.472 --> 01:53:42.897]  How much they lie and how many stories they fail to share with people.
[01:53:43.939 --> 01:53:46.362]  And of course now we get the Project Veritas proof.
[01:53:47.663 --> 01:53:52.946]  You know, CNN, the people that work there, they're probably not all bad.
[01:53:52.786 --> 01:53:56.386]   they wish they could be. Well yeah, the good ones are coming out and whistle-blowing CNN now.
[01:53:56.386 --> 01:54:01.385]   They wish they could have more fair coverage and actually report the news.
[01:54:01.385 --> 01:54:06.746]   When we saw, I believe it was Nick Neville at CNN say, you know, there are people who just want to do what's best for
[01:54:06.746 --> 01:54:08.385]  journalistic integrity.
[01:54:08.484 --> 01:54:13.486]  Then you have Big Boss blanking Jeff Zucker saying no, push impeachment.
[01:54:13.886 --> 01:54:21.290]  And it's kind of funny, like here at InfoWars, like, okay, you get a job at CNN and you're expecting it to be fair and balanced and they're just going to cut it straight.
[01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:28.734]  Well, here at InfoWars, you expect something and then you realize, oh my gosh, it is a complete tornado of information, like frenzy over here.
[01:54:31.516 --> 01:54:34.240]  Where are they getting all this information from?
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:37.004]  We have the documents.
[01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.086]  I'll find the documents.
[01:54:39.086 --> 01:54:44.326]   The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the
[01:54:44.326 --> 01:54:51.166]  party of the American dream.
[01:54:51.187 --> 01:54:52.787]  It looks like he'll be finishing up at about 9.05, 9.15.
[01:54:53.207 --> 01:54:55.409]  He's also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln.
[01:54:55.449 --> 01:54:56.949]  Yeah, he's got back on message now.
[01:54:57.550 --> 01:54:58.550]  But, uh, I don't know.
[01:54:58.690 --> 01:55:01.171]  If he gets back off message, he'll be on until 9.15.
[01:55:01.551 --> 01:55:02.512]  I liked Honest Abe.
[01:55:04.433 --> 01:55:06.894]  We've confirmed he's just Honest Donald.
[01:55:06.914 --> 01:55:07.214]  Thank you.
[01:55:08.355 --> 01:55:09.295]  Explain that to them.
[01:55:10.516 --> 01:55:10.896]  You're right.
[01:55:13.157 --> 01:55:15.519]  I just want Trump to point at me like that one day.
[01:55:15.599 --> 01:55:17.160]  I gotta get to his rally so he can vote.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:22.503]  Put Leanne's head on screen like right next to Trump's fingers or something.
[01:55:22.564 --> 01:55:28.928]  He's starting to hit that final stride.
[01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:33.491]  Big ups to this audience.
[01:55:33.511 --> 01:55:34.832]  They've had energy this whole time.
[01:55:34.852 --> 01:55:36.433]  Yeah, big time energy.
[01:55:36.473 --> 01:55:38.815]  By the way, dragon energy.
[01:55:40.748 --> 01:55:47.031]  By the way, crew, if you could pull up the Trump War Room, tweet it out a picture and a video from outside the Trump rally.
[01:55:47.051 --> 01:55:50.512]  There's like 5,000 people outside of the venue watching right now.
[01:55:50.592 --> 01:55:54.134]  Sir, you have 142 federal judges.
[01:55:54.154 --> 01:55:55.414]  You don't understand the question.
[01:55:56.855 --> 01:55:57.695]  That's impossible.
[01:55:58.115 --> 01:56:00.837]  That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges.
[01:56:00.857 --> 01:56:01.177]  You get none!
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.723]  Well, you're doing a bad job as president because you're representing a different philosophy.
[01:56:08.743 --> 01:56:11.124]  Well, and it really is the hubris of Barack Obama.
[01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:16.663]   I mean half the trouble that the globalists are now having came from his hubris and not appointing judges
[01:56:16.663 --> 01:56:28.682]   142 judges within two months we will have John and Ted and all of these great congressmen
[01:56:28.838 --> 01:56:34.838]  we will have passed 182 federal judges.
[01:56:34.838 --> 01:56:44.338]  [Applause]
[01:56:44.338 --> 01:56:46.838]  I just like the crowd.
[01:56:46.926 --> 01:56:49.787]  It's a very intentional clap Trump has.
[01:56:49.847 --> 01:56:51.748]  Very presidential clap.
[01:56:52.168 --> 01:56:59.791]  How are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do, you hand it over to the Republicans, 142.
[01:56:59.991 --> 01:57:01.011]  How is that good?
[01:57:01.951 --> 01:57:04.272]  I mean, how is that good?
[01:57:04.592 --> 01:57:07.453]  If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't be too happy about that number.
[01:57:08.014 --> 01:57:09.754]  And we'll have a record number of judges.
[01:57:10.274 --> 01:57:14.777]   By the time Our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20.
[01:57:14.817 --> 01:57:19.300]  I'm only kidding.
[01:57:22.942 --> 01:57:27.846]  I'm only kidding because every time I do that, they say, see, he's assuming control.
[01:57:29.347 --> 01:57:31.188]  We have this crazy guy on television.
[01:57:31.208 --> 01:57:31.688]  If only.
[01:57:31.708 --> 01:57:34.530]  And he goes, you know, he's talking to a guest.
[01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:37.072]  He goes, you know, he's going to win, don't you?
[01:57:37.292 --> 01:57:38.553]  You know, he's going to win.
[01:57:40.191 --> 01:57:41.452]  I mean, we've done a good job.
[01:57:41.472 --> 01:57:42.213]  He should be happy.
[01:57:43.034 --> 01:57:47.499]  But he said, our military, our schools, our this, everything.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.942]  He says, you know, he's going to win.
[01:57:50.362 --> 01:57:52.945]  And the guest goes, well, no, we're going to fight.
[01:57:52.985 --> 01:57:53.626]  We're going to fight.
[01:57:53.686 --> 01:57:53.906]  No, no.
[01:57:54.987 --> 01:57:55.688]  He's going to win.
[01:57:56.008 --> 01:57:59.712]  And you know, Leanne, you think the president has a governor on his rhetoric tonight?
[01:57:59.952 --> 01:58:01.054]  What do you think he's holding back?
[01:58:01.724 --> 01:58:02.244]  I'm not sure.
[01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:08.745]  I mean, he just keeps pointing there to the media saying, I'm not going to say it because they'll spin it like this and spin it like that.
[01:58:08.805 --> 01:58:15.347]  And it's just the stuff that does make it out onto his Twitter and into the letters he sends to Erdogan.
[01:58:15.367 --> 01:58:17.287]  Don't be a tough guy.
[01:58:17.327 --> 01:58:17.967]  Don't be a fool.
[01:58:18.007 --> 01:58:18.687]  Don't be a fool.
[01:58:18.707 --> 01:58:23.708]  And then BBC says, Erdogan trashes the letter Trump sent him.
[01:58:23.728 --> 01:58:24.589]  Well, what did he expect?
[01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:25.629]  What did you want him to frame it?
[01:58:25.809 --> 01:58:27.849]  Was he supposed to like burn it in a seance?
[01:58:27.869 --> 01:58:29.650]  President Trump told me not to be a fool.
[01:58:32.364 --> 01:58:38.388]  One of the first things President Trump said tonight is something he's never said before, and that's that the Democrats do not love our country.
[01:58:38.408 --> 01:58:42.751]  He always says, sometimes it seems as though they might not love our country with what they're doing.
[01:58:43.051 --> 01:58:44.472]  Today he just said they don't love America.
[01:58:44.492 --> 01:58:53.379]  Yeah, they're getting... Maybe he'll next, he'll go, you know, sometimes it seems like these Democrats are devil-possessed, and then like in a year he'll be like, these Democrats are possessed by the devil!
[01:58:54.875 --> 01:58:57.396]  Well, they're finally starting to get honest with their messaging.
[01:58:57.436 --> 01:59:05.119]  They're not pretending they don't want to take away your guns and do away with the right to religion.
[01:59:05.679 --> 01:59:08.660]  I think Nancy Pelosi shape-shifted into Baphomet today.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:10.841]  I saw you tweet that out.
[01:59:10.861 --> 01:59:11.741]  That was real.
[01:59:11.781 --> 01:59:12.581]  That was not doctored.
[01:59:13.381 --> 01:59:15.242]  Apologize for America.
[01:59:15.262 --> 01:59:16.402]  You've seen it many times.
[01:59:16.422 --> 01:59:17.783]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:59:20.145 --> 01:59:27.824]   Now you have a president who's standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas.
[01:59:27.824 --> 01:59:33.504]  [Applause]
[01:59:33.504 --> 01:59:42.545]   You must never forget the 2020 election is about one thing, and it's coming up fast.
[01:59:42.764 --> 01:59:43.565]  It's about you.
[01:59:43.585 --> 01:59:44.606]  It's about you.
[01:59:44.926 --> 01:59:45.787]  One thing about you.
[01:59:47.065 --> 01:59:47.806]  I'm doing this for you.
[01:59:47.966 --> 01:59:53.091]  You know, we had, in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election.
[01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:54.593]  I guess George Washington was good.
[01:59:56.314 --> 01:59:57.115]  But that was easy.
[01:59:58.156 --> 02:00:02.100]  And by the way, he did even better, percentage-wise, in judges than I did.
[02:00:02.701 --> 02:00:03.502]  He had 100%.
[02:00:05.644 --> 02:00:06.245]  But we could have 50%.
[02:00:06.925 --> 02:00:07.586]  That's not bad.
[02:00:07.846 --> 02:00:09.047]  And I had many more than he had.
[02:00:12.335 --> 02:00:15.157]  So I guess you gotta give George Washington, what do you think, Ted?
[02:00:15.177 --> 02:00:16.298]  You gotta give him something.
[02:00:16.898 --> 02:00:18.119]  I'd say honesty.
[02:00:18.139 --> 02:00:25.945]  So tomorrow night on CNN, or probably right now, Trump says he's a better president than George Washington.
[02:00:27.306 --> 02:00:30.469]  No, because then CNN would have to admit George Washington was great.
[02:00:30.829 --> 02:00:35.612]  Trump finally gets them to admit.
[02:00:35.933 --> 02:00:37.714]  Founders were great.
[02:00:37.794 --> 02:00:40.036]  Trump trolls CNN into admitting America's great.
[02:00:41.966 --> 02:00:43.267]  Man, Trump just needs to come out.
[02:00:43.287 --> 02:00:45.648]  America was great!
[02:00:46.228 --> 02:00:55.912]  If Trump just comes out and says, America sucks, I hate this country, the next day Nancy Pelosi will be like, how dare the president say such bad things about the greatest country on earth?
[02:00:59.253 --> 02:00:59.393]  Now 9.05.
[02:01:00.394 --> 02:01:10.598]  With your help, we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity.
[02:01:11.248 --> 02:01:19.248]   Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful
[02:01:19.248 --> 02:01:28.568]  system of immigration.
[02:01:28.568 --> 02:01:32.228]   And by the way, thank you, Robert Jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this
[02:01:32.228 --> 02:01:35.888]  massive—wherever you are, Robert, where is he?
[02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:38.648]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:41.720]  He got up, he started saying, he may not be the greatest person.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.921]  I said, this is like four years ago.
[02:01:44.141 --> 02:01:45.762]  I see this guy, what a mouthpiece he's got.
[02:01:47.904 --> 02:01:48.944]  And he's a man of God.
[02:01:49.465 --> 02:01:51.026]  And he said, he may not be the greatest.
[02:01:52.667 --> 02:01:54.728]  He may not be the most perfect Christian.
[02:01:55.668 --> 02:02:00.551]  He may not know the Bible as well as some of us, but he's a leader.
[02:02:01.072 --> 02:02:02.232]  And I love Donald Trump.
[02:02:02.312 --> 02:02:03.153]  I said, who is that guy?
[02:02:03.193 --> 02:02:03.773]  I love that guy.
[02:02:03.972 --> 02:02:05.972]  Robert Jeffries.
[02:02:05.972 --> 02:02:07.972]  [Applause]
[02:02:07.972 --> 02:02:09.972]  [Cheering]
[02:02:09.972 --> 02:02:11.972]  [Applause]
[02:02:11.972 --> 02:02:13.972]  He's a great guy.
[02:02:14.824 --> 02:02:18.427]  Got a big, big group of people on Sunday mornings too, I can tell you.
[02:02:19.888 --> 02:02:31.077]  We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, I love it, made in the USA.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:47.369]  We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years.
[02:02:47.389 --> 02:02:48.269]  We're doing that.
[02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:50.791]  Who would have believed we could do that?
[02:02:50.831 --> 02:02:51.532]  We're doing that.
[02:02:52.472 --> 02:02:56.895]  And the previous administration spent no money on that, and we're spending a lot.
[02:02:57.096 --> 02:02:57.736]  But think of that.
[02:02:57.856 --> 02:02:58.617]  Who would have thought that?
[02:02:58.817 --> 02:03:02.840]  We're going to end, within 10 years, the AIDS epidemic in our country.
[02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:04.641]  Who would have thought we'd advance that far?
[02:03:06.623 --> 02:03:15.623]   We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:03:15.623 --> 02:03:22.623]  [Applause]
[02:03:22.623 --> 02:03:29.363]   Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great
[02:03:29.363 --> 02:03:30.623]  state of Texas.
[02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:32.009]  This is a great state.
[02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:38.344]  We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:03:38.704 --> 02:03:43.770]  We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.
[02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:52.330]  Thank you.
[02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:55.850]  We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.
[02:03:55.850 --> 02:04:05.850]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:03:57.230 --> 02:04:05.758]  We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society.
[02:04:10.583 --> 02:04:17.950]  We believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and American independence.
[02:04:21.079 --> 02:04:27.559]   We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and
[02:04:27.559 --> 02:04:31.960]  always respect our great American flag.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:38.840]  (Applause)
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:45.479]   Loyal citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back this country,
[02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:47.631]  We love our country.
[02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:51.113]  We're returning power to you, the American people.
[02:04:50.972 --> 02:04:57.972]  That's what we've done.
[02:04:57.972 --> 02:05:04.572]   From Dallas to El Paso, from Houston to Austin, from the Red River to the Rio Grande.
[02:05:05.478 --> 02:05:13.421]  This state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:25.840]   Texas. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:30.400]  made their last stand at the Alamo.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.400]  [Applause]
[02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:37.789]   This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzales,
[02:05:37.789 --> 02:05:45.630]   armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign army and declared, "Come and take it!"
[02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:56.588]  Come and take it, Robert Francis O'Rourke.
[02:05:56.791 --> 02:05:58.592]  Come and take it.
[02:05:58.612 --> 02:05:59.893]  Well, he's not going to come and take it.
[02:06:00.834 --> 02:06:01.775]  Well, he has a 0% chance.
[02:06:01.795 --> 02:06:03.816]  Law enforcement to come and do it.
[02:06:03.996 --> 02:06:06.698]  Well, he has a 0% chance of having law enforcement do it either.
[02:06:06.718 --> 02:06:13.884]  Because he's pretty sure that potential mass murderers will comply with Beto in his furry suit.
[02:06:14.524 --> 02:06:23.010]  You know, if you look at his early writings, he wrote that he, in some sort of alter ego perhaps, he said he wanted to kill 30 people by the time he was 23.
[02:06:23.751 --> 02:06:26.653]  So, he has a good insight into the mind of a serial killer.
[02:06:29.855 --> 02:06:31.217]  They didn't have a lot of money.
[02:06:32.739 --> 02:06:34.262]  They didn't have a lot of luxury.
[02:06:35.203 --> 02:06:37.527]  But they all had one thing in common.
[02:06:37.927 --> 02:06:39.149]  They loved their families.
[02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:40.712]  They loved their country.
[02:06:40.872 --> 02:06:43.512]  and they loved their God.
[02:06:43.512 --> 02:06:48.311]  [Applause]
[02:06:48.311 --> 02:06:54.391]   These courageous Texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears
[02:06:54.391 --> 02:06:59.431]   so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy,
[02:06:59.431 --> 02:07:05.112]   demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud American heritage.
[02:07:05.286 --> 02:07:08.687]  We will never, ever allow that to happen.
[02:07:12.711 --> 02:07:18.812]  With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working.
[02:07:19.292 --> 02:07:21.192]  We are going to keep on fighting.
[02:07:21.593 --> 02:07:25.393]  And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
[02:07:29.954 --> 02:07:37.455]  We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
[02:07:41.136 --> 02:07:46.433]   And together, We will make America wealthy again.
[02:07:49.215 --> 02:07:52.658]  We will make America proud again.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.742]  We will make America strong again.
[02:08:00.663 --> 02:08:04.086]  We will make America safe again.
[02:08:06.644 --> 02:08:11.788]  And we will make America great again.
[02:08:12.148 --> 02:08:13.169]  Thank you, Texas.
[02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:14.250]  Thank you.
[02:08:17.272 --> 02:08:28.220]  Wow.
[02:08:28.661 --> 02:08:30.202]  What a rally from President Trump.
[02:08:30.762 --> 02:08:32.204]  Energy is still on high.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:41.102]  Uh, you're talking 30,000 plus at this event, at least 20,000 in the arena, at least 5 to 10 outside.
[02:08:41.162 --> 02:08:42.063]  The numbers I'm hearing are 30,000.
[02:08:42.743 --> 02:08:45.884]  Uh, a great rally from President Trump, high energy.
[02:08:46.224 --> 02:08:47.844]  I don't know how he maintains his energy level.
[02:08:47.864 --> 02:08:49.385]  He has to be... He's like 73 now?
[02:08:49.705 --> 02:08:51.965]  He has to be on turbo force from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:51.985 --> 02:08:52.766]  There's just no way.
[02:08:52.786 --> 02:08:56.727]  Uh, but, but, uh, let's get some commentary here post...
[02:08:57.955 --> 02:09:01.256]  Rally President Trump in Dallas, a historical rally indeed.
[02:09:01.696 --> 02:09:03.216]  Let's go to Tom Pappert.
[02:09:03.897 --> 02:09:04.957]  Tom, sum it up for us.
[02:09:05.937 --> 02:09:13.699]  So that was truly, I mean, Trump rallies, some say if you've seen one you've seen them all, but on every single rally he always tends to introduce something new.
[02:09:13.759 --> 02:09:23.062]  So some of the highlights for that one, as I said a moment ago, that's the first time to my knowledge President Trump has ever said that the Democrats, the globalists, do not love our country.
[02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:28.082]   Normally he hedges it, saying it seems as if they're doing it to hurt America.
[02:09:28.082 --> 02:09:33.282]   He mentioned, interestingly, that he thought after the 2016 election he would finally be
[02:09:33.282 --> 02:09:37.682]   respected by the media, and says it's, of course, worse now than ever.
[02:09:37.682 --> 02:09:43.442]   I really enjoyed, though, the end of the catastrophic Middle Eastern wars rhetoric.
[02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:48.841]   I mean, of course, President Trump is raising some eyebrows as he sends more troops to,
[02:09:48.841 --> 02:09:53.442]   I believe, Saudi Arabia, even as he removes them from Syria, but I think that putting
[02:09:53.442 --> 02:09:58.881]   this rhetoric into the mainstream is very good and very healthy for this country.
[02:09:58.901 --> 02:10:04.445]  It's also fascinating to hear him describe the fighting between Turkey and the Kurds.
[02:10:04.485 --> 02:10:07.487]  You know, sometimes you just got to let them fight like kids.
[02:10:08.107 --> 02:10:09.188]  A little tough love.
[02:10:09.228 --> 02:10:12.591]  American soldiers do not need to be at the center of this.
[02:10:13.011 --> 02:10:18.896]  Then I also found it fascinating, Owen, he spent the most time talking about Biden.
[02:10:18.936 --> 02:10:23.219]  And of course, that is likely because of this Ukraine scandal and the impeachment push.
[02:10:23.599 --> 02:10:29.784]  But then Beto being in Texas and then Elizabeth Warren only mentioning Hillary Clinton once.
[02:10:30.064 --> 02:10:35.709]  So if the crooked one should decide to run, it sounds like he's saving all his ammunition.
[02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:42.714]  By the way, not only did you have 30,000 at a Trump rally tonight, you had a Trump march in Las Vegas that had huge turnout.
[02:10:42.954 --> 02:10:46.856]  You had a Trump rally just organically in D.C.
[02:10:47.377 --> 02:10:48.337]  that happened as well.
[02:10:48.457 --> 02:10:56.403]  So, I mean, big, big ups right now in momentum category for President Trump as we're really, I mean, 2020 has come early.
[02:10:56.663 --> 02:10:57.744]  Leanne, what do you think about that?
[02:10:58.024 --> 02:10:59.264]  Yeah, that's what I was saying earlier.
[02:10:59.324 --> 02:11:01.905]  There's a lot of people are showing up for President Trump.
[02:11:01.925 --> 02:11:09.347]  They're saying, look, you're trying to say that the polls are saying one thing and we are showing up telling you that your polls are off.
[02:11:09.947 --> 02:11:10.908]  It's skewed.
[02:11:10.968 --> 02:11:11.848]  It's fake news.
[02:11:12.528 --> 02:11:19.208]   And, you know, you can see the energy there with President Trump and on all of of the people that were there to stand up for him and to
[02:11:19.208 --> 02:11:21.809]   show up for him, just tons of energy.
[02:11:21.809 --> 02:11:26.208]   People used to faint when Barack Obama would have a rally or give a speech.
[02:11:26.208 --> 02:11:28.649]  People would just be so bored they'd just fall over.
[02:11:28.649 --> 02:11:32.688]   Remember, then that became a big meme that the women were just fainting over Barack Obama.
[02:11:32.688 --> 02:11:37.208]   But really, it's because, I mean, they were bored to death, essentially.
[02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:40.208]  But you know, that's what I, there's just a lot of energy.
[02:11:40.222 --> 02:11:53.993]  If you took all of the Democrats running for president right now and you put them all in a stadium, the crowd size would not even compare at all to what was there for Trump tonight.
[02:11:54.053 --> 02:12:00.758]  Also, didn't Obama, I'm trying to remember, didn't they stage some deal where Obama was giving a speech and some lady collapsed right next to him?
[02:12:00.899 --> 02:12:01.579]  And then he had to go.
[02:12:01.599 --> 02:12:04.662]  And he was like, oh, I gotcha, mama, I gotcha.
[02:12:05.455 --> 02:12:06.215]  Don't you worry, mama.
[02:12:06.675 --> 02:12:06.895]  Yeah.
[02:12:07.375 --> 02:12:10.076]  He's just ladies fainting over Barack Obama.
[02:12:10.256 --> 02:12:10.556]  Yes.
[02:12:10.796 --> 02:12:14.577]  Well, and ironically, that happens quite frequently at Trump rallies.
[02:12:14.657 --> 02:12:18.638]  It's happened during a rally that I was at, and it was completely organic, and it's not out of boredom.
[02:12:18.678 --> 02:12:30.280]  I mean, these women, some of them in their 50s or 60s, sometimes older, will be on the floor, standing room only, screaming at the top of their lungs, make America great again, fake news, CNN sucks.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.123]  And it gets hot down there, they pass out, and you get a doctor involved.
[02:12:35.163 --> 02:12:39.205]  And they're literally outside waiting for hours on end, if not 24 hours.
[02:12:39.225 --> 02:12:41.146]  They don't eat, they don't drink anything.
[02:12:41.166 --> 02:12:43.107]  And this is the dedication.
[02:12:43.728 --> 02:12:48.790]  But, I mean, the Democrats know what's going on here.
[02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:50.051]  They know their polls are fake.
[02:12:50.291 --> 02:12:54.234]  So they see this rally and they're just in total panic mode right now.
[02:12:56.055 --> 02:13:01.039]  You know, there's some other developments that are happening, I think, right now in Dallas that I can't confirm or deny.
[02:13:01.079 --> 02:13:03.000]  So we're going to wait until tomorrow to see what happens.
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:07.243]  But there may have been some planned leftist violence, actually, and some arrests made.
[02:13:07.604 --> 02:13:08.564]  I can't confirm that yet.
[02:13:08.645 --> 02:13:10.546]  We're going to wait and see if that surfaces tomorrow.
[02:13:11.367 --> 02:13:13.528]  But we did have Alex Jones live down there.
[02:13:13.608 --> 02:13:18.412]  There'll be tons of that footage coming out at InfoWars.com tomorrow and Banned.Video.
[02:13:19.052 --> 02:13:22.314]  I look forward to hearing Alex back in studio live tomorrow.
[02:13:22.554 --> 02:13:25.395]  Of course it all kicks off with David Knight in the morning at 8 a.m.
[02:13:25.815 --> 02:13:31.218]  at Infowars.com slash show and band dot video and it rolls right on through till 6 p.m.
[02:13:31.238 --> 02:13:32.918]  with myself and the war room.
[02:13:33.019 --> 02:13:39.621]  So this is what we're doing at Infowars folks and it's literally all thanks to you supporting us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:39.682 --> 02:13:44.309]   Unfortunately, But this is what the Democrats and the Chinese are engaged in right now.
[02:13:45.089 --> 02:13:48.130]  Unfortunately, we get censored on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:49.410]  We can't put our live streams up.
[02:13:49.991 --> 02:13:53.772]  But thanks to you supporting us at InfoWarsStore.com, your steadfastness.
[02:13:54.212 --> 02:13:55.892]  We're still at InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:13:55.932 --> 02:14:10.639]   We've launched Bandot video where you can get all of our content and more content, too, with others like Tom Pappert on there with Will Johnson, Firepower and other great hosts and commentators like Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett and John Bowne and We got more coming.
[02:14:10.699 --> 02:14:15.469]  So, Tom, before we let you go, what's coming next on your docket?
[02:14:15.509 --> 02:14:16.571]  What's on the national file?
[02:14:17.961 --> 02:14:19.742]  Well, I don't want to ruin anything.
[02:14:19.762 --> 02:14:28.344]  We're working on a couple fascinating stories unfolding who else might have relations through energy companies or otherwise with Ukraine.
[02:14:28.645 --> 02:14:31.786]  And, of course, we discuss usually everything, all the major stories.
[02:14:31.866 --> 02:14:41.229]  We write every single night on Firepower, which you can find on Band.Video, an hour after the War Room, every single night from 7 until 9 p.m.
[02:14:42.609 --> 02:14:53.887]  With me and the wonderful Will Johnson, who is helping keep Alex Jones, the general in this meme army, safe and sound in the battle tank tonight in Dallas.
[02:14:54.901 --> 02:14:55.801]  Literally the battle tank.
[02:14:55.841 --> 02:14:56.422]  All right, Tom.
[02:14:57.082 --> 02:14:57.522]  Oh, man.
[02:14:57.602 --> 02:15:01.244]  Who is Tom, with the national file, going to get tomorrow tied into Ukraine?
[02:15:01.644 --> 02:15:05.926]  I think it's either going to be, I'm going to take a wild guess, Mitt Romney or Chuck Schumer.
[02:15:06.026 --> 02:15:06.326]  I don't know.
[02:15:06.406 --> 02:15:07.026]  I really don't know.
[02:15:07.126 --> 02:15:07.967]  I'm really just guessing.
[02:15:08.207 --> 02:15:12.569]  You'll have to check the national file or Tom Papert on with Will Johnson later.
[02:15:12.609 --> 02:15:14.069]  Tom, thank you so much.
[02:15:14.089 --> 02:15:14.750]  Godspeed, friend.
[02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:16.410]  Thank you.
[02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:17.311]  Great show, Will.
[02:15:17.351 --> 02:15:18.251]  Thanks for having me with you.
[02:15:18.651 --> 02:15:18.951]  All right.
[02:15:19.312 --> 02:15:20.172]  Leanne, final comments?
[02:15:21.471 --> 02:15:21.811]  I don't know.
[02:15:21.831 --> 02:15:22.853]  Make America Great Again.
[02:15:22.913 --> 02:15:23.974]  Everybody's gotta show up.
[02:15:24.034 --> 02:15:26.056]  You can't just... Yeah, I'm not Will, by the way.
[02:15:26.116 --> 02:15:27.638]  You know, Tom... Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:15:27.718 --> 02:15:29.200]  I've gotta scold Tom Pappard.
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.000]  How dare you?
[02:15:31.082 --> 02:15:32.603]  I just thought I saw dreadlocks.
[02:15:32.683 --> 02:15:33.304]  I'm so sorry.
[02:15:33.324 --> 02:15:33.484]  I know.
[02:15:33.504 --> 02:15:34.846]  All of us black people look alike.
[02:15:34.906 --> 02:15:35.767]  Way to go, racist.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:41.946]  Yeah, I guess that's at least a good argument for being colorblind because you and Will could be the same person.
[02:15:41.986 --> 02:15:43.128]  Now, I apologize.
[02:15:43.328 --> 02:15:46.131]  Owen, a war room every single day.
[02:15:46.151 --> 02:15:47.093]  Hey, it's been a long day.
[02:15:47.133 --> 02:15:49.596]  I've only been on air for like seven hours or something.
[02:15:49.676 --> 02:15:50.617]  Alright, alright, Tom.
[02:15:50.897 --> 02:15:51.418]  Get out of here.
[02:15:51.478 --> 02:15:52.199]  Go get some sleep.
[02:15:52.239 --> 02:15:53.280]  You'll be back on tomorrow.
[02:15:53.721 --> 02:15:54.381]  Sorry, Leanne.
[02:15:54.422 --> 02:15:55.202]  You were cut off.
[02:15:55.243 --> 02:15:55.523]  Go ahead.
[02:15:55.643 --> 02:15:57.485]  Yeah, I'm just saying, people gotta show up.
[02:15:57.825 --> 02:16:05.312]  It's one thing to show up in numbers at the rallies, but it's a whole other thing to get your butt to the voting booth, and that's what people really need to do.
[02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:12.638]  And you know, you were saying too, like, the whole Democrat Party could have a rally and they could market it and put every candidate, they still wouldn't get half that crowd.
[02:16:13.279 --> 02:16:21.005]  How can they convince, and this is the crazy thing too, it's like they really have this weird brainwashing on the public where somehow the television is more important than reality.
[02:16:21.966 --> 02:16:26.487]  If you can't get people energized to go to a Democrat event, you really think they're going to go vote for you?
[02:16:26.887 --> 02:16:38.629]  Right, and I forget who it was, but she was basically calling out Beyonce, saying, why doesn't Beyonce, she's got, you know, 40 million fans or whatever, why doesn't she tell every single one of her fans to go and vote?
[02:16:38.949 --> 02:16:39.749]  Then we would win.
[02:16:39.849 --> 02:16:45.871]  And it's like, did you not see where not only Beyonce, but also her husband, Jay-Z, had the concert?
[02:16:46.311 --> 02:16:47.211]  LeBron James.
[02:16:47.871 --> 02:16:54.498]  Like, they did tell all of their, but that's not, that doesn't translate to people wanting to go and vote for a candidate.
[02:16:54.578 --> 02:16:56.660]  Just because their favorite rapper likes them.
[02:16:56.941 --> 02:16:57.621]  Do you hear that?
[02:16:59.203 --> 02:17:00.504]  Does anybody else hear that?
[02:17:00.745 --> 02:17:02.747]  There's some soft whimpering in the background.
[02:17:03.407 --> 02:17:07.572]  Oh, that's Joe Biden because Obama endorsed Trudeau, but not him.
[02:17:08.524 --> 02:17:09.224]  That's right.
[02:17:09.564 --> 02:17:10.565]  Aw, poor little Joe.
[02:17:10.585 --> 02:17:15.847]  He actually said he really enjoyed working with Trudeau and just total... Seriously though... Frickets on Biden.
[02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:22.850]  Obama not endorsing Biden really makes you wonder what's coming because he's holding out his endorsement for someone.
[02:17:23.130 --> 02:17:23.630]  You think so?
[02:17:24.371 --> 02:17:24.811]  Oh yeah.
[02:17:26.064 --> 02:17:32.668]  I think it's like Joe Biden, you know, the synapses are not firing right in the brain.
[02:17:33.068 --> 02:17:34.649]  He's had multiple strokes.
[02:17:34.849 --> 02:17:37.431]  Cutting, clipping coupons at the stock market.
[02:17:37.451 --> 02:17:38.511]  You don't clip coupons?
[02:17:38.871 --> 02:17:39.512]  At the stock market?
[02:17:39.552 --> 02:17:39.772]  On the 17th?
[02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:44.494]  I was like, maybe that's just a stock market term.
[02:17:44.554 --> 02:17:45.014]  I don't know.
[02:17:45.094 --> 02:17:45.534]  No, it's not.
[02:17:45.614 --> 02:17:46.014]  I'm not.
[02:17:46.214 --> 02:17:48.635]  They put their coupons and they ring the bell.
[02:17:48.975 --> 02:17:49.415]  I don't know.
[02:17:49.716 --> 02:17:51.756]  But it just.
[02:17:51.796 --> 02:17:52.216]  No, no.
[02:17:52.757 --> 02:18:01.199]  Obama, working alongside Biden for so long, probably had already started to see some of that brain not firing correctly.
[02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:04.020]  So for him, he's like, you know, Joe, don't run.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:05.941]  He did it anyway.
[02:18:06.121 --> 02:18:09.782]  Creepy uncle, grandpa, cousin, lover Joe.
[02:18:10.666 --> 02:18:12.612]  Cuddly old Joe Biden.
[02:18:13.635 --> 02:18:14.838]  Would you get in a phone booth with Joe?
[02:18:17.202 --> 02:18:18.762]  All right, we'll just leave it at that.
[02:18:18.862 --> 02:18:22.483]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a big shout out to the audience for tuning in.
[02:18:22.523 --> 02:18:23.343]  Thank you guys so much.
[02:18:23.383 --> 02:18:25.284]  Big shout out to the crew that's been here all day.
[02:18:25.924 --> 02:18:26.964]  Big love to you guys.
[02:18:27.724 --> 02:18:30.064]  Thanks to everybody for supporting us at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:18:30.084 --> 02:18:31.185]  Don't forget about the big specials.
[02:18:31.225 --> 02:18:33.665]  We have free shipping right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:18:34.065 --> 02:18:36.426]  Don't end up like a Joe Biden that can't speak clearly.
[02:18:36.686 --> 02:18:37.866]  Get yourself some brain force.
[02:18:38.146 --> 02:18:39.126]  Be like President Trump.
[02:18:39.426 --> 02:18:40.406]  Drink the turbo force.
[02:18:40.546 --> 02:18:41.427]  Have dragon energy.
[02:18:41.667 --> 02:18:43.087]  It's all at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:18:43.527 --> 02:18:44.368]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.
[02:18:44.428 --> 02:18:45.309]  David Knight, 8am.
[02:18:45.389 --> 02:18:46.329]  Alex Jones, 11am.
[02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:47.170]  I'll be live at 3.
[02:18:47.851 --> 02:18:48.611]  Keep kicking ass.
[02:18:48.631 --> 02:18:49.712]  You stay classy, America.
[02:18:49.732 --> 02:18:50.893]  InfoWars.
[02:18:50.933 --> 02:18:52.234]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:18:52.113 --> 02:19:04.234]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:19:04.234 --> 02:19:11.433]   I have warned viewers and listeners of the InfoWars that there are times in history when
[02:19:11.433 --> 02:19:14.792]  everything starts to ignite.
[02:19:15.424 --> 02:19:19.327]  Good things accelerate, bad things accelerate.
[02:19:20.327 --> 02:19:24.970]  People awaken, but also other people dig in and become more evil and more corrupt.
[02:19:25.330 --> 02:19:29.992]  Many people give up on humanity and decide to serve evil because finally they want some power.
[02:19:31.353 --> 02:19:34.655]  Then they find out they're nothing more than slaves, trapped by the evil.
[02:19:34.995 --> 02:19:36.176]  At least they believe so.
[02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.929]  But with U.S.
[02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:55.018]  Special Forces getting killed in Syria and the acceleration of the impeachment against President Trump and the coming out of all of the different pedophile rings, one of the sexualized children, the admissions that babies are being kept alive and their organs being harvested.
[02:19:56.859 --> 02:19:59.300]  We're living in really important times.
[02:20:00.121 --> 02:20:02.842]  You know, it's an old Chinese proverb, may you live in interesting times.
[02:20:04.966 --> 02:20:06.068]  Most Chinese were farmers.
[02:20:06.228 --> 02:20:07.851]  They didn't want any trouble.
[02:20:08.252 --> 02:20:10.016]  So something good could turn into something bad.
[02:20:10.456 --> 02:20:11.819]  Something bad could turn into something good.
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:14.043]  So it means double-edged sword.
[02:20:14.644 --> 02:20:17.550]  We certainly do live in very, very interesting times.
[02:20:19.019 --> 02:20:21.239]  And we were supposed to be off the air by now.
[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:26.621]  The establishment didn't want us here when they made their big move against Trump in America to still be on air.
[02:20:27.441 --> 02:20:28.701]  We sucker punched him with Trump.
[02:20:29.281 --> 02:20:31.202]  Well, they don't want to be caught off guard this time.
[02:20:31.262 --> 02:20:38.663]  But the truth is they underestimated you and how you've spread the word, how you've prayed for the broadcast, and how you financially supported us.
[02:20:39.263 --> 02:20:45.925]  And we make it really easy to support the Infowar because we have products that support you and your family and your own health.
[02:20:46.345 --> 02:20:54.408]   All of this is about Not laying down to the establishment, and in the process of not laying down to these evil globalists, we get stronger, like lifting weights or going for a jog.
[02:20:54.588 --> 02:21:02.011]  Speaking of getting stronger, we're running a special right now that's part of our InfoWars Everything Must Go special that is one of the biggest sales in our history.
[02:21:02.031 --> 02:21:13.196]  We just keep topping our previous sales, where you can get immune wall, beta, glucans, and olive leaf for $19.95 with a bottle of Silver Bullet high-quality coiled silver.
[02:21:13.356 --> 02:21:14.736]  Both of these together are $19.95.
[02:21:16.437 --> 02:21:19.265]  The normal sale price of Silver Bullet is $19.95.
[02:21:19.546 --> 02:21:20.268]  That's a great deal.
[02:21:20.669 --> 02:21:22.935]  This is the top brand in the country, private label by us.
[02:21:23.953 --> 02:21:32.019]  Then you've got immune wall and all the things that these two compounds do on record to boost your immune system against bacteria, viruses, you name it.
[02:21:32.459 --> 02:21:35.881]  This is what myself and my family take and they're just amazing.
[02:21:36.021 --> 02:21:39.384]  Well, we've got the special combo deal going right now.
[02:21:39.404 --> 02:21:42.586]  360 immune defense combo, limited supply.
[02:21:42.686 --> 02:21:45.428]  We have plenty of the colloidal silver because it always sells out by Christmas.
[02:21:45.548 --> 02:21:52.514]   So we've got a lot of it right now, but we don't have a lot of the immune wall, but I wanted to make it Very, very close to cost.
[02:21:52.855 --> 02:21:54.718]  We're making like six, seven dollars on this combo.
[02:21:55.799 --> 02:22:04.092]  So that you and your family will have a better shot of having a healthy, good Christmas and winter coming up.
[02:22:05.026 --> 02:22:07.528]  Now is the time to get outdoors and exercise.
[02:22:07.588 --> 02:22:10.009]  Now is the time to meditate and, you know, pray.
[02:22:10.569 --> 02:22:12.591]  Now is the time to be politically engaged.
[02:22:12.651 --> 02:22:24.198]  And now is the time to eat healthy, drink a lot of purified water, and take immune wall, beta-glucans, and olive leaf, and to have the cloyal silver for topical or for ingestion and all the great things the cloyal silver does.
[02:22:24.778 --> 02:22:26.179]  This is a very special combo.
[02:22:26.539 --> 02:22:27.760]  I hope you'll take advantage of it.
[02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:30.222]  360 Immune Defense Combo at InfoWarShore.com.
[02:22:30.243 --> 02:22:32.745]  Part of a giant sale we have going right now.
[02:22:32.765 --> 02:22:36.828]  40 to 60% off on more than 50 items.
[02:22:37.068 --> 02:22:41.251]  Again, please take advantage of it today and realize that without you purchasing these products, we won't be here.
[02:22:41.392 --> 02:22:44.394]  Plus, these are great products that fund the InfoWar, so it is a total win.
