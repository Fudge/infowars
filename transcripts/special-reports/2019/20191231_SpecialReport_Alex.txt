[00:00:03.507 --> 00:00:15.830]  This past Sunday, Jack Wilson, a Trump supporter, an American patriot, and the head of security for the North Texas Church, took out a man in less than six seconds after he sadly shot and killed two people.
[00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:19.171]  This individual knew the individuals that he had shot.
[00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.833]  They had helped him out for years as a homeless person that they were trying to rehabilitate.
[00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:25.893]  And we know what happened here.
[00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:31.315]  The media hypes up mass shootings, and they hype up shootings at churches.
[00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:43.432]  And there's so much massive coverage of the shootings, even though statistically they're very rare, that still they're going up because mentally ill people then go out and copycat.
[00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:53.202]   This goes back for more than 100 years in criminology, that if people started jumping off a particular bridge, like The Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:58.307]  That if one person jumped, they'd post more police because they noticed automatically more would come jump.
[00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.209]  Same thing with the Empire State Building.
[00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.671]  If you got one jumper, you might go six months without it.
[00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:08.017]  Once you had one, you might have five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten in the space of a week throw themselves off.
[00:01:08.697 --> 00:01:10.659]  So if one jumped, they would post more police.
[00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:11.640]  This is a fact.
[00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.261]  of human psychology.
[00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.542]  So when the corporate controlled media hypes all this up, they know exactly what they're going to get.
[00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.483]  And that's more of these mass shootings.
[00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:22.304]  But thank God, a good guy with a gun was able to counter this.
[00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:23.904]  But let's look at something else here.
[00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:37.068]   When these mentally ill individuals start showing signs that they're going to do this and start telling people that they're going to go shoot up schools and churches to get attention, Because the media has made that the targets by hyping it up over and over and over again all over the country.
[00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:38.108]  Nothing's done.
[00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.789]  CNN.
[00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.790]  Sheriff says he got 23 calls about Shooter's family but records show more.
[00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.433]  40 plus times that Cruz had the police called on him in Parkland, Florida a year and a half ago saying he was going to kill the people at the school.
[00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.414]   He was known as the school Nothing was done.
[00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:58.033]   The FBI said it failed to act and tip about suspected Florida shooters potential for violence.
[00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.233]   Dayton shooters, chilling notebooks, scrawls reveal he fantasized about hunting humans,
[00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:04.353]  devil worship, told people he was going to do it.
[00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:08.513]   Police were called over and over again, said he was going to shoot up a school or a church
[00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:09.514]  or a nightclub.
[00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:10.514]  Nothing was done.
[00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:14.793]   He was Antifa, a member of Antifa, and did it to help bring down society.
[00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:19.592]   Dayton shooter, Connor Betts, may be Antifa's first mass killer.
[00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:22.568]  Give me a break, they've been attacking ICE facilities with firebombs.
[00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:29.993]  Just this last weekend, a man in Washington State shot and killed his wife and dog to send a message to Trump to ban guns.
[00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:32.374]  A true false flag even confessed to it.
[00:02:32.474 --> 00:02:37.697]  And there's so many other examples where a lieutenant governor told Antifa, don't come down here to El Paso.
[00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:42.760]   And then an Antifa-connected individual, He was into global exterminism of humans to save the Earth.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.183]  He, as well, was connected to Antifa, but they expunged that off of his social media to cover it up.
[00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:50.644]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:52.105]  The examples are legion.
[00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:56.267]  And it goes back to 1999 with Harrison Kleibold and Columbine.
[00:02:56.747 --> 00:02:59.949]  They stand down over and over again because they're ordered to.
[00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.870]  They stood down in Parkland.
[00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.111]  And the examples are legion.
[00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.252]  They're into Satanism.
[00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:06.973]  They're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.413]   that the inserts say can make you be a mass killer, it's proven.
[00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:16.533]   They're into the occult and then nothing's done about them, then the media hypes it up and more people do it.
[00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.731]  They follow an exact profile.
[00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.133]  It's incredible and everyone knows it.
[00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.532]   It's time for the American people to understand more than ever,
[00:03:23.532 --> 00:03:26.533]  good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns.
[00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.933]   And we all have to celebrate the Second Amendment during this time of mass mental illness
[00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:34.133]   as the controlled corporate media tries to foment civil unrest,
[00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:36.133]  breakdown of society and civil war.
[00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:42.596]  They admit that's their plan, because they can't defeat the American system, so they want to overthrow it from within.
[00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:47.158]  Instead, that's how enemies from without always try to do it, is from within.
[00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:51.338]  But we're fighting hard against it on a war footing at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:51.338 --> 00:04:01.458]  So please stand with us into 2020.
[00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:02.539]  My second cup of the day.
[00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.300]  It's really strong, I shouldn't do this.
[00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:07.504]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:08.805]  And the coffee adds to it, but mmm.
