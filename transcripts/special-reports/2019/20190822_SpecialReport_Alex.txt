[00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:04.309]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:05.269]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:06.930]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.812]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:10.713]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:12.575]  That is a f***ing fact.
[00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.177]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.259]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.402]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:24.685]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:27.769]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:33.054]  Alex Jones supported President Trump, but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:38.159]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.462]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:41.193]  Yeah.
[00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.374]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.754]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.615]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:51.616]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:53.856]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.857]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:01.038]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:08.626]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.027]  The government's poisoning the water?
[00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:11.029]  Absolutely.
[00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:19.959]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population to make them more easily manageable.
[00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.801]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one.
[00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.943]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.205]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:30.468]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:33.390]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.274]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.376]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:42.238]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.239]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.760]  It is.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.460]  On and on and on.
[00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.883]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:54.906]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[00:01:56.067 --> 00:02:01.370]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Farooli, developed brain cancer.
[00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.795]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:16.794]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radio frequency or RF waves coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:32.563]  So think about how the LA Times, even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:37.104]   Cell phones operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:40.424]   Now what's a microwave do? It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:45.504]   And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:50.543]   That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:54.463]  You heard me right. 5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:02:54.463 --> 00:03:00.783]   Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:13.911]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:15.952]  What may have happened here?
[00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.114]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:26.099]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:35.645]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.967]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:41.028]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:42.248]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:44.829]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.989]  Years ago.
[00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:53.671]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:55.951]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:57.652]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:04.805]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.356]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:32.654]  What in the world's going on here?
