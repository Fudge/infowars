[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:10.314]  And see, that's the final level of the top of the pyramid, is that, just like the Crips or the Bloods want you to kill somebody, the final level of the pyramid in this is killing children.
[00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:20.558]  And it just came out in Italian newspapers two days ago, that other rich elites are getting busted on islands off the coast of Italy, where they're doing ritual murder.
[00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.100]  Orgies, first it's sex orgies.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.921]  First you go to the island and have sex with a bunch of hot hookers.
[00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:27.858]  Then it's a 16-year-old.
[00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.459]  Then it's a 14-year-old.
[00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:30.819]  Then it's a 12-year-old.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.742]  Then, oh, this person's talking, we're gonna have to kill him, you're involved, you're gonna have to help us dispose of the body.
[00:00:40.983 --> 00:00:41.643]  InfoWars.
[00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:47.585]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:50.996]  Well, we have a ton to talk about.
[00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:57.939]  But first off, I want to say, I don't know that that's true about anyone mentioned, because you were on one of the Change My Minds, and we ran some of that, and we've had you on since.
[00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.939]  And I don't think YouTube is banned.
[00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.642]  I mean, maybe we're just fortunate, but obviously I know that they've been after you, and you've been public enemy number one with them, but we don't really care.
[00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.604]  I mean, we care for you, but we don't really care what they do.
[00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:10.064]  It's Facebook.
[00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:10.684]  It's Facebook.
[00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.725]  It's Facebook that's been doing the total blackout.
[00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.386]  And sure, they let me get on Joe Rogan.
[00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:16.327]  He talked to YouTube before.
[00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:16.967]  They said fine.
[00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:19.168]  Because you're big enough, you're respected enough.
[00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:24.970]  But a lot of the smaller shows and things that I've gone on have gotten strikes because they don't have a big enough name.
[00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.752]  Take the guy that uploaded the video of Chris Cuomo blowing up in New York.
[00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:34.834]  Well, they took his video down until there was an outcry.
[00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:35.854]  They put the video back up.
[00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:40.956]  So I think it's because you've got enough clout and a big fan base that supports you that you're still here, my friend.
[00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:43.537]  I mean, as you know, they've been working around the clock to take you off.
[00:01:43.777 --> 00:01:44.398]  Yes, I do.
[00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:45.939]  I don't know about clout or respect.
[00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.100]  Fan base, I appreciate.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.381]  But I'm certainly not respected in the halls of Google.
[00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.023]  They've made that no secret.
[00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:56.707]  Before we get into it, I want to talk about Epstein, because obviously this seems, like we said, we want to get Mr. Jones on.
[00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:01.010]  But what's your take on Chris Cuomo and Fredo?
[00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.333]  First off, do you believe that Fredo is as bad as the N-word to Italians?
[00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:05.133]  I'm not sold.
[00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:11.618]  Well, I mean, in fact, I interviewed the fellow that was given the video.
[00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.460]  It's called That's the Point.
[00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:19.029]  With Brandon, and he was given the video by a very wealthy individual, very wealthy family.
[00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:27.201]  It turns out is Italian and just called the guy Fredo because everybody knows that Chris Cuomo is a chump.
[00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.261]  He's the guy that said the Epstein thing shouldn't be investigated.
[00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:35.184]  He's the guy that said if you're re-WikiLeaks, you'll go to jail, but I'm allowed to.
[00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:43.390]  He's the guy that said if your 11-year-old daughter doesn't want to be in the shower with a transgendered woman with large genitals, large male genitals, that she's bad.
[00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.913]  So... Well, wait, why does the large matter when it comes to transgendered genitals?
[00:02:47.953 --> 00:02:49.614]  If they're genitals, that's enough.
[00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:51.296]  Exactly.
[00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:57.340]  But expanding on that, this is the guy that's always blowing up at people, always threatening, and new video has surfaced.
[00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.134]  Where he called himself Fredo on TV a decade ago, his dad called him Fredo.
[00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.815]  So we now know what this means.
[00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:09.758]  He's the dumb son compared to his brother, the governor, who's still pretty bad.
[00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:11.119]  America has never been that great.
[00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.020]  It's not going to be great.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.902]  So this is my view on it.
[00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:16.103]  And I think it's the truth.
[00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:26.471]  They've already said anybody that Trump supports, or anybody that supports Trump, or anybody that wants to keep their guns, or anybody that likes capitalism, or anybody that's just right of Mao Zedong or V.I.
[00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.812]  Lenin is a racist.
[00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:32.428]  So by logical extension, if somebody says, Hey Fredo, can I take a picture with you?
[00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:33.528]  Oh, you just attacked me.
[00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:37.210]  I'm an Italian American with a CNN show worth tens of millions of dollars.
[00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.732]  And my brother's the governor and our family's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:45.234]  You know, I've got white privilege, but because I'm Italian, you just put me down.
[00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:45.994]  That's the N word.
[00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:47.535]  So I'm going to throw you down the stairs.
[00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:48.755]  I'm going to wreck you.
[00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.996]  Basically, I'm going to kill you.
[00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.257]  Because you dare joke at a public figure.
[00:03:53.497 --> 00:04:02.681]  It shows the entitlement of these elites, but now wrapping themselves in this new calculus of all Trump supporters are racist, or anyone that disagrees with me is a racist.
[00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.203]  So they've kind of an alchemy now to, oh, well, don't call me any names because that's racist too.
[00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:11.485]  Well, I mean, to be fair, I think it's poor form to call somebody, like, to insult somebody.
[00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.305]  It was meant to be insulting in front of his wife and kid.
[00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.566]  Like, I think that there's sort of these rules of engagement.
[00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.427]  It turns out that's not, that's a lie though.
[00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.088]  His wife and kid weren't there reportedly.
[00:04:19.688 --> 00:04:22.390]  Okay, well, either way, if someone, for example, we talk about Sarah Huckabee being out to dinner.
[00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.391]  Like, I don't like Chris Cuomo.
[00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:28.694]  I call him the DNC pool boy-in-chief just because... And by the way, it sounds like his dad's a d*** if his dad called him a traitor.
[00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:30.535]  It sounds like that guy was setting him up to fail.
[00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:32.316]  He was like, what are you setting me up for, Dad?
[00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:33.597]  Eh, CNN.
[00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:33.877]  Primetime?
[00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:34.198]  Not exactly.
[00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:34.878]  No, I think you're right.
[00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:36.519]  We don't want to become Maxine Waters.
[00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:36.859]  Right.
[00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.240]  When they're getting gas, harass them.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.761]  When they're in the grocery store, harass them.
[00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:40.802]  When they're at the mall, harass them.
[00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:42.659]  I get harassed all the place, so do you.
[00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.582]  That's why I did that joke bit where I walked up and harassed you as a leftist and you were, you know, kind-hearted not to slug me.
[00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.243]  Because you and your dad are both pretty big guys.
[00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:52.845]  But, I mean, I think you're right that overall we don't want to become the left.
[00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:53.966]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:57.028]  And that does not change the fact that he clearly overreacted.
[00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:59.910]  Because I get this kind of stuff all the time and I just say, oh, okay, alright.
[00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.013]  And my rule is I can't let you get within arm's length of me if you're being aggressive.
[00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:04.753]  That's different, you know.
[00:05:04.773 --> 00:05:07.535]  But if someone were to say, hey, I've had people go, hey, Steven, you're a fag.
[00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.117]  Okay, whatever, all right, I take the good with the bad.
[00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:12.760]  Okay, so yeah, Fredo, we get it.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.201]  Chris Cuomo, not a great guy.
[00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:15.323]  I don't think anyone's a fan of him.
[00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:17.705]  And what's crazy about him is his ratings are terrible.
[00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:29.117]  Like nobody, you know what nobody is, what I haven't, I don't imagine, I can't say this, I don't want to say it definitively because this could end up being a permaband, but I don't imagine that anyone has said, you know what I really want to know?
[00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:30.838]  What Chris Cuomo thinks about X.
[00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:42.509]  We have had a lot of people saying, you know what, you should probably get Alex Jones' take on the Epstein saga, because he talked about this and predicted it a while ago.
[00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:51.739]  Now, to be clear, you've talked about sort of this, the pedophile rings and those in power and people who are sexual abuse or sex trafficking, which we know.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.762]  I'm not using the word pedophile rings, but that's really what it is!
[00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:54.402]  It's a pedophile ring!
[00:05:55.263 --> 00:05:57.025]  Let me just give you an open field here.
[00:05:57.265 --> 00:06:00.448]  What's your take on the Epstein issue right now?
[00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:04.871]  First off, do you think that he committed suicide or was he suicided?
[00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:10.716]  Okay, I'm not somebody that thinks he's in the witness protection program.
[00:06:10.816 --> 00:06:17.322]  Most people I see online, when they learn that the cameras were turned off, he was moved out of death watch, he was put in a cell by himself.
[00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:24.857]  And then voila, the body basically disappears and now they're saying we can't hear about the autopsy for some time.
[00:06:24.877 --> 00:06:29.540]  A lot of folks think that he was basically, again, a witness protection program.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.683]  And because we've been lied to so much, people have a right to think that.
[00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:36.204]  People have a right to think he actually committed suicide.
[00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:38.106]  People have a right to think that he was murdered.
[00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:40.007]  But the evidence points towards murder.
[00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.148]  He had this little black book.
[00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.530]  He had all this information at his island.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.543]  Uh, he was reportedly talking about working with the Trump administration and prosecutors.
[00:06:49.964 --> 00:06:51.285]  He was a concierge.
[00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:52.145]  He was a pimp.
[00:06:52.646 --> 00:07:11.740]  And I'll get to that next, but for very powerful, big groups, uh, setting up, uh, these facilities in New Mexico and the Caribbean, and in this huge compound in New York, where people just didn't have sex with underage girls and things, they did all sorts of rituals and drugs and weird eugenics things.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:33.180]   And if people go back to, Documentaries and reports I've done over the last 10 years, well, really 20, but Epstein's name specifically for 10, I explain it's a whole cult religion based on transhumanism and eugenics that's then merged with trauma-based mind control and things developed by the CIA and MI6.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.144]  And the reason I knew about this was I was told by Ted Gunderson, well, let me get to that next.
[00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:48.227]  Let me ask you this real quick, because you mentioned it's a sort of cultish religion, and as a Christian I believe that people can be serving evil without necessarily knowing it.
[00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:53.113]  For example, we hear the greatest trick Satan ever played is making you believe that he doesn't exist, right?
[00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:56.719]  I think he's going to show up in the form of a busty secretary, not a creaky coffin.
[00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:59.020]  Satanists aren't really worshipping Satan.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:11.926]  So when you say that, do you mean they are actually a part of a satanic cult knowingly, or it's just hedonism and serving the flesh and being very selfish, and so it basically manifests itself as this sort of glorified self-religion?
[00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:14.368]  That is exactly right.
[00:08:14.468 --> 00:08:19.290]  And if I have the time, I mean, because anybody that's studied history, you already know all the answers to this, Stephen.
[00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.431]  I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:28.702]   But just getting back to your first question, because I'm already digressing, I don't believe he staged his death, because Dead men tell no tales.
[00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:35.027]  They want to threaten all the other witnesses to show them we can kill him inside a federal jail in New York City.
[00:08:35.507 --> 00:08:36.848]  Nobody can stop us.
[00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:38.429]  So let's go to what I really think happened.
[00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.553]  We know that all the default protections were turned off.
[00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:45.855]  We know that somebody already tried to kill him in the cell.
[00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:47.536]  He had told people that.
[00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:48.597]  That's come out in the news.
[00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:51.179]  So they move him in with somebody else.
[00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:54.300]  Then a few days before, they move him into a cell by himself.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.101]  They take him off suicide watch.
[00:08:56.901 --> 00:09:03.645]  Then, even though there's a camera over the cell, that malfunction, that's now ABC News, NBC News, that's confirmed.
[00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:08.427]  Then they tell all the guards that normally every 30 minutes, go by your cell.
[00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:09.048]  Don't worry about it.
[00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:10.268]  Take off the day early.
[00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:12.029]  They go off an hour early.
[00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:32.244]   Someone who'd never been A worker at that jail, this is CBS News today, was allowed in to the facility and then reportedly, this is now in CBS News and others are reporting it, that people heard screaming and yelling and basically begging for his life as people go into his cell.
[00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:36.407]  Then they start shouting, breathe, breathe, breathe.
[00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:38.728]  Epstein.
[00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:44.871]  Now, a lot of people have obviously speculated what's going on here, but everything is turned off.
[00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:46.791]  All the emergency defaults are turned off.
[00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:48.652]  Then everything is left in the black.
[00:09:49.352 --> 00:10:06.153]   The door opens, two guards go in, and then immediately we hear him screaming and yelling the exact words Uh, where that I have, uh, written down here, uh, was that he was basically begging for his life, screaming and yelling, uh, and howling.
[00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:18.402]  And so during this, you hear breathe, breathe, breathe, it's okay, breathe, which a lot of folks are saying is the cover for when you've got somebody in a chokehold, uh, basically asphyxiating them.
[00:10:18.842 --> 00:10:41.298]   But because this tranche of 2000 documents came out from a lawsuit two days before, Showing all this British royalty, all these big media heads, all these big top Democrats, all these CEOs at Pedophile Island matching the manifest that have come out in federal documents that Dan Bongino and the Secret Service have warned of, saying, you better watch it, Hillary, don't poke the bear.
[00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:43.460]  We know you and Bill were on that airplane.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.742]  Now it's 27 times for Bill alone.
[00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:52.292]   So with that whole waterfront, Going there, these documents come out on a Friday.
[00:10:52.512 --> 00:10:58.040]  I actually had the lawyer, Mark Rondazza, on my show last Friday, broke the documents, said what was in them.
[00:10:59.369 --> 00:11:06.531]  Next morning he's dead, and now it's confirmed 4chan had it 38 minutes before that he was dead from hanging.
[00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:13.532]  So now there's an investigation of that, where 4chan is scooping the New York Times, even in New York City.
[00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.592]  So the whole thing stinks to heaven, and then it gets worse.
[00:11:15.632 --> 00:11:16.833]  But that's not all that odd.
[00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:20.814]  I mean, people online tend to be faster than most mainstream news nowadays.
[00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:21.834]  You've gotten scoops.
[00:11:21.874 --> 00:11:23.254]  We've gotten scoops accidentally.
[00:11:23.274 --> 00:11:24.934]  So I don't know that that means foul play.
[00:11:24.954 --> 00:11:26.895]  It just means that the New York Times sucks at their job.
[00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:27.855]  Oh, sure.
[00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.316]  I wasn't saying that was a foul play.
[00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.138]  I'm just saying it shows the breakdown of the system.
[00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:36.241]  But again, if you look at all the defaults, and there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:41.705]  I was talking to constitutional lawyer and criminal and defense lawyer, Robert Barnes, just yesterday about this.
[00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:50.512]  And if you go through all, there's more than 15 things that are defaults that are done with a high profile person or a suicidal person, like we were told.
[00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:55.426]   that were all turned off, all the defaults. And then he told friends they're trying to kill me.
[00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:59.986]   This is mainstream news. He told people over the telephone, they're trying to kill me,
[00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:03.986]   you got to get me out of here. They're going to kill me. I'm not going to commit suicide.
[00:12:03.986 --> 00:12:10.547]   I didn't try to commit suicide. I was attacked in my jail cell. And so now he's dead. Now,
[00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:13.186]  regardless, it gets worse, Stephen.
[00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:14.688]  I'm jumping at any time, but there's just so much here.
[00:12:14.708 --> 00:12:15.949]  I do have a question, because this is one thing.
[00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:18.251]  First off, I've not heard all the things that you're discussing.
[00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:23.294]  We've talked about sort of the five irrefutable facts yesterday, and we uploaded it to YouTube.
[00:12:23.314 --> 00:12:26.137]  And yes, of course, documents released Friday, dead on a Saturday.
[00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:27.918]  Pedophile Island, the guy got off.
[00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.782]  If you look at the overtime that was paid for some of these guards at his first stint in prison, you know, it was paid by Epstein himself.
[00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:34.844]  There's a paper trail here that is really bad.
[00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:41.529]  That being said, one thing I have not been able to find, and someone can correct, you probably know this, was he in solitary confinement?
[00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:43.695]  Was he supposed to be?
[00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:48.537]  Because it seems like that would be very pertinent information, and I can't find the specifics anywhere.
[00:12:49.297 --> 00:12:53.359]  Yes, I mean, if I was able to pull up my phone here, I could dig that out, because I've been following this very closely.
[00:12:54.339 --> 00:13:00.722]  First, he was a high-profile guy, so they put him in a, they don't call it solitary confinement there, but they call it protective custody, so he's put in a cell.
[00:13:01.142 --> 00:13:12.146]  Then he gets put with another person, who's reportedly quite a big bull, and this guy is what's being said, there's different reports, basically, hurting.
[00:13:12.788 --> 00:13:20.989]  And then he was put on suicide watch because they tried to imply they tried to commit suicide, though he told friends and family that that was not the case.
[00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:21.209]  Right.
[00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:29.431]  And then he was by himself in a jail cell, which you're, again, not supposed to be if you're on suicide watch, because that increases it.
[00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:36.192]  But then they took him out of the suicide watch area and put him into another cell by himself.
[00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:41.973]  And so we're not sure if he had the regular covers and things that are actually made where you could hang yourself.
[00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:46.756]  When the people on Suicide Watch have the type that are like paper, where you can't kill yourself.
[00:13:47.057 --> 00:13:47.197]  Right.
[00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:55.659]  And I think something that's very relevant is, you know, listen, intent really matters here, and it would be interesting to see how much information we have regarding Epstein.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:03.642]  Was his sentiment there, was he enthusiastic about bringing other people down in this ring, saying, listen, I'm going to burn this whole ship down with me?
[00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:07.723]  Or was he a guy who seemed as though he was hopeless, defeated, and wanted to check out?
[00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:14.066]   Because if it's the former, The guy wouldn't commit suicide if you placed a razor blade in his cell because he has a mission to accomplish.
[00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:22.990]  If it's the latter, it's totally reasonable, and everything that I've read seems to insinuate that he wasn't looking to kill himself, but I understand that a lot of that is conjecture.
[00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:33.695]  Well, what friends and family have said in a bunch of news articles is actual quotes, but the media lies so much, you're right, who knows what's true, it is kind of conjecture in the fake news era of the mainstream media.
[00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:37.607]   But they said that He was looking forward to things.
[00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:38.768]  He was settling into life.
[00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:39.869]  He was happy.
[00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.754]  And then they spun that and said, oh, well, he fooled him to put him in an area where he could kill himself.
[00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:53.222]  But the information from CBS News and others that, no, the camera was turned off and that the jail guards go in.
[00:14:53.282 --> 00:14:55.084]  One of the jail guards had never worked there before.
[00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.727]  And then they heard howling and screaming and begging.
[00:14:58.049 --> 00:15:01.070]  And then saying, breathe, Jeffrey Epstein, breathe.
[00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.750]  You can breathe.
[00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.290]  Come on.
[00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.091]  The whole thing is just over the top bizarre, but here's what's even crazier.
[00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:16.273]  It's confirmed that in the last few weeks, all these people pulled boats up to the little pedophile Island and that they flew the drones around his house.
[00:15:16.293 --> 00:15:21.214]  They got video of all these Apple computers and hard drives and things in the windows.
[00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:27.950]  And shots of binoculars and printers and, you know, because people when they're doing computer work want to look out on the ocean like I'm doing right now.
[00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:35.874]  Days before the FBI raided it a few days ago, all of that got pulled because people were droning it every day.
[00:15:36.195 --> 00:15:44.739]  So three days before the FBI raids, someone goes in and pulls all the computers and equipment that can be seen through the windows out of the house.
[00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.321]  So who knew the FBI was coming and who did that?
[00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:49.862]  That is another huge area that needs to be investigated.
[00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:51.563]  Wow, that is pretty.
[00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:54.264]  Now, is that something, is there like a before and after picture that people can see?
[00:15:54.944 --> 00:15:55.764]  There absolutely.
[00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:56.905]  There is a before and after.
[00:15:56.985 --> 00:16:01.206]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com were some of the first to break it.
[00:16:01.246 --> 00:16:10.348]  Drudge Report linked to our article, but it's now out there and have been pretty big, and so you can just pull up those articles for yourself.
[00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:15.710]   Yeah, because one thing I noticed was a sort of, I guess, For lack of a better word, temple on his island that people saw.
[00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:23.013]  I did notice that when you watched, you saw some of the more recent drone footage, a lot of the Pagan iconography had been removed from it, as opposed to if you look at the older ones.
[00:16:23.053 --> 00:16:25.634]  And I want to say, was it like a, was it Poseidon, or was it Medusa?
[00:16:25.654 --> 00:16:29.035]  And then there were these two animal figures, and they were gone in the more recent ones.
[00:16:29.095 --> 00:16:31.216]  You still see that optical illusion of the recessed door.
[00:16:31.817 --> 00:16:35.638]  And it's hard, and this is what I do, right, for a living-ish.
[00:16:35.658 --> 00:16:37.459]  I mean, more, I'm a comedian, but I'm going, okay, hold on a second.
[00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:39.880]  Is there a timeline here as to when this changed?
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.501]  And it seems very difficult to find a lot of this info.
[00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.062]  Exactly.
[00:16:44.382 --> 00:16:48.205]  And that's what we're saying, is that the timeline of the dome being removed.
[00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:49.186]  Right.
[00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:54.070]  And then the creatures of mythology on top and below.
[00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:56.432]  And they went, oh, a hurricane did that.
[00:16:56.512 --> 00:16:58.694]  But then folks checked the timeline of the last hurricane.
[00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:00.816]  No, in fact, a lot of this is recent.
[00:17:01.377 --> 00:17:03.498]  And so, yes, the place is being torn apart.
[00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.801]  The FBI had people with snorkels out in the water looking.
[00:17:07.362 --> 00:17:11.425]  But then when you pull back big picture, Jeffrey Epstein was a concierge.
[00:17:11.705 --> 00:17:12.386]  He was a pimp.
[00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:18.794]   He was a handler. We've tracked his whole history, but the reason this is so important is it's like a
[00:17:18.794 --> 00:17:26.153]   string on a sweater. You pull that string out on that sweater and the whole thing can unravel. So
[00:17:26.153 --> 00:17:33.674]   if you'd like, I can tell folks as specifically or not as specifically as you would like, because
[00:17:33.674 --> 00:17:39.274]   even Mark Rondazza, who's been my lawyer off and on, you know, the student got this. He's been on
[00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:43.753]   my show and he doesn't even like to read the documents on air, even though it's from lawsuits,
[00:17:43.753 --> 00:17:45.595]  from federal documents.
[00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:49.996]  It matches up with flight manifestos and other witnesses, but it names a lot of names.
[00:17:50.016 --> 00:17:59.163]  And so I think instead of just even naming names, perhaps we should just get into what eyewitnesses said is inside the temple, and then other temples around the world, and the big picture.
[00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:00.284]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:00.304 --> 00:18:00.764]  Let's do that.
[00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:08.510]  And we released some of this info yesterday, like the flight manifest, and obviously, I mean, you're not naming names if you mention Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and people like that.
[00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:12.773]  I remember what was written, it was a Kevin Spacey and Matt Green.
[00:18:12.973 --> 00:18:14.874]  Governor Bill Richardson, but it's a lot of other people.
[00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:23.059]  That surprised me, Governor Bill Richardson, because I just thought of him as sort of an inconsequential governor who, you know, wasn't really a part of the elite because no one really liked him.
[00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:38.027]  So, before we get into the specifics, do you think there's a connection, because we do have to be honest about this, full disclosure, with President Donald Trump, do you think there's a connection with President Trump beyond what we already know, that, you know, they were friends a long time ago when he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago, I think in 2011?
[00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:39.248]  Is there anything else going on there?
[00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:42.862]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:18:43.862 --> 00:18:53.584]  I already vetted Trump early on, and if he had any connection to pedophilia or any connection to child trafficking that the Clintons just have all around them.
[00:18:53.604 --> 00:18:54.625]  I mean, it's not just Epstein.
[00:18:54.645 --> 00:19:04.547]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not run into this head of her foundation convicted of smuggling kids out of Haiti, and now she runs this major child group.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.002]  Obama opening the borders up and saying, let kids come across unattended.
[00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:15.164]  And then the Senate report admits thousands ended up in sex slavery, hundreds dead.
[00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:16.245]  Washington Post.
[00:19:16.325 --> 00:19:22.688]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating here is, Stephen, I'd love to say, this is something I broke.
[00:19:22.968 --> 00:19:24.629]  This is something that vindicates me.
[00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:25.429]  I'm so cool.
[00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:26.230]  I'm so incredible.
[00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.051]  It's like breaking that this pen in my hand is orange.
[00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:32.333]  This has been very well known for decades.
[00:19:32.653 --> 00:19:34.794]  It's been all over the British news for decades.
[00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:39.122]  About Prince Andrew and the Royals and how they compromise people using this.
[00:19:39.562 --> 00:19:44.745]  And so Epstein and the Clintons is just a tentacle and an extension of this.
[00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:46.927]  So here's what I did to research Trump.
[00:19:46.947 --> 00:19:50.989]  As soon as I saw him get big, I always thought he was annoying.
[00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.130]  I'm not into casinos.
[00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.512]  I'm not into bling, but I get that's his advertising.
[00:19:54.752 --> 00:19:59.115]  But as soon as I saw, I liked what he was saying on the stage, I went into research mode.
[00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.147]  And I read Roger Stone's War on Women.
[00:20:03.548 --> 00:20:05.209]  Roger Stone's book, Clinton's War on Women.
[00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:07.370]  And I already knew most of that about the Clintons.
[00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.451]  So I thought, OK, this is really accurate.
[00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:12.913]  So then I went and researched a lot of the Epstein stuff in there that I already knew was true.
[00:20:13.414 --> 00:20:15.475]  There was no Trump connection.
[00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:19.918]  Trump was probably with him at 10 or 15 parties while they lived in the same towns.
[00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:22.619]  He was a member of the club.
[00:20:22.739 --> 00:20:24.040]  Trump did throw him out.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.582]  And it turns out, told people, it was on record, for hitting on an 11-year-old girl.
[00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:27.702]  Yeah.
[00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:31.580]  And just being a creepy person that people were complaining about.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.621]  And Trump's heart was hardly ever even there.
[00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:37.463]  And so the media always tries to divert it off onto Trump.
[00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:41.626]  Like, oh, Donald Trump's best friend, Jeffrey Epstein, there's nothing there.
[00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:47.069]  But when you look at the Clintons, it is just incredible what's there.
[00:20:47.189 --> 00:20:54.174]  And it goes back to 27 different flights over six visits, as I remember, if memory serves me correctly.
[00:20:54.935 --> 00:21:00.178]  Yes, and they were on a lot of other jets together to well-known sultans that are pedophiles in the Middle East.
[00:21:00.358 --> 00:21:13.465]  And if you get into the spirit cooking, the real WikiLeaks stuff, not the fake Pizzagate stuff that the media created and got people diverted off onto and then blamed on me, but the real spirit cooking stuff, real Aleister Crowley stuff.
[00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:14.906]  So here's the best place to start.
[00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:21.450]  You rightfully explained that most people get recruited by evil because it's a hot secretary.
[00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:23.893]  Or a hot, you know, woman.
[00:21:23.993 --> 00:21:26.895]  And that's actually how most Satanists recruit people.
[00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:41.164]  And really, all Satanists are is 3,000-year-old private intelligence agencies going back to the Middle East, where this got written about in scrolls, who learn to recruit righteous peoples with slow corruption.
[00:21:41.604 --> 00:21:43.686]  First, have sex with somebody else's wife.
[00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:46.347]  Then be corrupt on your taxes.
[00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:47.708]  And that's how it begins.
[00:21:47.768 --> 00:21:53.486]   But the way it's been described to me, And it's in history books as well, is it circles of corruption.
[00:21:53.966 --> 00:21:56.667]  So at the center of the circle, I don't know if you can see that.
[00:21:56.687 --> 00:21:57.167]  Yeah, I can see it.
[00:21:57.387 --> 00:22:01.129]  But at the center... It looks kind of like an everlasting gobstopper when you cut it in half.
[00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:01.910]  Yes, exactly.
[00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:09.293]  At the center, you've got really evil control freaks that want to manipulate and control everybody else because they have all the information.
[00:22:09.313 --> 00:22:10.514]  They know where the bodies are buried.
[00:22:11.094 --> 00:22:17.917]  And then they have people outside of them that they have dirt on, who they control, who go out and work for them, just like a mafia.
[00:22:19.358 --> 00:22:23.921]  But then they get power and then they go out and manipulate people on the outside ring of that.
[00:22:24.682 --> 00:22:30.086]  And so it's like any cult, any cult operates, they just expand out from there.
[00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:32.688]  So you've got Jeffrey Epstein is in the second ring here.
[00:22:33.068 --> 00:22:36.831]  He's not in the ring with the royalty and the Clintons and all the rest of them.
[00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:39.853]  I'd say the Clintons got into that final little center area.
[00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:42.775]  Then you've got all the minions out here that kind of know what's going on.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:48.206]  But they just turned a blind eye to kids, they turned a blind eye to cocaine being shipped in, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:48.246 --> 00:23:08.549]  But you see, just like the Mexican Mafia will make you go kill a liquor store owner or a rival member of the gang to be in their mafia, or the Crips will make you go kill somebody in the bloods, or in La Cosa Nostra you've got to kill at least three or four people and you've got to carry out a bunch of other crimes so they have all the dirt on you so they can burn you anytime they want.
[00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:12.710]  Well, they found that people don't care if you've killed somebody or cheated on your wife the last 50 years.
[00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:16.306]  But what they'll really get you for is sex with kids.
[00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:21.430]  And so people know that you have to have sex with first underage people.
[00:23:22.596 --> 00:23:27.546]   Then you've got to have sex with people that are even younger until you finally go wear a mask at a satanic
[00:23:27.546 --> 00:23:35.596]   ritual and they will usually bring a high-end hooker there and they will poison her and they'll say, "Okay, she's dead.
[00:23:35.596 --> 00:23:37.596]  We've got to cover this up. You were all involved."
[00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:43.875]   The next level is actually usually shooting somebody. They'll bring somebody in, say, "This guy's a criminal." You go up
[00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:44.596]  and you shoot him.
[00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:50.615]   You're like, "Wait a minute. That's in the first 'Born' movie where after he's in mind control, he goes and kills
[00:23:50.615 --> 00:23:52.596]  the other soldier that failed."
[00:23:53.187 --> 00:23:56.888]  This is all CIA mind control, ancient mind control.
[00:23:57.428 --> 00:24:01.409]  Ancient secret societies are just what we call modern intelligence agencies.
[00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:05.550]  To look at the circle, another way to look at it is what they see it as.
[00:24:06.031 --> 00:24:08.811]  It's a pyramid, okay?
[00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:15.780]   And you've got the group at the top, That has the knowledge, everybody else below it has less and less knowledge.
[00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:22.404]  All I did was study history and how these groups actually operate to try to take people to the top of the pyramid.
[00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:38.514]  And so now that they're externalizing all of these methods to corrupt the general public, because they're now going from their cult level, getting control, to their final phase, where they try to take full societal cultural control.
[00:24:38.594 --> 00:24:50.662]   And that's when these cults from the Aztecs, To the ancient Babylonians, to the ancient Assyrians, to every ancient culture, the Druids, the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:25:06.746]  All went through periods where they would go into a decadent cycle where finally the priest class would emerge with the human sacrifice, emerge with the killing of the virgins, that's children, and externalize it and get the entire tribe to accept it.
[00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:12.248]  Are you saying you think that Epstein would have been involved with actual human sacrifices at satanic rituals?
[00:25:13.369 --> 00:25:15.289]  Absolutely, and that's what's now coming out.
[00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:16.430]  I've been saying this for 10 years.
[00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:19.312]  Because we knew about the islands, we knew about it all.
[00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:22.995]  They had underground dungeons, underground passages.
[00:25:23.235 --> 00:25:24.736]  All the locals that built it said this.
[00:25:25.097 --> 00:25:35.745]  They said that boats would pull up at night, not just with high-end girls, you know, that were 16 down to 12, that kind of knew what they were doing or their families had sold into this.
[00:25:35.765 --> 00:25:43.150]  Because Epstein, again, would go to Romania, Hungary and actually buy girls, that's now confirmed, who were, you know, 12 years old, train them and use them as sex ops.
[00:25:43.670 --> 00:26:15.975]   But we're talking about poor kids from the Caribbean Being brought in on boats at night and see that's the final level of the top of the pyramid is that Just like the crypts or the bloods want you to kill somebody The final level of the pyramid in this is killing children and it just came out in Italian newspapers two days ago That other rich elites are getting busted on islands off the coast of Italy where they're doing ritual murder orgies versus sex orgies first you go to the island and have sex with a bunch of hot hookers and
[00:26:16.593 --> 00:26:17.795]  Then it's a 16-year-old.
[00:26:18.195 --> 00:26:19.397]  Then it's a 14-year-old.
[00:26:19.717 --> 00:26:20.759]  Then it's a 12-year-old.
[00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:25.499]   then oh, this person's talking, we're gonna have to kill 'em, you're involved,
[00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:27.999]  you're gonna have to help us dispose of the body.
[00:26:27.999 --> 00:26:30.919]  (electronic music)
[00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:33.839]  (electronic music)
[00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:36.759]  (electronic music)
[00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:40.078]  Well, today, M4 Live Protein Bar.
[00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:42.239]  Mmm.
[00:26:42.624 --> 00:26:45.423]  I just devoured your cousin in four or five.
[00:26:45.423 --> 00:26:46.423]  Protein bar.
[00:26:46.423 --> 00:26:49.423]  They taste like candy bars.
[00:26:49.423 --> 00:26:50.923]  This is what I want.
[00:26:50.923 --> 00:26:52.423]  This is what I need.
[00:26:52.423 --> 00:26:55.423]  But my god, there's no fillers.
[00:26:55.423 --> 00:26:57.923]  But my god, it's solid.
[00:26:57.923 --> 00:27:00.923]  Protein bar, highest quality.
[00:27:00.923 --> 00:27:03.923]  12 bars, highest quality.
[00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:05.423]  And you can buy into it easily.
[00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:08.923]   But you're gonna be like, "What in the world's going on here?"
[00:27:08.923 --> 00:27:13.423]  Mmm, well today, in four or five.
[00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:14.923]  Protein bar.
[00:27:14.923 --> 00:27:18.923]  Mmm, I just devoured your cousin in four or five.
[00:27:18.923 --> 00:27:20.423]  Protein bar.
[00:27:20.423 --> 00:27:23.423]  Mmm, delicious vanilla.
[00:27:23.423 --> 00:27:26.423]  Mmm, delicious vanilla.
[00:27:26.423 --> 00:27:28.923]  Mmm, delicious vanilla.
[00:27:28.923 --> 00:27:32.423]  Mmm, meet my tummy.
[00:27:32.923 --> 00:27:34.923]  This is important.
[00:27:34.923 --> 00:27:37.923]  This is important. I'm...
[00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.033]  I'm 45 years old.
[00:27:40.156 --> 00:27:46.190]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes, and would jog, and couldn't lose weight.
[00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:49.600]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.402]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[00:27:55.063 --> 00:28:00.225]  I knew all about the Private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein and the pedophile rings.
[00:28:00.565 --> 00:28:05.488]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the tycoons in.
[00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:07.429]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:09.449]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.971]  I didn't know about all this.
[00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:14.412]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[00:28:15.518 --> 00:28:17.079]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:26.425]  I want you to get products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives that have 98% reviews and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:33.310]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.771]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:28:36.283 --> 00:28:37.144]  See DNA Force?
[00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:39.667]  I went out to top manufacturers.
[00:28:39.707 --> 00:28:41.509]  They're the most respected, most highly tested.
[00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:51.379]  And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.843]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[00:28:55.343 --> 00:28:56.645]  I said, I want to put $50 models.
[00:28:58.066 --> 00:28:59.087]  They said nobody's ever done that.
[00:28:59.748 --> 00:29:02.430]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy.
[00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:05.934]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[00:29:06.654 --> 00:29:07.655]  Nobody does that!
[00:29:08.536 --> 00:29:14.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this and you research every ingredient in this and then you experience it for yourself.
[00:29:15.683 --> 00:29:16.364]  It's incredible.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:29.257]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:32.141]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:29:36.952 --> 00:29:37.132]  Alex?
[00:29:37.392 --> 00:29:37.592]  Yes?
[00:29:37.832 --> 00:29:41.033]  I got a plug for the Patriot Points I get.
[00:29:41.053 --> 00:29:41.313]  Oh, thanks.
[00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:44.714]  I've gotten $180 so far this year in Patriot Points, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[00:29:45.354 --> 00:29:48.394]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:53.135]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather give that money to you.
[00:29:53.235 --> 00:29:54.356]  And I'm getting quality products.
[00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.816]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[00:29:56.936 --> 00:29:59.097]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[00:29:59.137 --> 00:29:59.837]  I've lost weight.
[00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:01.297]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[00:30:01.677 --> 00:30:03.357]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[00:30:03.477 --> 00:30:10.659]   My son used to get these little sore throats, and he puts Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:18.361]  I've never really done marketing, but I did bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.842]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[00:30:20.962 --> 00:30:23.422]  And I said, 150%, but we always discount 25%.
[00:30:24.382 --> 00:30:24.642]  So that's 100%.
[00:30:24.682 --> 00:30:26.063]  And they said, yeah.
[00:30:26.183 --> 00:30:27.403]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[00:30:27.543 --> 00:30:30.244]  And then we noticed you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[00:30:31.084 --> 00:30:34.003]   and then you're barely making any money, you need to stop that.
[00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:37.044]   And they looked at our data and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:39.124]  And I said, I want high quality stuff in there.
[00:30:39.124 --> 00:30:40.503]  I want a good price.
[00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:44.103]   But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this,
[00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:46.343]  to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[00:30:46.343 --> 00:30:50.203]   I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off 'cause there's no fillers, it's concentrated,
[00:30:50.203 --> 00:30:51.603]  it's got iodine, a little silver.
[00:30:51.603 --> 00:30:55.244]   And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[00:30:55.244 --> 00:30:58.962]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that.
[00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:01.962]   So I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:04.803]  It's still got 30 something dollars of product in it.
[00:31:04.803 --> 00:31:07.123]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out.
[00:31:06.407 --> 00:31:07.628]  You talk about energy stamina.
[00:31:07.648 --> 00:31:09.689]  You talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:11.190]  This is patented to do that.
[00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.573]  And nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:16.554]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:17.635]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[00:31:17.655 --> 00:31:21.718]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:30.364]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:30.964]  But that's okay.
[00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:31.625]  Thanks for the support.
