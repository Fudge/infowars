[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The globalists are desperate to derail Donald Trump's already successful foreign policy
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   of pulling our troops out of the Middle East and focusing more on China and their expansion of the South China Sea.
[00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.743]  Now, the U.S.
[00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:24.045]  Embassy got attacked by Iranian-backed militias.
[00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:30.229]  Hezbollah, in the last 24 hours, overran a lot of the Green Zone Embassy.
[00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.712]  And CNN and others are traitorously, as usual, calling them protesters.
[00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.854]  Protesters that are burning and attacking people.
[00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:45.497]   The first line of Iraqi police that guard the embassy History is repeating itself.
[00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:51.635]   It had to be Matthew Tiller, the U.S. Ambassador, or whoever is under him, his adjunct, that
[00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.775]  gave the order to stand down.
[00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.896]  And that's what we really need to focus on.
[00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:00.076]  History is repeating itself.
[00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:05.695]   The CIA, or elements of it, in 1979 actually backed the Ayatollah Khomeini coming in and
[00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:09.936]   taking over from the Shah because he wasn't taking orders from the West.
[00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:15.215]   Now, once they got in, they double-crossed the West and overthrew the U.S.
[00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:18.057]  Embassy in Tehran, taking hostages.
[00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:20.299]  Then, that embarrassed Jimmy Carter.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.005]  He had a failed Delta Force raid, and that was credited with getting Ronald Reagan in, in 1980.
[00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:32.425]  This is just like what happened in 1979 to Carter, and it's just like what happened with the Bay of Pigs.
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:37.928]  All of this is being done by internal units and groups within the State Department, still run by Soros.
[00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.469]  That's why we focus on people like Fiona Hill, McMaster, and others.
[00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.034]  Their subordinates, their adjuncts, their attachÃ©s are still in the State Department and are constantly rigging things like this.
[00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:56.198]   That's why Trump Globalism is about sabotaging Western systems and then having a corporate system outside of that that controls the planet.
[00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:01.257]   when he would normally tell the heads of those committees like intelligence and armed services
[00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:07.978]   because they leaked the information not just to the media but to America's enemies to sabotage
[00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:09.658]  foreign policy.
[00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:15.057]   Globalism is about sabotaging western systems and then having a corporate system outside
[00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:17.197]  of that that controls the planet.
[00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:19.197]  This is a big deal for Trump.
[00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:20.457]  He needs to come out.
[00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:24.818]   He needs to sack this ambassador or he needs to find out exactly what's happened and punish
[00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:26.177]  whoever stood down.
[00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:33.538]  This is a real show of weakness to let these people overrun the embassy, engage in this type of terrorist activity, and not be responded to.
[00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:34.318]  That is U.S.
[00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:43.260]  soil like your home being stormed by people with weapons, people with knives, people burning things, assaulting, reportedly killing people, and it's being called protest.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   Now finally, Iraqi military from outside the base came in and saved U.S. forces.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.840]   Now let's be clear, there's a group called SOC that has a contract, private contractor
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.878]   group to run security for the State Department, but they're the command of the State Department.
[00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.439]  So they're calling this Trump's new Benghazi.
[00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.759]  Trump hasn't stood down on this.
[00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.560]   If he stood down and withheld aid for 13, 14, 15 hours, that would be a Benghazi.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560]  He hasn't done that.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   This is Iran responding to U.S. airstrikes against their forces that are carrying out
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.639]  military operations inside Iraq yesterday.
[00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.439]  And this is a direct attack on the United States of America.
[00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.319]   And as usual, traitors and terrorists inside our government are trying to sabotage the
[00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.079]  best interests of America and the rest of the world.
[00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.998]  It is nothing short, but absolute.
[00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:27.159]  Absolute outright treason.
[00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:34.324]  In closing, we won't be on the air to counter the Globalist's talking points unless you spread the word about the broadcast and unless you buy the products.
[00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:37.986]  And right now is the end of 2019, end of 2020.
[00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:43.050]  For the next week only, it's the biggest sale to sell out of everything in the New Year's.

[00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:00.178]  (electronic beeping)

[00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:06.735]  My second cup of the day.
[00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:07.716]  It's really strong.
[00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:08.516]  I shouldn't do this.
[00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:11.719]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.060]  And the coffee adds to it, but mmm.
