[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:02.290]  Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.890]  Merry Christmas!
[00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.751]  And it's about Jesus Christ!
[00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:10.493]  It's not about the big corporations, and the Chi-Com atheists, and the globalists!
[00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:15.675]  Because in China, if you say Merry Christmas, you get shipped off to a concentration camp!
[00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.516]  Well, that's all you do, you say, MERRY CHRISTMAS!
[00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:33.634]  We're taught to believe that if we submit to the left and use the words they tell us to use and follow their nomenclature, their system, that they'll leave us alone and we'll be part of the club.
[00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:39.781]  The truth is, you're giving in to cult members that know that they're bullying and dominating and taking control of you.
[00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.263]  And that's why they've allied with Islam.
[00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:48.930]  is because they see it as an authoritarian system as well that's orthodox and will force you under their control.
[00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:52.354]  That's why giving in to the bullying will never empower you.
[00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:54.015]  It starts out with, don't use the n-word.
[00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:55.377]  Well, I don't use that, so okay.
[00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:58.420]  And then next it's, oh, don't say Merry Christmas, say Happy Holidays.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.161]  And now, here we are today.
[00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.722]  Don't say mother and father.
[00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.284]  Some people don't have mother and father.
[00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.626]  And it's all cultic programming.
[00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:14.292]  A global corporate system that wants to destroy true liberalism, that wants to destroy the renaissance that the West started.
[00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:19.156]  So the true liberal system of the West is antithetical to neo-liberalism.
[00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:20.978]  It is really neo-fascism.
[00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:22.639]  And they admit this in all their white papers.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.802]  They are scientifically destroying language.
[00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:32.361]   And now universities are command bases of anti-free speech and of orthodoxy and of cult
[00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:34.760]  programming in their own admissions.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.201]   And now like metastasizing cancers, they are bursting forth and spreading the disease throughout
[00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.921]  the general population.
[00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:46.480]   Communist Chinese Confucius centers spend hundreds of millions a year working with the
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.421]   Ford Foundation on the left, teaching the anti-free speech orthodoxy in the schools.
[00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:57.481]   And Apple and Google eagerly help communist China suppress their own people and have created
[00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:03.320]   a global social score that the UN is adopting from the Chinese communist government.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.841]   Face scanning to get on the internet, tracking and tracing, controlling your every movement.
[00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.721]  So it starts with, don't say, Merry Christmas.
[00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:24.108]  And it ends with all over Europe they take children at least three times a year to mosque and teach them to pray to Mohammed because again there's 1.8 billion Muslims about to be 3 billion by 2030 in 10 years.
[00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:41.607]   They create an orthodox centralized system as well that is going to be welded into the new fascist left-west and out of that marriage you will have the communist socialist system of Islam merge with that again in their own documents, their own admissions, their own alliance.
[00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:48.210]  Global corporations with a fake form of liberalism merge with radical Islam.
[00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:49.791]  This is the orthodoxy.
[00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:50.932]  This is the plan.
[00:02:51.132 --> 00:03:07.444]   All over Europe and now here in the United States they have to put barriers up at Christmas around Christmas trees because the truck of peace will run down hundreds of men, women and children and then The New York Times and the other high priest of knowledge tell us, oh, that's not Islam.
[00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:10.487]  Don't say that the attack at the Naval Center is Islam.
[00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.451]  Oh, don't say that the attack in New York is Islam.
[00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.773]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:19.076]  And anyone that's saying that is bad and they need to be silenced.
[00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:19.897]  That's right.
[00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:21.939]  And then if you expose Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.741]  And the child kidnapping rings that have all come out.
[00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:27.704]  Well, the ADL comes out and says you're a Nazi.
[00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:30.807]  And then they go out and attack you and get you to be platformed.
[00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:36.572]  This is a very, very sick, evil alliance of corrupt authoritarian systems all working in unison.
[00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:44.660]  And if they can get you to not use the words mother and father, they can get you to not use the word Jesus Christ, they can get you to not say Merry Christmas, well then there's nothing you won't do.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.366]  And meanwhile, the younger generation is literally being brainwashed and programmed inside the public school systems.
[00:03:52.486 --> 00:04:00.773]  And now AI is being enforced into the computers and into the text documents in live time controlling what you can and can't say.
[00:04:01.453 --> 00:04:07.078]  A technocracy beyond anything George Orwell could ever imagine is now here amongst us.
[00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:10.556]  Freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:13.399]  And now freedom is the ability to say Merry Christmas.
[00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.203]  I heard about the war on Christmas stuff 20 years ago and didn't believe it.
[00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:18.945]  I said, come on, that's not what that is.
[00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.308]  And now they admit that's what it is.
[00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.770]  All over the U.S.
[00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.732]  they tell children, don't give up Christmas cards.
[00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:39.334]  In public school, separation of church and state, knowing full well that's the First Amendment, saying Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof, that you as a citizen in a public school, in a private school, on a street corner can talk about whatever you wanted!
[00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:43.149]  You could talk about atheism, animism, Islam, Christianity.
[00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:44.530]  You could talk about Harry Potter.
[00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:48.674]  But they tell children here and in Europe, you don't hand out Christmas cards.
[00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:58.241]  This cult is bullying Christians all over the world because Christianity is antithetical to their global corporate takeover and its alliance with Islam.
[00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:02.165]  But the world is awakening to this tyranny and the people are not buying it.
[00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:07.395]  And the leftist program to dominate and bully us into submission has failed.
[00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:13.499]  That's why they're intensifying their controls and trying to drive people into submission, but it's only going to backfire.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:26.508]  So make no mistake, when you exercise your free speech, and when you use the words that these control freak cultists say you shouldn't use, you are literally destroying their attempt to bully us into the next level of total control.
[00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.210]  You guys come on through.
[00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.430]  It's the public, come on in.
[00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:31.452]  God bless you, how you guys doing?
[00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:33.069]  It's a great family.
[00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:34.369]  What's your name, sir?
[00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.150]  I'm John England.
[00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.790]  Nice to meet you, man.
[00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.950]  How you guys doing?
[00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.510]  Good, good.
[00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.731]  Can I get a picture with you?
[00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.051]  Yes, sir.
[00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.511]  Let's do it.
[00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.331]  Great looking family.
[00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:40.831]  Thank you.
[00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:43.212]  Let's get a picture of this.
[00:05:43.272 --> 00:05:45.212]  My wife, my daughters, and my son.
[00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:45.892]  Awesome.
[00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:49.953]  Get it?
[00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:50.533]  Snap it.
[00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:51.213]  Alright.
[00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:51.413]  Got it.
[00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:52.394]  Thank you, sir.
[00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:52.874]  God bless you.
[00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:56.495]  We're out here talking about the Islamic attack on Christmas and the rest of it.
[00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:57.195]  Yeah, sure.
[00:05:57.235 --> 00:05:59.035]  Can I take a picture with you?
[00:05:59.055 --> 00:05:59.475]  Let's do it.
[00:05:59.515 --> 00:05:59.956]  Absolutely.
[00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:00.696]  Thank you so much.
[00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:01.376]  God bless you guys.
[00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:01.916]  We love you.
[00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:02.982]  Love you guys.
[00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:04.623]  Great.
[00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:05.665]  Thank you.
[00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.046]  I see you guys have a great one.
[00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:08.588]  Guys be safe.
[00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.131]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.732]  Hey, hey, I just saw you.
[00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:15.055]  I didn't want to interrupt, but if you got some time.
[00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:17.558]  I was just curious if you thought there was a war on Christmas.
[00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.581]  What you're thinking about the war on the Christmas this year?
[00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:37.928]   Oh, well, there's absolutely in All the different WikiLeaks and all the different public documents and statements, a war on Christianity, a war on Western culture, a systematic demonization of it, saying it's offensive to say Merry Christmas, say Happy Holidays to people.
[00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:40.991]  I mean, that is an admitted, stated plan.
[00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:47.099]  So you really feel that people are angry at that tree when they drive by?
[00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.338]   No, when the Islamists all over Europe and other areas in New York run people over at
[00:06:52.338 --> 00:06:55.659]   the Christmas trees and they have to put barriers up all over Europe because the Muslims run
[00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:56.659]  them over.
[00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.659]  Oh, that's what you're talking about.
[00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:04.419]   Yeah, I mean there's a real, you understand that almost every Muslim country is 99% or
[00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.138]  100% Muslim.
[00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:07.220]  I mean, I don't know about that.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.182]  I was just wondering... No, but I mean, can you go to Saudi Arabia and tell them you're an atheist and walk around the street?
[00:07:12.322 --> 00:07:13.002]  I don't know, man.
[00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:17.704]  I was just asking if you were upset about the Christmas tree or you thought people were upset about the Christmas tree.
[00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:21.725]  Oh, yeah, they've had to put barriers up all over Europe around all the Christmas trees and Christmas festivals.
[00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:22.726]  Oh, I thought about this one.
[00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:27.387]  Oh, yeah, that's why it says, Happy Holidays, because people will sue or complain if it says Merry Christmas.
[00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:28.648]  Oh, I didn't even notice that.
[00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.529]  Yeah, yeah, so there's a major war.
[00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.571]  Have you heard they tell kids even in Texas don't do Christmas cards?
[00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:35.212]  Because of separation of church and state?
[00:07:35.252 --> 00:07:35.953]  I don't have any kids.
[00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:37.073]  I haven't heard about that.
[00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.796]  But you know, separation of church and state is the government can't get involved in religion and prescribe it.
[00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:43.958]  You can't prescribe what somebody talks about in public school.
[00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.860]  Nah, I don't know anything about that.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.580]  I don't have any kids.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.861]  No, no, no, but I understand.
[00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.503]  But what I'm telling you is there is a war on Christmas.
[00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.044]  There is a war on Christianity.
[00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:56.643]  Did you know that more than half of all religious persecution in the world is against Christians?
[00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:57.983]  I believe it.
[00:07:58.003 --> 00:07:59.664]  I mean, we're one of the largest groups.
[00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:05.526]  So, statistically, if there's an attack on a religion, there's going to be a lot of attack on Christians.
[00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:08.267]  Well, Islam is the biggest religion right now.
[00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:10.648]  And there's about to be 3 billion Muslims.
[00:08:11.288 --> 00:08:12.549]  There's 1.8 billion right now.
[00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.709]  I suppose.
[00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:14.949]  I mean, Pakistan's huge.
[00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.431]  Well, you know in the Koran, there's the house of Islam.
[00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:22.212]  That means in an Islamic country, there's the house of war.
[00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.311]  I haven't read the Quran.
[00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:28.294]  Because they don't recognize any, any country or religion outside.
[00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:29.936]  There's Islam, there's the house of war.
[00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:32.899]  Everything else is war outside of where they control.
[00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.399]  Oh.
[00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.784]  And that's why they're always in wars with each other, because they're always saying, oh you're not really the proper Islam.
[00:08:40.746 --> 00:08:44.829]  And then our media tells us, oh no, Islam's wonderful, it runs great societies, it invented mathematics.
[00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.190]  Islam's 1400 years old.
[00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:47.552]  Islam didn't invent anything.
[00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:51.574]  It did help teach the West about transatlantic slave trade.
[00:08:51.974 --> 00:09:03.197]  And so I just am not going to sit here when the New York Times or everybody else tells me to worship Islam and tells me that Islam never hurt a single person in history, when Mohammed was a slave trader... I don't think the New York Times says that at all.
[00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:03.597]  Oh my God.
[00:09:03.617 --> 00:09:05.718]  The New York Times doesn't tell you to worship Islam, man.
[00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:11.839]  Oh my God, I had the New York Times reporter basically say, we're coming after you if you don't stop going after Islam.
[00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.040]  They said that?
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.100]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:18.297]  And they write huge cover story after cover story, total lies.
[00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:20.618]  You're not very liked in the New York Times, no.
[00:09:20.918 --> 00:09:22.319]  Well, I don't care about the New York Times.
[00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:26.220]  They're a total fraud joke, propped up by Mexican, you know, drug lords and people.
[00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.261]  I'm not, yeah, Carlos Slim.
[00:09:28.841 --> 00:09:30.222]  I'm not, you know about him?
[00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:33.683]  No, oh, Carlos Slim, yeah, the mega-millionaire, mega-millionaire.
[00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:34.544]  Billionaire, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:34.564 --> 00:09:35.264]  Is he the richest now?
[00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:36.405]  He was for a while.
[00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:38.485]  He's heavily connected to the narcotics trade.
[00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:43.568]  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to... I mean, yeah, I mean, I love the organized crime organization, but the New York Times doesn't like me.
[00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:49.132]   I'm just saying, They come out and say that people have to make up crimes of Islam because they don't exist.
[00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:53.653]  But, I mean, there's so many crimes of Islam that I've decided it's just a full-time covering now.
[00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:57.273]  Because they just, it's the one thing they don't want you to talk about.
[00:09:58.614 --> 00:09:59.974]  So you're asking, is somebody mad at that tree?
[00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:01.094]  Uh, yeah.
[00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:05.215]  Anytime the Muslim population goes above 5%, it becomes house of war.
[00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:06.335]  They begin attacking.
[00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:08.976]  I mean, there are statues all over Europe being torn down that are Christian.
[00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:09.616]  Just the last week.
[00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:12.456]  Grabbed, cut up in pieces, smashed, destroyed.
[00:10:12.677 --> 00:10:13.737]  People being mass raped.
[00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:14.617]  Uh, everything.
[00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.662]  Sorry, I was just curious what was going on with the tree.
[00:10:19.783 --> 00:10:23.606]  Would you feel safe, yourself, going and living in Pakistan?
[00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:25.748]  Uh, yeah, probably.
[00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:29.210]  Yeah, women's journals tell women to go live there, and they get caught up and killed.
[00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.693]  Yeah, they've been having a lot of problems with women, uh, violence on women.
[00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:34.535]  But wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:36.497]  Well, that's because a lot of that's Islam.
[00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:38.338]  Islam has never hurt any women.
[00:10:39.099 --> 00:10:40.440]  Didn't have them coming to it.
[00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:42.065]  Oh, dude.
[00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:43.586]  No, no, I'm speaking for Islam.
[00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:45.286]  Oh, on the back, I know.
[00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:46.306]  I heard the woman.
[00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.967]  I'm actually Islamic, though.
[00:10:48.207 --> 00:10:49.147]  Wait, wait, I'm a Muslim now.
[00:10:49.627 --> 00:10:50.587]  So it's okay if I stone him to death?
[00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:54.869]  Now, if I'm an American and say that it's bad... You're never okay to stone a woman to death.
[00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:56.109]  No, no, no, but if I'm a Muslim, it'd be okay.
[00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.169]  No.
[00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:58.590]  No, no, no, no, I'm a Muslim.
[00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.850]  I can stone him now.
[00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.290]  I can throw gays off buildings if I was a Muslim, right?
[00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.910]  That's okay, right?
[00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:03.511]  But if I was an American, it'd be bad.
[00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:17.322]  Because I'm telling you about all this Muslim crime, and all this Muslim evil, and all this anti... And then as soon as I make a little pro-Islam statement about, you know, stoning women to death, which I don't agree with, you go, whoa, whoa, I got one of the Americans, an evil American, he's got to be kept on the reservation.
[00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:19.083]  He's got to be kept online.
[00:11:19.343 --> 00:11:21.424]  Sorry, man, I didn't mean to cause offense.
[00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:24.505]  No, no, no, no, no, it's... I'm explaining this paradigm.
[00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:26.226]  I'm explaining this paradigm.
[00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:29.927]  Where we're just totally programmed to hate ourselves, talk about how bad we are all day.
[00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:31.888]  If America's so bad, why does everybody want to come here?
[00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:33.272]  It's a great country.
[00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:35.854]  Yeah, but why are we constantly told how horrible it is to turn the news on?
[00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:38.355]  I mean, there's always room for improvement.
[00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:39.796]  I don't think it's bad to point that out.
[00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:40.977]  But yeah, America's great.
[00:11:41.037 --> 00:11:41.297]  Love it.
[00:11:41.477 --> 00:11:42.077]  Well, that's good.
[00:11:42.337 --> 00:11:43.218]  It was good talking to you, buddy.
[00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:43.838]  Merry Christmas.
[00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:44.579]  Again, sorry to interrupt.
[00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:45.019]  Merry Christmas.
[00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:45.619]  I was just curious.
[00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:46.520]  Did you say Merry Christmas?
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.240]  Merry Christmas.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.661]  Fuck, criminal right there.
[00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.142]  Have a good night, man.
[00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:51.482]  God bless.
[00:11:52.743 --> 00:11:53.403]  No, you didn't interrupt.
[00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:54.164]  We're glad to talk to you.
[00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:55.625]  See what I'm talking about here?
[00:11:57.806 --> 00:11:59.727]  I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of bad stuff to women.
[00:12:00.592 --> 00:12:02.117]  And I go, didn't have it coming to me.
[00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:06.493]  I said, oh my God, it's like, yeah, cuz we're all just proving how good we are.
[00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.291]  But you make a joke, you see.
[00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.131]  You can't do that in America.
[00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:09.932]  There's no jokes here.
[00:12:10.252 --> 00:12:11.633]  The thought police are going to get you.
[00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:13.634]  Watch what you say, you stinking Americans.
[00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:18.337]  We don't go to other people's countries and sit there and tell them not to worship animals.
[00:12:18.618 --> 00:12:20.739]  We don't sit there and tell them to stop doing what they're doing.
[00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:28.524]  No, instead, it's reverse colonization with the globalists bringing the worst ideas into the West and then telling us to sit down and shut up and give up our culture.
[00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:29.205]  Well, you know what?
[00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:30.606]  I'm going to commit a thought crime.
[00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:33.447]  Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:12:33.848 --> 00:12:35.048]  Merry Christmas!
[00:12:35.469 --> 00:12:36.910]  And it's about Jesus Christ!
[00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.653]  It's not about the big corporations, and the Qaikom atheists, and the globalists!
[00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:46.816]  Because in China, if you say Merry Christmas, you get shipped off to a concentration camp!
[00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:50.219]  Or if you're a Muslim, you get shipped off to a concentration camp.
[00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:55.964]  And our media and the left are massively allied with the Communist Chinese.
[00:12:56.544 --> 00:13:00.728]  So again, in this 1984 system, I'm gonna say it!
[00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:03.050]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:08.935]  It's so simple!
[00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:11.263]  People fought for free speech!
[00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:16.467]  Stop letting the corporations tell you how to speak and how to live!
[00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:23.932]  Exercise your free speech in the face of the leftist authoritarians or lose everything!
[00:13:24.352 --> 00:13:26.352]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:26.352 --> 00:13:28.352]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:30.352]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.352]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:33.379]  Yeah!
[00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:34.540]  Other folks are doing it!
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.802]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.133]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:42.417]  God bless you, brother!
[00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:43.659]  Merry Christmas!
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.911]  It's like a network saying, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:51.634]  Well, that's all you do.
[00:13:51.654 --> 00:14:00.202]  You say, Merry Christmas is the same thing to these devil worshippers and leftists and people attacking Christmas events in Europe.
[00:14:00.662 --> 00:14:02.344]  Merry Christmas!
[00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.486]  We're not surrendering, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:04.786 --> 00:14:06.188]  America and the world is awake.
[00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:07.649]  Freedom is rising.
[00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:14.528]  and Merry Christmas from InfoWars.com.
[00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:18.528]  There's a war on Christmas. There's a war on America.
[00:14:18.528 --> 00:14:22.528]   There's a war on our free speech. There's a war on the family's very existence.
[00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.164]  And all over the world, Christians are being persecuted.
[00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:31.970]  But Hollywood and the corporate media promote it like it doesn't happen, or that it's something cute, it's something funny.
[00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.811]  But it really is a sick.
[00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:40.718]  And those very same forces that have it out for Christianity, have it out for Infowars, and have it out for you and your family.
[00:14:41.442 --> 00:14:48.645]  But bottom line, when you spread the word about Infowars, when you spread the word about the videos and the articles, you make these scumbags so damn angry.
[00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:51.186]  Just like when you use the term Merry Christmas.
[00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:54.687]  They absolutely hate that because they want to make you say Happy Holidays.
[00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.668]  They want to make you talk like they want you to talk.
[00:14:57.708 --> 00:14:59.489]  They want to make you their puppets.
[00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:01.949]  Well, I'm not their puppet, and I know you're not their puppet.
[00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:09.866]   And once we're awake, and once we're pissed off, and once we're not submitting to them, Once we start exercising our speech, we start winning.
[00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:12.051]  And that's what's been happening, and that's why they've been censoring us.
[00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:14.176]  But they can't stop you from getting the word out.
[00:15:15.384 --> 00:15:17.885]  And if you fund InfoWars, there's really nothing they can do.
[00:15:17.905 --> 00:15:18.945]  We're going to stay on the air.
[00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.026]  We're going to expand in 2020.
[00:15:20.826 --> 00:15:23.607]  But we need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com this Christmas.
[00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:26.308]  We need you to fund InfoWars by getting great products you need.
[00:15:26.328 --> 00:15:27.929]  We've got huge sales going right now.
[00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:30.069]  Double Patriot points, the 12 days of Christmas.
[00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:34.291]  Some of these are the biggest sales we've ever offered, and you're truly investing in your future when you do it.
[00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:35.811]  So go check out the Patriot apparel.
[00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:37.952]  Go check out the Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:40.193]  He's like Christmas lights, they don't hang themselves shirt.
[00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:41.333]  Check out the ball caps.
[00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:43.094]  Check out the air filtration, the water filtration.
[00:15:43.194 --> 00:15:44.835]  And give yourself the gift of great products.
[00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:50.200]  Give your family and friends and neighbors and co-workers the gift of great products, books, films, you name it, thousands of items.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:56.545]  And then also give yourself the gift of information warfare and putting your money on an organization that will not back down, that will not give in.
[00:15:56.585 --> 00:15:57.186]  You're amazing.
[00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.627]  I want to thank you all for putting up with me.
[00:15:58.647 --> 00:16:04.151]  And I want to just encourage you with this Christmas and the New Year coming up to redouble your efforts, to exercise your free speech or lose it.
[00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:06.533]  And don't let the authoritarians bully you into submission.
[00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:11.777]   Whatever your speech is, whatever your ideas are, Whatever your religion is or lack of, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:11.857 --> 00:16:22.105]  You should exercise what you believe and what you stand for and not go with the corporate media or the universities or any of these institutions that are attacking your right to say what you want.
[00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:26.728]  There are a lot of countries where you don't have free speech and people can move to those, but they don't want to.
[00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:33.112]  They want to come here because America was known for freedom, but we're losing that freedom and we need to stand up for it now.
[00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:36.188]   So again, We need funds to keep our organization on air.
[00:16:36.208 --> 00:16:38.209]  We're not funded by Soros and billionaires and locals.
[00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:40.730]  We're funded by viewers and listeners just like you.
[00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.450]  They're just like us.
[00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.511]  So thank you for your support in the last few years.
[00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:46.531]  And for some of you going back 25 years, we've come so far together.
[00:16:46.952 --> 00:16:49.352]  Let's see how far we come together in the future.
[00:16:49.372 --> 00:16:50.553]  Let's see how far we go.
[00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:57.495]  Because we've already done some incredible things, but we're going to do even more amazing things with your support, because you literally are the MFulwar.
[00:16:57.515 --> 00:17:01.996]  So take action at MFulwarStore.com, but whatever you do, keep praying for freedom and peace.
[00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:05.645]  Keep praying for a mass global awakening and President Trump as well.
[00:17:06.186 --> 00:17:09.491]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:10.913]  Please do your Christmas shopping there.
[00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:11.814]  It'll change the world.
