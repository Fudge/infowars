[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:05.292]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:09.054]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:12.096]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:19.580]  Yesterday Apple, iTunes, Vimeo and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.922]   Who is the most The most banned news network in the world.
[00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:24.022]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:26.763]  Alex Jones, which has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:29.444]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:30.085]  It worked.
[00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:33.406]  Jeff Zucker silenced and de-platformed his show.
[00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:35.967]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:41.069]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the wrong system.
[00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:58.116]  ABC's hit show, The Good Doctor, that routinely has 18 million viewers, that's more than a Monday night football game, dedicated an entire episode a few nights ago to demonizing yours truly.
[00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:08.605]  The producers and writers and directors of the show admitted that the character they were demonizing, that the show was built around, was an Alex Jones archetype.
[00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.803]  Mitchell Stewart, the conspiracy theorist?
[00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:13.284]  That's the celebrity now?
[00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:29.077]  Before we even meet Mitchell Stewart, the thought criminal, the doctors are walking down the hall discussing how he thinks 9-11 was an inside job, and he thinks sometimes massacres and crises are staged, and they're just shaking their head.
[00:01:29.117 --> 00:01:36.763]  They're just good medical professionals that are going in there to, you know, confront this guy about the truth, and they're only trying to help him.
[00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.970]  Guy thinks 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.251]  He's an ass.
[00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:42.731]  He's an ass who needs liver surgery.
[00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:49.872]  Mitchell Stewart, I don't blindly turn over my well-being or anything else to those in authority, so I ran background checks on all of you.
[00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:56.334]  I'm sure you consider whatever you give me to be normal medical treatment, but we all know that doctors are pushers in the pay of the drug companies.
[00:01:56.474 --> 00:02:03.135]  The vat contains an isotonic crystalloid composed of 0.9% sodium chloride dissolved in sterile water.
[00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:05.017]  You must be the autistic guy.
[00:02:05.478 --> 00:02:05.718]  Good.
[00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.580]  No bull.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.142]  Probably doesn't know what bull is.
[00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:11.347]  Bet your parents got one of those combination vaccinations.
[00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:15.853]  Not connected because science does not support an autism link.
[00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:17.883]  Yeah, that's what they told you.
[00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.644]  Our Alex Jones bad guy, Mitchell Stewart, did you just see what he did?
[00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:28.686]  He said to the autistic doctor that's only trying to save him that there's been links from vaccines to autism.
[00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.306]  That's in hundreds and hundreds of studies.
[00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:35.427]  But he just blurts out the mainstream media statement that there are WNDs in Iraq.
[00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:36.248]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:40.229]  He blurts out the mainstream media statement that Kavanaugh raped all these women.
[00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:41.189]  Oh, that's been retracted.
[00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.589]  Sorry, sorry.
[00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.250]  He just blurts out the mainstream media statement that there is no link and there is no problem.
[00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.513]  Even though autism is exploding off the charts.
[00:02:48.954 --> 00:02:52.659]  Idiopathic portal hypertension can cause- My liver is damaged, but that's not the cause.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.161]  I've been poisoned.
[00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:55.684]  Worth running that tox screen again?
[00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:01.500]  The guy has a web show where he claims that parents of children who died in school shootings are crisis actors.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.840]  These aren't some enemies.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.182]  Once we start doubting the tests, then you can't trust anything, and there's no point in anything.
[00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:26.490]  Of course, these fictitious doctors don't talk about how ABC that produced this show just got caught showing fake video from a popular machine gun shootout at Knob Creek, blowing it up and claiming that it was a war of the worlds attack on the Kurds that Trump allowed with 5,000 foot tall giant mushroom clouds.
[00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.953]  They were actually 10 foot tall mushroom clouds in Kentucky.
[00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:33.316]  Oh, but again, nobody ever stages anything.
[00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:39.641]  This video right here appearing to show Turkey's military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town.
[00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:42.264]  The Kurds who fought alongside the U.S.
[00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:43.224]  against ISIS.
[00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:50.651]  Our government claimed that Saddam beat babies brains out in incubators in Kuwait and used a young actress to go tell Congress she witnessed it.
[00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.334]  She'd never been to Kuwait and it didn't happen.
[00:03:54.234 --> 00:04:00.554]   So it's reasonable to ask questions about big events, but they don't want you doing that.
[00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:02.634]  How dangerous and un-American is that?
[00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:05.194]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:11.753]   Took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:22.767]  Now is the time to check the aggression of this ruthless dictator whose troops have bayoneted pregnant women and have ripped babies from their incubators in Kuwait.
[00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:24.609]  I cannot help but think of my nephew.
[00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:28.286]  Who if born premature might have died that day as well.
[00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:36.071]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.253]  Now, we're going to get into this episode and dissect it in just a moment.
[00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:49.738]  But first, it's important to understand that I have been chosen as the archetype by the establishment, by Hollywood, in their own words, to be the go-to villain.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:33.870]   So they are basically kidnapping my persona and then misrepresenting it, not just in shows on ABC like The Good Doctor, but in the Homeland series and in the There you have it folks, conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio, an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time!
[00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:35.847]  But that's not all, folks.
[00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:37.788]  Here's the real blockbuster.
[00:05:37.808 --> 00:05:39.629]  Brace yourselves, you might want to sit down.
[00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:42.351]  That's why we're throwing up these links, these videos.
[00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:45.752]  Streaming worldwide 24/7.
[00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:54.752]  My vacation's over!
[00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:57.408]  You'll find a new set of talking points in your folders.
[00:05:57.628 --> 00:05:58.888]  Get outraged!
[00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.909]  Go!
[00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:11.635]  Now, I want to get into the meat of this last episode, because if you look at the attack and the points they bring up, you learn what the establishment is scared of.
[00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:25.783]   And the same talking points that they raise in this fiction piece are the same talking points they raise in so-called mainstream news and in other You make many statements that have been proven wrong.
[00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:31.163]   what the establishment wants you to be psychologically inoculated to, so that if someone brings up
[00:06:31.163 --> 00:06:35.562]   these issues, you go, "Oh, that's a bunch of kooks, conspiracy theorists.
[00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.882]  I'm not allowed to look at that."
[00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:43.281]   They want you to out of hand ridicule the information instead of being open to it, because
[00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.763]  they fear you investigating.
[00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:49.603]  You make many statements that have been proven wrong.
[00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:53.723]  Do you really believe them?
[00:06:53.723 --> 00:06:56.723]  You wanna untangle what's real and what's for show?
[00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:57.973]  Now you're talking.
[00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:01.073]  Okay.
[00:07:01.073 --> 00:07:10.973]  Do you think vaccination damage is being covered up?
[00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:11.475]  Yes.
[00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:19.497]  Do you think the parents of children killed in school shootings are crisis actors?
[00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:27.650]  I can't answer for individuals, but I do believe there's a force in this country that wants to scam our people into laying down their arms.
[00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:30.632]  All of this, again, follows the script.
[00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:41.080]  Demonize people that are exposing the dangers of vaccines that are on record, or how they've been given liability protection, or the fact that Gardasil's been shown to sterilize women and actually give them cancer.
[00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:41.921]  It's incredible.
[00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:42.902]  This is all admitted.
[00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:47.345]  But they know that when we warn people, they're going to say, oh, I saw that on The Good Doctor.
[00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:48.266]  That's crazy.
[00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:53.605]   It's on record that the United States has the worst infant mortality of any industrialized nation.
[00:07:53.605 --> 00:07:55.105]  We used to be one of the best nations.
[00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:59.605]   It's on record that our life expectancy is going straight down, decade after decade.
[00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:04.105]   But they have us to believe that mainline medical science never does anything wrong,
[00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:06.605]  that drug companies never do anything wrong.
[00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:12.605]   Did you know that roughly 90% of prescription drugs that we use in this country are made in communist China?
[00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:14.605]  Hey!
[00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:17.605]  That's great, but what about the big picture?
[00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:19.990]  Once I'm out of here, I'll go back to being poisoned.
[00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:25.994]  They stage the facts to always show the person questioning the system as a crazy person.
[00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:28.295]  He believes he's being poisoned.
[00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:30.957]  His liver isn't failing because of his genetics.
[00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:34.959]  What are you eating if you're refusing hospital food?
[00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:40.042]  80 grams of protein a day, kale, baby greens.
[00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:45.816]  Leopard Spring.
[00:08:46.837 --> 00:08:52.260]  It's Chinese herbs to make you feel younger, more energetic, more... virile.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.121]  You don't feel virile?
[00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:56.822]  Of course I do, but there's nothing wrong with feeling more virile.
[00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.403]  I need strength for the fight.
[00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:03.526]  You're not talking.
[00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:07.209]  Is there a problem?
[00:09:07.369 --> 00:09:09.590]  No, these herbs are harmless.
[00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.251]  You asked about my virility.
[00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:12.612]  And there's a twist at the end!
[00:09:13.424 --> 00:09:23.510]  You find out that indeed his liver is failing, but it's because he's taking an evil over-the-counter supplement that is hurting his liver.
[00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.632]  It's not really a Chinese herb, it's Viagra.
[00:09:28.173 --> 00:09:30.354]  I've discovered the cause of your liver problem.
[00:09:30.474 --> 00:09:30.814]  Really?
[00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:31.955]  Fatty liver?
[00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:32.656]  Autoimmune?
[00:09:32.696 --> 00:09:33.736]  I've never had any symptoms?
[00:09:33.796 --> 00:09:36.098]  No, you were being poisoned.
[00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:37.218]  What?
[00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:38.559]  Who?
[00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:39.380]  Do you know who?
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:39.780]  How?
[00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:45.121]  I thought maybe the dose of herbs listed on the bottle was wrong.
[00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:46.482]  There's a toxic dose in there?
[00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.784]  No, there are no herbs at all in here.
[00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:50.426]  It contains sildenafil.
[00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:54.650]  It's the active element in Viagra.
[00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.352]  It promotes blood flow in your penis.
[00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:02.477]  I know what it does.
[00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:05.240]  They say it's natural herbs.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.181]  They lied.
[00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:13.101]  Your idiopathic portal hypertension means your liver is vulnerable to abuse.
[00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:21.667]  The amount of sildenafil in here wouldn't kill most people, but if someone with pre-existing liver issues took it every day, you were right.
[00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:23.969]  You've been poisoning yourself.
[00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.173]  Well, then he blames the Chinese, and they go, no, no, no, they're wonderful.
[00:10:29.453 --> 00:10:31.575]  Like LeBron James said, they've never done anything wrong.
[00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:32.295]  They're good.
[00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:38.356]   It was actually a company in California Those communist bastards.
[00:10:39.937 --> 00:10:42.519]  I think they're based in San Pedro.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:50.705]  Big Pharma, ladies and gentlemen, does not want you questioning their drugs, their vaccines that are made predominantly in China.
[00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:56.929]  So they set up this scenario where he's proven wrong and the good medical doctors are right.
[00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.592]  It's good news.
[00:11:02.247 --> 00:11:11.951]  Hollywood, the Democratic Party, the megacorporations, I love the communist China, admit in their own white papers that are public that they hate info wars because I am legitimate.
[00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:13.572]  I am authentic.
[00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:14.452]  I am real.
[00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:18.334]  And we have helped launch a populist movement, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:11:18.514 --> 00:11:21.095]  And they're threatened by real power of the people.
[00:11:21.475 --> 00:11:24.957]  They're threatened by real grassroots capitalism and free market.
[00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:35.024]  And so they have the fictitious Alex Jones admit that he's wrong and basically say that he's a liar so that he can be further discredited.
[00:11:36.005 --> 00:11:41.211]  I no longer think there's a pedo slave ring in a basement under that pizza joint.
[00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:43.093]  That was a wrong call.
[00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:46.672]  What did you do when you realized you'd made an error?
[00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:47.993]  Nothing.
[00:11:48.593 --> 00:11:50.253]  No apologies, no admissions.
[00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:54.735]  The second you say you were wrong, don't make it seem like everything you know is wrong.
[00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:56.736]  You can't give them that ammunition.
[00:11:57.748 --> 00:12:01.490]  Then you're not really offering the truth.
[00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.492]  On Pizzagate, it was in the WikiLeaks that they were doing this in New York.
[00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:07.072]  It's on record.
[00:12:07.332 --> 00:12:15.956]  The Spirit Cooking, Aleister Crowley, all of it, John Podesta, his brother is in the Washington Post talking about how he likes deviant art of naked little children.
[00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:24.480]  And then the media focused on the pizza place to get everybody to cover it because that wasn't going on there and then thus discrediting the whole story.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.161]  That's what I really said.
[00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:32.722]  But instead they turn around and say, there's no pedophiles, there's no targeting of children, there's no sexualization anywhere.
[00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:44.607]  And that's what's really sick about this, is the whole things about targeting children with the vaccines, with the fluoride in the water, with the GMOs, with the cultural attacks, with all of it.
[00:12:44.707 --> 00:12:51.270]  And then pointing at those of us that are saying our children are under attack and saying that we are disingenuous and we're the bad guys.
[00:12:52.090 --> 00:13:08.921]   The truth is, People know what's going on and more and more people are waking up and taking action and that's why they've chosen yours truly to be the go-to villain to try to demonize me because they fear the fact that we're telling the truth and we believe in a pro-human future.
[00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:13.544]  Maybe if people saw you admit you were wrong, maybe they'd believe you more.
[00:13:14.804 --> 00:13:15.025]  No.
[00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:17.126]  There is no middle ground.
[00:13:17.726 --> 00:13:19.347]  Compromise is a scam.
[00:13:20.628 --> 00:13:25.615]   When only one side can get what it wants, Make sure it's yours.
[00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:41.649]  As Tucker Carlson has pointed out many times, they banned myself and others off the greater internet, not because we were lying, but because what we were saying was true, and it was popular, and the people were listening and supporting it.
[00:13:42.249 --> 00:13:43.850]  That's why they took us off the air.
[00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:46.633]  Because they feared the truth.
[00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:49.095]  They know the public can smell it.
[00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:51.859]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.542]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be hurt.
[00:13:56.222 --> 00:13:57.943]  The left used to understand that.
[00:13:58.664 --> 00:13:59.484]  But they don't anymore.
[00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:00.645]  What changed?
[00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:11.312]   Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business In order to make him shut up.
[00:14:11.692 --> 00:14:12.913]  Trump didn't divide American society.
[00:14:13.013 --> 00:14:16.715]  Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and by the way justified distrust in institutions.
[00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:20.594]   They're in denial about the consequences of the world they created.
[00:14:20.594 --> 00:14:22.594]  Trump didn't divide American society.
[00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:28.594]   Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and, by the way, justified distrust in institutions.
[00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:31.594]  Elites did that with their spectacular failures.
[00:14:31.594 --> 00:14:37.594]   Trump's selection and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo,
[00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:42.594]   the stewards of which refuse to take a look in the mirror, accept blame, and reform.
[00:14:42.594 --> 00:14:43.594]  form.
[00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.699]  Censorship does not work.
[00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:47.421]  Ideas spread.
[00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:52.306]  The good ones, which are rooted in nature and observable reality, take root and they endure.
[00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:54.227]  People know what's true.
[00:14:54.467 --> 00:14:55.268]  They can smell it.
[00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.248]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:58.908]  You can't control their minds.
[00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:03.029]  You can only humiliate yourself and undermine your own authority by trying.
[00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:13.092]  Once you've been deplatformed, you can't respond to the lies in those forums, they up the ante and start openly saying that you're a racist.
[00:15:13.752 --> 00:15:17.973]  And they recruit Alec Baldwin and SNL to run the attack.
[00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:19.353]  They're shapeshifters.
[00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.534]  They look like regular people, but they're aliens.
[00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:22.974]  Look, there's one right there.
[00:15:22.994 --> 00:15:26.175]  What?
[00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:27.936]  I am not an alien!
[00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:31.897]  Here she is, and so is the woman next to her, right there.
[00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.437]  Oh, okay, no.
[00:15:37.518 --> 00:15:39.819]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.059]  From a very reputable source.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.480]  What, the FBI?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.200]  The CIA?
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.300]  Info Wars.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.381]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:15:48.234 --> 00:15:51.797]  You know he's legit because he's always taking off his shirt, okay?
[00:15:52.637 --> 00:15:54.599]  Remember when liberals supported free speech?
[00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:58.101]  Remember when universities weren't places that banned speech but encouraged it?
[00:15:58.982 --> 00:16:05.907]  Out of all the thousands of leftists that have called for me to be taken off the air, even arrested, only Bill Maher came to my aid.
[00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:10.991]  But he was really only coming to the aid of the First Amendment that he himself enjoys.
[00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:23.246]  So I want to do my free speech for a minute because Alex Jones, who is not my friend and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off Twitter, I think, and Facebook and a few other platforms.
[00:16:23.446 --> 00:16:24.327]  I think he's gonna... Thank God!
[00:16:28.223 --> 00:16:31.206]  Well, if you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech.
[00:16:31.246 --> 00:16:33.248]  That's free speech for the speech you hate.
[00:16:33.588 --> 00:16:35.009]  That's what free speech means.
[00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.253]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.936]  If you care about the real American shit, or you don't.
[00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.158]  And if you do, it goes for every side.
[00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:48.061]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:49.382]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:16:50.183 --> 00:16:59.570]  In closing, you've got to ask yourself why there are so many TV shows, movies, books, films, you name it, demonizing those of us that question 9-11.
[00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.312]  Those of us that question mass shootings.
[00:17:03.953 --> 00:17:05.974]  Those of us that question big events.
[00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:07.736]  We've been lied to so much.
[00:17:07.856 --> 00:17:09.617]  It's our right to do that.
[00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:15.021]  We see in the news every day where things have been staged, where they get caught.
[00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:25.005]  Whether it's Jesse Smollett or the Covington kids getting set up for something they didn't do, the system is more out of control and lying worse than it ever has.
[00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:32.247]  So don't let ABC or anybody else intimidate you and continue to question everything you see, because it's your right to do it.
[00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:38.129]  And history has shown that when we don't question authority, we end up with things like Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.951]  I'm Alex Jones, still fighting on at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:47.789]   If you believe in free speech, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in standing up to these bullies and not
[00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:55.151]   letting them silence you or myself or anybody else, please visit Band.Video today and see where real Americans
[00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:58.691]  and real humans are fighting for a pro-human future.
[00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:13.931]   Why would the system be so scared of American supplement companies?
[00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:25.441]  Because the power of Mother Nature, the power of Pharmakea has been known by all cultures throughout time to hold incredible secrets to health and longevity and so much more.
[00:18:25.742 --> 00:18:29.245]  And so that's why they demonize me all over for the products we sell.
[00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:38.513]   Ladies and gentlemen, one of the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com is X2 Pure Deep Earth Iodine and X3 Tri-Iodine.
[00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:42.477]  And I'm just going to tell you this if you're watching and you're a fan of this ABC propaganda.
[00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:43.337]  Don't believe me.
[00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:44.458]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.539]  Here's Business Insider.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:57.170]  Business Insider a few years ago, New York Times, 1996, about how millions and millions of people that are basically autistic and that are brain damaged and have low IQs in China because of lack of iodine in their food.
[00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.931]  Same thing happened in the Midwest in the 20s.
[00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:00.992]  They put iodine in the salt.
[00:19:01.372 --> 00:19:03.293]  IQs exploded by 15 points or more.
[00:19:03.793 --> 00:19:09.396]  And what they described back in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, what China described up until 2000, is autistic-like.
[00:19:09.897 --> 00:19:14.079]  Not talking, inside, unable to really communicate.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.083]  That's what we're promoting is clean, good iodine that no one else is selling or promoting.
[00:19:21.123 --> 00:19:21.563]  It's crazy.
[00:19:22.483 --> 00:19:25.325]  And they're scared of it because they want low IQs.
[00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:27.146]  They want dumb, manageable populations.
[00:19:27.665 --> 00:19:29.066]  It's in the WikiLeaks, they admit it all.
[00:19:29.687 --> 00:19:42.036]  And so, if you do anything, please just search and look into iodine and IQ and iodine and autism-like spectrums because they don't just take the iodine out and the soils aren't just depleted.
[00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:49.962]  They then promote the bad halogen fluoride in the water supply so it does double damage.
[00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:56.067]  Please, I'm begging you, look into this for yourself, for your children, for your own health, for your own future, for God's sakes.
[00:19:57.102 --> 00:20:00.244]  Yes, we promote something we know is really good that helps you, and that's how we fund ourselves.
[00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:06.808]  It's okay when ABC News gets all their funding from the war companies and the oil companies, but when we sell something, we're bad.
[00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:11.311]  Just, whatever you do, look in the eye of yourself and find out the truth.
[00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:13.632]  And find out why they're keeping it from you.
[00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:14.713]  These people are bad.
[00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:18.135]  And the average doctor is just a cult member following along with the system.
[00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:19.656]  Please, check it out for yourself.
[00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:22.858]  There's a reason we were deplatformed 14 months ago.
[00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:29.748]   And it's because InfoWars has been over the target with something like a 98% accuracy rate.
[00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:35.268]   We have laid out everything that's going on and folks are really paying attention now.
[00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:39.109]   That means now is the time to support the InfoWar more than ever
[00:20:39.109 --> 00:20:42.069]  and we're going to take this thing over the top together.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.822]  Everything must go super sale, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:50.905]  This sale on some items on the site is the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:55.107]  40 to 70% off storewide.
[00:20:55.948 --> 00:21:03.012]  Many of these are at cost or below because we're offering free shipping on every order and double Patriot points.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:15.298]  Take advantage of the Everything Must Go Sale and the funds that come in allow us to fund ourselves into next year and order new product for next year at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:18.824]  That's InfoWareStore.com and thank you for your support.
