[00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.404]  We're here in San Antonio, Texas about to cover a student RFID protest in just mere moments.
[00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:26.899]  We stopped here at this neighborhood Walmart to check for directions and as you can see we're surrounded by not only a Walmart, a GameStop, a Staples office supply store, but also a NSA data mining center.
[00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:10.740]  Now in 2008, and I wouldn't be surprised if it has happened again since then, a journalist was detained for 45 minutes for filming the then under construction NSA Data Mining Center.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.144]  We have been able to avoid detention here and we are not going to press our luck.
[00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.868]  This is Ja'Kari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.930]  Hey, NSA, if you decide to confiscate this tape, we are truly looking for the visitor center and we would like to take a tour.
[00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:41.172]  Yeah, we're trying to find the visitor center.
[00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:42.733]  Do you guys do guided tours here?
[00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:43.573]  No, we don't.
[00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:46.313]  Do you guys have any, like, information we can take home or anything like that?
[00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:48.014]  Information as far as what?
[00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.854]  I mean, just, like, what do you guys do here?
[00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:51.354]  Because, like, you guys do have a visitor center.
[00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:52.075]  Is that correct, sir?
[00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:52.295]  We don't.
[00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:53.215]  We can't get that information out.
[00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.090]  Okay.
[00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:57.812]  Are we being detained officer?
[00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:58.472]  Absolutely not.
[00:01:58.592 --> 00:01:59.213]  Okay, just asking.
[00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.073]  Just getting some information.
[00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:02.375]  You're asking me for info, I'm asking info for you, right?
[00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.316]  Hey, can you answer my questions if I ask you some questions?
[00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:04.736]  Okay.
[00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:05.877]  Can I get your ID, too?
[00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.298]  Well, sir, she's not driving.
[00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:08.559]  Why do I need to give you my ID?
[00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.100]  I'm trying to verify who you guys are.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.061]  You're asking me questions and you don't know who you are.
[00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:12.762]  Who am I talking to?
[00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:14.062]  Okay, what is it that you want to know?
[00:02:14.082 --> 00:02:16.544]  Because you understand this is restricted government property, this area?
[00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:22.548]  Well, sir, like I said- There's a sign right here that states, no electrical equipment, no video camera, no filming.
[00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:24.648]  Okay sir, we'll be happy to leave.
[00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.691]  I'm just asking, can you confirm for me that there is a visitor's center over there though?
[00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:32.133]  How did you know there was a visitor's center?
[00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:34.034]  Sir, there's a sign over there.
[00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:37.116]  I'm just asking, can you confirm that it's over there?
[00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:37.956]  I'm not being a smart aleck.
[00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:41.078]  I know, I'm asking you, if you saw a sign, why are you asking me if there's a visitor's center?
[00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.699]  And what is your name officer?
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.180]  My name is Sergeant Rivera.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.241]  There is in fact a visitor's sign.
[00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:51.825]  When we got over there, we didn't see any clear marketing that said visitor's center.
[00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:53.804]  Yes.
[00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:57.587]  Can you at least confirm from my camera that you do have a visitor center here?
[00:02:57.607 --> 00:02:59.148]  I cannot confirm anything, sir.
[00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:04.892]  I think I'm going to see someone in front of that car.
[00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:04.992]  Rob.
[00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:06.052]  Hey, they still got us out here.
[00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:07.633]  They got three cop cars on us.
[00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.914]  Oh yeah?
[00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:10.615]  What'd they say?
[00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:11.336]  They're not letting us leave.
[00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:12.437]  Yeah, I asked if we were detained.
[00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:15.018]  They said no, but they're checking both our driver's licenses.
[00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:16.139]  It's been like 10 minutes now.
[00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.180]  We're sandwiched in.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.960]  We can't leave.
[00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:18.241]  Yeah.
[00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.682]  Are you taping all this?
[00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:21.563]  Yeah, we haven't turned the camera off.
[00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:28.778]  No, they said we're not detained, but they won't let us leave.
[00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.122]  No, he won't confirm what this building is.
[00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:39.847]  He just said it's a government institution and I asked him where the visitor center is and he's like, why do you want to go to the visitor center?
[00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.170]  Yeah, we got whoever the guy was.
[00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.032]  I couldn't, his shirt said something.
[00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:46.672]  I couldn't make it out.
[00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.614]  I think it said like national security or something like that.
[00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:59.990]  One of them is San Antonio Police, the other have unmarked vehicles, so I'm not sure who they are.
[00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.711]  It's completely unmarked.
[00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:02.252]  Okay, hold on.
[00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:03.192]  I'll try to get him over here.
[00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:04.053]  I'll try to get him over here.
[00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:05.514]  Excuse me, sir?
[00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:06.995]  Officer?
[00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:08.276]  My boss is on the phone.
[00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.637]  He'd like to talk to you if you have the time.
[00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:14.060]  Actually, I'm conducting my business right now, so if you could, go ahead and hang up while I'm talking to you.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.301]  Okay, he's requesting that we hang up the phone.
[00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:19.243]  Why is that?
[00:04:19.263 --> 00:04:20.284]  My boss is asking why is that.
[00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:20.884]  Why?
[00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.906]  Because it's common courtesy to a police officer that I'm talking to you, the driver.
[00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:24.427]  Okay.
[00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.621]  Okay, alright, alright.
[00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:28.201]  I'll put it right there.
[00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.502]  They're coming up on the other side of the car too.
[00:04:30.822 --> 00:04:30.982]  Yeah.
[00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:31.062]  So.
[00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:34.002]  What's happening?
[00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:36.083]  They said they're still conducting their business.
[00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:38.503]  Like I said, it's been at least 20 minutes now.
[00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:41.004]  He said it's common courtesy not to talk on the phone.
[00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:41.104]  Yeah.
[00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:43.504]  Oh, now you're telling me you don't have common courtesy.
[00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:45.164]  Here they come, here they come, here they come.
[00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:45.945]  Alright, hold on, hold on Alex.
[00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:47.905]  Put the phone down by the side.
[00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:49.325]  Alright guys, you guys got a business card?
[00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:50.705]  Yes, yes I do.
[00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:53.406]  Matter of fact, officer, this is my boss's business card.
[00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:58.093]  He's actually, he'd like to talk to you guys if you have the time.
[00:04:58.113 --> 00:04:59.554]  Okay.
[00:04:59.574 --> 00:04:59.814]  Sure.
[00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:00.575]  All right, man.
[00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:02.416]  You guys are free to go, man.
[00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:02.916]  Thanks a lot.
[00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:03.657]  Thank you, sir.
[00:05:04.177 --> 00:05:05.178]  And what's your name, officer?
[00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:06.719]  Please don't come back here.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.400]  Okay.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.681]  We won't block this entrance again.
[00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.121]  Thank you, sir.
[00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:11.763]  Okay.
[00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:12.984]  All right, Alex.
[00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:13.765]  They said we can go.
[00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:24.473]  And, uh, yeah, we just had a encounter with, uh, at least one police officer, two unmarked vehicles, one marked vehicle.
[00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.868]  I'm here filming Melissa Melton.
[00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.336]  We came out here to the NSA Data Mining Center in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:37.361]  They got out, they left us out here for at least 20 minutes as they ran their checks.
[00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.086]  I'm sure we are now on a database somewhere like we weren't before, but you know.
