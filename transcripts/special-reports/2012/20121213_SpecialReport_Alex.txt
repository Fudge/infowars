[00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:01.591]  So,
[00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:40.239]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.320]  I'm Melissa Melton.
[00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.024]  Here's what we have in store for you on this December 13, 2012 edition.
[00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:53.286]  Tonight, Harry Belafonte wants Obama's critics in gulags.
[00:00:53.926 --> 00:01:01.032]  The only thing left for Barack Obama to do is to work like a third world dictator and put all these guys in jail.
[00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:05.815]  Then, a student documents every known U.S.
[00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:08.638]  drone strike within the last 10 years.
[00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:13.081]  Plus, breaking news from a JFK insider.
[00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.765]  All that and more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:33.098]  Tonight I want to start with a special report that should scare any free-thinking Americans that are still left.
[00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:46.585]  Today, Harry Belafonte, a social activist who's gone on record to say that he sympathizes with communist leader Fidel Castro, came out to say that anyone who opposes the agenda of Barack Obama should be rounded up and imprisoned.
[00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:48.266]  Let's take a look at this clip.
[00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:50.781]  And I don't know what more they want.
[00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:58.449]  The only thing left for Barack Obama to do is to work like a third world dictator and just put all these guys in jail.
[00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:07.179]  So there you have it, Belafonte going on record to say that anybody who disagrees with Barack Obama should be quote, put in jail.
[00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.820]  They should
[00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:11.314]  Work like a third world dictator and put all these guys in jail.
[00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:13.995]  Now where did Belafonte get that idea from?
[00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:16.236]  It's not new, we've actually heard that before.
[00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:23.318]  If you recall, Bill Ayers, former Obama mentor and Weather Underground terrorist, actually went on record saying the same thing.
[00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:24.578]  Let's take a look at that clip.
[00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.559]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.202]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:47.935]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:54.660]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the Counter-Revolution.
[00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:06.170]  And they felt that this Counter-Revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:17.862]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.384]  I asked, well what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:25.125]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:28.906]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:35.349]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.061]  In these re-education centers.
[00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:41.803]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:42.683]  25 million people.
[00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:58.952]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them
[00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:04.870]  Figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.992]  And they were dead serious.
[00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:23.530]  So there you have former FBI agent Larry Grathwald talking about how he infiltrated the weather underground, and that Bill Ayers and his associates were talking about how they would have to eliminate 25 million Americans who did not want to become communists.
[00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.654]  They were going to establish re-education centers in the Southwest, and if people refused to convert to communism, they would have to be eliminated.
[00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:39.561]  And the people who were not going to be eliminated that were in these camps would have to be re-educated into a new way of thinking.
[00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:42.505]  So, where are these camps?
[00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.927]  Where are these people going to be re-educated at?
[00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.010]  Well, it's FEMA camps, actually.
[00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.075]  And Alex breaks this down really well in his film, Police State 4, Rise of FEMA.
[00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.357]  We're going to go to a clip from that now.
[00:04:56.354 --> 00:05:06.698]  New legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United States and it says six major camps across the country with hundreds of sub-region camps.
[00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:15.842]  Now if you watch my films and read the documents we put out, that's exactly what we said the camps are and how they operate because we reverse-engineered all this.
[00:05:16.963 --> 00:05:17.984]  The camps are already built.
[00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:22.688]  It's when they want to openly announce they're doing it that they then pass a law.
[00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:37.482]  And they say, oh, all these shut down military bases that they've been keeping refurbished and putting barbed wire facing in and putting in showers and bunks, we knew that those were to be the FEMA camps.
[00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:40.664]  Because in the FEMA documents and in congressional leaks,
[00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:44.006]  And from people that worked at the camps, we knew.
[00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:45.427]  And we would list the camps.
[00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:58.772]  Then we noticed, when it was declassified in 97, that the very camps that had been, quote, decommissioned under the base closure, because they'd said back in the 80s, under Rex 84, they were going to use the camps in Congress.
[00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:00.833]  So we said, you want to know where the camps are?
[00:06:00.873 --> 00:06:06.516]  They're old military bases, and they're old POW camps from Italians, Germans, and Japanese.
[00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:09.057]  Guess what's in here?
[00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:11.291]  Guess what's in the bill?
[00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:31.990]  So the National Emergency Centers Act, or HR 645, actually mandates the establishment of national emergency centers to be located on military installations for the purpose of providing temporary housing, medical and humanitarian assistance in the event of an emergency or major disaster.
[00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.251]  But the bill also mentions that these camps can be used to meet other appropriate needs as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
[00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.072]  They don't talk about what those other appropriate needs are.
[00:06:42.832 --> 00:06:56.279]  But, these camps will double as command and control centers, and they will house a 24-7 operations watch center, and the bill contains language that authorizes these camps to be established within closed or already operating military bases throughout the country.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:08.646]  And as we know, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root was awarded a $400 million contract back in 2006 to construct detention and processing facilities for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:15.850]  Now, if you move on just a little bit further, the Army National Guard began advertising for internment specialists.
[00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:24.956]  Internment and resettlement specialists that would ensure the smooth running of military confinement, correctional facilities, or detention and internment facilities.
[00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:31.040]  And some of the specific duties included counseling individual prisoners in rehabilitative programs.
[00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:39.106]  And under advanced responsibilities you see there, it actually says, for the custody and control and operation of an enemy prisoner of war or civilian internee.
[00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:40.647]  We're good to go.
[00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:14.461]  And it also mentions Army Regulation 210-35 entitled Civilian Inmate Labor Program, which provides guidance for establishing and managing civilian inmate labor programs on Army installations and guidance on establishing prison camps on Army installations.
[00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:15.801]  So they all go hand in hand.
[00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:23.944]  Now, fast forward a little bit further to this year when InfoWars reported on a leaked Army re-education camp manual.
[00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:34.024]  A shocking Army manual that described how political activists in prison camps will be indoctrinated by specially assigned psychological operations officers.
[00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:49.717]  And it goes through and talks about how PSYOP teams would use indoctrination programs to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes, as well as targeting political activists with such indoctrination programs to provide an understanding and appreciation of US policies and actions.
[00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:50.398]  That's a quote.
[00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:55.920]  And this manual here includes DHS, it includes ICE and FEMA.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.540]  These are domestic operations.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.662]  And it talks about civil support operations that are going to be done within U.S.
[00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:02.582]  territory.
[00:09:03.302 --> 00:09:04.482]  And it talks about how U.S.
[00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:07.143]  citizens will be confined separately from detainees.
[00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:08.484]  It specifically mentions that.
[00:09:08.804 --> 00:09:11.505]  And it also talks about the prisoner's social security number.
[00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:21.387]  Now, for people who argued that this document was only meant to be used in faraway countries like Afghanistan, Afghanistani people do not have social security numbers, neither do Iraqis.
[00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:26.229]  In fact, most countries do not call their national ID numbers a social security number.
[00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:28.689]  America is one of the few that actually does.
[00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:34.931]  In addition, the manual also states that the authority to approve resettlement, such operations within U.S.
[00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:38.852]  territories would require, quote, a special exception to posse comitatus.
[00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:39.893]  We're good.
[00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:09.657]  And basically, Florida State Senator Don Goetz sent a letter to noted constitutionalist Chris Ann Hall advising her that he agrees with Andrew Jackson when he said, quote, shoot the first nullifier that touches the flag and hang the rest.
[00:10:10.337 --> 00:10:16.021]  Interestingly enough, here at InfoWars, we couldn't find anywhere that actually attributed this quote to Andrew Jackson.
[00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:21.784]  And other people have commented on this story also cannot seem to find that quote attributed to Andrew Jackson anywhere.
[00:10:22.264 --> 00:10:24.646]  But the truth is, we have the right to nullify.
[00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:26.927]  Unconstitutional legislation.
[00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:28.687]  And you hear all this death talk.
[00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:32.929]  They're using these death terms for anyone who doesn't want to get on the bandwagon with collectivism.
[00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.830]  And it's coming out more and more.
[00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:44.953]  Now, in this clip that we have coming up for you for Alex from his film Martial Law, he talks about how communism is basically just another globalist front.
[00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:46.634]  So let's take a look at that clip now.
[00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:53.391]  We've been talking to a lot of the protesters and most of them say Bush bad, Kerry good.
[00:10:54.031 --> 00:11:06.587]  The problem is Bush and Kerry are cousins, Kerry's for the war, and one of the few signs that we've seen that is exposing that both of them work for the same people and are part of a false choice is this communist revolution sign.
[00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:15.531]  But you know, I go back to 1958 when Eisenhower called Fidel Castro the Abraham Lincoln of Latin America.
[00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:26.797]  And so the problem is, is that it was actually the big central banks at the turn of the last century that created communism as a way to try to con the serfs back into serfdom.
[00:11:27.037 --> 00:11:30.119]  So again, another false choice is what we have here.
[00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:31.880]  Bush-Kerry equals more war.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.821]  I agree.
[00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:34.121]  They're corporate fascists.
[00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:34.802]  It's all true.
[00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:40.566]  But then the corporate fascists have funded this as their counter-revolution control valve.
[00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:42.728]  This is the true complexity that we're facing.
[00:11:42.928 --> 00:11:45.350]  And until we figure that out, we're going to lose all our freedoms.
[00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.311]  And they're going to keep winning.
[00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:47.892]  How you doing, ma'am?
[00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:52.335]  Hey, I like the top part of your son.
[00:11:52.355 --> 00:11:53.516]  I agree they're all controlled.
[00:11:53.957 --> 00:11:54.697]  Are you a communist?
[00:11:55.217 --> 00:11:55.538]  Go away.
[00:11:56.378 --> 00:11:57.699]  But it says communist revolution.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.761]  I really don't want to talk to you.
[00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:00.622]  Stop bothering this lady.
[00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:01.963]  What are you worried about?
[00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:03.995]  I'm not!
[00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:04.556]  What did you say?
[00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:05.276]  I didn't hear you.
[00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:06.638]  How can you say that?
[00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:07.919]  How can I say what?
[00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:09.280]  Very nasty what you just said.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.042]  Did you hear what he just said?
[00:12:11.882 --> 00:12:13.464]  Did you hear what this guy just said?
[00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:14.885]  He said something terribly nasty.
[00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:16.987]  That stuff doesn't work anymore.
[00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:17.748]  This is in the 60s.
[00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:19.970]  Look, he's trying to agitate.
[00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:23.799]  This is not the 60s don't happen anymore.
[00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:29.221]  What I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, I'm saying communism, communism, you work for the US government don't you?
[00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:29.981]  This guy's nasty.
[00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:30.681]  Boy he is nasty.
[00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:31.302]  You are nasty.
[00:12:38.464 --> 00:12:39.085]  Oh, the big banks.
[00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:40.166]  This man is from the big banks.
[00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:41.187]  He's from Chase Manhattan.
[00:12:41.207 --> 00:12:42.088]  Chase Manhattan and Citibank.
[00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.911]  And Citibank and Chase Manhattan are part of capitalism.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.421]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Communist for you.
[00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:58.822]  All this info, all propaganda.
[00:12:59.043 --> 00:13:00.323]  It's all part of capitalism.
[00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:02.744]  It's all part of capitalism, isn't it?
[00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:03.925]  You're a capitalist.
[00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:05.366]  You're a capitalist.
[00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:06.306]  You're a capitalist.
[00:13:06.326 --> 00:13:06.566]  The U.S.
[00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:07.707]  government admits they put Mao in.
[00:13:07.747 --> 00:13:08.267]  Capitalist.
[00:13:08.307 --> 00:13:08.527]  The U.S.
[00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:09.428]  government admits they put Mao in.
[00:13:09.448 --> 00:13:10.028]  Capitalist.
[00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:11.909]  You're a capitalist, are you?
[00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:13.750]  How much money do you have on you, capitalist?
[00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.070]  Free markets.
[00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.090]  Free markets?
[00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.071]  What does that mean?
[00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:17.271]  You're capitalist masters.
[00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:18.492]  What does a free market mean?
[00:13:18.532 --> 00:13:20.173]  How long have you been a communist?
[00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:21.013]  What's a free market?
[00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:22.114]  How long have you been a person?
[00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:23.774]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:25.415]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:27.135]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:28.815]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:29.836]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:30.336]  Do what, mate?
[00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:30.876]  Grow up.
[00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:31.656]  Who should?
[00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:32.836]  You should.
[00:13:33.076 --> 00:13:33.257]  Grow up.
[00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:34.117]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:35.057]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:35.077 --> 00:13:36.077]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:36.097 --> 00:13:36.957]  How long have you been a jerk?

[00:13:37.638 --> 00:13:38.398]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:39.098]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:39.938]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:40.758]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:41.719]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:42.519]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:43.359]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:44.159]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:44.899]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:45.779]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:46.840]  How long have you been a jerk?
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.580]  How long have you been a jerk?

[00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.227]  So you guys don't care about facts?
[00:13:54.247 --> 00:13:55.108]  It's all just disinfo?
[00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:55.328]  Good.
[00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:55.808]  Thank you.
[00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.489]  Yeah.
[00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:57.690]  Sounds good to me.
[00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.012]  So, you don't care that Stalin killed 50 million people?
[00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:02.493]  So, yeah.
[00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:03.274]  So what else?
[00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:05.015]  So you don't care?
[00:14:05.195 --> 00:14:06.016]  So who are you?
[00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:06.516]  You killed.
[00:14:07.057 --> 00:14:08.258]  How many people did you kill?
[00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:08.818]  No one.
[00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:13.082]  But your ideas killed millions and millions and millions.
[00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:13.882]  Capitalism.
[00:14:14.823 --> 00:14:15.884]  You're a capitalist.
[00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:17.245]  You're a pro-capitalist.
[00:14:18.783 --> 00:14:21.265]  She wishes we were dead right there.
[00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.106]  This is the one?
[00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:27.229]  She's the one walking around saying she wishes we were dead.
[00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.130]  So you don't care?
[00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:30.351]  So who are you?
[00:14:31.132 --> 00:14:32.333]  How many people did you kill?
[00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:32.893]  No one.
[00:14:33.554 --> 00:14:36.916]  But your ideas killed millions and millions and millions.
[00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:42.087]  So what happens to you after you go to these FEMA camps?
[00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.747]  Is it just a fun little vacation?
[00:14:43.827 --> 00:14:47.228]  Well, actually, let's take a look at this article that came out in The Guardian today.
[00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.809]  CIA tortured and sodomized terror suspect.
[00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:52.549]  Human rights court rules.
[00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.331]  Apparently CIA agents tortured a German citizen, sodomizing, shackling, and beating him.
[00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:06.113]  They seized him in Macedonia in December 2003, and he was handed over to a CIA rendition team and secretly flown to Afghanistan.
[00:15:06.693 --> 00:15:08.456]  And if anything, that should ring true to you.
[00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:18.369]  It should sound a lot like the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, which says you can be whisked away without charge or trial, possibly tortured, no due process whatsoever.
[00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.611]  Sounds a lot like that.
[00:15:19.912 --> 00:15:22.275]  And they actually ruled that that is torture.
[00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:23.497]  So there you have it.
[00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:30.682]  You know, you have people like Harry Belafonte coming out making these claims, and some people can dismiss that and laugh it off, but it's all here in black and white.
[00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:39.409]  The government has planned that entire thing out, about imprisoning anyone who's a political dissident, anyone who disagrees with the continuity of government, with the president.
[00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:46.014]  And so it's all right there, and it's pretty concerning, and I urge everybody to go take a look at these documents at InfoWars.com.
