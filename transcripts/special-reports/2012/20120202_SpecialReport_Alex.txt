[00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:09.734]  Thousands of popular diet and sugar-free foods and beverages contain an artificial sweetener that researchers say may cause cancer.
[00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:17.238]  The ingredient is aspartame, and it is by far the most dangerous substance on the market that is added to our foods.
[00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:22.902]  Aspartame is an artificial sweetener found in thousands of products worldwide.
[00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:25.804]  And chances are, you are consuming it.
[00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:32.009]  It's added to sugar-free gum, juice beverages, tabletop sweeteners like Equal and NutraSweet.
[00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:39.054]  It's in cereals, soft drinks, yogurt, breath mints, multivitamins, wine coolers, and even over-the-counter medicines.
[00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:45.504]  The toxic long-term effects of aspartame are often dismissed as a hoax by the sweetener industry.
[00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:53.036]  However, numerous independent controlled studies using human subjects have concluded that aspartame is deadly.
[00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:04.158]  Now there's a number of studies that claim that aspartame is completely safe to consume, but the vast majority of those studies were conducted by, well, you guessed it, the aspartame industry.
[00:01:04.338 --> 00:01:06.659]  In fact, groups like Monsanto, J.D.
[00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.523]  Searle, and ILSI concluded that aspartame posed no health risk.
[00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:18.348]  But that's about as credible as Marlboro Camel and Winston dismissing the link between cigarette smoking and cancer.
[00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:25.653]  Have you heard of aspartame?
[00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:27.253]  Yes, I've heard of it before.
[00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:28.574]  Have you heard good things or bad things?
[00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:30.474]  I hear mostly bad things about it.
[00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:31.975]  What kind of bad things?
[00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:35.896]  Just like it's an artificial sweetener and it's bad for your health and you should try to stay away.
[00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:40.457]  I've heard it's an artificial sweetener and I'm guilty of drinking beverages sweetened with it.
[00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.578]  However, it degenerates and it does harmful things.
[00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:45.758]  What do you think about aspartame?
[00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:47.285]  I don't like it.
[00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.526]  It gives me headaches.
[00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.747]  They did studies on rats.
[00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.510]  It supposedly causes cancer.
[00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.938]  Even Fox News recently reported in 2005 that artificial sweeteners had been linked to a wide range of cancers after studying involving rats.
[00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:06.961]  So these rats actually had tumors the size of golf balls.
[00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.982]  So does that concern you when you hear stuff like that?
[00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:10.103]  Greatly, yes.
[00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:15.688]  And the FDA is supposed to be protecting us from things like cancer, not giving it to us and telling us it's safe.
[00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:22.929]  You cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.162]  In the 1970s, Searle tried to get it approved, and they couldn't.
[00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:29.623]  It took them three separate times.
[00:02:30.163 --> 00:02:36.706]  Because in their own studies with monkeys, large portions of them that were fed it died and contracted cancer.
[00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:51.594]  Now we have mainstream news articles, and the EU has done a major study, finding lower birth weights, early birth, and yes, miscarriages from women that drink aspartame-laden soft drinks like Coke Zero.
[00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:53.976]  Do you think that aspartame should be on the market today?
[00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:55.457]  No.
[00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:56.718]  Why not?
[00:02:57.238 --> 00:03:00.041]  Because it hasn't been demonstrated to be safe.
[00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:06.045]  The FDA looked at the research, and in 1975, put aspartame's approval on hold.
[00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.488]  It set up an independent panel of doctors to study aspartame.
[00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:15.653]  In 1980, that public board of inquiry unanimously ruled aspartame should not go on the market.
[00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.016]  Edith was drinking a cup of low-calorie hot chocolate that night.
[00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:20.397]  Aspartame made it sweet.
[00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:23.558]  And Johnson says aspartame made her sick.
[00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:25.099]  All of a sudden, I couldn't see.
[00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.860]  My eyes went out of focus and it was like my vision became quite blurred.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.501]  And you think it's because of aspartame?
[00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:34.262]  I think it's very deliberately because of aspartame, yes.
[00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:35.583]  It was terrifying.
[00:03:36.063 --> 00:03:38.264]  Kate Randall thought she was going crazy.
[00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:46.327]  I started popping in my hands and twitching in my feet, my legs, my knees, my upper legs and shoulders and arms and everywhere.
[00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.848]  Many of these individuals have been aspartame reactors.
[00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.743]  Have tested themselves 5, 10, 20 times.
[00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:57.804]  Every time getting the same response.
[00:03:57.864 --> 00:04:03.067]  And then they realized that this was a legitimate cause and effect relationship.
[00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.307]  What is aspartame?
[00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:08.109]  It is the fecal matter of the E. coli bacteria.
[00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.750]  They took it and genetically engineered it.
[00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.872]  They can feed it toxic waste and then it defecates aspartame.
[00:04:14.052 --> 00:04:16.893]  And it has so many bad health effects, it's just unspeakable.
[00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.993]  How do you think a product like that was managed to be approved by the FDA?
[00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:24.675]  Oh, I think there's loopholes to everything.
[00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:26.276]  I say shut the FDA down.
[00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:30.139]  Shut down any government agency that's not doing its job.
[00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.620]  Would you think that possibly the FDA is corrupt?
[00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:35.362]  I'm gonna go ahead and say no.
[00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:38.324]  I trust the FDA with my health.
[00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:40.626]  Do you think there's a chance the FDA could be corrupt?
[00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:45.189]  About as big a chance as any other part of our government.
[00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:55.409]  Now the FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested and subject to multiple congressional hearings and scientific criticism.
[00:04:55.929 --> 00:05:03.196]  In fact, aspartame was continuously rejected by the FDA for over 15 years until it was finally approved in 1981.
[00:05:04.818 --> 00:05:18.226]  Since that time, the FDA has published a list of 92 symptoms of aspartame poisoning, which includes headaches, vision loss, including blindness, seizures, neurological problems, cardiovascular problems, and death.
[00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:27.051]  The FDA even admits adverse reactions to aspartame comprise about 80% of consumer complaints it receives each year.
[00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:33.515]  Yet the dangerous substance remains on the market and is consumed by millions of people every single day.
