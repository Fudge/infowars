[00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.942]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:14.262]  Well, the U.S.
[00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:19.223]  carbon tax is back on the table, and if Al Gore has his way, it's coming soon to a bank account near you.
[00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:30.545]  Following on the heels of Hurricane Sandy and the re-election of President Barack Obama, the Congressional Budget Office this week released a report all about how low-income families can now afford a carbon tax.
[00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:38.007]  Conservative and liberal think tanks alike have jumped on the bandwagon, hosting all-day panels on the topic and putting out white papers.
[00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:47.247]  And right on time, here comes Al Gore openly calling on President Obama to institute a carbon tax to save us all from the fiscal cliff budget crisis.
[00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:52.330]  In addition, Gore also premiered another 24 hours of reality, a dirty weather report.
[00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.694]  Across the globe, cataclysmic weather events are occurring with such regularity that it's being called a new normal.
[00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.395]  But there's nothing normal about it.
[00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:05.057]  And there's something else that lies destroyed amid the rubble.
[00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.259]  The truth about climate change.
[00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:19.462]  Where he urges people to go to his Climate Reality Project website to sign up to, quote, change the world by becoming an Al Gore climate leader, educating people on Gore's brand of environmentalism.
[00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:25.863]  The website actually says, climate change is not your fault for the car you drive, the lights you turn on, or the food you eat.
[00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:28.263]  The climate crisis is our problem.
[00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.944]  So apparently we can all fix our problem together.
[00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:35.125]  All we have to do is pay Al Gore carbon taxes.
[00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:49.269]  Now, if climate change could be attributed to the lights you turn on, as Gore puts it, perhaps he would be at the top of the list, considering in just one year, his mansion used a quarter of a million kilowatt hours, amounting in $30,000 in utility bills.
[00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.134]  Utility bills Gore will easily be able to pay if carbon taxes go through, as he stands to make billions.
[00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:58.316]  As InfoWars has extensively reported,
[00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:00.716]  Man-made global warming is a hoax.
[00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:09.144]  It's based on shady science that's propagated to institute a one-world government through money-making schemes like cap-and-trade and carbon taxes.
[00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:16.672]  Maybe Al Gore thinks if he repeats this scare mantra over and over again, we'll finally believe it and pay him some carbon taxes.
[00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:22.295]  Now, on a side note, do you remember the 1990s environmental cartoon Captain Planet?
[00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:40.831]  In it, five youths from all across the globe called Planeteers would get together to fight pollution and capitalism, and when their powers combined, it would summon Earth's greatest champion, Captain Planet, a magical blue guy with a green mullet who would come in to save the day and tell kids the power is yours when it came to saving the Earth.
[00:02:48.816 --> 00:03:03.150]  Fun fact about Captain Planet, it was actually co-created by elite billionaire eugenicist Ted Turner, who's gone on record to say the Earth needs to be cut down to two billion people and a global one-child policy should be instituted even though he himself has five children.
[00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:05.793]  You have to wonder, was Captain Planet
[00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:09.837]  Some kind of globalist propaganda programming on a massive scale.
[00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:24.911]  As the elementary and middle school students who used to come home from school and watch Captain Planet on TV every day are now the adults who turn on the TV every day that tells them that man-made global warming is killing the earth and so is overpopulation and only they can do something to fix it.
[00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:29.238]  And what's more, does Al Gore somehow think he's the real-life Captain Planet?
[00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:39.613]  I mean, after all, he's swooping in to save the Earth with his carbon taxes, and the UN even named him Champion of the Earth in 2007, much like Captain Planet is called Earth's Greatest Champion.
[00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:49.791]  In addition, Gore's website tells us that by uniting our voices, we have the power to change the world, just like Captain Planet says, with your powers combined, before he saves the planet.
[00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:57.696]  And after all, yesterday's Captain Planet planeteer wannabes now have the opportunity to become today's Al Gore climate leaders.
[00:03:58.256 --> 00:04:05.380]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the power is yours to save the Earth, and according to Al Gore, all you have to do is pay him some carbon taxes.
