[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.390]  Governor Johnson, you're on the ballot in 47 states.
[00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.273]  47 states right now, three to go, and we're litigated in the three, and we believe we're going to prevail in the three, but we'll see.
[00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.053]  Great, great.
[00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:21.598]  And I think it's important to point that out because there are other third parties, but I believe the Green Party at a maximum is going to be at 30 states, so that kind of puts it into perspective.
[00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:22.218]  Wow, wow.
[00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:23.279]  What about the Constitutional Party?
[00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.079]  How far do they play?
[00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:25.920]  My understanding is about eight.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.200]  Wow, wow.
[00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.361]  So a significant difference.
[00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.582]  Roseanne Barr's party, whatever that is, I understand that's a two.
[00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.103]  Now, you're a two-term governor of New Mexico.
[00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:37.444]  Two-term, former governor of New Mexico.
[00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:42.025]  So you actually have more executive experience than both Obama and Romney combined, right?
[00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:42.285]  Right.
[00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:47.967]  And what's important there is I think my executive experience is that I vetoed stuff.
[00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:49.668]  I mean, I said no to government.
[00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:52.869]  Now, New Mexico's a state that's two-to-one Democrat.
[00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.791]  I made a name for myself being a penny pincher.
[00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:58.994]  I made a name for myself saying no to bigger government.
[00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:00.956]  The government doesn't have the solutions.
[00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:08.143]  I should have gotten ridden out on a rail, but I got re-elected by a bigger margin the second time than the first time.
[00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:15.291]  I just think it speaks volumes to the fact that people really appreciate good stewardship of tax dollars.
[00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:38.636]  So that said, over the course of this last presidential campaign election, they did a poll on favorabilities of all the presidential candidates in their home states.
[00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:45.862]  There was only one presidential candidate that was viewed favorably in his or her own state.
[00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:55.454]  And how does that equate in New Mexico?
[00:01:55.835 --> 00:02:00.049]  In New Mexico, I'm waved at with all five fingers, not just one.
[00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:07.987]  I guess one of the policy issues that I think is being ignored unjustly is the TSA and what's happening there.
[00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:16.770]  And I've seen that the Republican platform, they call for the privatization of the TSA, but Romney has been silent on it.
[00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.492]  As a matter of fact, he's got TSA at his events, you know, scanning and searching people and that sort of thing at multiple events.
[00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:28.554]  But I see that you called on your website, you called for the TSA to be
[00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:31.575]  To not have a monopoly on airport security.
[00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.996]  How would that differ from, say, privatizing it?
[00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:36.818]  In essence, that would be privatizing.
[00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:45.502]  I would like to point out that if I would have been President of the United States after 9-11, I would have never established the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:48.643]  I would have never established the TSA, ever.
[00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:54.106]  I would have left airport security to the airports, to the municipalities, to the airlines.
[00:02:55.006 --> 00:03:01.309]  I think that today, airport security would be less intrusive and as safe.
[00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.031]  And maybe some airlines would opt for strip naked.
[00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:07.492]  Strip naked, walk through, walk through.
[00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.533]  And maybe there would be a market for that.
[00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:10.634]  I wouldn't be in that.
[00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:12.034]  I would not be in that.
[00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.715]  I would not be flying that airline.
[00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:19.158]  I would be flying the airline that I could walk through a metal detector, hopefully at a brisk pace.
[00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.766]  Well, let me ask you, the other thing that you said on your website, you said, only high-risk individuals should be subjected to invasive pat-downs of full-body scans.
[00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:32.150]  Who would decide who the high-risk individuals are?
[00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.731]  Would that be TSA employees?
[00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:36.194]  Well, no, so back to privatization.
[00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:42.340]  So, speaking hypothetically, if I were in charge, and by the way, I may end up being in charge of TSA,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.782]  If I'm elected President of the United States, I would like to see TSA abolished.
[00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:53.125]  But if they don't give me that legislation to abolish TSA, then, administratively, I'm going to control TSA.
[00:03:53.525 --> 00:04:00.828]  I just guarantee you, it will be less intrusive, it will be as safe, and we could implement techniques that are used by other countries.
[00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:02.069]  Israel, for example.
[00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.651]  There's also health issues, too.
[00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:14.017]  I don't know if you're aware of the fact that the European Commission has just stopped their evaluation of our scanners and is not going to approve them for their airports.
[00:04:14.077 --> 00:04:16.398]  And one of the things they were concerned about was x-ray.
[00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.581]  And there's also been a cancer cluster of TSA agents in Boston.
[00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.682]  So I guess, you know,
[00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:30.408]  Is there some way that, as president, if you've got an agency that makes it a prerequisite to fly, that you have to be x-rayed?
[00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:38.195]  You know, it makes travel a privilege, or to exercise this privilege, you have to be x-rayed, or you have to be fondled, or whatever.
[00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:41.797]  Is there some way, as president, that you can do an executive order?
[00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:43.899]  Yes, yes, exactly!
[00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.821]  And I would do just that.
[00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:51.986]  I guarantee you that after taking office, in a very, very short amount of time, everybody will be commenting on the fact that
[00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:53.489]  Airport security?
[00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:08.221]  This is short of getting rid of TSA, taking control of TSA, issuing executive orders regarding, and it wouldn't be an executive order, it would be the fact that I'm hiring, I'm going to be hiring the head of TSA.
[00:05:08.802 --> 00:05:14.387]  The rules and regulations that dictate how TSA operates are going to be under my direct control.
[00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:20.470]  And would you approve a situation, what's happening under Obama is that we're seeing mission creep for the TSA.
[00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.153]  I don't know if you're aware of the Viper program, where they're going into bus stations and train stations, that sort of thing.
[00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:26.654]  So I assume that you would not approve of that.
[00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.294]  I would not approve of that at all.
[00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:39.661]  And President Obama, during the State of the State address, when he goes, we're going to have a high-speed train line from one end of the country to the other, and you'll all love the fact that you're not going to have to stand in a line for TSA.
[00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.462]  I'm thinking, baloney!
[00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:46.484]  Absolutely we're going to stand in a TSA line.
[00:05:46.504 --> 00:05:49.626]  We're going to be subject to the same kind of search.
[00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.167]  I call it the Constitution Free Zone.
[00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:57.150]  We're going to be subject to the same Constitution Free Zone that we are today when we go through an airport.
[00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.911]  True, true.
[00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:01.114]  Yeah, it's not the airport security administration, it's transportation.
[00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:03.456]  I think they've got much larger scope in mind.
[00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:08.260]  Getting to another subject, QE3 just came out recently.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.323]  Could you tell us what you think about QE3 and about the Federal Reserve?
[00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:15.767]  Well, so QE3, the Federal Reserve is now going to buy up assets.
[00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:17.886]  What are those assets going to be?
[00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:27.012]  Well, we don't have audit of the Federal Reserve, but we do have the Federal Reserve, so they're going to buy up mortgage-backed securities, they're going to buy up treasuries, they're going to buy up stocks.
[00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:32.436]  Whatever it is they buy are going to rise in price artificially.
[00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:37.559]  So, aren't we creating, isn't the Federal Reserve creating another bubble?
[00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.381]  I would sign legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:43.422]  I think it's an inside job.
[00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:57.930]  I think the fact that the Federal Reserve takes money from Treasury, loans it out to the banks at 0%, the banks don't loan it out to you or I, because the banks can buy up Treasuries and make money on the spread with no risk whatsoever.
[00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.751]  This is an inside game.
[00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:05.973]  And as a result of this inside game, we're paying for this, we're paying for bank profits where there's no risk.
[00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:08.174]  This is not right.
[00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:09.015]  This is wrong.
[00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.736]  So I would sign that legislation.
[00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:21.080]  I would also sign legislation that would repeal legal tender laws allowing for legislation for competing currencies.
[00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.541]  Great, great.
[00:07:23.022 --> 00:07:24.603]  One last question on foreign policy.
[00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:33.632]  With what's happening in Libya, Syria, and the amassing of forces in Iran, what would you do as president with this situation?
[00:07:34.093 --> 00:07:42.441]  Well, I would extricate ourselves militarily from all these situations, and right now I would get ourselves out of these embassies.
[00:07:43.602 --> 00:07:49.488]  Why set ourselves up there as a target in an area where they're looking for targets?
[00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:56.375]  And the target is, for the most part, symbolic, but these symbolic targets end up with four Americans losing their lives.
[00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:59.938]  So, this is not a sign of weakness.
[00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:05.203]  This is a sign of, hey, we've got brains between our ears, and this is places we shouldn't be.
[00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:16.406]  We spend hundreds of millions of dollars propping up a new regime in Libya, and that regime can't protect us in our embassies over there?
[00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:24.335]  Well, if they can't protect us, and that's fine, and that's the observation that I would make as President of the United States, we're going to get out until we're wanted.
[00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:25.637]  I appreciate it.
[00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:27.499]  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us.
[00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:28.239]  Thank you very much.
