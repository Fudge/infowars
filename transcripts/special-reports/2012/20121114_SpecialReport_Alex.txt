[00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:12.785]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.966]  We're here at the Black Ops 2 premiere.
[00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:20.468]  If you've been following InfoWars over the past several weeks, you've seen we've published articles concerning the public perception of drones.
[00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:22.348]  Let's find out what these gamers have to say.
[00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.489]  What's like the new coolest thing about this game?
[00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.930]  Probably all the new zombies.
[00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.931]  I love zombies.
[00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.491]  The gameplay on zombies.
[00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:31.592]  It's gotta be the zombies.
[00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:33.032]  There's gonna be zombies in it.
[00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:33.913]  Zombies are back.
[00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.753]  I love playing zombies.
[00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:38.250]  My reasoning for being here tonight can be summed up in one word.
[00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.330]  Zombies.
[00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.530]  Nazi zombies.
[00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.911]  Playing zombies again.
[00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.011]  Everybody loves zombies.
[00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:44.011]  What is it about zombies?
[00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.272]  It's just, it's just fun.
[00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:50.593]  Have you ever heard that the military actually likes to use games like this sometimes to recruit people?
[00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:57.014]  We've heard the story of a 19-year-old who was actually offered a job by the military as a drone pilot because he got a top score.
[00:00:57.794 --> 00:00:58.755]  So they monitor that?
[00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:00.355]  Yes they do.
[00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:03.956]  When they come knocking on your door, I'm Colonel so-and-so, I want to give you a job, would you take it?
[00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:05.504]  I'm a hacktoon.
[00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:10.125]  If I could do that, I'd do that today if I could, but not to hurt anybody.
[00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:12.246]  I would love the opportunity.
[00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:13.546]  Nah, I couldn't do it.
[00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.106]  I'm not finna hurt America like that.
[00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:18.507]  Man, if I get a job like that, hell yeah, let's do it.
[00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:19.407]  I'm good.
[00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:20.407]  Shoot, who I gotta kill?
[00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:23.188]  What do you think about drone use in the real world?
[00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:24.248]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.069]  I think it's actually pretty good.
[00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.209]  I mean, it keeps our troops safe.
[00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:31.930]  Did you know in Pakistan about 80% of the people killed by drones were non-combatants, pretty much civilians?
[00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.752]  No, I did not know that.
[00:01:34.652 --> 00:01:36.353]  That's not a good news though.
[00:01:36.974 --> 00:01:40.036]  I think any level of civilian casualties is unacceptable.
[00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:44.179]  Our military should be able to be more accurate.
[00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.459]  Damn, I believe it.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.020]  I believe it.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.701]  Pretty messed up.
[00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.884]  They're set to release 30,000 drones here over American skies to surveil us.
[00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:53.365]  And yes they are.
[00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:55.707]  Well, I think it's completely unnecessary.
[00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.829]  I don't see how it's going to make us safer.
[00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:59.650]  That's certainly scary.
[00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.251]  It's actually kind of scary sounding.
[00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:02.252]  I think it's wrong too.
[00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:02.792]  Of course I do.
[00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:03.593]  Of course I do.
[00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:04.494]  But the government's not right.
[00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:05.514]  They do a lot of things we don't like.
[00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:14.101]  I don't see any real problem with drones surveying us per se because it gives us this kind of sense of security.
[00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:18.496]  And I don't necessarily think they're going to be spying in our backyards.
[00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:21.959]  And even if they are, maybe that's not such a bad thing.
[00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.819]  Man, come do it.
[00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:23.180]  Shoot.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.201]  Hell, we get hit, we get hit.
[00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.884]  Like, that'd be kind of cool, just as like, you know, security, defense, whatever.
[00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:32.066]  But like, I don't know, someone hacks into them.
[00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:35.508]  It could be just like in Black Ops 2, and they could all turn against us and kill us.
[00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.071]  Did you know the University of Texas has actually been able to hack a drone using about $1,000 worth of materials?
[00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:42.617]  Have I heard of that?
[00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:43.822]  Yeah.
[00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:44.927]  Actually, no, I have not heard of that.
[00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.841]  That's the main concern if some kids at like UT could do that.
[00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.243]  I mean, you know, terrorists and stuff.
[00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:51.264]  Like, what about that?
[00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:53.726]  Now, do you plan to go to school or work tomorrow?
[00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.327]  Man, I ain't even gonna go to work.
[00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:57.629]  I'm just gonna play my game, that's it.
[00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.690]  And work?
[00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.711]  I don't work tomorrow.
[00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:02.113]  I do, but I'm definitely gonna sleep in.
[00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:03.674]  Yeah, I have class.
[00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:04.195]  I have to go.
[00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:06.357]  Okay, so you're not gonna stay up all night?
[00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.559]  I mean, I'm gonna stay up all night.
[00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.562]  Did you know one of the games they have tonight is a care package that actually comes with a mini drone?
[00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.350]  Yes, I was tempted to get that, but it wasn't quite in my price range.
[00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:23.738]  Some critics say that games like this desensitize people to the real harsh realities of war.
[00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.260]  What do you say to those critics?
[00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:29.805]  I would have to say that their critiques are absolutely 100% correct.
[00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:34.751]  We have absolutely become desensitized to vile actions.
[00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:39.903]  We're outside GameStop about to pick up our Black Ops 2 Care Package in just mere moments.
[00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:45.570]  The Care Package comes with its very own drone, a real remote-controlled drone that you can fly around.
[00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.380]  Now you've heard us at InfoWars talking about drones several times and we basically came to the conclusion that if Big Brother can fly drones on us, we are going to fly drones on them.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.361]  That's why we have
[00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:57.217]  Hashtag Drone Mob.
[00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:03.003]  You can follow us on Twitter to let Big Brother know that, hey, if you're going to keep flying drones on us, we will fly drones on you.
[00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:05.305]  Hashtag Drone Mob for more details.
[00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.847]  We are drones one way or another.
