[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:08.315]  When we talk about the current state of our world, we often liken our existence to books like 1984, Brave New World, or films like They Live.
[00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:12.819]  But recently I was watching that old Sylvester Stallone Wesley Snipes film, The Demolition Man.
[00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:17.663]  And as far-fetched and sci-fi as it may have been at the time, it does ring a little true today.
[00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:20.085]  So let's take a moment and analyze this piece.
[00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:24.608]  Don't you hear a thought repeating in that brain of yours?
[00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:25.289]  A name?
[00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:26.009]  Edgar.
[00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.269]  Edgar.
[00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:35.773]  In short, Stallone and Snipes represent the most brutal aspects of both the police and criminals respectively.
[00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:44.057]  After an incident leaves many innocent people dead, they're both placed into a cryogenic prison and awakened decades later into a complete nanny state.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.721]  Uh, smoking is not good for you.
[00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:52.523]  It has been deemed that anything not good for you is bad.
[00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:53.743]  Hence, illegal.
[00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.465]  Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat.
[00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.226]  Are you sh**ing me?
[00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:02.829]  John Spartan, you are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute.
[00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:04.116]  See what I mean?
[00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:09.558]  And while I'm not an advocate of using coarse language, I'm definitely not a fan of being fined for it either.
[00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:19.902]  Especially when you consider speaking about your lunch, which very well could contain a brown bag and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, can be considered culturally insensitive if not downright racist.
[00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:28.685]  Also, the notion that anything the state deems to be bad for you is illegal, including contact sports and salty foods, but we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:36.235]  In this clip, we see Wesley Snipes visiting a museum to acquire a real gun, the only place he can get one in his fictional timeline.
[00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:44.848]  And that rings true today, because there are people so uptight about gun ownership, they don't even want armed police officers to be able to pick up their own children from school.
[00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.955]  This clip shows the rather cavalier attitude some police officers have when using the supposed non-lethal taser.
[00:01:52.455 --> 00:02:01.223]  Recently here in Texas, a high school student was brain damaged when he dropped to the floor after being shot by a sheriff's taser for an incident he wasn't even involved in.
[00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.245]  You got the salt over there, Bob?
[00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:07.129]  Um, salt is not good for you, hence it is illegal.
[00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:11.074]  No salt even at Taco Bell.
[00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:25.228]  Now if that seems a little too ridiculous to you, remember New York Mayor Bloomberg, who has his campaign to protect you from salt, from soda, this socialist campaign to protect you from everything, all the time, except for this, quote, mythical knockout game.
[00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:32.195]  And we'll end with this, a man who believes in the Constitution, so of course he has to be a dirty, underground sewer dweller.
[00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:33.739]  Because I like to think.
[00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.180]  I like to read.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.582]  I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice.
[00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:44.607]  This fits right in with the narrative that liberty-loving, God-fearing, gun-owning Americans are the bane of the new society.
[00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:50.572]  Intentional or otherwise, Demolition Man is a semi-accurate parody of what's really going on in this country.
[00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:53.494]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:09.753]  This is a conspiracy by the technocrats, by the ruling elite, by the eugenicists that want to dumb us down.
[00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:13.542]  This is the iodine conspiracy.
[00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:23.278]  Our government wasn't always a eugenicist-based predatory group.
[00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:42.649]  Back in the 1920s, the federal government pressured salt manufacturers and bread producers to add iodine because they knew that iodine deficiencies were causing massive decreases in IQ, birth defects, and it was a health crisis all across the United States and in Europe as well.
[00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.032]  In the decade after iodine was added to staple foods,
[00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:53.896]  There was a 15 point increase in IQs in the areas that had previously been deficient.
[00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:57.278]  So what did the federal government do a couple decades later?
[00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:03.041]  They took the good halogen iodine out and added another bad one, bromine.
[00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:13.348]  And they put the worst of the group, fluoride and fluorine derivatives, in our water supply and began using it as a pesticide on the crops.
[00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:15.332]  Let's be clear about this.
[00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:26.997]  Adding bromine to the food supply is banned in the EU, banned in Canada, and banned in many other nations because it is a toxic poison listed in those countries.
[00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:32.279]  I've done deep research on the Globalist program to dumb down the population to make us more manageable.
[00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.299]  It is eugenics.
[00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.681]  And I personally take the highest quality form
[00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:48.448]  of unbound iodine, nascent iodine, in a kosher, certified, non-GMO certified glycerin base.
[00:04:49.148 --> 00:05:02.738]  I've interviewed the experts, people like Dr. Brownstein and pharmacist Ben Fuchs, and of course, Dr. Edward Group, and across the board, the consensus is iodine is the missing piece of the puzzle.
[00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:07.781]  And not just iodine, but high quality, unbound, pure iodine.
[00:05:08.562 --> 00:05:11.966]  Bottom line, this is something on record our bodies need.
[00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:14.669]  I've gone out and found the best source for myself and my family.
[00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.415]  I hope you'll visit MFULWARSLIFE.COM and get our MFULWARSLIFE survival shield.
[00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:24.160]  It really does incredible things and we've got nothing
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.942]  But positive reviews from our listeners.
[00:05:27.383 --> 00:05:38.673]  And this also helps support our news operation and the info war while we get the iodine we need and block the fluoride and the other members of the halogen that are so bad for our bodies.
[00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:40.374]  Check out the information.
[00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:41.976]  Do the research for yourself.
[00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:43.517]  Talk to your physician.
[00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:47.240]  And then decide whether you want to drink fluoridated water
[00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:52.778]  That Harvard major studies admits is giving people brain cancer and bone cancer and lowering their IQ.
[00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:57.121]  Or whether you want to find a high-quality source of iodine.
[00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:01.484]  Consult your physician, do your research, and make a decision.
[00:06:01.565 --> 00:06:04.287]  But whatever you do, don't just ignore this message.
[00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:13.814]  Because all of my research shows this is absolutely key to getting people out of the brain fog that they've been artificially put into by the social engineers.
