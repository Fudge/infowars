[00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:12.335]  I'm Gigi Ornetta reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News, and we're standing here on an overpass at Maynard Drive in Austin, Texas, where people are honking for Obama's impeachment.
[00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:14.796]  So what gave you guys this idea?
[00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.477]  This is a national movement.
[00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:19.798]  It was started by James Neighbors, who's up in Oklahoma.
[00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.060]  We've got groups like this in all 50 states.
[00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:34.748]  And yeah, we're just out here trying to raise people's awareness a little bit and get them woken up to what's going on with the Obama administration and try to get him out of office.
[00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:38.293]  So you believe that these are definitely not phony scandals?
[00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:39.376]  Definitely not.
[00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:40.436]  They're felonies.
[00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:45.320]  And we elect these folks to govern us, but not to rule us.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.364]  And we have a constitution to limit the federal government's power, and they're just shredding the constitution.
[00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:52.985]  Daily.
[00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:57.868]  I want to know how many people are out there that would like to be doing something.
[00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:04.273]  They get frustrated, they say, well, I'm going to do something tomorrow, and I'm going to do something today.
[00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:05.994]  Something that's going to count.
[00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:12.675]  You know, you gotta get out of the, from behind the computer and go out and try to get some things done.
[00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:19.581]  We're in a neighborhood where people actually told us, oh no, you don't want to go out there, you know, there are too many people for Obama out there.
[00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:23.185]  But we're getting a great response and we're going to stay out here as long as we can.
[00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:24.846]  I'm going to be out here every chance I get.
[00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.348]  I took off work for this today.
[00:01:26.368 --> 00:01:29.891]  I mean, I'd take off work if I was sick or if I had a sick child.
[00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:31.579]  The Republic's sick.
[00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.579]  It needs help.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.980]  That's what I'm here for.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.721]  One group near Los Angeles has 1,780 people.
[00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:40.401]  1,780 people.
[00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:41.482]  That's incredible.
[00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:41.982]  One group.
[00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:47.383]  And if you go to overpasses.org, you can find out more information about the event they're having August 17th.
[00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:48.563]  Get out and help.
[00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:51.624]  Help change what's happening to our Constitution.
[00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:55.285]  I'm Gigi Ornette reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
