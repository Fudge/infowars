[00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:20.913]  Our Hutto Police Department, Hutto ISD, Hutto Fire and Rescue, Williamson County have come together to do a preparedness drill for an event that may or may not happen at our schools.
[00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:29.757]  We're trying to prepare first responders, staff and administrators on what our first steps are given a situation like this.
[00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:31.818]  How did you find out about this drill?
[00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:40.153]  I'm a resident of Hutto and we have a citizen police academy.
[00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.074]  So who are you guys?
[00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:44.677]  This is Williamson County EMS, or the tactical medic team.
[00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:46.698]  And by tactical you mean what?
[00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:47.980]  Do you guys go in with the police?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.840]  Do you have firearms?
[00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.281]  No, we do not have firearms.
[00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:50.862]  We're unarmed.
[00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:59.009]  We have received tactical training, SWAT school and tactical medic school, which has allowed for us to go inside of structures with the SWAT team.
[00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.131]  How long have you been working with the tactical team?
[00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:02.596]  Four years.
[00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:03.297]  Four years?
[00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:03.697]  Yes, sir.
[00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:05.199]  How many of these drills have you done?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.221]  This is the first of its kind in the county.
[00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.263]  And you said you've been working about four years.
[00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:11.724]  Why now for this type of drill?
[00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.928]  I'm guessing it's just what's been happening a lot lately around the country.
[00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.250]  I notice different teams are going in at different times.
[00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.312]  Is it the set drill every time or does everything change?
[00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:23.014]  It changes each time.
[00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:28.779]  For those of us that are the actual responders, we don't know what's going to be in the school when we go in.
[00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.700]  We've heard that the Department of Homeland Security is doing drills in Central Texas.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.181]  Does this have anything to do with that?
[00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:39.484]  This is a local drill that we've put together with just our regional area.
[00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:47.469]  There have been incidents all across the country and one of the things we want to do is prepare should something like that come to Hutto.
[00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:58.498]  Is it true that the Department of Homeland Security was here to observe the event?
[00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.058]  No, sir.
[00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.940]  That's not true?
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.380]  No, sir.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.181]  Not that I saw.
[00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:01.702]  They were never here.
[00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:05.727]  Is it true that the Department of Homeland Security was here to observe this event this morning?
[00:02:06.207 --> 00:02:07.189]  To my knowledge, no, sir.
[00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:13.194]  It's important to note that while working on this report, we received an email from the representative we spoke to earlier.
[00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:20.318]  She told us that she misunderstood us when we said DHS to the Department of Homeland Security and thought we were speaking about another entity.
[00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:24.960]  To clarify, she is saying that DHS to the Department of Homeland Security was not in attendance.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.681]  I'm Ja'Kari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:32.463]  Stop by the InfoWars shop and pick up the complete Police State Collection.
[00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:34.604]  Four films of documented tyranny.
