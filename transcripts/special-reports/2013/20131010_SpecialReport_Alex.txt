[00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:08.187]  It's time for some good news.
[00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:12.570]  Austinites can now opt out of the electronic spy grid... for a price.
[00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.993]  Austin Energy has offered customers a smart meter opt-out program.
[00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:24.598]  It'll cost $75 to swap the smart meter for an analog meter, plus a charge to have a meter reader come to your home.
[00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:36.746]  Now, these opt-out fees were voted on by the Austin City Council, and it's a testament to having a publicly owned utility that's accountable to its taxpayers and doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the Texas Public Utilities Commission.
[00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:43.207]  The opt-out program fees from power companies to other Texas residents are nothing less than extortion.
[00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:55.010]  Some American electric power customers in Texas will pay more than $350 to replace a smart meter with an old analog meter and up to $35 a month recurring fee.
[00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.770]  Texas Encore customers are in for even greater sticker shock.
[00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.271]  Encore could charge as much as $842 to make the switch, plus a monthly fee of $25.
[00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:14.457]  But the Smart Meter program is not mandatory, so how can the utility companies introduce an opt-out when the public never actually opted in?
[00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:17.099]  Aren't property rights the ultimate opt-out?
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.705]  Well, if two Democratic members of Congress get their way, the program will become mandatory via the Smart Grid Advancement Act.
[00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.188]  It was introduced earlier this year by Congressmen Jerry McNerney and Matt Cartwright.
[00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:37.174]  Under the Smart Grid Advancement Act, all electricity providers will be required to join the smart grid and install smart meters for customers nationwide.
[00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:46.521]  If it's successfully passed, we might see even more symptoms reported nationwide, like those experienced by homeowners who've already had smart meters installed.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.688]  Muscle contractions that my husband and I were having, involuntary muscle contractions, inflammation, headaches, insomnia, concentration problems, swelling, chest pains.
[00:01:56.068 --> 00:01:57.910]  Think about your bloods being damaged.
[00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.172]  Your oxygen transfer is not happening.
[00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.455]  They did a live blood analysis of red blood cells.
[00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:08.019]  They pulled people's blood before they put them in front of a smart meter and the red blood cells look normal.
[00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.883]  Then they put the people in front of a smart meter for about two minutes, about two feet away.
[00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:16.244]  It was shocking, Alex, what the blood results showed.
[00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:21.985]  The red blood cells had ruptured, they were distorted, and they started stacking up upon each other.
[00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:26.246]  So think of the iron in your blood as an antenna, alright?
[00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:26.826]  It's a metal.
[00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.107]  So that's why the red blood cells... And there's iron!
[00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:29.727]  That's right.
[00:02:29.787 --> 00:02:32.747]  That's why the red blood cells are so susceptible, okay?
[00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:38.608]  And so what's interesting is a signature of health issues is anemia.
[00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.109]  My husband and I both had anemia.
[00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:47.012]  In addition to those health warnings, smart meters are a search without a warrant every single day.
[00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:50.094]  Its primary intention is to transmit data.
[00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:54.036]  It receives data from smart appliances, which will be in your home.
[00:02:54.636 --> 00:03:07.243]  And they will be communicating to the meter everything that's going on in your home through the use of RFID technology, through the use of new technology like Verizon's Smart TV, which has the apparent capabilities to detect
[00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:22.332]  Facial recognition, speech, and even, you know, the moods of rooms and what's being said, how it's being said, so that they can, you know, then immediately push back to you what they feel that you need in that moment for advertising purposes.
[00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:24.333]  It's not giving us more control.
[00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:36.660]  It's actually giving the control to big corporations, to utilities, and to governments who will be sharing in this data that is basically being extracted from the home in a very, very high level of detail.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.025]  So while it may be pricey for your family to opt out of the Smart Meter program, the value of your life and liberty is far greater.
[00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:48.168]  Don't allow corporations to pave a perilous path right into your home.
[00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:56.593]  Take back your power today by picking up a copy of this impactful DVD at the InfoWars store and investigate the smart grid for yourself.
[00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:00.676]  How much is your city charging you to opt out of the Smart Meter program?
[00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:02.598]  Let us know in the comments below.
[00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:05.980]  Reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
