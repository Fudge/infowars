[00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:15.236]  This was a heinous and cowardly act, and given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism.
[00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:21.759]  Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.
[00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.729]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this is an InfoWars special report.
[00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:40.172]  The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are authorized only against specific senior Al Qaeda leaders and their associates that were directly involved with the September 11th terror attacks and those who pose an imminent threat to America.
[00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:49.554]  This is in direct contrast to the findings reported last week by McClatchy, who reviewed top secret intelligence documents obtained by their national security reporter.
[00:00:50.114 --> 00:01:02.937]  The documents show that drone strikes in Pakistan over a four-year period didn't meet those standards of authorization, and at times, the CIA killed people who were only suspected or who probably belonged to militant groups.
[00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:18.540]  McClatchy found that during a 12-month period ending September 2011, at least 265 of the 482 people estimated to have been killed by the CIA were not senior al-Qaeda leaders, but instead were assessed as Afghan,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:33.583]  The report also lists killing of Afghan insurgents whose organization wasn't on the U.S.
[00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:37.324]  list of suspected terrorist groups at the time of the 9-11 strikes.
[00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:46.926]  43 of 95 drone strikes reviewed for that period hit groups including unidentified individuals described as foreign fighters and other militants.
[00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:56.788]  In a June 2011 talk at John Hopkins University in Washington, CIA head and drone mastermind John Brennan said that the U.S.
[00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.170]  is exceptionally precise and surgical in terms of addressing the terrorist threat.
[00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:12.776]  And by that I mean, if there are terrorists who are within an area where there are women and children or others, you know, we do not take such action that might put those innocent men, women and children in danger.
[00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:22.740]  He added that in the last year, there hadn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.664]  Accordingly, the reports McClatchy reviewed estimated there was a single civilian casualty, an individual killed in an April 22, 2011 strike in North Waziristan.
[00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:43.772]  However, according to a report by the BBC of that exact strike, out of the 25 casualties, 5 women and 4 children were killed in a nearby house.
[00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:53.658]  A 2011 investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found at least 10 individual attacks in which 45 or more civilians appeared to have died.
[00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:57.721]  Pitch Interactive created this graphic showing the casualties of children,
[00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:04.404]  We only authorize a particular operation against a specific individual if we have a high degree of confidence that the individual being targeted is indeed the terrorist we are pursuing.
[00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:29.518]  Contrary to the CIA's position that civilian casualties have been exceedingly rare, the documents show that drone operators weren't always certain who they were killing.
[00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:37.095]  In light of these facts, the deadly potentiality of domestic drones is even more pressing.
[00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:51.021]  The mass introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles is set to sweep the national airspace by 2015, yet our government has yet to set the rules by which the President is authorized to target civilians on American soil.
[00:03:51.902 --> 00:03:56.104]  The 12-hour filibuster in March by Senator Rand Paul highlighted this issue.
[00:03:56.984 --> 00:03:59.245]  I think we should all judge as inadequate
[00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:09.279]  The President's response when he says he hasn't killed Americans in America yet, he doesn't intend to, but that he might.
[00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.860]  I don't think that that is a response that we should tolerate.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.421]  We also know that we have targeted people for sympathizing with the enemy.
[00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.722]  We've had many people who have dissented in our country.
[00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:25.623]  We've had people in our country who have been against the Afghan war, against the Iraq war.
[00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:27.644]  I was opposed to the Iraq war.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.001]  What are the criteria for who will be killed?
[00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.702]  Could political dissent be part of the standard for drone strikes?
[00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:38.062]  And you say, well, that's ridiculous.
[00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:47.985]  We have listed people already on websites and said that they were risk for terrorism for their political beliefs.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:01.629]  Considering the recent media spin targeting patriots and then lumping them in the same category as Al-Qaeda, are we not setting the stage for drones to be used freely on American soil against those with dissenting opinions?
[00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.311]  Can you kill non-combatants?
[00:05:05.312 --> 00:05:08.434]  And people say, well, a president would never kill non-combatants.
[00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:12.237]  The problem is, is that's who we're killing overseas.
[00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:16.600]  Reports show that 98% of the casualties from U.S.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.241]  drone strikes are civilians.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.044]  Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.
[00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:28.567]  So by his own definition, does Obama consider himself a terrorist?
[00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:32.190]  I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo, and this has been an InfoWars Special Report.
[00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:39.095]  Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a new order.
[00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:44.960]  It is not new, and it is not order.
