[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.253]  When privacy rights are under attack, what do we do?
[00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:05.054]  Stand up, fight back!
[00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:07.276]  When privacy rights are under attack, what do we do?
[00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.098]  Stand up, fight back!
[00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:11.060]  When privacy rights are under attack, what do we do?

[00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:18.368]  Again, this is Matthew Bailey, Austin citizen, student at the University of Texas, U.S.
[00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:22.712]  Army veteran, recipient of the Bronze Star with the V-Device and the Combat Infantryman's Badge while in Iraq.
[00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:32.144]  I want to talk about what's going on in our country today, and one of the things that no one is even aware of, it seems to me, is the Farm Bill that's in the House of Representatives that's about to be passed.
[00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:35.769]  Okay, does anyone realize that
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.103]  We're about to sign up for nearly a trillion dollars of expenditures over the next 10 years.

[00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:03.982]  Shut
[00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:07.353]  My name is Chris Davis.
[00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:09.074]  I'm with the Prior Service Army.
[00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:14.697]  I'm here with the pro-Second Amendment rally and the support of the other rallies that we're having out here in Austin today.
[00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:21.940]  We're out here to protest the tyranny that the government is bringing down upon us in every which way.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.361]  The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, all the way down to the 10th Amendment.
[00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:24.861]  What do we do?
[00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.022]  Stand up, fight back!
[00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:28.303]  Our privacy rights are under attack.
[00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:29.203]  What do we do?
[00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.484]  Stand up, fight back!
[00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.753]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:45.959]  He asked me to not have a magazine in my firearm in order to, you know, not cause any tension.
[00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.523]  I respected that and that's what I've decided to do.
[00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:54.364]  And was your firearm loaded?
[00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:55.285]  Negative, sir.
[00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:59.528]  It was a loaded magazine but there wasn't a round in the chamber.
[00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:09.992]  Our different groups are meeting for different reasons, basically supporting different solutions.
[00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:19.521]  I believe, I think we all believe, that this 4th of July is not a time to celebrate American freedoms, but to re-establish them.
[00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.333]  I think that as my generation matures, it's only going to get worse.
[00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:38.279]  So I think we've got to take a stand now before something more drastic has to happen.
[00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.581]  I think this is a peaceful revolution today.
[00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:40.921]  Fourteen.
[00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:51.392]  What do we want?
[00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:51.953]  Now!
[00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:52.994]  What do we want?
[00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:53.956]  Fourth Amendment!
[00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:54.937]  When do we want it?
[00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:55.138]  Now!
