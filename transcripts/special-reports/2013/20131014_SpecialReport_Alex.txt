[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.249]  My name's Dave Matheny.
[00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.170]  I'm the owner of Silencer Shop.
[00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.411]  For the people who don't know, what is a silencer or suppressor?
[00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.892]  A suppressor is just like the muffler on your car.
[00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.735]  In fact, the first car mufflers were actually firearm silencers that had been attached to cars to make them quieter.
[00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.617]  Now, the technology in car mufflers has moved on, partially because they're not so heavily regulated.
[00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:27.380]  But essentially, all it is, is taking the expanding gases that create the blast out of the end of the muzzle and allowing them to
[00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.181]  Expand and expansion chambers and essentially lessen the sound.
[00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.062]  The silencers, they're not silent, right?
[00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:39.923]  In fact, in a lot of cases what you're really shooting for is hearing safe.
[00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:48.686]  And I've read a lot, like on that Wall Street Journal article, there were people would comment, that's horrible to have a silencer because I want to hear you coming if you're shooting at me.
[00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:57.993]  And what they don't realize, even in that article it mentioned like on an AR-15 with a top of the line suppressor, you're quieting the gun down to the level of a jackhammer.
[00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:05.419]  Now these are your typical AR-15 suppressors, 5.56mm on this left hand side, or your right hand side of the case.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.303]  These are all going to be quick attach, so they'll just quick attach onto an AR-15.
[00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.246]  Do you think all this new regulation is necessary?
[00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:15.392]  Oh, not at all.
[00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:22.077]  Basically what you're talking about, with suppressors in general, it probably is the most highly regulated item in the firearms market already.
[00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:29.162]  And when you consider that it's really nothing more than a safety device, the regulation that's already there could be considered to be kind of ridiculous.
[00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:30.904]  This is a .338 Lapua.
[00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.125]  It's a Desert Tactical.
[00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:42.227]  This gun is so loud without a silencer that it literally goes off the top level of our sound meter, which maxes out around 175-180 decibels.
[00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:45.728]  With that suppressor, it's hearing safe and quieter than a .22.
[00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:47.168]  Quieter than a .22?
[00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:48.069]  Quieter than a .22.
[00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.749]  By a lot.
[00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:53.710]  Explain to us the difference between having a Class 3 license or the trust that you do.
[00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:58.437]  Well, a Class 3 license is a license to sell silencers.
[00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:01.160]  So, for example, we would have a Class 3 license.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.501]  We sell a lot of silencers.
[00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.964]  When you purchase a suppressor, there are three ways to register it.
[00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.928]  The most restrictive way to register is as an individual.
[00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:12.732]  Because if you register as an individual, it really is tied to you as a person.
[00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.253]  So let's say you buy one.
[00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:19.755]  As an individual, your wife uses it on a home defense gun when you're not home, that's a felony.
[00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:24.817]  So, what a lot of people do in order to deal with situations like that is to use a trust.
[00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:34.039]  So, you set up a trust, really simple thing to set up, you add your family members to it, and then anybody who's listed in the trust as a trustee can have independent possession.
[00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.540]  What they're talking about, they're talking about the gun trust loophole.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.722]  They fill out all the paperwork that goes directly to the ATF and sits there for seven to eight months before it gets approved.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.601]  I don't know if it's just me, but to me that is not what criminals do.
[00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:49.983]  Is the Second Amendment absolute?
[00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:53.444]  I believe so, yeah.
[00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:55.365]  I think there are good reasons to have that in place.
[00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.886]  So what would you say to the people?
[00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:00.508]  They see these shootings and they say, you know, this has got to stop.
[00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:03.349]  We see so many shootings and the children and all these things.
[00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.991]  Why would we not want more gun regulations?
[00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:16.040]  Everybody agrees these are tragedies, but even putting aside that they're blown out of proportion to a lot of extent, increasing the level of gun legislation is going to make no difference to this.
[00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:20.184]  You look at the recent shooting that just happened, what, last week or the week before?
[00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:21.806]  That was done with a pump shotgun.
[00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:26.410]  And you know, it's funny because a couple months before that, Joe Biden was standing there saying everybody should own one.
[00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:38.279]  As I told my wife, I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put that double barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.
[00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.261]  What they're trying to do really is ban firearms in general.
[00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.464]  Whatever tragedy happens to happen, they're going to use it for political purposes.
[00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:56.700]  We take this business of waking people up very seriously here at InfoWars.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.442]  That's why we have such a huge outreach operation.
[00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:03.324]  And it wouldn't be possible without the InfoWars magazine.
[00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:06.826]  And we have a very special October edition for you.
[00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:13.789]  We're gonna make it super easy for you to get interactive with your friends and family by giving you these lovely cutout masks.
[00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.430]  Not one!
[00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.232]  But two very scary educational tools for you to hit the street.
[00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.633]  Join with the collective.
[00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:27.214]  Just go to sleep and when you awaken, there'll be no more free will.
[00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:33.817]  And whatever you do, don't get a copy of October's SpecialInfoWars.com magazine.
[00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.037]  Whatever you do, don't resist.
[00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:37.598]  Give in.
[00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:47.542]  260,000 of you could be out there as Obamacare or Prozac, the killer clown.
[00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:48.982]  Hi kids!
[00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:52.863]  It's me, your favorite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor!
[00:04:53.283 --> 00:05:01.446]  Just cut along the dotted lines, cut some holes for the eyes, and attach a few rubber bands, and you are ready to wake up America this Halloween.
[00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:07.135]  Remember kids, Obamacare is for you and your family, and so is Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:14.938]  So whatever you do, don't secure your copy of InfoWars Magazine, and resist, because death is good for you.
[00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:33.486]  You can pick up your copy today at the InfoWars store.
[00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:40.109]  You can always buy these in bulk at cost, and for a limited time, the annual subscription is just $39.95.
[00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.171]  Call now, because operators are standing by.
[00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.972]  Obama, we have you!
[00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:49.854]  Because people need to know that Obamacare is bone-chillingly frightening.
