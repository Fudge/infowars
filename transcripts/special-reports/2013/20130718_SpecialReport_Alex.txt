[00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:18.330]  Last month, InfoWars reported on the possible secession of Weld County from Colorado to form its own state of North Colorado.
[00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.192]  The idea of putting this on the ballot came from intrusive new regulations being placed on rural parts of Colorado.
[00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:27.033]  Here's a clip from my interview with Commissioner Mike Freeman.
[00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.974]  You guys are looking at forming another state, North Colorado perhaps?
[00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:35.115]  It's a conversation that we've had with a number of other counties.
[00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.996]  There's a lot of issues that come into this as to the reasons why we're
[00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:48.283]  Why we're considering doing this, but we would be doing this along with other campaigns and it has nothing to do with whether we're home rule or statutory.
[00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:49.724]  What started this?
[00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:53.107]  Well, I think there's a number of things that started it.
[00:00:53.167 --> 00:01:07.659]  I think probably it's been coming even for several years, but the commissioners went to the governor and asked for if they could get a 30-day stay on the wells, on all these wells that have been shut down in the South Platte.
[00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:15.413]  To not turn them back on permanently, but turn them back on for 30 days to allow farmers to be able to save their crops.
[00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:17.975]  And they were turned down by that.
[00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:19.556]  And so that kind of started it.
[00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:25.319]  And then as we got into this legislative session, I think that it started probably with the gun laws that were passed.
[00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.461]  I think it went on from there with the, you know, the attack on oil and gas.
[00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:32.363]  And that's extremely important to what's going on in Weld County.
[00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:41.977]  And I think the thing that culminated it was Senate Bill 252, which was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, which is an alternative energy bill.
[00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:54.584]  I say 80% of the oil and gas revenue in the state of Colorado is coming out of northeastern Colorado.
[00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:59.065]  Weld, Yuma County, and some of the other counties, Commissioner Sean Conway said.
[00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:04.867]  One of the immediate issues that would have to be addressed are the water rights between the newly formed state and Colorado.
[00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:09.829]  After all the local legalities are addressed, then the Colorado General Assembly and the U.S.
[00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.970]  Congress have to approve the secession.
