[00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:10.842]  This is for the homes you foreclosed on.
[00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:12.686]  The bailouts you took.
[00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.571]  We are the true patriots.
[00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:29.074]  The long-in-development Rainbow Six Patriots has been confirmed for the next generation of gaming consoles.
[00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.935]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars news alert.
[00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:47.061]  Now, of course, the next generation of gaming consoles not only includes PlayStation 4, but also Xbox One, the same Xbox which is made by Microsoft, which has been alleged in the prison scandal, which contains advanced tracking features in their unit, but that's not the point of this report.
[00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:52.884]  Rainbow Six is a highly decorated tactical team, as the InfoWars.com article points out.
[00:00:53.624 --> 00:01:06.970]  Team Rainbow faces a new and very real threat called the True Patriots, a highly trained, well-organized revolutionary group that claim the American government is irrevocably corrupted by greedy politicians and corporate special interests.
[00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.552]  The True Patriots will do whatever it takes to reclaim their country.
[00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:19.656]  It goes on to say, players will face critical scenarios that will require them to make tough ethical decisions in order to stop this new breed of terrorist.
[00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:23.058]  We'll get to those tough ethical decisions in just one moment.
[00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:27.001]  And keep in mind, this is the statement from the game's own publisher, Ubisoft.
[00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:32.846]  Now, InfoWars has well documented in numerous reports how the mass media demonizes militia groups.
[00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:40.518]  The real programming is happening with these shows like Founding Fathers, where the guy that's pro-gun in Texas and leading the militia, he's really Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:45.923]  Which fits into the whole narrative that, oh, it's white Al-Qaeda, or gun owners are really Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:52.029]  This game doesn't stop with just patriots, it also goes after survivalists, people who can skin a buck and run a trot line.
[00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.373]  We'll do exactly what we say, or we will field dress her like a...
[00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.640]  This game is a mirror for real life.
[00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:10.448]  Not only when conservatives and patriots are targeted by the IRS, but also when the Department of Homeland Security trains to fight the, quote, free American citizens in an exercise.
[00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.951]  And don't forget about the DHS's no hesitation targets.
[00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.212]  Now back to those ethical choices.
[00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:24.896]  Shooting police is nothing new in video games, but when you play a game such as Grand Theft Auto, the action is viewed as criminal and is often optional.
[00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:32.300]  But you'll see in this trailer for Rainbow Six, not only is the act of shooting police encouraged, it is mandated to advance in the game.
[00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:49.337]  And if you think that anything in this report has been taken out of context, listen to the game's former creative director, David Sears.
[00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:52.339]  Speaking of those terrorists, who are they now this time?
[00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.000]  They're homegrown?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.561]  What does that mean exactly?
[00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:55.381]  They're homegrown.
[00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.104]  Domestic terrorism is a pretty significant threat facing the United States.
[00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:05.067]  And it's the idea that terrorists now look just like you or me.
[00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:11.071]  So it makes differentiating between friend and foe a lot more difficult, which is totally new for Rainbow.
[00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:16.715]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:17.075]  Who?
[00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:18.236]  The Founding Fathers.
[00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:19.316]  The Founding Fathers.
[00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:20.816]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:21.757]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.698]  You mean, uh, George Washington?
[00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:23.858]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:24.778]  Martin Luther King?
[00:03:24.798 --> 00:03:25.018]  Yeah.
[00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:30.320]  And we'll end with the December 2011 edition of Game Informer Magazine.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.162]  It asks the question, you fought Nazi, Russian, North Korean, and Middle Eastern threats.
[00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:40.884]  Rainbow Six Patriots ask, can you turn your weapon on your fellow countrymen?
[00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.587]  What did you do?
[00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.888]  What I had to do.
[00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:52.534]  So, targeting Americans, killing hostages, and shooting police because using a radio was too inconvenient.
[00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:55.076]  That's the new Rainbow Six Patriots.
[00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:57.718]  And many real Patriots have not taken this lying down.
[00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:03.082]  They've gone to the Ubisoft website, their Facebook page, and their Twitter page, and voiced their disgust.
[00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.944]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Alert.
[00:04:06.304 --> 00:04:08.186]  We will fuel dress her like a deer.
