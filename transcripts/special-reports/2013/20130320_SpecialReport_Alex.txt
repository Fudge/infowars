[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.581]  Hey, I'm Christy Hightower.
[00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.242]  We are back with another Ask Alex segment.
[00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:14.925]  If you have questions for this, it's at the Ask Alex group on PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:22.469]  And so before we get started though, Alex wanted me to kind of cover some of the South by Southwest crew that we had on the streets of Austin.
[00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.452]  So Alex, did you have anything you wanted me to specifically talk about?
[00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:29.675]  No, I mean, you were about to ask me these questions that I have not seen yet.
[00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:30.435]  I loved Skarnak.
[00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.597]  I liked the great Skarnak with the envelope.
[00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.440]  So I can answer some of them, obviously not some of the others.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.924]  But I wanted to talk about, because you were down there for, I guess, five, six days, you guys did it.
[00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.145]  Seven days, but yeah.
[00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:42.226]  Okay, seven days.
[00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.768]  We were only going to do like three, but they tried to kick us out of there.
[00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:46.830]  So we thought, hey, we better take our streets back.
[00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.155]  So I wanted to ask you your take on the InfoWars street team and what they did and what happened.
[00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.819]  Oh, it was awesome.
[00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:01.623]  We hit the streets with 10,000 of these bad boys and we got rid of all of them.
[00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:03.504]  I hope you can see it here.
[00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:06.167]  And we also have the contest.
[00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:09.730]  So the objective basically was to get the word out about the M4's magazine.
[00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.971]  Show them the contest page.
[00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:14.594]  And then we have the amazing Paul Revere contest.
[00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:15.754]  I've been telling all my friends about it.
[00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:16.955]  You have film abilities?
[00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:17.856]  Check this out.
[00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:17.856]  $100,000.
[00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:21.679]  So we basically hired a really great street team.
[00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.040]  It kind of varied from day to day.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.382]  We had some like 10 girls one day.
[00:01:25.422 --> 00:01:27.183]  We had like 6 girls and a couple of guys the next day.
[00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:28.784]  It was great momentum that we had going.
[00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.445]  So we got rid of...
[00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.467]  10,000 magazines.
[00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:34.268]  We got to put these in 10,000 people's hands.
[00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:37.650]  And they weren't just the people that live here in Austin.
[00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.451]  They were people from Korea.
[00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.732]  They were people from Japan.
[00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:43.653]  They were people from everywhere who were here for South America.
[00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:49.456]  Well, the reason it's important is it's also the intelligentsia of film, IT, interactive, and music.
[00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:53.999]  So you're really targeting a key group with the message of liberty.
[00:01:54.419 --> 00:02:00.002]  And that's why all the street teams that have been working on there for years had never heard of people saying you can't hand out magazines.
[00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:00.922]  It was absurd.
[00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:12.489]  And the thing is, okay, that's the issue that I wanted to talk about was that we had beautiful, we had beautiful street team, like girls, guys, everybody handing these out and they got harassed by the police who came up and didn't even know what they were doing.
[00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.150]  They didn't even have an ordinance to cite.
[00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.391]  They said, you're just not allowed to do it.
[00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:17.292]  And they literally wrote us a ticket.
[00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.214]  I'm sure that we've done a couple of pieces by now on the physical ticket.
[00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:26.658]  And the girls were just beside themselves because they didn't know what was going on or why they couldn't or couldn't do it.
[00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:31.762]  People at first, when I just shot a video, I was in Galveston on vacation with family Friday night when this happened.
[00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:33.244]  I talked to the police.
[00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:35.526]  I talked to the code enforcer on the phone when they were down there.
[00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:36.627]  You guys would hand the phone over.
[00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:36.987]  Yeah.
[00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:38.688]  And people were like, this isn't true.
[00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.030]  Why don't you show us?
[00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.311]  Well, I was in Galveston.
[00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:41.631]  Right.
[00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.332]  You know, we have free speech zones.
[00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:46.935]  We have people being arrested all over the country for filming police in public.
[00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.878]  And then we've got people still in denial.
[00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:51.900]  And that's why this tyranny is getting so bad.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.501]  When we first had a story.
[00:02:54.762 --> 00:03:01.286]  On Sunday, about how they were announcing that they were going to take 10% out of people's bank accounts in Cyprus, across the board.
[00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:07.810]  Again, InfoWars had links to the foreign press, and people were saying, you're a liar, it's not happening.
[00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:10.152]  And then of course, now that it's admitted, we're still liars.
[00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:16.876]  And it just shows that people are totally in denial, and that's what's encouraging all this tyranny.
[00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:24.900]  That's what encourages the former Press Secretary Robert Gibbs to lie and say there is no international drone program, even though it was a program on record.
[00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.501]  Absolutely.
[00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:35.127]  That's what encourages them to say there's no two billion bullets, is that it is now a sacrament or a shield of ignorance in America to value your ignorance.
[00:03:35.747 --> 00:03:39.009]  And you're not winning by living in a delusional la-la land.
[00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:48.717]  I want you out of Alice in Wonderland, the media system, the dinosaur media deception system, and to go and start researching and waking up and getting out of your trance.
[00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.498]  I mean, you talk to people.
[00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:51.359]  Are they connected?
[00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.039]  Are they awake?
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.060]  Are you able to talk to them?
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.421]  Or are they just not even real?
[00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.319]  In their own world.
[00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.080]  And that's really our problem.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.040]  In America!
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.761]  Then I had people going in and out of the South by Southwest buildings coming over and going, Get a life, Alex!
[00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.962]  You shouldn't be down here to us and stuff.
[00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:14.763]  So you're on notice while you're in your make-believe movie star crap in your local Austin Chronicle Mafia!
[00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:19.364]  I came back to Austin because you told my crew that you had Alzheimer's disease.
[00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:21.465]  I've got to wake up and go to the doctor.
[00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:23.526]  I pay taxes.
[00:04:23.606 --> 00:04:24.627]  I live here in Austin.
[00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:28.990]  I can't hand out magazines about freedom in America?
[00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.053]  And then some people are like, OK, it's bad, but what's the big deal?
[00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:35.736]  Well, then, I mean, there are no rights, then, if you're just going to say, what's the big deal?
[00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.377]  So that's why we did it.
[00:04:37.497 --> 00:04:41.641]  And the March issue is almost sold out in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100.
[00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.842]  Buy it at cost.
[00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.783]  Big, glossy, color magazine.
[00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:50.269]  And I'm just so thrilled to be getting these out to people, exposing the deep dark secrets of the New World Order.
[00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:59.038]  This is so important for you to wake up, friends and family, because now that print is going out, there's now a nostalgia forming and people are really into it.
[00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:00.680]  Just like records.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.582]  Just like records, exactly.
[00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.103]  You've got to hit the trendies with that, Alex.
[00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:05.645]  Make it cool to be in paper again.
[00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:07.707]  Yeah, well I'm predicting...
[00:05:09.068 --> 00:05:12.490]  I mean, I predicted a while ago that would happen, and it's actually happening.
[00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.013]  You can also get a subscription at InfoWarsTore.com, but enough of that.
[00:05:17.354 --> 00:05:18.834]  We are financed by your support.
[00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:21.676]  With this, it's just pure love, because we put it out at cost.
[00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.618]  But get us a yearly subscription, or get them in bulk.
[00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.861]  Now, that's my little thing up front with Ask Christy, as we call it.
[00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.082]  Truly Ask Alex.
[00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:31.342]  That's the joke around the office.
[00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:32.262]  Like, let's ask Christy.
[00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:33.923]  I'm like, I don't know everything, Alex.
[00:05:33.963 --> 00:05:35.623]  You're the one that everyone wants to talk to.
[00:05:35.883 --> 00:05:38.924]  Alex, you seem to be a bit of a space nerd sometimes.
[00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:40.264]  I like how they started.
[00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.344]  Have you looked into the Mars One mission at all?
[00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:46.525]  And I just got my hoodie and coffee mug in the mail.
[00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:51.406]  It seems as though the foundation legitimately wants to start sending immigrants to Mars by 2023.
[00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:53.846]  So I think this is a noble endeavor.
[00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.207]  And what do you think of this group?
[00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:56.287]  Have you heard of them either?
[00:05:56.747 --> 00:06:00.749]  Man, I'm going to have to start reading this stuff to show how ignorant I am.
[00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.250]  Here, I'll search it right now.
[00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.853]  The Foundation Mars.
[00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:08.634]  Let me see if I... The Mars One Mission.
[00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:10.395]  Yeah, I've been seeing this everywhere as well.
[00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:16.619]  Oh no, well I've heard about the mission where they want to send people there, but I didn't know about a group that's going to fund it.
[00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.820]  I thought it was going to be NASA.
[00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:21.606]  So, nope, can't answer that question either.
[00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:23.847]  Alright, well we'll have to come back to it.
[00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:33.593]  Alright, so this is from Tim Gunnison, and he says, I just watched the video with Melissa Melton, women arrested for attempting to block smart meter installation.
[00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.813]  And I know this was a few weeks ago.
[00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.094]  Made people really angry.
[00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:37.775]  It's still very relevant, and this is why.
[00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:44.879]  This person actually reveals, it says, and I was starting to wonder, maybe I feel so bad because the smart meters are on my apartment.
[00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.464]  Um, to tell you the truth, I have a ground floor apartment at the end of the building with all of the smart meters.
[00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:50.385]  And I don't know if you do.
[00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:50.625]  Oh my God.
[00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.989]  But I've seen this at apartment complexes too, at my apartment complex.
[00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.971]  Oh listen, we ought to go out.
[00:06:56.031 --> 00:07:01.517]  You see all these apartment buildings, or business parks, with all the antennas and cell phones right on top.
[00:07:01.857 --> 00:07:04.940]  And then when you go up to the signs up next to them, it says, don't get close to this.
[00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:05.201]  Yeah.
[00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:13.466]  In fact, I shot a video just last week on YouTube showing it over by Opal Devines, you know, down from it at the park there.
[00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.909]  There's one and it's got signs, don't get near it, but right next to it's the office park.
[00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.771]  And they know they've been linked to cancer.
[00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.453]  They know it's been linked to all these problems.
[00:07:23.953 --> 00:07:25.855]  And again, people say, well, why do you have a cell phone?
[00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:27.196]  They know it's incredibly convenient.
[00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:29.177]  I know what's going on.
[00:07:29.217 --> 00:07:30.438]  I try not to use it too much.
[00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:32.759]  But we are just bathed in this.
[00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.201]  And undoubtedly, the GMO, the additives,
[00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:37.162]  The frequency pollution.
[00:07:37.963 --> 00:07:41.246]  Just the new light bulbs they've mandated.
[00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:49.993]  I mean, you go in a place with them and you get a headache, and it gives out on average something like 40,000 times the amount of radiation that an old light bulb gave out.
[00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:54.617]  So yes, we are being bathed, and people say, well, the sun bathes you in that.
[00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:58.901]  But certain frequencies we're accustomed to, and then you get too much, it burns your nose off.
[00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:02.630]  I mean, you know, that's an example of what all this stuff is doing to us.
[00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.371]  Well, that was some of the symptoms.
[00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.491]  Those were some of the symptoms that this person lists.
[00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:10.833]  It says, I've gone to the doctor with rashes, with lumps, that they seem to come and go.
[00:08:10.853 --> 00:08:15.654]  I feel like my heart is in my throat, but the doctors always check me out as fine.
[00:08:15.754 --> 00:08:17.775]  Sounds like it's time to move.
[00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:19.216]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:29.402]  Well, it's mainly a lot of mothers around the country, including middle class, people in high-end neighborhoods, notice that as soon as they go in, suddenly their family starts getting sick.
[00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:29.683]  Yeah.
[00:08:30.123 --> 00:08:31.304]  And listen, it's not just that.
[00:08:31.364 --> 00:08:34.186]  The smart meters dial in and break in
[00:08:35.026 --> 00:08:40.648]  To all of the different appliances in your house that are all designed to be hijacked by them.
[00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:42.409]  And they brag about this.
[00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.691]  So it's a robot attached to the side of your house, an imperial probe droid.
[00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:49.332]  And you know what Chewbacca did to that?
[00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:53.033]  We need to copyright some of your phrases.
[00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:56.515]  No, but I am a space nerd.
[00:08:56.555 --> 00:08:59.276]  I mean, the planet's tiny compared to all this stuff around us.
[00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.716]  And I find it really, really interesting.
[00:09:01.217 --> 00:09:04.458]  And I'm ashamed I don't know what the Mission to Mars Foundation is.
[00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:06.196]  Well, uh... Here, you find it.
[00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:06.957]  What is it?
[00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:07.517]  I don't know.
[00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:09.238]  Now it's gonna... I can't find anything.
[00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.459]  Well, I say I don't look at these.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.082]  Maybe I should look at these so I can sound really smart.
[00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:15.724]  Truthfully, that's not a gimmick that I don't read these first.
[00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:17.165]  I'm too busy to read them first.
[00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:17.705]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:18.105]  I did it.
[00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:20.647]  First go around, I tried to make him read them, but...
[00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:29.910]  Yeah, we went to Big Ben, there was no frequency pollution, nothing, cell phones didn't work, we felt great!
[00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.192]  It's true, it's true.
[00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:33.232]  No, thank you!
[00:09:33.252 --> 00:09:34.293]  No, no, we'll leave that in the piece.
[00:09:34.313 --> 00:09:35.153]  That was Rob Dew behind the camera.
[00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:36.254]  Rob Dew, come on over here with me.
[00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:36.735]  Thank you.
[00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.036]  There he is, Rob Dew.
[00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:40.737]  You know Marcos Morales, his nickname for him?
[00:09:40.777 --> 00:09:41.157]  Hi!
[00:09:41.478 --> 00:09:43.219]  Here, come on, go ahead and tell people about it.
[00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:52.605]  Well, when the first crew started and we started doing the nightly news, you know, I had to tell people several times to do things, and after a while I kind of donned
[00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:56.518]  Captains here, Monica, started yelling at people.
[00:09:56.878 --> 00:09:57.739]  Not bad.
[00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:03.423]  You're now accusing me of teaching you that?
[00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:03.983]  I think.
[00:10:04.524 --> 00:10:06.785]  Kirsten, you ever heard me yell?
[00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:07.706]  Be honest.
[00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:09.367]  Am I supposed to lie?
[00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:10.788]  What, one time?
[00:10:10.808 --> 00:10:11.449]  Once or twice.
[00:10:11.469 --> 00:10:12.830]  I've seen you break a phone before.
[00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.770]  That was interesting.
[00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.993]  Now wait a minute, when did I break a phone?
[00:10:17.093 --> 00:10:20.135]  It was one of those wireless ones and you just cracked it right in half.
[00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:21.216]  Oh, I remember that.
[00:10:21.256 --> 00:10:25.139]  We'll leave that in because it makes me sound powerful.
[00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:36.128]  I mean, a lot of it is frustration and technology not working or certain things don't work right or people aren't doing what they're supposed to do and then it all wells up by the end of the day and you're under the gun.
[00:10:36.228 --> 00:10:36.508]  Yeah.
[00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:39.350]  And anyway, they started, Marco started calling me Ducifer.
[00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.852]  And so that is stuck.
[00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:45.495]  I got a nameplate with it and now Jones says that to me on the air sometimes.
[00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:46.275]  It's true.
[00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.276]  We got Ducifer here.
[00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:48.497]  Say something.
[00:10:48.537 --> 00:10:49.678]  We better stop that though.
[00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:56.522]  We have revealed Ducifer today and we are going to retire him, exorcise him today.
[00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.923]  It's more like a tell-all.
[00:10:59.244 --> 00:11:01.226]  I'm breaking phones, your name's Ducifer?
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.860]  People love this.
[00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:03.541]  I know I do.
[00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:04.962]  I watch them and I laugh.
[00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:10.304]  Alright, so Alex, you mentioned doping the kids up on... What is it that Milchristie makes me act goofy?
[00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:17.128]  We're here, I mean, everything is very, very serious all day long and it just feels good to laugh sometimes.
[00:11:17.368 --> 00:11:18.468]  And run around crazy.
[00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:21.130]  Yeah, and you know, throw boots in the air.
[00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.571]  Yeah, make Harlem Shake videos.
[00:11:25.392 --> 00:11:25.852]  Was that fun?
[00:11:27.535 --> 00:11:29.156]  That was well done, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:31.718]  And I don't think anybody realized that it said, with the terrorists.
[00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.319]  Like, I don't think anybody realized that.
[00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:37.041]  And I don't think people got that, that that's us running around doing that.
[00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:38.242]  I'm the guy with the skull mask.
[00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:42.685]  So we're gonna replay just the Harlem Shake part right now for you.
[00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:43.806]  Here it is.
[00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:24.493]  And by the way, if you watch there where the guy in the steel skull mask goes rolling, I trip over dude who's like the giant cigarette box or whatever it was.
[00:12:25.434 --> 00:12:26.575]  Yeah, the Obama head.
[00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:28.436]  He went and got a box out of the back and did that.
[00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.777]  And that's real where I roll.
[00:12:30.597 --> 00:12:30.978]  Anyways.
[00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:33.313]  All right, continuing, next question.
[00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:37.175]  All of the techno Alex role.
[00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.096]  Yeah, cut that out.
[00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:38.516]  No, I'm kidding.
[00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:49.443]  All right, so Alex, you mentioned doping the kids all the time on Ritalin, and obviously Ritalin isn't the drug that's readily used anymore, but what are some of the harmful side effects slash long term?
[00:12:49.463 --> 00:13:01.470]  And you talk about this all the time, but I think it's really valuable to bring back up because he suggests, he's like, perhaps the more underlying question, do you think ADD and ADHD are real or fictional diseases?
[00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:11.316]  No, they just take problems in society and general things like young boys not minding running around hyperactive, beating each other up, and then they list that as abnormal.
[00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:25.104]  Whereas you take any mammal species, especially like male dogs, puppies, they're biting each other, they're biting you, they're running around chewing the carpet, and now actually they put them on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:26.925]  They put dogs on antidepressants.
[00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.227]  If your six-month-old puppy is teething,
[00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:31.628]  And wanting to go outside and craps on the floor?
[00:13:31.648 --> 00:13:32.468]  Well, just drug your dog.
[00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:35.350]  Because everybody knows dogs have always, you know, done that.
[00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.170]  Had to have drugs.
[00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.751]  So, going back like 10 years ago, I'd say, you know what?
[00:13:39.172 --> 00:13:40.232]  Puppies act like this.
[00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:41.132]  We don't drug them.
[00:13:41.393 --> 00:13:42.473]  Right.
[00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:43.594]  But now they actually do it.
[00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:45.274]  So, I shouldn't give them ideas.
[00:13:45.995 --> 00:13:49.757]  But if I was to give my puppy, let's say a Coca-Cola,
[00:13:50.777 --> 00:13:52.118]  It would act like a demonic demon.
[00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:52.979]  Absolutely.
[00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:55.961]  And so children are on all these dyes, these additives.
[00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:59.924]  It's a wonder that they're even operating at any functional level.
[00:14:00.364 --> 00:14:01.585]  And then they go to school.
[00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:04.968]  I remember when I was a kid, the vending machines were Twinkies and Coca-Cola.
[00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:07.770]  And I remember, like an hour after I did it, I'd feel horrible.
[00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.490]  I want another one.
[00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.811]  Well, it's designed to do that.
[00:14:10.192 --> 00:14:11.472]  And so we don't get them off Twinkies.
[00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:12.493]  We don't get them off Coca-Cola.
[00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:14.555]  We don't get them off GMO, aspartame.
[00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:15.556]  We don't get them off fluoride.
[00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:16.796]  We just say, oh,
[00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:19.038]  This 10-year-old seems depressed.
[00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:20.319]  He's got zits all over his face.
[00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.540]  Looks like a concentration camp victim.
[00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:24.221]  It's not his nutrition.
[00:14:25.102 --> 00:14:27.784]  Or it's not he's watching TV 7-8 hours a day and video games.
[00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:29.585]  It's not that the parents are working till late at night.
[00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:31.086]  It's not that the family's been broken up.
[00:14:31.486 --> 00:14:38.010]  It's that you need a drug made by a big drug company, who by the way knew that people died and committed suicide in the trials.
[00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:41.473]  Then when there's suicides and deaths, the answer is put more kids on drugs.
[00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:42.854]  Then there's more suicide deaths.
[00:14:43.034 --> 00:14:44.555]  Then the answer is more suicide deaths.
[00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:45.123]  Yeah.
[00:14:45.143 --> 00:14:46.183]  And it answers more drugs.
[00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:48.084]  And it says on the insert, makes you do this.
[00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:48.544]  Right.
[00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:52.505]  But in the land of mindlessness, that's a crime to admit that.
[00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.606]  Yeah, well said.
[00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:55.326]  Absolutely.
[00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:58.207]  Alright, so the next question.
[00:14:58.447 --> 00:15:11.071]  Can we know for sure that the backlog of gun orders is caused by the people getting them for themselves and not by the government-induced gun shortage, like the mass DHS ammo purchases?
[00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:14.652]  How do we know that it's not civilians buying up guns and not
[00:15:14.972 --> 00:15:20.315]  Well, number one, people always call us civilians, and the government, the government, the government's civilians, they're citizens.
[00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:24.458]  Which is why that distinction... It's like, exactly, it's like, you're a civilian now.
[00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:29.061]  Mayors call people civilians, you know, I'm an official, you're a civilian.
[00:15:29.081 --> 00:15:29.962]  There's like ten people right now.
[00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:31.783]  You're a citizen, that means you pay me money.
[00:15:33.944 --> 00:15:35.865]  But no, I mean, it's a cocktail of things.
[00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:37.647]  People are always, is it this or is it that?
[00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:38.067]  Yeah.
[00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:41.388]  What do you think of this psychological field or that psychological field?
[00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:42.488]  Well, there's something in all of them.
[00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:53.491]  I'm into unifying field theory because there's a lot of good information basically in anything out there, but you've got to take from it what has worked for you in the world, what you've found to be true.
[00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:57.192]  It's all about scientists saying they discovered something.
[00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:06.202]  You'll always see these British explorers saying, I discovered this Incan temple up on top of this Peruvian plateau.
[00:16:06.222 --> 00:16:12.029]  And then you go up there and there's villagers living in the ruins and they're the ones that told them, there's ruins on top of mountain.
[00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.293]  And then you'll find out some Spanish explorer really found it for Westerners 500 years before, but they'll just spin it like that.
[00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:30.659]  So everyone has their own little fields of science saying this is the way it is, like it's religions fighting with each other, instead of just more discovery and science and ideas and renaissance growing.
[00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:36.216]  When they ask the question, how do we know it's not the citizens buying ammo that's causing the shortage?
[00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:48.207]  Citizens buying ammo is part of the shortage, but government placing orders for two billion rounds, a billion of which have been delivered, and then a billion rounds out in the next year and more orders, that's causing the run on it.
[00:16:49.187 --> 00:16:51.488]  And so when you do have the run on something, then hoarding starts.
[00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:51.969]  Yeah.
[00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:53.850]  But it's also good business.
[00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:03.496]  You know, if you go out and buy a bunch of ammo, like a lot of people knew would happen, knowing Obama would come after it a few years ago, those people are now at the gun show saying, yeah, I'm the only one that has it left.
[00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:04.837]  I'm a free market guy.
[00:17:04.937 --> 00:17:07.999]  I waited till, you know, they tried to restrict all this.
[00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.120]  And now the .50 Cal I bought for $5,000, selling for $20,000.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.201]  Wow.
[00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:12.802]  Or now the box of .223 I bought for $5 is now $30.
[00:17:14.963 --> 00:17:18.125]  Do you think it's worth it for those guys to sell it right now?
[00:17:18.165 --> 00:17:23.168]  Because if the value of the dollar is going to go down, what's the point of getting 15 grand for your gun that you bought at 5,000 now?
[00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:26.872]  Well, it's all a balance and it's all what you do.
[00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:28.793]  It's all objective.
[00:17:29.093 --> 00:17:29.974]  Okay.
[00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:32.735]  I mean, they can now digitally just take all your money out of your bank account.
[00:17:32.755 --> 00:17:33.716]  They're saying they may do it.
[00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:34.997]  People say, well, then what do you do?
[00:17:35.037 --> 00:17:35.537]  Gold and silver.
[00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:36.457]  Well, they could confiscate that.
[00:17:36.797 --> 00:17:39.899]  That's many layers more hard to actually get it from.
[00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:40.399]  Yeah.
[00:17:40.639 --> 00:17:43.181]  So it's all just, people say, well, they could still get that.
[00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:45.202]  Well, then just roll over in a ditch then, you know?
[00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:46.242]  Yeah.
[00:17:46.503 --> 00:17:47.563]  People say it's a terrible world.
[00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:48.284]  Why are you having kids?
[00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:48.884]  Well, I haven't given up.
[00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:51.565]  Yeah, well that's good.
[00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.346]  Next question.
[00:17:54.386 --> 00:18:07.871]  What correlations do you believe there to be with recent revolutions and past revolutions, such as the French Revolution and the subsequent terror, and do you believe it is the fate of all revolutions to be hijacked by moneyed interests?
[00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:10.972]  And this is a George Orwell quote, this is the end of the question.
[00:18:11.272 --> 00:18:15.796]  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution.
[00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:19.639]  One makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:33.771]  Yes, generally revolutions are one group of wannabe aristocrats, one group of oligarchs, wannabe oligarchs, who generally come from the governing class, who want to make themselves king.
[00:18:34.432 --> 00:18:37.514]  And that's why I'm against physical revolutions.
[00:18:39.796 --> 00:18:42.317]  Or collectivist revolutions, because they always lead to a nightmare.
[00:18:42.498 --> 00:18:53.383]  I want a revolution of ideas to restore the ideas of the Enlightenment, to restore the ideas of the Renaissance, to restore the ideas of true human individuality and empowerment.
[00:18:53.724 --> 00:19:03.529]  And through that move towards individualism, you will set up automatic bulwarks which will frustrate and stop any collectivist model, whether it be fascism, socialism, any of it.
[00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:09.750]  So like a cultural movement, just like with the GMOs, the Prop 37, that was a huge spike in people's interest.
[00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.451]  Yeah, it's a velvet revolution.
[00:19:11.811 --> 00:19:20.173]  And the establishment tries to push their own and always act like their tyranny is the cutting, trendy edge of something new, but it's all just more collectivism, more centralization.
[00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:21.993]  Because the big guys don't want competition.
[00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:22.733]  No, of course not.
[00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:25.154]  I mean, I don't have an instinct to try to crush smaller people.
[00:19:26.494 --> 00:19:28.175]  But a lot of other talk show hosts do.
[00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:40.098]  There's also people who want to be the revolutionaries to have power who will actually attack me and say that I've tried to squash them with no evidence because they're playing the part of a revolutionary and casting me as the government.
[00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:45.499]  So, again, there's all the seeds of the next dictatorship within each new revolution.
[00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:51.201]  And so I want a restoration to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, which was never fully realized.
[00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:56.044]  It became the greatest expression of human liberty because a shadow of it was realized.
[00:19:56.104 --> 00:19:56.344]  Yeah.
[00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:57.125]  Yeah.
[00:19:57.445 --> 00:20:00.947]  Well, I mean, every day I work here, I appreciate the Constitution more and more.
[00:20:01.147 --> 00:20:01.588]  It's true.
[00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:03.829]  I read that little booklet that we send out with orders.
[00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.353]  Well, I mean, we've got to go say, hey, Constitution, back off.
[00:20:08.393 --> 00:20:10.674]  And it still has some power, like a cross to a vampire.
[00:20:10.935 --> 00:20:12.716]  They still go, we'll be back next time.
[00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:13.536]  Yeah.
[00:20:13.576 --> 00:20:15.578]  And as soon as I left, they're back again.
[00:20:15.598 --> 00:20:16.679]  Shall not be infringed.
[00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:19.221]  But I mean, they know to just keep coming until you give up.
[00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:19.541]  Yeah.
[00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.822]  They know to just keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
[00:20:22.062 --> 00:20:24.223]  Well, we've got to learn to keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
[00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:24.503]  Yeah.
[00:20:24.963 --> 00:20:25.243]  Yeah.
[00:20:25.263 --> 00:20:26.043]  Well, that's tiring.
[00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:27.364]  It's a lot more tiring than being a slave.
[00:20:27.584 --> 00:20:27.744]  Yeah.
[00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:28.484]  Well, that's true.
[00:20:28.704 --> 00:20:29.125]  Absolutely.
[00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:29.905]  Product placement.
[00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:31.085]  I haven't plugged these yet on air.
[00:20:31.506 --> 00:20:33.686]  The new InfoWars mugs are in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:34.707]  Oh, they're so cool.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.061]  They hold 15 ounces, too.
[00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:37.921]  They're bigger than normal.
[00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:38.782]  This is my favorite design.
[00:20:38.802 --> 00:20:39.462]  That's why I picked it.
[00:20:39.683 --> 00:20:40.383]  It's awesome.
[00:20:40.483 --> 00:20:41.143]  This type of cup.
[00:20:41.183 --> 00:20:46.327]  But what's even better is that you get a good coffee cup and you fund our operation.
[00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:46.987]  That's why they're cool.
[00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:48.528]  Absolutely.
[00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:52.370]  That last question, I wanted to give a shout out to Codex317.
[00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.591]  That's a really good question.
[00:20:55.752 --> 00:21:00.716]  Alright, so this next one is, after the Tribulation, the movie, what an eye-opener.
[00:21:01.056 --> 00:21:09.763]  I've never believed in the pre-Tribulation rapture, but the enormity and intensity of the Tribulation didn't hit me until I saw this movie.
[00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:12.646]  After I saw it, a question kept coming to me.
[00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:14.107]  Here's my question, Alex.
[00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:20.272]  Considering that surveillance techniques and weapons of the one-world government... Apologize, flipping the page.
[00:21:20.532 --> 00:21:21.052]  How dare you?
[00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:21.472]  I know.
[00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:27.854]  Are so advanced, is there any hope that any of us could survive the tribulation through survival techniques?
[00:21:28.074 --> 00:21:31.534]  Aren't we just postponing buying some time by prepping?
[00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:35.535]  That's an incredibly complex question.
[00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:36.775]  It's also a very good question.
[00:21:37.616 --> 00:21:38.736]  That was Catherine, by the way.
[00:21:40.296 --> 00:21:48.658]  The New World Order is going to be rolled out in actuaried, computerized, pre-set, pre-designed requisites, where it rolls out
[00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:57.941]  Incrementally against the population and against the weakest population and we'll always have cover stories for why it's doing it for groups that are above that.
[00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:02.863]  But then in the end game, it's actually moving up towards people with more and more money.
[00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:13.124]  Most tyrannies first start with weak groups to sell the upper classes that it's okay, because they know upper classes like to be on a power trip and feel like they're not going to be affected.
[00:22:13.704 --> 00:22:17.406]  But this one is moving against the poorest, but also moving against the middle class.
[00:22:17.946 --> 00:22:19.747]  So it's vectoring out.
[00:22:20.628 --> 00:22:28.912]  And just by becoming self-sufficient, just by doing little things like a garden or buying organic or talking to your neighbors,
[00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:32.214]  It's not just one track.
[00:22:32.874 --> 00:22:34.155]  There's not just evil in the world.
[00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:35.196]  The good is in the world.
[00:22:36.016 --> 00:22:40.039]  But we just kind of look at this big giant system and marvel at it and think, I could never defeat it.
[00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:41.960]  But it's made up of billions of little parts.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:52.966]  When you start doing things with your will and taking action and voting with your dollars and supporting alternative real media, you build new systems and new ecosystems.
[00:22:53.086 --> 00:22:54.167]  Weren't you talking about that earlier?
[00:22:54.187 --> 00:23:00.012]  You were saying that the only way to establish, like, something new is to just do it yourself, like, outside of the system?
[00:23:00.072 --> 00:23:01.854]  Absolutely, and the universe turns towards it.
[00:23:01.894 --> 00:23:02.454]  It's magic.
[00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:11.002]  I don't mean magic like a bubble bubble toil and trouble, you know, pinch of this and pinch of that, eye of newt and tail of weasel.
[00:23:11.402 --> 00:23:12.664]  I mean, I'm not talking about that.
[00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:17.408]  I mean, just going out and doing things, going out and creating things, threatens the system.
[00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:17.848]  Yeah.
[00:23:17.888 --> 00:23:22.229]  Early on the establishment, I didn't know one tenth of what I know now, came after me.
[00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:24.830]  The local kind of mafia media establishment in Austin.
[00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.190]  They were scared.
[00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:38.194]  And the very same people that Lewis Black, that runs the Chronicle, that runs South by Southwest, you know, was just trying to hammer me and shut me down and writing incredible lies, cover stories, just whole cloth, none of it true.
[00:23:38.214 --> 00:23:38.954]  Yeah.
[00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:42.295]  But people would believe it because how could this whole thing be made up?
[00:23:42.615 --> 00:23:44.336]  You know, just like works of fiction.
[00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:44.676]  Do what?
[00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:45.636]  Did you sue him?
[00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:50.259]  Number one, I've always had the instinct that stuff like that will come back on people.
[00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:54.785]  And plus, I know enough about lawsuits, because I have sued people who like to threaten my sister and stuff.
[00:23:54.805 --> 00:23:56.327]  Because then you got to.
[00:23:56.627 --> 00:23:57.869]  And I ended up winning those things.
[00:23:59.178 --> 00:24:05.063]  You know, it's, it's, I mean, Rob do, you know, won a lawsuit for being, you know, falsely arrested in Pittsburgh.
[00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:06.524]  But, you know, sometimes you have to do it.
[00:24:06.584 --> 00:24:06.844]  Yeah.
[00:24:07.024 --> 00:24:10.687]  But I don't even have people out there watching in the wider world even know who I'm talking about.
[00:24:11.247 --> 00:24:15.431]  It's just that whatever you've got on top, there's smaller models of it up close.
[00:24:15.931 --> 00:24:20.294]  And they're not, they're trying to shut down little guys because they think you're pathetic and weak.
[00:24:20.735 --> 00:24:25.238]  They're trying to shut you down if they see real talent because, you know, this is their game.
[00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:25.839]  Yeah.
[00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:27.100]  No, these streets belong to them.
[00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:30.457]  Uh oh, it's like a turf war.
[00:24:30.577 --> 00:24:34.198]  What we think of, we've been taught that the mafia is only Italians.
[00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:39.560]  By the archetypal thing of New Jersey, New York going, buddy, you don't hand that out on the streets here.
[00:24:40.301 --> 00:24:41.841]  But I mean, they try that everywhere.
[00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:46.703]  It didn't work too well in many areas that were more frontier, just because people weren't going to bow to anybody.
[00:24:46.863 --> 00:24:47.843]  Yeah.
[00:24:48.003 --> 00:24:48.864]  They had self-respect.
[00:24:48.964 --> 00:24:55.925]  I feel like a lot of people, on the streets of Austin, it was really fascinating because we had, for South Byte and the crew, there was every kind of person you could imagine.
[00:24:55.986 --> 00:24:59.366]  And the thing is, like, they didn't know how to approach the magazine, a lot of them.
[00:24:59.647 --> 00:25:02.347]  They saw the gun and they saw the American flag and it scared them.
[00:25:02.607 --> 00:25:06.088]  It was like, they didn't, they were like, oh my god, I'm in America, I don't know what that means.
[00:25:06.688 --> 00:25:08.449]  So, just a side note, but that was...
[00:25:08.829 --> 00:25:09.770]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.391]  That's why it is a provocative cover.
[00:25:11.672 --> 00:25:11.932]  Yeah.
[00:25:12.112 --> 00:25:14.074]  A gun and the flag.
[00:25:14.354 --> 00:25:15.936]  I had a lot of people that were surprising.
[00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:22.642]  You know, they dressed like the typical hipster with the tight skinny jeans and wearing the PBR, you know, whatever the thing is.
[00:25:23.202 --> 00:25:23.603]  Beards.
[00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:26.125]  Yeah, the beard is huge, especially here in Austin.
[00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:31.909]  They would jump out of the group of their friends as I was trying to hand them out on the streets, like, to get this magazine.
[00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:38.454]  So it was also surprising to see the kind of people that I wouldn't assume would want this, but they, like, leapt at me for it.
[00:25:38.534 --> 00:25:42.397]  So I feel, you've said this before, but people are really hungry for the truth.
[00:25:42.657 --> 00:25:49.502]  And, you know, like you said before, we're not always 100%, but the thing is, like, our goal is to tell the truth.
[00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:52.084]  And so I think a lot of mainstream media forgets that.
[00:25:52.444 --> 00:25:53.846]  Well said, Lord Vader.
[00:25:54.466 --> 00:25:59.571]  Going back to your one man doing something, the two guys you had in today doing the printable gun thing.
[00:25:59.652 --> 00:25:59.932]  Yeah.
[00:25:59.952 --> 00:26:01.553]  Putting fear into people's hearts.
[00:26:01.774 --> 00:26:03.395]  Exactly, the printable gun revolution.
[00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:04.677]  Three guys.
[00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:15.266]  And it shows, or Bitcoin or any of this, and it doesn't mean the system might not try to block those guys, or might not try to block Bitcoin.
[00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:24.672]  But still, the idea gets out there, and it shows how more people doing things like that, if the globalists crush them, it'll make them martyrs.
[00:26:26.173 --> 00:26:29.415]  So they've quietly tried to block them, but that only blew up in their face too.
[00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:33.236]  People out there resonate with justice, folks.
[00:26:33.256 --> 00:26:40.080]  That's why you've got to get in the arena, and then the system will try to keep you down, but that's only pure proof of how much power you've got.
[00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:42.842]  I mean, you've got to engage the enemy.
[00:26:42.882 --> 00:26:44.063]  You've got to get in the arena.
[00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:45.665]  Absolutely.
[00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:46.926]  I like it.
[00:26:47.427 --> 00:26:49.468]  I like the energy that we get from these Ask Alex.
[00:26:49.488 --> 00:26:50.389]  They make me very happy.
[00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:58.916]  Alright, so Alex, I was wondering if you've ever heard of or had any feedback on Dr. Wilhelm Reich.
[00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:00.737]  He was a scientist from the 1930s.
[00:27:00.797 --> 00:27:01.057]  Reich.
[00:27:01.498 --> 00:27:01.978]  Is it Reich?
[00:27:02.018 --> 00:27:03.039]  I apologize for saying it wrong.
[00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:03.820]  No, no, no.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.921]  He was a scientist from the 30s.
[00:27:04.941 --> 00:27:07.483]  It's potato patata, but they all say William Reich.
[00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:07.863]  Cool.
[00:27:08.483 --> 00:27:21.166]  He discovered and managed to measure a previously undiscovered form of energy which he named Orgon energy and the United States government ruined his reputation just like we were talking about right now and tried to disprove his findings.
[00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:26.327]  Yeah, let me be clear.
[00:27:26.347 --> 00:27:32.708]  He... They've discovered the dark matter and they've discovered that there's a hard wiring holding everything in together.
[00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:35.929]  And they've discovered the God particle and the rest of it.
[00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:41.571]  He obviously was able to pick up on some of what Tesla called the ether.
[00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:48.463]  But then he also kind of got far afield, as I've heard some of the recordings, as he got older.
[00:27:48.823 --> 00:27:54.584]  And then a lot of quacks have come and picked up what he did and discredited a lot of what he's done.
[00:27:55.064 --> 00:27:55.804]  So it's both.
[00:27:56.184 --> 00:27:58.185]  By not being able to recreate his experiments?
[00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:07.506]  Or by just saying they're selling, you know, organ generators or they've developed things that will cure cancer or, you know, this system will do that.
[00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:09.167]  I mean, there's something to what he discovered.
[00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.087]  And he was very, you know, visionary.
[00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:15.709]  And the ancients and the occultists, you know, are into shapes and energies and things.
[00:28:15.729 --> 00:28:16.749]  There's definitely something to it.
[00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:17.149]  Right.
[00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:18.770]  It's just that it's hard to quantify.
[00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.330]  It's like they've proven there's a sixth sense.
[00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.812]  They've proven that there is clairvoyance, but it's not very controllable.
[00:28:25.152 --> 00:28:27.973]  So you've got quacks then that claim they're totally psychic.
[00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:28.473]  Right.
[00:28:28.553 --> 00:28:32.775]  But then I personally have had dreams that I call waking dreams that actually come true.
[00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:33.855]  And you know when you're having one.
[00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:35.316]  It freaks you out because
[00:28:36.544 --> 00:28:37.624]  Happened a lot more when I was young.
[00:28:37.644 --> 00:28:41.345]  That's why I think young people, you know, are more psychic or whatever, before the world gets to them and all the things.
[00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:43.746]  So I know there's a lot of stuff out there.
[00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:45.006]  And that's all spiritual people are.
[00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:48.287]  We're saying we know there's stuff out there that hasn't been understood or discovered.
[00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.747]  And the atheists are like, no, it's only this.
[00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:54.248]  And they always seem, the ones I know, to buy into whatever the official line is.
[00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:57.109]  It's like questioning means, you know, you're a kook.
[00:28:58.769 --> 00:29:02.630]  And, but again, but it's also kind of both, because I've looked into him.
[00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:04.612]  Okay, well that's really interesting.
[00:29:04.672 --> 00:29:07.454]  Yeah, I haven't looked into alternative energy.
[00:29:07.594 --> 00:29:09.015]  Rife generators, all of it, yeah.
[00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:10.456]  It seems really interesting.
[00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:11.037]  It's a minefield.
[00:29:11.497 --> 00:29:12.018]  I can imagine.
[00:29:12.538 --> 00:29:13.238]  I like life.
[00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:15.160]  Alright, so this is the last question.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.244]  Alex, I'm 62 years old and I've been on antidepressant medication since I was in my early teens.
[00:29:21.825 --> 00:29:25.007]  I had no criminal record and I've never thought of hurting another person.
[00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:29.671]  I've tried on many occasions to stop this medication, but it never works.
[00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:32.092]  I end up on major depressive episodes, etc.
[00:29:32.953 --> 00:29:39.680]  And I just wanted to say that I hope that you consider the fact that not all people on antidepressant medicines are prone to mass shootings.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.284]  And obviously, I'll finish this question, but even violence towards other humans.
[00:29:44.445 --> 00:29:47.828]  I own guns but have never used them for any purpose other than hunting.
[00:29:47.888 --> 00:29:50.531]  I could never live with myself if I was to kill an innocent person.
[00:29:51.412 --> 00:29:53.514]  What are your thoughts on this?
[00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:58.764]  Well, not everybody that takes LSD goes and jumps off a 20-story balcony.
[00:29:58.985 --> 00:29:59.265]  Right.
[00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:07.091]  I'm sure there are some people, however they're chemically wired, that, you know, one man's poisons another person's...
[00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:08.683]  It's true.
[00:30:08.743 --> 00:30:10.184]  I drink red wine and I get calf cramps.
[00:30:10.204 --> 00:30:13.026]  I have to take a ton of magnesium to supplement for that.
[00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:18.230]  So that's my, that's my... Yeah, so, so, you know, one person's trash, another man's treasure.
[00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:22.253]  So I don't, I mean, they're kind of oversimplifying their question.
[00:30:22.293 --> 00:30:23.213]  I'm not criticizing them.
[00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:35.382]  I'm saying that if you look at it, almost every mass shooter has been on antipsychotics or psychotropics and the inserts admit that in a certain statistical part, it takes the inhibition away.
[00:30:35.782 --> 00:30:36.783]  As soon as I heard that a guy...
[00:30:37.523 --> 00:30:40.685]  I killed a cop a few months ago in Austin, just in cold blood, for no reason, in a Walmart.
[00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:42.345]  I said, he'll be on antidepressants, and he was.
[00:30:43.026 --> 00:30:44.366]  He mixed alcohol with them.
[00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:48.749]  And the guy was like a zombie, walking around with a gun, and the cop walks up and he just shoots him.
[00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:51.370]  And they described him as zombie-like.
[00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.291]  Well, he's on drugs.
[00:30:52.831 --> 00:30:54.332]  And it's prescription drugs that do that.
[00:30:55.152 --> 00:30:59.394]  And, you know, if you've been wired up on these drugs a long time, your brain gets where they're addicted to them.
[00:31:00.134 --> 00:31:02.896]  And I would guess that person's probably been put on more and more over the years.
[00:31:03.336 --> 00:31:04.537]  Because it stops working.
[00:31:05.427 --> 00:31:09.111]  I mean, I've known people that are on a bunch of psychotropics and they're happy as can be.
[00:31:10.192 --> 00:31:11.854]  But again, when are they going to have that bad trip?
[00:31:12.194 --> 00:31:12.415]  Yeah.
[00:31:12.655 --> 00:31:16.699]  Okay, acid for most people doesn't hurt them, but the wrong person takes it, you know, they kill their whole family.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.160]  Yeah.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.884]  So all I'm saying is these are very dangerous drugs in the hallucinogen class in the psychotropic family.
[00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.151]  They're in the general hallucinogen class, psychotropic family.
[00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:27.233]  And they are hallucinogenic.
[00:31:27.873 --> 00:31:30.515]  And they put you in kind of a trance, daydream area.
[00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:34.036]  And sure, you're probably a really nice person, so that's fine, you're not a danger.
[00:31:34.577 --> 00:31:37.278]  They're going to try to say you can't own guns soon because you're on these drugs.
[00:31:37.798 --> 00:31:40.280]  Because statistically that's... I don't think you should lose your right.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.060]  Because they'll just use it to take my right.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.922]  I'm not on them, but I say let the felons all have guns.
[00:31:45.444 --> 00:31:46.165]  Yeah.
[00:31:46.306 --> 00:31:50.272]  Because they're now making felons about a guy that releases balloons to his girlfriend.
[00:31:50.753 --> 00:31:52.115]  The guy's gonna go to jail for felonies.
[00:31:52.135 --> 00:31:53.237]  Environmental endangerment.
[00:31:55.504 --> 00:31:59.647]  Again, my issue is, is that psychotropics have been connected to this.
[00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:00.748]  They're forcing them on people.
[00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:02.309]  And I'm not saying go off of them for you.
[00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:08.914]  I'm saying they have regimens, doctors have regimens to go off them over several months, very slowly.
[00:32:09.195 --> 00:32:11.096]  Get extra sun, get extra exercise.
[00:32:11.717 --> 00:32:13.578]  There's a lot of supplements in major studies.
[00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:15.199]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:16.080]  I'm talking about what I've read.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.400]  St.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.081]  John's wort, so many other things that have.
[00:32:19.162 --> 00:32:21.804]  And double blind studies are better effect than the Prozac type drugs.
[00:32:22.305 --> 00:32:24.286]  So there's also natural things you can do.
[00:32:25.407 --> 00:32:30.591]  And of course they say don't really mess, a lot of doctors I talk to say well they're trying to mess with serotonin.
[00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:33.293]  Why not deal with all these other things that are in your body?
[00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:34.875]  I mean there's other alternatives out there.
[00:32:34.895 --> 00:32:35.935]  Well and most of it's in your gut.
[00:32:36.135 --> 00:32:39.458]  Like 80% or 70% of your serotonin is actually in your gut.
[00:32:39.538 --> 00:32:42.220]  So I mean everyone's been misinformed thinking it's only in your brain.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:48.105]  But actually what that means is you need to eat healthy because if your gut isn't absorbing the right nutrients you're going to feel like crap.
[00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:51.446]  Exactly, when the gut's connected to all those nerves that go right to the brain.
[00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:51.986]  Exactly.
[00:32:52.006 --> 00:32:55.447]  Right through the spinal cord nerve endings.
[00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:56.187]  It's just amazing.
[00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:59.188]  Well, that's a great question and that was a great Ask Christy.
[00:32:59.588 --> 00:33:01.809]  Well, thank you guys again for all the questions.
[00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:05.110]  Keep them coming in the Ask Alex group on PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.091]  We'll try to get these out a little more.
[00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:10.792]  I'll bug Alex a little more here to get them out to you a little more often.
