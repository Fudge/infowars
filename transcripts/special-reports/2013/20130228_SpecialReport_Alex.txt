[00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:12.278]  Under sequestration, immigration and customs enforcement, also part of DHS, will be forced to reduce detention and removal.
[00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:17.241]  Perhaps most critically, it would have serious consequences to the flow of trade and travel.
[00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.942]  So the sequestration budget cuts are here.
[00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:29.368]  A measly $85 billion of automatic cuts because they couldn't agree on real budget cuts that will basically do nothing to the American budget.
[00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:34.231]  And yet, in the news, we have Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security,
[00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:38.793]  Look, I don't think we can maintain the same level of security at all places around the country.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.422]  Let's just call it for what it is.
[00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.343]  It's a veiled threat.
[00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.206]  It is terrorism and we know who the real terrorists are.
[00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.290]  We've seen countless false flag events from 9-11 on down.
[00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:22.466]  from the phony underwear bomber scenario used to sell body scanners to the public and of course the setting up of Homeland Security itself to terrorize the people.
[00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:31.889]  We know what it is, the dictionary definition of terrorism is the systematic use of fear or terror as a means of coercion and that's just what they're doing.
[00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.974]  And of course, Janet Napolitano says she's not trying to scare anyone, she just wants them to plan for what if.
[00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:48.402]  If there's not enough money for TSA to grow passengers and what to do if there's longer lines and you have to wait to get on a plane or if you're not able to make your flight.
[00:01:48.502 --> 00:02:00.272]  Average wait times to clear customs will increase by as much as 50% and at our busiest airports like Newark and JFK, LAX and O'Hare, peak wait times
[00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:04.162]  which can reach over two hours could easily grow to four hours.
[00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:14.456]  Homeland Security and other national security figures, Napolitano on down, don't want the public to even think that these national security apparatuses can be targeted by budget cuts.
[00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.757]  So that's why they want to reiterate the fear.
[00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:29.127]  They admittedly did it during the Bush administration using their color-coded fear chart every time Bush was down in the polls or that he faced re-election or that the public was beginning to doubt that the war on terror was real.
[00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:30.448]  Now we see it again
[00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:49.154]  As we already have in the Obama administration, the fear-mongering over checks won't go out, people are going to starve, people are going to go hungry, and then here's Napolitano adding on to that that the country will break down and passengers will have to wait in lines and the TSA won't be able to do its job and it's not our fault if there's more terror attacks.
[00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:53.495]  Well, we know who's clearly behind the stage phony terror in this country.
[00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:54.516]  We also know
[00:02:55.276 --> 00:03:05.761]  That Homeland Security and TSA have never caught a real terrorist, especially at airports, and that the only terrorists they have set up and charged are those led by admitted FBI sting operations.
[00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:14.485]  But Napolitano wants you to think that her precious Homeland Security budget is untouchable and that they have a right to occupy and control the direction of this country.
[00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:23.008]  Of course, Homeland Security's real money comes through black budgets and is used for continuity of government operations, setting up of FEMA camps and a lot more.
[00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:25.509]  No one's even pretending to touch that money.
[00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:34.552]  Under sequestration, immigration and customs enforcement, I would not be able to maintain the 34,000 detention beds as required by Congress.
[00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:39.834]  It would also reduce our investigative activities in areas like human smuggling.
[00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:51.682]  They want you to be afraid of a wave of illegal immigration, even though they're admittedly planning to give amnesty to more than 11 million immigrants, and pretty much openly don't do anything to restrict the border.
[00:03:52.063 --> 00:04:00.749]  In fact, Department of Justice and others give weapons to the drug cartels, allow them to ship in their drugs, and then launder the money on Wall Street.
[00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:14.159]  They just want to, again, control and instill fear in the American public that they're not going to do anything to stop illegal immigration one way or another, and they're certainly not going to stop terrorism, which they could just use to further their own agenda.
[00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.280]  We see through you, Janet Napolitano.
[00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:25.788]  We know that your odor comes from a defensive mechanism, like a skunk or like a stink beetle, to keep people away from your little precious jewel agency of Homeland Security.
[00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:32.673]  So they'll think they can't cut your budget and you'll just excrete this defensive odor upon the people.
[00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:33.074]  Stop it.
[00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:34.094]  You're repugnant.
[00:04:34.154 --> 00:04:35.656]  You're repugnant to the Constitution.
[00:04:35.996 --> 00:04:37.257]  Get away from our Bill of Rights.
[00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.098]  Stop using it as your toilet paper.
[00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.901]  Signing off for InfoWars.com, I'm Aaron Dyches.
[00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:48.167]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Security.
[00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:58.357]  If you try to take our money that is rightfully ours, we will unleash a legion of terrorists on you, because we need our money
[00:04:58.817 --> 00:05:05.786]  To put our hands down your pants and create terror alerts and do all kinds of things to take away your freedoms.
[00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:12.033]  And to pay for targets that look like pregnant women and old men defending their homes.
[00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:15.697]  Those are the real terrorists.
