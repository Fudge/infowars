[00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:21.802]  On a global basis, philanthropy in the United States is the envy of other countries because it's able to try out things, innovative and diverse things, although with a very high failure rate, although with enough of a success rate to really come up with big breakthroughs.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.123]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:42.263]  Multiple overseas media outlets have reported on the fact that polio vaccines linked to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and his Gavi Alliance have on record caused nearly 48,000 children in India to suffer neurological damage and become permanently paralyzed.
[00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:52.776]  Most recently, over 50 African children from Chad also began convulsing after receiving a Gates Foundation-funded meningitis vaccine that specifically targets African people.
[00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:57.522]  Those children, some as young as seven, have also subsequently become paralyzed.
[00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:08.117]  Yesterday, Bill Gates appeared at a highly controlled speaking engagement to address computer science majors at his new Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex building on the University of Texas campus.
[00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:11.437]  I was able to purchase a ticket from a student and attend the meeting.
[00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:20.440]  Though no cameras or recording equipment were allowed inside the meeting, fellow reporter David Ortiz was able to capture a live stream being fed to an adjacent room.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.141]  When the floor got open for questions, I decided to ask Mr. Gates a real one.
[00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:32.490]  What do you say to critics who claim your global vaccination program is nothing more than a eugenics program?
[00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.810]  A huge... Eugenics.
[00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.952]  Over 48,000 children in India have been paralyzed due to polio vaccines linked to your foundation.
[00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:43.392]  No, no.
[00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:48.913]  I mean, nothing has saved more lives than vaccination.
[00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:55.215]  You know, the key figure that we think about in terms of what we're prioritizing
[00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.005]  is the tragic death of young people.
[00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:06.814]  If you go back to about the time I was born, more than 20 million kids under five were dying every year.
[00:02:07.674 --> 00:02:09.897]  Smallpox, measles, a variety of things.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.503]  By 1990, even though the number of children were up because the population growth had gone up, that number had come down from over 20 million to about 12 million.
[00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:28.506]  And because of the work that the Foundation has been at the center of, we've now got that down from 12 million to less than 7 million.
[00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:39.351]  And the goal is to get it down to well under 3 million, by which time the disparity between what happens with poor children and what happens with rich children will have largely been eliminated.
[00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:43.676]  So, you know, vaccines are about saving lives, improving lives.
[00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:49.922]  There's no better tool that mankind's ever invented for absolutely those things.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.828]  The whole idea is to reduce to zero the number of kids who are being paralyzed.
[00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:07.874]  Between now and 2018, if things go well, we expect that will become the second disease ever eradicated.
[00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:18.380]  Smallpox back in the 1970s, by 1979 that was certified as the very first and so far the only disease that has been eradicated.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.304]  So we're pretty close on polio, but what it's about is every year having less and less kids who either die or are paralyzed.
[00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:26.925]  Last year it was 232.
[00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:38.298]  Not only did Bill Gates fail to directly answer my question, but let's review.
[00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:42.219]  Mr. Gates' father was a known eugenicist and the head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.280]  He admits in this clip from a 2003 PBS interview with Bill Moyers that he likes to focus on population control.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:58.282]  One issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population, reproductive health.
[00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:02.943]  But did you come to reproductive issues as an intellectual?
[00:04:03.584 --> 00:04:09.536]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in various volunteer things.
[00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:11.821]  My dad was head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.243]  It was very controversial to be involved with that.
[00:04:18.463 --> 00:04:29.191]  He went on to say, and maybe the most interesting thing I learned is this thing that's still surprising when I tell other people, which is that as you improve health in a society, population growth goes down.
[00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:37.036]  In the past, Mr. Gates has openly advocated withholding end-of-life care to the elderly and using those funds to instead hire more teachers.
[00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:44.101]  And so the access that used to be available to the middle class or whatever is just rapidly going away.
[00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:49.886]  That's a tradeoff society is making because of very, very high medical costs.
[00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:59.013]  And a lack of willingness to say, you know, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off?
[00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:04.338]  And he's also announced that the goal of vaccines is to reduce the population by 10-15%.
[00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:23.097]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:24.298]  But let's take a look.
[00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:26.841]  First we've got population.
[00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.863]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:31.945]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:41.073]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:49.388]  So what does it matter if 48,000 children suffered permanent neurological damage and were paralyzed if it's in the name of philanthropy?
[00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.377]  But the problem is these vaccines have actually been shown to cause the very diseases they're supposed to prevent.
[00:05:55.404 --> 00:06:03.308]  Bill Gates is a billionaire technocrat obsessed with population control and the idea that vaccinating the world is doing, in his words, God's work.
[00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.929]  But who's God and at what cost?
[00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.870]  Trading lives for lives?
[00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:09.451]  What kind of world is that?
[00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:13.353]  When we devalue one human life, we devalue everyone's life.
[00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:16.975]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Melton.
[00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:20.216]  Polio, the whole idea is to reduce
[00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.031]  To zero?
[00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:26.878]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
