[00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:20.851]  So what do you want to see happen with this latest shooting?
[00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:27.055]  Man, with the latest shooting, really I want to see Art Acevedo make some serious action.
[00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.477]  Somebody needs to be held accountable.
[00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:34.121]  This man is a suspect in a homicide, because that's exactly what it is.
[00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:36.643]  In your mind, is there anything that the Chief could do to bring
[00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:41.724]  Charge the detective with second-degree murder or manslaughter.
[00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:50.847]  He could also reopen investigations previously of, you know, people who have been obviously innocently killed.
[00:00:51.167 --> 00:01:02.911]  Recently the Austin Police Department saw fit to invade private property over a noise complaint of a piece of metal that was called in and they came and shot my dog when he barked at him.
[00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:05.012]  Good cops arrest bad cops.
[00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:08.334]  There's a bunch of bad cops in the Austin Police Department.
[00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.296]  Austin Police Department has killed several innocent people this year.
[00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.337]  People who are not suspected of committing any crime.
[00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:19.560]  I know there's a lot of gang violence in other cities, but we don't have that problem here.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.562]  What we have is a problem of cops wanting to shoot first and ask questions later.
[00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:29.445]  Y'all want to come out here and you want to put your shiny badge on and you want to ride around.
[00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:31.290]  And you want to check everybody out?
[00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:32.354]  Like, we're doing something.
[00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:33.858]  Not all of us are criminals.
