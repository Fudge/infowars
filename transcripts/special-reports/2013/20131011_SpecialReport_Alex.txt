[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.512]  Welcome to Tyranny Watch, I'm Gigi Ornette.
[00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:06.516]  Well, leave it to the TSA not to make your day.
[00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:11.221]  The abomination protocol is non-exclusive to age.
[00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.731]  A three-year-old was recently harassed by the TSA.
[00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:22.755]  His mother, Renee Bergeron, told Yahoo about her youngest child, Apollo, who suffers from a rare heart defect being harassed by the TSA.
[00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:28.958]  She said, I walked right up to the first agent and told her my son is tube fed and this cooler has formula and medical supplies in it.
[00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:34.340]  But instead, the TSA agent put the bag through the x-ray machine and did not give a heads up to the next agent.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.601]  That's when the agent at the machine freaked out.
[00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.243]  At that point, they surrounded me and began treating me like a suspect.
[00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:44.406]  Now, you have to watch what you say, as we reported on Infowarriors.com.
[00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:50.111]  At George Bush International Airport, they tell you that you have to watch what you say, or you might be detained.
[00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.033]  And it's true, they will detain you if they don't like what you say.
[00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:55.615]  They did this to a relative of mine two weeks ago.
[00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:05.843]  And he boarded a plane, loaded his luggage, sat down, and then all of a sudden, they stopped loading passengers, and two TSA agents came on board and removed him from the plane.
[00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:07.584]  Now, that held up the flight.
[00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:15.730]  upset quite a few of the other passengers and he wasn't told what exactly he was being detained for except he was not going to fly out that night.
[00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:23.436]  Now he's a senior citizen so obviously they don't discriminate in age if they're harassing three-year-olds and senior citizens.
[00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:27.018]  But needless to say, United called the next day and I spoke with them.
[00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:33.742]  They were trying to get him a flight out the next day, but it was too late because he had already decided to take a car and drive home.
[00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:38.705]  But what are you supposed to do when the TSA detains you and says you're not going to fly out?
[00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:42.107]  Do they seriously expect you to just obey?
[00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:44.008]  Uh, not.
[00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:45.870]  So help fight the tyranny.
