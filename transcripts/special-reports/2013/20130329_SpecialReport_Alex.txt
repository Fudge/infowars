[00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:06.735]  The cell tower linked to your wife is near a roadside motel on Highway 31.
[00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:12.496]  Typically, there's five to six agents per safe house in a designated area away from the other guests.
[00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:15.897]  I'm thinking an M-17 or my micro-Uzi with a silencer.
[00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.318]  UX military.
[00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:20.399]  I don't know.
[00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:21.539]  We're better than that.
[00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.579]  They were both raised by militia.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.260]  Well, constitutional extremists.
[00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:33.984]  The following, a Fox TV series starring Kevin Bacon, is the latest television program to demonize the militia.
[00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.125]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:45.129]  Even though the Constitution guarantees the rights of a well-regulated militia, that has not stopped the mass media from portraying the militia in a negative light.
[00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.111]  Let's take a look at these clips where the hero fights militia antagonist.
[00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:53.192]  Next Thursday, to save a young boy's life, Michael Weston takes on a militia.
[00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:54.413]  They are locked down tight.
[00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.977]  An unknown number of heavily armed militiamen have taken over the mine.
[00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:04.225]  They plan to use the salt mine as their base during the Second American Revolution, which is, they claim, imminent.
[00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:16.775]  More shows still, such as the in-development We Hate Paul Revere and Founding Fathers.
[00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:24.444]  The real programming is happening with these shows like Founding Fathers, where the guy that's pro-gun in Texas and leading the militia, he's really Al Qaeda.
[00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:29.811]  Which fits into the whole narrative that, oh, it's white Al Qaeda, or gun owners are really Al Qaeda.
[00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:36.016]  InfoWars has also documented subliminal propaganda in television shows such as AMC's Breaking Bad.
[00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:44.484]  One example is AMC's Breaking Bad television series as it depicts a meth villain as a Ron Paul supporter.
[00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:49.569]  And we'll end with a clip of Alex Jones warning of such propaganda in his film Road to Tyranny.
[00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:52.571]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:55.614]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:01:58.308 --> 00:01:58.528]  Who?
[00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:00.050]  Founding Fathers.
[00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.191]  Founding Fathers?
[00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.113]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
