[00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.191]  My name is Terry Holcomb.
[00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.796]  I am board member of TOC Texas Open Carry.
[00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:20.446]  We're coming to the Capitol to basically show our appreciation to the state of Texas for the rights that we do have.
[00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.833]  So I decided to go with a black powder
[00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:28.998]  1858 Remington Replica .44 caliber revolver.
[00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:45.153]  Firearm does not include a firearm that may have as an integral part a folding knife blade or other characteristic of weapons made illegal by this chapter, and that is an antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899
[00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:56.478]  Or, a replica of an antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899, but only if the replica does not use rimfire or centerfire ammunition.
[00:00:56.878 --> 00:00:59.098]  And mine is a ball-and-cap revolver.
[00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:06.153]  I was advised to tell you.
[00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:07.354]  Y'all can record all you want to.
[00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:09.195]  Get on that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:09.555]  How's that?
[00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.997]  Get on that side of the sidewalk and you can record all you want to.
[00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:14.438]  You crowd my trooper.
[00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:15.779]  You crowd my trooper.
[00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:16.759]  I'm not crowding your trooper, sir.
[00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.220]  I'm standing on a public sidewalk.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.941]  On that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:19.721]  This is a public sidewalk.
[00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.182]  On that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:22.083]  This is a public sidewalk.
[00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:23.824]  On that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:24.484]  Sir?
[00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:25.865]  Do you understand what I'm telling you?
[00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.546]  I understand what you're saying, sir, but this is a public sidewalk.
[00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.087]  Get on that side of the sidewalk there.
[00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:31.528]  If I don't get on that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:32.669]  You keep crowding my troops here.
[00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.351]  Look at the distance between me and your troops.
[00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:37.293]  I didn't ask you what the distance was.
[00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:39.414]  I asked you to get on that side of the sidewalk.
[00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:41.135]  I am being detained guys.
[00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:41.856]  He's being detained.
[00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:50.986]  I don't think anybody here is out there as aggressive as you.
[00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.369]  The document, I'm standing on a public sidewalk.
[00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.132]  You can see the distance between me and that officer over there.
[00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:58.235]  Can I get your name, sir?
[00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.057]  Can I get your badge number?
[00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.101]  Excuse me officer, do you have any comment as to what's going on here?
[00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:09.803]  No.
[00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:14.788]  There you go.
[00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:15.489]  Firearm.
[00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.953]  Any device designed and made to adapt and expel a projectile through the barrel.
[00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:19.613]  Keep reading.
[00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:21.415]  Energy generated by that substance.
[00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:22.276]  Keep reading.
[00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:23.017]  Don't mumble.
[00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:25.500]  Any firearm made to have integral parts.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.502]  Folding knife blades.
[00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:28.363]  Thank you.
[00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:29.484]  Let's see.
[00:02:29.624 --> 00:02:30.005]  Thank you.
[00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:32.828]  Got quiet there, Sergeant.
[00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:35.712]  I did notice that you stopped reading out loud.
[00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.233]  Can you tell us the part that you were reading?
[00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:37.894]  Yeah.
[00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:40.277]  The definition of firearm.
[00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:41.018]  Okay.
[00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:42.180]  What does it say?
[00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:59.618]  The firearm does not include a firearm that may have as an integral part a folding knife blade or other characteristic of weapons made illegal by this chapter, and that is an antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899.
[00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.700]  The definition of firearm was determined in 1898.
[00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:15.811]  How low would be great?
[00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.711]  We got cameras filming.
[00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:19.112]  Okay.
[00:03:20.212 --> 00:03:23.093]  Okay, so was that a wrestling mistake?
[00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.354]  No.
[00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:38.177]  Hey, now you can watch the Alex Jones Show live as it happens at infowars.com forward slash show.
