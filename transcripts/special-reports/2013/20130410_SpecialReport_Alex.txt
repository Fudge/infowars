[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:34.617]  If we stop one child from dying, one police officer from dying, one neighbor from dying, one loved one from dying, it is a small price to pay to go into a gun place, to buy a gun, show your driver's license, demonstrate who you are, have someone run you, in most places it's instantaneous,
[00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:37.165]  What's wrong with that?
[00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.766]  How do you argue against that?
[00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:46.830]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.294]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:57.496]  So you hang on to that.
[00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.097]  Now there's more to this story.
[00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:13.673]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight, who were down there filming all of this, witnessed that the Bloomberg-funded Wall Street Group was filling out the fake placards to make them look like they were homemade.
[00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:33.446]  And then the Austin Police Chief, who's up in DC right now lobbying against the Second Amendment with Holder and Obama and the Vice President, he came over and told Jakari, hey, I don't want the guns, you don't say that.
[00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:38.708]  All he wants is to ban high-capacity mags, that is a ban, and to register everybody.
[00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.171]  So they can confiscate.
[00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:48.956]  And Artie Cervantes is a really smart guy, so he knows full well what the plan is, and that makes it even more disgusting.
[00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:50.818]  So, here's a clip of that exchange.
[00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:54.200]  We've seen in California, they do confiscation.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.843]  Now, so far they're just for, you know, domestic abuse cases, and things like that.
[00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:03.967]  But let's say the laws are passed, and they want to ban high-capacity magazines, and if you keep your assault rifles, would you support a confiscation on that?
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:21.965]  I really feel very strongly that if we did the things that are pretty common sense in my mind, to do better, they wouldn't be talking about, there wouldn't be so much talk about confiscating or be talking about banning assault rifles or high capacity magazines.
[00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:24.906]  Registration of people who have not been convicted of any crime.
[00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:29.810]  Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with that because, to me, I registered my car for a reason.
[00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.517]  That is, so people know that's my vehicle, it belongs to me, and if anybody's found with that vehicle and it gets run, then they know there's a problem.
[00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:41.780]  When I sell my vehicle, I do what's called a lease of liability, I transfer ownership.
[00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:49.988]  Again, I know that folks really believe that if we had registration of firearms, that that's the step right before confiscation.
[00:02:50.028 --> 00:03:02.360]  And my response to that is, the day the government wants to do something silly, like go around to over 300 million Americans and take guns, 300 sets of homes with different people, they'd go house to house anyway.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.142]  Guns will be taken.
[00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:05.263]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:03:05.503 --> 00:03:06.484]  We will take all weapons.
[00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.122]  You know, whether they're registered or not.
[00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:12.824]  And I really believe that that will never happen.
[00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:18.307]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:22.069]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.711]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:29.053]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:33.916]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:35.918]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't...
[00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.724]  You don't want to think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do.
[00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:39.987]  Somebody pops around the corner.
[00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:42.374]  Gonna be shooting in America.
[00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:42.554]  Yeah.
