[00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:18.508]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this is an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
[00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:27.791]  People around the globe will assemble in protest against Monsanto's genetic manipulation of the food supply in a massive movement known as the March Against Monsanto.
[00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:35.574]  People who are fed up with Monsanto's monopoly are hoping that this march will bring global awareness to the company's diabolical reach.
[00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:40.697]  Corporations like Monsanto, their goal basically is to take over our food supply.
[00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:46.101]  Most people are not aware that their food is highly contaminated.
[00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:53.666]  They trust the FDA, thinking that the FDA is protecting them, when in fact the FDA has sold them up the river.
[00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:58.930]  Leading consumer advocate Jeffrey Smith has researched in-depth the effects of GMOs.
[00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.177]  The glyphosate, or active ingredient in Roundup, is linked to essentially every major Western disease on the rise due to diet.
[00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:20.087]  So from cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, aggression, anorexia, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autism, it's very, very dangerous.
[00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:29.057]  And it is unfortunately in high concentrations of these Roundup Ready crops, which is the vast majority of all GMOs that we eat.
[00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:32.821]  Companies like Kashi, people think that Kashi has clean food.
[00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:34.263]  Kashi's GMO.
[00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:36.705]  A lot of their products have GMOs in them.
[00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:39.408]  And so we need to bring awareness to people on
[00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.750]  Who to shop with, how to get clean food.
[00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.693]  If they can't afford to buy organic, they can work at farms and get their produce for free.
[00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:59.257]  The founders of the grassroots group, Food is Free Project, are already working to teach local communities how to provide for themselves by coming together and growing their own food.
[00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.098]  The Food is Free project was kind of born out of the idea of planting a front yard garden.
[00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:11.720]  We realized by being out in our front yard, hands in the soil, we started to meet and engage with neighbors that were walking by with their dogs or whatnot.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.301]  What if we lined a block in front yard gardens and got people, you know, connected?
[00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.822]  We try to use as many salvaged materials as possible.
[00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:22.803]  It just helps to, it just makes it a lot easier, you know.
[00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:27.264]  It doesn't have to be like a cost intensive sort of thing to get started gardening on your own.
[00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:28.878]  Chickens are great.
[00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.946]  They'll save money on eggs and go through your compost and turn it for you.
[00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:40.161]  They'll go through a field, like any spot where you want to be planting, and just having chickens there for a little while makes the soils really happy with it.
[00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:49.725]  Aquaponics is another really great way for people to grow their own food, be independent of the system, and be more self-sustaining.
[00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:54.406]  The really cool thing about this is that it's a soilless system, right?
[00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:58.808]  So this is just expanded clay and pea gravel.
[00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:02.088]  You can grow vegetables and fruits.
[00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.589]  Down here we've got our fish.
[00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.210]  We've got goldfish.
[00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.452]  You could grow tilapia.
[00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:08.795]  We aren't eating these fish.
[00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.898]  We're just growing them for their nutrients.
[00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.642]  So it's fine to just have like a little goldfish.
[00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:18.208]  And you see here how it all pays off.
[00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:28.643]  Coming together to grow a community garden is absolutely an effective way to flip the bird to companies like Monsanto.
[00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:33.727]  But in the meantime, grocery stores will still remain the main provider of our food.
[00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.831]  Even so, you can have control over what you're eating by phoning your state rep.
[00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:51.795]  We want everybody to contact them demanding the overturn of the Monsanto Protection Act and to put in place a bill that requires labeling for all GMO products.
[00:03:51.955 --> 00:04:02.418]  If we could get the GMO labeling in place, when people are shopping and they see this seal that says, contains GMO ingredients, they're going to be, well wait, what is this?
[00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:04.098]  What am I eating?
[00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:13.582]  Simply typing in your 5-digit zip code at whoismyrepresentative.com will immediately give you the phone number and website of your state representative.
[00:04:14.063 --> 00:04:29.309]  Now, we think that when about 5% of US shoppers avoid brands that contain GM ingredients, that would be sufficient to create a tipping point of consumer rejection, turning GMOs into a marketing liability, and forcing the companies to abandon GMOs.
[00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:29.589]  I think so.
[00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:56.530]  The March Against Monsanto will happen around the world on May 25th.
[00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.916]  It's all being organized online via an open Google document where you can find the protest nearest you and be a part of it.
[00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:11.722]  There are still a lot of open slots for organizers and speakers, so if you feel like contributing to the event in that capacity, be sure to check it out.
[00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:18.287]  Now you can find the link to that Google document as well as more stories on this topic at InfoWars.com.
