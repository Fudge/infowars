[00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.928]  Hi, I'm Gigi Ornetta with your InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
[00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.410]  Try, try, try again.
[00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.011]  You may have heard this before.
[00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:22.654]  It comes from an old legend of Robert the Bruce.
[00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:25.757]  He was a 14th century King of Scotland.
[00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:33.383]  He kept failing, but one day, after seven attempts, he actually beat the King of England to regain Scotland.
[00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:39.709]  Well, there's a possibility Representative Jose E. Serrano of New York came from the same school of thought.
[00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.672]  In January of this year, he proposed to get H.J.
[00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:42.972]  Res.
[00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:45.555]  15 passed committee for the ninth time.
[00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:49.239]  He's reintroduced it every congressional session since 1997.
[00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:57.588]  None of these resolutions ever made it to a floor vote, but try, try, try again.
[00:00:57.608 --> 00:00:57.648]  H.J.
[00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.130]  Res.
[00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.816]  15 proposes repealing the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which sets term limits on the presidency.
[00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:09.982]  The last and only president to serve more than two terms was Franklin D. Roosevelt.
[00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:16.287]  In 1945, a few months after the inauguration for his fourth term of office, Roosevelt died.
[00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:20.390]  And in 1951, term limits on the presidency were preserved.
[00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.992]  Some, like Cokie Roberts, feel like we should get rid of the 22nd Amendment.
[00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:27.975]  And then we wouldn't have lame duck presidencies, like the one that we have now.
[00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:34.019]  The power of the presidency, regardless of whom occupies the White House, is enormous.
[00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.840]  And this question is always asked.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.901]  And the truth is, the president is a lame duck.
[00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.423]  The 22nd Amendment is a terrible idea.
[00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:43.265]  How about a different approach?
[00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.768]  When you're done with your term, you leave.
[00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.411]  That's right, let's put term limits on House and Senate seats.
[00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:55.116]  And thank you to Representative Matt Salmon from Arizona for stepping up to the plate and getting things started.
[00:01:55.536 --> 00:02:04.124]  He recently introduced Joint Resolution 41 with five House sponsors to limit House members to three terms and Senators to two terms.
[00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.647]  Look out, Representative Serrano, your days may be numbered.
