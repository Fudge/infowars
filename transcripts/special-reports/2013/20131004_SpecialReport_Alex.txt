[00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:18.878]  About a week ago, the FBI arrested the man who allegedly owned Silk Road, an online source of illegal drugs that accepted only bitcoins.
[00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:26.330]  What is most interesting is that the FBI has not yet been able to seize over 600,000 bitcoins without his password.
[00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.132]  The FBI can't crack it?
[00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:30.014]  Or maybe they don't want to crack it.
[00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:33.457]  Maybe they want to use it as an excuse to try to shut down Bitcoin.
[00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:41.924]  While the war on drugs has been an absolute failure by any metric, the war on property rights and the war on due process has been a resounding success for the Feds.
[00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:51.253]  We've seen an abuse of civil forfeiture without due process, without people being charged with a crime, and many cases of people who have their property seized are never charged with a crime.
[00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:58.925]  So one of the key reasons to stop prohibition is the ludicrous unconstitutional extremes the government has taken in property seizures.
[00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.587]  But it isn't just that bitcoins are hard for the Feds to seize.
[00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:06.689]  They also offer something that Feds hate even more, and that's privacy.
[00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:16.053]  Under the Bank Secrecy Act, financial institutions are required to report transactions to the Feds and must also, quote, know, in other words, verify, customer identities.
[00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:21.216]  In other words, the Bank Secrecy Act means there is no secrecy with banks.
[00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:31.982]  But as we've seen with HSBC, when large banks know their customers are drug cartels or terrorists, the feds leave them alone if they're a big bank that supports the central bank fiat money scheme.
[00:01:32.543 --> 00:01:36.245]  HSBC was caught laundering money for Sinaloa and Zeta drug cartels.
[00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.367]  They were caught laundering money for Hamas, Hezbollah and Al Qaeda.
[00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:47.131]  Yet Assistant Attorney General Lanny Brewer said HSBC would almost certainly have lost its banking license in the US.
[00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.393]  In the future the institution would have been under threat
[00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:55.715]  And the entire banking system would have been destabilized if they hadn't just given them a slap on the wrist.
[00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.056]  If they had enforced the laws against money laundering.
[00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:09.519]  But HSBC was too big to jail because they serve the fiat banking system and they partner with the Feds in running drugs and in arming terrorists.
[00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.261]  The Feds hate Bitcoin because it serves as an alternative to their banking system and their control.
[00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:19.302]  They would love to destabilize it, but that's not going to be easy.
[00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:24.666]  If the government tries to shut down Bitcoin like they did Liberty Reserve, they're going to have a problem.
[00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:30.029]  There is no single person for them to move against like Budofsky at Liberty Reserve.
[00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:36.172]  Bitcoins are both anonymous and decentralized, so it will be very difficult for the Feds to try to shut it down.
[00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:38.934]  If they do, they will drive it underground.
[00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:47.499]  But if they can get a hold of the 600,000 Bitcoins, which are 5% of the outstanding total of Bitcoins at the time, they could try to destabilize it.
[00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:49.459]  Good luck with that.
[00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:52.830]  It will be very transparent if they try.
[00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.317]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:09.582]  We take this business of waking people up very seriously here at InfoWars.

[00:03:52.061 --> 00:04:00.449]  260,000 of you could be out there as Obamacare or Prozac, the killer clown.
[00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.891]  Hi kids!
[00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:05.775]  It's me, your favorite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor!
[00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:14.364]  Just cut along the dotted lines, cut some holes for the eyes and attach a few rubber bands and you are ready to wake up America this Halloween.
[00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:20.037]  Remember kids, Obamacare is for you and your family, and so is Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:04:20.377 --> 00:04:27.804]  So whatever you do, don't secure your copy of InfoWars Magazine and resist, because death is good for you.
