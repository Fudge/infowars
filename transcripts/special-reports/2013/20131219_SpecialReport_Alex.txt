[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:06.315]  The IRS, the agency who likes to use conservative groups for target practice, is back in the news once again.
[00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:11.159]  IRS vendor owed $525 million in back taxes.
[00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:18.946]  This article points out how over 1,200 vendors owe back taxes who work with the IRS, including one contractor who owes
[00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:21.328]  525 million.
[00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:22.849]  And that's just fine.
[00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:31.596]  Because as you recall, former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner didn't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes during his stint at the International Monetary Fund.
[00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:32.657]  But he isn't alone.
[00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:38.362]  Because you recall, 36 Obama aides owe over $800,000 in back taxes.
[00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:40.684]  And what about this one from earlier this year?
[00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.868]  Thousands of new IRS agents hired to enforce Obamacare.
[00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:52.251]  But as it turns out, the IRS, one of the agencies involved in policing Obamacare, want to be immune from Obamacare itself.
[00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:53.692]  Oh, the irony!
[00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:56.913]  IRS agents beg to be out of Obamacare.
[00:00:57.573 --> 00:01:08.678]  And let us not forget, Obama and the IRS, the smoking gun, President met with anti-Tea Party IRS Union Chief the day before the agency targeted the Tea Party.
[00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:19.128]  And despite her testimony trying not to implicate herself, Lois Lerner's emails reveal that she at least knew about the targeting of conservative groups before she took the stand.
[00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:22.291]  The targeting wasn't limited to political affiliations.
[00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.253]  They also targeted Christians and other conservative groups.
[00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:33.980]  The IRS can target you for your religious affiliations, they can target you for your political affiliations, or if you just flat out don't like Obamacare.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.941]  And what are they going to target you with?
[00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:38.223]  Of course, the AR-15 rifle.
[00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:44.689]  The highly publicized but statistically rarely used rifle that has gained such international media attention.
[00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:52.095]  Check InfoWars.com for more updates and to learn how the IRS isn't the only agency that has you in its sights.
[00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:18.255]  The Info Wars crew absolutely loves coffee because we love being awake.
[00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:21.898]  And I am somewhat of a connoisseur of coffee.
[00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.204]  So many times you go to a restaurant or even to a coffee shop and the coffee tastes like garbage.
[00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:41.421]  And in all the different coffees I've tried, my favorite is grown in the high mountains, in shade, Arabica, on the border with Guatemala, in Southern Mexico, by the Chiapas farmers.
[00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:49.428]  I make sure we've done the research, I make sure it's the very best product that we can offer you, when I put my name on it.
[00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:55.933]  And I believe, and it's my taste, so you may differ, that this is the best coffee in the world, from Southern Mexico.
[00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:57.934]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend, 100% organic,
[00:02:58.715 --> 00:02:59.836]  This coffee is seriously so smooth.
[00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:09.201]  I normally have to douse my coffee with cream and sugar and cinnamon and all kinds of tasty treats, but this, I drink this black.
[00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:10.122]  It is so good!
[00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:32.418]  Well, that's why I like it, is that it has a kick, it has really good caffeine in it, it has a good clean wake-up that lasts for a long time, doesn't give me a headache, but it's so smooth, it's so delicious.
[00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:34.119]  Just try it out for yourself.
[00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.221]  I'm telling you, this is my favorite coffee.
