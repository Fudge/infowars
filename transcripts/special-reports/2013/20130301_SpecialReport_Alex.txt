[00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:26.330]  You've got even neocons fessing up to what InfoWars has made the public aware of, and former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin has warned that the federal government is stockpiling bullets in preparation for civil unrest, adding that America is finished if it cannot deal with its debt problems.
[00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.452]  She wrote that on her Facebook page.
[00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:39.337]  And, you know, now you have neocons from Mark Levin, Michael Savage, now Sarah Palin, admitting that the federal government is arming itself to the teeth.
[00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:45.000]  And the only people who don't know about that now, or who act like they don't know this is going on, is the federal government.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.761]  Now you've got neocon Sarah Palin talking about this.
[00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.342]  For more on this issue, we go to our very own David Knight.
[00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:55.724]  So David Knight, tell us a little bit about your thoughts on this issue.
[00:00:56.477 --> 00:01:00.701]  Well, the media has gone into full damage control with this after Sarah Palin came out with it.
[00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.665]  You've got Politico, you've got Atlantic Wire, you've got Huffington Post.
[00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:08.909]  You've got everybody basically saying these are debunked conspiracy theories.
[00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.851]  And they're not debunked.
[00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:11.792]  We're not making this up.
[00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:16.316]  As a matter of fact, it was Politico that even linked Sarah Palin to Alex Jones.
[00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:19.199]  You know, it says she joins Alex Jones and InfoWars and looking at this.
[00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.142]  I've got a graph here that basically shows how in the last 10 months the DHS has ramped this up.
[00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:37.408]  And Watson pulled these figures from FedBiz and from a couple of different sites here that are FedBid and Federal Business Opportunities.
[00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:38.389]  This one right here
[00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:41.271]  This is actually a publication of the GSA.
[00:01:41.592 --> 00:01:46.115]  This is the main source for contractors to get information about what the federal government is buying.
[00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:47.617]  So this is public information.
[00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:49.699]  This is coming from the Fed's site.
[00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:52.841]  So there's no dispute that they're putting out bids to get these things.
[00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:55.744]  The question is, why are they buying so much ammunition?
[00:01:56.184 --> 00:02:00.088]  Well, the media has tried to explain that away with a couple of attempts.
[00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:04.592]  First they came back and they said, well, last summer they started talking about the
[00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:05.392]  We're good to go.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.286]  Then a couple months after that, they got another $750 million.
[00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:37.811]  Then another month after that, they got another $200 million.
[00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.053]  They're just ramping up on this.
[00:02:39.497 --> 00:02:48.682]  Tell us about war, like if these bullets were all, first of all, talk about hollow points very quickly, and talk about war, how let's just say this was all used for war, how long would that be for?
[00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:49.323]  Good point.
[00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:55.787]  You know, when they're talking about it being for target practice, and they're talking about saving money, hollow points are very expensive.
[00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:57.608]  You don't use those for target practice.
[00:02:57.668 --> 00:03:03.051]  So it's ludicrous from that standpoint, if you know anything about firearms, you know that they're not going to buy hollow points for firearms practice.
[00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:11.682]  But if you look back at the amount of ammunition that was being used at the peak of the Iraq War, that was five and a half million rounds a month, okay?
[00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:14.086]  So you're still looking at the quantities that they bought.
[00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:20.875]  That would be about 24 to 30 years worth of ammunition if they're fighting a war the size of the Iraq War.
[00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:24.818]  I think they want to basically starve the marketplace of ammunition.
[00:03:25.358 --> 00:03:29.522]  Because if you've got guns and no ammunition, it's like having a car with no gas.
[00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:38.449]  And one thing that they can do is they can essentially suck all the oxygen out of the marketplace, suck all the ammunition out of the marketplace with these gigantic purchases.
[00:03:38.889 --> 00:04:05.387]  But we found out just a couple of months ago, people going through and looking at the recycling documents coming out of Fort Drum in New York, found that they are not selling their once-used brass, but they're turning it, they're spending extra money to turn it into brass scrap, and selling it to the Chinese as scrap metal, instead of selling it back into the United States market as once-used brass, which would help to keep the price of ammunition down.
[00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:06.008]  Right, David.
[00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:07.148]  Thank you so much for that analysis.
[00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:07.769]  Thank you, David.
