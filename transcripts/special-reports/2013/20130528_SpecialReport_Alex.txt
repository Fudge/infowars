[00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:17.551]  Organizers of the March Against Monsanto event said that more than 2 million people in 52 countries worldwide assembled in protest of the dangers of genetically modified foods.
[00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:24.334]  Now you'd think that something that garnered this much support worldwide would be covered in detail in the mainstream media.
[00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:25.775]  But you'd be wrong.
[00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:45.930]  Admittedly, many local news outlets gave the event a small blurb in the online edition of their papers at 10 o'clock at night on Saturday, but there was a virtual blackout of the event in the mainstream media, even though this was a huge global event with hundreds if not thousands of protesters marching down the busiest streets in major cities worldwide.
[00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:56.501]  The good news is that even though this march didn't garner much mainstream media coverage, the event itself grew beyond what even the event organizer was expecting through the power of social media.
[00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:04.670]  When Tammy Connell created the March Against Monsanto Facebook page three months ago, she said she would have considered it a success if even 3,000 people had joined.
[00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:16.401]  Instead, an incredible number of people responded and turned out to rally, showing the power of social networking and the ability of the little guy to mobilize en masse.
[00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.665]  People captured video of the event and uploaded it immediately to YouTube or Ustream.
[00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:28.831]  Anti-Monsanto-related hashtags continue to pour over the Twitter feeds, and the official Facebook page now has 157,000 likes, and it's growing.
[00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:35.357]  This is how ideas and movements are spread in the modern age.
[00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:40.742]  That is why it is so important for us to fight to maintain a free and open internet.
[00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:48.229]  Even corrupt Monsanto execs and their paid-off politicians cannot stop the power of the sleeping giant once it awakens.
[00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:54.940]  Now here at InfoWars, we're going to continue to keep corrupt companies like Monsanto and other biotech giants in check.
