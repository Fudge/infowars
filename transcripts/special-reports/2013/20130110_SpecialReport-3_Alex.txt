[00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:07.224]  Aaron Dykes for InfoWars.com here.
[00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.006]  I'm going to make this as brief as I can.
[00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:20.297]  The state of Wyoming is introducing legislation this week for a Gun Protection Act, a bill that would uphold the Second Amendment and refuse to comply with any unconstitutional gun grabs.
[00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:27.585]  It would further make it a felony to try to enforce so-called laws or policies that violate the Second Amendment.
[00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:34.587]  They would make any federal law banning semi-automatic firearms or limiting the size of gun magazines unenforceable.
[00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:40.788]  Now what's really exciting is this is the beginning of a slowly building movement gaining momentum.
[00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:45.329]  Last week we saw a police chief at a small town in Pennsylvania come on the air.
[00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:56.612]  He announced publicly he was going to introduce a second amendment protection ordinance that says no we're going to nullify any unconstitutional gun laws and we will not enforce them within our boundaries.
[00:00:56.812 --> 00:01:18.008]  What I'm trying to do is have our council in the borough of Gilberton recognize the Second Amendment, stand behind the citizens of the United States and the Second Amendment, and that they're not going to infringe on the Second Amendment regarding any state, local, or federal laws, rules, or regulations that may or may not come down.
[00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.950]  Now, what prompted you to do this?
[00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.192]  Everything that's going on right now in Washington.
[00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:32.115]  States, local areas, counties, sheriffs, they all need to stand up and say no to violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:33.355]  It's our American heritage.
[00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.536]  It was put there by the founders for a reason.
[00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:46.360]  It's an attempt to have a check and balance against tyrannical government to keep one faction from getting too much power and using it as leverage over the rest of the country, the rest of the peoples.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.921]  We must learn about nullification.
[00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.883]  It's upheld under the 10th Amendment of the Bill of Rights.
[00:01:52.244 --> 00:02:03.111]  It says that all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people and that's exactly what we need to recognize and uphold.
[00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.873]  We need counties, states to say no
[00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.614]  We're not going to violate the Second Amendment and we're not going to cooperate with the Feds.
[00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:14.635]  We need people to be patriots and stand up and be firm on this issue.
[00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:28.899]  And if enough people do that in enough areas throughout the country, the Feds will recognize, the Washington lawmakers will recognize that they've gone too far and they will back off from their attempts to curtail and outright violate and ban the Second Amendment.
[00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.159]  If we do that, we could stop this thing peaceably.
[00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.100]  We don't want a civil war in this country.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.202]  And so we hope this kind of legislation at whatever level of government will spread virally throughout the country.
[00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:46.124]  You need to call your state lawmakers where there's still a lot of constitutionally minded people in those positions.
[00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:49.646]  You need to call your cities and try to influence them to do this.
[00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:53.367]  It'll of course be harder in the mega cities in the big urban areas.
[00:02:53.687 --> 00:03:00.369]  But especially in the rural areas where people still understand what this country is about, we need to make that message loudly resounded.
[00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.570]  We need to educate people about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and what is nullification.
[00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.472]  I recommend checking out InfoWars.com as well as places like the 10th Amendment Center.
[00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:11.632]  Let's do this people!
[00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:13.632]  We can turn this thing around before it's too late.
[00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:15.653]  Signing off for InfoWars.com
