[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:00.529]  I'm with you.
[00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:10.151]  I think people don't fully understand how the government can be co-opted to do things against its own people's interests if certain incentives are provided to those inside the government.
[00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:11.812]  Well, the book just came out last week.
[00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.892]  I haven't read it yet, but you told me Bohemian Grove's in it.
[00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:19.853]  So then I kind of connected dots off the storyline because there's really only a few real scenarios.
[00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:25.034]  So I can't wait to read it because I know a lot of it's actually stuff that wouldn't get out there if it wasn't fiction.
[00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:27.635]  But in closing, give us a hint.
[00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:34.080]  I mean, don't give away too much because I'm going to read it about the last line with Colonel Anthony Schaefer and William H. Keith.
[00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.183]  But Bohemian Grove, are they the bad guys?
[00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.644]  Or is something hatched in there?
[00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:38.724]  Wow.
[00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:40.844]  Something hatched in there, yeah.
[00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:44.988]  Again, you know, I've seen you when you did the show on the Bohemian Grove.
[00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.651]  I don't want to say it didn't influence our thinking, because it did.
[00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:57.399]  But just be aware, as you just point out, there's certain elements of the government who may work against our own people's interests, and it's tied into the Bohemian Grove.
[00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:58.520]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.201]  Unbelievable.
[00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.723]  I can't wait to have you on after I've read it.
[00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:04.466]  Colonel Schaefer, thank you so much for joining us.
