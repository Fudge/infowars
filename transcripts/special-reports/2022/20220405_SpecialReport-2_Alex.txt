[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.892]  Tributes are pouring in tonight for a titan of 20th century diplomacy.
[00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.155]  Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as U.S.
[00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.957]  Secretary of State, has died of cancer at the age of 84.
[00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:22.505]  She served under President Bill Clinton, and in a statement the former president and Hillary Clinton said of Albright tonight, few leaders have been so perfectly suited for the times in which they served.
[00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:29.981]  The most famous thing I ever said was that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.180]   One of Albright's last public appearances was delivering a eulogy at Colin Powell's funeral.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:51.381]   Because democracy basically means peace.
[00:00:51.381 --> 00:01:01.381]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:04.933]  Government by the people, of the people, for the people.
[00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:12.013]  but the people are retarded.
[00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:23.013]  So let us say, "Government by the retarded!"
[00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:33.013]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:37.253]   for the retarded, of the retarded.
[00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:38.611]  (audience laughing)
[00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:53.993]   Even the famous cult leader guru Osho understood the danger of the mad hell of pure democracy That the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, warned the world about.
[00:01:54.793 --> 00:02:02.419]  In a republic, you generally have two parties so that the people can balance power between those.
[00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.742]  You try to separate the government into different factions.
[00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.945]  In our country, we have the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:27.055]   And it is that separation of powers That stops cults or gangs or organized crime syndicates or dictators, oligarchies to be able to get control.
[00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:30.697]  Because you don't just split up the federal government into three branches.
[00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:36.581]  You then separate federal and state power and then you have state and local power.
[00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:39.405]  Because it all comes from we the people.
[00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:47.782]  It's all designed to stop the type of tyrannies that have been seen destroying amazing civilizations throughout history.
[00:02:49.246 --> 00:03:06.462]  And so when we see what's happening in the world today under radical leftist bullying, it's mega corporations coming in and taking over governments, getting their politicians and operatives into place who swear allegiance to the code of the Davos Group, which is the Bilderberg Group.
[00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:07.863]  Klaus Schwab heads up both.
[00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:12.282]   And their goal, you're now seeing it, is a post-industrial world.
[00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:14.804]  Feudalism making you very, very poor.
[00:03:14.804 --> 00:03:17.484]  And that's just the people that are allowed to survive.
[00:03:17.484 --> 00:03:21.123]  They want at least a 90% population reduction.
[00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:25.804]   Then the globalists have their private jets, their huge estates, their fabulous wealth.
[00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.683]  They enjoy all the technology.
[00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:29.403]  They enjoy all the medicine.
[00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:31.364]  They enjoy the culture.
[00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.723]  You get starved to death and killed.
[00:03:34.723 --> 00:03:37.242]  So this is really the issue of our age.
[00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:46.003]   And this is the issue for all of human history now, if we allow ourselves to go under this incredible tyranny.
[00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:50.082]   Just a few weeks ago, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright died.
[00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:56.043]   And the media around the world celebrated her as just the most wonderful thing ever, because she
[00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:59.524]  was the first Secretary of State who was a female.
[00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:07.186]  But if you look at what she actually did, she supported wars, she supported sanctions that killed millions and millions of people.
[00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:20.009]  And just in Iraq, it was estimated by the UN, 500,000 plus children just under the sanctions that she put on Iraq during Bill Clinton's administration.
[00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:32.103]  Herbert Walker had already put some sanctions on them, but the Clintons tripled it at her suggestion, and they wouldn't even let basic antibiotics get into the country, and a half million children died.
[00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:36.666]  And she famously said that it was a good price to pay.
[00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:39.948]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:45.251]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:49.234]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:54.939]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:16.914]  It's important on this April 5th, 2022 Tuesday broadcast to pull back at a 35,000 foot view and ask yourself, why is the entire leftist media, the corporate media from Japan to Europe, to the UK, Australia, the US praising this woman two weeks after she died?
[00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.075]  It's still all over television.
[00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:20.392]  It's still all over the newspapers.
[00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:20.692]  Why?
[00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:31.259]  Because they're rewriting history, ladies and gentlemen, while they pick out other individuals and groups who they want to villainize, who they want to demonize.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.145]  And it's only when the public has very short attention spans and doesn't know about history that they're able to be manipulated with this information.
[00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:41.806]  Here's a case point example.
[00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:51.320]   If you go out and ask the general public about Sandy Hook ten years ago, Bunch of children being shot to death in Sandy Hook, Connecticut.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.681]  People are going to say, Alex Jones.
[00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:55.841]  Believe me, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:56.822]  I experienced it on the street.
[00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:00.262]  Some people walk up to me and say, you killed the children.
[00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:02.863]  That's mind control.
[00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.564]  That's a dumbed down population.
[00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:10.645]  But that's how the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton five years ago, six years ago, when Trump was winning, got upset.
[00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:12.786]  They knew that I was leading a major populist movement.
[00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:14.943]  They said, what do we do?
[00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:20.570]  Well, we look at Jones's history, things he's covered, things he's questioned, and we make him the Sandy Hook man.
[00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:29.980]  And then anytime people talk about Alex Jones, we get to bring Sandy Hook back up and go after everybody's guns again.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.003]  But more importantly, use the attack on Alex Jones to set the precedent to then take people's free speech away.
[00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:41.885]  And again, this could only be done with an extremely dumbed down public.
[00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:45.307]  And so what's happened is we don't have a separation of powers to a great extent anymore.
[00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:51.350]  And we have the judicial branch that is becoming its own tyranny.
[00:06:52.138 --> 00:07:01.497]   and that is engaging in any type of activity they wish because there's no real checks and balances on them.
[00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:09.337]   So when you have the perfect storm of a dumbed down, historically illiterate population with mega corporations
[00:07:09.337 --> 00:07:17.177]   that are extremely predatory, you get a perfect storm of what they call technocratic tyranny.
[00:07:17.366 --> 00:07:26.612]  And that's what this whole cashless society, programmable money systems that are being announced and the world government that's being announced is actually rolling out right now.
[00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:41.710]   Now remember that same corporate media for decades told you world government doesn't exist, New World Order doesn't exist, there's no Bilderberg Group, and now it's all out in the open because they're going from beta Accelerating into operational.
[00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:50.876]  And everybody needs to be concerned about this going into operational because its plan is at least 80% depopulation by 2030.
[00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:53.798]  And you can see how that's now beginning all over the world.
[00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:57.401]  So humanity must become the checks and balances again.
[00:07:57.421 --> 00:07:58.942]  We must identify who the enemies are.
[00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:01.083]  We must understand how they manipulated us.
[00:08:01.123 --> 00:08:08.588]  And we've got to say, why is Madeleine Albright a hero when she gave the orders to kill a half a million children and said on TV she was proud of it?
[00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:16.436]  How is George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator that bankrupted more than 20 nations systems and stole old people's pension funds?
[00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:19.158]  How is he a hero, but Alex Jones is bad?
[00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:26.325]  This is bigger than Alex Jones, but just think about the power of the corporate media to demonize someone for questioning events.
[00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:28.607]  There's been so many staged events in history.
[00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:33.090]  And that's the ultimate crime, is questioning the official narrative.
[00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.012]  But when you actually kill a half million children deliberately, it's now a good thing.
[00:08:38.412 --> 00:08:40.793]  That is nothing less than mind control.
[00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:57.782]   So when we see men posing as women, wearing admiral outfits, and men in women's wrestling choking out women, and when we see open borders, and we see the Supreme Court justice nominee saying she can't say what a woman is, And we witnessed the devaluation of our currency and all of this.
[00:08:58.463 --> 00:09:02.726]  This is the checks and balances of good people not being involved, being removed.
[00:09:03.347 --> 00:09:07.209]  And into that vacuum comes all the tyrants, all the criminals, all the evil people.
[00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.972]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, what is the level of tyranny humans will live under?
[00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:13.534]  And he said, it is the level to which you will accept.
[00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:17.097]  There's always someone more evil to come into the vacuum.
[00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:18.877]  When good people don't stand up.
[00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:21.038]  And so it's accelerating.
[00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:24.218]  It's getting worse and worse by the day.
[00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:32.980]  And people have to understand that being lazy, not being engaged, going along with political correctness is basically sucking the oxygen out of the room and it's going to destroy us.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.521]  And that having courage and questioning and being involved and standing up against censorship is the answer.
[00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:52.698]   There's an article on InfoWars.com today by Paul Watson where the big National Museum of Art In the UK is changing the names of art, taking any names that basically say Russian off of them.
[00:09:53.298 --> 00:09:56.840]  We have to decide who we are and what we stand for.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.502]  We're going to lose our entire culture, our entire civilization.
[00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:02.082]  It really just comes down to that.
[00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:05.384]  It's the decision that all of us have to make because things are only going to get worse.
[00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:09.387]  The more we live in denial, it's only going to get better by standing up and doing the right thing.
[00:10:09.748 --> 00:10:11.809]  Some of us will be demonized who are at the tip of the spear.
[00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.750]  That's okay.
[00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:18.669]   I volunteered for this because not standing up and being a total slave is a fate far worse.
[00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:31.469]   I just want to thank listeners because we're in the thick of the battle now.
[00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:38.224]  We're at the most critical point and nobody else has audiences this big that will tell the truth like we're doing.
[00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.206]  You did this.
[00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:41.227]  You are the info war.
[00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:52.390]  So, I want to encourage listeners to understand, if we hadn't sold 10,000 coins in December, the first part of the three-part series of the Liberty Coin, we would not be able to be operating right now.
[00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.451]  We need to sell all three of the series.
[00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:56.671]  The third is being minted right now here in America.
[00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:59.452]  The second is here in our warehouse shipping out today.
[00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:00.913]  It will sell out the next week.
[00:11:01.053 --> 00:11:02.173]  It's the Liberty Tree edition.
[00:11:02.253 --> 00:11:04.874]  The blood of patriots and tyrants must be shed for freedom.
[00:11:05.094 --> 00:11:11.075]  It is available at InfowarsStore.com right now, or 1776coin.com.
[00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:20.657]  And if we are able to stay on air, and if we stop nuclear war and all this, in the next few months we're planning to do some very special things, very special projects for just the members that are part of this.
[00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:21.958]  That's why it's called a Founding Member Coin.
[00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:25.498]  But regardless, you're keeping us on air, and I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:12:44.477 --> 00:12:47.900]  And fighting back against their unrestricted, undeclared war against us.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.821]  People come after me?
[00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:51.063]  I fight 50 times harder.
[00:12:51.723 --> 00:12:54.265]  So now the globalists declared war on me and my family?
[00:12:54.705 --> 00:12:56.487]  Well, we are gonna turn up the heat.
[00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.871]  Open up the cans of anti-New World Order resistance, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:24.727]  And then we will continue to give you the truth.
[00:13:24.747 --> 00:13:26.609]  We will continue to stand against the New World Order.
[00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:28.151]  We will continue to not back down.
[00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:30.133]  Because I will never give up!
[00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:32.695]  I will never back down.
[00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:34.776]  But I could collapse.
[00:13:34.976 --> 00:13:35.977]  I could give out.
[00:13:36.377 --> 00:13:38.078]  And it's you that's going to hold us up in this fight.
[00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.600]  And I need money to prosecute this war against Soros and the New World Order.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.341]  Our defensive war for our children.
[00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:44.602]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:45.322]  Go there now.
[00:13:45.402 --> 00:13:49.004]  We need major funding in our counteroffensive against the New World Order.

[00:13:50.402 --> 00:14:01.002]   Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[00:14:01.002 --> 00:14:04.523]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[00:14:04.523 --> 00:14:06.522]  [Music]
[00:14:06.164 --> 00:14:09.306]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:15.709]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation great reset combine.
[00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.753]  Trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[00:14:22.473 --> 00:14:28.817]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers.
[00:14:29.677 --> 00:14:37.702]  That are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[00:14:38.323 --> 00:14:39.784]  And none of it can succeed.
[00:14:39.884 --> 00:14:44.807]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:49.450]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.393]  And that's why it's hard to share InfoWars links and Bandai video links.
[00:14:53.453 --> 00:14:55.334]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
