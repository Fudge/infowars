[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  [Music]
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  [Music]
[00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:44.495]  We're playing a little guessing game right now.
[00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.797]  Where am I in the United States?
[00:00:48.758 --> 00:01:02.507]  Well, I'm on the East Coast and I'm in the state of Connecticut in a college town of New Haven at a very important historical site to any American that wants to understand the true elites that run this country and much of the world.
[00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:18.993]   So what we have is a secret society which over the last 150 years has accumulated About 2,500 members, of whom perhaps 500 are alive today.
[00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:27.538]  Of this 500, perhaps 100 are actively in pursuit of the objectives of the Order.
[00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:33.961]  It's not another college fraternal society.
[00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.565]  You have been chosen to become members of America's most secret society.
[00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:50.574]   For over a hundred years, Skull & Bones members included a president, vice presidents, Supreme
[00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:57.814]   Court justices, congressmen and senators, captains of science and industry, the very
[00:01:57.814 --> 00:02:09.854]  best of America.
[00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:10.854]  And there she blows.
[00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:14.061]  One of the most famous secret societies in the world.
[00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:16.605]  The most famous here in the United States.
[00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:17.806]  That's the Order of Death.
[00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:23.969]  Lodge 322 of Skull and Bones set up in 1832 by the Russell Trust out of Germany.
[00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.350]  That was the trust that controlled the major global opium trade.
[00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:35.615]  And out of this has come at least three presidents, a bunch of Supreme Court justices, you name it, out of this organization right here, the Order of Death.
[00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:39.597]  And it's not the only secret society here in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale.
[00:02:39.677 --> 00:02:45.640]  Yale University is 300 years old this year, and were you to visit its campus, you would see that it still has exotic clubhouses.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.684]  Which look like tombs where Yale's legendary secret societies meet.
[00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:56.870]  Their prestige and importance have largely evaporated, but the rituals are still a secret.
[00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.475]  So here we are at Skull & Bones, in amongst all this classic Gothic architecture.
[00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.417]  That's really the ruins of the Old Republic.
[00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:06.779]  We have another entrance.
[00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:09.004]  Two skull and bones.
[00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:18.318]  And back over that wall, in that courtyard, is where ABC News caught the footage of them doing a satanic ritual dedicated to Satan.
[00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:23.975]  You have the doorway here, then to the right you have a hedge, and then you have an evergreen tree.
[00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:28.118]  If you follow that line straight back, the courtyard's in there.
[00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:29.659]  So that's where they have the ceremonies?
[00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.880]  The outdoor part of it.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.901]  Part of it was indoors.
[00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:33.242]  So we only got to see the outdoor part.
[00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:33.883]  Right.
[00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:36.084]  We only got to listen to the outdoor part.
[00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:37.525]  God only knows what went on indoors.
[00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:38.626]  And what did you hear?
[00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:39.567]  What was it you knew?
[00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:41.689]  You managed to get this unique accent to it.
[00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.890]  Oh, it was disgusting.
[00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.970]  It was gross.
[00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:48.734]   I mean, they were pretending to murder people, What was the tone of it, though?
[00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:50.314]  Was it jokey?
[00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.635]  No, it wasn't jokey at all.
[00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:53.475]  It was... it was sick.
[00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:56.536]  That's about the only way I can describe it.
[00:03:56.737 --> 00:04:00.998]  It was sick.
[00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:06.480]  What you're hearing is the first recording ever made of the Skull & Bones initiation ceremony.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840]  It has never been broadcast before.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840]  We're having fun! We're having fun!
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840]  We're having fun!
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.840]  Through this gate is where they do the rituals.
[00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:24.836]   Through this gate is where the country's future controllers are put together to carry out very dark, twisted acts to
[00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:28.497]  cement them in the darkness of a cult.
[00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:35.497]  We're having fun! We're having fun! We're having fun!
[00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:41.897]   Fifteen new members of the club are being introduced into the macabre rituals of Skull & Bones by the senior students
[00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.497]  who are about to graduate.
[00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:49.455]  The club has what some might see as a strange fascination with death, skulls and bones.
[00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:56.816]  as the chance to.
[00:04:56.816 --> 00:05:00.816]   claim to be historical but Skull and Bones is extremely historical.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:15.420]   Nobody knew anything about it until during the Senator Frank Church Committee hearings back in the 1970s, Charlotte Isserby, who was a daughter of a Skull & Bones member, leaked You understand that whatever we discuss here doesn't leave this room?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.200]  Of course.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.939]   to them. And many, many years later, it was Robert De Niro that produced a major film
[00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.020]   titled The Good Shepherd that was basically based on those historical documents.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.020]   You understand that whatever we discuss here doesn't make this room?
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.020]  Of course.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.020]   We'll eventually get involved in this war, not because we want to, but because we have
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   to and we should. And the president has asked me to look into creating a foreign intelligence
[00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.488]   And if that happens, I'll be looking for patriotic, honorable, bright young men from the right
[00:05:46.488 --> 00:06:04.887]  backgrounds to manage the various departments.
[00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.608]   You'd be trained and commissioned in the Army and posted overseas.
[00:06:07.906 --> 00:06:10.849]  If it's something you're interested in, you'd have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice.
[00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:14.792]  I don't want your answer now.
[00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:15.532]  Just think about it.
[00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:19.575]  But this isn't a bunch of fraternity boys sitting around playing with their pricks.
[00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:20.976]  This is for real.
[00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:22.538]  For America.
[00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:25.400]  Bonesman!
[00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:40.592]  It was President Taft who took over Bohemian Grove in Northern California and turned it into an offshoot of Skull & Bones for the graduates to go to and conduct some of the same rituals.
[00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:42.193]  And that's on record in their own annals.
[00:06:42.233 --> 00:07:00.078]   So when people think about Bohemian Grove that I really popularized, made it more famous when I infiltrated it in the year 2000, This is where they send their young people to get them into the sex orgies and the Satanism and the channeling demonic spirits up front.
[00:07:00.358 --> 00:07:04.300]  So this is just kind of the hors d'oeuvre before they get sent off to the other German death cults.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:14.142]  In fact, if you go back, Men in Power as a Political Retrospective was written by Helmut Schmidt, who was German Chancellor back when it was still West Germany.
[00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:18.384]  And he said, oh, I love the groves we have in Germany where we do our druidic rituals.
[00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:24.471]   But he said, What they have at Bohemian Grove is my favorite offshoot of our Lodge 322.
[00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:30.817]  So this is a lodge of really a druidic, we call it a German death cult, but really it's a druidic death cult.
[00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:34.820]  So you see the Nazis wearing the Order of the Deathshead skull and the lightning bolts.
[00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:36.342]  This is not a Nazi lodge.
[00:07:36.802 --> 00:07:38.564]  The Nazis were a lodge of this.
[00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:42.447]  But you're not going to see the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center talking about that.
[00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:45.310]  They're too busy giving George Soros a Nazi collaborator.
[00:07:45.888 --> 00:07:48.891]  And of course Arnold Schwarzenegger awards, because they're actual Nazis.
[00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:50.012]  But here it is!
[00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:53.636]  This is a group that predates the Nazis, but of the same order of death.
[00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:56.419]  Order of the death said is actually its true term.
[00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.122]  But they don't have little skull and crossbows like a pirate.
[00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:00.903]  It wears a crown.
[00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:05.107]  And so that's their mascot, is a skull with a crown on it, and then two crossbows.
[00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:11.815]  And again, it means that you're all their slaves, and that you all deserve to be their slaves, and that you are basically subhuman.
[00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:15.117]  And so here they are, ladies and gentlemen, they finance the Third Reich, everything!
[00:08:15.638 --> 00:08:17.979]  And just like Bill Gates' dad, they're not in any trouble.
[00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:27.527]  Skull and Bones, the order at Yale, 15 of them selected, out of every junior class.
[00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:29.474]  They paid.
[00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:35.498]  Wall Street financed Hitler, financed Stalin, creating communism, which is what they did.
[00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:39.260]  That's all very bad, and Skull & Bones is all involved in that, with the Order.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:53.047]   They concerned the build-up of the three types of socialism, Bolshevik socialism in Russia, What we might call welfare socialism in the United States, and Hitlerian or National Socialism.
[00:08:53.647 --> 00:09:04.390]  And each book examines the financing and the contributions made by Wall Street, by international bankers, to the development of that specific form of socialism.
[00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:20.964]  It also was involved in changing the American education system from a classical, academic, brain-oriented thinking, destroying that, and imposing an animal training method, which Skull and Bones were deeply involved in, and I think I would just say THE.
[00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:28.845]   only entity at that time deeply involved and managed to bring that wretched system of operant
[00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:33.325]   conditioning, Pavlov skin or whatever you want to call it, animal training, out of the
[00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:40.325]   laboratory in Leipzig, Germany, Wilhelm Wundt, and get it adopted by leading American educators.
[00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:47.325]   My father and grandfather were members of the order. It was a very important organization.
[00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:54.323]   It was a very important organization. It was a very important organization. It was a very
[00:09:54.323 --> 00:09:56.323]  members of the order.
[00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.535]  Skull and Bones was put together by William Russell in 1830.
[00:10:00.637 --> 00:10:02.499]  Secret Society at Yale University.
[00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:08.330]  And the connections with Germany are pretty extensive.
[00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:19.632]  And the Illuminati, of course, was Bavarian Marxist society based on destroying the family, destroying the church, which at that time was Catholicism.
[00:10:20.513 --> 00:10:26.614]  I have, you know, the Proofs of Conspiracy by Robeson, an original copy of that.
[00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:33.699]   And it says right in there, you know, where the order It's interesting, the order, right?
[00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:42.382]  The goal was to, just as I said, down with the family, down with the royalty.
[00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:45.944]  At that time, governments were royalty, and they were religious.
[00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:47.865]  That was Western European, right?
[00:10:49.846 --> 00:10:56.729]  Down with nationalism, get rid of countries, drop borders, drop borders!
[00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:59.568]  I mean, and people think that that's new?
[00:10:59.568 --> 00:11:09.568]   Inside that building, they have the skull of Geronimo that they stole,
[00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.568]  President Martin Van Buren, and others.
[00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:13.099]  But that's not the most important part.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.783]  They lay in coffins and are reborn and channel these spirits.
[00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:20.745]  They also tell each other all their deepest, darkest secrets.
[00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:27.751]  So this is literally a satanic sex cult that was all male before because they would engage in homosexual sex acts.
[00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:33.996]  But now the girls get to be involved in this organization, and then they're part of this cult that goes forward.
[00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.571]  Into the future, building their final aim, their final goal.
[00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:39.752]  And what is their final goal?
[00:11:40.152 --> 00:11:43.693]  Well, that they be kings of the earth and rule over us, the slaves.
[00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:48.154]  But don't look for CNN or MSNBC to criticize this organization.
[00:11:48.514 --> 00:11:48.814]  No, no, no.
[00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:57.577]  They're there to create dissension and divide and conquer amongst the people, not actually go after really corrupt, evil organizations that actually supported the Nazis before World War II.
[00:11:59.257 --> 00:12:01.018]  But it's okay because they let girls in now, so it's all right.
[00:12:02.438 --> 00:12:05.381]  Harlan Geronimo is the warrior's great-grandson.
[00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:18.776]  He and other descendants are suing Yale University and the secret society known as the Order of Skull and Bones, claiming Geronimo's skull was stolen back in 1918 by Yale students, members of the secret order.
[00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:27.183]  One of the alleged grave robbers, Yaley Prescott Bush, the father and grandfather of Presidents 41 and 43.
[00:12:27.263 --> 00:12:33.129]  For decades, members called Bonesmen dismissed the suggestion as a hoax.
[00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:39.617]  But a Bonesman's letter written in 1918, discovered two years ago at Yale, suggests otherwise.
[00:12:40.157 --> 00:12:44.099]  Quote, the skull of the worthy Geronimo the Terrible exhumed.
[00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:50.762]  Now safe inside, the T. T is believed short for the Tomb, the Bonesman's private club.
[00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:55.104]  Now we just saw a young lady go in here and do a little passcode and opened up, she went in.
[00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:57.465]  We're free Americans, there's not a gate here.
[00:12:57.786 --> 00:13:00.367]  We're gonna go knock on the door and see if they invite us into their castle.
[00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.546]  or into their tomb as it's called.
[00:13:02.546 --> 00:13:12.546]  I wonder if Count Dracula is going to answer.
[00:13:12.546 --> 00:13:14.546]  I wonder what this is.
[00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:18.546]  Oh, there is a little code system on the door.
[00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:20.749]  I wonder if it's 666 to enter.
[00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:28.754]  Look, you've got like a old safe door right there.
[00:13:29.135 --> 00:13:30.495]  Hi, it's Alex Jones!
[00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:32.837]  I was just here.
[00:13:32.857 --> 00:13:35.899]  I'm selling encyclopedia subscriptions.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.621]  Actually, I'm a contact tracer.
[00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:42.967]  You were both in Skull and Bones, The Secret Society.
[00:13:43.007 --> 00:13:45.568]  It's so secret we can't talk about it.
[00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:48.567]  I know you care about us, you want to depopulate us.
[00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:50.166]  So again, I just dropped by.
[00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:56.766]   Thanks for Granddaddy Bush and Prescott Bush, the main Nazi lawyer in the US, and then George
[00:13:56.766 --> 00:13:59.246]  Herbert Walker Bush, and then of course his son.
[00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:02.727]  You were both in skull and bones with the secret society.
[00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:04.246]  It's so secret we can't talk about it.
[00:14:04.246 --> 00:14:06.687]  What does that mean for America?
[00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:08.527]  The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.
[00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:09.528]  I'm not sure they are.
[00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:09.969]  I don't know.
[00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:11.169]  I haven't seen the web.
[00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:11.509]  Number 322?
[00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:17.152]  You both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale.
[00:14:17.512 --> 00:14:18.173]  What does that tell us?
[00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:20.434]  Not much, because it's a secret.
[00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:23.044]  Is there a secret handshake?
[00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:24.105]  Is there a secret code?
[00:14:24.586 --> 00:14:27.408]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest.
[00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.408]  322?
[00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:28.770]  A secret number?
[00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.873]  There are all kinds of secrets, Tim, but one thing is not a secret.
[00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:35.557]  I disagree with this president's direction that he's taking the country.
[00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.719]  We can do a better job, and I intend to do it.
[00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:49.344]   So we thought we'd come by and see if anybody's home, bang on the tomb door, and I guess everybody I guess everybody's asleep inside there right now.
[00:14:50.144 --> 00:14:51.684]  Everything's fine inside the tomb.
[00:14:51.744 --> 00:14:55.485]  Well, make sure you're locked and snugged into your little tomb.
[00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:58.146]  That'll be a good place for you into eternity here.
[00:14:58.586 --> 00:15:02.367]  We're all going to take our COVID mRNA vaccines and get cancer.
[00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:06.328]  Something tells me you're not going to be taking your cancer shots.
[00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:10.109]  Alright, well, cheerio, old fellas!
[00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:14.470]  Have fun inside your tomb while you wrestle around in feces.
[00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:17.027]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:19.388]  And we've got some folks here.
[00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:22.930]  Yes, I know they mainly meet on Thursdays for official meetings, but they're inside right now.
[00:15:27.573 --> 00:15:28.433]  Former bonesman.
[00:15:28.734 --> 00:15:29.694]  Living or dead?
[00:15:29.954 --> 00:15:30.235]  Living.
[00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:31.175]  But you'd better hurry.
[00:15:32.356 --> 00:15:33.576]  Engage cloaking device.
[00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:41.006]  Nothing relaxes me like a stiff drink from the skull of Martin Van Buren.
[00:15:41.266 --> 00:15:43.248]  Care for some Pancho Villa?
[00:15:43.828 --> 00:15:46.830]  Has everything in this school surrendered to diversity?
[00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.873]  I could start my own college.
[00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:51.974]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:15:52.154 --> 00:15:53.575]  We can't talk business in here.
[00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:55.657]  Just general schemes for world domination.
[00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:56.818]  Fraternal handshake.
[00:15:58.299 --> 00:15:59.360]  Oh, alright.
[00:16:03.883 --> 00:16:05.204]  You are on my radar.
[00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:24.702]  Here we are under this amazing cathedral with this incredible chimes coming out of it, and just a few hundred yards away is Skull and Bones, a temple to global secret societies, a temple to the CIA.
[00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:28.103]  It was this organization on record that helped found the CIA in 19...
[00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:40.587]  47.
[00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:40.587]  And we only know about this because of Charlotte Isby, whose father, on his deathbed, confessed to her the secrets of Skull & Bones and gave her the secret documents that she gave them to Anthony Sutton with the Senate report.
[00:16:42.548 --> 00:16:44.709]  And that's the reason we even know about Skull & Bones.
[00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:51.632]  That's why it's important for reporters to expose Bohemian Grove, Skull & Bones, the secrets of the Davos group in Bilderberg.
[00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:58.451]  Because that's how we understand that these groups organize and try to use their power to consolidate more power over us.
[00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:00.192]  They're the people behind the Great Reset.
[00:17:00.212 --> 00:17:02.273]  They're the people behind the big globalist power grab.
[00:17:03.073 --> 00:17:08.695]  And again, that's why we're here, truly speaking truth to power, and trying to just get the population aware of the fact that these things do exist.
[00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:09.655]  That's why we're here.
[00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:11.456]  Guests of the New World Order!
[00:17:12.176 --> 00:17:12.796]  Bonesmen!
[00:17:15.377 --> 00:17:16.178]  All here!
[00:17:17.158 --> 00:17:19.299]  And nobody gets a selfie with Stuntman Bones in the background.
[00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:28.717]  Throughout the ages, every human culture has noticed that there are strange things that happen.
[00:17:29.357 --> 00:17:35.020]  There's something about timing in the universe, serendipity, synchronicity, clairvoyance.
[00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:39.723]  Everyone recognizes that there's something going on, there's something hidden.
[00:17:40.324 --> 00:17:41.424]  That's what the occult means.
[00:17:42.045 --> 00:17:46.968]  We were in Connecticut on a totally separate matter, myself and just two members of the crew.
[00:17:47.930 --> 00:18:29.718]   And upon returning on 3-2-3-21, Rob Dew, one of my oldest crew members and the cameraman that shot the footage you've just watched, said, Alex, do you realize that we were in Connecticut and went to Skull and Bones for the first time ever on 3-2-2 which is their high holy number and they also conduct some of their most bizarre rituals reportedly on 3-2-2 so imagine we show up there literally on a lark realizing that the tomb is down the road and it's on the day of their high holy day you see there's a power in the universe
[00:18:30.362 --> 00:18:32.324]  Bigger than the globalist, bigger than the satanist.
[00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:33.524]  It's called God.
[00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:35.126]  And it's real.
[00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:37.768]  They want to play God, but they're not God.
[00:18:38.528 --> 00:18:46.694]  If you want to see our censored films on my infiltration of Bohemian Grove 21 years ago, it's called Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:18:47.035 --> 00:18:48.396]  It's absolutely free.
[00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:56.076]   at Band.Video in the InfoWars Films section, along with an updated film with even more footage
[00:18:56.076 --> 00:19:00.076]  and a new infiltration five years later in 2005.
[00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:04.454]  That film is titled The Order of Death.
[00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:10.994]   Find both films for free at Band.Video and share them because knowledge is power.
[00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:13.755]  (dramatic music)
[00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:37.935]   I wanna encourage listeners and I wanna encourage viewers to do something about the globalist takeover.
[00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:46.453]  And there's no other place out there that is really developing a plan to block the globalists and to expose their operations completely.
[00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:50.457]  That is doing it at any level similar to Infowars.
[00:19:50.517 --> 00:19:58.784]  But the enemy knows that Infowars, nine times out of ten, is the genesis point of major resistance movements that are devastating the New World Order's operations.
[00:19:58.924 --> 00:20:00.065]  But let me just tell you this.
[00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:03.808]  Do not sit there and expect Infowars to be here forever.
[00:20:03.848 --> 00:20:08.451]  And this operation has a giant globalist squid attached to us.
[00:20:09.472 --> 00:20:11.154]  Gnawing on our face, okay?
[00:20:11.414 --> 00:20:13.676]  I'm laying eggs real fast escape pods too.
[00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:18.700]  We'll just see how they do getting caught in the whole underwater jet stream here and what they'll grow into and what they'll do.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:25.065]  So I need energy to be able to make sure that all those things that we're ensuring in the future continue on because that's the main mission.
[00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:32.650]  I give you my word that I will be as focused and hardcore as I can until the very end, but I need financial support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.851]  We have products you already need.
[00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:34.691]  So don't wait.
[00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:35.492]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:20:35.351 --> 00:20:38.531]  get them today. We have Prostegard selling out soon. Dr.
[00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:42.150]   Jones Naturals toothpaste activated charcoal. It's amazing. Selling out

[00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.791]  hand sanitizers.
[00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:58.311]   Those are all 50% off. Also anybody that spends $75 or more in the store will get
[00:20:58.311 --> 00:21:03.190]   a free gift worth $10 or more as well and there's free shipping again on that.
[00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.710]   Infowarsstore.com or AAA 253-3139. But what's the new part of the sale?
[00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.030]   Because some things are selling out or off the list we are adding four things
[00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.710]  that are very close to selling out.
[00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:18.237]  The original, best-selling, deep-earth crystal, highest quality, good halogen iodine you're going to find.
[00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:22.361]  You have to get a DEA license to even get this, to be able to manufacture it, until it's put in this state.
[00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:24.282]  It's not under DEA control because it's a precursor.
[00:21:24.643 --> 00:21:29.406]  Obviously, a lot of things, it's so essential to the entire body, so essential to so many chemical things in the body and in nature.
[00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:30.787]  It's that magic.
[00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:33.409]  It's 50% off X3 as the deep-earth crystal.
[00:21:33.429 --> 00:21:34.831]  Two other types that are also healthy.
[00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:36.492]  Some people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[00:21:36.572 --> 00:21:40.795]  Most people cannot absorb the other types of iodine, but X3 is for folks that want something different.
[00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:41.956]  It's a different structure for folks.
[00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:42.416]  Try it out.
