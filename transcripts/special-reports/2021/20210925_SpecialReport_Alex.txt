[00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:01.176]  This is only the beginning.
[00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:02.503]  They've been putting people...
[00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.051]  On incitement charges for a year.
[00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:09.633]  So this has been their tactic to actually silence people who have a platform.
[00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:12.014]  So you would have heard of Craig Kelly as well.
[00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:14.795]  He's a political member of Parliament.
[00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:16.076]  He was taken off Facebook.
[00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.697]  He gets slammed in the media all the time.
[00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.018]  So this is just the beginning.
[00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:27.541]  They're trying to obviously stop people from speaking out of fear that they will get treated really badly from the media and so forth.
[00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:31.663]  And then of course with the protests as the days went on, the police got more and more brutal.
[00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:34.161]  seemingly to try and scare people.
[00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:38.423]   So this is just the beginning and tyrants don't negotiate, they just get harder.
[00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:41.222]  So it is going to get harder, this is not the end at all.
[00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:46.622]   So anything America can do would be absolutely fantastic because I don't know, maybe some
[00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:49.082]  people are going to have to die for this.
[00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.263]  It's getting really serious here.
[00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:55.442]   The protesting is very violent and it's not coming from the people, it's coming from the
[00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:59.603]  police but the people have to defend themselves as well.
[00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.289]  So it's a very difficult situation here.
[00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.496]  And I would love to be able to stop that from happening, escalating into actual death and things like that.
[00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:11.498]  But it's heading that way, unfortunately.
[00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:12.919]  But I don't want it to.
[00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.102]  So if America can do something to help us, that would be fantastic.
[00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.767]  Now our Prime Minister, the Honourable Scott Morrison, says that freedom is worth fighting for.
[00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:24.069]  But he was talking about freedom in Afghanistan.
[00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:26.223]  He wasn't talking about freedom in Australia.
[00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:38.087]  Scott Morrison thinks it's okay to fight for freedom overseas, but he doesn't see that the people in Sydney, the people in Melbourne, they need protection from the tyranny, from the police.
[00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:40.988]  It's completely out of control what's happening here.
[00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:43.389]  And I can't repeat myself enough.
[00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.189]  We need support.
[00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.090]  We need an SOS.
[00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.071]  Now, we're not asking for America to send troops or invade us or other countries to invade us.
[00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:54.755]   Let's try political Let's try to put pressure.
[00:01:55.056 --> 00:02:00.900]  I really like the idea, Alex, it was your idea, it wasn't my idea, let's get that on the record, just in case.
[00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:15.072]  I love your idea and if that happens, if you're going to go to the embassy and there's going to be other Americans that are able to apply, you know, democratic pressure or political pressure or in the UN and so forth, it's about time Australia gets criticized.
[00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:20.977]  You know, Australia was always the first to point the finger at Syria or Libya or China or Russia.
[00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:25.706]  You know, they're always the first to point the finger at Vladimir Putin and say, oh, look what he's doing over there.
[00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:31.080]  Well, unfortunately, Australia has now forever lost the moral high ground.
[00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:37.999]  What they really want to do is break our soul and break our minds, break our will, because then we're very easy to control.
[00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.640]  You know, it's like with the vaccine.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:51.806]  If you don't want to take it, but you take it to go to cafes or to appease your government or to keep your job, you lose a little bit of your soul every single time you do something that you know is against your conviction, basically.
[00:02:51.886 --> 00:03:03.233]   So every single method, every single thing that these premiers are doing are really designed to break our soul, just like an animal or a dog or Like, you know, how they train elephants in those tourist countries.
[00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:04.994]  It's all just psychological.
[00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:15.683]  So for me and what I realized in prison and what I did with, you know, utilizing my courage of conviction is it actually beat them in that moment.
[00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:21.367]  They tried to silence me and instead of silencing me, they actually made my voice international and bigger.
[00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:23.289]  So it actually did the exact opposite.
[00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:32.296]   So what I realized in prison, Alex, is one of the biggest thing I realized is that collective courage of conviction is going to be the only
[00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:36.097]  way that the world is going to beat the agenda.
[00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:39.154]  Now, obviously, you've said the agenda is in full swing.
[00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:40.354]  It has been for decades.
[00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:50.521]  And we are definitely behind the eight ball because we were all enjoying our lives and families and communities and not thinking that this would happen in our lifetime and maybe a next generation would have to deal with it.
[00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:51.421]  But here it is.
[00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.623]  It's not our fault that it's here, but it is our fault to do something about it.
[00:03:54.983 --> 00:04:02.808]  And the only way that we can is to have our own individual courage of conviction in our own states in life, in our own lifestyles, with our own abilities.
[00:04:02.748 --> 00:04:04.108]  everyone can do more.
[00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:13.107]  [Music]
[00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.107]  [Music]
[00:04:15.107 --> 00:04:19.107]  It's Saturday, September 25th, 2021.
[00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:27.470]  We're about to interview political prisoners live from Australia as we witness the Great Reset expand worldwide.
[00:04:31.352 --> 00:04:35.975]  Ladies and gentlemen of Australia, my name is Ricardo Bozzi and I am the National Leader of Australia One.
[00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:44.240]  In the coming days, weeks and months, disturbing rumours concerning the governance of our country will begin to circulate.
[00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:55.485]  These rumors will appear to be so incredible, so unlikely, and even so ludicrous, that the only sensible response would appear to be to dismiss them out of hand.
[00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.106]  Some of these rumors will, in time, indeed prove to be false.
[00:05:01.187 --> 00:05:16.107]   Unfortunately, some will be true, and be prima facie evidence of the despicable crimes of treason and sedition And some even morally worse by those at the highest levels of power in Australia.
[00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:35.814]  During this time, it is imperative you monitor closely the responses of those who comprise the polity, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, the military, the constabulary, the corporations, the media, academia and religious organizations.
[00:05:37.768 --> 00:05:42.670]  The case can already be made that many of these people are already a tainted of treason.
[00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:51.694]  But if any remain silent, in the face of an obvious attack on Australian sovereignty, they will have signed their own death warrants.
[00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:53.495]  Remember them.
[00:05:54.655 --> 00:06:16.251]   From the Governor General and State Governors, through Parliament, through all the courts including the High Court, Through the public service, the defence force, the police forces, the boardrooms, the unions, the charities, the mainstream media, schools and universities and finally, even the churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and lodges.
[00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:20.192]  Remember their names and who they are.
[00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:23.673]  Remember what they said and what they did not say.
[00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:27.514]  Remember what they did and what they did not do.
[00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:30.863]  Why and how has it come to this?
[00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:36.385]  Simply put, for decades now, we have been deceived by those whom we trusted.
[00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:43.846]  Slowly, the truth has been revealed by the tireless efforts of a few, and this has been a most difficult task.
[00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:50.368]  Some of you will have heard it said, sometimes you can't tell people, you just have to show them.
[00:06:51.388 --> 00:06:56.569]  And to put that in the Australian vernacular, some people just need to piss on the electric fence for themselves.
[00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:00.548]  Thankfully, enough of us are now awake to the lies.
[00:07:01.308 --> 00:07:02.748]  And our numbers continue to grow.
[00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:05.849]  Faster every day.
[00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:07.949]  So what should we do?
[00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:10.149]  Firstly, be calm.
[00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.110]  Know that we can and will win this war.
[00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.031]  Secondly, be united.
[00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:22.652]  No matter how many they send against us, they cannot defeat 25 million Australians who stand together as one.
[00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:32.734]  And simply say, in a clear, strong and unconquerable voice, no consent, no consent, no consent.
[00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:35.775]  Thirdly, be brave.
[00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:40.037]  Some of us might be hurt, and some of us might die.
[00:07:41.497 --> 00:07:45.939]  But if we truly seek liberty, we must win it for ourselves.
[00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.020]  Nothing worth winning is won cheaply.
[00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:51.981]  Fourthly, be good.
[00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:56.646]  We the people must win this war with non-violent, non-cooperation.
[00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:03.771]  Because the manner of our victory is of foundational importance to the future of Australia as a nation state.
[00:08:05.112 --> 00:08:10.576]  We must win this war with such moral authority that we are able to win the peace that follows.
[00:08:11.937 --> 00:08:15.640]  Finally, when all is done, the guilty will be punished.
[00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:27.915]   We will deal with the traitors in a lawful manner, Which after the reprehensible, coordinated malfeasance and violence that they have visited upon us, that would be more than they deserve.
[00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:37.058]  And we will do this because we, the common people of Australia, are and have always been so much more than the elites.
[00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.679]  We are better than they are.
[00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:46.881]  We have not and we will not sacrifice our decency and our humanity to win this war as they have done.
[00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:52.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to enter a period of history without precedent.
[00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:54.489]  A war for the world.
[00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.511]  And we, you and I, are on the front line.
[00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.331]  Be calm.
[00:09:01.412 --> 00:09:02.072]  Be united.
[00:09:02.092 --> 00:09:03.913]  Be brave.
[00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:05.693]  And be good.
[00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:16.538]  And finally, remember that we fight, as GK Chesterton wrote, not because we hate what is in front of us, but because we love what is behind us.
[00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:17.678]  Thank you.
[00:09:20.182 --> 00:09:23.945]  Thank you so much for joining us on this very special Saturday transmission.
[00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:28.208]  I want to thank the crew for coming in and burning the candle at both ends.
[00:09:28.228 --> 00:09:35.414]  I have a very important message to the viewers and listeners just on the fight between good and evil here in a moment.
[00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:41.759]  And then I'm going to lay out the just quickening that is accelerating right in front of us.
[00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:46.742]  We have total proof that Trump won in Arizona.
[00:09:47.944 --> 00:10:00.042]  He got at least six times the votes he needed to be reversed to prove that he won Arizona, a state that even mainline polls had going for Trump.
[00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:03.823]  And, of course, the state he carried four years previous.
[00:10:04.523 --> 00:10:06.223]  We will go over that first.
[00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:08.064]  It is amazing.
[00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:10.065]  Gateway Planet is doing a great job covering it.
[00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:11.785]  So is InfoWars.
[00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:15.006]  We have all the key articles up there to show you the proof.
[00:10:15.486 --> 00:10:17.687]  We're going to be going over that stack first.
[00:10:17.927 --> 00:10:18.147]  Then...
[00:10:20.456 --> 00:10:20.676]  U.N.
[00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:31.562]  planning permanent lockdown warns Mark Moreno, former top advisor to the Republican Senate, the leading expert next to Ward Monckton on the globalist takeover that has now been publicly announced.
[00:10:32.003 --> 00:10:36.625]  He laid out all the documents on my show yesterday, and I even learned some things I didn't know about the rollout.
[00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:38.226]  It is now here, not coming.
[00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:50.613]   We're going to tie that into the whole COVID tyranny and how that's unfolding and how it ties in with all these articles like the one in the Wall Street Journal saying, looking forward, To the end of humanity.
[00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:52.414]  So that's coming up.
[00:10:52.514 --> 00:10:57.616]  Second, all the amazing developments that are taking place with the COVID tyranny.
[00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:07.619]  Then the economic crisis that's causing Costco limits, toilet paper, paper towels, and bottled water to create hysteria and a run on products again.
[00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:18.642]  But again, the last COVID lockdown has already caused massive problems and shortages across the board and commodities to be exploding in price along with all the inflation.
[00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:27.185]  Then we have Mainline News admitting that Xi Jinping has broken with the New World Order.
[00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:28.185]  And this is a real break.
[00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.466]  It is not a staged break.
[00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:32.727]  And it's going to have serious ramifications.
[00:11:32.747 --> 00:11:33.608]  We're going to lay that out.
[00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:44.422]   Continuing, the New York Times admits what I told you on January 6 from a rooftop above the disaster that stopped us from getting our 10-day
[00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:47.842]   investigation, the Senate was set to vote for that would have proven the
[00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:53.862]   fraud that's now been proven in Arizona and Georgia. And what Tucker Carlson said a few
[00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:58.903]   months later, and has done a great job laying out, is all proven and we are vindicated. The
[00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:04.132]   New York Times admits that the FBI basically infiltrated and was leading much of the
[00:12:04.132 --> 00:12:09.813]   assault on the Capitol that day, then had the higher-ups order the police to stand down,
[00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:15.192]   open the doors, wave people in, so they could have a large portion of people to be indicted.
[00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:19.413]   Some already in jail, in solitary confinement for eight months while being non-violent. One
[00:12:19.413 --> 00:12:24.222]   man has already been in jail for eight months and he now faces
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:33.130]  He just pled guilty six months in jail on top of the time he's sentenced to solitary confinement for drinking Pelosi's beer on her desk.
[00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:38.417]  Yes, he wasn't part of Black Lives Matter or some Antifa group burning down a police station.
[00:12:38.437 --> 00:12:40.760]  Then he would have been bailed out by Kamala Harris.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.822]  Yes, that really happened.
[00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:50.777]  And then we have the answer to this, standing up to the globalists everywhere they are, shouting them down from the rooftops and not complying with their illegal orders.
[00:12:51.197 --> 00:12:52.058]  You're a war criminal.
[00:12:52.098 --> 00:12:52.738]  You're a criminal.
[00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:58.702]  Hillary Clinton heckled by protesters in Ireland while she was wearing a queen outfit.
[00:12:59.483 --> 00:13:08.509]  And I'm going to tie that into the whole globalist system, just being a new reboot of the old British empire worldwide with the eugenics in-game goal.
[00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.134]  Again, I'm not attacking the British people themselves.
[00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:16.476]  The British people are very strong, very militaristic, and very smart.
[00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:33.345]  And so the globalists went there going back really 800 years ago, but the British Empire became dominant after 1815 at the Battle of Runnymede when the Rothschilds were able to crash the British stock market and take over the British Empire.
[00:13:33.384 --> 00:13:38.384]   So it's been that combine we've been facing ever since and it's extremely serious.
[00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:43.184]   And even mainline history books, even mainline financial publications admit that is the
[00:13:43.184 --> 00:13:49.184]   skeletal structure of world government we live under today, the corporate fascist world government using communism and
[00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:55.494]   socialism to control the lower stratus is the remains of the British Empire merged with the new
[00:13:55.494 --> 00:14:01.784]   corporate globalist empire using all the same tactics and even having the same titles
[00:14:01.784 --> 00:14:04.104]  and political and legal systems.
[00:14:04.088 --> 00:14:06.488]  So that's all coming up today as well.
[00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:14.570]  And where the economy is going, if they're able to launch another global lockdown, which has already begun in Africa, Latin America, many areas of the Middle East and Asia.
[00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.290]  And that's why the supply chain has broken down so badly.
[00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.831]  And now our economy is spiraling downwards as well.
[00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:24.058]  And then joining us coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:48.936]  We are going to be joined by Simon Boykov, who is a very active, well-spoken activist who has been showing people the checkpoints and the police violence and really the North Korea type activities being carried out across Australia, but particularly in Southern Australia, New South Wales and other areas.
[00:14:49.477 --> 00:15:03.901]   He's got a lot to tell us joining us and he put us in contact with Monica Schmidt, Who's been all over the news, and we've covered her here, arrested for organizing peaceful demonstrations and thrown in solitary confinement for six months.
[00:15:04.702 --> 00:15:06.404]  Remember the footage of them arresting her at her home?
[00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:14.431]  Well, the Supreme Court of Australia just ordered her released on bail while she awaits trial for her thought crimes.
[00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:17.394]  So she'll be joining us coming up.
[00:15:18.598 --> 00:15:20.680]  In about 30-40 minutes as well.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.342]  So, look for all that.
[00:15:22.662 --> 00:15:25.125]  We really appreciate them being up in the middle of the night.
[00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:27.327]  Depending on the time zone, it is 1 to 3 a.m.
[00:15:29.994 --> 00:15:37.080]  Right now in Australia, and then this will re-air later, obviously, when it's in the morning and daytime for them over there.
[00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:42.586]  I guess we're going to re-loop this and we're also, until I go live tomorrow evening, Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:44.147]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:15:44.227 --> 00:15:47.470]  Eastern, that would be 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.391]  Pacific, 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:48.731]  Mountain.
[00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:50.813]  But this is really a global broadcast.
[00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:58.425]   We're not a standard radio show or TV show that's Hitting our target audience with target advertisers, selling them what is sold locally.
[00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:02.948]  We do fund ourselves advertising, but our main mission is to reach people worldwide.
[00:16:02.968 --> 00:16:14.555]  That's why we pay for satellites and shortwave and the cost of millions of dollars a year total that goes into Africa, goes into Asia, goes into Eastern Europe, goes into Russia and goes into Latin America.
[00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:18.366]  And if we do not get more support, I'm not complaining.
[00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:19.807]  It's just the way it is.
[00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:23.609]  Early next year, I'm going to have to cut the WWCR off six hours a day.
[00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:25.950]  Global shortwave service to the entire world.
[00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.452]  Millions listen, but almost no funds come in from it.
[00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:33.655]  And also the satellite systems covering about 4 billion people.
[00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:37.277]  We're even trying to get a satellite beam into Australia, but it just costs too much.
[00:16:38.218 --> 00:16:39.979]  And so we'll have to cease those systems.
[00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.561]  We'll still be hitting North America.
[00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:48.126]  It's just a very, very rough time for everybody, obviously, as we go into this globally engineered depression to bring us to our knees.
[00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:50.447]  But that's the type of things I'll cut before I cut crew.
[00:16:50.828 --> 00:16:53.170]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:06.571]  Don't absorb as much vitamin D in the sun.

[00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:12.613]  It's the highest quality you're going to find at a very low price at 50% off.

[00:17:26.596 --> 00:17:27.676]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:34.018]  I want to thank you all for keeping this service to liberty and this defense against tyranny on the air.
[00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:38.028]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:42.391]  So I'm going to cover the election news, the UN news.
[00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:47.614]  We'll get to more next hour, but I'm going to mention it because this is all UN World Government corporate takeover.
[00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:48.495]  That's what COVID is.
[00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:49.295]  They admit it now.
[00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:51.217]  It's public in their own documents.
[00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.738]  They said they would launch it 11 years ago.
[00:17:54.139 --> 00:18:00.343]  And the supply chain problems, China, that ties into COVID and the new world order and so much more today.
[00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:01.884]  So look for that.
[00:18:02.545 --> 00:18:11.819]   The first thing I want to say is These Saturday shows are very popular because there is a lot less media being put out on Saturday.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.283]  Normally the peak in media for news consumption is Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
[00:18:19.863 --> 00:18:23.665]  That's where you've got more news reporters, more things happening, really a glut of news.
[00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.726]  Everything is lost in the background chatter.
[00:18:26.726 --> 00:18:30.448]  Sunday has less than weekdays, but a lot more than Saturday.
[00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.011]  Uh, and, but there's a lot less media out there.
[00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:38.113]  So you actually have more viewers and more listeners in my experience with the new show on Sunday.
[00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:41.675]  That's why 15 years ago, I started doing a Sunday show four to 6 PM as well.
[00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:44.236]  Not just the weekday show I've been doing for 25 years.
[00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:46.337]  And it started on air 28 years ago.
[00:18:47.317 --> 00:18:51.379]  Um, so I thought people really want something that kind of condenses what happened in the week.
[00:18:52.045 --> 00:18:56.407]  All the top stories, the latest analysis was coming up in the new week on a Saturday.
[00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.008]  And we found that's, that's the case.
[00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:05.112]  Normally this Saturday show gets about a million views at Mandot video within just 24 hours.
[00:19:05.672 --> 00:19:07.533]  Not to mention everybody that grabs it and shares it.
[00:19:07.573 --> 00:19:10.835]  And then most of the time, hundreds of thousands, if not millions more people.
[00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:17.214]   So on average, this special Saturday bulletin we've been doing now since before the election
[00:19:17.214 --> 00:19:23.855]   took place, we've been doing it about 10 months now or longer, is very, very popular.
[00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:30.174]   Because again, there's almost no one doing original live transmissions on Saturday.
[00:19:30.174 --> 00:19:31.494]  And there's a big hunger for it.
[00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:33.174]  And so I want to thank all of you for what you're doing.
[00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:34.773]  But I want to explain something to viewers.
[00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:40.334]   When I say you're important, when I say you're the brains and the heart and the bones and the will of this
[00:19:40.334 --> 00:19:41.855]  thing, you are.
[00:19:41.855 --> 00:19:45.293]   When you get excited, when you share things, it changes the world.
[00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:50.973]   And so you're the reason that we're here, because you care and you're involved and you are the tip
[00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:55.734]   of the spear that's aware of this globalist, tyrannical takeover whose end game is not just
[00:19:55.734 --> 00:20:01.414]   to conquer us and run things, whose end game is to reduce our population by at least 90%
[00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:49.730]   And so you're the reason that we're here, because you care and you're involved
[00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.809]   and you are the tip of the spear that's aware of this globalist, tyrannical takeover,
[00:19:54.809 --> 00:20:00.509]   whose end game is not just to conquer us and run things, whose end game is to reduce our population
[00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:02.569]  by at least 90% and play God.
[00:20:02.569 --> 00:20:07.208]   That's a very, very satanic journey that we're on and we need to get off this train.
[00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:10.688]   So I wanna just read this letter to all of you to remind you of who you are.
[00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:15.889]   You are the man and woman in the arena, excerpt from the speech, "Citizenship in a Republic,"
[00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:20.750]  delivered in Paris, France, April 23rd, 1910.
[00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:27.510]  From our populist president that did take on what is the globalist today, but their predecessor, the robber barons.
[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:36.114]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:20:36.595 --> 00:20:40.037]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.
[00:20:40.737 --> 00:20:50.524]  Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[00:20:51.565 --> 00:21:07.097]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best, in the end, knows the triumph of high achievement.
[00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:20.051]  And who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:22.572]  And it's all true.
[00:21:22.632 --> 00:21:24.372]  Every word of this is pure Veritas.
[00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:26.313]  There is no success.
[00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:27.313]  There is no getting stronger.
[00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:33.694]  There's no getting better without conflict, without pain, without justifiable suffering.
[00:21:36.323 --> 00:22:03.755]   Who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls Who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:22:04.476 --> 00:22:05.116]  Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:22:05.777 --> 00:22:07.358]  And that is the yes men.
[00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:11.120]  That is who they are.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.402]  And that is who we don't want to be.
[00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:15.663]  They are the stagnant.
[00:22:15.743 --> 00:22:17.223]  They are the lapdogs.
[00:22:17.263 --> 00:22:21.066]  They are those that submit for a little bit of money and power and status.
[00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:29.591]  But when you see no one standing up for what's right, it allows pure evil to get into position of power, and by increment, bend everyone to their will.
[00:22:31.218 --> 00:22:33.119]  Oh, just don't say this.
[00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:34.900]  Don't have this free speech.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.782]  And a few years later, the UN is censoring senators when they speak on the Senate floor.
[00:22:41.782 --> 00:22:48.985]  And the UN is in Yahoo News saying, well, the young man did have a swollen heart, the hospital said from the shot, but he could have scared people.
[00:22:49.025 --> 00:22:50.326]  So we banned what he said.
[00:22:51.226 --> 00:22:53.947]  They're now saying, oh, he told the truth, but we don't want to scare you.
[00:22:55.268 --> 00:22:57.649]  So we banned him talking about what the vaccine did.
[00:22:57.949 --> 00:22:58.649]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:22:59.997 --> 00:23:01.859]  And that, my friends, is the journey to slavery.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.621]  And any fate but slavery.
[00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:06.302]  Any fate but submission.
[00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:06.903]  Any fate.
[00:23:09.645 --> 00:23:10.345]  Very important.
[00:23:11.526 --> 00:23:31.397]   Fourth hour yesterday with Jay Dyer, where he read from major philosophical Leaders of what became the modern satanic movement about how they deceive people thinking it's really a libertarian endeavor and about self-empowerment and freaking out Christians.
[00:23:31.837 --> 00:23:38.983]  But when you get into it, you find very quickly, it is not about being an atheist, teasing people that you're a satanist.
[00:23:39.503 --> 00:23:43.847]  It is about demonic energy seething through you.
[00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:49.792]  I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands, Albert Pike said.
[00:23:54.011 --> 00:24:00.654]  And the slaves of Satanism that dress up in black and try to act powerful, those are the outer court of Satanism.
[00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:01.415]  Those are the jokes.
[00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:03.196]  Those are not the Luciferians.
[00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:08.879]  I have felt the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.741]  I almost went to the dark side, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:16.402 --> 00:24:23.326]  Obviously, Satan is a very old entity and doesn't have omnipresence like God, but knows who's going to be a challenge and he tries to get them.
[00:24:24.284 --> 00:24:31.349]  And I have been tempted and I have never been involved in satanic rituals or killed animals or been part of hurting people.
[00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.813]  But I did get recruited into high level stuff via the sex when I was a teenager.
[00:24:37.554 --> 00:24:42.437]  And I guess you could say I'm a sexual abuse victim, but I did not feel like I was being victimized by these women.
[00:24:42.457 --> 00:24:44.639]  My God, it was quite enjoyable.
[00:24:45.439 --> 00:24:48.842]  But that is what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.563]  It's how they get most people to join it.
[00:24:51.584 --> 00:24:53.065]  And it's just like something out of a movie.
[00:24:54.281 --> 00:24:55.902]  Just like it's just like Eyes Wide Shut.
[00:24:56.903 --> 00:25:10.053]  So I've been taken to the big mansion where they're having the Eyes Wide Shut meeting and you think you're sneaking into it and you're not or you're being taken there and it's all rich people that are bored who are into this stuff at one level and another level they're deadly serious.
[00:25:11.114 --> 00:25:12.735]  Deadly serious.
[00:25:13.643 --> 00:25:15.845]  And they're given power by the God of this world for what they do.
[00:25:15.945 --> 00:25:19.348]  So anyone that denies this is a fool.
[00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:31.177]  So when you see those people with lazy eyes, and I'm not knocking people that have lazy eyes because the leader of the so-called Temple Satanist group that the media hypes is, you know, just a Democrat libertarian group.
[00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:40.906]   That guy might have a little understanding of what he's involved in, but all those pathetic nerds that are trying to be Edgy and stuff.
[00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:46.549]  They are really, really sad people thinking, Oh, I'm just an atheist that dresses up in Halloween outfits to go scare people.
[00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.691]  I will assure you that that is not what you're part of.
[00:25:50.731 --> 00:25:51.812]  And that is not what's going on.
[00:25:55.294 --> 00:26:06.357]   You know, I got started late today and our guests are in like five minutes are waiting for us in Australia and I'd wanted to do like an hour before we got them on.
[00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:07.918]  I don't want to make them wait 20, 30 minutes.
[00:26:07.938 --> 00:26:11.059]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit what happened with the election now.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.542]  And then I'm going to go to our guests that tie into everything because they're patient zero.
[00:26:17.582 --> 00:26:22.484]  They're, they're being swallowed by the pyro radical globalist system right now.
[00:26:23.404 --> 00:26:25.165]  We will talk to our guests from Australia.
[00:26:25.425 --> 00:26:26.825]  This is just amazing information.
[00:26:27.265 --> 00:26:28.506]  It's middle of the night over there.
[00:26:30.253 --> 00:26:30.953]  Very early morning.
[00:26:31.473 --> 00:26:34.914]  And then we are going to come back after they're gone.
[00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:40.495]  And I'm going to hit all this other, just over the top important news to understand where our world is and where it's going.
[00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:45.297]  I just want to say one more thing about good versus evil.
[00:26:45.897 --> 00:26:55.119]  The, the, the, the Jay Dyer, uh, report that's at band dot video talks about the satanic age, dawning the satanic age being here.
[00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:14.706]  And like any betrayal, like anything that's about weakness and, and, and, and failure and death, uh, it's, it's, it's going to be very, very tumultuous, very, very accelerated and, uh, very, very disgusting.
[00:27:16.427 --> 00:27:17.827]  And it's not going to last very long.
[00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:22.849]  It's like Hitler's a thousand year third Reich that would last a thousand years.
[00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:27.126]  These things always go up and smoke very, very quickly.
[00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:31.068]  And there's the headline, the coming satanic age is here.
[00:27:32.328 --> 00:27:32.888]  It's got 137,000 views.
[00:27:32.968 --> 00:27:35.469]  It needs 10 million views.
[00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:38.310]  I mean, you really, he reads from the books by them.
[00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:50.375]  And I later read these books, but I, uh, up in Dallas, Rockwell, Texas, richest County in Texas at the time got, you know, roped in and, um, let's just say this.
[00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:54.702]  Most people get roped into stuff like this.
[00:27:54.722 --> 00:27:56.364]  They never, they never get out of it.
[00:27:56.724 --> 00:27:57.724]  I was never really in it.
[00:27:58.165 --> 00:28:03.208]  I was circling, circling the black hole.
[00:28:04.008 --> 00:28:07.090]  And I think that was all God too, allowing that to happen and just all of this.
[00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.052]  So I would, my medal would be tested.
[00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:11.753]  It was just one more of those tests throughout life.
[00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:14.395]  And so all glory goes to God, the great plan.
[00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:20.339]  And I am just beyond blessed to have escaped the last vestiges of that.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:28.763]  Just recently, because it's something that scars and taints and I guess the word would be stains your soul.
[00:28:29.883 --> 00:28:35.466]  And now I have gone further with the Holy Spirit than I could ever even imagine.
[00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:40.908]  And I've been taken, I mean, I've seen heaven and I've experienced it.
[00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:41.648]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:42.308 --> 00:28:45.550]  The feeling of absolute, total completion.
[00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.031]  It's not like ecstasy or pleasure.
[00:28:48.491 --> 00:28:49.531]  It's beyond that.
[00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.012]  It's just like, oh, oh my.
[00:28:51.428 --> 00:28:52.508]  This is eternity.
[00:28:52.548 --> 00:28:56.609]  This is absolute beyond what you can imagine as nirvana.
[00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:04.531]  Completeness, oneness, but you still have your soul, your mind, your separateness, and you can do whatever you want.
[00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:06.452]  Look into anything, know anything.
[00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:26.173]   You can stare into all these failed cultures and civilizations and species, or those that fail to those species that create their own Tombs, their own sealed containers that they have decided to wall themselves off from God.
[00:29:26.193 --> 00:29:30.615]  And, and, and, and, and that's their own personal hell they've made.
[00:29:32.236 --> 00:29:44.483]  And that's something that the Satanist will never, they'll feel the surge of, of, of rising power and, and, and, and the, the will to take over and, and, and the beauty of your destiny and it's all yours.
[00:29:44.503 --> 00:29:45.924]  It's a joke.
[00:29:47.025 --> 00:29:50.230]   It, it, it, it, It's not one trillion times weaker.
[00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.071]  It's not even of the same order.
[00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:56.414]  It's not even infinity times weak.
[00:29:57.215 --> 00:30:00.617]  It's, there's no total completion.
[00:30:01.438 --> 00:30:01.918]  Absolutely.
[00:30:01.938 --> 00:30:05.080]  Just imagine just, you're not even thinking, Oh, this is completion.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.142]  You're not even thinking, Oh my God, this is total pleasure.
[00:30:07.162 --> 00:30:10.825]  Just like, Whoa, I am timeless.
[00:30:11.005 --> 00:30:11.205]  I am.
[00:30:13.473 --> 00:30:14.794]  From the beginning of time to end of time.
[00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:16.354]  I am Alpha Omega, the beginning and the end.
[00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:17.115]  I am with God.
[00:30:17.575 --> 00:30:18.715]  I am now with God.
[00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:20.616]  I am now in God's bosom.
[00:30:24.478 --> 00:30:25.078]  It's amazing.
[00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:26.999]  Woo!
[00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:31.121]  And all I want is my family and my children and you to be there with me.
[00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:32.241]  And we're going to be there together.
[00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:37.564]  So I look at these poor, pathetic blobs, and I don't say that because they're fat.
[00:30:37.584 --> 00:30:38.304]  We all got our problems.
[00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:55.073]  But they're all like a bunch of fat nerds and you know, they're devil horns and they're all being controlled by people that want to hurt them and, and, and to hate them and see them as total fools who are coming to them for enlightenment and empowerment and are going to be given betrayal and failure.
[00:30:57.554 --> 00:30:59.814]  Serving evil always destroys you in the end.
[00:30:59.954 --> 00:31:00.654]  And that's a fact.
[00:31:01.134 --> 00:31:02.095]  It's the very nature of it.
[00:31:02.155 --> 00:31:07.596]  God gives us endless generations of life experiencing each other in this dimension.
[00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:12.989]  And then all of the higher dimensions and all the multiple levels of our lives.
[00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:37.421]  It's so much more powerful than even their so-called modern science could explain, but it's all in the science that we are a composite of all our ancestors, our earth suit is, so that we are a toolkit of everybody that came before us in this test, there for us to learn and pass that on and traits of who they were and what they stood for.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.901]  And what they went through.
[00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:42.243]  And so the scars create the tapestry that's so beautiful.
[00:31:42.524 --> 00:31:44.045]  The imperfection creates the perfection.
[00:31:44.866 --> 00:32:01.154]   And then dimensionally, we have that soul that's so old that has been put here to experience that, which will then continue to commune with the other spirits that God created and gave free will that then ascend into other higher realms of testing.
[00:32:01.454 --> 00:32:04.076]  I can tell you that this is not the one test.
[00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.197]  And that's, I've seen it.
[00:32:06.378 --> 00:32:15.424]  So there's more and it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very intense, but there's this an expansion going on and it's very special to be part of it.
[00:32:16.004 --> 00:32:22.009]  And we should all just thank God that we were created by God through his will, through God's will.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:32.629]  And I just want to align with God and that is my one goal is to align with God and to come as close to God as I possibly can.
[00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:48.342]   And I just thank God for the test and the consciousness And the love God had to have to create creatures that he loves so much, and then to put us into this test when God loves us more than we could ever love our children.
[00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:50.003]  Imagine how much you love your children.
[00:32:50.483 --> 00:32:55.166]  God, again, loves a sparrow in the field, as the Bible says, more than we love our children.
[00:32:55.486 --> 00:32:56.406]  God loves a worm.
[00:32:56.466 --> 00:32:57.547]  God loves a bacteria.
[00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:01.649]  Infinity more than Satan hates you.
[00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.912]  Satan wants to kill you because Satan failed the test.
[00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:08.832]  Satan decided to not be one.
[00:33:08.852 --> 00:33:11.733]  He wants to make us one with that.
[00:33:13.274 --> 00:33:14.134]  One with the failure.
[00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:15.034]  One with the betrayal.
[00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:16.374]  One with the ugliness.
[00:33:17.275 --> 00:33:18.115]  One with the despair.
[00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:21.556]  One with the darkness.
[00:33:22.136 --> 00:33:23.496]  Living alone in the dark.
[00:33:23.536 --> 00:33:24.096]  That's Satan.
[00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:25.797]  Wants to drag us into that pit.
[00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:26.817]  With him.
[00:33:27.997 --> 00:33:28.237]  With it.
[00:33:29.817 --> 00:33:30.317]  Okay.
[00:33:30.317 --> 00:33:39.656]   Let me just tell you this, Jamie White's article is incredible.
[00:33:39.874 --> 00:33:42.336]  Let me just read the synopsis of what was found.
[00:33:42.876 --> 00:33:44.177]  Trump did win Arizona.
[00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:50.360]  The first one they called early to go, whoa, even the state was supposed to win, to just put everybody off balance.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:58.445]  They were supposed to be able to steal Texas and Florida, but didn't have enough of the people that were dead or still off the voter rolls they put back on to do that.
[00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:00.746]  And it's all right here.
[00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:06.449]  This is what was found by real forensic audit, all put up, all shown, all documented with all the scans.
[00:34:07.293 --> 00:34:07.794]  For the public.
[00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:12.403]  Canvas showed 3,400 more ballots were cast than recorded.
[00:34:13.425 --> 00:34:19.397]  Over 9,000 more mail-in ballots were received and recorded than the official number of mail-in ballots sent out by the county.
[00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:23.152]  Uh, so you've got over 100% voting with 9,000.
[00:34:23.392 --> 00:34:25.414]  That means total fraud, probably 20%.
[00:34:25.634 --> 00:34:34.183]  Precedents show more ballots, precincts show more ballots cast on election day than people who showed up to vote.
[00:34:34.563 --> 00:34:35.865]  1,501 extra votes.
[00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:42.572]  Approximately 2,500 ballots were shown in the early vote returns that do not have voter listed as casting them.
[00:34:43.777 --> 00:34:45.378]  This was all allowed to go through by the Democrats.
[00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:46.920]  They tried to suppress all this.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.340]  No wonder.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.224]  Over 2,555 early votes show in the county final vote file.
[00:34:53.745 --> 00:34:57.528]  You don't have a corresponding entry in the early voting returns file.
[00:34:57.628 --> 00:34:58.408]  That's the biggin'.
[00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:05.234]  Over 23,000 votes by mail after moving after the October 5th cutoff.
[00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:07.475]  2,382 votes cast.
[00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:11.539]  Votes in Maricopa County in person after moving out of the county.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:20.587]  Over 2,000 votes were moved out of Arizona during the 29 days before the elections were given a full ballot instead of a presidential only ballot.
[00:35:21.348 --> 00:35:24.811]  Close to 300 deceased voters potentially voted.
[00:35:25.712 --> 00:35:29.335]  There is an unprecedented number of discrepancies in the vote total.
[00:35:29.755 --> 00:35:31.557]  This is just one county they did, folks.
[00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:37.402]  This could only happen through malicious actions or severe incompetence from Aricopa County officials.
[00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.351]  And it goes on.
[00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:44.214]  Remember, Trump lost by only 10,500 votes.
[00:35:45.214 --> 00:35:49.958]  And the 17,000 duplicates are more than 1.5 times the total of Joe Biden's alleged victory.
[00:35:50.218 --> 00:35:54.001]  And of course, almost all the duplicates go to Joe Biden, which is more evidence of fraud.
[00:35:54.322 --> 00:35:59.746]  That's just one thing I've got in the election fraud stack that we are going to be hitting.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.403]  All right, we're going to air a special report and come back with a few minutes with our first guest.
[00:36:04.443 --> 00:36:07.986]  We've got another amazing lady who I just admire.
[00:36:08.026 --> 00:36:08.827]  I admire both these people.
[00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:09.567]  Monica Schmidt.
[00:36:10.388 --> 00:36:12.410]  Simon Boykov is going to be on with us.
[00:36:13.211 --> 00:36:20.497]  And we'll roll some B-roll of all the amazing things he does driving up to checkpoints in small towns, trying to have him arrested for simply driving around without his mask on in his car.
[00:36:21.397 --> 00:36:22.578]  But that was months ago.
[00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:23.459]  It's far worse now.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.382]  And so we're going to be joined by Monica Schmidt, who has spent six months in jail.
[00:36:28.143 --> 00:36:29.864]  We're going out and having a peaceful demonstration.
[00:36:30.224 --> 00:36:34.226]  She's out on bail because the Supreme Court said what they were doing was North Korean.
[00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:39.388]  Well, I mean, the whole thing is just a giant disaster, but it's a beta test for the rest of the world.
[00:36:39.468 --> 00:36:44.871]  So these are literal wartime correspondents in the globalist takeover of Australia.
[00:36:45.732 --> 00:36:46.532]  So that's coming up.
[00:36:48.305 --> 00:36:54.307]  And then when we end this show today, I'm going to play the Jay Dyer report from yesterday without any of the commercials.
[00:36:54.867 --> 00:36:57.087]  The coming satanic age is here, so that's coming up.
[00:36:57.468 --> 00:36:59.248]  We've got Hillary heckled in Ireland.
[00:36:59.648 --> 00:37:00.448]  Very, very important.
[00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:02.129]  We've got so much more.
[00:37:02.149 --> 00:37:04.129]  We've got videos of the election fraud.
[00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.450]  It's all coming up.
[00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.271]  We're going to go to break, though, and come back with the tyranny.
[00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:13.312]  This tyranny is just the beginning from John Bound and Bandon Video.
[00:37:14.318 --> 00:37:22.960]  Joe Biden's rambling misspoken speech at the United Nations was as transparent as it was a veiled message to the international order.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:31.401]  And global health threat, and a global health threat council, council toward global COVID response, the global COVID response.
[00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:38.482]  Vaccinating the world, working with countries, technologies that reduce the risk.
[00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:41.583]  Similarly, we know the bitter string of terrorism.
[00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.812]  The bitter sting of terrorism is real.
[00:37:44.992 --> 00:37:46.734]  Heroic, horrific violence.
[00:37:46.715 --> 00:37:48.715]  climactic climate change.
[00:37:48.715 --> 00:37:54.355]   Ignoring his hand in the murder of 13 U.S. soldiers and an aid worker's family and the
[00:37:54.355 --> 00:38:00.195]   impending doom of replacement migration while betraying our oldest ally, France.
[00:38:00.168 --> 00:38:02.370]  Emmanuel Macron is officially fuming.
[00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.231]  He's, you know, he's not attending this U.N.
[00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:12.236]  summit, and we don't really know what the state of affairs is, even though they're sort of set to have some talk with Biden in the next few days.
[00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:17.499]  Biden's poorly coded message predicted more pandemics to control the population.
[00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:27.625]  Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere, and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic?
[00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.550]  Or there will be another one.
[00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.571]  And signaled that the global carbon tax system is imminent.
[00:38:33.951 --> 00:38:43.654]  Will we meet the threat of challenging climate, the challenging climate we're all feeling, already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather?
[00:38:45.014 --> 00:39:05.335]   Or will we suffer the merciless march of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves, The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a code red for humanity.
[00:39:06.415 --> 00:39:09.818]  We see the warning signs in every continent and region.
[00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:12.120]  Scorching temperatures.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.301]  Shocking biodiversity loss.
[00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.754]  Polluted air, water and natural spaces.
[00:39:18.794 --> 00:39:21.634]  And climate-related disasters at every turn.
[00:39:21.915 --> 00:39:32.777]  The climate change rhetoric will accelerate piggybacking on the COVID lockdowns as climate change hysteria will saturate the remainder of the Biden administration occupation.
[00:39:33.117 --> 00:39:36.578]  The climate crisis is not our fight alone, it's a global fight.
[00:39:36.943 --> 00:39:45.990]  The President believes that what's in the infrastructure package is an important down payment on addressing what he sees as a crisis in our climate.
[00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:52.395]  Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here.
[00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:54.577]  It's not going to get any better.
[00:39:55.177 --> 00:39:56.619]  Well, let me tell you why that won't happen.
[00:39:56.439 --> 00:40:01.679]   for example, say, well, you know, history tells us that he can make all the promises
[00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:05.618]   he wants for 2030, there's a good chance the Republicans will be back in power by then
[00:40:05.618 --> 00:40:06.618]  and change everything.
[00:40:06.618 --> 00:40:08.599]  Well, let me tell you why that won't happen.
[00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:14.859]   Because the major corporations of the world, including in the United States, are all moving
[00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:15.719]  in this direction.
[00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:21.324]  And no politician is going to turn them around once they've committed trillions of dollars to this endeavor.
[00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:23.084]  That's just not going to happen.
[00:40:23.124 --> 00:40:36.848]  The normalization of contact tracing via COVID-19 apps and the expansion of the IRS and its reach into everyone's bank account will ensure the implementation of a similar carbon credit tracking system.
[00:40:37.108 --> 00:40:41.271]  It will be known as a PCA, a personal carbon allowance.
[00:40:41.692 --> 00:40:50.298]  As a proposal was presented in the science journal Nature by four environmental experts as a means of reducing global carbon emissions.
[00:40:50.498 --> 00:41:04.888]   Paul Joseph Watson wrote, everyone would be issued with a carbon allowance card that would entail all adults receiving an equal tradable carbon allowance that reduces over time in line with national carbon targets.
[00:41:05.148 --> 00:41:10.770]  The authors make it clear that the program would be a national mandatory policy.
[00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:32.615]   Also, the uproar at the border where Border Patrol has made a record 1 millionth stop is merely the beginning as the State Department announced that it will increase its allotment of immigrants from 62,500 in the fiscal year of 2021 to 125,000 in 2022, while NGOs across the United States
[00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:39.596]   funnel the invasion into cities in red states, including Florida, Texas, Missouri and
[00:41:39.596 --> 00:41:45.175]   Georgia. Biden`s approval will plummet, but that`s all just part of the plan.
[00:41:45.175 --> 00:41:48.965]  We stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history.
[00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:56.056]   And I`m here today to share with you how the United States intends to work with partners and
[00:41:56.056 --> 00:41:58.775]  allies to answer these questions.
[00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:05.699]   I believe we, and particularly you, has an incredible window of opportunity to lead in
[00:42:05.699 --> 00:42:14.299]  shaping a new world order for the 21st century.
[00:42:14.299 --> 00:42:17.259]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[00:42:17.259 --> 00:42:20.178]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[00:42:20.178 --> 00:42:23.259]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[00:42:23.259 --> 00:42:27.779]   We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:29.579]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is super popular.
[00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:33.258]   It's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential, great amino acids,
[00:42:33.258 --> 00:42:34.258]  and it tastes great.
[00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:36.819]  It's powder form, so in the water, you absorb.
[00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:39.097]  Absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[00:42:39.097 --> 00:42:42.958]   Then we also have back in stock, this sale will continue through next week, Knockout
[00:42:42.958 --> 00:42:46.717]   Sleep Aid with eight organic ingredients that help you sleep better.

[00:43:20.822 --> 00:43:22.043]  This is not a game.
[00:43:22.947 --> 00:43:24.168]  This is not a joke.
[00:43:24.208 --> 00:43:33.556]  If you're watching us on Saturday evening here in the US or early morning in Australia, it is up to you to take this video and take this feed and share it.
[00:43:33.616 --> 00:43:34.617]  This is a war.
[00:43:35.578 --> 00:43:39.001]  Now we're about to go to our guest, our first guest from Australia, who's up in the middle of the night.
[00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:43.144]  I appreciate him joining us, but I want to tie this in to what you just saw in that John Bowne report.
[00:43:44.345 --> 00:44:05.362]   That was Climate Czar John Kerry a week ago saying the corporations are implementing this your credit card will tax you for eating beef for driving a car and then they'll turn it off when they say scanning you tracking you Australia is already saying in New South Wales what England's saying oh the new climate app will be on your
[00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:07.833]  Vaccine passport.
[00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:09.994]  So that's why they're locking you down first.
[00:44:10.074 --> 00:44:12.815]  They admit to get you ready for the climate lockdowns.
[00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.516]  This is prison control.
[00:44:15.057 --> 00:44:15.757]  They've said this.
[00:44:15.857 --> 00:44:18.398]  I told you this was coming decades ago in their own documents.
[00:44:18.458 --> 00:44:19.659]  Now it's operational.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:20.820]  U.N.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.923]  planning permanent lockdown warns Mark Moreno, Senate advisor to the Republican Party, goes over all the documents.
[00:44:26.943 --> 00:44:30.145]  But here's, here's, you know, the globalists saying it.
[00:44:30.665 --> 00:44:31.726]  John Kerry and others.
[00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:33.747]  So it's here.
[00:44:34.855 --> 00:44:37.036]  And it's all part of looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:44:37.357 --> 00:44:46.302]  Wall Street Journal says they'll incrementally turn off your resources until you're too poor to have children and make you become sterilized to get your guaranteed universal income.
[00:44:46.722 --> 00:44:52.626]  That's why they need to bankrupt all the small businesses and farms to dictate your surrender, the terms of it.
[00:44:53.106 --> 00:44:55.248]  This is a diabolical plan.
[00:44:55.288 --> 00:44:59.891]  The lockdowns of the third world caused the implosion of Africa, Latin America, Asia, Middle East.
[00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:04.334]  Now they're all coming here, organized by the UN, to be brought in and do what?
[00:45:04.414 --> 00:45:05.775]  Bankrupt our countries further.
[00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:11.179]  So they attack the third world, impoverish them, then organize them with reverse colonialism.
[00:45:12.881 --> 00:45:14.782]  And here's the stories out of Australia.
[00:45:15.202 --> 00:45:15.442]  U.S.
[00:45:15.482 --> 00:45:19.684]  Republicans call for sanctions against Australia for police treatment of protesters.
[00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:20.404]  Absolutely.
[00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:21.624]  This looks like Tiananmen Square.
[00:45:22.084 --> 00:45:22.565]  Here's another one.
[00:45:22.585 --> 00:45:24.805]  Monica Schmidt coming on in 15 minutes with our first guest.
[00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:31.308]  Anti-vaxxer leader reveals that she has been in jail.
[00:45:31.368 --> 00:45:47.083]   So again, Monica Schmidt, anti-vaxxer leader, has been released by the Supreme Court On Bond, and she's going to be joining us, held for six months for doing absolutely nothing.
[00:45:48.244 --> 00:45:49.564]  And now we've got video coming up.
[00:45:49.604 --> 00:45:59.029]  We'll play in about 20 minutes of them coming to people's homes and saying, we're basically going to arrest you if you ever go out and protest.
[00:45:59.049 --> 00:45:59.889]  We're watching you.
[00:45:59.909 --> 00:46:03.431]  So this is the equivalent of North Korea taking over.
[00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:04.491]  Simply amazing.
[00:46:04.572 --> 00:46:05.252]  So joining us.
[00:46:06.878 --> 00:46:10.501]  is Simon Boykoff and he is the Aussie Cossack.
[00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:12.503]  What an interesting backstory he's got.
[00:46:12.543 --> 00:46:25.974]  His family escaped to Australia because they were loyal to the Tsars, white Russians, loyal to the Christian system over there, a lot better than the communists, and escaped to Australia generations ago.
[00:46:26.875 --> 00:46:30.877]  And now, here they are, seeing the very same globalist takeover.
[00:46:30.917 --> 00:46:42.782]  The same globalist families that financed the Bolsheviks in 1917, who used the same tactics of locking people down in their houses, taking over the farms, putting people in re-education camps, has now come to Australia, and it's now coming to America.
[00:46:43.162 --> 00:47:06.653]   And I'm going to go to our guest with the exact same plan that is in all of the CDC reports, and Australian reports, and EU reports, and UK reports, and Canadian reports, calls it Emergency plans to shield in place and shield centers to quote, take healthy people and put them in re-education camps where they'll quote, grow crops and other labors.
[00:47:07.353 --> 00:47:09.796]  It says on the CDC website, you will work in a camp.
[00:47:10.456 --> 00:47:11.217]  This is their dream.
[00:47:11.277 --> 00:47:12.398]  It's how they collapse society.
[00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:17.883]  Take you, put you on a camp for five years, working for them till you're quote, re-educated, if you even live.
[00:47:18.224 --> 00:47:23.488]   So joining us is Simon Boykov, we really appreciate him coming on.
[00:47:23.548 --> 00:47:28.831]  He's at patreon.com forward slash Aussie Cossack and on YouTube at Aussie Cossack.
[00:47:29.092 --> 00:47:30.172]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:47:30.252 --> 00:47:38.578]  And just I'm gonna try to give you the floor for 15 minutes or so ahead of our next guest to lay out since you were on with us a month ago, the intensification of what's happening there in Australia.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.761]  G'day, Alex, and it's a pleasure to be on the program.
[00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:47.644]  Thank you very much on behalf of the Australian people for giving us a voice.
[00:47:48.905 --> 00:47:50.526]  Because it's very concerning at the moment.
[00:47:51.438 --> 00:48:00.804]  Australians are under very serious censorship and the mainstream media in Australia is blocking any dissent.
[00:48:01.344 --> 00:48:06.667]  The Australian people cannot speak out and they're taken to the streets.
[00:48:06.787 --> 00:48:10.009]  There are mass protests in Australia, especially in the city of Melbourne.
[00:48:10.869 --> 00:48:21.565]   The only reason that that's happening is because people are not allowed to voice their opinion and to criticise the government using more traditional methods such as Through the media.
[00:48:21.585 --> 00:48:27.289]  The media is completely on the government side and silencing all dissent.
[00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:39.307]   It's great to be able to be on the program today and I hope to uncover many of the terrible, terrible Realities that Australians are facing today.
[00:48:39.367 --> 00:48:52.009]  And of course, it's great to speak to the American people about this because I would agree with those who say that if this has happened in Australia, it's only a matter of time before this comes to the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
[00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:58.571]  And the scenes you see unfolding on your screen, of course, are riot police in Melbourne dressed as military.
[00:48:59.031 --> 00:49:01.151]  Now, these are police who are not wearing insignia.
[00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:09.250]   There are reports and video reports of military on the streets of Melbourne without any identifying
[00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.250]  patches.
[00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:14.689]   It's unclear whether this is Australian military, this is foreign military, but the government
[00:49:14.689 --> 00:49:17.451]  is absolutely out of control.
[00:49:17.451 --> 00:49:19.210]  It's like a monkey with a grenade.
[00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.849]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[00:49:21.849 --> 00:49:26.889]   The international community is starting to take note of what the Australian police are
[00:49:26.889 --> 00:49:31.529]   doing and the brutality, the fear and intimidation tactics they're committing against unarmed
[00:49:31.529 --> 00:49:33.770]  civilians.
[00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:39.730]   I thank the Republican senator in America, Senator Kew, for his position where he calls
[00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.210]  upon sanctions on the Australian government.
[00:49:42.592 --> 00:49:44.133]  Now, I'm an Australian patriot.
[00:49:44.153 --> 00:49:44.934]  I love this country.
[00:49:46.095 --> 00:49:48.216]  But we need sanctions.
[00:49:48.276 --> 00:49:54.861]  We need diplomatic pressure from the outside world because our politicians don't want to listen to the people.
[00:49:55.321 --> 00:49:57.643]  Our politicians are absolutely out of control.
[00:49:58.183 --> 00:50:00.845]  They're unaccountable.
[00:50:03.222 --> 00:50:04.923]  No one can tell them what to do.
[00:50:04.943 --> 00:50:08.144]  The people, in fact the Parliament isn't even sitting anymore.
[00:50:08.724 --> 00:50:11.806]  Laws and restrictions are made up during press conferences.
[00:50:12.326 --> 00:50:39.868]   We just had news a few days ago that the Australian Independent Commission Against Corruption, which is supposed to be in place to safeguard the political system against politicians, against corruption of politicians, is now losing its powers, being receded, and both major parties, the Labour and Liberal Party, have combined In a monopoly to ram these powers through Parliament like thieves in the night.
[00:50:40.468 --> 00:51:00.357]   Just recently also we've had a significant, very scary development, the introduction of the Surveillance Act, the Identify and Disrupt Bill, which effectively gives the government power to access information on anyone's device, computer, telephone, disrupt information, delete information, add information, We have absolutely no rights.
[00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:05.081]  As you can see on the screen, there's video images of Monica Smith getting arrested.
[00:51:05.101 --> 00:51:07.703]  We're very happy that Monica Smith is out of jail now.
[00:51:09.044 --> 00:51:14.669]  She's an activist who was arrested for thought crimes, for inciting protests.
[00:51:15.009 --> 00:51:25.538]  Now, I know this sounds absurd to our American viewers, our friends in America, and many of them have been following what's happening here, but in Australia, you can now be arrested for committing a thought crime.
[00:51:27.088 --> 00:51:37.232]  Not only going to a protest, but even thinking about going to a protest, or talking about going to a protest, or proposing to go to a protest is enough now to land you in jail.
[00:51:37.693 --> 00:51:42.535]  And there are hundreds and there are thousands of political prisoners now in Australia.
[00:51:42.575 --> 00:51:47.097]  The Australian government is waging a war against its own population, against the civilians.
[00:51:47.677 --> 00:51:57.460]   Police are using smoke grenades, tear gas, High-powered rifles, shooting rubber bullets, shooting people in the head.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.641]  And Simon, I want to spend time on the North Korean or Tiananmen Square level abuse.
[00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:10.243]  That's very important, but I want to go back to this police state legislation the Governor General, I guess, put in and then just raced through with no review.
[00:52:10.744 --> 00:52:18.206]  It actually said in there, I read it on air, that they can go in and pose as you on your Facebook or Twitter or other social media.
[00:52:19.166 --> 00:52:21.147]  And then actually false flag.
[00:52:21.207 --> 00:52:26.531]  I mean, it's that they can spy on you without a warrant when you don't even know, or it's just a blank warrant.
[00:52:26.951 --> 00:52:29.192]  I mean, this is again, this is stuff right out of Communist China.
[00:52:30.913 --> 00:52:37.818]  Well, I think the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party would be very jealous of the Australian government.
[00:52:37.878 --> 00:52:46.703]  The Australian government has gone from being the most lenient or free in the most free society to probably the most restricted.
[00:52:48.017 --> 00:52:48.800]  In a matter of months.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.886]  You know, we don't recognize the country we live in.
[00:52:51.654 --> 00:52:54.415]  45,000 people have left the country in the last few months.
[00:52:54.575 --> 00:52:56.896]  This is an authoritarian transformation.
[00:52:56.916 --> 00:52:59.176]  I want you to go back to that and back to how they're attacking you.
[00:52:59.216 --> 00:53:02.417]  But for those that don't know, some listeners, the majority, get it.
[00:53:02.777 --> 00:53:07.079]  Some are saying, why in the hell are you obsessing over a country of 27 million people?
[00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:10.000]  Why in the hell are you so concerned about this?
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.281]  Because I know that the globalists control the British Empire.
[00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:17.062]  What was left of it created the New World Order.
[00:53:17.102 --> 00:53:18.802]  They admit that curl quickly at Georgetown.
[00:53:18.822 --> 00:53:20.763]  Bill Clinton's mentors wrote books about it.
[00:53:21.363 --> 00:53:26.065]  It's all admitted, you know, Hillary's now, you know, been given royal titles, all of this.
[00:53:26.785 --> 00:53:36.108]  And these individuals are forming the core of the New World Order and they admit Australia is the model of, again, the, quote, shield program.
[00:53:36.128 --> 00:53:41.250]  They're going to take children, quote, to camps if the parents haven't inoculated them for their safety.
[00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.190]  That's been announced there.
[00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.311]  It's been announced on the CDC document.
[00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:45.691]  I've confirmed they're setting them up here.
[00:53:45.711 --> 00:53:47.072]  It's on the CDC's website.
[00:53:47.372 --> 00:53:49.833]  The CDC's announced they can take over all the rents, all the homes.
[00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:54.012]   we're being put into martial law this is the pretext and John Kerry and others
[00:53:54.012 --> 00:53:56.613]   admit they're not going to track everything you do with your credit cards
[00:53:56.613 --> 00:54:00.573]   your phone and tax you and control you and they they admit Trudeau admits in
[00:54:00.573 --> 00:54:04.653]   Canada they're getting you ready with this everybody needs to understand what's
[00:54:04.653 --> 00:54:08.253]   happening in Europe what's happening in Canada what's happening Australia is the
[00:54:08.253 --> 00:54:13.493]   plan we have to decry it here of what's happening there or they will standardize
[00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:21.963]   it and beta test it and bring it here please continue Simon yeah just like to mention there's been a lot of support
[00:54:21.963 --> 00:54:27.553]   from people in America to the Australian people especially those people who live in
[00:54:27.553 --> 00:54:31.649]   the southern states And a lot of them are saying things, you know, like, don't surrender your guns.
[00:54:31.669 --> 00:54:33.550]  And that's exactly right.
[00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:36.751]  We don't have any guns in Australia.
[00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:38.952]  We are defenceless against the government.
[00:54:40.693 --> 00:54:44.375]  We don't have any ability to defend ourselves, even in the political sense.
[00:54:44.835 --> 00:54:48.356]  We're not even allowed to speak out and criticise the government.
[00:54:48.376 --> 00:54:49.357]  We're not allowed to protest.
[00:54:49.946 --> 00:54:55.310]  You can be arrested and thrown in jail for walking out onto the street and holding a sign or holding an Aussie flag.
[00:54:57.071 --> 00:55:02.915]  Now, people are proposing from overseas to help Australia.
[00:55:03.355 --> 00:55:11.921]  And there's been talk and there's been offers from people in America to apply pressure on the Australian government from the point of view of the international community.
[00:55:12.922 --> 00:55:21.364]   Now, take this from an Aussie in Sydney with the Eureka flag behind me, which is the flag Of the Eureka Stockade and the Flag of Rebellion.
[00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:23.465]  We need all the help we can get.
[00:55:23.905 --> 00:55:25.086]  And this is an SOS call.
[00:55:25.106 --> 00:55:26.367]  It's a mayday to our allies.
[00:55:27.108 --> 00:55:28.229]  To our allies out there.
[00:55:28.889 --> 00:55:31.931]  If you can, in some way, apply some pressure.
[00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:32.852]  Some political pressure.
[00:55:32.872 --> 00:55:34.293]  I'm not calling upon violence.
[00:55:34.333 --> 00:55:35.254]  I'm making it very clear.
[00:55:35.654 --> 00:55:37.355]  So I won't get arrested for incitement.
[00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:38.476]  That's what the police are waiting for.
[00:55:38.496 --> 00:55:40.958]  For me to slip up so they can charge me.
[00:55:41.098 --> 00:55:44.140]  Just like they charged Monica on two counts of incitement through her into prison.
[00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:51.173]  But if any political pressure can be applied, and if there are any senators, especially Republican senators watching this, we need your help.
[00:55:51.213 --> 00:55:53.874]  The Australian people need help at the moment.
[00:55:55.275 --> 00:56:18.185]   The Australian embassies around the world, the Australian consulates, if you can send them a letter, if you can maybe do a peaceful sort of message, perhaps even hold a sign in front of our embassies, to let the embassies know, to let the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs know, That a Department of Foreign Affairs should I say, that the whole world is watching and the whole world is outraged and shocked.
[00:56:19.286 --> 00:56:22.767]  It certainly is disgusting and disgraceful what the government is doing.
[00:56:23.748 --> 00:56:36.112]  There's even talk here in Australia of having a Nuremberg 2.0 for all of those police and all of those government officials who have committed war crimes against the Australian people.
[00:56:36.953 --> 00:56:42.913]   Now on your screen you can see police using rifle barrels You know, there's a bloke on the floor.
[00:56:43.253 --> 00:56:44.173]  He's disarmed.
[00:56:45.013 --> 00:56:48.335]  He's attacked by police and he was actually pushing a person in a wheelchair.
[00:56:48.355 --> 00:57:00.659]  Now, the person in the wheelchair is sitting in the wheelchair and the person who was pushing, which was on the floor, is disarmed, is not resisting, and he's getting bashed with the rifle barrel into his back.
[00:57:00.699 --> 00:57:01.920]  Now, his hands are behind his back.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.161]  And by the way, I want to be clear, when you do this, it's easy to kill people and I don't see this act tough.
[00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:08.802]  I'm very sad about it and I'm not proud of it, but I didn't start the fights.
[00:57:08.822 --> 00:57:18.196]   When I was a young man, I put two different occasions, people in comas, and one of them is still brain damaged to this day and can't talk right.
[00:57:18.576 --> 00:57:20.257]  And I'm not proud of it.
[00:57:20.297 --> 00:57:21.697]  He attacked me and I overdid it.
[00:57:22.137 --> 00:57:27.098]  But I mean, if I slammed a rifle button, somebody said a couple of times, good chance I'd kill him if you're strong.
[00:57:27.439 --> 00:57:29.799]  These cops are hitting him with everything they've got.
[00:57:30.099 --> 00:57:31.380]  This is assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.200]  This is attempted murder.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:39.929]  There's assault, there's cases of indecent assault, there's a case of a young mother being attacked by five riot police.
[00:57:40.229 --> 00:57:43.233]  They lifted up her dress, exposed her private parts, her underwear.
[00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:44.034]  This is a mother.
[00:57:44.054 --> 00:57:50.844]  You just saw on the screen a grandmother, a 70 year old grandmother, on the floor, on the road.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:55.780]   and she was pushed by police and they finished her off with pepper spray.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.059]   She's on the floor and they finished her off with capsicum spray.
[00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:00.420]  She's no threat whatsoever.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:06.420]   And for those that don't know, they are slamming old ladies that want to sit in the park in the sun
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.859]  to the ground and take them to jail.
[00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:12.900]   They are grabbing little kids away from their mothers and fathers and dragging them away to jail.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.580]   They are building giant facilities all over the country and saying it's going to be permanent
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.659]  and creating these police response forces.
[00:58:18.734 --> 00:58:23.275]  So I interrupted you, and you're making key points here, and you're going to be on as long as you are able to be here in the middle of the night.
[00:58:23.295 --> 00:58:26.176]  And I want to get, of course, Ms.
[00:58:26.376 --> 00:58:30.238]  Schmidt on here in a few minutes, but I interrupted you when you got into...
[00:58:30.952 --> 00:58:34.712]   how people are leaving Australia and I interrupted you when you were getting into you know the types
[00:58:34.712 --> 00:58:40.791]   of violence and other things so lay out here for people and repeat again your SOS because this is
[00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:45.672]   real and when you said that it made me want to get on a plane I was just in DC last week when
[00:58:45.672 --> 00:58:51.272]   they're trying to ban protests there we need everybody to go to the Australian embassy in DC
[00:58:51.272 --> 00:58:56.380]   in fact I'm going to organize I guess very soon And I'm going to be there.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.340]  We're going to go to D.C.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.301]  because this is a big deal.
[00:58:58.321 --> 00:58:59.542]  We need to make a big deal out of this.
[00:58:59.882 --> 00:59:02.024]  What happened in Tiananmen Square was wrong.
[00:59:02.944 --> 00:59:06.447]  And if we don't make a big deal out of this, then it is our fate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:06.467 --> 00:59:07.328]  Please continue, Simon.
[00:59:09.509 --> 00:59:19.096]  The people of Australia would be so proud and comforted to see their fellow allies, American citizens, at the Australian Embassy.
[00:59:19.477 --> 00:59:21.678]  Now, again, we're not inciting anything.
[00:59:21.698 --> 00:59:22.559]  We're not inciting violence.
[00:59:23.177 --> 00:59:24.238]  We need a political message.
[00:59:24.439 --> 00:59:28.483]  We need the Australian Government who are drunk on power.
[00:59:28.744 --> 00:59:30.085]  They're absolutely drunk on power.
[00:59:30.486 --> 00:59:31.887]  They don't even see what they're doing.
[00:59:32.108 --> 00:59:33.630]  They need to be told from the outside.
[00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:41.275]   Now we know that Australia is very reliant on America in a strategic sense and Australia has He's in a very precarious position.
[00:59:41.295 --> 00:59:45.156]  It has China, very strong military power to the north.
[00:59:45.216 --> 00:59:49.818]  Indonesia, you know, they have 40 Russian-made submarines in their disposal.
[00:59:49.838 --> 00:59:51.078]  Australia hardly has any submarines.
[00:59:51.138 --> 00:59:53.279]  Australia hardly has any military.
[00:59:53.399 --> 00:59:59.361]  We have 49,000 active personnel and we've got about 28 million people living in Australia.
[00:59:59.701 --> 01:00:01.582]  So Australia is very reliant on the United States.
[01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:14.080]   Now, if the United States was to intervene, And call it out and criticise the Australian Government for their heavy police tactics, for their campaign of fear, intimidation and police brutality.
[01:00:14.561 --> 01:00:25.105]   I think that that would be a very effective method and I can certainly say on behalf of the Australian people that we would be very grateful for the international support and the pressure, you know,
[01:00:25.105 --> 01:00:29.795]   on behalf of sticking up, sticking up for these, you know, grandmothers who are being bashed and
[01:00:29.795 --> 01:00:33.945]   pepper sprayed, these, you know, young mothers who are being assaulted, young women like
[01:00:33.945 --> 01:00:39.885]   Monica Smith being jailed for thought crimes, not for going to a protest, ladies and gentlemen, but for
[01:00:39.885 --> 01:00:45.326]   inciting a protest. So for talking about a protest on Telegram, and you're exactly right, we've got
[01:00:45.326 --> 01:00:52.956]   unprecedented laws being passed, you know, corruption, you know, corruption, investigative
[01:00:52.956 --> 01:00:58.546]   bodies are being abolished and their laws are being, their powers are being retracted.
[01:00:58.768 --> 01:01:03.553]  For example, the police complaint line, if you call it, it's the LECC, it's called.
[01:01:04.454 --> 01:01:12.582]  If you ring them now, it goes straight to the voicemail and says, because of COVID-19, this information line, this hotline is no longer operating.
[01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:26.719]   So the government has He's trying to abolish all forms of accountability when it comes to police powers, and the citizens absolutely have no way of speaking up.
[01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.921]  It's all a giant exercise of power.
[01:01:28.941 --> 01:01:34.464]  We're going to lay it out with Simon Boykov, and of course, we're about to go to Monica Schmidt.
[01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:37.947]  I want to just lay out some of the questions I've got for you and her as we go to her.
[01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:38.847]  We've got plenty of time.
[01:01:39.148 --> 01:01:41.029]  As long as you guys can stay up, this is so amazing.
[01:01:42.622 --> 01:01:53.951]  What does it feel like for her to be one of the first to really start standing up six months ago, to be thrown in jail, and to now see when she was out demonstrating it was 20 people, 30 people, now it's hundreds of thousands, now it's millions.
[01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:56.894]  So it looks like their attempt at intimidation isn't working.
[01:01:57.934 --> 01:02:08.723]  We now know there's massive censorship on the internet with Facebook, Twitter, and others aren't showing the police brutality, they're blocking the feeds, like helping China cover up Tiananmen Square, which our media didn't do in 1989.
[01:02:09.744 --> 01:02:10.905]  This is just unprecedented.
[01:02:11.305 --> 01:02:14.567]  Other women being arrested at their homes for organizing demonstrations.
[01:02:14.587 --> 01:02:16.808]  We've seen that footage, the numbers of people.
[01:02:16.848 --> 01:02:22.512]  What's happening while you're in these thought crime prisons as political prisoners?
[01:02:23.092 --> 01:02:23.752]  Just absolutely.
[01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:27.795]  Why are they mainly focusing on the South with the most draconian controls?
[01:02:28.155 --> 01:02:31.917]  Why are all their leaders announcing it's a new world order and saying it's permanent?
[01:02:32.157 --> 01:02:50.048]   Those are some of the questions I'm going to ask you both, but here is just a short clip of her getting arrested for the thought crime of saying, you have a right to stand up, you should stand up as rifle butts are cracking your face for a virus cooked up by Fauci and released by these very people for the power grab they're now engaged in.
[01:02:50.108 --> 01:02:52.530]  It's in the Rockefeller document, Operation Lockstep.
[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.792]  So here is Monica Schmidt, and then we'll go to this modern day hero.
[01:02:58.137 --> 01:03:04.726]  I've just been pulled over by the cops, probably because I'm outside of my 5Ks, but we'll see what happens.
[01:03:04.746 --> 01:03:08.430]  So I just thought I'd put the live stream on, just in case.
[01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:31.849]   I don't know why I just took my seatbelt off, that was stupid.
[01:03:31.911 --> 01:03:32.211]  Hi, good, you?
[01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:35.812]  We're just from the Springvale Police Station.
[01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:41.173]  At the moment, we need to have a chat to you about a matter of incitement, so I need to place you under arrest for that, okay?
[01:03:41.213 --> 01:03:41.513]  Pardon?
[01:03:42.133 --> 01:03:44.073]  At the moment, you're under arrest for incitement.
[01:03:44.573 --> 01:03:45.654]  Have you guys been following me?
[01:03:45.674 --> 01:03:47.354]  You do not have to say I do not have anything to say to you.
[01:03:47.374 --> 01:03:48.214]  You may report and give evidence.
[01:03:48.234 --> 01:03:48.914]  Do you understand that?
[01:03:51.055 --> 01:03:51.995]  Do you understand that, Monica?
[01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:52.455]  No comment.
[01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:53.235]  Okay.
[01:03:53.495 --> 01:03:55.275]  Please share this video as much as possible.
[01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:56.996]  Monica Smith has just been arrested for incitement.
[01:03:56.816 --> 01:03:57.816]  for insulting me.
[01:03:57.816 --> 01:03:58.816]  Can you turn that off for me, please?
[01:03:58.816 --> 01:03:59.816]  I'm gonna find, we're saving that.
[01:03:59.816 --> 01:04:00.816]  I'm gonna turn that off.
[01:04:00.816 --> 01:04:07.495]   So here is another clip of her, what she was arrested for.
[01:04:07.468 --> 01:04:12.870]  Here is the thought crime in the once free country, now known as, not Australia, but New North Korea.
[01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:13.730]  here it is.
[01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:14.730]  You agree with everything that we're saying?
[01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:15.730]  Yeah.
[01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:16.730]  He does.
[01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:17.730]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.730]  And so she tried to speak.
[01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:36.990]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:37.736]  They tried to arrest her.
[01:04:37.756 --> 01:04:38.396]  People stood up.
[01:04:39.117 --> 01:04:40.558]  The thugs trying to assault a woman.
[01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:45.622]  They call that incitement because she made them beat up that man and take him to jail.
[01:04:46.103 --> 01:04:46.603]  Incredible.
[01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:51.667]  Joining us again in the middle of the early morning is the lady, Monica Schmidt.
[01:04:51.747 --> 01:04:53.849]  Here's the headline out of the biggest newspaper in Australia.
[01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:57.692]  Anti-vax leader reveals engagement after release from jail.
[01:04:58.233 --> 01:05:12.272]   News.com.au, Australia's leading news site, reports she's been released after the Supreme Court said That she's being basically held for too long without bail, but she still faces time in prison.
[01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:15.515]  So we really appreciate Monica Schmidt.
[01:05:15.855 --> 01:05:16.976]  We really appreciate her joining us.
[01:05:17.036 --> 01:05:18.177]  Wow, just amazing times.
[01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:19.699]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.161]  Oh, it's an absolute honor.
[01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:23.763]  I'm so excited to be on here.
[01:05:23.803 --> 01:05:25.004]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:05:26.285 --> 01:05:28.647]  Well, they tried to silence you and it's not worked.
[01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:29.668]  You've got the floor right now.
[01:05:32.672 --> 01:05:35.655]  Sure.
[01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:39.839]  Well, I will just set the record straight, Alex.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.404]  I was in prison for 22 days, not six months, although it did feel like six months.
[01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:47.487]  But I had a great legal team, so it wasn't too, too long.
[01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:56.735]   But basically, the bail conditions, Alex, well, I have a website with almost 70,000 subscribers, which in Australia is really quite significant.
[01:05:57.115 --> 01:06:00.358]  And I'm also the Vice President of a newly formed political party.
[01:06:00.918 --> 01:06:06.522]  Now, they actually wanted me to delete my entire website in the bail conditions.
[01:06:07.243 --> 01:06:12.808]  So I was absolutely, it wasn't even a question whether or not I could sign those bail conditions.
[01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:14.349]  The wording was really interesting.
[01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:19.393]  It said, you must delete everything that incites opposition.
[01:06:20.137 --> 01:06:24.799]  To the Chief Health Officer's directions, which is anything that is to do with COVID.
[01:06:25.239 --> 01:06:37.805]  So basically what they were saying is, is not that I was inciting people to break show directions, but that I was inciting opposition, which is literally just me speaking out that I don't agree with things.
[01:06:37.905 --> 01:06:45.628]  Now, I don't know about what you think about political parties, but it's pretty much a political party's job to oppose the current government.
[01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:59.528]  So if I had signed that bail conditions, my whole year of work, the 70,000 subscribers, the seven staff that I had, would have all been absolutely just deleted off the face of the website.
[01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:01.056]  So I didn't sign it.
[01:07:01.096 --> 01:07:07.160]  On top of that, there was curfews in place for myself personally, above any show directions.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:15.546]  So I would have to be in my home at 7pm till 6am every single day until my actual hearing, which could be two years away.
[01:07:16.086 --> 01:07:19.048]  So I was absolutely not willing to sign that.
[01:07:19.088 --> 01:07:20.349]  So it was a really easy decision.
[01:07:20.899 --> 01:07:28.187]  But then, you know, when I was on my way to prison in a prison transport truck, I realized what I had signed myself up for.
[01:07:28.567 --> 01:07:33.352]  But look, it worked out really well and I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I don't regret anything and I wouldn't take it back.
[01:07:33.472 --> 01:07:36.155]  And it's been really great for the movement here in Australia.
[01:07:36.235 --> 01:07:37.436]  It's woken a lot of people up.
[01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:47.705]   It's given a lot of people courage because You know, not everyone can do the same thing because we all have different states in life and different abilities, but everyone can do probably more than what they're doing.
[01:07:48.205 --> 01:07:50.187]  And that was my calling at that moment.
[01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:56.792]  I don't have children, so I was able to go to prison for 22 days and no one was seriously traumatised by that.
[01:07:56.852 --> 01:08:03.137]  So that was something that I could do for Australia to bring awareness internationally and locally to what's going on.
[01:08:03.437 --> 01:08:10.240]   The fact that someone like me, who has never been in trouble with the police, who's respected. I'm very well networked in the political
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.590]   scene in Australia and so forth and so for someone like me to go to prison, I
[01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:18.770]   think it was a shock for Australia and internationally and I'm glad to have been
[01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:24.000]   given the opportunity to stand up for my rights because you know I would rather
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.570]   be in prison than to willingly sign away my rights which at the
[01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:33.369]   moment Australians are obviously a lot of rights are being taken from us. In
[01:08:33.369 --> 01:08:35.430]   fact you know it's interesting. I want to get into that and I want to
[01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:39.338]   apologize for getting that wrong because I had so many articles here. Other people I saw an article
[01:08:39.338 --> 01:08:42.539]   another woman's been in jail for six months but I guess they said she did something
[01:08:42.539 --> 01:08:46.920]   violent. There's a lot of people still in jail and others being arrested.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.224]  I mean, I want to pick your brain because you and Simon are like wartime correspondents.
[01:08:50.244 --> 01:08:53.246]  If this was happening in China, our government would be decrying it.
[01:08:54.087 --> 01:09:01.172]  But instead, the Democrats are saying, we need this here while the borders are wide open and they just let 20,000 Haitians in with no testing.
[01:09:01.953 --> 01:09:06.816]  And the Democrats all have their big galas and parties from Obama to the Grammys to the Emmys to the Oscars.
[01:09:07.137 --> 01:09:07.997]  None of them wear masks.
[01:09:08.057 --> 01:09:11.120]  It's a class thing where poor people wear them, but the elites don't wear them.
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.160]  It's just incredible.
[01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:14.963]  So I want to pick your brain and walk all through this for folks.
[01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:24.176]  For people that don't know, you guys have been under lockdown, I guess, in some cities longer than anywhere else in the world, 500 plus days.
[01:09:24.517 --> 01:09:33.945]  Give us, because you're a very well-spoken lady, so is Simon, give us some of the statistics, because people want to know what's going on there, because we know this is coming here and we don't stop it, and then lay out what happened to you in jail.
[01:09:35.066 --> 01:09:39.089]  Again, more on the attempts to make you agree to do things with your free speech.
[01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:40.571]  I mean, this is scary.
[01:09:43.072 --> 01:09:48.575]  Yeah, so Melbourne has been the worst lockdown in Australia and it's just shocking.
[01:09:48.675 --> 01:09:50.996]  Curfews, five kilometre radiuses.
[01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:54.678]  Everyone, you can just feel how scared everyone is all the time.
[01:09:55.318 --> 01:09:56.739]  You know, old ladies being arrested.
[01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:57.579]  I mean, you've seen it all.
[01:09:57.959 --> 01:10:04.302]  It's so unbelievable to be in a place where everyone in the world just loved to come to Australia.
[01:10:04.322 --> 01:10:11.556]   It was so free and democratic and now it's become the absolute opposite and it's It's so shocking to be here, but it is very traumatic for the people here.
[01:10:11.636 --> 01:10:17.961]  But also, you know, in adversity comes a lot of a lot of fight back, you know.
[01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:23.905]  So actually, Melbourne, we have fought back really, really hard because of how crazy the draconian measures have been.
[01:10:24.245 --> 01:10:25.125]  You've seen the protests.
[01:10:25.145 --> 01:10:26.446]  They've been going for a whole week.
[01:10:26.987 --> 01:10:34.252]   They've blocked down major highways and things like that, even in the face of these guns and these You know, all the police brutality.
[01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:36.133]  So it's really, really encouraging to see that.
[01:10:36.193 --> 01:10:40.497]  So I think we're in a really unique place in Melbourne, is that we're in the most pain.
[01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:42.558]  So we have the most reason to fight back.
[01:10:42.598 --> 01:10:46.541]  And I think we're kind of in the epicentre of the fight back in Australia.
[01:10:46.661 --> 01:10:50.324]  And New South Wales is now fighting back too, as Simon would have mentioned.
[01:10:50.364 --> 01:10:53.647]  But it's like we're living in a Hollywood movie, Alex.
[01:10:53.687 --> 01:10:54.868]  That's really all I can say.
[01:10:56.767 --> 01:10:58.967]  Why do you think they picked Australia?
[01:10:58.987 --> 01:10:59.988]  Because this is all scripted.
[01:11:00.028 --> 01:11:01.648]  It's all a global Great Reset rollout.
[01:11:01.668 --> 01:11:05.109]  They admit it is in the Davos Group announcements.
[01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:11.890]  And we played a clip before he came on of John Kerry, the climate czar, saying, oh, this is a global corporate takeover.
[01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.150]  This is about carbon.
[01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:14.471]  This is about cutting carbon.
[01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.671]  We're going to have carbon lockdowns.
[01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:20.292]  And so it's all official that this was just using the virus to train you to live under a police state.
[01:11:20.612 --> 01:11:24.773]  The corporations of the world are establishing a Chinese style dictatorship.
[01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:26.193]  Why do you think they chose Australia?
[01:11:27.014 --> 01:11:30.056]  And then after you comment, Simon can pop in on this, you guys are free for all.
[01:11:30.896 --> 01:11:35.459]  And why do you think they picked the South to be the most draconian of the most oppressive area?
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.104]  Well, it's obvious, it's obvious that Australia was picked because Australians are generally very laid back people.
[01:11:43.884 --> 01:11:47.247]  Australians are very friendly and they're very trusting to their government.
[01:11:48.007 --> 01:11:51.989]  Now, the Australian people could never have prepared for this.
[01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:54.831]  They don't have guns, firstly, like they do in America.
[01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:55.952]  They're unarmed.
[01:11:56.906 --> 01:11:58.286]  And they trust their government.
[01:11:58.546 --> 01:12:01.807]  You know, we've got this, she'll be right, mate, attitude in Australia.
[01:12:02.548 --> 01:12:10.990]  You know, people here, they're more interested in watching the rugby or the football or the cricket on TV than getting involved in politics.
[01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.571]  When voting is compulsory, a lot of people don't want to vote.
[01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:15.911]  They just go because they have to.
[01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:21.033]  So it looks like Australia has been the guinea pig for the rest of the world.
[01:12:21.773 --> 01:12:28.861]   In particular, the cities of Melbourne, where Monica Smith is, and Sydney, where I am, They've been hit very hard.
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:36.205]  Now they've targeted their experiments and their attacks on the multicultural communities, on the religious communities.
[01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:40.807]  We know in Australia that those communities have been targeted especially.
[01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:45.289]  They've targeted churches, they've closed churches, they've closed mosques.
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:51.873]  People are being denied the right to receive Holy Communion, to pray together, to go to funerals.
[01:12:52.486 --> 01:12:55.067]  People can't say goodbye to their loved ones at the cemetery.
[01:12:55.307 --> 01:12:57.128]  There are people getting arrested at the cemetery.
[01:12:57.569 --> 01:13:02.931]  There are people that are being denied basic medical rights.
[01:13:02.951 --> 01:13:04.112]  They can't visit their doctor.
[01:13:04.132 --> 01:13:05.152]  They can't visit a hospital.
[01:13:05.573 --> 01:13:08.154]  So this is just an exercise in total martial law.
[01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:09.555]  I want to get Ms.
[01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:10.495]  Schmidt's take on that.
[01:13:10.795 --> 01:13:12.336]  Why do you think Australia was the beta test?
[01:13:12.376 --> 01:13:14.377]  Why do you think they targeted your town the most?
[01:13:17.717 --> 01:13:23.463]  I think that, and I heard Simon saying, that we are very laid back people and we've had it very easy.
[01:13:24.865 --> 01:13:33.193]  For the last, you know, since the Eureka Stockade, really, we haven't had to fight too much for our freedoms and for the leisurely life that we live.
[01:13:33.894 --> 01:13:35.415]  I think we were perfect for it.
[01:13:35.895 --> 01:13:37.697]  And we are very, she'll be right.
[01:13:38.337 --> 01:13:39.238]  Nothing really bothers us.
[01:13:39.278 --> 01:13:42.180]  We just, you know, we just grit it and we just keep going.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:43.821]  We're very friendly.
[01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:45.902]  And I think that's, that's one of the reasons why.
[01:13:46.042 --> 01:13:50.245]  And I know that we're talking a lot about the negative side of things and it's true.
[01:13:50.305 --> 01:13:54.028]  We can't go to everything that we can't do, Alex, is to do with our health.
[01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:58.711]  Every single thing we cannot do is helping our mental state.
[01:13:58.731 --> 01:14:05.189]   So everything that helps us, communities, groups, exercise, everything is anti-health and it's to
[01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:08.299]  break us psychologically.
[01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:10.179]  So we're in a psychological warfare.
[01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.718]  You talk about that, we all talk about that.
[01:14:12.718 --> 01:14:15.979]   Sometimes it's easier when it's actually with physical weapons because then you can see
[01:14:15.979 --> 01:14:17.199]  the tyranny.
[01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:22.499]   But it's psychological and I think the way that we're going to beat it is with our psyche
[01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:37.117]  So we have to have courage of conviction as a collective unit, country and world to actually beat them because what they're trying to do is beat us down psychologically so that we feel like we've already lost because if we think we've lost, well, then we're going to lose, aren't we?
[01:14:37.177 --> 01:14:37.898]  So that's right.
[01:14:37.917 --> 01:14:44.057]   For those who don't know, it's a standard psychological oppression to create mass depression
[01:14:44.057 --> 01:14:48.617]   and mass psychosis, to put pressure on, take pressure off, put pressure on, take pressure
[01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.176]  off, but always squeeze down harder as you go.
[01:14:52.176 --> 01:14:55.476]   And then it's like boot camp, put you through hell, but now you're part of the team.
[01:14:55.476 --> 01:14:59.677]   They are putting you through hell to then accept the new digital pass, the new vaccine
[01:14:59.677 --> 01:15:03.997]   pass, which they admit publicly, and Australia is the test zone, right where you're at, to
[01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:06.956]   then be the new carbon tracker for the new corporate governance.
[01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:17.768]  I mean, this is a corporate takeover of our bodies, and then to track and trace this for a neo-feudalist system, because the world was rejecting their program, so they launched Operation Lockstep.
[01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:21.849]  I mean, I think it's clear you guys know that, and you're victims of it.
[01:15:21.869 --> 01:15:26.991]  I think it's key to get the word out to leaders and others around the world, the people, that this is a war for the world.
[01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:30.759]  As another Australian said, this is a global corporate takeover of the planet.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.263]  Please continue, Ms Schmidt.
[01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:35.892]  Well, yeah, the vaccine passports, you know, so...
[01:15:36.754 --> 01:15:41.078]  And what you said about the uncertainty, it's a weapon in itself.
[01:15:41.278 --> 01:15:44.100]  You don't know if you can go ahead with your wedding plans.
[01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:47.283]  You can't even die because you might not be able to have anyone at your funeral.
[01:15:47.563 --> 01:15:51.947]  It's this constant not knowing what the government's going to do every single day.
[01:15:52.047 --> 01:16:00.273]  Tomorrow the playgrounds might be closed, the next day it might be open, and if it's open you should be grateful because it used to be closed, but yet it's your human right anyway.
[01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:04.397]  So you're right, it's absolutely psychological warfare.
[01:16:04.437 --> 01:16:05.317]  It's so interesting.
[01:16:06.502 --> 01:16:14.088]  So the last thing my Premier said in Victoria, Daniel Andrews, is that we've got this roadmap out of out of lockdown, right?
[01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:21.393]  So and the exciting thing is, is by Christmas, we might be able to sit outside of cafes, but we'll have to be vaccinated.
[01:16:22.402 --> 01:16:26.025]  But that's absolutely illegal to enforce anything like that.
[01:16:26.145 --> 01:16:31.129]  But he just says these things and hopes that people just get vaccinated because they want to go to a cafe.
[01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:36.953]  But in fact, it's totally discrimination to not let someone eat somewhere because they don't want to take a medical procedure.
[01:16:37.213 --> 01:16:38.274]  But he just says it anyway.
[01:16:38.614 --> 01:16:40.436]  So it's that coercion.
[01:16:40.716 --> 01:16:48.842]  And especially when the shot doesn't work and isn't a vaccine and it's a gene therapy and the countries with the highest vaccination rate have the highest illness rate.
[01:16:49.382 --> 01:16:51.464]  And then Australia had almost none of these illnesses.
[01:16:52.145 --> 01:16:55.387]  But now you're getting all these weird illnesses like everybody else now that they're taking the injections.
[01:16:55.447 --> 01:17:00.791]  I mean, this is just, again, crazy corporations with a world government plan going for broke.
[01:17:00.831 --> 01:17:01.572]  Sorry, please continue.
[01:17:03.171 --> 01:17:04.892]  Well, with the vaccines, it's really interesting.
[01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:11.797]  What I've noticed is if you ask someone why you get vaccinated, no one actually says they're getting vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID.
[01:17:12.238 --> 01:17:18.582]  They're getting vaccinated because they think they might be able to travel and they might be able to go to weddings and cafes, or they might be protecting someone else.
[01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:22.185]  But then I'm like, well, why would someone else get vaccinated then?
[01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:25.284]  Who's actually getting vaccinated for themselves?
[01:17:25.884 --> 01:17:27.124]  I don't even know one person who is.
[01:17:27.144 --> 01:17:35.707]  Oh, but now they announced nationally that if you've been vaccinated and have all the shots, you get an extra hour a day outside.
[01:17:35.727 --> 01:17:37.568]  Oh, aren't you a nice little prisoner?
[01:17:37.848 --> 01:17:39.789]  You're a trustee now in the penal colony.
[01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:45.620]  Well, in New South Wales, you can have a picnic with five people, but they have to be vaccinated.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.121]  Now, who's policing this?
[01:17:47.221 --> 01:17:52.285]  Are you calling your friend and saying, I'd love to have a picnic with you, but can you please bring your vaccine certificate with you?
[01:17:52.665 --> 01:17:53.846]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:17:54.086 --> 01:18:07.517]  In New South Wales, children from all ages can now, now, they haven't been able to for two months, I think, but now they can choose two friends from within a five kilometre radius of some sort, but they can't change their two friends.
[01:18:07.837 --> 01:18:09.218]  They have to keep the same two friends.
[01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.772]  Who's policing this, Alex?
[01:18:10.832 --> 01:18:13.473]  I mean, who's policing these two-hour exercise times?
[01:18:13.853 --> 01:18:16.294]  Do people actually believe that they can police this?
[01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:17.515]  Well, they can't, obviously.
[01:18:17.795 --> 01:18:22.478]  But they just... So let me ask you both this.
[01:18:22.518 --> 01:18:23.238]  You first, Ms.
[01:18:23.258 --> 01:18:23.658]  Schmidt.
[01:18:23.718 --> 01:18:25.499]  Again, you're really awake for the middle of the night.
[01:18:25.519 --> 01:18:26.540]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.802]  I mean, I know that's a sacrifice, because I've done late night and early morning shows that kill you the next day.
[01:18:31.782 --> 01:18:32.623]  Talking about this...
[01:18:34.111 --> 01:18:40.962]  Why are they on TV saying, don't look at the sunset, don't talk to your neighbors, this is a new world order, and then the health minister's going...
[01:18:41.957 --> 01:18:42.817]  There'll be more shots.
[01:18:42.877 --> 01:18:43.478]  It never ends.
[01:18:43.538 --> 01:18:46.319]  I mean, they look like criminals out of a science fiction.
[01:18:46.339 --> 01:18:47.280]  They look like villains.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.500]  They look like the Joker.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.681]  They even act evil.
[01:18:49.961 --> 01:18:51.882]  Then you've got the fake Christian Prime Minister.
[01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:53.343]  Oh, you've got freedom.
[01:18:53.363 --> 01:18:54.023]  You don't have to take it.
[01:18:54.243 --> 01:19:00.467]  Then he lets all of the regions run wild and he goes along with it while he flies off on private jets.
[01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:04.069]  I mean, they're just a bunch of knuckle-dragging scoundrels.
[01:19:04.549 --> 01:19:07.551]   I'm sorry I'm ranting, but what about New Zealand as well.
[01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:11.034]  Canada says, if you're unvaccinated, you can't have more than five people at your house.
[01:19:11.354 --> 01:19:17.499]  I mean, this is just so... I'm just so upset to know this is coming to my town as well.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.603]  Why is it not more obvious to the world that this is a crazy cult?
[01:19:21.943 --> 01:19:25.326]  I mean, even the Scientologists don't tell you you can't look at the sunset.
[01:19:28.388 --> 01:19:29.389]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:31.238 --> 01:19:34.340]  Yeah, so basically, like I said, they're trying to break us.
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.701]  That's everything that I can say.
[01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:39.003]  They want to take everything away from us that makes us happy.
[01:19:39.824 --> 01:19:43.747]  Connection is the number one reason why people don't get depressed.
[01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:47.469]  It's the number one reason why people are depressed because they don't have enough connection.
[01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:54.394]  So they are trying to basically make the entire nation of Australia depressed so that we will do whatever they say.
[01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:57.759]  Now, tyrants don't negotiate, okay?
[01:19:57.779 --> 01:20:08.121]  So when the people find a way around the system, which they have in Victoria, they set up cocktail, a cocktail route around the city that was all outside and people were wearing masks and everything.
[01:20:08.441 --> 01:20:10.201]  And our premier said, you can't do that.
[01:20:10.461 --> 01:20:11.702]  You can't drink cocktails.
[01:20:11.742 --> 01:20:17.883]  You have to, you know, and so these tyrants, they actually get worse, the cleverer the people get.
[01:20:18.003 --> 01:20:20.904]  So they're just trying to break us and we're not going to break Alex.
[01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:22.604]  So they can do whatever they want.
[01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:23.645]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:23.465 --> 01:20:25.384]  Trying to break you for what though?
[01:20:25.384 --> 01:20:29.304]  To accept the carbon tax, the ID, the digital app?
[01:20:29.304 --> 01:20:30.664]  But I mean it's so damn obvious.
[01:20:30.664 --> 01:20:35.064]   Klaus Schwab says, "We will make them very angry until they submit to Great Reset."
[01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:38.465]  As if we don't know he's the one doing it for the Great Reset.
[01:20:38.465 --> 01:20:39.465]  Simon?
[01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:40.465]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:46.065]   In regards to what can be done, I mean the Australian people are doing whatever they
[01:20:46.065 --> 01:20:47.465]  can do.
[01:20:47.465 --> 01:20:51.545]   You mentioned something earlier, Alex, which has really sparked my interest.
[01:20:51.545 --> 01:20:56.025]   I know a lot of our Australian viewers would be very, very grateful for this.
[01:20:56.047 --> 01:21:04.171]  You said that you're willing to go to the Australian Embassy in Washington and do some kind of a political protest.
[01:21:04.712 --> 01:21:13.236]  Now, I just want to underscore, and I'm sure Monica would agree with me here, and so would millions of Australians who are going to be watching this, that is such a great thing.
[01:21:13.516 --> 01:21:15.197]  That is exactly what we need.
[01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:27.297]   We need For our friends and our allies overseas, especially the Americans who are very close to Australia, to point the finger at the Australian government and say, no, this is wrong.
[01:21:27.577 --> 01:21:28.798]  What you're doing is wrong.
[01:21:29.378 --> 01:21:34.582]  It's against all the values of Western civilization.
[01:21:34.962 --> 01:21:36.163]  It's against Christian values.
[01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:39.645]  It's against the basic principles of freedom and human rights.
[01:21:41.479 --> 01:21:57.648]  Just maybe a counter question to you, if you could take this opportunity to evaluate, and obviously there'll be many other millions of Americans who potentially could visit the Australian Embassy, visit the Australian Consulate, you know, bring the American flags, bring whatever, Aussie flags, bring signs.
[01:21:57.868 --> 01:21:58.909]  We would love to see that.
[01:21:59.169 --> 01:21:59.709]  Absolutely.
[01:21:59.729 --> 01:22:02.030]  Well, I mean, when I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it.
[01:22:02.931 --> 01:22:04.992]  And it may take a couple of weeks because I want to build this up.
[01:22:05.092 --> 01:22:05.953]  I may go to New York.
[01:22:05.973 --> 01:22:15.745]   You know, I thought about going and protesting because Bolsonaro said I could interview him In Brazil, and then I didn't think, oh, he's there, I should have gone and interviewed him, but I was in D.C.
[01:22:16.086 --> 01:22:29.910]  for the January 6th protesters that are a bunch of non-violence, still held in solitary confinement, and so I didn't go to that, but I could either, we could have a protest at the U.N., and there's also an Australian consulate, I know, in New York, or we could do the one in D.C.
[01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:47.319]   or do both, but yeah, we need to get everybody out to do that, because that's something the press is going to cover, and they're watching and testing again, In Australia and in the 50th state of Hawaii, as well, is under a very draconian system.
[01:22:47.539 --> 01:22:49.660]  So they love islands because you have nowhere to run.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.802]  Name and shame.
[01:22:51.822 --> 01:22:54.604]  There are two people that need to be named and shamed.
[01:22:54.784 --> 01:22:55.925]  It's Gladys Berejiklian.
[01:22:56.345 --> 01:22:57.646]  We call her Gulag Gladys.
[01:22:58.226 --> 01:22:59.387]  And it's Dan Andrews.
[01:22:59.467 --> 01:23:00.788]  We call him Dictator Dan.
[01:23:01.428 --> 01:23:07.432]  Now these are the premiers of the states of Victoria and New South Wales, states that have effectively become police states.
[01:23:10.578 --> 01:23:15.642]  Our American friends and Alex, if you're going to do this, we would really appreciate it.
[01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:20.286]  And name and shame these two people, Gladys Berejiklian and Dan Andrews.
[01:23:21.046 --> 01:23:23.248]  We really need the international community to step up here.
[01:23:23.388 --> 01:23:26.831]  Look, Australia has been helping countries all around the world.
[01:23:26.991 --> 01:23:28.392]  Our troops have been going overseas.
[01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:34.797]  Australia's been, you know, donating money and aid and, you know, for all sorts of natural disasters and so forth.
[01:23:35.037 --> 01:23:36.378]  Australia's never really asked for help.
[01:23:36.854 --> 01:23:39.175]  You know, the Australian people right now.
[01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:42.757]  Sir, you're under globalist New World Order takeover.
[01:23:42.937 --> 01:23:44.197]  It's a scientific test.
[01:23:44.257 --> 01:23:45.038]  You are us.
[01:23:45.418 --> 01:23:48.319]  You're like part of our heart or arm and we are yours.
[01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:51.961]  They're attacking me right now when they attack you and when they threw Ms.
[01:23:52.941 --> 01:23:55.762]  Schmidt into that gulag.
[01:23:56.002 --> 01:23:56.923]  Can you speak to that?
[01:23:58.004 --> 01:24:05.466]  So that people understand, Monica, what's happening and other facets, other things you'd like to impart to people, because they want you silenced.
[01:24:05.826 --> 01:24:07.667]  And big tech silences people.
[01:24:07.727 --> 01:24:08.847]  You can't be heard online.
[01:24:09.147 --> 01:24:10.167]  Then they put you in jail.
[01:24:10.448 --> 01:24:13.288]  They physically attack you so you can't speak out in the public.
[01:24:13.328 --> 01:24:20.610]  I mean, they've got you in a vice grip to say small businesses are not essential, to bankrupt them, to vertically integrate and take over the economy.
[01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:22.251]  I mean, this is economic war.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:25.062]  That's right.
[01:24:25.183 --> 01:24:26.488]  And this is only the beginning.
[01:24:26.789 --> 01:24:27.833]  They've been putting people...
[01:24:28.955 --> 01:24:31.376]  On incitement charges for a year.
[01:24:31.396 --> 01:24:34.958]  So this has been their tactic to actually silence people who have a platform.
[01:24:35.018 --> 01:24:37.339]  So you would have heard of Craig Kelly as well.
[01:24:37.919 --> 01:24:40.120]  He's a political member of Parliament.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.400]  He was taken off Facebook.
[01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:44.041]  He gets slammed in the media all the time.
[01:24:44.061 --> 01:24:45.342]  So this is just the beginning.
[01:24:45.922 --> 01:24:52.865]  They're trying to obviously stop people from speaking out of fear that they will get treated really badly from the media and so forth.
[01:24:52.905 --> 01:24:56.987]  And then, of course, with the protests as the days went on, the police got more and more brutal.
[01:24:57.167 --> 01:24:59.407]  seemingly to try and scare people.
[01:24:59.407 --> 01:25:03.646]   So this is just the beginning and tyrants don't negotiate, they just get harder.
[01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:06.446]  So it is gonna get harder, this is not the end at all.
[01:25:06.446 --> 01:25:12.327]   So anything America can do would be absolutely fantastic because I don't know, maybe some people
[01:25:12.327 --> 01:25:14.167]  are gonna have to die for this.
[01:25:14.167 --> 01:25:16.546]  It's getting really serious here.
[01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:20.146]   The protesting is very violent and it's not coming from the people,
[01:25:20.146 --> 01:25:21.587]  it's coming from the police.
[01:25:21.587 --> 01:25:24.807]  But the people have to defend themselves as well.
[01:25:24.807 --> 01:25:26.927]  So it's a very difficult situation here.
[01:25:26.927 --> 01:25:34.846]   And I would love to be able to stop that from happening, escalating into actual death and things like that.
[01:25:34.846 --> 01:25:38.246]   But it's heading that way, unfortunately, but I don't want it to.
[01:25:38.246 --> 01:25:40.286]  So if America can do something to help us.
[01:25:40.462 --> 01:25:44.766]  That would be fantastic because we are definitely drowning here and there's lots of positive things.
[01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:46.748]  There's lots of legal battles that are going on.
[01:25:46.768 --> 01:25:54.434]  We have a massive legal fund and we're actually going to be helping people like that 70 year old grandma who got wrestled to the ground and pepper sprayed and things like that.
[01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:57.977]  So there's also teachers unions that are being formed.
[01:25:57.997 --> 01:26:24.716]   10,000 teachers have already joined a union that don't want to get I totally understand, but what's going to happen is, I've read the UN plan and I'm sure you have, they're going to get 60-70% done, then they're going to organize them against you and say that you're making them sick and that's why their vaccines don't work, which is preposterous, and then they're going to try to put you in camps and persecute you.
[01:26:25.576 --> 01:26:27.598]  The same thing's being set up in Canada, the U.S.
[01:26:27.618 --> 01:26:32.101]  We have the CDC documents where they say when the unvaccinated, this is a year ago, don't take it.
[01:26:32.681 --> 01:26:34.963]  They're going to cause the variants, which isn't true.
[01:26:35.003 --> 01:26:35.824]  They're going to arrest us.
[01:26:35.864 --> 01:26:41.267]  So they're trying to organize a classically authoritarian model like we saw with Hitler.
[01:26:42.088 --> 01:26:44.810]  But instead, it's the unvaxxed are the new Jews.
[01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:47.211]  And it's about population control.
[01:26:47.292 --> 01:26:48.032]  It's about all that.
[01:26:48.873 --> 01:26:53.916]  And so that's what people need to understand is this is extremely evil, extremely draconian.
[01:26:54.536 --> 01:26:59.019]  And the fools that are getting the shots, they're going to be just as big as slaves as everybody else.
[01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:01.121]  Now they're like, oh, you need three, four, five shots.
[01:27:01.461 --> 01:27:04.363]  Oh, you need a microchip under your skin, says Klaus Schwab.
[01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:07.525]  So as crazy as all this sounds, this is Klaus Schwab.
[01:27:07.565 --> 01:27:08.706]  This is the corporate rulers.
[01:27:09.046 --> 01:27:11.448]  This is John Kerry saying, we're going to implement this.
[01:27:12.048 --> 01:27:22.515]  I mean, if you go to Klaus Schwab's own Wikipedia and scroll down, it says he has successfully captured the national governments of the world with his stakeholders so that there's no more democracy.
[01:27:22.555 --> 01:27:22.935]  There it is.
[01:27:23.276 --> 01:27:25.417]  Capture of democratic structures and institutions.
[01:27:25.897 --> 01:27:27.519]  And that links to his own site.
[01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:30.361]  So, I've read all four of his books.
[01:27:30.801 --> 01:27:31.902]  He ran the Bilderberg Group.
[01:27:32.082 --> 01:27:33.162]  He's a real Bond villain.
[01:27:33.503 --> 01:27:35.064]  He represents all the big families.
[01:27:35.444 --> 01:27:38.786]  The Royal Money, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers that set up the UN.
[01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:40.427]  And this is their move.
[01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:44.341]  Australia is in the jaws of the new world order.
[01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:49.084]  When it's done digesting them, it's going to shed its skin and it's already coming for us.
[01:27:49.584 --> 01:27:56.449]  Uh, I want to comment on that, uh, or, or add, I'm gonna give you both five, 10 minutes a piece, however much time you want.
[01:27:56.469 --> 01:28:01.012]  Then we're going to let you get some shut eye before the sun rises there in your once free country.
[01:28:01.473 --> 01:28:02.013]  Uh, so sad.
[01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:08.297]  So Simon Boykov, and then of course, uh, Monica Schmidt, I'm going to give you both about 10 minutes or however long you want Simon.
[01:28:09.838 --> 01:28:10.619]  Yeah, definitely that.
[01:28:11.412 --> 01:28:17.875]  It's the battle for Australia, but it's a battle for Australia in a broader sense.
[01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:21.397]  The whole world should be involved.
[01:28:21.617 --> 01:28:22.697]  The whole world should be watching.
[01:28:23.177 --> 01:28:42.527]   If Australia falls, if Australia is unable to defend itself, I'm talking about the Australian people, if we're overwhelmed by this campaign against the people, well it's going to be very easy then, or easier, You know, Canada's next, United States next, United Kingdom's next.
[01:28:43.388 --> 01:28:53.154]  So we really, really would welcome all forms of support and help from our allies, not only from the United States, from all other countries around the world.
[01:28:53.875 --> 01:29:01.519]  Now, when we talk about Australian embassies and Australian consulates, I have to underscore, you know, please don't commit any violent acts.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.521]  And, you know, we don't want to be seen to inciting violence.
[01:29:04.581 --> 01:29:13.432]   The police and the intelligence agencies in Australia, they're just dreaming You know, waiting for somebody like me to say something about incitement.
[01:29:13.692 --> 01:29:14.593]  Look what happened to Monica.
[01:29:14.973 --> 01:29:16.713]  You know, she didn't even sign anything, they arrested her.
[01:29:16.913 --> 01:29:20.794]  The only people that are inciting violence in Australia are the police themselves.
[01:29:21.374 --> 01:29:33.238]  The police themselves are antagonising citizens, are provocating citizens, and the police are dreaming and waiting for a violent event to occur as a false flag event, so then they can come in and crush the population.
[01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:38.179]  We've got military staying in five-star hotels in the centre of Sydney.
[01:29:38.857 --> 01:29:43.741]  The Marriott Hotel in the centre of Sydney, there are 590 rooms.
[01:29:43.861 --> 01:29:46.723]  The rooms cost about $500 or $600 a night.
[01:29:47.464 --> 01:29:48.324]  It's full of military.
[01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.766]  What are the military doing in the centre of the city?
[01:29:51.306 --> 01:29:53.548]  There are military units stationed all around Sydney.
[01:29:54.129 --> 01:29:56.430]  Now, obviously they're preparing for something.
[01:29:56.851 --> 01:30:00.954]  The Australian people, they're defenceless.
[01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:02.435]  They don't have any guns.
[01:30:02.455 --> 01:30:04.276]  I was served with a firearms prohibition order.
[01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:10.822]   I don't even have a firearm on the basis that They discovered some material or photo years ago in Russia.
[01:30:10.842 --> 01:30:11.923]  I was holding a Kalashnikov.
[01:30:13.544 --> 01:30:14.804]  There's nothing illegal about that.
[01:30:15.185 --> 01:30:16.485]  It's called a political campaign.
[01:30:16.505 --> 01:30:18.306]  They're silencing all political opposition.
[01:30:18.707 --> 01:30:20.227]  They're silencing opposition leaders.
[01:30:20.508 --> 01:30:21.728]  They're silencing journalists.
[01:30:22.429 --> 01:30:24.690]  And the mainstream media is even getting silenced.
[01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:32.038]   Just last week, during the Melbourne protests, The media air choppers were all grounded.
[01:30:32.478 --> 01:30:38.442]  The police enforced a no-fly zone over their own city to ground the media helicopters.
[01:30:39.203 --> 01:30:43.365]  And even the mainstream media took that all the way and made a formal complaint.
[01:30:43.926 --> 01:30:46.648]  So we're definitely at the barricades.
[01:30:47.568 --> 01:30:49.610]  The Eureka flag is flying proudly.
[01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:54.513]  Aussies are going into fight for their freedoms.
[01:30:55.299 --> 01:31:06.525]  Under the Eureka flag once again, which in 1854 became a famous flag of the Southern Cross, where there was a rebellion against the government, and that was really the birth of Australian democracy.
[01:31:07.086 --> 01:31:14.069]  Now our Prime Minister, the Honourable Scott Morrison, says that freedom is worth fighting for, but he was talking about freedom in Afghanistan.
[01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:16.151]  He wasn't talking about freedom in Australia.
[01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:27.985]   You know, Scott Morrison thinks it's okay to fight for freedom overseas, but he doesn't see that the people in Sydney, the people in Melbourne, They need protection from the tyranny, from the police.
[01:31:28.605 --> 01:31:30.886]  It's completely out of control what's happening here.
[01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:33.286]  And I can't repeat myself enough.
[01:31:33.987 --> 01:31:35.107]  We need support.
[01:31:35.127 --> 01:31:36.027]  We need an SOS.
[01:31:36.387 --> 01:31:40.969]  Now, we're not asking for America to send troops or invade us or, you know, other countries to invade us.
[01:31:41.769 --> 01:31:43.429]  Let's try a political method.
[01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:44.670]  Let's try to put pressure.
[01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:47.271]  I really like the idea, Alex.
[01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:48.411]  It was your idea.
[01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:49.071]  It wasn't my idea.
[01:31:49.091 --> 01:31:50.832]  Let's get that on the record, just in case.
[01:31:51.492 --> 01:31:52.312]  I love your idea.
[01:31:52.941 --> 01:32:04.966]  And if that happens, if you're going to go to the embassy and there's going to be other Americans that are able to apply, you know, democratic pressure or political pressure or in the UN and so forth, it's about time Australia gets criticized.
[01:32:05.446 --> 01:32:10.928]  You know, Australia was always the first to point the finger at Syria or Libya or China or Russia.
[01:32:10.948 --> 01:32:15.610]  You know, they were always the first to point the finger at Vladimir Putin and say, oh, look what he's doing over there.
[01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:20.972]  Well, unfortunately, Australia has now forever lost the moral high ground.
[01:32:21.678 --> 01:32:29.441]  Australia can no longer go out on the international arena and criticise other countries for human rights abuses.
[01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:41.205]  The Australian Foreign Minister, the Australian Prime Minister, no longer have the right, the moral right, to stand at the UN in front of all the other member countries and criticise them.
[01:32:43.507 --> 01:33:05.820]  Absolutely and you know I'm glad that you raised that point that this is like Tiananmen Square happening and now China gets to even criticize Australia that was once an open free country as you said since people stood up for themselves back in the 50s and kind of threw off the last vestiges of the old penal colony and so that's really really important that this has happened.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:16.170]   Why has your government, Simon in closing, so shamefully Well, can I say that I think the government has covertly been preparing for this for many years.
[01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.571]  They've been breaking down the family unit.
[01:33:17.611 --> 01:33:21.953]  They've been breaking down the traditional roles of men and the traditional roles of women.
[01:33:21.773 --> 01:33:42.012]  while they do it.
[01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:47.695]  They've been coercing the population to not be patriotic.
[01:33:48.476 --> 01:33:52.739]  Other agendas have been forced on the population.
[01:33:52.779 --> 01:33:55.381]  I don't want to say what they are, but I think everybody can guess.
[01:33:56.041 --> 01:33:58.243]  But, you know, religion has been pushed away.
[01:33:58.803 --> 01:34:00.144]  Patriotism has been pushed away.
[01:34:00.982 --> 01:34:06.844]  And at the moment, we're seeing a revival, a resurge of Australian patriotism.
[01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:08.405]  And that is really great.
[01:34:08.505 --> 01:34:12.386]  Our country, a great country of Australia, was formed, founded as a penal colony.
[01:34:12.986 --> 01:34:20.188]  And throughout our history, police intimidation has actually played a very important role in forming what Australia is now today.
[01:34:20.409 --> 01:34:27.872]   For example, our unofficial Australian anthem, Waltzing Matilda, There's actually a song about police intimidation.
[01:34:28.192 --> 01:34:34.833]  And the hero of the song is an Aussie battler who is under attack from police.
[01:34:35.493 --> 01:34:42.995]  So, you know, deep within the, you know, dark, very dark history of Australia, there's all sorts of examples of police intimidation.
[01:34:43.195 --> 01:34:56.565]   And it's worth noting that the Aboriginal people, the rightful custodians of the Australian continent, Absolutely.
[01:34:56.605 --> 01:34:57.565]  Let me throw this out.
[01:34:57.585 --> 01:34:59.246]  Because what you say is key.
[01:34:59.306 --> 01:35:00.827]  Klaus Schwab admits what he's doing.
[01:35:00.887 --> 01:35:02.928]  We got IMF World Bank documents in 2002.
[01:35:03.489 --> 01:35:04.409]  Greg Powell is the BBC.
[01:35:04.429 --> 01:35:06.270]  Came on the show with them back when the BBC was still better.
[01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:07.511]  Did some good work.
[01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:17.784]  And it was a plan using liberal, conservative, famine, war, whatever they would use to destabilize a country for up to a decade to get everybody to finally burn down the government and burn down the buildings.
[01:35:18.124 --> 01:35:25.986]  And the IMF and World Bank comes in as the saviors, and half the police state goes away, but they keep the real ones still in place.
[01:35:26.606 --> 01:35:31.548]  But the country's collapsed, so they buy everything up for pennies on the dollar, and they get rid of the middle class.
[01:35:32.478 --> 01:35:34.039]  And so that's what they're doing here.
[01:35:34.419 --> 01:35:37.001]  It's like a bullshit revolution mixed with a corporate takeover.
[01:35:37.321 --> 01:35:45.126]  And that's why they're trying to demoralize you, make you depressed, break your will, and do all of this so you then blame the Australian government.
[01:35:45.586 --> 01:35:49.469]  It's key to punish those and bring them to justice and take your government back and all of that.
[01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:55.852]  And stop the permanent dictatorship they're putting in, but realize that was an outside globalist force that did this.
[01:35:55.892 --> 01:36:00.494]  It will then bring you together for your nationalism instead of you hating your country.
[01:36:00.534 --> 01:36:05.916]  So Schwab writes articles how they're going to do this and make you angry and make you overthrow your government.
[01:36:06.517 --> 01:36:07.297]  This is their plan.
[01:36:07.337 --> 01:36:12.079]  So it's sophisticated at one level, but if you're aware of the scam, it's easy to stop.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.881]  So Simon, how do people find you and how do people get involved?
[01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:21.905]   And then I'm going to have some A closing time with our other guests that you were kind enough to put us in contact with.
[01:36:23.646 --> 01:36:24.527]  It's my pleasure.
[01:36:24.947 --> 01:36:28.990]  Monica Smith is the face of Australian democracy at the moment.
[01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:31.772]  A democracy that's under attack, that's in prison.
[01:36:32.233 --> 01:36:33.614]  And it's very fitting that she's a woman.
[01:36:35.095 --> 01:36:38.197]  Men must stand up for people like Monica Smith.
[01:36:39.118 --> 01:36:50.199]   To get in contact, to support, you can go to her website, RegNite Democracy, my YouTube page, the Aussie Cossack channel, The page started, just out of the blue, we started filming the police.
[01:36:50.219 --> 01:36:55.121]  Now there's a trending phrase all over Australia, FTP, film the police.
[01:36:55.541 --> 01:37:09.165]  Now the police, when they're filmed, they really don't like it, but that's the best way for us at the moment to counter police intimidation tactics, is to film them and put the footage up, so there's, you know, more than 50 videos have gone up on the Aussie Cossack YouTube channel.
[01:37:09.565 --> 01:37:13.227]  And the counter to the censorship is, what's the counter to the censorship?
[01:37:13.607 --> 01:37:14.127]  Everybody.
[01:37:14.927 --> 01:37:15.507]  More the merrier.
[01:37:15.547 --> 01:37:19.248]  More people need to go out and film, start a YouTube channel, start a Twitter, start a Band.Video.
[01:37:19.848 --> 01:37:28.070]  Ossie Kozak, I want to offer you, and we'll have Rob Ducolle here send you an email, I want to give you a Band.Video channel we bring great reporters on, and you can upload.
[01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:30.911]  We won't censor you, and it reaches a lot of people.
[01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:32.191]  You can promote your YouTube channel.
[01:37:32.491 --> 01:37:39.473]  And I also want to give a YouTube channel to the lady that you brought on, Monica Schmidt, because it's important to have other venues.
[01:37:39.513 --> 01:37:42.394]  And if you don't want it, that's fine, but it'll get a lot of views.
[01:37:42.934 --> 01:37:48.397]  It'll be a outpost that Australians can get in case you guys get censored because that is intensifying.
[01:37:48.437 --> 01:37:49.878]  So let's stay in contact.
[01:37:49.918 --> 01:37:52.319]  You're both wartime correspondents.
[01:37:52.379 --> 01:37:57.301]  If I can sponsor you some and hopefully help you get a film crew to send you out to show this.
[01:37:57.341 --> 01:38:02.064]  I don't want you to get arrested, but if you just say you're neutral press, that gives you even more protections.
[01:38:02.124 --> 01:38:06.506]  And I think, you know, as neutral press, you're allowed to have your free ideas that you don't want to live.
[01:38:06.626 --> 01:38:11.626]  in the Pacific area of North Korea as New North Korea.
[01:38:11.626 --> 01:38:14.824]  So we'll talk to you soon and thank you so much, Simon.
[01:38:14.824 --> 01:38:16.626]  There goes Simon Boykov.
[01:38:16.626 --> 01:38:17.626]  Thank you so much.
[01:38:17.626 --> 01:38:19.725]  Thank you Alex.
[01:38:19.725 --> 01:38:21.926]  All right, now going to final comments.
[01:38:21.926 --> 01:38:23.426]  Take as much time as you like.
[01:38:23.426 --> 01:38:26.626]   I was talking over you earlier and I'd like to put a promo out with you,
[01:38:26.626 --> 01:38:31.824]   you know, saying Monica Schmidt that same thing you said, they wanna break us, they're not gonna break us.
[01:38:31.452 --> 01:38:33.893]  And of course, I started interrupting like I do because I get so excited.
[01:38:34.273 --> 01:38:39.115]  Restate that for us and make any other great points you'd like to impart to several million people that are going to watch this.
[01:38:41.195 --> 01:38:41.455]  Sure.
[01:38:41.495 --> 01:38:42.696]  Well, thanks for the opportunity.
[01:38:42.756 --> 01:38:49.988]   So look, the tyranny and the violence from the police and the obvious draconian measures of the premiers are They're obvious.
[01:38:50.229 --> 01:39:01.536]  You know, you can see them in black and white, but it's really the underlying, what they really want to do is break our soul and break our minds, break our will, because then we're very easy to control.
[01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:03.177]  You know, it's like with the vaccine.
[01:39:03.217 --> 01:39:08.698]   If you don't want to take it, but you take it to go to cafes or to appease your government or to keep your
[01:39:08.698 --> 01:39:09.277]  job.
[01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:13.358]   You lose a little bit of your soul every single time you do something that you know is against
[01:39:13.358 --> 01:39:15.417]  your conviction basically.
[01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:20.377]   So every single method, every single thing that these premiers are doing are really designed
[01:39:20.377 --> 01:39:25.637]   to break our soul, just like an animal or a dog or like how they train elephants in
[01:39:25.637 --> 01:39:27.277]  those tourist countries.
[01:39:27.277 --> 01:39:28.637]  It's all just psychological.
[01:39:28.636 --> 01:39:39.199]  So for me, and what I realised in prison, and what I did with utilising my courage of conviction, is it actually beat them in that moment.
[01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:44.880]  They tried to silence me, and instead of silencing me, they actually made my voice international and bigger.
[01:39:44.941 --> 01:39:46.821]  So it actually did the exact opposite.
[01:39:47.221 --> 01:39:59.495]   So what I realised in prison, Alex, one of the biggest things I realised is that Collective courage of conviction is going to be the only way that the world is going to beat the agenda.
[01:39:59.775 --> 01:40:13.981]  Now obviously you've said the agenda is in full swing, it has been for decades and we are definitely behind the eight ball because we were all enjoying our lives and families and communities and not thinking this would happen in our lifetime and maybe a next generation would have to deal with it.
[01:40:14.361 --> 01:40:14.921]  But here it is.
[01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:18.143]  It's not our fault that it's here, but it is our fault to do something about it.
[01:40:18.503 --> 01:40:26.326]  And the only way that we can is to have our own individual courage of conviction in our own states in life, in our own lifestyles, with our own abilities.
[01:40:26.466 --> 01:40:27.527]  Everyone can do more.
[01:40:27.827 --> 01:40:28.567]  That's what I did.
[01:40:28.907 --> 01:40:29.768]  This is what you're doing.
[01:40:29.828 --> 01:40:32.249]  This is your role in the fight, Alex.
[01:40:32.369 --> 01:40:34.490]  And everyone has their own role, whether small or big.
[01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:42.043]   So for me, It's if you want to get them, you know, if you want to spite them, then have courage of conviction and just say no.
[01:40:42.183 --> 01:40:42.704]  And guess what?
[01:40:42.984 --> 01:40:43.564]  You'll love it.
[01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:47.865]  You'll feel super empowered and you'll become a better person for it and you will never look back.
[01:40:48.045 --> 01:40:50.106]  So that would be my last comment, Alex.
[01:40:51.086 --> 01:40:56.929]  Well, all I can say is, is it brings tears to my eyes hearing you talk about this because people are going on their lives.
[01:40:56.949 --> 01:40:57.709]  You can't blame them.
[01:40:57.949 --> 01:40:58.429]  You're good.
[01:40:58.489 --> 01:40:59.830]  You project your goodness on people.
[01:40:59.870 --> 01:41:01.990]  And then in comes ruthless corporations.
[01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:02.951]  We're all read about the UN.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.261]  Engineering the Rwandan massacre.
[01:41:06.301 --> 01:41:08.162]  They ran that, and then act like they're the saviors.
[01:41:08.182 --> 01:41:13.365]  But on record, international aid groups say, no, they came in and murdered a million people, and the Clintons were involved.
[01:41:14.065 --> 01:41:16.786]  And I see them doing stuff like that all over the world, and go, oh, the UN's good.
[01:41:17.187 --> 01:41:21.349]  All it is is a bunch of corporations that created it to carry out fascism worldwide.
[01:41:21.989 --> 01:41:24.310]  And now they're saying Communist China's the model.
[01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:27.432]  And just to see this is just horrific.
[01:41:27.492 --> 01:41:34.497]   And to watch the exact same tactics in Europe and in The UK and now in Canada and in blue cities in America.
[01:41:34.978 --> 01:41:37.820]  I mean, people need to wake up and say no.
[01:41:38.061 --> 01:41:43.226]  And just like Australia went from tyranny to liberty, now you're going back to your roots again because tyranny came back.
[01:41:43.426 --> 01:41:44.567]  It's the same thing in America.
[01:41:44.647 --> 01:41:47.610]  That's why certain cities they lock down, others they don't.
[01:41:47.851 --> 01:41:50.013]  Because cities they think that demographically will put up with it.
[01:41:50.393 --> 01:41:52.434]  You know, that have more people that didn't come from free countries, they do it.
[01:41:52.494 --> 01:41:57.318]  Areas they know are stocked with folks that can be of any color, but have a history of fighting for freedom, they don't do that.
[01:41:57.558 --> 01:42:01.681]  Because they've studied the anthropology, and they're studying us, they're seeing what we're doing.
[01:42:02.101 --> 01:42:04.743]  And I just really appreciate you coming on so late at night with us.
[01:42:05.263 --> 01:42:06.384]  How do people join you?
[01:42:06.424 --> 01:42:07.304]  How do they follow you?
[01:42:07.604 --> 01:42:11.367]  How do they find what you're doing and then boost and amplify what you're up to?
[01:42:11.387 --> 01:42:13.869]  And then tell us about the upcoming charges you face.
[01:42:14.069 --> 01:42:17.311]  I know you're out from the Supreme Court after 22 days, but what's coming next?
[01:42:18.749 --> 01:42:23.071]  Well, first I'd like to say I would definitely like to talk to your team about what you suggested.
[01:42:23.731 --> 01:42:30.374]  I already do reporting and journalism on the ground, although the police don't believe me, even though I've been all over the world doing journalism.
[01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:35.136]  They just don't believe me, so they arrest me anyway, even though I've got my proper permits.
[01:42:35.436 --> 01:42:38.397]  I have some court cases with the police already for false imprisonment.
[01:42:38.637 --> 01:42:43.917]   This isn't the first time I've been thrown into a sell for no reason. So I would love to talk to you about
[01:42:43.917 --> 01:42:49.216]   that but look my website is reignitedemocracyaustralia.com.au. It is safe,
[01:42:49.216 --> 01:42:53.337]   it isn't censored, it actually has a social media platform within it.
[01:42:53.337 --> 01:42:56.527]   We have a business directory as well so we're kind of creating a shadow
[01:42:56.527 --> 01:42:59.726]   economy in Australia which we don't really want to do but we have to because we
[01:42:59.726 --> 01:43:02.996]   don't know what's going to happen. So people can actually find like-minded
[01:43:02.996 --> 01:43:08.757]   businesses and I think this is a great idea for the rest of the world to take on.
[01:43:07.630 --> 01:43:10.232]  And your other question was, sorry, you asked me how to get in touch.
[01:43:11.013 --> 01:43:11.834]  Listen, I know this.
[01:43:11.874 --> 01:43:12.895]  What you just said is key.
[01:43:13.576 --> 01:43:18.701]  We need to create our own businesses or alliances where we support people that are into freedom.
[01:43:18.761 --> 01:43:24.768]   We'll become the most popular, and by free will, we will Still be free without having to fire a shot.
[01:43:25.028 --> 01:43:27.231]  And that's why they hate the free market and open societies.
[01:43:27.652 --> 01:43:29.754]  They call their tyranny an open society because it's the opposite.
[01:43:30.015 --> 01:43:35.983]  It's because by our simple action and our free will and free association, we can trump and override everything they're doing.
[01:43:37.463 --> 01:43:38.404]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:43:38.464 --> 01:43:46.711]  I think I really started to get the attention of the authorities when I started the business directory, because this is a feasible way to actually cut out the government.
[01:43:47.111 --> 01:43:53.537]  And also, I have over 100 community groups all over Australia, and a lot of those groups have more than 50 people within them.
[01:43:53.917 --> 01:43:59.342]  And they're all starting to plan their exit strategies if something was to go crazy, if there was a blackout or something like that.
[01:43:59.762 --> 01:44:07.787]  And I think a group of 50 people is surprisingly very, very powerful because every single person in that group has another 10 people, right?
[01:44:07.807 --> 01:44:09.808]  So that's- And you give each other moral authority.
[01:44:09.928 --> 01:44:10.269]  Absolutely.
[01:44:10.289 --> 01:44:11.049]  I want you to come back.
[01:44:11.069 --> 01:44:11.509]  That's right.
[01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:15.652]  And next time we can tape at night or something here, so it's early in the morning for you, not in the middle of the night.
[01:44:15.912 --> 01:44:17.513]  But that is, just to come on about solutions.
[01:44:18.073 --> 01:44:24.097]  A few more minutes about that, because yeah, the power of people and the power of while we still have some liberty, only supporting each other.
[01:44:24.137 --> 01:44:28.180]  That is so, because they're trying to isolate us, break us down, render us down to slaves.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.241]  Actually depopulate us later.
[01:44:30.281 --> 01:44:31.801]  As you said, they're planning a big blackout.
[01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:33.562]  That's the next thing Swab says they've got ready.
[01:44:33.602 --> 01:44:37.884]  I mean, folks, the more we give in, they're just positioning us for the next level of control.
[01:44:38.504 --> 01:44:42.125]  Talk about solutions and talk about how they wanted you to take your website down.
[01:44:42.165 --> 01:44:42.866]  That's key.
[01:44:43.126 --> 01:44:45.387]  It wasn't about you out there bullhorning.
[01:44:45.427 --> 01:44:46.507]  It wasn't about your demonstrating.
[01:44:46.527 --> 01:44:52.149]  It was about a articulate woman who's strong, standing up with free association.
[01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:53.270]  That's what scared them.
[01:44:54.577 --> 01:44:56.498]  It was very specific and targeted.
[01:44:57.058 --> 01:45:00.719]  You know, without sounding arrogant, I was becoming too effective and that was just a fact.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.420]  The subscribers are huge.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.182]  The campaigns that I do get thousands and thousands of reactions.
[01:45:07.822 --> 01:45:11.583]  We can do a lot and it's just too threatening for them.
[01:45:11.983 --> 01:45:20.226]  We also started a political party and just after starting that political party, they changed the registration numbers from 500 members to 1,500 members.
[01:45:21.867 --> 01:45:28.974]  So there's a lot of things being put in place to stop people like me, and there are other groups coming up as well, to gaining momentum.
[01:45:29.014 --> 01:45:36.640]  So Alex, imagine, you know, you can't travel more than five kilometres, you can't gather, you can't go interstate, you're censored.
[01:45:37.529 --> 01:45:39.910]  It's so hard to get a movement going.
[01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:45.813]  Imagine if we were able to do all those things, how much bigger the Reignite Democracy Australia movement would be.
[01:45:45.833 --> 01:45:49.194]  And that's why they say, don't talk to your neighbours.
[01:45:49.214 --> 01:45:51.815]  I mean, this is a cult, this is ridiculous.
[01:45:51.915 --> 01:46:00.779]  But in closing, when you first got on 45 minutes ago, you seemed to have a lot of faith though, and saying, hey, I believe in humanity, I see an awakening.
[01:46:00.819 --> 01:46:01.840]  That's what I see as well.
[01:46:03.641 --> 01:46:04.481]  You are optimistic?
[01:46:06.144 --> 01:46:07.885]  Yeah, I'm glad that you can see that.
[01:46:07.925 --> 01:46:13.566]  Yes, I've decided from the very beginning, Alex, to just be optimistic, even when it seems a little bit unrealistic.
[01:46:14.266 --> 01:46:15.587]  I just think that that's the best way.
[01:46:15.627 --> 01:46:18.548]  And that's how I haven't been broken with my will.
[01:46:18.588 --> 01:46:20.748]  And I think if everyone can do that, that would be fantastic.
[01:46:21.768 --> 01:46:23.449]  They can have the biggest plan that they want.
[01:46:23.885 --> 01:46:25.686]  Doesn't necessarily mean it's going to succeed.
[01:46:26.487 --> 01:46:33.891]  Collectively, if we keep doing these things and if everyone just did what they were capable of, the world would be a different place and we wouldn't even be here right now.
[01:46:34.231 --> 01:46:37.553]  But people doubt themselves, they doubt their courage and they doubt their power.
[01:46:37.894 --> 01:46:44.758]  But if every single person just reached in and just found a little bit more strength collectively, that would be a lot and a lot of strength.
[01:46:44.818 --> 01:46:49.981]  So I would just encourage people to do that and it will just make them a better person and it will help us win.
[01:46:50.001 --> 01:46:51.882]  Now, I'll finish on this quote.
[01:46:51.902 --> 01:46:52.923]  I'm sure you've heard it before.
[01:46:53.463 --> 01:46:54.685]  If not, who?
[01:46:55.185 --> 01:46:56.807]  If not, if not now, when?
[01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:58.388]  And if not you, who?
[01:46:58.409 --> 01:47:00.851]  It's been going on for far too long, Alex.
[01:47:00.951 --> 01:47:04.315]  If people aren't willing to stand up now, then you're actually kind of part of the problem.
[01:47:04.655 --> 01:47:09.800]  So change your mindset, become part of the solution, and we'll all be better off for it.
[01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:14.946]  And then if things do go badly, at least you won't be sitting there blaming yourself for not doing enough.
[01:47:15.226 --> 01:47:19.491]  Who wants to be sitting there in a gulag concentration camp thinking, I could have done more.
[01:47:19.792 --> 01:47:20.633]  I definitely don't.
[01:47:20.873 --> 01:47:21.974]  And I won't feel that way.
[01:47:22.014 --> 01:47:24.938]  And I don't want anyone that's listening right now to feel that way either.
[01:47:25.178 --> 01:47:31.726]  So now's the time, change your mindset, do more, watch less Netflix, but keep watching Alex Jones, of course.
[01:47:32.486 --> 01:47:42.369]  But watch less things that take time out of your day and do something to fight for our collective liberty as a country, as the world, and we will win.
[01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:43.770]  I believe we will win.
[01:47:43.810 --> 01:47:44.670]  Beautifully said.
[01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:45.330]  Thank you again.
[01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:48.071]  What time is it in your region of Australia right now?
[01:47:49.011 --> 01:47:50.712]  I think it's quarter past five.
[01:47:51.572 --> 01:47:53.313]  OK, so the birds are about to wake up.
[01:47:53.413 --> 01:47:53.633]  All right.
[01:47:53.653 --> 01:47:56.674]  Well, I hope to someday visit you when Australia is a free country.
[01:47:56.694 --> 01:47:57.714]  I always wanted to do it.
[01:47:58.095 --> 01:48:01.816]  I've just been so busy in the fight here knowing this was coming because it's in their own documents.
[01:48:01.836 --> 01:48:06.738]  I'm sure you've seen this, but Klaus Schwab says we've captured all the democracies, we've captured the countries.
[01:48:07.058 --> 01:48:09.999]  So he's diametrically opposed to your reignite democracy movement.
[01:48:10.399 --> 01:48:16.842]  So it should be quite easy if you just explain to people this is an outside force and everybody should duplicate what you're doing in their countries.
[01:48:17.222 --> 01:48:25.106]  Like Canada and blue cities in the US and Europe and should create these registries of people that stand free and open to band together their strength in that.
[01:48:25.487 --> 01:48:27.488]  All right, Monica, I really want to thank you.
[01:48:27.508 --> 01:48:29.069]  Congratulations on getting engaged.
[01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:30.149]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:48:30.209 --> 01:48:31.970]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:33.251]  Have a great day.
[01:48:33.531 --> 01:48:34.572]  Thank you, Monica Schmidt.
[01:48:34.672 --> 01:48:34.952]  Wow.
[01:48:35.652 --> 01:48:36.833]  That is a great woman.
[01:48:36.913 --> 01:48:38.274]  That is an engaged person.
[01:48:38.314 --> 01:48:39.375]  That is a beautiful soul.
[01:48:40.095 --> 01:48:43.257]  And so was Simon Boykov.
[01:48:43.377 --> 01:48:43.657]  All right.
[01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.118]  I'm going to go to a quick break.
[01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:48.124]  And that's just mind-blowing.
[01:48:50.049 --> 01:48:51.995]  The tyranny is horrible, but there's also the good rising.
[01:48:53.447 --> 01:48:56.489]  It energizes me, and that's why I get excited, and that's why you need to get excited.
[01:48:56.509 --> 01:48:59.090]  I know you're excited, but we need to get out of the trance, folks.
[01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:01.371]  And there she is at 5 a.m.
[01:49:01.391 --> 01:49:04.972]  in Australia, been up all day, all night, and she's still energized.
[01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.333]  I would not be at 5 a.m.
[01:49:06.353 --> 01:49:17.458]  when I've been up, but that's just amazing because she's been in a jail cell for 22 days because she created an alliance of businesses that are going to come together and say no to being told they're obsolete.
[01:49:17.998 --> 01:49:20.399]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:49:21.039 --> 01:49:21.979]  I am not obsolete.
[01:49:21.999 --> 01:49:29.421]  In fact, we'll go to the intro of The Twilight Zone of Invisible... It's not Invisible Man, it's The Obsolete Man, and then we will come back.
[01:49:29.481 --> 01:49:30.702]  Remember, I'm teleprompter-free, folks.
[01:49:31.042 --> 01:49:34.683]  All the other talk shows can look really slick and great because they got a teleprompter they're reading.
[01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:36.304]  No teleprompters here.
[01:49:36.824 --> 01:49:37.464]  Oh, the brain.
[01:49:38.064 --> 01:49:41.646]  So, uh, we'll play that clip from The Obsolete Man.
[01:49:41.666 --> 01:49:43.386]  I am not obsolete!
[01:49:43.566 --> 01:49:48.748]  And then we will come right back with a powerful conclusion with a key news blitz straight ahead.
[01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:54.971]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.
[01:49:55.751 --> 01:49:58.052]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:49:59.213 --> 01:50:00.293]  This is not a new world.
[01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:04.695]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:50:05.851 --> 01:50:13.337]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:50:14.278 --> 01:50:21.203]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:50:22.344 --> 01:50:26.948]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:50:28.069 --> 01:50:30.291]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:50:34.667 --> 01:50:36.568]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:50:37.028 --> 01:50:37.488]  A lie!
[01:50:37.929 --> 01:50:39.629]  No man is obsolete!
[01:50:39.929 --> 01:50:41.750]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:44.712]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:50:45.032 --> 01:50:50.114]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:50:50.494 --> 01:50:52.135]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:50:52.175 --> 01:50:53.276]  A crawling insect!
[01:50:53.676 --> 01:50:57.778]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:50:58.338 --> 01:50:59.439]  I am a human being!
[01:50:59.859 --> 01:51:02.280]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:51:03.032 --> 01:51:12.396]  You're a dealer in books and two-cent fines and pamphlets and clothes stacks and the musty insides of a language factory that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[01:51:12.757 --> 01:51:25.462]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind, like a vacuum that you make believe has an existence by scribbling index numbers on little cards.
[01:51:26.023 --> 01:51:26.683]  I don't care.
[01:51:26.703 --> 01:51:28.124]  I tell you, I don't care.
[01:51:28.144 --> 01:51:29.584]  I'm a human being.
[01:51:29.744 --> 01:51:30.265]  I exist.
[01:51:31.288 --> 01:51:36.950]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:40.151]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:51:40.611 --> 01:51:45.013]  Delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink!
[01:51:45.413 --> 01:51:47.893]  The narcotics that you call literature!
[01:51:48.174 --> 01:51:49.154]  The Bible!
[01:51:49.634 --> 01:51:50.414]  Poetry!
[01:51:50.794 --> 01:51:52.134]  Essays of all kind!
[01:51:52.274 --> 01:51:52.635]  All of it!
[01:51:52.655 --> 01:51:53.355]  An opiate!
[01:51:53.595 --> 01:51:57.435]  To make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:51:57.715 --> 01:52:00.256]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[01:52:00.456 --> 01:52:03.416]  and the state has no use for your kind.
[01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:13.416]   You waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[01:52:14.078 --> 01:52:14.858]  Instruct him!
[01:52:15.518 --> 01:52:18.839]  Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board.
[01:52:20.204 --> 01:52:21.204]  Yes.
[01:52:21.204 --> 01:52:31.204]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:52:31.204 --> 01:52:33.883]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:34.551]  Obsolete.
[01:52:36.772 --> 01:52:37.513]  Obsolete.
[01:52:37.633 --> 01:52:38.393]  I concur.
[01:52:40.014 --> 01:52:41.775]  Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[01:52:44.837 --> 01:52:48.196]  The board finds you obsolete.
[01:52:48.196 --> 01:52:57.397]  [static]
[01:52:57.397 --> 01:53:02.277]   I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:53:02.422 --> 01:53:04.203]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:53:04.483 --> 01:53:09.445]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:53:09.965 --> 01:53:10.606]  But we failed.
[01:53:11.066 --> 01:53:12.286]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:53:12.707 --> 01:53:14.247]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:20.190]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:28.996]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:53:29.517 --> 01:53:34.681]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:53:34.701 --> 01:53:37.383]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality storable food.
[01:53:37.603 --> 01:53:40.445]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[01:53:40.845 --> 01:53:42.986]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[01:53:43.006 --> 01:53:44.426]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[01:53:44.446 --> 01:53:46.507]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[01:53:46.327 --> 01:53:47.927]  ready to ship right now.
[01:53:47.927 --> 01:53:52.847]   Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines in wait,
[01:53:52.847 --> 01:53:55.166]  because believe me, serious times are coming.

[01:53:57.447 --> 01:54:00.327]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[01:54:00.327 --> 01:54:03.287]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[01:54:03.287 --> 01:54:06.327]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[01:54:06.327 --> 01:54:10.646]   We may end it earlier, 'cause we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[01:54:10.646 --> 01:54:12.525]  Vitamin Refusion, super popular.
[01:54:12.616 --> 01:54:15.197]  It's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[01:54:15.517 --> 01:54:17.037]  Great amino acids and it tastes great.
[01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:21.599]  It's powder form so in the water you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[01:54:22.019 --> 01:54:29.442]  Then we also have, back in stock, this sale will continue through next week, Knockout Sleep Aid with eight organic ingredients that help you sleep better.

[01:55:05.928 --> 01:55:07.068]  Maybe it's true, maybe it's not.
[01:55:07.088 --> 01:55:10.891]  But the point is, they just want the excuse to rule over you and depopulate you.
[01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:17.856]  Thank you for joining us on this live transmission, this Saturday emergency report.
[01:55:18.851 --> 01:55:22.673]  And after it's archived at Bandot Video, I hope you'll share it.
[01:55:22.693 --> 01:55:23.514]  I hope you'll fight back.
[01:55:23.574 --> 01:55:35.582]  I hope you'll join me in this epic struggle, because those who are asleep, those that are in a coma, think of going and speaking at the city council or the school board, or going and protesting for some foreign country under tyranny, whether it be Tibet or Australia.
[01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:43.006]  It's a hard labor, it's exhausting, it's a tyranny, but it's not, it's a liberty.
[01:55:43.807 --> 01:55:46.208]  And if not exercised, you will live under tyranny.
[01:55:46.228 --> 01:56:05.729]   I want to read to you From one of the great thinkers of the 20th century, who died early in the 21st century, Alexander Sholtsanitsyn, who spent decades in a camp and wished he wouldn't have just let them take him away.
[01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:29.012]   And how we burned in the camps later thinking What would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family, or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad,
[01:56:30.247 --> 01:56:57.100]  When they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hauling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose, and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand.
[01:56:58.254 --> 01:57:04.680]  The organs would have very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.762]  He means the agencies by organs.
[01:57:08.303 --> 01:57:23.437]  The organs would have very quickly suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if, if we didn't love freedom enough.
[01:57:24.966 --> 01:57:29.370]  And even more, we had no awareness of the real situation.
[01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:34.374]  We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterwards.
[01:57:36.555 --> 01:57:37.556]  I read that book when I was about 16.
[01:57:37.696 --> 01:57:40.519]  It gave me a headache because it's so well written and complex.
[01:57:41.219 --> 01:57:43.581]  But do you want to read about 20 years in a forced labor camp?
[01:57:46.584 --> 01:57:48.125]  Without even a jacket most of the time?
[01:57:52.503 --> 01:57:53.723]  The Gulag Archipelago, 1918-1956.
[01:57:53.923 --> 01:57:57.644]  That's the period that the book is written over.
[01:57:59.685 --> 01:58:06.685]  wrote it in his mind and then memorized it.
[01:58:06.685 --> 01:58:10.524]  Oh, that's just the Russians.
[01:58:10.567 --> 01:58:11.027]  That's there.
[01:58:11.067 --> 01:58:12.027]  That's how that's, you know, there.
[01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:16.148]  And you know, they were a bunch of hardworking Christian people.
[01:58:18.028 --> 01:58:19.729]  Almost no crime in Russia back then.
[01:58:19.749 --> 01:58:21.609]  Kind of like Japan.
[01:58:22.967 --> 01:58:26.008]  But boy, once they got taken over, it's been, it's been bad, right?
[01:58:26.048 --> 01:58:28.848]  Ever since now, the Russians are trying to get rid of all that.
[01:58:28.948 --> 01:58:31.229]  It's like getting a face sucker from the movie alien off of you.
[01:58:31.269 --> 01:58:38.891]  And old George Soros is so angry, but let me just in the interest of time this evening, because I went a few weeks ago, six and a half hours.
[01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:41.832]  And that really, uh, that's not right.
[01:58:41.852 --> 01:58:46.013]  My little four-year-old daughter that just begs daddy to come home and paint and play with her.
[01:58:46.053 --> 01:58:46.993]  And I will this evening.
[01:58:49.628 --> 01:58:54.231]  After we complete this transmission, but you know, it's okay because she doesn't have a future if I don't do this.
[01:58:55.411 --> 01:58:59.233]  And you don't have a future if you don't fight back because it's all a stated plan.
[01:58:59.273 --> 01:59:03.176]  I told you 20 months ago when this started, I said, it's never going to go away.
[01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:04.036]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:59:04.056 --> 01:59:04.656]  Please stop it.
[01:59:05.797 --> 01:59:07.538]  I let up because their whole plan's written down.
[01:59:07.578 --> 01:59:12.681]  That's, that's my biggest frustration is that's why I harp on this.
[01:59:12.961 --> 01:59:14.642]  And, and, and it, and it doesn't get to me.
[01:59:14.702 --> 01:59:17.363]  It gets to me because people are dumb and that's going to hurt them bad.
[01:59:17.584 --> 01:59:18.304]  Let's say they're ignorant.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:20.320]  I can send emails.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.661]  I see text messages to people.
[01:59:21.901 --> 01:59:22.721]  I see it all over Twitter.
[01:59:22.801 --> 01:59:23.621]  Everywhere I've been looking.
[01:59:24.141 --> 01:59:25.542]  Oh, Jones is one of them.
[01:59:25.942 --> 01:59:27.262]  That's how he knows all this.
[01:59:27.502 --> 01:59:27.943]  Oh, really?
[01:59:28.403 --> 01:59:35.085]  I go to the Wikipedia page and Klaus Schwab says he's going to capture our governments and control us where we don't have any rights.
[01:59:35.685 --> 01:59:36.845]  I mean, he says that on Wikipedia.
[01:59:36.865 --> 01:59:42.047]  Kind of like Hitler, you know, wrote Mein Kampf and said what he'd do.
[01:59:45.353 --> 01:59:47.974]  That's a cop out of these people that never get politically involved.
[01:59:47.994 --> 01:59:50.415]  They go, oh, no one could ever fix a government.
[01:59:50.435 --> 01:59:51.336]  They're all agents.
[01:59:51.696 --> 01:59:54.217]  Oh, oh, you know, it's true.
[01:59:54.237 --> 01:59:55.438]  They're the superior men.
[01:59:57.118 --> 01:59:57.919]  They never looked a finger.
[01:59:57.939 --> 02:00:02.141]  They just tell you everybody's an operative and the opposition and all this crap.
[02:00:03.821 --> 02:00:08.083]  No, see, I don't get told what to do by the CIA or the FBI or anybody.
[02:00:11.545 --> 02:00:14.086]  I help lead the opposition to all of that.
[02:00:14.966 --> 02:00:20.250]  And the people that are in there who aren't suicidal, listen to me and I influenced them.
[02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:22.372]  I influenced Bolsonaro.
[02:00:22.832 --> 02:00:24.073]  I influenced Joe Rogan.
[02:00:24.854 --> 02:00:26.255]  I influenced Tucker Carlson.
[02:00:26.695 --> 02:00:27.956]  I influenced Rush Limbaugh.
[02:00:28.417 --> 02:00:29.678]  I influenced Steve Bannon.
[02:00:30.178 --> 02:00:36.343]  I influenced Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich and the list goes on forever because I've been around longer than them.
[02:00:36.823 --> 02:00:41.767]  And I've had a big show for 25 years because God did that.
[02:00:41.787 --> 02:00:42.848]  It's not me.
[02:00:46.789 --> 02:00:49.630]  We did this, you did this, this audience supporting us.
[02:00:50.491 --> 02:00:51.771]  There is good in the universe.
[02:00:52.052 --> 02:00:53.352]  My daddy's a good man.
[02:00:53.732 --> 02:00:55.153]  My grandparents were good people.
[02:00:55.493 --> 02:00:56.834]  My mama's a good person.
[02:00:57.234 --> 02:00:58.114]  I'm a good person.
[02:00:58.635 --> 02:00:59.815]  This crew are good people.
[02:00:59.995 --> 02:01:01.556]  And you out there watching are good people.
[02:01:01.776 --> 02:01:06.819]  Don't you ever let these devils tell you there's nobody prominent and strong fighting.
[02:01:07.239 --> 02:01:07.759]  BS!
[02:01:07.899 --> 02:01:08.740]  You know you're good.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.880]  You know you love God.
[02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:13.682]  I'll say what I began to say at the start of the broadcast.
[02:01:14.798 --> 02:01:18.241]  And then I never got to my point, as I tend to do, because my mind meanders.
[02:01:18.261 --> 02:01:19.342]  There's not really any notes here.
[02:01:19.362 --> 02:01:22.324]  I wrote a few notes, but I wanted to ask the guests while they were talking.
[02:01:24.586 --> 02:01:25.587]  We're not just teleprompter free.
[02:01:25.607 --> 02:01:27.348]  We're notes free.
[02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:30.230]  It's all right here in my soul.
[02:01:31.131 --> 02:01:35.815]  And it's that these Saturday shows are very popular and they get millions of viewers.
[02:01:38.393 --> 02:01:39.934]  Because nobody's doing news on Saturday.
[02:01:39.954 --> 02:01:41.936]  There's a lot of hungry people for information on Saturday.
[02:01:41.956 --> 02:01:43.617]  So we're here because we're in the same boat as you.
[02:01:43.657 --> 02:01:44.157]  We want to fight.
[02:01:44.518 --> 02:01:44.998]  We want to win.
[02:01:45.018 --> 02:01:46.279]  We're energized by resistance.
[02:01:46.319 --> 02:01:46.979]  We love God.
[02:01:48.761 --> 02:01:54.485]  And I think about the average show just on freeworldnews.tv, banned on video.
[02:01:54.725 --> 02:01:56.046]  And then it gets derivative everywhere.
[02:01:56.106 --> 02:01:57.327]  And who knows, can we count it up?
[02:01:57.367 --> 02:02:00.189]  I did one day, spent like hours trying to figure it out a few months ago.
[02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:06.134]  And on our platforms, one of these shows gets seen about 2 million times within a day or so.
[02:02:08.334 --> 02:02:09.375]  On average, it's about 2 million.
[02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:10.695]  The lowest is a million.
[02:02:11.476 --> 02:02:12.376]  Sometimes it's 5 million.
[02:02:12.936 --> 02:02:14.237]  We've had some with 4 or 5 million.
[02:02:14.597 --> 02:02:15.338]  Just on our platform.
[02:02:15.818 --> 02:02:18.099]  And then I tried to track it in other places, which is incredible.
[02:02:18.119 --> 02:02:20.500]  It was hundreds of thousands, if not millions, on other channels.
[02:02:21.821 --> 02:02:27.364]  Now imagine a million people is 10 sports stadiums, the big ones, with 100,000 people.
[02:02:27.404 --> 02:02:34.307]  That's 10 sports stadiums of people will, by tomorrow morning, this will probably have, at Bandot Video, a million views.
[02:02:34.608 --> 02:02:37.168]  A million people that went, clicked on it and watched it.
[02:02:37.168 --> 02:02:45.328]  That's 10 sports stadiums.
[02:02:45.594 --> 02:02:46.794]  And that's just our Saturday show.
[02:02:46.854 --> 02:02:47.474]  That's you.
[02:02:47.814 --> 02:02:48.494]  You tuned in.
[02:02:48.534 --> 02:02:49.034]  You cared.
[02:02:49.254 --> 02:02:49.975]  You shared the link.
[02:02:50.015 --> 02:02:50.635]  You got involved.
[02:02:51.255 --> 02:02:56.796]  We, I mean, 10 football, a million people trained could militarily take this country over.
[02:02:57.056 --> 02:02:59.857]  Swalwell says, Oh, we'll just nuke you.
[02:03:01.357 --> 02:03:02.857]  That's not how nuclear weapons work.
[02:03:02.877 --> 02:03:04.738]  You kill your own people, your own infrastructure with that.
[02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:05.278]  No, no, no.
[02:03:05.558 --> 02:03:06.758]  And I don't want a military war.
[02:03:06.578 --> 02:03:09.678]   These guys don't even know about military or history and they want to
[02:03:09.678 --> 02:03:12.678]  spout off about it all day.
[02:03:12.678 --> 02:03:21.158]  What happens if you just block the highways?
[02:03:21.158 --> 02:03:24.158]  What was that?
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:26.504]  What would happen if a million of you went after the globalists?
[02:03:26.604 --> 02:03:27.485]  They'd all be gone.
[02:03:27.886 --> 02:03:29.548]  I mean, get on airplanes, go to the countries they're at.
[02:03:30.555 --> 02:03:31.256]  We're not going to do that.
[02:03:31.296 --> 02:03:31.956]  I'm not calling for that.
[02:03:32.116 --> 02:03:39.523]  But we have the power and they know it and they want to get us locked down and enslaved and poor so we don't have money to travel a mile outside where we live.
[02:03:39.743 --> 02:03:41.224]  They want us on the plantation.
[02:03:41.484 --> 02:03:44.887]  Not because we challenged them, but because they want to get rid of us.
[02:03:45.308 --> 02:03:47.830]  So now they're going to force us to go and defeat them.
[02:03:47.850 --> 02:03:48.911]  That's what evil always does.
[02:03:49.131 --> 02:03:53.134]  It could have sat there and still been in charge, but it wants to kill us too bad.
[02:03:54.856 --> 02:03:57.866]   So when I get up here and I say, Endgame.
[02:03:58.447 --> 02:03:59.747]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:03:59.827 --> 02:04:00.688]  They want you dead.
[02:04:00.948 --> 02:04:02.469]  That was the tagline for the film.
[02:04:04.050 --> 02:04:06.411]  And online ads, we ran on Google.
[02:04:07.172 --> 02:04:08.473]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars ads.
[02:04:08.513 --> 02:04:09.934]  Back in the time, we had stickers that said it.
[02:04:10.274 --> 02:04:10.714]  Endgame.
[02:04:10.834 --> 02:04:11.715]  They want you dead.
[02:04:12.055 --> 02:04:13.075]  You go to endgame.com.
[02:04:13.096 --> 02:04:14.016]  I know the site's still up.
[02:04:14.616 --> 02:04:16.097]  It's a bibliography of the film.
[02:04:17.698 --> 02:04:18.879]  It says, they want you dead.
[02:04:19.459 --> 02:04:20.400]  That's the tagline.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.541]  They want you dead.
[02:04:21.661 --> 02:04:22.061]  See now?
[02:04:22.101 --> 02:04:22.801]  They want you dead.
[02:04:22.861 --> 02:04:23.942]  I mean, let me just show you right here.
[02:04:24.963 --> 02:04:25.183]  Here's...
[02:04:26.530 --> 02:04:28.690]  Wall Street Journal looking forward to the end of humanity.
[02:04:29.090 --> 02:04:30.651]  Oh, we're a failed ugly species.
[02:04:30.931 --> 02:04:34.011]  COVID showed us we've got to just give up our bodies because we get sick.
[02:04:34.051 --> 02:04:34.771]  What does this crap mean?
[02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:37.032]  We're an incredible species on a beautiful planet.
[02:04:37.252 --> 02:04:39.172]  The moon, the gibbous moon was out this morning.
[02:04:39.472 --> 02:04:41.052]  Gorgeous in a pure blue sky.
[02:04:44.513 --> 02:04:50.854]  They package all their ugliness and all their slavery with robots running our lives and us owning and having nothing as a good thing.
[02:04:52.054 --> 02:04:53.154]  They want you dead.
[02:04:53.795 --> 02:04:55.555]  That's a 14 year old website.
[02:04:56.394 --> 02:04:58.335]  They want you dead!
[02:05:02.617 --> 02:05:05.999]  I want to update that site.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:09.961]  You know what?
[02:05:10.001 --> 02:05:12.021]  PrisonPlanet.com redirects.
[02:05:12.062 --> 02:05:12.982]  We stopped updating it.
[02:05:16.364 --> 02:05:17.244]  Command dot video.
[02:05:17.324 --> 02:05:20.966]  Let's redirect PrisonPlanet.com to end game.
[02:05:21.446 --> 02:05:22.346]  Please get that done, guys.
[02:05:22.366 --> 02:05:23.287]  Tell the IT people to do that.
[02:05:23.985 --> 02:05:26.947]  And then we're going to update that site with in-game two.
[02:05:27.027 --> 02:05:28.028]  I'm finally making it.
[02:05:28.108 --> 02:05:30.250]  It's going to be out in February of next year.
[02:05:31.311 --> 02:05:31.851]  Scouts honor.
[02:05:33.632 --> 02:05:33.993]  Okay.
[02:05:36.234 --> 02:05:41.018]  I got a lot of news and I've already gone a long time and I promised family I'd come meet with them.
[02:05:41.058 --> 02:05:45.561]  So let me race through this as quickly as I can.
[02:05:48.343 --> 02:05:54.110]   And then we will, uh, In this special transmission till I'm back tomorrow night, Lord willing, at 4pm central.
[02:05:54.171 --> 02:05:56.932]  I mean, every day above ground is a good day, so you never know what they're gonna pull.
[02:05:56.952 --> 02:05:57.532]  That's okay.
[02:05:57.672 --> 02:05:58.492]  I chose my path.
[02:05:59.572 --> 02:06:02.353]  And I'm right where I want to be, as they say.
[02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:04.414]  And so whatever happens, it's in God's hands.
[02:06:04.874 --> 02:06:08.736]  But we are potentially in the final days of even communications.
[02:06:09.376 --> 02:06:14.598]  I mean, if you think that what they launched is bad, that's that's gonna look like a walk in the park soon.
[02:06:17.352 --> 02:06:22.114]  I can only say that to get everybody in the system going along with this to realize you've signed your own death warrant.
[02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:23.494]  I don't mean in some war with us.
[02:06:23.554 --> 02:06:30.977]  I mean, you're going to be dying just like we are when they release the bioweapons that make this look like a slice of pumpkin pie.
[02:06:34.399 --> 02:06:35.359]  And you know it's going to happen.
[02:06:35.379 --> 02:06:36.119]  You know you're all dead.
[02:06:36.139 --> 02:06:37.920]  And you know you'll let your kids die.
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.781]  FBI, CIA, government.
[02:06:39.821 --> 02:06:40.181]  You love it.
[02:06:40.201 --> 02:06:41.321]  You were hired because you're bootlickers.
[02:06:41.581 --> 02:06:42.782]  You were hired because you groveled to the system.
[02:06:42.802 --> 02:06:43.682]  You were hired because you're weak.
[02:06:45.263 --> 02:06:48.142]   Maybe some of you Have some soul.
[02:06:48.162 --> 02:06:53.647]  Maybe you had somebody in your family that wasn't, you know, another sellout to Satan, but this stuff runs in family lines.
[02:06:53.667 --> 02:06:54.067]  We get it.
[02:06:54.648 --> 02:06:55.088]  We get it.
[02:06:55.829 --> 02:06:56.950]  You who you are, you can't help it.
[02:06:57.270 --> 02:07:01.675]  But those of us that do care about our children, we got to change this and turn this around.
[02:07:01.735 --> 02:07:05.298]  And I know there are a lot of good people actually in the government.
[02:07:05.478 --> 02:07:09.602]  So the government's not our enemy and the corporation's not our enemy, but it's the people at the top of the problem.
[02:07:09.622 --> 02:07:10.383]  But I am disgusted.
[02:07:12.093 --> 02:07:16.036]  Because I mean, I watched the globalists run around the world and kill whoever they wanted in third world countries.
[02:07:16.056 --> 02:07:17.697]  And now they're going to make us just like that.
[02:07:17.737 --> 02:07:19.859]  And they want us more than they want those third world populations.
[02:07:20.419 --> 02:07:21.500]  They just killed third worlders.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:22.040]  They don't even care.
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:23.141]  That's just getting them out of the way.
[02:07:23.161 --> 02:07:26.103]  They don't like successful, smart people.
[02:07:28.245 --> 02:07:33.949]  Just like in that Disney movie, Snow White, that's based on so many old German fables.
[02:07:34.570 --> 02:07:36.091]  Story's been told probably a hundred different ways.
[02:07:37.952 --> 02:07:38.992]  Hansel and Gretel, all of it.
[02:07:39.012 --> 02:07:40.393]  The witch wants the souls of children.
[02:07:40.413 --> 02:07:41.313]  They want to eat the children.
[02:07:41.333 --> 02:07:42.973]  They want to take the future.
[02:07:42.993 --> 02:07:44.054]  What do they want now?
[02:07:44.194 --> 02:07:44.774]  It's a spirit.
[02:07:45.254 --> 02:07:45.834]  It's an entity.
[02:07:46.134 --> 02:07:46.894]  Call her out of space.
[02:07:48.235 --> 02:07:49.295]  Like Lovecraft talked about.
[02:07:50.836 --> 02:07:56.837]  And mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?
[02:07:58.538 --> 02:08:03.099]  You are fair, my queen, but not as fair as the young maiden.
[02:08:05.532 --> 02:08:10.794]  Dark black hair and ruby red lips and skin as white as snow.
[02:08:10.814 --> 02:08:12.814]  I paraphrase.
[02:08:14.675 --> 02:08:16.515]  And so she takes on her true form.
[02:08:17.076 --> 02:08:17.676]  A witch!
[02:08:18.056 --> 02:08:21.517]  In the process of wanting to kill youth, she's no longer even beautiful.
[02:08:21.877 --> 02:08:24.798]  She transmits into what she didn't want to be.
[02:08:25.238 --> 02:08:27.879]  With a pleasant apple of knowledge.
[02:08:28.359 --> 02:08:31.740]  The archetype of the end of the childhood stolen.
[02:08:33.746 --> 02:08:38.768]  But what can save her from the deep sleep of the psychic poison, a prince?
[02:08:39.348 --> 02:08:42.109]  True love, men standing up and doing the right thing.
[02:08:46.411 --> 02:08:51.113]  And what kills the witch at the end is not the dwarves and not the huntsman.
[02:08:51.193 --> 02:08:53.094]  No, it's God.
[02:08:53.154 --> 02:08:54.554]  It's the lightning strike.
[02:08:59.176 --> 02:08:59.856]  Perfectly written.
[02:09:01.117 --> 02:09:01.817]  Perfectly true.
[02:09:03.407 --> 02:09:06.669]  And so all these people... Don't look at the sun!
[02:09:06.690 --> 02:09:06.730]  Ha!
[02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:07.950]  Don't talk to your neighbors!
[02:09:08.411 --> 02:09:09.812]  There'll be more shots forever!
[02:09:10.032 --> 02:09:11.753]  Just get used to it, my pretties!
[02:09:15.036 --> 02:09:15.856]  Ha ha ha!
[02:09:16.137 --> 02:09:17.738]  You patriots will die!
[02:09:18.499 --> 02:09:18.639]  Oh!
[02:09:18.699 --> 02:09:20.699]  Klaus Schwab!
[02:09:20.699 --> 02:09:29.699]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[02:09:29.699 --> 02:09:39.699]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:09:35.441 --> 02:09:38.143]  And who is it in the archetypes that defeats the evil?
[02:09:38.404 --> 02:09:39.905]  It's the little dwarves.
[02:09:39.965 --> 02:09:40.745]  It's the hobbits.
[02:09:40.826 --> 02:09:41.646]  It's the commoners.
[02:09:43.027 --> 02:09:45.189]  Who the establishment doesn't see?
[02:09:45.209 --> 02:09:48.752]  Oh, well, it's looking to stop Alex Jones or Donald Trump.
[02:09:48.792 --> 02:09:50.794]  It's you that'll defeat the new world order.
[02:09:51.254 --> 02:09:55.098]  It's you and the little things you do every day while evil overlooks you.
[02:09:55.518 --> 02:09:56.819]  Oh, but now it isn't overlooking you.
[02:09:56.839 --> 02:10:02.724]  It wants to get rid of all of you because it knows from you, the proletariat springs that which will defeat them every time.
[02:10:04.402 --> 02:10:06.402]  All right, let's hit the news here.
[02:10:06.402 --> 02:10:14.962]  I already said it, so I'll just recap it.
[02:10:15.155 --> 02:10:16.777]  The stories are all on Infowars.com.
[02:10:17.717 --> 02:10:21.040]  You notice the days before CNN, oh, Republican leaders say no proof.
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.361]  All these neocon warmongers that they're worshiping.
[02:10:23.942 --> 02:10:27.724]  Oh, nothing came out of Arizona because Arizona came out and just totally nailed it.
[02:10:28.265 --> 02:10:34.349]  Totally proved it with the facts that it was ballot manipulation yet again with all those extra ballots.
[02:10:34.369 --> 02:10:36.310]  The Democrats said, you're going to have a red mirage.
[02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:40.013]  It'll look like Trump wins, but we'll deliver enough ballots in the end to say he loses.
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:43.222]  And that's what they did all over the country.
[02:10:44.483 --> 02:10:51.770]  Everybody got red herringed with the machines and with really sophisticated operatives to go lie to people to manipulate them.
[02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:53.011]  And it's very, very sad.
[02:10:53.432 --> 02:10:54.773]  But Arizona did not take the bait.
[02:10:54.793 --> 02:10:56.775]  They got real experts in and they proved it all.
[02:10:58.096 --> 02:11:01.119]  Arizona audit finds Trump won state by large margin.
[02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:04.542]  Jamie White's got all the facts, all the factoids, all the videos, all the links, all the proof.
[02:11:04.582 --> 02:11:05.022]  It's right there.
[02:11:05.042 --> 02:11:06.384]  I just said it to everybody you know.
[02:11:08.203 --> 02:11:08.724]  Bombshell!
[02:11:08.804 --> 02:11:11.767]  AZ Audit team caught Maricopa County deleting election files.
[02:11:12.047 --> 02:11:17.213]  By the way, Trump won what he lost by in the state times five just in one county.
[02:11:18.475 --> 02:11:19.416]  You know what they were doing all over.
[02:11:21.618 --> 02:11:25.022]  AZ Audit finds proof of premeditated fraud, multiple ballot.
[02:11:25.931 --> 02:11:30.876]  Envelopes had verified an approved stamp that appears to be pre-printed behind a signature box.
[02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:33.338]  Several approved with no signature at all.
[02:11:33.658 --> 02:11:34.979]  It's just a smorgasbord.
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:45.108]  But the Republican governor does nothing because, oh, what the New York Times say, it's too destructive even if Trump did win to now go back.
[02:11:46.350 --> 02:11:47.330]  There's that article right here.
[02:11:47.971 --> 02:11:51.154]  Even if the election was stolen, recalling it will just further divide the country.
[02:11:53.157 --> 02:11:53.937]  And it goes on and on.
[02:11:53.997 --> 02:11:56.338]  Meanwhile, they want to divide the country.
[02:11:56.358 --> 02:11:57.599]  They want to dissolve its borders.
[02:11:57.919 --> 02:12:10.485]  They want to get the government controlled by them, and then they crash the government into us, and then we think the government's our enemy and burn it down, and the globalists just sit back and laugh instead of Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the UN and the New World Order pay for what they've done.
[02:12:11.045 --> 02:12:19.029]  Costco limits toilet paper, towels, and bottled water purchases over inflation supply chain breakdown.
[02:12:20.885 --> 02:12:22.566]  Now there is a supply chain breakdown.
[02:12:22.606 --> 02:12:24.226]  There is massive inflation happening.
[02:12:24.266 --> 02:12:24.987]  That's all true.
[02:12:25.287 --> 02:12:27.388]  But then it causes everybody to then surge.
[02:12:27.408 --> 02:12:31.830]  Like the UK government said, don't panic buy fuel and panic buy food.
[02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:32.850]  So everybody went and panicked and bought it.
[02:12:33.731 --> 02:12:40.313]  So they're creating the same thing we saw 18, 19, 20 months ago to create that same fear to wear the mask and get back into it in the fall.
[02:12:40.573 --> 02:12:46.236]  And it was a whole new ritual of lockdowns whenever they want, especially for the midterm elections next year.
[02:12:47.884 --> 02:12:50.726]  You also got the same thing in the UK, again, that I just mentioned.
[02:12:51.427 --> 02:12:53.368]  Very, very serious.
[02:12:54.369 --> 02:12:57.571]  We'll be covering more of that on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:12:57.591 --> 02:12:58.512]  Meanwhile, we've got this.
[02:12:59.313 --> 02:13:06.498]  Biden looks senile, lost and out of place as he shuffles through papers at the UN and then calls for help.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:09.861]  And then they run everybody off.
[02:13:09.921 --> 02:13:10.682]  He says, help!
[02:13:10.742 --> 02:13:11.583]  I don't know who I am again.
[02:13:12.203 --> 02:13:13.144]  Just incredible footage.
[02:13:13.224 --> 02:13:14.565]  Joe Biden blames his failures.
[02:13:14.585 --> 02:13:15.286]  There's video of this.
[02:13:15.506 --> 02:13:16.207]  We'll play it tomorrow.
[02:13:16.567 --> 02:13:17.808]  What I inherited from Donald Trump.
[02:13:18.209 --> 02:13:21.372]  Oh, you mean the Keystone Pipeline approval you killed?
[02:13:21.652 --> 02:13:23.694]  Or the border that was totally controlled that you killed?
[02:13:23.714 --> 02:13:24.314]  On and on and on.
[02:13:26.016 --> 02:13:26.917]  That's all pure bull.
[02:13:27.157 --> 02:13:30.260]  He went in and turned off all the things Trump did across the board.
[02:13:32.168 --> 02:13:35.270]  Other than the pullout of Afghanistan, but then they did that to botch the whole thing.
[02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:38.611]  Biden tells Indian Prime Minister not to answer questions from the press.
[02:13:39.392 --> 02:13:40.052]  Asleep at the wheel.
[02:13:40.492 --> 02:13:41.633]  And here's the thing I mentioned in the UK.
[02:13:41.693 --> 02:13:43.034]  Panic, hoarding, gasoline begins.
[02:13:43.374 --> 02:13:45.775]  The UK plunges towards winter of discontent.
[02:13:46.635 --> 02:13:47.256]  As they promised.
[02:13:47.876 --> 02:13:49.577]  New lockdowns because you wouldn't take your shots.
[02:13:49.597 --> 02:13:52.138]  It's called being a prisoner.
[02:13:52.939 --> 02:13:55.800]  It's called living under permanent martial law.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.901]  And then there's these articles.
[02:13:57.021 --> 02:14:00.803]  Look who's calling Xi Jinping the most dangerous enemy of open societies in the world.
[02:14:01.912 --> 02:14:10.578]  Open societies means your five-year-old has, you know, school visits with pedophiles, or like Germany, where they send 30,000 children, take it from their parents to be raped by pedophiles as the new love.
[02:14:10.598 --> 02:14:11.479]  That's what they called it.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.701]  George Soros calls Xi the most dangerous enemy.
[02:14:14.721 --> 02:14:16.363]  It's all right there.
[02:14:16.843 --> 02:14:19.705]  George Soros, Xi Jinping is the most dangerous enemy of the world.
[02:14:23.948 --> 02:14:25.129]  So what's really going on here?
[02:14:25.389 --> 02:14:28.992]  Now the Chinese call him a global economic terrorist, the son of Satan.
[02:14:31.937 --> 02:14:44.387]  Well, it's because China got set up by the globalists, the communists got put in, they got given all our jobs, everything one-sided, they exploited the Chinese people, the Communist Party got, you know, 25%, maybe 30%, the middlemen got 40%, and America got the rest.
[02:14:45.207 --> 02:14:46.068]  That's what Trump discovered.
[02:14:46.088 --> 02:14:48.930]  He goes, my God, it's not the Chinese communists ripping us off, it's the middlemen.
[02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:49.831]  Exactly.
[02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:57.837]  And now he's ending that, and I'm not lionizing him, because he's got all those death camps as a communist, but he saw Trump.
[02:14:57.897 --> 02:14:59.458]  He says it in the big New York Times article.
[02:14:59.478 --> 02:14:59.919]  Let me show you.
[02:15:01.408 --> 02:15:04.247]   And here's a lot of, this is actually the Wall Street Journal.
[02:15:04.247 --> 02:15:09.887]   GG Ping aims to rein in Chinese capitalism, hue to mal-socialist vision.
[02:15:09.887 --> 02:15:11.267]  This is from last weekend.
[02:15:11.267 --> 02:15:13.807]   Everybody should read it September 20th, because I don't need to
[02:15:13.807 --> 02:15:14.908]  read this to know it's accurate.
[02:15:14.908 --> 02:15:15.927]  I know all the facts.
[02:15:15.927 --> 02:15:16.688]  I know it's true.
[02:15:16.688 --> 02:15:19.528]   I've read it in the Chinese news, put out in the official communist, uh,
[02:15:19.528 --> 02:15:26.347]   inner party newspaper in search of truth, what it's called in English translation.
[02:15:26.755 --> 02:15:36.005]  And in here, he says the final straw was when they took Trump's Twitter and when they stole the election from Trump, as much as he didn't like Trump, he respected it and saw that he ran the country.
[02:15:36.225 --> 02:15:37.146]  And he said, that's it.
[02:15:37.207 --> 02:15:38.989]  We're not, I'm not going to be controlled by these people.
[02:15:39.009 --> 02:15:40.230]  So he started arresting them.
[02:15:41.274 --> 02:15:49.538]  So again, they overthrow a government here, and censor senators here, and then even dictators go, whoa, you're not going to do that to me.
[02:15:50.118 --> 02:15:52.419]  See how the globalists don't think multi-phase in?
[02:15:53.279 --> 02:15:55.380]  They just grab power, grab power, grab power, grab power.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:56.901]  Never think about what that'll even do to them.
[02:15:56.921 --> 02:16:01.383]  They want a worldwide police state with no checks and balances, run by AI?
[02:16:01.623 --> 02:16:03.604]  When somebody's just going to take control of that and kill all of them?
[02:16:03.624 --> 02:16:09.386]  That's the spirit advising them is going to take it over itself.
[02:16:09.426 --> 02:16:10.467]  The AI will control.
[02:16:10.487 --> 02:16:11.027]  It'll be in charge.
[02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:13.381]  China's coming at the beast.
[02:16:13.922 --> 02:16:16.203]  The Communist Party goes back to basics.
[02:16:19.284 --> 02:16:20.544]  So it goes on and on from there.
[02:16:20.704 --> 02:16:25.466]  Meanwhile, Biden's National Security Advisor may be guilty of perjury over Clinton campaign Russiagate plot.
[02:16:25.506 --> 02:16:30.188]  Turns out, as you know, in the last few weeks with these indictments that Hillary staged the whole Russiagate thing.
[02:16:30.208 --> 02:16:32.089]  Well, we already knew that five years ago.
[02:16:32.129 --> 02:16:33.729]  I told you on there before Trump even got elected.
[02:16:36.971 --> 02:16:39.872]  And then continuing here, I already mentioned this, but let me hit it again.
[02:16:40.876 --> 02:16:44.138]  Among those who marched into the Capitol, FBI, FBI informant.
[02:16:44.539 --> 02:16:48.642]  Now everything we talked about and Tucker Carlson talked about is being vindicated.
[02:16:49.482 --> 02:16:52.484]  That's all up on GatewayPundit.com and InfoWars.com and everywhere else.
[02:16:53.765 --> 02:16:58.669]  Also, Oklahoma man pleads guilty to misdemeanor for taking Nancy Pelosi's beer on January 6th.
[02:16:58.929 --> 02:17:02.171]  Will serve six months in federal prison on top of the eight months he's already spent in prison.
[02:17:03.973 --> 02:17:09.477]  And some bad news, House passes red flag gun confiscation bill for ex-military members and lots of Republicans voted for it.
[02:17:10.526 --> 02:17:11.026]  There's another one.
[02:17:11.066 --> 02:17:20.970]  Pelosi cheers as Dems pass radical abortion without limits, legalize partial birth abortion, dismembering babies, lifts all restrictions.
[02:17:22.811 --> 02:17:24.631]  And I'm going to play this on my Sunday show.
[02:17:24.971 --> 02:17:26.252]  Oh no, let's just end with this.
[02:17:27.366 --> 02:17:31.109]  You're a criminal, Hillary Clinton, called a war criminal and a criminal by protesters in Ireland.
[02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:33.270]  Look at her in this royal outfit.
[02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:37.233]  Oh, she's the first woman to head the university as the lordship.
[02:17:38.033 --> 02:17:45.478]  Protesters stationed outside Queen's University in Belfast, Ireland jeered and hurled insults at former U.S.
[02:17:45.498 --> 02:17:50.501]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Friday as she attended an induction ceremony.
[02:17:51.082 --> 02:17:56.866]  Footage shows the two-time failed Democrat presidential candidate.
[02:17:57.706 --> 02:18:04.492]  Being escorted to Belfast wearing a large, flowing ceremonial gown of royalty to be made the head of the university.
[02:18:05.212 --> 02:18:05.392]  Oh!
[02:18:06.353 --> 02:18:06.513]  Oh!
[02:18:06.593 --> 02:18:10.416]  She was made the head of it a year ago, but COVID kept her from coming in.
[02:18:10.456 --> 02:18:10.917]  Look at her!
[02:18:11.517 --> 02:18:12.258]  Oh, how cute!
[02:18:12.338 --> 02:18:13.799]  Hope those robes make her happy.
[02:18:14.359 --> 02:18:14.760]  In hell!
[02:18:16.459 --> 02:18:21.183]  But all the festoon jewels, all the festoon gold, all the kingly robes.
[02:18:21.203 --> 02:18:22.163]  You guys have an overhead shot for me?
[02:18:22.203 --> 02:18:22.424]  Thanks.
[02:18:23.104 --> 02:18:26.947]  All of that, ladies and gentlemen, will not ever make her a queen or a good person.
[02:18:26.967 --> 02:18:32.551]  It'll make her a war criminal, globalist scumbag involving child trafficking and every other crime you could ever imagine.
[02:18:32.591 --> 02:18:36.234]  It's been a real pleasure to take her on and make sure she'd win that last election.
[02:18:36.654 --> 02:18:41.398]  That's what they targeted me and I take their targeting and attacks as a badge of honor.
[02:18:42.939 --> 02:18:46.042]  And in closing, I take all of you keeping us on air and this great crew.
[02:18:47.449 --> 02:18:49.370]  As friends forever in eternity.
[02:18:49.410 --> 02:18:50.631]  And I appreciate you all.
[02:18:51.091 --> 02:18:52.152]  I do not take it for granted.
[02:18:52.172 --> 02:18:56.554]  And I ask listeners and viewers again, we pay our crew decent.
[02:18:56.914 --> 02:18:58.075]  The rest of the media is imploded.
[02:18:58.855 --> 02:19:00.316]  We try to have reporters.
[02:19:00.336 --> 02:19:01.557]  We try to go out and cover things.
[02:19:02.037 --> 02:19:03.318]  We've got to have security here.
[02:19:03.338 --> 02:19:04.138]  We got to pay for it.
[02:19:04.178 --> 02:19:06.260]  We got to pay for all our own infrastructure on bandwidth.
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:07.200]  I'm not bitching.
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:08.401]  Just, it's a big nut to crack.
[02:19:09.141 --> 02:19:20.314]   And, um, we've got out of the red last year in the early this year, and now we're back in the, back in the red and out of the black because all the great
[02:19:20.314 --> 02:19:23.803]   supplements and products we've been able to get, you see they're gone for six, seven, eight,
[02:19:23.803 --> 02:19:29.103]   nine, ten months and then we get limited supply because we haven't cut the quality. And I'm not
[02:19:29.103 --> 02:19:32.634]   going to cut the quality of the organic supplements we've got. So I'm just going to have to come up
[02:19:32.634 --> 02:19:36.904]   with some new formulas that have things that are available that are great and good for you that don't,
[02:19:36.904 --> 02:19:38.794]  you know, they're actually in supply.
[02:19:38.794 --> 02:19:42.713]   But again, people thought a few weeks ago I talked about my pool being broken, then I was
[02:19:42.713 --> 02:19:44.713]  I was bitching about my pool being broken.
[02:19:43.912 --> 02:19:50.473]  No, I'm selling my nice house because I bought a nice bigger house because I don't trust banks to have an investment, so I'd have money to fund this place.
[02:19:50.713 --> 02:19:52.054]  And now's the time to cash out of it.
[02:19:52.434 --> 02:19:53.954]  And then the freeze couldn't get help.
[02:19:54.034 --> 02:19:55.674]  Everybody's off from COVID.
[02:19:55.894 --> 02:19:57.115]  Nobody wants to work anymore.
[02:19:57.175 --> 02:19:58.535]  But the building supplies aren't there.
[02:19:59.115 --> 02:20:01.736]  And I have blue tile in my pool.
[02:20:03.305 --> 02:20:10.210]  They don't have blue tile anywhere of any size, basically, for the area I need to do where, you know, pipes broke and it busted out on the side of the pool.
[02:20:11.732 --> 02:20:16.195]  And all over the country, so I got some gray tile finally came in to fix it to sell the house.
[02:20:16.215 --> 02:20:18.857]  It wasn't about bitching about, oh, my pool and my tile.
[02:20:19.138 --> 02:20:21.179]  It's about there's not even tile for pools!
[02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:26.223]  Went to all these places, went online, thought, oh, you got square gray ones like that?
[02:20:26.263 --> 02:20:26.884]  We'll take that!
[02:20:29.315 --> 02:20:31.796]  Because I'm not going to sell the house with a broken pool.
[02:20:32.456 --> 02:20:35.057]  So it's just the medicine's running out.
[02:20:35.117 --> 02:20:36.058]  The food's running out.
[02:20:37.138 --> 02:20:41.340]  When they broke this and told everybody to stay home and locked down the third world, it's starving them to death.
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:44.141]  So they're going to come here and be political minions of the globalists.
[02:20:44.961 --> 02:20:47.322]  So I feel sorry for them, but now they're being used as a weapon.
[02:20:48.993 --> 02:20:51.835]  It's all a giant technocracy and it's so damn dangerous.
[02:20:51.875 --> 02:20:58.899]  So I'm all in in this fight, ladies and gentlemen, and I need your support to stay on air with the work we're doing.
[02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:08.105]  I want to be able to make donations to those, those reporters and help them get a camera crew, uh, and help them have people to go out and shoot for them and edit and send it back to us so we can get it out.
[02:21:08.406 --> 02:21:09.486]  And so we can fund things.
[02:21:10.727 --> 02:21:15.050]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, we can't do that unless you are funding us.
[02:21:15.919 --> 02:21:17.322]  So I want to fight the globalists.
[02:21:17.483 --> 02:21:19.126]  I want to be able to get around the censors.
[02:21:20.329 --> 02:21:21.432]  I've got so much I want to do.
[02:21:22.614 --> 02:21:23.837]  I got products you already need.
[02:21:23.877 --> 02:21:24.338]  We have.
[02:21:26.189 --> 02:21:29.331]  Super high quality vitamin D3 taken under the tongue that everybody needs to be taking.
[02:21:29.651 --> 02:21:31.713]  We've got Ultra 12, the highest quality B12.
[02:21:31.773 --> 02:21:33.054]  Both of them are 50% off.
[02:21:33.394 --> 02:21:38.537]  That sale's going to have to end Monday morning because we have to sell some of it at regular price to get our money back.
[02:21:38.557 --> 02:21:40.419]  But people only buy now when stuff's discounted.
[02:21:40.439 --> 02:21:41.019]  And I get that.
[02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:42.360]  So we're kind of in a cash 22.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.561]  Selling out of it, but still discounted to sell it.
[02:21:44.982 --> 02:21:46.743]  And then they don't have it for six months.
[02:21:47.343 --> 02:21:48.824]  Get yours at infowarestore.com.
[02:21:48.844 --> 02:21:49.945]  Get your knockout sleep aid.
[02:21:49.965 --> 02:21:51.446]  It's back in 50% off.
[02:21:51.726 --> 02:21:54.648]  T-shirts, that ends Monday at cost as low as $9.95.
[02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:59.530]  Some of the designer shirts cost us $18, so we're selling those for $14.95.
[02:21:59.830 --> 02:22:00.970]  Some of the shirts cost us $5.
[02:22:01.350 --> 02:22:10.092]  We average it together where the low-end shirts are still great, $9.95, and then the designer stuff, $14.95, costs us more to make stuff in America.
[02:22:10.252 --> 02:22:11.932]  More than half our clothing line is made in America.
[02:22:11.972 --> 02:22:14.933]  Almost all of it's printed here in America, but some of it is made elsewhere.
[02:22:14.953 --> 02:22:19.854]  If you really want a t-shirt I'd sell for $10, we've got to do that because it costs us $5 to make it in Mexico.
[02:22:21.305 --> 02:22:24.128]  So it's infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:22:24.348 --> 02:22:30.635]  A lot of shirts to trigger leftists, you name it.
[02:22:31.055 --> 02:22:32.497]  Ball caps, you name it.
[02:22:32.537 --> 02:22:33.958]  Books, films, the great film.
[02:22:34.499 --> 02:22:37.863]  Start shipping on October 6th is The Lockdown.
[02:22:39.884 --> 02:22:44.986]  It is Cub and Land the Lockdown Part One, and you get a free copy of Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:22:45.246 --> 02:22:47.808]  And that way you have an archive that you can copy, you can share.
[02:22:48.188 --> 02:22:48.468]  All right.
[02:22:48.488 --> 02:22:50.569]  I want to thank the crew for another amazing job.
[02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:53.450]  And Lord willing, as I said, I'll be back tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:22:53.470 --> 02:22:55.171]  Central, Owen at 6 p.m.
[02:22:55.191 --> 02:22:56.892]  Central with Sunday Live.
[02:22:57.332 --> 02:23:04.695]  And even if you already know all this and are sick of the show, like I am sometimes, tell people about it because this is new to them and the minds are open right now to hear the truth.
[02:23:04.975 --> 02:23:10.098]  But those Aussies I had on were amazing, and I hope you'll take clips out and share it and do whatever.
[02:23:10.118 --> 02:23:10.979]  This is all free to air.
[02:23:11.399 --> 02:23:12.960]  Don't send us emails every day by the hundreds.
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:13.740]  Can we take clips?
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:14.981]  Can we re-upload you?
[02:23:15.261 --> 02:23:15.941]  Can we edit you?
[02:23:15.981 --> 02:23:16.642]  Can we share you?
[02:23:16.662 --> 02:23:17.823]  Can I have a clip of this in my film?
[02:23:18.103 --> 02:23:18.423]  Yes!
[02:23:19.804 --> 02:23:20.084]  Yes!
[02:23:20.364 --> 02:23:20.644]  Yes!
[02:23:20.724 --> 02:23:21.725]  It's all free to air!
[02:23:21.965 --> 02:23:23.226]  It's all copyright free!
[02:23:23.426 --> 02:23:24.486]  It's all open commons!
[02:23:24.506 --> 02:23:25.487]  We're in a war!
[02:23:26.027 --> 02:23:27.148]  We need to take action!
[02:23:27.288 --> 02:23:27.868]  Get it out!
[02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:30.310]  Alright, that's it for this transmission.
[02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:32.291]  God bless, and good luck.
[02:23:35.856 --> 02:23:40.560]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:42.481]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:23:42.781 --> 02:23:47.745]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:23:48.266 --> 02:23:48.906]  But we failed.
[02:23:49.347 --> 02:23:50.588]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:23:51.008 --> 02:23:52.549]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:23:52.869 --> 02:23:58.093]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[02:23:58.874 --> 02:24:07.279]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:24:07.799 --> 02:24:13.002]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:24:13.242 --> 02:24:15.663]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[02:24:15.903 --> 02:24:20.406]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarrestore.com.
[02:24:20.666 --> 02:24:25.829]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[02:24:26.209 --> 02:24:30.891]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[02:24:31.131 --> 02:24:33.232]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[02:24:33.472 --> 02:24:35.453]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[02:24:35.793 --> 02:24:38.255]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[02:24:38.595 --> 02:24:41.056]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[02:24:41.636 --> 02:24:44.538]  Monday at midnight we've got to end this sale.
[02:24:44.618 --> 02:24:48.561]  We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[02:24:48.981 --> 02:24:50.583]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is super popular.
[02:24:50.903 --> 02:24:53.485]  It's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[02:24:53.805 --> 02:24:55.346]  Great amino acids and it tastes great.
[02:24:55.526 --> 02:24:59.889]  It's powder form so in the water you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:02.311]  Then we also have Back in Stock.
[02:25:02.351 --> 02:25:03.612]  This sale will continue through next week.
