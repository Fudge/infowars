[00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:25.044]   Simultaneously in South Korea, Singapore, the UK and globalist controlled areas like New York City and New York State, they are announcing that you must have vaccine passports to be able to go see a basketball game or football game or rent a car, get in a hotel and then it will expand to everybody and then a PCR test We'll be fraudulently connected to that so they can track and control everything you do.
[00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.247]  This is the domestic internal passport.
[00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:29.868]  This is the global government.
[00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:44.380]  Oh, but you don't need any ID to vote, but you've got to every day, everywhere you go, pay huge amounts of money to be tested that you don't have COVID-19 with their fraudulent PCR and that you've had all these deadly vaccines and there's always a new mutation.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.923]  So now they're saying 10 vaccines a year and they're in RNA.
[00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:49.504]  This is the global government.
[00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:51.264]  This is the post-human takeover.
[00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:53.785]  This is teaching you that humans are unnatural and bad.
[00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:55.565]  This is teaching us we have to live in bubbles.
[00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:01.627]  This is the post-human New World Order takeover and everyone must resist and say no.
[00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:04.487]  It's only going to get worse from here the more you submit.
[00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:08.068]  And I wish Trump would have woken up and stood against this, but that's too late.
[00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.908]  Now we've got Biden and the Globals to face head on.
[00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:30.908]  [MUSIC]
[00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:52.257]  As you know, I have been extremely critical of President Trump when it comes to the fact that he pushed Operation Warp Speed and basically waived all the regulations and laws allowing the deployment of this untested system, which for decades they couldn't get approved because mRNA gene therapies were causing so many cancers and deaths.
[00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:53.158]  That's a fact.
[00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:57.315]  And so I speculated on why did President Trump do this?
[00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:02.758]  And I said, well, devil's advocate, and again I'm not supporting what he did, but I think he's a good person.
[00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:05.819]  I believe he knows they were going to keep the economy locked down.
[00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.501]  They were saying two years, four years, six years, ten years.
[00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:17.351]  Until we got this magic vaccine and their goal was to keep the economy shut down, to bankrupt the nation, to bankrupt small businesses.
[00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:26.155]  Now Trump should have attacked the fraudulent premise that this was even a deadly virus or that we needed to stay locked down or that social distancing worked or the mask.
[00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:28.936]  He should have gone after all of that and he did at his rallies.
[00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:34.030]   Those were places where people didn't wear masks and Trump spoke out against it but it It wasn't enough.
[00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.136]  He kind of had a foot in both worlds.
[00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:41.229]  He was standing one foot here, in reality the other foot with the establishment.
[00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:51.423]  Clearly, I got the fact that he thought if he accelerated the vaccine, that would put them in checkmate and say, okay, now you've got to reopen instead of him just being the president and calling the fraud out.
[00:02:51.823 --> 00:03:06.606]  Well, now he went on Laura Ingraham's show Friday night and basically said exactly what I was predicting he had done and said he's very proud of this and he got it done in nine months when they were going to take up to a decade to do it.
[00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:10.967]  And it's just like, you know, I built this building in record speed and I built this wall in record speed.
[00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:15.670]  And really, that's why people get mad at Trump because he's making it about him and what he's building.
[00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.132]  Hey, maybe he built the Death Star in record speed and blows up America.
[00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:21.153]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:23.355]  So, a lot of folks are mad at Trump.
[00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:28.538]  I've been critical as well, but now we know that indeed that's why he did it, so they would end the lockdown.
[00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:31.220]  But now they're saying, does it matter if you have the vaccines?
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.182]  We're not going to end the lockdown because that was always their goal.
[00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:46.271]   And to also put out poison vaccines that cause so many illnesses and death, 4,000 deaths in Europe now, the EU's own reporting system says, And they're just conditioning us to have this testing done and to have liability protection.
[00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.032]  It's insane and it's wrong.
[00:03:48.092 --> 00:04:00.358]  And I think Trump's been set up because as the deaths from the vaccines come out and as the illnesses come out down the road, because all the experts say the real problems are going to be down the road, not just the initial deaths and bad reactions, they're going to blame Trump.
[00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:06.601]  That's why early on when he said, take the vaccine, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden said, oh, don't take anything he recommends.
[00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:07.382]  It might kill you.
[00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:13.058]  So that, again, when it starts killing people, which it is, they blame him.
[00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:14.759]  So Trump stepped in it here.
[00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.880]  But again, I don't think he did it to be evil.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.061]  I know his son, Barron, got damaged by vaccines.
[00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:22.082]  And we've just got to get Trump to turn around on this.
[00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:24.864]  But he's so proud of it, he may never do it.
[00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:27.245]  But now we know why he did it.
[00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.287]  Not from a point of evil, but from a point of trying to unlock the country.
[00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:32.588]  So here's what he had to say on Laura Ingraham.
[00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:35.911]  You know, they used to say Germany and all these other countries in Europe.
[00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:43.639]  Well, you look at them, they're all locked down, they're shut down, and the virus is hitting them hard, and the vaccine isn't doing well.
[00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.303]  They're not getting... Now, you know, we came up with the vaccine.
[00:04:47.343 --> 00:04:50.687]  That was done with my administration and, frankly, me.
[00:04:50.747 --> 00:04:54.831]  The FDA is not in love with me because I pushed them at a level that they've never been pushed.
[00:04:54.971 --> 00:05:00.649]   but we got a vaccine in nine months, Laura, and it was supposed to take five years. Fauci said
[00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.971]   it's probably never going to happen. I mean, Fauci was saying three years, four years,
[00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:10.410]   five years. A lot of people said 12 years. And I got it done in nine months. And it's,
[00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.131]  you know, it's really a great accomplishment.
[00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:17.930]   Speaking of Fauci, do you regret giving him so much power early on?
[00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.850]   No, look, I got along with him fine, but I didn't listen to him too much because he said,
[00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.329]  don't close it up to China and I did very early.
[00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.761]  Don't close it up to Europe.
[00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:31.222]  You know, we had the problem with Italy and France.
[00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:32.122]  I did.
[00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:34.802]  I closed it up to Europe very, very early.
[00:05:35.663 --> 00:05:37.383]  He said don't wear masks.
[00:05:37.443 --> 00:05:38.323]  Masks don't work.
[00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:39.023]  They're no good.
[00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:39.504]  No good.
[00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:45.245]  I mean, you know, think of what... You look at his... The way I look at it, you saw him throw out the first pitch.
[00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:46.986]  In Washington, right?
[00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:51.450]  He is a better pitcher than he is at what he does, but he's a great promoter.
[00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.131]  But I got along with him.
[00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:53.652]  It was right.
[00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:59.316]  But if you really look, I didn't really listen to him too much because I was doing the opposite of what he was saying.
[00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:06.743]  But, I mean, frankly, if he were known as somebody that was with me all the way, he wouldn't be popular with the media.
[00:06:07.003 --> 00:06:08.464]  He's just a media creation.
[00:06:08.644 --> 00:06:11.887]  And as usual, Trump does some bad things in the interview, but also some good things.
[00:06:11.927 --> 00:06:13.028]  He says Fauci's a fraud.
[00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:14.970]  Fauci was a self-promoter.
[00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:19.915]  Fauci would say one thing and do another, like not wearing a mask in public, just like John Kerry.
[00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:21.897]  So again, that's the answer.
[00:06:21.957 --> 00:06:22.978]  Go after the frauds.
[00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.260]  Go after Bill Gates.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.802]  Go after Bloomberg that was involved.
[00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:29.245]  Go after Fauci and the Wuhan lab.
[00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:36.771]   Don't let them that set this whole thing up Even while the former head of the CDC has come out and said, you were right, it came out of Wuhan.
[00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.033]  Do the victory lap and expose them.
[00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.436]  Don't let them set you up for what they carried out.
[00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:49.200]  Just like they recommended to all these governors, put sick people in nursing homes to get death numbers up.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.581]  Well, that wasn't you.
[00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:51.761]  That was them giving those orders.
[00:06:52.142 --> 00:06:54.783]  As long as you come out against them, you won't get the blame for it.
[00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:57.766]  And those that are behind it are the ones that end up going to jail.
[00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:01.088]  But separately, President Trump, I want to play one more clip for you.
[00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:09.388]  Listen to your constituents in Ohio and New York and Michigan and just everywhere in South Dakota and Texas and Florida.
[00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:10.189]  It's everywhere.
[00:07:10.549 --> 00:07:17.254]  CNN has done dozens of these interviews where they go into these towns and they say, hey, why aren't you taking your vaccines?
[00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:20.516]  The people say, we don't trust the government because of the past history.
[00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:21.557]  And why would they trust them?
[00:07:21.997 --> 00:07:23.138]  They lied about the number of deaths.
[00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:24.479]  They lied about why people died.
[00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:27.901]  They've lied the entire time, the whole history.
[00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:32.326]  Does anybody in this restaurant think it's a good idea to take the vaccine?
[00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:34.868]  Raise your hand if you think it's a good idea.
[00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.850]  Anyone here has a good idea to take the vaccine?
[00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.932]  Raise your hand if you think it's a good idea.
[00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:42.752]   in this restaurant think it's a good idea to take the vaccine?
[00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:45.271]  Raise your hand if you think it's a good idea.
[00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:49.132]  Anyone here is a good idea to take the vaccine.
[00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:50.511]  Raise your hand if you think it's a good idea.
[00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.232]  Not one person here thinks it's a good idea.
[00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:56.912]  Complete quiet.
[00:07:57.008 --> 00:07:58.689]  Ladies and gentlemen, these polls are all fake.
[00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:02.031]  When you see poll numbers of half the public planning to take the vaccine, that's a lie.
[00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:05.713]  I have talked to people, black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:08.515]  Almost all of them don't trust it or are planning to not take it.
[00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:10.837]  In fact, they hope that no one's going to try to force them to do it.
[00:08:11.397 --> 00:08:16.981]  So when you see these announcements that you've got to accept it, that is to bully you into submission.
[00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:18.422]  Just read the facts.
[00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:20.483]  They now say, oh, there'll be new mutations.
[00:08:20.844 --> 00:08:21.744]  This won't protect you.
[00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:23.185]  Just like a flu vaccine.
[00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:24.526]  Just like a cold vaccine.
[00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.567]  They've never worked.
[00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:31.971]  And so they're just expanding this fraud now, but saying you've got to have this for a right to have a job or to travel.
[00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:37.815]  This is incredibly dangerous, but it's part of the medicalization or the medical tyranny that's taking over.
[00:08:38.156 --> 00:08:54.492]   Now, if you're watching here on the Live Sunday Show, And not just at Bandot Video, we're about to hand the baton to Jason Jones, formerly of Hawaii, major filmmaker, best-selling author, who is really exposing the tyranny of the ongoing lockdowns, not just in Europe, but here as well.
[00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:57.715]  So I hand the baton now to Jason Jones.
[00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:00.037]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[00:09:00.237 --> 00:09:02.700]  And if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:07.603 --> 00:09:13.628]  I have committed to you to not back down in the face of not just America, but the world's ruling class.
[00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:20.092]  And InfoWars has been instrumental, thanks to your support and your prayers, in game-changing everything.
[00:09:20.673 --> 00:09:24.716]  But we're under attack at so many levels, and I'm not going to spend time getting into that.
[00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:25.677]  You know what's going on.
[00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:33.570]  Please spread the word about our broadcasts and our articles and our videos, because people are so ready to hear the truth right now, the ground is so fertile.

[00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:40.577]  Again, I thank you for all you've done so far.

[00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:56.785]  Just find that in the support link and then footworkstore.com.
[00:09:57.185 --> 00:10:01.067]  But get the products that help you and help your family that you're going to need over and over again.
[00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:04.889]  And stuff that also just makes your life more fun and more enjoyable, like our Waking America coffee.
[00:10:05.802 --> 00:10:06.342]  It's excellent.
[00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:07.662]  It's very, very low priced.
[00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:08.903]  The quality you're getting.
[00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:10.723]  Very same stuff as Sol de Gourmet.
[00:10:10.963 --> 00:10:13.284]  Bobby shops for 50% more on average.
[00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:14.504]  We're probably about to go up in price.
[00:10:14.524 --> 00:10:17.385]  This has gone up for our pricing as well.
[00:10:18.025 --> 00:10:24.126]  So whether it's our iodine products, or whether it's Emirates Essentials products, all the great organic essential oils, shampoo, you name it.
[00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:27.967]  Whether it is our great nootropic, Brain Force Plus, it's back in stock.
[00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:29.628]  It funds the info war.
[00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:33.472]   But when we sell it, 50% off with free shipping.
[00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:34.694]  We have to sell a lot of products.
[00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:39.860]  So yes, we bring in a ton of money, but the profit is small and we need that to fund the operation.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.823]  So, the world's ready to awaken.
[00:10:42.444 --> 00:10:45.107]  You've got a team willing to fight to the end, but we need the support.
[00:10:45.407 --> 00:10:46.849]  So you've kept us in the game this long.
[00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.991]  You've seen the great results.
[00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:51.474]  Keep us in the game now because we're down to the final few minutes.
[00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:52.695]  Again, thank you for your support.
[00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:53.855]  Thanks for your prayers.
[00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:54.896]  Thanks for your word of mouth.
