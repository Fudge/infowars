[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.832]  If the unvaccinated get vaccinated, they will protect themselves and other unvaccinated people around them.
[00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:15.055]  If they do not, states with low vaccination rates may see those rates go up, may see this progress reversed.
[00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:20.598]  Ultimately, those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price.
[00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.991]  I've not taken a vacation in 20 plus years where I actually ever take off.
[00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:29.575]  And I promised my wife and children that I was going to do it.
[00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:38.923]  But the news breaking today is so incredibly important that I'm here at the beach in what's left of America and I've got to go on air and lay out and break down what's unfolding.
[00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:46.830]  You see, the IMF and the World Bank and the private central banks that basically own and control the planet want a world ID system.
[00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.390]  And the man they hired to basically set it up is named Klaus Schwab.
[00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.952]  He ran the whole UN Sustainability Program.
[00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.414]  Now he heads up the Davos Group.
[00:00:55.215 --> 00:01:03.166]   They came out five years ago and called for a great reset to cut global carbon, but also to create a world ID For every citizen.
[00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:11.648]  And Klaus Schwab said they would use the fear of a virus to bring in this world ID, this world medical system, which will form the basis again of the world ID.
[00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:20.569]  He even told French television five years ago that once they put this in place, they're going to start implanting microchips under everyone's skin to track and trace and control us.
[00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:30.240]   Well, Biden came out a few days ago and said, okay, you don't have to wear the mask anymore if you're vaccinated, but We knew it was coming next.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.942]  Cuomo, Governor of New York, came out and said, you need to be vaccinated, you need to show proof to get on trains, to get on buses, and of course later to get on airplanes as they're planned.
[00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.923]  So first you've got to wear the mask because you're dirty and you're bad.
[00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:49.183]  Now the mask can go away, we predicted this a year ago, but you have to have the vaccine.
[00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:52.904]  And we're going to play a clip of Cuomo here in a moment, but notice he's very slick about this.
[00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:57.185]  He explains, oh, if the business would like to, they should ask you to do this.
[00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:12.881]  So they want to get the program going in these blue cities, in these authoritarian regions, and see if people will willingly waive their rights to be the starter group to get all the corporate minions and enforcers at the sports stadiums, at the malls, at the grocery stores.
[00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:16.804]  Accustomed to demanding these QR codes that G.G.
[00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:19.146]  Pink's called for that are tied to your medical records.
[00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.586]  This violates your HIPAA rights.
[00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:21.667]  It's so incredibly dangerous.
[00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:24.309]  And it's not like it's speculation that this is going to be abused.
[00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.690]  It's not like I'm just saying that that's the case.
[00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.172]  Out of the gates, they're saying this is a World ID.
[00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:30.393]  So the UK is calling for it.
[00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:33.294]  Other authoritarians like Cuomo are calling for it.
[00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:35.456]  And in fact, they're actually implementing it now.
[00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:37.457]  And it's all being done color of law.
[00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:43.777]   It's all extremely, extremely on a scale of 1 to 10, a 10 and a half, or in spinal tap
[00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:47.056]  lingo, an 11 on the tyranny Richter scale.
[00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:48.736]  When you got vaccinated, you got a card.
[00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.736]  Uh...
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.621]  You could also have the Empire Pass, which is on your smartphone.
[00:02:55.481 --> 00:03:03.103]  But on a vaccinated venue, you will be asked, or can be asked, to produce that card and proof of vaccination.
[00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:13.770]   So it can be the Excelsior Pass or the card, But you have to show that when you enter the venue.
[00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.912]  Or if you're asked, you have to present that.
[00:03:17.052 --> 00:03:21.652]   there's a QR code on it that you'll be able to use to present as proof of your vaccination
[00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:24.452]   thousands and thousands of people have used the Excelsior Pass
[00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:28.552]   and/or shown proof of vaccination so far so this is not something that's new
[00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:32.752]   what's new would be that it's 100% of all people in those places
[00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:36.552]   so you have to 100% vaccinate it you guys aren't waiting for us, are ya?
[00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:38.352]  dude, I ain't waiting for you!
[00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:39.852]  oh my god!
[00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:41.268]  Your shirt is red.
[00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.788]  That was amazing!
[00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.289]  Johnny Cash.
[00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.310]  Yeah, it just ripped earlier, so I ripped this off.
[00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.350]  Good to see you.
[00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.751]  How you doing, man?
[00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:49.531]  Hell yeah.
[00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:50.892]  I heard that voice.
[00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:52.072]  I was like, I know that voice.
[00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:59.779]  What do you guys think of Fauci and all the trouble he's getting in getting caught running the Wuhan lab?
[00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.301]  They talk about it at work every day.
[00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.043]  It's something that we go over.
[00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:06.946]  That's like our morning meeting is talking about all the crap that's... Exactly.
[00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:11.931]  Well, now they're going to try to make you have a medical ID to prove you have one of these vaccines.
[00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:15.135]  But half of the CDC and NIH won't even take the vaccine.
[00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:22.084]  I know a lot of medical professionals that won't take it, but it's optional for them right now.
[00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:23.606]  That's why we've got to say we're not doing it.
[00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:24.527]  We've got to say optional, man.
[00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:25.629]  Hey, check this out.
[00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:35.032]   I work on a military base, and I got an email today that says, if you're vaccinated, You don't have to wear a mask.
[00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.574]  If you're not vaccinated, you still gotta wear a mask.
[00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:39.974]  Well, that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:42.693]   They were always planning to say wear the mask like you're bad.
[00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:46.534]   Then they want to then use that as a way to identify who's vaccinated and not and try
[00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:48.333]  to create a world ID.
[00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:52.974]   So bigger than the vaccine, the mask leads to the vaccine, leads to the world ID.
[00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:54.173]  And so that's the big thing they're pushing for.
[00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:56.373]   And then once the big corporations have that, it's total control.
[00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.366]  What do you do after that, man?
[00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:58.247]  Alex Jones, baby.
[00:04:58.307 --> 00:04:59.568]  That's my brother.
[00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.151]  Say no to the mask, man, and say no to the medical ID.
[00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.852]  But they even did that.
[00:05:04.912 --> 00:05:13.799]  I got a school email about him saying, as parents, if we're vaccinated, then we don't have to wear masks and everything.
[00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:14.780]  It's all intimidation.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.701]  Like, you're dirty, you're bad.
[00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:17.822]  If you don't have the vaccine, you better still wear your mask.
[00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:18.343]  It's all a lie.
[00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:19.824]  The mask gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[00:05:19.864 --> 00:05:20.685]  They'd never predict it on anybody.
[00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:21.085]  Yeah.
[00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.112]  We'll stand up and speak out about it because the plan is to incrementally force us to take vaccines which are experimental.
[00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:29.832]  They're all experimental.
[00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:30.613]  That's the thing.
[00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:36.134]  You can look it up and it's a experimental medicine is all it is.
[00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:41.176]  I was watching that deal the other day where I think it was you that was showing that there's nothing on the information sheet.
[00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:41.796]  Absolutely.
[00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.557]  It's like they're using us as lab rats.
[00:05:44.837 --> 00:05:45.377]  Absolutely.
[00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:46.478]  That's all you are is a lab rat.
[00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:47.018]  Absolutely.
[00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:56.161]  And they said they didn't study this on lab rats, but they did under other vaccine names in 2012 at UT, and it caused blood clots and heart attacks in most of the rats.
[00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:57.722]  So they said never make a vaccine.
[00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:03.964]  So that's why this time they skipped animal trials with a new vaccine, but it's still basically the same vaccine that makes your body attack its own proteins.
[00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:06.104]  That's why women are having all these problems, men are having problems.
[00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:06.925]  I didn't hear about that.
[00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:08.405]  Well, God bless you guys.
[00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:09.406]  Have a great evening.
[00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:10.046]  Bye-bye, buddy.
[00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.607]  Can I please get a picture with you?
[00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:12.708]  Let's do it, brother.
[00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:14.589]  Thank you so much.
[00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.750]  So this is a premeditated formulae.
[00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.271]  First, you've got to wear the mask.
[00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:20.552]  You've got to stay in your house.
[00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:21.012]  You're bad.
[00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:22.072]  Martial law is okay.
[00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:23.113]  You're not essential.
[00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:24.293]  Small businesses are shut down.
[00:06:24.674 --> 00:06:26.795]  Churches are shut down, but Walmart and Target are open.
[00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:34.790]  And then it's, oh, you can take the mask off, but now we need everybody to find out if you've been vaccinated and intimidate you and bully you into having the vaccine.
[00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.330]  Oh, but then that vaccine's not going to be enough.
[00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.851]  They're going to want more and more and more.
[00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.831]  And again, they're not even vaccines.
[00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:41.151]  They're totally experimental.
[00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:43.372]  And all you needed was vitamins and minerals and sunshine.
[00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:51.073]  And so the good news is while we're out here shooting this in Florida, this last five minutes, we had group after group, after group come by.
[00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:53.714]  Everybody was a listener and understood what was going on.
[00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.042]  And so, again, that shows the mass awakening's happening, except they were all saying, Alex, we need you, keep it up.
[00:06:59.422 --> 00:07:04.266]  No, I need all of you watching and listening to take this video and share it on your email, share it on your text message.
[00:07:04.286 --> 00:07:12.872]  It's harder for them to censor there, then on Facebook, then on Twitter, then on YouTube, and realize this is a diabolical plan to bring in a world government under the UN, under the WHO.
[00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.415]  So, listen again to the words, very carefully, of the governor.
[00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:20.903]   More than half the deaths in the state were sending sick people with flu, pneumonia, and
[00:07:20.903 --> 00:07:25.543]   COVID into nursing homes, knowing it would kill them. And then $53,000 per person,
[00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:30.584]   if they intubated them, even though scientists up front said that will kill people when they
[00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:34.663]   have this COVID to put them on a ventilator. When you got vaccinated, you got a card.
[00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:43.944]   You could also have the Empire Pass, which is on your smartphone. But on a vaccinated venue,
[00:07:44.584 --> 00:07:49.064]   you will be asked or can be asked to produce that card and proof of vaccination.
[00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:59.063]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:59.796]  So it can be the Excelsior Pass or the card, but you have to show that when you enter the venue.
[00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:02.992]  Or if you're asked, you have to present that.
[00:08:03.812 --> 00:08:07.714]  There's a QR code on it that you'll be able to use to present this proof of your vaccination.
[00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:10.155]  So this has been a very systematic, diabolical plan.
[00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.016]  Remember, the third world's still locked down and starving to death.
[00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.197]  And the UN's going to use that collapse to ship them all here.
[00:08:15.997 --> 00:08:17.618]  So that's part of that replacement migration.
[00:08:18.338 --> 00:08:21.980]  But we're being taught in the West that we're not essential as well in being collapsed in the third world status.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.660]  This is all a systematic plan.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:32.569]   So Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, all of them need to be criminally investigated, as Senator Rand Paul has said, and need to be tried and then sent to prison.
[00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:41.618]  Because they cooked this thing up, they created the gain of function, they did it all at the Wuhan lab, as scientists that we had on 16 months ago on air told you.
[00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:51.903]  Because this was all a major controversy in 2015 at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when they did 11 total programs and moved them to Wohan, all run by Bill Gates and Fauci.
[00:08:52.443 --> 00:09:01.328]  So Fauci had to be the controller of this so he could get away with it when they released it to cause a collapse, a shutdown in the economy, and to remove President Trump from office.
[00:09:01.968 --> 00:09:05.270]  The only problem is President Trump believed it was a regular vaccine, wanted to get the economy going.
[00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:07.206]  He didn't want them holding the economy hostage.
[00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:10.267]  So he said, accelerate the vaccine and that gave them liability protection.
[00:09:10.287 --> 00:09:11.088]  Now they can get away with it.
[00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:14.389]  So Trump needs to really understand that the public is turning against this.
[00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.292]  Most people are refusing to take it and that half the doctors at the NIH and CDC have refused as well.
[00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.831]  And that's really the big news everybody needs to know.
[00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:24.792]   And while I've been here in Florida just a few days, I have run into dozens of people
[00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:27.270]  that have said, "My mom, my dad died of it.
[00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.270]  My brother's dying.
[00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.591]  The lady at my church is dying.
[00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:31.751]  Totally healthy, she took the vaccine.
[00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.431]  My son had convulsions.
[00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:36.471]  My doctor got paralyzed."
[00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:39.991]   I mean, this is really going on, and big tech's trying to censor and control that.
[00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:44.290]   But what we do know is they want a world ID based on a medical system for a global social
[00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.871]  credit score to track and trace every facet of your life.
[00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:48.142]  They're now doing it.
[00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:49.882]  It's antithetical to a free society.
[00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.423]  So everybody has to say no.
[00:09:51.483 --> 00:09:52.123]  It has to resist.
[00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:58.765]  It has to call again for the indictment, which is being sought after right now, of tyrants like Governor Cuomo.
[00:09:59.105 --> 00:10:02.165]  Again, we'll be covering all this at Band.Video, NymphoWars.com.
[00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:18.104]   If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:21.744]   One of the best selling supplements in the United States and across the world in the
[00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:26.984]  last decade is magnesium powders because they work so good.
[00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:34.968]  Because they're critical to all your cells to operating smoothly to your heart, to your brain, to your liver, to everything.

[00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:49.433]  I'm going to go over some of the facts from the fact sheet that scientists have put together here in a moment.
[00:10:49.493 --> 00:10:51.074]  But first I want to just explain something.
[00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:53.974]  It took us several years to get this developed.
[00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:57.675]  Because I fund my operations selling products that work and that people want.
[00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:05.937]  And clearly you go to the grocery store, you go anywhere, you see them selling different brands and different forms of magnesium fizzy drinks.
[00:11:06.737 --> 00:11:10.529]   And it's something that when I forget to do it, My day isn't as good.
[00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:19.136]  I've been religiously, since this came in a few weeks ago, and now we've got the full shipment as we can sell it, taking it, and it's just made my life so much better.
[00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:22.859]  And it goes great with the X2, it goes great with the BrainForce+.
[00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:24.200]  It really is amazing.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.025]  It's our new Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Orange Flavored Drink Mix from m4slife.com.
[00:11:31.405 --> 00:11:32.927]  Here's the scientific fact sheet.
[00:11:33.487 --> 00:11:37.091]  True Ionic Magnesium for Optimal Absorption.
[00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:38.412]  That is so important.
[00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:40.234]  The other brands work great.
[00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:44.638]  Magnesium is amazing, but they have one type of magnesium.
[00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:56.410]  This has two types of magnesium, and then when you add the other things that are in the formula, the scientist explained to us that it creates the very best form of ionized magnesium.
[00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.112]  that is absorbed directly into your individual cells.
[00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.452]  Here's another important fact.
[00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:06.917]  An estimated 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended amount of magnesium intake every single day.
[00:12:07.197 --> 00:12:13.100]  Magnesium helps regulate the sodium-potassium pumps that create the signals in the nerve cells.
[00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:21.646]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[00:12:21.765 --> 00:12:43.365]   is It tastes great.
[00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:44.765]  I take it in the morning.
