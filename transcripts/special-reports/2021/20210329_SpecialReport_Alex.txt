[00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:17.449]  You're about to see powerful footage at an anti-lockdown rally over the weekend in the United Kingdom, where a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor describes the parallels to what she saw back in Nazi Germany during the early 1940s with what's happening today.
[00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.791]  And she said rightly, this is worse because they knew the Nazis were oppressing them.
[00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.031]  This system of total control claims that it's protecting us, but it's not.
[00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:39.456]  In Klaus Schwab's own words, in Bill Gates' own words, it's about teaching humans that we're bad, that we're dirty, and preparing us for forced depopulation through carbon cuts.
[00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:52.101]  They're even now admitting, hey, the lockdowns were great, they're going to depopulate the third world, make the animals so happy, and in the Western world, you don't need to be wealthy or successful anymore.
[00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:58.642]  They're calling for yearly and bi-yearly carbon shutdowns to, quote, save the earth.
[00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.443]  And AOC says the world's going to end in 12 years.
[00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:13.745]  Now, she said that a year and a half ago because by the year 2030, under agenda 2030 of the UN, they openly plan to have their world government in place and official depopulation rolling forward.
[00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:16.886]  They want to lower the world population to 500 million.
[00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is worse than Nazi Germany.
[00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:32.366]  Because the robber barons and the Cold Springs Harbor laboratories that funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute that created Hitler are still in control today.
[00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:36.028]  So this is bigger and older than the Nazis.
[00:01:36.488 --> 00:01:37.728]  Here's what she had to say.
[00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.871]  I am in fact a survivor of the Holocaust.
[00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:48.574]  And the first thing I have to tell you that even then nobody told us it was done for our own good.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.181]  We all knew what was happening.
[00:01:54.064 --> 00:02:11.598]  And when I think today, when I see people mad, I think of the Yellow Star, which gave everybody liberty to aggress me, to insult me, to call me a carrier of disease, to spit on me even.
[00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.219]  I love you!
[00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:18.563]  I would like to tell you that this is worse.
[00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.313]  It is more insidious.
[00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:24.916]  It concerns more people.
[00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:40.308]  It is... It is... There is a hypocrisy in the public narrative that is absolutely unbearable to say that we're doing this to protect the old.
[00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.489]   I would love to die in a state that gives me freedom, and live in here.
[00:02:48.489 --> 00:03:06.688]   I have already outstayed my welcome by many years, and my life expectancy is probably
[00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.068]   not great, but I would gladly exchange this for a little bit of freedom.
[00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:23.011]  For the lives and livelihoods and happiness of generations that come after me to live their lives as I have been.
[00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:36.181]  To have masks, to see people defile their children with masks is something totally unbearable to me.
[00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:39.463]  History is repeating itself again.
[00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:44.584]  A member of the British Supreme Court just came out and said the lockdown should last at least 10 years.
[00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:48.985]  Bloomberg and others admit that this is going to be a permanent pandemic.
[00:03:49.785 --> 00:04:05.950]  Next, they're going to start telling us that it's the people that haven't been vaccinated is the reason there's still COVID-19, even though the WHO and Fauci and others admit in the fine print that you can never have a vaccine to cover COVID-19 because it's the common cold and there's too many mutations.
[00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:15.599]  This is an engineered problem to which there is no solution except ever expanding control by our tyrannical world government.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:29.011]   We must form a coalition at the state and local level and also work with other leaders around the planet like President Bolsonaro of Brazil And form a united front saying, no, we do not accept this tyranny.
[00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:32.294]  Governor DeSantis of Florida is a great patriot and he's almost there.
[00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:35.957]  He says that people want the vaccines, which are experimental and very dangerous.
[00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:36.517]  Fine.
[00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:37.658]  That's your right.
[00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:42.722]  And the government will help provide them to you, but there will be no vaccine passports.
[00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:44.683]  It's authoritarian and it's dangerous.
[00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:49.727]  We need to see more leaders stand up like DeSantis and more people need to support DeSantis.
[00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:52.168]  You want the fox to guard the hen house?
[00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:53.589]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.112]  I think this is something that has huge privacy implications.
[00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:59.234]  It is not necessary to do.
[00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:05.078]  We are not going to have you provide proof of this just to be able to live your life normally.
[00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:07.279]  And I'm going to be taking some action.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.964]  In an executive function, emergency function here very shortly.
[00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:20.574]  When you see the new CDC director crying on television about how they didn't have enough ventilators and how sad she is and please keep your mask and please don't come outside.
[00:05:20.594 --> 00:05:28.944]  I know what it's like when you're the physician, when you're the healthcare provider and you're worried that you don't have the resources to take care of the patients in front of you.
[00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:39.589]  I know that feeling of nausea when you read the crisis standards of care and you wonder whether there are going to be enough ventilators to go around and who's going to make that choice.
[00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:46.658]  And I know what it's like to pull up to your hospital every day and see the extra morgue sitting outside.
[00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:56.954]  That's because if the blue cities and blue states see the red states like Florida and Texas reopen and have lower death tolls and be healthy, they'll demand freedom as well.
[00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:58.734]  But it doesn't matter, the numbers are out.
[00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:03.396]  All the states, all the countries that didn't do the lockdowns had almost no deaths or problems.
[00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:11.238]  It was only people locked into their homes in the winters, wearing masks, getting bacterial pneumonia, and they knew it all along.
[00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:20.903]   Fauci wrote a paper about it in 2008, that almost all the death of the Spanish flu In 1917, 1918 was caused by the mask wearing.
[00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:25.347]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:32.253]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:41.141]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.243]  It is easier to kill than to control.
[00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:52.338]  If you go back to 2006 and 2007, Lou Dobbs and his CNN news program were the number one news program in the US, probably the world.
[00:06:52.418 --> 00:06:54.798]  And he was a populist and an anti-globalist.
[00:06:54.878 --> 00:07:11.181]  And he got the documents via Judicial Watch, where they were meeting up at Banff, Canada, bringing in a world government, where they said, all these corporate chiefs were going to bring in a corporate world government through the UN, bypassing national and state governments, using the threat of a deadly virus.
[00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:19.647]   Then the shutdown will create Incredible starvation of the third world and giant migrant waves will then invade the West.
[00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:29.454]  We'll say it's global warming that's causing it and then make the nation states go under UN control to stop the giant refugee flow of tens of millions.
[00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:33.518]  And then we'll have world government, corporate world government.
[00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:39.562]  Well, here we are in the year 2021 and it's happening in front of our eyes and Klaus Schwab is admitting it.
[00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:41.124]  It's not even hidden.
[00:07:42.082 --> 00:08:02.910]  Now we see the FBI waiving the federal law, a power they don't have, and saying that people that work at these refugee centers and the foster care parents that get to 26 children apiece don't have to even pass background checks, legalizing human smuggling and the trafficking of children, in many cases, to convicted sex offenders.
[00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:12.193]  This is what the UN's been caught all over the world doing, is running giant human trafficking, including children, to sex offenders and others.
[00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:15.135]  The United Nations was set up by the Rockefellers.
[00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:20.797]  The United Nations was set up by the globalists to bring in this corporate world tyranny you see today.
[00:08:21.477 --> 00:08:27.543]  They're using the threat of an exaggerated virus and the giant collapse of the third world to conquer the planet.
[00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:33.068]  This is global government creating a global problem to bring in absolute global control.
[00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:46.221]  At the same time, big tech and mainstream media are working around the clock to silence opposition, to censor, to boycott, to de-platform, to take bank accounts away from InfoWars, the NRA, and even President Trump.
[00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:48.501]  I would like to tell you that this is worse.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.680]   and the New York Times all this week have called for us to be banned off the
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.489]  internet and not be allowed to even have merchant accounts.
[00:08:56.489 --> 00:09:00.800]   Ladies and gentlemen tyranny is a coming. Tyranny is here and as the Holocaust
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.120]   survivor said this is more insidious because it's tyranny saying it's doing it
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.280]  for your own good.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:15.630]  I would like to tell you that this is worse. It is more insidious.
[00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.960]   It concerns and small people.
[00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:33.201]  It is, it is, there is a hypocrisy in the public narrative that is absolutely unbearable to say that we're doing this to protect the old.
[00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:35.441]  My friends, I'm not here to scare you.
[00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:36.242]  I'm here to tell you the truth.
[00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:37.602]  I believe you're strong.
[00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:38.823]  I believe you're not a coward.
[00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:43.065]  And I believe you deserve to know the truth so you can prepare to take it on.
[00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:43.845]  Head on.
[00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:45.545]  They're not coming after me.
[00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:47.146]  They're coming after you.
[00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:52.088]  They just need to get through me to get to you, and that's why they hate InfoWars so much.
[00:09:52.688 --> 00:09:53.669]  It's time to fight back.
[00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:56.290]  And your word of mouth is king in this fight.
[00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.711]  So take this report from Bandot Video.
[00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:02.353]  And make sure this warning gets out across the world.
[00:10:02.553 --> 00:10:03.173]  Use your email.
[00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:04.094]  Use your text message.
[00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:05.154]  Use your word of mouth.
[00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:09.377]  And tell people the truth lives at man.video and infowars.com.
[00:10:09.617 --> 00:10:14.500]  And then tell them to research this information, discover it's true, and then share it with others.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.783]  That domino effect, that chain reaction, will defeat the globalists.
[00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:19.843]  We don't have a choice.
[00:10:20.524 --> 00:10:22.085]  The more we submit, the worse it gets.
[00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:25.727]  The more we resist, the more our enemies will be defeated.
[00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:29.598]  Never forget, we have the power, but we must exercise it.
[00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:33.697]   Never forget, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:46.737]   I want to encourage listeners and I want to encourage viewers to do something about the
[00:10:46.737 --> 00:10:48.858]  globalist takeover.
[00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:57.218]   And there's no other place out there That is really developing a plan to block the globalists and to expose their operations completely.
[00:10:58.198 --> 00:11:01.199]  That is doing it at any level similar to Infowars.
[00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:09.522]  But the enemy knows that Infowars, nine times out of ten, is the genesis point of major resistance movements that are devastating the New World Order's operations.
[00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:10.803]  But let me just tell you this.
[00:11:11.123 --> 00:11:14.564]  Do not sit there and expect Infowars to be here forever.
[00:11:14.584 --> 00:11:21.887]   And this operation has a giant globalist squid attached to us Gnawing on our face, okay?
[00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:24.409]  I'm laying eggs real fast escape pods too.
[00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:29.432]  We'll just see how they do getting caught in the whole underwater jet stream here and what they'll grow into and what they'll do.
[00:11:29.552 --> 00:11:35.796]  So I need energy to be able to make sure that all those things that we're ensuring in the future continue on because that's the main mission.
[00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:43.401]  I give you my word that I will be as focused and hardcore as I can until the very end, but I need financial support at InfoWarstore.com.

[00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.802]   Because some things are selling out or off the list we are adding four things
[00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:26.362]  that are very close to selling out.
[00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:28.994]  This is the original, best-selling Deep Earth Crystal, highest quality, good halogen iodine you're going to find.
[00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:33.097]  You have to get a DEA license to even get this, to be able to manufacture it until it's put in this state.
[00:12:33.137 --> 00:12:35.038]  It's not under DEA control because it's a precursor.
[00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:40.162]  Obviously, a lot of things, it's so essential to the entire body, so essential to so many chemical things in the body and in nature.
[00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:41.523]  It's that magic.
[00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:44.144]  It's 50% off X3 as the Deep Earth Crystal.
[00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:45.565]  Two other types that are also healthy.
[00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:47.227]  Some people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[00:12:47.327 --> 00:12:51.529]  Most people cannot absorb the other types of iodine, but X3 is for folks that want something different.
[00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:52.690]  It's different for different folks.
[00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.171]  Try it out.
[00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:07.120]  This is the strongest surface sanitizer you're gonna find out there.

[00:13:11.203 --> 00:13:14.526]  This is super great, super industrial nascent iodine.
[00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:16.987]  No one has ever come out with something like this that's nascent.
[00:13:17.007 --> 00:13:19.189]  They use this in hospitals everywhere else, similar types.
[00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:21.290]  This is for surface like stainless steel porcelain.
[00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.491]  It's 50% off nascent iodine surface spray.
[00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:24.972]  High-powered cleaning agent.
