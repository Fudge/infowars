[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:07.413]  In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:12.736]  Prince Philip, reported by Deutsche Press-Agentur DPA, August 1988.
[00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:23.903]  Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, and brother of Julian Huxley, gave a speech at Berkeley in 1962, shortly before his death.
[00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:35.326]   He admitted, That his best-selling book, Brave New World, written in 1932, was based not on fiction, but on what the elite were actually planning to implement.
[00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:40.329]  Everything I do is a cure for our current situation.
[00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.771]  Wait, how's it a cure if you're killing people?
[00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:44.572]  I told you it does not kill.
[00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:47.714]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:50.436]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:57.404]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations.
[00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:05.329]  The busy, endless global assembly line of babies will grind to a halt.
[00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:18.809]  Why do the globalists over and over and over again show us what they're going to do to us in comic books, in science fiction, in movies?
[00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.371]  Well, there's a lot of reasons that they do that.
[00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.673]  I'm going to explain the field right here.
[00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:44.140]   But this particular case of Utopia 2020, a remake of a British sci-fi show from 2013 that aired last year via the production system of Amazon, Literally mirrors what's actually happening in reality.
[00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:46.362]  Now, why are they doing that?
[00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.404]  I'm gonna explain in a moment, because if you understand this, you understand everything.
[00:01:51.685 --> 00:02:00.490]  Amazon's show plot features fake virus, global vaccine program to sterilize world population.
[00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:08.014]  And he explains, I'm about to play about four minutes from the TV show here, why they're doing it.
[00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:16.646]  You learn that we're going to trick people to opt into a vaccine and that it's not going to kill them right away.
[00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:29.751]  It's going to sterilize them and they're going to pass this virus on that causes sterilization for at least three generations until the world population is held at 500 million.
[00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.932]  Well, what's on the Georgia Guidestones?
[00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:34.093]  500 million.
[00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:34.513]  That's what?
[00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:46.407]  The globalist group set up by Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, Prince Charles, and of course the man that paid for the Georgia Geist stones, Ted Turner, have openly said they're going to do it.
[00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:51.309]  They're the good guy club, the billionaire club that wants to set up world government to depopulate the planet.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:04.584]  And so they want to tell you in these films, so that some of the public, when they get warned about what's happening, Lime Tom will say, Oh, you just got that from Black Mirror, the social credit score that we told you was coming 15 years ago, long before Black Mirror.
[00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:11.646]  Oh, you just got that from the Amazon show, Utopia 2020.
[00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:15.328]  So people then think it's theater.
[00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.751]  They think it's fiction when we're warning them about the real plot.
[00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:24.353]  And all these top scientists and white papers are out, as you know, that the vaccine isn't a vaccine.
[00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:28.976]  It makes you create spike proteins that attack fertility, and it will pass this on for generations.
[00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.037]  That's what the scientists have said clearly.
[00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:40.523]  So here they are in a film that's produced at the beginning of the pandemic and put out during the middle of it.
[00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:42.575]  Mirroring what's really happening.
[00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:47.717]  And then you have all the real globals publications saying, oh, the lockdowns are good for the Earth.
[00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:48.517]  It cuts carbon.
[00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:50.318]  Oh, people aren't having as many kids during lockdown.
[00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:50.738]  That's good.
[00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:53.820]  We need regular climate lockdowns because humans are bad.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.381]  They're hitting you at every level.
[00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:04.005]  And it's an excuse for these globals to take full control of all human development, not just, quote, save the planet from overpopulation.
[00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.306]  And they also like to tell the world.
[00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.071]  In a very thinly veiled way what they're doing and why they're doing it.
[00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:13.793]  So we're in the process of this depopulation.
[00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:16.395]  We're in the process of this mass culling.
[00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:23.280]  We're in the process of the social contract being broken where no one's going to trust medicine or governments again.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.542]  And that also adds the horrible dystopia that's unfolding.
[00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:30.948]  So here is five minutes or so from the show.
[00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:34.713]  If you're a radio listener, it's posted at Bandawavideo and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:35.734]  I suggest you share it.
[00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:40.453]   I suggest you share with my little intro here so people can understand the perspective of
[00:04:40.453 --> 00:04:42.974]  why these people continue to carry this out.
[00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:47.013]   And then I hope you'll actually see my film, Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavement, that's
[00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:52.594]   free in the Infowars documentary section of Bandai Video that I made 14 years ago that
[00:04:52.594 --> 00:04:56.314]   shows all the actual documents and video and proof of this plan because this is the future
[00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:57.314]  of the world.
[00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:01.193]   They've hijacked the future and I think we should at least know what's going on.
[00:05:01.214 --> 00:05:02.134]  You've desecrated all of my work!
[00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:05.935]  put in our two cents on this operation that's taking place.
[00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:11.435]   But this is all out in the open right now, and so here is an excerpt where the star of the show,
[00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:15.973]   the mad scientist, is explaining what they're doing to the world and how they're really giving us a great gift.
[00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:20.375]   And I guess if we don't care and don't stand up, we kind of do deserve what happens to us.
[00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.473]  How much evil do you have to do to do good?
[00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:26.334]  You've desecrated all of my work.
[00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:29.493]  You've disrespected science.
[00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:33.074]  What the hell did you put in that vaccine?
[00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:34.074]  [splat]
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.503]  He created a flu that sparked a demand for a vaccine that doesn't work.
[00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:41.105]  After everyone in the country is vaccinated... And the world?
[00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:43.247]  He'll have murdered millions.
[00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:44.527]  Nope, nope, you don't have it.
[00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:49.151]  Give a certain percentage of the population a fatal illness, and you make sure it's genetic.
[00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.952]  See, that was the exciting part.
[00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:51.652]  You pass it down.
[00:05:52.013 --> 00:05:53.594]  So if you have children before you die...
[00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.252]  And when this vaccine fails, I'll be the scapegoat.
[00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:02.834]  People are driven by the need to know what happens next.
[00:06:03.294 --> 00:06:04.795]  Do you want to know what happens next?
[00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:18.444]  Your father created a world-changing, not world-ending, a world-changing, world-improving Omnivirus.
[00:06:19.664 --> 00:06:23.507]  And we have taken that virus and embedded it in the vaccine of the Stern's Flu.
[00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:26.961]  I knew it.
[00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:29.883]  He created a panic and now everybody's begging for the vaccine.
[00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:30.383]  No, no, no.
[00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.284]  Demanding it.
[00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:32.344]  Yes.
[00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:35.206]  And now we have exactly what we want.
[00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:42.029]  Hundreds of millions of Americans lining up, offering us their arms and letting us give them our creation.
[00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:47.012]  I'm pretty sure when every vaccinated person starts dying, they'll trace it back to you, undetectable virus or not.
[00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:48.373]  You've all been very busy.
[00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.493]  You're all very sharp.
[00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.434]  Are you sure none of you would like to come and work for me?
[00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:52.875]  No?
[00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:56.885]  Better than dying a terrible, violent death?
[00:06:58.987 --> 00:06:59.848]  Then understand this.
[00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.752]  What we are doing is far bigger than death.
[00:07:05.453 --> 00:07:05.633]  Wait.
[00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:08.416]  This virus is not deadly.
[00:07:08.836 --> 00:07:10.258]  It looks pretty damn deadly.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.000]  Tell me this.
[00:07:15.483 --> 00:07:16.384]  What have you done today?
[00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.298]  Earn your place in this crowded world.
[00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:21.179]  Exactly.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.363]  Everything I do is a cure for our current situation.
[00:07:26.744 --> 00:07:28.765]  Wait, how's it a cure if you're killing people?
[00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.567]  I told you it does not kill.
[00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.689]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.612]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:43.357]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations.
[00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:51.499]  The busy, endless, global assembly line of babies will grind to a halt.
[00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:54.743]  You're sterilizing people?
[00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:55.824]  Uh-huh.
[00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:03.592]  In the first five years, we'll start to see major birth rate declines as teenagers vaccinated stay in their childhood.
[00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:07.272]  controlling the future of human civilization.
[00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:08.472]  Is that what they're calling it?
[00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:13.271]   It's a very nice euphemism for a species that is replicated like a contagion across the planet,
[00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.271]  killing all other species in its wake.
[00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:19.271]  Except things that are cute, like puppies or koalas.
[00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.272]  You hate people that much?
[00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:23.272]  On the contrary, I love people.
[00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:24.272]  Then how? Why would you?
[00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:27.672]   Doing what our government or citizenry is too spoiled or self-indulgent to do.
[00:08:27.803 --> 00:08:30.005]  We are saving ourselves from ourselves.
[00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.587]  Halting overpopulation.
[00:08:32.607 --> 00:08:36.230]  100 years ago, the global population was 1.7 billion.
[00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:39.333]  2011, it reached 7 billion.
[00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.755]  People live too long, die less often.
[00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.536]  In 2050, they say it's gonna plateau.
[00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:48.981]  We'll blow past 11 billion and then slowly begin to decline.
[00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:53.123]  Global warming, mass extinctions, food-water shortages.
[00:08:53.623 --> 00:08:55.724]  All these problems can be boiled down to one thing.
[00:08:56.565 --> 00:08:57.625]  Overpopulation.
[00:08:57.785 --> 00:09:02.147]  At 1.7 billion, we can be as decadent, self-indulgent as 10 billion.
[00:09:02.748 --> 00:09:04.048]  We have to live strategically.
[00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:06.049]  We have to live modestly.
[00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.191]  What about what this does to people, society?
[00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:10.272]  Salvation.
[00:09:10.932 --> 00:09:12.133]  We can form a new society.
[00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.254]  And you're beta testing it on Americans, since we're the worst.
[00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:15.894]  Mm-hmm.
[00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:17.954]  The Grand Social Experiment.
[00:09:17.954 --> 00:09:28.954]   We can source and get all the supplements we want out of China, but they're dirty and
[00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:32.194]  they've got problems and they're adulterated.
[00:09:32.142 --> 00:09:36.825]  So we could sell our products at a fraction of the price we do, but instead we source them in North America.
[00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:44.791]  Some of the stuff comes from Europe, some of it from South America, but it's from the top apothecaries, you know, the top good facilities in the world.
[00:09:45.972 --> 00:09:47.693]  And so it doesn't come from China.
[00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:50.194]  I'll tell you, when it comes to shortwave radios, they're all from China.
[00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:51.035]  You can't find them.
[00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:52.856]  We used to sell Grundig that was made in Germany.
[00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:54.217]  That went out of business like 10 years ago.
[00:09:54.357 --> 00:09:56.538]  I was a Grundig dealer and people didn't buy enough Grundigs.
[00:09:56.558 --> 00:09:57.178]  It went out of business.
[00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:59.800]  So when people used to say to Trump, hey, why are your ties made in China?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.261]  He's like, uh, there'd be three times more they were made in America.
[00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:08.725]  I'm trying to do a deal where it would be half the cost, uh, that it currently is in America, still more expensive than China.
[00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:09.666]  And he did that.
[00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:14.488]  But then those unfair deals that he got rid of have been put right back in place.
[00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:16.850]  So that's how this whole scam operates.
[00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.131]  Most of our products are made right here in America.
[00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:21.313]  The t-shirts are textiled here in America.
[00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:22.854]  They are printed here in America.
[00:10:22.874 --> 00:10:27.917]  I think some of the textiles we use sometimes, if there's a shortage because of the shutdown, we had to buy some from like Honduras.
[00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:30.538]  We got some from Vietnam, but they're becoming more capitalist.
[00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:40.765]  I mean, that's another problem we've experienced with the COVID lockdown is that economies that aren't command and control like China, when they shut down for over a year, most of our companies that we were getting supply from couldn't supply anymore.
[00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:42.266]  And so that causes supply chain breakdown.
[00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:44.668]  That's why the products we do have, we need folks to get them.
[00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:47.190]  Plus they're great products because that funds our operation.
[00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.612]  And so there's a lot of great deals at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:55.778]  But while you're there, got some great new t-shirts that are out, not just Save the Frogs, but some other ones that are really great conversation pieces.
[00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:59.741]  It takes a lot of money, especially in this inflationary economy, as you know, to stay on air.
[00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:01.222]  You can also support us.
[00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:03.744]  You can donate right at the top of InfoWarStore.com.
[00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:08.847]  And you can just see support us become a sponsor, and that's viewers like you, listeners like you.
[00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:10.508]  Go give $5, $20, $100.
[00:11:11.228 --> 00:11:13.069]  Sign up consecutively each month.
[00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:16.211]  Cancel any time for free, but that way you don't forget each month to give us $10.
[00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:19.853]  That way we get $9.50 or whatever, because there's some fees.
[00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:26.316]  Instead of just, you know, making 30, 40% off of, say, we sell up some vitamins and minerals for $30, and then we get like $12, $13.
[00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:27.556]  That sounds great.
[00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:34.441]   Then we discount even less, and then after all the overhead and all the issues, I end up spending a lot of my time just trying to raise funds, which I'm not complaining about.
[00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:37.724]  I'm just saying we're doing important work, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:11:37.744 --> 00:11:41.948]  But just remember InfoWarsTore.com, and while you're there, sign up for AutoShip.
[00:11:41.988 --> 00:11:46.012]  That way, you can cancel any time, order out every month, every two months, every three months.
[00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:47.413]  That way, products you really like...
[00:11:48.234 --> 00:11:49.214]  Keep coming back in.
[00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:50.555]  Don't want to get any more?
[00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:51.215]  Just cancel it.
[00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:51.655]  It's free.
[00:11:52.035 --> 00:11:55.176]  But that way, it's on auto-ship as well, so you keep supporting us.
[00:11:55.256 --> 00:12:01.478]  And don't forget, because I'm really bad about supporting something I want to support, and then getting busy and forgetting about it, and then you turn around and it's gone.
[00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:02.598]  Like, oh, I love that restaurant.
[00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:03.598]  Well, enough folks didn't go there.
[00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:04.219]  It's shut down.
[00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:05.039]  Please keep us on air.
[00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:11.781]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
