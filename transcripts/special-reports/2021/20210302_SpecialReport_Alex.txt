[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.452]  It has been said by Republican and Democrat presidents alike.
[00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.235]  It's been said by political historians over and over again, because it's true.
[00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.617]  As Texas goes, so goes the rest of the nation.
[00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:24.642]   And within hours of Governor Abbott saying he's going to lift the unconstitutional mask mandate and open businesses up 100 percent, All these other states began to follow suit, because that's the leadership of Texas.
[00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:28.284]  That's why it's so sad that Governor Abbott went along with this hoax.
[00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:31.846]  But now he's come out and said the restrictions are lifted.
[00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.727]  But these are restrictions that were not passed by the legislature.
[00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:37.769]  These are restrictions that violate the state and federal constitution.
[00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.990]  They were frauds the entire time.
[00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:51.330]   And it's just now that the public began to wake up to this and resist it, and the courts began to challenge it, and the legislature prepared to convene to block it, that Governor Abbott Pulled back from his previous activity.
[00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:57.831]   So in my view this does not clear Governor Abbott of what he's done, helping the globalists bankrupt the state.
[00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:13.331]  [Music]
[00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:18.831]   Winter Sun Plus is the highest grade of vitamin D3 you're going to find with vitamin K,
[00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:20.831]  for your immune system, for your overall well-being.

[00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:32.348]  It's selling out, 50% off, promo code SUN at infowarestore.com.
[00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.512]  It is now time to open Texas 100%.
[00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.073]  Everybody who wants to work should have that opportunity.
[00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:50.076]  Every business that wants to be open should be open.
[00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:58.242]  Effective next Wednesday, all businesses of any type are allowed to open 100%.
[00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:06.661]  100%.
[00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.141]  That includes any type of entity in Texas.
[00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:15.502]  Also, I am ending the statewide mask mandate.
[00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.502]  [applause]
[00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:42.571]  Well, the day finally came, March 2nd, 2021, after a year of lockdowns and businesses being closed and hundreds of thousands of family businesses and operations shuttering their doors forever, Governor Abbott has followed in the footsteps of Governor DeSantis of Florida and Governor Noem, of course, of South Dakota, and set a 100% order to reopen the state and no mask mandate.
[00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:44.412]  Now, there's a lot to unpack there.
[00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:50.237]  First off, why should the governor be in control of whether we wear masks over our faces, or whether local businesses are open?
[00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:51.878]  And the whole thing's based on a fraud.
[00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:58.962]  Almost all the deaths were cancer, and heart attacks, and car wrecks, and pneumonia, and the flu, which they said doesn't exist this year anywhere in the world.
[00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:01.727]  The UK didn't have one case of flu.
[00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:03.148]  Folks, all this is a fraud.
[00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:06.910]  The same number of people roughly died in 2020, died in 2019.
[00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.811]  And so this hoax is wearing out.
[00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.292]  And thank God, Texas has some history of freedom.
[00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:15.894]  So unlike California, unlike New York, we had already partially reopened.
[00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:25.840]  But the idea that we're lucky that he's next Wednesday, because I guess as one of the crew members, Rob said, COVID-19 is going to fly out of town from Austin, the capital, next Tuesday.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:36.446]  So again, this arbitrary idea that he's God, he's the king, and because the vaccines have worked so well, and because the numbers of cases are down so much, now he can reopen things.
[00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.108]  It's the PCR test that the inventor said years ago is fake.
[00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.529]  It's not for viral tests.
[00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.049]  96% fake, 94% fake.
[00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.410]  Even the New York Times admits.
[00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:54.495]  If they could find this virus in you at all, and with PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.
[00:03:54.835 --> 00:04:00.258]  It starts making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained in everything else, right?
[00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:13.111]   I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of
[00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:14.082]  them in your body, okay?
[00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:18.961]   So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful. Those tests are all
[00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:25.562]   based on things that are invisible and they are the results are inferred in a sense. PCR is separate from that.
[00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:29.102]   It's just a process that's used to make a whole lot of something out of something.
[00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.622]  That's what it is.
[00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:38.298]  It doesn't tell you that you're sick and it doesn't tell you that the thing you ended up with really was going to hurt you or anything like that.
[00:04:38.438 --> 00:04:50.685]  Anytime they want to turn down the test to say, oh look, you're doing better, you took your vaccine, later turn it back up with the devil strain out of Brazil or the hell strain or the atomic strain.
[00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:52.465]  It's like an atomic bomb.
[00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:53.286]  Why?
[00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:56.988]  We're going to have 15 million dead people in the U.S.
[00:04:57.648 --> 00:04:58.929]  Remember within just a few months?
[00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.050]  Remember that last year?
[00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:01.952]  And a million haven't died.
[00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:05.114]  It's like 600,000 and most of those died of something else.
[00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:08.917]  So Abbott went along with Governor Newsom.
[00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:10.479]  He went along with Governor Cuomo.
[00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:17.284]  He did the whole thing of like, don't go see your families in nursing homes, but oh, we can send COVID patients in there.
[00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:25.411]  He's not as bad as some of the Democrats, as Wolf and as others, but at the same time, it's a day late.
[00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:27.504]  It's a dollar short.
[00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:38.583]  And he's under so much heat from the power outages in Texas where he let the feds keep our power off that he's now trying to backtrack because he realizes the public has awakened.
[00:05:38.603 --> 00:05:39.264]  So understand this.
[00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:42.573]  I hope Abbott gets his head screwed on straight.
[00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:43.854]  I hope he has a come-to-Jesus moment.
[00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:46.877]  I hope he stops being a globalist, but that doesn't really matter at the end of the day.
[00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:56.726]  You need to know that the plan all over the world by the UN, by Klaus Schwab, by Bill Gates, is to put restrictions on and then kind of back off for a while, but next time bring them down even harder.
[00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:07.124]   And the same thing has happened in Australia, it's happened in Spain, it's happened in the UK, that every time they bring restrictions down, Then they back off.
[00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:08.044]  Then they bring them back.
[00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:09.345]  It only gets worse the next time.
[00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:10.767]  This is a power grab.
[00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:19.574]  This is a world ID with QR codes to eat at restaurants and QR codes for kids to go to school and inoculations for children to go to school run by Microsoft.
[00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:30.662]  Microsoft runs this all the way from the UN, all the way from the Wuhan Lab, all the way from the WHO, down to the QR codes for your kids to go to school and the QR codes to get on airplanes.
[00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:35.166]  Now Israel's got people wearing, quote, freedom bracelets when they get back to Israel.
[00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:38.847]  While they're locked in their houses on house arrest.
[00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.208]  So they don't have to go to an Israeli military base for two weeks.
[00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:48.130]  This is the state taking control of our lives like a pimp beats up the prostitute to keep her in line.
[00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.431]  And this is not going to end well.
[00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:52.051]  So everybody's so happy.
[00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.051]  Yay!
[00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.532]  They're taking the restrictions off.
[00:06:54.972 --> 00:07:05.727]  Boris Johnson's done that and then brought him right back later when there's a new deadly devil strain, an atomic weapon strain, a murder strain, an end of the world strain, we're all gonna die strain!
[00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:16.162]  All it is is the common cold that they own and they control that they can never have a vaccine for because you can't have a vaccine for the common cold because it mutates so much.
[00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:19.703]  That's why Merck two months ago pulled out of the vaccine saying it doesn't work.
[00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:27.005]  That's why South Africa and India and Switzerland and all these countries have pulled out of the vaccine because they don't work and more countries are pulling out.
[00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:28.146]  And the majority of U.S.
[00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:28.947]  troops are saying no.
[00:07:29.207 --> 00:07:33.072]  The good news is humanity is awakening and seeing through this U.N.
[00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:36.656]  global corporate power grab fraud that is the Great Reset.
[00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.320]  The good news is not that Greg Abbott after a year is going to...
[00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:43.376]  Loosen up the noose around our neck for a little while.
[00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:53.805]  Because you mark my words, if we don't stay on his ass, if we don't keep exposing COVID-19 as a fraud, if we don't keep speaking out against the Great Reset, they're gonna bring it back even here in Texas.
[00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:59.950]  Governor DeSantis and the Governor of South Dakota, Noem, are the answer to this problem.
[00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.232]  Expose the whole thing as a fraud, take the mask off forever.
[00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:06.934]  And in the blue cities and blue states, they're going to keep them on.
[00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:11.114]  In Austin, in San Antonio, in Houston and Dallas, all run by Democrats.
[00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:14.555]  You watch, they're going to keep them on because they love to virtue signal.
[00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:15.795]  They love to be gimps.
[00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:17.176]  They love to be slaves.
[00:08:17.376 --> 00:08:19.316]  They love to show the fact they're subservient.
[00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:20.136]  They enjoy it.
[00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:21.577]  They're not Americans.
[00:08:21.997 --> 00:08:23.617]  They are into being cucks.
[00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:25.257]  They are into being minions.
[00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:42.582]   And so it's important to boycott those companies, boycott those cities, and support the companies, and support the systems like What you have in Florida, in Naples, with the Oaks grocery stores, and to give support to people that are pro-human, not support to companies that are globalist.
[00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:47.884]  You saw China get more billionaires than all countries combined last year during the lockdown.
[00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:53.946]  You saw big tech that ran the lockdown double and triple their profits, and in some cases double the size of their companies.
[00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:58.848]  This was engineered, and the minute you start waking up to that is the minute things turn around.
[00:08:59.108 --> 00:08:59.848]  So here's the video.
[00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:04.890]  Alex Jones responds to Governor Abbott supposedly unlocking the state.
[00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.252]  Whoever said he had the power to circumvent the Constitution and Bill of Rights outside the state legislature?
[00:09:10.552 --> 00:09:11.792]  He didn't have that power.
[00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:13.873]  They don't have that power anywhere in the world.
[00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:17.614]  So whatever amount of tyranny you put up with is the amount of tyranny you live under.
[00:09:17.854 --> 00:09:19.095]  This thing has just begun.
[00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:21.716]  And yes, this is a small victory because we're pushing back.
[00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:31.061]  But we have to push back even harder against the general fraud or our new way of life is martial law under medical tyranny with poisonous vaccines.
[00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:40.988]  For so long, a large portion of our audience thought that we were engaged in fear porn.
[00:09:41.608 --> 00:09:42.929]  They thought we were exaggerating.
[00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.490]  That's not happening now.
[00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.572]  People realize that we were telling you the truth about what was going on.
[00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:53.293]   Now the majority of our audience were veterans and firefighters and police and business people.
[00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:54.972]  They'd already experienced the real world.
[00:09:54.972 --> 00:09:59.253]   They had seen what we were talking about for themselves, so they knew we weren't lying.
[00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:03.173]   But to a lot of folks, especially young people that thought this was extreme or made up,
[00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:04.812]  now you realize it's not a joke.
[00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.491]  No ladies and gentlemen, it's not a joke.
[00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:09.932]   And now that everything we've talked about is coming true, InfoWars is more important
[00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:10.932]  than ever.
[00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:14.652]   We're doing more good in a month staying on air than we used to do in ten years.
[00:10:14.728 --> 00:10:15.789]  This is our time.
[00:10:16.109 --> 00:10:18.950]  The new world order is out in the open and we're going to end up beating them in the end.
[00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:24.313]  But I want to keep InfoWars in the mission and in the attack for truth and justice as long as possible.
[00:10:24.653 --> 00:10:28.435]  So please spread the word about the broadcast and please buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:32.356]  We've got free shipping right now for only one more week and who knows how long we'll be here.
