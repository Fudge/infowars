[00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:10.659]  The National Security Agency has put out a statement saying they never spied on Tucker Carlson.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.528]  Well, it's on record that the NSA and the CIA spied on the Senate over a decade ago when they were investigating CIA torture.
[00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:25.647]   And of course it turned out under Obama, there was record level persecution of
[00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:31.966]   whistleblowers and members of the press, hundreds of which were put in prison for
[00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:38.007]   doing the same things that Daniel Ellsberg did with the Pentagon Papers.
[00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.807]   And that is investigating illegal activity, which is protected under whistleblower law.
[00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:50.947]   And so to think that the Biden administration and these agencies aren't investigating Tucker when he's got
[00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:57.126]   whistleblowers on about illegal spying, about torture, about censorship,
[00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:02.807]   about criminal activity, about the FBI having provocateurs inside the January 6th
[00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:06.126]  operation is asinine.
[00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:15.297]  And remember, the former head of these intelligence agencies, he headed up several, Clapper, the former head of the NSA, said, we've never spied on any American, ever.
[00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:23.784]  With all our communications, we know from declassifications, Ed Snowden go through the NSA.
[00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:33.076]  They've got facilities ten times the size of Walmart distribution centers in San Antonio, Texas, and outside Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:40.421]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:40.761]  No, sir.
[00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:41.061]  It does not?
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.900]   The water and the ocean isn't water, and fish don't live in water.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900]  No, sir.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900]  It does not?
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900]  Not wittingly.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.901]  Alright.
[00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:10.443]  They think you're stupid.
[00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:12.384]  They think you're naive.
[00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:25.968]  When the CIA and NSA began getting exposed in the 90s, they simply moved their operations over to big tech that now censors and surveils and controls us and tricks us to have these phones that listen to us, these home assistants.
[00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:27.369]  It's a sick joke.
[00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:32.433]  Of course they're listening to Tucker Carlson, the number one TV host in the United States.
[00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.495]  It came out in the whole Russiagate investigation.
[00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:41.079]  Hell, I got subpoenas and things that Roger Stone was being surveilled, that I was being surveilled.
[00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:47.449]  They were spying on candidate Trump and on president-elect Trump and on him as president.
[00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.736]  And now they sit there and tell you, oh, we're not spying on Tucker Carlson.
[00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:54.718]  You know why that's important?
[00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.401]  Tucker has forced them out in the open.
[00:02:57.574 --> 00:02:58.174]  To deny it.
[00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:17.343]  So that now that they've grabbed him, all his communications, and hundreds and hundreds of different people, his text messages, his emails, when they try to leak that information to the press, just like the FBI did against President Trump, and just like the NSA and Justice Department against Trump, it will now box them in that they denied this was going on.
[00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:19.384]  And again, it's not that Tucker's anything wrong.
[00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:29.222]   They're going through his communications to find anything they can to basically burn whistleblowers that are talking to him and to claim there's some type of impropriety to get him fired from his job.
[00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.446]  This is what they do.
[00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:43.513]   So we salute Tucker Carlson, and we salute Julian Assange, and we salute Edward Snowden, and we salute Infowars.com, and our crew, and our listeners, and the supporters.
[00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:50.998]  Because these agencies think they're God, like Chuckie Schumer said, there's seven ways from Sunday for the intelligence community to get you.
[00:03:51.678 --> 00:03:54.120]  And they live to control our lives.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.783]  It's like in third world countries, you always hear about the federal police takeover.
[00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:58.904]  It's the same thing here.
[00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:02.807]  The Justice Department, the lawyers, the NSA, they have enslaved us.
[00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:12.011]  And they now say the number one terror threat is white conservatives, and that they're going to look inward to suppress us, not the Russians, not the Chinese, not radical Islam.
[00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:13.612]  That is tell-tale tyranny.
[00:04:14.752 --> 00:04:15.853]  That's what brought down Rome.
[00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:17.133]  That's what brought down Venezuela.
[00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:19.995]  That's what brought down so many other great countries.
[00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:25.277]  And they are outrageously trying to launch a domestic war against the American people.
[00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:27.198]  Of course they're surveilling us.
[00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:28.699]  They've declared us all terrorists.
[00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.849]  But they're the ones violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.111]  Remember the Patriot Act was, quote, just for Muslims?
[00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:39.114]  And I said, I don't like radical Islam, but I don't want to take their rights.
[00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:42.557]  Because if you take one group's rights, you take everybody's rights.
[00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:52.085]  And now they're saying anybody that questions elections, anybody that questions gun confiscation, anybody that questions lockdowns is a terrorist in the official policy of my country.
[00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:54.326]  So, of course, we're all under surveillance.
[00:04:54.606 --> 00:05:03.152]  We have a criminal government, hijacked by foreign interests, that has sold the nation out, that is scared of we, the people, because it's an illegitimate government that stole the election.
[00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:07.094]  So it doesn't matter if the NSA tells us we're not spying on you.
[00:05:07.394 --> 00:05:12.098]  We know you are on record, and your denial is now a confirmation.
