[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:21.284]  Take a look at this.
[00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.167]  Cars everywhere.
[00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.969]  Gas cars everywhere.
[00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.231]  And then, boom.
[00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.556]  The electric charging stations for the elite, like you're handicapped.
[00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:38.457]  You're right up front here.
[00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:43.661]  This is Austin High, by Lake Austin.
[00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.577]  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of cars, but no one here using the charging station.
[00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.442]  But with the social conditioning, they try to nudge us into that position.
[00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:16.958]   Now, if this was a good technology at all before, but electric cars blow up, they're toxic, and it takes more carbon, about three times more carbon to build one, That a regular car and most of the power comes from electricity, we're going to lose about half the electricity from the generating station to this point.
[00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:20.481]  From the power lines at the power plant to the point.
[00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.482]  So overall they use on average more carbon.
[00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.723]  Which by the way I think is great.
[00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:24.924]  Carbon is good.
[00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:26.525]  We're carbon based life forms.
[00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:27.626]  That's how the planet operates.
[00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:32.350]  If we go back hundreds of millions of years, the planet had much higher carbon levels, carbon dioxide, you name it.
[00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.233]  Carbon dioxide of course is tied to oxygen production on the planet.
[00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.301]  And so electric vehicle only.
[00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:43.382]  This is all the social credit score in the future.
[00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:53.585]  Once they have the world medical ID, the global vaccine passport, then it will be tied to all your activities.
[00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:57.226]  You'll get a higher credit score for your political activities.
[00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.207]  Forget your son say sterilized.
[00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.947]  That'll get you like five free years of rent.
[00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:01.447]  Seriously.
[00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:07.309]  Uh, if, if you get sterilized a couple of free years of rent, that's a whole voluntary extinction program.
[00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.950]  Paul Ehrlich.
[00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.692]  And so here we go, folks.
[00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:12.533]  It's a whole religion.
[00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.054]  It's a cult of power and control.
[00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:20.558]  Has nothing to do with the environment, but it's like you used to pay the Pope to get your family out of purgatory.
[00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:27.242]  Indulgences, you pay the Rothschilds and the Globalists all this money for the carbon tax that's already being set up around the world.
[00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.784]  And the corporations are implementing the carbon tax whether you like it or not.
[00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.923]  So everybody feels like they're all great and wonderful, but they're not.
[00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.785]  The good news is people understand instinctively it's a fraud.
[00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:40.466]  It's like they always tell us tap water is the best thing to drink.
[00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:48.010]  But people knew it had fluoride and chemicals in it, so in the 80s, filtered water became huge, so people instinctively know they're being poisoned.
[00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.491]  It's the same thing.
[00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:52.512]  So humans know what to adopt at a subconscious level.
[00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:53.753]  They have like a hive mind.
[00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:55.994]  We're individuals, but also we have a group collective.
[00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.615]  Alright, here we are in Austin High, folks.
[00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:02.297]  People do not want the electric cars.
[00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:04.493]  People see through it.
[00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:07.935]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:09.476]  But they don't care.
[00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.557]  Europe's already mandated no gas cars by 2030.
[00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.140]  Incredible.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.081]  They cut carbon off, it'll kill millions.
[00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:19.903]  It's like the lockdowns have killed tens of millions of starvation.

[00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:32.405]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of Vitamin & Mineral Fusion back in stock.
[00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.107]  And it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:40.811]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supplies.
[00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.812]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:48.134]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off, so everybody on the fence will get it.
