[00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.521]  You see this article?
[00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.103]  It's out of Politico.
[00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:11.089]  And it announces what is the equivalent of digital martial law.
[00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.193]  A total suspension of free speech on the internet.
[00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:25.749]   Years ago, CNN's Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy I called for my private text messages to be censored if I was on Facebook's WhatsApp.
[00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:26.309]  I wasn't.
[00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:34.293]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:47.080]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, and a spokesperson could not say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:54.802]  Then I learned that there had been censorship all over the world by Facebook of people's private text messages during political campaigns.
[00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:58.064]  But they hadn't had the nerve yet to do it.
[00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:00.015]  Here in the United States.
[00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:28.707]  Well, in this article from Politico titled, Potentially a Death Sentence, White House Goes Off on Vaccine Fearmongers, we learn from the White House Press Secretary that the DNC is requesting Apple and the Droid manufacturers to give Democrat-approved fact-checkers trained by the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center access to all your private text messages.
[00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:30.598]  Think about that.
[00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:32.479]  They're already in your phone.
[00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:33.920]  They're already surveilling you.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.141]  They're already tracking you with cookies.
[00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:41.286]  They're already reading your private messages on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, including your private nude pics.
[00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:42.387]  That came out years ago.
[00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.591]  They tried to deny it, but Project Veritas got the recordings, and then later they said, okay, yeah, we are, no big deal.
[00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:48.652]  But that's not enough.
[00:01:49.353 --> 00:02:08.381]   Now your text messages to grandma, or your girlfriend, or your husband, or your children, or your doctor, It's all going to be read by them to make sure you're not spreading medical disinformation, like the virus coming from the Wuhan lab, now admitted, or that ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine have 99% recovery rates.
[00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.563]  These are the criminals that ran the Wuhan lab.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:17.747]  And big tech's been investing in these very same big pharma companies, these drug dealing companies.
[00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:20.169]  So this is beyond 1984.
[00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.881]  If they get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.223]  And they're using the pretext of medical disinformation.
[00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:32.687]  It is the right of consumers to say whatever we want about products.
[00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:36.630]  And if we lie about the products, they can sue us, they can win a defamation case.
[00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.691]  But that's not what this is about.
[00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.935]  This is about the Democratic Party that's hijacked America and stolen an election.
[00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:46.824]   that knows the people are awake to it. It's the same thing with the unpopular EU. It's the same
[00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:51.144]   thing with unpopular UN. They've all gotten together to use this hyped up virus as the
[00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:56.583]   pretext for ongoing lockdowns and really martial law, not just digital martial law, but physical
[00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:01.223]   martial law. And they're getting ready with more lockdowns and more control, and they want to be
[00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:06.023]   able to intimidate and censor everybody ahead of that. Also in this article, it says, you know,
[00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:13.464]   there's lies about the plans of those coming door to door to intimidate you or to twist your arm
[00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.984]  to compel inoculation.
[00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:16.297]  And that's just not true.
[00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:27.522]  Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes door-to-door, literally knocking on doors, to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.
[00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:41.098]   And they attack a congressman saying he's a liar, but Fauci was on TV last week saying we need local, mandated, or forced But I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates.
[00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:42.399]  There really should be.
[00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.802]  We're talking about life and death situation.
[00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.972]  They're all over the news on CNN saying we need to punish people and compel them to take it.
[00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:53.133]  I mean, you were mentioning, Chris, about how all these states are reopening.
[00:03:53.413 --> 00:03:55.093]  They're reopening at 100%.
[00:03:55.554 --> 00:04:00.615]  And we have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status.
[00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:04.677]  Because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what's the carrot going to be?
[00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.658]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:13.100]   So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration needs to come So this is true gaslighting.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.941]  They've made an authoritarian move.
[00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.523]  These big corporations, these big banks that own big pharma and big tech, they think the sky's the limit.
[00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:22.023]  going to go out and enjoy these freedoms anyway.
[00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:24.823]  So this is true gaslighting.
[00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:30.423]   They've made an authoritarian move, these big corporations, these big banks that own big pharma and big tech,
[00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:31.663]  they think the sky's the limit.
[00:04:31.663 --> 00:04:33.102]  They think they can do anything they want.
[00:04:33.102 --> 00:04:38.143]   Do you understand that to know what you're saying in your text messages, they have to be reading them?
[00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.393]  And they say, oh don't worry, a person doesn't do it at first.
[00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:44.575]  It's scanned by AI and flagged for a person.
[00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:48.017]  Oh, so no judge, no jury, no warrant.
[00:04:48.258 --> 00:04:59.004]  When I say something that they don't like about the DNC, it's flagged and then some DNC trained person reads what I've said.
[00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:00.766]  This is so insane.
[00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:05.108]  We just had the FBI come out with its new National Threat Assessment of white supremacists everywhere.
[00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:10.710]  They said if you question the election or you question lockdowns, you're a terrorist, you're a white supremacist.
[00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.052]  And they said in an FBI letter to the public, even in tweets they put out, watch your family, watch your neighbors.
[00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:18.413]  Are they extreme?
[00:05:18.913 --> 00:05:20.093]  Do they not trust the government?
[00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:22.514]  Do they have a Lego set of the Capitol?
[00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:26.568]   Because if they do, We're going to come and we're going to arrest them.
[00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:37.232]  This is a declaration of war by corporations that control the Democratic Party and the Republican Party to a great extent, who really want to come out and start a fight with the American people and criminalize dissent.
[00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:43.533]  And if you're going to do that, you've got to have something the Stasi in East Germany and the old NKVD in Russia could only dream of.
[00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:47.554]  And that's lifetime reading of your text messages.
[00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.915]  The truth is they've been doing it for a long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:52.616]  This is a breakaway civilization of corporations.
[00:05:53.018 --> 00:06:02.701]  Violating every law, every form of privacy, whose job it is to keep us alone and depressed, clicking on their ads as much as they can.
[00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:08.582]  This is exploitation and really dopamine dealing or drug dealing to a whole other level.
[00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:13.363]  And it's much bigger than conservative, liberal, Christian, Muslim, agnostic, Jewish, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:15.404]  This is an assault on all of humanity.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:25.587]  And for the left, pretending there's not censorship, or pretending there's not cancel culture, or pretending this isn't classic tyranny with a high-tech overlay, you're delusional.
[00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:32.393]  You're not just delusional about this not happening, you're aiding and abetting it and gaslighting, not just us but yourselves.
[00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:34.715]  This is the next level.
[00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:35.735]  This is the Rubicon.
[00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:43.041]  And this is what comes when they cross the Rubicon and push forced inoculations and new lockdowns.
[00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:44.983]  This is Klaus Schwab's Great Reset.
[00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:52.880]  Just last week, Klaus Schwab and the Australian Health Minister and others said, the lockdowns are never ending.
[00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.521]  And they said, this is the new world order.
[00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:56.881]  This is a world pandemic.
[00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:58.281]  It's a 100 year event.
[00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:02.962]  So you can expect that we will have transmission from time to time.
[00:07:03.062 --> 00:07:04.283]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.423]  We've got to accept that this is the new world order.
[00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.744]  We've got to accept that this is the new world order.
[00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:10.184]  This is the new world order.
[00:07:10.984 --> 00:07:12.565]  And they said, this is the way it is.
[00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:20.132]  And another top health minister in Canada said, oh, we're going to continue the lockdowns so people can't talk about unauthorized things in the streets.
[00:07:20.632 --> 00:07:31.781]  Because you see, if you're working at home over Zoom, or if you're working at home over Skype or over an app, that can all be collated by AI that's already going through and already categorizing and flagging.
[00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:38.167]  But if you're out in a square or in a park demonstrating and speaking, wow, that's humans coming together.
[00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:42.793]   And remember, We've got six feet of separation here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:44.376]  We're not supposed to shake hands anymore.
[00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:45.637]  We're all prisoners.
[00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:50.933]  All prisoners here in the Modern Digital Gulag, we are being inducted into this tyranny.
[00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:52.134]  It's not slow anymore.
[00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:53.294]  It's accelerated.
[00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:54.234]  We've gone off the edge of the cliff.
[00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:59.116]  Let's wake up and come together and say no to this and reject this.
[00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:05.258]  Big Tech finally woke up Bill Maher when they blocked ivermectin that's 99% effective.
[00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:07.839]  He said, hey, this isn't the Republicans you're censoring.
[00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.559]  That's OK.
[00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.199]  This is a drug.
[00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:11.800]  I need to be able to know about this for me.
[00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:18.269]  When we get rid of these safety nets, when we get rid of free speech, when we get rid of common sense, we're all in danger.
[00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:23.974]  Including the oligarchs that are doing this to try to control political parties and movements they don't control.
[00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:25.615]  That's how you get dictatorships.
[00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:31.580]  A party in power is kicked out of power, and so they come back and overthrow the party in power.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.424]  Or a party in power is being thrown out and they don't want to leave, so they bring in martial law and they succeed.
[00:08:36.925 --> 00:08:40.107]  When they do that, you get a tyranny like Cuba or North Korea.
[00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:51.024]  Let's hope we can all come together peacefully and just reject this attempt, but there's no doubt this is a classical attempt at authoritarian takeover, and we're living true history right now.
[00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:52.486]  Raise the alarm, folks!
[00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:54.327]  They're already reading your text messages.
[00:08:54.768 --> 00:09:00.012]  Now they publicly want to censor them, and of course later, also share them.
[00:09:00.512 --> 00:09:03.312]  That's what they're getting everybody ready for right now.
[00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:16.031]  I'm at war with tyranny.
[00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:17.979]  But it doesn't mean that I have all the answers.
[00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:20.340]  It doesn't mean that I figured out every way to defeat them.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.220]  But I know this.
[00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:37.208]   If we reduce our signature, if we take these cell phones that have all these great attributes and all these great services, but also track, trace, and spy on us, and if we lock them up in a little Faraday cage, like the little devils they are, They can't track us.
[00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:38.188]  They can't trace us.
[00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:47.975]  They can't use that data against us for contact tracers, the UN, Joe Biden's people coming to your doors, but also hackers and regular criminals.
[00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:51.757]  So what I do, and I've got a black one, I've got a red one, but I also have it in blue.
[00:09:52.338 --> 00:09:54.599]  I put my little devilish cell phone in it.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.242]  And it also reminds me of how powerful the phone is and how it's surveilling me.
[00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:03.946]  And it makes me reduce my phone time and spend more time with my family.
[00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:05.407]  So when I'm driving in a car.
[00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:16.525]  Or, when I'm going to church, or when I'm at the grocery store, or when I'm not going to use this thing, or I go to bed at night, I remind myself it's a two-edged sword, and I put it right inside this container.
[00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:19.049]  Now, we've been sold out of these for months.
[00:10:19.963 --> 00:10:22.765]  Because of the supply chain breakdowns with the fake COVID lockdowns.
[00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:27.147]  But finally, we got in some big shipments of these babies.
[00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:30.529]  And so I want to encourage you to take action and get off the fence and get them.
[00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:40.095]  Normally we sell them at $19.95, which is massively discounted from $29.95 that this exact same high quality Faraday cage sells all day long.
[00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:47.334]   We're selling it for the first time, 50% off, $14.95 at infowarestore.com in four colors,
[00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:49.334]  black, red, blue, and green.
[00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:51.814]  We've got a bunch of black, a bunch of red, a bunch of blue.
[00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:53.574]  The green is almost sold out.
[00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:54.574]  They're $14.95.
[00:10:54.574 --> 00:10:57.814]  They're a great gift for friends and family.
[00:10:57.814 --> 00:10:59.533]  They're a great conversation piece.
[00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:03.454]  They're all available, massively discounted, at infowarestore.com.
[00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.482]  Let's start taking back control of our lives by becoming conscious.
[00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:12.567]  Let's put these little devilish spy systems in a cage, except when we decide to use them.
