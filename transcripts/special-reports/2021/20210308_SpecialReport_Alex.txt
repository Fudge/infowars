[00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:09.625]  We are about to reveal how the plot from a hit 2007 Hollywood movie with Will Smith predicted much of what is now happening in the year 2021.
[00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:22.373]  In this film, we're about to break down the government develops a supposed cure for cancer and uses a virus delivery system to go into the cells of the body and reprogram the DNA.
[00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:28.177]  Disastrous results then erupt with nightmare consequences.
[00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:30.297]  We're about to lay it out right now.
[00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:34.296]  [Music]
[00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:38.296]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:42.296]  So Dr. Crippen, give it to me in a nutshell.
[00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:45.861]  Well, the premise is quite simple.
[00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:52.267]  Take something designed by nature and reprogram it to make it work for the body rather than against it.
[00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:53.668]  You're talking about a virus?
[00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:54.629]  Indeed, yes.
[00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:55.670]  In this case, the measles.
[00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.289]   virus which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful
[00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.929]   rather than harmful. I find the best way to describe it is if you can imagine your body as a highway
[00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.929]   and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man
[00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:20.170]   imagine the damage that car could cause then if you replace that man with a cop the
[00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.209]   picture changes and that's essentially what we've done. How many people have you
[00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.170]  treated so far?
[00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.168]  Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials in humans so far.
[00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.727]  And how many are cancer-free?
[00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:32.727]  10,009.
[00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:35.671]  So you have actually cured cancer?
[00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:37.615]  Yes, yes.
[00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:52.860]  A lot of listeners, a lot of friends, a lot of people I work with have said, Alex, why haven't you drawn parallels between the hit movie with Will Smith in 2007, I Am Legend, and what's happening with the COVID-19 supposed vaccine?
[00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.103]  And I was like, oh my gosh, I forgot that movie.
[00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:57.044]  It was a really good movie.
[00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:58.345]  And I went back and read the plot.
[00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:03.890]  And then last night I went back and watched the film again, and it completely blew me away.
[00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:18.575]  You have this high-tech company, this big tech company, that comes out with a cure for cancer where they use a measles virus to deliver a re-engineering system into human DNA so you can't get cancer.
[00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:25.560]  And then 90% of the public dies because it creates a virus factory inside the cells.
[00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:40.953]   9% become these killer Psycho vampires zombies and 1% become immune 6 billion people on earth when the infection hit KV had a 90% kill rate.
[00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:50.815]  That's 5.4 billion people dead crashed and bled out dead That's a 1% immunity.
[00:02:51.455 --> 00:03:21.361]   I left 12 million healthy people like you me and Ethan the other 588 million And I'm like, oh my god, I've interviewed all these scientists, all these medical doctors, all these people, and they talk about how mRNA vaccines are a gene therapy not approved by the FDA that were first developed to try to go in and cure cancer.
[00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:27.465]  But because they didn't know the unintended consequences, because they'd have long-term animal or human studies, they didn't do it.
[00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:40.771]  But it turns out they actually have been doing it in China and other areas, and that it causes all sorts of weird mutations and cancer later in the lab rats, in the pigs, in the goats, in the other animals they tested on.
[00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:46.236]  And of course, Communist China has also been doing a lot of secret human testing as well on the Uyghurs and others.
[00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:52.609]  And so I began to read again the plot of the film, and again watch the film, and it totally blew me away.
[00:03:52.649 --> 00:04:04.696]  Because even the writers of Hollywood science fiction talk to scientists, talk to genetic engineers, and they said, what is the most feasible scenario for something to kill a bunch of people or to cause horrible mutations?
[00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:07.898]  And they said, it's basically this gene editing.
[00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.801]  Because they say, oh, mRNA doesn't change your DNA.
[00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:15.603]  It just orders the cell to change the DNA.
[00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:16.164]  Same thing.
[00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:18.027]  But it gets crazier.
[00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:20.949]  I interviewed Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, respected medical doctor.
[00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.070]  She spent a whole hour on the show showing the medical literature.
[00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.233]  The Johnson's and Johnson vaccine is beyond mRNA.
[00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:41.520]  It takes a cold virus with the spike protein of COVID-19 and delivers it through the cell membrane into the mitochondria and then replicates the supposed protein they want to counter it.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:51.645]  And the head of the EU Advisory Commission, Wolfgang Wudarg and others have come out, including the former chief scientist at Pfizer, and said, this is mass human experimentation.
[00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.026]  This is incredibly dangerous.
[00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.867]  It's going to cause massive autoimmune responses.
[00:04:55.927 --> 00:05:00.892]   It's going to cause Not just people to be allergic, it's going to cause the body to attack its own organs.
[00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:05.318]  And very early on, it is killing a lot of people.
[00:05:05.498 --> 00:05:10.103]  I mean, this is a well-designed, well-designed killing tool.
[00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:23.457]   So the problem is, Alex, is that we are injecting mRNA that has a recipe in it to build a protein to make an antibody against the protein that is supposed to keep us healthy and keep us from getting sick.
[00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:26.498]  We have no idea how long the protein is going to last.
[00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.679]  We have no idea how long the antibody is going to be around.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.340]  We have no idea how long the antibody is going to last.
[00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:36.162]  We don't know how long they're going to continue to, the B cells are going to be active.
[00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:48.788]   We have no idea because we have no long-term studies and every single one of those steps Makes you susceptible to illness for the entire population for an unknown period, maybe the rest of your life.
[00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:58.654]  That you may be susceptible to autoimmune disease, shock, allergies, and death from something that is supposed to keep you from getting sick.
[00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:05.258]  What we've discovered is after people get the COVID vaccine, they're saying, oh they got the COVID vaccine but they still died of COVID.
[00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:09.171]   They're dying and they're claiming That it was COVID.
[00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.932]  So this thing is a big jigsaw puzzle.
[00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:11.932]  But what we know is this.
[00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:14.394]  They couldn't ever get any governments to approve this.
[00:06:15.054 --> 00:06:23.139]  So they used the hysteria in China, where this stuff was developed, to now have it approved in the EU, the UK, the US and Australia and a few other countries.
[00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:25.921]   But India They're very scientific and I've studied it.
[00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.321]  South Africa, again, very scientific.
[00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:34.304]  Switzerland, a bunch of countries have banned different mRNA vaccines because they're not vaccines.
[00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:42.266]  They're gene therapy or genetic engineering and it's causing massive cytokine storms, like you're stung by 100 bees.
[00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:45.408]  Or it's causing the body to shut down and attack its own organs.
[00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:49.049]  Or it's just causing people to have horrible, horrible side effects.
[00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.782]  And go through convulsions and become paralyzed, you name it.
[00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:55.087]  And this is all confirmed.
[00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:01.226]  It was the famous, famous baseball player who, after taking the second shot, died.
[00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:01.827]  Hank Aaron.
[00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:06.829]  And the mainstream media lied and said, oh, the coroner said he didn't die of the shot.
[00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.730]  But then his family talked to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.931]  They said, no, he died after the second shot.
[00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:15.233]  And he never had an autopsy.
[00:07:15.273 --> 00:07:16.393]  So it goes on and on and on.
[00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:23.261]   Now the famous commentator and comedian, Ben Stein, A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans, or whatever you are.
[00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:28.324]  I had the COVID booster, the Moderna, about four or five days ago, and I am still feeling wild side effects from it.
[00:07:28.163 --> 00:07:30.163]  Here's a clip of what he had to say.
[00:07:30.163 --> 00:07:36.082]   A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans or whatever you are.
[00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:41.443]   I had the COVID booster, the Moderna, about four or five days ago.
[00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:45.443]  And I am still feeling wild side effects from it.
[00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:51.522]   Like I had the worst flu in the world, extreme shortness of breath, a dizziness, fatigue,
[00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.842]  extremely irrational thinking.
[00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:57.000]  It has just been devastating.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.781]  I'm glad I got it.
[00:07:59.281 --> 00:07:59.922]  Sort of glad.
[00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:00.682]  I don't know.
[00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:03.644]  I'm a little bit glad and also not quite so glad.
[00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:14.031]  But it has just got to be told to the people, us people, we people, us people, that this booster is a killer.
[00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:18.354]  I mean, it's not going to kill you literally, but it is very, very strong.
[00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:18.494]  Beware.
[00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:26.581]  Again, why are the parallels in I Am Legend 2007 so close to what's currently happening?
[00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:30.965]  Because Hollywood goes out to top scientists and gets their help writing these scripts.
[00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:38.091]  And Elizabeth Holmes, right at that time with Bill Gates, was beginning to develop her Theranos rollout.
[00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.756]  Which is like the PCR test, totally fraudulent.
[00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:47.603]  They claimed they could tell if you had cancer, if you had other diseases, way before you developed it.
[00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:49.466]  Turned out it was all a giant scam.
[00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:55.834]  The computer was a fraud, just like Enron did 20 years ago with oil and gas and electricity prices.
[00:08:56.294 --> 00:08:57.476]  So this is big tech!
[00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:13.446]  With all the criminal activity it's involved in, and all the censorship, and all the spying, and all the manipulation, coming in to biotech, coming in to science, coming in to medicine, and just deciding we're like machines, and they can program us.
[00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:20.092]  And it's Bill Gates, the eugenicist, the depopulationist, that says he wants to reduce world population through a forced system.
[00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:22.325]  That is funding the United Nations.
[00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:24.207]  That is funding Hollywood.
[00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:25.409]  That is funding mainstream media.
[00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:30.194]  That is funding and underwriting most major newspapers to tell you these vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:33.237]  But if you go read the inserts, they're not even vaccines.
[00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:36.361]  They come in and they reprogram your body.
[00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:54.069]  So that's why you're seeing life imitate art, because the art that was I Am Legend is based off real concerns that scientists and others have put forward about this type of live manipulation of the human genome, of the DNA, of the body.
[00:09:54.409 --> 00:10:05.057]  Because in almost every case it creates horrible mutations, horrible cancers, horrible autoimmune responses, horrible allergic reactions, and so many other nightmares.
[00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:16.726]  But again, the globalists don't care because they're moving on from pigs and guinea pigs and rats and mice and cows and horses and goats and on to human beings.
[00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:30.064]   So we're all concerned about Unethical testing on great apes and unethical testing on lions and tigers and bears, and I totally agree with you, but what about the unethical testing on us in mass?
[00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:46.075]  But they're claiming, oh, you have free will, you can opt in and do this, but at the same time, they've given liability protection to the vaccine makers and the genetic engineers to now engage in mass testing on us, and they're bullying us and intimidating us into going along with it.
[00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:52.759]   They are testing not just these biological mutagenic systems on us,
[00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:57.759]   but they are also testing the public and the media to see what they can get away with.
[00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:10.759]   Emerging virus leader Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations of Dr. Alice Crippin's once-hailed
[00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.759]  miracle cure for cancer.
[00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:20.330]   So far, almost 5,000 patients treated with the retrofitted virus have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early
[00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.759]  onset of rabies.
[00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.870]  It's my birthday.
[00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:24.689]  have already died.
[00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:28.689]   Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs
[00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.689]  and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols.
[00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:33.689]  It's my birthday.
[00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:37.689]   We are fully confident that Dr. Neville can see us through these two days.
[00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:39.689]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:43.689]   I have read thousands of pages of mainline medical literature.
[00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:47.620]  I've interviewed dozens of doctors, virologists, scientists.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:55.508]  I've watched hundreds of other interviews of top scientists, heads of universities coming out and saying, this is not a vaccine.
[00:11:55.588 --> 00:11:57.049]  This is human experimentation.
[00:11:57.169 --> 00:11:57.770]  It's illegal.
[00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.011]  We've looked at what's in it.
[00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:00.893]  It's not going to protect you from COVID-19.
[00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:23.933]  This is genocide, and they can't believe that this is happening, but then they get shut down by big tech because big tech, whether it's Google or Facebook or Twitter or Apple, especially Facebook and especially Google, are heavily invested with Bill Gates, who has spent his hundreds of billions of dollars tax-free to buy up control of the medical systems of almost every major nation in the world.
[00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:34.319]   But again, the good news is More than a dozen nations have banned these new mRNA vaccines, and more than 30 nations have kicked Bill Gates out because he was caught doing illegal experimentation.
[00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:35.900]  You ask, why are they doing it?
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:46.065]  It's so reckless, because they've never gotten in trouble, and because they have liability protection, and because they have a desire to play God, and they want to manipulate your DNA.
[00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:54.249]  Bill Gates is a big shareholder in Monsanto that has hundreds of plants they've patented, they own, that now produce seeds that don't produce seeds.
[00:12:54.989 --> 00:12:57.491]  They don't just want the plants with the Terminator system.
[00:12:57.772 --> 00:13:06.520]  They want humans to be sterile and you've got to go to the corporations to be able to have a child and then they put back doors into your child just like they do into our cell phones.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.121]  It's called a Trojan horse.
[00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:13.226]  And that's what Hollywood is telling you with predictive programming like I Am Legend.
[00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.007]  My name is Robert Neville.
[00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.611]  I'm a survivor living in New York City.
[00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:24.595]  I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.
[00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:32.056]  I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday, when the sun is highest in the sky.
[00:13:34.197 --> 00:13:44.980]  If you are out there, if anyone is out there, I can provide food, I can provide shelter, I can provide security.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.826]   If there's anybody out there, anybody, Please.
[00:13:54.707 --> 00:13:56.707]  You are not alone.
