[00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:13.033]  The entire global corporate establishment is unified, ganging up on individuals across the world from aboriginal populations to poor Americans right here in the US.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:25.657]  And now Noam Chomsky has jumped on the establishment bandwagon and is calling for those that do not take these dangerous experimental shots to be locked in their homes and more.
[00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:35.877]   If people decide I am willing to be a danger to the community by refusing a vaccine.
[00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:42.065]  They should then say, well, I also have the decency to isolate myself.
[00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:53.535]  When you talk about folks having the freedom to separate if they don't want to abide by these vaccine mandates, how do you think this would practically play out?
[00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:58.118]  They should have the decency to remove themselves from the community.
[00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:05.664]  If they refuse to do that, then measures have to be taken to safeguard the community from them.
[00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:11.929]  Then comes the practical question that you ask, how can we get food to them?
[00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.369]  Well, that's actually their problem.
[00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.369]  [Music]
[00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.369]   Noam Chomsky is making the rounds on internet talk shows and saying the big enemy of America and the world
[00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.369]   is people that don't take the experimental shots from Pfizer and Moderna.
[00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.951]  Gee, that's interesting.
[00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:39.893]  Doesn't he know that a bunch of countries have actually banned the use in under-16s because of microcarditis and heart attacks?
[00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:44.435]  Doesn't he know that it's not even classed as a standard old-fashioned vaccine?
[00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:58.368]  Or does he care that it's come out that Fauci and the military industrial complex that he rails against so much cooked up this virus and a bunch of other even more deadly viruses at the Wuhan lab with gain of function and then lied to Congress and the world?
[00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:03.328]   Does he know about Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation 11 years ago saying
[00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:06.887]   they'd use a cooked up virus from China to take the world over?
[00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:10.546]   Does he know that Fauci talked about how they'd destroy the current medical system and bring
[00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:16.146]   in a new system that bypasses checks and balances and FDA approval using the fear of a Chinese
[00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:18.527]  virus in 2019?
[00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:23.167]   No, he doesn't know any of that or he doesn't want to know that.
[00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.878]  So let's just move that to the side and look at what he's saying.
[00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:36.282]  Like we're in Nazi Germany, people that don't take not just these new shots but whatever new shots they want via these vaccine passports need to be locked up in their homes.
[00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:39.103]  And then another host asked him, well how do we feed them?
[00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:40.964]  He says, I really don't care.
[00:02:41.564 --> 00:02:59.080]   So we're now talking about house arrest We're not talking about basically turning your house into a gulag or a ghetto and we're talking about using that to hold people hostage until they acquiesce to Pfizer that's bought off all the major regulatory agencies and you've got a revolving door.
[00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:08.183]  With not just the heads of these agencies being in Pfizer and Moderna, but also even the head of Reuters being on the board of Pfizer.
[00:03:08.963 --> 00:03:21.866]  I mean, this is corporate fascism worldwide, with the communist Chinese working with the Wuhan lab and Fauci and Peter Daszak and Bill Gates to bring us this virus that's totally destabilized civilization.
[00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:29.308]  And you've got Bond villain Klaus Schwab up there saying that they're using it to bring in the Great Reset to bankrupt the capitalist society.
[00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:32.568]  and bring in a new socialist utopia. The Great Reset.
[00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:35.237]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it.
[00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:38.807]   The truth is it's the ultra-rich that are financing communism and socialism
[00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:42.528]   because they're above it. They fly above it with their fascist system while they cut off
[00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:47.167]   our resources. When Obama, seven years ago, went to Africa and said you can't have
[00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.487]   cars or air conditioning or the earth will burn up, well he sure flies around on
[00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:56.167]   private jets and has cars and bought a big huge estate right on the ocean at one foot above sea level
[00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.487]  because he knows it's all a fraud.
[00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:00.607]  It's a power grab and it's a scam.
[00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:13.144]  People like Noam Chomsky have always been creatures of academia, creatures of the big banks, creatures of academic funding that almost 100% comes from the big tax-free foundations.
[00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:32.946]   But he illustrates the fact that the system is making its move on us, the powerful corporations, the powerful big pharma, the powerful banks, the powerful media and big tech, and people like Fauci and other little garden gnomes like Chomsky all teamed up claiming that it's
[00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:36.187]   those of us that don't just roll our sleeves up and take these toxic
[00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:40.687]   brews, these frankenshots of the problem when they are the ones that are the problem.
[00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:43.187]  They've declared war on humanity.
[00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:46.586]  They've declared war on once free republics like America.
[00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:50.687]   While they love open borders with the collapsed refugee populations
[00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:56.997]   they're flooding us with caused not by COVID-19, but the global lockdowns that have destroyed supply chains
[00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:04.387]   and already starved over 25 million extra people to death in the last 20 months of this COVID nonsense.
[00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:11.454]   So people like Fauci, like Daszak, like Gates, and like Noam Chomsky that have supported worldwide lockdowns have blood on your hands.
[00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:20.038]  So you're not just like a Nazi when you want to put us on house arrest and in these urban ghettos because we won't take into our bodies what you want to rape us with.
[00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:29.502]  You are also Hitlerian in that you support this entire global authoritarian system and these lockdowns that are depopulating the third world.
[00:05:29.822 --> 00:05:30.703]  You're a monster.
[00:05:30.903 --> 00:05:37.166]  You're part of the establishment, but you're emblematic of a dying globalist establishment hanging on by its fingernails.
[00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:44.649]  And you will be buried along with all those false identities when America and the rest of the free world defeats you, Noam Chomsky.
[00:05:45.469 --> 00:06:08.795]   People who refuse to accept vaccines, I think the right response for them is not to force them to, but rather to insist that they be isolated if people decide I am willing to be a danger to the community by refusing a vaccine.
[00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:15.021]  They should then say, well, I also have the decency to isolate myself.
[00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:16.562]  Okay?
[00:06:17.162 --> 00:06:21.286]  I don't want a vaccine, but I don't have the right to run around harming people.
[00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:25.510]  That should be a convention.
[00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:34.727]   When you talk about folks having the freedom to separate if they don't want to abide by these vaccine mandates,
[00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.387]  how do you think this would practically play out?
[00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:43.567]   Same way as with people who say, "I don't want to accept traffic rules."
[00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:49.766]   I suppose there were people who said, "It's an attack on my liberty to make me stop at a red light."
[00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:51.174]  It's government overreach.
[00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:55.036]  We don't want the state to have that power over my private life.
[00:06:55.656 --> 00:06:58.198]  Well, such people have to be.
[00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:04.106]  They should have the decency to remove themselves from the community.
[00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:11.634]  If they refuse to do that, then measures have to be taken to safeguard the community from them.
[00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:17.921]  Then comes the practical question that you ask, how can we get food to them?
[00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.223]  Well, that's actually their problem.
[00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:34.250]  Of course, if they really become destitute, then yes, you have to move in with some measure to secure their survival, just as you do with people in jail, for example.
[00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.833]  Chomsky is manufacturing consent, something he's an expert on.
[00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:48.919]  He's pretending to be anti-establishment, but he is lockstep with Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and others to create a global social credit score and to punish those that don't submit.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:08:07.470]   That's why the inventor of the so-called global social credit score, a communist Chinese operative, has come out openly and said, Tie everyone's housing to government control, and if they protest the government, or they protest vaccines, or they protest anything, simply throw them out on the street.
[00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:14.173]  This isn't some loving, egalitarian, leftist system that wants to give us everything for free with a universal income because they love us.
[00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:17.534]  This is being done because they want full and total control.
[00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:25.178]  And the powerful billionaires of the planet are the ones that are almost 100% behind setting up this system because they are exempt from it.
[00:08:25.854 --> 00:08:30.878]  I think we have put in place a good technological method.
[00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:35.201]  And I really hope that we will be able to export it to a capitalist country.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   I think France should adopt our social credit system to regulate its social movements.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:53.071]   If you had the social credit system, We would have detected that before they acted.
[00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:55.872]  We could have predicted it, there would not have been these events.
[00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:59.751]  If we could have known this, we could have planned it.
[00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:02.751]  There would not have been this event.
[00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:07.751]  It is one of the advantages of social credit.
[00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:11.751]   Whether it's Hillary Clinton or whether it's the Prime Minister of New Zealand
[00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:14.751]  or whether it's Noam Chomsky, the mask has come off.
[00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:21.710]  And they're telling you, yes, if you don't take in your body whatever we want, whenever we want, we're going to make you second-class citizens.
[00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.355]  But even those that submit and take all the shots are told, sorry, they don't work, there's even more shots coming.
[00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:31.759]  And then there's what these shots do, blood clots, and they erase your immune system.
[00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.805]  Yes, the left is trying to literally kill us.
[00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:39.405]   And Noam Chomsky knows that, and he's always been part of this, because he's a statist
[00:09:39.405 --> 00:09:47.804]  elitist.
[00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:48.708]  They've already war-gamed it all out.
[00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:54.047]   unvaccinated you have all these rights if you are vaccinated that is what it is so yep yep.
[00:09:54.047 --> 00:10:00.206]   In conclusion this is a united nations corporate operation they've already war
[00:10:00.206 --> 00:10:04.527]   gamed it all out they've already admitted to their plans once the so-called vaccines don't work
[00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:10.287]   and make people sick they blame the unvaccinated for the new giant outbreaks
[00:10:10.489 --> 00:10:15.953]  Then they start housing people in camps because they won't take the shots.
[00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:17.114]  And that's where this is all leading.
[00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:19.335]  Oh, we can't just leave people in their homes.
[00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:20.936]  They can't pay their bills anymore.
[00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:21.697]  They don't have food.
[00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.458]  So you're going to be re-educated.
[00:10:23.478 --> 00:10:28.281]  You're going to be taken for, quote, counseling at one of these living facilities.
[00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.804]  And that's now even what the head of the CDC announced that she wants today.
[00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:42.472]  How tough do you think it is going to be to convince parents, once you go through all of these approvals, that it's safe to get a 5- to 11-year-old, give them a vaccine?
[00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:49.518]  And should, at that point, should schools mandate that kids of this age get the vaccine as they do lots of other vaccines?
[00:10:51.061 --> 00:11:02.108]  Right, so we have, I'm really excited and enthusiastic about reviewing this science and I'm really hopeful that in that proper review we will get to a place where we have a vaccine for 5 to 11 year olds.
[00:11:02.488 --> 00:11:12.935]  When and if we do, we have a lot of parents, as you noted, a third who are ready to get their children vaccinated right away and we know we have a lot of work ahead of us just as we did with the initial vaccine.
[00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:18.897]  These numbers are exactly the same as they were early, late December last year when the initial vaccine rolled out.
[00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:23.339]  And yet today we have over nearly 80% of people who received their first dose.
[00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:33.623]  So we have to do all of that hard work again, education, communication, so that we can get parents comfortable with getting their children vaccinated where so many parents are already.
[00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:39.809]  This is a worldwide program from the UK to Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:47.937]  This is the authoritarian takeover with the fascist corporations merging with the communist leftists around the world.
[00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:49.779]  This is their main assault.
[00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:51.421]  This is the Great Reset.
[00:11:52.495 --> 00:12:00.978]  Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday, October 22nd, 2021, with a very important update for supporters of InfoWars.
