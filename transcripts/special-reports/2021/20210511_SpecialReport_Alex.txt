[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:18.562]  Peter Daszak, the British director of six projects at the Wuhan Lab, directly funded by Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci, has confessed on video to weaponizing five viruses in China and combining them into COVID-19.
[00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:20.824]  We're about to lay it out right now.
[00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:31.750]  For five years, from 2014 to 2019, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Tony Fauci runs and has for decades, pumped money to a group called the EcoHealth Alliance.
[00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.614]  The EcoHealth Alliance is run by a man whose name you may recognize, Dr. Peter Daszak.
[00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:42.199]  Daszak contracted with Dr. Xi to conduct gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan lab.
[00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.524]  Daszak bragged about how easy it is to manipulate coronaviruses in lab experiments.
[00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:50.839]  You can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily.
[00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.621]  Spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus.
[00:00:55.222 --> 00:01:01.786]  The gain-of-function research that Peter Daszak was bragging about in the video we just showed you had in fact been banned explicitly by the U.S.
[00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:02.146]  government.
[00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:10.372]  There was a federal moratorium on the funding of exactly the kind of gain-of-function experiments that went on in the Wuhan lab to disastrous effects.
[00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:12.853]  So why didn't the U.S.
[00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.776]  government halt its funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:18.585]  Who signed off on this?
[00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:31.331]  Tony Fauci, possibly along with Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, invoked that special exemption in order to keep funding the Wuhan lab and the deadly experiments that were going on there.
[00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:34.313]  The experiments that clearly went so wrong.
[00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.655]  This wouldn't have happened if Tony Fauci didn't allow it to happen.
[00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:41.636]  That is clear.
[00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:44.257]  It's an amazing story.
[00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:45.558]  It is a shocking story.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:56.128]  In a functional country, there would be a criminal investigation currently underway into Tony Fauci's role in the COVID pandemic that has killed millions and halted our country and changed it forever.
[00:01:56.668 --> 00:02:00.828]   So why isn't there a criminal investigation into Tony Fauci's role in this pandemic?
[00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:06.427]  [MUSIC]
[00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:12.508]   This is undoubtedly the biggest news we've ever broken in my 27 year history on air.
[00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:18.009]   Now, Tucker Carlson, Partially scooped us last night, which I am totally happy to do.
[00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.549]  I was up here at like 6.30.
[00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.172]  I was exhausted last night and I told Rob Dew, let's do this in the morning.
[00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:25.772]  This story is so important.
[00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:30.634]  Let's let, let's come in and shoot a special report and then add all the documentation to this because it's so giant.
[00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:35.477]  And then I went home, turned on Tucker Carlson, my family, and watched him tell about 80% of the story.
[00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:50.110]  That he pointed to a major report from a former top New York Times writer, Nicholas Wade, that is in the wire.in, because the New York Times obviously would not publish something this huge.
[00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.252]  And what does he break down from all the admitted evidence that we're about to lay out?
[00:02:54.872 --> 00:03:03.717]  The Wuhan lab was a joint operation between the Obama administration and the Communist Chinese with Dr. Fauci running the operation.
[00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:05.958]  And that's what all the documents and all the admissions are.
[00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:21.370]  And then, when it began to come out last year, they had the people that actually ran these projects at the lab write the Landsat study saying that there was no connection to the lab and putting out the fake information about the wet animal market.
[00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.935]  And so, you've got them funding it, you've got them running it, you've got them trying to cover it up, but here's what's even more insane.
[00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:36.094]   Tucker only got to part of the interview with the main corporate manager of six of the gain-of-function
[00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:40.375]  weaponization of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
[00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:49.615]   In the full interview he did in 2019, he actually admits that they were working on creating
[00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:56.455]   a super virus with all five viruses in it and how to infect humans so they could then
[00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:59.895]  and create a vaccine for the threat.
[00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:05.475]  That's how bioweapon development works is you get around international treaties and national laws by saying, oh, no, we're not creating a bioweapon.
[00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:10.259]  We're creating horrible things in a lab that someone else might make so we can counter it.
[00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.721]  But nature would have never combined five viruses together.
[00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:16.363]  And CRISPR gene editing is dead on.
[00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:38.044]  The Indians own them, Europe owns them, the US, China, Australia, and it was 14, 15 months ago that the major Indian institute, very respected, scanned the virus and said, it's five viruses, it has HIV delivery system, you can see the P shuttle gene insertions where they spliced the viruses together.
[00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.320]  And so it was 100% Frankenstein.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.741]  The discoverer of HIV, top virologist, he came out and said, I've looked at the scans.
[00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:47.261]  It's made in a lab.
[00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:50.422]  It's like you look at the space shuttle and you say, humans made that.
[00:04:50.442 --> 00:04:54.324]  Or you look at a skyscraper, that's artificial, compared to a blue whale.
[00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.764]  You know artificial when you see it.
[00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.505]  The science is 100%.
[00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.346]  So you've got Fauci and Bill Gates and Obama.
[00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:07.105]   when a lot of scientists in the US complained about this at North Carolina Chapel Hill in
[00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:14.185]   2015 saying that this is really dangerous, this is bioweapon development at these laboratories
[00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:16.725]  that don't have very high security, this is illegal.
[00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:22.225]   So they moved it to China and of course the Chinese military was involved as well.
[00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:23.665]  But that's only part of the story.
[00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:27.625]   So I'm going to lay it out for you right now and as Paul Harvey would say, give you the
[00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:31.346]   rest of the story of what Tucker Carlson is now talking about.
[00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:34.905]   And again obviously with Dr. Francis Boyle that wrote the US biological weapons law and
[00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:38.346]  other experts over a year ago, we already laid this out.
[00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:40.346]  The point is that now we've got...
[00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.395]  Not a distant view of what happened, but a very close, detailed one, and all the pieces have come together.
[00:05:46.676 --> 00:06:01.730]  And it turns out the very individuals involved in this, as usual, were bragging about it before they decide to allow it to leak from the lab as an economic weapon to shut down the U.S., to win the trade war for communist China, and to throw President Trump out of office.
[00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.931]  So let's go through the evidence.
[00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:29.488]   Wuhan scientists took The North Carolina SARS with Gain of Function, which is already a biological warfare weapon, and they took the technology here behind this well-developed SARS-HIV weapon, and they all brought it back to the Wuhan BSL-4
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:48.348]  And tried to DNA genetically engineer it into a chimera, into a biological warfare weapon involving the coronavirus, the HIV virus, and gain-of-function.
[00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:57.792]  Gain-of-function work can only be done safely in a BSL-4 or a BSL-3 facility.
[00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:15.021]  So I think clearly this is the smoking gun and there is no legitimate scientific or medical use for gain-of-function technology, DNA technology on biowarfare.
[00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.963]  So there's no excuse that it's a vaccine test that got out?
[00:07:18.793 --> 00:07:19.593]  That's blurry.
[00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:25.992]   Enter Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance, that again, publicly was funded by
[00:07:25.992 --> 00:07:34.471]   the NIH in six major projects at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. That upset scientists in the U.S.
[00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:47.497]  They say it's violating the law, so Obama makes a deal with Wuhan, and they move it the next year to Wuhan, and the funding is public and moves over, and Anthony Fauci specifically signs off on it.
[00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:49.159]  Tucker Carlson covered that last night.
[00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:57.645]  His name is on the documents, on the signatures, to allow the development of weaponized, gain-of-function bioweapons.
[00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:05.648]   Only way you can do it is if the head of one of the two infectious disease agencies and Fauci headed up one of them, authorized it.
[00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:14.767]   Peter Dazik got $3,700,000 plus from the NIH, from Fauci, and from Bill Gates' sub-directorates
[00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:22.887]   to then begin to weaponize five different viruses that they harvested out of the wilds
[00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:26.687]   of China and other parts of the world to then fuse them into one.
[00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:30.957]  And incredibly, in an interview in December of 2019, he admitted it.
[00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:31.558]  Here's the video.
[00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:35.632]  Then we started looking, where do they come from?
[00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:51.879]  And we went out to southern China and did surveillance of bats across southern China and we've now found, after six or seven years of doing this, over a hundred new SARS-related coronaviruses, very close to SARS.
[00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:53.840]  Some of them get into human cells.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.800]  In the lab.
[00:08:56.201 --> 00:09:07.565]  Some of them can cause SARS disease in humanized mice models, and are untreatable with therapeutic monoclonals, and you can't vaccinate against them with the vaccine.
[00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:09.966]  So these are a clear and present danger.
[00:09:10.546 --> 00:09:16.768]  We've even found people with antibodies in Yunnan to SARS-related coronaviruses, so there's human exposure.
[00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:17.168]  Right.
[00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:29.954]  Surveillance, we're just beginning another five years of work to look at cohorts in southern China to say, well, how frequent does this spillover happen and is it associated with disease?
[00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:39.979]  Because I expect, just like Nipah in Bangladesh, there are dozens and dozens of small spillovers going on on the planet any one time, which we just never see.
[00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:40.299]  Sure.
[00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:41.940]  Yeah, they never amplify.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.006]  There are a few cases and they're just absorbed in the illness, the overall illness of the population, right?
[00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:48.628]  No, you could say, so who cares?
[00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:53.473]  You know, and that's one argument, but our strategy is any one of those could become pandemic.
[00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.836]  There's a lot of stochasticity in what happens then.
[00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:56.296]  Yeah.
[00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:02.363]  So if we look at all of them, understand patterns, try and reduce the number of spillover events we've got, you know.
[00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:11.569]  But if you're saying these are diverse coronaviruses and you can't vaccinate against them, they're no antivirals, what do we do?
[00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:14.591]  Well, I think that coronaviruses are pretty good.
[00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:19.894]  I mean, you're a virologist, you know all this stuff, but you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily.
[00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:25.258]  It's just spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus, zoonotic risk.
[00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:34.023]   So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein, and we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert it into the backbone of another Yeah, sure.
[00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.342]  and do some work in the lab.
[00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:39.742]  So you can get more predictive when you find a sequence.
[00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:41.423]  You've got this diversity.
[00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:48.521]   Now, the logical progression for vaccines is if you're gonna develop a vaccine for SARS,
[00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:55.221]   people are gonna use pandemic SARS as their, but let's try and insert some of these other related
[00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.423]  and get a better vaccine.
[00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.742]  And I guess also knowledge of what's there.
[00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:02.783]   If you see something emerging, it'd give it a head start on making a vaccine
[00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:12.143]  That's true, and you know, better knowledge of where they are as well, so you can put your money into these clinics that matter.
[00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:27.236]  You just saw Peter Daszak, over a year and a half ago, brag to a reporter about how they were manipulating spike proteins to be able to infect humans easier, and how they were going to fuse all these viruses together so they'd have one vaccine.
[00:11:27.964 --> 00:11:37.986]  That is exactly what Dr. Francis Boyle said 15 months ago on my broadcast, that they were developing the bioweapon so they could then create the cure for it.
[00:11:38.607 --> 00:11:39.747]  But what's even better than that?
[00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:55.851]  Release it yourself, take over the world, have the Great Reset, tell billions of people they're not essential, and consolidate power so big tech and big banks double and triple their profits, and Communist China, open for business, wins the global trade war.
[00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:00.132]  This is 21st Century Warfare, and it's hiding in plain view.
[00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:10.734]  Starting in 2015, the world-renowned top expert on coronaviruses and gain-of-function, Ralph S. Baric, teams up with the famous Bat Lady.
[00:12:11.074 --> 00:12:13.714]  Now listen to this from their own admissions.
[00:12:13.814 --> 00:12:23.616]  Their work focused on enhancing the ability of bat viruses to attack humans so as to examine the emergence potential that is the potential to infect humans.
[00:12:24.448 --> 00:12:26.469]  But then it gets worse in part two of our report.
[00:12:27.229 --> 00:12:45.897]  Fauci had already done studies at the Level 4 Bioweapons Lab, University of Texas at Galveston in 2012, studying three different coronavirus vaccines that attack a similar protein, and they found that it caused mass death, ladies and gentlemen, in the lab animals that were given it.
[00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:51.979]  Blood clots, Alzheimer's-type diseases, and of course, heart attacks and the lungs shutting down.
[00:12:52.239 --> 00:13:08.852]  What's so horrifying about this is you notice in video after video, interview after interview, these scientists from Bill Gates right down to the program manager at Wuhan are laughing and giggling and smirking and just saying they're having the best time of their life.
[00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:20.962]   And when Bill Gates is on national TV talking about the economy never coming back and the shutdown never ending or terrorists are going to release a more deadly bioweapon soon, he's just so incredibly happy Are you having fun, by the way?
[00:13:20.982 --> 00:13:21.263]  I love it.
[00:13:21.283 --> 00:13:22.144]  Yeah, I love this work.
[00:13:22.184 --> 00:13:25.188]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:13:25.027 --> 00:13:47.226]  while consolidating power and unlimited wealth to himself.
[00:13:47.257 --> 00:14:06.805]  Now the good news is, I'm not trying to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism.
[00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:09.951]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:14:10.011 --> 00:14:12.574]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:16.580]  People are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:20.596]  It's critical to understand that Peter Daszak has been caught red-handed.
[00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:34.206]  Reporters have gotten the emails shared by his organization where they said, we can't let the public know that we are the ones writing the Lancet study saying that there's no evidence of anything happening at the Wuhan lab.
[00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:36.228]  But all of that has now come out.
[00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:50.979]   And so again, you have the motive, you have the history, you have them admitting it, you have them then covering it up, and you have them Continuing to cover it up with the corporate media trying to back him, but nothing can stop a story this big from coming out.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:15:03.549]  Especially when the man managing the whole thing worldwide, through the United Nations, Anthony Fauci, actually owns many of the patents for the vaccines and is becoming even more wealthy as we speak.
[00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:09.594]  Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:28.131]  Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:28.952]  Do they fund Dr. Barak?
[00:15:29.884 --> 00:15:33.867]  We do not fund... Do you fund Dr. Barrett's gain-of-function research?
[00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:44.494]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain-of-function research, and if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina, not in China.
[00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:51.178]  You don't think inserting a bat virus spike protein that he got from the Wuhan Institute into the SARS virus is gain-of-function?
[00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:59.584]  That is not... You are not a minority because at least 200 scientists have signed a statement from the Cambridge Working Group saying that it is gain-of-function.
[00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:00.924]  Well, it is not.
[00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:10.507]  And if you look at the grant, and you look at the progress reports, it has not gained a function, despite the fact that people tweet that.
[00:16:10.907 --> 00:16:14.529]  So do you still support sending money to the Wuhan Virology Institute?
[00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:17.569]  We do not send money now to the Wuhan Virology Institute.
[00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:18.890]  Do you support sending money?
[00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.470]  We did, under your tutelage.
[00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.311]  We were sending it through EcoHealth.
[00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:24.692]  It was a sub-agency and a sub-grant.
[00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:28.953]  Do you support the money from NIH that was going to the Wuhan Institute?
[00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:32.541]  Let me explain to you why that was done.
[00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:36.009]  Going out into nature and harvesting the wild viruses.
[00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:37.873]  Splicing them together.
[00:16:39.076 --> 00:16:45.521]  Then releasing them, creating a worldwide shutdown, posing as the savior, was only one half of the equation.
[00:16:46.222 --> 00:16:47.423]  Now you see the rest of the equation.
[00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:54.529]  Bullying the world population into taking experimental mRNA vaccines that change our very DNA.
[00:16:54.849 --> 00:17:09.660]   And up until a year and a half ago, all the scientists involved in inventing this and preparing this and rolling this out Told the world that they were going to go in and, quote, fix our DNA and, quote, change the code in our bodies through these new super high-tech vaccines.
[00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:14.264]  And that's where Tal Zaks, Chief Medical Officer of Moderna Inc., comes in.
[00:17:14.584 --> 00:17:21.389]  He confirms in an interview that mRNA injections for COVID-19 can change your genetic code or DNA in a 2017 TED Talk.
[00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:22.009]  It's all in your face.
[00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:32.528]  As I've trained as a physician scientist, we've been living this phenomenal digital and scientific revolution.
[00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:42.452]  And I'm here today to tell you that we're actually hacking the software of life, and that it's changing the way we think about prevention and treatment of disease.
[00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:46.394]  So here's all the biology you need to know in 30 seconds.
[00:17:48.315 --> 00:17:49.815]  Our body is made out of organs.
[00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:52.377]  Our organs are made out of cells.
[00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:06.178]  And in every cell, there's this thing called messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, that transmits the critical information from the DNA, our genes, to the protein, which is really the stuff we're all made out of.
[00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:11.121]  This is the critical information that determines what a cell will actually do.
[00:18:12.242 --> 00:18:14.003]  And so we think of it like an operating system.
[00:18:15.444 --> 00:18:21.608]  And it's not just in every cell of our body, it's actually in every cell of every organism alive.
[00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:22.569]  It's the same thing.
[00:18:23.846 --> 00:18:41.671]  And so, if you could actually change that, which we call the software of life, if you could introduce a line of code, or change a line of code, it turns out that has profound implications for everything from the flu to cancer.
[00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:47.290]   Keep in mind that when you watch this historic report, we have links to prestigious researchers
[00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.490]   and scientists that lay out these facts in a very easy to understand way.
[00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.211]   And it's even more important that you understand that this is a medical takeover.
[00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:02.769]   This is a revolution by the mad scientists, genetic engineers that want to set the policy
[00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:09.371]   to mass test unproven genetic therapies on the world, turning all of us into guinea pigs.
[00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:14.810]   And that as we speak across the world, the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory
[00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:23.851]   organizations are authorizing emergency use of Moderna mRNA vaccines on young people ages
[00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:24.770]  12 to 15.
[00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:29.148]  And they're saying by next month, they're going to start targeting newborns and toddlers.
[00:19:29.808 --> 00:19:32.009]  That's why this is so incredibly important.
[00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:38.850]  Again, in the links below and at InfoWars.com, you will find these two key reports reposted.
[00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:47.892]  Bulletin of Atomic Scientist Opens the Wuhan Virus Pandora's Box, a lengthy report from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:19:48.272 --> 00:19:59.254]  Another excellent report by former top New York Times science writer who had to go to the wire to be able to publish this key report that also breaks down what you've just seen and more.
[00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:01.095]  Origins of COVID-19.
[00:20:01.515 --> 00:20:03.355]  Who opened Pandora's box at Wuhan?
[00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:05.476]  People or nature?
[00:20:05.776 --> 00:20:07.397]  And of course, the rest of the story.
[00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:09.297]  None of this was done by accident.
[00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:10.778]  They did this for global domination.
[00:20:11.218 --> 00:20:16.940]  They did it in China so that the globalist ally with China could release the bioweapon on humanity itself.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.502]  And it would be a tool for the Chinese Communist model to take over the planet.
[00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:23.356]  That's why they've done this.
[00:20:23.716 --> 00:20:26.237]  They've increased their wealth, their power, their control.
[00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:27.598]  They've silenced their critics.
[00:20:27.898 --> 00:20:29.139]  They've brought in medical tyranny.
[00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:30.800]  They've expanded censorship.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.641]  And they are behind this attack.
[00:20:33.021 --> 00:20:44.948]  A consortium of the globalists, through the UN, with the communist Chinese, Xi Jinping, managed by Anthony Fauci, and funded through private foundations by Bill and Melinda Gates and others.
[00:20:45.268 --> 00:20:47.550]  I want you to understand this is deadly serious.
[00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:51.315]  The globalists have just launched their attack.
[00:20:51.935 --> 00:20:55.237]  Everything you've seen, the millions dead, is just the beginning.
[00:20:56.218 --> 00:21:06.084]  Everyone must discover this information, share this information, and we must see the criminals that carried out this mega-maniacal power grab brought to justice.
[00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:12.489]  If they're not brought to justice, they will continue to expand this assault on humanity.
[00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:17.831]  This is biological warfare in the 21st century carried out by an axis of evil.
[00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:27.475]  Communist China, Fortune 100 corporations with big tech and big banks at its heart with a scientific establishment involved in a giant power grab.
[00:21:28.095 --> 00:21:28.875]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:30.736]  We're all in this together.
[00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:32.537]  Now it's time to take action.
[00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:40.180]  An Australian biotech company has developed a new treatment it hopes will prevent people dying from COVID vaccine.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.900]  dying from COVID vaccine.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.259]  Dying from COVID vaccine.
[00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:51.900]   It's worrying health officials who call mass vaccinations the only path to a return to normalcy.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.700]   Almost four months into the vaccination effort, providers are beginning to run out of people
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.340]  who want to be euthanized.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.939]  But we're almost through all of 1A.
[00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:02.957]  It's now 1B.
[00:22:03.577 --> 00:22:06.339]  1B are our most critical people.
[00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:10.881]  So they are our older people, 70 years of age and older.
[00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:16.184]  We know they are just so vulnerable to getting ill and dying from this vaccine.
[00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.486]  How do you feel right now, Maestra?
[00:22:20.626 --> 00:22:27.629]  Excited, with a great joy for this new opportunity of life at the show.
[00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:32.571]  Because it was a very big experience, very sad.
[00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:33.531]  Oh my God!
[00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:42.194]  Is it conventional, Maestra?
[00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:43.555]  Let's see.
[00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:46.753]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:46.753 --> 00:22:49.795]  [MUSIC]
[00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:51.153]  [FOREIGN]
[00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:53.464]  Oh, yesterday afternoon.
[00:22:53.504 --> 00:22:58.349]  Yesterday afternoon.
[00:22:58.369 --> 00:23:06.978]  We have to lower the stretcher.
[00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:10.461]  After this COVID.
[00:23:10.502 --> 00:23:11.042]  The vaccine.
[00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:19.092]  The whole chronology of where we are is based on lies, you know?
[00:23:19.593 --> 00:23:32.369]  That coronavirus is lethal, that there was no prevention and treatment, that it's an emergency that requires social distancing en masse, which it doesn't, and that the solution was an mRNA vaccine that was safe and effective, which it isn't.
[00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:39.741]  And that it's causing huge harm and we know as well that the more harm from these mRNA vaccines will happen in the years to come.
[00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:46.111]  So my, you know what I've been saying all along is anyone who's over 70 who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably be...
[00:23:46.934 --> 00:24:06.890]  Sadly die within about two to three years and I would say anyone who gets the mRNA injection no matter what age you are your life expectancy will be reduced to you know dying if you're in your 30s within five to ten years and you probably will have allergy, neurocognitive issues, inflammation and of course infertility is the major one.
[00:24:07.355 --> 00:24:14.579]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
