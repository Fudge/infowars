[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.851]  It is Tuesday, January 23rd.
[00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.132]  The year is 2021.
[00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:07.373]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:19.699]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to play another extremely important, informative, and powerful piece from Tucker Carlson tonight with Naomi Wolf, a true classical liberal.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.962]  And just a decade ago, she was the cat's meow in the liberal establishment.
[00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:35.922]  But today she warns that Biden is becoming a dictator, that they're setting up a high tech police state and that everyone on the entire political spectrum should be concerned.
[00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:48.027]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are two minutes to midnight and I'm glad Tucker did this, but he praises her for having courage to do this and talks about how rare it is, but that's incredibly sad.
[00:00:49.107 --> 00:01:03.159]   The fact that you do have Some of the more famous real liberal academics and others, not just her, coming out and saying we're in deep trouble is not enough.
[00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.100]  We need a lot more people to come out.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.402]  When George W. Bush was going out to the left and violate the Constitution Bill of Rights, I opposed him.
[00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:14.483]  And so did constitutional lawyer Jonathan Turley.
[00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:18.565]  Well, Turley has also been speaking out.
[00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:20.863]  against what's happening.
[00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:27.467]  And now they're shifting the entire apparatus that we always warned was being used on Muslims, but would be used on everybody.
[00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:30.509]  And they are setting up domestic checkpoints.
[00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.751]  They're setting up the surveillance systems.
[00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:40.235]  And now they're saying, oh, and you're going to have a vaccine every time you travel and you're going to have this travel passport.
[00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:44.478]  I told you all this a year ago because it's in operation lockstep.
[00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:46.399]  It's part of the Great Reset.
[00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.659]   And Klaus Schwab is on record saying, Now in the great reset, we do not change the environment.
[00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.360]  We change you inside your DNA.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.581]  So it is a corporate takeover of our DNA.
[00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:15.159]   And that's what's so incredible is we have Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook coming out and saying in a leaked video that, Oh, We shouldn't take this mRNA vaccine.
[00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:16.800]  It's been untested.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.760]  They skipped animal trials.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.941]  It's not really a vaccine.
[00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:19.901]  It's a medical device.
[00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.243]  Well, when I say that, I'm banned on Facebook.
[00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:34.864]   When he says it and it gets leaked, the media doesn't say a word about it because this is The establishment, I can assure you, is not taking these vaccines.
[00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:50.155]  By the way, another big group of articles all over the news last night and this morning, that Mark Zuckerberg is so evil and so bad, why he defended Alex Jones, and he secretly tried to protect Alex Jones.
[00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:54.438]  Well, why would he protect somebody that's been coming after him all these years?
[00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:55.678]  The truth is, he didn't protect me.
[00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:03.732]  They put out a policy directive about a year and a half ago, whenever I said that Joe Biden had dementia.
[00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:04.313]  Remember that?
[00:03:05.354 --> 00:03:11.940]  And they said that you cannot say something positive about Alex Jones, only disparaging.
[00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:16.391]   And they listed us as Dangerous persons.
[00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:18.592]  Okay, that means like Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:28.216]  And did any of you remember they listed myself, Paul Watson of all people, Laura Loomer, and a whole bunch of other people that have no history of being offensively violent.
[00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:31.077]  And I mean, Paul is not even really an activist.
[00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:33.618]  He just does stuff from his computer and shoots great videos.
[00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.021]  And they said in there that it was okay for people to call for violence against us.
[00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:40.421]  Remember that?
[00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:46.508]   And so now we know it was Zuckerberg came in And change that and said, you can't call for violence against people.
[00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:48.090]  That's what his board said.
[00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.633]  And you can let people say positive things about people.
[00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:56.998]  Not because he's a good guy, but that's further down the authoritarian system, the Overton window.
[00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.520]  They have to get us there first.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.482]  We are not allowed to praise someone.
[00:04:03.422 --> 00:04:04.343]  They have to get you there first.
[00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:07.707]  They just can't, oh, by the way, you know, we're not censoring anybody.
[00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:13.793]  They testify to Congress and then they ban Alex Jones as a test case and then say, oh, you can't say positive things about Alex Jones.
[00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:13.853]  So.
[00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:18.626]  That's why Zuckerberg's doing this, because it's just too much.
[00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:20.608]  Now, a few years later, look what he's doing.
[00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:24.490]  Just last week, banned all news sharing on Facebook Australia.
[00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:29.174]  All news, including government reports, because the government was criticizing Facebook and said to pass a law.
[00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:33.657]  So that's how big they've gotten for their britches, that they censor presidents.
[00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:37.602]  They censor entire governments, they censor entire systems, because we put up with it.
[00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:39.504]  It is a corporate power grab.
[00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:42.087]  We'll be right back with the Tucker Carlson, Naomi Wolf piece.
[00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:43.188]  Please spread the word.
[00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:44.610]  It's the only way we override the censors.
[00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.951]  Spread the word, my friends.
[00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.552]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:51.912]   Share the links from Band.Video, InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com if you want to override the
[00:04:51.912 --> 00:05:01.832]  New World Order, which I know you do.
[00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:05.231]  Here are some of the headlines at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.059]  There's video of this.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:23.735]  Merrick Garland, the guy they're set to confirm as the new Attorney General, the Obama frontman, says Antifa attacks on courthouses aren't domestic terrorism because they happen at night, even as they set the buildings on fire with police, federal police inside, and attack them with hatchets and hammers.
[00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.059]  That's right.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:39.451]  ADL data shows 2020 had lowest number of domestic extremist related killings in over a decade, but record numbers of whites being killed, of course, in racial attacks, but they don't track that, but those are the numbers from the FBI.
[00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.453]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:58.305]  Of course, we have the big news, and that is that they are talking about permanent troops in D.C., domestic internal checkpoints, domestic travel passports, even get on a bus or a train, much less a plane.
[00:05:58.365 --> 00:06:02.889]  And it's all officially being announced out of Bill Gates's mouth.
[00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:14.373]   So the first thing I want to get to here today is really an astoundingly important interview that Tucker Carlson did last night with Naomi Wolf.
[00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:25.616]  She's a best-selling author, and I would call her on the liberal spectrum of things a decent person that actually cares about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:06:25.776 --> 00:06:35.358]  And she came out and said that they were setting up domestic checkpoints, that Biden's becoming a dictator, this is a dictatorship, and that she wouldn't have voted for him if she knew that he was going to do this.
[00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:38.869]  Well, I mean, what do you think the left's been setting up all over the world?
[00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.109]  What do you think the left does?
[00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.031]  Liberalism is classical liberalism of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:48.172]  That comes out of the Greek Republic.
[00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.972]  The first time they started actually voting.
[00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:53.953]  That is not what the left-hand path is.
[00:06:54.073 --> 00:06:55.754]  It is the Jacobins.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.122]  It is the Babylonian and Egyptian mystery schools, and it's 4,000 plus years old.
[00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:12.846]  And anyone that's a real historian, like Lord Monckton, will tell you that what we have is a fusion of the Jacobin system and the Chinese legalist system that's 4,000 plus years old as well.
[00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:17.648]  And it's very authoritarian by design.
[00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:27.632]   And it establishes authoritarianism through a bureaucratic system incrementally, but it slowly turns up the heat until the frog Perpetually boils forever.
[00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:34.057]  But what's really astounding about this interview is everything she says is true and Tucker's thanking her for having the courage.
[00:07:34.897 --> 00:07:35.958]  I'm not saying Tucker's wrong.
[00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:41.722]  In this day and age, as George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:07:41.782 --> 00:07:44.264]  But everybody should be talking about this.
[00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:48.186]  And here's my message to the left and the liberals and everybody else in between.
[00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:51.589]  You pretend that you're part of the establishment.
[00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:59.840]  And in any revolutionary movement that's run by the elite banks of the world, you will always be thrown to the side when it's all over.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.061]  You're not going to get free goodies.
[00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:02.943]  They're debasing the culture.
[00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:03.904]  They're debasing the borders.
[00:08:03.924 --> 00:08:05.005]  They're debasing the dollar.
[00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:07.087]  They are debasing your health.
[00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:11.991]  They are coming with poisonous forced inoculations and basically forced GMO.
[00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:18.016]  They are involved in a revolution against every hard-won freedom.
[00:08:18.817 --> 00:08:32.806]  And they're also run by very drugged out and mentally ill psychiatrists and psychologists that admittedly are writing articles in the New York Times or quoted in the New York Times saying, it's time to get rid of critical thinking.
[00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:45.974]  Well, yeah, you've got to get rid of critical thinking yourself as one of the managers of this system to go along with it because if you had critical thinking, you'd know that you are in the process of destroying your own bed, your own nest, your own lifeboat.
[00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:50.575]  Globalism is the ultimate elite program.
[00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:58.784]  It is the establishment waging war on the individual, on the family, on the means of production, on the human system itself.
[00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:04.229]  It is a scientific takeover of the human body and of every life form on Earth.
[00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:13.979]  You don't think that Monsanto 30 years ago just wanted to have soybean seeds or soybean plants that only grew once and didn't produce seeds that could produce another plant.
[00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:16.741]  They want a monopoly on the life cycle.
[00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:20.304]  And everyone pretending like you're part of the establishment are doing just that.
[00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.046]  We're in the age of fantasy.
[00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.047]  We're in the age of LARPing.
[00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:26.750]  We're in the age of virtual reality and Second Life, all the rest of it.
[00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.512]  But you have to shake yourselves out of it.
[00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:33.793]   I know our listeners are awake and have taken the Red pill taking the black pill.
[00:09:34.634 --> 00:09:39.258]  But we need to get the lost sheep out there that are being eaten by these wolves.
[00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:42.221]  So here is some of what Wolf had to say.
[00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:45.423]  Please remember, I don't know how much longer we'll be on air.
[00:09:45.443 --> 00:09:46.865]  I've told you how serious things are.
[00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:55.931]   Now what I already knew is public ongoing FBI investigations and Tiresome subpoenas and things like that that are meant to bankrupt us.
[00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:58.092]  So your financial support is critical.
[00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:00.473]  We have great products at infowarestore.com.
[00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:04.754]  We are fighting the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:07.496]  And the way it's all amplified is you spreading the word.
[00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:11.677]  So I want to thank all the stations, the listeners, the sponsors, and the great crew at InfoWars.
[00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:15.499]  Here is Naomi Wolf on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:22.034]  One person who apparently is not afraid to speak up is Naomi Wolf, who is undoubtedly losing friends by appearing on the show tonight.
[00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:27.577]  She's the author of The End of America, Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot, and the CEO of Daily Clout.
[00:10:27.597 --> 00:10:28.257]  She joins us tonight.
[00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:29.618]  Naomi Wolf, I appreciate your coming on.
[00:10:30.018 --> 00:10:33.200]  I never thought I would be talking to you, except in a debate format.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.041]  I'm sure we disagree on an awful lot.
[00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:38.903]  But on this, I was struck by the bravery it must have taken you to write it.
[00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:41.484]  I'm sure you lost friends over it, and for doing this.
[00:10:41.924 --> 00:10:44.706]  Tell us why you're doing this, and why you wrote that.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:49.353]  Well, first of all, thank you, Tucker.
[00:10:49.373 --> 00:10:51.396]  I'm really happy to be talking to you.
[00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:54.079]  It's not just that one tweet.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:02.531]  I've been writing pretty much every day for months and months about what I see as the terrible crisis that we're in.
[00:11:03.432 --> 00:11:15.581]  That we have to recognize, under the guise of a real medical pandemic, we're really moving into a coup situation, a police state situation, and that's not a partisan thing.
[00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:20.185]  As you say, that transcends everything you and I might agree or disagree on.
[00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:23.907]  Should bring together left and right to protect our Constitution.
[00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:26.909]  We're absolutely moving into what I call Step 10.
[00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:34.754]  I wrote a book in which I pointed out there were 10 steps that would-be tyrants always take when they want to close down a democracy.
[00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.357]  Whether they're on the left or the right, they always do the same 10 things.
[00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:41.579]  And now we're at something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime.
[00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:43.000]  You described it really, really well.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.722]  It is Step 10, and that's the suspension of the rule of law.
[00:11:47.243 --> 00:11:49.444]  That's when you start to be a police state, and we're here.
[00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:50.405]  There's no way around it.
[00:11:51.525 --> 00:12:11.434]  I'm so embarrassed and it's just it's another example, there are a million of them, of why partisanship is stupid and it makes you stupid and I guess I just assumed that we wouldn't agree on stuff so I didn't read your tweets and I obviously should have been and I missed a lot and so again it's nice to remember you should treat people as individuals rather than as stand-ins for whole political parties.
[00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:14.796]  You have been predicting this for a long time you just said.
[00:12:16.057 --> 00:12:18.798]  Why don't you think others aren't seeing this?
[00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:32.064]  Well, unfortunately, a lot of people are seeing it, but we're not unified, and as you pointed out, we're a very divided country for a lot of cynical reasons.
[00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:38.426]  I'm in touch with many patriots from all backgrounds and all walks of life who are horrified.
[00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:46.547]   I interviewed, for instance, Moms for Liberty, a group of conservative moms in Florida, who are mobilizing to try to get schools open.
[00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:48.547]  They're so worried about what's happening to their kids.
[00:12:48.547 --> 00:12:54.146]   And I talked to a mom, Jen Say, a famous gymnast and activist in San Francisco on the left,
[00:12:54.146 --> 00:12:56.146]  who's also a mom, who's horrified.
[00:12:56.146 --> 00:13:02.266]   I've interviewed doctors, I've interviewed ordinary people, restaurant owners from all walks of life,
[00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:11.385]   who are absolutely unable to even articulate their fear and horror, recognizing that the state
[00:13:11.385 --> 00:13:17.867]   has now crushed businesses, kept us from gathering in free assembly to worship, as the First Amendment
[00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:20.706]   provides, is invading our bodies, as you mentioned,
[00:13:20.706 --> 00:13:27.547]   which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, is restricting movement, fining us here in New York State.
[00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:34.225]   I could be fined $15,000 a day if I gather people, you know, more than 10 or 25 people,
[00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:38.867]   depending on where in New York State I live, you know, which is a complete violation
[00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:39.706]  of the First Amendment.
[00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:42.027]  I mean, the violations go on and on and on.
[00:13:42.027 --> 00:13:47.747]   I've talked to restaurant owners who are looking at a sector in which tens of thousands
[00:13:47.747 --> 00:13:49.667]  of small businesses have been crushed.
[00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:50.942]  And why were they crushed?
[00:13:51.002 --> 00:13:52.904]  Not because the pandemic forced them to.
[00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:56.809]  There is no real science underlying a lot of these closures.
[00:13:57.129 --> 00:14:02.449]   It's because autocratic tyrants at the state and now the national level are creating a
[00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:09.609]   kind of merger of corporate power and government power, which is really characteristic of Italian
[00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:11.829]  fascism in the '20s.
[00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:18.889]   And they're using that to engage in kind of emergency orders that simply strip us of our
[00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:23.129]   rights, rights to property, rights to assembly, rights to worship, and all of the rights that
[00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:24.648]  our Constitution guarantees.
[00:14:24.648 --> 00:14:27.648]  So people are definitely horrified and noticing.
[00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:32.329]   I think people are shocked and divided, as I mentioned before.
[00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:36.969]   And the other thing that happened is you said this has all been very sudden.
[00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:41.528]   And when you look back, you know, March of 2020, a lot of things started to move that
[00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:45.848]   kind of locked into place, a set of policies that are kind of 360 degree.
[00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:48.127]  Full-on totalitarian policies.
[00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.349]  So I think a lot of us are kind of in culture shock.
[00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.093]  Luckily or unluckily, I've been studying closing democracies for 12 years.
[00:14:56.153 --> 00:15:05.500]  So I recognized early on, you know, once I realized New York State had emergency powers, I know from history that no one gives up emergency powers willingly.
[00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:07.702]  They always drag it on and drag it on.
[00:15:07.722 --> 00:15:13.386]  And so every month I'm getting in my email an announcement that Governor Cuomo is extending emergency measures.
[00:15:13.707 --> 00:15:14.987]  Extending emergency measures.
[00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:28.299]  Only from studying history do I know how predictable it is when you start to have elected officials say, we are not going to follow the Constitution because there's a pandemic.
[00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:38.308]  And I just want to say, lastly, and then I promise I'll stop, nowhere in the Constitution does it say all this can be suspended if there's a bad disease.
[00:15:38.488 --> 00:15:44.379]   We have lived through typhus, cholera, smallpox, HIV, tuberculosis, polio, the
[00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:45.229]  Spanish flu.
[00:15:45.229 --> 00:15:47.729]  You know, we've lived through an attack on our soil.
[00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:52.429]   Never have there been months and months and months of emergency powers
[00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:55.029]  when we weren't actually fighting a war.
[00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:57.829]  So, this is completely unprecedented.
[00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:04.246]   Lockdowns have never been done before in free societies and really we're turning into a version of a
[00:16:04.246 --> 00:16:09.366]   totalitarian state sort of before everyone's eyes and I I really hope you know
[00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:14.406]   We wake up quickly because history also shows that it's a small window in which people can fight back
[00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:32.845]   Before it's too dangerous to fight back [Music]
[00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:38.766]   The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent *BOOM*
[00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:47.666]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[00:16:49.087 --> 00:16:56.151]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[00:16:57.324 --> 00:17:10.476]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:16.849]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:27.558]  Go to infowarrestore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:31.081]  Get your storable foods at infowarrestore.com.
