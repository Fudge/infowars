[00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:22.673]  Good evening.
[00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.354]  It's Thursday, January 5th, and this is the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:27.934]  I'm your fill-in host, Rob Dew.
[00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:37.116]  Alex is going to be in later in the show, interviewing, it's an amazing interview, with Edward T. Haslam, who wrote Dr. Mary's Monkey.
[00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:41.817]  This is a fascinating book, and let me tell you, it goes deep.
[00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.378]  It crosses JFK assassination with
[00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:54.968]  The whole cancer virus, the SV40 virus in the monkeys that was injected into people through vaccines.
[00:00:55.028 --> 00:00:55.990]  I mean, it's huge.
[00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.051]  This is a page turner.
[00:00:57.832 --> 00:00:59.454]  I'm just going to read this little back of the book.
[00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:00.195]  This is coming up.
[00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:01.958]  When New Orleans native
[00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:09.062]  Ed Haslam began his modest investigation into the curious life and shocking death of the brilliant Tulane medical professor, Dr. Mary Sherman.
[00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:18.407]  He couldn't have imagined that his inquiry would connect some of the city's most prominent citizens to lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald, to the mafia, and to forces high inside the U.S.
[00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:18.787]  government.
[00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:24.799]  Nor that these new discoveries would ultimately change our understanding of a faithful November day in Dallas.
[00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.580]  But they have.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.220]  So you want to stay tuned for that.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.341]  It's going to be a great interview.
[00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.941]  We recorded it earlier today.
[00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:35.063]  Alex told you guys earlier on the radio about his weightlifting incident.
[00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:39.845]  That's kind of left him really struggling to get deep breaths.
[00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.047]  And by the end of the day, he really is tired.
[00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:44.867]  So we're going to pick up the slack.
[00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:47.569]  I think Paul Joseph Watson is going to do the news tomorrow night.
[00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.390]  You got me tonight, so let's get on with the news.
[00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:55.353]  And once again, TSA and body scanners lead it off.
[00:01:55.773 --> 00:02:01.277]  Radiation Doctor says TSA naked body scanners can cause cancer, which we know this.
[00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:05.720]  We've been telling the TSA and their minions like this for many times and they don't want to listen.
[00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:20.321]  No matter how many times the TSA claims the machines are safe and pose no threat to travelers or personnel, naked body scanners that emit ionizing radiation are indeed a very serious health threat.
[00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:35.586]  Dr. Edward Dewar, head of radiology at Florida Medical Center, agrees, having recently come forward to explain that naked body scanners can cause cancer, particularly to those people over 65 and in women who are said to be genetically prone to developing breast cancer.
[00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:48.809]  And TSA continues to insist that ionizing radiation emitted from its backscatter x-ray naked body scanner is minimal, and that individuals are exposed to far more background radiation every single day just living their normal lives.
[00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.433]  But the agency has not provided any solid proof to this claim.
[00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:53.153]  Thank you!
[00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:09.608]  It goes on.
[00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:21.113]  This claim is highly misleading because background radiation on airplanes, for instance, is absorbed by the whole body, whereas during the naked body scan, it is focused directly on the skin and its underlying tissue.
[00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:36.380]  Furthermore, EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has repeatedly challenged the constitutionality of naked body scanners in the first place and is currently pressing a lawsuit to stop the entire program, which they say is unlawful and invasive.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.401]  And we know that.
[00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:43.139]  And then we look at the people who are running these naked body scanners and supposedly concerned about our security.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.820]  We go to this next story.
[00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.003]  TSA behavioral detection officer sentenced for helping drug dealers through security.
[00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:55.932]  Agents ensured marijuana traffickers avoided full body scanners.
[00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:59.475]  Boy, this article really goes into a lot of stuff.
[00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:03.598]  Minetta Walker was arrested last March by federal agents.
[00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:18.190]  Investigators discovered that Walker had helped traffickers move large amounts of cash through the airport, escorting them through security lines, directing them away from the naked body scanners and pat-down security lines, and ensuring their luggage bypassed the screening areas.
[00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:30.622]  Walker also aided at least one suspect, a narcotics trafficker, to fly under a false identity and warned at least one other suspect that police officers were conducting undercover surveillance on him.
[00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.825]  And this is where it gets really interesting.
[00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:55.751]  It was revealed on occasion Walker waited with suspected drug carriers at the aircraft departure gate ensuring they were able to avoid the random secondary screening which I've seen many times and it's really a pain in the butt because you're about to get on the plane you have all your stuff and they go sir please come over here we want to touch you and we want to check your drink and I've actually seen people
[00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:02.934]  In this process where one person gets their drink tested and then other people line up to get their drinks tested like it's a big fun thing.
[00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:03.915]  It's totally disgusting.
[00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:05.015]  Back to that quote.
[00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:10.078]  She did this while off duty but still wearing her TSA uniform.
[00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:13.008]  And you know, we have a litany.
[00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:18.671]  There's a great article that Steve Watson wrote for PrisonPlanet.com in February of last year.
[00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:20.772]  So this article is almost a year old.
[00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:23.833]  It's titled, Epidemic of TSA Criminality.
[00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:26.554]  More agents caught stealing cash from luggage.
[00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:28.215]  Another arrested for assault.
[00:05:28.275 --> 00:05:32.978]  And it goes through a litany of different crimes that they've engaged in.
[00:05:33.058 --> 00:05:35.339]  And it's all, you know, sourced.
[00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.281]  You go to the end of this article, get a shot of this right here.
[00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:44.103]  36 different sources.
[00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.344]  Get a document cam of this.
[00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:48.567]  He's got 36 sources from this article.
[00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:50.188]  It goes on and on.
[00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:56.693]  There's the 36 from Prison Planet, but he's got LA Times, he's got Atlantic Journal-Constitution.
[00:05:57.093 --> 00:05:57.973]  It's all in here.
[00:05:58.454 --> 00:05:59.435]  Go read this article.
[00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:03.317]  This is the kind of activity that the TSA engages in.
[00:06:03.938 --> 00:06:05.199]  It's becoming a regular basis.
[00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.112]  I'd really look out for that.
[00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:13.944]  But anyway, she gets busted for helping them bring drugs in.
[00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:14.846]  We got a clip of this.
[00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:16.389]  It talks a little bit about Ms.
[00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.830]  Walker.
[00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.132]  Let's go to that clip now.
[00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:36.737]  Agent pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States for using her unique role as a behavior detection officer to escort a local drug dealer as he carried a large amount of cash through security at Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
[00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:40.681]  She also alerted other drug suspects that they were under surveillance.
[00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:45.110]  Yeah, and so it gets better than that.
[00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:54.156]  There's then a government official who helped another guy get a false birth certificate that I guess she also helped on and then they eventually arrested her.
[00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:56.297]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:59.700]  Three other people have been arrested in this same investigation.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.983]  Two for dealing drugs and a third for helping one of them create a false birth certificate.
[00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:18.610]  Regina McCullen had worked in the clerk's office at City Hall and was recently sentenced to two years probation after admitting she helped a drug dealer create a fake birth certificate that he used to travel between Buffalo and Phoenix.
[00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:24.181]  And if you think that's bad, TSA is not just going to be sitting at the airports.
[00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:25.542]  They're going to be everywhere.
[00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:32.768]  We covered earlier in the year, or actually last year, that they had set up Viper checkpoints in Tennessee and it was unannounced.
[00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.671]  And then it came out that they had done over 900 of these.
[00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:37.972]  Here's another one.
[00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:42.156]  DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced
[00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:52.526]  I set up unannounced ID checkpoint and this is at a Florida Social Security office and they weren't informed of the drill and Homeland Security officials refused to talk to the media.
[00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:54.823]  And here's a quote here.
[00:07:55.744 --> 00:08:05.268]  A separate Homeland Security Viper recently received an expansion in funding from Congress that will see its 2011 figure of around 9,300 checkpoints.
[00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:05.868]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:06.148]  I said 900.
[00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:07.149]  It's actually 9,300.
[00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:16.913]  Increased with an addition of 12 new Viper teams that will be used to carry out security checks at bus depots, train stations, ferries, ports, and highways.
[00:08:17.273 --> 00:08:20.955]  So I told you 900 checkpoints and it's actually 9,300.
[00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:52.676]  Totally crazy these people are gonna be feeling you up everywhere you go wanting to know what you're doing What you're engaged in and then here we have an article written last year Almost a year ago today that talks a detail of them going into people's bags Taking money large amounts of cash not just $100, but 40,000 in one case How they were planning stuff on people And then how a lot of them are there's one here
[00:08:55.518 --> 00:09:02.223]  The guy started punching another person when one of these TSA workers started punching another person when he took his parking space.
[00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:07.267]  There's another one at LAX who flipped out and began screaming, I am God, I am in charge.
[00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:15.033]  And there's a TSA employee based in Atlanta that tried to kill himself after allegedly abducting a woman and sexually assaulting her.
[00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:21.660]  There's another TSA worker in Boston, Logan, who was charged with multiple sex crimes targeting an underage girl.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.960]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:27.203]  These are not the people that you want to charge your security, yet this is what we get.
[00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:28.104]  We get more of this.
[00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:35.568]  And we're going to go to that Tennessee checkpoint video now, and you can see how they're going after the citizens, trying to get them to spy on each other.
[00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:36.809]  It's really great.
[00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:37.689]  It's all for America.
[00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.430]  Let's go to that clip now.
[00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.772]  Tuesday, Tennessee was the first to do this simultaneously.
[00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:47.096]  Not only truck drivers, but cars, everybody should be aware of what's going on on the road.
[00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:48.617]  Especially like a box in the road.
[00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:17.812]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:10:18.713 --> 00:10:21.975]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:30.661]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:44.827]  The airport adventures which they now admit are going nationwide with the Viper teams at bus stops, train stops, the streets, shopping malls, random vans, sending you through body scanners, biometrically scanning 360, your naked body.
[00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:53.513]  Now TSA agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism with visible intermodal prevention and response or Viper operations.
[00:10:53.873 --> 00:11:00.498]  The Tennessee Highway Patrol is checking trucks with drug and bomb sniffing dogs during random inspections.
[00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.735]  The bottom line is this.
[00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:05.440]  If you see something suspicious, say something about it.
[00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:08.444]  If you see something, say something.
[00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:10.507]  If you see something, say something.
[00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:12.149]  Spy on your neighbor.
[00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.751]  You are a slave.
[00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:15.334]  You are a slave.
[00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:29.009]  It's incredible what goes on in this country on a daily basis as our economy is going down the tubes and the banks are looting everything and we got these nitpicking little fake security guards walking around.
[00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:33.554]  Which brings me up to a point, back to this TSA behavioral detection officer sentence.
[00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:42.382]  It said in the article, or actually in that news piece that we didn't put in, the judge said, we took the same oath and you violated yours.
[00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:44.152]  I don't know.
[00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:47.215]  I don't think TSA officers do take an oath.
[00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:49.016]  I believe that is incorrect.
[00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:54.239]  The judge, you know, this is just another case of people not knowing really what goes on in their world.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.181]  So, there you go.
[00:11:57.021 --> 00:12:04.827]  Continuing with the welfare state, you're going to have the security guards at your social security center picking up food stamps, making sure you spend them on the right kinds of junk food.
[00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:10.111]  The EU is going to plan to slap a VAT tax, which is a value added tax, on food.
[00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:20.456]  And they raised the VAT tax on everything but food and children's clothes by 20% last year, and now they want to include food and children's clothes.
[00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:31.582]  And these plans would add up to 20% of the cost of children's clothes and put an extra tax on books and newspapers, and it would be a strike for ignorance over education.
[00:12:32.443 --> 00:12:36.705]  And they want to do this in order to harmonize the sales tax across Europe.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.683]  The only thing they don't want to harmonize is the banks stealing money from you, and total corruption, and technocrats.
[00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:46.685]  They don't want to harmonize you from that, but they want to take more of your money.
[00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:48.526]  And now we go to this.
[00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:53.569]  Commuters spend a fifth of their wages on railfares as costs soar by up to 11 percent.
[00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:54.689]  This is from Mail Online.
[00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:05.956]  And a commuter's face with an inflation-busting 11 percent hike in prices will take little comfort from figures released today that show people are spending up to a fifth of their wages just to get to work.
[00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:07.089]  Wow.
[00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:18.881]  So, as the economy gets worse, the global economy, prices are going to rise, you're going to get less service, and you're going to get more TSA-type officials touching your genitals.
[00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:25.420]  Let's move on to Ron Paul and the election that was, or the caucus, I guess, that was stolen from him.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.941]  We have a clip here, and we found this today.
[00:13:28.302 --> 00:13:40.207]  One of our listeners sent this in to us, and it has Linda Wertheimer from NPR interviewing Edith Pepper, and she's the Republican chair of Clinton County.
[00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:45.189]  And this is what she had to say about all the weird happenings that went on that night.
[00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:46.350]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:13:47.433 --> 00:14:01.005]  I had received a phone call, this is Edith, I had received a phone call about 1120 from the Romney worker who had been working in our county and he said he needed the count.
[00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:04.108]  And I said, well, why do you need the count for 2-2?
[00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:06.491]  And he said, well, they don't have it in Des Moines.
[00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:08.713]  And I said, but I know they were called in.
[00:14:10.054 --> 00:14:13.136]  And he said, well, I think that there was a computer glitch.
[00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:15.137]  That the computers went down.
[00:14:15.558 --> 00:14:17.119]  And I said, oh, okay.
[00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:21.641]  And so I gave him the requested numbers.
[00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:26.664]  And so did your own precinct, did Clinton County come out the way you thought it would?
[00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:33.388]  I really thought that Ron Paul was going to do a little better than he did tonight.
[00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:36.971]  So as you can see, she thought Ron Paul was going to win.
[00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:39.039]  Yet it didn't turn out that way.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.206]  Mitt Romney took that county, I think, by a little over 200 votes.
[00:14:45.087 --> 00:14:50.233]  She didn't see it that way, but when the Romney people called and got the numbers, everything seemed to work out fine.
[00:14:51.271 --> 00:14:53.632]  We've got another article from the Red Dirt Report.
[00:14:53.853 --> 00:14:54.833]  Cockeyed Hawkeyes.
[00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:57.375]  Romney wins in Paul Friendly Super Caucus.
[00:14:57.395 --> 00:14:59.616]  Here's a different caucus in a different county.
[00:15:00.997 --> 00:15:01.777]  Let's see.
[00:15:02.978 --> 00:15:07.161]  It was Coralville just outside Iowa City.
[00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:17.812]  And at the Super Caucus, Red Dirt Report covered in Coralville, Iowa, just outside Iowa City, there was not a single Romney sign visible in or around the large conference center.
[00:15:18.392 --> 00:15:24.799]  Yet he would go on to win, despite Ron Paul signs outnumbering the Rick Santorum and Rick Perry signs 7-1.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.703]  And if you go back to the original, go back to that first graphic.
[00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:33.166]  That actually shows the Coralville presidential straw poll results.
[00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:38.809]  You see Ron Paul there with twice as many as Romney had in that particular district.
[00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.611]  And then we got this long quote here.
[00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.752]  Where did Romney's support come from in Coralville?
[00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:50.555]  He would get 262 votes according to the Des Moines Register, and Ron Paul would get 203.
[00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:55.358]  Precinct 4, which we covered, overwhelmingly went to Paul, which we saw in those numbers.
[00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:56.498]  He got double of Romney.
[00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:57.279]  More than double.
[00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:13.892]  And there seemed to be a lot of activity going on in Precinct 6, and in Brad's blog, he put up the rules, that they actually made a change to the rules right before the caucus, and it was to allow no photo ID necessary for any voter in the Republican Iowa caucus.
[00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:25.335]  And I guarantee you, I've heard this issue raised up many times by the Republicans, about how they want to have IDs on everybody who's going to vote, so it keeps illegals from voting and all this.
[00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:28.216]  But it doesn't matter in the Iowa Republican Caucus.
[00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:29.076]  Then it doesn't matter.
[00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:34.938]  As many people as we can step through the door to vote for our two shill warmongering candidates, we're going to do that.
[00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:45.202]  Because we either want Obama in, or we want Romney in, or maybe, I don't think they really want Santorum or Gingrich, but I think it's going to be this push for Romney, that he's our savior.
[00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:47.876]  Let's go back to that long quote at the end of it.
[00:16:48.637 --> 00:16:54.781]  Rick Santorum has no organization, never drew over a hundred people during his entire campaign, they're talking about in Iowa.
[00:16:55.422 --> 00:17:03.347]  Of course he did bribe and receive benediction of that family leader who demanded one million dollars, which he would distribute in part to cronies.
[00:17:03.387 --> 00:17:09.772]  That family leader was Bob Vander Plaats, which leads us to an ABC article published in late December.
[00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:13.194]  Iowa conservative leader mired in controversy after
[00:17:14.455 --> 00:17:23.439]  Rick Santorum endorsement and it goes to Santorum acknowledged in an interview with CNN that he talked with Vander Plaats.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.903]  What we talked about was he needed money to promote the endorsement and that that would be important to do that, Santorum told CNN.
[00:17:31.243 --> 00:17:35.145]  There was never a direct ask for me to go out and raise money for it.
[00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:45.051]  But then later in another ABC News on Monday night interview, you had Santorum's National Communications Director Hogan Gidley who said,
[00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:06.646]  I think so.
[00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:34.945]  A former staffer for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential bid, who is currently unaffiliated with the campaign, said Vander Plaats came to them seeking money for backing if he supported the former Massachusetts governor.
[00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:37.486]  He wanted to be paid, the former staffer said.
[00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:39.207]  He was clearly looking for a paycheck.
[00:18:39.907 --> 00:18:45.530]  There was a conversation about him getting a title, but being a pay consultant was much more important.
[00:18:46.573 --> 00:18:52.735]  So you have this religious leader in Iowa who's looking for money, and with that money, he's going to go out and get influence.
[00:18:52.996 --> 00:19:07.041]  And I think if you follow the money, that's where you'll see it will lie to Vander Plaats, helping out Rick Santorum, especially in those rural counties where it's all done gentlemanly, like what we heard from Karl Rove last night, which we're going to play right now.
[00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:10.593]  Romney is going to win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes.
[00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:12.754]  How solid is your evidence?
[00:19:13.395 --> 00:19:15.036]  From a pretty good, reliable source.
[00:19:15.096 --> 00:19:23.100]  They made the correction in Story County, which moved it from an 18 point margin for Santorum to a 4 vote margin for Santorum.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:37.029]  Clinton County, you have the one outstanding precinct in the state, and that it will show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory of 14 votes over Romney.
[00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:40.111]  From out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum!
[00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:44.113]  You're saying that they basically have come to an agreement as to what the vote's gonna be?
[00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:48.556]  The official, the person who's got the official piece of paper is missing.
[00:19:49.217 --> 00:19:54.000]  But the Romney and Santorum people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:02.806]  They apparently have rounded up the representatives of the camps who have agreed, yes, we were there, we know exactly what the vote total was, and we both agree to what it was.
[00:20:03.326 --> 00:20:06.108]  So the official was Edith Pfeffer.
[00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:08.886]  She was at her home sleeping.
[00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:15.113]  She had already called in the results, or so she claimed, so she reported on NPR, yet there was a computer glitch.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.441]  There you go, that's how it happens.
[00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:25.906]  Even though Ron Paul got third place in Iowa, he seems to be blowing out everybody else, including Barack Obama in merchandise sales.
[00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:34.772]  Cafe Press, which allows you to build merchandise and sell them kind of as you sell it, they make it type thing.
[00:20:34.792 --> 00:20:36.933]  54% of the items sold in 2011 were Ron Paul.
[00:20:40.225 --> 00:20:46.992]  Eighteen went to President Obama, eleven percent went to Rick Perry, and nine percent went to Mitt Romney.
[00:20:47.653 --> 00:20:49.295]  Mittens Romney, as they call him.
[00:20:49.976 --> 00:20:54.360]  And just to let you know, we offer a few t-shirts, Ron Paul t-shirts, here at InfoWars.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.445]  So if you want to support Ron Paul, support our operation,
[00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:00.096]  There you go.
[00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:01.257]  Pick up a Ron Paul t-shirt.
[00:21:01.397 --> 00:21:02.597]  Let people know out there.
[00:21:02.617 --> 00:21:04.138]  Let's keep putting up signs.
[00:21:04.178 --> 00:21:06.519]  Let's keep putting up bumper stickers.
[00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:09.540]  Let's keep showing people that Ron Paul is the people's candidate.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.783]  He's not bought by these giant corporations that want to warmonger and tell the rest of the world what to do.
[00:21:15.303 --> 00:21:16.083]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:21:16.103 --> 00:21:16.704]  We're going to come back.
[00:21:16.724 --> 00:21:22.346]  We're going to show a little clip last night from Cobra Commander, who visited us, and a whole bunch more.
[00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:27.989]  We got some GlaxoSmithKline news, and then we got Alex's amazing interview with Edward T. Haslam.
[00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:29.653]  Hooray Dr. Mary's monkey!
[00:21:29.673 --> 00:21:32.404]  It's InfoWars Nightly News and I'm your host Rob Doo.
[00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:37.464]  America is in trouble.
[00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:39.466]  Washington is a disgrace.
[00:21:39.706 --> 00:21:41.087]  Government has become too big.
[00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.948]  It's overtaxing, overspending.
[00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:44.509]  We need to change direction.
[00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:45.650]  We really need change.
[00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.452]  We can't afford to make the same mistakes we've made in the past.
[00:21:48.572 --> 00:21:50.754]  Mitt Romney's reputation is a flip-flop.
[00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:54.017]  He went the other way when he got paid to go the other way.
[00:21:54.037 --> 00:21:55.978]  There is need for economic stimulus.
[00:21:56.018 --> 00:21:57.699]  It's about serial hypocrisy.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.521]  This election is about trust.
[00:21:59.721 --> 00:22:03.044]  There's been one true consistent candidate, and that's Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:06.106]  Ron Paul has been so consistent from the very beginning.
[00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:08.187]  He seems like a more honest candidate.
[00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:10.869]  He tells the truth about what he believes, whether you like it or not.
[00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:15.672]  He's never once voted for a tax increase, never once voted for an unbalanced budget.
[00:22:15.692 --> 00:22:18.533]  Ron Paul's plan is bold, cuts five departments.
[00:22:18.874 --> 00:22:19.574]  It's what we need.
[00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:23.336]  When he says he's gonna cut a trillion dollars in the first year, I believe it.
[00:22:23.356 --> 00:22:28.559]  If you don't like how things are going, you're tired of politicians, he's something different.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.420]  Ron Paul.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.100]  Ron Paul.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.821]  Ron Paul.
[00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:31.641]  Ron Paul.
[00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:33.322]  Is the one we've been looking for.
[00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:35.804]  I'm Ron Paul and I approve this message.
[00:22:41.348 --> 00:22:41.968]  And we are back.
[00:22:42.008 --> 00:22:43.649]  It's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:59.358]  We're putting other special reports up.
[00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.719]  Alex also has a special rant page that he does.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.781]  It's just filled with a lot of stuff.
[00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:05.381]  Go check it out.
[00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:08.783]  InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:09.943 --> 00:23:14.005]  And don't forget we had that interview with author Edward T. Haslam.
[00:23:14.405 --> 00:23:15.766]  Dr. Mary's Monkey is coming up.
[00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:19.848]  But first, let's talk some Cobra Commander.
[00:23:21.188 --> 00:23:25.590]  Last night we had a special visit from international terrorist Cobra Commander.
[00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:30.693]  The actual Cobra Commander appeared and declared his intent to run for the presidency and
[00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:34.352]  I thought it was so great, I'm just going to play a clip from it.
[00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:37.957]  Here he is announcing his bid for presidency of the United States.
[00:23:38.758 --> 00:23:43.523]  Miss Napolitano, I'm sorry to reveal your identity, I mean forget that, Cobra Commander.
[00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:47.061]  Why are you agreeing to this interview?
[00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:49.762]  You said you had some special announcement for us.
[00:23:50.503 --> 00:23:52.924]  Please tell us what that is, sir.
[00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:54.565]  I am the leader.
[00:23:55.026 --> 00:23:56.487]  I am Cobra Commander.
[00:23:56.867 --> 00:24:08.214]  I have agreed to this interview so that you might know that I have decided to go public and to have a public stock offering in Cobra Global Enterprises.
[00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:11.756]  I intend to issue my own fiat currency.
[00:24:12.177 --> 00:24:13.618]  But before I do that,
[00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:22.465]  I intend to sue Homeland Security for copyright and trademark infringement.
[00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:24.547]  Black uniforms.
[00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.248]  Black uniforms.
[00:24:26.969 --> 00:24:27.810]  Ski masks.
[00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.011]  Checkpoints.
[00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.533]  Black armored tanks on the streets.
[00:24:32.014 --> 00:24:33.175]  Preemptive war.
[00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:34.396]  Torture!
[00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:36.698]  Wireless wiretapping!
[00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:42.144]  Total tyranny is the new freedom that Cobra has taught the world!
[00:24:42.645 --> 00:24:54.778]  And now Joe and the Pentagon have stolen my plan and hired Al-Qaeda to carry out their operations in Libya, which they formerly did for me!
[00:24:55.979 --> 00:25:03.021]  Now clearly America and the rest of the system has realized that I am the true visionary.
[00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:12.803]  And so I now announce to you and the world the greatest moment in the history of Cobra!
[00:25:13.243 --> 00:25:14.964]  Cobra!
[00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:29.161]  I will now sit for President and run on the Republican Party ticket against that plagiarized Barack Obama that's stolen so many of my ideas!
[00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:41.644]  Clearly an America that loves indefinite detention and the NDAA and torture and secret arrest is ready to be ruled by a true tyrant!
[00:25:42.464 --> 00:25:46.688]  I was a snake and an oppressor before it was cool!
[00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:48.989]  Hail Cobra!
[00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.230]  Cobra!
[00:25:50.731 --> 00:25:53.973]  I am running for President of the United States!
[00:25:54.554 --> 00:25:55.474]  And from America!
[00:25:56.415 --> 00:26:01.499]  I will congenure the policy of global corporate war against the third world!
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.461]  Death and destruction!
[00:26:03.941 --> 00:26:05.483]  Forced inoculations!
[00:26:05.803 --> 00:26:07.004]  Hail Cobra!
[00:26:07.674 --> 00:26:08.815]  And that was Cobra Commander.
[00:26:08.855 --> 00:26:11.276]  We got a lot of feedback from that, mostly positive.
[00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:26.805]  A lot of people, well not a lot of people, some people don't understand when Alex does these things they think he might be, you know, discrediting the movement or something, but I tell you what, it does let off a lot of steam and for people out there who are asleep and who aren't awake, this could
[00:26:27.225 --> 00:26:27.285]  Yes.
[00:26:57.545 --> 00:26:58.647]  Kudos to Alex for doing that.
[00:26:59.427 --> 00:27:00.288]  Now let's move on.
[00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:04.893]  GSK Lab find over vaccine test that killed 14 babies.
[00:27:05.614 --> 00:27:14.644]  And it seems like GlaxoSmithKline, because they can't test their poison on the people here in the United States, have to go to South America and dupe those people.
[00:27:14.684 --> 00:27:17.847]  I think they were duping people with like 28 page consent forms.
[00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:18.828]  I mean, ridiculous.
[00:27:19.449 --> 00:27:36.224]  So GlaxoSmithKline Argentina Laboratories was fined 400,000 pesos by Judge Anguski following a report issued by the National Administration of Medicine, Food and Technology for the killing of 14 babies during illegal lab vaccine trials conducted between 2007 and 2008.
[00:27:36.344 --> 00:27:45.832]  The charges included experimenting with human beings, falsifying parental authorization so babies could participate in the vaccine trials conducted by the laboratory.
[00:27:46.793 --> 00:27:57.402]  The doctors took advantage of these many illiterate parents who take their children for treatment by pressuring and forcing them into signing these 28-page consent forms involved in the trials.
[00:27:58.763 --> 00:28:08.631]  Once a picked patient arrived, it would automatically disappear, be taken somewhere, and in order to be treated by those doctors specifically recruited by GSK.
[00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:13.514]  These kinds of practices are not legal and occurred without any type of state control.
[00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:14.875]  It goes on.
[00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:24.619]  It is also known that in various particular cases, the doctors who conducted these trials did not answer the calls made by worried parents after witnessing their baby's reactions to vaccines.
[00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:33.842]  This is a total crime that goes on repeatedly by these companies who wrap themselves with lawyers and legislation that protects them.
[00:28:34.783 --> 00:28:36.183]  It's sick.
[00:28:36.904 --> 00:28:40.505]  The precursor to that is the SV40 virus, which is covered in this book.
[00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.686]  It's going to be an amazing interview coming up.
[00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:44.626]  With Alex Jones in just a few minutes.
[00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:46.107]  We've got two more stories to go to.
[00:28:46.127 --> 00:28:49.747]  We're going to go to a quick break and then come back to that interview with Alex.
[00:28:51.348 --> 00:28:58.069]  From Natural News, Women Fight Class Action Lawsuit Against Frito-Lay for Marketing Genetically Modified Snacks as All Natural.
[00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:02.190]  And this made me sick because I actually eat one of these brands.
[00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:11.872]  Frito-Lay is the subject of a new class action lawsuit that pegs the company for illegally marketing its snack products, which are loaded with GM ingredients, as being all natural.
[00:29:13.095 --> 00:29:24.764]  Represented by Milberg, LLP of Los Angeles, Julie Gingo of Richmond, California, recently filed a class action lawsuit against Frito-Lay, alleging that the snack products are fraudulently labeled.
[00:29:25.405 --> 00:29:32.631]  Frito-Lay Sun Chips, Tostitos products are made with GM vegetable oils and potentially even GM corn.
[00:29:33.928 --> 00:29:35.669]  But they're both labeled as being all-natural.
[00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:45.075]  But GMO products are not all-natural ingredients and are in fact admittedly synthetic, which makes any product that contains them unnatural.
[00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:47.457]  And that's even by their own definition.
[00:29:47.497 --> 00:29:49.518]  You can go to the Monsanto website.
[00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:58.464]  The company defines GMO on its website as food with genetic makeup altered to exhibit traits that are not naturally theirs.
[00:29:58.524 --> 00:30:01.066]  So they even use the term unnatural.
[00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:02.627]  So kudos to Julie.
[00:30:03.487 --> 00:30:07.449]  Hopefully they do some of that and I will not be eating sun chips ever again.
[00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:09.589]  I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
[00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:15.812]  You keep learning this stuff, you keep educating yourself, and eventually you say no, you draw your line in the sand.
[00:30:16.792 --> 00:30:19.573]  Which leads us to our final article of the evening.
[00:30:20.134 --> 00:30:20.574]  Busted!
[00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:23.115]  Scientists leave out data to produce bogus findings.
[00:30:24.116 --> 00:30:34.158]  The BMJ, which is the British Medical Journal, is sounding the alarm that data reported by scientists is too often not the truth because researchers leave out inconvenient data.
[00:30:34.178 --> 00:30:37.139]  Kind of like the inconvenient truth with Al Gore.
[00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:41.820]  Turns out that this is no once in a while kind of problem either.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:50.182]  The BMJ claims a large proportion of the evidence from human trials is unreported and much of what is reported is done so inadequately.
[00:30:51.658 --> 00:30:53.319]  And then it goes into a little more commentary.
[00:30:53.359 --> 00:31:05.227]  Big pharma's pills and potions are often pushed based on studies that simply ignore and leave out major data about what is really discovered about a medication lacking of benefits, potential dangerous side effects, and more.
[00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:14.606]  And two additional studies show the requirements for mandatory trial, registration, and timely sharing of results are poorly followed, if at all.
[00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.427]  And you know why this happens?
[00:31:16.447 --> 00:31:17.628]  I'm going to tell you why this happens.
[00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:20.469]  It's because most of these studies are paid for by the drug companies.
[00:31:20.829 --> 00:31:27.332]  And if you're a company that's receiving money from a drug company to do different types of studies, what are you going to do if you want to keep that contract?
[00:31:27.632 --> 00:31:29.453]  Well, you're going to get the results that they ask for.
[00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:31.353]  That's how it's done in this country.
[00:31:31.713 --> 00:31:32.534]  It's done with money.
[00:31:32.854 --> 00:31:35.275]  That's how elections are stolen, like what we saw in Iowa.
[00:31:36.766 --> 00:31:37.926]  Go to a final bit here.
[00:31:38.426 --> 00:31:39.907]  We have a couple letters.
[00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:42.247]  Actually, these emails were on my chair this morning.
[00:31:43.627 --> 00:31:50.209]  And if you want to send us letters, you can email me, which is robd at Infowars.com, or write us at Infowars.com, P.O.
[00:31:50.229 --> 00:31:54.110]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.070]  First one is from Eugene.
[00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:00.431]  And he says, Hi, greetings from Israel.
[00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:04.112]  We listen to your show here, and also let me tell you, it is fascinating.
[00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:05.492]  Keep up the good work, Eugene.
[00:32:07.535 --> 00:32:08.976]  And a final one here from Jeff.
[00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:32.935]  You put into bringing out the truth to the American people and know that you have support with many of us in uniform.
[00:32:33.575 --> 00:32:39.778]  So please feel free to write us tips, suggestions, anything you'd like, and we'll read it on the air every once in a while.
[00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:40.779]  So we get some in.
[00:32:40.999 --> 00:32:42.619]  These just happened to be on my desk this morning.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.501]  Alex told me I was doing the news, so I said, well, you know what?
[00:32:45.601 --> 00:32:50.103]  I'm going to show a couple of these letters to the people out there and that they do come in.
[00:32:50.443 --> 00:32:53.705]  And I think it was interesting, one from Israel, one from a soldier stationed overseas.

[00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:02.804]  Thank you for joining us on this Thursday, 5th of January, 2012 edition.
[00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.551]  Wow, we're almost through the first week of 2012.
[00:34:08.111 --> 00:34:08.491]  Amazing.
[00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:21.395]  I want to thank Rob Dew for doing the news portion of InfoWars Nightly News tonight, and I'll have a comment on the TSA and its armed ID checkpoint in Florida at the end of the interview we're about to do.
[00:34:21.835 --> 00:34:31.678]  Now, a few years ago, I read the intriguing book, Dr. Mary's Monkey, and a lot of this is original research, but some of it I had actually seen in other government documents.
[00:34:31.698 --> 00:34:32.218]  That's right.
[00:34:52.135 --> 00:35:11.682]  In this book, now this is just a 20 minute interview tonight, but I want to get Edward T. Haslam, the author of Dr. Mary's Monkey, back on the Syndicated Radio Show sometime in the next few weeks to really break this down because what reminded me of this book and made me pull it off the bookshelf and reread parts of it again was a few weeks ago we all saw the
[00:35:12.862 --> 00:35:13.882]  We're good to go.
[00:35:40.328 --> 00:35:42.128]  Are they being given weaponized cancer?
[00:35:42.148 --> 00:35:48.150]  So one of the leading researchers in this area is Edward T. Haslam, author of Dr. Mary's Monkey.
[00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.091]  And by the way, it's put out by a great publisher, Trine Day.
[00:35:51.131 --> 00:35:53.311]  If you want to find out more, look them up online.
[00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:56.392]  It's also in quite a few bookstores and obviously on Amazon.
[00:35:56.432 --> 00:35:57.992]  But here's the man himself.
[00:35:58.653 --> 00:35:59.753]  Great to have you with us.
[00:36:00.673 --> 00:36:02.494]  What got you onto the path of this?
[00:36:02.574 --> 00:36:03.934]  And boil down the book for us.
[00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:13.613]  Well, Alex, I'm from New Orleans, and my father was a doctor at Tulane Medical School, and one of his best friends, Dr. Mary Sherman, was murdered.
[00:36:14.194 --> 00:36:26.584]  So, the book is first and foremost an investigation into her murder, and the deeper I got into this, the more I realized that she was an expert in cancer and in radiation, and she worked for Dr. Alt Noshner.
[00:36:27.905 --> 00:36:32.987]  Who was involved with the framing of Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans.
[00:36:33.768 --> 00:36:47.373]  And I heard rumors way back in the 1960s that David Ferry, who Jim Garrison was pursuing on the JFK assassination, had an underground medical laboratory with this Dr. Mary Sherman.
[00:36:47.973 --> 00:36:53.856]  And what I knew that others did not know was that Mary Sherman was a world-class expert
[00:36:54.496 --> 00:37:04.298]  And so you have this weird connection of world-class expert and looney-tune political right-winger, and that's a dangerous combination of events.
[00:37:04.398 --> 00:37:18.781]  So I started looking into it, and I realized that the entire story around Mary Sherman's murder had been faked, because what happened to her was never told to the public, and she got her arm blown off by a linear particle accelerator.
[00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:20.522]  Which they were using.
[00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:25.705]  That's a radioactive piece of equipment which they were using to mutate monkey viruses.
[00:37:26.145 --> 00:37:43.235]  And the reason they were doing this originally was because 200 million doses of the polio vaccine that had been distributed to the American public in the 1950s and 60s was contaminated with a cancer-causing virus by the name of SV40.
[00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:47.738]  And they originally were looking for a vaccine.
[00:37:48.487 --> 00:37:54.375]  To try to stop this cancer, which is today causing a cancer epidemic in America and elsewhere.
[00:37:55.096 --> 00:37:59.462]  And right when they were doing that, that's when the Russian missiles come into Cuba.
[00:38:00.371 --> 00:38:14.260]  And New Orleans, a lot of the economy in New Orleans was disrupted by that embargo of Cuba and the sugar and all that other stuff and the threat of Castro's taking this revolution to the rest of Latin America and spreading it.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:22.165]  It threatened the entire system of cheap labor and coffee beans and bananas and all that stuff that was coming into New Orleans.
[00:38:22.665 --> 00:38:25.707]  So the decision was made in the spring of 1963 to weaponize
[00:38:29.729 --> 00:38:34.315]  The monkey viruses that they were researching in this secret facility.
[00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:39.601]  This is like a medical Manhattan project hidden on US government property in uptown New Orleans.
[00:38:40.261 --> 00:38:47.770]  And it's located right down the street from the personal residence of the guy that used to be the president of the American Cancer Society and right down the other street.
[00:38:48.564 --> 00:38:51.106]  Is Lee Harvey Oswald who's part of this project.
[00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:52.506]  He's like a courier runner.
[00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:56.129]  And then they bring in this woman who's an expert.
[00:38:56.389 --> 00:39:00.931]  She's very young at the time, but she's an expert in handling cancer-causing viruses.
[00:39:01.011 --> 00:39:02.712]  And we know about her training and all that.
[00:39:03.333 --> 00:39:05.654]  And they spend the summer weaponizing this.
[00:39:05.854 --> 00:39:08.616]  They test it on a prisoner.
[00:39:09.256 --> 00:39:10.497]  Several prisoners in fact.
[00:39:10.797 --> 00:39:20.441]  The prisoner dies in 28 days and that's when Lee takes off from Mexico City to bring the weapon down there so they can try to smuggle it into Cuba and kill Fidel Castro.
[00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:23.563]  Of course we also know that Jack Ruby
[00:39:24.215 --> 00:39:24.615]  I think so.
[00:39:44.146 --> 00:39:56.895]  And in the 60s we were told viruses couldn't cause cancer, but I can show you a 1959 Time Magazine article where they're talking about cancer-causing viruses and the ability to come up with vaccines.
[00:39:57.155 --> 00:40:03.240]  And today we have the HPV vaccine, which is intended to prevent a cancer-causing virus.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.521]  They can no longer say there are no cancer-causing viruses because they're out there marketing them.
[00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:16.344]  Sure, I've seen Rockefeller Foundation documents in the 20s and 30s where the Rockefellers were looking at most cancer being viral.
[00:40:16.984 --> 00:40:17.524]  Absolutely.
[00:40:18.024 --> 00:40:19.885]  I mean, these people have been obsessed with this forever.
[00:40:19.905 --> 00:40:21.025]  But you mentioned Dr. Henneman.
[00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:24.986]  In a separate report from
[00:40:26.926 --> 00:40:27.366]  P.S.
[00:40:47.293 --> 00:40:55.776]  Weird humor, but it's very real that they knew that the polio vaccine that we took over to Russia was full of this.
[00:40:56.236 --> 00:41:06.760]  See, when they made this vaccine, they grew it on monkey kidneys, and they got out all of the viruses that were in the monkeys' kidneys, and all those viruses got into the polio vaccine.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.322]  And the problem was they were caging monkeys from different continents together.
[00:41:11.822 --> 00:41:16.484]  So the Asian monkey was also cross-infected with viruses from the African monkey.
[00:41:16.904 --> 00:41:34.546]  So when they started zapping this stuff with radiation to cure it, they were hitting both the SV40, which was the Asian monkeys virus, and in that same concoction was SIV, which is the simian immunodeficiency virus, which is the ancestor to the AIDS virus.
[00:41:35.467 --> 00:41:36.989]  Wow, this is just bombshell.
[00:41:37.049 --> 00:41:43.717]  And for those that are new viewers, I hope they research what you're saying because everything you're talking about I've separately seen.
[00:41:43.737 --> 00:41:44.938]  I mean, you're telling the truth.
[00:41:45.299 --> 00:41:47.942]  It's just, this is so, so incredible.
[00:41:50.563 --> 00:42:02.046]  To go back to the fact that your father actually knew and had worked with this lady, and I guess you began to investigate the death itself, and then that's what brought you into all of this.
[00:42:02.847 --> 00:42:06.488]  That's similar to my story, just looking into politics.
[00:42:07.588 --> 00:42:10.930]  And then I began to research things, and it just led me to the conspiratorial view.
[00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.572]  Not because I'm a conspiracy theorist, but because we do have these cabals operating.
[00:42:15.612 --> 00:42:21.755]  Now, going back, you have quite a few documents in your book from Jim Garrison and his investigation.
[00:42:21.775 --> 00:42:25.857]  He was able to end up getting some government documents that they didn't want him to have.
[00:42:26.237 --> 00:42:27.538]  Break down some of those.
[00:42:29.144 --> 00:42:38.619]  Well, Jim Garrison came to the conclusion, finally, that Lee Oswald was an undercover agent who had penetrated the plot to kill Kennedy.
[00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:41.825]  That's the same conclusion that we come to.
[00:42:45.088 --> 00:42:55.616]  Garrison did discover up in Clinton, Louisiana that Oswald was up there with Clay Shaw, and the heart of Garrison's case was the connection between Oswald and Clay Shaw.
[00:42:55.696 --> 00:43:01.860]  And Clay Shaw said, you know, I didn't know the guy, and, you know, he lied in court, and the federal government wouldn't let Garrison pursue it.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.684]  But what they were doing up in Clinton, Louisiana, and Clinton and Jackson, which is right next door to Clinton,
[00:43:08.044 --> 00:43:08.305]  Yes.
[00:43:22.861 --> 00:43:24.162]  We're good to go.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:51.926]  Black Cadillac pull into the square and the town marshal, John Manchester, went over there and said, let me see your ID.
[00:43:51.946 --> 00:43:55.208]  And the guy said, I'm Clay Shaw from the International Trademark.
[00:43:55.268 --> 00:43:58.050]  And Lee Oswald gets out of the car and tries to register to vote.
[00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:10.659]  So we've got sworn congressional testimony putting Clay Shaw and Lee Oswald together in this town where they were murdering the prisoner in order to test the weapon.
[00:44:11.377 --> 00:44:11.817]  Wow.
[00:44:12.138 --> 00:44:13.399]  That's Nazi science.
[00:44:14.019 --> 00:44:15.720]  Well, we know about Huntsville, Texas.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:22.025]  It's now been admitted that for decades they've done testing, chemical, biological, on the state prisoners here in Texas.
[00:44:22.065 --> 00:44:24.687]  This is going on all over the place.
[00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:29.230]  And of course, we have the real congressional report saying that it was a conspiracy with Kennedy.
[00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.993]  And then you have the separate whitewash Warren Commission that the mainstream media
[00:44:33.713 --> 00:44:34.454]  Give us the attention.
[00:44:35.114 --> 00:44:39.136]  You know, in the 10 minutes we've got left or so, obviously, we could talk for hours about this amazing book.
[00:44:39.156 --> 00:44:40.077]  People should get it and read it.
[00:44:40.097 --> 00:44:42.558]  I'm going to have you back on the radio to really break it down.
[00:44:43.478 --> 00:44:45.379]  Why is this so important for us today?
[00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:54.524]  I mean, obviously, if they had weaponized cancer that killed people in 28 days back in the 60s, imagine what they've got now with all the genetic technology.
[00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:56.486]  Well, Alex,
[00:44:57.921 --> 00:45:05.768]  Bernice Eddy, who was the vaccine safety tester at the National Institute of Health, tried to warn us about it in 1959.
[00:45:06.328 --> 00:45:15.195]  She knew about the contamination of the polio vaccine and she was trying to tell us there is going to be an epidemic of cancer in the United States.
[00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:23.162]  Now, my point is we got back 15 cases of cancer per year for every case of polio.
[00:45:24.122 --> 00:45:32.835]  I mean, the cancer epidemic is more than 10 times the size of the polio epidemic, yet you never hear the word epidemic in the mainstream.
[00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:33.879]  Why not?
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:40.584]  Why was polio an epidemic at 50,000 cases a year and cancer not an epidemic at nearly 2 million cases a year?
[00:45:40.984 --> 00:45:45.007]  I mean, on September 11th, okay, we lost 3,000 people to terrorism.
[00:45:45.147 --> 00:45:52.011]  That same day, we lost more than 3,000 people to cancer, and every day since then, we have lost 3,000 people to cancer.
[00:45:52.392 --> 00:45:56.635]  I mean, we are now running at a million and a half, two million since September 11th,
[00:45:57.635 --> 00:45:59.596]  No, I'm sorry, we're at 12 million now.
[00:45:59.636 --> 00:46:20.283]  And let's be clear, the magnitude, the United States leads the world in cancer, it's clearly a large portion of it linked to these cancer viruses that they admit hundreds of millions of Americans were exposed to, and I've talked to scientists, they state, well I saw it on CBS News last year, they're still giving people polio vaccines, oral and shot, that have it.
[00:46:20.523 --> 00:46:22.944]  This is not an accident, this is population reduction.
[00:46:23.464 --> 00:46:31.208]  I mean, this is amazing, and then the big Rockefeller Foundations that own a lot of the big private hospitals and control the cancer industry, they make the money off treating it.
[00:46:31.628 --> 00:46:35.490]  And look, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, I've talked to top cancer doctors.
[00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:40.992]  When they were going to college, they would travel across the country to see a child with cancer.
[00:46:41.073 --> 00:46:42.133]  Now, they're everywhere.
[00:46:42.173 --> 00:46:43.734]  I mean, this is Armageddon.
[00:46:43.794 --> 00:46:45.255]  This is a holocaust.
[00:46:47.015 --> 00:46:47.896]  Yes.
[00:46:48.596 --> 00:46:52.178]  And when you realize the polio epidemic in the first place,
[00:46:52.845 --> 00:47:04.048]  Was probably caused by the introduction of antibiotics in 1942, and they did not want to restrict the antibiotics and pull them off the market, so they pushed for a vaccine.
[00:47:04.308 --> 00:47:11.931]  So we got pushed into this whole thing by corporate money and greed in the first place, and we are now, I mean this is not a political issue.
[00:47:11.971 --> 00:47:19.493]  Democrats don't want their kids to die any more than Republicans do, but we are looking at, in the United States, I mean look around you, like
[00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:24.828]  They're talking maybe 1 in 3 people will have cancer in their lifetime when it used to be like 1 in 10,000?
[00:47:24.868 --> 00:47:32.757]  I mean, this is the biggest mistake in the history of government.
[00:47:33.357 --> 00:47:39.344]  And this is killing more Americans than all wars we've ever been in combined times about 10.
[00:47:42.355 --> 00:47:45.436]  But I guess at the end of the day, they always talk about how there's too many of us.
[00:47:45.476 --> 00:47:49.817]  From your deep research into this, we know this weapon program is going on.
[00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:56.359]  We know now they're coming out with vaccines that counter cancer viruses, but they never want to talk about the elephant in the room.
[00:47:56.739 --> 00:48:01.681]  Then the very cancer virus fighting vaccines end up causing problems and deaths as well.
[00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:12.557]  I mean your best guess estimate did this start as an accident or was it premeditated and clearly they know what's going on today and are covering it up.
[00:48:14.318 --> 00:48:20.102]  I think originally this was kind of the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:22.183]  They found
[00:48:23.428 --> 00:48:40.531]  When they discovered the cancer-causing virus, polyoma, they had already released 100 million doses and they renamed it SV40, but they had 100 million having been released and another 100 million sitting on the shelf.
[00:48:41.091 --> 00:48:53.895]  And from 1959 or so to 1963, they continued to release the next hundred million because they didn't want to stand up in front of the congregation and say, we just inoculated all your children with a cancer-causing virus.
[00:48:54.616 --> 00:48:54.876]  You know?
[00:48:54.896 --> 00:48:57.897]  I mean, there's three kids in my family, the other two have cancer.
[00:48:58.257 --> 00:48:58.537]  Okay?
[00:48:59.997 --> 00:49:00.658]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:00.858 --> 00:49:05.579]  And your father, what did he think of all this?
[00:49:09.525 --> 00:49:13.606]  Well, first of all, my father was not really into the cancer thing very much.
[00:49:13.646 --> 00:49:14.827]  He was an orthopedic surgeon.
[00:49:14.887 --> 00:49:15.547]  He just knew her?
[00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:19.748]  He knew her because they had both come to New Orleans at the same time.
[00:49:19.828 --> 00:49:20.728]  He was from Harvard.
[00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:23.009]  She was from the University of Chicago.
[00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:29.491]  And, of course, because they were both orthopedists, when they would go to their annual conferences and stuff, they would travel together.
[00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:32.772]  And one night, she even came over to the house.
[00:49:32.852 --> 00:49:37.653]  They were entertaining the president of the Royal Academy of Orthopedic Surgeries, and she didn't want to be alone.
[00:49:37.833 --> 00:49:38.233]  The guy.
[00:49:38.674 --> 00:49:42.358]  And so she brought my father along with them and they came back to the house.
[00:49:42.418 --> 00:49:44.480]  So I sat on her lap once as a child.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.462]  I mean, that's how close this woman was.
[00:49:46.742 --> 00:49:50.666]  Could you ever imagine when you started your investigation that it would end there?
[00:49:50.846 --> 00:49:57.473]  A, and B, you talk about how she died, but get into the specifics because that's intriguing in a macabre way.
[00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:09.301]  Well, the public was told that she was found naked, stabbed seven or eight times, and set on fire in the bedroom of her apartment.
[00:50:10.182 --> 00:50:13.546]  They did not tell the public that her right arm was burned off.
[00:50:14.162 --> 00:50:15.324]  Okay, right arm and ribcage.
[00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:19.289]  I mean, the cops on the scene, I have all the documents, the autopsy, police reports, all that stuff.
[00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.835]  The cops on the scene said we could stand there and see her internal organs, okay?
[00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:29.203]  Now this is like not telling the public that Nicole Simpson's throat got cut.
[00:50:29.623 --> 00:50:31.485]  I mean, it's the main fact in the case.
[00:50:32.165 --> 00:50:39.932]  But they didn't want people going around uptown New Orleans looking for a machine that could have burned off Mary Sherman's arm.
[00:50:40.252 --> 00:50:43.515]  Because once you find that machine, which is at the U.S.
[00:50:43.555 --> 00:50:56.486]  Public Health Service Hospital, and all this is happening the day the Warren Commission is doing their investigation into New Orleans, and they got these ID cards on Lee Oswald that came from that document, I mean, came from that facility,
[00:50:57.987 --> 00:50:59.489]  You see the problem?
[00:50:59.549 --> 00:51:00.591]  Why would they want to kill her?
[00:51:02.112 --> 00:51:04.635]  Well, I'm not sure that she was the target.
[00:51:04.876 --> 00:51:08.440]  If they wanted to kill her, they could have stuck a
[00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:11.460]  Gun in their face or an ice pick in their head or something, you know?
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.300]  I mean, there's lots of easier ways to kill people, okay?
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:22.883]  What they wanted to do was to expose the research, the linear particle accelerator, at the U.S.
[00:51:22.923 --> 00:51:23.663]  Public Health Service.
[00:51:23.783 --> 00:51:24.863]  Oh, obviously, yes!
[00:51:24.923 --> 00:51:28.784]  I mean, why leave a woman half burned up in such a dramatic way?
[00:51:29.204 --> 00:51:31.105]  Somebody wanted to lead them back to that.
[00:51:31.645 --> 00:51:35.886]  That's right, because they would have to say, why are you doing this?
[00:51:36.952 --> 00:51:42.484]  And the answer is because we just mass-inoculated the American population with cancer-causing viruses.
[00:51:42.765 --> 00:51:45.691]  Oh, so maybe this was some angry whistleblower then?
[00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:49.355]  Well, who does the trail lead back to?
[00:51:49.415 --> 00:51:54.080]  It's Richard Nixon was in charge of this program that released the vaccine, okay?
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.321]  And he's running for president.
[00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:58.825]  So if you want to take out Richard Nixon, that's a good way to do it.
[00:51:58.845 --> 00:52:08.794]  If you want to show that Oswald's involved in the middle of this, and he's trying to kill Castro, well, so much for a lone nut, and there goes the Warren Commission, and there goes LBJ.
[00:52:09.235 --> 00:52:10.176]  So who's left standing?
[00:52:12.691 --> 00:52:17.399]  Wow, I mean could it have in some way been a good guy or some other bad faction?
[00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:19.823]  It could be either one.
[00:52:20.765 --> 00:52:26.234]  But the point is, if Alt Noshner himself, President of the American Cancer Society, had grabbed that handle,
[00:52:27.012 --> 00:52:28.032]  Instead of Mary Sherman.
[00:52:28.092 --> 00:52:31.553]  She was standing in front of the steel wall and it just blew out her arm like a spark plug.
[00:52:32.034 --> 00:52:35.315]  You know, she was a widow who had no family in town.
[00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:39.016]  They got away with dragging her back to her apartment and faking a sex flashing.
[00:52:39.296 --> 00:52:42.957]  They would have had a really hard time doing that if Alton Hochsner had grabbed the handle.
[00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:43.890]  Okay?
[00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:50.116]  They were trying to get the attention to the linear particle accelerator to bring in the whole issue.
[00:52:50.156 --> 00:52:56.161]  Oh, so she's killed there, and then somebody wanted to cover up, that brought it back to make it look like a slashing.
[00:52:56.682 --> 00:52:57.162]  That's right.
[00:52:57.342 --> 00:53:01.226]  In fact, what happens is, the electricity doesn't cross her heart, okay?
[00:53:01.246 --> 00:53:03.828]  So it blows off her arm, but she's still alive.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:11.602]  So somebody who's with her stabs her very carefully in the heart with a very slim medical instrument to terminate her.
[00:53:11.642 --> 00:53:12.463]  It's a mercy killing.
[00:53:12.803 --> 00:53:18.685]  Then they throw her in a body bag and they take it back to the apartment and they fake a murder scene.
[00:53:19.265 --> 00:53:19.585]  Okay?
[00:53:20.065 --> 00:53:24.367]  And, you know, I've got a memo now and I got this up on my website that
[00:53:26.249 --> 00:53:43.185]  is from J Edgar Hoover about the Mary Sherman murder and he's telling his guys do not investigate this murder under penalty of reprimand and there's a little note on the second page in the name is redacted alright but it says right after saying her arm got burned off says somebody's name was found in her address book
[00:53:44.415 --> 00:53:50.017]  And it's six letters long with an apostrophe S, like O-S-W-A-L-D, okay?
[00:53:50.057 --> 00:53:55.299]  And I got two witnesses that saw Lee Oswald in Mary Sherman's apartment, okay?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.761]  And witnesses who said Mary Sherman telephoned Lee Oswald.
[00:53:59.181 --> 00:54:07.524]  So we've got Lee Oswald wrapped up with this murder that all has to do with this cancer epidemic and the bioweapon.
[00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:13.727]  So can you imagine what Lee would have said if he had gotten into a courtroom in Dallas, alive?
[00:54:15.034 --> 00:54:17.856]  And he even came out and said, hey, I'm a patsy, I'm being shut up.
[00:54:18.877 --> 00:54:30.246]  That's right, and when you read Judith Ferry Baker's book, this Me and Lee book, where she goes, she was with Lee all summer and they're talking on the telephone as the assassination's approaching.
[00:54:30.626 --> 00:54:37.071]  Lee tells her on July 29th, 1963, they're going to kill Kennedy and they're going to blame me.
[00:54:38.932 --> 00:54:39.173]  Wow.
[00:54:40.578 --> 00:54:40.898]  Yeah, I know.
[00:54:40.918 --> 00:54:41.859]  Her story is very incredible.
[00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:43.480]  We need to get her on as well.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:44.160]  You know what?
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:51.905]  You're really at the focal point of so many things that intersect, the key juncture to understand what's happening in our society.
[00:54:52.265 --> 00:55:03.092]  I want to get you back on for a full hour or more to talk about your book, and perhaps you could just send me a list of documents or articles in the order that you think it's best for me to conduct the interview.
[00:55:03.672 --> 00:55:07.554]  So we can really go through all this because there's so many facets to it.
[00:55:07.594 --> 00:55:09.935]  I know the book covers a lot of it, Dr. Mary's Monkeys.
[00:55:10.476 --> 00:55:16.059]  We've had your website up on screen, but what is the best website for folks to visit to learn more about this?
[00:55:16.823 --> 00:55:22.604]  Well, it's Dr. Mary's Monkey, but you spell out the word doctor, D-O-C-T-O-R, okay?
[00:55:22.624 --> 00:55:35.188]  And that's my website, I've got about ten hours of video on it, that Maurice Hilleman video that you were talking about was there, Judith's video is there, Witnesses, other documents, all that stuff.
[00:55:35.428 --> 00:55:37.088]  It's an in-depth thing.
[00:55:37.128 --> 00:55:40.849]  I'm going to have, for the next five days, I'm going to have an Alex Jones special.
[00:55:41.429 --> 00:55:43.951]  I certainly want to get you back on to break all this down because
[00:56:03.146 --> 00:56:07.088]  I mean, I have children, I have a wife, you know, my grandmother, everybody.
[00:56:07.528 --> 00:56:11.069]  And the cancer is up several thousand percent, depending on which type of cancer.
[00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:12.670]  I mean, there's no doubt this is happening.
[00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:15.831]  You've got documents here with them weaponizing it.
[00:56:16.472 --> 00:56:17.612]  And it's so cold-blooded.
[00:56:17.632 --> 00:56:19.453]  We've got to turn this around.
[00:56:19.553 --> 00:56:20.774]  We've got to educate people.
[00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:21.634]  The point you make about
[00:56:23.114 --> 00:56:23.274]  The
[00:56:45.558 --> 00:56:46.500]  You'd have to add it all together.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.466]  Yeah, I figure it's about half of all the cases of cancer.
[00:56:50.486 --> 00:56:54.172]  I mean, the problem is that the SV40 is sexually transmitted.
[00:56:54.858 --> 00:57:05.766]  Okay, so you threw in the birth control pill and the freedom of the 60s and 70s and you got this cross-vector where everybody's getting this SV40 vaccine.
[00:57:05.786 --> 00:57:11.710]  I mean, the Italian studies on it, they found it in the semen of 45% of the otherwise healthy Italian males.
[00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:12.991]  Oh, let's expand on that.
[00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:19.896]  I've seen numbers in India of 97% of the sewage in the countries has it in it.
[00:57:21.377 --> 00:57:22.538]  It's in the air, it's everywhere.
[00:57:22.598 --> 00:57:24.599]  Even if you haven't had the shot, it spreads.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.982]  And it's being transferred from generation to generation.
[00:57:29.022 --> 00:57:35.826]  We're now looking at grandchildren who have it in their blood because their grandmother or grandfather got the...
[00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:57.246]  The vaccine I mean this is really this is a tragedy of biblical proportions and it's going to change the shape of America and the shape of the planet actually and what's going on right now is they're just making money hand over fist you on the chemo
[00:57:58.146 --> 00:57:58.787]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:18.303 --> 00:58:28.486]  And of course you don't even hear these companies coming out saying we've got a vaccine that you know that counters SV40 because even though they could develop one because I guess they don't want to.
[00:58:29.326 --> 00:58:43.269]  Well I think what they tried to do back in 1960 and 61 in New Orleans with the linear particle accelerator was trying to create a mutated form of SV40 that could be used for
[00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:45.230]  A vaccine, okay?
[00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.872]  And I think after a while they finally figured out it was hopeless.
[00:58:48.552 --> 00:58:51.914]  And so that's where that whole thing stands.
[00:58:52.174 --> 00:58:54.236]  Again, it's a tragedy.
[00:58:54.256 --> 00:58:57.918]  And I mean, just ask everybody you know.
[00:58:57.938 --> 00:59:00.840]  Do you know anybody with cancer in your family?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.320]  We're good to go.
[00:59:20.988 --> 00:59:22.869]  I mean, it's just so incredibly common.
[00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:28.932]  Well, Edward T. Haslam, Dr. Mary's Monkey, great job, and I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:32.114]  I'm going to end the news here, but come back and say bye to you off the air.
[00:59:32.154 --> 00:59:33.195]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[00:59:33.595 --> 00:59:34.475]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[00:59:34.936 --> 00:59:42.520]  I want to tell my producers right now, sometime next week, let's get him on for at least an hour and a half, and let's work with him just so he can give us a blueprint with all this knowledge.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.042]  To show the documents and go through it.
[00:59:45.062 --> 00:59:51.607]  Or maybe we should tape a special in here so we have all the documents and really present this to people and try to save some lives.
[00:59:51.647 --> 00:59:55.890]  Because, you know, most of us sitting in this room are going to probably end up getting killed by this.
[00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:58.812]  I mean, if we don't find out a cure for this or something.
[00:59:59.173 --> 01:00:01.254]  I mean, this is just out of control and it's wrong.
[01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:05.938]  And this epidemic's going on and we're not even special people.
[01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:06.799]  We're just sane.
[01:00:07.119 --> 01:00:08.300]  And we're like, my God, look at the numbers.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.381]  We've got to do something about this.
[01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:11.742]  Now, we have this video clip here.
[01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:18.505]  Well, I got an invitation from the Sister Kinney Foundation, you know, which was the opposing foundation, and that was the live virus.
[01:00:18.565 --> 01:00:18.985]  Oh, great.
[01:00:19.005 --> 01:00:21.025]  Yeah, they jumped on Saban's bandwagon.
[01:00:40.984 --> 01:00:46.128]  A man asked me to come down and give a talk at the Sister Kimming Foundation meeting.
[01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:48.730]  And I said, it was an international meeting.
[01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.872]  I thought, God, what am I going to talk about?
[01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:52.793]  I know what I'm going to do.
[01:00:52.813 --> 01:00:57.397]  I'm going to talk about the detection of non-detectable viruses.
[01:00:58.436 --> 01:00:58.996]  As a topic.
[01:00:59.877 --> 01:01:03.178]  So now I gotta have something, you know, that's gonna attract attention.
[01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:06.599]  So I thought, gee, that damn SV-40.
[01:01:06.719 --> 01:01:09.440]  I mean, that damn vacillating agent that we have.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.321]  I'm gonna just pick that particular one.
[01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:15.022]  That virus has got to be in vaccines.
[01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:19.683]  And it's gotta be in Sabin's vaccine, so I quickly untested it.
[01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:22.264]  Sure enough, it was in there.
[01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:23.885]  And we'll be damned.
[01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:30.157]  So now, so I go ahead and... So you just took stocks of Sabin's vaccine off the shelf here at Merck?
[01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:33.078]  Yeah, well it had not been made at Merck, it was made at Merck.
[01:01:33.118 --> 01:01:34.559]  You were making it for Sabin at this point?
[01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:36.220]  Yeah, it was made before I came.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.002]  Yeah, but at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials?
[01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:40.322]  Mm-hmm.
[01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:40.682]  Okay.
[01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:42.403]  In Russia and so forth.
[01:01:42.423 --> 01:01:48.406]  So I go down, I talked about the detection of non-technical virus.
[01:01:48.466 --> 01:01:52.528]  I told Albert... But at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials?
[01:01:52.568 --> 01:01:52.828]  Mm-hmm.
[01:01:53.008 --> 01:01:53.168]  Okay.
[01:01:53.812 --> 01:01:54.932]  In Russia and so forth.
[01:01:54.952 --> 01:02:00.794]  So I go down, I talked about the detection of the non-detectable virus.
[01:02:00.834 --> 01:02:04.255]  And I told Albert, I said, listen, Albert, I said, you know, you and I are good friends.
[01:02:05.216 --> 01:02:08.917]  But I said, I'm going to go down there and you're going to get upset.
[01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:12.038]  I'm going to talk about a virus that's in your vaccine now.
[01:02:13.118 --> 01:02:14.378]  You're going to get rid of the virus.
[01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:15.039]  Don't worry about it.
[01:02:15.059 --> 01:02:16.399]  You're going to get rid of it.
[01:02:16.519 --> 01:02:21.961]  So, of course, Albert was very upset with me.
[01:02:23.402 --> 01:02:24.082]  What did he say?
[01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:31.605]  Well, he said, basically, that this is just another obfuscation that is going to upset the vaccines.
[01:02:31.685 --> 01:02:33.386]  I said, well, you know, you're absolutely right.
[01:02:33.406 --> 01:02:35.727]  But I said, we have a new era here.
[01:02:35.767 --> 01:02:37.488]  We have a new era of detection.
[01:02:37.928 --> 01:02:40.109]  And the important thing is to get rid of these viruses.
[01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:43.931]  Why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was contaminating the vaccines?
[01:02:43.971 --> 01:02:49.593]  Because, well, there were 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we were inactivating.
[01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:54.052]  But you weren't activating the... That's correct.
[01:02:54.132 --> 01:02:54.772]  No, that's right.
[01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:58.535]  But yellow fever vaccine had leukemia virus in it.
[01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:01.898]  You know, this is in the days of very crude science.
[01:03:02.818 --> 01:03:04.360]  So anyway, I went down and talked to him.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.002]  I said, well, why are you concerned about it?
[01:03:07.022 --> 01:03:08.903]  I said, well, I'll tell you what.
[01:03:09.043 --> 01:03:13.407]  I said, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus is different.
[01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:17.169]  I don't know why to tell you this, but I've been around biology a long time.
[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.751]  I just think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[01:03:21.278 --> 01:03:22.139]  And he said, what?
[01:03:22.879 --> 01:03:24.701]  I said, cancer.
[01:03:27.063 --> 01:03:28.164]  I love it.
[01:03:28.224 --> 01:03:28.664]  I love it.
[01:03:28.744 --> 01:03:29.565]  Go ahead.
[01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:31.026]  No.
[01:03:32.347 --> 01:03:37.551]  I said, Albert, I said, you probably think I'm nuts, but I just have that feeling.
[01:03:38.352 --> 01:03:43.136]  Well, in the meantime, we had taken this virus and put it into hamsters.
[01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:45.778]  So,
[01:03:46.664 --> 01:03:57.748]  We had this meeting, and that was sort of the topic of the day, and the jokes that were going around was, gee, we would win the Olympics because the Russians would all be loaded down with tumors.
[01:03:59.868 --> 01:04:01.909]  This is where the vaccine was being tested.
[01:04:01.929 --> 01:04:03.510]  This was, this was tumors.
[01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:04.070]  Right.
[01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.331]  So, and it really destroyed the meeting.
[01:04:08.351 --> 01:04:10.112]  You know, it was a big intervention.
[01:04:10.172 --> 01:04:10.652]  Yeah, right.
[01:04:10.952 --> 01:04:12.492]  So, it was sort of a topic.
[01:04:12.913 --> 01:04:13.093]  Yeah.
[01:04:14.793 --> 01:04:16.074]  Why didn't this get out in the press?
[01:04:16.855 --> 01:04:18.156]  Well, I guess it did.
[01:04:18.256 --> 01:04:18.977]  I don't really know.
[01:04:19.057 --> 01:04:20.998]  I mean, we had no press release.
[01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:22.500]  Obviously, you don't get out.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.963]  This is a scientific affair within the scientific community.
[01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:39.594]  Tested on the Russians, deployed on the American people, and you heard him, 40 plus, from the medical doctors we've had on, they're putting similar stuff in the modern vaccines.
[01:04:41.056 --> 01:04:42.297]  I wish it was an accident.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:52.470]  You heard him joking about how it was a big joke that people were dying from this and the Russians will be so loaded down with tumors we'll beat them at the Olympics.
[01:04:53.151 --> 01:04:56.475]  This was on the big PBS station in Boston.
[01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:58.998]  This is supposedly funny.
[01:04:59.819 --> 01:05:01.481]  This is very hilarious.
[01:05:03.959 --> 01:05:07.660]  This is psychopathic control freaks, a scientific dictatorship who think they're God.
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:13.001]  It's eugenics, just like the current White House science czars to sterilize people with their food and water.
[01:05:13.502 --> 01:05:17.583]  The Rockefeller Foundation documents we've shown you, all of them.
[01:05:17.963 --> 01:05:24.144]  The Planned Parenthood documents we showed you last week, where they said, you know, it's about reducing population.
[01:05:24.785 --> 01:05:33.067]  And even if you believe the population is too high, whatever, jacking people's vaccines full of stuff that gives them a degenerative, horrible death later,
[01:05:34.503 --> 01:05:42.005]  This is the biggest issue, and again, the book is Dr. Mary's monkey that gets into a lot of facets of this, and we're going to continue to cover it from different angles.
[01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:47.346]  We'll do a special coming up in the next few weeks, maybe even get Edward T. Haslam to come here to town.
[01:05:47.366 --> 01:05:53.687]  I know he's come and spoken at some of the local bookstores here in town, and so perhaps we can get him here to town and do a special on that.
[01:05:54.208 --> 01:06:00.189]  Before I end tonight's nightly news, this bifurcated transmission where Rob Newton did the first half and
[01:06:01.368 --> 01:06:02.809]  I'm doing the second half.
[01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:10.456]  We have a report here today that's gone particularly viral, no pun intended, on the drugs report and other major sites.
[01:06:10.496 --> 01:06:14.860]  DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up undocumented ID checkpoint.
[01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:19.645]  And as Duke covered earlier, they've set up checkpoints on highways, they've got the police under their control.
[01:06:20.085 --> 01:06:22.047]  Total Tenth Amendment states rights violation.
[01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:25.470]  Total Fourth and Fifth Amendment with the hands going down the pants.
[01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:31.383]  They've, of course, passed the NDAA, bipartisan support to detain Americans indefinitely.
[01:06:31.423 --> 01:06:37.605]  They're getting ready for the collapse of society into this corporate New World Order fascist structure.
[01:06:38.345 --> 01:06:41.446]  And in this case, it was people going to a Social Security office.
[01:06:41.926 --> 01:06:45.207]  They said, why would you randomly have machine guns and search them and do all this?
[01:06:45.227 --> 01:06:48.768]  And they said, well, it is just a drill, but we're getting ready to do this all over the place.
[01:06:49.149 --> 01:06:52.670]  You can go read the press reports out of the Daily Commercial and others that we link to.
[01:06:53.770 --> 01:07:03.858]  Here other local newspapers, of course, it's not about terrorists the whole Architecture of this is pointed at the general public and now they've dispensed with saying it's for al-qaeda.
[01:07:03.878 --> 01:07:10.442]  They have creepy TSA PSAs showing them at football games and shopping malls, and they're now doing it
[01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:16.340]  So this is about training us for paramilitary-style federal occupation.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:35.752]  Residents of Leesburg, Florida were shocked to see their local Social Security office turned into a random Homeland Security checkpoint Tuesday morning as DHS officers armed with semi-automatic rifles and accompanied by sniffer dogs checked identification of locals with their blue and white SUVs circled around the main office.
[01:07:35.772 --> 01:07:36.653]  They just swarm you.
[01:07:36.913 --> 01:07:39.795]  They just get you used to them running around, you know, line up, we're going to search you.
[01:07:40.737 --> 01:07:41.777]  Right out of Nazi Germany.
[01:07:41.877 --> 01:07:46.118]  At least one official was posted on the door with a semi-automatic rifle, randomly checking identification.
[01:07:47.099 --> 01:07:49.639]  Another officer, some with canines, sniffed through the building.
[01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:50.939]  Reports of daily commercial.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.300]  The activity was part of Operation Shield, an unannounced drill.
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.221]  We have another report here, and then we're basically done here.
[01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:04.743]  TSA behavioral detection officers sentenced for helping drug dealers through security.
[01:08:05.283 --> 01:08:09.304]  Agent ensured marijuana traffickers avoided full body scanners.
[01:08:10.885 --> 01:08:13.206]  This is one of the behavioral detection people.
[01:08:13.746 --> 01:08:22.570]  When I was flying out of Austin a few months ago to be part of Jesse Ventura's TV show, usually the TSA people know who I am and say, hey, we're not all bad.
[01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:23.591]  Can we have your autograph?
[01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:24.691]  This is just a job for us.
[01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:25.772]  We're concerned about the scanners.
[01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:29.453]  Instead, he was one of the supervisors, a bald and gray-haired gentleman.
[01:08:29.493 --> 01:08:31.414]  He said, you, I know you, you're a troublemaker.
[01:08:32.595 --> 01:08:34.175]  And I looked at him and I was like, is that a joke?
[01:08:34.636 --> 01:08:36.396]  And he goes, no, I know who you are seeing on TV.
[01:08:36.477 --> 01:08:37.317]  And I said, okay.
[01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.572]  And he just proceeded to say, where are you going?
[01:08:42.592 --> 01:08:43.052]  What are you doing?
[01:08:43.072 --> 01:08:43.952]  And I said, where I was going.
[01:08:43.972 --> 01:08:45.433]  And he went, oh, Vegas.
[01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:46.253]  Oh, like I was bad.
[01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:47.633]  And I said, yeah, I'm going to do a TV show.
[01:08:48.053 --> 01:08:48.714]  I don't gamble.
[01:08:49.014 --> 01:08:50.074]  He went, oh, yeah, all right.
[01:08:50.134 --> 01:08:53.895]  And he looks to a guy, and he's holding my paper, and he goes, this guy's a troublemaker.
[01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:55.195]  And he looked at me like he was going to scare me.
[01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.256]  And I said, yeah, that's right.
[01:08:57.696 --> 01:08:58.836]  The whole country's collapsing.
[01:08:58.876 --> 01:09:03.217]  Jesse Ventura's suing you guys over the TSA and all the things that are happening.
[01:09:03.257 --> 01:09:05.458]  And this is just nothing but martial law.
[01:09:05.858 --> 01:09:08.419]  And he didn't have that pleasure and that enjoyment anymore.
[01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:12.100]  But he was doing his little behavioral crud, okay?
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.461]  You need to be assessed, okay, as a bunch of control freaks.
[01:09:15.821 --> 01:09:24.303]  Either you're there for just to make the money, as a job, or the supervisors are the people that get off on pushing people around.
[01:09:24.863 --> 01:09:31.365]  We had another report earlier that came out today, also in Florida papers, where top radiology scientists are saying, this will give you cancer.
[01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:33.426]  But flying back from Vegas,
[01:09:34.406 --> 01:09:38.327]  I refuse to go through the scanners and this fellow said, I'm a listener.
[01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:38.827]  I know.
[01:09:38.867 --> 01:09:39.527]  I've heard your show.
[01:09:39.567 --> 01:09:40.547]  You say this is bad.
[01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:43.048]  John Hopkins says it's not bad.
[01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:46.168]  And I said, the head of John Hopkins came out and said there was no such report.
[01:09:46.508 --> 01:09:47.048]  You were lied to.
[01:09:47.068 --> 01:09:47.648]  And he goes, nope.
[01:09:48.088 --> 01:09:48.708]  I have the facts.
[01:09:48.728 --> 01:09:49.489]  They gave us the facts.
[01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:54.489]  And I said, sir, it was in like the Wall Street Journal that the head of it said they never came to us to study.
[01:09:54.529 --> 01:09:55.270]  This will give you cancer.
[01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:56.830]  And he said, no, it doesn't.
[01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:58.470]  It gives me one one billionth of cell phone.
[01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.330]  And I said, sir, that is not true.
[01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:02.911]  And I said, I care about your health.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.401]  And he just laughed at me.
[01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:06.822]  I was like, man, whoa.
[01:10:07.022 --> 01:10:09.284]  I mean, it's just delusion.
[01:10:10.265 --> 01:10:14.588]  Not having the Bill of Rights and Constitution, not having any checks and balances, this is dangerous.
[01:10:14.608 --> 01:10:15.929]  And we told you it's going to get worse.
[01:10:16.589 --> 01:10:19.672]  I mean, hell, mega banks can steal tens of trillions now and not get in trouble.
[01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:22.474]  MF Global can take all that money and not get in trouble.
[01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:24.916]  And Corzine's caught lying in Congress doesn't get in trouble.
[01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:29.599]  Thousands of people went to jail for the savings and loan.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.943]  And I've talked to the head regulator on that, Professor Black,
[01:10:35.455 --> 01:10:37.878]  William K. Black, and now no one's gotten in trouble.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.864]  I mean, Bernie Madoff was a piker compared to what these people are doing.
[01:10:42.924 --> 01:10:43.785]  We're in trouble.
[01:10:44.246 --> 01:10:47.289]  That's what tyranny is, is when criminals take over your society.
[01:10:48.746 --> 01:10:49.926]  They want to teach you to bow.
[01:10:49.986 --> 01:10:51.567]  They want to teach you that they're the master.
[01:10:51.587 --> 01:10:53.508]  That when they raise their hand, you flinch and get scared.
[01:10:53.788 --> 01:10:55.808]  They want to try to break your will and cow you.
[01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:58.789]  I think it's going to backfire, and I do see it backfiring.
[01:10:59.109 --> 01:11:00.690]  Alright, powerful transmission.
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:06.472]  It is up to you to realize how powerful this information is, to research it and help get it out to your friends and family.
[01:11:06.952 --> 01:11:11.333]  I want to thank PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers, because without you, we wouldn't be able to do this.
[01:11:11.453 --> 01:11:14.094]  We then, a day or so after you see it first here,
[01:11:14.734 --> 01:11:18.556]  And archived at PrisonPlanet.TV with all the films and the rest of the nine years of material.
[01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:20.558]  We do post it for others for free.
[01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.699]  We even pay to have crew do that.
[01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.361]  So we pay to give stuff away free because we know there's no future if we don't do that.
[01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:34.226]  But it's you that finance us by being PrisonPlanet.TV members that make all this possible and the crew and all of your supporters out there.
[01:11:34.546 --> 01:11:35.507]  So thank you so much.
[01:11:35.947 --> 01:11:37.308]  This is incredibly important work.
[01:11:37.868 --> 01:11:38.449]  Anytime
[01:11:39.289 --> 01:11:42.771]  I get a little paranoid about the government coming after me or whatever, as they have a few times before.
[01:11:42.791 --> 01:11:44.251]  I realize it doesn't matter.
[01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:46.492]  They're injecting us with cancer viruses knowingly.
[01:11:46.512 --> 01:11:48.373]  I mean, there's no... Afraid?
[01:11:48.393 --> 01:11:49.313]  They're already killing us.
[01:11:49.433 --> 01:11:50.494]  They're already soft-killing us.
[01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:54.495]  There's no... There's no way out of this but fighting back, and that starts with speaking up.
[01:11:55.156 --> 01:11:57.557]  So, we got a 15-day free trial of your viewer out there.
[01:11:58.137 --> 01:12:00.818]  4prisonplanet.tv, and you're watching this online somewhere.
[01:12:01.218 --> 01:12:04.059]  Send it on to your friends and family in an email, on Facebook, Twitter.
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.781]  This video, dealing with a cancer...
[01:12:07.962 --> 01:12:09.536]  In the vaccines and how important that is.
