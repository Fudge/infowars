[00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.072]  Okay.
[00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.230]  Good evening, and welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.595]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, and today's date is Monday, August 13, 2012, and here's a look at what we have coming up.
[00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.408]  Tonight, the stability of U.S.
[00:00:55.508 --> 00:01:07.614]  banks and the safety of individual deposit accounts in grave danger, as former money manager Ann Barnhart says the marketplace is destroyed and it's time to get your money out.
[00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:12.277]  Meanwhile, something strange appears to be happening all over the globe.
[00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:18.600]  As government and big banks are acting as if they are anticipating an imminent financial collapse.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.643]  Plus fears that federal authorities are preparing for mass civil unrest have increased.
[00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:30.686]  After it was revealed that the Department of Homeland Security is planning to buy 750 million rounds of ammo.
[00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:39.389]  This in addition to the 450 million rounds of hollow point bullets already purchased earlier this year.
[00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.930]  Then, this is what your tap water looks like.
[00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.713]  Natural Society's Anthony Gucciardi joins us to reveal the true condition of our polluted water supply.
[00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:52.334]  But wait, there is a remedy.
[00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:56.235]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.196]  Alright, we got quite a show for you.
[00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.758]  Let's kick it off with the DHS.
[00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.922]  Now they're buying, looks like over a billion bullets.
[00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:15.184]  Here's the headline from InfoWars.
[00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:20.187]  DHS to purchase another 750 million rounds of ammo.
[00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:24.090]  Second ammunition by this year fuels massive civil unrest.
[00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:39.680]  Fears that federal authorities are preparing for mass civil unrest have increased after it was revealed that the Department of Homeland Security is planning to buy 750 rounds of ammo in addition to the 450 million rounds of hollow point bullets already purchased earlier this year.
[00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:41.473]  Wow, isn't that great?
[00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.576]  Well, the total ammo purchase, there's a PDF file we're going to show you in a second.
[00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:50.559]  It's got the total ammo purchase exceeding 750 million rounds.
[00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:59.025]  That is four bullets for every man, woman, and child in the United States.
[00:02:59.105 --> 00:02:59.866]  And there it is.
[00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:01.307]  There's our four bullets.
[00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.928]  And they're hollow point, of course, because
[00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:08.804]  You know, you use Holopoint when you really care to send that message to that special someone out there.
[00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:10.485]  This is really disturbing.
[00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:14.747]  You know, there's speculation of two different reasons why they're buying this.
[00:03:14.887 --> 00:03:21.750]  One, they're either going to use it on us, or two, they're buying it up so we can't use it to protect ourselves in the event of a major collapse.
[00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:25.092]  Because nobody's going to go out there and go to war with DHS.
[00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:30.535]  But we do have the right to defend ourselves, and we do have the right to defend ourselves from an unjust government.
[00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:49.650]  And that 750 million rounds points to the there's the PDF we have over on the screen right there you can see and that's linked in the article you can see all the different versions of that before that and March 28th Business Insider reported the Department of Homeland Security is buying 450 million new bullets and these are
[00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:54.536]  Let's see, what does it say here?
[00:03:54.796 --> 00:04:02.458]  The .223's caliber and exactly the same round used by NATO forces, the 5.56x45mm.
[00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:15.862]  So there's that article there, and the USDA is buying ammo, everybody's making million round purchases of ammo, it's just not passe to get 100,000 bullets for target practice.
[00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:17.362]  Now we've got to buy millions of rounds.
[00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:18.962]  And why is that going to happen?
[00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:21.023]  Well, leads us to our next article.
[00:04:21.756 --> 00:04:26.738]  Are the government and big banks quietly preparing for an imminent financial collapse?
[00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.399]  Okay.
[00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.060]  And this is a source from Reuters.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.841]  Something really strange appears to be happening all over the globe.
[00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:40.084]  Governments and big banks are acting as if they are anticipating an imminent financial collapse.
[00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:44.365]  And that's from the Economic Collapse blog.
[00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.046]  There it is right there.
[00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.051]  And they source Reuters.
[00:04:48.252 --> 00:04:48.472]  U.S.
[00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:57.280]  regulators directed five of the country's biggest banks, including Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs, to develop plans to stave off of collapse if they fear serious problems.
[00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.385]  Emphasizing the banks cannot count on government help, like they did last time.
[00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:10.133]  The two-year program, which has largely been secret until now, is in addition to the living wills, which we reported a few weeks ago, the banks have crafted to help
[00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:12.946]  Regulators dismantle them if they actually do fail.
[00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:21.331]  It shows how regulators are working to ensure that banks have plans for the worst-case scenarios and connect rationally in times of distress.
[00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.674]  Does this seem odd to anyone else that only the big banks get a warning?
[00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:28.035]  That seems odd to me.
[00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.256]  And why keep it secret from the American public?
[00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.357]  This is stuff that has to be fished out of
[00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:33.447]  We're good.
[00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.810]  There's an interesting little quiet, please, which we have.
[00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:49.953]  Loose talk can cost lives, because that's what's going to happen.
[00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:50.994]  People are starting to talk.
[00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:55.298]  We've got IRS whistleblowers that we've had on the show.
[00:05:55.318 --> 00:06:00.923]  We're talking about how the whole system is basically fraudulent, and it's set up to fail.
[00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:06.628]  But, you know, the big guys up top are not going to get, they're not going to have any problems.
[00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:07.289]  They've already
[00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:11.828]  They've built their redoubts, they've got their food, it's just going to be bad.
[00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:20.189]  So the SHTF plan has, and we posted this today, warning, get your money out, all legal bank deposit protections are officially gone.
[00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:27.150]  And this goes back to 2011 when there is former money manager Ann Barnhart.
[00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:35.872]  She ceased operating her brokerage firm and returned funds to her customers citing systemic problems within the entire financial industry.
[00:06:36.992 --> 00:06:41.914]  And she issued a new warning about the stability of banks and the safety of individual deposits.
[00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:43.394]  Well, what happened last year, 2011?
[00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:49.177]  Remember, that's when Gerald Solente was getting on talking about Corzine stealing his money?
[00:06:49.197 --> 00:06:52.258]  And, uh, well, that's what happened.
[00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:54.859]  This goes back even before Solente.
[00:06:56.491 --> 00:07:03.693]  This comes from a recent appeals court ruling surrounding customer funds lost during a 2007 collapse of Chicago futures broker Sentinel.
[00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:19.918]  Indicates that individuals who lose deposit funds because financial institution improperly manages that money, even if those funds are supposed to be segregated, which means they're not supposed to be invested by the company, from other operations of the firm, they're simply left with no recourse if the firm goes belly up.
[00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:20.858]  And that was according to the court.
[00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:22.264]  Here it is.
[00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:31.151]  A miscalculation of customer funds is not on its own sufficient to rule as a matter of law that Sentinel acted without intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its customers.
[00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:35.855]  So basically what they're doing is legalizing the theft of your money.
[00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:39.598]  And even if it's in a segregated account, they get to use it however they want.
[00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:40.599]  They get to squander it.
[00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.640]  They get to bet with it.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.082]  And if they lose it, it ain't no problem.
[00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:50.927]  And that's why Ann Barnhart left the industry putting out that call to her investors and giving them their money back.
[00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:54.411]  And Mark Slavo ends with this,
[00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:11.736]  And that's it.
[00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:14.318]  I mean, that's why DHS is buying all these bullets.
[00:08:14.358 --> 00:08:19.600]  Because when people realize that the system is fake and that it has collapsed, there's going to be a lot of riots.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.201]  That's why they're buying all that riot gear.
[00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.682]  The Army is even buying it now.
[00:08:24.082 --> 00:08:29.205]  They're getting ready for everything to implode, for people to be out in the streets demanding answers.
[00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:33.026]  And when the riots start, people are going to be asking for the Army.
[00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:37.809]  We've already seen signs in Detroit of people spray-painting on the walls, where's the 20,000 troops in Detroit?
[00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:41.930]  People are going to be calling for this stuff because it's going to be so bad.
[00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:46.072]  And, you know, what's another symptom of this?
[00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:51.934]  Well, our government's filled with, you know, these giant pedophile rings.
[00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:54.915]  So let's move on to Penn State and Petty Valley.
[00:08:55.415 --> 00:08:56.515]  This is from the Mail Online.
[00:08:56.555 --> 00:09:03.158]  Jerry Sandusky and major Penn State donor abuse two boys aboard a private plane, claims a new witness.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:04.960]  There it is.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.282]  A man has come forward alleging he saw Jerry Sandusky and a prominent Penn State official sexually abusing two boys together aboard a private plane.
[00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:19.344]  The FBI is taking the accusation seriously and they're going to do an investigation.
[00:09:19.884 --> 00:09:21.465]  So what does all this mean?
[00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.006]  Well, several things.
[00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:31.558]  They had a quick trial in order to cover up any of this stuff, because it was reported a long time ago.
[00:09:31.698 --> 00:09:35.539]  In fact, back in November of 2011, rumors.
[00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:38.860]  Sandusky pimped out young boys to rich donors.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.001]  There it is, from CBS Chicago.
[00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:47.622]  And that was based on a tip that Mark Madden, a sports writer for 105.9 in Pittsburgh,
[00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:55.758]  Uh, was talking about on a couple radio shows that he had him talk, you know, he was talking about this stuff.
[00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:57.518]  He says it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:12.905]  The one thing I hear being investigated right now, and I hasten to add this is only a rumor, but I know of at least two prominent columnists who are investigating the story, and that is the second, uh, and that is at Second Mile, and there's no nice way to say this, pimped out young boys to wealthy donors.
[00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:15.816]  There's really no nice way to say that.
[00:10:15.956 --> 00:10:18.498]  They were bringing in wealthy donors and pimping them out.
[00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:23.642]  And this was all, you know, when Sandusky left back in the 90s.
[00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.104]  He was 55 years old.
[00:10:25.144 --> 00:10:27.546]  This is a guy who was pretty much in his coaching prime.
[00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:28.847]  So Madden
[00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:33.683]  Back around that same time was Sandusky a state secret.
[00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:37.205]  I think it's called Madden Rewind, Sandusky a state secret.
[00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:43.047]  And as the Beaver County Times columnist reported that the Jerry Sandusky thing, it just doesn't add up.
[00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:46.649]  That now, you know, they've had all these allegations.
[00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:48.030]  He suddenly disappears.
[00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.490]  He doesn't go coach anywhere else.
[00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:52.492]  Well, he was talking about that it was a cover-up back then.
[00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:58.935]  Well, and then it comes out that there's this rumor of him pimping out young boys to rich donors.
[00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:06.547]  None of which was in the Washington Post report that talked about the Louis Freeh investigation where they bring in Louis Freeh.
[00:11:07.047 --> 00:11:11.871]  He says, well, basically it was a few people in Penn State knew about it.
[00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:13.872]  It was Sandusky just acting alone.
[00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:14.693]  Let's move on.
[00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:17.475]  So Paterno is fired.
[00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:18.035]  He dies.
[00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:23.019]  Graham Spanier is fired from Penn State as the president.
[00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:24.240]  But what does he get?
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.583]  Well, he gets a major, cushy new job with an unknown government agency.
[00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:33.646]  In fact, his job is so secret, we can't even tell you who he's working with.
[00:11:34.247 --> 00:11:35.167]  So there's the article there.
[00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:38.970]  Graham Spanier's gig as a federal worker is a big mystery.
[00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:50.218]  Graham Spanier might have been ousted from his post at the helm of Penn State over the sex abuse scandal that engulfed the university, but it now seems he's found a backup employer, the American taxpayer.
[00:11:51.543 --> 00:11:58.424]  And his lawyer confirms to The Loop that Spanier is working as a part-time consulting basis for a top-secret agency on national security issues.
[00:11:58.464 --> 00:12:02.825]  But the gig is so hush-hush, he couldn't even tell his attorneys the name of the agency.
[00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:14.588]  In April, months after his ouster as president, but before the release of the internal report, which is the free report, he told Patriot News of Central Pennsylvania he is working on a special project for the U.S.
[00:12:14.628 --> 00:12:16.308]  government relating to national security.
[00:12:17.368 --> 00:12:20.869]  Could it be how to cover up pedophilia rings at your university?
[00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:22.954]  Are large institutions even?
[00:12:22.994 --> 00:12:23.494]  Who knows?
[00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:28.455]  That seems like what it could be for me because he was fired for that very same reason.
[00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:32.377]  So, moving on to other matters.
[00:12:32.637 --> 00:12:37.199]  In the article, YouTube threatens to terminate account over criticism of copyright policy.
[00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:38.479]  That's from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:46.742]  That came out today and it basically kind of explains this saga that we've been going through with YouTube for a while.
[00:12:47.382 --> 00:12:49.503]  I don't know if you've seen the movie Endgame.
[00:12:50.524 --> 00:12:51.024]  Great film.
[00:12:51.084 --> 00:13:10.351]  There's a lot of filmmakers that we interview now that claim this is the thing that really woke them up and that they got a lot of their information from, especially in the eugenics angle, because it goes deep into eugenics, in addition to NAFTA and the international superhighway going through the United States, but a big section on eugenics and what's going on.
[00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:13.352]  And I think they go to Bilderberg in Canada up in
[00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:18.659]  Well, so what happened is there's a company called, it's right here, Biotronic.
[00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:20.281]  It's a musical group, Biotronic.
[00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:25.125]  They took some excerpts of Endgame and put into one of their songs.
[00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:27.868]  And then there's robots out there that go out and find this
[00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:30.702]  You know, that sample.
[00:13:30.742 --> 00:13:33.243]  And if they find it, they say, oh wait, you don't own this copyright.
[00:13:33.263 --> 00:13:33.704]  So here it is.
[00:13:33.744 --> 00:13:45.371]  In the case, because Alex Jones' voice was used on the track recorded by the musical group Biotronic, YouTube copyright bots erroneously identified Jones' voice in his own documentary, Endgame, as being owned by Biotronic.
[00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:53.697]  The result was a penalty being placed against the original user's account with an additional threat of termination if any further penalties were issued.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.144]  So what this is, is these bots go out there, they find this stuff, they immediately start flagging things.
[00:14:00.724 --> 00:14:06.888]  And if you don't have all your ducks in a row and are ready to fight it, or say you're out on vacation and then you get another couple things, boom, your account could be gone.
[00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:09.830]  And that was on ChangeTheChannel's account.
[00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:18.316]  He had Endgame posted up there for free for people to watch because we want to get the information out there, but if you do want to support us, pick up a copy of Endgame and see what all the fuss is about.
[00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.634]  So what happens is Alex has a video explaining that.
[00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:27.437]  He put out a video explaining how YouTube bots are going out there censoring people.
[00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:33.761]  Well that was taken down by YouTube and they say they're claiming the clip was commercially deceptive.
[00:14:34.022 --> 00:14:34.382]  There's the
[00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:41.574]  The screens there, and those are also in the article, and you could read about all that in the article.
[00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:45.798]  Robot Hijacks In-Game Film was the video that was taken down.
[00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:48.239]  So now we're going to go to Alex, who's going to explain everything.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:58.768]  It's about 10 minutes long, but it'll give you a lot of insight into how these systems kind of behind the scenes work, which is a reason why, let me stress this, this is a reason why
[00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:00.739]  You need to hard copy stuff.
[00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.344]  Do you notice how computers don't have disk drives anymore?
[00:15:03.364 --> 00:15:06.730]  Do you notice how they talk about cloud computing and how it's great?
[00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:08.152]  No, it's not great.
[00:15:08.172 --> 00:15:09.214]  You know what cloud computing is?
[00:15:09.535 --> 00:15:11.138]  Cloud computing is the memory hole.
[00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:12.801]  Because if they don't want something out there,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.521]  Boom, it's gone.
[00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:16.663]  That's why everybody needs hard copies.
[00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:22.609]  You need to print out articles on paper and save them because you go back, these articles are gone.
[00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:24.651]  That's why you need DVDs.
[00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:27.674]  Get one DVD, make a bunch of copies, give it out to people.
[00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:31.638]  Or download these videos and put them on a DVD.
[00:15:31.718 --> 00:15:37.624]  Have them where even if your computer is destroyed, you can get another computer and you can put these on that system.
[00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:40.606]  Well, this may be the end of our main YouTube channel.
[00:16:06.636 --> 00:16:10.220]  That has 226 million views and growing exponentially.
[00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:27.619]  But we'll still have prisonplanet.tv and the syndicated radio show and you'll still be able to download our interviews and news and everybody from you know Willie Nelson to you name it to Congressman Ron Paul that comes on the show but we're not deemed worthy enough to even have a partner channel with YouTube.
[00:16:30.026 --> 00:16:34.768]  You know, because I have cover stories in Rolling Stone and Newark Magazine and Nightline.
[00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.249]  We're just not worthy.
[00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.712]  And I've been operating this channel now for about four years, and they've tried to shut it down hundreds of different ways.
[00:16:42.932 --> 00:16:45.414]  Shot a drone over the highway in Austin this week.
[00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:53.138]  Just a lot of interesting stuff on there, but they have put a strike against the channel, and under this new system, it won't be there long.
[00:16:54.338 --> 00:16:59.221]  And of course, with the new cybersecurity internet ID that Obama says he's going to sign an executive order for,
[00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:06.157]  All they have to do is give you three strikes and then you're basically banned from the web itself.
[00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.559]  And it tracks you and taxes you.
[00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.420]  It's all being announced, just look it up.
[00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.182]  What am I getting at here?
[00:17:13.363 --> 00:17:25.812]  Well, in the last year our channel has been plagued and almost shut down because, well you remember, you remember Joe Rogan.
[00:17:28.263 --> 00:17:38.835]  My friend of many years, all the interviews I've done with him, a group called VentPixel had put in a software system so that his performances couldn't be copied.
[00:17:39.015 --> 00:17:39.996]  Which I think is reasonable.
[00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:42.539]  But the computers don't work that way.
[00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:47.985]  And they wouldn't use VentPixel's program that's specific to the actual words or performance.
[00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:51.757]  But to the voice generally, YouTube makes them use that tool.
[00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:58.839]  So I had BitPixel contact YouTube, go through a bunch of hoops to get our channel back in good standing.
[00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:00.780]  They've taken away our long uploads and things.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.842]  Because what they do is they put their ads over it, but we've had it before where just because somebody puts their ads over it, if you don't challenge it,
[00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:08.983]  Later it kicks in and removes the channel.
[00:18:09.263 --> 00:18:10.304]  You've seen that happen before.
[00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:11.984]  But not BentPixels' fault.
[00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:16.066]  They had to stop monetizing Joe Rogan because they'd already had problems with this.
[00:18:16.647 --> 00:18:22.590]  In fact, they'd already asked YouTube months before to stop doing it, and YouTube just didn't quit.
[00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.510]  So, what has YouTube now done?
[00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.893]  You know about Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:31.574]  It's not even on my channel.
[00:18:33.117 --> 00:18:36.739]  The particular version, it's on Change the Channel, it's got hundreds of millions of views.
[00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:42.421]  Our version had a couple million views on that channel, and he called us.
[00:18:44.502 --> 00:18:57.427]  The fellow that runs the channel, who we know well, Mr. Webb, called us a few weeks ago, and he said, yeah, I'm in bad standing, they've put this on me, they're putting ads over it, they're saying they own your voice, this record company.
[00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:01.549]  So, we put out a video called Robot Hijacks Endgame.
[00:19:03.712 --> 00:19:07.196]  Now, we didn't even say that company was doing it on purpose.
[00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:09.858]  We said, we're sure it's YouTube's robot.
[00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:14.903]  Because somebody at this record company sampled my voice in one of the songs.
[00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:15.904]  Fine!
[00:19:16.285 --> 00:19:17.486]  My stuff's Creative Commons.
[00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:26.475]  Well, now they've given us a community guidelines, uh, spam, scams, and commercially deceptive.
[00:19:27.614 --> 00:19:28.795]  Really commercially deceptive.
[00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:37.323]  A film I made that sold in stores that I'm advertising for free on someone else's channel making zero from and guess what?
[00:19:37.623 --> 00:19:41.707]  They've removed their ads from it and removed the copyright claim.
[00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:45.631]  If you go to Endgame
[00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:51.602]  You'll notice that before it had all the ads right here.
[00:19:52.082 --> 00:19:57.584]  You can go watch my video on it from yesterday that they've banned, but there's copies of it.
[00:19:57.604 --> 00:20:00.325]  I'm going to show you one of them in a minute and see that all that's gone.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:03.907]  And I saw the official record company
[00:20:04.927 --> 00:20:06.767]  They're saying, hey, Alex is right.
[00:20:07.288 --> 00:20:08.568]  We did not mean for this to happen.
[00:20:08.948 --> 00:20:10.868]  The YouTube robot isn't operating properly.
[00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:12.169]  So it is a robot.
[00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:13.069]  I'm blaming the robot.
[00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:16.129]  This is a big deal that they can just say your voice is owned.
[00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:17.690]  And it's happening to more and more people.
[00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.690]  I talked to the Bent Pixel folks.
[00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.850]  They said it's a big issue.
[00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.031]  They can't even monetize YouTube because of this.
[00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:27.172]  I'm all for people's music and stuff or specific comedy performances to be protected.
[00:20:27.212 --> 00:20:27.712]  This isn't.
[00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:30.893]  You think I liked having to get Joe Rogan to make phone calls?
[00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:32.393]  You think I like bugging him?
[00:20:34.966 --> 00:20:37.207]  So it goes on here, they're saying sue the bastards.
[00:20:38.388 --> 00:20:39.828]  It's got people saying the Bionic.
[00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:42.349]  I bet Bionic flagged this video on the AJ channel.
[00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.990]  Anyone can flag any video.
[00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:53.154]  Well, Bionic is the name of the particular label, but then it's another company over it.
[00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:54.595]  But they've gotten it fixed.
[00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:56.456]  They got it removed.
[00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:58.337]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:20:59.468 --> 00:21:03.831]  Now, they may completely take the channel down now just because we showed you what's happening.
[00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:05.192]  We're not supposed to do that, I guess.
[00:21:06.253 --> 00:21:12.517]  That YouTube is saying we're frauds, we're scammers, and they say they agree with this.
[00:21:13.237 --> 00:21:22.464]  Well, you can still go here and watch the video that's been restricted, or banned, blocked, because somebody made a copy of it for now, and you can see my evil.
[00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:26.947]  And then you can notice
[00:21:29.744 --> 00:21:30.104]  We're good.
[00:21:46.616 --> 00:21:48.918]  Which again, used to, we'd leave this kind of stuff up.
[00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:50.399]  It's Bionic.
[00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:55.442]  But we found, yeah, it's Bionic Projects, the artist, and then the record company.
[00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.204]  It's all, it was listed right there.
[00:21:57.224 --> 00:21:58.765]  And it's pretty good techno music.
[00:21:58.805 --> 00:22:00.306]  I mean, pretty darn good, actually.
[00:22:00.326 --> 00:22:06.610]  You know, Google, Amazon, eMusic, a bunch of other links right there.
[00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.071]  Let me show you.
[00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:12.695]  Again, this is saved here, even though they tried to erase it.
[00:22:14.013 --> 00:22:14.293]  Okay.
[00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:18.617]  So the point is, is that the record company got it fixed.
[00:22:19.758 --> 00:22:21.240]  I have been proven correct.
[00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:31.469]  And in response, they have now taken the video down and put an official strike on us.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.883]  You get one more than another, that's it, and they're constantly filing fake ones.
[00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:39.364]  We're constantly having to deal with this.
[00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:55.116]  So folks, all the videos, here's the bottom line, all the videos, all the incredible things like Food, The Ultimate Secret, and all the analysis we've done on GMO and the poisons and the wars and Al Qaeda working for the Pentagon, and all the incredible interviews.
[00:22:56.157 --> 00:23:00.621]  Whatever is most important to you, you better go into our thousands of videos on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:03.300]  And get those out of there.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.502]  And at least save them before they burn our library to the ground.
[00:23:06.842 --> 00:23:08.383]  And they've shut the channel down before.
[00:23:08.403 --> 00:23:12.966]  I've had to file, you know, papers and stuff where I swear in court and all this stuff.
[00:23:13.006 --> 00:23:13.647]  I mean, believe me.
[00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:17.209]  But it's... This is an outreach for the general public.
[00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.991]  Folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:24.054]  I was driving... I mean, sure, I'm on XM-166 and over 115 radio stations.
[00:23:24.094 --> 00:23:26.836]  But that's a great crowd, but they're mainly older and conservative.
[00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:29.252]  I want to reach everybody.
[00:23:29.332 --> 00:23:30.653]  I just... I mean, look at this.
[00:23:30.673 --> 00:23:32.695]  Max Keiser, we're in a financial holocaust.
[00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:34.956]  Getting into the big bags, preparing for collapse.
[00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.237]  I mean, this is just so big.
[00:23:37.418 --> 00:23:40.300]  There's our article, Roadbot hijacks in-game video flagged.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.862]  All it is is just showing that it's happened.
[00:23:41.982 --> 00:23:43.303]  They'll probably shut us down for that.
[00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:45.244]  How dare us point out that we were right.
[00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:47.246]  You know, we didn't engage in any fraud.
[00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:52.509]  I mean, you don't own my voice, and YouTube is mad.
[00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.311]  This is the final bottom line.
[00:23:56.204 --> 00:24:16.921]  YouTube is mad because they're using ham-fisted robot tools that will go in and block stuff that is not the copyright they're claiming and somebody had to go in and fix this this weekend and so they just said well we'll just put a strike on Alex Jones and again people said we'll just leave YouTube if you don't like them they're over half the video views in the world
[00:24:18.274 --> 00:24:20.196]  They advertise as a Creative Commons.
[00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:21.598]  It's YouTube.
[00:24:21.698 --> 00:24:22.639]  We bring the value.
[00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:24.741]  I'm an award-winning filmmaker.
[00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:29.006]  I put my films on here for free, like Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, all of them.
[00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:32.750]  Seen tens of millions of times apiece.
[00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.872]  I'm bringing the value.
[00:24:35.553 --> 00:24:35.873]  Okay?
[00:24:35.913 --> 00:24:36.614]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:24:36.654 --> 00:24:40.218]  I don't even monetize my channel with the little ads on the bottom.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.820]  It's disgusting.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.741]  So you better see it all before they knock it out.
[00:24:46.781 --> 00:24:51.662]  Brothers in Arms, drones shot down over Texas, Bob Chapman, all his interviews, all these incredible things.
[00:24:52.223 --> 00:24:53.303]  They want to ban them right now.
[00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:59.645]  And I guess I'm not supposed to say contact YouTube to write this, because I guess that's a scam.
[00:25:00.085 --> 00:25:04.086]  Standing up against the fraud of saying that I don't own my voice.
[00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:10.808]  So they have restored that video to not having a claim against it.
[00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:14.640]  Which I've seen them kick into full strikes before, so we're trying to get it removed.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.481]  But giving us a strike.
[00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:18.402]  Please help us.
[00:25:18.882 --> 00:25:22.644]  You can always listen to the audio at InfoWars.com and the podcast for now and stuff.
[00:25:23.484 --> 00:25:27.166]  And I guess that's just the answer, is that we do need to start uploading our stuff to other channels.
[00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:28.287]  People do.
[00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:29.968]  Daily Motion and a bunch of others.
[00:25:30.982 --> 00:25:31.462]  Vemo.
[00:25:32.143 --> 00:25:34.625]  But they're starting to censor those too.
[00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:36.206]  They don't want you seeing this information.
[00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:41.431]  Alright, Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:43.773]  There's a 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:45.774]  You know, we have to charge there a little bit.
[00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:46.635]  People pay for the bandwidth.
[00:25:46.675 --> 00:25:48.016]  We try to give it to you free right here.
[00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:49.617]  But PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:52.898 --> 00:25:57.421]  So like I said, get your hard copies ready, because we're going to need them.
[00:25:57.481 --> 00:25:58.781]  That's why we're printing out a newspaper.
[00:25:58.821 --> 00:25:59.762]  It's coming out next month.
[00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:02.844]  You know, if you can't hit yourself in the head with it, it's not a hard copy.
[00:26:03.184 --> 00:26:03.484]  Okay?
[00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:04.885]  Get it on disc.
[00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:06.385]  Get it in paper.
[00:26:06.806 --> 00:26:12.709]  And get ready, because when it comes down, you're going to wish you had this stuff.
[00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:16.131]  Let's move on to the Paul Ryan Distraction.
[00:26:17.046 --> 00:26:19.649]  And this is out of the New American Veep.
[00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.633]  Paul Ryan is no conservative.
[00:26:23.253 --> 00:26:24.194]  And we know he's not.
[00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:27.178]  He's just one of these guys who plays along with the rules.
[00:26:27.238 --> 00:26:28.199]  He was a neocon.
[00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:29.060]  He loves wars.
[00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:30.421]  You know, it's funny.
[00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:32.143]  Before we go to this quote here.
[00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:37.089]  In his little budget that he made, everybody was like, oh, the Ryan budget's so great.
[00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:39.804]  You know what he didn't lower?
[00:26:39.824 --> 00:26:41.066]  It was military spending.
[00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.587]  He increased military spending.
[00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.609]  And it wasn't defense spending.
[00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:50.295]  It's going into more countries and ruining more people's lives spending and putting us more into debt spending.
[00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:51.717]  That's what kind of spending it was.
[00:26:51.737 --> 00:26:56.202]  It has nothing to do with saving democracy or protecting us from Al-Qaeda or any of that bull.
[00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:57.783]  That's what it's about.
[00:26:58.524 --> 00:26:59.705]  So anyway, let's go back to the article.
[00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:16.452]  Ryan voted for all the big-ticket, budget-busting items of the administration of George W. Bush, including No Child Left Behind Act, the Prescription Drug Benefit Act, known as Medicare Part D, often described as the large expansion of the welfare state since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
[00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:20.994]  He voted to create the Department of Homeland Security, including the TSA.
[00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:30.285]  That has harassed air travelers, making aircraft safe from shoes, belt buckles, and grandma's knitting needles, in addition to colostomy bags and, well, breasts.
[00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:37.869]  He voted for the Patriot Act, giving government enhanced powers for warrantless snooping of Americans' lives, as well as for nationals.
[00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:49.275]  He voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP as we know it, for the too-big-to-fail financial institutions, and inspired the Tea Party Rebellion against big government and crony capitalism.
[00:27:49.315 --> 00:27:51.196]  He also backed the GM
[00:27:52.082 --> 00:27:55.246]  Take over, as we now know as Government Motors.
[00:27:57.327 --> 00:28:00.269]  I found this great picture on Adam vs. the Man's site.
[00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:01.190]  Let's go to that right now.
[00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.690]  There it is.
[00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:17.022]  Paul Ryan voted for TARP, the auto bailouts, Medicare expansion, housing subsidies, employment extension, a national ID, the making the Patriot Act permanent, surveillance without a warrant, no child left behind, keeping the troops in Iraq indefinitely, and the 2008 and 2009 stimulus.
[00:28:17.282 --> 00:28:18.363]  Sounds perfect for Romney.
[00:28:18.443 --> 00:28:20.584]  So, yeah, actually I think it's a great pick for Romney.
[00:28:20.904 --> 00:28:25.628]  But while all you Tea Partiers are out there going, oh boy, Paul Ryan, look at his real voting record.
[00:28:26.048 --> 00:28:33.010]  Look at his actions, don't listen to his words, because he's another big government crony, just like Romney, and they're not going to be a solution.
[00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.890]  And so, don't vote for Obama, don't vote for Romney.
[00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.251]  I'm not voting for either one of them.
[00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:43.432]  If I vote for anybody, it'd be for Gary Johnson, but I'm not even planning on voting, because it's not going to make a difference.
[00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:54.274]  They've already decided which World Wrestling Federation contestant they're going to put into the system, because the owner owns both teams, just like he does in the World Wrestling Federation.
[00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:56.584]  Which brings us to our quote of the day.
[00:28:56.604 --> 00:29:04.266]  Another big government guy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said, In politics, nothing happens by accident.
[00:29:04.346 --> 00:29:07.047]  If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.
[00:29:07.988 --> 00:29:12.749]  32nd President of the United States and First Honorary Grand Master of the Order of De Molay.
[00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.910]  So there's your quote of the day.
[00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.132]  We'll be right back with a few more articles and our interview with Anthony Gucciardi of Natural Society.
[00:29:19.492 --> 00:29:20.112]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:51.474]  I really enjoy it when the globalists try to poison us, and well, we resist them via a free market system.
[00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:59.318]  Hello my fellow info warriors, Alex Jones here, introducing you to the pro-pure family of gravity-fed filters.
[00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:06.723]  Now, you know that the globalists are filling our water with radioactive isotopes, fluoride, lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:30:07.423 --> 00:30:16.787]  And one of the few systems that can efficiently and economically remove or reduce down to non-detectable levels these poisons are gravity-fed filters.
[00:30:17.207 --> 00:30:19.489]  And ProPure is the top of the line.
[00:30:19.989 --> 00:30:24.531]  Their filters are impregnated with silver, a natural antibiotic,
[00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:28.597]  On top of that, they're bigger so they filter faster.
[00:30:28.897 --> 00:30:32.002]  You don't have to prime these the first time you use them.
[00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:33.044]  It's amazing!
[00:30:33.084 --> 00:30:38.873]  Go to Infowars.com and click on the shopping cart link to see the entire family of these babies.
[00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:44.887]  Now, the fluoride they add to our water is so tiny that most filters can't cut it out.
[00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:51.111]  But ProPure has their system that will, again, reduce it to non-detectable levels.
[00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:53.112]  Almost get all of it out of there.
[00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:54.413]  That's also available.
[00:30:54.733 --> 00:31:06.700]  And if you look at the different systems they offer, the ProPure Big Brush Finish is on a stand, so it's easier on a table or at your restaurant or wherever you have it to go up with a glass or a mug and fill it up.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.882]  Then there's this big baby right here, the Pro-Pure King, large version.
[00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.223]  Got a lot of different options that come with it.
[00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:17.885]  Also, they have the Pro-Pure Big, probably one of the best values out there.
[00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:20.146]  And of course, it's burnished stainless steel.
[00:31:20.526 --> 00:31:27.910]  And then, what I use on my RV, something that's great for your hunting cabin or the back porch, is the Pro-Pure Traveler.
[00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.635]  Small and portable but packs a huge punch, cleans out all that garbage.
[00:31:34.015 --> 00:31:40.721]  They also have a glass sight spigot so you don't have to take the top off and look in the bottom area to see how much water.
[00:31:40.761 --> 00:31:43.244]  You can see how fast it's filtering with this optional
[00:31:44.425 --> 00:31:47.308]  The globalists obviously are hitting us through our water.
[00:31:47.608 --> 00:31:49.310]  It's time to take control of our lives.
[00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.773]  It's time to not give our children and families these poisons.
[00:31:52.993 --> 00:31:57.458]  And these systems cut it down to non-detectable levels across the board.
[00:31:57.818 --> 00:32:00.060]  ProPure is the name.
[00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:02.583]  I only promote what I believe in.
[00:32:03.203 --> 00:32:06.747]  And I use ProPure in my home and my office.
[00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:11.332]  And I recommend that you check out the information on ProPure at Infowars.com.
[00:32:11.552 --> 00:32:17.758]  We already have the lowest price at Infowars.com on the ProPure gravity filter system.
[00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:26.527]  But when you add in the 10% off when InfoWarriors use the product code WATER at InfoWars.com, nobody can top it.
[00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:28.289]  So again, it's a win-win-win.
[00:32:28.349 --> 00:32:37.018]  Stop drinking the poison water, checkmate the globalists when it comes to your health, and support InfoWars.com and the work we're doing here.
[00:32:37.358 --> 00:32:41.661]  You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things and kidnap people for funds.
[00:32:42.061 --> 00:32:46.645]  We promote in the free market the products we use that are about preparedness.
[00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:53.850]  That's how we fund this revolution against the New World Order in our move to restore our constitutional republic.
[00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.151]  And a spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[00:32:57.551 --> 00:32:59.192]  Check it out at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:59.592 --> 00:33:00.212]  ProPure.
[00:33:00.693 --> 00:33:01.613]  Top of the line.
[00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:02.833]  Number one.
[00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:08.256]  Most powerful and effective and economical gravity-fed water system in the world.
[00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:09.156]  ProPure.
[00:33:09.476 --> 00:33:12.277]  Available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:12.537 --> 00:33:14.758]  Don't forget product code WATER to save 10%.
[00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:17.099]  It's the latest generation.
[00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.600]  Years in development.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.221]  ProPure is the name.
[00:33:22.469 --> 00:33:27.616]  I really enjoy it when the globalists try to poison- Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:33:27.896 --> 00:33:32.743]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:33:32.923 --> 00:33:40.133]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:33:40.253 --> 00:33:45.677]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:33:45.898 --> 00:33:49.661]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:54.505]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:33:54.685 --> 00:33:59.929]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:03.291]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:05.693]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:34:05.953 --> 00:34:10.577]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:34:10.717 --> 00:34:13.179]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:20.684]  Everything we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[00:34:20.864 --> 00:34:21.905]  We're getting prepared.
[00:34:22.145 --> 00:34:22.565]  Are you?
[00:34:22.806 --> 00:34:24.187]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:34:30.504 --> 00:34:35.168]  Welcome back to InfoWars Nightly News, the most hard-hitting show on the internet right now, telling you like it is.
[00:34:35.188 --> 00:34:36.149]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:37.931]  Let's move on, we've got a couple more stories.
[00:34:39.031 --> 00:34:39.292]  U.S.
[00:34:39.312 --> 00:34:45.417]  super soldiers of the future will be genetically modified transhumans capable of superhuman feats.
[00:34:46.138 --> 00:34:46.338]  Wow.
[00:34:47.594 --> 00:34:54.636]  Tomorrow's soldiers could be able to run at Olympic speeds and will be able to go for days without food or sleep if new research into gene manipulation is successful.
[00:34:55.117 --> 00:34:55.817]  According to the U.S.
[00:34:55.877 --> 00:35:04.680]  Army, plans for the future soldiers will be able to carry huge weights, live off their fats stored for extended periods, and even regrow limbs blown apart by bombs.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:13.326]  The plans were revealed by novelist Simon Conway, who was granted behind-the-scenes access into the Pentagon's high-tech Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[00:35:13.346 --> 00:35:14.707]  You know what that stands for?
[00:35:14.787 --> 00:35:15.267]  DARPA.
[00:35:15.728 --> 00:35:17.929]  And DARPA means, not good for the rest of us.
[00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:26.636]  Most gene manipulation techniques involve placing genetically modified DNA inside a virus and injecting it into the human body.
[00:35:27.156 --> 00:35:33.801]  The virus then enters human cells and modifies the DNA and attaches itself to the human DNA inside those cells.
[00:35:35.094 --> 00:35:37.515]  When you stop and think about it, the implications are definitely staggering.
[00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:42.536]  So you're going to have these super soldiers walking around who definitely are going to feel superior to the rest of us.
[00:35:43.456 --> 00:35:45.797]  And what happens when they do feel superior to the rest of us?
[00:35:45.817 --> 00:35:46.637]  Are they going to take over?
[00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:47.457]  Well, no.
[00:35:47.537 --> 00:35:54.539]  They've also got giant robots that are going to be ready to kill whoever stands in their way, including these superhumans.
[00:35:54.579 --> 00:35:55.959]  So they will stand in line.
[00:35:55.979 --> 00:36:01.680]  These guys will be basically kind of like a really kick-butt Delta Force.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.661]  You know, these guys are going to be superhuman.
[00:36:03.681 --> 00:36:04.581]  They'll be able to jump.
[00:36:05.188 --> 00:36:06.168]  You know, you've seen the G.I.
[00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:09.669]  Joe movie where the guy was in the super suit and able to fly across buildings and stuff.
[00:36:09.689 --> 00:36:12.149]  It's going to be like that, but they won't be in super suits.
[00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:16.270]  They'll just be in regular fatigues.
[00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.550]  Surely, to be scary.
[00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:23.211]  We're going to talk a little bit about some transhumanism stuff with Anthony Gucciardi coming up.
[00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:33.533]  Next, I want to go to a video that Alex Jones and Aaron Dyke shot, and this has to do with yongevity and the transformation that Aaron Dyke's made going into
[00:36:34.733 --> 00:36:40.719]  A fairly large individual into a slim, trim guy that you see lately on the nightly news.
[00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:41.719]  He's not here this week.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.242]  He's actually off on a much well-deserved vacation.
[00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:48.245]  But I've known Aaron since early 2009.
[00:36:48.766 --> 00:36:50.808]  And he was a big guy.
[00:36:50.848 --> 00:36:52.930]  It wasn't that he was out of shape.
[00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:53.490]  He walked.
[00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.211]  He ate right.
[00:36:54.251 --> 00:36:55.352]  He was trying to do these things.
[00:36:55.392 --> 00:36:57.394]  But until he started taking the mineral supplements,
[00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.431]  He didn't start seeing the changes.
[00:36:59.471 --> 00:37:00.895]  So here's that video.
[00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:04.304]  And when we come back, I'm going to show you some really gross things that are in your water.
[00:37:04.344 --> 00:37:05.226]  So stay tuned.
[00:37:05.246 --> 00:37:05.728]  Here's that video.
[00:37:09.033 --> 00:37:13.574]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[00:37:13.974 --> 00:37:18.896]  If we want to defeat the globalists, we have to understand they're using medical tyranny against us.
[00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:23.797]  But to get us into that globalist-controlled system, they want to make us unhealthy.
[00:37:23.897 --> 00:37:32.379]  The globalists spike our water with sodium fluoride, and they admit it causes massive increases in bone cancer, brain damage, and reduced IQs.
[00:37:32.759 --> 00:37:35.280]  The GMO crops have all been directly linked.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.962]  ...to reduce fertility, deformities in mammals across the board.
[00:37:40.923 --> 00:37:45.585]  The globalists in these school lunch programs feed children absolute garbage.
[00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:49.887]  Fast food is full of chemical additives, things like silicone.
[00:37:50.811 --> 00:38:04.022]  We're all under attack because when we're operating from a healthy position of good food, natural food, clean water, and the nutrients and trace elements we need, our minds will be on fire.
[00:38:04.443 --> 00:38:08.246]  The powerful, creative human destiny will be unleashed.
[00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:10.167]  I want to tell you a very important story.
[00:38:11.008 --> 00:38:19.857]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn from friends like Ted Anderson about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:25.963]  And I started promoting him some because I'd seen his weight loss, his health, all the things that happened for him.
[00:38:26.644 --> 00:38:32.767]  And by the way, things like Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus are not even advertised for weight loss.
[00:38:33.168 --> 00:38:46.495]  It's just that when you take it, you are getting the minerals and vitamins you need from an original plant form, and so you're full because the main crops that are grown on these debilitated, played-out soils
[00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:59.861]  Are not giving you the minerals and vitamins you need so you eat and you eat and you eat and get raw calories that pack on weight and that burn out your different glands and cause things like diabetes.
[00:39:00.241 --> 00:39:04.863]  When you finally start getting the minerals and vitamins and trace elements you need, it is incredible.
[00:39:05.224 --> 00:39:09.786]  Now I've only stuck my toe in the water and lost a little over 40 pounds and I'm still big.
[00:39:10.786 --> 00:39:18.008]  Aaron Dykes, who you know has been working here for six years at InfoWars.com, lost 92 pounds.
[00:39:18.028 --> 00:39:19.869]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:23.030]  He began to hear the guest on my show a year and a half ago.
[00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:31.092]  He began to do his own research, and he implemented the information that Longevity and InfoWarsTeam.com is promoting.
[00:39:31.972 --> 00:39:34.013]  And had dramatic results.
[00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:45.399]  And that's why I'm telling our listeners and viewers, you need to go to infowarsteam.com and try just the essential fatty acids, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, and the Polym Burst Plus.
[00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:50.742]  And I believe you'll be blown away by the dramatic results that I've had and Aaron's had.
[00:39:50.762 --> 00:39:52.883]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[00:39:52.923 --> 00:39:53.443]  Your story.
[00:39:53.763 --> 00:39:56.346]  I've been overweight in my life for far too long.
[00:39:56.706 --> 00:40:01.070]  Years ago, I lost a lot of weight, more than 50 pounds, but it came right back.
[00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.231]  I wasn't able to keep it off.
[00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:08.717]  More recently, I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[00:40:08.777 --> 00:40:12.841]  It just didn't happen, and I wasn't able to stay motivated long enough to reach my goals.
[00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:19.407]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com and the great products, Tangy Tangerine, kind of the base one to start with.
[00:40:19.807 --> 00:40:23.611]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:24.592]  I wanted that nutrition.
[00:40:24.612 --> 00:40:30.137]  Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:36.223]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[00:40:36.323 --> 00:40:38.225]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[00:40:38.425 --> 00:40:39.506]  Yes, they don't.
[00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:44.231]  But pharmacist Ben Fuchs explains that's what happens if you're overweight because you're no longer hungry because you're getting what you need.
[00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:47.574]  It was a perfect storm because it was giving my body the nutrients it needs.
[00:40:47.614 --> 00:40:56.023]  It gave my body the things it needs to seek out first, which made me not have to crave after other things that I don't need that don't even provide nutrition.
[00:40:56.263 --> 00:41:00.066]  And what's crazy is this is not advertised as weight loss.
[00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.127]  The company never even promoted it.
[00:41:02.528 --> 00:41:05.350]  We just discovered it's the ultimate weight loss tool.
[00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:11.895]  Not only is it incredible that the Infowarsteam.com products were hidden in plain view, but that there's no teleprompters here.
[00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:16.458]  You know, Aaron, you wanted to endorse these products because everybody on air has seen the amazing transformation.
[00:41:16.678 --> 00:41:20.021]  They've seen me lose quite a bit of weight, but I haven't totally committed to it like you have.
[00:41:21.056 --> 00:41:24.940]  And we're here just telling people the effects that it's had for us.
[00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:32.108]  And by the way, just a week and a half ago, I said, you know what, I want to lose the next 40 pounds, because doctors have told me I need to lose 80 pounds.
[00:41:32.568 --> 00:41:33.329]  I have a hernia.
[00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.152]  It's not a hyenal hernia.
[00:41:36.412 --> 00:41:37.413]  It's in my belly button.
[00:41:37.914 --> 00:41:41.117]  And they told me, they said, you need to lose about 80 pounds, you'll have to have surgery.
[00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:42.765]  And I've lost 40.
[00:41:43.405 --> 00:41:45.106]  I need to go the rest of the way.
[00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:47.507]  So a week and a half ago, I said, you know what?
[00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:51.508]  I'm not used to just taking pills all day, taking vitamins all day, drinking drinks all day.
[00:41:51.788 --> 00:41:55.850]  Yeah, I do one tangy tangerine, one polymers today, a couple of essential fatty acids.
[00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.570]  Not now.
[00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.451]  I'm doing the whole regimen.
[00:41:59.131 --> 00:42:02.393]  And I've lost seven pounds in a week and a half.
[00:42:02.693 --> 00:42:09.897]  I'd lost 42, I quit doing it because I've never been in the habit of doing this, gained a few pounds back, and now raced seven pounds in a week and a half.
[00:42:10.137 --> 00:42:14.219]  We're going to see what happens here with Alex Jones, folks, because I'm fully committing.
[00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:15.259]  I'm taking it all.
[00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:16.360]  I'm doing it.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.023]  Now, breaking this down, it's not just the weight loss.
[00:42:19.123 --> 00:42:20.304]  It's also energy.
[00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:21.746]  It's so many other things.
[00:42:21.766 --> 00:42:22.066]  Aaron?
[00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:23.068]  It's like this, Alex.
[00:42:23.128 --> 00:42:24.590]  Our world's become centralized.
[00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:33.340]  The people who have taken over the food supply have tried to give us fillers so they can go for, you know, the greatest number of people being fed these junk foods and everything else.
[00:42:33.721 --> 00:42:35.363]  When you take this nutrition
[00:42:35.723 --> 00:42:42.909]  You're giving your body the little codes, the little fats, the little signals it needs, and when the body gets that, it responds to it right away.
[00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:43.970]  That's why it works.
[00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:52.877]  It's really just feeding it in the formula you need, so then you're not seeking out food you don't really need, and it makes things like emotional eating a lot less likely as well.
[00:42:53.517 --> 00:42:57.840]  And I found pizza cravings and things like that went away when I took the essential fats.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:05.965]  When I had the tangy tangerine, you have that base nutrition, so you're not always looking for nutrition in foods where you're really not going to find it anyway in many cases.
[00:43:06.405 --> 00:43:19.053]  I think organic foods and stuff like that's really important as well, but this was a total transformation when I was already eating organic foods, already trying to work out and already trying to change my life, but this really let it happen.
[00:43:19.393 --> 00:43:20.114]  When people
[00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:22.095]  Actually try this.
[00:43:22.595 --> 00:43:23.416]  They are blown away.
[00:43:23.456 --> 00:43:31.221]  When they find out that when you start taking their proprietary formulation of essential fatty acids, it blows the competition away.
[00:43:31.601 --> 00:43:39.246]  When you start taking Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus and the other key longevity products, it is incredible.
[00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:42.108]  But you've got to continue taking it.
[00:43:42.629 --> 00:43:47.512]  But the body is so starved for nutrition, by design, by the globalist,
[00:43:48.353 --> 00:43:57.020]  I mean, they've engineered this so that we become these self-propelled stomachs always seeking food because we're looking for the vitamins, the minerals, the trace elements.
[00:43:57.381 --> 00:43:59.903]  This has the mighty 90 in it.
[00:44:00.223 --> 00:44:07.369]  The human body needs 90 vitamins, minerals, and trace elements to work in fusion together.
[00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:09.171]  And the system knows this.
[00:44:09.491 --> 00:44:13.274]  So I challenge you, check out the incredible products at infowarsteam.com.
[00:44:14.595 --> 00:44:18.177]  Use them, and if you don't see incredible effects, I will be shocked.
[00:44:18.417 --> 00:44:22.639]  Because everyone I talk to who has used these is sold on them.
[00:44:22.899 --> 00:44:24.640]  You've seen the effects on Alex Jones.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.801]  You've seen the effects on Aaron Dykes.
[00:44:27.241 --> 00:44:30.943]  The system knows about high nutrient diets.
[00:44:31.283 --> 00:44:41.788]  They've done studies where mice and other rodents can live twice as long, or even longer in some cases, when they're given super high nutrient diets.
[00:44:42.668 --> 00:44:45.850]  But it is not available in most of the foods out there.
[00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:53.374]  We've actually been lied to for decades in our lives, maybe our whole lifetimes for a lot of people, because we're told to eat a certain way.
[00:44:53.454 --> 00:44:57.176]  We're convinced by television and other advertisements of how to live our life.
[00:44:57.276 --> 00:44:58.476]  It's all wrong.
[00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:02.238]  And when you just read about the nutrition, you realize how powerful it is.
[00:45:02.478 --> 00:45:04.019]  You realize this is what we're meant to take.
[00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:07.841]  That's the stuff you find in tangy tangerine and longevity products.
[00:45:07.961 --> 00:45:08.982]  And it was so easy.
[00:45:09.562 --> 00:45:10.743]  That's the most incredible part.
[00:45:10.783 --> 00:45:17.087]  It was so easy to lose weight and regain health for myself, barely without trying, just from taking the products.
[00:45:17.327 --> 00:45:22.190]  We're here promoting what we believe in, what we've seen great results with, to you.
[00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:39.202]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and watch this video so you can see for yourselves the incredible results Aaron and others have achieved with Longevity products that are discounted at wholesale prices at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:45:39.882 --> 00:45:45.966]  Again, sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:45:46.607 --> 00:45:50.289]  The revolution against tyranny starts individually with our bodies.
[00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.611]  There is a global awakening happening.
[00:45:52.971 --> 00:45:56.033]  The sleeping giant that is humanity is awakening.
[00:45:56.293 --> 00:45:59.415]  And a big part of that fight starts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:46:07.836 --> 00:46:09.098]  So I hope you learned a little bit from that.
[00:46:09.158 --> 00:46:13.203]  Hopefully it gives you some inspiration out there to make those changes that you need to make in your life.
[00:46:13.424 --> 00:46:16.287]  And I tell you what, I'm on the Ingevity program.
[00:46:16.588 --> 00:46:20.753]  I dropped 25 pounds in about a month, and I've kept it off.
[00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:21.374]  I used to be about 225, 230.
[00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:21.775]  I'm now down to 203.
[00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:25.549]  I've been down to 198.
[00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:26.889]  It was my lowest.
[00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:31.270]  And I wasn't an overweight person, but I was definitely getting to be unhealthy.
[00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.711]  I do drink an occasional beer every now and then.
[00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:38.412]  So, by taking those mineral supplements, you know, I'm able to not eat as much.
[00:46:38.432 --> 00:46:40.892]  Therefore, I save money on my food bill.
[00:46:40.912 --> 00:46:42.972]  I only eat, like, one big meal a day.
[00:46:43.773 --> 00:46:45.413]  And the rest of the time, it's just mineral supplements.
[00:46:45.473 --> 00:46:46.233]  And I don't get hungry.
[00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:48.793]  So, take that for what you will.
[00:46:49.133 --> 00:46:49.674]  Let's move on.
[00:46:49.694 --> 00:46:51.634]  You ever want to know what's in your tap water?
[00:46:52.659 --> 00:46:54.140]  Especially after it sits around for a while.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:02.984]  Well, Anthony Gucciardi of Natural Society made a short 45 or 48 second video called, This is What Your Tap Water Looks Like.
[00:47:03.384 --> 00:47:11.847]  In the video above, I show you the overflow tray of my 12-stage water filtration device that collects the excess amount of gunk that the filters discharge.
[00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:17.210]  The extra amount is the buildup amount from 12 different stages of water filtration, and it's disturbingly putrid.
[00:47:21.526 --> 00:47:26.669]  And cheap bitter filters don't grab that much from the water, or brittle-like filters that you're drinking.
[00:47:26.709 --> 00:47:33.932]  It virtually allows 100% of the fluoride and other heavy metals to pass right through, which is why you should definitely get into filtering your water.
[00:47:34.172 --> 00:47:35.893]  Let's go to that video, and then we're going to talk to Anthony.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.503]  Hi, this is Anthony Gucciardi, and it's very rare that you actually get to see what tap water looks like.
[00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:46.006]  In this instance, I'm showing you the contamination of the tap water and the after effects.
[00:47:46.486 --> 00:47:51.250]  What you're seeing right now is the overflow tray from my personal water filtration device.
[00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.713]  It's a 12-stage system, and the gunk in there is basically contamination.
[00:47:56.813 --> 00:48:06.740]  Heavy metals, pesticides, chemicals, drug residue, urine, fecal matter, dirt, dust, the works in there.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:07.461]  I think?
[00:48:24.963 --> 00:48:34.828]  And with more on the disgusting filth that was trapped at the bottom of the overflow tray, we go to Anthony Gucciardi of NaturalSociety.com.
[00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:36.729]  And Anthony, how are you doing today?
[00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.490]  Great.
[00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.970]  How about you?
[00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.150]  I'm doing great.
[00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.532]  I was pretty grossed out by your video.
[00:48:41.872 --> 00:48:42.572]  So tell us about that.
[00:48:42.632 --> 00:48:44.433]  How long was that water sitting there?
[00:48:44.493 --> 00:48:47.475]  Was that like a year's worth of collection, or six months, or what was that?
[00:48:48.015 --> 00:48:50.417]  Actually, believe it or not, it was just a little bit over a month.
[00:48:50.477 --> 00:48:52.058]  About three days over a month.
[00:48:52.098 --> 00:48:55.900]  And the recommended time you should change the filter is about one month.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.383]  If you see in the video, there's a little warning label, and that actually says change monthly.
[00:49:00.863 --> 00:49:04.465]  So that's just three days over the rate you're supposed to change it.
[00:49:04.505 --> 00:49:05.226]  Imagine a year.
[00:49:05.386 --> 00:49:06.426]  It would be overflowing.
[00:49:07.107 --> 00:49:10.469]  The reason I actually had to take it out is because it was overflowing.
[00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:16.972]  I was having a leak problem because of the just residue and filth clogging up the water flow.
[00:49:17.092 --> 00:49:21.315]  There's a little hole in the middle, and if the water can't get in, it'll overflow.
[00:49:21.735 --> 00:49:23.976]  So that's what caused me to take it out in the first place.
[00:49:24.817 --> 00:49:31.720]  And so you pulled that out, you were disgusted by it, you made a 48 second video, shot it, threw it up on YouTube, and now it's got over 30,000 hits.
[00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:33.876]  Exactly.
[00:49:33.896 --> 00:49:41.738]  Yeah, I wanted to do some type of special show on or something like that, just explain to people, but it was just so disgusting.
[00:49:41.758 --> 00:49:44.139]  I didn't even want to toy with anyone.
[00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:46.139]  I didn't want to bring it up to the studio or anything like that.
[00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:48.320]  I just had to go get the camera and do a quick little shot.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.880]  I had no idea also that it would blow up.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.241]  I just really wanted to show people what they're putting into their bodies.
[00:49:53.621 --> 00:50:00.343]  And to my knowledge, there's nothing really like that to such an extent to show people literally what they're drinking and what's going on in their body.
[00:50:00.825 --> 00:50:02.126]  Right, and that's all diluted.
[00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.629]  That's stuff that actually gets taken out of the filtering process.
[00:50:04.889 --> 00:50:06.251]  We have it up on screen right now.
[00:50:06.651 --> 00:50:13.218]  So you can see you have this dark black residue, you have some white residue, you have some colored orange residue.
[00:50:13.238 --> 00:50:19.184]  I mean, you know, tell us, what do you think is making up all of the stuff in that tray?
[00:50:20.365 --> 00:50:22.606]  Well, what's interesting is we really don't have to guess too much.
[00:50:22.726 --> 00:50:28.127]  I mean, we know for a fact that it's fluoride in there, different heavy metals, mercury in many cases.
[00:50:28.548 --> 00:50:33.429]  Just in Philadelphia alone, which is where I'm located right now, there's one parts per million fluoride in the water.
[00:50:34.049 --> 00:50:39.951]  And then we have fecal matter, antibiotics, that's one main source of antibiotic resistant bugs and everything.
[00:50:40.051 --> 00:50:40.411]  I think so.
[00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:04.521]  Right.
[00:51:04.741 --> 00:51:08.423]  It's a host system of it, and that's what's going to grow in there.
[00:51:08.883 --> 00:51:11.284]  It was really disturbing to see that, and that was only one month.
[00:51:11.304 --> 00:51:16.666]  So just imagine what six months of that is, and imagine that's the stuff you're putting into your body when you don't filter it.
[00:51:17.026 --> 00:51:18.306]  So talk a little bit.
[00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:20.887]  You said you're also going to do another experiment.
[00:51:21.528 --> 00:51:24.489]  Talk a little bit about the experiments you want to do, just to illustrate this to people.
[00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:31.711]  Yeah, so basically to give you a rundown of what filter I'm using, it's supposed to be an atmospheric water generator.
[00:51:32.231 --> 00:51:36.893]  It actually takes water from the air and filters it through a 12-stage filtration process.
[00:51:37.313 --> 00:51:40.694]  And the water you get from the air is actually distinctly different than tap water.
[00:51:40.734 --> 00:51:48.296]  And part of the reason I went to tap water, besides low humidity rates around here at the time, is I wanted to do this experiment to see the difference.
[00:51:48.677 --> 00:51:49.777]  And in the past, I had
[00:51:49.997 --> 00:51:51.639]  I really had no idea it would get this bad.
[00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:54.222]  I had to, like I said, take it out, but I've never had to do that before.
[00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:56.704]  When you take it from the air, it's actually much cleaner.
[00:51:56.724 --> 00:52:00.468]  I'm going to do a video on the difference between the air and I might actually put the camera...
[00:52:01.471 --> 00:52:03.433]  In front of the Ecola Blue, which is what I use.
[00:52:04.553 --> 00:52:06.095]  No financial affiliation, by the way.
[00:52:06.595 --> 00:52:15.782]  And put it in front of the camera, literally for 30 days, and just do like a 10-minute video that shows I did not alter it next to a clock, you know, to prove that I'm not messing around.
[00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:16.782]  It's not a lie.
[00:52:16.803 --> 00:52:17.463]  It's not a fluke.
[00:52:17.803 --> 00:52:19.825]  And take out the tray and notice the difference on each one.
[00:52:20.663 --> 00:52:22.944]  Well, it's a shame that you would have to go to those lengths.
[00:52:23.004 --> 00:52:25.384]  I mean, obviously, you pulled your overflow tray out.
[00:52:25.664 --> 00:52:26.725]  That's the gunk you saw.
[00:52:26.925 --> 00:52:28.185]  You decided to make a video of it.
[00:52:28.405 --> 00:52:33.227]  And you also said you ran a few tests on that with some heavy metal strips.
[00:52:33.247 --> 00:52:35.147]  And what happened there with those tests?
[00:52:35.547 --> 00:52:37.668]  Well, you can purchase any heavy metal strip for about...
[00:52:38.828 --> 00:52:39.269]  $20 online.
[00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.549]  Global Healing Center is where I get it.
[00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:41.450]  Good friend, Dr. Guru.
[00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:46.512]  But I purchased these and I ran the tests and it's just overwhelmingly positive.
[00:52:46.812 --> 00:52:48.973]  But to me, that's not really much of a surprise.
[00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:52.815]  I think it's pretty much well known that there's a massive amount of heavy metals in the water.
[00:52:54.156 --> 00:53:00.078]  But also just think about the fact that, I mean, the difference in what we're drinking is amazing.
[00:53:00.419 --> 00:53:03.280]  The tap water is so polluted to have to do that.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.962]  And some people are telling me I mashed up meatballs and put it in there.
[00:53:08.003 --> 00:53:08.624]  That's absurd.
[00:53:08.664 --> 00:53:09.446]  It's a joke, yeah.
[00:53:09.847 --> 00:53:10.187]  Come on.
[00:53:10.227 --> 00:53:12.031]  I mean, there is such a thing as integrity.
[00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:14.276]  Tell us about Natural Society.
[00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:15.539]  How long have you been running that site?
[00:53:15.619 --> 00:53:17.663]  Because we've been publishing your articles for a while now.
[00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.810]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.311]  Just about a bit over a year.
[00:53:20.431 --> 00:53:33.482]  What was happening was I was writing for a number of different websites, including InfoWars, and I still do, I submit stuff all the time, but what happened was I was writing for so many different sites, I decided to compile the information into one platform, and that's where Natural Society came about.
[00:53:33.842 --> 00:53:40.208]  It's essentially a platform for different writers and everyone to come together and talk about what works, what doesn't work, and the latest news, everything like that.
[00:53:40.808 --> 00:53:41.528]  Well, that's good.
[00:53:41.608 --> 00:53:49.032]  That's the best way to get information around for humans as ourselves to be talking to one another, communicating, showing people what works and what doesn't work.
[00:53:49.352 --> 00:53:51.193]  We don't need the government babysitting for us.
[00:53:51.213 --> 00:53:54.775]  We can obviously see what government water gets us.
[00:53:54.935 --> 00:53:58.097]  You know, after a month you get all this crud and nasty stuff.
[00:53:58.517 --> 00:54:03.502]  One thing I've done is I just recently got one of these bad boys.
[00:54:03.562 --> 00:54:04.763]  It's a Pro-Pure system.
[00:54:05.423 --> 00:54:06.284]  There it is right there.
[00:54:06.304 --> 00:54:15.032]  I got, actually I think I did get this size, the king size with the filter elements up top which have silver in them.
[00:54:15.772 --> 00:54:18.955]  Plus, you know, charcoal and all the other things, and then I got the fluoride reduction elements.
[00:54:19.536 --> 00:54:24.761]  I upgraded from my last system because the last system didn't come with those fluoride reduction elements.
[00:54:25.001 --> 00:54:25.982]  That's absolutely key.
[00:54:26.122 --> 00:54:26.963]  You know, that is key.
[00:54:27.003 --> 00:54:28.344]  I mean, that is key.
[00:54:28.364 --> 00:54:33.790]  And it brings me to my next point, which is, and this is one of your articles, too, we published at the end of July.
[00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.634]  Majored Harvard study published in Federal Government Journal confirms, confirms
[00:54:39.355 --> 00:54:40.575]  Fluoride lowers IQ.
[00:54:40.615 --> 00:54:42.896]  I mean, what do these people at Harvard know that we don't know?
[00:54:43.076 --> 00:54:49.179]  Or, I guess we already knew that, but... Well, what we do know is there's been 28 previous studies to show that fluoride lowers IQ.
[00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:54.441]  Before this one, this is really just the icing on top of the evil cake, essentially.
[00:54:54.941 --> 00:55:03.184]  And they found that, quote, the children in high fluoride areas, which is really not that high, had significantly lower IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas.
[00:55:03.624 --> 00:55:09.625]  Now, some people were telling me, though, oh, this only applies to third world nations because they have fluoride spikes and, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:09.805 --> 00:55:10.245]  But here's one.
[00:55:10.305 --> 00:55:21.668]  It says, even at low levels, such as one part per million, which is the standard for United States drinking water, especially here in Philadelphia, they try and get the average to be one part per million.
[00:55:21.788 --> 00:55:23.528]  And it often goes up much higher.
[00:55:23.568 --> 00:55:26.989]  I've had reports of seven parts per million, 12 parts per million, outrageous amounts.
[00:55:27.609 --> 00:55:31.710]  And here's it says as low as one part per million, these effects can be had.
[00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:32.270]  It lowers IQ.
[00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:40.375]  And then we have another scientist confirming this way back in 1977, which is what some of his research is based on.
[00:55:40.395 --> 00:55:45.438]  He says, fluoride led to accelerated tumor growth at a rate of 25%.
[00:55:45.578 --> 00:55:49.500]  He said it's actually caused about 10,000 deaths.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:49.961]  Yeah.
[00:55:50.061 --> 00:55:52.982]  And furthermore, he said, fluoride readily crosses the placenta.
[00:55:53.062 --> 00:56:01.528]  Fluoride exposure to the developing brain, which is much more susceptible to injury, may possibly lead to brain damage of permanent nature.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.681]  Right, it says it right there.
[00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:09.946]  In 1977, Dr. Berg estimated that fluoride has actually caused about 10,000 deaths, according to his research.
[00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.769]  I mean, that is in the 70s, nearly 40 years ago.
[00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:18.552]  We're approaching 40 years on that study, and yet we're still fluoridating.
[00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:21.234]  We talk to, people go talk to our mayor about it.
[00:56:21.274 --> 00:56:21.775]  He laughs.
[00:56:21.815 --> 00:56:23.956]  He goes, well, my dentist says it's okay.
[00:56:25.117 --> 00:56:28.380]  Oh no, there's dentists that say, that will tell patients you're fluoride deficient.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.360]  Oh, totally.
[00:56:50.285 --> 00:56:54.027]  I think one-sixteenth of one tooth surface, or one-eighth of one tooth surface.
[00:56:54.487 --> 00:56:55.667]  And then it's the same research, though.
[00:56:55.687 --> 00:56:57.408]  It says it makes them brittle and break easily.
[00:56:57.568 --> 00:56:58.148]  There you go.
[00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.989]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:01.610]  So there really is no benefit.
[00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:03.251]  It is a disgusting poison.
[00:57:04.011 --> 00:57:12.495]  And it's amazing that we have to keep beating this bush, or beating this, I don't know, Trojan horse of putting fluoride.
[00:57:12.635 --> 00:57:18.077]  I've been to the fluoride plants where they put it in to the system, and the MSDS
[00:57:18.621 --> 00:57:25.703]  Sticker on the side of the giant tank that holds the fluoride that is so decrepit, it's rusting, it's gross.
[00:57:26.528 --> 00:57:28.309]  They have these do not enter signs on there.
[00:57:28.389 --> 00:57:32.212]  It's a four, which is the most, it's the highest of human reactivity.
[00:57:32.232 --> 00:57:37.915]  It causes death for prolonged exposure, can cause cancer, brain damage, and they don't care.
[00:57:37.935 --> 00:57:45.420]  They put it nine gallons an hour into our water supply, and that's right out of the mouth of the water treatment supervisor there.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.141]  Yeah, everybody should go look up that video on InfoWars about that.
[00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:49.222]  We put that out a couple years ago.
[00:57:49.242 --> 00:57:50.603]  It's like we're living in the dark ages.
[00:57:50.843 --> 00:57:54.765]  It really is, and this isn't, you know, we know what the real answer is.
[00:57:54.886 --> 00:57:55.566]  It has to do with
[00:57:55.987 --> 00:57:59.870]  Taking a toxic waste and filtering it through our public water supply.
[00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.672]  It has nothing to do with our health.
[00:58:02.072 --> 00:58:05.175]  Even if that was the reason they were doing it, that's not the real reason.
[00:58:05.195 --> 00:58:08.818]  The real reason is to get rid of this toxic waste so they don't have to dispose of it properly.
[00:58:09.279 --> 00:58:10.880]  And 28 studies have confirmed that.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:11.741]  Exactly.
[00:58:11.881 --> 00:58:15.344]  And then on top of that we have the Harvard study published that looked at those 28 studies.
[00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:24.903]  So another couple things that I just wanted to show everybody out there, and you might not even know about this, and we carry another product called the LifeStraw.
[00:58:25.764 --> 00:58:27.665]  And you can get it overhead shot there.
[00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:39.151]  And this little puppy, you basically just put it, you open it up just like that, pull that out, and you stick one piece in, there's your filter, and you
[00:58:39.847 --> 00:58:42.609]  Suck the water out just like that, and it'll filter it out.
[00:58:42.629 --> 00:58:44.810]  It's better than nothing if you're in an emergency situation.
[00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:45.791]  Well, it's actually great.
[00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:48.413]  I mean, if you think about it as well, people are drinking well water.
[00:58:48.973 --> 00:58:54.577]  And if you go to FindASpring.com, also you can see if there's a well in your area if you can't afford a filtration device.
[00:58:54.617 --> 00:59:01.362]  But maybe you can buy the LifeStraw because, sure, you're getting well water and it might not have fluoride in it, but it's great to get out that bacteria and everything like that.
[00:59:01.402 --> 00:59:03.723]  So anything is better than nothing, honestly.
[00:59:04.264 --> 00:59:04.724]  Exactly.
[00:59:04.964 --> 00:59:09.766]  If you could just get the LifeStraw or, you know, a Pro-Pure system, it will benefit you immensely.
[00:59:10.066 --> 00:59:11.027]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:15.749]  Yeah, and it's better to be prepared and do it now because it leads to health problems down the line.
[00:59:16.869 --> 00:59:21.852]  I've got several members of my family, they actually went to the doctor and the doctor said, how much water do you drink?
[00:59:22.712 --> 00:59:27.054]  And they answered and they said, well, it sounds like you're getting too much fluoride.
[00:59:27.194 --> 00:59:27.594]  I've never...
[00:59:29.522 --> 00:59:35.610]  I don't even want to say what family member this is, but I got a call from them saying, hey, how did you know about fluoride?
[00:59:36.151 --> 00:59:44.462]  I said, well, you know, I saw a World Net Daily article one day about fluoride in the water and there's nothing to worry about, and basically what I did
[00:59:44.949 --> 00:59:45.149]  Yes.
[01:00:01.841 --> 01:00:02.221]  We're good to go.
[01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:19.992]  And the toothpaste and the fluoride pills.
[01:00:20.632 --> 01:00:24.413]  Now they're talking about banning bottled water because people don't get enough fluoride.
[01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:28.375]  On Wikipedia, actually, we've done our best to continue editing it.
[01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:37.798]  If you go to Wikipedia and you look up bottled water, there's previous entries that say that there's a major concern about bottled water, that kids aren't getting enough fluoride and they're fluoride deficient.
[01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:44.460]  So, I mean, if you thought Wikipedia had any real credibility from the community, that's just the answer right there.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.081]  It's corporate credibility is what they're looking for there.
[01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:48.942]  And kids are the worst.
[01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:51.685]  They respond to it worse than anybody else.
[01:00:52.045 --> 01:00:53.306]  It really hits the kids hard.
[01:00:54.107 --> 01:00:58.111]  I've got two kids, and they're drinking fluoride-free water right now.
[01:00:58.331 --> 01:01:02.655]  And before that, we were putting bottled water through the filter just to get the plastic out of it.
[01:01:03.256 --> 01:01:05.277]  So, you know, I'm doing what I can.
[01:01:05.337 --> 01:01:06.999]  Everybody needs to do what they can out there.
[01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:08.240]  And I tell you what, this
[01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:11.315]  Bad boy right there, that Pro-Pure system.
[01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:13.255]  That is going to be the mainstay of my house.
[01:01:13.315 --> 01:01:15.076]  The other filter is going to be backup.
[01:01:15.116 --> 01:01:16.576]  And I like it because it's drip.
[01:01:16.957 --> 01:01:18.397]  It's not forcing the water through.
[01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:22.178]  It just slowly drips through and you can even hear it dripping.
[01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:25.460]  And you know, that's pure water that's coming out of there.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.660]  You can taste the difference.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.641]  You put that up against tap water any day.
[01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.462]  I'd put it up against bottle water any day.
[01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:31.643]  Yeah, I mean, do your own test, too.
[01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:34.365]  It's definitely a system that I would highly recommend.
[01:01:34.445 --> 01:01:39.768]  And also, just because you don't see this gunk coming out of your filter doesn't mean it's not in there.
[01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:42.610]  I'm also going to do another video taking apart the filters.
[01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:45.391]  You take apart your filter, there's some disgusting stuff in there.
[01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:48.954]  I've had emails coming in, just tens and tens of emails.
[01:01:49.594 --> 01:01:50.014]  We're good to go!
[01:02:16.129 --> 01:02:20.271]  Yeah, and guys, if you could back that up back to the MSDS and just hold it there for a second.
[01:02:20.331 --> 01:02:24.393]  People really need to see, and you know, they're just showing the hidden camera footage.
[01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:29.956]  We were not allowed to videotape the fluoride plant there, but I just held the camera down to my side.
[01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:30.756]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:31.017 --> 01:02:32.337]  They don't want people to see the truth.
[01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:35.219]  I mean, it's a public water supply area.
[01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.841]  Yeah, our tax money pays for it.
[01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:38.502]  But here we go.
[01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:44.689]  Life-threatening, major or permanent damage may result from a single or repeated exposure.
[01:02:44.729 --> 01:02:45.349]  So there you go.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:51.276]  That's what you're getting with fluoride, and that's in the concentrated form that they carry in tanker trucks across the United States.
[01:02:51.616 --> 01:03:01.927]  Mainly from Florida or they import it from China when they can't get enough here and they put that in your water supply and people just need to come to grips with reality and realize that it's a poison and that it needs to come out.
[01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:02.688]  I mean that's it.
[01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:07.033]  There's really no more debate about the issue and we shouldn't even have to be talking about this right now.
[01:03:07.213 --> 01:03:09.014]  Oh, I mean, it's mostly from China as well.
[01:03:09.034 --> 01:03:17.841]  And look at just a few days ago, hundreds of different Chinese officials making the drugs for the United States went to jail because they just were putting garbage in it.
[01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:24.425]  And that's a huge issue now that people taking drugs and other substances that are just fake or loaded with heavy metals or chlorine and stuff like that.
[01:03:24.886 --> 01:03:26.787]  Just Google fluoride toxic and go to images.
[01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:28.128]  There's an image.
[01:03:28.168 --> 01:03:29.469]  It's on your site, too, on InfoWars.
[01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:31.190]  You can see fluoride toxic InfoWars.
[01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:32.371]  There's a bag.
[01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:34.953]  It says sodium fluoride with a big skull on it.
[01:03:35.173 --> 01:03:36.094]  And that's a real shot.
[01:03:36.454 --> 01:03:36.654]  Yeah.
[01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:37.775]  No, it's poison.
[01:03:38.296 --> 01:03:39.777]  It was roach poison.
[01:03:39.797 --> 01:03:40.858]  It's also rat poison.
[01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:42.559]  You can use it to kill things with.
[01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:43.760]  That doesn't mean you should drink it.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.461]  Definitely not.
[01:03:44.481 --> 01:03:46.342]  It's as low as one pars per million as well.
[01:03:47.343 --> 01:03:48.224]  It's so disgusting.
[01:03:49.205 --> 01:03:51.166]  One last little product here.
[01:03:52.087 --> 01:03:57.832]  Since we're talking about preparedness and, you know, having the things we need to keep ourselves self-sufficient and healthy,
[01:03:58.152 --> 01:04:00.693]  Here's an interesting little thing that I don't think anybody's seen on camera yet.
[01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:01.814]  It's called the pocket socket.
[01:04:02.334 --> 01:04:06.256]  And you turn this thing around, you can charge your cell phone, charge your computer.
[01:04:06.296 --> 01:04:07.837]  I guess if you had enough people turning it.
[01:04:08.437 --> 01:04:11.379]  You gotta get two revelations per, two cranks per second.
[01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:15.161]  You get 10 watts at 120 volts DC.
[01:04:15.801 --> 01:04:16.962]  And it's a pretty robust unit.
[01:04:16.982 --> 01:04:18.703]  It looks like you can turn this thing for hours.
[01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:20.724]  I think that would go with a life straw.
[01:04:20.984 --> 01:04:22.505]  Both don't require any power.
[01:04:22.805 --> 01:04:24.746]  And in an emergency situation, that would be pretty useful.
[01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:25.326]  Also, iodine.
[01:04:27.427 --> 01:04:40.114]  That's the kind of information that is useful and that's the kind of information you put out.
[01:04:40.154 --> 01:04:44.277]  It's the kind of information we try to put out in addition to all the political stuff.
[01:04:44.317 --> 01:04:51.600]  We do have a strong concern for the healthy body maintaining that out there because that's the key.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.282]  If you're not healthy in your body and you're not healthy in your mind,
[01:04:55.014 --> 01:04:56.055]  You'll fall for anything.
[01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:57.515]  You'll be one of the slaves.
[01:04:57.635 --> 01:05:00.137]  You will gladly sit in front of the TV and waste your life away.
[01:05:00.977 --> 01:05:04.499]  And, you know, you're just not going to be part of the revolution.
[01:05:04.539 --> 01:05:09.742]  Because we're the revolution of ideas and of practices that are going to get us out of this dark age.
[01:05:09.762 --> 01:05:11.703]  Because eventually, fluoridation is going to stop.
[01:05:12.103 --> 01:05:13.224]  It's not too far down the line.
[01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:14.865]  They can keep putting stuff out there.
[01:05:14.925 --> 01:05:19.628]  I saw another, you know, bashing people who were against fluoridation article.
[01:05:19.748 --> 01:05:20.788]  And it just makes me sick.
[01:05:20.828 --> 01:05:22.089]  These people are in such denial.
[01:05:22.509 --> 01:05:25.973]  Believe it or not, there is actually information confirming what you just said.
[01:05:26.033 --> 01:05:26.953]  If your bacteria
[01:05:34.448 --> 01:05:34.728]  We're good.
[01:06:04.888 --> 01:06:11.271]  And then, you know, you say that and you talk about they're giving you propaganda against anti-fluoride people.
[01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:12.511]  Watch TV.
[01:06:13.051 --> 01:06:18.594]  Every single show, specifically cop shows, there's always some kooky guy and, you know, he has all these crazy ideas.
[01:06:18.634 --> 01:06:23.716]  And the one I was just watching, he was saying something like fluoride is bad and, you know, we should start eating healthy vegan.
[01:06:23.736 --> 01:06:25.977]  They were like, ha ha, look at this idiot, you know.
[01:06:26.057 --> 01:06:27.977]  As they're drinking tap water, you know.
[01:06:28.558 --> 01:06:28.878]  Of course.
[01:06:29.758 --> 01:06:30.939]  These people are so crazy.
[01:06:30.979 --> 01:06:33.760]  Most of those actors, they don't believe the BS they're spewing.
[01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:37.623]  They actually know because they have the money to pay for this stuff.
[01:06:37.643 --> 01:06:42.225]  So they're drinking pure water from halfway around the earth, you know.
[01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.126]  And none of them drink tap water.
[01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:46.767]  Even the horribly overweight and unhealthy ones?
[01:06:47.008 --> 01:06:47.748]  Yeah.
[01:06:48.128 --> 01:06:50.530]  It's considered like a low-class status.
[01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:53.091]  It's the dirtiest water you can possibly have.
[01:06:53.331 --> 01:06:57.335]  Yeah, and the water that they peddle to kids, ooh, now with more fluoride.
[01:06:57.575 --> 01:06:58.376]  Oh, man, it's just so disgusting.
[01:06:58.396 --> 01:07:00.097]  Yeah, don't buy Nestle brand water bottles.
[01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:00.738]  Exactly.
[01:07:00.918 --> 01:07:05.202]  A lot of them are loaded up with fluoride, and it's in the commercial, like, now with extra fluoride.
[01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:07.324]  Yeah, for your poison.
[01:07:07.785 --> 01:07:09.206]  Extra poison to keep you stupid.
[01:07:09.706 --> 01:07:11.889]  Anthony, I appreciate you coming on short notice.
[01:07:12.009 --> 01:07:12.769]  I love the video.
[01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:13.670]  I caught it yesterday.
[01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.333]  I took a weekend trip, and when I got back into town,
[01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:17.654]  I saw that video.
[01:07:17.674 --> 01:07:21.757]  It was the first thing I watched and I'm like, man, that is pure disgusting.
[01:07:22.478 --> 01:07:29.204]  Thanks for putting it out there because people really do need to see what the heck is in their water, you know, because then they'll make those changes.
[01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:31.386]  Those types of things are going to make people go, wait a minute.
[01:07:31.877 --> 01:07:35.861]  Yeah, I really hope it disgusts people, honestly, because it'll make them change their mind.
[01:07:35.881 --> 01:07:39.185]  You know, if they see some video of me talking for 45 minutes, a lot of people don't care.
[01:07:39.205 --> 01:07:41.807]  If they see that, though, that's going to change their mind.
[01:07:41.827 --> 01:07:46.132]  It's a minute, it's a minute, it's a little information nugget, and we need more of those out there.
[01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:47.593]  What's coming up with Natural Society?
[01:07:47.613 --> 01:07:48.915]  What are you guys working on this week?
[01:07:49.585 --> 01:07:59.413]  Well, if you see behind me, this is a short notice as you mentioned, but I'm actually building a full-fledged studio and we're going to do a lot more reports on water and everything like that and show you a lot of visuals, very short videos.
[01:08:00.153 --> 01:08:13.063]  Yeah, something I'm really interested in and have been covering, I actually broke the story on August 1st, is the 2045 program, which is essentially a program launched by a Russian scientist to give the wealthy elite, really only people who back him with
[01:08:13.243 --> 01:08:14.424]  Millions and millions of dollars.
[01:08:14.885 --> 01:08:16.526]  Artificial bodies by 2015.
[01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:25.075]  And then ultimately they want to have some type of a singularity project in which everyone has artificial brains and artificial bodies by 2045.
[01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.777]  Of course, it's only the wealthy elite who have this.
[01:08:28.298 --> 01:08:31.040]  And he's saying that they'll be quote-unquote immortal.
[01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:37.524]  And it sounds insane, but it's actually getting a lot of backing and a lot of media and financial help.
[01:08:37.624 --> 01:08:44.448]  So it's definitely something to watch and it's something extremely concerning because it threatens our humanity as an entire species.
[01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:45.848]  Definitely.
[01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:51.871]  When you have a lease that can live forever, then they don't have to reteach their tricks to their younglings.
[01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:53.652]  And, oh God.
[01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.334]  And get this, guess what controls the body?
[01:08:57.474 --> 01:08:58.415]  An RFID chip.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.082]  Oh, how nice.
[01:09:01.102 --> 01:09:05.484]  So then they can track you wherever you want to go and I guess just cut it off if you don't play by the rules at that point.
[01:09:05.504 --> 01:09:09.727]  Well, it essentially links to a supercomputer and then your quote-unquote artificial brain.
[01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:11.769]  All this sounds crazy, by the way, but just look it up.
[01:09:11.849 --> 01:09:13.790]  I mean, it's on NBC.
[01:09:15.391 --> 01:09:22.996]  This RFID chip will link to the supercomputer, which will then give signals to your artificial brain to control your artificial body.
[01:09:23.036 --> 01:09:24.557]  So you're not even a human anymore.
[01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:28.580]  You're essentially controlled by this system that just controls you as a whole.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.281]  That is ultra creepy.
[01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.682]  Well, thanks for coming on today.
[01:09:31.702 --> 01:09:32.303]  Appreciate it.
[01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:41.029]  Looking forward to your new videos on what comes out of your water filter and everybody should be shooting that all over the country and putting it out there to educate more people.
[01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.070]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[01:09:45.086 --> 01:09:46.247]  Well, and that's our show for today.
[01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:47.628]  I just want to give you a quick recap.
[01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:52.772]  Here is our Pro-Pure King model that we do sell at Infowars.com.
[01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:53.953]  We have several different models.
[01:09:53.973 --> 01:09:57.336]  This happens to be the brushed stainless steel, almost said aluminum.
[01:09:57.376 --> 01:09:58.097]  It's not aluminum.
[01:09:58.597 --> 01:09:59.358]  Stainless steel.
[01:10:00.258 --> 01:10:03.041]  It's got a little glass reservoir.
[01:10:03.061 --> 01:10:04.282]  You can tell how much water's in there.
[01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:07.584]  I got the fluoride filters and the regular filters with mine.
[01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.086]  That's the main one in our house.
[01:10:10.487 --> 01:10:11.848]  The pocket socket.
[01:10:12.489 --> 01:10:16.911]  Very cool little item for, you know, you need to charge your iPod, you're out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:17.891]  Well, there you go.
[01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:20.893]  Five minutes later, your iPod's charged.
[01:10:21.573 --> 01:10:23.134]  Also build up that right arm strength.
[01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:33.978]  And the LifeStraw for those times when you really need a drink of water and you don't have filtered water anywhere, say you're in the middle of a stream or a pond.
[01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:35.599]  Read the manual.
[01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:37.600]  It's not very big.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:37.980]  Check it out.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.841]  You can keep that in a backpack in your bug-out bag.
[01:10:41.778 --> 01:10:53.965]  Very cool products, because what it's all about is getting prepared, because as we talked about earlier, the banks are making plans for a collapse, and when the banks collapse again, it's going to be hard times for a while.
[01:10:53.985 --> 01:11:02.710]  So we're all going to have to band together, we're going to have to communicate with each other, set up those modes of communication to keep the information flowing, because that's what it's all about.
[01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.967]  So thanks to Anthony Gucciardi of Natural Society.
[01:11:06.347 --> 01:11:08.267]  Thanks to the crew out there working really hard.
[01:11:08.968 --> 01:11:10.768]  They gave me a three-day weekend.
[01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:13.469]  I got to leave on Thursday night and get out of town.
[01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:15.289]  I had a real good time with my family.
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:17.110]  And do that with your family out there.
[01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.071]  Go out and spend some time with your family.
[01:11:19.551 --> 01:11:22.391]  And don't sit around and watch YouTube videos all day.
[01:11:22.772 --> 01:11:26.233]  Or definitely don't watch mainstream media all day because you will get brainwashed.
[01:11:26.873 --> 01:11:27.493]  That's our show.
[01:11:28.226 --> 01:11:32.608]  Remember to get that Prison Planet TV membership if you are watching this on YouTube right now.
[01:11:32.748 --> 01:11:34.969]  Just type in prisonplanet.tv.
[01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:37.330]  We have a 15-day free trial.
[01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:38.850]  It's about $5.95 a month.
[01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:41.571]  It supports everything we do here, and we surely do appreciate it.
[01:11:42.192 --> 01:11:44.153]  And with that, I'm Rob Dube, signing off.
[01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:45.053]  Until next time.
