[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.811]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:05.074]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:15.837]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:17.299]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:27.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.873]  Bernadine Smith's our guest for another 30 minutes.
[00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:54.662]  If you want to talk to her, have any questions for her, the toll-free number is 800-259-9231, and she founded the Second Amendment Committee.
[00:00:55.143 --> 00:01:00.769]  She's been a stalwart researcher on the global takeover, but the best way to describe this is
[00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.550]  Robber barons in our own country in Europe set up the U.N.
[00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.851]  so they could transfer our sovereignty to it.
[00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:07.732]  It's not like the U.N.'
[00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:09.012]  's taking us over.
[00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:14.915]  Traders within our government set it up to then parallel and move the power over into it.
[00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.356]  Now our military, they openly tell Congress, is under the U.N.
[00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.237]  and NATO, and now we're being told they're going to be on our streets.
[00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:28.460]  And we're told they're for us, the number one terrorist, conservative libertarians that believe in a world government.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.321]  All the military training manuals say that.
[00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.642]  And they say we're insane, even as they announce it on the news.
[00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:41.446]  Bernadine, what about this paradox of world government doesn't exist, and you're crazy if you say it, but world government's here to save you.
[00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.467]  I mean, that's just amazing.
[00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:46.349]  And then I want to continue along the lines of Rand Paul.
[00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.493]  Yes, we need to get Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, because no Democrat's going to win the Senate race now here in Texas up against him.
[00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.571]  We need to... I mean, hey, let's see it.
[00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.252]  Let's see it all on trial.
[00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:03.033]  Let's bring the whole system out in the open.
[00:02:03.493 --> 00:02:05.114]  Because America has been occupied.
[00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:09.216]  Now, they haven't fully implemented the occupation, but they've hijacked us.
[00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:12.898]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:19.302]  And what we're doing is we sent what you received from me, you know,
[00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:21.268]  Uh, the White Finder.
[00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.170]  Now, the White Finder is on my website.
[00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.573]  I just already talked about that on this program.
[00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:26.914]  It's 75 pages.
[00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:39.006]  But, um, all of this in a brown-covered book with the evidences of, of, uh, how they counterfeited our permission to disarm us.
[00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:53.599]  This has all been sent to Rand Paul and I think the best thing we can get people to do is to call Rand Paul's office and ask him to pursue this as an official study.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:06.567]  Otherwise, I don't know how we're going to move without the cooperation of the federal government itself reporting on its own
[00:03:08.973 --> 00:03:10.696]  I don't think so.
[00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.987]  What if they come for the guns that we have to resist?
[00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:47.528]  What's that again?
[00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:52.072]  But if they do, if they do try to come to the guns, people are going to resist.
[00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.993]  We want to stop it before it gets to that.
[00:03:54.454 --> 00:03:57.737]  Well that's what I'm saying, is that there will be a fight.
[00:03:57.897 --> 00:04:05.684]  People will not, they're not so ignorant as to turn in their guns when they get an order.
[00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:21.771]  They know better, because without a republic... I can guarantee you, I can guarantee you, most gun owners are going to hide their guns, and then it'll make the gun culture even stronger, and then a lot of people are going to start...
[00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:25.170]  Listen, Bernadine, that's what I've said.
[00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.131]  The plan is to start a civil war.
[00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:30.434]  I don't know if you ever hear my show, but I've been saying that every day for the last year.
[00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:36.859]  Well, unfortunately, I haven't heard it, but that's what I'm seeing is a civil war is in the offing.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.665]  And unless this is brought out, we're not going to stop it.
[00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.547]  These facts have to be brought out.
[00:04:46.927 --> 00:04:51.691]  That's why you got what you got in the mailing with the white binder and the brown cover book.
[00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:52.952]  Absolutely.
[00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:58.357]  I want to come back and briefly get into the UN Treaty and talk about how they disarm people in other countries.
[00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.898]  And then we're going to take a few phone calls from Bernadine Smith.
[00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:04.721]  We'll give you her website so you can get to the PDFs of these documents.
[00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:09.025]  The worst drought in 50 years continues.
[00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.208]  And the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:15.970]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.431]  Not only corn, but soy,
