[00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:06.379]  I'm good.
[00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:46.440]  It's August 14th, it's InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Paul Jersley-Fox and coming up on the show...
[00:00:49.738 --> 00:01:01.103]  Tonight, the ruling class accelerates the planned economic implosion as the Federal Reserve warns big banks to prepare for a worst-case scenario.
[00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:07.146]  Then, a new brand of facial recognition technology developed for Facebook.
[00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:10.948]  Check in with your face and verify your account.
[00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:15.749]  Plus, FAA documents show that unmanned drones over U.S.
[00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.730]  skies pose a huge safety risk.
[00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:26.093]  Meanwhile, defense contractors have spent $2.3 million lobbying Congress to open U.S.
[00:01:26.193 --> 00:01:26.853]  airspace.
[00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:32.835]  And finally, Alex Jones talks with Webster Tarpley about the impending economic collapse.
[00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:37.717]  All that and more, up next, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.067]  Top story tonight, Rome burned, will we?
[00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:54.788]  And this is an article I put together with Alex Jones.
[00:01:55.309 --> 00:02:02.793]  As America's engineered economic implosion accelerates, the parallels with how the Roman Empire fell are staggering.
[00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:13.439]  America is now ruled by a gaggle of completely corrupt financial terrorists who will stop at nothing to hollow out the country in pursuit of their own maniacal and selfish gain.
[00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:29.691]  It's precisely parallels Rome's rapacious ruling emperors and senators of the 5th century who were so obsessed with seizing wealth and control that they ended up destroying their own culture, their own country, and the whole empire in the process.
[00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:38.151]  So basically this is mainly about the planned financial implosion with, of course, the so-called stress tests on the banks coming up.
[00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:43.575]  The banks have been told by the Federal Reserve, prepare for a collapse and the government's not going to help you.
[00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:51.621]  But it's also about the innumerable similarities that 21st century America shares with the Roman Empire.
[00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.945]  And it's just amazing how close they parallel, how close they match up.
[00:02:56.806 --> 00:03:06.597]  You know, we've got the United States with troops stationed in some 130 countries now, outstripping anything the Romans ever had in terms of occupation.
[00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:17.449]  But, of course, sharing the same impossible task of maintaining such a sprawling empire, when the US can't afford it, gone bankrupt, 16 trillion in debt.
[00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:33.212]  Meanwhile, we've got the ruling greedy elite centralizing power and wealth, capitalizing, hijacking the very financial crisis they created to do so, just as the Roman emperors and senators did back in the Empire.
[00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:40.780]  And also, of course, record numbers of Americans, about a third of the whole population, on some form of government welfare.
[00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:43.087]  Same situation in Rome.
[00:03:43.147 --> 00:03:58.432]  So again, we've also got the moral decline of America, you know, added to the obsession with sports and entertainment, which is directly contributing to the decay in society, because people are just obsessed with entertainment, bread and circuses.
[00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:00.733]  They've abandoned their civic duties.
[00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.033]  They're no longer interested.
[00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:03.894]  Same thing happened in Rome.
[00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.414]  Almost exactly the same thing.
[00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.635]  That's, of course, where the phrase bread and circuses came from.
[00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:10.076]  There's actually a poem
[00:04:11.064 --> 00:04:15.609]  Or a quote in this article written by the poet Juvenal from 100 AD.
[00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.373]  He was talking about Rome at the time.
[00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:28.465]  And he wrote about how people had sacrificed their involvement in real affairs, you know, which directly impacted their lives and substituted them for bread and circuses.
[00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.008]  Exactly the same thing happening in America today.
[00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:49.854]  Just as in Rome, we've got in America a situation where an overwhelming number of illegal immigrants have flooded in and refused to assimilate to the point where they're now trying to actually claim their own territory, just as the tribes that flooded into Rome did all those centuries ago.
[00:04:50.715 --> 00:05:00.981]  Again, same parallel, you know, we've got these La Rasa movements, we've got the Mexican flag being flown above the American flag in places over on the West Coast, we've got race being played off against race.
[00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:03.243]  Exactly what happened in Rome.
[00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:16.551]  You can go through all the scholarly texts about how Rome collapsed, and in almost every instance in society, in the economy, in culture, America parallels Rome in every sense.
[00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:17.552]  It's scary.
[00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:20.644]  So, you know, where's it all leading?
[00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:23.427]  It might take a couple of hundred years.
[00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:33.234]  The Roman Empire lasted, for what, nearly a thousand years, so... We don't know the time frame, but what we do know is, short term, all this is going to lead to riots and civil unrest.
[00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:38.898]  And eventually, it's going to lead to the collapse of America, just as Rome collapsed 1,600 years ago.
[00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.001]  So basically, this article's about the ruling class.
[00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:53.745]  Are they so consumed by their avarice and lust for power that their actions could lead to the actual collapse of Western civilization?
[00:05:54.626 --> 00:06:01.169]  Because it's happened before in history with the Roman Empire and other empires, and there's no reason it can't happen again.
[00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.950]  So Rome burned.
[00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.730]  Will we?
[00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.732]  Important article up at Infowars.com that I put together with Alex Jones.
[00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:08.933]  Moving on.
[00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:14.153]  National Weather Service follows DHS in huge ammo purchase.
[00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:18.837]  And this is my article at InfoWars.com, also linked on DrudgeReport.com today.
[00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:24.502]  Why would the National Weather Service need to purchase large quantities of powerful ammo?
[00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:35.993]  That's the question many are asking after the Federal Agency followed in the footsteps of the Department of Homeland Security in putting out a solicitation for 46,000 rounds of hollow point bullets.
[00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:49.958]  A solicitation which appears on the FedBizOpps website asks for 16,000 rounds of S&W jacketed hollow point bullets noted for their strength to be delivered to locations in Ellsworth, Maine and New Bedford, Massachusetts.
[00:06:50.358 --> 00:07:01.002]  A further 6,000 rounds of S&W hollow point bullets will be sent to Wall, New Jersey with another 24,000 rounds of the same bullets heading to a weather station in St.
[00:07:01.062 --> 00:07:02.023]  Petersburg, Florida.
[00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:11.961]  And this solicitation, which is on the FedBizOpps website, also asks for 500 paper targets to be delivered to these same locations.
[00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:19.371]  So you've got hollow point bullets, which rip apart organs on impact with the human body, and then paper targets.
[00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:20.653]  Doesn't quite make sense.
[00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:50.834]  But, since this story was picked up by the Drudge Report earlier today, no less than the Washington Post waded in and quoted the NOAA, that's the federal organization above the National Weather Service, as claiming that this solicitation for all these thousands of rounds of hollow point bullets was a quote, clerical error, and that the ammo is not going to the National Weather Service, but instead to the NOAA Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:08:02.549]  So basically they've come out and said it was an error, it was a mistake, that they never intended to send them to the National Weather Service, but they're going to this other office under the same branch of the federal government.
[00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:12.338]  But whoever it's going to, and remember this is the same government that ships guns to Mexican drug cartels and the Fast and Furious, you know, they've proven they can't be trusted.
[00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:13.960]  The question remains,
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.043]  Why do they need such powerful bullets if they're shooting at paper targets for training drills?
[00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.423]  Doesn't make sense.
[00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:31.907]  Why do you need to buy bullets that are designed to expand on impact with the human body and tear open organs if you're shooting at paper targets?
[00:08:32.347 --> 00:08:34.068]  You know, why not just buy cheaper bullets?
[00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:40.085]  Well, it's the same question, of course, that's being asked of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:08:40.105 --> 00:08:55.113]  450 million rounds of hollow point bullets purchased back in March, followed by another 750 million rounds of assorted bullets in a current solicitation that's about to expire in the next few days.
[00:08:55.153 --> 00:09:00.876]  So we're talking over a billion rounds of bullets that the DHS has or is about to purchase.
[00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:05.377]  And again, they're telling us it's for training and target practice.
[00:09:05.617 --> 00:09:09.939]  Why are they buying these massively powerful bullets for shooting at targets?
[00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.339]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:19.822]  Of course, we know that the DHS is also buying large quantities of riot gear and telling us that civil unrest is right around the corner.
[00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:25.839]  But why, amidst all these mass shootings, is the Second Amendment being demonized?
[00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:32.104]  You know, we've got legislation introduced by the Democrats to ban the sale of ammo in large quantities online.
[00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:44.955]  Why, when that's happening, is the federal government consecutively arming itself to the teeth with ammo, and then claiming it's a clerical error when it's being sent to the weather service, in fact it's going somewhere else?
[00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:52.774]  Why is the NOAA buying bullets that rip apart internal organs if it's just for target practice?
[00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:59.077]  I mean, the DHS has refused to answer questions as to why they're buying these hollow-point bullets.
[00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:01.979]  Remember, they're actually banned in warfare.
[00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:09.023]  They're considered that deadly and dangerous that they're banned under the Geneva Convention in the context of warfare.
[00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:20.111]  And another aspect to this, as the denials flood in, is an article out of the Hill, Obama administration, UN Arms Treaty shouldn't regulate ammunition.
[00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.994]  So while they're trying to ban it, the large purchase of ammunition online for American citizens,
[00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:41.217]  They don't want the UN to do the same thing, because, as this article states, the Department of State Conventional Weapons Destruction Program has funded the destruction of over 90,000 tons of excess loosely secured or at-risk ammunition since 2003.
[00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:42.718]  So there's another question.
[00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:47.258]  The DHS has bought over a billion rounds of ammo.
[00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:54.040]  You know, is this merely about trying to keep it out of the hands of the American people, or are they actually planning on using it?
[00:10:55.325 --> 00:11:03.491]  And in fact, there was another interesting aspect to this article thrown up by a commenter on the article that was linked on drugreporter.com from Infowars.
[00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:14.758]  And he talks about the fact that these bullets are being delivered to an address which shares its location with the National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:11:15.118 --> 00:11:24.645]  And if you actually go and look on the solicitation, the NED is listed as the recipient for these bullets under the same banner as the NOAA.
[00:11:26.007 --> 00:11:32.272]  So why is the government buying bullets for a non-governmental organization?
[00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:37.256]  It's quasi-governmental, of course it's a CIA front, but officially it's non-governmental.
[00:11:38.377 --> 00:11:41.360]  And then getting all shifty about where these bullets are going.
[00:11:42.128 --> 00:12:02.483]  Could it be that the weather service, the fact that they were being sent to the weather service, which was in the original solicitation before they came out today and said no, that was a clerical error, could it be a cover for the fact that they're sending ammo to the National Endowment for Democracy, which is one of these regime change shadowy groups run by the CIA?
[00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:10.129]  Could these bullets be going to the Syrian rebels that have openly been supported by the National Endowment for Democracy?
[00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.712]  As the US denies sending any arms to the rebels whatsoever.
[00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:22.676]  So we'll continue to have updates on this story as they come in, but very interesting shifting explanations as to where these bullets are going.
[00:12:22.997 --> 00:12:28.100]  And the DHS refuses to say anything about why they've purchased over a billion rounds of ammo.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:36.965]  And actually, just 10 minutes ago I got a Facebook message with a link to another solicitation where Social Security is ordering 177,000 rounds of bullets.
[00:12:40.507 --> 00:12:50.793]  So the federal government across the board is arming to the teeth while it tells the American people that they should disarm, and as it gears up for riots and civil unrest.
[00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:51.694]  Very interesting.
[00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:53.215]  Next story.
[00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:58.338]  FAA documents show drones over US pose huge safety risk.
[00:12:58.398 --> 00:13:00.519]  This is Steve Watson, Infowars.com.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:08.064]  Recently released FAA documents have raised yet more questions surrounding the opening up of US Geisse unmanned surveillance drones.
[00:13:08.544 --> 00:13:23.199]  Thousands of pages of FAA experimental drone flight records that were obtained by the Center for Investigative Reporting detail just how complicated it would be to operate thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles safely without spending billions of dollars.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.000]  So...
[00:13:25.248 --> 00:13:41.217]  As we know, the FAA recently relaxed the rules on drones operating in US skies, which as we have seen, you know, it's opened up this feeding frenzy of private companies trying to make drones for the government, trying to secure contracts with law enforcement agencies.
[00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.811]  All to spy on you and me.
[00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:56.415]  And of course, this was all accompanied by an admitted propaganda campaign run by the drone industry, which sought to create the fallacy that drones were safe, secure and beneficial.
[00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:59.817]  Well, the truth turns out to be quite the opposite.
[00:14:00.337 --> 00:14:03.018]  Because in these tests which these documents expose,
[00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:09.393]  Of course, which led to the FAA green-lighting the use of surveillance drones in American skies.
[00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:12.036]  The drones kept crashing.
[00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:17.883]  And that was without any other aircraft even being in the vicinity during these tests.
[00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:30.815]  Here's from the article continuing, the FAA strictly confined the testing to areas of space where there were no other aircraft, precisely because the drones have no capabilities to avoid collisions.
[00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:37.699]  They're talking about 30,000 of them, just for starters, and they've got no capability to avoid collisions.
[00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:42.842]  In numerous tests, the drones still crashed into other objects.
[00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:56.897]  Despite such warnings, FAA Acting Administrator Michael Hurter noted last week during the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Conference in Las Vegas that over the next three years, drones will begin rolling out.
[00:14:57.901 --> 00:15:06.443]  He added that building, this is a quote, building human consensus is an equally important task and unbelievably complicated.
[00:15:06.983 --> 00:15:19.146]  So in other words, you know, keeping the PR on message, that it's all safe and secure, is more important than the fact that, according to the FAA's own tests, these things are going to kill people.
[00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.167]  They're going to crash into airliners.
[00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:32.084]  You know, even though these drones in the test run by the FAA have proven to be completely unsafe crashing into objects, they've green-lighted them anyway.
[00:15:32.505 --> 00:15:34.887]  I mean, this is a huge public safety issue.
[00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:42.914]  And they've come out in the aftermath of this exposé and said, don't worry, we're gonna spend another two billion dollars to fix this.
[00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:47.776]  Even though they've already green-lighted it, knowing that it's a massive safety risk.
[00:15:47.816 --> 00:16:00.638]  But don't worry, another $2 billion that America can't afford is going to go into perfecting these drones so they can be used to, you know, spy on cattle ranches in Nebraska and Iowa and wherever else.
[00:16:02.098 --> 00:16:04.159]  So, massive public safety issue.
[00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:04.839]  Cover up.
[00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:10.360]  The FAA green-lighted it anyway, even though they knew the drones were crashing into other objects.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.560]  They gave the go-ahead.
[00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:15.357]  Black box standards coming for cars.
[00:16:15.977 --> 00:16:16.978]  This is out of the Hill.
[00:16:17.938 --> 00:16:24.583]  New federal standards for black boxes that record information leading up to auto accidents will take effect September 1st.
[00:16:24.643 --> 00:16:27.645]  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rule on Tuesday.
[00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:34.250]  The decision means the new standards for the devices will not be delayed by one year as automakers had requested.
[00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:42.052]  The federal standards will apply only to cars that are voluntarily outfitted with event data recorders, also known as black boxes.
[00:16:42.512 --> 00:16:52.335]  But while the government does not yet require all cars to have black boxes installed, NHTSA is still thought to be considering a federal mandate as an next step, possibly this year.
[00:16:53.499 --> 00:17:09.638]  Now, back in July, Obama already signed the MAC 21 bill into law, which initially mandated black boxes in all vehicles from 2015 onwards, and I believe that was later, in the final version of the bill, restricted to just commercial vehicles.
[00:17:10.836 --> 00:17:15.640]  But now it's going to be voluntary, don't worry, to begin with, and then they'll review it a year down the line.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.443]  So like most things, it's going to be voluntary, eventually it's going to be mandatory.
[00:17:19.963 --> 00:17:27.409]  And this, of course, is about taking the first step to the tax-by-the-mile system, a de facto carbon tax.
[00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:35.735]  And most new cars already have these black boxes installed when they come fresh out of the factory, so they're already in there, they've just got to switch them on.
[00:17:36.716 --> 00:17:47.942]  But the ultimate goal, of course, is not only to tax you by the mile in the name of saving Mother Earth while all the money goes to, you know, the Rothschild family in Al Gore because they own the carbon trading systems.
[00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:54.745]  It's also about this process of having to obtain government permission merely to start your vehicle.
[00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:57.606]  It's about strangling the right to mobility.
[00:17:58.007 --> 00:18:04.270]  Because they've already developed the technology, the face-scanning camera, that will decide whether or not you're allowed to drive.
[00:18:05.242 --> 00:18:13.929]  And when that's hooked into the police database, or, you know, the domestic extremist database, then if the government says no, you can forget about driving.
[00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:20.394]  This is all about permission to exercise your God-given rights, which should require no permission whatsoever.
[00:18:21.115 --> 00:18:26.977]  So that's the Plandopolis scenario, you know, where only the ultra-rich will be allowed to drive cars.
[00:18:27.037 --> 00:18:34.681]  Everybody else has to, you know, book them in advance and maybe a taxi will come and pick you up, but you'll have no rights to even drive your own car.
[00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:36.601]  That's what they're aiming for.
[00:18:37.942 --> 00:18:38.962]  And this is the start of it.
[00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:42.564]  Tax by the mile system, which they're already now trying to mandate.
[00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:51.789]  And while on the topic of face scanning technology, Face Deals scans your face to customise deals by Adon Salazar.
[00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:53.030]  This is Infowars.com.
[00:18:53.391 --> 00:19:01.461]  Check in with your face is the motto of a US marketing company which is using to preface its new face scan deal linking technology.
[00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:06.465]  Red Pepper out of Nashville, Tennessee has developed technology that says it will save you money.
[00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:11.088]  However, the methods they engage are much more intrusive than your standard grocery store coupon.
[00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:25.319]  The process starts when a face deal's camera, mounted at a venue's front door, scans and matches your face's likeness to your Facebook profile, generating customized deals for your area according to your likes.
[00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:32.167]  And it's all about making Big Brother sound trendy, as we've seen before.
[00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:46.838]  Well, encouragingly, when I actually went and watched the video, the promo video, with this really trendy guy selling it in a really trendy voice, for all the hipsters out there, the response was unenthusiastic, to say the least.
[00:19:47.714 --> 00:19:48.675]  Here's some comments.
[00:19:49.435 --> 00:19:51.696]  No thank you makes me want to delete my Facebook.
[00:19:52.337 --> 00:19:56.499]  Stupid mainstream hipsters thinking this kind of privacy invasion is so cool.
[00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:00.161]  Starts with this and graduates to the chip.
[00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:05.544]  These trendy emo retro hipsters need to just move to California and build a wall around it.
[00:20:07.543 --> 00:20:10.406]  It's all about pressure from above and pressure from below.
[00:20:10.446 --> 00:20:17.134]  You know, we've got Big Brother being forced on us by the state with these face-scanning cameras for law enforcement.
[00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:20.077]  We've got the license plate scanners going in everywhere.
[00:20:21.035 --> 00:20:22.236]  That's pressure from above.
[00:20:22.897 --> 00:20:29.342]  Of course, the recently exposed trackwire system is going to be the central fulcrum of that face-scanning database system.
[00:20:29.783 --> 00:20:42.834]  But then, we've also got it being imposed from below by all these hipsters who, you know, push for their privacy to be completely eviscerated in the name of convenience and trendiness.
[00:20:43.755 --> 00:20:50.298]  And sharing all their likes with Big Brother so Big Brother can sell them nice little deals and incentives.
[00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:54.240]  So it's pressure from above from the state, it's pressure from below.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.342]  This artificially generated trendy culture.
[00:20:59.203 --> 00:21:06.126]  You of course remember the microchips embedded for entrance to the Baja Beach Clubs that came out back in, what was it, 2004.
[00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:06.406]  Again,
[00:21:08.627 --> 00:21:17.074]  All very trendy to be in the system in the Matrix, have your arm scanned by Barco so you can get into the trendy VIP area of the club.
[00:21:18.254 --> 00:21:21.457]  And all the hipsters are right behind it, so, you know, good luck with that.
[00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:31.885]  I'm not going to be a part of it, and a lot of people aren't, according to the response, which was devastating to say the least to this YouTube promo video, which got completely trashed.
[00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:40.068]  Moving on now, Paul Ryan sold shares on same day as private briefing of banking crisis.
[00:21:40.108 --> 00:21:41.189]  This is out of The Guardian.
[00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:53.321]  Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate, sold stock in US banks on the same day he attended a confidential meeting where top level officials disclosed the sector was heading for a deep crisis.
[00:21:53.942 --> 00:22:07.827]  The congressman on Monday denied profiting from information gleaned from the meeting on 18 September 2008, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and others outlined their fears for the banking sector.
[00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:10.549]  His office said he had no control over the trades.
[00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:21.813]  Public records show that on the same day as the meeting, Ryan sold stock in troubled banks, including Wachovia and Citigroup, and bought shares in Goldman Sachs, Paulson's old employer,
[00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.157]  And a bank that had been disclosed to be stronger than many of its rivals.
[00:22:25.437 --> 00:22:27.540]  The sale was not illegal at the time.
[00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:30.443]  So, you know, what a surprise.
[00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:32.206]  Yet another compromised politician.
[00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.428]  He's now going to be Mitt Romney's running mate.
[00:22:35.182 --> 00:22:39.585]  You know, another insider on the take, another water carrier for the banking elite.
[00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:47.912]  He's got his dirty hands involved in these little insider deals before they know the bank's going to go down selling shares, buying shares in others.
[00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:54.397]  And as we exposed last night on the show, I mean, Paul Ryan is just another big government
[00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:57.383]  You know, wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:22:57.403 --> 00:22:59.046]  He's not a real Conservative.
[00:22:59.746 --> 00:23:06.134]  But the talking heads have told us that, you know, the Conservative movement is all happy and excited about him running as a VP.
[00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.579]  So what exactly are they excited about?
[00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:12.782]  Is it, you know, the fact he said yes to No Child Left Behind?
[00:23:13.203 --> 00:23:14.885]  The expansion of Medicare?
[00:23:15.305 --> 00:23:17.307]  He really loves all that kind of socialism.
[00:23:17.868 --> 00:23:21.392]  Is it the fact that he continually supports all the unconstitutional wars?
[00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:23.434]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[00:23:23.754 --> 00:23:26.817]  But now, Paul Wright, he's got his hand in the till.
[00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:30.980]  And he's being exposed as another water carrier for the banking league.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.443]  So, don't expect a lot of change with him if Mitt Romney gets in as president.
[00:23:37.824 --> 00:23:39.765]  Quote of the day now from Thomas Paine.
[00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:45.128]  If there must be trouble, let it be in my day that my child may have peace.
[00:23:46.332 --> 00:23:51.314]  So he's basically saying, you know, if there's trouble, if there's a cancer in society, let's deal with it now.
[00:23:51.354 --> 00:23:53.935]  Let's not lump it on the next generation.
[00:23:54.415 --> 00:24:07.220]  Well, unfortunately, as you know, a lot of people have not followed that advice and have instead, with their obsession with bread and circuses, as we talked about earlier in comparison to Rome, have chosen to pass these troubles on to the next generation.
[00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:15.624]  So, you know, I guess that's our job to make them face reality and realise that if you ignore a cancer, then it only gets worse.
[00:24:16.015 --> 00:24:25.950]  We're going to go to break now on InfoWars Nightly News, but stick around because we've got quite a feisty interview with Webster Tarplay talking to Alex Jones about the coming economic collapse.
[00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.550]  Stay tuned.
[00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:57.259]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:06.364]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn from friends like Ted Anderson about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[00:25:07.204 --> 00:25:12.527]  And I started promoting him some because I'd seen his weight loss, his health, all the things that happened for him.
[00:25:13.187 --> 00:25:17.730]  Now, I've only stuck my toe in the water and lost a little over 40 pounds, and I'm still big.
[00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:25.954]  Aaron Dykes, who you know has been working here for six years at InfoWars.com, lost 92 pounds.
[00:25:25.974 --> 00:25:27.814]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[00:25:28.255 --> 00:25:30.976]  He began to hear the guest on my show a year and a half ago.
[00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:38.740]  He began to do his own research and he implemented the information that Longevity and InfoWarsTeam.com is promoting.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.661]  And had dramatic results.
[00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:53.045]  And that's why I'm telling our listeners and viewers, you need to go to Infowarsteam.com and try just the Essential Fatty Acids, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, and the Polymers Plus.
[00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:58.387]  And I believe you'll be blown away by the dramatic results that I've had and Aaron's had.
[00:25:58.407 --> 00:26:00.528]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[00:26:00.568 --> 00:26:01.068]  Your story.
[00:26:01.408 --> 00:26:03.971]  I've been overweight in my life for far too long.
[00:26:04.352 --> 00:26:08.717]  Years ago, I lost a lot of weight, more than 50 pounds, but it came right back.
[00:26:08.757 --> 00:26:09.879]  I wasn't able to keep it off.
[00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:16.367]  More recently, I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[00:26:16.407 --> 00:26:20.472]  It just didn't happen, and I wasn't able to stay motivated long enough to reach my goals.
[00:26:20.632 --> 00:26:27.057]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com and the great products, Tangy Tangerine, kind of the base one to start with.
[00:26:27.437 --> 00:26:32.220]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy, I wanted that nutrition.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.784]  Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[00:26:38.124 --> 00:26:43.849]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[00:26:43.949 --> 00:26:45.870]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:51.873]  They don't, but pharmacist Ben Fuchs explains that's what happens if you're overweight because you're no longer hungry because you're getting what you need.
[00:26:52.053 --> 00:26:58.837]  When you start taking their proprietary formulation of essential fatty acids, it blows the competition away.
[00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:06.861]  When you start taking Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymbers Plus and the other key longevity products, it is incredible.
[00:27:07.301 --> 00:27:13.625]  It was so easy to lose weight and regain health for myself, barely without trying, just from taking the products.
[00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:29.258]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com so you can see for yourselves the incredible results Aaron and others have achieved with longevity products that are discounted at wholesale prices at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:35.103]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:27:36.164 --> 00:27:39.829]  The revolution against tyranny starts individually with our bodies.
[00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.172]  There is a global awakening happening.
[00:27:42.533 --> 00:27:45.617]  The sleeping giant that is humanity is awakening.
[00:27:45.857 --> 00:27:49.302]  And a big part of that fight starts at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:27:53.675 --> 00:27:56.396]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:27:56.696 --> 00:28:01.539]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:08.902]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:14.464]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:28:14.684 --> 00:28:18.465]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:28:18.745 --> 00:28:23.286]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:28:23.486 --> 00:28:28.728]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:32.069]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:34.490]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.371]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:41.972]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:28:42.412 --> 00:28:49.474]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[00:28:49.654 --> 00:28:50.694]  We're getting prepared.
[00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:51.354]  Are you?
[00:28:51.594 --> 00:28:53.315]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:05.652]  And we are back on InfoWars Nightly News on this August 14th, 2012 Tuesday edition.
[00:29:05.672 --> 00:29:10.674]  I want to thank Paul Joseph Watson for doing the news portion of the transmission this evening.
[00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:15.696]  Now the information we're about to cover is of the greatest import.
[00:29:16.516 --> 00:29:19.697]  And finally people are starting to listen and pay more attention.
[00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:23.255]  Dr. Webster Tarpley is going to join us here in a moment.
[00:29:23.275 --> 00:29:24.235]  We're getting him on the line.
[00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:27.556]  But first, let me just show you some headlines here.
[00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.076]  Exclusive!
[00:29:29.196 --> 00:29:29.456]  U.S.
[00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:32.577]  banks told to make plans for preventing collapse.
[00:29:33.377 --> 00:29:38.618]  And this is out of Reuters and the Chicago Tribune, carrying a Reuters story.
[00:29:39.198 --> 00:29:39.878]  Der Spiegel.
[00:29:41.199 --> 00:29:43.359]  Investors prepare for euro collapse.
[00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:47.320]  That's one of the most prestigious publications in Europe, not just Germany.
[00:29:48.138 --> 00:29:49.841]  Undoubtedly the most prestigious in Germany.
[00:29:49.881 --> 00:29:53.065]  So when you see it there, the writing is on the wall big time.
[00:29:53.385 --> 00:29:54.807]  Chinese companies pull out of U.S.
[00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:55.508]  stock markets.
[00:29:55.608 --> 00:29:56.570]  Incredible headline.
[00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.991]  Associated Press.
[00:29:58.512 --> 00:29:58.993]  Today.
[00:30:00.475 --> 00:30:01.236]  Detroit News.
[00:30:01.296 --> 00:30:01.777]  Treasury.
[00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:02.117]  U.S.
[00:30:02.137 --> 00:30:04.240]  to lose $25 billion on auto bailout.
[00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:07.663]  To General Motors, who they paid to move to China and Brazil.
[00:30:08.003 --> 00:30:09.264]  Incredible treachery.
[00:30:09.664 --> 00:30:13.086]  Obama now shutting down, as promised, one-third of U.S.
[00:30:13.386 --> 00:30:14.266]  coal power plants.
[00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:17.868]  I mean, rolling blackouts, massive power increases.
[00:30:17.928 --> 00:30:19.189]  A foreign army couldn't do this.
[00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:22.211]  But you gotta break things down to loot it.
[00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:26.599]  Um, maybe he's been learning from Mitt Romney, Obama has.
[00:30:27.099 --> 00:30:29.882]  Summer of gloom for crisis hit Rome shops.
[00:30:30.503 --> 00:30:34.006]  This is just some of the news that we have here.
[00:30:34.387 --> 00:30:35.488]  Now, who broke it down?
[00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:52.702]  If you go back to three and a half years ago, one of our main experts in the Obama deception, and then six months after that, Fall of the Republic, as we tried to warn people then, these two preeminent films that, by the way, are free online at YouTube, they're trying to take them down right now.
[00:30:52.762 --> 00:30:55.425]  We've fought fake strikes and things to get them back up.
[00:30:56.085 --> 00:30:59.828]  But the other days, I think more and more knock on wood, are limited.
[00:31:00.428 --> 00:31:04.732]  You can get it right now, by the way, I should add, at InfoWarshop.com for $5.
[00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:10.657]  We lose money on that price when you count what went into this film.
[00:31:10.978 --> 00:31:13.881]  Get it, show it to people, because it isn't really about Obama.
[00:31:14.181 --> 00:31:24.632]  It's about the global banking oligarchy imploding the world economy to consolidate it, but getting so out of hand in their greed that they've even lost control, many economists and experts believe.
[00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:27.935]  Dr. Tarpley is a doctor of history, but also he is an economist.
[00:31:28.195 --> 00:31:34.180]  We're going to be speaking to him in a moment about this because I totally agree with his analysis on the problem.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:44.169]  We debate sometimes on the solution because big government solutions almost always get taken over and used by oligarchs, by the crony, monopoly men inside.
[00:31:44.229 --> 00:31:45.670]  But before we get to all that...
[00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:51.494]  He certainly knows how to forecast and gauge what's happening with a stunning accuracy.
[00:31:51.794 --> 00:32:02.261]  So we've got him for a full 60 minutes, starting when I go to him, to break down the current state of the world economically, war, how that ties in.
[00:32:02.281 --> 00:32:10.006]  He's been to Libya, been to Syria, the admission now that Al-Qaeda, the CFR last week praised Al-Qaeda and said, quote, we need them.
[00:32:10.546 --> 00:32:11.327]  They're heroes.
[00:32:11.728 --> 00:32:12.329]  We need them.
[00:32:13.191 --> 00:32:14.272]  They're so good.
[00:32:14.994 --> 00:32:17.938]  But I thought the TSA had to go in my pants to find Bin Laden.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.823]  But now they say, no, no, no, domestic groups.
[00:32:21.204 --> 00:32:22.186]  They're the terrorists.
[00:32:23.177 --> 00:32:27.979]  So we're going to be going over all of this, because the world is getting more and more insane.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.882]  And now when you start hearing him talk about imminent collapse of the Euro, and then the dollar, and J.P.
[00:32:33.922 --> 00:32:43.207]  Morgan, and all of this, to give us the real state of the world financial system, to give us a real breakdown on it, Webster Tarpley joins us.
[00:32:43.247 --> 00:32:52.231]  And then in the second half of the interview, after he gives us the geopolitical current breakdown, I'm going to sit back and try to ask very few questions and give him the floor.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:58.383]  In the second half to roll through his ideas for a solution.
[00:32:58.783 --> 00:33:01.365]  Now some of you are more constitutional or libertarian.
[00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:11.912]  You know, you're not going to like kind of the FDR style ideas, but I promised to just put these ideas out there because Tarpley, who I respect when it comes to his analysis, thinks this is the only solution.
[00:33:11.932 --> 00:33:16.815]  That does not mean I'm endorsing it, but I'm not scared to hear other ideas.
[00:33:17.376 --> 00:33:22.459]  And at the end of the interview, I'll write a few notes and I'll have some counterpoints to what Webster is saying.
[00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:23.260]  But undoubtedly,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:32.127]  The Republican leadership doesn't tell you about the majority of where the money's going, and that's the corporate welfare and inside crony scams.
[00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:37.231]  They want to point all day at the welfare crowd, when they've already shipped their jobs overseas.
[00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:43.096]  So Tarpley's right on that front, and he predicted much of what unfolded with Rand Paul a few weeks before it did unfold.
[00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:47.180]  And was proven right on that front to a great extent.
[00:33:48.181 --> 00:33:51.964]  So he joins us now from right outside DC in Maryland.
[00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:54.306]  Dr. Tarpley, great to have you here.
[00:33:54.326 --> 00:33:55.427]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:33:55.648 --> 00:33:55.988]  Thank you.
[00:33:56.028 --> 00:33:57.890]  Let the 60 Minutes begin.
[00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:07.119]  Give us your forecast, your breakdown, the waterfront of what's happening in the world today and the fact that now, headline after headline,
[00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.901]  Chinese pulling money out of the stock market.
[00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:11.162]  Global implosion.
[00:34:11.442 --> 00:34:13.024]  Banks told get ready for implosion.
[00:34:13.464 --> 00:34:14.285]  What's happening?
[00:34:16.323 --> 00:34:22.508]  Well, the starting point is the big reality is a world economic depression.
[00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:30.794]  It's a world economic depression similar to that of the 1930s, but in many ways worse than what we had in the 1930s.
[00:34:31.915 --> 00:34:36.799]  We've been in a depressed world economy in that sense since 2008 at the very latest, right?
[00:34:40.351 --> 00:34:45.135]  2008, the Lehman Brothers weekend around September 15th.
[00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:57.987]  This had been signaled by the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns back in the springtime in March, but then by the time we got to September, it's clear that every bank in Wall Street
[00:34:59.007 --> 00:35:00.088]  And we saw them all, right?
[00:35:00.128 --> 00:35:15.815]  We saw AIG, we saw Merrill Lynch, we saw every bank essentially bailed out, given treasury money through the tarp, but then given even more in 0% Federal Reserve loans, and that included foreign banks, right?
[00:35:15.855 --> 00:35:20.817]  Up to the tune of 25 or 27 trillion dollars.
[00:35:21.817 --> 00:35:23.238]  And since then we've had various
[00:35:23.958 --> 00:35:42.708]  Initiatives going on mainly that if you're a zombie bank or a hedge fund hyena you can go to the Federal Reserve and you can borrow at 0% interest rates in the United States or 1% similarly if you're a zombie bank in Europe you can go to the European Central Bank and get money for 1%
[00:35:44.102 --> 00:36:04.666]  But the problem with this is this has not produced a recovery because all of that credit is being absorbed by this mass, this cancerous growth of about two quadrillion dollars, that is to say two thousand trillion dollars of bankrupt, kited derivatives
[00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:05.871]  That's good.
[00:36:24.612 --> 00:36:25.773]  We're good to go.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.142]  And now, in the meantime, we've also seen the corruption, right?
[00:36:49.242 --> 00:37:01.189]  LIBOR, the LIBOR fixing scandal, which goes back to 07-08 but continues probably up to the present day, that is about 16 of the very biggest banks in the world.
[00:37:01.229 --> 00:37:09.233]  That essentially shows that you're dealing with a cartel, you're dealing with a world banking cartel of 16 or thereabouts
[00:37:11.994 --> 00:37:14.175]  Large zombie banks.
[00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:19.876]  I say zombie banks because they're all bankrupt and they're all kept going using government resources.
[00:37:20.256 --> 00:37:23.757]  But the problem is they don't have any positive social function anymore.
[00:37:24.217 --> 00:37:28.118]  They don't issue loans for commercial banking purposes.
[00:37:28.158 --> 00:37:33.499]  They don't do anything for plant equipment, business investments, capital formation, and so forth.
[00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:38.440]  What they do is speculate, they drive up the price of gasoline, they drive up the price of
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.061]  We're in the middle of this.
[00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:43.503]  Now, if you look at the responses of the ruling class, I think it's pretty clear
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:09.686]  There's a growing consensus in the world ruling class, I mean the kind of people who come together at Bilderberg or the people who control the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve and things like this.
[00:38:11.176 --> 00:38:12.958]  And the political parties, needless to say.
[00:38:13.098 --> 00:38:15.419]  Obama is a creature of Wall Street.
[00:38:15.439 --> 00:38:16.540]  He's a Wall Street puppet.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:30.888]  And then we have the new combination, the Romney-Ryan combination, which they intend to carry forward the Wall Street program with, I think, even greater criminal energy, even greater aggressiveness, right?
[00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:35.130]  Because they want to show that they're new and they're full of fight, right?
[00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.731]  And they want to flay the U.S.
[00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:37.692]  population alive.
[00:38:38.252 --> 00:38:41.415]  The consensus that I can see is austerity.
[00:38:41.435 --> 00:38:43.076]  And austerity means cuts.
[00:38:43.336 --> 00:38:49.462]  It means a psychosis that when you're in a depression, you've got to cut budgets.
[00:38:49.942 --> 00:38:52.224]  You've got to destroy the social safety net.
[00:38:52.264 --> 00:38:55.046]  You've got to strip people of their economic rights.
[00:38:56.267 --> 00:39:09.273]  And as you can see in Europe, right, you look at the conditions that were dictated to Greece, but also Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy is now coming, Greece also.
[00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:18.197]  All of this amounts to essentially posing the question, we have a depression, who should pay for the depression?
[00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:21.278]  This is the only real political question that we have.
[00:39:21.758 --> 00:39:23.599]  And the answer from the ruling class is,
[00:39:24.352 --> 00:39:26.273]  Working people pay for the depression.
[00:39:26.673 --> 00:39:28.814]  The middle class pays for the depression.
[00:39:28.874 --> 00:39:30.174]  The upper middle class even.
[00:39:31.735 --> 00:39:36.537]  Poor people, working people, working class people, that's who pays for the depression.
[00:39:36.597 --> 00:39:40.538]  And I would say that answer means genocide.
[00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:41.538]  Sure, sure.
[00:39:41.558 --> 00:39:45.340]  Let me just now interject a point because you've made so many.
[00:39:46.178 --> 00:39:55.547]  They phrase it in the right-wing, left-wing debate, though, that if you say, don't make the poor or the middle class pay, oh, you want rich people to have higher taxes to pay for your free welfare.
[00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:56.808]  That's not what's happening.
[00:39:57.248 --> 00:40:02.473]  In the Obama deception, you go over the first banker bailout numbers, and this was even in mainstream news, back of the paper.
[00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:23.507]  Where you'd have over 90% of it was corporate welfare and bailouts to the ultra-rich, but somehow since then they've spun it, even though in Europe it's mainly their fake debts that they got government to sign on to, too big to fail, to where, oh, it's those lazy French, or those lazy Germans, or those lazy Greeks, when they're working very hard over there.
[00:40:23.547 --> 00:40:28.330]  Sure, they may get a week more of vacation than us, we get two, three weeks, they get four, but the point is,
[00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:38.475]  Is that it's incredible for somebody like myself, who pays some attention to economics and what's really going on, that they've done such a good job of scapegoating people.
[00:40:38.535 --> 00:40:47.560]  But as you point out, when they get the austerity in, in Greece or Argentina or wherever they've done in the last 15 years, it implodes the tax revenue.
[00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:56.806]  So the bankers, that's why I say it's on purpose, they know that when they raise taxes on the poor or cut benefits or the middle class,
[00:40:57.586 --> 00:40:59.248]  That it actually drives down tax receipts.
[00:40:59.328 --> 00:41:02.552]  So, why do they want to drive things into oblivion?
[00:41:02.812 --> 00:41:13.224]  I mean, right there, Max Keiser ran into Steve Forbes in Greece a few months ago during a bunch of rioting, and he was there at a conference bragging, oh, things are imploding, we're buying everything up cheap.
[00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.787]  So, I mean, doesn't that show they know what they're doing?
[00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:17.759]  No, I don't think it does.
[00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:23.163]  I think that's sort of a commentary on the backside of accomplished fact, right?
[00:41:23.183 --> 00:41:27.507]  That's the wisdom that comes after the fait accompli.
[00:41:27.607 --> 00:41:28.227]  Hindsight's 20-20.
[00:41:28.367 --> 00:41:28.748]  Yeah.
[00:41:29.568 --> 00:41:34.953]  The problem that you have is when you have a speculative-minded
[00:41:35.686 --> 00:41:35.926]  I think so.
[00:41:53.693 --> 00:41:55.773]  Which, in our time, means, of course, derivatives.
[00:41:56.174 --> 00:42:00.494]  These, again, the collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, and all the rest of this.
[00:42:00.514 --> 00:42:02.635]  They think that that actually represents wealth.
[00:42:03.055 --> 00:42:06.896]  Sure, they want post-industrial world, and they say they do.
[00:42:06.936 --> 00:42:10.837]  In fact, it's not that they're not at the level of Henry Ford or Carnegie with steel and coke.
[00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:12.637]  They know what they're doing.
[00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:14.657]  They're at odds against production.
[00:42:14.917 --> 00:42:18.318]  Henry Ford wanted to pay the workers well so they could buy his car.
[00:42:18.558 --> 00:42:19.618]  He wanted an economy.
[00:42:19.899 --> 00:42:21.359]  They want the post-industrial.
[00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:21.979]  Why is that?
[00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:24.482]  Well, again, let's not be too nice to Henry Ford.
[00:42:24.502 --> 00:42:25.283]  He financed Hitler.
[00:42:25.303 --> 00:42:26.364]  He did a lot of very bad things.
[00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:29.388]  But I wasn't praising him on the Hitler thing, Tarpley.
[00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:31.830]  I was stating that he understood you've got to have a market.
[00:42:32.351 --> 00:42:34.093]  At least sometimes he did, right?
[00:42:34.233 --> 00:42:37.818]  And I think, unfortunately, as he went along, he understood it less and less.
[00:42:38.158 --> 00:42:38.759]  But the idea is,
[00:42:39.479 --> 00:42:46.721]  The power of an industrialist faction, you don't really see this in the US, you see it in China, you might even see it in Japan.
[00:42:47.441 --> 00:42:52.483]  In Russia, you see a lot of people who are industrialists, even if it's extractive industries, but not here.
[00:42:52.843 --> 00:42:58.444]  The Anglo-Americans have built their house on speculative paper, and that means derivatives.
[00:42:58.504 --> 00:43:01.825]  Now, the problem that they have is, they live for the next bubble.
[00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:04.107]  We saw it with Greenspan, right?
[00:43:04.147 --> 00:43:05.048]  Bubbles Greenspan.
[00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:18.543]  He went from the irrational exuberance of the wealth effect, the housing bubble, then we had the Latin American loan bubble before that, then we had the dot-com bubble, then we went back to the housing bubble.
[00:43:19.415 --> 00:43:23.157]  They feel that they can't make their system work without a series of bubbles.
[00:43:23.477 --> 00:43:26.038]  And once they see a bubble, it's like a heroin addict.
[00:43:26.178 --> 00:43:28.299]  I don't think there's any element of calculation.
[00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:37.583]  This is a very important point, because what I'm saying is that this ruling class, this is a highly political question, this ruling class is incompetent.
[00:43:37.883 --> 00:43:39.504]  They are incapable of ruling.
[00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:43.527]  And if you want to do anything serious, you've got to face that problem.
[00:43:43.827 --> 00:43:53.914]  Your ultimate bedrock problem is not even this policy or that policy, but you've got to take power out of the hands of a ruling elite, of financiers.
[00:43:54.014 --> 00:43:55.015]  Sure, so let me stop you.
[00:43:55.035 --> 00:43:58.057]  I mean, I always hear the demonization of industrialists, but that sounds great.
[00:43:58.097 --> 00:44:04.722]  That's jobs, that's building things up, that's farms, that's mobility, that's all sorts of people to work on the machines.
[00:44:05.382 --> 00:44:27.099]  But, I mean, so basically what you're saying is, correct me if I'm wrong, is they've created a cosmology of post-industrial where they've romanticized wrecking societies because they are out of control like cancer, that's what they do, and so they lie and say, oh, that was our plan to wreck everything, and have believed their own delusion?
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.724]  They're shameless opportunists, and Steve Forbes, you know, the toothy geek,
[00:44:33.144 --> 00:44:34.165]  As he was once called, right?
[00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:35.306]  Presidential candidate.
[00:44:35.726 --> 00:44:41.951]  He ran on a tax plan that would have essentially, you know, given a free ride to rich parasites like himself.
[00:44:42.251 --> 00:44:44.353]  This is also somebody who inherited the money, right?
[00:44:44.553 --> 00:44:54.361]  The money was made by Malcolm Forbes, so this is now a no-talent, you know, idiot son who arrives and takes over the company and spent a lot trying to become president.
[00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.762]  Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:44:55.802 --> 00:44:57.744]  Steve Forbes in the publishing world is doing
[00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.792]  Really better than most people right now.
[00:45:01.892 --> 00:45:05.355]  Yeah, he probably hired some people who know what to do, because he certainly doesn't.
[00:45:05.675 --> 00:45:10.658]  Anyway, the point is, what Steve Forbes was doing over there was, the U.S.
[00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:14.541]  essentially succeeded in exporting this depression to Europe.
[00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:16.322]  There is no European debt crisis.
[00:45:16.682 --> 00:45:20.665]  The answer to the European debt crisis, and I think you were getting close to this before,
[00:45:21.474 --> 00:45:34.358]  If Deutsche Bank or Societe Generale or Barclays Bank bought Greek bonds and Greece can't pay, that's too bad for Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and Barclays Bank.
[00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.278]  They go bankrupt.
[00:45:35.658 --> 00:45:37.499]  Except they can't because they're too big to fail.
[00:45:37.939 --> 00:45:50.269]  So what we have in Europe is the triumph of neoliberal, monetarist ideology, which says that if Greece can't pay, then Greeks have to die, right?
[00:45:50.289 --> 00:46:01.177]  They have to be killed through austerity, take away their health care, they die, take away their unemployment benefits, their food subsidies, they die, and a lot of them are also killing themselves, right?
[00:46:01.318 --> 00:46:04.260]  In Greece and Italy, you can see that the ultimate
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.122]  Listen, we're gonna get into all that, but I specifically
[00:46:22.236 --> 00:46:29.178]  And I'm going to give you the floor to break down what you think are the solutions here, Webster, but I want to get into, you mentioned things like LIBOR.
[00:46:29.218 --> 00:46:40.360]  The average person has heard of that, interest rate fixing, but the magnitude, this confirms everything we were saying, that they were fixing it for free money for themselves to loan shark and gouge.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.622]  I want to talk about LIBOR, but also what does it signify that now for the first time
[00:46:47.442 --> 00:47:00.206]  They are all over every elite publication saying global meltdown, total collapse, 1.4 billion rounds of 40 cal hollow point dum-dum bullets, drones, troops.
[00:47:00.506 --> 00:47:04.588]  I mean, for the first time, they're going from denying all this to gearing it up.
[00:47:04.608 --> 00:47:07.329]  Does that, A, mean they're getting ready for the collapse?
[00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:13.491]  Or, B, are they getting ready to hold people hostage again like Paulson did in October of 2008?
[00:47:16.552 --> 00:47:38.202]  Well, the first thing, of course, is that the basic reality is that if you have a world economic depression of these proportions, right, and it now exists in the United States, in North America, I think pretty much in general, it certainly has come to Europe,
[00:47:39.243 --> 00:47:40.364]  China is slowing.
[00:47:40.564 --> 00:47:41.284]  India is slowing.
[00:47:41.324 --> 00:47:43.005]  They haven't been quite as bad.
[00:47:43.325 --> 00:47:48.387]  You can see that the whole Mediterranean basin, the Arab world, is in deep distress.
[00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:54.790]  The high unemployment and high food prices are really the basis of the fraud called the Arab Spring.
[00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:55.730]  So, yeah.
[00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.313]  If you don't deal with the depression, civilization will collapse, right?
[00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:07.921]  In other words, everything that you've mentioned, those are simply predicates of the fact that if you have a depression, and it goes on and on and on, civilization will collapse.
[00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:13.426]  The institutions upon which human society depends will be wiped out.
[00:48:13.506 --> 00:48:17.470]  Now, LIBOR, again, it simply means that there's a cartel.
[00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:25.113]  That this interest rate that was reported every morning was doctored, it was fixed, it was done for different reasons.
[00:48:25.314 --> 00:48:29.095]  Sometimes they wanted it higher than it really was, sometimes they wanted it lower.
[00:48:29.756 --> 00:48:40.361]  There are about 600 trillion or 800 trillion dollars of derivatives around the world, including Eurodollar derivatives, that depend on that London Interbank offered rate.
[00:48:41.904 --> 00:48:44.987]  And people who invested in that have been ripped off, right?
[00:48:45.007 --> 00:48:51.815]  The city of Baltimore is suing for $50 billion, and there are all kinds of other lawsuits.
[00:48:52.435 --> 00:48:56.320]  I think, though, what we have to focus on is events in the real economy.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:02.567]  In other words, consumption, employment, wages, human longevity, things like this.
[00:49:03.387 --> 00:49:06.489]  The idea that there's going to be another financial panic?
[00:49:06.849 --> 00:49:10.751]  Yeah, of course, a financial panic could emerge at any point.
[00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:17.854]  I would also say that a lot of the stuff that you cite, these articles have an axe to grind, they have a bias.
[00:49:18.754 --> 00:49:22.556]  Anybody in Britain or the United States who writes about the Euro,
[00:49:23.371 --> 00:49:30.314]  Or tells you that the euro is going to crash, is part of a, whether they know it or not, they're part of an effort to destroy the euro.
[00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:33.535]  In other words, it's a way to export the depression, right?
[00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:35.916]  It started in 2009, right?
[00:49:35.936 --> 00:49:39.157]  Basically, Christina Romer had studied these things.
[00:49:39.797 --> 00:49:40.177]  We're good.
[00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:03.667]  Yes, of course, there could be a cataclysmic financial panic at any moment.
[00:50:03.727 --> 00:50:06.350]  Any kind of an outside event could do that.
[00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:23.776]  I'm not so interested in the financial aggregates.
[00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:28.679]  I'm interested in the fate of human beings and of the society.
[00:50:28.699 --> 00:50:29.920]  And here's what I'm getting at.
[00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:35.464]  There's a group in the United States of about 50 million people.
[00:50:35.484 --> 00:50:37.066]  5-0 million.
[00:50:37.926 --> 00:50:42.850]  And this group is now in grave danger of genocide.
[00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.992]  In other words, death on a mass scale.
[00:50:46.753 --> 00:50:47.934]  And here's the way it looks.
[00:50:48.522 --> 00:50:52.085]  The $50 million, first of all, don't have jobs.
[00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:54.127]  Because there are no jobs, right?
[00:50:54.907 --> 00:51:00.652]  My estimate of the real unemployment in the United States is about $30 million plus.
[00:51:01.213 --> 00:51:09.720]  If you take the Department of Labor U6 unemployment, you get up to about $23 million or so.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.822]  I think $30 million is a good round number.
[00:51:12.555 --> 00:51:16.260]  It's interesting, this was taken up by this guy Dylan Radigan on MSNBC.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.767]  For what reason, I don't know, but after I'd been saying 30 million for quite a while, he picked it up.
[00:51:21.887 --> 00:51:22.928]  No, no, I'm sure I agree with you.
[00:51:22.948 --> 00:51:29.957]  I want to go over some of those real numbers, but just to be clear, when I read five or six headlines here, that was on an attempt to
[00:51:31.357 --> 00:51:37.419]  I was giving you a smattering at the start of the interview of the fact that they're admitting the crisis is deepening.
[00:51:37.439 --> 00:51:39.939]  Let me just go over some of those again since you mentioned it.
[00:51:40.459 --> 00:51:44.080]  Chicago Tribune running Reuters, in the U.S.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.381]  they're saying prepare to, quote, prevent a collapse during a collapse.
[00:51:49.181 --> 00:51:56.283]  And then I showed Der Spiegel investors prepare for euro collapse.
[00:51:57.245 --> 00:51:59.807]  Okay, so more and more they're saying there's no way to mail that.
[00:52:00.167 --> 00:52:05.551]  Spiegel, Spiegel, notorious British intelligence rag from Hamburg.
[00:52:05.591 --> 00:52:07.292]  Centre of British influence.
[00:52:07.312 --> 00:52:07.732]  I understand.
[00:52:07.752 --> 00:52:09.453]  I'm just going over... I know these people.
[00:52:09.753 --> 00:52:11.555]  I probably know who wrote it.
[00:52:11.575 --> 00:52:12.175]  I'm not sure.
[00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.516]  Okay, let me tell you who wrote it.
[00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:14.637]  Martin Hess.
[00:52:15.598 --> 00:52:16.158]  Martin has.
[00:52:16.218 --> 00:52:16.998]  No, I don't know.
[00:52:17.018 --> 00:52:18.339]  Okay, continuing.
[00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:19.539]  It was a smattering of headlines.
[00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:20.620]  There wasn't some code in it.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.660]  I just grabbed these off my desk.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.360]  I covered it on the radio.
[00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:24.041]  Here's another one.
[00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:25.821]  Chinese companies pull out of U.S.
[00:52:25.861 --> 00:52:26.421]  stock market.
[00:52:26.802 --> 00:52:27.602]  I see that as big.
[00:52:27.622 --> 00:52:29.002]  They're not buying as many as our treasurers.
[00:52:29.482 --> 00:52:31.583]  This could also reflect the weakness of China.
[00:52:31.603 --> 00:52:34.524]  In other words, they may be leaving because they've got plenty to do.
[00:52:34.804 --> 00:52:36.885]  I'm hearing a lot of that from people that are smart like you.
[00:52:36.905 --> 00:52:37.466]  Okay, here's another one.
[00:52:37.866 --> 00:52:40.027]  Treasury, you know, losses on bailouts.
[00:52:40.468 --> 00:52:42.769]  I'm just trying to, you know, roam shops in trouble.
[00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:48.413]  I mean, my point is they've been papering over things, saying everything worldwide is wonderful.
[00:52:48.733 --> 00:52:50.674]  The recession ended almost four years ago.
[00:52:51.055 --> 00:52:52.796]  You and others said that's boulderdash.
[00:52:53.216 --> 00:52:54.397]  It's been admitted boulderdash.
[00:52:54.417 --> 00:52:55.858]  They're fixing unemployment numbers.
[00:52:56.198 --> 00:52:59.040]  They're fixing numbers on inflation.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.281]  That's all admitted.
[00:53:01.338 --> 00:53:05.160]  My question was, hey, they're admitting things are getting really bad.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.001]  Why are they doing that?
[00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:09.102]  I know they've got axes to grind.
[00:53:09.382 --> 00:53:10.403]  I was asking you why.
[00:53:10.423 --> 00:53:16.906]  There's a constant process of admitting, right, that there's a depression.
[00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:17.826]  Let's take that one, right?
[00:53:17.866 --> 00:53:19.767]  The most obvious is, is there a depression?
[00:53:19.847 --> 00:53:20.067]  Yes.
[00:53:20.908 --> 00:53:23.369]  Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner.
[00:53:24.142 --> 00:53:24.462]  I think so.
[00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:54.015]  There's a depression, and then within the depression, and that has never changed, you never got out of the depression, there's no recovery, it's not a recession, it's a depression, there hasn't been a recovery, but there are attempts to create bubbles within the depression.
[00:53:54.939 --> 00:54:02.404]  And what we're talking about now is, will there be another collapse of a new derivatives bubble?
[00:54:02.424 --> 00:54:03.805]  And that's why we've got you here.
[00:54:05.185 --> 00:54:06.866]  I want to get into this with you right now here.
[00:54:06.886 --> 00:54:08.087]  This is complex issues.
[00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:09.968]  What are the new bubbles?
[00:54:10.088 --> 00:54:14.611]  Obviously food, farmland, things like that, military stuff.
[00:54:14.931 --> 00:54:15.992]  What are the new bubbles?
[00:54:16.472 --> 00:54:18.954]  And what do you expect to be the different breakpoints?
[00:54:19.115 --> 00:54:21.276]  I know it's hard to tell because they're not even in full control.
[00:54:21.697 --> 00:54:23.679]  But what are you looking at?
[00:54:24.179 --> 00:54:25.420]  What do you see happening?
[00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:30.965]  Well, whenever there are objective reasons, for example, the U.S.
[00:54:31.025 --> 00:54:33.948]  drought and similar things around the world, it's
[00:54:34.958 --> 00:54:38.920]  An objective basis to cover a wave of speculation, right?
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:43.221]  So as soon as something like this happens, the speculators come in and they make everything worse.
[00:54:44.242 --> 00:54:45.862]  And they use derivatives, right?
[00:54:45.902 --> 00:54:52.785]  They use various kinds of commodity index derivatives and synthetic derivatives.
[00:54:52.805 --> 00:54:55.526]  Naked shorting, computers, flash trading.
[00:54:55.926 --> 00:54:56.886]  Yeah, derivatives.
[00:54:56.926 --> 00:55:01.168]  So the obvious one is the oil price, right?
[00:55:01.188 --> 00:55:03.629]  There's a general idea that the oil price can only go up.
[00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:10.535]  So, it's generally estimated that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley between them account for...
[00:55:11.713 --> 00:55:19.375]  Maybe $10 or $15 of the price of a barrel of oil, right, which is now in the 80s.
[00:55:19.935 --> 00:55:23.436]  By the way, if you want to deal with that, that's something you can deal with very, very specifically.
[00:55:23.876 --> 00:55:27.538]  You can ban these commodity derivatives.
[00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:28.638]  You just outlaw them.
[00:55:29.058 --> 00:55:30.378]  You have position limits.
[00:55:30.398 --> 00:55:36.040]  It says if you want to enter the oil market, you can buy 5% of the oil market, no more.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.641]  You have to distinguish between end users and spec
[00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:40.841]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:55:41.021 --> 00:55:45.103]  I mean, these speculators want new taxes for me to pay them banker bailouts.
[00:55:46.303 --> 00:55:52.666]  I want to get into solutions, but let's talk about some of them now, but I've got a few more questions before we get into that whole diatribe, because I want you to have the floor on that.
[00:55:52.686 --> 00:55:54.466]  The big one is obviously derivatives.
[00:55:54.506 --> 00:55:58.648]  In other words, the derivatives, you know, they haven't gone down, they've gone up.
[00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:05.370]  At the time of the crisis, I was estimating... Sure, they use bailout money to engage in more speculation.
[00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:06.051]  So what do you do, a 1% tax?
[00:56:07.838 --> 00:56:11.081]  Yeah, look, again with derivatives, it's very specific.
[00:56:11.422 --> 00:56:12.423]  Some you ban.
[00:56:13.223 --> 00:56:15.325]  Let's take collateralized debt obligations.
[00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:32.701]  If you remember, a year ago this spring, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs appeared before the Senate, right, when Senator Levin was reading this thing about, this obscene report about, you know, what a piece of crap
[00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:35.323]  These CDOs were that he was selling.
[00:56:35.643 --> 00:56:43.669]  At the end of the day, in one of his TV interviews, even Blankhorn said, maybe we should just outlaw credit default swaps.
[00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:44.890]  Yes, exactly.
[00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.891]  Outlaw credit default swaps.
[00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:47.712]  You ban them.
[00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:51.375]  They were illegal in the United States from 1936 to 1982 under the Commodity Exchange Act.
[00:56:54.637 --> 00:56:57.660]  This is the series of New Deal things that prevented the Depression.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:03.904]  Sure, Webster, I want you to stop because in ten minutes we go to the half hour where I'm giving you solutions.
[00:57:03.964 --> 00:57:06.026]  I'm not going to talk about solutions.
[00:57:06.066 --> 00:57:09.269]  I'm just saying, even Blankfein said you can ban them, right?
[00:57:09.669 --> 00:57:12.151]  Stop, stop, stop.
[00:57:12.411 --> 00:57:18.776]  I want to get into solutions and your ideas because I respect them, but I want to stop there before I run out of time here.
[00:57:18.796 --> 00:57:19.457]  This is riveting.
[00:57:20.297 --> 00:57:24.203]  Let's go here, because most shows don't have these big long in-depth interviews.
[00:57:25.064 --> 00:57:27.988]  How does war, how does Al Qaeda, how does trying to get...
[00:57:29.233 --> 00:57:31.615]  Shiites and Sunnis into a global civil war.
[00:57:32.035 --> 00:57:33.296]  How does that feed in?
[00:57:33.576 --> 00:57:37.558]  Because obviously there's not just economics, there's warfare, there's other ingredients.
[00:57:37.618 --> 00:57:39.820]  So, you've been to these countries just recently.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.322]  You've been there under bombardment in Libya and in war zones in Syria.
[00:57:43.342 --> 00:57:46.124]  We respect your courage on that front more than I have.
[00:57:46.884 --> 00:57:51.908]  Tell us how that feeds in, because you know how to look over the horizon.
[00:57:52.948 --> 00:57:58.730]  What do you expect to happen geopolitically, or what are some of the storm clouds we should look to form?
[00:57:58.770 --> 00:57:59.670]  I mean, I want to know this.
[00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.271]  The viewers want to know.
[00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:13.595]  Break down some of the different futures you see, and then I'm going to sit back, buddy, for 30 minutes, in about 8 minutes, I'm looking at the clock over there, and tell us what you would do solution-wise.
[00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:16.316]  I hope you've got a raft of notes there, because you're going to have the floor.
[00:58:18.227 --> 00:58:31.001]  The foreign policy approach is that the US and the British and similar, you know, Frankfurt and Paris and what have you, they have to loot the world.
[00:58:31.081 --> 00:58:37.428]  They have to sack and loot and exploit this planet and humanity on the planet.
[00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:44.254]  And the problem that they always have is you can work through puppet states in, you know, Europe, right?
[00:58:44.294 --> 00:58:47.256]  There were no real independent countries left in Europe.
[00:58:47.276 --> 00:58:53.821]  They've all knuckled under to NATO and the European Central Bank, which gets you back to London and Wall Street.
[00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:58.744]  But in other parts of the world, there are nation states that fight back.
[00:58:58.944 --> 00:59:04.828]  And the nation state is the absolutely essential way you fight these neo-feudalist
[00:59:05.328 --> 00:59:06.369]  We're good to go.
[00:59:35.603 --> 00:59:40.605]  The IMF comes in and says, abolish the food subsidy, go to a free market in bread.
[00:59:40.946 --> 00:59:43.247]  Well, that's going to quadruple the price of bread.
[00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:44.087]  There are going to be riots.
[00:59:44.107 --> 00:59:45.308]  So Mubarak says no.
[00:59:46.548 --> 00:59:47.528]  Similar things like this.
[00:59:48.269 --> 00:59:55.892]  The nation state tends to erect a barrier against the amount of looting that the foreign bankers can impose.
[00:59:56.172 --> 00:59:58.974]  The nation state is a firewall.
[00:59:59.014 --> 01:00:00.374]  The nation state is a firewall.
[01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:01.515]  Absolutely.
[01:00:01.535 --> 01:00:02.555]  And it's true for us too.
[01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:04.376]  You can see this in Brzezinski.
[01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:05.951]  We're good to go.
[01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.460]  Not Syria, but a micro-state.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.744]  There's an editorial about that in the Washington Post this morning.
[01:00:29.605 --> 01:00:34.670]  If you're a Lebanese Maronite, there's got to be a special state for you.
[01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.913]  If you're a Kurd, there's got to be Kurdistan for you.
[01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:39.794]  So divide and conquer the great game.
[01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:41.095]  Divide and conquer.
[01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:44.939]  And Soros calls it partition studies.
[01:00:45.566 --> 01:00:47.528]  In other words, there's a whole academic discipline.
[01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:56.438]  How do you destroy the modern nation-state and replace it with these rump states, microstates, mini-states, failed states?
[01:00:56.458 --> 01:01:05.968]  And that's what multiculturalism is, is trying to get us all fighting with each other, and then the establishment plays the part of the gatekeeper, the arbiter, the referee.
[01:01:06.508 --> 01:01:06.708]  Right.
[01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:13.110]  The left-wing version is multiculturalism, but the right-wing version is secessionism, states' rights, all this stuff.
[01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:18.992]  Because you push that, you're going to get the breakup of the large nation-states.
[01:01:19.232 --> 01:01:21.353]  The British are doing this to themselves.
[01:01:21.753 --> 01:01:26.235]  They use the British Isles as a kind of a show window for their policies.
[01:01:27.015 --> 01:01:27.195]  Right?
[01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:38.725]  Scotland, if Scotland secedes from the United Kingdom, they're not really seceding because they'll still have the Queen as the head of state, the Bank of England or the Bank of Scotland, same thing, will run the show, right?
[01:01:38.765 --> 01:01:39.926]  They'll still be part of the IMF.
[01:01:40.146 --> 01:01:41.247]  They won't have sovereignty.
[01:01:41.287 --> 01:01:44.170]  They'll still be in the European Central Bank.
[01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:46.592]  They won't, you know, or European Union.
[01:01:46.872 --> 01:01:51.356]  They won't have sovereignty at all, but the idea is they'll be easier to deal with.
[01:01:51.556 --> 01:01:58.359]  You've got to imagine, if I'm JP Morgan Chase or Exxon Mobil or Halliburton, who do I want to deal with?
[01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:03.662]  Do I want to deal with Syria, which is a country of 25 million people with an army and an air force?
[01:02:03.942 --> 01:02:10.345]  Or do I want to deal with an independent Druze, Kurd, Alawite, Shiite entity?
[01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:12.206]  I'll deal with the little ones.
[01:02:12.246 --> 01:02:19.009]  In other words, the pathetic, little, squabbling, impotent things that have no hope of resisting when you play one against another.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.601]  And it just becomes an endless process.
[01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:23.661]  So that's the idea.
[01:02:24.321 --> 01:02:26.341]  But there's an economic reason for that.
[01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:27.882]  Look what they did in Libya, right?
[01:02:27.902 --> 01:02:28.962]  You destroy Libya.
[01:02:29.002 --> 01:02:30.322]  Libya is now a shambles.
[01:02:30.742 --> 01:02:37.864]  But the oil contracts have now been renegotiated under terms that are worse than what Gaddafi got.
[01:02:38.124 --> 01:02:43.425]  Worse for Libya, but better for the international multinational oil companies.
[01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:45.485]  Sure, so we get the looting briefly here then.
[01:02:45.525 --> 01:02:48.006]  How are things going geopolitically for the globalists?
[01:02:48.346 --> 01:02:49.987]  What are you expecting to do in Iran?
[01:02:50.607 --> 01:02:53.648]  Look, we just had a real big landmark event, right?
[01:02:53.688 --> 01:02:55.148]  That was last week.
[01:02:55.228 --> 01:02:58.790]  I think it must have been last Friday.
[01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:04.191]  It was the Tehran Consultative Conference on Syria.
[01:03:04.832 --> 01:03:06.572]  This was a landmark.
[01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:09.493]  I've never seen anything like this in recent decades.
[01:03:10.133 --> 01:03:13.114]  This is an international conference, and who's going to be there?
[01:03:13.154 --> 01:03:15.235]  Well, Iran are the hosts, so Iran.
[01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:19.902]  Russia, China, India are all represented.
[01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:21.463]  But it doesn't stop there.
[01:03:21.823 --> 01:03:31.290]  Pakistan, Mrs. Rabbani, the foreign minister, comes and she says, no foreign intervention in Syria, under no circumstances.
[01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:32.931]  Indonesia,
[01:03:33.823 --> 01:03:36.786]  You've already got about half the world, but it goes on.
[01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.008]  Then you've got Kazakhstan, huge place.
[01:03:39.389 --> 01:03:44.474]  Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, Belarus.
[01:03:45.014 --> 01:03:46.476]  It's 30 countries, 30.
[01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:50.219]  And they represent half the world.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.605]  Because you've got Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, big.
[01:03:56.428 --> 01:03:56.928]  Important.
[01:03:57.028 --> 01:03:57.528]  Venezuela.
[01:03:57.869 --> 01:03:58.489]  Influential country.
[01:03:58.509 --> 01:04:00.569]  They're not going to the controlled UN.
[01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:02.390]  They're setting up their own league.
[01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.410]  Yeah, in effect.
[01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:07.092]  And half of these people were at the ministerial level.
[01:04:07.712 --> 01:04:09.892]  You know, foreign minister, deputy foreign minister.
[01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:13.254]  The rest of them were ambassadors with some of the smaller countries, right?
[01:04:13.314 --> 01:04:18.335]  You know, smaller Latin American countries couldn't, they couldn't, you know, send somebody especially for this.
[01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:20.296]  But this was a real big thing.
[01:04:20.596 --> 01:04:23.517]  And I noticed that Hillary Clinton is more hysterical than ever.
[01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:28.695]  Because her job is supposed to be make sure nothing like that ever happens.
[01:04:29.195 --> 01:04:30.056]  And now it's happened.
[01:04:30.946 --> 01:04:38.632]  There's a kind of a, I would call it a block for national independence, for state sovereignty, and national dignity.
[01:04:38.772 --> 01:04:42.595]  An anti-New World Order, anti-genocide group.
[01:04:43.036 --> 01:04:44.176]  Right, yes, exactly.
[01:04:44.457 --> 01:04:47.599]  And it's a powerful combination.
[01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:55.025]  Now obviously there are a lot of problems and it needs to be developed, but it's a step beyond these things like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
[01:04:55.165 --> 01:04:55.625]  And BRICS.
[01:04:56.766 --> 01:04:57.906]  Listen, we're out of time.
[01:04:57.926 --> 01:04:59.867]  This is short-term and task-oriented.
[01:05:00.047 --> 01:05:00.867]  We're out of time.
[01:05:01.907 --> 01:05:03.567]  We've already done over 30 minutes here.
[01:05:03.988 --> 01:05:13.970]  So I want to sit back, get into what you would do if you could convince the electorate, or if you could get the electorate to do what you wanted, or you had a magic wand.
[01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:18.071]  What would you do geopolitically to stop the globalists?
[01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:19.571]  Because even if we had the votes,
[01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:22.616]  They would just stage terror attacks and blame it on us.
[01:05:23.137 --> 01:05:34.904]  So, how do you geopolitically, militarily, economically outmaneuver the globalists whose stated goal is bankrupt the world, bankrupt the family, and inject us all with cancer viruses?
[01:05:35.324 --> 01:05:37.566]  How do we, how do we deal with that?
[01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.588]  And for this we got about 30 minutes, right?
[01:05:40.748 --> 01:05:41.148]  Yeah, go!
[01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:41.548]  You got it.
[01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.269]  Okay.
[01:05:42.853 --> 01:05:46.036]  Well, the first thing is, you gotta have a mass movement.
[01:05:46.277 --> 01:05:49.019]  It's gotta be an independent mass movement.
[01:05:49.059 --> 01:05:52.343]  Without a mass movement, there's no solution, really, to anything.
[01:05:52.947 --> 01:05:55.529]  It's got to be independent of the Republican Party.
[01:05:55.689 --> 01:05:58.772]  Independent of every single politician in the Republican Party.
[01:05:58.832 --> 01:06:05.138]  And similarly, independent of the Democratic Party and independent of every single one of them.
[01:06:05.618 --> 01:06:10.782]  Now obviously, as time goes on, you're going to be getting pieces of those parties to come and join you.
[01:06:10.802 --> 01:06:12.924]  But the idea is, you're independent.
[01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:19.770]  And it's perfectly possible that at some point you might want to poach in the Democratic or Republican or anybody else's primary.
[01:06:21.232 --> 01:06:22.353]  But you need a mass movement.
[01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:28.518]  Now, let's look at an attempt in this direction that succeeded lately.
[01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:29.258]  Okay?
[01:06:29.298 --> 01:06:31.680]  We can think of all the ones that failed, right?
[01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:35.643]  Everything in the Republican primaries, Ron Paul, I think that failed.
[01:06:36.264 --> 01:06:49.734]  And you can also say then that the, on the other side, Occupy Wall Street was wrecked by ad busters and David Graeber and a bunch of anarchists and Michael Moore and these people who came in.
[01:06:50.365 --> 01:06:52.386]  The one that succeeded is Syriza, right?
[01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:54.888]  The left-wing block of Greece.
[01:06:54.948 --> 01:06:57.729]  They went from 4% to about 27-28%.
[01:06:57.789 --> 01:07:02.172]  So they had almost 600% growth.
[01:07:02.572 --> 01:07:09.056]  And they scared the living daylights out of the whole world financier ruling class between May and June.
[01:07:09.076 --> 01:07:11.917]  And so this is a very, very formidable thing.
[01:07:11.957 --> 01:07:13.578]  They're now the opposition in Greece.
[01:07:14.199 --> 01:07:16.000]  The news from Greece is all bad.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.201]  Austerity cuts.
[01:07:19.128 --> 01:07:22.690]  That are done with the promise that they're going to balance the budget.
[01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.351]  Never balance the budget.
[01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:25.692]  It can't be done that way.
[01:07:26.092 --> 01:07:33.536]  Everybody who proposes austerity, doesn't matter who it is, is selling snake oil because they say, carry out my cuts and we'll balance the budget.
[01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:34.537]  No, you never will.
[01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.198]  Because in a depression, you're just making it worse.
[01:07:37.258 --> 01:07:41.361]  And what the Greeks have found is that the deficit gets bigger and bigger.
[01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:43.802]  The more you cut this year, the bigger the deficit.
[01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:50.199]  Next year, because you're cutting the only activity that really exists is activity around the state sector.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.921]  So, that's that.
[01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:54.144]  Now Syriza, what can we learn from it?
[01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:56.487]  Five things, I think, what you need.
[01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:03.992]  First of all, you need a program, and I want to talk about program more than anything, but you've got to have an actual program of demands.
[01:08:04.312 --> 01:08:11.614]  Notice with the Occupy Wall Street, their idea was you should not have any demands.
[01:08:11.935 --> 01:08:13.675]  If you have demands, you're going to be co-opted.
[01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:15.816]  This is absolutely insane, right?
[01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:17.596]  This is absolute garbage.
[01:08:17.656 --> 01:08:22.718]  This is the kind of thing that a ruling class counterinsurgency agent
[01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:23.859]  Tells you to do.
[01:08:23.879 --> 01:08:26.340]  They usually come dressed as anarchists.
[01:08:26.461 --> 01:08:28.362]  So, you've got to have a program.
[01:08:28.382 --> 01:08:29.423]  You've got to have an identity.
[01:08:29.763 --> 01:08:41.612]  You've got to be able to talk to other people in the society and say, look, I'm not just doing this for my own narrow parochial interest, but I'm interested in fighting battles that will benefit the entire society.
[01:08:41.692 --> 01:08:43.593]  Okay, so we'll get to program in a minute.
[01:08:43.873 --> 01:08:45.955]  The second thing you need is an organization.
[01:08:46.996 --> 01:08:50.198]  The leadership of Syriza was able to put together
[01:08:50.922 --> 01:08:58.904]  Twelve different groups to make a political party to get to 4% in the beginning, right, to reach critical mass.
[01:08:59.284 --> 01:09:09.808]  So that meant sects, groups, organizations, splinter parties, pieces of old, you know, political formations that hadn't gone anywhere.
[01:09:10.208 --> 01:09:11.168]  Put them together
[01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:18.408]  That was obviously a big effort, because you had to convince people to give up their petty grievances and their feuds and all this other stuff.
[01:09:18.928 --> 01:09:24.150]  Naturally, the fact that the society was helping probably, was collapsing, probably helped.
[01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:26.070]  So, you gotta have an organization.
[01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:30.532]  You gotta have a leader, and it turned out, or a leadership, better.
[01:09:31.492 --> 01:09:36.214]  That's this guy, Alexis Tsipras, who proved to be a very, very gifted politician.
[01:09:36.254 --> 01:09:40.875]  He took the message to Paris, he took it to Berlin, he was able to get
[01:09:41.898 --> 01:09:56.671]  Political parties representing about 10 or 12 percent of the vote in France and in Germany to come on his side, and they can now form a faction in the European Parliament that can fight to take control of the European Central Bank, because in Europe you've got to do it internationally, right?
[01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:57.011]  U.S.
[01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:59.754]  is a little bit different, but not as different as you think.
[01:10:00.194 --> 01:10:05.639]  So we mentioned program, we mentioned an organization, we mentioned leadership,
[01:10:06.384 --> 01:10:09.987]  Uh, and then there's the question of having a strategy.
[01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:13.369]  And the strategy is sort of what I said before.
[01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:18.213]  Don't be sucked into the Republican Party or any Republican politician.
[01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:20.554]  Same thing for the Democrats, right?
[01:10:20.854 --> 01:10:21.435]  Keep yourself
[01:10:22.276 --> 01:10:25.578]  In terms of the integrity of your organization, you're separate from them.
[01:10:25.839 --> 01:10:27.861]  You're not them, and you don't want to be them.
[01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:30.863]  The other thing is, don't make rotten compromises.
[01:10:31.524 --> 01:10:40.732]  Never, never, never join a coalition where you say, I'll take part in genocidal cuts against working people as the price for getting into this.
[01:10:40.752 --> 01:10:44.976]  Because if you do that, you're discredited, and that's the idea of you.
[01:10:45.036 --> 01:10:47.158]  So those four or five things.
[01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:51.843]  Program, organization, leadership, and a strategy.
[01:10:51.903 --> 01:10:52.043]  Now,
[01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:53.902]  We don't have that.
[01:10:53.922 --> 01:11:04.729]  You know, people have, in the past year, people on the left and the right have wasted their time on various alternatives that turned out to be absolutely counterproductive.
[01:11:04.769 --> 01:11:12.575]  So, you gotta put away the anarchist ideology, you gotta put away the right wing, or whatever ideology that is, libertarianism, and get real.
[01:11:12.755 --> 01:11:16.097]  And real, again, is study something that actually worked.
[01:11:16.418 --> 01:11:17.799]  And Syriza, I think,
[01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:31.312]  Worked in the sense it mounted a serious combative Opposition to to the ruling class policies and it began to show a way out of it The program that they had we don't probably don't need to go through their program.
[01:11:31.612 --> 01:11:33.955]  Let's focus on the program you need for the United States
[01:11:35.743 --> 01:11:37.404]  We have an emergency now, right?
[01:11:37.444 --> 01:11:39.305]  This is a depression.
[01:11:39.846 --> 01:11:41.327]  As you're saying, it is getting worse.
[01:11:41.727 --> 01:11:50.532]  The events in terms of the finance collapse, I think they interest me less than the impact that those have on
[01:11:51.913 --> 01:12:01.203]  People's lives, right, on the rate of foreclosures, the standard of living collapsing, the hunger and lack of medical care, things like this.
[01:12:01.604 --> 01:12:02.865]  Morbidity and mortality.
[01:12:02.925 --> 01:12:06.308]  People are dying much, much faster than they should.
[01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:08.511]  So this is what we have to address first.
[01:12:08.571 --> 01:12:11.374]  Now, the first, basically for the U.S.
[01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:14.257]  you have about five complexes and the fifth we can just
[01:12:14.737 --> 01:12:17.400]  Talk about a little bit at the end, the international economics part.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.822]  But mainly, you've got to do four big things.
[01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.826]  Now, each of these things has various parts to it.
[01:12:23.846 --> 01:12:27.951]  But the first part is the anti-austerity, anti-cuts.
[01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:31.334]  And again, it means austerity is genocide.
[01:12:31.674 --> 01:12:33.136]  You have 50 million Americans.
[01:12:33.536 --> 01:12:37.660]  They have no job or they're a dependent of somebody who has no job.
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.142]  So 30 million, you get up to 50 million.
[01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:41.523]  They have no health care.
[01:12:41.643 --> 01:12:42.864]  That's another 50 million.
[01:12:43.284 --> 01:12:44.565]  They don't have welfare.
[01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:47.448]  Normally mothers and children would have had welfare.
[01:12:47.568 --> 01:12:49.049]  Clinton got rid of that.
[01:12:49.109 --> 01:12:52.112]  So it's bipartisan on the demolition side.
[01:12:53.933 --> 01:12:55.655]  And they're in dire poverty.
[01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:59.138]  So the one thing they live on is food stamps.
[01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:04.051]  48, 49 million Americans are on food stamps.
[01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:10.816]  Now, anybody who proposes cutting that, for any reason, is advocating genocide against the American people.
[01:13:10.856 --> 01:13:12.778]  And it's just, it's out of this world.
[01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:24.687]  And we, you know, we have the Republicans in the House now, they say they want to cut $32 billion, and now they've gone down to $6 billion, and the Democrats in the Senate say, oh, we only want to cut it by $5 to $6 billion.
[01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:26.388]  Those are all Nuremberg indictments.
[01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:36.038]  Anybody who proposes that stuff should be reminded that there was a Nuremberg court where people, uh, they paid a heavy price for doing things like that, because there's no difference.
[01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:40.944]  The ultimate logic of austerity is a concentration camp.
[01:13:41.508 --> 01:13:52.815]  Basically saying, you know, we're going to lower your living standard to the point where we're going to work you so hard, we're not only going to steal the gold from your teeth, we're going to take the calories that are in your body and use those.
[01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:57.838]  And when you're down, you know, to nothing, then we'll throw you on the junk heap and that's the end of you.
[01:13:57.918 --> 01:14:01.740]  So, the first basic point is no cuts in anything.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:07.263]  No cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, S-CHIP, Head Start,
[01:14:09.273 --> 01:14:09.773]  No cuts.
[01:14:11.074 --> 01:14:17.817]  This was the main point in the Syriza agitation and it would have to be the beginning point anywhere in the world.
[01:14:18.298 --> 01:14:19.118]  No more cuts.
[01:14:19.478 --> 01:14:21.039]  The bankers caused this crisis.
[01:14:21.299 --> 01:14:22.059]  They can pay.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.500]  Who should pay for the depression?
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.681]  Working people or rich parasites?
[01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:26.502]  Bankers.
[01:14:27.322 --> 01:14:38.290]  When you say bankers, and we'll get to in a second, you're not so much talking about taxing them as individuals, although there's nothing wrong with that, but it's mainly Wall Street turnover.
[01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:43.073]  In other words, if we're talking about two quadrillion of derivatives in Wall Street,
[01:14:43.493 --> 01:14:43.873]  I think so.
[01:15:01.307 --> 01:15:02.288]  The French Revolution of 1789.
[01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:04.709]  Wall Street pays no taxes.
[01:15:05.069 --> 01:15:11.313]  They pay nothing on the buying and selling that they do, and they pay nothing GE, right?
[01:15:11.353 --> 01:15:21.860]  Under Immelt, General Electric, which is a hedge fund, not an industrial corporation, has paid basically no tax that entire time.
[01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:25.802]  So, you want to maintain the social safety net.
[01:15:27.561 --> 01:15:31.405]  And again, that's simply a matter of maintaining your labor power.
[01:15:31.425 --> 01:15:35.750]  The reason you want to do it is obviously you can't have the descent into barbarism.
[01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.071]  You can't have people dying.
[01:15:37.932 --> 01:15:43.218]  But you've also got to, from the point of view of a nation, you've got to say, we need to have a qualified labor force.
[01:15:43.618 --> 01:15:48.984]  And if we don't maintain our, for example, university education,
[01:15:49.833 --> 01:15:52.074]  Soon we won't have a qualified labor force anymore.
[01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.795]  The Chinese will eat us alive.
[01:15:54.235 --> 01:16:00.358]  If you want to follow some of these recipes, you've got to factor in the cost of learning Chinese so you can take orders.
[01:16:00.378 --> 01:16:07.681]  If you don't want to take orders in Chinese, you better get ready to fund a whole series of programs.
[01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:10.462]  So the entire New Deal
[01:16:11.388 --> 01:16:15.833]  New Frontier, Great Society, Social Safety Net has got to be maintained.
[01:16:15.873 --> 01:16:22.561]  Now, the point about that is not that people should live on food stamps and unemployment benefits, because this is not the goal.
[01:16:23.182 --> 01:16:27.807]  It's an emergency stabilization so that people don't die.
[01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:31.389]  For example, Medicare for All, right?
[01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:45.598]  Just throw it all open, say, everybody who wants to can have Medicare, $100 per person per month, and if you're broke, if you're destitute, and if you're unemployed, then it basically goes down to zero.
[01:16:45.698 --> 01:16:47.779]  So, a series of measures like this.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.941]  The second point then is, look at
[01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.937]  Speculative capital, so-called.
[01:16:56.017 --> 01:16:58.439]  In other words, fictitious capital.
[01:16:58.819 --> 01:17:00.161]  Not all capital is real.
[01:17:00.521 --> 01:17:07.608]  And if you have a locomotive, if you have a drill press, if you have scientific equipment, that's a capital good.
[01:17:07.668 --> 01:17:08.209]  That's real.
[01:17:08.609 --> 01:17:12.673]  But a lot of what is called capital today, capital formation, is derivatives.
[01:17:12.913 --> 01:17:13.974]  And these have no value.
[01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:16.116]  As a matter of fact, they have negative value.
[01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:16.617]  You want to
[01:17:17.057 --> 01:17:19.419]  You have to pay somebody to take them to the shredder.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:25.505]  So Webster, what do you do to the counterfeit market that threatens to overthrow the real economy?
[01:17:26.886 --> 01:17:32.732]  Well, one thing we've already talked about is banning the most dangerous kinds of derivatives, right?
[01:17:32.752 --> 01:17:36.235]  We know that credit default swaps destroyed AIG.
[01:17:36.896 --> 01:17:38.958]  We know that collateralized debt obligations
[01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:40.529]  We're good to go.
[01:17:54.002 --> 01:18:01.028]  So, ban the worst derivatives and slap a one cent on the dollar tax on all others.
[01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:13.337]  For individuals, by the way, if you're worried about your, you know, trading for your retirement account, we could have an allowance of a million dollars per person free, right?
[01:18:13.378 --> 01:18:14.038]  Free of charge.
[01:18:14.078 --> 01:18:19.102]  So that if you have to, you know, buy and sell some stocks for your own purposes, that's fine.
[01:18:19.442 --> 01:18:20.263]  You won't be taxed.
[01:18:20.283 --> 01:18:21.324]  But once you get into the
[01:18:22.408 --> 01:18:27.371]  High-frequency trading, flash trading, program trading, a million transactions per second.
[01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:37.717]  Well, you got to see if they're doing a million transactions per second and one penny goes to the Federal Treasury for each one of those, that activity is going to die down considerably.
[01:18:37.777 --> 01:18:42.019]  It's going to be limited to things that have a real economic purpose.
[01:18:42.059 --> 01:18:49.223]  I would say a lot of the over-financialization, the casino economy can best be dealt with with a simple idea of
[01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:55.756]  We pay sales tax 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 percent in California now.
[01:18:56.197 --> 01:18:57.398]  That's a regressive tax.
[01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:58.859]  That's not the kind of tax you want.
[01:18:59.339 --> 01:19:01.601]  Let Wall Street bear their share of the burden.
[01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:03.422]  Those are not capital markets anymore.
[01:19:03.842 --> 01:19:05.524]  Those are gambling dens.
[01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:07.501]  That's one way to do it.
[01:19:07.962 --> 01:19:11.043]  The other obvious thing is end too big to fail.
[01:19:11.484 --> 01:19:16.766]  Zombie banks cannot have a claim on the resources of society, be it the U.S.
[01:19:16.826 --> 01:19:18.387]  Treasury or the Federal Reserve.
[01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.488]  They gotta have a social purpose.
[01:19:20.508 --> 01:19:21.169]  They don't have one.
[01:19:21.529 --> 01:19:22.789]  So let them go down.
[01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:28.212]  Put them through Chapter 11, more likely Chapter 7, forced liquidation.
[01:19:29.033 --> 01:19:30.213]  Get rid of the zombie banks.
[01:19:30.453 --> 01:19:31.634]  And when you do it,
[01:19:32.214 --> 01:19:35.197]  All the derivatives that they contain get destroyed.
[01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:37.258]  In other words, that's what a bankruptcy judge does.
[01:19:37.719 --> 01:19:44.884]  He distinguishes between obligations of the bankrupt firm that can be maintained and others that can't be.
[01:19:45.225 --> 01:19:49.468]  So the ones that have to be triaged are always the derivatives.
[01:19:49.928 --> 01:19:52.090]  Then you get into some of the things I was talking about before.
[01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.132]  You got to regulate commodities markets.
[01:19:54.772 --> 01:19:58.375]  Again, it's mostly a return to the New Deal
[01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:00.831]  Regulatory regime.
[01:20:00.911 --> 01:20:01.831]  Glass-Steagall, right?
[01:20:01.891 --> 01:20:09.453]  You don't want to have commercial banks and investment banks or brokerages and insurance companies together.
[01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:12.234]  So you got to re-separate those, right?
[01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:18.736]  It's too late to avoid the panic with that, but you can do that to avoid the next panic bubble.
[01:20:19.616 --> 01:20:20.856]  So I think you get the idea.
[01:20:21.497 --> 01:20:25.878]  If you do this, you're going to be reducing the specific gravity of
[01:20:26.832 --> 01:20:27.473]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:40.091 --> 01:20:46.774]  The banks that have issued these foreclosures cannot be allowed to loot the society because we want to save human society.
[01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:52.336]  They were bailed out by taxpayers and now they're going to do a favor to the American people.
[01:20:52.356 --> 01:21:00.719]  We're going to have a ban on foreclosures for five years or the duration of the world economic crisis, whichever lasts longer.
[01:21:00.779 --> 01:21:02.960]  So that's your second point.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:03.620]  You've got to cut
[01:21:04.187 --> 01:21:21.683]  The fictitious capital that's crushing the world, and it means ways to attack zombie banks, and ways to attack this tremendous cancer of derivatives, and also re-regulation that will prevent the hedge fund hyenas from doing their work, people like Romney.
[01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:25.356]  Is this question of the Federal Reserve.
[01:21:25.376 --> 01:21:28.897]  You cannot have the Federal Reserve under private control.
[01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:33.599]  A lot of it is privately owned, and a lot of it is privately controlled.
[01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:40.742]  And the only way you can avoid that under our system, is if the activities of the Federal Reserve are controlled by the Congress.
[01:21:40.882 --> 01:21:46.064]  By bills that originate in the House, get passed by the Senate, and assigned by the President.
[01:21:46.144 --> 01:21:52.587]  If you don't want to have a more far-reaching revolution, which I would not propose,
[01:21:53.456 --> 01:21:58.499]  Then you have to have the constitutional remedy to the Federal Reserve is that this is reserved to Congress.
[01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:12.247]  So, it means let the Congress, with public laws, specify how much credit, how many trillions of credit will be given out, what the interest rates will be for the various categories, and what the approved categories of lending are.
[01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:16.269]  So, what I'm saying is, nationalize the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:16.569 --> 01:22:17.970]  Federalize the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:19.371]  Seize the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:20.732]  Don't destroy it!
[01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:23.514]  Because if you destroy it, you've done a favor to Wall Street.
[01:22:23.534 --> 01:22:27.597]  Because from the Wall Street perspective, the Federal Reserve is a regulator.
[01:22:27.717 --> 01:22:29.619]  It interferes with them, right?
[01:22:29.719 --> 01:22:31.780]  In terms of their daily activities.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.402]  It's not like they're in love with the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:33.702 --> 01:22:39.486]  They'd like to go back to the time when there was no Federal Reserve and they could do absolutely anything that they wanted.
[01:22:39.546 --> 01:22:45.431]  So, make the Federal Reserve a national bank of the United States.
[01:22:45.651 --> 01:22:46.572]  Make it the fourth
[01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:48.770]  Bank of the United States.
[01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.471]  So that's Hamiltonian view?
[01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:52.051]  Hamiltonian all the way.
[01:22:52.431 --> 01:22:55.272]  And Hamiltonian because that was successful, right?
[01:22:55.772 --> 01:23:00.633]  Without the Bank of the United States, the United States would not have survived the first 20 years.
[01:23:01.073 --> 01:23:13.136]  As soon as the second Bank of the United States was gone, thanks to Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, you go into the crash of 1837, the worst depression that we'd ever had,
[01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:15.603]  A lot of states go bankrupt, right?
[01:23:15.923 --> 01:23:18.464]  About a third of the states in the Union went bankrupt.
[01:23:19.984 --> 01:23:25.146]  Economic development slowed down, railroad buildings slowed, canal buildings slowed compared to... Got it.
[01:23:25.246 --> 01:23:26.946]  Okay, so let's move to point four.
[01:23:27.447 --> 01:23:27.727]  Okay.
[01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.048]  So, but here's the thing now.
[01:23:30.368 --> 01:23:34.189]  We want to say to the central bank, national bank,
[01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:39.635]  Up to now, you've been doing 0% credit for zombie banks and hedge fund hyenas only.
[01:23:39.956 --> 01:23:41.297]  We're telling you to stop that.
[01:23:41.758 --> 01:23:45.161]  We're now going to do it for the American people and small business.
[01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:46.343]  Yeah, but not any.
[01:23:46.483 --> 01:23:47.984]  Not any kind of small business.
[01:23:48.305 --> 01:23:48.845]  Production.
[01:23:49.426 --> 01:23:50.567]  We know what production means, right?
[01:23:50.727 --> 01:23:51.148]  Industry.
[01:23:51.883 --> 01:24:04.530]  Tangible physical wealth, commodity production, assembly lines, building things, textiles, machinery, electronics, computers, firearms, mining, farming, energy production.
[01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:06.951]  There's a tangible physical result.
[01:24:07.071 --> 01:24:11.093]  Also scientific research, I would say, now has to go for production.
[01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:13.815]  So you're basically saying we're going to have a Main Street window
[01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:25.618]  And if you have a restaurant, dry cleaning, an auto repair shop, anything where there's a tangible physical product, not financial services, you can get a 0% loan.
[01:24:25.658 --> 01:24:29.759]  Now, the problem with that is, that would, in theory, be enough to have a recovery.
[01:24:29.819 --> 01:24:34.521]  But it won't be, because in the depressed economy, people are afraid.
[01:24:34.581 --> 01:24:36.901]  They're afraid that if they invest, they're going to lose their money.
[01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:38.382]  So you've got to take it one step further.
[01:24:38.702 --> 01:24:40.282]  And that's now going to be my fourth point.
[01:24:40.683 --> 01:24:42.223]  This is the defibrillator.
[01:24:43.095 --> 01:24:48.257]  You've got to have a massive program of public works infrastructure.
[01:24:49.297 --> 01:24:52.798]  This has been done under many, many circumstances around the world.
[01:24:53.078 --> 01:24:55.299]  We had it in the New Deal, kept the U.S.
[01:24:55.339 --> 01:24:56.600]  going through the 1930s.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:04.642]  You basically say, the states, we'll put it another way, we'll start from the new National Bank.
[01:25:05.903 --> 01:25:07.784]  The head of the U.S.
[01:25:07.844 --> 01:25:11.685]  National Bank, who is really the Secretary of the Treasury, says,
[01:25:12.395 --> 01:25:13.976]  We're putting out a tender offer.
[01:25:14.657 --> 01:25:20.121]  We want all the states to come forward with infrastructure projects, right?
[01:25:20.301 --> 01:25:21.042]  We know what we need.
[01:25:21.462 --> 01:25:27.107]  The Texas T-Bone, the California Maglev and the fast rail.
[01:25:27.527 --> 01:25:32.911]  We need the new tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey that Christie doesn't want to build.
[01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:37.695]  We need the new Howard Street tunnel in Baltimore so that double-decker
[01:25:38.475 --> 01:25:44.778]  Container trains can go from the deepwater port of Baltimore to the rest of the US, right?
[01:25:45.138 --> 01:25:49.520]  Similar things in Norfolk, similar port.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.562]  We've got a rail system which is collapsing, be it freight, passenger or commuter.
[01:25:56.266 --> 01:25:59.849]  We've got an electricity grid which is always on the verge of collapse.
[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:03.392]  We've got schools where I think almost half of U.S.
[01:26:03.432 --> 01:26:06.334]  schools are now 50 years old or more, and on and on.
[01:26:06.554 --> 01:26:10.117]  We lost a thousand hospitals over the past three to four decades.
[01:26:10.137 --> 01:26:11.258]  We've got to rebuild all of those.
[01:26:11.318 --> 01:26:17.543]  So, what you're essentially saying to the states is, states, you states, issue bonds.
[01:26:18.683 --> 01:26:20.925]  We're telling you to make them 0% interest rate.
[01:26:20.945 --> 01:26:22.046]  0% interest.
[01:26:22.066 --> 01:26:22.286]  For free.
[01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:26.329]  Hundred-year maturities.
[01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:28.450]  Century bonds.
[01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:30.170]  Caltech just issued some.
[01:26:30.191 --> 01:26:30.691]  They're smart.
[01:26:30.851 --> 01:26:32.011]  They issued century bonds.
[01:26:32.851 --> 01:26:35.732]  The National Bank is going to buy those bonds.
[01:26:36.172 --> 01:26:41.054]  They're all earmarked for useful physical infrastructure.
[01:26:41.694 --> 01:26:45.395]  And with those, we'll give you a trillion to start with, right?
[01:26:45.675 --> 01:26:46.955]  I call it a teratranche.
[01:26:47.355 --> 01:26:52.357]  A trillion-dollar tranche or segment of credit goes out to the states.
[01:26:53.303 --> 01:26:56.805]  And then, once that's gone, it's going to be a revolving fund.
[01:26:56.985 --> 01:26:58.046]  We'll do another trillion.
[01:26:58.066 --> 01:27:01.928]  Because remember, the essence of a national bank is it's a credit system.
[01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:04.250]  You manufacture money out of thin air.
[01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:05.410]  That's exactly what you do.
[01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:07.352]  It's the power of the state.
[01:27:07.532 --> 01:27:09.513]  The credit of the United States government.
[01:27:09.913 --> 01:27:13.216]  It is the most powerful institution in the world, in spite of everything.
[01:27:13.256 --> 01:27:16.318]  If it were well managed, it would be even more powerful.
[01:27:16.558 --> 01:27:24.464]  It certainly doesn't need to go groveling and begging to the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and these other parasitical bankrupt bankers.
[01:27:25.004 --> 01:27:32.888]  Imagine, you're going to go to Wall Street and beg those guys to lend you money, when the only reason they exist is thanks to federal government bailouts?
[01:27:32.988 --> 01:27:34.049]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:27:34.409 --> 01:27:36.030]  Eliminate them from the equation.
[01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:39.171]  Go to a credit system, and you make this available.
[01:27:39.311 --> 01:27:40.252]  All right, Webster.
[01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:42.273]  Webster, we're almost out of time.
[01:27:42.553 --> 01:27:42.853]  Hold on.
[01:27:42.873 --> 01:27:45.294]  I'm going to let you finish your points.
[01:27:45.334 --> 01:27:47.195]  Let me just add one little point here.
[01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:50.557]  We've got to hurry up and finish your other points now.
[01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:52.078]  Then I've got a few closing.
[01:27:52.578 --> 01:27:54.760]  Comments and questions here, but please continue.
[01:28:11.741 --> 01:28:11.861]  Yes.
[01:28:31.298 --> 01:28:33.980]  The water projects and canals.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.725]  You got to rebuild the entire electricity grid and you got to use the most modern form of electricity generation you can find.
[01:28:40.845 --> 01:28:44.327]  And I'm afraid solar cells and windmills just won't do it.
[01:28:44.547 --> 01:28:46.008]  So you take it from there.
[01:28:46.368 --> 01:28:48.710]  Then you got to do public buildings.
[01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.911]  You got schools.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:50.980]  I think so.
[01:29:06.885 --> 01:29:10.647]  Housing, and that could certainly be done much more.
[01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:16.849]  You've also got to make sure there's plenty of credit available, for example, for kids who want to go to college, right?
[01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:24.513]  Why do we have to pay 3.4% on a federal Stafford loan for somebody to go to college when a zombie banker gets it for 0%?
[01:29:24.813 --> 01:29:25.813]  Let's turn the tables.
[01:29:25.853 --> 01:29:31.096]  Let's have 0% for kids who want to go to college, and they can pay that back over 30 or 40 years at 0%.
[01:29:31.176 --> 01:29:32.076]  So, you get the idea.
[01:29:34.697 --> 01:29:40.141]  Your goal is to create 30 million new productive jobs at union wages.
[01:29:40.462 --> 01:29:41.042]  Well-paid.
[01:29:41.362 --> 01:29:44.425]  Not slave labor, not workfare, none of this garbage.
[01:29:44.885 --> 01:29:47.567]  High capital investment per job, right?
[01:29:48.107 --> 01:29:55.393]  If you give somebody a rake and tell them to go rake leaves, then your capital investment per job is like $10, right?
[01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:56.694]  That's a bad joke.
[01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.231]  The idea with the U.S.
[01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:01.215]  is this country has been successful as a high-wage economy.
[01:30:01.716 --> 01:30:04.820]  High capital intensity, high energy intensity.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.162]  Sure, let me throw a point in here.
[01:30:06.852 --> 01:30:09.253]  I mean, the system is at war against high wage.
[01:30:09.273 --> 01:30:10.173]  People don't understand.
[01:30:10.513 --> 01:30:16.475]  You just say you have high wages, suddenly there's more money, all real business and service does better.
[01:30:17.055 --> 01:30:21.476]  The oligarchs are waging war on that because they're waging war on the real economy.
[01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:24.337]  I mean, I get your point along these lines.
[01:30:24.717 --> 01:30:27.018]  We're going to finish your final point here in a moment, but Webster,
[01:30:28.516 --> 01:30:44.382]  How do you stop the oligarchs who want all the free credit for themselves, but don't want us to have the free credit, and if somehow talk about giving the public free credit is bad, but giving offshore eugenics-based banks free credit?
[01:30:44.402 --> 01:30:45.522]  I mean, you talk about power.
[01:30:45.542 --> 01:30:48.403]  If we just got them off our back, we'd be fine.
[01:30:48.763 --> 01:30:54.345]  Obama and his globalist controllers are shutting down one-third of our power plants right now.
[01:30:56.112 --> 01:31:03.794]  Yeah, see, power is going to go somewhere, and if you don't want them to have power, in other words, Wall Street controls the federal government, that's the essence of the problem.
[01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:08.455]  If you don't want that power to go to Wall Street, then you've got to take it yourself.
[01:31:08.495 --> 01:31:10.856]  And again, look at Syriza in Greece.
[01:31:11.556 --> 01:31:17.697]  If they could go from 4% of the votes to 27% of the votes, we could do something similar here.
[01:31:19.058 --> 01:31:22.638]  You look at the both major parties agree with austerity, right?
[01:31:22.918 --> 01:31:24.959]  Democrats say we want mild austerity,
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.221]  Republicans say we want genocidal austerity.
[01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:29.722]  Austerity, the same thing.
[01:31:31.383 --> 01:31:29.722]  80%.
[01:31:32.944 --> 01:31:38.007]  80%.
[01:31:33.084 --> 01:31:38.007]  Four-fifths of the American people say, we don't want any cuts in Medicare.
[01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:42.611]  You get similar things for Medicaid and for Social Security.
[01:31:43.391 --> 01:31:47.054]  Tremendous majorities, two-thirds, three-quarters, four-fifths, say no.
[01:31:47.434 --> 01:31:49.015]  Hands off our economic rights.
[01:31:50.412 --> 01:31:56.758]  If you decide to butt your head against this, it's pointless, and it's economically and politically counterproductive.
[01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:59.661]  You've got to have a mass movement that can take power.
[01:31:59.721 --> 01:32:04.105]  Now, you look around the world, you'll see governments everywhere are very, very vulnerable.
[01:32:04.465 --> 01:32:05.866]  They're all very unstable.
[01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:07.088]  Why not?
[01:32:07.508 --> 01:32:08.249]  Why not here?
[01:32:08.889 --> 01:32:17.514]  If Greece can do something along these lines, and actually become a contender for power, and maybe take power in the next election, what's preventing it here?
[01:32:17.534 --> 01:32:26.479]  Because people are crippled by right-wing libertarian ideology on the one hand, and this anarchist ad-busters Occupy Wall Street.
[01:32:26.519 --> 01:32:29.501]  The last point, the fifth point, is international economics.
[01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.737]  I know I can't go through this, just two points about this.
[01:32:33.218 --> 01:32:35.659]  One is, you're going to need a protective tariff.
[01:32:35.979 --> 01:32:39.601]  In other words, if you have all these guys who are exporting the jobs, right?
[01:32:39.661 --> 01:32:41.782]  Romney sends jobs overseas.
[01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:42.603]  How do you stop that?
[01:32:42.643 --> 01:32:45.744]  Well, one way, you're obviously going to tax it, right?
[01:32:46.065 --> 01:32:52.248]  Instead of giving a tax bonus for exporting a job, you want to have a tax penalty for exporting a job.
[01:32:52.268 --> 01:32:54.109]  But the other thing is, you put up a
[01:32:55.012 --> 01:32:59.955]  A modest protective tariff of 15 or 20 percent, it changes the entire picture.
[01:33:00.275 --> 01:33:04.537]  How can Americans be expected to compete with coolie labor, right?
[01:33:04.597 --> 01:33:08.219]  With low-wage, sweatshop labor in the third world?
[01:33:08.259 --> 01:33:08.959]  We don't want that.
[01:33:09.179 --> 01:33:10.200]  Why do we have to have that?
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.301]  Who voted for globalization?
[01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:12.981]  I never did.
[01:33:13.302 --> 01:33:14.382]  We don't want globalization.
[01:33:14.402 --> 01:33:14.983]  We're sick of it.
[01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:21.986]  Well, what's sick of it is the globalist brag that they designed it to implode all the economies, not to build up.
[01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:23.307]  That's the big lie.
[01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:33.676]  So let's forget the slogans of the libertarian right and the anarchist left, and get down to things that really attack the essence of finance capital.
[01:33:33.696 --> 01:33:36.518]  The other thing is, there is a role for gold in all of this, right?
[01:33:37.962 --> 01:33:39.283]  We're good to go.
[01:33:55.115 --> 01:33:57.617]  Look at American history in the late 19th century, right?
[01:33:57.637 --> 01:33:58.937]  The whole cross of gold.
[01:33:58.977 --> 01:34:00.258]  This was really, really bad.
[01:34:00.638 --> 01:34:06.582]  But the positive role of gold under the Bretton Woods system is you want to have gold settlement.
[01:34:06.642 --> 01:34:18.049]  In other words, at the end of a year or a couple of years or whatever it is, after all the buying and selling and all the, you know, the exchange going back and forth, two countries are either going to have a deficit or a surplus.
[01:34:18.509 --> 01:34:23.372]  And at that point, there is the possible demand to say, you should pay us in gold.
[01:34:24.453 --> 01:34:31.215]  Not for every transaction, but for the netting, the clearing of that entire thing.
[01:34:32.175 --> 01:34:35.696]  That's an important reality principle, because the way that the U.S.
[01:34:35.776 --> 01:34:43.898]  slipped into this financier control was when the gold convertibility was lifted by Nixon on August 15, 1971.
[01:34:44.718 --> 01:34:46.339]  This meant that the U.S.
[01:34:46.459 --> 01:34:47.659]  could just go wild.
[01:34:47.899 --> 01:34:48.659]  There you go!
[01:34:48.719 --> 01:34:51.020]  That's exactly what Lew Rockwell
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:51.580]  No.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:51.700]  No.
[01:35:07.774 --> 01:35:10.716]  We have three examples of a gold coin standard going back.
[01:35:11.137 --> 01:35:18.222]  The British went back to a gold coin standard in 1815, and that's the world of the Dickensian treadmill.
[01:35:18.782 --> 01:35:20.984]  Tremendous poverty, tremendous cruelty.
[01:35:21.404 --> 01:35:25.507]  The British did it again in the 1920s under Sir Winston Churchill.
[01:35:25.927 --> 01:35:27.769]  They went back on the gold standard.
[01:35:28.249 --> 01:35:34.176]  The biggest unemployment in world history was in Britain, of an advanced country, was in Britain in the 1920s.
[01:35:35.017 --> 01:35:35.998]  And the United States!
[01:35:36.399 --> 01:35:42.045]  After the Civil War, we had a very successful greenback system, which worked fine and should have been kept.
[01:35:42.549 --> 01:35:55.841]  But the gold... Webster, I get the fact that if you have free credit, or near free credit, issued by the state, it cuts out the banksters, it energizes economies, but it also brings its own fraudulent bubbles as well.
[01:35:56.201 --> 01:35:57.442]  None of this is a panacea.
[01:35:57.822 --> 01:36:04.708]  My issue is, the banksters, the oligarchs, the Anglo-American establishment, are genocidal eugenicists who
[01:36:05.589 --> 01:36:11.393]  They have this survival of the fittest, social Darwinian view that is not reality-based.
[01:36:11.413 --> 01:36:12.674]  So they are the prime enemy.
[01:36:13.114 --> 01:36:16.376]  I look at almost anything as better than what they've got.
[01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:20.939]  Yeah, but they're eugenicists, but they're austerity fiends.
[01:36:21.019 --> 01:36:23.901]  Right now it's the austerity psychosis that's making it.
[01:36:24.141 --> 01:36:25.682]  That brings in their eugenics, yeah.
[01:36:26.443 --> 01:36:31.988]  And then they say, you know, we'll create a world where you will die and we will triumph.
[01:36:32.008 --> 01:36:33.490]  Well, the answer to that is no.
[01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:35.772]  And here's a mass movement that says no.
[01:36:36.393 --> 01:36:41.618]  And I would urge people, you know, your audience, right, might be a good starting point for some of this, right?
[01:36:41.958 --> 01:36:43.740]  We've got to build a broad front.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:48.985]  I'm talking about national anti-austerity committees meeting starting in September.
[01:36:49.005 --> 01:36:49.966]  Because here's what it's going to be.
[01:36:50.606 --> 01:36:51.307]  In December,
[01:36:51.897 --> 01:36:53.580]  We're going to have the fiscal cliff.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.044]  This is a Republican slogan, reactionary slogan.
[01:36:56.284 --> 01:36:57.446]  Democrats have bought into it.
[01:36:57.466 --> 01:37:02.133]  So we're going to have the fiscal cliff, and there's going to be the pressure to have a grand bargain.
[01:37:02.194 --> 01:37:06.100]  And the grand bargain is going to be the two political parties, both of them.
[01:37:06.798 --> 01:37:13.702]  Getting ready, turning on the American people and saying, we're going to flay the American people alive with austerity cuts.
[01:37:13.722 --> 01:37:20.126]  We're going to take away economic rights that have been acquired by centuries of labor struggles and political struggles.
[01:37:20.146 --> 01:37:20.807]  But it's worse than that.
[01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:21.707]  It's worse than that.
[01:37:21.727 --> 01:37:27.071]  I mean, here's my next question, because now you've had your long 30 minutes breaking this down and I really find it thought provoking.
[01:37:28.211 --> 01:37:33.435]  How do we deal with a ruling class that raises taxes?
[01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:33.955]  Obama.
[01:37:34.657 --> 01:37:40.562]  Says you make $125,000 a year, a quarter million, husband and wife.
[01:37:40.903 --> 01:37:42.584]  You're rich, we're going to raise your tax.
[01:37:43.004 --> 01:37:46.868]  While Mitt Romney and the rest of them are tax-exempt, wrote the laws offshore.
[01:37:48.143 --> 01:37:50.263]  What you do is you agitate for your own tax.
[01:37:50.303 --> 01:38:03.926]  In other words, if you say, no cuts in Social Security, no cuts in Medicare, and unlimited unemployment for 99 weeks and beyond, the 99ers and everybody else, the next question they'll ask you is, oh, and how are you going to pay for that?
[01:38:04.206 --> 01:38:05.686]  By taxing Wall Street.
[01:38:05.986 --> 01:38:07.886]  By taxing Wall Street turnover.
[01:38:08.266 --> 01:38:14.968]  We want 1% coming out of every one of those flash trades at a million transactions per second.
[01:38:15.308 --> 01:38:16.388]  That's how we pay for it.
[01:38:16.428 --> 01:38:16.828]  In other words,
[01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:21.397]  It is also true that you could tax the 1%.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:31.826]  Much more than they're taxed already, and this would not be enough to really even begin to deal with the needs of the social safety net.
[01:38:31.866 --> 01:38:42.035]  No, I was about to say, yeah, but they break down those actuaries in the fake 1% that keeps their money here, who's not ultra-elite and exempt, like Google and General Electric offshore.
[01:38:42.055 --> 01:38:44.477]  I mean, the truth is, they've got how many?
[01:38:44.497 --> 01:38:50.482]  30-something trillion they admit offshore they won't bring in, and they've got hundreds of other trillions.
[01:38:51.215 --> 01:38:56.302]  Let's have, you know, in the New Deal, there was a really good thing, an undistributed profits tax.
[01:38:56.402 --> 01:39:01.208]  In other words, if you want to hoard money, and they say, you know, the companies in the U.S.
[01:39:01.248 --> 01:39:07.476]  have three trillion, oh, and they're so afraid, they don't have confidence, they don't have certainty, they're afraid to invest.
[01:39:07.756 --> 01:39:08.958]  Let's help them to invest.
[01:39:09.338 --> 01:39:16.824]  Let's say if you don't invest it, you're going to pay a 5-10% undistributed profits tax, and let's supplement that with an offshore tax.
[01:39:17.324 --> 01:39:22.628]  If you have an offshore account, we want 5-10% of that going to the Federal Treasury.
[01:39:22.888 --> 01:39:29.533]  And when I say the Federal Treasury, for most of these things, it's half for the Feds, half for the states.
[01:39:29.673 --> 01:39:35.237]  Because the states are the ones who've got to maintain the highways and the education systems.
[01:39:36.178 --> 01:39:41.643]  You know, through the municipalities, right, the obvious things, the fire department, the police department.
[01:39:41.663 --> 01:39:42.844]  Well, I'm sure here's the problem.
[01:39:42.884 --> 01:39:48.288]  Listen, I understand the engine of wealth, of productivity, of human ingenuity, of machines.
[01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.330]  We could all live like kings and queens.
[01:39:51.011 --> 01:39:52.572]  The oligarchs understand that.
[01:39:52.652 --> 01:39:55.675]  Their instinct is shut it down, keep us in squalor, keep us poor.
[01:39:56.395 --> 01:40:00.319]  My issue is, you get 60 million people on food stamps.
[01:40:01.164 --> 01:40:01.304]  No.
[01:40:01.324 --> 01:40:01.885]  Not anymore.
[01:40:20.325 --> 01:40:22.567]  You know, slowly, on the installment plan.
[01:40:22.587 --> 01:40:24.709]  I'm making them die the death of a thousand cuts.
[01:40:25.089 --> 01:40:26.070]  It's gradual.
[01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:27.811]  The resistance is minimal.
[01:40:28.151 --> 01:40:30.113]  He betrayed these guys in Wisconsin.
[01:40:30.153 --> 01:40:31.034]  Wouldn't fight for them.
[01:40:31.854 --> 01:40:33.215]  And the ruling class says, no!
[01:40:33.576 --> 01:40:34.496]  It's too slow!
[01:40:34.837 --> 01:40:37.299]  We want the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, right?
[01:40:37.319 --> 01:40:38.359]  We want a machine gun.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.082]  We want the atomic bomb on these entitlements.
[01:40:41.102 --> 01:40:42.183]  Because we're not paying.
[01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:44.064]  Because we're the goddamn ruling class.
[01:40:44.524 --> 01:40:46.886]  So, at that point, Obama out.
[01:40:47.347 --> 01:40:47.807]  They think.
[01:40:48.027 --> 01:40:48.588]  Romney in.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.503]  Romney is so inept that he may not be able to win even with the backing of the ruling class.
[01:40:54.563 --> 01:40:57.165]  This is now quite possible, and you can see it.
[01:40:58.125 --> 01:41:02.768]  But the ruling elite says, we're done with entitlements, right?
[01:41:02.828 --> 01:41:04.369]  You have no economic rights.
[01:41:04.429 --> 01:41:05.870]  We are going to flay you alive.
[01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:08.832]  Obama is just getting in the way.
[01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:10.553]  That's my final question here.
[01:41:11.394 --> 01:41:16.537]  Webster, you've got 1.4 billion bullets being bought, clear tyranny being rolled out.
[01:41:17.277 --> 01:41:18.458]  You're acting like they're inept.
[01:41:18.538 --> 01:41:30.788]  No, they got a plan to shut things down and take over, get everything of their corporate welfare, and they're gearing up to... I've got army documents that they admit are real for re-education camps, mass arrests.
[01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:33.170]  I mean, it's like Kim Jong-il took a...
[01:41:33.795 --> 01:41:33.855]  Yes.
[01:41:51.545 --> 01:42:01.088]  Look at the society, analyze the crisis, and say, what's the one point where an attack with limited forces would win, transform the entire thing?
[01:42:01.108 --> 01:42:01.929]  Let me stop you there.
[01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:18.694]  I want to hear your one point, but I get you on and respect you and are nice to you, but I've been able, by myself, I know Obama says I didn't build anything, to build up quite an organization with focus, picking the right people and hard work, alternative media, out of nowhere, to reach millions a day.
[01:42:19.835 --> 01:42:20.255]  Webster.
[01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:29.050]  The TSA groping our sons and daughters and wives and husbands has been a unifier.
[01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:37.339]  The globalists meant it to be something that broke our backs to train us to accept any form of degradation and humiliation.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.043]  It has been a unifying factor
[01:42:41.784 --> 01:42:43.125]  To bring people together.
[01:42:44.005 --> 01:42:46.427]  Other things have been a unifying factor.
[01:42:46.467 --> 01:42:47.728]  So where's the result?
[01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:52.851]  Where's the mass movement with a program and a self-conscious urge to take power?
[01:42:53.071 --> 01:42:56.333]  Look, you can see it, I'm sure you can see it with the leftists, right?
[01:42:56.833 --> 01:43:01.476]  Once you get into Zuccotti Park, the anarchists are there, they say, oh, we gotta fight the cops.
[01:43:01.816 --> 01:43:02.997]  Let's fight the cops.
[01:43:03.017 --> 01:43:04.798]  Well, that's the controllers manipulating them.
[01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:05.478]  It's pointless.
[01:43:05.699 --> 01:43:08.740]  But the other one, the right-wing version is just as pointless.
[01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:09.401]  In other words,
[01:43:10.021 --> 01:43:15.984]  If that's all you're doing, if you're invading, abolishing the TSA, you're spinning your wheels.
[01:43:16.044 --> 01:43:17.244]  It doesn't lead to anything.
[01:43:17.284 --> 01:43:18.305]  It's pointless.
[01:43:18.385 --> 01:43:19.425]  It's a blind alley.
[01:43:19.605 --> 01:43:27.908]  Webster, look, total education, total information, that's what's going to give people the tools to decide what they think is right.
[01:43:27.989 --> 01:43:29.089]  I cover the waterfront.
[01:43:29.449 --> 01:43:30.989]  I cover the waterfront, but here's the deal.
[01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:36.551]  I see Warren Buffett on ABC News every weekend promoting taxes, taxes, taxes.
[01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:41.212]  I see the oligarchs promoting taxes so they can get corporate welfare.
[01:43:41.672 --> 01:43:50.514]  So how do you reach out to libertarians and conservatives and explain that the globalists have made themselves exempt from their own laws to pick winners and losers?
[01:43:51.674 --> 01:43:58.756]  You have to talk to these right-wing libertarians in the same way you talk to a left-wing anarchist who's been duped by ad busters and Graeber.
[01:43:59.528 --> 01:44:01.990]  You've got to change your ways.
[01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:04.272]  In other words, you're on a path to defeat.
[01:44:04.572 --> 01:44:05.493]  It's not working.
[01:44:06.394 --> 01:44:08.335]  None of this stuff is going to be decisive.
[01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:18.684]  Decisive is, I mean, if you want to boil it down to one demand, it's probably something, at the present time, it's probably no cuts,
[01:44:19.702 --> 01:44:20.003]  All right.
[01:44:36.706 --> 01:44:40.670]  As the society collapses, there are a million things to protest, right?
[01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:42.612]  But you gotta see, what's the root cause?
[01:44:42.972 --> 01:44:44.634]  It's being caused by the depression.
[01:44:44.994 --> 01:44:47.156]  Depression leads to dictatorship.
[01:44:47.416 --> 01:44:49.558]  Dictatorship leads to world war.
[01:44:50.019 --> 01:45:00.909]  And the German experience was, there's no point in telling people Hitler is bad, wrote a guy, as long as the unemployment is so high, and the deflation is so bad,
[01:45:02.656 --> 01:45:03.616]  He's gaining, right?
[01:45:03.657 --> 01:45:05.358]  So you've got to learn the lesson, right?
[01:45:05.378 --> 01:45:05.938]  Learn something.
[01:45:06.219 --> 01:45:06.619]  I got it.
[01:45:06.679 --> 01:45:08.760]  Hitler had a program, other people didn't.
[01:45:08.841 --> 01:45:15.386]  So let me... No, until you could solve the problem of unemployment, the Nazis were going to gain.
[01:45:15.726 --> 01:45:17.267]  So it's the same thing we have today.
[01:45:17.587 --> 01:45:21.250]  As long as there's a depression like this, the institutions are crumbling.
[01:45:21.631 --> 01:45:29.737]  What the society is looking for is, they want to see a force, a political agency, a power that can say,
[01:45:30.533 --> 01:45:32.494]  I have the answers, and I want to take power.
[01:45:32.514 --> 01:45:37.337]  But Webster, the public is under scientific manipulation by television.
[01:45:37.757 --> 01:45:39.158]  The average person is in a dream state.
[01:45:39.178 --> 01:45:40.179]  But you're counteracting it.
[01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:41.780]  You're counteracting it, right?
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.482]  So you've got to say to people, look, enough of the TSA.
[01:45:45.542 --> 01:45:46.923]  I think you've covered the TSA.
[01:45:47.263 --> 01:45:49.365]  How about covering some labor struggles, right?
[01:45:49.605 --> 01:45:53.667]  How about those guys who were up in Wisconsin, right, fighting the fascist governor?
[01:45:53.907 --> 01:45:55.028]  There are fascist governors.
[01:45:55.668 --> 01:45:59.770]  The biggest tin-pot dictator we have is Governor Snyder of Michigan.
[01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:00.611]  He's a fascist!
[01:46:00.951 --> 01:46:08.715]  He wants to send dictators to control cities like Benton Harbor, Flint, and all these places, like the Detroit school system.
[01:46:09.015 --> 01:46:09.816]  And he does it!
[01:46:10.136 --> 01:46:17.140]  He's a Republican thug, and he imposes austerity, and also he uses it to loot it for his rich friends.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:18.460]  So there's a... No, I understand.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.682]  It's always austerity for everybody with the fat cats.
[01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:22.502]  And populism!
[01:46:22.562 --> 01:46:23.303]  Populism!
[01:46:23.843 --> 01:46:33.332]  Populism means you're fighting the ruling class because you want to do something for working people, not to them, not strip them of their rights, right?
[01:46:33.632 --> 01:46:38.116]  Not take away 63% of their food stamps when that's all they have to live on.
[01:46:38.436 --> 01:46:39.277]  That's insane!
[01:46:40.118 --> 01:46:46.323]  Sure, Webster, let me just stop you right there for just a moment and expand on this, you know, here at The Close.
[01:46:47.384 --> 01:46:50.067]  As a historian, as a researcher, as an economist,
[01:46:51.431 --> 01:46:53.853]  Because you've certainly accurately predicted what would come.
[01:46:55.655 --> 01:47:00.138]  If the establishment has their way, where would the world be in 10 years?
[01:47:00.599 --> 01:47:03.821]  What do they want to do versus other ideas?
[01:47:03.922 --> 01:47:08.445]  What do you expect to happen if this course isn't changed?
[01:47:08.525 --> 01:47:09.006]  In closing.
[01:47:09.366 --> 01:47:14.931]  I tell you, it's like Jimmy Stewart when he comes back to Pottersville
[01:47:15.672 --> 01:47:15.852]  Right?
[01:47:15.972 --> 01:47:20.496]  Rottenville, after he decided, you know, let's see what it would look like if I had never lived.
[01:47:21.017 --> 01:47:23.219]  The United States will look something like this.
[01:47:23.839 --> 01:47:33.989]  There'll be no unions, no unemployment benefits, no Social Security, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no S-CHIP, no Head Start.
[01:47:34.289 --> 01:47:35.950]  There'll be no child labor laws.
[01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:40.975]  College will be for the 1%, as it was, say, in the 1920s.
[01:47:42.592 --> 01:47:43.933]  Most people will rent.
[01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:47.734]  They will not own because they will have been stripped of their homes.
[01:47:49.835 --> 01:47:54.457]  Rich people will live in fortified, not even gated, but fortified communities.
[01:47:54.997 --> 01:47:56.898]  Most people will live in slums.
[01:47:57.758 --> 01:47:59.319]  Social order will break down.
[01:48:00.209 --> 01:48:11.942]  And the Chinese will be looking down on us from the moon, from Chinese permanent moon colonies and maybe even Mars colonies, where they'll be engaged in industrial production.
[01:48:12.463 --> 01:48:18.830]  And the United States will be essentially collapsing as a low-wage economy, because once again,
[01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:21.792]  We have an incompetent ruling class.
[01:48:22.112 --> 01:48:40.223]  The stupidity of David Rockefeller, the stupidity of Steve Forbes, just the cretinism of these people is so overwhelming that they can't understand that the existence of the United States in some recognizable form of civilization, this is not automatic!
[01:48:40.504 --> 01:48:41.744]  This is now in danger!
[01:48:42.205 --> 01:48:45.607]  And the thing that's bringing it down is the depression
[01:48:46.147 --> 01:48:50.612]  And then the response of the ruling class to the depression, which is to say, cut it more!
[01:48:50.712 --> 01:48:59.180]  Let's act out our austerity psychosis, and let's flay the people alive, then we'll have money we can pay for new rounds of bailouts.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.486]  Well yeah, that's the thing, is that they make money off corporate welfare and cronyism controlling the government.
[01:49:05.546 --> 01:49:09.630]  They know when they raise taxes on the general public, it cuts benefits.
[01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:20.679]  So it's just an instinct to dominate and ground us down, seeing us as a political threat, but in truth they're destroying the economy that empowered their system to begin with.
[01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:21.810]  Right.
[01:49:22.150 --> 01:49:30.095]  And remember, the one thing we know about oligarchy is oligarchs going back to the time of the Trojan War, right?
[01:49:30.315 --> 01:49:34.317]  The official explanation for the Trojan War that we find in the Fragments of Hesiod.
[01:49:34.337 --> 01:49:34.797]  Too many people.
[01:49:35.177 --> 01:49:35.798]  Too many people.
[01:49:35.858 --> 01:49:37.259]  Gotta have a big war to kill people.
[01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:45.103]  And then in the writings of the old oligarch in, you know, 400-500 BC there in Athens, the old oligarch says,
[01:49:45.723 --> 01:49:56.526]  He doesn't like the Navy, because the Navy is high-tech, and the Navy allows upward social mobility for the masses, and he doesn't like that, because oligarchs want a frozen social order.
[01:49:56.566 --> 01:49:57.226]  That's the other thing.
[01:49:57.746 --> 01:50:02.248]  In that future picture, the social mobility will be zero.
[01:50:02.468 --> 01:50:13.931]  In other words, if you're born in the bottom 20%, your chances of going to the top 40 or the top 20 will be zero, because you can forget it, because there'll be no college for you, there'll be no Pell Grants.
[01:50:13.951 --> 01:50:17.054]  Basically, they're a bunch of dark age, stagnant worshippers.
[01:50:17.814 --> 01:50:17.995]  Right.
[01:50:18.435 --> 01:50:19.796]  Alright, final question.
[01:50:19.936 --> 01:50:21.298]  And their ideology.
[01:50:21.358 --> 01:50:26.923]  I mean, it's the Austrian school, the Chicago school, monetarism, neoliberalism.
[01:50:27.343 --> 01:50:29.805]  I mean, they have an economic theory, and it's wrong.
[01:50:30.166 --> 01:50:30.946]  And it's genocide.
[01:50:30.966 --> 01:50:33.909]  Alright, Webster, we've gone for well over an hour and ten minutes.
[01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:38.954]  In closing, before we went on air tonight, during the first little break there from the news,
[01:50:41.667 --> 01:50:52.692]  You know, brought up the fact that you had been at this New World Fair and you mentioned Zeitgeist and I said, what is your view of Zeitgeist?
[01:50:52.732 --> 01:50:58.495]  Because I get calls all the time saying, Zeitgeist, Zeitgeist has been seen 50 million times or so.
[01:50:58.815 --> 01:51:01.236]  He put me in the first film, put you in the first film.
[01:51:02.574 --> 01:51:04.655]  They talk about a master planning computer.
[01:51:04.675 --> 01:51:05.915]  We live in these plastic cities.
[01:51:06.375 --> 01:51:11.617]  The head of it told me, he said, if I didn't agree with what they wanted, I would be put in re-education.
[01:51:13.077 --> 01:51:17.739]  So maybe I do need re-education, but what's your view on that?
[01:51:18.619 --> 01:51:20.039]  I've always been skeptical.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.540]  I was puzzled.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.321]  They put me into their first film.
[01:51:25.381 --> 01:51:29.282]  That must have been about, what, 2007, five years ago now.
[01:51:29.927 --> 01:51:38.893]  And the goal of that first film was, they said they wanted 9-11 truth, but then it turned out that they had a double goal.
[01:51:38.913 --> 01:51:42.775]  They said, we want 9-11 truth and atheism.
[01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:52.114]  And half of that first film is all about atheism, which I find to be a stupid, counterproductive, just wrong approach.
[01:51:52.154 --> 01:51:54.555]  It's also, you know, it's offensive, right?
[01:51:54.595 --> 01:51:56.776]  What the hell does this have to do with anything?
[01:51:57.316 --> 01:52:03.759]  That was typical of a lot of people who tried to mix in their own pet shtick into 9-11 truth.
[01:52:07.088 --> 01:52:11.790]  I haven't really followed them very much since then, because I've had a relatively dark view.
[01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:16.612]  But I believe they also promote peak oil, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:52:16.632 --> 01:52:18.553]  Oh yeah, they do, and Z-Day is going to save us.
[01:52:18.593 --> 01:52:23.176]  We're all going to throw our money in the water, and then we're all going to live in a plastic city.
[01:52:23.476 --> 01:52:26.798]  We're in a computer programmed by Goldman Sachs, but they don't mention that.
[01:52:27.198 --> 01:52:28.519]  Will tell us what we get.
[01:52:29.079 --> 01:52:30.920]  Sounds as close as to hell as we can get.
[01:52:31.461 --> 01:52:32.303]  Yeah, I think.
[01:52:32.825 --> 01:52:35.132]  As soon as they say peak oil, you can forget it, right?
[01:52:35.193 --> 01:52:37.660]  I mean, anybody who promotes peak oil is just...
[01:52:38.442 --> 01:52:42.104]  It's so dumb, and it's so obviously inspired by the ruling class, right?
[01:52:42.565 --> 01:52:54.231]  It's this group of, again, Darwinians... They're saying, get ready for austerity, get ready for Malthusianism, you're poor because that's the... it's sexy, like the Whole Foods magazine say.
[01:52:54.251 --> 01:53:06.939]  It's like they're... it's like a cheering, you know, groupies, cheerleaders for ruling class austerity to say, you shouldn't want to have a, you know, a car, or you shouldn't... It's like saying the Athenian Navy is too high-tech.
[01:53:08.044 --> 01:53:13.688]  Yeah, so I think the Malthusian inspiration for this is obviously a very bad thing.
[01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:17.671]  Anybody who professes peak oil is just a crackpot.
[01:53:17.831 --> 01:53:21.534]  You can forget them on just about every other issue, in many cases anyway.
[01:53:21.894 --> 01:53:24.036]  So I would stay away.
[01:53:24.316 --> 01:53:29.660]  The one thing I did notice at this New World Fair event, there were all kinds of people from Zeitgeist trying to
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.101]  Organized people, right?
[01:53:31.121 --> 01:53:33.943]  They were like missionaries all over this gathering.
[01:53:33.963 --> 01:53:35.424]  It was not a big gathering.
[01:53:35.664 --> 01:53:38.766]  People can take a look at my website tarpley.net.
[01:53:38.786 --> 01:53:42.169]  I gave a speech which talked about some of these organizing perspectives.
[01:53:42.209 --> 01:53:43.490]  In other words, how we got to get ready.
[01:53:43.930 --> 01:53:46.973]  But I thought Z-Day was going to... Here's the deal.
[01:53:47.093 --> 01:53:51.236]  I invited Peter Joseph, as stage name or whatever, on like a year ago.
[01:53:51.256 --> 01:53:52.917]  I said, look, we fought five, six years ago.
[01:53:54.013 --> 01:53:54.834]  I want to have you back on.
[01:53:54.874 --> 01:54:02.818]  He said, fine, but you must renounce that I ever said you were going to go to a re-education camp, or that I would be re-educated.
[01:54:02.838 --> 01:54:10.262]  And he sent me the video, and I went and looked at it, and he says on the video that, but I was like, no I didn't, you must renounce it.
[01:54:10.282 --> 01:54:16.105]  And I was like, well fine, you're all powerful, and everything, I will not renounce it.
[01:54:16.265 --> 01:54:17.286]  I'm a heretic.
[01:54:18.086 --> 01:54:19.487]  But he did say that.
[01:54:22.765 --> 01:54:34.413]  I just saw what the communists and people, it was always spaceships and technology and what they do, and you know, always these kind of promises of heaven, Valhalla, and I mean, it's a waning thing anyways.
[01:54:34.433 --> 01:54:42.358]  It's just that, you know, I see comments, and if you talk about it, the acolytes get very, very angry that you're not following.
[01:54:42.398 --> 01:54:48.622]  I mean, look, it sounds like hell to live in some big plastic dome city where a computer decides what you get and what you do.
[01:54:48.642 --> 01:54:51.003]  I mean, I'm kind of into free will.
[01:54:51.263 --> 01:54:51.964]  I know that's bad.
[01:54:52.918 --> 01:54:54.080]  No, absolutely, free will.
[01:54:54.901 --> 01:55:00.068]  Free will is the starting point for any reasonable explanation.
[01:55:01.289 --> 01:55:06.236]  I would just say maybe this movement is not important enough to be concerned about.
[01:55:06.276 --> 01:55:07.578]  The one thing we can say though is
[01:55:08.358 --> 01:55:21.768]  As the depression gets worse... You're going to have more and more groups trying to... You're going to have irrationalist movements of all sorts, and they will become a useful political commodity for the bankers, right, who can use them.
[01:55:21.908 --> 01:55:23.490]  And that's the danger.
[01:55:23.770 --> 01:55:29.994]  You don't want to have crazy, irrationalist, you know, crackpot mass movements.
[01:55:30.034 --> 01:55:30.595]  Now I hear you.
[01:55:30.635 --> 01:55:33.397]  Tarpley, I think that's like an hour and 20 minutes.
[01:55:33.617 --> 01:55:35.118]  Thank you so much for all the time.
[01:55:35.138 --> 01:55:35.619]  Thank you.
[01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:37.280]  I think people really got to hear your ideas.
[01:55:38.024 --> 01:55:38.525]  Glad to do it.
[01:55:38.545 --> 01:55:38.885]  Thank you.
[01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:39.986]  It was great having you.
[01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:42.828]  It's getting dark there in Maryland.
[01:55:42.868 --> 01:55:44.490]  It's going to get dark here soon, too.
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:45.590]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:55:45.871 --> 01:55:48.453]  We're in the twilight of empire, but we're still fighting.
[01:55:48.833 --> 01:55:49.514]  Oh, you know what?
[01:55:50.775 --> 01:55:52.236]  Let's just go even further here.
[01:55:52.676 --> 01:55:55.359]  I'm going to give you, if you'll do it, in the twilight.
[01:55:55.379 --> 01:55:56.800]  It's a little dark while you're on air.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:59.342]  Ten minutes, uninterrupted.
[01:55:59.702 --> 01:56:03.045]  Tell us about Paul Ryan.
[01:56:03.085 --> 01:56:05.087]  Tell us about Kolob.
[01:56:06.608 --> 01:56:07.228]  I mean, tell us.
[01:56:07.268 --> 01:56:08.990]  Tell us what you were telling me before we went live on air.
[01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:11.052]  Because, I mean, I'm being mean to Zeitgeist.
[01:56:11.112 --> 01:56:14.396]  I might as well be being mean to Children of Kolob right now.
[01:56:15.515 --> 01:56:16.236]  All right.
[01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:19.179]  You have, first of all, Mitt Romney, right?
[01:56:19.219 --> 01:56:21.021]  The Republican candidate.
[01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:24.064]  And anybody can see he's a hedge fund hyena.
[01:56:24.084 --> 01:56:25.866]  He's a corporate raider.
[01:56:26.366 --> 01:56:27.688]  He's an asset stripper.
[01:56:27.748 --> 01:56:32.353]  I think the actual technical term for Mitt Romney is asset stripper.
[01:56:32.393 --> 01:56:38.199]  In other words, you buy companies, you sell off the pieces, you wreck them, you load them with debt.
[01:56:39.254 --> 01:56:43.075]  Then they go bankrupt and you walk away with these huge sums of money.
[01:56:43.756 --> 01:56:47.077]  And this is facilitated by the US tax code.
[01:56:47.477 --> 01:56:59.100]  Because the money that Romney got in this Bain capital phase, which is from the early 80s, it's about 20 years, it's from about 1983-84 to 2002.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:04.242]  He got a sweetheart tax rate on that through something called carried interest.
[01:57:04.682 --> 01:57:07.863]  And carried interest says it's a capital gain
[01:57:09.266 --> 01:57:10.467]  It's carried interest.
[01:57:10.567 --> 01:57:13.309]  So, 15% in many cases, right?
[01:57:13.349 --> 01:57:18.373]  Whereas if he'd been, you know, paying tax on wages, right?
[01:57:18.853 --> 01:57:23.076]  Would be 35% for a lot of that time of different wage rates.
[01:57:23.116 --> 01:57:26.159]  So, that's Romney.
[01:57:26.219 --> 01:57:32.403]  Now, he does represent this Mormon political operation, right?
[01:57:32.783 --> 01:57:35.145]  There's a tremendous amount to be said about the Mormons.
[01:57:35.825 --> 01:57:37.667]  It's a church that was founded
[01:57:38.542 --> 01:57:39.543]  As a separate country.
[01:57:39.563 --> 01:57:41.065]  It's not American.
[01:57:41.425 --> 01:57:42.326]  It's not Christian.
[01:57:42.826 --> 01:57:43.988]  It's not Judaism.
[01:57:44.368 --> 01:57:45.389]  It's not Islam.
[01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:46.911]  It's none of those.
[01:57:47.591 --> 01:57:48.552]  And it's not American.
[01:57:48.632 --> 01:57:50.434]  It's not the United States of America.
[01:57:50.454 --> 01:57:56.020]  It was to create an entity, a separate country, eventually called Deseret, which would be
[01:57:56.824 --> 01:58:01.730]  A power set apart from and hostile to the United States.
[01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:15.968]  And if you read the Joseph Smith White Horse Prophecy, what he has in there in the early 1830s, he says the white horse of Mormonism is going to combine with the red horse, the British, the London banks,
[01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:19.600]  Against the pale horse, the United States.
[01:58:20.001 --> 01:58:27.853]  It's a pincers where between the British Empire and the Mormons out there in the Great Basin, the United States is going to be crushed.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.422]  Then this is inherent in it from the beginning.
[01:58:32.762 --> 01:58:33.883]  It's a theocracy.
[01:58:34.203 --> 01:58:38.346]  They say, self-government under a constitution is blasphemy.
[01:58:38.827 --> 01:58:40.288]  It's inherently impossible.
[01:58:40.368 --> 01:58:41.569]  God doesn't want it.
[01:58:42.129 --> 01:58:44.491]  We want to have a theocracy.
[01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:46.232]  It's very similar to Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:50.315]  Al-Qaeda's rap is, every government in the Arab world is illegitimate.
[01:58:50.928 --> 01:58:52.229]  Because it's not the Caliphate.
[01:58:52.610 --> 01:58:54.491]  Because it's not the Kingdom of God on Earth.
[01:58:54.852 --> 01:58:56.694]  Well, similarly with the Mormons.
[01:58:56.714 --> 01:59:09.666]  So, eventually they create this deseret entity, and in 1857, over the issue of polygamy, because Brigham Young had 70 wives or 80 wives, Joseph Smith
[01:59:10.166 --> 01:59:14.390]  Between 35 and 85 wives, thereabouts.
[01:59:15.291 --> 01:59:20.135]  Nobody else in all of Western civilization has polygamy, but they do.
[01:59:21.596 --> 01:59:28.222]  It's a very peculiar reading of the, not even of the Bible, but of their own particular texts.
[01:59:28.322 --> 01:59:30.164]  Well, it sounds like hell to me!
[01:59:30.464 --> 01:59:32.186]  Yeah!
[01:59:32.306 --> 01:59:34.127]  Many jokes have been made about this, right?
[01:59:34.167 --> 01:59:35.448]  Why would you want this?
[01:59:37.710 --> 01:59:38.931]  But there are reasons.
[01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:42.772]  There's a system of brutal crushing of women.
[01:59:42.792 --> 01:59:47.154]  You want to talk about war on women, look at Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.
[01:59:47.574 --> 01:59:52.596]  Now, Romney belongs to the ultra-elite of this church.
[01:59:52.736 --> 01:59:56.838]  Not through the Romney family so much, but through the Pratt family.
[01:59:57.378 --> 02:00:02.240]  Romney, as he tells you in his autobiographies, campaign autobiographies,
[02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:03.830]  Ghost written usually.
[02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:10.752]  Romney wants to tell you his great-great-grandfather was Parley P. Pratt.
[02:00:11.492 --> 02:00:12.492]  Parley Pratt.
[02:00:13.192 --> 02:00:24.334]  And this was, after Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, probably the most important and most popular among the Mormons leader.
[02:00:24.915 --> 02:00:27.055]  He became a polygamist.
[02:00:28.027 --> 02:00:31.128]  He went to Britain with Brigham Young.
[02:00:31.608 --> 02:00:41.391]  One of the things I think you have to grasp about the Mormons is, as that prophecy indicates, the Mormons understand themselves as an ally of the British Empire against the United States.
[02:00:41.451 --> 02:00:52.115]  In other words, you've got the British fleet off the East Coast and out in the Intermountain West, you've got this theocratic power which is opposed to the United States, Deseret
[02:00:52.915 --> 02:00:54.056]  Ultimately, Brigham Young.
[02:00:55.677 --> 02:00:59.760]  In 1857, he takes it all the way, and he basically says, I'm seceding.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:01.261]  I'm an independent country.
[02:01:01.661 --> 02:01:03.783]  And the idea was, this is timed.
[02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:16.352]  They've obviously got access to British intelligence at a very high level, and they figure that the bleeding Kansas, the John Brown's raid and similar things, are going to turn into a civil war
[02:01:17.012 --> 02:01:29.401]  In 1858 or 1859, so they decide to get the ball rolling, which they actually did, and President Buchanan had to send an army, one-third of the U.S.
[02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:32.844]  Army, to try to reestablish federal authority in Utah.
[02:01:33.064 --> 02:01:34.225]  This is a very interesting point.
[02:01:34.685 --> 02:01:36.767]  The first time a U.S.
[02:01:36.887 --> 02:01:39.789]  President ever said the word terrorism,
[02:01:40.507 --> 02:01:51.598]  Is the proclamation of President James Buchanan in 1857, where he says, the Mormons have created a strange system of terrorism out there in the Great Basin.
[02:01:51.939 --> 02:02:02.970]  They are in a state of insurrection, and I'm sending 3,000 troops, or whatever he had, a third of everything that he had, out there to re-establish federal authority.
[02:02:03.886 --> 02:02:07.587]  This is done in close cooperation with the British.
[02:02:07.747 --> 02:02:09.448]  All right, Webster.
[02:02:09.488 --> 02:02:11.568]  I'm going to have to have you back about this, because here's the deal.
[02:02:12.029 --> 02:02:16.370]  I have a lot of Mormon listeners who seem like good, hard-working, smart people who want freedom.
[02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:17.370]  They may be.
[02:02:17.410 --> 02:02:17.830]  Well, yeah.
[02:02:18.271 --> 02:02:19.911]  And I've got to be honest with you.
[02:02:20.191 --> 02:02:22.012]  I have not had time to research this.
[02:02:22.852 --> 02:02:24.933]  I'm going to look into what you're saying, because it's wild.
[02:02:24.993 --> 02:02:26.753]  British intelligence, the Mormons.
[02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:29.994]  I mean, I knew about the troops being sent out west and all this stuff.
[02:02:30.895 --> 02:02:31.815]  All I know is
[02:02:33.519 --> 02:02:37.224]  Romney was a deacon or a bishop or whatever it was, was a bishop?
[02:02:38.046 --> 02:02:38.366]  Bishop.
[02:02:38.767 --> 02:02:39.468]  Bishop Romney.
[02:02:39.688 --> 02:02:42.031]  So my whole issue is, would he be
[02:02:44.289 --> 02:02:46.330]  You know, loyal to the Republic or to his religion.
[02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:48.372]  But you go into that, who is Obama?
[02:02:48.952 --> 02:02:51.194]  I mean, these guys are puppets to begin with.
[02:02:51.754 --> 02:03:03.682]  And so my whole issue is, if Mitt Romney is a Mormon, that's more just from his family and a structure that helped launching all of his real actions as a minion to the global bankers.
[02:03:05.363 --> 02:03:08.165]  Yes, but, I mean, let's go back to Obama.
[02:03:08.765 --> 02:03:12.868]  With Obama, we pointed out that he was a creature of this
[02:03:14.145 --> 02:03:16.527]  Intelligence community foundation world.
[02:03:16.588 --> 02:03:19.911]  In other words, where the CIA meets the foundations.
[02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:21.653]  The world of counterinsurgency.
[02:03:21.693 --> 02:03:23.554]  The world of social control.
[02:03:24.055 --> 02:03:32.003]  And remember the famous speech with Obama where he says, there are these bitter clingers who cling to religion and guns and anti-trade.
[02:03:32.703 --> 02:03:38.787]  And they don't like globalization, and they cling to not liking people that are different from them, so they're racist, okay?
[02:03:39.147 --> 02:03:44.571]  So you could see that Obama had an animus against large parts of the American people, right?
[02:03:44.591 --> 02:03:45.992]  Because this is the rap, right?
[02:03:46.032 --> 02:03:50.035]  American people, reactionary, chauvinist, racist, no good.
[02:03:50.575 --> 02:03:54.317]  That's sort of a left-o-gawk point of view.
[02:03:54.377 --> 02:03:59.261]  But now, the Mormon rap is, the United States is
[02:04:00.370 --> 02:04:09.362]  Guilty of the greatest crime in the history of the world, the United States allowed the killing of Joseph Smith and Hiram Smith and Parley Pratt.
[02:04:10.115 --> 02:04:19.320]  In the case of Parley Pratt, the story is he went to, essentially he got mixed up with a family in Arkansas, right?
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:23.762]  Parley Pratt already had 11 wives, he decided he wanted to have 12 wives.
[02:04:24.122 --> 02:04:34.067]  So he takes the wife of the woman from Arkansas, the husband runs after him and kills him, kills Parley Pratt, the number two or three Mormon in the world.
[02:04:34.708 --> 02:04:38.830]  The Arkansas court refuses to convict Parley Pratt and
[02:04:39.916 --> 02:04:48.579]  At that point, when the Mormons secede in 1857 under Brigham Young, there's this group, it's called the Baker-Fancher Party.
[02:04:49.339 --> 02:04:54.701]  It's 150 or so people from Arkansas who are just trying to go to California.
[02:04:54.721 --> 02:05:03.064]  They're on the old Spanish Trail, they're leaving Utah, they're headed to California, and it's pretty clear Brigham Young gives the order and they're massacred.
[02:05:03.424 --> 02:05:05.464]  It's the biggest massacre in U.S.
[02:05:05.504 --> 02:05:06.645]  history other than 9-11
[02:05:08.025 --> 02:05:09.307]  Or Oklahoma City.
[02:05:09.507 --> 02:05:10.287]  Comes in third.
[02:05:10.628 --> 02:05:14.932]  And for many, many years, more than a century, it was number one.
[02:05:15.332 --> 02:05:18.595]  So there's a tremendous animus of hatred.
[02:05:19.296 --> 02:05:22.979]  I can mention one thing, the so-called oath of vengeance.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:33.909]  Under Brigham Young was put into the liturgy, what they call the Temple Endowment of the Mormon Church, a proposition saying, I promise
[02:05:34.867 --> 02:05:44.717]  And I'm paraphrasing now, to exact revenge on the United States of America and its people for what they did to Joseph Smith and Hiram Smith.
[02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:49.741]  And I will preach this to my children for four generations.
[02:05:50.937 --> 02:05:56.502]  This was only removed from the liturgy in the late 1920s, about 1927.
[02:05:57.763 --> 02:06:03.848]  Plenty of time for George Romney, the father of MIT, to have pledged the oath of vengeance against the United States.
[02:06:03.868 --> 02:06:10.554]  So I'm saying, you look at Obama, he's somebody who comes in with an animus against significant parts of the American people.
[02:06:11.135 --> 02:06:12.456]  It's not a good idea, huh?
[02:06:12.496 --> 02:06:17.200]  Well let me ask you this, are you saying, I mean they're all puppets though, you're saying go for Obama?
[02:06:18.343 --> 02:06:24.428]  I'm saying, I'm saying, I did everything I could to educate people about Obama, when they didn't know.
[02:06:25.169 --> 02:06:30.894]  Now, and you've done it too, people, people who want to know about Obama can find out, right?
[02:06:30.914 --> 02:06:35.117]  They can look at these films, I wrote two books, I got nothing to add on Obama.
[02:06:35.538 --> 02:06:43.745]  But, I'm telling you, people don't know the stuff that I'm finding about Romney and the Mormons, and I think this is equally scary, maybe worse.
[02:06:44.505 --> 02:06:46.926]  Because this is now a blood feud.
[02:06:47.006 --> 02:06:47.987]  This is a vendetta.
[02:06:49.427 --> 02:06:50.908]  What role does this play?
[02:06:50.968 --> 02:06:56.070]  But what about the Mormon prophecy that a Mormon will become president and save the republic when it hangs by a thread?
[02:06:56.651 --> 02:06:57.631]  That's called a coup.
[02:06:57.991 --> 02:06:59.432]  That's called a coup d'etat.
[02:06:59.852 --> 02:07:01.253]  That's the Joseph Smith...
[02:07:03.097 --> 02:07:05.059]  This is the white horse prophecy once again.
[02:07:05.119 --> 02:07:06.840]  It's the one that I was citing, right?
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.785]  Where the white horse of the Mormons and the red horse of the British gang up and take over the pale horse of the United States.
[02:07:13.865 --> 02:07:15.767]  If the United States is the bringer of death,
[02:07:16.683 --> 02:07:18.204]  I think that's too much.
[02:07:18.324 --> 02:07:19.244]  That's not accurate.
[02:07:19.444 --> 02:07:23.586]  That's not historically, you know, that's not the story.
[02:07:24.086 --> 02:07:25.927]  Part of it, but that's not the whole thing.
[02:07:27.188 --> 02:07:35.011]  The White House prophecy goes, at some time in the future, the Constitution will hang by a thread, and the Mormons, the saints, will take over the government.
[02:07:35.583 --> 02:07:36.604]  With a theocracy.
[02:07:37.004 --> 02:07:38.446]  And they will then rule the world.
[02:07:38.966 --> 02:07:46.033]  And Joseph Smith created a secret council of 50, which is not the Quorum of Twelve.
[02:07:46.073 --> 02:07:49.056]  In other words, it's not a Mormon church organization.
[02:07:49.477 --> 02:07:52.320]  It's a political organizing committee.
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:56.364]  It's like a strike committee, except it's a committee to take over the United States
[02:07:57.125 --> 02:07:58.586]  And then the world, as he said, right?
[02:07:58.606 --> 02:07:59.727]  He says, I'm going to have to keep it with us.
[02:07:59.747 --> 02:08:00.588]  Yeah, but I'll say this.
[02:08:00.668 --> 02:08:14.619]  They now teach Romans 13 in churches, so I think all the Catholics and Baptists and everybody, when Mitt Romney is sworn in as president, will kneel to Mitt Romney and pledge to do whatever he says because it's of the Lord.
[02:08:15.139 --> 02:08:15.780]  I don't think so.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.082]  I mean, the difference is, see, some churches are old,
[02:08:25.383 --> 02:08:30.850]  Most of the Christian churches would say, render unto Caesar what is Caesar and unto God what is God.
[02:08:31.251 --> 02:08:35.176]  The Mormons say, no, we want the kingdom of God, we want a theocracy.
[02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:38.415]  Webster, Webster, I was being sarcastic.
[02:08:38.495 --> 02:08:41.836]  Obviously the whole Bible is about standing up against corruption in government.
[02:08:42.096 --> 02:08:46.598]  I was just making a joke at people that tell me, do whatever government says because it's of the Lord.
[02:08:46.638 --> 02:08:48.638]  Those people might as well go to the devil.
[02:08:48.939 --> 02:08:51.639]  Webster, incredible hour, 20 plus minute interview.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.260]  Tarpley.net, thank you so much for the time.
[02:08:54.801 --> 02:08:55.141]  Bye-bye.
[02:08:55.501 --> 02:08:55.921]  Amazing.
[02:08:56.601 --> 02:09:03.023]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was a marathon interview here on InfoWars Nightly News with Webster Griffin.
[02:09:03.063 --> 02:09:04.564]  Tarpley, there he is, he's leaving now.
[02:09:05.365 --> 02:09:06.626]  Webster, thank you so much.
[02:09:08.027 --> 02:09:13.612]  This whole Mormon thing, I've tried to stay out of it, but Webster is a historian and has a lot for us.
[02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:16.494]  Maybe we'll have him on about that and have a debate with a Mormon or something.
[02:09:17.695 --> 02:09:22.459]  All I know is, I just want these foreign banks to not run my country.
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:25.723]  And I'm concerned about what's happening in our nation.
[02:09:26.243 --> 02:09:28.627]  And I think everything Webster talked about is very informative.
[02:09:28.667 --> 02:09:29.628]  We should look into it all.
[02:09:30.028 --> 02:09:32.472]  And you should also check out the films that are free online.
[02:09:32.832 --> 02:09:37.859]  The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, and get the hard copies at Infowarshop.com.
