[00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:05.052]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.732 --> 00:00:06.752]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:08.593]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:10.054]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:11.755]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.017]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:20.699]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:29.364]  You have found it, the tip of the spear, the front line.
[00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:44.325]  In the fight to defend human liberty worldwide, as open, hardcore, textbook, tyranny unfolds on a global scale, the United States is at the heart of that battle.
[00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:57.532]  Great evil, but also great good, resides in this nation, as it does in every other corner of the world, but the United States is the hotbed
[00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:01.443]  It is where the great struggle is centered.
[00:01:03.284 --> 00:01:05.144]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:19.370]  Constitutional scholar, pastor, patriot, former presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin is going to be joining us to talk about the NDAA, the increasing tyranny, the announcements that U.S.
[00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.172]  citizens will be tortured, killed, and disappeared here in the United States.
[00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:29.838]  The announcements that the United Nations now openly rules the United States through their puppet president.
[00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:33.560]  The Pentagon has lined up and sworn allegiance to the UN.
[00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.202]  An openly stated Congress has no authority.
[00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:44.247]  Absolute, in-your-face declaration of sedition and warfare against the Republic.
[00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:46.869]  And those words aren't even strong enough.
[00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.831]  Understand, that's not rhetoric.
[00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.373]  That is the U.S.
[00:01:50.453 --> 00:02:01.192]  Code, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, global precedent for thousands of years, right back to the Rubicon in B.C.
[00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:02.594]  49 with Julius Caesar.
[00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.016]  How does EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica describe it?
[00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:11.261]  That guy's printing me that, uh, crossing the Rubicon again, just that whole printout from Britannica.
[00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:23.470]  And Wikipedia just quotes Britannica in that section I was reading, where it said when he brought his military in and declared himself the ruler, he declared war on the Roman Republic.
[00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:28.875]  And there was a civil war, and he was successful and became Caesar, or king.
[00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.578]  Translates, really, to elephant.
[00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:36.218]  Caesar, Kaiser means elephant.
[00:02:36.638 --> 00:02:39.280]  And elephants were seen as the symbol of royalty thousands of years ago.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.781]  So it translates into that.
[00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:44.224]  And you saw what happened.
[00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:46.105]  Corruption began to pour in.
[00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:50.874]  And a lot of people say, OK, yeah, we are going into authoritarian system.
[00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:53.556]  Congress is becoming ceremonial, just as the Roman Senate did.
[00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:54.216]  What's the big deal?
[00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.058]  Well, they're going to take most people's property.
[00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:58.319]  They're going to conscript your children for warfare.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.401]  The police are fully militarized against this.
[00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:04.664]  Kurt was showing me video and news articles all over the country.
[00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:07.626]  Police are now wearing full U.S.
[00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:08.567]  Army uniforms.
[00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:10.128]  Just doesn't say U.S.
[00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:10.368]  Army.
[00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:12.089]  So it's all indistinguishable.
[00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.132]  All of our own tax money to build a giant military system against us.
[00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:32.201]  Drones, robots, surveillance, forced inoculations, banning of non-GMO crops, attacking Amish, attacking farmers, savage attacks on people selling cordwood on the side of the road, Agenda 21,
[00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:44.688]  Rural roads to be torn up and railways to be spiked, just absolute deindustrialization, dark ages, by design, scientific bedlam.
[00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:48.290]  It's here.
[00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.231]  And the tyrants are testing.
[00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:58.955]  They're criminally training everyone to come before Congress and say, yeah, you don't run jack diddly squat, there is no oversight.
[00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.337]  And not only is the president a Caesar,
[00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:04.243]  That would be one thing if he was an American Caesar.
[00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.124]  You might get good, you might get bad.
[00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:12.890]  It's treason, it's tyrannous, maximus, it's horrible, it's the maximum tyranny within the domestic confines.
[00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:15.692]  This is worse.
[00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:27.442]  This is a puppet tyrant, a puppet office of the National Traitor Council, the National Security Council, the National Sedition Council, and the Joint Chiefs of Treachery and Crime.
[00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:32.319]  All openly saying, we work for foreign powers.
[00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:33.839]  And who runs the IMF, World Bank?
[00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:34.899]  Who runs the UN?
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.620]  Who runs NATO?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.860]  The open private banks.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.581]  In fact, guys, during the break, print me an article.
[00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.121]  You'll see it in news or web.
[00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:45.702]  Just type in, banker coup over Europe.
[00:04:45.782 --> 00:04:47.102]  And it's like Newsweek and Timer.
[00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:47.823]  Like, it's great!
[00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.043]  The bankers took over without firing a shot!
[00:04:50.383 --> 00:04:52.464]  Gee, can we have foreign bankers run us?
[00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:53.324]  They actually say that.
[00:04:53.664 --> 00:04:55.664]  Gee, I wish I had me some foreign bankers running me.
[00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:57.605]  It's fun, yeah!
[00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:02.304]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:07.529]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.170]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:18.159]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.964]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:34.008]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.331]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.813]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:06.441]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:24.311]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:28.694]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:30.535]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:38.581]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:45.026]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:46.267]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:47.228]  It's incredible.

[00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:00.599]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:06.003]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:10.867]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:11.267 --> 00:07:11.668]  It's true.
[00:07:11.728 --> 00:07:14.310]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.292]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:21.517]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:28.985]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.067]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:30.287 --> 00:07:36.654]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:39.795]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.035]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:43.296]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:43.696]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:46.457]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:46.957 --> 00:07:48.677]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:03.001]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:06.445]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:21.261]  This is going to be an incredibly important
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.545]  Live Friday radio show.
[00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:27.630]  It is 11 a.m.
[00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.856]  and 8 minutes Central Standard Time.
[00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.751]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:34.772 --> 00:08:47.082]  Unfortunately, our deep analysis of the last 17 years of the global corporate fascist New World Order structure has been absolutely accurate, except in one facet.
[00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:52.186]  It's one thing to forecast and see their own battle plans, much of which are public.
[00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:56.270]  It is another thing entirely to actually see it unfolding.
[00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:00.947]  It has so many more nightmarish facets.
[00:09:01.627 --> 00:09:07.173]  It is so much more aggressive and fast-growing and openly
[00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:16.137]  Attacking everything that is good and wholesome because that can always be a center of resistance to evil.
[00:09:16.517 --> 00:09:20.699]  So it's going after everything wholesome, everything good, everything natural.
[00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:35.828]  Overturning the existing order of creation with genetic engineering, chemical, biological weapons, endless war, bondage, death, slavery, propaganda constantly that the tyrant global corporate government is loving and good and wants to help everybody.
[00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:47.725]  It literally dumbs down populations, manipulates good people into serving evil, attacks the family, the nation-state, the family farm, everything!
[00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:54.567]  It is unmitigated, pure, pit-of-hell evil.
[00:09:55.688 --> 00:10:02.350]  Because you see, in history, corrupt forces compete with each other for the power, for the ring of Sauron.
[00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.811]  And only the most cunning,
[00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:30.673]  Only the most given over to absolute pure ruthlessness, and beyond ruthlessness, an enjoyment of pain, suffering, humiliation, death, poverty, humiliation, trampling humanity, being trampled upon, pressing on the nerve of power, the priest of power, the priest of abomination, desolation, and the great hell that they're conjuring.
[00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:42.916]  Governments killed 262 mil, not counting military casualties, in the 20th century and they are preparing to engage in mega death upon mega death.
[00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:52.243]  Mega death to the power of infinity because they will kill and kill and kill and only allow small amounts of life to continue so it can be killed.
[00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:55.006]  I don't know if killing a million is a mega death.
[00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:57.421]  What is killing a billion?
[00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:58.702]  In fact, maybe search that.
[00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:02.106]  If a mega-death is over a million, what is a billion?
[00:11:02.126 --> 00:11:10.056]  Because the globalists all openly say, from Bill Gates to Ted Turner to the UN, they want world government to carry out an orderly extermination.
[00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:25.061]  But then Bill Gates is funding Kony 2012, this fake grassroots movement about invading Africa to save some children from some warlord who might have 500 soldiers under him.
[00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:33.926]  And if he has committed crimes, it's a micron of the president of Uganda and others who've been involved in the decades of genocide that's gone on.
[00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:37.349]  And now they've got George Clooney and everyone.
[00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:38.870]  Yes, invade!
[00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.430]  War!
[00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.791]  Afrikaans in place.
[00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:48.847]  In Uganda, in Kenya, in other areas, in now the area they've bombed out and leveled of Libya.
[00:11:48.887 --> 00:11:50.188]  The genocide's now starting there.
[00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:52.089]  And it'll be millions and millions killed.
[00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.731]  And then they'll say, oh, the UN didn't know this was happening.
[00:11:54.751 --> 00:11:57.213]  And all the trendies will still feel good about themselves.
[00:11:57.754 --> 00:11:59.095]  I've run into these trendy liberals.
[00:11:59.115 --> 00:11:59.735]  They're not liberals.
[00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:05.419]  These are scientific exterminists who know exactly what they're doing with their camp followers.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.421]  And they'll look at you and lick their lips and their eyes will gleam.
[00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:09.802]  They're like, you're not going to stop us.
[00:12:10.823 --> 00:12:11.844]  I've run into him many times.
[00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:13.925]  I've said, I know your foundation, Ron, this isn't about peace.
[00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:15.346]  They're like, you won't stop us!
[00:12:15.646 --> 00:12:17.427]  And then another little trendy comes over the act, old friendly.
[00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:19.408]  Oh, hi, I'm liberal, oh!
[00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:21.089]  And start talking to each other like that.
[00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:26.932]  But behind the scenes, they're just like... I mean, that's who Bill Gates and all of them are.
[00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:28.033]  George Clooney, all of it.
[00:12:28.273 --> 00:12:35.477]  It's just like... But it's all on the surface, like... I'm non-threatening.
[00:12:35.497 --> 00:12:37.118]  You understand that?
[00:12:37.518 --> 00:12:38.559]  And they mean business.
[00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:51.047]  Now, I can't read George Clooney's heart in these other people, but I know either they're complete useful idiot morons, or they are consciously part of this.
[00:12:51.087 --> 00:12:54.650]  And I've run into many of these globalists and their minions where they are conscious of it.
[00:12:56.312 --> 00:13:05.260]  I mean, you didn't think a hardcore tyrant and their coterie and squadrons and armies and gaggles
[00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.270]  of servant minions.
[00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:14.934]  Actually, you're going to run around wearing black uniforms and skull caps like the Nazis did, did you?
[00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:34.148]  No, they're going to walk around with limp wrist, acting foppishly, but that's all their cover because behind them is stealth bombers, tanks, special forces, biochemical weapons.
[00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:36.290]  Gigadeth.
[00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.691]  Gigadeth is what it's called.
[00:13:37.911 --> 00:13:38.772]  So a billion or more.
[00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:42.856]  So they want, they want gigadeth times six.
[00:13:43.777 --> 00:13:46.019]  They want six billion debt at least conservatively.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.920]  Six gigadeth.
[00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:56.648]  And of course they're telling their upper-level minions, oh there'll be a billion left, or maybe 250 million, we're not sure.
[00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.371]  They debate those numbers in different prospectus plans.
[00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:16.958]  But if you really read their deeper plans that we've covered here, it's like, no, we may allow a few thousand to live and then they'll be served by the robotic systems and get on their little space planes and, oh, I think I'll go to the ruins of Tokyo today, or they'll go to their off-world bases.
[00:14:17.178 --> 00:14:18.860]  I'm not saying any of this is actually going to happen.
[00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:21.883]  This is what the elite all talk about 24-7.
[00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:32.612]  While they have private transport jets landing behind them full of servants and chefs and people with all the organic certified food grown on their farms.
[00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:45.434]  On record, I've shown you all those articles because they wouldn't eat what they feed us for any amount of money because they're running chemical biological warfare ops on us.
[00:14:47.455 --> 00:14:47.955]  You understand?
[00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:55.066]  And that's why all of you that think you're going to win serving evil, all of you out there that get off on serving the evil, go ahead!
[00:14:55.848 --> 00:14:56.309]  Go ahead!
[00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:04.848]  Because you will be judged by your own masters.
[00:15:05.388 --> 00:15:07.749]  They are gonna tear you limb from limb.
[00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:16.111]  You're gonna wish you were torn limb from limb like some horror movie as you die under their chemical and biological warfare slow deaths.
[00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:18.052]  The globalists love slow death.
[00:15:18.332 --> 00:15:21.072]  They love killing you slow with their treatments once you go into them.
[00:15:22.453 --> 00:15:25.033]  And all the blind masses serving them.
[00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:26.634]  You want hell?
[00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:27.814]  You got it.
[00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:31.986]  So go ahead, don't choose good.
[00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.987]  Call me a lying kook.
[00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.509]  Call the truth a lie right in its face.
[00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:44.936]  But don't say you weren't warned because there's a universal spiritual metaphysical rule that you must be given the choice.
[00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:47.218]  You must be told the truth.
[00:15:47.538 --> 00:15:49.700]  You must be told the way out.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.085]  So you can then deny it before God turns you over to what you love.
[00:16:02.273 --> 00:16:12.698]  I have a lot of anger because I love the beauty of this planet, I love my family, I love my life, and I am angry that I'm right and that all of this is just going to continue to rot.
[00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:22.583]  And that we're going to look back on today, as I said a year ago, you're going to look back on the present time and everything before it as the good old times.
[00:16:22.964 --> 00:16:26.245]  Even if you thought times were bad, you have seen nothing.
[00:16:26.325 --> 00:16:27.046]  If they're able,
[00:16:28.257 --> 00:16:32.958]  To abolish the Bill of Rights and Constitution incrementally, they would then start doing it in big ways.
[00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:41.960]  And now the FBI director went before Congress and said, I don't know if the President can kill Americans without trial or arrest here, because the President claims that power.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.900]  He just wouldn't say it.
[00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:46.221]  And they're like, but you're not allowed to do that.
[00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:49.842]  The President wanted these powers, but says he won't use them.
[00:16:50.262 --> 00:16:54.703]  Congress treasonously gave the President the dictatorial power he demanded.
[00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:19.737]  And now Congress is angry that he sent his emissaries, his henchmen in there, the generals, the joint chiefs, the chairman, and the traitorous, treacherous foreign banker asset Panetta, to tell them repeatedly, over and over again, no, Senators, we do not get authority from war from you.
[00:17:22.193 --> 00:17:24.375]  And the Senators are like, are you saying the President can act alone?
[00:17:24.395 --> 00:17:25.896]  That's not in the Constitution, that's illegal.
[00:17:25.956 --> 00:17:26.416]  And they go, no!
[00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:28.818]  He acts under the UN and NATO.
[00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:34.883]  And the Senators start saying, I'm losing my breath, I'm having... You can tell they're actually having adrenaline rushes.
[00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:37.185]  They're like, you're saying... And they're like, you're nothing!
[00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:37.845]  You're nothing!
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.481]  Read PDD 51, just the synopsis that was declassified.
[00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.581]  They won't release the full text.
[00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:49.122]  But the synopsis, three pages, says Congress can be completely suspended.
[00:17:49.342 --> 00:17:57.405]  The president for any emergency, including an undeclared one, or a secret emergency, or economic emergency, suspends everything and is absolute ruler.
[00:17:58.825 --> 00:18:04.067]  And that president and that office serves the United Nations and the globalists.
[00:18:04.287 --> 00:18:05.567]  Let me show you something here.
[00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:07.448]  We can put this on screen.
[00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.042]  This is Time Magazine, last November.
[00:18:11.662 --> 00:18:12.743]  What does it say right here?
[00:18:13.243 --> 00:18:14.783]  Regime change in Europe.
[00:18:15.604 --> 00:18:18.185]  Do Greece and Italy amount to a banker's coup?
[00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:26.027]  And then it goes on to say, well yeah, the bankers are now appointing the Prime Ministers and Presidents, and the countries have signed on to the bankers' debt.
[00:18:26.047 --> 00:18:27.328]  They don't tell you that part.
[00:18:27.888 --> 00:18:32.570]  And then now the Economist, the Financial Times, every day, without looking.
[00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:45.911]  I see mainstream articles saying, yes, finance oligarchs will rule the world, and yes, it's a private corporate world government, and yes, liberty is being abolished, but that's a good thing.
[00:18:46.031 --> 00:18:47.912]  I remember the Financial Times of London three years ago.
[00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:48.913]  It's an Obama deception.
[00:18:50.173 --> 00:18:57.617]  Their foreign editor said, and now for world government, and he said, yeah, it's authoritarian, we kept it secret, and we're going to launch it now.
[00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:00.698]  But it's good that we're going to take all your freedoms.
[00:19:02.193 --> 00:19:05.475]  That's what the FBI director, that's what the Attorney General said last week in Congress.
[00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:08.396]  He said, well yeah, we can kill citizens overseas or domestically.
[00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:11.978]  And they said, but there's no due process.
[00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.179]  There's no, you just kill people?
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.421]  And he goes, well yeah, we make a determination.
[00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:19.181]  Because we decide.
[00:19:20.162 --> 00:19:21.022]  We the executive.
[00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:23.744]  And see, now the executive has been told
[00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:33.083]  You can kill anybody, bomb anybody, launch wars anywhere by Congress, and so they come into Congress and say, okay, you're vestigial, you're ceremonial.
[00:19:35.563 --> 00:19:36.144]  You understand?
[00:19:36.224 --> 00:19:37.184]  And they wouldn't be doing it.
[00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:46.486]  Implode this country and this culture.
[00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:51.953]  So there's the headline in red at Infowars.com.
[00:19:51.973 --> 00:19:52.834]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:19:53.155 --> 00:19:53.915]  Coup d'etat!
[00:19:54.656 --> 00:19:56.918]  Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial.
[00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:57.619]  U.S.
[00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:59.261]  now under full banker occupation.
[00:20:00.478 --> 00:20:05.099]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:21:38.302 --> 00:21:39.043]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.103 --> 00:21:45.247]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:46.188]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:23:53.675 --> 00:23:55.036]  123survivalplan.com.
[00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:55.556]  Again,
[00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:58.319]  That's 123survivalplan.com.
[00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:07.190]  We are back live, and I am very upset.
[00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:14.399]  I am very sad that we have been accurate and that we have been right about our prognosis for this republic and the world.
[00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:34.114]  Hundreds of establishment publications are now promoting the idea that secret arrest is good, that foreign private banks running our countries and even our towns and cities as they go bankrupt, it's openly being announced, is good, that we will be conscripted into corporate work brigades on top of our taxes once things fully collapse.
[00:24:34.614 --> 00:24:38.537]  Now that's being prepared through the Governor's Council and is in executive orders.
[00:24:39.118 --> 00:24:43.701]  Just type in Executive Orders for Forced Labor and they'll all pop up for you at whitehouse.gov.
[00:24:43.741 --> 00:24:47.184]  There's a whole bunch of different concurrent resolutions on that.
[00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:57.172]  And the police are going to show up, just like in Russia or China, and say, come help build roads, ditches, on top of your other jobs, on top of everything.
[00:24:58.153 --> 00:25:01.556]  And of course, if you're homeless, they'll just send you to a FEMA camp, but you'll have to work there.
[00:25:02.486 --> 00:25:16.332]  And the government admitted in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that you will work at the civilian inmate labor camp, even if you are not convicted of a crime, because you've got to pay for your keep.
[00:25:17.353 --> 00:25:18.453]  And that's the new America.
[00:25:18.493 --> 00:25:27.137]  And all the control freaks, all the nobodies, all the people that couldn't get a job, all the folks that want to be bullies, they're going to work for Homeland Security.
[00:25:28.456 --> 00:25:33.481]  And rape our wives, and beat us up, and kill us, and forcibly inoculate us.
[00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:37.385]  This is what happens in every country, and they're planning it here, and they're training them for it.
[00:25:37.925 --> 00:25:39.767]  Hell is being prepared for this country.
[00:25:40.187 --> 00:25:42.550]  And just incrementally, they're just going to get everybody ready for it.
[00:25:45.805 --> 00:25:47.306]  Or we could wake up and say no to this.
[00:25:47.526 --> 00:26:09.082]  And the good news is, I've told everybody that when they come to this point of open martial law, open tyranny, open secret arrest, open disappearances of people with bags over their heads, that if the Congress and if the states say no, and call the occupied federal government, it's run by foreign banks, publicly, call their bluff.
[00:26:09.882 --> 00:26:14.586]  I mean, let the TSA and the Feds put F-16s in the air and say no air traffic to Texas.
[00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:17.062]  Go ahead and let that unfold!
[00:26:20.103 --> 00:26:27.385]  You heard military officers calling yesterday, and this is in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act 07, so I don't need to hear it from them, but it was good to hear the inside.
[00:26:27.645 --> 00:26:28.945]  I didn't just believe the callers.
[00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:29.945]  I already knew it.
[00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:48.969]  But he said, yeah, when Perry made the comment about Texas secession, which was just for political rhetoric gain with constituents that are awake to the 10th Amendment, they put the National Guard in all the states around Texas on alert, prepared them, and got their armored vehicles and tanks ready to invade the state of Texas.
[00:26:53.797 --> 00:26:54.617]  That's what's going on here.
[00:26:55.598 --> 00:27:10.143]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act says insurrection, civil unrest insurrection in the states and by legislatures and governors, and then it says real dryly in there, if there's a problem, I read it on air many times, you can go look it up, with governors.
[00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:13.579]  Replacing governors.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.040]  You know, that happened twice here in Texas during Reconstruction.
[00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:23.562]  Texas ran two appointed northern governors out of the Capitol.
[00:27:24.942 --> 00:27:25.682]  In gun battles.
[00:27:26.503 --> 00:27:27.323]  At the Texas Capitol.
[00:27:28.963 --> 00:27:31.424]  So see, the globalists have done this in a lot of other countries.
[00:27:31.444 --> 00:27:32.324]  They've done this here.
[00:27:33.144 --> 00:27:33.804]  And they know.
[00:27:34.405 --> 00:27:34.865]  They know.
[00:27:34.985 --> 00:27:38.245]  So, the Pentagon-Northcom is aimed at the states.
[00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:39.126]  Publicly.
[00:27:39.746 --> 00:27:40.226]  It's all there.
[00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:52.734]  So, it's time for people to understand that in the old days, the central government would just roll in and say, we're the central government.
[00:27:56.396 --> 00:28:01.018]  In the modern times, the central government's run by foreign assets, foreign corporations.
[00:28:01.358 --> 00:28:09.542]  It will stage terror attacks to make the federal government, FedGov, which is just the receivership arm of the bankers, look like the victim.
[00:28:11.102 --> 00:28:13.323]  Just like Oklahoma City, just like 9-11, all of it.
[00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:20.486]  9-11 was a pretext to fully enslave this country and turn it into an engine of global domination.
[00:28:21.306 --> 00:28:24.767]  And the globalists want to overthrow every existing forum.
[00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:26.508]  They state they want a post-industrial world.
[00:28:26.768 --> 00:28:30.329]  They want all the shops out of business, the movie theaters, golf courses.
[00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:35.671]  When they're done, you're going to have the economy of this country shut down by more than 70%.
[00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:39.172]  That's Maury Strong and the UN's public plan.
[00:28:39.472 --> 00:28:41.533]  The elite are all going to move to other countries.
[00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:48.698]  America is meant to be absolutely crushed and destroyed and sucked dry.
[00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:53.105]  And when they're done, they're going to fire 90 plus percent of the police, the goon forces, all of them.
[00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:56.210]  You're going to be living in slums as well.
[00:28:57.466 --> 00:28:57.946]  Well, they're done.
[00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:58.807]  And you're going to love it, though.
[00:28:58.827 --> 00:28:59.287]  It doesn't matter.
[00:28:59.327 --> 00:29:03.410]  The fun you're going to have killing this country is going to be worth it.
[00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.470]  I know your heart.
[00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:05.671]  I do understand it.
[00:29:06.652 --> 00:29:10.594]  And I know there are a lot of police and military who are not totally given over to evil.
[00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:14.537]  But I'm telling you right now, going along with this is the same.
[00:29:14.837 --> 00:29:16.198]  You might as well not be lukewarm.
[00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:25.884]  You might as well, if you're not going to speak out and do things to stop this, then you might as well go put a black uniform on, get on your knees, ask Satan into your life, and totally serve evil.
[00:29:26.104 --> 00:29:27.545]  Because you might as well just go the whole way.
[00:29:28.386 --> 00:29:29.147]  You understand that?
[00:29:30.868 --> 00:29:33.911]  You were hot nor cold, you were lukewarm, I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:35.952]  You lukewarm people are the worst.
[00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:37.193]  Evil?
[00:29:37.654 --> 00:29:39.295]  I don't like it, but I understand it.
[00:29:40.376 --> 00:29:40.956]  It's the enemy.
[00:29:41.357 --> 00:29:44.359]  But those of you that roll over to this, you make me want to throw up.
[00:29:44.379 --> 00:29:45.400]  Key News straight ahead.
[00:29:48.903 --> 00:29:49.804]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.304 --> 00:29:51.805]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.831 --> 00:29:55.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:15.115]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:19.776]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:20.802 --> 00:30:32.814]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:33.574 --> 00:30:40.841]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:51.109]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[00:31:00.137 --> 00:31:04.841]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:31:59.873 --> 00:32:00.893]  I had tried everything.
[00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:06.015]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:10.916]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:32:11.256 --> 00:32:17.638]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:32:18.118 --> 00:32:28.602]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:33.464]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:32:33.824 --> 00:32:36.805]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:32:37.165 --> 00:32:39.826]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:32:40.066 --> 00:32:41.207]  Now that's results.
[00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:48.050]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:53.753]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:32:54.153 --> 00:32:56.374]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:32:56.714 --> 00:32:57.955]  Infowarsteam.com
[00:33:26.482 --> 00:33:27.623]  Monday through Friday.
[00:33:27.643 --> 00:33:28.724]  We don't know how long.
[00:33:28.744 --> 00:33:30.045]  We're here.
[00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:32.667]  12 noon to 3 pm Eastern.
[00:33:32.687 --> 00:33:35.109]  9 to noon Pacific.
[00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:37.431]  10 to 1 Mountain.
[00:33:40.073 --> 00:33:46.198]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.tv where we stream video of the radio show and have the nightly news and more.
[00:33:47.446 --> 00:33:53.188]  And InfoWars.com and Auxiliary Cruisers, InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:53.608 --> 00:34:05.131]  The Feds have announced in Wired Magazine and other places they will take any .com or other variant website controlled by them through a certain registrar system.
[00:34:05.171 --> 00:34:07.532]  In fact, guys, you re-pull me that Wired Magazine article.
[00:34:07.552 --> 00:34:08.492]  I meant to get to it yesterday.
[00:34:08.532 --> 00:34:08.852]  Thank you.
[00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.691]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:14.792]  They'll just take any website they want, including if it's critical of the government.
[00:34:15.272 --> 00:34:18.673]  YouTube admits their order to take down videos that are, quote, critical of the government.
[00:34:20.794 --> 00:34:32.778]  Homeland Security is on record threatening a mainstream TV news show in Florida, saying do not interview the engineer who's criticizing the TSA.
[00:34:32.838 --> 00:34:33.819]  This is your warning.
[00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:37.260]  Just absolute total criminal government.
[00:34:38.442 --> 00:34:42.024]  TSA wouldn't call up TV stations and say, don't cover this if you know what's good for you.
[00:34:42.464 --> 00:34:44.205]  We strongly advise you not to.
[00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:48.107]  They wouldn't have the state police trying to get me off 590 AM here in town.
[00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:54.230]  You know, calling everybody up there, making bizarre statements, if they hadn't been given the green light.
[00:34:54.511 --> 00:34:58.233]  It's time to show the American people the scum they are.
[00:34:58.593 --> 00:35:00.454]  It's time to grope their women and children.
[00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:02.615]  It's time to harass old women dying of cancer.
[00:35:02.915 --> 00:35:04.716]  It's time to set up military checkpoints.
[00:35:04.976 --> 00:35:05.897]  It's time to
[00:35:06.497 --> 00:35:08.199]  Give tens of trillions to foreign banks.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.924]  It's time to put up face scanning cameras and license plate readers everywhere.
[00:35:12.365 --> 00:35:18.032]  It's time to launch wars without congressional approval illegally and tell Congress to go fly a kite!
[00:35:19.062 --> 00:35:26.104]  It's time to ship guns into Mexico and blame the Second Amendment and have the government caught shipping cocaine into every major state in federal court and not getting in trouble.
[00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:30.766]  It's time to have DynCorp and Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings and not getting in trouble.
[00:35:30.986 --> 00:35:32.427]  It's time to kill a million Iraqis.
[00:35:32.627 --> 00:35:34.447]  It's time to tell the public torture is good.
[00:35:34.647 --> 00:35:39.249]  It's time to have every tough guy on cop shows torturing people and violating the Constitution.
[00:35:39.529 --> 00:35:43.890]  It's time to not just abort babies in the womb, but up to age three.
[00:35:44.271 --> 00:35:45.571]  And I see it all over the news now.
[00:35:45.591 --> 00:35:48.192]  They're criticizing people that aren't for killing babies up to age three.
[00:35:49.502 --> 00:35:50.942]  And if you're a new listener, you're like, what are you talking about?
[00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.523]  Oh, you haven't read AP, Reuters, all of it?
[00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:54.803]  Like, what's wrong with killing babies up to age three?
[00:35:55.004 --> 00:35:56.084]  They're not really conscious.
[00:35:56.444 --> 00:35:58.444]  The bioethicists say that means eugenics.
[00:35:59.965 --> 00:36:03.566]  You see, and you're like, no, it's crazy to kill babies up to age three.
[00:36:03.586 --> 00:36:05.186]  And they're like, no, you're the crazy person.
[00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:07.067]  And the average trendy goes, okay, kill babies.
[00:36:07.127 --> 00:36:07.527]  I'm trendy.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.920]  And you're like, well, this all sounds crazy.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.382]  Yeah, the Aztecs cutting people's hearts out every day to make the sun come up, they thought was crazy.
[00:36:15.642 --> 00:36:17.122]  Hitler killing all those people was crazy.
[00:36:18.202 --> 00:36:22.103]  90 plus percent of the time, governments are run by total lunatics that love to murder people.
[00:36:22.464 --> 00:36:23.004]  You know why?
[00:36:23.084 --> 00:36:24.704]  Because good people don't stand up to them.
[00:36:25.364 --> 00:36:28.225]  Humans have a pre-designed system to give in to authority.
[00:36:28.805 --> 00:36:35.047]  So authorities wear crowns, big uniforms, badges, and we bend over and lick their boots.
[00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:42.033]  And government publicly says it's setting up a global government to kill everybody.
[00:36:43.274 --> 00:36:46.797]  For the New World Order, global government is just the beginning.
[00:36:47.077 --> 00:36:52.581]  Once it's in place, everything that they have been beta testing will come to fruition.
[00:36:52.782 --> 00:36:53.922]  Here it is, Wired Magazine.
[00:36:54.303 --> 00:36:56.945]  Uncle Sam, if it ends in a comm, it's seizable.
[00:36:58.286 --> 00:36:59.567]  Even in foreign countries.
[00:37:00.247 --> 00:37:00.848]  When U.S.
[00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:04.791]  authorities, not servants, shuttered sports-wearing site
[00:37:06.124 --> 00:37:07.525]  Who do you think set up the web?
[00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.405]  The Pentagon.
[00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:09.946]  They gave it to VeriSign.
[00:37:27.844 --> 00:37:28.565]  And it goes on.
[00:37:28.645 --> 00:37:31.748]  Contracted to manage the coveted dot com.
[00:37:31.768 --> 00:37:35.191]  Yeah, they say under that it's under the Commerce Clause, just because it says com.
[00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:36.092]  That was always the plan.
[00:37:36.573 --> 00:37:38.374]  And other generic top-level domains.
[00:37:40.657 --> 00:37:43.119]  Easy DNS Internet Infrastructure Company.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:51.587]  Protests of the ramifications of this are no less than chilling every single organization branded or operating under com, net, org, biz, etc.
[00:37:53.086 --> 00:37:57.249]  And the Feds go on to say, we will take any website anytime we want, period.
[00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:58.510]  Okay?
[00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:05.574]  I mean, folks, there are cases every week now where they go grab giant internet service provider companies.
[00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:08.476]  In some cases, one case had over a million websites.
[00:38:09.317 --> 00:38:10.918]  Thousands and thousands of customers.
[00:38:12.339 --> 00:38:14.000]  One gambling site
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.103]  That just let people go find legal gambling sites.
[00:38:18.123 --> 00:38:19.003]  It was like an index.
[00:38:19.404 --> 00:38:20.805]  Like a yellow page that shut it down.
[00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:32.575]  They had a... The Fed sees a whole internet service provider company because there was one site with a message board and somebody linked to a song you could download.
[00:38:33.567 --> 00:38:36.488]  And they took tens of thousands of domains.
[00:38:36.508 --> 00:38:45.132]  It was hotels domains, racetracks, restaurants, dentists, and the feds just said, it's all ours.
[00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:47.093]  And you're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:38:48.074 --> 00:38:49.455]  Why would they want to discredit themselves?
[00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:52.796]  No, they're teaching you they're going to do what they want.
[00:38:53.356 --> 00:38:56.598]  They've got picked federal juries, 98% conviction rates.
[00:38:57.078 --> 00:38:58.399]  They're shipping narcotics in.
[00:38:59.454 --> 00:39:03.336]  And they can't say no now to the feds that want to kidnap kids and make money off of it.
[00:39:04.397 --> 00:39:13.202]  See, once they're all corrupt, it sinks to the bottom because then nobody can say no to anybody else, and so the most horrible stuff you can imagine is now the norm.
[00:39:17.385 --> 00:39:27.671]  It all starts with prohibition and cops and the FBI being paid off by gangsters to let liquor be sold illegally.
[00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:33.412]  And once they got a taste of that money and being high rollers, it was over.
[00:39:33.572 --> 00:39:43.318]  Once J. Edgar Hoover on record could go to the racetrack every time and always win on the ponies as his little payoff, that's a big way politicians have been paid off for more than 100 years.
[00:39:43.618 --> 00:39:46.760]  You go to the racetrack and you win every time.
[00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:54.105]  Hillary Clinton puts a couple thousand dollars in on cattle futures, makes, you know, hundreds of times what she invested.
[00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:57.007]  She didn't really win the cattle futures, she just was given it.
[00:39:58.402 --> 00:40:00.203]  And Congress gets caught insider trading?
[00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:04.025]  They just say, well, we say it's legal.
[00:40:04.045 --> 00:40:05.146]  Of course, it's not legal.
[00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:09.648]  Okay, I've been ranting here.
[00:40:09.988 --> 00:40:10.849]  I am so wound up.
[00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:12.990]  I've got Chuck Baldwin coming up and I want to get him on, but...
[00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.319]  I feel like I should open the phones up to the military again.
[00:40:16.339 --> 00:40:30.247]  We've got our weekly visit with Bob Chapman coming up, but I haven't even... I did hours and hours of research and preparation this morning at home, and I get in here ready to put on a huge presentation of information and just start ranting at you, desperately trying to get people to wake up.
[00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:38.232]  Let me just restart right here, okay?
[00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:59.996]  Two days ago, as you know, we've linked to the video and the audio, I played it on the Nightly News last night, of Secretary of Defense Panetta, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman, telling the Senate Committee that we don't come to you to launch wars now, we go to the UN.
[00:41:00.577 --> 00:41:01.918]  So not only is the President
[00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.891]  They're saying a dictator.
[00:41:04.732 --> 00:41:05.973]  That's the essence of it.
[00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:13.419]  In mainline history, mainline jurisprudence, this is what's taught 101 in law school, okay?
[00:41:13.779 --> 00:41:14.079]  This is 101.
[00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.663]  This is the royal flush of tyranny.
[00:41:19.403 --> 00:41:20.745]  But they went one further.
[00:41:22.306 --> 00:41:29.372]  Not only are they saying the president's a dictator, which is total treason, high treason, high crime, and legislation's been introduced to begin impeachment.
[00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:32.060]  Saying it's a high crime in the Constitution.
[00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:33.622]  High crime, folks.
[00:41:33.982 --> 00:41:37.567]  That's punishable by... Well, go read the statute.
[00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.854]  The New World Order will not be outdone by Caesar.
[00:41:43.514 --> 00:41:44.115]  Or by Hitler.
[00:41:45.277 --> 00:41:45.918]  No, sir!
[00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:48.040]  No, sir!
[00:41:50.353 --> 00:41:51.413]  They've got to go further.
[00:41:52.114 --> 00:41:57.336]  They say, we don't say the presidency has this power, we get it from the UN and NATO.
[00:41:57.676 --> 00:41:59.717]  And I've played the clip over and over again, you can go watch it.
[00:42:00.057 --> 00:42:05.479]  It's in the article, coup d'etat, coup d'etat, Pentagon, and Obama declared Congress ceremonial.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.980]  They pretty much abolished Congress.
[00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:11.421]  You know, Caesar kept the Senate around.
[00:42:13.562 --> 00:42:17.544]  Kind of was like a think tank, you know, he'd hear what they had to say, but he had the final word.
[00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:22.066]  I mean, history repeats itself.
[00:42:22.566 --> 00:42:23.607]  This didn't just happen in Rome.
[00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:26.470]  It's happened over and over and over and over again.
[00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.592]  So I thought I would explain to everybody exactly what's happening here.
[00:42:30.733 --> 00:42:33.175]  The exact same development is happening in Europe.
[00:42:33.235 --> 00:42:36.618]  They get the countries to sign on to the bureaucracy of the EU.
[00:42:37.058 --> 00:42:49.268]  Then the bureaucracy gets the traitorous people that they financed into politics in every country in the EU, France, Germany, all of them, to sign over national sovereignty and treaties to the new private banking arm.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.480]  You know it's the G20.
[00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:57.683]  Then the G20 has their operatives, all former Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, Bank of England on record, and Bundesbank.
[00:42:59.064 --> 00:43:01.465]  Sign on to 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:43:01.505 --> 00:43:02.426]  We've been signed on as well.
[00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.507]  Just made up, like I put 1.5 quadrillion in a computer.
[00:43:05.867 --> 00:43:07.528]  I have the politicians sign on to the debt.
[00:43:07.928 --> 00:43:11.690]  I have the corporate whore media I own as a globalist banker, as a Rothschild Rockefeller type.
[00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:14.491]  Say that it's our debt and that we owe it.
[00:43:15.832 --> 00:43:17.113]  The public's not paying attention.
[00:43:18.188 --> 00:43:28.607]  Then I raise taxes, cut benefits, to put the economy into free fall, so that when things go into total depression, I can come in with the tens of trillions I've just gotten in bailout.
[00:43:29.881 --> 00:43:33.844]  And buy everything up, but I never use the money to sure up the derivatives.
[00:43:33.984 --> 00:43:37.087]  I keep growing those and telling folks too big to fail.
[00:43:37.607 --> 00:43:41.370]  So you go down with the ship, I go down with the ship, but the bankers come out dominating.
[00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.531]  And here's Time Magazine.
[00:43:43.092 --> 00:43:44.473]  Resume change in Europe.
[00:43:44.753 --> 00:43:46.394]  Do Greece and Italy amount to a banker's coup?
[00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:51.258]  And they go on to say it is a banker's coup, but it's a good thing the bankers know how to fix it, because they did it.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.620]  Here's another one.
[00:43:54.221 --> 00:43:54.841]  Banker coup.
[00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:56.262]  Goldman Sachs takes over Europe.
[00:43:56.803 --> 00:43:57.703]  Other mainstream articles.
[00:43:57.744 --> 00:43:59.145]  You can go read all of this, okay?
[00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:02.898]  Banker Coup, Time Magazine.
[00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:24.652]  Now, the exact same banks that run Amarillo Lockheed and all the rest of these globalists, all the rest of these New World Order trash, they are now going before Congress and saying, you have no authority, you run nothing, you are nothing.
[00:44:26.353 --> 00:44:27.834]  And the Congress is getting angry.
[00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:38.672]  But you see, the CIA that represents the foreign banks and the foreign corporate takeover occupation, this is a literal banker occupation.
[00:44:39.752 --> 00:44:42.692]  On record, they call it that themselves at Davos and everywhere.
[00:44:42.732 --> 00:44:43.773]  I mean, they think it's very funny.
[00:44:44.493 --> 00:44:45.433]  This is very funny to them.
[00:44:46.013 --> 00:44:52.434]  I have a Reuters article that I didn't make a big enough deal about yesterday where they say, we're modeling this after the NDAA of America.
[00:44:52.474 --> 00:44:55.835]  We will now secretly arrest whoever we want and disappear them and kill them.
[00:44:57.017 --> 00:45:04.579]  And our own State Department's not criticizing it because now the Communist Chinese are getting aid and comfort from their globalist partners that run our country.
[00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:09.120]  Because the bankers have invested and set tax laws to move everything to China that they've made a deal with.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:15.161]  China is now rolling back reforms and saying, yeah, we'll secretly arrest.
[00:45:15.361 --> 00:45:17.522]  In the past, they didn't put it on paper, they just did it.
[00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:23.519]  You think your pension's safe?
[00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:24.720]  You think your children are safe?
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.980]  You think your culture's safe?
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:33.202]  When the government's run by people that openly say they'll kill citizens secretly or kidnap you and put a bag over your head?
[00:45:33.683 --> 00:45:39.825]  So they can now go into black op groups and private corporations and mercenaries and tell them, go kill Andrew Breitbart.
[00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:42.125]  Go kill Alex Jones.
[00:45:42.165 --> 00:45:43.186]  Go kill Matt Drudge.
[00:45:43.226 --> 00:45:43.986]  Go kill whoever.
[00:45:46.347 --> 00:45:47.547]  Go kill the DC Madam.
[00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:57.093]  You understand, they wouldn't be openly pushing torture like they did 10 years ago if they weren't going to try to deploy it and sell it.
[00:45:57.173 --> 00:45:57.633]  And they did.
[00:45:58.154 --> 00:46:01.996]  They're not pushing secretly killing citizens because they just want to come out and do that.
[00:46:02.196 --> 00:46:03.837]  They're doing that because it's already going on.
[00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:06.499]  It's already going on.
[00:46:06.539 --> 00:46:07.480]  It's been going on a long time.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.501]  But they don't want to be blackmailed with it.
[00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:10.482]  They want it legal.
[00:46:11.863 --> 00:46:25.211]  Even though you can't legalize crime, those laws are null and void, and them passing these laws is the total conviction proof, in their own words, of their criminality and treason and the fact that they're a danger.
[00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:28.913]  But we're all in grave danger.
[00:46:30.015 --> 00:46:32.600]  All of us are in grave danger.
[00:46:33.261 --> 00:46:42.076]  If you're not getting chills, ladies and gentlemen, if you aren't absolutely burning with a desire to get fully informed on this and inform others and resist it.
[00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:56.301]  And if you're not preparing to resist this by every means necessary in the Infowar, and to defend yourself by every means, including physical, which is your ancient right, then you're not living in reality.
[00:46:56.581 --> 00:47:04.287]  Or if you're scared, then you better join this and serve evil, which you'll be destroyed, guaranteed, by them.
[00:47:05.188 --> 00:47:06.989]  Or you can run, but you can't hide.
[00:47:07.029 --> 00:47:08.050]  This is a world government.
[00:47:08.988 --> 00:47:12.270]  You have been warned, you have been told, you have been put on record.
[00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:21.135]  I am here in the face going head up directly against the most evil system the world has ever seen because it's uncloaking itself now.
[00:47:22.496 --> 00:47:31.421]  And my power and my prestige is going to rise as everything I've talked about unfolds and as I directly challenge them.
[00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.483]  And you're like, oh great, an egomaniac.
[00:47:35.523 --> 00:47:36.284]  No, the opposite.
[00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:38.918]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:47:41.724 --> 00:47:48.296]  As I do my duty and rise up against this, that is when I enter the maximum danger.
[00:47:49.261 --> 00:47:56.123]  Those of you out there on average who fight this tyranny, you are in much greater danger not speaking out against it because it'll come into fruition and target everyone.
[00:47:56.503 --> 00:47:57.203]  It targets everyone.
[00:47:57.363 --> 00:47:58.743]  People say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:47:59.263 --> 00:48:01.564]  I don't care if they're setting up tyranny.
[00:48:01.884 --> 00:48:02.784]  I'm just going to go along with it.
[00:48:02.944 --> 00:48:04.124]  They want to feed on you.
[00:48:04.284 --> 00:48:05.205]  They want to bully you.
[00:48:05.445 --> 00:48:06.585]  They want to cut your wages.
[00:48:06.625 --> 00:48:07.905]  They want to take everything you've got.
[00:48:08.145 --> 00:48:09.726]  They want to euthanize you when you're old.
[00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:10.646]  Bill Gates has said it.
[00:48:12.546 --> 00:48:13.847]  Don't you understand that?
[00:48:14.807 --> 00:48:15.807]  Don't you get that?
[00:48:22.506 --> 00:48:23.806]  History is happening right now.
[00:48:23.826 --> 00:48:24.207]  Do you hear it?
[00:48:24.867 --> 00:48:25.267]  Do you hear it?
[00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:29.548]  In the silence you hear the clash of arms across the world.
[00:48:29.588 --> 00:48:37.931]  You hear the young, the children being persecuted, the million dead Iraqis, the 40-plus thousand dead Libyans, the Al-Qaeda forces slaughtering them en masse as we speak.
[00:48:37.951 --> 00:48:40.812]  And it's all admitted, but it's humanitarian and liberal, so it's good.
[00:48:41.672 --> 00:48:43.133]  The 51 million aborted babies.
[00:48:43.193 --> 00:48:44.453]  Now they say kill living babies.
[00:48:44.673 --> 00:48:47.314]  Now they say kill grandma on the cover of Newsweek.
[00:48:51.582 --> 00:48:58.744]  Man Cal sent me a mainstream news articles where universities are now promoting the legalization of pedophilia and having group meetings pushing it.
[00:48:58.764 --> 00:49:05.046]  I mean, it's just... And then you understand, we're the ones that are going to be persecuted because we're not turned over to evil.
[00:49:06.246 --> 00:49:07.246]  Do you get that?
[00:49:07.747 --> 00:49:12.988]  When wickedness takes over, it doesn't just go after the good, it goes after everything because that's its nature.
[00:49:20.322 --> 00:49:23.925]  I'm calling all of those who want to stand for liberty and justice.
[00:49:24.005 --> 00:49:38.497]  I'm calling for everyone out there who loves freedom to really think about which side you're gonna be on because that's what's important.
[00:49:39.598 --> 00:49:43.561]  Make a decision what side you're on and then put it into action.
[00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:45.983]  But the decision is the most important point.
[00:49:47.219 --> 00:49:49.259]  And you know what your heart and your soul wants.
[00:49:49.299 --> 00:49:51.080]  You want to make the decision to fight evil.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.240]  But your flesh is afraid.
[00:49:53.941 --> 00:49:55.941]  Go through that fear and find your humanity.
[00:49:57.001 --> 00:50:00.902]  Step across on faith and say, God, I don't know what's going to happen to me.
[00:50:01.882 --> 00:50:02.983]  And I'm not worried about that.
[00:50:03.903 --> 00:50:08.884]  Whatever your will is, just use me as an instrument against this darkness to defend the innocent.
[00:50:10.265 --> 00:50:12.246]  Now I have some really good news when we come back from break.
[00:50:13.246 --> 00:50:27.430]  The legislation in the Senate and the House is picking up steam very quickly to begin impeachment proceedings against President Obama if he does not immediately seek congressional approval for all military actions that are unauthorized.
[00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:31.391]  And so now this issue is starting to come to a head, and this is good.
[00:50:32.212 --> 00:50:39.634]  The enemy is testing us right now to see if they can fully engage in a public coup over this Republican, over Congress.
[00:50:40.558 --> 00:50:55.156]  I'm going to give you the number to the Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment proceedings and the general number to promote the piece of legislation with the legislation number introduced in the House by Walter Jones of North Carolina.
[00:50:56.297 --> 00:50:58.440]  We're going to fight back against this wickedness straight ahead.
[00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:05.004]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:51:05.284 --> 00:51:17.357]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[00:52:02.574 --> 00:52:07.317]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.478]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:52:09.618 --> 00:52:12.799]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.462]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[00:52:17.642 --> 00:52:20.323]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:52:20.624 --> 00:52:24.846]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:52:25.126 --> 00:52:30.869]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:32.770]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:57.279]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:52:59.028 --> 00:53:04.032]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:18.484 --> 00:54:20.945]  Okay, continuing here with the news.
[00:54:22.305 --> 00:54:25.766]  Legislation has been introduced for high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:54:26.506 --> 00:54:35.308]  If the president does not respond and seek congressional authorization and approval for military actions, it's supposed to be a declaration of war.
[00:54:35.328 --> 00:54:38.129]  So you guys have gotten away from doing things for a long time.
[00:54:39.458 --> 00:54:43.961]  If the President doesn't do that, impeachment will begin for high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:54:44.362 --> 00:54:48.205]  Look, this is worse than just launching wars without congressional approval.
[00:54:48.245 --> 00:54:48.825]  It is treason.
[00:54:49.465 --> 00:54:51.827]  You gotta go to Congress or the President just becomes a dictator.
[00:54:52.227 --> 00:54:54.289]  The President wants to use the military domestically.
[00:54:54.609 --> 00:54:56.511]  The President wants to secretly arrest Americans.
[00:54:56.851 --> 00:55:01.895]  And the Congress treasonously voted to give him that illegitimate power in the NDAA.
[00:55:02.295 --> 00:55:03.556]  What do you expect?
[00:55:05.663 --> 00:55:07.624]  And then I expand out from there.
[00:55:08.365 --> 00:55:11.026]  I have the House Judiciary Committee number.
[00:55:11.867 --> 00:55:19.651]  The direct number that you can call them and contact them at and tell them, listen, I understand you're criminals.
[00:55:20.091 --> 00:55:21.372]  I understand you're insider trading.
[00:55:21.872 --> 00:55:23.954]  I understand you're involved in all sorts of crimes.
[00:55:24.884 --> 00:55:27.927]  But you can't let total martial law come into America.
[00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:29.488]  Don't you see crooks?
[00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:31.190]  They're even stealing your power.
[00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.972]  So, go in there and block this U.N.
[00:55:34.012 --> 00:55:37.095]  takeover of America, and we want impeachment for the Libya war.
[00:55:37.376 --> 00:55:41.239]  Obama already sent you a letter saying, I don't need your authorization, I have the U.N.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.481]  We want impeachment for Libya!
[00:55:44.482 --> 00:55:44.802]  Now!
[00:55:45.819 --> 00:55:46.420]  And we want it!
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:59.252]  We want investigations, and we want Panetta and all them called back down, and they need to be impeached on the spot, and then criminally charged for treason and espionage for foreign corporate powers.
[00:56:00.823 --> 00:56:05.548]  If they do not recant immediately and admit their un-American activities.
[00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:08.211]  Again, we're always thinking of some boogeyman.
[00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:10.173]  We're always thinking of some foreign enemy.
[00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:14.838]  We're always taught to be scared of some, you know, new person the media tells us about.
[00:56:15.058 --> 00:56:19.122]  The threat is this global corporate takeover of our republic.
[00:56:19.883 --> 00:56:20.964]  That is the threat.
[00:56:22.385 --> 00:56:23.767]  Here is the Judiciary Committee
[00:56:25.191 --> 00:56:32.116]  Number in Washington, 202-225-3951.
[00:56:32.136 --> 00:56:35.379]  202-225-3951.
[00:56:35.399 --> 00:56:37.260]  202-225-3951.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.481]  202-225-3951.
[00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:40.202]  Lamar Smith is over it.
[00:56:40.623 --> 00:56:43.865]  Acts like a conservative, total pro-war globalist operative.
[00:56:44.185 --> 00:56:45.226]  Call and let him know that.
[00:56:45.766 --> 00:56:52.331]  Sheriff Mack's running against him, so tell him we're gonna be getting behind Mack if he doesn't at least make some noises and get Obama on the carpet for this.
[00:56:52.391 --> 00:56:54.253]  Call Lamar Globalist Smith.
[00:56:57.926 --> 00:56:59.788]  202-225-4236.
[00:56:59.808 --> 00:57:01.449]  202-225-4236.
[00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:06.554]  And let's make this the biggest news issue and biggest news item out there.
[00:57:06.974 --> 00:57:08.716]  Make it the big issue on talk radio.
[00:57:09.096 --> 00:57:09.997]  Make it the big issue.
[00:57:10.057 --> 00:57:12.919]  Force it out there to have a national debate about this.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.723]  They want to just waddle in there without a bang but with a whimper and do this.
[00:57:17.743 --> 00:57:18.844]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:57:19.245 --> 00:57:23.668]  FBI director fails to refute state-sponsored murder of American citizens on U.S.
[00:57:23.729 --> 00:57:23.969]  soil.
[00:57:25.674 --> 00:57:26.815]  We got video of that.
[00:57:28.457 --> 00:57:35.606]  Continuing, K-O-N-Y, Kony 2012, African invasion, PSYOP, key report on that.
[00:57:36.407 --> 00:57:42.194]  Now they got a new boogeyman they're comparing to Hitler, and we gotta invade Africa because some guy's got 500 followers out in the bushes.
[00:57:43.115 --> 00:57:45.078]  Fifth Amendment dead in America.
[00:57:46.223 --> 00:57:47.043]  Big report on that.
[00:57:47.103 --> 00:57:51.385]  TSA threatens mainstream media reporters over coverage of body scanner story.
[00:57:51.705 --> 00:57:53.665]  Steve Watson, huge news.
[00:57:54.606 --> 00:57:57.567]  Had one of the reporters on last night.
[00:57:57.987 --> 00:57:58.847]  Coup d'etat.
[00:57:59.107 --> 00:58:01.688]  Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial.
[00:58:01.848 --> 00:58:07.350]  That's the key article, linked and read on InfoWars.com that we've got to get out to everybody.
[00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.030]  And there's some good news.
[00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:13.612]  Virginia State Senate passes bill forbidding indefinite detention of Americans.
[00:58:14.537 --> 00:58:18.919]  Folks, they're saying they're going to throw a bag over your head and disappear you.
[00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:20.280]  That's illegal.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.660]  That's the essence of tyranny.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:26.423]  That's the government admitting it's illegitimate and an incredible danger to everyone.
[00:58:26.463 --> 00:58:27.543]  This is a no-brainer.
[00:58:27.983 --> 00:58:29.564]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[00:58:29.904 --> 00:58:30.905]  There is no debating.
[00:58:31.185 --> 00:58:32.405]  There is no discussion.
[00:58:32.625 --> 00:58:33.766]  There is no argument.
[00:58:34.066 --> 00:58:36.207]  America is being taken over.
[00:58:36.287 --> 00:58:37.708]  Defend the Republic!
[00:58:42.504 --> 00:58:46.265]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:55.488]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:56.688 --> 00:59:01.430]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:08.392]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.685]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[00:59:14.629 --> 00:59:16.974]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:59:19.042 --> 00:59:22.905]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:26.768]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:59:27.468 --> 00:59:28.289]  Others don't.
[00:59:28.709 --> 00:59:30.590]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.352]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:32.632 --> 00:59:35.194]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:35.514 --> 00:59:41.778]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:42.138 --> 00:59:44.340]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.882]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:59:47.222 --> 00:59:48.083]  Others don't.
[00:59:52.532 --> 00:59:54.433]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.913 --> 00:59:57.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.356 --> 01:00:05.016]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.676 --> 01:00:06.737]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.597]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.197 --> 01:00:10.018]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.778 --> 01:00:11.718]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.698 --> 01:00:15.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.066 --> 01:00:27.248]  The American people have gotten this attitude that tyranny, corruption can't happen here.
[01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:35.913]  So now the world marvels at TSA groping us, and body scanners, and checkpoints, and police beating people, and taser deaths every day.
[01:00:37.494 --> 01:00:40.075]  Our tourism's down $40 billion a year and growing.
[01:00:40.115 --> 01:00:41.216]  I mean, no one will come here.
[01:00:42.262 --> 01:00:45.085]  Everyone is in abject fear of entering this zone.
[01:00:45.866 --> 01:00:48.489]  And now they're going after what's left, the free speech, the internet.
[01:00:48.889 --> 01:00:50.310]  They're saying they'll secretly arrest you.
[01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:57.498]  And then you've got one group of Americans who get more and more delusional, like Soviet Russians or something, who will just do whatever they're told.
[01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:00.501]  And they will drink deeply of the Kool-Aid.
[01:01:00.821 --> 01:01:02.263]  If Jim Jones said drink Kool-Aid
[01:01:18.735 --> 01:01:39.440]  Just because a bunch of you want to be slaves and like foreign banks running you and think it's great 12 years ago they signed secret deals now public to steal all the military death benefits of troops and you just think it's fun to have Bank of America and others taking people's houses that were completely paid for and they didn't have the deed to and you think it's great to have the Federal Reserve you know giving itself tens of trillions of our tax money and you think it's great?
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.040]  I mean, you think it's great?
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:41.681]  Well, you know what?
[01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:55.247]  I don't have to be a slave just because you want to be a slave and call me a kook, because I'm super-informed, super-involved, super-active, super-red-blooded, as Americana as it gets, baby.
[01:01:55.747 --> 01:01:59.309]  I'm an American, but more importantly, I'm a human being who loves liberty.
[01:01:59.729 --> 01:02:00.289]  And you're not.
[01:02:00.529 --> 01:02:02.590]  You're a timid, boot-licking creature.
[01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:03.531]  What did Patrick Henry say?
[01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.692]  Forget that you are our countryman, our brotherman.
[01:02:06.468 --> 01:02:08.309]  Forget that you are our countrymen and our brethren.
[01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:09.690]  Will you guys print me the Patrick Henry speech?
[01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:10.030]  Thank you.
[01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:11.691]  Anna Cicero, again, I forgot to read it.
[01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:12.051]  Thank you.
[01:02:14.072 --> 01:02:16.454]  May the chains set lightly upon you.
[01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:17.594]  Just Patrick Henry speech.
[01:02:18.015 --> 01:02:19.576]  May the chains set lightly upon you.
[01:02:19.596 --> 01:02:20.096]  That'll pull it up.
[01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:25.692]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:02:25.832 --> 01:02:26.793]  Enjoy!
[01:02:26.813 --> 01:02:29.795]  Oh, you've got a wonderful life!
[01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:31.256]  Enjoy it!
[01:02:31.396 --> 01:02:32.376]  Cowarding and fear.
[01:02:32.697 --> 01:02:36.639]  You know, real cowards don't even ever get to the level of physical fear or conscious fear.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.862]  They're afraid of just being looked at and not being trendy.
[01:02:41.202 --> 01:02:49.508]  And so they tell them, hey, live in slavery, total abject collapse of your society, drones bombing you, taser deaths, checkpoints, being groped.
[01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:52.490]  They're like, point me in that direction immediately.
[01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:57.991]  I mean, if that's what some bimbo reading off a teleprompter says, then I want to be a slave.
[01:02:58.271 --> 01:02:59.211]  I want to be an idiot.
[01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:00.772]  I want to be a moron.
[01:03:03.552 --> 01:03:17.715]  Under austerity, they plan to jack up the property taxes, have carbon taxes, have VAT, money transfer taxes, Tobin taxes, wellhead taxes, and there are those articles I see every few days about the economy shutting down.
[01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:19.636]  It's good for lowering our carbon footprint.
[01:03:20.116 --> 01:03:20.936]  Hey, it's great!
[01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:24.919]  The Fortune 100 are all making record profits, but everything else is imploding.
[01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:28.102]  Hey, all these old restaurants and clothing stores are all shutting down.
[01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:30.444]  Hey, people don't have money for gas.
[01:03:30.484 --> 01:03:31.305]  Hey, it's great!
[01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:33.146]  It's great, man!
[01:03:33.206 --> 01:03:34.347]  Isn't that great?
[01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:35.428]  Isn't the New World Order great?
[01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:37.330]  Isn't it great?
[01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:42.535]  Oh, but it's fun to be scared of Al-Qaeda that publicly works for the government and is being used to attack all these countries.
[01:03:42.555 --> 01:03:48.140]  You know, in our hour of danger, the FBI director said we may have to kill Americans secretly in America.
[01:03:49.753 --> 01:03:55.257]  Because, you know, the hour of danger is not this government, you know, that is setting up the greatest threat against us.
[01:03:55.317 --> 01:03:56.238]  No, it's Al Qaeda!
[01:03:57.339 --> 01:03:58.480]  This hour of danger?
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.262]  Ten years since the 9-11 attacks?
[01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:04.924]  That were as phony as a $7 bill?
[01:04:05.024 --> 01:04:09.088]  All right, I'm now entering rant phase.
[01:04:09.328 --> 01:04:16.273]  We've got Pastor Chuck Baldwin coming up to talk about his excellent book that, by the way, we're carrying at the InfoWars.com store, Romans 13.
[01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:20.793]  And you may all know about Romans 13.
[01:04:20.853 --> 01:04:27.462]  You may know that it's out of context that you're supposed to find the nearest tyrant and start worshipping them, because that's what God says.
[01:04:27.482 --> 01:04:34.111]  And they've got the clergy response team newscast where they say the preachers are taught to tell you to go to the nearest FEMA camp.
[01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:36.352]  By the way, I'm not joking about that.
[01:04:36.993 --> 01:04:39.816]  Well, this needs to be given to your police chief, your pastor.
[01:04:40.256 --> 01:04:41.457]  Talk about a key info weapon.
[01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:43.199]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.723]  It's only 130-something, 144 pages total.
[01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.265]  Long, full of quotes.
[01:04:49.405 --> 01:04:50.306]  Very easy read.
[01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:52.268]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:52.648 --> 01:04:56.532]  A key weapon, just like the Agenda 21 book at InfoWars.com is.
[01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:57.793]  Behind the green mask.
[01:04:57.993 --> 01:04:58.534]  Get it to everybody.
[01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:02.199]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.419 --> 01:05:07.444]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:07.724 --> 01:05:09.085]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:09.266 --> 01:05:18.054]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:18.775 --> 01:05:25.880]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:33.925]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.326 --> 01:05:44.052]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you've had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:44.072 --> 01:05:44.692]  Take charge
[01:05:49.397 --> 01:05:51.985]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com
[01:05:59.358 --> 01:06:06.322]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:24.192]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:06:24.453 --> 01:06:28.575]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:30.436]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:06:30.616 --> 01:06:38.462]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:06:38.782 --> 01:06:44.866]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:06:45.086 --> 01:06:46.127]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:47.107]  It's incredible.

[01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:04.418]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[01:07:49.748 --> 01:07:52.449]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:08:04.434 --> 01:08:08.639]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:10.080]  You want answers?
[01:08:10.861 --> 01:08:12.323]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.403 --> 01:08:16.007]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.587 --> 01:08:20.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.445 --> 01:08:48.082]  Well, it's really an opportune time, a fortuitous time to get Pastor Chuck Baldwin on, who of course also ran for president back in 08 on the Constitution Party.
[01:08:48.102 --> 01:08:49.343]  It's a good time to get him on.
[01:08:50.799 --> 01:08:53.741]  Because we have decisions to make in this country.
[01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.221]  Who we're going to serve?
[01:08:55.482 --> 01:09:06.348]  God, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, common sense, our heritage, or this global corporate fascist, crony capitalist, anti-free market, New World Order?
[01:09:06.868 --> 01:09:10.790]  The book is Romans 13, the true meaning of submission, second edition.
[01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:13.712]  Timothy Baldwin and Chuck Baldwin wrote it with his son.
[01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:17.969]  And it is an excellent book.
[01:09:17.989 --> 01:09:21.250]  It's only 144 pages long and breaks down with the scriptures.
[01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:23.910]  Of course, I've read a lot of the Bible, so I know.
[01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:29.871]  I mean, the whole Bible is about people standing up against corrupt governments and rebuking them and many times being killed.
[01:09:30.532 --> 01:09:35.752]  So, the misinterpretation of Romans 13 saying, what was Hitler's favorite verse?
[01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.473]  Stalin used it too with Christians in Ukraine.
[01:09:38.933 --> 01:09:40.433]  You know, God says, submit to government.
[01:09:40.453 --> 01:09:41.873]  Well, that's not what it really says.
[01:09:43.374 --> 01:09:44.414]  Christ and others are saying,
[01:09:45.365 --> 01:09:48.387]  Give to God what's God's and to the state the things that are the state.
[01:09:49.327 --> 01:09:51.589]  But then it's all in a larger context.
[01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:53.290]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:58.593]  And I want to get his take on the fact that everything we warned about is unfortunately unfolding.
[01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:08.278]  Congress being told, we'll play some clips of this as well, that no, we don't come to you for war powers.
[01:10:09.319 --> 01:10:10.219]  We go to the UN.
[01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:13.001]  So not only are they saying, hey, the president
[01:10:13.703 --> 01:10:18.866]  Has the war powers, which is impeachable offense, and impeachment proceedings have been initiated.
[01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:21.327]  We're going to get into that.
[01:10:21.867 --> 01:10:24.088]  But he's saying, I do it for the UN and NATO.
[01:10:24.168 --> 01:10:36.535]  As he said last year in his resolution, when Congress started suing him, 10 members saying, you can't launch a war in Libya and use our troops and military and aircraft without congressional authorization.
[01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:42.078]  They said, well, we have the authorization of the UN and I do it for their credibility.
[01:10:43.567 --> 01:10:45.068]  This is beyond treason.
[01:10:45.148 --> 01:10:46.109]  It is sedition.
[01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:47.851]  It is espionage.
[01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:49.712]  It is a foreign occupation.
[01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:50.893]  It's a coup d'etat.
[01:10:51.354 --> 01:10:54.416]  And our article, linked and read at InfoWars.com, is coup d'etat.
[01:10:54.656 --> 01:10:57.078]  Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial.
[01:10:57.198 --> 01:11:04.845]  On top of that, the head of the FBI, FBI director, fails to refute state-sponsored murder of American citizens on U.S.
[01:11:04.865 --> 01:11:05.165]  soil.
[01:11:05.205 --> 01:11:06.126]  Incredible video.
[01:11:06.546 --> 01:11:07.247]  That's coming up.
[01:11:07.327 --> 01:11:10.350]  And now, Homeland Security is calling mainline reporters
[01:11:11.087 --> 01:11:15.468]  We have copies of the emails, and I've talked to one of the reporters off-record.
[01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:17.528]  I interviewed one of the sources yesterday on-air.
[01:11:18.328 --> 01:11:23.249]  And Homeland Security said, you better not interview that engineer exposing the scanners as frauds.
[01:11:24.429 --> 01:11:25.530]  We're going to give you a warning.
[01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.850]  Don't interview him.
[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:35.411]  State police are now calling 590, our local affiliate, where we're number one in some demographics, number two in the others, telling them, why is Alex Jones on-air?
[01:11:37.212 --> 01:11:38.472]  Trying to get me kicked off the air.
[01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:42.648]  They think they can intimidate the radio station.
[01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:44.169]  Folks, this is so un-American.
[01:11:44.589 --> 01:11:46.049]  It's so anti-freedom, period.
[01:11:46.289 --> 01:11:56.633]  Communist China, I'm going to cover this with Pastor Baldwin, is now passing a secret arrest, secret torture, secret killing bill, and saying, hey, America did it, modeled after the NDAA.
[01:11:56.674 --> 01:11:57.394]  That's Reuters!
[01:11:58.654 --> 01:12:00.095]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:12:02.099 --> 01:12:03.240]  So they're going for broke now.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.861]  They've eaten around the edges for a long time.
[01:12:04.901 --> 01:12:05.861]  Now the slippery slope.
[01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:07.522]  We're going fast down that slide.
[01:12:08.302 --> 01:12:09.603]  But here's a little minute and a half clip.
[01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:19.789]  Three years after I was sent secret Homeland Security documents, just like I was sent in my act, saying the veterans are the number one threat to Homeland Security and gun owners and Ron Paul and Chuck Baldwin and everybody else.
[01:12:19.829 --> 01:12:21.430]  Nobody believed it when I got that, but it was real.
[01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:24.752]  I was given secret documents from two different pastors.
[01:12:25.212 --> 01:12:28.975]  Well, one of them, I was given by Pastor Butch Paul from a pastor.
[01:12:29.015 --> 01:12:29.816]  I talked to the pastor.
[01:12:29.856 --> 01:12:34.299]  Then another one sent me the same info, where they were approached and told, get everybody ready to go to FEMA camps.
[01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:34.980]  We'll pay you.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.321]  This was in Iowa.
[01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:38.202]  And then another one was in Ohio.
[01:12:39.183 --> 01:12:43.206]  And prepare folks and say it's of the Lord to go to the camps during emergencies.
[01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:46.068]  People didn't believe it, even though it had phone numbers and documents.
[01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:49.111]  Then, about a year and a half after, they released
[01:12:50.228 --> 01:12:56.891]  Newscast around the country with preachers saying, martial law, will it ever become a reality in America?
[01:12:57.251 --> 01:12:58.432]  That's how the news clip starts.
[01:12:58.452 --> 01:12:59.793]  The very first word is cut off.
[01:13:00.093 --> 01:13:01.113]  It's the only version we have.
[01:13:02.654 --> 01:13:03.775]  This was in Louisiana.
[01:13:03.815 --> 01:13:04.735]  This aired in New Orleans.
[01:13:05.075 --> 01:13:16.381]  But I've got other newscasts, and I've talked, now it's over 100,000 preachers have been recruited and paid to spy on their flocks and tell them, give their guns up, take the vaccines, go to the camps, when the attack happens.
[01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:20.532]  So, right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:13:20.552 --> 01:13:24.134]  I'll play that clip, go to Chuck Baldwin, because his book is all about this.
[01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:32.200]  And if we reach out and warn the pastors, or identify those that are really homeland security wolves, we can stop these globalists.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.502]  Here's a clip of the preachers turned into secret police.
[01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:39.287]  Has nuclear law ever become a reality in America?
[01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:44.010]  Some fear any nuclear, biological or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.151]  territory might trigger just that.
[01:13:46.592 --> 01:13:53.576]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:13:57.119 --> 01:14:04.384]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[01:14:05.064 --> 01:14:11.288]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[01:14:12.029 --> 01:14:12.269]  U.S.
[01:14:12.329 --> 01:14:20.594]  troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:14:21.075 --> 01:14:22.155]  That forbid U.S.
[01:14:22.216 --> 01:14:24.257]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:33.629]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:39.254]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[01:14:39.754 --> 01:14:46.360]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:52.485]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[01:14:52.985 --> 01:14:59.827]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:07.549]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[01:15:07.889 --> 01:15:09.870]  Specifically, Romans.
[01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:10.210]  Romans 13.
[01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:13.991]  Because the government's established all the law.
[01:15:14.111 --> 01:15:14.491]  You know?
[01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:15.832]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[01:15:15.852 --> 01:15:16.952]  That's what's stated in the Scripture.
[01:15:17.652 --> 01:15:26.478]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[01:15:27.499 --> 01:15:29.200]  Jeff Farrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:40.828]  Now, you noticed, if she goes on to say clergy response teams were used during Katrina for gun confiscation and did a good job, you can just type in clergy response teams into YouTube and watch it.
[01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:47.775]  But we're going to Pastor Chuck Baldwin here, but you notice they said, help the government deal with its biggest threat, we the people.
[01:15:48.496 --> 01:15:51.219]  And that government is above us and we need to learn to serve them.
[01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:53.861]  No, we are the government here in the United States.
[01:15:54.622 --> 01:15:59.086]  That's what the, so I guess George Washington was of the devil to fight the corrupt king.
[01:15:59.406 --> 01:16:02.649]  I guess all the prophets in the Bible who rebuked the kings and stood up.
[01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:06.173]  I guess when John the Baptist went into Herod and said, you're of the devil.
[01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:09.092]  I guess Herod was the good one.
[01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:11.254]  And John the Baptist, he was the baddest.
[01:16:11.314 --> 01:16:13.776]  Christ saying no to governments was bad.
[01:16:13.816 --> 01:16:15.097]  I guess Paul was bad.
[01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:17.259]  According to our devil preachers, they are.
[01:16:17.919 --> 01:16:21.442]  Now again, this book is so well written, so well documented.
[01:16:21.742 --> 01:16:23.344]  Available at InfoWars.com, Romans 13.
[01:16:24.064 --> 01:16:25.365]  Pastor, great to have you here.
[01:16:25.385 --> 01:16:30.309]  I did that big intro here because I wanted people to see an example of how big an issue this is.
[01:16:30.789 --> 01:16:32.491]  What did you think of that little clip we just played?
[01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:37.614]  Yeah, that's incredible, and I'm so glad that you introduced the subject by playing that.
[01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:46.520]  I know pastors myself, we have spoken, and they have showed me the materials that they receive at these training centers.
[01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:51.952]  So the stuff that you talk about, these Closure Response Teams, that's not hyperbole.
[01:16:51.992 --> 01:16:53.113]  That is actuality.
[01:16:53.753 --> 01:16:54.534]  It's reality.
[01:16:54.654 --> 01:16:55.274]  It's happening.
[01:16:56.094 --> 01:17:05.099]  They are trying to prepare pastors in America to be the one who stands up in the pulpit in front of the congregation and encourages them
[01:17:05.796 --> 01:17:06.356]  Please continue, Pastor.
[01:17:25.618 --> 01:17:34.284]  For decades and decades, preachers have been indoctrinated in this fallacious interpretation of Romans Chapter 13.
[01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.305]  Obey the government no matter what.
[01:17:37.226 --> 01:17:38.667]  And this is such a problem.
[01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:47.673]  That coupled with the 501c3 tax exempt status of churches, I think is the one-two whammy as to why the churches in America today are neutered.
[01:17:48.293 --> 01:17:54.958]  So Tim and I, Tim as you know is the constitutional attorney, he's an expert in the Constitution, and he and I collaborated together
[01:17:55.698 --> 01:18:03.148]  And wrote this book on Romans 13 because we just had to get the truth of the real meaning of Romans Chapter 13.
[01:18:03.188 --> 01:18:07.053]  And not just Romans Chapter 13, Alex, but the entire rest of Scripture.
[01:18:07.694 --> 01:18:12.801]  When Paul penned Romans Chapter 13, he was not introducing a new doctrine to the church.
[01:18:13.228 --> 01:18:18.413]  He was simply reiterating what had been stated throughout the Scriptures, Old and New Testament.
[01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:35.690]  So we take the Bible, we go back into the Old Testament, we go through the New Testament, we quote the theologians and the philosophers of early America and beyond that, and we show that the historical teaching of Christianity has never been
[01:18:36.283 --> 01:18:38.164]  To obey the government no matter what.
[01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:40.506]  We believe that government is of God.
[01:18:40.566 --> 01:18:42.808]  We believe that good government is of God.
[01:18:42.868 --> 01:18:57.318]  We believe that we must follow the good principles, that God has established a natural law that relates to all government, whether it's civil or family or business, whatever it might happen to be.
[01:18:57.338 --> 01:18:58.719]  There's all kinds of government.
[01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:07.736]  But that each governing authority has a responsibility to God to obey the principles that God has established in His Word.
[01:19:08.056 --> 01:19:14.040]  That no authority, even civil authority, is above the natural law principles of God.
[01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:29.032]  And so we go back into the Scriptures, both Testaments, hundreds of Scripture references, philosophers and theologians of early America and beyond that, and we prove conclusively that the 2,000 year history of Christianity has always taught
[01:19:29.582 --> 01:19:30.283]  I don't know.
[01:19:41.912 --> 01:19:48.393]  To resist that evil government, and to stand for those sacred principles which God has enshrined in His Word.
[01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:52.794]  And that's why we have the famous quote by the Founders, resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:19:53.014 --> 01:19:53.434]  Exactly.
[01:19:53.474 --> 01:20:03.196]  Ben Franklin said that, and that's why he could say that, because he understood these natural law principles that I'm talking about, as did Jefferson and the rest of the Founding Fathers.
[01:20:03.536 --> 01:20:06.637]  And if we don't get the preachers of America to shake off
[01:20:07.932 --> 01:20:22.263]  This asinine interpretation of Romans Chapter 13, to obey the government no matter what, we are going to repeat the fate and the destiny of Germany, as you just mentioned in your monologue opening this series.
[01:20:23.224 --> 01:20:24.885]  Because that is exactly what he did.
[01:20:24.905 --> 01:20:32.131]  The Nazi regime took Romans Chapter 13, they created entire messages.
[01:20:32.964 --> 01:20:42.588]  Around that fallacious interpretation, sent it out to the churches and the pastors, and then they regurgitated it in their pulpits in Nazi Germany.
[01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:50.071]  The net result was 14,000 evangelical churches in Germany when Hitler was rising to power.
[01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:53.052]  Of those 14,000 evangelical churches, 800
[01:20:57.021 --> 01:21:14.553]  But according to the preachers we played earlier, you should have gotten on your knees and worshipped Hitler or Stalin or Pol Pot or anybody.
[01:21:14.593 --> 01:21:15.974]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:22.999]  I'm not a preacher, but I know Sunday School, the whole Bible is about resisting tyrants and Pharaoh and everybody else.
[01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.200]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:31.269]  I mean, how do preachers with a straight face say, well, go ahead and go along with abortion, the government wants it, we're the government?
[01:21:31.569 --> 01:21:34.533]  Yeah, well, there's several reasons as to why.
[01:21:34.553 --> 01:21:40.442]  I think some of them, it's a matter of cowardice and convenience, quite frankly.
[01:21:41.055 --> 01:21:44.096]  You know, many of them have become glorified politicians.
[01:21:44.777 --> 01:21:46.197]  They're climbing the corporate ladder.
[01:21:46.778 --> 01:21:47.738]  They don't want to make waves.
[01:21:48.338 --> 01:21:49.879]  And they don't want to cause controversy.
[01:21:50.299 --> 01:21:56.142]  You know, they've got their paycheck, they've got their retirement, their 401K, their insurance premiums are paid.
[01:21:56.522 --> 01:21:58.303]  You know, they're sitting very comfortably.
[01:21:58.823 --> 01:22:00.224]  And they don't want to jeopardize that.
[01:22:00.304 --> 01:22:09.387]  And of course, it's that careerism and cover your rear end and don't have any real values that is going to destroy the country and going to destroy everybody's future and career.
[01:22:09.687 --> 01:22:11.888]  That's what all these go along get alongs don't get.
[01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:14.749]  America has been great because we did resist tyranny.
[01:22:14.989 --> 01:22:20.271]  We were far from perfect, but we resisted to the greatest extent and it created incredible blessings.
[01:22:20.531 --> 01:22:25.933]  And now as soon as we ignore what America was founded on, all of our blessings are draining out.
[01:22:27.374 --> 01:22:27.794]  Exactly.
[01:22:28.661 --> 01:22:33.386]  And I think the key is the pulpit, I really do, and that's why Tim and I wrote this book.
[01:22:34.167 --> 01:22:35.709]  I'm so glad you're offering it.
[01:22:35.729 --> 01:22:50.505]  It is absolutely, fundamentally critical that Christians, if we can get the laymen, if we can get the church leaders of America to understand the true meaning of Romans Chapter 13, and begin insisting
[01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:54.407]  That their pulpit teaches the truth relative to Romans 13.
[01:22:55.508 --> 01:22:57.249]  We can see a difference in this country.
[01:22:57.309 --> 01:23:02.451]  The churches have the power to change the direction of the country.
[01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:08.533]  But as long as this fallacious interpretation of Romans 13 is prevalent, nothing is going to be done.
[01:23:08.753 --> 01:23:12.195]  That's why Tim and I wrote Romans Chapter 13, the true meaning of submission.
[01:23:15.683 --> 01:23:18.968]  Well, you're right, and that's why I'm promoting this book.
[01:23:19.568 --> 01:23:28.060]  I see it as a key weapon of truth against the corruption of the globalists, to at least educate people in the churches and the pastors that can be reached.
[01:23:28.843 --> 01:23:43.155]  With this information, I've talked to some people that go in and ask their pastor, even of many years in some cases, about the Clergy Response Team, and suddenly the preacher calls them behind closed doors, starts asking them questions, tells them, don't go down that road, I don't want to have to report you.
[01:23:43.175 --> 01:23:55.205]  I mean, these preachers think they're living in East Germany or in Communist China during the Christian purges to sit there and say, I don't want to have to report you, as if it's illegal to say, hey, you're not in a secret
[01:23:55.885 --> 01:23:57.647]  A relationship with the government, are you?
[01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:03.773]  I mean, it's so bizarre that how these preachers get into the role of classic spies.
[01:24:04.834 --> 01:24:10.859]  I mean, just like they have the preacher and the mayor are the bad guys and are the collaborators in Red Dawn, which is fictitious.
[01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:12.661]  That was made back in the early 80s.
[01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:17.706]  You know, everybody hissed at them in the movie theater when I was a little kid going to see that with my dad.
[01:24:18.226 --> 01:24:23.209]  I mean, everybody, even as a kid, I knew the bad guy was the person, you know, spying on the citizens.
[01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:26.471]  And now they're like, you better be quiet.
[01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:27.891]  Yes, I do work for Homeland.
[01:24:28.211 --> 01:24:29.192]  How do you know about this?
[01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:35.776]  Like they get off on, I have secret meetings with Homeland Security and I spy on my flock and I've talked to
[01:24:37.575 --> 01:24:52.310]  High-level Baptist preachers here in town, after some of their members told me about it, and they hand out at the big churches sheets saying don't even discuss politics or issues at church barbecues at the park or in the pews because of separation of church and state.
[01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:57.695]  But then Obama, as you know, two weeks ago put out a film calling on, quote,
[01:24:58.567 --> 01:24:58.727]  I don't
[01:25:17.938 --> 01:25:30.505]  But churches can do whatever they want, so he knows it's a buffalo telling churches you can't believe politically involved, but they selectively threaten the 501c3, while at the same time using the churches for their own aims.
[01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:35.568]  But how did they get preachers to be such incredible agents of government?
[01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:38.830]  Boy, that is a great question.
[01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:43.173]  You know, I was very involved in the moral majority, as you know, back in the
[01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:49.527]  In the 80s, Dr. Jerry Fallow asked me to be the Executive Director of the Florida Moral Majority, which I was.
[01:25:49.587 --> 01:26:00.912]  I really saw the inside of all of that, and there was a progression that took place, or a decrescent, I don't want to say it, that took place during that time.
[01:26:01.712 --> 01:26:07.855]  I think what happened was, and this is what I believe, having experienced it,
[01:26:08.813 --> 01:26:12.154]  First hand and seeing the inside of how all that worked and how it developed.
[01:26:12.854 --> 01:26:29.059]  Alex, I really believe what happened was the preachers and the Christian leaders, the so-called religious right in America during that time were so desirous to obtain a seat at the table.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:36.002]  And that's a phrase that I heard at a national press conference I was president at in Washington, D.C.
[01:26:36.042 --> 01:26:36.782]  when Gary Bauer
[01:26:37.913 --> 01:26:38.694]  Actually said that.
[01:26:39.475 --> 01:26:41.118]  All we want is a seat at the table.
[01:26:42.299 --> 01:26:45.544]  Well, they got their seat at the table.
[01:26:45.564 --> 01:26:53.836]  And once they tasted the benefits and the luxuries of being able to sit at the king's table,
[01:26:54.737 --> 01:26:59.858]  Uh, they made a decision that that's what they wanted and they were not going to give it up no matter what.
[01:27:00.478 --> 01:27:15.601]  And the principles and convictions that drove them to get involved and to try and make a difference in our country back there in the late 70s and the early 80s became a desire to seek the King's benefit.
[01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:22.963]  And as a result, since then, the government quickly found the politicals, the power elite, quickly figured out
[01:27:23.777 --> 01:27:30.900]  That these preachers and Christian leaders could be easily bribed through a variety of methods.
[01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:38.344]  Phone calls from the White House, invitations to private dinners... Well, I was about to say, Pastor, I'm glad you're giving us this inside baseball.
[01:27:38.584 --> 01:27:50.190]  I saw the City Council sell out for 50-plus million dollars to help build a Formula One track with our tax money just because they got invited, reportedly in the future, to sit in the box.
[01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:52.070]  With the rich people.
[01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:58.272]  I mean, literally, a lot of times people sell out just to be invited to the party, not even for money.
[01:27:58.292 --> 01:28:04.213]  It's so pathetic what you just pointed out, but then now they're getting money under Bush and now under Obama.
[01:28:04.413 --> 01:28:05.894]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[01:28:06.254 --> 01:28:12.195]  Faith-based initiative, it turns out, secret, you know, vans, big screen TVs, AV equipment.
[01:28:12.535 --> 01:28:15.716]  They even get small churches to sell out for a few thousand dollars
[01:28:16.903 --> 01:28:18.664]  Of government money to churches!
[01:28:18.704 --> 01:28:19.864]  That's totally illegal!
[01:28:19.884 --> 01:28:20.684]  Can you speak to that?
[01:28:20.884 --> 01:28:22.605]  Oh absolutely, yeah.
[01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:26.026]  You and I both railed against that back when G.W.
[01:28:26.066 --> 01:28:35.929]  Bush first introduced that, this whole faith-based initiative program, which took taxpayer dollars and gave them directly to the churches.
[01:28:36.029 --> 01:28:40.570]  And as soon as I found out that was going on, I recognized immediately what was happening.
[01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:42.591]  This was nothing more than a bribe
[01:28:43.388 --> 01:28:48.810]  To silence the churches and to get their cooperation in whatever it was that the government was doing at the time.
[01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:57.074]  And you're right, I mean, they're doing it for their Christian schools, their private schools, they're doing it for many of their so-called missionary projects, etc.
[01:28:57.134 --> 01:28:59.875]  They're getting faith-based initiative monies.
[01:29:00.495 --> 01:29:11.039]  And as a result of that, they're not going to say anything contrary to whatever the government would wish them to do, because they are getting a direct benefit from the government for being
[01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:15.096]  And that's state-run media.
[01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:17.097]  I mean, that's right out of China and Russia.
[01:29:17.497 --> 01:29:19.417]  I mean, under communism, you still had churches.
[01:29:19.457 --> 01:29:21.278]  They were just government-funded and certified.
[01:29:21.618 --> 01:29:23.519]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin's our guest, folks.
[01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:26.680]  The book is Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.682]  I think it dovetails nicely with Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[01:29:31.102 --> 01:29:34.803]  Both these books are key for pastors, members of your flock.
[01:29:35.263 --> 01:29:37.824]  The fight is going on for the heart and soul in these churches.
[01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.465]  Take your churches back.
[01:29:40.025 --> 01:29:42.126]  Not just take your states, counties, and cities back.
[01:29:42.486 --> 01:29:46.189]  Nullify the globalist brainwashing at your church level today.
[01:29:46.289 --> 01:29:48.491]  Get the books at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:48.912 --> 01:29:49.813]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.313 --> 01:29:51.914]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.855 --> 01:29:55.518]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.397 --> 01:30:03.639]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:03.939 --> 01:30:04.560]  Number one.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.022]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.282 --> 01:30:08.862]  Number two.
[01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:13.705]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.045 --> 01:30:14.485]  It's true.
[01:30:14.785 --> 01:30:19.328]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.648 --> 01:30:20.189]  Number 3.
[01:30:20.469 --> 01:30:23.752]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.052 --> 01:30:27.755]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:27.975 --> 01:30:28.516]  Number 4.
[01:30:28.776 --> 01:30:31.138]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.538 --> 01:30:34.921]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:35.422]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.002 --> 01:30:39.906]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.146 --> 01:30:44.911]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:49.215]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:50.937]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:59.511 --> 01:32:00.511]  I had tried everything.
[01:32:00.572 --> 01:32:05.654]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:32:06.074 --> 01:32:10.556]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:32:10.896 --> 01:32:17.279]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:32:17.759 --> 01:32:28.243]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:28.964 --> 01:32:33.106]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:32:33.446 --> 01:32:36.447]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:32:36.807 --> 01:32:39.468]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:39.688 --> 01:32:40.849]  Now that's results.
[01:32:41.269 --> 01:32:47.692]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:32:48.052 --> 01:32:53.395]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:32:56.336 --> 01:32:57.937]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:33:16.348 --> 01:33:27.631]  Ladies and gentlemen, even though things have gotten incredibly corrupt, even though we see tyranny all around us, now it's becoming clearer to people.
[01:33:28.777 --> 01:33:32.100]  Now, folks that are in denial are easier to reach out to.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:38.386]  I mean, look, I just read you Time Magazine admitting a private banking coup over Europe and open private world government.
[01:33:38.786 --> 01:33:45.833]  You can type world government, global governance in to a search engine, click news, and get hundreds of articles per day.
[01:33:46.574 --> 01:33:47.234]  We've done it on air.
[01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:47.815]  We've shown you.
[01:33:49.136 --> 01:33:52.119]  When the G20 meets, sometimes there's thousands of articles.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.801]  Or when the Davos meets,
[01:33:54.673 --> 01:34:01.675]  And they're openly saying, oh, we just got an idea for the big megabanks to set up a corporate government, unaccountable, because we're the experts and we'll run things.
[01:34:03.076 --> 01:34:04.096]  Here's Time Magazine.
[01:34:05.137 --> 01:34:06.657]  Regime change in Europe.
[01:34:06.717 --> 01:34:08.618]  Greece and Italy amount to bankers' coup.
[01:34:10.158 --> 01:34:10.659]  You see that?
[01:34:11.819 --> 01:34:12.979]  And that's what's happening here.
[01:34:13.019 --> 01:34:14.240]  But it's totally illegitimate.
[01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:27.933]  I want to get into actual Bible verses, and even if you're not a Christian, folks, the point is, this country says it's 80% Christian, 100 plus million people go to church every week, they really do what their preachers tell them, instead of going to the Bible.
[01:34:28.433 --> 01:34:30.433]  You need to find a preacher that actually goes to the Bible.
[01:34:30.573 --> 01:34:32.594]  And that sounds simple, that's not what's happening.
[01:34:32.854 --> 01:34:37.975]  But even if you're not a Christian, understand that's what's governing this country to a great extent, is the churches neutralized.
[01:34:38.015 --> 01:34:43.716]  It was the churches that gave the moral support to fight the greatest empire the world had ever seen and defeat it.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.422]  Back then, the preachers across the denominations wore black.
[01:34:47.442 --> 01:34:50.044]  It was called the Black Brigades that led the war.
[01:34:50.324 --> 01:34:54.587]  Some of the first people to die were preachers at Lexington and Concord.
[01:34:55.127 --> 01:34:56.468]  They were leading the fights.
[01:34:56.548 --> 01:34:58.930]  They were handing out the muskets in the churches.
[01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:00.871]  They would keep the muskets in the churches.
[01:35:03.253 --> 01:35:04.074]  Now look at it.
[01:35:04.374 --> 01:35:07.156]  I mean, you talk about servile, demonic creatures.
[01:35:08.297 --> 01:35:12.980]  There have been a few national TV preachers that I've seen speak out against this evil.
[01:35:15.438 --> 01:35:18.180]  One of them was that preacher out of Florida that died a few years ago.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.522]  I remember I'd go over to my grandma's house, she'd have him on, he'd be talking about it.
[01:35:20.902 --> 01:35:25.545]  There's very few out there that are actually covering this.
[01:35:25.825 --> 01:35:30.749]  And now, I want to get into the Romans 13 book, which is so important, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:32.470]  Get it to every one of your preachers.
[01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:39.795]  It's a good test to see, because a lot of times they're not pushing the Clergy Response Team stuff publicly, they're waiting until the crisis happens.
[01:35:39.815 --> 01:35:40.636]  You need to identify.
[01:35:41.499 --> 01:35:47.705]  I mean, you'll see some of the messages about do what government says and don't talk about politics here and, you know, don't organize in this church.
[01:35:48.065 --> 01:35:49.046]  That's a telltale sign.
[01:35:49.426 --> 01:35:52.949]  Some of them are overtly admitting their clergy response teams are part of InfraGard.
[01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:57.233]  You need to give them this book and ask them, Pastor, read this and tell me what you think.
[01:35:57.253 --> 01:35:58.735]  A month later, did you read it?
[01:35:59.215 --> 01:35:59.916]  If not, why?
[01:36:01.776 --> 01:36:06.958]  And then I think you should find a different church if they won't even read the book and won't even tell you what they think.
[01:36:07.038 --> 01:36:13.120]  Or if they tell you they're for it, you should try to intervene with them and get past the fake authority of one of these preachers.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.341]  They only have authority when they're doing God's work.
[01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:21.463]  And if they sit there trying to brush you off, you say, listen, this isn't a game, okay?
[01:36:22.063 --> 01:36:26.724]  I mean, imagine, I grew up hearing about China where the preachers were spies and they had government-run churches.
[01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:28.365]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:36:29.369 --> 01:36:30.429]  So I want to get into it.
[01:36:30.809 --> 01:36:32.310]  And you can also call and get the book.
[01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:33.490]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:34.390]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:35.950]  It's $19.95.
[01:36:38.771 --> 01:36:40.071]  Very handsome book as well.
[01:36:40.811 --> 01:36:42.892]  And that's good to get people to read it.
[01:36:43.492 --> 01:36:48.293]  But I know that I had Dave Mustaine at my house this weekend, a Christian, and he happened to see it out of all these books laying around.
[01:36:48.313 --> 01:36:49.813]  And he's like, wow, what's this?
[01:36:49.833 --> 01:36:51.033]  I said, oh, have a copy.
[01:36:51.653 --> 01:36:53.034]  And I talked to him a few days ago.
[01:36:53.054 --> 01:36:54.414]  He's like, oh, that's an amazing book.
[01:36:55.134 --> 01:37:02.597]  So again, it really pops out at people, and when you purchase it, it supports Pastor Chuck Baldwin's work, and also our work here.
[01:37:02.997 --> 01:37:08.799]  And again, I think it really dovetails with Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:37:09.439 --> 01:37:12.741]  Great to give your pastors, but also city council, county commissioners, you name it.
[01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:17.482]  These are info war weapons that are, you know, short books, but very well written.
[01:37:17.882 --> 01:37:21.204]  I want to get more into the book here in a moment, but shifting gears into the wider area.
[01:37:22.423 --> 01:37:27.624]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate, constitutional expert, his son a constitutional lawyer, writing the book with him.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.882]  I have the headline, coup d'etat, Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial.
[01:37:32.922 --> 01:37:35.904]  I don't know, I didn't ask this for the interview, but it's been out for two days.
[01:37:35.924 --> 01:37:43.948]  I don't know if you've seen the video of Panetta, SecDef, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs saying, no, we don't come to Congress for war, we go to the UN for that authority.
[01:37:44.668 --> 01:37:46.229]  Okay, so you did see it.
[01:37:46.249 --> 01:37:53.232]  I want to get your take on that, and I've had constitutional lawyers on, I've had members of the military on, like Tony Schaefer.
[01:37:53.532 --> 01:37:56.094]  They say this is illegal, and it is treason.
[01:37:56.154 --> 01:37:56.734]  What do you say?
[01:37:56.754 --> 01:37:58.195]  I say ditto.
[01:37:59.618 --> 01:38:22.002]  Can you imagine, after reading George Washington's farewell address, when he very plainly and succinctly states in no uncertain terms that America should avoid at all costs foreign entanglements, that we should seek peace and free trade with all nations, but that we should never get involved in their political affairs.
[01:38:22.922 --> 01:38:25.243]  Can you imagine that sentiment?
[01:38:25.894 --> 01:38:41.386]  And then turning around and hearing what Mr. Panetta said, that Congress, the Congress of the United States, is not the agent by which America goes to war or not, but the United Nations or any other international organization that might apply.
[01:38:41.406 --> 01:38:51.214]  The egregiousness of this is so severe that it really does strain the imagination.
[01:38:51.694 --> 01:38:54.717]  I think what it does show is the boldness
[01:38:55.552 --> 01:39:02.282]  Of these globalists today, they assume that there's nothing that is going to be done to challenge them.
[01:39:02.322 --> 01:39:04.285]  They assume that they can get by with it.
[01:39:05.251 --> 01:39:09.873]  They assume that they are going to accrue this power under themselves and that no one is going to resist them.
[01:39:10.093 --> 01:39:10.933]  It's total hubris.
[01:39:10.973 --> 01:39:13.874]  In fact, everybody I've talked to, including you, says the same thing.
[01:39:14.135 --> 01:39:16.836]  The Senators said they had trouble, that they were actually catching their breath.
[01:39:16.856 --> 01:39:20.717]  They had adrenaline rushes because the treason was so open, the crime was so huge.
[01:39:21.057 --> 01:39:22.638]  I mean, the cornerstone being assaulted.
[01:39:22.758 --> 01:39:27.540]  Everyone I've talked to says the same thing, that it's staggering, that it's shocking.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.561]  Because for those of us that do know history,
[01:39:31.621 --> 01:39:43.825]  I mean, Congressman Jones has introduced the impeachment resolutions, you know, points out that the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's inclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[01:39:44.185 --> 01:39:47.846]  And he goes on to say it's a high crime and misdemeanor if the President took this power.
[01:39:47.926 --> 01:39:53.827]  But to say he does it under a foreign power is espionage.
[01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:58.829]  It'd be like helicopters landing with foreign troops and saying they've taken the Capitol over.
[01:39:58.889 --> 01:39:59.569]  I mean, it's just...
[01:40:00.409 --> 01:40:02.551]  It's incredible!
[01:40:03.653 --> 01:40:04.453]  Yeah, it is.
[01:40:04.634 --> 01:40:08.958]  And again, I think it's because they assume that they're going to be able to get by with it, and of course they're not.
[01:40:09.558 --> 01:40:20.149]  But going back to the Romans 13 book, I think this is why the Romans 13 book is so important, is because how many preachers are going to stand up in their pulpits when they hear disinformation?
[01:40:20.703 --> 01:40:27.689]  And they're going to say to their people, this is unconstitutional, this is immoral, this is un-American, and this is unbiblical!
[01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:36.437]  And then go into the scripture and highlight the principles from the Word of God to establish in the hearts and the minds of the people the reasons why.
[01:40:37.099 --> 01:40:37.759]  This is wrong.
[01:40:38.219 --> 01:40:43.280]  And why real Americans and real Christians cannot and must not submit to this.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.661]  This is what's missing.
[01:40:45.021 --> 01:40:45.901]  This is what's missing.
[01:40:46.301 --> 01:40:47.441]  This is what we had back in 1775.
[01:40:47.481 --> 01:40:53.403]  You mentioned it a minute ago, you referenced it.
[01:40:53.503 --> 01:40:58.464]  On April 19, 1775, when that shot was fired around the world, at Lexington Green.
[01:40:58.864 --> 01:40:59.924]  Well, who fired the shot?
[01:41:00.595 --> 01:41:09.019]  Well, the history books don't usually tell you this, but who fired the shot was Pastor Jonas Clark and his male congregants from the Church of Lexington.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:22.026]  They were the minute men that stood on Lexington Greed and fired on the Redcoats as they were marching towards Concord to confiscate the firearms and to arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock.
[01:41:22.717 --> 01:41:31.527]  It was Christian men and a Christian pastor that literally fired the shot, heard around the world, which started our war for independence.
[01:41:32.187 --> 01:41:37.894]  That's what's not being taught, and that's what's missing in our society today, is that courageous, bold,
[01:41:38.414 --> 01:41:48.423]  Black regiment pastor who stands in front of his flock and teaches them the principles of the Word of God with the courage and the conviction of his heart as to what those principles are.
[01:41:48.783 --> 01:42:00.193]  The people gather together and they hear these principles and they're motivated and inspired by these principles so that when tyranny comes, they can see it, they can identify it,
[01:42:00.533 --> 01:42:03.075]  They know what it is, and they know what to do about it.
[01:42:03.135 --> 01:42:14.104]  And that's why the system has tried to take over the churches in every case, because they know, and I'm not trying to get religious here, folks, but I'm being honest with you, they know that the Holy Spirit will direct you to resist tyranny.
[01:42:14.464 --> 01:42:19.468]  I mean, if you're really a Christian, folks, and have a relationship with God, you're not going to be able to control yourself to resist tyranny.
[01:42:19.688 --> 01:42:27.314]  These people that are scared to resist it and speak out against it, folks, if you've got God living in your heart, you can't control yourself to resist tyranny.
[01:42:28.004 --> 01:42:28.745]  Oh, amen to that.
[01:42:29.466 --> 01:42:33.172]  And that was what was so critical about the Revolutionary War period.
[01:42:33.532 --> 01:42:36.877]  And that's why they were called the Black Regiment.
[01:42:36.897 --> 01:42:39.280]  That was the moniker that was given by the Crown.
[01:42:40.337 --> 01:42:51.986]  Because what was going on was these preachers, all denominations, this cuts across every denomination, all the denominations of that period, were trumpeting forth these principles that we're talking about here.
[01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:57.750]  And it's so incensed that the British Crown, that they referred to them as the Black Regiment.
[01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:01.913]  They gave them that moniker because, number one, they went to the pulpit with the black robes.
[01:43:02.862 --> 01:43:04.264]  And that's where the black came from.
[01:43:04.584 --> 01:43:13.393]  And in the regiment, they referred to that military term because they were at the forefront of the independence movement and the liberty movement of that period.
[01:43:13.434 --> 01:43:15.456]  And so they referred to them as the black regiment.
[01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:19.120]  They were so influential in the minds and the hearts
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:29.725]  And thinking of the colonial Americans at that time, that they knew that it was those colonial pulpits that was actually behind our war for independence.
[01:43:29.805 --> 01:43:31.886]  Without them, there would have been no war for independence.
[01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:33.907]  That's what's missing today, Alex.
[01:43:34.287 --> 01:43:38.870]  And the reason it's missing, I think, is because of this erroneous fallacious interpretation of Romans 13.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.404]  They have just bought into this hook, line, and sinker, and it's made slaves of them.
[01:43:45.924 --> 01:43:51.088]  And until the Christians and I, while we want the pastors to get it, look, let's get this out to the Christians.
[01:43:51.368 --> 01:43:53.930]  Let's get this out to the church members, the people in the pews.
[01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:59.274]  And even those of the listeners right now that are not Christians, you all interact with Christians.
[01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:00.915]  You have friends that are Christians.
[01:44:00.935 --> 01:44:01.996]  You work with Christians.
[01:44:02.576 --> 01:44:03.896]  You're in Athletics with Christians.
[01:44:04.357 --> 01:44:16.020]  You need to get this book to familiarize yourself with the principles of the Scripture, so that you can talk to other Christians whenever the opportunity arises, and you can show them from the Scripture what is the true meaning of this issue.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.241]  If you believe in liberty, whether you're Christian or not, Romans Chapter 13 affects you.
[01:44:22.639 --> 01:44:25.323]  Let me pose this question to you, Pastor.
[01:44:25.603 --> 01:44:26.724]  Chuck Baldwin is our guest.
[01:44:27.285 --> 01:44:32.712]  How would you approach, let's say you've been going to a Baptist church, Methodist, Catholic, whatever it is,
[01:44:33.652 --> 01:44:35.993]  With all due respect, and I've been a pastor for over 35 years, so
[01:45:01.636 --> 01:45:04.317]  What I'm about to say, I say with all due respect.
[01:45:05.898 --> 01:45:29.506]  There's no way that a Christian who knows the Bible, a Christian who loves God and who loves freedom, could sit in a congregation and participate and give his tithes and offerings and support to a pastor in a congregation that would ask him to submit to tyranny, to confiscate his guns, etc.
[01:45:30.782 --> 01:45:31.362]  There's no way.
[01:45:32.563 --> 01:45:36.004]  There comes a point in time where you have to vote with your feet.
[01:45:37.365 --> 01:45:40.026]  I mean, I know that that's hard for some Christians.
[01:45:40.646 --> 01:45:49.150]  And, you know, you have friends at that church, and your family tradition may be in that church, and you love the history of that church, etc., etc.
[01:45:50.091 --> 01:45:59.655]  But there comes a time when if that pastor and that congregation are going to, of their own accord and of their own will,
[01:46:01.266 --> 01:46:09.332]  Take that congregation into tyranny and ask you or even demand of you that you participate in that servitude.
[01:46:10.012 --> 01:46:20.380]  There's no way that a real Christian could sit there and maintain membership there and maintain support there and continue to give their tithes and offerings there.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:30.227]  Look, if the people of America, if the churchmen of America would go to their pastors and say, I'm talking about across the board,
[01:46:31.201 --> 01:46:33.763]  We are not going to put up with this.
[01:46:33.943 --> 01:46:35.744]  We are not turning in our firearms.
[01:46:35.804 --> 01:46:37.345]  We are not going to be silenced.
[01:46:37.425 --> 01:46:44.691]  We are not going to allow these international tyrants to run over our country, our freedoms, our children's future, etc.
[01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:51.896]  And if you don't lead the charge for freedom and truth, then we are going to find a pastor that will.
[01:46:52.056 --> 01:46:59.501]  And by the way, I know that there are many, many people listening to you right now, Alex, that are desperate to find
[01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:01.991]  A patriot pastor.
[01:47:03.732 --> 01:47:13.236]  With your permission, I'd like to give my website, because we have about 500 pastors across America that have volunteered to be on our Black Regiment list.
[01:47:13.576 --> 01:47:14.817]  Oh good, I didn't even know about this.
[01:47:14.877 --> 01:47:16.117]  I want to find one here in Austin.
[01:47:16.437 --> 01:47:29.063]  Yeah, and go to my website, it's www.chuckbaldwinlive.com, all one word, chuckbaldwinlive.com, and there's a link that says Black Regiment.
[01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:33.091]  And you click on that and it comes up state by state.
[01:47:33.712 --> 01:47:39.762]  And you can go to your state and you can look through the list and if there is a black regiment pastor near where you live
[01:47:41.411 --> 01:47:46.732]  Now you have found a man that's willing to stand up for the truth and you can go to his church.
[01:47:46.752 --> 01:47:50.573]  I hope we don't crash your website because people are interested in that.
[01:47:51.413 --> 01:47:55.935]  I tell you, it's just fantastic what you're doing.
[01:47:56.935 --> 01:48:01.676]  I wanted to play a clip, but I'm going to have to do it when Bob Chapman's on with us, of the FBI director.
[01:48:02.856 --> 01:48:05.219]  And it's on Fox News, saying, you know what?
[01:48:05.419 --> 01:48:08.262]  I don't know if the President's allowed to kill Americans secretly in America.
[01:48:08.622 --> 01:48:09.503]  I gotta check with him.
[01:48:09.523 --> 01:48:13.947]  And of course, you know Congress gave Obama that power, but just, if they could give him the power to...
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:19.023]  To lay children on the White House lawn, you know, a law that's repugnant is still illegal.
[01:48:19.603 --> 01:48:21.905]  Marbury versus Madison, I mean, it's just common sense.
[01:48:21.925 --> 01:48:25.087]  There's God's law, common law, organic law, whatever you want to call it.
[01:48:25.427 --> 01:48:26.928]  You can pass whatever law you want.
[01:48:26.948 --> 01:48:32.212]  You can pass a law saying black people aren't humans, but as soon as they stand up and resist, we know who has the moral authority.
[01:48:33.112 --> 01:48:39.637]  And as the founder of the Texas Rangers said, nobody in the wrong can stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a-coming.
[01:48:40.177 --> 01:48:43.038]  And the key is when you just stop caring and say, I'm doing what's right.
[01:48:43.618 --> 01:48:44.558]  That's the end of it.
[01:48:44.798 --> 01:48:46.178]  I'm coming on against your evil.
[01:48:46.599 --> 01:48:47.799]  Evil can't stand against that.
[01:48:47.859 --> 01:48:51.700]  It can crush some of us individually, but they cannot kill ideas.
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:54.060]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:49:00.082]  But to look at the NDAA, to look at Obama saying last year, I don't need Congress.
[01:49:00.202 --> 01:49:00.602]  I have the UN.
[01:49:01.762 --> 01:49:03.023]  And the Congress just sat there.
[01:49:03.364 --> 01:49:11.090]  Well, the next step is going to be Obama marching in his thugs to literally look at the Senators and say, no, you don't, you're not involved in war making.
[01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:13.632]  When the Constitution says that's the law.
[01:49:14.153 --> 01:49:16.195]  I mean, this is beyond treason.
[01:49:16.555 --> 01:49:18.296]  Pastor, what is it when it's beyond treason?
[01:49:18.316 --> 01:49:19.818]  We can ask your son constitutional lawyer.
[01:49:19.838 --> 01:49:20.318]  I've asked him.
[01:49:20.698 --> 01:49:25.582]  I mean, it is sedition when you're working for a foreign power to overthrow the existing government.
[01:49:26.303 --> 01:49:27.804]  through a national security state.
[01:49:28.364 --> 01:49:31.947]  That is a foreign coup d'etat through traitor operatives.
[01:49:32.387 --> 01:49:38.131]  But it's not a government, it's a global corporate system, the New World Order.
[01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.652]  I mean, what do we do about this?
[01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:42.194]  I mean, I've gone on air and called for their arrest.
[01:49:42.234 --> 01:49:43.254]  I've called for their impeachment.
[01:49:43.755 --> 01:49:48.138]  Within an hour, we learned it had already begun, but they're only saying if he doesn't come now and
[01:49:48.638 --> 01:49:52.079]  You know, admit he has to get approval, then the impeachment proceeding begins.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.180]  What about Libya?
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.380]  We need impeachment now!
[01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:57.122]  We need to... I mean, this is outrageous!
[01:49:57.202 --> 01:49:58.322]  Impeachment is not enough!
[01:50:00.103 --> 01:50:17.730]  Yeah, I hear you, Alex, and this is why I think it's important that, and this is a whole other topic, but I just think it's incredibly important that we start recognizing the importance of the states, the power and authority that is God-given to the states.
[01:50:18.817 --> 01:50:26.942]  Each state is a nation-state with its own natural law, rights, and authority that's been granted to us by God.
[01:50:27.623 --> 01:50:32.786]  And whenever we became a nation and the Constitution was ratified, drafted in 1787 and 1789,
[01:50:35.433 --> 01:50:37.154]  We did not abandon state governments.
[01:50:37.354 --> 01:50:39.115]  We did not become a national government.
[01:50:39.135 --> 01:50:39.736]  Stay there.
[01:50:39.756 --> 01:50:40.456]  Stay there.
[01:50:40.516 --> 01:50:40.976]  Exactly.
[01:50:41.057 --> 01:50:49.742]  Now that the Feds have killed the state governments that are still there but dormant and are waking up, now the Feds are being told, the Congress is being told, you don't count either.
[01:50:50.102 --> 01:50:50.983]  It's the UN.
[01:50:51.103 --> 01:50:51.683]  It's NATO.
[01:50:51.723 --> 01:50:52.984]  I mean, that's what they're saying.
[01:50:53.224 --> 01:50:58.868]  We're going to come back with nullification, states' rights, and a Pentagon plan to crush the states straight ahead.
[01:50:59.728 --> 01:51:01.290]  So you're a maker of something.
[01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:06.997]  Woodcrafts, fishing lures, glass designs, jewelry, purses, perfumes, goat's milk soap.
[01:51:07.377 --> 01:51:10.781]  Whatever it is, you made it here in America.

[01:52:38.554 --> 01:52:40.756]  With MDS Forte, there are none.

[01:54:13.039 --> 01:54:15.505]  We haven't absolutely completely jam-packed.
[01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:20.964]  Third hour today, Bob Chapman on the economy, on the police state.
[01:54:21.004 --> 01:54:26.569]  I'm going to premiere a little three-minute promo of the Dave Mustaine interview.
[01:54:27.149 --> 01:54:30.232]  One of the founders of Metallica, Megadeth, you know, rock royalty.
[01:54:30.873 --> 01:54:34.396]  Came, you know, to Austin, been friends with him for years, but spent time at my home.
[01:54:34.416 --> 01:54:37.339]  Just such a great Christian, really strengthened my faith.
[01:54:37.479 --> 01:54:42.623]  And I'm not trying to make this religious, but as the world gets worse and worse, I've never hidden my faith.
[01:54:42.663 --> 01:54:43.925]  But let me tell you, it's the answer.
[01:54:44.525 --> 01:54:45.887]  This is pure evil we're fighting.
[01:54:46.267 --> 01:54:47.709]  That's why they're trying to take over the churches.
[01:54:47.749 --> 01:54:53.816]  But that Dave Mustaine is going to premiere next hour with some of the zingers of the big hour and a half interview we're going to premiere next week.
[01:54:55.198 --> 01:54:56.419]  And I've also got to get into...
[01:54:58.396 --> 01:55:01.157]  Some other videos we're going to air that are just off the charts amazing.
[01:55:01.177 --> 01:55:14.764]  Going back to Pastor Chuck Baldwin, the book is Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission, 2nd edition, Timothy Baldwin, constitutional lawyer and his father, Chuck Baldwin, both great men, great minds, and also Behind the Green Mask, UNIGINE 21.
[01:55:15.365 --> 01:55:17.386]  Both these I'm promoting because they're key.
[01:55:18.306 --> 01:55:25.291]  Info weapons to really unlock minds to understand real threats and they tie together both available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:25.691 --> 01:55:35.018]  Now going back to Pastor Chuck Baldwin, I know you've probably got to go if you want to stay five minutes to the next hour you can and we'll then go to Bob Chapman after that but if you got to go here in three minutes I understand.
[01:55:35.038 --> 01:55:43.464]  I should have asked you during the break but getting into state nullification I've confirmed under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act I've confirmed from military sources that
[01:55:43.804 --> 01:55:47.667]  The Feds are preparing to militarily try to invade the states.
[01:55:47.687 --> 01:55:49.529]  Remember last year when they said no to TSA?
[01:55:49.869 --> 01:55:53.933]  The Feds said, we'll run a combat blockade of your airwaves with F-16s.
[01:55:54.033 --> 01:55:59.957]  I mean, it just shows how the federal government has been captured by foreign criminals.
[01:56:01.659 --> 01:56:02.700]  But it is the solution.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.521]  That's why they're so scared of it, Pastor.
[01:56:05.402 --> 01:56:06.303]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:56:07.424 --> 01:56:11.327]  The Federalist Papers, even Alexander Hamilton was very clear
[01:56:12.153 --> 01:56:23.423]  That they anticipated that it would be the states that would jealously guard the liberties and freedoms of the citizens within the states against the overreach of the federal government.
[01:56:24.584 --> 01:56:30.189]  This is something that, historically true, goes all the way back to the foundation of our country and the formation of our Constitution.
[01:56:30.730 --> 01:56:35.193]  And I think now there are some states that are beginning to awaken and to
[01:56:36.247 --> 01:56:37.208]  I think it's a good idea.
[01:57:00.482 --> 01:57:12.253]  And they are not, they just flat will not participate in some kind of a coup against the Constitution and the American people if that was suggested or required.
[01:57:12.273 --> 01:57:20.701]  Do you agree with me that the coup with these announcements of NDAA and telling Congress they have no authority over war, is the coup not taking place publicly right now?
[01:57:21.081 --> 01:57:21.501]  Sure it is.
[01:57:22.221 --> 01:57:22.922]  It always does.
[01:57:22.942 --> 01:57:23.562]  It always has.
[01:57:23.582 --> 01:57:25.543]  I mean, that's what it was, that's what was done in Germany.
[01:57:25.563 --> 01:57:26.643]  That's what was done in China.
[01:57:27.583 --> 01:57:33.206]  It's always done probably first because you have to prepare the minds and the hearts of people for what is coming.
[01:57:33.786 --> 01:57:35.586]  You can't just surprise them with it.
[01:57:36.287 --> 01:57:37.827]  They would react negatively.
[01:57:38.127 --> 01:57:42.049]  So you have to prepare them emotionally and psychologically and mentally, etc.
[01:57:42.369 --> 01:57:43.649]  So that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:50.372]  They're in that stage right now where they're trying to prepare the hearts and the minds of people for what they have in store for us.
[01:57:50.572 --> 01:57:56.017]  And that's why we've got to fight as hard as we can to answer it and say no, no!
[01:57:56.618 --> 01:57:58.940]  That's why your show is so important.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:07.049]  That's why all these folks around the country that are standing up for freedom and liberty and the constitutional government, that's why their voices are so important.
[01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:12.134]  And that's why it's critically important that we get the information that you're talking about into the hands
[01:58:12.694 --> 01:58:13.214]  Amen to that.
[01:58:13.294 --> 01:58:14.895]  I tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:15.055 --> 01:58:20.136]  Back in one minute, five more minutes with Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:58:20.296 --> 01:58:21.496]  We'll be right back.

[01:58:49.457 --> 01:58:50.718]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:50.758 --> 01:58:56.122]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:56.342 --> 01:59:00.986]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:01.366 --> 01:59:06.450]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:11.634]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:12.154 --> 01:59:12.995]  We're good to go.

[02:00:08.979 --> 02:00:09.799]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.559 --> 02:00:11.520]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:20.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:23.991]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin is our guest.
[02:00:24.011 --> 02:00:27.633]  I want to get him to join us in the near future and with video Skype and Other Dimension.
[02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:35.898]  I know we're going out on XM Channel 166 over 100 AM and FM stations and number one in audio streams and podcasts for a political talk show at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:38.186 --> 02:00:41.107]  Thanks to all you spreading the word and our tireless efforts here in the crew.
[02:00:41.127 --> 02:00:45.088]  But I do look forward to getting him on video Skype so folks can actually see him.
[02:00:45.348 --> 02:00:47.549]  We're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:47.569 --> 02:00:50.370]  We got about five minutes in this segment and Bob Chapman's coming up.
[02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:56.172]  And exclusive excerpts of the Dave Mustaine interview and a big breakdown of a bunch of news.
[02:00:56.232 --> 02:01:01.194]  I'm going to expose this new Kony 2012 thing about invading Africa.
[02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:03.015]  That's all the U.N.
[02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:05.938]  and others behind that, so we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[02:01:06.458 --> 02:01:17.048]  Finishing up, Pastor, in the time we have, with the states' rights movement, the system is attacking that because, as you said, they know that's one of the keys that the founders gave us to reverse this.
[02:01:17.088 --> 02:01:22.973]  But I also just want to point out, now the U.N., through the President, is saying, Congress, you don't count!
[02:01:23.273 --> 02:01:28.018]  First they nullify the states, now they're nullifying the federal government, now it's totally clear!
[02:01:29.439 --> 02:01:32.982]  Not only are the states in trouble, the federal government's being taken over, sir.
[02:01:33.002 --> 02:01:41.789]  I think the goal all along was to bring an international element to the governance of our country.
[02:01:41.829 --> 02:01:53.299]  They see America as the big prize, the big apple that's got to fall from the tree in order to merge together this new world order, this global society,
[02:01:54.845 --> 02:01:56.385]  Of course, it's all generated by money.
[02:01:56.405 --> 02:02:07.947]  It's generated by international bankers and international corporations who really are encumbered with all of these national rules and regulations governing commerce.
[02:02:08.367 --> 02:02:17.249]  And what they want to do is they want to break down those barriers so that they can interact internationally as they would interact nationally.
[02:02:18.029 --> 02:02:20.530]  And that's been the goal, I think, all along.
[02:02:20.590 --> 02:02:22.890]  And you've trumpeted that for many years.
[02:02:23.590 --> 02:02:24.991]  As many of us have.
[02:02:25.152 --> 02:02:28.275]  And so I think what we're seeing here is the second step.
[02:02:29.095 --> 02:02:36.122]  As you said, first let's nullify the states instead of the states nullifying unlawful government from the federal government.
[02:02:36.503 --> 02:02:44.851]  Let's nullify the states and now let's nullify Congress so that we can bring about this globalist union that we want to create.
[02:02:44.951 --> 02:02:46.272]  And that's been the goal all along.
[02:02:46.372 --> 02:02:47.894]  I think it's just been a matter of steps.
[02:02:50.168 --> 02:02:53.752]  Well, our job's easier than ever because we warn people about the New World Order.
[02:02:53.772 --> 02:02:54.533]  Ron Paul did.
[02:02:54.593 --> 02:02:54.913]  You did.
[02:02:54.953 --> 02:02:58.777]  Countless others did for so long, we got laughed at and made fun of because we were informed.
[02:02:59.258 --> 02:03:01.620]  Now everybody's like, wow, everything you said's coming true.
[02:03:02.121 --> 02:03:06.586]  So I don't think they counted on us being there for the last, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, some people.
[02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:14.891]  In the case of G. Edward Griffin, or people like Bob Chapman, or Red Beckman, and I think that's our real ace in the hole, and as you said, Providence.
[02:03:15.511 --> 02:03:21.415]  History's shown that, that when good people take action, Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards justice.
[02:03:23.416 --> 02:03:27.939]  I truly believe that God is the author of freedom, not government.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:28.720]  God.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:33.002]  God is the founder of freedom.
[02:03:33.503 --> 02:03:35.204]  He is the promoter of freedom.
[02:03:36.230 --> 02:03:41.614]  His children have always been involved in the freedom fight in one way or the other.
[02:03:41.674 --> 02:04:00.927]  He has inspired men from Moses all the way through the Judges, the Old Testament Prophets, the New Testament Apostles, who stood up and fought for liberty and the principles of freedom that were established by God, our Creator, who gives us a free will to choose Him as our Savior and who wants us to serve Him by our will and by our choice.
[02:04:01.891 --> 02:04:03.813]  And so God is the promoter of freedom.
[02:04:03.853 --> 02:04:05.035]  He's the defender of freedom.
[02:04:05.476 --> 02:04:15.670]  And when men and women stand up courageously, indefatigably, for the principles of freedom, I believe with all my heart that God will fight with us.
[02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:18.454]  He did it for our forefathers, and I believe He'll do it for us.
[02:04:19.392 --> 02:04:35.944]  But we've got to, I've seen it in my own life, when I go through a fear, through a concern, I can feel these developmental thresholds, that when I just say, you know what, I'm giving it to you God, but then take action on faith, that's when the power kicks in, and I've seen it Pastor, I know it's real.
[02:04:36.124 --> 02:04:36.745]  Yep, me too.
[02:04:39.042 --> 02:04:48.105]  I agree with you, and I think you're doing a great job, and I hope your listeners will get that book, Romans 13, and get it in the hands of as many of their friends as they can.
[02:04:48.165 --> 02:04:51.245]  And believe me, when they read that book, the light will come on.
[02:04:51.846 --> 02:04:54.306]  Give it to your pastor today, a key weapon in the Infowar.
[02:04:54.526 --> 02:04:55.126]  Thank you, Pastor.
[02:04:55.146 --> 02:04:56.127]  We'll be back with Bob Chapman.
[02:04:56.487 --> 02:04:56.947]  Thanks, Alex.

[02:06:56.915 --> 02:06:57.776]  Others don't.
[02:06:59.016 --> 02:07:05.999]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:07:06.239 --> 02:07:23.848]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:07:24.128 --> 02:07:28.230]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:29.611]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[02:07:29.651 --> 02:07:32.193]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:08:00.932 --> 02:08:06.958]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:07.559 --> 02:08:10.542]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.791 --> 02:08:25.292]  It is Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:25.392 --> 02:08:28.652]  It is, of course, the ninth day of March 2012.
[02:08:30.033 --> 02:08:46.236]  And coming up next Thursday, we will air a close to hour and a half in-depth interview with one of the founders of Metallica, of course, the founder of Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, who was here in Austin with us for three days after his concert Saturday night.
[02:08:47.746 --> 02:08:50.768]  Turing with Motorhead the tour ended here and it's an in-depth interview.
[02:08:50.808 --> 02:08:58.633]  He said he said things in this he's never said before about Metallica About politics about you name it.
[02:08:58.873 --> 02:09:16.725]  It's it's a big interview and You know Dave wasn't come out here three or four months ago But I'd already booked a trip with my children down to the beach for a couple days and then he was gonna come a few months ago and he had and have neck surgery so didn't come and then he did come to town and just end his tour here in Austin and
[02:09:17.245 --> 02:09:18.306]  And it's a powerful interview.
[02:09:18.846 --> 02:09:20.987]  Powerful on a whole host of subjects.
[02:09:21.327 --> 02:09:27.329]  We've got a little three-minute promo we're going to air coming up at the bottom of the hour and then continuing with Bob Chapman.
[02:09:27.710 --> 02:09:29.510]  I'm going to get to powerful video.
[02:09:29.610 --> 02:09:36.153]  I mean, I've got to say Shepard Smith on Fox is one of the few good people on there other than Judge Napolitano.
[02:09:36.433 --> 02:09:44.137]  I mean, I agree with his politics, but he gets mad about predator drones to kill Americans and the FBI director saying, yeah, we may kill citizens in the U.S.
[02:09:44.157 --> 02:09:44.757]  just secretly.
[02:09:45.339 --> 02:09:46.419]  Just, you know, you disappear.
[02:09:46.599 --> 02:09:49.860]  That's always the greatest threat in history, is governments start doing that.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:57.082]  But they're like, we're going to keep you safe from some terrorists that we run in the Middle East, but we're going to secretly arrest you.
[02:09:57.102 --> 02:09:58.363]  And the UN runs things now.
[02:09:59.383 --> 02:10:02.764]  So that's a clip we're going to play and get Bob Chapman's take on as well.
[02:10:03.844 --> 02:10:05.444]  I've been trying to take more calls lately.
[02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:10.766]  I took a lot of calls yesterday, but so much is happening, my head is starting to spin.
[02:10:11.126 --> 02:10:13.907]  We've got an NSA whistleblower who says Obama worse than Bush.
[02:10:15.247 --> 02:10:16.489]  More spying without warrants.
[02:10:16.509 --> 02:10:21.753]  Well, yeah, courts are ruling the police can pull you over and grab your phone and download the contents without warrants.
[02:10:22.514 --> 02:10:23.995]  Phone numbers, contacts, everything.
[02:10:24.795 --> 02:10:25.376]  Photographs.
[02:10:25.436 --> 02:10:27.137]  I mean, it's just lawlessness.
[02:10:27.878 --> 02:10:31.181]  We've got a case of tyranny and it's spreading fast.
[02:10:31.221 --> 02:10:32.081]  It's like gangrene.
[02:10:32.162 --> 02:10:34.023]  We better get this taken care of.
[02:10:34.964 --> 02:10:35.885]  Pronto!
[02:10:37.173 --> 02:10:45.521]  I mean, un-delay, un-delay, un-delay, arriba, arriba, as Speedy Gonzales says, we need to deal with this right now.
[02:10:46.603 --> 02:10:49.405]  Okay, I mean, I'm literally like Speedy Gonzales just running around waving my arms here.
[02:10:49.706 --> 02:10:51.768]  I mean, this needs to be done yesterday.
[02:10:52.901 --> 02:10:55.143]  I mean, I'm sitting there having a... My wife's smart.
[02:10:55.183 --> 02:10:56.124]  She's lived all over the world.
[02:10:56.565 --> 02:10:58.006]  And she's like, I know we're fighting.
[02:10:58.026 --> 02:10:59.588]  We can do it from outside the U.S.
[02:10:59.888 --> 02:11:00.950]  We need to get out of here.
[02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:07.977]  I mean, I'm having to put my foot down and go, I understand that, but it's getting to the point where I may have to get her out of the country.
[02:11:08.478 --> 02:11:11.020]  And I mean, listen, I'm not concerned.
[02:11:11.941 --> 02:11:12.942]  If this continues,
[02:11:13.979 --> 02:11:15.459]  I'm gonna have to get my wife out of the country.
[02:11:15.539 --> 02:11:16.800]  I mean, this isn't a game.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.720]  This is not a joke.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:20.380]  This is not a drill.
[02:11:21.181 --> 02:11:27.922]  They don't try to say foreign groups run the country to the Congress because they're not planning to do that.
[02:11:28.762 --> 02:11:36.544]  They don't have NLE09 three years ago and say 15 countries' militaries are trying to take on domestic extremists and terrorists.
[02:11:36.964 --> 02:11:41.545]  They don't sign agreements to use Mexican and Canadian troops here in the US
[02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:45.877]  Because they want to play patty cake with us.
[02:11:46.238 --> 02:11:51.922]  They don't say we're going to secretly arrest citizens and disappear into black holes for no reason, just as Pastor Baldwin just said.
[02:11:52.202 --> 02:11:57.145]  They do it so that they can sell everybody and test everybody.
[02:11:58.326 --> 02:11:59.427]  Folks, they're going to take everything.
[02:11:59.467 --> 02:12:01.268]  It's going to be a total collapse the way this is going.
[02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:06.032]  Now, if they decide they can't execute this police state, they'll back off and not bring in a depression.
[02:12:07.493 --> 02:12:09.314]  It's on record they're engineering all this.
[02:12:10.195 --> 02:12:11.796]  You think the economy's bad now?
[02:12:11.856 --> 02:12:12.777]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:12:13.567 --> 02:12:15.168]  With liberty comes prosperity.
[02:12:15.228 --> 02:12:17.110]  With tyranny comes poverty.
[02:12:18.751 --> 02:12:20.332]  I mean, it's very simple equations.
[02:12:22.073 --> 02:12:23.314]  Now, I want to explain something here.
[02:12:24.855 --> 02:12:28.538]  This is beyond Caesar crossing the Rubicon and overthrowing the Roman Republic.
[02:12:28.618 --> 02:12:37.724]  Obama didn't say he can launch wars and kill whoever he wants because he's the President, which is treason and violates Article 1, Section 8, Clause 12.
[02:12:38.665 --> 02:12:40.546]  And there's impeachment stuff introduced on this now.
[02:12:40.746 --> 02:12:41.287]  This is big!
[02:12:42.662 --> 02:12:45.563]  And if he gets away with this, they're going to use it.
[02:12:46.704 --> 02:12:47.344]  He went further.
[02:12:47.384 --> 02:12:50.106]  He said, I do this under foreign power, in a letter.
[02:12:50.626 --> 02:12:52.387]  And that's what the SecDef and others said.
[02:12:53.007 --> 02:12:55.848]  They decided to go with the person that put them in.
[02:12:56.949 --> 02:12:59.370]  Well, Congress commissioned those officers, but decades ago.
[02:12:59.910 --> 02:13:02.852]  There's a reason, because you don't let the president pick his own guys or he'll take over.
[02:13:03.512 --> 02:13:04.152]  Duh!
[02:13:05.013 --> 02:13:05.733]  Duh!
[02:13:08.554 --> 02:13:09.175]  No-brainer!
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:19.267]  And so, I talk to these cops and people, especially the militarized ones and the SWAT team guys, and they act like robots, and they act like you're not a person, and they're like, that'll never happen.
[02:13:19.327 --> 02:13:20.248]  Well, we know best.
[02:13:20.488 --> 02:13:22.430]  Well, we won't abuse that authority.
[02:13:22.450 --> 02:13:23.891]  We won't abuse that authority.
[02:13:23.911 --> 02:13:25.972]  They're going to take all your pension funds, dummy.
[02:13:27.076 --> 02:13:28.757]  They're going to ruin your future as well.
[02:13:29.437 --> 02:13:33.218]  Look, America is the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[02:13:33.458 --> 02:13:39.020]  And when you start putting it down and acting like it's stupid, well, then you're putting down America.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.801]  I don't know how else to explain it to you.
[02:13:42.441 --> 02:13:45.102]  I know a lot of police and military are waking up, especially the military.
[02:13:45.242 --> 02:13:46.863]  And look, Ron Paul has been defrauded.
[02:13:46.883 --> 02:13:47.863]  I told everybody it was going to happen.
[02:13:48.143 --> 02:13:49.384]  They said, well, why did you support him then?
[02:13:51.226 --> 02:13:52.427]  Why did you support Ron Paul?
[02:13:53.107 --> 02:13:55.569]  Because he educated people, and he showed the election fraud.
[02:13:56.090 --> 02:13:57.671]  But everybody's like, wow, you're right again.
[02:13:57.711 --> 02:13:58.391]  How did you know?
[02:13:58.411 --> 02:14:05.537]  In fact, there's tape that's been released that I think's real that was recorded at an Obama event when he thought the mic was off.
[02:14:06.798 --> 02:14:08.279]  In fact, ask Rob Deu for that.
[02:14:08.299 --> 02:14:09.860]  We'll play it later and get Bob's take on it.
[02:14:11.361 --> 02:14:12.903]  And he's saying, yeah, no, Rick's out.
[02:14:12.943 --> 02:14:13.843]  It's going to be Mitt Romney.
[02:14:13.863 --> 02:14:15.444]  And you know what they did to Ron Paul in Maine.
[02:14:15.765 --> 02:14:16.425]  I don't blame them.
[02:14:16.565 --> 02:14:17.146]  And let me tell you.
[02:14:18.490 --> 02:14:26.394]  When that Kali Intik, a famous comedian, called my house and posed as Bush, and everybody thought it was real, I didn't even put it on the web.
[02:14:28.575 --> 02:14:34.838]  ManCow ended up doing it to see if folks bought it, and I said, I think it's a comedian, it's not George Bush.
[02:14:35.198 --> 02:14:35.659]  I can tell.
[02:14:36.059 --> 02:14:41.301]  This, if this isn't Obama, it's some computer that's recorded him and put it back together again.
[02:14:41.782 --> 02:14:44.383]  I mean, it's Obama.
[02:14:44.583 --> 02:14:46.224]  Or it's his twin brother.
[02:14:47.393 --> 02:14:49.913]  Because, I mean, it sounds, it's Obama.
[02:14:49.933 --> 02:14:51.594]  I mean, my gut, my brain says that's Obama.
[02:14:51.614 --> 02:14:55.554]  It may be fake, but then it's some computer splice of Obama.
[02:14:57.595 --> 02:15:00.835]  And my point is, is that this is real.
[02:15:01.936 --> 02:15:05.396]  I mean, we're being conquered by foreign megabanks, and that's what Time Magazine says.
[02:15:06.056 --> 02:15:08.437]  But it's like, oh, isn't it good the banks are going to run everything now?
[02:15:08.997 --> 02:15:15.478]  Now, Bob Chapman, almost 50 years fighting this, wrote the biggest newsletter for a while until he retired, came back.
[02:15:16.587 --> 02:15:18.192]  He joins us now to break this down.
[02:15:18.914 --> 02:15:21.100]  But obviously, Bob, the big news is coup d'etat.
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:23.206]  Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial.
[02:15:24.441 --> 02:15:28.764]  Uh, they're now going back on their thing and saying, well, we do have the power to kill citizens, foreign and domestic.
[02:15:28.804 --> 02:15:29.805]  We'll go ahead and do that.
[02:15:30.565 --> 02:15:40.612]  So, I mean, they're really trying to push torture, secret arrest, all the stuff we know that is the bad guys and saying it's to fight Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda publicly works for them.
[02:15:41.252 --> 02:15:52.020]  Uh, Bob Chapman, what is your view on, uh, the public statements to Congress that, uh, they can hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more.
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.161]  What do you make of this gauntlet being thrown down?
[02:15:56.302 --> 02:16:03.825]  Well, if you go back to the 1960s and 70s, you'll find that we contemplated these kinds of things.
[02:16:04.565 --> 02:16:15.869]  But we thought that because we had an elected Congress and a President, particularly Congress, that we would get some cooperation and some help.
[02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:17.590]  And we did!
[02:16:18.650 --> 02:16:21.632]  And then as things moved into the 90s and beyond,
[02:16:23.323 --> 02:16:35.568]  We started to get less and less and that's really where we're at today and what they're saying now is Congress is ceremonial and as is the U.S.
[02:16:35.588 --> 02:16:39.150]  government for that matter and the U.N.
[02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:50.475]  runs everything and we take our orders for them and it's in your face again and the question is how do you stop them?
[02:16:52.915 --> 02:16:53.815]  Well, you're right, Bob.
[02:16:54.115 --> 02:16:56.736]  And, of course, Caesar made the Senate ceremonial.
[02:16:57.056 --> 02:17:02.937]  But, I mean, they're there telling them, no, you don't launch war, you don't do anything, you don't have the... nothing.
[02:17:03.738 --> 02:17:04.758]  But they went further.
[02:17:04.778 --> 02:17:09.159]  They said, the UN gives us the orders, which is what the Supreme Court justices have now been saying.
[02:17:09.479 --> 02:17:11.280]  I mean, they're doing this on purpose.
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:12.640]  They're just acclimating everyone.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:25.689]  Now, of course, as you know, Walter Jones and the House and others in the Senate have introduced, and here's the bill, we'll actually put it on screen for people, they've actually introduced to the 112th Congress, H.Con.Res.107.
[02:17:25.749 --> 02:17:32.034]  So it's House Concurrent Resolution 107 and it's got a Senate bill as well and it says it's a high crime.
[02:17:32.754 --> 02:17:37.036]  And that it's treason, and that Obama had better seek their approval in future operations.
[02:17:37.076 --> 02:17:40.717]  But what about Libya last year where he said he did it for the UN?
[02:17:40.957 --> 02:17:45.439]  I guess they just didn't like the public affront of them coming in and telling them they were ceremonial.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:48.340]  I think you're right.
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:56.303]  And I also think that they're moving toward much bigger things beyond that.
[02:17:57.824 --> 02:18:00.405]  If the UN has the power to tell us what to do,
[02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:03.354]  Are the government what to do?
[02:18:05.015 --> 02:18:16.364]  And they decide that all Americans who have vehicles under, let's say, more than 10 years old, they have to be junked and they have to buy new ones.
[02:18:16.644 --> 02:18:24.731]  Or everybody who has small arms in the United States has to give them to the government along with the ammunition.
[02:18:25.471 --> 02:18:26.492]  And on and on.
[02:18:26.552 --> 02:18:29.034]  And that's how they intend to
[02:18:31.244 --> 02:18:33.528]  Uh, override, uh, the U.S.
[02:18:33.568 --> 02:18:44.004]  Congress, uh, the Office of the Presidency and do exactly what they want because I think up until this point, uh, they've not been able to do it or find an easier way to do it.
[02:18:44.622 --> 02:18:46.443]  So here they are decreeing it.
[02:18:46.683 --> 02:18:50.244]  That's right, they're going, exactly, they're going right to tyranny now.
[02:18:50.784 --> 02:18:57.646]  Right to Agenda 21 and what you mentioned the UN has said in their UNIDIR documents that they want total civilian ban of guns.
[02:18:58.107 --> 02:19:03.929]  They've said all the things you're saying and look at how he uses the EPA to enforce UN edicts.
[02:19:04.229 --> 02:19:06.810]  We're already under UN control to a great extent.
[02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:13.932]  That's been borne out as well by the
[02:19:15.311 --> 02:19:40.926]  uh... having the rules from country to country about things the same such as content how they're spelled out whether they're in ounces and things like that particularly pertaining to food and they're working very diligently at that and have been for the last several years and so those are the kind of things they start with and then all of a sudden they say
[02:19:42.427 --> 02:19:48.609]  All cars have to be made like the Volkswagen, whatchamacallit.
[02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:49.930]  Stay there, you're absolutely right.
[02:19:50.410 --> 02:19:52.931]  The UN did the lightbulb ban.
[02:19:53.291 --> 02:19:56.012]  The smoking ban is a UN treaty all over the world.
[02:19:56.433 --> 02:19:57.753]  We just pass it locally.
[02:19:58.633 --> 02:19:58.914]  Wow.
[02:19:59.474 --> 02:20:02.175]  We all know the importance of having storable foods.
[02:20:02.575 --> 02:20:04.256]  But what about when the food runs out?
[02:20:04.636 --> 02:20:05.056]  What then?
[02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:09.552]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:22:52.578 --> 02:22:53.039]  2012 is finally here.
[02:23:00.407 --> 02:23:06.009]  And while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:10.711]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[02:23:10.971 --> 02:23:20.935]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns, or are receiving threatening letters or phone calls, call the Tax Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[02:23:20.955 --> 02:23:24.136]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent with over
[02:23:28.018 --> 02:23:28.398]  I think so.
[02:24:04.583 --> 02:24:09.366]  All the preparations are being made to shut the country down the last five, six years.
[02:24:09.406 --> 02:24:12.148]  Total continuity agenda between Bush and now Obama.
[02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:15.751]  Trying to block being able to get your money out even legally.
[02:24:17.192 --> 02:24:21.074]  Almost all the big money leaving the United States because they've already sucked it dry.
[02:24:21.135 --> 02:24:22.335]  They know what they're going to do.
[02:24:23.016 --> 02:24:25.718]  Bob Chapman left the United States because of persecution.
[02:24:27.555 --> 02:24:31.496]  The bushes are down in Paraguay, right on a key smuggling route with hundreds of thousands of acres.
[02:24:32.717 --> 02:24:36.818]  So they've done a great job, and they're just going to leave us behind with a giant paramilitary army.
[02:24:37.919 --> 02:24:42.440]  There's a new article at Infowars.com by Steve Watson, who's been on fire lately.
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:44.921]  Maryland cops to be trained on U.S.
[02:24:44.941 --> 02:24:48.162]  Constitution after illegally arresting protesters.
[02:24:48.682 --> 02:24:55.385]  Pro-life demonstrators, including teenage girls, were strip-searched, shackled by officers, who said they could rot in cells.
[02:24:56.457 --> 02:25:09.094]  State police in Maryland have been ordered to undergo training on the First and Fourth Amendments following an 08 incident during which 18 pro-life or protesters were arrested, shackled, and strip-searched, including underage girls.
[02:25:10.384 --> 02:25:13.705]  And we have links to all the mainstream news articles admitting it, but they think it's good, though.
[02:25:13.725 --> 02:25:14.905]  It's like, well, this is good.
[02:25:15.405 --> 02:25:23.587]  The incident occurred when members of the group Defend Live peacefully demonstrated on public property in Hartford County August 2008 as part of their Face the Truth campaign.
[02:25:24.127 --> 02:25:28.228]  Around a dozen state officers arrived on the scene and told the protesters they did not have a permit.
[02:25:29.068 --> 02:25:32.829]  Again, a permit's to block roads, folks, but they tricked the cops into thinking it's everything.
[02:25:33.988 --> 02:25:35.588]  They think, you know, you have to have a permit for a gun, too.
[02:25:35.989 --> 02:25:38.289]  And would be arrested unless they packed up and left.
[02:25:38.829 --> 02:25:46.772]  When asked what specific ordinance the demonstrators needed a permit to protest, one officer responded, I'm not giving it to you at five o'clock at night.
[02:25:46.932 --> 02:25:48.032]  I'm a state police officer.
[02:25:48.132 --> 02:25:48.672]  I know the law.
[02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:49.353]  That's it.
[02:25:49.993 --> 02:25:53.774]  And it was captured on film where this all happened.
[02:25:53.834 --> 02:25:55.054]  It's at Infowars.com.
[02:25:56.255 --> 02:25:58.415]  And it's just really creepy, man.
[02:25:58.535 --> 02:25:59.796]  I've had it happen in Austin where
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:01.520]  I'm videotaping something.
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:03.361]  A cop pulls up over and over again.
[02:26:03.381 --> 02:26:04.221]  It's happened to Mike Hanson.
[02:26:04.261 --> 02:26:05.782]  Gets out, walks over and says, turn your camera off.
[02:26:06.562 --> 02:26:07.323]  I think I'm gonna arrest you.
[02:26:07.343 --> 02:26:08.003]  It's a lawful order.
[02:26:08.023 --> 02:26:08.763]  And I go, no, it isn't.
[02:26:09.444 --> 02:26:11.364]  I'm not just some idiot that doesn't know my rights.
[02:26:11.404 --> 02:26:12.085]  I'm gonna sue you.
[02:26:12.505 --> 02:26:13.625]  Oh, what, you don't like cops?
[02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:15.686]  No, I like living in a free country.
[02:26:16.186 --> 02:26:17.107]  I'm not, okay?
[02:26:17.787 --> 02:26:22.109]  And I've been filming police at a checkpoint 200 yards away, knowing they'd come over.
[02:26:22.129 --> 02:26:22.449]  And I'm like,
[02:26:23.129 --> 02:26:24.150]  You're interfering with us.
[02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.670]  No, I'm not.
[02:26:24.690 --> 02:26:25.591]  I'm 200 yards away.
[02:26:25.751 --> 02:26:26.551]  I'm going to arrest you.
[02:26:26.851 --> 02:26:27.292]  Go ahead.
[02:26:27.372 --> 02:26:27.612]  Next.
[02:26:27.932 --> 02:26:29.653]  Oh, what are the Serbs going to invade?
[02:26:29.673 --> 02:26:30.433]  That's on video.
[02:26:30.794 --> 02:26:32.335]  At a highway checkpoint, and they shut down on 35.
[02:26:32.435 --> 02:26:34.496]  And I go, no, you're invading.
[02:26:35.336 --> 02:26:36.897]  What is this, a federal grant to do this?
[02:26:37.298 --> 02:26:38.218]  How do you know that?
[02:26:38.238 --> 02:26:41.000]  Because I know how they're trying to destroy America, officer.
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:42.501]  I've got the data.
[02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:44.722]  I want you to live in a free country, too.
[02:26:45.002 --> 02:26:45.382]  So stop.
[02:26:45.842 --> 02:26:47.582]  First it's intimidation, then it's laughing at me.
[02:26:47.763 --> 02:26:49.063]  Why don't you just be an American?
[02:26:49.323 --> 02:26:55.385]  I know a bunch of crooks run the government, but can't you be smart enough to not be mad at some pro-lifers?
[02:26:56.645 --> 02:26:57.046]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:57.406 --> 02:27:01.267]  I'm ranting, Bob Chapman, but there are some good signs happening.
[02:27:01.527 --> 02:27:04.848]  The TSA had a video blocked exposing them.
[02:27:05.088 --> 02:27:08.189]  There was outcry and the video got put back up yesterday.
[02:27:08.249 --> 02:27:10.690]  So we are seeing victories, Bob Chapman.
[02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.790]  Yes, we are.
[02:27:12.810 --> 02:27:19.911]  And when you see those kinds of things happen to people when they're dragged out to jail, going to jail is one thing.
[02:27:20.852 --> 02:27:21.972]  It's certainly intimidating.
[02:27:21.992 --> 02:27:23.572]  I know, I've been there.
[02:27:25.912 --> 02:27:33.314]  But what is worse is the mental turmoil and the scars that you're putting on the people.
[02:27:34.054 --> 02:27:35.834]  It's pure terrorism.
[02:27:36.774 --> 02:27:37.795]  There's no better word for it.
[02:27:38.695 --> 02:27:40.435]  And they're trying to terrorize the public
[02:27:41.107 --> 02:27:51.054]  Into allowing them, law enforcement, military, whatever, to tell you what to do, how to do it, whether you like it or not, whether it's the law or not.
[02:27:51.594 --> 02:27:54.876]  And if you argue, down to the dungeon and you're naked.
[02:27:56.037 --> 02:28:02.201]  And this is the kind of tactics that they're taught in order to make people submissive.
[02:28:04.417 --> 02:28:06.397]  And they beta tested it all on pro-lifers.
[02:28:06.437 --> 02:28:15.879]  I've got the film in my martial law documentary where they would break pro-lifers' arms for just sitting on the sidewalk and call it pain compliance.
[02:28:16.079 --> 02:28:17.919]  Hardcore, life-threatening torture.
[02:28:18.479 --> 02:28:21.060]  But it's not torture because they call it pain compliance, Bob.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:33.782]  It reminds me of the Federal Reserve saying we're going to have a currency swap with the European Central Bank when in fact it's a loan and it's illegal from both ends.
[02:28:34.682 --> 02:28:41.674]  It's the same nomenclature, the changing of terms, the pseudo-intellectuality of it all.
[02:28:43.407 --> 02:28:48.790]  Well, that's like the state police called like five different people the day before we went down to cover him.
[02:28:48.810 --> 02:28:51.532]  They must have our phones tapped or something with these gunboats they've got.
[02:28:52.052 --> 02:28:57.195]  And I kept talking to different members and they kept, the state police kept calling going, Alex Jones isn't on the air on the station, is he?
[02:28:57.455 --> 02:28:58.176]  He's a liar.
[02:28:58.516 --> 02:28:59.096]  You need to do something.
[02:28:59.116 --> 02:29:02.218]  They're like, no, he's on the radio here, but technically he doesn't work there.
[02:29:02.258 --> 02:29:02.699]  Well, no.
[02:29:02.979 --> 02:29:03.459]  Well, good.
[02:29:03.479 --> 02:29:05.040]  And when our guys get there to interview him, they're like,
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:05.700]  You're a liar.
[02:29:06.041 --> 02:29:07.641]  You're not on KLBJ.
[02:29:07.681 --> 02:29:08.522]  You don't work there.
[02:29:08.742 --> 02:29:15.625]  And it was like some weird game to like make us bad and say we're liars because we want to cover them getting all these machine gun boats.
[02:29:20.948 --> 02:29:22.489]  Just bizarre how they operate.
[02:29:22.529 --> 02:29:23.049]  Stay there Bob.
[02:29:23.069 --> 02:29:24.610]  I want to get into the economy where it's going.
[02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:29.673]  What you think people should do to try to get this impeachment going against Obama because
[02:29:31.047 --> 02:29:35.391]  I was always saying Obama's a puppet, but now he has been given dictator power.
[02:29:35.471 --> 02:29:37.253]  It's illegitimate, but he's actually taking it.
[02:29:37.653 --> 02:29:42.178]  And to go in and slap the senators around, man, they must have some dirt on them.
[02:29:42.318 --> 02:29:42.558]  Wow.
[02:29:42.578 --> 02:29:44.120]  I want to get Bob's take on that.
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:45.401]  The Dave Mustaine thing's coming up.
[02:29:45.421 --> 02:29:48.124]  I'll also tell you about, well, I'll tell you about it when we come back.
[02:29:48.804 --> 02:29:49.725]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.226 --> 02:29:51.807]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.748 --> 02:29:55.431]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.329 --> 02:30:03.571]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:03.871 --> 02:30:04.492]  Number one.
[02:30:04.792 --> 02:30:07.954]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:08.214 --> 02:30:08.794]  Number two.
[02:30:09.074 --> 02:30:13.637]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:13.977 --> 02:30:14.417]  It's true.
[02:30:14.717 --> 02:30:19.260]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:20.101]  Number 3.
[02:30:20.401 --> 02:30:23.704]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:23.984 --> 02:30:27.707]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:27.908 --> 02:30:28.448]  Number 4.
[02:30:28.688 --> 02:30:31.070]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:31.471 --> 02:30:34.814]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:35.134 --> 02:30:39.836]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.056 --> 02:30:44.837]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:45.117 --> 02:30:49.139]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:49.299 --> 02:30:50.839]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.079 --> 02:30:55.681]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:00.185 --> 02:31:01.687]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.907 --> 02:31:06.932]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:31:07.212 --> 02:31:08.573]  Saving means to make money.
[02:31:08.754 --> 02:31:17.542]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:31:18.263 --> 02:31:25.367]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:31:25.807 --> 02:31:33.411]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:38.733]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:31:39.034 --> 02:31:41.195]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:31:59.324 --> 02:32:04.027]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[02:32:04.307 --> 02:32:18.895]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand, eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[02:32:49.346 --> 02:32:52.049]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:33:29.818 --> 02:33:30.339]  I think so.
[02:33:58.095 --> 02:34:05.181]  Okay, we're going back to Bob Chapman here in just a moment to cover a host of news with him and also ask him what's coming out tomorrow as International Forecaster.
[02:34:05.641 --> 02:34:07.122]  Internationalforecaster.com.
[02:34:07.183 --> 02:34:07.863]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:34:08.384 --> 02:34:12.767]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:34:14.248 --> 02:34:19.373]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones and then of course we have a big Facebook page and a lot more.
[02:34:22.055 --> 02:34:25.317]  I'm still just speechless how they're openly saying the UN runs
[02:34:26.365 --> 02:34:27.287]  The presidency.
[02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:32.938]  And again, next time they do it, we won't be as shocked, but I'm going to get to all that in a moment.
[02:34:34.141 --> 02:34:43.764]  Dave Mustaine, one of the founders, of course, of Metallica, and then Megadeth, rock royalty, is a Christian, a patriot, a listener of this show.
[02:34:43.804 --> 02:34:45.405]  His wife is another great person, Pam.
[02:34:45.445 --> 02:34:47.926]  I've talked to her on the phone a lot, but never met her in person.
[02:34:47.946 --> 02:34:49.166]  You know, met Dave in person before.
[02:34:49.186 --> 02:34:57.449]  It was really great spending a couple days with him here in Austin when they ended the latest leg of their Gigantor tour with Motorhead.
[02:34:58.269 --> 02:35:00.370]  And I've done some sit-down interviews with him before.
[02:35:00.390 --> 02:35:02.231]  I've done a lot of radio interviews with him over the years.
[02:35:04.207 --> 02:35:08.572]  One time I called up to get him on as a guest and found out he was already a listener.
[02:35:08.592 --> 02:35:10.774]  That's how we were able to get him like five, six years ago on the show.
[02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:13.958]  So he's been awake to a lot of what's going on for a very long time.
[02:35:14.799 --> 02:35:19.764]  We've got an extremely powerful, in-depth interview.
[02:35:20.822 --> 02:35:27.627]  With Dev Mustaine, and I'm going to air next week on the Nightly News, and I'll air excerpts of it the next day here on the radio.
[02:35:28.327 --> 02:35:28.928]  I haven't decided.
[02:35:28.968 --> 02:35:30.889]  I might air it first on the radio slash TV.
[02:35:31.209 --> 02:35:31.970]  We'll see what we do.
[02:35:32.970 --> 02:35:34.832]  But next Thursday, it will air.
[02:35:36.132 --> 02:35:37.734]  And so all of that is coming up.
[02:35:39.915 --> 02:35:45.039]  Let's go ahead and go to this little teaser piece that'll be posted at Infowars.com within the hour.
[02:35:45.099 --> 02:35:45.419]  Here it is.
[02:35:54.875 --> 02:36:00.558]  Something that everybody should aspire to do to make a contribution to this great nation for the good of everybody.
[02:36:01.378 --> 02:36:06.560]  And if you don't know the difference between what's right and what's wrong, just open your mind up.
[02:36:09.121 --> 02:36:11.362]  Dave Mustaine like you've never seen before.
[02:36:11.862 --> 02:36:15.104]  An InfoLords.com exclusive special report.
[02:36:15.304 --> 02:36:17.765]  We had people die in Castle Donington.
[02:36:17.785 --> 02:36:19.466]  We had people die when we did Rock in Rio.
[02:36:23.038 --> 02:36:29.901]  I went out there, I showed up in a neck brace, you know, and everybody's there going like, oh my god, what's happening, what's happening?
[02:36:29.961 --> 02:36:34.482]  I said, well, so-and-so called me this and, you know, I just want to show him that he's that.
[02:36:37.423 --> 02:36:38.984]  I don't want to play with any satanic bands.
[02:36:39.004 --> 02:36:43.225]  I'll play with bands that have darkness in them because we all have a little darkness in us or we wouldn't be human.
[02:36:43.605 --> 02:36:50.188]  But guys that are confessed Satanists and, you know, don't really have time for that.
[02:36:53.231 --> 02:36:56.814]  I can't take any credit for James' songwriting ability or his guitar playing.
[02:36:56.934 --> 02:37:00.537]  He blew my mind when he picked up the guitar the first time, because he used to just sing.
[02:37:00.557 --> 02:37:04.720]  And I did all the guitar playing, and in fact, I talked between every song, too.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:10.465]  And when he picked up the guitar the first time, I remember watching him, and I was like, oh my God, this guy's really, really good.
[02:37:10.785 --> 02:37:13.267]  And in fact, it almost intimidated me.
[02:37:15.922 --> 02:37:19.844]  You know, the road got smooth and my career's turned around.
[02:37:19.864 --> 02:37:22.386]  I've got my best friend back playing bass with me.
[02:37:22.426 --> 02:37:23.326]  My kids like me.
[02:37:23.366 --> 02:37:24.867]  You know, traffic's gotten better.
[02:37:24.887 --> 02:37:28.049]  You know, it's just a whole complete paradigm shift.
[02:37:28.069 --> 02:37:29.450]  The universe lays before you.
[02:37:29.770 --> 02:37:32.091]  It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.
[02:37:32.131 --> 02:37:32.731]  That's right.
[02:37:46.468 --> 02:37:49.736]  Coming to the InfoWar next Thursday.
[02:37:54.173 --> 02:37:55.334]  All right, there you go.
[02:37:55.354 --> 02:38:02.020]  And we're going to put that out very, very soon on Infowars.com in the next hour or so.
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:03.721]  But it is an in-depth interview.
[02:38:03.741 --> 02:38:07.744]  He talks about Metallica and other things that he's never, never discussed before.
[02:38:07.784 --> 02:38:09.646]  He said a lot of it has never before been heard.
[02:38:10.286 --> 02:38:11.908]  And I'm like, wow, you're going to tell me all this?
[02:38:12.308 --> 02:38:14.910]  So that's coming out and it'll definitely make the news.
[02:38:15.711 --> 02:38:17.212]  He's got some political stuff in there as well.
[02:38:17.252 --> 02:38:19.214]  You know, his whole Santorum thing was taken out of context.
[02:38:19.594 --> 02:38:20.995]  He responds to that as well.
[02:38:21.556 --> 02:38:22.376]  You know, I tell you, Bob,
[02:38:24.545 --> 02:38:26.466]  Freedom is getting more and more popular.
[02:38:27.066 --> 02:38:40.973]  Again, I don't do this to brag about myself, neither do you when you talk about all the contacts you get, most of them off-record, but when I go to a rock concert now, you know, just three years ago I'd go to a rock concert, maybe every ten people would stop me.
[02:38:41.933 --> 02:38:46.175]  I went behind the scenes, I'm like the roadies for three different bands, like half of them were listeners.
[02:38:46.236 --> 02:38:52.699]  I heard the show today, and then I was out in the crowd, and like every third person was a listener.
[02:38:53.723 --> 02:38:54.703]  It was just incredible.
[02:38:54.743 --> 02:38:56.584]  I mean, Liberty is getting popular.
[02:38:56.944 --> 02:38:59.485]  I think that's why the globalists are trying to accelerate their whole program.
[02:39:02.226 --> 02:39:07.188]  As you said, Alex, we're breathing down their neck and I don't know what to do about it.
[02:39:07.328 --> 02:39:22.994]  They're losing the info war and we just got to keep on hammering away until we break them down and take them over and take over the financial system so they can't do what they're doing and using it as a base of power.
[02:39:26.428 --> 02:39:29.412]  You know what I'm worried about, Bob, is them trying to stage a false flag.
[02:39:29.492 --> 02:39:33.036]  I really see that being one of the only ace cards they've got right now.
[02:39:35.019 --> 02:39:35.579]  And you're right.
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:40.605]  And there's very little we can do to control that unless we find out about it ahead of time.
[02:39:41.607 --> 02:39:43.489]  And I don't know whether we can do that or not.
[02:39:46.601 --> 02:39:56.443]  I want to get into the technicals on the economy, what's going on with gold and silver, other commodities going up like oil, what's happening in the Euro, what's the latest development since we talked?
[02:39:57.623 --> 02:40:15.887]  Well, it's supposedly the price of oil is selling where it's at because of the disruptions in the Middle East which have been caused by the United States government and others in embargoing the usage of the financial system as well as the sale of the oil of Iran.
[02:40:16.628 --> 02:40:20.511]  And Iran sells their oil now in currencies other than dollars.
[02:40:21.651 --> 02:40:31.337]  And you're into the same fight over the petrodollar as you were with Gaddafi saying, I want a golden dinar.
[02:40:32.358 --> 02:40:44.846]  Or Saddam Hussein who said, I'm going to sell oil in non-dollar currencies, and he did for a couple of years, and he ended up at the end of the rope.
[02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:47.984]  These people are vicious animals.
[02:40:49.185 --> 02:40:52.307]  And they're going to continue to press and press and press.
[02:40:53.488 --> 02:41:15.205]  And I think, really, if they can pull it off, what you're afraid of, the false flag operation, would be something, if they don't screw it up, that could really impress upon people that they need government.
[02:41:16.079 --> 02:41:18.041]  And so hopefully they can't pull that off.
[02:41:21.503 --> 02:41:26.788]  What's the big, big trigger you're looking for in the economy that could accelerate the collapse?
[02:41:26.848 --> 02:41:36.155]  More and more of the system is admitting that we're really in a depression, but that, well, you know, the Federal Reserve's come out and said we're headed towards the edge of that cliff.
[02:41:36.175 --> 02:41:38.837]  Well, of course, they put us on that trajectory.
[02:41:40.919 --> 02:41:41.539]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:43.266 --> 02:41:49.389]  I think the catalyst, although it seems mundane after several years, is going to be Europe.
[02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:59.455]  This deal that was made today, which refinances, bails out again Greece, is a loser.
[02:42:01.496 --> 02:42:11.261]  In January, revenues were up like 4.5% for the government, and spending was up plus 8.5%.
[02:42:13.183 --> 02:42:19.064]  So, they're not making any headway, and they're not going to make any headway, and they don't care about making headway.
[02:42:19.664 --> 02:42:21.405]  And so that deal is going to fall asunder.
[02:42:22.025 --> 02:42:22.765]  And they know that.
[02:42:23.425 --> 02:42:40.249]  And a very important thing that happened last week is in Karlsruhe, Germany, the Federal District Court, Federal National Court, I'll call it that rather than go into German, they said that this new vehicle to finance
[02:42:41.007 --> 02:43:02.644]  These financially unsound countries, which had previously been under something called the EFSF, the Germans and others want to use this new ESM in order to do that by rolling EFSF into ESM.
[02:43:03.665 --> 02:43:04.346]  They can't do it.
[02:43:04.946 --> 02:43:09.550]  The German court says that is illegal under the Constitution.
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:19.722]  So they either have to pass an amendment or something, or they're not going to be able to allocate funds to ESM.
[02:43:21.002 --> 02:43:23.943]  And of course, part of ESM was even more austerity.
[02:43:24.443 --> 02:43:37.966]  I mean, don't the Germans think for one second, when you have austerity down the road, the people who you're exporting to, that they're going to have less of an economy because of the austerity.
[02:43:38.546 --> 02:43:39.186]  And that means
[02:43:39.642 --> 02:43:47.490]  You're not going to be able to export as much to them as you did before, which means their economy is going down.
[02:43:47.610 --> 02:43:49.112]  There's a chain reaction.
[02:43:50.453 --> 02:43:50.974]  Exactly.
[02:43:51.494 --> 02:43:52.235]  All right.
[02:43:53.136 --> 02:43:55.298]  That is a nightmare, believe me.
[02:43:55.679 --> 02:43:58.522]  They're no closer now than they were three years ago.
[02:43:59.241 --> 02:44:03.824]  All right, I want to shift gears into Kony 2012 in just a minute and get your take on this.
[02:44:04.304 --> 02:44:07.146]  I'm going to give you a briefing here, Bob, and get your analysis on it.
[02:44:07.987 --> 02:44:18.634]  But first, I want to just ask you briefly what you think we should do to try to resist this open UN, Pentagon, globalist, banker,
[02:44:19.534 --> 02:44:20.114]  Coup d'etat.
[02:44:20.154 --> 02:44:23.416]  I mean, they admit in Time Magazine that it's a banker coup.
[02:44:24.056 --> 02:44:24.816]  Here's the article.
[02:44:25.437 --> 02:44:28.318]  Regime change in Europe did recently amount to a banker's coup.
[02:44:28.358 --> 02:44:30.179]  And they say, yes, but the bankers know how to run it.
[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:40.264]  Congressman Walter Jones and senators have introduced the H. Con Res 107 or House Res 107.
[02:44:40.304 --> 02:44:44.746]  And they say it's a high crime and that if he doesn't reverse himself, they're going to initiate
[02:44:46.866 --> 02:44:47.306]  Impeachment?
[02:44:47.326 --> 02:44:50.068]  Well, that needs to happen when Congress said you gotta get permission for Libyan.
[02:44:50.109 --> 02:44:51.109]  He said, no, I have the UN.
[02:44:51.470 --> 02:44:58.195]  Just because the Pentagon came in and disgraced you, you already disgraced yourself passing the NDAA.
[02:44:59.383 --> 02:45:09.969]  You already, so yeah, if you want to come to your senses, of course they came in in front of the world, said Congress has no authority, and they're ceremonial, just like Caesar did in 49 BC.
[02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:18.274]  But I think everybody should call the Judiciary Committee over impeachment and say, look, the whole world knows what's going on here.
[02:45:18.854 --> 02:45:20.896]  You either tell those traitors over at the Pentagon
[02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:22.779]  Because the military's waking up.
[02:45:23.719 --> 02:45:29.103]  They better come out and say, yes, our commander-in-chief is the president during war, and Congress is in charge of the president.
[02:45:29.403 --> 02:45:33.486]  I want to hear that chain of command right now, or this is a coup that's been successful.
[02:45:33.646 --> 02:45:34.387]  This is a big deal.
[02:45:34.807 --> 02:45:36.048]  We can't just take this sitting down.
[02:45:36.068 --> 02:45:37.549]  We've been trained to accept so much.
[02:45:37.909 --> 02:45:39.050]  Nobody put up with this.
[02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:41.912]  Coups are one thing, but foreign coups through puppets?
[02:45:42.432 --> 02:45:43.593]  Nobody puts up with that.
[02:45:44.173 --> 02:45:48.655]  You think Mexico would put up with the President openly saying he takes his orders from the U.S.?
[02:45:49.175 --> 02:45:52.977]  Even if it's true that the big banks give him... I mean, they would riot in a minute and overthrow the government.
[02:45:53.277 --> 02:45:54.818]  The police and military would walk out.
[02:45:55.198 --> 02:45:56.939]  And that's a third world police state.
[02:45:57.539 --> 02:46:00.361]  I mean, do we have any basic honor?
[02:46:00.881 --> 02:46:01.341]  Anything?
[02:46:01.761 --> 02:46:02.402]  Here's the number.
[02:46:02.422 --> 02:46:02.462]  202-225-3951.
[02:46:02.482 --> 02:46:02.602]  202-225-3951.
[02:46:02.622 --> 02:46:03.302]  Judiciary Committee.
[02:46:09.505 --> 02:46:12.507]  Well, all of the people who are on the air, such as myself, should put the word out, of course.
[02:46:38.248 --> 02:46:42.469]  All of you people who are blogging on the internet, you should do the same thing.
[02:46:43.209 --> 02:46:50.270]  And all of you people out there, give encouragement to these people who step forward and expose what's being done here.
[02:46:51.010 --> 02:47:04.613]  And also, it doesn't hurt, a short note to every congressman, and just tell them, we know what you're doing, and we want that reversed, because it's unconstitutional.
[02:47:05.562 --> 02:47:09.743]  And if you don't, you're going to have an awful lot of people mad at you.
[02:47:35.629 --> 02:47:43.039]  Uh, Joseph Kony is a good guy, but he has a few thousand followers, maybe 500 ragtag troops.
[02:47:43.079 --> 02:47:44.561]  He does use child soldiers.
[02:47:45.353 --> 02:47:53.779]  Because in the area, the kids just starve, so it's always been that way in Africa and many other areas that are primitive in their technological development.
[02:47:53.799 --> 02:47:56.842]  The kids either starve or they're brought in and trained as soldiers.
[02:47:57.442 --> 02:48:03.467]  I mean, in the old days, they had nine-year-olds they would grab off the streets in England and force into military service.
[02:48:03.507 --> 02:48:07.610]  I mean, that's as old as civilization, when civilization was more primitive.
[02:48:08.610 --> 02:48:11.693]  The point is that Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, all of them,
[02:48:12.967 --> 02:48:17.569]  Kim Kardashian, all these Hollywood people, George Clooney, are behind this Kony 2012.
[02:48:17.869 --> 02:48:22.051]  And the symbol is a donkey and elephant together saying one thing we can all agree on.
[02:48:22.111 --> 02:48:24.332]  Well, this is what we predicted in the Obama deception.
[02:48:24.852 --> 02:48:27.353]  It is an Afrikan invasion.
[02:48:29.401 --> 02:48:34.549]  Of Africa, the beachhead in Libya, murdering, mass murder there, destabilization using Al-Qaeda.
[02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:42.502]  The current leader of Uganda was connected in the last 20 years to other groups that have been involved in more than 7 million killed.
[02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:48.390]  So, they're literally comparing him to Hitler, this new guy, Kony, who's like a nobody.
[02:48:48.670 --> 02:48:50.251]  Like a Beverly Hillbilly or something.
[02:48:50.491 --> 02:48:52.773]  They've got Hitler next to Bin Laden, next to Kony.
[02:48:53.213 --> 02:48:54.154]  He's the new Hitler.
[02:48:54.694 --> 02:48:57.676]  And this video's gotten 50 million views in five days.
[02:48:58.196 --> 02:49:00.097]  It's being promoted by every globalist outfit.
[02:49:00.157 --> 02:49:04.140]  Bill Gates is promoting it, who openly says he wants to reduce the population of Africa.
[02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:11.445]  And they're targeting school kids, and they're flooding us saying, you've got to stand for the children that are being kidnapped by Kony.
[02:49:12.645 --> 02:49:14.667]  And turn into military minions.
[02:49:15.548 --> 02:49:19.030]  Well, that's standard all across the entire continent.
[02:49:19.491 --> 02:49:20.691]  And goes on in many other continents.
[02:49:20.711 --> 02:49:25.595]  But the point is, it's purely... In fact, they say in these news reports they wanted to make him the villain.
[02:49:25.975 --> 02:49:26.856]  They don't even hide that.
[02:49:26.916 --> 02:49:32.660]  So it's just like they use Remington's paintings to claim the Spanish were slaughtering people in Cuba in 1898.
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:35.723]  And, you know, the head of Hearst Publishing
[02:49:36.723 --> 02:49:40.105]  said, give me the images, I'll give you a war.
[02:49:40.685 --> 02:49:53.271]  So this is pure war propaganda, and they've now got the whole anti-war left calling for war in Libya, calling for it in Syria, calling for it in Iran, and calling for an AFRICOM invasion by U.S.
[02:49:53.311 --> 02:49:58.253]  forces, as Tarpley predicted three and a half years ago in Obama deception, in the Congo-wide area.
[02:49:58.853 --> 02:50:01.915]  And you watch, if this gets kicked off, genocide
[02:50:02.415 --> 02:50:10.480]  And I'll have to have trendies lecturing me on how great they are, because they're gonna get some little ragtag guy in one tiny area who's a joke.
[02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:13.542]  I mean, it's just, they go, here's the bad man, invade!
[02:50:13.822 --> 02:50:14.923]  People are like, kill!
[02:50:15.383 --> 02:50:17.885]  I mean, it's like Saddam and the baby incubators.
[02:50:18.005 --> 02:50:20.747]  I'm gonna come back from break and get Bob's take on this, but...
[02:50:22.711 --> 02:50:24.352]  People kept calling me about this the last two days.
[02:50:24.732 --> 02:50:25.593]  I looked into it.
[02:50:26.914 --> 02:50:30.296]  And they're targeting 10, 12, 13, 14-year-olds.
[02:50:30.656 --> 02:50:41.183]  And they've got all these little kids spamming the web with it, people crying and getting donations for money, for the UN, just like they had Blood Diamond movies about, there's African countries where they mine their own diamonds.
[02:50:41.383 --> 02:50:42.443]  They have child labor!
[02:50:42.884 --> 02:50:47.507]  It's the UN and De Beers that's running around enslaving people and doing all this.
[02:50:48.147 --> 02:50:50.749]  And Blood Diamond's the money that the Rothschilds don't get.
[02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:53.771]  I mean, literally, they use this humanitarian cover.
[02:50:54.091 --> 02:50:55.692]  It's pure propaganda.
[02:50:55.712 --> 02:50:57.573]  The West wants Africans dead.
[02:50:57.813 --> 02:50:59.734]  And this will be the pretext to go in there and kill them.
[02:50:59.794 --> 02:51:01.475]  Healthy soils grow healthy plants.
[02:51:01.835 --> 02:51:05.297]  So before you plant your survival garden this year, is your soil healthy?

[02:52:58.905 --> 02:53:00.666]  What is the most abundant resource on Earth?
[02:53:01.247 --> 02:53:01.507]  Water.
[02:53:01.767 --> 02:53:05.010]  It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available.
[02:53:05.211 --> 02:53:11.877]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves, like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin.
[02:53:11.997 --> 02:53:14.500]  Three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:18.384]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.
[02:53:18.644 --> 02:53:20.065]  Get a FlowJack hand well pump.
[02:53:20.186 --> 02:53:29.175]  The affordable FlowJack drops right into almost any well and is easy to install without having to remove the existing pump, giving you immediate access to plenty of cool, clean water.
[02:53:29.335 --> 02:53:36.758]  You could risk your family's health on a limited supply of stored water, or you could be prepared with the reliable, affordable FloJack Backup Hand Pump Kit.

[02:53:55.324 --> 02:53:56.584]  FloJack Hand Well Pumps.
[02:53:56.744 --> 02:53:57.945]  Peace of mind in a box.
[02:54:21.213 --> 02:54:26.917]  Of course, I forgot my biggest point on the whole Kony situation.
[02:54:26.937 --> 02:54:30.160]  This is all about legitimizing the International Criminal Court.
[02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:36.204]  Anybody that resists the New World Order, they had that five-nation group of commandos led by the U.S.
[02:54:36.224 --> 02:54:37.465]  try to go in and kill this guy.
[02:54:38.266 --> 02:54:50.409]  Just because he's one little resistor, and now he's being used as the poster boy to have full-on invasion against all sorts of others, liking Muslim and Christian on both sides, and even animist, to invade the whole area.
[02:54:51.270 --> 02:55:01.613]  Bob Chapman, I mean, we've got the West that loves killing a million Iraqis, loves doing all this, and now we have Kim Kardashian, all the big liberals, and George Clooney with Bill Gates.
[02:55:03.393 --> 02:55:06.414]  And I noticed on YouTube, and people got snapshots of this,
[02:55:07.338 --> 02:55:11.479]  Within live time, it went up like a million views in an hour when they launched it five days ago.
[02:55:11.499 --> 02:55:20.782]  Well, everybody knows, even when we've had stuff with hundreds of thousands of views or anybody else, it says 301 or 306 while it caches, then waits half a day before the numbers start updating.
[02:55:21.043 --> 02:55:23.843]  But you can always tell when it's, it probably hasn't had 50 million views.
[02:55:24.264 --> 02:55:27.905]  I mean, YouTube is heavily involved with Obama, Google that owns it is.
[02:55:28.285 --> 02:55:34.467]  What's your take on them inventing a new boogeyman and saying, he's Hitler, he's Bin Laden, we've now got to invade Africa?
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:44.826]  Well, there's a long history of this, especially after the years which began the decolonization of Africa.
[02:55:45.987 --> 02:55:55.755]  And I lived in Africa for several years, mostly in Southern Africa, which would be South Africa and Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe.
[02:55:56.355 --> 02:56:02.800]  And I spent a lot of time in Mozambique and Angola, Zambia, which used to be Northern Rhodesia.
[02:56:03.741 --> 02:56:05.522]  But, as you say,
[02:56:06.269 --> 02:56:21.156]  There aren't many jobs around and it's pretty easy to recruit people to get involved in wars or disruptions and they don't care whether they get killed or not.
[02:56:22.176 --> 02:56:34.401]  They get really very little to live for and that's been going on for a long time but the bottom line here is that usually what has happened is an outside group like BP or
[02:56:36.209 --> 02:56:40.975]  Exxon or De Beers or whatever, they're behind the whole thing.
[02:56:41.796 --> 02:56:55.753]  And they take a fellow like the one you've been mentioning and they round up a bunch of people for him and give them guns and say, go off in that direction up there and raise heck because you're supposed to do that.
[02:56:56.687 --> 02:56:57.568]  And they do it.
[02:56:57.928 --> 02:56:59.010]  Let me expand on this.
[02:56:59.050 --> 02:57:01.892]  We're not even saying that this Kony guy is a good guy.
[02:57:02.133 --> 02:57:04.475]  He's literally a nobody out there.
[02:57:04.515 --> 02:57:08.739]  It's an excuse to bring in AFRICOM and this huge U.S.
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:12.463]  global buildup for a new colonialism publicly.
[02:57:12.824 --> 02:57:19.010]  And they've got the left now, who usually is anti-war but has been silent, is cheering for war.
[02:57:20.291 --> 02:57:23.312]  And they could care less about the children.
[02:57:23.332 --> 02:57:25.173]  It's all the invisible children.
[02:57:25.653 --> 02:57:27.294]  Oh, Coney's like Hitler.
[02:57:27.814 --> 02:57:29.094]  Oh, we care so much.
[02:57:29.174 --> 02:57:35.416]  And it's all about selling people on going in and carrying out globalist eugenics in Africa.
[02:57:35.436 --> 02:57:37.257]  I mean, Bill Gates has said he wants them dead.
[02:57:37.277 --> 02:57:39.978]  And it's Bill Gates.
[02:57:40.058 --> 02:57:41.138]  I mean, it is sick.
[02:57:41.278 --> 02:57:42.359]  Isn't that sick, Bob?
[02:57:42.379 --> 02:57:44.399]  It certainly is.
[02:57:44.619 --> 02:57:49.041]  And, you know, those poor people have enough problems just surviving.
[02:57:49.935 --> 02:57:54.998]  And I know I had a business there, we had 300 people working for us, and I didn't even need half the people.
[02:57:55.618 --> 02:57:57.339]  I used to hire them just so they'd have a job.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:01.961]  What was funny is, every once in a while, one would disappear.
[02:58:02.802 --> 02:58:04.883]  And about two or three months later, he'd come back.
[02:58:06.664 --> 02:58:08.565]  And he'd say, I'm ready for work, boss.
[02:58:09.625 --> 02:58:10.406]  And I said, really?
[02:58:10.446 --> 02:58:10.986]  Where you been?
[02:58:11.006 --> 02:58:13.247]  He says, out in the tribal trust land.
[02:58:14.288 --> 02:58:18.170]  I said, well, I don't have any place for you right now.
[02:58:19.011 --> 02:58:21.292]  Why did you go away and come back?
[02:58:21.312 --> 02:58:23.473]  He said, oh, it was time for me to see my wife.
[02:58:24.394 --> 02:58:27.896]  So this is the kind of mentality that you're dealing with.
[02:58:28.756 --> 02:58:30.017]  It's very rudimentary.
[02:58:33.259 --> 02:58:35.400]  It's too bad, but that's the way it is.
[02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:37.701]  And that's how they recruit people.
[02:58:37.741 --> 02:58:38.682]  Yeah, that's what's going on.

[02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:57.252]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:58:57.532 --> 02:58:58.892]  Saving means to make money.
