[00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:13.869]  We're out here at the Formula One racetrack right outside of Austin, Texas.
[00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.430]  It is deafening loud.
[00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.330]  We have helicopters flying overhead.
[00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:20.111]  As you can hear, I believe they're in the practice runs behind me.
[00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:27.134]  You can also see behind me some military personnel, and we're just curious as to why they're out here directing traffic, so let's go see if we can get a word.
[00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:29.475]  Sir, what are you doing out here today?
[00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:31.175]  We're out here just supporting the event.
[00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:38.998]  The coordinators for the event asked if we would be out here to be available to support in this, as far as traffic control and things of that nature, so we're just out here supporting the event.
[00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:42.333]  We're just here to support the Travis County Police Department.
[00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:45.494]  We're out here in support of the local civilian authorities.
[00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.516]  Any large public event like this, there's always a public safety concern.
[00:00:50.336 --> 00:01:00.060]  We're out here, much like the local law enforcement is, just to make sure everybody has a good, safe time and just to help out our friends in the local civilian sector.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.821]  What branch of the military are you with, sir?
[00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.322]  Texas Army National Guard.
[00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.743]  We're with the Texas Army National Guard.
[00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:07.643]  And what branch of the military are you with?
[00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:08.704]  Army National Guard.
[00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.109]  Have you ever heard of posse comitatus?
[00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:11.809]  No, sir.
[00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.910]  And have you ever heard of posse comitatus?
[00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.770]  I have.
[00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.971]  Briefly, can you explain to us what that is, sir?
[00:01:19.732 --> 00:01:22.633]  I'm afraid I'm not good enough with the law to be able to do that.
[00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:25.074]  Are you doing anything besides directing traffic, sir?
[00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:29.995]  No, we're just assisting under the civil authorities.
[00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:33.557]  The civil authorities you're referring to, what?
[00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.318]  Immediately it's under the governor, but
[00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:42.410]  We're assisting Travis County, then the local law enforcement with them.
[00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.232]  Alright, thank you for your time, sir.
[00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:50.637]  Now the race has officially begun and we've had to move even farther out into the parking lot to avoid the noise.
[00:01:51.017 --> 00:02:01.925]  Now the soldiers we spoke with weren't too familiar with posse commentatus, which separates police and military, but the soldier did point out there is a chain of command, but ultimately they're here under the direction of Governor Rick Perry.
[00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.427]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News.
