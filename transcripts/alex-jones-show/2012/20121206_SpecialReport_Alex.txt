[00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:29.980]  The immense popularity of Black Friday and the introduction of Thanksgiving Day shopping this year is prompting many Americans to question the mental health of people who participate in these events.
[00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:39.382]  The success of Thanksgiving Day shopping has also prompted many media outlets to hint that Christmas Day shopping could be introduced to the public in coming years.
[00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.983]  We asked local Allstonites what they think of this prospect.
[00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:45.303]  Okay, do you want a Black Friday Christmas?
[00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:45.704]  No.
[00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:46.984]  No.
[00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:47.564]  No.
[00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:48.924]  Why not?
[00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:55.367]  Because you have 364 other days to shop and I don't think people should shop on Christmas Day.
[00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:56.748]  Absolutely not.
[00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:08.933]  I believe that Black Friday for Thanksgiving is already enough for the American consumer and Black Friday Christmas will destroy everything really Christmas is about.
[00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:11.414]  Finally destroy it for real.
[00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:13.575]  No.
[00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:15.656]  Why not?
[00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.268]  First of all, I don't even know what it is.
[00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:19.428]  Absolutely not.
[00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.310]  Um, I think that that would ruin Christmas.
[00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.472]  It just would, to make it its own holiday, would be... I don't know.
[00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:27.692]  I don't like it.
[00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:28.813]  That'd be awesome.
[00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:31.114]  Yes, definitely.
[00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:31.954]  I think it would help.
[00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.515]  I mean, if they want to be open, go for it.
[00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:35.976]  I'm not going to be out there shopping.
[00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:39.077]  So I'll be with family, hanging out at home, relaxing.
[00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:42.899]  What are your thoughts when you see videos of people trampling each other for cheap products?
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.700]  White trash.
[00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:47.711]  What are my thoughts?
[00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.332]  I would never, number one, stand in that line.
[00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:54.892]  Number two, I would never trample over people to get something at Walmart.
[00:01:55.013 --> 00:02:06.735]  I feel like they've lost all connection with humans and they see humans as sort of just a roadblock in their life, I guess.
[00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:11.376]  They're just completely closed off to others and just really simple-minded.
[00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.256]  Well, I think it's funny, like I said.
[00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.339]  Don't people get trampled?
[00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.543]  You think it's funny?
[00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.590]  I think it's sad.
[00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.920]  Well, it's kind of hard for me to say because I'm one of them sometimes.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.141]  It's kind of an adrenaline rush to see, you know, they have five products at this price and there's 20 people going for it.
[00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.782]  You know, who can, it's like, who can win the trophy?
[00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:40.603]  Well, I'm working in the medical field and we had a lot of people that actually had broken bones because of Black Friday.
[00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:46.384]  You know, they got the TV, but they had a $4,000 doctor bill to go along with it.
[00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:56.756]  According to the National Retail Federation, stores that were open this past Thanksgiving Day experienced a 22% increase in profits over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
[00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:05.438]  According to the Wall Street Journal, in past years, many retail stores were also closed for Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor Day.
[00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:09.880]  What do you think of the fact that a lot of experts say that the discounts on Black Friday aren't even that great?
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.160]  I agree.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.880]  Totally agree.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.800]  They're not that great.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.961]  They just make you spend more money.
[00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.570]  They're not that good.
[00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.073]  You can get the same discounts if you just watch the ads and look online.
[00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:23.314]  I didn't know that.
[00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:24.775]  That's pretty interesting, though.
[00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:26.096]  I didn't know that either.
[00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:34.602]  I mean, the first toy that I ever got from Black Friday was the Game Boy Color, and it was like $40 when we got it at the time.
[00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.683]  That was something that cost $200.
[00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:39.786]  So I always thought Black Friday was a great deal.
[00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:45.670]  Does the Black Friday-dization of society boost holiday morale or hurt holiday morale, in your opinion?
[00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:50.644]  I don't know if it boosts or hurts but it certainly changes the focus and that's the problem.
[00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:52.366]  I mean it can boost it.
[00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:55.468]  It can because I mean it's kind of a family thing.
[00:03:55.488 --> 00:04:02.073]  A lot of families make it an event to go and get everyone together so in a way it can create like a family thing.
