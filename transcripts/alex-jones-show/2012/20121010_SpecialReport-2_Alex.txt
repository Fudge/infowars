[00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:10.797]  You got Obama phone?
[00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:11.077]  Yes!
[00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:14.458]  Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone!
[00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.840]  Keep Obama in president, you know!
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.320]  He gave us a phone!
[00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:19.781]  He's gonna do more!
[00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:30.487]  As the Obama phone video continues to go viral, the video has prompted many Americans to criticize the welfare state and the pitiful results most welfare programs have produced.
[00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:39.091]  One such program is the Lifeline Benefit Program, which has received rave reviews from the Obama phone lady and other low-income residents.
[00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:41.652]  I have about like six in my personnel.
[00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:43.653]  Each and every one of these phones work.
[00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:46.955]  At home I know I have about thirty and all I'm on.
[00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:52.898]  Do you think it's a good idea for the federal government to charge three dollars on your cell bill to give people free cell phones?
[00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.519]  I don't think so.
[00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.842]  I think a cell phone's not unnecessary, so I don't think the government has this right to do that.
[00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:01.255]  Not at all.
[00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.776]  That's completely garbage.
[00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:06.179]  I mean, I pay a hundred plus a month for my cell phone.
[00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.201]  I don't see why they're handing out free cell phones to other people.
[00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:10.281]  No.
[00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:12.002]  Why not?
[00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:14.944]  Well, I think it's a product.
[00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.086]  If people want to buy it and can afford to buy it, they should.
[00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.508]  But I don't think the government should be handing them out.
[00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:24.885]  Handing somebody a cell phone is an opportunity to get a job.
[00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.466]  It's an opportunity to call back your employer.
[00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:29.008]  There is no more public phones.
[00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.990]  So you can't just ask them to shove them in the public phones.
[00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.852]  They've been reduced by 90% in this country.
[00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:36.454]  So I think there should be a program.
[00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:42.158]  But every American who has a cell phone to pay $3 without being asked, that's not American in my book.
[00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.839]  So it should be optional?
[00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.740]  It should be optional.
[00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.220]  Um, I don't think so.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:00.710]  I think that's a controversial question, but I think basic human rights like food, shelter, healthcare should be given by the government, but not commodities like cell phones, no.
[00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:09.377]  Yeah, you see, I do have an issue with people reducing really complicated issues down to quick sound bites.
[00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:16.120]  Generally, people that are receiving government benefits aren't living the high life and living in comfort.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.945]  So, I don't really have a problem with following the edict of helping the people that need the most help.
[00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:25.966]  I do.
[00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:30.508]  I think it's important to give a little to get a lot, and obviously we've all gotten a lot.
[00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:38.852]  I went to public school, I drive on the roads, I ride my bike in bike lanes, so I do believe in giving money so that other people can have something that I already have.
[00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:47.311]  Generally speaking, I don't have a problem with providing poor people with cell phones, especially when those poor people are women with children.
[00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:51.074]  And without cell phones, they find themselves in danger.
[00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:55.337]  We don't have pay phones anymore, so people can't just walk around the corner and use a phone.
[00:02:55.878 --> 00:03:03.664]  So a low-cost, bare-bones cell phone for safety only makes sense.
[00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:14.574]  The FCC, which oversees this initiative, says phone ownership among this group has increased by an estimated 12% since the program began in the 1980s.
[00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:22.382]  According to the Cato Institute, since President Barack Obama took office, federal welfare assistance has increased by an estimated 41%.
[00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:34.790]  The organization also notes that over the past half century, both the federal government and local governments have spent an estimated $15 trillion trying to combat poverty.
[00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.232]  However, during this time, the poverty rate has only decreased by about 4%.
[00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:41.173]  Is that stealing?
[00:03:41.953 --> 00:03:45.095]  I think it is because it's not the citizen's rights.
[00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:50.118]  I mean, it's not the obligation of the citizens to pay for other people's cell phones.
[00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:53.084]  It's stealing in a sense.
[00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:56.827]  In short, yes it is.
[00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:01.431]  What if it went to poor people?
[00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:03.552]  I'm not the richest guy either.
[00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:10.558]  I'm not poor, but I don't have a lot of money and I spend some of my money on my cell phone, so why can't other people?
[00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:12.219]  I don't think so.
[00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:13.841]  Why not?
[00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:16.908]  I think we all get a lot from the government.
[00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.310]  So I got roads, I got public school, etc.
[00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.113]  So I think public services are for the good of everybody.
[00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.154]  Well, I don't know if it's stealing.
[00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:28.016]  I think it's probably excessive spending on the federal government's part.
[00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:35.782]  I think, as far as three dollars go, you know, I don't think it's stealing from the American public.
[00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.945]  But I do think, I don't know, I guess you would have to,
[00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:43.784]  The public should be informed, is what I'm saying.
[00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:46.126]  So you should have access to the information of where it's going.
[00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:51.191]  If you don't, then I don't know if I would want to label it stealing, but I would label it wrong.
