[00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:05.122]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.584]  You want answers?
[00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:08.306]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:12.552]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:17.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:21.838]  Continuing already into the second hour here.
[00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:24.762]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:27.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and thank you for staying with us.
[00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:33.912]  We've been breaking down information on the Sikh temple shooting and of course
[00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:38.695]  Even what we've covered so far, it's a lot of data points.
[00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.556]  Not everything's confirmed yet.
[00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:41.717]  We are exploring.
[00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:43.098]  We are researching.
[00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.139]  This is happening in real time.
[00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.000]  So information is coming in.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.081]  We're going to try to connect the dots as best we can.
[00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:55.905]  And I know also, of course, you can you can just bet that in the next 24 hours, a lot more is going to come out on this.
[00:00:56.245 --> 00:01:01.889]  And Alex himself will be able to bring you more detailed breakdown of this entire event tomorrow.
[00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.590]  As he returns to hosting the show.
[00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.852]  But for today, continuing, here's what we've got coming up.
[00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:10.714]  We're going to continue with callers who have information.
[00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:18.660]  We've got Chris Holding and Rick and TJ and Clark and others, former and active law enforcement and some military.
[00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:25.387]  We've also got breaking news about another armed raid on a farmer in Canada this time.
[00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:27.149]  He's going to join us for just a few minutes.
[00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:40.180]  In the next hour, he's been charged with 14 counts of conspiracy, or wait a minute, facing 14 years in prison based on the conspiracy charges against him for farming sheep.
[00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:45.925]  Yes, farming, raising sheep on a farm in Canada.
[00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:48.687]  So the assault on farm freedom is continuing.
[00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:57.113]  We've also got information about the deception of the Susan G Komen organization has just been attacked.
[00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:14.068]  In the British Medical Journal, the BMJ, two scientists have come out and accused Komen of running deceptive advertising that intentionally misleads women into getting mammograms that nine times out of ten actually harm those women.
[00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:16.332]  So this is another assault.
[00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:26.336]  We've got news about the Obama campaign website now selling hemp scarves on their website, selling hemp products.
[00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.998]  But the hemp is imported from China, not the United States, because it's still expensive.
[00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:34.180]  It's a criminal offense to farm hemp in the United States.
[00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:38.944]  So why is the Obama administration or the Obama campaign marketing people?
[00:02:39.244 --> 00:02:48.151]  Why are they supporting communist Chinese jobs in China, but not allowing American farmers to grow hemp right here in the USA?
[00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:54.250]  Also, we've got breaking news about chemotherapy that's going to shock you.
[00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:58.674]  Just out yesterday, it turns out that chemotherapy causes cancer.
[00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:04.119]  Yes, chemotherapy causes cancer tumors to grow more aggressively.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.240]  It backfires.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.702]  This is shocking news.
[00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:07.462]  I don't know.
[00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:45.646]  And then getting back to the Second Amendment issue, we're going to continue to break down the Sikh Temple shooting and the assaults on the Second Amendment and the pattern of drills that always are found to be behind these shootings that have a specific agenda, that always go after helpless groups of people.
[00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:48.089]  Alex just said it on the phone in the last segment.
[00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:57.359]  That they're going to go after people in malls, in churches, in movie theaters, in stadiums, at sporting events.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:10.165]  This is where people are typically unarmed and easy to have shot in order to create mass casualties, in order to create the reaction, which is a nationwide call for gun control.
[00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:12.612]  And a disarmament of the public.
[00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.472]  But, you know what?
[00:04:13.572 --> 00:04:13.972]  Think about it.
[00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:17.914]  Gun control is not gun control of everybody.
[00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:18.534]  It's selective.
[00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:28.338]  It's only about controlling, or that is, disarming guns from the citizens while concentrating power, concentrating firearms in the hands of the government itself.
[00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:36.441]  So while they're working to disarm the American public, they're buying 450 million rounds of hollow point .40 caliber ammo.
[00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:37.382]  They're buying
[00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:40.163]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of AR-15 rifles.
[00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.704]  They're buying the .223 ammo, the .556.
[00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:46.286]  They are arming up while disarming us.
[00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:47.667]  That's the real agenda.
[00:04:48.147 --> 00:04:50.168]  So all of that straight ahead, plus more calls.
[00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:52.269]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:52.969]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:58.292]  The worst drought in 50 years continues.
[00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:02.454]  And the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:05.215]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
