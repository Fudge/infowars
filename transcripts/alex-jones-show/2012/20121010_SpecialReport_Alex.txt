[00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:02.292]  I'm David Knight, reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:05.993]  Just before I left for Austin, I took my family to the Smoky Mountains.
[00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:17.397]  Now, long before the Europeans named it the Smoky Mountains, the Cherokee had a name for it, and if I pronounce it correctly, it's something like Chakonokwe, which means Place of the Fine Particulate Smog.
[00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:18.758]  No, not actually.
[00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.699]  That's what the EPA wants you to think.
[00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.561]  I was surprised to see this graphic on the EPA's site where they explain what PM 2.5 is.
[00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:29.382]  They use the Smoky Mountains as a poster child.
[00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:34.967]  Is it really PM 2.5 and man-made smog that makes the Smoky Mountains smoky?
[00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:35.647]  No.
[00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:42.552]  We all know that it isn't, but we see this kind of thing done over and over again, like they did with polar bears on ice flows.
[00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:43.052]  Remember that?
[00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:51.338]  And of course, Al Gore is telling us that the oceans are rising, but he builds his $9 million mansion in Montecito, California, right on the ocean side.
[00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:53.960]  So I don't think he believes that either.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.843]  But they use these subliminal messages to try to convince us
[00:00:58.937 --> 00:01:00.218]  And they can be quite effective.
[00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:06.884]  Speaking of bears, every visitor to the Smoky Mountains gets a handout that looks like this, warning you about black bears.
[00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:15.631]  As my wife was reading that to the small children, I started thinking, a lot of the stuff they were saying about bears could be said about government, especially about the EPA.
[00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.713]  Let me just read a few things here.
[00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.797]  With aggressive behavior, the bear, the EPA, is demanding more space.
[00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:26.596]  If the bear, or EPA, continues to follow you, stand your ground.
[00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:28.958]  If the EPA gets closer, talk louder.
[00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:29.838]  Or shout at it.
[00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:30.879]  Act aggressively.
[00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:33.201]  Act together as a group if you have companions.
[00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.883]  Make yourself look as large as possible.
[00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:36.644]  Don't run.
[00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:37.605]  Don't turn away.
[00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.747]  And don't feed the EPA.
[00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:42.048]  It only encourages further problems.
[00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.871]  David Knight, for InfoWars Nightly News.
