[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.151]  Welcome to GCN.
[00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:03.154]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.083]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:16.544]  You want answers?
[00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:18.266]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:22.490]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.134]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:45.361]  It is Wednesday, the 5th day of December 2012.
[00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:50.946]  And I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:53.929]  We are going to have open phones today.
[00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.950]  We don't have any guests.
[00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.334]  We have a bunch of breaking special reports we're going to air here on the show today.
[00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:06.256]  Obviously, if you hear that my voice is deeper than normal.
[00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:11.197]  I went out to a federal building in Austin, Texas yesterday.
[00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:21.540]  One of my photographers and researchers, Molly Rogers, was in and around downtown Austin taking photos of surveillance cameras.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.761]  So we have stock footage of the Big Brother control grid.
[00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:30.314]  As any publication online or in print does.
[00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:35.077]  And they came out to her on the sidewalk and said, we'll arrest you.
[00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:35.857]  You look shady.
[00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.618]  It's illegal to photograph a federal building.
[00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:50.487]  So I went back down there yesterday and to find parking, had to park about a quarter mile away, left the bullhorn in the car, in the truck, forgot it.
[00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:52.735]  I don't know.
[00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:17.841]  And I'll tell the story later, and then we should have the video ready by the Nightly News tonight or tomorrow.
[00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:18.262]  Who knows?
[00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:26.288]  We've got so much on our plate right now, but we will play that video here on the radio because it's got audio, obviously, as I give a speech to them.
[00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:34.736]  And then as we're leaving, security guards come out and inform us that their listeners
[00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:41.504]  And that we have every right to photograph or videotape the facility, because this is not North Korea.
[00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:44.484]  And they said, in fact, we'll open the gate up for you.
[00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:48.525]  Why don't you try to go into the metal detectors and talk to the federal police officers?
[00:02:49.485 --> 00:03:03.968]  So we go in there, and they blow up at our cameras, and then I tell them this isn't North Korea, and explain that they'd come out, and the federal police officer that had done it to Mali was not there.
[00:03:04.992 --> 00:03:05.733]  I said, is that him?
[00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:06.233]  Is that him?
[00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:06.814]  She said, no.
[00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:08.816]  And she described him.
[00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.157]  And they said, well, we apologize.
[00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:10.897]  It's not illegal.
[00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:12.439]  We understand how that could have scared you.
[00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.741]  Because, you know, she came back to work and said, really?
[00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.282]  It's not illegal?
[00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:18.444]  I didn't think it was illegal.
[00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.886]  I didn't even know that was a federal building.
[00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.047]  I was just going around downtown.
[00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.088]  We sent her out there to do it.
[00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:23.529]  But she said, really?
[00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.190]  They'd lie to me and say they'd arrest me?
[00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:28.391]  And of course, you see that in the news all the time where they do arrest people.
[00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.112]  You see the courts ruling, obviously that's unconstitutional.
[00:03:31.772 --> 00:03:32.692]  But they just keep doing it.
[00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:40.314]  And so I told them, because they were kind of getting in our face, and I said, well, I'm going to sue you then for a civil rights violation, First Amendment official oppression.
[00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:41.854]  And they went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:48.035]  So we shook hands and they said, OK, here's a number for you or a place for you to file a complaint.
[00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:51.516]  We'll try to find out who did it, which I'm sure is just trying to get us out of there.
[00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:55.138]  But I'm not just there trying to get in the face of the federal government.
[00:03:55.238 --> 00:04:00.841]  I know it's an incredibly criminal, dangerous, horrible thing that runs Al-Qaeda publicly.
[00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:01.842]  That's in the news today.
[00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:13.569]  But if we let them operate like this is North Korea, pretty soon they'll be sending us to re-education camps if we don't cry at public events properly like in North Korea.
[00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.390]  And I'm not joking.
[00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.671]  That's how tyranny works.
[00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:17.872]  You give in to it,
[00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.714]  It takes you all the way.
[00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:24.660]  It's like tying a giant 10,000 pound lead weight to your ankle and throwing yourself into the ocean.
[00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.484]  With the lead weight, you're going to the bottom, you're dead.
[00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:29.387]  That's how turning works.
[00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:33.652]  It's got a big weight, it keeps going all the way until it hits resistance.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.260]  Okay.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.002]  And so I don't like being the tip of the spear because they are dangerous.
[00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:42.683]  But it's got to be done.
[00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:45.984]  That's why we went down to the NSA to say, hey, it's not illegal to film here.
[00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.724]  And they had to admit it.
[00:04:47.864 --> 00:04:53.426]  They detain and rob San Antonio Express News, newspaper reporters with cameras, TV stations.
[00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:57.668]  They take their stuff because they don't know how to say, hey, don't you engage in criminal activity?
[00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:00.609]  You gotta put the sunglasses on like they live.
[00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.151]  And once you can see, they go, I got one that can see.
[00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.031]  We'll be back.
[00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.873]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:10.814]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:05:11.114 --> 00:05:14.415]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:16.796]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:18.417]  These emergency backup systems
[00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:20.368]  Electrical power.
[00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.392]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:30.054]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:34.977]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:38.199]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts.
[00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.821]  You'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:42.142]  And here's the best news.

[00:08:31.264 --> 00:08:31.764]  Oh yeah!
[00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:37.387]  We got 50,000 waters all over the country.
[00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:57.817]  Talk about 50,000 unstoppable watts of AM radio, FM radio, global shortwave 100,000 watts, WWCR worldwide service, XM-166 and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com with the free audio streams, video streams at InfoWarsNews.com
[00:08:59.318 --> 00:09:01.259]  And that is Clutch bringing us in.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:17.611]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday, the fifth day of December 2012, and I was on Mancow's show this morning, and during a break, he's like, man, what's going on with your voice?
[00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:18.651]  Is it getting even deeper?
[00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:24.796]  Because I was on there with Jesse Ventura, and I'm like, no, my voice isn't getting deeper.
[00:09:26.553 --> 00:09:28.414]  I hope it doesn't or it won't have any voice.
[00:09:28.594 --> 00:09:33.016]  I yelled and screamed at the federal building here in Austin for about 30 minutes.
[00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:38.798]  It had a big confrontation yesterday and we were out until about 6.30 at night working on that.
[00:09:38.838 --> 00:09:42.520]  We're trying to download the footage right now and not really edit it.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.982]  Cut it down some, because it's 30 minutes long or more, so we can get it on the radio.
[00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:49.843]  It'll probably be on the nightly news tonight.
[00:09:49.903 --> 00:09:51.064]  If not, it'll be on the radio tomorrow.
[00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:53.565]  But that is pretty powerful stuff.
[00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:54.766]  And why do we go down to the federal building?
[00:09:55.326 --> 00:10:00.629]  They told one of my photographers that she would go to jail for photography of the federal building.
[00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:01.709]  And we all know that's not true.
[00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:02.570]  We know it's a fraud.
[00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.351]  Well, at least inform people do.
[00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.431]  The Supreme Court just ruled last week you can't do that.
[00:10:08.452 --> 00:10:09.732]  They keep arresting people, though.
[00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:15.976]  Illinois State Court just ruled that it's illegal to arrest people for filming the police in public or government buildings.
[00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:18.137]  The NSA has lost lawsuits over it.
[00:10:18.157 --> 00:10:18.997]  I mean, think about it.
[00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:22.519]  The NSA is spying on you without warrants, on record now.
[00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:23.980]  Every time they do it, it's a felony.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.001]  Government doesn't care.
[00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:25.581]  They're just doing it.
[00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.003]  The President says the military is now under NATO, UN command.
[00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:31.004]  Congress can just sit down and shut up.
[00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.666]  In public letters, statements, and three different congressional hearings.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:42.042]  Uh, belligerence by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrogance towards Congress, and Congress is a bunch of criminals.
[00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:50.945]  But they are the, that is the rightful body that represents the people on legislative matters and on the power of the purse and declaration of war.
[00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:57.407]  My point is, is that you're in a lot of trouble, folks, when the feds and the local police tell you you can't videotape them.
[00:10:58.287 --> 00:10:59.568]  And it happens all the time.
[00:11:00.523 --> 00:11:05.377]  You know, I see videos every week where a cop pulls somebody over, they go, is that a camera you've got taping me?
[00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:06.520]  You're going to jail.
[00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:07.784]  That's illegal.
[00:11:09.437 --> 00:11:10.518]  And they try different things.
[00:11:10.558 --> 00:11:13.060]  They say obstruction of a police officer's duty.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.001]  They say interfering with a police officer.
[00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:18.163]  Obstruction of justice.
[00:11:18.703 --> 00:11:19.604]  Wiretapping.
[00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:21.665]  And they know full well it's a fraud.
[00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:23.026]  And let me tell you something.
[00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:28.829]  When you misappropriate a law and twist it and put that into the court systems, that's official oppression.
[00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:30.390]  It's a civil rights violation.
[00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.351]  It's a violation of the Constitution.
[00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.612]  It's a violation of your oath.
[00:11:34.212 --> 00:11:36.014]  And it is beyond despicable.
[00:11:36.934 --> 00:11:41.516]  Let me tell you, the foreign banks that run this country are trying to convert this nation over to a North Korea-style system.
[00:11:41.957 --> 00:11:49.300]  Because they've stolen all the wealth, they've set up the police state, and they're all going to go to jail when this thing comes down.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:12:02.207]  It's designed to come down and make us all poor third-world slaves with the mega-elite living in armored, gated, rural communities and central scientific government hubs in major mega-cities.
[00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:05.369]  And that's the stated plan of Agenda 21.
[00:12:07.703 --> 00:12:09.185]  And they're doing it.
[00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:13.731]  And so all of you that serve the system need to know.
[00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:17.468]  That you are destroying yourselves.
[00:12:17.568 --> 00:12:19.068]  It's called killing yourself to live.
[00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:29.952]  And the globalists want to get us to a point where we're so bankrupt, so de-industrialized, where our farming communities and our agrarian system is so defunct that we're absolutely dependent on them.
[00:12:30.212 --> 00:12:32.773]  They've doubled the number of food stamps the last three and a half years.
[00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.013]  It's set to double again.
[00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:39.455]  You've got over 100 million people totally dependent on the government, one form or another.
[00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:43.776]  This is the process of going into bondage right now.
[00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:51.772]  And it's going to get horrible, but everyone needs to just speak out and point out this is premeditated.
[00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:56.376]  And yeah, it's not fun to go confront the feds and even go into the building.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.884]  That's right, they opened the gate up and brought us in.
[00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:07.346]  And what a story this is.
[00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:09.388]  It was the security guards, we're listeners,
[00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:13.389]  And the head security guard, after they finally came out, said, no, you got a right to filming.
[00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:14.810]  Hey, you want to go file a complaint?
[00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.431]  Opens the gate up and we go in there.
[00:13:17.772 --> 00:13:21.774]  And the federal police that were hiding inside went completely ape.
[00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:27.318]  The wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:13:27.818 --> 00:13:28.618]  I gotta tell you.
[00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:35.382]  I mean, you guys came out to a little lady and said you'd throw her in jail and that she looked shady and could be a terrorist and all the rest of it.
[00:13:35.803 --> 00:13:39.085]  And so we went down there, I mean, and just said, look, this isn't North Korea.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.067]  I mean, you know, you have a five foot four or five little blonde.
[00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.575]  You guys are telling her she's going to go to jail and freak her all out that she's a terrorist.
[00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:51.316]  I mean, just come on.
[00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:52.557]  Is that really what you want to be?
[00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:57.057]  You really want to play drama queen all day like there are real terrorists out there?
[00:13:57.077 --> 00:13:58.598]  Your bosses run the terrorists.
[00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:12.805]  FBI Deputy Director O'Neill, John O'Neill, gave a London Telegraph interview and a few others saying the government was going to stage a terrorist attack or allow Al-Qaeda to do it to take our liberties and attack Afghanistan.
[00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.126]  I've made films about it.
[00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:14.766]  It's on record.
[00:14:14.806 --> 00:14:17.048]  Any journalist listening can pull that up.
[00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:20.469]  And he still wasn't that smart, though.
[00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:25.271]  He's a smart guy and a patriot, showing the whole federal government's not criminals, but at the very top they are.
[00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:27.512]  It's the folks that ran Fast and Furious and others like that.
[00:14:28.292 --> 00:14:32.734]  And he got given the contract that ended September 10th.
[00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:36.075]  His first day on the job was September 11th.
[00:14:38.496 --> 00:14:40.077]  This is like New York Times, folks.
[00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:40.937]  You can go look this up.
[00:14:42.588 --> 00:14:43.769]  Guess who had the contract?
[00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:49.112]  Marvin Bush had the contract and said he was in the attack on the subway when it happened.
[00:14:49.412 --> 00:14:50.493]  It was so interesting.
[00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:52.094]  That was actually an AP interview.
[00:14:52.114 --> 00:14:52.574]  You can look it up.
[00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.575]  It was also Leningradian.
[00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:56.857]  It was so interesting that he was in the subway.
[00:14:56.917 --> 00:15:02.541]  He cleaned his stuff out that morning, handed it over to O'Neal at about 8.30 in the morning and left.
[00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:05.208]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.149]  You cannot make that type of stuff up.
[00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.770]  You cannot.
[00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.831]  And if you're a new listener, folks, you can just search what I just said.
[00:15:14.171 --> 00:15:15.952]  Marvin Bush, head of World Trade Center Security.
[00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:17.453]  Or John O'Neill.
[00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:22.135]  Deputy FBI director, head of counterterrorism, dead in the towers.
[00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.976]  Cover in New Yorker Magazine even covered it.
[00:15:25.456 --> 00:15:26.516]  And said, isn't it interesting?
[00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:27.577]  Isn't it a coincidence?
[00:15:28.257 --> 00:15:30.058]  Isn't it a coincidence that the Bushes
[00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:38.064]  Former President Bush was meeting at the Carlyle Group private shareholder meeting in D.C.
[00:15:38.685 --> 00:15:44.270]  a mile or two from the Pentagon when it got hit at the Bin Laden table.
[00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.412]  They even like to tell you that.
[00:15:45.732 --> 00:15:49.936]  Oh, he was at the Bin Laden table with Sheikh Bin Laden, the head of the family.
[00:15:52.694 --> 00:15:52.874]  I don't
[00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:08.214]  We're good to go.
[00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:44.850]  Sports, or watching action-adventure movies that are just ridiculous, where special forces are like Superman.
[00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.011]  It's not real, folks.
[00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:50.175]  If you weren't living in the fake projection reality,
[00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:52.832]  And have you studied the real reality?
[00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:57.196]  Read all the CFR, New World Order stuff, where they communicate like we don't even exist.
[00:16:57.436 --> 00:17:07.885]  They write books about how they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and laugh at us, how they're putting sodium fluoride in the water, how they're dumbing us down, what they're going to do, how they're going to turn the power plants off, how they're only going to shut off U.S.
[00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:13.130]  energy, and now they've got all the colleges getting ready to move and shut down the energy sector.
[00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:14.991]  And what an idiot you are.
[00:17:16.072 --> 00:17:27.155]  And I'm sitting here going, man, there's like hundreds of books, I've read them all, by all these world leaders, how they're setting up this German Chancellor, this British Prime Minister, this head of Harvard, this science czar.
[00:17:27.996 --> 00:17:31.297]  And I'm sitting here while they just, and I watch everything they say they do.
[00:17:31.777 --> 00:17:33.197]  I read stuff they wrote 100 years ago.
[00:17:33.577 --> 00:17:34.217]  They've done it all.
[00:17:34.798 --> 00:17:37.558]  I read stuff they wrote 50 years ago, they've done 70% of it.
[00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:41.440]  I read stuff they said 10 years ago, they've already implemented 30-40% of it.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.700]  I mean, they're doing it.
[00:17:43.652 --> 00:17:45.733]  And when they don't succeed, they try, try again.
[00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:50.195]  And we've got them held back 7, 8, 9, 10 years, depending on which actuary you look at.
[00:17:50.435 --> 00:17:52.296]  And the globalists give prospectus reports on that.
[00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:58.439]  Their war against humanity, their war against the family, the war against... Have you turned on the sitcoms, the dramas, the movies?
[00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:10.564]  Every message is fathers are scum, fathers are trash, fathers are rubes, fathers are schmucks, fathers are suckers, they're lazy, they're scum, they're trash, the single mother's the boss.
[00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:18.547]  And then I go out and I see these single mother women march up and just walk in front of your car and order you to stop, walk up to you in a store, tell you you got too many kids.
[00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:21.789]  They're just, yes, man, boy, they're in... Programmed!
[00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:24.870]  House slaves of the New World Order.
[00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.318]  Oh, you don't think they just had black women who were house slaves.
[00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:30.299]  That comes from Rome.
[00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.720]  You bring the women in the house, keep the men out there.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.641]  You beat them and you torture them and you don't let them learn how to talk.
[00:18:38.882 --> 00:18:43.004]  You take the women and you set them up as the bosses, and boy, they're going to carry it out.
[00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:46.646]  We're following a 2,000-year-old Roman slave manual.
[00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:47.526]  Literally.
[00:18:48.107 --> 00:18:50.728]  They've got university studies on that, I've discovered from the 70s.
[00:18:52.363 --> 00:19:03.524]  Did you know the slave manuals in the Americas from the Caribbean sugarcane fields to the cotton fields of Georgia were re-translated Roman slave manuals from Latin?
[00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:07.057]  Better learn about the real world.
[00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:08.937]  See, I know about slave manuals.
[00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:13.919]  I don't know about your stupid football and a bunch of roid heads on cocaine running around killing each other.
[00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:15.600]  I could care less about that.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:22.242]  I've been around some of these professional athletes and they are so arrogant and on power trips really believing they're rock stars.
[00:19:23.499 --> 00:19:25.242]  In a false paradigm, you're nobody.
[00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:27.665]  If you were king of a dream, what would that mean?
[00:19:27.885 --> 00:19:29.908]  If you were the king of a fantasy, what would that mean?
[00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:36.819]  And I've got trouble dealing with their false reality because it is the reality for most people, and as I more and more don't care about it.
[00:19:39.315 --> 00:19:43.476]  I don't even care about combing my hair or putting makeup on this zit I've got on my head right now.
[00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:46.537]  All I care about is getting through to your brain and waking you up.
[00:19:46.977 --> 00:20:03.181]  Now the scumbag, technocratic, wannabe control freak, Bob Costas has told you gun owners to go to Hades and he's come out and doubled and tripled down against the Second Amendment because he's got globalist backing and more mainstream news admits our government runs Al Qaeda.
[00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:05.422]  It's all coming up today in your phone calls.
[00:20:07.662 --> 00:20:12.488]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:13.169 --> 00:20:15.913]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.676]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.620]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:25.025]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:30.070]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.753]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.

[00:24:27.748 --> 00:24:29.269]  I mentioned this report yesterday.
[00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:45.974]  Al-Qaeda link grouped Syrian rebels once denied now key to anti-Assad victories and it goes on to admit that it's real Al-Qaeda and they say that they are going to attack America with missiles that they've been given by America after they bring down Assad.
[00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:47.175]  And that's part of the plan.
[00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:48.375]  They'll be let in.
[00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:49.836]  They'll blow up aircraft.
[00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:56.342]  And the TSA will show up on highways everywhere and grope your wife and beat the living daylights out of you and drag you to a FEMA camp.
[00:24:56.803 --> 00:24:57.624]  That's the next phase.
[00:24:57.664 --> 00:24:59.786]  I told you ten years ago they'd be on the highways everywhere.
[00:25:00.407 --> 00:25:02.209]  Told you they'd be in the malls, because they said they would.
[00:25:02.629 --> 00:25:04.311]  So I'm not just saying this is going to happen.
[00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:05.252]  I really believe it.
[00:25:05.632 --> 00:25:12.800]  If I say something and it's not satire, which I'll tell you when it's satire occasionally, I mean, I really am saying this is going to happen, okay?
[00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:15.810]  But let's get into Bob Costas here.
[00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.451]  Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks.
[00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:22.973]  That's out of Market Watch and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:26.894]  He says that he will not back off.
[00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:32.697]  And boy, we have a clip of him on NBC that is about 7-8 minutes long.
[00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:34.077]  We're going to play some excerpts.
[00:25:34.218 --> 00:25:36.719]  It is unbelievable.
[00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:39.240]  See, he's got the backing of the NFL and NBC.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.843]  And he says, you know, we shouldn't be anti-gun during the NFL.
[00:25:42.883 --> 00:25:43.563]  We understand.
[00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:47.027]  Because like 80% of NFL players, we estimate, are probably gun owners.
[00:25:48.908 --> 00:25:53.312]  And he goes on, Costas doesn't back down from gun comments.
[00:25:53.372 --> 00:25:53.793]  That's right.
[00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:54.814]  Blame the Second Amendment.
[00:25:55.996 --> 00:25:59.338]  Not the thug culture in the NFL, not the spoiled brat steroid culture.
[00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:06.483]  I mean, I look at that guy, he looks like he has the chin of somebody who's taken gallons of growth hormone.
[00:26:06.924 --> 00:26:08.545]  Oh, but I bet we'll never hear the autopsy.
[00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:10.706]  Guaranteed, he was seeing a psychologist.
[00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:13.248]  They said he was on painkillers and other prescription drugs.
[00:26:13.368 --> 00:26:16.771]  Guaranteed on serotonin, reuptake inhibitor, Prozac class.
[00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:18.112]  They always are.
[00:26:18.132 --> 00:26:19.713]  It always comes out later, a year later.
[00:26:20.613 --> 00:26:22.253]  So he fires back at his critics.
[00:26:22.273 --> 00:26:37.117]  We're going to be playing a disgusting clip of that in a moment, and then an amazing video I saw from a YouTube channel, Mr. Colin Knorr, and it's a Bob Costas gun control speech response.
[00:26:37.317 --> 00:26:38.597]  One minute, 32 seconds.
[00:26:38.977 --> 00:26:39.618]  Very eloquent.
[00:26:39.658 --> 00:26:40.978]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:41.578 --> 00:26:48.900]  But right now, first off, he says it's disproportionate that 65 out of 80 Colts players he talked to own guns.
[00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:52.262]  Number one, that's about the national average.
[00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:55.164]  It's a little over 60% in the country own guns, punk.
[00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:57.646]  I say 150 million gun owners.
[00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:59.468]  That was a number five, six years ago.
[00:26:59.488 --> 00:27:05.553]  It's more like 170 million people own guns, okay?
[00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:08.555]  Most households have firearms.
[00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:09.396]  It's closer to 70%.
[00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:15.841]  And they have Justice Department numbers that say it's over 55, but our intel is a lot of folks just are quiet about it.
[00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:24.498]  Now, rich people or wealthy high-profile folks, they've pretty much all got guns or they've got bodyguards.
[00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:32.066]  If you don't have guns and you are known to have tens of millions of dollars, you better have guns or you're going to be robbed.
[00:27:32.086 --> 00:27:32.687]  Okay?
[00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:34.106]  I don't know.
[00:27:56.502 --> 00:27:59.404]  I mean, how many military we have that have guns at 18, much less 25?
[00:27:59.924 --> 00:28:01.685]  How many police are 25 years old?
[00:28:01.825 --> 00:28:02.245]  A lot.
[00:28:02.785 --> 00:28:03.946]  Oh, you're going to have trouble?
[00:28:04.146 --> 00:28:05.347]  You're going to have trouble, period.
[00:28:05.587 --> 00:28:09.549]  So don't you take my rights, because there's people that have bad behavior out there.
[00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.770]  That's how the Soviet Union worked.
[00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.513]  If somebody on your street did something bad, they'd randomly shoot three or four people.
[00:28:16.553 --> 00:28:18.374]  The Nazis did that too in occupied areas.
[00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:20.996]  You shot an SS officer, they'd kill 100 people.
[00:28:21.496 --> 00:28:23.117]  Shot a regular German soldier, they'd kill 10.
[00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:31.732]  Somebody on the street killed somebody, they would burn the whole street down or bring in bulldozers.
[00:28:33.613 --> 00:28:34.793]  And that's how this works.
[00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:36.194]  This is pure authoritarianism.
[00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:38.034]  Oh, there's criminals with guns.
[00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:38.855]  We're going to take yours.
[00:28:38.895 --> 00:28:39.355]  How's that sound?
[00:28:41.183 --> 00:28:44.885]  Let's just go to break so we have a long segment to play this to come back and analyze this cost us clip.
[00:28:45.805 --> 00:28:56.931]  He said, even if all those guns were obtained legally, you can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s, aggressive young men, subject to impulses without something bad happening.
[00:28:57.632 --> 00:28:57.872]  Really?
[00:28:58.212 --> 00:29:00.773]  I've been super aggressive my whole life and you've had guns everywhere.
[00:29:00.933 --> 00:29:01.514]  Never thought.
[00:29:02.214 --> 00:29:05.898]  I was arguing with my girlfriend or my wife, and I had girlfriends before my wife.
[00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:09.141]  My experience is it's usually women that start punching you or whatever.
[00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:11.663]  You know, if there's an argument or you say you're leaving them.
[00:29:11.723 --> 00:29:16.207]  I mean, we've all been through this and slap and they hit you or they throw something at you.
[00:29:16.628 --> 00:29:22.613]  I mean, I never thought about I just like I'm out of here or if they're jumping on you, slam them down on the bed, you know, and say, stop it.
[00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:27.118]  But the point is that that I would never think of that.
[00:29:28.786 --> 00:29:34.750]  What has people have breaks is steroids and pain pills and antidepressants.
[00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.614]  I mean, I look at those NFL guys when they're out there playing and they look like space aliens.
[00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:41.595]  White, black, hispanic, you name it, doesn't matter.
[00:29:41.775 --> 00:29:42.916]  They look totally screwed up.
[00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:50.001]  They're obviously on steroids and growth hormone and a bunch of other exotic stuff out of their minds.
[00:29:50.361 --> 00:29:52.943]  You know that mother on Prozac ground her little children?
[00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.164]  Do we get to ban bathtubs?
[00:29:55.612 --> 00:29:58.600]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.543 --> 00:30:02.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.983]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[00:30:12.283 --> 00:30:19.366]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:22.108]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:28.451]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:31.874]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[00:30:32.154 --> 00:30:38.801]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system from my research to protect you and your family.
[00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:44.127]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[00:30:44.347 --> 00:30:50.013]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[00:30:50.373 --> 00:30:52.417]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[00:30:52.677 --> 00:30:53.238]  ProPure.
[00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:59.388]  Go to InfowarStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[00:30:59.408 --> 00:31:01.732]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfowarStore.com.
[00:31:08.271 --> 00:31:15.937]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:31:16.377 --> 00:31:20.000]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:08.496]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:08.777 --> 00:32:10.478]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:32:10.758 --> 00:32:14.081]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:16.463]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:32:16.603 --> 00:32:20.026]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:32:20.227 --> 00:32:26.052]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:29.695]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:34.620]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.486]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:32:40.747 --> 00:32:41.788]  And here's the best news.
[00:32:42.028 --> 00:32:44.911]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:48.973]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.

[00:33:03.238 --> 00:33:04.739]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:33:31.775 --> 00:33:33.596]  Monday through Friday, we're here.
[00:33:34.356 --> 00:33:35.477]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:38.538]  You have found at the front lines of the info war.
[00:33:39.439 --> 00:33:46.242]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation of the globalists, trying to rally patriots worldwide.
[00:33:47.302 --> 00:34:02.006]  Coming up after I get into Bob Costas and his savage demonization of the Second Amendment and the fact that he now has doubled and tripled down, we're going to play that video and audio here in a moment, and then get into a powerful short response that I saw posted on YouTube.
[00:34:02.906 --> 00:34:08.287]  And before we get into all the other geopolitical news, I'm going to cover a lot of news this hour, then open phones the next two hours as well as news.
[00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:11.748]  I was just, I saw the news report
[00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:21.073]  I read it and then during the break I watched it out of Chicago and when I opened the phones up I want to hear from folks in Chicago specifically.
[00:34:21.093 --> 00:34:23.735]  Now this guy had a sweet little bull terrier puppy.
[00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:27.377]  The police came to the guy's house to give him a ticket.
[00:34:28.178 --> 00:34:29.439]  The dog walked out.
[00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:31.040]  They just walked out.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.600]  Didn't growl.
[00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:33.101]  Wagging his tail.
[00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:37.084]  I've seen videos like this where a lab gets out of a car wagging its tail and the cop shoots it.
[00:34:37.584 --> 00:34:41.247]  I mean obviously if it's a big mean dog running up growling I could see you shooting him.
[00:34:41.267 --> 00:34:41.867]  In fact I would.
[00:34:44.335 --> 00:34:46.397]  All the time, little dogs, or a lab.
[00:34:46.417 --> 00:35:03.331]  There's that famous video where they're, you know, giving the guy a ticket, the cop's searching the car, the golden lab jumps out and is clearly wagging its tail and, you know, the dog wants to go running around hunting or something, and I mean labs don't, or the sweetest dogs around, and the cop just kills it.
[00:35:04.752 --> 00:35:11.838]  And I see this all the time, but what's amazing is the Chicago police came back and got in the guy's face
[00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.552]  And said, you shouldn't have called the media.
[00:35:16.273 --> 00:35:19.794]  And this is like a well-spoken, you know, fella, too, on top of it.
[00:35:19.814 --> 00:35:23.837]  I mean, it's bad enough when the police are oppressing thugs because they think they can get away with it.
[00:35:25.097 --> 00:35:26.318]  This is what happened to our reporter.
[00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:28.239]  She's downtown taking photos last week.
[00:35:28.999 --> 00:35:31.581]  Doesn't even know it's a federal building right there because it's not marked.
[00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:33.242]  Down by the Capitol.
[00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:34.343]  She's taking photos of the Capitol.
[00:35:34.983 --> 00:35:42.549]  And all of a sudden, the guy comes out with a badge and a suit and a tie, you know, dressed like men in black, and says, you look shady.
[00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:43.390]  You could be a terrorist.
[00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.290]  I could arrest you.
[00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.692]  I could arrest you for, you know, for terrorism.
[00:35:46.712 --> 00:35:48.814]  It's illegal to photograph a federal building.
[00:35:48.854 --> 00:35:51.316]  And she came back freaked out, and I said, it is not illegal, Molly.
[00:35:52.455 --> 00:35:53.996]  Holly Rogers, and I said, let me go show you.
[00:35:54.016 --> 00:35:56.598]  They just had a Supreme Court ruling a few days ago, and I showed her that.
[00:35:57.258 --> 00:36:01.921]  And she said, wow, I can't believe they'd say it's illegal that I could go to jail, and it's not.
[00:36:02.021 --> 00:36:03.142]  And I'm going, yeah, I know.
[00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:04.103]  That's scary, isn't it?
[00:36:04.123 --> 00:36:05.744]  It's a dangerous government.
[00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:07.465]  This is a mafia gangster government.
[00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:17.436]  A lot of police departments aren't like that because they come from areas that support and protect the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:36:17.736 --> 00:36:18.737]  They've had good leadership.
[00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.719]  You normally either have a good history in a department or a bad history.
[00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:25.241]  Well, Chicago is famous for a very corrupt police.
[00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.602]  That's not debated.
[00:36:27.362 --> 00:36:28.583]  Same thing with New York City.
[00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:30.004]  We've had Serpico on many times.
[00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:33.086]  And just to come to somebody's house
[00:36:34.204 --> 00:36:37.945]  And do that is amazing, so we're going to play that newscast and analyze it.
[00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:45.068]  In fact, guys, I have the local news printout on that, but will you print me that particular newscast printout so I can plug the station and the rest of it?
[00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:47.449]  Thank you, because that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:36:47.469 --> 00:36:50.730]  I'm going to get into the Bob Costa situation here in a moment.
[00:36:51.230 --> 00:37:02.654]  You know I print over 110,000 of InfoWars magazines, and what happened is the magazines we held back sold out in one day.
[00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.651]  More than 30,000 held back, sold out.
[00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:15.576]  And it usually takes, the three different distributors we have, from Austin to San Antonio, usually takes them about four days to distribute 70,000.
[00:37:16.296 --> 00:37:19.277]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:23.340]  And Color Glossy Magazine, it's an outreach we do.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.100]  Free.
[00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:33.365]  That's why we sell them at cost to you, so you can give them to people, but we gotta pay the shipping and, you know, for the printing and all that, and the graphics and the rest of it, and the reports.
[00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:35.050]  Money goes into it.
[00:37:56.922 --> 00:38:03.649]  $50,000 on the street and having close to $50,000 actually sold, that's good.
[00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:10.715]  Now you can get these in bulk from $10 up to $100 at cost at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:19.083]  And then we held back $3,000 or $4,000 so that any added subscriptions for the month, you'll also get it with a 12-month subscription.
[00:38:20.004 --> 00:38:21.865]  It's also available, great way to wake people up.
[00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:37.176]  But this is the, this man wants your guns issue with Barack Obama on the cover and gets into the next four years and the globalist agenda from shutting down our power plants to bankrupting the economy to how they say they're going to come after our guns outside of law through executive orders and regulations.
[00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:43.059]  And it is so important to get out to everyone you know of the magazine available at infowarestore.com.
[00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:49.964]  And the way they're going, first day we were selling like $15,000 a day, then it went down to about $10,000 a day, and then now it's like $5,000 a day.
[00:38:50.484 --> 00:38:52.185]  We've got less than $10,000 right now.
[00:38:52.265 --> 00:38:54.246]  They will go very, very quickly.
[00:38:54.266 --> 00:38:55.767]  Because I walked back there and said, so we sold out.
[00:38:55.787 --> 00:38:56.308]  And he goes, well...
[00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.611]  One of the courier places delivered a whole bunch yesterday.
[00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:03.713]  I guess they hadn't delivered them when we said bring back whatever's left, so we got back more than we wanted.
[00:39:03.913 --> 00:39:04.873]  But this will be it.
[00:39:05.013 --> 00:39:09.756]  They will go, and if you want the one-year subscription, get that as well, or buy them in bulk at cost.
[00:39:10.276 --> 00:39:10.536]  Okay.
[00:39:11.755 --> 00:39:12.956]  Our first issue sold out.
[00:39:13.216 --> 00:39:16.118]  Our fourth issue is selling out.
[00:39:16.198 --> 00:39:17.039]  The other two didn't.
[00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:18.439]  There's a few back issues of those.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.043]  When you get a subscription while supplies last, you also get some of the back issues when the first one comes.
[00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:27.886]  And lastly, on that issue, it will end December 10th.
[00:39:27.986 --> 00:39:35.271]  We are the biggest seller of Pro-Pure stainless steel, gravity-fed, highest quality, top of the line, destroys the competition in side-by-side comparisons.
[00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:37.832]  We have all those comparisons at Infowarstore.com.
[00:39:38.173 --> 00:39:40.774]  Stainless steel spigot, not BPA.
[00:39:42.095 --> 00:39:43.516]  No plastic, that's why it's so great.
[00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:50.642]  There's some good plastics out there, but the point is this is stainless steel, burnished, and lower price than the plastic ones that are out there.
[00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:51.622]  That's what's amazing about it.
[00:39:51.642 --> 00:39:55.465]  It's what I use, and they're 15% off of the promo code WATER15.
[00:39:55.565 --> 00:40:00.149]  And you can't forget it because it's right there on InfowarsStore.com or InfowarsShop.com.
[00:40:00.169 --> 00:40:04.572]  We'll take you to the same place or call 888-253-3139.
[00:40:05.673 --> 00:40:10.616]  We have the supplies to go out past December 10th with that price, but we want to make sure
[00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:18.262]  That even if you want it delivered to you as snail mail or not UPS or FedEx, you have those choices that it'll get to you before Christmas.
[00:40:18.302 --> 00:40:19.182]  Great gift to give.
[00:40:19.703 --> 00:40:21.183]  I like the ProPure Traveler.
[00:40:21.704 --> 00:40:24.305]  It's not much smaller than the big ones and it's a lot less.
[00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:28.347]  All up there, the lowest price, InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.251]  Christmas shopping, again, can be over.
[00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:38.912]  You can give them gift subscriptions or give them stocking stuffers, buying the magazines in bulk.
[00:40:38.932 --> 00:40:45.954]  You can give them InfoWarsNews.com, memberships to see the nightly news, the daily radio show, all my films, a bunch of other films.
[00:40:46.414 --> 00:40:52.956]  One membership is 10 memberships, $5.95 a month, or get a yearly membership and get 5.3 months free off the price.
[00:40:53.336 --> 00:40:56.257]  You just pay for 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months free.
[00:40:56.277 --> 00:40:57.957]  That's what the special comes out to.
[00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:00.638]  They have that, but also you can just buy a month to month.
[00:41:01.338 --> 00:41:15.202]  And give it as e-cards to your friends, the username, passcode, and say, here is your InfoWarsNews.com, underground, you know, patriot information site, forbidden info, and they'll go and put in the username, passcode, and check it out.
[00:41:16.482 --> 00:41:20.604]  Again, if you just joined us, and I sound more raspy than usual, I think I'm kind of working it out here.
[00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:25.445]  I went and screamed at the Federal Building, as I said, because they told our reporter they can't take photographs in America.
[00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:28.706]  And so I went and screamed at them for a while, and then
[00:41:30.845 --> 00:41:33.926]  Security guards came out and said, hey, we're listeners of the show.
[00:41:33.946 --> 00:41:37.288]  You have a right to go file a complaint here at the gate.
[00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:39.208]  I said, you're going to get in trouble.
[00:41:39.228 --> 00:41:40.649]  And he goes, nope, it's my job.
[00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:42.369]  It's your right to go in there and file a complaint.
[00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.051]  So I went in there and he's like entering a beehive.
[00:41:48.911 --> 00:41:51.753]  Anyways, but they're not all bad guys.
[00:41:51.813 --> 00:41:57.698]  I mean, it's federal marshals, well, one federal marshal that sent me a bunch of unclassified stuff.
[00:41:57.738 --> 00:42:00.280]  It wasn't restricted, but not for the general public.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.621]  You know, the MIAC, Homeland Security Report, stuff like that.
[00:42:02.641 --> 00:42:07.865]  That was state police with the MIAC report, where they say veterans are the number one terror group and gun owners are evil.
[00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.027]  All this other traitorous stuff.
[00:42:10.707 --> 00:42:13.748]  Okay, speaking of gun owners are evil.
[00:42:14.408 --> 00:42:14.908]  Here it is.
[00:42:14.988 --> 00:42:17.710]  Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks.
[00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:18.950]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.971]  Here is the Daily Herald.
[00:42:21.031 --> 00:42:23.932]  Costas doesn't back down from gun agenda comments.
[00:42:24.372 --> 00:42:26.393]  Bob Costas fires back at his critics.
[00:42:27.634 --> 00:42:29.114]  It's just totally disgusting.
[00:42:30.275 --> 00:42:32.816]  And he doubled and tripled down, blaming the Second Amendment.
[00:42:33.216 --> 00:42:35.817]  And basically said men can't be trusted with guns.
[00:42:37.475 --> 00:42:43.696]  And really the implication is, because most NFL athletes are black, is that blacks can't be trusted with guns.
[00:42:44.796 --> 00:42:58.019]  And then you've got, I mean that's really what he's saying, and then you've got the, you've got the black sports writer for Fox Sports saying the KKK wants guns legal so blacks kill themselves.
[00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:01.860]  And he's saying blacks can't own guns.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.500]  I mean these people
[00:43:03.516 --> 00:43:08.962]  Or acting like black people are just, you know, just can't be trusted with anything.
[00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:11.986]  And that's the attitude of the left.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.681]  We're going to put you in compact cities.
[00:43:14.701 --> 00:43:15.902]  We're going to break up your families.
[00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:18.684]  We're going to pay the women for 50 years, not have men in the house.
[00:43:19.024 --> 00:43:21.646]  We're going to wonder why you go from 11% illegitimacy to over 90%.
[00:43:21.746 --> 00:43:26.970]  We're going to wonder why more than 10% of the black population is in prison.
[00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:30.493]  And what is it, close to 90% have felony records.
[00:43:30.573 --> 00:43:32.174]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:43:32.394 --> 00:43:37.518]  And then you send them, it's happened to white kids, Hispanic as well, to the colleges of crime.
[00:43:38.632 --> 00:43:40.597]  Where that's, it's like hunting.
[00:43:40.637 --> 00:43:43.244]  It's like Comanche Indians raiding other Indians.
[00:43:43.285 --> 00:43:46.493]  That's the, you know, the manly thing is to go out and rob liquor stores.
[00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:50.167]  And the rap music put out by MTV.
[00:43:50.187 --> 00:43:51.969]  I mean, I've talked to high-level folks at MTV.
[00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:52.829]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:43:53.009 --> 00:43:53.750]  Boy, this is big.
[00:43:54.811 --> 00:44:00.494]  In 1996 or so, and they're telling people, we're now going to put out gangster death rap, cop killer rap.
[00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:05.598]  We're going to kill rock and roll and all the rest of the music because this is the message that the establishment wants.
[00:44:05.638 --> 00:44:09.540]  They force-fed that to destroy the entire culture.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.482]  A lot of people say, oh, good.
[00:44:11.522 --> 00:44:12.042]  I'm racist.
[00:44:12.062 --> 00:44:12.943]  Destroy the black people.
[00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.003]  Sell the drugs in their neighborhood.
[00:44:14.324 --> 00:44:17.306]  It's like the Godfather line, which is very accurate about
[00:44:18.426 --> 00:44:21.829]  I don't want it sold to kids, keep it with the colored people.
[00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.932]  They're animals anyways, let them lose their souls.
[00:44:26.252 --> 00:44:29.234]  That is the racist attitude that's going on.
[00:44:29.254 --> 00:44:35.419]  But folks, that's a no pun intended black hole to suck everyone into it.
[00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:38.170]  Okay, that is what it is.
[00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.691]  It's so dehumanizing.
[00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:43.114]  The globalists, people say, oh, kill them Arabs, just nuke their whole area.
[00:44:43.335 --> 00:44:45.777]  Good, I'm glad we've got Al-Qaeda over there killing them.
[00:44:45.817 --> 00:44:46.257]  I've heard that.
[00:44:46.678 --> 00:44:47.158]  So what?
[00:44:47.198 --> 00:44:48.219]  Just let them kill each other.
[00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:49.300]  Yeah, we're using Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.061]  Big deal, Alex.
[00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:52.643]  Well, they're using Al-Qaeda to take my rights, too.
[00:44:53.164 --> 00:44:58.229]  The globalists hate the American people because we have a history of liberty and fighting back more than anybody.
[00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:00.271]  They hate us a lot more than the Arabs.
[00:45:01.158 --> 00:45:03.859]  So you're like, hey, let the blacks die, kill each other.
[00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:06.239]  Hey, let the Arabs kill each other.
[00:45:06.279 --> 00:45:07.499]  Get, get, get, get, get.
[00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:09.660]  You know, Roscoe Pico train.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.180]  Hey, boss hog, get, get, get.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.421]  There's all these people that think they're part of the power structure who aren't.
[00:45:15.801 --> 00:45:18.622]  Look, you can't do bad stuff to other people and not have it come back on you.
[00:45:20.883 --> 00:45:21.143]  Okay?
[00:45:21.203 --> 00:45:22.643]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[00:45:23.695 --> 00:45:24.815]  And here's what's happening.
[00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:26.516]  There is a collective consciousness.
[00:45:26.536 --> 00:45:30.097]  There's a collective, it's been scientifically proven with computer breakdowns.
[00:45:30.697 --> 00:45:31.898]  Sixth Sense has been proven.
[00:45:31.918 --> 00:45:39.860]  They don't know really how it works, but it's the same way I believe fish and birds, and we're even more advanced, know when a tornado's coming, know when the cold front's coming to fly south.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.861]  It's why, it's been proven.
[00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:50.203]  Because that's why we used to go down to Ambergris Key in Belize, because we had friends that were microbiologists with government grants who lived on Ambergris Key.
[00:45:50.543 --> 00:45:52.144]  So my parents would go a lot more than I did.
[00:45:53.445 --> 00:46:14.878]  And they were studying lobsters and groupers and things, but it's now been proven, off that 30-year research, that lobsters, a half a day before a big storm hits, in the coral that beats them to death, that's how ancient natives knew that when a hurricane was coming, before the wind was even blowing, when it was blue skies, a half day, a day, sometimes two days before,
[00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:23.527]  The natives say, when the lobsters come out of their holes and walk out into the underwater sand dunes, a hurricane's coming.
[00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:38.202]  And it turns out all ancient cultures that lived in Pacific areas or tropical areas, in their own translations say, when the lobsters walk, or when the crabs leave their holes and go out into the deeper water.
[00:46:41.904 --> 00:46:42.685]  I mean, how do they know?
[00:46:42.705 --> 00:46:45.567]  The brain, folks, is an incredible computer.
[00:46:46.088 --> 00:46:53.074]  And it's been proven humans, that guys type in, you know, studies prove birds and fish, but it's also humans.
[00:46:53.194 --> 00:46:57.438]  Birds and fish have magnetic sensor cells.
[00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:00.722]  And they've proven humans have a sixth sense.
[00:47:00.742 --> 00:47:01.782]  You know when somebody's looking at you?
[00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:07.084]  I can't tell you how many times I've been on our family ranch that doesn't have a lot of poachers on it.
[00:47:07.384 --> 00:47:07.844]  It's big.
[00:47:08.084 --> 00:47:10.165]  We've had it since the 1830s.
[00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:24.910]  And I'm walking through Total Woods, you know, a mile from any people, and I'm walking in the woods and I feel somebody looking at me, and I feel it, and I walk through a glade through an opening and somebody's like, oh, am I not supposed to be over here?
[00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.491]  And a guy's up in a tree stand.
[00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:32.108]  Well, I mean, you know, the guy had a rifle out and was sitting there like an idiot.
[00:47:32.168 --> 00:47:33.589]  I mean, look at that guy with the scope.
[00:47:33.889 --> 00:47:35.910]  I felt those crosshairs on the back of my head.
[00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.651]  One time I was down in Waco protesting the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:47:40.671 --> 00:47:42.092]  We got that video somewhere around here.
[00:47:42.112 --> 00:47:43.032]  A little bit of it's on the internet.
[00:47:43.072 --> 00:47:44.213]  Mike Hansen's got the whole thing.
[00:47:44.253 --> 00:47:44.733]  I know he does.
[00:47:44.753 --> 00:47:46.414]  Mike, can you put that up on YouTube, please?
[00:47:47.234 --> 00:47:48.595]  I know folks listen.
[00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:50.295]  He has the Mike Hansen channel on YouTube.
[00:47:50.995 --> 00:47:53.536]  And there's like a parking garage 500 yards away.
[00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:56.759]  I just kept feeling something.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:03.045]  I'm protesting the Klan and they're saying, my second amendment means I have the right to kill this guy that later came out the guy was a Fed.
[00:48:03.065 --> 00:48:03.626]  I mean, I knew that.
[00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:08.010]  That's what it demonized the Second Amendment is have the Klan go around and promote it when they're actually the ones that were against it.
[00:48:09.391 --> 00:48:10.192]  And I'm sitting there.
[00:48:12.093 --> 00:48:18.255]  And I just feel it, and I look up, and I couldn't even see it 500 yards in the parking garage, the cops with sniper rifles.
[00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:21.256]  I just walked towards it, and there were the cops.
[00:48:21.536 --> 00:48:25.877]  As I walked up, and Mike's with me, he's got, with the gun, on me.
[00:48:27.618 --> 00:48:31.759]  And I went over to the police, and I said something, and they said, get out of here, Jones.
[00:48:31.819 --> 00:48:34.060]  And it turned out, they knew the Klan were feds.
[00:48:35.302 --> 00:48:39.083]  And they had called the Klan out to support the Branch Davidians, who didn't want them.
[00:48:39.103 --> 00:48:42.844]  About half the Davidians were Hispanic or Black, just to demonize the Davidians.
[00:48:42.864 --> 00:48:46.426]  And the cops were all in on it, the Sheriff's Department, the McClellan County Sheriff's Department.
[00:48:46.486 --> 00:48:48.986]  I mean, that is the dirtiness of this country.
[00:48:50.267 --> 00:48:53.228]  That is how dirty, dirty, dirty.
[00:48:53.748 --> 00:48:59.890]  And I was looking, and the cops had their guns on us, the protesters, and not on the Klan.
[00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.452]  And I was wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans, but I looked like I had some backpack and was suspicious.
[00:49:05.712 --> 00:49:07.394]  They knew I was in McClellan County.
[00:49:07.454 --> 00:49:08.174]  That's the county, isn't it?
[00:49:08.474 --> 00:49:10.956]  We had just built a memorial church for all those that died there.
[00:49:13.778 --> 00:49:15.579]  That's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.441]  That's America.
[00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:19.602]  That's the kind of stuff that goes on.
[00:49:19.762 --> 00:49:21.804]  And I was getting off into this.
[00:49:21.824 --> 00:49:23.585]  The point is, there's a sixth sense.
[00:49:25.308 --> 00:49:34.873]  And collectively they've pumped the image through the media and the culture that we're animals, we're ugly, we're bad, we need to die, there needs to be a bioweapon release, the world's be better off without humans.
[00:49:35.353 --> 00:49:43.317]  They've sold that idea so that we collectively download that and decide we're failures so that we'll go out and be failures.
[00:49:45.629 --> 00:49:50.293]  And this isn't metaphysical, like it's some magic thing, like the secret, you say it'll happen, it will.
[00:49:50.934 --> 00:49:55.518]  You say it'll happen, you start believing it'll happen, you will take actions that will make it happen.
[00:49:55.858 --> 00:49:58.240]  Not, it just appears like a genie gave it to you.
[00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:02.544]  If it's possible, if it's... We're made the image of the creator of the universe, folks.
[00:50:02.584 --> 00:50:03.344]  We are creators.
[00:50:03.885 --> 00:50:04.906]  We're little creators.
[00:50:05.466 --> 00:50:06.267]  But look what we've built.
[00:50:08.953 --> 00:50:11.534]  And the devil and his fallen angels, they are not creators.
[00:50:11.574 --> 00:50:15.815]  They have to manipulate us to build things they want, and they want to play God.
[00:50:16.135 --> 00:50:19.136]  And even if you don't believe in all that, the elite believe in it, so they're manifesting that.
[00:50:20.836 --> 00:50:24.697]  You notice revelations are starting to unfold with the chips and the Big Brother and all the rest of it.
[00:50:24.917 --> 00:50:26.898]  And believe me, folks, you're not going to get raptured out of this.
[00:50:28.427 --> 00:50:29.148]  That's a distortion.
[00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:34.632]  And so you better make sure you get your soul right and on the right side of this because that's all that matters.
[00:50:34.672 --> 00:50:37.014]  No matter what happens to your body, folks, you're going to die anyways.
[00:50:37.355 --> 00:50:46.923]  You've got to step across the fear line into the empowerment area and realize that we all collectively are wishing for our own destruction right now.
[00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:48.945]  At some level, we all hate ourselves.
[00:50:49.525 --> 00:50:50.786]  Because we're not righteous.
[00:50:51.326 --> 00:50:52.466]  We have become degenerate.
[00:50:52.846 --> 00:50:55.948]  I'll get into Bob Costa speaking of degenerate.
[00:50:56.028 --> 00:51:01.130]  It is degenerate to blame law-abiding citizens for what a bunch of gang-banging drug addicts do.
[00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.271]  And we're going to talk about this demon and play these clips coming up.
[00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:04.711]  Stay with us.
[00:51:06.178 --> 00:51:15.145]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water anytime, anywhere, with absolutely no power whatsoever, then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:15.846]  Here's why.
[00:51:15.866 --> 00:51:22.051]  There's a brand new self-reliance product available that makes producing piping hot water in any emergency fast and easy.
[00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:25.013]  Introducing the Hot Water Rocket from Solutions from Science.

[00:51:30.257 --> 00:51:30.998]  Simply add water
[00:51:30.998 --> 00:51:31.398]  We're good to go!
[00:52:01.231 --> 00:52:10.313]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:52:10.973 --> 00:52:13.113]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:52:14.014 --> 00:52:22.356]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:52:22.976 --> 00:52:27.877]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:53:19.725 --> 00:53:20.125]  The difference?

[00:54:19.962 --> 00:54:21.203]  Ira hates me.
[00:54:23.439 --> 00:54:33.353]  Ira Hayes, call him Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore.
[00:54:33.433 --> 00:54:38.379]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:49.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to just have a jam-packed show today.
[00:54:50.315 --> 00:54:54.500]  We are going to release the White House footage of the Bin Laden raid.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.742]  And yes, it's satire.
[00:54:56.782 --> 00:54:58.203]  The Easter Bunny is involved.
[00:54:58.223 --> 00:54:59.444]  Total theater.
[00:54:59.464 --> 00:55:00.746]  Zero dark Easter Bunny.
[00:55:01.586 --> 00:55:05.690]  We're going to be premiering an audio video here that breaks down the fact that it's an admitted fraud.
[00:55:06.491 --> 00:55:08.252]  With Jakari Jackson and Melissa Melton.
[00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:15.818]  And we've got a bunch of other reports we're going to be premiering and I will give the phone number out starting in the next hour to get your take on all this.
[00:55:15.898 --> 00:55:18.160]  But Bob Costa says he's not apologizing.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.422]  He's sorry he used the NFL to do it.
[00:55:21.143 --> 00:55:24.045]  But now he's going to go grandstand and say, you know what?
[00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:26.787]  You don't have a right to own guns, okay?
[00:55:27.668 --> 00:55:31.591]  And of course that little scumbag you know has bodyguards and also has guns.
[00:55:32.779 --> 00:55:38.663]  And he's saying NFL players in their 20s and 30s are stupid and cannot be trusted.
[00:55:38.723 --> 00:55:39.924]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:51.311]  People in all the sports on our program on Sunday night said that one year when he coached the Colts he had 80 players before they cut the roster down 80 players in training camp.
[00:55:51.732 --> 00:55:59.797]  He said how many of you guys own a gun and roughly 65 hands went up even if all those guns were obtained legally.
[00:56:00.914 --> 00:56:09.700]  You can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s, aggressive young men, subject to impulses, without something bad happening.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:14.042]  And I posed this question, didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night, but I'll pose it here.
[00:56:14.983 --> 00:56:24.729]  Give me one example of an athlete, I know it's happened in society, but give me one example of a professional athlete, who by virtue of his having a gun,
[00:56:25.917 --> 00:56:42.844]  We need to go look that up because I've seen cases where people tried to rob professional athletes and they've protected themselves not just in football but in golf, basketball.
[00:56:43.084 --> 00:56:44.305]  I remember cases of that.
[00:56:44.725 --> 00:56:48.867]  So their idea is, of course the real FBI statistics are for every crime
[00:56:50.219 --> 00:56:55.204]  Where a gun is used, it's more than 14 times, some statistics are over 20, that it's used to frustrate crime.
[00:56:55.584 --> 00:56:57.566]  Everybody knows lower crime rates, more guns.
[00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.970]  It's so simple.
[00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.872]  You have less home invasions in areas.
[00:57:03.912 --> 00:57:06.115]  The less gun laws, the less home invasions.
[00:57:06.475 --> 00:57:08.197]  Kennesaw, Georgia made it the law.
[00:57:08.888 --> 00:57:10.309]  Decades ago, you had to own guns.
[00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:16.493]  The suburb of Atlanta, they had a crime wave and their crime dropped by 87% in one year.
[00:57:16.513 --> 00:57:18.014]  That's just department numbers.
[00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:18.755]  You can pull those up.
[00:57:19.095 --> 00:57:20.416]  There's been documentaries made about it.
[00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:24.216]  But this idea, and they go on from there.
[00:57:24.276 --> 00:57:25.677]  It goes on and on.
[00:57:25.717 --> 00:57:27.058]  It's like a seven, eight minute clip.
[00:57:27.779 --> 00:57:31.040]  We'll play some more of it coming up in the next hour, but I want to go to break with this clip.
[00:57:31.321 --> 00:57:35.183]  Bob Costas, gun control, speech response.
[00:57:35.563 --> 00:57:38.045]  This is from just a wise man on YouTube.
[00:57:38.065 --> 00:57:38.405]  Here it is.
[00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:41.767]  As far as I'm concerned, there is no current gun culture.
[00:57:42.127 --> 00:57:44.490]  America's gun culture began at its inception.
[00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:52.078]  America's gun culture will ensure more and more that the woman alone at home with her kid can protect herself when three armed men arrive at her back door.
[00:57:52.159 --> 00:57:55.182]  And attempted mass shootings will no longer end in countless lives lost.
[00:57:55.362 --> 00:57:58.946]  Where the husband and father can come home to his family after an attempted armed robbery.
[00:57:58.986 --> 00:58:07.095]  Handguns give people a fighting chance in a world where evil is no respecter of man, obeys no rules, and whose appearance cannot be determined with any precision.
[00:58:07.576 --> 00:58:10.159]  Only that its appearance will definitely be made at some point.
[00:58:10.299 --> 00:58:15.464]  In the coming days, evil will be overlooked as too easy an explanation for why Javon Belcher did what he did.
[00:58:15.484 --> 00:58:16.385]  But here's what I believe.
[00:58:16.425 --> 00:58:19.429]  You take away guns from American history, and there is no America.
[00:58:19.649 --> 00:58:23.173]  There is no platform for Bob Costa to share his opinion on national television.
[00:58:23.193 --> 00:58:26.256]  Take away guns, and you take away people's ability to protect themselves.
[00:58:26.616 --> 00:58:31.518]  You take away people's ability to protect themselves in a world where evil does everything it can to deprive us of life.
[00:58:31.558 --> 00:58:32.999]  You take away our right to life.
[00:58:33.439 --> 00:58:36.060]  In the history of man and gun, the gun has remained constant.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.442]  Always at the mercy of man's influence to launch his projectile at an intended target.
[00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:44.383]  And as far as history is concerned, man has always determined the target, whether lawfully or not.
[00:58:44.463 --> 00:58:45.584]  Alright, we're going to break.
[00:58:45.604 --> 00:58:46.925]  We'll play the rest of this coming up.
[00:58:46.965 --> 00:58:48.065]  Second hour, stay with us.
[00:58:49.265 --> 00:58:52.727]  GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:56.747 --> 00:59:02.611]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[00:59:59.135 --> 01:00:01.058]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:01.539 --> 01:00:04.283]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:14.058]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.882]  I will be giving out the phone number coming up in the next segment to take calls for at least the last hour and a half of the transmission today.
[01:00:41.902 --> 01:00:43.963]  Please have your questions and comments ready.
[01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:47.164]  Obviously, what do you think of Bob Costa's doubling down?
[01:00:47.204 --> 01:00:49.205]  That's one of the questions I'm going to be asking.
[01:00:49.725 --> 01:00:52.386]  Just basically saying men cannot be trusted to own guns.
[01:00:52.446 --> 01:00:52.926]  Men are bad.
[01:00:54.927 --> 01:00:58.229]  Government men are good, so he would like to move to North Korea.
[01:00:59.009 --> 01:01:01.690]  We have the really big news, haven't even gotten into yet in detail.
[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:08.433]  You know, we covered McClatchy yesterday, Al-Qaeda-linked group, Syrian rebels, once denied, now key to anti-Assad victories.
[01:01:09.434 --> 01:01:22.500]  So when you're walking down the street taking photos and stuff, and the cop pulls over and says, you can't take photos in America, I'll arrest you, which happens everywhere, just constantly in the news every day, you can say, really, the government admits they run Al-Qaeda?
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.782]  Uh, and are letting him take over governments.
[01:01:25.842 --> 01:01:27.043]  I mean, I look like Al Qaeda?
[01:01:27.063 --> 01:01:28.384]  I mean, because they...
[01:01:29.766 --> 01:01:33.808]  Look, officer, I know your training manuals say it's veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[01:01:33.828 --> 01:01:36.529]  Do you really think we have a good government that demonizes the founding fathers?
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:47.814]  Why don't we stop the drama queen fake reality garbage where I'm a criminal now and everyone's a suspect and no one has rights because you're doing your job keeping us safe.
[01:01:48.415 --> 01:01:55.858]  You may not be a bad person yourself, but the system is becoming criminal and oppressive and it's time for the people to push back.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.321]  Also, I haven't even really plugged this.
[01:02:03.062 --> 01:02:07.046]  Tonight on the nightly news, again my voice is shot if I'm laboring here, I apologize.
[01:02:11.289 --> 01:02:14.371]  I forgot to bring a bullhorn to the federal building yesterday and I screamed at him for 30 minutes.
[01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:14.932]  He just joined us.
[01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:19.135]  So it's a good thing I'm going to be taking your calls because I don't know if my voice is going to hold out.
[01:02:19.616 --> 01:02:21.377]  I don't even know if I can do the nightly news tonight.
[01:02:22.378 --> 01:02:25.660]  Because I'm telling you, after two more hours of this, I just don't know.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.282]  I'm actually losing my voice right now.
[01:02:29.321 --> 01:02:29.921]  Sign language.
[01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.582]  Sign language is the answer, yes.
[01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.363]  Radio sign language.
[01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:38.705]  Well, you know, all the info babes on TV reading the news, that is sign language.
[01:02:40.786 --> 01:02:44.227]  What is the international sign for headlights?
[01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:46.688]  I'm out of control.
[01:02:46.788 --> 01:02:49.249]  I apologize, and I'm not going to try to be funny.
[01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:57.953]  Joe Rogan tells me I'm really funny in private, and Bill Hicks' former producer, Kevin Booth, says I'm funnier than Bill Hicks.
[01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:01.112]  I mean, not just, I don't think that's true.
[01:03:01.692 --> 01:03:06.576]  I think I could write comedy that funny, but Bill Hicks had his own funny way of delivering it, you know.
[01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:07.957]  Well, wait a minute, I am Bill Hicks.
[01:03:08.838 --> 01:03:11.360]  I had a face change and everything else.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.381]  I am Bill Hicks.
[01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.121]  You didn't know that?
[01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:16.684]  You haven't heard that, CJ?
[01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:18.285]  Oh, you've heard it?
[01:03:18.606 --> 01:03:22.489]  No, I've had people come up on the street and go, man, Bill, that's just, it's so incredible.
[01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:23.630]  And I'm like, you're joking, right?
[01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:25.382]  I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:26.903]  I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:03:26.943 --> 01:03:30.305]  But people always say, why don't you respond on air to the fact that you're Bill Hicks?
[01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:31.966]  I have like 10 times.
[01:03:32.566 --> 01:03:33.607]  I'm not Bill Hicks, folks.
[01:03:34.847 --> 01:03:36.288]  And yeah, Bill Hicks would be like 60.
[01:03:37.068 --> 01:03:38.569]  And I've responded to it.
[01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:43.752]  And people say, oh, why don't you respond?
[01:03:43.772 --> 01:03:49.195]  I want to create a video that we can just email people and they email us or call us or whatever.
[01:03:50.506 --> 01:03:53.728]  Where it's like an auto-response, and I could tape it now and then just use that.
[01:03:53.868 --> 01:03:55.089]  Like, why I don't respond.
[01:03:55.129 --> 01:03:58.472]  It's always, RESPOND to Genesis being owned by ABC.
[01:03:58.692 --> 01:03:59.112]  It's not.
[01:03:59.553 --> 01:04:00.213]  It's a fraud.
[01:04:00.693 --> 01:04:01.434]  It's not true.
[01:04:01.774 --> 01:04:02.995]  Never owned by ABC.
[01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:07.678]  One time we leased a satellite to be on talk radio from Clear Channel and ABC.
[01:04:08.519 --> 01:04:09.879]  Because that's who own the Starguides.
[01:04:09.899 --> 01:04:10.920]  They use different satellites now.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.421]  They like saying I work for Apple because I have an Apple phone.
[01:04:15.141 --> 01:04:17.342]  I mean, it is just... It's COINTELPRO stuff.
[01:04:17.882 --> 01:04:20.823]  But people say, you need to respond to the fact that you're Bill Hicks.
[01:04:21.243 --> 01:04:22.843]  And folks, I am not Bill Hicks.
[01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:28.205]  So... They even went and found my high school yearbooks.
[01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.786]  Which is great because I can't find them.
[01:04:32.246 --> 01:04:33.667]  And my kids are always wanting to see them.
[01:04:33.927 --> 01:04:36.088]  And they scanned them for me online.
[01:04:36.108 --> 01:04:37.448]  So I'm actually pretty thankful for that.
[01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:40.695]  I found that once and sent it to you guys to save.
[01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.797]  I don't think I ever showed it on air, though.
[01:04:45.499 --> 01:04:49.342]  But, I mean, they actually went to the Rockwall Library and physically got them.
[01:04:49.882 --> 01:04:52.224]  By the way, I want my Anderson High yearbooks.
[01:04:52.685 --> 01:04:53.846]  I don't think I ever bought those.
[01:04:54.326 --> 01:04:55.507]  I did two years of high school here.
[01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:56.988]  Folks, don't look.
[01:04:57.028 --> 01:04:58.009]  Don't look at my Anderson High.
[01:04:58.289 --> 01:04:58.950]  Don't go find them.
[01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:00.311]  Because it's not real.
[01:05:00.971 --> 01:05:02.152]  No, no, no.
[01:05:02.192 --> 01:05:02.793]  Don't upload them.
[01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:03.373]  Don't upload them.
[01:05:03.393 --> 01:05:05.195]  See, I want those photos, so they'll go do it.
[01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:12.475]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:05:13.196 --> 01:05:15.998]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:05:16.438 --> 01:05:18.800]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:21.823]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:05:22.263 --> 01:05:25.266]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:05:25.766 --> 01:05:30.390]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:33.113]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:11.645]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:19.027]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:21.767]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[01:07:22.048 --> 01:07:28.109]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:07:28.769 --> 01:07:31.550]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:38.452]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[01:07:38.692 --> 01:07:43.793]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.314]  But until December 10th, we are going to
[01:07:46.374 --> 01:07:47.855]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:15.173]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:15.794 --> 01:08:16.614]  You want answers?
[01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:18.376]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:18.936 --> 01:08:22.539]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.139 --> 01:08:27.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:38.117]  All right, my friends, another hour of worldwide liberty.
[01:08:38.537 --> 01:08:50.652]  As we wage war on corruption, as we crash the lies and disinformation, as much tyranny is taking place in this world, you do not want to miss a single broadcast or segment of this radio show.
[01:08:51.809 --> 01:08:57.936]  Because when we do confront tyranny, when we do stand up against corruption, it dissipates.
[01:08:58.457 --> 01:09:04.844]  But when we roll over like a bunch of sheep to wolves, our society will go to hell in a handbasket.
[01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:10.931]  And the globalists want us to be a basket case society, so we can be sent to hell in a handbasket.
[01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:16.470]  Alright, if you just tuned in, Bob Costas went on the news last night.
[01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.931]  We're going to play that clip again in a moment.
[01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:21.832]  And says he does not back down from gun comments.
[01:09:22.293 --> 01:09:24.494]  That's Daily Herald, Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:24.534 --> 01:09:26.915]  Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks.
[01:09:28.427 --> 01:09:30.469]  And he went on to imply people are stupid.
[01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:37.234]  You know, that people are too stupid to own guns, people don't know what he meant, but he apologized for doing it during the NFL.
[01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:46.141]  So, here he is saying you shouldn't be able to own guns, basically, and endorsing the Fox sports writer, who I played clips of yesterday.
[01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:55.347]  Saying, quote, the NFL and people that support the Second Amendment, quote, are the new KKK and are racist.
[01:09:55.407 --> 01:09:58.831]  I mean, it's like saying, you know, I like a steak instead of chicken.
[01:09:58.871 --> 01:09:59.592]  Oh, that's racist.
[01:10:00.498 --> 01:10:02.279]  Oh, I don't want the TSA to stick their hands to my pants.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:02.980]  Oh, that's racist.
[01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:06.983]  Oh, I think, you know what, I like Bermuda grass instead of St.
[01:10:07.043 --> 01:10:07.363]  Augustine.
[01:10:07.383 --> 01:10:07.964]  Oh, that's racist.
[01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:12.067]  You know, I think I want to have brown floors instead of white floors.
[01:10:12.307 --> 01:10:13.108]  I think that's racist.
[01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:15.610]  You know, I like marble countertops instead of stainless steel.
[01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:16.410]  I think that's racist.
[01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:18.652]  You know, I tend to like Coke over Pepsi.
[01:10:18.772 --> 01:10:19.413]  I think that's racist.
[01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:22.395]  You know, I tend to like Dos Equis beer over Budweiser.
[01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:23.276]  I think that's racist.
[01:10:24.036 --> 01:10:26.537]  You know, I tend to like the summertime.
[01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:27.478]  People say they don't like the heat.
[01:10:27.538 --> 01:10:28.118]  I tend to like it.
[01:10:28.298 --> 01:10:28.978]  I think that's racist.
[01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:33.200]  I mean, basically, if you have any view, opinion, it's just, you're a racist.
[01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:36.602]  And the people say it and stand back, getting ready for you to fall over.
[01:10:37.682 --> 01:10:38.883]  You don't like government-run healthcare?
[01:10:39.523 --> 01:10:40.664]  Hardball Chris Matthews?
[01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:41.404]  Slimeball?
[01:10:41.744 --> 01:10:42.344]  You're a racist.
[01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:43.165]  We've played those clips.
[01:10:43.965 --> 01:10:45.065]  You don't like big government?
[01:10:45.146 --> 01:10:45.866]  You're a racist.
[01:10:46.206 --> 01:10:46.926]  You're a racist.
[01:10:46.966 --> 01:10:47.667]  You're a racist.
[01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.786]  But you know, the good news is the ADL does this.
[01:10:51.886 --> 01:11:00.312]  If you don't like the police state, if you don't like the New World Order, if you don't like Big Brother, if you don't like open borders because people come in and get free welfare and we're going bankrupt, you're a racist.
[01:11:00.752 --> 01:11:01.973]  And they say you're anti-Semitic.
[01:11:02.013 --> 01:11:06.797]  They lost a lawsuit where some theater chain owner was suing somebody over a contract.
[01:11:07.457 --> 01:11:13.502]  And they just sued him and said he was, or they came out and said he was a racist, anti-Semitic, so he sued them and won.
[01:11:17.096 --> 01:11:22.040]  I told the ADL once I was going to sue them, and they removed something out of an article because it just wasn't true.
[01:11:23.021 --> 01:11:28.025]  I mean, you know, I'm not a litigious, angry, aggressive person just out of the blue.
[01:11:28.526 --> 01:11:40.515]  When Bob Costas comes out and says gun owners and guns are to blame for things in the corrupt NFL culture, and now comes out and says you can't trust men in their 20s and 30s to own guns.
[01:11:40.535 --> 01:11:42.337]  I mean, that's a quote here.
[01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:45.900]  This is an attack on everyone.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.622]  Folks, if they get the guns, everything goes.
[01:11:48.062 --> 01:11:49.403]  If they get the First Amendment, it all goes.
[01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:50.905]  And they federalize the churches.
[01:11:51.305 --> 01:11:52.947]  Totally violates the First Amendment.
[01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:55.750]  The churches opted into it through fraud.
[01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.231]  Now they're forcing churches to do it.
[01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.272]  That's how it always starts.
[01:11:58.593 --> 01:12:03.958]  First it's voluntary, then it's mandatory, because they've got dumbed-down enforcers that will go seize churches that aren't 501c3.
[01:12:03.978 --> 01:12:04.619]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:12:09.775 --> 01:12:10.435]  What's going on?
[01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:11.876]  And it's not my opinion.
[01:12:12.156 --> 01:12:15.077]  They're only getting away with this because of a sea of ignorance.
[01:12:15.138 --> 01:12:17.859]  So we're gonna get back into this and then a bunch of other news on your phone calls.
[01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:24.002]  I'm gonna move quick now, but here's Bob Costas, a clip from him on NBC last night.
[01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:26.403]  Even of all those guns, here it is.
[01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:37.368]  Tony Dungy, one of the most respected people in all the sports on our program on Sunday night, said that one year when he coached the Colts, he had 80 players, before they cut the roster down, 80 players in training camp.
[01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:39.930]  He said, how many of you guys own a gun?
[01:12:40.391 --> 01:12:42.573]  And roughly 65 hands went up.
[01:12:43.334 --> 01:12:55.786]  Even if all those guns were obtained legally, you can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s, aggressive young men, subject to impulses, without something bad happening.
[01:12:56.306 --> 01:13:00.090]  And I posed this question, didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night, but I'll pose it here.
[01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:10.801]  Give me one example of an athlete, I know it's happened in society, but give me one example of a professional athlete, who by virtue of his having a gun,
[01:13:11.852 --> 01:13:15.234]  Took a dangerous situation and turned it around for the better.
[01:13:15.714 --> 01:13:16.995]  I can't think of a single one.
[01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:17.595]  Get lost.
[01:13:17.655 --> 01:13:19.397]  Sadly, I can think of dozens.
[01:13:19.857 --> 01:13:20.937]  Oh yeah, there you go.
[01:13:20.957 --> 01:13:23.299]  Yeah, you got an out-of-control rock star culture.
[01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:25.060]  Look at rock stars, all the bad stuff they do.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:31.063]  The killings, the deaths, the Rolling Stones caught with a dead kid in their room, sacrificed, didn't get in trouble in New York.
[01:13:31.384 --> 01:13:32.224]  Oh, you know about that.
[01:13:32.604 --> 01:13:38.128]  Look at all the corruption, the drug overdoses, the murders, the... I mean, that's...
[01:13:39.392 --> 01:13:40.672]  Most rock stars are white.
[01:13:40.872 --> 01:13:46.573]  Are we going to say all the white people are criminals because you've got a bunch of white rock stars acting like animals?
[01:13:47.534 --> 01:13:50.314]  It's the same thing with predominantly black athletes.
[01:13:50.994 --> 01:14:06.077]  I mean, obviously on growth hormone, roids, you know, heads that look like they're the size of, you know, heads on Mount Rushmore, giant shins, buffalo hump from steroids, bleep breast.
[01:14:06.557 --> 01:14:07.678]  I'm not going to say the real name of them.
[01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:08.778]  The whole deal.
[01:14:09.926 --> 01:14:11.187]  Those guys are on drugs.
[01:14:11.888 --> 01:14:16.572]  You can look at most NFL players and tell they are just roided out of their mind.
[01:14:17.592 --> 01:14:18.994]  It's like looking at a tomato.
[01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:23.097]  You can tell if it's radioactive and been GMO.
[01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:24.999]  It's ridiculous.
[01:14:25.099 --> 01:14:26.580]  I mean, I've worked out in a lot of gyms.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.781]  You can tell when somebody's on roids.
[01:14:27.981 --> 01:14:34.447]  They're walking around sweating, got zits all over them, giant chin, bloodshot eyes, staring at you like they're real tough.
[01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:39.384]  Uh, you know, that's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[01:14:39.404 --> 01:14:42.687]  And those guys are all on drugs, just like Lance Armstrong was on drugs.
[01:14:42.887 --> 01:14:45.349]  And almost all the cyclists, they're almost all on drugs.
[01:14:45.409 --> 01:14:46.170]  It's all corrupt.
[01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:46.851]  It's all a joke.
[01:14:46.891 --> 01:14:47.651]  It's all a scam.
[01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:50.414]  It's a fraud.
[01:14:50.474 --> 01:14:51.835]  Just admit it's a fraud.
[01:14:51.895 --> 01:14:53.196]  Stop being so naive.
[01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.039]  And he wants to sit there.
[01:14:57.577 --> 01:15:04.823]  And say, I mean, there have been so many cases of professional athletes getting robbed and defending themselves, or people trying to carjack them.
[01:15:04.843 --> 01:15:09.046]  I mean, I just remember, back there in the back of my mind, a bunch of cases.
[01:15:09.066 --> 01:15:17.272]  So, listeners, send us examples, because you've got, collectively, the big brain out there, to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, and I'm going to have my folks call through that.
[01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:17.612]  Help us!
[01:15:18.893 --> 01:15:21.974]  Because I know there have been a bunch of examples of people that have defended themselves.
[01:15:22.354 --> 01:15:31.838]  But I mean, you see it every day where gangs come in with guns to a computer shop or a jewelry store and a woman, an old man, pulls a gun, starts shooting them or runs them out.
[01:15:32.398 --> 01:15:41.682]  I mean, it's 14, 19, 24 times, depending on which year and which Justice Department number, and they're even trying to play it down, where people...
[01:15:42.862 --> 01:15:46.667]  Dozens of times more often use weapons to frustrate crime than when it's used.
[01:15:47.008 --> 01:15:48.329]  Any police will tell you that.
[01:15:50.232 --> 01:15:58.062]  I mean, you go into areas of New York and Chicago where they've banned the guns and where the system has allowed the drug culture to flourish, it's incredibly dangerous.
[01:15:59.599 --> 01:16:00.560]  You don't have to tell me that.
[01:16:00.881 --> 01:16:06.207]  They allow drugs to be sold and operate in areas of East Austin where I used to have to go to be on local cable access.
[01:16:06.948 --> 01:16:08.069]  I went down there for a decade.
[01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:17.961]  And I mean, I would try to find safe ways to get there because it was like ambulances and dead people everywhere and crack dealers running up and hookers running up to you.
[01:16:18.462 --> 01:16:19.883]  I don't know.
[01:16:41.181 --> 01:16:42.923]  In the middle of the night, because they were always booked up.
[01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:48.650]  Back before I even had computers or editing stuff, I would go there and make my own films, voice them on three quarter inch tape.
[01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.133]  I mean, you know, they had like 70s equipment.
[01:16:52.162 --> 01:16:57.004]  When I first got into talk radio in the first place, they're like, you can't use the computers since you're only on the weekend.
[01:16:57.284 --> 01:16:59.185]  Here, you can use this reel-to-reel tape.
[01:16:59.685 --> 01:17:02.746]  Because the little minion guy didn't like me.
[01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:10.649]  The program director and the general manager did give me the job, but some of the others didn't like me because they were like Democrats and thought I was a big Republican because I was into guns and stuff.
[01:17:11.249 --> 01:17:13.470]  And I'll never forget them going, you can use this.
[01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:16.271]  And it was like a reel-to-reel where you had to cut it and everything.
[01:17:16.571 --> 01:17:16.992]  I was like, OK.
[01:17:18.052 --> 01:17:19.592]  And he's like, you figure out how to do it.
[01:17:19.612 --> 01:17:22.693]  And I got somebody else and they go, we haven't used this in years, but I'll show you.
[01:17:22.733 --> 01:17:23.493]  That's what they say.
[01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:25.614]  They showed me and I used it.
[01:17:25.634 --> 01:17:26.234]  And you know what?
[01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:33.075]  I'm on 140 radio stations and publish a magazine and reach hundreds of millions of people a year on YouTube alone.
[01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.235]  And I'm on XM.
[01:17:34.295 --> 01:17:36.256]  You didn't stop me.
[01:17:36.276 --> 01:17:39.136]  And I'm not like, haha, I'm a big shot.
[01:17:39.737 --> 01:17:41.077]  I don't get into ego stuff.
[01:17:42.148 --> 01:17:49.577]  I'm all about defeating the globalists, but I tell you, one area is people that have tried to hold me down, and people that have tried to stop me, people that have tried to get in my way.
[01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:57.306]  I do have a real pleasure out of the fact that they're literally, I actually looked them up, they're a bunch of losers.
[01:17:57.927 --> 01:17:59.569]  The guys that gave me the jobs are big winners.
[01:18:00.523 --> 01:18:04.386]  They've moved on to bigger and better things, because they weren't intimidated by talent.
[01:18:04.606 --> 01:18:06.007]  They weren't intimidated by liberty.
[01:18:06.267 --> 01:18:07.208]  They were freedom lovers.
[01:18:07.248 --> 01:18:08.889]  They knew to give me my shot in radio.
[01:18:09.349 --> 01:18:13.672]  But all the scum nobodies that really didn't do anything around there, they hated my guts.
[01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:14.713]  You know what?
[01:18:15.453 --> 01:18:18.676]  I looked you up just last week and some of you guys, you're a bunch of losers.
[01:18:19.156 --> 01:18:19.656]  I'm a winner.
[01:18:20.036 --> 01:18:21.538]  How do you like that, you little commies?
[01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:22.898]  All right, excuse me.
[01:18:23.779 --> 01:18:25.520]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:27.642]  I just never get to this clip.
[01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:28.982]  When we come back, I'll play the clip.
[01:18:29.262 --> 01:18:30.183]  I did find the guy's name.
[01:18:30.203 --> 01:18:31.103]  I want to get him on the show.
[01:18:31.564 --> 01:18:33.885]  MrColinNor.com.
[01:18:33.985 --> 01:18:34.925]  It's his YouTube channel.
[01:18:35.566 --> 01:18:37.126]  And it's gone viral the last day.
[01:18:37.787 --> 01:18:38.687]  That's the power of it.
[01:18:40.228 --> 01:18:41.008]  Put it up yesterday.
[01:18:41.068 --> 01:18:43.029]  It's got 64,000 views in one day.
[01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:44.650]  And they hold the view count back.
[01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:46.251]  When it updates again, it's going to be like 150,000.
[01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:48.092]  Then it's going to be like a million.
[01:18:48.392 --> 01:18:51.254]  You just say something makes sense, resonates, boom!
[01:18:51.374 --> 01:18:52.094]  You're successful.
[01:18:52.414 --> 01:18:53.795]  That's the free market ideas.
[01:18:54.055 --> 01:18:55.436]  And that's what the globalists don't like.
[01:18:56.963 --> 01:18:58.164]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:18:59.786 --> 01:19:00.988]  And that's what we're dealing with here.
[01:19:01.288 --> 01:19:02.209]  Oh, I like his blog.
[01:19:02.249 --> 01:19:04.351]  It's got pictures of him with a rifle.
[01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.778]  I love muzzle burst, don't you?
[01:19:07.858 --> 01:19:09.359]  It's the symbol of freedom right there.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.502]  And so we're going to play this clip when we come back and I'll finish up on this NFL thing.
[01:19:13.742 --> 01:19:20.385]  Then I'll go to some calls and then I'll get back into the news because there is a lot of it here to cover today.
[01:19:20.786 --> 01:19:23.607]  Bureaucrat says it's wrong to advise citizens to arm themselves.
[01:19:23.887 --> 01:19:27.930]  The San Bernardino City Attorney said we can't protect you, get guns, lock your doors.
[01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:31.292]  Now he's been forced to apologize by the feds or they won't get any city money.
[01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:35.140]  Also, more reports in mainstream news.
[01:19:35.261 --> 01:19:35.681]  A U.S.
[01:19:35.741 --> 01:19:37.342]  aircraft carrier arrives off Syria.
[01:19:37.742 --> 01:19:37.962]  U.S.
[01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:41.444]  now ready for direct military confrontation to back al-Qaeda.
[01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:44.626]  Syrian rebels, when we're finished with Assad, we will fight the U.S.
[01:19:44.886 --> 01:19:46.367]  with the missiles the Pentagon gave us.
[01:19:46.547 --> 01:19:49.689]  They're publicly saying they will come here and fire missiles into aircraft.
[01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:50.510]  And that's great!
[01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:52.090]  The government's like, great job!
[01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:58.414]  Take out Assad, we'll ship you over here, let you blow up some stuff, give us a mentally retarded Patsy, we'll put him on the news.
[01:19:58.674 --> 01:19:59.235]  How's that sound?
[01:19:59.735 --> 01:20:03.857]  They're like, match made in heaven, Saudi Arabia, British intelligence, U.S.
[01:20:03.917 --> 01:20:05.417]  intelligence, Israeli intelligence.
[01:20:07.638 --> 01:20:12.440]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.861]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:20:16.301 --> 01:20:18.642]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:20:19.103 --> 01:20:21.564]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:22.044 --> 01:20:25.005]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:25.485 --> 01:20:30.050]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do the same.

[01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:40.585]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:40.765 --> 01:22:46.469]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:46.569 --> 01:22:49.991]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:50.211 --> 01:22:52.813]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.933 --> 01:22:57.856]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:57.996 --> 01:22:58.277]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.297 --> 01:22:59.638]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:05.461 --> 01:23:07.202]  Oh, my aching back!
[01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:10.084]  I've got to get some relief from my arthritis!
[01:23:10.484 --> 01:23:15.646]  When arthritis pain rears its ugly head, rub on Smooth Gator, the 60-second pain relief.
[01:23:15.926 --> 01:23:21.209]  Smooth Gator provides topical relief from head to toe and everywhere in between to stop pain fast.
[01:23:21.489 --> 01:23:27.312]  Smooth Gator is made with all natural oils, including wintergreen, aloe vera, and eucalyptus, in a safe way.
[01:23:27.372 --> 01:23:28.072]  We're good to go.
[01:23:49.818 --> 01:23:52.179]  Go to smoothgator.com or phone 727-278-3137.
[01:23:52.199 --> 01:23:54.220]  Call 727-278-3137 or click smoothgator.com.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280]  The 60 second pain relief.
[01:24:32.082 --> 01:24:38.630]  Bob Costas knows full well there are many cases of NFL athletes defending themselves from carjackings and home invasions.
[01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:41.313]  We've already found quite a few in the last five minutes.
[01:24:41.894 --> 01:24:43.095]  Listeners are sending us more.
[01:24:44.416 --> 01:24:49.378]  But he knows that the NBC audience is a bunch of dumbed-down idiots on fluoride brain damage.
[01:24:49.758 --> 01:24:52.419]  The elite revel in how they've dumbed everybody down.
[01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:53.919]  That's what they count on.
[01:24:54.199 --> 01:24:56.180]  So they don't care if we find 500 examples.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.482]  They'll just tell you that guns never protect anybody and lie to you.
[01:25:00.602 --> 01:25:01.142]  It's what they do.
[01:25:02.082 --> 01:25:05.103]  But we're going to boycott the NFL and we're going to boycott NBC.
[01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:06.023]  They're all backing him.
[01:25:06.984 --> 01:25:09.985]  And we're going to boycott you because you want to take our rights.
[01:25:10.025 --> 01:25:13.366]  You're tyrants posing as liberals who care about us when you're scum.
[01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:22.175]  And Bob Costas, of course, tried to cover up the Pedophile Valley there at Penn State, and he tried to do all that.
[01:25:22.215 --> 01:25:23.416]  I mean, he's just a piece of trash.
[01:25:23.977 --> 01:25:24.717]  That's all I can say.
[01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:27.299]  So there you go.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.781]  You are a piece of garbage, Bob Costas.
[01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:32.683]  And we know you were put up to do this, and we know you're going to be protected.
[01:25:32.703 --> 01:25:33.784]  And that's fine.
[01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:38.107]  But folks, a lot of you will turn your guns in for the NFL.
[01:25:38.127 --> 01:25:39.027]  I understand that.
[01:25:39.528 --> 01:25:40.148]  That's what matters.
[01:25:40.688 --> 01:25:41.388]  That's what you're into.
[01:25:41.768 --> 01:25:42.609]  That's your manhood.
[01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:43.109]  That's fine.
[01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:49.411]  I want to go to this clip that I mentioned by Colin Norm.
[01:25:50.131 --> 01:25:56.233]  Here he is breaking down the facts of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:25:56.253 --> 01:25:58.814]  This is some real knowledge condensed.
[01:25:58.974 --> 01:26:00.715]  So listen up and listen good.
[01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.178]  As far as I'm concerned, there is no current gun culture.
[01:26:04.518 --> 01:26:06.900]  America's gun culture began at its inception.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:14.466]  America's gun culture will ensure more and more that the woman alone at home with her kid can protect herself when three armed men arrive at her back door.
[01:26:14.566 --> 01:26:17.588]  And attempted mass shootings will no longer end in countless lives lost.
[01:26:17.768 --> 01:26:21.332]  Where the husband and father can come home to his family after an attempted armed robbery.
[01:26:21.412 --> 01:26:29.501]  Handguns give people a fighting chance in a world where evil is no respecter of man, obeys no rules, and whose appearance cannot be determined with any precision.
[01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:32.545]  Only that its appearance will definitely be made at some point.
[01:26:32.705 --> 01:26:34.447]  In the coming days, evil will be overlooked.
[01:26:34.467 --> 01:26:37.870]  That's too easy an explanation for why Javon Belcher did what he did.
[01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:38.791]  But here's what I believe.
[01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:41.835]  You take away guns from American history, and there is no America.
[01:26:42.055 --> 01:26:45.579]  There is no platform for Bob Costa to share his opinion on national television.
[01:26:45.599 --> 01:26:48.662]  Take away guns, and you take away people's ability to protect themselves.
[01:26:49.022 --> 01:26:53.905]  You take away people's ability to protect themselves in a world where evil does everything it can to deprive us of life.
[01:26:53.945 --> 01:26:55.386]  You take away our right to life.
[01:26:55.846 --> 01:26:58.468]  In the history of man and gun, the gun has remained constant.
[01:26:58.888 --> 01:27:02.850]  Always at the mercy of man's influence to launch his projectile at an intended target.
[01:27:02.971 --> 01:27:05.632]  And as far as history is concerned, man has always determined the target.
[01:27:05.872 --> 01:27:08.734]  Whether lawfully, unlawfully, negligently, or recklessly.
[01:27:08.934 --> 01:27:13.577]  To blame a gun for man's decision is to foolishly attribute free will to an inanimate object.
[01:27:13.697 --> 01:27:20.640]  The ability to carry or own a firearm is a right, not a commandment, and I respect the rights of any individual who chooses not to carry or own a firearm.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:25.122]  I only ask that the same courtesy be granted to me when I choose to exercise my right to do so.
[01:27:26.963 --> 01:27:34.307]  That's right, and this liberal idea that if someone else is going to do something bad, we need to take your rights,
[01:27:35.865 --> 01:27:37.466]  You know, oh, I guess you can't have a car.
[01:27:37.526 --> 01:27:38.606]  People kill people with cars.
[01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.868]  More people are killed with knives every year.
[01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:41.388]  Look it up.
[01:27:41.828 --> 01:27:44.309]  Worldwide, not just here in the U.S., them with guns.
[01:27:44.329 --> 01:27:45.470]  Are we going to restrict knives?
[01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:47.711]  People kill each other with bow and arrows.
[01:27:47.731 --> 01:27:48.552]  Going to restrict those?
[01:27:49.592 --> 01:27:51.233]  People kill each other with hatchets.
[01:27:51.453 --> 01:27:53.194]  People kill each other with knives in prisons.
[01:27:53.594 --> 01:27:54.895]  People use drugs in prisons.
[01:27:55.235 --> 01:27:58.257]  You can't keep anything away from anybody.
[01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:05.802]  That's why you only have to have laws to prosecute people after a crime is committed against someone else or property.
[01:28:07.343 --> 01:28:13.267]  Anybody that says, oh, we're going to be moral, we're going to ban drugs, while
[01:28:15.305 --> 01:28:17.886]  Big Pharma pushes all these deadly drugs on us as well.
[01:28:18.166 --> 01:28:24.187]  They're doing that so they can raise the price of it and control it and have a controlled market and corrupt the government.
[01:28:24.748 --> 01:28:35.211]  The British brought down the entire Chinese government and then broke the country up into more than 10 parts, resulting in the Boxer Rebellion and other things over a 50-year period of bringing opium into the country.
[01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:37.071]  The Chinese made a big mistake.
[01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:40.112]  They were the only country in the world at that time that outlawed opium.
[01:28:40.896 --> 01:28:50.746]  You could buy opium in the United States, you could buy opium in England, you could buy it in Japan, you could buy it in anywhere pretty much in Africa where there were apothecaries or shops, you could buy cocaine, you name it.
[01:28:51.226 --> 01:28:52.467]  China said...
[01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:54.380]  Opium is illegal.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.522]  Oh man, you know what happened.
[01:28:57.502 --> 01:29:03.848]  Something that was dirt cheap was now 20, 30, 40, 50, some cases 200 times what it was in other countries.
[01:29:04.448 --> 01:29:14.176]  And the British ship captains that already controlled opium worldwide, British East India, Dutch East India, Dutch East India that merged later, they would come in, they would pay off the Chinese police.
[01:29:14.616 --> 01:29:15.817]  They took over those cities.
[01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:17.138]  Took them about a decade.
[01:29:17.479 --> 01:29:21.162]  Then they took over the next key cities, up the highways, up the trainways.
[01:29:21.822 --> 01:29:23.423]  Up the railways, into the country.
[01:29:23.643 --> 01:29:24.744]  They took over those cities.
[01:29:25.224 --> 01:29:30.188]  It took them more than five decades to take over the entire country and then say, we now rule.
[01:29:30.248 --> 01:29:31.148]  Break it down!
[01:29:31.829 --> 01:29:32.769]  Break them down!
[01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:34.210]  And that's the drug war.
[01:29:35.051 --> 01:29:36.952]  They got control of the organized crime.
[01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:38.193]  They got control of the police.
[01:29:38.513 --> 01:29:39.814]  They got control of the mayors.
[01:29:39.854 --> 01:29:41.135]  They got control of the governors.
[01:29:41.855 --> 01:29:46.078]  And then they brought down the dynasty and brought down the whole government and you know the rest.
[01:29:47.205 --> 01:29:51.128]  And they broke the country up for the allied colonial powers to control it.
[01:29:51.508 --> 01:29:53.990]  That's what's being done to America and Europe with the drugs.
[01:29:55.351 --> 01:29:56.252]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.753 --> 01:29:58.354]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.294 --> 01:30:01.977]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.056 --> 01:30:10.098]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:30:10.178 --> 01:30:11.299]  Don't be one of them!
[01:30:11.399 --> 01:30:16.941]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:26.726]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[01:30:26.906 --> 01:30:33.569]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.

[01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:46.994]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:30:47.134 --> 01:30:50.575]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:30:50.796 --> 01:30:54.417]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.943]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:32:12.683 --> 01:32:15.464]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:32:15.925 --> 01:32:18.286]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:32:18.746 --> 01:32:21.267]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:32:21.747 --> 01:32:24.769]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:32:25.249 --> 01:32:29.870]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:32.591]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:36.192]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:40.553]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:32:41.033 --> 01:32:44.174]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[01:32:52.098 --> 01:32:56.340]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.962]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:32:59.982 --> 01:33:01.642]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:12.670]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:19.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.374 --> 01:33:27.797]  Yeah, there is a friendly little dog that got shot in Chicago for walking outside, not even growling at the police.
[01:33:27.877 --> 01:33:29.298]  It's been released from the clinic earlier.
[01:33:29.338 --> 01:33:29.998]  I said it was killed.
[01:33:30.018 --> 01:33:31.379]  I was rereading the article.
[01:33:32.219 --> 01:33:38.042]  But the owner says the police returned, well it's actually on video, and said, why are you talking to the media?
[01:33:38.102 --> 01:33:39.983]  You're not basically allowed to do that in America.
[01:33:40.763 --> 01:33:46.152]  Kind of like police say you're not allowed to film us all over the country, and they arrest people for wiretapping.
[01:33:47.174 --> 01:33:52.502]  I mean, if we give in to that, folks, we might as well move to North Korea, where we can really get treated like proper slaves.
[01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:55.031]  So that's coming up.
[01:33:55.712 --> 01:34:02.797]  I'm also going to get into some of the economic news and police state news.
[01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.338]  Everyone in the U.S.
[01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:08.020]  under total surveillance, NSA whistleblower says, that's already come out.
[01:34:08.841 --> 01:34:13.785]  Hacker locates John McAfee through smartphone tracks.
[01:34:14.765 --> 01:34:15.185]  I don't know.
[01:34:33.775 --> 01:34:38.217]  I think he's getting into this James Bond stuff a little bit too much and is a pretty eccentric person.
[01:34:38.957 --> 01:34:40.958]  That's my breakdown on that fellow.
[01:34:41.678 --> 01:34:44.239]  And of course, a lot of analysts say they don't believe he killed him either.
[01:34:44.279 --> 01:34:48.361]  A lot of police analysts are saying that and the Belizean government is famously corrupt.
[01:34:48.741 --> 01:34:53.243]  Also, doctor says genetically modified wheat, a perfect chronic poison.
[01:34:53.263 --> 01:35:03.007]  I want to get into 20 shocking examples of how sadistic and cruel people have become and tie it into this dehumanization that's going on.
[01:35:04.341 --> 01:35:06.923]  But before I do that, let me just give out the number here.
[01:35:07.523 --> 01:35:12.146]  On any of the issues I've covered, or whatever you'd like to talk about, what do you think about Bob Costas?

[01:35:19.431 --> 01:35:20.352]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:20.372 --> 01:35:25.455]  The reason I want to hear from you on this again is we had a lot of people calling the office and stuff wanting to get on air.
[01:35:25.475 --> 01:35:29.498]  You can tell people are really hyped when that's happening, going, I want to make a point, I want to make a point.
[01:35:30.442 --> 01:35:32.605]  And obviously we've heard a lot of logic out there.
[01:35:32.645 --> 01:35:41.136]  What would have happened if Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman would have had a gun when whoever came out of the dark with that knife was there?
[01:35:42.258 --> 01:35:46.543]  What would have, you know, happened in Nazi Germany if people hadn't been disarmed?
[01:35:46.563 --> 01:35:48.506]  I mean, the examples go on and on.
[01:35:49.173 --> 01:35:49.333]  I don't
[01:36:08.683 --> 01:36:12.926]  And by the way, it's a lie that people grew up earlier because they didn't live as long.
[01:36:14.327 --> 01:36:31.897]  There was double to triple, depending on which era and which time, of infant mortality and child mortality worldwide, from the equatorial areas to northern Europe, it's pretty much the same throughout history, that around 30 to 40 percent on the low end of children die before the age of 10.
[01:36:33.118 --> 01:36:34.279]  And most of it when they're babies.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.942]  A lot of women died in childbirth.
[01:36:37.462 --> 01:36:38.363]  I've got ancestors.
[01:36:38.383 --> 01:36:43.107]  We've done the genealogies because it's very interesting that family that's done them all in detail on both sides.
[01:36:45.009 --> 01:36:46.850]  My family genealogy is actually a lot of books.
[01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:49.232]  So my mother's got a lot of those and I've read some of them.
[01:36:50.454 --> 01:36:54.757]  And I mean, I had like great, great, great grandpas who had like four lives.
[01:36:55.578 --> 01:36:57.059]  And 40-something kids.
[01:36:57.139 --> 01:36:58.361]  I mean, they would just wear them out.
[01:36:58.821 --> 01:37:00.683]  And it wasn't that the women were being abused.
[01:37:00.703 --> 01:37:01.743]  It was just what humans did.
[01:37:01.763 --> 01:37:03.945]  You know, had one wife, had seven kids.
[01:37:04.005 --> 01:37:05.246]  Had another, had 12 kids.
[01:37:05.527 --> 01:37:06.868]  Had another, had nine kids.
[01:37:06.888 --> 01:37:07.248]  I don't know.
[01:37:07.268 --> 01:37:08.930]  I mean, you know, just armies of children.
[01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:12.012]  You know, living to 90-something years old.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:22.366]  So if you take out women dying in childbirth and children dying, people lived over 80 on average, and they've got major historical breakdowns of this, okay?
[01:37:23.407 --> 01:37:26.589]  Our life expectancy is lowering, and they now officially admit that, okay?
[01:37:26.809 --> 01:37:27.489]  Let's get that straight.
[01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:35.094]  People live on average less, even with the worst infant mortality, from the 17th and 18th century, okay?
[01:37:35.354 --> 01:37:37.136]  If you made it past 10, folks, you were tough as nails.
[01:37:38.211 --> 01:37:41.433]  All right, and that's how it is.
[01:37:41.953 --> 01:37:50.959]  Okay, so there's all these lies about this stuff, and I don't know how I got off into all that, but just how my brain works.
[01:37:51.319 --> 01:37:56.603]  What was I talking about to get off into mortality and life expectancy and lifespan and all the rest of it?
[01:37:58.001 --> 01:37:58.962]  The age of gun owners.
[01:37:59.002 --> 01:37:59.322]  Well, yeah.
[01:37:59.602 --> 01:37:59.802]  No, no.
[01:38:00.123 --> 01:38:06.707]  People were being sent when they were 10 if they showed the aptitude and were serious.
[01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:09.369]  More than intelligence, it was steadfastness and seriousness.
[01:38:09.529 --> 01:38:11.451]  People were being sent when they were 10 as couriers.
[01:38:11.691 --> 01:38:12.872]  They were being used in war.
[01:38:13.172 --> 01:38:19.176]  They were being used as trusted 10-year-old assassins, culture-wide, all cultures.
[01:38:19.937 --> 01:38:21.999]  Kids are some of the best fighters there are out there.
[01:38:23.179 --> 01:38:28.502]  And the whole issue is you're supposed to grow up and just get more and more manly.
[01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.223]  More and more knowledge.
[01:38:30.343 --> 01:38:31.384]  More and more strong.
[01:38:32.104 --> 01:38:32.485]  Okay?
[01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:42.870]  And instead, you know, you're supposed to be a kid until you're 20 and, well, I'm gonna have fun in college now and getting all this debt and then, oh, I'm just working to make money now.
[01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:43.791]  I'm working for retirement.
[01:38:43.811 --> 01:38:44.691]  Well, now I'm retired.
[01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:45.432]  I don't want to be involved.
[01:38:45.672 --> 01:38:49.174]  It's all a lie stealing your humanity from you.
[01:38:50.817 --> 01:38:58.885]  And I'm just thankful that my parents basically said there's two ways to raise somebody.
[01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.708]  You can either totally shelter them or throw them to the wind.
[01:39:02.088 --> 01:39:03.049]  And I was thrown to the wind.
[01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:04.751]  And that was a good thing.
[01:39:06.237 --> 01:39:12.522]  It was good for me, because nature puts out a lot of stuff to quote KRS-One, looking for the one.
[01:39:12.542 --> 01:39:20.267]  And I'm not saying I'm the one, but obviously all of us out there have been successful, generally it's because you've actually seen some things.
[01:39:21.228 --> 01:39:25.351]  And I look back on growing up, the things I saw, the things I've, it's been a giant adventure.
[01:39:25.811 --> 01:39:29.114]  This stuff I've done and seen, I'll never say on air because no one would believe it.
[01:39:29.844 --> 01:39:35.991]  You know, and people see what I've done the last 17 years on air, and our exploits, and our adventures, and they don't think that's real.
[01:39:36.292 --> 01:39:42.920]  Because they're living these catatonic lives in their basement, never getting out, scared of everything.
[01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:47.725]  And I've lived a primitive life, not compared to...
[01:39:48.729 --> 01:39:52.290]  Navy SEALs that do 300 missions a year or people like that.
[01:39:52.350 --> 01:40:00.871]  See, that's why even though we're a corrupt empire and what those guys are doing on average is evil and bad, you still have to respect it because it's real.
[01:40:01.852 --> 01:40:08.013]  You see, they're actually out there seeing real things, doing real things, and that's what makes you a human.
[01:40:09.773 --> 01:40:13.474]  Is the adversity, is getting past your fear, is taking action.
[01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:27.713]  I mean, 99.9% of people aren't going to march into a federal building, you know, a closed secretive shop, and get into the building through the fence, and then get in, and then confront them.
[01:40:28.493 --> 01:40:29.633]  And those feds were like, what?
[01:40:30.014 --> 01:40:33.095]  Is this a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people leader?
[01:40:33.655 --> 01:40:35.376]  Same thing when we stormed the Capitol twice.
[01:40:35.436 --> 01:40:36.336]  That's not a big deal.
[01:40:36.636 --> 01:40:37.656]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[01:40:38.477 --> 01:40:39.177]  Or you're a slave.
[01:40:41.042 --> 01:40:42.863]  So, I'm not exceptional.
[01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:46.003]  The general public is incredibly unexceptional.
[01:40:47.304 --> 01:40:47.604]  Okay?
[01:40:48.064 --> 01:40:50.804]  I mean, I go back and research my ancestors, just all of them.
[01:40:50.864 --> 01:40:52.925]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:40:53.305 --> 01:41:04.488]  The adventures, and the shootouts, and the wars, and the fighting bandits to deliver cotton to Houston, and just unending stuff.
[01:41:04.608 --> 01:41:07.869]  And, you know, somebody's rude to you at church?
[01:41:07.909 --> 01:41:09.509]  Well, let's go outside and get your gun, buddy.
[01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:13.392]  And there wasn't actually a lot of that going on because people were polite.
[01:41:13.572 --> 01:41:16.074]  Because if you cross somebody, they'd be real nice to you.
[01:41:16.094 --> 01:41:17.915]  But you crossed them, okay, let's go outside.
[01:41:19.356 --> 01:41:22.778]  You want to handle this with fists or swords or guns?
[01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:26.580]  Hollywood popularized guns.
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.781]  Most of the time people just went outside.
[01:41:27.801 --> 01:41:28.481]  Let's go outside.
[01:41:30.102 --> 01:41:31.503]  Only a coward would use a gun.
[01:41:32.104 --> 01:41:34.545]  That was in the cases where it was bad guys, bandits.
[01:41:34.585 --> 01:41:38.368]  They wanted to use a gun because they didn't want to get in a fight with some Frontiers person.
[01:41:40.112 --> 01:41:42.994]  Don't you understand where you come from, no matter what color you are?
[01:41:43.494 --> 01:41:45.516]  Every culture's gone through incredible adventures.
[01:41:45.676 --> 01:41:47.117]  Every culture's gone through adversity.
[01:41:47.337 --> 01:41:52.100]  And we have become these decadent blobs in this artificial civilization.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.681]  I'm not defending this civilization.
[01:41:54.901 --> 01:41:56.342]  The globalists say they want to replace it.
[01:41:56.522 --> 01:41:58.284]  They want to replace it with something worse.
[01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:03.067]  They want to make it more decadent, more controlled, more stratified.
[01:42:05.028 --> 01:42:06.669]  I'm ranting and I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:08.190]  The issue is that
[01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:12.695]  Now, you can't have a gun when you're 20 to 30?
[01:42:13.155 --> 01:42:14.036]  Quote from Costas.
[01:42:15.718 --> 01:42:20.862]  Guys in their 20s and 30s, aggressive young men, subject to impulse, without something bad happening.
[01:42:22.483 --> 01:42:26.927]  Well, they haven't had the life experiences up to that point.
[01:42:26.967 --> 01:42:30.550]  Now they've got 20 million dollars, and now there's people getting in their face.
[01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:36.355]  In fact, I'm reading what football players are saying, how they get robbed, how people try to carjack them, because they're big targets.
[01:42:39.574 --> 01:42:42.295]  Like Luke Scott believes guns are necessary for the safety of athletes.
[01:42:42.335 --> 01:42:42.995]  Well, no kidding.
[01:42:43.876 --> 01:42:48.917]  I mean, most people that are wealthy or are celebrities are scared to go out and take bodyguards with them.
[01:42:49.218 --> 01:43:02.382]  I mean, I bet every Hollywood person I've known has to take two or three bodyguards out, you know, who stand there in the bushes while you sit there and eat hot dogs or whatever, because people will run up and throw themselves on you.
[01:43:02.402 --> 01:43:06.264]  Schizophrenic women will run up, jump on you, and then say you raped them.
[01:43:08.484 --> 01:43:13.128]  And so of course the athletes have guns, and then some of them are decadent, they're on drugs, there's gonna be problems.
[01:43:13.348 --> 01:43:14.709]  Don't take my guns because of that.
[01:43:14.789 --> 01:43:15.710]  I know I'm ranting here.
[01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:19.112]  And so that's why I went off into all that.
[01:43:19.453 --> 01:43:22.135]  People need to grow up younger.
[01:43:23.356 --> 01:43:34.985]  People need to be in sports, but I mean full contact, mixed martial arts, boxing, all of it.
[01:43:35.045 --> 01:43:37.327]  People need to get in the ring and fight.
[01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:41.872]  My children have been in some of it, but I'm going to put them into everything.
[01:43:42.333 --> 01:43:44.954]  Because I know all the stuff and I don't even put it into function.
[01:43:45.475 --> 01:43:47.336]  People need to be in fights.
[01:43:47.416 --> 01:43:49.938]  They need to, to, to, to.
[01:43:50.658 --> 01:43:55.662]  But instead now, people don't fight and all of a sudden somebody just pulls a gun out and shoots somebody because they're such cowards.
[01:43:56.702 --> 01:43:57.803]  They want to act like a gangster.
[01:43:57.823 --> 01:43:58.824]  They start a fight with somebody.
[01:43:58.844 --> 01:44:00.825]  Oops, this person is going to beat me down.
[01:44:00.845 --> 01:44:01.646]  Let me just pull a gun out.
[01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:05.117]  Anyways, I'm ranting about this.
[01:44:05.137 --> 01:44:06.657]  They need to be in controlled combat.
[01:44:07.077 --> 01:44:10.079]  They need to be in that so they have respect for it.
[01:44:11.339 --> 01:44:14.340]  But instead, no wonder the left wants people's guns.
[01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:29.487]  They want to enslave us in controls at the top, but the average left jellyfish literally walks around like a self-propelled stomach, talks in a cowardly voice on purpose, is absolutely scared of everything, and kind of just sneaks around everywhere.
[01:44:32.402 --> 01:44:34.804]  And we need to not let these people run our culture.
[01:44:34.864 --> 01:44:36.865]  We need to rediscover testosterone.
[01:44:36.885 --> 01:44:38.306]  We need to rediscover strength.
[01:44:38.326 --> 01:44:40.127]  We need to rediscover the frontier spirit.
[01:44:40.347 --> 01:44:43.248]  We need to rediscover respect as well.
[01:44:44.269 --> 01:44:46.991]  And that's my 500 cents on it, because I've made a lot of points here.
[01:44:47.671 --> 01:44:50.873]  Let's go to Wes in Ohio on the NFL issue.
[01:44:51.433 --> 01:44:52.594]  Thank you for calling today, Wes.
[01:44:52.634 --> 01:44:53.234]  What's on your mind?
[01:44:53.254 --> 01:44:54.075]  On the NFL?
[01:44:54.115 --> 01:44:54.335]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:54.815 --> 01:44:55.696]  How are you doing today?
[01:44:55.736 --> 01:44:55.936]  Good.
[01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:56.930]  Good.
[01:44:57.471 --> 01:45:08.739]  I heard you earlier say something about Bob Costas come out with this garbage about he can't find one example of an NFL player that had a firearm could defend himself.
[01:45:08.799 --> 01:45:12.762]  Does anybody remember Sean Taylor 2007 when a shooter broke into his home and shot and killed him?
[01:45:12.782 --> 01:45:15.144]  If he had a firearm he could have defended himself.
[01:45:15.344 --> 01:45:16.065]  Very simple math.
[01:45:18.049 --> 01:45:20.511]  Well that's right, but Benny, we found a bunch of cases.
[01:45:21.132 --> 01:45:26.056]  Here we're going to have Paul Watson, or one of our other great writers, do a report on it.
[01:45:26.517 --> 01:45:27.918]  But, I mean, it's not just NFL.
[01:45:27.958 --> 01:45:29.719]  We're finding all sorts of athletes.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.043]  Folks, send us golf, baseball, shocker, basketball.
[01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:44.415]  I mean, I've seen so many cases of professional athletes running intruders off or hands up, you know, catching people robbing their houses.
[01:45:44.455 --> 01:45:51.081]  I mean, you're crazy if you live in some five, $10 million house in a wealthy neighborhood and you're a celebrity and you don't have a gun.
[01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:52.683]  I mean, I don't have bodyguards.
[01:45:52.763 --> 01:45:53.383]  I got guns.
[01:45:53.824 --> 01:45:54.804]  I got a gun in my car.
[01:45:54.845 --> 01:45:56.266]  I got a gun right here in my desk.
[01:45:56.686 --> 01:45:57.447]  I got guns.
[01:45:57.607 --> 01:45:59.369]  And I mean, it's like a tool like this pen.
[01:46:00.117 --> 01:46:03.220]  You know, anybody who tries to come after me, I mean, you know, I don't live in fear.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.781]  They can walk up behind me and kill me, you know.
[01:46:05.061 --> 01:46:06.242]  They just turn me into a martyr.
[01:46:06.762 --> 01:46:13.528]  But the point is, I don't live in fear, but at least if I see it coming, you know, you better hope I don't see you coming.
[01:46:14.128 --> 01:46:14.749]  Anything else, sir?
[01:46:17.511 --> 01:46:18.732]  You made a great point and hung up.
[01:46:18.792 --> 01:46:20.994]  Alright, Bryce in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:46:22.779 --> 01:46:24.202]  Thanks Alex for taking my call.
[01:46:24.222 --> 01:46:32.496]  Yeah, I just want to make a comment about the gun control issue and then at the beginning of the show you talked about revelation unfolding and
[01:46:34.086 --> 01:46:38.788]  I think I need some clarification on that, but I kindly disagree with you on that.
[01:46:39.488 --> 01:46:51.813]  But on the gun control, I used to be an actual person who didn't like guns and I thought they should be outlawed and we don't have a need for them because it would, you know, that whole Kool-Aid bit.
[01:46:53.098 --> 01:47:01.944]  And the history teacher told us in high school that the reason why nobody's taking over this country, whether it be domestic or foreign, is because we have the right to bear arms.
[01:47:02.484 --> 01:47:03.645]  So I'm thinking, domestic?
[01:47:03.705 --> 01:47:04.886]  What's domestic?
[01:47:05.326 --> 01:47:08.489]  We don't have any domestic enemies unless somebody tried to invade the country.
[01:47:09.409 --> 01:47:21.315]  He explained that, you know, in case of government has too much power and wants to enslave humanity, etc., you're not able to do that with 145 million people with guns.
[01:47:21.395 --> 01:47:23.756]  So, I thought that was very interesting.
[01:47:23.776 --> 01:47:25.777]  And that was, you know, 20 years ago.
[01:47:25.877 --> 01:47:30.299]  Now, you know, you talk about gun, it's such a loaded word, no pun intended, that
[01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:42.274]  You know, it's like, you know, you don't want to even talk about gun because if you talk about gun, oh, that means, you know, all these things come up, all this propaganda and Kool-Aid that's thrown in your face on a daily basis today comes up.
[01:47:42.354 --> 01:47:48.537]  So, you know, I hope people can teach the truth in the public schools out there for any public teachers and stuff.
[01:47:48.597 --> 01:47:49.598]  But, Alex?
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:47:51.901 --> 01:47:57.463]  Listen, I'm not going to get into the religious debates because it's all been scrambled up one side and down the other to deceive the people.
[01:47:58.524 --> 01:48:02.806]  But my Bible says that the rapture happens after the devil is defeated.
[01:48:02.866 --> 01:48:04.987]  It's clearly a five-year-old can read it and see that.
[01:48:05.407 --> 01:48:07.288]  And then that's all how that's interpreted.
[01:48:07.548 --> 01:48:15.672]  But the Bible has become a giant, and it's distortion, a giant cop-out with Romans 13 and Revelation to say, praise the Lord, they're trying to put chips in people.
[01:48:15.952 --> 01:48:17.813]  That means Jesus is coming back next week.
[01:48:17.853 --> 01:48:18.814]  We'll be out of here.
[01:48:19.574 --> 01:48:24.518]  And all these cultures, when they're being massacred, you know, the Tootsies by the Hooters, they were Christians.
[01:48:24.538 --> 01:48:25.860]  They thought they were about to be raptured.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.002]  Or Christians in Germany thought they were going to be raptured.
[01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:32.445]  And it's just Chinese under Mao thought they were going to be raptured.
[01:48:32.545 --> 01:48:34.327]  And it is a demonic cop-out.
[01:48:35.188 --> 01:48:40.993]  And God's not going to... Christians out there, do you think you're just going to lay around all day and let evil take over?
[01:48:41.813 --> 01:48:44.375]  And just go to your church and feel good about yourself.
[01:48:44.515 --> 01:48:45.656]  God's going to say, I don't know you.
[01:48:46.057 --> 01:48:46.357]  Go.
[01:48:47.157 --> 01:48:47.758]  Get out of here.
[01:48:47.818 --> 01:48:48.518]  Go away from me.
[01:48:48.539 --> 01:48:49.659]  I don't know you.
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:52.782]  Because what you do to the least of these, you do to me.
[01:48:53.222 --> 01:48:55.284]  But I don't want to get into a debate, okay?
[01:48:55.584 --> 01:48:58.686]  I just know, as a creator of the universe, I have a spiritual connection.
[01:48:58.867 --> 01:48:59.847]  I know what I need to do.
[01:49:00.328 --> 01:49:04.431]  And there's a bunch of Pharisees talking about, don't listen to music, or don't do this or that.
[01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:06.392]  But they're not out protesting abortion clinics.
[01:49:06.412 --> 01:49:08.853]  They're not out speaking about cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:49:09.133 --> 01:49:13.656]  They're just a bunch of Pharisees, the same ones telling Christ, don't hang out with that prostitute.
[01:49:13.676 --> 01:49:15.036]  Don't hang out with the tax collector.
[01:49:15.296 --> 01:49:16.397]  Don't hang out with these people.
[01:49:16.677 --> 01:49:18.158]  Why do you think he was hanging out with them?
[01:49:18.398 --> 01:49:19.819]  To bring them the information.
[01:49:21.075 --> 01:49:24.577]  I mean, I've been friends with Joe Rogan since, I guess, 14 years.
[01:49:24.597 --> 01:49:24.957]  Since about 98.
[01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:26.078]  Smart guy.
[01:49:26.098 --> 01:49:26.498]  I like him.
[01:49:26.578 --> 01:49:26.858]  Funny.
[01:49:26.898 --> 01:49:29.139]  Don't agree with some of the things he says or what he stands for.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.220]  Don't particularly like some of the worldliness.
[01:49:31.281 --> 01:49:32.001]  Not that I'm perfect.
[01:49:32.321 --> 01:49:32.741]  But, man.
[01:49:33.162 --> 01:49:34.042]  Plus, I like him.
[01:49:34.102 --> 01:49:35.683]  Plus, having him on.
[01:49:35.703 --> 01:49:37.564]  We're going to air a big thing with him tomorrow.
[01:49:38.364 --> 01:49:39.825]  A big interview I did this weekend.
[01:49:40.626 --> 01:49:42.687]  Gets his entire audience to tune in here.
[01:49:43.027 --> 01:49:43.507]  Duh!
[01:49:43.827 --> 01:49:46.469]  Now we're waking them up to the cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:50.411]  Now we're... I mean, I was on Chicago TV this morning.
[01:49:51.075 --> 01:49:54.457]  Talking about the cancer viruses and the vaccines and reading over documents.
[01:49:54.497 --> 01:49:57.358]  I mean, I want to warn people about cancer viruses.
[01:49:57.778 --> 01:49:58.779]  I want to reach them.
[01:49:58.899 --> 01:50:01.480]  I want to reach the worldly people.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.641]  I want to affect them.
[01:50:04.821 --> 01:50:09.763]  Yeah, I remember Doug Stanhope when I first met him about 11 years ago, you know, right after 9-11.
[01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.583]  He didn't believe it was, you know, thought it was wrong.
[01:50:11.903 --> 01:50:13.224]  Now he says it's an inside job.
[01:50:13.884 --> 01:50:15.705]  Now he says the bin Laden raid's totally fake.
[01:50:16.265 --> 01:50:23.347]  Doug Stanhope, incredibly funny, incredibly profane, very, you know, eugenics-based, doesn't understand that.
[01:50:23.947 --> 01:50:31.010]  But by being friends with him, and that's not why I do it, I learn how it turned into something good, I then can reach out to all his huge fans.
[01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:33.252]  And now I'm changing him.
[01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:34.153]  You see?
[01:50:34.453 --> 01:50:36.736]  Doesn't mean I fully changed him, but I'm changing him.
[01:50:37.056 --> 01:50:37.877]  I'm changing him.
[01:50:38.618 --> 01:50:39.379]  Do you understand that?
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:41.160]  Hello?
[01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:42.462]  Yes, do you understand that?
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.321]  Oh yeah, no, I agree.
[01:50:44.401 --> 01:50:47.302]  No, hey, I don't want to talk about the rapture, that's not the point.
[01:50:47.782 --> 01:50:56.207]  It's that the revelation, we're talking about the end times, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists out there that think all this stuff is pointing towards the end times and that's not the point.
[01:50:56.227 --> 01:50:56.727]  No, I understand.
[01:50:56.747 --> 01:51:02.030]  Listen, I don't believe the end of the world or revelation was 70 AD and the sacking of Jerusalem by Titus.
[01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:04.491]  Believe me, I know all this information, sir.
[01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:08.813]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:51:09.053 --> 01:51:12.995]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:51:13.195 --> 01:51:15.276]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:51:15.477 --> 01:51:20.499]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:22.380]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:23.801]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:51:24.001 --> 01:51:25.441]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:51:25.481 --> 01:51:28.523]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:51:28.843 --> 01:51:33.887]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:51:34.227 --> 01:51:43.355]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:51:43.555 --> 01:51:45.877]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:51:45.917 --> 01:51:47.618]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:51:52.202 --> 01:51:58.629]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:51:58.769 --> 01:52:01.912]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[01:52:02.092 --> 01:52:02.473]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:02.513 --> 01:52:05.736]  Hi there.
[01:52:06.337 --> 01:52:07.398]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:52:07.858 --> 01:52:11.042]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:11.702 --> 01:52:20.488]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:52:20.849 --> 01:52:26.873]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:52:27.573 --> 01:52:29.135]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:52:29.755 --> 01:52:34.839]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:52:35.599 --> 01:52:42.683]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:52:43.543 --> 01:52:48.445]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:52:49.126 --> 01:52:55.009]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:52:55.629 --> 01:53:01.012]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:01.392 --> 01:53:02.552]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:53:05.188 --> 01:53:07.309]  So it's off to Grandma's house for the holidays, eh?
[01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:08.390]  That's great!
[01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:16.034]  But, while you're going over the river and through the woods, professional burglars are choosing easy targets to break into.
[01:53:16.414 --> 01:53:17.975]  Don't be an easy target.
[01:53:18.295 --> 01:53:19.956]  Plug in fake TV.
[01:53:20.356 --> 01:53:23.998]  Fool criminals into believing someone's home at your house watching TV.
[01:53:24.398 --> 01:53:29.501]  Fake TV works a bit like a light on a timer, but fake TV is far more convincing.
[01:53:29.781 --> 01:53:34.364]  Fake TV plugs into any outlet and simulates the light and colors of a real TV.
[01:53:34.964 --> 01:53:38.906]  Burglars will likely move on to easier targets and leave your house alone.
[01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:44.268]  Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:47.590]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays or any time.
[01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:51.192]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[01:53:51.272 --> 01:53:52.732]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[01:53:52.812 --> 01:53:54.553]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:19.116]  We have examples of professional athletes and NFL people protecting themselves with guns everywhere.
[01:54:19.576 --> 01:54:20.817]  And Bob Costas knows that.
[01:54:21.598 --> 01:54:26.740]  He just thinks his audience is so stupid he'll go, there's not one example of them ever doing something good with a gun.
[01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:29.342]  You know, these athletes, they're young, they're out of control.
[01:54:29.642 --> 01:54:30.783]  He means they're black.
[01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:32.050]  They can't be.
[01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:34.892]  I mean, it's such condescending racism.
[01:54:35.172 --> 01:54:38.434]  Yeah, is there some gangbanger culture across the board in professional sports?
[01:54:38.454 --> 01:54:38.794]  Yeah.
[01:54:39.235 --> 01:54:41.116]  But that is a minority.
[01:54:41.336 --> 01:54:42.376]  The whole thing's decadent.
[01:54:42.556 --> 01:54:43.117]  I don't like it.
[01:54:43.597 --> 01:54:44.057]  You know that.
[01:54:44.358 --> 01:54:46.399]  It's turned into a gladiatorial Rome diversion.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.602]  But, you know, this statement, well, these 20- and 30-year-olds, you know, they can't have guns.
[01:54:51.682 --> 01:54:54.964]  I can't see any good going on, Bob Costas.
[01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:59.770]  And that's what the left did, the handgun control group did.
[01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:02.631]  A white guy brought in two black guys in, what was it, 99.
[01:55:02.851 --> 01:55:05.793]  It was in the cover of the Statesman, Metro and State.
[01:55:06.253 --> 01:55:06.673]  Look it up.
[01:55:07.973 --> 01:55:10.074]  Alex Jones catches bribery at State Capitol.
[01:55:10.094 --> 01:55:11.095]  The video's on YouTube.
[01:55:12.325 --> 01:55:19.569]  Uh, and, uh, a lady runs in and says, hey, that guy's paying those people $300 a piece saying good testimony.
[01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:20.530]  And it was like a movie.
[01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:23.672]  I walk out, he's paying the last one.
[01:55:23.692 --> 01:55:23.672]  20, 40, 50, 100.
[01:55:25.193 --> 01:55:26.313]  Here's another hundred.
[01:55:26.794 --> 01:55:28.054]  And I go, you just got paid off.
[01:55:28.114 --> 01:55:28.875]  Yeah, we did.
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:31.560]  You know, oh look, it's your little kid.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:32.421]  I go, that's not my son.
[01:55:32.441 --> 01:55:33.641]  They go, oh yeah, it is.
[01:55:33.761 --> 01:55:35.662]  Ah ha ha, making fun of some lady's kid.
[01:55:36.442 --> 01:55:37.922]  And it turned out it was illegal.
[01:55:38.083 --> 01:55:38.863]  Nobody got in trouble.
[01:55:38.883 --> 01:55:41.864]  It was a State Ethics Commission investigation and they found it was illegal.
[01:55:42.964 --> 01:55:44.304]  The chairman of the committee got in trouble.
[01:55:45.685 --> 01:55:52.267]  And it was a white guy bringing black guys in to stand up and go, we're, you know, gang members, or were, and we're scary.
[01:55:52.387 --> 01:55:57.909]  Ban guns for, you know, ban the shooting sports in Texas is what they were going to do, and ban the gun shows.
[01:55:59.482 --> 01:56:02.404]  This is how they operate, and I for one am sick of it.
[01:56:02.764 --> 01:56:04.626]  Let's go to a phone call.
[01:56:04.746 --> 01:56:06.747]  Chris in Georgia on Communism.
[01:56:06.787 --> 01:56:07.168]  Go ahead.
[01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:10.530]  Come ahead, Chris.
[01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:11.791]  You're on the air, I promise.
[01:56:11.811 --> 01:56:14.973]  Alright, let's move to the next person.
[01:56:15.013 --> 01:56:16.514]  Let's talk to Nicole in Michigan.
[01:56:16.534 --> 01:56:17.115]  You're on the air.
[01:56:17.135 --> 01:56:18.736]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:18.756 --> 01:56:18.796]  Hi.
[01:56:18.816 --> 01:56:21.538]  I just wanted to mention a couple of things.
[01:56:22.145 --> 01:56:29.919]  First off, I'm an herbalist and I would recommend that you get yourself some peppermint and honey tea to help soothe your throat right now.
[01:56:34.324 --> 01:56:43.229]  I was under the misguided, I'm using sarcasm here, but I was under the misguided notion that we've got terrorists all over the place.
[01:56:43.349 --> 01:56:49.712]  Shouldn't we as American people be able to defend ourselves against these evil terrorists that we keep getting told that are all over?
[01:56:50.032 --> 01:56:59.777]  Well, the problem is, that's a good point, is that when you get all the training manuals that are public, there's nothing about Al Qaeda, it's all about American gun owners.
[01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:04.992]  And conservatives and veterans and how we need to be disarmed and put in re-education centers.
[01:57:05.032 --> 01:57:06.473]  That's now in the official army manual.
[01:57:07.233 --> 01:57:10.534]  We've literally given you the code number for probably 50 times.
[01:57:11.214 --> 01:57:13.895]  And here's McClatchy, LA Times, you name it.
[01:57:14.395 --> 01:57:19.777]  Al-Qaeda group Syrian rebels once denied now key to anti-Assad victories.
[01:57:20.497 --> 01:57:22.758]  The CFR three months ago said they're commanding Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:24.018 --> 01:57:24.198]  U.S.
[01:57:24.258 --> 01:57:25.779]  aircraft carrier arrives off Syria.
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:26.500]  U.S.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.421]  now ready for direct military confrontation.
[01:57:28.461 --> 01:57:35.105]  That's PrisonPlanet.com, but direct links to the Australian newspaper, Debka File, and Turkey newspapers.
[01:57:35.605 --> 01:57:40.348]  And so they're now ready for a direct confrontation with the Assad regime, backed up by the Russian government.
[01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:46.152]  And our government has put in at least 50,000 al-Qaeda fighters and has given them missiles.
[01:57:46.572 --> 01:57:48.933]  Shoulder-fired, surface-to-air, to bring down aircraft.
[01:57:48.953 --> 01:57:52.836]  They are shooting down helicopters, jets, you name it, and they are in the news.
[01:57:53.756 --> 01:57:59.460]  Syrian rebels, and this is in McClatchy Newspapers, when we finish with Assad, we will fight the U.S.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:04.364]  So, we need to have articles, prepare for missiles to bring down aircraft, and the feds love it.
[01:58:04.524 --> 01:58:17.853]  They will let the men blow up, they will shoot aircraft when you take off from your local airport, they will blow the engine off, they will kill you, and the media will say we've got to give our rights up, and there'll be no discussion that our government gave them the missiles and runs al-Qaeda.
[01:58:17.873 --> 01:58:18.474]  What do you think of that?
[01:58:19.881 --> 01:58:20.882]  Oh yeah, I believe it.
[01:58:21.082 --> 01:58:22.943]  There's one other thing I wanted to mention.
[01:58:22.963 --> 01:58:23.043]  Sure.
[01:58:23.223 --> 01:58:40.595]  There's a diverse... I don't know if diverse is the word, but there's a clear difference between the people that grow up with the parents teaching them how to go hunting and how much fun and spending quality... That's a good point.
[01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:40.975]  Stay there.
[01:58:41.015 --> 01:58:42.576]  I'm coming back to you in 60 seconds.
[01:58:42.896 --> 01:58:43.397]  Stay with us.

[01:59:04.483 --> 01:59:06.543]  Solar power generators are now available.
[01:59:06.683 --> 01:59:10.124]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:59:10.324 --> 01:59:16.125]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:59:16.405 --> 01:59:19.766]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:59:20.106 --> 01:59:24.709]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[01:59:24.849 --> 01:59:30.573]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:59:30.833 --> 01:59:31.874]  And here's the best news.

[02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:16.291]  You want answers?
[02:00:17.092 --> 02:00:18.033]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:18.634 --> 02:00:22.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:26.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.586 --> 02:00:33.128]  Alright, I'm really going to try to race through your calls in the next segment, and we've got our Bin Laden raid footage released.
[02:00:33.148 --> 02:00:37.269]  If you believe that, the Easter Bunny will also give you some eggs coming up on Easter.
[02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:42.271]  But we're going to be breaking that down a lot in this third hour right now.
[02:00:43.091 --> 02:00:44.352]  There always is a lot in the third hour.
[02:00:45.009 --> 02:00:46.130]  I don't know which hour is the best, though.
[02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:48.611]  I think the first is the best sometimes, and I think the third is the best.
[02:00:49.012 --> 02:00:52.754]  Then I'm forced to cover everything in the third hour, but I rant pretty good and I'm fresh in the first hour.
[02:00:52.774 --> 02:00:55.796]  I don't know, but we have a lot of guests in the second hour, so what is the best?
[02:00:56.356 --> 02:00:57.777]  Let's talk to Nicole in Michigan.
[02:00:57.817 --> 02:01:01.860]  She was finishing up getting into... Well, restate what you were saying.
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:02.160]  Go ahead.
[02:01:03.217 --> 02:01:21.608]  Well, the thing I've noticed is that, you know, the families that the parents teach the kids how to use the guns, gun safety, and they make it a family thing to go out and go hunting and forage for their own food, have less gun
[02:01:22.348 --> 02:01:23.469]  Related issues.
[02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:25.089]  Less accidents.
[02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:26.010]  No, no, I agree.
[02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:33.093]  A lot of people don't get guns until they're 20 or 30 and they think it's all movies and then it's like, they've noticed if you put somebody in a uniform, they act authoritative.
[02:01:33.113 --> 02:01:36.874]  Or if you put somebody in lingerie, they, you know, they suddenly get sexually excited.
[02:01:37.275 --> 02:01:40.956]  It's the same thing of, here's a gun, they get all crazy with it.
[02:01:40.976 --> 02:01:43.697]  It's like a deer hunter who's 30 years old, never gone deer hunting.
[02:01:43.717 --> 02:01:49.580]  The first deer they see, they start shaking and freak out or shoot the neighbor's cow because, you know, they call it buck fever.
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.683]  You know, it's kind of like these greenhorn cops that can't even swim, can't even fight.
[02:01:54.003 --> 02:01:59.087]  Now they're pulling you over, they're so scared, they shoot you because they think you're Al-Qaeda, because the news told them so.
[02:01:59.848 --> 02:02:10.676]  But also, when you take your kids out in the garden, or you take them out hunting, or you take them out camping, they're designed to do this, and they get into the ooga-booga mode and start, you know, really getting excited.
[02:02:11.116 --> 02:02:13.698]  But if you don't do it when they're young, they never get into it.
[02:02:14.239 --> 02:02:16.020]  So it's part of the domestication process.
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:16.440]  I agree.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:16.901]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:18.155 --> 02:02:30.803]  My father, when he noticed I was getting interested in his guns, the first thing he did was went to the grocery store and bought some watermelons and shot them in front of me to show me how dangerous guns really are.
[02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:41.269]  Because you can't tell a kid how dangerous a gun is with words, because kids, they see information, the hearing information doesn't register as well.
[02:02:43.225 --> 02:02:45.930]  Who shot up some watermelons to show me?
[02:02:46.090 --> 02:02:46.932]  These are not toys.
[02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:48.034]  You don't touch these.
[02:02:48.375 --> 02:02:49.076]  These can kill you.
[02:02:49.727 --> 02:02:53.950]  Yeah, what's done in the country is you're always slaughtering pigs or cows.
[02:02:54.730 --> 02:02:58.472]  And what you do is, you know, you take somebody out and you say, don't touch the guns.
[02:02:59.313 --> 02:03:00.654]  And people say, oh, this is so primitive.
[02:03:00.694 --> 02:03:02.895]  No, this is what humans have done with swords and things.
[02:03:02.915 --> 02:03:05.117]  You look back and, you know, you got to butcher it.
[02:03:05.757 --> 02:03:06.958]  And you shoot the cow in the head.
[02:03:07.358 --> 02:03:12.921]  The kids think it's interesting because they're designed to not think it's false that they'd be freaked out butchering fish or cows or whatever.
[02:03:13.282 --> 02:03:18.485]  And then, you know, the tractor pulls them up by chains in the barn and you butcher the cow right there and they learn how to do it.
[02:03:18.945 --> 02:03:19.746]  That's real interesting.
[02:03:19.786 --> 02:03:23.388]  There's the liver, there's the kidneys, there's the cow's three stomachs.
[02:03:24.389 --> 02:03:27.691]  But they understand, you aim this at something, it kills it.
[02:03:28.511 --> 02:03:32.594]  Now, I've seen stuff butchered, but that's not how I was taught when I was about four years old.
[02:03:33.515 --> 02:03:36.597]  I was interested in guns and they took me out and let me shoot Folgers coffee cans.
[02:03:37.137 --> 02:03:40.279]  With a .410 shotgun and I wanted to shoot the 12-gauge, let me shoot that.
[02:03:40.339 --> 02:03:40.980]  Thought it was great.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.041]  That's why I shoot 50 cows handheld.
[02:03:43.061 --> 02:03:43.782]  Don't think they kick.
[02:03:43.822 --> 02:03:44.822]  People think guns have kicks.
[02:03:44.842 --> 02:03:45.763]  I don't know what they're talking about.
[02:03:45.783 --> 02:03:46.764]  You pull it in your shoulder.
[02:03:47.284 --> 02:03:50.286]  And then my dad said, all right, see that Tweety Bird up there in that tree?
[02:03:50.486 --> 02:03:54.369]  It was a bird you're not supposed to hunt, but that's, you know, how you teach him whatever's available.
[02:03:54.729 --> 02:03:57.251]  And he takes a 12-gauge, blows the Tweety Bird to bits.
[02:03:57.311 --> 02:03:59.092]  And I thought that was a little sad.
[02:03:59.112 --> 02:04:00.493]  His little feet was all that was left.
[02:04:00.833 --> 02:04:02.294]  He said, you don't touch these.
[02:04:02.934 --> 02:04:03.115]  Ever.
[02:04:03.975 --> 02:04:08.058]  And then nobody in farming towns ever gets shot.
[02:04:08.098 --> 02:04:10.339]  My dad went to a pretty big farming school.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:21.246]  He went hunting with his coaches on their farms and people, and with the principal and stuff, and they all brought their shotguns unloaded with their boxes of shells, put them right in their lockers, and they'd all go out hunting together.
[02:04:21.747 --> 02:04:22.988]  I mean, that's just what you did.
[02:04:23.008 --> 02:04:26.730]  And that's so alien to people today.
[02:04:26.770 --> 02:04:27.470]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:28.391 --> 02:04:29.652]  The sad part is
[02:04:30.467 --> 02:04:35.151]  Most of our children today learn how to hunt through video games.
[02:04:36.492 --> 02:04:39.294]  Their parents are absent in that regard.
[02:04:39.314 --> 02:04:41.896]  Their parents don't realize
[02:04:42.389 --> 02:04:48.394]  That these kids are sitting in their rooms using the computer and the video game to babysit them.
[02:04:48.454 --> 02:04:52.497]  Exactly, and then it's been proven to dehumanize you where real killing doesn't affect you anymore.
[02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:56.360]  That's why real men would get upset by death because they knew it was real.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:05.528]  I mean, let me tell you, when you got a buck 20 yards below you with a compound bow pulled back and he looks right in your eyes and you let that thing go, I mean, you know, it's something when they fall over and die.
[02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:12.730]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:05:13.611 --> 02:05:19.515]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[02:08:22.574 --> 02:08:27.400]  Here's some of the top stories right now on our news website, InfoWars.com, and I'm going right to your calls.
[02:08:28.001 --> 02:08:33.228]  DARPA-sponsored company unveils drones that can fly through doors and windows.
[02:08:33.829 --> 02:08:36.813]  Tiny craft could be deployed by police into buildings and homes.
[02:08:37.574 --> 02:08:40.295]  And of course they'll be weaponized using your tax money.
[02:08:40.775 --> 02:08:49.419]  An article over seven million dollars a year has given police departments to buy armored wheeled tanks, machine guns, you name it, speed boats, hand grenade launchers, you name it.
[02:08:49.439 --> 02:08:50.579]  They're preparing for war with us.
[02:08:51.179 --> 02:08:51.400]  U.S.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.660]  aircraft carrier arrives off the Syrian coast.
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:53.961]  U.S.
[02:08:54.001 --> 02:08:59.183]  military is announcing they're preparing for direct intervention to put al-Qaeda in charge in that country.
[02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:03.084]  And that is in McClatchy News, AP, LA Times, you name it.
[02:09:04.005 --> 02:09:04.665]  All admitting
[02:09:05.325 --> 02:09:08.226]  That our government runs Al-Qaeda, and so now they're not going to hide it.
[02:09:08.246 --> 02:09:09.207]  They're just like, Al-Qaeda's good.
[02:09:10.067 --> 02:09:16.670]  So next time the TSA wants to go in your wife's pants, just say, what do you think the government's Al-Qaeda is in there, or are you just some pervert?
[02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:19.771]  It's all about being dominated by these people.
[02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:27.175]  And we've got that report coming up in Chicago, where they shoot the guy's dog for no reason, and the cops show up while the media's there, and say you're not allowed to talk to the media.
[02:09:27.535 --> 02:09:28.515]  I mean, that's North Korea.
[02:09:29.015 --> 02:09:29.936]  You want to live in North Korea?
[02:09:29.976 --> 02:09:30.356]  There it is.
[02:09:30.876 --> 02:09:32.057]  They want you under their thumb.
[02:09:32.717 --> 02:09:33.657]  It's very sad.
[02:09:34.838 --> 02:09:39.460]  Mike in Oregon, you are on the air, listening via free Android app.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:40.421]  Welcome, Mike.
[02:09:40.441 --> 02:09:42.762]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:44.182]  I'm doing good, brother.
[02:09:44.222 --> 02:09:46.443]  What's on your mind today, after all the topics we've covered?
[02:09:48.224 --> 02:09:54.567]  Well, I'm kind of still upset about the Costas and Whitlock remarks, and I actually got a comment for the both of them.
[02:09:56.905 --> 02:10:07.693]  For Mr. Kostas, 2009 July 4th, Mr. Steve McNair, good quarterback, he was killed in his sleep or shot by something.
[02:10:07.713 --> 02:10:09.735]  I think it was his ex-wife or something.
[02:10:10.775 --> 02:10:13.778]  If he had a gun, he probably would still be alive today.
[02:10:15.504 --> 02:10:23.132]  Another one following up this other comment about a room of 25-year-old steroid addicts all pumped up having handguns.
[02:10:23.172 --> 02:10:30.940]  What about the 40,000 18 to 21-year-olds in Afghanistan under hangers that are just brainwashed into killing people?
[02:10:31.567 --> 02:10:32.568]  Well, that is the issue.
[02:10:33.129 --> 02:10:35.431]  Listen, the average person gets in the military at about 20.
[02:10:35.952 --> 02:10:37.894]  The average service is about five years.
[02:10:37.914 --> 02:10:38.695]  You can look this up.
[02:10:39.196 --> 02:10:40.297]  I was thinking that this morning.
[02:10:40.818 --> 02:10:43.801]  Costas is saying you can't trust 20 to 30 year olds with guns.
[02:10:44.081 --> 02:10:44.522]  He said that.
[02:10:44.562 --> 02:10:45.423]  I played the clip twice.
[02:10:45.463 --> 02:10:48.667]  If you just tuned in, the clip's up at Infowars.com.
[02:10:49.127 --> 02:10:49.908]  You want to go watch it.
[02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.291]  You have the full clip of Costas.
[02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:54.593]  And he came out and said, I don't apologize.
[02:10:54.673 --> 02:10:58.175]  In fact, people shouldn't even have guns if they're 20 to 30 years of age.
[02:10:59.116 --> 02:10:59.536]  Period.
[02:11:00.457 --> 02:11:04.881]  And so Wall Street Journal says that he refuses to apologize and throws it in everybody's face.
[02:11:05.381 --> 02:11:08.984]  So Costas, here it is, Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks.
[02:11:09.684 --> 02:11:10.665]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[02:11:11.826 --> 02:11:14.728]  And it shows that he wants your guns.
[02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:21.052]  If there are bad 20-year-olds out there, I need my gun to protect myself.
[02:11:21.112 --> 02:11:24.334]  But there's this idea that we can only trust the government.
[02:11:24.594 --> 02:11:26.655]  What about all the steroid cops out there?
[02:11:26.695 --> 02:11:30.957]  Some police departments admit their police are on steroids, like in Fort Worth.
[02:11:33.735 --> 02:11:38.040]  It's been in the news where their chief has said steroids is good for them.
[02:11:38.821 --> 02:11:50.334]  And, you know, I understand with the bisphenol A and the feminizing hormones they put in the food and water on purpose, and loveless brag about how they do that, by the way, that's not my opinion, that may be moderate for some of those guys.
[02:11:50.935 --> 02:11:53.037]  If they are sissified, I can see putting them on it.
[02:11:54.058 --> 02:11:58.401]  A little bit, but I mean, I couldn't imagine having extra testosterone.
[02:12:00.163 --> 02:12:01.864]  I've got plenty, that's why my hair is falling out.
[02:12:02.804 --> 02:12:05.867]  But the point is, well, I'm just ranting about this.
[02:12:06.247 --> 02:12:09.589]  What about all the roided up soldiers coming back and cops and all the rest of it?
[02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:21.958]  And the answer is, well, the government says those that don't join them are terrorists, and those that do join them are above the law and godlike, and in Chicago tell people, well, we shot your dog, you can't talk to the media, we're God.
[02:12:23.908 --> 02:12:24.469]  Anything else, sir?
[02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:31.858]  Yeah, statistically, cops kill way more people than the average citizen, along with their own fellow cops.
[02:12:32.319 --> 02:12:37.966]  Along with their little drug raids, they go and shoot one of their fellow cops, then they blame it on the guy they just mowed down.
[02:12:38.885 --> 02:12:40.326]  By the way, that does happen a lot.
[02:12:40.366 --> 02:12:41.126]  That's been confirmed.
[02:12:41.166 --> 02:12:42.047]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:42.347 --> 02:12:44.588]  There are a lot of good police departments out there overall.
[02:12:45.469 --> 02:12:46.410]  But there are a lot of bad ones.
[02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.350]  And they're getting worse.
[02:12:47.770 --> 02:12:50.432]  And we need to rein it in.
[02:12:50.492 --> 02:12:53.254]  But the globalists want a bunch of people that will follow orders.
[02:12:53.294 --> 02:12:55.175]  They want authoritarian thugs.
[02:12:55.775 --> 02:12:57.116]  And that's where we're going in this country.
[02:12:57.136 --> 02:12:58.237]  And it's not good for anybody.
[02:12:59.117 --> 02:13:02.038]  Let's talk to Braun in Alabama.
[02:13:02.498 --> 02:13:03.879]  Let's talk about the NFL.
[02:13:04.059 --> 02:13:14.903]  And for those that don't know, the sports writer at Fox that Kostas said he agreed with and quoted, he says gun ownership is racist and all gun owners are Ku Klux Klan members.
[02:13:15.463 --> 02:13:17.524]  The NRA is Ku Klux Klan.
[02:13:17.544 --> 02:13:18.605]  I played the clip yesterday.
[02:13:18.625 --> 02:13:21.166]  And the people on the show with him agree.
[02:13:22.291 --> 02:13:33.253]  Even though the Ku Klux Klan is on record getting the South to pass gun restrictions, the first gun laws after the Civil War, so blacks couldn't defend themselves, so they could go burn down their houses and kill them and lynch them.
[02:13:33.973 --> 02:13:36.294]  And they kept blacks from getting guns and they killed them.
[02:13:37.154 --> 02:13:42.855]  So he takes the truth and literally inverts it on its head and the media praises him.
[02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:45.416]  So that's News Corp for you.
[02:13:46.036 --> 02:13:47.396]  I'm sorry, go ahead Bron.
[02:13:49.216 --> 02:13:51.717]  You're totally right, that speaks to the whole disconnect.
[02:13:52.242 --> 02:14:00.733]  But you know that's exactly why I called because I had a suggestion for you because you could really maximize your Twitter following just by doing a few more things.
[02:14:01.874 --> 02:14:04.458]  Basically I think that especially if you
[02:14:05.657 --> 02:14:12.422]  I agree.
[02:14:12.442 --> 02:14:22.490]  I don't know how Twitter works and I've got some of the crew using it who knows something, but most of it's me or I tell them to do something and then it's not their fault.
[02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:25.272]  I don't give them enough directions and some stuff goes out that I don't agree with.
[02:14:25.692 --> 02:14:27.953]  I need to get to take more control of the Twitter.
[02:14:28.254 --> 02:14:30.195]  You see stuff at night or on the weekend, it's me.
[02:14:30.655 --> 02:14:32.756]  During the week I say, hey, tweet this out and it goes out.
[02:14:32.816 --> 02:14:34.277]  Then they overall do a pretty good job.
[02:14:34.517 --> 02:14:35.618]  But you're right, I see that.
[02:14:35.898 --> 02:14:40.421]  We need to tweet at the people attacking them, baiting them in.
[02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:42.422]  We need to get people to follow us.
[02:14:42.542 --> 02:14:49.206]  We need to, because Twitter is one area where we used to have like seven or eight accounts and we combined them, it was like 600,000 people.
[02:14:49.246 --> 02:14:50.066]  Our biggest one only has 120,000.
[02:14:51.867 --> 02:14:55.968]  And then we'll kind of promote little things we're doing, but not the big things.
[02:14:56.048 --> 02:14:56.709]  And it's my fault.
[02:14:57.069 --> 02:15:07.672]  I'm not directing the one lady that works here and kind of works on planetinfowars.com, does a great job moderating some of the stuff, and also with the real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:15:07.912 --> 02:15:10.253]  So tell me how I maximize my tweeting, sir.
[02:15:11.593 --> 02:15:15.154]  Well, you know, I run that wtfroy.com site.
[02:15:15.194 --> 02:15:18.555]  You retweeted a lot of stuff that David Amber Lyon was on.
[02:15:18.655 --> 02:15:20.956]  And, you know, just little things like that, you know, little quotes.
[02:15:22.216 --> 02:15:28.401]  Very specific things that are relevant to exactly what you need to convey at that point.
[02:15:28.841 --> 02:15:41.432]  Just by putting that out there on Twitter, so many people come across that because Twitter is completely, you know, it's sprawled in so many different directions and just the searchability of that and the SEO would really
[02:15:42.423 --> 02:15:47.207]  You know, help spread it in completely new directions for people that don't even, have never heard of you.
[02:15:47.748 --> 02:15:53.133]  Well, we also, and they've been doing that, we need to have the graphics department with simple political statements send out images.
[02:15:53.993 --> 02:15:55.455]  We need to do that more on Facebook.
[02:15:55.495 --> 02:16:00.820]  Facebook makes you pay now, if you're big, to send it out to people so, you know, we have millions so we can't even really use it.
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:03.962]  It's all about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:16:04.302 --> 02:16:10.106]  We need you guys to help us because, you know, I can be seen by hundreds of millions on YouTube.
[02:16:10.166 --> 02:16:12.287]  I can be all over national TV shows.
[02:16:12.788 --> 02:16:14.949]  I can be on 140 AM and FM stations.
[02:16:15.009 --> 02:16:15.890]  I can be on XM.
[02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:16.810]  The list goes on and on.
[02:16:17.251 --> 02:16:19.852]  But we need to get that Twitter up to a million people.
[02:16:20.333 --> 02:16:23.695]  And it's Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:16:24.555 --> 02:16:26.637]  And I guess we need to create a at
[02:16:27.117 --> 02:16:30.960]  Alex Jones, Twitter somehow, because I've been told that by everybody.
[02:16:31.561 --> 02:16:32.222]  So you're right.
[02:16:32.242 --> 02:16:33.323]  Any other points, sir?
[02:16:34.664 --> 02:16:43.271]  Well, basically, one way I think you could really do it is by tweeting at a specific group of people, multiple of them at one time with one specific article in the headline.
[02:16:43.812 --> 02:16:48.956]  And you never know, you know, if they read it, they might actually discuss it with some of their friends.
[02:16:48.996 --> 02:16:50.557]  You know, they were actually... No, no, I agree.
[02:16:50.597 --> 02:16:54.321]  Sometimes if I send, like Dave Mustaine this morning,
[02:16:55.253 --> 02:16:59.196]  Was just asking me if I'm getting feedback from him tweeting as to his millions of people.
[02:16:59.236 --> 02:17:01.057]  And I'm just so busy, I don't even have time.
[02:17:01.077 --> 02:17:03.419]  We need to be tweeting to Dave Mustaine, Billy Corrigan.
[02:17:03.439 --> 02:17:08.243]  We need to be tweeting to, you know, people like Joe Perry of Aerosmith.
[02:17:08.263 --> 02:17:09.664]  We need to be tweeting to Charlie Sheen.
[02:17:09.724 --> 02:17:11.285]  I've never even tried to get him to send out a tweet for me.
[02:17:11.305 --> 02:17:12.105]  He's got 8 million.
[02:17:12.366 --> 02:17:13.306]  I just don't think about it.
[02:17:13.727 --> 02:17:15.528]  I need to, I mean, I use it and like it.
[02:17:15.548 --> 02:17:16.829]  I just don't think about making it big.
[02:17:16.869 --> 02:17:17.910]  I'm starting to do that now.
[02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:21.252]  I need to get Man Cow to tweet stuff for me.
[02:17:21.312 --> 02:17:24.013]  I need to get Joe Rogan, you know, to tweet to him.
[02:17:24.034 --> 02:17:25.254]  We've tweeted before and he's tweeted us.
[02:17:25.995 --> 02:17:28.596]  So yeah, we need to really do it that way.
[02:17:28.997 --> 02:17:29.857]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:17:29.957 --> 02:17:31.478]  More, more golden ideas, sir.
[02:17:31.498 --> 02:17:31.778]  Tell me.
[02:17:33.119 --> 02:17:45.227]  Basically, the last thing that I think is, is, is you take all that and you start tweeting at people, like I said, a group of three, four, five people at a time, these celebrities, and those get retweeted so many times just by their followers.
[02:17:45.706 --> 02:17:47.647]  And that's how you can start really spreading it.
[02:17:48.047 --> 02:17:49.368]  I agree.
[02:17:49.448 --> 02:17:52.790]  We're going to send a tweet, but I need to write this.
[02:17:52.930 --> 02:18:00.994]  Something like, uh, Bob Costas, why are you lying to people about guns?
[02:18:02.350 --> 02:18:09.297]  And then send it to him, to NBC Sports, to a bunch of others, and then attach to it an article we're doing.
[02:18:09.757 --> 02:18:15.743]  Bob Costas, why are you lying and saying athletes don't protect themselves with guns or something like that?
[02:18:16.184 --> 02:18:19.667]  And then get people to notice that he's lying about this.
[02:18:19.707 --> 02:18:20.448]  That's a great idea.
[02:18:22.754 --> 02:18:30.220]  Right, so the last thing is that, you know, I also usually quote you a couple times a day.
[02:18:30.581 --> 02:18:46.133]  I put one out there today about the KKK article and I think that, you know, if you start tweeting certain things and then you put those in your articles, you can embed it so that, you know, rich content and it takes you directly to that person's account or it takes you to your account so they can follow you right there.
[02:18:46.594 --> 02:18:51.378]  You know, just putting it in front of people's face right then and there will at least make
[02:18:52.156 --> 02:18:57.761]  How much more likely for them to click it, you know, to follow you and spread that information that way?
[02:18:59.062 --> 02:19:09.491]  No, you're right, and we need to go after these celebrities that are promoting Satanism and, you know, pushing all sorts of stuff and get people debating what they're saying, what they're doing.
[02:19:10.228 --> 02:19:15.755]  Because I'm the master of being able to put out a YouTube video on a news piece and have a million views of it when other people can't get that done.
[02:19:16.215 --> 02:19:20.660]  I need to be able to dominate this Twitter thing because that's the new email and I know that.
[02:19:21.041 --> 02:19:26.026]  And people can go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and they can sign up there on the site.
[02:19:27.107 --> 02:19:30.528]  Uh, and they can, uh, then get the free magazine, the digital version.
[02:19:30.548 --> 02:19:31.969]  They can get key alerts and things.
[02:19:32.749 --> 02:19:34.249]  Uh, but people sign up for it.
[02:19:34.289 --> 02:19:42.792]  We use a big establishment email system to make sure there's no spam and they'll be lazy and they'll hit the spam button to delete my email instead of delete.
[02:19:42.872 --> 02:19:46.413]  And then, and then, you know, it causes problems.
[02:19:46.453 --> 02:19:50.694]  So I gotta get away from this email thing because I try to give people a free magazine.
[02:19:50.714 --> 02:19:53.395]  They sign up for it and they're like, I don't want your free magazine.
[02:19:53.415 --> 02:19:53.835]  You know, it's,

[02:22:23.035 --> 02:22:28.860]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic any time.
[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:33.864]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:22:34.224 --> 02:22:36.866]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:22:37.106 --> 02:22:42.209]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[02:23:04.738 --> 02:23:08.861]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:09.521 --> 02:23:11.643]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:12.543 --> 02:23:20.889]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:26.433]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:23:54.021 --> 02:24:00.970]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:24:01.271 --> 02:24:02.272]  Protect your immune system.
[02:24:02.552 --> 02:24:03.574]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:20.203 --> 02:24:24.866]  Coming up in the next segment, I'll get to that situation in Chicago with a dog getting shot.
[02:24:25.066 --> 02:24:25.987]  And that's one issue.
[02:24:26.027 --> 02:24:27.948]  Then the cops saying, don't talk to the media.
[02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:30.689]  North Korea, man.
[02:24:31.330 --> 02:24:32.551]  North Korea.
[02:24:34.192 --> 02:24:35.813]  Had it happen to one of my reporters last week.
[02:24:35.853 --> 02:24:37.434]  Don't take photos of the federal building.
[02:24:38.094 --> 02:24:38.914]  We'll take you to jail.
[02:24:38.974 --> 02:24:39.475]  It's illegal.
[02:24:39.535 --> 02:24:42.176]  I went down there yesterday and said, you know it's not illegal.
[02:24:42.196 --> 02:24:43.377]  And I went in there and confronted them.
[02:24:44.198 --> 02:24:45.278]  People are like, man, you're crazy.
[02:24:45.298 --> 02:24:45.979]  They'll come get you.
[02:24:46.079 --> 02:24:46.599]  Fine.
[02:24:47.219 --> 02:24:49.401]  I'm not a narcotics trafficking New World Order.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:55.303]  I'm a good guy, man, and I'm no tyranny when I see it, and we need to get government back under control.
[02:24:55.323 --> 02:24:58.045]  Now, that's what America's all about, not where it's going.
[02:24:58.646 --> 02:25:01.188]  Will in Texas says school districts are spying.
[02:25:01.308 --> 02:25:02.348]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:02.549 --> 02:25:05.751]  They openly have the 6th and 7th graders spy on their parents.
[02:25:05.811 --> 02:25:08.233]  They've got cameras in the bathrooms now.
[02:25:08.253 --> 02:25:09.453]  The Defense Department runs them.
[02:25:09.954 --> 02:25:11.255]  I mean, this country's far gone.
[02:25:11.535 --> 02:25:12.816]  Will, tell us what you discovered.
[02:25:16.058 --> 02:25:16.719]  Come ahead, Will.
[02:25:16.759 --> 02:25:18.360]  You're on the air worldwide right now.
[02:25:20.168 --> 02:25:20.668]  Yes, hello.
[02:25:20.708 --> 02:25:21.509]  Good evening, Alex.
[02:25:22.049 --> 02:25:22.309]  Good.
[02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:23.650]  Go ahead and tell us what's happening, sir.
[02:25:25.091 --> 02:25:37.460]  Well, here in Houston, there are... Let's just say they federalized the school, the schools, as well as the teachers.
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:49.388]  Now, a few months ago, you had a special showing how the police and others were giving kids, you know, young adults,
[02:25:50.163 --> 02:25:54.226]  Drugs, drugs of their choice in exchange for spying.
[02:25:55.887 --> 02:25:58.449]  Well, they're doing the exact same thing with the teachers.
[02:25:58.690 --> 02:26:04.274]  And by the way, people, I've got to hear this, people didn't believe it when a major capital reporter in Minneapolis, St.
[02:26:04.294 --> 02:26:06.836]  Paul, who's broken big stories, broke it here.
[02:26:07.356 --> 02:26:13.181]  And then a month later, or three weeks later, the governor, all of them, it came out, the state police were running it.
[02:26:13.541 --> 02:26:16.143]  Yes, they run the drugs in most cities.
[02:26:16.583 --> 02:26:17.084]  Unbelievable.
[02:26:17.104 --> 02:26:17.924]  Tell us what else happened.
[02:26:18.305 --> 02:26:18.545]  Tell us.
[02:26:19.625 --> 02:26:36.197]  Well, to make a long story short, and I would like to give you guys my information later to where we can talk more because it's one of those things I'd have to explain all of it for any of it to make sense, but I've been approached by FBI, by Homeland Security, and by CIA.
[02:26:37.719 --> 02:26:43.483]  The later of which was a gentleman from the CIA about a month ago just literally showed up at my house.
[02:26:44.444 --> 02:26:47.066]  And told me that they were going to make my life a living hell.
[02:26:47.627 --> 02:26:53.372]  Okay, so you discovered they're putting the kids on not just their Ritalin and Prozac, but on their Schmack and Coke and the rest of it.
[02:26:53.392 --> 02:26:54.052]  Is that what happened?
[02:26:55.033 --> 02:26:55.454]  No, no, no.
[02:26:55.474 --> 02:26:58.756]  What I've discovered is that they are putting the teachers themselves.
[02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:03.300]  They are giving the teachers cocaine.
[02:27:03.821 --> 02:27:08.545]  They are giving the teachers marijuana in exchange for
[02:27:10.091 --> 02:27:10.531]  Spying.
[02:27:10.631 --> 02:27:13.413]  The teachers themselves are spying on people.
[02:27:13.453 --> 02:27:15.675]  It's not just the kids anymore with the computers.
[02:27:16.135 --> 02:27:17.576]  They're using the teachers.
[02:27:40.131 --> 02:27:45.094]  Because they were told exact stuff like you're saying, and they wouldn't do it.
[02:27:45.215 --> 02:27:52.680]  I mean, they would do some hardcore stuff overseas, because they thought they were fighting communists, but they brought them back here to do incredible stuff.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:58.283]  In fact, with one family member, it was deal drugs and kill people in Chicago.
[02:27:59.364 --> 02:28:03.247]  Army officer who they wanted to sheep dip, and he was older too, and he wouldn't do it.
[02:28:03.327 --> 02:28:04.988]  But I mean, it's just so incredible.
[02:28:05.688 --> 02:28:06.349]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:07.512 --> 02:28:16.699]  Well, in particular, what I would like to do is give you guys the hard facts, but that's something I'm going to have to do shortly at another time.
[02:28:17.039 --> 02:28:18.260]  Well, just give us a rundown.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:19.081]  What's going on?
[02:28:19.121 --> 02:28:20.622]  How did you discover this?
[02:28:22.163 --> 02:28:30.410]  Well, basically, on Facebook, this woman just out of the blue sent me a message.
[02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:32.431]  She's a drop-dead gorgeous woman.
[02:28:34.227 --> 02:28:38.551]  So, we talked through Facebook for about a week and a half.
[02:28:38.571 --> 02:28:40.773]  Sure, they use sex operatives.
[02:28:40.793 --> 02:28:43.375]  Oh man, and check this out.
[02:28:44.596 --> 02:28:47.979]  She worked about two blocks down the street from my house.
[02:28:49.545 --> 02:28:50.166]  Coincidence?
[02:28:50.306 --> 02:28:50.926]  I think not.
[02:28:51.266 --> 02:29:05.937]  Now the strange thing is that there were times when I would pray about these matters and I would ask my subconscious to give me a sign whether or not this woman was a spy and one time she called me from school
[02:29:06.989 --> 02:29:11.250]  And the phones actually start to gain this interference.
[02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:20.532]  And I could actually hear one of her supervisors, probably from some type of abusing center, talking to her and telling her what to ask me.
[02:29:21.572 --> 02:29:29.254]  And she started to pick up on the fact that the lines were getting crossed or something to that effect, and she hung up.
[02:29:29.674 --> 02:29:32.555]  But not before I could actually hear what these people were saying.
[02:29:32.995 --> 02:29:36.356]  Now, get this, the first night that we met,
[02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:44.958]  We met the day before I was to do a radio interview talking about specific technology that has been weaponized.
[02:29:45.498 --> 02:29:52.581]  Technology that Richard Hoagland has alluded to... Hold on, it's probably because of where you work, but you know, Houston is famously corrupt.
[02:29:52.621 --> 02:29:54.322]  Police execute people there in public.
[02:29:55.282 --> 02:29:56.182]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.663 --> 02:29:58.283]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.204 --> 02:30:01.925]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:06.042 --> 02:30:10.064]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

[02:31:12.683 --> 02:31:15.465]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:31:15.925 --> 02:31:18.267]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:31:18.727 --> 02:31:21.309]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:31:21.749 --> 02:31:24.751]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

[02:32:05.786 --> 02:32:11.249]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[02:32:11.569 --> 02:32:18.632]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[02:32:18.932 --> 02:32:21.374]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[02:32:21.674 --> 02:32:27.717]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[02:32:28.377 --> 02:32:31.140]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:38.068]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[02:32:38.308 --> 02:32:43.413]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[02:32:43.614 --> 02:32:49.280]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:51.701]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[02:32:51.941 --> 02:32:52.482]  ProPure.
[02:32:52.682 --> 02:32:58.685]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[02:32:59.526 --> 02:33:02.087]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:33:02.127 --> 02:33:02.768]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:02.808 --> 02:33:09.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.028 --> 02:33:23.373]  That has got to be one of the smoothest jazz riffs.
[02:33:23.433 --> 02:33:24.314]  That's jazz, isn't it?
[02:33:26.477 --> 02:33:30.463]  I just know what kind of music I like that I've ever heard.
[02:33:30.483 --> 02:33:32.386]  I just, I can never hear this enough.
[02:33:33.462 --> 02:33:35.583]  Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, dead at age 91.
[02:33:35.623 --> 02:33:51.447]  Dave Brubeck, a jazz musician who attained pop star acclaim with recordings like Take 5, that's this, and Blue Rondo a la Turk, died Wednesday morning at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut.
[02:33:52.327 --> 02:33:55.928]  Said his longtime manager, producer, conductor, Russell Gloyd.
[02:33:55.948 --> 02:33:59.109]  Brubeck was one day short of his 92nd birthday.
[02:33:59.969 --> 02:34:01.630]  He died of heart failure en route.
[02:34:02.637 --> 02:34:06.021]  A regular treatment with his cardiologist, said his manager.
[02:34:06.081 --> 02:34:09.505]  Well, hey, that's a life fully lived and put out some beautiful stuff.
[02:34:09.545 --> 02:34:14.631]  A great example of the power and the good side of humanity that we all need to try to reach for.
[02:34:15.152 --> 02:34:16.493]  Show happy trails, buddy!
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:21.022]  Chris, Alanis recommended we do that and did that liner.
[02:34:21.042 --> 02:34:24.864]  I think that's a nice little touch on the show instead of me just ranting and raving here.
[02:34:24.884 --> 02:34:30.288]  I want to run through these calls and I've got two reports I've got to get to along with a bunch of other news.
[02:34:30.308 --> 02:34:31.248]  We've got to move quick here.
[02:34:31.268 --> 02:34:34.130]  And we do have the big Joe Rogan.
[02:34:34.350 --> 02:34:35.811]  Best interview I've ever done with him.
[02:34:35.851 --> 02:34:36.592]  Usually he's live.
[02:34:37.132 --> 02:34:39.333]  Usually Joey Diaz is here yelling and screaming.
[02:34:40.314 --> 02:34:41.135]  Who is a great character.
[02:34:41.195 --> 02:34:44.357]  But this is an in-depth interview with Joe Rogan on a host of issues.
[02:34:45.879 --> 02:34:53.106]  We're going to air it, excerpts tomorrow on the radio and we are going to air the whole thing basically unedited.
[02:34:55.766 --> 02:34:59.289]  Very little editing on the nightly news tomorrow night.
[02:34:59.449 --> 02:35:03.692]  And tonight, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowarsnews.com.
[02:35:04.213 --> 02:35:08.056]  I'm going to call it, you know, basically a film because that's what it is.
[02:35:08.797 --> 02:35:16.443]  Ron Paul's speech augmented, upgraded with incredible videos, documentation, his farewell address, proof and documentation of everything he's saying.
[02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:27.244]  We're gonna premiere that tonight in Fall Wars Nightly News and now is the time to go pay $5.95 for a monthly trial membership and you get 10 memberships for $5.95, 59 cents a month.
[02:35:28.746 --> 02:35:31.909]  One username and passcode can be used by 10 people simultaneously.
[02:35:32.189 --> 02:35:36.513]  So create an e-card or just email and say, hey, I gave you a free membership to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:37.810 --> 02:35:38.571]  And they'll say, what's that?
[02:35:38.611 --> 02:35:40.472]  And they'll go, it's incredible information.
[02:35:40.512 --> 02:35:47.697]  Documentary films, nightly news show, video of Alex Jones' radio show, digital copy of the magazine each month.
[02:35:48.237 --> 02:35:50.539]  I mean, it's really first rate.
[02:35:50.899 --> 02:35:52.120]  We've really upgraded the site.
[02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:53.621]  Almost 10 years in operation.
[02:35:53.641 --> 02:35:55.342]  17 years of material.
[02:35:55.602 --> 02:35:56.783]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:56.843 --> 02:35:59.404]  Tonight, the Ron Paul film.
[02:35:59.464 --> 02:36:01.046]  I don't know what to call it yet.
[02:36:02.026 --> 02:36:05.007]  So I've got to go name it right after the show here.
[02:36:05.567 --> 02:36:07.068]  And then I've got to interview Lindsey Williams.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:12.609]  I'm going to just sit back for like 45 minutes and let him talk and just go through all the new data he's got.
[02:36:12.649 --> 02:36:15.730]  So that's tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:20.191]  So the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:25.613]  I know I've been talking about this over and over again, but you know, you heard the caller
[02:36:27.529 --> 02:36:46.421]  Call in, and I don't know if he's telling the truth or not, he sounds legitimate, but I remember when a prestigious, you know, I mean a reporter who's broken a lot of big news stories, got video with his undercover team of the police going and getting Occupy Wall Street demonstrators and offering them cocaine, heroin, marijuana, alcohol, whatever they wanted, to go stir up trouble.
[02:36:47.061 --> 02:36:49.983]  And delivering them back with drugs, bombed out of their brain.
[02:36:50.723 --> 02:36:54.746]  And it's like flashbacks, it makes me sick when I wasn't using drugs in high school.
[02:36:56.039 --> 02:36:57.761]  Uh, you know, I tried a few.
[02:36:57.841 --> 02:36:59.043]  I smoked marijuana.
[02:36:59.063 --> 02:37:00.645]  Made me feel like I was run over by a truck.
[02:37:01.786 --> 02:37:03.308]  And, you know, didn't really like it.
[02:37:04.330 --> 02:37:05.291]  Tried a few other things.
[02:37:05.511 --> 02:37:07.834]  Nothing floated my boat but chewing tobacco and beer.
[02:37:09.784 --> 02:37:19.049]  And then I watched cops deal drugs in Rockwall, Texas, and later the sheriff went to jail for it, flying in a bunch of stuff into the airport.
[02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:23.632]  And another police got caught selling drugs to the department itself, not just the sheriff's department.
[02:37:24.392 --> 02:37:31.576]  And, you know, there'd be cops in there and getting in lockers and drug dogs, and the cops would pull me over when I was riding with friends when I was like 14, 15.
[02:37:33.550 --> 02:37:37.337]  And, uh, you know, we're gonna search your car and blah, blah, blah, and watch your mouth.
[02:37:37.437 --> 02:37:42.607]  And I'd be like, you know, I, one of my friend's older brothers buys drugs from you.
[02:37:43.564 --> 02:37:49.025]  I knew people that dealt drugs in the richest county in Texas, the bedroom community of Dallas.
[02:37:49.606 --> 02:37:54.447]  So I just grew up water skiing with people and stuff where a cop car would even pull up and sell them drugs.
[02:37:54.787 --> 02:38:01.449]  All I knew is that I'm like 13 and the girls are 18 dancing around on ecstasy and I'm out there hanging out with the cool old kids.
[02:38:01.509 --> 02:38:04.109]  I just thought, you know, I just saw cops dealing drugs.
[02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:06.870]  Oh, the police have pulled up, let's get the drugs from them.
[02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:09.411]  I'm like, oh no, no, no drugs for me, you know.
[02:38:10.211 --> 02:38:12.474]  I'd be over it, you know, with my older friends.
[02:38:12.494 --> 02:38:16.618]  They'd go by and sell drugs to some, you know, 25-year-old trophy wife.
[02:38:16.678 --> 02:38:20.823]  And, you know, my 18-year-old buddy, go back in the bedroom with her for 10 minutes, come out laughing.
[02:38:20.843 --> 02:38:21.724]  Hey, let's go, Alex.
[02:38:21.784 --> 02:38:23.325]  Jump on the back of the motorcycle, you know.
[02:38:23.345 --> 02:38:25.228]  I mean, I had a lot of fun.
[02:38:25.468 --> 02:38:26.509]  I thought it was a lot of fun.
[02:38:26.769 --> 02:38:28.071]  Again, I wasn't into the drugs.
[02:38:28.191 --> 02:38:28.711]  I saw it.
[02:38:29.505 --> 02:38:30.346]  See, I'm ranting here.
[02:38:30.366 --> 02:38:31.406]  It's why I can never go to calls.
[02:38:31.766 --> 02:38:34.688]  It's just the government deals the drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:35.268 --> 02:38:36.269]  Stop being naive.
[02:38:36.289 --> 02:38:37.650]  It's a way to pack their prisons.
[02:38:38.430 --> 02:38:40.591]  And you think seven million people in prison?
[02:38:40.832 --> 02:38:43.813]  It's four and a half million currently in it, but seven million each year in and out.
[02:38:44.434 --> 02:38:45.634]  They're getting ready to double that.
[02:38:45.654 --> 02:38:47.015]  They're going to put everybody in jail.
[02:38:47.515 --> 02:38:49.777]  They're going to put you in jail for dog poop in your yard.
[02:38:50.037 --> 02:38:51.778]  That's mainstream news.
[02:38:52.098 --> 02:38:52.778]  Guys, type in
[02:38:54.099 --> 02:38:55.482]  Six years in prison, $100,000 fine.
[02:38:55.502 --> 02:39:01.471]  It's San Diego Herald-Tribune for washing your car.
[02:39:02.879 --> 02:39:04.680]  Just you've got to wake up where it's all over.
[02:39:05.101 --> 02:39:05.781]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[02:39:05.821 --> 02:39:07.182]  Sir, real quick, finish your story.
[02:39:07.482 --> 02:39:08.283]  We'll get your number.
[02:39:08.583 --> 02:39:09.464]  We'll give you our email.
[02:39:09.504 --> 02:39:11.245]  You can send us some documentation.
[02:39:11.525 --> 02:39:15.969]  If you do have bombshell info, they're gonna kill you if you don't go public with it all soon.
[02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:19.271]  That's the type of people that get killed or get set up if what you're saying is true.
[02:39:19.311 --> 02:39:21.813]  And, you know, we proved that up in Minneapolis-St.
[02:39:21.833 --> 02:39:22.073]  Paul.
[02:39:22.293 --> 02:39:26.897]  The police had a giant program drugging everybody and selling the drugs because they're drug dealers.
[02:39:27.850 --> 02:39:28.950]  And they need to prime the pump.
[02:39:28.970 --> 02:39:30.051]  They need to get new customers.
[02:39:30.611 --> 02:39:31.531]  That's what drug dealers do.
[02:39:31.551 --> 02:39:34.152]  I mean, they push Prozac, Ritalin, and deadly vaccines on your kids.
[02:39:34.632 --> 02:39:44.455]  And I'm not saying all departments do this, but Dallas, Texas, they've caught the entire detective force stealing drugs and framing people to take their property.
[02:39:44.975 --> 02:39:48.196]  They've caught the Houston police doing it in a fake crime lab.
[02:39:48.216 --> 02:39:53.098]  They've caught Chicago, New York, L.A., San Francisco, Tulea, Texas.
[02:39:53.198 --> 02:39:54.438]  I mean, just every town.
[02:39:56.459 --> 02:39:57.760]  Almost every town, okay?
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:03.241]  And you've always got the goody two-shoe cop who wonders why he's been on the force 20 years and never moves up.
[02:40:03.501 --> 02:40:04.801]  Because you're a joke to them.
[02:40:04.841 --> 02:40:05.742]  They're drug dealers.
[02:40:06.822 --> 02:40:07.182]  Okay?
[02:40:07.302 --> 02:40:09.423]  I mean, I don't know how to explain it to you.
[02:40:09.823 --> 02:40:12.583]  But cops pull you over and say, got any drugs in the car?
[02:40:12.603 --> 02:40:14.264]  And I'm like, you sell drugs!
[02:40:15.930 --> 02:40:16.671]  Leave me alone!
[02:40:17.511 --> 02:40:30.542]  And boy, once I started talking about it, oh, we're gonna kill you, oh, we're gonna, they would pull me over and just, once I was 16, and would say, you are drinking, and when I wasn't, we're taking you to jail, you, or we'd pull up in a bonfire.
[02:40:31.303 --> 02:40:32.924]  I wasn't even drinking, I'd just gotten there.
[02:40:33.685 --> 02:40:35.687]  Okay, you're being disorderly, Jones.
[02:40:35.707 --> 02:40:36.607]  We're taking you to jail.
[02:40:37.028 --> 02:40:46.075]  And then, again, through a lawyer, we were told, you know, they kill people in Rockwall, and they told us a few people they'd hung in the jail, and they said, your son's going to be hung in the jail.
[02:40:46.436 --> 02:40:48.778]  My dad sold his dental offices when we moved to Austin, Texas.
[02:40:48.818 --> 02:40:50.679]  So, that's why I hear this stuff.
[02:40:50.819 --> 02:40:53.642]  It really upsets me.
[02:40:53.802 --> 02:40:57.385]  Because your naivete, America, is going to let total evil take over.
[02:40:58.510 --> 02:41:01.372]  Because it's not enough the government deals drugs, they deal little kids, too.
[02:41:02.093 --> 02:41:03.434]  You think Penn State's anything?
[02:41:03.474 --> 02:41:06.757]  That's normal in the circles of the elite, okay?
[02:41:07.518 --> 02:41:08.238]  Do you understand that?
[02:41:08.759 --> 02:41:12.122]  Now, let's go back briefly to Will in Texas.
[02:41:12.162 --> 02:41:12.702]  Go ahead, Will.
[02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:19.428]  You know, like I said, it sounds strange, but two things.
[02:41:19.528 --> 02:41:21.110]  First of all, I'm a reverend.
[02:41:21.846 --> 02:41:22.466]  Here in Houston.
[02:41:23.067 --> 02:41:24.768]  Oh, that doesn't sound strange.
[02:41:25.108 --> 02:41:27.510]  COINTELPRO spies on all pastors.
[02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:30.272]  Even if they work for the system, they've got operatives.
[02:41:30.332 --> 02:41:38.618]  Of course they wanted to get you up with a sex operative so they could blackmail you and fully control you and have you go under clergy response.
[02:41:38.658 --> 02:41:40.159]  They were just trying to get you as an operative.
[02:41:40.679 --> 02:41:41.220]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:42.360]  It gets worse.
[02:41:42.541 --> 02:41:48.645]  The first night I met her, and remember, she pushed the issue before my radio interview.
[02:41:49.285 --> 02:41:57.048]  The first night I met her, she got naked in a car, in her car, in the AHA parking lot.
[02:41:58.129 --> 02:41:59.089]  The first night.
[02:41:59.129 --> 02:42:03.571]  Oh yeah, the government runs the hookers, the escorts most times.
[02:42:03.671 --> 02:42:03.991]  I know.
[02:42:04.871 --> 02:42:05.151]  I know.
[02:42:05.651 --> 02:42:09.373]  And believe me, man, they've even landed a black helicopter on top of my house.
[02:42:10.509 --> 02:42:14.975]  Well listen, if what you're saying is true and you sound like you're telling the truth, you're in a lot of danger.
[02:42:14.995 --> 02:42:18.279]  You need to send us an email with all the information now, the names, everything.
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:20.703]  And they do spy on everything we do, so just understand that.
[02:42:21.023 --> 02:42:24.828]  But you need to understand that you need to go public with this or they'll kill you.
[02:42:25.529 --> 02:42:28.611]  And if you do go public, they'll leave you alone.
[02:42:29.071 --> 02:42:29.792]  Okay?
[02:42:30.052 --> 02:42:32.514]  Put him on hold, get his name and number, and we'll try to help him if we can.
[02:42:32.994 --> 02:42:42.000]  Yeah, most of these big city preachers have got a string of hookers running them, and sex operatives, and they've got a lot of the pastors running the drugs for them.
[02:42:42.641 --> 02:42:47.004]  I mean, they've got to have the pastor stand down when the government's snatching kids out of the congregation.
[02:42:50.626 --> 02:42:51.727]  People are so naive.
[02:42:52.707 --> 02:42:54.529]  Michael, no, we don't have time to go to calls yet.
[02:42:55.265 --> 02:42:56.706]  I'm going to have to skip this network break.
[02:42:56.746 --> 02:42:57.767]  I've got to quit doing this.
[02:42:57.907 --> 02:42:58.848]  I'm so out of control.
[02:43:01.611 --> 02:43:03.412]  This is our little satire piece.
[02:43:03.492 --> 02:43:06.095]  It's up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:43:06.115 --> 02:43:07.496]  Please help us get it out to everybody.
[02:43:07.536 --> 02:43:08.717]  It's in the featured news section.
[02:43:09.197 --> 02:43:12.820]  Breaking Bin Laden raid footage released by White House satire report.
[02:43:13.421 --> 02:43:19.987]  And it's got like a cartoon part, because you're going to hear the audio, where it shows a cartoon with Bin Laden's head on it with Predator drones dropping bombs on him.
[02:43:20.027 --> 02:43:20.687]  It's really funny.
[02:43:21.808 --> 02:43:29.253]  But then it goes into all the documentation that the Bin Laden raid was fake, it's all a fraud, and we should rename the new film to Zero Dark Easter Bunny.
[02:43:29.293 --> 02:43:32.555]  Here is that report with Melissa Melton and Jakari Jackson.
[02:43:33.615 --> 02:43:36.257]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:43:37.037 --> 02:43:44.181]  Zero Dark Thirty, the film supposedly based on the true story official accounts of the killing of Osama Bin Laden, is set to release in U.S.
[02:43:44.221 --> 02:43:45.602]  theaters December 19th.
[02:43:47.503 --> 02:43:49.905]  We are still no closer to defeating our enemy.
[02:43:52.217 --> 02:43:53.759]  20 detainees recognize that photo.
[02:43:57.903 --> 02:44:08.335]  In analyzing the clip you just saw, Jessica Chastain stars as CIA operative Maya, a woman obsessed with capturing the man supposedly behind the September 11th terrorist attacks.
[02:44:08.715 --> 02:44:13.921]  The New York Film Critics Guide was apparently so moved, they named Zero Dark Thirty Film of the Year.
[02:44:14.818 --> 02:44:18.181]  Now let's analyze a clip of actual Osama Bin Laden raid footage.
[02:44:18.861 --> 02:44:23.705]  Infowars.com has acquired this official White House approved raid footage.
[02:44:24.045 --> 02:44:28.489]  So we bring to you now the world premiere of the Osama Bin Laden raid.
[02:44:37.325 --> 02:44:37.866]  Zero to R30.
[02:44:37.906 --> 02:44:38.606]  I've seen the trailer.
[02:44:38.646 --> 02:44:41.949]  Looks like a made-for-TV movie.
[02:44:42.029 --> 02:44:42.790]  Uh, low budget.
[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:44.611]  The government produced this whole thing themselves.
[02:44:44.631 --> 02:44:48.454]  They already tell people what to do, but now they want to run it and be the movie stars themselves.
[02:44:48.474 --> 02:44:49.395]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:44:50.299 --> 02:44:52.520]  We can't be sure if that's legitimate footage or not.
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:59.463]  You see, so much misinfo and disinfo came out in the wake of the raid that it's really hard to understand what's real or what's not anymore.
[02:45:00.104 --> 02:45:04.046]  And really, shouldn't the makers of Zero Dark Thirty be concerned about the same thing?
[02:45:04.506 --> 02:45:10.168]  If you'll recall, Osama Bin Laden was supposedly taken down in a raid at a compound in Abbottabad in 2011.
[02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:17.092]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[02:45:17.372 --> 02:45:19.153]  President Obama addressed the nation.
[02:45:20.071 --> 02:45:28.492]  late Sunday evening to say that just hours before Osama bin Laden had been killed in the middle of a major populated city in a palace compound.
[02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:40.194]  My friends, this is a complete and total hoax, and we predicted with total precision, with inside sources, going back more than eight years ago, exactly what would happen.
[02:45:40.635 --> 02:45:45.218]  Then Bin Laden's body was buried at sea, all within 24 hours after the raid.
[02:45:45.438 --> 02:45:54.805]  Our government claimed his burial was per Islamic tradition, but many Muslim scholars have come forward to point out that this, like so much else in the official story, is false.
[02:45:55.706 --> 02:46:11.698]  Over the years, many people, from intelligence analysts to heads of state, including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and former FBI head of counterterrorism Dale Watson, have gone on record to say that bin Laden died in 2001.
[02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:16.857]  Dr. Steve Pichinik, who has worked with five different U.S.
[02:46:16.938 --> 02:46:26.934]  presidents and the Department of Defense, has even come out to say that Osama bin Laden died in 2001 of Marfan syndrome, a degenerative genetic disease with no permanent cure.
[02:46:27.779 --> 02:46:46.110]  With the intel, with the CIA reports you were reading, with as much proof as you can give us without giving up your sources, of knowing that Bin Laden was dead, and when he reportedly died, so that we can look at the big news story now in context of why they've launched this hoax today.
[02:46:47.196 --> 02:46:53.921]  Well, let me just say, the issue of why he was dead, it was exactly what I said before.
[02:46:53.961 --> 02:46:55.543]  He died of Marfan Syndrome.
[02:46:56.203 --> 02:46:56.844]  Bush Jr.
[02:46:56.864 --> 02:46:57.524]  knew about it.
[02:46:57.584 --> 02:46:59.466]  The intelligence community knew about it.
[02:46:59.526 --> 02:47:04.110]  He had El-Zawahiri, who was a physician with him, who is still a physician.
[02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:05.290]  I don't know where he is.
[02:47:05.671 --> 02:47:07.492]  But we knew he was already dead by 9-11.
[02:47:08.726 --> 02:47:20.582]  In fact, two separate high-level sources have told Alex Jones directly that not only was Bin Laden dead since 2001, but his death would not be announced until the most politically opportune moment.
[02:47:21.103 --> 02:47:24.888]  This all came out right at the time.
[02:47:26.243 --> 02:47:31.786]  That Obama's approval rating was dropping like a rock, an all-time low, this far into a president's administration.
[02:47:32.166 --> 02:47:40.730]  As the dollars dropping, as support for Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and the drone attacks in Pakistan was imploding.
[02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:44.172]  Right as the Pakistanis were threatening to kick the U.S.
[02:47:44.252 --> 02:47:46.013]  out of Pakistan and to kick their drones out.
[02:47:46.353 --> 02:47:50.335]  Right as this happens, there's this big propaganda victory, and what do they do?
[02:47:51.331 --> 02:47:53.993]  They take the body and throw it in the ocean.
[02:47:54.114 --> 02:47:55.595]  They say, do you really believe that?
[02:47:55.735 --> 02:47:56.896]  No one is buying that.
[02:47:57.436 --> 02:48:04.783]  When the announcement finally came that Osama bin Laden was dead, the White House changed its story so many times, it was hard to keep anything straight.
[02:48:05.123 --> 02:48:07.605]  First, the raid involved a 40-minute shootout.
[02:48:08.266 --> 02:48:09.647]  Then, there was no shootout.
[02:48:09.968 --> 02:48:12.330]  Then, only one unnamed man was armed.
[02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:14.311]  Then Bin Laden was armed.
[02:48:14.731 --> 02:48:19.433]  Then he wasn't armed, and it was reported that he used his wife as a human shield.
[02:48:19.833 --> 02:48:32.599]  To go along with the ever-changing official story, the White House also released a Situation Room photo depicting a grave President Obama and Hillary Clinton with her hand over her mouth, supposedly watching the Bin Laden raid live.
[02:48:33.279 --> 02:48:40.883]  But CIA Director Leon Panetta later admitted that wasn't possible, as the live feed had been cut before the Navy SEAL team even went in.
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:51.702]  Speaking of the Navy SEALs that carried out the raid, controversy intensified when our government announced that some members of SEAL Team 6, responsible for the raid, died in a helicopter crash two months later.
[02:48:52.342 --> 02:49:05.505]  I have two sources inside the Army, and I have another source inside the Marines, a colonel, who have confirmed and talked to members of the family of SEAL Team 6 that supposedly was shot down a few days ago.
[02:49:06.645 --> 02:49:16.196]  Over Kabul, Afghanistan, that they were killed to shut them up about what they know about the staged raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound.
[02:49:16.556 --> 02:49:21.121]  In the wake of the raid, Disney even tried to copyright the name Navy SEAL Team 6.
[02:49:22.475 --> 02:49:25.956]  The Situation Room photo wasn't the only photo proven a fraud, either.
[02:49:25.976 --> 02:49:34.659]  A photograph the media pounced all over in the days following the raid, reportedly of Bin Laden's body, was also shown to be a manipulated fake.
[02:49:35.339 --> 02:49:38.160]  Multiple books were also released following the raid.
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:46.602]  The latest one published by a Navy SEAL who claimed his work was a first-hand, boots-on-the-ground account, and that he witnessed Bin Laden's death with his own eyes.
[02:49:47.303 --> 02:49:50.804]  The publisher even claimed the book was not vetted by the Pentagon.
[02:49:51.684 --> 02:50:00.311]  But as we witnessed with the arrest and detainment of Brandon Robb, release of an unapproved book of this magnitude would garner a full-scale assault on its author.
[02:50:01.592 --> 02:50:02.432]  So let's recap.
[02:50:02.512 --> 02:50:10.699]  Ten years later, and the greatest manhunt in history as the movie puts it, and we finally caught and killed the man responsible for one of the greatest crimes ever committed on U.S.
[02:50:10.739 --> 02:50:14.962]  soil, and yet we have no valid photographs and no conclusive proof.
[02:50:16.405 --> 02:50:20.627]  If you want a conspiracy theory to exist, that's how you start it.
[02:50:22.267 --> 02:50:28.810]  The most elusive character on the face of the planet, the most elusive human being, the Bigfoot of people.
[02:50:29.610 --> 02:50:36.953]  And you catch him and kill him, but yeah, we chucked him in the drink right away, because we didn't want any more problems.
[02:50:37.369 --> 02:50:50.501]  The latest news to break on the Bin Laden raid came a few weeks ago, when heavily redacted emails obtained through an Associated Press FOIA request revealed that no American sailors aboard the USS Carl Vinton had witnessed Bin Laden's sea burial.
[02:50:51.061 --> 02:50:57.607]  Another email from the Public Affairs Officer claimed that only a small group of the ship's leadership were even informed of the burial.
[02:50:58.137 --> 02:51:12.476]  Though the release of Zero Dark Thirty was delayed until after the presidential election, supposedly to ward off accusations of a political agenda, with a mountain of evidence showing we've never been given the full story here, it's hard to think this movie has anything but a political agenda.
[02:51:13.391 --> 02:51:17.935]  So much propaganda was released following the Bin Laden raid, it's unclear what really happened.
[02:51:18.375 --> 02:51:26.281]  But saying this movie is based on a true story is a lot like saying Winnie the Pooh is based on a real life bear named Winifred and a real life little boy named Christopher Robin.
[02:51:26.681 --> 02:51:29.784]  And yet, I've never seen one talking tiger in real life.
[02:51:30.364 --> 02:51:32.666]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Melton.
[02:51:35.208 --> 02:51:36.469]  Alright, great job Melissa.
[02:51:39.690 --> 02:51:42.412]  You know, it's even worse than what she says, though.
[02:51:42.812 --> 02:51:44.433]  And that's what happens every time I do a report.
[02:51:44.693 --> 02:51:47.395]  It's always much worse than what we can even add to it.
[02:51:48.515 --> 02:51:49.796]  That's what's so terrible about it.
[02:51:50.256 --> 02:51:51.397]  People think I exaggerate.
[02:51:51.417 --> 02:51:53.138]  Most of the time, it's not exaggeration.
[02:51:53.618 --> 02:51:54.959]  It's that I'm underestimating.
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:03.765]  Because the White House is on record being involved in giving classified information, classified baloney.
[02:52:04.605 --> 02:52:09.108]  Advisors, the Pentagon, this is the most integrated film
[02:52:10.786 --> 02:52:11.266]  We're good to go.
[02:52:40.114 --> 02:52:43.316]  But they're not that slick where Nazi Germany did that with films.
[02:52:43.476 --> 02:52:47.238]  Hitler was a master and Joseph Goebbels of having the films push the regime.
[02:52:48.659 --> 02:52:51.701]  Product placement, propaganda placement, they call it behavior placement.
[02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:55.483]  I coined the term propaganda placement 15 years ago when there was no term.
[02:52:57.064 --> 02:53:01.747]  And you add all the rest over 10 billion a year that we know about for paying the media.
[02:53:02.748 --> 02:53:03.749]  It's one of the biggest secrets.
[02:53:03.789 --> 02:53:10.113]  A lot of big talk stations on radio and TV have sponsored news, and you're never told that.
[02:53:10.193 --> 02:53:11.314]  We don't have sponsored news.
[02:53:11.614 --> 02:53:13.295]  Sometimes we have sponsors on, occasionally.
[02:53:13.795 --> 02:53:20.160]  Pretty much rarely, but, you know, where they have some info we want, and it's like 90% of it's not an infomercial, but there is some of that in it.
[02:53:20.220 --> 02:53:22.261]  We don't do infomercials for more than a few minutes.
[02:53:22.281 --> 02:53:28.165]  All radio does that, but, you know, when you're like an hour and it's a sponsor, it's because they're an interesting person, and then they're a little bit about their thing at the end.
[02:53:28.325 --> 02:53:29.666]  But we're transparent about that.
[02:53:29.706 --> 02:53:30.246]  It's obvious.
[02:53:30.627 --> 02:53:31.828]  I always say, this is our sponsor.
[02:53:33.028 --> 02:53:42.172]  Uh, they'll announce when News Corp reports on a Fox, you know, story or something, or when Fox reports on that, they'll tell people, we're reporting on our parent company.
[02:53:42.472 --> 02:53:47.655]  But when the government is involved paying off radio hosts, TV hosts, it's all come out.
[02:53:48.195 --> 02:53:50.296]  Just unbelievable amounts of money.
[02:53:50.996 --> 02:53:52.337]  And they were keeping it secret.
[02:53:54.062 --> 02:53:59.415]  Remember when it came out with Bush paying half a million to this guy, two hundred and forty something thousand to that guy?
[02:54:00.116 --> 02:54:03.243]  But the media only focused on personalities being paid.
[02:54:06.601 --> 02:54:07.422]  Let's shift gears.
[02:54:07.942 --> 02:54:26.821]  We've been trying to feature stories here where police do the right thing, where cops, you know, buy a guy a pair of shoes and it's not a PR stunt, or where, because we know it's not a PR stunt with the case in Albany, New York, with our reporters going up there, our auxiliary reporter Jason Burmess, and they tell, you know, the cop to throw him out, and he goes, well, he's not interfering.
[02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:27.842]  Well, give me his license.
[02:54:27.862 --> 02:54:29.484]  Well, I can if he isn't doing something wrong.
[02:54:32.348 --> 02:54:34.830]  And by the way, that police officer did not get reprimanded.
[02:54:34.850 --> 02:54:36.511]  He got commended by that Sheriff's Department.
[02:54:36.531 --> 02:54:38.052]  That sounds like a pretty good Sheriff's Department.
[02:54:38.873 --> 02:54:44.756]  I mean, look, just don't treat law-abiding citizens like scum and tell us we're in North Korea and can't do stuff when you're not interfering.
[02:54:45.257 --> 02:54:48.859]  Sure, you can't go back in the checkpoint and get into what they're doing, but you can be back there filming.
[02:54:48.879 --> 02:54:49.600]  They're filming you.
[02:54:51.281 --> 02:54:55.003]  So we try, and we're looking for good things police are doing, okay?
[02:54:55.023 --> 02:55:01.628]  Because we want to model good behavior and not just be one-sided bashing police here because that compacts cops more into their gang culture.
[02:55:03.166 --> 02:55:15.103]  But I've seen countless videos and I've done reports on this before going to people's houses where cops busted in a no-knock raid for marijuana or whatever and didn't find it in one case I covered.
[02:55:15.484 --> 02:55:17.266]  The lab is in the kitchen.
[02:55:18.419 --> 02:55:18.799]  Chained
[02:55:35.726 --> 02:55:38.708]  You know, a hostage call or something, and they're gonna kill my Chihuahua?
[02:55:38.728 --> 02:55:39.888]  They'll kill my French Bulldogs?
[02:55:40.188 --> 02:55:42.049]  I know they'll kill French Bulldogs, because they look scary.
[02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:44.210]  That's a joke, but it's not.
[02:55:44.450 --> 02:55:47.132]  People on hike and bike trail, you know, they weigh like 25-30 pounds.
[02:55:47.552 --> 02:55:47.652]  Oh!
[02:55:47.852 --> 02:55:48.953]  They just see a bulldog.
[02:55:49.713 --> 02:55:51.234]  And this was a bull terrier.
[02:55:51.294 --> 02:55:52.154]  Really sweet dog.
[02:55:52.194 --> 02:55:52.794]  It did live.
[02:55:52.834 --> 02:55:53.495]  It's out of the vet.
[02:55:54.335 --> 02:55:57.177]  The police admit the dog walked out behind the guy when they were giving him a ticket.
[02:55:57.357 --> 02:56:00.238]  And when they shot his dog, they still gave him the ticket in Chicago.
[02:56:00.518 --> 02:56:01.459]  But here's the big story.
[02:56:02.583 --> 02:56:08.606]  Now, and this is a Fox piece we're about to play a clip of here, now the police came to try to intimidate the owner.
[02:56:09.027 --> 02:56:10.107]  Here's a clip of that right now.
[02:56:10.127 --> 02:56:14.250]  He was covered in blood and he said, the cop shot the dog.
[02:56:15.996 --> 02:56:17.577]  A Fox 32 exclusive tonight.
[02:56:17.637 --> 02:56:22.139]  A Northside family furious over what they claim was an unjustified police shooting.
[02:56:22.439 --> 02:56:23.119]  Good evening, everyone.
[02:56:23.159 --> 02:56:24.059]  I'm Robin Robinson.
[02:56:24.199 --> 02:56:25.020]  And I'm Bob Sarat.
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:28.161]  The shooting happened Saturday in a quiet residential neighborhood.
[02:56:28.301 --> 02:56:31.843]  The dog was off the leash, but its owners say it never posed a threat.
[02:56:32.183 --> 02:56:35.944]  Now the owners say they are getting heat from police for telling us their story.
[02:56:36.305 --> 02:56:39.386]  Fox 32's Larry Yellin is here with exclusive details tonight.
[02:56:39.426 --> 02:56:39.626]  Larry?
[02:56:39.986 --> 02:56:55.332]  Bob and Robin, residents of the Northside Buena Park neighborhood are still upset tonight, not just because police shot the puppy they all knew as the Colonel, but also because the shooting occurred not far from a preschool on a street where pedestrians, including children, could have been hurt.
[02:56:57.788 --> 02:57:06.917]  Meet Colonel Phillips, a seven-month-old miniature bull terrier whose father was a champion show dog and whose owners hoped one day would be a show dog himself.
[02:57:07.277 --> 02:57:09.099]  They look like Spuds Mackenzie.
[02:57:09.839 --> 02:57:10.980]  You see in a Target ad?
[02:57:11.661 --> 02:57:12.102]  One of those.
[02:57:12.742 --> 02:57:13.463]  But they're miniatures.
[02:57:13.643 --> 02:57:17.266]  But on Saturday afternoon, the colonel became a target himself.
[02:57:17.346 --> 02:57:23.290]  He was shot by a Chicago police officer in front of his owner's gated north side home.
[02:57:23.330 --> 02:57:30.056]  Police were writing a parking ticket for a van belonging to Al Phillips, the dog's owner, so Phillips came out to move the vehicle.
[02:57:30.376 --> 02:57:33.118]  My little bull terrier followed me out.
[02:57:34.139 --> 02:57:36.841]  Boom, boom, two shots.
[02:57:39.215 --> 02:57:40.015]  You shot the dog.
[02:57:40.355 --> 02:57:48.398]  One eyewitness, Charlene Dezagle, told us she heard the officer warn Phillips about the dog being loose, but the officer never sounded like he was in danger.
[02:57:48.578 --> 02:57:51.679]  All of a sudden I heard him say, get your dog!
[02:57:51.859 --> 02:57:54.580]  And then the next statement was, get your dog.
[02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:57.941]  And then he just pulled out his gun and shot twice.
[02:57:58.341 --> 02:58:01.962]  Morgan Phillips, Al's daughter, rushed the dog to an emergency vet.
[02:58:02.364 --> 02:58:03.905]  He needed a five-hour surgery.
[02:58:03.925 --> 02:58:06.647]  They took shrapnel out of his stomach.
[02:58:07.127 --> 02:58:09.549]  He had a shell casing in his leg.
[02:58:09.569 --> 02:58:12.030]  It lacerated the muscle.
[02:58:12.390 --> 02:58:14.272]  We were going to show him, but we can't now.
[02:58:14.552 --> 02:58:18.494]  While I interviewed the dog's owners, I saw two police officers drive by.
[02:58:18.735 --> 02:58:23.738]  Ninety minutes later, they were back, asking Phillips why he had contacted the media.
[02:58:24.238 --> 02:58:27.981]  And then giving Phillips a ticket for not keeping the Colonel on a leash.
[02:58:28.121 --> 02:58:28.841]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:29.022 --> 02:58:30.222]  That's enough, folks.
[02:58:30.443 --> 02:58:32.004]  This is the mafia thuggism.
[02:58:32.344 --> 02:58:33.084]  Hey, bud!
[02:58:33.325 --> 02:58:35.526]  Hey, Mac, why'd you call the media when we killed your dog?
[02:58:35.866 --> 02:58:40.730]  You're not just getting a ticket for the car, you're getting a ticket now for the dog off a leash.

[03:01:05.046 --> 03:01:13.413]  It's like the cops in Chicago are like, you don't, we shot your dog for no reason, here's a ticket for it, and you don't talk to the media, scum!
[03:01:13.653 --> 03:01:15.634]  What do you think this is, America, you filth?

[03:01:38.881 --> 03:01:41.923]  Once you catch $2,000 in a fines, yes!
[03:01:42.543 --> 03:01:45.944]  Oh, government, nothing will stop us, nothing will stop us.
[03:01:46.304 --> 03:01:47.265]  Everything is ours now.
[03:01:48.085 --> 03:01:49.065]  Oh, it's so good.
[03:01:49.666 --> 03:01:54.827]  Oh, and in Chicagoland, Godfather orders mourners to be searched and patted down at funerals.

[03:01:57.808 --> 03:01:58.928]  No one can be trusted.
[03:01:58.948 --> 03:02:01.049]  I saw this video days ago.
[03:02:01.229 --> 03:02:01.949]  RT covered it.
[03:02:02.489 --> 03:02:03.749]  It's gone super viral.
[03:02:03.869 --> 03:02:04.450]  NSA.
[03:02:04.570 --> 03:02:07.030]  Everyone is under surveillance in the United States.
[03:02:07.050 --> 03:02:08.811]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[03:02:08.871 --> 03:02:09.851]  It's so wonderful.
[03:02:09.911 --> 03:02:10.971]  Just total tyranny.
[03:02:11.051 --> 03:02:12.752]  Absolutely running rampant everywhere.
[03:02:13.312 --> 03:02:14.453]  Oh, but everything's fine.
[03:02:14.473 --> 03:02:15.554]  The government loves you.
[03:02:15.975 --> 03:02:20.559]  And then there's also mainstream news admitting up at Infowars.com the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[03:02:21.279 --> 03:02:25.823]  Aircraft Carrier Task Force ready to back up Al-Qaeda and bring them in.
[03:02:26.724 --> 03:02:27.625]  So it's all happening.
[03:02:28.146 --> 03:02:33.350]  And Glenn Beck, Ben Savant to launch reality TV show.
[03:02:34.031 --> 03:02:35.332]  So there you go.
[03:02:37.405 --> 03:02:38.865]  That is very, very good.
[03:02:38.905 --> 03:02:40.046]  So we have stuff like that.
[03:02:40.066 --> 03:02:42.446]  That's exactly how I've been offered so many reality TV shows.
[03:02:42.466 --> 03:02:43.867]  I'm not in competition with Glenn Beckman.
[03:02:44.367 --> 03:02:51.368]  I mean, it's just any reality TV show that's controlled by mainstream media will make you look bad.
[03:02:51.688 --> 03:02:54.149]  I mean, there is, and take you out of context, there is no doubt.
[03:02:55.149 --> 03:02:56.590]  So that's just some of the news up there.

[03:03:43.742 --> 03:03:44.002]  as well.
[03:03:44.022 --> 03:03:44.963]  That's why they run Al-Qaeda.
[03:03:45.263 --> 03:03:46.745]  They'll use Al-Qaeda to take our liberties.
[03:03:46.785 --> 03:03:47.446]  That's how it works.
[03:03:47.946 --> 03:03:50.269]  Breaking Bin Laden raid footage released by White House.
