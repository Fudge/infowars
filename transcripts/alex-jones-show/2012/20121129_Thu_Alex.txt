[00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:13.906]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:15.367]  You want answers?
[00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:17.028]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:21.310]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:41.846]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live!
[00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:51.551]  It is Thursday, the 29th day of November 2012, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:58.574]  You can see a detailed list of the guests we have on today up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the top right-hand corner.
[00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.315]  But Josh Abraham
[00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:12.351]  The son of the co-author of None Dare Call It Conspiracy, Gary Allen and Larry Abraham, the quintessential primer to understand the New World Order, first published, what, in 1971?
[00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:17.713]  The book that really crystallized my awakening to a great extent.
[00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.976]  You can't say one thing woke me up, or any of us up, but it's a process generally.
[00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:27.744]  One son started Politico and runs it, Gary Allen's son.
[00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.389]  Larry Abraham's son, Joshua Abraham, is going to be joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.516]  He is a former pro wakeboarder and a former sponsored snowskier.
[00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:43.099]  He's been researching his father's work in depth for quite a while.
[00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.660]  The book was out of print.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.245]  There's, I don't know, over like 10 million of them out there until lately, and we found folks that have republished it.
[00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:54.192]  And so we're the only place you can really get it is at InfoWareStore.com, but that's a side issue.
[00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:54.913]  None there.
[00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:57.351]  Call it conspiracy.
[00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.732]  He's going to break some news that his father told him on his deathbed.
[00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.553]  And these guys were hooked in with Congressman Larry McDonald.
[00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:09.174]  They were hooked in with the Patriot Movement in Congress.
[00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:17.575]  And I mean, they laid out in this short little, I don't know what is it, 130 page book, the entire battle plan from 1971.
[00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:18.396]  And guess what?
[00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:19.676]  Almost all of it came through.
[00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.837]  It all came through exactly like they said they would up to a point.
[00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.737]  We haven't gotten to the final endgame yet.
[00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:31.710]  And his dad also wrote a book called The Greening about Agenda 21 before it even had that name.
[00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:39.636]  So just trailblazers amongst trailblazers, real insiders.
[00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:46.341]  So we're going to learn about what he told him on his deathbed and why he contacted us coming up today.
[00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:51.785]  Should be interesting, to say the least.
[00:02:53.348 --> 00:03:01.291]  And then Gar Smith, who wrote Nuclear Roulette, the truth about the most dangerous energy source on Earth.
[00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:02.851]  And again, I've never been anti-nuclear.
[00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:06.112]  These companies run these things now until they melt down.
[00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:10.034]  90, what is it, 2% of them, according to the U.S.
[00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:14.595]  Energy Department they admit, worldwide, of the 400 plus reactors worldwide, most of them here in the U.S.
[00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:19.117]  or a lot of them, about half of them, technically France has got a lot too, so does Japan, are leaking.
[00:03:20.043 --> 00:03:25.767]  Yeah, now they just announced, you know, earlier this year when they had leaks in Southern California at a big reactor that he said, you know what?
[00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:29.130]  We're going to turn the alarms off now in the city that have been scaring people.
[00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:34.517]  We're not going to tell you anymore when we're off-gassing radiation.
[00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:36.818]  I'm against nuclear now.
[00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:37.959]  Let's just get that clear.
[00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:50.686]  It's like I'm for the death penalty, but you can't trust a corrupt government to implement it when they're known to frame people en masse and know they're sending people to the gas chamber or to lethal injection.
[00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:54.789]  They're totally innocent.
[00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:59.412]  I can't support the death penalty as it stands because criminals run the government.
[00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.182]  It's the same thing with nuclear.
[00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:07.484]  They won't ever deploy the new, safer technology, and they've just decided that radiation is not bad for us.
[00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:09.804]  So, that is coming up in the third hour.
[00:04:09.844 --> 00:04:11.804]  We'll open the phones up coming up in the next segment.
[00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:12.545]  I'll give the number out.
[00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:14.345]  There is so much news.
[00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.445]  We told you this was coming.
[00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:23.747]  Look, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and others, they financed both Obama and Romney because they have an agenda.
[00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:32.340]  And we get caught up in Romney and Obama, Bush, Clinton, all this stuff, George W., Senator Kerry.
[00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:35.283]  They are front men.
[00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:36.825]  They're front men.
[00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:38.567]  You know, they're like presidents of companies.
[00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.309]  Usually CEOs actually run things.
[00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.933]  And then presidents go to the PR functions and are the spokespeople.
[00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:45.675]  Well, that's what our presidents have become.
[00:04:46.935 --> 00:04:48.416]  And they're corporate frontmen.
[00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:50.057]  Teleprompter readers.
[00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.078]  And they're saying they're gonna increase taxes.
[00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:54.379]  They're not just income tax.
[00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.101]  VAT, national sales taxes, and carbon taxes.
[00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:01.622]  Get ready, they're coming for us.
[00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:09.040]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.221]  Don't be one of them!
[00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:15.864]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:25.650]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.494]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:33.994]  We're good to go.
[00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:14.645]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:18.706]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:25.969]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[00:06:40.256 --> 00:06:45.358]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:47.279]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.261]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:56.023]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[00:06:56.203 --> 00:07:00.524]  800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:07:05.945 --> 00:07:10.826]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:14.306]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:17.147]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.127]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:23.608]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:28.730]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.430]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.031]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:07:35.632 --> 00:07:39.393]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:07:39.873 --> 00:07:43.014]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:46.676]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.958]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:55.201]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.803]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:01.425]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:16.176]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:21.737]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:33.306]  Yes, my friends, it is the 29th day of November 2012.
[00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:50.440]  And I am seeing a lot of criticism on our YouTube channel and in comments at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and the stories.
[00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:52.503]  Not a ton, but still quite a bit.
[00:08:52.924 --> 00:08:58.091]  People are genuinely, some people, a small minority, are genuinely mad.
[00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:12.462]  That I don't believe there's going to be a pole shift or sea levels rising by 50 feet or more, some are saying hundreds of feet, on December 21st and that I think the whole thing is absolute baloney.
[00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:21.549]  And according to a lot of you out there, in 22 days from now, 23 days from now, we're all dead or close to it.
[00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.074]  And I just do not believe that and I guarantee you
[00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:31.643]  That I will be not exonerated when this doesn't happen.
[00:09:31.763 --> 00:09:36.106]  I will be hated even more by people that have bought into this ideology of end of the world.
[00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:42.930]  My problem with this end of the world stuff is there's always a new one.
[00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.911]  2000, 2001, Planet X was going to kill us.
[00:09:45.131 --> 00:09:49.514]  Or, you know, the Navy and the Army put out that Y2K was going to shut everything down.
[00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:50.795]  They created that hype.
[00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:54.417]  And when people bought into it, my listeners bullied me.
[00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.251]  And convinced me.
[00:09:56.351 --> 00:10:00.697]  I mean, I said it was all baloney for a year until the last month and said, oh, looks like it may be real.
[00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:08.066]  And I will not be bullied into saying that December 21st, 2012 is the end of the world, so.
[00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:18.111]  We're going to open the phones up again today in between the guests we've got coming up if you want to call in and give me your take on this.
[00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:20.712]  I'm not saying the globalists don't believe in the occult.
[00:10:21.272 --> 00:10:23.653]  I'm not saying that they aren't digging in and building bunkers.
[00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:26.674]  I'm not saying that the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider
[00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:46.692]  Couldn't create a black hole or a particle, they call a strangelet, that basically creates something like a black hole that falls to the center of the Earth, the area of greatest gravitational pull and mass, and then starts pulling matter into it, and then creates a gravity well, and the whole Earth implodes in on itself.
[00:10:47.752 --> 00:10:51.394]  Uh, to a much smaller size, basically, killing all life on the planet.
[00:10:51.874 --> 00:11:09.623]  Many top physicists we've had on and have been in the news, and people with major degrees, people that have made proven discoveries, have said that they're doing thousands of tests at Hadron, and that the probability is that it's a low probability that one experiment will destroy the Earth, but if they do thousands,
[00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:13.385]  They don't know what's going to happen and now they're discovering new types of matter.
[00:11:14.245 --> 00:11:16.406]  They say they're discovering new particles.
[00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:24.089]  They say that Japan and the United States have created black holes in laboratories, artificial suns, in the last 30 years.
[00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.073]  This has been done hundreds of times we know about.
[00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:30.995]  And that's projects they're telling us about.
[00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:36.540]  So I'm not saying that the establishment couldn't destroy the earth.
[00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:45.429]  I'm not saying some super weaponized human pox based on mouse pox that kills over 98% of mammals that it's tailored to.
[00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:49.833]  You can make it for rabbits, you can make it for sheep, you can make it for humans, you can make it for rhesus monkeys.
[00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:51.694]  Now, you can make it quite easily.
[00:11:51.714 --> 00:12:02.242]  Remember, about seven years ago, it was big news when scientists in Australia released the DNA sequencing on how to make it for any mammal.
[00:12:03.143 --> 00:12:05.364]  And there was a big debate about should this have been released.
[00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:08.247]  Obviously, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:13.531]  But humans are creators, and humans cannot help
[00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:15.544]  Investigating.
[00:12:15.564 --> 00:12:17.685]  I mean, I've plugged this probably a hundred times.
[00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:18.426]  I'll plug it again.
[00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.567]  It still airs occasionally on Discovery Channel.
[00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:23.548]  It's Trinity and Beyond, narrated by William Shatner.
[00:12:23.968 --> 00:12:31.892]  And again, I knew everything basically in that film, because I've read quite a few books on the atomic and the nuclear and hydrogen age.
[00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:36.875]  I find cyclotrons and nuclear piles and atomic piles and
[00:12:37.675 --> 00:12:43.158]  And superconducting, super colliders, just absolutely riveting information.
[00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:52.384]  Space-based weapons, x-ray lasers, smart pebble, particle beams, other directed energy weapon systems.
[00:12:53.504 --> 00:13:00.348]  I have sought out the former head of Star Wars, interviewed him many times, Colonel Bob Bowman, Dr. Bowman, physicist, engineer.
[00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:05.311]  But I understand that, well, going back to the Shatner
[00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:10.313]  We've got that documentary, we ought to pull the clip and play it.
[00:13:11.093 --> 00:13:25.536]  The United States alone, hundreds of times, detonated high-powered hydrogen bombs in the 60s, and there's film of this, in the atmosphere, in the edge of space, trying to blow a hole in the atmosphere to see if they could destroy the Earth's atmosphere.
[00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:27.076]  Let me say that again.
[00:13:27.096 --> 00:13:32.917]  They tried to blow a hole in the atmosphere so that the atmosphere could be sucked into space.
[00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:36.448]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:40.113]  They tried to blow up the Van Allen radiation belt too.
[00:13:40.873 --> 00:13:45.739]  They actually made it more radioactive.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.202]  More than half the scientists at Los Alamos
[00:13:49.394 --> 00:14:04.438]  I thought that when they detonated the first A-bomb secretly ahead of bombing Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, half the scientists or more believed it was going to ignite the Earth's atmosphere and burn the atmosphere off.
[00:14:05.424 --> 00:14:09.185]  And they had underground bunkers with their own oxygen generators and things they were ready to go into.
[00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:13.645]  So it's all about the power trip of these people.
[00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:14.446]  Yeah, there's the headline.
[00:14:14.746 --> 00:14:18.786]  Large Hadron Collider Won't Destroy Earth With Planet-Eating Black Hole.
[00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:23.567]  Court says, despite the fact a bunch of top physicists tried to block it.
[00:14:24.147 --> 00:14:28.708]  And then just two days ago they come out in the New Scientist and say, oh, we're making new matter.
[00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:30.088]  New heavy matter.
[00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:31.709]  Oh, heavy matter.
[00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.749]  Oh, really?
[00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:39.049]  Max Planck equations from 1900 envisioned exactly how atomic bombs would work.
[00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:40.954]  Oh, we're 2012, folks.
[00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:42.498]  It is Buck Roger time.
[00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.451]  So, don't get me wrong.
[00:14:47.452 --> 00:15:03.846]  I'm not saying that the establishment might not destroy us all in their... Well, I've got the quotes of some of the top physicists on the Manhattan Project bragging about how we would sit around drinking gin, saying we'd become gods, we'd become, you know, Sheba, the god of destruction.
[00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:06.128]  And there's recordings of that where they've done the interviews.
[00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:08.614]  You can pull that up.
[00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:12.655]  A bunch of them sitting around, like, grinding their teeth with these stars in their eyes.
[00:15:12.675 --> 00:15:15.396]  And these are guys with, you know, 180, 200 IQs.
[00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:16.596]  Idiot savant types.
[00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:19.617]  But they're missing something.
[00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:21.597]  It's the Ring of Mordor.
[00:15:22.118 --> 00:15:23.178]  They can't help but use it.
[00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:24.538]  So, let me get this straight here.
[00:15:25.398 --> 00:15:31.440]  I'm not saying that we couldn't destroy ourselves, and it becomes a probability the longer we go down this path.
[00:15:32.913 --> 00:15:42.123]  I'm simply saying the Mayan prophecy, A, doesn't say what the media says it says, that it's the end of the world, or that an asteroid's gonna hit us, or a comet, or the sun's gonna blow up.
[00:15:42.324 --> 00:15:42.984]  Doesn't say that.
[00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:48.471]  B, I don't believe even if they said that I wouldn't put stock in it.
[00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:55.985]  But the establishment is digging in like it is the end of the world.
[00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:58.127]  Yeah, guys, you found a Scientific American article.
[00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:04.955]  X out of that photo there for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, and I'll actually read them the headline there.
[00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:06.596]  Yeah, go ahead and punch it back up for people.
[00:16:06.997 --> 00:16:10.741]  High-altitude nuclear explosions dangerous, but not for the reasons
[00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:13.429]  Genrich sites.
[00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:14.389]  What is that about?
[00:16:14.429 --> 00:16:21.591]  Newt Genrich has been warning the nation of the danger of an electromagnetic pulse, EMP, a burst of radiation creating a high-altitude nuclear explosion.
[00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:26.212]  The pulse would take down electrical systems, and then they go on to say that's not the issue.
[00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:29.753]  That's a separate article.
[00:16:29.773 --> 00:16:31.293]  You guys are looking up what I was talking about.
[00:16:31.313 --> 00:16:41.235]  But I mean, look, the point is these mad scientists run around tinkering with the genetic code of every major plant species, animal species, cross species.
[00:16:42.674 --> 00:16:45.695]  And it's already created disastrous results.
[00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:57.039]  And then they lecture us all day how we need to pay carbon taxes and shut off half our energy supply, 51%, 52% of it, because coal is bad, even though it goes through all these filters.
[00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:59.500]  All that comes out is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.822]  But they have George Mambiot, the big globalist, come out and say, radiation's good for us.
[00:17:05.082 --> 00:17:06.303]  I believe in nuclear power.
[00:17:07.023 --> 00:17:09.006]  And let's have more disasters, basically.
[00:17:09.046 --> 00:17:09.867]  Bizarre statements.
[00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:12.370]  Well, they do that just to throw it in your face and acclimate you.
[00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:19.720]  We're gonna arrest you if you wash your car in San Diego, six years in jail, $100,000 fine, if soap suds hit the gutter.
[00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:23.166]  Neighbors call on him giant, you'll get part of the fine.
[00:17:23.686 --> 00:17:25.807]  You'll get 25% of the $100,000 fine.
[00:17:26.107 --> 00:17:27.188]  Associated Press Reuters.
[00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:29.208]  I mean, off the chart authoritarianism.
[00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:33.490]  If your dog goes to the bathroom in the backyard, six years in jail, $100,000 fine.
[00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.451]  Second offense.
[00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:37.072]  First offense, what is it?
[00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:40.193]  Multi-thousand dollar fines, jail time if you don't pay it.
[00:17:41.253 --> 00:17:45.615]  I mean, your dog goes to the bathroom, your neighbor tattles, you're going to jail.
[00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:47.316]  And they will put you in jail!
[00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.252]  They built new prisons, that's our economy.
[00:17:50.933 --> 00:18:00.043]  But if you want to take every major food source and splice it with animals and pharmacological, they have thousands of pharmacological crops, thousands, in corn alone.
[00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:07.652]  You can make corn grow chemicals, you can make it grow live AIDS virus, HIV, you can make it grow anything you want.
[00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:21.535]  And the public is so Stone Age, every time I talk about this we get letters, we get calls, guys on the street will go, hey I hear your show, I like what you do, but I have a biology degree and you do not have, you cannot splice plants and animals.
[00:18:22.156 --> 00:18:25.178]  And I say to the people, when did you get your degree, oh 1976?
[00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:29.100]  In one case, and I went, are you a practicing biologist?
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.661]  No, I'm in real estate.
[00:18:32.498 --> 00:18:36.142]  Then don't come up and pat me on the shoulder hard and tell me I'm a liar.
[00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:40.526]  Because one time, I told the story at Conan's Pizza, the guy was like, hey, I don't like you lying.
[00:18:41.227 --> 00:18:42.488]  And I was like, about what?
[00:18:42.608 --> 00:18:47.172]  And then I told the guy, he started getting in my face, and I said, you just, you just, you just are on a power trip.
[00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.434]  You better get out of my face right now.
[00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:55.561]  See, these people want to say I'm a liar because they don't want to admit how scary this is.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.421]  Well, you know what?
[00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:59.223]  You live in your ignorance if you want, okay?
[00:18:59.903 --> 00:19:12.297]  I don't have a verbal repertoire, a semantical lexicon to deliver to you just how crazy things are.
[00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:16.113]  They say we're living in a boring world, you're crazy.
[00:19:16.593 --> 00:19:28.759]  By the way, the globalists in the 60s, Club of Rome and other publications that are public, you can pull them up, we show screenshots of them and the dates in Endgame, they say we've got to have a world government because of all these technologies that will emerge.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.761]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote about this in several of his books.
[00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:33.242]  He wrote in the 70s.
[00:19:34.442 --> 00:19:41.186]  But then they're the globalists who are handing all this out everywhere and blocking anyone that tries to stop it.
[00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:45.601]  Because you can stop these technologies because they affect other people.
[00:19:46.722 --> 00:19:47.922]  They get into other crops.
[00:19:48.102 --> 00:19:49.583]  They hurt people.
[00:19:49.903 --> 00:19:53.606]  So you can restrict them under a libertarian ideology of common sense.
[00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:55.106]  But the globalists aren't doing that.
[00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:57.428]  They want a global government to play God.
[00:19:57.448 --> 00:20:00.409]  They believe these technologies are going to deliver them to Godhood.
[00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.951]  And in the process, they're going to destroy us all.
[00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:11.367]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:14.769]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:17.450]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.371]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:20.832 --> 00:20:23.793]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:24.293 --> 00:20:28.839]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.522]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[00:20:32.043 --> 00:20:35.047]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:20:35.628 --> 00:20:39.332]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:42.917]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:46.480]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[00:20:47.521 --> 00:20:50.645]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:54.869]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:58.412]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:20:58.432 --> 00:21:00.074]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:10.922]  According to the FBI, close to 400,000 burglaries take place in the United States between November and December each year.
[00:21:11.142 --> 00:21:14.243]  Seems burglars shop for the holidays, too, for easy targets.
[00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:17.704]  Here are a few things that you can do to lower the risk of a break-in.
[00:21:17.984 --> 00:21:18.985]  Lock doors and windows.
[00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:21.706]  Don't have newspapers and mail accumulate in front of your house.
[00:21:21.946 --> 00:21:25.887]  Don't announce your travel plans on social media and plug in fake TV.
[00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:27.267]  Burglars love the dark.
[00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:30.808]  Fake TV is a bit like a light on a timer but more convincing.
[00:21:31.008 --> 00:21:34.989]  Plugs into any outlet and simulates the colors and movement of a real TV.
[00:21:35.249 --> 00:21:38.630]  Burglars will see light and movement and likely move on to easier targets.
[00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.711]  Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:46.853]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays or anytime.
[00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:51.657]  So before you leave your house looking like an empty, easy target, order Fake TV today.

[00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:39.732]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:39.912 --> 00:22:45.616]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:45.736 --> 00:22:49.138]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:35.572]  I think.
[00:24:50.832 --> 00:24:52.754]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:24:53.255 --> 00:24:57.640]  Let me just fire out some of the top news stories right now, then we'll start taking your calls.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:10.413]  Coming up in the next segment ahead, I have two amazing guests that are going to be joining us, including the son of the co-author of None Dare Call a Conspiracy, Larry Abraham's son, Joshua Abraham, is going to be joining us.
[00:25:11.574 --> 00:25:15.638]  And he's going to tell us what his dad told him on his deathbed and some other breaking news.
[00:25:15.658 --> 00:25:20.041]  Let me tell you, these guys were real insiders with their connections in Congress.
[00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:23.764]  Gary Allen and Larry Abraham, both of them now deceased.
[00:25:24.144 --> 00:25:26.286]  Gary Allen, again, his son started Politico.
[00:25:27.367 --> 00:25:29.988]  Talk about joining the New World Order, but whatever.
[00:25:30.548 --> 00:25:34.009]  The other son is going to be speaking out here with us coming up.
[00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:36.670]  Larry Abraham's son coming up.
[00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:43.873]  Then we'll look at Nuclear Roulette, the author of that, looking at the real dangers of these nuclear reactors in the third hour.
[00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:46.374]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:25:51.175 --> 00:25:51.255]  800-259-9231.
[00:25:53.476 --> 00:26:10.823]  And just to plug here, your purchases at Infowarshop.com of water filters, books, videos, all of it, finances this truly alternative, next-level media that is challenging the dominant corporate, New World Order, state-controlled, banker-controlled media.
[00:26:10.863 --> 00:26:15.045]  So, you can get Nondare Call a Conspiracy with Gary Allen and Nuclear Roulette.
[00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:17.686]  Now, the gentleman that got the rights and republished
[00:26:18.706 --> 00:26:22.508]  Carol Quigley's book, Tragedy and Hope, and None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[00:26:22.908 --> 00:26:23.988]  He died of cancer.
[00:26:24.028 --> 00:26:28.150]  We were trying to get him on the show because he's somebody fighting the globalists for 60 years.
[00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:32.452]  He gave us a lot of good intel from the people he knew, but we were unable to get him on the air.
[00:26:32.472 --> 00:26:41.116]  He did just die of cancer before Thanksgiving, and we have the only books right now in stock of None Dare Call a Conspiracy, and also
[00:26:43.098 --> 00:26:51.466]  Uh, tragedy and hope with Carol Quigley, where he had, as an insider perspective, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown brags about the tyranny they're setting up.
[00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:52.887]  It's the size of a phone book, though.
[00:26:52.907 --> 00:26:57.111]  Uh, it's, I don't know how many pages, 1,200, 1,300, I haven't read it in years.
[00:26:57.552 --> 00:26:59.714]  Unbelievable quotes from their perspective.
[00:26:59.974 --> 00:27:01.015]  So we have those books.
[00:27:01.175 --> 00:27:02.136]  They may go out of print.
[00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:03.938]  If you want them, infowarestore.com.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.702]  We've got 500 None Dare Call It conspiracies and even less of the other.
[00:27:09.722 --> 00:27:11.662]  And it may go back into print, but we don't know.
[00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:15.144]  Okay, there is that news for you.
[00:27:15.164 --> 00:27:23.068]  I tell you, I may try to get the rights and republish it if None Dare Call It Conspiracy doesn't get reprinted, because it needs to be printed.
[00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.408]  It needs to be seen, especially.
[00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:28.470]  Because most people aren't going to read... How many pages of strategy do you hope I forget?
[00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.531]  Will somebody run one in there to me?
[00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:31.460]  I think it's over there on the bookshelf.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.625]  I want to be able to give people the accurate number on how long that baby really is.
[00:27:35.645 --> 00:27:39.108]  Okay, what is here in the stack in front of me?
[00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:48.238]  We have incredible medical tyranny articles where all over the country courts are now ruling to forcibly inoculate children without parental consent.
[00:27:49.358 --> 00:27:50.239]  They're just doing it.
[00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:54.462]  I mean, it's like court's ruling, we're going to take you and sterilize you because you come from a poor family.
[00:27:54.842 --> 00:27:59.045]  They did that until the 40s when Hitler gave eugenics a bad name, which it deserved.
[00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:05.270]  We've got a video of New Jersey professor angrily claims Stalin killed nobody.
[00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.213]  There's so many cuss words in this that I'm only going to play a short clip.
[00:28:09.873 --> 00:28:10.334]  It's 1,359 pages.
[00:28:10.394 --> 00:28:11.094]  There you go.
[00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:12.315]  1,359 pages is how long Tragedy and Hope is.
[00:28:18.635 --> 00:28:20.537]  And I gotta be honest, I didn't read the whole thing.
[00:28:20.877 --> 00:28:25.982]  I tried to read it twice, and I've probably read 500 pages of it, using the bibliography to read certain parts.
[00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:35.951]  But, I mean, you want the inside Bible and how they control the left and the right, how they're bringing in this total tyranny, how they want authoritarianism, how they want to end the family.
[00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:38.433]  You gotta read Tragedy and Hope, written in the early 1960s.
[00:28:41.021 --> 00:28:42.483]  Okay, side issue, side issue.
[00:28:42.523 --> 00:28:44.205]  This is not our opinion here.
[00:28:44.525 --> 00:28:44.945]  Okay?
[00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:46.307]  This stuff is not our opinion.
[00:28:46.347 --> 00:28:55.117]  These people think you're so stupid, they publicly, like an eco-science written by the White House Science Czar, admit they're putting stuff in your water to sterilize you and give you cancer.
[00:28:55.557 --> 00:28:56.919]  These are really uncool people.
[00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:01.042]  I mean, what's the worst thing a control freak can do?
[00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:01.762]  Poison you.
[00:29:02.043 --> 00:29:03.624]  And sit back and know they're poisoning you.
[00:29:03.864 --> 00:29:10.087]  And watch you become generationally dumbed down and your DNA damaged to create the self-fulfilling prophecy that you're garbage.
[00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:13.249]  And so many of these inbred elites end up in mental institutions.
[00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:15.750]  They're the ones with genetic disorders.
[00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:16.811]  They're the ones!
[00:29:17.331 --> 00:29:18.292]  You people are the scum!
[00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:20.671]  You people are the scum!
[00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.253]  The socialists, the Nazis, all of you people!
[00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:24.134]  I hate you!
[00:29:24.154 --> 00:29:25.215]  Excuse me.
[00:29:25.675 --> 00:29:28.718]  Alright, I'll come back, hit some of the economic news.
[00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:32.501]  A drudge report is hitting hardcore on mind control.
[00:29:33.282 --> 00:29:42.330]  They posted yesterday, our article, inmate James Holmes told me he was programmed to kill by evil therapists and right under it, posted an AP article
[00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.731]  On CIA mind control.
[00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:45.812]  It's back in the news.
[00:29:45.832 --> 00:29:49.675]  We're going to break that down after the... and the new taxes that are coming.
[00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:52.677]  The new loving taxes and Mitt Romney going to the White House.
[00:29:53.097 --> 00:29:53.817]  He's there right now.
[00:29:54.238 --> 00:29:55.138]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.639 --> 00:29:57.240]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.693 --> 00:30:07.456]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:09.438]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:30:09.718 --> 00:30:13.041]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:15.424]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:18.987]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:30:19.207 --> 00:30:25.013]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:28.657]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:30:28.977 --> 00:30:33.582]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:30:33.722 --> 00:30:39.448]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:40.770]  And here's the best news.
[00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.933]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[00:30:44.153 --> 00:30:47.957]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[00:30:48.077 --> 00:30:50.640]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.121]  I don't know.
[00:31:05.327 --> 00:31:15.517]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:26.187]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:34.452]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[00:31:34.673 --> 00:31:41.537]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[00:31:41.877 --> 00:31:46.299]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:53.984]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver, and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing,
[00:31:54.164 --> 00:32:04.036]  Please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever.
[00:32:04.537 --> 00:32:09.763]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:32:10.023 --> 00:32:12.225]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:32:12.445 --> 00:32:17.969]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.372]  And it's available discounted at Infowars.com.
[00:32:21.532 --> 00:32:24.735]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:32:24.995 --> 00:32:26.396]  There's no priming required.
[00:32:26.676 --> 00:32:28.718]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:32:28.938 --> 00:32:31.420]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:33.842]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:32:34.042 --> 00:32:35.323]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:32:35.463 --> 00:32:38.305]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.788]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:32:42.008 --> 00:32:45.991]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:48.752]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:32:48.893 --> 00:32:50.193]  It's what my family uses.
[00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:53.656]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:32:53.776 --> 00:32:59.020]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.161]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:07.803]  We are on the march.
[00:33:08.124 --> 00:33:10.605]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:16.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.727 --> 00:33:26.071]  I'm waiting in my cold cell When the bell begins to chime
[00:33:38.534 --> 00:33:48.079]  Because at five o'clock, they'd take me to the gallows pole.
[00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:50.740]  The sands of time for our Republic.
[00:33:59.465 --> 00:34:09.954]  But anytime we want, we can wake up to the globalist and to our basic God-given rights to not be slaves and stand up and declare our independence.
[00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:17.561]  But to defeat the evil, we must first admit it is there and recognize the good from the corruption.
[00:34:18.522 --> 00:34:22.766]  As for me, I choose the good and I will stand against the bad.
[00:34:24.702 --> 00:34:26.202]  All right, let me run through a bunch of headlines.
[00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:30.103]  Infowars.com's got a lot of police state news we're going to be getting to.
[00:34:30.123 --> 00:34:35.464]  But first, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, tax now, cut later.
[00:34:35.864 --> 00:34:44.206]  That means tax you now, lie to you, and not cut taxes later, or just cut taxes for the big mega banks that are already basically paying no taxes and are exempt.
[00:34:44.226 --> 00:34:45.106]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:34:45.486 --> 00:34:47.587]  Guantanamo inmates could be moved to U.S.
[00:34:47.787 --> 00:34:48.447]  jails.
[00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:52.148]  George Herbert Walker Bush hospitalized in Houston.
[00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:58.348]  Will President be in Hawaii when Nation goes over the fiscal cliff and they hold a sausage and pass new taxes?
[00:34:58.928 --> 00:35:02.069]  Obama's planned 20-day $4 million vacation.
[00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.451]  Biden goes to Costco after executives cozy up to White House.
[00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:08.852]  Shows ID to get in.
[00:35:08.912 --> 00:35:10.052]  Good little slave training.
[00:35:10.092 --> 00:35:10.953]  Y'all gotta show your ID.
[00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:17.063]  Syria shuts down the internet to fight the Western Al-Qaeda forces they're bringing in against them.
[00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:21.146]  And that is just some of the news right there.
[00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:25.048]  And if you go down to the bottom of DrudgeReport.com, it's now moved to the bottom.
[00:35:26.243 --> 00:35:28.906]  There is a report up there.
[00:35:29.387 --> 00:35:44.223]  Inmate Joker told me he was programmed by therapist and that is a InfoWars.com story that's via Denver Westworld News report.
[00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:50.706]  But notice what Drudge did, and Crewe, I should add, right over here.
[00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:58.910]  CIA sued over alleged 1953 murder of military scientists, and that's the headline out of the AP.
[00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.072]  I've interviewed Mr. Olson, who was thrown out of the balcony, murdered, the Army officer.
[00:36:04.392 --> 00:36:06.553]  I've interviewed his son, years ago, I want to get him back on.
[00:36:07.673 --> 00:36:14.476]  And he was criticizing the CIA secret drugging of the population with LSD and other things, so he skydived out of a window.
[00:36:15.097 --> 00:36:16.997]  And they're now suing over that.
[00:36:17.058 --> 00:36:24.141]  And of course, Sirhan Sirhan, the LAPD report said he didn't shoot Kennedy, it was a different caliber, that his arm was held down the whole time he fired into the wall.
[00:36:25.302 --> 00:36:27.744]  And that we know who the CIA operative was that shot him in the back.
[00:36:28.044 --> 00:36:32.687]  And we know who the four CIA operatives, including a section chief, were photographed in the ballroom.
[00:36:33.287 --> 00:36:36.410]  I mean, man, talk about... It's kind of like Dr. David Kelly said.
[00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.610]  They've told me they'll kill me.
[00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.692]  This, you know, happened when he exposed the WMDs.
[00:36:40.732 --> 00:36:41.593]  They had a U.N.
[00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:42.133]  inspector.
[00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:43.494]  He lived in England.
[00:36:43.835 --> 00:36:49.578]  Dr. David Kelly said, I've been told, he told this to hundreds of people in an email, I'll be killed if I don't shut up, but I can't help it.
[00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:51.380]  I was told I'll be found dead in the woods.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.044]  And then a hiker in the morning said five men in black uniforms ran away from the body they dropped.
[00:36:57.684 --> 00:37:03.729]  And they go up, wrist or slit, no blood at the site, three pills in his stomach, undigested, meaning he was dead.
[00:37:04.329 --> 00:37:05.810]  They trammed the pills down his throat.
[00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:08.572]  Post-mortem, they barely even slid down his esophagus.
[00:37:09.793 --> 00:37:11.334]  And there was no blood.
[00:37:12.075 --> 00:37:14.217]  And the coroner even said he was murdered.
[00:37:14.837 --> 00:37:17.439]  But they call you a conspiracy terrorist if you read the admissions.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.421]  So they can say, we're going to murder you
[00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:25.218]  Like, Diana shot a video in her diary, told her butler.
[00:37:25.838 --> 00:37:27.418]  I talked to her cook personally.
[00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:28.739]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:30.660]  The point is, that was off record, actually.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.460]  Just forget I said that.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.701]  Besides, you don't know which cook it was.
[00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:35.702]  The point is that it's on record they told a bunch of people.
[00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:45.386]  And you can pull up those articles that Diana said, Charles says he's going to kill me if I don't start dating this rich Arab.
[00:37:47.543 --> 00:37:51.587]  And then when she got pregnant, oh my goodness, you're dead.
[00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:53.949]  Of course, royalty never kills members of the family.
[00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:57.972]  They never lock people in the tower and smother little twins or anything.
[00:37:57.992 --> 00:38:06.780]  I mean, you know, Henry VIII, royalty never even, you know, the British royalty didn't knock off their cousins, the Tsars in Russia, even though it's admitted they did, funding the Bolsheviks.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.821]  I mean, none of that goes on.
[00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:08.542]  Everything's fine.
[00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:09.262]  Government loves you.
[00:38:11.047 --> 00:38:15.970]  But we're going to be getting into that report because mind control is real.
[00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:25.515]  And when you look at James Holmes, ladies and gentlemen, he was in a government mind control program and was paid a grant every year, his full salary and tuition.
[00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:29.358]  He was a salaried PhD student.
[00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:44.502]  And then a Pentagon Air Force psych warfare psychiatrist, the head of the entire San Antonio operation, is sent there and then he visits with her multiple times weekly and there's a big folder with him reportedly talking about doing it and the prosecutors don't want that in the trial.
[00:38:45.603 --> 00:38:50.988]  And they move to block it when the defense says that that's evidence that they knew and let him do it.
[00:38:52.189 --> 00:38:53.329]  I mean, unbelievable.
[00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.571]  And then you've got him telling
[00:38:55.865 --> 00:38:59.726]  The jail guards and police say, well he was never around other inmates to say this.
[00:38:59.986 --> 00:39:06.168]  But there's all the articles, we did a report on it last night, where they said that the inmates described him yelling and screaming for days on end, right next to him.
[00:39:06.448 --> 00:39:11.189]  That's on record, he was in general population, you know, in a cell around people.
[00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:23.012]  So, and then Tim McVeigh had Jolly and West, the known number two under Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:34.917]  Who they have history channel shows about, who they would get foster children, thousands of them, and reprogram them with drugs and audio recordings over a year, until they didn't even know who they were and had a new identity.
[00:39:35.177 --> 00:39:38.740]  And you could program children and teenagers, who they mainly grabbed.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:45.265]  They tried it with soldiers, but men just tend to break down under mind control, generally, unless it's high-tech drugs.
[00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:46.486]  Now they've even got chips.
[00:39:46.846 --> 00:39:48.728]  The point is, all of this is on record.
[00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:54.312]  When you're informed, people just say, oh, that's kooky, that doesn't exist.
[00:39:54.332 --> 00:39:59.253]  Despite people reporting tear gas being thrown, or flash bangs from both sides, all the rest of it.
[00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:06.756]  You know, the smoke bombs, people letting him in, on and on and on, the gun control bills, right at the time.
[00:40:07.316 --> 00:40:08.556]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:10.857]  Who shot Reagan?
[00:40:12.438 --> 00:40:13.178]  Go look that up.
[00:40:15.819 --> 00:40:16.839]  The guy that shot Reagan's.
[00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:23.197]  Father was CIA, was meeting with Jeb Bush and others the night before.
[00:40:23.237 --> 00:40:25.038]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:40:25.058 --> 00:40:26.139]  That's Denver Post, by the way.
[00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:28.981]  It goes on and on, Washington Times.
[00:40:29.762 --> 00:40:32.824]  On and on and on and on.
[00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:34.225]  And he said he was under my control.
[00:40:34.986 --> 00:40:39.989]  The guy that shot John Lennon.
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.750]  Oh, man.
[00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.731]  Just what's on record is incredible.
[00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:45.854]  And I wish
[00:40:48.052 --> 00:40:48.433]  Never mind.
[00:40:48.453 --> 00:40:50.016]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:40:52.995 --> 00:40:54.856]  Let me tell you about some of the other headlines we've got here.
[00:40:55.476 --> 00:41:01.059]  UN set to implicitly recognize Palestinian state despite US-Israel threats.
[00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:01.719]  That's Reuters.
[00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:05.821]  Egypt crisis raises fears of second revolution with a new dictator.
[00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:08.982]  Syrian authorities block internet and phone signals in rebel areas.
[00:41:09.062 --> 00:41:13.664]  Activists say they are communicating with contacts in Syria by using satellite telephones.
[00:41:13.685 --> 00:41:14.625]  Yeah, I wonder who gave you those.
[00:41:15.085 --> 00:41:16.986]  Again, I'm not for the Syrian government, but give me a break.
[00:41:17.026 --> 00:41:18.767]  Are governments using al-Qaeda against them?
[00:41:19.147 --> 00:41:20.808]  That is incredibly illegitimate.
[00:41:21.308 --> 00:41:28.889]  Of course, we've now got the TSA saying they don't have to go to a congressional hearing, that Congress doesn't have oversight over them, and we've got Obama saying the UN is over our military.
[00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:36.011]  I mean... Aspiring dictator Morrissey falsely claims 90% of Egypt stands by him.
[00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:38.071]  Incredible Infowars.com story.
[00:41:39.912 --> 00:41:43.052]  That's just some of what we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:46.573]  But let's go to your phone calls.
[00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.411]  Right now, before I go to this New Jersey professor saying Stalin didn't kill anybody.
[00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:56.072]  The Russian government declassified all the files that they killed.
[00:41:56.132 --> 00:41:58.893]  Ten million Ukrainians, probably conservatively under Stalin.
[00:41:59.373 --> 00:42:04.574]  Five million Poles just disappeared, worked to death, or shot.
[00:42:05.514 --> 00:42:11.816]  Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Sheltsin needs a Nobel Prize winner for literature, for non-fiction.
[00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:20.414]  I mean, just Stalin's purges on record of the entire military brass at least six times.
[00:42:23.316 --> 00:42:27.499]  Just Stalin is the second biggest mass murderer in history.
[00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:39.067]  It goes Mao, and then after that it goes Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, and then way down the line.
[00:42:39.087 --> 00:42:40.809]  I mean, these are all well-known numbers.
[00:42:41.897 --> 00:43:10.158]  Literally hundreds of major university studies, declassified, admissions, and... I've had communists on the streets recognize who I am in New York, going to the RNC to cover it and things like that, come up, get in my face, threaten me, and, well, we got it on video, and say they're glad Stalin killed people like me.
[00:43:11.397 --> 00:43:16.901]  And, and, and, I mean, that's in Police State, what is it?
[00:43:19.323 --> 00:43:21.424]  Martial Law 9-1-1 Rides the Police State.
[00:43:21.784 --> 00:43:22.525]  Three hour film.
[00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:27.108]  And I'm like, hey, you know, communism's bad.
[00:43:27.148 --> 00:43:32.632]  I mean, Stalin killed conservatively 30 million people during his reign.
[00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:33.493]  That's conservative.
[00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:34.093]  Good!
[00:43:35.374 --> 00:43:37.455]  Well, I mean, you think the government should take over and kill people?
[00:43:37.475 --> 00:43:38.116]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:40.158]  Yeah, I think it's good.
[00:43:40.938 --> 00:43:42.620]  And you hear the women going, yeah, they ought to kill you.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.323]  And of course, they're not going to kill anybody.
[00:43:45.363 --> 00:43:48.346]  If they got in control, they'll order the police and military to go do it.
[00:43:49.027 --> 00:43:51.810]  And the police and military will say no, and they'll kill their entire leadership.
[00:43:53.925 --> 00:43:57.866]  And then the next round of cops will grudgingly do it, and then they'll still take your family too.
[00:43:58.547 --> 00:44:01.227]  By the way, this is going to happen if we don't stop these people.
[00:44:01.528 --> 00:44:02.648]  I don't think you understand.
[00:44:02.988 --> 00:44:16.913]  I've analyzed the entire attack profile of the globalists in country after country and what they're setting up here, and they're going to shut everything off if they think they can get away with it, incrementally in a stair-step fashion, imploding the economy, grabbing more power in the name of fixing it, more taxes.
[00:44:17.173 --> 00:44:23.315]  Shut the economy down more, implode it more, gauge that, give money to their friends, keep everybody in line, implode it more.
[00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:28.432]  Until they find a class of government bureaucrats that will do anything.
[00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:33.114]  And they're going to put you in jail for dog poo in your yard.
[00:44:33.894 --> 00:44:37.835]  They're going to put you in jail for not properly weatherproofing your house.
[00:44:37.915 --> 00:44:39.576]  This is the new greening tyranny.
[00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:40.696]  The new Soviet model.
[00:44:40.996 --> 00:44:43.237]  And they're going to publicly shame you on the news.
[00:44:44.017 --> 00:44:45.438]  And they're going to work you.
[00:44:45.458 --> 00:44:48.919]  You have to understand, under the civilian inmate labor camp program, the model
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.904]  States Health Emergency Powers Act under the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:44:54.204 --> 00:44:55.585]  I hope you're writing all this down.
[00:44:55.885 --> 00:44:58.308]  Under the Army Manuals we've covered here at Nauseam.
[00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:05.234]  Just type in Army Manual has forced labor, Army Manual has gun confiscation, Army Manual says re-education camp.
[00:45:05.454 --> 00:45:08.096]  You'll get our articles with links to army.mil with it.
[00:45:09.037 --> 00:45:10.398]  That guy's just showing some of that right now.
[00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:12.320]  They're watching on presentplanet.tv.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.361]  Radio listeners, go search it.
[00:45:14.362 --> 00:45:15.043]  Go do it for yourself.
[00:45:16.019 --> 00:45:23.923]  Under the whole architecture of this, they're already now, as I told you a decade ago, they're announcing, oh, when things collapse, you'll have to work at the emergency center.
[00:45:25.004 --> 00:45:25.884]  You'll have to do some work.
[00:45:25.964 --> 00:45:28.186]  Obviously, we're not going to pay for you living in the camp.
[00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:40.572]  And then those of us that have skills will be, if we're trustees and prove we're good after a few months in the re-education camp, we'll be told, OK, go with these armed guards and go fix this government boiler.
[00:45:41.693 --> 00:45:42.954]  OK, go with these armed guards.
[00:45:42.994 --> 00:45:44.034]  Go out and work on these streets.
[00:45:44.114 --> 00:45:45.115]  It'll be like you see the prisoners.
[00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:49.029]  Who are taking other people's jobs, by the way.
[00:45:49.049 --> 00:45:50.596]  People are like, we'll make the prisoners work.
[00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.560]  What, for nothing?
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.724]  For 25 cents an hour or less?
[00:45:53.672 --> 00:45:59.316]  And then you'll go, and you'll bust out, and then these guys with guns, they'll be nice to you too if you don't get too out of the way.
[00:45:59.796 --> 00:46:11.984]  You know, if jail guards don't want your wife, then they'll go, you know, lock you up in the camp at night, and there'll be people in the camp who, who were patriots, who will get scared and become energetic enforcers, and they'll be back a month later in a uniform.
[00:46:12.424 --> 00:46:14.565]  But then they'll make somebody mad, and then they'll disappear.
[00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:21.490]  Because see, what they'll do is they'll have camps within camps for interrogation, then they'll say, oh, you've been out of line, we're sending you now
[00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.012]  To a high security facility and you'll just be killed.
[00:46:26.873 --> 00:46:28.274]  The mercenaries are at that facility.
[00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:29.935]  And this has all been figured out.
[00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:35.218]  They hired the former head of the KGB, Primakov, in 2002 to 2005 to come here.
[00:46:35.258 --> 00:46:36.679]  I didn't believe that when I first saw it on the news.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.040]  I looked at the congressional funding.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.642]  They hired Marcus Wolf, the head of the Stasi, to come over.
[00:46:41.342 --> 00:46:42.363]  Former head of the Stasi.
[00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:44.404]  He had a million dollar contract for, what, four years?
[00:46:44.464 --> 00:46:45.225]  He's now dead.
[00:46:45.705 --> 00:46:46.906]  Helping set all the stuff up.
[00:46:46.926 --> 00:46:47.947]  And that's why it's Stasi.
[00:46:48.763 --> 00:46:52.884]  I mean, the enforcement model is a hardcore communist enforcement system.
[00:46:53.124 --> 00:46:56.025]  That's why people from communist countries are freaking out and leaving the U.S.
[00:46:56.325 --> 00:46:57.706]  and running to Latin America and places.
[00:46:57.726 --> 00:47:00.546]  Because they can deal with regular old corruption and shakedowns.
[00:47:00.787 --> 00:47:07.709]  But when they're like seeing actual Soviet oppression that, you know, where daddy and mommy disappeared, they're like, I'm getting out of here.
[00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:10.830]  Hope you enjoy it, folks.
[00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:12.750]  James in North Carolina.
[00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.291]  You want to talk about 2012?
[00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:14.531]  Go ahead.
[00:47:16.665 --> 00:47:19.226]  Yeah, actually, good to talk to you again Alex, it's been a couple months.
[00:47:19.786 --> 00:47:26.028]  And I'd also called in in reference to the information you guys were putting out in regards to the Colorado case.
[00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:36.172]  You may recall, I called in a little while ago actually and gave you some information on a DARPA program called Crossing the Threshold.
[00:47:37.713 --> 00:47:38.273]  We talked about
[00:47:38.957 --> 00:47:47.963]  Actually, the sawbearer being broken by DARPA and using light particles to actually be able to do it and manipulate people and take over mind control.
[00:47:48.184 --> 00:47:55.028]  Oh, well, yeah, I mean, as Dr. Begich says, a prestigious scientist, the chemical stuff is old.
[00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:56.289]  That's 1940s, 50s Soviet technology.
[00:47:59.091 --> 00:48:01.793]  Stolen by the CIA and perfected to a higher level.
[00:48:01.833 --> 00:48:03.915]  Not quite perfected, but brought close to it.
[00:48:04.876 --> 00:48:10.400]  With the brain chips and things, it's total... I mean, 30 years ago, they had roaches that remote control.
[00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:13.482]  20 years ago, they had robo-rats that remote control.
[00:48:13.522 --> 00:48:16.745]  Yeah, they can put brain chips in and have you do whatever you're told.
[00:48:18.024 --> 00:48:19.926]  Well, actually, it even goes a step beyond that now.
[00:48:19.966 --> 00:48:23.448]  The ability they have is actually using light particles and light beams.
[00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:28.292]  They can actually achieve thought profiling and transfer into any language.
[00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:29.693]  No, I know.
[00:48:30.514 --> 00:48:36.919]  Because the brain program works in a flicker rate and then they can now transmit data through the eyes directly to the brain.
[00:48:36.939 --> 00:48:42.203]  That's why they're in government buildings putting in the lights that, quote, communicate with the computers at a flash rate.
[00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:47.789]  That can't be perceived consciously, and then I went and found the patents now, Dr. Begichon, it's actually programmers.
[00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:54.197]  They're actually programming now, under federal grants, mainly in police departments, to test and see if they can put police under mind control.
[00:48:55.305 --> 00:49:04.689]  Yes sir, and I actually spoke with you on this previously and work in the insurance industry and actually have had some information sent over from a company that's participating in this.
[00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:17.594]  They gave some information out and said basically that we're going to be able to communicate with animals, they can do all this stuff, you know, simultaneously while, you know, achieving thought profiling of people without them knowing.
[00:49:18.474 --> 00:49:24.817]  Actually, you're saying that this is... Why don't you send over anything that isn't proprietary or classified?
[00:49:25.177 --> 00:49:26.357]  I know you're in insurance, so it's not.
[00:49:26.637 --> 00:49:27.317]  Send it on over.
[00:49:27.357 --> 00:49:27.878]  We're media.
[00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:33.820]  Send it to showtipsandinfowars.com, and I am aware of all this, and I am aware of its deployment all over.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.801]  I mean, that's why the elite are so arrogant right now.
[00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:39.182]  The public is already in a trance.
[00:49:39.802 --> 00:49:44.404]  Some people are resistant or immune to this, and that's why we're still able to operate.
[00:49:44.764 --> 00:49:46.726]  I mean, that's why, folks, it's so far gone.
[00:49:46.746 --> 00:49:49.308]  I mean, that's why celebrity doesn't matter.
[00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:51.350]  Attacks on me don't matter.
[00:49:52.171 --> 00:49:52.551]  None of it.
[00:49:53.252 --> 00:49:56.875]  Once you know reality, none of this facade even matters anymore.
[00:49:57.476 --> 00:49:59.678]  And they haven't perfected all this stuff.
[00:49:59.718 --> 00:50:01.019]  They're testing it on us right now.
[00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:06.844]  And I just want to say to all the minions of this system, if you want your free will and consciousness taken, don't fight this.
[00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:10.167]  Because they're just going to try to get us in a catatonic state.
[00:50:11.195 --> 00:50:13.937]  To then release the bioweapons to reduce our numbers over 90%.
[00:50:14.858 --> 00:50:15.519]  Anything else, sir?
[00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:17.060]  Ah, yes.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.523]  Right now, it's on a basically a one-on-one type of basis.
[00:50:20.543 --> 00:50:24.766]  The people they used to profile can only do it, they can't do it on a mass scale yet.
[00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:35.935]  So, I mean, like you were just saying, before it gets to the point where they can actually, you know, systematically put something in place or a computer program, you know, where it can do it on a mass scale, I mean, this is a time where... Well, I mean, take San Antonio.
[00:50:36.235 --> 00:50:37.016]  It's a test ground.
[00:50:37.656 --> 00:50:45.783]  You've heard for three years how the Pentagon put AI cameras in to track the calories to even scan an apple when a child eats it and then put it in a file.
[00:50:46.744 --> 00:50:51.247]  What's really going on is they've put those light bulbs in, in that San Antonio school.
[00:50:51.447 --> 00:50:52.768]  I have that from inside the school.
[00:50:53.489 --> 00:50:59.794]  The first one they did it and the computers are actually testing the children under the fluorescent lights.
[00:51:00.995 --> 00:51:02.876]  It's so far gone, folks.
[00:51:03.157 --> 00:51:04.057]  We're so far gone.
[00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:06.652]  Lunch is ready!
[00:51:07.052 --> 00:51:10.577]  And it's an MRE smorgasbord at longlifefood.com.
[00:51:10.677 --> 00:51:15.082]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.
[00:51:15.223 --> 00:51:17.766]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[00:51:17.906 --> 00:51:21.831]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet.
[00:51:22.031 --> 00:51:23.732]  Because MREs are all we do.

[00:54:14.345 --> 00:54:16.526]  I have been inside major universities.
[00:54:16.746 --> 00:54:17.727]  I've had scientists on.
[00:54:17.747 --> 00:54:18.627]  I've broken it down.
[00:54:20.668 --> 00:54:24.410]  So much of the focus by the globalists is on flicker rates with lights.
[00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.291]  And now they can interface and transmit data directly to the brain.
[00:54:29.052 --> 00:54:35.275]  In fact, I mean, it was in mainstream news, what, two weeks ago, that scientists use light patterns to program brain.
[00:54:36.255 --> 00:54:39.458]  And, I mean, so, but they're now announcing what's old.
[00:54:39.798 --> 00:54:48.967]  The point is, just like you have a cell phone and it listens to you even when it's off, and they admit the NSA now does that, I told you 16 years ago, they now admit it just the last few years.
[00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:56.334]  They tell you way after they think that you've habitualized its use, that you have a total habit and will accept it.
[00:54:57.114 --> 00:54:58.415]  It's all animal training.
[00:54:58.576 --> 00:54:59.857]  It's all domestication.
[00:55:01.408 --> 00:55:04.090]  And everything is how to program you with these lights.
[00:55:05.211 --> 00:55:08.373]  And it's just insane.
[00:55:08.413 --> 00:55:18.561]  Now they have data over power lines and the smart meters can program through the energy, through regular, regular fluorescent light bulbs.
[00:55:20.763 --> 00:55:24.406]  And program your mind, puts you into a state.
[00:55:25.216 --> 00:55:25.436]  Yeah.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.842]  But you can't hear it in your ear, it resonates in your skull directly through telling you you want to drink the drink.
[00:55:49.183 --> 00:56:02.348]  Now they face scan with Facebook in Japan, they're also testing this in New York City, where it knows you when you walk by, beams audio and says don't you want a Pepsi, don't you want a Coke, or don't you want something out of this vending machine, John Doe.
[00:56:03.149 --> 00:56:05.570]  Now you saw that minority report, what a decade ago.
[00:56:06.857 --> 00:56:09.299]  Because folks, it isn't Minority Report.
[00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:15.865]  Philip K. Dick was in with some very powerful researchers in San Francisco.
[00:56:16.545 --> 00:56:20.669]  And I've had a chance to talk to people connected to the Philip K. Dick estate.
[00:56:20.769 --> 00:56:21.870]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:56:23.308 --> 00:56:33.636]  And, uh, in fact, they may even be at liberty to come on after the show, make me, I didn't call any of those people I told you to make me call yesterday, make me call those people as I got stuck in other meetings.
[00:56:34.317 --> 00:56:36.458]  Because I want to try to get the Philip K. Dick daughters on.
[00:56:37.299 --> 00:56:38.420]  I'll just, I'll just say it.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:49.928]  And I want to try to get, uh, because obviously I was in Scanner Darkly and consulted on that with Keanu Reeves and others, uh, Woody Harrelson and others, and, and, and they authorized the rights for that Philip K. Dick to be turned into a movie, so that's how I,
[00:56:50.709 --> 00:56:52.791]  I have a connection through Tommy Pallotta, the producer.
[00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:56.334]  I need to get Tommy on because Tommy knows a lot too, but I don't know how much.
[00:56:56.414 --> 00:57:00.157]  The point is, folks, he wrote that stuff in the 70s.
[00:57:01.538 --> 00:57:01.879]  Okay?
[00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:03.420]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.683]  All this stuff was envisioned a long time ago.
[00:57:06.963 --> 00:57:08.284]  We're living in a plan.
[00:57:09.145 --> 00:57:11.207]  The globalists are 30 years at least ahead of us.
[00:57:12.327 --> 00:57:23.991]  And I just want to communicate with the globalists and say, you're not, this old plan is dynamic, it's amazing you've been able to do this, but you're so cold-blooded, you think that's your strength, that's your weakness.
[00:57:25.812 --> 00:57:27.473]  And you're going to end up destroying yourself.
[00:57:27.553 --> 00:57:30.894]  You can't do this to the species and not have it come back on you.
[00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:41.458]  And I know a lot of you are turned over to pure evil, but some of your children and people who are now middle-aged, who aren't pure evil, and others, because I've talked to you,
[00:57:44.286 --> 00:57:46.947]  Including some European heads of state.
[00:57:47.807 --> 00:57:49.528]  And you're having second thoughts about this.
[00:57:49.608 --> 00:57:51.028]  You don't want to do this.
[00:57:53.889 --> 00:57:54.989]  You don't want to do this.
[00:57:55.489 --> 00:57:57.050]  But I'm on two paths here.
[00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.571]  Trying to convince you this is not a good path.
[00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:02.592]  And trying to wake up whoever's not in a full trance right now.
[00:58:04.392 --> 00:58:06.693]  I said I'd go to calls and I got a guest coming up.
[00:58:06.813 --> 00:58:08.133]  The guest is only on for 30 minutes.
[00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:13.175]  But Maureen and Chris and Mike and others, we'll get to you.
[00:58:14.397 --> 00:58:15.937]  We've got a little five-minute segment here.
[00:58:15.957 --> 00:58:18.178]  I'll get to some of you, and then after the guest leaves, I'll get you on.
[00:58:18.198 --> 00:58:20.539]  We've got a whistleblower coming on, is what I'd call it.
[00:58:21.439 --> 00:58:30.841]  His dad on his deathbed told him some pretty powerful info, and let me tell you, when Larry Abraham talks, co-author of Nunder Call Conspiracy with Gary Allen, Alex Jones listens.
[00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:35.722]  So it's Gary Allen's son, Larry Abraham, from the grave.
[00:58:36.503 --> 00:58:41.264]  Yes, Larry Abraham's son will be speaking to us from the grave, Joshua Abraham.
[00:58:47.554 --> 00:58:51.545]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:54.813 --> 00:58:57.615]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:58:57.876 --> 00:58:59.557]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:58:59.857 --> 00:59:03.160]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:59:03.481 --> 00:59:05.562]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:59:05.683 --> 00:59:09.126]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:59:09.326 --> 00:59:15.151]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:59:15.411 --> 00:59:18.654]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:59:18.994 --> 00:59:23.618]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:59:23.758 --> 00:59:29.482]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:59:29.742 --> 00:59:30.803]  And here's the best news.
[00:59:31.023 --> 00:59:33.966]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[00:59:34.186 --> 00:59:37.989]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:40.691]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators,

[00:59:52.238 --> 00:59:54.059]  That's FallTruckLoadSale.com.
[01:00:09.434 --> 01:00:13.557]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.078]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.858 --> 01:00:16.779]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.399 --> 01:00:21.002]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.602 --> 01:00:25.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.725 --> 01:00:30.168]  Okay, we will continue with your calls after our guest leaves us in about 30-35 minutes.
[01:00:30.228 --> 01:00:34.551]  I'm going to go to your calls right now, into the second hour.
[01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:38.363]  Maureen in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:00:38.423 --> 01:00:39.243]  Welcome, thanks for holding.
[01:00:40.244 --> 01:00:41.685]  Hi Alex, thank you so much.
[01:00:41.885 --> 01:00:45.327]  I'm a really big fan of yours, so I really love your show.
[01:00:45.427 --> 01:00:46.468]  It's great to speak with you.
[01:00:47.088 --> 01:00:48.989]  I just basically wanted to ask a question.
[01:00:49.009 --> 01:00:54.593]  Do you see any tie-in between the coming, or I should say current,
[01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:02.098]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:09.365]  It's an archetype that a new age is going to begin, but they mean their new false age of tyranny.
[01:01:09.405 --> 01:01:10.886]  The globalists are always counterfeits.
[01:01:11.707 --> 01:01:25.044]  And so, basically, they're saying that they want, at a subconscious level, you to believe you're dead already, and that you have no power, so you will just accept the new paradigm they give you, which is the loss of free will.
[01:01:25.064 --> 01:01:28.929]  Right, so everything is basically better than, I guess...
[01:01:32.243 --> 01:01:34.644]  Well, it is the end of the world as we know it.
[01:01:34.964 --> 01:01:37.726]  You know, to take a line from the R.E.M.
[01:01:37.746 --> 01:01:38.026]  song.
[01:01:38.707 --> 01:01:40.628]  Man, we should be playing that every day in the build-up.
[01:01:40.668 --> 01:01:42.049]  How many days till the end of the world?
[01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.410]  The media will cut that out of context.
[01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:45.651]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:47.532]  But it is the end of the family.
[01:01:47.592 --> 01:01:49.133]  It is the end of our human genetics.
[01:01:49.153 --> 01:01:50.014]  We're being manipulated.
[01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:52.875]  It is the end of the earth as designed by the Creator.
[01:01:52.915 --> 01:01:56.838]  It is the globalist playing God, as in the days of Noah.
[01:01:57.658 --> 01:01:59.879]  It's all repeating itself in a horrible way.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.402]  And so, you know, it's not that Noah was perfect in his generations.
[01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:07.303]  His genetics were perfect.
[01:02:07.963 --> 01:02:10.905]  And again, the globalists seek to defile everything.
[01:02:11.806 --> 01:02:20.368]  They seek to play God, and they are trying to destroy the Earth while attaining off-world technology.
[01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:24.728]  As best I research, this is what the highest level Illuminists are saying.
[01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:28.029]  The old world has to die for a new world to be created.
[01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:35.370]  So they want to be able to remake the world, hence the underground seed vaults that aren't GMO, the rest of it, while they attain the interface with computers.
[01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:39.431]  They're willing to destroy the Earth to gain that life extension technology.
[01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:42.452]  But that's the spiritual deception.
[01:02:42.472 --> 01:02:43.392]  They're not going to be given that.
[01:02:45.973 --> 01:02:50.575]  And so they believe they must become as gods, but the old world must pass away.
[01:02:51.996 --> 01:02:56.218]  And they're prepared to fight with the computers they're going to use to get rid of us.
[01:02:56.578 --> 01:03:01.340]  The computers will be used as Skynet to enforce the takeover of the old dominion of man.
[01:03:02.284 --> 01:03:04.926]  But then the globalists will double-cross the computers as well.
[01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:07.867]  And that's what 2001 Space Odyssey is all about.
[01:03:08.548 --> 01:03:10.349]  These are the highest secrets of the Illuminati.
[01:03:10.909 --> 01:03:11.370]  Anything else?
[01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:27.420]  Well, I'm just amazed at your insight, and I have to say, listening to your show, it's really opened my eyes to, like, how corrupt people really are, and I think it's sad, and I think we have to do what you said, and, you know, fight for our families, fight for our country.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.341]  And I'm right there with you.
[01:03:30.578 --> 01:03:31.038]  Well, yes.
[01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:31.759]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:03:31.779 --> 01:03:33.300]  God bless you and thanks for your kind words.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.462]  Look, I'm just trying to survive and trying to have humanity go forward with some of our genetics intact, basically.
[01:03:39.243 --> 01:03:41.884]  But it's my love letter to humanity.
[01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:44.326]  I mean, just because I love goodness.
[01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:47.668]  I mean, I've got my dark side too, but my good side's a lot better.
[01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:51.790]  And listen, they've designed the world where corruption is all that succeeds now.
[01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.210]  But that's only for the high-level controllers.
[01:03:55.490 --> 01:04:00.774]  The low-level folks could still succeed and we could still build a system based on mutual respect and honor.
[01:04:02.556 --> 01:04:08.961]  But the losers, as they're called, have been programmed believing that only corruption will give them power.
[01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:15.846]  And so they're following that when they're designed like an enzyme to basically liquefy the tissue of the society.
[01:04:17.728 --> 01:04:20.010]  So the people have been programmed to be corrupt.
[01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:26.396]  And again, people that are corrupt, it hurts me that they have fallen, that they have totally failed.
[01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:33.321]  That they're just rolling around in their squalor is extremely painful.
[01:04:34.462 --> 01:04:36.163]  And I do want to uplift humanity.
[01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:37.083]  I'm a fan of man.
[01:04:37.724 --> 01:04:41.506]  And again, Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate says the devil's a fan of man.
[01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:47.871]  The devil comes to kill, steal and destroy and wants to hurt humans because the devil isn't a creator.
[01:04:50.188 --> 01:04:57.316]  These entities, angels, whatever you want to call them, if you read the Bible, and every other ancient culture, they can't create, so they want to destroy.
[01:04:57.336 --> 01:05:01.321]  They can only have man create ugly, twisted things for them.
[01:05:04.913 --> 01:05:08.955]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:10.135]  Don't be one of them!
[01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:15.797]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:25.561]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[01:05:25.761 --> 01:05:32.423]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[01:05:32.543 --> 01:05:36.666]  Such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[01:05:36.886 --> 01:05:45.853]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:05:45.993 --> 01:05:49.436]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:05:49.656 --> 01:05:53.319]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:11.176]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:07:11.576 --> 01:07:13.958]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:07:14.058 --> 01:07:14.338]  The U.S.
[01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:18.521]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:07:18.641 --> 01:07:21.223]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:07:21.603 --> 01:07:22.844]  They want that attack to come.
[01:07:23.084 --> 01:07:29.288]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:07:29.676 --> 01:07:32.118]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:07:32.338 --> 01:07:37.121]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:07:37.301 --> 01:07:44.726]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:07:45.046 --> 01:07:47.587]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:07:47.807 --> 01:07:50.408]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:09:05.536 --> 01:09:06.136]  Not on Sirius.
[01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:07.437]  They need to put us on Sirius too.
[01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:10.800]  None dare call it conspiracy.
[01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:21.603]  This is the book that I remember seeing around the coffee table and multiple copies on the bookshelf.
[01:09:21.643 --> 01:09:25.865]  And I remember before I could even read, pulling it off the bookshelf and looking at it.
[01:09:26.706 --> 01:09:29.927]  This is a more recent reprint of it, a little bit larger format.
[01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:32.889]  It was a little bit smaller paperback in size.
[01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:36.290]  The runaway bestseller, over five million in print.
[01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:38.151]  I think that's an old reprint.
[01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:39.472]  I think it's well over five million.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.235]  And patriots got these, bought these at cost by the hundreds apiece.
[01:09:45.315 --> 01:09:47.162]  People like Bobby Vaughn.
[01:09:48.530 --> 01:10:05.879]  My parents, good friends, they're on San Fernando Way in Dallas, Texas, where I was born and grew up, and he would babysit me sometimes, because he worked for the telephone company at night, so then he was up in the afternoon, like his morning, and sometimes he'd keep me.
[01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:12.703]  And I remember rock and roll music blaring off his turntable, and even sometimes he'd give me a little drink of beer when I was like three.
[01:10:13.203 --> 01:10:14.244]  You know, kids love beer.
[01:10:14.524 --> 01:10:15.805]  Point is, I get one sip of beer.
[01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:16.066]  Come on.
[01:10:16.486 --> 01:10:19.228]  And I remember this book, and he was in the John Birch Society.
[01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:20.129]  He's now died.
[01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:21.050]  He died of brain cancer.
[01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:22.071]  Great guy, though.
[01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:24.513]  The point is, we stayed in contact with him until he died.
[01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:30.218]  The point is, he would, a few years ago, he would run around and talk about the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, and all this.
[01:10:30.278 --> 01:10:34.842]  And my dad already knew about it from when he was a teenager, because he would go around giving anti-communist speeches.
[01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:41.224]  There was even on the radio in Dallas some, speaking out against this stuff, but didn't stop fighting it when he got into college.
[01:10:41.284 --> 01:10:42.064]  It's a side issue.
[01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.205]  The point is, I remember all the John Birchers coming over.
[01:10:45.265 --> 01:10:46.085]  My dad wasn't even in it.
[01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:49.265]  But they would all come over, and how about the New World Order around coffee?
[01:10:51.106 --> 01:10:53.506]  And I'm now spending all the time covering this.
[01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:57.567]  The point is, I then read this book, I don't know, when I was like 12, when I started becoming a really good reader.
[01:10:58.047 --> 01:10:58.987]  And I read it again when I was about 16.
[01:10:59.147 --> 01:11:00.507]  I've read it three times.
[01:11:01.247 --> 01:11:02.107]  And it was published, what, in 1970?
[01:11:02.188 --> 01:11:02.948]  Let me open it up.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:12.224]  1972, written in 1971, with Gary Allen and Larry Abraham.
[01:11:13.285 --> 01:11:20.450]  Gary Allen's son went on to found Politico, which I guess does cover Bilderberg occasionally, but it's kind of mainline, more liberal.
[01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:21.850]  Wow.
[01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:27.174]  But Larry Abraham, his son Joshua Abraham, is the eighth son of Larry Abraham's 11 children.
[01:11:27.554 --> 01:11:31.857]  He is a former top wakeboarder and former sponsored snowskier.
[01:11:32.217 --> 01:11:34.559]  He's been researching his father's work for the last four years.
[01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:36.803]  Eleven children.
[01:11:36.843 --> 01:11:37.784]  Man, talk about wealth.
[01:11:37.824 --> 01:11:39.205]  That's as wealthy as it gets.
[01:11:39.305 --> 01:11:41.828]  That's more wealth than somebody with a trillion bucks if they don't have eleven kids.
[01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:42.709]  I envy that.
[01:11:42.809 --> 01:11:43.209]  Believe me.
[01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:48.974]  But none dare call a conspiracy available at InfoWarsStore.com, I should add.
[01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:51.437]  And the fellow that reprinted it just died of cancer.
[01:11:51.957 --> 01:11:56.221]  So we're hoping to get it back in print, but we've got most of the copies that are left right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:11:57.082 --> 01:12:04.467]  I don't mean to start a run on these, but it's just a fact, along with the republishing of Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley that the same publisher put out.
[01:12:04.808 --> 01:12:21.620]  But he joins us here, and I've got some notes to break some news about what his dad talked about, what he disclosed to him days before he died in 2008 on July 7th, and why his son got interested in the New World Order.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.442]  A lot of kids, you know, don't really get interested in what their parents are until later.
[01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.711]  So he joins us here.
[01:12:29.731 --> 01:12:33.213]  We'll have about 40 after or so, then we'll go to your calls, those that are holding.
[01:12:33.573 --> 01:12:39.456]  And we'll get you back again, Josh Abraham, because it's good to hear from your father, Larry Abraham, from the grave.
[01:12:41.337 --> 01:12:51.763]  And I commend your father's work because, I mean, the information they had from congressional sources, Larry McDonald and others, there's no book that's been currently written that lays out how it all works.
[01:12:52.143 --> 01:12:53.904]  And this was written 30, 40 years ago.
[01:12:53.924 --> 01:12:54.865]  I guess 40 years ago.
[01:12:57.126 --> 01:13:03.534]  I mean, I was born in 74, and this book had already been out for many years and millions out there, so I just can't gush enough about it.
[01:13:05.536 --> 01:13:06.518]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:13:07.599 --> 01:13:09.461]  Oh, thank you for having me, Alex Jones.
[01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:15.769]  Okay, tell us about your awakening the last four years, what your dad told you on his deathbed.
[01:13:17.179 --> 01:13:19.760]  Well, first of all, let me say thank you for having me on.
[01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:21.501]  It's a great pleasure to be on your show.
[01:13:21.542 --> 01:13:24.583]  I've been listening to you for about over a year now.
[01:13:24.603 --> 01:13:28.165]  First of all, I want to say thank you.
[01:13:28.185 --> 01:13:33.288]  Second of all, I want to say thank you to my creator, my creator Jesus.
[01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:37.391]  I liked how you were talking about earlier about
[01:13:38.277 --> 01:13:38.717]  We're good.
[01:13:53.553 --> 01:13:57.416]  He doesn't judge humans for their judgment calls that they make.
[01:13:57.436 --> 01:14:07.084]  Because if you think about it, who in their right mind could ever possibly deny that the 20th century completely belonged to the devil?
[01:14:07.244 --> 01:14:13.829]  We had two world wars, then we had the Gulf War, you know, we had all these wars going on.
[01:14:14.369 --> 01:14:19.433]  And what's really kind of blowing my mind is that when you got all the evidence laid out in front of you,
[01:14:20.274 --> 01:14:34.235]  All this, um, evidence, like, sneaking into the movies of what directors are saying, and what all the research that I've come across in the past couple years, you know, Hollywood is, you know, they're trying to tell us something.
[01:14:34.915 --> 01:14:43.422]  The guy who wrote The Devil's Advocate, the guy who wrote that movie, me and my brother Kai, we talk about a lot whenever we hook up and hang out with each other.
[01:14:43.782 --> 01:14:50.988]  There was something really being said when Al Pacino was talking to Kevin or Keanu Reeves in that movie.
[01:14:52.749 --> 01:14:54.650]  Well it's funny I raised that, now you're bringing that up.
[01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:58.373]  For people who don't know about your father, tell us about him a little bit.
[01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:59.194]  I think that's important.
[01:15:00.215 --> 01:15:03.237]  Well my father, you know, he was a great man, Alex.
[01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:08.096]  The fact of the matter is, my father had a message.
[01:15:08.657 --> 01:15:13.341]  And that message is, there is something going on that is not right.
[01:15:13.902 --> 01:15:18.666]  And the book that he wrote, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, he provides the evidence.
[01:15:19.207 --> 01:15:23.050]  Gary Allen wrote that book, and my father did the research for it.
[01:15:23.431 --> 01:15:25.172]  But a lot of people tend to forget
[01:15:26.073 --> 01:15:35.236]  That my father's legacy of the books that he wrote, he had another one, the sequel called Call a Conspiracy after Nundare was written.
[01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:39.877]  And then my personal favorite was this book called The Greening.
[01:15:40.357 --> 01:15:48.120]  The Greening was a book that he wrote in 1992 when I was just a kid and he was living out in Gig Harbor Beach.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:00.931]  And what this book is about is about how in current day, you know, Nonderekala conspiracy gave us the overrun of what's going on and who's involved and how it was all set up.
[01:16:01.732 --> 01:16:09.479]  Now The Greening explains in today's world, in today's events, what Agenda 21 and what all this
[01:16:12.842 --> 01:16:20.946]  EPA, all this government regulation with permits, all these unnecessary rules that we go through.
[01:16:20.966 --> 01:16:24.468]  I mean, a lot of small business owners know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:25.028 --> 01:16:32.752]  But all these little environmentalist rules and all these regulations, this is all derived from paganism.
[01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:35.633]  This is all about Agenda 21.
[01:16:37.369 --> 01:16:48.562]  The Georgia Guidestones, with the Ten Commandments, with number one being, you gotta reduce the population to half a billion, to have a perfect balance with man and nature.
[01:16:48.582 --> 01:16:56.250]  And at the higher level they admit that, they even say this in the Human Biological Diversity Assessment 1996, they said human sacrifice, and I have shots of this.
[01:16:58.873 --> 01:17:02.696]  Not the boil down on the UN website, but I went to the UT library and got it.
[01:17:02.716 --> 01:17:03.517]  You can get it, folks.
[01:17:03.997 --> 01:17:10.383]  Where they said we were going to reintroduce ritualized war and human sacrifice because Gaia needs blood.
[01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:12.285]  This is official UN law.
[01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:15.928]  I mean, these people are absolute devil worshippers.
[01:17:16.169 --> 01:17:19.171]  But they'll say, oh no, our gods predates your Christian devil.
[01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:20.613]  Please continue.
[01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:31.158]  Well, you're exactly right, and what really kind of blows my mind, and when I try to bring this evidence to my friends and my family, I ask them one simple question.
[01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:36.843]  First of all, I say, you know, human beings don't do things without a reason.
[01:17:37.603 --> 01:17:39.124]  Now let me give you a question.
[01:17:39.825 --> 01:17:50.654]  Why are the most important, most powerful, most important, powerful, richest people on this planet worshiping Satan?
[01:17:51.494 --> 01:17:52.535]  Why are they doing it?
[01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.036]  Because, Alex, it's real.
[01:17:55.576 --> 01:18:02.559]  And what really shocked me, after my father died, I didn't come across his information.
[01:18:02.619 --> 01:18:04.500]  I didn't even read his books while he was alive.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.761]  And every day I have to live with that, Alex.
[01:18:06.942 --> 01:18:09.623]  I have to live with the fact that my dad is not here.
[01:18:11.075 --> 01:18:12.676]  And I need him now more than ever.
[01:18:13.376 --> 01:18:15.237]  Because I didn't, I wasn't interested.
[01:18:15.277 --> 01:18:16.378]  I was a young kid.
[01:18:16.418 --> 01:18:18.099]  You know, I was like in my younger twenties.
[01:18:18.139 --> 01:18:20.901]  You know, I was doing my wakeboarding and my snowskiing.
[01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:24.623]  No, no, the world programs you that mom and pop don't know anything.
[01:18:24.943 --> 01:18:31.307]  Well, even if people's parents aren't perfect, they at least instinctively care about you when the rest of the world could care less.
[01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:49.312]  Exactly, and what's really crazy is that when I came across the question of what's going on, I did all my research, and then I just realized, I mean, people say how they found Jesus or they found God, no, like, I found Satan!
[01:18:50.033 --> 01:18:58.676]  I found that the world's most powerful leaders were worshiping Satan because you can't have Jesus without Satan or the other way around.
[01:18:58.796 --> 01:19:05.919]  And you're not going to run this world, you're not going to be the God of this world, you're not going to be in power if you don't serve the God of this world.
[01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:07.319]  Exactly.
[01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:14.662]  And then people tend to forget, you know, all you Bible scholars and Christians out there, you should really, really listen up because
[01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.473]  Lucifer is the god of air.
[01:19:19.013 --> 01:19:21.275]  Lucifer is the god of music.
[01:19:21.395 --> 01:19:23.196]  He is the god of this planet.
[01:19:23.496 --> 01:19:31.362]  But what we have to come to grips with is that Yeshua and his father God... Yeshua is his real name.
[01:19:31.442 --> 01:19:32.542]  You all know him as Jesus.
[01:19:32.582 --> 01:19:38.126]  But Yeshua and his father God are the actual rulers of the universe.
[01:19:38.226 --> 01:19:41.909]  Satan is just the god of this small little planet.
[01:19:42.369 --> 01:19:46.352]  What we have to come to grips with is that we're not the center of the universe.
[01:19:46.372 --> 01:19:48.393]  There are so... I mean, we all know there's... Exactly.
[01:19:48.433 --> 01:19:51.075]  Let's get into what your dad told you on his deathbed straight ahead.
[01:19:51.095 --> 01:19:54.237]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy with Gary Allen and Larry Abraham.
[01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:57.139]  His son joins us now, Josh Abraham.
[01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.400]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.042]  And then your phone calls and a ton of news coming up today.
[01:20:05.854 --> 01:20:08.718]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?

[01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:20.815]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:20:21.095 --> 01:20:24.578]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:20:24.838 --> 01:20:30.182]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:20:30.423 --> 01:20:34.166]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:20:34.486 --> 01:20:39.530]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.

[01:21:05.376 --> 01:21:12.266]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming disaster and may not survive without?
[01:21:12.286 --> 01:21:16.191]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S.
[01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:17.733]  and you have got to be prepared.
[01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:22.240]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:34.487]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis, then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:44.713]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[01:21:45.273 --> 01:21:54.517]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after a disaster and may not survive without.
[01:21:54.798 --> 01:22:00.520]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:02.141]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[01:22:04.835 --> 01:22:08.577]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:12.599]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.

[01:22:34.973 --> 01:22:39.356]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:39.536 --> 01:22:45.240]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.762]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:48.982 --> 01:22:51.584]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:07.935]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:08.596 --> 01:23:10.717]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:11.618 --> 01:23:19.964]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:20.584 --> 01:23:25.508]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:26.124 --> 01:23:37.093]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:37.494 --> 01:23:44.520]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:24:00.353 --> 01:24:01.334]  Protect your immune system.
[01:24:01.614 --> 01:24:02.655]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:13.928 --> 01:24:33.396]  If you think the 20th century was the devil's century... You know, I laugh when I think about evil because all the idiots serving it have no idea how bad their judgment is in this life.
[01:24:33.416 --> 01:24:39.619]  All you people that think you're on the winning team serving evil because you're so cowardly and weak, you have no idea.
[01:24:40.814 --> 01:24:42.555]  You have no idea what you're going to be turned over to.
[01:24:42.835 --> 01:24:45.376]  So keep abusing the innocent like a bunch of piranhas.
[01:24:45.876 --> 01:24:47.057]  Go as fast as you can.
[01:24:47.117 --> 01:24:48.257]  Do as much bad as you can.
[01:24:48.858 --> 01:24:50.939]  Because you're going to get it back a trillion times.
[01:24:50.999 --> 01:24:51.439]  Remember that.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.240]  You know what hell is?
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.761]  It's being thrown into the spiritual energy you support.
[01:24:56.801 --> 01:24:58.222]  It's being with yourself.
[01:24:58.262 --> 01:25:00.903]  It's being cut off from those of us that aren't like you.
[01:25:01.483 --> 01:25:02.804]  But enough of that, okay?
[01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.165]  Yes, we know it's a spiritual battle.
[01:25:04.185 --> 01:25:05.905]  We know the churches are government run now.
[01:25:05.945 --> 01:25:07.026]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:25:08.635 --> 01:25:15.880]  Going back to Josh Abraham, whose father co-wrote the book and did the research with Gary Allen for None Dare Call It Conspiracy.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.421]  He joins us.
[01:25:17.781 --> 01:25:26.227]  Tell us what your dad told you four years ago when he died on his deathbed that got you back on the path to researching what's going on and discovering how much your father really knew.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:38.382]  Well, a week before he died, we were sitting there on the couch watching Fox News, and a story came up about contaminated water.
[01:25:39.442 --> 01:25:49.564]  And keep in mind, whenever I watched Fox News and my dad, he would just ramble on and on, like, oh, these communists, these globalists, these this and these that.
[01:25:50.124 --> 01:25:56.946]  But then he turned to me, and he was like, you know, son, what they're doing in our water is what they're going to be doing to our air here very soon.
[01:25:57.901 --> 01:26:00.024]  And I looked at him and I was like, what are you talking about?
[01:26:00.064 --> 01:26:00.745]  He goes, you'll see.
[01:26:00.765 --> 01:26:02.947]  They'll start contaminating our air.
[01:26:03.728 --> 01:26:14.742]  And then, July 7th, the day he died, I was there in his deathbed with my brother Joe and my sister Jenny, and he told me two things.
[01:26:15.522 --> 01:26:16.704]  He said, number one, son,
[01:26:17.725 --> 01:26:20.527]  The globalist socialist storm is coming.
[01:26:21.328 --> 01:26:27.433]  I'm glad I don't have to live through it, but you're gonna have to live through it and fight through it, so get ready for it.
[01:26:28.234 --> 01:26:33.458]  And the second thing he told me was never deny your thirst for knowledge when it hits you.
[01:26:33.998 --> 01:26:36.240]  The thirst for knowledge is gonna hit you, boy.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:41.944]  And when it does, don't deny it, don't ignore it, just go with it and let it flow.
[01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:47.629]  And after that, I was just sitting there, I was like, Dad, I've only read a couple science fiction novels, you know?
[01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:49.870]  I've only read the, you know, Sports Illustrated.
[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:51.171]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:52.232 --> 01:27:00.177]  But, you know, I wish you, you know, I miss my father so much, and I need him here more than ever to talk to me about what's really going on.
[01:27:00.217 --> 01:27:10.084]  But after reading his books and doing my personal research, when he was talking about the stuff being put in the air, like contaminating our air like they're contaminating our water,
[01:27:10.945 --> 01:27:17.950]  These chemtrails that I see in the sky, these chemtrails that I see everywhere, I mean, people gotta know.
[01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:24.714]  It's being added to the jet fuel, even the pilots don't know now, and they have some that is special modification that are specially rigged, but we have the patents.
[01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:31.419]  Shifting gears, your father, because I did the research, I know it was connected in with Larry McDonnell, Congressman, and others,
[01:27:33.155 --> 01:27:45.027]  Was the first at so many levels to really crystallize how they controlled the left and the right, how they would bring in this system, how they would use the Green Movement, how the ultra-rich funded the communists?
[01:27:45.788 --> 01:27:47.569]  How did your dad get this much knowledge?
[01:27:47.609 --> 01:27:50.693]  Because we can sit here in 2012 and go, oh yeah, we all know this.
[01:27:51.053 --> 01:27:51.834]  How did he know it in 1970?
[01:27:54.147 --> 01:28:06.033]  You know, Alex, my dad was definitely the smartest man that I've ever met in my life, and I'm sure my huge family, my seven brothers and three sisters can back me up on that.
[01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:12.276]  But as far as where he got the knowledge, I mean, he was a good friend of Ron Paul.
[01:28:12.556 --> 01:28:13.557]  He was a part of the
[01:28:14.637 --> 01:28:17.598]  I'm pretty sure he was involved with the Reagan administration.
[01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:19.318]  I mean, he just had a lot of friends.
[01:28:19.438 --> 01:28:19.798]  No, no, no.
[01:28:20.158 --> 01:28:20.518]  No, I know.
[01:28:20.578 --> 01:28:21.359]  In fact, that's what I read.
[01:28:21.399 --> 01:28:24.699]  Your dad and Gary Allen were helping wake Ronald Reagan up about the New World Order.
[01:28:25.019 --> 01:28:29.440]  And that's why he was getting, you know, the John Birch information.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.761]  Reagan was really coming along.
[01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:36.042]  And then, of course, we all know the vice president they made him take and everything that happened then.
[01:28:37.324 --> 01:28:43.492]  Yeah, when he took Bush as the Vice President, even my brother Kai said it.
[01:28:43.512 --> 01:28:45.996]  He was just like, why is he taking this guy?
[01:28:46.016 --> 01:28:50.742]  I mean, we gotta remember that Bush was the Director of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:28:51.584 --> 01:29:00.452]  You know, there is a real agenda going on here, and what people have to wake up to is that there's a presidential bloodline.
[01:29:00.472 --> 01:29:06.598]  I mean, if people don't know, Barack Obama, he's an 11th cousin of George Bush Jr., and George Bush Jr.
[01:29:06.678 --> 01:29:10.401]  is a 3rd cousin of Al Gore and John Kerry, who's a bloodline of George
[01:29:10.441 --> 01:29:11.282]  But it's worse than that.
[01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:16.906]  I mean, it's like a breed of dog where all French bulldogs are related, or all Dobermans are related, or all, you know, pit bulls.
[01:29:17.767 --> 01:29:20.849]  I mean, they've done the maps on Ancestry.com.
[01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.071]  Obama is related to Cheney.
[01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:24.872]  And then he's, they're all related.
[01:29:24.932 --> 01:29:29.275]  It's like, they're all, and I don't mean like, I'm talking third, fourth cousins and stuff, you know.
[01:29:29.496 --> 01:29:30.957]  It's not like distantly related.
[01:29:31.477 --> 01:29:33.519]  Oh no, it's not distantly related at all.
[01:29:33.599 --> 01:29:46.029]  This is a very tight bloodline that stretches all the way back to the British monarchy, and the British monarchy stretches back to the Arab kings of Seville, which are descendants of Muhammad.
[01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:52.875]  People have to realize that this bloodline, this ruling bloodline, has been going on- Hold on, stay there, stay there!
[01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:55.057]  We're on the march.
[01:29:55.537 --> 01:29:57.078]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:00.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:10.654]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.

[01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:08.340]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.541]  Don't be one of them!

[01:33:06.519 --> 01:33:08.019]  We are on the march.
[01:33:08.379 --> 01:33:10.780]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:11.541 --> 01:33:15.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:33.101]  I want our guest to repeat what his father said to him before he died.
[01:33:33.121 --> 01:33:35.641]  The exact words are powerful.
[01:33:35.721 --> 01:33:40.903]  The global socialist super storm is coming.
[01:33:40.943 --> 01:33:47.325]  What was the exact quote that your father, co-author of None Dare Call a Conspiracy, told you, Josh Abraham?
[01:33:48.929 --> 01:33:55.713]  Um, what he told me on his deathbed, um, was the globalist socialist storm is coming.
[01:33:56.133 --> 01:33:57.874]  And we all need to get ready for it.
[01:33:58.315 --> 01:34:11.883]  That this world that we live in, this so-called democracy, and Gerald Solente, he's my favorite guest, he said it better himself, this is a Republican and Democratic criminal syndicate of the United States government.
[01:34:11.923 --> 01:34:12.923]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:34:12.943 --> 01:34:14.945]  Power-tripping Luciferians as well.
[01:34:14.985 --> 01:34:17.026]  I mean, they're just absolutely evil.
[01:34:17.765 --> 01:34:22.269]  Yeah, and he warned me, you know, the globalist socialist storm is coming.
[01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:27.134]  And then he told me, never deny your thirst for knowledge once it hits you.
[01:34:27.154 --> 01:34:31.998]  I mean, this is my father telling me that I'm gonna, you know, do something.
[01:34:32.058 --> 01:34:34.541]  Like, I had no thirst for knowledge, Alex.
[01:34:34.641 --> 01:34:36.663]  I had no want to read books.
[01:34:36.703 --> 01:34:37.424]  And let me tell you,
[01:34:38.064 --> 01:34:49.222]  In the past two years, I've read the entire King James Bible, all three of my dad's books, Michael Tessarion, I've read David Icke, I've read the book of Ostara, I've read, um...
[01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.669]  What was that?
[01:35:10.863 --> 01:35:17.489]  I hope that, you know, the fellow that republished your dad's book, Died of Cancer, just two weeks ago.
[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:23.475]  I hope the book continues to be in print, but we've got some that are still available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:23.876 --> 01:35:25.017]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:35:25.037 --> 01:35:27.439]  Because talking about, none dare call it conspiracy.
[01:35:27.479 --> 01:35:31.043]  Guys, give me a document cam shot in here for TV viewers so they can see this.
[01:35:31.443 --> 01:35:33.866]  These graphs in here that are so simple to
[01:35:34.386 --> 01:35:40.511]  But beautifully explain what people will never be taught in mainline political science classes.
[01:35:40.952 --> 01:35:47.898]  Now when you get up to PhD level, they'll actually teach you this, but only because you've got to work for the system and they'll explain to you why it's a good thing.
[01:35:47.918 --> 01:35:52.021]  But zooming in here, it explains democratic socialism.
[01:35:52.882 --> 01:36:02.590]  The cover, and it goes through how it controls labor, finance, business, legislative, judiciary, state, county, city, charity, politics, education, and a unified corporate global system.
[01:36:03.831 --> 01:36:10.456]  And so it's an off-the-shelf program they download into your government, and that they buy off the government through fiat fractional reserve banking.
[01:36:10.476 --> 01:36:11.617]  Your dad breaks all that down.
[01:36:11.657 --> 01:36:13.599]  Here we are 40 years later, it's all come true.
[01:36:14.219 --> 01:36:17.102]  Versus Constitutional Republic and how it operates.
[01:36:17.982 --> 01:36:23.205]  You've got the maps in here on the pressure from above, pressure from below.
[01:36:23.725 --> 01:36:39.153]  It breaks down Carol Quigley, JP Morgan, how they operated, how the Federal Reserve puts you into debt to then totally implode you down the road, how they devalue the dollar, Woodrow Wilson, how the British intelligence operation is working on this.
[01:36:40.093 --> 01:36:43.074]  The Rothschilds, it's got photos of them in here.
[01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:47.816]  It's got Khrushchev being funded by our own government, with Nelson Rockefeller.
[01:36:48.537 --> 01:36:51.098]  It's got the pressure from above, pressure from below.
[01:36:51.118 --> 01:36:56.580]  It's got how Kissinger was going to get us off the gold standard, and it all came true.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:57.941]  It's all in here.
[01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:04.244]  How the CFR manipulates the Republican and Democratic parties was very simple.
[01:37:04.784 --> 01:37:10.988]  But the true mark of genius is something simple that simply explains something with great depth and accuracy.
[01:37:11.548 --> 01:37:19.553]  That's got how the Wahlbergs funding the Nazis, trying to find the pressure from above, how they fund the poor people.
[01:37:20.593 --> 01:37:23.175]  To then get rid of the middle class for the mega bankers.
[01:37:23.775 --> 01:37:28.738]  Anything else you'd like to add about this book and I mean what it was like to read it after your dad was dead?
[01:37:30.459 --> 01:37:43.107]  Well, it was very eye-opening and to say the least it kind of Woke me up to like imagine this Alex like imagine you and me knowing this information, okay?
[01:37:44.298 --> 01:37:47.624]  You know, I listen to your show a lot, and you talk about the Matrix.
[01:37:47.704 --> 01:37:49.106]  You gotta think of it like this.
[01:37:49.847 --> 01:37:55.016]  If you were in the Matrix, if the Matrix was actually real, and you were jacked in,
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:02.848]  And you know, you were like Neo or Trinity getting in and out of the Matrix, but what if you were stuck in there and you couldn't jack out?
[01:38:03.268 --> 01:38:05.751]  You couldn't come back out of the Matrix into the real world.
[01:38:05.811 --> 01:38:07.452]  What if you were stuck in the Matrix?
[01:38:08.073 --> 01:38:08.854]  What would you do?
[01:38:08.874 --> 01:38:15.961]  And that's the kind of mind frame that I have been stuck in ever since I've come across this knowledge and read my father's books.
[01:38:16.382 --> 01:38:17.563]  He nailed it to a T.
[01:38:18.584 --> 01:38:25.166]  And what's really compelling is that he even gives the list of names and what organizations they work for.
[01:38:25.827 --> 01:38:33.569]  And when you read up on all this knowledge, you ask yourself the question, what can I do about this?
[01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:40.432]  And me being my father's son, you know, I'm the only one of my brothers who don't have a family and kids.
[01:38:41.213 --> 01:38:42.754]  I just turned 30 years old.
[01:38:42.874 --> 01:38:49.240]  I'm the last one left who really has like a clean slate and can really do anything without putting my hair in it.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:56.166]  So your dad basically told you you were going to get the anointing, and that's what it is, to continue on his mission.
[01:38:56.206 --> 01:38:57.267]  He could see that in you.
[01:38:57.568 --> 01:38:58.448]  That's just amazing.
[01:38:59.429 --> 01:39:00.270]  Well, I don't know.
[01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:02.953]  He didn't say anointing, but you know, he knew
[01:39:03.993 --> 01:39:05.714]  You know, that's what it is.
[01:39:05.754 --> 01:39:09.935]  I mean, to anoint somebody, if you choose the technical term, is I'm saying this is your mission.
[01:39:10.075 --> 01:39:11.896]  I'm saying you're going to fulfill this.
[01:39:12.256 --> 01:39:16.718]  And my mission is to reach people who are going to be the leaders that will defeat the New World Order.
[01:39:17.058 --> 01:39:24.501]  I've always known in my heart and my gut that from the time I started that I never intended to try to be this large force out there.
[01:39:24.941 --> 01:39:27.942]  I was there to set brush fires in the minds of other men and women.
[01:39:28.382 --> 01:39:29.563]  And of course, that's what we do today.
[01:39:29.583 --> 01:39:34.589]  I mean, even most of my detractors will say, you woke me up, but now I'm going to come after you.
[01:39:34.609 --> 01:39:39.574]  But that's because they were an imp... None of us are perfect, but a really imperfect, deformed vessel.
[01:39:40.115 --> 01:39:42.478]  But, you know, some of the seeds are going to fall on the rocks.
[01:39:42.818 --> 01:39:43.959]  Some are going to be eaten by the birds.
[01:39:44.079 --> 01:39:45.401]  Others are going to hit the right soil.
[01:39:45.441 --> 01:39:46.602]  And that's what's happening.
[01:39:46.622 --> 01:39:47.183]  Please continue.
[01:39:48.473 --> 01:40:05.182]  Well you're absolutely right you know and obviously you and me we got friends and family we try to wake you know I'm trying to wake my own family up to this whole mess called a conspiracy and they don't believe it you know I try trying to convince my mom like mom
[01:40:05.482 --> 01:40:20.195]  Okay, so your dad is a famous paleo-constitutionalist, friends with Ron Paul, Congressman Larry McDonald who they killed, Gary Allen, Icon, I knew he knew Bob Chapman, all these people and they don't even respect an icon in their family.
[01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:31.518]  Well, me, my brother Kai, and my brother Joe are pretty much the only ones out of the 11 children that have read my father's books.
[01:40:31.638 --> 01:40:32.299]  Unbelievable!
[01:40:32.679 --> 01:40:33.179]  Unbelievable!
[01:40:33.199 --> 01:40:33.900]  Unbelievable!
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.782]  And what really strikes me as crazy
[01:40:37.563 --> 01:40:41.906]  Is that, you know, we, here we are with all the evidence.
[01:40:41.986 --> 01:40:47.109]  We got him, Alex, in your infiltration video of the build of a Bohemian Grove.
[01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:49.231]  That is like one of my favorite.
[01:40:49.691 --> 01:40:51.552]  I just love sitting down and watching that.
[01:40:51.853 --> 01:41:04.521]  The cremation of care is so interesting to watch because what you gotta come to grips with is that that is a 2,000 year old Babylonian satanic ritual of human sacrifice.
[01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:05.914]  They're recreating it.
[01:41:06.435 --> 01:41:07.175]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:07.636 --> 01:41:14.703]  In closing, anything else you'd like to add for people about your father, about the book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, about Gary Allen?
[01:41:15.899 --> 01:41:19.982]  Yeah, in closing, um, I'd like to say we gotta keep talking, Alex.
[01:41:20.022 --> 01:41:24.126]  You and me, we gotta, uh, this isn't gonna be the last time I hope I come on your show.
[01:41:24.746 --> 01:41:34.734]  Because there's a lot of research that I've been doing, and a lot of people tend to forget that my father wrote another great book that is my personal favorite called The Greening.
[01:41:34.914 --> 01:41:41.200]  And The Greening is the total rap sheet of what the globalists are doing today.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.842]  Right now, in front of our faces.
[01:41:43.882 --> 01:41:45.243]  Well listen, is that book in print?
[01:41:45.968 --> 01:41:46.931]  Oh, it's in print!
[01:41:46.951 --> 01:41:48.735]  It was published in the early 90s.
[01:41:48.835 --> 01:41:52.463]  I got a copy of it right here in my hand.
[01:41:52.583 --> 01:41:53.606]  The greening!
[01:41:53.899 --> 01:41:55.980]  Well, we're going to have to carry that in the bookstore, absolutely.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.842]  We'll get you on the Nightly News soon, after about a chance to read the Greening, or one of my reporters has, and we'll do a review of that.
[01:42:02.223 --> 01:42:13.628]  Great having you on, my friend, and we salute your work, we salute your father, and there's nothing more honorable than carrying on the work of your father, especially when your father was doing such seminal work.
[01:42:14.648 --> 01:42:22.792]  If I have to, the touchstone of so much of the liberty movement we've got today, that is our greatest hope, is the work of your father and Gary Allen.
[01:42:22.812 --> 01:42:23.292]  God bless you.
[01:42:24.127 --> 01:42:28.791]  Yeah, and thank you for having me on, Alex, and I really hope this isn't the last time I come on.
[01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:40.942]  What I wanted to ask you is that I'm thinking about writing my own book, and I think it would be a very powerful message if you and me came together.
[01:42:40.962 --> 01:42:45.466]  Yeah, the problem is, listen, I'm not bragging, I've been offered by big New York publishing houses
[01:42:46.147 --> 01:42:54.540]  You know, all these big book deals and stuff, and my problem is, is that I would make a bunch of money, and books are great too, but it doesn't reach as many people.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:43:00.789]  I can do a special report that reaches a million people, boom, on YouTube, outside of the radio audience that's woken up.
[01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:08.495]  And then a book, you know, that would make me $20 million would only reach, you know, 300, 400,000, 500,000 people.
[01:43:08.875 --> 01:43:11.417]  And I understand, but listen, just write your book.
[01:43:11.477 --> 01:43:12.878]  Don't wait for me to work with you on it.
[01:43:12.898 --> 01:43:14.399]  I appreciate you joining us, my friend.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:16.041]  Thank you.
[01:43:16.061 --> 01:43:17.482]  We're going to move on to some calls now.
[01:43:19.463 --> 01:43:35.675]  Yeah, I just, uh, you know, I had a bad experience with, uh, Ghostwriters, uh, with two different ones with a publisher, and because I would say stuff and it would turn into something completely different, and then I'm so busy trying to complete the Nightly News, trying to finish that mission, trying to finish all the things, and I really...
[01:43:37.449 --> 01:43:46.832]  I probably will write some books because it's good to have something in writing, it's respected, and actually it would make a bunch of money, which I could then use to fund things.
[01:43:46.892 --> 01:43:54.714]  So now I am leaning more towards a book, but it's just I'm not going to put some crud out.
[01:43:55.964 --> 01:43:57.866]  You know, that's why I haven't made a film in two years.
[01:43:57.906 --> 01:44:02.010]  I mean, it's more of a presentation documentary with Joel Skousen, Strategic Relocation.
[01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:03.771]  It's more of a, I'm in it, he's in it.
[01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:05.393]  It's got a lot of great graphics and information.
[01:44:05.413 --> 01:44:08.956]  It's very important, but, you know, it's not a film film I made.
[01:44:12.259 --> 01:44:14.441]  Because, you know, I think I've gone on the right course, too.
[01:44:14.521 --> 01:44:15.262]  Films make money.
[01:44:16.897 --> 01:44:19.599]  And they are seen as prestigious and they reach a lot of people.
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.723]  But just churning out reports is getting more lead downrange on the globalists.
[01:44:27.332 --> 01:44:35.119]  But then I gotta do a money bomb, uh, where I can make a film and make, you know, you know, 500, 600 to 700,000 a million dollars, you know, if it's a big film.
[01:44:35.399 --> 01:44:46.550]  Um, if I did a film right, so I can make something like Dinesh D'Souza made, I could get it in theaters, I could probably hit the Zeitgeist right and get media behind it and make, you know, 15 million dollars, and that would fund us for like three years.
[01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:48.450]  So I'm trying to work smarter.
[01:44:48.490 --> 01:44:59.553]  I'm just so caught in radio every day, preparation for it, training crew, dealing with stuff, signing checks, carrying out trash, throwing people's, you know, you spent coffee in the trash.
[01:44:59.573 --> 01:45:06.595]  I'm not bashing folks, but running around, you know, you know, trying to get people up and going, because I know that's the right plan to go with.
[01:45:08.016 --> 01:45:10.376]  And that I, there's a lot of things I want to do.
[01:45:14.414 --> 01:45:18.077]  Well, I'll tell you right now, if somebody like Larry Abraham was alive, I'd write a book with him.
[01:45:18.638 --> 01:45:19.859]  And I think that's the answer.
[01:45:19.919 --> 01:45:27.185]  I think I need to go out and find an established writer, and then have them go out and then, you know, write books with me.
[01:45:28.146 --> 01:45:36.734]  Because I need to be able to just record, have the meetings, have the areas, have the writer put it together, add their research, and then put it out.
[01:45:36.794 --> 01:45:39.216]  Because let me tell you, there's just not that many people that have this knowledge.
[01:45:39.316 --> 01:45:40.638]  And I don't understand why you don't have it.
[01:45:41.206 --> 01:45:45.570]  I mean, I guess you've got to study this stuff for 17 years, but it's so self-evident.
[01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:48.332]  It's so... You've got to read Tragedy and Hope.
[01:45:48.352 --> 01:45:49.914]  You've got to read None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[01:45:50.274 --> 01:45:51.715]  You've got to read UN documents.
[01:45:51.735 --> 01:45:53.277]  You've got to just... You know...
[01:45:54.677 --> 01:45:56.118]  Learn and watch these people.
[01:45:56.158 --> 01:46:01.782]  And then you figure out, man, there are a bunch of crazy control freaks that think Lucifer controls them and they want to kill everybody.
[01:46:02.623 --> 01:46:06.005]  And then you, you know, and a cop pulls you over and goes, mind if I search your car?
[01:46:06.346 --> 01:46:07.727]  And you can't even get mad at the cop.
[01:46:07.747 --> 01:46:11.449]  This is a victim full of vaccines, full of fluoride, full of GMO.
[01:46:12.438 --> 01:46:17.541]  You know, they're going to die young, their wife's going to die young, their kids are going to die young, we're being murdered, and you can't even get mad at them.
[01:46:17.561 --> 01:46:18.401]  They're just a victim.
[01:46:19.101 --> 01:46:26.765]  And then some idiot TSA person, chosen because they're a low-grade moron who likes to exercise mindless power all day, you can't even get mad at them.
[01:46:26.805 --> 01:46:37.390]  But I realize you've got to get mad at them and put them down and say, you're pathetic, you're enjoying a power trip, shame on you, stop being a drama queen, stop acting like it's bad that I'm asking you questions.
[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:38.511]  Knock it off!
[01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:42.381]  We've got to rebuke others.
[01:46:42.421 --> 01:46:43.602]  We've got to rebuke ourselves.
[01:46:43.642 --> 01:46:45.022]  We've got to get better.
[01:46:45.902 --> 01:46:47.262]  Or it's all going to get bad.
[01:46:47.323 --> 01:46:52.464]  And listen, the socialist control freak superstorm is about to hit.
[01:46:52.624 --> 01:46:54.104]  Everything you've seen is just the beginning.
[01:46:54.564 --> 01:47:00.266]  Like when the trees are blowing, you think, oh, look at that storm coming, and it finally hits, and the windows are blowing out, and the tornado hits.
[01:47:00.546 --> 01:47:01.786]  Sounds like a freight train coming by.
[01:47:01.806 --> 01:47:03.987]  I've been in a tornado.
[01:47:04.247 --> 01:47:05.147]  I barely survived it.
[01:47:05.227 --> 01:47:05.607]  Not fun.
[01:47:07.905 --> 01:47:21.542]  And with my father, in a car, we're driving along, it's raining, we slow down, all of a sudden we're on about 40, blows the car off down an embankment, 40 foot embankment, go through fences, slide, run into two oak trees, police, state police said it would have killed us if we had hit sideways.
[01:47:22.604 --> 01:47:26.348]  Smashed the Tahoe all the way in to the
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.541]  Back row of seats forward.
[01:47:30.281 --> 01:47:32.302]  Broke my dad and mine's seats.
[01:47:33.442 --> 01:47:35.743]  They broke in the shock and then fell backwards.
[01:47:36.083 --> 01:47:37.103]  My dad got a concussion.
[01:47:37.123 --> 01:47:38.364]  He was throwing up everywhere.
[01:47:38.404 --> 01:47:42.085]  I got a concussion but didn't throw up because I guess my brain's already had so many concussions.
[01:47:42.125 --> 01:47:43.926]  It was like visiting an old friend.
[01:47:43.946 --> 01:47:47.587]  And the state police got there and I said, yeah, we slowed down and just blew up the road.
[01:47:47.607 --> 01:47:48.267]  He goes, yeah.
[01:47:49.468 --> 01:47:51.929]  The tornado just came through here up through Stonewall.
[01:47:52.289 --> 01:47:53.489]  The barn's blown over right over there.
[01:47:53.509 --> 01:47:53.990]  You see that?
[01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.990]  You got hit by a tornado.
[01:47:56.423 --> 01:47:57.324]  And that's what hit us.
[01:47:57.985 --> 01:47:59.466]  Did you see those trees torn down?
[01:47:59.586 --> 01:48:00.347]  That's a tornado.
[01:48:00.887 --> 01:48:02.349]  There's fire ants all over us.
[01:48:02.429 --> 01:48:05.091]  It was not fun, but I don't know why I'm telling that story again.
[01:48:05.131 --> 01:48:07.253]  I guess, how did I get off into tornadoes?
[01:48:07.293 --> 01:48:12.938]  The point is that this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:13.919 --> 01:48:18.063]  And these people want to rape your children and line you up in a pit and blow your head off.
[01:48:18.423 --> 01:48:19.725]  After working, you have to death.
[01:48:19.745 --> 01:48:21.146]  Okay, that's what they do.
[01:48:21.186 --> 01:48:21.947]  That's what they create.
[01:48:23.561 --> 01:48:26.003]  Grandma bakes pies and makes you a big chicken fried steak.
[01:48:26.023 --> 01:48:29.565]  New World Order puts poison in your water and kills you at the hospital.
[01:48:29.826 --> 01:48:30.906]  I mean, I'm sorry it's dark.
[01:48:30.966 --> 01:48:31.867]  I'm sorry it's horrible.
[01:48:32.047 --> 01:48:32.968]  I'm sorry it's ugly.
[01:48:33.328 --> 01:48:38.272]  But if we would admit what the Soviets and Nazis and Pol Pot and all these scum did, we don't have to relive it.
[01:48:39.472 --> 01:48:40.773]  But if we don't, we're going to relive it.
[01:48:40.813 --> 01:48:41.814]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:48:41.834 --> 01:48:42.415]  He wants to talk about 2012.
[01:48:42.495 --> 01:48:44.596]  We're talking about this pretty much every day.
[01:48:44.616 --> 01:48:48.419]  In the countdown towards the end of the world, they say, 21 days.
[01:48:48.519 --> 01:48:49.380]  I don't buy into it.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.881]  21 days, 5 hours, 11 minutes, 13 seconds.
[01:48:53.294 --> 01:48:57.755]  I guess the website that set this up is gone with their time zone, because the world will end in their time zone on that day.
[01:48:57.995 --> 01:48:58.755]  That's another question.
[01:48:59.415 --> 01:49:00.956]  Which time zone will it end in?
[01:49:01.196 --> 01:49:02.356]  Maybe Greenwich Mean Time?
[01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:04.096]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:49:04.116 --> 01:49:07.977]  Oh, he just dropped off as I went to him.
[01:49:08.017 --> 01:49:08.517]  I love that.
[01:49:09.297 --> 01:49:12.038]  Wilson in Florida, 2012 in the Constitution.
[01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:12.438]  Go ahead.
[01:49:13.738 --> 01:49:15.098]  Hey, good afternoon Alex.
[01:49:15.178 --> 01:49:16.719]  It's always a pleasure to speak to you.
[01:49:18.297 --> 01:49:20.998]  I just wanted to speak in regards to really quickly to 2012.
[01:49:21.218 --> 01:49:26.881]  I just think that, for sure, if there's going to be anything, it's going to be coming from the government.
[01:49:26.901 --> 01:49:34.785]  I don't think anything on this earth is going to be happening naturally like that, especially with the way things are.
[01:49:35.145 --> 01:49:37.366]  I agree, but I mean, they could do an EMP or something.
[01:49:37.386 --> 01:49:39.807]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I don't say exactly.
[01:49:39.867 --> 01:49:40.407]  I agree with you.
[01:49:40.528 --> 01:49:42.929]  And we'll probably see some Hale-Bopp type activity too.
[01:49:42.949 --> 01:49:43.249]  Go ahead.
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:46.421]  And I'm definitely glad.
[01:49:46.441 --> 01:49:55.765]  You know, the last shows I've been listening to for the last few weeks, you've been just beating the drums, speaking about how the answer is in the tools that our founders gave us.
[01:49:55.785 --> 01:49:59.187]  You know, I don't like getting obsessed with characters or people.
[01:49:59.527 --> 01:50:00.708]  I'm not a fan of anybody.
[01:50:00.888 --> 01:50:04.810]  I'm a fan of the tools that we have, and I'm glad that you just keep emphasizing it.
[01:50:05.150 --> 01:50:06.711]  And I think that's just where the key lies.
[01:50:06.731 --> 01:50:11.313]  You know, we have the tools, and we just have to have the organization, and then we all use the tools.
[01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:16.382]  I agree with you because of the children that I hear in the background.
[01:50:16.402 --> 01:50:19.123]  I mean, we cannot turn our children over to the beast.
[01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:22.544]  And what matters is their hearts and their minds and their souls.
[01:50:23.084 --> 01:50:26.705]  People need to understand, folks, you do not want to be programmed by this.
[01:50:26.946 --> 01:50:31.087]  That's the most valuable thing in life, is being conscious and living in reality.
[01:50:31.707 --> 01:50:33.070]  And it doesn't mean any of us are perfect.
[01:50:33.090 --> 01:50:34.612]  We all see through rose-colored glasses.
[01:50:35.113 --> 01:50:38.058]  But we have just got to ask God to open up our hearts.
[01:50:38.479 --> 01:50:40.703]  And I'm not talking about the fake God in these churches, folks.
[01:50:41.203 --> 01:50:45.250]  If you ask the creator of the universe into your heart and to give you guidance, you'll find it.
[01:50:46.389 --> 01:50:49.312]  And it's now time to hit your knees, folks.
[01:50:49.432 --> 01:50:56.217]  Even if you don't believe in the spiritual world, well then you better get in a room and turn the lights down and just sit down and meditate and think about where the world's going.
[01:50:56.237 --> 01:51:02.483]  Because let me tell you, you've got to be in deep bondage to not know we are in grave danger.
[01:51:05.287 --> 01:51:11.551]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:14.333]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:51:14.413 --> 01:51:14.713]  The U.S.
[01:51:14.773 --> 01:51:18.896]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:51:19.016 --> 01:51:21.578]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:51:21.978 --> 01:51:23.219]  They want that attack to come.
[01:51:23.459 --> 01:51:29.663]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:51:30.043 --> 01:51:32.507]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:51:32.707 --> 01:51:37.495]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:51:37.675 --> 01:51:45.107]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:51:45.407 --> 01:51:47.950]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:51:48.170 --> 01:51:50.792]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:51:51.293 --> 01:51:55.517]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:54:05.084 --> 01:54:29.397]  By the way, we have only put out four issues of InfoWars Magazine.
[01:54:30.678 --> 01:54:33.920]  And I would say overall, before I go back to your calls and our next guest,
[01:54:35.251 --> 01:54:45.840]  I am very excited about it, and it has overperformed in the quality, in the sales, in the subscriptions, what I even expected.
[01:54:46.961 --> 01:54:55.629]  But, because we're always adding stuff right up to the date of publishing it, about four or five days before it comes out and we have it printed, there are typos in it sometimes.
[01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:58.052]  And we're really working on that.
[01:54:58.853 --> 01:55:03.801]  It caused kind of a customer service nightmare when we had two Octobers.
[01:55:04.101 --> 01:55:07.286]  Yes, because we had an October come out.
[01:55:11.041 --> 01:55:17.563]  At the start of October, and then because we were about to print it right at the end of October, there was an oversight that it said October on the front.
[01:55:17.583 --> 01:55:19.844]  So there were two Octobers, an early and a late.
[01:55:20.385 --> 01:55:26.847]  It's just, it's kind of cool, you know, because it's a real magazine with our articles and research, but little oversight.
[01:55:26.887 --> 01:55:31.729]  I've noticed though in mainstream stuff, you see more and more typos and things because people are using spell checkers.
[01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:38.696]  And they expect that if a spell checker says, it's fine, it's fine, so then you'll have just the wrong words in there and things.
[01:55:39.257 --> 01:55:43.181]  But there's not as many typos in the new issue, InfoWars Magazine.
[01:55:43.562 --> 01:55:47.787]  This man wants your guns, and it even has the right month on the cover, December 2012.
[01:55:50.327 --> 01:55:54.169]  And everybody that signs up for a subscription right now, you'll get a couple back issues.
[01:55:54.549 --> 01:55:58.712]  All supplies last added into the first one of the next 11 that come out.
[01:55:59.332 --> 01:56:02.674]  And this is undoubtedly the best one we have produced.
[01:56:02.714 --> 01:56:03.614]  They just get better and better.
[01:56:03.654 --> 01:56:07.016]  It's got Obama on the front, standing on the American flag or sitting on it.
[01:56:07.036 --> 01:56:08.737]  And it says, this man wants your guns.
[01:56:08.777 --> 01:56:13.119]  And it's all about his agenda for the next four years, the globalist agenda.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:15.541]  And it really wakes people up.
[01:56:16.684 --> 01:56:23.588]  And I am just so proud of this new publication and it exposes everything.
[01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:26.330]  Obama wants your guns and the rest of your freedom.
[01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:30.333]  Second Amendment in the crosshairs with all their quotes, all the proof.
[01:56:31.913 --> 01:56:34.815]  It's got just all the factoids.
[01:56:34.875 --> 01:56:38.778]  It's got information on how they're going to shut down the power plants, the latest proof.
[01:56:40.099 --> 01:56:44.821]  And probably my favorite article in here other than the Ron Paul's entire farewell speech printed on four pages.
[01:56:46.155 --> 01:56:46.675]  I don't know.
[01:57:07.373 --> 01:57:10.474]  It really is a phenomenal publication.
[01:57:10.835 --> 01:57:17.898]  You can buy them in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost or get a subscription and it's a great gift to give as well.
[01:57:18.378 --> 01:57:20.859]  And by the way, I guess people are hot on Ron Paul.
[01:57:20.919 --> 01:57:23.700]  Our financial implosion first issue sold out.
[01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:27.822]  Close to 40,000 copies that we had extra that we didn't put on the street.
[01:57:27.882 --> 01:57:30.103]  We put 60,000 on the street or whatever and 40,000 extra.
[01:57:32.992 --> 01:57:35.173]  Sold out in less than two days.
[01:57:35.794 --> 01:57:43.738]  This, because we printed 100,000 of these and are then holding back 20,000 or so for subscriptions and to sell in bulk at cost.
[01:57:44.319 --> 01:57:47.460]  This looks like it's going to sell out in about four or five days at current rates.
[01:57:47.861 --> 01:57:51.223]  So if you want these in bulk at cost with complete Ron Paul farewell address,
[01:57:52.163 --> 01:57:57.330]  And all the other info to give somebody to warn them about the attack on the Second Amendment, then you need to get your subscription.
[01:57:57.910 --> 01:58:07.242]  Obviously, we'll hold something back to cover all the subscriptions, but if you want to buy them in bulk, now is the time to get InfoWars Magazine and InfoWarsStore.com and you'll get the double October issue.
[01:58:08.424 --> 01:58:23.725]  Which is related to the November issue about zombie mind control In there, but we're adding more proofreaders and stuff because we always get it right down to the last day And then we proofread it, but people aren't in a conscious mode and so stuff like that gets gets missed
[01:58:24.648 --> 01:58:38.276]  But anyways, Real Grassroots, Print 2.0, and you can also sign up at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, and always five days after the magazine comes out, we'll send you a free digital copy where the links work and everything, and you can turn the pages.
[01:58:38.596 --> 01:58:42.619]  You can sign up for free to get the magazine digital copy at InfoWars.com.

[01:58:56.092 --> 01:59:00.936]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:59:01.657 --> 01:59:04.440]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.242]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:59:07.702 --> 01:59:10.285]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:59:10.725 --> 01:59:13.728]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:59:14.228 --> 01:59:18.854]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:59:19.434 --> 01:59:21.557]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:59:22.097 --> 01:59:25.161]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

[01:59:57.675 --> 01:59:59.595]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:00.055 --> 02:00:02.836]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:13.562]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:14.222 --> 02:00:15.022]  You want answers?
[02:00:15.803 --> 02:00:16.703]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:20.985]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:21.545 --> 02:00:25.587]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.732 --> 02:00:30.895]  Alright, we're going to take some calls in this short segment.
[02:00:30.915 --> 02:00:35.521]  Then we have the author, researcher of Nuclear Roulette joining us.
[02:00:35.541 --> 02:00:38.946]  Then I'll continue with some of the other world news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:00:40.147 --> 02:00:42.971]  But they are announcing massive
[02:00:44.253 --> 02:00:48.377]  Massive, absolutely massive tax increases.
[02:00:48.437 --> 02:00:55.443]  Not just the new income tax increases, but a bunch of other VAT, you name it, all go to foreign banks basically.
[02:00:56.464 --> 02:00:59.066]  So we'll be breaking all of that down coming up right now.
[02:00:59.106 --> 02:01:01.188]  Let's go to your call, Steven, New Jersey.
[02:01:01.769 --> 02:01:02.650]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:04.751]  Hi Alex.
[02:01:05.112 --> 02:01:05.452]  Hey buddy.
[02:01:06.493 --> 02:01:07.033]  How's it going?
[02:01:07.174 --> 02:01:07.454]  Pretty good.
[02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:21.927]  I'm just calling to talk about... I wanted to see if you knew about the Merkabah meditation and how people that were doing the meditation all over the world were having experiences with black helicopters monitoring them.
[02:01:23.812 --> 02:01:36.037]  No, I mean, there's a lot of stuff people claim that I can't prove, but I mean, I know that the government is into psychic stuff and, you know, has the psychic soldier programs and all that, that's been declassified, and the system does believe in it.
[02:01:36.737 --> 02:01:42.919]  You know, I know everybody's got a little bit of sixth sense, and I know there are things that are not understood.
[02:01:43.399 --> 02:01:45.960]  I know I've had many experiences of dreams that come 100% true.
[02:01:47.701 --> 02:01:48.302]  And other things.
[02:01:48.322 --> 02:01:49.863]  So I know there's stuff going on out there.
[02:01:50.824 --> 02:01:53.347]  And I know the system wants to suppress that for the general public.
[02:01:53.667 --> 02:01:57.090]  The problem is, is there's so much quackery and baloney involved in it as well.
[02:01:58.311 --> 02:01:59.052]  Oh yeah, of course.
[02:01:59.432 --> 02:02:02.495]  Well actually, I got these books.
[02:02:02.796 --> 02:02:07.480]  One of them is called The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life by Jirnvala Malkizadeh.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.261]  I could have to do it.
[02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:22.219]  You know, Sacred Geometry of the Flower of Life, it teaches you how to do the Merkabah Meditation, and I actually did it myself, and, well, it went against their, you know, you're supposed to actually take the course, because it can be dangerous, but I did do it myself.
[02:02:22.519 --> 02:02:35.991]  It took a long time, and I was able to do the meditation properly, and it took place in Queens, at the Alley Pond Environmental Center, two gigantic, super high-tech,
[02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:41.095]  Helicopters flew right past me after I had activated.
[02:02:41.115 --> 02:02:42.656]  Yeah, but they're constantly flying around.
[02:02:42.696 --> 02:02:44.578]  It's all part of the establishment.
[02:02:44.758 --> 02:02:47.800]  I mean, there's helicopters swarming everywhere, where I live at least.
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.902]  Black helicopters, green ones, drones.
[02:02:50.342 --> 02:02:51.723]  Everybody I know is seeing drones.
[02:02:51.783 --> 02:02:52.644]  I've seen them twice.
[02:02:52.664 --> 02:02:59.510]  I mean, I saw a predator, excuse me, a global hawk bigger than Dallas, but couldn't get the camera going on the highway by the time it's gone over.
[02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:04.333]  I mean, it was like going almost stall speed, like 100 miles an hour, it looked like, or less.
[02:03:05.134 --> 02:03:10.096]  And I mean, it was a Global Hawk or something just like it, and I saw that little drone that I got video of that the highway department had.
[02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:12.037]  I mean, I got video.
[02:03:12.077 --> 02:03:12.617]  I pulled over.
[02:03:12.637 --> 02:03:13.337]  That was the controller.
[02:03:13.357 --> 02:03:14.117]  I got video of that.
[02:03:15.338 --> 02:03:18.139]  Rob Duce's sister saw the police running him on the hike and bike trail.
[02:03:19.039 --> 02:03:19.539]  That's another thing.
[02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:21.880]  Now they got police on the hike and bike trail running around.
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:23.241]  It's just no end to it.
[02:03:23.921 --> 02:03:26.522]  But the illegal aliens are, you know, doing whatever they want downtown.
[02:03:26.942 --> 02:03:27.602]  Good to hear from you.
[02:03:27.622 --> 02:03:28.623]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:29.323 --> 02:03:30.884]  Dylan in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:03:31.284 --> 02:03:31.864]  Quick, go ahead.
[02:03:33.001 --> 02:03:34.122]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:03:34.383 --> 02:03:36.144]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[02:03:36.845 --> 02:03:46.575]  And I just want to say, all this 2012 stuff, we know the world's not gonna end, but I think it will be a perfect opportunity for the government to take advantage of every kind of propaganda that I've seen all up.
[02:03:47.296 --> 02:03:49.899]  And you know, it's to come and get the gun, to get TSA on the street.
[02:03:50.299 --> 02:03:53.323]  And I just wanted to know what you thought about all that, and what's your opinion on it?
[02:03:53.854 --> 02:03:54.354]  Well, yeah.
[02:03:54.414 --> 02:03:59.759]  I mean, governments always want a goon force that doesn't even have to go to a law enforcement or police college.
[02:03:59.779 --> 02:04:00.800]  And that's what TSA is.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:05.323]  They're setting the precedent where they can give somebody a two-week course and have them come take your guns.
[02:04:05.403 --> 02:04:08.466]  I mean, that's the new, you know, minimum wage goon force.
[02:04:08.986 --> 02:04:09.907]  But I don't, who knows?
[02:04:09.967 --> 02:04:11.348]  I'm sure there'll be some suicides.
[02:04:11.388 --> 02:04:15.071]  I'm sure there'll be some craziness just because of the incredible media hype.
[02:04:15.111 --> 02:04:19.715]  I mean, a lot of people think the world's going to end in 21 days or 22 days or whatever it is.
[02:04:19.755 --> 02:04:21.617]  And it's just asinine.
[02:04:23.063 --> 02:04:26.589]  For me, that's the main clue right there, just how the media pops up and talks about it.
[02:04:27.209 --> 02:04:37.446]  And another thing about the TSA, just today I've seen three TSA, big SUV, TSA round-the-side lights, how the car pulled over, the highway and everything.
[02:04:37.466 --> 02:04:38.187]  It's crazy out here.
[02:04:38.621 --> 02:04:40.522]  Yeah, TSA pulling cars over.
[02:04:40.542 --> 02:04:41.023]  I know.
[02:04:41.303 --> 02:04:42.504]  They're right here in Austin now.
[02:04:43.264 --> 02:04:46.866]  Sometimes you'll see a big, giant, black-wheeled tank drive by with Homeland Security on it.
[02:04:48.587 --> 02:04:50.369]  And they bug their eyes out at you too, man.
[02:04:50.389 --> 02:04:51.689]  You're an American scum.
[02:04:51.729 --> 02:04:53.851]  It's what an occupying army would act like.
[02:04:53.871 --> 02:04:55.532]  Well, actually, an occupying army would act friendlier.
[02:04:56.032 --> 02:04:58.594]  This is a group that hates you and hates your family.
[02:04:58.634 --> 02:04:59.034]  Literally.
[02:04:59.214 --> 02:05:00.415]  They just want to rope your family.
[02:05:00.695 --> 02:05:01.275]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.295 --> 02:05:01.636]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.869 --> 02:05:14.555]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:14.995 --> 02:05:18.618]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:19.058 --> 02:05:25.863]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:05:45.577 --> 02:05:47.198]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:47.558 --> 02:05:52.161]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:52.782 --> 02:05:55.944]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call

[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:10.544]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[02:06:10.864 --> 02:06:17.930]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[02:06:18.230 --> 02:06:20.672]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[02:06:20.972 --> 02:06:27.017]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[02:06:27.677 --> 02:06:30.459]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[02:06:30.719 --> 02:06:37.382]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[02:06:37.602 --> 02:06:42.705]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[02:06:42.905 --> 02:06:45.627]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer
[02:06:46.287 --> 02:06:48.590]  15% off the already lowest price.
[02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:50.993]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[02:06:51.253 --> 02:06:51.813]  ProPure.
[02:06:51.994 --> 02:06:57.980]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[02:06:58.841 --> 02:07:01.684]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:07:04.321 --> 02:07:07.103]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:07.364 --> 02:07:09.065]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[02:07:09.345 --> 02:07:12.668]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[02:07:12.969 --> 02:07:15.050]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:07:15.191 --> 02:07:18.613]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:18.814 --> 02:07:24.639]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:07:24.899 --> 02:07:28.282]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:07:28.602 --> 02:07:33.206]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:07:33.346 --> 02:07:39.071]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:07:39.331 --> 02:07:40.372]  And here's the best news.
[02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:43.495]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[02:07:43.755 --> 02:07:47.578]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[02:07:47.678 --> 02:07:55.383]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so, go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:07:55.523 --> 02:07:57.384]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:07:57.604 --> 02:07:59.665]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:07:59.785 --> 02:08:01.727]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:08:01.847 --> 02:08:03.628]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:08:07.443 --> 02:08:10.471]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:11.032 --> 02:08:15.162]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.113 --> 02:08:19.534]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:08:19.574 --> 02:08:21.934]  Eastern, we are here live.
[02:08:22.454 --> 02:08:26.696]  By the way, I talked to Joe Rogan two days ago and again yesterday.
[02:08:26.736 --> 02:08:27.436]  He's super busy.
[02:08:27.456 --> 02:08:28.236]  He's coming to town.
[02:08:28.256 --> 02:08:30.337]  I'm gonna go see him Saturday night.
[02:08:30.917 --> 02:08:39.839]  And he thought yesterday he could come on today, but he may come on tomorrow or he may come on next week just for Joe Rogan fans out there when I said he'd be on today.
[02:08:39.859 --> 02:08:45.181]  Or I may just interview him with a camera when I go out to dinner with him Saturday night.
[02:08:46.201 --> 02:08:49.823]  After his show, or before it, we'll see what happens with that.
[02:08:49.863 --> 02:08:54.525]  So that's just a program note that I just remembered because I was saying he'd probably be on Thursday.
[02:08:54.985 --> 02:09:04.049]  That is a busy guy with all the UFC TV shows, now doing a daily radio show a lot of the time, and the movies he's filming and everything else.
[02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:07.490]  I've known Joe for 13 years and seen him change quite a bit.
[02:09:08.150 --> 02:09:11.472]  Interesting fellow, so we'll work on getting that done.
[02:09:12.392 --> 02:09:15.913]  It's not hard to go out to dinner with Joe, but it's getting hard to get him on the radio.
[02:09:15.933 --> 02:09:22.816]  But I know how that is because I do so many radio interviews that I say no to most of them now because it just becomes a point where you just can't do them all.
[02:09:24.496 --> 02:09:26.257]  But we're going to work on that.
[02:09:27.648 --> 02:09:31.049]  Now folks, the Weekly Standard is asking the question.
[02:09:31.089 --> 02:09:33.090]  We can punch this up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:35.851]  Radio listeners can just go to DrudgeReport.com and see it.
[02:09:35.871 --> 02:09:38.212]  We also have it up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:39.712 --> 02:09:43.314]  Senator blasts secret fiscal cliff negotiations.
[02:09:44.054 --> 02:09:48.916]  And Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions is the one that exposed the total amnesty plan with Bush.
[02:09:49.556 --> 02:09:51.937]  That got shot down and now he's saying it's secret again.
[02:09:53.055 --> 02:10:06.884]  With the congressional leadership and that's why Romney's there today right now having lunch is to get the Republicans to go along with tax increases because the foreign banks, just like in Europe, they want that tax money.
[02:10:07.664 --> 02:10:13.568]  And so they'll say, oh, we're going to cut to cut the essential services and welfare, you know, off and federal money for police.
[02:10:13.848 --> 02:10:14.589]  They always do this.
[02:10:15.049 --> 02:10:15.910]  If you don't give us
[02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:18.311]  You know, the new tax increase on the rich.
[02:10:18.351 --> 02:10:22.313]  And meanwhile, Google, all these big companies are offshore and basically pay almost no tax.
[02:10:22.613 --> 02:10:23.253]  That's in the news.
[02:10:24.534 --> 02:10:27.596]  The ultra-rich are the ones lobbying for higher taxes.
[02:10:27.696 --> 02:10:30.697]  And the day the left figures this out is the day we save this country.
[02:10:31.257 --> 02:10:32.398]  But the right wing's the same.
[02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:33.979]  They love all their corporate welfare.
[02:10:34.019 --> 02:10:35.239]  They'll never recognize that.
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:38.201]  They're always saying, low-level socialists want higher taxes.
[02:10:38.221 --> 02:10:39.281]  Well, yeah, because they're ignorant.
[02:10:40.362 --> 02:10:42.183]  So, this is a big deal.
[02:10:43.223 --> 02:10:45.965]  And they want a VAT and a carbon.
[02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:49.717]  Which goes directly into the big multinationals as a derivative.
[02:10:49.757 --> 02:10:55.648]  And now the UN's saying they're going to have diplomatic immunity for people trading carbon taxes because a third of it's going to be given to the UN.
[02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:57.932]  Now they're going to give the banks diplomatic immunity?
[02:10:58.848 --> 02:11:00.690]  I mean, these banks are the world government.
[02:11:01.451 --> 02:11:02.932]  Remember our article we wrote a few months ago?
[02:11:03.473 --> 02:11:04.994]  Banks brag they've conquered the U.S.
[02:11:05.014 --> 02:11:05.395]  and Europe?
[02:11:06.016 --> 02:11:08.478]  It's dozens of links to video of them saying it.
[02:11:09.159 --> 02:11:10.781]  Federal Reserve Chairman, you name it.
[02:11:10.861 --> 02:11:11.702]  Go watch it.
[02:11:11.762 --> 02:11:12.462]  Go look at it.
[02:11:13.083 --> 02:11:15.586]  This is the key to understanding what we're facing.
[02:11:15.626 --> 02:11:17.007]  And here's my problem.
[02:11:17.027 --> 02:11:20.391]  You know, they say we want a global government because there's global problems and
[02:11:21.988 --> 02:11:24.830]  You know, all this environmental stuff, well, all they care about is the carbon.
[02:11:25.531 --> 02:11:28.653]  Carbon dioxide, that plants respirate from, the life cycle.
[02:11:29.454 --> 02:11:36.599]  They don't care about genetic engineering, they don't care about toxic waste dumping, or overfishing, or cutting down old-growth forests, or cross-species.
[02:11:36.699 --> 02:11:41.503]  All these things that we know are dangerous, and they don't care about the 400-plus nuclear reactors.
[02:11:42.023 --> 02:11:43.725]  Our own Energy Department estimates 92% are leaking.
[02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:46.590]  You can pull those numbers up.
[02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:49.012]  Just type in 90 plus percent of reactors leaking.
[02:11:49.373 --> 02:11:51.815]  Now when the alarms go off, they just decommission the alarms.
[02:11:52.616 --> 02:11:56.820]  Last year with Fukushima, the FDA, the EPA first, and then FDA agreed.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.704]  The EPA said, we're going to raise the level of different isotopes hundreds of times.
[02:12:01.424 --> 02:12:03.787]  Thousands of times for some isotopes as it came over.
[02:12:05.849 --> 02:12:07.230]  Okay, so things have really changed.
[02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:08.672]  They have the troops using DU.
[02:12:09.491 --> 02:12:13.755]  And you've got reactors leaking all over, 30, 40 years old, rotting.
[02:12:14.515 --> 02:12:16.617]  They're not going to the newer, cleaner systems.
[02:12:17.438 --> 02:12:21.381]  Now I see all these leading environmentalists like George Monbiot endorsing nuclear power.
[02:12:23.291 --> 02:12:24.151]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:12:24.472 --> 02:12:26.232]  I'm what you call a libertarian constitutionalist.
[02:12:26.773 --> 02:12:30.014]  Back when I was more ignorant, 15 years ago, I was all about nuclear power.
[02:12:30.255 --> 02:12:34.897]  But now they're rotting, falling apart, and the corporations don't care.
[02:12:35.117 --> 02:12:36.238]  They're crazy.
[02:12:37.058 --> 02:12:41.640]  And within a few weeks of power going out around the country, the diesel will run out.
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:44.181]  We've got an experimental reactor right here in Austin.
[02:12:44.522 --> 02:12:46.222]  Shout to me, a big power reactor.
[02:12:46.743 --> 02:12:48.644]  So I live in the fallout zone of two of these.
[02:12:49.485 --> 02:12:50.146]  And I don't like it.
[02:12:50.747 --> 02:12:52.088]  And now they want to build more of them.
[02:12:52.889 --> 02:12:54.131]  And run them shoddily.
[02:12:55.192 --> 02:12:58.136]  And so joining us is a leading expert on this, Nuclear Roulette.
[02:12:58.156 --> 02:12:59.798]  We sell the book at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:02.518 --> 02:13:05.960]  Forward by Jerry Mander and Ernst Kallenbach.
[02:13:06.401 --> 02:13:07.641]  And I have finally read the book.
[02:13:07.661 --> 02:13:08.882]  I wanted to get this guy on months ago.
[02:13:08.902 --> 02:13:14.186]  It came highly recommended by some of the physicists and people we've had on, Dr. Busby and others.
[02:13:14.266 --> 02:13:17.908]  Nuclear Roulette, The Truth About the Most Dangerous Energy Source on Earth.
[02:13:18.869 --> 02:13:24.272]  Gar Smith is editor emeritus of Earth Island Journal, a Project Censored Award winner.
[02:13:24.352 --> 02:13:25.773]  I'm a winner of that as well.
[02:13:26.293 --> 02:13:29.155]  Investigative journalist and co-founder of the Environmentalist Against War.
[02:13:30.316 --> 02:13:36.661]  He has covered revolutions in Central America and has engaged in environmental campaigns on three continents.
[02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:41.505]  He lives a low-impact, solar-assisted lifestyle in Berkeley, California.
[02:13:41.725 --> 02:13:48.050]  People say, well, why do you have a guy on, an environmentalist, when you're talking about the green movement and behind the green mask being the takeover?
[02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:54.074]  Because they attach all this real, reasonable stuff to something run by Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[02:13:54.094 --> 02:13:55.935]  Morgan that is a tax-based system.
[02:13:56.736 --> 02:14:02.299]  And so if we just fight the environmental movement, number one, it makes us look stupid, and it's not sophisticated.
[02:14:02.779 --> 02:14:08.763]  There's a real environmental movement, and there's a clone of it, but a counterfeit, but we're not going to get into that so much.
[02:14:08.783 --> 02:14:09.903]  I just wanted to throw that out.
[02:14:10.544 --> 02:14:25.072]  They don't even have to agree with everything somebody stands for, because I don't even know what the guy stands for in total, to understand that nuclear power is a ticking time bomb that just keeps going off, and now when they have leaks all the time in Nebraska or up in Canada, it's a footnote now.
[02:14:25.693 --> 02:14:29.569]  And radiation levels are more than double what they were 60 years ago in the Northern Hemisphere.
[02:14:30.575 --> 02:14:31.035]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:14:31.055 --> 02:14:34.437]  AP, radioactive leaks found at 75% of U.S.
[02:14:34.837 --> 02:14:35.898]  nuclear power sites.
[02:14:36.298 --> 02:14:39.159]  The Department of Energy estimates 92% worldwide.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.401]  But again, that's a whitewash as well.
[02:14:41.441 --> 02:14:42.241]  That's Associated Press.
[02:14:42.261 --> 02:14:43.001]  Okay, enough of me.
[02:14:43.342 --> 02:14:44.682]  Gar, good to get you on.
[02:14:45.002 --> 02:14:48.944]  Tell us about your environmental philosophy, because we all live on this island Earth.
[02:14:49.004 --> 02:14:49.445]  I agree with you.
[02:14:49.485 --> 02:14:50.205]  Spaceship Earth.
[02:14:51.066 --> 02:14:55.448]  And where do you see this going with the reactors that are just falling apart?
[02:14:57.213 --> 02:14:58.774]  Well, thank you for the invite, Alex.
[02:14:58.935 --> 02:15:01.637]  It's not a good future that we're facing.
[02:15:01.657 --> 02:15:10.906]  There's a lot of talk about the fiscal cliff, but anybody who's been living on planet Earth recently realizes that there's something else going on.
[02:15:11.186 --> 02:15:13.148]  We're facing a geophysical cliff.
[02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:19.934]  The weather is changing, and we've got reactors that were built for a different planet.
[02:15:21.935 --> 02:15:32.321]  The reactors that are operating today in their old age and their senescence, they should have been retired at the end of their lifestyles, their life design times.
[02:15:33.022 --> 02:15:45.970]  But out of a convenience to the industry, which has received convenience after convenience, gift after gift, bailout after bailout, these things are being re-licensed and allowed to be uprated, which means that they can operate hotter and harder.
[02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:52.455]  To generate more power for an industry that's not as efficient or as profitable as it used to be.
[02:15:53.657 --> 02:16:01.984]  And these reactors, even the NRC now admits, are more susceptible to earthquake risks than was realized.
[02:16:02.205 --> 02:16:05.808]  The medium risk is triple the design... Or flood risk!
[02:16:05.868 --> 02:16:08.431]  I mean, they're having to off-gas all the time when there's a moderate flood!
[02:16:09.417 --> 02:16:09.997]  That's right.
[02:16:10.157 --> 02:16:13.699]  These things are not leak-proof.
[02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:19.041]  They are admittedly designed to leak tritium, xenon.
[02:16:20.041 --> 02:16:30.145]  There are permissible amounts of radiation that can flow into our waterways, and it's permissible because it can't be controlled, so why not make it permissible?
[02:16:30.205 --> 02:16:34.327]  It's the same thing the Japanese and the American governments did after Fukushima.
[02:16:34.947 --> 02:16:43.976]  When the radiation went up in the Tokyo schoolyards, the response from the government was, well, we'll raise the level for exposure for children 20-fold.
[02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:45.658]  Same thing happened in the United States.
[02:16:45.678 --> 02:16:46.759]  Wave a magic wand.
[02:16:47.219 --> 02:16:48.460]  What is generating in its heart?
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.682]  I don't want to get into the technicals because you're the expert on this.
[02:16:51.203 --> 02:16:52.524]  Why are they so reckless?
[02:16:52.865 --> 02:16:58.170]  Where do these nuclear energy CEOs think their kids are going to live and their grandkids if this continues?
[02:16:59.534 --> 02:17:06.699]  Well, you know, I had a grim insight into the mindset of some of the officials that have run this program.
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.662]  I had a friend whose father worked for the Atomic Energy Commission.
[02:17:10.702 --> 02:17:11.723]  This is some time ago.
[02:17:11.763 --> 02:17:12.884]  This is one of the early guys.
[02:17:13.264 --> 02:17:17.247]  And I actually had a chance to ask him this question when I was a student at UC Berkeley.
[02:17:18.428 --> 02:17:24.773]  I asked about the danger of nuclear power and the problem of disposing of the nuclear wastes.
[02:17:25.313 --> 02:17:37.272]  And what he told me was, and he introduced his comment with kind of a laugh and a smirk, he said, what makes you think human beings are going to be here on this planet in 200 years?
[02:17:39.355 --> 02:17:39.976]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:42.483 --> 02:17:43.043]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:43.123 --> 02:17:50.847]  And you know, that's the response I've gotten, that's the response so many other scientists I've interviewed, whether it's GMO, you name it, they just say there's too many people.
[02:17:51.087 --> 02:18:00.150]  But it's not even saying too many people from their research to try to make the Earth, you know, more sustainable, even if you believe that argument.
[02:18:00.470 --> 02:18:03.772]  It's just a nihilistic, let the devil have it attitude.
[02:18:04.949 --> 02:18:21.676]  Yeah, something I concluded after looking at the response to Chernobyl and Three Mile Island in Fukushima, and more than 50 other significant reactor accidents we've had around the world in the last 50 years, is that there is a common thread.
[02:18:22.556 --> 02:18:26.798]  And I've described it as hubris, denial, and deception.
[02:18:27.278 --> 02:18:30.339]  This is the response to nuclear risk.
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:32.260]  You begin with denial.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.041]  Our technology will never fail.
[02:18:34.841 --> 02:18:35.822]  Even though you know it leaks?
[02:18:36.543 --> 02:18:42.689]  Well, there's a saying within the nuclear engineering community, and it's very brief but very telling.
[02:18:42.729 --> 02:18:44.211]  Among themselves, they agree.
[02:18:44.291 --> 02:18:45.392]  They have this statement.
[02:18:46.072 --> 02:18:47.394]  Nuclear energy can be safe.
[02:18:47.774 --> 02:18:49.476]  Nuclear energy can be clean.
[02:18:50.136 --> 02:18:51.398]  Just not at the same time.
[02:18:52.884 --> 02:18:53.844]  That's the hubris.
[02:18:54.545 --> 02:18:57.866]  Now, when the hubris fails, and there's an accident, you get into denial.
[02:18:58.807 --> 02:19:03.009]  And you saw this at all at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima.
[02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:05.430]  Initially, the government says, no problem.
[02:19:06.330 --> 02:19:13.234]  It took almost nine years before the TMI owners admitted that there'd been a partial meltdown in the plant.
[02:19:17.432 --> 02:19:21.137]  The third phase is deception.
[02:19:21.197 --> 02:19:28.347]  When it becomes obvious that there is a problem, when people downwind start picking up radiation traces and say, where is this coming from?
[02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:31.411]  Then you get into deception.
[02:19:31.532 --> 02:19:32.894]  Okay, we have it under control.
[02:19:34.326 --> 02:19:39.149]  In Japan, it's, look at the radiation monitors, which they took forever to install.
[02:19:39.570 --> 02:19:40.670]  Shows there's no problem.
[02:20:06.208 --> 02:20:11.014]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:20:11.714 --> 02:20:14.437]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:20:14.898 --> 02:20:17.201]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:20:17.681 --> 02:20:20.164]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:20:20.624 --> 02:20:23.588]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:20:24.068 --> 02:20:28.610]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:31.291]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:34.605]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:34.785 --> 02:22:39.168]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:39.348 --> 02:22:45.032]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:45.132 --> 02:22:48.554]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:48.774 --> 02:22:51.376]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:56.399]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:56.559 --> 02:22:56.780]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:58.201]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:04.244 --> 02:23:08.387]  What do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[02:23:08.807 --> 02:23:12.229]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from StockStorage.com.
[02:23:12.489 --> 02:23:19.553]  The Grover Rocket Stove starts easily with any combustible material like junk mail, small twigs, leaves, weeds or dry sagebrush.
[02:23:19.853 --> 02:23:23.915]  Then just add a small amount of kindling wood and you'll be cooking entire meals in minutes.

[02:23:46.767 --> 02:23:47.068]  That's 801-361-6984.
[02:23:53.331 --> 02:23:53.751]  We're good.
[02:24:14.574 --> 02:24:17.336]  Numbers I've seen is most of these reactors are 35 years old.
[02:24:17.356 --> 02:24:19.378]  They were supposed to only run 25 to 30 years.
[02:24:19.838 --> 02:24:21.280]  And the radiation starts eating them.
[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:22.461]  The heat eats them.
[02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:24.502]  They're just falling apart everywhere.
[02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.564]  And their answer is, store the rods there.
[02:24:26.584 --> 02:24:28.826]  Oh, you're allowed to off gas.
[02:24:28.886 --> 02:24:30.027]  Radiation's now safe.
[02:24:30.507 --> 02:24:31.988]  Just like DU in 1990.
[02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:34.150]  They'd had it since the 50s.
[02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:36.312]  Yeah, there were Army reports.
[02:24:36.352 --> 02:24:38.033]  I've had the former head of the Army program.
[02:24:39.995 --> 02:24:45.440]  Dr. Doug Rockeon, physicist, who was the head of their DU program, and they just said, we can never use this.
[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:48.162]  But magically, they said, oh, it's safe to use now.
[02:24:48.563 --> 02:24:52.826]  And there's this magic wanding where they just say, you know what?
[02:24:53.027 --> 02:24:54.628]  Isotopes are up all over the US.
[02:24:55.149 --> 02:24:57.651]  Just raise the level of isotopes of what we say is safe.
[02:24:57.671 --> 02:24:59.472]  25 times, 100 times, 200 times, some isotopes over 1,000 times.
[02:25:03.007 --> 02:25:05.729]  Radiation didn't go that high, but why not raise it a billion times?
[02:25:05.789 --> 02:25:09.431]  Why not say you could live in the center of the sun and wave a magic wand?
[02:25:09.791 --> 02:25:19.337]  So, so, recapping the three stages with author and researcher Gar Smith, best-selling author of Nuclear Roulette, available at infowarestore.com.
[02:25:19.357 --> 02:25:23.199]  Hope you get it and read it, because even if you know about it, there's a lot to learn here, and then give it to others.
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.561]  Gar, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:25.881 --> 02:25:27.302]  Recap the first two levels.
[02:25:27.322 --> 02:25:27.702]  You've got
[02:25:29.943 --> 02:25:33.405]  The first two levels, then you were getting into deception, and then go back into deception.
[02:25:33.445 --> 02:25:37.346]  How they handle it now, when, you know, a few months ago, oh, there's radiation up all over Europe.
[02:25:37.386 --> 02:25:37.946]  Very dangerous.
[02:25:38.427 --> 02:25:41.008]  Oh, yeah, France had a leak, but we're not going to say anything about it.
[02:25:41.048 --> 02:25:41.608]  Please continue.
[02:25:43.018 --> 02:25:49.682]  Yeah, the government has not been a very reliable source of information, and this is a general trend too.
[02:25:50.062 --> 02:25:53.323]  One of my favorite quotes is from Dr. Natalia Marinova.
[02:25:53.423 --> 02:25:58.246]  She's a nuclear engineer from Russia, and she's one of the survivors of the Chernobyl cleanup crew.
[02:25:59.006 --> 02:26:04.289]  And her advice to Americans when she visited San Francisco a couple of years ago was,
[02:26:06.866 --> 02:26:08.687]  This is a quote.
[02:26:09.087 --> 02:26:10.967]  Run as fast as you can.
[02:26:11.707 --> 02:26:13.028]  Don't believe the government.
[02:26:13.708 --> 02:26:15.189]  The government will lie to you.
[02:26:16.069 --> 02:26:20.010]  And you have to believe her because she wears the Chernobyl necklace.
[02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:25.672]  Those are the scars left behind from two surgeries to remove thyroid tumors.
[02:26:27.732 --> 02:26:36.115]  Over in Japan now, the government wants people to feel relieved that the radiation monitors are showing lower levels of radiation.
[02:26:37.318 --> 02:26:47.009]  Somebody pointed out that the new systems that they've installed register radiation levels at 40% less than the previous monitors did.
[02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:54.979]  But they admit that they, this all came out, they admitted they lied about the levels and they had kids dropping dead from heart failure from the radiation.
[02:26:54.999 --> 02:26:55.960]  They just covered it up.
[02:26:57.121 --> 02:26:57.322]  Yeah.
[02:26:59.873 --> 02:27:02.195]  It's part of the scenario.
[02:27:02.215 --> 02:27:04.977]  You get it in all of these situations in all of these countries.
[02:27:06.038 --> 02:27:12.063]  One of the problems that I have identified, I'm calling the regulatory industrial complex.
[02:27:12.763 --> 02:27:22.111]  You have these organizations that we are told are supposed to be providing oversight and protection for the public, but instead they're acting too often as enablers.
[02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:30.314]  You have individuals with the NRC who, as inspectors in these plants, are finding some real problems and reporting them.
[02:27:30.854 --> 02:27:41.737]  But at the top level, you find the NRC is going out of its way to facilitate the operation of reactors that should have been closed down.
[02:27:42.277 --> 02:27:43.738]  And the Associated Press
[02:27:44.298 --> 02:27:49.262]  They deserve the biggest reporting award in the world for a survey that they did.
[02:27:49.342 --> 02:27:59.030]  They took a look at 11,000 NRC documents to see what the situation looked like from inside a nuclear reactor.
[02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:04.234]  Now, ordinarily you don't get to see the photographs that the NRC put in these reports.
[02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:07.037]  Rusted pipes, leaking water.
[02:28:07.717 --> 02:28:21.063]  This does not look like a sensible modern industrial plant, but the innards of these, some places you can't even get inside the reactor components to see how they're performing.
[02:28:21.083 --> 02:28:23.303]  They're just so difficult to reach.
[02:28:24.024 --> 02:28:26.785]  But this is a summary that the AP came up with.
[02:28:27.901 --> 02:28:35.370]  Federal regulators have been working closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation's 18 reactors operating within safety standards.
[02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:35.731]  How?
[02:28:36.111 --> 02:28:40.717]  By repeatedly weakening those standards or simply failing to enforce them.
[02:28:41.198 --> 02:28:42.099]  A little more detail.
[02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:42.419]  Quote.
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:49.369]  When valves leaked, more leakage was allowed, up to 20 times the original limit.
[02:28:49.749 --> 02:28:58.601]  When rampant cracking caused radioactive leaks from steam generator tubing, an easier test was devised so that the plants could meet the standards.
[02:28:58.621 --> 02:28:59.522]  It goes on and on.
[02:29:03.263 --> 02:29:18.727]  It's so frustrating, too, because I have three children, and I know, as Dr. Bob Bowman, who's a nuclear physicist, a former head of the Star Wars program, has said here, when things like Chernobyl or things like Fukushima happen, it just increases the cancer rate for the general public at large.
[02:29:18.767 --> 02:29:24.669]  But if you get a hot particle that was carried on dust or whatever, then you just get the lung cancer when you're 20.
[02:29:24.969 --> 02:29:29.430]  You know, people that get it today who are five years old, and they just say, oh, you got lung cancer.
[02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:33.232]  And so you get, it's like Russian roulette, as you call it.
[02:29:33.552 --> 02:29:36.133]  Nuclear roulette with these hot particles.
[02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:40.036]  And the thing is, the nuclear industry is getting worse and worse.
[02:29:40.076 --> 02:29:45.999]  And then we have all these cases, as you know, in Southern California and other places, where they've had total meltdowns before, like the salt reactor.
[02:29:46.459 --> 02:29:49.301]  And then no one even knows about that today, even though it's declassified.
[02:29:49.541 --> 02:29:51.282]  They keep it secret when they meltdown.
[02:29:51.542 --> 02:29:52.922]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:29:54.023 --> 02:29:54.924]  We're on the march.
[02:29:55.424 --> 02:29:56.925]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.951 --> 02:30:00.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.671 --> 02:30:07.753]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[02:30:08.133 --> 02:30:13.856]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.

[02:32:06.012 --> 02:32:10.895]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:32:11.595 --> 02:32:14.397]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:32:14.837 --> 02:32:17.218]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:32:17.659 --> 02:32:20.200]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:23.682]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:32:24.182 --> 02:32:28.806]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:32:29.387 --> 02:32:31.509]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[02:32:51.162 --> 02:32:53.603]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:32:53.623 --> 02:32:55.183]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:33:17.915 --> 02:33:21.337]  Here's Dave Mustaine with Countdown to Extinction.
[02:33:21.757 --> 02:33:34.343]  A song about when you've got the last animal alive of a species, there are people that will pay millions of dollars, crank it up, to walk up and shoot it right there in the cage.
[02:33:36.864 --> 02:33:46.249]  And what we have is our own species, the technocrats.
[02:33:47.808 --> 02:33:53.972]  They are treating us like animals as well, and they have a nihilistic attitude.
[02:33:54.132 --> 02:33:56.334]  Ah, so what if this GMO sterilizes people?
[02:33:56.354 --> 02:33:57.094]  There are too many people.
[02:33:57.695 --> 02:33:59.096]  Ah, so what if these reactors blow up?
[02:33:59.136 --> 02:34:00.797]  You don't think we'd always be here, do you?
[02:34:01.497 --> 02:34:10.984]  And it's just also rich guys can live in bigger $100 million mansions that have more billions than the next guy showing off at cocktail parties.
[02:34:11.064 --> 02:34:17.608]  It literally gets down to that from some of the top stockbrokers and millionaires that I've talked to on record and off record.
[02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:23.193]  And again, I'm all for making money with an invention or a device and I'm all for low taxes.
[02:34:23.914 --> 02:34:25.476]  It's the crony capitalist.
[02:34:26.889 --> 02:34:42.961]  The monopoly capitalists who are so nihilistic, and the thing is they sell their whole Agenda 21 takeover in the name of saving the earth, while all they do is say they want to tax carbon dioxide, or in San Diego arrest you if there's runoff from washing your car.
[02:34:44.162 --> 02:34:47.825]  Again, it's a tyranny, and the corporations are all exempt.
[02:34:48.665 --> 02:34:54.009]  And meanwhile, I've looked at it, I've talked to the experts, I've deeply investigated this,
[02:34:56.488 --> 02:35:03.453]  We knew day one they weren't showing for three or four months any of the numbers out of the Fukushima area and out of that province.
[02:35:05.370 --> 02:35:10.795]  That's why it showed three times the radiation in Tokyo, a couple provinces, you know, south of there, than they had there.
[02:35:10.835 --> 02:35:11.756]  And then now it came out.
[02:35:12.056 --> 02:35:13.978]  The head of Tokyo Electric apologized.
[02:35:14.058 --> 02:35:14.599]  Leaders apologized.
[02:35:14.839 --> 02:35:16.040]  Yeah, we covered up the numbers.
[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:17.121]  Yeah, we didn't want to panic.
[02:35:17.902 --> 02:35:24.188]  Meanwhile, it turned out three months after Fukushima, tuna hit the West Coast and the government tested the tuna.
[02:35:24.788 --> 02:35:28.092]  They knew it had very dangerous isotopes in it at high levels.
[02:35:29.045 --> 02:35:31.126]  And they said, you know what, we'll just raise the level, it's safe.
[02:35:31.466 --> 02:35:32.247]  Let them eat the tuna.
[02:35:32.967 --> 02:35:37.530]  And again, as corrupt as our government's been in the past, they didn't used to act like this from my research.
[02:35:38.390 --> 02:35:40.031]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:35:40.412 --> 02:35:42.813]  You've got things much bigger than Three Mile Island happening.
[02:35:42.833 --> 02:35:43.814]  What was it, in 59?
[02:35:44.154 --> 02:35:46.515]  They had a salt reactor blow up in Southern California.
[02:35:47.276 --> 02:35:48.836]  Radiated people, huge event.
[02:35:49.157 --> 02:35:50.037]  That wasn't known until the 90s.
[02:35:50.137 --> 02:35:52.278]  In fact, I'll pull up that article and show people.
[02:35:52.599 --> 02:35:55.000]  I'm ranting here, but Gar Smith is our guest.
[02:35:55.020 --> 02:35:55.921]  You were getting into
[02:35:56.821 --> 02:36:00.184]  We want to break the deception, the cover-ups, and where they're going.
[02:36:00.465 --> 02:36:12.737]  Am I wrong from my research, and kind of a snapshot compared to your research, in saying they're getting more reckless by the day, or is that just that I'm becoming more informed and they've always been reckless?
[02:36:15.924 --> 02:36:19.467]  I think recklessness is built into the technology.
[02:36:20.788 --> 02:36:31.015]  There's no way on God's green earth that an engineering plan that would create a nuclear reactor could be considered logically sustainable.
[02:36:32.475 --> 02:36:42.880]  I was talking with Marv Fertel, who's a nuclear industry representative, and he made the statement that nuclear energy was essential because we needed electricity.
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:53.364]  And I pointed out to him at a public meeting, and he nodded his head in agreement when I insisted that nuclear energy does not produce electricity.
[02:36:54.024 --> 02:36:55.385]  It produces only two things.
[02:36:55.765 --> 02:36:59.967]  The first is a lot of heat, and the second is a lot of radioactive garbage.
[02:37:01.254 --> 02:37:02.836]  There are a lot of things that produce heat.
[02:37:03.337 --> 02:37:05.079]  There are a lot of ways to generate steam.
[02:37:05.901 --> 02:37:09.486]  And it's the steam that generates the electricity through the turbine spinning.
[02:37:10.027 --> 02:37:16.296]  So we could have geothermal, wind, coal, natural gas, hydroelectric, the list goes on and on.
[02:37:17.128 --> 02:37:19.509]  Yeah, and there is one irony.
[02:37:19.909 --> 02:37:25.791]  Among all of our energy sector players, there's only one industry that believes in global warming.
[02:37:26.372 --> 02:37:28.812]  It's not coal, it's not nuclear, it's not gas.
[02:37:29.333 --> 02:37:33.934]  I'm sorry, it is the nuclear industry, because they argue.
[02:37:36.397 --> 02:37:40.883]  Global warming can be solved with nuclear energy, because we don't produce CO2 gases.
[02:37:50.086 --> 02:38:01.397]  The carbon dioxide is produced when you build the plant, when you extract the ore, when you refine the product, when you create the fuel assemblies, when you do all of the shipping and then eventually the dismantling.
[02:38:01.777 --> 02:38:08.764]  The only time it doesn't produce CO2 is when it's busy producing huge amounts of unused heat.
[02:38:09.685 --> 02:38:12.687]  And radioactive isotopes that are puffing away from the plants.
[02:38:12.727 --> 02:38:17.310]  But listen, you're totally right on record that the plants are rotting, falling apart.
[02:38:17.350 --> 02:38:18.651]  The Associated Press admits that.
[02:38:19.071 --> 02:38:24.694]  My issue here is, I understand people think carbon dioxide goes up, it can make the sea levels rise.
[02:38:24.935 --> 02:38:29.417]  Let's just, for the sake of argument, say that's real, which I disagree with, from the scientists we've interviewed.
[02:38:29.978 --> 02:38:33.840]  Still, reactors rotting and melting down everywhere is a lot bigger deal.
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.602]  Why don't environmentalists get upset about nuclear power?
[02:38:37.202 --> 02:38:43.547]  Instead of embracing it, because the big global warming advocates, George Monbiot, you know the list, they are just saying, I love it!
[02:38:43.587 --> 02:38:47.610]  In fact, his quote was, I believe in nuclear power more after Fukushima.
[02:38:47.950 --> 02:38:50.031]  I mean, what type of asinine statement is that?
[02:38:50.051 --> 02:38:56.176]  That's like Ann Coulter saying, radiation's good for you, the Japanese should thank the nuclear industry.
[02:38:58.109 --> 02:39:15.073]  Yeah, well, we do have the unholy triad of George and Stuart Brand and Lovelace, who are supporting nuclear power, but that doesn't mean the majority of environmentalists have the same line.
[02:39:15.093 --> 02:39:23.335]  These are guys who have prominent celebrity positions, which are not reflective of the... So they're selling out.
[02:39:23.555 --> 02:39:26.396]  Okay, is nuclear the most dangerous thing, in your opinion, to the environment?
[02:39:28.332 --> 02:39:34.535]  Uh, yeah, the most dangerous man-made technology that I think we've ever developed.
[02:39:36.216 --> 02:39:44.700]  Okay, well, so if it's getting worse, I mean, where do you predict it's going to go now that they're going to even build more old design reactors and then keep the old ones going?
[02:39:45.748 --> 02:39:54.310]  Well, they want to keep the old ones going because it's a way of continuing to make money instead of facing up to the fact that eventually they're supposed to tear these things down.
[02:39:55.790 --> 02:40:02.432]  They do want to build new design reactors in the U.S., down in Georgia and South Carolina.
[02:40:02.472 --> 02:40:08.033]  They want to build these AP1000s and they're getting huge billion-dollar government loan guarantees to do it.
[02:40:08.653 --> 02:40:16.715]  But the construction isn't going too well and the prospects are not too bright that they'll ever be finished or safely operated.
[02:40:17.315 --> 02:40:28.558]  And the basic design of these things was so problematic that not even the NRC could get a unanimous vote out of five to have a unanimous approval of the design.
[02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:30.419]  The former chair of the
[02:40:30.959 --> 02:40:40.211]  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission refused to vote for these new AP1000 reactors because he said the engineering plan had not taken in the lessons of Fukushima.
[02:40:40.832 --> 02:40:46.399]  And getting back to Fukushima, we should bear in mind that those reactors that exploded in Japan were not Japanese reactors.
[02:40:46.419 --> 02:40:46.920]  They were US.
[02:40:48.882 --> 02:40:50.203]  Made by General Electric.
[02:40:50.904 --> 02:41:11.096]  And the basic lesson there is when you have three reactors, side by side, that explode sequentially, one after another, one, two, three, and the fourth, which got damaged, what that tells you is that that design, it's not designed just to produce a lot of heat, it was inadvertently designed, as we now see, to explode.
[02:41:12.117 --> 02:41:14.839]  We have 23 Fukushima-style reactors,
[02:41:15.908 --> 02:41:19.569]  in the United States at 16 sites in 12 states.
[02:41:20.669 --> 02:41:23.990]  The NRC has put out a list of 27 U.S.
[02:41:24.050 --> 02:41:32.072]  reactors that are most at risk of a calamity in the event of a major local earthquake.
[02:41:33.332 --> 02:41:36.853]  On that list of 27, five are Fukushima-style reactors.
[02:41:38.726 --> 02:41:55.914]  There should be some concern, not only about the threat from earthquakes, which we now know are much higher in the Midwest and the Southeast, where most of the historic large quakes have hit and where most of our reactors are located.
[02:41:58.544 --> 02:42:07.516]  Also, we should be paying attention to the warnings from NASA and the National Academy of Sciences that we are entering a maximum solar year.
[02:42:08.377 --> 02:42:09.458]  It's already begun.
[02:42:09.518 --> 02:42:15.265]  We are getting hit with solar flares that are going to increase in frequency and in
[02:42:17.387 --> 02:42:36.753]  And I want to expand on that briefly because that's what a lot of scientists have been on say is the biggest threat because you can blow out the power systems and you have more meltdowns which has been proven but you know before with pre-nuclear events to the power system in Russia and other areas but what about all the insane ideas of now going to nuclear powered spacecraft
[02:42:37.333 --> 02:42:38.715]  And they're saying, oh, it's totally safe.
[02:42:38.736 --> 02:42:51.677]  We want to start launching a rocket every month in nuclear-powered satellites when all the research I've seen says that when those rockets fail, which they do around 10% of the time, it could end up blowing up in the atmosphere and then you've got a big problem.
[02:42:52.619 --> 02:42:53.580]  It's already happened.
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.881]  It's happened a couple of times.
[02:42:55.681 --> 02:43:00.986]  We had a Russian reactor that burned out of orbit and slammed into the Andes.
[02:43:01.326 --> 02:43:03.087]  We have a U.S.
[02:43:03.988 --> 02:43:07.951]  system that crashed into the ocean with a nuclear power plant.
[02:43:08.051 --> 02:43:10.133]  We've orbited
[02:43:11.334 --> 02:43:14.895]  plutonium-powered spacecraft into deep space.
[02:43:15.056 --> 02:43:22.058]  But in order to reach deep space, somebody came up with the idea of using the Earth's gravitational pull as kind of like a bolo.
[02:43:22.419 --> 02:43:23.039]  A slingshot.
[02:43:23.939 --> 02:43:25.140]  A slingshot, exactly.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:39.446]  And that meant that we fired this system with this plutonium core reactor out into space, intending that it come back toward the Earth and that it clip the Earth's orbit and then circle the planet and zip back out even further into space.
[02:43:39.466 --> 02:43:40.066]  That's a great idea.
[02:43:40.726 --> 02:43:41.507]  But look at the risk.
[02:43:41.907 --> 02:43:42.887]  What if that had missed?
[02:43:43.228 --> 02:43:47.930]  What if there had been some kind of a terrible error that would have slammed into the planet?
[02:43:50.152 --> 02:43:51.593]  Well, look at all the space disasters.
[02:43:51.633 --> 02:43:52.893]  It's one of the most dangerous things.
[02:43:54.354 --> 02:43:56.816]  It has a huge margin of disaster.
[02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:09.663]  Yeah, when you're dealing with imponderables and the likelihood of error, you really shouldn't be dealing on a level of nuclear potential.
[02:44:09.843 --> 02:44:12.924]  Gar, why is it the mad scientists that get in charge?
[02:44:12.944 --> 02:44:15.065]  I guess they'll tell the government bureaucrats what they want.
[02:44:15.105 --> 02:44:24.427]  I'm sure you've seen, I talk a lot about it, New Trinity, Trinity and Beyond, like ten years ago or longer, narrated by William Shatner, and in that,
[02:44:28.809 --> 02:44:38.703]  It shows what I'd read about, but it's the film footage of them detonating hundreds of high-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere to, quote, see if they could damage the atmosphere.
[02:44:39.323 --> 02:44:41.106]  I mean, who are these people?
[02:44:41.206 --> 02:44:42.247]  Why are they doing this?
[02:44:45.047 --> 02:44:50.468]  I sometimes think of this as teenage science, you know, teenage boy science.
[02:44:52.308 --> 02:44:52.949]  Why do you do it?
[02:44:53.149 --> 02:44:54.589]  Just to see if we can do it.
[02:44:54.729 --> 02:45:00.970]  You know, let's put this firecracker in this can or inside this watermelon and light it off and see what happens.
[02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:03.170]  Or inside this frog if you're George W. Bush.
[02:45:03.791 --> 02:45:05.431]  Oh yeah, he's done that.
[02:45:06.071 --> 02:45:11.332]  And I mean, these are the guys that came up with the idea to explode a nuclear bomb on the moon.
[02:45:13.012 --> 02:45:13.492]  Exactly.
[02:45:15.094 --> 02:45:20.857]  Or they wanted to do cross-cast to go drill down to the edge of the mantle and detonate one, but that got nixed.
[02:45:20.978 --> 02:45:21.998]  At least we're told it did.
[02:45:22.339 --> 02:45:23.379]  These are crazy people.
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:27.002]  Yeah, and these are just the stunts that we know about.
[02:45:27.162 --> 02:45:29.083]  God knows what they've been doing in the last month.
[02:45:31.365 --> 02:45:33.086]  Oh man, and with HAARP and all the rest of it.
[02:45:36.121 --> 02:45:37.261]  We're almost out of time here.
[02:45:37.281 --> 02:45:40.022]  The book's available at InfoWareStore.com and Better Bookstores everywhere.
[02:45:40.042 --> 02:45:40.682]  It's a best-seller.
[02:45:41.082 --> 02:45:42.203]  Nuclear Roulette.
[02:45:42.243 --> 02:45:43.043]  I've read the book.
[02:45:43.463 --> 02:45:49.904]  I learned a lot from it, and believe me, I've probably done, let's not exaggerate, 100 interviews with top experts over the years on this subject and read a lot of books.
[02:45:50.365 --> 02:45:53.145]  I learned a lot, and I just see this as one of the biggest threats to my family.
[02:45:53.525 --> 02:45:59.867]  I think in closing, I interrupted your train of thought with the space-based stuff, finishing up with the solar flare EMP danger.
[02:46:01.257 --> 02:46:02.998]  Well, yeah, this is something we know about.
[02:46:03.018 --> 02:46:03.698]  We've been warned.
[02:46:04.338 --> 02:46:10.841]  It could knock us out for four to ten years, according to NASA, according to the National Academy of Sciences.
[02:46:11.181 --> 02:46:12.201]  We know what we can do.
[02:46:13.141 --> 02:46:17.463]  We need to protect the ultra-high voltage transformers in the United States.
[02:46:17.523 --> 02:46:18.744]  There's 350 of them.
[02:46:19.144 --> 02:46:20.464]  We can put in ground resistors.
[02:46:20.484 --> 02:46:22.025]  For only $2 billion?
[02:46:23.058 --> 02:46:23.238]  Right.
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:26.501]  For the Pentagon, that's chump change.
[02:46:26.822 --> 02:46:27.362]  We could do that.
[02:46:27.402 --> 02:46:29.605]  There was a bill in the Senate called the SHIELD Act.
[02:46:29.625 --> 02:46:30.586]  We've got to act on that.
[02:46:30.766 --> 02:46:31.326]  Bring it back.
[02:46:32.988 --> 02:46:33.929]  The problem's not going away.
[02:46:33.969 --> 02:46:35.210]  It's only going to get worse.
[02:46:35.270 --> 02:46:36.291]  It's only going to come sooner.
[02:46:36.351 --> 02:46:37.252]  So we've got to act now.
[02:46:37.312 --> 02:46:38.974]  That's something that we need to do.
[02:46:39.014 --> 02:46:46.822]  We know earthquakes are going to pose a problem, but we definitely know that those solar flares are really something that we have to wake up to and deal with.
[02:46:47.625 --> 02:47:12.888]  For folks who don't know, it's happened a bunch in the U.S., but also in Europe, since they put up telegraph wires and things, and they think it's roughly a hundred year cycle, there's sub-cycles, but a hundred years ago, all over the world, different times, generally, we've pulled up the dates on air before, you can look it up, when these solar flares hit right, and all that ionizing different particles come in, it literally can melt wires across continents, and if that happens today, folks, we are in deep trouble.
[02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:15.691]  Yeah, we got hit with a solar flare in 89.
[02:47:15.832 --> 02:47:24.459]  It knocked out the power to 6 million Canadians and it also melted a transformer at the Salem 1 reactor in the U.S.
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:26.421]  And that was a small one.
[02:47:26.841 --> 02:47:33.887]  I've had a different astrophysicist on saying that routinely stuff 20-30 times bigger hits.
[02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:37.311]  Can you imagine what happens if a really big one hits?
[02:47:37.331 --> 02:47:38.892]  When they say it, it could just be unbelievable.
[02:47:40.113 --> 02:47:40.954]  I hate to think about it.
[02:47:42.253 --> 02:47:45.215]  What are the estimates on exactly, from your research, how bad it could be?
[02:47:46.035 --> 02:47:49.177]  What's the highest rate on one of those flares that we could survive?
[02:47:49.217 --> 02:47:50.017]  I forget the name of it.
[02:47:50.077 --> 02:47:50.778]  Is it called an M1?
[02:47:50.838 --> 02:47:51.578]  What are they called?
[02:47:52.519 --> 02:47:57.481]  Yeah, I think there's a five-tier level for flares.
[02:47:57.941 --> 02:47:58.862]  I'm not exactly sure.
[02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:04.125]  Sure, but just from memory, I mean, the level we're talking about, some estimates are it could knock out every reactor in North America.
[02:48:06.092 --> 02:48:06.533]  Well, yeah.
[02:48:06.913 --> 02:48:23.041]  Implicitly, if you lose the power, and if you don't have backup, if your diesel generators don't have enough juice to keep running until the power is restored, and if you're talking about power restoration that's going to be foreclosed for a period of months to years, all of those reactors are going to fail.
[02:48:23.121 --> 02:48:23.881]  They're going to melt down.
[02:48:23.901 --> 02:48:24.662]  They're going to run away.
[02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:43.765]  And believe me, as big a problem as decommissioning these reactors is now, the estimate is it's going to cost half a billion to a billion dollars to close down every reactor and ten years to decommission and isolate the wastes.
[02:48:44.815 --> 02:48:52.857]  In the case of Fukushima, they are estimating that it's going to take $137 billion and 30 years to deal with that problem.
[02:48:53.637 --> 02:48:55.158]  And it still won't be completely mitigated.
[02:48:55.218 --> 02:48:58.818]  In closing, you know, my big issue here is, look at Sandy.
[02:48:58.878 --> 02:49:06.200]  We're three weeks into this, large areas still don't have power, and that is microscopic compared to a big solar flare.
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:10.241]  I mean, imagine, and then the diesel runs out, what, two, three weeks?
[02:49:10.521 --> 02:49:11.642]  And then the reactors meltdown.
[02:49:15.390 --> 02:49:19.115]  And then you got the spent fuel in these GE reactors on the rooftops.
[02:49:20.356 --> 02:49:21.257]  You were building a home.
[02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:23.100]  Is that where you'd put your garbage can?
[02:49:24.361 --> 02:49:27.906]  Well, plus, what, that MOX reactor even had plutonium in it that blew up.
[02:49:28.834 --> 02:49:31.476]  Yeah, yeah, the third reactor.
[02:49:32.117 --> 02:49:37.180]  They were using a mix of military-grade uranium byproduct.
[02:49:37.941 --> 02:49:50.911]  This is, I mean, it's returning the favor, because initially reactors, the government gave the power plant operators uranium, and in exchange they got plutonium that they turned into buttons for nuclear triggers.
[02:49:51.631 --> 02:49:53.213]  And now, thanks to
[02:49:55.114 --> 02:49:59.817]  Happily, you know, the dismantling of some of the nuclear throw weight in the Russian missiles.
[02:49:59.857 --> 02:50:05.080]  We're burning Russian uranium product in our nuclear power plants.
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:08.202]  That's the MOX, the mixed uranium oxide.
[02:50:08.262 --> 02:50:12.045]  And as that nuclear expert said from Russia, run as fast as you can.
[02:50:12.065 --> 02:50:13.185]  Amazing.
[02:50:13.285 --> 02:50:15.587]  Ladies and gentlemen, we can shut this down if we try.
[02:50:16.207 --> 02:50:19.590]  And the environmentalists are just going to have to sit there and be scared of the carbon dioxide plants.
[02:50:19.970 --> 02:50:24.393]  Again, even if you think coal's deadly, folks, I'd say coal over nuclear any day.
[02:50:24.453 --> 02:50:28.216]  Nuclear roulette, the truth about the most dangerous energy source on earth.
[02:50:28.936 --> 02:50:38.023]  Gar Smith, shut down the plants now and start prosecuting the people that have cut back the safety standards because they are endangering us all.
[02:50:38.043 --> 02:50:38.824]  Gar, thank you for the time.
[02:50:39.858 --> 02:50:40.198]  Thank you.
[02:50:40.858 --> 02:50:41.338]  All right, folks.
[02:50:41.358 --> 02:50:41.879]  Get the book.
[02:50:42.319 --> 02:50:42.619]  All right.
[02:50:42.839 --> 02:50:46.800]  A few final news stories on the side and a few final calls as well.
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:50.681]  David in Connecticut says he's got employers and vaccines all over the country.
[02:50:51.242 --> 02:50:54.162]  Even people that work at tire factories, they're trying to make them take the shots.
[02:50:54.583 --> 02:50:58.644]  That's the covert corporate fascism trying to make us take all their deadly vaccines.
[02:50:59.144 --> 02:50:59.904]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:00.004 --> 02:51:01.885]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:05.305 --> 02:51:11.548]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:14.309]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:51:14.329 --> 02:51:14.710]  The U.S.
[02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:18.892]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:51:19.012 --> 02:51:21.593]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:51:21.973 --> 02:51:23.234]  They want that attack to come.
[02:51:23.474 --> 02:51:29.657]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:51:30.037 --> 02:51:32.499]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:51:32.699 --> 02:51:37.502]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:51:37.662 --> 02:51:45.107]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:51:45.427 --> 02:51:47.968]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:51:48.168 --> 02:51:50.789]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:52:53.654 --> 02:52:54.655]  The 60 Second Pain Relief.
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:10.522]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:53:11.122 --> 02:53:12.222]  That's closer than you think.
[02:53:12.943 --> 02:53:18.765]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[02:53:19.125 --> 02:53:27.068]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[02:53:27.868 --> 02:53:33.410]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:35.151]  But here's some good news.
[02:53:35.531 --> 02:53:44.377]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:53:45.018 --> 02:53:53.824]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:53:54.285 --> 02:53:58.328]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:53:58.488 --> 02:53:59.989]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[02:54:06.402 --> 02:54:15.408]  The Babylon system is the vampire, sucking the children day by day.
[02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:32.624]  And the vampires love taking the toxic waste of fertilizer mines and aluminum and dumping it in your water.
[02:54:32.664 --> 02:54:34.745]  Not just sodium fluoride, but hundreds of chemicals.
[02:54:35.285 --> 02:54:39.166]  That's why we sell and promote and I use the ProPure water filtration system.
[02:54:39.527 --> 02:54:41.487]  I brought the sale back until December 10th.
[02:54:41.507 --> 02:54:42.368]  You'll hear ads running.
[02:54:43.288 --> 02:54:43.909]  15% off.
[02:54:44.029 --> 02:54:45.029]  We got them in stock.
[02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:46.870]  We already had the lowest price before that.
[02:54:46.890 --> 02:54:47.190]  15% off is 15% off.
[02:54:49.671 --> 02:54:57.319]  Above and beyond the best deal on the ProPure Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Water Filters that start at $189 with 15% off.
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:54:58.721]  I don't know, what is that?
[02:54:58.741 --> 02:55:00.623]  $150 or something or less?
[02:55:00.643 --> 02:55:04.427]  The point is, they're all available right now and they're great to give as gifts.
[02:55:06.249 --> 02:55:09.632]  Oh, it's 185, excuse me, with 15% off, so it goes down even lower.
[02:55:09.652 --> 02:55:11.673]  I don't know, what is 15% off 185?
[02:55:12.574 --> 02:55:15.877]  And it doesn't have plastic spigots, it's got stainless steel spigots as well.
[02:55:15.897 --> 02:55:17.198]  It's got the fluoride filters.
[02:55:17.759 --> 02:55:20.421]  All the water filtration products have got discounts.
[02:55:20.821 --> 02:55:23.023]  Promo code WATER15WATER15.
[02:55:23.123 --> 02:55:25.665]  Infowarstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:30.280]  It's $157.
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:31.561]  There you go.
[02:55:31.581 --> 02:55:33.063]  That's how much it's off from $185.
[02:55:35.705 --> 02:55:36.686]  $28 off on the basic unit.
[02:55:37.246 --> 02:55:38.427]  Let's talk to Dave.
[02:55:38.447 --> 02:55:41.970]  Talking about employers and vaccines.
[02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:43.271]  I should have talked about this more.
[02:55:43.311 --> 02:55:53.319]  Now all over the country, engine manufacturers, tire manufacturers, soda pop factories.
[02:55:53.599 --> 02:55:57.523]  You will take flu shots in this whole list of other shots or you will be fired.
[02:55:58.203 --> 02:55:59.584]  And it's totally criminal.
[02:55:59.965 --> 02:56:04.428]  A, it's deadly, doesn't protect you, lowers your immunity, and it's just so evil.
[02:56:04.828 --> 02:56:11.554]  It's one step closer to Chinese factories where they do that and have forced abortions to work at the Apple factories that's come out.
[02:56:11.654 --> 02:56:13.195]  I mean, it's just pure evil.
[02:56:13.735 --> 02:56:16.838]  And they're also, courts are really going to give kids shots without parental consent.
[02:56:16.878 --> 02:56:17.779]  That's in the news today.
[02:56:18.279 --> 02:56:20.240]  Dave in Connecticut, what's your take on this?
[02:56:20.421 --> 02:56:23.283]  I see that's in the line there that says employers and vaccines.
[02:56:23.323 --> 02:56:24.344]  Real quick, what's going on with you?
[02:56:25.473 --> 02:56:27.755]  Alex, we have a Patriot emergency up here.
[02:56:27.775 --> 02:56:29.096]  That's the only way I can put it.
[02:56:29.136 --> 02:56:30.157]  I've been a listener since 98.
[02:56:31.518 --> 02:56:44.150]  And the local hospital, Waterbury Hospital, has informed their employees that if they don't get a flu shot by tomorrow, Friday afternoon, November 30th, at 5 p.m., they will be subject to a two-week suspension.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:45.731]  You've got to sue them.
[02:56:45.751 --> 02:56:47.713]  You've got to sue them for religious rights.
[02:56:48.213 --> 02:56:51.416]  You've got to sue them for medical tyranny.
[02:56:52.217 --> 02:56:55.200]  And bring in the eugenics hearings of the 2030s and 40s.
[02:56:55.740 --> 02:57:00.144]  And then you can present in the court case to the jury all the evidence of it.
[02:57:00.905 --> 02:57:03.488]  Here's what we're asking for right now, Alex, and we may very well do that.
[02:57:03.508 --> 02:57:06.692]  The union is looking into it at the hospital, one of the unions.
[02:57:22.748 --> 02:57:29.591]  We're asking that your listeners, if they help us, just to call the Waterbury Hospital switchboard.
[02:57:29.631 --> 02:57:30.772]  Sure, they've already tried this.
[02:57:30.812 --> 02:57:33.513]  They've already tried this, by the way, five times the last ten years.
[02:57:34.053 --> 02:57:34.633]  They're back.
[02:57:34.713 --> 02:57:35.934]  You will defeat them.
[02:57:36.214 --> 02:57:37.855]  You must sue them with an injunction.
[02:57:37.875 --> 02:57:39.416]  You bring in the medical stuff.
[02:57:39.436 --> 02:57:40.936]  You get a lawyer that knows what they're doing.
[02:57:41.156 --> 02:57:42.197]  You will beat these people.
[02:57:42.657 --> 02:57:45.660]  Okay, because they're doing this everywhere now, not just the hospital.
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:47.761]  Next they want to make the cops and firefighters take it.
[02:57:48.062 --> 02:57:50.123]  So look out cops, they tried this in 02.
[02:57:50.444 --> 02:57:51.825]  They're going to make you do this too.
[02:57:52.185 --> 02:57:57.950]  Anyone who goes to a hospital, whoever works there, tearing out trash, food service, you name it.
[02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:59.251]  Yes, I was aware of that.
[02:57:59.311 --> 02:58:01.813]  It's happening nationwide, but I was aware of the town you're in.
[02:58:01.833 --> 02:58:02.394]  Give us the number.
[02:58:02.414 --> 02:58:03.374]  203-573-6000.
[02:58:03.394 --> 02:58:03.855]  That's 203-573-6000.
[02:58:09.475 --> 02:58:09.935]  I think?
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:28.161]  ...of forced vaccination of their employees.
[02:58:28.661 --> 02:58:34.764]  Just leave the phone message at the main switchboard for... By the way, by the way, that is the number to Waterbury Hospital.
[02:58:34.784 --> 02:58:38.026]  We don't really let people just give numbers out, but I can tell by your tone that you're for real.
[02:58:38.066 --> 02:58:40.487]  We checked it, and I was already aware of Waterbury doing that.
[02:58:40.847 --> 02:58:42.107]  All right, very, very interesting.
[02:58:42.127 --> 02:58:43.528]  Yeah, people, we better fight this now.
[02:58:43.548 --> 02:58:49.991]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:50.011 --> 02:58:51.912]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:55.134 --> 02:59:00.597]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[02:59:00.898 --> 02:59:07.982]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[02:59:08.282 --> 02:59:10.724]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[02:59:11.004 --> 02:59:17.068]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[02:59:17.708 --> 02:59:20.489]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[02:59:20.769 --> 02:59:27.413]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[02:59:27.633 --> 02:59:32.695]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.

[02:59:59.201 --> 03:00:03.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.106 --> 03:00:06.847]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.808 --> 03:00:09.089]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:10.149 --> 03:00:11.270]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.931 --> 03:00:13.352]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:14.012 --> 03:00:15.333]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:16.154 --> 03:00:20.838]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.323 --> 03:00:34.188]  All right, taking a few final calls in the customary after radio broadcast transmission.
[03:00:34.228 --> 03:00:35.949]  We're into the fourth hour right now.
[03:00:36.410 --> 03:00:38.111]  By the way, you go up to InfoWars.com.
[03:00:38.151 --> 03:00:39.472]  Big article by Curt Nemo.
[03:00:39.872 --> 03:00:44.115]  Illinois Senate defeats Governor's sneaky attempt to ban assault weapons.
[03:00:44.135 --> 03:00:45.176]  That means semi-autos.
[03:00:46.164 --> 03:00:50.666]  They are really after the Second Amendment by hook or by crook with their criminal energy.
[03:00:51.086 --> 03:00:56.008]  New Democrats, Al Qaeda Pentagon dinner guest was part of catch and release program.
[03:00:56.588 --> 03:00:57.148]  Amazing.
[03:00:58.209 --> 03:00:59.429]  Medical tyranny is here.
[03:00:59.449 --> 03:01:03.891]  Elementary school places unruly kids in solitary confinement.
[03:01:04.872 --> 03:01:09.333]  All of that is First Amendment cop becomes internet icon.
[03:01:09.353 --> 03:01:11.734]  It's all up there right now.
[03:01:11.754 --> 03:01:15.436]  Whistleblower targeted by TSA revealing too much information.
[03:01:16.789 --> 03:01:22.251]  Yeah, I want to know what's going on with the dollar, but honestly, I want to know what's going on in Las Vegas, because I see
[03:01:41.741 --> 03:01:47.663]  Plain spring like crazy and it's like it's basically springtime here.
[03:01:47.803 --> 03:01:50.825]  It's just like the vaccines and the fluoride that gives you cancers on record.
[03:01:51.185 --> 03:01:53.826]  The government is helping you right now Trent.
[03:01:55.135 --> 03:01:56.375]  Yeah, I understand that.
[03:01:56.456 --> 03:01:57.716]  And like, people don't understand this.
[03:01:57.756 --> 03:01:59.877]  Like, I'm asking them, like, what the hell is going on?
[03:01:59.897 --> 03:02:02.297]  And they're like, oh, that's just a plane.
[03:02:02.337 --> 03:02:04.798]  I'm like, no, there's a plane right there, and that doesn't have a jet.
[03:02:04.838 --> 03:02:06.119]  That's a normal jet stream.
[03:02:06.159 --> 03:02:07.239]  Never mind that.
[03:02:07.299 --> 03:02:09.060]  Breathe deeply, and the pain will leave.
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:11.520]  Take the shots, and everything will just be a haze.
[03:02:12.801 --> 03:02:15.622]  You know, to be serious, you're asking about what's happening with the dollar.
[03:02:15.642 --> 03:02:17.863]  Lindsey Williams says he has the biggest info ever.
[03:02:19.858 --> 03:02:23.060]  Alex, thank you so much, but I will be ready to come on December 1st.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.043]  And so, he will be joining us on December 1st.
[03:02:28.183 --> 03:02:30.284]  I guess that's... What is December 1st?
[03:02:32.766 --> 03:02:34.687]  After December 1st, so like Monday or something?
[03:02:34.707 --> 03:02:36.688]  Okay, we'll call him now.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:39.100]  And he's so nice.
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:42.921]  You get him on the phone, he'll just tell you, God bless you, let me pray with you now.
[03:02:43.402 --> 03:02:44.242]  He's just a good guy.
[03:02:44.302 --> 03:02:45.482]  So we all love Lindsey Williams.
[03:02:45.542 --> 03:02:46.603]  Other listeners do as well.
[03:02:47.103 --> 03:02:49.023]  We've had listeners begging for Williams.
[03:02:49.303 --> 03:02:51.804]  And his last interviews were his most cogent and to the point ever.
[03:02:52.764 --> 03:02:54.725]  So he will be joining us to try to give us his take.
[03:02:54.745 --> 03:03:03.508]  We're going to get Max Keiser on to give us his take on... I've got a special video report coming out tonight, if not tomorrow, probably on the radio show tomorrow, on
[03:03:04.708 --> 03:03:06.450]  JPMorgan Chase to head up the Treasury.
[03:03:06.730 --> 03:03:08.031]  Paul, they head up the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:08.271 --> 03:03:11.274]  And they're running TV ads about how they brought you Thanksgiving.
[03:03:11.314 --> 03:03:11.895]  I'm not kidding.
[03:03:12.555 --> 03:03:14.297]  When they are the antithesis of Thanksgiving.
[03:03:15.318 --> 03:03:16.779]  Unless you want to give thanks to Satan.
[03:03:16.839 --> 03:03:17.620]  So, anything else, sir?
[03:03:18.655 --> 03:03:21.778]  Yeah, when do you think they're going to see the 401Ks?
[03:03:21.818 --> 03:03:24.061]  Because I keep talking to my mom about them.
[03:03:24.101 --> 03:03:25.442]  I'm trying to get my mom involved.
[03:03:25.562 --> 03:03:31.468]  They're having congressional hearings about the government safeguarding them, but of course taking part of it.
[03:03:31.508 --> 03:03:33.791]  And they're already talking about taxing them.
[03:03:33.811 --> 03:03:34.832]  So you can just type that in.
[03:03:35.452 --> 03:03:38.595]  Congress moving to tax or take over IRAs.
[03:03:38.616 --> 03:03:39.737]  I mean, that's been in the news lately.
[03:03:41.435 --> 03:03:43.636]  My family is just all about Fox News.
[03:03:43.696 --> 03:03:46.558]  I'm like, you have nothing in common with these people.
[03:03:46.578 --> 03:03:47.699]  These people are millionaires.
[03:03:48.079 --> 03:03:51.141]  They're like, oh Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney.
[03:03:51.161 --> 03:03:52.422]  Mitt Romney's fucking crazy.
[03:03:52.782 --> 03:03:53.223]  I hear you.
[03:03:53.263 --> 03:03:54.444]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:03:54.464 --> 03:03:55.504]  We'll have to delay that.
[03:03:56.665 --> 03:03:59.007]  Delay part of the little dirty words you just said.
[03:03:59.027 --> 03:04:01.208]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:01.268 --> 03:04:04.551]  Sorry to Michael, or Michelle, and Anthony, and others.
[03:04:05.211 --> 03:04:06.511]  I shall return.
[03:04:06.551 --> 03:04:12.073]  The retransmission comes up with a lot of key intel dealing with my take on 2012 from the first hour.
[03:04:12.993 --> 03:04:19.874]  But tonight's nightly news is going to be powerful and we have some real treats for you in information warfare in the next few days.
[03:04:20.134 --> 03:04:21.215]  And Katie, bar the door.
[03:04:21.235 --> 03:04:25.615]  Aaron Dykes is in there working very hard on a special report I'm doing on JP Morgan.
[03:04:26.116 --> 03:04:27.476]  So start your engines on that.
[03:04:27.536 --> 03:04:28.696]  It should be ready by tomorrow.
[03:04:29.156 --> 03:04:30.937]  And we have a bunch of other special reports.
[03:04:31.037 --> 03:04:31.737]  And my son!
[03:04:32.637 --> 03:04:34.158]  Hey, you've heard him on the radio.
[03:04:34.198 --> 03:04:35.279]  How about video?
[03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:39.422]  That should be ready by tomorrow as well.
[03:04:40.122 --> 03:04:40.883]  I love this song.
[03:04:41.043 --> 03:04:41.864]  This is what you want.
[03:04:42.164 --> 03:04:42.864]  This is what you get.
[03:04:42.884 --> 03:04:50.870]  There's a lot of negative stuff going on, but we got to have gallows humor and try to speak sanity to the establishment as well as the general public.
[03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:58.215]  And I think humanity is going to make it if we say a little prayer as well, but put that prayer into action to all of our listeners and supporters.
[03:04:58.756 --> 03:04:59.256]  I love you.
[03:04:59.276 --> 03:05:01.438]  Free transmission coming up.
[03:05:05.390 --> 03:05:11.357]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard
