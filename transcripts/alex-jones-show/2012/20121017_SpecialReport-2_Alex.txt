[00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:11.334]  Magazine.
[00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:12.595]  Yeah, sure.
[00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:14.956]  Magazine, miss.
[00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:21.199]  Thank you.
[00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:21.719]  Thank you.
[00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.739]  Fake club.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.281]  That's all you get.
[00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:26.861]  What is it, man?
[00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:32.584]  Oh, this is, they made a glossy cover, huh?
[00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:33.024]  Oh yeah.
[00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.160]  Free magazine, sir.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.520]  Thank you.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.461]  Thank you, sir.
[00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.823]  Yeah, free.
[00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:49.523]  Thanks, man.
[00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:50.324]  Check it out.
[00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:06.986]  Alex Jones is doing COINTELPRO.
[00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.088]  He works for the CIA and the Fed.
[00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:09.468]  He does.
[00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:10.469]  He's a Fed.
[00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.350]  Now we hear this often.
[00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.512]  I'm interested what's your take.
[00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.232]  He could be.
[00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:27.982]  I don't think he's CIA.
[00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:29.583]  I think he's just an entertainer.
[00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.305]  He contradicts himself every day.
[00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.967]  FEMA camps and all that, you know, and hey, look, the caskets are over here.
[00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:37.009]  Do you recognize anything as a FEMA camp?
[00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.651]  Do you recognize the existence of any of them?
[00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:41.232]  I'm less worried about it.
[00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:45.915]  Alex could be getting a list of everybody who's a potential risk that are going to go into those FEMA camps.
[00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:47.556]  He contradicts himself every day.
[00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:49.218]  Look what he did to the Occupy people.
[00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.239]  He's nothing but a tension monger.
[00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.180]  It's not about Alex.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.621]  It ain't happening.
[00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.323]  You talked about the Occupy Movement.
[00:01:56.924 --> 00:01:59.306]  Now, you said Alex Jones did what to the Occupy Movement?
[00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:00.027]  Well, it wasn't the Occupy.
[00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:03.010]  It was a group that was out trying to do something, and I've got to remember.
[00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.253]  There's contradictions and stuff every day.
[00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:07.474]  Free newspaper?
[00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:08.595]  Anybody?
[00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:09.296]  Free newspaper?
[00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:10.998]  Thank you.
[00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.388]  Do you have a free newspaper, ma'am?
[00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:32.132]  You have a free newspaper?
[00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:32.474]  Thank you.
[00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:00.426]  Who controls the present, controls the past.
[00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:05.947]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:08.348]  All you gotta do is start looking around.
[00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:10.329]  Start thinking for yourself.
[00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.189]  Start investigating things.
[00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.590]  And you will see it all right there.
[00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.131]  So you have the power.
[00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:20.011]  Humanity has the power.
[00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:21.552]  We have the power.
[00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:22.552]  You wanna fight?
[00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.673]  You better believe you got one!
[00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:30.267]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:03:30.907 --> 00:03:34.851]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
