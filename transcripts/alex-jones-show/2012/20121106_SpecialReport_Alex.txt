[00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:18.687]  Every day the mainstream media inundates us with articles talking about how the Earth is overpopulated and humans need to die in order to save the world.
[00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:28.653]  They throw out the number 7 billion like it's an accusation and a curse, talking about how we're basically parasites and we're sucking the Earth's dry resources.
[00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:33.356]  Every day you see these stories come out, like in Time, where they talk about how to die.
[00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:38.539]  In the LA Times, they asked the question, the world's biggest problem, and they answered it with, too many people.
[00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:46.702]  One Washington Post op-ed even said, living within our global means will require a radical drop in the earth's population starting now.
[00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:48.723]  And they sought fit to publish that.
[00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:57.487]  So the mainstream media continues to program us to accept population control and tell us the world is overpopulated as if this is just an incontrovertible
[00:00:58.047 --> 00:00:58.367]  Fact.
[00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:00.789]  They use broad, vague terms, throwing that out there.
[00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:10.354]  But if you actually go and look at the data, every industrialized nation is having either a zero population growth rate or even a negative population growth rate.
[00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:12.055]  Birth rates are down across the map.
[00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:14.057]  Fertility rates are down across the map.
[00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:18.979]  And in the United States, birth rates have even fallen to the lowest level since the Great Depression.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.582]  And last year, our fertility rates were the lowest on recorded U.S.
[00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:23.062]  record.
[00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:27.824]  Some of the countries that have the highest birth rates are in Africa, like Niger and Uganda.
[00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:34.728]  However, these countries also have some of the lowest life expectancies, where people are only living to be in their 40s and 50s.
[00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:38.550]  Now, on the other hand, what is rising is disease rates.
[00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.693]  The World Health Organization has brought forth evidence to show that Alzheimer's is going to be doubling every 20 years.
[00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:48.775]  Childhood leukemia and brain cancers are going up 1% every year for the last 20.
[00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:52.457]  And autoimmune disorders are rocketing off the charts.
[00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:59.042]  What this clearly suggests is that we're having an environmental factor at play here because human genes don't change this fast.
[00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:01.324]  What environmental factors might those be?
[00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:02.245]  Well, take your pick.
[00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:04.686]  Vaccines, GMO, fluoride, chemtrails.
[00:02:05.107 --> 00:02:08.710]  Big Pharma kills more people every year than most cancers except for lung.
[00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.353]  Yesterday we even covered a story linking aspartame to several types of cancer.
[00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:16.776]  But overpopulation is a myth and the way they have this
[00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:40.957]  Added on is they take the depopulation agenda, and they tuck it into the green movement So they make you feel all good and warm inside about doing something good for the environment And then they just add on the fact that we need to depopulate the earth that we need to have less children You need to kill your grandma so that you can protect the world and the Population Research Institute has actually put out a video entitled overpopulation is a myth and we're going to go to that clip right now
[00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:45.197]  Who claimed that reckless human reproduction had overwhelmed the Earth.
[00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:51.678]  Massive famines would result, which would destroy, best case scenario, one-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s.
[00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:53.338]  And the planet would follow.
[00:02:54.038 --> 00:03:03.720]  This fear produced large donations for the newly created UNFPA, which thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent and rescheduled again and again over the past two centuries.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.661]  The population of Earth will peak in 30 years, and then start to go back down.
[00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:10.281]  We're not overpopulated.
[00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.361]  Do the math.
[00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:19.846]  PRI isn't the only institute that's come out to say that every family on Earth could have a house with a yard in a landmass the size of Texas.
[00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:24.469]  And Texas is only 269,000 square miles of the Earth's 57.5 million, if that gives you any indication.
[00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:40.374]  And over the years we have eugenicists coming out saying we need to depopulate the earth for various reasons, whereas today we have billionaire eugenicists like Al Gore coming forward, pushing the carbon tax initiative.
[00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:52.897]  He wants you to pay taxes on breathing, and he stands to make billions off of these should they pass, so that he can fly around in private jets and spend $30,000 a year on his utility bills for his mansion.
[00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:54.501]  And he's not alone.
[00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:58.213]  We have other billionaire eugenicists up there with him like Ted Turner and Bill Gates.
[00:03:58.253 --> 00:03:59.457]  Let's go to a clip of these guys.
[00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.827]  More American servicemen are dying now.
[00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:04.447]  Suicide?
[00:04:04.687 --> 00:04:08.009]  Of some suicide over there, that are dying in combat.
[00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.069]  That's shocking, isn't it?
[00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.131]  Well, what, no, I think it's good.
[00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:20.235]  And so the access that used to be available to the middle class or whatever is just rapidly going away.
[00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:27.899]  That's a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say,
[00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.501]  So as you can see, there's Ted Turner telling us that it's really great.
[00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:52.377]  That troops are committing suicide in mass record numbers and Bill Gates telling us we need to kill our grandmother so that we can hire more teachers.
[00:04:52.797 --> 00:04:58.641]  Notice all of these guys are advocating population reduction but none of them are personally volunteering.
[00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:04.746]  Also keep in mind this number seven billion that they keep pushing out, scientists, that's an estimate that scientists have.
[00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:12.471]  Other studies are coming out now to say that the world is actually a third less populated than they thought before based on using the wrong models.
[00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:23.920]  But the bottom line is here that we have billionaire eugenicists like Al Gore, Ted Turner, and Bill Gates with wealth, power, and influence using that to basically play God and decide who gets to live and die.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.047]  And the bought-and-paid-for mainstream media continues to push this idea that you need to have less children, you need to kill your grandmother, and that people need to die so that we can all save the earth.
[00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:35.568]  The bottom line here is that we're being lied to.
[00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:38.951]  We're being poisoned and we're being robbed on a massive scale.
[00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:43.262]  Scale overpopulation is a myth and it's a scam.
[00:05:43.783 --> 00:05:45.808]  I'm Melissa Melton for InfoWars Nightly News.
