[00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:25.500]  Welcome to InfoWars Nightly News, this Monday, January 16th edition of 2012.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.242]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex Jones tonight.
[00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:43.628]  We have a lot of breaking news ahead for you here, and an interview with Ed Corcoran from Survivalist Magazine is going to be talking to us about global events and the Strait of Hormuz in Iran, possibility of war with Iran, and many other topics.
[00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:44.769]  But first, breaking news.
[00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:57.298]  On the GMO front, we have news right out of the state of Washington, where state Senator Marilyn Chase has introduced a bill that would require the labeling of genetically engineered foods sold in that state.
[00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.740]  She says, quote, people have the right to know what they're eating.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.821]  Can you imagine that?
[00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:18.321]  Now this bill states that by July 2014 all genetically engineered raw foods must be clearly labeled with the words genetically engineered and processed foods must include a label that states that the product may contain genetically engineered ingredients and it must name those ingredients on the label.
[00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:30.712]  Now you may recall that there's already a ballot initiative measure underway in California that hopes to put a bill on the ballot that would require the mandatory labeling of genetically engineered ingredients in California.
[00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:34.455]  Combine that with Washington and then you only have Oregon left out of the scene.
[00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:43.002]  You could have the entire West Coast a new realm of mandatory GMO labeling that could set a precedent to spread to the rest of the states.
[00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:46.029]  Now moving on, more breaking news.
[00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.372]  Ron Paul receives a game-changing endorsement from a South Carolina senator.
[00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:52.593]  This is a big deal.
[00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:54.834]  The state, I'm sorry, the U.S.
[00:01:54.934 --> 00:02:03.679]  Senator, I'm sorry, State Senator Tom Davis from South Carolina is considered a heavyweight, a very influential individual in that state.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.221]  And he says there's, this is his quote,
[00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:12.866]  There's only one person, only one person speaking to what I believe is the core problem of our country today.
[00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:15.968]  The biggest threat to our liberty comes from debt.
[00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:23.173]  There is only one candidate that is talking about this problem to the degree, at the scale, and with the scope that it needs to be talked about.
[00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:26.135]  You can't nibble around the edges anymore.
[00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:30.439]  And we now have a short video clip of State Senator Tom Davis explaining more.
[00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:36.811]  We need drastic, radical return to the principles this country was founded upon.
[00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:48.960]  And if you look at Dr. Paul, and if you look at the lonely battle that he's fought up there in Washington, D.C., and if you look at the courage that he has shown, and if you look at the withstanding of the pressure that I know he's under, because I feel it in Columbia.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.003]  I feel it in Columbia all the time.
[00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.106]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:43.694]  And talking about the Federal Reserve, and talking about quantitative easing, and talking about monetary policy, and talking about how it values our dollar, and talking about that's key to the public and our economy, he has brought to the forefront ideas that five or six years ago, people had no idea what you were talking about.
[00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:47.016]  Now, everybody in this field talking about it.
[00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:48.717]  We have Dr. Ron Cawthon.
[00:03:54.545 --> 00:04:02.832]  Alright, well the audio wasn't great on that, but the important point is that Tom Davis has officially and publicly endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:03.973]  That's a very powerful endorsement.
[00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:10.419]  We now have a short video clip from Jesse Benton who's talking about how Ron Paul is now surging in the polls.
[00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.300]  We're surging in South Carolina.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.423]  We've got the resources, we've got the grassroots, and most importantly, we've got the winning message.
[00:04:16.963 --> 00:04:28.831]  People in South Carolina are looking for a candidate that will really cut the spending, be serious about this debt that we've got exploding, and really, really go to the White House to cut the spending and get this government under control.
[00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:32.074]  They know Dr. Paul's got the credibility, and Dr. Paul will do what he says.
[00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:33.895]  We're surging in South Carolina.
[00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:41.578]  Good news is that over 1.3 million dollars has already been raised in South Carolina for Ron Paul's election.
[00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:44.819]  A lot more of that coming, no doubt, with future money bombs.
[00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:53.062]  Now moving on to additional news that still involves Ron Paul, however, look at the outrageous, overreaching, tyrannical
[00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:55.652]  Actions of the EPA.
[00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:57.956]  I mean, this is an agency that's completely out of control.
[00:04:58.476 --> 00:04:58.757]  The U.S.
[00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:04.564]  Supreme Court has now heard the opening arguments of a case known as Sackett versus the EPA.
[00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.870]  And Ron Paul calls it an outrageous overreach of the EPA.
[00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:11.472]  And in his address, he talked about it.
[00:05:11.513 --> 00:05:23.121]  He says, unless Congress acts, EPA bureaucrats will continue to inflict potentially devastating economic consequences on communities like Matagorda County and people like the Sacketts.
[00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:26.144]  Destroying the economy is no way to save the environment.
[00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:33.629]  A thriving economy and a fair judicial system that respects property rights and the Constitution provides the best protection of the environment.
[00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.753]  We also have a video clip of Ron Paul's address that covers this very issue.
[00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:39.374]  Let's go to that.
[00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:50.416]  Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Sackett v. EPA, a case of blatant federal agency overreach and abuse of private property rights.
[00:05:51.876 --> 00:06:00.678]  Without any proof or reason, and no chance for appeal, the EPA determined that a small, single-home lot was a protected wetland.
[00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:06.959]  The owners, Mike and Chantelle Sackett, were ordered to haul construction already underway
[00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:08.143]  We're good to go!
[00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:39.224]  Outraged, the Sackets sought relief through the courts, but court after court determined that they had no standing.
[00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:46.788]  The actions of the EPA were not subject to judicial review until a mountain of fees had already been assessed.
[00:06:47.509 --> 00:07:01.356]  This is just another example, not only of how federal agencies wield enormous power over the average citizens, but also how little practical protection our courts provide when such citizens are harmed by those agencies.
[00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:09.374]  Constitutionally, when the government determines private property is needed for public use, it is taken through eminent domain.
[00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:16.175]  In that process, the owner is due fair market value in compensation for their condemned property.
[00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:28.398]  The EPA not only refuses to compensate the Sacketts for effectively taking their land, they are assessing, or threatening to assess, ruinous penalties that greatly exceed the value of the land.
[00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:39.758]  They arrogantly claim the power to determine how certain property owners can use their land while assessing fees or ordering actions that must be undertaken at the property's owner's expense.
[00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:45.062]  All of this is done at the administrative level with no judicial oversight.
[00:07:45.363 --> 00:07:50.147]  In short, the EPA does not believe the Constitution applies to them.
[00:07:52.355 --> 00:08:00.002]  One of the the key statements from Ron Paul there that you just heard is that this has been done at the administrative level with no judicial oversight.
[00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:07.489]  This is the rise of tyranny that attorney Jonathan Emord warned us about in his book by that name, The Rise of Tyranny.
[00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:22.457]  He warned that all of these agencies, the EPA, the FTC, the DEA, the FDA, DHS, of course, they have all become their own tyrannical kingdoms, not subject to legal review, not subject to any of the courts.
[00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:30.902]  They simply invent their own law, they implement it in any way they want, and they have become little fiefdom tyrannies in America.
[00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:33.484]  And that's what we're seeing now waged against
[00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:36.827]  The innocent landowners in this case.
[00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:37.387]  I mean, think about it.
[00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:38.468]  They just bought a lot.
[00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:39.870]  They want to build on it.
[00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.374]  And now they have to go through all this crazy hoop-jumping by the EPA.
[00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:45.756]  And they still can't build on it.
[00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:49.860]  And it could cost them more than the lot is worth just to pay the fines to the EPA.
[00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:55.542]  I'm so glad Ron Paul helps bring some common sense to the forefront on that issue.
[00:08:56.203 --> 00:09:06.946]  Now on another issue that might seem a little bit outlandish, we have radioactive products have made their way into the United States and were distributed to retail stores, bed, bath and beyond.
[00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:14.348]  In 20 different states, in fact, have been found to be selling radioactive metallic tissue holders.
[00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:20.728]  These products are made with Cobalt-60, a highly radioactive substance.
[00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:24.252]  It's actually used in radiotherapy devices.
[00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.935]  Yeah, they actually fry cancer tumors to death.
[00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:34.063]  They emit gamma radiation using medical devices and other types of devices, some military devices as well.
[00:09:35.504 --> 00:09:38.306]  How much radiation do these tissue holders emit?
[00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:49.132]  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson David McIntyre said that standing next to one of these for 30 minutes a day would expose you to the equivalent of a couple of chest x-rays a year.
[00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:51.880]  Well, what happens if you sleep next to one?
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:10:02.267]  If you have one on the bed stand by the bed, and you're sleeping next to it for 10 hours a night, you're going to get the equivalent of potentially a hundred or a couple of hundred chest x-rays a year.
[00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:13.695]  And interestingly, the mainstream media, well, the corporate run hoax media, we should say, has said there is no danger for possessing one of these devices, but they failed to say
[00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:21.343]  That if you are caught with one of these devices, you could be arrested, detained, prosecuted, and interrogated under both the U.S.
[00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:28.151]  Patriot Act for having a weapon of mass destruction, as well as the NDAA recently signed by Obama.
[00:10:28.191 --> 00:10:30.273]  Yeah, you have materials to make a dirty bomb.
[00:10:30.874 --> 00:10:33.296]  And you bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond.
[00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:39.822]  In fact, you could get arrested by the TSA at a roadside checkpoint just trying to return the product and get your money back.
[00:10:40.263 --> 00:10:45.828]  And if you bury it in the yard, well, the EPA comes in and seizes your entire property and says you can't build anything on it.
[00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:47.889]  So what do you do?
[00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:53.454]  You're now stuck as a victim in a police state society that's selling you radioactive products
[00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:57.678]  And then accusing you for having the random bad luck to get cancer.
[00:10:58.739 --> 00:10:59.680]  It's a crazy world, yeah.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.703]  Speaking of cancer, moving on to thyroid cancer.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.986]  Doctors are now scratching their heads and wondering why thyroid cancer cases are on the rise in America.
[00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:14.949]  Thyroid cancer has been skyrocketing faster than any other form of cancer.
[00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:21.774]  The National Cancer Institute has statistics that suggest the number of cases has increased by about 6.5 percent.
[00:11:22.094 --> 00:11:27.959]  I believe that's an annual number over a decade that has added up to making thyroid cancer the fastest increasing cancer.
[00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:38.689]  We have thyroid cancer specialists who say, or one woman says, ten years ago, if I saw four new thyroid cancer patients a year, that would have been a lot.
[00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:46.057]  That's from G. Irene Minor, a radiation oncologist with Indiana University Health's Central Indiana Cancer Center.
[00:11:46.938 --> 00:11:50.542]  Now, she says, sometimes I see that many in a month, and I have seen three.
[00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:52.324]  In a week.
[00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:56.009]  What makes you wonder what's going on with all of the cancer?
[00:11:56.289 --> 00:11:56.950]  What's behind it?
[00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.751]  What are the causes?
[00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:05.260]  Well, USA Today reports that obesity, radiation exposure, and diets low in fruits and vegetables are 3 potential culprits.
[00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:07.696]  And they're quoting a man named Huntley there.
[00:12:07.996 --> 00:12:09.897]  You notice they don't say Fukushima?
[00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:17.781]  You notice they don't say radiation from nuclear accidents blowing over into North America, dropping onto your soils and getting into your food?
[00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.823]  You notice they don't mention the radioactive products that you might be purchasing from bed, bath and beyond?
[00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:23.724]  No!
[00:12:24.104 --> 00:12:26.085]  You're not eating enough fruits and vegetables!
[00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:27.546]  That's their only answer!
[00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:34.988]  It's quite remarkable, but this is just another example of how the corporate-run media downplays real dangers.
[00:12:35.328 --> 00:12:49.892]  Radiation is a real danger to your health, while exaggerating fake imaginary dangers like the War on Terror, which is mostly just engineered and fabricated, as you well know, as a regular viewer of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:52.973]  Now, we have more news for you here tonight.
[00:12:53.593 --> 00:12:54.934]  The LA Times is reporting
[00:12:56.044 --> 00:13:06.199]  The TSA, speaking of radiation, the TSA plans now, after so much pressure on it, to test the machines and test the workers there at the airports.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.947]  The TSA says it's going to test its airport scanner operators for radiation exposure.
[00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:13.289]  That's right.
[00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:19.733]  After years of rebuffing health concerns over airport scanners, they say they plan to conduct new tests.
[00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.696]  Well, hey, they can say they plan to do anything.
[00:13:23.016 --> 00:13:30.502]  They said they plan to stop molesting your grandma and removing her colostomy bag while she was sitting in her wheelchair trying to get through airport security.
[00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:32.363]  But did they stop doing that?
[00:13:32.383 --> 00:13:32.423]  No.
[00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:38.867]  They said they would stop molesting little children and searching for poop bombs in their diapers, but did they stop doing that?
[00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:40.027]  No, they didn't.
[00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:41.788]  They can say anything they want.
[00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:47.832]  If there's anything that we've learned in the last couple of years, it's that the TSA lies to you every chance they get.
[00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:52.354]  And they're lying to their own employees by saying, oh, it's a safe work environment.
[00:13:52.814 --> 00:13:54.095]  Whoa, your hair is glowing?
[00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:55.316]  Your thyroid has cancer?
[00:13:55.656 --> 00:13:57.597]  Don't worry, it's a safe work environment.
[00:13:58.177 --> 00:14:13.100]  But if they do follow through with this promise, they're going to have their workers wearing dosimeters so they can actually monitor the amount of radiation they get and see just how badly they're being fried from the radiation-emitting security devices that they have you and I walk through.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:22.702]  And they continue to lie, by the way, to say that these have been certified as safe by the NIST, even though the NIST has publicly said that is not true.
[00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:23.902]  Just another lie.
[00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:26.163]  From the TSA.
[00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:37.907]  Now we have another article on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson, breaking down the health effects of these radiation devices, the naked body scanners being used by the TSA.
[00:14:39.027 --> 00:14:44.729]  And this story is entitled, TSA to Test Body Scanner Operators for Radiation Exposure.
[00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:53.712]  It cites numerous studies from John Hopkins, Columbia University, the University of California, and the Interagency Committee on Radiation Safety.
[00:14:54.452 --> 00:15:02.120]  It says that a cluster of cancer cases has now been detected among TSA workers, and you can find more about that story at Infowars.com.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.925]  There's another story, also by Paul Joseph Watson, published at Infowars.com.
[00:15:07.185 --> 00:15:12.891]  Cancer surges in body scanner operators, and the TSA launches a cover-up.
[00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:17.276]  Well, what more would you expect from the TSA than a cover-up?
[00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:27.241]  Fearful of provoking further public resistance to naked airport body scanners, the TSA has been caught covering up a surge of cases in TSA workers developing cancer.
[00:15:27.682 --> 00:15:33.525]  The story reports, and you can read more about that story by Paul Watson right there on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:38.868]  Never a day goes by that we aren't entertained by the TSA's lies.
[00:15:39.368 --> 00:15:44.832]  There's always something, it's usually involving elderly women or diapers or radiation.
[00:15:46.072 --> 00:15:51.416]  It's like a bad Beavis and Butthead episode run by the federal government or something.
[00:15:51.436 --> 00:15:52.997]  I'm not sure how they get to all that.
[00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:59.102]  Moving on, dead on arrival, SOPA is now shelved.
[00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:01.103]  And we don't know if it's permanently shelved or not.
[00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:02.164]  That's right.
[00:16:03.044 --> 00:16:14.633]  This is the Online Intellectual Property Act, SOPA, the anti-piracy act, I should say, that said it was going to stop piracy, but in fact was just a government censorship bill to try to take down websites
[00:16:15.253 --> 00:16:17.775]  Publishing information that the government did not like.
[00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:22.057]  And here's a quote from shtfplan.com.
[00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:39.488]  While this bill of goods was being sold to the American public as a way to reduce online piracy, in essence, the legislation would have made it possible for any organization to target websites using excerpts, quotes, and videos without express permission of the authors or producers of such content.
[00:16:40.268 --> 00:16:43.730]  So, dead on arrival now, SOPA shelved indefinitely.
[00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.911]  Believe it or not, the White House has now come out against it.
[00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:53.314]  Although, don't forget, Obama said he wasn't going to sign the NDAA, and yet he did.
[00:16:53.994 --> 00:16:56.875]  So, Obama, he can say anything he wants.
[00:16:57.215 --> 00:16:58.436]  He can say he's against it.
[00:16:58.696 --> 00:17:04.699]  He can be just like the TSA and lie to your face, and at the end of the day, he may end up signing it anyway.
[00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.921]  That is a tactic they're now using.
[00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:16.551]  Well, hey, every White House has been using that tactic for a long time to get bills passed, even though they know the bills are offensive to freedom-minded individuals.
[00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:21.957]  And there are a great many of those still remaining here in the great United States of America.
[00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:22.817]  Thank goodness for that.
[00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:24.980]  And thank you for watching, by the way.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.502]  Now, if you consider yourself an American citizen,
[00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:36.688]  And you've been watching the entire debate about the NDAA, you may have come to the realization that, hey, as long as I'm an American citizen, I've got my Bill of Rights, right?
[00:17:37.674 --> 00:17:54.499]  Well, what if they could strip you of your citizenship, then they could arrest you, detain you, interrogate you, assassinate you, put you in Gitmo or some other secret military prison and do basically anything they wanted to you, strip you of your due process rights, deny you a lawyer and do anything they want to you without ever charging you with a crime.
[00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:59.220]  This is what is now possible under the new Enemy Expatriation Act.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.961]  This is H.R.
[00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:05.363]  Bill 3166, with an accompanying Senate Bill 1698.
[00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:10.186]  And Alex Jones had something to say about this.
[00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:23.634]  As you might imagine, he said, the Enemy Expatriation Act is similar to the Nazi faction's Nuremberg Laws, where Adolf Hitler took away German citizenship based on race, blood types, and those against the Hitler regime.
[00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:38.727]  Now what's important to note about this is that, oh wait a minute, here's a quote from the Story Digital Journal, whether American citizens who are guaranteed due process of law by their Bill of Rights were included in the authority of the NDAA was not made absolutely clear.
[00:18:39.688 --> 00:18:40.869]  Here's why this matters.
[00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:49.112]  You see, when this bill, the Enemy Expatriation Act, is combined with the NDAA, then you have a two-pronged assault on your liberty.
[00:18:49.572 --> 00:18:56.235]  You see, Obama was explaining, well, the NDAA doesn't necessarily, it's not really going to be implemented against American citizens.
[00:18:56.515 --> 00:19:06.039]  But then they could say, well, if you support terrorism, or if you're working in opposition to the United States of America, which means the current government,
[00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:13.921]  Then they could first strip you of your citizenship and then nail you under NDAA because you're no longer an American citizen with Bill of Rights Protection.
[00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:14.981]  You see how that works?
[00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:22.942]  It's almost like good cop, bad cop, but it's two bad cops working in conspiracy to strip you of your freedoms.
[00:19:23.643 --> 00:19:26.063]  We have another quote, we already covered that quote there.
[00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:35.065]  Anyway, the good news is that SOPA is now being shelved and I want to give a big shout out to all those out there who worked to help stop this bill.
[00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:55.153]  Including, I forgot the man's name, who is an InfoWars listener who started the boycott of GoDaddy, which was very, very effective, and in fact, we have many other websites that were planning a day to go dark because of SOPA, and believe it or not, Natural News was planning on doing that too.
[00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:56.614]  We were going to go dark on Wednesday, guys.
[00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:58.737]  Now I'm not sure if we're going to do that.
[00:19:59.337 --> 00:20:04.704]  But in any case, this is another example of liberty-minded people standing up for their rights and stopping a very bad bill.
[00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:13.173]  But remember, you must have eternal vigilance because the powers that be will try to bring this back again and again in different forms with different bills.
[00:20:14.278 --> 00:20:16.419]  Now we have some more health news for you tonight.
[00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:21.201]  A totally drug-resistant form of tuberculosis has now been reported in India.
[00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:25.083]  Yeah, really drug-resistant and it's extremely fatal too.
[00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:28.364]  So far a 25% fatality rate.
[00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:29.985]  How big is that rate?
[00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:33.586]  Well, remember the swine flu from a couple years ago that they were scaring us about?
[00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:37.028]  That only had a fatality rate of something like 1% or even less.
[00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:40.009]  Well, this is reported in the New York Daily News.
[00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:50.644]  That now 12 have been infected with this completely drug-resistant strain of TB, 3 have already died, and 9 are clinging to life in India.
[00:20:51.025 --> 00:21:00.172]  This is, of course, the result of the widespread abuse of antibiotics, and it means that conventional medicine has absolutely no way to help these people.
[00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:08.612]  It also means that if this strain is somehow carried to the United States, that hospitals will become death zones.
[00:21:09.112 --> 00:21:10.093]  It's not an exaggeration.
[00:21:10.773 --> 00:21:20.137]  Hospitals are already infected with almost epidemic levels of superbugs, and a superbug drug-resistant form of TB could just be added to that.
[00:21:20.517 --> 00:21:23.018]  Hey, it's another reason to keep your vitamin D levels up, folks.
[00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:29.021]  Get into some good nutrition and take care of your health, because TB is getting worse around the planet.
[00:21:30.203 --> 00:21:35.265]  Speaking of health news, let's combine some health with some surveillance in our public schools, shall we?
[00:21:35.805 --> 00:21:41.748]  Yeah, schools in, I believe in New York, Long Island students are now going to be spied on by school officials.
[00:21:42.328 --> 00:21:45.209]  And have the kids wearing these electronic tracking bracelets.
[00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.311]  Yeah, it tracks their expenditure of calories.
[00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.431]  We're good to go.
[00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:09.287]  And given to insurance companies that then raise the health insurance rates for that family.
[00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:16.330]  Could it be used to diagnose these children with psychiatric disorders and then drug them with brain-altering, psychotropic drugs?
[00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:29.377]  We don't know the answers to that, but we do know that this is being done without parental consent, and it's yet another example of the runaway police state public education system spying on kids and not telling parents
[00:22:30.137 --> 00:22:30.758]  While they're doing it.
[00:22:31.398 --> 00:22:43.867]  Kind of reminds me of the whole vaccine situation in California, you know, where Governor Jerry Brown said, well, you know, now our school children can give permission and consent to be injected with HPV vaccines and the parents don't even have to know about it.
[00:22:44.308 --> 00:22:46.750]  Let's just let it be our little secret, shall we?
[00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.833]  Oh, now we'll track the kids and inject them with vaccines and put them on psychiatric drugs.
[00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:54.916]  And then we'll get paid extra money by the state because we have problem students
[00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:57.698]  Which has extra compensation from taxpayer money.
[00:22:58.078 --> 00:23:02.242]  What a brilliant little scam to fund their little pathetic public school system.
[00:23:03.183 --> 00:23:08.527]  Alright, speaking of pathetic things, have you heard about that ship that capsized off the coast of Italy?
[00:23:09.168 --> 00:23:10.909]  Yeah, it went down like the Titanic!
[00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:18.734]  Listed to one side, and over 4,000 people were on that ship, and most of them managed to get off, but not all of them.
[00:23:18.754 --> 00:23:21.756]  There were fatalities in this, so I don't mean to make light of the fatalities.
[00:23:21.796 --> 00:23:32.403]  That is a tragedy, but it is pathetic that the captain was observed in the bar drinking a beer right before... at least that's what I read in the news report.
[00:23:32.923 --> 00:23:33.503]  But check this out.
[00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:40.568]  The reason I bring this up, and the reason this is relevant to you, is because this is a little metaphor for what's going on in our world today.
[00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:47.405]  Take a look at what some of the passengers said when this ship struck the rock and started to sink.
[00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:54.210]  They said, quote, the lights went off and then came back on again and then everyone just started scrambling over each other.
[00:23:55.631 --> 00:23:56.012]  I'm sorry.
[00:23:56.372 --> 00:23:57.953]  We were sitting at our dinner table.
[00:23:58.514 --> 00:23:59.354]  That quote's coming up.
[00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:01.576]  There's plenty of chaos to go around.
[00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:05.799]  We were sitting at our dinner table when there was a loud bang and things just flew off the table.
[00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:10.422]  The lights went off and then came back on again and then everyone just started scrambling
[00:24:11.363 --> 00:24:13.764]  Over each other to try to get a life vest or to the lifeboats.
[00:24:14.044 --> 00:24:17.706]  People were trampling over each other and the children in the chaos.
[00:24:17.966 --> 00:24:19.267]  We couldn't believe our eyes.
[00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:20.467]  That's the next quote.
[00:24:20.827 --> 00:24:21.928]  It was just utter chaos.
[00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:25.029]  People were rushing about and pushing each other in a panic.
[00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:27.770]  Children were crying and no one seemed to know what was happening.
[00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.132]  We got into a lifeboat and so on and so forth.
[00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:33.913]  That's actual testimony from people on the scene.
[00:24:33.953 --> 00:24:37.995]  Now the reason this is important is because, you see, think about when you're on a cruise boat.
[00:24:38.835 --> 00:24:42.179]  It's kind of an artificial reality and an artificial economy.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.983]  All the food is provided for you, usually all you can eat.
[00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:52.192]  You have your artificial credit card to use on the ship, and the ports that you enter are all artificially made up for tourists.
[00:24:52.552 --> 00:24:56.897]  You know, nice and clean ports all over the Caribbean and everywhere else around the world.
[00:24:58.049 --> 00:24:59.810]  You know, to impress the travelers.
[00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:01.451]  It's an artificial reality.
[00:25:01.832 --> 00:25:07.336]  But then, when the real world hits, oh, we struck a rock, people start to panic.
[00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:18.184]  And I think that this is what could be coming, maybe not just in 2012, but in the years beyond 2012, where a lot of people have been living in a false reality about our economy, about the U.S.
[00:25:18.224 --> 00:25:22.326]  dollar, about debt, about free money and government welfare systems.
[00:25:22.907 --> 00:25:26.730]  And they're going to be really shocked into a rude awakening about reality.
[00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:38.521]  When the real tyranny hits home, when the real crisis becomes apparent to them, they're going to be bailing out the exit doors, running for the lifeboats, and trampling all over each other to try to get food.
[00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:47.769]  Not trying to create a scare message here, just trying to say, you know, maybe we should look for the rocks, not run into things that sink our ship.
[00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.652]  And that's what Ron Paul is trying to warn us about!
[00:25:50.972 --> 00:25:53.134]  Let's not sink the national economy!
[00:25:53.514 --> 00:26:07.826]  Let's observe what's going on out there, do the sonar, do the radar, let's see what the threats might be that are in our way, and let's avoid them, or eliminate them, or solve the problems before they become a crisis, so we can keep our ship afloat!
[00:26:08.646 --> 00:26:12.770]  And that's why I support Ron Paul, and I'm sure that's why many of you do as well.
[00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:14.291]  But man...
[00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:19.277]  Yeah, Cruz is an artificial reality, just kind of like what we're living in today.
[00:26:20.097 --> 00:26:25.199]  Now, on to some news that is a little bit humorous and kind of sick, too.
[00:26:25.399 --> 00:26:28.640]  Actually, we have some men who have been arrested.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.861]  You've heard the story about the goose that lays the golden egg?
[00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:36.362]  Well, these men in Korea were caught smuggling gold nuggets in their rectums.
[00:26:37.102 --> 00:26:41.825]  Yeah, they were trying to bring it into Japan to avoid the import taxes.
[00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:45.867]  Eight men were arrested by South Korean customs officials.
[00:26:46.247 --> 00:26:50.429]  They had a scheme to smuggle gold out of the country by hiding it in their rectums.
[00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:53.371]  Apparently they transformed $260,000 worth of gold bars into small beads.
[00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:03.697]  You know, use their own biology to try to get those out of the country.
[00:27:04.537 --> 00:27:10.059]  I guess this is their way to try to rectify a global price inflation and currency devaluation.
[00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:12.020]  I mean, this is bad.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.942]  I mean, I've heard of national governments dumping gold, but not eight men in Korea.
[00:27:16.982 --> 00:27:19.302]  That's a totally different story.
[00:27:19.602 --> 00:27:20.583]  I will go no further.
[00:27:21.523 --> 00:27:22.043]  On this story.
[00:27:22.083 --> 00:27:25.985]  I'm just glad they weren't trying to smuggle $260,000 worth of silver coins.
[00:27:26.866 --> 00:27:29.767]  That might have been a very painful way to go about it.
[00:27:29.827 --> 00:27:30.888]  Alright, enough of that.
[00:27:30.908 --> 00:27:32.249]  It's a serious topic.
[00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:35.993]  The Daily Quote is next on our agenda here.
[00:27:36.053 --> 00:27:43.898]  Speaking of agenda, we have, oh man, Brzezinski, Zbigniew Brzezinski, I hope I got his name right.
[00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:47.501]  His quote is relevant to what's happening in our world today, so listen up.
[00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:53.525]  Quote, the technocratic age is slowly designing an everyday more controlled society.
[00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:57.448]  The society will be dominated by an elite of persons,
[00:27:57.568 --> 00:27:59.229]  And that's the quote from Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.555]  Is he a famous author or something?
[00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:29.057]  I'm sorry, I'm not familiar.
[00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:31.061]  Oh, the Grand Chess Board.
[00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:32.263]  Alright.
[00:28:34.444 --> 00:28:43.033]  Oh, thank you, Dew, who explains that he helped found Al-Qaeda, Al-Cieda, with other... Okay, never mind.
[00:28:43.053 --> 00:28:44.054]  That's an important quote.
[00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:49.800]  Now, I want to remind you that we do have a special still going here at InfoWars, the InfoWars store.
[00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:54.925]  It has the, what is it, the 99... No, I'm sorry, the 15-day free trial is still going on.
[00:28:55.606 --> 00:29:09.938]  So, a 15-day free trial, no charge, to try out to become a member at PrisonPlanet.tv where you can check out all the nightly news videos and of course you have the ability to share that login password with multiple friends so that you can help inform them as well.
[00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:14.400]  This trial is limited, so check it out now while you still can.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.620]  I know they're not going to keep running this for very long.
[00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:20.282]  Also available is the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[00:29:20.322 --> 00:29:23.083]  It's over $300 worth of DVDs and documentaries.
[00:29:23.643 --> 00:29:27.225]  Everything that Alex Jones has put together in documentary form for just $99.95.
[00:29:27.485 --> 00:29:27.665]  Is it $0.95?
[00:29:31.548 --> 00:29:32.349]  Okay, $99.95.
[00:29:32.629 --> 00:29:34.430]  I own this set myself, by the way.
[00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.551]  Saw some of my Christmas viewing and it was very educational.
[00:29:38.052 --> 00:29:38.652]  It's amazing!
[00:29:38.672 --> 00:29:44.895]  You've got to go back and watch this stuff because now you see how far ahead of the curve Alex Jones really was.
[00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:47.737]  Now stay with us here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:29:47.757 --> 00:29:54.160]  We'll be right back after this break with an interview with Ed Corcoran, who is the founder and editor of Survivalist Magazine.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.721]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in tonight.
[00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:57.261]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.321 --> 00:29:58.062]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:03.439]  America is in trouble.
[00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:05.480]  Washington is a disgrace.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.060]  Government has become too big.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.920]  It's overtaxing, overspending.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.481]  We need to change direction.
[00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:11.621]  We really need change.
[00:30:11.641 --> 00:30:14.421]  We can't afford to make the same mistakes we've made in the past.
[00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:16.722]  Mitt Romney's reputation is a flip-flopper.
[00:30:16.762 --> 00:30:19.983]  He went the other way when he got paid to go the other way.
[00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:22.023]  There is need for economic stimulus.
[00:30:22.043 --> 00:30:23.683]  It's about serial hypocrisy.
[00:30:23.703 --> 00:30:25.464]  This election is about trust.
[00:30:25.684 --> 00:30:29.024]  There's been one true consistent candidate, and that's Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:30:29.084 --> 00:30:32.065]  Ron Paul has been so consistent from the very beginning.
[00:30:32.325 --> 00:30:34.166]  He seems like a more honest candidate.
[00:30:34.186 --> 00:30:36.848]  He tells the truth about what he believes, whether you like it or not.
[00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:41.651]  He's never once voted for a tax increase, never once voted for an unbalanced budget.
[00:30:41.671 --> 00:30:44.533]  Ron Paul's plan is bold, cuts five departments.
[00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:45.554]  It's what we need.
[00:30:45.714 --> 00:30:49.377]  When he says he's gonna cut a trillion dollars in the first year, I believe it.
[00:30:49.457 --> 00:30:54.540]  If you don't like how things are going, and you're tired of politicians, he's something different.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.401]  Ron Paul.
[00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:56.081]  Ron Paul.
[00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:56.802]  Ron Paul.
[00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:57.642]  Ron Paul.
[00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.283]  Is the one we've been looking for.
[00:30:59.303 --> 00:31:01.785]  I'm Ron Paul, and I approve this message.
[00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:31.248]  And it's time to get out of the comfort zone.
[00:31:31.268 --> 00:31:33.710]  Because these people aren't playing games.
[00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:47.159]  We're gonna organize.
[00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:48.780]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.942]  We are swinging muskets here.
[00:31:52.263 --> 00:31:53.724]  Toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[00:31:53.844 --> 00:31:54.584]  They're bloodied.
[00:31:54.684 --> 00:31:55.425]  We're bloodied.
[00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:58.247]  It is absolute total war.

[00:32:55.953 --> 00:33:01.618]  All right, welcome back, and now we're going to be speaking with the founder and editor of Survivalist Magazine.
[00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:04.801]  He's the founder of the website Completesurvivalist.com.
[00:33:05.122 --> 00:33:11.227]  His name is Ed Corcoran, and he's here to talk to us about what he calls a collapse in slow motion.
[00:33:11.868 --> 00:33:16.232]  A lot more going on in the world today that you need to know about, and Ed's here to help analyze it for us.
[00:33:16.372 --> 00:33:19.495]  Ed, thank you for joining us today on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:19.916]  How are you doing?
[00:33:21.076 --> 00:33:22.097]  I'm doing swell, Mike.
[00:33:22.117 --> 00:33:22.957]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:33:23.598 --> 00:33:25.799]  Now, you've got a lot on your mind today with world events.
[00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:29.122]  What do you think are the most important things happening that people need to know about today?
[00:33:30.828 --> 00:33:37.171]  Well, one of the things I like to stress to people is, you know, people ask me all the time, you know, what is the biggest thing to be concerned about?
[00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:52.058]  A lot of people seem to have the notion that, you know, they're going to wake up one morning and our cities are going to be on fire or there's going to be martial law or something, you know, drastic is going to happen immediately overnight and it's just going to be, you know, one, you know, quick event.
[00:33:53.318 --> 00:33:57.941]  What we're really experiencing is what I call a collapse in slow motion.
[00:33:58.741 --> 00:34:03.003]  We are in the midst of a societal and economic collapse right now.
[00:34:03.303 --> 00:34:08.506]  It's just happening by degrees rather than happening in one drastic fell swoop.
[00:34:09.406 --> 00:34:14.549]  Some of the issues that concern me and other survivalists and preppers the most
[00:34:15.249 --> 00:34:16.329]  It is the economy.
[00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:18.710]  Most of us, that's our number one issue.
[00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.650]  I mean, I don't think I need to belabor the point too much.
[00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:30.812]  I think most people realize that, you know, our phony debt-based fiat currency and economic system is unsustainable.
[00:34:31.452 --> 00:34:33.232]  It's designed to collapse.
[00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:38.233]  There is no, you know, what we're doing right now is we're living on borrowed time.
[00:34:38.634 --> 00:34:40.914]  Recently, Obama has asked for yet another
[00:34:41.875 --> 00:34:43.237]  We're good to go!
[00:34:57.797 --> 00:35:03.019]  When you say we're living on borrowed time, I want to ask you specifically about timing.
[00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:06.180]  And by the way, if you don't mind, could you look right at the webcam when you're talking to us?
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:15.302]  What kind of timetable do you think we're dealing with here in terms of the collapse of the EU's financial system or debt collapse of the EU?
[00:35:15.642 --> 00:35:21.204]  And then, what kind of timing for that to ripple back into the United States and affect people here in the USA?
[00:35:22.574 --> 00:35:23.955]  Well, I'm not an economist.
[00:35:24.676 --> 00:35:28.599]  Any kind of prognostication that I could make would simply be a guess.
[00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:44.871]  But based on the folks that I speak to and everybody who does spend the majority of their time following the economy and forecasting, making predictions, it could happen within this year.
[00:35:46.458 --> 00:35:55.602]  Now, that's precluding other situations, and a lot of us are watching the situation going on in Europe, especially Greece right now.
[00:35:55.622 --> 00:35:58.804]  You're not seeing a whole lot of what's going on in Greece in the mainstream media.
[00:35:58.864 --> 00:36:08.408]  Everybody knows that Greece is in default when they're counting on bailouts from Germany and Italy, but it's horrific what's going on there.
[00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:11.270]  I suggest a lot of people take a look at it.
[00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.693]  Go online and take a look at it.
[00:36:14.753 --> 00:36:16.974]  They can't get basic medicines anymore.
[00:36:17.395 --> 00:36:19.176]  People are starving over there.
[00:36:19.236 --> 00:36:20.477]  That's right.
[00:36:20.577 --> 00:36:22.919]  A lot of people in the U.S.
[00:36:22.939 --> 00:36:24.100]  don't know that that's the case.
[00:36:24.981 --> 00:36:31.646]  Pharmacies are begging for medicine in Greece, and that's just a small example of the kind of breakdowns we're going to see.
[00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:35.209]  Now, you're the editor of Survivalist Magazine.
[00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:36.710]  You cover this day in and day out.
[00:36:38.351 --> 00:36:49.233]  And do you think it's realistic for people in the USA and Canada to eventually expect those kinds of shortages to strike home as that economic collapse begins to ripple around the world?
[00:36:50.737 --> 00:36:52.817]  Well, you know, again, it's not an event.
[00:36:53.237 --> 00:36:55.218]  It's happening right now.
[00:36:55.258 --> 00:37:02.039]  I mean, anybody who's been paying attention to the prices in the grocery stores are seeing gradual increases in prices.
[00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:08.740]  And when other factors, I mean, there's a confluence of disasters going on right now.
[00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:15.642]  When you factor in oil, you know, the whole peak oil thing, which, you know, I like to address a little bit.
[00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:16.862]  I know a lot of people out there.
[00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:21.905]  We'll roll their eyes and say, oh, peak oil is a hoax, it's a myth and whatnot.
[00:37:21.945 --> 00:37:23.926]  And I believed that myself at one point.
[00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:33.373]  But, you know, my work through the magazine and through the radio show that I did puts me in contact with a lot of people whose business it is to know about these things.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:34.801]  We're good.
[00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:57.128]  It's costing us more and more energy to extract the oil, and we're having trouble meeting up with demands.
[00:37:57.208 --> 00:38:08.640]  Now, a factor into that as well, M. King Hubbard, who was the one who proposed the Hubbard Curve back in 1956, predicting that peak oil would be achieved, or we would reach peak oil by 1970.
[00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.863]  And he was correct, by the way.
[00:38:12.363 --> 00:38:33.056]  What he didn't factor in was that there are a lot of other countries now who are emerging as major oil consumers, such as China, India, other emerging countries that are just becoming industrialized, who are just joining the party right now, and they're draining the resources and causing the resources to be depleted even faster.
[00:38:33.076 --> 00:38:34.977]  Right, so demand is way up.
[00:38:35.037 --> 00:38:36.818]  That's definitely the case.
[00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:44.040]  I do want to ask you more about peak oil, but first, what about the Strait of Hormuz and the situation with Iran?
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.501]  You know, the U.S.
[00:38:45.541 --> 00:38:48.541]  government is beating the war drums for war with Iran.
[00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:51.402]  Israel is upping their talk about Iran.
[00:38:51.442 --> 00:38:52.942]  There's a lot of pressure on Iran.
[00:38:54.022 --> 00:39:02.064]  How is that likely to impact energy supply to the United States and then trickle through the economy in terms of increased prices?
[00:39:02.104 --> 00:39:03.064]  What's your take on that?
[00:39:04.218 --> 00:39:08.120]  Well, it's already had an effect on the price of oil here in the United States.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.061]  Oil prices have begun rising again.
[00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:17.324]  I think gasoline is up on average of seven cents per gallon right now.
[00:39:17.504 --> 00:39:22.086]  And in the wintertime, typically, historically, this is when oil prices usually go down.
[00:39:22.586 --> 00:39:25.488]  And this is directly related to tension.
[00:39:25.608 --> 00:39:26.648]  Anytime there's any kind of
[00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:29.609]  We're good to go!
[00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:50.514]  Whenever I read about it or research it, it kind of reminds me of several points of history.
[00:39:51.635 --> 00:40:00.161]  Well, first of all, the United States is putting sanctions and threatening embargoes due to Iran's nuclear program.
[00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:11.108]  Now, the International Atomic Energy Association has determined that they're nowhere close to producing weapons-grade uranium.
[00:40:11.778 --> 00:40:12.078]  I think?
[00:40:29.314 --> 00:40:33.837]  That is an act of aggression, and that's very provocative.
[00:40:34.658 --> 00:40:42.184]  That is usually the first thing that governments do when, you know, the first thing they do is they try to cripple another country's economy.
[00:40:42.825 --> 00:40:44.726]  But it can be said that the U.S.
[00:40:44.746 --> 00:40:48.930]  government is intentionally trying to provoke Iran into war.
[00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.492]  I mean, that almost seems obvious at this point.
[00:40:51.572 --> 00:40:54.114]  Why would they be doing that in your analysis?
[00:40:55.189 --> 00:40:55.809]  Absolutely.
[00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:01.713]  Well, you know, it takes me all the way back to Japan with the Roosevelt administration.
[00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:12.900]  You know, most people think that Pearl Harbor, the attack on Pearl Harbor, was completely unprovoked, but what we're not taught in our history class
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:13.560]  Yes.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:13.660]  Yes.
[00:41:30.373 --> 00:41:39.239]  We can go down a line to go back to Iran back in 1953 when the United States was instrumental in removing their president and putting the Shah in power.
[00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:43.561]  It's always the economic guns that come out first.
[00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:55.669]  And so for anybody to say that Iran is overreacting by threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, well, they're kind of doing that in a sense of self-preservation.
[00:41:56.669 --> 00:41:57.530]  They are reacting
[00:41:59.611 --> 00:42:02.013]  It's like an international game of chicken.
[00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:12.902]  There was a secret message delivered to Iran threatening that we would employ embargoes against Iran should they choose to close the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:42:13.662 --> 00:42:21.609]  The United States did not confirm that, and then eventually they did confirm it, but they didn't say what was actually said, or they didn't say where it was coming from.
[00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:27.433]  And just today I read that Iran has acknowledged that they have received this threat from the United States.
[00:42:27.853 --> 00:42:31.376]  Okay, so the economic guns have been brought out for sure.
[00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:34.778]  A lot of strategic political chess playing behind the scenes.
[00:42:35.358 --> 00:42:38.841]  But what about the political guns in terms of the presidential election in the USA?
[00:42:39.401 --> 00:42:42.383]  You know, people always rally behind their president in time of war.
[00:42:42.744 --> 00:42:55.814]  Doesn't it also seem likely that the Obama administration would welcome an act of war right before election day or sufficiently before election day to have time for the country to rally behind him and re-elect the president?
[00:42:56.274 --> 00:43:00.317]  Isn't it almost that, I mean, do you think that's a valid point?
[00:43:01.598 --> 00:43:02.499]  What's your take on it?
[00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.752]  I think, yeah, it's a valid speculation.
[00:43:06.213 --> 00:43:13.279]  And my speculation, and it is a speculation, this is my opinion, is that I think the American people are getting tired of war.
[00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:20.145]  We're getting tired of constantly being engaged in other countries while we're not taking care of our own domestic problems.
[00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:24.809]  So I don't know if that would be advantageous for the Obama administration.
[00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.652]  I don't see that as a rallying point, per se.
[00:43:29.303 --> 00:43:31.204]  I think we're weary of it.
[00:43:31.244 --> 00:43:34.267]  We want to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:43:35.188 --> 00:43:42.634]  We're in the process of pulling out of Iraq, I guess, but Afghanistan... Or at least changing the labels of the soldiers that are still there.
[00:43:43.613 --> 00:43:44.954]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:43:45.014 --> 00:43:59.581]  I mean, you know, and then there's all these contractors, these security contractors and whatnot, and, you know, we have, we're not as, you know, we have, we have military bases in Iraq, we have, if you, if you look at the map of where all the military bases are located in the Middle East, I mean, we're basically surrounding Iran.
[00:44:00.401 --> 00:44:08.366]  In Afghanistan, in Iraq, and I think that was the long-term goal in invading Iraq.
[00:44:08.406 --> 00:44:09.726]  It wasn't so much about oil.
[00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:11.888]  It certainly wasn't about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:44:12.288 --> 00:44:14.649]  It was more about establishing a presence.
[00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.272]  Let me shift gears, if you don't mind, and get to a topic a little closer to home.
[00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:26.456]  You, as the editor of Survivalist Magazine, you do a lot of interviews, you talk to a lot of people out there.
[00:44:27.196 --> 00:44:27.936]  It's 2012.
[00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:30.157]  This is the big year that everyone was talking about.
[00:44:30.197 --> 00:44:33.399]  The Mayan calendar mythology has been floating around out there.
[00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:36.320]  The rapture talk has been out there.
[00:44:37.581 --> 00:44:43.404]  Are you seeing, first of all, an increase in interest in survival or preparedness strategies?
[00:44:44.344 --> 00:44:51.768]  And do you find, my second question is, do you find that people are approaching it from a practical point of view, or is there a sense of
[00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:57.374]  I mean, the Mayan Calendar thing, I would almost call that, you know, unfounded mythology.
[00:44:58.234 --> 00:45:01.819]  What are you seeing out there in terms of real people interested in preparedness?
[00:45:03.135 --> 00:45:09.739]  In terms of the people that I work with and the people that I talk to on a regular basis, no.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:17.444]  The fact that the Mayan calendar ends on December 21, 2012 is largely happenstance.
[00:45:17.524 --> 00:45:18.965]  It doesn't signify anything.
[00:45:19.105 --> 00:45:22.127]  In fact, we have an issue coming out in which we address a lot of 2012 issues.
[00:45:23.508 --> 00:45:46.507]  And we have an article written by a fellow who, Christopher Naguiris, I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly, and he has actually spent time in the Yucatan Peninsula with the Mayan people, the present-day Mayans, and they do not have any kind of interpretation in regards to, like, the end of the world as far as the Mayan calendar ending.
[00:45:46.547 --> 00:45:52.072]  So, if the Mayans don't think that the end of the Mayan calendar signifies the end of the world, then I don't think
[00:45:52.672 --> 00:45:53.553]  That's good enough for me.
[00:45:56.276 --> 00:45:57.438]  Take it from the source.
[00:45:58.539 --> 00:46:03.344]  Then there's all kinds of other fringe theories out there about Planet X and whatnot.
[00:46:04.345 --> 00:46:06.047]  I take a more practical stance.
[00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:09.811]  Just looking around, there's a perfect storm brewing.
[00:46:09.831 --> 00:46:11.032]  These are all issues that
[00:46:13.382 --> 00:46:14.983]  We're right in our faces.
[00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:23.410]  I mean, we don't have to speculate about, you know, any kind of mythical or, you know, and I'm not saying I'm not interested in those things.
[00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:24.151]  I am.
[00:46:24.651 --> 00:46:28.414]  You know, I've always been an avid reader.
[00:46:29.155 --> 00:46:34.119]  No, I mean, what you're saying is that there are plenty of down-to-earth reasons to be prepared.
[00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:39.884]  You don't have to reach for theories in outer space to have a justification to get prepared.
[00:46:39.904 --> 00:46:41.265]  I mean, just look at the Fed, right?
[00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:43.189]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:43.449 --> 00:46:51.452]  And they may not be as dramatic or as sexy or interesting as, say, the planet Nibiru crashing down on us.
[00:46:51.832 --> 00:47:07.217]  But yeah, I mean, with the growing food crisis that we have, increasing disasters, the peak oil issue, water shortages right now, the Ogallala aquifer is being pumped dry, where experts are predicting that.
[00:47:07.717 --> 00:47:14.200]  Eventually, the American breadbasket is going to turn back into the Dust Bowl, you know, and it's the same thing that's happening in other countries.
[00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:18.663]  Overpopulation, this is another issue people roll their eyes about, you know, and I did too.
[00:47:18.683 --> 00:47:19.763]  I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:47:19.783 --> 00:47:24.986]  There's still plenty of real estate to go around, but overpopulation is not about overcrowding, you know.
[00:47:25.186 --> 00:47:30.668]  We may still have plenty of space, but we don't, we're starting to outstrip our resources.
[00:47:30.909 --> 00:47:35.531]  We're using up our water, we're using up our ability for producing food.
[00:47:37.974 --> 00:47:39.456]  We're using up too many resources.
[00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:41.520]  It's getting to the point where...
[00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:45.138]  Nature doesn't have a chance.
[00:47:45.398 --> 00:47:51.383]  Through commercial farming practices, our soil is becoming depleted, and we're losing topsoil.
[00:47:51.463 --> 00:47:56.306]  We're losing the nutrients in the soil because of the way that factory farms operate.
[00:47:56.867 --> 00:47:59.629]  And it's not just here.
[00:47:59.669 --> 00:48:04.232]  You have to really look at what's going on on a global basis in China, in India.
[00:48:04.292 --> 00:48:09.516]  Those people are starving, and they're depleting their aquifers faster than they can be replenished.
[00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:11.017]  They're depleting their soil.
[00:48:11.637 --> 00:48:22.162]  So, you know, yeah, there's a number of issues that, you know, the economy being chief among them that, you know, are just bearing down on us.
[00:48:22.642 --> 00:48:32.567]  Yeah, and I like, Ed, how you describe this as a slow-motion collapse where it's not like you wake up one day and everything's on fire and the whole system has collapsed.
[00:48:32.687 --> 00:48:33.808]  It's actually, I mean,
[00:48:34.568 --> 00:48:44.091]  Maybe in the future, when historians look back at this time, they will call it one event, they'll have one name for this era of change and reform and collapse and rebirth, perhaps.
[00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:47.172]  But when you're living in it, it feels like slow motion.
[00:48:47.192 --> 00:49:02.776]  And I think that's a really wise message from you, that we need to be able to see the signs and recognize that we're in this time of change without needing to see that, oh, the whole world's exploding and aliens are jumping out of their lizard skin and taking the
[00:49:03.616 --> 00:49:07.420]  Taking a Federal Reserve officials back to Planet X or whatever they do.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.385]  I mean, you know, this is real and it's kind of slower than what a lot of people imagine.
[00:49:11.405 --> 00:49:14.868]  Yeah, well, yeah, and you know, people ask me all the time.
[00:49:14.888 --> 00:49:18.632]  Well, you know, for again for predictions, you know, when is when is this going to happen?
[00:49:18.672 --> 00:49:19.253]  What do you think?
[00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:21.015]  How much time do you think we have left?
[00:49:22.027 --> 00:49:22.748]  I think?
[00:49:39.442 --> 00:50:03.800]  It was back in 1859, which wiped out, all we had back then were telegraph lines, but it wiped out our telegraph system and started fires and whatnot, and scientists are saying that we're overdue for that, and this year could possibly be, you know, if we get hit by a solar flare and other issues, the magnetic field around the Earth, there is a major gap in the magnetic field.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.201]  Sure.
[00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:11.928]  What got me interested in survivalism in the first place, you know, I used to be, I classified myself as an outdoorsman.
[00:50:11.968 --> 00:50:15.932]  You know, I just, I just like camping and hiking, living in extreme environments.
[00:50:16.552 --> 00:50:25.701]  And I got woken up by, you know, the fact I saw a documentary that was produced back in the 80s about what actually happens when the grid goes down.
[00:50:26.001 --> 00:50:47.294]  You know, and I think most people, they downplay it or they don't, and they go, we'll just break out the candles and, you know, we'll be fine, you know, but in a long-term situation, you know, power loss situation that will last for years, if our grid crashes due to an EMP or a solar flare which creates, you know, an EMP event,
[00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:54.558]  That could be one of those situations where we wake up one morning and our world is fundamentally transformed.
[00:50:54.578 --> 00:50:58.581]  We're basically back into 19th century existence.
[00:50:59.742 --> 00:51:06.926]  That's where people would really wish they had gone through the skills and practiced these things and not just read the books and watched the TV shows.
[00:51:06.986 --> 00:51:09.088]  Any last thoughts as we wrap this up?
[00:51:10.995 --> 00:51:26.609]  Yeah, well, just to follow up on the grid crash event, I mean, there's going to be a long period of time, too, where there's going to be looting and rioting, and it's going to be very dangerous times, and it's not going to be a good time to live in a city.
[00:51:26.749 --> 00:51:33.635]  So, my recommendation is to all people, and I hope we would have had more time to discuss
[00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:48.982]  The membership site that we have is to be prepared, start stocking up on food, and even if there isn't an economic collapse, food prices are going up, oil prices are going to go up, and oil prices affect the price of everything else.
[00:51:49.002 --> 00:51:56.065]  It takes petroleum to grow our crops, it takes petroleum to transport our crops, it takes petroleum to do everything.
[00:51:56.406 --> 00:52:00.788]  We do not have an infrastructure to live in a non-petroleum-based society.
[00:52:01.568 --> 00:52:21.659]  And so, you know, food storage, even if there is no major economic collapse, you're going to save yourself a lot of money by buying your food now and putting it away, and you'll have that for, you know, if something drastic does happen, you know, overnight, or if we just find ourselves ignoring the road signs and find ourselves in a situation where, like, how did we get here?
[00:52:22.119 --> 00:52:23.880]  You'll have those provisions available.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.502]  And a good place to start is at Completesurvivalist.com.
[00:52:27.542 --> 00:52:28.323]  That's our site.
[00:52:28.343 --> 00:52:30.104]  We have tons of survival guides.
[00:52:30.664 --> 00:52:33.206]  I want to ask you on Natural News as well.
[00:52:33.226 --> 00:52:35.568]  I'm sure Alex will want to talk to you again.
[00:52:48.959 --> 00:52:53.082]  I appreciate you joining us, and I'll give out your website again here for those who want to learn more.
[00:52:53.142 --> 00:53:04.610]  But the bottom line is, you're a guy who's been out there on the front lines of the survival industry, so to speak, and you sort of aggregate all the top knowledge from those out there, different writers.
[00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:13.055]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com, also wrote an article for you, and he's well-informed, so a lot of folks.
[00:53:13.095 --> 00:53:16.618]  So I appreciate what you're doing, and I think you bring a lot of value to the public.
[00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:18.059]  Thanks for joining us tonight, Ed.
[00:53:19.414 --> 00:53:20.395]  Thanks for having me on, Mike.
[00:53:20.415 --> 00:53:20.976]  It was a pleasure.
[00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:22.538]  All right, folks.
[00:53:22.558 --> 00:53:25.641]  That was Ed Corcoran from Completesurvivalist.com.
[00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:27.904]  A lot of good information from him there.
[00:53:28.404 --> 00:53:30.507]  Definitely take this seriously, folks.
[00:53:31.588 --> 00:53:32.048]  2012 is here.
[00:53:32.429 --> 00:53:37.835]  The world is changing rapidly, and it's time to do more than just listen and just be a spectator.
[00:53:38.255 --> 00:53:46.482]  Be an active participant in taking care of your own safety, your own health, your own freedom in 2012 and beyond.
[00:53:46.842 --> 00:53:49.284]  Thank you for watching InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[00:53:49.304 --> 00:53:55.449]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger from Natural News, signing off on Monday, January 16th.
[00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:56.290]  Have a good night.
[00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:57.191]  We'll talk to you again soon.
