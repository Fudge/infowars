[00:00:02.034 --> 00:00:03.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:07.337]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.441]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.161]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.002]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:19.463]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:21.124]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:25.406]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:30.029]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:44.484]  You know, it clicked that Wayne Madsen, three, four months ago, maybe longer, on the nightly news, said he had confidential federal informants that there were wiretaps of Attorney General.
[00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:48.207]  See, it's not just a high-level Justice Department source.
[00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:53.150]  It's supposedly of him that they killed Judge Roll and tried to kill Giffords because they were investigating it.
[00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.153]  Then I talked to some state legislators and people in New Mexico who said that was the word they had heard.
[00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:05.038]  This is going on all over the West Texas, New Mexico, into Arizona.
[00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.100]  Madsen is so wild.
[00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.883]  I mean, the stuff he talks about sometimes sounds so wild that it turns out to be true.
[00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:15.946]  He did work for the NSA, all that.
[00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:17.407]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:22.631]  It is just crazy because now they're revealing secret wiretaps.
[00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.340]  It's been read in the congressional record that they got Holder.
[00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:32.386]  The White House can stage terror attacks, anything, a new war to distract from this.
[00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:33.467]  This is just wild.
[00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.989]  This is absolutely wild.
[00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:46.298]  But again, he's the sacrificial political lamb now that they want to divert us off of the socialist healthcare thing that is being spun as a victory because it'll get Romney in who authored it.
[00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:48.809]  I mean, talk about delusion.
[00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.052]  And I understand politically, yes, that's true.
[00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.754]  It would probably get Romney in.
[00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.675]  But Obama's just a puppet.
[00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.657]  The system, the banks, wanted this.
[00:01:57.757 --> 00:01:58.618]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:01:58.658 --> 00:01:59.138]  I'm ranting.
[00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.521]  Courtney in Virginia, up there by the scene of the crime.
[00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:03.622]  You're on the air.
[00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:04.002]  Welcome.
[00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:05.544]  Hi.
[00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.124]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:06.184 --> 00:02:07.325]  It's good to be on.
[00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:10.588]  I've been listening for a while, but it's my first time calling in.
[00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:11.709]  Thank you for putting up with me.
[00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:12.610]  I know I'm obnoxious.
[00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.910]  Go ahead.
[00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:19.586]  I appreciate the emotion, at least.
[00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:22.609]  It's different than what you see on the zombie mainstream, that's for sure.
[00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.871]  We're here to get you out of the zombification, yes.
[00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:29.415]  Yeah, and your broadcast has definitely played a large part.
[00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:33.338]  I wanted to kind of throw something out there and see if it was something you had considered.
[00:02:33.438 --> 00:02:40.244]  I have a sales and marketing background, so I tend to think of how I can generate more leads or more people.
[00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:43.024]  I don't know.
[00:02:52.116 --> 00:03:01.746]  Maybe devote a segment of your regular broadcast to Obamacare 101, what's in the bill, the implications.
[00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:03.689]  We could maybe reach out.
[00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.572]  Sure, basically they can change it whenever they want, however they want.
[00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:12.658]  It's a federal reserve, take over 35 million people, but it also takes over the general healthcare system.
[00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.000]  It lets the IRS, you have to file with them the type of health care you have.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.641]  They can now take money out of your account.
[00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:25.344]  I mean, it's just the IRS and the nanny state sticking their hand down your pants like the TSA, basically.
[00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:27.745]  Absolutely.
[00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:41.910]  But I think, you know, because there's a large segment of people who are still caught in the left-right paradigm, so they, you know, may identify themselves as, you know, with the GOP or Republican who are semi-awake, but
[00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:47.517]  You know, have the potential to go back to sleep or, you know, along those lines.
[00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:52.980]  But Obamacare is definitely one of those issues that a lot of people are up in arms about, and for good reason.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:11.791]  So I was just kind of positioning that to you, that maybe if you were to do just a portion of your broadcast to Obamacare and consolidate all of the information, that we the listeners could spread the word that it's happening and get more people to tune in who wouldn't otherwise
[00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.215]  No, you're right.
[00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:26.967]  On issues of Obamacare, gun restrictions, anything, we should, and we do write articles about it, but that boil it all down, but I think we posted an article this morning
[00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:33.491]  You know, basically titled, you know, 20 Reasons Why Obamacare is a Disaster.
[00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:35.632]  And I think that's a good article to go read.
[00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:39.896]  It's now scrolled off into the featured archive, but there's that red link that says Breaking.
[00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:41.177]  That's the RSS feed.
[00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:44.820]  Key to click on that red link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.762]  Just see everything that's been up there in that day.
[00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:52.827]  And there's also Top Story Archive, because there's so much that's going up there, it just scrolls off, scrolls off.
[00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:54.608]  But that's a great point.
[00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:55.328]  Thank you so much.
[00:04:55.668 --> 00:05:04.134]  Frank Serpico, a legendary police officer, whistleblower, is going to be with us to talk about his experiences with corruption and ways to turn it around.
[00:05:04.154 --> 00:05:07.376]  And we're going to have Wayne Madsen pop in briefly at the end.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.903]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:16.164 --> 00:05:20.926]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:28.090]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:32.253]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:34.094 --> 00:05:36.055]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:48.172 --> 00:05:50.053]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:51.813]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:54.674]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:59.055]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:01.255]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:03.836]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:04.316 --> 00:06:05.736]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:06.337]  Got it.
[00:06:06.677 --> 00:06:07.177]  Others don't.
[00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:13.978]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:16.439]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.182]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:25.584]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:28.946]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:30.627]  There's no priming required.
[00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.908]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:06:33.148 --> 00:06:35.629]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.051]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.531]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.513]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:45.974]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:47.975]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.177]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:52.918]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:54.379]  It's what my family uses.
[00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.860]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.503]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:12.719]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:13.660]  Number one.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.102]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:17.383 --> 00:07:17.943]  Number two.
[00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:22.787]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:23.567]  It's true.
[00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:28.431]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:29.291]  Number three.
[00:07:29.572 --> 00:07:32.854]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:36.837]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:37.557]  Number 4.
[00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:40.219]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.982]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:44.502]  Number 5.
[00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:49.005]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:53.989]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:58.296]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.019]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.303]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:04.847]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:17.990]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.452]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.694]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.754 --> 00:08:25.378]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:30.023]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.407 --> 00:08:38.108]  Eric Blair, a.k.a.
[00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:47.774]  George Orwell, wrote that in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:52.877]  And Frank Serpico is probably one of the most famous police officers in U.S.
[00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:53.838]  or world history.
[00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:58.861]  Of course, he's had big movies made about him with Al Pacino playing the part of Frank Serpico.
[00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:05.526]  And he joined us last year for a visit, and we've got him for about 45 minutes or so today.
[00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:11.512]  The last few minutes we're going to have an update on the secret wiretaps of Eric Holder being revealed.
[00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:19.039]  That story at the Hill crash, we were able to find a blog copy of it and posted it up at InfoWars.com if you want to read that.
[00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:22.001]  This is really coming to a head very, very quickly.
[00:09:23.102 --> 00:09:33.371]  With talk of the House going to the grand jury in the District of Columbia and calling for criminal charges, this is getting very Nixonian.
[00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:35.793]  And we'll talk about general corruption.
[00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:43.460]  You know, I wanted to get Frank Cerbico on about police corruption, what he witnessed in general society, because last time we talked mainly about his story.
[00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.262]  But there's so much happening.
[00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:49.725]  I just want to get his view overall on the state of the world today.
[00:09:50.816 --> 00:09:56.057]  He doesn't really need any introduction, but he joined the Newark Police Department in 59, a police officer for 12 years.
[00:09:56.477 --> 00:10:05.438]  His attempts to report police corruption to his superiors and the department fell on deaf ears until he was shot, but basically over to boil it all down.
[00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:13.620]  And then he moved to Switzerland for a while, and I could say a lot more about him, but best-selling books have been written about him, big blockbuster Hollywood films.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.300]  But he's a pretty humble guy.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.081]  Frank, good to have you back on with us today.
[00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:20.061]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:32.592]  Hi Alex, it's a pleasure and the first thing I want to do is apologize for the last show when my phone went bust and I found myself screaming into the wall phone there.
[00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.353]  So how's the transmission today?
[00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:39.458]  It is good sir, the transmission is super duper and it's good to have you.
[00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:40.138]  Frank,
[00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:47.993]  I want to ask you out of the gates, instead of asking questions, what is front and center on your radar screen right now?
[00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.094]  We haven't talked before this interview.
[00:10:50.914 --> 00:10:53.295]  What is front and center in your mind right now?
[00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:58.876]  Well, first of all, when you started the show, you mentioned the name Orwell?
[00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:01.596]  Yes, sir.
[00:11:02.217 --> 00:11:05.617]  Did you mean George Orwell, the guy who wrote 1984?
[00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:06.597]  Yes, sir.
[00:11:06.897 --> 00:11:08.958]  Okay, so we know where we're at, you know?
[00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:23.054]  And foremost on my mind is that you can't trust the government, you can't trust the media, and you can't trust the medical profession.
[00:11:23.074 --> 00:11:37.522]  I want to say, I mean, there are always exceptions to the rule, but, you know, what happens is you have these pundits, they get their degrees and they write their books, and they change history.
[00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:39.203]  They're revisionists.
[00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:47.073]  So you gotta be careful, you know, what you're reading, and who wrote it, and what their intention is.
[00:11:47.653 --> 00:12:08.804]  So, um, we were talking about Fast and Furious, and I was wondering how many of your listeners remember the Iran-Contra affair with Ali North and Israel, you know, delivering guns to Iran, and then also Israel
[00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:16.619]  Seeking an American, the USS Liberty, and then all kinds of cover-ups were written.
[00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:25.282]  They didn't know it was an American ship, but I heard one of the men on board saying he could see the pilots as they flew by.
[00:12:25.302 --> 00:12:38.006]  And the amazing thing is, is what this government allows others to get away with when they slaughter Americans and they claim to have our best interests at heart.
[00:12:38.823 --> 00:12:42.066]  So what I'm saying is, no, you can't trust the government.
[00:12:42.126 --> 00:12:46.511]  If they told me the sun was shining, I'd bring my umbrella out.
[00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:54.839]  You know, you make the parallel to Iran-Contra that's guns out of the country, drugs into the country.
[00:12:55.339 --> 00:13:00.764]  Now even the Washington Post is having a report on the fact that Fast and Furious has connections to narcotics.
[00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:07.829]  Came out in federal court, they were authorizing cartels to bring drugs in, that the feds are arming street gangs in the U.S.
[00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:12.131]  I mean, literally, Fast and Furious is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:20.316]  From your decades of studying this and living it, and I mean, your words last time, you said almost all the detectives around you were on the take or corrupt.
[00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:21.316]  I said, what was the percentage?
[00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:26.139]  You said, basically, all but I. What would you call this system?
[00:13:27.027 --> 00:13:28.668]  You said tip of the iceberg.
[00:13:29.248 --> 00:13:31.589]  I want to make that the tip of the dung heap.
[00:13:33.711 --> 00:13:43.796]  But like I say, I hear sometimes cops, they say to me, oh you're, it's just like if you speak up, they say you're anti-American.
[00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.797]  I say no, I'm just anti-corruption.
[00:13:46.237 --> 00:13:48.458]  I'm not anti-police, I'm anti-corruption.
[00:13:48.978 --> 00:13:54.401]  Just last week, a New York City police detective gave me
[00:13:55.382 --> 00:14:05.686]  His shield, his detective shield and his patrolman shield that was awarded to him by his narcotics squad when he retired.
[00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:11.589]  And I don't know how many of your listeners know about the Palladium murder.
[00:14:12.897 --> 00:14:25.850]  And the gentlemen that I'm speaking of and others that I will speak of, I say they are truly worthy of the title of New York's finest and the world's best detectives.
[00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:29.754]  But it seems there are, at a minimum,
[00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:38.311]  Or if they're not, their buddies are afraid to speak up because they will be made examples of.
[00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:47.600]  And in this case, the detective I'm speaking of, and your listeners can go online, his name is Bobby Adelarado.
[00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:53.946]  And he found that two men were charged with murder.
[00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:56.028]  They were even at the scene.
[00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:03.831]  And they served ten years and then two years more in a penitentiary.
[00:15:04.692 --> 00:15:07.675]  And he fought not to keep them in there.
[00:15:08.376 --> 00:15:09.577]  I have to get him out of there.
[00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:11.618]  And that's what he did.
[00:15:11.638 --> 00:15:14.399]  So there are good police out there.
[00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:23.664]  But the problem is that at the top, like with Bobby's case, he becomes the victim.
[00:15:24.285 --> 00:15:34.650]  And in cases that are going on in New York City today, that cops that are exposing these illegal search and seizures, where last year alone, 700
[00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:38.432]  We're good.
[00:16:08.115 --> 00:16:09.816]  An unlicensed dog.
[00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.657]  The guy said he doesn't even have a dog.
[00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:18.779]  You know, who's going to contest it when a cop gives you a ticket?
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.621]  What are you going to do, bring your dog to court?
[00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:29.224]  And, you know, so the system is broken and the men that want to speak out, they become the victims.
[00:16:29.324 --> 00:16:33.986]  And there's others, I don't want to talk too much about them because
[00:16:35.507 --> 00:16:38.891]  Only the worst will happen to him.
[00:16:55.563 --> 00:17:08.549]  Compared to the incredible corruption you saw in the New York Police Department, now with your sources, people that obviously come to you, is it worse today or how is the corruption different?
[00:17:11.178 --> 00:17:14.979]  Well, this is what I'm told by men in the street.
[00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:21.042]  The corruption is different in that cops don't want to be cops, and bosses don't want to be bosses.
[00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:22.862]  Nobody wants to take any chances.
[00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:24.643]  Nobody wants to stick their neck out.
[00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:27.684]  They just want to collect their paycheck and go home.
[00:17:28.244 --> 00:17:31.065]  True, in my day, they had what they called a pad.
[00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:39.428]  That was actually a pad with a list of all the numbers, runners, and the banks, and the dealers, you know, who paid off.
[00:17:39.729 --> 00:17:40.849]  And if you didn't pay off,
[00:17:41.668 --> 00:17:43.829]  Uh, you'd get arrested and sometimes worse.
[00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.270]  And, uh, intimidated.
[00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:54.855]  And if they found that you didn't have all your employees listed, I'm talking about the underworld, you would get fined.
[00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.996]  They ran it like a, like a business.
[00:17:57.876 --> 00:18:04.279]  Now, there are a lot of police that say, oh, come on, a cop would never do that, drugs, that's horrible.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.942]  And, but, what happened, to show you how the line is so thin,
[00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.179]  I started out in plain clothes.
[00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:14.800]  That was bison gambling.
[00:18:15.881 --> 00:18:21.046]  And you would get an envelope every month without doing anything.
[00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:22.728]  In fact, for doing nothing.
[00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:28.193]  For not arresting the people that were violating the law.
[00:18:29.312 --> 00:18:45.920]  So, the rule in the police department at the time was you had to serve four years in plainclothes, and then they said if you keep your nose clean, you will be automatically made a detective.
[00:18:46.881 --> 00:18:47.861]  So here's what happened.
[00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:52.364]  They had this expression, the grass eaters and the meat eaters.
[00:18:53.263 --> 00:18:56.045]  And the grass eaters were the ones that just grazed.
[00:18:56.685 --> 00:19:12.034]  You know, like, uh, they might take, uh, traffic money, or, uh, gambling money, or prostitution money, and they'd say, well, you know, that's, you know, that's just, uh, vices that people want anyway, but never touch that dirty drug money.
[00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:13.735]  So here's what happened.
[00:19:13.976 --> 00:19:15.997]  After four years of grazing,
[00:19:16.895 --> 00:19:21.838]  On a salary that a police officer isn't accustomed to.
[00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:25.720]  And these guys would hire yachts on the weekend.
[00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:30.223]  They would come to work, as in the case of a Dowd and a Dirty 30.
[00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:33.265]  They would sell guns, shields, narcotics.
[00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:40.209]  One guy sniffed cocaine off his cruiser, off his police car.
[00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.911]  And he would never have been caught
[00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:54.145]  If it wasn't for a sting operation by another agency in another county where he left the city limits to go and squeeze some more drug dealers.
[00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:58.912]  So this isn't something that was caught by the NYPD themselves.
[00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:07.228]  And what I'm saying is, after you get used to that lifestyle, for four years, all of a sudden, you're in narcotics.
[00:20:07.969 --> 00:20:11.513]  Now you think all of a sudden you're going to change your lifestyle?
[00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:20.223]  So now you've become the meat-eater, and the meat-eaters are bloodthirsty, carnivorous, and they'll do anything for a buck.
[00:20:21.957 --> 00:20:35.927]  And now our government is converting from being good old boy Boss Hogg, or what I would term a Boss Hogg is what you call a grass eater, to now just savage, out of control, eyes bugging out.
[00:20:35.947 --> 00:20:40.990]  Listen, I've been to New York quite a few times and I've seen people ask for directions who aren't from New York and be screamed at.
[00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:44.453]  Just the example of a corruption accelerating.
[00:20:45.373 --> 00:20:45.874]  And I've had
[00:20:46.434 --> 00:21:04.666]  I mean, I've seen videos of our reporters and in one case, Luke Rodowski was protesting out front building 7, talking about Larry Silverstein's involvement in 9-11, and the security guards come out looking like guys out of Goodfellas smoking pipes.
[00:21:05.407 --> 00:21:13.212]  You know, the classic thug with a pipe thinking he's a gentleman, and going with a cartoon gangster accent, going,
[00:21:14.349 --> 00:21:15.930]  You know what's going to happen?
[00:21:16.171 --> 00:21:19.373]  We're going to call the police and say your camera's a bomb.
[00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:21.555]  You're going to get charged with terrorism.
[00:21:21.836 --> 00:21:26.019]  And I know you're not a terrorist, but you're going to get 30 days in the hole.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.563]  The cops show up, the gangsters, literally out of central casting.
[00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:33.666]  If I was a Hollywood director, I would hire them for Sopranos.
[00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:39.991]  Then commands 20 police or so, who grab him and take his camera and say it's a gun and a bomb.
[00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:43.313]  I mean, listen, I have this on tape.
[00:21:43.713 --> 00:21:45.934]  They didn't even bother to erase the tape.
[00:21:46.334 --> 00:21:50.236]  They frame him on tape and don't even care and don't even erase the tape.
[00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:54.118]  That, to me, showed such incredible...
[00:21:55.063 --> 00:22:14.260]  It's such incredible hubris that they, and now I see footage that our correspondents shoot in New York, where the police walk around with cigarettes and cigars arresting ABC News reporters, there's footage of that online, with their hats on sideways.
[00:22:14.781 --> 00:22:17.123]  I mean, now it's becoming comical.
[00:22:17.943 --> 00:22:30.469]  And now I'm seeing in other parts of the country, take Seattle, where I saw articles, even in their local paper, where the police in some areas own half the bars because they will sell themselves drugs in the bathroom and then take the people's bars.
[00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:36.351]  So now they're not even shaking down criminals, which is the old excuse, as you know, for grazers or whatever.
[00:22:37.212 --> 00:22:39.653]  So they're becoming survival of the fittest.
[00:22:40.153 --> 00:22:43.294]  The bigger the meat eater, the more power they get.
[00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:46.556]  And so now what a meat eater would have been
[00:22:47.596 --> 00:22:49.338]  20 years ago is now a grazer.
[00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:50.198]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:22:50.218 --> 00:22:51.199]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.863]  There was one precinct commander.
[00:22:56.363 --> 00:23:04.410]  He even complained to this guy and said if it wasn't for that FN Sokoko, I would have been a millionaire today.
[00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:25.925]  So, it shows you the amount of money that's floating out there, and in the New York Times op-ed Monday, June 18th of this year, there's an article there called Policing by the Numbers, and it's written by a John Eterno, who is a retired New York City police captain.
[00:23:25.945 --> 00:23:32.170]  He's a professor of criminal justice and all that stuff, but he says,
[00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:47.057]  An officer assigned to an impact zone, a high crime area, told me that the Constitution, quote, the Constitution has been thrown out the window when it comes to stops.
[00:23:47.638 --> 00:23:53.483]  He is given strict daily quotas and asked at the end of his tour about his numbers.
[00:23:54.003 --> 00:23:57.026]  An officer who fails to meet the required number
[00:23:57.866 --> 00:24:07.073]  For the day is berated sometimes in front of peers, not allowed time off, and given unpalatable work assignments.
[00:24:07.594 --> 00:24:15.319]  Nothing is asked about maintaining order, interacting with the community, or other kinds of police works.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.582]  The result of this performance culture
[00:24:19.764 --> 00:24:35.996]  Needless summonses for minor violations, putting one's feet on the subway seats, playing chess in a park, failing to wear a seatbelt, another quota-driven activity, this does not make for efficient policing, etc.
[00:24:36.797 --> 00:24:39.299]  So, that's where it is today.
[00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:48.246]  Another police officer said to me, our cop today is nothing more than an armed tax collector.
[00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:59.588]  I mean, these people who have legitimate permits, these vendors on the street trying to make a living, they're given fines at times up to $1,000.
[00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:03.432]  How are they ever going to pay these fines?
[00:25:04.427 --> 00:25:13.253]  And the crazy thing is, if you go out of the city, you can make a turn, you can make a right turn on a red light, when it's safe.
[00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:18.016]  In the city, you try that, and the ticket is like $100.
[00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:23.660]  They tow your cars away, it's just... Now listen, I've talked to people that I've known for like 16 years.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.382]  He owned a couple dump trucks, made a decent living.
[00:25:27.162 --> 00:25:29.785]  Now he's just out of business because of the fines and fees.
[00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:35.070]  They'll even pull a new truck over and say there's dirt on the bumper here in Austin and the cops just don't care.
[00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:36.992]  People are going bankrupt.
[00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:41.497]  Only big companies can come in and then pass on the expenses to people that hire them.
[00:25:41.878 --> 00:25:44.681]  It's destroying the economy and the government loves it.
[00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:45.481]  They love it.
[00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:47.704]  I mean, they're going to kill this country.
[00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:49.141]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:49.602 --> 00:25:54.805]  This guy goes on to say, policing in a democracy is not easy, nor is it meant to be.
[00:25:54.825 --> 00:26:04.973]  Reducing crime numbers is simple if you disregard basic rights, ignore victims, mandate quotas, and manipulate numbers.
[00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:23.896]  The lunacy of this policy performance culture can end only with stranger leadership, greater transparency, uh, stronger leadership that is, uh, which would be strange, uh, greater transparency and more meaningful relationships with the community.
[00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:32.578]  And then it says it is worth heeding what Detective Frank Serpico testified on police corruption told the Knapp Commission in 1971.
[00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:46.461]  Quote, the department must realize that an effective, continuing relationship between the police and the public is more important than an impressive arrest record.
[00:26:48.247 --> 00:26:51.489]  Uh, and that's what I became a cop for.
[00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.031]  Frank, where is it all going?
[00:26:53.531 --> 00:26:54.472]  Where is it all going?
[00:26:54.512 --> 00:27:14.826]  Because you're in one jurisdiction, and the police are changing flat tires, helping people, actually going after bad guys, but that's more and more rare, and you go in another jurisdiction, I don't care if it's in the South, the North, the West, and the police are crazed, wild-eyed thugs, who instinctively, I can just, by their bearing, automatically tell her the enemy of
[00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:21.588]  Well, it's not going good if it's not stopped because this kind of activity doesn't happen if it's not condoned at the top.
[00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:44.426]  For example, the commissioner in New York in charge of press relations, he commented about me.
[00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:51.229]  He says my comments are born out of ignorance from being away for 40 years.
[00:27:52.069 --> 00:27:54.731]  And my response to him is, well, what's his excuse?
[00:27:55.212 --> 00:28:05.960]  Doesn't he watch and see, you know, all these videos that are being taken by independent people of harassment and... Well, that's my question.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:13.126]  How could police walk up on a video and say, we're going to say your camera is a gun and a bomb,
[00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:19.268]  And then frame someone on tape and not even care to erase the tape.
[00:28:19.308 --> 00:28:26.439]  I mean, this confidence says they're going to get promoted for stomping on somebody's rights and setting them up.
[00:28:27.386 --> 00:28:46.673]  Well, I don't know if you know the case of Adrian Schoolcraft, a police officer who refused to go along and they broke into his house that night, handcuffed him behind his back and took him to the psycho ward where he was handcuffed to a gurney for six days.
[00:28:47.554 --> 00:28:54.256]  And then you read the police blog and nobody wants to believe it because you can't just psycho a guy with, you know,
[00:28:57.341 --> 00:29:05.207]  But if it's the mayor and the police commissioner who's behind it, then, you know, who's gonna say no?
[00:29:06.148 --> 00:29:19.138]  And so it's really terrible, and what amazes me is that the people aren't up in arms as they did in Egypt.
[00:29:19.218 --> 00:29:24.822]  You know, you'd think the people would have had enough and say no more, but
[00:29:26.388 --> 00:29:27.440]  Somehow, um...
[00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:49.939]  I'm sure you're familiar with young Marcus Tullius Cicero, who back in, it was 70 years before the birth of Christ and the Roman Republic, the foremost power of its day had reached its venus, and its leadership had attained unbound wealth and unstinted power.
[00:29:49.959 --> 00:29:56.582]  The rulers were intolerant of restraint, indifferent to demands... I'll tell you what, Frank Serpico, stay there, gotta go to break, come back with a quote.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.250]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.173 --> 00:30:04.862]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:18.113 --> 00:33:20.274]  Well, that's perfect timing.
[00:33:20.494 --> 00:33:23.496]  I was talking to Frank Serpico, and I said, you know, what's the bottom line?
[00:33:23.536 --> 00:33:26.798]  And he said, he said, it's mind control.
[00:33:27.198 --> 00:33:28.579]  And then that bumper plays.
[00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:32.161]  Frank, repeat what you were saying off air.
[00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:36.183]  I mean, on all those issues, you were saying, well, your show says it all.
[00:33:36.564 --> 00:33:37.624]  War on for your mind.
[00:33:37.684 --> 00:33:38.485]  What's going on here?
[00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:42.823]  Well, the human race has been torn to the highest bidder.
[00:33:43.963 --> 00:33:53.426]  I mean, it amazes me that these young kids kowtow to all these, you know, the Pope, the Queen, the media, the government.
[00:33:53.786 --> 00:33:56.827]  You know, the Queen, who is one of the
[00:33:57.747 --> 00:34:00.569]  Uh, whatever she is, she's certainly not a princess.
[00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.452]  You know, the queen bee with the bees works more than the rest of the workers.
[00:34:06.153 --> 00:34:13.718]  Uh, these people who have exploited the world and races, uh, that people should curtsy to them?
[00:34:13.738 --> 00:34:16.160]  I mean, it is mind-boggling.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.024]  It's insane that they think that they're better than the rest of the human race.
[00:34:22.424 --> 00:34:27.207]  I mean, you know what I'm talking about, where, you know, if you're with the prince or you're with them, you have to curtsy.
[00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:30.630]  See, my God, I mean, when are the people going to wake up?
[00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.213]  You know, they're being held prisoners in their own minds.
[00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:36.816]  You're absolutely right.
[00:34:37.296 --> 00:34:50.007]  And then, you know, I get a letter from the NAACP, of which I'm a member, and, uh, you know, I believe in equality and justice, that they say, Frank, taking a stand for what is right sometimes comes with grave consequences.
[00:34:50.308 --> 00:34:51.329]  Yes, that's true.
[00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:55.872]  And then they go, since taking office as United Attorney General, what?
[00:34:56.333 --> 00:35:00.036]  And they're saying, sadly, extreme elements within the U.S.
[00:35:00.116 --> 00:35:03.399]  House are threatening the Attorney General.
[00:35:03.749 --> 00:35:09.833]  I mean, this, what's happening, there are no principles.
[00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:12.494]  It should be principles above personality.
[00:35:13.014 --> 00:35:27.483]  And it's all this cronyism, and I wish these young kids today, they would wake up and, well, you remember what happened at Kent State when the National Guard opened fire on its own citizens.
[00:35:27.863 --> 00:35:29.244]  Maybe that's what they're afraid of.
[00:35:30.384 --> 00:35:32.705]  Well, let me raise that because it's funny you brought that up.
[00:35:32.745 --> 00:35:34.885]  They're announcing more and more military on the streets.
[00:35:35.345 --> 00:35:38.106]  Secretary of the Army wants to station a brigade in every city.
[00:35:38.606 --> 00:35:39.786]  It's not for Al-Qaeda now.
[00:35:40.226 --> 00:35:42.827]  They're little buddies they're using over in Libya and Syria.
[00:35:42.847 --> 00:35:43.467]  It's for us.
[00:35:44.067 --> 00:35:45.607]  They're announcing armed drones.
[00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:50.548]  They're announcing 450 million rounds of .40 cal hollow point for citizens.
[00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:54.789]  Homeland Security is getting mobile armored pillboxes.
[00:35:55.529 --> 00:35:58.630]  What do you think this whole buildup is for, Serpico?
[00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:03.734]  Well, uh, if it's, uh, the way it's happening, it's not for the good.
[00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.394]  It's to suppress the masses.
[00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:11.038]  Uh, we got another, uh, um, uh, Syria.
[00:36:11.178 --> 00:36:14.480]  Uh, you know, it's gonna be, uh, uh, the U.S.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:32.599]  They say the United States, but the people have to get united against oppression is what they have to do, and this is what the government is afraid of, so they're going to, you know, control the people by force of arms.
[00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:37.533]  You know, I mean, I live in a country.
[00:36:37.553 --> 00:36:47.699]  I mean, you know what they say, I can spin a buck, I could run a trout line, and a country boy can survive, you know?
[00:36:48.379 --> 00:36:50.561]  And the people are arming up!
[00:36:51.702 --> 00:36:53.244]  They don't trust the government, though.
[00:36:54.265 --> 00:36:56.889]  You know, it's not just a few.
[00:36:56.909 --> 00:36:58.951]  It's those that are awake.
[00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:06.601]  And, you know, are they going to say that I'm, you know, I'm talking, you know, accuse me of trying to incite the masses?
[00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.952]  You don't know what this government is capable of.
[00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:17.254]  And let me tell you, you know, you were saying I was in Switzerland.
[00:37:17.614 --> 00:37:19.055]  You know why I left Switzerland?
[00:37:19.095 --> 00:37:27.300]  Because I was run out by the FBI because they wanted me to come back to New York and be a part of their sham.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.841]  And I refused.
[00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:34.564]  And they sent out a subpoena and said I would be held in contempt if I refused.
[00:37:35.184 --> 00:37:38.866]  And so I had to take it on the lam out of Switzerland.
[00:37:40.507 --> 00:37:43.811]  But again, you have one country, you have another country.
[00:37:43.931 --> 00:38:00.769]  I ended up in Holland, and I ended up pulling a little kid out of the canal that had fallen into the canal, and a crowd, you know, assembled, and then the police, and I snuck out through the crowd before the police got there.
[00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:02.751]  Then a couple of nights later,
[00:38:03.813 --> 00:38:10.157]  Uh, there was a burglary in progress across the canal because I was living on the canal and I had my dog with me and he was barking.
[00:38:10.237 --> 00:38:29.910]  I looked and, uh, call it muscle memory or reflex, I called the police and then I went out there and they, they had the, um, uh, the guy, uh, and, uh, with all the booty, he took off the boat and I was really impressed by the way that he, uh, was handled by the police.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.563]  And the next morning, two detectives came to my door and escorted me to police headquarters.
[00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:49.590]  And they brought me through the cells, and I thought, oh, they're gonna throw me in the flamma, but at least I thought, look at this, you can eat off the floor here, stainless steel, and it was civil, not like the dungeons they have in New York and other places.
[00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:54.273]  And then, they didn't throw me in there, they brought me upstairs to the police commissioner,
[00:38:55.015 --> 00:39:05.945]  And the commissioner, a gray-haired gentleman, he jumped to his feet, he reached out his hand and he said, Maneer, sir, may I shake your hand?
[00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:07.026]  And I thought, what?
[00:39:07.726 --> 00:39:08.907]  Am I dreaming or something?
[00:39:09.288 --> 00:39:18.436]  He had a copy of his book on my desk, on his desk, and I said, it's always a pleasure to shake the hand of a police officer that wants to shake my hand.
[00:39:19.276 --> 00:39:20.938]  And that's what I wrote in his book.
[00:39:21.613 --> 00:39:41.179]  And a couple years ago, when I was involved with the drug wars, the damage done, the drug wars, and it was premiering in Amsterdam, the police commissioner, the new police commissioner, came to introduce me, and he said, in 1974,
[00:39:43.943 --> 00:39:50.985]  I had to choose between becoming, uh, an F-16 pilot or the Sports Academy.
[00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:56.047]  And he says, and then I saw a movie called Surfico, and my mind was made up.
[00:39:57.007 --> 00:40:01.748]  So, my point is, what we have to do, we have to inspire people.
[00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:08.430]  Uh, because by our deeds, they're like pebbles that you throw into a body of water, they make ripples.
[00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.191]  And I never would have imagined that
[00:40:11.946 --> 00:40:20.412]  You know, 30, 40 years after, people are still being inspired, and that's what the people need.
[00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:22.133]  They need inspiration.
[00:40:22.293 --> 00:40:26.576]  Well, like your show that, you know, tells people what's really going on in the world.
[00:40:27.196 --> 00:40:29.918]  And, um, but, uh, you know,
[00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:32.501]  I know they play with words.
[00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:35.225]  They got their own vocabulary.
[00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:36.908]  They say freedom isn't free.
[00:40:37.228 --> 00:40:38.710]  You bet your ass it isn't free.
[00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.815]  You have to fight for it, but not in foreign countries.
[00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:45.841]  Right here in our own country, that's where you have to fight for your freedom.
[00:40:47.256 --> 00:40:50.220]  Wow, Frank Serpico, this is an amazing interview.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.582]  You are definitely on fire today.
[00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:53.764]  We're going to do overdrive, folks.
[00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:54.985]  We can finish the hour with him.
[00:40:55.446 --> 00:40:59.250]  We're just going to go into the fourth hour with Wayne Madsen coming up, if he's able to do that.
[00:41:00.031 --> 00:41:03.295]  He's got the inside scoop on Fast and Furious, murders, all of it.
[00:41:03.896 --> 00:41:04.677]  Former NSA
[00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:06.278]  I don't
[00:41:29.594 --> 00:41:29.814]  I don't
[00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:47.154]  And others.
[00:41:47.514 --> 00:41:48.696]  And that's what you've got to do.
[00:41:48.896 --> 00:41:52.139]  All of us doing little things, like the pebbles in a pond.
[00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:56.523]  But you can feel the evil intensifying right now.
[00:41:56.563 --> 00:41:58.985]  You can see the insane corruption.
[00:41:59.025 --> 00:42:02.188]  Frank, let me raise a curveball on you here.
[00:42:03.049 --> 00:42:05.151]  Because, you know, we didn't talk before you came on today.
[00:42:05.171 --> 00:42:06.672]  What about 9-11?
[00:42:06.852 --> 00:42:11.476]  It's been used as the foundation of everything that we see happening.
[00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:19.903]  The warrantless spying that's illegal, the highway checkpoints all over the country, the TSA sticking their hands down our pants.
[00:42:19.923 --> 00:42:20.943]  I want to ask you about that.
[00:42:21.784 --> 00:42:22.024]  I don't
[00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:43.491]  But the official story of 9-11, now Amr al-Awlaki, number three in al-Qaeda, they admit was really CIA.
[00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:46.832]  The head of the 7-7 bombings, they admit was MI6.
[00:42:47.332 --> 00:42:53.613]  Now they publicly use al-Qaeda to take over Libya and now Syria, and they admit this in the news.
[00:42:53.693 --> 00:42:56.894]  Well, yeah, al-Qaeda is working for us, but they're good guys.
[00:42:57.434 --> 00:42:59.915]  But I've got to have TSA grope my family.
[00:43:00.555 --> 00:43:04.280]  And William Shatner's got to have him pull his pants down, because they're going in his pants.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.522]  I mean, that's what they did.
[00:43:05.542 --> 00:43:06.483]  They went in his pants.
[00:43:06.523 --> 00:43:07.244]  They fell off.
[00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.566]  It happens all the time to people.
[00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:10.749]  Make old ladies get out of wheelchairs.
[00:43:10.769 --> 00:43:12.230]  I mean, I'm ranting here, Serpico.
[00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:16.096]  But this foundation of 9-11, what's your view on that?
[00:43:16.732 --> 00:43:31.785]  First of all, you know, I refused to fly because when I came back in the country, I was strip searched by the customs people and they knew everything that was going on in my life with the police, which was supposed to be secret.
[00:43:32.265 --> 00:43:35.348]  So, but I have to say one thing that
[00:43:36.428 --> 00:43:41.833]  The thing is, it's the hierarchy that forces these men to do it, like they're quotas.
[00:43:42.213 --> 00:43:51.901]  And these guys, as they said to me, you know, Frank, I mean, it might be rationalizing, but they say, you know, we got our jobs, our home, we have to pay the mortgage.
[00:43:52.561 --> 00:43:57.482]  So there are the victims, but they just have to be strong enough.
[00:43:57.923 --> 00:44:00.483]  But how are you going to do it when they hold the axe over you?
[00:44:00.863 --> 00:44:06.485]  I wrote an article about 9-11 for Chronogram magazine way back when.
[00:44:06.545 --> 00:44:13.007]  I don't remember all the names and stuff now, but about the Iron Triangle, and that the night before 9-11,
[00:44:15.027 --> 00:44:26.634]  You know, Bin Laden's, I think it was his brother, and all these heads of state had this meeting at, I forget which hotel it was here in America.
[00:44:26.774 --> 00:44:28.115]  It was the Ritz Carlton.
[00:44:28.155 --> 00:44:29.395]  The Ritz Carlton.
[00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:31.416]  Yeah, that was in the London Guardian.
[00:44:31.957 --> 00:44:38.500]  Yeah, Bush and all the Bin Ladens and then only they were allowed to leave the country on the day of 9-11 when all the air traffic was shut down.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.441]  That's confirmed, yes.
[00:44:39.501 --> 00:44:41.222]  Yeah, so wasn't that a coincidence?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.001]  No, I mean, they blew it sky high.
[00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:46.621]  It's a fact.
[00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:58.505]  And then this other character, Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani, you know, there still is hope for democracy in America.
[00:44:58.545 --> 00:45:06.548]  I gotta say that because there's this street artist and his name has no relation to the show host.
[00:45:06.648 --> 00:45:08.108]  I think it gave something
[00:45:10.985 --> 00:45:24.068]  Robert Letterman or something, but anyway, he was a street artist and he would make paintings of Giuliani and he would call him Adolf Giuliani with a mustache and things like that.
[00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:28.810]  Giuliani, the mayor of New York, had him arrested 41 times.
[00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:40.217]  And this street artist managed to beat him every time, so there are some good judges out there, and they have to inspire the others.
[00:45:40.277 --> 00:45:49.303]  We have to, you know, there was a quote I was looking for here from Cicero, you know, about diligence.
[00:45:52.242 --> 00:45:56.088]  You're talking about the heights of the Roman Empire, you were building it up and we had to go to break.
[00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:56.929]  Right, right.
[00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.733]  I lost the quote, but...
[00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:10.872]  In the end, he says, and who shall say we are worthy of more?
[00:46:11.512 --> 00:46:18.876]  So, you know, you can't blame nobody if you sit on your laurels and you don't do anything about it.
[00:46:20.136 --> 00:46:28.961]  So the people, their strength in numbers, he says, though liberty is established by law, we must be vigilant.
[00:46:29.681 --> 00:46:35.724]  For liberty to enslave us is always present under that very liberty.
[00:46:36.639 --> 00:46:41.121]  Our Constitution speaks of the general welfare of the people.
[00:46:42.081 --> 00:46:51.384]  Under that phrase, all sorts of excesses can be employed by lusting tyrants to make us bondsmen.
[00:46:52.384 --> 00:46:55.285]  So, that doesn't say it all.
[00:46:56.886 --> 00:46:58.507]  I don't know what does.
[00:47:04.324 --> 00:47:12.760]  I don't know how much time we have, but it's always a pleasure talking to you and visiting
[00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:19.686]  Your website, uh, about our great Pope and all the work he did.
[00:47:19.726 --> 00:47:23.347]  And, uh, you know, that's the opiate of the masses.
[00:47:23.667 --> 00:47:36.230]  Uh, you know, as I said before, you know, the Pope, the Queen, uh, you know, these, uh, rock stars, uh, uh, they, uh, the, the labels inside your, your clothes.
[00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:42.511]  You know, it's, um, the corporations that, uh, make porn out of the public.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:58.844]  And, um, you know, telling you, uh, then you, then you see these guys, uh, these, uh, uh, television guys are on public television and, uh, with a brand new suit every time and, and the commissioner, too, in New York City.
[00:47:58.924 --> 00:48:01.384]  Thousand dollar suits, hundred dollar ties.
[00:48:01.404 --> 00:48:07.946]  You know, they're setting a good example for, um, uh, you know, tightening your belt.
[00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:10.569]  What do you think about Eric Holder?
[00:48:10.709 --> 00:48:16.756]  From my research, he was intimately involved in Oklahoma City and in the cover-up, and it's in federal court.
[00:48:16.776 --> 00:48:23.503]  It was even in the Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times that the drug cartels, Sinaloa got caught with five tons.
[00:48:24.184 --> 00:48:27.566]  They're in court, and the feds come in and go, yeah, it's national security.
[00:48:28.707 --> 00:48:30.488]  We authorize them to bring the drugs in.
[00:48:30.928 --> 00:48:38.813]  And then it happened with a bunch of other cartels, and then we found out that they're giving guns to gangs all over the U.S., but also overseas.
[00:48:39.433 --> 00:48:42.395]  I mean, it's just, they are nothing but total gangsters.
[00:48:43.655 --> 00:48:47.278]  You're talking about the government, exactly.
[00:48:47.418 --> 00:48:48.238]  The thing is,
[00:48:52.410 --> 00:49:02.816]  We never would have even probably heard about what happened in Mexico if it wasn't for the killing of the federal agent.
[00:49:03.257 --> 00:49:10.521]  You know, they say nothing of the 200 other Mexicans that were slaughtered.
[00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:18.126]  So, you know, body count doesn't mean anything to people that are running the show.
[00:49:18.146 --> 00:49:19.647]  You know, it's collateral damage.
[00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:36.274]  So that's why, you know, the NAACP says here in their letter too, however, it says the NAACP supports accountability and transparency at every level.
[00:49:36.374 --> 00:49:36.694]  Fine.
[00:49:37.354 --> 00:49:42.777]  But they say, however, this crusade in Congress reeks of partisan politics.
[00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:46.027]  Well, I want to say, what does this letter reek of, you know?
[00:49:46.107 --> 00:49:59.843]  And so everybody's using words, it's cronyism, and I say let the chips fall where they may, and what we find, as I said before, is just the tip of the dung heap.
[00:50:00.114 --> 00:50:00.614]  No, you're right.
[00:50:00.674 --> 00:50:02.135]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:50:02.196 --> 00:50:05.698]  I found a Cicero quote from BC here.
[00:50:05.738 --> 00:50:17.267]  It says, when a government becomes powerful, period, it is a usurper which takes bread from the innocent mouths and deprives honorable men of their substance for votes.
[00:50:18.624 --> 00:50:24.190]  With which to perpetuate itself and because the Romans did the same thing with citizens.
[00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:34.660]  They would go buy votes, they would take it with welfare taxes and then go to the welfare citizens on the dole and use them to outvote other people that produced.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.722]  I mean this stuff's been going on forever.
[00:50:37.532 --> 00:50:44.781]  Yeah, well, now with the internet and stuff, maybe people can, you know, inform each other better.
[00:50:44.801 --> 00:50:57.656]  You know, the other day I went on and I saw something about Kissinger, and I don't know if it was real or not, but I wanted to say something about, you know, Kissinger, one of the biggest war criminals
[00:50:57.936 --> 00:50:59.437]  Tell you what, we're going to break.
[00:50:59.517 --> 00:51:00.238]  Final segment.
[00:51:00.278 --> 00:51:01.438]  Frank Serpico, our guest.
[00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:06.081]  Then Wayne Madsen is coming up with breaking news on Fast and Furious and so much more.
[00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:06.742]  Frank, stay there.
[00:51:06.762 --> 00:51:07.442]  Final segment.
[00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:08.723]  You're a real champ.
[00:51:08.943 --> 00:51:13.045]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:51:13.726 --> 00:51:15.867]  I want you to know some very important information.

[00:53:07.797 --> 00:53:10.700]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors in every relationship.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.263]  And one of the biggest is that men are losing libido, or sexual desire.
[00:53:14.443 --> 00:53:15.964]  Especially if you're a man over 40.
[00:53:16.144 --> 00:53:18.506]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.
[00:53:18.726 --> 00:53:21.829]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every way.
[00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:23.410]  That's why we created T-Gen.

[00:53:28.254 --> 00:53:32.578]  Optimum testosterone levels mean better mood, energy, and of course, better sex life.

[00:54:19.039 --> 00:54:29.582]  All right, I'm going into the fourth hour.
[00:54:29.622 --> 00:54:33.664]  Some stations carry it, some don't, but I'm gonna be talking to Dean, Mello, Jake.
[00:54:34.344 --> 00:54:37.405]  Quentin and others that have been patiently holding Dean listing on XM 166.
[00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:39.125]  We're going to him first.
[00:54:39.145 --> 00:54:41.826]  Got about four or five minutes left with Frank Serpico.
[00:54:41.866 --> 00:54:42.526]  What a legend.
[00:54:42.966 --> 00:54:45.227]  Like he said, we've got to inspire other people.
[00:54:45.627 --> 00:54:48.828]  And he gave the examples of how he inspired people and never knew he was doing it.
[00:54:49.308 --> 00:54:50.929]  I know he certainly inspired me.
[00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:52.649]  I was growing up as a child.
[00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:53.729]  I'm only 38.
[00:54:53.849 --> 00:54:56.410]  I was probably like 12 years old or something.
[00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.291]  My dad, you know,
[00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:04.192]  Went and rented Serpico and popped it in the VCR or it was on...
[00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.511]  I don't know, HBO or something.
[00:55:06.591 --> 00:55:07.071]  I don't remember.
[00:55:07.091 --> 00:55:08.892]  I don't think we had cable when I was 12.
[00:55:08.932 --> 00:55:12.935]  The point is I remember being a little kid with my dad watching it and my dad going, this is a true story.
[00:55:13.455 --> 00:55:22.722]  And then I started noticing a few years later that the police were dealing drugs where I lived, outside Dallas, and then still pulling people over and harassing them.
[00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:24.803]  And I'd be like, you deal drugs.
[00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:26.264]  What are you doing asking if I have drugs?
[00:55:26.304 --> 00:55:27.145]  I don't use drugs.
[00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:28.626]  I'll kill you, kid.
[00:55:28.646 --> 00:55:29.626]  You're going to jail.
[00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:34.790]  You know, drag me out of the car where I was riding to school with older kids and take me to jail.
[00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:42.178]  And I told my dad through our lawyer because he got contacted and they said we're gonna kill your son if he doesn't shut up.
[00:55:42.898 --> 00:55:49.406]  But then later the sheriff got busted shipping cocaine in by the FBI, who are a bunch of drug dealers too at the top.
[00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:52.869]  Frank, briefly, you wanted to make some comments.
[00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.512]  I forget about what we were talking during the break.
[00:55:55.773 --> 00:55:56.233]  What was that?
[00:55:57.094 --> 00:55:58.214]  Oh yeah, Kissinger, go ahead.
[00:55:58.554 --> 00:56:09.337]  I mean, it's just a classic example how these, you know, terrible people are held up by our government as good people, you know, as examples.
[00:56:10.157 --> 00:56:20.739]  The other day, I don't know how old it was on the internet, some journalist claimed he saw Kissinger being groped, you know.
[00:56:20.939 --> 00:56:22.240]  No, no, no, Kissinger admitted it.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.360]  That happened at the airport, yeah.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:33.111]  Yeah, well, the thing is, I was saying, well, they had a right to, uh, maybe, uh, he did have a weapon of mass destruction on him, you know, because he is a terrorist.
[00:56:33.751 --> 00:56:37.335]  But, anyway, when I went to see the blog, I was, uh,
[00:56:38.897 --> 00:56:43.501]  I'm pleased to see all the comments that the people were making back and forth.
[00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:53.449]  You know, the people know that he was a war criminal, you know, and one said winning the Nobel Prize is not hard when you are one of the founding members.
[00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:55.249]  We're good to go.
[00:57:21.175 --> 00:57:23.638]  And that's what we're in now, continual warfare.
[00:57:24.279 --> 00:57:27.844]  And how much time do we have?
[00:57:27.884 --> 00:57:38.779]  Because I'd like to close with the words of Lewis B. Brandes, who was a secular humanist, and I think, wasn't he also on the court?
[00:57:39.774 --> 00:57:41.818]  Um, Louis Brandeis?
[00:57:42.018 --> 00:57:43.200]  Sure, go ahead, we've got about a minute.
[00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:50.852]  He says we can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth in the hands of a few.
[00:57:51.894 --> 00:57:53.457]  But we can't have both.
[00:57:56.004 --> 00:58:00.987]  Well, Frank Serbico, thanks to you standing up for what's right.
[00:58:01.787 --> 00:58:06.310]  We now know, I mean, back when you first stood up, people were like, oh, there's no such thing as cops stealing drugs.
[00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:09.092]  In the fifties, they said Lacosa Nostra didn't exist.
[00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:13.954]  Our naivete is what has allowed us to become this enslaved and are in action.
[00:58:14.295 --> 00:58:17.757]  But thank you for helping pull back some very dangerous veils.
[00:58:18.317 --> 00:58:19.678]  And I want you to have a great weekend.
[00:58:19.698 --> 00:58:21.699]  I look forward to maybe in six months or so.
[00:58:22.159 --> 00:58:23.720]  Okay, and thanks for having me.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.500]  Oh, thank you.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.341]  And letting me say my piece.
[00:58:26.761 --> 00:58:29.723]  And thank you for visiting our news website, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:30.103 --> 00:58:34.125]  Let me say bye to you right here at the end of this segment, Frank.
[00:58:34.145 --> 00:58:34.905]  We'll put you on hold.
[00:58:35.246 --> 00:58:37.347]  Wow, there goes Frank Serpico.

[01:00:17.971 --> 01:00:22.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:43.033]  Okay, my friends, Jesse Ventura is scheduled to be coming up.
[01:00:43.053 --> 01:00:44.215]  We'll call him in about two minutes.
[01:00:45.116 --> 01:00:48.539]  We've got Billy Corrigan coming up with a bombshell interview I taped this weekend.
[01:00:48.639 --> 01:00:50.521]  Believe me when I say bombshell, it's bombshell.
[01:00:51.342 --> 01:00:56.447]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian, who's a TSA worker, I guess current or former.
[01:00:56.668 --> 01:00:57.128]  Let us know.
[01:00:57.188 --> 01:00:57.909]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:01:01.394 --> 01:01:09.361]  Well, tell us, I mean, the whistleblower we had yesterday said that he's involved in hiring and they now, this is a new policy, they want criminals.
[01:01:09.661 --> 01:01:10.762]  Have you heard anything like this?
[01:01:10.782 --> 01:01:15.466]  Yeah, I've heard a lot of things like that, but I just want to vouch for what the last caller said.
[01:01:16.067 --> 01:01:17.088]  I totally agree with that.
[01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:22.132]  But also, a lot of my fellow workers, they also, like, it's gonna sound sick, but they also play games, like,
[01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:25.130]  Let's see how much we can get away with, you know what I mean?
[01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:26.071]  Like, how much can we touch?
[01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:32.096]  I don't do that, but I hear a lot of other workers basically playing those sick games, and it's very, very sick.
[01:01:33.297 --> 01:01:39.162]  Why would someone want to spill somebody's dead grandpa's ashes on the ground and then laugh at them?
[01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:40.664]  I mean, I just don't understand that.
[01:01:42.505 --> 01:01:44.467]  You know, people are sick.
[01:01:44.487 --> 01:01:49.291]  This country is going to crap, and like I said, TSA just hires the most
[01:01:50.066 --> 01:01:52.348]  Disgusting, most evil people they can find.
[01:01:52.388 --> 01:01:54.189]  You just hit the nail on the head.
[01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.453]  It's not just the police or the TSA or any of this.
[01:01:58.813 --> 01:02:00.594]  As a culture, it's getting very sick.
[01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:03.256]  Now, have you heard anything about hiring criminals?
[01:02:05.979 --> 01:02:11.643]  I don't know anything specifically, but I do know like a lot of people I've talked to do have criminal backgrounds.
[01:02:12.304 --> 01:02:19.069]  And also, a lot of like, for instance, a lot of slips are placed in the bag saying that the TSA checked your bag, and if something's missing,
[01:02:19.505 --> 01:02:26.070]  They're deliberately going and taking these items, taking these, you know, personal belongings, you know, because, like I said, it's kind of a game to them.
[01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:32.254]  Well, we've seen that, where they either leave marijuana in and say, enjoy your weed, or they take stuff.
[01:02:32.294 --> 01:02:35.717]  They stole a baby rattle, or a teething ring, at JFK.
[01:02:35.737 --> 01:02:37.498]  It was for my daughter, in a little box.
[01:02:37.538 --> 01:02:44.884]  They unwrapped it, stole it, didn't like the other rattle, left it, thought that, I mean, just, just, and that was like six years ago, seven years ago.
[01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:47.295]  What else can you tell us?
[01:02:47.775 --> 01:02:56.238]  So you're saying you work at an airport with TSA, currently, your TSA to be clear, and there are people bragging that they have criminal records that work there.
[01:02:57.218 --> 01:02:57.418]  Yes.
[01:02:58.479 --> 01:02:59.699]  What type of criminal records?
[01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:03.760]  Um, robbery, um, theft.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:13.983]  Um, I don't know of any people personally that have, uh, I guess, you know, child, uh, abuse or anything like that kind of nature, but a lot of them
[01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:17.644]  Just by talking to them, you'd be able to tell that they are pretty much criminals.
[01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:20.667]  Well, I mean, that's what criminals do.
[01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:22.809]  They brag that, hey, I've been in jail.
[01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:23.750]  Hey, I've done this.
[01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:24.691]  Hey, I've done that.
[01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.153]  So you're saying you'll be what, sitting around?
[01:03:27.434 --> 01:03:32.719]  Give us an example, like sitting around the break room and they talk about how they're convicted robbers?
[01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:33.360]  Or what do they say?
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.500]  Pretty much stuff like that.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.461]  It's disgusting.
[01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.302]  I'm telling you, the games that they like to play.
[01:03:39.322 --> 01:03:43.264]  Let's see how far we can touch this person before they complain.
[01:03:43.284 --> 01:03:47.166]  Let's see how far we can get with this little kid.
[01:03:47.566 --> 01:03:52.368]  Just completely disgusting, evil, demonic.
[01:03:53.885 --> 01:03:54.365]  You name it.
[01:03:54.385 --> 01:03:56.347]  Well, that's what the whistleblower said yesterday.
[01:03:56.407 --> 01:03:58.508]  He said now they're outside the checkpoint.
[01:03:58.769 --> 01:04:03.532]  There was a mother with two kids and he goes, watch this, I'm going to go mess with her and went and searched her belongings.
[01:04:03.832 --> 01:04:05.313]  What about good looking women?
[01:04:05.614 --> 01:04:09.677]  I have seen what you'd call a hottie over and over again.
[01:04:09.697 --> 01:04:10.898]  I go, watch this.
[01:04:11.498 --> 01:04:13.319]  Are there people that like to pull hotties out?
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.141]  Oh, most definitely.
[01:04:15.161 --> 01:04:20.425]  But you'd also be surprised at the people that actually don't specifically go for the hottie.
[01:04:20.445 --> 01:04:21.666]  They'd rather go for the old lady.
[01:04:21.686 --> 01:04:23.167]  They'd rather go for the child or
[01:04:24.048 --> 01:04:24.489]  Yeah.
[01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.713]  They would rather you would think that they'd go for the hottie, but they wouldn't.
[01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:38.052]  See, I mean, attractive women are very beautiful, obviously, but I couldn't imagine wanting to make them let me put my hands on them.
[01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:41.874]  It just sends shivers up my spine.
[01:04:42.274 --> 01:04:44.095]  But I guess I'm not a sicko.
[01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:47.016]  Thank you so much for your courage, sir, calling in.
[01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.257]  We're going to have more TSA Tell All.
[01:04:49.277 --> 01:04:50.257]  We're going to get the documents.
[01:04:50.677 --> 01:04:52.678]  This is the type of thing they may come after us for.
[01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:53.779]  Please pray for us.
[01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:56.420]  We'll be right back with Jesse Ventura.
[01:05:03.081 --> 01:05:10.769]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[01:06:00.779 --> 01:06:02.039]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:07.440]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:12.282]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.682 --> 01:06:17.763]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:18.263 --> 01:06:22.944]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.484 --> 01:06:30.408]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.588 --> 01:06:31.489]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:38.073]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:38.393 --> 01:06:41.235]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.595 --> 01:06:44.737]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:52.080]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.121]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:57.442 --> 01:06:59.902]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:01.463 --> 01:07:15.887]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:20.651]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:33.617]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:34.377 --> 01:07:41.641]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:51.931]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:11.424]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.205 --> 01:08:13.106]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.747 --> 01:08:17.390]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.951 --> 01:08:22.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:26.189]  Well, he's one of my favorite guests.
[01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:27.170]  He's a friend of mine.
[01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:30.315]  He is the real McCoy, a real patriot who loves liberty.
[01:08:30.836 --> 01:08:31.997]  And he'll tell you like it is.
[01:08:32.157 --> 01:08:38.086]  Jesse Ventura, movie star, star wrestler, best-selling author, former Minnesota governor, also a mayor.
[01:08:38.527 --> 01:08:39.488]  His new book is out.
[01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:42.791]  And I should add, it's available at Infowars.com.
[01:08:42.811 --> 01:08:45.554]  It's excellent for people that are still in the whole left-right paradigm.
[01:08:45.915 --> 01:08:47.596]  Democrips and rebloblicans.
[01:08:48.017 --> 01:08:52.481]  And I've got a few news clips we're going to play later where he's on CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[01:08:52.922 --> 01:08:57.587]  And they're like, how dare you, you know, call them gang members?
[01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:02.151]  In the parties, or how dare you imply 9-11 could be something than what we were told.
[01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.852]  We're going to get his take on some of that.
[01:09:04.253 --> 01:09:10.278]  Because it's admitted that the West is using Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria to overthrow the governments.
[01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:15.202]  I mean, that's even in London Telegraph, LA Times, I showed it to you last hour.
[01:09:15.222 --> 01:09:20.546]  If you're a radio listener, I stream video at PrisonPlanet.tv, but I read the headlines on air.
[01:09:21.047 --> 01:09:24.049]  This is so crazy that this is going on.
[01:09:25.282 --> 01:09:31.067]  Now, Jesse Ventura has had a big battle with the TSA, as you know, but they won't even give him his day in court.
[01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.388]  We also want to get an update.
[01:09:33.409 --> 01:09:37.111]  We haven't talked to him in two weeks about where's the TV show that was finished four or five months ago.
[01:09:38.012 --> 01:09:51.203]  And also, I have confirmed from program directors, and you've heard them here on this show, radio stations we're on and that Eric Mankell-Muller's on, because we're on a lot of the same stations for whatever reason, like the Big 810 out in Orlando.
[01:09:52.421 --> 01:10:01.866]  They haven't had the problem that other stations have, where when Jesse Ventura's on and talking about the censorship of his episode, or FEMA camps, there's a scrambling that happens.
[01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:15.473]  Now we don't know if it's at the satellite, the radio satellite, I'm on a similar one to ManCalibra, a different one, or we don't know if it's the EAS that's wired in at the hub point, by law now, at the radio station transmitter.
[01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:20.971]  And I've talked to engineers, they say, yeah, they could send a radio control and scramble it.
[01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:24.861]  And now Obama has announced, this is in Reuters AP yesterday.
[01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:33.136]  That they're going to have EAS break in with and take over your cell phone with presidential announcements.
[01:10:33.716 --> 01:10:37.519]  And then your phone's going to have a presidential ring.
[01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:39.961]  And then it will override whatever call you're on.
[01:10:40.021 --> 01:10:42.522]  Same thing with TV, cable, everything.
[01:10:42.702 --> 01:10:46.245]  So let's talk about the censorship of the Police State episode.
[01:10:46.525 --> 01:10:47.866]  What's happening with the new episode?
[01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:50.208]  I know he was on Man Cow talking about this.
[01:10:50.248 --> 01:10:54.451]  We investigated it and interviewed program directors on-air and off-air.
[01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:56.432]  And let me tell you, it's freaking him out.
[01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.393]  So, Jesse, that was confirmed.
[01:10:58.673 --> 01:10:59.674]  What's your take on that?
[01:11:00.374 --> 01:11:04.616]  Well, you know, first of all, it won't affect me with the cell phone, Alex.
[01:11:04.756 --> 01:11:08.779]  I've never owned one, nor will I ever, so I'm going to plead ignorant on that.
[01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:18.044]  Unfortunately, I won't hear the President's messages because I don't use a cell phone, so I guess I'll have to get them some other way, or you can tell me about them.
[01:11:18.704 --> 01:11:30.369]  But, uh, no, I think it's very dangerous what's going on between that and these, that they now allow these unmanned drones, these surveillance drones are being okayed to fly throughout our country.
[01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:37.672]  You know, it's, uh, I hate to say it, but our Bill of Rights, as I state in my book, is in shambles.
[01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.974]  I mean, we've got government that just ignores it.
[01:11:41.014 --> 01:11:41.734]  They don't care.
[01:11:41.794 --> 01:11:43.855]  We don't have habeas corpus anymore.
[01:11:43.915 --> 01:11:47.737]  That's been suspended since George Bush started his folly in the wars.
[01:11:48.616 --> 01:12:01.665]  Obama's never reinstated it so you don't even have a right to a lawyer anymore in this country and I don't know when people here are going to wake up and realize that the Democrats and Republicans don't have your best interest in mind.
[01:12:03.246 --> 01:12:04.107]  Well I agree with you.
[01:12:04.147 --> 01:12:12.653]  Let me give you the headline because the guys were able to actually pull it up so you can read it and it has a link to the White House announcement and so radio listeners can also find it.
[01:12:13.213 --> 01:12:17.096]  The headline up at Infowars.com from that article
[01:12:18.397 --> 01:12:45.039]  States and we'll throw that back up on screen here real quick DHS cell phone alert system follows you around Presidential message to have their own distinctive ringtone and it's a we have links to the White House Announcement and the Department of Homeland Security statement and get this governor Walmart's are phasing in telescreens with big cysts on them Telling you to look out for terrorists
[01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:49.500]  Well, I guess they're going to inform us well, Alex.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.202]  Isn't that a wonderful public service they're doing for all of us?
[01:12:53.523 --> 01:12:57.906]  Weren't you in a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger where they have billboards saying, watch your neighbors?
[01:12:57.926 --> 01:12:58.906]  It was called The Running Man?
[01:12:59.046 --> 01:13:00.167]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:00.207 --> 01:13:02.309]  The Running Man is becoming quite prophetic.
[01:13:02.349 --> 01:13:06.351]  We don't quite have a game show like it because it's always based on a game show.
[01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:12.836]  Actually, The Running Man, for many people that don't realize it, it was written by a gentleman named Richard Bachman.
[01:13:12.876 --> 01:13:14.657]  That was a pseudonym for Stephen King.
[01:13:15.387 --> 01:13:20.492]  Stephen King wrote a group of short stories, The Running Man included, under that name.
[01:13:21.032 --> 01:13:29.359]  But it originated from Stephen King, so if anybody would know about bizarre things and have a bizarre imagination, it would be Stephen King.
[01:13:29.399 --> 01:13:37.646]  But he's like a prophet, because a lot of the things that he writes about, him and George Orwell, are now coming true today.
[01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:48.069]  You know, again, we haven't quite got to the point where we have the Running Man game show, but we're to the point where reality TV is getting pretty darn close to it.
[01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:56.071]  Well, we have all the gun camera footage of people being killed in Iraq in places, and in the video games, simulate killing.
[01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.712]  So I think in a way, they've turned war into a game show.
[01:13:58.752 --> 01:13:59.852]  I've talked to business owners.
[01:14:01.058 --> 01:14:03.099]  There's no doubt about it, Alex.
[01:14:03.459 --> 01:14:15.707]  You know, I feel for kids today, because kids that play these games and all these things that you see advertised on TV, you know, with the killing and all that stuff, it's going to callous them towards it.
[01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:23.231]  They're going to think it's an everyday activity in the normal way of life, and I don't think that's necessarily a good idea.
[01:14:23.332 --> 01:14:29.956]  One thing that's always amazed me, Alex, is how sex is rated X, but violence is only R.
[01:14:32.461 --> 01:14:38.824]  Oh yeah, you can have two boxers beat the daylights out of each other and that's family fun, but you see a woman's breast, it's the end of the world.
[01:14:38.964 --> 01:14:47.288]  Yeah, I mean it's just amazing how really strange we are as a society that sex could be X-rated.
[01:14:47.328 --> 01:15:00.855]  That's worse than running around with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and movies like that that show mass murderers and people being killed, left flasher movies, all that stuff.
[01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:04.998]  Those only get an R rating, but sex gets an X rating.
[01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:08.580]  Very, very well said.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.741]  I totally agree with you on that point.
[01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:13.623]  Well, I mean, they admit we're being desensitized to all this.
[01:15:13.983 --> 01:15:20.547]  Speaking of censorship, I know that you, we're not supposed to get into the whole story because some of that's private, but people always ask me about this.
[01:15:21.348 --> 01:15:27.492]  Here we are over a year later and they censored that Homeland Security FEMA special where you blew the camps wide open.
[01:15:28.452 --> 01:15:30.753]  Now they're doing urban warfare drills.
[01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:32.674]  The Army admits they've got the camps.
[01:15:33.754 --> 01:15:35.955]  I know you've been out of pocket, but I can send you that if you'd like.
[01:15:36.636 --> 01:15:38.256]  We were sent an Army document a few months ago.
[01:15:38.296 --> 01:15:40.157]  The Army came out and said you shouldn't have that.
[01:15:40.557 --> 01:15:42.398]  But yes, we have re-education camps.
[01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:45.579]  So much of this is coming out in the open now.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.262]  So recap for folks what happened with that episode and now what's happened with the new season.
[01:15:52.827 --> 01:15:59.148]  Well, what happened with that particular episode was, I believe it was, are we turning into a police state?
[01:15:59.228 --> 01:16:01.969]  And, of course, we discovered the documents.
[01:16:02.309 --> 01:16:05.910]  Congressman Cohn of Tennessee was one of the co-sponsors of it.
[01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:14.612]  And we found the documents where Homeland Security ordered FEMA to build no less than six detention camps.
[01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:21.033]  And, of course, the cover story is it's for disasters like Katrina, so that they will have places
[01:16:21.873 --> 01:16:23.195]  We're good to go.
[01:16:42.574 --> 01:16:47.256]  How can they be refugee camps when they build them with fences with barbed wire on?
[01:16:47.316 --> 01:16:54.218]  I mean, if they're just simply holding you there as a temporary thing due to a disaster, well then why would they need things of that order?
[01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:56.659]  Why you shouldn't be able to come and go as you please?
[01:16:56.739 --> 01:17:04.201]  And the thing to always look at for people, the novice way to look at it is, always look at the barbed wire on the top of the fence.
[01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:10.123]  If the barbed wire faces outward, it's to keep people from the outside getting in.
[01:17:10.956 --> 01:17:15.939]  If barbed wire faces inward, it's to keep people from the inside getting out.
[01:17:16.459 --> 01:17:25.225]  So that's one easy way, when you ever see a barbed wire or a chain-link fence with barbed wire on the top, look at the way the barbed wire is facing.
[01:17:25.285 --> 01:17:28.327]  If it's facing in, it's to keep prisoners in there.
[01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:32.149]  If it's facing out, then it's to keep outsiders from getting in.
[01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:37.416]  Also, if it's coiled on the top, it's a detention center in many cases as well.
[01:17:37.656 --> 01:17:39.958]  Oh yeah, if it's razor wire, absolutely.
[01:17:40.018 --> 01:17:41.920]  I mean, that's a whole different ballgame.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.843]  That's another cup of tea with that stuff.
[01:17:45.343 --> 01:17:47.946]  Razor wire will stop anybody from any direction.
[01:17:48.126 --> 01:18:04.598]  Well, I've talked to program directors who've confirmed, here on air, that when you go, that when you went on Man Cow, or that when I go on his show, and now I've confirmed it's happened to my show some, that they scramble it when we give bill numbers and, you know, talk about things like Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[01:18:05.158 --> 01:18:06.259]  What do you think's happening there?
[01:18:06.539 --> 01:18:11.662]  Well, Mancow, I've done his show twice now on this book tour, and he's informed me he's outraged.
[01:18:11.702 --> 01:18:13.123]  He's going crazy over it.
[01:18:13.663 --> 01:18:23.768]  I appreciate Mancow a little bit because, you know, he was the one who at first didn't believe that waterboarding was torture, but like a good journalist, he had it done to himself.
[01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:26.690]  And now he's completely reversed himself.
[01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.112]  He realizes that it is torture because he had it done to himself.
[01:18:30.752 --> 01:18:33.173]  You know, where they administered waterboarding to him.
[01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:35.174]  And you know it's bad because you've had it done to you.
[01:18:35.234 --> 01:18:36.554]  Yeah, back in seer school.
[01:18:36.574 --> 01:18:38.535]  We all essentially did many years ago.
[01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:42.877]  So, and they used to call it Chinese water torture, but they got a way of changing the names.
[01:18:43.397 --> 01:18:48.439]  Then it became waterboarding, and now thanks to Dick Cheney, it's called enhanced interrogation.
[01:18:48.479 --> 01:18:49.640]  But getting back to the show,
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.745]  That's what we learned in the course when we confronted Congressman Cohn with it.
[01:18:54.785 --> 01:19:02.874]  He actually read on the congressional floor an outrageous statement against me, Michael Braverman, and my television show.
[01:19:02.894 --> 01:19:07.839]  So we actually went into the congressional record on it, on that particular show.
[01:19:07.899 --> 01:19:10.943]  But the weird thing about it was it aired one time.
[01:19:11.776 --> 01:19:17.299]  And then it was taken off the air, and now TruTV won't even acknowledge we did the show.
[01:19:17.659 --> 01:19:19.581]  It's out there on YouTube, I would guess.
[01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:20.381]  It's still there.
[01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:21.422]  You gotta search and find it.
[01:19:21.442 --> 01:19:23.723]  I also erased it off the DVRs, Governor.
[01:19:24.223 --> 01:19:26.204]  Okay, well, that's news to me, too.
[01:19:26.444 --> 01:19:34.029]  So, uh, you know, obviously they don't want any of this out there for the public consumption or public comment or knowledge on it.
[01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:40.615]  And as far as the show goes this year, it's interesting because you were just talking about TSA and all that stuff.
[01:19:40.635 --> 01:19:41.315]  Hold on, Governor.
[01:19:41.335 --> 01:19:41.816]  Stay there.
[01:19:42.296 --> 01:19:42.677]  Stay there.
[01:19:42.697 --> 01:19:43.457]  We've got to go to break.
[01:19:43.497 --> 01:19:45.119]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:47.921]  Get his book and support the First Amendment.
[01:19:48.302 --> 01:19:49.923]  They can't erase this off your TiVo.
[01:19:49.943 --> 01:19:51.324]  Democrips and Republicans.

[01:22:00.701 --> 01:22:08.868]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors in every relationship, and one of the biggest is that men are losing libido, or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40.
[01:22:09.048 --> 01:22:11.430]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.
[01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:14.733]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every way.
[01:22:14.873 --> 01:22:16.314]  That's why we created TGen.

[01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:53.429]  Be unprepared or BePrepared.com.
[01:24:27.626 --> 01:24:30.749]  All right, Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:24:30.789 --> 01:24:35.494]  Gov, you were getting into the TV show for folks that just joined us.
[01:24:35.834 --> 01:24:37.336]  I was saying, where's the TV show?
[01:24:37.496 --> 01:24:41.540]  The third installment, I know it got into the TSA.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.461]  It was supposed to already air four or five months ago.
[01:24:44.022 --> 01:24:44.462]  Where is it?
[01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:46.865]  You said, that's interesting, Alex, and then we went to break.
[01:24:47.825 --> 01:25:08.620]  Well it is interesting because we finish the shows right on time like we normally do in November and usually the editing takes place immediately and we're on the air sometime in either mid-January or early February but here we are approaching July and the shows have not aired and of course one of the shows we focused on this year was the TSA.
[01:25:10.462 --> 01:25:34.074]  You know, and one of the things we learned is that they're going to come out with these wristbands that will, what they're going to sell to the public is they will have all your information and, you know, so you'll be banded much like a dog collar only it'll be around your wrist and therefore you can stick the wristband in something and they'll know exactly who you are, which seems on the surface like maybe a good thing.
[01:25:34.834 --> 01:25:39.296]  But underneath, what we also learned is they can decapacitate you with these.
[01:25:39.836 --> 01:25:42.577]  Much like a taser.
[01:25:42.597 --> 01:25:49.260]  Where if they want to drop you in the airport, if you're wearing one of these, they will have the ability to do that to you.
[01:25:52.051 --> 01:25:52.511]  Wow!
[01:25:53.471 --> 01:26:11.015]  Yeah, we learned that on the show, that these things also double for a security device, as I said, to where, like, they'll say if you're causing trouble, or you, we suspect you of being, you know, having bad purposes at the airport, that they can just literally drop you like a taser with them if you're wearing them.
[01:26:11.055 --> 01:26:16.856]  So, that'll be more stuff the Lemmings, I'm sure, will love to get, and they'll wear them faithfully.
[01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:20.349]  Well no, I saw Homeland Security a few years ago.
[01:26:20.369 --> 01:26:32.097]  They had a meeting and listened to a proposal to make everyone wear security bracelets and they added, oh by the way, as an afterthought, they have a taser function in them and Homeland Security was actually pushing it.
[01:26:32.658 --> 01:26:34.979]  So you're saying you were doing an episode researching that?
[01:26:34.999 --> 01:26:35.640]  Yeah.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.403]  Yeah, that's what's in the episode on the TSA where we expose that whole thing.
[01:26:41.147 --> 01:26:44.530]  That if you do put these, they'll require them at the airports.
[01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:49.494]  And that way, allegedly, you won't have to go through the body searches.
[01:26:49.514 --> 01:26:53.297]  You won't have to go through the x-ray machine if it properly identifies you.
[01:26:53.717 --> 01:26:59.722]  But on the flip side, it can also be used to decompa... Well, to, you know, drop you down.
[01:27:00.462 --> 01:27:04.706]  You know, and get you under control if they have any need to do that.
[01:27:09.982 --> 01:27:11.743]  I'm glad I'm not flying anymore.
[01:27:11.783 --> 01:27:19.384]  You know, I made the choice when they wouldn't allow me to go to court over my Fourth Amendment constitutional rights, saying they didn't have jurisdiction.
[01:27:20.024 --> 01:27:24.425]  I just followed what Janet Napolitano said, you know, the head of the Gestapo.
[01:27:24.605 --> 01:27:26.585]  That's what I like to call Homeland Security.
[01:27:26.605 --> 01:27:29.746]  She said, if you don't like it, don't fly.
[01:27:29.826 --> 01:27:31.846]  So I don't like it, so I'm not flying.
[01:27:37.526 --> 01:27:41.348]  I mean, if it's already this bad today, how much worse is it going to get?
[01:27:41.368 --> 01:27:42.548]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:27:42.568 --> 01:27:44.709]  You know what, I said this on another interview.
[01:27:44.789 --> 01:27:50.191]  I said, you know, this right now is the first time in my life where I can say this.
[01:27:51.272 --> 01:27:58.455]  All the rest of my life, no matter how bad today is in the United States, I always had the feeling that tomorrow would be a better day.
[01:27:59.015 --> 01:28:05.018]  This is the first time in my life that if it's bad today, I actually looked at tomorrow could now be worse.
[01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:13.316]  You know, I mean, we're getting an assault on the middle class that's unbelievable, you know, and people, and an assault on unions.
[01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:22.282]  Now, granted, unions can be, overreach their bounds, they can be, you know, bad because they're run by people, but for the most part,
[01:28:23.102 --> 01:28:35.711]  Unions are what created the middle class, and if you look at a chart that shows median wage, and if you look at the same chart that shows union falling, the lines are identical.
[01:28:36.191 --> 01:28:40.995]  As unions fall, so does median income, and they fall identically.
[01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.197]  People need to understand, it was unions that
[01:28:44.697 --> 01:28:47.038]  It gave us things like collective bargaining.
[01:28:47.118 --> 01:28:50.300]  It gave you things to be able to get health insurance at work.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.883]  It gave you things against the employers that you wouldn't have as an individual.
[01:28:55.903 --> 01:29:01.126]  Case in point, I did the Fran Tarkin Show, and he was wailing pretty hard on the unions.
[01:29:01.206 --> 01:29:02.226]  Then I brought up Fran.
[01:29:02.266 --> 01:29:03.127]  Remember something.
[01:29:03.707 --> 01:29:06.690]  You and the NFL had a union, or still have one.
[01:29:07.211 --> 01:29:09.993]  I said in pro wrestling we have never had one.
[01:29:10.454 --> 01:29:19.242]  That's why at one point in my career I wrestled 63 consecutive nights in a row without a day off.
[01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:20.323]  63 days in a row.
[01:29:20.963 --> 01:29:22.944]  Yeah, I never had health insurance.
[01:29:23.384 --> 01:29:25.045]  This was back in the early 80s.
[01:29:25.065 --> 01:29:30.147]  I was paying $5,000 a year to insure my family, my wife and my kids.
[01:29:30.687 --> 01:29:37.269]  Where if we would have had a union, I would have probably only had to pay $1,500 a year, because there's strength in numbers.
[01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:46.673]  And also, you know, in pro wrestling, where in pro football, pro baseball, all the sports that have unions, they have retirement.
[01:29:47.353 --> 01:29:50.035]  Stay there Jesse!
[01:29:50.215 --> 01:29:51.076]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.096 --> 01:29:53.197]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.118 --> 01:29:56.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.802 --> 01:30:04.945]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct.
[01:30:05.165 --> 01:30:08.867]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best horrible food on the planet.

[01:30:15.431 --> 01:30:16.692]  Your greatest dependency.

[01:31:06.235 --> 01:31:08.437]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:17.582]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.

[01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:34.514]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:31:34.814 --> 01:31:37.997]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:31:38.197 --> 01:31:39.978]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:31:40.118 --> 01:31:42.180]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.942]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:46.383]  It's what my family uses.
[01:31:46.664 --> 01:31:49.866]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[01:32:07.639 --> 01:32:12.402]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing Diamond Gussets.
[01:32:12.782 --> 01:32:19.546]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue Diamond Gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.487 --> 01:32:23.989]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:33.865]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:34.566 --> 01:32:39.207]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:39.627 --> 01:32:41.528]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.082]  Okay, Jesse Ventura is with us another 30 minutes.
[01:33:17.202 --> 01:33:18.443]  Always love having him on.
[01:33:18.483 --> 01:33:23.848]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 10-15 minutes for a quick comment or question for Governor Ventura.
[01:33:23.868 --> 01:33:24.048]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:24.068 --> 01:33:24.188]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:24.208 --> 01:33:27.892]  You got cut off by that break there, Governor, finishing your point about unions.
[01:33:27.912 --> 01:33:30.014]  Yeah, you'll see a lot of football players, others,
[01:33:38.581 --> 01:33:38.781]  Not at all.
[01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:39.962]  I'm going back to wrestling for a moment.
[01:33:39.982 --> 01:33:43.905]  The other thing is, in pro-wrestling, because there's not a union, there's no retirement.
[01:34:08.121 --> 01:34:12.886]  So you can wrestle 25 years, and let's face it, wrestlers are not accountants.
[01:34:12.926 --> 01:34:18.511]  They're not, you know, specialists to know how to invest and take care of their futures all the time.
[01:34:18.551 --> 01:34:19.872]  They're professional wrestlers.
[01:34:20.533 --> 01:34:24.457]  And you can put 25 years in the business, and when you're done, you get nothing.
[01:34:24.897 --> 01:34:25.497]  Not a thing.
[01:34:26.038 --> 01:34:29.121]  Because there's no union protection at all in pro wrestling.
[01:34:31.772 --> 01:34:32.452]  Well, there's not.
[01:34:32.472 --> 01:34:39.236]  You know, I've got a lot of questions here that I want to raise, Governor, but what is front and center on your plate right now?
[01:34:39.916 --> 01:34:41.317]  What's your greatest concern?
[01:34:41.997 --> 01:34:43.258]  What's stuck in your craw?
[01:34:43.338 --> 01:34:46.159]  Well, what I'm most concerned about is our loss of freedom.
[01:34:46.479 --> 01:34:53.163]  You know, the Bill of Rights to me has been, and our Constitution is in shambles, the very cleft of our nation.
[01:34:53.903 --> 01:35:17.539]  We're supposed to abide by, I mean, in Chapter 2 of my book, you know, I have quotes, remarkable quotes from George Washington, especially the father of our country, talking about how political parties, how awful they are, and Thomas Jefferson and John Adams too, and what troubles me the most is we're now a country that doesn't seem to want to read history, and of course the old cliché is true.
[01:35:18.099 --> 01:35:20.621]  If you don't read history, you're destined to repeat it.
[01:35:21.361 --> 01:35:30.530]  And we're heading right down that road because people are more interested in, you know, these phony reality shows on TV.
[01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:39.398]  They're more interested in, you know, sports happening throughout the world, which don't get me wrong, that's great entertainment and you need to entertain yourself.
[01:35:39.459 --> 01:35:45.985]  We all work hard and, you know, you owe yourself some entertainment, but you also owe yourself to pay attention.
[01:35:46.585 --> 01:35:48.807]  And pay attention to what's going on around you.
[01:35:48.927 --> 01:35:53.271]  And what bothers me most is most people have this lousy, fair attitude.
[01:35:53.351 --> 01:35:55.513]  Well, it isn't going to happen to me.
[01:35:55.994 --> 01:36:00.778]  And until it does come up and happen to them, they're not taking any precautions.
[01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.760]  They're not paying attention to government.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.962]  And people are not voting.
[01:36:05.562 --> 01:36:13.124]  And right now, voting against Democrats and Republicans, to me, has to be the number one order for this fall.
[01:36:13.224 --> 01:36:15.025]  I can't emphasize it enough.
[01:36:15.565 --> 01:36:19.647]  Stop voting for these two bought-out, bribed political parties.
[01:36:20.247 --> 01:36:26.809]  In fact, they used to always say, if you voted for me, Jesse Ventura in Minnesota, you were wasting your vote, because I couldn't win.
[01:36:26.829 --> 01:36:28.089]  Well, I did win.
[01:36:28.489 --> 01:36:33.731]  And we also ought to demand that Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for President,
[01:36:34.171 --> 01:36:36.553]  Be included in the debates this fall.
[01:36:37.093 --> 01:36:40.896]  Why do we only get two leaders of the two gangs who get to debate?
[01:36:41.336 --> 01:36:45.519]  Let's bring in a neutral person like Governor Johnson and see what he has to say.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:53.085]  And then if you still want to vote Democrat and Republican, well, at least you've been given a third option to consider.
[01:36:54.482 --> 01:37:07.930]  Well, you're right, and even if we don't agree with Johnston on every issue, the point is it's about forcing the two-party monopoly, the two twins, to let in another voice, which is something they desperately don't want, because...
[01:37:09.099 --> 01:37:10.500]  Alex, let me add something.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.142]  No one's ever going to agree with a candidate 100%.
[01:37:15.383 --> 01:37:21.948]  You're never going to see a candidate for public office where you can honestly say, you know, I agree with everything he says.
[01:37:22.008 --> 01:37:28.432]  Take Ron Paul and I. You know, I think Ron Paul would have been the best president without any doubt.
[01:37:28.752 --> 01:37:31.054]  And yet we differ on the abortion issue.
[01:37:31.074 --> 01:37:34.036]  Ron Paul does not support abortion at all.
[01:37:34.496 --> 01:37:34.896]  I do.
[01:37:35.677 --> 01:37:38.639]  I don't necessarily support people having abortion.
[01:37:39.219 --> 01:37:43.783]  But I don't support government telling women what they can or can't do with their bodies.
[01:37:44.263 --> 01:37:47.166]  Yeah, well, Ron Paul comes out and basically says it's become a state issue.
[01:37:47.226 --> 01:37:54.672]  And people are attacking Rand Paul right now because he's saying, hey, don't have mandatory federal labeling for GMO.
[01:37:55.092 --> 01:37:57.554]  But he's saying the feds don't have that jurisdiction.
[01:37:58.075 --> 01:37:59.556]  It should be a state issue.
[01:37:59.996 --> 01:38:01.177]  And that's a complex issue.
[01:38:01.197 --> 01:38:02.939]  But I understand why he's saying that.
[01:38:03.639 --> 01:38:15.146]  Well, I'll tell you, I just got a communication from Rand Paul, and let me tell you this, Alex, I don't know if you're aware of this one, you probably are, because you're usually more aware than I am, but I got a thing from Rand Paul.
[01:38:15.506 --> 01:38:20.849]  Are you aware of this treaty in the UN that they're going to try to get us to sign on to?
[01:38:22.163 --> 01:38:22.543]  Which one?
[01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:28.626]  They've got an anti... Well, it's going to happen this fall and it's one that will have international gun registration.
[01:38:28.846 --> 01:38:29.786]  Oh yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
[01:38:29.826 --> 01:38:37.330]  No, no, there's the treaty that Hillary says they're going to sign without Congress and register and restrict small arms, the UNITER treaty, yeah.
[01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:41.512]  And then there's also the Law of the Sea treaty that hands over everything to the U.N., yeah.
[01:38:41.772 --> 01:38:42.712]  Speak to that, Governor.
[01:38:42.732 --> 01:38:44.453]  Where do you stand on U.N.
[01:38:44.513 --> 01:38:46.174]  law restricting our guns?
[01:38:47.375 --> 01:38:53.901]  I mean, we have the Second Amendment, which is to protect our rights as individuals to have firearms.
[01:38:54.402 --> 01:38:55.242]  It's not there.
[01:38:55.302 --> 01:38:56.564]  People need to understand.
[01:38:56.624 --> 01:39:01.048]  They try to sell you, well, we're not going to inflict on your hunting and fishing.
[01:39:01.389 --> 01:39:03.711]  This has nothing to do with hunting and fishing.
[01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:07.595]  Back when they wrote the Bill of Rights, if you didn't hunt and fish, you didn't eat.
[01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:14.298]  So this was done so that the public could arm themselves in case government became oppressive.
[01:39:14.718 --> 01:39:19.940]  Well, what's going to happen with this deal is we will now throw our Second Amendment out the window.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.301]  We will then fall under an international arms law.
[01:39:23.741 --> 01:39:33.030]  That will tell you, that will require you to register all your guns internationally with some international unit who eventually, you know, is going to disarm you.
[01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:35.712]  And, you know, that's the liberal side of the issue.
[01:39:35.752 --> 01:39:36.613]  That's their thing.
[01:39:36.653 --> 01:39:39.256]  That's like Bill Maher on TVs for that.
[01:39:39.956 --> 01:39:42.497]  And I go, well, you know, how ridiculous is that?
[01:39:42.537 --> 01:39:48.940]  Because I was in the Philippines the day Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law and became a dictator.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:57.724]  The first thing he did as a dictator, he gave the Philippine people two weeks to turn in all their guns or it was the death sentence.
[01:39:58.524 --> 01:40:01.766]  Now, why would a dictator make that his top priority?
[01:40:02.646 --> 01:40:03.827]  It's obvious why.
[01:40:04.227 --> 01:40:06.948]  So the public has no way to rise up against him.
[01:40:07.864 --> 01:40:11.307]  That's right, Governor, and I'm very glad that you're here speaking about it.
[01:40:11.567 --> 01:40:16.092]  Here's our article, June 16th, InfoWars.com, Obama seeks U.N.
[01:40:16.112 --> 01:40:17.473]  and U.S.
[01:40:17.513 --> 01:40:19.395]  Congressional ratification of U.N.
[01:40:19.435 --> 01:40:23.739]  Global Gun Control Treaty, and then it has links to the U.N.
[01:40:23.759 --> 01:40:24.600]  in our article.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.163]  Where they're actually calling for it at the United Nations.
[01:40:42.492 --> 01:40:47.574]  Ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:40:48.174 --> 01:40:50.955]  So they're admitting they want a power monopoly, what you just said.
[01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:53.215]  I say that's illegitimate.
[01:40:53.816 --> 01:40:57.457]  And I tell you, if they want to cause a civil war, Governor, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:40:57.817 --> 01:40:59.477]  Look at it this way, Alex.
[01:40:59.497 --> 01:41:01.138]  I'll give you the best example.
[01:41:01.758 --> 01:41:04.119]  I live in Mexico five months out of the year.
[01:41:04.219 --> 01:41:07.940]  In Mexico, private ownership of guns is illegal.
[01:41:08.974 --> 01:41:10.736]  And look what's going on down there.
[01:41:10.756 --> 01:41:15.302]  20,000 to 30,000 people a year are killed by the drug cartels.
[01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:21.270]  Because the regular people down there have no mechanism to defend themselves.
[01:41:22.305 --> 01:41:28.687]  And so all these gun advocates that want to disarm us, take a look at the country of Mexico.
[01:41:28.807 --> 01:41:32.468]  As I said, they have big signs when you drive into Mexico.
[01:41:33.008 --> 01:41:36.209]  Firearms and even ammunition are illegal.
[01:41:36.289 --> 01:41:39.990]  If you're caught with them, you will go immediately to Mexican prison.
[01:41:40.863 --> 01:41:43.806]  And look at the end results, it's the old cliche.
[01:41:43.826 --> 01:41:47.970]  When the honest people don't have guns, only the bad people do.
[01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:50.633]  Because they're not getting theirs legally anyway.
[01:41:51.254 --> 01:41:55.778]  So they're gonna have guns, they don't care, one way or the other, the criminals.
[01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.481]  And that's exactly what would happen up here.
[01:41:58.841 --> 01:42:02.345]  The only people then that would have firearms would be criminals.
[01:42:03.348 --> 01:42:16.019]  I'm on the UN Treaty website where they say they want the abolition of all of our guns, and it says strengthening peace and security through disarmament, but then only the UN, who by the way is invading countless countries as we speak, has the guns.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.803]  Imagine what Hitler would have done if the rest of the world had been disarmed.
[01:42:20.163 --> 01:42:20.423]  Yeah.
[01:42:20.944 --> 01:42:22.225]  Well, you know, a little bit.
[01:42:22.305 --> 01:42:25.267]  I mean, we still had our militaries, naturally, that fought him.
[01:42:25.587 --> 01:42:27.989]  You know, it wasn't the civilian people necessarily fighting him.
[01:42:28.029 --> 01:42:29.450]  But now it's a global government.
[01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.531]  Now it's a global government.
[01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:33.473]  Yeah, but you're talking about a global government here.
[01:42:33.833 --> 01:42:37.376]  How then do we rise up if we don't like the global government?
[01:42:37.396 --> 01:42:44.541]  You know, I guess, you know, we can get a bunch of slingshots or something and stand up to
[01:42:45.287 --> 01:42:46.729]  Governor Jesse Ventura is with us.
[01:42:46.969 --> 01:42:49.032]  His book is already going up the bestseller charts.
[01:42:49.352 --> 01:42:50.794]  Democrips and Reblublicans.
[01:42:51.134 --> 01:42:54.519]  Get it out to everybody out there that you know who's not awake to what's happening.
[01:42:54.839 --> 01:42:56.241]  A lot of founding father quotes.
[01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:57.302]  A lot of great insight.
[01:42:57.663 --> 01:43:00.326]  Available at Infowarshop.com and bookstores everywhere.
[01:43:00.626 --> 01:43:03.170]  But speaking of global government, since we just raised that point,
[01:43:03.650 --> 01:43:08.214]  You were on the Kudlow Report last week, and I'm not going to play the whole clip because we don't have time.
[01:43:08.234 --> 01:43:15.780]  I don't want to go to calls, but they savaged you for daring to say there's some holes in the official 9-11 story, to say the least.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.681]  But let's stop there.
[01:43:17.101 --> 01:43:18.463]  Here's the same report.
[01:43:18.983 --> 01:43:20.504]  I thought there was no global government.
[01:43:20.544 --> 01:43:24.908]  I thought the big banks, like in your TV show last year, where you expose, run the global government.
[01:43:25.168 --> 01:43:26.630]  I thought that was all made up, Governor.
[01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:31.514]  Here is CNBC talking about the global government two days ago.
[01:43:32.594 --> 01:43:34.535]  Mostly what they do is hold summits.
[01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:39.896]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:43:39.936 --> 01:43:42.157]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:44.758]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:43:44.858 --> 01:43:47.318]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[01:43:47.358 --> 01:43:52.220]  Jim Muriel, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:52.680]  Fine.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.501]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.982]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt
[01:44:01.283 --> 01:44:09.307]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited about in that.
[01:44:09.648 --> 01:44:15.611]  So yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more money in.
[01:44:15.811 --> 01:44:20.774]  But the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than not willing to do it at all.
[01:44:20.995 --> 01:44:26.878]  And that's why we saw oil implode and gold trade off heavily, because they're not a protected class.
[01:44:26.918 --> 01:44:28.359]  If the stock market starts trading off
[01:44:28.439 --> 01:44:29.140]  We're good to go.
[01:44:43.456 --> 01:44:43.796]  I don't know.
[01:45:06.241 --> 01:45:18.585]  There were literally, in the last few weeks, more than 30 articles in mainstream news admitting an authoritarian world government's here, run by banks, but they know best and thank God they're there.
[01:45:18.985 --> 01:45:21.006]  Why do you think they're coming out in the open now?
[01:45:21.446 --> 01:45:24.207]  Well, because eventually the truth will come out, Alex.
[01:45:25.007 --> 01:45:29.588]  You know, you can't keep things hidden forever, so they want to get ahead of the eight ball.
[01:45:29.628 --> 01:45:39.130]  They want to put the spin on it, so that all the lemmings in the country will be comfortable with it when it actually does come a clear-cut reality out there.
[01:45:39.690 --> 01:45:40.670]  That's why they're doing it.
[01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:42.671]  It's very intelligent to do it that way.
[01:45:43.071 --> 01:45:49.252]  If it's going to happen, they want to be ahead of the curve on it, so that they can put their spin on it first.
[01:45:49.712 --> 01:45:54.633]  And that way, anyone else that opposes it will be fighting an uphill battle.
[01:45:54.973 --> 01:46:00.456]  Exactly, because people only remember the first time they heard it reported and how it was reported.
[01:46:00.736 --> 01:46:02.877]  They don't remember later, like the official story of 9-11.
[01:46:03.517 --> 01:46:06.799]  We're told, this is the official story, that's it, go back to sleep.
[01:46:07.099 --> 01:46:11.101]  But when you actually look closer, it's got more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
[01:46:11.682 --> 01:46:18.505]  On the same show, they tried to imply that you were bad and that you were saying, you know, like the Americans did it instead of the globalists.
[01:46:19.405 --> 01:46:20.246]  What's your take on that?
[01:46:20.566 --> 01:46:28.873]  Well, again, you know, anyone that questions 9-11 in this country to mainstream media is considered a nutcase.
[01:46:29.313 --> 01:46:30.474]  How dare you do it?
[01:46:30.615 --> 01:46:32.016]  You're unpatriotic.
[01:46:32.196 --> 01:46:35.279]  And, you know, they offer us no information.
[01:46:35.759 --> 01:46:46.228]  They accept a 9-11 report that had to be, I learned this, everything in the 9-11 report had to be agreed upon unanimously, or it didn't get in the report.
[01:46:47.156 --> 01:46:53.590]  You know, and everything of that nature, so it doesn't surprise me a bit, Alex.
[01:46:56.530 --> 01:47:00.992]  Well, the fact is, the system is scared of free thinkers, people that'll tell it like it is.
[01:47:01.052 --> 01:47:03.352]  Yourself, myself, Ron Paul, and so many others.
[01:47:03.412 --> 01:47:07.894]  But, as you pointed out earlier, the answer is everybody speaking out.
[01:47:08.934 --> 01:47:14.216]  Everybody not going along with the cookie-cutter, mainline system.
[01:47:14.596 --> 01:47:21.879]  Well, again, I'll tell you what, you know, you and I talked about organizing a boycott of the airports for one day.
[01:47:22.768 --> 01:47:33.984]  I'd like to change that now, and I think we need to organize and we need to protest the fact that the upcoming election will only be between two hand-picked people by the gangs.
[01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:37.611]  We need to get Gary Johnson in the debates.
[01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:45.256]  And I think if we're going to stand up and be counted, there's the spot to do it, because it's right on the horizon.
[01:47:45.936 --> 01:47:59.446]  Why should we only get the two voices of the two bribed-out parties, where you're going to get business as usual, when you've got a brilliant man like Gary Johnson waiting in the wings, who would make an outstanding president of the country?
[01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:02.007]  By the way, I saw clips on the news too.
[01:48:02.048 --> 01:48:03.048]  We've got the clip in there.
[01:48:03.529 --> 01:48:06.371]  Was it CNN or MSNBC where they were criticizing you?
[01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:14.997]  You were on the show and they're like, we don't like the fact that you're criticizing, calling them gangs.
[01:48:15.077 --> 01:48:16.418]  Do you remember that interview?
[01:48:16.739 --> 01:48:17.979]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:18.059 --> 01:48:21.182]  They came after me real hard.
[01:48:21.242 --> 01:48:29.148]  In fact, the guy tried to lecture me that I need to go out and talk to people to learn what a real gang is, the Crips and the Bloods.
[01:48:29.768 --> 01:48:38.276]  And I find that laughable considering I used to be a full-patch member of the Mongols Motorcycle Club, the black and white of Southern California.
[01:48:38.697 --> 01:48:41.359]  So, Alex, I speak from experience.
[01:48:41.479 --> 01:48:44.522]  I've been in a gang, and I've also been in government.
[01:48:44.902 --> 01:48:49.366]  These bozos on TV, all they do is go to college and write a book.
[01:48:49.386 --> 01:48:51.068]  They have no life experiences.
[01:48:51.488 --> 01:48:55.172]  They wouldn't know the inside of a gang if it came up and bit them on the ass.
[01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:57.172]  Well said.
[01:48:57.212 --> 01:49:00.321]  Let's jam in some calls in the time we have left with Jesse Ventura.
[01:49:01.143 --> 01:49:03.851]  Joe in South Carolina, you're first up.
[01:49:03.891 --> 01:49:04.232]  Go ahead.
[01:49:04.898 --> 01:49:08.179]  Hey, Governor Ventura, thanks for taking my call.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:17.263]  I'm just curious, you know, if we want a Romney or Obama after this, I mean, what is your prediction as to what the future will hold as far as TSA and whatnot?
[01:49:17.303 --> 01:49:19.144]  I mean, do you think it's just going to keep going on this way?
[01:49:19.164 --> 01:49:20.264]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:20.365 --> 01:49:28.968]  It won't matter which guy wins, whether it's Romney or Obama, because they're all going to go with the premise, just like they won't cut the military budget at all.
[01:49:29.648 --> 01:49:33.110]  No mainstream candidate will cut the military budget a bit.
[01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:39.699]  Because none of them want to be portrayed as soft on defense.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:44.386]  My God, we have enough nuclear bombs, we have enough military power.
[01:49:44.947 --> 01:49:49.533]  Our entire military budget is larger than the whole rest of the world's, damn near.
[01:49:50.294 --> 01:49:52.996]  I mean, nobody can beat our military.
[01:49:53.536 --> 01:49:55.098]  It can't be done right now.
[01:49:55.438 --> 01:49:57.860]  Why do we continue to have a military like that?
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:06.786]  And getting back to your question, it don't matter if you get Romney or Obama, you're gonna get the same policies you've had and the same ones you're gonna have.
[01:50:06.806 --> 01:50:11.449]  Does that answer your question?
[01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:12.590]  Yeah.
[01:50:14.221 --> 01:50:15.282]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:50:15.322 --> 01:50:16.443]  We're going to come back from break.
[01:50:16.483 --> 01:50:18.725]  Only got five minutes, six minutes left with Jesse Ventura.
[01:50:19.046 --> 01:50:20.527]  On the other side, so have your question ready.
[01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:26.093]  Christine in Washington, Shannon in Wisconsin, Mike in Mass, Aaron in Canada.
[01:50:26.113 --> 01:50:27.974]  We'll try to get to all of you.
[01:50:27.994 --> 01:50:31.418]  He's probably got another interview coming up after this where I twist his arm and do five more minutes with us.
[01:50:31.798 --> 01:50:34.721]  Billy Corrigan is coming up of Smashing Pumpkins.
[01:50:34.741 --> 01:50:35.722]  He's a listener of the show.
[01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:39.024]  This is a taped interview I did over the weekend with him.
[01:50:39.484 --> 01:50:40.525]  It's pretty bombshell.
[01:50:41.125 --> 01:50:43.006]  And so that is coming up as well.
[01:50:43.026 --> 01:50:44.687]  But Governor Ventura is our guest.
[01:50:45.927 --> 01:50:47.808]  Democribs and Republicans.
[01:50:48.568 --> 01:50:53.771]  The new book available at Infowarshop.com or at bookstores everywhere.
[01:50:54.091 --> 01:50:55.611]  Jesse Ventura again is our guest.
[01:50:55.631 --> 01:50:56.472]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:51:00.711 --> 01:51:01.952]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.012 --> 01:51:07.354]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.595 --> 01:51:12.217]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.617 --> 01:51:13.017]  It's true.
[01:51:13.077 --> 01:51:17.640]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:22.882]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.402 --> 01:51:25.323]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:25.723 --> 01:51:30.325]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.525 --> 01:51:31.405]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.625 --> 01:51:34.407]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.707 --> 01:51:37.988]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.308 --> 01:51:41.149]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.509 --> 01:51:43.389]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:44.649]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.970]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:47.790]  Remember, in a real crisis, seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:50.031]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.552 --> 01:52:03.033]  Survival is not about the end of the world.
[01:52:03.253 --> 01:52:07.094]  It's not about a hypothetical plane crash or the latest violet storm.
[01:52:07.295 --> 01:52:15.357]  Survival is about the satisfaction of knowing you can take care of yourself and your family in any situation, anytime, anywhere.
[01:52:15.618 --> 01:52:18.218]  CampingSurvival.com was started in 1956.
[01:52:19.659 --> 01:52:21.120]  No, not the dot-com part.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:22.600]  The survival part.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.142]  CampingSurvival.com has over 17,000 urban, wilderness, and preparedness items.
[01:52:28.323 --> 01:52:29.783]  Supreme customer service.
[01:52:29.923 --> 01:52:32.064]  Very low shipping and no games.

[01:52:35.165 --> 01:52:40.428]  And CampingSurvival.com is 100% USMC veteran owned.
[01:52:40.688 --> 01:52:44.289]  Don't base your survival on the latest spring up on the internet company.
[01:52:44.349 --> 01:52:46.830]  Do business with an authority on survival.
[01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:48.831]  CampingSurvival.com.

[01:52:55.313 --> 01:52:57.054]  CampingSurvival.com.
[01:52:57.294 --> 01:52:59.635]  Confidence born of preparation.
[01:53:00.115 --> 01:53:00.895]  You've been lied to.
[01:53:01.076 --> 01:53:04.617]  Lied to by corrupt Washington politicians and the Wall Street propaganda machine.
[01:53:05.057 --> 01:53:07.860]  My name is Brett Kitchen and I want to give you a free copy of my Inc.
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:21.275]  Magazine best-selling book, Safe Money Millionaire, because more Americans than ever are worried about having enough money in retirement, frustrated with losses in their 401ks or mutual funds, and upset about skyrocketing government debt and being ravaged by taxes.
[01:53:21.775 --> 01:53:25.678]  The Wall Street Casino has recently had all the previous gains of 2012 wiped out.
[01:53:26.158 --> 01:53:30.641]  And after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed several years ago, I said enough.
[01:53:31.241 --> 01:53:40.908]  Since then, I discovered an IRS-approved way to safely grow my money 12 to even 17%, cut taxes dramatically, but also have my money protected when the next crash comes.
[01:53:40.968 --> 01:53:49.914]  Call 888-885-8820 to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and J.C.
[01:53:49.954 --> 01:53:51.635]  Penney use to safely grow their wealth.
[01:53:52.055 --> 01:53:52.335]  Call 888-885-8820.
[01:53:52.375 --> 01:53:53.316]  Get your free book right now at 888-885-8820.
[01:54:19.005 --> 01:54:23.448]  All right, Governor Jesse Ventura will be with us five minutes in the next hour to take more of your calls.
[01:54:23.928 --> 01:54:24.908]  We appreciate him doing that.
[01:54:24.988 --> 01:54:28.310]  And then we've got the Billy Corrigan interview coming up.
[01:54:29.371 --> 01:54:31.272]  Talks about a lot of hardcore political subjects.
[01:54:31.292 --> 01:54:34.234]  This will definitely be a newsmaker, so stay with us for that.
[01:54:34.254 --> 01:54:39.517]  We talk about the New World Order, GMO, TSA, the police state, all of it.
[01:54:40.277 --> 01:54:43.179]  Christine in Washington, you're on the air with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:54:44.022 --> 01:54:47.425]  Jesse, I love and respect you totally.
[01:54:47.585 --> 01:54:49.967]  You are the most beautiful being of light.
[01:54:51.969 --> 01:54:53.630]  That is how I feel about you.
[01:54:53.731 --> 01:54:56.433]  You have more courage than any man I've ever met.
[01:54:57.113 --> 01:54:57.494]  Anyway.
[01:54:57.514 --> 01:55:03.039]  Well, I appreciate that, Christine, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there with more courage than me, too.
[01:55:03.659 --> 01:55:04.280]  I don't know any.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.884]  But anyway, Jesse, I wanted to know why you were not on Coast to Coast.
[01:55:09.779 --> 01:55:11.300]  I was looking forward to that.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:13.502]  Well that was probably just a time zone issue.
[01:55:27.831 --> 01:55:46.256]  I'm sure it's a time zone issue, so I'm sure that's going to happen.
[01:55:46.276 --> 01:55:47.516]  That's an important show to do.
[01:55:47.536 --> 01:55:51.077]  If you want to get the word out, it'll be more than all the shows you've been on combined, probably.
[01:55:52.158 --> 01:55:53.138]  16 million listeners tonight.
[01:55:53.178 --> 01:55:54.218]  Thank you so much, Christine.
[01:55:54.598 --> 01:55:56.719]  Aaron in Canada, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:55:58.086 --> 01:56:00.369]  Hey, Jesse Ventura, Mr. Jones, how's it going?
[01:56:00.469 --> 01:56:01.090]  Good, go ahead.
[01:56:01.931 --> 01:56:08.458]  Hey, I was just wondering how Jesse Ventura feels about InfoWars and Alex Jones selling pens and canteens from...
[01:56:09.935 --> 01:56:14.981]  Okay, there's a nice little... We sell a lot of stuff made in America, but we sell things from all over.
[01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:20.127]  We sell... I think the inside of the canteen is made in the U.S., but I think the tin is made in China, yeah.
[01:56:20.207 --> 01:56:21.148]  Well, fine.
[01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:22.870]  What about Walmart?
[01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:25.293]  Everything they sell comes from China, too.
[01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:27.075]  No, no, it's just a troll call.
[01:56:27.195 --> 01:56:28.917]  I mean, that's what people do.
[01:56:30.098 --> 01:56:31.739]  What are you supposed to do?
[01:56:31.839 --> 01:56:36.141]  I mean, I don't look at the label of where everything was made if I want something.
[01:56:36.201 --> 01:56:37.862]  Well, listen, we try our best.
[01:56:38.002 --> 01:56:40.423]  Most of what we sell is made in the United States.
[01:56:41.263 --> 01:56:43.984]  And I have nothing against the people in China having jobs.
[01:56:44.324 --> 01:56:48.226]  I'm against paying $20 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[01:56:48.566 --> 01:56:49.246]  That's wrong.
[01:56:50.087 --> 01:56:52.428]  So it's just a cowardly attempt to make us look...
[01:56:52.708 --> 01:56:59.770]  And not only that, Alex, when I use fireworks, most of that all comes from China and I certainly enjoy that on the 4th of July.
[01:57:01.751 --> 01:57:02.931]  Oh, it's all just ridiculous.
[01:57:02.951 --> 01:57:04.251]  We're all evil, actually.
[01:57:04.311 --> 01:57:05.852]  I just bought some fireworks on the 4th of July.
[01:57:05.872 --> 01:57:06.232]  I'm bad.
[01:57:06.632 --> 01:57:07.893]  Shannon in Wisconsin.
[01:57:08.453 --> 01:57:10.513]  You're not calling on a phone made in China, are you?
[01:57:12.174 --> 01:57:12.834]  Probably.
[01:57:12.954 --> 01:57:13.394]  Probably is.
[01:57:13.414 --> 01:57:16.795]  Hi, Jesse.
[01:57:16.855 --> 01:57:17.676]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:17.736 --> 01:57:19.156]  You guys are... I'm honored.
[01:57:19.176 --> 01:57:20.436]  You're two of my... Thank you.
[01:57:20.456 --> 01:57:21.437]  We're almost out of time.
[01:57:21.457 --> 01:57:22.157]  Do you have a question?
[01:57:22.995 --> 01:57:23.715]  Yes.
[01:57:24.056 --> 01:57:28.017]  You know, you had the thing, say, use your listeners for assets.
[01:57:29.118 --> 01:57:37.441]  My question is, with the TSA crap that's going on, why can't we have staged planned events, you know, to get the media hype?
[01:57:37.481 --> 01:57:44.644]  Because, you know, it's always that people don't react until it hits home, you know, like the guy getting his grandfather's ashes dumped.
[01:57:44.665 --> 01:57:45.925]  Let me interject.
[01:57:45.965 --> 01:57:52.328]  One of the problems with that, just like the Iraq War, there were massive pro-peace protests against the Iraq War.
[01:57:52.888 --> 01:57:54.909]  But you're dealing with mainstream media.
[01:57:54.929 --> 01:57:55.670]  They ignore them.
[01:57:56.210 --> 01:58:01.474]  If we were to go protest, what are the chances that mainstream media would even cover it?
[01:58:01.714 --> 01:58:03.915]  By the way, Governor, this just broke today.
[01:58:03.955 --> 01:58:05.936]  I'll ask you when we come back in the next segment about it.
[01:58:07.417 --> 01:58:12.421]  They dumped the guy's grandpa's ashes out to basically see what they were and then laughed at him.
[01:58:13.041 --> 01:58:14.742]  That's in mainstream television.
[01:58:15.382 --> 01:58:17.524]  This shows how crazy the TSA is.
[01:58:18.922 --> 01:58:20.302]  Oh, I agree with that.
[01:58:20.362 --> 01:58:22.943]  And let me make one statement here before we go.
[01:58:23.523 --> 01:58:28.564]  And this is to all military veterans as well as current military personnel.
[01:58:29.224 --> 01:58:39.466]  Remember, you took an oath to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights against all enemies, foreign and domestic, especially the current military.
[01:58:39.906 --> 01:58:43.747]  Do not, do not go against your own United States citizens.
[01:58:43.767 --> 01:58:44.027]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:44.067 --> 01:58:44.427]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:44.447 --> 01:58:45.087]  We're coming right back.
[01:58:52.722 --> 01:59:00.409]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:59:00.829 --> 01:59:04.453]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:00:01.206 --> 02:00:01.847]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.507 --> 02:00:03.548]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:04.289 --> 02:00:05.410]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:06.031 --> 02:00:06.852]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.632 --> 02:00:08.493]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.174 --> 02:00:12.797]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.358 --> 02:00:17.482]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:22.286]  Alright, coming up...
[02:00:23.743 --> 02:00:27.948]  Establishment Media is getting people ready for a total collapse where they'll pose as saviors.
[02:00:28.308 --> 02:00:29.589]  But it's getting really creepy.
[02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:31.091]  We're continuing with your calls now.
[02:00:31.111 --> 02:00:32.773]  I've got a guest on for about 40 minutes or so.
[02:00:32.793 --> 02:00:35.596]  Then we'll continue with calls right through to the end of the show.
[02:00:35.616 --> 02:00:38.919]  And a bunch of other world news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:42.563]  But right now, let's go back to Lawrence in Virginia.
[02:00:42.984 --> 02:00:45.406]  Lawrence, you were talking about and you got cut off by the break.
[02:00:46.027 --> 02:01:01.413]  People that are big TV watchers, the average adult thinks four and a half hours a day, the average child's over six, the average video game player is an additional three plus, I mean, the numbers change each year, it gets worse, that's the numbers, or a few years old, I should look up the latest numbers.
[02:01:02.529 --> 02:01:07.672]  But I've seen numbers of some people that watch up to, you know, 14 hours a day of TV or video games combined.
[02:01:08.132 --> 02:01:15.597]  It is insane, and they are in a dreamlike state, and they repeat whatever they see on television, thinking that makes them smart.
[02:01:15.977 --> 02:01:25.543]  It's only one echelon of people that even watch the news, and they think they're smart just for watching it, and they will regurgitate what they heard like they're showing off that they're smart.
[02:01:26.683 --> 02:01:30.824]  Still others that don't even watch the news, they just get the messages from TV.
[02:01:30.864 --> 02:01:39.166]  That's why the dramas, the sitcoms, the fiction is just laced anti-family, anti, you know, you name it, anti-gun.
[02:01:39.727 --> 02:01:47.869]  And for those of us that are awake, it's like watching clowns on PCP like lemmings run off the edge of a cliff.
[02:01:47.889 --> 02:01:48.249]  Go ahead.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:57.387]  Well, people tell me things like, well, I don't let it control me, I only watch certain things for get this information or that.
[02:01:58.268 --> 02:02:06.074]  And, you know, they've never read stuff like Edward Bernays' information, and I don't think any of us are smarter than them.
[02:02:06.094 --> 02:02:07.836]  They've been practicing this for over a hundred years.
[02:02:09.937 --> 02:02:12.880]  You know, it's like trying to outsmart the devil.
[02:02:13.905 --> 02:02:14.546]  No, exactly.
[02:02:14.566 --> 02:02:17.269]  You've just got to know it's super dangerous and they're a bunch of liars.
[02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:21.573]  Listen, I track what they do constantly and it's such a spaghetti of deception.
[02:02:22.014 --> 02:02:25.898]  It's like a cauldron that they're not even in control.
[02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:29.021]  They're like riding the beast, just like the Bible says.
[02:02:29.481 --> 02:02:32.865]  The New World Order is like a whore riding the out-of-control beast.
[02:02:32.885 --> 02:02:33.526]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:02:34.206 --> 02:02:34.687]  Exactly.
[02:02:38.912 --> 02:02:40.554]  I think people really need to turn that thing off.
[02:02:41.334 --> 02:02:42.695]  I stopped watching it years ago.
[02:02:43.396 --> 02:02:45.057]  Of course, I did it in increments.
[02:02:45.097 --> 02:02:49.100]  First, I stopped watching the news around Clinton, when Clinton was president, because he was lying all the time.
[02:02:50.061 --> 02:02:53.624]  And I just... I ended that.
[02:02:53.664 --> 02:02:54.825]  I don't watch that thing anymore.
[02:02:54.985 --> 02:02:56.406]  I get my information from the Internet.
[02:02:58.247 --> 02:02:58.908]  I read a lot.
[02:02:59.248 --> 02:03:00.429]  I think people need to read more.
[02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:02.751]  You can't really judge anything.
[02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:04.692]  And you have to read a lot of different things.
[02:03:05.153 --> 02:03:07.755]  If you just read one thing, you're going to get one opinion.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:23.787]  Well, what's going to happen is, over time, you're going to learn who's lying on purpose, who does an overall good job but makes some mistakes, that's what we do, who tells the truth but puts a spin on it, and, you know, you learn.
[02:03:23.827 --> 02:03:26.668]  You learn where people stand just by watching what they do.
[02:03:26.968 --> 02:03:28.469]  By their fruits, you will know them.
[02:03:29.776 --> 02:03:46.861]  And for anybody who sits there, I mean, I saw some so-called libertarian leader yesterday, I've never even heard of, at the Porcupine Fest, say, you know, don't engage in conspiracy theories, and then they defined conspiracy theories as thinking the government tries to take power or do corrupt things.
[02:03:47.362 --> 02:03:54.984]  And I'm like, well, I mean, what moron in any culture doesn't know you better keep the government under control or it'll grow out of control like cancer?
[02:03:56.389 --> 02:04:07.297]  And it just shows how over-the-top everything's gotten and just how desperate the power structure is to try to get people back into trust in the system.
[02:04:07.317 --> 02:04:10.419]  Look, the general public doesn't trust the system anymore.
[02:04:10.799 --> 02:04:15.322]  They just feel powerless and don't pay attention and so really aren't in the game.
[02:04:15.663 --> 02:04:20.366]  We've got to get people in the game to realize you're not going to have to save the world by yourself.
[02:04:20.806 --> 02:04:22.568]  You've got to do just little things
[02:04:23.488 --> 02:04:29.131]  Little things that will bring down the new world order together all of us doing little things Good to hear from you.
[02:04:29.151 --> 02:04:45.221]  I appreciate your call Lawrence We'll get to Chris Bob Ray Jason and others after our guest joins us or you can hang up if you don't want to sit on a hole for 40 minutes or something, but I want to hear what you have to say so stay with us and we're gonna get into undoubtedly the best film I've ever seen
[02:04:46.121 --> 02:04:50.525]  Documenting the fact that they know vaccines are killing and maiming people and covering it up.
[02:04:50.865 --> 02:04:54.868]  This is the film to give everybody who's on the fence about vaccine their kids.
[02:04:57.370 --> 02:05:03.956]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[02:05:04.516 --> 02:05:11.822]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:12.833 --> 02:05:16.555]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:17.535 --> 02:05:29.522]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:30.282 --> 02:05:37.566]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:38.246 --> 02:05:47.832]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:06:56.008 --> 02:07:01.251]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:07:01.512 --> 02:07:03.693]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:07:03.913 --> 02:07:09.456]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[02:07:09.636 --> 02:07:12.858]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:13.018 --> 02:07:16.200]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:07:16.461 --> 02:07:17.901]  There's no priming required.
[02:07:18.162 --> 02:07:20.203]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:07:20.423 --> 02:07:22.904]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:07:23.985 --> 02:07:25.326]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:07:25.506 --> 02:07:26.807]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:07:26.927 --> 02:07:29.789]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:07:30.110 --> 02:07:33.252]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:07:33.472 --> 02:07:35.253]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:07:35.373 --> 02:07:37.475]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:07:37.615 --> 02:07:40.217]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:07:40.357 --> 02:07:41.658]  It's what my family uses.
[02:07:41.938 --> 02:07:45.141]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[02:07:53.187 --> 02:08:01.655]  888-253-3139 The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:02.015 --> 02:08:04.297]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:09.298 --> 02:08:23.068]  You know, for all the bad things that are happening, it's a cycle throughout history of tyranny comes in, the people get oppressed, they fight back, people get morals again because they realize morals are about survival and taking care of your children.
[02:08:24.489 --> 02:08:28.672]  Then, people become decadent because once you have liberty, you get plenty.
[02:08:29.392 --> 02:08:37.138]  You become decadent over a few generations, corruption creeps back in, and then tyranny comes back in, and the cycle happens over and over again.
[02:08:38.476 --> 02:08:50.101]  And we've entered a very dangerous point in the cycle right now, where the power structure realizes the pendulum wants to swing back towards freedom, and truth, and decency, and honor, and quality, and beauty.
[02:08:50.742 --> 02:08:52.362]  And so they're trying to push it back the other way.
[02:08:54.784 --> 02:08:55.644]  We're in a fight here.
[02:08:55.924 --> 02:08:59.606]  Now, for the next 30 minutes or so, then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:09:01.772 --> 02:09:09.473]  We are joined by a filmmaker, and you know, this came in a few months ago before it was officially coming out, and Weldon said, hey, do you want to carry this?
[02:09:09.553 --> 02:09:10.494]  It's a new vaccine film.
[02:09:10.514 --> 02:09:14.754]  And I said, we already carry some presentations by Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who's, by the way, in this.
[02:09:14.794 --> 02:09:16.195]  We already carry some books.
[02:09:16.255 --> 02:09:16.915]  And he said, okay.
[02:09:17.295 --> 02:09:19.075]  He watched and he said, I think you need to watch this.
[02:09:19.575 --> 02:09:28.497]  And it's one, I don't know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 plus big film festivals.
[02:09:31.081 --> 02:09:42.366]  It's the greater good, and it is a film, by the way, that we carry at Infowars.com, so you support us and the filmmakers when you get it, and get a free Citizen Rule book.
[02:09:42.706 --> 02:09:46.147]  This is something you should give to every school library.
[02:09:47.568 --> 02:09:48.028]  Donate it.
[02:09:49.048 --> 02:09:50.309]  To every public library.
[02:09:51.863 --> 02:09:55.404]  You want to fight the New World Order folks, that's a great way to get my films, other people's films.
[02:09:55.764 --> 02:09:57.864]  I authorize you to make copies of my films, by the way.
[02:09:58.164 --> 02:10:01.045]  Just, libraries won't tend to take them, though, if it's a bad copy.
[02:10:02.585 --> 02:10:06.486]  Side issue, the point is, you know, a bad-looking cover because they think it's bootlegged or something.
[02:10:07.106 --> 02:10:08.667]  We allow you to bootleg, but they won't.
[02:10:09.167 --> 02:10:09.707]  Side issue.
[02:10:10.087 --> 02:10:12.448]  The point is, you should air these on AXS television.
[02:10:12.928 --> 02:10:15.328]  You should give it to people that you see that have children.
[02:10:15.688 --> 02:10:18.629]  If you have neighbors, you see that the woman is pregnant.
[02:10:20.618 --> 02:10:21.218]  I can't help it.
[02:10:21.238 --> 02:10:26.759]  I see pregnant women now in grocery stores, even with their husband, and I'll come over and I'll say, man, isn't it great?
[02:10:26.799 --> 02:10:27.700]  I've got three children.
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:32.481]  Hey, you might want to look into vaccines because they even tell pregnant women to take vaccines now.
[02:10:32.541 --> 02:10:37.822]  And until four years ago, they always said don't take them because of autoimmune problems and miscarriages.
[02:10:38.362 --> 02:10:42.403]  And a lot of times they go, yeah, we heard that it was always bad to take shots.
[02:10:43.163 --> 02:10:52.127]  My sister's a nurse, this just happened about a week ago, the lady said, and she says until a few years ago they said don't take them, but now they're saying we should, but she's saying I shouldn't.
[02:10:52.187 --> 02:10:52.728]  Thank you.
[02:10:54.048 --> 02:10:58.370]  And if somebody does say, hey, mind your own business, I've never had that happen, just say, okay, I warned you.
[02:10:59.091 --> 02:11:00.972]  And again, that's not getting in somebody's business.
[02:11:01.372 --> 02:11:05.294]  If you know that until about three and a half, four years ago,
[02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:12.912]  It was a big PR rollout saying, especially pregnant women, all the inserts before, and by the way they still say it, said, don't take this when you're pregnant.
[02:11:13.912 --> 02:11:15.613]  And now they say, well talk to your physician.
[02:11:16.253 --> 02:11:17.494]  Because they've always known this.
[02:11:17.534 --> 02:11:20.615]  I mean, doctors, nurses listening, they're like, yeah, that's always been the case.
[02:11:21.195 --> 02:11:23.556]  Again, the system is fleeing forward.
[02:11:25.157 --> 02:11:32.700]  In that they know there's massive opposition, the media admits that, they admit all these medical people are coming out, all this is unfolding, and so their answer is,
[02:11:34.275 --> 02:11:35.356]  Well, they've got national maps.
[02:11:35.396 --> 02:11:39.621]  The higher educated area of the country, the lower the vaccine rates.
[02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:46.068]  And the news says these wealthy, well-to-do, college-educated people have gone crazy.
[02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:55.205]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we've gone from 1 in 25,330-something years ago with autism to 1 in 58 now.
[02:11:55.645 --> 02:11:56.846]  And it's a cocktail of things.
[02:11:56.866 --> 02:11:59.007]  But the point is, this stuff is deadly.
[02:11:59.027 --> 02:12:04.311]  And it's not just the mercury that goes by the blood-brain barrier because it's directly injected into the body.
[02:12:05.252 --> 02:12:06.593]  It's the adjuvants.
[02:12:06.653 --> 02:12:09.475]  Dr. Blaylock, brain surgeon, and others have broken down.
[02:12:09.675 --> 02:12:10.716]  And they have studies on this.
[02:12:10.796 --> 02:12:11.337]  They know.
[02:12:12.748 --> 02:12:16.270]  Enough of me, because I want to give her at least 30-40 minutes before we go to your calls.
[02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:20.853]  It's just that I want you to understand, this is show life and death, and this is finally the tool.
[02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:31.540]  Just like A Noble Lie is great to expose false flag terror, finally a high-quality professional film with all the police officers and witnesses about Clinton carrying out that attack.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:34.242]  A Noble Lie available at InfoWars.com.
[02:12:34.362 --> 02:12:38.424]  Finally, we have The Greater Good, available at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:12:39.725 --> 02:12:41.626]  Get it, get it out to everyone you know.
[02:12:41.706 --> 02:12:43.347]  Also, greatergoodmovie.org.
[02:12:43.868 --> 02:12:45.569]  But again, infowarshop.com.
[02:12:45.989 --> 02:12:50.151]  It's won all these big international and national film festivals.
[02:12:50.191 --> 02:12:51.172]  I won't even try to go over them.
[02:12:51.872 --> 02:12:55.074]  It won the big Dock in NYC, that's coveted.
[02:12:55.375 --> 02:12:58.677]  The Dallas Film Festival, the big official one.
[02:13:01.278 --> 02:13:05.781]  It won the Cinematic Vision Award, 2011 Amsterdam Film Festival.
[02:13:07.594 --> 02:13:08.396]  It just goes on and on.
[02:13:08.416 --> 02:13:12.948]  The point is it takes years to go through the film process, so now it's finally available on DVD.
[02:13:13.269 --> 02:13:14.171]  This film's amazing.
[02:13:14.232 --> 02:13:15.194]  Here's the trailer!
[02:13:16.479 --> 02:13:23.962]  The trailer's up at InfoWars.com if you're a radio listener, but here for the full audience is the video slash audio of the trailer for The Greater Good.
[02:13:24.362 --> 02:13:27.303]  This has to be in the hands of every nurse, every doctor.
[02:13:27.883 --> 02:13:29.704]  Force them morally to face what's happening.
[02:13:30.124 --> 02:13:33.545]  Every family getting ready to have children, you need to see The Greater Good.
[02:13:34.026 --> 02:13:40.548]  Very well produced, key testimony about the cover-up, the fact they know it's killing and maiming people consciously.
[02:13:40.868 --> 02:13:43.769]  The CDC's own documents, this is the proof.
[02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:45.730]  Here is the trailer.
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:49.022]  Two years ago, a vaccine completely changed my life.
[02:13:49.122 --> 02:13:54.846]  I would do anything to get my life back to normal.
[02:13:55.027 --> 02:13:57.228]  History teaches us how effective vaccines are.
[02:13:57.248 --> 02:14:00.691]  Vaccines are the best choice for almost all children.
[02:14:00.771 --> 02:14:02.292]  I don't think it's that black and white.
[02:14:02.392 --> 02:14:04.794]  Vaccines in some way have been a victim of their own success.
[02:14:05.474 --> 02:14:10.058]  The government, they're trying to protect society, but these motivations interfere with, you know, safety issues.
[02:14:11.974 --> 02:14:15.776]  In the last few decades, the numbers of doses of vaccines have more than tripled.
[02:14:15.896 --> 02:14:19.398]  We are seeing a rise in the number of children with disabilities.
[02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:23.320]  What if these shots that are supposed to protect kids actually hurt your child?
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.241]  After the shots, I started getting sick.
[02:14:25.461 --> 02:14:30.283]  I've had two strokes, partial paralysis, partial vision, and I'm having seizures.
[02:14:30.483 --> 02:14:33.965]  I would have never dreamt that this was a side effect of a vaccine.
[02:14:36.252 --> 02:14:38.333]  Many of these have the potential to be neurotoxic.
[02:14:38.413 --> 02:14:42.175]  The research is incomplete and the certainty is not scientific.
[02:14:42.195 --> 02:14:46.256]  A number of prescription drugs that have been licensed as safe have been found to be unsafe.
[02:14:46.276 --> 02:14:52.499]  The social fabric is better to insist on vaccination than to allow free reign.
[02:14:52.559 --> 02:14:57.301]  The people who are approving the vaccines are taking the word of the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:14:57.341 --> 02:15:02.123]  The majority of vaccine research is paid for by the vaccine manufacturers themselves.
[02:15:03.834 --> 02:15:09.096]  We're the only country other than New Zealand that allows advertising on TV for pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:15:09.136 --> 02:15:11.837]  You can't sue the drug company that made the vaccine.
[02:15:11.897 --> 02:15:13.618]  That's not science, that's politics.
[02:15:13.718 --> 02:15:18.820]  Texas Governor Rick Perry has ordered that schoolgirls must get the Gardasil shot.
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:21.562]  We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.
[02:15:21.622 --> 02:15:24.783]  The only thing that we oppose is forced vaccination.
[02:15:24.923 --> 02:15:28.965]  Sadly, some people don't do what's best for their children unless it's mandated.
[02:15:30.305 --> 02:15:31.086]  We're not zealots.
[02:15:31.346 --> 02:15:35.089]  We're not some people that are looking for a conspiracy or a fight.
[02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:37.951]  The vaccine program, it's one size fits all.
[02:15:37.991 --> 02:15:39.252]  We worry about the future.
[02:15:39.312 --> 02:15:45.057]  You could have 30, 40, 50 different vaccines mandated and absolutely no accountability.
[02:15:45.177 --> 02:15:46.679]  You have a prescription for disaster.
[02:15:48.107 --> 02:15:51.910]  I have a child, and then I follow the rules, and I damage this child.
[02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:54.412]  That's hard for me to understand.
[02:15:54.692 --> 02:16:01.297]  I just want everybody to lay down their arms and figure out what is making them so sick.
[02:16:04.019 --> 02:16:06.661]  The Greater Good, available at Infowarshop.com.
[02:16:06.741 --> 02:16:10.444]  And again, it goes from the perspective of showing both sides.
[02:16:10.905 --> 02:16:12.366]  That's what makes it so effective.
[02:16:12.966 --> 02:16:13.807]  But here's the issue.
[02:16:15.165 --> 02:16:29.858]  They have the clips that I talked about four years ago in Maryland where they said, it's the law, you'll be arrested if you don't take shots, with all the black people, like it's a concentration camp, being herded in to be shot up with darking police dogs, and I got
[02:16:30.922 --> 02:16:38.085]  The state attorney who says that on my show, he started laughing and admitting it wasn't the law and that he doesn't give his kids the shots.
[02:16:38.605 --> 02:16:40.266]  Like it was cute and cool!
[02:16:41.106 --> 02:16:44.068]  And they've got that clip from years ago I couldn't find in the film.
[02:16:44.528 --> 02:16:46.049]  That's why it's so powerful.
[02:16:46.589 --> 02:16:48.030]  Alright, I've given you the pitch.
[02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:50.050]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:16:50.431 --> 02:16:52.371]  This is coffin nails to their lives.
[02:16:52.632 --> 02:16:53.872]  And I will say what the film doesn't.
[02:16:53.952 --> 02:16:57.814]  I have all the Rockefeller documents, the Sterling Senate, the cancer viruses.
[02:16:58.254 --> 02:16:59.334]  It's on purpose, okay?
[02:16:59.755 --> 02:17:00.315]  It's that simple.
[02:17:01.632 --> 02:17:03.894]  The Rockefellers took over medicine 80, 90 years ago.
[02:17:03.934 --> 02:17:08.657]  They funded Hitler, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, it's eugenics, better learn about it, better find out.
[02:17:08.937 --> 02:17:11.519]  Then they sell you the treatments that they control as well.
[02:17:12.099 --> 02:17:14.981]  Alright, I want to go to Leslie.
[02:17:16.519 --> 02:17:17.059]  Well, I
[02:17:35.874 --> 02:17:40.558]  Thank you so much for the fantastic introduction and for having me on the show, Alex.
[02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:41.820]  It's really a pleasure to be here.
[02:17:43.041 --> 02:17:48.126]  I couldn't agree with you more that this is one of the most important issues that we face today on the planet.
[02:17:53.831 --> 02:18:04.877]  The really cavalier attitude of this public health official saying that, you know, he doesn't give them to his own kids, but he's rounding up literally 2,000 families for not giving their kids chickenpox vaccine or something like that.
[02:18:04.997 --> 02:18:08.999]  And I think we all really have to ask ourselves, what have we come to?
[02:18:09.659 --> 02:18:10.260]  Where are we?
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:13.521]  And are these policies based on sound science?
[02:18:13.822 --> 02:18:19.245]  Are these compounds that we're injecting into our 12-hour-old infants safe?
[02:18:20.365 --> 02:18:21.726]  Is there a reason to be doing this?
[02:18:22.566 --> 02:18:34.976]  And I think the answer to all those questions is really that the science doesn't support it, that the science isn't there, and that these policies are not based on a sound foundation of science.
[02:18:35.296 --> 02:18:38.499]  And if that's not the case, then how can we possibly be endorsing this?
[02:18:38.679 --> 02:18:47.847]  In particular, given that we require children in many states to have them before they can go to school, or for other public health services, which are paid through taxes.
[02:18:47.907 --> 02:18:51.049]  So I think we're really in a place where
[02:18:52.478 --> 02:18:56.781]  You know, people need to start questioning what we're doing and why.
[02:18:56.801 --> 02:19:03.145]  And why God gave us immune systems in the first place and what we can do to keep those so strong and healthy.
[02:19:04.085 --> 02:19:08.248]  And whether or not we need the government to tell us how to behave or how to keep our immune systems.
[02:19:09.824 --> 02:19:14.968]  Well, it's as you point out, if some pandemic came out and then they had something that was proven to be effective, that's one thing.
[02:19:15.008 --> 02:19:22.014]  But hundreds of vaccines they want to bring online and imply, like Perry did, that it's the law when it wasn't the law.
[02:19:22.114 --> 02:19:27.319]  And through fraud, like in Maryland or Texas, people line up believing they're being forced to.
[02:19:28.297 --> 02:19:39.902]  Well, and this is the thing, I live in the state of Idaho, and in Idaho we have a law that says very clearly that any person can choose, for any reason they deem appropriate, not to vaccinate themselves or their child.
[02:19:40.482 --> 02:19:49.246]  But that does not stop the school district every year from taking out large advertisements in the newspapers stating that children must be immunized before they can come to school.
[02:19:49.266 --> 02:19:50.246]  Lisa, bingo!
[02:19:50.306 --> 02:19:54.788]  Let's come back and talk about that fraud and break down the film, A Home Run of Truth.
[02:19:56.730 --> 02:20:03.631]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:20:03.871 --> 02:20:21.315]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:20:21.575 --> 02:20:25.636]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:20:25.916 --> 02:20:27.457]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:20:27.657 --> 02:20:35.442]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:00.231]  Why?
[02:23:00.512 --> 02:23:01.872]  Because I have an Aquapod.
[02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:04.094]  Got it from mypatriotsupply.com.

[02:24:03.345 --> 02:24:09.189]  Here's the cover of the Greater Good DVD award-winning film, now available on DVD.
[02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:15.153]  Anthony Kaufman of the Wall Street Journal wrote, A new documentary about childhood immunizations.
[02:24:15.734 --> 02:24:20.817]  The Greater Good could intensify debate around the potential dangers of vaccines.
[02:24:20.837 --> 02:24:21.378]  Uh, yeah.
[02:24:22.947 --> 02:24:25.290]  Yeah, it's like handing two-year-olds loaded shotguns.
[02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:30.436]  I mean, this is just amazing that they've gotten away with this.
[02:24:30.616 --> 02:24:37.303]  And our guest, Lisa, who is Leslie, who's joining us right now.
[02:24:38.689 --> 02:25:06.182]  was just breaking down if she's the uh... writer and producer of this film she was just breaking down the deception how they say it's the law and then I get the guy and I go you know it's not the law and he laughs and goes yeah I know I don't give my kids shots I mean this is sick how in every town you're listening and they lie to you and say it's the law please continue you know what Alex I think the most interesting thing is that
[02:25:07.248 --> 02:25:11.632]  We never actually studied the safety of mercury before it was put into childhood vaccines.
[02:25:12.492 --> 02:25:18.037]  We never studied whether it was safe to put in contact lens solutions or in antacids or any of the places it's been put.
[02:25:18.217 --> 02:25:19.398]  Aluminum's been put in there too.
[02:25:19.458 --> 02:25:27.244]  We never studied the safety of aluminum and it's been used as an adjuvant, an immune system stimulant, for 80 years in vaccinations.
[02:25:28.005 --> 02:25:32.829]  And what's really interesting to me now is that in the last three to five years, there's a growing
[02:25:33.816 --> 02:25:40.958]  group of scientists who are actually starting to do this research, despite the fact that it's very, very risky for their careers and their futures.
[02:25:41.498 --> 02:25:54.141]  And they are finding that the aluminum vaccine is causing cognitive impairment, brain damage, neuron cell death in animal models, autoimmune syndromes, all sorts of immune dysfunction.
[02:25:54.801 --> 02:26:00.943]  And these authors have written that the potential for just aluminum, just the aluminum component on its own,
[02:26:01.542 --> 02:26:08.705]  To cause profound impact on the brains and the immune systems of human beings is profound, immense.
[02:26:09.506 --> 02:26:12.767]  And yet, the CDC and FDA say that it's perfectly safe.
[02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:21.140]  And this is what I find the most astounding, is that this has been going on for not just a few years, but nearly a hundred years, and yet no one's bothered to stop it.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.940]  Well, I saw mainline studies out of England and the U.S.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:33.942]  a decade ago, where they were saying three shots for the flu, three vaccines, doubled the chances for Alzheimer's in studies they did.
[02:26:34.402 --> 02:26:37.383]  They know, they know aluminum cans and aluminum cookware.
[02:26:37.903 --> 02:26:40.624]  I mean, there are 45-year-olds getting Alzheimer's now.
[02:26:40.964 --> 02:26:42.204]  Neurological disorders.
[02:26:43.184 --> 02:26:43.924]  Off the charts.
[02:26:44.365 --> 02:26:45.685]  Cancer off the charts.
[02:26:46.125 --> 02:26:57.010]  Everything we do in Western culture, the bisphenol A, is now big studies linked to brain tumors, linked to women going into puberty early, men becoming feminized.
[02:26:57.930 --> 02:27:02.412]  This industrial society, the way it's been deployed, is killing us.
[02:27:04.133 --> 02:27:04.753]  Without a doubt.
[02:27:04.793 --> 02:27:11.836]  And if you look at the fertility rates, the sperm counts of men in the last 50 years, a decline of 50 percent, at least.
[02:27:12.555 --> 02:27:15.936]  If you look at, you know, how difficult it is for women to conceive, same thing.
[02:27:16.557 --> 02:27:25.300]  And there's clearly a role that vaccines play and the toxins that vaccines contain in disrupting our endocrine systems, our hormonal systems.
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:30.942]  So, you know, I don't know how far the average person wants to go down that rabbit hole.
[02:27:31.003 --> 02:27:35.945]  I mean, clearly your viewers and listeners are far more up to speed on those issues than the
[02:27:37.643 --> 02:27:51.773]  Massive, you know, the general public, but there are clearly questions raised when we start taking vaccines that have aluminum and mercury in them, or mercury that's been banned in the United States and given to the entire world outside the U.S.
[02:27:51.893 --> 02:27:52.974]  and other developed countries.
[02:27:54.014 --> 02:27:57.337]  It really has to give you pause about what the policies are really about.
[02:27:57.957 --> 02:28:10.104]  And when we know that these things are disrupting our hormonal balances, and then you combine them with all the pesticides, and as you say, the bisphenol A, and all the other contaminants in our food supply, the GMO food, you know, on and on and on.
[02:28:10.144 --> 02:28:23.152]  These things are clearly having a major impact on our ability to procreate, our ability to think independently, our ability to stand up for ourselves, and our ability, I think, to really question what's going on.
[02:28:25.237 --> 02:28:32.382]  Vaccines are, you know, without going too far down that rabbit hole, clearly are causing damage.
[02:28:32.522 --> 02:28:42.329]  And I think the point of our film is that not that we know all of this, it's proven, not that it's unequivocal, but that there is a growing body of science out there that casts
[02:28:44.898 --> 02:28:49.220]  All I know is women's breast cancer is up 2,000 plus percent.
[02:28:49.541 --> 02:28:52.502]  Pediatric cancer, depending on which type, over 10,000 percent.
[02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:57.946]  Autism, thousands and thousands of percentage from 25,000 to 1 in 68, 1 in 57.
[02:28:58.066 --> 02:29:00.007]  I mean, it varies the numbers.
[02:29:00.887 --> 02:29:08.952]  Everywhere where it's industrialized, neurological disorders, skeletal disorders, what's going on is killing us.
[02:29:10.862 --> 02:29:20.173]  The CDC and FDA, the vaccine authorities in general, continue to assert that there is no science leaking mercury to autism.
[02:29:20.653 --> 02:29:31.726]  And yet an independent scientist did a review of all of the available science, empirical research, looking into the mercury-autism link, and she found that the body of science favored a link 3 to 1, not the reverse.
[02:29:32.088 --> 02:29:34.471]  Stay there, we're gonna come back and break down some more of those numbers.
[02:29:35.152 --> 02:29:43.321]  There's been other big studies as well, where nations that have higher vaccine rate have higher rates of all sorts of diseases.
[02:29:43.341 --> 02:29:43.962]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:45.724 --> 02:29:48.727]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:15.384]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:17.326 --> 02:30:19.507]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[02:33:02.719 --> 02:33:21.665]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm a guy who's a boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way If you break the law you'll hear from me I know I'm working for the state on the highway patrol
[02:33:23.685 --> 02:33:25.966]  Earlier I was looking around for...
[02:33:45.831 --> 02:33:59.079]  The proper quote in Providence, if my memory was correct, it was a Marine Corps General known as the Professor because he studied so much military doctrine and was so successful in World War II and the Korean War.
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:08.404]  They were surrounded at the Chosin Reservoir in Korean War, early in December 1950 to be precise.
[02:34:10.005 --> 02:34:10.826]  They were surrounded.
[02:34:12.406 --> 02:34:16.088]  He succeeded in breaking through and leading a 70 mile march to safety.
[02:34:16.109 --> 02:34:18.510]  It was reportedly more than 20 times their numbers.
[02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:22.233]  I just went and looked it up on the history site who he was from my memory.
[02:34:23.553 --> 02:34:26.195]  And he said, Sir, we are surrounded.
[02:34:26.636 --> 02:34:27.016]  Excellent.
[02:34:27.036 --> 02:34:28.377]  We can attack in any direction.
[02:34:28.997 --> 02:34:30.818]  That wasn't really even a sarcastic point.
[02:34:31.439 --> 02:34:39.464]  If you've got a smaller force, but have more high power workable weapons, this is the communist Chinese they were fighting didn't have very good weapons.
[02:34:39.984 --> 02:34:41.165]  Doesn't matter if it's 10, 20, 30 times the number.
[02:34:42.986 --> 02:34:45.987]  Now you can attack in any direction, go any direction you want.
[02:34:47.408 --> 02:34:52.230]  And of course some would look at it as, I mean obviously it's a bad place to be in, but now you're committed.
[02:34:52.810 --> 02:34:54.171]  Now there's not any games.
[02:34:54.791 --> 02:34:56.111]  Now you know you've got to fight.
[02:34:57.092 --> 02:34:59.733]  And that's the position we have to put ourselves in.
[02:34:59.753 --> 02:35:05.275]  You know, I get emotional about this because I sit here calmly researching this year after year.
[02:35:05.895 --> 02:35:07.716]  And when I pop this in the DVD player,
[02:35:08.796 --> 02:35:18.519]  And because I would go from memory and say, oh yeah, the state attorney, I had him on, lining up thousands of black people crying with dogs barking at him, saying it's the law, you gotta take shots.
[02:35:18.579 --> 02:35:23.520]  And I got him on and said, hey, you know it's not the law to take shots.
[02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:25.101]  You know you should have told him about the waiver.
[02:35:25.121 --> 02:35:28.141]  And he said, oh, you should be a lawyer.
[02:35:28.161 --> 02:35:29.722]  I mean, the interview's out there.
[02:35:31.164 --> 02:35:35.709]  Oh, in fact, now that we know his name, because it's in the film, because I'd forgotten, we had to look it up and find that whole interview.
[02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:36.550]  So it's amazing.
[02:35:36.791 --> 02:35:37.511]  It was on CNN.
[02:35:37.531 --> 02:35:39.654]  They're going, it's the law to take shots, kids crying.
[02:35:39.674 --> 02:35:42.397]  It was shown all over the country to make you think it's the law.
[02:35:43.778 --> 02:35:44.980]  And a total fraud.
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.403]  And I get the guy on, and he's like, yeah, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:35:47.423 --> 02:35:50.005]  I ought to be a lawyer because I know a little bit about reality.
[02:35:51.638 --> 02:35:56.724]  And he's like, yeah, I don't vaccinate my kids and started laughing like it's funny that he knows it's bad.
[02:35:57.024 --> 02:36:03.771]  He doesn't do it to his kids, but he goes out with police standing behind him and goes, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[02:36:03.791 --> 02:36:05.433]  You will take it or you will go to jail.
[02:36:08.359 --> 02:36:15.060]  We tried to get our media people out there to talk to the families lined up with the police dogs and the riot cops, and the police were like, get back, don't talk to them!
[02:36:15.701 --> 02:36:18.721]  So they could engage in a fraud and shoot them up.
[02:36:19.241 --> 02:36:22.742]  Again, does that give you any idea how wicked these governments are?
[02:36:23.142 --> 02:36:24.522]  What else are they lying to you about?
[02:36:24.542 --> 02:36:26.043]  And you bet I get emotional about that.
[02:36:27.123 --> 02:36:32.924]  Because in Nazi Germany, we use that example a lot because that's where it happened, medical tyranny, Soviet Union, same deal.
[02:36:33.922 --> 02:36:40.979]  Going back to our guest, the maker of the documentary film,
[02:36:42.622 --> 02:36:47.364]  The Greater Good, Leslie Manoukian, available at Infowarshop.com.
[02:36:48.004 --> 02:36:51.726]  For ten minutes, I'm going to shut up, because I'll keep asking questions.
[02:36:51.746 --> 02:36:52.647]  You've got the floor.
[02:36:53.247 --> 02:36:54.788]  Why should people see this film?
[02:36:54.988 --> 02:36:56.208]  What will they see in the film?
[02:36:56.608 --> 02:36:58.149]  Who should people show this to?
[02:36:58.930 --> 02:37:00.850]  Can people air it on access television?
[02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:04.012]  I mean, how do they show this to people and save lives?
[02:37:05.131 --> 02:37:08.674]  Well, at this point, it's interesting to me.
[02:37:08.694 --> 02:37:09.334]  We were asked that.
[02:37:09.394 --> 02:37:10.455]  Who's your target audience?
[02:37:10.495 --> 02:37:11.496]  Who do you want to see the film?
[02:37:11.936 --> 02:37:14.458]  We want everybody to see the film.
[02:37:14.818 --> 02:37:20.522]  Because there are somewhere between 200 and 400 vaccines in development right now.
[02:37:21.283 --> 02:37:30.670]  And the vaccine authorities want every man, woman, and child on the planet to have vaccines every year of their life, basically, from cradle to grave.
[02:37:31.170 --> 02:37:32.992]  That's what's being recommended with the flu vaccine.
[02:37:33.032 --> 02:37:34.653]  And there are many others that are coming down the pipe.
[02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:42.953]  So, you know, people often think that, oh, I had my kids, my kids are 10, my kids are 12, they're grown, I don't have to worry about this anymore.
[02:37:43.394 --> 02:37:45.034]  This issue actually affects all of us.
[02:37:45.535 --> 02:37:51.938]  And as you so rightly mentioned early on in the show, neurodegenerative diseases are on the rise.
[02:37:52.158 --> 02:37:54.859]  And not just a little bit, but they're reaching epidemic proportions.
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:38:00.202]  Most adults nowadays, in their elderly years, develop some kind of dementia.
[02:38:00.762 --> 02:38:02.123]  And that's not the way it's always been.
[02:38:03.147 --> 02:38:05.588]  And it's not supposed to be that way.
[02:38:06.128 --> 02:38:17.191]  And so, you know, the reason we made the film is because we wanted to reach everybody and help people to understand that this is an issue they should all care about for their children's health, but also for their own.
[02:38:17.711 --> 02:38:25.613]  But also, very importantly, for them to understand that this issue is not nearly as black and white as they've been told by the mainstream media.
[02:38:27.013 --> 02:38:31.094]  You know, we are constantly told that there's no science showing that vaccines cause any harm.
[02:38:31.809 --> 02:38:43.932]  We're constantly told that there's no evidence that vaccines are linked to autism, asthma, allergies, learning disabilities, speech delays, on and on and on, gut issues, all this stuff, asthma.
[02:38:44.372 --> 02:38:53.655]  And the reality is that I've compiled a document of over a hundred studies, papers, letters to editors and things like that that show that
[02:38:54.540 --> 02:38:57.963]  Vaccines can cause inflammation of the brain and permanent damage.
[02:38:58.363 --> 02:39:01.645]  That they can cause learning disabilities and behavioral problems.
[02:39:02.066 --> 02:39:04.227]  That they can cause immunological problems.
[02:39:04.247 --> 02:39:05.608]  That they can cause gut problems.
[02:39:06.049 --> 02:39:08.751]  That they can cause a whole spectrum of autoimmune diseases.
[02:39:09.571 --> 02:39:30.220]  And as I said earlier, we're not, you know, all this research doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that vaccines are causing all these things, but they certainly are enough to show that we should all have great, great reason for concern and we should all want to figure out what the heck is really going on and whether or not more harm is being done than good by using these vaccines so broadly.
[02:39:31.181 --> 02:39:38.904]  But I think the other really important issue that we raised with the film that I think is so vital for all of us to understand is who should decide what we put into our bodies?
[02:39:39.724 --> 02:39:45.569]  Do you want the government choosing how you keep yourself well, or do you want to make that choice yourself?
[02:39:46.089 --> 02:39:52.194]  And if we don't have the freedom to choose what we inject into our own bodies, into our children's bodies, then are we really free?
[02:39:53.014 --> 02:39:57.017]  It is no secret in science that vaccines injure and kill some people.
[02:39:57.438 --> 02:39:57.998]  No secret.
[02:39:58.899 --> 02:40:06.805]  And given that, how can we possibly yield that right of self-determination to some
[02:40:07.737 --> 02:40:10.858]  Nondescript, faceless bureaucrat in another place.
[02:40:11.138 --> 02:40:14.479]  I just, you know, so this is one of the major issues that we've tried to raise with the film.
[02:40:14.579 --> 02:40:19.901]  It's helping people to understand that vaccines are not candy, that there is a downside.
[02:40:20.521 --> 02:40:30.524]  And to me, Alex, this whole idea that vaccines are candy, that they're just, it's like drinking water, is the reason why those people will line up in Maryland to go and get the shots under threat of imprisonment and fine.
[02:40:31.164 --> 02:40:32.765]  Because they just think there's no downside.
[02:40:32.785 --> 02:40:34.066]  They believe what they've been told.
[02:40:34.546 --> 02:40:39.568]  And so we really hope the film helps people to understand that it's not black and white like you've been told.
[02:40:39.909 --> 02:40:40.989]  It's far more nuanced.
[02:40:41.129 --> 02:40:42.650]  And maybe you'll choose the...
[02:40:46.288 --> 02:40:48.190]  Maybe others will choose they don't want any vaccines.
[02:40:48.691 --> 02:40:58.281]  But the point is that unless you're informed and you really understand what the issues are, what the true long-term health ramifications are, then you're not free to make those choices.
[02:40:58.782 --> 02:41:00.844]  And we need to have that information.
[02:41:02.446 --> 02:41:04.867]  Leslie, you paused there for me to interject.
[02:41:06.048 --> 02:41:20.916]  I've had countless scientists, doctors on, some of them are in your film, and I understand you're trying to sound reasonable here and measured, but I have talked personally on air to more than 500 over the years and to hundreds on the street.
[02:41:21.496 --> 02:41:24.518]  Every time I'm on vacation or something, there's an autistic child
[02:41:25.598 --> 02:41:26.979]  Sitting there, you know, in a pool.
[02:41:27.439 --> 02:41:30.941]  And I'll say, hey, do you mind me asking, when did your son become autistic?
[02:41:31.541 --> 02:41:32.141]  Eighteen months.
[02:41:32.161 --> 02:41:33.722]  He was running around talking, totally happy.
[02:41:33.942 --> 02:41:35.083]  Got the third round of shots.
[02:41:35.123 --> 02:41:37.404]  Had a convulsion in the station wagon driving home.
[02:41:38.384 --> 02:41:40.725]  I know they used to arrest people until this came out.
[02:41:41.146 --> 02:41:44.227]  When they would take the shot and they would collapse, sometimes in the hospital.
[02:41:44.567 --> 02:41:45.848]  They'd say, oh, you must have beaten them.
[02:41:45.868 --> 02:41:48.129]  They had blood on the brain because of an autoimmune response.
[02:41:48.489 --> 02:41:49.770]  They knew full well what they were doing.
[02:41:50.850 --> 02:41:51.270]  They know.
[02:41:51.611 --> 02:41:52.151]  They know.
[02:41:52.171 --> 02:41:54.712]  I mean, the studies are legion.
[02:41:54.732 --> 02:42:03.595]  And then I look at the Rockefellers and the Bill and Melinda Gates who say, get rid of grandma, euthanize people, eugenics, forced abortion.
[02:42:04.235 --> 02:42:06.176]  But, oh, we want you to take shots to live longer.
[02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:06.916]  We care about you.
[02:42:07.957 --> 02:42:11.098]  This is setting a precedent for a very dangerous big pharma
[02:42:12.130 --> 02:42:12.450]  I don't
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:35.180]  Look it up.
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:42.605]  He says we're going to change the diet, diet injections and injunctions so that the public will be sheep-like compared to the ruling elite.
[02:42:43.046 --> 02:42:44.166]  So I've done the study.
[02:42:44.206 --> 02:42:46.908]  My film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covers it.
[02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:49.830]  This is a premeditated program.
[02:42:50.130 --> 02:42:59.056]  You take Bayer Pharmaceutical for 11 years, knew they were shipping HIV, hepatitis, blood to hemophiliacs, and the documents came out, they knew and did it on purpose.
[02:42:59.297 --> 02:43:04.160]  You have chemical, biological, radiological testing on foster children, on troops killing them.
[02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:11.283]  So, who is this in the government that did this, and when they get caught over the last 60 years, they never get in trouble.
[02:43:11.684 --> 02:43:13.244]  They never get in any trouble.
[02:43:14.165 --> 02:43:17.326]  Because, listen, my dad was top of his class in high school.
[02:43:17.887 --> 02:43:20.848]  As a junior, he was in this advanced program.
[02:43:21.328 --> 02:43:32.954]  They called him into the University of Texas, took him behind closed doors, the top testers of 160, I think it was like six of them, and gave them the speech that I'm giving you, but telling him, you're going to be part of this, okay?
[02:43:33.154 --> 02:43:34.495]  And my dad's not that special.
[02:43:34.755 --> 02:43:42.020]  If you're in the top of your class in Texas, or New Mexico, or New York, you're getting this speech today.
[02:43:42.581 --> 02:43:43.741]  That's what I'm telling people.
[02:43:43.821 --> 02:43:47.284]  This is a giant, covert eugenics program.
[02:43:47.564 --> 02:43:49.045]  I know your film doesn't get into that.
[02:43:49.345 --> 02:43:51.046]  You're wanting it to be very balanced.
[02:43:51.066 --> 02:43:52.707]  I think that's why it's the key to get out there.
[02:43:53.268 --> 02:43:54.669]  But any comments on what I'm talking about?
[02:43:56.004 --> 02:44:00.447]  Well, first of all, I think I would just comment that I actually am from the system.
[02:44:00.507 --> 02:44:10.155]  You know, I went to one of the best universities in the nation, and I got an MBA from the University of Chicago, and I worked at Goldman Sachs for a period of years, and then worked in finance for 13 years.
[02:44:10.435 --> 02:44:17.280]  And I witnessed firsthand a lot of overt and some not-so-overt corruption.
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:23.585]  I actually had the CEO of a pharmaceutical company come in and tell me that their blockbuster drug that they were about to
[02:44:24.725 --> 02:44:26.547]  I think the real issue is Alex that
[02:44:47.799 --> 02:44:54.320]  The average person doesn't get that, doesn't understand that, and hasn't connected the dots yet.
[02:44:55.061 --> 02:45:03.262]  And so I come from a place of wanting to educate people and bring them into the fold as easily as I possibly can.
[02:45:03.862 --> 02:45:11.464]  And this is such an emotive issue that if we are too frightening, too frank,
[02:45:12.625 --> 02:45:14.627]  Then I really worry that the message gets lost.
[02:45:15.227 --> 02:45:21.191]  And so, you know, I have a lot of sympathy and appreciation for all the things that you just said.
[02:45:22.752 --> 02:45:40.283]  But I think when it comes to the issue of vaccines, that we will do much more to further the message and bring more people into the fold to understand that they should want to have freedom about what they put in their body and to make these choices than by being more, you know,
[02:45:41.741 --> 02:45:42.761]  Inflammatory, I guess.
[02:45:43.501 --> 02:46:08.727]  And given that we are having a huge impact, there was a report just last week, maybe the week before, that the federal government studied the vaccination rate in Portland, Oregon, and found that in the last five or six years, I forget what the exact period was, but it was in a recent period in the early 2000s, that the non-vaccinators rose from 2.5% of the population to 9.5% of the population.
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:14.344]  No, that was in, I think it was Sacramento B, two days ago.
[02:46:14.845 --> 02:46:19.371]  Yeah, and it's been all over the place for the last couple of weeks, but the place that they studied was Portland, Oregon.
[02:46:19.931 --> 02:46:29.544]  And my point is that that one city has seen the number of people not vaccinating go from two and a half to nine and a half percent in the last several years.
[02:46:30.089 --> 02:46:31.510]  People are starting to wake up to this.
[02:46:32.190 --> 02:46:36.232]  And in order to bring more people in, what we really want to do is change lives.
[02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:38.473]  What we really want to do is wake people up.
[02:46:38.493 --> 02:46:40.234]  What we really want to do is empower people.
[02:46:40.734 --> 02:46:43.295]  And we strongly felt as filmmakers that we do that.
[02:46:44.085 --> 02:46:46.146]  By not beating them over the head, but by helping them.
[02:46:46.166 --> 02:46:46.806]  No, I agree with you.
[02:46:47.206 --> 02:46:48.067]  I mean, I agree with you.
[02:46:48.087 --> 02:46:58.591]  This is something for the Joe Schmoe out there questioning Leslie Mnookin, again, the writer and producer of The Greater Good, available at Infowarshop.com or their site, greatergoodmovie.org.
[02:46:58.931 --> 02:47:00.532]  I can tell you, I've seen the film.
[02:47:01.092 --> 02:47:04.273]  Great filmmaker for somebody that I hadn't done a lot of media before.
[02:47:04.654 --> 02:47:08.255]  I can tell you had a lot of passion for this, and it's a labor of love.
[02:47:09.035 --> 02:47:11.356]  What woke you up to this is a good question.
[02:47:13.746 --> 02:47:17.588]  Well, you know, like I said, I was working on Wall Street for a long time, and I had that experience.
[02:47:17.608 --> 02:47:27.855]  I mean, I headed up Alliance Capital's European Growth Portfolio Management business in London for a period of years, and it was my job to interview CEOs of multinational corporations.
[02:47:28.655 --> 02:47:41.783]  And for many years, I would sort of witness this stuff, but it didn't really hit me until that CEO came in and told me that he was going to do 7 billion in peak sales and kill a bunch of people in the process.
[02:47:42.708 --> 02:47:44.949]  And I just realized that I was playing for the wrong team.
[02:47:45.729 --> 02:47:51.191]  And shortly after that, I met a man in London who told me that vaccines could cause harm.
[02:47:51.491 --> 02:47:53.672]  And I literally thought the guy was nuts.
[02:47:54.192 --> 02:47:55.552]  I said, you know, you're out of your mind.
[02:47:55.612 --> 02:47:57.833]  Vaccines are the greatest invention of humankind.
[02:47:58.774 --> 02:48:00.834]  There's no doubt in my mind that these things are great.
[02:48:01.174 --> 02:48:03.675]  And he said, listen, that's one perspective.
[02:48:03.795 --> 02:48:04.315]  Read this book.
[02:48:04.335 --> 02:48:07.737]  And he gave me Neil Miller's book, Vaccines Are They Really Safe and Effective?
[02:48:08.197 --> 02:48:10.157]  And I read it extremely skeptical.
[02:48:10.197 --> 02:48:11.398]  I'm an analyst by nature.
[02:48:13.042 --> 02:48:22.730]  I was super skeptical, but at the end of the book I went and I looked in the back and there were over 900 footnotes to peer-reviewed medical literature and mainstream news pieces.
[02:48:23.250 --> 02:48:23.691]  And I thought, 900?
[02:48:24.091 --> 02:48:26.693]  Over 900 references?
[02:48:26.833 --> 02:48:27.614]  Can this be true?
[02:48:27.674 --> 02:48:28.355]  Can this be real?
[02:48:29.392 --> 02:48:42.405]  I didn't want to believe it, but I committed to myself right then and there, and this was about 11 years ago, that someday I was going to make a movie on this, and I was going to go and do my own research, read the science myself, and go and look these people in the eyes.
[02:48:42.665 --> 02:48:48.011]  Look CDC and FDA and vaccine developers and patent holders in the eyes and ask them myself,
[02:48:49.033 --> 02:48:50.113]  What's really going on here?
[02:48:50.634 --> 02:48:53.815]  And you've done that, and they look scared when you're talking to them.
[02:48:53.835 --> 02:48:55.416]  You've hit a home run, the greater good.
[02:48:55.736 --> 02:48:57.517]  Again, get this out to everybody.
[02:48:57.797 --> 02:48:59.237]  In a little bit of time we've got left.
[02:48:59.277 --> 02:49:00.538]  I want to go back though, because...
[02:49:02.324 --> 02:49:08.769]  I'm guessing, because I've had experiences similar to this, where you thought, oh, he's joking, I'm going to make $7 billion and kill a bunch of people.
[02:49:08.809 --> 02:49:12.231]  But I've interviewed genetic engineers who are making $3 million a year.
[02:49:12.471 --> 02:49:16.534]  They're like, hey, this potato is sterilizing the rats, but we're getting it approved?
[02:49:17.054 --> 02:49:18.896]  And they're like, yeah, there's too many people.
[02:49:19.396 --> 02:49:20.757]  That's really the plan.
[02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:23.499]  And then they think it's a joke, but then it gets approved.
[02:49:23.959 --> 02:49:27.101]  I mean, do you think he was joking when he said, I'm going to make $7 billion and kill people?
[02:49:27.542 --> 02:49:30.764]  Or did you go do research and realize it wasn't really a joke?
[02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:42.256]  I realized that all that mattered to him was corporate profits, and that that is really what is the driver of everything in the world today.
[02:49:42.316 --> 02:49:57.587]  I mean, I guess I've gotten to the point where I recognize that there is no separation between state and the corporate world anymore, and that the only way that we are going to change that is if average citizens stand up and hold their ground.
[02:49:58.431 --> 02:50:17.978]  And this was the first step for me in that process, making this film to empower people so that they could stand up for themselves, so that they could go to the lobby in California and say, we're not going to support this bill that they've got in front of California now that will require every person to get a vaccine exemption from an authorized medical provider every single year.
[02:50:17.998 --> 02:50:26.581]  You know, I just, I recognize that this guy was just delusional, but that not just he was delusional, but so were all the other people who were
[02:50:28.082 --> 02:50:31.783]  Well, listen, Leslie Manoukian, you've hit a home run.
[02:50:31.803 --> 02:50:33.543]  I want to get you back on the nightly news.
[02:50:33.583 --> 02:50:38.284]  We can do uninterrupted, long interview or anybody else you want to invite and get you up on Skype.
[02:50:38.684 --> 02:50:39.945]  Great job with the greater good.
[02:50:40.025 --> 02:50:40.585]  God bless you.
[02:50:40.625 --> 02:50:47.446]  And with people like you out there, we're going to defeat this tyranny because the special interest coming in now, being able to lobby to make us take the products.
[02:50:47.826 --> 02:50:48.607]  It's true tyranny.
[02:50:48.867 --> 02:50:50.007]  Thank you so much for your work.
[02:50:51.391 --> 02:50:52.211]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:50:52.231 --> 02:50:52.851]  I am so grateful.
[02:50:53.092 --> 02:50:54.032]  No, we're grateful to you.
[02:50:54.052 --> 02:50:55.552]  A lot of children to save.

[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:04.121]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:54:04.141 --> 02:54:08.686]  I'm going to start going to your phone calls for about 20-30 minutes for those that have been holding.
[02:54:08.706 --> 02:54:16.395]  I want to hear from you, all the interesting points you raise, and then I'll continue back into the latest on Fast and Furious, and it is big.
[02:54:16.435 --> 02:54:17.696]  This is shaping up.
[02:54:17.716 --> 02:54:19.718]  They may actually bring Obama to justice.
[02:54:20.902 --> 02:54:23.644]  We'll also get into what's happening with the economy.
[02:54:24.124 --> 02:54:38.495]  That's probably the most important area, but the greater good available at Infowarshop.com is so important, and hopefully you'll show it to people in your area, put it on AXS TV, things like that, because, you know, it's very well produced, made for a mainline audience.
[02:54:39.896 --> 02:54:43.439]  It's not as hardcore as total reality, but people aren't ready for that.
[02:54:44.319 --> 02:54:45.080]  In many cases.
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:46.661]  There's different schools of thought.
[02:54:46.761 --> 02:54:49.503]  Slapping folks upside the head seems to work, but whatever.
[02:54:49.563 --> 02:54:52.665]  I think this friendly approach is also good.
[02:54:53.185 --> 02:54:56.628]  We also have Dreams From My Real Father, Joel Gilbert.
[02:54:57.188 --> 02:55:03.473]  This film isn't even out yet, but we're able to sell it before it's out officially, and we're the only folks, by the way, that actually have it in stock.
[02:55:04.293 --> 02:55:05.574]  Because it's so hot right now.
[02:55:06.035 --> 02:55:16.542]  It's available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase funds this whole news organization, the radio show, the nightly news, the films, the news websites, everything we're doing and all the new reporters we're hiring.
[02:55:17.103 --> 02:55:21.766]  Tomorrow I'm going to announce the male and female reporter winners and $10,000 in prizes.
[02:55:22.347 --> 02:55:32.395]  And you got two more weeks, or a week and a half down for phase two, $10,000 in prizes for the Obama dictator contest, hanging up posters in legal lawful areas.
[02:55:33.075 --> 02:55:35.396]  Find out more at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:36.716 --> 02:55:39.797]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Georgia.
[02:55:39.857 --> 02:55:40.577]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:41.137 --> 02:55:41.498]  Welcome.
[02:55:41.518 --> 02:55:42.658]  What'd you think of that last guest?
[02:55:44.038 --> 02:55:44.578]  She was awesome.
[02:55:44.839 --> 02:55:46.479]  She was awesome.
[02:55:46.739 --> 02:55:48.880]  Just first off, I want to appreciate you for everything you do, man.
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:50.040]  You're a true patriot.
[02:55:51.861 --> 02:55:52.721]  Got a quick question for you.
[02:55:52.761 --> 02:56:02.544]  I know it's going to be kind of a difficult one to answer, but with things speeding up the way they are, how much longer do you feel like we have before the globalists are going to implement a full-scale collapse?
[02:56:03.988 --> 02:56:11.924]  Well, many areas like Greece have already collapsed into total bedlam, about six months, a year.
[02:56:14.295 --> 02:56:20.137]  The globalists won't do this right away, or they'll back off a little if they don't think we're going to go along with it.
[02:56:20.437 --> 02:56:26.619]  But everywhere where they think they've got their people in place, like Spain and Greece and other areas, they're going to drop the hammer all the way.
[02:56:26.639 --> 02:56:27.799]  I mean, they hate the public.
[02:56:27.839 --> 02:56:28.919]  They want to impoverish.
[02:56:28.939 --> 02:56:32.741]  That's their stated eugenicist post-industrial view.
[02:56:36.107 --> 02:56:40.068]  In fact, I'm going to cover that coming up after calls, but I mean, it's the banks are getting ready.
[02:56:40.448 --> 02:56:47.330]  The big mega banks that are just fronts for the private interest that own them, they're getting ready to bring down the zombie banks.
[02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:57.433]  And when that happens, when Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and other Ponzi scheme shell corporations are blown, it is going to be, it's going to make
[02:56:58.883 --> 02:57:02.906]  Right now, it's 50-50 that it's going to be road warrior level depression.
[02:57:03.186 --> 02:57:06.128]  We're already in a depression, but it's a slow sliding one.
[02:57:06.809 --> 02:57:10.471]  From recession into depression, and of course, that's on the good side.
[02:57:11.452 --> 02:57:17.537]  It is, I mean, now all the main analysts are saying, you better give us everything or we're going to give you a total depression.
[02:57:17.557 --> 02:57:21.079]  Well, we've already given them everything, but their plan is the depression.
[02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:24.281]  So, I mean, look at this article out of CNBC.
[02:57:24.341 --> 02:57:27.584]  Big banks craft living wills in case they fail.
[02:57:29.062 --> 02:57:29.783]  And then here's another one.
[02:57:29.843 --> 02:57:31.365]  Avoiding a global catastrophe.
[02:57:31.425 --> 02:57:35.349]  Larry Summers, who helped engineer all this, and he talks about things completely melting down.
[02:57:35.669 --> 02:57:50.084]  Well, I mean, it's mathematically impossible, unless we write off the trillion, the 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion, even hard to say that number, unless we write all that off, and unless we explain that's not our debt and arrest all these people,
[02:57:50.825 --> 02:58:02.455]  They're going to bring us into total global collapse that they're going to organize and pose as saviors with a prostitute, Decepticon, collaborator, Vichy French media telling us they're the saviors.
[02:58:03.436 --> 02:58:07.339]  And it is going to get absolutely hellish with staged terror attacks, new wars.
[02:58:07.639 --> 02:58:08.921]  They're going to throw everything at us.
[02:58:09.261 --> 02:58:11.363]  They have been massing basically on our border.
[02:58:12.284 --> 02:58:15.586]  The New World Order has, in every city, every town, against us.
[02:58:15.646 --> 02:58:30.515]  They are surveilling us, they are trying to create attack forces, death squads, and they are just building up the armored bunkers, the pillboxes, the machine guns, the shotguns, the hollow point ammo, the drones, for all out war against us.
[02:58:31.376 --> 02:58:33.977]  And let me tell you, they're gonna get their butts kicked.
[02:58:36.739 --> 02:58:38.440]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:46.052 --> 02:58:50.293]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:50.593 --> 02:58:50.873]  Number 1.
[02:58:51.514 --> 02:58:54.674]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:54.935 --> 02:58:55.495]  Number 2.
[02:58:55.795 --> 02:59:00.336]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:00.696 --> 02:59:01.136]  It's true.
[02:59:01.436 --> 02:59:05.998]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:06.298 --> 02:59:06.838]  Number 3.
[02:59:07.118 --> 02:59:10.399]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:10.699 --> 02:59:14.380]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:14.620 --> 02:59:15.160]  Number 4.
[02:59:15.420 --> 02:59:17.781]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:18.181 --> 02:59:21.542]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:21.863 --> 02:59:22.063]  Number 5.
[02:59:22.643 --> 02:59:26.564]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:26.784 --> 02:59:31.546]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
