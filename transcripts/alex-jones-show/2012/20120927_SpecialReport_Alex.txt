[00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.036]  Enough is enough!
[00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:05.582]  Enough is enough!
[00:00:08.027 --> 00:00:08.547]  As the U.S.
[00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:14.808]  economy continues to falter, a growing number of Americans are primarily blaming the Federal Reserve for the downturn.
[00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:26.231]  Recently, thousands of Americans gathered at various Federal Reserve locations nationwide to draw attention to this organization's polarizing practices as part of the National End the Fed Rally.
[00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:37.513]  In San Antonio, over 50 protesters participated in the event, which included a half-mile march from the Federal Reserve Building to the Alamo, where literature was then handed out to members of the public.
[00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:51.346]  Well, the Federal Reserve has devalued the dollar 95% since its birth in 1913, and it continues to print money out thin air, not backing it by any metal, like gold or silver, like it should be, and that continues to devalue our dollar.
[00:00:52.127 --> 00:01:05.051]  A partial audit of the Fed in July of 2011 showed $16 trillion in banker bailouts across the world, and the American people never got to vote on this, and this was only a partial audit of the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:07.252]  I wonder what a full one would turn out.
[00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:13.758]  President Woodrow Wilson stated that creating the Federal Reserve was a decision he greatly regretted.
[00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.844]  Currently, Ron Paul's Audit the Fed bill is in the Senate and has over 30 co-sponsors.
[00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:29.095]  However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has surprisingly stated he will not put the bill up for a vote despite the fact that in past years he has heavily criticized the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.621]  President Barack Obama rarely, if ever, talks about this issue.
[00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:36.588]  However, Mitt Romney has stated he does support the Audit the Fed bill.
[00:01:37.048 --> 00:01:42.698]  Now, do you think the Republicans will keep their promise to Audit the Fed and reintroduce the gold standard if elected?
[00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:47.827]  Seeing what they did in Tampa and what they did at our state convention, that they're not going to keep any promises.
[00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:53.009]  So if they somehow miraculously do get elected as president, they will not keep that promise.
[00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:58.950]  I mean, if you look at somebody like our governor, who's a Republican, Rick Perry, he says one thing and does another.
[00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.271]  I mean, he may say constitution and liberty in a speech, but when it comes down to TSA and touching my daughter, he's all for it.
[00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:07.392]  So I doubt, I highly doubt they will get elected.
[00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:10.073]  And I know for a fact, they will not keep that promise.
[00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:13.542]  Now, what are your thoughts on the fact that the media doesn't cover this event?
[00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:44.058]  I think it's not surprising but you know we did have coverage 2008-2009 we had local media out here for in the Fed rallies and they really did a good job of portraying us and then around that time the audit the Fed bill actually does pass the house and the media hasn't really come out since the local media hasn't really covered it so I think because you know the public is starting to make a difference is starting to make a headway and getting the Federal Reserve audited and possibly end it so I don't think they really want to help that grassroots movement grow any more than it already is.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.144]  A Rasmussen poll taken earlier this year revealed that 50% of those questioned are confident in the U.S.
[00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:55.067]  banking system, while 47% lack confidence in the system.
[00:02:55.787 --> 00:03:03.893]  Another poll taken earlier this year revealed, however, that 58% of Americans believe the Fed will not be able to keep inflation under control.
[00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:08.816]  According to protesters, it is important that citizens continue drawing attention to this cause.
[00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:17.894]  And then also the process of educating the public and informing the public when the Federal Reserve really is, is really beneficial because then it just adds more people who are going to put the pressure on the government.
[00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:21.996]  And you know, it's a process the New World Order uses, pressure from above and pressure from below.
[00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:28.099]  And we've got to use those tactics in our move to end the New World Order to fight back this Illuminati banker scheme.
[00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.600]  We have to use pressure from above and pressure from below.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.504]  And I think by understanding that we can make a difference and defeat this New World Order and cut it at the root with the Federal Reserve.
