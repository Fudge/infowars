[00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:05.311]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:07.032]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:09.033]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:10.353]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.113 --> 00:00:12.074]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.275]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.279]  Get ready!
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.441]  Kick-off just took place.
[00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:43.903]  We are live.
[00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:47.046]  It is Wednesday, the 15th day of August 2012.
[00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:53.011]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:54.273]  And guess who's coming on today?
[00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:58.428]  John Rocker, he's a writer for World Net Daily.
[00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.732]  You know him as a former top professional baseball player plagued by scandal.
[00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:16.164]  And when I was up covering Bilderberg a few months ago in Virginia, I'd already been following his writing, but I thought it sounded like a cogent, intelligent person compared to the way the media had construed and twisted and exaggerated what he'd said.
[00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:17.465]  And they said, really?
[00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:20.047]  Well, it's funny you notice his writing because he's a listener of yours.
[00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.068]  I would love to come on the show.
[00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:35.074]  So, John Rocker, I guess he's probably tuning in right now, he's going to be joining us for his maiden visit with us, and we'll talk about what he really stands for, not what the media has said John Rocker stands for.
[00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:38.255]  I got a copy of his book around here, they gave me one, I read it, it was pretty darn good.
[00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.316]  So we're going to be talking about that as well.
[00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:41.916]  JohnRocker.net is his website.
[00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:47.879]  I, of course, am Alex Jones of Infowars.com, so retired American Major League Baseball
[00:01:48.854 --> 00:02:00.480]  Relief pitcher, played for the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, as well as Long Island Ducks, the Independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, through left-handed and batted right-handed.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.602]  He'll be joining us today to talk about, well, he said, what do you want to talk about?
[00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.123]  He said, I want to talk about the TSA.
[00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:10.565]  And boy, there's a lot of news on that front, so we'll be discussing it.
[00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.853]  That said, then we have a special guest, hadn't been on in a while, but backed by popular demand, talk show host and compounding pharmacist, Ben Fuchs.
[00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:28.536]  And I do not intend to belabor a bunch of longevity products that I believe are the best that are available at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:30.016]  He is going to join us.
[00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:31.437]  We've done research for this interview.
[00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:36.899]  I have done research because I listen to his show, some that comes on right before mine on GCN, GCNlive.com.
[00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:47.968]  And a syndicated getting on a lot of stations and I heard him the other day just going through all the vitamins and minerals and reading what scientists admit it causes if you have a deficiency.
[00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:57.055]  Pancreas going out, diabetes, cancer, skin problems, hair falling out.
[00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:57.916]  I mean just all of it.
[00:02:57.936 --> 00:02:59.998]  We're gonna go through a blitzkrieg
[00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:01.789]  In the third hour.
[00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.092]  I mean, I'm going to just sit here like I did with Tarpley last night for an hour and 30 minutes.
[00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:10.216]  He talked about 70% of the time and just let him roll with the info on the economy and more.
[00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:17.363]  That video's up at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, but the point is, I'm going to try to just sit back and have him rapid-fire roll through this.
[00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:20.606]  Because I want to know more, and I know you want to know more.
[00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:22.868]  And I'm going to ask him questions like, L.A.
[00:03:22.908 --> 00:03:26.871]  Times, no yolk eating the whole egg as dangerous as smoking.
[00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:27.092]  See?
[00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:35.144]  It sounds reasonable to ban smoking or put incredible taxes on it, but the globalists don't care about us.
[00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:50.840]  They push illegal, corrupt drugs on us, dangerous drugs, vaccines, but they get something like, smoking the UN said 30 years ago, they would globally standardize a demonization campaign, and I understand why, it's really bad for you, especially the additives, and then set the precedent.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.123]  It's like the precedent with toilets or light bulbs, and then pretty soon there's home inspectors in your house, and pretty soon you can't have dust in the barn, so they shut down the family farm.
[00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:07.044]  You know, child labor laws sound good until they ban you having your 10-year-old carry out the garbage, which they've done in areas of Europe.
[00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:10.585]  And your kids divorce you because the state tells them to on television.
[00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:13.826]  So this is what's going on, the breakup of the family.
[00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:18.228]  There's all these big moves to outright ban cigarettes.
[00:04:18.248 --> 00:04:19.228]  You'll just make a black market.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.481]  Or bring it to the point of where a package is $20.
[00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:34.165]  They want this controlled because they want to start, it's already started in New York, outright bans of large 16 ounce and above drinks and things and salt and all the rest of it.
[00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:36.306]  $2,000 fines if you put salt in food.
[00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:37.566]  I'm not joking.
[00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.287]  This is the control freak model.
[00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:40.627]  It's not that it's an anti-state loves you.
[00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:41.707]  They want to control you.
[00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:43.488]  Next is going to be eggs.
[00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:51.513]  All the cashless society face-scanning to buy and sell will mark what you're eating.
[00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:53.655]  You'll be given a surcharge for it.
[00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:54.576]  That's the plan.
[00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:57.400]  It's coming, just like black boxes in your cars.
[00:04:57.841 --> 00:04:58.622]  Big news coming up.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.622]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[00:05:03.882 --> 00:05:09.467]  It is a nano-catalytic silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:12.909]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.495]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:27.559]  Silversol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.623]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[00:05:34.123 --> 00:05:40.907]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:43.448]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:46.490]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:08.940]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.545]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:06:15.746 --> 00:06:21.170]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.093]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:28.817]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:33.462]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:35.984]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:39.728]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.313]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:47.096]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:53.922]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:58.946]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:02.890]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water?
[00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.831]  Bathing as you get sick and die?
[00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:07.274]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:13.019]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.442]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.805]  It's filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:21.487]  There's no priming required.
[00:07:21.747 --> 00:07:23.769]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.491]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:28.913]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:30.394]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:33.356]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:36.839]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:41.062]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:43.803]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:07:43.944 --> 00:07:45.265]  It's what my family uses.
[00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:48.727]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:05.117]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:07.778]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:31.911]  Well, strap yourselves in, my friends, for this Wednesday, the 15th day of August 2012 broadcast.
[00:08:32.572 --> 00:08:43.863]  Controversial figure, WorldNet Daily writer, retired professional baseball player, author John Rocker is going to be joining us to talk about the TSA and more in the second hour today.
[00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:48.137]  And I guess it's back with popular demand.
[00:08:48.177 --> 00:09:04.467]  We're going to race through different vitamin and mineral deficiencies just covering the waterfront and why so many diseases are exploding off the charts and why the medical system doesn't want you to know that it is being caused by mainly mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiencies.
[00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:08.849]  So that's in the third hour today with compounding pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:11.271]  And I do intend to also try to take some phone calls.
[00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.893]  But time will race through with both of those guests, obviously.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:26.509]  That said, Paul Watson is working on a story that is going to break in the next 15 to 20 minutes at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.073]  If you go to the DrudgeReport.com right now,
[00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:34.116]  Two of our stories are top stories.
[00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:35.637]  One of them was the top story yesterday.
[00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:37.659]  It's now gone down the left-hand side.
[00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:40.882]  The other is the top story on the right-hand side.
[00:09:41.302 --> 00:09:44.525]  Now Social Security Administration to purchase 174,000 rounds of bullets.
[00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:44.766]  Of ammo.
[00:09:52.338 --> 00:09:55.160]  That is an Infowars.com Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.301]  Now Paul is hot on the case of this.
[00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:01.044]  Last year it was 250 million rounds of 40 cal alone.
[00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:05.207]  This year, five months ago, 450 million rounds made big news.
[00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:14.393]  Now, last Friday, and we noticed it Sunday, did an article Monday that again went national because Drudge linked to it, they purchased
[00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:26.393]  750 million rounds, then it came out the National Weather Service per office was ordering 15,000 to 25,000 per office.
[00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:31.355]  We're talking basically every major city has got a National Weather Service in it.
[00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:40.558]  Now, this morning, because these orders are coming in so fast on top of the 1.4 billion in less than 12 months.
[00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:49.789]  It was what the 250 million round purchase was made in September of last year.
[00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:51.910]  So 11 months ago.
[00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.231]  250 mil, 450 mil, 750 mil.
[00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.692]  And now they're breaking the orders up in 200,000, 300,000, 174,000.
[00:10:54.872 --> 00:10:57.253]  Now they're flooding in and guess what happened?
[00:10:57.273 --> 00:10:58.494]  This is breaking in the next 20 minutes.
[00:10:58.514 --> 00:10:59.194]  Homeland Security illegally
[00:11:11.482 --> 00:11:33.446]  With new purchase orders yesterday, because they know under federal law, unless mandated by Congress and the National Security Council in consultation with the National Security Committee in the House of Representatives and the Senate, if they don't have authorization and a mandate from Congress, they cannot classify something.
[00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:43.543]  Homeland Security has now blacked out new orders for more ammo on top of the 1.4 bill that went out yesterday.
[00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:45.344]  Watson is in there every morning.
[00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.147]  He's working at 2 a.m.
[00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.491]  our time because he's in England six hours ahead of Central.
[00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:56.316]  So when I'm sawing logs at 6 a.m., Watson's already up.
[00:11:57.157 --> 00:11:59.259]  And they have now blacked it out.
[00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:01.706]  In the purchase orders.
[00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:03.287]  You can go to the federal government websites.
[00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.729]  By law, they have to list the open contracts there.
[00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.090]  It's not classified.
[00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.132]  In fact, it's not even listed restricted.
[00:12:10.655 --> 00:12:17.000]  And it lists that they put these bids out and that they're making these purchases and they blacked it out.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.942]  And ladies and gentlemen, he's got screenshots of it all.
[00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:25.906]  It's so ham-fisted that they didn't run it through a machine that blacked it out like the CIA.
[00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.527]  They used black markers.
[00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:28.728]  We blew it up.
[00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:30.450]  You can read what it is.
[00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.570]  They can't.
[00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.192]  These lazy people.
[00:12:34.515 --> 00:12:40.158]  Are too out of control, criminal-wise, to even black it out.
[00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:41.638]  By the way, it's illegal.
[00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:44.299]  And I've got, I looked it up, Watson's adding that to his article.
[00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:47.241]  He had a consultational talk before I went live on air today.
[00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.722]  And I went and looked it up from my memory.
[00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:52.563]  It's not a congressional mandate.
[00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.784]  That's why it's put on that public bid process.
[00:12:55.164 --> 00:12:56.084]  That's why it's listed.
[00:12:56.304 --> 00:12:57.285]  They have illegally
[00:12:58.416 --> 00:12:59.196]  Black this out.
[00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:12.260]  Now, don't expect Congress to take them to the woodshed for it, but Watson has now found some of these National Endowment groups for Democracy and others connected to these ammo purchases and now we know why they're getting so many.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.260]  Watson is ferreting this out right now.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.581]  This is not confirmed, but we have the linkage.
[00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:26.494]  It appears a large portion of the 1.4 million plus is being shipped to Turkey and then into Syria.
[00:13:26.854 --> 00:13:28.475]  So the bullets are going to Al-Qaeda!
[00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:33.403]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:13:33.824 --> 00:13:37.625]  It's an Iran conference situation by Hillary over there.
[00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:40.266]  And that's why they're blacking out these bullets.
[00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:40.826]  It doesn't matter.
[00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:53.230]  I tell you, man, it's fast and furious where they ship 20,000 guns, hand grenades, not just to Mexico, but to Honduras and inside the U.S., Chicago, Illinois, Indianapolis, Indiana, Tampa, Florida.
[00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:55.871]  Yeah, they ship guns there too.
[00:13:58.147 --> 00:14:00.408]  To gangs that are killing gangs they want to knock out.
[00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:01.930]  I mean, these are just mafia people.
[00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.251]  I shouldn't be sitting around laughing at them.
[00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:07.834]  I can feel the wings of the angel of death flapping around.
[00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:09.836]  I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for God and your prayers.
[00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:12.578]  And by the way, I just want to say that here today.
[00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:15.060]  I am so incredibly thankful that I was ever born.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.702]  I'm so incredibly thankful to my family, to my wife, my children, and their courage.
[00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:25.188]  I'm so incredibly thankful to you, the listeners and supporters, and people that have supported us in the media.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:34.575]  Out there, talk show host, webmasters, journalist, for putting up with us, because everybody knows we're not perfect, but we're real.
[00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:35.797]  We try the best we can.
[00:14:35.837 --> 00:14:36.677]  We try to tell the truth.
[00:14:36.717 --> 00:14:37.518]  We try to be accurate.
[00:14:37.738 --> 00:14:40.781]  We have a really good track record compared to the mainstream media that tries to lie.
[00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:45.645]  That I have lived a full and great life, and I feel successful.
[00:14:46.306 --> 00:14:52.091]  I feel a life of worth and of value, and I don't have any fear.
[00:14:53.086 --> 00:14:54.928]  Because I know I'm on the right path.
[00:14:54.948 --> 00:14:55.809]  I know I'm on the right course.
[00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:58.011]  And I hope I'm alive to be 100 years old.
[00:14:58.071 --> 00:14:58.651]  I love life.
[00:14:59.472 --> 00:15:01.134]  I just love my dogs.
[00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:03.916]  Watching them eat and jump around and sit in my lap.
[00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:05.838]  I love my children, watching them learn.
[00:15:05.858 --> 00:15:09.202]  I just love my family.
[00:15:09.282 --> 00:15:10.082]  I love goodness.
[00:15:11.123 --> 00:15:15.307]  And I love truthfulness and straightforwardness and uprightness.
[00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:19.435]  Um, doesn't mean I'm up on some high horse myself.
[00:15:19.495 --> 00:15:23.096]  I recognize my slovenliness and worldliness and all the rest of it.
[00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:30.858]  I just, being honorable and being good and being strong and not being afraid is so fulfilling.
[00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:33.079]  It is so fulfilling.
[00:15:34.592 --> 00:15:37.774]  To go through all the tribulations we face and know that more are coming.
[00:15:38.314 --> 00:15:39.414]  It's just fulfilling.
[00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:44.957]  The worst things that have happened to me in my life when I'm doing the right thing, it is always a lesson.
[00:15:45.037 --> 00:15:45.817]  It is fulfilling.
[00:15:46.337 --> 00:15:48.278]  And it's not like, oh, I'm the poor victim.
[00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:49.199]  I feel sorry for myself.
[00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:50.199]  It's the opposite.
[00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.740]  It's the strength of the species.
[00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:58.043]  It's the communing with my ancestors, the ones that were straight and strong and did the right thing.
[00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:00.830]  And lifted up the species.
[00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:01.711]  It is, it is.
[00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:03.513]  You see, I'm an individualist.
[00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:05.695]  The globalists are counterfeiters.
[00:16:06.035 --> 00:16:08.578]  They try to create a counterfeit of what's already there.
[00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:09.939]  We are individuals.
[00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:18.807]  But individually, in our basic code of honor, in our basic understanding of what's wholesome and good, we are communal.
[00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:19.828]  We are collective.
[00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:22.010]  But it's not a forced collective.
[00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:29.549]  It is an individual's through shared beliefs and ideas and passion and souls that are similar.
[00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:41.017]  We commune with those in the past because there's a connection, mother to son, father to daughter, father to son, just down.
[00:16:42.798 --> 00:16:51.023]  In the last 6,000 years of recorded history, there's only been 60 real generations.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.641]  You ever think about that?
[00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:56.043]  And so that's not that long ago, is it?
[00:16:57.184 --> 00:17:04.610]  And so that person, you know, your great-grandparent, even if you never met them, they took care of your grandparents who had your parents who had you.
[00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.152]  There's a direct electrical connection.
[00:17:07.632 --> 00:17:09.273]  And this isn't even really a spiritual thing.
[00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:10.975]  It's a genetic thing.
[00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:16.959]  It's a consciousness archetypal race memory.
[00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:17.960]  That's what instincts are.
[00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:26.473]  I let my children go see Brave because they're thinking about doing an analysis of it.
[00:17:27.174 --> 00:17:28.555]  I'm thinking about putting my children on TV.
[00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:29.715]  They want to go on air.
[00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:33.518]  They want to, you know, even though that's dangerous, they have a desire to do it.
[00:17:33.538 --> 00:17:34.918]  I think I'm going to let them take the risk.
[00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:36.940]  That's what life's all about.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.102]  And I said, okay, go watch this movie and do a review with your mother, the two older ones.
[00:17:42.443 --> 00:17:45.325]  And my kids don't get scared of hardly anything, but there's a big evil bear in it.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.342]  And it's occultic and stuff as well, druidic.
[00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:52.125]  And my daughter came over and said, man, that really scared me, that big bear.
[00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:59.911]  And that's because, instinctively, our ancestors dealt with big, mean cave bears.
[00:18:00.952 --> 00:18:02.273]  Twice the size of a grizzly bear.
[00:18:03.714 --> 00:18:06.617]  And so, instinctively, that's why when you come out of your house at night,
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.881]  When you come out of your house, it's like coming out of your cave.
[00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:14.002]  That's where big animals, big predators used to wait to eat us.
[00:18:14.642 --> 00:18:16.662]  That's why you feel fear coming out of your house.
[00:18:16.682 --> 00:18:19.943]  That's why going in and out of a threshold, because that's where something's going to be waiting.
[00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:22.344]  All of that is really racial memories.
[00:18:22.964 --> 00:18:30.106]  And it is satisfying in the human race to connect and do the right thing as our forebearers did.
[00:18:31.164 --> 00:18:39.089]  And then we are an example of those that come in the future and that's when everything clicks into position and that's when you become satisfied.
[00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:53.904]  So many people are not satisfied because you're not going to find satisfaction in sports, you're not going to find it in sex, you're not going to find it in being a tough guy, you're not going to find it in any of those things.
[00:18:54.224 --> 00:19:02.912]  I mean, sure, there's a place for all of it, but when you think that's the center of your universe and that you're going to find fulfillment just in that, that is not the case.
[00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:08.537]  The great dedications are where you're going to find satisfaction.
[00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:11.299]  And the defense of the innocent.
[00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.460]  We are winning.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.601]  All the polls are out there.
[00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:15.462]  We're winning the fight for the Second Amendment.
[00:19:16.082 --> 00:19:18.264]  We're winning the fight against abortion worldwide.
[00:19:18.464 --> 00:19:19.304]  They're freaking out.
[00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:23.247]  Young people, it's off the chart, despite the programming you're turning against.
[00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:25.909]  Because they're teaching them that abortion's wonderful.
[00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:27.330]  Kids know how to rebel.
[00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.812]  It's built in, in case you've got bad people.
[00:19:30.552 --> 00:19:37.356]  The truth is, young people don't really rebel if you teach them to become leaders and chiefs in their own area.
[00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:46.681]  If you put them in danger, if you challenge them, if you put them out there and treat them as adults, they will never rebel against you.
[00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:53.805]  Because by the time they get to the age to rebel, they're 13, 14, they're already men and women, they're already ready to be men and women.
[00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:56.446]  They only rebel when you suppress them.
[00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:59.708]  They only rebel when you don't turn them into adults!
[00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.533]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:12.676]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:14.717]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:20:15.177 --> 00:20:22.461]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:20:22.961 --> 00:20:26.263]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:20:26.663 --> 00:20:30.525]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.

[00:22:38.254 --> 00:22:38.995]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.055 --> 00:22:45.199]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.140]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:25:04.394 --> 00:25:09.096]  I've got something a little light-hearted we're going to play when we come back from the break.
[00:25:09.136 --> 00:25:10.416]  I've never aired it before.
[00:25:11.517 --> 00:25:12.417]  It is satire.
[00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:14.258]  You will notice that right away.
[00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:20.421]  And we're going to post the video of it if you're a radio listener and want to follow along, you can go there and watch it.
[00:25:21.723 --> 00:25:29.126]  It is a new presidential candidate that has announced that they're running for 2012 on a third party ticket.
[00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:32.467]  Yes, that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.928]  It's about 8-9 minutes long.
[00:25:35.588 --> 00:25:37.429]  Then I will continue with the news.
[00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:42.030]  But Watson soon will have an article that is not satire, unfortunately, up.
[00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:54.890]  This fits the pattern of Fast and Furious, the 1.4 billion rounds of ammo, because now they're ordering millions of rounds of ammo in combat rounds.
[00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.292]  .308, .223, but also .357 Magnum, .357 Sig, .38s, everything!
[00:26:06.608 --> 00:26:13.991]  And it looks like what you'd give a ragtag army that's got a bunch of different governments like NATO, consortium, giving them weapons.
[00:26:14.451 --> 00:26:16.212]  And again, Watson is ferreting into that.
[00:26:16.272 --> 00:26:17.572]  I hope other journalists look into it.
[00:26:17.853 --> 00:26:21.314]  His new article coming out just deals with, they're now blacking it out.
[00:26:21.674 --> 00:26:30.818]  On top of the 1.4 billion and change bullets of the last year, or 11 months to be technical, again, 1 billion this year.
[00:26:32.338 --> 00:26:34.979]  250 mil and 750 mil.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.800]  One bill.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.401]  One billion bullets bought.
[00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:38.861]  Now they're buying a bunch of others.
[00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:40.322]  The Post Office.
[00:26:41.722 --> 00:26:43.723]  The Social Security Administration.
[00:26:44.224 --> 00:26:45.824]  The Department of Education.
[00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:51.447]  The National Weather Service.
[00:26:52.087 --> 00:26:52.487]  NOAA.
[00:26:52.967 --> 00:26:55.669]  That is over the Fish and Wildlife, the federal folks.
[00:26:56.169 --> 00:27:00.591]  I mean, you would think they were getting ready to fight a trillion Martians landing or something.
[00:27:01.542 --> 00:27:03.963]  And again, some of the spin is, oh, we always buy ammo.
[00:27:04.284 --> 00:27:05.725]  Really, we looked up the numbers.
[00:27:05.745 --> 00:27:12.549]  This is at least ten times what all federal law enforcement has ever bought.
[00:27:12.849 --> 00:27:15.110]  In fact, I've got my researchers putting that article together.
[00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.572]  It'll be out in the next few days, but we've found some of the numbers.
[00:27:17.592 --> 00:27:27.978]  I mean, in the past, they might have bought, might have bought a million rounds of ammo for the entire FBI.
[00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:33.869]  In a year, I mean, and that's a lot for target shooting and all the things they're doing and what they have.
[00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:43.297]  There were cases where total non-military, we're talking about 50, 60, 70 million rounds getting bought in a year.
[00:27:43.677 --> 00:27:49.202]  We're talking about a billion, so when I say 10 times, it's way over that.
[00:27:49.442 --> 00:27:52.745]  And again, there are hundreds and hundreds.
[00:27:53.886 --> 00:27:55.187]  The last purchase I saw was over 300.
[00:27:56.934 --> 00:28:00.158]  Last year, and they finally got delivered the last few months, that's why you're seeing them everywhere.
[00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:10.749]  First on the back of trucks and trains, big giant black war wagons are, you know, that have a Homeland Security seal on them, and they're giving them to local police.
[00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:16.055]  These aren't old army vehicles that are surplus, you know, for the SWAT team to roll up in a house where there's an active shooter.
[00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:17.536]  These are big giant
[00:28:18.277 --> 00:28:23.379]  Armored vehicles that have homeland security, that homeland security has, but also local police are getting.
[00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:31.102]  More helicopters, more drones, weaponizing drones, checkpoints, these mobile armored pillboxes.
[00:28:34.643 --> 00:28:37.304]  It is mind-blowing, the military buildup.
[00:28:37.344 --> 00:28:41.426]  And I know I just keep harping on this, and harping on this, and harping on this.
[00:28:43.069 --> 00:28:45.231]  Max Keiser, who's on Friday, sent us this article.
[00:28:45.311 --> 00:28:46.292]  It's out of Bloomberg.
[00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:50.516]  Paulson Soros had gold as price declines most since 08.
[00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:57.082]  Yeah, big governments, universities, and the elite, the insiders who made their money because they have the inside knowledge.
[00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:57.863]  That's confirmed now.
[00:28:58.163 --> 00:28:59.444]  LIBOR, all of it staged.
[00:29:01.286 --> 00:29:05.169]  They are just hoarding the daylights out of gold right now.
[00:29:05.249 --> 00:29:07.971]  Buying the daylights out of the gold stocks, the physical.
[00:29:08.552 --> 00:29:09.272]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:29:09.292 --> 00:29:11.054]  So we're going to be getting into that.
[00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:12.915]  He sent me this email.
[00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:15.037]  He said the smart money knows the collapse is coming.
[00:29:15.057 --> 00:29:20.882]  They are getting ready, buying gold, silver, but the ETFs, they buy only honor delivery on
[00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:23.621]  $50,000 buys.
[00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:25.702]  Anyone who buys less will get wiped out.
[00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:28.403]  So he'll explain that to us on Friday.
[00:29:28.423 --> 00:29:30.243]  Got a bunch of financial news.
[00:29:30.803 --> 00:29:32.184]  A bunch of Paul Ryan news.
[00:29:32.224 --> 00:29:33.684]  Look, I've analyzed Paul Ryan.
[00:29:35.325 --> 00:29:43.787]  And I've gotta say, he's always been anti-abortion, and he's always been pro-gun, and he's actively fought for both.
[00:29:44.788 --> 00:29:46.048]  So I've got some comments on that.
[00:29:49.161 --> 00:29:52.146]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.087 --> 00:29:55.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:06.756]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:30:06.776 --> 00:30:12.060]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:14.142]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:30:14.603 --> 00:30:22.089]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:26.032]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:30:26.393 --> 00:30:30.376]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:30:30.757 --> 00:30:37.143]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:30:37.603 --> 00:30:40.244]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:30:40.644 --> 00:30:43.205]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:30:43.745 --> 00:30:47.187]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:50.028]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:30:50.508 --> 00:30:55.350]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.271]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:09.606]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:31:10.026 --> 00:31:13.669]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:20.914]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[00:31:21.415 --> 00:31:24.237]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:31:24.437 --> 00:31:28.940]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.923]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:35.204 --> 00:31:40.307]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:42.248]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:31:42.608 --> 00:31:47.151]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.036]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:31:59.588 --> 00:32:05.574]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:32:05.754 --> 00:32:08.517]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:32:08.717 --> 00:32:13.803]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:32:14.103 --> 00:32:18.788]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:32:19.048 --> 00:32:26.456]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:30.380]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.142]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:32:32.362 --> 00:32:36.246]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:32:36.386 --> 00:32:38.989]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:41.910]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.491]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:47.151]  Don't wait!
[00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:52.333]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:52.533 --> 00:32:56.854]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:57.034 --> 00:32:58.875]  You can bet your life on efoodsdirect.
[00:33:05.337 --> 00:33:06.657]  We now take you live
[00:33:06.966 --> 00:33:12.108]  Obviously I've analyzed Paul Ryan quite a bit in the last 14 years, and he's been a congressman.
[00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:26.527]  Again, if you just joined us, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:37.516]  Whether you're listening to us on AM and FM stations across the country, or XM 166, or Global Shortwave, or the free internet streams at InfoWars.com, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:37.556 --> 00:33:42.480]  We're also streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv of the three-hour radio show each day.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:47.263]  It's really a TV show, because we have video clips, document cam, guest in studio, you name it.
[00:33:47.604 --> 00:33:50.206]  We also have the nightly news, 7 o'clock Central, every night.
[00:33:50.706 --> 00:33:52.528]  And I come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:52.848 --> 00:34:01.114]  The Health Ranger's got a very special report for you with John B. Wells this Sunday, coming up on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:34:01.134 --> 00:34:03.716]  He, of course, is one of the hosts of Coast2CoastAM.com.
[00:34:04.317 --> 00:34:04.997]  Amazing folks.
[00:34:05.017 --> 00:34:09.821]  He's going to be on talking about financial collapse and what he's gleaned from all the experts he's interviewed over the years.
[00:34:10.242 --> 00:34:11.262]  That's on the Sunday show.
[00:34:11.302 --> 00:34:13.044]  Those two men will be hosting the show.
[00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:14.505]  Well, Mike Adams will be hosting.
[00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:15.966]  Wells will be riding shotgun.
[00:34:16.526 --> 00:34:16.827]  Okay.
[00:34:18.628 --> 00:34:20.589]  There is so much to go over here.
[00:34:20.749 --> 00:34:26.530]  Eli Lilly admits to more than $200 million dollars worth of doctor payoffs.
[00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.811]  Speaking of Mike Adams, that's a NaturalNews.com story.
[00:34:28.831 --> 00:34:30.191]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:34.312]  Special Ops group attacks Obama over Bin Laden bragging leaks.
[00:34:34.332 --> 00:34:38.253]  Yeah, because it's all a big PR made up story.
[00:34:38.293 --> 00:34:39.993]  It's why they blew the helicopter up on the ground.
[00:34:40.493 --> 00:34:42.814]  And the rest of SEAL Team 6 that knew about it got blown up.
[00:34:43.968 --> 00:34:44.508]  Remember that?
[00:34:44.528 --> 00:34:44.888]  Remember?
[00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:46.529]  I hadn't predicted that would happen.
[00:34:46.549 --> 00:34:49.650]  Uh, Chelsea won't rule out political run.
[00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.391]  Oh, is there no end to these demons?
[00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:54.712]  But she's had her nose job and stuff.
[00:34:55.032 --> 00:34:55.732]  Nothing against that.
[00:34:55.772 --> 00:34:57.213]  It's just, whatever.
[00:34:57.293 --> 00:34:58.233]  Bunch of plastic people.
[00:34:58.253 --> 00:34:59.193]  Looks like Joan Rivers.
[00:34:59.213 --> 00:35:05.756]  Looks like she's 40 years old and the portrait of Darian or Dorian Gray or whatever you call it, Edgar Allan Poe.
[00:35:05.776 --> 00:35:11.738]  Um, we're going to also get into bizarre statements by Biden about Romney.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:15.216]  Saying that, you know, he wants to put chains back on you.
[00:35:15.576 --> 00:35:17.276]  And again, Romney is a globalist.
[00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:18.256]  There's no debating that.
[00:35:18.897 --> 00:35:22.358]  But how does Paul Ryan change things?
[00:35:22.378 --> 00:35:33.541]  Because I've really done soul-searching about this whole situation, and I'm going to give you my take on where I stand on the 2012 election after we go to this piece of satire.
[00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:35.121]  Now, I did this back in
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.642]  January of this year, about seven months ago.
[00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:45.483]  And we did it teleprompter-free.
[00:35:45.503 --> 00:35:46.424]  This wasn't written.
[00:35:47.024 --> 00:35:49.966]  You know, when we did this comedy piece, people comment, oh, it's pretty funny.
[00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.647]  You know, Alex, you need better writers.
[00:35:51.907 --> 00:35:54.389]  There aren't writers here other than news article writers.
[00:35:55.409 --> 00:35:58.091]  By the way, we're waiting on Watson's article that should go up any minute.
[00:35:58.731 --> 00:36:03.034]  Not the Social Security Administration to purchase 174,000 rounds of hollow point bullets.
[00:36:03.314 --> 00:36:05.676]  That's the top story at DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.397]  And that is big news.
[00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:09.338]  And not the weather
[00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:12.603]  National Weather Service doing the same thing.
[00:36:13.344 --> 00:36:19.089]  No, now they're blacking out new purchases and they're of all different types.
[00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.791]  So, this is either for a foreign army.
[00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:26.035]  This is either for Mexico to destabilize things, which you know they also ship ammo down there.
[00:36:26.435 --> 00:36:27.896]  It's for something clandestine.
[00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:31.660]  This is even more than they need for an all-out civil war of the American people.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.921]  Or maybe it is to bankrupt.
[00:36:35.142 --> 00:36:40.384]  Uh, smaller shops and people who cannot get all this ammo now and who can't sell ammo.
[00:36:40.404 --> 00:36:43.085]  I mean, it's not that just the price is too high to buy.
[00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:44.525]  You can't get most of it.
[00:36:46.165 --> 00:36:47.826]  And now they're buying all the calibers.
[00:36:48.946 --> 00:36:53.428]  So, Watson's found some connections to shipping this to Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:55.588]  We're going to get into that as soon as this article goes up.
[00:36:55.608 --> 00:36:56.429]  It should go up any minute.
[00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:57.969]  Any minute.
[00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:03.811]  He's also going to post this video, this satire video, if you didn't see it, because I never played it on air.
[00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:08.285]  And it gets pretty funny towards the end, but why am I airing this now on the radio?
[00:37:08.325 --> 00:37:09.105]  I didn't air it before.
[00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:10.366]  I aired it on TV.
[00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:13.347]  Again, we shot it where I interviewed myself as Cobra Commander.
[00:37:13.427 --> 00:37:13.967]  It's a joke.
[00:37:15.908 --> 00:37:18.909]  And, you know, then we edited it right before the nightly news and put it on.
[00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:20.809]  So we did all of this in about an hour.
[00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:28.812]  I got in a Cobra Commander outfit, did my bit, then did questions to myself on the screen, and then put it on air.
[00:37:29.926 --> 00:37:31.767]  So it's, and I want to do more of this.
[00:37:31.807 --> 00:37:38.512]  It's why we've hired six reporters that are now making their way down here, and more video editors and stuff with all the capital you've helped us accrue.
[00:37:39.252 --> 00:37:41.394]  Because, I mean, I want to do serious stuff.
[00:37:41.414 --> 00:37:42.775]  I want to get back to making films.
[00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:45.697]  I want to get back to more, you know, reporting around the country.
[00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.018]  And I want to do satire.
[00:37:47.418 --> 00:37:54.162]  Because let me tell you, our satire pieces, and our social commentary pieces, and our pieces on media, we're going to do more of that.
[00:37:54.483 --> 00:37:56.284]  That's what's really reaching a wider audience.
[00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:01.733]  Because our government acts like Cobra Commander, a fictional bad guy.
[00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:06.636]  Torturing, setting people up, shipping arms around to destabilize things.
[00:38:08.137 --> 00:38:10.518]  So why not have Cobra Commander run?
[00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.800]  I mean, we don't know who Obama really is.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.440]  We don't know who Cobra Commander is.
[00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:18.443]  He's got all these different names and rumors about who he is.
[00:38:20.737 --> 00:38:29.024]  So here is my little satire piece and then we will come back with Watson's article that I'm told is going up any minute at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:38:29.044 --> 00:38:33.768]  This is big now that they're blacking out how much ammo they're getting after 1.4 billion.
[00:38:34.408 --> 00:38:35.990]  And again, they don't have authorization to do that.
[00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.411]  This is supposed to be public.
[00:38:38.612 --> 00:38:41.637]  You have to get authorization from Congress to classify something.
[00:38:42.158 --> 00:38:42.999]  They have to give a mandate.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.601]  So this is a big deal.
[00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.064]  I mean, they'll just start classifying everything.
[00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.467]  They classified how much radiation comes out of the scanners.
[00:38:48.748 --> 00:38:50.791]  Turns out it's enough to kill you over time.
[00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:51.612]  Doctors are saying that.
[00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:56.721]  So here is my interview with, well, a humanitarian, Cobra Commander.
[00:38:57.061 --> 00:39:02.724]  We're now joined by humanitarian and overall trendy Cobra Commander.
[00:39:02.804 --> 00:39:06.866]  He is an international terrorist, a dictator over third world countries.
[00:39:07.526 --> 00:39:18.052]  He's involved in bioweapons, weapon sales, and now in the modern America and modern world where torture, secret arrest, TSA, groping your children's genitals is what the good guys do.
[00:39:18.772 --> 00:39:20.313]  I thought we'd have him on.
[00:39:20.854 --> 00:39:33.625]  I know the media reaches out to Cobra Commander or Cobra Leader quite often and he refuses to come on, but he has agreed to do this interview because he has a big announcement tonight to make.
[00:39:34.566 --> 00:39:37.728]  to the people that live in this 1984 society.
[00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:44.875]  And again, if you're not with the Cobra Leader, or Mr. Cobra, then you're not a modern trendy.
[00:39:45.376 --> 00:39:48.558]  So I want to thank him for joining us this evening.
[00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:57.587]  Mr. Cobra, and associate, I guess minion, kind of like North Korea, thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[00:39:57.807 --> 00:39:59.828]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:03.591]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:08.274]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:40:09.035 --> 00:40:13.818]  You call your petty bureaucrats, officials and authorities?
[00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:20.303]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.010]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.696]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:45.022]  Your Supreme Excellency, Your Graciousness, Your Royal Highness, Cobra Commander, I should give you the same attention that other mass murderers get who run empires like the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.542]  I apologize.
[00:40:47.422 --> 00:40:54.765]  The corporate media for a long time has wondered who you actually are, and since I got your title wrong, will you please tell us
[00:40:55.865 --> 00:41:01.695]  Who you are, sir, because tyranny is so trendy right now, why not reveal yourself, your lordship?
[00:41:03.686 --> 00:41:06.869]  None of your pathetic business, worm!
[00:41:07.289 --> 00:41:08.671]  Submit to me!
[00:41:09.491 --> 00:41:14.256]  Even this gentleman here to my left is a servant of Cobra!
[00:41:14.676 --> 00:41:18.139]  For decades you've known him as the real Cobra Commander!
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:29.230]  Only now am I letting you pathetic people know that it is I, the true Cobra Commander, who have ruled from behind the scenes!
[00:41:30.917 --> 00:41:35.280]  Man, and I always liked the Bill of Rights and Constitution and due process.
[00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:36.962]  It is so cool.
[00:41:37.022 --> 00:41:38.423]  You just are talking down to me.
[00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.804]  Now I know how other Americans feel.
[00:41:40.844 --> 00:41:42.266]  We like being slaves.
[00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:44.667]  Thank you, sir.
[00:41:45.028 --> 00:41:46.309]  I've got so many other questions.
[00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:49.031]  Thank you for giving us this big, gracious interview.
[00:41:51.012 --> 00:41:53.434]  Miss Napolitano, I'm sorry to reveal your identity.
[00:41:53.494 --> 00:41:54.134]  I mean, forget that.
[00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:55.775]  Cobra Commander,
[00:41:57.112 --> 00:41:59.334]  Why are you agreeing to this interview?
[00:41:59.354 --> 00:42:02.016]  You said you had some special announcement for us.
[00:42:02.757 --> 00:42:05.239]  Please tell us what that is, sir.
[00:42:05.959 --> 00:42:06.820]  I am the leader!
[00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:08.742]  I am Cobra Commander!
[00:42:09.142 --> 00:42:14.767]  I have agreed to this interview so that you might know that I have decided to go public!
[00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:20.468]  And I have a public stock offering in Cobra Global Enterprises!
[00:42:21.128 --> 00:42:24.009]  I intend to issue my own fiat currency!
[00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:34.712]  But before I do that, I intend to sue Homeland Security for copyright and trademark infringement!
[00:42:35.272 --> 00:42:36.812]  Black uniforms!
[00:42:37.313 --> 00:42:38.493]  Black uniforms!
[00:42:39.213 --> 00:42:40.054]  Ski masks!
[00:42:40.395 --> 00:42:41.256]  Checkpoints!
[00:42:41.596 --> 00:42:43.778]  Black armored tanks on the streets!
[00:42:44.259 --> 00:42:45.500]  Preemptive war!
[00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:46.722]  Torture!
[00:42:47.082 --> 00:42:48.964]  Wireless wiretapping!
[00:42:49.365 --> 00:42:54.431]  Total tyranny is the new freedom that Cobra has taught the world!
[00:42:54.911 --> 00:42:59.717]  And now Joe and the Pentagon have stolen my plan!
[00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:07.301]  And hired Al-Qaeda to carry out their operations in Libya, which they formerly did for me!
[00:43:08.261 --> 00:43:15.305]  Now, clearly, America and the rest of the system has realized that I am the true visionary.
[00:43:15.805 --> 00:43:25.090]  And so I now announce to you and the world the greatest moment in the history of COBRA!
[00:43:25.511 --> 00:43:27.272]  COBRA!
[00:43:29.642 --> 00:43:41.396]  I will now sit for president and run on the Republican Party ticket against that plagiar of Barack Obama that's stolen so many of my ideas!
[00:43:42.785 --> 00:43:53.907]  Clearly an America that loves indefinite detention and the NDAA and torture and secret arrest is ready to be ruled by a true tyrant!
[00:43:54.707 --> 00:43:58.948]  I was a snake and an oppressor before it was cool!
[00:43:58.968 --> 00:44:01.229]  Hail Cobra!
[00:44:01.509 --> 00:44:02.449]  Cobra!
[00:44:02.989 --> 00:44:06.230]  I am running for President of the United States!
[00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.730]  And from America!
[00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:13.751]  I will congenure the policy of global corporate war against the third world!
[00:44:14.491 --> 00:44:15.732]  Death and destruction!
[00:44:16.212 --> 00:44:17.752]  Forced inoculations!
[00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:19.292]  Hail Cobra!
[00:44:19.773 --> 00:44:22.273]  Well, you're obviously keeping us safe from terrorists.
[00:44:22.453 --> 00:44:23.953]  I just only have a few more questions.
[00:44:23.993 --> 00:44:30.735]  Your supreme helper-nesses, official-nesses, authority is a powerful government.
[00:44:31.815 --> 00:44:34.938]  I know that you are a humanitarian and care about the population.
[00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:36.800]  What about climate change?
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.483]  What about carbon taxes that are being implemented?
[00:44:39.803 --> 00:44:43.667]  Where does COBRA as an organization stand on that, sir?
[00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:50.603]  As your future president, I agree with Al Gore.
[00:44:51.123 --> 00:45:02.431]  To be able to breathe or engage in any activity, you will pay not Gore, but me, your Supreme Leader, money to breathe!
[00:45:03.171 --> 00:45:09.115]  If you want to engage in any activity, you will get permission from Cobra!
[00:45:09.696 --> 00:45:14.179]  And I now have a giant Homeland Security Bureaucracy!
[00:45:15.499 --> 00:45:24.022]  And police wearing Cobra uniforms who are ready to strike fear into the slaves who will implement this system.
[00:45:24.322 --> 00:45:31.424]  So the answer, you pathetic worm, is yes, I will allow you to live if you pay me to breathe.
[00:45:32.404 --> 00:45:34.805]  Al Gore has served us well.
[00:45:36.005 --> 00:45:38.186]  What's your electoral strategy?
[00:45:38.746 --> 00:45:40.687]  How do you think you're going to be elected?
[00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:45.356]  Cobra is always confident.
[00:45:45.976 --> 00:46:06.422]  Not only do the American people clearly love my style of leadership, but if they are woken up by traitors against evil, like Ron Paul, I will simply implement the electronic voting machines, and the gullible sheeple will buy it all!
[00:46:06.962 --> 00:46:08.842]  Hail Cobra!
[00:46:09.402 --> 00:46:11.003]  Cobra!
[00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:22.752]  In closing, Your Worshipfulness, what is the essence of what you want to impart to all the people that want to live under authoritarian rule?
[00:46:26.388 --> 00:46:31.331]  And remember one more thing, you pathetic little worm and all of your viewers.
[00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:33.853]  You belong to me.
[00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:36.715]  Tyranny is freedom!
[00:46:36.735 --> 00:46:44.901]  The freedom for psychopaths like me and the armies of millions that serve me is the future!
[00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:50.484]  Resistance to Cobra is unstoppable!
[00:46:51.465 --> 00:46:56.634]  Because I'm keeping you safe from Al-Qaeda!
[00:46:56.994 --> 00:46:59.018]  Get me Bin Laden in here for orders!
[00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:03.885]  Get the CIA on the phone now and have them hail Cobra!
[00:47:04.383 --> 00:47:08.306]  Well, that's our interview with Cobra Commander, and I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:47:08.667 --> 00:47:24.940]  I, in the past, thought people like Cobra Commander were bad, but I'm a patriot, and now the government says torturing children in Iraq, secretly arresting Americans is good, putting cancer viruses in vaccines is good, and so, really, people like Cobra Commander are the good people.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.145]  Like, in the Bible, Judas is a good guy, Barabbas is good, Jesus is bad.
[00:47:34.178 --> 00:47:41.859]  And, of course, very dark satire there to illustrate how evil we've gotten, ladies and gentlemen, that the people say, give us Barabas!
[00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:43.360]  Give us Obama!
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:49.721]  I'm going to get into Paul Ryan and my take on that here in just a moment.
[00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:58.342]  When we come back from break, I'm going to get into some other geopolitical news ahead of John Rocker, WorldNet Daily writer and, of course, a controversial and famous baseball player.
[00:47:59.242 --> 00:48:02.743]  Joining us, we do have the article
[00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:07.290]  It's now up at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:08.711]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:48:08.751 --> 00:48:12.793]  DHS classifies ammo purchase following controversy.
[00:48:12.853 --> 00:48:13.034]  Yeah.
[00:48:13.234 --> 00:48:16.776]  DHS classifies new ammo purchases.
[00:48:16.816 --> 00:48:18.937]  I would just add that headline as editor-in-chief on the air.
[00:48:19.317 --> 00:48:22.179]  DHS classifies new ammo purchases.
[00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:26.001]  New ammo purchases following controversy.
[00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.102]  Great job, Watson.
[00:48:27.162 --> 00:48:29.203]  I tell you, what a powerhouse writer and researcher.
[00:48:29.223 --> 00:48:30.564]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:48:30.604 --> 00:48:32.104]  This is a big scandal.
[00:48:32.385 --> 00:48:33.365]  People know what they're looking at.
[00:48:33.665 --> 00:48:34.506]  We'll cover that in a moment.
[00:48:35.609 --> 00:48:37.450]  First off, I want to make two announcements here.
[00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:44.756]  We are now carrying discounted the entire line of incredible interviewed products that were born right here in Austin.
[00:48:45.317 --> 00:48:48.760]  These are the best green superfoods out there.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.101]  They've also got great coffee.
[00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:56.626]  They've also got these medicine chest of essential oils that are the purest proprietary quality.
[00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:07.626]  So if you go to InfoWarsShop.com, we are now carrying their entire line discounted.
[00:49:08.387 --> 00:49:09.867]  InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:49:09.887 --> 00:49:17.148]  They also now have a 40 days, 40 nights organic storable food all in one big plastic tote box.
[00:49:17.728 --> 00:49:19.769]  Check it out at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:24.270]  The entire line discounted now at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.430]  Entire interfood line and more.
[00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.671]  Lastly, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see this.
[00:49:30.271 --> 00:49:33.092]  If not, by next week I'm going to put a promo video out to show everybody.
[00:49:33.752 --> 00:49:34.212]  Look at this.
[00:49:34.792 --> 00:49:36.193]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:39.274]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:49:40.214 --> 00:49:48.497]  And if you're watching again on PrisonPlanet.tv, there is one of the racks that we are going to be putting up.
[00:49:48.577 --> 00:49:50.877]  I guess you can't really see it good against a black background.
[00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:52.618]  Here, I'll just show it to folks this way.
[00:49:54.062 --> 00:49:56.724]  I'll kind of be like Judge Schmales when the lamp's in the way.
[00:49:56.764 --> 00:49:57.685]  Just knock it out.
[00:49:57.705 --> 00:49:59.607]  Knock it out of the way, Danny!
[00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:01.228]  There's two kinds of things.
[00:50:01.328 --> 00:50:02.850]  Good things and bad things.
[00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.331]  Do you want to be good, Danny?
[00:50:04.371 --> 00:50:05.632]  Yes, I want to be good.
[00:50:05.892 --> 00:50:06.212]  Good.
[00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:07.353]  Very good.
[00:50:08.054 --> 00:50:13.459]  I just have to neurotically now quote... Do they have a Tourette's Syndrome where you have to quote, uh... Caddyshack?
[00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:18.183]  I guess Spalding actually has it in there.
[00:50:18.203 --> 00:50:20.385]  When he's like hacking at the balls, he's like...
[00:50:21.308 --> 00:50:22.889]  I hate to talk a little kid, but you're allowed to.
[00:50:22.949 --> 00:50:23.330]  It's funny.
[00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:24.370]  Turds!
[00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:25.231]  Double turds!
[00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:26.052]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[00:50:26.672 --> 00:50:28.173]  I am getting... I apologize.
[00:50:28.473 --> 00:50:29.214]  Horrible, evil.
[00:50:29.474 --> 00:50:30.755]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:31.936 --> 00:50:32.617]  These racks...
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.721]  800 locations in Austin.
[00:50:36.781 --> 00:50:38.142]  We're not playing games, okay?
[00:50:38.162 --> 00:50:39.642]  You think this was cheap?
[00:50:39.982 --> 00:50:41.883]  800 locations in Austin.
[00:50:42.303 --> 00:50:43.964]  50,000 on the streets.
[00:50:43.984 --> 00:50:48.625]  20,000 mailed out to everybody that orders goods at InfoWarshop.com, or you can bulk order them at price.
[00:50:49.085 --> 00:50:49.706]  At cost.
[00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.426]  So, InfoWarshop.com.
[00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:53.527]  It's coming soon, the InfoWars magazine.
[00:50:54.387 --> 00:50:56.328]  This is our answer to the internet kill switch.
[00:50:56.628 --> 00:50:57.108]  Print 2.0.
[00:50:57.168 --> 00:50:58.929]  Fahrenheit this.
[00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:06.167]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:51:06.328 --> 00:51:09.089]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:51:09.289 --> 00:51:14.391]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:19.393]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:51:19.653 --> 00:51:26.956]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[00:51:27.276 --> 00:51:30.977]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:51:31.157 --> 00:51:32.718]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:51:32.938 --> 00:51:36.799]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:51:36.939 --> 00:51:39.580]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.501]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:47.062]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:51:47.202 --> 00:51:47.723]  Don't wait!
[00:51:47.863 --> 00:51:49.723]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:51:49.743 --> 00:51:49.883]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:51:55.585 --> 00:52:04.030]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.832]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:52:07.712 --> 00:52:16.057]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:52:16.697 --> 00:52:21.600]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[00:52:22.236 --> 00:52:33.199]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[00:52:56.428 --> 00:52:57.428]  Protect your immune system.
[00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:58.749]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:04.330]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:13.893 --> 00:53:27.937]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and recleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[00:53:28.217 --> 00:53:36.160]  Order the Berkey Light System today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only $231, and the Berkey Guy will ship your order free of charge.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:41.902]  With the purchase of a Berkey Light, the Berkey Guy is also offering a set of fluoride and arsenic filters for only $39.99.
[00:53:43.342 --> 00:53:45.484]  That's over 30% off the retail price.
[00:53:45.684 --> 00:53:46.604]  Call the Berkey guy at 1-877-886-3653.
[00:53:46.624 --> 00:53:46.824]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:53:48.005 --> 00:53:49.226]  That's GoBerkey.com today!
[00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:20.333]  Okay, Russell Dowden, who heads up the rollout of InfoWars newspaper.
[00:54:20.353 --> 00:54:24.175]  It's going to be all over the country, and we have our way, but rolling out in Austin.
[00:54:24.335 --> 00:54:26.617]  It's 50,000 at 1,000 locations.
[00:54:26.777 --> 00:54:27.998]  Excuse me.
[00:54:28.518 --> 00:54:31.920]  1,000 locations in Austin, and then 20,000 mailed out to listeners.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.842]  And then we're going to look for partners around the country.
[00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:42.164]  To have part of their content and their ads in the newspaper slash magazine.
[00:54:42.184 --> 00:54:42.905]  It's a publication.
[00:54:43.645 --> 00:54:44.586]  It's really a big newspaper.
[00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:46.747]  And we're going to roll it out.
[00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:52.771]  And we were able to pay for the first month that had a lot of added expenses up front the first time with advertising.
[00:54:53.051 --> 00:54:54.792]  And I guarantee you people are going to get a big response.
[00:54:54.832 --> 00:54:58.374]  So people are already contacting us about franchising.
[00:54:58.394 --> 00:55:00.195]  We haven't rolled out the website for that yet.
[00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:01.536]  We're just doing phase one right now.
[00:55:03.437 --> 00:55:05.700]  Again, they zig, we zag.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:10.285]  They want to censor the web, we'll keep fighting there, but we'll also go to hard copy.
[00:55:11.246 --> 00:55:14.149]  I'm not going to get into a whole breakdown of that, I will soon.
[00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:15.291]  Okay, um...
[00:55:17.145 --> 00:55:18.526]  You know, this story is too big.
[00:55:18.566 --> 00:55:25.528]  I'll have to bring this up with Mr. Rocker when he's on, and then more in the third hour because we're running out of time right now.
[00:55:25.969 --> 00:55:30.490]  But DHS classifies ammo purchases following controversy.
[00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.571]  I already covered this a lot before the article came out.
[00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:36.593]  The Department of Homeland Security has redacted information relating to the
[00:55:37.293 --> 00:55:47.235]  Quantity of bullets it is buying following a controversy concerning the agency's purchase of over a billion rounds of ammo, which many fear is a sign of federal government's preparing for civil unrest in the United States.
[00:55:47.775 --> 00:56:02.678]  Despite the fact that documents are only supposed to be redacted if authorized by Congress or for national security reasons, a solicitation posted on the FedBizOpps website yesterday concerning ammunition purchased by the DHS on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
[00:56:03.038 --> 00:56:05.619]  Which they used under Rex 84, really, for the American people.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.501]  ICE contains numerous blacked out sections.
[00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:12.683]  We know Border Patrol was involved helping arm the Mexicans under Obama's orders.
[00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:13.643]  Wonder if that's part of that.
[00:56:14.103 --> 00:56:15.124]  Is this Fast and Furious?
[00:56:15.144 --> 00:56:15.524]  Probably.
[00:56:15.904 --> 00:56:26.670]  The classified portions of the document include references to the amount of 223 and 223-64 grain ammunition being purchased.
[00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:28.470]  And it just goes on.
[00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.432]  So, now they're doing that and he goes through the rest of it.
[00:56:32.625 --> 00:56:37.448]  I'll talk about this more tomorrow, but I really want to do the right thing in soul-searching.
[00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:40.330]  I cannot vote for Mitt Romney.
[00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:49.676]  I know he's been for abortion, gun bans, open borders, carbon taxes, globalism, tax-exempt garbage, all of it.
[00:56:50.257 --> 00:56:50.737]  He's fake.
[00:56:51.838 --> 00:56:54.820]  But Paul Ryan has got a lot of issues.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:01.304]  No Child Left Behind, NDAA, Patriot Act, banker bailouts.
[00:57:03.035 --> 00:57:10.758]  And I don't get into lesser of two evils here, but I do have to say, he has voted and actually fought, not just paid lip service against abortion.
[00:57:11.258 --> 00:57:14.900]  That's a big rubber meets the road issue.
[00:57:16.401 --> 00:57:28.726]  And he's been pro-gun, and he's one of the only people out there defending the Second Amendment right now, when you've got the Republican leadership, Bill Kristol, well you name it, Bill O'Reilly,
[00:57:30.595 --> 00:57:34.436]  Rupert Murdoch, the list goes, Michael Savage saying, yeah, we don't need semi-autos, ban them.
[00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:40.677]  So he at least is paying lip service to that, so I don't know what to do.
[00:57:41.217 --> 00:57:51.579]  With Romney, there wasn't really a difference between him and Obama, and I know if Romney gets in, conservatives and libertarians will go to sleep, and I guarantee you Romney's just going to continue what everything Obama did, because that's what the globalists want.
[00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:55.979]  It's like Bush supported, at the end, carbon taxes and shutting down power plants.
[00:57:56.419 --> 00:57:59.220]  It's not about the environment, it's about big companies shutting down the competition.
[00:58:00.886 --> 00:58:14.092]  But, if I then don't at least admit that Paul Ryan's better than Obama, even though he'd be VP, then it's almost, I'm like, not saying he's good on abortion and guns.
[00:58:14.972 --> 00:58:18.473]  So, I'm rarely, I'm a good talk show host because I'm decisive.
[00:58:18.794 --> 00:58:20.674]  I believe what I believe, I think about it, and that's it.
[00:58:21.355 --> 00:58:24.216]  But on this, I'm just sharing with you my own personal
[00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:34.644]  My own personal, you know, thoughts, because I don't want to just be pig-headed and sit here and attack Ryan when he's got some good attributes.
[00:58:34.984 --> 00:58:35.664]  What do you think?
[00:58:36.165 --> 00:58:37.926]  Let me know at Twitter, Real Alex Jones.
[00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:46.594]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:55.224]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:55.464 --> 00:58:57.666]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:57.886 --> 00:59:03.429]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:06.831]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:10.173]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.874]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:14.156]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:59:14.396 --> 00:59:16.877]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.279]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:19.479 --> 00:59:20.800]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.763]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:24.063 --> 00:59:27.246]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:27.446 --> 00:59:31.429]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:34.191]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:34.331 --> 00:59:35.652]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:35.913 --> 00:59:39.115]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:59:39.215 --> 00:59:44.480]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.562]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:48.044]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:53.732]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:08.844]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:10.385]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.165 --> 01:00:12.066]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.686 --> 01:00:16.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:20.951]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:39.398]  The globalists buying a billion, four hundred million rounds plus of ammo the last eleven months, a billion plus of it this year alone, the last seven, eight months, is a sign of their abject panic and fear.
[01:00:40.398 --> 01:00:43.280]  It's a sign of the tyrants wanting to mass their weapons against us.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:51.064]  But more and more, the way this ammo is being bought in all the different calibers, and the way it's connected to the State Department and other groups and other agencies,
[01:00:52.162 --> 01:00:58.708]  And the way it's being sent to all these places on the East Coast, I think they're fencing this stuff out to the Al-Qaeda rebels.
[01:00:58.748 --> 01:01:01.570]  And Watson says he's ferreted into some info that suggests that.
[01:01:02.171 --> 01:01:04.433]  But all I know is they did Fast and Furious.
[01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:05.373]  They're capable of doing anything.
[01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:06.434]  We know they're arming Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:06.795 --> 01:01:07.635]  Is this part of it?
[01:01:08.176 --> 01:01:11.579]  DHS classifies new ammo purchased following controversy.
[01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:13.600]  That's up at Infowars.com.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.043]  Also, Arkansas police released suicide reenactment video.
[01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:20.828]  Of handcuffed man who shot himself in the head.
[01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:26.676]  Social Security Administration to purchase 174,000 rounds of hollow point bullets.
[01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:27.637]  The U.S.
[01:01:27.677 --> 01:01:30.541]  government coming war with the American people, Mike Adams.
[01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:32.884]  The Roman-style collapse of Western civilization.
[01:01:32.924 --> 01:01:34.026]  If I have time, I'm going to play that.
[01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:37.914]  Maybe when Mr. Rocker leaves, it's coming up after this next segment.
[01:01:39.055 --> 01:01:42.338]  Great little five-minute report by Watson on that, dealing with our article yesterday.
[01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.339]  Rome burned, will we?
[01:01:43.359 --> 01:01:46.482]  Blue Rockwell government is far worse than the Mafia.
[01:01:46.962 --> 01:01:50.386]  Mississippi River is a-goin' dry, right out of Hank Williams Jr.'
[01:01:50.366 --> 01:01:50.926]  's anthem.
[01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:59.635]  Preacher man says it's the end of time in the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry.
[01:02:01.813 --> 01:02:04.734]  And continuing, well, we didn't pay Al Gore enough money, that's why that's happening.
[01:02:04.934 --> 01:02:06.735]  It's always gotten dry from time to time.
[01:02:07.315 --> 01:02:07.876]  Very small.
[01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:11.317]  Israel to demand guarantee Obama will attack Iran.
[01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:14.158]  That's not just Richard Silverstein's excellent article.
[01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:18.360]  Richard Silverstein, we also have articles in Israel saying that's where everything's going.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.041]  I mean, this is scary times, to say the least.
[01:02:22.441 --> 01:02:23.442]  That is all coming up.
[01:02:23.462 --> 01:02:26.743]  But let's look at this top story ahead of John Rocker joining us.
[01:02:27.183 --> 01:02:31.025]  DHS classifies ammo purchase following controversy.
[01:02:32.904 --> 01:02:36.825]  And again, they just can't do that because this isn't mandated to be classified.
[01:02:36.845 --> 01:02:39.486]  That's why they're supposed to put it out for public bid and show what it's for.
[01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:58.812]  Despite the fact that documents are only supposed to be redacted or authorized by Congress for national security reasons, a solicitation posted on the FedBizOpps website yesterday concerning ammunition purchases made by DHS, that's the Foreign Banker Absorption Army, on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
[01:03:00.199 --> 01:03:04.641]  Contains numerous blacked out sections dealing with 223 and other rounds.
[01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.002]  We have the image of it up there.
[01:03:07.022 --> 01:03:11.125]  The solicitation and the classified portions of the documents include references.
[01:03:11.665 --> 01:03:18.028]  The solicitation explains how the contract put out by the DHS to purchase the ammunition was not subject to full and open competition.
[01:03:18.909 --> 01:03:19.589]  Ah, no bid!
[01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:27.389]  A process justified by what DHS claims was an unusual and compelling urgency to acquire the bullets.
[01:03:27.949 --> 01:03:30.531]  So that means they can pay way above market to drive up the price.
[01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:35.613]  And you notice some of these big globalist brokerage firms are buying up the ammo and gun companies.
[01:03:36.274 --> 01:03:39.836]  And now when DHS buys these, it drives up the price out of our reach.
[01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.797]  Oh yeah, this is part of it, no doubt.
[01:03:42.357 --> 01:03:46.320]  Knowing that there was a shortage of bullets, which is threatening a situation which could cause
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.226]  Substantial safety issues for the government.
[01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:51.852]  Oh yeah, if you don't have more than 1.4 billion rounds.
[01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:55.902]  Should law enforcement officials not be adequately armed?
[01:03:57.196 --> 01:04:08.245]  The Department of Homeland Security's decision to black out sections of the document, including the number of bullets being purchased, is likely to be related to a massive controversy, which has snowballed over the last few weeks.
[01:04:08.565 --> 01:04:11.648]  Yeah, we got two articles on Drudge right now with it, DrudgeReport.com.
[01:04:12.128 --> 01:04:21.756]  The last few weeks pertaining to concerns as to why the federal agency has purchased well over a billion rounds of bullets over the last six months alone.
[01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:24.712]  Yeah, it's over 1.4 billion in the last year.
[01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:33.563]  The DHS decision back in March to purchase 450 million rounds of .40 caliber hollow point bullets, which are designed to expand upon entry and cause maximum organ damage.
[01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:39.149]  Well, the point is, they're illegal in warfare under the Geneva Convention, so our military doesn't use them.
[01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:42.673]  But they're used on us because we're the scum, we're the milk cows, we're the idiots.
[01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:44.487]  And it just goes on.
[01:04:44.808 --> 01:04:46.350]  It's a powerful article.
[01:04:46.751 --> 01:04:48.754]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:48.974 --> 01:04:55.985]  You can find our other articles about the Social Security Administration and the Weather Service buying ammo, all at DrugsReport.com.
[01:04:56.005 --> 01:04:58.068]  We're streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.868]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:03.168 --> 01:05:07.971]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:15.355]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:15.475 --> 01:05:20.899]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:24.862]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:05:25.142 --> 01:05:29.665]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:05:29.865 --> 01:05:35.009]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:36.790]  We're getting prepared.
[01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:37.330]  Are you?
[01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:38.370]  InfoWarsShop.com

[01:06:59.775 --> 01:07:01.035]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.075 --> 01:07:06.418]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:06.658 --> 01:07:11.300]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.080]  It's true.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.741]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:16.702]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:21.945]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:22.466 --> 01:07:24.387]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:07:24.787 --> 01:07:29.390]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:30.491]  And here's the best part.
[01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:33.473]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:37.075]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:37.396 --> 01:07:40.237]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:42.479]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:43.720]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:07:47.362 --> 01:07:48.043]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:56.109]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:56.429 --> 01:07:58.891]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:08:01.012 --> 01:08:03.214]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.774 --> 01:08:06.596]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.635 --> 01:08:25.860]  Man, I tell you, they had Joe Biden come out and say that Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney want to put chains on the black people, basically.
[01:08:28.482 --> 01:08:33.325]  And it just shows the incredible racial division that the left always engages in.
[01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:38.988]  Not because they care about people coming together racially, because they want to keep people on that hate plantation.
[01:08:40.188 --> 01:08:47.250]  And it must work, because what, 95% of folks voted, who were black, ended up voting for Obama.
[01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:51.050]  Again, I wouldn't vote for somebody on their race.
[01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:53.331]  I would vote for someone on what they stood for.
[01:08:54.851 --> 01:09:03.073]  But now, the Romney campaign has come out and said, quote, take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago.
[01:09:04.417 --> 01:09:12.079]  And I tell you, Obama coming out and saying, if you have a business, you didn't build that, you didn't do that, somebody else did that, that's a quote.
[01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.840]  That's what I would say if I wanted to lose.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.561]  But it also shows, you know, we've got government-run healthcare now.
[01:09:19.901 --> 01:09:21.241]  I mean, they're doing what they want.
[01:09:21.301 --> 01:09:27.783]  They want to get us accustomed to this so they can take over businesses like Hugo Chavez does down in Venezuela.
[01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:33.668]  Just amazing to say they're going to put y'all back in chains.
[01:09:33.688 --> 01:09:34.429]  We've got the clip.
[01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:37.932]  We're going to play it a little bit later in the broadcast.
[01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:48.561]  Now we are joined for the next 45 minutes or so by, well, author, businessman, he's been very, very successful in business, John Rocker.
[01:09:49.802 --> 01:09:54.506]  And of course, you also know him as being a top national baseball
[01:09:55.632 --> 01:10:02.554]  Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played for a bunch of major teams like Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, you name it.
[01:10:02.955 --> 01:10:09.377]  And he's known for all the big controversies with statements he made taken out of context, twisted.
[01:10:10.612 --> 01:10:14.793]  Because I've seen a lot of other controversial statements, even more controversial, that don't seem to catch on.
[01:10:15.033 --> 01:10:17.014]  So we'll ask him today why he thinks that happened.
[01:10:17.034 --> 01:10:19.695]  But we're not, we don't have John Rocker here because of all that.
[01:10:20.035 --> 01:10:30.078]  We have him so you can actually hear him soundbite-free in a long-form interview, because I like reading his writings over at worldnetdaily.com, wmd.com.
[01:10:30.419 --> 01:10:31.839]  And that's why he joins us today.
[01:10:31.859 --> 01:10:34.580]  And we'll also get into his book, Rocker.
[01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:38.953]  Scars and strikes.
[01:10:39.534 --> 01:10:41.197]  And he joins us right now.
[01:10:41.257 --> 01:10:42.358]  Good to have you on with us, John.
[01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:47.190]  Well, we appreciate having you.
[01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:55.056]  Well, I mean, tell us who you really are, because I know that's kind of what you do with WorldNetDaily, where you really stand, because I know how the media works.
[01:10:55.136 --> 01:11:00.281]  Once they take something and run with it, they once said that I said, kill Michelle Malkin, even though I didn't.
[01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:05.144]  People with her yelled that, and then I still am blamed for saying that.
[01:11:06.285 --> 01:11:12.951]  And then once it's not in the national news, and the truth is there, or there's even a retraction in the newspaper, nobody reads it.
[01:11:14.449 --> 01:11:15.489]  You're absolutely right.
[01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:19.450]  Hey Alex, I'm going to be a pain in the backside here for a second.
[01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:22.871]  I'm getting a lot of feedback on my end.
[01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:24.171]  Can we hang up and start over?
[01:11:25.152 --> 01:11:25.752]  Absolutely.
[01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:26.972]  You called into our system.
[01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:27.872]  Do you want us to call you?
[01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:30.253]  How about you guys just return the call?
[01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:31.153]  I'm just getting a lot.
[01:11:31.193 --> 01:11:32.833]  I'm hearing every word that I'm saying.
[01:11:33.574 --> 01:11:37.435]  And my right ear here is going to be very distracting through a long call.
[01:11:37.455 --> 01:11:38.055]  Sure, sure.
[01:11:38.075 --> 01:11:41.336]  Maybe we can turn our audio to him down, guys.
[01:11:42.096 --> 01:11:42.956]  John, how's that sound?
[01:11:44.253 --> 01:11:45.014]  Uh, let me think.
[01:11:45.494 --> 01:11:46.115]  Yeah, okay.
[01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.896]  I'm not here to deceive you.
[01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:48.957]  I'm still here at Alex.
[01:11:49.237 --> 01:11:51.599]  Alright, well we'll call you right back or you call us back.
[01:11:51.639 --> 01:11:53.501]  Hey, this is a great way to build up an interview.
[01:11:54.682 --> 01:11:55.082]  Exactly.
[01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:56.263]  Alright, call me back, man.
[01:11:56.503 --> 01:11:57.564]  Alright, we'll call you right back.
[01:11:57.604 --> 01:11:58.625]  We'll see how that goes.
[01:11:59.646 --> 01:12:00.606]  Is that on our phone lines?
[01:12:00.646 --> 01:12:01.247]  They work fine.
[01:12:03.857 --> 01:12:04.898]  He does sound dynamite.
[01:12:05.178 --> 01:12:08.019]  Did he call into a digital line, a high-def phone line?
[01:12:08.039 --> 01:12:08.819]  That's probably what it is.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.160]  Which is great!
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.641]  You know, we try to give you high-def phone lines here on Talk Radio.
[01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:15.563]  And we try, most Talk Radio national shows don't even do that.
[01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:19.765]  We use high-def connections when the person has them, but sometimes there's problems.
[01:12:20.185 --> 01:12:24.407]  And we use Skype, audio Skype, when they don't want to do video, because the quality is better.
[01:12:25.827 --> 01:12:26.348]  I don't know why.
[01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:30.131]  I go on a lot of great national shows and they don't ever do that.
[01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:32.194]  I'm like, hey, we have digital phone lines.
[01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:34.296]  Hey, we have, we have audio Skype.
[01:12:34.336 --> 01:12:36.739]  Hey, we have, no, no, regular phone line.
[01:12:36.759 --> 01:12:44.928]  Uh, and, and maybe they're right to not do that because sometimes you do have the problems, especially when somebody calls in once the show is already in motion.
[01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:51.050]  So I hope to get him on the show because I was up at WorldNet Daily headquarters and they were telling me he was a listener.
[01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:58.332]  So I look forward to getting his take on the DHS and TSA was what he wanted to talk about here on the broadcast today.
[01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:04.833]  Spike Lee says Obama will do whatever he wants in second term.
[01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:09.954]  New Black Panthers to RNC.
[01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:13.175]  Our feet will be on your mother effing necks.
[01:13:14.497 --> 01:13:15.798]  Talk about being FBI funded.
[01:13:15.818 --> 01:13:22.002]  In Harvard essay, young Michelle Obama argued for race-based faculty hiring.
[01:13:24.823 --> 01:13:29.466]  Top Homeland Security official to leave after lewd conduct charges.
[01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:34.710]  One of Big Sis's special friends.
[01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:39.332]  So, special friends in that she reportedly was promoted.
[01:13:40.322 --> 01:13:45.143]  Without having any of the job requirements she needed.
[01:13:45.903 --> 01:13:48.504]  All you gotta be is an anti-American jackboot, though, I thought.
[01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:50.465]  And have the TSA abuse everybody.
[01:13:52.105 --> 01:13:52.805]  Hey, John!
[01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:54.225]  I'm back, Alex.
[01:13:54.245 --> 01:13:55.026]  We'll try this again.
[01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:55.746]  How's it sound?
[01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:56.966]  Sorry for the interruption.
[01:13:57.346 --> 01:13:57.966]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:13:58.006 --> 01:13:58.747]  How's it sound now?
[01:13:59.307 --> 01:14:00.387]  It sounds much better.
[01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:01.447]  I don't know.
[01:14:01.467 --> 01:14:04.368]  These landlines, you never know quite what's going on with them.
[01:14:04.755 --> 01:14:05.355]  That's okay.
[01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:06.816]  Hey, listen, good to have you here.
[01:14:07.296 --> 01:14:08.357]  Wow, where should we start?
[01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:10.338]  Tell us about what you've done out of baseball.
[01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:12.159]  I know you're very successful in business.
[01:14:12.359 --> 01:14:17.722]  You know, I guess, you know, being successful is always, I guess, from the eye of the beholder.
[01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:20.063]  I always have a relative statement.
[01:14:20.843 --> 01:14:25.765]  You know, I got into real estate really by the late 90s when I first started playing.
[01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:29.087]  I did a lot of successful deals.
[01:14:29.187 --> 01:14:30.447]  I just was a spot investor.
[01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:34.709]  Shopping centers, multifamily deals, a few single family attached deals.
[01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:42.653]  I was fortunate enough, I guess, to kind of surround myself with some very influential people, some very knowledgeable people, some very experienced people.
[01:14:43.233 --> 01:14:51.016]  Obviously, you know, 20, 30, sometimes 40 years my senior, that really gave me kind of a hard path for real-world education on real estate.
[01:14:51.857 --> 01:14:58.840]  I did my first real estate deal by myself, my first solo deal, actually while I was still playing a little 70-lot deal up north of Atlanta.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.300]  We're good to go.
[01:15:14.568 --> 01:15:14.988]  I'm good to go.
[01:15:31.386 --> 01:15:32.107]  We're good to go.
[01:15:48.819 --> 01:15:52.524]  You were already pregnant, Lucy, and there was no choice but to have the kids.
[01:15:52.584 --> 01:15:55.387]  So, you know, off of those deals, got them done, got them built.
[01:15:55.428 --> 01:15:57.090]  The Mulker family has done real well.
[01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:59.393]  The For Sale product's not done so well.
[01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:01.996]  Like I said, kind of basically playing for the tie.
[01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.338]  You're not really making a whole lot of money.
[01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:05.721]  If you just get out of there with a shirt on your back, you're happy.
[01:16:06.441 --> 01:16:08.883]  Well, I had just read that you've been pretty successful in real estate.
[01:16:09.463 --> 01:16:15.868]  And I've done well, and I can't say that it's been all roses, but it certainly hasn't been all bad either.
[01:16:15.928 --> 01:16:19.950]  In this market, if you're making any money, I would say you are very successful.
[01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:20.311]  You're right.
[01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:21.131]  Sure.
[01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:22.672]  Tell us about the book.
[01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:23.152]  I've read it.
[01:16:23.213 --> 01:16:24.193]  It's very interesting.
[01:16:24.673 --> 01:16:28.096]  And then the columns you're writing for WorldNetDaily.
[01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:39.651]  You know, the book, it was just something that, you know, I just kind of needed to get off my chest, obviously, with what you talked about before we broke for a brief period of time a few minutes ago.
[01:16:40.212 --> 01:16:47.258]  Just the gross misperception that media has, you know, continued to hammer home for, you know, better than a decade now.
[01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:48.519]  Actually, more than a decade now.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.501]  Just kind of gotten tired of it.
[01:16:51.662 --> 01:17:00.268]  You know, the old cliché, and I actually use this cliché in my book, you know, the old cliché is don't ever fist fight or pick a fight with a guy who buys ink by the truckload.
[01:17:00.788 --> 01:17:06.252]  Well, you know, to write this book, I finally decided to buy my own truck and write my own book.
[01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:08.434]  I didn't have a ghost ride on this book.
[01:17:08.454 --> 01:17:14.558]  I had a very brief, partial, extremely, you know, small amount, partial collection.
[01:17:14.818 --> 01:17:15.958]  We're good to go.
[01:17:31.883 --> 01:17:32.323]  We're good to go.
[01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:01.963]  The song still remains the same.
[01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:14.731]  Kind of like what you were saying earlier, once a perception is out there, once the ideology, especially about a specific person, is out there in the media, it's very tough to change.
[01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:22.936]  And the sexy story about John Rocker, the one that drives ratings of film, magazines, and newspapers, is John Rocker, all the hateful, outdated racists from the South.
[01:18:22.996 --> 01:18:27.799]  That's the one that just splashed that caption, that headline, on top of the newspaper article.
[01:18:28.439 --> 01:18:28.939]  We're good to go.
[01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:59.002]  Sure, and off of controversy, but I mean a lot of your statements were really taken out of context and weren't even that big of a deal.
[01:18:59.503 --> 01:19:03.868]  Why do you think they chose you to keep hyping things up?
[01:19:04.776 --> 01:19:05.597]  I don't know.
[01:19:06.297 --> 01:19:07.979]  I think I was good for ratings.
[01:19:08.079 --> 01:19:09.080]  I was good for PR.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:21.330]  And obviously when you pick a fight with Foxworth and News, capital of the world, there's a lot of eyes and ears listening and looking and a lot of fingers to type and write.
[01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:23.010]  Yeah, that's probably it.
[01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:40.657]  I mean you criticize New York and from some of the quotes and said people were like slobs on the on the train and and and I guess some of the trains and you do see some slobs on them and yeah that's the thing New York does not like being criticized and so I think it was the archetype of we're gonna get that Southern boy now.
[01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:42.252]  Stay there.
[01:19:42.272 --> 01:19:42.632]  Let's come back.
[01:19:42.652 --> 01:19:42.912]  Stay there.
[01:19:42.932 --> 01:19:44.093]  We've got to go to break.
[01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.414]  John Rocker is our guest.
[01:19:45.434 --> 01:19:49.215]  We're going to get into your view on what's happening right now with the TSA as well.
[01:20:01.641 --> 01:20:07.463]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:20:07.483 --> 01:20:12.625]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:20:12.925 --> 01:20:14.665]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:20:15.105 --> 01:20:22.408]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:20:22.908 --> 01:20:26.230]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:30.473]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:20:30.853 --> 01:20:37.117]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:20:37.557 --> 01:20:40.118]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:20:40.519 --> 01:20:43.020]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.902]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:20:47.162 --> 01:20:49.584]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:20:50.104 --> 01:20:54.787]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:20:55.087 --> 01:20:57.368]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[01:22:59.534 --> 01:22:59.934]  Hi there.
[01:23:00.535 --> 01:23:01.595]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:02.056 --> 01:23:05.278]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:05.878 --> 01:23:14.684]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:15.044 --> 01:23:21.068]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:21.749 --> 01:23:23.330]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:29.014]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:29.734 --> 01:23:36.838]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:37.698 --> 01:23:42.600]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:49.164]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:49.764 --> 01:23:55.107]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:55.487 --> 01:23:56.747]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:01.384 --> 01:24:09.528]  Well, John Rocker, Scars and Strikes.
[01:24:10.408 --> 01:24:11.589]  Book's done very, very well.
[01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:14.070]  Here's the headline in the Huffington Post.
[01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:19.033]  John Rocker's new book, Scars and Strikes, aims to fix the former pitcher's public image.
[01:24:19.753 --> 01:24:22.815]  He's also writing for WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:24:23.235 --> 01:24:25.256]  He gets criticized because he says, hey, speak English.
[01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:33.647]  The illegals are running around putting Mexican flags on top of American flags or pulling them down and telling us we should speak only Spanish.
[01:24:34.873 --> 01:24:41.874]  In San Francisco, it was in MSNBC a few years ago, that the Hispanic kids can't wear American flags to school.
[01:24:41.894 --> 01:24:42.954]  They're told that's racist.
[01:24:43.014 --> 01:24:49.176]  So, this has gotten so crazy now, that if you're for our sovereignty, you're bad.
[01:24:49.436 --> 01:24:50.756]  And we'll cover that with him.
[01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:54.236]  I totally agree with him on that front, and he shouldn't be criticized for that.
[01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:57.857]  But it shows this out-of-control political correctness, how serious it's gotten.
[01:24:58.277 --> 01:25:01.738]  But you were wanting to make your point about immigrants as we went to break.
[01:25:01.778 --> 01:25:03.218]  That's why I raised that, John.
[01:25:07.722 --> 01:25:08.562]  We're good to go.
[01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:38.177]  We're good to go.
[01:26:05.905 --> 01:26:07.046]  We're good to go.
[01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:32.742]  You're a prop!
[01:26:32.923 --> 01:26:33.824]  You're a prop!
[01:26:34.144 --> 01:26:36.246]  So they can claim they did a real interview.
[01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:37.127]  Exactly.
[01:26:37.287 --> 01:26:41.793]  And all they need you for is the ability to put a couple of quotation marks within their article.
[01:26:44.326 --> 01:26:44.726]  We're good to go.
[01:27:10.885 --> 01:27:11.105]  I think so.
[01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:11.445]  I think so.
[01:27:38.026 --> 01:27:38.909]  We're good to go.
[01:27:44.332 --> 01:27:51.819]  Off-field transgressions, drug abuse, marital infidelity, all the negatives about him, that's what Jeff Berlman chooses to focus on.
[01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.741]  That's the man that wrote this article about me.
[01:27:54.381 --> 01:28:10.576]  And yeah, he took a 30-minute conversation and gleaned out eight words here and half a sentence there and a few little nuggets there, slapped them on a page with his context around it, and basically fulfilled the theme that he set out to write before he ever even sat down.
[01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:27.219]  And it's disgusting, and they write, though, for a certain crowd of sports fans that really hate athletes and successful people, and they just do it so they feel good watching somebody big fall.
[01:28:27.739 --> 01:28:31.902]  And, you know, if somebody's human and has problems, I don't want to watch them fall.
[01:28:32.322 --> 01:28:38.386]  I like watching tyrants and abusers fall, but it's not a satisfaction, it's more of a, you know, knowing the bad guy's been beaten.
[01:28:43.473 --> 01:28:44.794]  I did an interview about a month ago.
[01:28:44.854 --> 01:28:47.935]  That was the first print interview I've done in probably four or five years.
[01:28:48.936 --> 01:28:51.597]  And going into it, I'm like, eh, I'm sort of grudgingly doing it.
[01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:57.740]  I gave the girl a great interview, and she was obviously from a Democratic side of the political coin.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.621]  We had great background, we had great rapport.
[01:29:01.882 --> 01:29:04.623]  The interview was what I thought was really good.
[01:29:04.643 --> 01:29:06.204]  I picked the article up and read it.
[01:29:06.224 --> 01:29:08.165]  I'm like, is that the same interview I gave?
[01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:08.585]  Really?
[01:29:08.605 --> 01:29:13.387]  And no matter what I said, no matter how good and or bad the interview, I died.
[01:29:14.395 --> 01:29:15.376]  No, see, they're cheaters.
[01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:24.021]  When I've written articles and interviews, because I'm so used to doing them live on Arab of the Years, if somebody makes a good point, I leave it in there because I want to have an interesting interview.
[01:29:24.281 --> 01:29:25.521]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:28.023]  A lot of these journalists are archetypal cowards.
[01:29:28.403 --> 01:29:33.206]  They love the median of a taped interview because they can edit it however they want.
[01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:34.947]  They can always win.
[01:29:34.967 --> 01:29:37.929]  And in their mind, they win when they make somebody
[01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:43.912]  More wealthy, more successful, with more physical prowess and mental prowess than them look bad.
[01:29:44.372 --> 01:29:45.212]  What a joke!
[01:29:45.252 --> 01:29:46.993]  We'll be right back with a long segment.
[01:29:47.353 --> 01:29:47.874]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.294 --> 01:29:50.175]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.675 --> 01:29:52.276]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.196 --> 01:29:55.918]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.936 --> 01:30:15.414]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:16.415 --> 01:30:20.099]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:33.104]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:33.864 --> 01:30:41.131]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:51.417]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:30:52.177 --> 01:30:55.459]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:30:56.119 --> 01:30:59.221]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:05.984]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:31:06.345 --> 01:31:08.746]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:31:08.946 --> 01:31:14.029]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:31:14.329 --> 01:31:19.052]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:31:19.292 --> 01:31:28.797]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now, as the price of raw ingredients increases.
[01:31:28.997 --> 01:31:29.498]  We're good to go.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.102]  Or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:59.103]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:31:59.624 --> 01:32:04.868]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:32:05.128 --> 01:32:07.310]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:13.054]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[01:32:13.234 --> 01:32:16.457]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:16.617 --> 01:32:19.800]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.481]  There's no priming required.
[01:32:21.721 --> 01:32:23.782]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:26.503]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:32:26.684 --> 01:32:28.925]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:32:29.105 --> 01:32:30.405]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:30.525 --> 01:32:33.387]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:33.707 --> 01:32:36.849]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:37.069 --> 01:32:38.870]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:41.071]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:41.211 --> 01:32:43.812]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:43.952 --> 01:32:45.273]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:45.533 --> 01:32:48.755]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure.
[01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:51.416]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[01:32:51.516 --> 01:32:54.477]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWars.com.

[01:32:56.918 --> 01:33:08.341]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.704]  John Rocker is our guest.
[01:33:17.205 --> 01:33:22.971]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to get into a bunch of news that's been breaking from the campaign trail and what's happening with the economy.
[01:33:23.812 --> 01:33:25.854]  We've got 18 minutes right now with John Rocker.
[01:33:25.874 --> 01:33:28.056]  Alright, covering the waterfront here.
[01:33:28.997 --> 01:33:30.379]  You want to get into the TSA.
[01:33:30.399 --> 01:33:31.540]  You travel quite a bit.
[01:33:32.241 --> 01:33:37.166]  What's your take on this group that seems to be looking for Al Qaeda in our underwear?
[01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:42.227]  Thank you so much.
[01:33:42.308 --> 01:33:43.689]  I'm sort of out of breath on this one.
[01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:53.977]  I think everybody can, you know, both sides of the political fence, both, you know, all angles of our society, I think, can agree.
[01:33:55.299 --> 01:33:56.540]  TSA, they're a joke.
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:58.101]  They're basically useless.
[01:33:58.161 --> 01:34:03.466]  You know, looking under grandma's wig and under, you know, an Indian grandpa's pockets.
[01:34:04.486 --> 01:34:06.208]  Obviously, that doesn't solve a whole lot.
[01:34:22.233 --> 01:34:22.633]  We're good to go.
[01:34:43.334 --> 01:34:44.235]  We're good to go.
[01:35:01.138 --> 01:35:09.491]  Well, now the TSA is expanding out to the roads, the highways, the bridges, while they basically leave the borders wide open.
[01:35:09.532 --> 01:35:10.253]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:35:10.653 --> 01:35:15.101]  What's your take on... Well, give us your view on that.
[01:35:16.547 --> 01:35:27.059]  Well, actually, I'm just hearing about it for the first time, but it is absolutely laughable to provide that much manpower for roads and bridges and things like that.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.123]  When you just hit the nail on the head, the borders are wide open.
[01:35:30.784 --> 01:35:34.729]  It's basically just a chain-link fence that anybody can just pull right on through.
[01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:43.173]  Yeah, that is actually laughable to spend that much energy, money, manpower to secure bridges.
[01:35:43.253 --> 01:35:44.794]  And obviously, maybe that needs to be done.
[01:35:44.814 --> 01:35:48.096]  The Washington Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel, things like that.
[01:35:48.196 --> 01:35:51.697]  Obviously, extremely traveled thoroughfare.
[01:35:51.717 --> 01:35:53.618]  We're talking about coming in and out of New York City.
[01:35:54.138 --> 01:35:55.639]  Definitely safety, some kind of safety
[01:35:56.079 --> 01:35:58.800]  Yeah, but you don't have feds who aren't even police doing it.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.841]  And obviously cameras and things can do that.
[01:36:01.861 --> 01:36:03.862]  The point is it's a giant power grab.
[01:36:03.882 --> 01:36:05.922]  What's your view on Fast and Furious?
[01:36:05.962 --> 01:36:08.163]  I mean, they've been caught shipping the guns into Mexico.
[01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:10.784]  They've been caught using it to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:36:12.316 --> 01:36:19.200]  Yeah, and if you're not doing anything that you don't want the American people to know about, turn over the documents.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.320]  I mean, how hard is this?
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.622]  I mean, Executive Privilege, we've been trying to get you for better than six months now.
[01:36:25.203 --> 01:36:27.143]  Stories seem to change on a weekly basis.
[01:36:27.664 --> 01:36:35.988]  If you're not doing anything that you need to hide, turn over the X number of hundred documents that the Congressional Committee wants to see, wants to be done with it.
[01:36:36.368 --> 01:36:39.990]  You know, try to play the race card and, you know, now we tell you how easy the exertion
[01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:44.414]  I mean, we're dancing around things that should be non-issues.
[01:36:44.434 --> 01:36:46.856]  If there's nothing to hide, let's see the documents.
[01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:48.237]  Let the American public know it.
[01:36:48.257 --> 01:36:54.343]  Let the Congressional Committee have their day in the hearing and say, okay, we've investigated.
[01:36:54.363 --> 01:36:55.785]  No harm, no foul.
[01:36:55.825 --> 01:36:56.605]  Wash our hands clean.
[01:36:56.625 --> 01:36:57.306]  Let's move on.
[01:37:04.079 --> 01:37:10.841]  Have you heard the quote from the Vice President saying that if they vote for Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney that they're going to have chains back on them?
[01:37:29.269 --> 01:37:35.314]  You know, every time you think you're making some headway, you know, on the social side of the fence.
[01:37:35.334 --> 01:37:41.259]  Race relations, you know, meaning of race relations and unifying and becoming a more cohesive America.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:49.567]  Moving forward where we can, you know, look past these, you know, these differences in nationalities and skin pigmentation and things like that.
[01:37:50.367 --> 01:37:54.431]  Some boo comes up with a comment like that and just drives that nail home once again.
[01:37:55.117 --> 01:38:09.081]  Well sure, but my point is, they go after you for statements that were a lot milder than that racially, and then you've got Obama, the Chicago organizer, Reverend Wright, with all this pure race stuff, and then Biden obviously using racial politics.
[01:38:09.401 --> 01:38:13.922]  Why is it okay for the so-called liberals to do this all day?
[01:38:15.342 --> 01:38:24.505]  Well, when you have 80% of the media being of a liberal mindset, and what you were just talking about, going in that way of, I guess,
[01:38:26.408 --> 01:38:27.629]  We're good to go.
[01:38:49.702 --> 01:38:50.763]  They're going to take this to grief.
[01:38:51.003 --> 01:38:53.165]  They're the ones that are going to be hammering it.
[01:38:53.225 --> 01:39:05.617]  If you're preaching to the choir, the people are going to be getting the message out and getting the word out, but they're not going to get it out in that fashion unless you're someone like me that sort of goes against the mainstream, what the mainstream media, their false ideals.
[01:39:06.098 --> 01:39:11.423]  They're going to turn on you pretty quick if you're speaking in the same vein that they speak and they think in.
[01:39:11.803 --> 01:39:13.825]  They're just going to go right along with you and give you carte blanche.
[01:39:16.215 --> 01:39:20.219]  What is your take on Mitt Romney shifting in another area?
[01:39:20.239 --> 01:39:26.424]  I mean, he has a very, you know, globalist, big government-type voting record as governor.
[01:39:26.945 --> 01:39:38.415]  And the policy supported restricting guns, open borders, helped write what became Obamacare, supported No Child Left Behind, supported carbon taxes, Al Gore-type stuff.
[01:39:39.256 --> 01:39:43.258]  I mean, what do you do when you've got Obama who's so bad, and then you've got Mitt Romney?
[01:39:43.518 --> 01:39:45.219]  I mean, is it a lesser of two evils?
[01:39:45.259 --> 01:39:48.140]  I mean, I have to say, Paul Ryan has been anti-abortion.
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.421]  He has been pro-Second Amendment.
[01:39:49.881 --> 01:39:58.045]  So that overall is a good thing, but then I get upset about the Republicans supporting Patriot Act and things that are really being used on the American people.
[01:39:59.505 --> 01:40:00.366]  I'm right there with you.
[01:40:03.459 --> 01:40:03.859]  We're good to go.
[01:40:22.987 --> 01:40:23.927]  Which we didn't build.
[01:40:24.328 --> 01:40:32.591]  You know, the people that think with our mindset and our mind frames, our ideologies will take Mitt Romney all day long over Barack Obama.
[01:40:32.651 --> 01:40:34.112]  He definitely is a lesser of two evils.
[01:40:34.966 --> 01:40:45.771]  My only issue is, if Obama was in again, I think this country would wake up so much it'd be over for that whole globalist, communist, fascist... I think right now they're just going to take some heavy lifting.
[01:40:45.791 --> 01:40:49.753]  I still think we can kind of change the tide, change the course we're on.
[01:40:50.173 --> 01:40:56.116]  It's going to take, you know, a big fat parking brake to get us there, turn around, reverse, go in the other direction.
[01:40:56.136 --> 01:41:03.600]  I think if we had, you know, three or four more years of that, I think this shit would be too far underwater to ride it at that point.
[01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:05.350]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.530 --> 01:41:06.891]  Well, that's the debate.
[01:41:06.931 --> 01:41:10.534]  Let things get really bad and then America totally swings the other way towards freedom.
[01:41:11.074 --> 01:41:14.057]  Or, would it be so bad, Obama could stage something.
[01:41:14.077 --> 01:41:19.982]  I mean, if they'd stage Fast and Furious, as Larry Pratt said a few weeks ago from Gun Owners of America, they would stage anything.
[01:41:20.943 --> 01:41:24.445]  I've got some other political questions for you, but let's go to another area.
[01:41:24.525 --> 01:41:27.088]  You're about to start a national speaking tour.
[01:41:27.808 --> 01:41:33.553]  And in fact, if people want to read what you're actually writing and saying instead of what the media is spinning, it's johnrocker.net.
[01:41:33.593 --> 01:41:34.714]  Is that a good website to visit?
[01:41:36.315 --> 01:41:36.816]  Yeah, it is.
[01:41:36.836 --> 01:41:38.457]  I don't update that site a whole lot.
[01:41:38.577 --> 01:41:41.579]  It does have my speak English mission statement on there.
[01:41:41.599 --> 01:41:46.783]  Of course, my books are available there amongst the Amazons and Barnes and Nobles and places like that.
[01:41:47.324 --> 01:41:49.605]  I think the best place is probably World Net Daily.
[01:41:50.106 --> 01:41:51.587]  My column comes out every Tuesday.
[01:41:51.627 --> 01:41:55.950]  I kind of have, like I said earlier, a card blotch to kind of write about whatever I want to write about.
[01:41:56.851 --> 01:42:05.778]  This past Tuesday I wrote about the fracturing of America, basically speaking about, I guess, the lack of emphasis that's put on the family structure.
[01:42:06.158 --> 01:42:06.818]  We're good to go.
[01:42:34.747 --> 01:42:54.597]  Looking at the world in general, geopolitically, nobody was a fan of Qaddafi or even Assad, but they had been working with the West and not stirring stuff up, and it had actually kind of come in out of the cold, and then now Obama and NATO and others, I'm sure you saw the controversy a few months ago where the Joint Chiefs told Congress that
[01:42:55.097 --> 01:43:00.399]  The UN and NATO is now over our military and Congress seem to sit there and take it.
[01:43:00.899 --> 01:43:09.102]  Have you seen the reports where they admit Al-Qaeda is the main force that NATO is aiding in Libya, taking it over, and now in Syria?
[01:43:10.363 --> 01:43:12.123]  I have seen that to some degree.
[01:43:12.143 --> 01:43:15.325]  I've been following it real closely, but yeah, to some degree I have.
[01:43:15.345 --> 01:43:16.785]  I've been reading those reports, yes.
[01:43:16.805 --> 01:43:18.886]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:21.207]  That sounds pretty crazy to me.
[01:43:22.295 --> 01:43:30.258]  Yeah, but there again, over in that region, I guess you're trying to align yourself with the least crazy faction.
[01:43:30.298 --> 01:43:30.998]  Who's worse?
[01:43:31.119 --> 01:43:31.559]  Al Qaeda?
[01:43:31.619 --> 01:43:32.739]  Or is it Hamas?
[01:43:33.019 --> 01:43:34.920]  Or is it the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.261]  I mean, who do you pick?
[01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:44.604]  You've got to align yourself with someone, someone that maybe you can work with, and a little more malleable, and you can try to establish some kind of a relationship with.
[01:43:45.128 --> 01:43:47.030]  Yeah, that was Gaddafi and Assad.
[01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:49.512]  I mean, they admit Al-Qaeda is the craziest bunch.
[01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:52.155]  So why is Obama aligning with Al-Qaeda?
[01:43:53.376 --> 01:43:53.756]  Who knows?
[01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:55.358]  Why would he do half the things he does?
[01:43:55.898 --> 01:43:59.262]  I have no idea what makes that man tick, what flows through his head.
[01:43:59.322 --> 01:43:59.862]  You never know.
[01:44:01.664 --> 01:44:04.046]  Yeah, it's super, super creepy.
[01:44:07.699 --> 01:44:13.262]  I know we sit on my little website every Tuesday and obviously we have a very successful radio show.
[01:44:13.562 --> 01:44:17.484]  And we talk and we rant and we voice our opinions and we question everybody.
[01:44:18.724 --> 01:44:22.266]  And I sort of liken that to a political campaign.
[01:44:22.306 --> 01:44:26.307]  When Obama was running four years ago, when Romney's running now, they say they're going to do this.
[01:44:26.447 --> 01:44:30.009]  And particularly amongst foreign policy, it's very difficult I think.
[01:44:31.886 --> 01:44:32.486]  We're good to go.
[01:45:04.718 --> 01:45:07.469]  I want to be now, not candidate anymore, but now president.
[01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:09.677]  Just watch the look on his face going...
[01:45:11.118 --> 01:45:11.478]  Really?
[01:45:12.298 --> 01:45:21.261]  I would love to really be in the CIA meeting, in the covert meeting room, and really know exactly when we were sitting there saying, why are they lying with Al Qaeda?
[01:45:21.621 --> 01:45:22.741]  I would love to know this.
[01:45:22.801 --> 01:45:24.242]  I mean, Barack Obama's not an idiot.
[01:45:24.262 --> 01:45:24.902]  I mean, he's really not.
[01:45:24.922 --> 01:45:33.745]  And obviously, you know, policy-wise, on several, you know, main frames of policy, we certainly don't agree with each other, so I don't see eye to eye, but he's certainly not a dumb man.
[01:45:34.105 --> 01:45:35.285]  Why would he do something like that?
[01:45:35.305 --> 01:45:38.566]  There definitely has to be more than the human eye meets
[01:45:39.407 --> 01:45:40.468]  Well, sure, I know why.
[01:45:40.488 --> 01:45:42.149]  I mean, I wanted your take.
[01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:50.438]  I mean, I've had a bunch of top geopolitical analysts and people that formerly headed up the State Department, Black Ops, like Steve Pchenik, Dr. Pchenik, a few days ago.
[01:45:50.998 --> 01:45:56.764]  The reason is they want to get a Sunni-Shiite civil war going so the Arabs all kill each other.
[01:45:56.784 --> 01:45:59.947]  And that sounds like a very immoral thing to me.
[01:46:00.007 --> 01:46:02.389]  It's one thing people say, oh, it's a class parking lot and all this.
[01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:09.676]  Letting Al Qaeda take over these countries and overthrow Western dictators that had actually been a stabilizing force.
[01:46:09.716 --> 01:46:10.737]  I'm not defending Mubarak.
[01:46:11.117 --> 01:46:13.279]  Putting it in the Muslim Brotherhood has made it worse.
[01:46:13.719 --> 01:46:14.620]  For women, you name it.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:21.686]  I mean, if we claim we're against all that extremism, then actually putting it in to wreck things is very, very cold-blooded.
[01:46:22.006 --> 01:46:25.069]  People say, Obama must be a Muslim, he's putting Al Qaeda in.
[01:46:25.389 --> 01:46:27.651]  No, he's putting them in there to destroy those countries.
[01:46:30.908 --> 01:46:32.229]  You know, 3,000 year history.
[01:46:32.249 --> 01:46:35.512]  Do you really have to make an effort to get those people to fight with each other?
[01:46:35.532 --> 01:46:37.093]  I mean, you really don't.
[01:46:37.333 --> 01:46:38.134]  No, exactly!
[01:46:38.194 --> 01:46:42.797]  So if you ship them a bunch of arms and weapons and inject them in there, they're gonna blow the place up.
[01:46:43.097 --> 01:46:46.080]  No, I mean... They're gonna do that anyway.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.260]  It doesn't matter who's in charge.
[01:46:49.551 --> 01:47:03.081]  Yeah, but I mean, I think, John, that's where this comes from, is that they've just written off all those poor people over there, and every time they try to have a secular government, or a government that builds up their nation, the West goes and puts radicals in.
[01:47:03.121 --> 01:47:05.483]  That's what the British have been doing for a hundred years.
[01:47:07.805 --> 01:47:13.408]  It's a program of divide and conquer, and you know, it's a very dangerous policy.
[01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:16.950]  I don't think you agree with that policy, do you?
[01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:18.270]  Oh, absolutely not.
[01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:22.452]  I'm not even going to claim to be a student on the philosophies and ideologies of
[01:47:33.848 --> 01:47:36.055]  I don't think so.
[01:47:43.228 --> 01:47:43.988]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:47:44.148 --> 01:47:44.608]  I hear you.
[01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:47.730]  It is a mess, but I mean, look at Europe and its constant wars with each other.
[01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:52.131]  I mean, this is, I think this is more of a human mess, but I do see what you're saying.
[01:47:52.151 --> 01:47:53.592]  I just want to somehow figure out peace.
[01:47:54.092 --> 01:48:00.314]  In closing, I want to talk a little bit about the tour coming up, the specifics, how people find out about that, trying to empower communities.
[01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:01.734]  Very laudable goal there.
[01:48:01.914 --> 01:48:06.456]  John Rocker, famous, obvious baseball player, is our guest here.
[01:48:07.616 --> 01:48:10.217]  What do you see happening if Obama gets back in?
[01:48:10.277 --> 01:48:12.338]  Because if he's already engaged in all this
[01:48:13.462 --> 01:48:14.583]  Criminal stuff so far.
[01:48:15.123 --> 01:48:17.144]  What do you think he'll do if he gets back in, John Rocker?
[01:48:18.684 --> 01:48:21.566]  Obviously, there's a massive runaway debt that will continue.
[01:48:21.966 --> 01:48:23.387]  The class warfare will continue.
[01:48:24.167 --> 01:48:25.968]  Socialism will begin.
[01:48:26.008 --> 01:48:31.010]  The blanket socialism, I think, it's already begun, will continue to spread over our country.
[01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:35.832]  I think by the time he's out of office in four years, I think he'll have 70 to 80 plus percent of people
[01:48:41.005 --> 01:48:44.887]  And why do you think the collectivists want to discriminate wealth and happiness?
[01:48:44.967 --> 01:48:47.809]  Everywhere they take over, they create living hells.
[01:49:03.847 --> 01:49:10.130]  I think it comes from just a sheer simple fact of a bleeding heart.
[01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:11.910]  They feel sorry for everyone.
[01:49:12.711 --> 01:49:16.312]  They want to reach out to those who supposedly can't do for themselves.
[01:49:17.113 --> 01:49:25.536]  They have a real defeatist attitude as far as the actual ingenuity, capability, and ability of the human man and woman.
[01:49:26.916 --> 01:49:29.618]  And they just think everybody needs to be taken care of.
[01:49:30.658 --> 01:49:37.080]  Obviously look down on those that have excelled and succeeded, but somehow as Barack Obama said a couple weeks ago, you didn't do that yourself.
[01:49:37.941 --> 01:49:41.582]  I'll tell you this right now, nobody got me to the big leagues except me.
[01:49:43.203 --> 01:49:47.184]  All the companies I've started, the developments I've done, nobody has done those except me.
[01:49:47.204 --> 01:49:49.265]  Sure, I have people that are working for me and things like that.
[01:49:49.645 --> 01:49:53.227]  I couldn't have done it without some of my employees and that kind of stuff, but at the end of the day,
[01:49:55.173 --> 01:50:01.314]  90% of what got done, I was the one- Sure, the attack on the individual is what every collectivist do.
[01:50:01.374 --> 01:50:08.536]  It's directly out of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and it does show the crazy disconnect, I mean a total disconnect with reality.
[01:50:09.056 --> 01:50:21.139]  Exactly, and those that have not done that, those that have not looked out for themselves, they beat down people like me and you that have risen above, and in true gumption and in blood, sweat, and tears have gotten what we've gotten.
[01:50:21.479 --> 01:50:23.379]  Somehow we've cheated, somehow we've stepped on
[01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:40.083]  Sure, they don't want the little guys to know they can reach up, so they've got to pull anybody who's successful down.
[01:50:40.743 --> 01:50:48.485]  And they're getting ready to try to take everything that producers have made, so they're telling the disenfranchised who they want to keep down that we're the bad guys.
[01:50:48.525 --> 01:50:51.266]  John Rocker, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:50:51.306 --> 01:50:54.307]  The book, Scars and Strikes, available everywhere.
[01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:55.988]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:50:57.742 --> 01:50:58.743]  Alright, we'll come back with more news.
[01:50:58.763 --> 01:50:59.263]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.625 --> 01:51:07.430]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:12.594]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:12.914 --> 01:51:14.636]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:15.096 --> 01:51:22.382]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:22.862 --> 01:51:26.184]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:51:26.564 --> 01:51:30.446]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:30.826 --> 01:51:37.089]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:51:37.509 --> 01:51:40.070]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:40.471 --> 01:51:42.972]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:43.492 --> 01:51:46.854]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:49.555]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:50.075 --> 01:51:54.718]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:51:55.058 --> 01:51:57.280]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[01:53:55.329 --> 01:53:57.354]  Save fuel, save money, save Earth!
[01:54:16.428 --> 01:54:28.459]  We are going to do a full hour breaking down every vitamin and mineral and what is admitted mainline medical science, what those deficiencies cause, what illnesses, what diseases.
[01:54:30.962 --> 01:54:36.147]  This is going to be incredibly informative because I've actually pre-planned this interview.
[01:54:37.802 --> 01:54:39.163]  As a special presentation.
[01:54:40.104 --> 01:54:42.385]  So we'll do the full hour with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[01:54:42.405 --> 01:54:45.447]  I always call him Doc Fuchs because he knows so much.
[01:54:46.688 --> 01:54:48.309]  Compounding pharmacist of 20 years.
[01:54:48.889 --> 01:54:50.410]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:54.373]  Remember a year and a half ago, Fukushima, and they told you there's no radiation.
[01:54:54.753 --> 01:54:56.374]  And it did later come out in mainstream news.
[01:54:56.394 --> 01:55:00.157]  They'd covered up the real level of radiation, including what's hitting the US.
[01:55:01.878 --> 01:55:03.819]  And their answer is more reactors.
[01:55:04.502 --> 01:55:10.245]  And again, I understand nuclear power could be a good source, but the companies won't run them safely.
[01:55:10.285 --> 01:55:11.925]  They won't store the waste safely.
[01:55:12.325 --> 01:55:13.606]  They won't go to new designs.
[01:55:13.626 --> 01:55:20.209]  They've got a bunch of 35, 40-year-old reactors that are rotting because the radiation eats through everything.
[01:55:22.176 --> 01:55:26.398]  They're rotting, the heat, the steam, the radiation, and they're going off.
[01:55:26.458 --> 01:55:35.741]  I mean, I saw a statistic, 91%, you can look this up, just type in 90, actually the headline's 90, 90% of reactors are leaking.
[01:55:36.601 --> 01:55:42.843]  Of the 400 and something worldwide, it's right at 90, it's almost 91, if you round up, I think it's 90.7.
[01:55:44.524 --> 01:55:48.025]  I don't think, that's the number, 90.7 in a study done last year are leaking, 90.7.
[01:55:51.082 --> 01:55:53.424]  90.7.
[01:55:52.904 --> 01:55:53.424]  90.7 are leaking.
[01:55:53.805 --> 01:55:54.165]  Leaking!
[01:55:54.185 --> 01:55:55.326]  And it's like, oh well!
[01:55:55.987 --> 01:55:56.688]  You know what?
[01:55:57.008 --> 01:55:59.091]  Out in San Diego, we have a leaking reactor.
[01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:02.114]  We're just not going to have the alarms go off anymore, they said a few months ago.
[01:56:02.635 --> 01:56:05.278]  When it leaks, the alarms scare everybody.
[01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:09.702]  There is a leak, a leak.
[01:56:10.343 --> 01:56:11.745]  Oh, we're just going to turn that off now.
[01:56:12.918 --> 01:56:17.979]  It's just this attitude by the establishment, by everybody, just, oh, you know what?
[01:56:18.019 --> 01:56:21.880]  We had dozens of GMOs and they're linked to all the sterilization and the rest of it.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.481]  We're just going to come out with hundreds of crops now.
[01:56:25.521 --> 01:56:26.601]  Hundreds of crops.
[01:56:27.661 --> 01:56:28.341]  Never mind.
[01:56:29.202 --> 01:56:30.922]  Never mind the bugs that eat it, die.
[01:56:31.062 --> 01:56:31.962]  It's good for you.
[01:56:32.662 --> 01:56:33.763]  Never mind all the studies.
[01:56:34.323 --> 01:56:35.083]  Oh, you know what?
[01:56:35.303 --> 01:56:38.704]  Harvard does admit in their big study, fluoride is brain damaging you.
[01:56:39.284 --> 01:56:39.764]  So what?
[01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:44.454]  Hey, Fukushima caused mutant butterflies, French news agency.
[01:56:45.616 --> 01:56:46.978]  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:56:47.038 --> 01:56:48.299]  I mean, look what it did for Spider-Man.
[01:56:49.414 --> 01:57:01.477]  Yeah, my buddy Shane Steiner was, he was telling me the name of the movie, I forget the name of it, he was telling me the story of like, yeah, the guy goes and rolls in toxic waste, he thinks it'll make him Superman, and really he just gives leukemia in some comedy he was watching.
[01:57:01.717 --> 01:57:03.378]  But it's not funny when it's the real world.
[01:57:03.838 --> 01:57:11.960]  Genetic mutations have been found in three generations of butterflies from near Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:17.662]  Scientists said Tuesday, raising fears radiation could affect other species.
[01:57:18.562 --> 01:57:22.164]  But George Mambia, who wants to reduce world population, is a Bilderberg minion.
[01:57:22.204 --> 01:57:23.025]  He says it's good.
[01:57:23.045 --> 01:57:27.608]  I mean, Ann Coulter said they ought to thank the Japanese government and TEPCO.
[01:57:28.188 --> 01:57:34.632]  Even though a bunch of people have dropped dead, you have cardiac arrest, and their teeth are bleeding, there's radiation deaths all over Japan.
[01:57:35.233 --> 01:57:36.634]  You should thank them.
[01:57:36.654 --> 01:57:39.055]  Because Ann Coulter said so.
[01:57:39.696 --> 01:57:40.156]  Around 12% of
[01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:44.632]  Well, what's wrong with that?
[01:57:44.652 --> 01:57:48.316]  I mean, we're getting massive cancer increases and deformities and debilitations, the troops are.
[01:58:03.633 --> 01:58:08.059]  Well, it's a 14-fold increase in deformities if you use DU in major studies.
[01:58:08.079 --> 01:58:11.163]  But, hey, you know, troops, they're gonna have you use DU.
[01:58:11.523 --> 01:58:13.025]  It ignites in the barrel.
[01:58:13.045 --> 01:58:13.726]  But you're tough.
[01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:14.307]  You're tough.
[01:58:14.968 --> 01:58:17.211]  Yeah, you're gonna die of kidney failure and lung cancer early.
[01:58:17.231 --> 01:58:20.094]  And, hey, you're babies, you know.
[01:58:21.325 --> 01:58:23.987]  We'll have horrific deformities, but so what?
[01:58:24.888 --> 01:58:26.629]  It's not patriotic to complain.
[01:58:27.529 --> 01:58:29.451]  And Butterfly shouldn't complain either.
[01:58:29.771 --> 01:58:33.774]  All the kids dropping dead in Japanese schoolyards from heart failure from the radiation.
[01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:35.655]  Shouldn't worry about it.
[01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:37.396]  They'll be right back.

[01:58:50.367 --> 01:58:53.589]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:59.454]  It is a nanocatalytic silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[01:58:59.834 --> 01:59:02.856]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[01:59:03.156 --> 01:59:09.461]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[01:59:09.961 --> 01:59:17.547]  Silversol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[01:59:17.947 --> 01:59:23.592]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[01:59:24.092 --> 01:59:30.838]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[01:59:31.238 --> 01:59:33.420]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.482]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[01:59:55.316 --> 01:59:58.078]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.741 --> 02:00:08.944]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.564 --> 02:00:10.385]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.185 --> 02:00:12.146]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.726 --> 02:00:16.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.929 --> 02:00:20.991]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.044 --> 02:00:47.030]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a very special presentation lined up for you in the next 60 minutes.
[02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:53.415]  And I'm presenting this not because I think it, but because I know it, and I've seen the dramatic results.
[02:00:53.615 --> 02:00:56.778]  And this is a major revolution against the globalists.
[02:00:57.098 --> 02:00:58.739]  Getting the fluoride out of the water is?
[02:00:59.872 --> 02:01:01.352]  Well, I'm going to talk more about it later in the hour.
[02:01:01.412 --> 02:01:04.453]  Getting the GMO out of our lives that they're trying to assault us with.
[02:01:05.053 --> 02:01:10.134]  But the trace elements, minerals, and vitamins, when you get it all together, it helps battle all the other stuff.
[02:01:10.414 --> 02:01:13.875]  But they want you sick, the medical system, Big Pharma, they don't want you to know.
[02:01:15.215 --> 02:01:18.056]  They know, they knew when the 20 sodium fluoride brain damaged you.
[02:01:18.336 --> 02:01:21.217]  They know MSG is toxic and causes neurological disorders.
[02:01:21.977 --> 02:01:25.297]  And they know that most of these illnesses are mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[02:01:26.458 --> 02:01:27.178]  Well, joining us
[02:01:28.277 --> 02:01:31.780]  He is a pharmacist, compounding pharmacist of more than 20 years, Ben Fuchs.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.563]  He's a syndicated radio host here on the GCN Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:01:36.344 --> 02:01:40.387]  And he joins us, he's part of InfoWarsTeam.com as well, and one of our advisors.
[02:01:40.867 --> 02:01:46.952]  We've got medical doctors, veterinarians, naturopaths, all advising us at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:01:46.972 --> 02:01:49.234]  You can see those videos posted there in Aaron's testimonial.
[02:01:49.494 --> 02:01:51.416]  But that's not why this is here today.
[02:01:51.436 --> 02:01:53.117]  That's not why we're covering this.
[02:01:53.177 --> 02:01:56.119]  We are going to engage in the public service.
[02:01:57.282 --> 02:01:59.323]  Of going through everything.
[02:02:00.403 --> 02:02:12.226]  Of going through all the vitamins, all the minerals, and then trace elements, just bam, bam, bam, quickly, and then we can go back through other issues that the system doesn't want you to know.
[02:02:12.247 --> 02:02:18.648]  I had a family member who I noticed was only drinking Coca-Colas about five years ago.
[02:02:18.728 --> 02:02:23.810]  They were old, they were pretty much gonna die, and I just begged him, I said, if you will just start drinking water,
[02:02:25.933 --> 02:02:32.474]  Your body, you're dehydrated because Coca-Cola and things, and iced tea, you name it, is what is it called?
[02:02:32.514 --> 02:02:33.455]  A diuretic.
[02:02:33.515 --> 02:02:34.555]  It makes you urinate.
[02:02:35.595 --> 02:02:37.795]  You drink 20 ounces, you urinate 25 ounces.
[02:02:38.275 --> 02:02:40.656]  I said, you look like beef jerky, you gotta drink water.
[02:02:40.956 --> 02:02:43.737]  And they got mad at me and started drinking water and looked like a new person.
[02:02:45.237 --> 02:02:46.477]  Again, it's like simple.
[02:02:46.517 --> 02:02:48.658]  Your teeth will fall out and old wounds will open up.
[02:02:48.918 --> 02:02:50.438]  Your hair will fall out if you don't get vitamin C.
[02:02:52.150 --> 02:02:55.793]  We've got these food deserts out there, not just in poor areas, everywhere.
[02:02:56.733 --> 02:02:58.935]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joins us after this break.
[02:02:58.995 --> 02:03:01.217]  He is waiting in the wings right now.
[02:03:01.557 --> 02:03:04.139]  In fact, Pharmacist Ben, we've got two minutes until we've got a break.
[02:03:04.359 --> 02:03:05.420]  Tell us what's coming up today.
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:08.022]  You've lined up an incredible presentation.
[02:03:09.355 --> 02:03:10.676]  Well, I've got lots of stuff to talk about.
[02:03:10.696 --> 02:03:11.816]  Thank you for the intro, Alex.
[02:03:11.856 --> 02:03:12.817]  Thank you for the kind words.
[02:03:12.837 --> 02:03:14.077]  There's a lot of stuff in the news.
[02:03:15.718 --> 02:03:18.719]  I like the Consumer Reports article that came out a couple of weeks ago.
[02:03:18.799 --> 02:03:21.480]  Ten surprising dangers of vitamins and supplements.
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:23.041]  I'd love to be able to address that.
[02:03:23.481 --> 02:03:27.183]  There was a study that came out, I think it was last week, in the Journal of Nature Medicine.
[02:03:27.223 --> 02:03:30.164]  Chemotherapy can actually cause cancer.
[02:03:30.224 --> 02:03:31.725]  I thought that was pretty fascinating.
[02:03:32.866 --> 02:03:36.028]  Let's see, statin drugs linked with development of cataracts.
[02:03:36.208 --> 02:03:37.869]  What else do you want to talk about here, Alex?
[02:03:37.909 --> 02:03:49.057]  There's the sugary drink ban in New York and the digital pill they want you to swallow that will give doctors the real-time scoop on what's happening inside your body.
[02:03:49.098 --> 02:03:50.338]  That could be kind of interesting.
[02:03:50.679 --> 02:03:52.260]  How about Dennis wanting us to drink
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:53.560]  More fluoride.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.381]  They don't like bottled water because people aren't getting enough fluoride.
[02:03:56.401 --> 02:03:57.422]  We can talk about that too.
[02:03:57.902 --> 02:03:59.062]  Lots of stuff here we can talk about.
[02:03:59.102 --> 02:04:01.603]  Diabetes drugs raise the risk of bladder cancer.
[02:04:01.643 --> 02:04:03.424]  Statin drugs raise the risk of diabetes.
[02:04:03.444 --> 02:04:04.324]  There's tons of good stuff.
[02:04:04.384 --> 02:04:07.425]  I want to go over all those studies, but I heard your show a few days ago.
[02:04:07.505 --> 02:04:09.466]  It was even, it was just a couple days ago.
[02:04:10.996 --> 02:04:20.682]  And you were going over just this mineral when you have this deficiency does this, this vitamin deficiency does that, this pancreatic problem caused by this, and the system knows that.
[02:04:20.762 --> 02:04:27.507]  So, you know, we talked a few days ago and you sent a whole big rundown of documents and articles and studies.
[02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:33.391]  And so I want to go over just at first the different vitamins.
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:44.550]  And then what those deficiencies do, different minerals, what is needed, what the really cool cofactors are, trace elements, things like that with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:04:44.591 --> 02:04:48.334]  And then we'll get into all those news items that you just mentioned straight ahead.
[02:04:48.775 --> 02:04:52.138]  I'm Alex Jones with pharmacist Ben Fuchs, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:04:52.198 --> 02:04:54.200]  He's got our latest videos up there right now.
[02:05:02.193 --> 02:05:09.879]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:10.319 --> 02:05:13.942]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:14.382 --> 02:05:21.207]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:05:21.688 --> 02:05:24.510]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:24.710 --> 02:05:29.212]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:05:29.552 --> 02:05:35.214]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:40.595]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:05:40.896 --> 02:05:42.516]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:42.876 --> 02:05:47.418]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:48.098 --> 02:05:51.307]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:05:59.810 --> 02:06:05.955]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:06:06.316 --> 02:06:08.718]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:06:08.918 --> 02:06:14.022]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:06:14.302 --> 02:06:19.026]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:06:19.267 --> 02:06:26.573]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:06:26.893 --> 02:06:30.594]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices, too.
[02:06:30.774 --> 02:06:32.335]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:06:32.555 --> 02:06:36.416]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:06:36.577 --> 02:06:39.217]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[02:06:39.498 --> 02:06:42.118]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:06:42.259 --> 02:06:46.700]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:47.360]  Don't wait!
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.341]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:49.361 --> 02:06:49.501]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:56.584 --> 02:07:06.387]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:07:06.727 --> 02:07:11.669]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:07:11.989 --> 02:07:13.770]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:21.693]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:07:22.213 --> 02:07:25.636]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:07:26.036 --> 02:07:29.999]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:36.805]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:07:37.245 --> 02:07:39.867]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:07:40.287 --> 02:07:42.849]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:46.853]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:07:47.113 --> 02:07:49.615]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:07:50.136 --> 02:07:54.945]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:07:55.245 --> 02:07:57.129]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:08:04.773 --> 02:08:08.997]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:09.617 --> 02:08:10.438]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.199 --> 02:08:12.059]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:16.343]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.944 --> 02:08:21.007]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.210 --> 02:08:27.093]  Well, he's back by popular demand.
[02:08:27.294 --> 02:08:28.595]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:28.675 --> 02:08:34.761]  I'm Alex Jones on this Wednesday, 15th day of August 2012 edition.
[02:08:35.322 --> 02:08:42.490]  Compounding pharmacist Ben Fuchs will be with us for the rest of the hour, syndicated radio host and an advisor to Infowarsteam.com.
[02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:52.014]  And we're going to get later into the fact they want to put statin drugs in the water, they want to put more fluoride in food for kids, even though the government admits it's killing them.
[02:08:52.814 --> 02:08:56.216]  They're saying don't eat yolk and eggs, it's more dangerous than smoking.
[02:08:56.556 --> 02:08:57.697]  Now they want to tax that.
[02:08:58.678 --> 02:09:00.919]  Just all of this incredible nanny state.
[02:09:00.959 --> 02:09:02.580]  Meanwhile, big pharma, big medical.
[02:09:03.690 --> 02:09:16.227]  notes that most illnesses, in their own documents, and we have them right here, we're going to go over them today, that their own documents show that they know that most diseases are vitamin, mineral, trace element, and cofactor deficiencies.
[02:09:17.554 --> 02:09:19.355]  They know why pancreatic cancer is way up.
[02:09:19.375 --> 02:09:20.956]  They know why type 2 diabetes is way up.
[02:09:21.196 --> 02:09:22.456]  They know why cancer is way up.
[02:09:22.757 --> 02:09:29.860]  They knew the 20 sodium fluoride and other forms of fluoride put in the water causes seven-fold increase in bone cancer alone and reduced IQ.
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:37.043]  Harvard came out last week in a decades-plus long study and said, combining a whole bunch of other studies, and said, yeah, this is happening.
[02:09:37.244 --> 02:09:37.744]  They know!
[02:09:37.844 --> 02:09:38.704]  They know it all!
[02:09:39.625 --> 02:09:40.265]  They know!
[02:09:40.625 --> 02:09:41.786]  The average doctor does it.
[02:09:41.806 --> 02:09:42.986]  They just follow what they're told.
[02:09:43.267 --> 02:09:45.808]  But this is a real revolution against tyranny.
[02:09:46.636 --> 02:10:03.929]  Just like the British, and I've told this story many times, 300 plus years ago, their Academy of Sciences, their Royal Academy, discovered whatever was in green vegetables and fruits, vitamin C later discovered, but they knew if you had that, your old wounds didn't open up, you stayed healthy, your teeth didn't fall out with scurvy.
[02:10:04.589 --> 02:10:10.134]  So all the other navies, the French, the Spanish, they made fun of them and called them limeys.
[02:10:11.958 --> 02:10:13.958]  And they made fun of Germans because they ate kraut.
[02:10:14.639 --> 02:10:15.639]  Ho ho, you eat kraut.
[02:10:15.759 --> 02:10:16.619]  Ho ho, you eat limes.
[02:10:17.039 --> 02:10:17.779]  Limeys.
[02:10:18.439 --> 02:10:19.640]  Brits are called limeys.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:25.001]  But their navy was able to take over because of vitamin C. The system knows this.
[02:10:25.061 --> 02:10:30.282]  So they want you to have adulterated food with all these toxic additives.
[02:10:31.242 --> 02:10:33.242]  Hundreds of things you eat at different fast food places.
[02:10:33.422 --> 02:10:37.683]  Hundreds of fried confections have on record
[02:10:39.378 --> 02:10:39.978]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:40.678]  Appreciate it.
[02:10:59.537 --> 02:11:01.178]  You've got the floor, start breaking it down.
[02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:06.363]  Okay, yeah, well it's interesting that you brought up vitamin C first, because truly, vitamin C is the king of vitamins.
[02:11:06.383 --> 02:11:14.791]  It's so, so fundamental to health, it's pretty much impossible to think of a disease state or a breakdown state that vitamin C doesn't improve.
[02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:20.496]  The first thing that comes to mind with vitamin C deficiency is what you said, scurvy, but what's really important to understand about scurvy
[02:11:21.096 --> 02:11:24.357]  Is the fact that you can have sub-clinical scurvy.
[02:11:24.397 --> 02:11:26.418]  By the time scurvy hits, you're in big trouble.
[02:11:26.898 --> 02:11:28.779]  But scurvy doesn't all of a sudden happen.
[02:11:28.859 --> 02:11:29.979]  Scurvy builds up.
[02:11:30.059 --> 02:11:33.780]  Scurvy is basically a disease where the body destroys itself.
[02:11:34.181 --> 02:11:37.042]  The body's main connective tissue protein is called collagen.
[02:11:37.502 --> 02:11:40.783]  Without vitamin C, you cannot make collagen.
[02:11:40.923 --> 02:11:41.423]  Period.
[02:11:41.723 --> 02:11:46.765]  Collagen is not only the most fundamental structural protein in the body, it's the most fundamental protein in the body.
[02:11:47.305 --> 02:11:47.806]  We're good to go!
[02:12:10.103 --> 02:12:11.044]  Those blood vessels.
[02:12:11.084 --> 02:12:18.028]  Dr. Matthias Rath has written extensively about this in a really neat book called, Why Animals Don't Get Heart Attacks.
[02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:26.534]  And he talks about how animals make their own vitamin C and animals don't get heart attacks because they make their own vitamin C and their blood vessels are strong and whole.
[02:12:26.794 --> 02:12:36.861]  How much of, one has to wonder when you see the link between vitamin C and the strength of blood vessels, how much of heart disease is simply a vitamin C deficiency disease.
[02:12:37.302 --> 02:12:39.003]  Not only that, but vitamin C is
[02:12:39.443 --> 02:12:43.585]  Hold your horses there, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, or hold your rats, because the British manuals going back up to 300 years ago said...
[02:12:57.592 --> 02:13:02.776]  If you can't find fresh green vegetables or fruits, eat rats.
[02:13:03.216 --> 02:13:12.222]  They had discovered that whatever was in the fruit was in the intestines of ship rats and that they would then gobble the guts of rats raw.
[02:13:12.563 --> 02:13:15.084]  So again, what you just said, most mammals produce it.
[02:13:15.365 --> 02:13:17.046]  Why don't we produce our own vitamin C?
[02:13:17.688 --> 02:13:21.872]  He really knows why, but they think it has something to do with the fact that we were eating fruits and vegetables.
[02:13:21.932 --> 02:13:38.586]  It turns out that certain gorillas, certain forms of gorillas, human beings, and guinea pigs of all critters, are the only animals that don't make vitamin C. Squirrels make vitamin C, horses make vitamin C, goats make vitamin C, and what's really fascinating, Alex, is when an animal is under stress, it makes
[02:13:38.826 --> 02:14:03.122]  More vitamin C. Your body's key stress gland, key stress handling structure, the adrenal glands, are very high in vitamin C. And when we're under stress of any kind, whether that's emotional stress, psychological stress, and certainly physical stress, you need more vitamin C. And this gets us to the whole topic of recommended daily allowances, the RDAs, which I call the Ridiculous Deficiency Allowance.
[02:14:03.182 --> 02:14:05.904]  The RDA of vitamin C, the Ridiculous Deficiency
[02:14:06.184 --> 02:14:06.464]  All right.
[02:14:27.162 --> 02:14:33.726]  Is what gives rise to the recommended daily allowance that allows people to think, well, I'll just take this multiple vitamin with the RDAs and I'll be fine.
[02:14:33.987 --> 02:14:37.189]  Or I better not take more than the RDAs or I'll be in big trouble.
[02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:42.773]  Nothing speaks to this fallacy more than the idea that you only need 55 or 60 milligrams of vitamin C.
[02:14:43.613 --> 02:14:44.994]  So, your point's well taken.
[02:14:45.114 --> 02:14:47.636]  Animals are making their own vitamin C. We're not.
[02:14:47.996 --> 02:14:50.918]  That means you gotta be supplementing.
[02:14:50.938 --> 02:14:53.340]  It's going to be very difficult to get your vitamin C out of food.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.684]  In fact, Alice, it's very difficult to get all of the vitamins you need from food anyway.
[02:14:59.164 --> 02:15:00.245]  For example, with vitamin E.
[02:15:00.805 --> 02:15:04.908]  The recommended daily allowance of vitamin E is 14 international units.
[02:15:05.409 --> 02:15:16.878]  Every study that's ever been done on the protective benefits of vitamin E show that you need 400 international units of vitamin E, and even the most vitamin E-dense foods are only going to give you about 40 international units.
[02:15:16.898 --> 02:15:25.505]  So, with vitamin E, with vitamin C, with the B-complex, you're not going to be able to get what you need from food, even under the best of circumstances.
[02:15:26.026 --> 02:15:28.808]  This is why it's so, so important to supplement.
[02:15:29.188 --> 02:15:29.849]  If you're healthy,
[02:15:30.349 --> 02:15:35.713]  And if you're sick, it is unspeakably important to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement program.
[02:15:36.034 --> 02:15:39.856]  So, vitamin C for the connective tissue in the body.
[02:15:40.037 --> 02:15:44.800]  By the way, bones, a lot of people are under the impression that all you need to do is take calcium for your bones.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:54.908]  Well, as it turns out, your bones too are made of collagen, and vitamin C is way more important for the integrity of your bones via this collagen connection.
[02:15:55.428 --> 02:15:56.649]  Thank you for watching.
[02:16:10.453 --> 02:16:26.341]  Any kind of heart disease issues, not to mention osteoporosis and high blood pressure and joint issues and arthritis, you want to make sure that you're getting enough vitamin C. For people who are interested in skin health, vitamin C can be amazingly helpful for protecting your skin from the sun.
[02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:30.123]  In fact, as it turns out, using nutritional supplements
[02:16:30.683 --> 02:16:36.644]  Or what is way more important for protecting your skin from the sun than any toxic sunscreen you could ever put on.
[02:16:37.064 --> 02:16:40.765]  And vitamin C is the king of sun protection vitamins.
[02:16:41.085 --> 02:16:44.826]  For folks who are out there in the sun, get some vitamin C in your body.
[02:16:44.846 --> 02:16:48.567]  You can even use vitamin C topically as a cream and it's got wonderful benefits that way too.
[02:16:48.587 --> 02:16:52.027]  Oh no, I've been using this vitamin C facial cream my wife's got.
[02:16:52.067 --> 02:16:53.908]  It's awesome and I've really seen it.
[02:16:54.608 --> 02:16:55.749]  Make my skin a lot healthier.
[02:16:56.209 --> 02:17:05.277]  And obviously, Beyond Tangy Tangerine or Polymburst Plus, things like that available at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:17:05.697 --> 02:17:09.240]  That would obviously be some of the best sources of vitamin C. Heck yes!
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:13.143]  You're getting a thousand milligrams of vitamin C per two scoops of the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[02:17:13.163 --> 02:17:17.486]  You know, here's the thing about the BTT, which you mentioned, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Polymburst.
[02:17:17.546 --> 02:17:18.347]  They're liquid.
[02:17:18.867 --> 02:17:18.927]  Yes.
[02:17:48.867 --> 02:18:06.520]  Dosages from what I've read and studied from yourself and others to really have the full effect but you'd have to drink two or three containers of orange juice to get the same vitamin C and a beyond tangy tangerine scoop and then you'd be getting all of that bad overload of fructose that attacks the liver and everything else.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.820]  Not to mention the pesticides as well.
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:16.122]  So, now, orange juice has got a very small amount of vitamin C. You get about 30 or 40 milligrams of vitamin C in a glass of orange juice.
[02:18:16.142 --> 02:18:19.502]  And then, of course, you're exposing yourself to all that sugar and all those pesticides.
[02:18:19.542 --> 02:18:23.743]  One of the neat things about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine is the liquid format.
[02:18:24.183 --> 02:18:33.084]  And so if you're dealing with digestive distress, but you understand you want to get on a nutritional supplement program, you understand how important it is, please take a shot at liquid nutrition.
[02:18:33.385 --> 02:18:36.145]  Please take a shot at products like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine that will
[02:18:36.325 --> 02:18:36.925]  Well, exactly.
[02:18:36.965 --> 02:18:44.288]  But expanding on that, expanding on that, it's got all the other vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors together to supercharge it.
[02:18:44.508 --> 02:18:46.569]  And I want to talk about how things work together when we come back.
[02:18:46.609 --> 02:18:52.692]  But separately, folks, green leafy vegetables, berries, there's a lot of great ways to get vitamin C as well.
[02:18:53.252 --> 02:19:02.080]  It's just the products at Infowarsteam.com, they're discounted, or what I'm using and what Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds with, even though it's not advertised as a weight loss product.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:06.023]  The food is so devoid of nutrients now because of the played out soils.
[02:19:06.303 --> 02:19:14.431]  You're eating and eating and eating empty calories, trying to simply get the vitamins and minerals you need, and so that's why when you finally get
[02:19:15.231 --> 02:19:16.553]  The vitamins and minerals you need.
[02:19:16.593 --> 02:19:19.055]  You don't have those cravings as bad anymore and you can lose the weight.
[02:19:19.316 --> 02:19:21.258]  But see, we've only covered one vitamin.
[02:19:21.738 --> 02:19:25.062]  Vitamin C, the King Daddy that I started with, that you started with.
[02:19:25.082 --> 02:19:26.003]  We didn't plan to do that.
[02:19:26.043 --> 02:19:27.565]  That was just, we're on the same page.
[02:19:27.605 --> 02:19:31.990]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, one of the top compounding pharmacists out there in the country.
[02:19:32.410 --> 02:19:33.431]  Syndicated talk show host.
[02:19:33.451 --> 02:19:35.253]  When we come back, let's race!
[02:19:35.854 --> 02:19:41.639]  Through the other vitamins, then the minerals, then trace elements and key co-factors, because I want to know this.
[02:19:41.659 --> 02:19:45.402]  I was listening to your show a few days ago and just riveted and I said, get me Ben Fuchs.
[02:19:45.882 --> 02:19:46.823]  And we talked off air.
[02:19:46.883 --> 02:19:48.724]  We got this whole file together.
[02:19:48.764 --> 02:19:51.326]  We just spent 20 minutes on one vitamin.
[02:19:51.767 --> 02:19:58.972]  Get your notepads ready, because we're going to run down the line here with info Big Brother doesn't want you to know.
[02:20:00.086 --> 02:20:06.068]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:20:06.228 --> 02:20:08.988]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:09.188 --> 02:20:13.269]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted.
[02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:19.231]  The business blowing up your food prices.
[02:20:21.738 --> 02:20:26.903]  Raise your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:20:27.163 --> 02:20:30.847]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:31.027 --> 02:20:32.589]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:32.809 --> 02:20:36.673]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:36.833 --> 02:20:39.436]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:47.580]  Don't wait!

[02:21:00.046 --> 02:21:01.847]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:21:02.067 --> 02:21:04.609]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:08.671]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[02:21:09.152 --> 02:21:14.315]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[02:21:14.995 --> 02:21:17.336]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:21:17.957 --> 02:21:24.581]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[02:21:25.041 --> 02:21:30.804]  The officer told me to go to EZArmor.com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[02:21:31.365 --> 02:21:37.048]  EZArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[02:21:37.628 --> 02:21:42.992]  I was surprised at how little EZArmor costs and I installed EZArmor in about 30 minutes.

[02:21:59.301 --> 02:22:02.144]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[02:22:02.464 --> 02:22:06.708]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[02:22:06.928 --> 02:22:08.089]  Here's the really bad news.
[02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:14.875]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[02:22:15.176 --> 02:22:23.884]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[02:22:24.344 --> 02:22:26.045]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[02:24:10.277 --> 02:24:21.944]  So, when old folks go in with Alzheimer's and big rotholes in their arms where their skin is falling apart and their teeth have all fallen out, the doctors don't say, hey, you have scurvy.
[02:24:24.325 --> 02:24:27.487]  They just send them home to rot and die.
[02:24:28.548 --> 02:24:32.410]  Because Big Pharma doesn't make money if they say, hey, go eat some blueberries.
[02:24:34.352 --> 02:24:38.894]  Or go take naturally derived, say, Rose Hemp Vitamin C or something.
[02:24:39.294 --> 02:24:40.214]  Don't, you know, it doesn't matter.
[02:24:40.254 --> 02:24:47.036]  Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes, one of them for discovering how powerful, I mean, the Vitamin C is magic.
[02:24:47.456 --> 02:24:50.117]  This is a short six-minute segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:50.497 --> 02:24:51.818]  Okay, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:24:52.677 --> 02:24:55.961]  We're going to post this video, this interview at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:24:56.001 --> 02:25:03.511]  If anybody's listening on the radio and wants to see the video of it and some of the documents we're going to be going over, it'll be posted by tomorrow at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:25:05.013 --> 02:25:09.720]  Continue, let's race through the other vitamins right now and what they're directly linked to if you don't have them.
[02:25:10.678 --> 02:25:22.740]  Vitamin E, brain health, dry skin, these are deficiencies in vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiencies are associated with problems with thinking, with brain problems, with dementias, with macular degeneration, with eye disease, with impotence, with infertility.
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.401]  By the way, there's an infertility epidemic in this country.
[02:25:25.461 --> 02:25:27.961]  Vitamin E is known as the fertility vitamin.
[02:25:28.262 --> 02:25:31.922]  The technical name for vitamin E is tocopherol, which means to bear children.
[02:25:32.322 --> 02:25:35.003]  Deficiencies in vitamin E are associated with prostate disease.
[02:25:35.863 --> 02:25:36.444]  Epidemic.
[02:25:36.524 --> 02:25:42.447]  Deficiencies in vitamin E can cause skin problems like hyperpigmentation, dark spots, another seeming epidemic.
[02:25:42.487 --> 02:25:46.309]  Then there's the B-complex, which is a series of vitamins that are found in nature.
[02:25:46.349 --> 02:25:48.250]  The B-complex are the energy vitamins.
[02:25:48.310 --> 02:25:54.834]  If you're feeling sluggish, if you're feeling lethargic, if you have brain fog, all of these are associated with B-complex deficiencies.
[02:25:54.874 --> 02:25:59.897]  The more sugar you eat, the more deficient you're going to be in key B-vitamins.
[02:25:59.917 --> 02:26:03.719]  There's a B-vitamin that is so fundamental for brain health that Dr. Abram Hoffer
[02:26:04.119 --> 02:26:10.445]  I wrote a book called Orthomolecular Psychiatry talking about treating schizophrenia successfully.
[02:26:11.166 --> 02:26:11.566]  That's B12!
[02:26:11.626 --> 02:26:14.048]  That's B3.
[02:26:14.088 --> 02:26:15.770]  B12 is unspeakably important.
[02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:18.933]  If you have any digestive issues, you're going to be deficient in B12.
[02:26:18.973 --> 02:26:26.180]  B12 is critical for the nervous system and for the blood system and many people are deficient in B12 and don't notice it.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.922]  If you have any gastritis or
[02:26:28.522 --> 02:26:30.944]  Low stomach acid issues, you're going to have problems absorbing B12.
[02:26:31.044 --> 02:26:39.052]  Vitamin B3, by the way, is wonderful for treating social anxiety disorder or jitteriness, or just generalized anxiety deficiencies.
[02:26:39.512 --> 02:26:44.857]  And vitamin B3 are associated with brain fog, learning disabilities, cholesterol.
[02:26:44.898 --> 02:26:46.059]  It's a more powerful...
[02:26:46.759 --> 02:26:47.060]  I think?
[02:27:04.458 --> 02:27:12.105]  It's associated, deficiencies are associated with diabetes, with poor sugar control, with high blood pressure, with multiple sclerosis, with cardiovascular disease.
[02:27:12.125 --> 02:27:18.731]  This is like a who's who of all the diseases that we're dealing with and they're all associated with nutritional deficiencies.
[02:27:19.232 --> 02:27:21.474]  Vitamin K deficiencies associated with bruising.
[02:27:21.494 --> 02:27:23.235]  And by the way, you're not just saying this.
[02:27:25.097 --> 02:27:25.698]  Right now.
[02:27:26.138 --> 02:27:35.589]  This is admitted, and the people they put on Coumadin, they tell them not to eat green vegetables, which has the vitamin K, and then the rotholes are all in their skin, their skin's falling off.
[02:27:35.889 --> 02:27:37.251]  They're literally being murdered.
[02:27:37.531 --> 02:27:38.552]  This is not your opinion.
[02:27:38.592 --> 02:27:40.014]  They've known this for hundreds of years.
[02:27:40.074 --> 02:27:40.575]  Please continue.
[02:27:41.994 --> 02:27:43.575]  It's absolutely correct, by the way.
[02:27:43.635 --> 02:27:50.878]  When they put you on Coumadin, they tell you not to eat any vitamin K-containing foods, including broccoli and cauliflower and anything that's got vitamin K in it.
[02:27:51.178 --> 02:27:52.318]  Same with vitamin E, by the way.
[02:27:52.398 --> 02:28:01.522]  After surgery, and even before surgery, vitamin E is such an effective blood thinner that they'll tell you not to take vitamin E. Why don't they give you vitamin E instead of the Coumadin?
[02:28:01.562 --> 02:28:05.223]  That's a whole other... Instead of the medications, that's a whole other question.
[02:28:05.783 --> 02:28:09.745]  Anyway, vitamin A deficiency is associated with acne.
[02:28:09.805 --> 02:28:11.866]  I deal with acne all the time.
[02:28:11.906 --> 02:28:18.829]  And if you want to induce acne in a patient or in a laboratory animal, you've got to do nothing more than remove the vitamin A out of the diet.
[02:28:19.149 --> 02:28:23.651]  Vitamin A deficiencies are associated with zinc deficiencies, which is extremely common.
[02:28:24.191 --> 02:28:24.572]  I think?
[02:28:40.894 --> 02:28:46.137]  Acne, eczema, poor wound repair, zinc is absolutely vital for growing protein for children.
[02:28:46.157 --> 02:28:57.703]  I know multiple women who are pretty young who have the epidemic of their hair falling out because they're on diets, all this stuff, that their hair came back when they were on Beyond Tangy Tangerine for six months.
[02:28:58.063 --> 02:29:00.384]  I mean, the hair came back.
[02:29:00.784 --> 02:29:01.745]  I watched it.
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:04.861]  That's not surprising to me.
[02:29:04.901 --> 02:29:10.045]  You're getting a healthy dose of nutrients and you're getting them in liquid format, easy-to-absorb fashion.
[02:29:10.285 --> 02:29:15.970]  That's the neat thing, by the way, about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and liquid nutrition is you notice results quickly.
[02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:17.992]  This isn't like a 30-day kind of thing.
[02:29:18.572 --> 02:29:22.936]  You notice results in days, sometimes in doses, sometimes in one or two doses.
[02:29:22.976 --> 02:29:25.798]  And the great thing about the human body in deficiency states
[02:29:26.258 --> 02:29:30.961]  Is the more deficient you are, the faster your body responds.
[02:29:31.321 --> 02:29:34.683]  The more weight you need to lose, the faster you'll lose the weight.
[02:29:34.984 --> 02:29:39.286]  The more nutritionally deficient you are, the faster your body will absorb the nutrients.
[02:29:39.326 --> 02:29:43.509]  That means the... Oh yeah, people that are really skinny gain weight on it.
[02:29:44.229 --> 02:29:45.931]  Your body knows what to do with these tools.
[02:29:46.171 --> 02:29:48.892]  We'll be back with the rest of Vitamins, Minerals, Trace Elements.
[02:29:49.293 --> 02:29:50.193]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.714 --> 02:29:52.215]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.216 --> 02:29:55.902]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.872 --> 02:30:05.513]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:05.833 --> 02:30:13.954]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:14.694 --> 02:30:18.735]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:19.335 --> 02:30:30.137]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:30.777 --> 02:30:39.779]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:40.299 --> 02:30:45.340]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:45.721 --> 02:30:52.902]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:53.202 --> 02:30:55.963]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:30:59.739 --> 02:31:04.980]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:31:05.241 --> 02:31:07.441]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:31:07.661 --> 02:31:16.584]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:16.744 --> 02:31:19.924]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:31:20.205 --> 02:31:21.625]  There's no priming required.
[02:31:21.865 --> 02:31:23.906]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:31:24.146 --> 02:31:25.606]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[02:31:25.606 --> 02:31:26.386]  We're good to go.
[02:31:54.815 --> 02:31:57.778]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:31:58.438 --> 02:32:00.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:06.225]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:06.465 --> 02:32:11.109]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:11.489 --> 02:32:16.514]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:17.054 --> 02:32:21.757]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:22.278 --> 02:32:24.199]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:32:24.579 --> 02:32:29.202]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:29.382 --> 02:32:30.283]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:30.503 --> 02:32:33.285]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:33.565 --> 02:32:36.887]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:37.208 --> 02:32:40.049]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:42.291]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:42.611 --> 02:32:43.532]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:47.174 --> 02:32:48.936]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:51.398 --> 02:32:55.922]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:56.243 --> 02:32:58.625]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:17.896 --> 02:33:20.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:23.924]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:24.545 --> 02:33:27.029]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:33:27.109 --> 02:33:27.750]  Eastern.
[02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:30.894]  Back on the radio Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:31.395 --> 02:33:32.796]  And don't forget weeknights.
[02:33:34.002 --> 02:33:48.427]  Five nights a week, seven o'clock central, eight o'clock eastern, InfoWars Nightly News, where you'll find me, Alex Jones, and my incredible crew of out-of-control, rampaging liberty lovers.
[02:33:48.987 --> 02:33:50.508]  We will not stand down.
[02:33:50.888 --> 02:33:52.468]  We will not back down.
[02:33:52.928 --> 02:33:54.729]  We will not surrender.
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:00.382]  Hear the cry of war!
[02:34:02.523 --> 02:34:04.144]  Louder than before!
[02:34:05.605 --> 02:34:08.708]  With the sword of truth, we control the land!
[02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:22.518]  Yeah, we're gonna drag the Phantom Lord of the New World Order out by a shirt tail and with God's help, throw him right into the pit when the Archangel ties him up in chains.
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:26.520]  Listen to this part right here.
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:31.902]  Some poetry right there.
[02:34:31.922 --> 02:34:33.703]  All right, let's go back to Ben Phoenix.
[02:34:33.723 --> 02:34:35.524]  It's hard to turn that off.
[02:34:39.085 --> 02:34:40.065]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[02:34:40.205 --> 02:34:43.907]  I promote what I believe in, and I'm going to do a plug right here for the Longevity products.
[02:34:44.267 --> 02:34:44.807]  Discounted.
[02:34:44.847 --> 02:34:50.649]  If you sign up for $10, like Costco, you get discounts at Infowarsteam.com, and your purchase supports us.
[02:34:51.430 --> 02:34:54.571]  They've got the Just Out with my ugly face on the cover.
[02:34:56.016 --> 02:35:05.903]  Polymer's Plus with the current berries from New Zealand, little added boost of antioxidants on top of all the bees and the minerals and the bee pollen and all the stuff that's in there.
[02:35:06.704 --> 02:35:08.305]  The Beyond Tangy Tangerine, everything.
[02:35:08.685 --> 02:35:10.407]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:35:10.427 --> 02:35:11.527]  877-551-1301.
[02:35:11.547 --> 02:35:11.868]  877-551-1301.
[02:35:12.028 --> 02:35:24.477]  If you want to call and be a distributor or got any questions or want to talk to some of the folks at the Infowars team, a lot of people that end up being distributors end up working for the crew here.
[02:35:25.217 --> 02:35:27.839]  This stuff has taken the country by storm through our radio show.
[02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:33.944]  I know that it's boosted the overall longevity sales period outside of what I'm doing, about 35% in the last year.
[02:35:33.964 --> 02:35:36.626]  Because people buy what really works.
[02:35:37.406 --> 02:35:37.747]  Okay?
[02:35:38.067 --> 02:35:42.350]  Again, I've been promoting this two years, knew it was good, didn't really... It stuck my toe in, though.
[02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:49.896]  It was just another sponsorship of something I believed in, but I wasn't... What I saw with Aaron, and then my family, and my mother, who's a triathlete, and everybody else, and then...
[02:35:50.436 --> 02:35:53.278]  Women I know whose hair was falling out and the hair came back in.
[02:35:54.479 --> 02:35:56.901]  I mean, because it wasn't a hormonal issue, it was a nutrient thing.
[02:35:57.222 --> 02:35:58.463]  Nails growing faster.
[02:35:58.483 --> 02:36:05.488]  I don't want to get into personal stuff, but I never had a really oily skin, but I get some, you know, blackheads and stuff.
[02:36:05.548 --> 02:36:06.909]  Just almost gone.
[02:36:06.930 --> 02:36:09.872]  I mean, really dramatic effects.
[02:36:10.132 --> 02:36:13.315]  Only problem is I feel like I'm 18 again and I'm being super aggressive.
[02:36:14.144 --> 02:36:17.445]  I mean, super aggressive, where I'm just ready to get in fights almost instantly.
[02:36:18.525 --> 02:36:20.466]  But that's... most people doesn't do that, okay?
[02:36:20.506 --> 02:36:21.966]  That's just how I am, okay?
[02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:23.307]  I've always been aggressive.
[02:36:24.067 --> 02:36:29.108]  And going back to Ben Fuchs, I know a lot of these, having this mix also has boosted my testosterone.
[02:36:29.288 --> 02:36:32.249]  Naturally, I'm not going to get into how I know that's happened.
[02:36:33.169 --> 02:36:36.790]  But men know when you've got a boosted testosterone, how you know that.
[02:36:37.391 --> 02:36:38.471]  The point is, this is real.
[02:36:38.951 --> 02:36:40.552]  Now, can you do this through other products?
[02:36:40.572 --> 02:36:41.533]  Yeah, it'll cost you more.
[02:36:42.093 --> 02:36:42.974]  We've even looked at it.
[02:36:43.014 --> 02:36:47.357]  It costs a lot more to try to get everything you get in just a few Longevity products.
[02:36:47.377 --> 02:36:54.081]  The Alex Pack with the Osteo FX, the Essential Fatty Acids, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, and the Polymers Plus.
[02:36:54.121 --> 02:36:55.222]  You do that, you get everything.
[02:36:55.822 --> 02:36:59.265]  They've got a lot of other little specialty cofactors and things, and I'm gonna stop plugging now.
[02:36:59.565 --> 02:37:00.867]  That's not why Ben Fuchs is on.
[02:37:00.887 --> 02:37:02.048]  We could do two hours on this.
[02:37:02.728 --> 02:37:11.757]  You can get clean water, you can get the basic vitamins, basic minerals, huge dosages of vitamin C, and just see what it does for you.
[02:37:11.957 --> 02:37:12.978]  Try some other company.
[02:37:13.458 --> 02:37:14.419]  Just, just please.
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:18.243]  In fact, Ben, before we get back to the minerals and vitamins, we've covered about 10% of them.
[02:37:18.283 --> 02:37:19.083]  We've got a race now.
[02:37:19.924 --> 02:37:21.946]  Because I've heard you talk about this specifically.
[02:37:23.007 --> 02:37:27.430]  I've found that if I drink more clean water as well, that that's essential.
[02:37:27.791 --> 02:37:31.054]  And I've seen that help family before I even woke up to this other stuff.
[02:37:31.934 --> 02:37:36.738]  You know, I had like great uncles and people who I'd sit there and watch drinking coffee and tea all day.
[02:37:36.758 --> 02:37:38.240]  And I said, do you drink water?
[02:37:39.162 --> 02:37:40.162]  And they can hardly get out of their chair.
[02:37:40.202 --> 02:37:40.543]  They're like, no.
[02:37:40.843 --> 02:37:41.963]  And I go, you're all shriveled up.
[02:37:41.983 --> 02:37:42.723]  You're dehydrated.
[02:37:43.104 --> 02:37:44.284]  Do you know that's a diuretic?
[02:37:44.364 --> 02:37:46.345]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:37:46.925 --> 02:37:51.627]  I'm like, hey, listen, you know, I brought him literature said if you want to feel better, do this.
[02:37:52.107 --> 02:37:54.008]  And it was like a new person just off water.
[02:37:54.048 --> 02:37:55.689]  So we're not selling water, by the way.
[02:37:55.729 --> 02:37:56.869]  We think you should purify it.
[02:37:57.289 --> 02:37:59.610]  I mean, but there's a lot of stuff hidden in plain view.
[02:37:59.890 --> 02:38:01.031]  The system knows this.
[02:38:01.311 --> 02:38:03.612]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, how important is water?
[02:38:04.662 --> 02:38:05.022]  Please.
[02:38:05.623 --> 02:38:07.285]  More water means more blood.
[02:38:07.725 --> 02:38:13.370]  More blood means more oxygen and more nutrition and you don't need to know anything more than that.
[02:38:13.410 --> 02:38:15.192]  Especially, by the way, first thing in the morning.
[02:38:15.532 --> 02:38:22.299]  First thing in the morning we tend to be dehydrated because usually we've gone to the bathroom once or twice and we haven't replaced our fluids for six or eight hours.
[02:38:22.319 --> 02:38:24.561]  So first thing in the morning you're dehydrated.
[02:38:24.981 --> 02:38:30.825]  When you drink more water, immediately, within moments, you have more blood volume.
[02:38:30.885 --> 02:38:33.466]  More blood volume means more nutrients and more oxygen.
[02:38:33.506 --> 02:38:38.069]  And by the way, for diabetics, drinking more water is absolutely vital.
[02:38:38.089 --> 02:38:41.551]  And we know 30% of Americans are either pre-diabetic or diabetic.
[02:38:41.791 --> 02:38:45.473]  Drinking more water will dilute your blood... your blood sugar too.
[02:38:46.014 --> 02:38:47.695]  So if you're having... So it's the garbage man!
[02:38:47.755 --> 02:38:49.356]  It helps carry away all the trash.
[02:38:50.501 --> 02:38:56.424]  It makes your blood volume higher and it delivers more nutrients to your tissues.
[02:38:56.464 --> 02:39:07.069]  When you have high blood pressure, by the way, and almost 80 to 100 million Americans are dealing with high blood pressure issues, that's a sign that your body is trying to deliver more nutrients and more oxygen to the tissues.
[02:39:07.569 --> 02:39:16.175]  Simply drinking more water, by virtue of the fact that it will deliver more nutrients to your body's cells, will allow your blood pressure to relax.
[02:39:16.596 --> 02:39:21.419]  So drinking more water is important for brain health, it's important for nutrient delivery, it's important for detoxification.
[02:39:21.439 --> 02:39:27.923]  But that doesn't make big pharma, who happen to be eugenicists, more money, so they don't ever tell you about that at the doctor's office.
[02:39:28.224 --> 02:39:31.706]  Let's continue with the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors.
[02:39:31.806 --> 02:39:32.447]  Race through them.
[02:39:33.493 --> 02:39:35.314]  EFAs, essential fatty acids.
[02:39:35.374 --> 02:39:39.456]  I don't know if you could come up with one supplement that's more important than essential fatty acids.
[02:39:39.476 --> 02:39:42.717]  They are a must-have nutritional supplement.
[02:39:43.238 --> 02:39:46.099]  They're very difficult to get out of foods because of processing.
[02:39:46.399 --> 02:39:49.921]  Deficiencies in EFAs will wreak havoc on your hormone system.
[02:39:50.281 --> 02:39:51.962]  It'll wreak havoc on your skin.
[02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:54.083]  You cannot make collagen for your skin.
[02:39:54.143 --> 02:39:57.464]  Like with vitamin C, you can't make collagen without essential fatty acids.
[02:39:57.744 --> 02:39:58.845]  You can't make the skin's
[02:39:59.025 --> 02:39:59.786]  We're good to go!
[02:40:22.481 --> 02:40:31.812]  That's one of the neat things about nutritional supplementation is it will allow you to wean yourself off of foods that you know are bad for you, but that you cannot resist.
[02:40:32.213 --> 02:40:40.543]  Food manufacturers and chemical companies understand that under conditions of nutritional deficiencies, we won't be able to stop eating the french fries.
[02:40:40.663 --> 02:40:41.503]  Well, yeah, that's Aaron.
[02:40:41.523 --> 02:40:43.484]  Aaron lost 92 pounds over a year.
[02:40:43.524 --> 02:40:47.806]  He's now six months into keeping it off, but now his muscles are building up.
[02:40:48.586 --> 02:40:51.647]  And, I mean, he literally has had a total transformation.
[02:40:51.667 --> 02:40:54.709]  The video of that is now posted at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:40:54.729 --> 02:41:00.071]  We aired it on the radio yesterday, but for people that want to see the before and after, it's at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:41:00.831 --> 02:41:02.132]  Just posted there last night.
[02:41:03.749 --> 02:41:05.231]  You and I didn't even talk about weight loss.
[02:41:05.351 --> 02:41:10.156]  Well, the point is, he said whenever he was craving pizza or whatever, he just would take essential fatty acids.
[02:41:10.837 --> 02:41:11.177]  Go ahead.
[02:41:11.538 --> 02:41:13.079]  That's exactly right.
[02:41:13.119 --> 02:41:16.703]  When you're craving fats, that's your body's cry for good fats.
[02:41:16.723 --> 02:41:24.732]  Your body doesn't have a cry for french fry fats, but it has a loud cry for essential fatty acids and we just don't listen or understand or interpret
[02:41:25.453 --> 02:41:26.294]  No, I started doing that!
[02:41:49.614 --> 02:41:53.057]  I've started doing that because I sleep pretty good, but the dogs bark, the kids wake up.
[02:41:53.457 --> 02:42:03.826]  If I take a teaspoon of this magnesium stuff that I've gotten from Yongevity, it literally, I sleep like the dead, where you just wake up in the morning, boom, you know, that deep sleep.
[02:42:04.226 --> 02:42:05.527]  It is, it's a drug.
[02:42:05.748 --> 02:42:06.588]  That's what they don't tell you.
[02:42:06.608 --> 02:42:13.915]  The vitamins and minerals are the real drugs that are natural, that our body's designed to get, and the pimps don't want us knowing that.
[02:42:14.195 --> 02:42:16.317]  They sell us manipulated garbage.
[02:42:17.298 --> 02:42:18.479]  Well, that's a brilliant point.
[02:42:18.559 --> 02:42:21.020]  Nutrients are what drugs dream they could be.
[02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:28.704]  When a drug goes to bed at night and has a fantasy, it fantasizes that it's a nutrient, because nutrients give you benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:28.724 --> 02:42:33.946]  This is a medicinal dream come true, to have benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:33.986 --> 02:42:43.711]  If a pharmaceutical company could find a drug that was as powerful as vitamin C, that had all the benefits of vitamin C or any vitamin or mineral, but had no side effects, what would that drug be worth?
[02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:52.973]  What would a drug be worth that could lower your blood pressure, that could fight cancer, that could boost your immune system, that could build bone, among many other things, and have zero toxicity?
[02:42:52.993 --> 02:42:54.133]  Can you name a drug like that?
[02:42:54.153 --> 02:42:56.694]  There's no drug on planet Earth that can do anything like that.
[02:42:56.714 --> 02:43:05.376]  Well, what they're doing is they're coming and adding a molecule, or something to the molecule, and they are starting to patent fish oils and things, and they're making you pay ten times more.
[02:43:06.431 --> 02:43:06.971]  That's right.
[02:43:07.011 --> 02:43:09.272]  You see, a cell depends on nutrients.
[02:43:09.372 --> 02:43:11.813]  Nutrients are a cell's support system.
[02:43:11.893 --> 02:43:13.413]  Nutrients are like the cavalry.
[02:43:13.653 --> 02:43:15.093]  They carry the forces of life.
[02:43:15.194 --> 02:43:16.514]  Drugs are like Darth Vader.
[02:43:16.994 --> 02:43:21.955]  Drugs force a cell to do their bidding, all supposedly in the interest of a greater good.
[02:43:22.356 --> 02:43:25.676]  Drugs are like communist dictators, like Mao.
[02:43:25.997 --> 02:43:30.258]  Supposedly in the interest of the greater good of the body, they poison the individual cells.
[02:43:31.318 --> 02:43:31.698]  I think so.
[02:43:54.834 --> 02:44:06.041]  And this whole idea of medications and drugs and prescriptions being handled by the poison control system in the body, which is impeccable, this whole idea of drugs being handled this way has two important implications.
[02:44:06.081 --> 02:44:09.984]  Number one, it depletes your bodies of nutrients.
[02:44:10.304 --> 02:44:15.187]  The more prescription drugs you're taking, the more nutritional deficiencies you will have.
[02:44:15.607 --> 02:44:17.669]  Nutrients that are typically not replaced.
[02:44:18.129 --> 02:44:24.813]  And also, secondly, focusing on drugs makes it more likely that not all other things will get cleared out.
[02:44:24.853 --> 02:44:36.181]  If your poison control system is overwhelmed from detoxifying your statin drugs, or from detoxifying your antibiotics, or detoxifying whatever medications you're on... Your immune system turns off and you get cancer!
[02:44:37.153 --> 02:44:41.496]  You'll be depleting your body's ability to handle these cancer-causing substances.
[02:44:41.516 --> 02:44:45.698]  You're going to be depleting your impeccable poison control system's energy.
[02:44:45.718 --> 02:44:52.162]  You'll be increasing the risks of poisons being built up, and even worse, you're going to be building up toxic intermediaries.
[02:44:52.202 --> 02:44:55.324]  And this is a point that's missed when we hear about drugs.
[02:44:55.684 --> 02:44:57.345]  We hear about side effects, and they're hideous.
[02:44:57.765 --> 02:45:01.907]  But even worse, you're depleting your body's ability to handle poisons.
[02:45:02.167 --> 02:45:05.768]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle cancer-causing substances.
[02:45:06.108 --> 02:45:10.269]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle substances that cause disease.
[02:45:10.289 --> 02:45:13.050]  And you may not even make the connection between the two.
[02:45:13.471 --> 02:45:17.972]  There's not a single drug on planet Earth that can heal anything in the body.
[02:45:17.992 --> 02:45:22.274]  They are simply there to change test markers and to eliminate symptoms.
[02:45:22.314 --> 02:45:22.894]  On the other hand,
[02:45:23.334 --> 02:45:28.195]  By using nutritional supplements, you can literally reverse the disease process.
[02:45:28.275 --> 02:45:30.316]  That's the beauty of good nutrition.
[02:45:30.336 --> 02:45:32.196]  And that's why I'm a nutritional pharmacist, Alex.
[02:45:32.556 --> 02:45:38.057]  That's why I practice nutrition instead of dispensing toxic pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:45:38.337 --> 02:45:42.578]  Because nutrients are the quintessential premier medicines.
[02:45:42.618 --> 02:45:46.659]  They are the very definition of what a medicine should be, with no toxicity.
[02:45:48.089 --> 02:46:09.499]  All right, continuing here, let's get into, we've gotten into magnesium, we've gotten into fatty acids, let's get into selenium, then let's get into other minerals, cofactors, and some of the things from your research and other major studies, some of the other things that have been found that really supercharge things and help your body use all of these things in concert.
[02:46:10.539 --> 02:46:10.880]  I think?
[02:46:29.962 --> 02:46:32.764]  And it runs on a little selenium battery.
[02:46:33.004 --> 02:46:38.927]  One of the neat things about minerals is they function electromagnetically as batteries that charge enzymes.
[02:46:38.987 --> 02:46:42.508]  And one of the most important enzymes that selenium charges is glutathione.
[02:46:42.528 --> 02:46:46.070]  Without selenium, you can't make this master cancer fighter.
[02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:49.332]  Selenium is also an important component in thyroid health.
[02:46:49.452 --> 02:46:53.254]  If you're hypothyroid, you definitely want to think about getting on selenium.
[02:46:53.594 --> 02:46:56.415]  Selenium deficiency is associated with muscle weakness.
[02:46:56.475 --> 02:46:57.676]  It's associated with fatigue.
[02:46:57.696 --> 02:46:59.157]  It's associated with joint disease.
[02:46:59.797 --> 02:47:00.138]  I think so.
[02:47:23.977 --> 02:47:29.661]  Alright, let's talk about this, and then I want to go into some of the current news items that you wanted to mention.
[02:47:29.681 --> 02:47:32.663]  And there's other key co-factors and things like what you were just mentioning, but why are they attacking
[02:47:53.801 --> 02:47:55.903]  Eggs and even whey protein.
[02:47:55.943 --> 02:47:57.043]  I guess they don't want us healthy.
[02:47:57.624 --> 02:48:05.489]  LA Times says eating whole eggs is dangerous as smoking, but then our brain is mainly made out of these good cholesterols.
[02:48:05.549 --> 02:48:08.511]  Is it true that we should be on a low-fat diet?
[02:48:09.275 --> 02:48:21.713]  Well, even Ancel Keys, who was the father of the so-called fat and cholesterol hypothesis, has come out saying that we've known all along that dietary cholesterol has nothing to do with the amount of cholesterol in your body.
[02:48:21.733 --> 02:48:24.417]  This whole thing on eggs, I'm going to talk about this on my program tomorrow.
[02:48:24.677 --> 02:48:27.258]  This whole thing on eggs is absolutely tragic.
[02:48:27.298 --> 02:48:33.780]  If anybody listens to this silliness that's coming out of this study in Canada, it's very, very unfortunate.
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:51.825]  First of all, if you look at the numbers, and you've got to be very careful with how the press reports things, if you look at the numbers right out of the study, as it turns out, people who ate the highest amount of eggs had exactly the same cholesterol, even higher cholesterol levels than people who ate less eggs.
[02:48:52.285 --> 02:48:57.390]  So, this whole idea of eating egg yolks and causing cancer, this is just a bunch of hooey.
[02:48:57.690 --> 02:49:02.554]  The egg yolk is nature's richest source of nutrients next to human mother's milk.
[02:49:03.155 --> 02:49:07.219]  And not in the white, the nutrients are not in the white when it comes to an egg, they're in the yolk.
[02:49:07.239 --> 02:49:18.729]  And I'm talking vitamin A, I'm talking the B-complex, I'm talking vitamin K, I'm talking essential fatty acids, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, copper, iron, manganese, selenium, zinc, these are all in the yolk.
[02:49:18.729 --> 02:49:23.152]  You can tell people that have epilepsy eat more eggs because it's been associated with helping the brain.
[02:49:23.172 --> 02:49:24.693]  I mean, this is known.
[02:49:25.073 --> 02:49:30.817]  So why are they... I mean, if they're going to put taxes on cigarettes, I guess now they're saying eggs are bad.
[02:49:31.117 --> 02:49:32.658]  Bloomberg wants to tax salt.
[02:49:33.179 --> 02:49:37.702]  He wants to tax soft drinks.
[02:49:37.982 --> 02:49:41.624]  Again, making themselves the good guys while ignoring all the real problems.
[02:49:41.664 --> 02:49:47.368]  Are they doing that, knowing they're killing us with an anti-state so that they can selectively take control?
[02:49:49.570 --> 02:49:51.811]  You know, that's a point that's well taken, but you know what?
[02:49:51.851 --> 02:49:53.172]  We've got to take the control back.
[02:49:53.592 --> 02:50:00.497]  This idea of nutritional supplementation is one of the best ways that you can take charge of your health and not depend on the doctor.
[02:50:00.537 --> 02:50:11.504]  And Alex, what's going to happen if we end up with this Obamacare thing, with managed care, government-mandated managed care, government-mandated HMOs, this is going to be an
[02:50:11.784 --> 02:50:16.785]  Unmitigated health disaster and our best protection is to understand how to use nutritional supplementation.
[02:50:16.826 --> 02:50:35.151]  And by the way, as far as this study goes on, egg yolks, look to see who the scientists who came up with this study, Dr. David Spence, the Canadian authors, David Spence and David Jenkins and Gene Davignon, see who these guys get paid for, and guess who you will find is writing the checks?
[02:50:35.891 --> 02:50:58.942]  AstraZeneca and the cholesterol, the drug companies... Sure, they want to say it's the cholesterol that's bad, not imbalances in the body, and at the same time, they want to put statins in the water, even of children, so they're creating this world where the building blocks of our body are listed as evil, so they can tax them and regulate them and control them, not letting us have access to it.
[02:51:00.154 --> 02:51:06.140]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:51:06.681 --> 02:51:09.063]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:51:09.263 --> 02:51:14.369]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:51:14.669 --> 02:51:19.354]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:51:19.614 --> 02:51:26.998]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:51:27.258 --> 02:51:30.960]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:32.701]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:51:32.921 --> 02:51:36.783]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:51:36.943 --> 02:51:39.564]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:51:39.824 --> 02:51:42.465]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:51:42.625 --> 02:51:47.046]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rise in food cost.
[02:51:47.186 --> 02:51:47.706]  Don't wait!
[02:51:47.826 --> 02:51:49.687]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:51:51.287 --> 02:51:52.828]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:52:00.242 --> 02:52:03.044]  My name is Leslie, and I've had depression since I was a child.
[02:52:03.245 --> 02:52:10.070]  After being on Prozac for 20 years, I got onto the One World Way, and my need for Prozac was reduced by 50% within a few months.
[02:52:10.591 --> 02:52:13.433]  Now, after less than one year, I am completely off of Prozac.
[02:52:13.893 --> 02:52:17.316]  I learned that mercury is a toxin that causes brain damage and depression.
[02:52:17.917 --> 02:52:25.883]  By taking One World Way, I know that I've detoxified my brain of mercury and excess glutamate, and I'm now functioning with this dramatic improvement in my mood.
[02:52:26.684 --> 02:52:31.445]  The power to change your life lies in part in the power you have to change your body's chemistry.
[02:52:31.665 --> 02:52:37.987]  Through diet and supplementation, you have the power to change your body's chemistry to support dramatic improvements in health and happiness.
[02:52:38.467 --> 02:52:43.429]  Nature has been and always will be mankind's first and only pharmacy to choose from.
[02:52:43.949 --> 02:52:46.890]  Change your chemistry and change your life with One World Way.
[02:52:47.270 --> 02:52:47.650]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:47.870]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:52:54.993 --> 02:53:06.781]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:53:07.121 --> 02:53:11.924]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:53:12.244 --> 02:53:13.966]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:53:14.426 --> 02:53:21.711]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:53:22.191 --> 02:53:25.513]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:53:25.893 --> 02:53:29.755]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:53:30.155 --> 02:53:36.398]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:53:36.838 --> 02:53:39.399]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:42.301]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:53:42.821 --> 02:53:46.183]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:53:46.463 --> 02:53:48.884]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:53:49.404 --> 02:53:54.066]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:53:54.366 --> 02:53:56.667]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:15.733]  No, they don't want us to know that they've produced artificial food designed to make us sick and mentally ill.
[02:54:15.773 --> 02:54:18.374]  They don't want you to know if you can't sleep, it's magnesium.
[02:54:19.531 --> 02:54:22.454]  They got a deadly class 3 narcotic for you.
[02:54:23.835 --> 02:54:29.160]  They don't want you to know you got rotholes in your skin because you don't have enough vitamin C. You got zits all over the place.
[02:54:29.521 --> 02:54:32.303]  They don't want you to know any of this stuff.
[02:54:32.704 --> 02:54:35.326]  By the way, Paul Watson's article is very powerful.
[02:54:35.386 --> 02:54:37.708]  It's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:38.029 --> 02:54:43.254]  DHS classifies new ammo purchases following controversy as they buy even more than 1.4 billion.
[02:54:46.171 --> 02:54:47.973]  And all these different agencies are getting it.
[02:54:48.973 --> 02:54:55.259]  The Post Office, the Social Security Administration, the National Weather Association.
[02:54:55.279 --> 02:54:57.922]  And one of the commenters makes a point of a meaning to make.
[02:54:58.562 --> 02:55:01.345]  Google excluded income is their name.
[02:55:02.366 --> 02:55:05.469]  And it's fact, hollow point bullets are illegal to use in war.
[02:55:05.709 --> 02:55:05.889]  Yep.
[02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:09.332]  Hollow point bullets are too expensive for practice uses.
[02:55:09.352 --> 02:55:10.253]  Correct?
[02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:15.943]  Hollow points are for our heads and torso and arms and legs.
[02:55:16.964 --> 02:55:21.508]  Yeah, I mean, these are bullets for us, 1.4 billion bullets.
[02:55:22.788 --> 02:55:30.975]  Ben, I just had to ask you, because you're a smart guy, what is your take on armored pillboxes, checkpoints getting set up, and 1.4 plus billion rounds of ammo for us?
[02:55:31.535 --> 02:55:33.557]  I mean, what are these criminal lunatics planning?
[02:55:34.088 --> 02:55:37.729]  Well, you know, it gets to what you were saying before we went to the break.
[02:55:38.089 --> 02:55:45.770]  We are at risk of losing our individual freedoms because we're not paying attention and we've abdicated our personal responsibility.
[02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:51.231]  When it comes to our health, nothing is more dramatic than this idea of medicalizing everything.
[02:55:51.911 --> 02:55:57.012]  The articles we were going to talk about, should doctors treat lack of exercise as a medical condition?
[02:55:57.032 --> 02:55:59.373]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive to get into that, but yeah.
[02:55:59.713 --> 02:56:00.634]  Here's my frustration.
[02:56:00.654 --> 02:56:07.579]  I've seen it work with family, Aaron Dykes, I lost 40 pounds, and then just am not in the habit of taking stuff all day, so I quit doing it.
[02:56:07.619 --> 02:56:08.400]  Now I'm back on it.
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:13.844]  Even when I know it's real myself, I'm so weak I can't fully commit, Ben.
[02:56:15.168 --> 02:56:15.728]  Well, you know what?
[02:56:15.748 --> 02:56:24.374]  You can't fully commit until you do, because once you do, you're not going to want to be without your Beyond Tangy Tangerine, your nutritional supplements.
[02:56:25.614 --> 02:56:28.796]  I take them once or twice a day, but you're supposed to take them three or four times a day.
[02:56:29.097 --> 02:56:31.158]  My point is, I've already seen dramatic results.
[02:56:31.538 --> 02:56:35.200]  I just can't believe how real this is and how hidden in plain view.
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:37.122]  Like, drink more water, you know?
[02:56:37.842 --> 02:56:38.563]  Oh, here's another one.
[02:56:38.623 --> 02:56:39.363]  Just breathing.
[02:56:39.463 --> 02:56:43.926]  One of the most powerful ways to lower your blood pressure is to practice diaphragmatic breathing.
[02:56:44.066 --> 02:56:51.312]  Simple oxygen can drop your blood pressure and get you off your antihypertensive drugs, your calcium channel blockers, and your beta blockers.
[02:56:51.352 --> 02:56:58.096]  And by the way, Alex, among the deadliest drugs of all, and there's a lot of deadly drugs, are these antihypertensive drugs.
[02:56:58.176 --> 02:57:06.442]  Now they want to give you the poly pill, which is a combination of different anti, uh, three or four antihypertensive drugs that you take in one pill.
[02:57:06.462 --> 02:57:07.423]  That's what I wanted to ask you.
[02:57:07.483 --> 02:57:07.843]  What's next?
[02:57:08.143 --> 02:57:10.624]  And your body's doing all this hyper stuff to keep you alive.
[02:57:10.884 --> 02:57:12.525]  You block it, you end up killing yourself.
[02:57:12.765 --> 02:57:21.489]  What do you make of all the big pharma documents in like five companies the last month coming out where they know their drugs are killing us and have no benefit and are laughing at us?
[02:57:21.549 --> 02:57:22.870]  I mean they're so evil.
[02:57:23.470 --> 02:57:25.632]  Have you heard about Propecia, the baldness drug now?
[02:57:25.732 --> 02:57:26.593]  Yes, tell us.
[02:57:27.233 --> 02:57:32.577]  Propecia is a baldness drug and now people are surprised that Merck has been hiding the side effects.
[02:57:32.597 --> 02:57:36.120]  The company that makes Propecia has been hiding all the side effects that are associated with this.
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.642]  But the bottom line here is we shouldn't be surprised.
[02:57:39.123 --> 02:57:43.686]  Because the mechanism of drugs is to block things in the body.
[02:57:43.967 --> 02:57:45.708]  That's why you have anti-hypertension.
[02:57:45.948 --> 02:57:46.128]  Yes.
[02:58:00.725 --> 02:58:02.326]  Diabolical, that's exactly right.
[02:58:02.366 --> 02:58:04.126]  You're playing with the body's chemistry.
[02:58:04.166 --> 02:58:11.890]  If you're on a prescription drug, Alex, your number one health objective needs to be to figure out how to get off that prescription drug.
[02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:21.834]  If you're on a prescription drug, it's not a matter of losing weight, it's not a matter of going to the gym, it's not a matter of eating better, it's a matter of getting off that prescription drug because it's killing you.
[02:58:22.054 --> 02:58:24.235]  And nutritional supplementation is your best strategy.
[02:58:24.815 --> 02:58:26.855]  Yeah, again, because supplements work with the body.
[02:58:26.895 --> 02:58:27.916]  We're designed for those.
[02:58:27.976 --> 02:58:31.156]  Drugs go, like you said, Darth Vader, put a gun to your head.
[02:58:31.577 --> 02:58:35.357]  Whereas the natural stuff just works with the body as a family.
[02:58:35.737 --> 02:58:36.478]  Simiotic.
[02:58:36.598 --> 02:58:37.118]  Incredible.
[02:58:37.178 --> 02:58:38.458]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:58:41.919 --> 02:58:43.299]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.879 --> 02:58:45.980]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.912 --> 02:58:55.896]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:58:56.057 --> 02:58:58.819]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:58:59.019 --> 02:59:04.123]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:59:04.403 --> 02:59:09.126]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:59:09.387 --> 02:59:16.692]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:59:17.012 --> 02:59:20.714]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:59:20.874 --> 02:59:22.455]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:59:22.675 --> 02:59:26.537]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:59:26.697 --> 02:59:29.318]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:59:29.598 --> 02:59:32.240]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:36.802]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:59:36.942 --> 02:59:37.462]  Don't wait!
[02:59:37.602 --> 02:59:42.645]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:42.845 --> 02:59:43.065]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:59:45.086 --> 02:59:47.167]  Or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:47.347 --> 02:59:49.289]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:51.950]  Coast to coast.
[02:59:52.331 --> 02:59:53.631]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.392 --> 02:59:58.475]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:00.336 --> 03:00:00.976]  Cover-ups.
[03:00:01.577 --> 03:00:02.237]  You want answers?
[03:00:03.498 --> 03:00:05.439]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:05.819 --> 03:00:07.620]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:08.261 --> 03:00:09.742]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.302 --> 03:00:19.404]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we have now come back and reached our tail.
[03:00:20.205 --> 03:00:21.945]  This is the fourth hour we're starting.
[03:00:21.965 --> 03:00:24.006]  We're live at Retransmission coming up.
[03:00:24.507 --> 03:00:27.948]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is working with us over at Infowarsteam.com.
[03:00:28.549 --> 03:00:34.292]  Went through a lot of the vitamins and minerals and known illnesses and diseases that are triggered by lack of that.
[03:00:35.933 --> 03:00:44.837]  There's no way these medical doctors are that stupid that when they see people coming in with rotholes and their skin falling off, they don't ask, hey, do you eat leafy vegetables and fruits?
[03:00:44.977 --> 03:00:46.278]  Are you taking any vitamin C?
[03:00:46.818 --> 03:00:51.100]  No, instead they got some, you know, antibiotic for them because they got rotholes or whatever.
[03:00:51.581 --> 03:00:55.543]  Or if you've got, you know, acne everywhere, they don't tell you, hey, it's this vitamin, this mineral.
[03:00:55.843 --> 03:00:59.865]  They got a bunch of topical stuff for you and acids to dry out your skin.
[03:00:59.905 --> 03:01:01.345]  I mean, that's a perfect example right there.
[03:01:01.365 --> 03:01:03.166]  I know you're really a big skin expert.
[03:01:05.097 --> 03:01:07.238]  Finishing up with some of the news articles you wanted to hit.
[03:01:08.139 --> 03:01:08.719]  Fluoride.
[03:01:08.759 --> 03:01:15.542]  I want to talk about this dentist who's telling us that bottled water might be bad for kids' teeth because it doesn't have fluoride.
[03:01:15.562 --> 03:01:18.144]  And I love how the mainstream media just jumped all over this.
[03:01:18.784 --> 03:01:21.305]  If you look at any website... Well, it's a hoax!
[03:01:21.325 --> 03:01:26.208]  The government's being forced to take it out of the water, admitting it's deadly, but have one dentist come out.
[03:01:26.468 --> 03:01:28.429]  Oh, they can all act like it's good because he says so.
[03:01:29.338 --> 03:01:39.871]  Well, fluoride singularly upsets the brain, especially a gland in the brain called the pineal gland, which takes up fluoride faster than any other tissue in the body.
[03:01:39.891 --> 03:01:47.441]  The pineal gland is the center of melatonin production, of serotonin production, and we know that serotonin drugs are the best-selling drugs in the world.
[03:01:48.341 --> 03:01:56.889]  The pineal gland is responsible for how we perceive reality itself, and it is singularly dependent on minerals like iodine.
[03:01:56.929 --> 03:02:01.933]  By the way, iodine supplementation is one of the best ways to protect yourself from fluoride.
[03:02:02.253 --> 03:02:09.860]  For people who are stuck drinking tap water, which I definitely don't recommend, but if you're stuck drinking it, make sure that you're using iodine supplementation.
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:11.861]  The pineal gland loves iodine.
[03:02:11.921 --> 03:02:15.825]  It will take in fluoride under iodine deficiency states.
[03:02:16.385 --> 03:02:19.887]  And this whole idea of bottled water is another problem too.
[03:02:19.927 --> 03:02:26.030]  I mean, our only option really is bottled water, but there are plasticizers in bottles that are also a big problem.
[03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:27.731]  Some of them act like estrogen.
[03:02:27.771 --> 03:02:39.637]  If you're stuck drinking bottled water, because you don't want to drink tap water, make sure that you're using nutritional supplements that will protect you from some of the toxicity associated with these bottled water ingredients.
[03:02:40.698 --> 03:02:42.859]  Ingredients in the bottles of bottled water.
[03:02:42.899 --> 03:02:44.920]  Essential fatty acids are very, very important.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:45.460]  We're good to go.
[03:03:07.191 --> 03:03:07.751]  Exactly.
[03:03:07.791 --> 03:03:14.995]  For folks worried about radioactivity, for folks worried about heavy metals, when you give yourself the good stuff, your body will selectively take that in.
[03:03:15.455 --> 03:03:20.838]  As far as this Bisphenol A and some of the hardeners that they use in plastics that act like estrogen mimics, and it's other things too.
[03:03:20.918 --> 03:03:27.681]  Cosmetics can act like estrogen mimics, preservatives can act like estrogen mimics, fragrances and perfumes can mimic estrogen.
[03:03:27.981 --> 03:03:33.324]  To protect yourself from estrogen mimics, you want to use essential fatty acids, you want to use foods like broccoli,
[03:03:33.784 --> 03:03:38.645]  And cauliflower, the cruciferous vegetables, and you want to make sure you're getting enough iodine.
[03:03:38.905 --> 03:03:40.926]  This is so, so important.
[03:03:40.946 --> 03:03:51.029]  I don't hear anybody talking about the importance of iodine for protection against excess estrogen, for protection of the pineal gland, for protection of the breast tissue, for protection of the adrenal glands.
[03:03:51.069 --> 03:03:54.590]  People will tell you, doctors will tell you, oh you get enough iodine from iodized salt.
[03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:55.750]  Not true!
[03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:58.411]  And it's even the wrong kind of iodine as well.
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:03.662]  Well, I like Modafilin, which isn't a longevity product, but we have it at Infowarshop.com.
[03:04:03.702 --> 03:04:04.482]  I talked to a lot of folks.
[03:04:04.963 --> 03:04:08.804]  I really like the way this makes me feel and what it's doing for me.
[03:04:08.864 --> 03:04:10.345]  A lot of folks, I know Will Weldon.
[03:04:10.805 --> 03:04:16.288]  Weldon is the one that first turned me on to it, and I asked a bunch of different doctors and scientists about it.
[03:04:16.328 --> 03:04:18.829]  I really like the brown seaweed from New Zealand myself.
[03:04:19.594 --> 03:04:21.835]  Seaweed is amazing, amazing stuff.
[03:04:21.875 --> 03:04:23.816]  If you can, the more seaweed you eat, the better.
[03:04:23.836 --> 03:04:31.479]  Of course, we know the oceans are pretty toxic, but seaweed actually has an ability to sequester some of the toxins that are found in ocean water.
[03:04:31.539 --> 03:04:37.982]  So eating seaweed is not only a great way to get iodine, it's a wonderful source of iodine, it's a great source of B vitamins, it's a great source of protein.
[03:04:38.283 --> 03:04:39.543]  So it's almost a key layer.
[03:04:39.623 --> 03:04:41.144]  It's helping drag stuff out of your body.
[03:04:41.624 --> 03:04:42.645]  That's exactly right.
[03:04:42.665 --> 03:04:43.185]  It's all right.
[03:04:43.225 --> 03:04:46.728]  Listen, we're going to post this interview that was live at Infowarsteam.com.
[03:04:47.008 --> 03:04:52.712]  If you missed any of it out there, and Aaron Dyke's testimony with the fore and after, it's up at Infowarsteam.com.
[03:04:52.972 --> 03:04:54.753]  Thank you so much, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[03:04:55.173 --> 03:04:55.894]  Great job.
[03:04:56.234 --> 03:04:59.416]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:05:00.217 --> 03:05:02.939]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[03:05:03.239 --> 03:05:06.141]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economy.
