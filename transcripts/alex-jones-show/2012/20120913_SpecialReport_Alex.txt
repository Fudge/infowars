[00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:12.317]  President Trump!
[00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:13.681]  President Trump!
[00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:25.640]  While chants of President Paul have long been silenced, the Congressman's supporters may still have an unexpected opportunity to get Ron Paul elected to high office.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.501]  That's because in 2014, the seat for Texas Governor will be open.
[00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:43.866]  While a spokesperson for the Congressman has stated to InfoWars that the doctor is not interested in the position, many activists can argue that a large-scale grassroots effort promoting this idea could prompt him to reconsider.
[00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:58.137]  Current Texas Governor Rick Perry has stated he does intend to seek re-election, despite the fact he has already held this position for 12 years, and a recent Dallas Morning News poll shows a majority of Texans don't think he should run again.
[00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:03.980]  I recently asked visitors at the Texas Capitol building in Austin what they thought of this possibility.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.522]  Do you think Ron Paul should run for Governor of Texas?
[00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:07.182]  Yes.
[00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:08.643]  Why?
[00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:10.935]  I think he's a good politician.
[00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:15.219]  He gives the rights to the people, not as much government interference, which is something I prefer.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.343]  He's also a very confident politician, very experienced, and I believe he'd do a great job.
[00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:22.465]  Do you think he has a shot of winning?
[00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:31.733]  Possibly, if he gets his message out there and really conveys to the people that the best interest in his mind is Texans.
[00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:33.023]  I think he should.
[00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:33.123]  Yeah.
[00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:39.246]  I mean, he seems like a guy that might actually do a little bit better than Rick Perry.
[00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.047]  He seems to be a little bit more caring for people and stuff like that.
[00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:42.647]  You know what I mean?
[00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:44.668]  Do you think Ron Paul would have a shot of winning?
[00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:45.768]  A realistic shot of winning?
[00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.309]  Not really.
[00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.951]  Do you think Ron Paul should run for Governor of Texas?
[00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:52.851]  No, I don't.
[00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:54.012]  I really don't.
[00:01:54.772 --> 00:01:55.092]  Why not?
[00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:56.593]  I don't care for him too much.
[00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:59.014]  I just don't care for his policies and some of the things he stands for.
[00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:01.262]  Do you think he could win if he ran?
[00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:03.644]  Probably not.
[00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.426]  It's hard to tell, but I don't think so.
[00:02:08.947 --> 00:02:14.571]  A lot of people don't care for some of his issues, but some he has that are good, but the underlying things I really don't care for.
[00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:18.994]  I don't think so because he doesn't really have any experience in governing.
[00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:21.836]  Do you think he could win if he ran for governor of Texas?
[00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:23.056]  I don't think so.
[00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:24.497]  Why not?
[00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:30.688]  He's too much of an individual and not part of the machine.
[00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.571]  You have to be part of the machine here in order to win.
[00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:38.315]  If Ron Paul were to win the election, he would be 79 years old on election day.
[00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:48.844]  While some may argue that his elder age would be viewed as a negative to his campaign, it is important to note that he would have been serving as a public servant at this age had he won the presidency.
[00:02:49.605 --> 00:03:00.493]  Advocates can also argue that a statewide campaign would be far less taxing on the congressman and his family than a national campaign, and that he can choose to serve for just one term.
[00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:10.421]  In a recent blog posted by former Paul spokesman Doug Weed, he states that he does not rule out the possibility that Dr. Paul will run for public office again.
[00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:13.204]  However, he was referring to a presidential run.
[00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:20.553]  A recent University of Texas poll shows that most state residents are happy with the direction the state is currently going in.
[00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:24.996]  I've been reading a few articles about people that are wrongly convicted and to me that's kind of disheartening because
[00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:51.470]  You know, I don't know anybody personally that was in that situation, but from hearing their stories and stuff like that, you know, it kind of devastates their family.
[00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.134]  I'd like to see any governor or any candidate for governor address the death penalty and speak about abolishing it again.
[00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.016]  It's very unjust.
[00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.277]  Always fighting on behalf of liberty.
[00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:06.099]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
