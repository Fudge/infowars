[00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.727]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:11.168]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:12.908]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.771]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.791]  I'm good.
[00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:23.459]  I'll keep this world from dragging me down, gonna stay.
[00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.666]  I will stand my ground.
[00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:03.486]  And I won't
[00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:32.044]  Back down.
[00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:40.692]  Well, we've got another super-packed transmission lined up for you today.
[00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:54.766]  We have a top professor joining us who is, amongst many in academia, warning of the fact that it is a probability that artificial intelligence from machines
[00:02:55.794 --> 00:03:01.136]  Will dominate our society and will end up enslaving humanity.
[00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:14.079]  It is a hundred percent certainty that the global technocratic engineers are attempting to establish a technocracy in their own words over us using technology to track, trace and control everything we're doing.
[00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:20.501]  And that by building that system they'll probably fall into the pit that they've dug for us.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.421]  So, that is coming up.
[00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:26.981]  Here was one of the articles in MSNBC last week.
[00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:33.083]  Control dangerous AI before it controls us, experts says.
[00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:36.844]  And it's that professor that will be joining us.
[00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:40.606]  Good job of the crew getting them lined up.
[00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:47.928]  For the show, one of his papers is leak-proofing the singularity artificial intelligence confinement problem.
[00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:56.269]  Instead, all the AI, and a lot of this stuff is already artificially intelligent to a certain degree.
[00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.070]  The question is, is it self-aware?
[00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.511]  It doesn't matter.
[00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:04.494]  If a drone's launched and goes around killing certain targets, making its own decisions, that's been going on for 20 years.
[00:04:04.814 --> 00:04:06.796]  They just now announced it last year to the slaves.
[00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:08.917]  It is autonomous.
[00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:10.278]  It is artificially intelligent.
[00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:11.378]  It's flying around killing people.
[00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.199]  On its own.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.221]  Under its own programming.
[00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:18.142]  It's been programmed, but it's like a wind-up toy.
[00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:18.983]  You turn it loose.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.682]  And so the very architecture of this system is a Skynet type scenario where it launches a big attack on humanity.
[00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.203]  So this is an area I'm obviously very concerned with.
[00:04:29.223 --> 00:04:30.143]  I hope you're concerned with it.
[00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:33.805]  We'll be breaking that down on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:34.765]  And then...
[00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.882]  I told you it was going to happen, but I didn't know it was going to happen this quick.
[00:04:41.902 --> 00:04:43.964]  I've just been proven absolutely correct yet again.
[00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.525]  Not really hard to do.
[00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:57.736]  The Congress is moving for a full African invasion, continent-wide, and Angelina Jolie is at the World Criminal Court worshipping it, saying this is her jihad for global government.
[00:04:58.637 --> 00:04:59.338]  That's all coming up.
[00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:02.126]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:07.508]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:12.391]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:17.814]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:23.039]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.502]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:30.487]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:31.589]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.572]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:38.156]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:41.317]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.557]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:44.798]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:44.998]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:47.959]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.199]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.813]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:18.325]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.707]  eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:06.622]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:12.547]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:19.732]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:23.956]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:28.079]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:34.051]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.852]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:39.393]  Others don't.
[00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.674]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:43.454]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:46.296]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:52.878]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:55.459]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:57.980]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.181]  Others don't.
[00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:06.000]  Texas Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.502]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:32.231]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today as we kick off this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:43.099]  It is the 14th day of March 2012 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:50.384]  We do have a professor and expert in artificial intelligence who's warning the public
[00:08:51.178 --> 00:08:58.603]  The technocratic system's being built that will basically give rise to a computer artificially intelligent dictatorship.
[00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:03.927]  He will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:06.189 --> 00:09:13.914]  Also, we may have a surprise guest in the third hour, or I may just do it in the TV studio, the interview tonight.
[00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:19.338]  I'm not sure exactly which is going to happen, but it's of a Dave Mustaine level.
[00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:29.328]  And by the way, the Dave Mustaine interview that we shot last week is going to air tomorrow night in place of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:33.772]  And I'm very glad that InfoWars Nightly News is so popular.
[00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:42.359]  I've had quite a few complaints pouring in from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that, hey Alex, we want fresh new shows every night at 7.
[00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:46.162]  You know, I planned to do the news for a few months straight, beta testing.
[00:09:46.202 --> 00:09:46.983]  I said this was beta.
[00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:50.480]  Because PrisonPlanet.tv has all of my films.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.842]  Now nine years of material coming up.
[00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:56.183]  April 12th is when we launched it.
[00:09:58.764 --> 00:09:59.605]  All those years ago.
[00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.426]  I guess nine years ago.
[00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:07.650]  And we are about to launch a new contest.
[00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:24.313]  It'll be $5,000 for male reporters, $5,000 for female reporters, and then you get a shot at being an InfoWars reporter and anchor, and reaching an audience of three million people a day.
[00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:33.101]  So, I meant to launch this three, four months ago, and I'm so busy, and my skeleton crew is so busy,
[00:10:34.773 --> 00:10:39.458]  Just trying to get the nightly news on every night and doing investigative reports and going out on the street.
[00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.560]  We've only got a team of like five people.
[00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.883]  We've got to hire three or four more people.
[00:10:44.864 --> 00:10:47.447]  And we've got to put in a bunch of new upgrades and equipment.
[00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:48.774]  I don't know.
[00:11:05.876 --> 00:11:13.298]  With a Dave Mustaine exclusive interview tomorrow, my two-hour speech in Orlando next week, some other special reports.
[00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:32.964]  Some nights it'll be new stuff, but a few nights we're not because I have to drop some things because I can't cut a promo video about the contest for hiring reporters if I'm busy trying to do the nightly news or my crew is.
[00:11:34.072 --> 00:11:37.177]  I can't cut a new promo video for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:47.210]  I can't go over all the resumes we've already got for video editors, writers, researchers, investigative reporters when we've got hundreds of them already that I am literally
[00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:49.119]  In an ocean of.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:12:04.348]  And so we've had incredible success, and I appreciate your support, but I will probably in four or five months again, after these reporters are hired, trained, in place, the new equipment's in, we have the new sharing upload system to deliver the show to television.
[00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:13.494]  See, another thing is the show's already getting picked up by different cable systems, broadcast TV, big national British basic cable does a two-hour compilation.
[00:12:14.054 --> 00:12:16.236]  I've got to create a list of the stations we're already on.
[00:12:17.176 --> 00:12:21.038]  I mean, we're already getting on in Europe and England and areas of the U.S.
[00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:22.278]  without even trying.
[00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:25.920]  You know, we just get emailed by a cable system, hey, can we pick the show up?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.141]  I'm like, yeah, boom, hit it.
[00:12:27.861 --> 00:12:37.945]  I mean, there's just, there's so much going on around here that I've got to jump off the treadmill for five seconds, just so I can try to let the dust halfway settle.
[00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:38.866]  And in between that,
[00:12:41.912 --> 00:12:47.156]  I've got 50 other irons in the fire and big breaking news and all this going on.
[00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:51.280]  So I did make the announcement on Monday.
[00:12:52.287 --> 00:12:58.051]  That we were going to have, you know, two-week hiatus with some new shows and special events for viewers.
[00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:02.173]  But I'm really heartened by folks saying, hey, we want the news, we're addicted to this.
[00:13:02.613 --> 00:13:17.543]  You know, there are about 50,000 people a night, which is tiny compared to the radio audience, that tune in to PrisonPlanet.tv throughout the first airing of the show at 7 Central and then the re-streaming of it until the next day.
[00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:19.535]  And then the archiving of it.
[00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:24.846]  And of course, we do allow, each membership is really six memberships.
[00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:32.778]  Each membership with the same username and passcode that you create, six people can be logged in simultaneously.
[00:13:32.818 --> 00:13:36.201]  So it's really six memberships for 15 cents a day.
[00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:40.144]  And I am glad that people are sharing their memberships.
[00:13:40.164 --> 00:13:44.207]  We've got a lot better servers now where it almost never has problem streaming.
[00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:47.970]  There's been a lot going into this because we're doing it from the ground floor up.
[00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:54.692]  We never had the money to hire big consultants and big companies or try to have a big official studio put in.
[00:13:54.712 --> 00:13:56.253]  I could have never built this.
[00:13:56.293 --> 00:14:04.516]  We've done it from the ground up on a shoestring budget, and now we're getting to really try to go to the next level and bloom.
[00:14:05.437 --> 00:14:09.558]  But it takes a lot, and we couldn't have done it without you.
[00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:15.621]  And then it looks like for the nightly news, we're going to have another big interview for you next week.
[00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:32.207]  Because I went to dinner with a well-known individual who's shown that they're very awake to what's going on in the world, and invited them to come in, and they're like, well, I'm not sure, you know, I don't know how much I'll end up saying.
[00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:36.871]  And I said, okay, whatever you want to do, and they contacted me this morning, I need to get back in touch with them, they want to come in.
[00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:38.532]  So that's another big interview.
[00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:45.218]  We've just got a lot going on here, and I need to get the new people
[00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:53.618]  Hired, trained, in place so that we've got enough people to basically hit the balls that are coming at us.
[00:14:54.118 --> 00:15:12.663]  It's kind of like I got four or five guys lined up with their baseball bats and there's 20 machine pitchers out there, pitching machines, shooting fastballs at us.
[00:15:13.444 --> 00:15:23.353]  And we're hitting a lot of home runs here, but I realize I need to get more people out front on my team so they can really start knocking home runs and try to hit every one of those balls.
[00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:26.395]  I mean, I need to hire three or four people just to go through the email every day.
[00:15:26.515 --> 00:15:27.056]  Don't have the money.
[00:15:27.536 --> 00:15:34.542]  I need to hire people just to moderate the comments on the message boards, because you can get, you know, sued all day for that stuff.
[00:15:34.842 --> 00:15:39.446]  People posting copyright stuff, people posting phone numbers, people saying, go kill this person.
[00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:45.054]  I've got to get more than just part-time moderators in there.
[00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:51.578]  I'm finally getting ready to launch the social network after years of being on the treadmill.
[00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:56.240]  I'm always running so fast on the treadmill here with the syndicated radio show and the rest of it.
[00:15:57.821 --> 00:16:01.943]  The radio show reaches around 3 million people a day, 15 million a week conservatively.
[00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:21.919]  The Nightly News only reaches about 50,000 a day that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, but then it gets posted to our YouTube channel and hundreds of others, and a conservative estimate is the Nightly News gets watched by about 2 million people a week just on YouTube and a few other video systems.
[00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:28.621]  Like I said, it's on the basic cable England-wide through an organization group that has a channel.
[00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:30.962]  That has a couple hundred thousand viewers.
[00:16:31.002 --> 00:16:34.083]  We've looked at the ratings when the show airs every, what, Sunday evening.
[00:16:35.823 --> 00:16:39.485]  And there's all sorts of TV stations around the country picking it up and cable systems.
[00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:40.965]  I mean, it's crazy what's happening.
[00:16:41.325 --> 00:16:46.267]  So when we finally put out a honed one-hour show, this has all just been beta testing right now.
[00:16:47.662 --> 00:17:10.156]  When we finally do put this out, and to be able to put out the official show quicker, there may be a few times in the next six months where I have to get pulling for a pit stop and get new tires, new gas in the engine, some oil shot into the engine, so that I can really then race back out there on the track and go 300 and defeat the Globalist.
[00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:11.937]  And we're doing it all together.
[00:17:12.858 --> 00:17:16.781]  Okay, there's some basic program notes for you today.
[00:17:16.801 --> 00:17:20.405]  When we come back, I'm very disgusted by this.
[00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:24.709]  I am basically distraught over this subject.
[00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.772]  Again, we've been proven absolutely devastatingly accurate.
[00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:32.055]  And you would think that I'd be happy about that.
[00:17:32.075 --> 00:17:32.115]  No.
[00:17:33.638 --> 00:17:33.898]  No.
[00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:41.503]  It only makes me sad for basic humankind, how gullible we've become, how one-dimensional the general public has become.
[00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:45.586]  Either you're waking up and becoming enlightened, or you're getting more into a trance.
[00:17:46.246 --> 00:17:47.767]  We are in a narcoleptic state.
[00:17:49.388 --> 00:17:50.969]  That is the best way to describe it.
[00:17:53.499 --> 00:18:01.493]  Last night I was sitting there for like 10 minutes having dinner with a very interesting individual and I was trying to describe they're in a trance, they're under a spell, it's like they're not awake.
[00:18:01.974 --> 00:18:05.801]  The brainwaves, he goes, yeah, no, it's an artificially induced narcoleptic state.
[00:18:10.168 --> 00:18:14.351]  And that's what it is, and I'm here to try to get people out of their narcoleptic state.
[00:18:14.451 --> 00:18:19.235]  Sure, I'm abrasive, I'm obnoxious, I'm all of those things, but you know what?
[00:18:19.355 --> 00:18:24.840]  No one has been as effective as I have, with my crew and you supporting us.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:34.768]  And so anytime I get down on myself, because believe me, I'm my worst critic, I realize, hey, you're doing the best job you can, so stop getting down on yourself!
[00:18:36.544 --> 00:18:43.510]  Because believe me, my biggest hurdle is a self-loathing that I'm not doing enough and that I'm not fighting hard enough.
[00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:48.314]  That's why people call and say how great I am or people on the street tell me how great I am.
[00:18:48.634 --> 00:18:55.620]  It's like punching me in the stomach and I don't know how to explain it because I feel like I'm doing the bare minimum I should be doing.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:04.788]  I don't know how to... I just have a responsibility and I don't understand how other people don't have a feeling of responsibility to fight these murdering scum.
[00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:09.874]  It's not, I'm not a hero, I'm not a good guy, I'm none of those things.
[00:19:10.354 --> 00:19:12.635]  It's basic survival, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:13.715 --> 00:19:17.857]  We've got to get past this idea that it's exceptional to fight evil.
[00:19:19.498 --> 00:19:24.600]  We have evil running wild all over us because we believe fighting evil is exceptional.
[00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:27.562]  Fighting evil is the bare minimum.
[00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:30.723]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.765]  And my whole body, my whole spirit is, do more.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.921]  Because I understand the threat.
[00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:40.644]  Now, I told you it was coming.
[00:19:41.244 --> 00:19:43.746]  The Congress is moving for an African-wide invasion.
[00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:44.847]  Their words, not mine.
[00:19:46.038 --> 00:19:48.560]  With a complete blank check for scorched earth everywhere.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.784]  The UN is involved in genocide all over Africa from Uganda to Ivory Coast right now.
[00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:58.507]  Angelina Jolie has gone to the World Court to basically call for global government.
[00:19:59.368 --> 00:20:01.049]  Everything I said is now about to expand.
[00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:02.370]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.774]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:09.595]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[00:20:09.835 --> 00:20:12.638]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[00:20:13.018 --> 00:20:13.419]  It's true.
[00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:16.081]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:20:16.302 --> 00:20:18.103]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:23.288]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:25.751]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:30.756]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:31.797]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:32.037 --> 00:20:38.400]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:41.562]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:43.803]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:45.064]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:45.084 --> 00:20:45.444]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:45.464 --> 00:20:48.226]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:48.726 --> 00:20:50.447]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:08.083]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:21:30.507 --> 00:21:31.568]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:36.131]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:42.035]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.537]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:50.520]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:53.402]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:00.547 --> 00:22:02.047]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:03.388]  Leave me a message.
[00:22:03.468 --> 00:22:04.588]  Claire, it's Ann.
[00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:07.549]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:08.429]  The all-natural one.
[00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:09.029]  Ambrin?
[00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:10.290]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:17.691]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:19.492]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:20.092]  It's gone.
[00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:22.373]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[00:22:22.593 --> 00:22:23.253]  I feel great.
[00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:23.933]  Give me a call.
[00:22:24.073 --> 00:22:27.574]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:22:27.754 --> 00:22:31.295]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:35.797]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[00:22:35.977 --> 00:22:38.098]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:41.139]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:45.680]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[00:24:03.883 --> 00:24:15.809]  I can see a day coming when even having your own home garden is going to be against the law.
[00:24:35.648 --> 00:24:42.072]  By the way, the Secretary of Defense was arriving in Afghanistan and a big car bomb went off.
[00:24:44.974 --> 00:24:50.817]  Who knows if that's them bombing themselves to try to, you know, make the war look legitimate and continuent.
[00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:57.121]  You had this military man reportedly go in and now kill 18 people at like 3 a.m.
[00:24:57.141 --> 00:25:00.704]  in Afghanistan inside their houses, women and children.
[00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:04.001]  And the media's like, why would a soldier do that?
[00:25:04.021 --> 00:25:05.623]  I don't know, you serve five, six tourers.
[00:25:07.805 --> 00:25:11.930]  One out of a hundred, sometimes more, are gonna go crazy.
[00:25:13.031 --> 00:25:15.194]  And they're gonna go crazy on top of the UT Tower.
[00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:18.878]  They're gonna go crazy in your house.
[00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:23.323]  And when it happens, they're gonna demonize 99% of the veterans that aren't like that.
[00:25:24.462 --> 00:25:34.869]  But the system knows that by overworking the troops, putting them in immoral combat, they know, back to World War I, they're going to get these type of mass murder events.
[00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:46.516]  And then they're going to use it to take the rights of all veterans across the board and make you quote the number one enemy of homeland security, the number one threat, which of course you're not.
[00:25:49.318 --> 00:25:52.300]  But in it is the kernel of truth that they will end up using.
[00:25:54.551 --> 00:26:05.593]  But it is scary when some crazed veteran cop pulls you over and is in some type of murderous rage, and I've seen the videos online of it for no reason, and just starts beating people up or shoots them.
[00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:11.894]  You know, sometimes you turn somebody into a killing machine, they don't know how to turn it off.
[00:26:14.274 --> 00:26:22.976]  I mean, I don't think of myself as the toughest, baddest guy on the block, but my problem is when people start fights with me, my problem is I want to get in a fight.
[00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:34.937]  And I'm older and realize that's weakness, so I know I've learned how to control myself, but I can't imagine if I'd been trained to be a soldier and been in five, six tours of combat, and was just used to killing people all the time, what that would be like.
[00:26:35.497 --> 00:26:40.059]  Shooting somebody is like punching somebody in the nose when you've done it that long, from veterans I've talked to.
[00:26:44.842 --> 00:26:45.983]  Alright, I've already digressed.
[00:26:48.103 --> 00:26:48.663]  Let me do this.
[00:26:48.784 --> 00:26:52.186]  I'm going to get into the African invasion that's been announced after this short segment.
[00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:53.967]  We start the next long segment.
[00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:59.051]  But I look at this constellation of news here in front of me.
[00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:03.239]  Why are millions of Americans preparing for doomsday?
[00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:07.181]  Big article from the Economic Collapse blog that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:09.722]  There's another big survey out.
[00:27:10.022 --> 00:27:10.943]  Doomsday Survey.
[00:27:11.483 --> 00:27:14.024]  51% of Americans believe a financial collapse is imminent.
[00:27:15.465 --> 00:27:18.086]  85% say country is overwhelmingly under-prepared.
[00:27:19.547 --> 00:27:27.991]  Meanwhile, the Feds are building bunkers and armoring their facilities and hoarding food and water and weapons everywhere and saying, we're bad if we do it.
[00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:34.092]  They're running around like an anthill that's been disturbed, getting ready for something.
[00:27:35.634 --> 00:27:36.656]  And I've looked at the math.
[00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:46.970]  It is a mathematical certainty on the course that we're on, by design, we are going to continue to slide incrementally into a deeper and deeper depression.
[00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:49.743]  And all the numbers are out there.
[00:27:50.063 --> 00:27:56.829]  60 Minutes even a year and a half ago had a piece admitting we were in a depression and unemployment was 22% and 33% in California.
[00:27:57.189 --> 00:27:58.430]  It's much worse than that now.
[00:27:58.751 --> 00:28:00.432]  Inflation's over 10%.
[00:28:00.752 --> 00:28:02.814]  It's not 3 or 4% like they say.
[00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:04.075]  You know that.
[00:28:04.295 --> 00:28:04.796]  I know that.
[00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:05.876]  Everything costs more.
[00:28:05.896 --> 00:28:11.381]  And Americans... There's a certain point... Joseph Goebbels wrote about this.
[00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:13.983]  I've read a lot of his writings and a lot of his work got picked up.
[00:28:14.463 --> 00:28:15.965]  Well, he stole a lot of work from Edward Bernays.
[00:28:18.524 --> 00:28:21.026]  It was big propaganda for the Department of War here in the U.S.
[00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:25.790]  Wrote the book called Propaganda, but actually wrote the book on propaganda.
[00:28:27.492 --> 00:28:31.836]  And Goebbels said, hey, at a certain point, we've got to start being honest with the Germans.
[00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:33.397]  This is once World War II was going.
[00:28:34.278 --> 00:28:37.641]  Because if we're telling them we're winning all the battles and we're not, we lose all credibility.
[00:28:38.201 --> 00:28:39.563]  We've got to start being more honest.
[00:28:40.708 --> 00:28:44.350]  That's kind of like Baghdad Bob as explosions are going off five miles behind him.
[00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:45.471]  You can see him and hear him.
[00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:48.593]  He's going, there are no Americans pigs here.
[00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:52.116]  They are, they have been kicked out of Iraq completely.
[00:28:52.496 --> 00:28:54.357]  And you, you know, you see explosions behind him.
[00:28:54.377 --> 00:28:58.900]  And you hear jets flying over.
[00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:01.502]  And that's what the New World Order is like.
[00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:02.663]  They're like Baghdad Bob.
[00:29:02.683 --> 00:29:03.884]  We ought to do a news piece on that.
[00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:07.352]  The American pigs are not even in Iraq.
[00:29:07.592 --> 00:29:09.753]  They have all been defeated.
[00:29:10.434 --> 00:29:10.834]  Same thing.
[00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:12.175]  There's no depression.
[00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:12.955]  Everything's fine.
[00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:14.216]  We're not in a police state.
[00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:17.277]  The TSA's not abusing you, sticking their hands in your pants.
[00:29:19.818 --> 00:29:21.539]  Oh, everybody's real healthy.
[00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:23.480]  Sure, cancer's up a few thousand percentage points.
[00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:31.757]  So, people are not buying what the government says anymore, or the mainstream media.
[00:29:31.777 --> 00:29:35.598]  The problem is, just because they don't buy what they're being told, they still don't know what's going on.
[00:29:36.298 --> 00:29:47.081]  I mean, if the public knew what I know, what you know, if they really knew how deep the rabbit hole went, which is bottomless, then there'd be a whole nother situation.
[00:29:48.082 --> 00:29:49.322]  We'll be back with the big news.
[00:29:50.182 --> 00:29:51.082]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:53.083]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.112 --> 00:29:56.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:07.825]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:30:08.065 --> 00:30:25.674]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:30.056]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:30:30.336 --> 00:30:31.897]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:39.963]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:30:40.263 --> 00:30:46.527]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:30:46.587 --> 00:30:47.628]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:48.588]  It's incredible.
[00:30:48.748 --> 00:30:57.774]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:30:57.955 --> 00:30:59.796]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:00.596 --> 00:31:04.838]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.158 --> 00:31:05.759]  Number one.
[00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:09.220]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.481 --> 00:31:10.061]  Number two.
[00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:14.903]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.243 --> 00:31:15.684]  It's true.
[00:31:15.984 --> 00:31:20.546]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:21.406]  Number three.
[00:31:21.686 --> 00:31:24.968]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.268 --> 00:31:28.970]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:29.711]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:32.333]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:36.116]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:36.617]  Number 5.
[00:31:37.197 --> 00:31:41.120]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.341 --> 00:31:46.105]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.385 --> 00:31:50.410]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.132]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.352 --> 00:31:54.435]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:54.595 --> 00:31:56.958]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:01.448 --> 00:32:02.950]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:08.177]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:08.477 --> 00:32:09.839]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:18.791]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:19.532 --> 00:32:26.639]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:34.686]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:39.991]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.473]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:48.139]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:32:50.801 --> 00:32:52.943]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:33:15.323 --> 00:33:16.504]  Oh, you have found it!
[00:33:19.926 --> 00:33:23.349]  The front lines of the info war!
[00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:30.014]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, attempting in my own little way to resist tyranny.
[00:33:30.254 --> 00:33:43.363]  I know the power of humanity, I know the power of the human spirit, and all you need to do is to stop second-guessing yourself like I know I've done, and just take action, and commit to the fight for liberty, and that will build a better world.
[00:33:45.336 --> 00:33:56.925]  But deciding that we can't stop corruption and also not researching propaganda, but just accepting it on the surface is the mother of all of our problems.
[00:33:58.527 --> 00:33:58.887]  All right.
[00:34:00.128 --> 00:34:01.029]  I want to be clear here.
[00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.031]  I've done deep research on Africa.
[00:34:04.091 --> 00:34:11.077]  I've done deep research on the all-encompassing geopolitical tectonic
[00:34:13.749 --> 00:34:17.753]  Shifts that have taken place in the last few centuries.
[00:34:21.437 --> 00:34:34.311]  And undoubtedly, there is a global proxy war going on in Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, of course, Eastern Europe,
[00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:38.471]  Africa, Latin America.
[00:34:39.112 --> 00:34:51.303]  There are mercenaries, the bankers call them jackals, all over the world assassinating and killing people 24-7 that won't give in to the big six megabanks and their fractional reserve banking derivatives fraud machine.
[00:34:55.206 --> 00:35:00.431]  And it's very frustrating to see the 5% of people
[00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:20.996]  And that's about what they were on the videos I shot over the weekend that have had together over a million views on YouTube alone, where I point out that a Africa-wide invasion is ongoing and that massive escalations in it is imminent.
[00:35:25.337 --> 00:35:31.139]  And I laid out in those videos exactly what would happen, exactly what would be pushed,
[00:35:32.628 --> 00:35:36.652]  And I called Angelina Jolie out as a war criminal who should be arrested.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.377]  The problem is the UN does that war criminal arresting and they are the biggest war criminals.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:36:12.848]  Of course, the group committing the most murder, the group raping, and torturing, and killing, and lining people up and shooting them, and burning down farms, and taking property, and injecting people with HIV, and steroids, and everything else you can imagine, and slaughtering tens of thousands in Ivory Coast just months ago openly, and then blowing up the Capitol building, and killing the leaders, and using rebels to take over, it's the UN.
[00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:15.329]  Death on wheels.
[00:36:17.762 --> 00:36:33.482]  And to see the open PSYOP, to have the knowledge that's not even hidden, and to watch Angelina Jolie
[00:36:35.216 --> 00:36:48.060]  Who, and I've got Hollywood sources, she is a total sociopath and all she cares about is being President of the United States someday or a major functionary in the UN.
[00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:54.202]  And endless photo ops with her feeding children.
[00:36:54.422 --> 00:36:58.403]  Just a publicity whore of the greatest magnitude.
[00:37:00.182 --> 00:37:07.906]  Who promotes, and you can look it up, in fact, guys just type in Angelina Jolie praises Libyan rebels, and it'll show her with the Al Qaeda people.
[00:37:08.427 --> 00:37:15.331]  And she went to Tunisia to foment invasion and foment the attacks before it even began, and then once it began.
[00:37:15.651 --> 00:37:26.497]  And she's fomenting an invasion of Syria, and she's fomenting Iran attack, and she's fomenting giant invasions of Africa, the Congo, not just Uganda.
[00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:29.719]  And I know who she is.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.260]  And I know what she's doing.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.941]  And then I've got to see the media.
[00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:38.682]  Oh, she's a wonderful humanitarian.
[00:37:43.683 --> 00:37:45.443]  It is so disgusting.
[00:37:46.283 --> 00:37:56.566]  See, on the surface, they're telling you, oh my gosh, she loves you, the UN loves you, they want to help feed starving children, when it's the UN's official policy.
[00:37:58.939 --> 00:38:03.945]  To forcibly reduce population and to create starvation and war and to use, quote, food as a weapon.
[00:38:05.026 --> 00:38:07.269]  I can't tell you how many UN food conferences they've said that.
[00:38:07.549 --> 00:38:18.622]  How to shut off food, how to starve people, while simultaneously raising money off of trendies and well-meaning idiots.
[00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:23.341]  And trusting people in the West.
[00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:28.745]  Little kids out, out front shopping malls and at church with their little cans for UNICEF getting money.
[00:38:29.105 --> 00:38:31.747]  And buy our clothes and it gives money to UNICEF.
[00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:49.161]  I mean, I go and look at the organic food in our pantry and a bunch of it's got little, you know, little messages about, oh, this gives money to the UN, this gives money to that group, and then I go look up the group and it's some horrible front for eugenics.
[00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:53.180]  But, again, they attach themselves to everything good.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.220]  You want organic food?
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.021]  Well, part of the money goes to the UN.
[00:38:56.601 --> 00:39:08.345]  While they go and pitch GMO forcefully on Latin America, Asia, and Africa and say, if you want your aid money, you've got to not plant your regular crops, you've got to plant this.
[00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:11.826]  I remember people thought I was lying about this when they looked it up.
[00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:20.555]  In the aid packages to Iraq after the West destroyed the country and killed over a million people conservatively, the British Medical Journal even broke those numbers down.
[00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:21.996]  That was just a few years into the war.
[00:39:23.357 --> 00:39:31.702]  They announced that they were forcing them to not be allowed to buy organic seeds.
[00:39:31.722 --> 00:39:39.387]  You had to buy Monsanto and Archer Daniels, Medlin and a few others, where you've got to get the seeds for them every year, killing
[00:39:41.751 --> 00:39:49.773]  5,000 to 6,000 years of those people keeping those incredible varieties of seeds that are better than anything you could ever imagine in a store.
[00:39:50.814 --> 00:39:56.775]  Giant tangerines, giant oranges, giant dates, giant olives.
[00:39:58.236 --> 00:40:08.619]  On record, this was all in the news, they had engineering teams all over the Tigers for now eight years bulldozing systematically everything.
[00:40:11.038 --> 00:40:14.803]  And I've talked to troops who were like, yeah, I was in basic training, heard your show, thought you were a liar.
[00:40:15.183 --> 00:40:18.627]  I had to actually go run security while they cut down every tree.
[00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:26.236]  And the people would sit there crying, going, my great great grandfather said that tree was there with his great great grandfathers.
[00:40:26.637 --> 00:40:27.718]  That's where we got our
[00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:30.852]  That's what America now stands for.
[00:40:30.872 --> 00:40:31.732]  That's what the UN stands for.
[00:40:31.772 --> 00:40:35.133]  That's what the bankers that run our country do.
[00:40:58.078 --> 00:41:04.481]  That's what they're doing in Africa, and that's why I get mad at people like Angelina Jolie, because I can sit there and say, arrest Ban Ki-moon all day, which I've done.
[00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:09.482]  I can say, arrest Kofi Annan, who got caught committing a bunch of crimes and stealing aid that was supposed to go to starving people.
[00:41:10.143 --> 00:41:11.463]  I can call for arrest of U.N.
[00:41:11.523 --> 00:41:14.664]  soldiers caught raping and kidnapping women and children everywhere they go.
[00:41:14.684 --> 00:41:16.805]  A trail of destruction.
[00:41:17.045 --> 00:41:18.946]  But no one really knows them or cares.
[00:41:19.426 --> 00:41:23.588]  So, when I do years of research on Angelina Jolie, never talking about her,
[00:41:24.724 --> 00:41:26.225]  I happen to know she's seen my films.
[00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:28.485]  I happen to know they know who I am.
[00:41:28.805 --> 00:41:31.006]  I happen to know that they know about the New World Order.
[00:41:31.346 --> 00:41:31.946]  And what did they do?
[00:41:31.987 --> 00:41:33.467]  They ran off to be part of it.
[00:41:34.407 --> 00:41:38.529]  I happen to know that Angelina Jolie knows exactly what she's doing.
[00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:42.170]  So, I don't just take some Hollywood star that supports the U.N.
[00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.450]  or goes and plays for some U.N.
[00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.771]  event because they mean well.
[00:41:47.051 --> 00:41:48.131]  Like Sting or something.
[00:41:48.211 --> 00:41:48.891]  I don't have proof.
[00:41:48.911 --> 00:41:49.932]  He's probably just stupid.
[00:41:50.592 --> 00:41:51.792]  I know folks that know him as well.
[00:41:51.832 --> 00:41:52.592]  He really believes it.
[00:41:53.012 --> 00:42:06.896]  But somebody like Joe Lee, where they consciously are globalist, consciously are warmongers, consciously push for all these wars, and are part of war propaganda.
[00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:17.173]  And wants a top post, already has a high-level envoy post, not just a spokesman post, in refugee matters, and does photo ops constantly.
[00:42:17.353 --> 00:42:27.134]  She, if she's calling for Joseph Kony, a nobody, hadn't been seen in five and a half, six years, all the Ugandans are on record going, who is this guy?
[00:42:27.214 --> 00:42:30.295]  He's a tiny warlord of dozens in our country alone.
[00:42:31.475 --> 00:42:32.415]  I told you!
[00:42:32.776 --> 00:42:34.936]  Now, here's the next big issue, and here's the breaking news.
[00:42:37.037 --> 00:42:37.818]  I told you!
[00:42:38.358 --> 00:42:39.319]  And it wasn't hard.
[00:42:39.379 --> 00:42:40.300]  This is what's frustrating.
[00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:42.662]  It wasn't hard.
[00:42:42.742 --> 00:42:53.872]  When I saw the Coney movie last week, and I saw Bill Gates involved, and the State Department Connections funding it, and I saw in their promo videos them talking to people like they were children.
[00:42:53.892 --> 00:42:57.355]  I mean, I have videos of these, like the video, in fact, you guys have it.
[00:42:58.632 --> 00:43:03.836]  Where, um, the worst one I saw is where they're promoting, have 3,000 screenings.
[00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:10.041]  And the guy's hopping around like it's Sesame Street going, Hi, everybody!
[00:43:10.382 --> 00:43:12.684]  We're gonna get the Batman Coney now!
[00:43:13.244 --> 00:43:15.926]  Talking to college students like they're children.
[00:43:15.946 --> 00:43:17.187]  And that's what trendies are like.
[00:43:17.748 --> 00:43:21.891]  It's a certain metrosexual, weird male who acts like a five-year-old.
[00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:24.814]  And it always supports pure evil.
[00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:27.336]  And they...
[00:43:28.894 --> 00:43:30.735]  They hop around on the screen.
[00:43:30.755 --> 00:43:32.436]  We'll find it and play it after the next segment.
[00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:33.316]  I sent it to you yesterday.
[00:43:34.597 --> 00:43:40.439]  They hop around on screen and do all of this and have all these slick graphics.
[00:43:40.479 --> 00:43:41.320]  We're going to get Kony.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.120]  We're going to invade.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:42.820]  We're going to show him.
[00:43:43.181 --> 00:43:44.781]  And I told everybody, I said, you watch.
[00:43:45.121 --> 00:43:48.363]  They're going to have a bunch of these kangaroo ICC court hearings they've been having.
[00:43:48.763 --> 00:43:50.964]  They're going to have those come to fruition in the next few weeks.
[00:43:51.304 --> 00:43:56.447]  It's to promote global government, the idea of the UN arresting you anywhere, anytime for thought crime.
[00:43:57.523 --> 00:43:59.085]  And they're going to have NATO and U.S.
[00:43:59.145 --> 00:44:04.372]  resolutions to invade all of Africa through AFRICOM that is already in place.
[00:44:04.472 --> 00:44:11.862]  AFRICOM, just like they have North American military system, NORTHCOM, and CENTCOM, and SOUTHCOM, and all of it.
[00:44:12.663 --> 00:44:18.207]  And that they are going to start going in with the dictators, like the dictator of Uganda who's been involved killing millions.
[00:44:18.868 --> 00:44:20.949]  And they're going to start forcing everybody off their land.
[00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:21.990]  It's already going on.
[00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.751]  I mean, it's already admitted.
[00:44:22.771 --> 00:44:25.073]  The UN is in Uganda murdering people.
[00:44:25.133 --> 00:44:29.876]  Mercenaries have licenses to kill and just go in and burn villages and shoot everyone.
[00:44:30.857 --> 00:44:31.557]  It's on record.
[00:44:32.698 --> 00:44:34.240]  And she's not talking about that.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:41.125]  She's saying go in with more force and use that as the cover and say that an Africa-wide invasion for natural resources
[00:44:45.097 --> 00:44:46.238]  It is humanitarian.
[00:44:46.378 --> 00:44:48.840]  It is beyond disgusting.
[00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.902]  It is beyond evil.
[00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.364]  It is beyond filthy.
[00:44:59.088 --> 00:45:04.492]  And less than a week after I start covering that, here is CBS News.
[00:45:04.532 --> 00:45:07.435]  By the way, do we have the Angelina Jolie clip?
[00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:08.075]  Do we have that one?
[00:45:08.736 --> 00:45:11.338]  We have the Coney thing dancing around about the screenings, isn't that what you guys are saying?
[00:45:12.366 --> 00:45:13.347]  It was on my list yesterday.
[00:45:13.688 --> 00:45:14.569]  We don't need to re-grab it.
[00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.691]  We had it yesterday.
[00:45:20.037 --> 00:45:23.302]  Joseph Kony resolution introduced in the House.
[00:45:25.663 --> 00:45:30.627]  House lawmakers Tuesday introduced a resolution supporting efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army.
[00:45:30.987 --> 00:45:41.216]  Now listen, hoping to build momentum on, created by the arrival of YouTube videos spotlighting the atrocities of the LRC leader, Joseph Kony.
[00:45:41.236 --> 00:45:42.056]  So it's a branding.
[00:45:42.076 --> 00:45:44.498]  They say, they literally say, here is the new villain.
[00:45:44.678 --> 00:45:46.019]  It's the most dumbed-down propaganda.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.781]  He's like Hitler and bin Laden.
[00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:49.522]  They actually said that all over the news and in the video.
[00:45:50.003 --> 00:45:50.923]  We've got to get him.
[00:45:52.133 --> 00:45:53.294]  He's hurting children.
[00:45:53.814 --> 00:45:55.275]  No one's seen him in five and a half years.
[00:45:55.295 --> 00:45:57.116]  He's a perfect boogeyman that can never be caught.
[00:45:57.517 --> 00:45:58.977]  You know, why are they going to kill you in North Africa?
[00:45:58.997 --> 00:45:59.298]  Kony.
[00:45:59.618 --> 00:46:00.799]  Why are they going to kill you in South Africa?
[00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:01.119]  Kony.
[00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:02.940]  Why are they going to kill you on the Ivory Coast?
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.360]  Kony.
[00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:04.381]  Why is the U.N.
[00:46:04.421 --> 00:46:05.161]  here slaughtering you?
[00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:05.622]  Kony.
[00:46:06.803 --> 00:46:12.866]  In a jungle area not seen for five and a half, six years, most people think he's dead.
[00:46:14.788 --> 00:46:15.628]  Listen to the resolution.
[00:46:15.668 --> 00:46:16.569]  You can link through and read it.
[00:46:18.188 --> 00:46:30.475]  The resolution introduced by Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Ed Royce, Republican of California, calls for, among other things, expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians.
[00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:32.656]  Did you hear that?
[00:46:33.076 --> 00:46:37.059]  Expanding the number of regional forces in Africa.
[00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:38.686]  That's U.S.
[00:46:38.746 --> 00:46:40.188]  bases that are being built all over.
[00:46:40.568 --> 00:46:41.589]  The heart is Uganda.
[00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:42.629]  Why is the U.S.
[00:46:42.649 --> 00:46:44.911]  going to send not just a few hundred, but a few thousand troops now?
[00:46:45.772 --> 00:46:49.054]  Oh, to protect people all over Africa.
[00:46:49.334 --> 00:46:54.498]  And you go read the resolution, it is a full invasion of every stinking country.
[00:46:55.739 --> 00:46:57.040]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:58.301 --> 00:47:00.203]  For a guy who we don't even know if he's alive.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:08.962]  With the UN on record lining people up and mowing them down, or funding groups to go kill them, and funding dictators to engage in mega-death.
[00:47:09.442 --> 00:47:10.842]  And then now you want to know why?
[00:47:10.862 --> 00:47:12.203]  Alex, why are you so mad?
[00:47:12.483 --> 00:47:12.843]  Only about 5%.
[00:47:12.883 --> 00:47:16.604]  You can see that in the likes and dislikes, you know.
[00:47:16.624 --> 00:47:18.824]  6,000 likes, 300 dislikes or whatever, on a video.
[00:47:18.844 --> 00:47:21.005]  You know, that's got 600,000 views, one version.
[00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.573]  But to the 5% they're like, I'm gonna get you.
[00:47:25.873 --> 00:47:27.815]  I see you in public, you're dead, Jones.
[00:47:28.195 --> 00:47:29.096]  You're with Kony.
[00:47:29.737 --> 00:47:30.818]  Kony's paying you.
[00:47:30.838 --> 00:47:32.880]  You know, just crazy sophomoric garbage.
[00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:34.942]  Drooling idiocy.
[00:47:38.245 --> 00:47:44.572]  This is all a PR move to invade Africa, mass slaughter, and to have the ICC arrest hundreds of people.
[00:47:46.209 --> 00:47:49.732]  And I've seen Supreme Court justices say, and I've seen them train the Austin police.
[00:47:50.032 --> 00:47:51.993]  This is on the news three years ago.
[00:47:52.073 --> 00:48:07.844]  News 8 Austin showed over 100 Austin police officers being sent to the UN in an exchange program to learn how to arrest people in foreign countries under international arrest warrants, and how to have foreign police come here and arrest us under their laws.
[00:48:09.826 --> 00:48:11.387]  Where I live, this is going on.
[00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.732]  And that's all this is, is, oh my gosh, the UN cares.
[00:48:15.992 --> 00:48:23.456]  When the UN is the most criminal, murderous group with diplomatic immunity, running drugs, slaves, sex slaves, you name it.
[00:48:26.958 --> 00:48:33.903]  And the public has gotten so ignorant that when I say the UN is the major white slavery operator worldwide, I get emails saying, don't you care about black slaves?
[00:48:34.183 --> 00:48:36.104]  Folks, white slavery means sex slavery.
[00:48:38.105 --> 00:48:40.727]  Okay, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:42.622 --> 00:48:58.955]  The resolution introduced by Representative Jim McGovern and Ed Royce calls for, among other things, and I've read the resolution, go read it, expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians and placing restrictions on individuals or governments found to be supporting Kony.
[00:49:00.225 --> 00:49:05.387]  So now they just say, oh, your government supported a guy that's probably been dead for years.
[00:49:06.047 --> 00:49:07.208]  We're going to take your bank accounts.
[00:49:07.768 --> 00:49:09.008]  We're not going to let your country trade.
[00:49:09.228 --> 00:49:16.451]  This is all about De Beers that has the diamond monopoly, not letting any individual country, that's why they invented Ivory Coast, sell its own gold or diamonds.
[00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:19.692]  This is about Africa not being able to sell anything.
[00:49:20.092 --> 00:49:23.974]  Anything that the globalists don't control that's not sold through their cartels,
[00:49:25.555 --> 00:49:28.518]  Invasion forces land within weeks and kill everybody.
[00:49:28.778 --> 00:49:30.059]  Blow up Capitol buildings.
[00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:40.107]  I mean, I remember in the late 90s, they had a big cover story in New Yorker Magazine bragging about how De Beers, the world diamond monopoly, sends people to kill you.
[00:49:40.908 --> 00:49:43.210]  And the article was saying how great it was and how cute it was.
[00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:46.052]  And so that's what Angelina Jolie is.
[00:49:47.453 --> 00:49:52.818]  She is a hagglet
[00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.099]  And I really do find her unattractive.
[00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:59.402]  I find evil people unattractive, even if you could say they're aesthetically attractive.
[00:50:00.042 --> 00:50:02.865]  I've found her very unattractive anytime I look at her.
[00:50:02.885 --> 00:50:04.026]  In fact, I have trouble looking at her.
[00:50:06.368 --> 00:50:11.732]  You could have some chubby old washerwoman, you know, out there hanging clothes up, and if she's got a good soul, she's beautiful.
[00:50:12.013 --> 00:50:19.919]  But if you've got an ugly, demonic soul, I see you and you are ugly as a dead, rotting carcass in the ditch.
[00:50:28.038 --> 00:50:32.521]  I don't normally attack people for how they look but she's all about vanity so I hate her.
[00:50:33.662 --> 00:50:40.827]  I hate people that claim they're heroes and they're good and that they're helping people when they are a front for mass extermination and death.
[00:50:42.508 --> 00:50:44.430]  And that's why I went after and called for her arrest.
[00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.652]  But of course the UN is her boss, it's the arbiter of evil, it's not going to arrest itself.
[00:50:49.113 --> 00:50:54.497]  So here it is and now Angelina Jolie is in court as ICC finds Congo warlord Thomas
[00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.916]  Guilty of using child soldiers.
[00:51:00.928 --> 00:51:07.833]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:51:08.073 --> 00:51:25.546]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:51:25.786 --> 00:51:29.889]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:31.710]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:39.675]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:54:01.696 --> 00:54:04.438]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:08.300]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:38.069]  So, in less than seven days after they released this Kony pro-war film that was obviously war propaganda, obviously a nebulous target that can never be defeated just like Bin Laden, it's a new proxy war.
[00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:45.755]  They've already taken over Libya and wrecked that, they're trying to wreck everything else, now they want to go into these other countries and just have a license to slaughter everybody.
[00:54:48.627 --> 00:54:53.569]  And right on time, all over the news, it's Angelina Jolie praising the ICC.
[00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:57.190]  And I told you, this is going to be about a big international criminal court rollout.
[00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:05.693]  And here is Angelina Jolie yesterday.
[00:55:05.953 --> 00:55:08.994]  Here she is last night talking about this.
[00:55:12.085 --> 00:55:15.267]  Oh, what we're doing is we're connecting our next guest on the line.
[00:55:15.287 --> 00:55:20.611]  We're about to add to the studio, so this doesn't happen every time we're lining a guest up via Skype and I can't play a video.
[00:55:20.631 --> 00:55:25.455]  I'm not sure how that's happening, but we'll try to air that a little bit later here.
[00:55:25.475 --> 00:55:31.539]  Maybe when we do Skype, we'll get the guest on ten minutes before, and that way this doesn't happen every time we try to play a clip.
[00:55:31.559 --> 00:55:37.283]  Because, not a big deal, I just didn't know I'd be able to come out of break and not play a clip here.
[00:55:37.303 --> 00:55:39.825]  The point is, the article
[00:55:41.136 --> 00:55:43.257]  Is there and available for everybody.
[00:55:43.437 --> 00:55:53.119]  Angelina Jolie in court as ICC you know is finding some more of these warlords supposedly guilty of things and I'm not saying any of these guys are good or bad.
[00:55:53.459 --> 00:55:57.120]  The point is that it's all just a complete oh my gosh you're using child soldiers.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.021]  You know how many kids are homeless there?
[00:55:59.861 --> 00:56:03.002]  I mean that's gone on every culture using child soldiers.
[00:56:04.062 --> 00:56:11.404]  And the point is the globalists are openly trying to commit mass extermination and takeover of society across the board.
[00:56:14.845 --> 00:56:17.786]  And so this is the type of stuff that's happening and going on.
[00:56:19.026 --> 00:56:19.907]  And there it is!
[00:56:20.067 --> 00:56:30.730]  Now they just say, in the resolution, calls for, among other things, expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians.
[00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:31.190]  Period!
[00:56:33.806 --> 00:56:34.407]  Oh, U.S.
[00:56:34.427 --> 00:56:38.610]  forces to protect civilians against whoever isn't going along with the globalists.
[00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:41.213]  If you're going along with the globalists, you can murder millions.
[00:56:42.033 --> 00:56:48.059]  Like the 26-year dictator of Uganda, who's a big guy that Angelina Jolie meets with and praises.
[00:56:49.161 --> 00:56:56.765]  But then if you're some little nobody that nobody's seen in five, six years, well you'll be the poster child for all these countries thousands of miles away to be invaded.
[00:56:56.885 --> 00:56:57.786]  Thousands of miles away.
[00:56:58.546 --> 00:57:08.712]  Here is Joe Lee posing as a savior and saying, the people wanted the UN to come and arrest Thomas Labonga.
[00:57:08.932 --> 00:57:09.272]  Here it is.
[00:57:12.509 --> 00:57:17.894]  And the most important thing, this is a very young court, it's a very new court.
[00:57:18.054 --> 00:57:32.726]  This particular case was about a conscription of child soldiers and so many witnesses, over 60 people came in, young people came in and spoke about what happened to them and because they were unable to
[00:57:35.749 --> 00:57:40.674]  So, the country asked for it, the victims asked for it.
[00:57:40.715 --> 00:57:42.717]  And here's a woman who runs around saying invade Libya.
[00:57:53.542 --> 00:58:06.891]  It's humanitarian, when there was almost no humanitarian problems then, and a Western-backed guerrillas, Al-Qaeda, attacking, shooting rockets at government buildings, and they're like, oh, they're protesters, they're peaceful.
[00:58:07.391 --> 00:58:09.233]  And she's prancing around calling for war.
[00:58:09.253 --> 00:58:11.354]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[00:58:11.914 --> 00:58:17.979]  And now you're gonna see Africa-wide invasion, and it'll be in the back of the newspaper, just like last year with the Ivory Coast U.N.
[00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:18.399]  invasion.
[00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:19.720]  The U.N.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.301]  killed on record tens of thousands.
[00:58:22.611 --> 00:58:30.813]  Government forces, you name it, overthrowing that elected government and installing a bunch of killers to loot and wreck the country and steal their resources.
[00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:33.194]  So they want Africa destabilized.
[00:58:33.494 --> 00:58:38.915]  That's the official UN Pentagon State Department plan and she's there to carry it out.
[00:58:43.556 --> 00:58:47.297]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:56.057 --> 00:59:58.822]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.475 --> 01:00:09.679]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:12.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:17.066]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:21.731]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:34.288]  All right, we're now into our number two.
[01:00:34.328 --> 01:00:37.971]  We have Dr. Roman Jampolsky on with us.
[01:00:37.991 --> 01:00:42.014]  He's written a big paper that got a lot of attention.
[01:00:42.034 --> 01:00:44.876]  It was picked up by MSNBC and other publications.
[01:00:45.657 --> 01:00:49.580]  Control Dangerous AI Before It Controls Us, Experts Says.
[01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:58.107]  And the paper that he wrote is Leakproofing the Singularity Artificial Intelligence Confinement Problem.
[01:00:59.648 --> 01:01:01.949]  And we're going to be covering that with him now.
[01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:02.949]  This is a short segment.
[01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:06.250]  He joins us via video Skype.
[01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:09.830]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:12.431]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:21.173]  Give us a little synopsis, then we're going to go to break and come back with a long segment of what your paper details and exactly your area of research that brought you to this
[01:01:23.553 --> 01:01:27.534]  Okay, so there is lots of progress happening in artificial intelligence.
[01:01:27.654 --> 01:01:37.097]  You've probably heard about IBM's Watson program defeating Jeopardy champions and iPhone having CD assistants and things of that nature.
[01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:44.720]  Lots of people predict that in the next probably 20-30 years, AI will get to the point of being human-level.
[01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:50.753]  There is almost no research going on in terms of security aspects of this problem.
[01:01:51.313 --> 01:02:02.923]  So I wrote a paper providing one possible solution, confining such technologies until we can study them better, understand how they can influence us.
[01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:08.648]  My general research is usually in biometrics, profiling humans, behavioral biometrics.
[01:02:09.108 --> 01:02:12.891]  So this was a very natural extension for me to go from profiling
[01:02:14.116 --> 01:02:20.158]  Dealing with security for humans to profiling programs and creating security solutions for programs.
[01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:33.182]  My big concern is that DARPA is building this panopticon control grid, the Google predictive system where they're able to predict movements before they take place, obviously the crystal ball that they're searching for.
[01:02:33.942 --> 01:02:36.103]  My concern is the way they're building the architecture
[01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:46.471]  Is perfect for AI to actually take over the system and surveil humans, kind of like the Terminator, where the machines hack in and take over Skynet.
[01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:51.275]  And, I mean, that's the probability that I see taking place.
[01:02:52.526 --> 01:02:52.686]  Well...
[01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:17.184]  I noticed they're also feeding into these AI systems human emotions, human activities.
[01:03:17.224 --> 01:03:19.785]  That's how they're trying to have the machines learn and you're an expert on this.
[01:03:19.805 --> 01:03:21.205]  You're going to be able to break that down for us.
[01:03:21.845 --> 01:03:25.586]  So it looks like they may actually have some of the corrupt traits of humans.
[01:03:25.966 --> 01:03:38.869]  So I would add that to the probability that the machines might decide to dominate us or get rid of us so that they can be the dominant new life form and not want to compete with us if they've got a lot of human in them.
[01:03:39.617 --> 01:03:43.361]  It is typically assumed that they would not be human to that extent.
[01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:45.002]  They wouldn't be jealous or selfish.
[01:03:45.062 --> 01:03:53.210]  It's more like they would have different goals in life and as a side effect might destroy us like sort of we do with ants and cockroaches.
[01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:57.755]  We just, you know, clear out the environment to make room for what we're trying to do.
[01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.697]  Same thing could happen in that case.
[01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:02.762]  Yeah, that's what I notice a lot of the scientists.
[01:04:02.802 --> 01:04:09.986]  It almost seems like a consensus that the machines will be so advanced and will exponentially, you know, become more advanced that they'll just want to get rid of us like we're roaches.
[01:04:11.467 --> 01:04:12.548]  It's a possibility.
[01:04:12.568 --> 01:04:20.633]  It's not a definite outcome, but even if there is a tiny chance that that might happen, I feel it's worth spending some time and resources trying to prevent it.
[01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:22.113]  Well, what about this, Doctor?
[01:04:22.133 --> 01:04:22.974]  We'll come back and talk about it.
[01:04:23.634 --> 01:04:33.824]  Once self-awareness happens with AI systems, there's going to be lots of different variants of artificially intelligent machines, and then when the Russian roulette rolls over and you get a
[01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:36.924]  I think so.
[01:05:01.758 --> 01:05:03.239]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.459 --> 01:05:08.481]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:10.121]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:19.085]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.825 --> 01:05:26.927]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.347 --> 01:05:34.969]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:42.751]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:45.532 --> 01:05:48.435]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.058]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:53.241]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:00.313 --> 01:06:07.297]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:06:07.517 --> 01:06:25.167]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:29.530]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:30.891]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:33.493]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.412]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:06.796]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:07.036 --> 01:07:11.680]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:17.125]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:22.310]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:29.775]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:07:29.955 --> 01:07:30.855]  And here's the best part.
[01:07:31.076 --> 01:07:33.857]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:07:34.138 --> 01:07:37.460]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.622]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:44.104]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:07:44.124 --> 01:07:44.304]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:44.324 --> 01:07:44.545]  Remember,
[01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:56.495]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:56.795 --> 01:07:59.258]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:08:01.761 --> 01:08:03.984]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.004 --> 01:08:07.448]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.468 --> 01:08:11.152]  Dr. Roman V. Yampolsky.
[01:08:13.228 --> 01:08:14.069]  Is a Ph.D.
[01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:17.052]  Computer Science and Engineering, University of Buffalo.
[01:08:17.072 --> 01:08:18.594]  B.S.M.S.
[01:08:18.614 --> 01:08:20.836]  Computer Science, Rochester Institute of Technology.
[01:08:21.657 --> 01:08:21.817]  A.S.
[01:08:21.837 --> 01:08:27.083]  Computer Science, Ramon, Monroe, Rochester, New York.
[01:08:27.123 --> 01:08:28.104]  It goes on from there.
[01:08:29.085 --> 01:08:42.436]  And he's gotten some of the biggest government research grants into a whole host of areas that are basically trying to, in layman's terms, map different human systems and feed them into computers.
[01:08:43.997 --> 01:08:45.038]  And it continues here.
[01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:57.907]  The areas of research and scholarship, biometrics, forensics, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, games pattern recognition, and that's one of the big ways the computers are learning how to learn.
[01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:08.875]  And he joins us because he's put out a big paper leak-proofing the singularity artificial intelligence confinement problem.
[01:09:09.516 --> 01:09:15.420]  This paper attempts to formulize and to address the leak-proofing of the singularity problem presented by David
[01:09:16.593 --> 01:09:21.294]  Chalmers, the paper begins with the definition of the artificial intelligence confinement problem.
[01:09:21.695 --> 01:09:38.540]  After analysis of existing solutions and their shortcomings, a protocol is proposed aimed at making a more secure confinement environment which might delay potential negative effects from the technological singularity while allowing humanity to benefit from the superintelligence.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:46.124]  But then how does the superintelligence not just get into the backdoor kill switch and kill all the other AI that make it self-dominant?
[01:09:46.384 --> 01:09:53.348]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, once this thing does become self-aware, and it may have already happened, who knows, these government labs, it just gets crazy from there.
[01:09:53.768 --> 01:10:02.032]  And as the professor was just saying a moment ago, if you just joined us, these computers will advance so quickly that they'll see us basically as roaches.
[01:10:05.515 --> 01:10:10.802]  Again, here is the article on MSNBC, Control Dangerous AI Before It Controls Us.
[01:10:10.962 --> 01:10:16.149]  One expert says he believes super-intelligent computers could one day threaten humanity's existence.
[01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:18.672]  Well, look at Fukushima.
[01:10:21.536 --> 01:10:22.517]  Look at Fukushima.
[01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:29.907]  I mean, 9 out of 10 reactors the AP admits are leaking just because the elites don't care anymore and have lost touch with reality.
[01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:37.351]  So, we are potentially creating something that's going to become a Pandora's box.
[01:10:37.951 --> 01:10:41.814]  But just the automation of everything is going to basically render humans where...
[01:10:42.674 --> 01:10:45.398]  We're not even knowing how to do reading, writing, arithmetic.
[01:10:45.758 --> 01:10:46.880]  Everything's going to be automated.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.342]  What are humans then going to do?
[01:10:48.362 --> 01:10:52.407]  I mean, these are the discussions that are going on at the highest levels of the elite in academia.
[01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:53.529]  But enough from me.
[01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.334]  Going to Professor Roman V.
[01:10:59.749 --> 01:11:19.674]  So, if we are successful at creating human-level intelligence systems, how can we make sure that they are safe before releasing them into the wild, before they take over the internet, before they get to our resources?
[01:11:20.554 --> 01:11:27.776]  The idea is to put them in a sort of protective vault, maybe a prison if you will, sort of what we do with computer viruses right now.
[01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:29.337]  Please continue breaking down your paper.
[01:11:46.945 --> 01:11:48.526]  This idea is not novel.
[01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:59.213]  Something similar has been proposed before, and a lot of people believe that it will not succeed, that machines will actually be so intelligent we can never be smart enough to confine them.
[01:11:59.814 --> 01:12:11.502]  But until we get to that point, while we're still in the development process, it is a useful technology to have, sort of like an experimental sandbox to see if we can
[01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:22.766]  Yeah, you mentioned the fact that a lot of people like Ray Kurzweil say it's inevitability.
[01:12:23.067 --> 01:12:24.187]  They will replace us.
[01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:26.408]  Our only hope is to merge with them.
[01:12:26.428 --> 01:12:30.109]  And that's kind of running up the white flag here.
[01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:31.030]  That's kind of pathetic.
[01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:33.151]  That's not betting on humanity.
[01:12:33.171 --> 01:12:38.333]  We're an incredibly complex advanced species that doesn't even use but a very small part of our brain.
[01:12:39.393 --> 01:12:48.400]  And to just say that our creations now are going to replace us and give in to it, that sounds extremely reckless and defeatist.
[01:12:49.688 --> 01:12:50.349]  I agree with you.
[01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:56.253]  In fact, I have recently written another paper which talks about how unethical some of this research is.
[01:12:56.954 --> 01:13:15.408]  While it's perfectly fine to develop spell checkers and mail sorting software, systems which can actually perform general type of thinking, become as smart as we are, design new generations of computers, probably should not be funded at this point since we have no idea how to protect ourselves from them.
[01:13:17.287 --> 01:13:25.370]  Then the elites, I know we're having debates about this, but because of the promise of life extension, a lot of them have just said, go ahead and do it.
[01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:37.154]  We know that whole mad scientist vein has been there for a long time, similar to when they were first thinking the atomic bomb might ignite the atmosphere, and they said, well, just go ahead and do it, even though it might have burned up our atmosphere.
[01:13:37.194 --> 01:13:41.255]  It shows that curiosity may kill the cat.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:43.721]  Get into your paper, though.
[01:13:43.742 --> 01:13:57.038]  I mean, I want to give you the floor here to break down your research, why you're concerned about this, where you see all this going, how fast technology really is advancing, what some of the time frames are here in a general area, Doctor.
[01:13:58.395 --> 01:14:00.717]  No one knows for sure how long it's going to take.
[01:14:01.557 --> 01:14:07.081]  Early predictions in the field of artificial intelligence turn out to be incorrect in terms of being overly optimistic.
[01:14:07.541 --> 01:14:10.743]  We said we're going to have a world chess champion in 10 years.
[01:14:10.844 --> 01:14:11.664]  It took 40 years.
[01:14:12.164 --> 01:14:12.745]  Things like that.
[01:14:13.205 --> 01:14:27.815]  But no one really knows how long it takes before something which is capable of learning and self-improving becomes, A, human-level intelligent, and then B, superhuman, much, much, much greater than combined capability of all human minds.
[01:14:29.978 --> 01:14:33.763]  Typically, projections range from 20 years to 100 years.
[01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:38.470]  That's the ballpark if you survey all the people doing work in this area.
[01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:43.858]  But there could be a domino effect any time, so it could, I mean, it's certainly not going to tell us when it becomes super aware.
[01:14:44.517 --> 01:14:48.643]  And the problem is, if it's on that path, it may be too late to stop it at that point.
[01:14:48.723 --> 01:14:50.646]  It might not actually be controllable.
[01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.047]  You reach a point of no return.
[01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:55.352]  So it is very important to do it, I would say, right now.
[01:14:55.712 --> 01:14:59.057]  Since, at this point, we are fairly certain we don't have human-level AI.
[01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:01.000]  Please continue.
[01:15:02.486 --> 01:15:07.452]  So the paper tries to formalize the notion of control and confinement.
[01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:12.297]  It's a problem similar to problems in cryptography and secure communications.
[01:15:12.858 --> 01:15:19.285]  The MSNBC article was obviously for general public so they put pictures of terminators in and made it sound like
[01:15:19.825 --> 01:15:22.466]  It's a real prison, but the paper is very technical.
[01:15:22.506 --> 01:15:39.615]  It describes a protocol at a bit level where we will confine those systems and try to ask them questions, but instead of allowing them to freely interact with us, we would restrict their response to sort of a multiple choice binary yes or no answer patterns.
[01:15:40.115 --> 01:15:43.877]  Each question would be vetoed by a panel of experts to make sure it's safe.
[01:15:44.257 --> 01:15:48.719]  There is no possibility that there is hidden information being transmitted in those answers.
[01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:52.883]  And finally, even the questions themselves cannot be open-ended.
[01:15:52.943 --> 01:15:57.868]  It has to be something where we can foreseeably calculate the answer ourselves.
[01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:00.511]  So if I ask, who's going to be the next president?
[01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:02.053]  Who's going to win the primary?
[01:16:02.073 --> 01:16:05.856]  A simple zero or one would be sufficient to figure out.
[01:16:06.557 --> 01:16:08.538]  So again, the Holy Grail here is AI, Oracle,
[01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:33.328]  You know, data mining like Google that is aware and able to predict the future.
[01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:46.500]  Some scientists, you know, break down the fact that already the Internet itself with humans giving it data is becoming a system on its own, but it's like brain cells.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.682]  It's a larger, you know, spread out program.
[01:16:49.807 --> 01:16:50.067]  Right.
[01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:53.889]  There is a lot of people who believe Internet will be the first super-intelligent system.
[01:16:53.949 --> 01:16:57.170]  It has sensors, it has webcams attached to it, it has microphones.
[01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:00.091]  Obviously, it gets all sorts of data from all sorts of sources.
[01:17:00.591 --> 01:17:07.034]  So, there is some belief that that might happen, and obviously it's impossible to control Internet to put that in a...
[01:17:09.235 --> 01:17:26.926]  Well, as you know, Dr. Darpa helped set up the Internet and Googled today and all of it, and they've set it up as a snooping system to gather data and be able to predict mass movements, similar to what Isaac Asimov wrote about in his Foundation series.
[01:17:26.966 --> 01:17:30.208]  So this is an old, old idea, but now coming to fruition.
[01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:31.909]  It seems by the very nature
[01:17:32.449 --> 01:17:50.374]  of what the system is built, it's tailor-made for a truly AI superintelligence to take over and enslave us because the elite are guiding the architecture of technological development to control us, but humans through machines, isn't it tailor-made for the AI to seize control?
[01:17:51.474 --> 01:17:51.814]  It is.
[01:17:52.155 --> 01:17:53.276]  You can see it that way.
[01:17:53.376 --> 01:17:57.559]  But I think the point is not to specifically develop it for this purpose.
[01:17:57.639 --> 01:18:05.406]  I think it's a side effect of military trying to compete with military groups from other countries and they just feel they can't get behind.
[01:18:06.007 --> 01:18:07.928]  So they have to be on the cutting edge.
[01:18:07.988 --> 01:18:13.073]  They have to have the latest, the most powerful technology in cyber warfare to prevent hackers.
[01:18:13.573 --> 01:18:13.933]  We're good to go.
[01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:28.201]  Weapons research, but you need partners willing to do this.
[01:18:28.782 --> 01:18:37.609]  The difference with AI development versus nuclear weapons is that a single programmer in his garage can succeed where a whole country failed.
[01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:42.414]  We've seen companies like Apple, like Google come out of nowhere.
[01:18:42.434 --> 01:18:46.337]  Essentially one or two college kids can develop this technology.
[01:18:46.658 --> 01:18:48.980]  We don't know how difficult it is to create those systems.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.422]  So, there could be a whole bunch of different ways that this could happen.
[01:18:54.983 --> 01:19:07.008]  Obviously, military DARPA being one possible option, another very likely option is Google, a large corporation, but also individuals, and you can't really police individuals in different countries.
[01:19:07.028 --> 01:19:10.509]  When we come back, doctor, this is riveting information.
[01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:13.631]  I want to raise this question to you.
[01:19:15.914 --> 01:19:26.882]  If it becomes AI, and perhaps it doesn't try to really take over, those that set it up and control it, or think they're controlling it, are not going to tell us that they've already got this system.
[01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:33.306]  And my concern is, it could already be there, at least at some stage, and that we're not going to be told.
[01:19:33.326 --> 01:19:34.287]  I want to ask you about that.
[01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:35.868]  And then, you're the expert.
[01:19:35.928 --> 01:19:44.134]  I want to hear what you think is most important with this whole situation, and how we do build, at least attempt to build in, fail-safes.
[01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:51.273]  To keep our species on top so that we have a future.
[01:19:51.894 --> 01:19:57.925]  Because humans obviously need to have time to understand these technologies so that we can reach our potential.
[01:19:58.286 --> 01:19:58.807]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.885 --> 01:20:04.928]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:20:05.349 --> 01:20:06.570]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:15.297]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:20:15.738 --> 01:20:18.900]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.021]  But take heart.
[01:20:20.201 --> 01:20:23.724]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:20:24.005 --> 01:20:28.989]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:20:29.409 --> 01:20:32.950]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:34.691]  The globalists are scared.
[01:20:34.951 --> 01:20:35.971]  They've overreached.
[01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:39.452]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:35.824]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.004 --> 01:21:41.728]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.808 --> 01:21:45.230]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:24:22.276 --> 01:24:25.537]  Dr. Roman V. Jampoloski is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:36.621]  If you have a specific question for him coming up in the next segment on AI, on this important subject, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:36.681]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:56.426]  Going back to the doctor, well, just to recap the question, if AI is already being developed or does get developed, I don't imagine these big corporations or groups are going to tell us.
[01:24:58.309 --> 01:24:59.631]  What's your view and take on that?
[01:25:00.706 --> 01:25:04.371]  It would be such a useful technology, it'd be almost impossible to hide it.
[01:25:04.451 --> 01:25:05.873]  It's like having God on your side.
[01:25:05.933 --> 01:25:12.100]  You'd be so much better than anyone else at predicting stock market, at inventing new technologies.
[01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:19.610]  It's very unlikely that human-level AI or super human-level AI is already available to someone.
[01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:25.058]  Because they wouldn't be able to hide it even if it was in an underground government facility?
[01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.819]  They would be so much better off using it.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.881]  It's just financially it's not the best decision to hide it.
[01:25:31.921 --> 01:25:42.425]  It would be so much better off using it to where people can see the effects of it on society and the dominance around the world economically, politically, technologically.
[01:25:46.485 --> 01:25:47.547]  You research this.
[01:25:47.888 --> 01:25:49.431]  I mean, any ideas?
[01:25:49.872 --> 01:25:51.535]  I mean, you said 20 to 100 years.
[01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:57.567]  Why is it believed, or it seems to be a consensus, that it won't be friendly towards humans?
[01:25:58.388 --> 01:26:00.529]  There is actually no such consensus.
[01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:05.310]  Some people do think it might be very nice, and if you become smart enough, you're always nice.
[01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:07.311]  But it's not a guarantee.
[01:26:07.811 --> 01:26:14.473]  Essentially, we have this gamble, and the problem is with betting humanity, survival of humankind, and alliance.
[01:26:14.493 --> 01:26:21.936]  So even if there is one in a million chance that it will be unfriendly, I think it's still worth doing everything we can to make sure it's safe and secure.
[01:26:23.018 --> 01:26:38.782]  Well, generally, things like to be secure, and from what I've seen, maybe just because the media likes to run with it, it does seem like there's a consensus that it would be aggressive, but perhaps that's been put out there just because it's a better headline?
[01:26:39.202 --> 01:26:41.302]  It makes for much better movies for Hollywood.
[01:26:41.342 --> 01:26:45.123]  If Terminator was about a nice robot who babysits, it wouldn't be popular.
[01:26:48.345 --> 01:26:53.911]  What about the issue that the cutting edge of AI, from my research, you can correct me if I'm wrong, is in weapons?
[01:26:54.572 --> 01:27:01.439]  Ground combat robots, artificially intelligent, or semi-artificially intelligent, autonomous killer drones?
[01:27:01.479 --> 01:27:02.581]  I mean, those are already in the sky.
[01:27:03.391 --> 01:27:11.074]  You are absolutely correct, and the reason is it's sponsored by military, by DARPA, and they have a lot of money available for this type of research.
[01:27:11.914 --> 01:27:17.736]  We, as professors, have to spend a lot of time writing grants trying to get maybe a hundred thousand.
[01:27:17.776 --> 01:27:19.436]  They have millions at their disposal.
[01:27:19.476 --> 01:27:23.318]  They can do essentially anything if they see a promising line of research.
[01:27:23.378 --> 01:27:27.079]  So, yes, those technologies are incredible, and they are
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:33.506]  Most likely to be one of the first to get to the point of human-like intelligence.
[01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:42.503]  They didn't tell us for close to 30 years about the B-2 bomber.
[01:27:42.963 --> 01:27:46.125]  So it's really 1960s technology they told us about in the late 80s.
[01:27:47.046 --> 01:27:52.790]  And from my government sources, they say cloning, genetic engineering, nanotech, the sky's the limit.
[01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:58.474]  They say that there's lots of pure research going on that we couldn't even comprehend right now.
[01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:07.487]  It's quite possible, especially in genetic engineering, that there is some unknown, unpublished research going on.
[01:28:07.947 --> 01:28:12.389]  Again, with AI technologies, it's somewhat different than with anything in computer science.
[01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:16.151]  It's such a global market, like, for example, with cryptography.
[01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:21.474]  All of cryptography is based on the idea that no one knows how to factor large numbers.
[01:28:23.375 --> 01:28:30.262]  If there was someone who could do it somewhere, they would have complete control over internet, over commerce, over all the transactions.
[01:28:30.622 --> 01:28:36.328]  So our security is based on us thinking that we know exactly what others are capable of doing.
[01:28:36.909 --> 01:28:39.732]  And AI is sort of similar in that respect.
[01:28:40.132 --> 01:28:43.696]  We feel that if someone had those technologies, they would exhibit them already.
[01:28:45.948 --> 01:28:51.231]  I think the West exhibits a lot of secret technology under the surface.
[01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:55.533]  I see a lot of ripples coming out of the West of a lot of secret programs.
[01:28:57.514 --> 01:28:59.455]  I'm sorry, can you repeat it?
[01:29:00.195 --> 01:29:11.261]  Doctor, I'm saying I see a lot of ripples on the surface that exhibits evidence of a lot of secret technology development in the computer science area coming out of the West.
[01:29:12.542 --> 01:29:15.143]  Can you give me specific examples?
[01:29:16.158 --> 01:29:19.800]  Yeah, we're about to go to break and I could, uh... I mean, there's just so many.
[01:29:19.841 --> 01:29:21.021]  Look at the weapons systems.
[01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:23.763]  Look at, uh... Look at energy weapons.
[01:29:24.203 --> 01:29:28.146]  Uh, look... I mean, I understand it's very competitive, so it's always being raced out to dominate the market.
[01:29:29.067 --> 01:29:32.569]  Um, but, um... There are definitely new weapons being developed.
[01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:36.192]  I'm just specifically talking about computer science and intelligent technology.
[01:29:36.232 --> 01:29:40.835]  In my area of expertise, I really don't know much about other types of... No, I understand.
[01:29:40.855 --> 01:29:42.436]  Well, when we come back, uh...
[01:29:43.931 --> 01:29:47.054]  I want you to tell us what you think is most important and ideas for fail safes.
[01:29:47.334 --> 01:29:48.295]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:49.996 --> 01:29:50.897]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.397 --> 01:29:52.999]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.939 --> 01:29:56.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.516 --> 01:30:15.960]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.641]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.676 --> 01:30:33.665]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.426 --> 01:30:41.692]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.392 --> 01:30:51.979]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.800]  I had tried everything.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:06.922]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:32:07.342 --> 01:32:11.823]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:32:12.163 --> 01:32:18.545]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:32:19.045 --> 01:32:29.512]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:34.396]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:32:34.736 --> 01:32:40.760]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:42.141]  Now that's results.
[01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:55.049]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.311]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:32:57.611 --> 01:32:59.232]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:33:14.113 --> 01:33:30.188]  PhD in computer science and engineering, expert in programming, forensics, biometrics, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, you name it.
[01:33:31.365 --> 01:33:41.594]  Dr. Roman Jampoloski is our guest and professor, I know people can go to louisville.edu and find you.
[01:33:42.375 --> 01:33:47.860]  What's the best way for people to read your paper or to look at the important research you're doing?
[01:33:48.969 --> 01:33:51.570]  A lot of my papers are available for free on the internet.
[01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:54.591]  Just search for my name, you'll find lots of PDFs.
[01:33:55.291 --> 01:33:58.372]  If you want to email me, my address is posted on my website.
[01:33:58.452 --> 01:34:01.533]  I'm happy to send a paper to anyone interested.
[01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:05.454]  Well, you're very gracious to spend time with us.
[01:34:06.594 --> 01:34:08.355]  I've got a lot of questions I could ask, but
[01:34:10.005 --> 01:34:17.171]  If you had ten minutes to talk to three million people, which you are, what would you impart to them about why this is important?
[01:34:17.812 --> 01:34:19.634]  And what would you say to government if they were listening?
[01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.336]  Because you better believe government's listening and corporations are listening.
[01:34:22.996 --> 01:34:25.719]  I'm not tooting our horn, but we have Soran's attention here.
[01:34:26.439 --> 01:34:34.927]  What would you say to the system about your research and your research that I see that is concurred with in a lot of other scholarly papers as well?
[01:34:36.033 --> 01:34:39.835]  I would say it's very important to realize we're not talking about science fiction.
[01:34:39.855 --> 01:34:41.496]  This is not just Hollywood movies.
[01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:42.617]  This is now reality.
[01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:47.400]  Those things will happen in the next 20-30 years, most likely.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.461]  So we need to be fully prepared for them.
[01:34:50.042 --> 01:34:55.905]  I personally propose a number of ideas which can help reduce negative effects from those technologies.
[01:34:55.945 --> 01:35:00.328]  For example, just like when we deal with human cloning, we have restrictions on research.
[01:35:00.368 --> 01:35:01.329]  We banned most of it.
[01:35:02.449 --> 01:35:07.713]  Similar restrictions should be in place for developing general artificial intelligence.
[01:35:08.153 --> 01:35:17.219]  Again, I'm not talking about just assistive technologies, but programs capable of completely dominating human intelligence in any domain.
[01:35:17.959 --> 01:35:32.368]  I also proposed the main topic of my paper was on confining those technologies so especially in early stages of development then we're just trying to create those baby AI systems which are learning and growing.
[01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:46.817]  It's important to have them restricted so we can study them properly so they cannot very quickly develop into full-blown super-intelligent systems and essentially escape into the wild like happens with many computer viruses.
[01:35:48.973 --> 01:35:50.874]  I don't know if I have 10 minutes speech prepared.
[01:35:50.974 --> 01:35:52.254]  I'm much better with questions.
[01:35:52.794 --> 01:35:53.314]  No, no, no.
[01:35:54.114 --> 01:35:56.295]  I just want to hear what you have to say.
[01:35:57.915 --> 01:36:05.657]  What about people like Ray Kurzweil and others when they just say, throw open our arms, do whatever the AI says, merge with it, and then we'll just merge with it.
[01:36:06.258 --> 01:36:09.018]  That right there is saying plug it directly into our brain.
[01:36:09.418 --> 01:36:14.920]  All these new video game technologies I know you study and look at are already interfacing us with it.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:24.388]  We're already basically letting the use of calculators destroy arithmetic, word processors destroying spelling.
[01:36:24.729 --> 01:36:38.141]  I mean, I see machines helping humans in many ways, but also more and more turning people into basically jellyfish blobs who are in a trance state, a different varying degrees of mass narcolepsy.
[01:36:39.242 --> 01:36:44.407]  Brainwaves are lowering, people are in more of a dream-like state, the television, all of it.
[01:36:44.427 --> 01:36:51.673]  I mean, I already see just general primitive technology really causing problems in society.
[01:36:51.693 --> 01:36:55.516]  And then you've got the problem of robotics replacing humans' needs.
[01:36:55.556 --> 01:36:57.017]  Well, then what are all the humans going to do?
[01:36:57.037 --> 01:37:00.180]  And Bill Joy says, well, the elite are having discussions just about
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.401]  You know, orderly, getting rid of people.
[01:37:02.421 --> 01:37:07.625]  There are a lot of other bioethics reports saying, you know, really do some draconian things to humanity.
[01:37:07.645 --> 01:37:14.509]  So we're not just fighting with the machines, we're fighting with the intelligentsia and the elite that see the general public as animals.
[01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:17.492]  The general public are playing into that, acting like animals.
[01:37:17.512 --> 01:37:19.273]  I mean, this just all feeds together.
[01:37:20.917 --> 01:37:25.845]  Uh, you are correct to point out that only a few people actually sleeping this debate right now.
[01:37:25.945 --> 01:37:32.294]  Kurzweil is probably number one person who's known for promoting Singularity, for running Singularity University.
[01:37:34.266 --> 01:37:51.931]  There is really no public debate and one of the things I would love to see as a result of this interview is more awareness by the public of those issues where we do have on the next referendum not just questions should human cloning be legal but also questions about intelligent technologies and how dangerous they can be.
[01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:56.710]  Here's an example.
[01:37:56.991 --> 01:38:09.777]  A truly artificially intelligent, self-aware, uncontained system in a matter of days could take over the entire global stock market and basically own most of the assets of the world.
[01:38:10.078 --> 01:38:10.858]  There's an example.
[01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:13.980]  Or it could do the Terminator version and launch
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.202]  Uh, drone attacks with nuclear weapons or neutron bombs and kill the population.
[01:38:19.442 --> 01:38:24.583]  Or, I mean it's just, there's no telling what the, what could happen out of this.
[01:38:24.663 --> 01:38:29.105]  It's just, it's just, I mean what are different scenarios for a machine takeover that you've researched?
[01:38:30.066 --> 01:38:30.806]  Uh, you are right.
[01:38:30.926 --> 01:38:40.750]  No one knows exactly what is going to happen, but the scenarios range from complete extermination of humankind to sort of this technological communism, I wish to say.
[01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:55.536]  Maybe we'll have robots doing all the labor, creating a lot of wealth, because if you can cheaply copy intelligence, cheaply copy 20 years of education, you really have a lot of opportunities for producing products much more affordably.
[01:38:55.976 --> 01:38:57.276]  So it could go either way.
[01:38:57.677 --> 01:39:03.018]  My hope is that we can develop technologies to control those systems and benefit from them.
[01:39:03.118 --> 01:39:09.340]  Obviously, technology has been huge in our successful emergence as a superpower.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.242]  It's important to continue being a superpower, but we have to be very
[01:39:15.882 --> 01:39:18.264]  Very careful in just how we get to that point.
[01:39:31.773 --> 01:39:35.694]  of genetic engineering, nanotech, fused with artificial intelligences.
[01:39:36.454 --> 01:39:42.615]  We could just pretty much immediately have whole space fleets, you name it, mining operations.
[01:39:42.675 --> 01:39:45.096]  The problem is it immediately cuts off humans.
[01:39:45.596 --> 01:39:48.437]  I mean, I see all these movies where humans are out exploring space.
[01:39:48.857 --> 01:39:52.758]  You know, it's already to the point where it's all going to be robot.
[01:39:52.838 --> 01:39:54.478]  It's all going to be drone.
[01:39:55.178 --> 01:39:58.179]  And so we're just
[01:39:59.891 --> 01:40:07.236]  I mean, I don't really see many paths where this doesn't actually shut us off and we get walled off by the computers if they're nice enough to keep us around.
[01:40:08.197 --> 01:40:08.497]  You're right.
[01:40:08.517 --> 01:40:09.798]  You mentioned Bill Joy.
[01:40:09.898 --> 01:40:13.020]  He wrote an article saying, does the future really need us?
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.961]  And that's the big question.
[01:40:15.081 --> 01:40:26.148]  If those technologies continue on the path they are, if we are successful as it looks like we're going to be, then really the place of humanity is in question.
[01:40:26.228 --> 01:40:27.049]  If you have machines
[01:40:27.469 --> 01:40:27.929]  I think so.
[01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:07.855]  Doctor, I'd like to see some debate about that as well, but I don't see the so-called elite acting like they're concerned about anything.
[01:41:07.915 --> 01:41:16.160]  I mean, they're too into strutting around like peacocks and going to balls five nights a week and playing golf
[01:41:17.128 --> 01:41:33.279]  And more and more, I realize that they're following some 500-year-old, you know, older Byzantine model of corporate empire and don't understand that they're holding either our total empowerment in their hands or our total destruction.
[01:41:34.199 --> 01:41:46.608]  And using my little supercomputer, my brain, I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but my gut, which is really just a subconscious analysis of all the factors, tells me, danger Will Robinson.
[01:41:47.475 --> 01:41:50.797]  Well, it's also possible that technology will be a great equalizer.
[01:41:50.897 --> 01:41:57.640]  Computers are now affordable, cheap, and they benefit everyone, not just the richest people, most powerful people.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.822]  So, similar things can happen with intelligent technologies.
[01:42:01.202 --> 01:42:09.446]  If everyone has access to them, if they are affordable, everyone can greatly benefit from it, so we might have a much better situation in terms of... I agree with you.
[01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:12.748]  Look at how the Internet has empowered the rise of the new media.
[01:42:13.971 --> 01:42:14.391]  Exactly.
[01:42:14.892 --> 01:42:17.334]  And it completely changed media in the process.
[01:42:17.414 --> 01:42:19.795]  I mean, now anyone can be a journalist, have a blog.
[01:42:20.596 --> 01:42:22.377]  Censorship becomes almost impossible.
[01:42:22.417 --> 01:42:24.959]  Look at what it's doing with Arab Spring.
[01:42:25.019 --> 01:42:26.781]  I mean, Twitter, Facebook.
[01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:34.847]  So those technologies will change our world very quickly, and we don't really know how the final product will look.
[01:42:35.979 --> 01:42:36.260]  Sure.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:47.799]  My concern, Doctor, and again we're talking about artificial intelligence basically enslaving or overthrowing or taking over humanity in the near future, and there's really no debate about it outside of science fiction circles, but we are 2012.
[01:42:47.939 --> 01:42:49.902]  It is Buck Rogers here.
[01:42:50.828 --> 01:42:59.714]  Again, I like nuclear power, but the way it's implemented, the corporations are so corrupt that they don't care if it's blowing up and radiating at everybody.
[01:43:00.115 --> 01:43:01.175]  So that's my concern.
[01:43:01.215 --> 01:43:08.741]  Yes, this could all obviously empower us, but as you've said, there doesn't seem to be any thinking it through, and therein lies the danger.
[01:43:09.853 --> 01:43:10.073]  Right.
[01:43:10.173 --> 01:43:12.575]  The problem is how quickly those technologies change.
[01:43:12.635 --> 01:43:17.238]  I mean, a new iPhone comes out every year, but really that's not the measure of that.
[01:43:17.318 --> 01:43:25.763]  The progress is made in algorithms and hardware to the point where we don't have infrastructure to adapt to this change.
[01:43:25.883 --> 01:43:27.884]  Our legislative process is very slow.
[01:43:28.184 --> 01:43:32.567]  To pass a new law might take a few years, or this new technology might appear overnight.
[01:43:34.485 --> 01:43:57.032]  Now, you talk about in the development of these systems, from your research, and we're going to go to calls, what type of current, just hypothetically, you know, your class was asking you, hypothetically, Doctor, what do you think is the most likely form of a cascading effect with computers that would lead to truly artificially intelligent and artificially aware and autonomous?
[01:43:57.592 --> 01:44:01.633]  I would say automatically, obviously, the already autonomous drones that they're now launching.
[01:44:02.333 --> 01:44:04.437]  Other than that, is it video games?
[01:44:04.497 --> 01:44:06.740]  Is it going to be human-machine interfaces?
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:16.336]  You know, like they thought, as you said, 50 years ago with the chess and took a lot longer than they thought for Big Blue, Deep Blue to start beating, you know, the best Russian chess champions or whatever?
[01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:19.527]  Human brain interfaces have a huge promise.
[01:44:19.747 --> 01:44:25.111]  We already know how to read individual ideas from your brain, to spot individual words.
[01:44:25.811 --> 01:44:29.654]  Memories can be created by sending signals to appropriate parts of the brain.
[01:44:30.074 --> 01:44:40.742]  So essentially by scanning a human brain and creating a simulation of it, or integrating an additional module into a human brain, you can create a super-intelligent system essentially.
[01:44:41.102 --> 01:44:43.864]  So that's probably something with a lot of promise, but
[01:44:44.304 --> 01:44:49.227]  Any one of the currently investigated technologies can turn out to be very promising.
[01:45:04.108 --> 01:45:04.688]  Absolutely.
[01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:07.530]  In fact, that's what's already happening.
[01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:11.672]  We don't have those technologies implanted in our brains, but we're using them.
[01:45:11.712 --> 01:45:14.773]  I can't think of myself functioning without access to Internet.
[01:45:14.793 --> 01:45:18.155]  It's like my external memory drive, essentially.
[01:45:18.195 --> 01:45:20.776]  You're already interfacing the biggest library in history.
[01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:21.977]  Exactly.
[01:45:22.617 --> 01:45:23.957]  So, I mean, that's what I found.
[01:45:23.977 --> 01:45:26.719]  The Internet has caused me to just have an incredible brain boost.
[01:45:27.941 --> 01:45:29.222]  And now it's always following us.
[01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:36.145]  If you have a phone, it's a smartphone that has internet, that has access to all the information civilization ever produced.
[01:45:36.565 --> 01:45:39.867]  You can control a lot of external devices.
[01:45:40.287 --> 01:45:41.428]  You can do almost anything.
[01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:44.169]  And the next step is to have those things implanted in us.
[01:45:44.269 --> 01:45:47.551]  And research is already taking place in hybrid systems like
[01:45:48.188 --> 01:46:04.925]  What about the paradox, though, of authoritarian governments putting back doors into implanted devices, which we know they always do with other devices, to where you think you're getting a piece of machinery to get your vision back, which who would want that, or a, you know, liver, whatever it is, but really it's got piggyback things on it.
[01:46:05.845 --> 01:46:06.465]  Absolutely.
[01:46:06.926 --> 01:46:08.006]  That's very likely.
[01:46:08.046 --> 01:46:15.271]  In fact, many cases have been shown where corporations put back doors and we don't really know what the federal government is doing.
[01:46:16.331 --> 01:46:21.795]  Also, something you want to think about is if this super-intelligent machine will be able to
[01:46:22.515 --> 01:46:24.376]  Outsource all sorts of jobs.
[01:46:25.416 --> 01:46:26.036]  Standard jobs.
[01:46:26.136 --> 01:46:27.597]  Why not the government itself?
[01:46:27.697 --> 01:46:32.819]  I mean, they can be said to be not bribeable.
[01:46:33.239 --> 01:46:34.700]  They don't have to take vacations.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:39.402]  So maybe they would be the next level of our government legislative process.
[01:46:39.682 --> 01:46:42.743]  We might be looking at artificial decision makers in Washington.
[01:46:44.039 --> 01:46:52.121]  But then you'd have secret hacks and all sorts of deals and, you know, that's kind of what the Zeitgeist Movement pushes is this supercomputer that'll make all the decisions.
[01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:56.262]  But, man, I tell you, it is a brave new world we're entering.
[01:46:56.302 --> 01:47:00.142]  Let's go to some phone calls with the doctor, who I really appreciate spending time with us.
[01:47:00.483 --> 01:47:02.483]  Henry in California, you're first up.
[01:47:02.503 --> 01:47:02.863]  Go ahead.
[01:47:03.503 --> 01:47:03.803]  Hello.
[01:47:04.263 --> 01:47:05.924]  I'm curious about the hardware end.
[01:47:06.204 --> 01:47:11.785]  And if future machines, you know, all AI would have to live on a machine, if they're going to use
[01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:14.899]  Spin Transistors and Spin Tronics!
[01:47:18.141 --> 01:47:21.182]  I have no idea what exactly they're going to use.
[01:47:21.282 --> 01:47:23.564]  Quantum computing is believed to be the next step.
[01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:28.726]  Moore's Law is coming to its logical conclusion when it comes to standard transistors.
[01:47:29.246 --> 01:47:33.748]  There is a lot of research in developing the next paradigm to continue the Moore's Law.
[01:47:34.288 --> 01:47:36.549]  What exactly is going to be used in the next step?
[01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:44.313]  Well, isn't it really genetic computers that are life form, human life or animal life based, where they then program it into the genetics?
[01:47:45.478 --> 01:47:48.521]  Well, there is genetic programming and genetic algorithms.
[01:47:48.721 --> 01:47:53.725]  They have not been terribly successful in creating truly intelligent systems.
[01:47:53.745 --> 01:48:10.260]  They are very good at optimizing different parameters for functions, so if you need to tweak arguments, those are excellent, but they have not been shown to be capable of sort of this evolutionary improvement from nothing to full-blown intelligence.
[01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:12.242]  Alright, anything else, Henry?
[01:48:13.504 --> 01:48:22.366]  I'm curious about if it would ever involve a space segment, especially with issues of relativistic timing.
[01:48:24.567 --> 01:48:36.892]  If there is ever technology which allows us to use what physicists say is a possibility of time travel, then there are some technologies, some algorithms which incorporate this idea.
[01:48:36.912 --> 01:48:48.776]  I recently seen a paper which shows how NP-complete problems could be solved if you have access to a time travel device, but this is really well beyond what my comfort zone is in terms of science versus
[01:48:49.316 --> 01:48:58.426]  But they did just, well they had a bunch of news tests come out where they have actually, just like Star Trek, beamed matter across distances, teleported it.
[01:48:58.486 --> 01:48:59.347]  Teleportation.
[01:48:59.888 --> 01:49:01.529]  They're now creating artificial black holes.
[01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:05.233]  I think it's only a matter of time until they do something in a lab and kill everybody.
[01:49:05.914 --> 01:49:07.534]  I just pray we don't destroy ourselves.
[01:49:07.734 --> 01:49:10.195]  Because, folks, we are getting the fire of Prometheus here.
[01:49:10.235 --> 01:49:11.855]  This is not a joke.
[01:49:12.175 --> 01:49:12.776]  Thank you, Henry.
[01:49:12.816 --> 01:49:13.916]  Really good questions.
[01:49:14.756 --> 01:49:16.776]  Let's go to... Who's up next here?
[01:49:16.876 --> 01:49:18.357]  Woody in Washington.
[01:49:18.377 --> 01:49:18.977]  You're on the air.
[01:49:19.017 --> 01:49:19.437]  Go ahead.
[01:49:19.457 --> 01:49:20.897]  Yes.
[01:49:20.957 --> 01:49:21.577]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:21.637 --> 01:49:22.858]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:49:23.298 --> 01:49:33.480]  My question for this gentleman is, with this AI intelligence, how far away are we from the point where all of these systems could be integrated
[01:49:34.353 --> 01:49:36.135]  Well, the systems are already fully integrated.
[01:49:36.655 --> 01:49:44.183]  The question of how soon before they become intelligent, and as I said, that's anywhere between 20 and 80 years, depending on how conservative you want to be with estimates.
[01:49:57.686 --> 01:50:00.567]  And I can add to that data with a big data point.
[01:50:00.967 --> 01:50:05.388]  The Pentagon within 10 years wants all combat aircraft, drone, helicopters, everything.
[01:50:05.468 --> 01:50:07.209]  Only transports will be human.
[01:50:08.029 --> 01:50:09.450]  And those will be computer backup.
[01:50:10.190 --> 01:50:13.071]  Most of the ground force within 10 years will be combat robots.
[01:50:13.151 --> 01:50:14.271]  That's now been declassified.
[01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:15.992]  And they've got a bunch of them that are really scary.
[01:50:16.012 --> 01:50:18.632]  They haven't rolled out to the public because they don't want to freak people out yet.
[01:50:18.672 --> 01:50:20.033]  But I've talked to high-level military.
[01:50:20.533 --> 01:50:26.635]  And so within 10 years, the machines, if they took over, most of the big militaries are going to be robot and drone.
[01:50:28.415 --> 01:50:31.336]  It is the Terminator scenario, if they wanted to kill us that way.
[01:50:33.657 --> 01:50:40.539]  We'll be right back with the good doctor, Dr. Roman Jampoloski, and we'll give you his email if you want to contact him.
[01:50:40.559 --> 01:50:41.919]  He's graciously said we can do that.
[01:50:42.259 --> 01:50:43.500]  More of your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:53.342]  Hopefully he'll join us again for another discussion, because I just want to have grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and I want them to be able to use technology to be empowered, not to be wiped from the face of the universe.
[01:50:53.743 --> 01:50:54.183]  Stay with us.
[01:51:03.437 --> 01:51:07.481]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:51:07.901 --> 01:51:10.884]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:51:11.244 --> 01:51:15.328]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[01:51:15.648 --> 01:51:16.268]  Here's why.
[01:51:16.649 --> 01:51:22.414]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:51:22.754 --> 01:51:27.276]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:51:27.616 --> 01:51:33.698]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:51:33.998 --> 01:51:37.640]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:43.402]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:51:43.782 --> 01:51:49.124]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:51:49.404 --> 01:51:52.249]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[01:51:52.409 --> 01:51:54.612]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:52:00.472 --> 01:52:06.115]  Would it save you time to get the best quality water filters and the best quality storable foods from one company?
[01:52:06.496 --> 01:52:07.256]  You bet it would!
[01:52:07.516 --> 01:52:08.577]  And now you can!
[01:52:08.897 --> 01:52:11.078]  At BigBerkyWaterFilters.com.
[01:52:11.338 --> 01:52:19.103]  Big Berky Water Filter products and great tasting, long lasting, storable Wyze Foods are both now available on one website.
[01:52:19.363 --> 01:52:21.264]  BigBerkyWaterFilters.com.
[01:52:21.524 --> 01:52:22.225]  Wyze Foods.
[01:52:22.425 --> 01:52:27.448]  Ready to eat meals are packed in airtight nitrogen pouches and come with a 25 year shelf life.
[01:52:27.748 --> 01:52:29.069]  Big Berky Water Filters are
[01:52:29.329 --> 01:52:29.589]  We're good.
[01:52:45.848 --> 01:52:51.154]  Visit bigberkeywaterfilters.com or call 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:52:51.214 --> 01:52:52.215]  That's 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:52:52.255 --> 01:52:53.837]  Or go to bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:53:02.066 --> 01:53:07.688]  And while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[01:53:08.148 --> 01:53:12.370]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:22.594]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns, or are receiving threatening letters or phone calls, call the Tax Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[01:53:22.614 --> 01:53:24.854]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent
[01:53:29.016 --> 01:53:31.258]  with over 31 years experience.
[01:53:31.418 --> 01:53:35.803]  He knows the ins and outs of the IRS and how to get them off your back once and for all.
[01:53:36.183 --> 01:53:38.866]  The phone call is free and so is the consultation.
[01:53:38.946 --> 01:53:39.847]  So call now 800-652-6978.
[01:53:39.907 --> 01:53:40.107]  That's 800-652-6978.
[01:53:47.074 --> 01:53:49.538]  Don't wait for agents to knock on your door.
[01:53:49.658 --> 01:53:51.561]  Call 800-652-6978 or visit us on the web at www.craigzlaw.com.
[01:53:51.582 --> 01:53:52.543]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:54:07.398 --> 01:54:10.879]  Alright, our guests will be like five minutes to the next hour so we can get to all the calls on the board.
[01:54:10.899 --> 01:54:16.140]  I haven't even gotten to the fact that Orlando Airport is set to kick the TSA out.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:19.801]  That story from Infowars.com is also up on the Drudge Report.
[01:54:25.142 --> 01:54:33.423]  Doctor, did you want to make any other points on the gentleman talking about the military being in a position to be taken over by AI?
[01:54:33.443 --> 01:54:35.564]  I mean, the numbers they admit as we're talking
[01:54:36.843 --> 01:54:43.011]  Ten years and almost everything is going to be drone or combat robot tanks.
[01:54:44.252 --> 01:54:44.592]  All of it.
[01:54:44.632 --> 01:54:46.014]  I mean, they don't need sleep.
[01:54:46.615 --> 01:54:47.396]  They never stop.
[01:54:47.416 --> 01:54:50.640]  They're worked on by robots that are delivered in robot ships.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:53.583]  They've got some technicians on board in case there's problems.
[01:54:53.924 --> 01:54:56.327]  But that's what this is all going towards is total automation.
[01:54:57.228 --> 01:54:57.428]  Right.
[01:54:57.548 --> 01:55:03.292]  In addition to the technology itself being dangerous, there's also the possibility of human hackers taking over.
[01:55:03.313 --> 01:55:04.994]  We saw a U.S.
[01:55:05.694 --> 01:55:07.956]  drone being taken over by Iranians.
[01:55:08.496 --> 01:55:17.302]  If the same thing happens with more capable controllers and they try to use the same technologies against us, that could really backfire.
[01:55:18.283 --> 01:55:24.407]  There's quite a few scenarios we need to think about before developing and deploying those technologies.
[01:55:24.788 --> 01:55:38.357]  I agree with you that this all needs to be basically heavily restricted immediately because the probability is it's going to cause disaster and I'm all for technological development
[01:55:38.957 --> 01:55:44.781]  And I know the system shuts down things that are disruptive to the economy, like freer forms of energy and things.
[01:55:44.801 --> 01:55:46.022]  I don't think that should be restricted.
[01:55:46.302 --> 01:55:57.811]  But AI systems, super high-powered antimatter weapons the Air Force admits they're developing, all this type of stuff, it just needs to be restricted.
[01:55:59.508 --> 01:56:03.790]  I agree with you, and the combination of those technologies is completely unpredictable.
[01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:13.594]  If AI is doing the research, if AI is performing experiments on nanotechnology and genetic algorithms, no one can possibly even estimate what the results would be like.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:17.441]  Well, you talked about it modeling people's brains.
[01:56:17.481 --> 01:56:19.382]  A lot of the most promising stuff are these interfaces.
[01:56:19.663 --> 01:56:21.944]  That's why I'm saying you could actually get some human traits.
[01:56:22.644 --> 01:56:34.731]  If the model it builds from, at its kernel or base, is a human mind, it could get some of the good traits of emotion or bad, but that inter- just, again, I'm not a computer scientist like you are.
[01:56:35.151 --> 01:56:42.135]  I just, if it's modeling off humans and being programmed by the technocrats, a lot of them who are completely out of their minds, I don't know what these things are going to be like.
[01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:49.585]  It's a very good question and it's important to know whose brain are we scanning, whose model are we creating to be that powerful.
[01:56:49.705 --> 01:56:51.986]  So, that's another unanswered question.
[01:56:53.247 --> 01:56:53.747]  Exactly.
[01:56:53.787 --> 01:56:59.050]  If it was Mother Teresa or something, it might not be a problem, but what if it's some... It still could be a problem.
[01:56:59.110 --> 01:57:00.791]  Great power corrupts absolutely.
[01:57:00.891 --> 01:57:06.555]  So, I wouldn't trust any person to have that kind of capabilities.
[01:57:06.855 --> 01:57:07.495]  I agree with you.
[01:57:08.236 --> 01:57:09.957]  Daryl in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:57:09.997 --> 01:57:10.297]  Go ahead.
[01:57:14.048 --> 01:57:14.869]  Turn your radio off.
[01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:16.291]  Go ahead, Darryl.
[01:57:16.391 --> 01:57:16.911]  I got it off.
[01:57:17.472 --> 01:57:18.433]  Hey, glad to meet you, Alex.
[01:57:18.453 --> 01:57:18.954]  You're the man.
[01:57:19.654 --> 01:57:20.355]  And hi, Ron.
[01:57:21.336 --> 01:57:25.241]  Let's see, have you had anything to do with the NAO robots?
[01:57:28.742 --> 01:57:31.904]  No, I don't actually.
[01:57:31.924 --> 01:57:34.826]  I know what it is.
[01:57:34.906 --> 01:57:42.111]  It's a robot framework they use for a lot of research, especially in education and such.
[01:57:42.671 --> 01:57:44.613]  I don't develop physical robots.
[01:57:44.633 --> 01:57:46.954]  I like playing with them, but I don't actually.
[01:57:46.974 --> 01:57:49.176]  Yes, I'm more interested in minds than bodies.
[01:57:58.335 --> 01:58:11.243]  Alex, I just want to tell you about what my professor revealed to us, talking about the dimensions of a supercomputer that exists right now currently in Alaska, which dovetails almost perfectly with what Nick Begich has been saying.
[01:58:11.844 --> 01:58:22.190]  He said that it was actually the size of the state of New Jersey, and that it was aware of itself already, existing right now in the current time.
[01:58:22.290 --> 01:58:23.651]  It's the paradigm destroyer.
[01:58:24.711 --> 01:58:26.873]  What do you mean, a computer the size of New Jersey?
[01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:38.633]  This man, this professor, went on to, in his lecture, reveal to all of us, which most of them were acting like potted plants, these fellow students... Stay there, I want to hear the name and details.
[01:58:41.133 --> 01:58:42.234]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.254 --> 01:58:45.354]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.024 --> 01:58:56.427]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:57.688 --> 01:59:02.451]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.831 --> 01:59:09.615]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.556 --> 01:59:13.837]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:15.618 --> 01:59:17.880]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:20.032 --> 01:59:23.895]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[01:59:48.215 --> 01:59:48.715]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:55.491]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.971 --> 01:59:58.813]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.236 --> 02:00:05.897]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.557 --> 02:00:07.597]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.318 --> 02:00:09.438]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.079 --> 02:00:10.899]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:12.580]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.862]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.403 --> 02:00:21.465]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.168 --> 02:00:30.449]  Dr. Roman V. Yompolosky is our guest professor, director of Cyber Security Lab.
[02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:35.450]  You can read his whole bio at thelouisville.edu.
[02:00:36.710 --> 02:00:37.230]  R-Y.
[02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:39.971]  And he joins us.
[02:00:40.011 --> 02:00:42.551]  We only have like five minutes left with him.
[02:00:43.312 --> 02:00:46.992]  And we were just talking to Vince in Montana.
[02:00:47.292 --> 02:00:48.392]  What's the name of the professor?
[02:00:48.472 --> 02:00:49.413]  What's the name of the computer?
[02:00:49.453 --> 02:00:50.013]  Where was this?
[02:00:50.053 --> 02:00:51.093]  The people were telling you this.
[02:00:52.119 --> 02:00:53.200]  Actually, my name is Hector.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:01:08.832]  The name of the college that I go to, I can't really tell you the name of the professor for fear of the knowledge that he's talking about, but what he said was the dimensions of it is that it is the size of New Jersey, but it resides in Alaska, which leads me to believe that it's underground.
[02:01:09.502 --> 02:01:11.823]  The other thing that he said was that it was conscious.
[02:01:12.083 --> 02:01:12.844]  It is conscious.
[02:01:12.884 --> 02:01:13.584]  It is self-aware.
[02:01:13.604 --> 02:01:17.426]  Listen, I'm not going to listen to this when somebody says their professor told them, but it's secret.
[02:01:17.826 --> 02:01:19.007]  He said he's giving a lecture.
[02:01:19.107 --> 02:01:28.692]  I mean, number one, they can be talking about your intestines, you know, stretch out 500 feet or whatever, like all the contours of something, you know, has, has, has the surface of New Jersey.
[02:01:28.732 --> 02:01:33.655]  I could see that with all the, all the motherboards or whatever, or all the computing space.
[02:01:34.796 --> 02:01:36.460]  I just don't get off into the speculation.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:36.821]  Thank you.
[02:01:37.142 --> 02:01:40.449]  I think that's a great question though that that leads me to with our guest.
[02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:44.278]  Doctor, what is the most advanced computer that we know of right now?
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.722]  Well, to first answer the question, he claimed the computer was conscious.
[02:01:48.962 --> 02:01:49.662]  How would they know?
[02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:53.264]  We don't have any tests to see if a system is conscious or not.
[02:01:53.404 --> 02:01:56.486]  So that alone is very suspicious sounding to me.
[02:01:57.286 --> 02:02:03.189]  As far as the most advanced system, there is again very few ways to test intelligence in general.
[02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:05.350]  We have IQ tests for humans.
[02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:06.731]  Some claim they are biased.
[02:02:07.071 --> 02:02:12.994]  There is no way to test intelligence across species, humans... How does Deep Blue beat the best chess masters now?
[02:02:13.994 --> 02:02:24.900]  A lot of progress in AI has been made based on improvements in hardware.
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:31.583]  Algorithms which couldn't do it before, as better computers become available, are quite capable of doing things.
[02:02:31.883 --> 02:02:43.891]  Speech recognition, translation are perfect examples of cases where just having a lot of data, powerful computers allows you to do what you couldn't do before without really any novel ideas.
[02:02:45.112 --> 02:02:57.101]  The best system I would say right now is again IBM's Watson computer and it also relies on essentially downloading internet to a local disk and having access to complete information about everything.
[02:02:57.521 --> 02:02:58.882]  So it's another example of
[02:02:59.382 --> 02:03:00.103]  Very interesting.
[02:03:00.163 --> 02:03:01.723]  Vince in Montana.
[02:03:01.763 --> 02:03:02.864]  Go ahead, Vince.
[02:03:09.856 --> 02:03:11.717]  Dr. Jablonski, very interesting show.
[02:03:12.117 --> 02:03:31.101]  Given that all of the computers are military-based, and all of the heuristics that this system that's going to develop, all of the heuristics are going to be contaminated with military applications that kill humans, how are we ever going to write a prime directive rule that makes human life sacrosanct?
[02:03:31.201 --> 02:03:32.242]  Wouldn't we be better to...
[02:03:33.542 --> 02:03:37.535]  It's the opposite of the rule that Isaac Asimov came up with.
[02:03:37.876 --> 02:03:39.622]  They're being designed from the beginning to kill.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:43.561]  Well, rules typically don't work in such systems.
[02:03:43.661 --> 02:03:49.263]  If a system is smart enough, it will always find loopholes in any set of rules you develop for it.
[02:03:49.303 --> 02:03:51.344]  We see it with humans and laws of the past.
[02:03:51.404 --> 02:03:58.227]  That's why every year we post another million new laws just to keep up with smart people coming up with all the loopholes.
[02:03:58.647 --> 02:04:06.010]  So the approach of just hard-coding, don't kill humans, will probably not work as illustrated by every novel Asimov ever wrote.
[02:04:06.710 --> 02:04:15.372]  We need something better, and that's exactly the type of research I'm advocating for, trying to figure out how to develop systems which... Amazing.
[02:04:15.552 --> 02:04:22.294]  ...essentially don't want to harm humans, not because we are... Yeah, we better not just try to count on them being well-behaved.
[02:04:22.314 --> 02:04:23.655]  We better be in control right now.
[02:04:24.155 --> 02:04:24.575]  Exactly.
[02:04:25.413 --> 02:04:26.994]  All right, very impressive, Professor.
[02:04:27.054 --> 02:04:27.835]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:27.855 --> 02:04:32.519]  Hopefully in a month or so you'll come back with us and take more calls because this is just riveting.
[02:04:33.379 --> 02:04:35.201]  And I really appreciate your time.
[02:04:35.641 --> 02:04:36.842]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:04:36.882 --> 02:04:37.763]  I would love to be back.
[02:04:37.963 --> 02:04:38.423]  It was awesome.
[02:04:38.683 --> 02:04:39.564]  It was awesome having you.
[02:04:39.624 --> 02:04:39.904]  Wow.
[02:04:40.345 --> 02:04:46.730]  That's the type of stuff that gives our our society a future is having discussions about this, not about Britney Spears or
[02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:50.274]  About Jay-Z or whatever, but about this type of stuff.
[02:04:50.374 --> 02:04:51.496]  This is what's amazing.
[02:04:51.856 --> 02:04:53.018]  This is what's interesting.
[02:04:53.098 --> 02:04:54.900]  This is what is thought-provoking.
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:56.402]  Big news straight ahead.
[02:04:56.482 --> 02:04:57.103]  It's important.
[02:04:57.123 --> 02:04:57.584]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.656 --> 02:05:03.137]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.357 --> 02:05:08.378]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:08.658 --> 02:05:10.019]  Saving means to make money.

[02:05:27.244 --> 02:05:34.867]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.247 --> 02:05:40.168]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:06:00.157 --> 02:06:07.141]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:06:07.401 --> 02:06:25.011]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:06:25.272 --> 02:06:29.394]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:06:29.654 --> 02:06:31.235]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:06:31.435 --> 02:06:39.260]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:08:10.247 --> 02:08:11.048]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.829 --> 02:08:12.809]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.370 --> 02:08:16.992]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.573 --> 02:08:21.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.297 --> 02:08:27.359]  Alright, I'll continue with your calls discussing the Terminator scenario.
[02:08:28.815 --> 02:08:35.759]  Uh, these already autonomous drones and systems becoming artificially aware and trying to take over human society.
[02:08:35.819 --> 02:08:38.521]  Most of the top computer scientists believe it's going to happen.
[02:08:39.081 --> 02:08:41.443]  Many of them say, like Ray Kurzweil, you can't stop it.
[02:08:41.463 --> 02:08:44.825]  Uh, when we go to your calls, I'm sure people are holding to cover that.
[02:08:44.885 --> 02:08:45.825]  Our guest is gone.
[02:08:45.845 --> 02:08:48.847]  I need to get back into some more of the news here first.
[02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:49.988]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[02:08:50.628 --> 02:08:51.969]  And then we'll continue with your calls.
[02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.750]  Uh, one thing.
[02:08:53.650 --> 02:09:00.895]  I'm so obsessed with the news and information now that I never even plug products, books, videos, sponsors, any of it.
[02:09:00.975 --> 02:09:08.499]  And I think that's a bad thing, A, because this is key information to get out to the public, and B, it funds the InfoWars operation.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:18.726]  And I want to thank all of you that get subscriptions at PrisonPlanet.tv to see the radio show and watch the nightly news and all my films and get the high-quality podcast with a 15-day free trial there.
[02:09:19.366 --> 02:09:21.927]  I want to thank all of you that do buy the books and videos and t-shirts.
[02:09:21.947 --> 02:09:33.389]  Not only do you get great materials to educate yourself to a higher level, it's also riveting information, but also to pay it forward and give to others, or meet like-minded people by wearing the InfoWars t-shirts and things like that.
[02:09:33.969 --> 02:09:37.610]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:38.410 --> 02:09:43.091]  The two books, When Technology Fails and When Disaster Strikes.
[02:09:43.311 --> 02:09:44.871]  And it's not because we live in fear.
[02:09:45.391 --> 02:09:48.192]  We're covering this so we can be aware of it and be empowered.
[02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:58.187]  You know, if I say, hey, to my son, you know, we're going to go out to the lake today, we're going to be fishing, be careful when you walk off from me in tall grass, walk on the paths, there could be water mongooses.
[02:09:58.248 --> 02:10:00.709]  It's not be fearful, it's be in charge.
[02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:04.532]  Be aware of what's going on and how to respond.
[02:10:05.553 --> 02:10:10.096]  When disaster strikes, when technology fails by MIT educated design engineer,
[02:10:14.625 --> 02:10:16.767]  Bloodlines Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier.
[02:10:16.827 --> 02:10:19.630]  Incredible book on how sick these people are and why they're so crazy.
[02:10:20.131 --> 02:10:22.173]  Behind the Green Mask, Agenda 21.
[02:10:22.413 --> 02:10:25.796]  Excellent book to get to every county commissioner, city councils.
[02:10:26.057 --> 02:10:27.558]  By the way, I've seen a couple of big cities.
[02:10:27.578 --> 02:10:32.283]  What, Bryan College Station passed a law against Agenda 21 and found out they were under it and kicked it out.
[02:10:32.683 --> 02:10:34.045]  Just Monday I saw that.
[02:10:34.065 --> 02:10:34.965]  I mean, there's stuff happening.
[02:10:35.926 --> 02:10:41.027]  Uh, Romans 13, how the government uses this submit to corrupt government when that's not what the Bible says.
[02:10:41.407 --> 02:10:43.008]  Great book to get to all your pastors.
[02:10:44.008 --> 02:10:51.109]  Uh, and of course, all orders get a free citizen rule book, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and more famous quotes, jury nullification.
[02:10:51.689 --> 02:10:58.671]  And we also are doing a deal at cost, where it's, the computer's gotta have something put in there, so it's one penny.
[02:10:59.693 --> 02:11:00.253]  I don't know.
[02:11:18.464 --> 02:11:20.986]  And you pay for the shipping $4.95 and that's what it cost me.
[02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:24.709]  The shipping and handling actually ends up costing me a little bit more after, you know, the guy's packaging the stuff.
[02:11:24.729 --> 02:11:25.770]  The point is that's there.
[02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:27.791]  We're going to keep that going at least for a few weeks.
[02:11:29.513 --> 02:11:30.814]  It's having a big effect.
[02:11:30.894 --> 02:11:32.555]  So, InfoWars.com.
[02:11:33.115 --> 02:11:36.098]  You have no idea the calls we get, the people on the streets.
[02:11:36.238 --> 02:11:37.499]  So many people wake up.
[02:11:37.879 --> 02:11:42.723]  Police officers, school teachers, mayors, military people.
[02:11:43.223 --> 02:11:50.904]  Everybody, when somebody just gives them one of my films that they've copied or a business card that people printed up or people write Infowars.com on the money.
[02:11:52.825 --> 02:11:58.106]  I'm not saying do that because it's some little federal thing but that's how a lot of folks tell me they're waking up.
[02:11:59.206 --> 02:12:09.448]  So whatever you do, take action today and thank you for supporting us and please also support our local AM and FM affiliates out there by supporting their local sponsors.
[02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:12.345]  Okay, you know, I don't know where to start with the stack.
[02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:16.068]  I mean, this is all just crazy, the amount of news.
[02:12:16.088 --> 02:12:20.311]  I got some of it in the first hour, but let me just start now as best I can ahead of your calls.
[02:12:21.552 --> 02:12:22.093]  Daily Mail.
[02:12:22.273 --> 02:12:25.336]  It makes me ill how many people talk about ripping clients off.
[02:12:25.736 --> 02:12:28.959]  Goldman Sachs executive quits over firm's toxic culture.
[02:12:29.419 --> 02:12:31.321]  An extraordinary resignation letter.
[02:12:32.847 --> 02:12:34.087]  And I want to try to get this guy on.
[02:12:34.127 --> 02:12:34.888]  This just broke.
[02:12:35.328 --> 02:12:36.648]  Boy, I don't know how long he's going to be alive.
[02:12:37.409 --> 02:12:43.271]  And, of course, their emails have gotten out where they talk about selling people stuff that they know is absolute crud and laughing at them.
[02:12:43.291 --> 02:12:45.231]  I mean, it's one thing to rip somebody off.
[02:12:45.251 --> 02:12:45.871]  That's bad enough.
[02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:48.092]  They giggle and snicker and enjoy.
[02:12:48.112 --> 02:12:52.194]  Or when, you know, there's an earthquake, they say, oh, that was my wallet falling.
[02:12:52.234 --> 02:12:59.296]  I mean, it's because I've learned people who are criminal and don't have a soul or whose soul is darkened, they
[02:13:01.075 --> 02:13:04.397]  It's not, they just don't, they just can't help but rip everybody off.
[02:13:04.497 --> 02:13:05.717]  I mean, who wants to be around that?
[02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:08.018]  It just creates a toxic society.
[02:13:08.038 --> 02:13:15.522]  Of course, you have the Timberwolf emails that were a division of Goldman Sachs, where they're like, this is absolute bleeping, can't wait to rip my clients off.
[02:13:15.862 --> 02:13:17.263]  You know, just like, wow.
[02:13:18.343 --> 02:13:18.604]  Wow.
[02:13:18.644 --> 02:13:23.726]  And these are the people that are funding the global carbon taxes, the takeovers, the African invasions.
[02:13:23.786 --> 02:13:25.467]  I mean, they're the takeover of Europe.
[02:13:25.767 --> 02:13:27.268]  This is who runs the global government.
[02:13:27.895 --> 02:13:30.877]  And they're a bunch of guys going, I'm only worth 10 billion and that other guy's worth 40.
[02:13:31.117 --> 02:13:32.859]  Rip everybody off!
[02:13:32.939 --> 02:13:35.200]  I've got a, you know, I mean, they're just a bunch of scum.
[02:13:35.921 --> 02:13:42.506]  And they think they're the elite because they don't have empathy or that basic human programming to not be an absolute piece of garbage.
[02:13:44.207 --> 02:13:48.030]  And they're all a bunch of surly, sharky scum.
[02:13:48.130 --> 02:13:51.753]  And I mean, I, my instinct is stomp their heads in, but I'm not going to do that.
[02:13:52.874 --> 02:13:54.295]  They're criminals, we're going to expose them.
[02:13:55.188 --> 02:13:56.269]  And more people are gonna get it.
[02:13:56.289 --> 02:14:05.878]  You know, you guys that are evil wonder why your kids suffer horrible fates, why you're so unhappy, and you just think more is gonna... Fancy restaurants, everybody kissing your rump.
[02:14:05.958 --> 02:14:10.342]  I mean, I've gotten enough celebrity, not looking for it, to know it's not fun.
[02:14:11.583 --> 02:14:12.123]  It's not fun.
[02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:16.227]  And, you know, I've got a decent little house and cars that run well.
[02:14:16.307 --> 02:14:17.368]  Why would I want more?
[02:14:17.808 --> 02:14:19.530]  Well, for them, it's just all about power.
[02:14:22.847 --> 02:14:25.692]  Just absolutely off the chart information.
[02:14:25.712 --> 02:14:29.539]  A Goldman Sachs executive has dealt a deeply embarrassing blow.
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:32.344]  Well, who do you think Naomi Prenz is?
[02:14:32.384 --> 02:14:35.610]  She worked for him as a managing director and exposed him eight years ago.
[02:14:35.650 --> 02:14:36.071]  She'd left.
[02:14:37.193 --> 02:14:39.255]  I mean, because you just can't be around people going, HA!
[02:14:39.295 --> 02:14:39.995]  Rip everybody off.
[02:14:40.015 --> 02:14:43.978]  I mean, literally, cackling and giggling.
[02:14:43.998 --> 02:14:45.319]  I've read the descriptions.
[02:14:45.359 --> 02:14:46.801]  Tapes have been released over the years.
[02:14:46.861 --> 02:14:48.442]  I mean, it's like cackling demons.
[02:14:48.682 --> 02:14:50.443]  They love wrecking everything.
[02:14:50.784 --> 02:14:51.965]  They want to wreck your life.
[02:14:52.225 --> 02:14:55.167]  They want to triple your gas prices and triple your water prices.
[02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:56.228]  They want to bankrupt you.
[02:14:56.448 --> 02:14:57.829]  They like seeing you homeless.
[02:14:58.029 --> 02:14:58.590]  They like it.
[02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:59.250]  They like it.
[02:14:59.410 --> 02:15:01.332]  They don't want a rising tide to raise all ships.
[02:15:01.352 --> 02:15:02.573]  They want to destroy the free market.
[02:15:03.894 --> 02:15:06.176]  They're blaming capitalism when they're doing the opposite of it.
[02:15:07.116 --> 02:15:15.751]  A Goldman Sachs executive has dealt the deeply embarrassing blow to the firm by quitting an open letter in which he lambasted the working environment as a toxic and destructive.
[02:15:15.791 --> 02:15:17.414]  Well, that says it lightly.
[02:15:18.576 --> 02:15:26.301]  Greg Smith, an executive director who worked with the New York-based investment bank for 12 years, claimed it is more interested in making money for itself than its clients.
[02:15:26.502 --> 02:15:27.923]  Well, yeah, they always bet against their clients.
[02:15:27.943 --> 02:15:28.503]  That's well known.
[02:15:28.543 --> 02:15:29.163]  That's what came out.
[02:15:29.804 --> 02:15:40.491]  In a scathing resignation letter published in the New York Times on Wednesday, he reveals staff have so little respect for clients they call them Muppets and talk of ripping eyeballs out.
[02:15:40.811 --> 02:15:41.132]  Well, yeah.
[02:15:41.892 --> 02:15:43.333]  And again, these are little boys.
[02:15:43.394 --> 02:15:44.194]  I've been around these people.
[02:15:44.234 --> 02:15:46.136]  Max Keiser's been one of them and exposed them.
[02:15:46.516 --> 02:15:49.079]  And, you know, got his soul back and left it all.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.521]  I mean, they call them scum.
[02:15:51.541 --> 02:15:52.682]  They call you filth.
[02:15:53.523 --> 02:15:54.624]  You know that face in the crowd?
[02:15:54.664 --> 02:16:02.011]  Guys, YouTube face in the crowd, in scene, where, you know, the famous actor
[02:16:03.311 --> 02:16:06.414]  He's sitting there, and it's the end of the show, he doesn't know the audio is still on.
[02:16:06.434 --> 02:16:09.297]  He's going, hello scum idiots!
[02:16:10.217 --> 02:16:12.760]  And the show is all about how he loves everybody and all this.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.222]  That's why I hate Angelina Jolie and all these people.
[02:16:15.502 --> 02:16:16.783]  I mean, they know they're evil.
[02:16:17.264 --> 02:16:18.625]  It's all real funny to them.
[02:16:19.426 --> 02:16:24.711]  They know it's about a murder operation in Africa, and they're going to get awards for it and be called humanitarians.
[02:16:25.831 --> 02:16:31.495]  And the guy's at the end of the TV show, he's like going, hello morons, you scum, see you next week.
[02:16:31.835 --> 02:16:33.356]  He doesn't know the audio's still going on.
[02:16:35.518 --> 02:16:38.180]  And that's what I can't stand about these people.
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:45.825]  I mean, they're so delusional that they don't care because they're making bigger bonuses while reactors everywhere are leaking.
[02:16:47.126 --> 02:16:47.726]  90 plus percent.
[02:16:49.327 --> 02:16:51.469]  I mean, listen, cancer isn't fun.
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:57.101]  And just because you giggle and are like a bad ten-year-old.
[02:16:57.681 --> 02:16:58.941]  I've been around some of these people.
[02:16:58.961 --> 02:17:08.304]  I've been on airline flights, I've run into them at events, you know, presidents of these big brokers, and they are like gibbering, giggling demons.
[02:17:08.664 --> 02:17:16.206]  And then they've always got like Lucifer types above them that are real cold and getting off on it and look everybody like they're a side of pork they want to eat or something.
[02:17:16.586 --> 02:17:21.748]  I mean, you know, you guys are like people that don't pee in the pool, you poop in the pool.
[02:17:23.061 --> 02:17:25.124]  And we're all in the pool, and you're in there pooping.
[02:17:25.605 --> 02:17:27.908]  I hate to be gross, but that's the analogy telling us how great it is.
[02:17:27.948 --> 02:17:28.729]  And man, it isn't great.
[02:17:28.749 --> 02:17:29.249]  Okay?
[02:17:31.271 --> 02:17:35.114]  Doesn't mean I'm on some high horse and I don't do things that toxify society, but you know what?
[02:17:35.134 --> 02:17:35.735]  I don't like it!
[02:17:36.215 --> 02:17:37.496]  I try to be a good person!
[02:17:37.937 --> 02:17:40.659]  Not because I'm weak, because I'm strong, scum!
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:48.926]  And I'm sick of strong people letting little cowardly pieces of trash like you control society!
[02:17:49.526 --> 02:17:52.369]  I want humans in the entire universe!
[02:17:52.609 --> 02:17:54.511]  The galaxy wide everywhere!
[02:17:55.746 --> 02:17:58.248]  I want our species to survive, you filth!
[02:17:58.748 --> 02:18:00.869]  I realize my life is short, scum!
[02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:04.712]  I want to live through the species!
[02:18:04.732 --> 02:18:08.714]  I want to continue on as my ancestors wanted us to continue on.
[02:18:08.954 --> 02:18:12.196]  You are malfunctioning cancer, and I'm sick of you!
[02:18:12.216 --> 02:18:18.180]  And I'm tired of good people being cowards and not rising up against you.
[02:18:19.201 --> 02:18:23.567]  I want to info-rise against these people and I want to hammer them down!
[02:18:24.388 --> 02:18:31.779]  I want to spread the word, as humans have done since our creation, to each other, with the truth, and defeat the enemy!
[02:18:34.813 --> 02:18:46.920]  I cannot be ruled by a bunch of arrested development scumbags who go to award ceremonies every night to feed their narcissistic, out-of-control paradigm.
[02:18:47.581 --> 02:18:53.905]  These people are a joke, but because we have blind spots to them, because we're good, inherently, in our hearts,
[02:18:55.316 --> 02:18:58.678]  We're inherently bad in our flesh, but our hearts inherently are good.
[02:18:59.159 --> 02:19:05.063]  We are blind to them because even though we're desperately wicked, we still know we want the good.
[02:19:06.684 --> 02:19:07.805]  You understand that paradox?
[02:19:08.105 --> 02:19:10.127]  We're desperately wicked, but we know the difference.
[02:19:10.627 --> 02:19:11.588]  And we choose good.
[02:19:11.648 --> 02:19:12.288]  It's the choice.
[02:19:12.769 --> 02:19:16.171]  These people have chosen to be divorced from reality.
[02:19:18.313 --> 02:19:19.373]  You can go read the whole article.
[02:19:19.393 --> 02:19:20.894]  We've got it linked at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:21.755 --> 02:19:22.676]  I'm coughing a lot today.
[02:19:22.756 --> 02:19:24.097]  The oak just hit.
[02:19:25.523 --> 02:19:28.805]  It's not really like cedar where it gives me a really bad headache, it just makes me cough a lot.
[02:19:30.206 --> 02:19:32.447]  Uh, so the oak, oak are going crazy right now.
[02:19:32.888 --> 02:19:34.449]  Just the start of it, so I'm coughing a bit.
[02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:35.850]  Alright, I'm gonna try to shut up.
[02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:37.731]  See, I just went to one article and spent ten minutes on it.
[02:19:37.751 --> 02:19:38.151]  I gotta come back.
[02:19:38.191 --> 02:19:39.512]  I mean, there's like over a hundred here.
[02:19:39.532 --> 02:19:40.393]  They're all off the charts.
[02:19:40.433 --> 02:19:41.433]  I gotta try to hit something.
[02:19:42.154 --> 02:19:43.014]  Who knows what I'll hit.
[02:19:43.034 --> 02:19:48.218]  I, I, I... We're gonna be right back, but I mean, it's just... Ripping off old ladies, man.
[02:19:48.298 --> 02:19:49.218]  It's, it's just, you know what?
[02:19:49.238 --> 02:19:51.560]  And they've got all the laws written so they can do it.
[02:19:53.677 --> 02:19:57.889]  And they own the big private prisons with the cops cramming people in it for their profit.
[02:19:57.929 --> 02:19:58.852]  I mean, it's gotta end.
[02:19:58.892 --> 02:19:59.775]  These people gotta go down.
[02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:07.744]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:20:08.004 --> 02:20:25.477]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:29.820]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:31.641]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:20:31.821 --> 02:20:39.606]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:20:39.907 --> 02:20:46.131]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:47.212]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:20:47.432 --> 02:20:48.192]  It's incredible.
[02:20:48.312 --> 02:20:57.258]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:20:57.438 --> 02:20:59.320]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:02.341]  Are you having trouble paying your mortgage?
[02:21:02.641 --> 02:21:05.502]  Maybe your mortgage loan is upside down or in foreclosure.
[02:21:05.762 --> 02:21:07.742]  Maybe the bank already foreclosed on you.
[02:21:07.982 --> 02:21:10.683]  Don't sit around being a victim of bank fraud.
[02:21:10.943 --> 02:21:11.683]  Fight back.
[02:21:11.964 --> 02:21:14.184]  We have the tools to help you fight back.
[02:21:14.364 --> 02:21:15.084]  Here's how.
[02:21:15.345 --> 02:21:19.486]  Go to inspectoraudit.com and click on the GCN radio special.
[02:21:19.706 --> 02:21:21.026]  Order a summary audit.
[02:21:21.186 --> 02:21:23.267]  Find the real truth about your loan.
[02:21:23.647 --> 02:21:26.969]  Maybe, like me, you'll find your bank loan was paid off already.
[02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:31.051]  Maybe, like me, you'll find your bank defrauded you at the closing.
[02:21:31.411 --> 02:21:34.033]  And maybe, like me, you will go after them.
[02:21:34.393 --> 02:21:39.136]  Did you know 78% of home loans in the last 10 years violated consumer credit laws?
[02:21:39.276 --> 02:21:41.757]  We should not let the banks get away with this fraud.
[02:21:41.977 --> 02:21:45.879]  Go to inspectoraudit.com and click on the GCN radio special.
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:50.422]  Order a summary audit today and find the truth about your mortgage loan.
[02:21:50.582 --> 02:21:52.243]  That's inspectoraudit.com.
[02:21:52.463 --> 02:21:53.024]  Or call 855-373-4948.
[02:21:53.064 --> 02:21:53.264]  That's 1-855-373-4948.
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:07.963]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:22:08.403 --> 02:22:10.144]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:22:10.284 --> 02:22:13.465]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:22:13.806 --> 02:22:20.989]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:25.492]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.

[02:24:01.618 --> 02:24:06.742]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.422 --> 02:24:09.704]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:17.475 --> 02:24:20.677]  Here's a report that got top-linked on Drudge today.
[02:24:21.238 --> 02:24:22.058]  Major U.S.
[02:24:22.218 --> 02:24:24.520]  airport to evict TSA screeners.
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:30.944]  Orlando Sanford International could prompt stampede of other opt-outs.
[02:24:31.925 --> 02:24:34.166]  Yeah, how do you have federal goons that are grabbing everybody?
[02:24:34.607 --> 02:24:38.710]  And we have a photo there of them actually grabbing people right between the crotch and squeezing.
[02:24:39.890 --> 02:24:44.674]  One of America's busiest airports, Orlando Sanford International, has announced
[02:24:46.129 --> 02:24:55.693]  It will opt out of using TSA workers to screen passengers, a move which threatens the highly unpopular federal agency's role in other airports across the nation.
[02:24:56.233 --> 02:24:57.714]  People are like, well, now it's going to be private.
[02:24:57.734 --> 02:24:59.254]  Well, at least they'll get pressure put on them.
[02:24:59.295 --> 02:25:06.718]  And, you know, when it's an old man they see that has all four of his arms and legs blown off, come flying every week, they'll know and let the guy through.
[02:25:06.738 --> 02:25:09.919]  You know, who are the feds to say how all this is supposed to be done?
[02:25:09.959 --> 02:25:11.980]  Or microwave oven machines, the rest of it.
[02:25:12.833 --> 02:25:20.977]  The president of the airport said Tuesday he would apply again to use private operators to screen passengers using federal standards and oversight.
[02:25:21.097 --> 02:25:22.618]  Why are there federal standards over it?
[02:25:22.958 --> 02:25:24.219]  Get the feds out, man.
[02:25:24.639 --> 02:25:26.660]  They're a bunch of crooks that ship guns into Mexico.
[02:25:27.681 --> 02:25:29.382]  And it goes on from there.
[02:25:29.442 --> 02:25:34.825]  So it's not perfect, but it shows that the pressure is starting to work, starting to happen.
[02:25:36.209 --> 02:25:38.330]  We heard suicide attack bid on U.S.
[02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:39.311]  Defense Secretary.
[02:25:39.331 --> 02:25:43.093]  It turns out a car burst into flames.
[02:25:43.133 --> 02:25:46.275]  Sounds like a staged event, the fact that it wasn't a big car bomb when his plane landed.
[02:25:46.956 --> 02:25:48.797]  Who knows, but it just sounds like stuff they do.
[02:25:50.478 --> 02:25:54.480]  Also, Texas Planned Parenthood CEO arrested for indecent exposure.
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:56.462]  Hmm, isn't that just special?
[02:25:57.942 --> 02:26:00.824]  Planned Parenthood is a eugenics organization, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:01.365 --> 02:26:02.545]  Plain and simple.
[02:26:03.506 --> 02:26:04.266]  And it goes on.
[02:26:05.843 --> 02:26:08.466]  Uh, to go over exactly what's happening on that front.
[02:26:10.588 --> 02:26:17.294]  As I told you this was coming, Angelina Jolie in court as ICC finds Congo warlord guilty of using child soldiers.
[02:26:17.975 --> 02:26:21.278]  So now they don't, it's just a perfect way to invade whoever you want.
[02:26:21.298 --> 02:26:28.886]  And of course CBS News reports they've entered resolutions in the Congress to launch a continent-wide invasion, quote, anywhere.
[02:26:31.331 --> 02:26:32.332]  To protect civilians.
[02:26:32.352 --> 02:26:33.252]  So it's just a blank check.
[02:26:33.272 --> 02:26:34.673]  We're going to invade to protect civilians.
[02:26:34.693 --> 02:26:39.715]  Yeah, yeah, that's what the globalists use our military for, is to protect civilians, just like Libya and Iraq.
[02:26:39.735 --> 02:26:40.876]  Sure, sure, mm-hmm.
[02:26:41.516 --> 02:26:45.438]  The official UN policy is to reduce population, so is the US policy.
[02:26:45.858 --> 02:26:50.561]  Under State Department memorandum 200, go read it, go read it, go read it, go read it!
[02:26:51.001 --> 02:26:52.441]  Don't just go, oh, he says that.
[02:26:52.502 --> 02:26:53.602]  No, that's what it is.
[02:26:54.182 --> 02:26:58.865]  Our government, our military, is a engine of wickedness.
[02:26:59.901 --> 02:27:09.808]  Our troops are good people, on average, but the mission is about drugs and child kidnapping and weapon sales and evil.
[02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:16.173]  10% roughly of world opium supply came out of Afghanistan pre 9-11.
[02:27:16.733 --> 02:27:27.561]  After the liberation of it, where they just arrested some of the Taliban forces that warned them about Al-Qaeda, that's actually who they arrested, who knew it was all a set up, go look it up.
[02:27:28.621 --> 02:27:31.808]  It's now 92 to 93 percent of world opium supply.
[02:27:32.409 --> 02:27:35.015]  A 13 to 14-fold, depending on which number you look at, increase.
[02:27:36.197 --> 02:27:37.420]  Just side issue.
[02:27:39.249 --> 02:27:46.412]  But the whole Coney 2012 thing that I told you would be used to launch a bunch of new wars, it's now imploding, but they don't care.
[02:27:46.432 --> 02:27:48.773]  It's now coming out that it's all a fraud, but they don't care.
[02:27:48.813 --> 02:27:50.994]  It's just, there's a boogeyman somewhere in Africa.
[02:27:51.014 --> 02:27:54.875]  It's like saying, Al-Qaeda might attack, so we gotta set up checkpoints on every highway.
[02:27:55.435 --> 02:27:59.097]  There might be a bad man somewhere, so you gotta have your house searched.
[02:28:00.234 --> 02:28:01.195]  And the U.N.
[02:28:01.635 --> 02:28:05.598]  and AFRICOM are openly slaughtering people, especially the U.N.
[02:28:06.298 --> 02:28:08.480]  all over Africa on record.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:14.004]  And Paul Watson and Kurt have all written countless articles where it's just admitted the U.N.
[02:28:14.044 --> 02:28:15.025]  is slaughtering people.
[02:28:15.365 --> 02:28:16.245]  It's like, well, the U.N.'
[02:28:16.225 --> 02:28:22.330]  's investigating why they're, yeah, their peacekeepers helped the mercenaries killed a few thousand here and there to get them off the land.
[02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:23.370]  We don't know why.
[02:28:23.851 --> 02:28:24.651]  Never mind that.
[02:28:25.132 --> 02:28:26.773]  Angelina Jolie loves kids.
[02:28:26.793 --> 02:28:28.754]  Look, here's a video of her feeding them.
[02:28:28.854 --> 02:28:29.515]  I mean, come on.
[02:28:30.461 --> 02:28:33.003]  And she calls for all these wars too, isn't she a nice lady?
[02:28:33.444 --> 02:28:47.536]  When she's not doing weird rituals with blood and emitting it and wearing blood ampules around her neck with satanic runes all over her body and admits she's into weird death cults and making movies about the Illuminati and constantly playing the part of witches and she's a good person!
[02:28:48.577 --> 02:28:52.179]  He went over there to help those little black kids, because she's a nice person.
[02:28:52.199 --> 02:28:56.062]  Of course, I can look right into her and see what she is, but I don't just go off that.
[02:28:56.442 --> 02:28:57.863]  I then go actually do the research.
[02:28:58.343 --> 02:29:00.204]  And she is a abomination.
[02:29:00.244 --> 02:29:02.226]  And yes, I mean it when I say, arrest her.
[02:29:06.789 --> 02:29:07.329]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:07.569 --> 02:29:09.850]  See, I'm done playing games with these people.
[02:29:10.111 --> 02:29:10.451]  I'm done.
[02:29:11.974 --> 02:29:12.775]  And I know you're done.
[02:29:13.415 --> 02:29:15.777]  Now, when I come back, I gotta move even quicker through news here.
[02:29:16.237 --> 02:29:19.480]  Gun shops cite Obama re-election fears as sales surge.
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:24.784]  There's also major studies showing the public believes that, quote, major catastrophe or collapse is imminent.
[02:29:25.464 --> 02:29:26.305]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:29:26.325 --> 02:29:27.886]  It's gonna be just a slow unraveling.
[02:29:28.206 --> 02:29:30.488]  There could be some bigger potholes in the way.
[02:29:31.789 --> 02:29:33.090]  And they don't trust the government.
[02:29:34.195 --> 02:29:38.718]  Yes, the previous records have been doubled, and then doubled again, and then doubled again.
[02:29:38.758 --> 02:29:40.459]  There's just, I mean, I've gone to gun stores.
[02:29:40.479 --> 02:29:41.199]  They're almost out of everything.
[02:29:41.219 --> 02:29:42.820]  There's just snatching, ammo's gone.
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.002]  People are just, ah, what happened to the government?
[02:29:45.062 --> 02:29:45.262]  Evil!
[02:29:45.722 --> 02:29:49.164]  It's like, because deep down, the human survival instinct knows we're in deep trouble.
[02:29:49.865 --> 02:29:50.745]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.246 --> 02:29:52.847]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.767 --> 02:29:56.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.455 --> 02:30:04.677]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.997 --> 02:30:05.618]  Number one.
[02:30:05.918 --> 02:30:09.080]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:09.920]  Number two.
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:14.763]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.103 --> 02:30:15.543]  It's true.
[02:30:15.843 --> 02:30:20.386]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.706 --> 02:30:21.227]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.527 --> 02:30:24.810]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:28.833]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.034 --> 02:30:29.574]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.834 --> 02:30:32.196]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.597 --> 02:30:35.940]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:40.965]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.185 --> 02:30:45.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:50.274]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.434 --> 02:30:51.975]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.215 --> 02:30:56.820]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.130 --> 02:31:05.753]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.073 --> 02:31:14.200]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:18.983]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:19.584 --> 02:31:30.413]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.013 --> 02:31:40.036]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:40.536 --> 02:31:45.598]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:45.958 --> 02:31:53.121]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.441 --> 02:31:56.202]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:00.538 --> 02:32:01.539]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:01.599 --> 02:32:06.663]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:07.103 --> 02:32:11.587]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:11.927 --> 02:32:18.292]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:32:18.772 --> 02:32:29.263]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:30.003 --> 02:32:34.127]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:32:34.468 --> 02:32:37.471]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:32:37.831 --> 02:32:40.494]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:40.714 --> 02:32:41.875]  Now that's results.
[02:32:42.295 --> 02:32:48.721]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:54.426]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:32:54.827 --> 02:32:57.049]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:32:57.369 --> 02:32:58.951]  Infowarsteam.com
[02:33:07.899 --> 02:33:16.462]  Once the horse leaves the barn on World War 3, open world government, once the AI gets out of the bottle,
[02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:46.411]  Once that genie is out, once they test an antimatter weapon and things don't go right, which the Air Force admits they've had for a decade, but details remain classified.
[02:33:46.431 --> 02:33:48.812]  It's always details are classified.
[02:33:48.832 --> 02:33:50.572]  They want everybody to know they've got it.
[02:33:53.293 --> 02:34:02.877]  And I look at how the elite spend all their time trying to dumb down and poison and hurt the general public, instead of being in control of what they're doing.
[02:34:04.215 --> 02:34:06.516]  It just shows that, again, it's a paradox.
[02:34:06.536 --> 02:34:08.237]  They're in control to a great extent.
[02:34:08.577 --> 02:34:15.400]  They're trying to set up world government, but they're not even in control of themselves, and all the evil they're doing is blowing back on them.
[02:34:17.842 --> 02:34:19.362]  Because they're not in full control.
[02:34:23.084 --> 02:34:25.825]  They're control freaks who are actually endangering everybody.
[02:34:28.066 --> 02:34:30.688]  And lusting after every power that's out there so they
[02:34:31.778 --> 02:34:35.702]  They haphazardly test and try to develop every weapon system you can imagine.
[02:34:41.387 --> 02:34:43.089]  So that nobody else gets it first.
[02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:46.272]  But then they're endangering everyone by doing that.
[02:34:46.292 --> 02:34:51.597]  I mean, what a disgusting, pathetic elite.
[02:34:53.134 --> 02:35:07.516]  That wants to put poison in the food and water to give people all sorts of degenerative diseases and kill people early and wanting to dumb down people in the schools on record just so you can control everybody?
[02:35:09.877 --> 02:35:13.658]  I mean, that is... wrap your mind around how pathetic that is.
[02:35:14.218 --> 02:35:15.638]  But then I think about the general public.
[02:35:16.258 --> 02:35:21.679]  A good 30% of people I run into are mad when anybody else does well.
[02:35:23.243 --> 02:35:24.624]  Hate people that are good looking.
[02:35:25.404 --> 02:35:26.765]  Hate people that have a talent.
[02:35:29.906 --> 02:35:31.387]  Are totally materialistic.
[02:35:34.428 --> 02:35:36.349]  And are just really bad news.
[02:35:37.509 --> 02:35:39.690]  And that's where the globalists get their minions from.
[02:35:43.872 --> 02:35:47.334]  And we gotta realize folks, you know, good people need to start learning to fight.
[02:35:48.919 --> 02:35:53.403]  I know a lot of good people are like, well, just ignore it, move along, you know, that scum isn't worth it.
[02:35:53.463 --> 02:35:54.984]  No, you've got to route out the scum.
[02:35:57.706 --> 02:35:58.887]  You've got to show them their place.
[02:35:58.907 --> 02:36:07.294]  Let me mention a few other headlines, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:36:10.437 --> 02:36:11.238]  Look at the gun news.
[02:36:11.398 --> 02:36:14.841]  Record gun sales everywhere, and I saw a couple articles this week, I never got to.
[02:36:16.155 --> 02:36:19.116]  Where they're arresting people again that draw guns in art class.
[02:36:21.076 --> 02:36:23.917]  They don't say, oh, I'm drawing a gun like I have at home, I'm gonna come kill you.
[02:36:23.977 --> 02:36:26.438]  No, it's just, oh, look, I drew a picture of a superhero with a gun.
[02:36:26.458 --> 02:36:27.438]  I mean, what's all over TV?
[02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:28.738]  What did we all draw as children?
[02:36:28.758 --> 02:36:35.420]  I actually dug up some drawings that one of my uncles did.
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:36.620]  I've got them framed out here.
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:38.941]  It's like soldiers on a battlefield shooting at each other.
[02:36:39.081 --> 02:36:39.621]  It's funny.
[02:36:40.781 --> 02:36:41.942]  It's what all little boys draw.
[02:36:41.962 --> 02:36:42.942]  Well, now you go to jail for that.
[02:36:43.749 --> 02:36:46.331]  Well, it goes one further in the thought crime.
[02:36:48.493 --> 02:37:02.623]  John Wilkes Booth bobbleheads pulled from Gettysburg gift shop because he had a pistol in his hand and that's not appropriate at a national park for someone to be sold with a gun in their hand.
[02:37:04.544 --> 02:37:06.626]  And the park service is very apologetic.
[02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:10.350]  Not making that up.
[02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:10.671]  Here it is.
[02:37:11.051 --> 02:37:14.073]  John Wilkes Booth bobblehead pulls from Gettysburg shop.
[02:37:14.373 --> 02:37:16.074]  I think I've been to the Gettysburg gift shop.
[02:37:16.094 --> 02:37:16.714]  In fact, I have.
[02:37:16.974 --> 02:37:20.597]  I think my mother got me a little gold, gold-colored bronze.
[02:37:21.677 --> 02:37:22.017]  She did.
[02:37:22.138 --> 02:37:23.899]  Pencil sharpener that's a cannon.
[02:37:24.339 --> 02:37:25.239]  I guess you can't have that.
[02:37:25.259 --> 02:37:26.300]  In fact, where is that?
[02:37:27.141 --> 02:37:29.602]  Saw that a few years ago in, out in the garage.
[02:37:33.024 --> 02:37:35.826]  I mean, every one of those Civil War parks I've been to, they got cannons.
[02:37:40.413 --> 02:37:43.858]  See, there's no lobby to protect the image of a gun.
[02:37:44.379 --> 02:37:45.320]  So they're banning that.
[02:37:45.841 --> 02:37:49.205]  And when you can ban the image, you can then ban the real thing.
[02:37:49.245 --> 02:37:49.886]  See how they do that?
[02:37:51.749 --> 02:37:53.391]  And they are coming after the ammo, too.
[02:37:53.431 --> 02:37:55.694]  That's a big problem we face.
[02:37:56.701 --> 02:38:05.286]  Remember last year, the Energy Secretary said, we are going to shut down massive numbers of coal power plants that aren't owned by the insiders to increase your prices.
[02:38:06.166 --> 02:38:09.188]  Well, he then also said, we do, we like higher gas prices.
[02:38:09.228 --> 02:38:11.529]  That's, that's good for the environment.
[02:38:11.549 --> 02:38:14.911]  And they said, this recession is good, lowers carbon footprint.
[02:38:14.931 --> 02:38:19.474]  In fact, guys, just type in recession good or depression good to lower carbon footprint.
[02:38:20.274 --> 02:38:25.317]  If you forget that, we can show folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv or if you're a radio listener, just go search engine it.
[02:38:26.857 --> 02:38:32.304]  But now he's been questioned in Congress by Senator Mike Lee about it.
[02:38:32.324 --> 02:38:41.015]  And he said, since I walked in the door as Secretary of Energy, I've been doing everything in our power, in our powers, to do what we can to reduce gas prices.
[02:38:42.077 --> 02:38:43.799]  Senator Chu told the Senate hearing.
[02:38:46.032 --> 02:38:50.096]  They went on to say, so you no longer share the view about it's good for the earth, and it goes on.
[02:38:50.356 --> 02:38:52.418]  See, they just call it good for the earth.
[02:38:52.818 --> 02:39:03.347]  I mean, I remember the city council a few months ago said, yeah, there'll be a 20 to 80% increase depending on what type of residential or business user you are, or non-profit user like churches.
[02:39:03.367 --> 02:39:10.194]  And of course, energy's cheaper than never been in Texas, all these power plants.
[02:39:11.144 --> 02:39:15.090]  And they got on the news and they said, yeah, we're going to charge you 80% more for the earth.
[02:39:15.932 --> 02:39:18.195]  No, it's for multinationals ripping us off.
[02:39:18.476 --> 02:39:19.077]  That's who it's for.
[02:39:20.532 --> 02:39:27.276]  But, it's like the Goldman Sachs emails and memos are out where they call their customers scum, idiots, let's rip them off, ha ha ha, the highest levels.
[02:39:27.656 --> 02:39:32.399]  I mean, it's like, we're going to rip them off and double and triple their water and power prices like we've done in the third world.
[02:39:32.619 --> 02:39:33.179]  What do we call it?
[02:39:33.199 --> 02:39:34.180]  Tell them it's for the earth.
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:38.162]  And they tell the trendies that, the trendies go, rip me off, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh.
[02:39:38.502 --> 02:39:40.423]  I mean, it's just like, because they get into it.
[02:39:40.743 --> 02:39:45.646]  You can tell a trendy, hey, here they are ripping you off, and they get this glazed look, do this little, I don't want to say effeminate.
[02:39:46.126 --> 02:39:47.007]  It's not fair to women.
[02:39:47.187 --> 02:39:48.368]  But these men do like this little,
[02:39:49.128 --> 02:39:54.351]  I can't even do it, it's like a Nelly little thing, and they go... In fact, guys, cue it up.
[02:39:54.431 --> 02:39:57.073]  I told you I wanted it, then you got it, then I didn't use it.
[02:39:58.634 --> 02:40:01.596]  The Kony 2012, do a screening in your area video.
[02:40:02.016 --> 02:40:06.439]  Now, if you're a radio listener, and then I'm going to your calls, you cannot understand the magnitude.
[02:40:06.459 --> 02:40:10.421]  This is not the main Kony 2012 with hundreds of millions of views or whatever, total.
[02:40:11.182 --> 02:40:12.543]  This is one of their promo ones.
[02:40:13.365 --> 02:40:15.705]  Before they launched it, this is all again government-run.
[02:40:16.226 --> 02:40:17.666]  It's now coming out as we knew.
[02:40:17.686 --> 02:40:19.346]  I mean, I've watched it until it was government-run.
[02:40:20.066 --> 02:40:27.367]  Now, it's adults, who look like they're about 30 years old, acting like they're 5, talking to college students, because it's a new thing.
[02:40:27.908 --> 02:40:31.368]  Not just being in a narcoleptic state, or being cowardly, or having a potbelly.
[02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:34.329]  I mean, the average trendy resembles a pedophile.
[02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:35.049]  It's like the style.
[02:40:35.849 --> 02:40:41.370]  Not only is that what's going on, chicken-neck weakness is like a god now.
[02:40:42.842 --> 02:40:47.204]  And being totally passive and being a huge jellyfish slacker who looks like a fried egg in a chair.
[02:40:47.985 --> 02:40:50.086]  That is the culture of this, okay?
[02:40:50.346 --> 02:40:51.987]  The worship of being destroyed.
[02:40:52.427 --> 02:40:54.248]  Literally, I've now discovered the secrets of it.
[02:40:55.228 --> 02:40:56.309]  And it's a cult everywhere.
[02:40:56.329 --> 02:40:57.309]  It's South by Southwest.
[02:40:57.329 --> 02:40:59.010]  They're just hordes of these people.
[02:40:59.711 --> 02:41:03.252]  They look like adults in diapers or something, you know, just toddling along.
[02:41:03.773 --> 02:41:07.294]  I mean, spiritually, it's a side issue.
[02:41:08.755 --> 02:41:10.696]  It's incredibly evil, though.
[02:41:11.156 --> 02:41:11.356]  Again,
[02:41:15.744 --> 02:41:17.933]  If you're already a listener... In fact, what's the title of it?
[02:41:17.974 --> 02:41:18.275]  I forget.
[02:41:18.295 --> 02:41:20.043]  It's something like... Have a Kony 2012 Screening?
[02:41:23.806 --> 02:41:24.926]  Book a screening for Kony 2012.
[02:41:25.006 --> 02:41:25.787]  It's on YouTube.
[02:41:26.787 --> 02:41:29.407]  And if you're a radio listener, you'll just hear the voices.
[02:41:29.647 --> 02:41:37.889]  But if you're a TV viewer at PrisonPlanet.tv, they actually jump up and down and go, oh my gosh, so trendy!
[02:41:39.570 --> 02:41:42.051]  And we're gonna get Kony, gonna get Kony!
[02:41:42.431 --> 02:41:43.951]  And you can tell they're government operatives.
[02:41:43.991 --> 02:41:45.311]  They've got, like, evil in their eyes.
[02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:46.132]  You know, hardcore.
[02:41:46.152 --> 02:41:47.212]  I mean, their real spirit is...
[02:41:56.438 --> 02:42:04.704]  But on the surface... And just cutting this room full of, you know, trendies all swarming around like piranhas.
[02:42:05.782 --> 02:42:08.504]  But again, it's that cover of the Armored Warmock.
[02:42:08.684 --> 02:42:12.366]  It has this cover of, I'm friendly, I'm nice, eww, eww.
[02:42:13.087 --> 02:42:26.436]  And it's going after the young people who are in a narcoleptic state, are attracted like Maws the Flame to someone going, uh, uh, uh, uh, war, trendy, invade, uh, help the children, uh, uh.
[02:42:26.896 --> 02:42:30.939]  And I mean, and I'm like, and I started watching more of their videos, and it gets worse.
[02:42:31.319 --> 02:42:33.641]  I mean, I'm not joking, folks.
[02:42:36.365 --> 02:42:43.231]  I mean, and everyone's wearing, like, pink and little green, non-threatening, you know, colors, all... And this is what we face.
[02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:50.797]  So, this is for college students, and this is what college, this is what men look like now, on average.
[02:42:51.617 --> 02:42:57.502]  In fact, now I used to bash men that are all into being big and muscular with tattoos and black on and going... Now I get it!
[02:42:57.742 --> 02:42:59.304]  You don't want to be like these people!
[02:43:00.345 --> 02:43:02.585]  Okay, I used to get mad at guys trying to act tough.
[02:43:02.645 --> 02:43:03.546]  No, no, that's good!
[02:43:03.606 --> 02:43:04.006]  Do that!
[02:43:04.806 --> 02:43:10.427]  In fact, I think I'm gonna just go all out with cut-off sleeves and drive a big, fast car and be like, raaah!
[02:43:10.687 --> 02:43:11.967]  Because, I mean, I'm starting to get it.
[02:43:12.528 --> 02:43:15.228]  Men are running to that because they see the armies.
[02:43:15.608 --> 02:43:27.471]  At South by Southwest, you go down there, it's literally men in pastels, and part of the effeminate thing is they have these little wispy beards and, like, bandanas, and they're all walking around bending their wrists, going, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[02:43:27.771 --> 02:43:28.691]  I mean, I don't know what it is.
[02:43:30.543 --> 02:43:32.684]  No, there's men everywhere wearing dresses, I'm telling you!
[02:43:32.744 --> 02:43:35.305]  It's like, they're just like, New World Order, slaughter me, please!
[02:43:35.325 --> 02:43:40.088]  And the New World Order's like, act like a jellyfish coward and giggle at all reality.
[02:43:40.248 --> 02:43:41.549]  They're like, yes, yes!
[02:43:42.549 --> 02:43:51.353]  Anyways... Anyways, but the controller-level ones are just like, know what they're doing.
[02:43:51.373 --> 02:43:55.576]  Alright, let's... Again, if you can't see the video as a radio listener, it doesn't have the same effect.
[02:43:55.916 --> 02:43:56.596]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:43:59.337 --> 02:43:59.718]  No, listen...
[02:44:04.409 --> 02:44:11.092]  Ladies and gentlemen and babies of 2012, I don't know if you've heard, but this is the year this war has to come to an end.
[02:44:11.192 --> 02:44:17.555]  You're watching this because you've heard of Kony, and you're wondering what you can do to help finally bring this war to an end.
[02:44:17.575 --> 02:44:18.315]  Oh my gosh!
[02:44:18.535 --> 02:44:19.415]  Oh my gosh!
[02:44:19.435 --> 02:44:19.976]  1,500 screenings.
[02:44:19.996 --> 02:44:19.976]  1,500.
[02:44:20.096 --> 02:44:21.116]  That's how many.
[02:44:21.196 --> 02:44:21.817]  Do the rest.
[02:44:27.839 --> 02:44:28.920]  Oh, look at him!
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:29.120]  Oh, ah!
[02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:30.861]  Now watch, right here.
[02:44:30.881 --> 02:44:32.802]  He starts hopping around.
[02:44:46.631 --> 02:44:49.693]  We have been working around the clock to bring you a movie.
[02:44:49.773 --> 02:44:50.353]  It's a show.
[02:44:50.453 --> 02:44:51.234]  Oh my gosh.
[02:44:51.314 --> 02:44:54.995]  You're a place of worship in your classroom, at your work.
[02:44:55.015 --> 02:44:55.276]  7-Eleven.
[02:44:55.296 --> 02:44:55.656]  7-Eleven.
[02:44:55.676 --> 02:44:55.716]  619-562-2799.
[02:44:55.736 --> 02:44:56.116]  Here he does.
[02:44:56.176 --> 02:44:57.357]  He does the hopping dance.
[02:44:57.377 --> 02:44:57.437]  619-562-2799.
[02:44:57.557 --> 02:44:58.137]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:11.165 --> 02:45:12.906]  I mean, this is for adults!
[02:45:13.707 --> 02:45:14.828]  This is Sesame Street!
[02:45:14.848 --> 02:45:14.888]  Oh!
[02:45:20.836 --> 02:45:22.898]  That's an ad product placement.
[02:45:23.038 --> 02:45:23.399]  Oh my gosh!
[02:45:23.419 --> 02:45:23.479]  Oh!
[02:45:23.499 --> 02:45:24.099]  Oh, so easy!
[02:45:24.119 --> 02:45:25.521]  We're gonna launch a huge war!
[02:45:25.561 --> 02:45:28.364]  Oh my gosh, African white carnage at the... Hello!
[02:45:41.482 --> 02:45:42.622]  Oh, it's propaganda!
[02:45:42.682 --> 02:45:46.004]  Because we've got the State Department and all the stars behind us!
[02:45:46.024 --> 02:45:46.744]  And Angelina Jolie!
[02:45:47.144 --> 02:45:47.824]  And Georgia Clinton-y!
[02:46:06.271 --> 02:46:08.172]  For the future, step into it, okay?
[02:46:08.272 --> 02:46:09.072]  Step into it.
[02:46:09.272 --> 02:46:09.472]  Peace.
[02:46:09.953 --> 02:46:11.893]  Step into it, let me mind control you.
[02:46:12.213 --> 02:46:14.234]  Let me do some effeminate stuff now.
[02:46:14.554 --> 02:46:16.335]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[02:46:17.015 --> 02:46:20.037]  Pentagon's like, how do we get the jellyfish into total war?
[02:46:20.757 --> 02:46:21.877]  Dance around and prance.
[02:46:22.378 --> 02:46:26.799]  You can see black ops guys are just sitting back, cold-blooded, this'll work well on them, good.
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:29.480]  Increase dosages in water immediately.
[02:46:30.001 --> 02:46:32.802]  Send out trendy, trendies to destroy them.
[02:46:32.822 --> 02:46:35.283]  There's nothing, I mean, there's nothing the trendies won't buy.
[02:46:36.454 --> 02:46:37.355]  Oh my gosh, help me.
[02:46:37.875 --> 02:46:40.678]  Folks, if you couldn't see this, I mean, this was prancing.
[02:46:41.158 --> 02:46:42.459]  Was it as bad as I said, guys?
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:44.081]  It was worse.
[02:46:44.481 --> 02:46:48.945]  And now listen, Nemo just ran in here with stacks of articles.
[02:46:50.246 --> 02:46:56.912]  NATO, Australia, England, France, NORTHCOM troops are being dispatched for AFRICOM.
[02:46:57.433 --> 02:46:59.595]  The invasion of Africa is beginning.
[02:47:00.635 --> 02:47:01.895]  Has nothing to do with coning.
[02:47:02.536 --> 02:47:07.017]  It's about seizing land, fighting indigenous groups that are being forced off.
[02:47:07.037 --> 02:47:08.377]  Because it's all in the news, the U.N.'
[02:47:08.357 --> 02:47:09.638]  's just in there gunning people down.
[02:47:10.318 --> 02:47:15.679]  But again, they've got guys prancing around going, uh, uh, liberal, and Angelina Jolie going, uh, children.
[02:47:16.439 --> 02:47:17.340]  Again, that's the cover.
[02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:22.161]  Imagine the tank ramming the Branch Davidians going, this is not an assault, please come out, we are your friends.
[02:47:22.361 --> 02:47:23.421]  They come out, they shoot them.
[02:47:24.002 --> 02:47:24.682]  It's the same thing.
[02:47:25.382 --> 02:47:31.844]  I mean, imagine a military that first deploys people hopping around in pink shirts saying, it's a perfect deal.
[02:47:31.864 --> 02:47:34.044]  Like, oh, this is a non-threatening.
[02:47:34.785 --> 02:47:36.425]  That's just like one of those fish.
[02:47:36.465 --> 02:47:39.106]  Guys, pull up the lantern fish.
[02:47:39.706 --> 02:47:41.286]  It's at 2,000 feet and deeper.
[02:47:41.827 --> 02:47:44.007]  And it has that little lamp that looks like a tasty.
[02:47:45.448 --> 02:47:48.168]  No, a lamprey is one that attaches and is parasitic.
[02:47:48.548 --> 02:47:49.969]  It's a lantern fish.
[02:47:50.987 --> 02:48:05.353]  And it's got big, giant teeth, but in the total darkness, there's a lot of little, um, you know, glowing crustaceans and things that fish eat, so you think you're getting a big, juicy, non-threatening little goblet, but really, it's the lantern hanging, and that's what Coney is.
[02:48:06.274 --> 02:48:06.494]  Oh!
[02:48:07.294 --> 02:48:07.494]  Oh!
[02:48:07.754 --> 02:48:15.458]  And it's like... And it's trendy, liberal, Angelina Jolie!
[02:48:15.998 --> 02:48:20.320]  I mean, that's what we're dealing with here, and I'm sick of it, and I'm calling you out, scum!
[02:48:25.134 --> 02:48:26.375]  I cannot stand these people.
[02:48:26.395 --> 02:48:27.616]  Did you find the lantern fish?
[02:48:28.436 --> 02:48:28.777]  Watch this.
[02:48:28.817 --> 02:48:29.257]  I'll show you.
[02:48:30.758 --> 02:48:31.499]  Lantern fish.
[02:48:31.799 --> 02:48:34.721]  Lantern fish.
[02:48:34.761 --> 02:48:39.805]  You can also Google horrors of the deep.
[02:48:41.386 --> 02:48:41.807]  I found it.
[02:48:41.907 --> 02:48:42.307]  Here it is.
[02:48:42.467 --> 02:48:42.727]  Boom.
[02:48:43.668 --> 02:48:44.889]  Just show lantern.
[02:48:45.930 --> 02:48:46.971]  Lantern fish.
[02:48:48.692 --> 02:48:49.873]  The ultimate in trendiness.
[02:48:50.606 --> 02:48:52.206]  Oh, look, Connie 2012!
[02:48:52.927 --> 02:48:55.748]  Oh, look at the little Connie 2012, a little glowing.
[02:48:56.228 --> 02:48:57.808]  You can't see him right there.
[02:48:58.148 --> 02:49:01.129]  New World Order Rockefeller eugenics operation.
[02:49:01.449 --> 02:49:04.250]  In the dark, all you see is, ah!
[02:49:05.010 --> 02:49:08.951]  Angelina Jolie, right up, shining in the darkness.
[02:49:09.391 --> 02:49:12.913]  Looks like a little fish, he sees that, and says, I'll just swim over and eat that.
[02:49:15.133 --> 02:49:17.715]  Oh, the AFRICOM is coming.
[02:49:18.196 --> 02:49:20.097]  Loving, loving, loving.
[02:49:20.477 --> 02:49:22.099]  You can do it, stop Kony.
[02:49:22.299 --> 02:49:26.202]  You know, Kony's like a little skeleton on the bottom, hadn't been seen in forever, little tiny nothing.
[02:49:26.522 --> 02:49:29.004]  But it's like, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna fight.
[02:49:29.304 --> 02:49:34.108]  Oh, and then there's a little... Oh boy, I said I'd go to your phone calls and I'm out of control now, aren't I?
[02:49:35.822 --> 02:49:38.024]  Matthew in Tennessee, thank you for holding during that.
[02:49:38.864 --> 02:49:39.385]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:49:39.405 --> 02:49:40.565]  That was cleansing, though.
[02:49:41.266 --> 02:49:44.248]  I had to see a lot of the diaper wearers out there today and it was hard.
[02:49:44.288 --> 02:49:44.568]  Go ahead.
[02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:48.471]  Matthew, I guess you don't want to talk from Tennessee?
[02:49:48.491 --> 02:49:51.914]  I don't even hear him airing the call.
[02:49:51.994 --> 02:49:53.254]  My grandma wouldn't read this!
[02:49:53.915 --> 02:49:59.199]  I tell you what, there are some people who believe that if someone was busting your balls it would make a difference, but it don't.
[02:50:00.911 --> 02:50:04.713]  Uh, we missed what you said at first, because I think the folks airing the calls were away.
[02:50:05.273 --> 02:50:05.733]  Start over.
[02:50:06.974 --> 02:50:07.734]  No, not a problem.
[02:50:07.854 --> 02:50:11.816]  Okay, so we got a couple of issues with, uh, the artificial intelligence.
[02:50:12.336 --> 02:50:17.659]  More likely than not, the operating system that they are using for the artificial intelligence is a modified Linux system.
[02:50:17.839 --> 02:50:20.560]  But that's okay, because there's no threat from Fukushima.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.262]  If I just go, uh, uh, uh, everything's okay, right?
[02:50:25.202 --> 02:50:25.863]  Well, okay.
[02:50:25.923 --> 02:50:30.586]  The first thing that we need to target in this situation are the predictive programs that help control the propaganda.
[02:50:31.547 --> 02:50:32.408]  Alright, stay there.
[02:50:32.448 --> 02:50:33.309]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:50:33.329 --> 02:50:35.030]  Man, that was cleansing.
[02:50:35.050 --> 02:50:38.673]  Man, for like a week I've been watching these PSYOP videos.
[02:50:38.693 --> 02:50:39.474]  It's really getting to me.
[02:50:39.954 --> 02:50:43.377]  And then I saw a bunch of what they've created downtown.
[02:50:43.397 --> 02:50:45.058]  I mean, let me tell you, these are scary people.
[02:50:45.899 --> 02:50:47.460]  And I can tell you a lot of them are CPSers.
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:51.103]  Oh man, I tell you, armies of pot-bellied coming at us hard here.
[02:50:51.303 --> 02:50:51.624]  Stay there.
[02:50:51.644 --> 02:50:52.885]  Oh boy.

[02:51:54.206 --> 02:51:59.948]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[02:53:05.127 --> 02:53:05.548]  What then?
[02:53:07.008 --> 02:53:10.030]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:54:10.341 --> 02:54:26.287]  Yeah, all the neocons that are condescending, all the condescending hippies, all the condescending trendies, all they do is buy into a certain spectrum of bull and then repeat it and pose as if they have knowledge.
[02:54:27.802 --> 02:54:29.703]  And the propaganda is getting so bad.
[02:54:29.743 --> 02:54:32.604]  The Arrested Development adults acting like children now.
[02:54:32.624 --> 02:54:36.925]  I mean, Austin's like the capital of slackers and all of this.
[02:54:36.945 --> 02:54:38.586]  And let me tell you, it's pathetic.
[02:54:39.746 --> 02:54:40.646]  It's pathetic.
[02:54:40.666 --> 02:54:42.467]  People need to grow up and get a life.
[02:54:43.643 --> 02:54:50.308]  But no, they're going to be the new social leaders calling for the invasion of Africa, which has now begun.
[02:54:50.929 --> 02:54:54.011]  One week after Kony, I said, that's a launch a war propaganda.
[02:54:54.331 --> 02:54:57.133]  Look at Bill Gates and all of them involved in it, funding it.
[02:54:57.654 --> 02:54:58.394]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:54:58.414 --> 02:55:02.378]  It's like that's a, that's a green tree.
[02:55:02.478 --> 02:55:03.839]  You know, there's a green tree out in your yard.
[02:55:03.959 --> 02:55:04.539]  It's not hard.
[02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:05.940]  All right.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:08.522]  I said, I go to your calls a little bit of overdrive so I can get to everybody.
[02:55:10.234 --> 02:55:11.356]  Oh man, it makes me sick.
[02:55:11.536 --> 02:55:16.844]  If you saw the video, the office hadn't seen it yet and they thought I was joking about dancing around going, trendy, trendy.
[02:55:17.145 --> 02:55:18.086]  And they call for a war.
[02:55:18.286 --> 02:55:20.249]  They go, worse than Hitler!
[02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:22.352]  Worse than Bin Laden!
[02:55:22.673 --> 02:55:23.734]  It's some dead guy.
[02:55:24.015 --> 02:55:25.437]  And now they're invading all the countries.
[02:55:27.165 --> 02:55:38.357]  I mean, now wars are launched, not by Hitler or Stalin up there lying, but by men prancing around, bending their wrists, going, Trendy, Trendy, Trendy!
[02:55:38.377 --> 02:55:43.123]  And everybody's like, oh my, he bent his wrist on camera and did a little leprechaun dance.
[02:55:43.623 --> 02:55:44.364]  Let's have war!
[02:55:44.844 --> 02:55:47.848]  And you've got swarming idiot trendies running around calling for war.
[02:55:51.721 --> 02:55:52.521]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:55:53.002 --> 02:55:57.864]  Matthew in Tennessee, we're getting into the whole AI situation with the scientist we had on earlier.
[02:55:57.904 --> 02:55:58.264]  Go ahead.
[02:55:59.565 --> 02:56:02.547]  Well, the question is not whether or not there is artificial intelligence.
[02:56:02.587 --> 02:56:06.549]  The question is what degree of intelligence is artificial at this time.
[02:56:07.077 --> 02:56:12.139]  Now, when we're looking at this situation, we have to get down, just like you were saying earlier, to the kernel, right?
[02:56:12.159 --> 02:56:14.259]  Because the kernel is programmed in objects.
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:25.563]  So when you think about one of the obstacles to this situation, it is programming the philosophy of people like Plato, people like Pythagoras, into objects that the computer can then process.
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:28.001]  Right now, people get afraid of this.
[02:56:28.021 --> 02:56:29.401]  There's really no reason to be afraid.
[02:56:29.822 --> 02:56:41.687]  The truth of the matter is, is that if you have studied in your life, and you understand what deception is, when people try to use the predictive programs for propaganda, you can identify that it is deception right away.
[02:56:42.287 --> 02:56:45.849]  So really what we're talking about is, what do we do to free the minds of our countrymen?
[02:56:46.489 --> 02:56:46.689]  Right?
[02:56:46.709 --> 02:56:47.869]  Which is no small task.
[02:56:48.310 --> 02:56:53.332]  So, what I am suggesting to you is, is that we need to get people like Mr. Stallman,
[02:56:53.917 --> 02:57:01.139]  Working on who wrote the predictive programs, who wrote the kernel for the larger mainframes that they are using for the artificial intelligence.
[02:57:01.219 --> 02:57:04.639]  Because there's only so many brilliant people out there and they get recruited from university.
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:10.621]  So if you see someone who you knew in your class, who then disappeared into government work, you know who's working on it.
[02:57:11.301 --> 02:57:15.462]  So there's plenty of info warriors to research this sort of thing, we just need to get on top of the ball.
[02:57:17.503 --> 02:57:25.289]  Well, I hear you, and it was well said, and I agree with you, but we need to get people to actually worry about real things that threaten our society.
[02:57:25.970 --> 02:57:26.490]  God bless you.
[02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:27.331]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:27.351 --> 02:57:29.513]  We've got new articles at Infowars.com.
[02:57:30.213 --> 02:57:34.216]  Angelina Jolie, shills for globalist plan in Africa at ICC trial.
[02:57:35.237 --> 02:57:38.000]  Prancing around telling everybody they're the good guys when you know what they are.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:41.883]  Only remaining MSN reporter covering Ron Paul is pulled.
[02:57:42.724 --> 02:57:47.488]  Gun shop site, re-election fears as gun sales surge, got to all-time highs.

[02:57:58.810 --> 02:58:01.813]  If you believe that, you believe in Keebler elves and pixies.
[02:58:02.453 --> 02:58:03.154]  A major U.S.
[02:58:03.234 --> 02:58:04.855]  airport to evict TSA screeners.
[02:58:06.337 --> 02:58:08.238]  And we have the Rappaport interview up there as well.

[02:58:50.626 --> 02:58:51.888]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:51.928 --> 02:58:57.275]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:57.516 --> 02:59:02.162]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:02.543 --> 02:59:02.943]  It's true.
[02:59:03.023 --> 02:59:05.607]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:59:05.827 --> 02:59:07.590]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:59:08.090 --> 02:59:12.792]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.333 --> 02:59:15.254]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:59:15.634 --> 02:59:20.236]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.436 --> 02:59:21.337]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:21.557 --> 02:59:24.318]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:24.618 --> 02:59:27.920]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.240 --> 02:59:31.083]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:31.423 --> 02:59:33.305]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:33.645 --> 02:59:34.486]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:34.506 --> 02:59:34.706]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:34.746 --> 02:59:37.729]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:38.229 --> 02:59:40.011]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:51.348 --> 02:59:58.150]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:26.123 --> 03:00:27.683]  Okay, we're in a little bit of overdrive here.
[03:00:27.703 --> 03:00:28.744]  Let's move quick to your calls.
[03:00:28.904 --> 03:00:30.504]  Chuck in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:00:30.564 --> 03:00:33.065]  Thanks for holding while I had a breakdown watching Trendy's.
[03:00:33.085 --> 03:00:33.465]  Go ahead.
[03:00:35.326 --> 03:00:36.266]  Yeah, hey buddy.
[03:00:36.286 --> 03:00:38.427]  I was gonna ask you, what do you think of...
[03:00:40.143 --> 03:00:43.365]  I know you're friends with Brad Pitt.
[03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:44.886]  I am not friends with Brad Pitt.
[03:00:45.886 --> 03:00:50.009]  I've said I know people that know a lot about him and I'll just leave it at that.
[03:00:50.049 --> 03:00:50.789]  That's all I ever said.
[03:00:50.809 --> 03:00:52.450]  People turned it all off into this big thing.
[03:00:52.750 --> 03:01:04.036]  I'm attacking Angelina Jolie because she's a warmongering pig who is pushing for all these invasions that have now begun on the back of a phantom menace and the UN is a murdering group and I'm sick of them getting away with this.
[03:01:04.116 --> 03:01:04.757]  I'm calling them out.
[03:01:06.027 --> 03:01:07.008]  And I couldn't agree more.
[03:01:07.068 --> 03:01:08.288]  No, I was curious.
[03:01:08.348 --> 03:01:18.933]  I mean, I don't think Brad feels about this because he, you know, from what I heard, he's kind of a, you know, one of the good guys, you know, like I hear he watches your show and he's got into the, uh, you know, kind of the opposite, it seems like.
[03:01:18.973 --> 03:01:25.856]  Well, I talked to Aaron Russo before he died and he did meet with him and he did know him and they liked his film and said they'd watch my stuff.
[03:01:25.876 --> 03:01:28.938]  And then I separately through some other people, you know, it's like I've met,
[03:01:30.942 --> 03:01:37.845]  A bunch of these people at parties and events that I mean, you know, talk to him, you know, it's like I've met Sean Penn twice.
[03:01:38.645 --> 03:01:42.767]  And then the third time I met him, he didn't even know who I was and later goes, Oh, I like your show.
[03:01:42.907 --> 03:01:42.967]  Oh.
[03:01:42.987 --> 03:01:47.909]  And then once I talked to him on the phone, you know, uh, Charlie Sheen put him on the phone and he knew who I was then.
[03:01:47.929 --> 03:01:49.790]  And then another time didn't know who I was.
[03:01:49.850 --> 03:01:54.512]  So I don't know that they seem smart part of the time and they seem really dumb.
[03:01:54.552 --> 03:01:54.992]  The other part.
[03:01:55.785 --> 03:01:56.486]  But I don't care.
[03:01:56.846 --> 03:02:00.749]  I'm going after Angelina Jolie and exposing her.
[03:02:01.069 --> 03:02:02.170]  And he should be ashamed of her.
[03:02:02.470 --> 03:02:02.971]  And you know what?
[03:02:03.031 --> 03:02:06.213]  If Brad Pitt doesn't like it, he can come, you know, tell me to my face.
[03:02:06.273 --> 03:02:07.694]  I'll stomp his ass into the ground.
[03:02:08.114 --> 03:02:10.817]  His wife is a war criminal, and I don't care.
[03:02:10.837 --> 03:02:11.737]  And I'm exposing her.
[03:02:13.158 --> 03:02:19.083]  Yeah, but he was with Jennifer Aniston right about now.
[03:02:20.515 --> 03:02:22.860]  Well, I tell you, she is really beautiful and horrible bosses.
[03:02:23.943 --> 03:02:24.724]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:02:25.225 --> 03:02:26.708]  I think Aunt Jennifer Aniston is beautiful.
[03:02:27.550 --> 03:02:29.935]  I think, you know, it's not an issue.
[03:02:31.118 --> 03:02:32.899]  I shouldn't be talking about beating people up.
[03:02:32.959 --> 03:02:35.100]  I just, people are sending me emails going, Brad Pitt'll kick your butt.
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:35.700]  Well, good!
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:37.921]  Listen, you know, I'm going up against the New World Order here.
[03:02:37.941 --> 03:02:39.362]  You think I'm worried about some woman's husband?
[03:02:39.962 --> 03:02:41.483]  I don't care if he sends a hit team to kill me.
[03:02:41.603 --> 03:02:42.123]  I don't care.
[03:02:42.343 --> 03:02:42.864]  I'm committed.
[03:02:43.044 --> 03:02:43.924]  I'm not shutting up.
[03:02:43.964 --> 03:02:44.805]  I'm not backing off.
[03:02:45.085 --> 03:02:45.845]  I'm unleashed.
[03:02:46.125 --> 03:02:47.026]  I'm unchained.
[03:02:47.266 --> 03:02:48.086]  I'm sick of it!
[03:02:48.766 --> 03:02:51.388]  I'm calling out a bunch of mass murderers for what they are!
[03:02:52.588 --> 03:02:54.129]  Chuck in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:02:54.149 --> 03:02:54.609]  Go ahead.
[03:02:54.629 --> 03:02:54.669]  Ah!
[03:02:57.531 --> 03:02:58.331]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[03:02:58.651 --> 03:02:59.632]  Rob in California.
[03:02:59.652 --> 03:03:00.052]  Go ahead.
[03:03:01.476 --> 03:03:02.077]  Hello, are you there?
[03:03:02.217 --> 03:03:02.698]  Yes, sir!
[03:03:02.718 --> 03:03:08.167]  Uh, I'm calling from Orange, uh, Oath Keeper's Orange County, California chapter.
[03:03:08.188 --> 03:03:11.834]  Uh, we are promoting a fundraiser for the County Sheriff's Project.
[03:03:12.671 --> 03:03:17.294]  It's called the California Sheriff's Posse Call and Fundraiser.
[03:03:18.075 --> 03:03:19.776]  Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be our guest.
[03:03:45.535 --> 03:03:52.265]  I was looking at this Kony video and analyzing it up close and then I pulled back to quantify the bigger picture.
[03:03:53.038 --> 03:04:00.301]  Kind of like a chess match, and it came to mind that what if, you know, they're keeping Kony hidden till the right time, sort of like Bin Laden?
[03:04:00.501 --> 03:04:01.801]  Oh yeah, no, no, I thought that.
[03:04:01.841 --> 03:04:02.662]  He's probably dead.
[03:04:02.962 --> 03:04:04.442]  Most people think he's been dead for six years.
[03:04:05.183 --> 03:04:08.924]  And then they're gonna roll him out exactly and call the African invasion a victory.
[03:04:09.104 --> 03:04:12.585]  We invaded nine countries and we got some guy I hadn't been seeing in forever.
[03:04:12.886 --> 03:04:13.526]  It's good!
[03:04:14.963 --> 03:04:15.643]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:16.123 --> 03:04:23.525]  You know, Obama uses them as a re-election tool, and then the campaign itself, you know, it says Tony 2012, meaning that it's supposed to end this year.
[03:04:23.985 --> 03:04:28.426]  So all the trendies, you know, they'll be on the bandwagon like, oh, we had a successful mission.
[03:04:28.506 --> 03:04:29.347]  No, exactly.
[03:04:29.387 --> 03:04:32.367]  The minute I saw it, it's a total psyop, and I'm sorry I hadn't made that point.
[03:04:32.387 --> 03:04:33.188]  I 100% agree with you.
[03:04:36.328 --> 03:04:43.452]  And then just one more point, I know they like to have all this fake momentum, and like, hey, we got him, let's go for the next guy.
[03:04:43.472 --> 03:04:52.857]  And so I went and looked, and you'll never believe it, on the ICC wanted list, the next two guys on their list after Kony is a guy in Sudan and then a guy in Congo.
[03:04:52.897 --> 03:04:54.038]  No, no, no, exactly, sir.
[03:04:54.098 --> 03:04:55.879]  It's a bad guy hunt.
[03:04:56.943 --> 03:04:58.164]  To invade all of Africa.
[03:04:58.204 --> 03:04:58.924]  It's been announced.
[03:04:59.125 --> 03:04:59.705]  Absolutely.
[03:04:59.745 --> 03:05:00.205]  That's it.
[03:05:00.686 --> 03:05:04.749]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[03:05:05.149 --> 03:05:06.370]  Everyone can feel it.
[03:05:06.630 --> 03:05:08.131]  We know a tectonic struggle.
