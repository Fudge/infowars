[00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.831]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:17.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.794 --> 00:00:21.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:37.612]  It is Monday, my friends, the 12th day of March 2012.
[00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:42.155]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:47.698]  Sean Stone, director, TV host, filmmaker in his own right.
[00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.061]  Of course, his father is Oliver Stone, who recently converted.
[00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:56.260]  to Shia Islam in Iran is going to be joining us.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.360]  He's been over there a lot.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.301]  People say, is this a stunt?
[00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:05.003]  Well, last time I saw him in person, he was showing me the little sword of Ali around his neck and saying he was thinking about converting.
[00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:06.744]  And I said, are you serious?
[00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:09.945]  And he said, yes, but that's not the main reason he's going to be on with us.
[00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:20.229]  I'm going to get his view on what's happening in the world, what he's seen in Iran, and give you a first look on the upcoming season of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura, Tyrell Ventura and Sean Stone.
[00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:21.050]  They're now reporters.
[00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.591]  On the show, not just behind the scenes.
[00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:31.257]  Of course, I'm in the new season as well of reality TV, and it is reality TV in every sense of the word.
[00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.463]  We're going to obviously cover a story that I'm glad got a lot of attention, but I didn't really think it would.
[00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:45.727]  It's probably getting a lot of attention because yesterday it was top featured on the Drudge Report.
[00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:46.788]  It's still up there today.
[00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:50.370]  Arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes, Kony 2012.
[00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:59.391]  is the name of the video and I've written an article that
[00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.872]  accompanies it, and people are like, really?
[00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:03.412]  Arrest her?
[00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:05.454]  Yeah, she's an envoy to the UN.
[00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:09.336]  She pushed as a propagandist the Libya attack.
[00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:14.200]  She pushed as a propagandist the Syrian attack that's going on.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:26.889]  She pushes all of these wars and says, you know, invade Uganda to go after Kony, when he hasn't been seen in years and is a tiny warlord, when the dictator for 26 years of Uganda
[00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:34.513]  Western Back has killed millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people.
[00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.094]  Some estimates are as high as 7 mil.
[00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:41.757]  And I've got mainstream articles where the UN is in there slaughtering people for their land.
[00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:43.218]  Killing them.
[00:02:43.238 --> 00:02:44.859]  Wounded knees are happening every day.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.402]  And she's there running around at galas and TV and events.
[00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.324]  She's lobbying to even be the head envoy.
[00:02:53.303 --> 00:03:16.672]  uh... for refugees and everybody knows you studied at the u n uses refugee camps to kidnap women children or the rape gangs uh... and a slaughter people in the camps they did that in Rwanda upwards of a million people the u n is the most murderous criminal force ever and that's why there's all this propaganda about UNICEF and the children give your money to it and oh my gosh little puppy dogs
[00:03:17.412 --> 00:03:18.872]  It wants to take good care of you.
[00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:23.273]  The United Nations cares about the children, the children.
[00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:34.916]  And so if she isn't consciously evil, and I've studied her for a while, I've held my tongue for a long time, then she's a total moron and she's publicly served and put on notice.
[00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:44.899]  I mean, I'm calling this whole hoax about the UN being this loving, good organization that oopsie screwed up here and killed a bunch of people, or oopsie screwed up there and killed a bunch of people.
[00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:52.892]  It is a criminal genocide eugenics organization set up by the Rockefellers to carry out extermination.
[00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.173]  It's their official policy.
[00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:56.855]  It's the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments.
[00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:58.255]  It's agenda 21.
[00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:00.417]  It's the whole thing.
[00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:02.058]  It's the army for global government.
[00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:04.720]  NATO is a big contingent of this system.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.801]  Global government openly being run.
[00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:10.324]  And I'm supposed to sit here and go, oh, the UN, they care so much.
[00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:11.445]  Global peace.
[00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:19.008]  The UN is there to demonize sovereign countries that have done nothing and give support towards bombing and destroying those countries.
[00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:23.710]  Now, finally, members of the Security Council said no to an open Syria bombardment.
[00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.452]  And so now the globals are saying, well, we just won't get UN authorization then.
[00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.459]  Because the rest of the U.N.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.262]  is just a debating club, but the Security Council actually has the power.
[00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.544]  So, I'm not even saying the U.N.
[00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:39.985]  someday couldn't do some good.
[00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:46.709]  The point is, it won't do any good if you don't openly call it out for the criminal organization it is.
[00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.590]  And I'm not saying we need a U.N.
[00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.571]  or that I like the U.N.
[00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:53.994]  I'm saying there could be an institution where nations come together for peace and discussion.
[00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:54.755]  But the U.N.
[00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:55.395]  isn't it.
[00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:59.618]  It is a eugenics murdering organization that's killed more people than Hitler.
[00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:06.346]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:14.807]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:19.588]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:30.990]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:40.634]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:46.177]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:53.740]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.822]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.173]  I had tried everything.
[00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:07.297]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:12.201]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:18.906]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:29.875]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:34.759]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.102]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:41.105]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:42.486]  Now that's results.
[00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:49.332]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:55.418]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.660]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.241]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:01.852]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:07.254]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:12.116]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:12.896]  It's true.
[00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:17.538]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:07:18.078 --> 00:07:22.783]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:25.226]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:30.231]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:30.432 --> 00:07:31.333]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:34.316]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:37.900]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.041]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:43.282]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:07:43.622 --> 00:07:45.803]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:49.965]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:56.948]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.709]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.590]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.932]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:30.259]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:32.721]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:41.867]  It is Monday, the 12th day of March, 2012, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:48.172]  Patrick Henningsen, great writer and researcher with Infowars.com, who normally lives in England.
[00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:48.892]  He's an American.
[00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:52.294]  He's going to be joining us in studio today.
[00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:58.595]  He's also here in town visiting South by Southwest event that is going on.
[00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:04.457]  And then we have the son of legendary director Sean Stone joining us.
[00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:11.039]  He's recently spent a lot of time in Iran, as you know, and is going to give us his breakdown on that situation.
[00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:16.460]  Joining us via video Skype coming up for part of the third hour today.
[00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:21.354]  And we will have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:24.055]  There's a lot of really important news.
[00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:33.560]  There has been a media blackout on the fact that since last Wednesday impeachment resolution has been introduced in the House and the Senate.
[00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.062]  I've been hammering it since then.
[00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:40.464]  The Drudge Report has covered it last week and again last night.
[00:09:40.564 --> 00:09:43.085]  That's the only other media outlet other than InfoWars.
[00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:45.267]  But now WorldNet Daily
[00:09:46.215 --> 00:09:51.219]  has gotten on it and just put out a new article last night, so good job there.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:59.806]  Obama impeachment bill now in Congress declares president's use of military power approval high-crime misdemeanor.
[00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:01.308]  So a big victory.
[00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:06.592]  Back when Clinton, impeachment began against Clinton, it was the number one story for months.
[00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:12.237]  The controlled globalist corporate whore press has done everything they can
[00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:17.333]  To sell out to the globalist and to cover this up.
[00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:20.135]  But now the blockade is getting blown wide open.
[00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:25.718]  Kurt Nemo just got another article up at Infowars.com with a video report I shot on that.
[00:10:26.238 --> 00:10:28.439]  Resolution threatens Obama impeachment.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.280]  U.S.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.203]  military action against Syria without congressional authorization violates the Constitution.
[00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.907]  And so we're going to be going over
[00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:44.198]  All of that today.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.305]  And it violates, of course, more than just that.
[00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:54.930]  It specifically violates Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:04.936]  Again, it violates Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:14.340]  For anybody that wants to go look that up for themselves, it also violates other areas of the Constitution.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:23.964]  And we have links to that legislation as well in the article, so some very good news on that front.
[00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:32.302]  Also, scientists warn EPA over Monsanto's GMO crop failures and dangers.
[00:11:32.342 --> 00:11:34.723]  We have an important report on that front.
[00:11:34.883 --> 00:11:41.427]  There's been a lot of talk about this over the last few months, but now Zero Hedge is reporting on it because the aircraft carrier is being sent there.
[00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.849]  Aircraft Carrier Enterprise sets off on final journey.
[00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:46.989]  Direction Iran!
[00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.511]  And wouldn't it be convenient?
[00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:55.679]  The globalists love to blow up ships that are about to be decommissioned, or towers that are rotting with asbestos, and then blame it on enemies.
[00:11:55.719 --> 00:12:07.151]  We know that Cy Hirst, Pulitzer Prize winner, a year after Cheney left office, could talk about it then, and said his sources confirmed to him, the New Yorker magazine reported on this, that Cheney ordered the Navy to have
[00:12:08.106 --> 00:12:11.830]  Craft painted up like Iranian patrol boats and have Navy SEALs attack U.S.
[00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.671]  destroyers, the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:12:14.272 --> 00:12:19.857]  Admiral Fox Fallon, then head of CENTCOM, refused, talked bad about Cheney, and then was fired.
[00:12:20.518 --> 00:12:21.379]  But now we know why.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.022]  So today at noon Eastern, that's right now,
[00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:26.602]  It's being launched.
[00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:42.229]  The storied aircraft carrier Enterprise aka CVN-65 left its home port of Naval Station Novak, Virginia on one final time for its final voyage with a heading the Arabian Sea aka Iran.
[00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:49.711]  It'll be there in a week and it will join the CVN-72 Lincoln and CVN-70 Vinson as well as LHD-8
[00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:58.418]  Macon Island, all of which are supporting any potential escalation of hostilities in the Persian Gulf region.
[00:12:59.018 --> 00:13:11.824]  As a reminder, back in January, we learned that the Enterprise's final voyage will be in proximity to Iran, and in the meantime, the aircraft carrier held extensive drills off the Florida coast to attack a fake theocracy.
[00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:19.347]  It's an artificial theocracy in the drill, aka Iran, consisting of fundamentalist
[00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:44.811]  Shahada made up name states why the Arabian Sea is about seven ten two days Will be home to not two but three aircraft carriers and a big deck amphibious warfare ship is very much an open question Although we may have some thoughts Yeah, no kidding So we'll open the phones up
[00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:50.619]  On that point as well here in a moment, here are some of the other articles at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.183]  South Park takes on the TSA in season premiere.
[00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:59.287]  Creators set sights on control freak society.
[00:13:59.407 --> 00:14:02.790]  Yeah, we're trying to download it right now off his Android phone.
[00:14:03.411 --> 00:14:07.735]  Most of my IT folks and people get in about 10 or 11 because they usually work into the night.
[00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:11.679]  But Patrick Henningsen's here and was showing me the video.
[00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:26.033]  of a gentleman who has two artificial legs that he talked to at the airport being harassed by TSA as they were freaking out and asking him what his artificial legs were.
[00:14:26.954 --> 00:14:27.774]  And you've seen it in the news.
[00:14:27.814 --> 00:14:28.594]  They say, what's this?
[00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:29.314]  It's a breast pump.
[00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:31.815]  Pump milk in front of me to prove it's a breast pump.
[00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:33.175]  What's this?
[00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:34.556]  It's breast milk I pumped.
[00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:35.016]  Drink it.
[00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:37.817]  It's all about exercise of power.
[00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:38.757]  What's this?
[00:14:38.817 --> 00:14:39.857]  It's a colostomy bag.
[00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:41.498]  I'm going to rip it off of you here in public.
[00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.578]  No, don't do that.
[00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:46.212]  They pull up, no, please, please, and then you know what?
[00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:46.973]  Sprays everywhere.
[00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:49.655]  Same thing with the urology bags they have.
[00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:54.017]  I forget the technical name of them, but instead of feces, it's urine.
[00:14:54.037 --> 00:14:55.678]  I hate to get technical, but that's what's going on.
[00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:02.002]  Or they take babies' diapers off, or make women pull their shirts off, or strip children down naked in front of people.
[00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:03.103]  It's all been videotaped.
[00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:04.024]  It's all been on the news.
[00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:10.488]  And they always say, we don't strip children, and then there's the video of it, or we don't strip old ladies behind closed doors, and later they have to admit they are.
[00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.212]  And you've seen them where they make women take earrings out.
[00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:16.453]  Like, what is that?
[00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:17.113]  Well, it's an earring.
[00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.755]  Or it's a tongue ring.
[00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:19.776]  Well, I can't remove it.
[00:15:19.816 --> 00:15:20.836]  Well, we got pliers.
[00:15:20.897 --> 00:15:21.157]  Do it.
[00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:23.238]  And the woman hurts herself and is bleeding everywhere.
[00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:24.680]  Misses her flight.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.862]  Or... What is this?
[00:15:27.882 --> 00:15:28.983]  Well, I had breast cancer.
[00:15:30.344 --> 00:15:31.305]  I had my breast removed.
[00:15:31.905 --> 00:15:32.546]  Well, what is it?
[00:15:33.026 --> 00:15:35.128]  Well, it's a pad to make it look like the other one.
[00:15:35.188 --> 00:15:35.969]  It's a prosthesis.
[00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:37.130]  It's cosmetic.
[00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.250]  And they're just like, take it off!
[00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:39.251]  In front of people!
[00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:42.354]  And the woman's crying, pulling it out from under her shirt.
[00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:44.786]  This is what goes on.
[00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:51.449]  It's about total humiliation ahead of forced inoculations, secret arrests, government putting its hands on you.
[00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:54.330]  They're passing your comfort zones on purpose.
[00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.070]  None of it has to do with security.
[00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.191]  And they always say, well just do the body scanner, we won't grope you.
[00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:08.555]  Every time I've flown and watched people scanned, over and over again, almost everyone I've seen go through the scanner is then directed over for a grope down.
[00:16:12.537 --> 00:16:37.055]  Well now I was talking to Patrick Hennigsen and he says that they've got more video but they're back there downloading and I saw right before I went on air that this guy's got two artificial legs and they're asking him what they are and saying take them off and stuff and the guy's like I these are my artificial legs and they're barking at him and everything else I mean it and you're like but that's horrible it's about being horrible
[00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.404]  It's about humiliation.
[00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:43.067]  It's about seeing what you will take.
[00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:50.694]  It's about seeing what you will put up with.
[00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:53.296]  Continuing.
[00:16:55.618 --> 00:17:01.724]  1960s slums of Chicago uses laboratory by Rockefeller's Population Council.
[00:17:02.044 --> 00:17:03.285]  Another big article about that.
[00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:04.586]  Testing things on people.
[00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:06.268]  Go read it.
[00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:14.202]  Ron Paul wins first caucus, MSM changes rules, reports Romney wins.
[00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.304]  Yeah, I guess they couldn't steal it in that state.
[00:17:17.324 --> 00:17:21.928]  They stole it in Iowa, Maine, Nevada, South Carolina.
[00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:24.229]  And then by then, people started thinking, well, he can't win.
[00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:30.794]  And then they haven't had to engage in much fraud, because people say, I was going to vote for Ron Paul, but, you know, he didn't make it like I thought.
[00:17:31.494 --> 00:17:39.060]  And I even saw some of his own staff, quoted by Politico, some of the younger folks that work for him, going in the presidential campaign, going, oh my gosh,
[00:17:42.068 --> 00:17:42.928]  Oh my gosh!
[00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:47.511]  We just don't understand why he wins in polls and straw polls but isn't here.
[00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:48.631]  We're mystified.
[00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.332]  You're mystified?
[00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:50.993]  There's open fraud going on.
[00:17:51.493 --> 00:17:52.573]  Ron Paul's even said it.
[00:17:55.515 --> 00:18:01.438]  I remember whenever Wayne Paul was on the air a few months ago and there was fraud in Iowa.
[00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:04.121]  That was fraud two days before.
[00:18:04.181 --> 00:18:07.362]  That Republican operative said, don't worry, he's not going to win, we're going to fix it.
[00:18:07.883 --> 00:18:14.905]  And so we sent that video to high-level folks in their poll campaign, and then I saw the email back going, nothing to this, nothing to worry about.
[00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:16.445]  Really, there was nothing to worry about?
[00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:18.126]  There in Iowa?
[00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:19.666]  And again, I'm not attacking anybody.
[00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.387]  I just, let's all stop being naive.
[00:18:23.271 --> 00:18:34.921]  Not trusting a government that's been caught engaging in election fraud over and over again, and being honest about it, is the only way we're ever going to wake up as a country and change the electronic voting machines and the fraud.
[00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:43.529]  But in the case of the caucuses, he openly won, and they said on Fox News, well, a bunch of trucks got lost with the ballots after the caucuses voted in Iowa.
[00:18:43.869 --> 00:18:45.030]  Folks, there are no trucks.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:47.913]  They vote, they post on the wall, they telephone it in.
[00:18:48.734 --> 00:18:49.654]  It was all the counties,
[00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:56.723]  Like where Ames' base, that are colleges, where he had double digit, in some cases, 52% leads.
[00:18:57.885 --> 00:18:59.947]  I mean, in some areas he had 52% of the vote.
[00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:02.649]  Just didn't get counted.
[00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:05.673]  You understand that?
[00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:07.775]  That's on record!
[00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.443]  And the campaign didn't do anything about that.
[00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:12.985]  They finally did by Maine.
[00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.867]  Even the New York Times said, yeah, he really won Maine.
[00:19:15.327 --> 00:19:17.270]  And the Republican leadership said, doesn't matter, we're not counting it.
[00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.191]  We're giving it to Romney.
[00:19:18.611 --> 00:19:22.015]  So, Ron Paul was the frontrunner and has been cheated.
[00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:25.658]  Now, if people don't want to wake up and admit that, that's their problem.
[00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:28.301]  But if the American people, people are like, well, that's a negative view.
[00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:30.787]  It's not a negative view of its reality.
[00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:32.329]  You're like, well then why'd you say run Ron Paul?
[00:19:32.569 --> 00:19:33.650]  Because he educated people.
[00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.771]  He injected real ideas.
[00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:35.772]  It built a bigger movement.
[00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:41.177]  And we're exposing fraud now, which exposes naivete, so people can get the rude awakening.
[00:19:41.377 --> 00:19:43.660]  You gotta smell the stench of the New World Order.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.303]  Wake up and smell the stink of the New World Order.
[00:19:47.323 --> 00:19:49.345]  Look, Ron Paul won the Virgin Islands.
[00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.928]  Well, the news gave it to Romney, even though the official results, Paul won.
[00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:54.611]  That's how they work.
[00:19:54.872 --> 00:19:55.513]  It's a psyop.
[00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:58.139]  They cannot ever let winner be attached to his name.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.342]  It's a psyop.
[00:19:59.683 --> 00:20:00.043]  We'll be back.
[00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:08.105]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:25.836]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:30.179]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:31.980]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:39.965]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:35.628]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:41.512]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.612 --> 00:21:45.014]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.641]  Hey, you know that hormone-balancing product we talked about before?
[00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:07.521]  The all-natural one.
[00:23:07.802 --> 00:23:08.142]  Amberin?
[00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:09.382]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:16.764]  Not only did Amberin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Amberin program, I have lost so much weight.
[00:23:16.884 --> 00:23:18.585]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:19.205]  It's gone.
[00:23:19.225 --> 00:23:21.486]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:22.346]  I feel great.
[00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:23.046]  Give me a call.
[00:23:23.186 --> 00:23:26.668]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:23:26.848 --> 00:23:30.409]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:34.891]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:37.212]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:23:37.352 --> 00:23:40.233]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:44.775]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:51.678]  1-800-408-1130.
[00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:53.839]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:54.500]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:24:25.353 --> 00:24:34.075]  I made the point on yesterday's Sunday transmission that the globalists are now moving on every front.
[00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:43.938]  They're invading scores of nations through proxy wars, through rebels, publicly funded by NATO, the United States, England, France, the UN.
[00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.259]  They are involved in massacres all over the world.
[00:24:51.121 --> 00:25:03.664]  They are openly announcing in every major financial publication from The Economist to Forbes to Newsweek and Time that world government is here run by private banks.
[00:25:04.925 --> 00:25:10.546]  Obama Friday signed the bill giving people felony charges for protesting anywhere the feds are having an event.
[00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:14.507]  For miles around.
[00:25:17.913 --> 00:25:20.635]  Absolute free speech chilling system.
[00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:25.998]  They're openly federalizing local police, putting in threat fusion centers, spying on the public without warrants.
[00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:32.923]  Hundreds of reporters have been arrested with no fanfare and charged under the Espionage Act for talking to U.S.
[00:25:32.983 --> 00:25:40.267]  whistleblowers and exposing government corruption, stealing money, bid rigging, spying on people illegally.
[00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:45.971]  High-level NSA officer was just in the news yesterday saying Obama worse than Bush, you bet.
[00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:51.615]  But because he has left cover, the so-called trendy left is in a coma.
[00:25:53.776 --> 00:26:01.160]  Now, it isn't our top story because Angelina Jolie is a poster girl for the UN.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:10.125]  It's not our top story because I shot a video about it and it's now in dozens and dozens of newspapers, thousands of blogs, and was the top story on the Drudge Report.
[00:26:11.386 --> 00:26:13.647]  It's our top story because through the window
[00:26:15.285 --> 00:26:26.348]  Now, of Angelina Jolie, we can really see the propaganda war, the PSYOP, of the UN and their global eugenics extermination operation that they publicly carry out everywhere.
[00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:40.311]  As you know, five, six days ago, when Kony 2012, a government-connected, Bill Gates-connected, funded propaganda piece came out, basically pushing for
[00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:45.628]  Military invasion of Uganda by the US, UN, NATO, and others.
[00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:49.530]  And by the way, they're already there carrying out different operations.
[00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:58.033]  It's a film that was just put out to brand some boogeyman who's probably been dead.
[00:26:58.053 --> 00:26:59.314]  He hadn't been seen in over five years.
[00:27:00.074 --> 00:27:05.536]  And who has a tiny area that his people still control, a few hundred square miles in the north of Uganda.
[00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:13.234]  And they put out a video basically calling for an invasion and let's get Coney.
[00:27:13.594 --> 00:27:17.177]  And it makes the UN International Criminal Court look like rock stars.
[00:27:17.997 --> 00:27:20.079]  And that they're great people who want to help everybody.
[00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:27.445]  It's just shallow propaganda designed for an American population on average that can't even find Africa on a map.
[00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:32.208]  And the average American in national polls, you can pull this up, thinks Africa is a country.
[00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.232]  I saw that number last year, something like 54% think it's a country.
[00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:40.268]  It's a continent.
[00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:42.669]  South America's a continent.
[00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:43.869]  North America's a continent.
[00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.150]  Asia's a continent.
[00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:47.550]  Europe's a continent.
[00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.791]  Australia's a continent.
[00:27:52.091 --> 00:27:53.832]  Antarctica is a continent.
[00:27:55.552 --> 00:27:56.373]  They're not countries.
[00:27:57.573 --> 00:28:00.434]  And I know my audience, who's informed, is like, yeah, Alex, we know that.
[00:28:00.694 --> 00:28:03.435]  Listen, you wonder why the general public's so easy to control?
[00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:08.756]  They don't know that Africa is a bunch of countries inside of a continent.
[00:28:10.486 --> 00:28:13.053]  They think the entire continent is a country.
[00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.693]  And that's why they can have this invincible ignorance.
[00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:27.278]  I mean, more and more the propaganda we face, as Joseph Goebbels said, is just really simple and mindless and so stupid and so false.
[00:28:27.738 --> 00:28:28.619]  It's like a tar baby.
[00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:29.720]  How do you even deal with it?
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:40.888]  I mean, I've got stacks of confirmed, even mainstream articles, where the UN is all over Africa just murdering and slaughtering and raping and killing and burning down villages and taking people's property.
[00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:47.957]  And running off these poor little tribes that are there living happily, you know, in the fields and in the jungles, growing their own crops.
[00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:51.082]  Forcing them into the cities to work as slave labor.
[00:28:52.784 --> 00:28:59.112]  Injecting them with all sorts of, you know, UN-sponsored vaccines that, in some countries, half the women have HIV.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:11.402]  They've done even a BBC study a decade ago saying we checked the women's hymen and almost all of them never even had sexual intercourse and lived in villages and had never been touched.
[00:29:11.482 --> 00:29:12.643]  Why do they have HIV?
[00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:19.804]  They'd all had vaccines and the BBC said, oh, they must be using dirty needles at the UN.
[00:29:20.044 --> 00:29:22.285]  No, you don't get HIV that easy.
[00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:26.045]  They're shooting them up with it.
[00:29:26.605 --> 00:29:27.526]  It is a bioweapon.
[00:29:27.546 --> 00:29:28.206]  That's on record.
[00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:29.046]  The Navy developed it.
[00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:30.237]  All right.
[00:29:30.857 --> 00:29:34.458]  When I come back, I'm going to tell you why I've called for the arrest of Angelina Jolie.
[00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:39.540]  Because I'm calling for the arrest of all of these envoys from the UN.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:40.681]  Okay?
[00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:42.261]  We need to have our own Nuremberg trial.
[00:29:42.921 --> 00:29:48.003]  The United Nations is the most murderous criminal organization the world has ever seen.
[00:29:48.543 --> 00:29:49.904]  It's designed to kill people.
[00:29:50.324 --> 00:29:51.224]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:53.305]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:14.386]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:31:58.311 --> 00:31:59.172]  Others don't.
[00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:07.380]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:25.250]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:29.633]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:29.893 --> 00:32:31.494]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:31.674 --> 00:32:39.520]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:33:05.795 --> 00:33:08.035]  Soundhouse is Victorious!
[00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:26.500]  It's hip, hip, sound, and metal in the air!
[00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:51.787]  Hear the cry of war.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:33:55.989]  Louder than before.
[00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:02.632]  With this sword in hand, you control the land.
[00:34:03.832 --> 00:34:05.513]  Wasn't that song written by Dave Mustaine?
[00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:07.654]  The Phantom Lord?
[00:34:07.674 --> 00:34:08.874]  Crank it up!
[00:34:08.894 --> 00:34:15.617]  This is the Metallica I like right here.
[00:34:16.365 --> 00:34:24.635]  But Joe Lee comes in peace.
[00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:34.887]  And who is Joe Lee?
[00:34:36.284 --> 00:34:37.005]  I looked in her eyes.
[00:34:37.025 --> 00:34:37.885]  She burns!
[00:34:38.806 --> 00:34:40.167]  With the power trip.
[00:34:40.887 --> 00:34:42.709]  With the enjoyment of parading around.
[00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:43.689]  It's like Team America.
[00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.371]  But they're like, we need an actor, Gary.
[00:34:48.673 --> 00:34:50.174]  That's exactly what's going on here.
[00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:53.056]  And I can make jokes about it.
[00:34:54.687 --> 00:34:55.928]  But it's very, very serious.
[00:34:56.008 --> 00:35:07.396]  I mean, I was, in the last five days, doing more research on Kony 2012, because I knew up front it was a UN pro-war, pro-invasion, pro-world government, international criminal court, arresting whoever they want.
[00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:17.002]  All these Supreme Court justices saying, we're now going to take the precedent of the UN, who says you have no right to own firearms, anything, and adopt that as our law.
[00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:21.966]  And now our Congress, last Tuesday, now seven days ago, was told
[00:35:23.263 --> 00:35:31.727]  By the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman and the SecDef, Secretary of Defense, we take our orders from the UN and NATO, not from Congress.
[00:35:32.427 --> 00:35:38.570]  And the Senator kept saying, we have the war powers, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[00:35:39.611 --> 00:35:40.671]  And they said, nope!
[00:35:42.152 --> 00:35:44.453]  And the Senator Sessions said, I'm almost breathless.
[00:35:44.853 --> 00:35:47.735]  And the Senators were all looking around, because this is treason!
[00:35:50.174 --> 00:35:51.835]  And you've got Angelina Jolie.
[00:35:51.915 --> 00:36:02.678]  I mean, I refreshed my memory on her because I've always thought that she looks like a dead carp or something, and I'm not trying to talk about the way a woman looks, but she just does not fancy me as that beautiful.
[00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:04.239]  Snake-like.
[00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:06.739]  She could play a vampire in movies.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:14.002]  I'm just not into ring-wraith looking women, but that's a side... I know she's really vain, and I know she's watching, and I know she's listening, and so...
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:31.525]  My hatred of you for hurting the children and doing it in the name of humanitarianism is so bad that I do try to hurt your worldly, vain countenance.
[00:36:33.906 --> 00:36:34.966]  And I'm being worldly there.
[00:36:35.046 --> 00:36:37.027]  I should just be strong and resist you.
[00:36:37.047 --> 00:36:39.048]  It's just that you make me want to throw up.
[00:36:39.128 --> 00:36:39.848]  Now, continuing.
[00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:47.173]  And even though she's a mid-level minion at the UN, she is a key propagandist.
[00:36:48.193 --> 00:37:03.224]  And so, I already knew all this about her, but before I attacked somebody, I was doing just hours and hours of Kony 2012 research, confirming Rockefeller's State Department involved in it, funding it, in it, pushing for invasions, pushing for AFRICOM.
[00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:05.026]  That's where all this was going.
[00:37:05.706 --> 00:37:12.228]  They launched the film last week, gets 100 million views just on one platform alone, probably 200 million total in different venues.
[00:37:12.728 --> 00:37:18.290]  It's all over every news channel, establishment media, promoting it everywhere, how great it is.
[00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.271]  Kony's the devil, he's just like Hitler and Bin Laden.
[00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:25.452]  They actually said that on the news, showed images of Hitler, faded into Kony.
[00:37:25.772 --> 00:37:29.013]  I saw that across TV networks, across newspaper graphics.
[00:37:29.473 --> 00:37:31.554]  I mean, it was a unified propaganda putsch.
[00:37:32.847 --> 00:37:33.667]  To invade Africa.
[00:37:33.687 --> 00:37:38.428]  And they said, Kony 2012, one thing we all agree on, you know, basically invade Uganda.
[00:37:38.968 --> 00:37:40.389]  So I went and refreshed myself.
[00:37:40.449 --> 00:37:42.149]  I got professors on that have been there.
[00:37:42.649 --> 00:37:44.349]  I got journalists on who've been there.
[00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:45.870]  I went and did research.
[00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.270]  And I sometimes kind of get obsessed on a particular topic.
[00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:53.171]  So I probably did five, six, seven hours of research per day after last Wednesday.
[00:37:56.092 --> 00:37:57.792]  When Richard Reeves brought this to my attention.
[00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:01.273]  And
[00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:18.203]  I began to refresh myself on that in Uganda, the dictator of Uganda, the Westbacks, they don't call him a dictator, has been involved in the deaths of 7 million people conservatively in his country and surrounding nations.
[00:38:19.624 --> 00:38:26.127]  I mean, just a Western killing machine where they just wipe out whole groups who are on diamonds, gold, rare earth minerals, oil.
[00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:34.774]  Kony is certainly, you know, a bad guy, but you've got all these homeless kids and people, gives them weapons, feeds them, you know, uses them basically as cannon fodder.
[00:38:35.975 --> 00:38:37.536]  But he's a tiny little warlord.
[00:38:37.576 --> 00:38:42.020]  He's just some bad guy to then prop up the Ugandan dictator.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:49.727]  And I found out the UN has launched in the last year a new offensive just slaughtering people everywhere with global corporations for their land.
[00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:50.928]  I mean, it's in the New York Times.
[00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:57.529]  And for you in carbon taxes, Paul Watson has links to all this in the articles he's written about it, so does Kurt Nemo.
[00:38:58.129 --> 00:39:13.620]  So, all of this is going on, all of this is happening, and so I start researching it, and it just brought back to mind that Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy, ten thousand dies, it's a statistic.
[00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:17.163]  And I was just refreshing myself, my memory,
[00:39:19.645 --> 00:39:22.546]  On what's going on in Africa, and I mean it is a genocide.
[00:39:23.187 --> 00:39:28.389]  You could speculate all day about the tetanus shots they give them that sterilize them and the UN got caught giving them HIV.
[00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:30.750]  People can try to deny that, even though the proof's there.
[00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:37.532]  The fact that the UN goes in, backed by mercenaries, and burns down villages and just mows people down.
[00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:42.754]  And just all over Africa there's just piles of skeletons everywhere.
[00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:45.976]  And then you've got
[00:39:46.934 --> 00:39:54.041]  At the clothing stores, at the mall, and on TV, and I see women's bags, especially attractive women for some reason, it'll be UNICEF.
[00:39:54.662 --> 00:39:56.744]  And it's, they give women to feed the kids.
[00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:59.707]  Yeah, you mean have a PR stunt where it shows them feeding them?
[00:39:59.947 --> 00:40:02.350]  All over the mountain, the mercenaries are lining them up and shooting them?
[00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:07.555]  I mean, it's like, don't run, we're your friends, we come in peace, and Mars attacks and they're shooting everybody.
[00:40:08.216 --> 00:40:10.058]  I mean, it is just incredible!
[00:40:10.993 --> 00:40:25.659]  And so then I got mad, and I said, wait a minute, I know Joe Lee's a UN envoy, I know she pushes all this refugee stuff, which the UN uses for extermination operations to round folks up and starve them to death, or let the neighboring tribe come in and kill them in the case of Rwanda, or sometimes they just machine gun everybody.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.002]  They sex slave them, there's photos and videos of them roasting kids over fires, the UN.
[00:40:31.382 --> 00:40:34.763]  I mean, you want to rape and murder and kill, go join the UN army.
[00:40:34.843 --> 00:40:36.304]  I mean, there's nothing like it.
[00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:42.134]  It is an army of... Genghis Khan's military was not this wicked.
[00:40:43.255 --> 00:40:49.660]  I mean, it's well known that if you're a pedophile, pervert, rapist, criminal, you go join the UN because you've got diplomatic immunity.
[00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:51.262]  None of these other countries have immunity.
[00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:55.125]  The UN, because it's the global banker's army, they have diplomatic immunity.
[00:40:56.086 --> 00:41:03.493]  That's why they always get caught, different UN diplomats with sex slaves and killing kids and all this, because it's just an army of darkness.
[00:41:04.551 --> 00:41:09.554]  With a bunch of propaganda telling you that it loves you and cares about you and, you know, give money.
[00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:18.239]  I mean, I grew up, even at the church we went to one time, we raised money for UNICEF selling cookies.
[00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:26.965]  I had friends that would go out, you know, like kids and not get money at Christmas for the Salvation Army, but for the UN.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.201]  I mean, I have worked to give the UN money.
[00:41:30.902 --> 00:41:32.163]  When I was a little kid, just a few times.
[00:41:32.683 --> 00:41:40.288]  This is the type of stuff that goes on, how they use well-meaning people, and then they use somebody like Angelina Jolie with her horrible history.
[00:41:40.328 --> 00:41:40.989]  Go look into it.
[00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:52.136]  Not just breaking up families, but snatching people's kids, she's just like Madonna, and then watching her, and all these Illuminati movies she's into, and just getting off.
[00:41:52.216 --> 00:41:56.960]  She's in award ceremonies every night, a narcissistic, empty husk.
[00:41:58.561 --> 00:42:00.003]  For demonic entities to live in.
[00:42:01.746 --> 00:42:02.406]  Pun intended.
[00:42:03.528 --> 00:42:06.992]  So all of this is going on and I for one am sick of it.
[00:42:07.353 --> 00:42:10.016]  I'm calling the hoax that is the UN.
[00:42:10.797 --> 00:42:11.879]  I'm calling it out.
[00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:12.820]  I'm done.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.803]  I'm done playing games with these people.
[00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:16.923]  You notice I'm turning the heat up.
[00:42:16.964 --> 00:42:19.026]  It's like I said a few months ago in those promos we run.
[00:42:19.407 --> 00:42:21.429]  I say the info war now goes to the next level.
[00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.612]  I'm not here to play games with these people.
[00:42:23.632 --> 00:42:25.034]  I'm here to break their hoax.
[00:42:25.735 --> 00:42:26.956]  And it's so close to breaking.
[00:42:27.537 --> 00:42:32.143]  This Kony 2012 thing, over 100 million views on one video alone, has totally blown up.
[00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:42.730]  Now the negative comments have gone 5 to 1, the negative votes against it have reversed and are going more than 5 to 1, when they were almost completely positive just 4 or 5 days ago.
[00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:49.214]  There are thousands of videos against it, including Ugandans, saying, are you kidding?
[00:42:49.374 --> 00:42:52.176]  Kony hadn't been seen in 5, 6 years, he was a tiny warlord.
[00:42:52.456 --> 00:42:54.378]  The President here is murdering everybody.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.781]  The UN is killing people.
[00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:03.015]  So I see her as this U.N.
[00:43:03.155 --> 00:43:16.422]  envoy who's always pushing Libya wars, Syria invasions, all of it, giving it left cover, being lauded as this wonderful humanitarian who cares about everybody, and I've had enough.
[00:43:17.603 --> 00:43:18.103]  I've had enough.
[00:43:18.123 --> 00:43:20.645]  People are like, wow, yeah, I agree the U.N.'
[00:43:20.625 --> 00:43:22.125]  's killing people, but wow, arrest her?
[00:43:22.245 --> 00:43:22.826]  Absolutely.
[00:43:23.386 --> 00:43:24.907]  I'm not saying arrest her for thought crimes.
[00:43:26.533 --> 00:43:33.612]  But if you're a UN envoy calling for the government to continue to crack down on the population in the name of getting some boogeyman...
[00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:39.147]  When there's a major globalist offensive to clean people off the land in Uganda and surrounding areas.
[00:43:39.487 --> 00:43:47.470]  And this is all a big PR stunt for the murderous UN and its kangaroo ICC where they grab people and they almost always die in their jail before the kangaroo trial.
[00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:55.213]  When you're pushing a criminal, genocidal, world government instrument and you are a top envoy now, not just spokeswoman.
[00:43:55.593 --> 00:43:59.474]  You're not like Shirley Temple, you know, promoting the Department of War.
[00:44:00.175 --> 00:44:03.656]  You are a globalist snake
[00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:16.142]  And so, yes, I can use her celebrity that they use to push their evil, and like Judo, boomerang it back on them and say, arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes.
[00:44:17.343 --> 00:44:20.464]  And the video is gonna be seen millions of times.
[00:44:22.404 --> 00:44:31.207]  I can already tell you that if it says it's been seen 170,000 times, and I just put it up there yesterday afternoon,
[00:44:32.318 --> 00:44:40.666]  That it takes time for those number counts to basically build up, and it'll end up getting seen 2-3 million times unless YouTube blocks it.
[00:44:41.047 --> 00:44:44.610]  And people are like, well your show has 3 million listeners a day, 15 million a week, why do you care so much about this?
[00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:52.498]  This is reaching all the mainline, dumbbell, dumbed-down, ignorant, young people that have been bamboozled by Kony2012.
[00:44:53.439 --> 00:45:00.863]  And this is going directly to Joe Lee and is going to create a snowball of not just exposing her, but the entire UN system.
[00:45:01.123 --> 00:45:05.466]  Now there's a small chance Joe Lee is just a useful idiot and really thinks she's helping people.
[00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:25.765]  And so, if my calling for her arrest, but I go on to call for the leadership's arrest, Ban Ki-moon, the big megacorporations, I want the arrest of Kofi Annan, and by the way, that's been called for in mainstream media and by major courts, for all the oil for food and starving people for money and being paid off.
[00:45:26.065 --> 00:45:28.988]  I mean, it's an unusually corrupt group.
[00:45:30.509 --> 00:45:31.730]  Because of diplomatic immunity.
[00:45:33.651 --> 00:45:37.675]  You give somebody diplomatic immunity, license to kill, steal, what do you think's gonna happen?
[00:45:39.184 --> 00:45:43.668]  And so I want this woman to know we know who she is as the spokesman for this.
[00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:45.109]  I'm going after their spokesman.
[00:45:46.271 --> 00:45:49.333]  It's like they're trying to sell cigarettes to kids with Joe Camel.
[00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.217]  Kids, Joe Camel wants to kill you.
[00:45:53.857 --> 00:45:58.542]  Joe Camel isn't even real, but I'm saying it in a language everybody can understand.
[00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:05.286]  Well, Angelina Jolie is real, makes all these pro-Illuminati movies, all these pro-police state movies.
[00:46:05.546 --> 00:46:07.268]  She's got a movie out promoting U.N.
[00:46:07.308 --> 00:46:14.394]  invasion and attack on Serbia, which again, both sides were killing each other in that.
[00:46:14.934 --> 00:46:20.819]  But the Croats, the Muslims and others, statistically, and the U.N.
[00:46:20.839 --> 00:46:22.961]  admits this, killed two to one Serbs.
[00:46:23.877 --> 00:46:25.838]  Both sides, ethnic warfare, horrible.
[00:46:26.238 --> 00:46:28.638]  I'm not a Serb, I'm not a Croat, I'm not a Muslim.
[00:46:28.918 --> 00:46:30.139]  I don't have a dog in the fight.
[00:46:30.259 --> 00:46:31.879]  I went and actually researched what happened.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.240]  And outside of mainstream television, the UN even admits what happened.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:37.941]  Two to one!
[00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:51.184]  But they wanted to destroy Serbia and give Southern Serbia, the equivalent of a third of the US, in comparison, to Albania, which is run by a bunch of Al-Qaeda terrorists to ship heroin through.
[00:46:51.943 --> 00:46:53.184]  And they're running the sex trade.
[00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:58.368]  They've been ethically cleansing Serbs that are left in Kosovo ever since then.
[00:47:02.231 --> 00:47:02.671]  Oh, really?
[00:47:03.311 --> 00:47:06.714]  So she's filming a movie now where she plays the mistress of all evil?
[00:47:09.264 --> 00:47:11.424]  She's playing the evil witch from Sleeping Beauty.
[00:47:11.484 --> 00:47:12.105]  Very interesting.
[00:47:12.385 --> 00:47:13.205]  Well, I mean, there you go.
[00:47:13.305 --> 00:47:14.225]  I've looked in her eyes.
[00:47:14.285 --> 00:47:15.545]  I've seen how she operates.
[00:47:16.105 --> 00:47:18.206]  She is an incredibly wicked person.
[00:47:18.246 --> 00:47:23.387]  My gut, my instincts, and her entire history show she wants to run for president later.
[00:47:23.727 --> 00:47:26.047]  She wants to be the head of the IMF or World Bank later.
[00:47:26.347 --> 00:47:27.988]  She's very hungry for this.
[00:47:28.328 --> 00:47:29.588]  She's enjoying it.
[00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:33.029]  She enjoys these dark roles because she's a very dark person.
[00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:34.809]  Very small chance she's a useful idiot.
[00:47:37.714 --> 00:47:38.675]  And so I'm here.
[00:47:39.275 --> 00:47:42.779]  You want to be the champion for AFRICOM invasion of Africa?
[00:47:43.019 --> 00:47:50.165]  Well, I'll stand up and try to get the people to rally so we can all be the champions of everybody being downtrodden by the globalist boot.
[00:47:51.286 --> 00:47:55.970]  And everything you see being done in Africa, Gen21 shutting off their resources, it's happening here.
[00:47:56.571 --> 00:47:59.133]  The GMO attack, it's happening here as it is in Africa.
[00:47:59.634 --> 00:48:01.936]  Everybody's under attack by this new world order.
[00:48:03.593 --> 00:48:04.033]  Everybody!
[00:48:04.413 --> 00:48:09.755]  And that's why they put Obama in, for the left cover, give him the peace prize, so all of his new wars are peace.
[00:48:10.055 --> 00:48:26.781]  The UN invades, it uses NATO to do it, the UN gives the authorization, the UN has its own armies, they attack your country, they murder you, they take your land, and Angelina Jolie walks around and says, we're good, we're fighting somebody hadn't been seen in almost six years, who controlled a tiny area.
[00:48:27.819 --> 00:48:34.645]  It's just some simple boogeyman for the American people that can't even find Africa on a map and think that it's a country, not a continent.
[00:48:36.286 --> 00:48:36.587]  Okay?
[00:48:37.407 --> 00:48:38.028]  It's a hoax.
[00:48:38.288 --> 00:48:39.569]  And this is my statement on her.
[00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.892]  Arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes.
[00:48:43.213 --> 00:48:45.855]  Kony 2012 is the name of the article and it's got the videos.
[00:48:45.915 --> 00:48:46.836]  In fact, a new one I shot.
[00:48:48.097 --> 00:48:50.519]  Clearly there are bigger criminals in the United Nations.
[00:48:50.539 --> 00:48:51.280]  This is my statement.
[00:48:51.977 --> 00:48:57.640]  But nevertheless, she has been an enthusiastic proponent of all these so-called humanitarian wars.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.000]  War is peace, folks.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.700]  You heard of that before?
[00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:01.721]  In Libya and beyond.
[00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:06.043]  The United Nations' history of war crimes and massacres is legendary.
[00:49:06.063 --> 00:49:07.644]  We have a link to a big index of those.
[00:49:08.224 --> 00:49:18.809]  And just as Joseph Goebbels operated as a propaganda minister for the Nazis, Joe Lee, who is officially employed by the UN as an envoy, is their mouthpiece.
[00:49:20.279 --> 00:49:22.520]  It is her task to promote endless war.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:32.704]  It's time to call out the United Nations, by extension their poster girl, Jolie, for what they are, instruments of a corporate fascist world government.
[00:49:33.425 --> 00:49:42.689]  Yesterday morning while doing research into Kony 2012, I read a Hollywood Reporter article where Jolie was enthusiastically calling for an invasion to arrest Joseph Kony.
[00:49:42.749 --> 00:49:45.110]  That's just a cover for an invasion in Uganda.
[00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.591]  And the hypocrisy was just too much.
[00:49:48.643 --> 00:49:51.365]  And then I did some more research on her and confirmed she's even worse than I thought.
[00:49:52.486 --> 00:50:00.811]  The Western-backed dictator of Uganda has overseen the murder, we have links to that, of a thousand times the number of people than what Joseph Kony has killed.
[00:50:01.552 --> 00:50:06.695]  And so, by Angelina Jolie's benchmark for war crimes, she herself should be arrested.
[00:50:07.155 --> 00:50:14.000]  But therein lies the paradox, because the United Nations would have to arrest itself and its own minions.
[00:50:16.468 --> 00:50:45.454]  I mean, it's such a hoax, but only because of your willful ignorance, America and world, can you have a horrible, demonic front person like her pushing all these wars, wrecking Libya, mass death, country on fire, Al-Qaeda, women having burqas shoved on their heads, generally mutilated, Al-Qaeda slaughtering blacks by the tens of thousands, total bedlam, total bedlam in Egypt, total bedlam in Syria, total bedlam everywhere, with her hopping around looking like Medusa,
[00:50:47.402 --> 00:50:50.523]  There's a reason she plays witches in Beowulf and everything else.
[00:50:52.164 --> 00:50:53.324]  Because she is a witch!
[00:50:53.685 --> 00:50:56.706]  She's a globalist, big, fat, satanic devil!
[00:50:57.006 --> 00:50:57.826]  And I see her!
[00:50:58.126 --> 00:51:00.547]  And I want humanity to realize she's an enemy!
[00:51:01.088 --> 00:51:02.268]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.508 --> 00:51:12.952]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:51:13.172 --> 00:51:14.053]  InfoWars.com.
[00:51:14.893 --> 00:51:17.276]  Is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:51:17.637 --> 00:51:20.059]  But we can't do that without your help.

[00:51:31.673 --> 00:51:34.817]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:51:35.137 --> 00:51:40.758]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:41.258 --> 00:51:50.761]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:51.161 --> 00:51:52.341]  The war is here.
[00:51:52.661 --> 00:51:54.041]  It's an info war.
[00:51:54.562 --> 00:51:57.362]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:52:00.903 --> 00:52:02.845]  Are you having trouble paying your mortgage?
[00:52:03.145 --> 00:52:06.007]  Maybe your mortgage loan is upside down or in foreclosure.
[00:52:06.268 --> 00:52:08.229]  Maybe the bank already foreclosed on you.
[00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:11.192]  Don't sit around being a victim of bank fraud.

[00:54:07.586 --> 00:54:09.807]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:14.378 --> 00:54:20.862]  Okay, my friends, fellow liberty lovers across the world, I am going to give a toll-free number out.
[00:54:20.922 --> 00:54:21.883]  I'd love to hear from you.
[00:54:21.903 --> 00:54:27.726]  I want to do what I did yesterday again, because there's so many millions of people who never can get involved in the show.
[00:54:28.167 --> 00:54:29.908]  First-time callers, you're shot!
[00:54:30.048 --> 00:54:34.050]  I'd love to hear from you on any of the issues I've mentioned, or any news items you'd like to bring up.
[00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:35.651]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:35.711]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:43.986 --> 00:54:53.193]  In closing on Angelina Jolie, we can really use the energy of this Kony 2012 propaganda that she was using to promote.
[00:54:53.473 --> 00:54:55.875]  See, they say something's got to be done about Kony and then she comes out.
[00:54:55.995 --> 00:54:59.518]  Invasion of Uganda to help the government fight him.
[00:54:59.958 --> 00:55:01.880]  No one has ever even seen him in five, six years.
[00:55:02.816 --> 00:55:05.038]  It's just a way to go in and take over resources.
[00:55:05.058 --> 00:55:16.385]  And I have links to the UN in our articles, slaughtering and killing people, and private companies there for part of UN carbon agreements, killing people, pushing them off their land.
[00:55:17.046 --> 00:55:18.046]  You know, get off your farm.
[00:55:18.507 --> 00:55:21.308]  I've been here for, since the time before my grandfather's.
[00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:23.550]  Well, you're dead.
[00:55:25.611 --> 00:55:30.675]  But it doesn't matter, because the UN's the good guys, because they're fighting some guy named Kony, who pretty much doesn't exist like bin Laden.
[00:55:31.974 --> 00:55:37.046]  They love Phantom Boogeyman because they can later just kill some black guy and say that's him on the news.
[00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:40.553]  And they may be gearing up for that as some new Psy-Op like the Bin Laden thing.
[00:55:41.977 --> 00:55:47.981]  So this is what's going on, and by playing on extreme ignorance, that's how the system gets all of this done.
[00:55:48.822 --> 00:56:02.291]  So I want to challenge all of you to go get the videos that we've shot and the articles we've written on this subject, and to intensify your operations as well on the issue of impeaching Obama.
[00:56:04.281 --> 00:56:08.702]  Let me just go to InfoWars.com here to give you the actual headline.
[00:56:09.082 --> 00:56:11.623]  We've been writing articles about this since last Wednesday.
[00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:15.024]  Pentagon announces U.N.
[00:56:15.084 --> 00:56:16.024]  coup over America.
[00:56:16.824 --> 00:56:17.704]  Articles like that.
[00:56:18.744 --> 00:56:25.266]  But we have an article at InfoWars.com detailing that impeachment against
[00:56:27.682 --> 00:56:34.167]  Obama has been introduced with the bill number and the rest of it is finally getting picked up by places like World Net Daily.
[00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:36.509]  Obama impeachment bill now in Congress.
[00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:50.339]  Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina has introduced a resolution declaring that should the president use offensive military force without authorization or an act of Congress, it is the sense of the Congress that such an act would be impeachable, high crime and misdemeanor.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.001]  It violates Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[00:56:54.338 --> 00:56:56.799]  Again, you're like, Alex, you've been covering this since last Wednesday.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:57.660]  I know.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.162]  But WorldNetDaily's getting around to covering it now.
[00:57:01.842 --> 00:57:03.303]  Others are getting around to covering it.
[00:57:06.525 --> 00:57:08.346]  And we need to push this over the edge.
[00:57:09.807 --> 00:57:14.189]  Look, if he gets away with this, first it had to be a declaration of war.
[00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:15.730]  Then they had to authorize it.
[00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:20.153]  Then the President had to at least talk to Congress, even though that's still violating the law.
[00:57:20.173 --> 00:57:21.774]  And now he says, look, I follow the U.N.'
[00:57:21.754 --> 00:57:22.114]  's orders.
[00:57:22.915 --> 00:57:24.977]  I mean, let's really let that burn in.
[00:57:25.017 --> 00:57:26.518]  That actually is happening now.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.483]  And you notice where Angelina Jolie wants to be a boss is at the UN, because she's been told that's going to be the new boss over this country.
[00:57:35.224 --> 00:57:37.606]  That's the new consortium at the big megabanks run.
[00:57:40.107 --> 00:57:48.634]  By the way, this is all UN agenda 21, UNESCO garbage, CBS News reporting, incoming UC students may be asked to declare their sexual orientation.
[00:57:48.654 --> 00:57:49.674]  You're not allowed to be in college.
[00:57:49.694 --> 00:57:51.516]  See, they're going to be the sex police.
[00:57:52.651 --> 00:57:53.273]  Under all this.
[00:57:54.275 --> 00:57:58.986]  And then continuing, and if you're heterosexual and have a crime committed against you, you don't get the same protections.
[00:57:59.808 --> 00:58:02.213]  Bill introduced to regulate men's reproductive health.
[00:58:03.075 --> 00:58:22.779]  Now, if men want to get Viagra or anything else before getting a prescription for Viagra or other erectile dysfunction drugs, men would have to see a sex therapist, receive a cardiac stress test, and get a notarized affidavit signed by a sexual partner affirming impotency.
[00:58:24.159 --> 00:58:26.439]  This is the kind of laws they're trying to pass.
[00:58:27.439 --> 00:58:28.000]  Senate Bill 307.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:28.380]  So see,
[00:58:31.428 --> 00:58:32.949]  This is the sex police, folks.
[00:58:34.909 --> 00:58:37.430]  They want to be involved in every facet of your life.
[00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:38.130]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.951 --> 00:58:47.474]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.711 --> 00:58:54.934]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.254 --> 00:58:55.874]  Number one.
[00:58:56.174 --> 00:58:59.316]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.597 --> 00:59:00.157]  Number two.
[00:59:00.457 --> 00:59:05.000]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:05.781]  It's true.
[00:59:06.081 --> 00:59:10.644]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:11.504]  Number three.
[00:59:11.784 --> 00:59:15.066]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:19.069]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.269 --> 00:59:19.810]  Number 4.
[00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.433]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:26.217]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.517 --> 00:59:26.717]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.298 --> 00:59:31.222]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:36.208]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.488 --> 00:59:40.529]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.669 --> 00:59:42.230]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.530]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:47.291]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.311 --> 00:59:48.691]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.811 --> 00:59:54.693]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.744]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:11.205]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.986 --> 01:00:13.888]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.908 --> 01:00:17.151]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:21.795]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.296 --> 01:00:30.420]  Alright, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.722]  We're going to take 20-30 minutes of your calls and Patrick Henningsen is going to be joining us in studio.
[01:00:35.643 --> 01:00:40.985]  He happened to catch some TSA abuse on his way to Austin.
[01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:43.907]  Patrick Henningsen, writer for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:49.230]  I've already covered a bunch of news, but I've got a lot of other important news we're going to be getting into.
[01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:54.249]  Coming up, Sarkozy threatens to pull France from Europe.
[01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:57.511]  Visa free zone, Germany's threatening to leave the Euro.
[01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:05.234]  People are now being arrested with $1 million warrants and locked up for weeks for selling raw milk and stuff.
[01:01:05.274 --> 01:01:06.295]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[01:01:07.035 --> 01:01:10.716]  Meanwhile, companies are allowed to sell you pink slime to school children.
[01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:11.577]  It's very toxic.
[01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.117]  Not making this up.
[01:01:13.438 --> 01:01:18.340]  We're going to go over all of this coming up, but right now, let's go to Eddie in Wisconsin.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.060]  Eddie, welcome!
[01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:21.948]  Alex, how you doing today, brother?
[01:01:21.968 --> 01:01:22.869]  Pretty good, my friend.
[01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:28.950]  Hey, I just want to let you know up here in Wisconsin, man, we are alive and we are waking up, man.
[01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.711]  I just want to let you know that I'm spreading the word to everybody.
[01:01:33.251 --> 01:01:37.732]  Friends, family, people on the street, listen to Alex Jones.
[01:01:37.752 --> 01:01:39.152]  He knows what's going on, man.
[01:01:39.172 --> 01:01:41.893]  I just want to know we support you in Wisconsin, brother.
[01:01:42.654 --> 01:01:59.690]  Well, I want you to know that as this show explodes, I do it as a responsibility and as a sacred honor, and I do the best I can, and I am humbled, and I want everybody to know as this show explodes in size, I'm basically flying into the Death Star, so a lot of folks envy me and hate me because of that.
[01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:01.812]  Not my listeners, but their hosts and people.
[01:02:02.193 --> 01:02:07.277]  They need to understand this is a great danger I'm in, and I'm only alive because of your prayers.
[01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.479]  And the grace of God, and I am in God's hands.
[01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:17.223]  But there's a lot of attacks going on against me, because I am now a figurehead of liberty, whether I like it or not, and quite frankly, I don't.
[01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:26.768]  But know this, the truth is going forth thanks to people like you, and we're not going to be stopped, as long as we're bold in the face of this evil.
[01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:33.608]  I'm awake, down with the New World Order, and I say my prayers for you every day, brother.
[01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:34.689]  You keep rocking, alright?
[01:02:34.989 --> 01:02:35.350]  I need it.
[01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:36.010]  God bless you.
[01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:45.998]  I, you know, I've asked God to protect me and God's told me, people make fun of that, but you know, my discernment, that you've got to totally commit and get really hardcore the things you know are dangerous.
[01:02:46.299 --> 01:02:51.543]  Because even though you say you've got courage and don't care and don't have fear, you've been holding back, Jones!
[01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:53.785]  Well, not anymore!
[01:02:55.686 --> 01:02:57.348]  Not holding back anymore, okay?
[01:02:58.823 --> 01:03:03.325]  I've got all sorts of media operations I can throw at the globalists.
[01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.247]  I know how their system works, and I have been lazy.
[01:03:07.107 --> 01:03:11.329]  Years ago, I tried to stay small and actually fly under the radar.
[01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:16.992]  It was a form of subconscious cowardice that I have now psychoanalyzed myself, and I will not be part of.
[01:03:19.133 --> 01:03:20.394]  I will not be a coward.
[01:03:20.474 --> 01:03:21.314]  I will 110% engage the globalists.
[01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:25.459]  I want you to do that as well.
[01:03:25.479 --> 01:03:31.204]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back in a long segment, go to Tony, Perry, Michael, Dylan, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.967]  Then we got Patrick Henningsen coming on.
[01:03:33.987 --> 01:03:34.928]  We'll continue with calls.
[01:03:35.388 --> 01:03:39.011]  When Sean Stone's on with us, we'll just have a geopolitical discussion about the world.
[01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:41.694]  He is joining us via Skype, correct?
[01:03:41.714 --> 01:03:44.216]  Did we ever check that out and confirm that?
[01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:44.977]  Good.
[01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:48.260]  You know, I could have got Sean on.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.522]  Speaking of how I don't ever really try to game the media,
[01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:52.152]  I know him well.
[01:03:52.592 --> 01:03:54.754]  I'm in the upcoming Conspiracy Theory show with him.
[01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:59.418]  And I knew he was talking about to me converting to Islam, Shia Islam.
[01:04:01.385 --> 01:04:23.131]  And I had his home number Skype everything when he made the big announcement of course he'd actually Contacted me right before he made the announcement for some reason I just didn't jump on it didn't have him make the announcement of his conversion to Islam here on my show Whatever reason I just a lot of times even though I know something's me a big media event I just I just don't touch it for whatever reason and now is the time to get shown
[01:04:26.118 --> 01:04:27.939]  You know, probably, I don't know, like a hundred different shows.
[01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:28.940]  I mean, he's been everywhere.
[01:04:32.261 --> 01:04:33.342]  But I'm getting him on.
[01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:40.746]  I'm getting him on about what he saw in Iran.
[01:04:42.575 --> 01:04:45.898]  Not even so much about his conversion to Islamic faith.
[01:04:46.479 --> 01:04:46.779]  Islam.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.861]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:52.725]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:08.657]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.937 --> 01:05:10.299]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.479 --> 01:05:19.269]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:27.095]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:35.140]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.443]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:05.947]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.327 --> 01:08:08.610]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:14.764]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:15.384]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:15.404 --> 01:08:16.846]  Central at 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:08:16.906 --> 01:08:17.286]  Eastern.
[01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:24.733]  We're here live on the radio simulcasting in living video color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:24.853 --> 01:08:32.459]  I'm about to go right back to your phone calls, but I want to give folks a State of the Info War report here in just about 60 seconds.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.702]  For eight months we've had Info War's nightly news.
[01:08:35.782 --> 01:08:37.203]  We've beta tested the equipment.
[01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:45.640]  We've gotten a lot of our crew hired, and we have not missed one show in eight months, weeknights, seven o'clock.
[01:08:46.833 --> 01:08:55.237]  And the next time we take a pit stop, like we're about to do for the next week and a half, two weeks, we'll probably never be able to take a break again.
[01:08:55.678 --> 01:08:57.198]  I've got to get a few people hired.
[01:08:58.079 --> 01:08:59.940]  I've got to put in some new equipment.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:08.644]  And we were going to try to have our skeleton crew basically... Oh, that phone really is rattling, isn't it?
[01:09:11.165 --> 01:09:11.866]  It's Manco.
[01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:14.407]  Can't call him during a...
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.419]  You're in a radio interview?
[01:09:18.007 --> 01:09:23.330]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying, we have had tremendous success.
[01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.110]  It's gone very well.
[01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:29.353]  We're already picked up in the major cable system in England without even trying.
[01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:31.154]  A lot of cable systems are already picking it up here.
[01:09:31.815 --> 01:09:38.599]  So the next time we do a pit stop, we won't be able to because we've got to get the satellite link and all this other stuff set up.
[01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:41.841]  I've got to get two or three more people and then get them trained.
[01:09:41.881 --> 01:09:45.903]  I mean, it's a real growth curve when you're doing all this from scratch, as we've done.
[01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.966]  And really reinventing the wheel in a way.
[01:09:49.806 --> 01:09:54.708]  So for the next two weeks or so, we're going to have a few live shows on the Nightly News.
[01:09:54.728 --> 01:09:57.349]  We're going to have some special reports like the big Dave Mustaine interview.
[01:09:57.749 --> 01:10:08.453]  But because I've only got like four or five guys on the whole TV show, I need them to revamp graphics, do the interviews and the resumes, train people.
[01:10:08.814 --> 01:10:11.655]  I've got to shoot a video that is
[01:10:12.662 --> 01:10:22.227]  Going to be a promo for a contest I'm going to have to hire one or two new reporters.
[01:10:23.748 --> 01:10:32.393]  So I've just got to pull into the pit stop for a minute to get new tires and gas in the Formula One race car here to get it back on the road.
[01:10:32.433 --> 01:10:37.916]  In fact, I intended to go about two months and then have a week or two hiatus, but we just got so caught up in the treadmill.
[01:10:38.456 --> 01:10:42.019]  And the special reports and the guests and everything we're doing that I never did it.
[01:10:42.059 --> 01:10:43.520]  So we're eight months into this.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:50.044]  I would like to, by April or even before April, be able to revamp and relaunch.
[01:10:50.545 --> 01:10:56.609]  And then we'll go about four or five months again and then be done and actually formulate the show down to a set amount of time.
[01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:58.730]  Right now, some nights it's two hours long.
[01:10:58.811 --> 01:10:59.931]  Other nights it's 45 minutes.
[01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:01.192]  It's gonna be a set time.
[01:11:01.232 --> 01:11:02.453]  I've gotta figure all that out.
[01:11:02.953 --> 01:11:05.856]  And then we'll have one more short pit stop for about a week.
[01:11:06.556 --> 01:11:10.326]  When the show is officially launched, and then we can never stop.
[01:11:10.927 --> 01:11:12.190]  So, um...
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.091]  Even Glenn Beck launched his TV show, and then most days it isn't even a new show.
[01:11:17.391 --> 01:11:21.412]  With us, it's been eight months straight of nothing but new shows every evening.
[01:11:21.752 --> 01:11:31.275]  So again, for the next two weeks, we're going to take a pit stop, and there'll be the Dave Mustaine interview, a couple of shows where I have big guests booked, and I will be doing it.
[01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:39.157]  But most nights, it'll be old special reports, special compilations, and other things at PrisonPlanet.tv, where all my films are posted.
[01:11:41.174 --> 01:11:44.535]  We're almost nine years of material are and so much more.
[01:11:44.575 --> 01:11:46.816]  There will be other special reports that will also air.
[01:11:47.296 --> 01:11:50.817]  So it'll be like a special report instead of the nightly news that you'll see.
[01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:51.997]  So a lot of it will be new.
[01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:55.098]  Some of it will just be compilations of old stuff that we've aired.
[01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:56.778]  So that's coming up in the next two weeks.
[01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.699]  And then you'll see a relaunch of the news.
[01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:02.000]  It's been a giant success and we couldn't have done it without you.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.321]  We have the 15 day free trial running if you want to be a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:08.081]  Okay, Tony in New York.
[01:12:08.181 --> 01:12:08.702]  Welcome sir.
[01:12:08.762 --> 01:12:09.902]  Good to have you here with us today.
[01:12:10.811 --> 01:12:11.311]  How's it going?
[01:12:11.531 --> 01:12:11.911]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:12:12.691 --> 01:12:13.171]  That's good.
[01:12:13.332 --> 01:12:14.752]  I don't even know really where to start.
[01:12:14.812 --> 01:12:26.274]  So, uh, basically, um, I, I saw that you had talked about the Enterprise heading off to Iran and, um, I don't know if it made national news or not.
[01:12:26.314 --> 01:12:27.354]  I'm up near Syracuse.
[01:12:27.534 --> 01:12:34.356]  I'm pretty sure this was the same ship, but, uh, there was a, I think it was an Admiral or the Succulent Command, I think it was, of the Enterprise.
[01:12:34.376 --> 01:12:37.016]  He got lambasted probably six months, a year ago.
[01:12:37.076 --> 01:12:39.377]  They, they had a whole big deal about him, uh,
[01:12:40.034 --> 01:12:43.037]  You know, making videos and sexually harassing people or something.
[01:12:43.057 --> 01:12:43.977]  It was like a training video.
[01:12:44.017 --> 01:12:45.519]  It was supposed to be humorous or something.
[01:12:46.432 --> 01:12:47.772]  I'm not really sure the details.
[01:12:47.932 --> 01:12:50.133]  All I know is they love to blow up ships.
[01:12:50.193 --> 01:12:53.594]  At Pearl Harbor it was a bunch of battleships about to be decommissioned.
[01:12:53.614 --> 01:12:55.734]  They tied them up, had their carriers go and hide.
[01:12:56.214 --> 01:12:58.035]  Japanese subs attacked an hour before.
[01:12:58.075 --> 01:12:59.295]  They were still ordered to stand down.
[01:12:59.515 --> 01:13:00.155]  That's on record.
[01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:03.396]  It's not in any of the movies and stuff, but five subs attacked.
[01:13:03.836 --> 01:13:08.177]  One of them's at the Pacific War Museum in Fredericksburg, and they just admit it there.
[01:13:08.497 --> 01:13:09.677]  But it's hidden in plain view.
[01:13:10.097 --> 01:13:11.638]  An hour and 15 minutes before,
[01:13:13.254 --> 01:13:17.055]  The subs start attacking and still the base was told to stand down?
[01:13:17.075 --> 01:13:18.535]  I mean, it's admitted there.
[01:13:18.555 --> 01:13:19.856]  It's an incredible museum, by the way.
[01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:25.797]  They got the shells of Fat Boy, the A-bomb.
[01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:30.638]  I mean, it's one of the best military museums I've ever seen out in Fredericksburg.
[01:13:30.658 --> 01:13:35.279]  But that said, Hidden in Plain View is one of the midget subs that attacked, and everybody's like,
[01:13:36.021 --> 01:13:37.402]  Well, that's kind of what I was wondering.
[01:13:37.422 --> 01:13:41.744]  I was wondering if that was almost a preemptive sort of a thing where they, you know, kind of got him out.
[01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:11.602]  Basically lambasted him and moved him off the ship and I'm not really sure what they did to his career.
[01:14:12.236 --> 01:14:18.161]  But I'm thinking, you know, maybe he was one of the people that was refusing to, you know, kind of go along with the whole U.N.
[01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:19.403]  New World Order kind of stuff.
[01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:20.744]  Oh, yeah, they've been served.
[01:14:20.764 --> 01:14:23.486]  The last two chairmen wouldn't go along with it and were kicked out.
[01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:27.490]  The last head of CENTCOM, Fox Fallon, refused.
[01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.452]  I mean, it's not speculation.
[01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:33.836]  We know they've been purging the upper ranks because most of these guys are not traitors.
[01:14:34.176 --> 01:14:35.217]  They've got grandchildren.
[01:14:35.257 --> 01:14:36.058]  They love America.
[01:14:37.038 --> 01:14:41.642]  And they may have bent the rules for the United States, but they're not going to do it under any New World Order command.
[01:14:42.403 --> 01:14:45.926]  And so this is the big time to make a decision which side you're on.
[01:14:45.966 --> 01:14:46.446]  Good points.
[01:14:46.826 --> 01:14:47.607]  Good to hear from you.
[01:14:47.867 --> 01:14:49.589]  I mean, the global government's out in the open now.
[01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.991]  I've made my decision.
[01:14:52.031 --> 01:14:52.551]  I'm against it.
[01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:55.333]  Dylan in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:14:55.393 --> 01:14:55.734]  Welcome.
[01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:58.796]  Hey, great to talk to you, sir.
[01:14:59.256 --> 01:14:59.597]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:59.617 --> 01:15:00.157]  Good to talk to you.
[01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:00.738]  What's on your mind?
[01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:06.225]  Can I tell you a story about something that happened to me in Sarasota with the TSA?
[01:15:06.826 --> 01:15:09.326]  It was something I had never, ever heard of happening.
[01:15:09.767 --> 01:15:17.049]  Let me write this down because every time we get a call about some new perversion that they're doing, I look it up and somebody else has complained about it.
[01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:19.290]  So nothing we've heard has not been true.
[01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:20.850]  It's always worse, no matter how crazy.
[01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:22.911]  Tell me what happened in Sarasota, Florida.
[01:15:24.136 --> 01:15:25.157]  Yeah, Sarasota, Florida.
[01:15:25.297 --> 01:15:33.943]  We went through the scanner, or my family went through the security checkpoint, and I got my dad to not go through the scanner with me.
[01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:39.066]  And we both had to be patted down, and it was just ridiculous.
[01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:46.792]  And then we went inside after the checkpoint, and we were in the airport, went to the Starbucks there.
[01:15:46.912 --> 01:15:50.574]  No, and they came and harassed you at the Starbucks, or then again at the gate?
[01:15:50.594 --> 01:15:51.395]  That happens all the time.
[01:15:52.563 --> 01:15:55.125]  No, no, not even that.
[01:15:55.246 --> 01:15:57.868]  Everyone had bought coffee because it's four in the morning, you know?
[01:15:58.549 --> 01:16:04.094]  And there is this lady who's going around with a, like, a Q-tip swab.
[01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:09.639]  And she was dipping it into everybody's coffee mug.
[01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:12.642]  And keep in mind, this is after the security checkpoint.
[01:16:13.393 --> 01:16:27.238]  This is inside of the airport and she's testing all... Yeah, I've seen them pull people over in the airport, you know, like they're a cop and they just come over and usually it's good-looking blonde, literally, that they want to get their little hands on and they do gropedowns.
[01:16:27.258 --> 01:16:29.378]  Oh, you're hot, let's do a little groping.
[01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.319]  I mean, literally, they've been caught doing it.
[01:16:31.699 --> 01:16:33.099]  Oh my gosh, you're completely gorgeous.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.060]  Gropedown time.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.841]  And they also like to harass old people for whatever reason.
[01:16:36.861 --> 01:16:38.781]  If you're in a wheelchair or whatever, look out.
[01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:39.842]  Wolves attack.
[01:16:40.902 --> 01:16:43.963]  I want to hear your story, but I have seen him swabbing luggage and stuff inside.
[01:16:44.263 --> 01:16:48.124]  You're saying she comes up with her dirty gloves and is sticking it in your coffee?
[01:16:49.245 --> 01:16:50.385]  Yes, exactly.
[01:16:50.445 --> 01:16:59.128]  And then she'd take it over to this guy who was testing it for, I don't know what, flavor or explosives or whatever.
[01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:00.529]  And this was a TSA person?
[01:17:01.429 --> 01:17:04.210]  Yeah, these were both TSA people inside the airport.
[01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:11.102]  And so I couldn't handle it, so I just dumped my coffee out because I was with my parents, didn't want to make a scene.
[01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:12.063]  Let me stop you.
[01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:12.683]  Describe this.
[01:17:12.723 --> 01:17:15.946]  So a person in a TSA outfit comes over.
[01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:19.648]  Now the Q-tip, were they sticking it in and then throwing it away, or were they just going along?
[01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:21.189]  Because they already could care less.
[01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:25.792]  They wear the gloves to protect themselves, but don't change them until they've searched like 400 people they had met.
[01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:31.616]  They make you take your shoes off and walk through the flesh-eating MRSA and the fungus and everything.
[01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:33.998]  Describe this for me blow by blow.
[01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:43.897]  Well, they'd take the q-tip and they would dip it into the mouthpiece of, you know, of the Starbucks cup.
[01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:47.120]  Sure, the plastic cover, a little hole, and they wouldn't ask.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.802]  They'd just come over and stick it in your coffee.
[01:17:48.962 --> 01:17:49.662]  I'd be like, no!
[01:17:50.964 --> 01:17:51.484]  Exactly!
[01:17:52.385 --> 01:17:54.487]  And then she'd go back and test it for
[01:17:55.163 --> 01:17:56.805]  Explosives at this other place.
[01:17:59.188 --> 01:17:59.849]  And it was ridiculous.
[01:17:59.869 --> 01:18:02.472]  So I went up and asked this man, I was like, so what just happened?
[01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:03.773]  Did that really just happen?
[01:18:04.134 --> 01:18:07.838]  And he goes, literally, this is a quote, he goes, Oh, it's just more protection.
[01:18:09.929 --> 01:18:11.771]  Well, see, they want to make it ridiculous.
[01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:13.953]  In the military, they make you do weird chants.
[01:18:14.674 --> 01:18:24.144]  It's kind of like at Full Metal Jacket, that's based on a composite of true stories, where they make them grab themselves sexually and say, this is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun.
[01:18:24.624 --> 01:18:25.966]  And people say, why do you do that?
[01:18:26.026 --> 01:18:29.129]  Well, it's about the troops do what they're told, no matter how stupid it sounds.
[01:18:29.429 --> 01:18:31.031]  When I say jump, you say how high.
[01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:32.772]  And that's all this is.
[01:18:33.493 --> 01:18:35.055]  And I'm going to have to look into this.
[01:18:35.135 --> 01:18:39.579]  I've seen them swabbing people's hands and stuff, you know, all over the airport.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:43.744]  But I've seen them take water away that was already bought through the checkpoint.
[01:18:44.084 --> 01:18:45.746]  Again, it's all about teaching you you're guilty.
[01:18:46.526 --> 01:18:48.567]  I wish you would have gotten photos or video of this.
[01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:58.632]  Other people, if you've seen this, please email us, please Twitter, you know, make comments at RealAlexJones at Twitter, because I want to look into this.
[01:18:58.652 --> 01:19:01.614]  This is definitely newsworthy if they're now getting into your Starbucks coffee.
[01:19:03.775 --> 01:19:04.275]  Definitely.
[01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:07.217]  So they came over to you and you just said no and dumped it out?
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.843]  Yes, I wasn't going to be able to handle it.
[01:19:10.903 --> 01:19:14.446]  I was with my parents and I just didn't want to create a scene.
[01:19:15.107 --> 01:19:18.971]  By the way, we made jokes about him wanting to do chest x-rays to make sure there's not breast bombs.
[01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:21.193]  They've now announced that in Australia and the U.S.
[01:19:21.533 --> 01:19:22.394]  They want to start pilots.
[01:19:22.715 --> 01:19:23.556]  And I'm not joking!
[01:19:24.096 --> 01:19:28.617]  They're now talking about in the strip searches they may start actually doing a rectal exam.
[01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:39.019]  I saw that a few weeks ago where they're discussing taser bracelets around your arms, Homeland Security officially is, where everyone gets a taser, and actually putting their fingers in your hind end now.
[01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:43.020]  I'm sorry to talk like that, folks, but I think most Americans will actually bend over.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.361]  That should be the new American flag, is like a big, fat,
[01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:52.376]  Janet Reno type with a plastic glove on their hand and a man.
[01:19:52.556 --> 01:19:57.245]  Well, I'm sorry I just it's unbelievable and people are like this is improper to talk about they're doing it.
[01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:59.729]  We got to stop it We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.789 --> 01:20:00.270]  Stay with us
[01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.717]  I had tried everything.
[01:20:02.777 --> 01:20:07.801]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:12.665]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:20:13.005 --> 01:20:19.350]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:30.214]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:20:30.955 --> 01:20:35.057]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:38.378]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:20:38.718 --> 01:20:41.360]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.741]  Now that's results.
[01:20:43.142 --> 01:20:49.527]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[01:22:01.613 --> 01:22:04.756]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:22:04.976 --> 01:22:13.003]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:22:13.183 --> 01:22:18.307]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:22:18.487 --> 01:22:21.390]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.352]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:28.596]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:22:30.537 --> 01:22:34.279]  In a coming-apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:22:34.539 --> 01:22:38.280]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:43.742]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.
[01:22:43.922 --> 01:22:47.304]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.
[01:22:47.464 --> 01:22:50.725]  Find a dealer or shop online at atwoodrope.net.
[01:22:50.905 --> 01:22:55.507]  Enter promo code RADIO to receive 100 feet of 550 paracord free with purchase.
[01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:58.488]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:23:02.967 --> 01:23:07.690]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:09.871]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:23:10.011 --> 01:23:13.192]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:23:13.533 --> 01:23:20.716]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:25.219]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:23:25.499 --> 01:23:31.242]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:23:31.582 --> 01:23:33.163]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:39.708]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:48.694]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[01:23:48.995 --> 01:23:54.459]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[01:23:54.739 --> 01:23:57.681]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:01.174 --> 01:24:14.944]  Alright, this is a short segment.
[01:24:14.964 --> 01:24:19.588]  We're going to get into some geopolitical developments with our guest, Patrick Henningsen.
[01:24:20.008 --> 01:24:27.554]  But then, he's got an unbelievable TSA story that is definitely newsworthy with a gentleman missing all four of his limbs.
[01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:31.796]  The TSA knows who he is, harasses him every time.
[01:24:31.836 --> 01:24:33.536]  He's a well-known motivational speaker.
[01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:36.418]  And we've got some video, too, of where you interviewed him.
[01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.979]  But I want to get this guy on the show tomorrow if we can.
[01:24:39.299 --> 01:24:39.799]  Incredible.
[01:24:40.079 --> 01:24:44.641]  So we'll talk a little bit now, get into that story, then back into other events and take some calls.
[01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:45.682]  How long are you in town?
[01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:50.604]  I'm in Austin for a week, until Sunday.
[01:24:50.984 --> 01:24:54.806]  And I'm going back to Phoenix to stay with my family for a few weeks.
[01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:56.387]  But you've got some family with you today.
[01:24:56.708 --> 01:25:00.872]  Yeah, my brother's here for South by Southwest Interactive Digital Festival.
[01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:01.693]  Really nice fellow.
[01:25:01.713 --> 01:25:05.557]  Well, perhaps we should have you back for a full hour on some other subjects later in the week.
[01:25:05.577 --> 01:25:05.997]  Definitely.
[01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:07.419]  I don't want to keep you from all the work you're doing.
[01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:13.245]  Okay, Patrick, investigative journalist, writer for Infowars.com, written for a lot of other big outfits.
[01:25:13.805 --> 01:25:16.889]  You have been really focusing on these proxy wars.
[01:25:17.429 --> 01:25:20.211]  To invade Libya, now Syria, Uganda.
[01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:26.355]  I mean, Obama is literally launching World War III by proxy, but no one's resisting it.
[01:25:27.745 --> 01:25:48.412]  Yeah, I mean, the thing that's really, I mean, I grew up in America, Alex, so I live in England for 18 years and I come back to the United States and I don't watch CNN or any of the major networks, so the thing that's really a trip when you come back to the States is the way the media operates here, just watching CNN every morning.
[01:25:48.992 --> 01:25:57.195]  And compared to British press coverage on international issues is very very partisan in favor of the establishment.
[01:25:57.595 --> 01:26:02.416]  America in comparison is like is like partisan on steroids.
[01:26:02.796 --> 01:26:08.798]  I'm watching CNN this morning and you would have no idea of anything outside of a very narrow band.
[01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:11.639]  And I didn't realize how powerful the media in this country.
[01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:15.440]  I don't know if it's the flicker rate of the televisions or what but it's more intense.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.822]  Well, it's totally dumbed down, where they just say, Badman Coney, kill Africa!
[01:26:20.082 --> 01:26:20.242]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.462 --> 01:26:23.423]  It's like, murder, kill, invade, peace, ahhh!
[01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:27.265]  And then, no one can even find Coney, it's just like, Badman, kill!
[01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:33.747]  At South by Southwest Interactive, the Invisible Children was this campaign with Joseph Coney.
[01:26:33.767 --> 01:26:36.288]  No, it's being pushed force-fed everywhere, Bill Gates is involved.
[01:26:36.288 --> 01:26:41.990]  They're talking about it there as a victory for social media and for social networking.
[01:26:42.651 --> 01:26:44.852]  Well, anything South by Southwest is involved in.
[01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:46.552]  Louis Black is a big globalist here in town.
[01:26:46.572 --> 01:26:48.353]  Well, that's his fake name, but the guy that runs it.
[01:26:48.933 --> 01:27:05.340]  So, you know, I was talking to a lot of really nice people, really good people from good families, well informed, but when it comes to the issue of social media and helping children in Africa and, you know, Ugandan butchers, you can't even talk to them about it without fear of just being completely
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.221]  Coney hasn't been seen in six years.
[01:27:08.581 --> 01:27:11.062]  The president has killed millions of people on his western back.
[01:27:11.082 --> 01:27:14.003]  And you're like, hey, you know, this is just a reason to kill people for their land.
[01:27:14.283 --> 01:27:15.223]  Here's even the New York Times.
[01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:16.784]  They're like, shut up, fascist pig!
[01:27:17.384 --> 01:27:17.944]  Coney!
[01:27:18.244 --> 01:27:18.545]  Oh, really?
[01:27:18.585 --> 01:27:19.205]  Where's Coney?
[01:27:19.965 --> 01:27:20.805]  Where is he in the region?
[01:27:21.045 --> 01:27:22.586]  Well, he's up there by Libya.
[01:27:22.686 --> 01:27:23.226]  No, no, no, no.
[01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:24.467]  This is in the middle of Africa.
[01:27:24.847 --> 01:27:26.107]  Do you know about the history of it?
[01:27:26.127 --> 01:27:27.048]  They just know nothing.
[01:27:27.068 --> 01:27:28.048]  They're just like idiots.
[01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:31.190]  Yeah, Musevini declared himself president for life.
[01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:36.274]  I mean, they talk about Vladimir Putin as if he's some iron-fisted dictator.
[01:27:36.574 --> 01:27:39.516]  He's only been in power in Russia for 10 years.
[01:27:39.876 --> 01:27:44.800]  Musevini is approaching 30 years as the head of Africa, and he replaced Idi Amin.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.822]  Uh, so the, you know, the way that they frame, uh, who the U.S.'
[01:27:49.802 --> 01:27:50.422]  's friends are.
[01:27:50.522 --> 01:27:54.584]  If there's a president for life, I guarantee you they have a direct line to the White House anywhere in the world.
[01:27:54.704 --> 01:28:04.369]  Azerbaijan, uh... Well, my point is, is that the globalists are getting rid of my liberties and freedoms while lecturing me all day about how they need to attack all these countries.
[01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:08.411]  And it's always cynically about a takeover.
[01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:09.532]  I mean, look at Libya.
[01:28:09.572 --> 01:28:10.813]  Boy, we were right on that front.
[01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:12.014]  They have wrecked that place.
[01:28:12.174 --> 01:28:14.376]  Yeah, Libya is destroyed.
[01:28:14.796 --> 01:28:20.120]  Ask anybody in Libya if life is better before the NATO no-fly zone or after that.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.261]  They don't have running water.
[01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:24.503]  They have electrical rolling blackouts in most cities.
[01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:26.485]  And now they've partitioned the country.
[01:28:26.905 --> 01:28:30.908]  And the Al-Qaeda fighters have killed, what is it, like 30,000 blacks alone, lining them up, shooting them.
[01:28:31.248 --> 01:28:32.249]  But that's trendy, though.
[01:28:32.309 --> 01:28:33.430]  Angelina Jolie said it was good.
[01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:37.011]  Attacking Libya, good, because she's trending and has a chicken neck.
[01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:38.771]  Yeah, that's what you hear from people.
[01:28:39.431 --> 01:28:43.152]  Yes, but, but, yes, but, yes, but, yes, but she has a chicken neck!
[01:28:43.413 --> 01:28:44.213]  He's a dictator.
[01:28:44.393 --> 01:28:45.013]  He's a thug.
[01:28:45.113 --> 01:28:46.733]  Assad, Assad, a dictator.
[01:28:46.994 --> 01:28:47.694]  Oh, what about the women?
[01:28:47.714 --> 01:28:51.995]  But if you look like a reanimated corpse and are a chicken neck and walk around saying I'm liberal all day, it's okay.
[01:28:52.415 --> 01:29:01.499]  Yeah, I mean, they rally around these... I mean, Angelina Jolie, God bless her soul, she's been photographed so many times with African children on each hand.
[01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:04.580]  She's a spokesperson for the UN or something like this.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:06.580]  Now she's an envoy, yeah.
[01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.541]  And she's an envoy.
[01:29:07.821 --> 01:29:09.262]  And it's all about the human rights.
[01:29:09.282 --> 01:29:10.542]  This is a catch-all tag.
[01:29:10.902 --> 01:29:11.502]  Human rights.
[01:29:11.582 --> 01:29:15.424]  And the UN is supposed to be enforcing human rights all around the world.
[01:29:15.644 --> 01:29:18.045]  All this is is an entree to a world government
[01:29:18.525 --> 01:29:25.109]  And using things like human rights and human intervention to impose much more specific social engineering goals.
[01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:26.110]  Oh, they kill them!
[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:28.191]  The UN lines them up and kills people!
[01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:30.993]  But their spokeswoman is with little kids!
[01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.507]  So it's okay, Patrick.
[01:29:33.727 --> 01:29:38.751]  Yeah, I thought Angelina Jolie, she looked like Michael Jackson or any of these people.
[01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:44.276]  They looked human when they started out in the show business and now you look at them and I guess they've had so much work done or whatever.
[01:29:44.956 --> 01:29:47.378]  Well, I mean, she is definitely a demonic pig.
[01:29:47.398 --> 01:29:50.160]  I hope she enjoys sleeping with the New World Order.
[01:29:51.622 --> 01:29:53.163]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.103 --> 01:29:56.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.842 --> 01:30:07.826]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:30:08.066 --> 01:30:25.696]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:30:25.957 --> 01:30:30.079]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:30:30.339 --> 01:30:31.920]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:39.966]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:30:40.266 --> 01:30:46.390]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:47.631]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:48.611]  It's incredible.

[01:31:00.619 --> 01:31:01.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.262]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.502 --> 01:31:12.144]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.524 --> 01:31:17.606]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:22.788]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.308 --> 01:31:30.252]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.432 --> 01:31:31.332]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:37.916]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.236 --> 01:31:41.097]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:41.437 --> 01:31:44.579]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:44.799]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:52.443 --> 01:31:56.966]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:57.286 --> 01:31:59.747]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:01.188 --> 01:32:15.656]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:20.339]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.351 --> 01:32:33.361]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.122 --> 01:32:41.367]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:42.068 --> 01:32:51.657]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.437 --> 01:32:55.700]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.361 --> 01:32:59.484]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:14.937 --> 01:33:16.117]  Absolutely not.
[01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.498]  Say it again.
[01:33:19.578 --> 01:33:22.959]  What is it good for?
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.440]  Absolutely not.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:28.561]  War, I despise.
[01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:33.543]  Because it means destruction of innocent lives.
[01:33:34.523 --> 01:33:38.024]  War means tears in thousands of mothers' eyes.
[01:33:38.444 --> 01:33:41.865]  When their sons go off the bank and lose their lives.
[01:33:42.443 --> 01:33:45.845]  You know, my point is, if it's a war to defend our country, I'm all for it.
[01:33:45.865 --> 01:33:51.288]  But these wars are for big megacorporations that are openly establishing world government.
[01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:54.550]  And our basic liberties are being overthrown in this country.
[01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:59.253]  Now, I want to go to some of these calls for Patrick Henningsen, reporter, who's here with us in studio.
[01:33:59.293 --> 01:34:08.299]  Sean Stone at 8 after next hour will be joining us to talk about a host of news issues, including what he's witnessed recently in Iran.
[01:34:10.876 --> 01:34:16.179]  But I wanted to talk to Patrick Henningsen about something that just happened.
[01:34:16.799 --> 01:34:21.701]  When he was flying back out here from Sing Family in Phoenix, he ran into Jeff Lewis.
[01:34:21.761 --> 01:34:28.385]  And if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, we'll put this article up on screen for folks.
[01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:32.647]  Jeff is a motivational speaker.
[01:34:33.786 --> 01:34:57.182]  and he's missing both his legs and both of his arms and you can just again Google Jeff Lewis quadruple amputee has a inspiring story and we can put that article again up on screen for folks so people can see him but Patrick Henningsen
[01:34:58.689 --> 01:34:58.929]  I think?
[01:35:17.062 --> 01:35:20.204]  You know, of airplanes even after they're on and searching them.
[01:35:20.865 --> 01:35:23.227]  Searching people at the gate.
[01:35:24.228 --> 01:35:29.452]  We have seen the TSA taking old ladies behind closed doors and strip searching them and then lying about it.
[01:35:30.252 --> 01:35:45.704]  We've seen the TSA abusing women and raping women in parking lots and involved in robbing people and groping and not changing their gloves and body scanning people and saving the images and being caught lying and groping people's genitals.
[01:35:46.585 --> 01:35:49.068]  But I've seen them with old folks in wheelchairs.
[01:35:49.088 --> 01:35:52.431]  You know, we've heard about a 95-year-old woman with cancer going to Michigan, can't walk.
[01:35:52.771 --> 01:35:55.334]  They make passengers get her up after yelling at her.
[01:35:55.354 --> 01:35:56.795]  I mean, we've seen all this.
[01:35:56.815 --> 01:36:01.640]  And I've seen them with people with oxygen tanks who look like they're about to die, screaming at them, saying, what's this?
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:02.621]  I mean, they...
[01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:07.747]  It's the worst customer service I've ever seen in my life, and they want to break our will.
[01:36:08.148 --> 01:36:13.977]  Tell folks the story, blow by blow, of what you witnessed with Jeff Lewis, what you saw.
[01:36:14.037 --> 01:36:19.965]  And again, we're going to pull up this article in color and put his photo up for everybody on screen before we go to this video report that you did with him.
[01:36:20.666 --> 01:36:22.987]  Well, I got into Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix.
[01:36:23.047 --> 01:36:29.169]  I was on my way to Austin on Southwest Airlines and so I'm going through a TSA security.
[01:36:29.269 --> 01:36:31.509]  I haven't been through TSA security in a couple of years.
[01:36:32.009 --> 01:36:34.510]  So this is, I was kind of like to see what's going on.
[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:50.195]  Anyway, I get into the line and I put my stuff in the little trays, push the stuff through, took all my my little toothpaste out and put it in the little Ziploc plastic bags, my toothbrush, made sure I didn't have any dangerous, you know, bomb-making material in my bag.
[01:36:50.935 --> 01:36:54.217]  And then they asked me to go through the naked body scanner.
[01:36:54.237 --> 01:36:54.858]  Okay?
[01:36:55.298 --> 01:36:56.979]  I have yet to go through one of these.
[01:36:57.039 --> 01:36:58.320]  I've refused a couple of times.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.681]  So I asked, can I have a full pat down, please?
[01:37:01.302 --> 01:37:03.023]  And he said, fine.
[01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.564]  He said, can you step over here, sir?
[01:37:05.124 --> 01:37:06.084]  I have my shoes off.
[01:37:06.405 --> 01:37:10.727]  I'm waiting on this carpet and waiting for... It's all meant to make you feel insecure.
[01:37:10.787 --> 01:37:11.868]  Your shoes are off.
[01:37:12.668 --> 01:37:14.029]  Your stuff's been taken away.
[01:37:14.049 --> 01:37:14.630]  They're there.
[01:37:15.675 --> 01:37:26.119]  And so, they put me off to the side, and then another gentleman comes and takes me to the back area, and they have all my stuff in all the trays, they put it down on the table, and they say, can you wait here, sir?
[01:37:26.719 --> 01:37:40.143]  And while I'm waiting there, with my shoes off, I see a guy, and he's an amputee, and I realize this isn't just someone who's lost an arm, this is someone who's lost both arms and both legs.
[01:37:40.504 --> 01:37:44.265]  He's sitting down there, and he looks at me, and he says to me, he's like, ooh, what have you done?
[01:37:44.765 --> 01:37:49.610]  And I said, well, I refuse to go through the body scanner and I've asked for a full pat down.
[01:37:50.151 --> 01:37:52.173]  And he said, yeah, they're giving me the third degree too.
[01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.175]  And honestly, Alex, I thought he was joking.
[01:37:54.856 --> 01:37:56.518]  You know, it was a situation surreal.
[01:37:56.558 --> 01:38:00.001]  I couldn't believe that he's telling me that he's going to get the third degree from T.F.
[01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:01.603]  And you've been in England the last few years.
[01:38:01.623 --> 01:38:02.504]  You haven't witnessed this.
[01:38:02.804 --> 01:38:02.985]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.105 --> 01:38:04.126]  The escalation.
[01:38:04.366 --> 01:38:04.926]  Hmm.
[01:38:05.006 --> 01:38:08.368]  And it's escalated over there as well in European flights.
[01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.109]  But that's another story.
[01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:17.174]  So I'm sitting here, and sure enough, as I was talking to him, the TSA guy comes over with this explosive swab.
[01:38:17.834 --> 01:38:19.775]  And he starts swabbing his legs.
[01:38:21.156 --> 01:38:40.992]  I'm doing some kind of a sensor test on his arms I have no idea what he was doing and he says yeah he's all this happens to me every time I come through Phoenix and Jeff Lewis amazing guy straight away when he talked to this guy he's got a great sense of humor a lot of people would be upset about what's going on this guy's exceptional because he's got a good sense of humor about what's happened to him
[01:38:41.232 --> 01:38:43.453]  He's missing both legs, both arms.
[01:38:43.493 --> 01:38:44.794]  He's a motivational speaker.
[01:38:45.274 --> 01:38:45.834]  He's healthy.
[01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:46.915]  He exercises.
[01:38:48.436 --> 01:38:54.839]  Tell us more about this guy because we've got a short video clip where you interviewed him there at the airport because the key you were telling me is they know him.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.220]  Yeah, they know who he is.
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:56.740]  Sorry, it's the law.
[01:39:12.214 --> 01:39:15.818]  I challenged a security agent at Heathrow Airport in London.
[01:39:16.138 --> 01:39:17.419]  They took three books off me.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.521]  I lost three books on my way here.
[01:39:19.902 --> 01:39:21.083]  Plus a USB stick.
[01:39:21.143 --> 01:39:22.144]  So the books are evil?
[01:39:22.484 --> 01:39:22.884]  I don't know.
[01:39:23.065 --> 01:39:27.068]  Well now TSA is taking USBs and laptops and downloading their contents.
[01:39:27.148 --> 01:39:27.409]  I don't know.
[01:39:27.449 --> 01:39:31.012]  I didn't get my stuff back and I didn't realize it until I got on the plane it was missing.
[01:39:31.252 --> 01:39:31.432]  Okay?
[01:39:31.452 --> 01:39:32.794]  Because they stripped everything out of my bag.
[01:39:32.814 --> 01:39:33.895]  Well you know books are evil.
[01:39:33.915 --> 01:39:35.136]  That's a sign of being a terrorist.
[01:39:35.396 --> 01:39:39.178]  And so the woman says to me, I'm sorry, she was apologetic, I'm sorry, it's the law.
[01:39:39.459 --> 01:39:40.319]  It's like this everywhere.
[01:39:40.339 --> 01:39:43.081]  And I said to her, I said, hold on, it's not like this everywhere.
[01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:46.003]  I was working and living in Saudi Arabia, okay?
[01:39:46.283 --> 01:39:52.287]  They have a genuine terrorist problem in Saudi Arabia, a real problem, that they're running a dictatorship there.
[01:39:52.347 --> 01:39:54.728]  So they have real terrorists there who want to overthrow the government.
[01:39:55.348 --> 01:39:59.471]  You can smoke a cigarette walking through the airport, you walk through a metal detector, and that's it.
[01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:02.334]  That's because they're actually profiling, going after real folks.
[01:40:02.435 --> 01:40:07.300]  This is about teaching us that we're all guilty until proven slaves.
[01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:08.982]  It's not even guilty until proven innocent.
[01:40:09.283 --> 01:40:13.188]  We're guilty, we're suspects, we're bad, but they, the government, are good.
[01:40:13.408 --> 01:40:14.830]  But tell us more about this guy.
[01:40:15.559 --> 01:40:20.924]  Jeff Lewis, the first thing I said to him, I was a bit naive, I said, are you a veteran?
[01:40:21.264 --> 01:40:22.605]  And he said, no, I hate animals.
[01:40:23.346 --> 01:40:26.829]  So straight away you knew this guy had a pretty good sense of humor.
[01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:29.131]  Not a veterinarian, yeah.
[01:40:29.151 --> 01:40:31.673]  Not a veterinarian, but a brilliant guy.
[01:40:32.233 --> 01:40:39.319]  And he's a retired math teacher and he lost his arms and legs and was back to work in nine weeks.
[01:40:39.739 --> 01:40:41.381]  How did he lose them?
[01:40:41.861 --> 01:40:49.726]  I think he had a serious medical infection that was running really... Yeah, that happens a lot and then they have to cut everything off.
[01:40:49.766 --> 01:40:50.367]  ...real rapidly.
[01:40:50.387 --> 01:40:56.651]  In fact, there's a 7'7 basketball player, tallest player in the country, Kenny George, lost part of his foot from MSR.
[01:40:58.112 --> 01:40:58.672]  Yeah, MSR.
[01:40:58.872 --> 01:41:07.257]  MRSA, yeah, the flesh-eating bacteria that is exploding, they admit, because thousands a day walk to the airports where the bacteria are mixing and it's getting on people's feet.
[01:41:07.577 --> 01:41:09.418]  He might have gotten it walking through an airport.
[01:41:09.738 --> 01:41:15.201]  Listen, they're wearing gloves to protect themselves from you, but they wear them for an entire shift, for three hours.
[01:41:15.621 --> 01:41:19.823]  Hundreds of people, they go in your pants, and then, oh, but you don't matter, see?
[01:41:20.463 --> 01:41:21.784]  And they have you walk through that.
[01:41:21.884 --> 01:41:26.026]  See, the crimes they commit, the radiation, all of it.
[01:41:26.286 --> 01:41:31.708]  He told me that he got stopped because he had a, they tested his feet for, they found explosive on his shoes.
[01:41:32.269 --> 01:41:37.751]  This is before his accident, before his accident, and there was ammonium nitrate on his shoes.
[01:41:38.251 --> 01:41:39.672]  Oh, before he got the flesh eating?
[01:41:39.812 --> 01:41:39.992]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.132 --> 01:41:41.312]  He probably got it at the airport.
[01:41:41.433 --> 01:41:50.737]  Who knows, but because he walked on grass that had fertilizer on it, it set off the explosive detector on the device at the airport.
[01:41:51.917 --> 01:41:58.206]  Well, again, even with real, rare terrorism, you've got a 1 out of 3 million plus chance of being killed by it.
[01:41:58.527 --> 01:42:00.309]  And most of it, as we know, Patrick, is staged.
[01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:04.815]  Now, I'm going to play this video clip here, but the point is that this is what the zero tolerance is about.
[01:42:05.581 --> 01:42:08.583]  Oh, you've got a Luden's cough drop, you know, here in the fourth grade.
[01:42:08.984 --> 01:42:10.405]  It's not even over-the-counter.
[01:42:10.545 --> 01:42:12.106]  It has a little bit of menthol in it.
[01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:12.786]  It's not a drug.
[01:42:13.767 --> 01:42:14.367]  It's a candy.
[01:42:14.448 --> 01:42:16.089]  You're arrested.
[01:42:16.169 --> 01:42:20.732]  Your mother puts a butter knife, a plastic one, in your lunchbox to go on a field trip.
[01:42:20.752 --> 01:42:21.313]  You're arrested.
[01:42:21.693 --> 01:42:24.575]  You draw an image of your father, who's in the Marines, for art class.
[01:42:24.615 --> 01:42:25.275]  He has a gun.
[01:42:25.496 --> 01:42:26.056]  You're arrested.
[01:42:26.156 --> 01:42:27.017]  It's thought crime.
[01:42:27.397 --> 01:42:29.558]  And it's not even a crime, but they still arrest you.
[01:42:30.599 --> 01:42:32.080]  And it's the same thing with TSA.
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:36.783]  We've got to break the 4th Amendment, the 10th Amendment, outside their jurisdiction.
[01:42:37.063 --> 01:42:38.544]  We've got to grab your genitals.
[01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:39.785]  We've got to do this.
[01:42:40.406 --> 01:42:41.206]  Well, no, they don't.
[01:42:41.226 --> 01:42:45.849]  It's the idea that there's prior constraint, that we're all guilty, that they've got to protect us from everything.
[01:42:46.089 --> 01:42:49.031]  And I said, watch, it'll be the highways, it'll be the shopping malls.
[01:42:49.152 --> 01:42:49.672]  Now it is.
[01:42:50.132 --> 01:42:51.293]  That was always their plan.
[01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:51.973]  They said it was.
[01:42:52.374 --> 01:42:55.416]  To expand in mission creep, mission sprint,
[01:42:56.056 --> 01:42:57.717]  Into every facet of the world.
[01:42:57.958 --> 01:43:00.920]  Tell us about this video clip we're about to go to where you interviewed him.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:06.784]  So anyway, we went through security and I got chatting to him and he's a very likable guy.
[01:43:06.804 --> 01:43:12.629]  He's the type of guy that you know you want to sit down and have a chat with because he's just funny and he's got a good perspective on life.
[01:43:13.089 --> 01:43:24.258]  So he allowed me to interview him for 10 minutes or something like that as we're waiting for a flight to El Paso and it's very personable guy and it's just still it's unbelievable.
[01:43:24.258 --> 01:43:46.095]  This is the sort of thing that I've heard about on your show, about grannies in wheelchairs getting tossed out of wheelchairs, and until you see it, and listen, when you start seeing this stuff, as you hear it on the radio, on your show Alex, and then you go, my first trip into the States, my first time through TSA, and I get this, you see this situation, now you know... Now you're a journalist who flies all over the world!
[01:43:47.276 --> 01:43:52.199]  Philippines, you name it, Saudi Arabia, where they have real terrorism, you're not seeing that over there.
[01:43:52.319 --> 01:43:53.120]  No, absolutely not.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:59.244]  Paul Watson, his wife's Chinese, he goes to China a few times a year, and he says it's like heaven.
[01:43:59.264 --> 01:44:01.986]  You just walk right through, great service, everything's wonderful.
[01:44:02.726 --> 01:44:06.148]  And this is a place where if you're a political dissident, they kill you and cut your organs out.
[01:44:06.288 --> 01:44:10.990]  I got shouted at at Heathrow for having a deodorant that was almost finished.
[01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:12.611]  Stupid of me, I left it in my rucksack.
[01:44:12.631 --> 01:44:14.932]  Well, they pick those things to make you feel like a criminal.
[01:44:15.072 --> 01:44:16.573]  Yeah, she's like, how dare you?
[01:44:16.773 --> 01:44:18.034]  Look at the size of your deodorant.
[01:44:18.494 --> 01:44:19.615]  That's the wrong size.
[01:44:19.635 --> 01:44:20.415]  She's shouting at me.
[01:44:20.795 --> 01:44:23.356]  I'm just like, hey, put it in the rubbish tip if you want.
[01:44:23.376 --> 01:44:24.857]  But they tell them to do that.
[01:44:25.297 --> 01:44:30.100]  I was in Billings and the woman had one of those two-ouncers out of the hotel that I knew from the list was okay.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.865]  She's screaming at a family and I had to say something.
[01:44:33.225 --> 01:44:35.049]  Hey, you know that's a proper size.
[01:44:35.069 --> 01:44:36.272]  You just want to yell at somebody.
[01:44:36.893 --> 01:44:37.735]  And they didn't know what to do.
[01:44:37.775 --> 01:44:38.737]  They flipped out.
[01:44:38.757 --> 01:44:40.100]  And I said, yeah, I'm not scared of you.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.342]  That kind of ruins the fun, doesn't it?
[01:44:43.166 --> 01:44:45.689]  Because I'm committed and I will expose you scum.
[01:44:45.929 --> 01:44:48.032]  They're meant to convert America into a police state.
[01:44:48.432 --> 01:44:52.016]  The one time I almost physically got angry was in San Francisco.
[01:44:52.176 --> 01:44:53.718]  And I've told this story many times, I'll tell it briefly.
[01:44:54.119 --> 01:44:57.122]  They were doing checkpoints up at the gate after you'd already gone through.
[01:44:57.623 --> 01:45:02.308]  And there was a group of Pearl Harbor survivors flying out of San Francisco.
[01:45:02.328 --> 01:45:03.309]  I was flying back to Austin.
[01:45:04.210 --> 01:45:04.891]  Same gate area.
[01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:06.512]  They were going to Hawaii.
[01:45:06.973 --> 01:45:08.995]  This is like six, seven years ago, so they're probably all dead now.
[01:45:09.735 --> 01:45:13.199]  And they were there with their younger wives who, you know, were old ladies themselves.
[01:45:13.559 --> 01:45:14.640]  And these guys were in walkers.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.701]  They had oxygen tanks.
[01:45:16.022 --> 01:45:20.466]  The guy they were harassing had his eyelids peeling down, you know, like he was on death's doorstep.
[01:45:20.506 --> 01:45:21.967]  He was fighting to go meet his buddies.
[01:45:22.348 --> 01:45:26.352]  One more time, he had USS Arizona, and that's the one that sunk on his hat.
[01:45:27.506 --> 01:45:31.209]  And there were folks that couldn't speak English in blue outfits.
[01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:32.650]  It was called Wolverine security.
[01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:35.071]  Gibbering and jabbering and poking him.
[01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:35.832]  And the guy couldn't even hear.
[01:45:35.852 --> 01:45:38.073]  He had hearing aids crossed all over his face.
[01:45:38.093 --> 01:45:39.955]  I mean, he looked like he was about to die.
[01:45:40.683 --> 01:45:42.965]  I'm not making fun of an old man, that's what I'm saying, describing him.
[01:45:43.205 --> 01:45:48.508]  And the guy was looking up at him, and then they made him get away from his walker, and he's shaking his wife like I need to help him.
[01:45:48.708 --> 01:45:55.513]  And they're like, about his tank, and the woman's going, well we brought it in, he's gotta have it, they said.
[01:45:55.533 --> 01:46:01.077]  And I mean, and I'm just like, I got this sick feeling, and literally went stumbling over to my chair.
[01:46:01.137 --> 01:46:06.841]  That happens when I can't physically defend somebody, and I make myself like destroy my manhood, I actually become ill.
[01:46:07.671 --> 01:46:11.694]  And I went crawling off, and hearing the gibbering in the background.
[01:46:11.734 --> 01:46:13.035]  I mean, this is what America is!
[01:46:13.835 --> 01:46:24.202]  If someone asked me to do that job, and someone said, can you go over there and test that quadruple amputee for explosives in his limbs, and I find out he's a retired math teacher, this guy is all American.
[01:46:24.222 --> 01:46:25.683]  And they know him, they harass him every time.
[01:46:25.703 --> 01:46:28.345]  Yeah, there's no one more all American than Jeff Lewis, right?
[01:46:28.665 --> 01:46:30.246]  So if someone asked me to do that,
[01:46:31.667 --> 01:46:34.509]  I would not be the guy that says, I'm afraid to lose my job.
[01:46:34.969 --> 01:46:37.990]  I'm not, I'm going to reject my superior's orders.
[01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:41.832]  I am not going to lower my integrity and the integrity of that man.
[01:46:42.172 --> 01:46:44.294]  So until people can stand.
[01:46:44.374 --> 01:46:45.414]  It's like Rosa Parks.
[01:46:45.574 --> 01:46:46.815]  This is the new civil issue.
[01:46:46.835 --> 01:46:47.775]  It's not about race.
[01:46:47.855 --> 01:46:49.276]  It's about the government harassing us.
[01:46:49.476 --> 01:46:50.137]  But that's what it is.
[01:46:50.197 --> 01:46:54.179]  It's a revolution to find idiots that will follow these orders.
[01:46:54.259 --> 01:47:00.542]  How can you look at yourself in the mirror knowing that those are the sort of orders that you're executing for your boss for
[01:47:00.742 --> 01:47:02.143]  Well, I've seen them, especially in Houston.
[01:47:02.163 --> 01:47:02.943]  My grandmother went to a wedding.
[01:47:23.866 --> 01:47:27.570]  And I'd seen this with other old people there that were in wheelchairs and stuff, but she got polio.
[01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:29.932]  Like 60 plus percent of her muscles destroyed.
[01:47:30.273 --> 01:47:34.297]  She's on crutches because she wouldn't be alive if she didn't make herself go on crutches.
[01:47:34.958 --> 01:47:36.839]  I mean, you know, she's in pain all the time.
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:40.043]  Worked for 30, 40 years, you know, in a print shop, you know.
[01:47:40.844 --> 01:47:46.610]  And she went with my parents to a family wedding of my cousin in Mexico.
[01:47:47.674 --> 01:47:47.834]  I don't
[01:48:10.223 --> 01:48:15.027]  I mean, this country is a joke.
[01:48:15.788 --> 01:48:17.429]  It is a flaming joke.
[01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:18.951]  People say, how dare you hate America?
[01:48:19.191 --> 01:48:20.112]  This isn't America.
[01:48:20.392 --> 01:48:22.274]  What this has turned into is a joke.
[01:48:22.814 --> 01:48:28.279]  And my parents said it was incredible to my grandmother, just screaming at her in Houston.
[01:48:31.202 --> 01:48:33.443]  Man, I tell you this country is just and it's gonna get worse.
[01:48:33.503 --> 01:48:59.151]  It's a scientific humiliation of this country We're gonna skip this break as I gotta go this piece and then some calls go ahead Yeah, I talked to my mother about this and always talked to my family to get my take on things like security on airports for instance and my mother said that you know that she has run into at least on one occasion someone who's really really rude and But she you know you can't really sit there not everyone wants to put them in their place because if you have to catch a flight in 30 minutes and
[01:48:59.531 --> 01:49:00.733]  Well you're also scared of them.
[01:49:00.833 --> 01:49:02.255]  Yeah, well you don't want to miss your flight.
[01:49:02.275 --> 01:49:03.877]  A lot of them are on crazed power trips.
[01:49:04.498 --> 01:49:15.253]  So they have the upper hand and it does lend itself to control freakery and sort of mindset of people who like to be in charge and like say stay in line.
[01:49:15.533 --> 01:49:16.935]  Can you move in line, please?
[01:49:16.975 --> 01:49:17.836]  Can you stop, please?
[01:49:17.876 --> 01:49:18.357]  Can you go, please?
[01:49:18.417 --> 01:49:25.726]  Well, I hope dying of cancer for all of them is a condolence because seven times increase in cancer where they've had the scanners in for eight years at Boston.
[01:49:26.046 --> 01:49:31.973]  I hope they enjoy getting chopped up by the loving government hospitals because you're all dead.
[01:49:32.634 --> 01:49:42.140]  Well, the TSA agent at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix assured me that their scanner only penetrates the surface and only the clothing.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:42.920]  No, they've lied to them.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:43.200]  I know.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.881]  They say John Hopkins says it's safe.
[01:49:44.901 --> 01:49:46.502]  The head of John Hopkins says that's a lie.
[01:49:46.882 --> 01:49:47.463]  We didn't say that.
[01:49:47.483 --> 01:49:48.463]  Our report says cancer.
[01:49:48.764 --> 01:49:49.624]  No, they're idiots.
[01:49:50.024 --> 01:49:53.386]  They're people that believe the government says there's no radiation from this honey cake.
[01:49:53.606 --> 01:49:55.768]  Now, stick your hands down that child's pants.
[01:49:56.638 --> 01:49:58.399]  And they're like, OK!
[01:49:58.419 --> 01:49:58.459]  OK!
[01:49:58.779 --> 01:50:01.981]  So everybody needs to say, no, I'm not going to walk through that scanner.
[01:50:02.242 --> 01:50:02.942]  You have a right.
[01:50:03.302 --> 01:50:06.845]  This is not the law to... And by the way, they're doing gropes after the scanners now.
[01:50:07.885 --> 01:50:08.706]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:09.226 --> 01:50:10.327]  Listen, let's go to this piece.
[01:50:10.927 --> 01:50:13.049]  Again, this is Jeff Lewis, quadruple.
[01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.629]  I said triple.
[01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:14.810]  He's missing all four limbs.
[01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:19.573]  And here he is being interviewed by our own Patrick Henningsen for Infowars.com.
[01:50:19.853 --> 01:50:20.733]  Here is that report.
[01:50:21.194 --> 01:50:23.895]  Jeff Lewis, quadruple amputee.
[01:50:24.136 --> 01:50:26.137]  You got me coming and going.
[01:50:27.039 --> 01:50:43.845]  When I get to the airport, I travel enough that most everybody here knows me on almost a first-name basis, but I still have to go through the entire routine, head-to-toe body check, fondling, swabbing, and re-apologizing, and make sure I get here at least 25 minutes earlier so they have time to do all that.
[01:50:43.885 --> 01:50:45.645]  Sometimes it's not thorough enough.
[01:50:45.665 --> 01:50:50.687]  Call me back to do some more x-raying on top of that, even though they know exactly who I am.
[01:50:54.288 --> 01:50:55.590]  I don't think so.
[01:51:04.116 --> 01:51:07.698]  I don't know how to put it.
[01:51:07.738 --> 01:51:08.799]  A domestic terrorist?
[01:51:08.899 --> 01:51:10.540]  Yeah, until they find one.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.242]  It's a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
[01:51:13.262 --> 01:51:17.525]  Why check all the grandmothers so thoroughly?
[01:51:17.605 --> 01:51:18.846]  I just don't understand it.
[01:51:18.926 --> 01:51:23.449]  I mean, I can put us through a machine and see if we've got a bomb on us.
[01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:25.030]  I can understand that.
[01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:28.392]  If the bell doesn't ring, why be so invasive?
[01:51:29.735 --> 01:51:36.018]  I'll be honest, the people that check me over are very, most of them, 99% are very, very apologetic.
[01:51:36.038 --> 01:51:40.781]  They know that they don't have to check me, but if they don't do it, someone else... Hit pause right there.
[01:51:40.861 --> 01:51:41.982]  I understand that.
[01:51:42.322 --> 01:51:42.782]  Hit pause.
[01:51:43.102 --> 01:51:47.665]  It's worse that they know he flies all the time as a motivational speaker.
[01:51:47.725 --> 01:51:56.610]  It's worse that it's arbitrary and we know you're not a suspect and there's no pretense that you're bad, but we're going to do this to you.
[01:51:56.690 --> 01:51:58.811]  It's the idea that there's no due process anymore.
[01:51:59.534 --> 01:52:07.701]  And talking about Anglo, Saxon, Protestant, whatever, if you go back to Magna Carta and basic common law that comes out of that, that's why you're innocent until proven guilty.
[01:52:08.102 --> 01:52:12.506]  Because then it's an endless, I'm going to come in your house without a warrant because I feel like it.
[01:52:12.546 --> 01:52:13.507]  By the way, that's starting.
[01:52:14.047 --> 01:52:17.530]  That's what this is about, is overthrowing due process.
[01:52:17.610 --> 01:52:19.252]  And it's all of your basic rights.
[01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:22.835]  Police, military are all being taught to hate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:52:23.095 --> 01:52:24.437]  That's a protection for you.
[01:52:25.037 --> 01:52:29.342]  You notice as it's being thrown out the window, all the other liberties are going, and the prosperity's going.
[01:52:30.002 --> 01:52:44.959]  Let's go back to more of this interview with him there in the airport quadruple, amputee, flying out of Arizona, grabbed and I guess they make him take parts off and... Yeah, yeah, yeah, scan for explosives every time, here it is.
[01:52:46.431 --> 01:52:56.314]  And I'm not going to be the protester that stages a sit-in, because I want to get from point A to point B, so I'll go through it.
[01:52:56.354 --> 01:52:59.135]  There's no common sense in any of it.
[01:52:59.235 --> 01:53:01.955]  It's a systematic problem, I think.
[01:53:02.035 --> 01:53:03.616]  I'm doing this because I was told.
[01:53:13.167 --> 01:53:14.629]  Don't blame me.
[01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:16.132]  Blame the guy higher up.
[01:53:16.172 --> 01:53:16.592]  Yeah.
[01:53:16.632 --> 01:53:17.634]  He's making me do this.
[01:53:17.694 --> 01:53:20.497]  Think of all the personal information you have to give.
[01:53:20.538 --> 01:53:22.400]  Just in buying the ticket.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:23.662]  We bought our ticket online.
[01:53:23.742 --> 01:53:27.146]  And you have to give a lot of personal information.
[01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.268]  Why can't that be?
[01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:31.429]  Have a database check right then and there.
[01:53:31.469 --> 01:53:32.870]  Yeah, profile it.
[01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:33.190]  Yeah.
[01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:39.911]  And then when you come to the airport, they know exactly who they need to worry about and who they don't need to worry about.
[01:53:39.951 --> 01:53:49.954]  But if you look at my entire history, I think the most violent thing I did was pop a kid in the snoot in the 4-3 because he was paying too much attention to my grip.
[01:53:49.974 --> 01:53:51.434]  They haven't caught anybody.
[01:53:51.474 --> 01:53:54.595]  They have not pulled anybody through the screening process.
[01:53:54.715 --> 01:53:55.495]  In all these years?
[01:53:55.615 --> 01:53:55.995]  Not one.
[01:53:57.296 --> 01:54:01.821]  Concentrate on the people that are going to be doing something horrible.
[01:54:01.861 --> 01:54:02.782]  Be more efficient?
[01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:03.162]  Yeah.
[01:54:03.423 --> 01:54:04.243]  Alright.
[01:54:04.324 --> 01:54:08.488]  A background check before you ever come to the airport can be done very easily.
[01:54:08.548 --> 01:54:11.632]  You can program the computer and say, hey, this guy needs to be checked out.
[01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:14.610]  So there it is.
[01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:17.711]  We're going to get that posted up at Infowars.com.
[01:54:18.072 --> 01:54:20.193]  But see, he's still saying, wow, this doesn't work.
[01:54:20.233 --> 01:54:21.453]  It's not stopping terrorists.
[01:54:21.814 --> 01:54:22.754]  Man, this is silly.
[01:54:22.794 --> 01:54:23.314]  It's stupid.
[01:54:23.394 --> 01:54:23.895]  No, it's not.
[01:54:24.335 --> 01:54:26.276]  It's a power grab.
[01:54:26.696 --> 01:54:27.997]  Power grab.
[01:54:28.437 --> 01:54:31.379]  That's what all this is about, is taking over society.
[01:54:31.659 --> 01:54:33.640]  I want to take a few calls, but any other comments on this?
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.261]  Yeah, the power grab is a voluntary power grab.
[01:54:36.501 --> 01:54:44.966]  The big art of deception here, the mental trick, if you like, the sleight of hand, is to get people to parrot the saying that it's the law, it's the law.
[01:54:45.166 --> 01:54:51.089]  This is what the security guards, as they apologize to me... No, it's against the law to grab somebody's genitals without a warrant!
[01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:52.050]  It is not the law.
[01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:54.572]  It's what's called security protocol.
[01:54:54.852 --> 01:55:02.698]  And what now, the real law, due process, what you were talking about before, which is innocent until proven guilty, this has been usurped by protocol.
[01:55:03.018 --> 01:55:04.199]  Security protocol.
[01:55:04.239 --> 01:55:05.440]  Regulations.
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:06.380]  Policy.
[01:55:06.901 --> 01:55:15.007]  In fact, when I had a guy trying to grope my genitals flying back from Las Vegas when I was doing a video shoot investigation, he said, I have administrative rights to search you.
[01:55:15.107 --> 01:55:16.628]  He has a right to grab my genitals.
[01:55:16.988 --> 01:55:17.909]  Administrative rights.
[01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:20.211]  There's a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
[01:55:20.931 --> 01:55:23.834]  And notice they beta tested it in a control area like an airport.
[01:55:23.874 --> 01:55:24.915]  Now it's spanning out.
[01:55:25.175 --> 01:55:26.416]  Oh, it's a privilege to own a gun.
[01:55:26.456 --> 01:55:27.677]  It's a privilege to drive it on the road.
[01:55:28.078 --> 01:55:30.760]  And I'll tell you something else, Alex, and let me just leave you with this.
[01:55:32.081 --> 01:55:33.523]  I went through security at Heathrow.
[01:55:33.683 --> 01:55:34.804]  They ripped everything apart.
[01:55:35.204 --> 01:55:38.087]  I'm talking to a guy that recognized me from RT in the queue.
[01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:39.867]  Um, on the airplane.
[01:55:40.208 --> 01:55:41.428]  And we start talking about this stuff.
[01:55:41.468 --> 01:55:45.249]  He's all, I love what you're doing, uh, love what Alex is doing, love what RT is doing.
[01:55:45.269 --> 01:55:48.510]  He's all, he's all, he, he, this guy collects guns, right?
[01:55:48.730 --> 01:55:49.831]  I won't say his name on air.
[01:55:50.151 --> 01:55:52.712]  He collects vintage cars and vintage guns.
[01:55:53.012 --> 01:55:53.432]  He's English.
[01:55:53.492 --> 01:56:05.396]  He goes to America, gets a Tommy gun from the Al Capone era, with a circular magazine, his old machine guns, puts two of them in his bag, Alex, checks it on to British Airways, and picks it up when the baggage, when he gets back to London.
[01:56:05.856 --> 01:56:08.580]  Those are two machine guns through security.
[01:56:09.457 --> 01:56:13.179]  Yeah, checked onto a regular plane, not found.
[01:56:13.519 --> 01:56:16.621]  They can't even get people that are openly... No, it's all fake.
[01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:25.126]  And then when a video comes out showing the scanners don't find bombs, they try to block the video and call reporters and say, don't interview this engineer.
[01:56:25.227 --> 01:56:29.289]  It's all a federal power grab to grope you and your family to training your slaves.
[01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:33.952]  And in the process, they've dumbed down all these security workers to such a low level of confidence.
[01:56:33.992 --> 01:56:36.133]  Well, they're in there rotissering in the radiation.
[01:56:36.894 --> 01:56:37.894]  They've dumbed them right down.
[01:56:39.568 --> 01:56:42.530]  You know, they don't know their whatever from their elbow.
[01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:44.031]  They don't know what they're looking for.
[01:56:44.071 --> 01:56:45.412]  They don't know who they're looking for.
[01:56:45.432 --> 01:56:48.213]  Well, they're looking for their crotch.
[01:56:48.514 --> 01:56:55.438]  This is like, you know, when you see those old movies, the old spy movies with the Soviet Union, they used to have people impersonating German officers, for instance.
[01:56:55.798 --> 01:57:06.925]  Because the police state in Germany and the Soviet Union, Stalin era, was so massive, you could throw a uniform on, put a badge on, and say you're from the Department of Agricultural Safety, and they wouldn't know the difference.
[01:57:07.105 --> 01:57:10.327]  They wouldn't know the difference between that or a real department.
[01:57:10.608 --> 01:57:21.515]  So the state has grown to such a fantastic cancerous degree in America that pretty soon it's going to be such a running joke you could say you could impersonate a federal officer.
[01:57:22.116 --> 01:57:27.540]  Well what's happening is all these agencies are now getting weapons and are power grabbing and everybody's bowing down.
[01:57:29.779 --> 01:57:38.468]  The NOAA weather system has now expanded to all our coastlines, and in areas that are legal and lawful to surf, they're just arresting people saying it harasses whales.
[01:57:38.988 --> 01:57:47.257]  And then when there's a local lifeguard there that has a jet ski for emergencies, under the city rules, to save people, the feds arrest them with felonies.
[01:57:47.737 --> 01:57:49.038]  And it's just, and fishermen.
[01:57:49.798 --> 01:57:51.259]  I used to go fishing on the Texas coast.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.561]  Even bay fishing, they're scared to death.
[01:57:53.601 --> 01:58:00.145]  And there's feds and locals harassing you, and they could pull you over with little kids and scream at you and board the boat and yell at you.
[01:58:00.185 --> 01:58:06.009]  And now they stop their boats when they see Homeland Security or Coast Guard or anybody else and shake in fear.
[01:58:06.029 --> 01:58:11.573]  And they say, if you don't stop your boat, even if they're 500 yards away, they see it as disrespect and board you.
[01:58:12.733 --> 01:58:16.435]  And I watched the Feds and others drive by, they used to be like this, their eyes are all crazed.
[01:58:16.875 --> 01:58:20.317]  I mean, look, you get a uniform, you're Bosch, you're God, Soviet Union.
[01:58:20.897 --> 01:58:22.718]  I mean, Nazi Germany, it's here!
[01:58:23.398 --> 01:58:25.859]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves, what's it going to be ruled by?
[01:58:26.179 --> 01:58:28.400]  What is land of the coward, home of the slaves going to be ruled by, Patrick?
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:35.243]  It's going to be ruled by an Indian guy with a badge or a woman with a badge who's... that's the only job going out there.
[01:58:35.283 --> 01:58:37.144]  Who wants to put their hands on your crotch?
[01:58:37.864 --> 01:58:38.465]  They enjoy it!
[01:58:38.485 --> 01:58:39.245]  We'll be right back.

[02:00:17.648 --> 02:00:21.733]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.405 --> 02:00:35.687]  All right, we've got Sean Stone joining us coming up here after this quick break.
[02:00:36.168 --> 02:00:37.569]  We've only got a little five-minute segment here.
[02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:39.209]  I want to take a few calls with Patrick Henningsen.
[02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:43.792]  We'll try to take calls as well when Sean Stone is on with us.
[02:00:43.852 --> 02:00:47.894]  Recently back from Iran, TV host, filmmaker Sean Stone coming up.
[02:00:47.974 --> 02:00:49.575]  Perry in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:00:49.595 --> 02:00:51.757]  You're on the air with Patrick Henningsen.
[02:00:51.797 --> 02:00:52.117]  Go ahead.
[02:00:53.268 --> 02:00:54.649]  Alex, this is actually for you.
[02:00:54.909 --> 02:01:09.254]  Alex, we need a non-violent million man or million patriot march with rifles to DC to make a citizen's arrest to whoever have committed crimes against our Constitution and against us.
[02:01:09.314 --> 02:01:13.776]  We need to arrest Congress, FDA, Montana, Merck, the EPA.
[02:01:14.528 --> 02:01:15.288]  And the rest of them.
[02:01:15.369 --> 02:01:16.969]  And we need to take our country back right now.
[02:01:17.029 --> 02:01:19.091]  Well, I hear that and I've seen that for years.
[02:01:19.251 --> 02:01:21.892]  And the problem is, that would be called an insurrection.
[02:01:21.932 --> 02:01:29.116]  The public doesn't know that foreign banks have taken over Washington, so they would say that it was an insurrection, would use the military against us.
[02:01:30.577 --> 02:01:33.279]  I would rather, but I understand that gut instinct to do that.
[02:01:34.412 --> 02:01:43.980]  I would rather educate the states to the level, have grand juries start indicting people, have the Congress indict Obama for launching the Libya war without congressional authorization, and it's now been introduced.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.242]  I mean, it's a high-crime misdemeanor.
[02:01:46.062 --> 02:01:47.303]  And it's like, no, don't do it.
[02:01:47.403 --> 02:01:48.885]  If he does it again, do it now.
[02:01:49.525 --> 02:01:50.706]  There's ways to do this.
[02:01:50.786 --> 02:01:52.728]  He who shoots first loses.
[02:01:52.808 --> 02:01:54.410]  And I know what happened at Lexington and Concord.
[02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:57.873]  The feds of that day, the redcoats, came to confiscate the guns.
[02:01:58.971 --> 02:02:00.132]  And the people said, no, you're not.
[02:02:00.232 --> 02:02:01.532]  Nobody knows who shot first.
[02:02:02.212 --> 02:02:03.333]  The shot heard around the world.
[02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:05.834]  If people are looking for a war, it's probably going to start.
[02:02:06.914 --> 02:02:07.675]  I don't want one, too.
[02:02:08.155 --> 02:02:08.435]  OK?
[02:02:08.755 --> 02:02:09.976]  I'd rather fix this peacefully.
[02:02:09.996 --> 02:02:10.836]  And we're very close.
[02:02:11.236 --> 02:02:13.957]  Every day we keep it from a shooting war, the police and military are waking up.
[02:02:14.337 --> 02:02:15.098]  But God bless you.
[02:02:15.138 --> 02:02:17.859]  Let's get Patrick Henningsen's take on that big question you just raised.
[02:02:19.449 --> 02:02:33.156]  Look, the thing about the United States is this country's got a great history of people being able to make decisions for themselves, be responsible for themselves, take care of their own families, states being able to take care of their own rights.
[02:02:33.396 --> 02:02:38.178]  The big battleground in this country is the battle between states and the federal government.
[02:02:38.519 --> 02:02:45.482]  That, to me, is where the real... Two states have now passed laws nullifying NDAA and saying arrest the feds if they try to put a bag over citizens' heads.
[02:02:45.822 --> 02:02:49.964]  And I think my instinct is that is really what's under the surface in Arizona.
[02:02:49.984 --> 02:02:51.704]  Yeah, let the evil keep playing out.
[02:02:51.744 --> 02:02:52.644]  It's waking everybody up.
[02:02:52.885 --> 02:02:58.547]  Sheriff Joe's thing in Arizona is really behind the Obama birth certificate is the federal issue.
[02:02:58.607 --> 02:03:09.170]  The federal agency's coming in and dictating how you're going to do border control, dictating how you're going to deal with your own immigration problems, versus the state being able to handle their own affairs.
[02:03:09.190 --> 02:03:09.891]  That's right.
[02:03:09.911 --> 02:03:11.351]  You've got to defend yourself.
[02:03:11.891 --> 02:03:13.032]  Defense is always good.
[02:03:13.712 --> 02:03:18.041]  Hate to copy a Star Wars thing, but you know, knowledge and defense never for attack.
[02:03:18.983 --> 02:03:22.089]  And because the position of power is from defense, true defense.
[02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:24.454]  That's why they call it Defense Department, it's really War Department.
[02:03:25.177 --> 02:03:35.727]  But that's the bottom line, is that we've got to be in that position to defend the innocents, to have courage, but the globalists are destroying themselves.
[02:03:36.167 --> 02:03:44.335]  You know, you have to defend yourself from a position of righteousness, and you always have to have a moral backbone, or you have to have a moral basis to do this.
[02:03:44.555 --> 02:03:45.836]  We have this in the United States.
[02:03:46.156 --> 02:03:47.878]  You have to defer to the U.S.
[02:03:47.958 --> 02:03:48.639]  Constitution.
[02:03:49.039 --> 02:03:49.760]  And Bill of Rights.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:50.501]  It's there.
[02:03:50.561 --> 02:03:52.002]  Our Founding Fathers gave it to us.
[02:03:52.283 --> 02:03:53.504]  Fantastic document.
[02:03:53.904 --> 02:03:54.365]  Genius.
[02:03:54.545 --> 02:03:54.845]  Okay?
[02:03:55.206 --> 02:03:57.889]  That is your moral backstop in this country.
[02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.890]  Do not be afraid.
[02:03:58.910 --> 02:04:04.616]  Yeah, those that attack first and then attack innocence, no amount of propaganda or technology is going to prop them up.
[02:04:04.856 --> 02:04:06.078]  This evil will fall.
[02:04:06.518 --> 02:04:09.882]  We need to be there putting out the opposite, the truth, so people have an alternative.
[02:04:10.642 --> 02:04:14.605]  You know, Alex, before I came doing this journalistic work, I worked in the corporate world, okay?
[02:04:14.905 --> 02:04:20.208]  I was scared to death when I put my first stories up online, you can imagine, or when your first time you're on TV.
[02:04:20.648 --> 02:04:22.629]  Scared that, oh my god, what's going to happen to me now?
[02:04:22.689 --> 02:04:24.851]  I just said something really outrageous.
[02:04:24.891 --> 02:04:30.934]  But, you know, people got to realize everybody out there has got a certain amount of power to influence their families, their friends, and so forth.
[02:04:30.994 --> 02:04:31.374]  That's right.
[02:04:31.454 --> 02:04:32.415]  You can't be afraid to voice
[02:04:32.415 --> 02:04:34.676]  Well, you're going to make enemies, but you're also going to make friends.
[02:04:34.696 --> 02:04:35.536]  It's empowering.
[02:04:35.656 --> 02:04:42.138]  You've got to say who you are, wear your colors, so you can join with those who are like-minded.
[02:04:42.478 --> 02:04:43.919]  And so the enemy knows your flag.
[02:04:44.219 --> 02:04:44.659]  God bless you.
[02:04:44.679 --> 02:04:47.060]  I'm going to get you back in for an hour this week to talk about all that.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.482]  Patrick Henningsen writes for InfoWars.com and just shot this great video report we're going to be posting in the next hour or two.
[02:04:52.802 --> 02:04:54.602]  Darren McBrain's going to add some documents to it.
[02:04:54.823 --> 02:04:55.483]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:55.503 --> 02:04:56.063]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:56.303 --> 02:04:56.683]  Amazing.
[02:04:56.963 --> 02:04:58.684]  Alright, Sean Stone, straight ahead.
[02:05:01.187 --> 02:05:02.207]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:02.267 --> 02:05:04.408]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:05:04.608 --> 02:05:07.309]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:12.211]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:18.954]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:19.434 --> 02:05:29.878]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:30.638 --> 02:05:34.780]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:41.142]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:41.382 --> 02:05:42.522]  Now that's results.
[02:05:42.943 --> 02:05:49.365]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:05:49.725 --> 02:05:54.987]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:05:58.008 --> 02:05:59.609]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[02:06:01.032 --> 02:06:06.455]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:07.675 --> 02:06:12.438]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.818 --> 02:06:19.602]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.543 --> 02:06:23.984]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:25.625 --> 02:06:27.886]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:39.699 --> 02:06:41.580]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.362]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:43.642 --> 02:06:46.204]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.524 --> 02:06:50.587]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:06:50.767 --> 02:06:52.788]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:06:53.148 --> 02:06:55.370]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:57.271]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:57.431 --> 02:06:57.872]  Got it.
[02:06:58.212 --> 02:06:59.093]  Others don't.
[02:07:01.311 --> 02:07:02.832]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.032 --> 02:07:08.074]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.334 --> 02:07:09.694]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:09.874 --> 02:07:18.658]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.398 --> 02:07:26.500]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:34.543]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:34.943 --> 02:07:42.325]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:07:45.086 --> 02:07:46.507]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:46.707 --> 02:07:48.467]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.636 --> 02:08:28.032]  Well, I hadn't seen the new Wall Street film yet.
[02:08:28.072 --> 02:08:29.177]  It's been, I don't know, a year or two.
[02:08:30.714 --> 02:08:35.355]  And I watched a big part of it yesterday and then the rest of it today while I was on the treadmill jogging.
[02:08:35.615 --> 02:08:38.876]  And an excellent film produced by Oliver Stone.
[02:08:38.896 --> 02:08:42.717]  And I did notice a little cameo in there with the one and the only Sean Stone.
[02:08:43.157 --> 02:08:45.458]  But I do want to bring up that film a little bit.
[02:08:45.498 --> 02:08:48.479]  You know, I've had him on the show before and never raised stuff about his dad.
[02:08:48.539 --> 02:08:54.301]  But I just wanted to get his take on that film and ask what his favorite film of all time is.
[02:08:54.741 --> 02:08:57.341]  But he's here to talk about very, very serious issues.
[02:08:57.381 --> 02:08:58.622]  He's Sean Stone.
[02:08:59.823 --> 02:09:05.482]  And he is a documentary filmmaker, TV producer, TV host of, uh, well...
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:18.110]  Prolific work and he is one of the big reporters on the third season of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura and Tyrell Ventura Coming out very very soon.
[02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:32.763]  I talked to Tyrell last week, and they're not quite sure on the date yet But we should have that for you soon, but I wanted to get him on you know I for whatever reason I didn't get him on when he first made his big announcement a few weeks ago, and he's been on O'Reilly CNN basically everything
[02:09:33.638 --> 02:09:35.139]  But now in the aftermath, we'll get him on.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.524]  He went and converted to, I guess, Shiite Islam in Iran.
[02:09:40.964 --> 02:09:45.908]  And when I was out in Las Vegas, we were looking at some rocket bases and other things out there for an investigation we were doing.
[02:09:46.208 --> 02:09:48.690]  He showed me his sword of, you know, Ali around his neck.
[02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:50.612]  And he said, you know, I'm thinking about converting.
[02:09:51.132 --> 02:09:53.634]  And we really didn't talk much about it, but he said, no, I'm serious.
[02:09:54.615 --> 02:09:58.238]  But the way he's described it is, and that's what the Bible says, it all comes out of Abraham.
[02:09:58.859 --> 02:10:05.704]  Judaism, and then of course Christianity, and then Islam, and most major sects of Islam understand that and know that.
[02:10:05.744 --> 02:10:18.013]  So I think for his statement, maybe I'm putting words in his mouth, but what I've gotten from what he said is that he's basically just pointing out that it's, at least in its roots, all goes back to the same God and let's stop killing each other.
[02:10:18.113 --> 02:10:20.275]  Like Rodney King, can't we all just get along?
[02:10:20.535 --> 02:10:21.496]  Maybe I'm wrong?
[02:10:21.536 --> 02:10:23.378]  Am I putting words in Sean Stone's mouth?
[02:10:23.638 --> 02:10:26.661]  We can find out right now because he joins us.
[02:10:26.721 --> 02:10:27.822]  Sean, great to have you on.
[02:10:27.842 --> 02:10:29.143]  Hey Alex, thank you.
[02:10:29.524 --> 02:10:31.486]  It's good to be back and to talk to you again.
[02:10:32.106 --> 02:10:34.929]  Well, I just, you know, said a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:10:34.949 --> 02:10:39.654]  What's your take on what I said and why did you go to Iran and convert to Shia Islam?
[02:10:40.612 --> 02:10:42.313]  Well, I didn't go to Iran just to convert.
[02:10:42.914 --> 02:10:45.956]  And nor have I... I would never say that I converted.
[02:10:45.996 --> 02:10:47.817]  I've always said that I accepted Islam.
[02:10:47.997 --> 02:10:49.839]  And as you said, I believe... Oh, accepted it!
[02:10:49.919 --> 02:10:50.379]  Sure, sure.
[02:10:50.399 --> 02:10:50.859]  Exactly.
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:51.280]  Islam.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:55.843]  Because all it means to accept Islam is to accept that Muhammad is a prophet of God.
[02:10:55.863 --> 02:10:59.546]  The same lineage going back to Abraham, Moses, and Christ.
[02:11:00.106 --> 02:11:04.047]  So, you know, Islam itself is, you know, very similar to Judaism.
[02:11:04.107 --> 02:11:06.408]  The Sharia law is based on Mosaic law.
[02:11:07.228 --> 02:11:09.268]  Their respect for Christ is tremendous.
[02:11:09.308 --> 02:11:14.309]  They believe that there will be a Last Judgment and Christ will return to Earth as part of the Second Coming.
[02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:17.970]  And they believe, you know, that they are part of this process.
[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:23.952]  So, it's not that... I don't, you know... In truth, the spirit of Islam is not contradictory at all.
[02:11:24.212 --> 02:11:26.032]  And they are very respectful of the people of the Book.
[02:11:26.372 --> 02:11:28.573]  I think that ultimately in spirit, all of us
[02:11:29.293 --> 02:11:36.218]  You know, all the people in the book are opposed to paganism, to the idea of God creation or cults, atheism and satanism.
[02:11:36.338 --> 02:11:38.519]  I think those are actually the real enemies of the religions.
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:58.553]  And anyone who says otherwise, for example, within the religions there are satanists, you know, within the Catholic Church there are satanists, within Islam there are satanists who worship the ego, who incite people to violence against other worshippers of God, who don't understand the ultimate message, which is that we need to devote ourselves to one God, as opposed to these...
[02:11:59.734 --> 02:12:00.314]  We're good to go.
[02:12:21.051 --> 02:12:22.072]  Um, to that God.
[02:12:22.092 --> 02:12:24.754]  So, the Federal Reserve, for example, is a temple.
[02:12:25.074 --> 02:12:26.135]  That's why the Federal Reserve...
[02:12:50.891 --> 02:12:52.354]  Or being out in the open.
[02:12:52.394 --> 02:12:52.754]  You're right.
[02:12:52.794 --> 02:12:56.740]  The Satanists and the Luciferians, they're all deceivers.
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:00.146]  They're all about operating in secret and using deception.
[02:13:00.186 --> 02:13:00.807]  Very well said.
[02:13:01.368 --> 02:13:02.409]  In fact, please elaborate.
[02:13:02.449 --> 02:13:05.794]  Let's get into your research on the Illuminati that you were trying to get into.
[02:13:07.630 --> 02:13:16.332]  Well, just simply to put that this is old, this goes back to ancient Babylon when you're basically, you know, the whole concept of the pound of flesh that's owed in debt, right?
[02:13:16.572 --> 02:13:23.634]  The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare, Shakespeare points this out, that you either owe me the money, or if you don't pay the money, you owe me a pound of flesh.
[02:13:24.234 --> 02:13:27.655]  And that's essentially what these temples are designed to do.
[02:13:27.675 --> 02:13:31.296]  That's why the temples would always put the image of God on the coin, the currency.
[02:13:31.996 --> 02:13:46.446]  So the idea is that you're basically creating a fake God you can't and that's why Islam talks about the fact that you can't The reason you can't put Muhammad's face or any or God's face on coin is because they don't want you to worship an image of God there should you know it goes back to miles
[02:13:47.026 --> 02:13:47.887]  Smashing the idols.
[02:13:48.247 --> 02:13:52.009]  So what we've created though in the West is a very satanic culture of idol worship.
[02:13:52.269 --> 02:13:54.490]  Because it's about your energy and your money going to these people.
[02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:59.773]  You create an idol out of Madonna and Britney Spears and Michael Jackson, whoever it may be.
[02:14:00.054 --> 02:14:01.574]  These cults of worship.
[02:14:01.614 --> 02:14:03.616]  And that's the old Dionysian cult, right?
[02:14:03.636 --> 02:14:07.338]  Where you go and you basically have orgies around these rock concerts or in these clubs.
[02:14:08.178 --> 02:14:08.478]  I don't know.
[02:14:27.629 --> 02:14:28.931]  We're good to go.
[02:14:42.486 --> 02:14:42.686]  I'm good.
[02:15:03.257 --> 02:15:04.498]  And they are truly false gods!
[02:15:27.515 --> 02:15:30.677]  Okay, his Skype just cut out.
[02:15:30.817 --> 02:15:32.698]  Let's reconnect with him right now.
[02:15:32.758 --> 02:15:33.138]  Thank you.
[02:15:33.918 --> 02:15:35.559]  Skype is an incredible thing.
[02:15:35.639 --> 02:15:40.822]  Better audio, video, for another dimension of information here.
[02:15:41.422 --> 02:15:43.483]  But it still is not perfect.
[02:15:44.977 --> 02:15:46.618]  That's why we couldn't use it three or four years ago.
[02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:47.879]  It was way too sketchy then.
[02:15:47.979 --> 02:15:49.320]  Now it's getting really, really good.
[02:15:50.081 --> 02:15:53.243]  But I was going to get into false gods with him.
[02:15:53.643 --> 02:15:55.684]  And see, people think false gods, that's the stuff in the Bible.
[02:15:55.785 --> 02:15:56.745]  It's mind control.
[02:15:57.466 --> 02:16:03.830]  They learned how to manipulate people through images.
[02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:08.754]  And then people can attach a message to their false god, Madonna, Angelina Jolie,
[02:16:09.514 --> 02:16:15.918]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, whatever it is, and then people will basically go along with that because of the image of the idol.
[02:16:16.318 --> 02:16:21.201]  But really it's just a narcissistic star who is just reading off a script or a teleprompter.
[02:16:21.461 --> 02:16:25.103]  That's why I point out my radio show, my TV show, teleprompter free.
[02:16:26.294 --> 02:16:27.055]  Tell a prompter free.
[02:16:27.095 --> 02:16:33.303]  I mean, sometimes I have a TV screen where I can see the video of who I'm interviewing, or when they bring up a new article, I can know that, okay, we're covering that article.
[02:16:33.783 --> 02:16:37.688]  But you know what my words are versus when I say, let's read from this article.
[02:16:38.168 --> 02:16:42.333]  Because what you're hearing is what I've researched, what I stand for, what I believe in.
[02:16:43.655 --> 02:16:44.576]  You're absolutely right.
[02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:48.037]  And Sean, people say, well, this is old mumbo-jumbo.
[02:16:48.358 --> 02:16:49.738]  We're the 21st century.
[02:16:49.758 --> 02:16:51.779]  Atheists say, I don't want to hear about God, I don't believe in it.
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.062]  The point is, the elites do, and they're using it as a science of control.
[02:16:56.442 --> 02:17:03.326]  Maybe it is just an archetypal, you know, you could say to the atheists, I don't agree with this, system of primitive programming of the brain.
[02:17:03.786 --> 02:17:05.507]  The point is, it works.
[02:17:06.287 --> 02:17:06.847]  It works.
[02:17:07.067 --> 02:17:07.668]  It's real.
[02:17:08.168 --> 02:17:12.269]  It's a thousand heroes, a thousand devils, a thousand good guys, a thousand bad guys.
[02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:14.130]  It's the hero of a thousand faces.
[02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:17.311]  It is Jungian psychology, whatever you want to call it.
[02:17:18.511 --> 02:17:20.192]  The elites are obsessed with it.
[02:17:21.052 --> 02:17:22.212]  You know more of the elite than I do.
[02:17:22.533 --> 02:17:23.513]  They're really into the occult.
[02:17:23.533 --> 02:17:27.614]  I know you can't get all the way into it, but have you ever run into the Illuminati, Sean?
[02:17:31.867 --> 02:17:35.991]  I'm very close to some people who have and who are involved in some level.
[02:17:38.093 --> 02:17:40.736]  This is a long exploration, frankly.
[02:17:40.756 --> 02:17:42.438]  It's going to take some time to elaborate.
[02:17:42.478 --> 02:17:45.320]  Basically, the Eyes Wide Shut sex parties are real.
[02:17:45.781 --> 02:17:46.682]  These things take place.
[02:17:46.722 --> 02:17:49.064]  They do have these crystal skull type of things.
[02:17:49.224 --> 02:17:52.027]  Like in the Indiana Jones film, they had the crystal skull.
[02:17:52.287 --> 02:17:53.869]  They have these type of skulls they set up.
[02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:56.851]  At the parties and they feed the energy into those skulls.
[02:17:58.112 --> 02:18:02.776]  There's a tremendous amount of stuff I'm actually working on in Iran, studying what's called the Jinn.
[02:18:03.397 --> 02:18:07.840]  Because that's, in Islam they call them the Jinn, and in the West we call them genies, right?
[02:18:08.521 --> 02:18:14.986]  The point is in the Quran, they say the Jinn were created by God in the beginning, when he created angels, humans, and Jinn.
[02:18:15.967 --> 02:18:22.873]  And in the old days, they said the Jinn and the humans and angels were more interactive before the last fall, before the last flood, Noah's flood.
[02:18:23.813 --> 02:18:26.975]  Well, that's like the Nephilim in the Old Testament in Genesis and Ezekiel.
[02:18:43.223 --> 02:18:45.944]  Because the jinn were involved in constructing Solomon's temple.
[02:18:46.384 --> 02:18:47.764]  King Solomon was able to command them.
[02:18:48.044 --> 02:18:56.747]  He had a ring of power, which is a five-sided pentagram, which is why the pentagram symbol is key for most satanic or black magic ceremonies.
[02:18:57.707 --> 02:19:07.170]  You can then conjure jinn, but Solomon used them for wisdom and to command them and basically use them to build the temple and to honor God, as opposed to what many of the Illuminati do.
[02:19:07.210 --> 02:19:10.234]  We're giving out the big Mason secrets that higher level Masons are taught.
[02:19:10.274 --> 02:19:14.259]  Whether it's real or not, this is what 33rd degree Masons, 32 degree Masons are taught.
[02:19:14.989 --> 02:19:42.218]  Yeah, and it's known outside of the Masonic circles, but the point is that the idea of the Illuminati, and this is known in the East as well, in Iran, in China, people I've talked to from the mystical sects, from the Sufis and other mystical sects, know about these things, that you can make, that first of all there's six dimensions of perception, which is why the star of David, which is actually not David's star, it precedes it, it goes back to Babylon, it's very important because it shows six sides.
[02:19:42.398 --> 02:19:43.458]  It's the key seal.
[02:19:43.678 --> 02:19:47.740]  In fact, it's the seal on the ring to command the creatures.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:49.760]  Whether it's real or not, stay there.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:52.942]  We're going to come back and talk with you on the other side.
[02:19:53.242 --> 02:19:54.142]  Solomon's Key, right?
[02:19:54.162 --> 02:20:00.084]  We're going to come back and discuss all this and your recognition of Islam.
[02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:06.095]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?

[02:23:49.339 --> 02:23:50.599]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:23:50.719 --> 02:23:52.360]  Alright, Sean Stone, director, TV host.
[02:24:08.638 --> 02:24:14.501]  Yes, so what I meant to say was that with the Star of David, the six-sided as opposed to Solomon's, which is
[02:24:37.631 --> 02:24:37.791]  Five.
[02:24:38.111 --> 02:24:39.272]  Well, they're different.
[02:24:39.312 --> 02:24:40.892]  Five-sided stars are used for commanding jinn.
[02:24:41.633 --> 02:24:51.836]  And so, when you go to the East, in Iran, for example, I've been talking to jinn masters, and they describe how what happens is you basically conjure a jinn, and you make deals with them.
[02:24:52.496 --> 02:24:56.218]  And that's the essence of the black magic Illuminati rituals that we
[02:24:57.479 --> 02:24:58.000]  We're good to go.
[02:25:12.007 --> 02:25:15.588]  Let's say, you know, have control over music industry, finance.
[02:25:16.088 --> 02:25:22.511]  You know, if they want to control the Middle East, they have to then make a deal and some kind of sacrifice in exchange, a blood sacrifice.
[02:25:22.531 --> 02:25:26.012]  That's where the sacrifice of children comes in, the sacrifice of soldiers in war.
[02:25:26.452 --> 02:25:29.913]  And what's interesting about the jinn is that they always respond to symbols, signs and symbols.
[02:25:30.293 --> 02:25:36.715]  So, for example, the pyramid, the triangle shape of the pyramid is one, the five-sided star, the six-sided star.
[02:25:36.955 --> 02:25:38.476]  Each one has different meaning for them.
[02:25:39.176 --> 02:25:39.436]  I think?
[02:25:59.093 --> 02:26:04.359]  And again, if you're a new listener and you're like, this sounds crazy, whether it's real or not, the elite really do believe in this.
[02:26:04.379 --> 02:26:06.581]  I mean, that's come out so many times.
[02:26:07.102 --> 02:26:10.225]  When I was in Bohemian Grove, they were taking it all deadly serious.
[02:26:10.625 --> 02:26:13.488]  Why do you think most of the globalists are so obsessed with the pyramid?
[02:26:13.849 --> 02:26:17.473]  Because, you know, they use lots of other symbols, but they love that pyramid.
[02:26:19.093 --> 02:26:20.174]  They do, they love the pyramid.
[02:26:20.194 --> 02:26:22.737]  In fact, you've seen this Kony 2012 campaign that's being run?
[02:26:22.757 --> 02:26:25.800]  It's an upside-down pyramid, which... It's an upside-down pyramid.
[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:27.882]  And it's like the inversion of the Obama campaign.
[02:26:28.042 --> 02:26:29.103]  We are hope, we are change.
[02:26:29.143 --> 02:26:34.188]  And they put the same, like, they put Kony as his picture, just like they put Obama's picture four years ago.
[02:26:34.209 --> 02:26:39.093]  I noticed that they even used that same Soviet-style colors, but then put him by Hitler.
[02:26:39.454 --> 02:26:40.075]  Exactly.
[02:26:40.315 --> 02:26:42.016]  It's like, Obama and the UN are good,
[02:26:43.039 --> 02:26:44.603]  Uh, and Kony is bad.
[02:26:44.684 --> 02:26:47.211]  And what's your view on that and Angelina Jolie?
[02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.659]  Because I found she's at the heart of all these wars.
[02:26:52.026 --> 02:26:54.226]  Well, I mean, I won't comment on her specifically.
[02:26:54.246 --> 02:26:58.647]  What I'll say is the United Nations is a giant occult location and base.
[02:27:00.788 --> 02:27:11.930]  I've heard from multiple people about rituals taking place underground, including a guy in Iran who just went to school at Columbia, and he saw a spiritist seance taking place in one of the rooms he was invited to 30 years ago, in like 79.
[02:27:12.270 --> 02:27:17.031]  No, they admittedly have weird religious rooms that they keep locked up that dignitaries go into.
[02:27:17.714 --> 02:27:21.096]  Yeah, in fact, isn't there the black Kaaba, the Kaaba stone?
[02:27:21.356 --> 02:27:38.003]  See, in Islam, the Kaaba stone is very sacred in Mecca, and because the black stone of the Kaaba, they say, fell to earth from heaven, and frankly, it resembles a little bit the 2001 obelisk that Kubrick intimated was involved in the creation of consciousness on earth.
[02:27:38.063 --> 02:27:39.104]  Yes.
[02:27:39.144 --> 02:27:41.045]  When that black stone falls to earth.
[02:27:41.565 --> 02:27:45.787]  That launches the step from animal to man, right?
[02:27:45.807 --> 02:27:50.010]  Because consciousness is now... Consciousness is this which we cannot describe.
[02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:51.310]  What is it that makes consciousness?
[02:27:51.551 --> 02:27:55.833]  Why is it the human consciousness is at a different level than that of an animal?
[02:27:55.853 --> 02:27:57.274]  You were getting into the sixth senses.
[02:27:58.649 --> 02:28:01.230]  Yeah, the sixth sense, right, beyond the five.
[02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:05.312]  The spirit being the fifth, but what is the sixth, right?
[02:28:07.153 --> 02:28:15.677]  So the point is that when it comes to that black stone at the Kaaba, this is a sacred stone, but they have a similar imitation of it, I believe, in the United Nations.
[02:28:16.337 --> 02:28:16.577]  You know?
[02:28:17.098 --> 02:28:24.223]  So, uh, there's so much... Well, the Queen of England believes she's sworn in on the, uh, a holy stone that they drug back.
[02:28:24.843 --> 02:28:30.067]  Uh, that's the stone that they almost, uh, sacrificed, Abraham almost sacrificed his son on.
[02:28:30.367 --> 02:28:31.227]  That's admitted.
[02:28:31.648 --> 02:28:34.109]  That, uh, and that they really think they're Merovingians.
[02:28:34.149 --> 02:28:35.290]  That's actually mainline.
[02:28:35.971 --> 02:28:38.512]  Yeah, in fact, doesn't she sit on top of a stone like that?
[02:28:38.552 --> 02:28:39.453]  Yeah, she's sworn in.
[02:28:39.493 --> 02:28:40.454]  She's coronated on it.
[02:28:41.064 --> 02:28:41.964]  Right, under her throne.
[02:28:42.305 --> 02:28:48.007]  But I was also told by the Djinn Masters that she commands the Djinn through the stones in her crown.
[02:28:48.407 --> 02:28:50.348]  Because the crown actually is like an antenna.
[02:28:50.908 --> 02:28:58.411]  And the stones, the stones that are put into her crown, those are basically, how do you say?
[02:28:58.571 --> 02:29:02.493]  Djinn basically congregate, like I said, around certain signs, symbols, stones, because it has to do with energy.
[02:29:02.513 --> 02:29:08.195]  That goes back to the lore of the dragon wants a big pile of gold and silver, because the more diamonds and gold they have, the bigger the resonance.
[02:29:09.184 --> 02:29:32.727]  Yeah, well the whole gold issue, you should get into Ben Fulford and David Wilcox and what they've been investigating regarding this fraudulent transactions of gold, the fact that the Chinese are owed tremendous billions of dollars of gold, if not more, they're trying to reclaim it, and every time they do, the US IRS and whatnot basically alleges that those are fraudulent notes that they're holding, so they won't actually return
[02:29:32.807 --> 02:29:34.428]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.488 --> 02:29:35.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.723 --> 02:30:07.707]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:30:07.947 --> 02:30:25.557]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:25.818 --> 02:30:29.940]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:31.781]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[02:32:00.267 --> 02:32:04.510]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:05.450]  Number one.
[02:32:05.731 --> 02:32:08.893]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.173 --> 02:32:09.733]  Number two.
[02:32:10.034 --> 02:32:14.577]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.917 --> 02:32:15.357]  It's true.
[02:32:15.657 --> 02:32:20.220]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.541 --> 02:32:21.081]  Number three.
[02:32:21.361 --> 02:32:24.643]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.943 --> 02:32:28.646]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.846 --> 02:32:29.387]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.647 --> 02:32:32.009]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.409 --> 02:32:35.772]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.072 --> 02:32:36.293]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.873 --> 02:32:40.796]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.017 --> 02:32:45.781]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.061 --> 02:32:50.087]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.247 --> 02:32:51.809]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:54.113]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.273 --> 02:32:56.616]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:14.639 --> 02:33:33.323]  Look, just as an anthropologist, just as a sociologist, just as somebody who looks at civilization and current and past cultures, humans are obsessed with the occult and every elite that ends up getting in power, in every culture, builds pyramids and chops their children's hearts out and drinks their blood.
[02:33:34.603 --> 02:33:40.465]  The Druids, the Aztecs, the Romans did rituals, but the Greeks did human sacrifice.
[02:33:40.965 --> 02:33:41.845]  But it's like a footnote.
[02:33:43.155 --> 02:33:48.997]  Every culture has done it, until you see the worship of the one God.
[02:33:52.258 --> 02:34:00.921]  And, even if you're an atheist or whatever, I mean, do atheists send me emails when I talk about pygmies being animists and worshipping plants and animals?
[02:34:01.201 --> 02:34:03.582]  And say, I don't believe in God, don't tell me about pygmies beliefs.
[02:34:04.882 --> 02:34:09.264]  The point is, the pygmies are worshipping plants and animals, if you look at it from an anthropology
[02:34:10.765 --> 02:34:13.126]  Or sociology, or archaeology angle.
[02:34:14.147 --> 02:34:25.053]  And the globalists, the people that have got 400 plus reactors, 90% of them leaking, that are genetically engineering everything thinking they're God, they are out of their minds power trips.
[02:34:25.194 --> 02:34:27.175]  They believe they're establishing world government.
[02:34:28.836 --> 02:34:33.679]  They're setting it up, they're in control, and they're crazy.
[02:34:33.739 --> 02:34:34.739]  But they are in control.
[02:34:35.019 --> 02:34:35.780]  What do you make
[02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:44.891]  Sean, of the fact, or maybe you disagree, that the globalists are endangering the planet while lecturing us that they want to kill everybody to save it.
[02:34:45.211 --> 02:34:47.334]  I mean, what do you make of where they're taking us?
[02:34:47.494 --> 02:34:54.143]  And who do the elite from your research, into the Illuminati, where do they think this is all going?
[02:34:56.810 --> 02:35:01.276]  I think we've hit this 2012 pretty hard, and it's a fascinating time.
[02:35:01.776 --> 02:35:13.291]  From the point of view of consciousness, there's a new awareness, I think, on the scale of global consciousness from people, the fact that we can communicate across the world through cell phones and the internet, from everywhere from Africa to America.
[02:35:13.811 --> 02:35:14.752]  They're trying to guide this.
[02:35:15.393 --> 02:35:37.360]  to destroy nation-states and actually that's that's why it might came back i took the stand you know sit-in on iran saying leave him alone they have the right to nuclear power including weaponry if need be but the point is that they are net sovereign nation the idea quote the agenda that we've known for over a hundred years of the of the high-level masons and the especially the british elite the british monarchy has been to uh...
[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:38.440]  We're good to go.
[02:36:03.371 --> 02:36:09.894]  Which allowed for our country to exist, based on that same principle, is that a country is sovereign within its borders.
[02:36:09.934 --> 02:36:14.496]  It has the right to develop itself according to its constitution, according to its people's will.
[02:36:14.996 --> 02:36:16.857]  And they say, no, it's not according to your people's will.
[02:36:16.877 --> 02:36:18.018]  It's going to be according to our will.
[02:36:18.238 --> 02:36:20.039]  We're going to blow your country up.
[02:36:20.779 --> 02:36:26.183]  Notice it's a corporate model, just like the British East India Company ran India for hundreds of years.
[02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.544]  It was a private corporation.
[02:36:27.584 --> 02:36:30.746]  That's all globalism is, is they're exempt from the rules.
[02:36:31.026 --> 02:36:32.848]  We're all under this yoke of tyranny.
[02:36:33.989 --> 02:36:37.051]  And now, under Obama, they're launching all these peace wars.
[02:36:37.391 --> 02:36:39.753]  How do you think things are going for the global controllers?
[02:36:40.796 --> 02:36:41.857]  Well, they're in desperate trouble.
[02:36:41.897 --> 02:36:47.822]  I mean, that's why I'm saying read Ben Fulford's work on this gold issue, because there's some serious... It's called the Keegan lawsuit.
[02:36:47.842 --> 02:36:54.128]  These guys are from Chinese side, the so-called Dragon family, are suing the globalists to get their gold back.
[02:36:54.188 --> 02:36:59.973]  Because the point is that there's so much gold that's been hoarded by the Federal Reserve Bank, the Rothschild family, these Western
[02:37:00.774 --> 02:37:03.116]  Illuminati families, basically, have been stealing gold.
[02:37:03.576 --> 02:37:12.923]  And now, through legal means, the Chinese and others are actually trying to, what we call the White Dragon, or the White Hat faction, are trying to get accountability for this gold.
[02:37:13.224 --> 02:37:15.646]  Did you notice that Chavez has demanded his gold?
[02:37:16.516 --> 02:37:25.089]  Good, because what happens is these countries seize them, and the point is that when we invade Iraq, when we and the British invade Libya and Iraq and these countries, we're stealing the gold.
[02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:27.292]  That's what's being looted in the process, you know.
[02:37:27.593 --> 02:37:32.280]  And you're also doing a control disintegration project where you're arming the various sides, so of course, you know, this
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:38.601]  The financier elite is always profiting from financing both sides and creating so-called control disintegration.
[02:37:38.621 --> 02:37:47.363]  If you can't control the system, they then have a policy which is control disintegration of that system, and you try to control the rate of decline and then, you know, by smashing it.
[02:37:47.383 --> 02:37:55.505]  It's like when the Rockefeller empire was smashed, and as opposed to one consolidated power, they then had control of like 20 different companies.
[02:37:55.725 --> 02:38:00.268]  No, it's a Hydra which can even hide better and create monopolies that are even more powerful.
[02:38:00.868 --> 02:38:08.873]  I mean, they say the Rothschilds are obsessed with hiding the fact that they've got trillions in different loot.
[02:38:09.453 --> 02:38:10.114]  And I agree with you.
[02:38:10.154 --> 02:38:13.416]  Things are not going well for the globalists, but that's what's so dangerous.
[02:38:14.156 --> 02:38:15.317]  They're going to want to blow it up.
[02:38:15.417 --> 02:38:16.218]  They want World War III.
[02:38:16.238 --> 02:38:23.644]  I mean, the point about Iran is Russia is the last nation that's actually protecting sovereign nation states at this point.
[02:38:23.664 --> 02:38:31.110]  When Putin said that, you know, you're facing a cult of violence, he's saying that because he knows how insane Obama is and his controllers, his British masters.
[02:38:31.450 --> 02:38:33.092]  And actually, the Jinn people told me that Obama's
[02:38:33.732 --> 02:38:34.032]  All right.
[02:38:58.763 --> 02:38:59.884]  All right, I want to be clear here.
[02:39:00.404 --> 02:39:07.687]  We can prove that in this reality that the British Royalty, the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, they want world government eugenics.
[02:39:08.047 --> 02:39:08.947]  I have their own documents.
[02:39:08.967 --> 02:39:09.768]  That's crazy enough.
[02:39:09.788 --> 02:39:10.548]  People can't believe it.
[02:39:11.188 --> 02:39:13.069]  I've never seen these things you're talking about.
[02:39:13.109 --> 02:39:15.990]  I know the elites believe in them and are very serious about it.
[02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:20.532]  But Sean, I've met you a few times in person, talked to you on the phone, had you on the show.
[02:39:20.852 --> 02:39:22.213]  You come across as a
[02:39:23.573 --> 02:39:37.631]  Nice person who believes what they're saying and you come across as an intelligent person and of course you have a very famous father and then you're here on air saying you've recognized Islam and that you're communicating with entities called genies.
[02:39:37.932 --> 02:39:39.954]  I mean I would be remiss if I didn't say
[02:39:40.635 --> 02:39:44.138]  You know, come on, are you do- I mean, is this some kind of elaborate PSYOP?
[02:39:44.699 --> 02:39:48.382]  Uh, or, or, I mean, or, or is this real things that have happened to you?
[02:39:48.823 --> 02:39:51.806]  And, and, and then why are you saying these things on air, even if they're true?
[02:39:52.146 --> 02:39:54.028]  Are you worried about being, uh, attacked?
[02:39:54.841 --> 02:39:56.983]  No, I'm not saying that I personally communicate with genies.
[02:39:57.103 --> 02:40:04.851]  I mean, I may have, I've received phone calls and communications from people, could be sorcerers, frankly.
[02:40:04.871 --> 02:40:08.054]  I mean, I'm not entirely clear of how, what level of operation they're involved with.
[02:40:08.454 --> 02:40:17.403]  But I mean, whether or not they're CIA, ONI, you know, Defense, the DIA, I mean, there's many different agencies that can be involved in this and that are monitoring me.
[02:40:17.543 --> 02:40:17.984]  This I know.
[02:40:18.925 --> 02:40:19.746]  We're good to go.
[02:40:34.508 --> 02:40:36.049]  People that I don't know exactly who he is.
[02:40:36.429 --> 02:40:37.509]  I've never seen him face-to-face.
[02:40:37.529 --> 02:40:38.490]  I've only received phone calls.
[02:40:39.010 --> 02:40:41.831]  And I'm not sure which intelligence agency he works with.
[02:40:41.851 --> 02:40:44.113]  I'm not sure what faction he's for.
[02:40:44.513 --> 02:40:46.214]  But he told me 55 days till blackout.
[02:40:46.394 --> 02:40:48.735]  55 days later, Virginia got the earthquake.
[02:40:49.055 --> 02:40:54.357]  New York followed the same week that a tsunami hit New York.
[02:40:54.377 --> 02:40:55.278]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:40:55.298 --> 02:40:56.438]  Let me stop you right there.
[02:40:56.458 --> 02:40:59.320]  Let me stop you right there because, you know, when I've talked to you personally,
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:05.923]  And, you know, when we've hung out and, you know, worked on the TV show, I don't bring up the questions that everybody I know constantly brings up.
[02:41:06.483 --> 02:41:16.287]  But, you know, here's your father, one of the most famous directors in history, and I've got to ask you, what does he think about all the things you're doing, or is that private?
[02:41:18.925 --> 02:41:23.069]  There's, you know, you speak with a lot of people around the film business.
[02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:26.252]  There's a little awareness of the spiritist realm.
[02:41:26.312 --> 02:41:31.037]  There's a level of, there's a very strong spiritual realm, spiritual awareness.
[02:41:31.778 --> 02:41:33.800]  He's someone that has gone through that.
[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:34.901]  I mean, you can see it in the Doris.
[02:41:35.842 --> 02:41:39.345]  You can see his relationship to Buddhism that follows with Heaven and Earth and other films.
[02:41:41.227 --> 02:41:42.107]  He's aware of demons.
[02:41:42.167 --> 02:41:43.348]  He's very aware of these things.
[02:41:43.588 --> 02:41:46.828]  Ultimately, does he believe in this, what I'm talking about?
[02:41:46.969 --> 02:41:47.409]  I don't know.
[02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:52.290]  I would say that's a long conversation, and frankly, you know, there's things that he will say and won't say.
[02:41:52.850 --> 02:41:55.271]  The same with Steven Spielberg or any of these people, you know, if you think about it.
[02:41:55.771 --> 02:41:56.671]  Why are they making movies?
[02:41:56.711 --> 02:41:59.012]  Why is he, Spielberg, making movies about aliens so much?
[02:41:59.292 --> 02:41:59.672]  And, uh...
[02:42:00.592 --> 02:42:07.954]  You know, why does Hollywood propagate certain stories, you know, alien invasions, blackouts?
[02:42:08.114 --> 02:42:11.475]  Sure, there's a lot we don't know and that's what the occult's all about.
[02:42:11.535 --> 02:42:13.135]  Let me put it to you this way.
[02:42:13.655 --> 02:42:25.578]  You told me some stuff that fits in with information I've gotten from separate people that are at your level of connections and things I've personally witnessed growing up in Dallas and then also Bohemian Grove, so experiences I've had.
[02:42:26.418 --> 02:42:28.959]  And at the time you didn't say, this is off record, don't say anything.
[02:42:28.979 --> 02:42:30.480]  But later I said, hey, I'm going to bring this up.
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:31.481]  You said, no, no, no.
[02:42:32.101 --> 02:42:35.923]  I mean, when are you going to talk about the things that you know about the Illuminati?
[02:42:37.877 --> 02:42:42.742]  Um, I think that'll come out in the course of the next year if we can do a documentary on this stuff and actually document it.
[02:42:42.822 --> 02:42:43.823]  I mean, I've seen photographs.
[02:42:43.883 --> 02:42:46.746]  I've seen photographs of some of the rituals beyond what you did.
[02:42:46.786 --> 02:42:51.711]  I mean, actual, like, you know, estates, private estates where the cloaks are on.
[02:42:51.731 --> 02:42:54.634]  It looks like, you know, eyes wide shut.
[02:42:54.714 --> 02:42:57.076]  Sean, you haven't just seen photographs, right?
[02:42:57.096 --> 02:42:58.798]  I mean, you've got some other sources here.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:00.620]  I have other sources.
[02:43:00.641 --> 02:43:01.561]  I've never been invited.
[02:43:01.721 --> 02:43:02.382]  I'm hoping to.
[02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:14.770]  Alright, whatever.
[02:43:32.908 --> 02:43:33.129]  This is 2012, 2013.
[02:43:33.189 --> 02:43:34.812]  This is the time for a movie.
[02:43:34.852 --> 02:43:36.275]  Well, look at what happened to Kubrick.
[02:43:36.715 --> 02:43:38.619]  They did cut 24 minutes of that film.
[02:43:38.939 --> 02:43:41.985]  He refused to cut it and died the day he refused because he had final cut.
[02:43:42.406 --> 02:43:43.508]  Then they cut it and released it.
[02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.550]  Yeah.
[02:43:46.421 --> 02:43:47.322]  I can tell you one thing.
[02:43:47.442 --> 02:43:53.985]  My friend Alex, who was on the show with you last time, he saw lights in the sky over, where was it?
[02:43:54.485 --> 02:43:56.266]  It was off the coast of Jersey.
[02:43:56.286 --> 02:43:59.808]  There was a bunch of crazy stuff just happening in Phoenix, but go ahead.
[02:43:59.848 --> 02:44:02.370]  This was actually when Occupy Wall Street had been shut down.
[02:44:02.390 --> 02:44:05.611]  Remember the week that Occupy Wall Street in New York, they shut down Zuccotti Park?
[02:44:06.112 --> 02:44:06.512]  Yeah.
[02:44:06.852 --> 02:44:08.033]  Then they returned to the bridge.
[02:44:08.473 --> 02:44:11.835]  Well, the night they shut it down, there was serious activity in the sky.
[02:44:12.535 --> 02:44:18.278]  On the coast of Jersey, right across from New York upstate, it's like the Pacific Highway there.
[02:44:18.798 --> 02:44:21.680]  And the point is that there was a whole town that got shut down.
[02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:26.002]  Actually, the cops blocked everyone, all traffic, entering this area.
[02:44:26.222 --> 02:44:26.782]  Nyack, I think.
[02:44:26.802 --> 02:44:27.563]  Nyack, New Jersey.
[02:44:28.403 --> 02:44:29.824]  So they block, or is it New York?
[02:44:29.864 --> 02:44:30.364]  Not New York.
[02:44:30.624 --> 02:44:32.865]  But the point is that they block this whole town.
[02:44:33.285 --> 02:44:36.546]  And Alex was checking it out, because he's like, why is there so much going down?
[02:44:36.606 --> 02:44:38.687]  Oh, they said that there was a power outage or something.
[02:44:38.727 --> 02:44:40.208]  But no one was allowed to go to their homes.
[02:44:40.268 --> 02:44:41.028]  No one could even enter.
[02:44:41.388 --> 02:44:43.409]  Well, he saw a couple things in the sky.
[02:44:44.189 --> 02:44:47.371]  And next thing he knows, he's taken in by men in black.
[02:44:48.051 --> 02:44:50.452]  Basically, they arrest him in the woods, where he sees this.
[02:44:50.592 --> 02:44:52.793]  He's thrown into Greystone Mental Hospital for a night.
[02:44:53.553 --> 02:44:54.855]  He then, you know, is drugged.
[02:44:54.875 --> 02:44:55.956]  He calls me from the hospital.
[02:44:56.016 --> 02:44:58.859]  He's like trying to get out, but he's drugged out of his mind.
[02:44:58.899 --> 02:45:00.080]  I just tell him, okay, just sleep it off.
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:01.181]  Wake up in the morning.
[02:45:01.902 --> 02:45:02.443]  He gets out.
[02:45:02.583 --> 02:45:03.524]  He can't get any records.
[02:45:03.584 --> 02:45:04.705]  They deny that he was ever there.
[02:45:05.506 --> 02:45:06.647]  This is how these guys operate.
[02:45:06.807 --> 02:45:07.248]  You understand?
[02:45:07.288 --> 02:45:08.329]  And they try to build a case.
[02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:14.956]  That's why a lot of people who ultimately are around the Illuminati, people like Arizona Wild and others, they end up in mental hospitals because they get forced into it.
[02:45:15.096 --> 02:45:16.037]  And the point is, once you're there,
[02:45:16.257 --> 02:45:18.320]  Well then they use the mental hospital as the cover.
[02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:19.862]  That came out with Ewing Cameron.
[02:45:20.163 --> 02:45:22.106]  Thousands of school children they would kidnap.
[02:45:22.126 --> 02:45:23.127]  This is on History Channel.
[02:45:23.708 --> 02:45:26.052]  In Virginia and up over the border in Canada.
[02:45:26.372 --> 02:45:28.636]  And they would actually create mind control slaves.
[02:45:28.656 --> 02:45:29.837]  This is declassified.
[02:45:30.178 --> 02:45:32.001]  And they would run it out of mental hospitals.
[02:45:32.401 --> 02:45:33.022]  Right, exactly.
[02:45:33.062 --> 02:45:42.408]  In fact, my friend was telling me last night how the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is run by two of the head guys there who are psychiatrists trained from Tavistock in England, right?
[02:45:42.728 --> 02:46:02.261]  So what they'll do is they'll basically, they'll have you go to prisons in, you know, around these countries, in Egypt or Israel, wherever it may be, and they'll basically start to psychically analyze the profile of the prisoners there and decide who's useful to be, you know, a candidate for extremism, for terrorism, for murder, and that's how they recruit people.
[02:46:02.701 --> 02:46:03.642]  No, no, no.
[02:46:03.982 --> 02:46:06.144]  I knew this eight years ago, but now it's been admitted.
[02:46:06.164 --> 02:46:06.885]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:07.726 --> 02:46:11.749]  They have the real camp x-ray at Guantanamo within the base.
[02:46:12.850 --> 02:46:14.831]  Army and CIA psychiatrists run it.
[02:46:15.868 --> 02:46:25.952]  That's why all the new Al-Qaeda leadership are picked up as 14, 15, 16 there, taken, tortured, trained, and then released, and then they command the new Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:27.033 --> 02:46:31.155]  That's why the leader of Al-Qaeda in Syria and the one in
[02:46:33.557 --> 02:46:37.279]  Libya were actually at that base for five or six years apiece.
[02:46:37.299 --> 02:46:38.200]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:42.362]  But it's even admitted that they are in there torturing them and mind controlling them in there.
[02:46:42.702 --> 02:46:45.524]  So Guantanamo is actually a terrorist factory.
[02:46:46.289 --> 02:46:47.570]  Exactly, that's the whole point.
[02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:51.113]  It's the whole British Tavistock style of operating.
[02:46:51.914 --> 02:46:57.058]  You profile people, you build terrorists, you deploy them around the world.
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:00.641]  People have got to wake up to this fact.
[02:47:00.741 --> 02:47:02.162]  Terrorists are known entities.
[02:47:02.182 --> 02:47:04.924]  You can go to any city and talk to a police officer.
[02:47:04.944 --> 02:47:06.305]  They know who the mob guys are.
[02:47:06.566 --> 02:47:09.768]  They know who the drug dealers are.
[02:47:09.808 --> 02:47:12.611]  They know the most likely candidates for murder and crime.
[02:47:13.291 --> 02:47:14.732]  This is just basic police work.
[02:47:14.752 --> 02:47:19.433]  So you're gonna tell me, you know, Osama bin Laden sitting in Pakistan for 10 years and no one even noticed this?
[02:47:20.094 --> 02:47:20.954]  We live in delusion.
[02:47:20.994 --> 02:47:22.414]  We live in the Wizard of Oz reality.
[02:47:22.494 --> 02:47:25.395]  And I think people are waking up step by step.
[02:47:25.416 --> 02:47:28.657]  But the big problem, Alex, is how do you get information across when there's...
[02:47:29.777 --> 02:47:44.335]  How many millions of websites available for information for traffic and then you get Fox News and obviously the major news networks who completely cover up any aspect of reality and they spin you, you know, lies, but at least online there's available information, but there's just so much out there.
[02:47:44.475 --> 02:47:47.819]  What do you think the system's gonna do though to try to block out the awakening?
[02:47:47.839 --> 02:47:49.140]  They're openly wanting to censor now.
[02:47:50.101 --> 02:47:53.763]  They openly want to censor the internet, and I was told that's what the Bilderberg group decided last year.
[02:47:53.783 --> 02:47:54.784]  Who was it?
[02:47:54.824 --> 02:47:56.325]  The famous Estulin.
[02:47:56.365 --> 02:47:59.227]  Daniel Estulin, I think, said that from the last Bilderberg conference.
[02:47:59.567 --> 02:48:00.447]  That was discussed.
[02:48:00.528 --> 02:48:04.130]  The policy agenda would be to censor the internet as best they could.
[02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:06.811]  And then there was obviously this bill that was brought up earlier this year.
[02:48:06.831 --> 02:48:07.932]  I'm not sure what happened with it.
[02:48:08.412 --> 02:48:14.216]  No, Jim Tucker said the same thing, and then boom, as soon as that conference was over, it began in earnest.
[02:48:15.455 --> 02:48:16.356]  Let me raise this point.
[02:48:16.997 --> 02:48:19.799]  So it's fair to say the media twisted what you said.
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:29.169]  All you did was recognize that Islam, from its founding, from your perspective, is worshiping the same God and we shouldn't have war with each other.
[02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:35.335]  They spun that like it was a bad thing and that you had now, you know, basically gotten married to Ahmadinejad.
[02:48:36.997 --> 02:48:42.860]  Well, you know, I ultimately ended up becoming his defender when I was simply trying to point out that he's not a madman.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:50.545]  You see, if you can turn the president of that country into a madman, some mad dictator, then you can't have dialogue with the guy, right?
[02:48:50.565 --> 02:48:52.866]  You can't have dialogue with that country, even though he doesn't even run the country.
[02:48:53.366 --> 02:49:01.553]  But aside from that fact, you know, that he's a president within a Republican structure and doesn't have as much power as our president, who's, you know, the biggest fascist in the world at this point.
[02:49:01.993 --> 02:49:03.775]  But I'll get into that in a second.
[02:49:03.915 --> 02:49:11.702]  Because the point is that if Ahmadinejad is mad and he's a warmonger and he wants to destroy Israel, we can't talk to him, we can't negotiate with him, we have to attack.
[02:49:12.162 --> 02:49:12.622]  We're good to go.
[02:49:30.009 --> 02:49:37.051]  That's all the ammunition now to destroy Obama, because Obama's the guy leading us into this goddamn war, the same way that he put the NDAA in place.
[02:49:37.091 --> 02:49:40.452]  He asked Carl Levin and the Congress to make sure that U.S.
[02:49:40.493 --> 02:49:42.333]  citizens cannot be targeted by our military.
[02:49:42.413 --> 02:49:42.513]  U.S.
[02:49:42.553 --> 02:49:43.954]  citizens can be picked up and detained.
[02:49:44.254 --> 02:49:45.354]  Are we out of our minds?
[02:49:45.414 --> 02:49:46.414]  What happened to our country?
[02:49:46.455 --> 02:49:50.376]  We've destroyed the Constitution blatantly, openly, and no one says a thing.
[02:49:50.956 --> 02:49:52.156]  Well, I'm glad you raised that.
[02:49:52.196 --> 02:49:53.557]  We have the NDAA passing.
[02:49:53.577 --> 02:49:55.917]  They're passing laws for felonies if you protest.
[02:49:56.437 --> 02:50:02.159]  They're openly saying the UN and globalists run war-making powers, and the Congress is vestigial.
[02:50:02.199 --> 02:50:03.499]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:04.960]  Off the charts?
[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.420]  He's assassinated American citizens.
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:08.121]  He's deploying drones across the country.
[02:50:08.561 --> 02:50:10.721]  But more importantly, he states openly, U.S.
[02:50:10.761 --> 02:50:13.422]  citizens can be detained indefinitely by the military.
[02:50:13.882 --> 02:50:16.103]  Okay, destroy due process, destroy habeas corpus.
[02:50:16.843 --> 02:50:18.985]  That's our constitutional basis right there.
[02:50:19.085 --> 02:50:19.525]  The U.S.
[02:50:19.565 --> 02:50:21.587]  military is going to be used against our citizens?
[02:50:23.628 --> 02:50:25.009]  They now have martial law in place.
[02:50:25.069 --> 02:50:27.771]  The only question is when they want to use it and to what extent.
[02:50:28.132 --> 02:50:32.995]  And we basically said, oh, because it's Obama and he seems like a smart guy, the guy is like Felsa Doom from Conan.
[02:50:33.035 --> 02:50:36.398]  He's a cult leader with a good voice and he knows how to hypnotize people.
[02:50:36.418 --> 02:50:37.238]  That's the way I look at it.
[02:50:37.679 --> 02:50:39.360]  And we better get him out of office so we can get
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:40.060]  No, I've gotta say it.
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.841]  I mean, as bad as Bush was, Obama is even worse.
[02:50:41.921 --> 02:50:44.441]  I mean, he is just totally assassinating the Republic right now.
[02:50:44.461 --> 02:50:46.502]  We'll break it down straight ahead with Sean Stone.
[02:51:01.457 --> 02:51:08.281]  2012 is finally here, and while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[02:51:08.741 --> 02:51:12.963]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[02:51:13.243 --> 02:51:23.208]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns, or are receiving threatening letters or phone calls, call the Tax Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[02:51:23.268 --> 02:51:25.849]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent
[02:51:29.631 --> 02:51:36.415]  With over 31 years experience, he knows the ins and outs of the IRS and how to get them off your back once and for all.
[02:51:36.795 --> 02:51:40.298]  The phone call is free, and so is the consultation, so call now!

[02:53:02.981 --> 02:53:04.122]  Claire, it's Anne.
[02:53:04.222 --> 02:53:07.083]  Hey, you know that hormone-balancing product we talked about before?
[02:53:07.183 --> 02:53:07.964]  The all-natural one.
[02:53:08.224 --> 02:53:08.564]  Ambrin?
[02:53:08.684 --> 02:53:09.825]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[02:53:10.125 --> 02:53:17.209]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[02:53:17.309 --> 02:53:19.030]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[02:53:19.130 --> 02:53:19.630]  It's gone.
[02:53:19.650 --> 02:53:21.911]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[02:53:22.111 --> 02:53:22.792]  I feel great.
[02:53:22.952 --> 02:53:23.472]  Give me a call.
[02:53:23.612 --> 02:53:27.094]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:53:27.294 --> 02:53:30.835]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[02:53:31.095 --> 02:53:35.337]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[02:53:35.517 --> 02:53:37.638]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:53:37.778 --> 02:53:40.679]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:45.201]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[02:53:52.125 --> 02:53:52.185]  1-800-408-1130.
[02:54:09.465 --> 02:54:16.071]  But you can't turn things around until you can actually recognize that you have a problem.
[02:54:30.382 --> 02:54:31.803]  We'll be back tonight with the Nightly News.
[02:54:31.843 --> 02:54:33.523]  Seven o'clock back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:54:33.543 --> 02:54:35.904]  We've only got five minutes left with Sean Stone.
[02:54:36.444 --> 02:54:37.384]  Always great to have him on.
[02:54:37.425 --> 02:54:38.945]  Sean, I never ask you this.
[02:54:39.445 --> 02:54:44.447]  What's the best web address or place to go for people to find some of the things you're up to?
[02:54:44.467 --> 02:54:46.168]  Oh, man.
[02:54:46.248 --> 02:54:47.188]  I gotta start the website.
[02:54:47.288 --> 02:54:48.128]  That's all there is to it.
[02:54:48.148 --> 02:54:53.010]  You know, I've been posting all these interviews and whatnot on Facebook.
[02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:55.031]  They're obviously on YouTube, but I have to consolidate it.
[02:54:55.351 --> 02:54:56.291]  And now's the time to do it.
[02:54:56.371 --> 02:54:58.372]  So once I get it up, I'll let you know.
[02:54:59.278 --> 02:55:04.315]  Alright, we've got five minutes left, so there's so many questions I've got, but what are points you'd like to make before we're out of time?
[02:55:05.979 --> 02:55:09.581]  I mean, the point is that, you know, we've got to avoid this World War III, first of all.
[02:55:09.621 --> 02:55:10.421]  This is very serious.
[02:55:10.441 --> 02:55:16.284]  I mean, the Russians are not joking when they say that they don't want to see Iran attacked or the Syrian regime overthrown.
[02:55:16.544 --> 02:55:19.485]  And we don't know to what level they'll actually go in terms of putting boots on the ground.
[02:55:19.525 --> 02:55:21.006]  I mean, don't forget, Iran is on their border.
[02:55:21.026 --> 02:55:23.067]  It shares the Caspian Sea with them, right?
[02:55:23.527 --> 02:55:30.110]  And historically, the Russians have been known to intervene, whether it be Afghanistan or Georgia, when the West starts to mess around and screw around on its border.
[02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:34.532]  So, if you, you know, if you think that, oh, we're just going to bomb Iran, Iran's
[02:55:35.692 --> 02:55:36.012]  I don't know.
[02:55:56.820 --> 02:55:56.960]  I think?
[02:56:18.098 --> 02:56:26.483]  One hand he says we want to talk to Iran, the other hand he's basically bolstering Israel and apparently cutting deals like, you know, saying hold off the attack until after the election.
[02:56:26.743 --> 02:56:27.824]  But it may not be that long.
[02:56:27.864 --> 02:56:33.688]  The point is, these guys want it, as the Joint Chiefs have said, they want it before summer, by about June.
[02:56:33.748 --> 02:56:37.570]  Because by June, sandstorms start to pick up, it becomes much more risky an operation.
[02:56:37.950 --> 02:56:40.712]  And now three aircraft carriers are mashing there.
[02:56:42.256 --> 02:56:44.979]  People have to understand, it's not America versus Russia.
[02:56:45.019 --> 02:56:57.391]  The global bankers are playing all these countries off against each other and they want to sit back and watch us go into debt and use the war as a distraction from them absorbing the Euro and announcing world government.
[02:56:58.081 --> 02:56:58.541]  Exactly.
[02:56:58.701 --> 02:56:59.042]  Exactly.
[02:56:59.062 --> 02:57:00.222]  And that's their next step.
[02:57:00.242 --> 02:57:02.444]  But the real thing is these guys are lunatics.
[02:57:02.484 --> 02:57:06.166]  I mean, are they going to prompt a nuclear engagement between the sides?
[02:57:06.206 --> 02:57:07.927]  Because obviously that's what's being looked at right now.
[02:57:08.027 --> 02:57:15.092]  I mean, the Russian military and our military are looking at the old mutual assured destruction scenarios in terms of their technologies.
[02:57:15.132 --> 02:57:17.813]  Now, obviously, their technologies advanced 20 years or more.
[02:57:17.873 --> 02:57:21.876]  We don't know exactly where we are with these electromagnetic pulse weapons, things that could
[02:57:22.196 --> 02:57:22.996]  You just hit the key.
[02:57:23.036 --> 02:57:29.738]  They are building bunkers, storing food, getting martial law ready publicly, and setting up an architecture for World War III.
[02:57:29.758 --> 02:57:31.519]  I mean, they are, again, Europe and Latin America
[02:57:48.383 --> 02:57:50.145]  The Middle East, they're not even the primary target.
[02:57:50.505 --> 02:57:55.108]  We in the West are the target of this war because, again, the globalists are outside of us.
[02:57:55.128 --> 02:57:56.590]  They're playing us off against each other.
[02:57:57.210 --> 02:57:57.570]  Precisely.
[02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:58.911]  These guys have no allegiance to America.
[02:57:59.031 --> 02:58:03.092]  We've got to stop thinking that this financial faction of Wall Street has anything to do with America.
[02:58:03.132 --> 02:58:05.573]  Wall Street is the biggest terrorist we face as American people.
[02:58:05.913 --> 02:58:07.114]  Our enemy is imperialism.
[02:58:07.454 --> 02:58:09.014]  We are a sovereign republic.
[02:58:09.055 --> 02:58:14.176]  We believe in the idea of a republic being sovereign over its territory, over its finance and economics.
[02:58:14.537 --> 02:58:16.017]  Wall Street has no allegiance to us.
[02:58:16.457 --> 02:58:17.458]  So why should we have allegiance to them?
[02:58:17.478 --> 02:58:19.819]  Why are we bailing out these guys who are international in their nature?
[02:58:19.839 --> 02:58:22.380]  It's not just that they don't have allegiance, as you said.
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:25.701]  Wall Street is financing getting rid of our republic and our freedom.
[02:58:26.281 --> 02:58:26.681]  Exactly.
[02:58:26.721 --> 02:58:27.962]  They're the biggest terrorists we face.
[02:58:28.002 --> 02:58:31.664]  Wall Street has terrorized more people than Iran ever could in America, you know, across the world.
[02:58:31.844 --> 02:58:36.547]  Sean, I want to get you back up next week or even sooner just on Iran because this is so important.
[02:58:37.367 --> 02:58:38.768]  Just amazing information.
