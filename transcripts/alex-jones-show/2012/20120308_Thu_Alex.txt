[00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.390]  For the first time in my life
[00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:40.644]  I was unable to speak this morning for about 20 minutes.
[00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:44.705]  I don't know how to describe the feeling.
[00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:55.987]  Words can't describe it, but I sat there at the computer from about 7 a.m.
[00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:57.467]  until about 10 a.m.
[00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:02.848]  when I hurried in and got dressed and drove into the office
[00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:25.022]  Thinking about everything I've learned and everything I've seen and watching a video that I saw up at InfoWars.com and also this morning, it was the top story.
[00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:38.717]  On Drudge Report, big headline, Secretary of Defense, authority to launch war comes from international bodies, not Congress.
[00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:45.001]  Now, I knew that they were doing this, and I knew this was the plan.
[00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:54.847]  And I knew that Obama, last year, said, I don't need Congress's approval to launch this war in Libya, I get it from the UN.
[00:01:56.035 --> 00:02:00.237]  Which is as bad as it gets on so many fronts.
[00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:09.442]  To launch a war without congressional approval is treason.
[00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:12.344]  It is despotism.
[00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:16.486]  It is the purest textbook form of tyrant.
[00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:25.391]  But there's something above tyrant in the escalation of absolute evil.
[00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:48.494]  And that is complete and total espionage and the usurpation of our country.
[00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:53.337]  Obama is simply not becoming a Julius Caesar.
[00:02:56.685 --> 00:03:01.826]  In 49 BC, crossing the Rubicon and declaring the Senate vestigial and ceremonial.
[00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:06.368]  That's what happened here at one level.
[00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:08.688]  Without a bang.
[00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:10.348]  Not even with a whimper.
[00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:16.190]  Caesar did it for what he believed the greater power of Rome.
[00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.571]  And it did lead to the eventual destruction of the Empire before it swole.
[00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:35.102]  This is openly being done by foreign powers, a foreign global corporate power, known as the New World Order, the private megabanks.
[00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:40.224]  So the President is not just as bad as a Julius Caesar, a tyrant.
[00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:43.485]  Tyrannous.
[00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.487]  Terrible tyrant.
[00:03:47.587 --> 00:03:48.348]  King tyrant.
[00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:50.428]  Rex Tyranus.
[00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.849]  King tyrant.
[00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:53.910]  It is beyond this.
[00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:04.194]  He is now, Obama and his cohorts and the Pentagon brass are 100% convicted publicly by their own actions.
[00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:12.899]  Of absolute sedition and warfare against the Republic of the United States, and they should all be arrested.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:26.269]  Senator Sessions, when the brass and the Secretary of Defense repeatedly said, no, we follow foreign orders, he should have immediately had the Sergeant of Arms arrest them all on the spot.
[00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.311]  And the Senator's like, I'm breathless, I'm having trouble breathing.
[00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:33.312]  Because ladies and gentlemen, that is what this is.
[00:04:33.452 --> 00:04:38.595]  I mean, this is like out of Star Wars, Emperor Palpatine saying, I am the Senate.
[00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:44.377]  I mean, it's beyond crossing the Rubicon.
[00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:46.959]  It is just flabbergasting.
[00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:49.680]  And of course, I'm the extremist for saying that.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.302]  This is as clear as
[00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.058]  As clear as it gets.
[00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.583]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:18.072]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:20.474]  eFoods direct family packs are the answer.

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.761]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:08.003]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:08.283 --> 00:06:09.643]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:18.607]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:26.429]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:34.491]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:39.793]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:06:59.935 --> 00:07:06.900]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:24.792]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:29.155]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:30.516]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:32.637]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:07.799]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.441]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:15.984]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:23.528]  This is a very grave broadcast that we're about to engage in here today.
[00:08:25.427 --> 00:08:28.570]  The information we're about to cover is so important that I have cleared the decks.
[00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.750]  There are no guests today.
[00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:42.340]  I hope that you realize the information I'm about to cover is of the absolute greatest importance to not just the United States, but everyone on this planet.
[00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:51.067]  This morning, as I watched congressional testimony clips from yesterday,
[00:08:52.638 --> 00:09:01.100]  I was so blown away that when my wife came in and tried to talk to me, I told her, I cannot talk to you.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.161]  And it was not drama.
[00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:05.721]  She'd never seen me in 14 years act like this.
[00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.062]  She said, what's wrong?
[00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:11.683]  And I said, you see what's on the screen.
[00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:16.804]  And she went in the other room and watched it and came back and said, my God, do we need to get out of here?
[00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:21.165]  She said, everything in my gut tells me get out of here.
[00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:32.531]  But I've promised to stay in the United States, but just what hit me is that we've been right about it all, except that it's worse than we said.
[00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:50.821]  And it's so real, and it's so horrible, and it's so destructive and dangerous, and we know exactly where it leads, because humans behave the same over and over again in history.
[00:09:52.915 --> 00:10:13.305]  We are forced to either exert ourselves to the maximum extent to reverse this, or to run to the hills.
[00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:15.066]  And that goes for everybody.
[00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:18.568]  What is going to unfold on this planet
[00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:35.233]  is by its design constructed to destroy and to pull down and to assault everything good.
[00:10:38.516 --> 00:10:47.465]  It is the final revolution that the globalists have talked about against humanity itself, against the nation-state, against the individual, against every institution,
[00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.092]  By the globalists.
[00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:58.938]  Against property rights, the family, everything.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.902]  Free speech, all of it.
[00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:03.964]  On fire right now.
[00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:06.587]  What do I speak of?
[00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:12.592]  And we're going to play the video in its entirety, and I'm going to be stopping it and making comments.
[00:11:12.732 --> 00:11:22.500]  But here is the headline, Panetta, international permission for war trumps congressional permission for military actions.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:33.790]  Now, that's the headline that the video of Defense Secretary Panetta in congressional testimony with Dempsey and others said.
[00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:36.552]  But it's worse than that.
[00:11:36.572 --> 00:11:37.473]  I mean, that's a quote.
[00:11:37.853 --> 00:11:42.256]  But they went on to say, Congress isn't even in the loop.
[00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:51.403]  And the Senators begin to breathe heavy and actually flush red in shock.
[00:11:52.704 --> 00:12:02.250]  And Senator Sessions starts saying, I'm actually losing my
[00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:11.353]  I'm breathless because here are the generals, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others all behind the Secretary of Defense.
[00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:27.386]  And while they're saying this to the Armed Services Committee, their bosses, they all have a belligerent attitude.
[00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:32.410]  And Panetta,
[00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:42.932]  Over and over again, because I watched the compilation and then went to C-SPAN and actually found the entire hearing and sat there for an hour watching it, and it's even worse than the compilation shows.
[00:12:45.153 --> 00:12:47.255]  Now, I knew they were already doing this.
[00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.959]  And I'm going to break down, if you're a new listener, why this is the biggest deal ever.
[00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:01.445]  I already knew they were doing this, but to have them get before Congress
[00:13:02.642 --> 00:13:31.187]  that passes the laws and controls the purse string and declares war and that commissions officers the Congress is the boss of the military and the Congress then hands a bill of war with direct orders to the top general only in a time of war declared by them and then he becomes the commander-in-chief only during that prescribed piece of legislation
[00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:33.235]  And that mission.
[00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:39.679]  Because you don't want the president being able to become a dictator and declare war on their own.
[00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:56.469]  As we've seen thousands of times in history, hundreds and hundreds of times in the last 200 years in Latin America alone, sometimes three or four times a year per country, different generals declare themselves el jefe, the chief, the boss, el presidente, leader for life.
[00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:05.031]  Presidents, Prime Ministers, Roman Senators constantly would declare themselves military dictator.
[00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:14.317]  But this goes one further on this day that lives in infamy.
[00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:24.944]  Today is Thursday, March 8th, 2012, but as they said in the Times of Caesar, beware the Ides of March.
[00:14:25.644 --> 00:14:26.645]  Let the day
[00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:34.660]  Of Wednesday, March 7th, 2012 be a day that lives in infamy.
[00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:45.328]  Just as last year there was another date that I said was a major milestone when Obama put out a public letter from the White House and said, I don't need anything from Congress.
[00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:47.450]  Congress has no authority over war.
[00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.291]  Read the letter.
[00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:49.992]  We link to it in our article that we've written.
[00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:51.714]  Paul Watson's written on the subject.
[00:14:53.647 --> 00:15:00.649]  And he says, I do this through the authority of the UN and for the credibility of the UN.
[00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:02.309]  So it's a precedent.
[00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:19.973]  And so, in an act of brazen precedent, the Secretary of Defense, approved and confirmed by Congress, funded by Congress, came before the Senate,
[00:15:22.478 --> 00:15:26.720]  And told them, you are not in the equation.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.461]  And they'd say, but the Congress is over war powers.
[00:15:30.662 --> 00:15:31.662]  That's the Constitution.
[00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:34.964]  And the military brass and Panetta said no.
[00:15:35.764 --> 00:15:38.685]  The United Nations and NATO and foreign bodies.
[00:15:39.446 --> 00:15:45.428]  And the Senators are all looking at them, because they all know this has already happened, but now it's being openly spoken.
[00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:48.890]  Now the world is being told, you're a joke, Senate!
[00:15:56.678 --> 00:16:02.121]  Suddenly, all over the United States, there are regular Army and Marine Corps checkpoints run by TSA on the streets.
[00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.322]  They call them TSA inspectors.
[00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.924]  All the TSA inspectors are coming with the Army.
[00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:11.525]  Just feds, completely out of their jurisdiction.
[00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:16.833]  Engaging in a slow-motion martial law rollout to acclimate everyone.
[00:16:17.293 --> 00:16:26.457]  And now, not just at the Kite Festival, but at other events now, the Army and National Guard and State Guard are at the events, searching and directing people.
[00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:28.038]  Where I live now!
[00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:32.620]  Two weeks ago, it was Army and TSA in Dallas.
[00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:35.682]  Now it's in Austin, and it's in your town.
[00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:37.362]  This is it!
[00:16:38.483 --> 00:16:40.624]  Now, let me explain why this is beyond
[00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:47.793]  Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon on January 10th, 49 B.C.
[00:16:49.234 --> 00:17:10.508]  Leading one legion, Legio, the 8th of Gemini, Julius Caesar, General Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, the boundary between the Gaul province and
[00:17:12.196 --> 00:17:13.777]  The main province of Rome, Italy.
[00:17:14.877 --> 00:17:26.804]  To the north, and Italy proper to the south, a legally prescribed action forbidden to any army leading general.
[00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:35.749]  It was designed, and the prohibition was set in place, as the greatest law in Rome.
[00:17:37.827 --> 00:17:41.970]  To protect the Roman Republic from a coup d'etat, internal military threat.
[00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:45.893]  Thus Caesar's military action began a civil war.
[00:17:46.773 --> 00:17:57.241]  This act of war on the Roman Republic by Julius Caesar led to widespread approval amongst the Roman civilians who believed him to be a hero.
[00:17:58.262 --> 00:18:06.868]  The historical records differ about which decisive comment Caesar made on crossing the Rubicon.
[00:18:10.455 --> 00:18:18.021]  But the most historically referenced is the die is cast.
[00:18:21.103 --> 00:18:22.724]  Because he was committing himself at that point.
[00:18:22.764 --> 00:18:24.685]  Now, was he an enemy of Rome?
[00:18:25.486 --> 00:18:26.427]  He believed he wasn't.
[00:18:26.447 --> 00:18:27.888]  He wasn't working for a foreign power.
[00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:29.769]  But he was killed for it.
[00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.670]  In the Senate.
[00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:37.575]  But that idea of having a king, a Caesar, began to degenerate the empire.
[00:18:38.922 --> 00:18:42.466]  Because if you don't have basic law you have nothing and corruption set in.
[00:18:43.707 --> 00:19:00.804]  This is far worse what we face because the generals didn't announce that the president had the power, which is on its face a total fraud and well known to anyone who's read the Constitution or swore an oath to it like these officers have.
[00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:03.913]  It's the first thing you're taught in ROTC.
[00:19:04.713 --> 00:19:06.715]  First thing you're taught in officer training.
[00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:08.116]  First thing you're taught in the military.
[00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:11.139]  First thing in your handbook is the chain of command.
[00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:11.719]  They know that.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.705]  They know it's Congress, controlled by the American people, and the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:20.807]  Let me state it clearly.
[00:19:22.428 --> 00:19:23.689]  This is beyond treason.
[00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.165]  This is invasion.
[00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:28.468]  This is war against America.
[00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:31.091]  Just reading to you from Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:19:31.632 --> 00:19:34.516]  Caesar's Act was an act of war against the Roman Republic.
[00:19:35.157 --> 00:19:36.178]  This is beyond that.
[00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:42.146]  Because Obama and his cohorts openly work for foreign mega-central banks.
[00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:49.539]  And corporations who have created this international body to cede domestic power to themselves.
[00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:54.346]  This is an international corporate coup d'etat against America.
[00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:58.632]  And all of these people pushing this should be arrested today!
[00:20:00.487 --> 00:20:08.869]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:13.110]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.751]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.891]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.692]  37 pounds in two months.
[00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:26.433]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:35.297]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:36.537]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:40.719]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself that I truly believe in.

[00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:35.315]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:41.199]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:24:13.624 --> 00:24:13.964]  Okay.
[00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:24.836]  Again, I want to be very, very clear here with everyone who is listening to us on the radio across the United States and worldwide.
[00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:28.640]  Everyone watching us at Infowarsnews.com.
[00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:32.964]  I am giving you 100% common law.
[00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:45.800]  Back to Rome over 2200 years, common law in England, common law here in the US, the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, all of it.
[00:24:47.742 --> 00:24:49.764]  I'm going to play these clips coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:50.044 --> 00:24:57.812]  When you have the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, the Secretary of Defense, before the Senate, and they're saying,
[00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.208]  You haven't come to us to launch the Libya war.
[00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:07.732]  You haven't come to us to launch these new operations in Syria.
[00:25:10.854 --> 00:25:12.976]  If you want to launch these wars, you've got to come to us.
[00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:16.259]  And by the way, the Congress wants these wars, these proxy wars.
[00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:19.401]  But they're like, but you've got to get authority from us.
[00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:29.009]  And the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talking to their bosses, the Congress, that control the purse and the war powers,
[00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:31.253]  Tell them no.
[00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:36.281]  We get it from the president who gets it from international bodies.
[00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:39.386]  And they say the UN-NATO.
[00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.791]  Now see, the same thing's happened in Europe.
[00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:58.041]  If you look at Europe, they're telling them the 25 member states of the EU can't get out of the Euro, and that private mega-banks are now appointing the Prime Ministers and Presidents and raising taxes and cutting benefits to pay off debts created by the bankers.
[00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:01.964]  And so it's in Forbes, it's in the Economist, it's in the Financial Times.
[00:26:02.344 --> 00:26:06.827]  Oh, the technocrats aren't elected and they're setting up a global private corporate government they know best.
[00:26:08.028 --> 00:26:09.609]  Open world government, out in the open,
[00:26:11.047 --> 00:26:25.752]  And it's the same private groups those countries over time have had globalist agents put in who've signed more and more authority over to these NATO bodies, IMF, World Bank, OECD, all these groups.
[00:26:26.192 --> 00:26:29.553]  And now those groups are saying, okay, you no longer as a country have any authority.
[00:26:29.933 --> 00:26:32.134]  Europe is being told this and you can't get out.
[00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:33.715]  That's all a fraud.
[00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:34.855]  It's all been done by fraud.
[00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:40.037]  So they're dissolving the nation states and transferring these corporate bodies.
[00:26:41.055 --> 00:26:48.699]  I mean, imagine these senators who are haughty and full of themselves on so many fronts, but it's the separation of powers, as the founders did.
[00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:50.660]  They separated the powers so you couldn't get a dictator.
[00:26:51.741 --> 00:26:57.844]  And so if somebody tried to become one, other powerful people aren't going to want to have their power taken, even if they're immoral.
[00:26:58.924 --> 00:27:01.146]  There's very few moral up there like Ron Paul.
[00:27:01.766 --> 00:27:06.188]  Kucinich had a warped value system, but was a moral guy who believed in what he was doing.
[00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:08.249]  He's been removed.
[00:27:08.649 --> 00:27:09.450]  He just lost.
[00:27:11.414 --> 00:27:16.056]  He, of course, was leading 10 Congress people suing Obama over the illegal Libya war.
[00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:21.419]  Congress sent him letters and said, you gotta at least get authorization, forget award declaration.
[00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:23.660]  They said, no, I got the UN giving me authority.
[00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:31.445]  So this isn't like Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon and saying, I'll do whatever I want, 2000 plus years ago, 2050 something years ago.
[00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:35.265]  This is worse.
[00:27:35.345 --> 00:27:39.668]  This is Obama financed by the big mega banks, by foreign interest.
[00:27:40.168 --> 00:27:45.171]  You see, it isn't really new to have foreign corporate interest take over your country.
[00:27:46.112 --> 00:27:54.557]  The British East India, the Dutch East India Company ran entire areas of the Pacific, entire areas of Asia, China, India.
[00:27:54.797 --> 00:27:55.658]  Corporations did.
[00:27:56.178 --> 00:27:57.099]  Their own militaries.
[00:27:58.219 --> 00:27:58.660]  In fact, it is
[00:28:05.595 --> 00:28:09.376]  The model that came out of Italy from its nation states into England 500 years ago.
[00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:11.617]  It is the black nobility model.
[00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:17.438]  And British troops and others would be landed to serve these private corporations.
[00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.119]  And that's what the New World Order is.
[00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:22.879]  That's what Cecil Rhodes said it was.
[00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:23.720]  Wrote books on it.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.840]  That's what...
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.461]  Futurist, he wrote more non-fiction than he did fiction, H.G.
[00:28:31.481 --> 00:28:32.141]  Wells wrote about.
[00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:39.823]  This is a global, corporate, socialist combine run by the ultra-rich to shut down free market for everybody else but them.
[00:28:40.943 --> 00:28:45.384]  And laws and bureaucracy to shut everybody down but them, they're all exempt.
[00:28:46.944 --> 00:28:53.646]  And so we now have the spectacle of the Senate and the House, the Congress being told, you don't matter.
[00:28:53.926 --> 00:28:55.006]  And they're like, yeah we do,
[00:28:57.366 --> 00:28:59.028]  The Constitution, you swear an oath to that.
[00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:02.552]  And it says the Congress is in charge, and they go, no you're not.
[00:29:03.013 --> 00:29:04.054]  Panetta goes, no you're not.
[00:29:04.314 --> 00:29:06.137]  And you watch the generals, they're getting off on it.
[00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:09.641]  Their body language is, you bet, we're in charge.
[00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:13.806]  Folks, this is exactly what happens in Guatemala or Nigeria.
[00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:16.509]  I mean, it's here.
[00:29:17.828 --> 00:29:19.750]  And it totally freaked the Senate out.
[00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.791]  There's multiple Senators and House members.
[00:29:22.211 --> 00:29:22.912]  Breaking news!
[00:29:22.952 --> 00:29:25.513]  Representative Jones puts Obama on notice.
[00:29:26.314 --> 00:29:35.300]  Representative Walter Jones, Republican of North Carolina, introduced H. Concurrent Resolution 107, which calls on the House and the Senate concurring into the following.
[00:29:35.981 --> 00:29:43.126]  To put the President on notice of articles of impeachment for violation of the Constitution and treachery against the Republic.
[00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:48.482]  This is, this is not rhetoric, this is an act of war against America.
[00:29:49.643 --> 00:29:52.646]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.567 --> 00:29:56.270]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:01.579]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:06.961]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.201 --> 00:30:11.843]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.223 --> 00:30:17.305]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:17.805 --> 00:30:22.487]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.007 --> 00:30:29.929]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.441]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:15.290]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.297 --> 00:31:20.018]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:05.063]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:33:28.035 --> 00:33:32.437]  This is an extremely grave time that we're in right now.
[00:33:34.878 --> 00:33:46.722]  I am begging you to listen to me carefully because I'm going to have Paul Watson put out another article in the next hour or two on this subject with congressional phone numbers.
[00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:50.806]  We have to have a plan of action.
[00:33:50.886 --> 00:34:07.329]  You know, when it comes to saying call Congress, tell them get rid of the TSA, when enough Congress people get harassed by TSA, they are having hearings and legislation to point out that they cannot engage in law enforcement activities, they're not bondage sworn officers, that they've got to stay within the Constitution.
[00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:15.991]  It takes time, but you can force something on Congress when there's enough pressure and when it's morally indefensible.
[00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:22.614]  And I could use a lot of other examples, but on this subject, Congress gets it.
[00:34:23.375 --> 00:34:30.321]  Congress knows that they are the largest, most diverse body representing the states, the House and the Senate.
[00:34:30.341 --> 00:34:41.431]  A lot of them are corrupt, a lot of them are bad, but they understand that when the military comes before them, they've always been the bosses in the chain of command.
[00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.331]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman always say, yes sir.
[00:34:45.912 --> 00:34:49.693]  They all, you know, the Secretary of Defense would never.
[00:34:51.414 --> 00:35:03.599]  This would be the equivalent, I hate to use gross analogies, of going up to a mega church in front of 5,000 people and pulling your pants down and defecating in front of the altar.
[00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:08.861]  I hate to use a gross analogy, but that's what this, I mean, this is so over the top.
[00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:14.911]  This is so 100% treason, but beyond treason.
[00:35:15.952 --> 00:35:17.692]  This is treachery.
[00:35:17.773 --> 00:35:18.873]  This is invasion.
[00:35:19.233 --> 00:35:21.354]  This is war against the Republic.
[00:35:21.634 --> 00:35:35.140]  I was just reading to you from the Encyclopedia Britannica on Roman law and the 49 BC crossing in the Rubicon by Julius Caesar, which was an act of war against the Roman Republic and ended up destroying it.
[00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:38.682]  And he was a popular super general.
[00:35:41.189 --> 00:35:42.090]  This is beyond that.
[00:35:42.370 --> 00:36:00.062]  This is a group of financial interest that have gotten control of the presidency, gotten control of most of the governorships, gotten control of many House and Senate members, gotten control, gotten the government to sign on to their 1.5 quadrillion in fraudulent paper derivatives they created in the last 12, 13 years.
[00:36:00.522 --> 00:36:00.702]  Since 1999.
[00:36:01.763 --> 00:36:02.303]  Glass-Steagall.
[00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:04.205]  Being removed.
[00:36:05.285 --> 00:36:07.167]  So we're already in economic fraud.
[00:36:07.187 --> 00:36:08.668]  We're already in economic bondage.
[00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:15.267]  And these global banks openly fund Agenda 21 in a post-industrial world.
[00:36:15.528 --> 00:36:18.070]  They openly fund the shutdown of the U.S.
[00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.552]  and tax incentives to move what's left of industry and business offshore.
[00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:27.217]  And to raise our taxes while lowering them in zones they control 100% like Communist China.
[00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:34.208]  By the way, I've got an article here about China's parliament unveils dissident detention powers.
[00:36:34.308 --> 00:36:42.732]  Secret arrest, secret detention, modeled after the NDAA, and it's being decried by Reuters and international groups.
[00:36:42.972 --> 00:36:45.554]  But see, there's no moral high ground anymore.
[00:36:46.254 --> 00:36:53.298]  America wants the image of liberty and freedom in the example, not perfect, but still the best there was, is now the example.
[00:36:55.157 --> 00:37:08.064]  In obesity, and cancer, and porn, and death, and illiteracy, and evil, and war, and torture, and secret arrest, and every form of degeneracy you can imagine.
[00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:10.525]  Now, continuing here.
[00:37:13.547 --> 00:37:15.428]  This is the gauntlet being thrown down.
[00:37:15.508 --> 00:37:16.429]  What is the gauntlet?
[00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:20.351]  If you go back thousands of years, even to the beginnings of the Byzantine Empire,
[00:37:22.099 --> 00:37:25.521]  And then you go through what Spain and Portugal today and other areas.
[00:37:26.782 --> 00:37:34.467]  Many times, your armies, your city-states wouldn't want to kill each other because that would make you internally weak.
[00:37:34.507 --> 00:37:39.550]  Say in the case, in the true story of El Cid, great film based on real history.
[00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.992]  Suggest everyone watches it with Charlton Heston.
[00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.434]  And the Moors are invading.
[00:37:45.114 --> 00:37:52.217]  And at that weak point, one of the other city-states in Spain, what's Spain today, comes in and says, you will give us this city.
[00:37:52.277 --> 00:37:55.418]  And the king says, ancestrally, we've had this city for hundreds of years.
[00:37:56.138 --> 00:37:59.820]  And he says, fine, I will meet you with our armies on the field of battle here.
[00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:05.142]  And the king says, let us not do this while our enemies are invading.
[00:38:05.202 --> 00:38:07.603]  I know you've done this, thinking I'll just get into you right now.
[00:38:07.963 --> 00:38:09.604]  Let it be decided by a champion.
[00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:20.193]  And very well, take your glove off, throw it down, boom, the challenge is on.
[00:38:20.713 --> 00:38:22.275]  And it cannot be refused.
[00:38:24.898 --> 00:38:30.624]  Now, let me tell you what the brass did, lined up behind Panetta, watching this video.
[00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:33.327]  It's up at Infowars.com and in our articles on this subject.
[00:38:34.028 --> 00:38:35.750]  They took the gauntlet.
[00:38:38.996 --> 00:38:41.398]  And they just threw it down in front of Congress.
[00:38:41.738 --> 00:38:45.141]  And I watched over and over again the body language of those generals.
[00:38:45.882 --> 00:38:53.108]  They had slit eyes like wolves, staring at those senators with total contempt.
[00:38:55.189 --> 00:39:02.475]  And Panetta sat there in a very friendly but mafioso way, just going, no.
[00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:03.997]  They'd say, but Congress.
[00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:07.532]  Officers are commissioned by Congress.
[00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:08.353]  We hold the purse.
[00:39:08.413 --> 00:39:09.313]  We hold the war powers.
[00:39:09.353 --> 00:39:10.274]  It's the Constitution.
[00:39:10.534 --> 00:39:12.495]  And Panetta says, no, UN and NATO.
[00:39:13.356 --> 00:39:14.797]  And the senators are like, what?
[00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:25.604]  But see what happened last year when Obama said, I'm launching this war against Libya, but it's not a war.
[00:39:25.984 --> 00:39:27.706]  They said, but you got to get congressional authorization.
[00:39:27.986 --> 00:39:30.127]  He said, no, I don't need it.
[00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:31.768]  I get it from the UN.
[00:39:32.149 --> 00:39:35.611]  He didn't say the president can do this because the president can't.
[00:39:42.188 --> 00:39:47.171]  He said, I can do it because the UN gives me the authority.
[00:39:47.371 --> 00:39:51.653]  Paul Watson's article at InfoWars.com, the most important article we've ever put out.
[00:39:51.673 --> 00:39:56.336]  And we're going to have more on this subject.
[00:39:57.117 --> 00:40:02.460]  Has the links to the White House press releases where he says, I do this for the credibility of the UN.
[00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:08.128]  He does this as a lawyer, as a constitutional lawyer, to say there is no constitution.
[00:40:08.168 --> 00:40:09.509]  The U.N.
[00:40:09.729 --> 00:40:17.331]  commands the American president, who created the U.N., Rockefeller Carnegie Foundation, right here in the U.S., the Pentagon, intimately involved.
[00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:20.212]  Not for America, even, as some tool of control.
[00:40:20.372 --> 00:40:21.153]  That'd be bad enough.
[00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:28.415]  But as a thing to transfer the powers of the Republican to, and then incrementally build it out and train everybody.
[00:40:29.551 --> 00:40:30.091]  To accept it.
[00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:34.174]  And now they're to the point, they've got blackmail files on all these Senators and House members.
[00:40:34.514 --> 00:40:36.455]  Hit teams ready to kill those they don't control.
[00:40:36.475 --> 00:40:38.016]  That they don't have dirt on.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:47.246]  And they walk in there and they say, we're going to launch a war in Syria and it doesn't matter what you say or do.
[00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:52.651]  And the senators are like, just like they were eight, nine months ago in Libya, they're like, well, we'd like to authorize it.
[00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:55.173]  You know, we're military industrial complex funded.
[00:40:55.193 --> 00:40:56.614]  We're, we're all for doing this.
[00:40:56.634 --> 00:40:57.995]  It's just, you got to get authority from us.
[00:40:58.295 --> 00:40:59.176]  And they go, no, we don't.
[00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:01.478]  We get it from the UN and NATO.
[00:41:01.498 --> 00:41:07.123]  And the senators are like, but that's, that's unconstitutional.
[00:41:08.396 --> 00:41:09.796]  It's not just unconstitutional.
[00:41:10.577 --> 00:41:17.799]  It's treason and treachery and a dictatorial Caesar-esque power grab directly out of a textbook.
[00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:27.642]  Directly out of Episode 3 Star Wars, which is based on the Roman Senate from history, when Emperor Palpatine takes over.
[00:41:28.122 --> 00:41:29.342]  And they come to arrest him.
[00:41:29.382 --> 00:41:32.643]  They say, you're taking on all the powers of the Senate as a dictator.
[00:41:32.663 --> 00:41:33.343]  You're under arrest.
[00:41:33.363 --> 00:41:35.104]  And he goes, it's treason then.
[00:41:37.025 --> 00:41:38.627]  And they go, but the Senate won't stand for this.
[00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:40.148]  I am the Senate.
[00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:41.990]  That's what Caesar said.
[00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.334]  This is beyond... In fact, he said, I am the Senate once he took over.
[00:41:46.815 --> 00:41:48.356]  They said, but we're just a rubber stamp now.
[00:41:48.597 --> 00:41:52.661]  Well, I'll keep you around as a debating club, but I make the ultimate decisions.
[00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.322]  I am the Senate.
[00:41:55.063 --> 00:41:57.605]  He said other things like, I came, I saw, I conquered.
[00:41:59.007 --> 00:42:00.869]  Hillary said the same thing about Libya.
[00:42:02.352 --> 00:42:08.516]  Laughed about it, a soft little goblin-like woman, dominating the Republic, using us to carry out all these crimes.
[00:42:08.856 --> 00:42:11.478]  She said, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:42:11.498 --> 00:42:16.141]  Speaking of Gaddafi, who made a deal with him and let the West come in and liberalized everything.
[00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:18.042]  Oh, you're out, Al-Qaeda's in.
[00:42:20.144 --> 00:42:26.008]  Do you understand that there's no Bill of Rights, there's no Constitution, there's no nothing under this?
[00:42:27.769 --> 00:42:29.470]  And a foreign power
[00:42:31.167 --> 00:42:44.637]  A foreign power, which is this globalist corporate central bank, global governance consortium, commands our president and our military.
[00:42:46.158 --> 00:42:48.020]  This is the minimum what I'm saying here.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.740]  Do you understand that?
[00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:57.387]  And at a certain fleshly human level, I don't like throwing the gauntlet right back down, but a challenge of this nature must be responded to.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.962]  Because every time a country does this, it goes downhill quickly.
[00:43:01.202 --> 00:43:04.344]  They will rob and steal and destroy every bedrock.
[00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:06.965]  Family, private property, religious freedom.
[00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:08.286]  Everything's gone, folks.
[00:43:08.506 --> 00:43:09.747]  And it's going to happen very quickly.
[00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:10.888]  Giant wars.
[00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:12.189]  Everything.
[00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:14.030]  Okay?
[00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:15.391]  If they get away with this...
[00:43:16.806 --> 00:43:21.208]  Now the good news is, there are a bunch of Senators and House members saying, start impeachment procedures.
[00:43:21.588 --> 00:43:22.229]  You've got a call.
[00:43:22.249 --> 00:43:27.671]  In fact, I meant to ask you guys before the show, because they got a bunch of numbers, but they alternate them to keep the public from knowing what to call.
[00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:33.654]  Check the latest toll-free and toll switch numbers for the House and Senate.
[00:43:34.334 --> 00:43:35.695]  Give them to me so I can have them the next time.
[00:43:35.715 --> 00:43:38.656]  But test them, because they don't change their numbers.
[00:43:38.676 --> 00:43:42.598]  They have like four or five variants that they rotate that are being answered whatever day.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.141]  We've got to put articles out.
[00:43:45.781 --> 00:43:47.342]  We've got to call for the military.
[00:43:47.963 --> 00:43:50.845]  I'm calling for the military, especially officers.
[00:43:50.885 --> 00:43:55.748]  I don't care if you're a master sergeant or if you're a commissioned officer, you know, a colonel.
[00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:59.471]  This is the time to write letters to the president and to the editor.
[00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:01.132]  This is the time.
[00:44:01.152 --> 00:44:11.699]  I mean, you'll charge machine gun nests and fly in, you know, unmaintained helicopters and aircrafts and do all this and carry packs 40 miles and live off the land for a month.
[00:44:12.762 --> 00:44:14.143]  You know, to be in special forces.
[00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:15.165]  And I know you're good people.
[00:44:15.205 --> 00:44:15.805]  You'll do all this.
[00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:18.168]  Do you have the moral courage that I have?
[00:44:19.129 --> 00:44:21.711]  Some soft person?
[00:44:23.021 --> 00:44:24.041]  To risk your name?
[00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:25.602]  Yeah, they may try to court-martial you.
[00:44:25.862 --> 00:44:27.002]  They may try to arrest you.
[00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:28.543]  Probably not if enough of you come out.
[00:44:28.923 --> 00:44:30.723]  But I'm risking my life right now calling for this.
[00:44:31.123 --> 00:44:32.124]  But it's what's got to be done.
[00:44:32.744 --> 00:44:36.825]  All military that are not treasonous traitors to this foreign takeover.
[00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:38.486]  This war against the Republic.
[00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:42.727]  And you got Congress people coming out saying this is illegal and Obama should be impeached.
[00:44:43.187 --> 00:44:49.609]  Folks, he should be impeached if he said he had the power to wage war and probably arrested.
[00:44:49.669 --> 00:44:52.230]  But the fact that he says it's for a foreign consortium?
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:45:03.985]  You never give the President the power to launch wars or anything on his own because a foreign group could pay him off, or blackmail them, or they could have been brought here and raised as agents.
[00:45:04.726 --> 00:45:05.866]  Our founders dealt with this.
[00:45:06.006 --> 00:45:07.507]  Europe always dealt with this.
[00:45:07.847 --> 00:45:11.369]  Our founders were historians who spoke four or five languages.
[00:45:11.609 --> 00:45:13.590]  They wrote this to protect us from this.
[00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.851]  It's happening.
[00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:16.672]  It happens everywhere else.
[00:45:19.449 --> 00:45:30.611]  Our criminal, illegitimate government now gives aid and comfort to the Communist Chinese as they pass an NDAA identical to what our Congress and Obama signed.
[00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:44.774]  And look, they have contempt for the Congress because they know they're a bunch of little traitorous creatures as well, who would give the President the power to secretly arrest and wage war anywhere in the world, including against citizens domestically.
[00:45:46.994 --> 00:46:01.640]  I mean, Congress, you gave him this power, which is illegitimate, but nevertheless you did, which was a conviction of all of you that voted for it, hundreds didn't, and is a conviction by their own hand and their own statements of the executive.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.761]  This is not the U.S.
[00:46:03.801 --> 00:46:04.181]  government.
[00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:10.924]  Just as Encyclopedia Britannica says, the moment Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his forces, he became a traitor?
[00:46:11.997 --> 00:46:15.299]  And an enemy of the Roman Republic and was waging war against the Republic.
[00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:18.241]  The Republic is collapsing.
[00:46:19.021 --> 00:46:30.728]  Right now, this is, this, you could mark this as, as the New World Order firing 357 rounds directly into the chest of this country.
[00:46:31.249 --> 00:46:38.093]  And if we don't put the Republic in the hospital right now and get surgery going right now, this just shows us how sick we already were.
[00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:41.750]  And I'm going to put this in an article.
[00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:47.214]  It is time for military officers to speak out, which is not even... That's all you can do.
[00:46:47.594 --> 00:46:48.214]  Read your oath.
[00:46:49.936 --> 00:46:51.156]  Read what you were charged with.
[00:46:51.216 --> 00:46:57.581]  I mean, it absolutely says that you will follow the Constitution and that you swear an oath to the Constitution.
[00:46:59.292 --> 00:47:01.134]  And of the Commander-in-Chief in time of war.
[00:47:01.754 --> 00:47:10.061]  When they declare the war, when the Congress who funds it and runs it and approves the... Why doesn't the President pick his generals?
[00:47:10.822 --> 00:47:11.582]  Why does Congress?
[00:47:14.124 --> 00:47:15.926]  Why do officers have to be approved?
[00:47:17.087 --> 00:47:20.310]  And have letters of recommendation that your family's been here a long time.
[00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:26.355]  Folks, you couldn't become an officer in the first 150 years of this country once it got started if your family hadn't been here forever.
[00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:33.094]  You weren't even trusted to be an officer if your family didn't get here in the first few boatloads!
[00:47:34.915 --> 00:47:36.776]  Now look at what we've turned into!
[00:47:38.136 --> 00:47:39.337]  Now look what we've become!
[00:47:39.397 --> 00:47:40.277]  It's pathetic!
[00:47:42.096 --> 00:47:55.710]  You've got these criminal gangsters who've stolen tens of trillions of dollars, and all the corruption, and shipping guns to Mexico, waddling in, slapping the Congress in the face, going, listen here, Mac, you don't run jack squat.
[00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.613]  And the Senators are all like old peacocks, fluffing up, getting angry.
[00:48:00.194 --> 00:48:06.020]  But I'm sure they're, again, the globalists wouldn't have made this move if they didn't know that they think they have that House and that Senate.
[00:48:07.697 --> 00:48:09.138]  Saying we're going to launch wars.
[00:48:09.238 --> 00:48:13.221]  I told you folks that when they got away with that Libya war without congressional approval, the sky was the limit.
[00:48:13.261 --> 00:48:13.921]  And now look at it.
[00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:28.312]  The minimum that the military can do, and the police and all of you that claim you've sworn an oath to that constitution, the minimum you can do is put out public letters, shoot YouTube videos,
[00:48:30.905 --> 00:48:46.635]  I mean, if I was a military officer, I would have the troops form up in front of me, and I would read them the Constitution, and I'd read them what Congressman Jones has said, and I would play them that video, and then go, look, the Congress is in charge, you know this, you see what's happening.
[00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:49.657]  I'd read them out of the Encyclopedia Britannica about Julius Caesar.
[00:48:51.141 --> 00:49:10.910]  And I would march down to the headquarters and say, why is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the other generals in there, like a bunch of gangsters, telling Congress that they no longer have any authority over military actions, and that not the President, again, that would be treason and dictatorship, and Julius, no, no, no, it's worse than Julius Caesar.
[00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.551]  Julius Caesar was a patriot compared to this.
[00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:18.633]  No!
[00:49:18.953 --> 00:49:21.174]  I mean, I am getting chilled after chill right now.
[00:49:21.954 --> 00:49:23.974]  Probably because I know I'm risking my life doing this, but whatever.
[00:49:24.034 --> 00:49:28.095]  I mean, who's somebody's got to stand up to the emperor being butt naked here?
[00:49:28.935 --> 00:49:30.336]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[00:49:31.916 --> 00:49:32.856]  Wait till I play the clips.
[00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:34.456]  I mean, they're up at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:34.816 --> 00:49:38.617]  Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking Panetta testimony.
[00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:41.898]  The United States is seeking control of its affairs, international bureaucrats.
[00:49:42.498 --> 00:49:46.679]  And even in their comment, they go, oh, it's misinterpreted, but we do get our authority from foreign groups.
[00:49:48.206 --> 00:49:48.967]  So it's a PSYOP.
[00:49:49.007 --> 00:49:50.508]  We want world government, but it doesn't exist.
[00:49:51.388 --> 00:50:01.856]  And then we've got all the quotes in the video and the article, but I'm calling on the military, officers of conscience, to speak out.
[00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:10.763]  And if they try to court-martial you, and call you in and you're saying, look, I have to go public here, Congress
[00:50:12.392 --> 00:50:18.236]  Is now not even being consulted on war when I swore an oath to this and Congress will get behind you.
[00:50:18.796 --> 00:50:20.397]  This is the Achilles heel of these guys.
[00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.178]  They've gone too far.
[00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:24.340]  There's already a bunch of Senators and House members saying begin impeachment.
[00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:29.483]  But if we just sit here and kind of get intimidated and, oh well, the military follows these orders.
[00:50:30.064 --> 00:50:33.046]  And listen, military, you heard Colonel Schaefer here two days ago.
[00:50:33.326 --> 00:50:35.107]  The guy that ran the Hunt-Bin Laden unit.
[00:50:35.628 --> 00:50:37.989]  A real patriot, special forces, everything.
[00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:40.491]  Saying no, this is treason, this is illegal.
[00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:42.530]  Treason?
[00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:43.611]  It's illegal.
[00:50:44.552 --> 00:50:45.753]  Time to start saying no.
[00:50:46.133 --> 00:50:51.798]  I'm here in front of God and everybody, three million people right now, saying, military, speak up.
[00:50:51.898 --> 00:50:53.099]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:50:53.499 --> 00:50:58.443]  Point out this is illegal and say that you are under Congress, except under declaration of war.
[00:50:59.324 --> 00:50:59.944]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:07.426]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:51:07.666 --> 00:51:25.090]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:31.292]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[00:51:31.492 --> 00:51:39.254]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:42.635]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[00:51:43.055 --> 00:51:45.597]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:51:45.837 --> 00:51:46.878]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:51:47.098 --> 00:51:47.839]  It's incredible.

[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.342]  We all know the importance of having storable foods.
[00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:04.402]  But what about when the food runs out?
[00:53:04.823 --> 00:53:05.223]  What then?
[00:53:06.701 --> 00:53:09.723]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:54:11.553 --> 00:54:11.974]  All right.
[00:54:13.236 --> 00:54:15.641]  I'm going to give the number out for military.
[00:54:17.945 --> 00:54:19.368]  Active duty, enlisted.
[00:54:20.427 --> 00:54:25.291]  Non-commissioned officers, officers, I want to hear from you because I know I'm right.
[00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:27.632]  I've had endless congressional scholars on.
[00:54:27.653 --> 00:54:34.998]  I had congressional scholar and advisor and former federal regulator Bruce Fine on.
[00:54:35.078 --> 00:54:38.841]  He said this is treason, this is takeover, the Libya situation.
[00:54:39.762 --> 00:54:42.484]  I've had Colonel Schaefer on saying it's treason, it's illegal.
[00:54:43.044 --> 00:54:45.166]  I mean, he's still in the military saying this is treason.
[00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:47.580]  But it's worse than treason.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.681]  It's espionage.
[00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.884]  It's treason if you're an American and do this to your country.
[00:54:52.825 --> 00:54:58.031]  It's beyond treason when you do it for a foreign power, and it is mind-blowing.
[00:54:59.192 --> 00:55:00.033]  I'm gonna play the clips.
[00:55:01.061 --> 00:55:03.242]  Next hour, the video's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:03.282 --> 00:55:11.164]  It's a seven-and-a-half minute clip of Senator Sessions going, well, you've got to get approval from us to be involved in military operations against countries.
[00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:12.384]  And they go, no, we don't.
[00:55:12.404 --> 00:55:13.485]  We get that from NATO and the UN.
[00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:15.325]  He goes, but Congress does that.
[00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.165]  The Constitution says that.
[00:55:16.185 --> 00:55:18.346]  And they go, we now follow the United Nations.
[00:55:22.031 --> 00:55:25.715]  I mean, you can go watch the video, go read the quotes, and it goes on and on.
[00:55:25.735 --> 00:55:37.266]  The senators start going, wait a minute, you know Congress funds you, and we commission the officers, and the brass are looking at them like they're the enemy.
[00:55:38.687 --> 00:55:44.413]  I've never seen, and I've watched hundreds of these hearings, I've never seen the generals act so criminal.
[00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:51.075]  I mean, we had the last Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman saying no to this just a couple years ago.
[00:55:51.655 --> 00:55:53.517]  I mean, I've never seen them behave like this.
[00:55:53.557 --> 00:55:55.579]  They have really gotten a crew of crooks.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.224]  They are arresting journalists by the hundreds, and it's just a minor footnote.
[00:56:00.344 --> 00:56:03.087]  Oh, you talked to a whistleblower on government corruption, you're going to jail.
[00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:08.892]  I got Wired Magazine, the feds are announcing they'll take any dot-com they want and seize it anytime.
[00:56:09.612 --> 00:56:11.794]  Because they control the register outside of courts.
[00:56:12.554 --> 00:56:17.057]  Even for political reasons, they're erasing videos critical of the government on YouTube.
[00:56:17.978 --> 00:56:20.259]  I'm getting lots of lavish death threats.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.461]  That my time's coming.
[00:56:24.922 --> 00:56:28.104]  The state police in Austin are calling up my affiliate trying to get me off the air.
[00:56:29.332 --> 00:56:32.533]  Because the green light's been given, it's time to butcher America.
[00:56:33.173 --> 00:56:43.034]  Well, I hope all of you that serve evil understand that the horrible country you're going to turn this into, you did it, idiots, for a bunch of globalists that sit offshore who've always hated this country.
[00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:51.276]  Thanks a lot for killing America and wrapping all your treason in the American flag.
[00:56:51.296 --> 00:56:52.416]  You make me want to throw up.
[00:56:53.756 --> 00:56:57.157]  But there are those of us that know this was once a great republic, and it will rise again.
[00:56:58.365 --> 00:56:58.908]  Just know that.
[00:57:00.073 --> 00:57:01.138]  They've already killed the country.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:02.423]  They've already butchered it.
[00:57:02.463 --> 00:57:03.347]  We're dead already.
[00:57:04.482 --> 00:57:13.970]  They use the analogy of Star Trek, Rathacon, where Spock goes in to fix the reactor, and Captain Kirk tries to go in, and the Dr. Bone says, he's dead already.
[00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:14.991]  You're not going to save him.
[00:57:15.672 --> 00:57:19.395]  But you see, a country is a spirit and an idea, so it can be resurrected.
[00:57:19.695 --> 00:57:21.056]  But we're walking dead.
[00:57:21.297 --> 00:57:24.199]  The Republic is basically collapsing right now.
[00:57:24.459 --> 00:57:25.540]  It's already hit its knees.
[00:57:25.881 --> 00:57:26.922]  There's thousands of cuts.
[00:57:27.362 --> 00:57:29.464]  But these stabs are so deep.
[00:57:31.528 --> 00:57:37.090]  And the contempt before the Senate going, no, we don't come to you for wars anymore.
[00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.271]  Obama put a letter out last year and launched a war!
[00:57:42.531 --> 00:57:44.392]  I'm going to give you the number to the switchboard.
[00:57:44.532 --> 00:57:47.893]  Everybody needs to call Congress and say, what is it going to take?
[00:57:47.973 --> 00:57:49.073]  Start impeachment now.
[00:57:49.233 --> 00:57:50.073]  This is treason.
[00:57:50.093 --> 00:57:51.514]  202-224-3121.
[00:57:51.554 --> 00:57:52.294]  No one is safe.
[00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:58.727]  Nothing is safe.
[00:57:58.747 --> 00:57:58.727]  202, 224, 3121.
[00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:01.008]  Due process.
[00:58:01.488 --> 00:58:01.988]  Our country.
[00:58:02.068 --> 00:58:02.409]  Everything.
[00:58:02.609 --> 00:58:04.470]  This is foreign corporate invaders.
[00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.971]  This is tyranny by lawyers.
[00:58:06.811 --> 00:58:18.337]  Where they come in, set up structures, start transferring power, money, and influence, and then now they're just fully transferring it and going, not only we don't need a declaration of war or even an authorization, you don't run anything.
[00:58:19.438 --> 00:58:21.599]  Kind of like the feds have told the states they have no authority.
[00:58:21.779 --> 00:58:25.061]  Well see now, the federal government's being told it has no authority.
[00:58:26.266 --> 00:58:30.208]  It's all the UN and NATO run by private central banks.
[00:58:30.668 --> 00:58:31.629]  See how that works?
[00:58:31.649 --> 00:58:33.970]  202-224-3121.
[00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:37.151]  I'll give you the number for the military to call in in just a moment.
[00:58:37.171 --> 00:58:46.876]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.663 --> 00:58:51.683]  I had tried everything.
[00:58:51.743 --> 00:58:53.884]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:58:54.084 --> 00:58:56.784]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:58:57.224 --> 00:59:01.685]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:59:02.045 --> 00:59:08.427]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:59:08.907 --> 00:59:19.349]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:24.250]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.

[00:59:53.246 --> 00:59:55.167]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.647 --> 00:59:58.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.953 --> 01:00:05.613]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.254 --> 01:00:07.314]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.035 --> 01:00:09.215]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.796 --> 01:00:10.616]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.377 --> 01:00:13.278]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:16.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.183]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:30.854]  Okay, we're at Breitbart.com, and I'm going to cover this more after the break, but here's the article.
[01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:35.718]  Panetta, international permission, Trump's congressional permission for military actions.
[01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:41.863]  Actually, I'm not criticizing Breitbart's site, but that's not even as bad as the quotes are.
[01:00:42.144 --> 01:00:46.748]  They say Congress has nothing to do with it, and it's international permission is where they get the authority.
[01:00:47.328 --> 01:00:49.029]  This isn't Obama saying I'm a dictator.
[01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.511]  He says the UN's my boss.
[01:00:51.297 --> 01:00:59.019]  Now, there are 850 comments on this, and there are similar comments at InfoWars.com, but we're crawling with COINTELPRO and people, you know, trying to cause infighting.
[01:00:59.919 --> 01:01:02.420]  But here it is.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:02.940]  850 comments.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.821]  During breaks, I've gone through about 100 of these.
[01:01:05.141 --> 01:01:06.261]  Almost every one of them.
[01:01:07.241 --> 01:01:08.342]  Let me scroll down a little bit there.
[01:01:09.842 --> 01:01:11.963]  Says, Panetta needs to be arrested immediately.
[01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:18.545]  He has breached his responsibility to our Constitution and is a direct threat to the nation, as any terrorist.
[01:01:18.565 --> 01:01:19.425]  This man is a criminal.
[01:01:20.307 --> 01:01:21.088]  Death to tyrants.
[01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:26.673]  That's an old saying going back to Rome and the founding fathers.
[01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:28.675]  So are the rest of his administration.
[01:01:28.695 --> 01:01:31.819]  The entire administration is a bunch of traitors and enemies of this country.
[01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:32.880]  I'm reading you quotes here.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.545]  How about our military that just sits there and lets us poor Americans pay and watch
[01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:40.772]  Our Constitution go up in flames.
[01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:42.113]  How about you get up and speak out?
[01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:43.213]  I guess you are.
[01:01:43.894 --> 01:01:45.155]  I cannot believe that I'm reading this.
[01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:47.356]  For the record, I'm an active duty officer.
[01:01:47.456 --> 01:01:47.796]  Look at this.
[01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:55.381]  Number one, Leon Panetta was telling the senior senator, a senator, that Congress has absolutely no voice.
[01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:55.781]  That's right.
[01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:56.722]  See, the headline's wrong.
[01:01:57.242 --> 01:01:59.944]  We don't need an article saying they tell them you have no voice.
[01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:00.664]  That's what they say.
[01:02:01.144 --> 01:02:02.305]  This officer gets what they say.
[01:02:02.365 --> 01:02:03.246]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:08.158]  They're not even playing patty cake with the little idiot senators anymore who have been already engaged in treason.
[01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:09.459]  They're all involved too!
[01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:10.840]  What do they expect is going to happen?
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.161]  Where do they think this road leads?
[01:02:14.403 --> 01:02:15.824]  Senators were actually having to catch their breath.
[01:02:15.864 --> 01:02:18.786]  This is so amazing and it's not even a news issue.
[01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:28.914]  Number one, Leon Panetta was telling the senator that Congress has absolutely no voice in the president choosing to go to war.
[01:02:29.334 --> 01:02:32.697]  Congress has a voice in sustaining a war, not initiating one.
[01:02:33.493 --> 01:02:37.334]  Point being, the Barack Obama can choose just like Bush to go to war without Congressional approval.
[01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:40.335]  See, this poor officer doesn't understand that that wasn't even before.
[01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.115]  That was how they told them all that.
[01:02:42.475 --> 01:02:43.716]  Congress has to direct it.
[01:02:44.296 --> 01:02:49.477]  Now, Congress passed laws that if we were attacked suddenly, the President could respond in those circumstances.
[01:02:50.438 --> 01:02:51.778]  But that's still Congressional control.
[01:02:52.398 --> 01:02:58.040]  If we are to stay in active combat over a period of time, I believe 90 days, Congress has to approve further operations.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.080]  Yeah, that's the War Powers Act.
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:03.134]  This is as important as Leon Panetta is the President's liaison for combat.
[01:03:03.475 --> 01:03:07.661]  If Leon Panetta says we need to unilaterally go to war with Syria, Obama can say go.
[01:03:08.282 --> 01:03:11.848]  Mr. Sessions doesn't get a say, at least not at first.
[01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.230]  And then it goes on.
[01:03:16.857 --> 01:03:19.360]  So the military, that person's not fully understanding it.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.623]  Congress did give Bush approval for both Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:03:22.663 --> 01:03:23.164]  Look it up.
[01:03:23.184 --> 01:03:24.125]  So now they're explaining that.
[01:03:24.165 --> 01:03:24.605]  And they did.
[01:03:25.246 --> 01:03:26.708]  But it wasn't a proper declaration.
[01:03:26.748 --> 01:03:29.671]  People argued, well now they won't even get an authorization.
[01:03:29.711 --> 01:03:30.392]  Now that's happening.
[01:03:32.534 --> 01:03:37.900]  And then it goes on here with people saying, you know, the Constitution's being shredded before our eyes.
[01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:47.669]  It goes on to say the top brass of the military are just as corrupt as anyone in politics.
[01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:56.220]  It's all about power and prestige and most anyone above the rank of 08 looks only into ensuring their retirement and future in government.
[01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:02.030]  And it just goes on here.
[01:04:02.531 --> 01:04:10.234]  So forever they've tried to train people that, oh, the president can launch a war without congressional approval, which is total treason.
[01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.275]  Now they're saying, oh, he gets it from the UN.
[01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:16.116]  Read the Constitution.
[01:04:18.777 --> 01:04:23.539]  That's why whenever America was attacked in the past, you had to get a declaration of war.
[01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:28.882]  But then Korea, Vietnam, right through, it just became Gulf of Tonkin resolutions.
[01:04:29.838 --> 01:04:31.379]  A resolution of force.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.482]  And then the power started drifting to the President.
[01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:38.745]  And the globalists always wanted that, so the President could be a foreign puppet.
[01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:42.268]  And engaged in puppeteering our military.
[01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:44.209]  And this is it.
[01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:52.256]  So now, they're going to teach the military, not only does the President launch wars without Congress, or the wise are even a Congress, now it's the President launches it because the UN's our boss.
[01:04:53.137 --> 01:04:57.200]  And you're going to see the military come out, the brass, and say, that's right, we just saw it in Congress.
[01:05:00.649 --> 01:05:06.074]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.295 --> 01:05:12.079]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.459 --> 01:05:27.552]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.523]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:37.326]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:05:38.086 --> 01:05:38.907]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:41.208]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:41.468 --> 01:05:42.970]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.812]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.132 --> 01:05:52.396]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:05:55.478 --> 01:05:57.500]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.701]  Others don't.
[01:06:01.004 --> 01:06:02.506]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:07.751]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:09.392]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:09.573 --> 01:06:18.361]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:19.082 --> 01:06:26.187]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:26.627 --> 01:06:34.232]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:39.535]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:06.563]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:24.431]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:07:24.691 --> 01:07:28.793]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:07:29.073 --> 01:07:30.654]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:07:30.854 --> 01:07:38.700]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:07:45.324 --> 01:07:46.385]  Check it out for yourself.

[01:08:00.674 --> 01:08:06.315]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.836 --> 01:08:12.917]  Ladies and gentlemen, I struggle for the proper words to describe what's happening.
[01:08:14.198 --> 01:08:28.462]  If you just joined us, multiple Senators and House members like Representative Jones have come out and said that this is unconstitutional, that it violates the Constitution,
[01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:34.717]  And that it's a usurpation of our Republic and an impeachable offense.
[01:08:34.817 --> 01:08:37.558]  It goes beyond an impeachable offense.
[01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:41.559]  It is a treacherous war against our Republic.
[01:08:42.179 --> 01:08:57.123]  I was reading from the Encyclopedia Britannica earlier on crossing the Rubicon by Julius Caesar, that it was an act of war prescribed in Latin as coup d'etat.
[01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:06.627]  When he declared that he was over the military forces of the city-state that ruled the empire.
[01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:13.195]  That was January 10th, 49 B.C.
[01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:17.460]  Now last year, and I have the date here in the article by Paul Joseph Watson,
[01:09:18.772 --> 01:09:27.634]  Obama sent a letter to Congress when they said you have to get approval, and he said, you can read it, you can read the letter, link to it right here, on InfoWars.com, on WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:35.836]  He said, I don't need congressional approval, you don't have authority over the presidency, I get my authority from the United Nations.
[01:09:37.576 --> 01:09:40.877]  And members of the House sued him over it, 10 members.
[01:09:43.577 --> 01:09:45.578]  This is a coup d'etat.
[01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:54.968]  And the brass came in, and the Secretary of Defense came in, and they said international permission is where we get our authority.
[01:09:54.988 --> 01:09:57.190]  They didn't just say the President is a dictator.
[01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:01.692]  They didn't just say that.
[01:10:05.629 --> 01:10:09.912]  They said, we get it from the United Nations.
[01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:15.675]  Now, I want to hear from active duty, National Guard, Marines, Army, but I really want to hear from officers.
[01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:22.079]  And by the way, I'm online on big news sites that are starting to report this, where they're like, oh, there's a battle between Congress and the President.
[01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:24.400]  It's a political debate about who runs the military.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.661]  If there's no debate,
[01:10:26.772 --> 01:10:35.257]  And I'm seeing the comments going, I'm an army officer, I'm an army captain, I'm a Marine Corps colonel, and I'm telling you this is illegal.
[01:10:35.477 --> 01:10:37.518]  Let me read to you what Congressman Jones said.
[01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:42.721]  We're going to go to Paul Watson and then the military calling in the toll-free number for active duty.
[01:10:43.002 --> 01:10:44.322]  What do you think we should do about this?
[01:10:44.703 --> 01:10:49.826]  This is an open coup against America, like we're some third world country, but it's a bunch of lawyers going, oh,
[01:10:51.838 --> 01:10:53.460]  It's not the military seizing the Congress.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.344]  They just walk in and say, oh, we now just do whatever the UN says in NATO.
[01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:02.268]  And the senator's like, I'm having trouble catching my breath.
[01:11:02.328 --> 01:11:04.030]  I mean, the senators are actually going, huh?
[01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:11.016]  Because they know these wars were launched last year without approval that's illegal and treason, but now they're being told it's for the UN.
[01:11:12.338 --> 01:11:12.918]  And they're going, huh?
[01:11:14.628 --> 01:11:21.615]  Let me catch my breath here, because I was watching this this morning, I didn't see this last night, and I had trouble talking.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:34.528]  And I guess for the average American that only cares about whatever football game or basketball game's on, I guess I am bad, because I'm like, oh, you don't want the UN running the military?
[01:11:34.568 --> 01:11:35.229]  It's no big deal.
[01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:52.012]  I've been to so many urban warfare drills where they've got our troops trained with foreign troops for operations here in America and now they admit they'll use troops from 15 nations here and only 09 other documents to deal with quote civil insurrection and political dissonance
[01:11:55.029 --> 01:11:58.071]  FEMA is hiring internment specialists for the U.S.
[01:11:58.131 --> 01:11:59.032]  for political dissidents.
[01:11:59.332 --> 01:12:00.392]  It's all admitted.
[01:12:00.873 --> 01:12:02.274]  And this is like a minor footnote.
[01:12:02.294 --> 01:12:08.858]  I've got the New York Times today going, there's a little fight between the legislative and executive about who runs wars.
[01:12:08.918 --> 01:12:09.518]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:09.699 --> 01:12:10.879]  There's not a fight about that.
[01:12:10.939 --> 01:12:12.560]  That was settled when the country was founded.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.121]  It's Congress.
[01:12:13.641 --> 01:12:14.462]  This is beyond that.
[01:12:14.642 --> 01:12:18.605]  They're saying the UN and NATO call the shots.
[01:12:18.966 --> 01:12:19.846]  Do you understand?
[01:12:19.886 --> 01:12:24.150]  It's like Michael News saying, you know, 15 years ago, why am I under UN command over here?
[01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:26.472]  Why is a UN officer commanding me?
[01:12:27.493 --> 01:12:28.313]  It was fundamental.
[01:12:28.714 --> 01:12:30.795]  People are like, oh, whatever, let the UN command you.
[01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:35.920]  Now you see where it leads and everything they've done is to get us ready for this.
[01:12:37.435 --> 01:12:39.620]  Folks, if they can do this, they can do anything.
[01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:44.651]  That's why courts are ruling they can come in your house without warrants, download your cell phone without warrants.
[01:12:44.691 --> 01:12:45.614]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:51.772]  The toll-free number to join us for military personnel out there.
[01:12:51.892 --> 01:12:53.153]  I want to hear what you have to say to this.
[01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:54.534]  I mean, you've got to speak out.
[01:12:54.554 --> 01:12:55.394]  You've got to write letters.
[01:12:55.594 --> 01:12:56.755]  You've got to shoot YouTube videos.
[01:12:56.775 --> 01:12:57.576]  You've got to go public.
[01:12:57.756 --> 01:12:58.476]  You've got to march.
[01:12:58.777 --> 01:13:00.698]  Your country is under attack from within.
[01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:02.339]  Enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:06.282]  Our republic is openly, they're declaring it.
[01:13:06.322 --> 01:13:10.945]  It already happened, but now they're declaring the UN gives the president orders.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.501]  Go read the quotes on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:16.421]  Go watch the video.
[01:13:16.461 --> 01:13:17.741]  I'm going to play it after I take calls.
[01:13:24.624 --> 01:13:25.204]  Breaking news.
[01:13:25.244 --> 01:13:27.524]  Representative Jones puts Obama on notice.
[01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:32.046]  Walter Jones, Congress, North Carolina 3rd District.
[01:13:33.046 --> 01:13:35.027]  In the House of Representatives, this is from his website.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:43.083]  Mr. Jones submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the committee on the judiciary.
[01:13:43.103 --> 01:13:47.005]  In fact, guys, dig this bill up for me.
[01:13:47.986 --> 01:13:49.607]  Chris has got it, put it on screen for folks.
[01:13:50.267 --> 01:13:51.067]  It's the 112th Congress, 2011-2012, h.com.res.107ih.
[01:13:59.514 --> 01:14:02.036]  This is like defibrillators on the heart of the Republic.
[01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:03.837]  It's in cardiac arrest.
[01:14:04.017 --> 01:14:04.658]  Get them in there.
[01:14:05.158 --> 01:14:06.379]  The military speaking out.
[01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:07.360]  That's your duty.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:13.764]  The Republic, the Constitution, is being openly stomped and desecrated in front of you.
[01:14:14.805 --> 01:14:16.026]  You've got to say no.
[01:14:16.106 --> 01:14:16.726]  This is it.
[01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:25.272]  And the reason we speak out now, we've known this has been happening for a while, but now it's so brazen it's actually got Congress out of their coma for five seconds.
[01:14:26.413 --> 01:14:27.254]  Now let me read to you what
[01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:33.570]  Congressman Walter Jones said, I think he was on a few years ago.
[01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:45.032]  Concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the use of offensive military force by the President without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress constitute an impeachable high crime.
[01:14:45.052 --> 01:14:47.093]  High crime folks, you know what a high crime is?
[01:14:48.273 --> 01:14:49.413]  You know what they do with a high crime?
[01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:51.634]  You know what they do for treason?
[01:14:53.172 --> 01:14:54.693]  This is from the House member.
[01:14:55.373 --> 01:14:56.454]  Hope his plane doesn't blow up.
[01:14:56.474 --> 01:14:58.215]  Hope he doesn't slip on a banana peel.
[01:14:59.015 --> 01:15:00.556]  We've all got to stand up together.
[01:15:00.656 --> 01:15:01.156]  I'm doing it.
[01:15:01.637 --> 01:15:02.537]  Jones is doing it.
[01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:06.980]  Is it only the Joneses around here and the Pauls around here that are men?
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.681]  Where are you, military?
[01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:11.802]  Where are you when the country is going to hell in a handbasket?
[01:15:12.823 --> 01:15:14.504]  You better believe I'm risking my life right now.
[01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:32.855]  Expressing the sense of the Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime of misdemeanor under Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S.
[01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:33.556]  Constitution!
[01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:38.819]  Whereas all these military, I see debating on the sites whether or not they can do this.
[01:15:39.059 --> 01:15:41.661]  This isn't even about the President launching an attack if we're hit.
[01:15:41.941 --> 01:15:45.083]  Congress has given them that authority so they don't have to call Congress in.
[01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:47.970]  And people said that was dangerous, see where it leads.
[01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:52.231]  This is the President saying, I follow the UN and NATO.
[01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:53.872]  Okay?
[01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:55.813]  In fact, Jones doesn't even get it.
[01:15:56.633 --> 01:15:57.693]  It's worse than that.
[01:15:58.174 --> 01:16:00.334]  It's a foreign coup d'etat.
[01:16:00.614 --> 01:16:04.636]  That's why the President isn't allowed to do this stuff, because they could get an agent in.
[01:16:05.296 --> 01:16:06.076]  And they have!
[01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:08.697]  Oh, man.
[01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:12.439]  Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic,
[01:16:14.096 --> 01:16:18.218]  Is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war the cornerstone of the republic.
[01:16:18.238 --> 01:16:18.658]  That's right.
[01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:23.080]  The cornerstone of the republic.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.781]  The cornerstone.
[01:16:26.141 --> 01:16:27.642]  Founding fathers said that.
[01:16:28.202 --> 01:16:31.383]  And I'm reading Military Brass debating whether Obama can do this.
[01:16:31.563 --> 01:16:32.223]  How brainwashed.
[01:16:32.404 --> 01:16:35.105]  All you got to do is go read the Constitution, dummy.
[01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:37.025]  That you swore an oath to.
[01:16:37.045 --> 01:16:40.487]  The good news is most of the military is awake.
[01:16:41.776 --> 01:16:45.382]  9 out of 10 comments from the military I'm reading are just like totally awake.
[01:16:45.763 --> 01:16:51.373]  Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's inclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.
[01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:52.755]  Let me say that to the military again.
[01:16:54.209 --> 01:17:00.494]  The cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's inclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution.
[01:17:00.554 --> 01:17:07.540]  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, this Senate concurring, the Senate has now concurred with this.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.521]  Okay, there's a Senate bill.
[01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:09.522]  Senate's on board.
[01:17:09.922 --> 01:17:15.687]  This is the sense of Congress that accept in response to an actual or imminent attack, that's ICBMs coming in,
[01:17:16.227 --> 01:17:16.607]  And it goes on.
[01:17:16.627 --> 01:17:17.068]  NO DEBATING!
[01:17:17.088 --> 01:17:17.388]  NO DEBATING!
[01:17:42.942 --> 01:17:44.003]  No, no, no.
[01:17:44.203 --> 01:17:45.564]  There is no discussion.
[01:17:45.784 --> 01:17:48.166]  This is high treason and beyond.
[01:17:48.466 --> 01:17:49.347]  This is treachery.
[01:17:50.008 --> 01:17:52.530]  Because you can argue it's not treason if you're really a foreign agent.
[01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.350]  It's espionage.
[01:17:53.750 --> 01:18:02.477]  Obama, Panetta, the brass that goes along with this, are all guilty of espionage by the corporate crime syndicate, Mafia, known as the New World Order.
[01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:03.358]  And I've had it!
[01:18:04.038 --> 01:18:05.459]  I want our Republic back!
[01:18:05.719 --> 01:18:07.599]  If they get away with this, what do you think's next?
[01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:10.580]  Secret arrest of citizens, shutdown of free speech, all of it!
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.301]  And all the bondage that comes with it!
[01:18:12.481 --> 01:18:16.202]  And I've sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance to these people!
[01:18:17.223 --> 01:18:18.463]  You're like, why are you getting upset?
[01:18:18.943 --> 01:18:23.725]  You men get upset for these times, not for going to some football game and getting angry!
[01:18:25.746 --> 01:18:29.107]  I'm skipping this break because I got a bunch of military officers and others calling in right now.
[01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:36.583]  Current Marine, Army, former retired officers, but I wanna hear, we're gonna go to you, but I wanna bring Watson up here.
[01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:41.205]  Watson, this is just, same thing in England, where you're at.
[01:18:41.465 --> 01:18:46.046]  They've signed over your country's control to the EU, and now they've signed it over to private banks.
[01:18:46.286 --> 01:18:48.167]  This is coup d'etat by banker.
[01:18:48.667 --> 01:18:51.048]  Obama launches banker coup over US.
[01:18:51.108 --> 01:18:54.749]  I mean, that's not words, that's what it is, Watson!
[01:18:55.029 --> 01:18:56.150]  How incredible is this?
[01:18:58.396 --> 01:19:02.957]  Well, Alex, I think they're going to use it, even if they have a battle over it.
[01:19:03.037 --> 01:19:09.319]  And, you know, you win the right to not have the UN and NATO in control of U.S.
[01:19:09.379 --> 01:19:15.021]  affairs, and they're just going to use that battle to then attack Syria without the UN.
[01:19:15.921 --> 01:19:18.221]  So you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
[01:19:18.402 --> 01:19:18.902]  We are, Paul.
[01:19:18.922 --> 01:19:20.782]  We must have called... Did we call your cell phone?
[01:19:22.903 --> 01:19:23.743]  No, it's the house phone.
[01:19:25.181 --> 01:19:26.481]  I want to talk to you about this.
[01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:28.123]  I want to get you connected via Skype.
[01:19:28.143 --> 01:19:31.745]  I told them to get you on the phone because I wanted to tell you what I want, but your phone's really breaking up.
[01:19:31.785 --> 01:19:32.846]  Maybe back off of it a bit.
[01:19:32.866 --> 01:19:35.548]  Listen, we need to go with the headline and call this what it is.
[01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:38.970]  Globalist launch coup over U.S.
[01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:39.971]  seize war powers.
[01:19:40.852 --> 01:19:45.295]  Or globalist coup declares Congress dissolved.
[01:19:45.355 --> 01:19:50.379]  I mean, because, you know, they kept the Roman Senate around for hundreds of years, but it just wasn't there anymore.
[01:19:51.469 --> 01:19:52.530]  And that's what this is.
[01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:55.513]  A globalist coup d'etat.
[01:19:55.793 --> 01:19:57.655]  Congress declared completely ceremonial.
[01:19:58.375 --> 01:20:01.598]  And listen, I want the phone numbers to the House and the Senate.
[01:20:02.779 --> 01:20:05.241]  And I want to call on people to speak out against this.
[01:20:05.702 --> 01:20:10.406]  I mean, especially military officers that are... I mean, will they follow any order?
[01:20:10.426 --> 01:20:11.787]  Will they do anything they're told, Paul?
[01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:16.151]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:16.571]  I agree.
[01:20:20.011 --> 01:20:25.397]  Well, the good news is I'm seeing the military comments all over different news sites and they know it's wrong.
[01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:29.161]  But some of them are in there saying, I'm military and the president is allowed to do this.
[01:20:29.181 --> 01:20:32.344]  In the UN, we've signed treaties, so the UN's above Congress.
[01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:34.527]  Congress can't shine away our authority.
[01:20:34.547 --> 01:20:37.650]  I mean, they can't pass a law saying black people are slaves.
[01:20:38.711 --> 01:20:40.994]  Again, laws that are fraudulent are null and void.
[01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.867]  All these years, Paul, we watched the world government be built.
[01:20:45.148 --> 01:20:46.049]  Now they're launching it.
[01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:50.277]  But simultaneously, we're kooks to talk about it, even as it happens, Paul.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.282]  The problem is, Alex...
[01:20:54.178 --> 01:21:01.163]  They'll be hijacked by all the neocons who will then say, right, now we've established the justification to attack Iran and Syria.
[01:21:01.864 --> 01:21:03.265]  We don't need the UN to do it.
[01:21:03.285 --> 01:21:11.852]  That's what they did for Iraq, so... Well, I mean, that's the debate there, is that, oh, well, you know, the UN has said no to Syria.
[01:21:12.632 --> 01:21:18.117]  Because the Russians vetoed it, and so now they're saying that, you know, Congress is like, well, we don't need the authority.
[01:21:18.137 --> 01:21:22.722]  And they're like, yeah, but we need the authority from the international community because they signed on to that.
[01:21:22.762 --> 01:21:28.047]  But the lawyer trick is to set the precedent that Congress isn't involved.
[01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:30.571]  It's just incredible.
[01:21:30.611 --> 01:21:31.752]  It is so massive.
[01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:35.135]  Paul Watson, we need to get, I know you're churning articles out.
[01:21:35.515 --> 01:21:40.419]  You've got the article out, Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking Panetta testimony.
[01:21:41.079 --> 01:21:43.001]  It's got all the quotes and the video in there.
[01:21:43.521 --> 01:21:49.126]  And it's got Obama coming out and saying he doesn't need Congress anymore with the White House press release.
[01:21:50.147 --> 01:21:51.067]  But you notice even in the
[01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:54.690]  Pentagon saying that they're clarifying it.
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:59.372]  They still imply they're getting the authority from the UN, and that's what Obama said in his letter.
[01:22:01.653 --> 01:22:03.314]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[01:22:03.434 --> 01:22:10.518]  He sent a letter to Boehner, the Speaker of the House last year, saying, I don't need Congress.
[01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:13.720]  I don't even need to think about the constitutional question.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.301]  That was his paraphrased quote.
[01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:19.083]  And he said, I get my authority from the UN Security Council.
[01:22:26.139 --> 01:22:35.864]  But now they're marching into Congress with the generals all lined up, with wily looks, all telling Congress, no, you have no authority, when it's right in the Constitution.
[01:22:52.863 --> 01:22:54.105]  Well, it's total treason.
[01:23:03.075 --> 01:23:07.317]  Out in the open and if the military, I mean I better see the military go public.
[01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:10.539]  I better see everybody in the military should shoot YouTube videos.
[01:23:10.579 --> 01:23:17.142]  It's your right and duty to hold up the Constitution and say Congress funds and directs and tells the President what to do.
[01:23:17.182 --> 01:23:22.365]  He then becomes Commander in Chief and you can read what Congressmen have said that this is a high crime.
[01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:25.387]  You can read and then let them try to go after you.
[01:23:26.772 --> 01:23:29.013]  You watch, they'll probably try behind the scenes to threaten you.
[01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:29.593]  Let them.
[01:23:29.993 --> 01:23:43.699]  I mean, how do you men and women go into combat and get given deadly shots and run up hills with a machine gun nest and all of this, but then when the country's in trouble, will you morally just say, I'm not going to be part of this treason?
[01:23:44.399 --> 01:23:46.060]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.401]  Look, I'm, and don't say, oh no, Alex, we could get in trouble.
[01:23:49.741 --> 01:23:51.462]  Folks, what do you think can happen to me?
[01:23:52.335 --> 01:23:53.856]  You just saw them kill Breitbart.
[01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:54.837]  My gut tells me they did.
[01:23:54.857 --> 01:23:55.637]  The evidence is there.
[01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:59.760]  You've seen all the other dirty tricks they're trying to, you know, destroy Limbaugh right now.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.200]  They're trying to arrest Rupert Murdoch.
[01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:03.462]  Not that those are even great guys, people like Rupert Murdoch.
[01:24:03.662 --> 01:24:05.763]  The point is, the old guard's getting thrown out.
[01:24:05.843 --> 01:24:06.744]  The new time's here.
[01:24:07.144 --> 01:24:09.966]  And we got a bunch of globalist, revolutionary criminals.
[01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:18.189]  That are, you know, engaged in all sorts of crimes, doing everything they can to bring this country down, and it's now time for people to put up or shut up.
[01:24:18.469 --> 01:24:23.331]  If you won't stand up to this, then just get ready, folks, because the sky's the limit.
[01:24:23.751 --> 01:24:32.334]  Paul Watson, when's the next big article coming out on the public coup launch that Congress declared ceremonial?
[01:24:33.953 --> 01:24:34.874]  Obama and U.N.
[01:24:34.894 --> 01:24:36.215]  declare Congress ceremonial.
[01:24:36.815 --> 01:24:37.516]  I mean, it's it.
[01:24:37.836 --> 01:24:38.857]  I mean, the country's gone.
[01:24:39.077 --> 01:24:40.258]  I mean, this is it.
[01:24:40.438 --> 01:24:41.239]  There's no debating.
[01:24:41.779 --> 01:24:43.981]  And watch, notice all the censorship starting right now.
[01:24:44.301 --> 01:24:46.202]  Notice all the talk of secret arrest is starting.
[01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:50.805]  Notice the drones are in the skies and the army's at checkpoints and TSA's everywhere.
[01:24:50.946 --> 01:24:55.008]  Because they're getting ready to blow up a bunch of stuff, folks, false flags, and blame it on domestic groups.
[01:24:55.429 --> 01:24:55.829]  It's here.
[01:24:56.369 --> 01:24:57.070]  It's going to happen.
[01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:59.071]  Re-education camps, everything.
[01:25:01.153 --> 01:25:01.353]  Paul?
[01:25:03.693 --> 01:25:06.455]  Yeah, we'll be out as soon as possible.
[01:25:06.475 --> 01:25:07.596]  Alright, thank you so much.
[01:25:08.357 --> 01:25:08.837]  Thanks Alex.
[01:25:09.238 --> 01:25:10.639]  Alright, there goes Paul Watson.
[01:25:10.659 --> 01:25:14.662]  Alright, let's go to the military calls here.
[01:25:14.702 --> 01:25:18.885]  We've got Sergeant in the National Guard.
[01:25:20.387 --> 01:25:23.649]  Dante, we've got TJ, retired officer military.
[01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:26.211]  We've got Nathan, North Carolina, current Marine.
[01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.994]  We've got Zachary, current National Guard.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:39.369]  We've got others coming in, military, current officers especially, but former officers to give your constitutional fact or statement.
[01:25:40.551 --> 01:25:41.932]  Current people, what are you going to do?
[01:25:42.252 --> 01:25:44.355]  I mean, I'm here saying call Congress.
[01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:48.159]  I'm here telling the military stand up and just speak out.
[01:25:48.179 --> 01:25:49.601]  I mean, this is brazenly illegal.
[01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.176]  Who do we go to first here?
[01:25:53.577 --> 01:25:54.697]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:25:55.457 --> 01:25:57.757]  Let's go to Nathan, who's a current Marine.
[01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:01.238]  Nathan, what is your take on this?
[01:26:01.358 --> 01:26:03.119]  Are you as concerned as I am?
[01:26:03.439 --> 01:26:04.579]  Or is it good to have the U.N.
[01:26:04.639 --> 01:26:06.159]  openly telling Congress it doesn't matter?
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.280]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:08.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:10.940]  Oh my God, Alex.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.161]  This is so crazy.
[01:26:12.221 --> 01:26:14.741]  I'm totally agreeing with you 100%.
[01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:16.862]  I had hoped this day wouldn't come.
[01:26:16.882 --> 01:26:18.222]  I've been phoning you for about a year now.
[01:26:18.985 --> 01:26:24.890]  And every day it just gets worse, you know, to the point I've stopped watching every day because it's scary almost.
[01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:30.335]  I've been watching about once a week on the show and stuff like that, and it's terrible.
[01:26:30.555 --> 01:26:37.542]  And I feel really small, there's not much I can do, you know, I tell everybody I can, but other than that there's really not much else I can do.
[01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:43.207]  And I hope, like you said, that it turns around or else this is going to get bad really quick.
[01:26:45.094 --> 01:26:52.080]  Why do you think they would have Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman come in and over and over again say, no, the U.N.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.201]  gives us the authority for war?
[01:26:53.761 --> 01:26:55.323]  I mean, you could debate the President.
[01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:56.824]  Obviously, that's illegal.
[01:26:57.104 --> 01:26:58.666]  But now they're saying the U.N.
[01:26:58.746 --> 01:26:59.346]  and NATO?
[01:26:59.466 --> 01:27:00.407]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:01.988 --> 01:27:03.530]  This is really scary, Alex.
[01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:07.533]  When Libya happened, I was all over that.
[01:27:07.553 --> 01:27:08.934]  Obviously, that's illegal.
[01:27:10.703 --> 01:27:14.689]  It's uh, Obama got the National Nobel Prize for Peace for that.
[01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:15.370]  Can you believe that?
[01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.653]  Anyways, um, yeah.
[01:27:17.673 --> 01:27:18.995]  A few of them, yeah.
[01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:30.887]  It's not something you can really talk about unless you're behind closed doors here, but yeah, I have a few supporters.
[01:27:31.327 --> 01:27:33.949]  But I mean, what if the President says start taking the guns?
[01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:35.630]  There's a point you're going to have to speak up.
[01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:43.255]  I mean, look, if the President says he gets his orders from the UN, is your chain of command the United Nations soldier?
[01:27:43.295 --> 01:27:44.596]  That's what I'm asking you, Marine.
[01:27:46.258 --> 01:27:48.359]  I will not ever fire on American citizens.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.661]  I will never do that.
[01:27:50.861 --> 01:27:52.162]  If the order ever comes, I'm gone.
[01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:54.131]  I will not go that far.
[01:28:14.941 --> 01:28:17.003]  The President gets his orders from the U.N.?
[01:28:17.023 --> 01:28:19.645]  I mean, you can't follow his orders!
[01:28:20.085 --> 01:28:23.447]  He's an open, foreign, espionage asset!
[01:28:23.968 --> 01:28:24.688]  It's a coup!
[01:28:25.469 --> 01:28:26.550]  Those aren't words, man!
[01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:27.430]  This is happening!
[01:28:29.092 --> 01:28:30.573]  The Senators couldn't breathe!
[01:28:30.633 --> 01:28:32.634]  They were, I'm having trouble breathing!
[01:28:32.714 --> 01:28:34.416]  I mean, this is hardcore!
[01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:42.582]  Let's go to T.J., retired officer, then I'll go to current military.
[01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:44.023]  T.J., your take on this.
[01:28:45.131 --> 01:28:46.912]  Alex Zamri is T.J.
[01:28:46.992 --> 01:28:52.374]  and I'm a retired Army Staff Sergeant, not an officer, but I've been an embassy liaison.
[01:28:52.454 --> 01:28:52.954]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:52.974 --> 01:28:53.955]  It's what it said on my computer screen.
[01:28:53.975 --> 01:28:54.415]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:28:55.395 --> 01:28:55.735]  Okay.
[01:28:56.476 --> 01:28:58.156]  You're a great Signal Corps.
[01:28:58.897 --> 01:29:04.679]  You are the Signal Corps officer, but we can't win this without combat arms.
[01:29:04.719 --> 01:29:07.060]  That's armor, infantry, air defense.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.422]  When we get these spray planes out of our sky, when we meet at every meeting,
[01:29:13.343 --> 01:29:19.750]  In bellicose fashion, face to face with the county commissioners, etc, etc.
[01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:25.055]  And remember this, UN says UN and they are done and on.
[01:29:25.555 --> 01:29:30.140]  And I'll be fighting them on the 27th of March in a formal meeting.
[01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:35.485]  And I hope I got friends with me, but you got to have more than a Signal Corps.
[01:29:35.525 --> 01:29:36.947]  You got to have combat arms.
[01:29:37.777 --> 01:29:44.140]  People have to be on the ground in the info war, as Paul Revere is everywhere, pointing out the open traitors.
[01:29:44.541 --> 01:29:46.262]  The traitors are trying to hide it in plain view.
[01:29:46.322 --> 01:29:47.422]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:29:47.742 --> 01:29:48.283]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.483 --> 01:29:50.364]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.864 --> 01:29:52.465]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.405 --> 01:29:56.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.703 --> 01:30:05.408]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[01:30:05.688 --> 01:30:17.900]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[01:30:50.473 --> 01:30:53.436]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:04.303]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.623 --> 01:31:04.903]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:08.685]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.966 --> 01:31:09.526]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.826 --> 01:31:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:15.170]  It's true.
[01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:20.013]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.333 --> 01:31:20.873]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.153 --> 01:31:24.435]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.736 --> 01:31:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.638 --> 01:31:29.198]  Number four.
[01:31:29.438 --> 01:31:31.799]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.199 --> 01:31:35.581]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.881 --> 01:31:36.421]  Number five.
[01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:40.583]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.823 --> 01:31:45.585]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.865 --> 01:31:49.886]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:51.607]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.827 --> 01:31:56.429]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:56.749 --> 01:31:56.789]  877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.769 --> 01:32:05.390]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:13.852]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.592 --> 01:32:18.633]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.213 --> 01:32:30.035]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.675 --> 01:32:39.678]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.178 --> 01:32:45.220]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:52.783]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.103 --> 01:32:55.844]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:00.696 --> 01:33:01.519]  Yeah.
[01:33:10.137 --> 01:33:11.778]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:12.558]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:12.598 --> 01:33:17.780]  Central we're here live and I got a big incredibly important nightly news this evening.
[01:33:18.621 --> 01:33:23.863]  They're launching a new propaganda effort to launch a full invasion of Central Africa and other areas.
[01:33:23.883 --> 01:33:27.585]  We're gonna be breaking that down and some State Department propaganda we've discovered.
[01:33:28.165 --> 01:33:32.847]  We'll also be going more over this but you know we can't get the military calls in because
[01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:39.397]  Nine out of ten are people saying, well I'm not military, I'm not current military, but I got a point I want to make.
[01:33:39.457 --> 01:33:45.024]  Folks, I'm going to institute full call screening if people just don't have basic respect here.
[01:33:46.065 --> 01:33:48.387]  You know, our country is in a deep crisis.
[01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:53.073]  I want to talk to current serving military and ask them
[01:33:55.686 --> 01:34:06.172]  If they're going to follow illegal orders, and if they realize how treasonous this is, to have a coup d'etat with the Secretary of Defense, the President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying they take their orders from the UN and NATO.
[01:34:06.733 --> 01:34:08.214]  I need to hear from them.
[01:34:08.714 --> 01:34:10.515]  I need to hear what the military is saying.
[01:34:11.295 --> 01:34:16.258]  And the phone systems, of course, when we get the number out, just blast with literally hundreds of calls a minute.
[01:34:16.759 --> 01:34:18.200]  And I'm not trying to be mad at people.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.681]  I'm glad you want to call in and say something.
[01:34:19.901 --> 01:34:21.822]  We can do that after we talk to the military.
[01:34:22.807 --> 01:34:27.431]  But don't call right now if you're not active in the military, because they can't get into the show.
[01:34:27.451 --> 01:34:28.612]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:29.032 --> 01:34:32.575]  Of course, no one will listen to me.
[01:34:33.075 --> 01:34:34.456]  They'll just be hung up on, though, folks.
[01:34:35.157 --> 01:34:36.177]  So knock yourselves out.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.643]  We've got Sergeant National Guard and another National Guard, Zachary.
[01:34:43.479 --> 01:34:47.505]  And if anybody can get in, I know I always get calls from troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and at bases.
[01:34:47.545 --> 01:34:48.346]  I want to hear from you.
[01:34:49.187 --> 01:34:52.292]  Let's go to Zachary and then we'll go to Dante.
[01:34:52.672 --> 01:34:54.114]  Zachary, you're on the air.
[01:34:54.996 --> 01:34:59.703]  What's your take on the publicly announced coup d'etat hidden in plain view of the UN and NATO over America?
[01:35:00.779 --> 01:35:12.884]  It's a pretty sad day for the Republic there, Mr. Jones, but I have a book that I got from, it's the Soldier's Handbook while I was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, trade-off pamphlet 600-4, 1 October 2003.
[01:35:16.105 --> 01:35:19.446]  And it says, loyalty, bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S.
[01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:22.828]  Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other soldiers.
[01:35:23.308 --> 01:35:31.751]  It goes on to say, to be loyal is to be unswerving in allegiance to the Constitution and completely faithful to the lawful government.
[01:35:32.151 --> 01:35:36.913]  Our absolute allegiance and faithfulness prevents us from misplacing our loyalties.
[01:35:37.583 --> 01:35:38.984]  And that was 2-2.
[01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:40.546]  The next page, 2-3.
[01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:43.208]  A loyal individual does the following.
[01:35:43.468 --> 01:35:45.590]  Respects the Constitution and laws.
[01:35:46.131 --> 01:35:47.052]  And it goes on.
[01:35:47.092 --> 01:35:51.676]  But the next page, there's a quote for all military members calling in.
[01:35:51.696 --> 01:35:52.757]  It says, Duty.
[01:35:52.897 --> 01:35:54.178]  Fulfill your obligations.
[01:35:54.218 --> 01:35:55.439]  This is page 2-5.
[01:35:55.459 --> 01:36:00.924]  There's a quote from General John A. Wickham, former Army Chief of Staff.
[01:36:01.454 --> 01:36:10.982]  He says, the essence of duty is acting in the absence of orders or direction from others based on an inner sense of what is morally and professionally right.
[01:36:11.482 --> 01:36:17.327]  It goes on from that quote, duty delineates the sum total of all laws, rules, etc.
[01:36:17.667 --> 01:36:21.490]  that make up our organizational, civic, and moral obligations.
[01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:29.048]  Our values originate with duty because, at a minimum, we expect all members of the Army to fulfill their obligations.
[01:36:29.428 --> 01:36:34.272]  We often expect individuals to exceed their duty, especially in ethical matters.
[01:36:34.852 --> 01:36:37.974]  And, uh, this certainly is, uh, an ethical matter.
[01:36:38.975 --> 01:36:41.456]  Back up, that's from eight, nine years ago.
[01:36:41.476 --> 01:36:43.977]  This was 2003, yeah.
[01:36:44.377 --> 01:36:55.161]  I've seen, and read on air, stuff from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, where it's, if a president ever tries to use you domestically, they are a traitor and a tyrant.
[01:36:56.302 --> 01:36:58.543]  Congress is in control of the military.
[01:36:58.583 --> 01:37:03.865]  The president, only commander-in-chief, once given a duly sworn bill of war, declaration of war.
[01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.946]  And so even what you're reading is okay,
[01:37:08.143 --> 01:37:10.984]  But nothing compared to the Constitution itself.
[01:37:11.024 --> 01:37:25.107]  Did you hear me earlier when I read from the Constitution where a president launching a military operation without full congressional authorization is engaged in a high crime and misdemeanor?
[01:37:25.727 --> 01:37:31.148]  I mean, the Constitution tells you what it is, but look, it's bad enough to have a president saying, I do what I want militarily.
[01:37:32.248 --> 01:37:34.390]  This is them saying the U.N.
[01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:36.933]  is the authority and NATO.
[01:37:37.093 --> 01:37:50.526]  The President's saying that in the chain of command, until about 50 years ago they taught, until about the Korean War actually, they taught Congress is at the top of the chain of command, then the President, then down to you.
[01:37:51.247 --> 01:37:54.349]  Since then, well, the President during a war, then they kind of blurred that.
[01:37:54.789 --> 01:37:57.231]  And then now, well, we get authorizations, not declarations.
[01:37:57.611 --> 01:38:02.434]  And then now they're saying, listen, Congress, Congress is like, but we are who gives you the authorization, correct?
[01:38:02.814 --> 01:38:04.955]  And the SecDef says, no, the UN.
[01:38:05.015 --> 01:38:06.736]  I'm going to play it here in a minute.
[01:38:06.996 --> 01:38:08.457]  But I mean, what do you make of that?
[01:38:08.497 --> 01:38:11.459]  That is just, that is off the charts right there.
[01:38:11.879 --> 01:38:15.181]  I mean, just because it's the UN or NATO, how about saying Russia gives them the orders?
[01:38:15.421 --> 01:38:15.982]  Or China?
[01:38:17.003 --> 01:38:19.528]  Or, you know, Martians for that matter.
[01:38:19.568 --> 01:38:20.509]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:21.672]  This is globalism!
[01:38:21.852 --> 01:38:22.854]  This is world government!
[01:38:22.994 --> 01:38:25.939]  This is a global government coup in our face, sir!
[01:38:27.415 --> 01:38:34.758]  Absolutely, and as Mayor Amshel Rothschild said, give me the power to coin a nation's currency and I care not who makes its laws.
[01:38:35.118 --> 01:38:39.440]  And of course, one of the planks of the Communist Manifesto is for a private central bank.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.201]  The whole system is corrupt.
[01:38:41.561 --> 01:38:46.343]  Knowledge is power, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:38:46.683 --> 01:38:48.964]  And if that is true, and I'm certain it is,
[01:38:49.404 --> 01:38:56.171]  Then the media would never tell us the whole truth to anything because we might start to understand the true nature of our predicament.
[01:38:56.532 --> 01:39:05.561]  And thanks to you and your show and all the guests that you have on, we understand that humanity's under attack and the whole bioethicist, eugenicist thing that you're talking about.
[01:39:05.581 --> 01:39:08.765]  Hey, they've used the troops to test vaccines on us.
[01:39:09.205 --> 01:39:09.406]  We're good.
[01:39:21.425 --> 01:39:22.245]  Oh, it's on record.
[01:39:22.285 --> 01:39:24.947]  Listen, and they lie to you and say, you don't have any rights.
[01:39:24.987 --> 01:39:27.008]  We're going to test experimental shots on you.
[01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:31.810]  They can only make you take totally approved vaccines.
[01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:35.572]  And there's only about 15 or so that are on the FDA recommended list.
[01:39:35.872 --> 01:39:42.075]  So when they test all this dengue fever and this and that and smallpox anthrax shots, but it killed so many people.
[01:39:42.735 --> 01:39:44.356]  So many people dropped dead from the shots.
[01:39:44.416 --> 01:39:45.937]  They had to suspend both of those.
[01:39:45.977 --> 01:39:47.458]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:39:48.376 --> 01:39:49.918]  You're a sergeant in the National Guard.
[01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:54.782]  Obviously, you've got to know, and you're calling in.
[01:39:54.802 --> 01:39:57.946]  Where are you calling in from?
[01:39:58.646 --> 01:40:00.228]  I'm calling in from Maine.
[01:40:00.388 --> 01:40:01.869]  Okay, so you're calling in from Maine.
[01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:06.834]  All I know is around here they're having National Guard do checkpoints and show up at events to acclimate us.
[01:40:07.155 --> 01:40:09.097]  I mean, are you guys getting more riot control?
[01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:12.040]  Are you seeing evidence of them gearing you up for domestic operations?
[01:40:13.485 --> 01:40:16.727]  Uh, well, I can't really speak too much for that.
[01:40:17.107 --> 01:40:23.051]  I've worked crowd control at a naval base for an air show, but that's... Yeah, that's one thing on a base is fine, yeah.
[01:40:23.532 --> 01:40:28.415]  But, I mean, you see, like, Army Times saying they're going to use the military domestically against citizens, right?
[01:40:29.133 --> 01:40:29.693]  Oh, I've read it.
[01:40:30.054 --> 01:40:37.079]  I keep up to date with the stuff that you post, and certainly it was concerning seeing that kite festival that you posted there.
[01:40:37.219 --> 01:40:39.801]  Yeah, here in Austin, let me ask you this.
[01:40:40.261 --> 01:40:45.625]  Are the people in the military around you, in the Army, National Guard, are they starting to realize something's not right?
[01:40:46.411 --> 01:40:48.732]  Well, yeah, there definitely is a vibe there.
[01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:59.458]  There's certainly some of us that are more awake than others and certainly have questioned for quite some time now the official myth of September 11th and what went down on that day.
[01:40:59.578 --> 01:41:02.840]  And it's pretty obvious we're being lied to.
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:09.004]  And I commend all the work that you've done and the people that are speaking out to bring justice to what happened.
[01:41:09.124 --> 01:41:12.426]  And thank you for bringing that Syria blogger on the other day.
[01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:16.228]  It was great to listen to her and her perspective.
[01:41:16.866 --> 01:41:21.331]  Let me ask you this question, Zachary, in closing, and we'll go to others, and I, again, appreciate you taking the time out to call.
[01:41:23.052 --> 01:41:24.734]  What should the military do?
[01:41:24.834 --> 01:41:31.241]  I mean, if I was in the military, especially an officer, because you've got more responsibilities, as you know, to duty than just enlisted, and
[01:41:32.563 --> 01:41:42.036]  I've sworn an oath to protect the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, and the cornerstone of treason is a president declaring he controls the military and can do whatever he wants.
[01:41:42.857 --> 01:41:47.764]  And then it goes beyond that saying foreign power is controlling, which is even worse if it's possible.
[01:41:48.605 --> 01:41:52.569]  I mean, what country has ever had a president or leader that's an actual foreign agent?
[01:41:52.669 --> 01:42:05.019]  It's one thing to have your own dictator, but then the person taking on despotic powers is a foreign agent and says so to their bosses in the Congress when it comes to military matters.
[01:42:05.039 --> 01:42:10.323]  You don't give the president the power of the military unilaterally because you can't be trusted with it.
[01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:11.624]  You've got to share that.
[01:42:13.362 --> 01:42:14.303]  Checks and balances.
[01:42:14.363 --> 01:42:20.528]  I mean, it's just, it is the worst case of out-in-the-open treason I can imagine.
[01:42:20.869 --> 01:42:22.130]  And it's flaunted openly.
[01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:29.657]  And the New York Times has a little footnote about, oh, there's a little fight between the legislative and executive about who runs things.
[01:42:29.737 --> 01:42:33.580]  It's like, oh, the price of tea in China discussion.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.501]  Like, it's no big deal.
[01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:38.745]  And then it, oh, man, it's exhausting me mentally.
[01:42:40.157 --> 01:42:52.015]  Oh yeah, it is exhausting, but to answer your question there about, you know, ideally what should be done is the example that was set a couple of weeks ago in Afghanistan with the Koran burning.
[01:42:52.095 --> 01:42:53.958]  You had all those people in the streets
[01:42:54.488 --> 01:42:54.969]  We're good to go.
[01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:12.452]  From the guy there, Panetta.
[01:43:12.792 --> 01:43:14.973]  You know, we don't answer to the UN.
[01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:19.974]  You know, if we get on the streets en masse and just said, hey, we've had enough, we're not doing it.
[01:43:19.994 --> 01:43:21.675]  Well, I'll tell you where the digital streets are.
[01:43:21.755 --> 01:43:30.198]  YouTube, letters to the editor, and then if they try to go after somebody, you've got congressmen coming out saying it's a high crime, and you're like, look!
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:39.021]  My so-called Commander-in-Chief, who's not your Commander-in-Chief because there's no declared war, is telling me he gets orders from the UN.
[01:43:39.041 --> 01:43:41.982]  The UN and NATO is not in my chain of command.
[01:43:42.302 --> 01:43:43.722]  It doesn't command America.
[01:43:43.962 --> 01:43:45.403]  God bless you, I appreciate you calling.
[01:43:46.283 --> 01:43:50.063]  I mean, we've got, now that the gauntlet's down, I mean, they're not hiding this.
[01:43:51.004 --> 01:43:52.684]  And they're saying the UN runs America.
[01:43:53.564 --> 01:43:54.804]  And that Congress doesn't count.
[01:43:54.844 --> 01:43:55.524]  I mean, come on!
[01:43:55.984 --> 01:43:59.185]  Congress and the House and Senate have finally introduced legislation.
[01:44:00.464 --> 01:44:02.365]  Saying we might impeach you.
[01:44:04.406 --> 01:44:05.407]  You've got to do that.
[01:44:06.888 --> 01:44:08.929]  I mean, even that corrupt body knows this.
[01:44:08.969 --> 01:44:10.270]  This is incredible.
[01:44:11.651 --> 01:44:18.075]  Can you imagine the Russians, as corrupt as their government is, coming out, a Russian president saying to the Duma,
[01:44:19.246 --> 01:44:20.027]  To their Congress.
[01:44:40.712 --> 01:44:42.894]  Instantly there'd be an outcry from the Russians.
[01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:44.054]  They'd be in the streets.
[01:44:44.314 --> 01:44:45.635]  The military would outcry.
[01:44:46.816 --> 01:44:49.898]  They would arrest Putin like that.
[01:44:51.599 --> 01:44:52.160]  Just boom.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.401]  He'd be arrested or his helicopter would blow up.
[01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:55.562]  That's how the Russians do it.
[01:44:55.582 --> 01:44:56.202]  He would die.
[01:44:58.844 --> 01:45:02.987]  Alexander Lebed was caught sneaking around working with the West and his helicopter blew up.
[01:45:04.087 --> 01:45:06.329]  But again, we're not dealing with puppet presidents here.
[01:45:07.273 --> 01:45:10.116]  Obama is just a little corporate whore, New World Order lawyer.
[01:45:10.496 --> 01:45:11.957]  It's a bunch of lawyers, man.
[01:45:12.137 --> 01:45:15.460]  And they create these international bodies and have traders sign over.
[01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:20.805]  Like a lawyer stealing your portfolio, or you got a trust and the lawyer signs your house over to themselves.
[01:45:20.825 --> 01:45:21.486]  That happens all the time.
[01:45:21.606 --> 01:45:22.186]  That's what they've done.
[01:45:22.206 --> 01:45:29.313]  They just sign America over and sit there arrogantly like the pigs they are in front of Congress.
[01:45:32.103 --> 01:45:39.606]  And the Congress is like, well, we know we're just little sell-out criminals that you've got blackmailed for insider trading, but don't publicly announce we don't run anything now.
[01:45:40.046 --> 01:45:40.886]  That's embarrassing.
[01:45:40.926 --> 01:45:43.927]  I want to feel powerful at the country club today, playing golf.
[01:45:44.527 --> 01:45:46.728]  But then it's like, yeah, you don't run Jack Squat, pal.
[01:45:46.948 --> 01:45:48.369]  I haven't even gotten to the video yet.
[01:45:48.609 --> 01:45:50.209]  It's at Infowars.com.
[01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:53.070]  I'm exhausted now.
[01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:54.411]  I don't know how I'm going to do the nightly news.
[01:45:54.491 --> 01:45:55.551]  I'm beyond angry.
[01:45:55.631 --> 01:45:56.932]  It is just, it's ridiculous.
[01:45:58.462 --> 01:46:03.966]  It'd be like if you're walking down the street and they had babies out live hanging by their feet and were saying, hey, you want some fresh meat?
[01:46:04.246 --> 01:46:08.189]  And they were chopping babies up like fish with big meat cleavers.
[01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:13.393]  And everybody's just walking by with shopping bags going up and it's being wrapped in white paper.
[01:46:13.954 --> 01:46:15.355]  I mean, it's that crazy.
[01:46:16.776 --> 01:46:20.078]  And everybody just goes along with their business like, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:46:21.339 --> 01:46:25.042]  Secretary of Defense, Obama, all of them say the UN, tell us what to do.
[01:46:25.142 --> 01:46:25.943]  It's nothing.
[01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:27.990]  And it's like England.
[01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:33.532]  80 plus percent of their laws are now made by foreign EU, which isn't even the EU countries.
[01:46:33.572 --> 01:46:34.732]  That's made by the bureaucracy.
[01:46:34.952 --> 01:46:39.574]  And the EU countries are being told now, foreign banks run us, and you have no national sovereignty.
[01:46:41.634 --> 01:46:46.215]  And the military and police are following orders, and NATO controls Europe, and says they're the world army now.
[01:46:48.956 --> 01:46:51.537]  It's the global government army, and our army is part of it.
[01:46:52.551 --> 01:47:01.436]  And those generals sit there, getting off on it and showing satisfaction when Panetta tells them, we take our orders from NATO and the UN.
[01:47:01.636 --> 01:47:10.701]  And I'm watching the generals, and I'm watching their adjuncts behind them, and their minions, and they all look like Cheshire Cats, so satisfied.
[01:47:10.721 --> 01:47:14.643]  Oh man, these people are traitors!
[01:47:15.343 --> 01:47:18.445]  I mean, and I don't just use that word, these are enemies of our country!
[01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:26.580]  I'm getting a headache.
[01:47:28.662 --> 01:47:33.207]  Dante, Sergeant in the National Guard, sir, what is your take on this?
[01:47:33.227 --> 01:47:38.453]  I mean, am I wrong, or is it good to have the Secretary of Defense and Obama announce we follow the UN?
[01:47:38.473 --> 01:47:39.194]  They're our boss now.
[01:47:41.216 --> 01:47:45.260]  Well, I guess if you're following the Communist Manifesto, that'd be a good thing to have, Alex.
[01:47:46.351 --> 01:47:52.934]  For the rest of us over here that actually value our liberty and our freedoms and actually try to stand up to that type of tyranny, it's not a good thing at all.
[01:47:53.434 --> 01:47:57.136]  I've actually been, um, I've been following the show since I was about 15 years old.
[01:47:57.176 --> 01:48:10.262]  I'm 21 now, and I've held public screenings, I've held public viewings, I've spoken to my soldiers, to people in my direct chain of command, and for the most part, outside of the people in my direct community where I rest my head at, it's like a joke to a lot of the people in my unit.
[01:48:10.302 --> 01:48:13.303]  They're just like, okay, haha, I'm gonna go home and go to sleep now.
[01:48:13.843 --> 01:48:16.184]  You know, it's okay because it's the President.
[01:48:16.204 --> 01:48:17.045]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:48:17.185 --> 01:48:18.965]  If you don't trust him, you should get out of the military.
[01:48:19.005 --> 01:48:21.527]  Well, I'm not in the military for the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:48:21.847 --> 01:48:23.468]  I'm in the military to defend my country.
[01:48:24.228 --> 01:48:25.669]  You know, that's just why I joined.
[01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:36.514]  Oh yeah, the Germans, there was a debate in Germany about, no, you're supposed to follow the Constitution, the Weimar Republic, the Reichstag, and then Hitler had them all change the oath to him.
[01:48:36.534 --> 01:48:40.415]  And so I guess that's what they, wow, so you're saying they're ready to do it.
[01:48:40.435 --> 01:48:41.336]  They're ready to do whatever they're told.
[01:48:42.472 --> 01:48:44.933]  I mean, here in Jersey, there's different units.
[01:48:45.474 --> 01:48:59.901]  My unit in particular, let's say out of 100,000 guys, let's just use that number, out of 100,000, about 75,000 would probably just stand there and do what they're told because, you know, their mentality is, okay, whatever, I'm going to do this and I'm going to go home.
[01:49:00.321 --> 01:49:07.285]  And I'm looking at these guys like, what are you going to do when the areas that are being targeted and the people that are being groped and the weapons that are being taken are yours?
[01:49:07.625 --> 01:49:08.605]  What are you going to do then?
[01:49:08.745 --> 01:49:10.286]  And they're looking at me like, oh, this guy's a nut.
[01:49:10.686 --> 01:49:11.486]  It'll never happen.
[01:49:11.786 --> 01:49:14.167]  And you know, I'm already under surveillance as it is, Alex.
[01:49:14.187 --> 01:49:16.188]  My first tour to Iraq was in 0809.
[01:49:16.608 --> 01:49:20.870]  You know, I was under surveillance for listening to the Alex Jones Show overseas just because I'm Muslim.
[01:49:20.890 --> 01:49:22.370]  They thought I was going to do something crazy.
[01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:23.390]  I came back.
[01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:27.932]  Now I'm about to go over to Afghanistan again to put my life on the line for the bull, the bull mess.
[01:49:28.452 --> 01:49:29.833]  And I'm under surveillance again.
[01:49:29.873 --> 01:49:31.353]  I get followed home sometimes.
[01:49:31.673 --> 01:49:33.574]  My roommate's been followed home sometimes.
[01:49:33.954 --> 01:49:38.578]  My girlfriend, you know, it's ridiculous, Alex, and I'm not going to stand for it.
[01:49:38.958 --> 01:49:41.441]  I dare somebody to tell me to turn a weapon on an innocent U.S.
[01:49:41.461 --> 01:49:43.182]  citizen or start confiscating weapons.
[01:49:43.522 --> 01:49:52.770]  Especially in a state where you have to go through six to seven month trials to be able to carry a weapon with a permit or even purchase a rifle or a shotgun to go hunting.
[01:49:53.191 --> 01:49:54.552]  So, I wish somebody would.
[01:49:55.981 --> 01:49:57.822]  Well, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:49:57.842 --> 01:50:02.805]  That's a sad testament that 70 plus percent think everything's a joke.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:06.587]  But remember, it's always the minority, the three to five percent that says no to tyranny.
[01:50:08.308 --> 01:50:17.694]  All I know is that they're not announcing this to the Senate for no reason.
[01:50:17.914 --> 01:50:20.196]  Everything is thought out by Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:50:21.056 --> 01:50:25.099]  The fact that they would march in there, in front of their bosses,
[01:50:26.235 --> 01:50:27.798]  Our representatives that work for us.
[01:50:28.439 --> 01:50:29.942]  We're at the top of the pyramid in this country.
[01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:33.610]  Then the Congress, then the President, then the courts.
[01:50:36.275 --> 01:50:37.717]  The fact that they would do that...
[01:50:41.766 --> 01:50:47.369]  The fact that they, it just shows that they're getting ready to pull the trigger on some big stuff.
[01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:48.750]  There is some good news.
[01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:58.877]  In the House and Senate, legislation has been introduced by Republicans and Democrats to begin the process of impeachment against Barack Hussein, the traitor Obama.
[01:51:00.256 --> 01:51:04.279]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:05.921]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:14.648]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:18.271]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:51:18.531 --> 01:51:19.412]  But take heart.
[01:51:19.432 --> 01:51:23.095]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:28.360]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:32.303]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:34.064]  The globalists are scared.
[01:51:34.325 --> 01:51:35.325]  They've overreached.
[01:51:35.666 --> 01:51:38.808]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:04.791]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:54:01.953 --> 01:54:19.677]  You know, I would just change the song to say, Preemptive War!
[01:54:20.438 --> 01:54:22.358]  What is it good for?
[01:54:23.679 --> 01:54:24.819]  Absolutely nothing!
[01:54:26.038 --> 01:54:29.939]  You lose the moral authority, and you become the enemy.
[01:54:31.139 --> 01:54:32.880]  Again, this is not our government.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.001]  It's illegitimate.
[01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.801]  But it dresses like us, it acts like us.
[01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:42.223]  That's why Cicero, you guys reprint me the full Cicero quote on the traitor.
[01:54:43.223 --> 01:54:44.723]  Cicero, the traitor is the plague.
[01:54:44.743 --> 01:54:45.964]  That'll bring it up.
[01:54:46.064 --> 01:54:47.844]  Roman philosopher, historian.
[01:54:49.705 --> 01:54:53.206]  The traitor knows how to dress like you, talk like you, talk like us.
[01:54:54.318 --> 01:54:56.741]  And that's all this is, is treason by lawyers.
[01:54:58.322 --> 01:54:59.924]  And again, I'm going to play it the next hour.
[01:54:59.964 --> 01:55:03.748]  The video is up at InfoWars.com, the audio, the transcript.
[01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:05.711]  I've read from it.
[01:55:07.953 --> 01:55:13.019]  Members of Congress in the House and Senate have introduced legislation putting them on notice of moves for impeachment.
[01:55:14.659 --> 01:55:21.565]  If the President won't just say, yes, Congress gives me the authority to launch wars, but Obama wouldn't say it last year.
[01:55:21.585 --> 01:55:23.026]  And I was like, wow, that's big.
[01:55:23.366 --> 01:55:25.228]  And now he's saying it again to their faces.
[01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:27.710]  That's putting them on notice.
[01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:28.791]  That's a legal precedent.
[01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:34.215]  And it is, by every historical measurement, a coup against the Republic.
[01:55:35.616 --> 01:55:37.758]  A coup by a dictator if Obama tried it.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.381]  But it's a foreign coup.
[01:55:45.759 --> 01:55:46.579]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:55:46.759 --> 01:55:48.440]  I won't follow Obama's unlawful orders.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.441]  Marine could be disciplined over Facebook outbursts.
[01:55:50.921 --> 01:55:58.964]  The Marine Corps is looking into whether Sergeant Gary Stein broke military rules when he declared on Facebook that he would not follow orders from the Commander-in-Chief, President Obama.
[01:56:01.325 --> 01:56:09.508]  While Stein softened his statement on the Armed Forces Tea Party Patriot page to say that he would not follow unlawful orders, military observers say he may have gone too far.
[01:56:09.528 --> 01:56:10.829]  It's all part of discipline.
[01:56:12.469 --> 01:56:14.390]  And what did he specifically say he wouldn't follow?
[01:56:16.226 --> 01:56:19.148]  See, they don't even want you to know in here what it is that he said.
[01:56:19.208 --> 01:56:20.349]  Is he even talking about this?
[01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:24.632]  Let him start trying to discipline people that say they won't follow orders from the UN.
[01:56:28.975 --> 01:56:30.957]  He says Armed Forces Tea Party and myself is...
[01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:34.498]  Gone and rubbed some people the wrong way with a Marine Corps.
[01:56:34.879 --> 01:56:36.719]  Someone is mad because of a comment I stated.
[01:56:36.779 --> 01:56:39.380]  Obama was a domestic enemy of our oath.
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:40.640]  Speaks of.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:43.061]  It was not meant to be disrespectful towards the President.
[01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:43.881]  Well, he's not our President.
[01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:45.281]  He is a globalist operative.
[01:56:45.761 --> 01:56:48.442]  Although we do believe that his policies are crippling this country.
[01:56:48.782 --> 01:56:52.163]  So this isn't, I'm sure this is to do with energy or something like that.
[01:56:52.523 --> 01:56:53.943]  Again, that's a complete side issue.
[01:56:53.963 --> 01:56:54.483]  Thank you guys.
[01:56:55.143 --> 01:56:58.184]  That's a complete side issue that Dew brought in here, but I'm glad he did bring it in.
[01:56:59.985 --> 01:57:01.705]  Obama is a nothing puppet.
[01:57:03.257 --> 01:57:08.000]  All right, I see that we have Martinez, who's a Marine.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.441]  We have Mike in New York, who's U.S.
[01:57:11.582 --> 01:57:11.862]  Army.
[01:57:12.522 --> 01:57:13.803]  We haven't talked to regular Army yet.
[01:57:13.823 --> 01:57:15.043]  It's been a bunch of National Guard.
[01:57:15.724 --> 01:57:17.205]  Dustin in Texas, who's Army.
[01:57:17.685 --> 01:57:19.826]  Private Jay, National Guard.
[01:57:20.586 --> 01:57:21.687]  Some other Marines and people.
[01:57:21.707 --> 01:57:22.708]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:57:23.168 --> 01:57:27.450]  I've done one hour and 57 minutes of radio and haven't really plugged anything.
[01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:32.253]  Lately, you've noticed I'm not even plugging books, videos, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:57:33.902 --> 01:57:47.651]  Because I'm just, the news is so insane, and the guys come to me and say, hey, we're not selling a lot of books and videos, and all we're selling is the InfoWars business cards at cost, so you just know that the tank's not being replenished.
[01:57:48.232 --> 01:57:56.057]  If you believe in what we're doing and want tools to wake people up, we've got books, videos, t-shirts, bumper stickers, everything at InfoWars.com, or call 888-253-3139.

[01:58:05.826 --> 01:58:13.195]  Bloodlines Illuminati, the new Thrive film, Behind the Green Mask, Gen 21, The Survivors book.
[01:58:14.653 --> 01:58:15.213]  It's all there.
[01:58:15.353 --> 01:58:19.696]  Infowars.com or 888-25-33139.

[01:58:32.082 --> 01:58:34.604]  By the way, there's big announcements to shut down alternative media.
[01:58:34.624 --> 01:58:35.804]  I haven't even gotten to that yet.
[01:58:36.225 --> 01:58:37.805]  More of your calls in 60 seconds.

[01:58:50.565 --> 01:58:51.585]  I had tried everything.
[01:58:51.665 --> 01:58:53.787]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:58:54.027 --> 01:58:56.708]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:58:57.128 --> 01:59:01.611]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:59:01.971 --> 01:59:08.335]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:59:08.815 --> 01:59:19.301]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:24.163]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:59:24.523 --> 01:59:27.505]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:59:27.865 --> 01:59:30.526]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:30.766 --> 01:59:31.907]  Now that's results.
[01:59:32.327 --> 01:59:38.770]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:59:39.110 --> 01:59:44.452]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:59:47.393 --> 01:59:48.694]  Infowarsteam.com
[01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:54.877]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.358 --> 01:59:58.125]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.741 --> 02:00:08.924]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:09.564 --> 02:00:10.385]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.146 --> 02:00:13.047]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.067 --> 02:00:16.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.890 --> 02:00:21.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.796 --> 02:00:27.037]  We do have some good news.
[02:00:27.177 --> 02:00:30.840]  You know, the video's got about a million views right now.
[02:00:32.148 --> 02:00:33.969]  Breaking down on the scanners are totally fake.
[02:00:33.989 --> 02:00:35.450]  You can carry bombs in them, everything.
[02:00:36.331 --> 02:00:40.974]  The TSA had the video blocked, but due to outrage, it was unblocked this morning.
[02:00:42.314 --> 02:00:48.638]  The TSA is making fun of the American citizens on their blog right now.
[02:00:48.838 --> 02:00:54.142]  TSA mocks viral videos as able to detect threats such as, you know, things that go boom.
[02:00:55.919 --> 02:00:57.460]  Talking to us at a three-year-old level.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.180]  They do that on purpose to dumb the language down.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.342]  It's all part of their psych warfare attack on free humanity.
[02:01:07.944 --> 02:01:10.345]  Let's go back to military calls, because it's the military.
[02:01:10.405 --> 02:01:11.305]  I should ask police.
[02:01:11.405 --> 02:01:13.926]  I mean, I guess you'll follow any order.
[02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:15.987]  The feds are federalizing everything, I confirm.
[02:01:16.007 --> 02:01:19.608]  There's now TSA inspectors at all the police departments and on the streets.
[02:01:20.008 --> 02:01:20.609]  They're the boss.
[02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:22.549]  Everyone's like, the federal inspector's coming.
[02:01:22.569 --> 02:01:23.430]  They tell us what to do.
[02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:27.352]  Because they're unbonded, unsworn, not even federal agents.
[02:01:29.994 --> 02:01:32.595]  And the UN orders our president around now.
[02:01:32.916 --> 02:01:36.898]  And the president tells Congress they have no authority over war now.
[02:01:38.479 --> 02:01:41.802]  Just unbelievable treason and a coup d'etat.
[02:01:41.862 --> 02:01:42.882]  That's what's really happening.
[02:01:43.223 --> 02:01:44.063]  Those aren't just words.
[02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:47.706]  Martinez in California, welcome and thank you for holding, sir.
[02:01:48.106 --> 02:01:49.567]  You're a Marine.
[02:01:49.607 --> 02:01:51.108]  What's your view on what we've been talking about?
[02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:53.950]  Actually, Alex, I'm a woman.
[02:01:54.909 --> 02:01:56.190]  Okay, well it says Marine there.
[02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.570]  Yes, it does.
[02:01:57.650 --> 02:01:58.070]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:58.150 --> 02:01:58.691]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:01:58.711 --> 02:02:00.391]  Yes, I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps.
[02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:03.193]  I work on Camp Pendleton and Del Mar area.
[02:02:04.033 --> 02:02:05.934]  I don't think that this is right at all.
[02:02:06.414 --> 02:02:06.954]  It's wrong.
[02:02:07.214 --> 02:02:10.356]  It's like everything inside me is screaming, what the heck is going on?
[02:02:11.056 --> 02:02:12.977]  You know, I've been listening to you for a while.
[02:02:13.037 --> 02:02:20.320]  My brother actually introduced me to your show and, you know, I actually do a lot of research and, you know, I don't think that it's right at all.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.021]  I mean, people need to wake up.
[02:02:22.717 --> 02:02:24.338]  And people need to, well, you know what?
[02:02:24.498 --> 02:02:25.659]  Actually, I need to tell you this.
[02:02:26.139 --> 02:02:31.682]  People who, you know, they actually swear in, they're in the military, they don't even research the Constitution.
[02:02:31.702 --> 02:02:34.444]  They don't even know that they're supposed to really uphold it.
[02:02:34.784 --> 02:02:43.829]  They don't know the depth of the responsibility that they have to the people to defend them, you know, just in case, like, should something go wrong.
[02:02:44.774 --> 02:02:59.481]  And, you know, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to educate my troops on the Constitution and on the Bill of Rights, the rights that they have, you know, the rights that the people have, and that, you know, what's going on isn't right.
[02:03:00.683 --> 02:03:06.286]  You know, some people tell me I should be careful and not to go around talking about all this stuff.
[02:03:06.706 --> 02:03:11.849]  Sounds like what happened in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia when the military was being told follow legal orders.
[02:03:11.869 --> 02:03:14.050]  Look, it's in the Constitution.
[02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:20.453]  As you know, I read the articles earlier, you've got a House and Senate bill telling the President, hey, we can impeach you.
[02:03:20.513 --> 02:03:23.414]  Again, it's the Congress that impeaches the President.
[02:03:23.895 --> 02:03:29.377]  Because the founders knew a bigger body of people is harder to take over and they represent the states.
[02:03:30.615 --> 02:03:32.736]  They've been teaching for 100 years, co-equal.
[02:03:33.876 --> 02:03:35.537]  Legislative, executive, judicial.
[02:03:35.897 --> 02:03:38.618]  That was never taught until about 1910 or so.
[02:03:39.179 --> 02:03:41.840]  And then it didn't become the dominant theme the last 20, 30 years.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.561]  The Congress is above the President.
[02:03:45.121 --> 02:03:47.782]  The Congress is above the legislative.
[02:03:48.183 --> 02:03:49.363]  They're not co-equal.
[02:03:49.943 --> 02:03:53.385]  They are the lawmakers and the purse holders, okay?
[02:03:53.945 --> 02:03:55.526]  The President executes
[02:03:56.306 --> 02:03:56.686]  Things.
[02:03:57.446 --> 02:03:57.846]  That's it.
[02:03:58.327 --> 02:04:04.348]  And the courts look at laws to see if they're constitutional as a check on the Congress and on the President.
[02:04:05.048 --> 02:04:07.449]  So, I don't know how to explain it.
[02:04:07.469 --> 02:04:12.690]  And then the legislative, they approve of the judiciary, so it's a check on them.
[02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:19.112]  It's all about checks and balances, but of the three, the dominant is the Congress, because it's the most diverse.
[02:04:19.132 --> 02:04:19.732]  And I'm going to hold you.
[02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:23.573]  I want to come back and talk to you here, and we'll try to hurry the others that are patiently
[02:04:25.178 --> 02:04:25.578]  Holding.
[02:04:26.679 --> 02:04:27.079]  Oh, no.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.802]  She's still there, but one of the people just hung up, so another person's calling in right now.
[02:04:31.842 --> 02:04:32.643]  We'll take that call.
[02:04:33.063 --> 02:04:38.746]  But I'm going to get to Dustin, Private Jay, talking to Martinez, a lady in the Marine Corps.
[02:04:39.447 --> 02:04:41.128]  Mike is up next after Martinez.
[02:04:41.148 --> 02:04:43.149]  We're going to get to all of you, then Private Jay and others.
[02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:46.371]  But look, just what she said.
[02:04:48.652 --> 02:04:49.753]  They do not read it.
[02:04:50.723 --> 02:04:52.584]  It's just like, yes, I swear an oath to it.
[02:04:53.084 --> 02:04:55.025]  It's there for a reason.
[02:04:55.705 --> 02:04:56.025]  Okay?
[02:04:56.065 --> 02:04:59.147]  And what the president's done is totally illegal.
[02:05:00.127 --> 02:05:01.388]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.428 --> 02:05:06.770]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:11.652]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.033 --> 02:05:12.433]  It's true.
[02:05:12.513 --> 02:05:15.094]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:05:15.314 --> 02:05:17.055]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:17.595 --> 02:05:22.298]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:07:57.243 --> 02:07:58.103]  Others don't.
[02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:05.230]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:07.893]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:16.441]  All right, I want to race through military calls, then I will actually air excerpts of the high treason.
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:19.442]  Foreign espionage against this country.
[02:08:20.022 --> 02:08:28.110]  When you have the President in written letters saying, I don't need Congress to launch wars, I get my authority from the UN, and I take their orders, and I've read the quotes here.
[02:08:28.130 --> 02:08:37.519]  When you have the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman agreeing with that, and the SecDef, Secretary of Defense, telling the Senate Armed Services Committees and others.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:39.860]  That, yeah, no, you have no authority.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.061]  You don't matter.
[02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:54.644]  That isn't just the President crossing the Rubicon and taking dictatorial powers to himself and having Congress pass laws the President can secretly arrest citizens and kill them, and we know Obama asked for that, and Congress gave it to him.
[02:08:54.924 --> 02:08:59.225]  So of course the President's like, well, I'll start arresting reporters then for whistleblowing.
[02:08:59.985 --> 02:09:04.746]  Well, I'll just have my Secretary of Defense come in and tell you that you have no authority.
[02:09:06.493 --> 02:09:08.855]  And those Senators are like, but that's not true, that's illegal.
[02:09:09.416 --> 02:09:10.797]  And then it goes, well that's the way it is!
[02:09:13.459 --> 02:09:20.366]  And we're talking to the military, the ones that listen to the show, who are good men and women, they're calling in going, yeah this sounds pretty bad, this sounds like this isn't right.
[02:09:20.386 --> 02:09:23.509]  I mean, other people in the military aren't reading the Constitution.
[02:09:29.034 --> 02:09:31.396]  Folks, the Constitution is the law.
[02:09:31.536 --> 02:09:32.357]  It's America.
[02:09:34.462 --> 02:09:43.898]  I mean, I've never heard of a country that wasn't some little third world country where a foreign group of corporations put a puppet president in, and then they do things like this, but that's what the New World Order is.
[02:09:44.439 --> 02:09:46.522]  They've done it to third world countries, now they're doing it here.
[02:09:48.103 --> 02:10:05.435]  Now, I was talking to Martinez, was her name, a Marine Sergeant, and she said people are starting to wake up, and I wanted to talk to her more, but she hung up, and I want to thank her for calling in, and thank her for listening to the show, and please keep spreading the word, but I wanted to ask her more questions, but she was on Camp Pendleton, so she might have had to go.
[02:10:06.475 --> 02:10:07.556]  Uh, who's been holding the longest?
[02:10:07.576 --> 02:10:09.656]  We're going to go to Mike, who's U.S.
[02:10:09.736 --> 02:10:09.957]  Army.
[02:10:09.977 --> 02:10:13.278]  Then we're going to go to Private Jay, who's National Guard.
[02:10:13.298 --> 02:10:15.379]  Then we're going to go to Dustin, who's U.S.
[02:10:15.459 --> 02:10:15.719]  Army.
[02:10:15.759 --> 02:10:17.099]  Then John, Joe, and others.
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.300]  We got a lieutenant colonel there.
[02:10:19.921 --> 02:10:23.442]  Let me skip to Joe first, because I want to hear from an officer that I promise we're going to get to.
[02:10:23.462 --> 02:10:27.664]  We heard from a lieutenant colonel, Anthony Schaffer, three days ago, or two days ago, saying it's treason.
[02:10:28.144 --> 02:10:28.684]  It's illegal.
[02:10:29.684 --> 02:10:31.105]  What already happened in Libya is.
[02:10:32.466 --> 02:10:33.926]  Congress is suing the president.
[02:10:34.166 --> 02:10:35.607]  Why not just start impeaching him?
[02:10:36.431 --> 02:10:41.533]  Well, Walter Jones of North Carolina has started that the Senate's concurred with a piece of legislation.
[02:10:41.854 --> 02:10:44.955]  Is it news that the beginning process of impeachment's begun?
[02:10:45.335 --> 02:10:47.256]  No, it's not even in the news.
[02:10:47.816 --> 02:10:53.379]  Let's hear from that Lieutenant Colonel Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:53.419 --> 02:10:55.220]  What's your view on this, Lieutenant Colonel?
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.822]  Alex, I looked at that testimony this morning.
[02:11:00.789 --> 02:11:07.975]  And Secretary of Defense Panetta just made me sick with how he was acting towards Senator Sessions.
[02:11:07.995 --> 02:11:12.778]  When I heard that, I just couldn't even think straight, because he openly defied him.
[02:11:12.858 --> 02:11:15.160]  In fact, Sessions should have ordered him right there.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.782]  He says, that's illegal, and you come to Congress, and that's an order.
[02:11:20.224 --> 02:11:23.686]  And we want to see Congress get more involved in this.
[02:11:24.206 --> 02:11:27.289]  Sure, we'll do our part in the military, but Congress has to get involved.
[02:11:27.309 --> 02:11:28.930]  The Supreme Court has to get involved.
[02:11:29.874 --> 02:11:36.617]  And I know we're doing everything we can to talk to our troops and to see what's going to happen if an illegal order is given.
[02:11:36.637 --> 02:11:46.621]  I myself have already personally defied several illegal orders in my career and nothing happened because it was just a private thing that I did.
[02:11:46.701 --> 02:11:57.866]  But getting other men to go along with you, you know, I do a lot of studying on the partisans back in World War II against the Germans and they most of them ended up getting shot in the head.
[02:11:58.752 --> 02:12:09.738]  So it's just not really a simple thing to just say we're going to defy our orders, although I personally would not carry out a illegal order.
[02:12:09.758 --> 02:12:13.500]  Well, Colonel, if it was done early on, Hitler would have been defeated.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:23.186]  It was by successive approximation, as you know, incrementally, then getting the military to swear an oath to him, not to the Republic, the Weimar Republic, similar to ours.
[02:12:23.686 --> 02:12:24.827]  The issue here is,
[02:12:26.112 --> 02:12:32.237]  It's one thing to say no to a Hitler or a Stalin, because as bad as they were, they were over their country.
[02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:33.559]  They weren't under a foreign power.
[02:12:34.319 --> 02:12:37.222]  With Obama, they said NATO and the UN.
[02:12:37.262 --> 02:12:39.384]  As you said, Colonel, they defied.
[02:12:39.784 --> 02:12:40.565]  Here's the boss.
[02:12:40.825 --> 02:12:41.546]  Here's the senator.
[02:12:41.566 --> 02:12:43.767]  I mean, that's who's got the purse.
[02:12:43.807 --> 02:12:45.029]  That's who declares war.
[02:12:45.409 --> 02:12:51.995]  Here is the chairman of the committee saying, you do know under the Constitution
[02:12:53.379 --> 02:12:55.240]  And under the articles that you're under Congress.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.101]  And they said, no, we're under NATO, we're under the UN.
[02:12:59.141 --> 02:13:00.161]  That's where we get our authority.
[02:13:00.581 --> 02:13:01.901]  And Sessions is like, what?
[02:13:02.702 --> 02:13:04.542]  And they kept saying it and saying it.
[02:13:04.642 --> 02:13:06.443]  As you know, he was defying him.
[02:13:07.423 --> 02:13:10.484]  And Congress has the authority to start arresting these people.
[02:13:11.004 --> 02:13:14.245]  I mean, they don't just have the authority to start impeachment.
[02:13:14.405 --> 02:13:16.445]  And I'm sorry, folks, people are like, arrest them?
[02:13:16.785 --> 02:13:21.426]  What are you supposed to do when they come in and say, I take my orders from a foreign group?
[02:13:22.166 --> 02:13:24.107]  I mean, Colonel, your take on that?
[02:13:24.847 --> 02:13:32.609]  I'm involved in recruiting, and I ask every potential recruit whether they would disobey an unlawful order.
[02:13:32.969 --> 02:13:34.329]  And every one of them has said yes.
[02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:38.799]  They said, what is an unlawful order?
[02:13:39.139 --> 02:13:44.593]  And each service has their own courses they give and their own definition of it, so it's very difficult, but...
[02:13:45.353 --> 02:13:49.935]  The key to me, even during the NDAA, we follow this closely.
[02:13:49.975 --> 02:13:50.856]  We watch the vote.
[02:13:50.896 --> 02:13:54.938]  We watch the way they put in all of the different amendments.
[02:13:55.058 --> 02:13:56.259]  And what did Congress do?
[02:13:56.319 --> 02:13:57.259]  Virtually nothing.
[02:13:57.759 --> 02:14:06.083]  We need Congress to back us up and not just have us be the only ones that are going to try to defy the President or disobey an order.
[02:14:06.324 --> 02:14:11.626]  If we could get Congress more fired up, then we'd be even more apt to go along.
[02:14:11.806 --> 02:14:13.387]  Well, Joe, let me be completely clear.
[02:14:13.427 --> 02:14:14.648]  You've hit the nail on the head here.
[02:14:15.487 --> 02:14:16.807]  Okay, you're right.
[02:14:16.947 --> 02:14:23.209]  I'm asking the military to speak up because the Congress are a bunch of paid-off blackmailed crooks.
[02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:29.650]  Now this is so brazen that they're freaking out and talking about impeachment, so I'm saying we've got to really push them.
[02:14:30.110 --> 02:14:32.930]  And I, quite frankly, I'm looking for sacrificial lambs here.
[02:14:33.291 --> 02:14:38.452]  If it's myself, whatever the case is, you know, politically, whatever, I don't want to be hurt, but this is the way it is.
[02:14:39.652 --> 02:14:40.152]  Obviously,
[02:14:42.273 --> 02:15:07.319]  The only way to supercharge this is for the military to simply... If I was a colonel, I would go to my commanding officer and say, well, here's Congressman Walter Jones reading the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11, that it is a high crime and misdemeanor for the president to launch military actions without congressional approval.
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:08.920]  And then they go through all that.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:16.542]  And then I'd say it goes further, Colonel or General, whoever is above you, it goes further.
[02:15:16.702 --> 02:15:20.723]  As you know, they're saying the authority comes from the UN in these statements.
[02:15:21.663 --> 02:15:22.984]  What is your position on that?
[02:15:23.664 --> 02:15:26.065]  And because we've got to head this off at the pass.
[02:15:26.085 --> 02:15:33.107]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with reading the Constitution and saying my commander in chief is not under the command of the UN.
[02:15:33.127 --> 02:15:37.028]  The president, you know, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:15:37.228 --> 02:15:37.568]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:37.588 --> 02:15:37.848]  Go ahead.
[02:15:38.683 --> 02:15:48.027]  One of the things that I did early on was I refused to salute the United Nations flag, and I also refused to salute Henry Kissinger when he was Secretary of State.
[02:15:48.727 --> 02:15:58.190]  But beside that, I've called my congressman in my own district where my home is, and I've asked for him to put in writing that he supports congressmen.
[02:16:01.195 --> 02:16:02.937]  The Jones Resolution.
[02:16:03.277 --> 02:16:07.843]  I've already found out that there's a bipartisan effort to co-sign that.
[02:16:08.063 --> 02:16:12.408]  They're going to try to move that as quickly as possible, and I'm getting hundreds of copies of that.
[02:16:12.428 --> 02:16:15.772]  I'm going to be passing that out to every member I can get my hands on.
[02:16:16.141 --> 02:16:16.421]  Good.
[02:16:16.541 --> 02:16:16.982]  Beautiful.
[02:16:17.062 --> 02:16:20.646]  And you're absolutely right that it's their job and the American people's job.
[02:16:21.266 --> 02:16:32.457]  It's just that in every case, like with the fall of East Germany or any of it, it ends up being the military that is going to make the decision, if they go into hot tyranny, on whether they succeed or not.
[02:16:33.639 --> 02:16:38.503]  And I mean succeed in launching the Civil War, which the globalists have been making plans for, as you know.
[02:16:39.504 --> 02:16:42.045]  We don't want to be in a civil war with the military and police.
[02:16:42.625 --> 02:16:45.605]  I've seen enough in my life to not be macho and to want to have this fight.
[02:16:46.065 --> 02:16:49.606]  But you know the fight is going to come, and it's a mindless fight.
[02:16:49.886 --> 02:16:54.167]  We need to work with the military and police now to overt this.
[02:16:54.247 --> 02:17:01.949]  I mean, I knew, Colonel, when I went to urban warfare drills 14, 15 years ago, that's when the scales came off my eyes.
[02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:06.289]  And I witnessed, mainly the Marines in most cases, training to occupy U.S.
[02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:08.190]  cities and confiscate firearms of citizens.
[02:17:09.372 --> 02:17:20.503]  And I will tell the military, if they try widespread gun confiscation, it will result in absolute anarchy and huge casualties on both sides.
[02:17:20.784 --> 02:17:22.505]  And I know the military is having that discussion.
[02:17:22.886 --> 02:17:30.934]  I mean, do you have confidence that the military, even with some ridiculous scenario, that they push, will say no to gun confiscation?
[02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:42.784]  I can speak for myself that I would not authorize my men to go and to do it, but I just hope that they're not going to be some of these knuckle-draggers, as you call them.
[02:17:42.804 --> 02:17:48.868]  They just enjoy that kind of thing and don't even think of the consequences of it or the constitutionality of it.
[02:17:50.007 --> 02:18:02.286]  Uh, you know these idiots like Mark Levin, I used to listen to him until he started every day pounding on Ron Paul and he's just a spokesperson for who knows what in this sylvia organization.
[02:18:02.306 --> 02:18:02.907]  They can bring
[02:18:07.890 --> 02:18:11.333]  Let's get them behind all of this and let's get to the Supreme Court.
[02:18:11.393 --> 02:18:15.796]  Why is it so hard to bring a bill to the Supreme Court and decide if something's unconstitutional or not?
[02:18:16.336 --> 02:18:16.857]  I hear you.
[02:18:16.977 --> 02:18:17.878]  God bless you, Colonel.
[02:18:17.898 --> 02:18:18.578]  Stay in touch.
[02:18:18.638 --> 02:18:19.419]  Really good points.
[02:18:20.079 --> 02:18:29.366]  I know I talked to a lot of military, including Brass, who's upset and concerned, and I know a bunch of the last Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman, the last two rounds, they kept saying no to all this.
[02:18:30.266 --> 02:18:31.007]  And no to Bush.
[02:18:31.628 --> 02:18:47.683]  Obama, because he's, quote, liberal, has gotten so much through arresting reporters, charging them, you know, under the Espionage Act for whistleblowers, exposing corruption and bid rigging and crimes and shipping guns into Mexico.
[02:18:47.703 --> 02:18:49.625]  All right, Mike in New York, get started.
[02:18:49.645 --> 02:18:50.766]  We'll come back to you after the break.
[02:18:51.267 --> 02:18:51.787]  He's U.S.
[02:18:51.847 --> 02:18:52.047]  Army.
[02:18:52.087 --> 02:18:52.968]  Thanks for holding, Mike.
[02:18:52.988 --> 02:18:53.329]  Go ahead.
[02:18:54.161 --> 02:18:54.501]  How you doing?
[02:18:54.521 --> 02:18:55.242]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:18:55.322 --> 02:18:57.042]  It's great to hear from you and stuff like that.
[02:18:57.383 --> 02:19:06.827]  I think one of the things, I think Ron Paul could be a great candidate for President of the United States, but I think a lot of people in the black communities and Latino communities don't really know who Ron Paul is.
[02:19:06.927 --> 02:19:14.231]  I think they think he's a racist, which we know, we all know it's not true, but they don't really know he sticks up for the Constitution, that he helps everyone.
[02:19:14.251 --> 02:19:19.794]  I think people, because when I talk to other soldiers and stuff like that, black people and stuff, they think Ron Paul is a racist.
[02:19:20.475 --> 02:19:35.051]  Sure, sure, but specifically on the Ron Paul front, yeah, just because politicians promote and say they care about some racial group or another, that's all talk.
[02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:36.933]  The Constitution is what everybody gets.
[02:19:37.534 --> 02:19:40.277]  I mean, we had a caller yesterday point out, I'm not bashing women here, but
[02:19:41.328 --> 02:19:44.870]  The court systems are geared towards women and against men in family rights.
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:49.011]  There's all sorts of discrimination out there that isn't about religion or race.
[02:19:49.551 --> 02:19:50.572]  Most of it's economic.
[02:19:50.752 --> 02:19:51.012]  You know what?
[02:19:51.052 --> 02:19:51.392]  Stay there.
[02:19:51.412 --> 02:19:55.574]  I want to come back to get your take, though, as a military person, on this.
[02:19:56.194 --> 02:19:57.775]  Because this is the big enchilada.
[02:19:57.815 --> 02:19:58.995]  This is a foreign coup.
[02:19:59.256 --> 02:19:59.836]  Do you hear me?
[02:20:03.424 --> 02:20:08.167]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:20:08.607 --> 02:20:10.329]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:13.671]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:20:13.991 --> 02:20:21.176]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:20:21.476 --> 02:20:25.699]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:20:25.979 --> 02:20:31.723]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:20:32.043 --> 02:20:33.624]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:20:33.845 --> 02:20:39.849]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[02:20:49.477 --> 02:20:54.941]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:20:55.201 --> 02:20:58.144]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.

[02:23:44.595 --> 02:23:45.837]  Get seeds .net.
[02:23:45.857 --> 02:23:46.759]  Or call us at 877-341-GROW.
[02:23:46.839 --> 02:23:47.239]  That's 877-341-4769.
[02:23:47.259 --> 02:23:48.141]  Get seeds .net.
[02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:11.848]  Alright, let's hurry to your calls now, because I've got to actually get to the audio and video of the treason, of the foreign coup in front of everyone.
[02:24:13.629 --> 02:24:19.715]  And then all this other news I haven't even gotten to yet, but finishing up with Micah New York, who's U.S.
[02:24:19.815 --> 02:24:20.095]  Army.
[02:24:20.115 --> 02:24:31.705]  I understand you're bringing up Ron Paul, but shifting into what we're discussing here, what do you think of the President, the SecDef, all of them saying, not just that the President is a dictator, basically,
[02:24:32.805 --> 02:24:35.946]  But that he takes his orders from foreign powers.
[02:24:35.986 --> 02:24:36.906]  What's your view on that?
[02:24:38.166 --> 02:24:39.027]  I think it's a shame.
[02:24:39.067 --> 02:24:40.067]  I think it's terrible.
[02:24:40.327 --> 02:24:45.248]  He's not really our president because you're supposed to uphold the Constitution.
[02:24:45.288 --> 02:24:46.268]  That's your job.
[02:24:46.468 --> 02:24:48.069]  Your job is not to work for the U.N.
[02:24:48.189 --> 02:24:52.770]  or NATO or anybody else or JPMorgan or Rothschild or anybody else.
[02:24:52.810 --> 02:24:55.051]  Your job is to uphold and defend the Constitution.
[02:24:55.091 --> 02:24:55.471]  That's right.
[02:24:56.616 --> 02:25:01.937]  That's right, and we're so trained to think of a foreign power, you know, some dictator like Mussolini that we're fighting.
[02:25:01.977 --> 02:25:07.199]  It's, you know, it's banks, it's these mega-corporations that, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:07.559 --> 02:25:13.680]  We have got to tell Congress, in fact this is my message that I'm going to give them today, I'm going to call on myself today.
[02:25:14.121 --> 02:25:19.282]  Not that it's superpower that I call them, it's just that I don't just talk the talk I walk the walk.
[02:25:21.323 --> 02:25:36.406]  When I call him, I'm gonna say, listen, this is treason, it's a foreign coup, openly announced, it's illegal, and anybody that doesn't sign on to the bill to start the impeachment process is aiding and abetting.
[02:25:37.046 --> 02:25:49.348]  If somebody robs a bank, and they're coming along through your farm, and you say, hey, come on in here, stay with me, just give me some of the money, you're now just as guilty of aiding and abetting as the guy that robbed the bank.
[02:25:50.008 --> 02:25:50.648]  You are guilty.
[02:25:51.658 --> 02:25:53.239]  So, you better choose what side you're on.
[02:25:53.259 --> 02:25:56.260]  This isn't going to go like Germany, where the authoritarians win.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.481]  Let me tell you something, we're going to stomp the New World Order.
[02:25:59.382 --> 02:26:02.343]  They're going to go a lot further before it implodes, but we're going to beat them.
[02:26:04.504 --> 02:26:06.045]  Alright, who's been holding the longest next?
[02:26:06.105 --> 02:26:11.948]  Let's go to Jay, and then Dustin, and then John, and then Joshua, and then that'll be it for calls from the military.
[02:26:12.328 --> 02:26:16.830]  Got a Major calling in, a Captain, and I'm going to go to the folks in order here real fast.
[02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:19.832]  Let's go to Private Jay, National Guard from Texas.
[02:26:19.852 --> 02:26:20.232]  Go ahead.
[02:26:21.718 --> 02:26:22.838]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:26:23.398 --> 02:26:25.539]  Man, I tell you, I'm just like the Colonel earlier.
[02:26:25.859 --> 02:26:27.499]  I literally could hardly talk this morning.
[02:26:27.539 --> 02:26:28.400]  I have a huge headache.
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.220]  And I'm having to argue with my wife about not leaving the United States.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:33.601]  I mean, I'm freaked out.
[02:26:33.641 --> 02:26:34.701]  We're in trouble, okay?
[02:26:35.141 --> 02:26:36.821]  We're in trouble!
[02:26:37.061 --> 02:26:41.322]  After watching that video, I got so upset I was shaking.
[02:26:42.063 --> 02:26:46.103]  I was looking at that, just thinking, okay, so what's the next step?
[02:26:46.123 --> 02:26:46.704]  The U.N.
[02:26:46.724 --> 02:26:48.264]  is going to start appointing our president?
[02:26:49.039 --> 02:26:49.119]  Yeah.
[02:27:06.755 --> 02:27:11.197]  That people just don't understand what our country was founded on.
[02:27:12.037 --> 02:27:19.000]  You know, I do not understand why Congress is even sitting there not doing a dang thing.
[02:27:20.370 --> 02:27:22.611]  Well, because they're insider trading.
[02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:23.331]  They're playing golf.
[02:27:23.351 --> 02:27:24.411]  They're having fun.
[02:27:24.891 --> 02:27:28.032]  I think they're starting to get, though, that, you mean, we're going to lose our power, too?
[02:27:28.473 --> 02:27:37.315]  Yeah, you can't just rubber stamp and hand it over to the National Security Council that's all a bunch of avowed globalists and then not expect to totally be turned into a rubber stamp.
[02:27:37.415 --> 02:27:38.776]  And then they're not even a rubber stamp.
[02:27:39.656 --> 02:27:41.957]  They're told, you have no bearing on us.
[02:27:42.757 --> 02:27:48.679]  And not only is the president a dictator, he is a minion of these foreign consortiums.
[02:27:50.302 --> 02:27:51.483]  So how far is it going to take it?
[02:27:51.603 --> 02:27:54.564]  I mean, are they going to go ahead and just go, alright, U.N.
[02:27:55.025 --> 02:27:56.425]  President takes the orders from the U.N.
[02:27:57.046 --> 02:28:00.768]  Congress is no longer... 80 plus percent of the laws in the U.K.
[02:28:00.788 --> 02:28:01.888]  are now made by the E.U.
[02:28:01.908 --> 02:28:04.150]  bureaucracy, and the countries in the E.U.
[02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:05.110]  make no of the laws.
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:09.413]  They have no control, and they publicly admit there's no more European countries.
[02:28:09.453 --> 02:28:13.615]  They've been absorbed through the design collapse of the E.U.
[02:28:14.956 --> 02:28:18.678]  Are you going to spread the word to your associates in the military, sir?
[02:28:19.724 --> 02:28:20.304]  Roger that.
[02:28:20.344 --> 02:28:22.986]  I'll go ahead and do what I can, when I can.
[02:28:23.166 --> 02:28:27.889]  I'll go ahead and go over what an unlawful order is to people that are above me.
[02:28:28.089 --> 02:28:33.933]  I even talk to majors, lieutenant colonels, and things like that, just to go ahead and explain to them sometimes what's going on.
[02:28:34.633 --> 02:28:39.236]  Someone will be like, ah, DOD isn't that much concerned with it.
[02:28:39.296 --> 02:28:40.657]  They won't take it that far.
[02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:42.498]  They won't do this with it.
[02:28:44.936 --> 02:28:50.658]  Oh, the president wants the power to secretly arrest citizens and put bags over their heads and kill them, but he just wants it.
[02:28:50.698 --> 02:28:51.518]  He's not going to use it.
[02:28:52.419 --> 02:28:55.140]  Oh, billions for 30,000 drones over the U.S.
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:59.261]  Oh, yeah, they're on the news saying they want to put lithium in the water, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:28:59.601 --> 02:29:02.283]  Yeah, they're announcing world government, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:29:02.623 --> 02:29:05.564]  Yeah, they're training for gun confiscation, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:29:06.044 --> 02:29:08.005]  Oh, they're never going to pass socialist health care.
[02:29:08.465 --> 02:29:09.385]  Oh, they're never going to.
[02:29:09.505 --> 02:29:10.346]  Oh, they're, exactly.
[02:29:10.386 --> 02:29:10.926]  God bless you.
[02:29:10.946 --> 02:29:13.007]  All right, long segment coming up, and I'm going right.
[02:29:14.062 --> 02:29:21.732]  To John, who's a captain, and Joshua, who is a major, and then Dustin.
[02:29:22.192 --> 02:29:24.996]  I got more military calling in, but that's probably all I can get to because
[02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:30.080]  See, this show isn't an act, folks.
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:31.320]  I really am concerned.
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:32.961]  I mean, this is all real.
[02:29:33.781 --> 02:29:37.163]  I've warned about all this coming because I read globalist documents years ago.
[02:29:37.683 --> 02:29:38.643]  And now it's here.
[02:29:39.824 --> 02:29:40.204]  It's here.
[02:29:40.244 --> 02:29:43.385]  And I realize they don't want to just get rid of the Bill of Rights because they just want to get rid of it.
[02:29:43.706 --> 02:29:45.006]  They want to enslave us.
[02:29:45.746 --> 02:29:47.307]  They're going to... Do you understand that?
[02:29:49.368 --> 02:29:50.268]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.769 --> 02:29:52.369]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.290 --> 02:29:55.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:07.021]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:30:07.261 --> 02:30:24.891]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:25.152 --> 02:30:29.274]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:30:29.534 --> 02:30:31.115]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:30:31.315 --> 02:30:39.161]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:30:39.481 --> 02:30:45.605]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:30:45.785 --> 02:30:46.846]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:30:47.066 --> 02:30:47.806]  It's incredible.
[02:30:47.946 --> 02:30:56.992]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:30:57.153 --> 02:30:58.994]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:30:59.734 --> 02:31:03.958]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.278 --> 02:31:04.899]  Number one.
[02:31:05.199 --> 02:31:08.342]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.622 --> 02:31:09.183]  Number two.
[02:31:09.483 --> 02:31:14.027]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.367 --> 02:31:14.828]  It's true.
[02:31:15.108 --> 02:31:19.652]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:19.972 --> 02:31:20.512]  Number 3.
[02:31:20.793 --> 02:31:24.075]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:28.138]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.298 --> 02:31:28.838]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.098 --> 02:31:31.460]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:35.203]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.523 --> 02:31:40.225]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.466 --> 02:31:45.228]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:45.528 --> 02:31:49.550]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:49.690 --> 02:31:51.251]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.471 --> 02:31:56.073]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:07.325]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:07.605 --> 02:32:08.966]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:09.147 --> 02:32:17.935]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:18.656 --> 02:32:25.761]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:26.181 --> 02:32:33.806]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:34.186 --> 02:32:39.109]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:41.590]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:44.352 --> 02:32:47.277]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:32:47.577 --> 02:32:49.761]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:49.821 --> 02:32:52.065]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:33:31.170 --> 02:33:39.991]  Alright, we are back alive here, and again, we've just become accustomed with them warrantlessly spying on us.
[02:33:40.671 --> 02:33:43.092]  The Fed's completely out of their jurisdiction.
[02:33:44.941 --> 02:33:53.825]  All of these horrible things happening that we've seen happen in other nations over and over again, and now it's happening here in our constitutional republic.
[02:33:56.206 --> 02:34:01.688]  And no country would put up with people putting you through body scanners and actually grabbing your genitals.
[02:34:01.788 --> 02:34:03.309]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:34:03.849 --> 02:34:13.573]  And not even horrible third world cesspits will put up with their governments openly being puppets of foreign corporate powers or governmental powers.
[02:34:15.231 --> 02:34:17.373]  Is there nothing Americans won't put up with?
[02:34:17.633 --> 02:34:21.156]  That's why they've had all the U.S.A.
[02:34:21.216 --> 02:34:29.504]  beauty queens and all the Miss Americas and all these contestants on game shows promote global government, promote the U.N.
[02:34:29.904 --> 02:34:32.206]  It's just meant to hammer us over and over again.
[02:34:32.587 --> 02:34:35.089]  Kids can't even say U.S.A., U.S.A.
[02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:39.373]  at a basketball game in San Antonio against a local team.
[02:34:42.372 --> 02:34:43.974]  Because I guess that's racist now.
[02:34:44.175 --> 02:34:46.398]  It wasn't even meant to be towards a race.
[02:34:48.221 --> 02:34:51.506]  But all these wars were told are launched for America, but they're not.
[02:34:51.546 --> 02:34:57.655]  Now I want to go to a couple more calls and move quick, because you know I'm long-winded, but I want to go to...
[02:35:00.819 --> 02:35:04.802]  John, who is a Army Captain, and then Joshua, who's a Major.
[02:35:05.383 --> 02:35:08.585]  We got a bunch of other people calling in, but I've got to get to some of this other news.
[02:35:08.625 --> 02:35:11.487]  I know I spent almost the entire show on this, and we should.
[02:35:12.028 --> 02:35:14.029]  But there's all this other news that ties into it.
[02:35:14.109 --> 02:35:15.830]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:35:17.412 --> 02:35:22.455]  Police all over the country are pulling people over and grabbing their cell phones and downloading the contents without warrants.
[02:35:22.856 --> 02:35:26.839]  Police give a direct line to cell phone searches, CBS News.
[02:35:29.235 --> 02:35:32.399]  China copies the NDAA to secretly arrest people.
[02:35:32.539 --> 02:35:37.404]  I mean, it's just... Here's a Wired Magazine headline.
[02:35:37.765 --> 02:35:40.688]  Uncle Sam, if it ends in com, it's seizable.
[02:35:40.808 --> 02:35:44.553]  Without warrants, without rulings, just take whatever they want.
[02:35:44.633 --> 02:35:45.554]  I mean, it's crazy!
[02:35:48.211 --> 02:35:52.373]  Obama uses staged cyber attack to sell draconian cyber security bill.
[02:35:52.414 --> 02:35:53.654]  That's Infowars.com.
[02:35:53.674 --> 02:35:58.357]  Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking Panetta testimony that I want to play some of.
[02:35:58.777 --> 02:36:00.078]  DHS mission creep.
[02:36:00.498 --> 02:36:02.700]  They are now helping arrest prostitutes.
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:08.523]  Breitbart's death needs to be investigated for the sake and safety of all journalists.
[02:36:09.644 --> 02:36:13.366]  TSA admits $1 million body scanner system is critically flawed.
[02:36:15.697 --> 02:36:18.659]  Report, chance of catastrophic solar storm is one in eight.
[02:36:21.321 --> 02:36:25.345]  Panetta, international permission, Trump's congressional permission for military actions.
[02:36:26.005 --> 02:36:26.926]  He doesn't even say that.
[02:36:26.966 --> 02:36:29.928]  He said, I don't need, Congress isn't involved anymore.
[02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:35.032]  Let's go to the captain and then the major.
[02:36:36.073 --> 02:36:39.156]  John in Missouri, Army captain, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:36:40.162 --> 02:36:41.503]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[02:36:41.803 --> 02:36:43.204]  It's important that you know the difference.
[02:36:43.224 --> 02:36:47.547]  There's a huge difference between National Guard soldiers and regular Army soldiers.
[02:36:47.968 --> 02:36:55.233]  But more importantly, it's important that you're putting the onus on the wrong person, because it's not the Army's job to police the Congress and the President.
[02:36:55.854 --> 02:37:01.458]  The Congress, that's their job, so they're not having their authority, and then it's the American people's job.
[02:37:02.834 --> 02:37:08.277]  Well, let me agree but also disagree with you.
[02:37:08.317 --> 02:37:11.219]  Listen, I've read the Constitution over and over again.
[02:37:11.239 --> 02:37:15.642]  I've read the manuals the military has given on the question of unlawful orders.
[02:37:16.543 --> 02:37:20.885]  It is always in the final equation when tyranny comes in
[02:37:21.966 --> 02:37:27.368]  It is people in uniform that are the absolute final check on that, along with armed citizens.
[02:37:27.428 --> 02:37:42.712]  So, before the civil war starts, because that's what happens during these type of deals, I'm saying for the military to speak out and say, I don't take my orders through the President from the UN or NATO, as the SecDef and as Obama has now said.
[02:37:42.752 --> 02:37:45.473]  I mean, clearly that's a big issue for the military.
[02:37:46.053 --> 02:37:50.515]  That's an unlawful order if he says go into Syria and Congress hasn't authorized it.
[02:37:50.555 --> 02:37:51.395]  I mean, is that not true?
[02:37:52.984 --> 02:37:56.207]  Well, that's for them to decide, but no one's sending us into Syria, Alex.
[02:37:56.407 --> 02:37:57.548]  You're getting people worked up.
[02:37:57.989 --> 02:38:03.114]  We don't need to do that because we're such a long ways away from confiscating guns.
[02:38:04.615 --> 02:38:05.996]  Do you think you're a swine?
[02:38:06.056 --> 02:38:06.437]  Oh, wait.
[02:38:06.537 --> 02:38:08.599]  Oh, if people get worked up, the gun's got to be taken?
[02:38:08.619 --> 02:38:10.901]  No, I don't think they will, though.
[02:38:11.001 --> 02:38:12.783]  They won't ever get to that point, Alex.
[02:38:12.823 --> 02:38:16.847]  Have you thought about, Captain, what's going to happen if you actually try to confiscate the guns?
[02:38:18.018 --> 02:38:24.402]  Yeah, I mean, I won't do that, but no one's going to order me or my company to go confiscate people's guns.
[02:38:24.422 --> 02:38:25.943]  That didn't happen in New Orleans?
[02:38:25.983 --> 02:38:27.904]  They didn't train for that in Arcadia, Iowa?
[02:38:28.865 --> 02:38:31.146]  That's not regular Army, that's in the National Guard.
[02:38:31.166 --> 02:38:31.586]  You're right.
[02:38:31.926 --> 02:38:33.647]  Well, they did have some regular Army, actually.
[02:38:33.848 --> 02:38:35.308]  They had big Army in New Orleans.
[02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:41.012]  Right, but the big Army and National Guard, they're under two different records, too.
[02:38:41.292 --> 02:38:42.573]  There's huge differences.
[02:38:43.112 --> 02:38:46.514]  And the National, when the regular Army was in New Orleans, we didn't have any weapons.
[02:38:46.954 --> 02:38:48.015]  That's the National Guard Troops.
[02:38:48.035 --> 02:38:48.775]  There's a big difference.
[02:38:48.795 --> 02:38:49.976]  We just wear the same uniform.
[02:38:50.056 --> 02:38:50.896]  People think we're the same.
[02:38:51.136 --> 02:38:59.801]  Well, sir, all I'm trying to say to you is, when the President starts saying, and the Secretary of Defense starts saying, Congress is like, you get your authority from us.
[02:38:59.821 --> 02:39:03.963]  They're like, no, we get it from the UN and NATO.
[02:39:05.103 --> 02:39:06.004]  And they're like, no you don't.
[02:39:06.564 --> 02:39:09.225]  I mean, look, Congress is moving to start impeachment now.
[02:39:09.546 --> 02:39:11.167]  And you notice it's not getting any attention.
[02:39:11.687 --> 02:39:14.929]  Legislation is now being introduced in the House and Senate to begin impeachment.
[02:39:15.189 --> 02:39:18.731]  So you're right, it's their job and it's my job, just as much as it's your job.
[02:39:18.751 --> 02:39:22.653]  But you're a citizen first, and then in the military second.
[02:39:23.294 --> 02:39:25.275]  And I know you're an officer, so you know all that stuff.
[02:39:25.295 --> 02:39:32.899]  Maybe you disagree with the current teaching you're being given, but I've looked at the full... I mean, have you read the manuals on unlawful orders from 100 years ago?
[02:39:34.542 --> 02:39:48.395]  I've seen them Alex, we get classes, but if a soldier, I mean you're telling soldiers to get on there and do things that may get them kicked out of the army, and the reality is, if we get, if they get kicked out of the army, they're going to get a dishonorable discharge, and their whole life's going to be ruined.
[02:39:48.756 --> 02:39:52.980]  So it's just disingenuous to say you're going to go tell the colonel this and this, because you're not in the army.
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:56.003]  And yeah, there's huge consequences that are going to go with this.
[02:39:56.023 --> 02:39:56.964]  Let me stop you again.
[02:39:57.384 --> 02:39:58.988]  I said people should do what they think.
[02:39:59.428 --> 02:40:04.098]  But if, again, the military is supposed to be talking to each other.
[02:40:04.379 --> 02:40:06.363]  You're supposed to be discussing all this.
[02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:07.445]  Listen!
[02:40:08.410 --> 02:40:10.772]  You say you're going to get thrown out of the army, you're going to get in trouble.
[02:40:11.092 --> 02:40:12.153]  It wasn't disingenuous.
[02:40:12.314 --> 02:40:14.656]  I said in this tyranny you could get in trouble.
[02:40:15.336 --> 02:40:18.039]  What, you don't think I don't have my butt hanging out over the side here?
[02:40:18.479 --> 02:40:21.782]  I don't even talk about the chicanery that goes on against us.
[02:40:23.063 --> 02:40:26.687]  You think it's safe to get on the air and tell the military to start... Listen, listen.
[02:40:27.207 --> 02:40:28.548]  See how we've gotten comfortable with this?
[02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:32.411]  It's illegal to have the president launching wars without congressional approval.
[02:40:32.971 --> 02:40:33.211]  Okay?
[02:40:33.271 --> 02:40:37.254]  I had Colonel Schaefer on just a few days ago saying, yes, it's illegal.
[02:40:37.534 --> 02:40:38.294]  Yes, it's treason.
[02:40:38.395 --> 02:40:39.795]  Because the code says it is.
[02:40:40.116 --> 02:40:41.516]  The Constitution says it.
[02:40:41.857 --> 02:40:44.158]  I got Walter Jones saying it's a high crime.
[02:40:44.418 --> 02:40:46.099]  It is a high crime, Captain.
[02:40:46.459 --> 02:40:47.340]  It is a high crime.
[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:48.180]  And you know what?
[02:40:48.441 --> 02:40:53.824]  At the end of the day, I'm asking the citizens, I'm asking the military, I'm asking the Congress, everybody.
[02:40:53.884 --> 02:40:55.705]  Listen, so you disagree?
[02:40:55.805 --> 02:40:56.966]  Do you think I'm blowing this up?
[02:40:57.466 --> 02:41:06.707]  That I am saying that this is basically the beginning of a foreign coup to have wars launched under UN orders as Obama said last year and as Panetta said yesterday.
[02:41:08.121 --> 02:41:13.364]  Alex, no one is telling the United States Army, no one's telling me or mine, I'm the commander of my company.
[02:41:14.445 --> 02:41:16.606]  We're not confiscating guns, we're so far from that.
[02:41:16.926 --> 02:41:20.728]  And nobody's sending us into Libya or Syria, they're not sending a regular army there.
[02:41:20.988 --> 02:41:27.832]  You can see where we're on, they have a chart all on Army times where every unit in the United States Army is located.
[02:41:27.992 --> 02:41:31.034]  Oh, they have a public chart where every unit of the U.S.
[02:41:31.114 --> 02:41:31.534]  Army is at?
[02:41:33.105 --> 02:41:36.447]  Oh, including clandestine units?
[02:41:39.808 --> 02:41:41.929]  But you know there's stuff about black ops, right?
[02:41:42.229 --> 02:41:47.551]  I mean, do you know about... There's private corporate groups with national security letter of marks.
[02:41:54.528 --> 02:41:55.468]  Yeah, I read that.
[02:41:55.488 --> 02:41:56.949]  I listen to you all the time.
[02:41:57.369 --> 02:41:58.550]  I think you're great.
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:25.842]  Well, I think you're great, sir, but do you realize that's illegal?
[02:42:26.922 --> 02:42:35.287]  That's for the common, all of these jobs, we don't, we're run by civilians, we don't, it's not our job to go arrest the President or the Congress, the Congress needs to do their job.
[02:42:35.307 --> 02:42:37.829]  Let me stop you, I hear you and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:42:37.869 --> 02:42:39.470]  Let me be clear, if you think that's what you heard.
[02:42:39.890 --> 02:42:42.011]  I did not say the military should arrest the President.
[02:42:43.672 --> 02:42:46.734]  I'm not in love with this thing I hear about a military coup to stop what's happening.
[02:42:47.074 --> 02:42:49.655]  You know, some Operation Valkyrie, because the President's just a puppet.
[02:42:50.296 --> 02:42:50.596]  Okay?
[02:42:51.781 --> 02:42:59.843]  I'm saying the military needs to make some noise and say, hey, we don't take our orders in the Constitution from the U.N.
[02:43:00.543 --> 02:43:01.583]  like Michael Dew did.
[02:43:04.503 --> 02:43:07.904]  Joshua and OK in Oklahoma, it just says major.
[02:43:08.464 --> 02:43:09.944]  Thanks for calling and holding, Joshua.
[02:43:10.004 --> 02:43:11.345]  You're a major in the Army, Marines.
[02:43:11.365 --> 02:43:11.965]  Were you a major?
[02:43:13.485 --> 02:43:14.685]  Major in the Army, actually.
[02:43:15.205 --> 02:43:17.886]  What did you think of the whole discussion we've been having?
[02:43:19.611 --> 02:43:24.654]  Well, to be honest, focusing on that last one, I'm actually very disappointed in that captain.
[02:43:26.355 --> 02:43:30.118]  My personal beliefs are that he's misguided even though he has good intentions.
[02:43:30.698 --> 02:43:47.990]  Now, going back on something that was stated earlier, he doesn't personally believe that people are going to start confiscating guns or people are going to start arresting citizens whenever they feel like it, but I was actually recently assigned to liaison duty where I'm
[02:43:48.837 --> 02:43:59.121]  Helping people transition from the active military into the Reserves or National Guard for the simple fact that they want to keep their numbers but they don't want to pay them near as much, hence this whole budget cuts thing.
[02:44:01.081 --> 02:44:08.824]  One of the key things that they actually did do was they went around and reassured a lot of people saying things like, oh, don't worry, your job's secure.
[02:44:08.944 --> 02:44:10.165]  Oh, don't worry, we'll give you benefits.
[02:44:10.505 --> 02:44:12.065]  Oh, don't worry, we'll give you a bonus.
[02:44:12.586 --> 02:44:15.026]  If you just do this, you just have to do what we say.
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:23.243]  Going again to something that was stated before, the bouts began being confiscated.
[02:44:24.023 --> 02:44:30.667]  Oklahoma has never been a state that's had armor until recently, and it's not quite something that they're bringing out to the mainstream.
[02:44:31.347 --> 02:44:41.352]  What is happening that I'm aware of, because it's in my department, is recently we were given APCs and we were given strikers.
[02:44:42.361 --> 02:44:46.667]  Usually in the form of things that can be modified, up-armored, whatever.
[02:44:47.247 --> 02:44:48.689]  Bigger guns, things like that.
[02:44:48.769 --> 02:44:51.432]  But the thing is, it's not focused on, like, tanks.
[02:44:52.073 --> 02:44:55.958]  It's not focused on things to declare war.
[02:44:56.038 --> 02:45:01.245]  It's always on stuff where you can move troops in and out of an area where they're completely protected by a hunk of steel.
[02:45:02.441 --> 02:45:07.784]  So it's to fight asymmetrical groups of guerrilla warriors.
[02:45:08.244 --> 02:45:11.245]  It's for fighting asymmetrical insurrections.
[02:45:11.986 --> 02:45:15.147]  And look, the local police are all militarizing for that duty.
[02:45:15.167 --> 02:45:20.710]  I mean, there's a full escalation for over a decade for all-out war with the American people.
[02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:22.771]  And I just hope that this doesn't happen.
[02:45:22.791 --> 02:45:26.933]  But if it does, the public's not going to go out and fight the vehicles when they're driving down the road.
[02:45:26.953 --> 02:45:29.134]  They're going to attack the troops when they're in bars.
[02:45:29.714 --> 02:45:35.876]  I mean, I hope people understand, if it goes to a guerrilla war in this country, it's... I don't know how to explain it, but I'm sure you know.
[02:45:36.296 --> 02:45:36.656]  Go ahead.
[02:45:37.756 --> 02:45:56.101]  Well, no, that's what I was trying to point out, is that one of the things that went down the pipe is they were making comments along the lines, and we had a hearing that said, okay, well, we have to worry about civil insurrection, we have to worry about this, this, and that, and guerrilla warfare was brought up almost every conversation.
[02:45:57.389 --> 02:45:58.310]  So, let me stop you.
[02:45:58.330 --> 02:46:01.572]  You're in charge, as I've had family in charge, until he was sent back overseas.
[02:46:02.113 --> 02:46:26.729]  He's regular army, merging with the National Guard, beefing it up, and the whole clandestine mission, and I was even told this, and I've been told it by a hundred other sources, literally, or more, is for riot control and even combat at arms, and even in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act 2007-08, it says to even suppress states and legislatures and rogue governors, so they create the 10-member Governor Council to say,
[02:46:26.849 --> 02:46:28.070]  Oh, we're for the states.
[02:46:28.110 --> 02:46:29.371]  We have a 10-member council.
[02:46:30.412 --> 02:46:31.973]  This is breaking news here, though, from you.
[02:46:31.993 --> 02:46:33.414]  We have Brigade Homeland articles.
[02:46:33.774 --> 02:46:44.882]  I mean, we know that they're training for this, but you're saying you're being told, here's the armored vehicles, here's the strikers, you know, here's these combat vehicles for guerrilla war.
[02:46:45.262 --> 02:46:46.103]  So, I mean, there it is.
[02:46:46.223 --> 02:46:51.367]  Why is the government gearing up for guerrilla war in Oklahoma and Texas and everywhere else?
[02:46:51.627 --> 02:46:53.709]  Why are they acclimating the public for troops on the streets?
[02:46:54.029 --> 02:47:07.861]  Because foreign usurpers have hijacked the presidency and are telling Congress, sit down and shut up, and we have a foreign coup and they plan on using you against us when they fully implode the country and arrest people like me.
[02:47:08.221 --> 02:47:10.403]  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:47:10.423 --> 02:47:11.364]  I'm going to shut up, Major.
[02:47:12.765 --> 02:47:15.166]  Well, I appreciate that, and no, that's okay.
[02:47:15.686 --> 02:47:17.466]  I'm actually 100% on your page.
[02:47:17.706 --> 02:47:32.450]  In fact, I had recently been through an ordeal, I say recently, it was in 2009, where I refused to obey an order, which I'm not going to go into over the air, but I was incarcerated for 90 days because I refused to obey this order.
[02:47:32.970 --> 02:47:36.391]  However, upon release, I was asked why was I incarcerated.
[02:47:36.431 --> 02:47:37.492]  They never gave me a reason.
[02:47:40.148 --> 02:47:44.211]  And then I was reassigned as a liaison, I guess, so they don't think I can do a whole lot of damage or whatever.
[02:47:44.271 --> 02:47:52.197]  But one of the biggest weapons that I have is the fact that I do have an Oakleaf Cluster, and I have a voice, and I can be heard, just like you, sir.
[02:47:52.237 --> 02:48:03.086]  You can do this, and so can I. And anybody else who doesn't think, oh, well, you know, I have no voice, or says, oh, I can't say this, this, or that, or I can't do this, they're full of it.
[02:48:04.019 --> 02:48:10.185]  Anybody and everybody has the power to stand up and say whatever they need to say, or whatever needs to be said.
[02:48:10.325 --> 02:48:17.652]  Well, again, if we can't stand up now when the President says, I take my orders from the UN, then when will we stand up?
[02:48:17.672 --> 02:48:28.762]  I mean, this is open coup d'etat, but just to be specific, so they're in these meetings where these armored vehicles are being shipped in, and heavier weapons, they're admitting it's for guerrilla warfare in America.
[02:48:29.838 --> 02:48:30.258]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:48:30.298 --> 02:48:31.238]  They're not being shipped in.
[02:48:31.258 --> 02:48:32.318]  They've already been shipped in.
[02:48:32.679 --> 02:48:34.959]  They've been shipped into locations all around the country.
[02:48:35.339 --> 02:48:36.079]  Look at YouTube.
[02:48:36.199 --> 02:48:41.120]  There's several videos where it shows vehicles being brought in on trains.
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:43.100]  Yeah, hundreds of tanks.
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.601]  I know they're being deployed in stockpiles.
[02:48:45.881 --> 02:48:47.561]  I know the caches are there and they're training.
[02:48:47.781 --> 02:48:50.522]  But, I mean, specifically, they just admit this is to fight the guerrillas.
[02:48:51.622 --> 02:48:52.082]  Oh, no, no.
[02:48:52.122 --> 02:48:52.702]  Not just that.
[02:48:52.782 --> 02:48:53.582]  It's for anything.
[02:48:54.382 --> 02:48:57.483]  Texas said, I think it was Rick Perry who basically made a comment
[02:48:58.854 --> 02:49:01.936]  Can't remember exactly when, but he was talking about Texas secession.
[02:49:01.956 --> 02:49:05.438]  When that happened, our command was like, holy crap, maybe go time.
[02:49:06.499 --> 02:49:12.122]  There was another state that said something about secession not too long ago, and then everything started coming down the chain.
[02:49:12.843 --> 02:49:13.443]  You just heard it.
[02:49:13.523 --> 02:49:21.869]  They're telling you get ready to suppress governors that realize we don't have a real federal government and reform the republic from the states up.
[02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:26.131]  Well, they're trying to do something they're not supposed to.
[02:49:26.151 --> 02:49:26.852]  That's for darn sure.
[02:49:27.967 --> 02:49:30.568]  Well, if you have to put it that way, yeah, I guess that would be the case, but I guess
[02:49:47.170 --> 02:49:52.231]  Labeled as a traitor a long time ago because I have a brain and a voice and I like to speak.
[02:49:52.591 --> 02:50:02.653]  Any other tidbits about people being awake around you or specifically, I mean, just ballpark, how many armored vehicles are in Oklahoma for the American people in the legislature?
[02:50:03.793 --> 02:50:06.814]  Okay, well, I don't know all the numbers.
[02:50:06.954 --> 02:50:10.615]  I do know for my area, there was recently brought in six.
[02:50:10.675 --> 02:50:15.036]  In fact, I have pictures on my cell phone from which they were being brought in.
[02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:21.371]  There, let's see, there were six Strikers and about nine Bradleys.
[02:50:23.692 --> 02:50:25.232]  Which they used at Wacom.
[02:50:26.132 --> 02:50:26.833]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:28.553 --> 02:50:30.874]  But other than that, that's just my area.
[02:50:31.914 --> 02:50:38.316]  There's others that have been brought in and that I don't know about, supposedly, that are in Fort Sill right now.
[02:50:38.336 --> 02:50:41.517]  And then there's others that were taken in Oklahoma City.
[02:50:44.017 --> 02:50:46.258]  And they admit to you that this could be for
[02:50:48.015 --> 02:50:54.542]  Wow, I mean, you're saying when states talk about secession, the chain of command says, get ready, get ready to go into the states.
[02:50:55.102 --> 02:50:57.425]  Well, remember the feds said they'd do a blockade over Texas.
[02:50:57.805 --> 02:50:59.206]  Stay there, we've got to come back to you and then others.
[02:51:00.774 --> 02:51:07.618]  2012 is finally here, and while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[02:51:08.078 --> 02:51:12.300]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:22.545]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns, or are receiving threatening letters or phone calls, call the Tax Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.

[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:11.962]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.

[02:54:09.378 --> 02:54:09.758]  All right.
[02:54:14.183 --> 02:54:20.929]  Everybody is going to wish they'd done more to say no to corruption.
[02:54:22.651 --> 02:54:30.558]  Because I wish I knew 15 years ago that I was so accurate and so right and that it was worse than I even thought.
[02:54:31.099 --> 02:54:32.100]  I wish I would have done more.
[02:54:33.168 --> 02:54:35.250]  Because they got really bad plans for this country.
[02:54:35.310 --> 02:54:36.290]  I've broken it down.
[02:54:36.370 --> 02:54:37.792]  I've researched it from every angle.
[02:54:38.292 --> 02:54:41.274]  They're planning to completely shut the economy off.
[02:54:42.455 --> 02:54:44.557]  And just arrest people, everything.
[02:54:44.677 --> 02:54:46.758]  And a lot of folks are like, I know, I'm gonna cower.
[02:54:47.339 --> 02:54:48.520]  Well, that's how they win.
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:49.861]  We can't just do this.
[02:54:50.761 --> 02:54:52.963]  And, you know, the money's all racing out of the country.
[02:54:53.263 --> 02:54:58.988]  The people that help do this, the people that help sell us down the river, they're all just exiting as fast as they can for years.
[02:55:01.328 --> 02:55:02.329]  How about we just wake up?
[02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:25.252]  How about we virally spread the news, this is illegitimate, and say no, and call Congress, and say yes, impeach Obama, yes, yes, we're not under the UN, you know, Ron Paul has tried, and he's educated a lot of people, but I told you there's election fraud, and there's these articles in Politico, like, Ron Paul's advisors don't know why they're not winning, because you're being cheated!
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:33.562]  But going back to Joshua, and then we'll go to Dustin, and then that's it for calls.
[02:55:33.602 --> 02:55:36.523]  And I didn't even get to most of the other news, because this is just such big stuff.
[02:55:37.164 --> 02:55:39.345]  But everything else I had tied into it, I'll be covering tonight.
[02:55:39.365 --> 02:55:41.185]  Seven o'clock's gonna be a huge news show tonight.
[02:55:43.226 --> 02:55:47.208]  Going back to Joshua, and then to Dustin, who's been holding for like an hour, U.S.
[02:55:47.288 --> 02:55:47.548]  Army.
[02:55:48.689 --> 02:55:50.530]  Joshua's a major in the U.S.
[02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.790]  Army.
[02:55:52.606 --> 02:55:54.067]  I was jumping in and hyperventilating.
[02:55:54.407 --> 02:56:02.912]  Specifically though, tell us about what they do whenever a state talks about secession, what the brigade homeland kicks into.
[02:56:04.733 --> 02:56:20.582]  Well, the last time that somebody said anything about secession, I remember being at home and I got an email, a phone call, a text message, pretty much all at the same time, being, get your crap, get ready to go, we're going to have to meet up with the colonel and
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:27.322]  Uh, so I did, uh, my buddy and I were like, okay, what's going on?
[02:56:27.382 --> 02:56:27.822]  It's okay.
[02:56:27.842 --> 02:56:29.282]  We're, we're going to have to get ready.
[02:56:29.682 --> 02:56:30.742]  There's talk of secession.
[02:56:30.762 --> 02:56:33.543]  We need to see what happens because if this happens, it's go time.
[02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:41.165]  And I remember a, uh, a young lieutenant looking back actually, who made the comment, yeah, it's about time.
[02:56:41.185 --> 02:56:43.226]  Finally, we start showing people who's boss.
[02:56:43.246 --> 02:56:44.826]  And it's like, are you freaking kidding me?
[02:56:46.294 --> 02:56:51.719]  But that's actually... Now let's be clear, because this is actually in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[02:56:51.779 --> 02:56:55.322]  It says insurrection by the population, the states, or legislatures.
[02:56:55.843 --> 02:56:57.564]  Well, the states have a right to secede.
[02:56:58.805 --> 02:57:03.950]  I mean, that's on record in many state constitutions, but it's also there in the common law.
[02:57:04.250 --> 02:57:05.391]  That's what happened with the colonies.
[02:57:05.812 --> 02:57:10.175]  But Perry just did that for political effect, and you're saying you're in Oklahoma
[02:57:11.010 --> 02:57:11.570]  Bingo!
[02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:13.031]  Actually, it's not just me, it was
[02:57:39.241 --> 02:57:41.582]  National Guard was ready to move to the border.
[02:57:41.722 --> 02:57:44.123]  Active duty from Fort Sill was ready to move.
[02:57:45.583 --> 02:57:56.867]  I know that we have Tinker Air Force Base here and their bombers were actually put, or not their bombers, but their interceptors were actually put on high alert to prepare for actions if anything were to happen.
[02:57:58.991 --> 02:58:13.122]  Oh man, I gotta just have days with military callers more often than stuff, because you know what, I've got all this data, I know what you're saying is true, because it's in the Defense Act, but imagine, we've got foreign banks openly overthrowing the country.
[02:58:14.944 --> 02:58:15.604]  In control.
[02:58:15.844 --> 02:58:16.625]  They're the traitors.
[02:58:16.665 --> 02:58:18.285]  They're telling Congress you have no authority.
[02:58:18.645 --> 02:58:25.488]  And then if the states ever try to pull out of the fake New World Order and reconstitute the Republic, they're gonna bring the military in.
[02:58:25.568 --> 02:58:26.108]  And you know what?
[02:58:26.669 --> 02:58:31.350]  I say with the TSA, the feds say we'll run blockades with F-16s, no aircraft in Texas.
[02:58:32.211 --> 02:58:33.571]  If you don't let us grab your genitals.
[02:58:33.591 --> 02:58:34.532]  I mean, that was in the news.
[02:58:34.852 --> 02:58:35.472]  I say good!
[02:58:35.852 --> 02:58:36.272]  You know what?
[02:58:36.912 --> 02:58:38.093]  Make them act like a bully.

[03:00:21.476 --> 03:00:29.701]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.801 --> 03:00:34.023]  You know, people hear that liner and they think it's a joke.
[03:00:35.812 --> 03:00:45.598]  Oh, FEMA Region 6, yeah, we're under 10 governors who are federal minions, and they say in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act they'll use the military against the states if they try to secede.
[03:00:46.899 --> 03:00:47.839]  They're going to use force.
[03:00:48.459 --> 03:00:49.120]  Oh, you don't want the TSA?
[03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:50.721]  You're going to kick them out of Texas?
[03:00:50.741 --> 03:00:54.443]  Not going to let them grow up your kids and your state legislators?
[03:00:54.803 --> 03:00:58.926]  We'll run an armed blockade and shoot down aircraft coming into the state.
[03:00:59.766 --> 03:01:00.687]  That's what the feds said.
[03:01:00.887 --> 03:01:02.728]  Because they're not the feds, they're foreign bankers.
[03:01:03.663 --> 03:01:05.524]  And I've been ranting about this for three hours.
[03:01:05.564 --> 03:01:07.385]  We're taking phone calls on Obama.
[03:01:07.405 --> 03:01:09.126]  I never even got to the clips.
[03:01:09.507 --> 03:01:10.948]  They're all on Infowars.com.
[03:01:10.968 --> 03:01:12.869]  Paul Watts has got another big article coming out on this.
[03:01:13.169 --> 03:01:15.210]  We've got to make this the biggest story in America.
[03:01:15.731 --> 03:01:21.454]  With the SecDef and others and the Joint Chiefs and they're telling Congress, you have no authority over anything anymore.
[03:01:21.835 --> 03:01:22.955]  Sit down and shut up.
[03:01:23.235 --> 03:01:24.536]  The UN runs America.
[03:01:24.916 --> 03:01:26.798]  The UN is the commander of the President.
[03:01:27.518 --> 03:01:29.379]  They're like, no, the Constitution says it's Congress.
[03:01:29.399 --> 03:01:30.240]  And they just said, nope!
[03:01:31.337 --> 03:01:34.682]  The generals are all looking at the Senators, going, you don't understand.
[03:01:35.042 --> 03:01:36.104]  We're in charge now.
[03:01:37.826 --> 03:01:38.987]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:39.688 --> 03:01:42.272]  Dustin in Texas, U.S.
[03:01:42.773 --> 03:01:44.976]  Army, what's your view on what you've heard discussed here?
[03:01:46.485 --> 03:01:51.688]  Well, I just want to touch up on what that captain had said earlier, because that kind of struck me the wrong way.
[03:01:52.048 --> 03:01:54.730]  He's probably not even a commander for a combat battalion.
[03:01:54.750 --> 03:01:56.971]  He's not even a company commander for a combat battalion.
[03:01:57.311 --> 03:01:58.952]  I'm assuming, just by the way he was talking.
[03:01:59.413 --> 03:02:03.595]  But if he doesn't think that we, that they're not going to try to use our military to take guns,
[03:02:04.008 --> 03:02:04.708]  We're good to go.
[03:02:18.891 --> 03:02:20.653]  The public respect the military.
[03:02:20.693 --> 03:02:22.514]  They respect us a lot, okay?
[03:02:22.614 --> 03:02:35.847]  And when we speak out about political stuff and stuff that's going on that maybe they're not informed because they get all their news from the two, but if we speak out against that, the public are going to listen to what the military has to say because they do respect us.
[03:02:36.447 --> 03:02:43.073]  And it is our job to protect the citizens, to uphold our Constitution, and to protect our way of life.
[03:02:43.093 --> 03:02:44.615]  And hopefully,
[03:02:45.522 --> 03:03:04.830]  Now, I can only speak from where I'm from, there are not a whole lot of people who are awake in my company, and I'm just going to say that probably because it's infantry, so a lot of them aren't very bright, but there are a few that are awake, and there are a few that are informed, and when they start trying to do the crazy stuff, I'm pretty sure a lot of the military are going to snap out of the trance.
[03:03:05.512 --> 03:03:15.379]  Well, what the globalists are going to do is nuke a city or blow something up and then have some militia commander on TV, you know, who it turns out is a Fed, saying they launched the attack.
[03:03:15.859 --> 03:03:18.441]  And then they're going to attack convoys and domestic operations.
[03:03:18.461 --> 03:03:23.845]  They'll have, it'll be a food convoy helping, you know, some town hit by the terrorists.
[03:03:23.885 --> 03:03:28.768]  And then the militia is going to attack the convoy and there'll be footage of it conveniently.
[03:03:29.249 --> 03:03:33.792]  And then they'll try to show the troops on big screen TVs and, you know, remember what happened.
[03:03:34.472 --> 03:03:36.752]  And, I mean, that's how they run the PSYOPs.
[03:03:36.813 --> 03:03:44.494]  And I just hope the military knows we knew this was all coming, and we warned you, and we don't want to have a war with each other.
[03:03:44.554 --> 03:03:51.455]  We need to recognize the Congress is being told the UN and the foreign banks run America.
[03:03:52.976 --> 03:03:53.796]  And period.
[03:03:54.436 --> 03:03:55.396]  I mean, that's treason.
[03:03:55.476 --> 03:03:56.516]  That's coup d'etat.
[03:03:56.836 --> 03:03:57.777]  It's very simple.
[03:03:58.297 --> 03:03:59.077]  Your take on that?
[03:04:01.812 --> 03:04:06.393]  Well, I mean, you're definitely right on that, but I just wanted to say one more thing.
[03:04:06.513 --> 03:04:09.874]  I got a message to the military, for all the military listeners.
[03:04:10.234 --> 03:04:16.616]  I understand that we're brainwashed to take orders and not ask questions, but it's time that we ask questions and speak out.
[03:04:17.036 --> 03:04:20.557]  There are, I mean, I know where I'm stationed, there are a lot of political activist groups.
[03:04:20.978 --> 03:04:27.439]  You know, of course, they got to meet off post to discuss or, you know, to meet, but there are groups out there.
[03:04:27.479 --> 03:04:29.080]  Just reach out, get involved, because
[03:04:29.739 --> 03:04:34.883]  It's time for everybody, not just the military, but the military, the police... Beautifully said.
[03:04:34.943 --> 03:04:35.603]  Look, look, look.
[03:04:35.683 --> 03:04:38.145]  America has been seized by foreign powers.
[03:04:38.986 --> 03:04:40.827]  The traitors are running the federal government.
[03:04:41.348 --> 03:04:43.709]  Real Americans better stand up and defend the republic.
[03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.830]  Okay, this is it.
[03:04:45.531 --> 03:04:48.313]  I mean, they're telling Congress, foreign powers run America.
[03:04:48.573 --> 03:04:50.995]  Congress, sit down and shut up.
[03:04:52.015 --> 03:04:54.077]  And Congress says, we're going to impeach your hind end.
[03:05:00.871 --> 03:05:05.495]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[03:05:05.796 --> 03:05:14.584]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you
