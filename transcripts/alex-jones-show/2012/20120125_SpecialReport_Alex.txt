[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.511]  Should it be mandatory that all students who attend school be vaccinated?
[00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.251]  That I'm not sure.
[00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.112]  I would say yes.
[00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:08.573]  I would think it's a good thing, but mandatory?
[00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:10.974]  I guess that could, like, violate some people's rights?
[00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:17.557]  No, it shouldn't be mandatory for students to have vaccinations in order to attend public school.
[00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.339]  Uh, no, I don't think it should be mandatory to get vaccinated before attending college.
[00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.060]  I do believe they should be vaccinated.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.681]  I think it should be voluntary.
[00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.242]  Tell us about, you said your sister chooses not to?
[00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:29.719]  Yeah, she's in Portland, Oregon.
[00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.240]  She has three kids that she chooses not to vaccinate.
[00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:37.963]  And she actually, like, actively fights against not vaccinating children, not having it as a requirement.
[00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:40.484]  I think it's always everyone's decision, though.
[00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.665]  I don't think you can force anyone to get vaccinated.
[00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:43.405]  Vaccines?
[00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:44.246]  I don't trust them.
[00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:46.046]  I don't get my flu vaccine.
[00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:47.747]  Interesting development in California.
[00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:53.290]  They just passed a bill legalizing children consent for vaccines, if you could believe it.
[00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.331]  So 12 years old and above,
[00:00:55.751 --> 00:01:02.188]  They can actually consent to vaccinations for Gardasil and Hepatitis B. What are your thoughts on that?
[00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.710]  I think that's a bit early in life to be putting this decision on kids.
[00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.412]  I don't think minors have the ability to make these decisions.
[00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:12.552]  It's up to the parents.
[00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:21.536]  Well, I think children over the age of 12 probably don't have all the mental facilities to make a decision like that on their own.
[00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:23.016]  12 seems a little young.
[00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:26.237]  I don't know how you can make an informed decision when you're 12.
[00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:28.878]  I don't even think I would know anything about vaccinations when I was 12.
[00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.901]  Kids do anything else without parental knowledge.
[00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.822]  Why would they do that?
[00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:35.103]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:37.324]  Parents are responsible for their children.
[00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:41.647]  It should definitely be the parents' choice over the students.
[00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:47.011]  Totally the parents' decision what they do with their children, where they go to school, and what vaccinations they get.
[00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:50.434]  Do you think that any of the vaccines pose a risk?
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.141]  Potentially, yes.
[00:01:52.902 --> 00:02:01.971]  Starting January 1st, California minors as young as 12 years old have the right to get preventative treatment for sexually transmitted diseases without parental permission.
[00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:09.178]  That includes the HPV vaccines Gardasil and Cerevix, which help prevent many strains of cervical cancer.
[00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:13.702]  A group of children are going to go to school who've not had the vaccine and they are going to be shown a film.
[00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:22.630]  And they tell you, children, McNeshka is going to show you this film, and they don't tell them it's sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, but they will show them a film, and it will show the horrors of cervical cancer.
[00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.193]  And those children will be frightened, deliberately frightened, into getting the vaccine.
[00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:30.797]  Don't tell your parents, kids, but you get this vaccine, because this is going to happen to you if you don't get it.
[00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.860]  This is a $50 billion a year industry.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.203]  And it's time that we expose what these merchants of death are doing.
[00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:43.167]  Their vaccines don't work, and they've been linked to killing people and maiming others.
[00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:49.194]  Big Pharma, obviously they're making billions of dollars, so do they have an incentive to push these on the people?
[00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:51.975]  Oh yeah, this is all big business.
[00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:52.615]  More money.
[00:02:54.196 --> 00:03:03.880]  I have my suspicions about pharmaceutical companies influencing political, you know, the same political sway, bills being passed to force people to get vaccines.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.402]  Every piece of information that is in accordance with that vaccine's side effects, I mean,
[00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.420]  The good side effects and the bad side effects.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.842]  Everything should be made public or available to the patient so they know what they're getting themselves into.
[00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:20.663]  I would say do actual research into the drugs instead of hearsay.
[00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:23.944]  You know, you can't force anyone to do anything that they don't want to do.
[00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:27.906]  So, at the end of the day, I don't think you should be forcing that at all.
