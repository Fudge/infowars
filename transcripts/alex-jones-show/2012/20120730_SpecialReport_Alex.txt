[00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:04.517]  Hi, welcome.
[00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:07.598]  I'm Christy Hightower from the Planet InfoWars Ask Alex group.
[00:00:07.718 --> 00:00:08.818]  I'm here with Alex Jones.
[00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:15.420]  We're finishing the last part of the marathon set of questions, so we're going to start off where we left off, which is question 24.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.380]  Okay, so I got through about half of them last time.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.601]  Right.
[00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.981]  We've got to hurry today, so 26 questions in 20 minutes.
[00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.481]  You got it.
[00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:23.322]  Tick, tick, tock.
[00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:23.702]  Okay.
[00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:27.143]  Alex, what are your thoughts on the NSTIC program?
[00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:27.883]  Is it dangerous?
[00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:29.403]  Is it as dangerous as I think?
[00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.024]  And biometric access for the internet, is that required?
[00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:42.278]  That's what governments all over are pushing for to tax you, not just track you, and not just frame you, but also tax you.
[00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:49.164]  And then they're saying if you're not a good little globalist, they're going to ban your internet ID and kick you off the web or blacklist you.
[00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:56.810]  And the architecture under SOPA and ACTA and others has been where there's no judge or jury, they just decide your
[00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.074]  You're engaging in hate speech, or you're engaging in copyright infringement, or you're engaging in whatever the case is, and then you're just banned and blacklisted from the web.
[00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:09.416]  This is a very, very dangerous authoritarian move.
[00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:14.498]  Especially in the 21st century, this is the future, is the internet.
[00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:20.741]  So it's basically a human right to have access to this worldwide web, which the system is trying to curtail and take over.
[00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.282]  Especially with all the activist movements.
[00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.183]  I mean, you need to be able to talk to people.
[00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.082]  Well that's right, the system wants to use the internet to try to create its own revolutions and steer things, but they're not winning, they're losing.
[00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:38.645]  They helped build what is the web today, but the people are what brought all this ingenuity to it and built it up.
[00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.265]  Absolutely.
[00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:46.528]  And so the establishment, the man, is really rethinking the fact that they thought they could dominate the internet.
[00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:48.289]  Too late, genie out of the bottle.
[00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:55.019]  This comes to you from Max, and he says, hey Alex, please cover the Samson option on the show.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.661]  I don't know if you know anything about the Samson option.
[00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:02.503]  Well, I know that, again, I am not given these questions beforehand.
[00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:07.706]  Last week she had 50 questions, only got to 24 of them or so, and I have not looked at these.
[00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:16.050]  I believe the Samson option, from memory, is Israel nuking all of its neighbors if it's attacked.
[00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.134]  Uh, and then they've also called some of the others the Samson, uh, you know, option of, you know, to go ahead and just nuke the whole world and the elite goes underground.
[00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:38.638]  Uh, but, but when I'm, can't remember something exactly, put a star because we should on all the stuff we've starred, just do a piece on that where you go and say, is this what you remember?
[00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:40.759]  I can do that.
[00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.160]  Somebody called in the day about a CFR document and said the name.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.701]  I said, that's a CFR document, isn't it?
[00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:45.601]  They said, yeah.
[00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:51.444]  Then once they said yes, then I could remember that I was accurately thinking of the right federal takeover of society.
[00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:54.045]  But, I mean, what do they say the Samson option is?
[00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:54.806]  They didn't really.
[00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:56.486]  I think they just wanted you to elaborate.
[00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:56.806]  Okay.
[00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:57.287]  Yeah.
[00:02:57.747 --> 00:03:01.449]  We're going to have to have a special edition where we go back to these questions.
[00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.549]  I mean, I could Google it.
[00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.869]  You know what?
[00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.230]  I've just got to see right now.
[00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.911]  I mean, I know I said this is a hurry.
[00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.887]  I mean, it's Israel nuking everybody.
[00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.310]  Very exciting.
[00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.271]  Kind of has the Jeopardy sound.
[00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:26.215]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:36.140]  The Samson option is a term used by various commentators to describe Israel's alleged deterrent strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons as a last resort.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.101]  Oh, Israel doesn't admit they have nukes, so I guess they don't.
[00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:39.562]  Right.
[00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:41.863]  And the government doesn't admit chemtrailing, so it doesn't exist.
[00:03:41.903 --> 00:03:44.284]  Now, Israel has 400 nuclear weapons at least.
[00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:45.465]  I can't see you, you can't see me.
[00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.006]  Their own people have said so.
[00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:57.695]  Commentators also have employed the term in reference to situations where non-nuclear, non-Israel actors such as Saddam Hussein, Yasser Arafat, or Hezbollah have threatened conventional weapons retaliation.
[00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.358]  Samson brought the whole temple down.
[00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:01.899]  You know the story, okay.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.504]  I was correct, but I'm not, I'm not, you know, sure of everything.
[00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:08.505]  I always have to double-check.
[00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:09.006]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:10.596]  Well, one quick thing.
[00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:16.920]  I feel like Max probably could do that, and I'm just sure that maybe we'll hit it back with some other facts that you've got.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.960]  Max could do what?
[00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.162]  The guy that asked the question on the Samson.
[00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:22.523]  Oh, but I mean, what is his specific question?
[00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:23.504]  Hold on one second.
[00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:24.425]  We're going to keep rolling.
[00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:25.725]  My wife is calling.
[00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:27.927]  We'll do this on air now, unedited.
[00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:29.228]  Hey, honey, how you doing?
[00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.810]  I am taping something.
[00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:35.131]  I'm taping the Ask Alex.
[00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:36.012]  I'll be done in about 15 minutes.
[00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:37.533]  Can I call you back, or is it an emergency?
[00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.472]  Yeah, go eat without me.
[00:04:41.492 --> 00:04:42.275]  I'm gonna have to stay late.
[00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:42.616]  I love ya.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.560]  Hi.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.441]  There you go, multitasking.
[00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:47.662]  This is how hard we work here.
[00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:50.123]  Most media outlets like one thing a week, not us.
[00:04:50.143 --> 00:04:51.144]  We're just continuing.
[00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:52.344]  Nope.
[00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.306]  In fact, Chris, can I have a glass of water, please?
[00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:55.666]  Thank you.
[00:04:56.106 --> 00:04:56.406]  No problem.
[00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.587]  All right, let's continue.
[00:04:57.607 --> 00:04:58.828]  I already added too many of those.
[00:04:58.848 --> 00:04:59.708]  Okay.
[00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:00.669]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.829]  Sorry.
[00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:01.409]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.889]  Infowars.
[00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.995]  Brianna asks you, she says, hey Alex, can you cover RFID implementation in the Obamacare bill and discuss if there's anything about non-vaccinating too?
[00:05:13.197 --> 00:05:23.864]  Okay, look, everybody freaked out about a section in the legislation, it's a terrible bill, that said, oh my gosh, it funds putting chips in us.
[00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:29.408]  And it does fund all these medicalized chips and chips of the new pills that are coming out and things.
[00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.669]  So that is there, that is where medicine's going.
[00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.411]  And chips wouldn't be bad to make a blind person see.
[00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:41.115]  The problem is, all tech they put out, they admit, they make you pay for it, Trojan horse back doors are put in.
[00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:48.362]  So, if there was some brain chip to stop Parkinson's or a brain chip to, you know, heal the blind, I'm all for it.
[00:05:48.963 --> 00:05:54.348]  The problem is, for buying and selling, the establishment is eugenicist-based.
[00:05:54.368 --> 00:05:54.848]  They're evil.
[00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.230]  By any culture's yardstick.
[00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.932]  So you can't trust any of the tech because the big tech companies are so wildly corrupt.
[00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:02.792]  Yeah.
[00:06:03.013 --> 00:06:07.355]  That's why we should go open source, try to support small companies.
[00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:17.659]  But small companies don't make a Canon camera with a color chip that big that gives people total high def look of a $200,000 movie camera just 10 years ago.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.140]  Right.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.361]  So I can't support a mom and pop here.
[00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:27.907]  I mean, now these cannons come out with GPS to mark where you're at, and in the future, the Sony ones, they're saying, you won't have a choice.
[00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:31.891]  It's going to put on the tape or the chip everywhere we've been.
[00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:32.612]  Why?
[00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.734]  Even if we want it turned off.
[00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:35.755]  Jacobson, what do you say to that?
[00:06:42.657 --> 00:06:42.937]  That's it.
[00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:47.243]  They are mapping the entire world, and then they can track it with real-time NSA.
[00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:47.684]  Exactly.
[00:06:47.944 --> 00:06:48.445]  Next question.
[00:06:48.765 --> 00:06:49.726]  I'll pen you down later.
[00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:52.690]  Rob, if you want, you can go wide shot, too, and go check that work you got.
[00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.012]  We're multitasking.
[00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:54.352]  Go ahead.
[00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:05.367]  This is coming from Frito-Mite and he says that he's an EMS and a firefighter and they've been bombarded with disaster drills and mass casualty incident training more and more.
[00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.669]  And he goes, I know they're prepping us for something.
[00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:17.176]  All the major and even smaller EMS and fire services are becoming more and more federalized with new regulations as well as becoming a legal minefield for emergency workers.
[00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:21.700]  They're requiring new vaccines to be taken by health care and emergency workers.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.660]  So what do you say to that?
[00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:29.208]  They use all these disaster drills just to prime federal control.
[00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:34.795]  And then the next phase is, by the way, people who don't like the government are terrorists.
[00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:37.077]  That's the real phase of all of this.
[00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:40.160]  And they're telling the police there will be martial law in October.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.481]  I've confirmed that from all over the country.
[00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:42.942]  I'm not saying that.
[00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:45.625]  They do it to create a fear and go, okay, now take the shot.
[00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:53.171]  They tried to get police, firefighters, and other responders, 14 million of them, first responders, nurses, you name it, under the emergency
[00:07:55.253 --> 00:07:56.234]  What's the exact name?
[00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:57.675]  It's funny with memory here.
[00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:02.318]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act is what always pops in my head, but that's only three years old.
[00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:04.420]  They tried to do that with the
[00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:10.565]  Man, it's so hard to sit there and come up with the exact name.
[00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.687]  It was in 2002, they ordered them to do it.
[00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.549]  Only a few thousand did it.
[00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:18.670]  95 plus percent said no.
[00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:26.055]  The LA Times reported it was 14 million first responders and that almost all of them said no.
[00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:32.639]  And it was the Health States Emergency Powers Act.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.041]  That's almost the name.
[00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.783]  The point is, is that people look all this up for yourself.
[00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:41.289]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:43.251]  Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:44.253]  It's one of those deals.
[00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:46.376]  I'm just going to look it up right now.
[00:08:46.416 --> 00:08:47.557]  It's driving me absolutely insane.
[00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:48.819]  This will end up being 10 hours long.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.523]  Well, I tell you, this is going to be one crazy episode here.
[00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.829]  The state's Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.863]  The model states Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:01.325]  You just looked that up for me, didn't you?
[00:09:01.686 --> 00:09:02.207]  Beautiful.
[00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:06.172]  Maybe we can get you involved, Chris, with the terminal typing right here like we do live on the air.
[00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:06.873]  It would be beautiful.
[00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:12.021]  So you guys are asking me questions and then I'm getting to the point where I can't even... What was the question to begin with?
[00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:17.719]  Essentially, he's an EMS and a firefighter, and they're requiring them to take... Yeah, they use all this fear-mongering.
[00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:20.741]  First, they said, it's the law, you must take anthrax and smallpox shots.
[00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:25.125]  And some cops took it and dropped dead, and the people were like, you know what, I'm not going to take that.
[00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:27.647]  They tried to make the military take it, they refused, there were mutinies.
[00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:32.251]  And then they had that particular move in 2002, but it failed.
[00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:34.352]  So now they're just back doing it again.
[00:09:34.893 --> 00:09:38.135]  Just because they say there's going to be martial law in October doesn't mean there's going to be.
[00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.818]  But I'll tell you this, I've never seen them hyping it so much.
[00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.900]  Christie, what do you think's going on?
[00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:46.201]  I genuinely don't know.
[00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:48.303]  I mean, I'm not in a position to really speak.
[00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:50.124]  Right now, I'm just taking in everything I learned.
[00:09:50.304 --> 00:09:51.385]  I'm just taking it all in.
[00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:53.606]  I do have a question, kind of an extension of that.
[00:09:54.667 --> 00:10:00.411]  Martial law being hyped in October, I mean, I've heard a lot about it, but I've, you know, this tank's on the street in St.
[00:10:00.431 --> 00:10:03.113]  Louis, but where have you heard all of this from?
[00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.674]  I heard it from our
[00:10:06.087 --> 00:10:18.184]  London Media Mole, who turned out to be a famous TV host and filmmaker before he went public, he infiltrated the Olympics as security, said they're saying after the Olympics, it's going to be something that changes the world forever.
[00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:20.868]  They heard stuff like October.
[00:10:22.253 --> 00:10:23.775]  I've just got a lot of other sources.
[00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:25.437]  We've had countless police call in.
[00:10:25.978 --> 00:10:34.529]  I talked to a police officer in Central Texas, I'll just leave it at that, in uniform, who told me they're being told get ready for October.
[00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.791]  Late November, October.
[00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:39.393]  Again, that doesn't mean anything's going to happen.
[00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:41.955]  They've got to have a lot of these programs ready.
[00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:45.538]  The military's being told they've got to be ready for something big by October.
[00:10:46.218 --> 00:10:48.940]  October, November is the election.
[00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:57.686]  October, surprise, if Obama and his controllers decide to try to pull something, then that's the zone for an October surprise.
[00:10:57.706 --> 00:10:58.387]  That makes sense.
[00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:04.790]  But it doesn't mean, when the New York Times comes out and says, Jones said there'd be martial law in October!
[00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.130]  Yeah.
[00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.031]  Talking about it may stop it, or they may have never been planning it to begin with.
[00:11:09.452 --> 00:11:14.934]  The point is, the more and more they admit they're getting ready for civil emergency troops on the street, that's not debated.
[00:11:14.954 --> 00:11:16.995]  I mean, they're going to call it martial law.
[00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:17.635]  What's the next question?
[00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:29.611]  The next question is actually from Soft DMC and they say, I live in a tiny 300 square mile island in Singapore and that's completely built up.
[00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:33.915]  I have nowhere to retreat to where if stuff hits the fan.
[00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:37.018]  I can't expect neighboring countries to take 5 million people.
[00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:39.320]  So is there any advice you have?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.661]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:54.363]  I have never been to Singapore, but I know that it is a globalist model where they arrest you if you drop chewing gum on the ground, or they cane you if you drop stuff on the street.
[00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:56.184]  And some can argue that's law and order.
[00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:57.945]  But it's more than that.
[00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:02.808]  They arrest and go after media that criticize the government.
[00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:05.199]  Crazy bathroom laws, I mean.
[00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:06.821]  Oh yeah, they have cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:11.905]  And they sue for slander and libel.
[00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:13.746]  They have the worst laws on the world.
[00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:16.108]  Anybody that criticizes them, even internationally.
[00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:22.012]  So, I'm not getting anywhere near Singapore, but the word is it's a place for elites.
[00:12:22.773 --> 00:12:25.075]  And then they bring you there, it's very clean, very nice.
[00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:28.618]  But they are coming after you if you've got
[00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.371]  We're good to go.
[00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:54.817]  I mean, that's how advanced Singapore is, is like a test zone.
[00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:56.758]  And it took on kind of the British model.
[00:12:58.138 --> 00:13:07.022]  The guy that started it all was from China and claimed he was anti-authoritarian, but it's really just created a... China, the communist Chinese are looking at Singapore for their new model of oppression.
[00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:10.225]  It's like a hyper type of depression.
[00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:13.906]  And I think they call the guy that founded the country the grand architect or something.
[00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:15.987]  I mean, it's, it's super creepy.
[00:13:16.427 --> 00:13:36.574]  So, uh, I mean, look, I'm not going to say don't live in Singapore because I don't think, I mean, even though I've studied it quite a bit, I don't think I am that jazzed up, to the point, if I'm saying the right word, to be able to sit there and tell somebody that Singapore is a bad place.
[00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:40.947]  So they're just going to have to stick on the island.
[00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:41.768]  Yeah, next question.
[00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:45.069]  My wife sent me a text of a news article and I'm addicted to seeing what it is.
[00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:45.790]  Oh, that's cool.
[00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.330]  I don't understand.
[00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.011]  I'll ask the question you read about that.
[00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.853]  Oh, they're having a vote about should they ban our guns after the shooting in Colorado.
[00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:52.933]  Ugh.
[00:13:53.514 --> 00:13:53.994]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:55.074]  Next question.
[00:13:55.615 --> 00:13:59.457]  The next question comes to you and it's, uh, Vinethicus.
[00:13:59.877 --> 00:14:01.498]  Sorry, I can't pronounce your display name right.
[00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:05.960]  This is all for PlanetInfoWars.com, the Ask Alex area.
[00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:07.927]  I assure you I can read.
[00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:16.871]  Hey Alex, have you thought about printing a geopolitical dictionary of terms with a brief description and example, pictures perhaps, of the term concerned?
[00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:20.753]  For example, false flag, counterintelligence program, etc.
[00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:24.495]  This way you could raise, you could put it in your store essentially.
[00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:26.656]  But I think that's actually kind of a good idea.
[00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:28.117]  Yeah, we've thought about...
[00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.780]  Dictionaries, encyclopedias, like a real history of the world.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.140]  Right.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.384]  I've been offered countless book deals and I just... Not enough time?
[00:14:38.484 --> 00:14:43.908]  I did one and then the ghostwriters, two different ones, would not really put down on paper what I'd said.
[00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:44.568]  It was bizarre.
[00:14:45.148 --> 00:14:46.569]  So I just said I'm not publishing this book.
[00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:46.910]  Yeah.
[00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.551]  They weren't bad people.
[00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:56.774]  But it just didn't turn out to be what I'd said.
[00:14:57.634 --> 00:15:02.839]  I've had some of the biggest publishers in the country come and offer me deals and I just don't trust them.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.521]  They'll manipulate your words?
[00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:07.943]  They basically, yeah.
[00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:10.746]  But yes, that's a great idea.
[00:15:11.528 --> 00:15:23.415]  I definitely need to do video tutorials where we cover maybe, you know, Part 1, defining the New World Order, Part 2, defining the New World Order, Part 3, and then really break down from our research how the real world works.
[00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:24.176]  It's a great idea.
[00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:25.396]  That's a great idea, absolutely.
[00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:27.598]  And tweet them out!
[00:15:27.778 --> 00:15:28.959]  Put them on Facebook, perhaps.
[00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:30.840]  You can check it out on Planet Air Force.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:37.524]  The next question is from Arik, and he says, Alex, do you consider TWA Flight 800 to be a false flag event?
[00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:45.351]  I consider it to be an assassination of a bunch of top Egyptian military brass that were on board the aircraft.
[00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:54.078]  Remember, every few years, a big Egyptian aircraft full of military brass flying back from the US or England crashes in the Mediterranean, crashes in the Atlantic.
[00:15:54.799 --> 00:16:02.145]  I mean, they really are, the Global is trying to make sure Egypt stays in line with them, and I guess they invite them over and offer to pay them off.
[00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:07.189]  And if that crop doesn't take the offer, they're all dead.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:18.146]  Without getting into the whole diatribe, TWA-500 was totally shot down by a continuous rod warhead.
[00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:23.269]  Over 800 witnesses saw it, including over 100 that were on Navy ships and in helicopters.
[00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.454]  There was a drill out there that night, and they used it as a pretext to blow the aircraft out of the sky.
[00:16:29.874 --> 00:16:36.719]  Reporters broke in and got samples of the aircraft, and they reconstructed it, and it had the residue of high explosives on it.
[00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.540]  It was blown up, continuous rod warhead.
[00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:44.693]  And General Parton and others, who was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, to have a look at it and tell what it was.
[00:16:45.494 --> 00:16:45.714]  Wow.
[00:16:46.115 --> 00:16:47.837]  And basically it's just a big sabot.
[00:16:47.877 --> 00:16:50.641]  They just, big old metal rod, they just shoot right through an aircraft.
[00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:51.382]  That's the way to get them.
[00:16:51.402 --> 00:16:55.587]  So they're probably really concerned about all of the uprisings in Egypt and all of that then.
[00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:56.448]  Blown up there.
[00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:59.562]  Well yeah, they were trying to get that going.
[00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:06.625]  They don't want any mainline governments who just want to have a country and have terrorism, people go to college and be happy.
[00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:11.427]  They put radical Shiites or Sunnis in everywhere.
[00:17:12.227 --> 00:17:15.769]  They created Saudi Arabia, they created Al-Qaeda, they created all these people.
[00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:18.410]  That's why they're putting Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now.
[00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.850]  Yeah.
[00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.531]  Accentuate the radicals there.
[00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:22.217]  Yeah, the most radical.
[00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:26.723]  I mean, look, if your country's got women going to college and not wearing burqas, you're dead.
[00:17:26.743 --> 00:17:29.127]  I mean, you know, that's the end of it.
[00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:34.535]  But then they think we're so stupid we've got to give up all of our rights because Al Qaeda may be under the table, Christy.
[00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:35.196]  In fact, have you checked?
[00:17:35.256 --> 00:17:36.558]  Actually, I was just doing that.
[00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:38.539]  No, I mean, you need to check right now.
[00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.099]  I'm scared.
[00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:46.424]  But they think we're so dumb, they run Al-Qaeda against Syria, against Libya, against Iran, against the Serbs, against the Russians.
[00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:47.364]  All the while fucking them.
[00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:48.465]  And then brag!
[00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:48.985]  Yeah.
[00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:52.767]  And then, oh, but these Al-Qaeda that all trained at military bases, they didn't really work for us.
[00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:54.769]  Oh, and Amir al-Awlaki, he was at the Pentagon.
[00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:58.571]  Oh, and, oh, and all these other guys were, and Muttallah was got on the plane by the government.
[00:17:58.591 --> 00:17:59.071]  Underwear bomber.
[00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:00.092]  But never mind, Christy.
[00:18:00.352 --> 00:18:00.992]  Everything's fine.
[00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:01.913]  Isn't Al-Qaeda scary?
[00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:04.456]  We just need a Patsy, that's all we're looking for.
[00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:14.883]  Ramblin' Man asks you, what do you think about Steve Quayle and Hawk, who say evil has taken over and basically we have no hope and even gun owners will not even slow them down?
[00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:26.231]  Well, I think Steve's a really interesting guy and so much of what I'd hear him talk about 15 years ago that I just thought was crazy has, a lot of it's turned out to be true.
[00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:32.075]  And I think he's a really well-meaning good guy who has been a man before his time in many cases.
[00:18:32.844 --> 00:18:34.025]  Do you think this is the case then?
[00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:35.906]  I didn't hear him say that.
[00:18:36.946 --> 00:18:41.509]  And I know he knows there's always hope through Christ and people are really waking up.
[00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:43.910]  All this bad's happening but people are also really waking up.
[00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:47.713]  And I think the idea that nothing can stop it and that's the end of it.
[00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:51.355]  I mean I've got children.
[00:18:51.615 --> 00:18:52.956]  I'm never going to have that view.
[00:18:53.016 --> 00:18:54.277]  And people always...
[00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.197]  Get despondent and think everything's over.
[00:18:59.257 --> 00:19:00.358]  It's always darkest for the dawn.
[00:19:00.378 --> 00:19:05.843]  I mean, I'm not saying the person's lying, but I should probably contact Steve and see if he's really saying that.
[00:19:07.724 --> 00:19:08.765]  What do you think about guns?
[00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:09.746]  This is kind of off topic.
[00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:12.388]  What do you think about guns in relation to nuclear bombs?
[00:19:12.428 --> 00:19:15.611]  I mean, if you have a gun, it's not going to stop someone from nuking your country.
[00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:16.252]  Is that their question?
[00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:16.992]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:19:17.053 --> 00:19:19.595]  It's totally my... We're going to have Christy ask Alex.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:24.181]  No, no, but people always say, oh my God, guns, how are you going to fight helicopters?
[00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:27.062]  You don't go out with your gun and fight a helicopter.
[00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:28.242]  You don't go out and look for it.
[00:19:28.722 --> 00:19:30.622]  People are trying to put you in a concentration camp.
[00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:37.524]  All over Germany, and Poland, everywhere the Nazis went, they would show up and tell the Jews, show up here.
[00:19:37.564 --> 00:19:44.406]  They'd show up orderly with their hats and their stuff, and here's my money, here's my kids, okay, we're going to break you up, put you in a truck, take you away.
[00:19:45.447 --> 00:19:46.208]  I'm not going to do that.
[00:19:46.889 --> 00:19:51.813]  One place in the Warsaw Ghetto, like a couple thousand people, a couple thousand Jews resisted.
[00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.475]  They killed thousands of Nazis.
[00:19:53.715 --> 00:19:55.316]  Something like seven to one they killed.
[00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.500]  They held out for almost three or four months.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.284]  They had to send in divisions in there just because they had some guns and fought back.
[00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:07.928]  I mean, the Germans had big tanks and had Stukas bombing the buildings.
[00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:10.251]  They just stayed in the basements, waited, and killed people.
[00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:11.492]  When they came to get him.
[00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:12.733]  So it's tactics at that point.
[00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.615]  Point is, they just said, well, they're going to kill us anyways.
[00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:18.039]  Might as well just kill some... I mean, you know, I mean it gets down to that point of...
[00:20:19.994 --> 00:20:23.656]  They can't even get our guns and ban them because they know people aren't going to turn them in.
[00:20:23.676 --> 00:20:25.097]  A certain percentage are going to fight.
[00:20:25.718 --> 00:20:26.638]  That's where they hold back.
[00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:28.139]  The founders put that in place.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.360]  The vampires are all around us.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.262]  If you can see them politically, they're all right there.
[00:20:31.282 --> 00:20:31.822]  They're invisible.
[00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:33.603]  You throw dust up, you can suddenly see them.
[00:20:33.823 --> 00:20:39.367]  They're all right there, but the guns, the free speech, the fact that we're fighting, that we're not losing hope, that's holding them back.
[00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:46.412]  The fact that they commit an atrocity, like I believe this was a false flag and all the signs, it's over the top.
[00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:57.093]  The fact that they did all of that, and still are having to automatically still back off, and have to go to the UN and try to ban our guns, I mean, we're not giving up.
[00:20:57.213 --> 00:21:00.057]  And I'm not somebody who shoots my mouth off about violence, but here's the deal.
[00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:07.071]  Me nor my wife or my children, if army trucks come around and say you're going to the FEMA camp or we've got shots for you, we're not doing it.
[00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:07.431]  Right.
[00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:12.833]  And you know, that's the point of, well, it's been nice, uh, you know, being here, but I ain't going alone.
[00:21:12.853 --> 00:21:13.233]  Okay.
[00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.614]  Nobody's taking my kids, none of it.
[00:21:15.094 --> 00:21:16.414]  You're going to have to fight for my children.
[00:21:16.694 --> 00:21:19.595]  And nowadays in a nation of cowards, I guess that's a radical statement.
[00:21:19.855 --> 00:21:21.036]  I'm not going to a death camp.
[00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:27.638]  I'm supposed to just get my hat and like run down into the pit to get, have you seen all those film footage of the naked women stripping off?
[00:21:27.658 --> 00:21:29.779]  Cause they were going to recycle their clothes and stuff.
[00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:32.261]  And they got their babies and they go in there and get shot?
[00:21:32.281 --> 00:21:43.890]  Or like you see one group run down in and they shoot them and then another group, like the guy has the hat in his hand and he wants that approval from the guy in the black uniform so he kind of, no thank you sir, uh-uh.
[00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.673]  And if I'm a tough guy or radical because
[00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.510]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.391]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:55.754]  I mean, if I went in my garage, it's happened before, and there's a big old bull raccoon over there, I mean, they can kill full-grown pit bulls.
[00:21:55.894 --> 00:21:56.674]  I mean, they're that tough.
[00:21:56.954 --> 00:22:00.256]  They jump on their head and, you know, bite their eyes out and try to put them in water.
[00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:01.077]  I mean, they're really tough.
[00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:03.738]  But the point is, it's a little bitty raccoon.
[00:22:03.778 --> 00:22:11.602]  If I walk in my garage and there's one and it goes, you know, I'm just going to go back in the house because let me tell you, I mean, I can either go in there and shoot them or I'm not going to try to find them.
[00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:13.062]  The thing probably only weighs 25 pounds.
[00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:16.346]  But it will tear you apart.
[00:22:16.827 --> 00:22:19.348]  I mean, snapping so fast you'll have bites all over you.
[00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:22.450]  And so we need to look like wolverines or raccoons.
[00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:25.132]  We need to stop thinking of ourselves as these wimps.
[00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:34.599]  A bunch of criminals that have taken over the country and bombed Oklahoma City and staged Fast and Furious think they're going to have some Soviet New World Order takeover, re-education camp operation.
[00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:37.100]  Then, we're not starting a fight, we're here.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.761]  You come and start a fight with me, you're gonna get one right back.
[00:22:39.781 --> 00:22:42.603]  I mean, I'm already point-blank attacking them with words.
[00:22:43.303 --> 00:22:45.885]  And before the shooting starts, that's the most powerful weapon, Kristin.
[00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:50.487]  So, I mean, I'm right up front, like I've done my whole life, just pounding these people right in the face.
[00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:54.229]  Because they're attacking us with their words, with their disinfo, their lies.
[00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:56.310]  My weapon's the truth, it's a lot more powerful.
[00:22:56.738 --> 00:23:01.445]  Wasn't it in the war, the book of... Oh my goodness, I just lost my train of thought.
[00:23:01.845 --> 00:23:03.928]  Essentially, if you have to shoot first, you've already lost.
[00:23:04.369 --> 00:23:06.311]  Isn't that the concept of that?
[00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:07.974]  Sure, until it starts.
[00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.417]  And then once they shoot first, you always shoot first.
[00:23:11.358 --> 00:23:12.180]  You understand the difference?
[00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:15.314]  They start the war.
[00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.174]  They start the war.
[00:23:16.214 --> 00:23:19.935]  That doesn't mean you always shoot second after it starts.
[00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:22.976]  You always shoot first once it starts.
[00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:25.376]  You never shoot first until it starts.
[00:23:25.536 --> 00:23:25.796]  Got it.
[00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:27.476]  Then you choose the time and the place.
[00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:28.056]  There you go.
[00:23:28.337 --> 00:23:28.837]  Under your own.
[00:23:29.597 --> 00:23:29.837]  Got it.
[00:23:31.537 --> 00:23:39.839]  Well, the next one comes to you from Jewel and she says, a few months ago you had Stuart Rhodes on and he mentioned he was going to attend a meeting with state governors.
[00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:40.999]  Have you heard anything back?
[00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:42.219]  No, we should get Stuart Rhodes back on.
[00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:43.244]  Okay.
[00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:43.865]  Done.
[00:23:44.305 --> 00:23:44.965]  Check that one off.
[00:23:46.086 --> 00:23:47.727]  And... And we should get Stewart Rhodes on the next few days.
[00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:48.687]  Yeah.
[00:23:48.968 --> 00:23:49.308]  That'd be good.
[00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:51.169]  The next one is for... How many questions?
[00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:53.330]  Rob, you've got to go edit the other piece of the news tonight.
[00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.151]  How much time do we have?
[00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:57.112]  Do a wide shot.
[00:23:57.152 --> 00:23:58.013]  Run on out and check on that.
[00:23:59.292 --> 00:23:59.612]  Good job.
[00:23:59.652 --> 00:24:00.432]  And leave this all in.
[00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:01.273]  Don't even edit this out.
[00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.233]  We're going to see all the behind the scenes here.
[00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:04.634]  Christy, continue.
[00:24:05.114 --> 00:24:10.096]  The next one comes to you from Nevik, and he says, my question is, how do you feel about the approaching world war?
[00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:13.797]  And how will it affect the freedom movement here in America and globally?
[00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:16.758]  Say that again.
[00:24:16.998 --> 00:24:19.739]  There's a little more to that, but essentially he's he's asking.
[00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:26.690]  He thinks there's an approaching World War III, and how would that affect our freedom movement here?
[00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:27.571]  Oh my gosh.
[00:24:27.631 --> 00:24:27.972]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:27.992 --> 00:24:34.177]  They always get these wars going so that people say, well, it's patriotic, we didn't want to get in the war, but we've got to get behind it now.
[00:24:34.237 --> 00:24:34.617]  Yeah, of course.
[00:24:34.637 --> 00:24:37.400]  And they're creeping towards that with Russia, with China even.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.342]  People say, well, do you like Russia and China?
[00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:40.323]  No, I don't live there.
[00:24:40.843 --> 00:24:47.049]  They're authoritarian too, but I'm run by foreign banks who want to get me into this war so they can get us all in debt to them.
[00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.650]  I don't want to go to the party.
[00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.732]  I don't want to have a war with the cops, with the military, with anybody.
[00:24:52.593 --> 00:24:55.755]  You're just not shooting me up with cancer viruses or taking me to a FEMA camp.
[00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:57.236]  Don't tread on me.
[00:24:57.316 --> 00:25:01.239]  It's like, I'm not looking for trouble, but if you think you're going to walk all over me, it ain't happening.
[00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:04.441]  My fear is that it's happening so slowly, nobody's paying attention.
[00:25:05.282 --> 00:25:09.385]  Well, I mean, they're putting Russian special forces into Syria, and they're battling U.S.
[00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:14.669]  special forces and NATO forces from NATO countries right now in Damascus.
[00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:16.326]  As we speak.
[00:25:16.606 --> 00:25:17.448]  Yeah, there were U.S.
[00:25:17.468 --> 00:25:24.157]  troops killed and mercenaries when they attacked the Russian-held enclave of South Ossetia and Abkhazia back in 2008.
[00:25:24.198 --> 00:25:26.040]  I want you to say that a little faster.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.982]  That was good.
[00:25:28.003 --> 00:25:28.244]  Why?
[00:25:28.264 --> 00:25:30.747]  Because it just sounds very hard to pronounce quickly.
[00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:33.442]  Sorry, not a funny topic.
[00:25:34.002 --> 00:25:38.264]  C4StayAway and Kathy, both users, kind of asked a similar question.
[00:25:38.284 --> 00:25:46.308]  They said, can you give some advice on how to most effectively introduce someone who's never given a thought to a world so turned upside down?
[00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:47.529]  Basically, where do you start?
[00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:49.450]  You know, people, you try to tell them something.
[00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.091]  What's a good way to kind of wake them up?
[00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:56.519]  I shot a piece for the Nightly News that Aaron's about to do live in there when we get up close to 7 here.
[00:25:56.539 --> 00:26:00.045]  That's why Jacobson's in there with my piece for the news, getting it ready right now.
[00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:01.347]  Right, I saw you doing it earlier.
[00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:08.343]  And I just went over the fact that, hey, the radiation was five to eight times higher than they said.
[00:26:08.363 --> 00:26:09.384]  They ordered him to lie about it.
[00:26:10.004 --> 00:26:16.586]  We told you, you know, a year and three, four months ago in Fukushima happened because there were scientists that went in with their own meters and said it.
[00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:18.587]  I mean, people were dying for the radiation.
[00:26:18.607 --> 00:26:19.087]  It was so high.
[00:26:19.227 --> 00:26:19.387]  Yeah.
[00:26:19.407 --> 00:26:20.888]  I mean, we know the type of reactors.
[00:26:20.908 --> 00:26:21.608]  We know their load.
[00:26:21.628 --> 00:26:24.809]  We know some completely melted down bigger than Chernobyl.
[00:26:24.969 --> 00:26:25.469]  They lied.
[00:26:25.869 --> 00:26:26.069]  Yeah.
[00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:27.270]  And that stuff's blowing right at us.
[00:26:28.231 --> 00:26:30.692]  Now they admit the fish, everything.
[00:26:31.273 --> 00:26:33.754]  It's really hit Alaska hard and it's causing a nightmare there.
[00:26:33.774 --> 00:26:39.557]  It turns out that Joe Paterno, of course he knew it at Penn State about that.
[00:26:39.577 --> 00:26:42.199]  I don't see how you couldn't.
[00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:44.320]  The point is... People lie.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.021]  Let me tell you, it's not just about knowing.
[00:26:46.181 --> 00:26:46.381]  Yeah.
[00:26:47.025 --> 00:26:54.549]  People are naive about how evil, evil people crave power and crave getting into positions so they can get away with it all.
[00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:55.449]  That's what it's about.
[00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:04.494]  I mean, a normal person, you know, just wants to have a good, stable life and take care of their family and doesn't shield their wife or their husband because they're trying to be good people.
[00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:09.496]  A normal person doesn't cheat somebody in business because they want them to do good.
[00:27:09.676 --> 00:27:15.498]  And they've got pride in themselves that they do a good business and they work hard and they deserve the money they made.
[00:27:15.878 --> 00:27:18.219]  But more and more people think, no, no, you get ahead.
[00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:23.320]  That's stupid, you know, to not cheat on your family.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.682]  That's stupid to not... But then it goes beyond that.
[00:27:26.962 --> 00:27:31.403]  These evil people like doing things that normal people don't even ever think about.
[00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:32.804]  And so good people
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.881]  Are like blind to evil.
[00:27:36.161 --> 00:27:40.643]  We just can't believe something's actually happening.
[00:27:41.123 --> 00:27:44.485]  You don't want to believe that, because if it does, it crumbles your whole reality.
[00:27:44.645 --> 00:27:46.866]  Yeah, but our whole reality is going to crumble.
[00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:52.208]  See, there's always good running parallel to evil, and evil's supposed to be a little bitty piece of things, you know, in a healthy society.
[00:27:52.388 --> 00:27:54.209]  You want to try to get rid of all of it, but it's always going to be there.
[00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:58.951]  And then good's this big wide band, you know, this stream, and next to it's this evil river.
[00:27:59.622 --> 00:28:06.149]  Well, they told us there is no good and evil, joined that evil into the mainstream, and then infected it all where the whole stream's going dark.
[00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:11.035]  And now they're saying, people that like freedom and don't trust big government, they're the bad ones.
[00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:13.057]  People that like the family, they're the bad ones.
[00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:16.120]  People that want to be honorable, ah, they're just stupid schmucks.
[00:28:16.401 --> 00:28:17.342]  They don't know how to get ahead.
[00:28:17.922 --> 00:28:19.764]  And so they sell all these people that
[00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:21.906]  You know, being corrupt is a way to get ahead.
[00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:25.247]  So they get more and more corrupt, thinking, I would have got ahead if I'd have been more corrupt.
[00:28:25.527 --> 00:28:28.528]  And pretty soon the business dries up, the society collapses.
[00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:29.388]  The globalists know this.
[00:28:29.688 --> 00:28:32.709]  They're imploding society so they can be in control of it.
[00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:37.670]  The way to do good in business is being honest to people, you know, having a name they can trust you.
[00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:44.492]  The way to do good in life is to, you know, not live in the fast lane and be focused.
[00:28:44.532 --> 00:28:49.054]  But they sell people on, oh no, you're missing out because you're not doing this.
[00:28:49.753 --> 00:28:52.774]  You're missing out because, you know, you're not involved in all this.
[00:28:53.795 --> 00:28:56.636]  And this is what you call a fallen society.
[00:28:56.916 --> 00:28:59.377]  They gave us the disease of corruption and evil.
[00:28:59.397 --> 00:29:00.438]  Not that any of us are perfect.
[00:29:01.818 --> 00:29:04.159]  To where we don't even recognize what's good or bad anymore.
[00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:05.720]  So we could be brought down.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.081]  So we could be spiritually blinded.
[00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:10.522]  And the atheists out there are fed up by saying spiritual.
[00:29:10.802 --> 00:29:11.142]  Whatever!
[00:29:11.602 --> 00:29:12.863]  Basic discernment.
[00:29:15.233 --> 00:29:15.873]  Basic discernment.
[00:29:15.893 --> 00:29:16.314]  Because you know what?
[00:29:16.374 --> 00:29:21.137]  I don't see the atheists out there confronting the eugenics and the globalists and the New World Order.
[00:29:21.637 --> 00:29:23.998]  I see you guys attacking us that stand up against it.
[00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:26.060]  And that's not fair to put you all in one basket.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.283]  I also see most of the mainline churches Bible-thumping and a bunch of Pharisees up on the mountain saying they're better than everybody.
[00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.345]  All I know is the world's in a crisis.
[00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:36.766]  Great change is taking place.
[00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:40.548]  And you better be on the side of good, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:43.110]  Because going along with evil does not get you ahead.
[00:29:43.723 --> 00:29:45.144]  Alright, you asked how many questions we've got.
[00:29:45.644 --> 00:29:46.164]  Fifteen?
[00:29:46.204 --> 00:29:47.305]  Can we make them fast, do you think?
[00:29:47.345 --> 00:29:47.865]  Yeah, let's do it.
[00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:49.286]  Okay, this is from Robert.
[00:29:49.306 --> 00:29:51.106]  It's kind of an extension of the last question.
[00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:52.587]  It says, what woke you up?
[00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:54.368]  Is there a specific event?
[00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:59.850]  No, it was a collection of things and just common sense.
[00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:02.552]  And then seeing police deal the drugs where I lived in Dallas.
[00:30:02.612 --> 00:30:09.555]  And then get on the news talking about how they were fighting drugs and use it to shake down people that were buying drugs that they didn't buy from them.
[00:30:11.431 --> 00:30:12.652]  Supply and demand, I suppose.
[00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:20.298]  The next one's from George, and he says, Alex, I would really like to stop participating in the population reduction agent known as cigarettes.
[00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:24.662]  We touched on this, I think, the last portion, too, but here's what worked for you personally.
[00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:26.103]  Just kind of a self-encouragement.
[00:30:29.685 --> 00:30:31.508]  I just got tired of feeling like crap.
[00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:35.573]  And I've quit smoking for four years, two years, one year.
[00:30:35.593 --> 00:30:37.495]  I mean, I kind of always gone off and on.
[00:30:37.515 --> 00:30:43.864]  It always just starts with that cigarette at a bar, out having dinner with friends, and then, oh, you're, you know, buy a pack going home.
[00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:46.507]  And now it's been over a year since I've had one, and I just...
[00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:51.831]  I just no more chewing tobacco, no more cigars, no more any of it.
[00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:57.534]  And I finally had that thing happen that happened a few other times where I quit for four years once or two years on the time.
[00:30:58.615 --> 00:30:59.476]  It stinks to me.
[00:30:59.996 --> 00:31:00.196]  Yeah.
[00:31:00.536 --> 00:31:06.240]  So something happened where it just clicked and I realized this isn't just tobacco.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.201]  They're putting all these additives and stuff in.
[00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:09.602]  So just decide.
[00:31:09.642 --> 00:31:12.543]  It's not like you're fighting to not want to do it.
[00:31:12.763 --> 00:31:14.685]  Just decide that you don't want to.
[00:31:15.782 --> 00:31:18.664]  You know, die 20 years early, and you want to be there for your children.
[00:31:18.904 --> 00:31:19.104]  Yeah.
[00:31:19.665 --> 00:31:26.130]  Well, I actually took it up a little bit in college, and my way of getting over it was that every time I wanted a cigarette, I would go for a run.
[00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.972]  So I just got tired of running, so I didn't want a cigarette.
[00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:29.672]  Well, that's what they say.
[00:31:29.692 --> 00:31:31.814]  They say you've got to replace bad habits with good.
[00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:32.615]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:34.076]  Make it like a conscious effort there.
[00:31:34.736 --> 00:31:49.333]  The next one is from I See the Future, and it says, Alex, have you noticed that right after the Supreme Court hands all this free money to Big Pharma, that all of a sudden Big Pharma will begin to settle out of court on many drugs and illegal practices that they've charged with your tax money, of course?
[00:31:49.353 --> 00:31:50.014]  That's a good question.
[00:31:50.034 --> 00:31:50.695]  When was the first part?
[00:31:51.816 --> 00:32:04.305]  The Supreme Court hands all the free money to Big Pharma and then all of a sudden Big Pharma turns around and... Yeah, the Supreme Court took what Big Pharma wrote and they bragged they did the health care plan, which is trillions of dollars over the next decade.
[00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:10.129]  And then yes, now they're settling because it's just coming out, all their whistleblowers are coming out.
[00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.714]  So that's really what's going on, is that the whistleblowers, it's so immoral what's happening.
[00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:20.079]  They're all coming out and speaking out.
[00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:21.440]  It's like in Europe and the U.S.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.643]  it turned out for 20 years they've been setting and rigging the interest rates.
[00:32:24.663 --> 00:32:25.263]  Well, no kidding.
[00:32:26.304 --> 00:32:27.124]  To rip people off.
[00:32:27.525 --> 00:32:29.766]  They've made trillions conservatively.
[00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:30.487]  That's admitted.
[00:32:30.727 --> 00:32:32.428]  They're paying a $22 billion fine.
[00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:43.196]  So, it's kind of like when they caught Wells Fargo and Wachovia laundering $300 plus trillion, excuse me, $300 plus billion in drug money a few years ago.
[00:32:43.216 --> 00:32:43.917]  It was in the news.
[00:32:45.118 --> 00:32:45.938]  They paid a $115 million fine.
[00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.765]  Well, if it was $376 billion, what is $100 million?
[00:32:50.785 --> 00:32:54.668]  I think it came out to a very low percent.
[00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:55.209]  I think it was 10%.
[00:32:55.529 --> 00:32:56.390]  I've got to do the math again.
[00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.672]  I think it was like 3% or something.
[00:32:58.692 --> 00:32:59.353]  I'm going from memory.
[00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:00.654]  $300 billion roughly?
[00:33:00.674 --> 00:33:01.294]  $3 billion is 1%.
[00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:02.976]  So what would you say it was?
[00:33:12.518 --> 00:33:13.038]  Oh man.
[00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:14.640]  It was, it was, it was $376 billion.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:14.740]  Okay.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.161]  People just type in banks laundered $376 billion, Bloomberg, APL come up.
[00:33:17.182 --> 00:33:19.223]  $376 billion and they paid, I think it was $110 or $115 million.
[00:33:19.243 --> 00:33:20.204]  Just say $110 million, fine.
[00:33:20.224 --> 00:33:20.324]  Wow.
[00:33:20.344 --> 00:33:20.684]  So what's that?
[00:33:20.704 --> 00:33:21.645]  $110 million divided into $376 billion.
[00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.950]  Jesus.
[00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.651]  I don't even know.
[00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:41.432]  I can't even... I need a calculator.
[00:33:41.812 --> 00:33:44.894]  The point is... It's a minuscule amount.
[00:33:44.914 --> 00:33:45.635]  We've done it before.
[00:33:45.655 --> 00:33:45.735]  Yeah.
[00:33:46.555 --> 00:33:47.036]  Minuscule.
[00:33:47.496 --> 00:33:49.217]  So the issue here is...
[00:33:52.517 --> 00:33:54.098]  They've got a license to kill and steal.
[00:33:54.558 --> 00:33:59.701]  And so even if some of the crooks aren't totally evil, they're going to give way to even worse and worse people.
[00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:04.364]  That's how once corruption starts, it's a wedge and they blow it open for everybody.
[00:34:04.524 --> 00:34:04.724]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:08.586]  And then now the very worst of the worse are in there, like Stalin.
[00:34:08.606 --> 00:34:12.088]  They get more and more power and no one can resist them anymore.
[00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:17.351]  And so whatever their darkest nightmare is and all their servants dreams are, that is turned loose.
[00:34:19.506 --> 00:34:20.386]  Does that sound fun?
[00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:21.867]  No, absolutely not.
[00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:22.847]  It sounds horrific.
[00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:29.929]  The next one's from Hykesalot, and he says, Alex, will illegal aliens be exempt from paying for the new health care tax?
[00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:34.550]  Yes, they've already announced they're exempt and they're going to have it all free until the country is fully bankrupt.
[00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.452]  The job is bankrupt the country because they're loaning us all fiat money to begin with.
[00:34:38.512 --> 00:34:39.492]  They want real assets.
[00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:46.161]  So then bankrupt the country and I mean Greece is already going through a bailout, Spain's going through a potential bailout.
[00:34:46.201 --> 00:34:48.181]  Three or four bailouts, they always get more.
[00:34:48.581 --> 00:34:53.903]  Then what's, then if everybody's broke then there's just this very very very elite and that's it.
[00:34:54.303 --> 00:35:00.285]  Who have written the laws where they're tax exempt with hundreds of trillions of dollars offshore.
[00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:00.745]  Right.
[00:35:01.465 --> 00:35:03.225]  And so then they can come back and buy it all up.
[00:35:05.302 --> 00:35:11.384]  So essentially they just want everybody to collapse and then they get to just have the, like America becomes their own personal island.
[00:35:11.404 --> 00:35:14.845]  Yeah, just type in Boss Hog on banking in YouTube and he'll explain it.
[00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:15.725]  Boss Hog.
[00:35:15.745 --> 00:35:16.586]  I want to watch that.
[00:35:17.006 --> 00:35:17.926]  Boss Hog on banking.
[00:35:17.946 --> 00:35:19.126]  He's explaining it to Roscoe.
[00:35:19.907 --> 00:35:26.789]  And Roscoe's like, Boss, why do you want to loan them money when they ain't got it to pay it back for the carnival?
[00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:29.570]  He goes, that's easy, Roscoe.
[00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.431]  What you do is you don't loan money to people when they don't have money.
[00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.527]  He says, that's what you think.
[00:35:37.567 --> 00:35:44.810]  No, you loan people money when they don't have it because then you got the promissory note side and you get all their property.
[00:35:45.411 --> 00:35:47.692]  Then Roscoe's like, oh, that sounds good, boss.
[00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:50.373]  I'm not doing a very good imitation here because I'm tired.
[00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.175]  We'll just skip around all our movies here.
[00:35:55.535 --> 00:35:56.836]  That wasn't the best imitation.
[00:35:58.036 --> 00:35:58.497]  It was good.
[00:35:58.537 --> 00:36:01.078]  I think they were going to close up on that one too.
[00:36:02.215 --> 00:36:08.129]  Uh, Imagine asks you, what did you mean when you said, I should create another movie about 9-11?
[00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.337]  Is there something that would blow it even more open?
[00:36:12.892 --> 00:36:23.300]  Well, I've made four films concerning the inside job that was 9-11, this catastrophic, catalyzing event meant to launch us into this new dark age of tyranny.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.182]  And PNAC's own words, Dick Cheney and others own words.
[00:36:28.163 --> 00:36:33.927]  A year before 9-11, they wrote about how they wanted a Pearl Harbor event to do all this false flag, just pure evil.
[00:36:34.468 --> 00:36:38.531]  They also talk about race-specific bioweapons they want to use to kill certain races of people.
[00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:40.816]  That barely got any news coverage.
[00:36:40.837 --> 00:36:43.579]  Our local Austin paper thought it was horrific, wrote an article about it.
[00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:45.261]  People who want to look that up, you think I'm joking.
[00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.123]  But the peanut document's public.
[00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:53.669]  The reason I would make a new 9-11 film now would be, I would start it with just all the admitted governments.
[00:36:54.009 --> 00:36:59.555]  The Nazis, the czars, the communist Russians, Israel, the United States, England.
[00:37:00.436 --> 00:37:01.356]  They do it constantly.
[00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:12.107]  So from the USS Liberty, to Operation Ajax in Iran, to the Gulf of Tonkin, to Operation Northwoods, right through, and then events that happened after 9-11.
[00:37:12.127 --> 00:37:14.688]  I would just look at all the other events in the first half of the film.
[00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:22.832]  And then I would look at how 9-11 changed our world, and then I would say, now here's the top 20 points of 9-11.
[00:37:23.372 --> 00:37:24.273]  Like I would do 9-11 at the end.
[00:37:25.799 --> 00:37:30.721]  Because people are like, well, why would you just say it's an inside job, even though there's the motive, the police hit the takeover?
[00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:35.102]  But the fact is, it's just hard-hitting with all these historians and proof and documents.
[00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:38.483]  Okay, here's 20 false flags our government and other governments did.
[00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:47.186]  And here's how our world changed and how they used it, and how they're now saying it isn't Al-Qaeda, it's people that don't like big government or the terrorists and returning veterans.
[00:37:47.826 --> 00:37:52.248]  And then, oh, they're funding Al-Qaeda in Syria and Libya and, you know, show that history.
[00:37:53.266 --> 00:37:58.467]  And show how our world has changed, and then go, do you now want me to show you why 9-11 is an inside job?
[00:37:58.787 --> 00:37:59.927]  Okay, I will.
[00:38:00.488 --> 00:38:05.329]  Not just who's got a motive, who's got a history of it, but here's 20 points.
[00:38:05.889 --> 00:38:07.429]  And by the way, sit there with just a list.
[00:38:07.569 --> 00:38:08.029]  That'd be awesome.
[00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:12.270]  Showing, maybe have an extra that's like two hours with another hundred points.
[00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.170]  Yeah.
[00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:20.012]  Because I mean, that's the problem with 9-11, is that it is ridiculous how out in the open this is.
[00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:21.412]  That's what's frustrating.
[00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.012]  That'd be fun, I can't wait.
[00:38:24.312 --> 00:38:24.692]  Extras.
[00:38:25.733 --> 00:38:41.487]  This next one actually was the Oneanaut, and it says, Hello Alex, there's a YouTuber that shows the visual proof that the paintings from Michelangelo and others in the 1600s did not simply paint images of God, but rather the nebulous structures that exist within the Orion Nebula.
[00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:49.534]  He provides so many examples that it's pretty arguable that the ancient people of the world knew, as David Icke says, the true nature of consciousness.
[00:38:50.114 --> 00:38:52.216]  So, what are your thoughts on any of that?
[00:38:53.037 --> 00:38:57.201]  Certainly, ancient cultures know a lot more than they're given credit for.
[00:38:57.681 --> 00:39:01.025]  Certainly, the pyramids weren't built the way we were told.
[00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:07.811]  The Dogon tribe, all these different tribes had knowledge of star systems that were way further out.
[00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:09.233]  I don't know is the answer.
[00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:13.033]  I've got documents admitting they've got plans for forced inoculation.
[00:39:13.073 --> 00:39:14.134]  People say, oh, that's your opinion.
[00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:22.977]  I interviewed all the top admirals who heard the call from LBJ to let the ship sink and the Israeli pilots went public that USS Liberty was staged.
[00:39:23.017 --> 00:39:24.257]  People go, oh, that's just your opinion.
[00:39:24.517 --> 00:39:25.238]  Well, no, it's not.
[00:39:25.778 --> 00:39:27.358]  I've interviewed like 20 people from the ship.
[00:39:27.378 --> 00:39:28.219]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:39:28.819 --> 00:39:31.460]  I've interviewed dozens of people from Oklahoma City.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.060]  They say, oh, that's just your opinion.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.762]  Oh, it's really the cops, the witnesses, of that being an inside job.
[00:39:37.722 --> 00:39:43.520]  So I just don't go there because I could study that all day long and never really get an answer because...
[00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:59.038]  Yeah, I mean, I've seen the cave paintings, I've seen the Aztec stuff that looks like flying saucers, I've seen the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the thought it was made up on the internet when I actually looked up the official photos and stuff, and it's real, and how they've walled off most of that.
[00:39:59.659 --> 00:40:04.262]  The truth is, everything the elite do is about suppressing technologies developed in the last hundred years.
[00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.003]  Not just Nikola Tesla, but others.
[00:40:07.164 --> 00:40:08.365]  We are living in what we think is 2012.
[00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:15.204]  But the establishment is, and that's their power trip.
[00:40:15.224 --> 00:40:24.407]  I mean, how uncool is that for the ruling elite to like put us down here in this TV land BS thing where the average person is watching, you know, Dancing with the Stars and somebody's got talent.
[00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:33.491]  And meanwhile, dumbing us down and giving us cancer and all this while they prance around the national security state that our inventors, our scientists, our money built.
[00:40:33.751 --> 00:40:38.993]  They take our best and recruit them and they go behind that iron curtain of national security and disappear.
[00:40:40.013 --> 00:40:43.116]  And then the worst people are taking control of our development.
[00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:44.718]  It's just, it's horrible.
[00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:45.839]  Right.
[00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:47.080]  And we touched on this too.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.026]  I mean, they earn billions and they pay, if they ever do, pay fines of minuscule amounts in comparison.
[00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:58.611]  Well, by some strange twist of fate, the Eloy will become the slaves and the Morlocks the masters.
[00:40:59.781 --> 00:41:00.962]  I don't like that.
[00:41:01.663 --> 00:41:07.069]  The Freeman1 asks you, when are you going to make the next Brothers in Arms episodes?
[00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:12.494]  And when you make the next one, can you guys shoot up old cars and maybe a black wall to show the power?
[00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:16.623]  We have got the sponsors lined up.
[00:41:16.904 --> 00:41:17.904]  The guys want to do it.
[00:41:18.224 --> 00:41:19.825]  I have just been off more than I can chew.
[00:41:19.925 --> 00:41:21.506]  We've hired six new graphics people.
[00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:24.528]  I'm hiring probably five, six more reporters.
[00:41:24.988 --> 00:41:27.630]  The equipment, the people, the staff, the room.
[00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.531]  Do we buy another building or do we rent the one?
[00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:34.013]  I mean, you know, there's a lot goes into this to get to this level we've gotten to.
[00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:36.455]  And we could do this because of you, the listeners, supporting us.
[00:41:36.635 --> 00:41:37.035]  Absolutely.
[00:41:37.255 --> 00:41:38.816]  And so a lot of that depends on you.
[00:41:40.962 --> 00:41:52.774]  I'm trying to hire some more salespeople so that we can shell to have the money to get the sponsors with the guns and go out and shoot it and the camera people and there's a lot that goes into it and then you know the waiver forms and just all of it.
[00:41:52.794 --> 00:41:55.477]  But yes, I do plan on gun shows in the future.
[00:41:55.918 --> 00:41:57.199]  Steiner Brothers are great guys.
[00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:57.920]  They want to be involved.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.281]  I just had a dinner with them.
[00:42:00.582 --> 00:42:01.163]  Shane Steiner.
[00:42:01.183 --> 00:42:03.104]  It's a cool dinner over at their Steiner Steakhouse.
[00:42:03.525 --> 00:42:04.045]  Friday night.
[00:42:04.546 --> 00:42:09.309]  Mrs. Mustaine, Dave Mustaine, my wife, the kids, and Shane Steiner with them.
[00:42:09.329 --> 00:42:10.591]  We were having our meeting about that.
[00:42:11.071 --> 00:42:13.953]  Dave wants to come out on the show, so you might see a Brothers in Arms down the road.
[00:42:14.334 --> 00:42:17.897]  I did some shooting with Dave this weekend, but we're going to wait to release that for a while.
[00:42:18.977 --> 00:42:22.841]  But a lot of cool stuff coming up, so yes.
[00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:25.123]  We've already shot the next episode of Brothers in Arms.
[00:42:25.745 --> 00:42:29.468]  But we shot it on this right here at my house, and it's awesome.
[00:42:29.668 --> 00:42:30.929]  Okay, all right, keep going here.
[00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:32.430]  That's the exclusive look there.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:37.914]  This next one comes to you from Kimberly from upstate New York, and she says, great interview with Congresswoman Blackburn.
[00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:45.119]  Maybe next time you can speak to her, you can suggest that she and the other Congress officials send out a request to their constituents to rally in front of Congress.
[00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:48.481]  So is there anything that you have to say to that?
[00:42:48.541 --> 00:42:53.805]  Maybe bring her back on and do that, or any sort of idea and mainstream media leverage, if you will.
[00:42:54.045 --> 00:42:57.629]  Well, I mean, these politicians need to get people rallied already.
[00:42:57.649 --> 00:43:00.271]  I mean, if they claim... I mean, where's the Tea Party?
[00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:04.796]  It got co-opted by a bunch of, you know, a bunch of establishment Republicans.
[00:43:06.418 --> 00:43:07.619]  Here, I'm going to show you some of this.
[00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:10.281]  Is this the Brothers in Arms video?
[00:43:10.301 --> 00:43:12.624]  Hold on, we're not going to put this on TV yet.
[00:43:23.959 --> 00:43:25.080]  I can't wait to put this out on air.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.181]  This is the kind of stuff that you should send on your Facebook, Alex.
[00:43:29.662 --> 00:43:30.022]  Well, no.
[00:43:31.022 --> 00:43:32.843]  Is this like the legit version?
[00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:33.543]  No.
[00:43:34.024 --> 00:43:34.864]  Look at what we're shooting.
[00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:38.225]  Hold on.
[00:43:38.325 --> 00:43:39.406]  Folks, you'll get to see this yet.
[00:43:43.668 --> 00:43:44.368]  I think so.
[00:43:45.249 --> 00:43:48.450]  He just shot a big, what would you call it, knight armor?
[00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.511]  You know those knights you see at Mexican food restaurants?
[00:43:52.765 --> 00:43:53.645]  Wait till you see it.
[00:43:54.205 --> 00:43:57.086]  Yeah, we're getting ready for the next Brothers in Arms, to answer your question.
[00:43:57.446 --> 00:43:58.007]  All right.
[00:43:58.487 --> 00:43:59.967]  I'm working like seven days a week here.
[00:44:00.227 --> 00:44:00.527]  Go ahead.
[00:44:00.907 --> 00:44:02.008]  All right.
[00:44:02.268 --> 00:44:08.469]  I think we kind of summed up the Congresswoman Blackburn question, you know, just, yeah, it'd be great, but they kind of need to take care of it themselves.
[00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:16.832]  The next one is from Steven from San Diego, and he says, Tom Woods and James Colbert are recent converts to anarcho-capitalism.
[00:44:17.532 --> 00:44:19.374]  And I've heard you agreeing with them.
[00:44:19.714 --> 00:44:20.975]  So what are your thoughts?
[00:44:21.435 --> 00:44:23.817]  When are you going to embrace anarcho-capitalism?
[00:44:25.318 --> 00:44:27.120]  Like I suddenly agree with them?
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.142]  I mean, I've always been of a libertarian mind.
[00:44:30.443 --> 00:44:33.885]  People can sell all these great pipe dreams about the total state and how great it's going to be.
[00:44:34.486 --> 00:44:44.154]  Government, nine times out of ten, delivers disaster, enslavement, poverty, special interests controlling government, shutting down their competition and getting rich off government welfare.
[00:44:44.804 --> 00:44:47.086]  Corporate welfare.
[00:44:47.146 --> 00:44:54.994]  I've always been on two polar opposites of total state, Borg, hive mind versus total anarchy.
[00:44:56.556 --> 00:45:01.260]  I'm trying to get away from the gravitational political pull of big government towards anarchy.
[00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:08.568]  But anarchy itself in its pure form, past these dreams these dreamers have, like when the Soviets had their dreams.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.361]  That's not a permanent form.
[00:45:10.401 --> 00:45:11.422]  Well, exactly.
[00:45:12.302 --> 00:45:15.585]  Let's say you had a state that voted to be totally out in the open.
[00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:21.570]  You would immediately get criminal gangs that got together that came and tried to take over your area.
[00:45:22.271 --> 00:45:32.039]  And so you had to be like Switzerland, armed and ready to defend and some type of mutual defense structure where people agree upon a code and agree that they're going to defend each other.
[00:45:33.175 --> 00:45:43.381]  Uh, but a system like that creates so much wealth when you are free that your kids become spoiled rotten and make deals with the guy in the next state just because it'll make dad bad.
[00:45:44.022 --> 00:45:49.245]  So you're, you know, the reason you always get a government is because there's another big government trying to come take you over.
[00:45:49.765 --> 00:45:52.027]  So they can't really answer that question properly.
[00:45:52.147 --> 00:45:54.088]  And believe me, I do all the research I've read over it.
[00:45:54.468 --> 00:45:55.389]  So I'm just saying, hey,
[00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:59.153]  I know you guys got all the answers, pie in the sky, this Valhalla of no government.
[00:45:59.453 --> 00:46:03.257]  Can we just get rid of the private Federal Reserve, though, that poses as government?
[00:46:03.297 --> 00:46:12.706]  Because you see, so many of the globalists are actually trying to fund the libertarian movement right now because they've already stolen the money, they've already made themselves offshore and exempt from the governments they control.
[00:46:13.787 --> 00:46:17.171]  Now they want to move to the mode of exempting themselves completely.
[00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:19.211]  Now they've stolen everything.
[00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:28.623]  So if there was a collectivized dam and they got handed it by government and now they're going to charge us for the power from that over what it should be when they bought it from us.
[00:46:28.663 --> 00:46:35.131]  See, it's more sophisticated than just getting up and saying, you know, I'm an anarchic capitalist.
[00:46:37.626 --> 00:46:45.590]  People say, well, you have Ron Paul on promoting gold and silver currencies, but then you have another guy on for state banks, another lady on, you know, promoting a government fiat system.
[00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.770]  Which is it?
[00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:48.691]  Well, it's about you making a decision.
[00:46:48.732 --> 00:46:51.453]  It's about educating people about monetary issues.
[00:46:51.513 --> 00:46:54.655]  It's not about saying this is the one way and this is the absolute way.
[00:46:54.915 --> 00:47:02.659]  All I know is I don't like foreign banks that happen to be eugenicists, who funded Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, in control, and signing us onto their debt.
[00:47:02.959 --> 00:47:04.140]  Let's get rid of that system.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.404]  And if it transitioned, because the problem is they own all the gold too, that's a problem.
[00:47:10.444 --> 00:47:12.445]  So I'd be for a gold system if the elites have most of it.
[00:47:12.926 --> 00:47:22.333]  You know, do we get back to a government system where everyone's educated about it and then there's a fiat system that's controlled and zero interest credit like the bankers got to the people?
[00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:25.235]  Listen, they act like, oh, we're trying to make the economy go quick.
[00:47:25.555 --> 00:47:35.383]  The bankers actually brag they want a post-industrial world and that they're mad there's so much wealth and so much ingenuity, they call it overheating, that everything they do with taxes is to shut down production.
[00:47:35.903 --> 00:47:38.205]  They've given over $40 trillion just in the U.S.
[00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:43.269]  in the last five years to the banksters to bail out the debt they created as they hold us hostage.
[00:47:44.918 --> 00:47:55.441]  If $40 trillion had been loaned by a federal bank or the state banks, I like the idea of it being broken up, to the people, do you have any idea what 0% interest at $40 billion would do?
[00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:57.801]  I can't even imagine it.
[00:47:58.841 --> 00:47:59.962]  It would be amazing.
[00:48:00.162 --> 00:48:02.462]  There would be so many businesses and things starting up.
[00:48:02.562 --> 00:48:05.863]  And people argue, well that would overheat like the real estate thing.
[00:48:05.943 --> 00:48:07.804]  Whatever, at least you get some real economy.
[00:48:08.224 --> 00:48:08.824]  The point is,
[00:48:10.294 --> 00:48:17.036]  This is a complex system we're talking about, and I have spent 20 years studying it, 17 years on air.
[00:48:19.257 --> 00:48:27.659]  And there is no simple answer, other than you need local control, you need states' rights, you need the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:31.801]  Because a lot of libertarians and our capitalists go, man, that's so 1776.
[00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:39.583]  You know, I like this thing the founder of PayPal is pushing, just free islands with all the sex you want, it's going to be totally cool.
[00:48:40.225 --> 00:48:41.086]  No more taxes.
[00:48:41.566 --> 00:48:41.866]  Bull.
[00:48:42.046 --> 00:48:42.286]  Right.
[00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:45.449]  That's the globalists coming along, going, oh, this libertarian thing's hot.
[00:48:45.729 --> 00:48:46.910]  Let's sell them on our version.
[00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:57.157]  So I'm not looking for pie in the sky like, you know, the opposite of anarchic capitalism, the total collectivist computer run who programs the computer nightmare of zeitgeist.
[00:48:57.677 --> 00:48:59.858]  Where we all go live in plastic super domes together.
[00:49:01.139 --> 00:49:03.480]  Give me the total anarchic capitalism over that.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:11.744]  But basically, if you don't have a free, informed, involved, aggressive population, anything you do is going to be game and taken over by corrupt people.
[00:49:12.084 --> 00:49:13.484]  That's the secret of politics.
[00:49:13.504 --> 00:49:14.945]  Do you have human nature to do that?
[00:49:15.365 --> 00:49:15.806]  That's it.
[00:49:15.866 --> 00:49:26.971]  If you're not fiercely independent, agreeing on a basic stoic code of the family and decency and honor and being aggressive, you've got to be willing when somebody gets in your face to get right back in their face.
[00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:29.534]  Or that's the creed of slaves to do otherwise.
[00:49:30.215 --> 00:49:37.425]  So until we stop following the creed of slaves, any system that they try to implement will be backdoored and gamed from minute one.
[00:49:39.629 --> 00:49:41.532]  I think we should do a little excerpt on that later.
[00:49:42.233 --> 00:49:42.974]  That's really interesting.
[00:49:43.826 --> 00:49:45.507]  Let's get Jacobson's take.
[00:49:45.927 --> 00:49:47.429]  Rob, come on over here to the mic.
[00:49:47.449 --> 00:49:48.329]  You can kneel down and talk.
[00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:49.210]  I only have a chair for you.
[00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.571]  Here, jump in here, Jacobson.
[00:49:51.031 --> 00:49:54.754]  Jacobson, give us your take on, you know, communism versus anarchy.
[00:49:54.974 --> 00:49:57.636]  Well, I would mostly agree with what you said.
[00:49:57.696 --> 00:50:04.680]  I think that while anarchy sounds great and at the end of the day... Jacobson never says uh until he's on air.
[00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:05.501]  Just hit it.
[00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:06.822]  Do your normal self, Jacobson.
[00:50:07.042 --> 00:50:17.328]  Basically, if you have an anarchy system, what you're going to have is you're going to have organized crime swooping in immediately, pretending like they're a bunch of kings and burning down everybody's house.
[00:50:17.408 --> 00:50:23.851]  Because if you walk away from your own land, unless you're armed and you're staying there all the time, somebody's going to come and burn it down.
[00:50:24.331 --> 00:50:30.675]  I think that basically what has to happen is, outside of total communism, we have to break it down to local rules.
[00:50:30.735 --> 00:50:32.056]  Sheriffs is the answer.
[00:50:32.156 --> 00:50:32.676]  Exactly.
[00:50:32.936 --> 00:50:33.516]  Exactly.
[00:50:33.596 --> 00:50:35.197]  Let's say... There you go, Jacobson.
[00:50:37.196 --> 00:50:39.276]  We're always hearing about pie in the sky, no rules.
[00:50:39.296 --> 00:50:41.617]  That's because the bankers now have taken over a lot of libertarianism.
[00:50:41.637 --> 00:50:42.577]  They want that for themselves.
[00:50:43.377 --> 00:50:45.858]  We have to say, can we just get back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[00:50:45.878 --> 00:50:48.098]  Can we just get back to due process?
[00:50:48.118 --> 00:50:49.139]  Can we just get back to that?
[00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:53.379]  And then we can debate all day because the media says the Constitution failed.
[00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:53.799]  No, it didn't.
[00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:54.660]  We gave up on it.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.400]  What we have now didn't create this.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.100]  Capitalism didn't create this.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.341]  Free market didn't create this.
[00:50:59.701 --> 00:51:01.221]  Crony insider stuff.
[00:51:01.501 --> 00:51:02.401]  People above the law.
[00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:04.322]  Hell, the bankers are living in anarchy.
[00:51:04.662 --> 00:51:05.702]  They get away with whatever they want.
[00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:08.324]  We're under all this communism down here.
[00:51:08.584 --> 00:51:10.525]  They're up there at the global level of free-for-all.
[00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:27.416]  In fact, you can consider the system we're living in right now just a major anarchy being taken over by the most major criminal group on earth and we're just under their subjection right now because according to their point of view, it's a lawlessness that they live in and we're underneath their thumb and there's no law for us and there's no law for them either.
[00:51:28.297 --> 00:51:28.817]  Exactly.
[00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:31.099]  People aren't even identifying what this is.
[00:51:32.847 --> 00:51:34.429]  I mean, they're not even identifying what this is.
[00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:37.052]  Like, most of the libertarians battle with cops all day.
[00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:41.016]  Cops are people that went to college or whatever, get a degree, and are just out there.
[00:51:41.396 --> 00:51:43.378]  Some of them control freaks, some of them good, some of them bad.
[00:51:43.398 --> 00:51:45.000]  We need to talk about the system.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.602]  And I'm not critiquing libertarian thought.
[00:51:47.082 --> 00:51:51.087]  It's just that there's like this thing of like, I can say the word anarchic capitalism, the term.
[00:51:51.768 --> 00:51:53.369]  Why don't you join that with us?
[00:51:53.389 --> 00:51:54.470]  Why don't you come on up here?
[00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:56.313]  Others have been covering it.
[00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:57.615]  I see you suddenly agree.
[00:51:57.635 --> 00:52:00.920]  Let me tell you about geopolitical systems.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.163]  Alex, have you ever heard of 9-11 truth?
[00:52:05.157 --> 00:52:07.678]  Anyways, I'm like, no, I had never heard of that.
[00:52:09.238 --> 00:52:13.379]  Again, folks, if you want freedom, it's a hard job, but it's a fun job.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.060]  Because being a slave's a lot harder.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.560]  Jacobs, any other points on that?
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:23.502]  No, I just think that what has to happen is it should be local governments, local control, and what happens is- Because those are firewalls.
[00:52:23.542 --> 00:52:25.343]  If you don't like the corruption in town, you move.
[00:52:25.683 --> 00:52:29.124]  Suddenly, everybody votes with their feet, their dollars, they leave Blossog.
[00:52:29.344 --> 00:52:38.369]  Exactly, and if one sheriff happens to be corrupt, he'll be isolated in his own little community by all the law, like you've got other sheriffs surrounding him, and it will be contained.
[00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:41.710]  Whereas as right now, it's like a nation... Hold on, I see the IT guy.
[00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.312]  We've gone so long, the show is about to go live on TV.
[00:52:44.332 --> 00:52:45.092]  I've got to go in there.
[00:52:45.412 --> 00:52:45.852]  Come on in.
[00:52:46.653 --> 00:52:47.253]  Do you need me?
[00:52:49.114 --> 00:52:50.195]  Did they get the show done?
[00:52:50.235 --> 00:52:50.715]  Are they ready?
[00:52:52.432 --> 00:52:53.073]  They're still going.
[00:52:53.113 --> 00:52:57.277]  Well, then the answer is we've got to stop with the questions for PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:52:57.518 --> 00:52:59.180]  We'll addendum the three or four left.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:52:59.980]  What is there, ten left?
[00:53:01.782 --> 00:53:02.623]  There's ten left.
[00:53:02.663 --> 00:53:03.584]  We'll do those.
[00:53:03.604 --> 00:53:05.006]  It takes three times to do 50.
[00:53:05.427 --> 00:53:07.649]  Later, PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.412]  It's 655.
[00:53:10.853 --> 00:53:11.754]  You know what that means.
[00:53:13.115 --> 00:53:13.776]  Showtime.
