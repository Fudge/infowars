[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:07.975]  So... Big Brother.
[00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:09.677]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:11.678]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:12.979]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.701]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.884]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:23.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:29.946]  I'll guarantee you it's an intelligence operation to infiltrate and set up these men.
[00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:36.191]  General who sent thousands of inappropriate emails to women who reported harassment by Petraeus' mistress.
[00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.334]  You got the FBI spying on the CIA director?
[00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:40.815]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:41.616]  That's off the charts.
[00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:47.085]  We're going to be breaking that down with Dr. Steve Pachinick coming up, getting his take on what's really going on.
[00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:48.306]  He personally knows Petraeus.
[00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:51.810]  Goes to the CFR and called out General Dempsey.
[00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.274]  He said there wouldn't be an Iran attack because the Joint Chiefs had told Israel there wouldn't be.
[00:00:57.094 --> 00:01:00.738]  I respect what he has to say, but we're going to try to flesh it all out.
[00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:03.340]  Coming up, this is going to be some pretty powerful radio.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.682]  Gary in New York, you're on the air.
[00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:06.663]  Thanks for holding, sir.
[00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:08.625]  Are you celebrating Obama's victory?
[00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.237]  No, sir.
[00:01:10.377 --> 00:01:10.898]  No, I'm not.
[00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:11.999]  I'm a true patriot.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.383]  First off, God bless you and your staff.
[00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:15.785]  I appreciate all you guys do.
[00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:16.425]  Thank you.
[00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:26.199]  You know, I was thinking, maybe this, before I get on my Obamunoids, pushing Obamunism statement, possibly this
[00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:29.867]  The Petraeus thing could be a blessing in disguise.
[00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.709]  Maybe, you know, start some things up.
[00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:35.970]  Possibly get Obama maybe in some trouble.
[00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.152]  Well, my gut is, this is what they did with Nixon and others.
[00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:44.775]  When somebody goes into a second term, they're dangerous to even the establishment because they're not facing re-election.
[00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:49.998]  And if a president ever tried to actually act like a president, and not just a total puppet, they have to assassinate him.
[00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.920]  But they don't like that either, because people won't buy that anymore, like Kennedy.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.461]  So instead what they do is they destroy it with a scandal.
[00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:03.986]  But they don't like scandals that deal with corporate corruption, so they usually get you with a sex scandal, like Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
[00:02:05.207 --> 00:02:08.329]  And again, I was no fan of Bill Clinton, but that was all part and parcel of that.
[00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:17.236]  The Republicans wouldn't go after him, you know, for the missile secrets of Laura Allen Hughes, the Communist Chinese, or the death of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
[00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:20.638]  They went after him on a sex thing, because that's isolated to just that.
[00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.481]  And that's probably what's going to end up happening here.
[00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:26.022]  I think it's a balance of power thing.
[00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:27.243]  That's happening.
[00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:30.026]  But again, we know this is a big scandal.
[00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:31.748]  We know it's bigger than what they're saying.
[00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:33.450]  We know it's an intelligence operation.
[00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.052]  We know they knew about Benghazi.
[00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:36.013]  We know they lied about it.
[00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:37.615]  The question is who's behind it?
[00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:38.516]  What are the real players?
[00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:39.817]  What's the outcome going to be?
[00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:41.820]  I don't think we really know that yet.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.363]  You can speculate, but I want proof.
[00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:46.005]  Go ahead and make your other points, sir.
[00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:54.678]  Well, real quick, it's just ironic that, you know, Hillary Clinton is going away, Petraeus isn't going to testify.
[00:02:54.698 --> 00:03:03.065]  It's just really shady, and that, on top of all the executive orders Obama passed in his first four years, should have been frightening enough.
[00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:04.866]  And that gets me to my point.
[00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:05.867]  But he gave us a phone!
[00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:07.147]  He's going to do more, I'm sorry.
[00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.889]  Oh, it's crazy.
[00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:14.233]  And, you know, you've got people like that idiot Eric from New York calling up yesterday.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:26.344]  Um, you know, the thing that disgusts me the most is it seems like the globalist double standard has trickled down to the dumbed-down masses.
[00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:27.604]  I mean... Oh, no, no, no.
[00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:34.807]  They think it's good to kill other people so they have more room in there, but they don't understand they're being killed, too.
[00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:35.607]  Is that what you were going to say?
[00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:44.510]  Yeah, well, you know, it doesn't make sense that the average person... I mean, your son is more intelligent than 90% of the people in this country.
[00:03:45.206 --> 00:03:49.008]  And, you know, these guys, they could kill, we kill, we go to jail.
[00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:51.949]  They could sell drugs, we sell drugs, we go to jail.
[00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:58.131]  They could push away vaccines, we push away vaccines on our kids, they have CPS come snatch up our children.
[00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:12.137]  You know, and it's trickled down to the people, and you have, you know, I live in the Bronx, unfortunately it's bittersweet, I understand it's a police city state, I understand that, but I got, I'm Italian, I got a lot of people
[00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:14.477]  Or African American.
[00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:16.560]  They're not dumbed down and ignorant.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:30.978]  And people forget, when Planned Parenthood was created, they used people who were the black faces of the society movements, and used them to push their eugenics on the black society.
[00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.131]  And yet you have all these people.
[00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:37.895]  If you're white and you didn't vote for Obama, you vote for a white guy, you're racist.
[00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:43.539]  No, no, that's what's crazy is that I'm like, hey, they're killing half the black people in abortions.
[00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:44.460]  The guy's like, I don't care.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.900]  I love it.
[00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:45.901]  You're racist.
[00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:51.265]  And I'm like, I mean, I'm telling you, man, it's sick because I'm telling you, I've been around those type of people.
[00:04:52.106 --> 00:05:00.332]  We got a bunch of video clubs, so we're going to air it soon where there's black folks saying, yeah, kill the little nappy head black kids, because it's this idea of kill somebody, I'll get more.
[00:05:00.352 --> 00:05:01.273]  It's amazing.
[00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:07.422]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.685]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.067]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:17.852]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:24.177]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:27.640]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.923]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:37.167]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:37.428 --> 00:05:38.308]  And here's the best news.
[00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:42.151]  A remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now that gets you $1,700.
[00:05:43.072 --> 00:05:43.572]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:13.038]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:24.204]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[00:06:24.664 --> 00:06:31.948]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:39.071]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.813]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[00:06:44.194 --> 00:07:01.542]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver, and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing, please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home, forever.
[00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:08.761]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.524]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:07:11.544 --> 00:07:11.944]  The U.S.
[00:07:12.004 --> 00:07:16.128]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:18.811]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.452]  They want that attack to come.
[00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:26.879]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.723]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:34.711]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:42.343]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:45.204]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:07:45.404 --> 00:07:48.045]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:52.727]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:08:04.062 --> 00:08:09.627]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:12.790]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:13.651 --> 00:08:24.380]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:37.751]  Eastern, we are here live and it is now the 13th day of November 2012.
[00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:45.675]  We are seeing massive geopolitical movements worldwide.
[00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:50.197]  We are seeing incredible movements inside the military-industrial complex.
[00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:58.500]  What you're seeing from my perspective, we'll get Dr. Pucinich's take on this, is soft power coups going on back and forth.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.281]  You have the FBI on record
[00:09:02.062 --> 00:09:14.636]  And even Judge Andrew Napolitano is saying this is clearly illegal unconstitutional spying on the CIA director without warrants because another woman who was involved in the
[00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:22.021]  Hospitality, a volunteer at the Special Forces Command Basis.
[00:09:22.382 --> 00:09:28.184]  She was a volunteer there helping the men in social services.
[00:09:28.244 --> 00:09:29.985]  She was a social volunteer.
[00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:31.406]  What a nice lady.
[00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:39.150]  And you've got the head of the Afghanistan operations sending her thousands of inappropriate, according to the Associated Press, emails.
[00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.572]  DrudgeReport.com has it all, calling it a four-star circus.
[00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:45.955]  InfoWars.com has it all as well.
[00:09:45.975 --> 00:09:47.557]  So does PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:47.577 --> 00:09:53.181]  We're streaming video right now for radio listeners that they like to watch at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:57.064]  So you can see all these articles and documents and photos that we're talking about.
[00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:05.948]  But I remember just a few days after the Benghazi situation, we had Dr. Steve Pchenik on, who is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:15.311]  He confronted a few months ago the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dempsey at the CFR and said, you know, that he needed to go public and say, don't attack
[00:10:17.152 --> 00:10:20.915]  Iran, that later even came out in the news months after he talked about it.
[00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:25.179]  And to his credit, Dempsey went public and said it's a suicide mission.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.444]  Just as many as the Israelis are saying it's going to be a catastrophe, including the former Mossad chief.
[00:10:30.924 --> 00:10:39.632]  Instead of using soft power against Iran, some want to go to this larger regional war that will probably lead to a third world war, at least conventional world war.
[00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.226]  And you saw Benghazi.
[00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:44.668]  We know it didn't go five hours, it went seven hours.
[00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:45.889]  We know there's been a cover-up.
[00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:47.550]  We know it was an orchestrated attack.
[00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.593]  Why did the White House come out and say it wasn't an orchestrated attack?
[00:10:51.673 --> 00:11:00.959]  Then Dr. Pichinik said it was a neocon internal government operation as a false flag, October surprise, to knock out Obama.
[00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:04.622]  He's been critical of Obama, saying the bin Laden story was a hoax.
[00:11:04.662 --> 00:11:06.103]  He said it ten years ago on my show.
[00:11:06.423 --> 00:11:07.704]  He said it right after it happened.
[00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:08.805]  Then that started to come out.
[00:11:09.165 --> 00:11:14.587]  Stratford responded, the mainstream media responded, and said that a lot of the intelligence community weren't buying it.
[00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:22.030]  So this became a big international story, but also within internal intelligence it became really big.
[00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.152]  And Dr. Pucinich was approached by different spy agencies, Mossad, CIA, you name it.
[00:11:27.952 --> 00:11:30.013]  I was approached off record and asked to shut up.
[00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:30.993]  I have not shut up.
[00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:32.974]  I have been threatened as well.
[00:11:33.855 --> 00:11:37.056]  So, you know, at a certain point, even though I researched this stuff,
[00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:40.198]  No exaggeration, 18 hours a day and even dream about it.
[00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:43.960]  Because once you get obsessed with something and you've got a decent brain, the world opens up.
[00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:46.222]  I'm not sure what's going on.
[00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:47.103]  I know there's a cover-up.
[00:11:47.483 --> 00:11:50.265]  I know it was an attempted false flag at some level.
[00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:54.908]  I know there were missiles at that facility, the thousands that are missing, to be shipped into Syria.
[00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:55.809]  That's now come out.
[00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.010]  We said that a month ago.
[00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.211]  Dr. Tarpley and others did.
[00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:03.272]  We know that the ambassador was starting to become critical of what was happening.
[00:12:03.532 --> 00:12:04.612]  That's since been confirmed.
[00:12:04.632 --> 00:12:05.493]  Pchenik said that.
[00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:07.273]  So that backs up some of what he's saying.
[00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:14.815]  But I don't get, and we're going to walk through this here today, I want him to give us the big picture first and simplify it, then get into more details.
[00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:27.378]  I don't get if it's some type of internal false flag October surprise against Obama because certain power structures wanted to control the military industrial complex trough.
[00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:30.225]  And wanted a hot war against Iran.
[00:12:30.605 --> 00:12:34.910]  Why Obama stood down, why he lied about it, why he gave the press conferences, why the U.S.
[00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:43.077]  ambassador to the U.N., Rice, shed on all the different news shows that Sunday after, it happened the day after, that it was just a protest gone wrong.
[00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:48.263]  Why the cover-up if it was a black op against him?
[00:12:48.963 --> 00:12:51.586]  Okay, and now why are they purging Petraeus?
[00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.969]  Why are they purging the head of AFRICOM?
[00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.332]  Why are they purging who was over Benghazi?
[00:12:56.653 --> 00:13:00.958]  Why are they purging the head of the Afghanistan operation?
[00:13:00.998 --> 00:13:04.122]  This is all happening, all connected to this one woman.
[00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:08.216]  Is this woman a operative?
[00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.218]  Is this woman what they call a honeypot?
[00:13:10.258 --> 00:13:11.338]  That's a question we're going to ask.
[00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:19.644]  And Dr. Pachinik, again, is an MD, PhD, and American psychiatrist, trained and served under Kissinger, former State Department official, author, and publisher.
[00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:25.627]  He, of course, has written many, co-written many of the Tom Clancy books, been turned into major movies and TV shows and series.
[00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:32.672]  He's a critically acclaimed author of psycho-political thrillers and co-creator of the best-selling Tom Clancy's Op Center and NetForce, just to name a few.
[00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:39.815]  He's trained in psychiatry at Harvard University, international relations at the same time, only got to have two degrees at the same time, MIT.
[00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:48.919]  His novels are based on over 20 years experience resolving international crises and hostage situations for the Department of State for Foreign Administration, stevepachinick.com.
[00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.061]  Notice he's revamped and upgraded his site, looks really good.
[00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:58.764]  And of course, if you really look up his name, he's been involved in overthrows of governments, using psych warfare to get people to kill.
[00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:08.030]  You know, if we're talking about this on air, but the London Telegraph, if you can correct me if I'm wrong, says that he tricked the Communists into killing the Italian Prime Minister, things like that.
[00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.971]  So he's a serious guy.
[00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:10.312]  He joins us now.
[00:14:10.692 --> 00:14:12.013]  Sir, I know I've thrown a lot out there.
[00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:12.753]  That's what I do.
[00:14:12.773 --> 00:14:14.254]  Everybody kind of gets some of the pieces.
[00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:16.836]  I want to start with the big picture.
[00:14:17.277 --> 00:14:20.219]  You said that there were internal jockeying and things going on.
[00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:31.366]  I'd like to start with Petraeus and what's happening now, lead that into Benghazi, lead that into Bin Laden, and what the power structure's doing right now with the internal tectonic fissures.
[00:14:31.867 --> 00:14:33.288]  Dr. Pachanek, thank you for joining us.
[00:14:34.148 --> 00:14:35.850]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on the show.
[00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.511]  Let me start with number one.
[00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:49.621]  Basically, what Petraeus is doing is doing what all generals have done previously, is to basically fall on the sword of immolation, basically to take himself out.
[00:14:50.279 --> 00:15:01.530]  Because he probably did not agree with the decision to General Dempsey, Bonetta, and what I call the choir boys, the people who, Donlan, Brandon, the President himself.
[00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.094]  What this really is, is an internal fight.
[00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:18.580]  Between what is the military culture, which is rising, something I encourage, against the civilian culture, which was really dominated by the CIA, an antiquated CIA.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:33.788]  And it's been a power structure fight for a very, very long time, over 20 years, probably starting with back to the Bush Senior, going through the Clinton administration, where you had two different types of cultures trying to dominate our foreign policy.
[00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:38.488]  And it was much more Machiavellian than anybody realized.
[00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:39.629]  It was behind the scenes.
[00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:53.877]  What you have is a CIA that's really dysfunctional, that is consisting of people who have never really been able to acclimate to the new world, to a world which has become more electronic, more precise, more incisive.
[00:15:54.117 --> 00:15:57.078]  And what happened is you have a lot of men who are in the 70s and 80s,
[00:15:58.675 --> 00:16:00.596]  Many of them were alcoholics who I treated.
[00:16:00.756 --> 00:16:02.897]  Many of them came out of the Catholic religion.
[00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:04.557]  I have nothing against Catholicism.
[00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:16.862]  People like Dempsey, who was the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Brannon, Donnellan, all of whom really were not very qualified to run anything other than a series of past failures.
[00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:17.903]  I'll give you an example.
[00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:23.225]  Brannon, who is now the counterterrorism head, was in charge of the towers that blew up in
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:51.219]  Saudi Arabia, he's a totally incompetent station chief who's been an advisor to not only Clinton, but went through Bush Jr., was involved in 9-11, the original 9-11, and has created a total series of false narratives that the CIA has been very, not effective in doing, including the 9-11 Osama bin Laden story, the Osama bin Laden raid, which was false, and now it finally came to the confrontation of Benghazi.
[00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:52.920]  Benghazi is really the
[00:16:53.584 --> 00:16:57.265]  The trigger point of the entire conflict between our U.S.
[00:16:57.325 --> 00:17:17.152]  military, which is a highly trained, very precise organization, which would not tolerate the ad hoc or the kind of willy-nilly efforts of the CIA to create all kinds of conflicts, and the incompetence of our civilian government, including Obama, including Hillary Clinton,
[00:17:17.634 --> 00:17:23.003]  We've had a history of men who have died all along the side who've allowed men to die.
[00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:23.945]  Remember Foster?
[00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:30.696]  She herself has been a very disastrous figure in our foreign policy going all the way back to Bill Clinton.
[00:17:31.514 --> 00:17:37.096]  She encouraged him not to get involved in the killing and the massacre of 800,000 people in Rwanda.
[00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:37.956]  Nobody knows about that.
[00:17:37.976 --> 00:17:38.416]  Sure, Doc.
[00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:43.998]  Listen, I'm going to give you the floor to get into all this, but just for listeners tuning in right now, I understand some of the background.
[00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:46.739]  You're talking to people out there in government, not just the audience.
[00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.220]  But, I mean, come on.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.021]  You've got the same woman connected to all these generals.
[00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:51.761]  You've got...
[00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:53.222]  Forget about the woman.
[00:17:53.422 --> 00:18:00.209]  Alex, what I want you to remember, all of this is what we call a cover story and a honey trap that doesn't really exist.
[00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:03.753]  Whatever the story is, we're talking about characters now.
[00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:05.695]  We're the real bigger picture.
[00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:07.577]  You've got to pull back, Alex, for a minute.
[00:18:07.977 --> 00:18:12.342]  The real picture now is what happens when you have a military that was led by Petraeus.
[00:18:12.822 --> 00:18:23.486]  Taking over the CIA and saying that you're going to have to now not work a loosey-goosey and out of control as you've been doing it for 20, 30 years, but you're going to be a militarized service.
[00:18:23.946 --> 00:18:28.048]  And so what happened, a lot of the CIA is no longer what we have civilians.
[00:18:28.548 --> 00:18:32.830]  We have really outsourced special forces who have been on contracts.
[00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:40.032]  So basically our entire covert operation institution has been contract officers who make a lot of money, $250,000, ex-special forces.
[00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:51.244]  And we have the military, who's been standing by and being told what to do and to go into areas that they don't want to create wars.
[00:18:51.345 --> 00:18:55.109]  For example, in Libya, there was no reason whatsoever to take down Gaddafi.
[00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.591]  Absolutely no reason.
[00:18:57.072 --> 00:19:02.098]  There was no reason whatsoever to go into Syria, to take down Syria.
[00:19:02.838 --> 00:19:20.088]  So now it's purely about the payday and if they continue this, even if there's a corrupt power structure, there's not going to be an America left if these mercenaries continue to get in the way of the real, you know, national goals and national interest of this nation.
[00:19:20.108 --> 00:19:20.728]  That's correct.
[00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:31.034]  The mercenaries was a problem that was brought up to me by the General, actually the Special Forces General ten years ago when he asked me what I think would be the next
[00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:37.952]  ...next major enemies of the United States, and I said the mercenaries that we're creating... Okay, Doc, we gotta go to break.
[00:19:38.012 --> 00:19:51.762]  Humor me when we come back, and recap what you're really saying happened in Benghazi, and then let's get into what's happening with Petraeus, because clearly the FBI and the Justice Department is now spying on generals without warrants.
[00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:55.846]  This is some type of internal battle coup operation.
[00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:57.727]  I want you to put it in layman's terms.
[00:19:58.047 --> 00:19:59.829]  Talk to me like I'm six years old, Doc.
[00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.729]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:01.170]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.624 --> 00:20:08.426]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:08.786 --> 00:20:11.547]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:11.808 --> 00:20:14.169]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:16.810]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.051]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:24.873]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:20:36.979 --> 00:20:38.599]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:33.037]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:33.217 --> 00:22:37.558]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:37.738 --> 00:22:43.399]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:43.499 --> 00:22:46.880]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.681]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:54.662]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:14.817]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S., and you have got to be prepared.
[00:23:15.377 --> 00:23:19.378]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:31.600]  So if there is any interruption in our fragile food supply chain, or even a hint of a crisis, then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes, and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:41.848]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now before it's too late.

[00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:57.641]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[00:23:58.122 --> 00:23:59.263]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:09.169]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.130]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:32.202 --> 00:24:34.384]  Okay, Dr. Steve Pachenik is our guest.
[00:24:34.404 --> 00:24:36.466]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:36.927 --> 00:24:40.951]  I just want to revisit this because you were on us a month or so ago.
[00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:51.141]  You said that it was an Israeli neocon coup, from the information you had, against
[00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:58.167]  The Obama administration, who you've been critical of, but you were saying there were all these internal power structure coups.
[00:24:58.627 --> 00:25:00.228]  I'd like to hear the evidence of that.
[00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:03.889]  Now in the aftermath, why would Obama then try to cover up?
[00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.050]  Why wouldn't he send aid?
[00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.151]  There was a CIA torture base right down the street.
[00:25:09.292 --> 00:25:11.473]  Why is all this going on and how does it tie into
[00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:14.354]  Five generals now in the last month.
[00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:19.458]  The head of AFRICOM, the head of the Afghan operation, now Petraeus and one other.
[00:25:19.478 --> 00:25:22.400]  I guess Petraeus was the head of CENTCOM.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.263]  I mean, I mean, I mean, this is getting, this is getting really, really crazy.
[00:25:27.283 --> 00:25:33.968]  And obviously there's seismic, you know, the ground is rumbling in Washington and we're being told it's about these women.
[00:25:34.168 --> 00:25:35.549]  I know that's a distraction.
[00:25:35.849 --> 00:25:37.030]  I know that's the cover story.
[00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.050]  I get that.
[00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.612]  But I'm saying what's deeper, Dr. Pachinik.
[00:25:40.632 --> 00:25:42.033]  So let's start at Benghazi, please, sir.
[00:25:42.813 --> 00:25:52.158]  Alright, the Benghazi issue was a totally illegal operation which was signed off by the President of the United States who, remember, is part of the CIA.
[00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:53.639]  His mother was CIA.
[00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:55.740]  His grandfather was CIA.
[00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:57.641]  He was trained in the CIA.
[00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:03.084]  What you have here is the CIA versus the military conflict going on.
[00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:08.167]  And you have basically an out-of-control foreign policy that's run by mercenaries
[00:26:08.837 --> 00:26:16.835]  And by a military that refuses to engage in civilian intrusions into Libya and Syria.
[00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:19.561]  And what happened in Benghazi was that the ambassador
[00:26:20.649 --> 00:26:28.132]  Clearly murdered under the direction of Hillary Clinton, who has had a history of allowing people to die and men to die.
[00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:35.074]  So, the consulate was really used as a center for, as I said before, RPGs for torture.
[00:26:35.354 --> 00:26:42.837]  Now, they had the mercenaries, the SEALs, and several Libyan and other foreigners.
[00:26:43.547 --> 00:26:48.030]  In the embassy and the consulate, which was used to torture the victims.
[00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.353]  And basically this was a totally illegal operation, which did have a finding.
[00:26:53.393 --> 00:26:57.396]  When I say it's illegal, it means that it's illegal by the International Court of Law.
[00:26:57.416 --> 00:27:00.158]  It's illegal by using the embassy or consulate.
[00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.219]  It's an illegal usage.
[00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:03.500]  So what you have here is
[00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:13.334]  Military fighting, the CIA basically, and the military coup that was beginning to say, we no longer want to listen to the President of the United States.
[00:27:13.374 --> 00:27:15.014]  We're tired of listening to the Bushes.
[00:27:15.414 --> 00:27:16.975]  We're tired of listening to Obama.
[00:27:17.315 --> 00:27:21.597]  We're tired of listening to Panetta, who really has no credibility.
[00:27:21.657 --> 00:27:27.059]  And we were tired of listening to Dempsey, who I had warned a month before, as I told you, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:38.922]  Would you ever stand up to the President of the United States and in his lilting Irish kind of leprechaun abasiveness, he gave me such bullshit, I would have fired him then and there.
[00:27:39.343 --> 00:27:47.849]  But the real issue was that General Hamm, the career admiral in charge of a carrier task force, were watching their own men being killed.
[00:27:48.476 --> 00:27:59.563]  In a place where illegally the operation was not legal, but nevertheless, these were their soldiers, their special forces, and all over the world, we could monitor this for eight hours.
[00:27:59.743 --> 00:28:15.593]  No, no, and you said this a month ago, they had two drones over, so why don't the generals come out and say, you made us stand down and go public, because if what you're saying is right, and I agree that's where this is pointing, then they're going to end up killing these guys before they can come out and blow the whistle.
[00:28:16.226 --> 00:28:17.567]  Let me tell you, Alex, why.
[00:28:17.627 --> 00:28:36.201]  Because we have created, and this is why it's important for our public to understand, and I've said it for a long time, we have created a General Corps that is not consistent with what we had in World War II, when we had a George Marshall who would fire 600 generals in minutes and in hours because they would not stand for it.
[00:28:36.742 --> 00:28:39.684]  And instead of standing down, they should have never stood down.
[00:28:40.244 --> 00:28:41.706]  Ham should never have stood down.
[00:28:41.766 --> 00:28:43.607]  The Rear Admiral should never have stood down.
[00:28:44.047 --> 00:28:45.849]  None of them should have stood down because
[00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:57.660]  The field teams that were in there, the special forces that were in there, were told that they would have overhead cover, but they marked the entire consulate to say, look, we have to blow this up.
[00:28:58.181 --> 00:29:04.287]  And instead, what we've had is a military, which has wanted to assert power, has backed down because several reasons.
[00:29:04.607 --> 00:29:09.652]  Number one, America has to understand our military now is a non-functional military.
[00:29:10.112 --> 00:29:23.822]  It is filled with generals who have never really been in war, who are really concerned about getting more medals and more positions, but have never asserted their aggressiveness or their warlike attitudes, which they should have.
[00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:30.409]  And basically, they're making $3 million when they leave the government and they go on to go to the Elf Creek.
[00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:31.350]  Okay, break it down.
[00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.933]  This is riveting and it makes sense and you did call it early on.
[00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:35.633]  I'm not saying it.
[00:29:35.793 --> 00:29:40.517]  I'm saying our military has been dysfunctional for the past 20 to 30 years.
[00:29:41.017 --> 00:29:46.921]  However, we developed a small corps of generals whom I've worked with, whether it was Petraeus or others.
[00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:47.842]  Okay, stay there, Doc.
[00:29:47.862 --> 00:29:48.562]  We gotta go to break.
[00:29:48.582 --> 00:29:50.043]  Satellites cutting in.
[00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:50.464]  Here we go.
[00:29:51.687 --> 00:29:54.689]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.595 --> 00:30:07.438]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:10.721]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:30:10.921 --> 00:30:13.102]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:30:13.363 --> 00:30:17.886]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:30:18.166 --> 00:30:24.207]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:27.668]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:30:28.008 --> 00:30:31.929]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:30:32.189 --> 00:30:37.191]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:38.311]  And here's the best news.

[00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:07.893]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:31:08.253 --> 00:31:11.035]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:31:11.275 --> 00:31:13.597]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:31:13.817 --> 00:31:16.339]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:19.502]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:31:19.802 --> 00:31:24.346]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:31:36.435 --> 00:31:38.016]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:05.687]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flus and other illnesses.
[00:32:06.027 --> 00:32:07.447]  Make sure you're not one of them.

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:13.387]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:14.168 --> 00:33:15.209]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:15.729 --> 00:33:19.392]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.786]  I am Alex Jones, waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies of disinformation.
[00:33:35.027 --> 00:33:42.815]  I have traveled around the world, and I'm telling you the United States is one of the best places to live, and my ancestors have been here on the Mayflower.
[00:33:43.756 --> 00:33:49.122]  And even longer, I'm part Native American, and I don't want to see my republic go into a complete tyranny.
[00:33:50.165 --> 00:33:51.366]  And we are all in grave danger.
[00:33:51.386 --> 00:33:53.087]  We're going to talk about what this means.
[00:33:53.148 --> 00:34:01.374]  There's obviously a giant battle between the intelligence agencies, the FBI, and the Defense Department.
[00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:02.275]  That's undoubted.
[00:34:02.956 --> 00:34:07.420]  A general sent thousands of inappropriate emails to a woman who reported harassment by Petraeus Miskeras.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.184]  FBI agent banned from probe after he grew obsessed and sent her shirtless photos.
[00:34:14.105 --> 00:34:17.349]  A bombshell story is just a smokescreen for something bigger.
[00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:23.077]  That's what the father of Petraeus' biographer girlfriend has said.
[00:34:23.097 --> 00:34:25.440]  And he says it's about to come out.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.666]  Local TV station mistakenly airs altered sexually suggestive version of Broadwell's book cover.
[00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:34.017]  This is a big battle inside government.
[00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:35.898]  They're talking about impeachment of Obama.
[00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:38.800]  They're talking about this being the new Watergate.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:50.728]  We're going to cover it with Dr. Steve Pucinich of stevepucinich.com, high-level former intelligence operator, head of psych warfare for the State Department, worked on peace deals with
[00:34:51.628 --> 00:35:00.892]  Of course, Egypt and Israel successfully, they're at Camp David, and he is, you know, giving us his inside scoop, member of the Council on Foreign Relations on what's happening.
[00:35:01.172 --> 00:35:09.335]  We're going back to him to give him the floor here in one moment to go out of Benghazi to the battle that's happening, where he sees it going, and why the generals didn't.
[00:35:10.492 --> 00:35:13.474]  Come out with this, because it's now confirmed the military sat there and watched.
[00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:14.235]  That's been confirmed.
[00:35:14.275 --> 00:35:16.377]  Colonel Schaefer agrees with a lot of what Pachinik's saying.
[00:35:16.417 --> 00:35:17.878]  He says it was a hit, a murder.
[00:35:18.378 --> 00:35:24.083]  He just says, you know, it looks like some elements want missiles to get to al-Qaeda, because that's good for military business.
[00:35:24.683 --> 00:35:26.344]  That's basically what Pachinik's saying.
[00:35:26.965 --> 00:35:30.788]  This is about arming al-Qaeda for the next stage.
[00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:33.009]  Will that be terror attacks here, or use it to take our liberties?
[00:35:33.029 --> 00:35:34.451]  We'll talk to Dr. Pachinik in a moment.
[00:35:35.188 --> 00:35:37.329]  First off, we are listener-supported.
[00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:58.734]  When you support our local AM and FM stations by supporting their sponsors or becoming a sponsor, whether you're listening to us in Tampa, Florida or Chicago, Illinois, Austin, Texas or Rochester, New York, it is so important, whether you're listening in Oregon or New Mexico, to spread the word about those local AM and FM stations and support the local sponsors or become a sponsor.
[00:35:58.754 --> 00:36:00.054]  The show is really expanding.
[00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.535]  I want to welcome all the new listeners.
[00:36:02.572 --> 00:36:16.626]  Also, it's important when you go to InfoWars.com, we carry the best products I've found that I personally use, like eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, to get their best discounts on high-quality, storable foods in case this depression really gets bad.
[00:36:16.686 --> 00:36:17.768]  It's good to have that backup.
[00:36:18.408 --> 00:36:19.529]  It's important to go to the site.
[00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.450]  I think?
[00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:39.551]  Well, they have the Traveler unit, stainless steel, next to the competition.
[00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:42.053]  We'll go look at the side-by-side to its leading competitors.
[00:36:42.493 --> 00:36:43.594]  It is numero uno.
[00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:46.096]  It's what I use in my home and here at the office.
[00:36:46.656 --> 00:36:50.139]  So ProPure, available at infowarestore.com.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.525]  And we have the new survival film about safest areas in the country and even outside big cities, the safest sub-areas.
[00:36:57.085 --> 00:36:57.906]  Okay, Doc, you got the floor.
[00:36:57.946 --> 00:36:59.547]  We got 15 minutes left in the segment now.
[00:36:59.567 --> 00:37:02.009]  I'm going to stand down here, roll through it in layman's terms.
[00:37:02.029 --> 00:37:02.409]  Benghazi,
[00:37:22.344 --> 00:37:29.909]  What this signifies, where it's now going, why these generals are all leaving, what this signifies, you know, shouldn't they be speaking out?
[00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:32.510]  We know they sat there while those people were murdered.
[00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:34.071]  Who was really behind that?
[00:37:34.131 --> 00:37:35.052]  Where is it all going?
[00:37:35.072 --> 00:37:35.772]  What do you predict?
[00:37:35.792 --> 00:37:51.262]  Number one, the Benghazi episode has been the culmination of illegal operations that have been done under the CIA with Petraeus, first with Panetta, who was DTI, and basically the CIA is no longer
[00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:52.559]  We're good.
[00:38:21.863 --> 00:38:22.684]  Drone attacks.
[00:38:23.244 --> 00:38:26.046]  They have a much more sophisticated approach to the world.
[00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:27.407]  They're much more precise.
[00:38:27.908 --> 00:38:28.909]  They follow orders.
[00:38:29.149 --> 00:38:37.055]  Unfortunately, the military watched a series of attacks occurring in Benghazi with an illegal operation.
[00:38:37.295 --> 00:38:49.125]  Legal meaning literally it was illegal, using the cover of a consulate, which is an illegal cover, to use torture of Libyan prisoners and foreign prisoners.
[00:38:49.685 --> 00:39:04.347]  Which we were interrogating repeatedly, and the CIA denied that, and was also supplying weapons into Syria in a misbegotten type of foreign policy which was initiated by Hillary Clinton, Obama,
[00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:08.549]  Valerie Jarrett and the people in the White House.
[00:39:09.029 --> 00:39:16.192]  So we've been running an incredible amount of secret wars under Obama, where normally we should have known about it.
[00:39:16.332 --> 00:39:17.833]  Our Congress has never covered it.
[00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:23.376]  And we have had more wars and covert operations under him than any other president I know.
[00:39:24.276 --> 00:39:29.959]  And since he's come out of the CIA, he's run by the CIA, what you have here is a cultural clash
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:43.965]  Between military generals who refuse to continue to listen to civilian authority, and I have encouraged that through my lectures at the war colleges, my meetings with the generals, saying that at some point in time, you generals will have to stand up.
[00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:52.448]  Civilian leaders who led us into the war in Vietnam, who led us into the wars in Iraq, who led us into Afghanistan, you have performed poorly.
[00:39:52.928 --> 00:39:54.849]  You have performed exceedingly poorly.
[00:39:54.869 --> 00:39:57.910]  You have destroyed the integrity of the military and the army.
[00:39:59.488 --> 00:40:03.823]  These generals watched while their own men were being killed and said nothing.
[00:40:04.224 --> 00:40:04.425]  Yeah.
[00:40:04.918 --> 00:40:05.758]  It's unfortunate.
[00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:08.099]  They should have said something.
[00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.240]  They should have stood forward.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:20.864]  And instead, they were given the cover story by Dempsey, who's a total coward, someone I met, had total disrespect for, and Panetta, another coward who should be impeached and in the White House.
[00:40:21.424 --> 00:40:23.865]  And in turn, they were told to stand down.
[00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:34.049]  But what was happening in the middle of all of this Benghazi episode was the fact that not only was a Navy rear admiral and a carrier task force sent back, which is unheard of,
[00:40:34.509 --> 00:40:46.163]  And they were ready to protect our soldiers after seven hours of an attack, where these special forces units were literally putting their lives on the line to say, look, save us.
[00:40:46.303 --> 00:40:48.626]  And they were told that they would be saved, but they weren't.
[00:40:49.235 --> 00:41:05.105]  Basically what happened is, this was an attempt by the White House, by Panetta, by all the men in the CIA from the old days, like Brannan, who should have been indicted for war criminals under 9-11, 2001, who's a continuing problem.
[00:41:06.066 --> 00:41:09.788]  Donilon, who should have been indicted for criminal activities under 9-11.
[00:41:11.045 --> 00:41:20.287]  And this is all a combination where the military did not do what they should have done, which was to refuse the civilian order and be treasonous, as I have been repeatedly.
[00:41:21.707 --> 00:41:25.068]  Defied civilian order to save the lives of our military men.
[00:41:25.209 --> 00:41:27.490]  I'm ashamed of our military for having done that.
[00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:50.860]  I'm sorry that they did it, but basically what's happened is that there was a fear in the White House, and a correct fear, that part of what I had been doing and others had been doing was to develop a military corps of generals, which Petraeus is part of, say that we will no longer follow civilian orders, meaning that the civilians who've come to power are President Bush Jr.
[00:41:51.958 --> 00:41:53.031]  Uh, excellent.
[00:41:53.675 --> 00:41:56.816]  And Obama really knows nothing about foreign policy.
[00:41:56.956 --> 00:42:04.259]  And the people who they picked, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powers, Brandon, all of these people are incompetent.
[00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:22.647]  They've had a history of incompetence in their ideologues, and they basically wanted to go into countries like Libya and overthrow Gaddafi, who was our ally for years, and create stories that really were not even rational, and claim that we would create an Arab Spring, when in fact they had no solution as to what that meant.
[00:42:23.388 --> 00:42:24.409]  And where that was going.
[00:42:24.889 --> 00:42:34.220]  And in Benghazi, this was the final point of where the military and the civilians, or the CIA, came to a clash of who was in charge.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:41.629]  And it was clear that at this point in time, the President committed not only a legal act to abuse the State Department as a cover,
[00:42:42.222 --> 00:43:01.154]  For torture and and extradition as well as as well as sending a weapon illegally into Syria on rebels where we have never declared war but at the same time it was the clash to allow the civilian to get rid of all those generals who in any way could be defying the White House.
[00:43:01.254 --> 00:43:03.355]  So this is really a coup attempt.
[00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:10.460]  This was a taking down of a real military coup to say we've had enough.
[00:43:11.027 --> 00:43:15.810]  And unfortunately, our military backed down, and they will pay a heavy price for it.
[00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:22.114]  Fourteen other Navy commanders were dismissed during this period, and that was not written about.
[00:43:22.574 --> 00:43:33.621]  So that basically, the White House, under the direction of Brennan, who's a very dangerous CIA operative, who was involved in 9-11, should have been indicted for criminal activities under the 2000 Act.
[00:43:35.302 --> 00:43:41.787]  One 9-11, Donlan as well, and this gets into that specific issue.
[00:43:41.887 --> 00:43:49.732]  Now, the person who's missing in all of this, and the most important person who's never been talked about, is exactly the person you were talking about.
[00:43:50.152 --> 00:44:00.179]  And that's Mr. Bob Mueller, who for years I have warned that if he doesn't watch what he's doing, he should be under investigation, and should be the one who's being investigated.
[00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:10.571]  Mueller has had a very, very, very dangerous history of having come in before 9-11, one week beforehand, appointed by Bush Jr.
[00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:20.076]  to head up the FBI, and knew very well that his involvement in 9-11, the stand-down and the false attack that we had,
[00:44:20.843 --> 00:44:24.346]  And basically, he was covering that up with the FBI agents.
[00:44:24.546 --> 00:44:25.687]  There's no question about it.
[00:44:25.707 --> 00:44:34.794]  And by the way, his number two, just to briefly interject, was saying that they were going to allow an Al Qaeda attack as a pretext.
[00:44:34.814 --> 00:44:37.116]  He even gave newspaper interviews.
[00:44:37.176 --> 00:44:37.936]  John O'Neill.
[00:44:38.296 --> 00:44:40.378]  And then he died in the World Trade Center, we're told.
[00:44:40.638 --> 00:44:40.958]  Correct.
[00:44:41.259 --> 00:44:49.425]  And I knew about O'Neill because John O'Neill was the CIA operative who was sent to New York and the head of counterintelligence to the CIA told me about him.
[00:44:49.924 --> 00:44:51.005]  And he warned about it.
[00:44:51.445 --> 00:44:55.627]  Mueller should be investigated, should be indicted for war crimes.
[00:44:55.787 --> 00:45:00.669]  He is very much a part of this cover-up, and has been for a very long, long time.
[00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:05.051]  Mueller goes back, and so does the FBI, which should also be investigated.
[00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.173]  But unfortunately, we don't have investigative capability.
[00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:10.674]  Our Congress, our Senate is totally defunct.
[00:45:11.348 --> 00:45:16.329]  So we have to develop some kind of body where the American public comes in and says, you know what?
[00:45:16.809 --> 00:45:18.790]  Our congressmen and senators are useless.
[00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.230]  Our civilians are useless.
[00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:33.994]  But Mueller has to be investigated repeatedly for his involvement, not only in 9-11-2001 cover up the criminal activities, but now illegal operation against the military, the CIA.
[00:45:34.134 --> 00:45:39.015]  And it harks back to the time of J. Edgar Hoover, when he used the investigative powers
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.640]  We're good to go.
[00:46:02.646 --> 00:46:09.815]  For over 30 years, when I've worked with the FBI or the CIA, they have been the most least cooperative group I've ever seen.
[00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:14.181]  In particular, they also make up their own storylines, which is absolutely amazing.
[00:46:14.682 --> 00:46:17.886]  I was involved in the Hanafi Muslim, and they failed terribly.
[00:46:18.306 --> 00:46:20.187]  And I defied presidential order.
[00:46:20.587 --> 00:46:22.528]  And that was basically treason.
[00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:32.454]  I threw out the President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, and warned him that if he would have come back into the room, I would have 500 hostages killed as he started it.
[00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.672]  That was basically treason.
[00:46:35.153 --> 00:46:42.423]  At the same time, I committed treason when I overthrew someone in the Aldo Morrow kidnapping, and that's what we call a hard coup.
[00:46:42.803 --> 00:46:48.972]  There was no question that I overrode the CIA, overrode military orders, overrode civilian orders.
[00:46:49.412 --> 00:46:50.374]  But in my opinion,
[00:46:50.954 --> 00:46:55.716]  And at the directive of whoever it was, in my own opinion, I was able to do that.
[00:46:55.856 --> 00:46:58.117]  And for those years, nobody could understand it.
[00:46:58.197 --> 00:47:04.159]  That's why I was able to override the CIA and either fire or dismiss them or marginalize them.
[00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:06.460]  Well, now that you've told the Jimmy Carter story, I looked it up.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.622]  It's on record that you were the State Department representative at the famous Camp David Accord.
[00:47:11.642 --> 00:47:14.383]  We should have you on just about the history sometime.
[00:47:15.603 --> 00:47:19.664]  But let me get back to the story of why this happened.
[00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:20.885]  What happened with President Carter?
[00:47:21.965 --> 00:47:30.388]  Well, Jimmy Carter, President Carter had initially created, got himself involved in a bank hold up where he was micromanaging everything.
[00:47:30.468 --> 00:47:35.289]  And as a result of that, what happened was a man by the name of Khalid,
[00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:46.605]  Who saw his daughter drowned by the Elijah Muhammad group, held five different buildings hostages, including the B'nai B'rith, shot Mayor Barry, and we had 500 hostages.
[00:47:47.405 --> 00:47:48.966]  The FBI could not handle it.
[00:47:49.646 --> 00:47:51.487]  The CIA could not handle it.
[00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:54.568]  And I was called in the middle of the night to take it over.
[00:47:55.149 --> 00:47:58.890]  And Earl Silbert, who was at that time not my friend, but was the U.S.
[00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.171]  Attorney General, I told him that whatever happened,
[00:48:01.627 --> 00:48:02.768]  We'll be canceled.
[00:48:02.788 --> 00:48:03.989]  We'll have a gag order.
[00:48:04.129 --> 00:48:05.010]  No one is to talk.
[00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.371]  Nobody is to say anything.
[00:48:06.772 --> 00:48:08.773]  And I took over complete command and control.
[00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:11.756]  There were three ambassadors from my, uh, Yahoo!
[00:48:11.796 --> 00:48:17.140]  Khan from Pakistan, from Egypt, and from Iran, all of whom were just sitting there.
[00:48:17.181 --> 00:48:18.582]  So I provided the Quran.
[00:48:18.622 --> 00:48:25.568]  I quickly formulated the strategy and tactics where I took over the control of Khalees and told them that this is what's going to happen.
[00:48:25.888 --> 00:48:27.670]  Sure, and that's on record too.
[00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.011]  It sounds amazing to listeners.
[00:48:55.968 --> 00:48:57.089]  Let's expand on this.
[00:48:57.129 --> 00:48:58.090]  Let's expand on this then.
[00:48:59.091 --> 00:49:01.612]  I'm just letting people know the kind of stuff you've done and what you've seen.
[00:49:01.953 --> 00:49:05.615]  Where is this going now where mercenaries, because the U.S.
[00:49:05.655 --> 00:49:11.260]  has been corrupt for a long time and that's part of the whole Machiavellian system and you know when you dance with the devil you
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.262]  The devil doesn't change, you change.
[00:49:13.723 --> 00:49:21.854]  But now you can see it that what these mercenaries and the CIA and 80% of intelligence now run by private groups.
[00:49:22.234 --> 00:49:24.858]  I found an NSA base by my house and I've confirmed it.
[00:49:25.118 --> 00:49:26.641]  Well, it's a private group data mining.
[00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:27.802]  I mean, that's how bad it is.
[00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:28.764]  It's just everywhere now.
[00:49:29.244 --> 00:49:32.428]  They've made the American people their enemy, too, because that's a new battlefield for them.
[00:49:32.868 --> 00:49:34.610]  They don't care about long-term.
[00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.653]  Now they really just want their paychecks.
[00:49:37.073 --> 00:49:40.037]  You've got contractors, low-level, paid more than top generals.
[00:49:40.818 --> 00:49:46.024]  And so it's a private corporate coup that we see happening, and they brag about it.
[00:49:46.384 --> 00:49:47.706]  Where is it going, then?
[00:49:48.544 --> 00:50:08.273]  Well, it is going into a major confrontation with our military because for every mercenary who basically was either ex-special forces receives $250,000 and you put in a special forces legal soldier next to him and he's only making $40,000 or $50,000.
[00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:11.075]  You're going to get real conflicts.
[00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:26.324]  And I remember telling General Schumacher, the head of Special Forces, the head of the Army, ten years ago, that our major enemy within five to ten years, and it's right now about Benghazi, will be those mercenaries under L3, under Northrop Grumman,
[00:50:26.804 --> 00:50:35.670]  Under all the companies that have been outsourced, and Panetta has been one of the greatest users of these L3 communications, as has the CIA.
[00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.112]  By the way, they plan to use L3 domestically for civil unrest.
[00:50:39.432 --> 00:50:41.594]  They got a giant training base here in Texas.
[00:50:41.614 --> 00:50:42.014]  Stay there.
[00:50:42.034 --> 00:50:44.295]  I want to come back then and just zero in.
[00:50:44.856 --> 00:50:55.763]  Why did Obama stand down then, if it was some type of internal operation with the neocons wanting to get missiles, you know, into the next theater to expand the war?
[00:50:56.543 --> 00:51:00.505]  Why did Obama play into their hands, or has he joined up with these people?
[00:51:00.545 --> 00:51:01.886]  I mean, I want to zero in on this.
[00:51:03.067 --> 00:51:07.870]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.112]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:13.473]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:51:13.733 --> 00:51:18.216]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:24.462]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:51:24.762 --> 00:51:27.905]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:28.246 --> 00:51:32.129]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:37.314]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:37.575 --> 00:51:38.435]  And here's the best news.

[00:53:01.969 --> 00:53:06.071]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:53:06.732 --> 00:53:08.853]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:53:09.762 --> 00:53:18.110]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:53:18.731 --> 00:53:23.656]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:35.252]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[00:53:43.337 --> 00:53:47.598]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[00:53:47.638 --> 00:53:50.819]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[00:53:51.239 --> 00:53:58.201]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY, or visit carnivora.com.
[00:53:58.481 --> 00:53:59.501]  Protect your immune system.
[00:53:59.762 --> 00:54:00.822]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:54:00.842 --> 00:54:12.545]  A decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room with the Pentagon.
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:21.405]  When they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action of total commitment.
[00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:25.748]  Mandry, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?
[00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:29.970]  No, I didn't think I knew what he was talking about.
[00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.632]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[00:54:33.552 --> 00:54:37.695]  When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[00:54:38.495 --> 00:54:42.498]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[00:54:43.507 --> 00:54:49.756]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[00:54:51.478 --> 00:54:54.983]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:54:55.564 --> 00:54:57.327]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:01.873]  Okay, we got one more segment here, and then another.
[00:55:01.953 --> 00:55:04.334]  Two more segments, short ones, with Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[00:55:04.854 --> 00:55:07.076]  Riveting, powerful interview, unfortunately.
[00:55:07.456 --> 00:55:12.399]  So much is what he's saying, I can just verify from open intelligence, reading between the lines here.
[00:55:12.419 --> 00:55:24.707]  I was saying, isn't it about phasing out the military, converting it to a social enforcement thing domestically, everything going to drones, controlled by megacorporations that have hijacked our country?
[00:55:24.987 --> 00:55:27.109]  And he said, bingo, that's it.
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:30.711]  So, Dr. Pachanik, you also had another announcement you wanted to make about the CFR.
[00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:37.116]  Break down geopolitically where all this is going, because soon the mercenaries are going to be cut out of the equation, too.
[00:55:37.136 --> 00:55:42.679]  The New World Order, it likes robots, it likes drones, it likes drone subs and drone ships.
[00:55:42.719 --> 00:55:43.560]  Explain where we're going.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.422]  Basically, this is the end of the Army.
[00:55:46.982 --> 00:55:48.663]  We no longer really need an Army.
[00:55:48.803 --> 00:55:50.485]  It will be decreased in size.
[00:55:50.565 --> 00:55:51.025]  They know this.
[00:55:51.045 --> 00:55:52.286]  This is the end.
[00:55:52.446 --> 00:55:54.308]  We don't need Army units.
[00:55:54.328 --> 00:55:56.950]  We don't need the teeth-to-tail ratio.
[00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:03.035]  In other words, the amount of supply that we need to get actual fighters in who have not done well is very high.
[00:56:03.155 --> 00:56:11.902]  So basically, where we are going into is a new kind of warfare, which is space warfare, cyberwar, cyberattack, which is really very important.
[00:56:12.403 --> 00:56:13.764]  Does it belong to the Army?
[00:56:14.853 --> 00:56:26.119]  It really now belongs to a whole new concept which the United States has to begin to understand, which has to deal with private industry and working in cyber war and cyber security.
[00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:33.423]  Because the Army isn't necessarily designated or has been trained in cyber war and cyber attack, although they're interested in it.
[00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:37.405]  It's not the sine qua non of their reason.
[00:56:37.865 --> 00:56:40.807]  So what you have is the elimination of really war structures.
[00:56:41.317 --> 00:56:41.757]  We're good.
[00:56:57.279 --> 00:56:59.540]  Very, you know, retarded individuals.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.940]  But you got to get in Jemse's face there.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.040]  It's still useful for that.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.421]  Well, but Jemse is a coward.
[00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:10.262]  I mean, if I were what I normally was, George Marshall, I would have fired him on spot.
[00:57:10.402 --> 00:57:12.683]  I would have fired 600 generals on spot.
[00:57:13.023 --> 00:57:14.143]  We don't do that anymore.
[00:57:14.163 --> 00:57:15.503]  Instead, we promote the generals.
[00:57:15.523 --> 00:57:17.284]  We give them pensions for $3 million.
[00:57:17.584 --> 00:57:18.504]  So they're useless.
[00:57:18.664 --> 00:57:18.884]  Sure.
[00:57:18.944 --> 00:57:21.285]  Bottom line, where's it going with Obama then?
[00:57:21.665 --> 00:57:22.486]  How bad is this?
[00:57:22.506 --> 00:57:25.867]  Obama is going to be heading into a very serious problem of impeachment.
[00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:39.473]  If he continues all these wars that are illegal wars, which have not been overseen by the Congress, and are not the most effective Congress, but the American public understands that this is not just the President who quietly goes around and does what he does.
[00:57:39.813 --> 00:57:46.956]  He has been ordering these covert operations for years on end, and is a product of the CIA, and can no longer continue this.
[00:57:47.515 --> 00:57:54.881]  We will implode in terms of both our national security, and also our military will refuse to follow any more orders.
[00:57:54.981 --> 00:58:02.667]  And in particular, I talk about our Air Force, which is in space warfare, which has to do with satellite warfare, and our Navy.
[00:58:03.228 --> 00:58:12.235]  Because our Navy, when you talk about our Navy, nobody's really talked about our nuclear subs and our fleets, what we call SINCPAC, Commander of the
[00:58:12.978 --> 00:58:14.399]  Or the nuclear drone subs.
[00:58:14.459 --> 00:58:19.282]  They have those classified missile platforms that have been around for 20 years.
[00:58:20.042 --> 00:58:20.262]  Right.
[00:58:20.683 --> 00:58:23.064]  So some kind of deterrence is required.
[00:58:23.304 --> 00:58:25.766]  Are we going to be going into another major war?
[00:58:25.986 --> 00:58:26.186]  No.
[00:58:26.626 --> 00:58:40.535]  But we have created under Obama and the Bush administration more unnecessary wars thanks to the CIA, thanks to incompetent civilians and incompetent generals who wanted to just get their... Back in 60 seconds, Doc.
[00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:44.934]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:48.865]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.518 --> 00:58:55.601]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:58:55.981 --> 00:59:01.705]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:59:01.925 --> 00:59:08.330]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:13.935]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:59:14.215 --> 00:59:17.858]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:21.621]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:59:21.841 --> 00:59:26.224]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:37.092]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:59:37.232 --> 00:59:39.874]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:59:40.174 --> 00:59:46.696]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:59:46.996 --> 00:59:51.718]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[00:59:55.439 --> 00:59:57.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.601]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.912 --> 01:00:11.054]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.734 --> 01:00:12.534]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.314 --> 01:00:14.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:18.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:23.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.519 --> 01:00:29.580]  Wow, we were just talking about space-based weapons and how advanced they really are with Dr. McShannock.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.062]  Okay, we've got five minutes, Doc, and Larry Pratt's coming up, folks, on the assault on the Second Amendment.
[01:00:36.158 --> 01:00:39.239]  Government is getting more and more corrupt, more and more out of control.
[01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:42.220]  Look at the Secret Service and the hookers, all of it.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.001]  They've got all these super weapons, but they're starting all these wars.
[01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:48.322]  They're trying to convert America to the police state.
[01:00:48.682 --> 01:00:50.703]  What's the establishment's grand plan?
[01:00:51.403 --> 01:00:53.884]  And is there any way to turn it around in your view, Dr. Puccini?
[01:00:54.727 --> 01:01:02.430]  Yes, I think it's very easy that the American public now, yesterday, started requiring that states write that they wanted to secede from the Union.
[01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:10.534]  I think this is something I wrote about 10, 20 years ago in State of Emergency, that the federal government has lost its legitimacy across the board.
[01:01:10.594 --> 01:01:16.176]  On the civilian side, legislative, executive, judicial, on the military and the intelligence side.
[01:01:16.736 --> 01:01:20.998]  It is no longer a legitimate body of our national, of our republic.
[01:01:21.418 --> 01:01:23.159]  It has become a serious problem.
[01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:27.456]  To our Republic and the sustaining of the ability of the Republic to remain.
[01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:31.942]  So therefore the question becomes, does the Republic really have legitimacy?
[01:01:32.062 --> 01:01:32.843]  And the answer is no.
[01:01:33.516 --> 01:01:39.879]  The federal government has lost its legitimacy, and I think those who are requiring and asking for states' rights, I think, are right.
[01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:49.863]  I wrote about it in the state of emergency when I said state after state will fight over water resources, and that from now on our country has to be concerned about domestic issues.
[01:01:50.263 --> 01:01:57.766]  Taking care of our veterans, taking care of people's jobs, making sure that we grow domestically and not fund some military-industrial complex.
[01:01:58.426 --> 01:02:08.336]  General Eisenhower, one of our greatest generals, said we no longer need, it's dangerous, and at the same time warned the CIA that they would create a legacy of ashes.
[01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:12.137]  His words have come back to resonate 40, 50 years later.
[01:02:12.517 --> 01:02:21.705]  We have to decrease and eliminate most of our military across the board, just as George Marshall did when he fired six to 700 generals in one day.
[01:02:21.725 --> 01:02:27.470]  Eisenhower kept firing them until young men who were 26 and 27 were division commanders.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:29.431]  We don't need an army anymore.
[01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:31.313]  We have space warfare.
[01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.354]  We have cyber war.
[01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:33.295]  We don't need that.
[01:02:33.775 --> 01:02:39.425]  And the notion that we really need is the greatest national security problem we have is our national debt.
[01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:45.156]  And the greatest problem in our national debt is that we're not really developing our own economic strength.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.501]  And in doing that, we have to now get rid of those people who have committed the crimes against the state.
[01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:52.901]  Number one is Mueller.
[01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:58.883]  I think Mueller should be brought forth more than anybody else and investigated for what he has been investigating.
[01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:02.643]  Number two is the CIA, and they should be eliminated completely.
[01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:03.924]  Number three, the generals.
[01:03:04.324 --> 01:03:10.465]  About three to four hundred should be dismissed right away and taken down to the simplest core of special forces.
[01:03:10.945 --> 01:03:17.769]  Number four, I think everybody involved in this Benghazi attack, from Hillary Clinton, should be indicted for war crime.
[01:03:18.149 --> 01:03:20.190]  The President should be possibly impeached.
[01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:26.214]  Every one of the men in the White House, Donald and Brandon particularly, should be impeached and indicted.
[01:03:26.774 --> 01:03:31.517]  And as well as Clapper and the DNI, which is totally useless.
[01:03:32.137 --> 01:03:34.278]  And General Dempsey should be court-martialed.
[01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:35.618]  That's my opinion.
[01:03:35.738 --> 01:03:37.238]  I think that's what's going to happen.
[01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:42.219]  I think the American public is sick and tired of corruption, of excuses, of lies.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:48.421]  And throughout the world, we have been the only country that has lived through those lies and have been able to break through them.
[01:03:48.861 --> 01:03:50.501]  The American public is not stupid.
[01:03:51.082 --> 01:03:52.362]  They will not tolerate that.
[01:03:52.722 --> 01:03:56.943]  But the lies of 9-11 have come back of 2001 to recapitulate again the lies of Benghazi of 9-11.
[01:04:01.661 --> 01:04:04.563]  Congress needs to wake up, but it represents nothing.
[01:04:04.863 --> 01:04:07.084]  Congress is now a dead body.
[01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.585]  It has very little legitimacy.
[01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:10.666]  The White House has very little legitimacy.
[01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:30.758]  And so all we have is giant, organized crime syndicates battling for taxpayer money, and that's why they want to keep raising taxes to get more corporate welfare, and they plan on using the giant welfare hordes as the political muscle to vote the middle class's money directly into the bankers' hands, while the dumbed-down welfare queens drool, demanding more goodies.
[01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:37.079]  I think it goes back to the original statement I made ten years ago on your first show, which said we needed a revolution.
[01:04:37.339 --> 01:04:39.219]  A revolution doesn't have to be violent.
[01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:52.462]  It has to be one which takes down the totally corrupt White House, totally corrupt Congress, totally corrupt judicial system, totally corrupt FBI, Secret Service is totally corrupt.
[01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:54.082]  Time to restore the Republic!
[01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:56.622]  Dr. Pachinik, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:04:56.642 --> 01:04:58.363]  Thank you so much, dpachinik.com.
[01:04:58.743 --> 01:04:59.043]  Thank you.
[01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:00.603]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:07.858]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:05:08.118 --> 01:05:10.319]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:16.062]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[01:05:16.242 --> 01:05:19.484]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:05:19.644 --> 01:05:22.825]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.506]  There's no priming required.

[01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:29.529]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:31.930]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:33.431]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:36.412]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:05:36.712 --> 01:05:39.874]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:05:40.094 --> 01:05:41.875]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:05:41.995 --> 01:05:44.076]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.838]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:05:46.978 --> 01:05:48.279]  It's what my family uses.

[01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:27.497]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[01:08:05.386 --> 01:08:11.913]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:34.918 --> 01:08:41.681]  Welcome to another live hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:43.382 --> 01:08:45.463]  And I think you guessed it, I am Alex Jones.
[01:08:45.483 --> 01:08:51.946]  I know we've got a lot of new listeners tuning in every day as the broadcast continues to explode.
[01:08:52.907 --> 01:08:54.768]  Well, the bugle has sounded.
[01:08:54.848 --> 01:08:56.408]  The charge has begun.
[01:08:56.568 --> 01:08:59.570]  Obama is not facing re-election.
[01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:01.411]  He has the power of the executive order.
[01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:04.982]  He has shown he'll use it like no other president.
[01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:08.443]  And he, as a state senator and a U.S.
[01:09:08.463 --> 01:09:15.306]  senator, we did this in a report last week, read the quotes from the voter guides there in Illinois.
[01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:17.927]  He said he believes in the abolition of private ownership.
[01:09:17.967 --> 01:09:19.448]  He believes in a total ban of guns.
[01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.609]  You see Chicago, total ban.
[01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:24.430]  You see New York, total ban for the general public.
[01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:29.148]  If you're kind of the mafia-connected bigwigs that can get, you know, armed guards or whatever.
[01:09:29.168 --> 01:09:31.289]  You know, the mercenaries, they're always allowed to have their guns.
[01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:32.369]  The UN's above the law.
[01:09:32.389 --> 01:09:35.891]  They can rape and kill whoever they want, get diplomatic immunity in any city.
[01:09:36.611 --> 01:09:38.032]  So that's, that's what it's all about.
[01:09:38.092 --> 01:09:42.094]  The government massing weaponry against us private mercenaries, but we can't have anything.
[01:09:43.594 --> 01:09:46.396]  And Obama has said he wants the assault weapons ban back.
[01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:50.979]  And Dianne Feinstein, as you know, has said that means physical.
[01:09:51.039 --> 01:09:54.401]  She wants California-style, where you have to turn them in.
[01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:56.001]  She wants gun shows shut down.
[01:09:57.002 --> 01:10:02.704]  Again, I did a 20-minute special report last week titled, you know, Proof Obama is Coming for Your Guns.
[01:10:03.204 --> 01:10:12.068]  But I thought we should get Larry Pratt on for about 40 minutes or so, and then we'll go to your phone calls, those of you that are holding, and get into some of the economic news that I have not.
[01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:16.431]  Not gotten into yet in any detail that we need to cover.
[01:10:17.111 --> 01:10:24.395]  But I mean, this is just from last year and again this year, ATF to accept public comments prior to outlawing shotguns.
[01:10:24.995 --> 01:10:39.603]  And then you go, they have a link in the Greeley Gazette, it should have been National News, to the ATF and they said, oh, we're going to have a rulemaking saying we're going to ban most shotguns, 60 plus percent made in the last decade, that can take a clip.
[01:10:40.472 --> 01:10:41.874]  That can be converted to take a clip.
[01:10:41.894 --> 01:10:45.640]  Well, that's any gun that is shimmy, auto, or pump that you load in the bottom.
[01:10:45.901 --> 01:10:47.223]  That's pretty much all my shotguns.
[01:10:48.897 --> 01:10:50.318]  So it's not just law.
[01:10:50.919 --> 01:10:54.903]  They're suing gun manufacturers, Bloomberg, who also wants to tell you what you can eat and drink.
[01:10:55.623 --> 01:10:56.624]  These are control freaks.
[01:10:56.644 --> 01:11:04.352]  They want us to live like folks in Chicago and New York, with six, seven locks on our doors, the great people of New York and Chicago, not allowed to defend themselves.
[01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:06.073]  This is mafia government.
[01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:07.855]  We're on the air, by the way, in Chicago.
[01:11:08.215 --> 01:11:10.377]  We've had folks call in saying they wish they could have guns.
[01:11:10.758 --> 01:11:12.159]  Almost impossible to get one.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.121]  And they harass people statewide there.
[01:11:15.922 --> 01:11:18.624]  But those cities is where they really restrict it.
[01:11:19.224 --> 01:11:20.705]  California, highly restrictive.
[01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:24.508]  And if you look at a map of the world, most countries have banned guns outright.
[01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:26.390]  And they always follow the same pattern.
[01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.791]  So, the plunge is happening now.
[01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:32.094]  And I know Larry Platt doesn't like to be alarmist, but...
[01:11:34.481 --> 01:11:35.882]  What did Barry Goldwater say?
[01:11:36.862 --> 01:11:39.164]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[01:11:39.184 --> 01:11:41.926]  So I really want him, pun intended, to hit him with both barrels.
[01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:42.946]  Gunowners.org.
[01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:45.928]  He's the Executive Director of Gun Owners of America for over 30 years.
[01:11:45.988 --> 01:11:47.970]  Needs no introduction.
[01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:49.891]  And again, the NRA's gotten better.
[01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:57.794]  I remember talking to Larry 12 years ago and saying, you've got to go after the NRA for their 68 Gun Control Act support, for their current support.
[01:11:58.355 --> 01:12:03.418]  And he finally started going after them a few years ago when they were basically saying, oh, we can have some restriction.
[01:12:03.738 --> 01:12:08.481]  They've gotten a little better, but still, Gun Owners is the place to keep the NRA honest.
[01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:15.246]  So all I can say is go sign up, become a member, get their free email alerts, gunowners.org, because
[01:12:16.226 --> 01:12:21.688]  We would have our guns basically banned if it wasn't for Gun Owners of America and you supporting them and many others.
[01:12:21.728 --> 01:12:22.928]  And it's just a fact.
[01:12:23.409 --> 01:12:29.971]  Understand folks, we don't have a lot of allies, but the ones we've got are like big junkyard dogs in defense of the Republic.
[01:12:30.371 --> 01:12:31.971]  Larry, how bad is it?
[01:12:32.072 --> 01:12:36.813]  Because we know the former Chief of Staff at the White House said we're going to put you on a no-gun-by list.
[01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:37.994]  We know they're moving towards that.
[01:12:38.574 --> 01:12:40.514]  I mean, they are licking their chops right now.
[01:12:40.594 --> 01:12:41.935]  Obama said in the second debate,
[01:12:42.515 --> 01:12:45.517]  That he wants to ban not just semi-auto rifles, but handguns.
[01:12:45.937 --> 01:12:48.279]  So they're letting us know the UN has reconvened.
[01:12:49.019 --> 01:12:57.185]  They're letting us know that UN Gold of, quote, banning civilian ownership of firearms, saying they threaten the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:12:57.625 --> 01:13:01.968]  That's July 7th, 2001, UNIDIR.
[01:13:02.448 --> 01:13:03.409]  I mean, how bad is it?
[01:13:03.469 --> 01:13:10.294]  What is the state of our precious Second Amendment, the only country really in the world left, other than Switzerland, that doesn't have disarmed slaves?
[01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:18.257]  Well, Alex, first of all, thank you so much for letting me appear before your viewers and listeners.
[01:13:19.078 --> 01:13:24.722]  You have a tremendous audience and I'm very grateful every time I have a chance to visit with you.
[01:13:24.742 --> 01:13:29.825]  I don't think your concerns are misplaced.
[01:13:29.965 --> 01:13:37.450]  I think this president showed us during the time when he still had to face re-election that he didn't have any
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:46.914]  Basic problems, certainly no moral objection to ruling illegally and to ruling unconstitutionally.
[01:13:48.128 --> 01:13:58.217]  And his use of the executive order is something like perhaps ten times what George Bush's was, and his was quite a bit more than those before him.
[01:13:59.257 --> 01:14:08.245]  So we have seen government growing like a metastatic cancer here in Washington, and its enclaves
[01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:11.568]  All around the country and I suppose around the world.
[01:14:12.068 --> 01:14:19.333]  It's just stunning to me that we have re-elected a man who really doesn't give a rip about his oath of office.
[01:14:20.876 --> 01:14:24.438]  Whatever he understands by the Constitution isn't what the founders understood.
[01:14:24.978 --> 01:14:30.141]  And so I think we're in for, as you're indicating, a real tough time.
[01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:47.390]  I would have no surprise if the President were to have his Department of Justice issue an edict to gun stores, who are ultimately under them, through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is part of the Department of Justice, telling their dealers
[01:14:47.910 --> 01:15:05.129]  You'll lose your license after, oh, maybe 30 days from now, if you sell another handgun that has a caliber bigger than .380, or if you sell a long gun, rifle or shotgun, that accepts a high-capacity magazine.
[01:15:05.449 --> 01:15:08.713]  And as you indicated, that's probably most of your shotguns.
[01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:29.429]  and uh... any rifles you might have might also fit that same description uh... it's going to hit if he were to do something like that in a way that the dealers would have no choice because unconstitutionally they have to right now they have to have a permit a license from the federales in order to be able to
[01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.132]  Open a business and stay in business.
[01:15:32.692 --> 01:15:36.395]  And the day they pull that license from any dealer, he's out of business.
[01:15:36.435 --> 01:15:40.078]  He can no longer sell any of his guns to the general public.
[01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:40.839]  He's finished.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:47.225]  And so if your livelihood depends on that unconstitutional scrap of paper,
[01:15:47.805 --> 01:15:52.807]  Well, you're going to tend to do whatever you're told from Washington or else.
[01:15:53.367 --> 01:15:56.608]  And so I can see something like that happening.
[01:15:57.008 --> 01:16:03.510]  And by the way, it would probably make the UN so happy because in countries where they do let you have a gun,
[01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:09.917]  My wife's from Panama and their laws are rather similar to those of Latin America.
[01:16:10.397 --> 01:16:18.687]  If you can crawl over enough glass and you have enough connections and you finally get a permit, you'll be limited to a 380 and you won't be able to have
[01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:22.389]  Any long gun that accepts a high-capacity magazine.
[01:16:22.789 --> 01:16:28.733]  So that would make us so much more responsible in the eyes of the rest of the world.
[01:16:30.013 --> 01:16:46.263]  You know that that will be one of the arguments that, well, our good friends, if we're going to be a responsible citizen in the world community, these are the kinds of conditions that we will have to impose upon ourselves in order to be a good neighbor in the international community.
[01:16:46.943 --> 01:16:47.344]  Barf.
[01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:55.036]  I'm afraid that's what's coming down and there's two ways that I think we can try to deal with this.
[01:16:56.082 --> 01:17:04.889]  One is that there are a small number of representatives coming to the Congress, the likes of which there have never been in my memory.
[01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:16.638]  Maybe if I go back to John Ashbrook, somebody like that was a very outspoken conservative and died mysteriously in a Senate campaign years and years ago.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.464]  But for the recent past, we've had nobody like Steve Stockman, who just got elected from
[01:17:25.285 --> 01:17:32.890]  a district outside of Houston to the east and to the north and Jackie Walorski in the northwest corner of Indiana.
[01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:43.337]  These two have a history that tells me, and since I know them personally I'll just describe them, but I understand there may be a handful of others coming with the same
[01:17:44.438 --> 01:17:57.204]  Steel backbone that these two have when Stockman was in Congress for his one term with the class of 94 he introduced a bill to overturn the recently enacted Clinton gun ban
[01:17:58.317 --> 01:18:04.303]  And the Republicans were even more, if you will, gun-shy than they are now.
[01:18:05.084 --> 01:18:06.346]  This was a controversial issue.
[01:18:06.386 --> 01:18:07.106]  They didn't want to touch it.
[01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:07.827]  I get where you're going.
[01:18:07.907 --> 01:18:10.470]  It's time to get on the offense or we're cooked.
[01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:11.411]  It's over.
[01:18:11.471 --> 01:18:15.295]  We either realize we either gain ground or we're going to lose it all.
[01:18:15.615 --> 01:18:16.436]  This is a war.
[01:18:16.816 --> 01:18:18.357]  We cannot just keep having battles.
[01:18:18.637 --> 01:18:20.859]  We have to literally go dig these people out.
[01:18:21.139 --> 01:18:25.102]  We have to call them the authoritarian scum they are.
[01:18:25.382 --> 01:18:31.006]  Because listen, the gun culture, the reason they call us bitter clingers, is they know it's the core.
[01:18:31.327 --> 01:18:32.728]  It's what brings everybody together.
[01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:36.691]  Even liberals I know on social issues get now that they need guns.
[01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:38.552]  And we're gaining ground on this.
[01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:40.674]  So they're coming in to take it all.
[01:18:41.214 --> 01:18:43.536]  The final battle is starting to really unfold.
[01:18:44.266 --> 01:18:44.927]  I think so.
[01:18:45.427 --> 01:18:51.271]  I think we're going to see the fangs bared by this administration.
[01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:57.436]  Again, no more elections that he has to worry about and I don't think he worries about his party.
[01:18:57.456 --> 01:18:58.957]  I don't think he worries about anything.
[01:18:58.977 --> 01:19:00.838]  Finish your point about the people and bringing bills up.
[01:19:00.878 --> 01:19:01.659]  Is that what you were getting at?
[01:19:01.699 --> 01:19:02.900]  Is it time to go on the offense?
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.502]  It's time to go on the offense.
[01:19:04.582 --> 01:19:14.815]  It's time to reintroduce and to push all over again repealers that repeal a whole swath of unconstitutional federal gun laws.
[01:19:15.275 --> 01:19:18.960]  Stockman did it against his Republican leadership when he was in
[01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:22.123]  We were in a meeting in Dick Armey's office.
[01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:28.367]  He was the majority leader then, and he told us to our face, you're not going to get a vote on Stockman's bill.
[01:19:28.387 --> 01:19:30.429]  If you do, it'll be over my dead body.
[01:19:30.929 --> 01:19:33.852]  Well, Gingrich was a little politically moxier.
[01:19:34.112 --> 01:19:40.917]  We did get the vote because Gingrich didn't want gun owners of America messing over his guys in their districts over this issue.
[01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:42.488]  That's right.
[01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:46.331]  We've got to really just remove the rhinos, put real people in there.
[01:19:46.351 --> 01:19:49.733]  I want to come back and get into what I'm now seeing on the news.
[01:19:49.753 --> 01:19:51.515]  They're saying it's racist to own guns.
[01:19:51.535 --> 01:19:53.956]  Kind of like if you don't want government-run health care, you're racist.
[01:19:54.637 --> 01:19:56.898]  And Obama's now being called the conqueror.
[01:19:57.599 --> 01:20:01.281]  I mean, this is some really scary nomenclature we're hearing.
[01:20:01.321 --> 01:20:01.742]  Stay with us.
[01:20:02.362 --> 01:20:05.105]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:20:05.405 --> 01:20:10.249]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:20:10.429 --> 01:20:17.656]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:23.201]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:08.782]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:09.122 --> 01:21:10.964]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:21:11.244 --> 01:21:14.586]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:21:14.886 --> 01:21:19.149]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[01:21:19.369 --> 01:21:22.231]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:21:22.492 --> 01:21:26.815]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:21:27.095 --> 01:21:33.119]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:21:33.439 --> 01:21:35.100]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:41.983]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:21:52.049 --> 01:21:57.591]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to Faketv.com.

[01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:36.796]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.976 --> 01:22:42.680]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.202]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:46.422 --> 01:22:49.024]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:54.504 --> 01:23:55.925]  The choice is clear.
[01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:58.547]  Be unprepared or beprepared.com.
[01:23:58.847 --> 01:24:04.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's on.
[01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:05.611]  Obama said in the
[01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:17.905]  Second, debate that he doesn't want to just ban semi-automatic rifles.
[01:24:17.945 --> 01:24:20.587]  He wants to ban your handguns that are semi-automatic.
[01:24:20.627 --> 01:24:21.648]  That's most handguns.
[01:24:23.088 --> 01:24:30.053]  And they've got the UN Treaty coming up that once it's passed, the member nations 50% vote, 51% it becomes law here.
[01:24:30.553 --> 01:24:32.214]  They've got more Democrats in the Senate.
[01:24:34.182 --> 01:24:35.322]  And we're in deep trouble.
[01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:38.383]  I mean, we've never had the Second Amendment hanging by a thread.
[01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:47.646]  And they try to play this double game of going, we don't want your guns, you're stupid to go out and buy them, even though every gun I've bought over the last 20-something years has gone up in price.
[01:24:49.307 --> 01:24:49.927]  It's amazing.
[01:24:51.347 --> 01:25:07.620]  And they really can't stand the fact that we know they're liars, and we're voting with our dollars, and the fact that our gun culture, I just showed the Huffington Post article there in the last segment if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, but it says Obama's gotta do something about this growing gun culture.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.803]  They are hitting the panic button.
[01:25:10.823 --> 01:25:11.823]  Will you guys pull that back up?
[01:25:11.843 --> 01:25:12.964]  That was a great article you found.
[01:25:13.605 --> 01:25:15.146]  They are panicking.
[01:25:15.186 --> 01:25:16.687]  No, no, not that article about...
[01:25:18.628 --> 01:25:20.209]  General Petraeus put that one, yeah.
[01:25:20.609 --> 01:25:22.950]  Obama must take drastic action to end gun culture.
[01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:24.390]  To end our culture.
[01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.591]  See, the media has destroyed our culture.
[01:25:26.631 --> 01:25:27.812]  They've destroyed Christianity.
[01:25:27.832 --> 01:25:28.592]  They've destroyed everything.
[01:25:29.012 --> 01:25:30.873]  We don't have anything left, hardly, but guns.
[01:25:30.933 --> 01:25:33.634]  I hate to say that, but that's the one thing people still get.
[01:25:34.054 --> 01:25:34.794]  I'm not a slave.
[01:25:34.814 --> 01:25:36.154]  I have a right to defend myself.
[01:25:36.615 --> 01:25:38.415]  Places that take the guns have higher crime.
[01:25:38.755 --> 01:25:40.556]  Larry Pratt, I mean, is that an overstatement?
[01:25:40.916 --> 01:25:49.223]  That at so many levels, the strongest thing we've got at so many areas is the guns, and they know it, and they are launching a total assault on it.
[01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:50.825]  A, do you agree?
[01:25:50.905 --> 01:25:53.187]  B, what do we do to defeat them?
[01:25:53.227 --> 01:25:53.928]  I mean, I agree with you.
[01:25:54.168 --> 01:25:55.069]  Go on the offense.
[01:25:56.377 --> 01:26:03.343]  Well, in addition to going on the offense, and I think now we have some players who are willing to play offense.
[01:26:03.844 --> 01:26:04.724]  I mentioned two of them.
[01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:12.271]  Steve Stockman, a new representative in the House of Representatives here in Washington, and Jackie Walorski, also a new representative.
[01:26:12.892 --> 01:26:18.317]  They have a history of standing up to their party leaders, elected leaders.
[01:26:18.877 --> 01:26:25.081]  In Jackie Walorski's case, she bucked Governor Mitch Daniels, who is known as a fiscal conservative.
[01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:27.383]  Well, he wanted to raise taxes to balance the budget.
[01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:35.328]  And she bucked him and got the whole caucus eventually to go along with her, forcing him to make cuts instead of raising taxes.
[01:26:35.848 --> 01:26:43.090]  Now, in a way, that's at least as impressive as what Stockman did, because Stockman got his vote on the gun issue.
[01:26:43.691 --> 01:26:50.073]  And unlike the last time, if it goes over to the Senate, it's not going to be smothered by a Bob Dole.
[01:26:50.693 --> 01:26:58.876]  And Harry Reid has shown that when push comes to shove, he's a little reluctant to have an up or down vote on a gun issue.
[01:26:59.396 --> 01:27:05.258]  And so what I think might well happen is, we'll get something out of the House, it'll go over to the Senate,
[01:27:06.431 --> 01:27:33.874]  Reid won't want to bring it up, but the rules of the Senate are rather somewhat more available for getting things done, and as an amendment, on threat of a filibuster, I can see somebody like Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, somebody of that sort making sure that there's a fight to amend, say, a spending bill that the President has shown in the past he will sign even with pro-gun
[01:27:34.554 --> 01:27:35.715]  Amendments to it.
[01:27:36.256 --> 01:27:42.281]  And that way we could actually have the prospect of getting something done.
[01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.209]  No, we can break if you need to, that's fine.
[01:27:52.249 --> 01:28:03.000]  No, no, no, I was just going to say, shifting gears to another subject, because I mentioned it before the break, we are seeing, and I'm getting callers saying this, when I'm defending the Second Amendment, saying you're just a racist.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.741]  And I go, what does that mean?
[01:28:05.242 --> 01:28:09.526]  And they can't even say, and now I'm seeing MSNBC and people say, aha,
[01:28:10.527 --> 01:28:14.089]  The age of the white man's over, you're gonna have to turn your guns in.
[01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:24.314]  And I'm getting emails and seeing comments on YouTube, this is some new meme, like, like, like, oh, it's like a weird reverse racism or something.
[01:28:24.774 --> 01:28:27.296]  And the cover of Newsweek says, you're white, you're history.
[01:28:27.596 --> 01:28:31.338]  The Obama conquest, and he's in a Napoleon outfit with a sword.
[01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:33.519]  It's like some on the left now,
[01:28:34.179 --> 01:28:45.683]  Just are screaming for authoritarianism, but it's almost like Hitlerian, though, because it's mixed with a weird racial vitriol that I guess MSNBC's been able to sell.
[01:28:45.763 --> 01:28:46.824]  It's very bizarre.
[01:28:47.304 --> 01:28:56.607]  Yeah, they've learned that many conservatives, or at least many, quote, Republicans, are cowed by the playing of the race card.
[01:28:56.627 --> 01:29:00.209]  And I think what we need to do is to, if we're,
[01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:15.912]  I speak Spanish, I address Spanish audiences, I did a debate for an hour on CNN en Español, and the point has to be made that the fact that guns are readily available here is why America is different.
[01:29:16.292 --> 01:29:27.075]  It's the tangible expression of the American spirit that we the people are in charge, not the governments from which you fled to get here to America.
[01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:34.000]  I want to hear you break that down further when we come back, because it's fundamental that if they can get our guns, they believe they've won.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.382]  I mean, because then it's about living under the Socialists.
[01:29:36.402 --> 01:29:37.482]  They're going to take everything we got.
[01:29:37.502 --> 01:29:38.923]  I mean, this is slavery.
[01:29:39.744 --> 01:29:40.805]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:29:40.885 --> 01:29:41.966]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:29:42.046 --> 01:29:43.407]  Lenin, Mao.
[01:29:43.447 --> 01:29:46.149]  Mao Zedong said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:49.551]  The big government people don't like the fact we've got the guns.
[01:29:49.571 --> 01:29:50.172]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.482 --> 01:29:54.467]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.408 --> 01:29:58.092]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:09.105 --> 01:31:11.466]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:31:11.486 --> 01:31:11.866]  The U.S.
[01:31:11.946 --> 01:31:16.047]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:31:16.167 --> 01:31:18.748]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:31:19.128 --> 01:31:20.388]  They want that attack to come.

[01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:42.258]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:31:42.578 --> 01:31:45.139]  There is no preparedness without strategy.

[01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:09.499]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:16.891]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:33:15.377 --> 01:33:16.801]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:23.384]  Okay, Mark Faubourg, I tell you, he's been incredibly accurate predicting things.
[01:33:23.424 --> 01:33:25.425]  He's just prepared for massive market meltdown.
[01:33:25.445 --> 01:33:28.768]  We're going to get to that and then some of your phone calls when Larry Pratt leaves us.
[01:33:28.808 --> 01:33:30.669]  Larry, I've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:36.593]  I want you to be able to add any other points that you think are important for listeners and other assaults we're going to see.
[01:33:37.354 --> 01:33:39.095]  But they tell us they're coming after our guns.
[01:33:39.135 --> 01:33:41.777]  They go, you've got a Second Amendment, we just have a right to take them.
[01:33:42.318 --> 01:33:44.779]  But finishing up the point that you were trying to get to,
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.901]  Um, because they say, oh, I mean, it's racist that our guns are killing people in Mexico.
[01:33:51.402 --> 01:33:56.283]  Well, Mexico's banned guns, and most of the guys that have them, it's hand grenades and grenade launchers and machine guns.
[01:33:56.723 --> 01:33:58.123]  They're not getting those at gun stores.
[01:33:58.463 --> 01:34:01.444]  It's turned out the ATF was shipping them directly into Mexico.
[01:34:02.084 --> 01:34:07.666]  Fast and Furious goes a lot deeper, but finishing up with this weird racial vitriol
[01:34:09.242 --> 01:34:14.223]  Where Time Magazine says, you're white, you're history, and shows Obama as a general with a sword.
[01:34:14.243 --> 01:34:17.364]  I mean, that's pretty, they show him as a dictator.
[01:34:17.964 --> 01:34:21.025]  They also show him as Lincoln and say he may have to deal with the states.
[01:34:21.465 --> 01:34:30.008]  We have Texas now in less than 24 hours, what is it, 50-something thousand signatures now, it was 25,000 in hours, saying we want to secede.
[01:34:30.028 --> 01:34:34.169]  We need to just kick the globalists out of this country and just take our country back.
[01:34:35.249 --> 01:34:36.990]  I mean, where do you see Obama going?
[01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:40.872]  And, again, you were trying to finish your point about this whole racism angle.
[01:34:40.912 --> 01:34:42.953]  It's like, hey, I don't like lemon pie.
[01:34:43.033 --> 01:34:43.873]  Why are you racist?
[01:34:43.913 --> 01:34:45.974]  You know, it's like, hey, I don't like your food at this restaurant.
[01:34:45.994 --> 01:34:46.715]  What are you, racist?
[01:34:46.735 --> 01:34:50.657]  It's just this... And people call in like it's powerful.
[01:34:50.717 --> 01:34:56.339]  Like, they're going to say, why are you a racist when I'm talking about not wanting to shut down our coal power plants?
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.360]  And I go, what do you mean I'm racist?
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.261]  Well, you know you are.
[01:35:00.359 --> 01:35:01.320]  You don't like Obama.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:02.681]  And I go, yeah, I don't like him.
[01:35:02.701 --> 01:35:03.982]  He's a front man for the globalists.
[01:35:04.402 --> 01:35:06.283]  I mean, it's like a religion now.
[01:35:06.964 --> 01:35:07.945]  I mean, what can you say to this?
[01:35:07.965 --> 01:35:10.627]  You were getting cut off by the break talking about your CNN debate.
[01:35:11.533 --> 01:35:38.325]  Well, I think it's somewhat disappointing for the other side to realize that there are a number of us on the right who, I'm married to a Latin American woman, have been for almost 50 years, and I can debate them in Spanish, and so that kind of takes a little bit of the starch out of their shirt, I think, because it doesn't fit the stereotype that somebody that they just assume
[01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:43.313]  If you don't agree with me, as you were saying, Alex, it's one size fits all.
[01:35:43.333 --> 01:35:44.014]  Well, you're a racist.
[01:35:44.074 --> 01:35:47.802]  I mean, if you don't agree with me, down the line, everything I say, you're a racist.
[01:35:48.884 --> 01:35:49.385]  They don't.
[01:35:50.276 --> 01:35:54.440]  Increasingly, have the ability to debate their point.
[01:35:55.021 --> 01:36:04.149]  And when I did the CNN debate in Spanish, they felt... I guess they were comfortable with the strength in numbers, so it was three against one.
[01:36:05.631 --> 01:36:12.017]  But, you know, it's all the same argument, so I was really only debating one other, that argument that they all three were making.
[01:36:13.218 --> 01:36:13.939]  And they don't...
[01:36:15.495 --> 01:36:17.736]  I'm not sure they figured out how to get out of that pit.
[01:36:17.936 --> 01:36:32.843]  Now, so far, they were able to do a very effective job with Mitt Romney, because Mitt Romney, who doesn't share, say, a Reagan view of America's greatness, and he doesn't know how to articulate it, that's for sure, and he didn't!
[01:36:33.263 --> 01:36:36.165]  And so he let Obama get away with anything he wanted.
[01:36:36.745 --> 01:36:40.387]  And, in fact, as you say, they came up with the race card
[01:36:41.514 --> 01:36:45.055]  In the Fast and Furious scandal, wait, wait, wait, excuse me?
[01:36:45.756 --> 01:36:53.478]  Those are Mexicans that are dying, almost none of whom trace back to Spain through my wife's lineage.
[01:36:53.818 --> 01:37:08.824]  These are people who are brown, who are typical Latin Americans, and I thought it was kind of racist to kill some 400-plus and counting with guns that our government sent down there for that purpose!
[01:37:09.304 --> 01:37:10.785]  I mean, why isn't that racist?
[01:37:11.046 --> 01:37:19.593]  Sure, I mean, you're right, but I mean, it's literally, like you said, you go, hey, I don't want socialism, I don't want to lose our freedoms, and they just call in and go, you're a racist.
[01:37:20.274 --> 01:37:28.881]  And then they wait like you're about to fall over, and I guess, and they repeat talking points of MSNBC and Chris Matthews and
[01:37:29.862 --> 01:37:34.927]  And Rachel Maddow and all of them, I mean, they get up there and they say, if you don't like health care, it's because you're racist.
[01:37:35.748 --> 01:37:36.829]  No, I don't.
[01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:39.032]  I know government's going to ruin health care.
[01:37:39.132 --> 01:37:40.593]  And look, the prices are already going up.
[01:37:40.954 --> 01:37:42.315]  The economy is shutting down.
[01:37:42.435 --> 01:37:42.635]  I mean.
[01:37:43.619 --> 01:37:44.380]  Socialism?
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:59.654]  I had a guy call in, you know, who said he was a socialist, and when I said, well I don't like socialism, he's endorsed communism before, he's named John from Ohio, he's called many times, he's a white guy, and when I said, look, socialism doesn't work, he goes, well that's a typical racist statement.
[01:38:00.373 --> 01:38:03.415]  And I'm like, I mean, the Russians are white.
[01:38:03.535 --> 01:38:04.536]  It didn't work over there.
[01:38:04.556 --> 01:38:07.218]  I mean, you know, there's hardly any black people over there.
[01:38:07.238 --> 01:38:08.959]  Maybe, you know, one out of a thousand.
[01:38:09.279 --> 01:38:10.660]  What is that now racist too?
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:16.525]  I mean, it's like, I mean, if I say I like lemon pie over cheesecake, they go, that's racist.
[01:38:16.605 --> 01:38:16.785]  I mean,
[01:38:17.065 --> 01:38:24.909]  It's like if I say I like blue skies instead of, you know, uh, red skies, it's, I mean, it's like if I haven't, all they say is that.
[01:38:24.929 --> 01:38:27.791]  It's like a weird cult of people just like parrots.
[01:38:27.951 --> 01:38:29.552]  Racism, racism, right?
[01:38:29.592 --> 01:38:30.813]  It's really bizarre.
[01:38:31.193 --> 01:38:32.694]  Racism, racism, racism.
[01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:42.142]  Some of the folks that have been produced by the public schools, the government schools, are probably okay with that comeback.
[01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:42.862]  That's racist.
[01:38:43.363 --> 01:38:47.467]  But frankly, a lot of people in this country still can think.
[01:38:48.167 --> 01:38:53.392]  And if that's the way they want to conduct a debate in front of the American people,
[01:38:54.813 --> 01:38:55.253]  Bring it on.
[01:38:55.814 --> 01:39:02.517]  I think it's time we have that debate and let the whole country see just how inadequate their arguments are.
[01:39:02.537 --> 01:39:12.982]  But why would Newsweek come out and have David Fromm, who's attacked me seven ways this Sunday, come out and say, if you're white, you're history?
[01:39:13.062 --> 01:39:15.983]  I mean, that isn't... and then I see that as a meme online.
[01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:21.406]  It's like trying to... I guess they want... the left really wants to try to have a race war in the hopper.
[01:39:22.728 --> 01:39:27.072]  Well, golly, you're going to have to be attacked by somebody of more substance than Newsweek.
[01:39:27.312 --> 01:39:29.594]  They're no longer publishing in paper.
[01:39:29.854 --> 01:39:31.175]  They're only online.
[01:39:32.096 --> 01:39:35.679]  The American people are not buying that stuff.
[01:39:36.159 --> 01:39:43.085]  And if that little kept house conservative, Mr. Fromm, is happy associating with Newsweek, bless his heart.
[01:39:43.365 --> 01:39:44.726]  More power to him.
[01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:48.364]  You're right, he is just a piece of work.
[01:39:50.207 --> 01:39:52.210]  What do you think this election really signified?
[01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:54.573]  I mean, I saw a lot of fraud against Romney.
[01:39:54.613 --> 01:39:55.714]  I just call it like I see it.
[01:39:57.096 --> 01:40:01.042]  Some states didn't even count that day's votes and just said that Obama was the winner.
[01:40:02.423 --> 01:40:08.066]  I see them saying conservatives and libertarians had better become socialist if you ever want to win the Democrats.
[01:40:08.106 --> 01:40:11.728]  Well, I mean, if you became Stalin, they would become Lenin.
[01:40:11.768 --> 01:40:13.889]  If you became Lenin, they would become Marx.
[01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:19.412]  There's no way to ever become them to win because you've already become them.
[01:40:19.712 --> 01:40:22.453]  You've got to go out and promote real constitutionalism.
[01:40:23.194 --> 01:40:28.396]  We saw 12 million to 15 million Ron Paul people go out and not vote this time because of the way they were treated.
[01:40:28.416 --> 01:40:30.998]  And in a way, some say let it get worse.
[01:40:31.858 --> 01:40:33.522]  That's what will cause real change.
[01:40:33.562 --> 01:40:35.726]  I mean, is there a way to make lemons out of this lemonade?
[01:40:37.113 --> 01:40:41.994]  Well, I prefer to make lemons that I purchased rather than they were shoved down my throat.
[01:40:42.214 --> 01:40:42.914]  Sure.
[01:40:43.255 --> 01:40:44.635]  I'll do what I have to do.
[01:40:45.275 --> 01:41:01.539]  And so in addition to going on the offense in Congress, which I think now we might be able to do, we also need to keep in mind, and you and I have talked about this before, there is in most of our states the very powerful institution of the County Sheriff.
[01:41:01.899 --> 01:41:04.400]  In fact, one of the things I'd urge people to buy at our
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:11.823]  site at GunOwners.org in the media section where we have the bookstore, or what others say, you'll find the bookstore.
[01:41:12.924 --> 01:41:15.305]  It's called The County Sheriff by Richard Mack.
[01:41:15.405 --> 01:41:16.665]  You've probably interviewed him.
[01:41:16.786 --> 01:41:17.466]  Excellent book.
[01:41:17.506 --> 01:41:18.366]  We carry it as well.
[01:41:18.426 --> 01:41:23.549]  People should go to GunOwners.org and buy that book and give it to your sheriff and give it to all the sheriff candidates.
[01:41:24.389 --> 01:41:25.890]  Yes.
[01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:27.851]  Read it first so you're sure you know what's in it.
[01:41:28.171 --> 01:41:39.836]  But it's the history and the constitutional doctrine of the sheriff is the top cop because he's the only cop that has an immediate delegation of authority via election from we the people.
[01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:41.316]  By we the people.
[01:41:41.656 --> 01:41:52.541]  And so it is very important that we increase the number of these constitutional sheriffs throughout the land who are willing and able to tell the feds
[01:41:53.161 --> 01:41:54.282]  Not in my county.
[01:41:54.463 --> 01:42:04.392]  If what you're trying to do is not in Article 1, Section 8 of our federal constitution, and there's a couple other things the constitution tells them to do as well, then you're not going to do it here in this county.
[01:42:04.412 --> 01:42:07.075]  And the sheriff gets their authority from the state constitutions.
[01:42:07.696 --> 01:42:11.420]  Expanding on that, what do you make of nullification?
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:13.562]  I think that's something we're going to really see explode now.
[01:42:15.235 --> 01:42:27.246]  The sheriff is the guy who can nullify a state legislature, can nullify an acting legislation, and some states have done it, saying there's not going to be any exchange for Obamacare in our state.
[01:42:28.307 --> 01:42:31.690]  They are just flat out telling the feds, take a hike.
[01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:35.273]  That's what the federal system was designed to do.
[01:42:35.873 --> 01:42:42.819]  And now with 25 states, I think is the latest count, petitioning the White House for secession.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:52.547]  And it's a rather more serious matter than any of the other states when Texas does that because Texas came into the union with the proviso explicitly.
[01:42:53.268 --> 01:42:58.391]  Proviso, that it can also say adios, and it can be on its way.
[01:42:58.411 --> 01:43:02.634]  And that's why it's called the Lone Star State, because it has that proviso built in.
[01:43:02.654 --> 01:43:04.795]  Go ahead.
[01:43:05.536 --> 01:43:08.058]  So I think that's a very serious threat.
[01:43:08.598 --> 01:43:14.562]  Texas is one of the few healthy economies among the states of this country.
[01:43:15.382 --> 01:43:16.343]  It's robust.
[01:43:16.663 --> 01:43:18.985]  It has a conservative political culture.
[01:43:19.785 --> 01:43:25.107]  And frankly, I think there could be a majority of Texans that say, you know, why not?
[01:43:25.147 --> 01:43:27.008]  We've got our own seacoast.
[01:43:27.048 --> 01:43:32.991]  They can't really boycott our airports because we have too many hubs that are central for the airlines.
[01:43:33.471 --> 01:43:35.792]  We're just too important for them to ignore.
[01:43:37.893 --> 01:43:40.535]  Do they really think they're going to invade Texas and take it over?
[01:43:41.676 --> 01:43:45.698]  You know, they tried that once and they got away with it that one time.
[01:43:45.798 --> 01:43:47.259]  I don't think they'd get away with it this time.
[01:43:47.339 --> 01:43:52.122]  I don't think the military would, most of them, would say, that's not a constitutional order.
[01:43:52.463 --> 01:43:53.043]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:43:53.283 --> 01:44:00.828]  Well, the Texas Legislature last year said you're not going to grope us anymore because all of the House reps been flying into Austin had been getting groped.
[01:44:01.188 --> 01:44:02.409]  Unanimous House vote.
[01:44:02.729 --> 01:44:06.471]  Dewhurst killed it in the Senate, so he lost his national Senate run.
[01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:10.734]  Cruz says he's going to support the Second Amendment, a Ron Paul type guy.
[01:44:10.774 --> 01:44:12.375]  We'll see if that's really the case.
[01:44:13.776 --> 01:44:18.579]  But expanding on all of this, they threaten a federal blockade with aircraft.
[01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:21.240]  I say, throw me in that briar patch.
[01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.302]  Let's get this confrontation going.
[01:44:23.322 --> 01:44:24.743]  Let's show what crooks you are.
[01:44:25.939 --> 01:44:26.159]  Right.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:38.034]  I think that blockade would hurt the remaining states more than it would hurt Texas, and it could well precipitate a sympathetic joining of Texas' actions.
[01:44:38.054 --> 01:44:38.995]  You know what's going to happen.
[01:44:39.015 --> 01:44:45.283]  We need Texas to lead out of this new order takeover, and then we can reconstitute the republic, because there's no doubt, Larry.
[01:44:45.603 --> 01:44:47.604]  We've got a globalist takeover in Washington.
[01:44:47.624 --> 01:44:49.065]  They think they've conquered this country.
[01:44:49.365 --> 01:44:52.247]  They brag on the news that these foreign banks have taken us over.
[01:44:52.587 --> 01:44:58.470]  They're the ones that want us disarmed so that they can create socialism to suck our money offshore to themselves.
[01:44:58.990 --> 01:45:03.773]  And they want to use a giant gaggle of illegals and welfare queens as their army.
[01:45:04.173 --> 01:45:06.054]  And I just, you know, it's time to call them on it.
[01:45:06.474 --> 01:45:07.595]  It's time to get in their face.
[01:45:09.066 --> 01:45:11.687]  Texas could effectively seal its own border.
[01:45:12.007 --> 01:45:21.611]  That would be an extremely positive first step, whether or not they ultimately secede, to simply say, we're being invaded.
[01:45:22.331 --> 01:45:25.833]  United States, you're supposed to protect us from invasion.
[01:45:26.113 --> 01:45:26.613]  You're not.
[01:45:27.293 --> 01:45:30.555]  We're going to take that over because we didn't give that power away.
[01:45:30.895 --> 01:45:33.676]  We just said that was something the federal government should do.
[01:45:33.956 --> 01:45:36.077]  But if you're not going to do it, we're going to do it.
[01:45:36.477 --> 01:45:40.961]  And what are the Feds going to do, invade Texas in order to not close the border?
[01:45:41.421 --> 01:45:45.664]  I think at some point the American people are going to say, what?
[01:45:45.684 --> 01:45:57.013]  The biggest problem I saw with Romney is he, as a liberal, would not join issues and he would not call Obama the socialist that he is, he would not specifically
[01:45:57.954 --> 01:46:13.145]  ...draw attention to the many socialist programs that Obama has been implementing and advocating, and he would not address the country in terms of the greatness of America, what it has been and what it can be again.
[01:46:13.486 --> 01:46:15.167]  He didn't spell any of that out.
[01:46:15.347 --> 01:46:16.508]  Sure, because he couldn't.
[01:46:16.528 --> 01:46:21.912]  He agreed with Obama on so much, and instead of, again, people going and joining the Globalist,
[01:46:22.532 --> 01:46:27.178]  This is a real shot across the bow of the Republicans that no more games.
[01:46:27.218 --> 01:46:29.201]  They're not co-opting the Liberty Movement.
[01:46:29.541 --> 01:46:30.162]  It's over.
[01:46:30.583 --> 01:46:37.112]  They're either going to disappear and let the Democrats take over, and a bunch of states are going to secede, or the power structure is going to get it.
[01:46:37.904 --> 01:46:38.064]  Right.
[01:46:38.344 --> 01:47:00.272]  They're either going to have to act like Republicans talk, in other words, they're going to have to walk the talk, or I agree with you, there will be, at first, I think we might see next election an increase in what we saw this time, the establishment continue to lose in contests that are brought by conservatives.
[01:47:01.092 --> 01:47:04.573]  The one in your Texas Senate race was a great example.
[01:47:04.873 --> 01:47:08.839]  of an outsider challenging the establishment Dewhurst.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.685]  And Dewhurst showed what the establishment was like.
[01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:16.611]  He's a facilitator of all that is wrong in Texas.
[01:47:17.312 --> 01:47:19.055]  He makes it happen or keeps
[01:47:20.006 --> 01:47:37.057]  reform from happening as lieutenant governor there in texas exactly it the terrible record and cruz calling on it showed how you should run a campaign and when people hear that there is a distinction being drawn by somebody who really believes in freedom
[01:47:37.597 --> 01:47:40.319]  The freedom fighter is often going to win.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.480]  Well said.
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:45.563]  There's no doubt Ron Paul would have beaten Obama, but the Republicans had to throw him out of there.
[01:47:46.464 --> 01:47:47.665]  And so now look what they've gotten.
[01:47:47.685 --> 01:47:50.187]  Larry Pratt, by the way, we were at GunOwners.org.
[01:47:50.207 --> 01:47:51.328]  I've never seen this happen before.
[01:47:51.368 --> 01:47:52.509]  We crashed your site, buddy.
[01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:57.993]  Gee, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:47:58.033 --> 01:47:59.294]  We'll have it back up shortly.
[01:47:59.775 --> 01:48:02.777]  Everybody should go there and sign up for the free email alerts.
[01:48:02.817 --> 01:48:03.938]  Thank you so much, Larry Pratt.
[01:48:04.639 --> 01:48:05.319]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:48:05.359 --> 01:48:05.619]  Thanks.
[01:48:05.739 --> 01:48:06.239]  There he goes.
[01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:08.060]  He's going off to another interview in 15 minutes.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.900]  All right, I said I'd take some phone calls.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.580]  I've got the economic news I need to hit.
[01:48:12.561 --> 01:48:14.921]  Let's just, is Trent ready in Illinois?
[01:48:15.421 --> 01:48:16.961]  Because we'll go to a call right now.
[01:48:17.422 --> 01:48:23.263]  All I can say is there's a lot of breaking news at Infowars.com right now.
[01:48:23.703 --> 01:48:28.944]  FEMA is now telling people in New York and New Jersey not to bring food to people, though only they're allowed to do it.
[01:48:30.305 --> 01:48:33.827]  Stocks tumble as congressman predicts economic riots in America.
[01:48:35.168 --> 01:48:38.011]  U.S.-Canada integrated cybersecurity agenda.
[01:48:38.031 --> 01:48:40.373]  Why Obama wants your guns and the rest of your freedoms.
[01:48:40.733 --> 01:48:42.735]  What an incredibly important raft of articles.
[01:48:43.175 --> 01:48:48.279]  Adon Salazar, citizens from 34 states petition White House to secede from the U.S.
[01:48:48.319 --> 01:48:49.280]  Another big article there.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:53.564]  San Diego residents face six years in prison for washing their own cars.
[01:48:54.224 --> 01:48:58.473]  It actually says at the local news, and they're saying, yes, you wash your car, we're gonna arrest you.
[01:48:58.493 --> 01:48:59.394]  If your dog poops, $100,000 fine.
[01:49:01.721 --> 01:49:02.421]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:49:31.812 --> 01:49:37.916]  I want to start off by saying I do not support Obama, and I do not support the actions that he is undergoing with the country at the moment.
[01:49:38.617 --> 01:49:44.420]  But my real question I want to get your take on, when are we going to see Denver Airport come into play?
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:53.186]  From the research that I've done, is that it's going to be the base for the globalist elite to survive while
[01:49:53.906 --> 01:49:55.487]  They're just destroying everything.
[01:49:55.507 --> 01:49:59.689]  Yeah, I mean, it's official that Colorado is the designated secondary capital.
[01:49:59.769 --> 01:50:02.210]  It's got a bunch of underground bases in Colorado Springs.
[01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:03.671]  They're at NORAD and all over Denver.
[01:50:03.711 --> 01:50:06.052]  There's a bunch of underground stuff there at Denver.
[01:50:06.493 --> 01:50:09.834]  That's just the globalists digging in in case they have a nuclear war with China or Russia.
[01:50:10.395 --> 01:50:12.456]  And they have the COG government operating there.
[01:50:12.676 --> 01:50:13.996]  The Congress is all vestigial.
[01:50:14.737 --> 01:50:17.378]  Unless Congress stands up and retakes its power.
[01:50:18.699 --> 01:50:22.421]  And so, yeah, that's my take on that on the Denver airport, sir.
[01:50:24.386 --> 01:50:28.368]  So you think that we're going to be seeing a lot more action with it coming here shortly?
[01:50:29.069 --> 01:50:29.369]  No.
[01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:33.331]  We already have a NORTHCOM military over the U.S.
[01:50:34.272 --> 01:50:35.873]  We already have Space Command based there.
[01:50:36.173 --> 01:50:38.014]  The real government is based there.
[01:50:38.495 --> 01:50:43.678]  That's why there's more underground bunkers and underground railways and missile bases you can shake a stick at.
[01:50:44.258 --> 01:50:45.599]  That's the head of NORTHCOM.
[01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:48.141]  That's the head of the military industrial complex.
[01:50:48.201 --> 01:50:49.382]  It's run by foreign banks.
[01:50:49.842 --> 01:50:50.963]  That's the real capital.
[01:50:51.563 --> 01:50:53.845]  The whorehouse on the Potomac, D.C.
[01:50:54.426 --> 01:50:59.990]  is just the crime syndicate minions that are there as a facade of a scheduled ceremonial crust.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.362]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:51:05.622 --> 01:51:07.304]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[01:51:07.584 --> 01:51:10.886]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[01:51:11.207 --> 01:51:13.248]  Solar power generators are now available.
[01:51:13.388 --> 01:51:16.791]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:51:16.991 --> 01:51:22.775]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:51:23.035 --> 01:51:26.398]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:51:26.718 --> 01:51:31.301]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:37.104]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:51:37.364 --> 01:51:38.405]  And here's the best news.
[01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:41.567]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[01:51:41.767 --> 01:51:45.569]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:48.251]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators,
[01:51:48.411 --> 01:51:48.832]  We're good to go.
[01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:08.372]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:52:08.972 --> 01:52:10.092]  That's closer than you think.
[01:52:10.813 --> 01:52:16.635]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:52:16.995 --> 01:52:24.918]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:31.260]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:33.021]  But here's some good news.
[01:52:33.401 --> 01:52:42.226]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:52:42.887 --> 01:52:46.729]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google.
[01:52:47.169 --> 01:52:51.672]  And the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:52:52.152 --> 01:52:56.195]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:52:56.335 --> 01:52:57.856]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:05.094]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:53:05.754 --> 01:53:07.896]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:53:08.797 --> 01:53:17.145]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:53:17.765 --> 01:53:22.690]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:53:23.311 --> 01:53:34.281]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:53:34.681 --> 01:53:41.688]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:53:42.348 --> 01:53:46.630]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:53:46.650 --> 01:53:49.832]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:53:50.252 --> 01:53:53.174]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:53:53.194 --> 01:53:57.216]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:53:57.516 --> 01:53:58.536]  Protect your immune system.
[01:53:58.796 --> 01:53:59.857]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:53:59.877 --> 01:54:07.821]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:54:07.901 --> 01:54:11.143]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[01:54:16.049 --> 01:54:17.291]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[01:54:27.715 --> 01:54:29.956]  And the man, the foreign bankers, the banksters, they don't like that.
[01:54:29.976 --> 01:54:33.437]  And the worst part is they know that we're all independent people.
[01:54:51.582 --> 01:54:56.086]  On average, don't buy the establishment's bull.
[01:54:56.186 --> 01:55:02.311]  And that's why they're doing everything they can to shut down our rural communities and to kill the gun culture.
[01:55:04.733 --> 01:55:06.354]  And what the establishment wants...
[01:55:14.617 --> 01:55:18.718]  Is to get you to turn your guns in.
[01:55:19.718 --> 01:55:22.379]  And then they can really drop the hammer on us.
[01:55:22.499 --> 01:55:27.840]  Because they can't starve us out, and they can't make us run.
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.901]  And that's what the system wants to get rid of.
[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:46.393]  What you need to do, no matter what race, color, creed, religion you are, is get self-sufficient.
[01:55:47.514 --> 01:55:51.516]  And realize that, hey, we can all kill each other later if you want, if that's what you want to do.
[01:55:52.517 --> 01:55:55.138]  But we need to understand the globalists are taking over our world.
[01:55:55.178 --> 01:56:01.442]  It's a scientific takeover, and it's anti-human, it's anti-God, and we better come together against the new world order.
[01:56:02.102 --> 01:56:08.606]  You know in your gut it's true, you know intellectually it's true, and it's time for moron mainline conservatives to stop thinking they're part of the elite.
[01:56:08.646 --> 01:56:09.727]  It's time for liberals to start
[01:56:10.495 --> 01:56:12.160]  Waking up and not thinking they're part of the elite.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.767]  It's time to realize we're all in deep trouble and humble ourselves.
[01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:17.596]  Look at some of these headlines.
[01:56:17.696 --> 01:56:20.677]  Syrian opposition says West has promised military aid.
[01:56:21.897 --> 01:56:25.238]  More arms to Al-Qaeda.
[01:56:25.258 --> 01:56:28.318]  6,125 proposed regulations and notifications posted in the last 90 days.
[01:56:28.739 --> 01:56:31.479]  The Feds post it and let you comment and ram it forward.
[01:56:31.819 --> 01:56:37.480]  Like the Federal Reserve under Frank Dodd has its new enforcers over any business where they can just take things over.
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:40.321]  Private Federal Reserve is becoming a government agency openly.
[01:56:40.681 --> 01:56:42.962]  So in a way you can say it's government but unaccountable.
[01:56:43.222 --> 01:56:44.782]  A private government of pirates.
[01:56:46.135 --> 01:56:47.896]  It's now up to 34 states petitioning.
[01:56:47.916 --> 01:56:49.696]  It was just a few dozen last night.
[01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.217]  An additional 10 or so now.
[01:56:51.237 --> 01:56:52.317]  It's a seed.
[01:56:52.357 --> 01:56:54.498]  Again, Adon Salazar, Infowars.com.
[01:56:55.898 --> 01:56:59.119]  Mark Favre, prepare for massive market meltdown.
[01:56:59.159 --> 01:57:00.380]  And that's out of CNBC.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.320]  But get ready here.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.841]  They've had members of Congress come out and say things are going to implode.
[01:57:04.881 --> 01:57:06.342]  Stocks tumble, as Congressman predicts.
[01:57:06.382 --> 01:57:07.922]  Economic riots in America.
[01:57:07.962 --> 01:57:09.203]  Louisiana Republican warns.
[01:57:09.243 --> 01:57:11.223]  Day of reckoning rapidly approaching.
[01:57:11.504 --> 01:57:15.225]  And the government will play the part of the savior and say, give me VAT.
[01:57:17.386 --> 01:57:22.908]  Give me carbon tax, and that's in the news, and that new money will keep the welfare checks going.
[01:57:23.388 --> 01:57:30.311]  Now, it won't matter that 90% of that money will go to foreign banks, as long as they say, we're gonna give it to the poor people!
[01:57:30.892 --> 01:57:36.754]  And they'll still get their check in devalued dollars and won't be able to buy as much, but that'll be okay.
[01:57:37.534 --> 01:57:43.177]  And I'll get to hear all day how it's evil and how I want the poor to starve if I don't want this.
[01:57:43.497 --> 01:57:45.337]  There's a reason the mega-rich want this.
[01:57:45.398 --> 01:57:46.278]  It's called a takeover.
[01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:48.230]  Here's one.
[01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:56.813]  Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System agencies issued statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions and borrowers affected by Hurricane Sandy.
[01:57:57.093 --> 01:57:58.693]  The Federal Reserve now regulates.
[01:57:59.174 --> 01:58:02.034]  Can the Federal Reserve help prevent a second recession?
[01:58:02.555 --> 01:58:04.135]  Oh, they're saving us.
[01:58:04.795 --> 01:58:09.097]  Is the Federal Reserve using money laundering techniques to cleanse banks' balance sheets?
[01:58:09.137 --> 01:58:09.617]  Well, of course.
[01:58:09.657 --> 01:58:11.377]  It's a narcotics trafficking operation.
[01:58:11.737 --> 01:58:12.358]  That's Forbes.
[01:58:13.858 --> 01:58:17.060]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:58:18.001 --> 01:58:19.261]  Very important articles.
[01:58:19.301 --> 01:58:22.003]  And the most important of the day just came out by Paul Watson.
[01:58:22.023 --> 01:58:22.903]  I want it red-linked.
[01:58:23.544 --> 01:58:26.646]  Why Obama Wants Your Guns and the Rest of Your Freedoms.
[01:58:27.226 --> 01:58:29.627]  Second Amendment in the crosshairs.
[01:58:29.647 --> 01:58:30.568]  They're coming!
[01:58:31.168 --> 01:58:34.330]  And we've got them from every hill and mountain like Paul Revere announced.

[02:00:12.887 --> 02:00:13.827]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.427 --> 02:00:18.028]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.628 --> 02:00:22.709]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.593 --> 02:00:41.516]  It is Friday, the ninth day of November 2012.
[02:00:42.196 --> 02:00:47.821]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[02:00:47.901 --> 02:00:58.230]  Today we have several special reports that are going to premiere here on the radio in the third hour today, including the proof that, yes, the U.N.
[02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:04.636]  Treaty does restrict your Second Amendment, and proof that Obama is coming after your guys.
[02:01:05.396 --> 02:01:05.936]  It's on.
[02:01:06.596 --> 02:01:07.877]  They're moving on every front.
[02:01:07.897 --> 02:01:10.117]  They're going to shut down the industry.
[02:01:10.157 --> 02:01:11.437]  They're going to raise the taxes.
[02:01:11.477 --> 02:01:13.138]  They're going to put in the carbon taxes.
[02:01:14.558 --> 02:01:15.798]  All of it designed.
[02:01:16.159 --> 02:01:19.579]  You see all these businesses finally shutting down now that Obama's been re-elected.
[02:01:20.159 --> 02:01:22.540]  Tens of thousands being laid off just in the first day.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:30.242]  It's because a lot of companies operate on such small profit margins that they cannot compete
[02:01:31.242 --> 02:01:35.405]  Uh, with the government health care system, uh, also increasing the price of health care.
[02:01:35.445 --> 02:01:46.012]  They can barely hang on against China, against India, against Mexico, who don't have any health care, any workers comp, make you work 18 hours a day, suicide nets at the Apple factories.
[02:01:46.552 --> 02:01:48.894]  And so it's like, okay, we're shutting down.
[02:01:48.914 --> 02:01:49.875]  We're closing our doors.
[02:01:50.675 --> 02:01:51.196]  We're gone.
[02:01:51.256 --> 02:01:52.417]  We're not going to hire anybody.
[02:01:52.797 --> 02:01:54.760]  Or we're going to lay off, you know, half our workforce.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:02.168]  Or all the big corporations are saying, you know what, you get 20 hours a week down instead of 40 so you don't get your insurance.
[02:02:02.868 --> 02:02:04.090]  And that's great.
[02:02:04.210 --> 02:02:05.111]  That's the plan.
[02:02:05.691 --> 02:02:10.997]  Now you'll go from 25 million on food stamps when Obama got in to right at 50 million.
[02:02:11.277 --> 02:02:11.758]  It'll go to 100 mil.
[02:02:13.587 --> 02:02:18.309]  And even more will shut down until we have the gas shortages, the food shortages.
[02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:20.110]  This is a plan.
[02:02:20.911 --> 02:02:22.131]  They did this in China.
[02:02:22.171 --> 02:02:23.252]  They did this in Russia.
[02:02:23.292 --> 02:02:24.413]  They did this in Cuba.
[02:02:24.833 --> 02:02:25.873]  They did this everywhere.
[02:02:25.913 --> 02:02:27.134]  They've been doing it in Venezuela.
[02:02:27.854 --> 02:02:28.715]  And this is it.
[02:02:29.838 --> 02:02:42.089]  Until those of us that even know how to work are in forced labor camps producing for the welfare queens, walking around with their submachine guns, beating us up with a heap of shovels.
[02:02:42.609 --> 02:02:44.051]  Now, it'll never get to that point.
[02:02:44.411 --> 02:02:51.437]  It got to that point in North Korea, got to that point to a great extent in Cuba, got to that point in the Soviet Union, got that point in China.
[02:02:51.718 --> 02:02:53.940]  China got smart and made a deal with the globalists who put them in
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:03:03.586]  Place to begin with in 49 to be just a slave system or a fascist system calling itself communist but allowing some free enterprise.
[02:03:04.226 --> 02:03:05.007]  But they're not going to do that.
[02:03:05.027 --> 02:03:10.591]  They're going to strangle the goose with the golden eggs because they hate America so much.
[02:03:11.131 --> 02:03:12.772]  And it's about total domination.
[02:03:13.373 --> 02:03:17.515]  And so there will be plenty of cream in the globalist bunkers.
[02:03:18.476 --> 02:03:22.178]  The armored redoubts and the new status will be black uniforms.
[02:03:22.499 --> 02:03:24.120]  Won't matter if you live in a little hovel and
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.081]  You know, don't get a lot of food either.
[02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:32.446]  At least you're going to get to strut around under the new austerity and check some papers and break some jaws, alright?
[02:03:32.586 --> 02:03:37.029]  And run some checkpoints and see the once-great citizens pull up to them and be scared.
[02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:40.252]  This is the pure baptism in enslavement.
[02:03:41.673 --> 02:03:43.354]  Because we think abortion's good.
[02:03:43.374 --> 02:03:51.821]  I mean, I was thinking about this morning and it really hit me that I need to codify an entire 10-minute special report on this and not just get on the air and talk about it.
[02:03:53.129 --> 02:03:55.610]  And really break down an epiphany I had about abortion.
[02:03:55.890 --> 02:04:09.937]  You know, I knew this about abortion, but it really hit me in like a 5-10 minute epiphany where I just stood there with my hand on the counter after my wife and children had left before I came into the office.
[02:04:09.957 --> 02:04:11.658]  They were gone on some errands.
[02:04:11.718 --> 02:04:14.680]  I just sat there and it all made perfect sense.
[02:04:16.414 --> 02:04:28.218]  Because if you'll say those aren't humans and that that's not a life and you've got that choice and all the excuses, once you have the abortion, you're now committed to that idea and you'll commit to any other rationalization.
[02:04:30.278 --> 02:04:39.241]  Now a lot of people have been involved in abortions and as long as you realize it was wrong what you did and understand the fraud of it, you're cleansed.
[02:04:40.001 --> 02:04:41.622]  It's a great weight off your shoulders.
[02:04:41.962 --> 02:04:42.202]  I know.
[02:04:43.513 --> 02:04:46.676]  But I'll tell you, those of you out there, it is your religion.
[02:04:46.696 --> 02:04:56.244]  When I said women who have all these abortions and love abortion and are proud of it and brag about it, their wombs are temples to human sacrifice.
[02:04:56.284 --> 02:04:57.405]  They are the ultimate Satanists.
[02:04:57.865 --> 02:04:59.187]  They have murdered their children.
[02:04:59.247 --> 02:05:00.368]  We'll be right back with Ron Paul.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:06.704]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[02:05:06.864 --> 02:05:09.966]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:10.186 --> 02:05:12.348]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:05:12.628 --> 02:05:17.152]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:17.432 --> 02:05:23.476]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:05:23.756 --> 02:05:26.938]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:27.298 --> 02:05:31.200]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.461 --> 02:05:36.464]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:36.724 --> 02:05:37.584]  And here's the best news.
[02:05:37.684 --> 02:05:45.309]  A remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[02:05:45.569 --> 02:05:52.514]  To find out why solar generators are the best generators and get $1,700 for doing so, go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:05:52.554 --> 02:05:54.355]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:05:54.595 --> 02:05:56.697]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:05:56.957 --> 02:05:58.958]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:05:59.158 --> 02:06:01.020]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:06:02.614 --> 02:06:07.596]  We just had a terrible storm in the east, but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:06:08.057 --> 02:06:16.161]  We have the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought in agricultural history, and what about the presidential election?
[02:06:16.441 --> 02:06:20.103]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:06:20.423 --> 02:06:24.285]  eFoods Direct is preparing for the shortages, and you had better do the same.
[02:06:24.705 --> 02:06:26.666]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:30.328]  You know that eFoods is the best tasting and safest food on the planet.
[02:06:30.689 --> 02:06:33.871]  We all need a bunch of storable and usable food from eFoods Direct.
[02:06:34.231 --> 02:06:37.854]  None of us wants to be standing in a bread line trading our freedom for food.
[02:06:38.374 --> 02:06:42.497]  Anyone who doesn't take control of their uncertain future has to be just a little bit nuts.
[02:06:42.897 --> 02:06:44.699]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.

[02:06:56.607 --> 02:07:00.060]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:07:01.164 --> 02:07:05.007]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flus, and other illnesses.
[02:07:05.368 --> 02:07:06.769]  Make sure you're not one of them.
[02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:15.336]  Supernatural Silver is a new technology that is highly effective against the germs, bacteria, and fungus that can breed in your chest, throat, and sinuses.

[02:07:27.546 --> 02:07:32.608]  Supernatural silver can be taken daily for prevention and will not create resistant bacteria.
[02:07:32.868 --> 02:07:42.612]  It is non-toxic and is proven to be effective against many of the most serious diseases out there today, such as resistant staph, strep, pneumonia, viruses and flus.
[02:07:43.072 --> 02:07:49.096]  Supernatural Silver is a safe and effective way to fight pathogens where antibiotics and other drugs fail.

[02:08:06.906 --> 02:08:08.247]  We now take you live
[02:08:08.496 --> 02:08:10.460]  To the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:15.489]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:34.651 --> 02:08:37.992]  It is Friday, the ninth day of November 2012.
[02:08:38.472 --> 02:08:39.732]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.233 --> 02:08:47.374]  Ron Paul, soon to be former Congressman Ron Paul, is set to join us in about 30 minutes here on the air.
[02:08:48.235 --> 02:09:00.518]  And obviously he was quoted by the Washington Times and others when he was on Bloomberg Television as saying, America already went over the cliff and we're far gone, and that we have converted to socialism and will collapse.
[02:09:01.573 --> 02:09:02.454]  And that is the plan.
[02:09:02.514 --> 02:09:08.040]  Yes, they're going to collapse us into total tyranny and the domesticated masses will not know any better.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:19.512]  And they will demand anyone who has any money, any property, that everything be taken from you until finally you are physically put in forced labor camps.
[02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:23.716]  That is what every socialist and communist country ends up collapsing into.
[02:09:24.717 --> 02:09:25.718]  If the people put up with it.
[02:09:25.758 --> 02:09:36.183]  That's where it leads is the North Korean, Soviet, Communist, Chinese, Foxcom, Apple, suicide nets around the building, forced abortions inside.
[02:09:36.203 --> 02:09:37.704]  That's where it leads.
[02:09:37.764 --> 02:09:39.225]  That's who these people are.
[02:09:39.625 --> 02:09:40.766]  That's what they create.
[02:09:41.626 --> 02:09:45.889]  That is what they push in every single case.
[02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:47.610]  So, Ron Paul.
[02:09:48.650 --> 02:09:56.491]  The congressman will be joining us to break all of that down later in the hour.
[02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:02.084]  On top of all of that, they're pushing the fiscal cliff.
[02:10:02.264 --> 02:10:04.305]  And this has been done in Europe over and over again.
[02:10:04.325 --> 02:10:22.379]  The globalists, the megabanks that brag that they've conquered our country and the rest of the world through fraud and derivatives and manipulation, hold everyone hostage saying, the economy is going to implode unless you give us carbon taxes, increased carbon taxes, VAT taxes, higher income taxes.
[02:10:22.399 --> 02:10:23.600]  And they call it austerity.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:25.661]  And then the prostitute media
[02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:36.535]  Plays along with it and never points out that almost all the debt is really from bailing out the mega banks themselves.
[02:10:37.175 --> 02:10:43.019]  So that is some of the information that we're going to be covering on that front as well today.
[02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:47.462]  And again, Kohl's election loss could mean gain for carbon tax.
[02:10:47.922 --> 02:10:48.522]  Bloomberg.
[02:10:49.603 --> 02:10:50.143]  The Hill.
[02:10:51.564 --> 02:10:53.606]  Carbon tax could be in Obama's toolbox.
[02:10:54.522 --> 02:10:57.223]  Bloomberg, Obama may levy carbon tax to cut U.S.
[02:10:57.243 --> 02:10:57.643]  deficit.
[02:10:58.143 --> 02:11:00.744]  HSBC says that's where this is going.
[02:11:00.864 --> 02:11:10.028]  On top of a VAT, Obama's set to give a speech today and you know he's going to talk about how we're in trouble, why the economy just imploded the day after I got elected.
[02:11:11.288 --> 02:11:14.970]  Again, the same mega banks that financed to get him back into office.
[02:11:16.314 --> 02:11:29.080]  And Finance Romney, just to make doubly sure they maintain control, either way their guy got in, they dropped the hammer after the election because they'd been somewhat propping it up, because now they're going to the next phase of austerity.
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:38.604]  And when they raise taxes, just like they've done in California, or like they've done in other countries, like Greece and other places, it actually lowers revenue and kills business.
[02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:40.145]  That's the plan.
[02:11:40.825 --> 02:11:44.486]  You don't want people uppity with their own businesses running around with money in the bank.
[02:11:44.886 --> 02:11:46.246]  You want them with their hands out.
[02:11:47.307 --> 02:11:52.968]  That's why they, Chris Matthews has said it, Michael Moore has said it, how great the storm is.
[02:11:53.568 --> 02:11:57.529]  Because it makes you dependent and it teaches you to be dependent.
[02:11:57.869 --> 02:12:01.690]  Of course, we see 11 days without power.
[02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:04.531]  Sandy victims want answers.
[02:12:05.967 --> 02:12:06.787]  We have other reports.
[02:12:06.827 --> 02:12:10.929]  Power outages continue to plague New Jersey, New York, you name it.
[02:12:10.949 --> 02:12:17.712]  A 30-hour wait for fuel offers plenty of intrigue but no gas, New York Daily News.
[02:12:18.352 --> 02:12:21.634]  Gas ratcheting New Yorkers welcomed to the third world.
[02:12:23.171 --> 02:12:24.672]  Ready to snap.
[02:12:24.752 --> 02:12:28.934]  In Cedar Grove, residents are at 10th and 11th day, no power.
[02:12:29.395 --> 02:12:32.416]  What they're really freaking out about is the liquor deliveries aren't happening.
[02:12:32.456 --> 02:12:33.877]  The alcohol has run out.
[02:12:34.377 --> 02:12:37.839]  There's more looting, more crime going on, but the media is keeping it quiet.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.741]  Bitter cold inside disaster shelter.
[02:12:41.221 --> 02:12:46.785]  Even the government shelters in places like Murlborough don't have power.
[02:12:48.446 --> 02:12:52.348]  That's the type of information that we have here.
[02:12:53.857 --> 02:12:54.237]  All right.
[02:12:55.658 --> 02:12:56.739]  Now, there's your government.
[02:12:56.759 --> 02:12:58.459]  11 days won't help you.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:04.262]  But we're bad if we say that you should get prepared.
[02:13:04.342 --> 02:13:22.772]  We're bad if we say you should have a year of food, you should have firearms, you should know how to fix basic stuff in your house or car, you should know how to run a trot line, you should know how to clean a firearm, you should know how to stomp somebody's butt into the ground if they assault you.
[02:13:24.076 --> 02:13:27.007]  But the new religion in America, there's three groups of people really.
[02:13:27.027 --> 02:13:28.814]  There's globalist, technocratic...
[02:13:30.697 --> 02:13:36.599]  Crime syndicates that know the street, know how the world works, have decided to fleece the sheep.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:44.163]  You've got good, hard-working people that try to work within the system that's fraudulent, who are being attacked and destroyed.
[02:13:44.183 --> 02:13:59.509]  And then you have the giant mass of dumbed-down Kim Kardashian fans, who don't even know what day of the week it is, literally, who are in helpless zombie-like states, and all they know how to do is beg and plead and demand that somebody else's stuff is theirs.
[02:14:01.309 --> 02:14:07.011]  They are going to literally, societally, culturally eat us alive.
[02:14:07.551 --> 02:14:08.572]  This has happened everywhere.
[02:14:08.612 --> 02:14:10.472]  It's not like we're just theorizing.
[02:14:10.512 --> 02:14:11.393]  This is guaranteed.
[02:14:11.433 --> 02:14:17.135]  It's like you got gangrene on your leg and your toes are turning black and smelling.
[02:14:17.155 --> 02:14:18.735]  They're going to have to cut those toes off.
[02:14:18.855 --> 02:14:22.157]  And if they don't, you're going to lose the whole leg and then your whole body.
[02:14:22.177 --> 02:14:22.717]  You're going to die.
[02:14:23.462 --> 02:14:27.303]  Well, we have gangrene, flesh-eating bacteria all over us politically, okay?
[02:14:27.583 --> 02:14:33.344]  We're stumbling around, snot's coming out of our nose, our eyes are bloodshot, we've got a 110 fever.
[02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:37.425]  This country is on death's doorstep, which is the plan.
[02:14:38.066 --> 02:14:45.588]  Going from liberty and 4% of the world's population having half the wealth because we weren't perfect, we had more freedom, and so it was a cornucopia.
[02:14:45.628 --> 02:14:47.168]  It was an engine of wealth.
[02:14:47.668 --> 02:14:58.397]  And we became spoiled brats and people learn to sit around or get government jobs and, you know, festoon themselves and convince themselves that they make the earth, you know, turn and the grass grow and the birds sing.
[02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:03.120]  And, uh, I mean, we, look, I've been saying it.
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:04.061]  We're far gone.
[02:15:04.141 --> 02:15:05.002]  We're over the cliff.
[02:15:05.262 --> 02:15:06.023]  It's all designed.
[02:15:06.103 --> 02:15:07.204]  Ron Paul's now saying that.
[02:15:07.744 --> 02:15:11.267]  In fact, guys, will you print me that stack of Ron Paul articles?
[02:15:11.347 --> 02:15:11.607]  Oh, no.
[02:15:11.867 --> 02:15:12.608]  Actually, here they are.
[02:15:12.688 --> 02:15:12.868]  Good.
[02:15:12.908 --> 02:15:13.308]  I found them.
[02:15:13.328 --> 02:15:14.269]  And I know you gave them to me.
[02:15:14.309 --> 02:15:14.870]  I couldn't find them.
[02:15:16.038 --> 02:15:17.799]  Ron Paul, election shows, U.S.
[02:15:17.839 --> 02:15:22.383]  far gone, Washington Times, The Hill, Ron Paul, we're already over the fiscal cliff, yeah, by design.
[02:15:23.564 --> 02:15:28.127]  Ron Paul, America already over the cliff, Wall Street Journal, goes on with it.
[02:15:28.147 --> 02:15:30.609]  Okay, he's gonna come on, we've got questions for him.
[02:15:31.049 --> 02:15:31.910]  The point is...
[02:15:34.773 --> 02:15:37.934]  That this is an engineered situation.
[02:15:38.274 --> 02:15:43.816]  Now, I spent three days making sure of this, and I went and checked at blackboxvoting.org her numbers.
[02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:47.017]  In the past, Bev Harris was pretty much a Democrat.
[02:15:47.117 --> 02:15:49.497]  She calls herself an Independent because she realizes they're all a Mafia.
[02:15:49.998 --> 02:15:52.778]  She helped expose Republican theft of elections.
[02:15:52.818 --> 02:15:55.399]  So, we're not saying Mitt Romney's good.
[02:15:56.159 --> 02:15:57.980]  We had Obama supporters calling yesterday.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.020]  You heard me open the phones for them.
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.861]  We're going to do it again today, later, after Ron Paul leaves us.
[02:16:01.842 --> 02:16:05.029]  And I would say, now listen, my guy didn't lose.
[02:16:05.049 --> 02:16:09.499]  Mitt Romney's a globalist, but the referendum, if you believe this election...
[02:16:10.848 --> 02:16:17.269]  Certifying that people say, yeah, you didn't build that, I want an Obama phone, and the government needs to give us a little something.
[02:16:17.489 --> 02:16:25.691]  We went out and interviewed Obama supporters at the Driscoll, at the Democratic Party of Texas celebration here in the capital city of Texas, Austin, and that's what they were all saying.
[02:16:25.731 --> 02:16:30.272]  Yeah, we need to help people, we need to give people money, give them free health care, give them free education.
[02:16:31.272 --> 02:16:32.852]  There's no such thing as free.
[02:16:33.092 --> 02:16:35.673]  When you start giving out free, it starts debasing everything.
[02:16:37.623 --> 02:16:38.584]  I don't know.
[02:16:55.586 --> 02:17:00.670]  If they would have kicked Obama out, that would have been, hey, incumbents, look out, hey, you know, people are mad.
[02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:17.923]  The fact that things are so bad, Obama's been caught lying so much, NDAA, torture, secret arrest, hiring nothing but lobbyists, signing statements, all the insider deals, shutting down the coal plant, shipping General Motors to China, Solyndra, all the, I mean, just makes Bill Clinton look like a saint.
[02:17:18.063 --> 02:17:20.605]  It's not that Bill Clinton's a saint, he's actually running this administration.
[02:17:20.925 --> 02:17:22.246]  It's a Clinton operation, folks.
[02:17:22.406 --> 02:17:22.947]  It's on record.
[02:17:23.843 --> 02:17:26.386]  It's that things are so far gone now they get away with anything.
[02:17:26.747 --> 02:17:28.389]  Just Department running fast and furious.
[02:17:28.749 --> 02:17:29.611]  The list goes on and on.
[02:17:30.768 --> 02:17:55.305]  And meanwhile they're buying 1.6 billion bullets, they're digging in, they're fortifying police stations, they're training them that gun owners and libertarians are the enemy, that those that don't like world government are the enemy, those of us that understand the takeover, those of us that don't want this to happen, we are now listed as the enemy, and they're putting the internet kill switch in with cyber security, and they're announcing they want the fairness doctrine back to shut us down, and they're doing all sorts of cyber attacks to alternative media.
[02:17:55.805 --> 02:17:56.846]  It's on, folks!
[02:17:57.766 --> 02:17:58.267]  It's on!
[02:18:00.655 --> 02:18:20.971]  Now here's the good news, and I've studied this and I can tell you right now, Bev Harris, vote fraud expert, Romney votes not counted in key states, and if you add up all the places where there was clear fraud that they admit none of the votes were counted on election day, they would just announce it, and the trends were Romney really won those states, Mitt Romney really won.
[02:18:22.418 --> 02:18:28.684]  That's not a good thing, but it's not the worst scenario, because it just shows people at least hitting the reset button.
[02:18:29.324 --> 02:18:32.627]  You know, going, you know what, we don't like what Bush did, we're putting Obama in.
[02:18:33.008 --> 02:18:35.890]  We don't like what Obama did, we're putting Romney in.
[02:18:36.011 --> 02:18:41.155]  At least it shows some primitive inkling of understanding how much trouble we're in.
[02:18:41.195 --> 02:18:44.819]  There's video of Bev Harris breaking it down two days ago, but we went and collated it all
[02:18:45.259 --> 02:18:46.419]  You know, get our own vetting.
[02:18:46.599 --> 02:18:47.219]  It's accurate.
[02:18:47.239 --> 02:18:48.320]  It's a very important article.
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.600]  Because here's the deal, folks.
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:19:00.342]  You don't really believe that most polls showed two-thirds of people wanted GMO labeling in California, but then magically 60% or close to 59% voted against it.
[02:19:01.562 --> 02:19:02.482]  They're still counting votes.
[02:19:02.502 --> 02:19:06.343]  I mean, you don't really believe Californians don't want to have something labeled GMO.
[02:19:06.603 --> 02:19:07.403]  Does anyone buy that?
[02:19:07.703 --> 02:19:08.083]  Does anyone?
[02:19:08.103 --> 02:19:14.264]  When there's admitted election fraud everywhere, and now they call states, you know, when they haven't even counted the day's ballots, they're not even in.
[02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:16.750]  I mean, does anyone believe this?
[02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:17.630]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:19:17.930 --> 02:19:19.671]  The system's totally discredited now.
[02:19:19.951 --> 02:19:23.093]  They're gonna say the voting machines at state level say ban guns.
[02:19:23.453 --> 02:19:27.335]  They're gonna say that, oh, all the new property tax increases passed.
[02:19:27.675 --> 02:19:28.815]  Wow, who would have thought it?
[02:19:29.256 --> 02:19:29.976]  Oh my gosh.
[02:19:30.636 --> 02:19:35.199]  And a few times you have a few state referendums to make it look like you're having some victories.
[02:19:35.499 --> 02:19:41.742]  I'm telling you folks, this is a scientific takeover where they grab power, see if we buy it, okay, they bought it, move forward.
[02:19:42.728 --> 02:19:55.164]  You have to either discredit the whole system, disengage, fight against it every way you can, or we're going into a cross between the Soviet Union, Communist China, Nazi Germany, and Caesar's Rome.
[02:19:55.424 --> 02:19:56.305]  I mean, this is it.
[02:19:56.726 --> 02:19:57.587]  We're in trouble.
[02:19:57.807 --> 02:20:00.811]  And if you don't have goosebumps, you ain't got a heartbeat.
[02:20:02.386 --> 02:20:07.190]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[02:20:07.350 --> 02:20:10.433]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:20:10.633 --> 02:20:12.795]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:20:13.055 --> 02:20:17.559]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:23.745]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:20:24.065 --> 02:20:27.206]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:20:27.566 --> 02:20:31.427]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:20:31.667 --> 02:20:36.628]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:20:36.888 --> 02:20:37.748]  And here's the best news.
[02:20:37.848 --> 02:20:45.410]  A remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.

[02:20:59.085 --> 02:21:00.949]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.

[02:21:07.554 --> 02:21:08.314]  You bet it would!

[02:22:01.806 --> 02:22:04.648]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[02:22:05.008 --> 02:22:10.150]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[02:22:10.611 --> 02:22:15.593]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[02:22:16.234 --> 02:22:18.295]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[02:22:18.815 --> 02:22:24.639]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic any time.
[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:29.683]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:22:30.023 --> 02:22:32.645]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:22:32.905 --> 02:22:38.009]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[02:22:53.058 --> 02:22:53.398]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.646 --> 02:23:05.090]  We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment.
[02:23:05.411 --> 02:23:08.333]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[02:23:08.573 --> 02:23:11.636]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[02:23:11.917 --> 02:23:21.606]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs,
[02:23:21.926 --> 02:23:22.006]  Yeah!
[02:23:42.262 --> 02:23:49.166]  That's rnafreesample.com or call toll-free 888-577-3703.
[02:23:49.326 --> 02:23:53.128]  Pay only shipping and handling for a free 30-day supply of RNA drops.
[02:23:53.268 --> 02:23:58.631]  Get the information you need and the health you want at rnafreesample.com.
[02:24:14.446 --> 02:24:16.607]  A little piece of me, a little piece of you.
[02:24:18.368 --> 02:24:27.112]  We die for the system.
[02:24:28.153 --> 02:24:31.214]  We'll die for the system.
[02:24:33.595 --> 02:24:34.836]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:37.496 --> 02:24:52.749]  So, stocks are falling, people are laying off their employees all over the place, because, you see, we're in a global system designed by the megabanks, and it's designed to shut down the once wealthy economies and convert them over to tyranny.
[02:24:53.650 --> 02:24:54.951]  And the globalists brag about this.
[02:24:54.971 --> 02:24:57.313]  They write about this, but that's in their economic treatises.
[02:24:57.793 --> 02:25:01.515]  The general public just likes to buy into whatever the mainstream media is telling them.
[02:25:01.535 --> 02:25:05.458]  And they're telling them, the government wants you to do great and wants to help the little guys.
[02:25:05.798 --> 02:25:11.222]  And as more people get poor, they think, well, the answer must be government because they say they want to make me rich.
[02:25:11.662 --> 02:25:14.164]  And then government gets bigger, more people get poor.
[02:25:14.904 --> 02:25:17.267]  And they go, well, we better have a bigger government.
[02:25:17.327 --> 02:25:18.709]  That's what makes poor people rich.
[02:25:19.229 --> 02:25:29.061]  And bigger government, more poor people, until we convert from the richest country in the world to a globalist New World Order military colony where they just get conscripts.
[02:25:30.285 --> 02:25:35.448]  And they're coming out with the drone ships, the drone aircraft, the drone submarines, the drone soldiers.
[02:25:35.728 --> 02:25:37.589]  That won't even be needed soon.
[02:25:38.089 --> 02:25:39.490]  You see, the future doesn't need us.
[02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:40.791]  Human life's always been cheap.
[02:25:40.811 --> 02:25:46.073]  But now, because of robotics and automation, we're not even needed, according to The Globalist.
[02:25:46.554 --> 02:25:54.898]  And so they're just shutting down the once-free society so they can convert us into pure authoritarianism ahead of forced population reduction.
[02:25:54.958 --> 02:25:57.980]  That is just some of what's going on.
[02:26:00.259 --> 02:26:05.583]  We did a national poll that I mentioned yesterday on air, but this got published by the time we went off air at 2 p.m.
[02:26:05.603 --> 02:26:06.443]  Central yesterday.
[02:26:06.984 --> 02:26:07.344]  Poll.
[02:26:07.404 --> 02:26:13.348]  Nearly one-third of Americans should accept TSA body cavity search in order to fly.
[02:26:13.408 --> 02:26:19.492]  That was a Harris scientific poll of 2,000 plus adults that we commissioned.
[02:26:19.912 --> 02:26:22.594]  You can read the full poll at InfoWars.com.
[02:26:24.463 --> 02:26:26.085]  And some newspapers picked this up.
[02:26:26.906 --> 02:26:29.229]  But you would imagine that would be a big national story.
[02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:32.533]  But some people are commenting, no, I think they should check us.
[02:26:32.573 --> 02:26:33.414]  There could be a bomb.
[02:26:34.055 --> 02:26:35.296]  Well, why not cut you open?
[02:26:35.336 --> 02:26:37.178]  There could be something in your stomach.
[02:26:37.259 --> 02:26:39.461]  I mean, why not just not let you leave your house?
[02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:41.624]  How about you just live in a little confined to June 21?
[02:26:42.745 --> 02:26:43.285]  I don't know.
[02:27:04.588 --> 02:27:10.298]  In order to fly, and Homeland Security actually has taken bids and had meetings about making everyone wear it.
[02:27:10.959 --> 02:27:14.024]  Shocking survey results show how much freedom Americans are willing to sacrifice.
[02:27:14.304 --> 02:27:17.008]  Of course, they don't care if you don't like it, they'll just try to implement it.
[02:27:18.368 --> 02:27:26.010]  And they already put you in a radiation bath to get your authorization for the safety of everybody, of course.
[02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:27.190]  The government needs to have that happen.
[02:27:27.210 --> 02:27:28.710]  And they grope you, of course, for your safety.
[02:27:29.431 --> 02:27:39.213]  So that's what's happening in the once land of the free and the brave because of Al-Qaeda that the government publicly runs in Libya and Syria and always ran and always will run.
[02:27:40.583 --> 02:27:41.624]  Out of Saudi Arabia!
[02:27:42.025 --> 02:27:48.672]  But it's just so much fun to be Islamophobic, even though the globalists run the radicals and put them in power, that it's like, so what?
[02:27:48.692 --> 02:27:52.015]  Just get rid of my future, get rid of my kids' future, take all my rights.
[02:27:52.215 --> 02:27:55.198]  Hey, but the government manuals that police and military sent us...
[02:27:55.839 --> 02:27:59.780]  An FBI and Federal Marshal sent us over the years that broke, over and over again, National News.
[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:06.342]  It says it's not about Al Qaeda, that it's gun owners returning veterans and farmers and people, anybody that is self-sufficient.
[02:28:06.382 --> 02:28:08.742]  Wow, just like how all authoritarians go after those people.
[02:28:09.102 --> 02:28:10.263]  This is a repeat of history.
[02:28:10.723 --> 02:28:14.324]  Right here, Lennon, Mao, this is important.
[02:28:14.384 --> 02:28:18.545]  And they're like, oh yeah, well, we do need to watch those evil right-wingers.
[02:28:20.645 --> 02:28:22.766]  I mean, they don't want us to get our Obama phone.
[02:28:23.732 --> 02:28:27.334]  I mean, what did Janet Reno say on 60 Minutes back in the mid-90s?
[02:28:27.374 --> 02:28:34.077]  She said the biggest cult in America, the most dangerous people, are quote, evangelical Christians who believe in the second coming of Christ.
[02:28:34.577 --> 02:28:36.958]  Why, you believe in the second coming of Christ?
[02:28:37.298 --> 02:28:38.679]  And that's what they teach in those manuals!
[02:28:40.129 --> 02:28:40.709]  And you know what?
[02:28:40.729 --> 02:28:45.391]  If you're a cop and you go to those intelligence training deals and you don't agree with that, they take note and you're out of there.
[02:28:45.411 --> 02:28:46.312]  You're back on patrol.
[02:28:47.112 --> 02:28:50.814]  We're gonna bust you down from, you know, sergeant back to, uh, on the street, pal.
[02:28:51.154 --> 02:28:53.375]  How about you lose $20,000 a year in your paycheck?
[02:28:54.195 --> 02:28:56.196]  Oh, you don't like shaking people down and writing them tickets all day?
[02:28:56.536 --> 02:29:00.638]  How about you get put back out there, you know, where you started 10 years ago?
[02:29:02.112 --> 02:29:02.873]  Oh, you don't like that?
[02:29:02.913 --> 02:29:04.193]  How about you just get out of here?
[02:29:04.213 --> 02:29:04.914]  And a lot of them do get out.
[02:29:04.934 --> 02:29:07.575]  It's like, good, we got people that are willing to do whatever they're told.
[02:29:07.615 --> 02:29:08.836]  You just get out of the force.
[02:29:09.276 --> 02:29:13.078]  And so the conversion towards pure evil accelerates.
[02:29:14.399 --> 02:29:22.923]  And I want to beg all of you out there to realize that a lot of us have disengaged from the system because we know we don't have a choice within the system when people like Mitt Romney.
[02:29:23.363 --> 02:29:24.524]  But it is a mandate.
[02:29:26.098 --> 02:29:32.403]  It is a vote against liberty that people voted for Obama.
[02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:35.105]  Not that either guy would have done really something different.
[02:29:35.345 --> 02:29:37.567]  It's just that Obama openly says you didn't build that.
[02:29:37.948 --> 02:29:39.149]  Openly that we're collectivist.
[02:29:39.569 --> 02:29:42.811]  Openly that banning all guns is good in the past.
[02:29:43.072 --> 02:29:44.493]  And now he's coming after the guns.
[02:29:44.593 --> 02:29:46.454]  Now they're coming out with the legislation.
[02:29:46.474 --> 02:29:48.176]  They physically want them.
[02:29:48.516 --> 02:29:49.317]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.397 --> 02:29:49.917]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.957 --> 02:29:50.718]  Ron Paul coming up.
[02:29:51.218 --> 02:29:52.119]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.599 --> 02:29:54.101]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.115 --> 02:29:57.806]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.821 --> 02:30:04.903]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[02:30:05.303 --> 02:30:11.026]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:30:11.226 --> 02:30:17.630]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:23.253]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:30:23.513 --> 02:30:27.155]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:30:27.355 --> 02:30:30.918]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[02:30:31.159 --> 02:30:35.543]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[02:30:35.743 --> 02:30:38.065]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[02:30:38.245 --> 02:30:40.427]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[02:30:40.567 --> 02:30:41.788]  The book that woke me up.
[02:30:42.109 --> 02:30:44.931]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:30:45.632 --> 02:30:46.393]  By Rosa Corey.
[02:30:46.513 --> 02:30:49.174]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:30:49.474 --> 02:30:50.415]  The Greater Good.
[02:30:50.755 --> 02:30:56.019]  The most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:30:56.319 --> 02:31:00.561]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[02:31:01.682 --> 02:31:06.944]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:31:07.204 --> 02:31:09.385]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:31:09.605 --> 02:31:18.547]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:18.708 --> 02:31:21.889]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:31:22.149 --> 02:31:23.589]  There's no priming required.
[02:31:23.829 --> 02:31:25.870]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:28.591]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:31:29.671 --> 02:31:31.012]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:31:31.192 --> 02:31:32.513]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:32.633 --> 02:31:35.474]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:35.774 --> 02:31:38.956]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:39.176 --> 02:31:40.957]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:31:41.077 --> 02:31:43.158]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:43.298 --> 02:31:45.900]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:47.360]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:47.621 --> 02:31:50.842]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:31:50.942 --> 02:31:56.565]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:31:56.745 --> 02:31:57.926]  You can also call to order.
[02:32:00.788 --> 02:32:00.908]  888-253-3139.
[02:32:01.808 --> 02:32:06.671]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power, even save money on your electric bill?
[02:32:06.831 --> 02:32:09.933]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:32:10.154 --> 02:32:12.335]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:32:12.575 --> 02:32:17.118]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:32:17.378 --> 02:32:23.441]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:32:23.721 --> 02:32:26.902]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:32:27.242 --> 02:32:31.164]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:32:31.424 --> 02:32:36.406]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:32:36.686 --> 02:32:37.547]  And here's the best news.
[02:32:37.647 --> 02:32:40.628]  A remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now.
[02:32:40.868 --> 02:32:45.290]  That gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[02:32:45.530 --> 02:32:52.474]  To find out why solar generators are the best generators and get $1,700 for doing so, go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:32:52.514 --> 02:32:54.334]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:32:54.575 --> 02:32:56.676]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:32:56.916 --> 02:32:58.917]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:32:59.117 --> 02:33:01.078]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:33:02.498 --> 02:33:10.062]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:17.978 --> 02:33:22.961]  Okay, he is joining us from the road via cell phone so if he cuts out he'll call us right back.
[02:33:23.021 --> 02:33:33.167]  Congressman Ron Paul, he's been a busy man out there speaking to millions of young people around the country and we're doing a great job exposing collectivism and
[02:33:34.007 --> 02:33:43.873]  The path this country's going on, and on this Friday edition, a few days after the election, we have a couple of minutes here, 30 minutes or so, with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:33:44.453 --> 02:33:52.558]  Congressman, I don't know how you do it, holding up under something that a young man couldn't do, but great job getting the message of liberty out during the campaign.
[02:33:53.786 --> 02:33:58.189]  Well, it's been a lot of fun and tedious and of course at times frustrating.
[02:33:58.669 --> 02:34:06.894]  But what really gets me going or keeps me going is what everybody knows is that I have identified with a lot of young people as you have.
[02:34:07.194 --> 02:34:11.157]  You know, I'm going to the campuses and that's why I've never dwelled on D.C.
[02:34:11.577 --> 02:34:12.238]  D.C.
[02:34:12.578 --> 02:34:13.679]  is important, but D.C.
[02:34:13.739 --> 02:34:18.221]  is a reflection of what the next generation is going to be thinking about and realizing.
[02:34:18.261 --> 02:34:20.123]  So that's where I'm optimistic.
[02:34:20.143 --> 02:34:21.904]  Washington is as big as best as ever.
[02:34:22.424 --> 02:34:32.509]  But there's reason to believe that all the freedom organizations, your radio show, we're all making some progress and more in the last five years than we did probably in the previous 20 years.
[02:34:34.326 --> 02:34:35.026]  Absolutely.
[02:34:35.506 --> 02:34:41.887]  Look, Bev Harris, who is, as you know, one of the top voting fraud experts in the country, she's nonpartisan.
[02:34:41.927 --> 02:34:44.568]  She says a lot of Romney votes didn't get counted.
[02:34:44.588 --> 02:34:47.369]  They called states long before they should have.
[02:34:47.689 --> 02:34:49.489]  That article's up at Infowars.com.
[02:34:49.529 --> 02:34:55.350]  I know it looks like you're a spoiled sport if you talk about election fraud, but it's been certified and proven over and over again.
[02:34:55.370 --> 02:34:59.331]  I don't so much see it as a mandate for collectivism
[02:35:00.151 --> 02:35:10.843]  That Obama got re-elected, I see it as a mandate that people have been dumbed down, and that Romney wasn't really a... somebody who was really speaking out against Obama.
[02:35:11.103 --> 02:35:14.426]  But when you make the statement, Congressman, that the U.S.
[02:35:14.486 --> 02:35:18.591]  election shows were far gone, can you elaborate on that?
[02:35:19.889 --> 02:35:23.715]  Well, yes, and the subject comes up because the big talk now is the fiscal cliff.
[02:35:24.336 --> 02:35:29.964]  And in many ways, I work on the assumption that we've sort of gone off the cliff.
[02:35:30.645 --> 02:35:35.111]  Nobody realizes because we haven't hit the bottom and we don't know what the ramifications are.
[02:35:36.052 --> 02:35:54.508]  But in the election, what I was thinking about at that time was that one of the things that Obama was able to do was play on fear, fear of those people, you know, in a rat's belt, who are used to artificially high wages and jobs and bailouts, and he played on that.
[02:35:54.868 --> 02:36:01.053]  So in many ways, it was those individuals in Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin are saying,
[02:36:02.114 --> 02:36:04.876]  You protect me, take care of me, make sure my checks are coming.
[02:36:05.136 --> 02:36:08.638]  And I said it's not a whole lot different than the way they line up on the streets in Greece.
[02:36:08.898 --> 02:36:12.740]  You know, don't cut anything and the people who are on the dole won it.
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:16.222]  So in that way, that side of the argument won.
[02:36:17.803 --> 02:36:27.029]  But I'm not as down on what happened in the election because 12 million decided not to bother, which isn't all that bad, you know, because
[02:36:27.549 --> 02:36:38.213]  They decided they looked at Romney and they looked at Obama and said it's not worth the effort and they know the whole system is rigged against us if we try a third party, so they just said to heck with it.
[02:36:39.253 --> 02:36:40.853]  But I think those are our supporters.
[02:36:41.034 --> 02:36:45.215]  I mean, I think those are the people that probably listen to you and pay attention to me.
[02:36:45.735 --> 02:36:50.116]  But they know that, you know, the current system isn't working.
[02:36:50.576 --> 02:36:51.937]  But I think we're the majority.
[02:36:51.977 --> 02:37:03.460]  There's no doubt in my mind if you take people who have dropped out a while ago or dropping out now and not enthusiastic, wouldn't vote for either of them, I think they're listening more to what we're saying.
[02:37:03.956 --> 02:37:05.117]  That was my next question.
[02:37:05.177 --> 02:37:20.188]  I saw some of the breakdowns in areas of Florida and other places where there were massively less Republican voters just not voting this time around than voted four years ago with McCain and Obama.
[02:37:20.749 --> 02:37:22.890]  And I looked at the numbers and the demographics.
[02:37:22.930 --> 02:37:23.711]  I think you're alluding to this.
[02:37:23.791 --> 02:37:25.192]  I'd like you to expand on it, Congressman.
[02:37:25.452 --> 02:37:28.835]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us if you just tuned in live here on this Friday edition.
[02:37:29.315 --> 02:37:43.852]  That it is the Ron Paul Libertarian Constitutional True America group that was snubbed and demonized and attacked and drummed out by the Rockefeller Blue Blood Republicans that just didn't vote.
[02:37:44.212 --> 02:37:47.114]  I mean, I know that I ended up not voting because of that.
[02:37:47.194 --> 02:37:51.037]  Richard Reeves, one of my crew members who was one of your delegates, he ended up not doing that.
[02:37:51.397 --> 02:37:57.701]  Most Republicans and conservatives and libertarians I've talked to just said, hey, let Obama come in and bring in total communism.
[02:37:58.001 --> 02:37:59.923]  Let's let everybody really see what this is like.
[02:38:00.323 --> 02:38:07.948]  No more of these fake Republicans who are basically exactly the same, Republican in name only, counterfeit conservatives.
[02:38:08.808 --> 02:38:12.851]  I mean, what I'm hearing is people are voting by buying four or five million guns a month.
[02:38:15.052 --> 02:38:17.833]  They're done.
[02:38:17.873 --> 02:38:31.335]  People are humping down and they realize this and the big question, the big job we had is when the major crisis is, the really big one, is you know there will be a revamping.
[02:38:31.355 --> 02:38:42.297]  There's always a restoration of a currency that people can at least trust for a while or are told to trust it and they have to have restored confidence in a government.
[02:38:42.837 --> 02:38:53.986]  And right now, though, the contest is between us who would like very limited federal government and a lot of self-government versus those who want to march onward.
[02:38:54.006 --> 02:38:59.810]  I don't usually use the word carelessly, but on to a form of, you know, just socialism.
[02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:02.652]  But it's a form of socialism that's called fascism.
[02:39:03.033 --> 02:39:07.596]  And that's why I dread the combination of big government and big corporations.
[02:39:07.616 --> 02:39:08.577]  And when you look at that,
[02:39:08.877 --> 02:39:22.448]  Whether it's medical care or the media or the military, the Goldman Sachs and the banking industry, that's who's been in charge, and they're going to hang on tenaciously.
[02:39:22.868 --> 02:39:37.940]  So our challenge is very great, but our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds, and people, because of the crisis, they're looking elsewhere because they know that the economic policy of Keynesian and the inflation of the Fed
[02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:42.101]  They're not confident that they can do it again.
[02:39:43.541 --> 02:39:55.483]  There's a term out there, Obamaism or Obamnaism, basically communism, and you just said it as someone who studied history and also finance and economics.
[02:39:55.883 --> 02:40:03.645]  They're always saying, oh we have the choice of fascism or socialism and the extreme of socialism communism, but Stalin and Hitler had a
[02:40:04.844 --> 02:40:05.744]  Pax together.
[02:40:06.625 --> 02:40:08.186]  They divided Poland in half.
[02:40:08.266 --> 02:40:10.887]  Stalin admired Hitler and adopted much of what he did.
[02:40:12.608 --> 02:40:15.709]  Mussolini and Hitler were actually national socialists.
[02:40:16.409 --> 02:40:23.012]  They socialized things for the general public, but allowed mega-robber barons to have a centralized fascist economy.
[02:40:23.253 --> 02:40:30.116]  And historically, that's what I've seen, just studying history myself, is you get a socialism or communism on the bottom with powerful
[02:40:31.116 --> 02:40:38.241]  Exempt elites or empires that are incredibly wealthy with the general public fighting over scraps.
[02:40:38.421 --> 02:40:47.907]  I mean this is the type of real definition we need out there that liberalism we hear about is not liberal at all like Thomas Jefferson, a real liberal.
[02:40:48.147 --> 02:40:50.209]  This is a virulent authoritarianism.
[02:40:51.288 --> 02:41:03.438]  Yeah, and when these changes occur, if National Socialism is defeated, they have no trouble becoming Communists.
[02:41:03.638 --> 02:41:09.703]  And the Communists in Russia, the KGB, became sort of, you know, corporatists, you know.
[02:41:09.723 --> 02:41:11.845]  All of a sudden, that was amazing to me.
[02:41:11.945 --> 02:41:17.209]  In five years, they get these billionaires, and then I found out that it was the KGB that ended up
[02:41:17.509 --> 02:41:19.010]  I think most of the big businesses.
[02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:28.858]  They did have more of a market economy, and you can't complain about the Soviets falling apart, but really, many of the same people stayed in charge, so they're very flexible.
[02:41:28.878 --> 02:41:32.882]  They want power and money and control, and what they call it is secondary to that.
[02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:48.100]  Sure, and again, the proper definition of Obamunism, which I hope everybody adopts, is the high-tax, big-government, economic growth-killing, centrally-planned economic regime favored by Barack Hussein Obama, essentially the same as communism and socialism.
[02:41:49.181 --> 02:41:53.985]  And, I mean, if this isn't Obamunism, I don't know what is, Congressman.
[02:41:54.005 --> 02:42:01.090]  When you talk about, we're already over the cliff, when you talk about, you know, we are basically far gone,
[02:42:01.810 --> 02:42:02.930]  That's not negativity.
[02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:07.852]  That's historically being accurate in my well-researched view.
[02:42:07.872 --> 02:42:09.132]  But can you flesh it out?
[02:42:09.152 --> 02:42:11.632]  You know, you talked a few years ago about something big is coming.
[02:42:11.952 --> 02:42:13.713]  Break down where we're going.
[02:42:13.733 --> 02:42:20.655]  Because I've seen numbers even in the Wall Street Journal that our per capita government debt, individual debt, is far above Greece's even.
[02:42:21.035 --> 02:42:30.317]  And so how you expect historically, you've predicted so much of this, what you expect to now unfold as we see the economy imploding just days after Obama gets back in?
[02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:37.834]  I was always impressed with talking with the young people on the campuses and telling them how bad I see things.
[02:42:38.214 --> 02:42:42.036]  And then the comments afterwards when I would talk to them, they said, you're the only one that gives me hope.
[02:42:42.096 --> 02:42:44.058]  And they come across very optimistic.
[02:42:44.118 --> 02:42:50.662]  And I think knowing the truth and what to do and offering them something else is a reason for optimism.
[02:42:50.882 --> 02:42:55.385]  But my point about us being over the cliff means that
[02:42:56.305 --> 02:43:05.671]  I don't work on the assumption that all of a sudden there's going to be an agreement in December or January and they're going to solve spending and deficit problems in the entire way.
[02:43:05.692 --> 02:43:08.353]  Nah, that's not going to happen.
[02:43:08.373 --> 02:43:12.796]  So we're over the cliff in that sense and we're falling off.
[02:43:12.856 --> 02:43:15.278]  We just don't know the entire consequences of this.
[02:43:15.738 --> 02:43:23.625]  So I see the consequence being that there will be more and more debt and more and more inflation.
[02:43:23.925 --> 02:43:28.790]  The money will finally come out and start bidding up the prices even more so.
[02:43:29.350 --> 02:43:37.758]  And today I wrote a little thing commenting on the Germans wanting to get their gold holdings out of the Fed holdings in New York.
[02:43:38.358 --> 02:43:50.242]  And I said, maybe this is the crack in the seams where they're losing confidence of the supremacy of the dollar, as well as the supremacy of our political system.
[02:43:50.482 --> 02:43:56.384]  You know, we went through depressions, we went through world wars, and we always came out on top.
[02:43:56.724 --> 02:44:00.445]  You know, people said, and even now, I mean, we're still on top.
[02:44:01.325 --> 02:44:10.408]  In the sense that when they have a crisis day in the market, people will still buy those stupid government bonds, you know, because they don't know where else to go.
[02:44:10.668 --> 02:44:15.269]  But I think this idea that the Germans are saying, hey, do you really have our gold?
[02:44:15.289 --> 02:44:17.570]  And what if they find out there's gold isn't there?
[02:44:17.610 --> 02:44:23.192]  What if they decide to go along with our concern and check and say, tell us where our gold is as well?
[02:44:23.852 --> 02:44:44.685]  And that, to me, will combine with the recognition that the war that we took upon ourselves, the drone war, and the unwarranted, continuous bombing in this global war on terrorism, is going to be something that we can't handle, because just having a lot of nukes on submarines can't solve those problems.
[02:44:45.245 --> 02:44:53.170]  And if we get weakened with our dollar and financially, I think we'll be a paper tiger militarily
[02:44:53.790 --> 02:45:04.354]  And then I see what would happen then is a movement for all the countries that we have belittled and badgered and, you know, bombed.
[02:45:04.874 --> 02:45:07.635]  They're going to love to come piling on us.
[02:45:08.176 --> 02:45:19.220]  And it'll be interesting to see if the next year or two this whole thing about what Germany's talking about might not be the opening salvo on an international attack on our dollar.
[02:45:19.969 --> 02:45:20.029]  And
[02:45:37.128 --> 02:45:37.588]  I don't think so.
[02:45:58.121 --> 02:46:04.346]  Also, 30% or nearly a third in the same Harris poll said they would accept a TSA body cavity search.
[02:46:05.186 --> 02:46:07.528]  This is not satire, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:07.788 --> 02:46:16.154]  Congressman, you yourself have complained of the abuse at their hands, and now we've seen other Congress people complain of it, and it's getting more intense.
[02:46:16.755 --> 02:46:21.638]  What is your take on the 1.6 billion bullets now being purchased by Homeland Security?
[02:46:21.678 --> 02:46:26.782]  What is your take on the TSA now on the highways, all of this expansion of the police state?
[02:46:27.659 --> 02:46:29.200]  Well, it's all preparation.
[02:46:29.220 --> 02:46:32.721]  They say just in case there's an emergency, we have to restore order.
[02:46:33.901 --> 02:46:37.362]  Some of them are probably sincere in the sense that we can't control events.
[02:46:37.403 --> 02:46:38.763]  They didn't control events.
[02:46:39.203 --> 02:46:40.744]  They didn't know when the storm was coming.
[02:46:41.004 --> 02:46:45.786]  But if it does occur, you know, they want to... Order is what they want.
[02:46:46.026 --> 02:46:46.886]  They want order.
[02:46:47.346 --> 02:46:55.149]  And therefore, it doesn't prove that they have something absolutely planned on paper, exactly what they're going to do and when.
[02:46:55.769 --> 02:46:59.512]  But they also know the fragility of the system, like we know.
[02:46:59.572 --> 02:47:00.513]  We know it's fragile.
[02:47:00.933 --> 02:47:08.359]  And we know that whether it's a storm or a financial crisis, that people are going to get unruly.
[02:47:09.099 --> 02:47:19.467]  And my argument is that it is a moral issue, but there's a lot of morality that needs to be taught because people who give out government services
[02:47:21.069 --> 02:47:25.833]  They believe themselves to be very moral, just like, you know, the thug on the street.
[02:47:25.853 --> 02:47:29.476]  He doesn't necessarily lay awake at night for what he has done wrong.
[02:47:30.177 --> 02:47:45.110]  But I think as the government breaks down and can't provide the services, that immorality will be expanded with the people, and the people will say, well, the government has to do this, and they're not forthcoming, so therefore I am going to take what is rightfully my own.
[02:47:45.570 --> 02:47:56.737]  And I think our enemies know that and they'll say, well, even though they have pretended that they were going to take care of everybody who needs help, they're really there to control them.
[02:47:56.917 --> 02:47:58.978]  So this is why I think they lay these plans.
[02:47:59.178 --> 02:48:04.602]  But it is rather scary, especially since the founders didn't even want a national police force.
[02:48:04.822 --> 02:48:08.384]  We shouldn't have any federal agents other than our military to have guns.
[02:48:08.764 --> 02:48:10.985]  And now we have hundreds of thousands.
[02:48:11.046 --> 02:48:12.026]  I don't know the exact number.
[02:48:12.046 --> 02:48:12.526]  I know it's over 100,000.
[02:48:13.667 --> 02:48:20.068]  Federal agents who are carrying guns, and that number is going to continue to expand.
[02:48:20.168 --> 02:48:22.509]  It looks like they have a lot of guns if they're buying a lot of bullets.
[02:48:23.289 --> 02:48:35.231]  So basically, do you agree with my boil-down that they know the collapse is coming, they're digging in for it, while telling the public it's bad to basically be a prepper?
[02:48:35.491 --> 02:48:38.571]  I mean, why doesn't government want us to be preppers?
[02:48:38.951 --> 02:48:42.732]  Eleven days without power now in many areas of New York and New Jersey.
[02:48:43.172 --> 02:48:45.535]  And all government is doing is frustrating the efforts.
[02:48:45.575 --> 02:48:51.081]  It's churches and citizens that did prepare that are actually holding things together and giving their neighbors food.
[02:48:51.482 --> 02:48:54.505]  Some estimates are more than 60% made no preparation.
[02:48:55.086 --> 02:48:56.748]  They're just begging the government.
[02:48:57.148 --> 02:49:03.696]  That's the Obama disaster plan, is to have just, I guess, a can, a bucket you beg for government handouts from.
[02:49:04.121 --> 02:49:06.042]  Yeah, but that'll come going in.
[02:49:06.062 --> 02:49:14.269]  I don't know if you saw it, but this picture should be used by all of us to show exactly how efficient they are.
[02:49:14.569 --> 02:49:17.891]  Did you see the picture of the FEMA office up in New York?
[02:49:18.232 --> 02:49:28.739]  They had the storm, and then the Northeastern come in, and the snow came, and the sign says, FEMA office closed due to weather.
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:30.661]  Yes, I did see that.
[02:49:32.745 --> 02:49:33.686]  In fact, guys, pull it up.
[02:49:33.766 --> 02:49:35.248]  FEMA office closed due to weather.
[02:49:35.288 --> 02:49:36.089]  It's all over the place.
[02:49:36.329 --> 02:49:37.770]  We can show people watching on TV.
[02:49:37.810 --> 02:49:39.072]  Isn't that something else?
[02:49:39.152 --> 02:49:42.095]  That is so symbolic of the idiocy.
[02:49:42.575 --> 02:49:52.726]  And, you know, people always, you know, they went after me for having condemned FEMA for so long and voting against it in spite of the fact that I took care of a coastal district.
[02:49:53.626 --> 02:50:03.312]  I won that argument over with my constituents because I did more to help them get around the bureaucracy and get through the bureaucracy.
[02:50:03.352 --> 02:50:09.756]  When the police or the feds wouldn't allow them to go in and get their property, we would go to bat for them.
[02:50:09.816 --> 02:50:14.860]  The people themselves are a little bit further ahead than the politicians and the media people think they are.
[02:50:15.794 --> 02:50:16.455]  Absolutely.
[02:50:16.795 --> 02:50:19.777]  Congressman, moving quickly now in the last ten minutes we have left with you.
[02:50:21.298 --> 02:50:24.500]  What do you expect Obama to do now that he's got four more years?
[02:50:24.621 --> 02:50:28.904]  In his victory speech, he talked about how we're a collective, we're not individuals.
[02:50:29.504 --> 02:50:32.006]  Very creepy kind of you-didn't-build-it statements again.
[02:50:32.766 --> 02:50:37.430]  He's got constituents literally that just beg incoherently for their free Obama phones.
[02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:40.792]  I'm not trying to be mean, it's just very, very sad what dependency does to people.
[02:50:41.873 --> 02:50:42.333]  And now,
[02:50:43.234 --> 02:50:46.496]  They are just racing ahead saying, you end gun treaty.
[02:50:46.756 --> 02:50:51.440]  And now Dianne Feinstein, it's on record, says she physically wants California style.
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:53.621]  Not just a ban on sale of semi-autos.
[02:50:53.861 --> 02:50:55.202]  They want you to turn them in.
[02:50:55.602 --> 02:50:57.644]  I mean, that could cause a civil war, Congressman.
[02:50:57.844 --> 02:50:59.405]  People are not turning their guns in.
[02:51:01.326 --> 02:51:02.006]  That's right.
[02:51:02.247 --> 02:51:05.929]  And, you know, politically, they generally back off on that.
[02:51:05.949 --> 02:51:08.691]  You know, in the last several presidential elections, even this one,
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:12.742]  Obama didn't campaign on stricter gun control.
[02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:22.270]  That doesn't mean he won't work for them, but he knows politically it's not popular, and I think those are the, you know, drawing the lines in the sand.
[02:51:22.650 --> 02:51:28.375]  If they knock on the door, they want your gold and want your gun, I don't think people are going to give them up.
[02:51:29.015 --> 02:51:32.859]  But that doesn't put them out of business to harass us.
[02:51:33.119 --> 02:51:41.206]  They're going to maybe put more limits on buying ammunition, you know, more taxes on it.
[02:51:41.266 --> 02:51:48.812]  They're going to make it more difficult for you to sell your gold or use your gold and maybe have 50, 70% tax on your gold.
[02:51:49.673 --> 02:51:56.899]  And they will do this, but that'll just drive the underground economy, you know, to a much greater height.
[02:51:57.619 --> 02:52:00.281]  But they will continue to do that.
[02:52:00.301 --> 02:52:02.682]  I don't know how this treaty will pan out.
[02:52:02.842 --> 02:52:08.106]  I keep always wanting to be a bit optimistic and say, they can't possibly do that.
[02:52:08.346 --> 02:52:10.807]  That's going against the grain.
[02:52:10.827 --> 02:52:17.291]  So once again, it's going to be up to us to reach people and not reach in our hardcore friends.
[02:52:17.671 --> 02:52:25.136]  I mean, that's why we have to reach out to a new audience as well and say that they have to join us in these efforts.
[02:52:25.716 --> 02:52:37.186]  And I'm hopeful for that because we do have the Internet, you know, and I know they're trying to attack us there, but we're still able to get more information.
[02:52:37.206 --> 02:52:46.014]  Right now, we're riding high on our Internet abilities compared to the three major TV networks.
[02:52:46.174 --> 02:52:46.774]  Absolutely.
[02:52:46.794 --> 02:52:53.400]  Are you concerned about the Internet kill switch, cybersecurity, and all these calls to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine for talk radio?
[02:52:54.053 --> 02:53:06.604]  Yeah, I am concerned, but I also hope that technology is so big and so broad that, you know, the private market is able to overcome any obstacle.
[02:53:06.964 --> 02:53:09.926]  And I don't understand exactly how all that works.
[02:53:09.966 --> 02:53:11.087]  Sure.
[02:53:11.187 --> 02:53:15.971]  I hope I'm not naive to think that people can, you know, develop their own protection.
[02:53:16.292 --> 02:53:21.656]  But ultimately, the only thing that counts, whether it's guns, or gold, or the Internet, or war, is to
[02:53:22.557 --> 02:53:22.798]  Sure.
[02:53:28.376 --> 02:53:33.921]  Sure, expanding on that in the limited time we have left, going to move quick now, Congressman, because I want to get to several other points here.
[02:53:34.602 --> 02:53:41.048]  I'm very glad to see that you've taken back over Campaign for Liberty now that you're not running for president and about to finish up there with Congress.
[02:53:41.288 --> 02:53:42.669]  So congratulations on that.
[02:53:42.709 --> 02:53:49.435]  Very exciting to see you in there, because I know you know like nobody else can drive it right with all the grassroots.
[02:53:49.916 --> 02:53:54.080]  What do you make of the Republicans and this new spin that Republicans need to get
[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:56.020]  I don't think so.
[02:54:14.181 --> 02:54:21.466]  Yeah, it's just diversion, because from where we are in this country today, and when we look at our political system, we only have one party.
[02:54:21.486 --> 02:54:22.547]  So we're already there.
[02:54:22.987 --> 02:54:25.588]  It's just tone and rhetoric is slightly different.
[02:54:25.849 --> 02:54:27.950]  But yeah, they may move a little bit in that direction.
[02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:31.452]  And what they say has nothing much to do with what they do.
[02:54:31.472 --> 02:54:36.696]  And that's why, you know, we have to watch what they do and where they go.
[02:54:38.017 --> 02:54:41.479]  But going in that direction, of course, would be the obviously wrong thing.
[02:54:41.859 --> 02:54:50.465]  And I think it's becoming more clear, because we don't know the exact numbers of support that we had in the campaign, but it's bigger than they gave us credit for.
[02:54:51.006 --> 02:54:55.209]  And I keep thinking of those 12 million that refused to vote.
[02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:58.451]  Some of them, a large number of those are sympathetic to us.
[02:54:59.632 --> 02:55:05.076]  So therefore, you know, our numbers outside are significant.
[02:55:05.396 --> 02:55:05.776]  Sure.
[02:55:20.370 --> 02:55:21.031]  Absolutely.
[02:55:21.171 --> 02:55:23.333]  They can only steal from one group to give it to the other.
[02:55:23.993 --> 02:55:27.276]  And as it gets clearer and clearer that big government doesn't work, it'll finally implode.
[02:55:27.296 --> 02:55:29.818]  That's why we've just got to keep working, keep getting the word out.
[02:55:30.499 --> 02:55:37.965]  Congressman, is it time for people to apologize to you and myself and others for talking about the Bilderberg Group and the Davos New World Order crowd?
[02:55:38.245 --> 02:55:44.831]  Because now in the Financial Times of London, Reuters, AP, they say there is a global government, technocrats, mega bankers,
[02:55:45.211 --> 02:55:50.577]  They're going to run the countries, they're going to appoint the leaders, they're going to get us at a fiscal cliff, hold us hostage.
[02:55:50.597 --> 02:55:56.163]  I want to play you a brief clip here from the Kudlow Report where they announced we're slaves to international bankers.
[02:55:56.423 --> 02:55:57.945]  Here's that clip, Congressman Paul.
[02:55:58.986 --> 02:56:00.908]  Mostly what they do is hold summits.
[02:56:01.748 --> 02:56:06.291]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[02:56:06.331 --> 02:56:08.553]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[02:56:09.113 --> 02:56:11.154]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:56:11.254 --> 02:56:13.696]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[02:56:13.756 --> 02:56:18.619]  Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[02:56:18.719 --> 02:56:19.079]  Fine.
[02:56:19.399 --> 02:56:22.902]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[02:56:23.002 --> 02:56:26.384]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt
[02:56:27.124 --> 02:56:35.914]  And then all four guests agree we're under world government.
[02:56:35.954 --> 02:56:40.779]  They're bragging we're under world government, but then I hear we're not supposed to talk about it, Congressman.
[02:56:41.139 --> 02:56:43.362]  Isn't this our strength and not our weakness?
[02:56:43.582 --> 02:56:44.923]  That we've been right about this?
[02:56:45.244 --> 02:56:47.967]  Instead now we're being told we should not talk about this?
[02:56:49.244 --> 02:56:51.286]  Well, obviously we should talk about it.
[02:56:51.306 --> 02:56:54.249]  The fact that they don't want us to means that we really have to talk about it.
[02:56:54.689 --> 02:57:06.060]  I've written a speech that hopefully I get enough time to give on the House floor, a farewell speech, and I listed five major problems that we face, and one of those five is international government.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:10.144]  You know, the fact that it's the UN, WTO, IMF, and
[02:57:10.684 --> 02:57:17.151]  And the World Bank taking over, deciding when we go to war and how to deal with trade.
[02:57:17.571 --> 02:57:18.332]  The whole works.
[02:57:18.692 --> 02:57:25.699]  So I would say giving up our national sovereignty is bad enough that we've given up individual and state sovereignty to our federal government.
[02:57:26.019 --> 02:57:29.701]  But I see the giving up of our national sovereignty to internationalism.
[02:57:30.241 --> 02:57:33.543]  And they claim, well, they need the WTO to have free trade.
[02:57:33.803 --> 02:57:38.406]  They need the WTO to protect the powerful trading special interests, the internationalists.
[02:57:38.426 --> 02:57:40.907]  So, yes, that is a big issue.
[02:57:41.207 --> 02:57:48.111]  But don't hold your breath on getting your apology, because I don't think Chris Matthews is going to call you or Rush Limbaugh is going to call you in the next week or two.
[02:57:48.491 --> 02:57:49.111]  Absolutely.
[02:57:49.151 --> 02:57:50.952]  Well, we've only got a minute and a half left.
[02:57:51.012 --> 02:57:52.873]  Congressman, I hope you can come back again soon.
[02:57:52.893 --> 02:57:55.654]  I don't want to kill you, literally, and making you work so hard.
[02:57:55.674 --> 02:57:58.595]  But thank you so much for coming on the broadcast.
[02:57:58.755 --> 02:58:02.076]  In closing, we just want to thank you for all you've done.
[02:58:02.096 --> 02:58:12.940]  And can you talk about also the vindication that they now admit all over the news, LA Times, you name it, that al-Qaeda was put in by the UN and NATO and our government in Libya, now in Syria.
[02:58:14.145 --> 02:58:15.366]  We'll fade the music down for a moment.
[02:58:15.987 --> 02:58:18.269]  And is now blowing back on us again.
[02:58:18.529 --> 02:58:19.390]  Your comment on that?
[02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:28.497]  Yeah, well, it shouldn't surprise any of us, because I think that started just at the very beginning, I made some projections on that.
[02:58:28.537 --> 02:58:33.221]  And before you knew it, the weapons and the support we were given to certain groups were turned against us.
[02:58:34.562 --> 02:58:36.564]  But I don't have to be a genius.
[02:58:36.764 --> 02:58:38.205]  You don't have to be a genius to figure it out.
[02:58:38.265 --> 02:58:39.566]  Very well said, Congressman.
[02:58:44.437 --> 02:58:48.460]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:53.844 --> 02:59:01.529]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:59:01.969 --> 02:59:05.532]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
