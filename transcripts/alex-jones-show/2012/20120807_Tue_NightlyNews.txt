[00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:43.215]  It's Tuesday, August 7th, 2012.
[00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:45.276]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:51.720]  Strap yourselves in for an extremely important edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.800]  Straight ahead.
[00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:01.409]  Marvel comic books could not have come up with a better creature than Dick Cheney.
[00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.231]  And people believe them?
[00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:07.677]  How could any self-respecting person follow these people?
[00:01:08.037 --> 00:01:09.359]  They're destroying us.
[00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.722]  They're destroying our nation.
[00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:13.304]  And no one seems to care.
[00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:13.784]  Sure!
[00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:21.946]  Trends Research Institute's Gerald Solente discusses the rot at the top of the pyramid as his predictions come into view.
[00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:27.888]  Then, the Sikh shooter's links to the FBI's National Alliance uncovered.
[00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.809]  Plus, full spectrum dominance.
[00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.150]  All that and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.868]  First story tonight is the aftermath of the tragic shooting that killed six, seven, including the gunman, in Wisconsin.
[00:01:55.508 --> 00:02:02.035]  This is right out of central casting via the FBI and the Globalist who've been caught provocateuring events before.
[00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.459]  We know this guy was Army Psychological Warfare.
[00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:12.877]  Of course, with the Batman shooting under government control, government psychiatrists, it's always the same M.O.
[00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:13.957]  over and over again.
[00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:17.779]  You have multiple witnesses on the news saying four shooters.
[00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.941]  You have the president of the Sikh temple coming out and saying that they were being cased in the days before.
[00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:31.178]  It's all there, and he's now been connected to the National Alliance that basically is FBI run.
[00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:35.539]  It's like we told you, Hal Turner was an FBI asset, and that letter came out in court.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680]  This is exactly how they operate.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.943]  Now what they'll do is they'll have one of their informants, like this guy, who's infiltrated the white supremacist group, they'll have him there at the event, not knowing the other three shooters,
[00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:51.485]  Are all special forces, FBI types, they'll just kill the patsy there on the site.
[00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:56.307]  Or, one of the operatives may have been killed before they set up the patsy by the police officer.
[00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.568]  We're not sure, but it fits the classic MO.
[00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.830]  Remember, they'd stage Fast and Furious to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.511]  Operation Northwoods describes how to have mass shootings and blame patsies.
[00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:07.972]  They would do it here.
[00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:10.113]  So, very, very suspicious.
[00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:14.895]  Why are all these people on government payroll, or former, you know, PSYOP-type people?
[00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:17.403]  Continuing, U.S.
[00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:30.428]  Army to be used against insurrectionist Tea Party and an Army College program is breaking down that they believe that the Tea Party
[00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.669]  ...are going to work with Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:45.321]  It actually says we'll link up with Al-Qaeda to wage war against the loving federal government that used Al-Qaeda to take over Syria and, of course, before that Libya.
[00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:50.466]  And believe it or not, I told you they're going to try to say that people who love liberty are Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:56.848]  It doesn't matter if the global bankers actually run Al-Qaeda, this is the narrative that they are putting out.
[00:03:57.448 --> 00:04:12.511]  It's full spectrum operations in the homeland, a vision of the future, and the army colonel has ignited a firestorm with the article on crushing a Tea Party insurgency that is from theexaminer.com.
[00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:15.752]  Now, expanding on all of this,
[00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:25.356]  This is exactly what we see mirrored in the actual Army training manuals and in the Homeland Security MIAC and other Homeland Security reports.
[00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:28.598]  Returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, farmers, ranchers.
[00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:29.659]  I've been to the urban drills.
[00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.761]  They practice killing farmers wearing overalls and John Deere hats.
[00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.603]  And they're now saying the threat is in Al Qaeda.
[00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:40.553]  The threat is the American people.
[00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:45.555]  People that don't want foreign banks taking over our country as they have been bragging.
[00:04:46.096 --> 00:04:49.037]  Now, it won't matter soon because none of us will be able to have children.
[00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:55.801]  Humans, roughly every 20 years or so, have children.
[00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:57.282]  So, roughly
[00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:00.409]  A generation is 20 years.
[00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.634]  On average you live about 75 years, but a generation is about 20 because you have children every 20 or so.
[00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:15.522]  And in literally dozens of studies with hamsters over the years that we've covered, the GMO crops put out by a whole host of
[00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:16.936]  I don't know.
[00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:39.873]  And they go over all the different problems that the hamsters have, but that's standard.
[00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:45.098]  You wonder why the public, autism's off the charts, disorders of the gut are off the charts, all these problems.
[00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:52.585]  That is a little gift via the New World Order, who promised they would engineer food 50 years ago to sterilize us and make us adult.
[00:05:53.806 --> 00:06:00.690]  You see, the global psychopaths have to be the elite, so they have to brain damage us and hurt us, so they can be better than us.
[00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.012]  That's all part of their sick program, all part of their sick joke.
[00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:07.654]  They get to feel superior whenever they see the public that they're killing.
[00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:15.939]  That's why Monsanto scientists, for more than 10 years, refused to eat GMO crops in their own cafeterias.
[00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.419]  Look it up.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.661]  Speaking of
[00:06:19.705 --> 00:06:26.389]  Frankenfood and Frankenscience, yummy digestible microchips embedded in drugs.
[00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:32.492]  And they've got a whole bunch of companies that have gotten FDA approval to have sensors in the pills.
[00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.654]  And they say they have to do this to make sure you're not taking too many of them.
[00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:38.756]  This will track everything you're doing and control you.
[00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:41.938]  After all, it's a Control Freaks world.
[00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:55.852]  Continuing right along, I remember more than six, seven years ago, I saw RoboRat in the news, where they have microchips in rats' brains that are remote-controlled to go in and find people that have been trapped in buildings or whatever.
[00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:57.053]  It's always for the greater good.
[00:06:57.413 --> 00:07:00.675]  Well, RT reports Pentagon to recruit bomb-sniffing rats.
[00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:14.053]  To go out and find the IEDs they claim are going to be on all our highways as the veterans, the main enemy, not Al Qaeda, attack the loving banker government and the collaborators that work with them.
[00:07:15.094 --> 00:07:20.895]  Continuing here, the Daily Mail reports, is not joining Facebook a sign you're a psychopath?
[00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.036]  Some employers and psychologists
[00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:27.753]  Say, staying away from social media is suspicious.
[00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:28.693]  Yeah.
[00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:31.734]  This is out of England, but it's also happening in the U.S.
[00:07:32.454 --> 00:07:41.518]  And I remember reports by Homeland Security a few years ago saying if somebody keeps their desk locked or isn't in social media, they might be a terrorist.
[00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:52.763]  I mean, you know, the fact that you don't want to be on there talking to people all day and sharing your personal information online so someone can rob your house is a sign you're not a good little globalist.
[00:07:53.841 --> 00:08:01.024]  Continuing, Council on Foreign Relations Strategist praises Al-Qaeda bombings in Syria.
[00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:05.466]  Winston, we were never at war with Eurasia.
[00:08:05.506 --> 00:08:12.428]  That, of course, is an allusion to 1984, where you're never at war with Eurasia, never at war with East Asia, but the next day you've always been at war with them.
[00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:18.591]  The Syria rebels would be immeasurably weaker today without Al-Qaeda in their ranks.
[00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:25.301]  By and large, Free Syrian Army or FSA battalions are tired, divided, chaotic and ineffective.
[00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:33.145]  Feeling abandoned by the West, rebel forces are increasingly demoralized as they square off with the Assad regime's superior weaponry and professional army.
[00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:37.355]  writes the senior fellow at the Middle Eastern Studies with the CFR.
[00:08:37.795 --> 00:08:40.797]  Al-Qaeda fighters, however, may help improve morale.
[00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:51.184]  The influx of jihadis brings discipline, religious fervor, battle experience from Iraq, funding from Sunni sympathizers in the Gulf, and most importantly, deadly results.
[00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.326]  In short, the FSA needs Al-Qaeda, he adds.
[00:08:54.786 --> 00:09:02.931]  Now remember, we told you a year and a half ago they were landing Al-Qaeda, and also bringing them in out of Egypt there to the east,
[00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:04.430]  Into Libya.
[00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.234]  Later that was admitted under the Love Bomb Peace Prize President's attacks there.
[00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:10.535]  Now Al-Qaeda's in charge.
[00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:13.198]  Al-Qaeda flags, Al-Qaeda courts, Al-Qaeda government.
[00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:25.629]  Now the 20,000 missiles and the rest of it are being shipped out of Libya, this is in the news, into Syria, blowing up police stations, blowing up malls, killing everybody, and the media's like they're peaceful, loving demonstrators.
[00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:28.872]  Yeah, even The Guardian admits Al-Qaeda is the main force.
[00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:35.937]  But then our media, kind of for the general public, is like, it's not true, we have to invade Syria because Al-Qaeda is there.
[00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:40.821]  And the public's like, listen, traitor, we gotta invade right now, Al-Qaeda's there.
[00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:48.507]  But in the scholarly reports, with little globalist operatives, like to read what's really going on, it's like, of course Al-Qaeda's there, they're very helpful.
[00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:52.891]  In fact, The Guardian last week was like, they bring good morale, they're doing a damn good job!
[00:09:54.642 --> 00:09:57.685]  This is the real Al-Qaeda, the globalists created and trained at U.S.
[00:09:57.765 --> 00:10:01.829]  bases and others against the Russians in the mid-90s, against the Serbs.
[00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:08.115]  They took the boogeyman role against us, and now they're helping take down these countries and murder all the Christians.
[00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:14.061]  And Hillary Clinton is pleased as a fly on you-know-what.
[00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:17.712]  So they are very pleased right now.
[00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:21.675]  And I'm unpatriotic because I say go to hell, Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.756]  Ooh, just got on an FBI list right there.
[00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:31.520]  But I gotta have the TSA hands down the pants because Al-Qaeda might be hiding in my underwear.
[00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:40.605]  I thought they were hiding when they got flown out in 2001 after playing the decoy as enemies so the globals could take over the opium in Afghanistan.
[00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.147]  When they got flown into Pakistan, it started destabilizing them.
[00:10:45.236 --> 00:10:48.998]  But I'm sorry, they're not hiding at CIA bases, they're hiding in my pants.
[00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.099]  And they're hiding in your pants.
[00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:56.723]  And don't worry, they got convicted pedophiles that are going to abuse your family at the airport to make sure they're not in there.
[00:10:57.063 --> 00:10:59.484]  Now they take your kids behind closed doors at the airport.
[00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:01.546]  And they're setting up highway checkpoints.
[00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:05.368]  Because we all know your wife's got Al-Qaeda right in the shirt.
[00:11:06.108 --> 00:11:08.952]  Right in the cleavage, right there.
[00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:15.339]  And there's a big ol' fat pedo, big ol' pervo gonna have their way with her, don't you worry slaves.
[00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:18.923]  By the way, Gerald Cilente's coming up, as I mentioned earlier.
[00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:20.805]  Oh, speaking of the TV,
[00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:21.465]  TSA.
[00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:25.607]  Doctors advising pregnant women to avoid TSA body scanners.
[00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:30.450]  Really, all these top scientists have come out, and they're all admitting it's causing cancer.
[00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.531]  I mean, it shoots through your body.
[00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:35.012]  Yeah, but cell phones are good for it, even though brain tumors are exploding, everything's fine.
[00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:36.633]  Now, this is much stronger than that.
[00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:47.039]  An article in the New York Times, Health and Science section today, carries several revealing details, including indicating that doctors and scientists are extremely aware of TSA full-body backscatter x-ray scanners.
[00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:57.724]  The article details an account of a pregnant Yolanda Martin, a 34-year-old mother and teacher from Green Bay.
[00:11:57.744 --> 00:12:02.387]  It goes, one of the first things my doctor says is don't go through one of those machines.
[00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.588]  They have not been any long-term studies.
[00:12:04.968 --> 00:12:06.529]  I would prefer you stay away from it.
[00:12:06.689 --> 00:12:16.034]  Well, doctors used to say pregnant women shouldn't take vaccines because it was known to cause miscarriages, but Gloria Steinem says she had an abortion and it's cool.
[00:12:16.772 --> 00:12:20.735]  There ain't nothing cooler than going to a doctor's office and throwing your baby in a blender.
[00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:24.118]  So get with the program, mothers, and get in there.
[00:12:24.738 --> 00:12:30.843]  All the big liberals that are anti-human, like George Monbiot, have come out and said radiation's good for your body.
[00:12:31.143 --> 00:12:32.044]  So is Ann Coulter.
[00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.685]  So get with the program.
[00:12:34.944 --> 00:12:45.472]  John Seedet, emeritus professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco, believes that the effective dose could be 45 times as high as the TSA has estimated.
[00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.355]  Equivalent to about 10% of a chest x-ray.
[00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.976]  Well, so what?
[00:12:51.277 --> 00:12:55.380]  I mean, they tell the little TSA folks it isn't bad for them, it must be true.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.662]  I mean, a government that secretly killed thousands of U.S.
[00:12:58.702 --> 00:13:09.990]  troops in chemical, biological, and radiological tests that's been declassified, and killed lots of foster kids, and shot people up with live polio vaccine, and shot people up with live syphilis, I mean...
[00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:15.541]  I mean, they wouldn't fund Al-Qaeda, I mean, even though they are.
[00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.223]  I mean, they wouldn't stage terror, even though they admit they have.
[00:13:18.523 --> 00:13:19.964]  I mean, they wouldn't hurt you.
[00:13:20.064 --> 00:13:21.205]  These are good people.
[00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:25.049]  Man, I tell you what, I tell you what.
[00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:30.173]  There ain't nothing better than a good, old-fashioned radiation for a baby, alright?
[00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:37.759]  Even though fast-growing cells can be up to 100 times more susceptible to mutations while being hit by these different rays.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.182]  I mean, look what it did for the Fantastic Four.
[00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:50.750]  Maybe they'll get some... My buddy was telling me about some movie, I forget the name, where a guy goes and wallows in all this toxic waste, thinking he's gonna get all these superpowers.
[00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:54.655]  And about a month later, his hairs fall out, and they go, you got leukemia, you're gonna die.
[00:13:55.516 --> 00:13:56.917]  But hey, not that baby, though!
[00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:58.879]  It's gonna be Ben Grimm!
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.142]  It's clobberin' time!
[00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:07.465]  Maybe Ben Grimm can like, you know, say, get back here in the secret rape room.
[00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:09.807]  I'm gonna crush your testicles with my power.
[00:14:10.348 --> 00:14:11.609]  Yes, I'm Ben Grimm.
[00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:14.971]  All right, let's continue here in the fantasy land.
[00:14:15.492 --> 00:14:16.653]  Quote of the day.
[00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:21.617]  This is by the Miami Dade Clerk of Courts, Harvey Reuven.
[00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:33.240]  Of UNICEF, part of the UN, Rio, Plustin Summit, Johannesburg, the American system of justice must be changed to conform to that of the rest of the world.
[00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:41.728]  And there must be a shift in attitudes, individual wants, needs and desires are to be conformed to the views and dictates of government planners.
[00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:48.652]  In the process of implementing sustainable development, that means serfdom, individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:53.174]  The collective of government control freaks, parasites, and planners, I would add.
[00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:54.314]  So there you go.
[00:14:54.555 --> 00:15:02.638]  And they've brought in all these minions that love UN, love world government, love tyranny, into all the major positions of power.
[00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:04.379]  And we are in deep trouble.
[00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:10.502]  We're going to go to break and come back with Gerald Cilente, but first I want to announce something very exciting.
[00:15:11.883 --> 00:15:22.290]  If you go to InfoWars.com and scroll about a third of the way down on the right-hand side, you will notice the link there to put your email address in to the InfoWars Insider.

[00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:01.215]  That's also the direct URL.
[00:16:01.275 --> 00:16:04.696]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter forward slash.
[00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:06.316]  Did it have the other forward slash?
[00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:07.877]  I'm always plugging on air.
[00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:10.498]  It's InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:12.158]  Does it work?
[00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:16.159]  Oh, the other forward slash happens automatically.
[00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:16.379]  Good.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.540]  So there you go.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.001]  Go there.

[00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:55.463]  It's exploding.
[00:16:55.843 --> 00:17:01.207]  PlanetInfoWars.com, the social network to meet like-minded people, to get involved.
[00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:08.739]  Whether it's business ideas, or dating, or hunting, or camping, or news, or poetry, it's all there at PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:15.189]  We'll be back with a big interview, I got a bunch of questions for him, with Top Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente.
[00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.171]  Please stay with us.
[00:17:40.638 --> 00:17:43.359]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:17:43.659 --> 00:17:48.501]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:55.884]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:17:56.024 --> 00:18:01.429]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:05.412]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:19:02.974 --> 00:19:04.414]  There's no priming required.
[00:19:04.675 --> 00:19:06.716]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:09.457]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:11.878]  Easy to set up and use.

[00:19:13.499 --> 00:19:16.379]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:19:16.699 --> 00:19:19.880]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

[00:19:46.317 --> 00:19:50.779]  And we are back on this August 7, 2012, Tuesday edition.
[00:19:50.839 --> 00:20:07.287]  It's InfoWars Nightly News, and we are joined by your favorite guest out there, and my favorite guest, or at least one of the great guests we have on that I always enjoy having on because of his wit and his insight and his forecasting, Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Institute.
[00:20:07.587 --> 00:20:11.929]  And they've just had their new magazine go out to subscribers.
[00:20:12.329 --> 00:20:15.671]  We're going to break down his take on the LIBOR scandal, on
[00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:21.273]  HSBC and Al-Qaeda, narcotics trafficking, with Wells Fargo, it is getting crazy.
[00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:26.055]  The new issue, you gotta love Anthony Frida, what an amazing graphics guy.
[00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:28.496]  I'm a little envious of the fact that he's got Anthony Frida.
[00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:33.878]  With Jesus beating the money changers, the modern money changers, with the cat-or-nine-tail.
[00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:35.339]  So that's coming up.
[00:20:35.439 --> 00:20:41.823]  But first, I'm going to throw a wild card at Gerald, something I love doing, because he can always cover any issue.
[00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:58.315]  Gerald, what do you make of these shootings magically happening when all these gun bills are introduced, with Army PSYOP guys conveniently dying, and some drugged-up guy dressed up like Ronald McDonald, they say, as the Joker, and just all the conflicting reports.
[00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:01.978]  What do you make of these shootings taking place right now?
[00:21:02.822 --> 00:21:06.224]  I mean, why are they any different than sending, you know, this is Terror Tuesday.
[00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:11.889]  Who are we going to pick today to send a drone over in some foreign country and blow away?
[00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:15.491]  I mean, it's just another day of business in the USA.
[00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:17.973]  You know, the fish rots from the head down.
[00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:20.294]  You know, I was thinking about this as well.
[00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:26.136]  Suppose this Batman cat, you know, what if his name was Muhammad?
[00:21:26.616 --> 00:21:30.917]  Boy, oh boy, would they be wiping out the Arabs now!
[00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:33.217]  It would be bombs away!
[00:21:33.237 --> 00:21:45.500]  And if this other guy, Wade, uh, Page, you know, if he blew up a, went into a synagogue and did this, could you imagine what would be going on?
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:55.888]  So what this is, Alex, it's you got two crazy guys in a crazy world of a country of 312 million people.
[00:21:56.308 --> 00:22:00.011]  They're whacked out on prescription drugs.
[00:22:00.392 --> 00:22:03.394]  They're shooting little kids up with Ritalin.
[00:22:03.754 --> 00:22:05.656]  They're giving little kids, I mean,
[00:22:06.096 --> 00:22:08.417]  Antidepressants at six years old!
[00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:11.798]  You don't even know what it is to be depressed at six years old!
[00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:14.460]  So the whole culture is rotting out.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.881]  But again, put this into perspective.
[00:22:17.301 --> 00:22:28.305]  Could you imagine what the headlines would read if this guy went into a synagogue rather than into a Sikh temple and blew away six people?
[00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:32.287]  Or this other Batman freak, his name was Muhammad.
[00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:34.388]  It would be a whole different story.
[00:22:35.248 --> 00:22:40.870]  So what I'm saying is, you're also seeing all of this crap for gun control.
[00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.230]  Gun control?
[00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:50.233]  How about a little gun control for the United States that's intervening in countries around the world?
[00:22:50.673 --> 00:22:54.274]  I mean, really, if you're gonna- Again, Happy Terror Tuesday!
[00:22:54.294 --> 00:22:57.015]  Who are we gonna pick out to blow away today?
[00:22:59.031 --> 00:23:13.140]  It's so frustrating to see the Pentagon, in some cases, where they'll kill up to 200 people bombing some wedding to get one bad guy, no judge, no jury, no court, illegally in some country that doesn't want the drones there, violating national and international law.
[00:23:13.761 --> 00:23:19.004]  You've got these unaccountable autonomous robot aircraft, in some cases, without human operators.
[00:23:19.505 --> 00:23:20.485]  All of this is happening.
[00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:22.767]  It's like, oh, collateral damage.
[00:23:22.807 --> 00:23:26.910]  They call it bug splats in the Pentagon parlance, collateral damage.
[00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:31.193]  You know, people get killed in a theater.
[00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:32.955]  Oh, it's horrible!
[00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.756]  Oh, we gotta take your guns!
[00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:35.657]  We're so sad!
[00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:36.458]  It's so sad!
[00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:36.978]  No, no, no, no.
[00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:43.725]  This is such a sick system that they've sold, and the whole thing is very, very suspicious to me.
[00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:50.491]  Now, I want to get into what's happening in the Middle East, and then the economy, and the latest, the Trends Journal, but let's get into that right now.
[00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:52.734]  You talked about it a year ago.
[00:23:53.174 --> 00:24:06.233]  We talked about it when it was happening over a year ago in Libya, where the West, out of Egypt, but also landing them there in Tripoli, brought in tens of thousands of real Al-Qaeda jihadis out of Saudi Arabia, lining up the blacks, shooting them.
[00:24:07.073 --> 00:24:10.475]  Overthrowing Gaddafi, who had become a stabilizing force and worked with the West.
[00:24:10.855 --> 00:24:11.876]  Look at the message that sends.
[00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:15.277]  Overthrowing their own puppet, Mubarak, putting in something worse.
[00:24:16.298 --> 00:24:22.041]  Now in Syria, openly admitting, the news is like, yeah, we're using Al-Qaeda there.
[00:24:22.682 --> 00:24:23.622]  They're tough fighters.
[00:24:24.022 --> 00:24:34.326]  I thought I needed TSA to molest my wife, and to molest me, because Al Qaeda might be in my Calvin Klein underwear, Gerald.
[00:24:34.386 --> 00:24:43.749]  I mean, I thought they could be hiding anywhere, but now they're saying that they're good guys going after Assad, who didn't do anything to anybody, and wasn't threatening our country?
[00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:45.530]  I mean, am I unpatriotic?
[00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.910]  Let me ask you this.
[00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.531]  Are you ready to say you love Al Qaeda and be patriotic?
[00:24:50.851 --> 00:24:57.336]  You know, you really nailed it, Big, by beginning it with Libya, and how the whole area is now destabilized.
[00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:59.778]  That wonderful humanitarian mission.
[00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:02.541]  Now Western Africa's all up for grabs.
[00:25:02.981 --> 00:25:04.042]  And you said it.
[00:25:04.442 --> 00:25:05.703]  It's the al-Qaeda group.
[00:25:06.164 --> 00:25:10.327]  And it's the same, and then you want to really know about some hypocrisy?
[00:25:10.928 --> 00:25:14.591]  Who's supplying most of the arms to Syria?
[00:25:15.271 --> 00:25:17.392]  Oh, those wonderful democracies.
[00:25:17.752 --> 00:25:22.273]  Oh, you know, the place where women have just the joyous time of their life.
[00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:26.134]  The dictatorships of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[00:25:26.534 --> 00:25:27.214]  That's right.
[00:25:27.874 --> 00:25:30.215]  They're the ones that are selling democracy.
[00:25:30.255 --> 00:25:31.615]  What am I, six years old?
[00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:33.656]  Who's going to believe this baloney?
[00:25:34.036 --> 00:25:37.037]  They're the ones that are destabilizing the region.
[00:25:37.757 --> 00:25:41.739]  And the reason they're destabilizing Syria is very simple.
[00:25:42.199 --> 00:25:50.043]  It's what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, as you pointed out, wrote about over a year ago in the Trends Journal for two reasons.
[00:25:50.524 --> 00:25:54.646]  It's the only place where the Russians have a port in the Mediterranean.
[00:25:55.146 --> 00:26:04.151]  And number two, the Syrians are the only ones that are supporting the Palestinians and the Hezbollah in Lebanon.
[00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:07.493]  And it's also the Iranian connection.
[00:26:07.893 --> 00:26:11.496]  And this is really about bringing down Iran.
[00:26:12.136 --> 00:26:14.137]  So let's not lose sight of this.
[00:26:14.938 --> 00:26:23.283]  And then if you want to hear some more hypocrisy, I'm watching the Cartoon News Network, or better known as CNN,
[00:26:24.264 --> 00:26:34.909]  And this guy's reporting from some northern city in Syria, and he's saying, I can assure you, there are no al-Qaeda in these people that I'm speaking with.
[00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:53.719]  And then I read the Israeli newspaper, ah, that's the same day, and they're saying, now Israel is looking to become involved in Syria because they're afraid that al-Qaeda is going to be crossing over into Syria, from Syria, into Israel,
[00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:58.420]  Oh, and then it also is another excuse to bomb Iran.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:15.545]  So what you have here, Alex, in simple language, is a bunch of psychopaths called our State Department, our military, our presidents, our secretaries of this and that, that are leading the nation to destruction.
[00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:20.046]  Not only Syria, not only the Middle East,
[00:27:20.546 --> 00:27:42.799]  But the United States, because if we go to war against Iran, I've said this before, it's the beginning of World War III, right now the entire Middle East is destabilized, and people are forgetting this, that when Israel invaded Lebanon the last time,
[00:27:43.988 --> 00:27:44.708]  They lost.
[00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:46.249]  They lost big.
[00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:52.834]  And they lost because Syria, through Iran, was giving Hezbollah weapons.
[00:27:53.474 --> 00:27:55.375]  And they don't want any part of that.
[00:27:55.696 --> 00:28:00.439]  So this is a Middle East war that is going to be spreading over the borders.
[00:28:01.912 --> 00:28:17.361]  And now we segue into the Trends Journal and your forecast in the latest issue in the Libor scandal, but the caveat here is, as you said over a year and a half ago, the first great war of the 21st century, get ready for it.
[00:28:17.801 --> 00:28:25.506]  All the preparations for martial law in Europe, all the preparations now admitted here, Secretary of the Army saying we want troops in every U.S.
[00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:29.348]  city, a new article went up at Infowars.com tonight,
[00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:38.775]  Public army documents, this is public, saying they're preparing to use the military against the Tea Party and saying we're going to link up with Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:39.155 --> 00:28:40.376]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:28:40.396 --> 00:28:46.998]  I mean, are they going to show up at my house and want to have sex with my wife, Homeland Security, because Al-Qaeda will get me if they don't?
[00:28:47.478 --> 00:28:50.598]  I mean, do they want my bank account because Al-Qaeda might be hiding in it?
[00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:56.000]  I mean, this is like the can opener for any job that it's Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.844]  When they used them against the Serbs, the Russians, Libya, Leningradian confirms they've shipped them in.
[00:29:03.184 --> 00:29:08.467]  They're the main force leading everything in Syria is Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:08.487 --> 00:29:09.948]  They dominate the resistance.
[00:29:09.988 --> 00:29:10.829]  That's the headline.
[00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:12.810]  They wear Al-Qaeda uniforms.
[00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.231]  They fly Al-Qaeda flags.
[00:29:14.531 --> 00:29:16.932]  Their flags are over the courthouses in Libya.
[00:29:17.392 --> 00:29:19.794]  I mean, this is all public
[00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.548]  Information and the bankers are gearing up for insurrection.
[00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:35.316]  The only way I see them getting away with this, Gerald, is starting a war thinking we'll rally around the flag if we're in a regional war that expands into Iran.
[00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.178]  The Russians have said they're going to back Syria.
[00:29:37.418 --> 00:29:40.340]  The Iranians said today they'll do whatever it takes
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:46.389]  So this really does look like it's shaping up towards a third world war.
[00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.933]  The first great war of the 21st century.
[00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:51.116]  Is there any way to avoid this?
[00:29:51.477 --> 00:29:55.844]  Because the bankers want this political diversion.
[00:29:57.222 --> 00:30:01.868]  I don't see any way of averting it unless the people rise up and come out against it.
[00:30:02.209 --> 00:30:02.890]  But they're not.
[00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:06.054]  They're still buying into the baloney.
[00:30:06.855 --> 00:30:11.561]  And you really rounded it all up with hitting the areas around the globe.
[00:30:12.502 --> 00:30:14.904]  The war is already on, Alex.
[00:30:15.304 --> 00:30:16.745]  What's going on in Syria?
[00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:21.629]  I mean, we're talking, you know, people have a vision of, you know, this, you know, desert country.
[00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:23.650]  I mean, these are metropolitan areas.
[00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.612]  You know, this would be like, you know, bombing Houston.
[00:30:26.652 --> 00:30:31.896]  They've got al-Qaeda blowing up police stations, military bases, shopping malls, and admitting it.
[00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:35.839]  And again, let's go back to the beginning of al-Qaeda.
[00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:38.601]  When did it begin and who funded it first?
[00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:43.412]  Wasn't it the Americans trying to get the Russians out of Afghanistan?
[00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:45.952]  That's my recollection of it.
[00:30:46.332 --> 00:30:47.453]  It never stops.
[00:30:47.753 --> 00:30:53.494]  What people need to know are that the military are a bunch of losers.
[00:30:54.234 --> 00:30:58.255]  Everything that they touch, they turn into a disaster.
[00:30:58.675 --> 00:31:00.315]  Let's look at the track record.
[00:31:00.955 --> 00:31:02.475]  They lost the Korean War.
[00:31:02.996 --> 00:31:04.636]  They lost the Vietnam War.
[00:31:05.436 --> 00:31:07.618]  They lost the Iraq War.
[00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:09.079]  They're losing.
[00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:11.201]  They lost the Afghan War.
[00:31:11.982 --> 00:31:15.245]  Now they're shifting and they're moving into the Middle East.
[00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:17.487]  And they're doing it admittedly.
[00:31:18.087 --> 00:31:23.392]  They keep starting new wars after they lose old ones.
[00:31:23.832 --> 00:31:27.735]  People wonder why our economy is going down the toilet.
[00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:35.141]  Couldn't be because of the 1.5 trillion dollars that we're spending in war and war-related expenses.
[00:31:35.161 --> 00:31:39.805]  Couldn't be the 20,000 drones that the Air Force alone has.
[00:31:40.385 --> 00:31:42.267]  In fact, let me interrupt you just to toot your horn.
[00:31:42.607 --> 00:31:53.176]  Occasionally I see comments on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com when we post, you know, one of these PrisonPlanet.tv interviews for everybody, not just PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:57.957]  And I will see the little snipes going, where's the first great war, Gerald?
[00:31:58.217 --> 00:32:00.797]  You wrote that almost two years ago, and you said it.
[00:32:01.538 --> 00:32:13.180]  If they don't call Libya and Syria and all of this bedlam, and all these expanded wars, and all of this a big war, but, but, oh, Obama's a peace president.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.901]  Libya and Syria aren't wars, they're revolutions!
[00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:25.612]  When the US and NATO give them hundreds of thousands of weapons and they're shipping missiles and nerve gas out of Libya to use.
[00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:28.136]  See Gerald, you're wrong.
[00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.037]  This isn't a war.
[00:32:29.498 --> 00:32:32.422]  The little minions out there sniping at you, they're right.
[00:32:32.682 --> 00:32:35.843]  I mean, they're not openly saying they're getting ready to hit Iran in all the news.
[00:32:36.103 --> 00:32:38.844]  Russia isn't threatening to use nuclear missiles in Western Europe.
[00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:40.385]  Everything's fine.
[00:32:40.705 --> 00:32:42.466]  You're a pessimist porn dealer.
[00:32:42.746 --> 00:32:44.947]  By the way, the economy's great, too.
[00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:49.508]  You know, we left the recession three years ago, even though they admit we never did.
[00:32:49.849 --> 00:32:51.869]  Because you're right, you're wrong.
[00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:53.250]  You want to apologize to people?
[00:32:54.309 --> 00:32:56.111]  Yeah, you know, they're trolls.
[00:32:56.231 --> 00:32:57.632]  I know who these people are.
[00:32:58.033 --> 00:33:00.816]  And the other thing, let's move beyond the Middle East.
[00:33:01.236 --> 00:33:07.863]  How about those millions of people that are taking to the streets in Spain virtually every other week?
[00:33:08.683 --> 00:33:09.845]  The indignados.
[00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:16.888]  How about what's going on in Greece, and how that whole society is breaking down?
[00:33:17.508 --> 00:33:20.710]  Crime is skyrocketing across Europe.
[00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.231]  Look at the new numbers that just came out in Italy.
[00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:28.073]  Oh, son of a gun, the unemployment rate over there is...
[00:33:28.613 --> 00:33:29.454]  Shooting around 12%.
[00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:33.236]  That's the official one.
[00:33:33.797 --> 00:33:34.637]  25% in Spain.
[00:33:35.017 --> 00:33:37.499]  And they still call it a recession?
[00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.180]  You know, give me a break.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.002]  Hey, let's keep moving on.
[00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:42.423]  What is it now?
[00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:47.326]  Oh, it's only the fourth month of negative GDP in Italy.
[00:33:47.906 --> 00:33:51.189]  Only down about 1% this last quarter.
[00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:54.171]  Look what's going on in the UK!
[00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:57.514]  You wanna see a bread and circus show?
[00:33:58.014 --> 00:33:59.476]  I got one for ya!
[00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:02.658]  Let's call it the Olympics!
[00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:04.440]  It's beautiful!
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.663]  Your country's going down the crapper!
[00:34:08.083 --> 00:34:10.645]  Hey, God save the Queen!
[00:34:11.206 --> 00:34:14.048]  Take that one, Queenie!
[00:34:14.168 --> 00:34:17.611]  And they've gotta order the military in to fill the unsold seats.
[00:34:17.671 --> 00:34:19.053]  Talk about let them eat cake!
[00:34:19.773 --> 00:34:23.436]  And then you go back and you want to see more bread and circuses?
[00:34:23.957 --> 00:34:27.099]  Go back to the 2004 Olympics.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.421]  Hey, who was it that held it then?
[00:34:30.302 --> 00:34:32.284]  Couldn't have been Greece, could it?
[00:34:33.024 --> 00:34:34.065]  No!
[00:34:34.445 --> 00:34:36.167]  Not the rich Greeks!
[00:34:36.587 --> 00:34:38.129]  The ones that don't have...
[00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.213]  Two drachma to rub together.
[00:34:41.634 --> 00:34:43.978]  You can see it's a whole thing is collapsing.
[00:34:44.118 --> 00:34:45.100]  And that's another point.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:52.451]  What is it, 14 billion the Brits are having to spend just to pay to have an event that people can't even afford to go to?
[00:34:53.263 --> 00:34:59.505]  Not only can they not afford to go to it, it's killing business throughout England.
[00:35:00.406 --> 00:35:02.687]  In London, the businesses are dead.
[00:35:03.207 --> 00:35:09.389]  They're giving huge discounts at the theatre, and you know, the theatre's really a hot place to go to.
[00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:17.532]  So no, no one's making any money off this other than the corporate whores, the ones that always make the dough.
[00:35:17.852 --> 00:35:19.973]  So when you put it all together, oh,
[00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:23.274]  Look right here in the nice old USA.
[00:35:23.715 --> 00:35:27.276]  Oh, look at the little riots that were going on in Anaheim.
[00:35:27.597 --> 00:35:29.498]  Oh, don't pay any attention to that.
[00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:32.679]  Those are just a bunch of disgruntled people.
[00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:42.124]  They're not angry about the $285 million luxury hotel that's going up there in Anaheim.
[00:35:42.504 --> 00:35:45.766]  And they gave the guys tax breaks worth $158 million.
[00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:52.656]  As people don't have food to eat or jobs anywhere.
[00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:55.381]  No, that has nothing to do with it.
[00:35:55.782 --> 00:35:59.530]  Gerald, let me just stop you there for a moment because, again, you've predicted
[00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:05.635]  This rotting of society, as you called it earlier, and that's why I brought up the trolls.
[00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:07.757]  I think a lot of them aren't even trolls.
[00:36:07.877 --> 00:36:09.498]  They're in delusion.
[00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:25.113]  And as more and more of what I've talked about, you've talked about, many other people that have their heads screwed on straight, comes true, you're going to see a lot of people appreciate what we've done, but you're going to see others who've clung to the delusion, kind of like Hitler in the bunker.
[00:36:26.573 --> 00:36:30.255]  Who are going to get very, very angry at those of us that have broken down.
[00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:35.658]  But when you talk about a rotting society, we're starting to rattle off examples of this.
[00:36:35.718 --> 00:36:36.519]  Please continue.
[00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:39.561]  Well, again, every day you pick up the paper.
[00:36:39.881 --> 00:36:46.725]  A guy walks into a hospital, blows his wife's brains out, kills his mother-in-law, boyfriend, three kids.
[00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:52.108]  I mean, I remember when there was a movie, Truman Capote wrote it when I was a young guy.
[00:36:52.128 --> 00:36:55.550]  He wrote the book and they did the movie in cold blood.
[00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.451]  Oh, you thought it was terrible.
[00:36:57.531 --> 00:36:58.231]  Guess what?
[00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:02.733]  Every day is in cold blood in the United States today.
[00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:05.255]  You know, it's just become a fact of life.
[00:37:05.555 --> 00:37:09.377]  How about another flash mob somewhere in a Walmart?
[00:37:09.737 --> 00:37:13.139]  You're watching society crumble in front of us.
[00:37:13.519 --> 00:37:20.062]  The gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United States than any of the industrialized nations.
[00:37:20.723 --> 00:37:24.765]  All of the prestitutes bowing to the Buffetts, bowing to the Gates,
[00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:26.846]  Bowing to the Zuckerbergs.
[00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:30.709]  Oh, and look at the numbers that came out with last week's unemployment.
[00:37:31.169 --> 00:37:32.350]  Great jobs!
[00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.451]  Great jobs are being created!
[00:37:34.871 --> 00:37:41.115]  Nearly 30% of them pay poverty-level wages.
[00:37:41.716 --> 00:37:43.717]  Great jobs are being created!
[00:37:44.037 --> 00:37:45.798]  Great jobs are being created!
[00:37:46.279 --> 00:37:46.839]  Oh yeah!
[00:37:46.899 --> 00:37:48.380]  Lost 750,000 full-time jobs since March.
[00:37:54.344 --> 00:37:55.945]  Hey, don't worry about it.
[00:37:56.285 --> 00:37:58.827]  Why should people earn a living wage?
[00:37:59.167 --> 00:38:00.468]  They're just lazy.
[00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:02.229]  They don't want to work.
[00:38:02.709 --> 00:38:17.979]  Look, it's great moving back home with Mommy and Daddy after you get out of college, and you're $80,000 in debt, and you'll never get a job to pay it off, and you're an indentioned servant.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.201]  Why be angry?
[00:38:20.681 --> 00:38:22.562]  Salute the President!
[00:38:22.782 --> 00:38:23.623]  A salute!
[00:38:23.983 --> 00:38:27.527]  I'll give you a salute, but the people do it!
[00:38:27.928 --> 00:38:31.011]  Look at the Presidential Reality Show!
[00:38:31.431 --> 00:38:33.434]  What are they talking about today?
[00:38:33.874 --> 00:38:38.319]  Obama came up with a new name for Mittens-Romney.
[00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:40.181]  Romneyhood!
[00:38:40.761 --> 00:38:42.263]  Isn't that nice?
[00:38:42.724 --> 00:38:43.765]  Oh, it's perfect!
[00:38:45.196 --> 00:38:47.338]  For the Presidential Reality Show.
[00:38:47.438 --> 00:38:53.104]  I want to get to that, but first I want to go to the New Trends Journal, the LIBOR scandal, the real reason we got you here, Gerald.
[00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.346]  I could talk to you for hours, I know you've got to go soon.
[00:38:57.008 --> 00:39:04.436]  Continuing here, talking about the rotting of society, looking at other cultures, looking at history, looking at the current trend.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.441]  We do see crime exploding.
[00:39:06.481 --> 00:39:07.742]  We see fraud exploding.
[00:39:08.022 --> 00:39:10.203]  We see arrogance and crime by government.
[00:39:10.664 --> 00:39:17.028]  And just the seizure of property and forcibly inoculating children nationwide without parental consent.
[00:39:17.808 --> 00:39:21.451]  Government making school kids have abortions without telling their parents.
[00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:23.492]  Just rampant crime.
[00:39:24.273 --> 00:39:27.134]  Police shooting people in handcuffs and not getting in trouble.
[00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:29.156]  I mean really craziness
[00:39:30.296 --> 00:39:31.597]  And I'm not just picking on the police.
[00:39:31.917 --> 00:39:34.999]  It's in the general culture, this degeneration.
[00:39:35.559 --> 00:39:41.262]  But it's also a degeneration in the culture, in the media, in the family.
[00:39:41.682 --> 00:39:48.966]  The system has done this by design, knowing that if they bring in the immoral virus that people will stand down.
[00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:58.831]  So it's almost a rudderless society having its prosperity taken as the establishment builds up this military force internally against us.
[00:39:59.172 --> 00:40:00.232]  They know what's coming.
[00:40:00.312 --> 00:40:01.633]  They know you're right, Gerald.
[00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:05.875]  They know that they've engineered this.
[00:40:05.935 --> 00:40:10.458]  So tell us, where do you see it going right now if we don't turn things around?
[00:40:10.698 --> 00:40:14.000]  And then I want to get into the latest Trends Journal, Libor and more.
[00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.272]  Well, where is it taking us?
[00:40:16.292 --> 00:40:20.796]  The National Defense Authorization Act that Obama signed on New Year's Eve.
[00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:21.777]  Where is it taking us?
[00:40:22.506 --> 00:40:25.529]  How about all the executive orders that Obama's signed?
[00:40:25.729 --> 00:40:33.576]  How about the new ruling that it's okay to send drones over people's homes to arrest them?
[00:40:33.596 --> 00:40:35.197]  I mean, where's it going?
[00:40:36.558 --> 00:40:44.825]  They know where it's going, and society's unraveling, and they're doing everything they can to make sure that we don't step out of line.
[00:40:45.586 --> 00:40:46.967]  And that's where it's going.
[00:40:47.607 --> 00:41:04.015]  So when you put all the pieces together, they're going to continue to clamp down on people like you and me and others that are standing up and speaking out, while the rest of the sheep will get all aboard next train to Auschwitz.
[00:41:04.415 --> 00:41:06.196]  You know, kiss those calories goodbye.
[00:41:06.216 --> 00:41:07.177]  You're going to love it there.
[00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:09.198]  So that's where it's going.
[00:41:10.658 --> 00:41:11.779]  What's the time frame on it?
[00:41:13.086 --> 00:41:13.766]  It's now!
[00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:16.068]  It could be tomorrow!
[00:41:16.488 --> 00:41:19.811]  Look, you see all the reports coming out about the false flags?
[00:41:20.151 --> 00:41:26.935]  You see all the reports coming out what they were doing under the Kennedy administration in Santo Domingo?
[00:41:27.816 --> 00:41:33.440]  You know, you see how they were trying to... We've been talking about blowing up the American consulate!
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.520]  To rile the people.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.121]  Yeah, that's been declassified.
[00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:41.841]  You know, we all defend Kennedy because he said no to Operation Northwoods, killing U.S.
[00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:42.442]  citizens.
[00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:45.762]  And then it turns out Robert Kennedy was planning to blow up the U.S.
[00:41:45.802 --> 00:41:49.163]  consulate, what, just in Honduras, to blame his enemies.
[00:41:50.003 --> 00:41:53.384]  Yeah, I mean, so look at the... Doesn't anybody understand?
[00:41:53.404 --> 00:41:55.064]  These are psychopaths.
[00:41:55.524 --> 00:41:56.584]  These are sick people.
[00:41:57.204 --> 00:41:58.845]  They're Robert McNamara's.
[00:41:59.405 --> 00:42:01.005]  They're Donald Rumsfeld's.
[00:42:02.358 --> 00:42:06.780]  Marvel comic books could not have come up with a better creature than Dick Cheney.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.601]  And people believe them?
[00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:13.023]  How could any self-respecting person follow these people?
[00:42:13.383 --> 00:42:14.703]  They're destroying us.
[00:42:15.023 --> 00:42:17.084]  They're destroying our nation.
[00:42:17.484 --> 00:42:19.285]  And no one seems to care.
[00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:24.307]  And when you talked about the destruction of society, look what they've elevated.
[00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:33.552]  I don't want to go into detail because I don't want to embarrass the person, but it was a government person that I had a meeting with.
[00:42:34.212 --> 00:42:43.778]  And it was about, I want to say, let's raise the role model so that the young people can have a higher role model to follow.
[00:42:44.278 --> 00:42:52.904]  So we had discussions and she looks at me and I go on and I said, you know, when you think about what they've done with Gangster Rap,
[00:42:53.684 --> 00:42:54.946]  I said, figure it out.
[00:42:55.447 --> 00:43:07.863]  They elevated the lowest level of society, the lowest, the most violent of criminals, that they wouldn't give shoelaces to or belts because they'd kill you with them.
[00:43:08.905 --> 00:43:13.087]  So she goes, now you have to respect that culture.
[00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:16.468]  It's not, I don't have to respect that culture.
[00:43:16.728 --> 00:43:17.969]  You don't sell that.
[00:43:18.409 --> 00:43:20.470]  Then she really put me over the top.
[00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:26.653]  She said, well, you know, even the mafia, as bad as it seems, there are good elements.
[00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:29.136]  I see you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:43:29.156 --> 00:43:31.379]  There's nothing good about the mafia.
[00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:34.203]  There's nothing good about gangster rap.
[00:43:34.784 --> 00:43:42.054]  And now I want to bring this all together because you were talking about how at all levels of society it's rotting.
[00:43:43.143 --> 00:43:54.934]  If I was a guy that still was living in the Bronx, and I had a different mentality, and I wanted to pull off a dirty deal, and I'm saying, here, this is what we're going to do.
[00:43:55.014 --> 00:44:00.819]  And all of a sudden, Joey says, hey, Gerald, come on, man, that's not right.
[00:44:00.859 --> 00:44:02.781]  You know, we're going to screw this one and that one.
[00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:05.103]  I'd look at Joey, you know what I'd say?
[00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:06.844]  What are you, a jerk?
[00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:10.146]  The banks are screwing us!
[00:44:10.826 --> 00:44:17.309]  The government got your brother killed for fighting a stupid war!
[00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:24.972]  You don't have two nickels to rub together because they're screwing us and you want to play it straight?
[00:44:26.072 --> 00:44:27.793]  That's what's going on.
[00:44:28.313 --> 00:44:34.756]  Everybody is ripping off the system because they're ripping it off from the top.
[00:44:35.236 --> 00:44:42.080]  Our role models are Bush, are Clinton, are Obama.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:56.095]  Are sleaze, are mass murderers, are psychopaths, and people are paying $35,000 a head to have dinner with them.
[00:44:56.636 --> 00:45:02.923]  So yeah, society's rotting, because look at the rot at the top.
[00:45:05.134 --> 00:45:08.517]  But at the same time, there is a big awakening happening.
[00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:11.199]  Give us your take on that, and then I want to get into the economics.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.224]  The big awakening, and you know, this is something we're going to be writing about more.
[00:45:16.784 --> 00:45:20.167]  We're forecasting, Alex, a new new age.
[00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:26.854]  The New Age began with a lot of good intentions back in the late 70s, 80s.
[00:45:27.034 --> 00:45:32.559]  It was gaining momentum in the 90s until the internet boom happened.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.824]  People started making a lot of fake money and then people started...
[00:45:37.344 --> 00:45:39.885]  You know, shopping until they could drop.
[00:45:40.205 --> 00:45:41.225]  What a mentality!
[00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:50.307]  So, now we're being forced into an involuntary, voluntary simplicity, where you're looking at what's really important in life.
[00:45:50.887 --> 00:45:57.448]  Friendship, love, companionship, doing kind things to each other, living by the golden rule.
[00:45:58.028 --> 00:46:01.129]  We're going to see a revival in religion.
[00:46:01.769 --> 00:46:06.590]  Not the standard religions, but we're forecasting something new.
[00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:17.657]  I don't want to call it spirituality or even New Age because that puts labels on them that really, you know, makes them, kind of pigeonholes them.
[00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:19.819]  But something greater than that.
[00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:22.981]  You're saying people are going to, are starting to awaken spiritually.
[00:46:23.021 --> 00:46:24.542]  That always happens during a crisis.
[00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:25.803]  Exactly.
[00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:29.724]  And there are a lot of wonderful people in this country.
[00:46:30.124 --> 00:46:37.387]  And if I were to add them up, I would add up there are more great people in this country than slimers.
[00:46:38.047 --> 00:46:41.188]  It's only that the slimers do the dirty deals.
[00:46:41.588 --> 00:46:49.371]  The slimers are your senators, your congressmen, the gang of 535 that run the country.
[00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:51.352]  Look what they're talking about!
[00:46:52.052 --> 00:46:54.714]  Reid's calling this guy a liar.
[00:46:55.214 --> 00:46:58.956]  Lindsey to Graham Cracker's calling Reid a liar.
[00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.498]  Who could believe either of them?
[00:47:02.038 --> 00:47:04.800]  You know, it's Disney World for adults.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.382]  So what we're saying is that's only a small part of society.
[00:47:09.802 --> 00:47:17.787]  When things start breaking down, you start seeing a build-up spirituality, and I believe that's the only thing that could save us.
[00:47:18.147 --> 00:47:19.408]  The only thing.
[00:47:19.708 --> 00:47:20.789]  I've said this before.
[00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:25.902]  Here's that wonderful Hindu saying, when the student's ready, the teacher appears.
[00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:29.093]  Anybody that's studied it anything knows what I'm talking about.
[00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:35.519]  You're right, and as the New Trends Journal says, and we say something similar, you are the answer, you are the resistance.
[00:47:36.059 --> 00:47:44.967]  These churches want to control you and make you, you know, feel like you need them, and most of them are 501c3, and we've proven are getting direct homeland security orders.
[00:47:45.427 --> 00:47:50.632]  I've gone and spot-checked local churches, and I mean, it's, you're gonna worship the government, you're gonna do what they say.
[00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:51.733]  I mean, this is like,
[00:47:52.413 --> 00:47:52.994]  We're good.
[00:48:10.658 --> 00:48:11.379]  In their closet.
[00:48:11.919 --> 00:48:15.702]  And people are going to find out that the materialism is not going to empower them.
[00:48:16.102 --> 00:48:20.125]  In the hierarchy of needs, sure, you need to be taken care of, you need to be comfortable.
[00:48:21.586 --> 00:48:24.028]  But that's not the final equation.
[00:48:24.108 --> 00:48:25.389]  You don't sell out.
[00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:27.921]  For status and baubles.
[00:48:28.002 --> 00:48:29.082]  Those don't fulfill you.
[00:48:29.362 --> 00:48:39.746]  That's why the globalists want to keep you so poor you can't even get the basics that you've got to have so they can control good people by making you do bad things for the chicken feed they give you.
[00:48:39.946 --> 00:48:41.907]  That's why they want a post-industrial world.
[00:48:42.107 --> 00:48:45.728]  That's why they want people to not have quality that you talk about.
[00:48:45.788 --> 00:48:49.509]  We have sold our souls for this plastic Walmart death pit.
[00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:51.410]  Now, let's look at the New Trends Journal.
[00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:56.773]  You're breaking down what's happening with LIBOR, what's happening with the economy, what's happening with the global meltdown.
[00:48:57.233 --> 00:49:00.955]  We're seeing about the banks siphoning off money, the stock market being rigged.
[00:49:01.255 --> 00:49:03.777]  It seems like, Gerald, everything's now coming out.
[00:49:04.357 --> 00:49:09.520]  HSBC financing Al-Qaeda, big banks financing the drug lords, owning the aircraft.
[00:49:10.487 --> 00:49:12.750]  It's all coming out now.
[00:49:13.271 --> 00:49:14.653]  Break it down for us.
[00:49:15.034 --> 00:49:15.775]  Go over it.
[00:49:15.975 --> 00:49:17.357]  Because, I mean, what does this mean?
[00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:19.940]  Everything we've talked about has come out, and more!
[00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.664]  Just manifest criminality in our faces.
[00:49:23.683 --> 00:49:28.344]  The Libor scandal should be the biggest story of the 21st century.
[00:49:28.804 --> 00:49:30.385]  They rigged the interest rates.
[00:49:30.945 --> 00:49:39.827]  All those interest rates that you're paying on your mortgage, your car loan, your credit cards, your student loans, they're all rigged.
[00:49:40.588 --> 00:49:44.589]  And they rig them knowing where they're going to go so they could place bets on it.
[00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:46.589]  So they made fortunes on this.
[00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:52.331]  So what was the penalty for, for example, Barclays, the first one caught in it?
[00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:54.680]  Nothing.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.561]  They got a $400 million fine.
[00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:59.182]  I think that was like five days worth of profits.
[00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:03.004]  And what happened to the guy, Robert Diamond?
[00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:05.386]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:50:05.446 --> 00:50:06.246]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:06.866]  I'll quit.
[00:50:06.926 --> 00:50:11.329]  I'll go away with my $100 million and I won't do dirty business anymore.
[00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:13.232]  Nobody's head rolls.
[00:50:13.332 --> 00:50:17.134]  And now we're finding out all the banks that are involved in this.
[00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:18.936]  No heads roll.
[00:50:19.456 --> 00:50:29.302]  The point being is that then we just saw this night fiasco last week, when their system went amok.
[00:50:30.243 --> 00:50:36.207]  The point being is that all of this trading that's going on on Wall Street,
[00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.841]  Is just nothing more than gambling.
[00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.502]  This high frequency trading.
[00:50:41.882 --> 00:50:46.485]  It's estimated between 60 and 80 percent is done by computers.
[00:50:47.045 --> 00:50:48.406]  This isn't investing.
[00:50:48.906 --> 00:50:50.567]  The whole game is rigged.
[00:50:50.687 --> 00:50:51.307]  And guess what?
[00:50:51.728 --> 00:50:52.588]  You're not in it.
[00:50:52.868 --> 00:50:53.949]  You will never be in it.
[00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:56.369]  Only a small number of people are in it.
[00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.890]  Why do you think guys like Romney?
[00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.190]  Why do you think guys like Buffett?
[00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:05.591]  Why do you think guys like all of these guys make all of this money?
[00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:08.572]  Because they're in on the inside deal.
[00:51:08.972 --> 00:51:09.952]  End of story.
[00:51:10.092 --> 00:51:10.572]  Period.
[00:51:10.672 --> 00:51:11.392]  Paragraph.
[00:51:11.733 --> 00:51:13.213]  The whole game is rigged.
[00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:18.854]  And as you pointed out, they're laundering drug money.
[00:51:19.394 --> 00:51:20.894]  What a surprise!
[00:51:21.254 --> 00:51:23.415]  Gee, I never would have known that!
[00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:26.630]  Yeah, I had no idea!
[00:51:27.131 --> 00:51:36.395]  Couldn't be because that's why they wanted to open up all these branches throughout South America, and why all the money was flowing into Miami.
[00:51:36.856 --> 00:51:38.917]  Jeez, blow me over!
[00:51:38.937 --> 00:51:40.578]  Oh, and nope.
[00:51:41.278 --> 00:51:48.468]  Isn't it something that there are no government agencies watching this and they were caught off guard?
[00:51:48.908 --> 00:51:50.450]  It's one criminal operation.
[00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:51.572]  Oh, but don't worry!
[00:51:51.632 --> 00:51:56.137]  They're giving vandalism charges to children and parents who on their own
[00:51:56.958 --> 00:52:03.619]  You know, driveway to the sidewalk, draw little suns and trees and birdies like my kids do.
[00:52:03.959 --> 00:52:06.420]  The policemen come and arrest mommy now.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.181]  And don't you try to sell lemonade, you American scum slave.
[00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:16.862]  You go buy a high fructose corn syrup knockoff at McDonald's or we're going to arrest your butt too.
[00:52:17.242 --> 00:52:22.063]  I mean, they're now giving million dollar fines to garage sales.
[00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:22.843]  I mean,
[00:52:23.943 --> 00:52:31.551]  Every day now I see articles where they're not letting people have gardens in their backyards because you don't have a garden prisoner.
[00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:34.214]  I mean this government is a bunch of lunatics!
[00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:36.135]  That's what I was saying.
[00:52:36.616 --> 00:52:41.200]  And so what are you and I and others that you have on your show trying to do?
[00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:44.324]  We're for terrible things and they should watch us.
[00:52:44.924 --> 00:52:46.306]  We don't want to kill anybody.
[00:52:47.116 --> 00:52:49.336]  We don't want to go in other countries and kill them.
[00:52:49.797 --> 00:52:51.697]  That doesn't mean I'm a pacifist.
[00:52:52.677 --> 00:52:53.937]  I'll protect myself.
[00:52:54.097 --> 00:52:55.638]  I practice close combat.
[00:52:55.678 --> 00:52:56.998]  That's a totally different thing.
[00:52:57.298 --> 00:52:59.679]  But I won't go kill an innocent person.
[00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:02.899]  I won't go into another... Oh, what's wrong with you?
[00:53:02.939 --> 00:53:04.340]  How come you don't want to do that?
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.160]  What else don't we like to do?
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.061]  Well, you and I, we want... People want to drink raw milk.
[00:53:10.081 --> 00:53:11.241]  Hey, that's your business.
[00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:15.002]  Oh no, that's not good for agribusiness.
[00:53:15.062 --> 00:53:18.683]  You've got to get rid of Solenti and Jones over there.
[00:53:18.703 --> 00:53:20.164]  These guys are troublemakers.
[00:53:20.584 --> 00:53:21.604]  Organic food?
[00:53:22.105 --> 00:53:24.966]  Those GMO foods, they're all good for you.
[00:53:24.986 --> 00:53:27.687]  Hey, how about, what's that new study coming out?
[00:53:28.067 --> 00:53:31.468]  That flavored buttercrap blows your brains out?
[00:53:32.068 --> 00:53:34.529]  Hey, that flavored buttercrap is good for you.
[00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:41.513]  Oh no, the corn that 87% of people are eating sterilizes the guinea pigs.
[00:53:41.673 --> 00:53:43.434]  Oh, I'm sure that's an accident too.
[00:53:43.854 --> 00:53:45.175]  Yeah, so we're against that.
[00:53:45.215 --> 00:53:46.896]  That makes us bad people.
[00:53:47.336 --> 00:53:51.178]  Oh, you and I, we're talking about the golden rule, do unto others.
[00:53:51.578 --> 00:53:55.420]  We talk about dignity, respect, and courage, and passion.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.101]  Isn't that terrible?
[00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:58.622]  Can't have any of that.
[00:53:59.062 --> 00:54:01.623]  Not when you have leaders to follow!
[00:54:02.204 --> 00:54:12.368]  How could anybody... Look, I began my career running political campaigns in Westchester County in 1971, the richest county in the United States.
[00:54:12.989 --> 00:54:19.952]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate, and I taught American Politics and Campaign Technology at St.
[00:54:19.992 --> 00:54:20.992]  John's University.
[00:54:21.012 --> 00:54:24.034]  One of the first courses I designed it in the nation.
[00:54:24.654 --> 00:54:35.863]  Never in my life have I seen a presidential reality show like this one, where so few people care about it, and it's as lame as it can be.
[00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:38.045]  What is it all about?
[00:54:38.726 --> 00:54:42.189]  Obama's saying, I want to see Romney's taxes.
[00:54:42.649 --> 00:54:52.857]  Now Trump is coming out, I want to see Obama's grades, or whatever, from grad school, or high school, or kindergarten, whatever that is!
[00:54:54.582 --> 00:55:11.886]  If anybody came out with economic plans, like either of these two clowns, and they would take an Economics 101 in a community college, they would fail, because they're so lame, what both of these candidates are saying.
[00:55:11.926 --> 00:55:20.328]  Well, that's because they're owned by the same people, as you know, so they can't debate on any real issues, because that would expose the whole scam, and like you were saying about the stock market.
[00:55:21.068 --> 00:55:23.551]  It's all done on insider trading now.
[00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:32.041]  That's why they jack it up and bring it down over and over again, holding everybody hostage with their pension funds and 401Ks invested in it.
[00:55:32.882 --> 00:55:35.845]  And then you look at the way the rules have all been written.
[00:55:35.845 --> 00:55:40.847]  When all these billionaires are exempt from the taxes, they get all the tax exemptions.
[00:55:41.327 --> 00:55:43.888]  I've got almost 50 employees here in Austin, Texas.
[00:55:43.928 --> 00:55:44.789]  I don't get jack crap.
[00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.869]  I've checked into it.
[00:55:46.149 --> 00:55:54.373]  I've been laughed at because I'm known as the chump, the sucker, the schmuck, the idiot, the mark, the American piece of trash.
[00:55:55.053 --> 00:56:00.175]  I am seen as nothing but a big blood bag for these mosquitoes to feed off of.
[00:56:01.752 --> 00:56:01.972]  Yeah.
[00:56:02.673 --> 00:56:04.735]  Anybody that works for a living is.
[00:56:05.236 --> 00:56:07.058]  And that's what happened to this country.
[00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:21.993]  Because just like you employ 50 people, there used to be people in this country, they had things called, you know, ladies' men's shops, and, you know, haberdashers, and women's clothing, and they sold trinkets, and this and that.
[00:56:22.714 --> 00:56:23.694]  It's been taken over.
[00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:25.515]  It's been taken over by Walmart.
[00:56:25.775 --> 00:56:27.096]  It's been taken over by Target.
[00:56:27.456 --> 00:56:28.977]  It's been taken over by Macy's.
[00:56:29.297 --> 00:56:33.639]  It's been taken over in the agricultural business by Smithfield, by Tyson, by Cargill.
[00:56:34.566 --> 00:56:35.646]  One after another.
[00:56:36.027 --> 00:56:37.387]  The communications business.
[00:56:37.547 --> 00:56:38.647]  Clear channel.
[00:56:39.087 --> 00:56:40.788]  Ain't nothing clear about that.
[00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:42.168]  It's clear crap.
[00:56:42.469 --> 00:56:44.169]  Controlled by a small group.
[00:56:44.529 --> 00:56:45.409]  Oh, who did that one?
[00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:46.870]  Yeah, it was Bill Clinton, wasn't it?
[00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:47.170]  Yeah.
[00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:48.951]  And you go down the list.
[00:56:49.251 --> 00:56:53.232]  So what they've done, Alex, is they've chipped the entire field
[00:56:54.923 --> 00:56:56.344]  For the benefit of the few.
[00:56:56.804 --> 00:57:01.107]  For the few rich and everybody's become a slave for them.
[00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:02.868]  It's a plantation economy.
[00:57:03.229 --> 00:57:08.452]  It's better than the plantation because in the plantation you had to house them and, you know, they had to feed them.
[00:57:08.952 --> 00:57:09.993]  Now you're on your own.
[00:57:10.433 --> 00:57:12.975]  You have just enough so you can live off the plantation.
[00:57:13.335 --> 00:57:14.896]  We're not responsible for you.
[00:57:14.916 --> 00:57:18.479]  Just make sure you get back here at work in the morning or at night or whenever.
[00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:23.022]  So we have a society where we have what?
[00:57:24.763 --> 00:57:28.607]  58% of the employment participation rate?
[00:57:28.627 --> 00:57:28.607]  58%?
[00:57:28.747 --> 00:57:31.730]  It's an incredibly destructive system.
[00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:33.112]  We're almost out of time.
[00:57:33.132 --> 00:57:36.155]  I know you've got to go to another interview here.
[00:57:36.175 --> 00:57:38.257]  Again, Gerald Cilente joins us.
[00:57:38.297 --> 00:57:40.459]  You can go to his website that's been on screen there.
[00:57:41.139 --> 00:57:46.004]  And you can subscribe, you can get the trends alerts, but also the incredible magazine.
[00:57:46.404 --> 00:57:49.587]  It's all available right there on their website.
[00:57:50.207 --> 00:58:01.457]  But Gerald, in closing, how big is LIBOR, though, to know now that it's all been rigged, everybody's basically a plaintiff, you got ripped off by MF Global.
[00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:08.443]  I think one of our only other hopes is not just the spiritual awakening, people taking action in a new renaissance, but isn't it just that
[00:58:09.183 --> 00:58:13.105]  The controller's craziness may undo them as well?
[00:58:13.626 --> 00:58:14.526]  Yes, it is.
[00:58:14.626 --> 00:58:16.807]  But then again, you see the timeline.
[00:58:17.228 --> 00:58:23.211]  The crash of 29, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[00:58:23.691 --> 00:58:32.316]  The panic of 08, the Great Recession slash Depression, currency wars going on, trade wars heating up, world war is going on.
[00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:36.379]  So when all else is gone, they take us to war.
[00:58:36.699 --> 00:58:38.320]  These are sick people.
[00:58:38.761 --> 00:58:40.242]  That's my concern.
[00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:52.771]  And when you look at the LIBOR and you look at all the scandals going on, again, stay tuned to Europe, because they're going to come out with another scheme to buy the crappy bonds that they can't sell.
[00:58:53.151 --> 00:58:56.054]  It's going to make it look like things are going to be OK again.
[00:58:56.414 --> 00:58:57.094]  It's not.
[00:58:57.675 --> 00:58:58.315]  It's not.
[00:58:58.655 --> 00:59:00.057]  And remember the equation.
[00:59:01.002 --> 00:59:11.966]  Europe and the United States are the two greatest buyers of China, Indonesia, India, all of those slave labor Bangladesh countries.
[00:59:12.566 --> 00:59:22.250]  If the United States and Europe don't consume China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, they don't make.
[00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:24.731]  If they don't make stuff,
[00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:33.815]  Canada, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, they don't export raw materials.
[00:59:34.295 --> 00:59:36.136]  You're looking at the numbers.
[00:59:36.236 --> 00:59:37.677]  I was talking about currency wars.
[00:59:37.717 --> 00:59:39.258]  The rupee is collapsing.
[00:59:39.298 --> 00:59:42.420]  The real in Brazil, one after another.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:47.123]  You look at the data coming out of China and India on GDP.
[00:59:47.523 --> 00:59:48.604]  It's way off.
[00:59:48.744 --> 00:59:50.545]  It's bottom line global depression?
[00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:53.787]  I mean, how long until it's too clear for anybody to ignore?
[00:59:56.158 --> 00:59:58.041]  Some people will never see it!
[00:59:58.462 --> 01:00:02.107]  The fire in the North Tower is under control!
[01:00:02.588 --> 01:00:04.971]  Go back to your offices!
[01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:08.486]  And they went back to their offices.
[01:00:08.546 --> 01:00:11.807]  The system knows exactly what it is doing.
[01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:18.910]  I mean, imagine employers who will have you panic if somebody sees a box in the street and evacuate a building, but fires are in the building.
[01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:21.211]  Go back to your offices.
[01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:22.512]  They wanted a higher death count.
[01:00:22.992 --> 01:00:26.594]  Gerald Salente, I know you've got several web addresses to get to your journal.
[01:00:27.274 --> 01:00:29.195]  What's the best one to go there and subscribe?
[01:00:29.855 --> 01:00:37.938]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, and thank you so much for having me on, Alex, and thank you, thank you for all that you do.
[01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:39.359]  Are you kidding, buddy?
[01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:48.142]  It feels really good knowing there's other people out there that are fighting for liberty, and there's more of us every day, and we're part of the second American revolution against tyranny.
[01:00:48.162 --> 01:00:49.102]  We're gonna win, my friend.
[01:00:49.142 --> 01:00:50.223]  God bless you, Gerald Cilente.
[01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:51.552]  Thank you.
[01:00:52.193 --> 01:00:55.355]  All right, there goes Gerald Cilente, hard-working guy in the fight against tyranny.
[01:00:55.675 --> 01:00:57.496]  Going to do another radio interview right now.
[01:00:57.836 --> 01:01:00.498]  We're definitely going to play some excerpts of this on the radio tomorrow.
[01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:02.359]  Be sure and remind me of that, crew.
[01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:08.263]  Well, that's it for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:01:08.843 --> 01:01:15.468]  I hope that all of you will join us back here tomorrow night, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[01:01:15.848 --> 01:01:20.631]  You can always subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv if you're watching this out
[01:01:21.343 --> 01:01:38.374]  In internet land, for free, that's our goal, but it is the members of PrisonPlanet.TV who get all of the documentary films I've made, my book, Paul Watson's book, expanded extras, nine plus years of research and material.
[01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:44.838]  I've been on air 17, but we've had PrisonPlanet.TV since April of what, 2002?
[01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:52.572]  Yes, so it's over nine years.
[01:01:52.652 --> 01:01:53.894]  I mean, it's like nine and a half years.
[01:01:54.996 --> 01:01:56.518]  I know the ninth anniversary was in April.
[01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:01.185]  So the point is, it's all there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:01.606 --> 01:02:02.828]  And it's 15 cents a day.
[01:02:05.735 --> 01:02:08.657]  5.95 a month, and there's really six memberships for the price of one.
[01:02:08.677 --> 01:02:23.885]  When you pay for one membership, with the username and passcode you create, then you can have your friends and family see the show every night at 7 o'clock, see the archives of it, see it in higher quality, and then we do post it on YouTube, most of it, we do post it
[01:02:24.771 --> 01:02:26.372]  I don't know.
[01:02:42.352 --> 01:02:46.815]  We plan to start having them on the nightly news, doing reports, but also starting new shows.
[01:02:47.115 --> 01:02:49.536]  So it won't just be one show every night here.
[01:02:50.017 --> 01:02:57.621]  We plan, in the face of this depression, in the face of all this tyranny, to just expend every ounce of energy we've got to fight for liberty.
[01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:05.666]  And if it wasn't for you spreading the word about the show, if it wasn't for you subscribing at PrisonPlanet.tv, we could not do this.
[01:03:06.207 --> 01:03:08.128]  So again, thank you so much for all
[01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:10.341]  of your support out there.
[01:03:10.802 --> 01:03:13.702]  I'm Alex Jones for all the great InfoWars team.
[01:03:13.722 --> 01:03:14.903]  We couldn't do it without as well.
[01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:20.564]  Thanking you for your support and again, Lord willing, I'll see you back on the radio 12 noon Eastern tomorrow.
[01:03:20.824 --> 01:03:22.965]  That's streamed at PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[01:03:23.745 --> 01:03:27.506]  And here 7 o'clock tomorrow for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:03:27.866 --> 01:03:30.927]  The future is in our hands if we simply take hold of it.
[01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:36.602]  If we stand back, we let the slimers, as Gerald called them, have control.
[01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:39.063]  So, support what Gerald's doing, support what we're doing.
[01:03:39.703 --> 01:03:42.064]  You buy with your dollars.
[01:03:42.124 --> 01:03:43.565]  You vote with your dollars.
[01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:45.106]  I mean, I use this example all the time.
[01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:49.328]  Ten, fifteen years ago, I've been saying ten years for about five years.
[01:03:49.688 --> 01:03:54.991]  Fifteen years ago or so, you couldn't find organic food anywhere.
[01:03:56.218 --> 01:04:08.067]  But because of people looking for it and seeking it out, at first it was real expensive, now the market's gotten so big, it's gotten competition, it's gone down in value, and at most grocery stores, more than half the products, well, 90% of the milk, uh...
[01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:15.188]  Almost all of the different ketchups say sugar, you know, non-GMO sugar, no corn syrup.
[01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:17.049]  The point is we're winning there.
[01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:24.971]  That's why they're so scared of, don't let them have gardens, don't let them have local co-ops for meat, don't let them have milk, don't let them, shut them down!
[01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.831]  Don't let them, shut them down!
[01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:28.571]  Shut them down now!
[01:04:29.272 --> 01:04:30.952]  Because these people don't have all the power.
[01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:35.133]  And if you vote with your dollars, but not just supporting us across the board,
[01:04:35.862 --> 01:04:36.863]  It's over for the globalists.
[01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:39.765]  So of course they're coming in not wanting to label stuff as GMO.
[01:04:40.105 --> 01:04:41.206]  Because we're kicking their butt.
[01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:42.967]  They're crying uncle, folks.
[01:04:42.987 --> 01:04:44.608]  They're in a fetal position.
[01:04:45.409 --> 01:04:47.610]  It's the great powerful laws, but it's hollow.
[01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:52.453]  I don't want to go into a whole rant about this, but we can beat these people.
[01:04:52.874 --> 01:04:55.215]  And sure, they're coming in with fake organic and stuff now.
[01:04:55.496 --> 01:04:57.477]  They're going to try every trick in the book.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.921]  But humanity is going to kick their butt!
[01:05:00.261 --> 01:05:01.701]  So what if you've got a bunch of drones?
[01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.922]  So what if you've got a bunch of robots and crap?
[01:05:04.142 --> 01:05:05.742]  There's 7 billion of us!
[01:05:06.642 --> 01:05:08.903]  And only a few thousand globalists, okay?
[01:05:09.223 --> 01:05:10.203]  They're parasites.
[01:05:10.423 --> 01:05:12.004]  They try to confuse us all day.
[01:05:12.304 --> 01:05:15.105]  And when we're in a trance, we're confused, they can clean our clocks.
[01:05:15.825 --> 01:05:17.845]  They've been kicking our butt because we're asleep.
[01:05:19.046 --> 01:05:21.807]  But we get up and start fighting, folks, they're going to start falling.
[01:05:23.107 --> 01:05:23.967]  That's why they're scared.
[01:05:24.367 --> 01:05:24.967]  And they should be.
[01:05:25.368 --> 01:05:26.928]  And for all of you that serve the system,
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.301]  Your gut tells you to join us.
[01:05:29.341 --> 01:05:32.242]  Your intellect tells you to join us right now.
[01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.442]  You don't have to go out and speak out tomorrow.
[01:05:34.742 --> 01:05:36.583]  You don't have to go and fight the new Lord tomorrow.
[01:05:36.923 --> 01:05:37.984]  Join us in heart.
[01:05:38.524 --> 01:05:39.624]  Join us in spirit.
[01:05:39.744 --> 01:05:42.905]  And everything else flows out of that decision.
[01:05:44.266 --> 01:05:45.146]  Join us!
[01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:51.788]  We're here waiting with all those that fought for liberty in history, for all those that stood for honor, and everything good.
[01:05:52.188 --> 01:05:54.009]  Does it mean I'm perfect or you're perfect?
[01:05:54.089 --> 01:05:54.369]  No!
[01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:56.890]  But we turn our hearts towards good.
[01:05:57.702 --> 01:06:04.532]  We turn our hearts towards repenting for all the corruption and evil and decadence we've all been involved in.
[01:06:04.913 --> 01:06:08.978]  We begin by recognizing good from evil.
[01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.624]  Good from evil.
[01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.362]  We reject the corruption of the world.
[01:06:18.662 --> 01:06:19.563]  And what is the world?
[01:06:19.623 --> 01:06:30.574]  It's not the world, it's the princes, the principalities, the power, the globalists, the capitals, the systems, the evil ones that always try to get in control.
[01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:34.658]  We come out of Babylon and it's a decision.
[01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.961]  We are in Babylon, but not part of it.
[01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:41.223]  And I'm not talking like some preacher here, folks.
[01:06:41.763 --> 01:06:43.525]  I mean Babylon the GMO.
[01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:46.027]  Babylon fighting with your husband, fighting with your wife.
[01:06:46.507 --> 01:06:48.249]  I mean the whole Babylon.
[01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:50.191]  The thing is death.
[01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:58.418]  It's all it can deliver, because evil people that are willing to cheat and hurt others have a sickness within them.
[01:06:59.158 --> 01:07:00.419]  They're not powerful.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.382]  It's like Max Keiser said, I'm always saying cancer takes over.
[01:07:05.723 --> 01:07:11.087]  The globalists are like cancer, and if cancer had a consciousness, it would think it was winning, taking over the body politic.
[01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:12.387]  Oh, look how elitist I am.
[01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.109]  Look at my survival of the fittest.
[01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:15.690]  Look at my social Darwinism.
[01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:22.374]  But Max Keiser took it one step further, and he said, cancer... It's one of the most powerful quotes I've ever heard.
[01:07:25.256 --> 01:07:30.679]  The globalists, the banksters, this global organized crime syndicate, is like cancer.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.382]  They are programmed to take
[01:07:37.607 --> 01:07:41.708]  They are programmed to take it all.
[01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:47.290]  In fact, can we excise that clip and play it tomorrow night from the Kaiser interview last week?
[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:47.970]  That's it!
[01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:49.030]  Don't you get it?
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:08:02.914]  Because once you accept evil and corruption, once you don't care about innocence, once you decide to cheat and screw people and do bad things, even if you don't want to go all the way, you just do it a little bit, that's why they want to artificially make you poor so you'll do anything,
[01:08:03.593 --> 01:08:06.135]  So you'll be corrupt even though your heart doesn't want to be corrupt.
[01:08:06.356 --> 01:08:07.737]  You'll be corrupt to feed your kids.
[01:08:07.957 --> 01:08:10.840]  You'll be corrupt because the neighbor made fun of you because your car is broken down.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:11.860]  Well, you'll show him.
[01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:16.024]  They are programmed to take it all.
[01:08:16.224 --> 01:08:21.869]  And as soon as you get into corruption, there's always somebody ahead of you who will do something even more underhanded to get ahead.
[01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:24.572]  And there's somebody else who will do something even worse.
[01:08:24.992 --> 01:08:25.653]  And pretty soon,
[01:08:27.697 --> 01:08:28.258]  The U.N.
[01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:33.902]  and the Department of Defense are involved in child kidnapping and trafficking and it's in the news and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:08:34.503 --> 01:08:40.488]  Six years ago, a congresswoman asked Rumsfeld about the child kidnapping by the U.N.
[01:08:40.568 --> 01:08:46.853]  and contractors at the Pentagon, DynCorp, and he said, yeah, they did it and they're not going to get in trouble.
[01:08:50.557 --> 01:08:53.119]  I mean, we're talking about snatching little kids out of their backyards here.
[01:08:54.606 --> 01:09:04.574]  See, folks, when you sign on to evil, and again, the devil comes to you and says, oh, well, you do corrupt things, you do bad things, you know, you have bad thoughts, you might as well just go all the way.
[01:09:04.654 --> 01:09:05.735]  No, that's the lie, folks.
[01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:13.261]  Recognizing it's bad, recognizing it and saying, I don't want to be part of that, that's what pulls you out of the gravity well of evil.
[01:09:13.702 --> 01:09:17.585]  But if you just say, oh, that's the way it is, folks, it's hell in a handbasket.
[01:09:18.601 --> 01:09:24.385]  And there's, and people that dream of releasing bioweapons that will kill almost everybody.
[01:09:26.087 --> 01:09:35.294]  They want to release it, they fantasize about it, they talk about it, they put it in the literature, they've created a racial memory in the human race for it, and they are preparing to kill everybody.
[01:09:35.534 --> 01:09:43.560]  So, I mean, I'm telling you folks, that's what people say, oh, you've got, you're so brave, you've got so much courage, how do you work so hard, how do you do this, how do you do all this?
[01:09:46.164 --> 01:09:46.884]  I'm not brave.
[01:09:48.165 --> 01:09:49.586]  It's programmed to take it all.
[01:09:51.226 --> 01:09:53.747]  I'll draw a picture for you here at the end of the show right now.
[01:09:54.188 --> 01:09:57.949]  It's programmed to take it all, okay?
[01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:13.376]  Here's the global cancer, and it's on a timeline of wrecked civilizations and cultures that it's already destroyed.
[01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:16.147]  Need more paper.
[01:10:16.628 --> 01:10:17.948]  Point is, it's moving from history.
[01:10:18.689 --> 01:10:20.269]  Moving from history into the future.
[01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:22.611]  And it's gobbling things up.
[01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:26.793]  And it's just going into the inferno, because that's what it does.
[01:10:27.353 --> 01:10:28.954]  You know, the old parable of the frog.
[01:10:29.754 --> 01:10:35.317]  Scorpion comes up to it and says, I want to... I want you to give me a ride across the creek, across the river.
[01:10:35.337 --> 01:10:39.219]  And the frog says, but you'll stink me.
[01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:40.319]  And he said, no, I won't, I promise.
[01:10:40.699 --> 01:10:41.800]  And they get across the water.
[01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:45.707]  And the scorpion stings him, and the frog's laying there in pain, dying.
[01:10:45.727 --> 01:10:46.427]  He goes, why'd you do that?
[01:10:46.447 --> 01:10:47.108]  I was nice to you.
[01:10:47.528 --> 01:10:48.368]  He goes, well, I'm a scorpion.
[01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:52.971]  I mean, and I know that's very elementary, but that's what it is.
[01:10:53.432 --> 01:10:59.675]  They're programmed to take it all, and we're being pulled in to this gravitational pull.
[01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:12.063]  We're being pulled into this, and folks, if we won't even make the decision to try to get away from this, I mean, if we won't decide to even get away
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.220]  From this death machine, then there's no hope.
[01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:19.981]  And if you say there's no hope, a lot of you say, okay, it's bad, but there's no hope.
[01:11:20.001 --> 01:11:21.241]  Well, you've just given in to this.
[01:11:24.162 --> 01:11:26.242]  And the whole system's saying, oh, no, go in there.
[01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:27.883]  It's warm in there.
[01:11:27.923 --> 01:11:29.843]  Here, here, you know, let's, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:30.843]  Out of it.
[01:11:32.263 --> 01:11:35.504]  And getting, you know, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:37.884]  Chinese parable.
[01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:40.425]  You've got to decide you want out of this.
[01:11:42.124 --> 01:11:43.406]  And make that decision.
[01:11:43.646 --> 01:11:44.267]  Think about it.
[01:11:44.547 --> 01:11:45.147]  Meditate on it.
[01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.068]  Whatever you want to call that.
[01:11:46.509 --> 01:11:47.610]  And you will get out of this.
[01:11:48.591 --> 01:11:49.251]  We will get out of this.
[01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.793]  It doesn't mean we'll individually get out of it.
[01:11:51.193 --> 01:11:51.914]  See, that's the thing.
[01:11:51.934 --> 01:11:53.556]  You've got to be willing to die to beat this.
[01:11:54.897 --> 01:11:57.339]  Because he who was willing to give up his life for others gained it.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:03.125]  When you're afraid to die, they can use the fear to end up getting your life to begin with.
[01:12:05.234 --> 01:12:05.895]  I mean, you see what I'm saying?
[01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:07.616]  What matters is our progeny.
[01:12:07.977 --> 01:12:09.919]  And even people's children that aren't our children.
[01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:11.480]  The future of humanity.
[01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:14.483]  All the good that we've got is because good people stood up.
[01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.066]  There's, look, there's two trains in history.
[01:12:18.047 --> 01:12:18.347]  Okay?
[01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:21.470]  There's two tracks.
[01:12:22.931 --> 01:12:25.694]  There's the good track, and there's the bad track.
[01:12:26.602 --> 01:12:33.748]  And people that want to sell bad always want to dismantle the good track and to say it never even existed.
[01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:35.130]  They want to control reality.
[01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.172]  The good tracks, you know, all over the place.
[01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.174]  There's freedom involved, different decisions.
[01:12:40.254 --> 01:12:40.915]  It's not organized.
[01:12:41.455 --> 01:12:45.539]  Evil organizes because it has a lust to get rid of this.
[01:12:46.798 --> 01:12:49.420]  Because this is a reminder of everything that's good.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.581]  The globalists don't like you healthy.
[01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:52.662]  They don't like you smart.
[01:12:52.922 --> 01:12:58.345]  They're so into saying they're elitist, they poison and numb you down just so they can rule over you.
[01:13:00.226 --> 01:13:01.427]  Man, that's a group of losers.
[01:13:02.348 --> 01:13:05.129]  Alright, now I'm waxing philosophical.
[01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:08.912]  That's it for this edition of InfoWars Nightly Rant.
[01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:10.553]  See you back tomorrow night.
[01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:12.434]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for the third time.
