[00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:07.203]  It is the 15th day.
[00:00:36.730 --> 00:01:02.447]  Of November 2012, I am Alex Jones, your host, and I can undoubtedly, with butterflies in my stomach, which I never have, even when I'm speaking to thousands of people in a hall, I can unequivocally tell you that this is going to be the most important radio broadcast, hands down, that I have ever done.
[00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:12.518]  Now, we have not been blindsided by the secession movement, but it's almost like a bus that ran me over ten years ago.
[00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:29.914]  It's old news to us, but the new news is that it is now breaking nationwide and worldwide, and is a symbol and an indicator of the sleeping giant that is America awakening.
[00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:41.014]  And the entire globalist program has been built and designed to block what you are about to see unfold.
[00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:57.541]  I am going to make some announcements here today and I'm going to lay out plans for my deep study of the Constitution that can save this Republic if you execute them.
[00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:02.728]  Victory is in our grasp.
[00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:08.291]  People don't know that they're in tyranny until it really starts to get bad.
[00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:21.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, petitions to the White House under federal law have to be responded to when they reach a certain number.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.001]  It's now more than 15 states.
[00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.583]  It was just seven last night that went past that threshold.
[00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:32.548]  But secession itself is a red herring.
[00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.609]  I hope you're listening to me.
[00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.634]  What we really want is a new issuance of the Declaration of Independence signed July 4th, 1776.
[00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:55.820]  The purest American values, the purest essence of the United States was secession from a corrupt, distant corporate empire.
[00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:58.279]  Backed up by military force.
[00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:09.658]  We are recaptured by the progeny, by the literal and figurative offspring of those robber barons 235 years ago.
[00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:31.170]  We are at the crossroads, and the entire enemy battle plan that we've reverse-engineered is designed to suppress states' rights movements, because the states created the federal government, and it is not their right, it is not their duty, we the people that make the states.
[00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.651]  It is an absolute imperative beyond duty.
[00:03:35.972 --> 00:03:37.012]  It is survival.
[00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:47.395]  That we secede from the New World Order that has conquered us through fraud.
[00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:58.262]  That we declare the fraud, and declare the fraud null and void, and then reconstitute the Republic with a new Congress of the Several States.
[00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:03.565]  A new Declaration of Independence.
[00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:20.918]  We can't wait till July 4th, and everything we've moved forward with, with the nullification movement, the states' rights movement, the system has prepared for this and sold Obama as the next Lincoln, and said any states' rights movement is civil war.
[00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:23.840]  Glenn Beck is saying it's illegal and civil war.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.962]  It is the essence of America.
[00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:37.091]  And there's a new Ron Paul video he put out this morning at InfoWars.com that we just posted, so hit refresh, where he says secession is the ultimate American value.
[00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:40.254]  America is already gone!
[00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:44.859]  We must recognize that, pull out of the New World Order,
[00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:53.217]  Prosecute the criminals that have hijacked the Republic who don't flee, and then reconstitute the Republic.
[00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:57.544]  But we must first separate or die, to then rejoin.
[00:04:57.824 --> 00:04:58.405]  We'll be back.
[00:04:58.966 --> 00:04:59.386]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:11.860]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.616]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:09.761]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:12.344]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:15.068]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:06:15.128 --> 00:06:18.193]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:23.056]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.580]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.902]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:36.765]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.208]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:47.795]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:50.237]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:06:50.257 --> 00:06:51.798]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:05.889]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.351]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:17.496]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:20.838]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:07:21.118 --> 00:07:22.539]  There's no priming required.
[00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.840]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.681]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:27.541]  Use fluoride up to 95%.
[00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:29.962]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:07:30.162 --> 00:07:31.442]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:34.422]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:37.903]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:39.903]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.104]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:44.864]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:46.304]  It's what my family uses.
[00:07:46.564 --> 00:07:49.765]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:55.446]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.690]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:04.398]  We are on the march.
[00:08:04.738 --> 00:08:07.161]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:07.902 --> 00:08:11.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:37.436]  This day is a day that will be remembered forever in the hearts and minds of future generations, not just of Americans, but people worldwide who have rediscovered liberty and freedom.
[00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:42.140]  We are living on the edge, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.584]  This will be the most important broadcast in my 17 years on air.
[00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.091]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:54.031 --> 00:09:07.538]  We have warned of this, we have exposed it, we have seen the globalist preparations, and now things are unfolding exactly as we knew they would.
[00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:11.280]  But last night, at about midnight,
[00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:26.475]  After re-watching Ron Paul's most powerful and thought-provoking speech, his farewell speech, watching it for the second time last night, we're going to play some excerpts coming up today, everything crystallized.
[00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:38.986]  I already knew it intellectually, I'd already said it on air a hundred times in different ways, but it hit me with that electricity I've only felt a few other times in my life, the knowing.
[00:09:41.018 --> 00:10:04.114]  The knowing, the absolute destiny of this republic, the conviction that if I prosecute the war against the New World Order, if you take up the info war, and discredit and expose the enemy, and take up states' rights, and take up a new Declaration of Independence,
[00:10:05.253 --> 00:10:07.655]  The plans were laid by our forebears.
[00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:21.084]  The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, all chief, all key, all armaments for our protection, foreseeing the crisis we've now entered.
[00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:30.010]  The enemy's tools is a dumbed-down population, a drugged population, a selfish, evil, greedy, weak population.
[00:10:31.192 --> 00:10:32.473]  And they don't even outnumber us.
[00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:35.014]  It's a fraudulent election system, we know that.
[00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:41.016]  If the parasites didn't have the producers, they would fall.
[00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.838]  And we are now here, at the crossroads, and...
[00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:51.085]  We have Edwin Vreera joining us, constitutional lawyer, at the start of the next hour.
[00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:53.446]  We have Lou Rockwell joining us as well.
[00:10:53.907 --> 00:10:58.710]  And I'm going to make some huge announcements here and then try to be calm and walk through this.
[00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.812]  I've written like seven pages of notes here.
[00:11:01.172 --> 00:11:03.594]  I want to go over it with you here today.
[00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:09.318]  Now this is not complex, but this is not dumbed-down radio.
[00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:11.960]  This is a blueprint.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.942]  And if constitutional lawyers pick this up,
[00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:26.579]  If Ron Paul can be drafted, if you put the energy in today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, this is the beginning.
[00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:40.582]  Everything else has just been a build-up for the orchestra tuning up before the orchestra begins their true presentation.
[00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.490]  We are at the threshold of absolute history.
[00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:56.214]  We are plunging into bonafide, certified, razor sharp, total evil.
[00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:00.496]  Obama did something off the charts today.
[00:12:01.817 --> 00:12:09.380]  He signed a secret executive order handing over the internet to the NSA and foreign banks.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.941]  Unprecedented.
[00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:16.510]  We are now going under emergency rule right now.
[00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:27.940]  This has all been planned out, all war-gamed, but we, through historical research and thousands of whistleblowers from inside the system, many of which were killed or imprisoned,
[00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:32.088]  Remember, many people died to bring you this information.
[00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:39.192]  The only reason I'm alive right now is because people were willing in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s to be imprisoned and killed.
[00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.434]  They killed thousands of people.
[00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.496]  They arrested congressmen and tortured them.
[00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:48.498]  They hijacked aircraft and handed over congressmen to the North Koreans.
[00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:55.983]  They, to try to keep this down, those of us that came before the current awakening,
[00:12:57.915 --> 00:12:59.556]  We stand on their shoulders.
[00:13:01.557 --> 00:13:02.717]  So this isn't a game.
[00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:05.439]  I want to telegraph that to you right now.
[00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:12.683]  And what I'm going to say today, and what I'm taking up now, is the most dangerous thing I've ever done, and I feel no fear.
[00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:18.506]  I only feel fear that I will not execute this properly, and it's not fear.
[00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:26.250]  It is more of a gripping, bracing
[00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:35.869]  Realization as if the hand of God is wrapped around my heart saying, don't screw this up.
[00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:43.277]  You may be killed doing this, so in your greatest
[00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:47.509]  Moment of resistance!
[00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:49.090]  Ringing the bell!
[00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.551]  Signaling the beginning of the Second American Revolution!
[00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:54.931]  The Restoration!
[00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:56.331]  And the spirit of 1776!
[00:13:58.132 --> 00:13:59.652]  Don't screw this up, Jones!
[00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:01.712]  And I'll tell all of you this as well.
[00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:03.613]  You don't screw it up either!
[00:14:04.853 --> 00:14:06.753]  This is time for dedication!
[00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:09.134]  This is time for commitment!
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:13.335]  And the spiritual decision to sign your John Hancock
[00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:24.954]  In your words and your deeds towards the restoration of our Republic and putting us back on the course of liberty and justice for all.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.381]  And what am I going to call for here?
[00:14:34.522 --> 00:14:37.804]  I'm going to call for what is in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:39.826]  The founding document
[00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:46.630]  of July 4th, 1776.
[00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.312]  That is what I'm calling for.
[00:14:52.013 --> 00:14:53.093]  It is America.
[00:14:53.253 --> 00:14:55.214]  It is the birth of America.
[00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:59.377]  It is when it all started and we have the tools.
[00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:01.638]  We have the information.
[00:15:01.938 --> 00:15:10.203]  We have all of it before us in our hands if we will only take it up from this inspired document.
[00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:21.019]  The example of freedom worldwide and breathe life back into it and set those brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:25.183]  Let me lay out some basic facts here before I get into the battle plan.
[00:15:26.203 --> 00:15:31.188]  In the Info War, and the enemy will undoubtedly try to physically come down upon us.
[00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:35.411]  But that is part of the historical tide.
[00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:38.474]  And that is another sign of our victory.
[00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:51.712]  The 1.6 billion bullets, the checkpoints, the foreign trips, the army admitting re-education camps, that's a sign of failure and weakness of the collectivist, Borg, corporate, bankster state.
[00:15:56.294 --> 00:16:05.499]  The poison they poured out upon us, their venom, that was meant to paralyze those of us that love liberty, has only energized us while paralyzing and fogging their vision.
[00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:07.501]  They are confounded.
[00:16:07.741 --> 00:16:08.622]  They are confused.
[00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:11.303]  They are believing their own propaganda and lies.
[00:16:11.823 --> 00:16:16.965]  But I see in their eyes the seeds of their destruction and their failure.
[00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:25.988]  If only you will take up the gifts God has given us, the weapons that God gave our forebearers.
[00:16:27.435 --> 00:16:37.957]  So long lying in their armories collecting dust, we will resurrect these mighty weapons and we will use them tirelessly against the enemy.
[00:16:38.177 --> 00:16:44.659]  We will prosecute a war to restore the republic and run the money changers from the temple.
[00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:53.721]  Now here are some of the points I'm going to break down and I know Paul Watson and others are going to be codifying this into action plans and articles.
[00:16:55.225 --> 00:17:04.414]  Number one, Ron Paul in the videos up at InfoWars.com has said, secession is the essence of America and the birth of our Republic.
[00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:11.280]  It is more American than even George Washington because he flowed forth from that.
[00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:18.887]  It is the fount, the center, the core, the very blood
[00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:22.007]  of the Republic.
[00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.607]  It is July 4th.
[00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:25.588]  It is the freedom.
[00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:27.368]  It is the dignity.
[00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:35.991]  It is the absolute center of the universe on this planet for liberty and resistance to tyranny.
[00:17:36.432 --> 00:17:38.332]  It is our armor.
[00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:39.973]  It is our mind.
[00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:41.373]  It is our sword.
[00:17:41.673 --> 00:17:43.094]  It is our shield.
[00:17:43.874 --> 00:17:45.635]  It is our will.
[00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:50.885]  Now, I will expose the trap.
[00:17:51.306 --> 00:17:52.846]  The globalists are counterfeiters.
[00:17:53.506 --> 00:18:01.908]  They will take secession and they will repackage it as civil war and as racism and you're already seeing that.
[00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:04.169]  You already see them jumping on it.
[00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:04.829]  They were ready.
[00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:16.872]  It was secession from the British Empire by British citizens who were having their rights violated exactly as we are today after a long train of abuses.
[00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:27.057]  That led to them pulling out of that corrupt system to form a new union, to form a new system.
[00:18:27.117 --> 00:18:28.659]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.084]  And that it was not just their right, it was their duty to do so.
[00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:39.390]  And so we're saying rediscover that.
[00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:44.034]  Reissue a new Declaration of Independence.
[00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:49.982]  It may take a year, it may take two years, but accelerate the program, the idea.
[00:18:50.896 --> 00:19:05.466]  Literally storm your state houses, not demanding more government handouts, but as we stormed them over the TSA last year, and that's what the media called it, marching in, not asking, demanding that they throw the TSA out of our state.
[00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:12.170]  Unanimously voted in the House, killed by Dewhurst in the Senate, now we have removed him and he lost his Senate race.
[00:19:13.972 --> 00:19:16.253]  Now they're back with even more votes in the Senate.
[00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:20.016]  We are going to force the issue with the globalists, because here's the key.
[00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:23.437]  We're not seceding from the federal government.
[00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:32.644]  We are recognizing and declaring what is self-evident that the federal government has been hijacked by foreign banking cartels.
[00:19:33.024 --> 00:19:42.472]  You can go into the legislatures with the Times of London, CNBC, Time Magazine, hundreds of publications bragging we've been conquered.
[00:19:42.892 --> 00:19:43.533]  So we are
[00:19:44.173 --> 00:19:48.718]  Pulling out of the occupied false federal New World Order system.
[00:19:48.978 --> 00:19:54.803]  We are seceding from the New World Order hijackers to reconstitute the Republic.
[00:19:55.084 --> 00:19:56.385]  I have the battle plan.
[00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:58.247]  We're going to draft Ron Paul.
[00:19:58.547 --> 00:19:59.168]  Stay with me.
[00:19:59.188 --> 00:20:00.029]  Call everyone you know.
[00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:04.320]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.240]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.841]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.202]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:20:12.342 --> 00:20:15.723]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:21.725]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:20:21.985 --> 00:20:25.326]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:30.248]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:20:30.388 --> 00:20:36.049]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:37.350]  And here's the best news.
[00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.511]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:44.492]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:47.173]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators,
[00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:47.734]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:05.516]  Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.
[00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:08.737]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:12.058]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:23.701]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave.
[00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:28.422]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease, decay, or decline like I've been conditioned to believe.
[00:21:28.703 --> 00:21:30.263]  I began taking RNA drops
[00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:36.426]  A 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy.

[00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:38.962]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:39.022 --> 00:22:39.763]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.823 --> 00:22:45.967]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:46.087 --> 00:22:46.928]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:50.070]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:11.061]  A country occupied by foreign banks.
[00:24:12.925 --> 00:24:16.106]  Once you get to the point of tyranny, it just drops off a ledge.
[00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:49.341]  And the media, I've literally got probably 60 articles here, CBS News, NBC, you name it, showing Fort Sumter on fire that started the Civil War.
[00:24:50.462 --> 00:24:52.123]  Union ships bombarding the fort.
[00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:02.948]  I mean, this is so amazing, the type of things that are going on.
[00:25:06.192 --> 00:25:10.936]  And the media is saying it's racist, people don't like having a black president.
[00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:12.717]  Really?
[00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:15.779]  Was there secession calls four years ago?
[00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:16.060]  No.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.761]  We know Obama's a puppet.
[00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:22.925]  They're saying we're going to raise your taxes, we're going to pass VAT and carbon taxes.
[00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:23.786]  That's now in the news.
[00:25:24.006 --> 00:25:25.427]  We're going to give it to foreign banks.
[00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:29.250]  We're going to have the federal government totally take over your life.
[00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.871]  We're going to legalize all the illegals.
[00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:31.932]  We're going to open the country up.
[00:25:32.737 --> 00:25:33.718]  North American Union.
[00:25:34.219 --> 00:25:35.500]  And people are like, no you're not.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.822]  And they're like, yes you are.
[00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:41.947]  Hey, your state says they're going to enforce the law and I'll let TSA stick their hands down people's pants?
[00:25:46.472 --> 00:25:49.176]  Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do then.
[00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:52.868]  We're going
[00:26:10.888 --> 00:26:17.330]  The richest nation in the world, the highest education, highest IQ, longest lived, now we're at the back of the pack.
[00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.971]  We have been overrun by criminals with a bunch of fancy propaganda.
[00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:31.174]  And Ron Paul gave a speech yesterday, his farewell, where he said, we have state-run media, they've set up FEMA camps, we're going into world government.
[00:26:31.894 --> 00:26:36.676]  That's what's going to cure this, is slamming the facts down, because they're right there.
[00:26:38.237 --> 00:26:43.281]  Not listening to some of the people at Campaign for Liberty that have tried to infiltrate it, saying, don't talk about world government.
[00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:44.723]  Don't, you know, work with the system.
[00:26:44.943 --> 00:26:46.604]  Oh, Obama's got a mandate.
[00:26:46.684 --> 00:26:49.427]  Thank God Ron Paul's taking Campaign for Liberty back over.
[00:26:49.927 --> 00:26:51.869]  And listen, I'm going to lay out my battle plan.
[00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:52.809]  We come back from break.
[00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.252]  I'm so excited I've just given you some of the basic facts here.
[00:26:56.572 --> 00:26:57.493]  But I'm going to tell you this.
[00:26:57.553 --> 00:27:03.678]  Call everyone you know, whether you're listening on a local AM or FM station, whether you are listening on XM-168,
[00:27:06.431 --> 00:27:07.320]  Whether you are...
[00:27:10.424 --> 00:27:12.746]  Tuning 166, excuse me.
[00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:34.802]  Whether you are listening on the internet streams at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, call everyone you know and tell them to tune in now, because I've got a battle plan based on history, based on our Republic, based on our Bill of Rights and Constitution, and based on the fact that we have close to double the nations that we had a hundred years ago, because people want freedom.
[00:27:35.142 --> 00:27:37.244]  And when you've got a corrupt central government,
[00:27:38.024 --> 00:27:39.887]  Mexico used to be twice the size it is now.
[00:27:40.307 --> 00:27:42.270]  Not in the north, in the south.
[00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.753]  Guatemala and other countries peeled off.
[00:27:46.074 --> 00:27:55.426]  That is the natural thing, is to, when you get your federal government hijacked, you pull out, then you reconstitute,
[00:27:56.477 --> 00:27:58.897]  And then you go restore the federal government.
[00:27:58.957 --> 00:28:11.900]  I mean, look, if foreign enemies parachuted in and took over the White House and the Congress and announced, we're your new government, like something out of America with a K with Chris Christopherson, you would say, hey, the states have got to get together to go kick these guys out.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.600]  That's not our legitimate government.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.820]  That wouldn't be secession.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.381]  That would be the states organizing to reconstitute the republic.
[00:28:20.621 --> 00:28:25.522]  But to do that, they've got to exercise their states' rights of secession.
[00:28:27.717 --> 00:28:30.059]  Not secession to make Texas its own country.
[00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:32.641]  Not secession to make Oklahoma its own country.
[00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:37.044]  Not secession to make Missouri its own country or Illinois.
[00:28:37.364 --> 00:28:42.928]  Secession to say, here's our Bill of Rights and Constitution that our state constitutions are based on.
[00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.309]  This is what we follow.
[00:28:44.409 --> 00:28:45.270]  Not the UN.
[00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.831]  Not the New World Order.
[00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:48.192]  Not the Patriot Act.
[00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:49.693]  Not the NDAA.
[00:28:50.053 --> 00:28:51.214]  Federal Reserve out.
[00:28:51.614 --> 00:28:52.795]  New World Order out.
[00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:53.756]  Get out!
[00:28:54.176 --> 00:29:03.483]  Look at how they set the euro up to get the countries in debt fraudulently, shine them onto banker debt, implode them, and bring them into a total super union under central bank, private bank control.
[00:29:03.683 --> 00:29:05.325]  They brag about that on Bloomberg TV.
[00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:06.386]  That's all over the news.
[00:29:06.426 --> 00:29:09.508]  They say the banks set up the euro to take it over.
[00:29:09.728 --> 00:29:13.491]  They think you're so dumb, this is all admitted.
[00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:16.033]  So, just, I give praise to Ron Paul.
[00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:23.299]  You know, when you love somebody, and you love what they've done, and you get upset by some of the things you see some of his supporters in the power structure do,
[00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:27.918]  When you count on somebody, then it's personal, you get mad at them.
[00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:34.240]  And I've gotten mad a little bit at Ron Paul to get him back to realize what had happened to his organization.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.440]  I did it quietly, did it gently, but now it's happening.
[00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:45.063]  And I'm telling you, we need to draft Ron Paul to lead the second Continental Congress of the States!
[00:29:45.703 --> 00:29:49.564]  It's a new Declaration of Independence to restore the Republic!
[00:29:50.424 --> 00:29:51.304]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:53.325]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.021]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:01.415 --> 00:32:06.238]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:32:06.598 --> 00:32:09.359]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.961]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:14.602]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:32:14.622 --> 00:32:17.784]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:32:18.104 --> 00:32:22.666]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:29.188]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:29.488 --> 00:32:32.509]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:32:32.889 --> 00:32:36.370]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:14.602]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.261]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, history is being made now.
[00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:29.004]  As Ron Paul said in his speech yesterday that we're going to play excerpts of after Edwin Vieira leaves us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:33:29.584 --> 00:33:36.567]  Constitutional lawyer to break down our path towards victory against the globalist secession and reconstituting the republic.
[00:33:36.587 --> 00:33:39.829]  I'm going to lay that plan out as calmly as I can here in a moment.
[00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:47.094]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, Ron Paul's secession is an American principle.
[00:33:47.494 --> 00:33:48.595]  That video's up there.
[00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:53.278]  In his final speech, Ron Paul warns of continuous march towards fascism.
[00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:54.940]  That's a Steve Watson article.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.600]  That's a quote.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.581]  He said this is a conscious...
[00:33:58.482 --> 00:33:59.542]  Sounded like I wrote the speech.
[00:33:59.602 --> 00:34:01.963]  I know we're on the same page, but man, Ron Paul really gets it.
[00:34:02.243 --> 00:34:09.825]  This is a conscious, tyrannical, planned, seizure, takeover by world government conquering the U.S.
[00:34:09.945 --> 00:34:14.386]  And God bless him, he told the truth and laid it out.
[00:34:15.206 --> 00:34:17.806]  We're not gonna beat these people like the media says.
[00:34:18.187 --> 00:34:20.047]  Oh, go join the Democrats, call for socialism.
[00:34:20.868 --> 00:34:22.129]  That's all election fraud.
[00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:23.049]  It's all a scam.
[00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.171]  12 to 15, 20 million.
[00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:27.772]  The numbers are varied.
[00:34:28.392 --> 00:34:30.434]  Ron Paul Libertarians didn't vote for Romney.
[00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:31.935]  That's why he didn't get in.
[00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:34.816]  Because people aren't playing games anymore.
[00:34:35.016 --> 00:34:37.418]  They're not buying 3 to 5 million guns a month.
[00:34:38.158 --> 00:34:39.139]  And buying ammo.
[00:34:40.099 --> 00:34:41.740]  And signing a million, 200,000 petitions to secede.
[00:34:46.724 --> 00:34:49.445]  Because they're playing games anymore.
[00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:59.028]  And I saw one of the top neocon talk show hosts, I have his quotes here, coming out and saying, do not sign that petition.
[00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:01.808]  The government will come round you up.
[00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:08.290]  That's like telling John Hancock and Thomas Jefferson, don't sign the Declaration of Independence.
[00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.971]  Here, you see the Declaration of Independence?
[00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:11.271]  Give me a document cam shot, guys.
[00:35:11.731 --> 00:35:12.612]  I'm going to sign this.
[00:35:12.992 --> 00:35:13.952]  This is what it's all about.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.226]  I was up in Hot Springs last year on a three-day vacation with my family, and they had a constitutional women's group there at one of the museums handing out free constitutions on Constitution Day, and they gave you a chance to sign it.
[00:35:25.767 --> 00:35:26.447]  And that's the point.
[00:35:26.947 --> 00:35:28.308]  Alex Jones!
[00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:29.349]  See that?
[00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:31.150]  That's where you get freedom.
[00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:37.594]  Telling these bullies, these scum, these illegitimate New World Order trash, we're not playing games with you.
[00:35:37.794 --> 00:35:40.516]  Let me read from this that these vampires don't like.
[00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:41.937]  It's like high noon to them.
[00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:45.766]  While evils are sufferable, it goes on here.
[00:35:50.575 --> 00:35:53.598]  People to alter or abolish it and to institute new government.
[00:35:54.198 --> 00:36:12.914]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.983]  Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light or transient causes.
[00:36:24.363 --> 00:36:36.169]  And accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed or conditioned.
[00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:54.828]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such governments and to provide new guards for their future security.
[00:36:56.148 --> 00:36:58.169]  And look, I signed my name to it right here.
[00:36:59.188 --> 00:37:01.469]  I signed my name to this.
[00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:03.390]  Sign your name.
[00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:04.850]  It is a symbol.
[00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:05.711]  God sees it.
[00:37:06.071 --> 00:37:11.753]  Print it out, or if you've got a parchment one hanging on the wall, get in there and sign it.
[00:37:11.773 --> 00:37:15.014]  In fact, we've got back there parchment constitutions hanging.
[00:37:16.315 --> 00:37:17.675]  I want them pulled off the wall.
[00:37:18.595 --> 00:37:19.936]  I want the Declaration of Independence.
[00:37:20.056 --> 00:37:21.216]  I want it pulled out of the frame.
[00:37:21.236 --> 00:37:21.857]  I'm going to sign it.
[00:37:22.357 --> 00:37:23.517]  Because that's what it's about.
[00:37:24.077 --> 00:37:25.158]  I mean, look at this headline.
[00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:29.361]  Glenn Beck says, are you out of your mind?
[00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:30.562]  They'll come round you up.
[00:37:30.622 --> 00:37:34.442]  My God, that man is a Benedict Arnold with stuff like that.
[00:37:34.702 --> 00:37:35.762]  Or maybe he's just a coward.
[00:37:35.783 --> 00:37:37.283]  He's got like 30 security people.
[00:37:37.863 --> 00:37:40.803]  I just go out to Bilderberg streets, have a thousand people around me.
[00:37:40.983 --> 00:37:42.324]  And people are like, that's crazy, Jones.
[00:37:42.364 --> 00:37:42.844]  Why do you do that?
[00:37:43.104 --> 00:37:45.244]  Why do you tell folks where you're going, where you're going to be?
[00:37:45.384 --> 00:37:46.744]  Because it's in God's hands!
[00:37:46.984 --> 00:37:47.605]  That's why!
[00:37:47.625 --> 00:37:53.386]  The tree of liberty has to be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:37:53.586 --> 00:37:55.006]  And I'm not living in fear.
[00:37:56.152 --> 00:37:59.173]  I'm signing my name onto Liberty and I'm in 110%.
[00:38:00.674 --> 00:38:01.374]  I'm all in.
[00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:02.535]  I'm doubling down.
[00:38:03.055 --> 00:38:04.376]  There's no more backing off.
[00:38:04.396 --> 00:38:05.816]  There's no more playing games.
[00:38:06.056 --> 00:38:07.497]  There's no more half measures.
[00:38:07.937 --> 00:38:10.478]  You're either for freedom or you're going to be a slave.
[00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:17.021]  Now let me give you my plan and I want to start out first with how they're going to counter strike.
[00:38:18.001 --> 00:38:18.542]  You've seen it.
[00:38:18.802 --> 00:38:19.703]  I told you for years.
[00:38:20.043 --> 00:38:24.848]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act says for insurrection by the states, governors, and legislatures.
[00:38:25.188 --> 00:38:28.311]  This is 2007 they were getting ready for this.
[00:38:28.532 --> 00:38:29.693]  This is a long-term plan.
[00:38:30.013 --> 00:38:37.180]  They were getting rid of Posse Comitatus, getting Brigade Homeland set up, 400,000 troops for domestic operations, NORTHCOM standing up.
[00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:48.725]  The drones, all of the massive preparations that were going on and being established and being set up while all of this was going on.
[00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:55.547]  They said in the 2007 John Warren Defense Authorization Act, it says, and I read it on air to you,
[00:38:56.787 --> 00:38:58.808]  They are preparing to block the states.
[00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:10.472]  They're worried about the Governor's Council, even though most of them are their operatives, because we could take that back over, and that's the logical place to have a new Continental Congress of the states to restore the Republic.
[00:39:10.752 --> 00:39:11.612]  Not a secession.
[00:39:11.992 --> 00:39:14.213]  Recognizing our government's been hijacked.
[00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:14.873]  That's the key.
[00:39:15.113 --> 00:39:15.933]  That's not words.
[00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:16.434]  That's true.
[00:39:16.694 --> 00:39:18.914]  They have declared they have conquered us.
[00:39:19.114 --> 00:39:23.516]  That's a legal posting in over 200 newspapers I've seen in just the last year.
[00:39:24.525 --> 00:39:25.105]  I've shown them.
[00:39:25.345 --> 00:39:29.046]  Paul Watson and I wrote the article, Bankers Declare They've Conquered Europe and the U.S.
[00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:31.386]  Our first issue of the magazine covered that.
[00:39:32.407 --> 00:39:33.767]  Bankers Declare They've Conquered Us.
[00:39:34.987 --> 00:39:36.568]  That is a legal posting.
[00:39:36.748 --> 00:39:41.729]  These people are lawyers because they leave back doors, escape hatches for themselves.
[00:39:42.289 --> 00:39:52.651]  That's why we understand their battle plan because this barrel of snakes follows a program to exempt themselves from their tyranny.
[00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:53.750]  Okay?
[00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:55.111]  Now listen to me.
[00:39:55.992 --> 00:39:57.473]  They've got the military set.
[00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:58.854]  They've got the military ready.
[00:39:59.214 --> 00:40:00.815]  Rick Perry joked and said, we'll secede.
[00:40:00.855 --> 00:40:03.276]  They put the military on alert and surrounding states to invade.
[00:40:03.557 --> 00:40:03.837]  Good.
[00:40:03.917 --> 00:40:04.998]  Throw me in that briar patch.
[00:40:05.218 --> 00:40:05.878]  Let's get it on.
[00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:06.659]  Let's start it.
[00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:09.921]  Let's have you come in and knock some heads and put army on the streets.
[00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.482]  Let's get it going here.
[00:40:12.162 --> 00:40:12.923]  Not physical.
[00:40:13.243 --> 00:40:15.805]  Don't, don't, don't fight them when they do this.
[00:40:16.225 --> 00:40:21.809]  Let the redcoats occupy like they did for a decade before it really got going.
[00:40:22.509 --> 00:40:27.315]  Let the redcoats come in, let them rape women, speak out against it.
[00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:30.719]  If you see it happening, you've got a moral duty to defend the woman.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.323]  But no offensive attacks!
[00:40:34.304 --> 00:40:35.906]  No offensive attacks!
[00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:38.048]  Let their evil flow!
[00:40:39.195 --> 00:40:39.876]  Continue.
[00:40:39.956 --> 00:40:41.217]  They want to start the fight.
[00:40:41.597 --> 00:40:43.078]  Let them shoot first.
[00:40:43.558 --> 00:40:44.879]  We have the moral high ground.
[00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:50.564]  They'll probably stage some false flags to then blame it on us just so they can get the moral high ground.
[00:40:50.864 --> 00:40:55.407]  Continue to expose their main weapon that we've almost destroyed, false flag.
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:41:00.139]  False flag, inside job, staged event, provocative event.
[00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:01.480]  It's now in the nomenclature.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.761]  It's now in the popular culture.
[00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:06.004]  Keep running that offense on them.
[00:41:06.705 --> 00:41:09.047]  Attack in all directions, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:09.247 --> 00:41:11.148]  We've been waiting to be fully surrounded.
[00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.932]  We've been waiting for everything we warned to come to pass.
[00:41:15.012 --> 00:41:20.777]  We fought against it while building next phase resistance systems, okay?
[00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:25.771]  That's why we said from deep behind enemy lines, I know I'm in FEMA Region 6.
[00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:29.833]  I know the globalists admit they conquered us decades ago with the National Security Act.
[00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:31.874]  Now they want to conquer you physically.
[00:41:32.174 --> 00:41:36.676]  Now they really want to break your will and break your back and get you ready for this.
[00:41:38.237 --> 00:41:47.822]  And break you financially so you go on food stamps and go on welfare and ship all our jobs overseas and use bank or bailout money to ship our jobs overseas.
[00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:53.425]  Everything was about bringing us down, making us dependent, demoralizing us, breaking up our families.
[00:41:54.345 --> 00:42:04.651]  Making the general public these gibbering, empty demons that get off on the idea of evil, but squeal like little pigs when they get caught in the vice grips of something real.
[00:42:05.052 --> 00:42:07.633]  Who have no idea what real darkness is.
[00:42:07.853 --> 00:42:10.595]  Who have no idea what hell is really like.
[00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:14.177]  Have no idea what the stench of tyranny really smells like.
[00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:17.399]  Well, you little fools are gonna get to smell it!
[00:42:20.703 --> 00:42:26.166]  The weak are fascinated and worship at the altar of evil because they believe it has power.
[00:42:27.807 --> 00:42:35.671]  But once evil really gets turned loose, they will beat their heads and pull their hair out and they will beg.
[00:42:36.211 --> 00:42:39.152]  They will beg for justice and there will be none!
[00:42:42.674 --> 00:42:44.395]  The wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:42:46.974 --> 00:42:49.295]  The pit they've dug for us, they will fall into.
[00:42:49.355 --> 00:42:50.276]  Now let me lay it out.
[00:42:50.716 --> 00:42:52.317]  They're going to invoke race war.
[00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:53.617]  You've seen it.
[00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:55.098]  You don't like government-run healthcare?
[00:42:55.138 --> 00:42:55.698]  You're a racist.
[00:42:55.998 --> 00:42:57.019]  You don't like world government?
[00:42:57.039 --> 00:42:57.659]  You're a racist.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.300]  You don't like election fraud?
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.880]  You're a racist.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.441]  You're a racist.
[00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:00.921]  You're a racist.
[00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:01.941]  It's that division.
[00:43:02.381 --> 00:43:15.128]  With the illegals and the inner-city folks and the poor people who are victims of the mind control, just like the general public, that will be the globalist weapons system and their constituency.
[00:43:16.008 --> 00:43:19.470]  They're paramilitary police, and the military are starting to wake up.
[00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:31.918]  But still, a lot of them are such authoritarians and drunk on power, and drunk on the idea that they're moral, and drunk on the brainwashing they've been given, that a lot of them will try to prosecute a war of intimidation against us.
[00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:34.580]  And we've got to hold, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:35.498 --> 00:43:39.402]  It's like, it's like Andrew Jackson said, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
[00:43:39.802 --> 00:43:45.448]  Politically, just let them keep engaging us and abusing and stomping all over us.
[00:43:45.969 --> 00:43:49.152]  And just document, document, document, document, document.
[00:43:49.452 --> 00:43:50.753]  While moving politically to...
[00:43:51.314 --> 00:43:52.315]  Delegitimize them.
[00:43:52.535 --> 00:43:53.396]  To expose them.
[00:43:53.756 --> 00:43:56.858]  When they brag and post public notices that they've conquered us.
[00:43:57.279 --> 00:43:58.239]  We've been conquered.
[00:43:58.279 --> 00:43:59.140]  We've been taken over.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.541]  They're trying to mop up the media.
[00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.063]  They put the internet kill switch in years ago.
[00:44:03.103 --> 00:44:04.824]  Now they've announced it under secret order.
[00:44:05.265 --> 00:44:08.007]  They're getting ready the new wars to try to get us to rally around.
[00:44:08.227 --> 00:44:09.488]  The economic implosions.
[00:44:09.688 --> 00:44:09.988]  All of it.
[00:44:10.008 --> 00:44:12.150]  This is going to be one Hades of a fight.
[00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:17.794]  But if we don't give up and keep pounding in the info war, we're going to win.
[00:44:17.974 --> 00:44:19.996]  Now, did you call everybody you know and tell them to tune in?
[00:44:20.016 --> 00:44:20.977]  Because I'm going to lay this out.
[00:44:23.484 --> 00:44:26.351]  The globalists will stage false flags to kill the state's rights.
[00:44:26.611 --> 00:44:29.137]  Declaration of Independence 2.0 movement.
[00:44:29.598 --> 00:44:30.119]  That's what it is.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.222]  Declaration of Independence 2.0.
[00:44:32.405 --> 00:44:33.367]  Restoring the Republic.
[00:44:34.053 --> 00:44:35.313]  They're going to stage false flags.
[00:44:36.134 --> 00:44:38.914]  They're going to roll up gun owners and call them paramilitary forces.
[00:44:39.195 --> 00:44:43.216]  They've already got petitions to form federal militias to invade as commissars.
[00:44:43.256 --> 00:44:44.176]  That's at whitehouse.gov.
[00:44:44.196 --> 00:44:45.416]  I'm going to cover it in a moment.
[00:44:45.717 --> 00:44:46.917]  They're already saying deport us.
[00:44:47.157 --> 00:44:48.397]  They're already saying arrest us.
[00:44:48.697 --> 00:44:53.599]  They've already sold the idea in like eight movies that have come out and all these magazines that
[00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:58.862]  Obama's the Abraham Lincoln that there's going to be a civil war and that he will stop the racist.
[00:44:59.162 --> 00:45:03.045]  And the media is saying it's secession 2.0, civil war.
[00:45:03.345 --> 00:45:04.806]  We're going to fight the gray coats.
[00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:05.947]  We're going to fight that.
[00:45:05.987 --> 00:45:07.488]  That's already the branding.
[00:45:08.088 --> 00:45:08.488]  No, no, no.
[00:45:08.529 --> 00:45:10.230]  We're not fighting gray coats and blue coats.
[00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.212]  This is northerner, southerner, westerner, black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:45:14.252 --> 00:45:18.535]  If you want freedom, if you want out from under socialism and globalism, then you are 1776.
[00:45:18.915 --> 00:45:19.075]  Own it.
[00:45:19.095 --> 00:45:19.516]  Become it.
[00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:28.723]  I mean, you know, those of you that have been globalist minions, those of you that have been socialist, you know it's delivering you into bondage.
[00:45:28.743 --> 00:45:30.024]  You know it doesn't fulfill you.
[00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:35.069]  You know there's a tingle in your heart and in your mind, in your soul, when you hear me speak.
[00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:39.913]  You want to join your brothers and sisters in liberty, in history, that have stood up against tyrants.
[00:45:40.313 --> 00:45:44.356]  We're fighting the same thing our ancestors fought over and over again in different permutations.
[00:45:44.637 --> 00:45:56.326]  And the globalists demonize the Bill of Rights and Constitution because even though it was never fully implemented, the ideas that it enshrines are anathema to the despot, to the tyrant, to the king rat.
[00:45:56.606 --> 00:45:58.768]  And you are at the threshold.
[00:45:58.888 --> 00:46:00.449]  You are the resistance.
[00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.031]  You are the leaders.
[00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:04.527]  They're going to invoke race war.
[00:46:05.168 --> 00:46:08.350]  They're going to invoke separation of men and women.
[00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:10.592]  They're going to invoke more attacks on the family.
[00:46:10.612 --> 00:46:17.758]  They're going to hammer the economy and say, give the bankers unlimited trillions in new taxes and austerity or we're going to implode you.
[00:46:17.959 --> 00:46:21.281]  They're going to then put more people on welfare so that they've got to survive.
[00:46:21.502 --> 00:46:27.226]  They're forcing us onto the plantation, onto the slave reservation, onto the control grid.
[00:46:28.427 --> 00:46:45.371]  They are going to, again, say it is secession, and that it's violent, and go find, you know, goofballs and guys out there on their little farm saying, I'm the president of this, I'm the president of that, I'm the president of Oklahoma, I'm the president of Texas, I'm the president of New Mexico, to make it look kooky.
[00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:47.252]  I'm laying out their battle plan.
[00:46:47.292 --> 00:46:48.532]  I told you this was all coming.
[00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:51.026]  They trained the military.
[00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:53.227]  They trained NORTHCOM for this.
[00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:56.009]  They understand this is the remedy in the Constitution.
[00:46:56.789 --> 00:47:01.092]  Not some secession where some guy declares himself the King of Texas.
[00:47:01.969 --> 00:47:09.511]  But Texans saying the federal government has been hijacked by foreign globalists that have bragged that they've conquered us.
[00:47:09.891 --> 00:47:18.314]  You go into the legislatures with papers, with the examples of the news and the bankers announcing that there's a world government and we've been conquered.
[00:47:18.594 --> 00:47:20.355]  Their announcement we've been conquered.
[00:47:20.595 --> 00:47:24.976]  You go in with a Declaration of Independence saying it's our right and duty to throw this off.
[00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:37.004]  You call for the state legislature associations, the gubernatorial associations, not the new 10-member FEMA Governor's Council that's the counterfeit over the governors getting together.
[00:47:37.244 --> 00:47:41.907]  Or the Rural Affairs under Department of Defense Homeland Security to run the rural areas.
[00:47:42.127 --> 00:47:51.333]  This is an emergency reorganization plan by design modeled after the Mao and Lenin and Stalin takeovers of those countries and surrounding areas.
[00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:53.054]  We know their attack profile.
[00:47:53.314 --> 00:47:54.555]  We know their bombing runs.
[00:47:54.815 --> 00:47:55.756]  We know their plan.
[00:47:56.176 --> 00:47:58.337]  All we've got to do is face how much trouble we're in.
[00:47:58.477 --> 00:47:59.338]  We can beat these people.
[00:47:59.498 --> 00:48:02.960]  But folks, if you don't grow up and realize, oh my gosh, Alex Jones was right.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.461]  Oh my gosh, Ron Paul was right.
[00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.062]  Oh my gosh, this is real!
[00:48:06.282 --> 00:48:07.883]  Oh my gosh, we've got to do something!
[00:48:08.144 --> 00:48:09.785]  We've got to go do banner hangs right now.
[00:48:09.965 --> 00:48:11.226]  We've got to call in to talk radio.
[00:48:11.486 --> 00:48:16.729]  We've got to go to the legislatures, even if they're not in session, and go in and say, we know what's going on.
[00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:18.110]  Stand up, do something.
[00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.151]  Stop being a coward!
[00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:29.828]  The globalists are purging our military right now because I know from high-level multiple sources, and you've seen all the resignations, that the military said no to this NORTHCOM takeover plan.
[00:48:29.848 --> 00:48:33.591]  The military said, we're not going to arrest governors and people.
[00:48:33.871 --> 00:48:35.453]  We're not going to arrest newspaper editors.
[00:48:35.633 --> 00:48:37.094]  We're not going to arrest talk show hosts.
[00:48:37.255 --> 00:48:38.736]  We're not going to do gun confiscation.
[00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:43.320]  Do you understand that's a suicide mission and cannot be practiced?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.581]  It's not practicable.
[00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:46.806]  It is not practical!
[00:48:47.406 --> 00:48:49.027]  It will wipe out our forces!
[00:48:49.287 --> 00:48:50.107]  Are you insane?
[00:48:50.647 --> 00:48:53.347]  And, see, it's not that the top generals are even moral, on average.
[00:48:53.627 --> 00:49:01.989]  They understand, wait, we're overextended everywhere, most of the troops are out of the country, there's all these mercenaries here, you want us to try to take 180 million gun owners' guns?
[00:49:02.209 --> 00:49:05.310]  If 1% stand up, that's 1.8 mil!
[00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.130]  There's no way!
[00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:12.531]  Admiral Yamamoto said if we ever invaded the mainland of the U.S., there'd be a rifle behind every blade of grass!
[00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:20.517]  That's the execution of the military and the police by the globalists to bring us into total anarchy.
[00:49:20.877 --> 00:49:34.468]  If the military and the police try to execute the gun confiscations that Obama and the NRA has documented, has planned, physical turn-ins of all semi-autos, there will be a civil war when that starts.
[00:49:34.809 --> 00:49:37.251]  People that resist will be called terrorists.
[00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:42.847]  They've got, I mean, folks, they had drones and helicopters over Austin, black helicopters this morning.
[00:49:42.887 --> 00:49:43.647]  It's even in the news.
[00:49:43.887 --> 00:49:45.607]  The Department of, I mean, they are ready.
[00:49:46.267 --> 00:49:46.607]  Okay?
[00:49:46.687 --> 00:49:51.028]  I mean, they want to hammer down again.
[00:49:51.728 --> 00:49:53.169]  So we need to be nonviolent.
[00:49:53.229 --> 00:49:54.149]  We need to be prepared.
[00:49:54.209 --> 00:49:56.709]  We need to let people know, though, this is going to happen.
[00:49:57.549 --> 00:50:00.450]  People are listening to all of us now because everything we've talked about's happened.
[00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.470]  So when we come back, I'm going to give you the keys.
[00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:03.871]  I've told you what they're going to do.
[00:50:03.891 --> 00:50:05.371]  I'm going to tell you what we need to do.
[00:50:06.596 --> 00:50:12.821]  We need to draft Ron Paul to try to organize through their state movement, Campaign for Liberty, that was full of operatives.
[00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:16.884]  Of course, you know something like that's going to get infiltrated by young punks that want to be stars in the Republican Party.
[00:50:17.124 --> 00:50:18.385]  Ron Paul's retaking control of it.
[00:50:18.785 --> 00:50:29.433]  They need to direct for a calm meeting of governors and legislatures, circulating petitions, circulating legislation that Ron Paul writes, and other competing legislation.
[00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:37.016]  To restore the republic, not secession, but to recognize at the state level the globalists have seized our country.
[00:50:37.356 --> 00:50:39.397]  They're overthrowing the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:50:39.697 --> 00:50:44.439]  We are not seceding to destroy the republic, but to unite the republic.
[00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:46.619]  They want to build this as a civil war.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.980]  That's been their plan.
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.561]  They will stage false flags.
[00:50:49.961 --> 00:50:51.701]  We enter the prime danger zone.
[00:50:52.062 --> 00:50:55.243]  We are here to restore the republic through secession.
[00:50:55.503 --> 00:50:58.224]  We must unjoin and then reunite.
[00:50:58.644 --> 00:50:59.184]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.224 --> 00:51:00.725]  We'll be back.
[00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:07.009]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.071]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:51:10.332 --> 00:51:12.673]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:51:12.873 --> 00:51:15.375]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:51:15.555 --> 00:51:18.517]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:51:18.837 --> 00:51:23.379]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[00:51:30.223 --> 00:51:33.185]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:51:33.865 --> 00:51:35.225]  You're taking control of my future.
[00:51:35.485 --> 00:51:37.086]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:40.547]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[00:53:05.997 --> 00:53:07.618]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:12.160]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.242]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[00:53:16.522 --> 00:53:20.024]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:25.627]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[00:53:25.868 --> 00:53:29.610]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:34.953]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[00:53:35.353 --> 00:53:41.697]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[00:53:42.038 --> 00:53:49.423]  Order online at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com, spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y, waterfilters.com.
[00:53:49.783 --> 00:53:52.365]  Or call 877-99-BERKEY.
[00:53:52.665 --> 00:53:56.228]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[00:53:56.628 --> 00:53:57.809]  Gift well this Christmas.
[00:53:58.029 --> 00:53:59.450]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:54:13.346 --> 00:54:16.290]  We can restore the republic if you want it.
[00:54:17.779 --> 00:54:20.341]  But the only way to do it is to realize we've been overtaken.
[00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:22.922]  We've been seized at the federal level.
[00:54:23.463 --> 00:54:28.326]  Most of the governors are globalist operatives who've proven that they're good servants of evil to the foreign banks.
[00:54:28.806 --> 00:54:34.810]  Some of the governors are saying, oh, let's not have secession so that they can try to get a job higher up in the new world order.
[00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:39.534]  Folks, the globalists want to wreck the United States and then reorganize it.
[00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:44.836]  The globalists want to just have you go along with whatever they say and do.
[00:54:45.216 --> 00:54:59.643]  We have got to accelerate the state's rights movement, the nullification movement, and we have to control the debate and not let them, which they've been waiting for, phrase it as racist and a hillbilly claiming he's the president of this state or that state.
[00:55:00.043 --> 00:55:00.684]  We have to say no!
[00:55:01.824 --> 00:55:03.285]  It's the Declaration of Independence.
[00:55:03.445 --> 00:55:06.347]  We're going to secede to restore the Republic.
[00:55:06.367 --> 00:55:15.454]  And if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, I have a poster here that is an example of this.
[00:55:16.294 --> 00:55:21.278]  This is from 1775-1776, the Joiner Die.
[00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:30.865]  And it's the New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
[00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:52.117]  Maine, you've got the states right here that were the colonies that were being overrun and treated like slaves and checkpoints on the roads and all the rest of people being executed for no reason, corrupt courts, everything that's in the Declaration of Independence, that terrorist document FEMA demonizes because it's July 4th.
[00:55:52.277 --> 00:55:53.358]  It is the heart of America.
[00:55:53.658 --> 00:55:58.879]  It is your mommy and daddy getting in bed and making you, folks, when you were conceived.
[00:55:59.259 --> 00:56:01.079]  It is the zenith, okay?
[00:56:02.512 --> 00:56:03.353]  It is the fount.
[00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:06.218]  Now what's happened is the globalists have come in.
[00:56:06.658 --> 00:56:09.803]  They've come in and they've taken control of the head.
[00:56:10.464 --> 00:56:15.151]  And then the head has gone into all the parts and extracted the wealth.
[00:56:17.571 --> 00:56:18.131]  You understand?
[00:56:18.191 --> 00:56:32.762]  To bring it back to the head so that we've got this giant New World Order head and all these little parts of the states that are actually giant, but the state government itself has been made this little, you know, federal vestigial thing.
[00:56:33.322 --> 00:56:46.512]  We have to separate from the hijacked globalist government and we have to go with the pieces of the states and reconstitute the new head and then we join.
[00:56:47.995 --> 00:56:48.515]  You understand?
[00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:50.037]  Then we rejoin.
[00:56:50.798 --> 00:56:52.039]  This has been seized.
[00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:54.041]  Everything is to explain.
[00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:55.162]  This is hijacked.
[00:56:55.202 --> 00:56:56.183]  This is fascist.
[00:56:56.463 --> 00:56:58.665]  Not in word, folks, in reality.
[00:56:59.085 --> 00:57:00.827]  Ron Paul broke it down in a 49-minute speech.
[00:57:01.047 --> 00:57:01.868]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:57:02.088 --> 00:57:04.991]  FEMA camps, mass arrests, gun confiscations, civil war.
[00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:07.893]  The states are like, hey, we created you.
[00:57:07.913 --> 00:57:09.155]  You've been taken over by foreign banks.
[00:57:09.175 --> 00:57:10.015]  We don't like what you're doing.
[00:57:10.436 --> 00:57:13.619]  These are all filled with globalist operatives, though, but we the people live here.
[00:57:15.447 --> 00:57:17.308]  So, we start movements everywhere.
[00:57:17.368 --> 00:57:28.396]  If we get one tail to start pulling out and get our message out that it's about restoring the republic and kicking the globalists out, the others will fall into place.
[00:57:29.017 --> 00:57:33.300]  It will give other people moral courage in county, city, state government, the federal government.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.564]  The generals have had courage saying no to all these new wars and saying they won't start this takeover.
[00:57:39.004 --> 00:57:39.945]  We've got to stand with them.
[00:57:40.706 --> 00:57:44.969]  And this will give people moral courage to say no within the big leviathan head.
[00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:51.473]  So we kick the leviathan out of the country and we restore the republic.
[00:57:51.973 --> 00:57:53.074]  Now how do we get that done?
[00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:54.475]  I'm going to break this down more with
[00:57:56.016 --> 00:58:00.740]  Constitutional lawyers who haven't even heard my breakdown on this yet, but I'm just following the Bill of Rights Constitution history.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.461]  I know they're going to agree.
[00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:02.762]  You watch when Lou Rockwell's on.
[00:58:02.982 --> 00:58:04.723]  You watch when Edwin Vieira constitutional lawyer's on.
[00:58:04.763 --> 00:58:05.144]  You watch.
[00:58:05.344 --> 00:58:06.105]  Haven't even talked to him yet.
[00:58:06.125 --> 00:58:07.766]  Just said, come on the show about secession.
[00:58:07.986 --> 00:58:08.447]  You watch.
[00:58:08.587 --> 00:58:11.029]  They're going to totally agree with me because I've studied this deeply.
[00:58:11.249 --> 00:58:12.050]  This is the path.
[00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.711]  This is what our forebearers gave us.
[00:58:14.552 --> 00:58:17.374]  It is secession because the federal government's gone.
[00:58:17.434 --> 00:58:17.955]  It's captured.
[00:58:18.535 --> 00:58:22.779]  We have to secede from that fraud, the Federal Reserve occupied government.
[00:58:23.459 --> 00:58:26.941]  To then recombine under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:58:27.602 --> 00:58:30.043]  Don't let them try to rewrite something bad in this new thing.
[00:58:30.604 --> 00:58:31.504]  They'll try that too.
[00:58:31.544 --> 00:58:32.885]  That's another attack we've got to worry about.
[00:58:33.105 --> 00:58:38.389]  But first, we've got to go, get the word out, get the bills written up, and get the secession going!
[00:58:43.792 --> 00:58:47.755]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.956 --> 00:58:53.738]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:58:54.018 --> 00:58:55.699]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:59.301]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:58:59.621 --> 00:59:01.683]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:59:01.823 --> 00:59:05.245]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:59:05.465 --> 00:59:11.269]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:14.891]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:19.854]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:59:19.995 --> 00:59:25.719]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:59:25.959 --> 00:59:27.020]  And here's the best news.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:34.205]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[00:59:34.325 --> 00:59:38.168]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so,
[00:59:40.149 --> 00:59:42.031]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:59:42.152 --> 00:59:44.014]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:59:44.234 --> 00:59:46.297]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[00:59:46.437 --> 00:59:48.359]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:59:48.479 --> 00:59:50.362]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:59:54.106 --> 00:59:56.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:59.252]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.765 --> 01:00:09.946]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:11.406]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.187 --> 01:00:13.067]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.727 --> 01:00:17.348]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.908 --> 01:00:21.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.604 --> 01:00:37.729]  Neal, Khan, Benedict, Becks and others are running around right now saying don't sign petitions that go to Obama, you'll get on a list.
[01:00:38.149 --> 01:00:41.611]  Oh, there's a million two hundred thousand people now on a list?
[01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:43.072]  Hey, let's put everybody on the list!
[01:00:43.853 --> 01:00:56.560]  Again, it's a public declaration that we don't agree with being told we're socialist slaves to foreign banks for banker bailouts and for the new socialist hordes that have almost got the numbers now to vote out our guns in a democracy when we're a republic.
[01:00:57.699 --> 01:01:04.147]  I mean, it's coming to the time to just say no to all of it, and to just start non-complying, folks, every way you can.
[01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:06.490]  The system is foreign, it is our enemy.
[01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:16.623]  Now, to those that say, don't sign these petitions, look, the petitions aren't even the direction to go, but it's a manifestation of people saying, we're registering our displeasure.
[01:01:17.847 --> 01:01:38.381]  The real place is petitions at your state level, going to your statehouse, getting movements going, getting Ron Paul drafted, to have a movement, exploratory committees, to try to reconstitute a new Continental Congress with legislative heads, governors, and other patriots that want to come create a master document off of working documents that were being passed around.
[01:01:38.401 --> 01:01:44.145]  I'm going to break this down with Constitutional Lawyer Vieira here in a moment, but let me sign this for everyone.
[01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:45.666]  This is in the Congress, July 4th, 1776.
[01:01:48.327 --> 01:01:52.431]  The unanimous declaration of the 13 states of America.
[01:01:53.351 --> 01:01:57.194]  They seceded from the corrupt British Empire and created their new government.
[01:01:57.454 --> 01:02:03.259]  We're seceding from the New World Order that hijacked and killed the Republic and we're re-uploading the Republic.
[01:02:03.659 --> 01:02:09.524]  We're taking their fraudulent software off and we're saying we're going to install this and we're going to stand on this.
[01:02:09.724 --> 01:02:11.786]  Let's see you try to call us terrorists and traitors.
[01:02:12.446 --> 01:02:13.627]  Can anybody understand that?
[01:02:13.948 --> 01:02:14.488]  I'm gonna sign it.
[01:02:14.629 --> 01:02:16.591]  See, John Hancock, it was a death warrant.
[01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:19.734]  And many people lost their families, lost everything that signed this.
[01:02:20.295 --> 01:02:26.442]  I, spiritually, I'm going back to July 4, 1776, because the neocons are saying, don't you dare sign these.
[01:02:26.722 --> 01:02:33.290]  And I am publicly signing the Declaration of Independence against the New World Order, against the Federal Reserve, against the globalists.
[01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.653]  And I stand with those in Europe fighting for their sovereignty against the very same crime syndicate.
[01:02:38.053 --> 01:02:43.937]  I sign this Declaration of Independence against the globalist scum, 2012.
[01:02:44.138 --> 01:02:51.202]  And I'm taking you out right now with the Star Spangled Banner by the late, great Whitney Houston.
[01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:55.766]  We'll be back to break down the battle plan to restore the Republic.
[01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:26.888]  Who's brought stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
[01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:18.397]  For the land of the free.
[01:04:18.437 --> 01:04:20.138]  Will you fight for our republic?
[01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:24.141]  Will you defend?
[01:04:24.321 --> 01:04:27.744]  Or will you become slaves?
[01:04:28.684 --> 01:04:30.125]  The bankers say they've conquered us.
[01:04:30.926 --> 01:04:32.107]  I say they're in for a fight.
[01:04:32.807 --> 01:04:33.368]  Go forth.
[01:04:33.908 --> 01:04:36.130]  The second American Revolution is upon us.
[01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:43.498]  We shall return to break down the battle plan.
[01:04:44.058 --> 01:04:44.659]  Stay with us.
[01:04:45.739 --> 01:04:46.439]  Info Wars.

[01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:10.673]  The U.S.
[01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:14.855]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:06:14.975 --> 01:06:17.536]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:19.176]  They want that attack to come.

[01:06:33.634 --> 01:06:41.060]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.923]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:06:44.124 --> 01:06:46.767]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:08:03.849 --> 01:08:10.176]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:11.878 --> 01:08:17.303]  I know you deceived me, now here's a surprise.
[01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:24.411]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes.
[01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:35.476]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:08:35.516 --> 01:08:35.876]  Eastern.
[01:08:36.276 --> 01:08:43.559]  We're going to Edwin Vieira Jr., holds four degrees from Harvard, is a PhD of their law school.
[01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:49.822]  I'm not going to go over it all, but he is one of Ron Paul's advisors and favorite constitutional lawyers, one of mine as well.
[01:08:49.842 --> 01:08:50.403]  We're going to be getting...
[01:08:51.623 --> 01:08:58.034]  So many other constitutional lawyers on, like Stuart Rhodes, we're also in the next few days going to be getting...
[01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:04.889]  Mr. Feinon is one of Ron Paul's advisors and a congressional advisor, constitutional lawyer.
[01:09:05.949 --> 01:09:07.410]  I've read the Declaration of Independence.
[01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:08.930]  I've read the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:13.912]  I read the debates in the newspapers from the time I have talked to literally hundreds of constitutional lawyers.
[01:09:13.952 --> 01:09:21.574]  I've studied the law and I wanted to get one of the chief recognized experts and one of the founders of the modern militia movement.
[01:09:22.955 --> 01:09:26.716]  From a point of law on with us, a man who's launched a lot of major
[01:09:27.716 --> 01:09:33.501]  Uh, major movements we see today based on what we saw 230 plus years ago.
[01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:38.666]  But to restate it for stations that just joined us, this is the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[01:09:39.066 --> 01:09:47.913]  The manifestation of 1,200,000 and counting signatures by all 50 states, now over 15 states qualifying for the White House to have to respond.
[01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:50.475]  That is more than symbolic.
[01:09:50.495 --> 01:09:54.437]  It shows the people saying, we will not go under socialism.
[01:09:54.717 --> 01:09:55.777]  We are not slaves.
[01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:57.818]  This is all unconstitutional.
[01:09:57.858 --> 01:10:04.521]  Northcom, NDAA, government health care written by foreign bank-owned insurance companies.
[01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:05.602]  We're not going along with this.
[01:10:05.682 --> 01:10:09.323]  And Ron Paul, in his incredible speech, we're going to play some excerpts coming up.
[01:10:09.343 --> 01:10:11.744]  49 minutes, it's up at Infowars.com.
[01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.565]  He said, we're under fascism.
[01:10:13.985 --> 01:10:14.906]  It's premeditated.
[01:10:15.366 --> 01:10:17.067]  It is psychopathic organized evil.
[01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:17.667]  These are quotes.
[01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:33.833]  By the way, he said they are, it is world government, they have announced all over the news, we played the clips, ad nauseum, where they say we've been conquered by foreign banks and laughed at us on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, Financial Times of London.
[01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:39.575]  This is a legal declaration, just as Europe's been conquered by being signed on to banker derivatives.
[01:10:40.415 --> 01:10:41.275]  We are now here.
[01:10:41.995 --> 01:10:42.996]  We are being conquered.
[01:10:43.596 --> 01:10:49.679]  And I say, as we go to the lawyer, to the constitutional lawyer to get his, one of the chief experts, to get his take on this plan.
[01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:51.399]  And I don't know his take on this yet.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.921]  I mean, I do know what it's going to be, because I've read his books, researched what he's saying.
[01:10:55.221 --> 01:11:05.765]  But we have to get out front and not let hundreds of newspapers, TV, say it's racist to talk about seceding, and that people are mad because Obama's black.
[01:11:05.805 --> 01:11:08.967]  No, we're mad because he's announcing cyber security takeover.
[01:11:09.867 --> 01:11:10.587]  Executive order.
[01:11:10.627 --> 01:11:12.428]  Because they're announcing we're under socialism.
[01:11:12.628 --> 01:11:14.489]  Because the country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:17.710]  We have to point out the blue states are all going bankrupt.
[01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:21.811]  Not that the Republicans are much better, but people at least voted for the lesser of two evils there.
[01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:24.292]  They understand the road to perdition we're on.
[01:11:25.252 --> 01:11:28.573]  We must go to the legislatures, and I want Mr. Vieira's take on this right now.
[01:11:28.813 --> 01:11:33.835]  We must go to the legislatures now and say, with
[01:11:35.353 --> 01:11:41.154]  Versions of a new Declaration of Independence with the same facts in the original from 1776, July 4th.
[01:11:42.015 --> 01:12:03.760]  And say, we need to have groups organized through the Governor's Council, not the fake FEMA one, but the real Governor's Council, the legislative councils, led by people like Dr. Vieira, like Ron Paul, like Lou Rockwell, like countless other patriots out there, that it's now time to say, we are seceding to restore the Republic
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:16.865]  But to also reconstitute the federal government which is fascistic, is tyrannical, is spying on us illegally, and is producing a total tyranny of domination because they know the people are waking up.
[01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:20.927]  It is now time to admit how bad it is and move at the states and explain.
[01:12:22.067 --> 01:12:24.849]  The country's been conquered by globalists, as Ron Paul said in his speech.
[01:12:24.889 --> 01:12:25.689]  Let's just tell it like it is.
[01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:26.190]  They bragged.
[01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:28.471]  Reconstitute the Republic.
[01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:30.092]  Secession for survival.
[01:12:30.532 --> 01:12:32.393]  Secession to restore the Republic.
[01:12:32.674 --> 01:12:35.335]  Secession because we've been conquered by foreign banks.
[01:12:35.996 --> 01:12:37.096]  And get that word out.
[01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.137]  Get different petitions circulating.
[01:12:39.177 --> 01:12:42.259]  Get different versions of the new Declaration of Independence.
[01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:46.942]  Then have a large meeting of governors, legislators that want to come.
[01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:48.483]  Organized by Ron Paul.
[01:12:48.743 --> 01:12:56.689]  Campaign for Liberty because he's respected and because we trust him to have that meeting and then to go forth building that idea.
[01:12:56.949 --> 01:12:58.450]  This went on for a decade before 1776.
[01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.472]  We've got to do this before they come for the guns.
[01:13:01.932 --> 01:13:03.153]  They're planning a civil war.
[01:13:03.173 --> 01:13:05.575]  They're now billing it that Obama's Lincoln too.
[01:13:06.335 --> 01:13:07.556]  The states are racist.
[01:13:08.377 --> 01:13:08.657]  They've got
[01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:09.857]  Petitions at the White House.
[01:13:09.977 --> 01:13:10.577]  I've got it right here.
[01:13:10.597 --> 01:13:12.418]  I'll show you a document cam shot of your viewer.
[01:13:12.838 --> 01:13:14.778]  To arrest people signing the petitions.
[01:13:15.098 --> 01:13:16.839]  To organize federal militias.
[01:13:17.079 --> 01:13:18.239]  To occupy the states.
[01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:20.020]  To implement all these plans.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.880]  Folks, this is going to really get bad.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.441]  They're now going to try to totally take over America.
[01:13:25.181 --> 01:13:28.441]  They've said they're going to try to say all semi-autos have to be handed in.
[01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:30.322]  Now again, his website...
[01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:32.508]  We'll give that to you in a moment.
[01:13:32.588 --> 01:13:33.649]  Edwin Vieira Jr.
[01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.910]  holds four degrees from Harvard, A.B.
[01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:36.970]  Harvard College, A.M.
[01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.591]  with Ph.D.
[01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:40.092]  Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and J.D.
[01:13:40.132 --> 01:13:40.912]  Harvard Law School.
[01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:44.133]  For more than 30 years, he's practiced law with emphasis on constitutional issues.
[01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:52.417]  In the Supreme Court of the United States, he successfully argued or briefed the case leading to the landmark decision, Bood v. Detroit Board of Education, Chicago Teachers.
[01:13:52.437 --> 01:13:58.039]  I'm not going to go over all his landmark cases, but, I mean, he is chief amongst constitutional lawyers.
[01:13:58.419 --> 01:14:00.260]  I've done my excited introduction, sir.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:17.706]  But the crest of the wave from Julius Caesar, the play written by, well, the greatest playwright of all time, William Shakespeare, his version of Julius Caesar, there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:20.307]  Our fortune is liberty and freedom.
[01:14:20.347 --> 01:14:21.528]  That's the treasure we seek.
[01:14:21.828 --> 01:14:29.911]  Can you not intellectually, but also in your gut, sir, feel the great wave that is now cresting and we've got to surf that thing into victory?
[01:14:30.271 --> 01:14:31.992]  Now is the time to go on the offense.
[01:14:32.232 --> 01:14:44.937]  What do you think of my statement of redeclaration of independence, a re-upload of the original republic, and kicking out and trashing this new world order takeover, sir?
[01:14:45.937 --> 01:14:48.999]  Well, I think that's the key element.
[01:14:49.039 --> 01:14:53.901]  This is not really a revolutionary activity that we're talking about.
[01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:54.381]  It's a restoration.
[01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:57.502]  A restoration of the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:14:58.732 --> 01:15:04.113]  And then a restoration of the constitutional principles, which are founded on the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:23.398]  So I've become a little bit leery of the... bantered around too freely, because I don't think the goal ultimately is for particular states to remove themselves from the Union in the sense of becoming independent republics, independent sovereignties, but to assert
[01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:48.893]  State authority, which is really at the basis of the entire federal system, so as to restore the principles of the Constitution in Washington, D.C., to the extent that that can be done in the long term, and in the short term, to return as much economic and political power to the states and the people as is possible.
[01:15:49.733 --> 01:15:54.315]  So I've always said this is a matter fundamentally of what I would call interposition number one.
[01:15:54.924 --> 01:16:15.168]  The states stepping forward and telling those people in Washington that there are certain lines that cannot be crossed constitutionally, and if they are, the states will assert the powers that they have under the Constitution to interpose themselves in favor of their people against, essentially, rogue attacks that are coming out of the District of Columbia.
[01:16:15.688 --> 01:16:22.089]  And then secondly, the enactment of certain kinds of legislation that is completely constitutional, completely within the authorities of the states to
[01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:23.307]  I think so.
[01:16:38.883 --> 01:16:42.126]  Congress, the President, the court system, even the states themselves.
[01:16:42.606 --> 01:16:52.774]  They were put in there for a very specific purpose because the Founding Fathers understood, as the Second Amendment tells us, a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:16:53.194 --> 01:16:57.918]  And this concept of a free state is the ultimate purpose of both the Constitution and the Declaration.
[01:16:58.298 --> 01:17:01.881]  So that, in a sense, as Ford Motor Company used to say, is job one.
[01:17:02.221 --> 01:17:07.806]  We have to restore those institutions to their constitutional position within each of the states.
[01:17:08.346 --> 01:17:20.131]  And when we do that, those institutions become a foundation for taking many actions that are necessary to give the states the kind of political and economic, I won't say autonomy necessarily, but certainly clout.
[01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:29.574]  You can't have a really independent state political and economic policy while the state and its people are tied to the Federal Reserve System.
[01:17:30.335 --> 01:17:31.055]  It's impossible.
[01:17:31.599 --> 01:17:39.421]  You have to have an alternative monetary system, and we're going to need that in any event because the Federal Reserve System is coming down one way or the other.
[01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:41.641]  It's going to go in a very serious crisis.
[01:17:41.921 --> 01:17:44.982]  Could be hyperinflationary, could be a depression, could be a combination of both.
[01:17:45.802 --> 01:17:53.103]  But the end of that fiat money central banking paradigm, if you will, you can see it on the near horizon.
[01:17:53.564 --> 01:17:54.504]  So that's step number one.
[01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:55.764]  That could be done through a militia.
[01:17:56.405 --> 01:18:01.134]  Uh, we need to take control of food security and energy security with each state.
[01:18:01.675 --> 01:18:03.158]  That can be done through state militia.
[01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:07.727]  We need to assert all of the aspects of local homeland security.
[01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:09.058]  We're good to go.
[01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:33.807]  Officials in the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, whatever, have precisely no authority under those circumstances.
[01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:37.128]  So you essentially freeze them out of this process as well.
[01:18:37.528 --> 01:18:46.092]  So there's a whole series of steps that can be taken, but they have to be taken within the clear constitutional paradigm.
[01:18:46.412 --> 01:18:47.553]  That's really our problem.
[01:18:47.573 --> 01:18:54.216]  You know, this is a situation where we've been driving the Mercedes down the road, and now all of a sudden the engine starts chugging and it stops.
[01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:57.397]  And we go out, we lift up the hood, and we look
[01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.215]  We don't know what to do.
[01:19:00.076 --> 01:19:00.516]  Why not?
[01:19:00.796 --> 01:19:06.882]  Because we haven't read the Book of Instructions, which tells us, go fill up the gas tank on a regular basis, right?
[01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:10.625]  Look at the gas gauge, look at the oil gauge, whatever it is, right?
[01:19:10.665 --> 01:19:25.358]  We have a Book of Instructions the Founding Fathers gave us for living in a free state under a limited government in which the first purpose is, as the Preamble says, securing the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
[01:19:25.646 --> 01:19:29.208]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, constitutional lawyer, advisor to Ron Paul, is our guest.
[01:19:29.668 --> 01:19:30.549]  I want you to continue, sir.
[01:19:30.569 --> 01:19:33.291]  We're going to skip this network break, because this is so important.
[01:19:33.311 --> 01:19:41.476]  What I'm saying is, you're a constitutional lawyer, and obviously we have a right to secede, we have a right to revolt.
[01:19:42.356 --> 01:19:51.902]  My point is, I've always been leery of secession, because the system just demonizes it as a new civil war, and they say, it's been decided you can't secede because of what Abraham Lincoln did.
[01:19:52.402 --> 01:19:56.045]  Obviously, though, this isn't even a question of the federal government being out of control.
[01:19:56.565 --> 01:19:58.446]  The globalists have taken over the federal government.
[01:19:58.466 --> 01:20:07.192]  So I am saying the way to phrase it, and I've seen this get through to people because it's the reality, is foreign banks brag they've captured the federal government.
[01:20:07.252 --> 01:20:10.414]  It's totally destroyed the federal system, the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:20:11.054 --> 01:20:12.515]  They call us anti-federalists.
[01:20:12.535 --> 01:20:13.956]  They're not even following the federal system.
[01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:14.937]  This is globalism.
[01:20:15.397 --> 01:20:16.338]  This is New World Order.
[01:20:16.358 --> 01:20:17.278]  So what I'm saying is,
[01:20:18.679 --> 01:20:24.183]  With the dumbed-down public, they can grasp secession, that we want our own states, we're disagreeing with what you're doing.
[01:20:24.783 --> 01:20:30.227]  It will accelerate this process because the feds call states' rights secession.
[01:20:30.547 --> 01:20:32.208]  They don't even think there should be a state.
[01:20:32.548 --> 01:20:38.812]  And so if states say they should decide what the speed limit is, you know, I mean, Democrats say, hey, let's just go arrest their governor.
[01:20:39.773 --> 01:20:44.196]  So we know there's a federal globalist socialist tyranny now running Washington.
[01:20:44.216 --> 01:20:48.879]  As Ron Paul says in his speech, it's over if we don't reverse this.
[01:20:49.359 --> 01:20:55.763]  I'm saying it's now time to up the ante and say, okay, we call secession
[01:20:56.463 --> 01:21:14.122]  kicking out the occupying globalists to restore the republic because the feds have been captured we're going to move at the states and start having that discussion of a different type of secession to restore the republic because you have the states secede saying we're still america dc isn't america
[01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:15.062]  Doctor.
[01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:26.546]  And so we're going to do it to re-upload the Bill of Rights Constitution via the Declaration of Independence because the federal government has been lost to foreign special interests.
[01:21:26.566 --> 01:21:42.211]  That's my point is we have to clearly make the break and have the state leaders, members of the federal system, start meeting, start having discussions, start circulating, as you know for many years, you know, a new Declaration of Independence or
[01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:42.811]  That's
[01:22:03.575 --> 01:22:04.935]  They're now bankrupting the states.
[01:22:04.955 --> 01:22:10.997]  I mean, the feds are coming in, sir, as you know, under new rules saying $100,000 fine if you wash your car in your yard.
[01:22:11.698 --> 01:22:14.339]  Six years in jail if your dog craps in your own yard.
[01:22:14.379 --> 01:22:15.099]  Excuse my French.
[01:22:15.359 --> 01:22:18.520]  I mean, the tyranny was dribbling out now.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.561]  The cup has been turned over, sir.
[01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:24.082]  So what I'm saying is, I'm calling to draft Ron Paul.
[01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:26.803]  We're writing up and codifying a basic battle plan.
[01:22:27.503 --> 01:22:31.067]  He's stating, hey, secession isn't create our other countries.
[01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:32.509]  Our country's gone.
[01:22:32.549 --> 01:22:36.354]  We want the states that created America to recreate it.
[01:22:36.374 --> 01:22:37.235]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:22:37.435 --> 01:22:38.256]  Kind of a reboot?
[01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:52.611]  Well, yes, and I agree with this principle because I have said, and I have a book coming out very shortly which goes into great detail, that when you talk about the Declaration of Independence, for instance, it was not really a revolutionary document.
[01:22:53.191 --> 01:23:04.615]  It was a document that looked to the restoration of the principles, the laws of nature and of nature's God, which they believed, quite rightly, that King George and his ministerial government were violating.
[01:23:05.276 --> 01:23:07.477]  And that's essentially our problem today.
[01:23:07.537 --> 01:23:10.458]  It's the same Declaration of Independence type situation.
[01:23:11.039 --> 01:23:13.800]  You have people in a central governmental apparatus.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.700]  Lawless criminals!
[01:23:15.381 --> 01:23:19.623]  Well, however you want to describe them, they are violating the fundamental laws of this country.
[01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:22.904]  They're violating the principles of the Declaration of Independence through globalism.
[01:23:22.944 --> 01:23:24.385]  They're violating the laws of nature.
[01:23:24.425 --> 01:23:25.986]  Nature's God, left, right, and center.
[01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:28.307]  And doing this with impunity.
[01:23:29.073 --> 01:23:32.856]  And we have a federal system that is built upon checks and balances.
[01:23:33.237 --> 01:23:39.482]  And if we look at that imbalance, which is coming out of the District of Columbia, and ask, what are the checks that are supposed to be brought into play?
[01:23:39.822 --> 01:23:40.603]  Well, they are two.
[01:23:41.023 --> 01:23:45.466]  They are the state governments, number one, because they're in the middle of this pyramidal structure.
[01:23:45.747 --> 01:23:49.570]  And then at the base, the thing that forms the foundation, the people themselves.
[01:23:50.490 --> 01:23:52.471]  We have been very lax in those two levels.
[01:23:53.071 --> 01:24:07.237]  In the states essentially pushing back against these encroachments coming out of Washington, and ultimately in the people not demanding of their state governments, as well as the government in Washington, that these kinds of actions be taken consistent with the Constitution.
[01:24:07.858 --> 01:24:12.860]  So I say, I'm really not in favor of the word secession because that tends to throw people's minds back
[01:24:13.829 --> 01:24:17.532]  to the historical period of the Civil War.
[01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:22.116]  Okay, then what do you exactly, so we need to, exactly, so I have a battle plan.
[01:24:22.136 --> 01:24:34.166]  We need to come up with a basic plan with you and others of what to call it to start our own petitions just because it gets media attention on the White House website so that people see the real way.
[01:24:34.546 --> 01:24:36.528]  So we call for a second
[01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:45.386]  State Continental Congress to have the states meet and say what do we do about this rogue federal government?
[01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.270]  And so what do we call that, sir?
[01:24:49.034 --> 01:24:58.103]  Well, I'd call it a committee to restore the constitutional principles in this country, and maybe cut that down into a soundbite, but basically that's what we're doing.
[01:24:58.503 --> 01:25:01.666]  Constitutional principles, and of course the principle of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:25:02.046 --> 01:25:05.390]  Because the real danger looming down the road is globalism.
[01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:10.554]  It's the destruction of the separate and equal status among the nations of the world.
[01:25:10.615 --> 01:25:11.415]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:25:12.796 --> 01:25:15.057]  That's it, exactly, exactly, doctor.
[01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:28.863]  So what I'm asking you, as the top constitutional lawyer, is we need to explain this to a six-year-old level to get it out there because the media is phrasing any state's rights as Civil War Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:29.403 --> 01:25:33.485]  And so, and so, or you know, Reconstruction, whatever, and that's how they want to roll this out.
[01:25:33.825 --> 01:25:37.247]  I'm saying we just, to take control of it, we label
[01:25:38.047 --> 01:25:47.413]  The Constitutional Restoration Movement as secession from the globalists, from the occupied federal government, not the secession that the Democrats told you about.
[01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:51.355]  So we need to explain that America has been conquered by globalism.
[01:25:51.956 --> 01:25:53.337]  This is a restoration.
[01:25:53.377 --> 01:25:56.159]  But how do you put that out to people to explain?
[01:25:56.179 --> 01:26:01.082]  Because for me, that's the key, is that folks, the government's gone.
[01:26:01.162 --> 01:26:02.442]  That's why it's so lawless.
[01:26:02.663 --> 01:26:04.524]  They're under technocrats in Europe now.
[01:26:04.804 --> 01:26:05.885]  This is bona fide.
[01:26:06.545 --> 01:26:08.790]  I mean, Ron Paul's speech lays it out, folks.
[01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:09.632]  We're in it.
[01:26:09.752 --> 01:26:10.614]  This is real.
[01:26:11.095 --> 01:26:15.363]  And so I'm saying get the states, movements, people think it's a petition to Obama.
[01:26:15.564 --> 01:26:17.408]  That's good to get attention with ideas.
[01:26:18.399 --> 01:26:21.420]  That's like circulating petitions before 1776, as you know.
[01:26:22.001 --> 01:26:34.667]  But I'm saying get petitions going, get committee hearings in the state legislatures, get this buzz going, because this is what the whole globalist architecture is set up to block, because it's the key to restoring our republic.
[01:26:34.887 --> 01:26:38.909]  Their entire defense is set up against this, because this is the answer.
[01:26:39.729 --> 01:26:40.590]  Well, I think that's right.
[01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:41.730]  Two things.
[01:26:42.751 --> 01:26:45.312]  We wanted to project the idea
[01:26:46.044 --> 01:26:50.328]  That we maintain our independence from this globalist structure.
[01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:54.151]  I don't like the idea of saying we're seceding from it, because I don't think they've won yet.
[01:26:54.331 --> 01:26:55.952]  They're close to it, but they haven't won yet.
[01:26:56.613 --> 01:27:09.723]  And I don't like the word secession, because the other side uses that to bring up the concept of slavery, racism, and so forth and so on, which I think is an entirely red herring, because it doesn't make any difference whether you're black or white.
[01:27:10.043 --> 01:27:11.825]  Liberty is the best thing for you.
[01:27:12.543 --> 01:27:13.004]  Period.
[01:27:13.164 --> 01:27:13.925]  End of discussion.
[01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:23.578]  But they're going to play on that word constantly in order to divide and conquer people on a racial basis.
[01:27:24.259 --> 01:27:26.321]  So we don't want to give them that rhetorical...
[01:27:27.623 --> 01:27:27.703]  He's
[01:27:46.742 --> 01:27:50.864]  And through Ron Paul to find those leaders at the state level who will take a position in the forefront.
[01:28:14.696 --> 01:28:16.137]  That's always been my concern.
[01:28:16.757 --> 01:28:23.082]  After you go beyond Ron Paul, where are the leaders at the state level who are going to perform this function?
[01:28:23.102 --> 01:28:23.602]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:23.962 --> 01:28:24.183]  Right?
[01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:25.464]  But this is his greatest moment.
[01:28:25.504 --> 01:28:26.104]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:26.164 --> 01:28:36.511]  And with you, and with Mr. Fine, and other constitutional lawyers who have charted from our births the way forward, it's our responsibility.
[01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:40.574]  There is no doubt that Ron Paul, you and others, must get together.
[01:28:40.854 --> 01:28:43.096]  This is where Campaign for Liberty must go.
[01:28:44.599 --> 01:28:45.380]  Well, I think that's right.
[01:28:46.341 --> 01:28:56.029]  And the very fact that there is such a groundswell developing in this country, now is the time to take advantage of that.
[01:28:56.249 --> 01:28:56.990]  It's history, sir.
[01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:57.691]  This is 1776.
[01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:01.974]  In my heart and intellectually, do you not feel that and know that, sir?
[01:29:02.455 --> 01:29:03.336]  Well, it's probably about 1773.
[01:29:05.427 --> 01:29:07.408]  Probably closer to it if you look at the history.
[01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:10.671]  Yes, yes, but I mean, I'm in the birth of it.
[01:29:10.931 --> 01:29:19.978]  When they started organizing politically, when they started looking forward to what they feared was going to happen if the king and the ministry didn't accede to some reforms.
[01:29:20.698 --> 01:29:24.459]  It took them two or three years to get that organization, that structure set up.
[01:29:24.899 --> 01:29:33.741]  And then finally, when the British government refused to comply with the colonists' justifiable demands, then of course other things happened.
[01:29:33.761 --> 01:29:34.361]  Stay there, sir.
[01:29:34.401 --> 01:29:36.001]  Walk us through this for five, six more minutes.
[01:29:36.061 --> 01:29:38.042]  On the other side, then we'll play clips of the Ron Paul speech.
[01:29:38.622 --> 01:29:39.002]  Exactly.
[01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:40.062]  I'm saying this is the beginning of 1776.
[01:29:41.222 --> 01:29:43.783]  As I said in the last hour, this will take two to three years.
[01:29:43.983 --> 01:29:45.123]  He didn't even know I said that.
[01:29:45.883 --> 01:29:46.743]  We're on the same page.
[01:29:46.783 --> 01:29:48.244]  God bless you, Dr. Vieira.
[01:29:48.444 --> 01:29:49.024]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:53.408]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.328 --> 01:29:57.109]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.931 --> 01:30:06.712]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:30:07.112 --> 01:30:09.873]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:30:10.133 --> 01:30:12.474]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:15.175]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:30:15.195 --> 01:30:18.296]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:30:18.636 --> 01:30:23.178]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.

[01:33:17.762 --> 01:33:18.863]  Don't tread on me.
[01:33:21.186 --> 01:33:22.087]  Don't tread on me.
[01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:26.332]  Don't tread on me.
[01:33:28.314 --> 01:33:28.935]  Love it or leave it.
[01:33:32.028 --> 01:33:33.990]  The globalists have now signed petitions.
[01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.750]  I have them right here.
[01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:35.711]  We've got articles on it.
[01:33:35.751 --> 01:33:36.712]  Paul Watson has one.
[01:33:37.132 --> 01:33:41.976]  They're saying, arrest us, imprison us, strip us of citizenship, put us in labor camps.
[01:33:42.777 --> 01:33:45.359]  I mean, they're getting 20,000, 30,000 signatures for these.
[01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.281]  So we're seeing who the Democrats are.
[01:33:47.301 --> 01:33:49.122]  This is what socialists always do.
[01:33:49.242 --> 01:33:52.285]  Once things start imploding, they go, just put the workers in a camp.
[01:33:53.567 --> 01:33:55.888]  At first, it's make them come out and, you know, dig ditches.
[01:33:56.908 --> 01:33:58.869]  And it's all about nobody's running your life.
[01:33:58.949 --> 01:34:00.130]  I mean, we know where this leads.
[01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:01.530]  But the globalists don't care.
[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:03.191]  They want total domination.
[01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:07.852]  They want to start a civil war, marching the military and police off to confiscate our guns.
[01:34:08.093 --> 01:34:13.995]  Obama is certainly looking at, as the NRA documented and has now admitted, on banning all semi-autos.
[01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:19.617]  We've got to turn them in, because they don't want us to start a peaceful states' rights movement and restore the republic.
[01:34:19.817 --> 01:34:20.837]  They know you're waking up.
[01:34:21.017 --> 01:34:22.158]  They know Europe's waking up.
[01:34:22.538 --> 01:34:25.143]  This is a banking cartel takeover, as Ron Paul said.
[01:34:25.163 --> 01:34:31.796]  I'm going to play that clip in about 7-8 minutes after constitutional lawyer and advisor to Ron Paul, Edwin Vieira, leaves us.
[01:34:33.666 --> 01:34:37.068]  Doctor, I'm going to try to give you the floor because I'm so excited at this historical crest.
[01:34:37.868 --> 01:34:58.698]  Repeat to folks what you told me during the break about Ron Paul and the mantle, and where we're going, and that you concur, and that you're going to talk to him, and everybody else should, and we're going to get Bruce Fine, constitutional lawyer and advisor to Ron Paul on, Lou Rockwell, I'm going to call all his sources, I'm going to get a hold of Ron Paul, and I'm going to say now is the time
[01:34:59.358 --> 01:35:04.903]  To step into the leadership, to organize as your final, you know, incredible work.
[01:35:07.004 --> 01:35:09.086]  This is such a great work that we're talking about here.
[01:35:09.106 --> 01:35:13.990]  To build a foundation going into this tyranny of the resistance.
[01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:14.591]  This is it.
[01:35:14.911 --> 01:35:19.455]  I know Ron Paul, who's accepted the draft twice, will accept it a third time.
[01:35:20.195 --> 01:35:26.057]  And he has thrown some of the little minions out of Campaign for Liberty that were saying, don't talk about the New World Order.
[01:35:26.357 --> 01:35:28.218]  He has exposed the global government in his speech.
[01:35:28.618 --> 01:35:30.798]  Dr. Vieira, what is your battle plan?
[01:35:30.838 --> 01:35:31.819]  What is your idea?
[01:35:32.039 --> 01:35:41.342]  That's why we got you on, to get these ideas out, to set brush fires, and then to codify the plan based on our forbearer's successful operation.
[01:35:42.082 --> 01:35:48.984]  Well, as I said to you during the break, Alex, the first step is for Ron Paul to come forward and assume the mantle of leadership here.
[01:35:49.571 --> 01:35:59.042]  If you look at the parallel, the American independence movement, we had just paragons of intellectual and political virtue.
[01:35:59.222 --> 01:36:03.547]  The Jeffersons, the Adamses, the Patrick Henrys, even the Alexander Hamiltons.
[01:36:03.927 --> 01:36:07.011]  But there was one man who stood out and had to stand out.
[01:36:07.051 --> 01:36:08.833]  Of course, that was George Washington.
[01:36:09.534 --> 01:36:11.895]  And that's exactly what we need at this point in time.
[01:36:12.455 --> 01:36:14.476]  Here is the man of undoubted integrity.
[01:36:14.536 --> 01:36:20.018]  Here is the man who has been telling us and warning us about these problems, not just for years, but for decades.
[01:36:20.738 --> 01:36:30.342]  Here's the man who has proven right, and he needs to be the figure who stands in the forefront of this movement to restore the Constitutional Declaration of Independence.
[01:36:30.902 --> 01:36:31.963]  And then he needs to find
[01:36:34.381 --> 01:36:46.717]  Really, at the state level, more than anywhere else, I'm not so concerned about finding the media in Washington, D.C., but at the state level, leaders of that caliber with the integrity
[01:36:47.423 --> 01:37:01.577]  With the political acumen, with the willingness to take on this project, not simply because their own political careers might be advanced, because initially I think they won't be, but because the welfare of the American people will be advanced.
[01:37:02.137 --> 01:37:09.865]  And then he needs to bring in, with that group, a sizable number of advisors who have what I would call a
[01:37:10.903 --> 01:37:14.364]  A fair track record on these economic and political issues.
[01:37:14.845 --> 01:37:19.026]  If he wants to call on me as an advisor, I'll be perfectly willing to come forward and work with him.
[01:37:19.406 --> 01:37:25.909]  And I think that there are probably dozens or hundreds of others like me out in the country that would say and do exactly the same thing.
[01:37:26.029 --> 01:37:28.890]  But it needs his leadership.
[01:37:29.530 --> 01:37:31.651]  He is the national figure here.
[01:37:32.031 --> 01:37:38.653]  He is the one whom everyone on either side of the political yellow line, if you will, recognizes.
[01:37:38.673 --> 01:37:39.874]  They recognize him
[01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:40.912]  I don't know.
[01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:03.843]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:03.903 --> 01:38:04.103]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:34.372 --> 01:38:35.793]  I can feel history rising.
[01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.317]  I can feel the spirit of 1776 like I've never felt it, listeners.
[01:38:39.817 --> 01:38:40.378]  You know that.
[01:38:40.818 --> 01:38:45.462]  This is the most important broadcast we've ever done, and Dr. Vieira feels it.
[01:38:45.703 --> 01:38:46.623]  I feel it.
[01:38:46.663 --> 01:38:47.404]  You can see it.
[01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:49.746]  And here's what must be understood.
[01:38:49.946 --> 01:38:51.368]  Campaign for Liberty are great people.
[01:38:52.068 --> 01:38:59.856]  I've gotten mad at some of the folks there trying to play patty cake, some of the young men that have become political consultants for the mainline Republican Party.
[01:39:00.436 --> 01:39:09.102]  Folks that have married into the polls like Jesse Benton, people like Jack Hunter that are involved, who go out to eat with billionaires and kind of get stars in their eyes.
[01:39:09.562 --> 01:39:10.763]  They're not bad guys.
[01:39:11.123 --> 01:39:12.744]  They're just not Ron Paul.
[01:39:13.244 --> 01:39:15.686]  Rand Paul I've known for 15, 16 years.
[01:39:16.246 --> 01:39:18.028]  He used to come on and campaign for his dad.
[01:39:20.069 --> 01:39:20.929]  He's a good guy.
[01:39:20.949 --> 01:39:26.273]  He's just up there trying to position himself to be able to win the presidency later, and I get that.
[01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.154]  That's not going to happen, folks.
[01:39:28.554 --> 01:39:31.195]  In four years, in eight years, the globalists are going to win.
[01:39:31.755 --> 01:39:32.855]  Or it's going to be a civil war.
[01:39:33.435 --> 01:39:35.056]  We've got to be all in now, folks.
[01:39:35.236 --> 01:39:36.836]  That's why they're moving so fast.
[01:39:37.377 --> 01:39:38.397]  I've got three children.
[01:39:39.597 --> 01:39:43.279]  And I've got to sit there with my wife, who's extremely intelligent.
[01:39:43.859 --> 01:39:45.639]  And she has degrees in history.
[01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:48.981]  And she's like, OK, but we've got to get out of here.
[01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:50.061]  And she's lived all over the world.
[01:39:51.115 --> 01:39:55.158]  And her dad worked for the Department of Agriculture, and she's like, we got to get out of here.
[01:39:55.778 --> 01:39:58.260]  And I've got to say, no, we're putting it all on the line.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.180]  We're staying.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.482]  I've signed my name to the new Declaration of Independence.
[01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:02.743]  I'm all in, folks.
[01:40:03.423 --> 01:40:05.204]  I mean, I've got dirty tricks happening to me.
[01:40:05.244 --> 01:40:05.945]  You wouldn't believe.
[01:40:07.626 --> 01:40:08.487]  It's like a movie.
[01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:09.747]  And I'm just like, you know what?
[01:40:09.787 --> 01:40:10.308]  I'm all in.
[01:40:10.568 --> 01:40:12.149]  Because, folks, there's nowhere to run.
[01:40:12.429 --> 01:40:13.330]  This is history.
[01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:15.731]  And people that are scared, you don't understand.
[01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:17.733]  You should be scared of not taking action.
[01:40:18.573 --> 01:40:23.114]  And there are people in Campaign for Liberty who will say, oh, let's just work with the system.
[01:40:23.134 --> 01:40:24.175]  Let's take over the Republicans.
[01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:31.617]  And they have been getting people like Cruz elected over the neocon, you know, in the Senate here in Texas.
[01:40:31.637 --> 01:40:35.398]  They're getting a lot of good people in who, at least on the surface, are saying the right thing.
[01:40:35.458 --> 01:40:38.999]  So Campaign for Liberty, I've analyzed all this as Dr. Vieira is breaking down.
[01:40:39.319 --> 01:40:40.039]  He's analyzed it.
[01:40:40.339 --> 01:40:42.560]  Campaign for Liberty already knows who the good guys are in all the states.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.060]  It's already got all our money.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:44.561]  We gave it.
[01:40:44.981 --> 01:40:45.801]  It's got everything.
[01:40:46.341 --> 01:40:52.643]  It is the zenith, it is the launchpad, it is the fulcrum, it is the progenitor.
[01:40:53.243 --> 01:40:58.704]  As I said in the first hour, we're three years out, two to three years, we have to launch now.
[01:40:59.364 --> 01:41:08.547]  History is repeating itself and the entire globalist operation is designed to stop a states rights restoration movement that Dr. Vieira has laid out to Ron Paul.
[01:41:09.247 --> 01:41:15.736]  And again, Ron Paul gets his own ideas, historically, going to the same documents, but he sources Dr. Vieira and his battle plan.
[01:41:16.957 --> 01:41:19.881]  Dr. Fine, you know, both constitutional lawyers, PhDs.
[01:41:20.482 --> 01:41:21.103]  This is it.
[01:41:21.143 --> 01:41:26.450]  But I separately have gone and done the research, and it is incredible.
[01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:27.831]  Sir, thank you so much.
[01:41:27.871 --> 01:41:31.653]  I hope you'll come back very soon to really lay out some battle plans.
[01:41:31.693 --> 01:41:36.395]  I know you've already laid them out, but if you put out articles, it's articles that lay it out.
[01:41:36.435 --> 01:41:38.416]  We're writing an article that others can add to.
[01:41:38.457 --> 01:41:39.677]  I think we should all invade.
[01:41:40.318 --> 01:41:41.078]  Anybody can do it.
[01:41:41.798 --> 01:41:47.622]  Whitehouse.gov forward slash petitions and everyone should codify their own ideas of a restoration
[01:41:49.202 --> 01:41:51.283]  And we see the authoritarian lust.
[01:41:51.343 --> 01:41:53.424]  The Democrats want to get a civil war going.
[01:41:54.425 --> 01:41:56.426]  We need to reach out to the military and police now.
[01:41:56.766 --> 01:41:58.947]  This is a very perilous time we're in.
[01:41:59.587 --> 01:42:01.488]  And they're going to call us secessionists.
[01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:06.090]  So I just simply say restorationists, through the states, reconvening.
[01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:11.114]  America is the last bastion of human freedom in the world today.
[01:42:11.154 --> 01:42:12.435]  This is our responsibility as Americans.
[01:42:12.495 --> 01:42:16.538]  And my view has always been we need to take action immediately, if not sooner.
[01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.337]  We can't wait for Rand Paul.
[01:42:38.457 --> 01:42:41.639]  Do you agree we don't have four to eight years to play patty cake with the Republicans?
[01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:46.401]  No, because the economic freight train is coming down the tracks at us at a very high velocity.
[01:42:46.441 --> 01:42:47.301]  We can't avoid that.
[01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:52.703]  And what will be the political consequences of a complete breakup of the international banking system?
[01:42:53.844 --> 01:42:56.785]  And they're going to use that meltdown as a way to... Absolutely.
[01:42:56.905 --> 01:42:58.406]  They'll try to use it for their benefit.
[01:42:59.122 --> 01:42:59.222]  Now!
[01:42:59.242 --> 01:42:59.323]  Now!
[01:43:12.858 --> 01:43:15.900]  I pledge myself, doctor, to you and Dr. Paul.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:20.383]  I pledge myself to my family before God on the altar of liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:43:20.743 --> 01:43:25.346]  I swear eternal resistance to every form of tyranny over the mind of humankind.
[01:43:25.746 --> 01:43:27.947]  And I know you pledge with me now on the listeners pledge.
[01:43:28.287 --> 01:43:29.568]  We aren't going to stop.
[01:43:29.828 --> 01:43:31.189]  We're drafting Ron Paul.
[01:43:31.429 --> 01:43:33.070]  We're drafting all liberty lovers.
[01:43:33.330 --> 01:43:34.911]  Go to your state houses now.
[01:43:35.352 --> 01:43:35.972]  Go visit
[01:43:36.332 --> 01:43:36.672]  Absolutely.
[01:43:36.692 --> 01:43:38.474]  I've been doing that for a long time now.
[01:43:38.494 --> 01:43:39.455]  That's right.
[01:43:39.475 --> 01:43:41.396]  We have our work cut out for us.
[01:43:41.456 --> 01:43:42.417]  What's the old saying?
[01:43:42.437 --> 01:43:45.119]  When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
[01:44:04.076 --> 01:44:05.477]  It's always darkest before the dawn.
[01:44:06.317 --> 01:44:08.518]  It had to get bad before people get up.
[01:44:08.838 --> 01:44:09.259]  That's right.
[01:44:10.239 --> 01:44:11.060]  And now is the time.
[01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:15.462]  And they want to start the Civil War with a gun confiscation.
[01:44:15.502 --> 01:44:18.924]  We've got a race now to accelerate our operations against them.
[01:44:18.964 --> 01:44:21.325]  It may be able to back them off in biased time.
[01:44:21.365 --> 01:44:26.408]  But, sir, I know there's a lot of sites that post your great articles, your books, your materials.
[01:44:26.428 --> 01:44:29.009]  Where's the best place to find your information?
[01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:32.033]  Right now, it's at newswithviews.com.
[01:44:32.153 --> 01:44:35.317]  One word, newswithviews.com.
[01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:35.818]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:35.918 --> 01:44:36.639]  Excellent material.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:43.168]  All right, we've got our work cut out, but the tide in the affairs of men, when taken at the flood, leads on to liberty.
[01:44:43.208 --> 01:44:43.869]  God bless you, sir.
[01:44:44.110 --> 01:44:44.650]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:44:44.751 --> 01:44:45.011]  Bye-bye.
[01:44:45.433 --> 01:44:47.294]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:49.815]  And again, now is the time.
[01:44:49.976 --> 01:44:51.296]  Now is the time.
[01:44:51.436 --> 01:44:52.717]  Now is the time.
[01:44:52.917 --> 01:44:54.778]  I do not have words to describe.
[01:44:54.798 --> 01:44:56.779]  We're going to cover it more on the nightly news tonight.
[01:44:56.799 --> 01:44:58.200]  We're going to cover it more tomorrow.
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.381]  On the Sunday show, I'll be live.
[01:44:59.401 --> 01:45:00.982]  I'm going to play large excerpts of this.
[01:45:01.542 --> 01:45:08.045]  I want to play a particularly powerful part of the 49-minute speech that Ron Paul gave on the House floor.
[01:45:08.065 --> 01:45:10.267]  He called it questions.
[01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:14.766]  Excessive government has created such a... It prompts many questions.
[01:45:14.806 --> 01:45:15.606]  He goes through those.
[01:45:15.646 --> 01:45:16.587]  We'll go to break with that.
[01:45:17.027 --> 01:45:21.549]  Then we're going to come back with his conclusion how we've been conquered by world government.
[01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:25.730]  Only admitting we've been conquered fraudulently.
[01:45:26.230 --> 01:45:28.591]  You gotta admit you're a slave before you start becoming free.
[01:45:29.972 --> 01:45:32.733]  And let me tell you, the greatest honor I've ever had.
[01:45:32.773 --> 01:45:33.553]  The greatest treasure.
[01:45:34.665 --> 01:45:47.431]  Even above my children, because they have no future if we don't win, is that God saw fit to take a wretch like me and to rise me up in all the things that happen in my life to prepare me for this moment of what we're beginning now.
[01:45:47.511 --> 01:45:48.712]  The bell cannot be unrung.
[01:45:49.212 --> 01:45:54.475]  To know with surety that we're going to win if God be with us who can stand against us.
[01:45:56.116 --> 01:46:00.658]  And it's time for everyone who's in thought and everything else to repent before God
[01:46:02.142 --> 01:46:04.364]  I even repent for nasty things I've said about Glenn Beck.
[01:46:04.404 --> 01:46:06.166]  I should have responded to him more gentlemanly.
[01:46:06.206 --> 01:46:09.268]  I apologize for when he said bad things about me being worldly.
[01:46:09.609 --> 01:46:10.649]  We don't have time for this.
[01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:12.991]  We don't have time to fight with each other anymore.
[01:46:13.072 --> 01:46:16.595]  We don't have time for all this petty stuff.
[01:46:16.635 --> 01:46:18.396]  We have got to come together.
[01:46:18.897 --> 01:46:19.437]  All of us.
[01:46:20.118 --> 01:46:21.899]  So I repent for my trespasses.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.340]  Do you repent for yours?
[01:46:23.521 --> 01:46:24.581]  All of my enemies out there.
[01:46:25.515 --> 01:46:26.896]  Please come in for the big win.
[01:46:27.757 --> 01:46:29.578]  Please realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:46:29.598 --> 01:46:30.799]  Realize how much danger we're in.
[01:46:31.079 --> 01:46:32.400]  These globalists are dangerous.
[01:46:36.243 --> 01:46:37.824]  We have to get involved now.
[01:46:37.904 --> 01:46:39.806]  We have to get aggressive now.
[01:46:40.146 --> 01:46:42.488]  We have to go out and wake up everybody we can now.
[01:46:42.788 --> 01:46:45.430]  And then we come back in the next segment, his conclusion.
[01:46:47.131 --> 01:46:49.713]  You know, we've put, with this show, eugenics back on the map.
[01:46:49.773 --> 01:46:52.555]  We've put the fact that we're conquered on the map with that nomenclature.
[01:46:52.615 --> 01:46:53.055]  The truth!
[01:46:53.576 --> 01:46:54.697]  The truth will set us free!
[01:46:56.624 --> 01:46:58.005]  Admit how far we've fallen!
[01:46:58.065 --> 01:46:59.626]  Admit how pathetic we've gotten!
[01:47:00.026 --> 01:47:01.507]  Only then can we rise again!
[01:47:01.527 --> 01:47:06.370]  And Ron Paul is now getting more hardcore, because that's all he can do.
[01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:13.715]  Now that Ron Paul's leaving Congress, now that his son's in the Senate, all this, Ron Paul, it's time to come out both barrels.
[01:47:14.435 --> 01:47:17.277]  I know you're a man after my own heart.
[01:47:17.937 --> 01:47:19.418]  I know you know what I know.
[01:47:20.439 --> 01:47:21.219]  Say it all!
[01:47:21.439 --> 01:47:22.100]  Lay it out!
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.402]  Throw yourself against the New World Order, and all of us will as well.
[01:47:28.089 --> 01:47:33.630]  And let all the rest of the Campaign for Liberty establishment types that have infiltrated, let them hit the streets.
[01:47:33.650 --> 01:47:35.151]  They're already getting their big Republican jobs.
[01:47:35.511 --> 01:47:36.871]  I know you've purged them.
[01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:37.751]  Good!
[01:47:38.912 --> 01:47:39.272]  Good!
[01:47:39.592 --> 01:47:41.032]  Because there is no future now.
[01:47:41.532 --> 01:47:42.052]  All in!
[01:47:43.253 --> 01:47:44.433]  Here's part of Ron Paul's speech.
[01:47:44.453 --> 01:47:45.953]  We'll go to break and finish up with the rest of it.
[01:47:45.973 --> 01:47:50.434]  Here he is saying some questions, and he lists the incredible tyranny we're under, and I have some other points.
[01:47:50.454 --> 01:47:50.794]  Here it is.
[01:47:50.814 --> 01:47:52.475]  I have a few questions.
[01:47:52.795 --> 01:47:56.856]  Excessive government has created such a mess, it prompts many questions.
[01:47:58.095 --> 01:48:03.340]  Why are sick people who use medical marijuana put in prison?
[01:48:04.421 --> 01:48:07.964]  Why does the federal government restrict the drinking of raw milk?
[01:48:08.785 --> 01:48:14.290]  Why can't American manufacturers rope and other products from hemp?
[01:48:15.452 --> 01:48:21.097]  Why are Americans not allowed to use gold and silver as legal tender as mandated by the Constitution?
[01:48:21.815 --> 01:48:28.360]  Why is Germany concerned enough to consider repatriating their gold held by the Fed for her in New York?
[01:48:29.601 --> 01:48:33.984]  Is it that the trust in the US and dollar supremacy beginning to wane?
[01:48:34.845 --> 01:48:39.429]  Why do our political leaders believe it's unnecessary to thoroughly audit our own gold?
[01:48:39.469 --> 01:48:42.171]  Why can't Americans decide which type of light bulbs they can buy?
[01:48:49.674 --> 01:48:55.738]  Why is it the TSA permitted to abuse the rights of any American traveling by air?
[01:48:56.618 --> 01:49:03.182]  Why should there be mandatory sentences even up to life for crimes without victims as our drug laws require?
[01:49:04.783 --> 01:49:08.825]  Why have we allowed the federal government to regulate commodes in our homes?
[01:49:09.526 --> 01:49:13.128]  Why is it political suicide for anyone to criticize AIPAC?
[01:49:14.105 --> 01:49:19.929]  Why haven't we given up on the drug war since it's an obvious failure and violates the people's rights?
[01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:26.092]  Has nobody noticed that the authorities can't even keep drugs out of the prisons?
[01:49:26.773 --> 01:49:30.755]  How can making our entire society a prison solve the problem?
[01:49:31.635 --> 01:49:39.140]  Why do we sacrifice so much getting necessarily involved in border disputes and civil strife around the world
[01:49:39.861 --> 01:49:46.967]  And ignore the root cause of the most dangerous, deadly border in the world, the one between Mexico and the United States.
[01:49:47.907 --> 01:49:52.911]  Why does Congress willingly give up its prerogatives to the executive branch?
[01:49:53.592 --> 01:49:57.675]  Why is changing the party in power never a change policy?
[01:49:58.376 --> 01:50:01.398]  Could it be that the views of both parties are essentially the same?
[01:50:02.176 --> 01:50:12.327]  Why did the big banks, the large corporations, and foreign central banks get bailed out in 2008, and the middle class lost their jobs and their homes?
[01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:20.977]  Why do so many in the government and the federal officials believe that creating money out of thin air creates wealth?
[01:50:21.952 --> 01:50:32.464]  Why do so many accept the deeply flawed principle that government bureaucrats and politicians can protect us from ourselves without totally destroying the principle of liberty?
[01:50:33.348 --> 01:50:39.230]  Folks, we're going to come back and finish up the Y part of this, and then we're going to get to the most powerful.
[01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:44.632]  The whole thing, though, he says we have a cancerous group of psychopaths, that's a quote, running things.
[01:50:44.692 --> 01:50:45.632]  I mean, he lays it all out.
[01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:47.033]  World government, we're conquered.
[01:50:47.433 --> 01:50:50.934]  It is unbelievable 49 minutes.
[01:50:51.415 --> 01:50:53.415]  And we're just going to cover it and cover it and cover it.
[01:50:54.516 --> 01:50:56.056]  Ron Paul is standing up.
[01:50:56.556 --> 01:50:58.477]  I mean, it's time to go 110% into the eye of the enemy.
[01:51:01.198 --> 01:51:07.225]  Many conservatives believe the 2012 election was a disaster and hope 2016 will turn out much better.
[01:51:07.405 --> 01:51:15.194]  But even before he was re-elected, one of the country's most widely circulated newspapers discussed how our Commander-in-Chief could seek a third term.
[01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:21.001]  And one Maryland-based analyst says it's a lot more likely than most Americans think, in fact.
[01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:32.148]  He spent the past six months uncovering the details of a shocking event set to take place during Obama's second term, which could essentially enable Obama to extend his presidency for a third term.
[01:51:32.448 --> 01:51:36.031]  This would ultimately make him one of the most powerful presidents in U.S.
[01:51:36.091 --> 01:51:38.092]  history, a rival to FDR.
[01:51:38.312 --> 01:51:44.596]  This analyst believes it will change the course of our nation's future and profoundly affect the very well-being of you and your family.

[01:52:01.072 --> 01:52:04.194]  Being an armed citizen means having a gun with you all the time.
[01:52:04.915 --> 01:52:09.739]  Carrying a firearm every day requires a holster that is both concealable and comfortable.
[01:52:10.359 --> 01:52:19.466]  Whether you choose our Super Tuck Deluxe or Mini Tuck, you'll have the confidence that comes from being discreetly and comfortably armed, prepared to face unforeseen dangers.

[01:52:30.595 --> 01:52:31.655]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:31.835 --> 01:52:36.176]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:36.356 --> 01:52:42.017]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:42.117 --> 01:52:45.518]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:52:45.718 --> 01:52:48.319]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:48.419 --> 01:52:53.280]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:53.660]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:55.080]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:01.184 --> 01:53:08.074]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming disaster and may not survive without?
[01:53:08.935 --> 01:53:11.959]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S.
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:13.521]  and you have got to be prepared.
[01:53:14.062 --> 01:53:18.028]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[01:53:18.468 --> 01:53:30.275]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain, or even a hint of a crisis, then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes, and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[01:53:30.675 --> 01:53:40.521]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now, before it's too late.
[01:53:41.081 --> 01:53:50.309]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after a disaster and may not survive without.
[01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:56.313]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[01:53:56.794 --> 01:53:57.935]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[01:54:03.056 --> 01:54:11.781]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:54:12.562 --> 01:54:13.582]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:54:14.143 --> 01:54:17.905]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:18.986 --> 01:54:22.267]  Make no mistake, my friends, you are living history.
[01:54:23.728 --> 01:54:25.930]  And I can't believe they have national talk show hosts.
[01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:27.711]  Not just one, but multiple ones now.
[01:54:30.547 --> 01:54:33.869]  Openly saying, don't sign petitions, they'll put you on a list, they'll come get you.
[01:54:34.369 --> 01:54:35.070]  Come get me!
[01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:37.672]  The war has already begun.
[01:54:39.152 --> 01:54:40.093]  It's an info war.
[01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:43.335]  The enemy wants to make it physical.
[01:54:43.815 --> 01:54:44.836]  Strike me down!
[01:54:45.216 --> 01:54:48.758]  I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine in the idea.
[01:54:49.399 --> 01:54:51.300]  I'm not gonna live as a slave, okay?
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.541]  I mean, these globalists are nasty folks.
[01:54:53.641 --> 01:54:54.602]  These are eugenicists.
[01:54:55.122 --> 01:54:57.264]  They've got a covert war going on against us.
[01:54:58.556 --> 01:55:01.999]  An undeclared secret war with the chemicals and biologicals in our food and water.
[01:55:02.199 --> 01:55:03.040]  We're far gone.
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.102]  We need to get back in their face.
[01:55:06.343 --> 01:55:09.665]  All of you people that serve the system, you're victims as well, you fools.
[01:55:11.587 --> 01:55:15.810]  We've got a breakaway civilization of technocrats that think they're going to be able to take everything over.
[01:55:17.392 --> 01:55:18.152]  Man, we're in trouble.
[01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:26.116]  Why did large banks, large corporations, and foreign banks, and foreign central banks get bailed out in 2008, and the middle class lost their jobs and their homes?
[01:55:26.496 --> 01:55:35.263]  Let's continue with this, out the rest of this segment, then coming up, after Lew Rockwell, and others, I'm gonna play about five minutes where he has his summation.
[01:55:35.603 --> 01:55:38.025]  And boy, he breaks down that we're under global government!
[01:55:38.726 --> 01:55:41.068]  Unelected global government, run by eugenicists.
[01:55:41.468 --> 01:55:43.750]  Let's go ahead and go back to his questions.
[01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:44.290]  Here it is.
[01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:47.573]  Without totally destroying the principle of liberty,
[01:55:48.433 --> 01:55:52.254]  Why can't people understand that war always destroys wealth and liberty?
[01:55:53.054 --> 01:56:04.897]  Why is there so little concern for the executive order that gives the president authority to establish a kill list, including American citizens, of those targeted for assassination?
[01:56:06.077 --> 01:56:16.299]  Why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run it, rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people?
[01:56:17.097 --> 01:56:22.201]  Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong.
[01:56:23.241 --> 01:56:30.586]  Why is it claimed that if people won't or can't take care of their own needs that people in government are able to do it for them?
[01:56:32.007 --> 01:56:38.732]  Why did we ever give the government a safe haven for initiating violence against the people?
[01:56:39.712 --> 01:56:43.395]  Why do so many members defend free markets but not civil liberties?
[01:56:44.276 --> 01:56:46.177]  Why do so many members defend civil liberties
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:48.020]  But not free markets.
[01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:49.561]  Aren't they the same?
[01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:54.482]  Why don't more defend both economic liberty and personal liberty?
[01:56:55.203 --> 01:57:04.366]  Why are there not more individuals who seek to intellectually influence others to bring about positive changes than those who seek power to force others to obey their commands?
[01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:20.600]  Why does the use of religion to support a social gospel and preemptive wars, both of which require authoritarians to use violence or the threat of violence, go unchallenged?
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:28.486]  Aggression and forced redistribution of wealth has nothing to do with the teachings of the world's great religions.
[01:57:29.787 --> 01:57:36.453]  Why do we allow the government and the Federal Reserve to disseminate false information dealing with both economic and foreign policy?
[01:57:37.552 --> 01:57:50.657]  Why is democracy held in such high esteem when it's the enemy of the minority and makes all rights relative to the dictates of the majority?
[01:57:51.478 --> 01:57:59.421]  Why should anyone be surprised that Congress has no credibility since there's such a disconnect between what politicians say and what they do?
[01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:09.675]  Is there any explanation for all the deception, the unhappiness, the fear of the future, the loss of confidence in our leaders, the distrust and the anger and frustration?
[01:58:09.695 --> 01:58:10.215]  Yes, there is.
[01:58:10.555 --> 01:58:11.536]  Because we're under great evil.
[01:58:11.596 --> 01:58:12.196]  Yes, there is.
[01:58:12.697 --> 01:58:14.518]  And there's a way to reverse these attitudes.
[01:58:14.758 --> 01:58:15.859]  Alright, we're going to break.
[01:58:15.879 --> 01:58:18.601]  When we come back, we are going to have Lou Rockwell on.
[01:58:18.621 --> 01:58:23.924]  No, actually we have Porter Stansbury on to break down what's happening in the economy, then Lou Rockwell.
[01:58:24.465 --> 01:58:27.927]  But I will continue with clips from this as well, even when Lou Rockwell is on with us.
[01:58:31.209 --> 01:58:32.191]  Here's the deal, folks.
[01:58:32.691 --> 01:58:34.273]  We're going into total bondage.
[01:58:34.414 --> 01:58:38.119]  It's pre-planned, and Ron Paul talks about that in his speech as well.
[01:58:41.663 --> 01:58:42.725]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:08.075 --> 01:59:11.257]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:59:11.517 --> 01:59:12.957]  There's no priming required.
[01:59:13.217 --> 01:59:15.238]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:59:15.478 --> 01:59:17.959]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:59:19.039 --> 01:59:20.380]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.860]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.842]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:59:25.162 --> 01:59:28.323]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:59:28.544 --> 01:59:30.324]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:59:30.444 --> 01:59:32.526]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:59:32.686 --> 01:59:35.287]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:59:35.427 --> 01:59:36.728]  It's what my family uses.
[01:59:36.988 --> 01:59:40.189]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:59:40.309 --> 01:59:45.872]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[01:59:49.316 --> 01:59:55.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.406 --> 01:59:59.169]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.816 --> 02:00:09.999]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.241 --> 02:00:13.162]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.782 --> 02:00:17.385]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.966 --> 02:00:22.029]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.746 --> 02:00:45.248]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we have a record audience we can see at InfoWars.com and also on the audio streams.
[02:00:45.328 --> 02:00:50.209]  So I would imagine it's like that on XM and on our 140 plus AM and FM affiliates right now.
[02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:55.671]  I've been really trying to get him on for a while and he said he had 30 minutes with us today.
[02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:58.792]  Whatever he talks about in this short segment, we'll recap in the next.
[02:00:58.872 --> 02:01:02.393]  But Porter Stansbury, you know, he predicted they'd go into QE3.
[02:01:02.553 --> 02:01:03.373]  They're now starting it.
[02:01:04.473 --> 02:01:17.886]  He predicted so much of what was going to happen in the last decade, and he is now predicting right now, well, that it's in the mainstream news that they're going to try to push for a third term for Obama in the mass depression they're going to engineer.
[02:01:18.747 --> 02:01:23.411]  And so we're going to be looking at that a lot more and where he sees the future of this country.
[02:01:23.491 --> 02:01:26.414]  I'll give you his bio more in the next segment.
[02:01:26.454 --> 02:01:28.095]  But, Porter, great to have you back with us.
[02:01:28.596 --> 02:01:29.396]  It's always a pleasure.
[02:01:29.416 --> 02:01:29.997]  Thanks for having me.
[02:01:31.058 --> 02:01:34.600]  I know you create special websites for different projects.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:42.443]  What is the best website for people to go to where you have the proof and the information that they're trying to move in this direction?
[02:01:43.223 --> 02:01:45.524]  It's thirdterm1.com.
[02:01:53.106 --> 02:01:57.331]  Well, we've got that site up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:01:57.351 --> 02:01:58.333]  We'll continue to give it out.
[02:01:59.674 --> 02:02:08.345]  I want to get into the economy with you, but coming up, what are you going to be able to break down for folks with what's happening dealing with the economy?
[02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:16.043]  Well, from the economy standpoint, I've got some numbers for you on these supposed efforts to cut the spending and things like that.
[02:02:16.123 --> 02:02:16.664]  I'll show you.
[02:02:16.684 --> 02:02:18.546]  There's no way they're going to be able to do it.
[02:02:19.507 --> 02:02:29.018]  And in regards to Obama's third term, I'd really like people to see that there's a connection between something that's going on in the oil business and presidential politics.
[02:02:32.236 --> 02:02:39.002]  Continuing as well, QE Unlimited has begun and they are talking about all these major currencies going down.
[02:02:39.022 --> 02:02:42.986]  Will people even notice if the big event accelerates?
[02:02:44.367 --> 02:02:52.314]  I think people are definitely going to notice the fact that their purchasing power is being eliminated by the ongoing inflation that the government refuses to recognize.
[02:02:54.926 --> 02:02:59.948]  The website, folks, if you want to see the breakdown, the video presentation is www.3rdterm1.com.
[02:02:59.988 --> 02:03:03.109]  That's the number 3, just the numeral 3, just 3rdterm1.com.
[02:03:12.512 --> 02:03:17.534]  That is the best way for people to find that URL.
[02:03:17.994 --> 02:03:34.001]  And I do think we should discuss this because if we don't discuss the fact that Democratic operatives are in newspapers that you point out in your presentation up on the site, if we don't point out that they're pushing this and that they're trying to float the idea like they did with Schwarzenegger to change the 22nd Amendment so he can run for president, they're going to end up doing it.
[02:03:34.361 --> 02:03:37.162]  I mean, he just signed an executive order today and made it secret.
[02:03:37.842 --> 02:03:39.566]  What his new cybersecurity takeover is.
[02:03:39.586 --> 02:03:40.709]  But we know what the bill was.
[02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:44.758]  Even CBS News said it's a takeover of the internet, Chinese-style control.
[02:03:46.434 --> 02:04:09.811]  Yeah, well, if you just look and see what he's been doing to win these elections by ramping up the enormous amounts of spending that the government's giving directly to individuals, $750 billion now on welfare programs that go directly to individuals, food stamp rolls that have increased by 50% in his presidency,
[02:04:11.392 --> 02:04:16.116]  If you take just those people who get food stamps, that's like 75% of the people that voted for him.
[02:04:17.697 --> 02:04:27.544]  He and the Democratic Party are engineering these election victories, and I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that he could find a way to engineer the repeal of the 22nd Amendment.
[02:04:28.004 --> 02:04:33.267]  But even if he doesn't do that, Alex, that doesn't necessarily mean that he won't have a third term.
[02:04:33.788 --> 02:04:37.210]  He could have a proxy, and that's one of the things I talk about.
[02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:45.295]  He could put up Eric Holder, for example, to be the next president while he actually remains in control of the administration, much like Putin has done in Russia.
[02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:49.154]  Oh yeah, Putin with Medvedev, and then he came back again.
[02:04:49.174 --> 02:04:51.436]  Medvedev, oh he's a trouble pronouncing it.
[02:04:51.777 --> 02:04:57.864]  Horace Tansbury, incredible mind, writer, researcher, investment strategist.
[02:04:57.984 --> 02:04:59.646]  We'll be right back with him on the other side of this break.
[02:04:59.666 --> 02:05:00.027]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.922 --> 02:05:03.703]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.984 --> 02:05:05.664]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:09.266]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[02:05:09.586 --> 02:05:11.667]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:05:11.787 --> 02:05:15.209]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:05:15.429 --> 02:05:21.232]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:05:21.512 --> 02:05:24.854]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:25.214 --> 02:05:29.821]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:05:29.961 --> 02:05:35.689]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:36.991]  And here's the best news.

[02:07:04.892 --> 02:07:06.313]  Make sure you're not one of them.

[02:07:32.415 --> 02:07:42.146]  It is non-toxic and is proven to be effective against many of the most serious diseases out there today, such as resistant staph, strep, pneumonia, viruses and flus.
[02:07:42.606 --> 02:07:48.630]  Supernatural Silver is a safe and effective way to fight pathogens where antibiotics and other drugs fail.

[02:08:01.397 --> 02:08:09.222]  You've got a business.
[02:08:09.862 --> 02:08:10.963]  You didn't build that.
[02:08:12.012 --> 02:08:13.594]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:08:21.183 --> 02:08:27.390]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.527 --> 02:08:37.390]  I love what wimps the average Democratic Party operative is and their minions and people.
[02:08:37.431 --> 02:08:44.574]  I mean it really is shameful to watch as now a million three hundred thousand and counting people have signed petitions.
[02:08:44.634 --> 02:08:46.475]  All 50 states are about to qualify.
[02:08:46.715 --> 02:08:53.819]  Last time I checked it's like 20 states have now qualified to have to get a White House response because of the number of petitions to secede.
[02:08:53.919 --> 02:08:54.899]  But people don't really know.
[02:08:55.239 --> 02:08:57.180]  You don't go to the whitehouse.gov to secede.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.141]  You go to your legislature.
[02:08:58.701 --> 02:09:00.703]  I'm not calling for the classical secession.
[02:09:00.963 --> 02:09:02.344]  The federal government's been taken over.
[02:09:03.405 --> 02:09:07.928]  And so I'm saying have the states get together and organize and say, hold your horses.
[02:09:08.408 --> 02:09:09.429]  You're out of control.
[02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:11.411]  We want to restore the republic.
[02:09:11.631 --> 02:09:16.134]  I mean, the foreign banks brag they've conquered this country, just like they brag they've conquered European nations.
[02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:18.216]  And Porter Stansbury predicted all of this.
[02:09:18.276 --> 02:09:19.277]  Lou Rockwell's coming up.
[02:09:21.258 --> 02:09:26.805]  They are now threatening people and he's got an article posted at LewRockwell.com saying don't do this or you're going to regret it.
[02:09:27.606 --> 02:09:31.131]  And they've got their operatives in conservative media saying don't sign those petitions.
[02:09:31.471 --> 02:09:34.134]  It's your right to say we want to secede from this federal thing.
[02:09:34.675 --> 02:09:38.300]  Whether it's unsophisticated or not, it's people voicing their concern.
[02:09:39.639 --> 02:09:43.965]  So Lou Rockwell is coming up more on Ron Paul's speech where he says world government's taking us over.
[02:09:44.766 --> 02:09:50.192]  Porter Stansbury founded Stansbury and Associates Investment Research, a private publishing company based in Baltimore, Maryland in 99.
[02:09:50.553 --> 02:09:53.657]  His monthly newsletter, Stansbury Investment Advisory, is one of the biggest in the world.
[02:09:54.218 --> 02:09:54.878]  Deals with safe...
[02:09:55.399 --> 02:09:55.659]  Thank you.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.440]  Third term won.
[02:10:27.881 --> 02:10:30.422]  The numbers are just, you know, single numbers, not spelled out.
[02:10:30.803 --> 02:10:32.144]  3rd term won.
[02:10:32.464 --> 02:10:33.705]  3rd term won.
[02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:41.670]  And I gotta say, yeah, they are floating articles everywhere saying in the news right now, hey, Obama should run for a third term.
[02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:46.113]  We're gonna do this, the latest on the economy, QE3, what he sees happening.
[02:10:46.133 --> 02:10:47.314]  But first I gotta ask you, Porter,
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:11:02.429]  What do you make of them saying, you didn't build it, we're going to bankrupt America, we're going to confiscate all semi-automatic rifles and handguns, and Democrats are really saying, hey, let's start arresting people, and you're racist if you don't like world government.
[02:11:02.509 --> 02:11:05.851]  I mean, this is even nastier than I thought it would be.
[02:11:06.172 --> 02:11:06.932]  This is crazy.
[02:11:06.972 --> 02:11:09.334]  I mean, why do you think they're trying to totally take over right now?
[02:11:10.595 --> 02:11:15.318]  I think, you know, I think they believe that they have the votes, that they have the power, the people behind them.
[02:11:16.141 --> 02:11:30.485]  And I think if you look at what's going on in our country, this idea of class warfare has really materialized, where you have half of the people that voted for Obama receiving enormous direct federal handouts.
[02:11:32.146 --> 02:11:45.650]  The Democratic Party has perfected this machine that buys elections, and they're going to see how far they can take that, because it doesn't look like the Republicans can get organized enough to stop them.
[02:11:47.978 --> 02:11:50.161]  Well, that's because they're part of the same globalist system.
[02:11:50.201 --> 02:11:53.205]  Where do you think the power structure is trying to take us, Porter?
[02:11:54.968 --> 02:11:59.073]  Well, just look at, you know, just sort of look what's going on around the country.
[02:11:59.494 --> 02:12:04.861]  You have the highest amount of dependence on the government in the history of the United States.
[02:12:05.954 --> 02:12:10.116]  At the same time, you have the federal government beginning to break apart financially.
[02:12:10.636 --> 02:12:13.997]  Let me throw this number out at you, Alex, and you tell me where it leads.
[02:12:14.777 --> 02:12:18.239]  Right now, the federal government is spending $55,000 per household in the United States.
[02:12:18.259 --> 02:12:20.200]  There are 114 million households.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:23.321]  They're spending $55,000 per household on government in the United States right now.
[02:12:32.495 --> 02:12:36.279]  The average income per household is only $50,000 in the United States.
[02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:38.402]  Does that make any sense?
[02:12:38.602 --> 02:12:43.287]  Is there any country in the world that can spend more on government than it earns in income?
[02:12:43.948 --> 02:12:46.250]  It leads towards designed implosion.
[02:12:46.991 --> 02:12:50.734]  And the weekly standard said it's 61,000 breaking down congressional numbers.
[02:12:50.754 --> 02:12:55.518]  But let's just say 55,000 the average welfare household is getting.
[02:12:56.759 --> 02:12:58.841]  And they are bringing us into debt servitude.
[02:12:58.921 --> 02:13:02.404]  They are de-industrializing the country under agenda 21.
[02:13:02.444 --> 02:13:07.648]  We are being conquered just like Stalin conquered Ukraine by turning off the economy.
[02:13:12.046 --> 02:13:21.091]  I just look at the numbers side of things, and I can't find any plausible reason that either party would run the country this way.
[02:13:21.711 --> 02:13:37.479]  They're dooming generations of Americans to poverty and dependence, and they're doing it by bribing these ignorant voters who will believe anything they read and will do whatever they have to do to get a free book.
[02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:38.931]  That's worse than that.
[02:13:39.151 --> 02:13:42.054]  More and more Democrats, and they talk about it on all the shows.
[02:13:42.094 --> 02:13:43.115]  Bill Maher talks about it.
[02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:46.618]  They say they're going to just arrest us and put us in forced labor camps.
[02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:47.779]  I'm not joking.
[02:13:47.799 --> 02:13:49.120]  That's in the new Army manuals.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:56.547]  I mean, they're going to come literally put us on Plantations Porter and let big fat government slobs beat our brains out, rape our wives.
[02:13:56.587 --> 02:13:58.609]  I mean, that's really... I'm not kidding.
[02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:59.310]  That's what they want to do.
[02:14:00.066 --> 02:14:02.209]  Well, they're not going to do that to me, Alex.
[02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:05.414]  I'm prepared to leave if things turn out like that.
[02:14:05.494 --> 02:14:05.875]  No, no, no.
[02:14:05.935 --> 02:14:08.158]  But listen, I want listeners to know I'm not joking.
[02:14:08.439 --> 02:14:10.302]  They are licking their lips.
[02:14:10.722 --> 02:14:11.744]  Misery loves company.
[02:14:11.944 --> 02:14:14.689]  They just want to wreck and just decimate everything.
[02:14:15.168 --> 02:14:18.329]  I mean, this is what happens in every other country, and look at how decadent we are.
[02:14:18.869 --> 02:14:20.530]  Ron Paul talked about it in his farewell speech.
[02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:22.971]  He said, we are incredibly immoral and evil.
[02:14:23.191 --> 02:14:26.492]  We are run by authoritarian psychopaths.
[02:14:27.053 --> 02:14:30.514]  I mean, let me tell you, we cannot underestimate, Porter, how bad it's going to get.
[02:14:31.357 --> 02:14:44.950]  I agree with you completely on the economic side of things, and I thought that Ron Paul's farewell speech was the most poignant political speech I have seen in our country since George Washington's farewell address.
[02:14:44.970 --> 02:14:51.316]  That should be mandatory for every American to watch and to listen and to think about.
[02:14:51.816 --> 02:15:02.348]  He's the only political leader in the United States who is willing to tell Americans the truth about our government, which is one, that we're financially bankrupt, and two, that we're morally bankrupt.
[02:15:03.797 --> 02:15:04.998]  America is dead.
[02:15:05.578 --> 02:15:09.481]  Basically, Dr. Paul, but we're not physical.
[02:15:09.521 --> 02:15:10.441]  We can be resurrected.
[02:15:10.481 --> 02:15:11.202]  But we're dead.
[02:15:11.302 --> 02:15:11.722]  It's over.
[02:15:11.782 --> 02:15:12.603]  We're far gone.
[02:15:13.563 --> 02:15:15.344]  By design, we've been conquered.
[02:15:15.784 --> 02:15:17.445]  And now we're about to be de-industrialized.
[02:15:17.506 --> 02:15:21.468]  Porter, break down what you think Obama's planning from his own operative statements.
[02:15:21.908 --> 02:15:24.390]  During the implosion, he'll be the FDR that saves us.
[02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:26.071]  Break that down and stay in office.
[02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:39.674]  Well, you know, Alex, I think the one thing that's going on in our country right now that could delay the fiscal implosion is the renaissance in the oil and gas industry in America.
[02:15:39.774 --> 02:15:47.037]  It's very powerful, it's very real, and it's going to produce a lot more revenue and a lot more power for politicians.
[02:15:47.957 --> 02:15:48.858]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:16:07.878 --> 02:16:10.200]  In 1901, there was an oil boom from Spindletop.
[02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:13.503]  In 1930, there was an oil boom from East Texas.
[02:16:14.123 --> 02:16:18.447]  And right now, going on in America, is the biggest renaissance in oil since 1930.
[02:16:18.567 --> 02:16:19.628]  It's the shale boom.
[02:16:20.408 --> 02:16:32.158]  And all this oil is producing huge new revenues for the Feds, and also enormous power for Obama, because right now, it's against the law to export oil.
[02:16:33.067 --> 02:16:38.693]  And so he has the ability to grant licenses that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations.
[02:16:39.333 --> 02:16:44.658]  And of course, he's going to use that power and all that leverage to propel himself into a third term.
[02:16:44.839 --> 02:16:52.006]  And yesterday, the Commerce Department announced that the United States is now the number one producer in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia.
[02:16:53.177 --> 02:16:58.321]  Yeah, most Americans don't realize what's happened over the last three or four years in the oil fields.
[02:16:59.241 --> 02:17:01.003]  There's been a huge renaissance in oil.
[02:17:01.243 --> 02:17:01.563]  I do!
[02:17:01.663 --> 02:17:03.444]  Everywhere I drive in Texas, they're drilling.
[02:17:03.845 --> 02:17:14.372]  Yeah, and listen, Alex, that's undeniably bullish for our economy, and it could absolutely sustain our currency for another five or ten years.
[02:17:14.652 --> 02:17:21.057]  This is going to really impact our trade deficits, and assuming that we begin to export this excess energy,
[02:17:21.758 --> 02:17:35.980]  It could really help the balance of trade for our country, but in the process, it's going to make an icon out of Obama, because he's going to take all this money like Chavez did, and he's going to buy more votes and more power with it, which is exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did, and it's exactly what FDR did.
[02:17:36.857 --> 02:17:48.902]  Well, that's what Lindsey Williams was saying, is that after they imploded the economy, they would bring in all this new oil, and that that would buoy things better than the rest of the world, but there'll still be an overall global depression.
[02:17:49.362 --> 02:17:54.344]  Or are you saying things will turn around, or you're saying they'll use this as the process of socialization?
[02:17:55.211 --> 02:18:01.393]  I'm saying that this is going to prevent an economic collapse for a certain amount of time.
[02:18:01.933 --> 02:18:10.455]  But instead of investing this money wisely to set our country back on a sound footing, they're going to use it to buy more power and more influence.
[02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:15.597]  And in the process, of course, they're going to squander this incredible natural resource that we have.
[02:18:16.417 --> 02:18:18.938]  And then that's going to put us even further in the hole.
[02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:22.859]  No matter how much resource you have, it doesn't matter.
[02:18:22.879 --> 02:18:28.881]  I mean, Venezuela is still a poor country, and they have more oil and gas resources than any other place in the world, right?
[02:18:29.301 --> 02:18:31.662]  So why can't they get their stuff together?
[02:18:32.082 --> 02:18:37.744]  And the answer is because, politically, they're using this resource for exactly all the wrong
[02:18:38.064 --> 02:18:38.564]  No, no, no.
[02:18:38.584 --> 02:18:40.324]  Ten years ago they had power on everywhere.
[02:18:40.364 --> 02:18:41.665]  Now the power's out half the time.
[02:18:42.085 --> 02:18:48.746]  Folks, you can see the full breakdown of this in an amazing video presentation at 3rdterm1.com.
[02:18:49.306 --> 02:18:50.426]  I hope everybody goes there.
[02:18:50.487 --> 02:18:53.587]  It's 3rdterm1.com.
[02:18:53.687 --> 02:18:54.687]  Just the number three.
[02:18:56.028 --> 02:18:59.008]  And 3rdterm1.com.
[02:18:59.028 --> 02:19:00.749]  We should link to this up at Infowars.com.
[02:19:00.789 --> 02:19:03.789]  You can also go to 3rdterm spelled out.
[02:19:03.809 --> 02:19:05.490]  It'll also work.
[02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:07.670]  3rdterm1.com will also work.
[02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:10.513]  Yeah, I just keep giving it out because I'm worried it's kind of a long URL.
[02:19:10.533 --> 02:19:13.936]  It's kind of a tricky URL, but just thirdterm1.com.
[02:19:14.116 --> 02:19:16.458]  Just go there and you'll see the whole presentation.
[02:19:18.661 --> 02:19:23.665]  But again, this will allow them to get more people on welfare, and then they will see Obama did it.
[02:19:24.226 --> 02:19:24.887]  It's so sick.
[02:19:26.118 --> 02:19:30.883]  Yeah, well, he's going to take credit for all this stuff, even though, of course, he's been against it the whole time.
[02:19:31.464 --> 02:19:34.707]  But it doesn't matter, because there's so much money to be made in this.
[02:19:34.847 --> 02:19:38.852]  I mean, Alex, you can't imagine how valuable this stuff is.
[02:19:38.872 --> 02:19:40.153]  Just think about this for one second.
[02:19:40.594 --> 02:19:44.458]  The price of WTI oil, that's the price of oil in the United States,
[02:19:44.958 --> 02:19:46.660]  And it gives you control to drive up or down the market.
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:47.081]  Wow!
[02:19:59.957 --> 02:20:00.277]  Stay there!
[02:20:00.418 --> 02:20:00.758]  Stay there!
[02:20:00.798 --> 02:20:01.159]  Stay there!
[02:20:01.219 --> 02:20:07.248]  Many conservatives believe the 2012 election was a disaster and hope 2016 will turn out much better.
[02:20:07.428 --> 02:20:15.079]  But even before he was re-elected, one of the country's most widely circulated newspapers discussed how our Commander-in-Chief could seek a third term.
[02:20:15.439 --> 02:20:20.282]  And one Maryland-based analyst says it's a lot more likely than most Americans think.
[02:20:20.542 --> 02:20:32.129]  In fact, he spent the past six months uncovering the details of a shocking event set to take place during Obama's second term, which could essentially enable Obama to extend his presidency for a third term.
[02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:36.052]  This would ultimately make him one of the most powerful presidents in U.S.
[02:20:36.092 --> 02:20:38.093]  history, a rival to FDR.
[02:20:38.334 --> 02:20:44.619]  This analyst believes it will change the course of our nation's future and profoundly affect the very well-being of you and your family.
[02:20:44.859 --> 02:20:49.262]  Get the facts for yourself, free of charge, at ThirdTermOne.com.
[02:20:49.602 --> 02:20:57.268]  Again, to learn exactly how Obama could end up being our next third-term president, go to www.thirdtermpresident1.com.
[02:20:57.288 --> 02:20:58.489]  That's ThirdTermOne.com.
[02:21:01.516 --> 02:21:05.238]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[02:21:05.498 --> 02:21:09.240]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:14.703]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.

[02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:29.432]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[02:21:30.353 --> 02:21:31.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.594 --> 02:21:35.997]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.177 --> 02:21:41.881]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.981 --> 02:21:45.383]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.623 --> 02:21:48.225]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.445 --> 02:21:53.248]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.388 --> 02:21:53.629]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.669 --> 02:21:55.050]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.213 --> 02:22:00.302]  Yeah.
[02:22:01.556 --> 02:22:06.938]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:22:07.538 --> 02:22:08.638]  That's closer than you think.
[02:22:09.379 --> 02:22:15.201]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[02:22:17.081 --> 02:22:23.484]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[02:22:24.284 --> 02:22:29.826]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:22:30.586 --> 02:22:31.586]  But here's some good news.
[02:22:31.966 --> 02:22:40.809]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:50.272]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:22:50.732 --> 02:22:54.773]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:56.434]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[02:23:01.598 --> 02:23:06.340]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:23:06.681 --> 02:23:08.522]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:23:08.822 --> 02:23:12.163]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:23:12.464 --> 02:23:16.746]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:23:16.946 --> 02:23:19.807]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:23:20.067 --> 02:23:24.390]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:30.673]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:23:31.013 --> 02:23:32.674]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:23:32.914 --> 02:23:40.898]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:23:41.198 --> 02:23:42.779]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:46.461]  So get one for you and one for a loved one.
[02:23:46.641 --> 02:23:49.402]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:23:49.622 --> 02:23:55.185]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[02:23:55.365 --> 02:23:56.686]  Faketv.com.
[02:23:56.946 --> 02:23:58.267]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:24:10.892 --> 02:24:13.554]  Was an inside job, just like it always is.
[02:24:15.475 --> 02:24:16.776]  Ornish Jansberry is our guest.
[02:24:16.796 --> 02:24:18.257]  We've got to get him on for a full hour soon.
[02:24:18.277 --> 02:24:19.377]  We've got Lou Rockwell coming up.
[02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.239]  More on Ron Paul's historical speech.
[02:24:21.639 --> 02:24:22.800]  We've got to get excited.
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.001]  We've got to take the states back.
[02:24:24.021 --> 02:24:27.403]  We've got to have the states get together and say, we're nullifying you.
[02:24:27.423 --> 02:24:28.764]  You want to call that secession, whatever.
[02:24:29.284 --> 02:24:30.185]  You seceded.
[02:24:30.585 --> 02:24:31.966]  You were taken over by the globalists.
[02:24:32.799 --> 02:24:34.782]  That's coffin nails to these people.
[02:24:34.802 --> 02:24:36.945]  We're going to draft Ron Paul to get that message out.
[02:24:37.105 --> 02:24:39.488]  Because he gave that message out in his speech and that's coming up.
[02:24:39.909 --> 02:24:41.751]  Porter, you're right, Putin...
[02:24:43.264 --> 02:24:47.166]  You've got folks in Argentina using oil to stay in power.
[02:24:48.106 --> 02:24:51.008]  You've got Venezuela with Chavez.
[02:24:51.628 --> 02:24:53.069]  And there is an oil boom.
[02:24:53.109 --> 02:24:56.270]  We're now numero uno, number one oil producer in the world.
[02:24:56.770 --> 02:25:01.012]  And it's something that cartels can control and that Obama can manipulate.
[02:25:01.512 --> 02:25:03.033]  Please continue on how that ties in.
[02:25:03.273 --> 02:25:04.734]  What will he do in that third term?
[02:25:04.974 --> 02:25:07.115]  I mean, we're talking about dictator Obama pretty much here.
[02:25:09.304 --> 02:25:14.546]  I think it's clear, if you look around the world, there's a link between oil and dictatorship.
[02:25:15.147 --> 02:25:19.368]  And the reason is, of course, is that oil delivers incredible amounts of wealth.
[02:25:19.888 --> 02:25:22.810]  And whoever controls that wealth has all the power.
[02:25:23.410 --> 02:25:29.612]  So, if you look at the Kirchners in Argentina, there was a husband and then there was a wife, and they've kept control of the government for a decade.
[02:25:30.133 --> 02:25:33.414]  Now, could Michelle Obama run in four years?
[02:25:34.275 --> 02:25:35.136]  I don't see why not.
[02:25:35.216 --> 02:25:37.579]  But I personally think it's going to be a stooge.
[02:25:37.639 --> 02:25:39.461]  It's going to be an Eric Holder type guy.
[02:25:40.182 --> 02:25:45.609]  That's assuming that he can't just flat out buy his way out of the 22nd Amendment, which I think he'll be able to.
[02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:48.853]  And let me give you some facts that you can focus on, okay?
[02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:50.415]  These are the things you should watch for.
[02:25:51.557 --> 02:25:53.319]  Right now, there are a dozen U.S.
[02:25:53.759 --> 02:25:55.060]  companies, 12 U.S.
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:26:02.427]  companies, that have filed for a license to export LNG, which is liquefied natural gas.
[02:26:02.788 --> 02:26:08.093]  And Alex, I know you're aware that there is a huge glut of natural gas in the United States.
[02:26:08.909 --> 02:26:14.833]  The prices of natural gas have fallen so low that the companies are flaring the stuff off rather than bothering to put it through the pipeline.
[02:26:14.853 --> 02:26:16.014]  They're just keeping it in the ground.
[02:26:16.034 --> 02:26:16.815]  They got it turned down.
[02:26:16.875 --> 02:26:17.996]  Boy, am I aware of that.
[02:26:18.016 --> 02:26:22.619]  Yeah, okay, so there's nothing wrong with us selling this stuff overseas because we're drowning in it, okay?
[02:26:23.399 --> 02:26:27.863]  But they can't, Obama has sat on these licenses for over a year.
[02:26:28.063 --> 02:26:30.785]  He will not give anyone a license to export the LNG.
[02:26:31.725 --> 02:26:31.985]  Why?
[02:26:32.426 --> 02:26:34.687]  Well, very simply, no one's paid him enough money yet.
[02:26:34.707 --> 02:26:36.688]  They all wanted to see whether he would win this election.
[02:26:37.068 --> 02:26:39.149]  Now that he's won the election, he's going to collect.
[02:26:39.729 --> 02:26:42.931]  Think about what happened when he gave up his Senate seat in Illinois.
[02:26:42.951 --> 02:26:44.912]  Remember the governor there, Blagojevich?
[02:26:44.972 --> 02:26:45.292]  Yes.
[02:26:45.832 --> 02:26:47.913]  Remember what he said over the FBI wiretap?
[02:26:47.953 --> 02:26:49.934]  He said, this thing is effing valuable.
[02:26:50.215 --> 02:26:51.775]  I'm going to get something for it, right?
[02:26:52.196 --> 02:26:52.456]  Yes.
[02:26:52.876 --> 02:26:58.399]  Well, believe me, these licenses are worth a lot more than a stupid Senate seat.
[02:26:59.239 --> 02:27:06.827]  These things are worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars because the price of natural gas in Japan is $16 at MCF.
[02:27:07.008 --> 02:27:10.571]  It's also a way to cut Russia off from Europe.
[02:27:10.872 --> 02:27:13.054]  Russia's playing blackmail with their natural gas.
[02:27:13.314 --> 02:27:16.418]  They're going to have those super tankers ship that stuff to Europe.
[02:27:17.811 --> 02:27:23.253]  This stuff, this energy we have, is the most valuable thing in the world's economy.
[02:27:23.593 --> 02:27:32.337]  It's valuable politically, it's valuable in terms of the macro-politics of the globe, and most importantly, it's powerful politically.
[02:27:32.397 --> 02:27:34.998]  It gives him enormous amounts of power in the country.
[02:27:35.478 --> 02:27:39.840]  So if he says, hey, I'll give you a license as long as you back my third term, what's he going to get?
[02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:44.511]  He's going to get the third term.
[02:27:44.731 --> 02:27:50.153]  So he's going to buy off the poor with welfare, and he's going to buy off the corporations with energy.
[02:27:53.054 --> 02:27:54.995]  Is there any way to stop this nightmare?
[02:27:55.015 --> 02:27:58.716]  Because, I mean, he says he's going to try to ban semi-auto guns.
[02:27:58.756 --> 02:28:04.779]  That will start a civil war, and then I guess all the corporations will line up behind him to just take over America as long as they can make some money.
[02:28:05.646 --> 02:28:13.012]  I don't think there's any way to stop this as long as you have the system in place we have, where so few people support so many others.
[02:28:13.532 --> 02:28:20.018]  I mean, look, 10% of the people in the United States are paying for 75% of Obama's largesse.
[02:28:20.538 --> 02:28:23.380]  Half the people in the country are dependent upon the federal government.
[02:28:24.301 --> 02:28:27.083]  You know, 50 million people are getting
[02:28:28.044 --> 02:28:29.366]  We're good to go.
[02:28:44.676 --> 02:28:44.996]  I know.
[02:28:45.456 --> 02:28:49.558]  Listen, Porter, I've got to have you back up soon for a full hour because you talk about the zombies.
[02:28:50.039 --> 02:28:52.940]  It is getting frightening when people, you told them about all the tyranny.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.181]  These yuppies and people giggle and laugh.
[02:28:55.441 --> 02:28:57.082]  They're so disconnected from reality.
[02:28:57.102 --> 02:28:58.442]  They've never had their butt kicked.
[02:28:58.683 --> 02:28:59.723]  They've never been in the military.
[02:28:59.743 --> 02:29:00.603]  They've never been mugged.
[02:29:00.803 --> 02:29:01.744]  They've never gone hungry.
[02:29:01.964 --> 02:29:03.305]  They've never worked a day in their life.
[02:29:03.365 --> 02:29:04.765]  And they think it's all funny.
[02:29:04.785 --> 02:29:07.947]  I have no idea what these idiots are going to think when it all collapses.
[02:29:09.284 --> 02:29:11.845]  Well, you know, they're not going to do very well.
[02:29:12.366 --> 02:29:13.346]  I can guarantee you that.
[02:29:13.386 --> 02:29:18.369]  And I've thought for a long time what would happen if the food stamps checks wouldn't clear.
[02:29:18.509 --> 02:29:21.791]  You know, if there was so much inflation that the food stamps wouldn't buy you food anymore.
[02:29:22.331 --> 02:29:24.653]  What would happen to an urban setting like Baltimore?
[02:29:24.673 --> 02:29:25.893]  Or what would happen in Houston?
[02:29:26.514 --> 02:29:33.898]  And I think those people who are ignoring these fiscal problems and who are ignoring what's happened to the morality of our country are going to be in for a rude awakening one day.
[02:29:34.278 --> 02:29:34.778]  Absolutely.
[02:29:34.818 --> 02:29:35.719]  The Ron Paul speech.
[02:29:36.039 --> 02:29:37.160]  Parts of it's coming up.
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:38.101]  It's just off the charts.
[02:29:38.121 --> 02:29:39.882]  We're going to be playing it all over the next week here.
[02:29:40.262 --> 02:29:41.843]  And it's posted at Infowars.com.
[02:29:42.504 --> 02:29:48.128]  Go to the website 3rdterm1.com to see the powerful video presentation.
[02:29:48.528 --> 02:29:49.609]  3rdterm1.com.
[02:29:50.409 --> 02:29:51.310]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.810 --> 02:29:53.611]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.332 --> 02:29:57.014]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.485 --> 02:30:07.729]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[02:30:08.109 --> 02:30:10.511]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[02:30:10.591 --> 02:30:10.891]  The U.S.
[02:30:10.971 --> 02:30:15.074]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[02:30:15.194 --> 02:30:17.776]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[02:30:18.156 --> 02:30:19.417]  They want that attack to come.
[02:30:19.637 --> 02:30:25.821]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[02:30:26.226 --> 02:30:28.689]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[02:30:28.889 --> 02:30:33.654]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:30:33.854 --> 02:30:41.302]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:30:41.602 --> 02:30:44.145]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:30:44.365 --> 02:30:47.008]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[02:31:03.952 --> 02:31:08.774]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:31:08.954 --> 02:31:16.137]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:31:16.277 --> 02:31:21.684]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:32:11.002 --> 02:32:14.625]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:32:55.478 --> 02:33:03.529]  There's always room in life for this.
[02:33:28.553 --> 02:33:34.995]  We're going to be playing excerpts throughout the nightly news tonight, tomorrow, the Sunday show.
[02:33:35.015 --> 02:33:45.959]  I want to play about a 3-4 minute clip before we get Lew Rockwell on to talk about the secession movement and the threats that are flying from the feds and their cohorts who want to have a military conflict with the American people.
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:52.502]  The socialists on their sites are, it's time to arrest him, it's time to go in with the militias, we'll take everything they've got and redistribute it.
[02:33:52.822 --> 02:33:56.806]  And these are all like these little spindly-necked wimps who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:33:57.166 --> 02:34:00.589]  You dirty little commies, go ahead and try to start a fight and see what happens to you.
[02:34:00.849 --> 02:34:08.616]  You make me want to throw up how you work for the foreign banks and, you know, for every three shillings the New World Order gets, you get one.
[02:34:08.636 --> 02:34:14.781]  I mean, it's disgusting how you've sold everything out and your socialism and your fake moral high ground and the rest of it.
[02:34:14.901 --> 02:34:17.003]  It's just unbelievable what parasites you are.
[02:34:18.084 --> 02:34:29.449]  But I want to play Ron Paul here in his summation from his speech because he talks about world government and how we're under world government now commanding our military.
[02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:32.210]  And then we'll go to Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com.
[02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:42.795]  Here is Ron Paul's conclusion to the 48, 49 minute powerhouse speech that's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:42.835 --> 02:34:43.175]  Here it is.
[02:34:44.901 --> 02:34:53.450]  In conclusion, what are the greatest dangers that the American people face today that impede the goal of a free society?
[02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.791]  There are five.
[02:34:55.552 --> 02:35:03.500]  The continuous attack on our civil liberties, which threaten the rule of law and our ability to resist the onrush of tyranny.
[02:35:04.258 --> 02:35:09.121]  Number two, violent anti-Americanism that has engulfed the world.
[02:35:09.682 --> 02:35:19.869]  Because the phenomenon of blowback is not understood or denied, our foreign policy is destined to keep us involved in many wars that we have no business being in.
[02:35:20.409 --> 02:35:25.033]  National bankruptcy and a greater threat to our national security will result.
[02:35:26.133 --> 02:35:26.714]  Number three,
[02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:39.092]  The ease in which we go to war, without a declaration by Congress, but accepting international authority from the UN or NATO, even for preemptive wars, otherwise known as aggression.
[02:35:40.113 --> 02:35:54.942]  A financial political crisis as a consequence of excessive debt, unfunded liabilities, spending, bailouts and gross discrepancy in wealth distribution, going from the middle class to the rich.
[02:35:56.730 --> 02:36:00.901]  The danger of central economic planning by the Federal Reserve must be understood.
[02:36:03.266 --> 02:36:06.027]  World government taking over local and U.S.
[02:36:06.047 --> 02:36:17.209]  sovereignty by getting involved in the issues of war, welfare, trade, banking, world currency, taxes, property, ownership and private ownership of guns must be addressed.
[02:36:17.829 --> 02:36:21.410]  Happily, there's an answer for these very dangerous trends.
[02:36:21.870 --> 02:36:27.231]  What a wonderful world it would be if everyone accepted the simple moral premise of rejecting all acts of aggression.
[02:36:27.751 --> 02:36:37.715]  The retort to such a suggestion is always, it's too simplistic, too idealistic, impractical, naive, utopian, dangerous, and unrealistic to strive for such an ideal.
[02:36:38.795 --> 02:36:49.419]  The answer to that is that for thousands of years the acceptance of government force to rule over the people at the sacrifice of liberty was considered moral and the only available option for achieving peace and prosperity.
[02:36:50.146 --> 02:36:52.228]  What could be more utopian than that myth?
[02:36:52.528 --> 02:37:05.961]  Considering the results, especially looking at the state-sponsored killing by nearly every government during the 20th century, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of people, it's time to reconsider this grant of authority to the state.
[02:37:06.781 --> 02:37:13.328]  No good has ever come from granting monopoly power to the state to use aggression... We are going to air all of this...
[02:37:15.046 --> 02:37:20.191]  On the Sunday radio show, over two hours, I'm going to be there playing five-minute clips, commenting.
[02:37:20.311 --> 02:37:25.836]  It is the greatest political speech that I've ever seen, because it's not political, it's about reality.
[02:37:26.397 --> 02:37:33.203]  Ron Paul is calling for a return of reality and sanity, and I've never been more proud to know Ron Paul.
[02:37:33.263 --> 02:37:39.830]  I've never been more proud to know he's right, and historically the collectivism, despite all its promises, is a nightmare.
[02:37:40.546 --> 02:37:47.389]  And how he indicted the megabanks taking us over, the world government, the preparations for mass arrest.
[02:37:47.869 --> 02:37:52.591]  He laid it out and said, folks, we have psychopathic authoritarians.
[02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:53.271]  These are quotes.
[02:37:54.111 --> 02:38:00.194]  I mean, this is a speech that I would like to write, because I've always wanted to do a whole film just breaking down the continuum of it.
[02:38:01.707 --> 02:38:02.447]  And he's done it.
[02:38:02.707 --> 02:38:11.291]  And I have announced, that's why today I had an epiphany last night, I knew the states' right movement was what the globalists were preparing for because they know it's the constitutional remedy.
[02:38:12.292 --> 02:38:20.996]  They're spinning secession like it's the Civil War and racist and saying there's going to be violence and that Obama needs to ride in like Lincoln and arrest people.
[02:38:21.196 --> 02:38:23.017]  This is petitions at the White House now.
[02:38:23.037 --> 02:38:25.598]  I mean, I've got them right here where they say, arrest us, all this.
[02:38:26.198 --> 02:38:27.819]  This isn't even what I'd call secession.
[02:38:27.919 --> 02:38:34.764]  It's the states saying the federal government sold out to foreign corporate interests, the globalists, world government, now commanding our military, NATO.
[02:38:35.905 --> 02:38:38.226]  They brag in the newspaper we've been conquered by foreign banks.
[02:38:38.666 --> 02:38:43.650]  We've got to have Ron Paul go out with that message, with Campaign for Liberty, that knows where all the patriots are at.
[02:38:45.174 --> 02:38:58.000]  I have competing ideas for a reissuance of the original Declaration of Independence with a battle plan to say you're a legitimate Federal Reserve, you've hijacked the country, you've now got governing power under the Dodd-Frank bill.
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:59.040]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:02.081]  And we repudiate this.
[02:39:02.401 --> 02:39:08.484]  And what it is, is it's a platform to challenge them and people see legitimacy in government.
[02:39:08.684 --> 02:39:10.105]  So through the states, even though
[02:39:11.385 --> 02:39:12.627]  They're more legitimate than the feds.
[02:39:12.647 --> 02:39:13.507]  They're still a problem.
[02:39:14.028 --> 02:39:16.890]  We can literally beat these people.
[02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:18.311]  It's the best platform.
[02:39:18.652 --> 02:39:26.679]  It needs to be led by Ron Paul, as I said in the first hour, Lou Rockwell, Eben Vieira, Bruce Fine, and other constitutional lawyers, and men of true integrity.
[02:39:27.299 --> 02:39:31.523]  Okay, and there's some women out there that have fought tyranny with integrity.
[02:39:31.963 --> 02:39:39.630]  I'm not even saying I'm in this rodeo, but I've rung the bell, and I know this is the battle plan, and this is the way to go.
[02:39:40.411 --> 02:39:42.433]  We have to offensively, because there's a hunger.
[02:39:42.493 --> 02:39:44.335]  Now it's 1.3 million signatures.
[02:39:44.475 --> 02:39:47.217]  All 50 states are about to qualify for a White House response.
[02:39:47.698 --> 02:39:52.602]  Sure, you don't go to the government, the feds, and say give up your power, but it's tacking
[02:39:52.602 --> 02:39:53.042]  We're good to go.
[02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:23.616]  I don't know what his take is going to be on this, but I think it'll be with me because it's constitutional, it's historical, it's a reissuance of the Declaration of Independence, it's a re-upload of that, but the Feds have been seized by globalists.
[02:40:23.716 --> 02:40:24.877]  It's totally special interest.
[02:40:25.218 --> 02:40:30.744]  As Ron Paul said, we have to start with states that have enough moral people and enough producers left.
[02:40:31.385 --> 02:40:35.531]  To stand up and say, I'm not a slave, it's the new civil rights movement, it's the real civil rights movement.
[02:40:36.051 --> 02:40:44.102]  We are going to have the state stand up with petitions at the legislature, legislatures voting, to say, full annulment, we do not recognize you anymore.
[02:40:44.343 --> 02:40:47.787]  We are America, we are the republic, so not even secession.
[02:40:48.428 --> 02:40:52.911]  It's pulling out of the occupied federal government to re-establish the republic.
[02:40:53.291 --> 02:40:58.715]  Now, again, we have to get our own petitions, not that they matter at the federal level, except in the image.
[02:40:59.215 --> 02:41:01.337]  The whole world's a stage, each of us players upon it.
[02:41:01.617 --> 02:41:04.479]  It's a real stage with life and death, but it's how you present it.
[02:41:04.959 --> 02:41:06.961]  And so we need Lou Rockwell to come up with ideas.
[02:41:07.041 --> 02:41:07.701]  Ron Paul.
[02:41:08.121 --> 02:41:13.045]  Ron Paul must put on the mantle, as constitutional lawyer Vieira said, who advises Paul.
[02:41:13.345 --> 02:41:14.686]  He totally agreed with my plan.
[02:41:14.907 --> 02:41:15.908]  We must launch it now.
[02:41:16.528 --> 02:41:17.609]  The flood has come.
[02:41:17.669 --> 02:41:20.012]  We must surf this thing or it's over.
[02:41:20.292 --> 02:41:21.453]  They're going to start a civil war.
[02:41:21.953 --> 02:41:23.115]  Okay, they're coming for you.
[02:41:23.355 --> 02:41:25.257]  The authoritarians know time's running out.
[02:41:25.297 --> 02:41:27.279]  Lou, I got you on and I'm ranting here.
[02:41:27.759 --> 02:41:31.403]  I'm so excited because a few times in my life things have crystallized.
[02:41:31.943 --> 02:41:33.464]  And I know when I'm right.
[02:41:33.864 --> 02:41:35.645]  I know when I've done the historical research.
[02:41:35.725 --> 02:41:37.365]  And I know when the zeitgeist is there.
[02:41:37.665 --> 02:41:42.047]  And I have never, this is ten times the electricity I've ever felt.
[02:41:42.367 --> 02:41:45.408]  Lew Rockwell, what do you say to what I've just laid out here?
[02:41:45.468 --> 02:41:47.689]  All I'm laying out is what our country was founded on.
[02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:49.430]  Can we rediscover the republic?
[02:41:49.690 --> 02:41:50.690]  Can it rise again?
[02:41:50.931 --> 02:41:56.713]  Will you help us get Ron Paul to lead this exploratory movement to really get aggressive?
[02:41:57.654 --> 02:42:05.922]  Well certainly Alex, Ron Paul is the leader as we saw in this fantastic Farewell to Congress speech, one of the great speeches of all of American history.
[02:42:07.203 --> 02:42:09.145]  He is the leader, he's going to continue to be the leader.
[02:42:09.205 --> 02:42:13.009]  I would say he's going to be a more effective leader now that he's out of electoral politics.
[02:42:13.029 --> 02:42:14.991]  He's got many wonderful things in
[02:42:20.523 --> 02:42:20.904]  I don't know.
[02:42:31.155 --> 02:42:31.395]  It's wrong.
[02:42:50.776 --> 02:42:52.717]  Everything should be handled at the level of the individual.
[02:42:53.117 --> 02:42:54.558]  Others at the level of the family.
[02:42:54.938 --> 02:42:56.839]  Others at the level of the local community.
[02:42:57.239 --> 02:43:03.262]  And you do not have the higher governments in society controlling the lower.
[02:43:03.622 --> 02:43:05.563]  You have it just the reverse.
[02:43:05.963 --> 02:43:12.906]  So this policy of decentralization, of secession, is absolutely a key principle of
[02:43:15.553 --> 02:43:21.740]  The worst thing that could happen to this country is we'd get a consolidated government, a centralized government.
[02:43:22.241 --> 02:43:25.705]  But it's one of the bad things about government, many bad things about government.
[02:43:25.985 --> 02:43:31.071]  One of the bad things about government is they all get together to increase centralization.
[02:43:32.522 --> 02:43:44.352]  Hans Hoppe has pointed out why this is in their interest, so that you have, whether it's what's happening in the EU, individual countries conglomerating together to make a unified state in Europe, or at least that's what they want.
[02:43:44.573 --> 02:43:56.103]  It's already happened in this country, we've had state and local authority, needless to say individual authority and other sorts of private authority, wiped out or crushed by the federal government as it's become more and more of a
[02:43:56.223 --> 02:43:56.383]  I don't
[02:44:12.483 --> 02:44:15.885]  person, political person, maybe in the history of the human race.
[02:44:16.225 --> 02:44:18.406]  I'm sure the pharaoh wanted to be head of the world too.
[02:44:18.766 --> 02:44:40.138]  So all these guys want this, but on the other side of power, glory for the state, conglomeration, centralization, stepping on other people, killing, mass killing, mass spying, all the wonderful things the government does to us and to people in other countries, there is the opposing moral force
[02:44:40.698 --> 02:44:41.379]  What do we call it?
[02:44:41.399 --> 02:44:41.919]  Secession?
[02:44:42.279 --> 02:44:43.400]  Decentralization?
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:49.564]  And I would argue, as Hans Hoppe and others have pointed out, this really should go down to the individual level.
[02:44:49.904 --> 02:44:51.846]  We should be able to secede as individuals.
[02:44:52.606 --> 02:44:55.068]  Alex, like you, I never signed the U.S.
[02:44:55.108 --> 02:44:55.788]  Constitution.
[02:44:56.609 --> 02:45:02.253]  This, of course, was a point that Alexander Spooner made in the middle of the 19th century.
[02:45:02.533 --> 02:45:03.754]  We didn't agree to this.
[02:45:04.154 --> 02:45:05.815]  This is something that's imposed on us.
[02:45:06.175 --> 02:45:07.056]  So the government imposed
[02:45:09.397 --> 02:45:09.657]  I don't
[02:45:30.384 --> 02:45:42.926]  I agree with you that the Declaration of Independence, which is a declaration of secession, is maybe something we can very much count on rhetorically and its principles.
[02:45:43.546 --> 02:45:57.909]  But, you know, we always have to remember, too, and Ron Paul has pointed this out just recently, America, if we think of the current American system, was founded by the secession of the 13 colonies, which were 13 little independent countries, and too bad
[02:46:01.732 --> 02:46:01.972]  I think?
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:27.420]  Yes.
[02:46:52.813 --> 02:46:53.513]  We're good to go.
[02:47:25.291 --> 02:47:29.476]  We don't want centralization, let alone of course we don't want world government or anything like it.
[02:47:33.587 --> 02:47:35.208]  Which is too big to be free.
[02:47:35.368 --> 02:47:40.612]  You can't have 330 million people under one gigantic government and think you're going to have freedom.
[02:47:40.872 --> 02:47:43.534]  You don't have freedom, you have tyranny, which of course is what we've got.
[02:47:43.955 --> 02:47:44.475]  Absolutely.
[02:47:44.575 --> 02:47:45.616]  Lew Rockwell's our guest.
[02:47:46.116 --> 02:47:55.603]  I'm sure you know, because we actually have an article on lewrockwell.com, Glenn Beck has told his listeners, and I don't want to get into a bashing thing with him, it may just be pure fear.
[02:47:55.643 --> 02:47:56.184]  I'd like to bash him.
[02:47:56.644 --> 02:47:59.628]  Well, I mean, my point is, he's saying, don't you dare sign that.
[02:47:59.908 --> 02:48:00.730]  You'll be a traitor.
[02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:02.292]  I have his quote in the video here.
[02:48:02.652 --> 02:48:13.827]  And then we get emails, I know you're getting them, and we've got an example right here, anti-secession threat, where it's like, I strongly suggest you do not sign this petition or align yourself with any group that would place your allegiance.
[02:48:14.808 --> 02:48:16.029]  Uh, to the country in question.
[02:48:16.209 --> 02:48:30.659]  How about our country got taken over by globalists who brag that they've conquered America on CNBC and the Associated Press banking cartels that literally take my money and give it to them while they debase the rest of the money and then they're saying it's racist.
[02:48:30.699 --> 02:48:32.340]  The new civil war is about to begin.
[02:48:32.621 --> 02:48:34.162]  Obama will be the new Lincoln.
[02:48:34.362 --> 02:48:35.783]  They've been getting ready for this forever.
[02:48:36.343 --> 02:48:37.904]  I mean, these people are truly sick.
[02:48:37.924 --> 02:48:48.193]  They have petitions signed to arrest us and to have federal militias come in and retake the states with volunteer Democrats who want to run around in little Soviet uniforms.
[02:48:48.433 --> 02:48:51.736]  They're dreaming of some Soviet... I mean, these people are sick!
[02:48:52.156 --> 02:48:55.299]  These people... Alex, I can remember when Glenn Beck said that Ron Paul supported
[02:48:55.299 --> 02:48:57.840]  Yeah, he called me a piece of garbage two days ago!
[02:49:17.346 --> 02:49:19.047]  And we're not allowed to get out from under them.
[02:49:19.487 --> 02:49:26.091]  And of course, this is, you know, the government in the American past has killed people for wanting to get out from under it.
[02:49:26.491 --> 02:49:31.474]  So we can't, you know, we always have to be aware that they are violence incorporated.
[02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:33.415]  On the other hand, we don't need violence.
[02:49:34.015 --> 02:49:38.798]  We have the ideas, the right ideas on our side, the ideas of freedom, the ideas of self-determination.
[02:49:39.198 --> 02:49:43.901]  Who is Barack Obama or Mitt Romney or Mitt Romney's assistant?
[02:49:48.848 --> 02:49:58.141]  Washington should be running them, should be supervising them as to how they raise their children, should be supervising their home, supervising their neighborhood, supervising their business.
[02:49:58.161 --> 02:50:00.644]  That's just pure tyranny.
[02:50:01.205 --> 02:50:03.769]  And again, we need a much smaller country.
[02:50:03.789 --> 02:50:04.770]  It would be a great thing to
[02:50:07.316 --> 02:50:10.297]  And it created competition between those and firewalls to tyranny.
[02:50:31.411 --> 02:50:33.471]  No, this is the way it's supposed to be.
[02:50:33.511 --> 02:50:38.152]  This was the way it was in the Middle Ages, when you just have tiny, tiny countries.
[02:50:38.192 --> 02:50:43.213]  So we've had this terrible tendency by politicians to try to conglomerate together.
[02:50:43.553 --> 02:50:47.914]  The better to rip us off, the better to rule us, the better to put their boot on our neck.
[02:50:48.634 --> 02:50:49.855]  That's what they live for, they love.
[02:50:49.895 --> 02:50:55.856]  And of course, the better to wage wars, the better to take all our money through taxation, the better to control every aspect of our lives.
[02:50:55.876 --> 02:50:56.916]  Lew Rockwell, stay there.
[02:50:56.936 --> 02:50:57.156]  Stay there.
[02:50:57.236 --> 02:51:00.077]  I want to talk about how we take the republic back.
[02:51:00.097 --> 02:51:00.957]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.903 --> 02:51:06.047]  What do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[02:51:06.467 --> 02:51:09.870]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from StockStorage.com.

[02:54:12.677 --> 02:54:18.522]  Again, we have a global corporate banking cartel that's gotten our government to sign on to all of its fraud.
[02:54:18.542 --> 02:54:27.830]  They've got a giant horde of people who don't even know how to tie their shoelaces, who are totally domesticated, calling for anybody who works his head in total class warfare.
[02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:29.171]  Envy.
[02:54:29.431 --> 02:54:32.974]  We've seen this happen hundreds of times the last thousand years or so.
[02:54:33.054 --> 02:54:34.375]  We are in deep trouble.
[02:54:34.415 --> 02:54:35.376]  This country has cancer.
[02:54:35.997 --> 02:54:38.599]  All I say is we can debate smaller units later.
[02:54:38.879 --> 02:54:41.241]  The states are what could deliver that under the Constitution.
[02:54:41.562 --> 02:54:46.806]  We got to kick the globalists out of Washington and then reconstitute the Republic if that's what the states chose.
[02:54:47.287 --> 02:54:51.411]  All I know is I want the foreign occupying force out and lube
[02:54:52.111 --> 02:54:54.354]  I don't want to just move around and try to get people elected to Congress.
[02:54:54.654 --> 02:54:57.538]  I think it's now time to go to the states and say, hey, you want to secede?
[02:54:57.779 --> 02:55:02.324]  Or you want to develop a plan to have a new Declaration of Independence to kick the globalists out?
[02:55:02.364 --> 02:55:06.550]  Because the globalists, I know you've seen this in the news, they're bragging they've conquered our country.
[02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:08.412]  And I think that's pretty important.
[02:55:09.286 --> 02:55:16.609]  That all these big mega banks and, you know, CNBC and the Associated Press tell us we're now run by foreign banks, but that's a good thing.
[02:55:16.629 --> 02:55:17.209]  They know best.
[02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:22.872]  Yes, global government's here, but the ADL says you're a terrorist if you say there's a world government.
[02:55:23.332 --> 02:55:26.233]  You know, it's time to just go all the way here.
[02:55:26.273 --> 02:55:27.134]  What's your take on that?
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.363]  Well, I think our ideas are winning.
[02:55:31.403 --> 02:55:33.625]  This is what bothers the opposition.
[02:55:34.826 --> 02:55:46.236]  And I think it's wonderful that if a state wants to, for example, seek to use gold and silver as money internally, or all those other kinds of things, get rid of federal regulations, nullify federal regulations,
[02:55:47.176 --> 02:55:54.161]  I remember the great moment when South Carolina, to oppose the rotten tariffs of Andrew Jackson.
[02:55:54.181 --> 02:55:57.483]  They said nothing to do with slavery, by the way, despite the propaganda.
[02:55:57.963 --> 02:56:03.867]  They said, if you try to raise taxes to the extent you're going to destroy us, if you try to do that, we're
[02:56:11.058 --> 02:56:13.860]  That was the first great nullification.
[02:56:14.401 --> 02:56:17.163]  And as Jefferson, Tom Woods has a great book on nullification.
[02:56:17.683 --> 02:56:21.026]  If you're interested in this topic, everybody, take a look at Tom's book.
[02:56:21.226 --> 02:56:23.487]  And the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:56:23.908 --> 02:56:25.449]  We are being destroyed.
[02:56:25.489 --> 02:56:29.832]  We are being physically attacked financially by these people.
[02:56:29.852 --> 02:56:30.573]  Here's what I'm saying.
[02:56:31.113 --> 02:56:32.294]  I know the energy's there.
[02:56:32.635 --> 02:56:55.237]  If Ron Paul steps up and says he's going to lead a movement, I know they're going for internet freedom because they put out a questionnaire to the Campaign for Liberty people, I looked at it and I said internet was important, so he's going with what his constituents of Liberty have pushed for, but I think it's important to codify and go, look, this nullification's going to happen, Campaign for Liberty's got to get out front, Lou Rockwell's got to get out front, you've been out front, but say, hey,
[02:56:55.757 --> 02:56:58.919]  You know, this isn't what you say a secession is.
[02:56:58.999 --> 02:57:04.442]  This is reconstituting the Republic, kicking the globalists out, kicking the Federal Reserve out.
[02:57:04.603 --> 02:57:06.184]  I think we can rout these people.
[02:57:06.504 --> 02:57:11.527]  I'm telling you, there's a real revolutionary fervor there, Lou, and I think it's time to launch.
[02:57:12.167 --> 02:57:15.009]  Well, Alex, we've got the truth on our side, and the truth is that we all
[02:57:15.029 --> 02:57:15.249]  All right.
[02:57:30.266 --> 02:57:32.326]  Sure, what I'm saying is let's escalate it.
[02:57:59.332 --> 02:57:59.792]  Good, good.
[02:57:59.832 --> 02:58:01.914]  He already is leading it, but he's going to continue to lead it.
[02:58:02.695 --> 02:58:11.641]  Well, I know you talked to him quite often and got him on the show last week, and I'm glad that he's also taken over Campaign for Liberty and is reaffirming everything in there.
[02:58:14.123 --> 02:58:15.784]  Can you do five more minutes with us in overdrive?
[02:58:16.084 --> 02:58:16.284]  Sure.
[02:58:16.304 --> 02:58:18.346]  Okay, because I want to just have you make some final points.
[02:58:18.386 --> 02:58:19.306]  I know I'm running over you.
[02:58:19.607 --> 02:58:20.868]  It's just we need to do this now.
[02:58:21.068 --> 02:58:23.910]  All I'm saying is the nullification movements out there, the
[02:58:26.010 --> 02:58:26.750]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:26.770 --> 02:58:27.311]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.987 --> 02:58:53.768]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.048 --> 02:58:55.728]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[02:58:56.028 --> 02:58:59.349]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[02:58:59.650 --> 02:59:01.730]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:59:01.850 --> 02:59:05.291]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:59:05.491 --> 02:59:11.313]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:59:11.573 --> 02:59:14.934]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:15.274 --> 02:59:19.897]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:59:20.017 --> 02:59:25.741]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:26.001 --> 02:59:27.062]  And here's the best news.
[02:59:27.282 --> 02:59:30.224]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[02:59:30.444 --> 02:59:34.247]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[02:59:34.367 --> 02:59:38.230]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators, and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so,

[02:59:48.500 --> 02:59:50.402]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[02:59:51.924 --> 02:59:53.085]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.445 --> 02:59:54.787]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.507 --> 02:59:58.711]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:12.796 --> 03:00:16.759]  Ladies and gentlemen, final segment with Lou Rockwell on the nightly news tonight.
[03:00:16.799 --> 03:00:25.747]  Myself and Sha'Carri Jackson are going to be playing excerpts of the speech, analyzing it, and I'm here, you know, getting the real patriots on.
[03:00:25.767 --> 03:00:36.816]  Edwin Vieira, Lou Rockwell, Bruce Fine, we're going to get him on, the leader and the founder, another constitutional lawyer, and Ron Paul, former staffer, we're going to get
[03:00:38.237 --> 03:00:43.963]  We're going to get all the founder Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers on.
[03:00:44.324 --> 03:00:48.448]  And I'm just saying, look, let's not just talk about move for nullification of states' rights.
[03:00:48.809 --> 03:00:49.369]  Let's do it.
[03:00:49.730 --> 03:00:58.259]  If Ron Paul stands up and says, OK, the states have a right to tell the federal government they've become a foreign enemy.
[03:00:58.519 --> 03:00:59.300]  I mean, just bring it up.
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:00.041]  It's what it is.
[03:01:00.141 --> 03:01:01.022]  Call it like it is.
[03:01:01.503 --> 03:01:02.624]  He said it in his speech.
[03:01:02.664 --> 03:01:04.186]  We're being taken over by global government.
[03:01:05.027 --> 03:01:07.169]  And this isn't even secession.
[03:01:07.209 --> 03:01:08.851]  This is reconstituting the republic.
[03:01:09.232 --> 03:01:11.995]  No one's going to be able to argue with that or call it racist or all their garbage.
[03:01:12.275 --> 03:01:14.237]  And just move forward and do it.
[03:01:14.798 --> 03:01:15.558]  Just do it!
[03:01:16.259 --> 03:01:17.980]  And it's time to get on the offense.
[03:01:18.180 --> 03:01:18.600]  I'm ready.
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:20.181]  Lou Rockwell, we've got four minutes left.
[03:01:20.521 --> 03:01:21.402]  You've got the floor.
[03:01:22.302 --> 03:01:23.923]  Again, I'm just putting out the ideas there.
[03:01:23.943 --> 03:01:24.743]  I know they're already there.
[03:01:25.043 --> 03:01:26.444]  But do you agree, accelerate it?
[03:01:26.524 --> 03:01:31.087]  And can you get in there as one of the main leaders of this and work with Ron Paul?
[03:01:31.107 --> 03:01:33.068]  Because I'm telling you, the zeitgeist is now.
[03:01:33.328 --> 03:01:35.189]  We've got to strike while the iron's hot.
[03:01:36.232 --> 03:01:38.133]  Alex, this is the attitude we all have to have.
[03:01:38.213 --> 03:01:39.654]  First of all, this is how we start.
[03:01:39.995 --> 03:01:45.238]  We're walking on the street and some guy comes up and shoves a gun in your rib and says, give me your wallet.
[03:01:45.699 --> 03:01:48.220]  Maybe you're going to give him your wallet, but you're not going to give him your consent.
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:49.521]  You're going to realize you were robbed.
[03:01:50.002 --> 03:01:51.002]  That's the government.
[03:01:51.483 --> 03:01:56.766]  So you don't say, oh, thank you sir for protecting the public good and the common defense and everything by taking my money.
[03:01:57.487 --> 03:01:59.849]  Too many Americans have that attitude towards the government.
[03:02:00.249 --> 03:02:01.830]  The government is our enemy.
[03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:03.011]  It's a parasite.
[03:02:11.212 --> 03:02:12.052]  Ever to exist.
[03:02:12.573 --> 03:02:21.217]  So first of all we have to have, you know, the attitude that God created us free and the government is in effect serving Satan by taking away our freedom.
[03:02:21.337 --> 03:02:21.577]  Yes.
[03:02:21.637 --> 03:02:24.978]  So we have, you know, that's the nature of the struggle.
[03:02:25.478 --> 03:02:37.844]  Again, you have to know something about economics, you have to know something about American history, you have to know something about political philosophy and libertarianism and so forth to arm yourself intellectually, help arm other people intellectually.
[03:02:38.164 --> 03:02:39.845]  This has to be an intellectual fight
[03:02:42.329 --> 03:02:44.070]  They've got the tanks, they've got the atomic bombs.
[03:02:45.150 --> 03:02:46.391]  We can't fight them that way.
[03:02:47.131 --> 03:02:49.552]  And they used our energy and our smarts!
[03:02:49.713 --> 03:02:51.673]  They used our energy and our smarts to build it!
[03:02:52.574 --> 03:02:53.454]  Well, yeah, that's right.
[03:02:53.494 --> 03:02:54.955]  But we are the majority.
[03:02:55.595 --> 03:02:59.277]  The people who are the ripped off are far more of us than the rippers off.
[03:02:59.717 --> 03:03:01.998]  So we can fight them.
[03:03:02.339 --> 03:03:04.239]  First, refuse to give them a consent.
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:05.540]  Educate yourself.
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:06.801]  Talk to your neighbors.
[03:03:07.221 --> 03:03:11.783]  Stir up trouble in an intellectual sense by telling people
[03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:16.111]  We're good
[03:03:39.309 --> 03:03:39.709]  I think?
[03:03:59.042 --> 03:03:59.462]  I don't think so.
[03:04:28.371 --> 03:04:29.091]  Absolutely, in closing.
[03:04:29.131 --> 03:04:30.252]  LewRockwell.com, we salute you Lew.
[03:04:30.312 --> 03:04:30.732]  God bless you.
[03:04:58.663 --> 03:04:59.144]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:01.366 --> 03:05:08.293]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[03:05:08.513 --> 03:05:13.238]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow are
