[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.913]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:14.669]  As Agenda 21, the United Nations' plan to take control of the world from the local level up, grows across America under the guise of the Green Movement, our national sovereignty, our personal freedom, and our very way of life is under attack.
[00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:17.634]  What is Agenda 21 for new listeners?
[00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:18.434]  Why is it important?
[00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:20.455]  And what are the new big developments?
[00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.857]  I mean, is it safe to say the battle is joined right now, Rosa?
[00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:31.940]  For people who don't know what Agenda 21 is, it's basically, it's not what is Agenda 21, it's almost what isn't.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.961]  It is the blueprint.
[00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:41.364]  It is the action plan to inventory and control all land, all water,
[00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:54.101]  All plants, all minerals, all construction, all animals, all means of production, all energy, all information, and all human beings in the world.
[00:00:54.721 --> 00:01:00.963]  It is a completely comprehensive plan, it's global, and it's implemented locally.
[00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:14.814]  Agenda 21 highlights include the destruction of the family unit in the name of sustainable development, with people being forced to live in tight, compact cities in high-rise stack-em-and-pack-em apartments no bigger than this 16 by 16 foot space.
[00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:19.638]  I decided to ask people what they thought about the UN's plan to get people on the grid.
[00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.062]  So, would you live in a house no bigger than the size of this square?
[00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:33.364]  It feels like a jail cell, no way.
[00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:35.125]  I mean, it's impossible.
[00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:38.528]  Well, you know, it depends on what my options would be.
[00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:45.012]  If this was the only option, I'm sure it would be living under a bridge.
[00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:47.254]  You need one of these twice this size.
[00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.855]  This would be your entire house?
[00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:50.836]  Yeah, three times as big, really.
[00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:56.641]  Yeah, I've lived in one about this size, and it was like being an animal in a box or something.
[00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:58.582]  Would you do it for the good of the earth?
[00:01:59.423 --> 00:01:59.663]  Maybe.
[00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:00.838]  Yes.
[00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:01.299]  Yes.
[00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.779]  Yes.
[00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:05.101]  Yes, I would.
[00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:05.902]  You would?
[00:02:05.982 --> 00:02:06.202]  Yeah.
[00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:07.743]  Have you ever heard of Agenda 21?
[00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:07.964]  I haven't.
[00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:08.024]  No.
[00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:08.184]  No.

[00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:21.434]  No
[00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:24.248]  I think that's terrible.
[00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:33.152]  Sounds kind of like Chinese foreign policy or interior policy regarding their house and how they're controlling all aspects of your life.
[00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:35.112]  I don't think it sounds fair.
[00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:36.753]  Oh wow.
[00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:48.217]  This map, entitled Simulated Reserve and Corridor System to Protect Biodiversity, illustrates how the UN's Agenda 21 plan would work in the United States.
[00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.266]  Under this takeover, all personal property rights would cease to exist.
[00:02:54.187 --> 00:03:00.111]  The red zones, which make up the map's majority, will be mandated for little to no human use.
[00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:04.756]  The yellow zones are buffer zones for highly regulated use.
[00:03:05.836 --> 00:03:09.937]  Only in the scant green areas is any normal human use allowed.
[00:03:10.817 --> 00:03:26.819]  The tiny black dots are the dense megacities, where transportation will be tightly controlled, freedom will be restricted, and people will be packed in like sardines, living in tiny 275 square foot units amounting to little more than jail cells.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.600]  All in the name of saving the Earth.
[00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:36.175]  Let's move right along now to Agenda 21 micro apartment scheme being beta tested in New York City.
[00:03:36.595 --> 00:03:45.140]  Now they passed a law last year, 2011 in Germany, saying that all new homes by 2020 could not be single-parent.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.561]  You've got to live in these big dormitories.
[00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:58.328]  And now Bloomberg, who wants to control what you eat and what you do and ban your guns, says these studios and one-bedroom apartments, they're like closets, will be no bigger than 275 to 300 square feet.
[00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:00.830]  That's called a tiny supermax cell.
[00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.773]  These tiny living spaces are smaller than currently allowed by building regulations.
[00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:08.114]  And they say this is good for the earth.
[00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.196]  See, they can raise more taxes.
[00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:15.259]  They'll charge you more for a 200 square foot cell than for a 1,000 foot.
[00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:17.604]  This is how this works.
[00:04:18.627 --> 00:04:19.750]  More for less.
[00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:24.003]  The Eugenics Agenda 21 Post-Industrial Slave Model.
[00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.034]  They're actually already beta testing these micro apartments in New York City and San Francisco.
[00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:29.635]  Have you heard of that?
[00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:30.275]  I haven't.
[00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.056]  I'm afraid not.
[00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:35.980]  I think we need to support abandoning this idea.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.485]  Well, it's not going to happen if they're dealing with humans, because no one's going to bow down and say, yes, we are living in this.
[00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:45.547]  Not everybody's going to do it.
[00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.151]  As Agenda 21 creeps across the country, more and more people will be forced to face it.
[00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:58.035]  While sustainable development may sound like a beneficial idea, is giving up all of our liberty in the name of the greater good really such a good idea?
[00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.477]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
