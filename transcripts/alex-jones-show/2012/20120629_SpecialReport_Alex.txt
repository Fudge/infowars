[00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.011]  Hi and welcome.
[00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.472]  I'm Christy Hightower from Planet InfoWars.
[00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:21.574]  I'm here with Alex Jones to answer your questions from the Ask Alex group on Planet InfoWars.
[00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:23.634]  So let's get started, Alex.
[00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:25.455]  The first question is, hi Alex.
[00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:31.437]  I have just listened to your interview with David Rothschild, which apparently was a long time ago.
[00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:39.500]  But it was an excellent interview and it makes me think, are you going to grill any other elites like Rockefeller or Romney or Al Gore?
[00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:41.726]  Any plans for that?
[00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:43.712]  That is a fantastic question.
[00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:48.024]  We were able to get the heir of the Rothschild fortune.
[00:00:49.269 --> 00:01:02.579]  One of the top heirs, David de Rothschild, on because he had a book coming out that showed polar bears that couldn't swim dying and, you know, give Al Gore all your money, give the Rothschild carbon exchange that they own money, that's who runs it.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.783]  Like Australians, it's the only country to fully implement it, pay money to them to even live.
[00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:10.786]  Rothschilds, you know, we pay you money.
[00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.588]  How can we pay the banks money now through health care?
[00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:15.529]  It's a tax directly to them.
[00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.692]  I mean, just incredible, 35 million Americans being forced on.
[00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.595]  And people ask, how did you get Rothschild?
[00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:28.560]  Well, I'm telling all the radio producers out there, people who, well, I mean, radio producers, no, but people who don't understand the Internet.
[00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.723]  Some said, you must be working with him, you got him on.
[00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:38.789]  No, he was doing a book tour, and that's how you can get famous people on, is when they've got a book out.
[00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:42.605]  You can call their publicist or send it, and they just put you in the queue.
[00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.368]  So it was supposed to be a 10-minute interview.
[00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:51.194]  But once I baited him and said, oh, you're going to hang up, oh, you're scared, he stayed like 35, 40 minutes.
[00:01:51.874 --> 00:02:02.325]  And he said insane things like, oh my gosh, you know, the reason that the ice caps of Mars are melting is because it's closer to the sun than Earth.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.042]  Because I said, hey, we pay Al Gore carbon taxes, will he stop the ice caps of Mars from melting?
[00:02:11.683 --> 00:02:12.963]  And he said, no, that's preposterous.
[00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:14.003]  It's closer to the sun.
[00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:16.484]  That's why its ice caps are melting.
[00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:20.125]  And of course, everybody knows it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
[00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:21.126]  Exactly.
[00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:25.347]  Not, not, not Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth.
[00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:25.587]  Right.
[00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:35.075]  Uh, so it just shows the incredible hubris of these people, and here we are five years after I interviewed him, and of course that's famously also a clip of that semi-film Endgame.
[00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:37.176]  It's been totally exposed and blown away.
[00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.618]  By the way, this is totally unscripted.
[00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.941]  Usually she comes in and I kind of have ten seconds to look at the list.
[00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:47.145]  I didn't even look at it, didn't even know about that first question, so I can't wait to hear what the next one is.
[00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:48.586]  Whacking them out here.
[00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:49.627]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.849]  These are almost good brainstorming sessions.
[00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.335]  Uh, that is a major thing I want all the producers to go after.
[00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:02.781]  And that's why when we hire all these new reporters, and the great work you're doing, is you guys can just go after whoever you want.
[00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.466]  And we're gonna, you've seen them setting up all these mini studios with lights and cameras and Skype.
[00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.510]  You're gonna be able to just get somebody on, interview them.
[00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.971]  Awesome.
[00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.072]  And people are going to get bonuses.
[00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.794]  We're free market when they get big people on.
[00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:19.777]  So you're welcome to, we're going to set up subsidiary names.
[00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:26.562]  We're not lying, but it's a subsidiary of InfoWars that isn't as known so that you can call the publicists up.
[00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:28.104]  The problem is we're now known.
[00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.045]  So if they're not a fan, they're not coming on.
[00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.948]  It's like today, Chris thought to call William Shatner and everyone tried to get him on.
[00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:36.610]  He calls, gets his, you know,
[00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.890]  I don't
[00:03:53.257 --> 00:04:00.063]  You know, the famous journalist Pulitzer Prize winner, Chris Hedges, who is shooing over NDAA and actually got partially overturned.
[00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:03.387]  We called him, turned out he knew who we were, liked the work we're doing.
[00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:05.609]  He's like a liberal, but he's a real liberal.
[00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.870]  You know, he's against tyranny.
[00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.634]  Not, oh, well, I like Obama's tyranny because I'm a Democrat.
[00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:12.035]  Right.
[00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:14.297]  But I don't like Bush's tyranny because he's a Republican.
[00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:20.003]  So for our producers, because all we've got right now is Chris, who's great, but he's overworked.
[00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:25.149]  He's even running the board some, dealing with my media things, and he's doing a great job on the radio.
[00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:31.957]  We've got John Bowne getting into producing, you can start getting into producing, and basically whoever wants to can.
[00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:35.741]  And it isn't just going to be Alex Jones who interviews the cool person.
[00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.163]  It can be Christy.
[00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:38.445]  Awesome.
[00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:39.767]  It can be Aaron Dykes.
[00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:41.971]  I mean, that's what InfoWars is about.
[00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:47.841]  It's not just empowering our reporters and people, but you by our example and others examples leading.
[00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.864]  Look at Luke Radowski for my example.
[00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:53.255]  Speaking of confronting people, that was the last part of the questions.
[00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:54.696]  They had a whole brainstorm when you asked that.
[00:04:54.896 --> 00:05:02.501]  That's why it's so good for me to get, that's why I love getting questions originally when I've never seen them, because then it's that original, excited, neuron-firing thought.
[00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:08.985]  I've noticed when I've seen a story two or three times before I get on air, by the time I get on air, it's old and I don't want to read it.
[00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:09.545]  Right.
[00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.527]  It's a very strange phenomenon, so that's what I love this.
[00:05:13.107 --> 00:05:19.711]  I'm thinking about having them come in every day, like Chris or somebody else, and sit there while I'm on the radio and say, alright, here's the questions from Twitter.
[00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:20.751]  That'd be awesome.
[00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.472]  Or, here's the question from PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:05:23.672 --> 00:05:24.392]  Yeah.
[00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.713]  And so that it makes me get out of my pattern of just ranting, mad at news.
[00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:31.473]  I mean, I read almost all these articles the day before I even got here.
[00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.753]  Then I IM'd the guys that printed them off.
[00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.994]  I got here and never even opened most of these files.
[00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:44.115]  Economy, world news, stuff I was all angry about and ready to talk about with understanding of, and I got here and never covered it.
[00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:47.896]  So I've got to figure out some way where maybe I should start doing my radio show at 9 a.m.
[00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:50.096]  Just keep going.
[00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:52.137]  Instead of getting up at 6 a.m.
[00:05:52.157 --> 00:05:59.719]  and reading it all and then getting mad and coming up here, I can get here and actually maybe have a show where it's up on a big screen and I'm just analyzing it fresh right there.
[00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:00.219]  There you go.
[00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.740]  I'm having an epiphany here right now.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.980]  Yeah.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.960]  What was the other point?
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.640]  One-on-one.
[00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:06.681]  All of you can get out with a camera and confront globalists.
[00:06:06.781 --> 00:06:07.882]  We live in Austin, Texas.
[00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.084]  Globalist bigwigs, but also good people.
[00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.687]  A lot of famous people, interesting people come through Austin.
[00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:21.435]  We've just got to check the newspapers about when they're at book people, when they're at Barnes & Nobles, when they're at even at a, you know, theater or something because we can get in because we're press.
[00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.337]  We should be sending our reporters out to that.
[00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:29.904]  Austin is now a world-class city, but it's nothing like DC, LA, New York, Chicago, where
[00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:39.997]  Activists that are there, and we probably want to get some reporters and all those, I mean we already have them, but reporters that actually work for us can go out and do that as well and really just give us unlimited coverage.
[00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:42.220]  So big things are coming to the InfoWar.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.682]  You've only got about 20 questions.
[00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:44.463]  That's one of them.
[00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:46.185]  Let's go to the next one right now.
[00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.286]  We're moving right along.
[00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:54.011]  Alex, have you ever looked into the KGB files that were released in regards to the infiltration of the Vatican?
[00:06:54.131 --> 00:07:03.758]  It seems funny that the three of the last of the four popes have had to ride behind bulletproof glass, and yet the present pope does not.
[00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.439]  Any ideas?
[00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:08.838]  Yes, I actually did.
[00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:10.979]  I even read a book on that years ago.
[00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.059]  I even had a guest on.
[00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:12.919]  I did look into it.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.561]  Regardless of whether the Vatican was good or bad in the past, it is infiltrated with all sorts of globalists.
[00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:25.482]  And you can really see the power of what was the Vatican being deconstructed right now.
[00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:29.183]  And you can see the globalist media demonizing and attacking it.
[00:07:29.223 --> 00:07:29.983]  I'm not Catholic.
[00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:34.324]  I come from a famous family of Protestants back on both sides of the Mayflower.
[00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:41.028]  But regardless of that, so I'm not defending Catholicism or whatever, but I'm not bashing Catholics.
[00:07:41.048 --> 00:07:43.849]  I know a lot of Catholics that are good people that really stand up against tyranny.
[00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:52.752]  If you look at the media and how they operate, there's no doubt, worldwide, there is an attempt to bring down Catholicism.
[00:07:53.092 --> 00:08:00.434]  Because it's got all these religious systems and Christian systems, but others have to be brought down for this, the state is God model.
[00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.753]  And the new sacrament isn't, you know, go to the church and take communion.
[00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:08.215]  It's have the TSA abuse you.
[00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:09.837]  Stick their hands down your pants.
[00:08:09.977 --> 00:08:14.160]  And instead of offering your children to Moloch, you offer them to the TSA pervert.
[00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.502]  You offer your grandmother up to them.
[00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:18.624]  And so that's the new God.
[00:08:18.844 --> 00:08:25.930]  With the drones and the big government buildings and, you know, all the announcements and government-run health care, it's all about the state is God.
[00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.173]  And that means the special corporate interest, the bankers,
[00:08:30.247 --> 00:08:33.269]  Would have captured our country through fraud and bragged that they've done it.
[00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:35.190]  Like on that CNBC clip, did you see that?
[00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:35.411]  Yeah.
[00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:38.353]  Where they said, you know, the bankers now rule you, world government's good.
[00:08:38.613 --> 00:08:39.954]  But I thought that didn't exist.
[00:08:40.714 --> 00:08:46.619]  But then you also have the Vatican involved in 57 setting up the original Euro, the Treaty of Rome.
[00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:51.002]  So, it's, it's, all of these powerful institutions behave the same.
[00:08:51.402 --> 00:08:58.247]  It's just that they're sometimes at odds with each other, but they're not at odds with each other when it comes to feeding off the public.
[00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:02.797]  Yeah, they give us issues to just keep us busy, I feel like.
[00:09:03.037 --> 00:09:08.121]  I think in the final equation, all big institutions become corrupted, and most historians will tell you that.
[00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:15.587]  It's individual mavericks that are... I had Serpico on the radio today, you know, famous cop, exposed drug dealing, and they shot him in the face and all the rest of it.
[00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:17.348]  And it turns out he's a listener of the show.
[00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:20.471]  We called him up a year ago, he goes, oh, I listen to the show sometimes, yeah, I want to come on.
[00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:21.472]  Came on again.
[00:09:21.492 --> 00:09:25.195]  You know, and he's like, I visit InfoWars every day, I love your site.
[00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:27.216]  But he made a point about how
[00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:37.016]  He's run into police all over the country, police chiefs, but also in Europe who have routed out corruption and it was because they were in college and read his book about what happened.
[00:09:37.717 --> 00:09:44.843]  Or saw the Al Pacino movie and realized it's not about shaking people down and making money off drug dealers who live in a bigger house.
[00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:46.044]  It's about really helping people.
[00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:47.085]  Right.
[00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:49.908]  And so he was saying today, be an example.
[00:09:49.988 --> 00:09:51.049]  Inspire people.
[00:09:51.609 --> 00:10:03.580]  And so whether you're in the Catholic Church or whether you're in the Baptist Church or whether you're in the military or whether you're in corporate America, whether you're a bureaucrat or a schoolteacher, don't make excuses about the corrupt system you're in or who's up on top of it.
[00:10:04.744 --> 00:10:07.406]  What you do that's right changes that.
[00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:10.849]  I mean, it's a real battle between good and evil, and it's what we all do individually.
[00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.192]  So when we say, oh, it's corrupt, I'm gonna leave it alone, you're giving power to the evil.
[00:10:15.933 --> 00:10:20.036]  Yeah, a lot of people have been asking, there's a general question actually, like, what do we do?
[00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:23.759]  And the gray response that you seem to have is the little things.
[00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:29.503]  It's the little things like making copies of your DVDs, sending out flyers, just talking to people.
[00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:31.424]  Well, take PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:39.284]  It's success, and now we've gone through beta, and it had a few glitches like we knew, but now the guys have really got it working great.
[00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:40.705]  Incredible job.
[00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:49.070]  And so it's there for you, and people are meeting, they're dating, they're camping, they're shooting, they're getting together as activists, they're starting their own journalist groups.
[00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.011]  I get calls on the radio all the time.
[00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:54.433]  We should start a segment once a week on the radio about Planet InfoWorks.
[00:10:54.473 --> 00:10:55.073]  That'd be awesome.
[00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:56.454]  It's all part of this brainstorming.
[00:10:56.594 --> 00:10:56.774]  Yeah.
[00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:59.275]  And so just remind me to do that, please.
[00:11:01.463 --> 00:11:03.544]  Nudge me into doing it, because there's so much going on.
[00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:04.384]  You know how it is.
[00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:05.185]  We'll formulate it and come to you.
[00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:06.345]  I mean, you see what's going on around here.
[00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.145]  We're not sitting around.
[00:11:07.165 --> 00:11:07.746]  No, absolutely not.
[00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:09.166]  Because we know the time is short.
[00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:10.587]  The enemy knows the time is short.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.348]  And we've got to wake up as many people as we can before things go to the next level.
[00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:15.869]  Or we could reverse that takeover.
[00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:19.090]  But what was the point I was making about... The little things.
[00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:20.851]  Oh, the little things.
[00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:26.513]  Listen, we're taking articles that men and women are writing on that website from all over the world.
[00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:28.434]  Every race, color, you know, creed.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.762]  And that's the key.
[00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:31.283]  Not just what
[00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:47.929]  We're doing it at PlanetInfoWars.com, but setting up a system where whatever's top voted shows up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.611]  So again, we're in beta right now, folks.
[00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:54.814]  That's why it's so important to spread the word about PlanetInfoWars.com and everything we're doing.
[00:11:55.234 --> 00:11:55.694]  Absolutely.
[00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:56.434]  Absolutely.
[00:11:57.295 --> 00:12:02.318]  Well, the next question actually has to do with Mitt Romney as a likely Republican nominee.
[00:12:02.478 --> 00:12:06.080]  So is Mormonism going to be related to the global elite?
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.582]  Is that going to come into play in any facet?
[00:12:09.244 --> 00:12:19.844]  Well, I think Mitt Romney is first and foremost a vulture capitalist, which is in the same family as a crony capitalist.
[00:12:20.084 --> 00:12:20.986]  He's a monopoly guy.
[00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:30.017]  His fruits are open borders, abortion, restrictions on the Second Amendment, carbon taxes.
[00:12:30.057 --> 00:12:31.618]  That's what he does when he's in power.
[00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:33.778]  His rhetoric, a lot of it's really good.
[00:12:34.418 --> 00:12:35.938]  But that's not what Mitt Romney's going to do.
[00:12:35.998 --> 00:12:38.379]  Kind of like Justice Roberts voted for the plan.
[00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:39.719]  It's like, well, he's a Republican.
[00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:45.520]  Well, because the insurance companies wrote this, their stocks are up, they want this.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.661]  They get to cut the kind of care you get, charge you more for less, make you buy the product.
[00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:51.361]  Tell you when to die.
[00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:53.662]  Tell you when to die, the death panels, exactly.
[00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:55.583]  Well, Christy, it's not just me ranting.
[00:12:55.603 --> 00:12:56.623]  Give us your take on all this.
[00:12:56.863 --> 00:12:57.884]  You've been here about a month.
[00:12:57.904 --> 00:12:59.324]  You're doing a really great job.
[00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:00.525]  Got a lot of energy.
[00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:02.005]  We've kind of just thrown you in the deep end.
[00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:03.826]  What do you think?
[00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:09.589]  I mean, politically, because I never, when I interviewed you, you know, you seemed interesting, but they'd already interviewed you.
[00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:10.669]  I think we did like a 10 minute interview.
[00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:12.650]  I never even found out your political views.
[00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:19.373]  I'm just kind of, hey, here's the stuff, social network, moderated, you know, no hacking, no, no porn.
[00:13:20.073 --> 00:13:22.676]  And you know, we're not going to call for, you know, killing races of people.
[00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:24.398]  But it's pretty much wide open.
[00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:30.224]  Now that you've been, well, A, what were your views before and now a month here, what are your views now?
[00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:31.986]  It's a really fascinating question, actually.
[00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:40.855]  You know, you take the political talking points that you hear on all news sites and you utilize those.
[00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:55.840]  And so you realize that that's all they are, just talking points, that you're really not delving into the reason that they're there, or even paying attention to the fact that you're getting kicked in the butt no matter who you vote for, if you're president, Republican or Democrat.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.041]  It seems to just keep going in that one direction, no matter what's going on.
[00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:07.482]  So politically, I would have to say that I was very close-minded in terms of understanding how the world works.
[00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:08.803]  I'm still not there.
[00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:12.985]  But yeah, it's eye-opening, especially moderating comments.
[00:14:13.045 --> 00:14:16.367]  You see what people are saying and you see what they're... But you're totally already there!
[00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:22.652]  I learned so much from the comments, how trolls operate, but also nuances, how smart folks are, the points they make.
[00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:24.253]  Serpico said that today.
[00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:28.076]  He said, I love going to websites and reading the thought-provoking ideas.
[00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:34.280]  Because people, really a lot of smart folks out there, and there's the system and the trolls like, don't, don't, don't, don't do that.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.402]  But you have, I mean, you do have deep understanding.
[00:14:37.663 --> 00:14:42.366]  I mean, the things you, everything you always say really has piercing clarity and boiling it down.
[00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:46.189]  I mean, I could spend an hour trying to describe something, but you just did it.
[00:14:46.729 --> 00:14:49.131]  The mainstream media wants something to be one dimensional.
[00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:57.409]  Instead of, you know, two-dimensional, they don't want you to look layers within or even ask, where does something come from?
[00:14:57.449 --> 00:15:01.052]  Well, what's fascinating is actually my fascination with the healthcare industry.
[00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:04.175]  I actually was pursuing to go to med school before I got this job.
[00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.897]  That was one of my aspirations.
[00:15:05.997 --> 00:15:09.159]  And I've decided I don't want anything to do with the allopathic system.
[00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:15.865]  I think it's all about pharmaceuticals and pushing this agenda 21, essentially, which at the time I had no idea about.
[00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:17.927]  But the idea being that people
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.820]  We're good to go.
[00:15:41.846 --> 00:15:43.326]  Essentially, nobody cares.
[00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:45.327]  Like, nobody cares enough to ask those questions.
[00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:49.888]  And then coming here... And it's so stupid because these people that don't care, it's affecting their family.
[00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:50.648]  Absolutely.
[00:15:50.828 --> 00:15:55.469]  And it's mind-boggling to think that nobody would even ask that question.
[00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:57.329]  And then when they do, they're discouraged.
[00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:58.770]  See how smart she is?
[00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.930]  Do go on, Alex.
[00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.751]  Oh, do go on.
[00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:04.311]  No, you're doing a good job.
[00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:05.111]  No, I'm serious.
[00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:05.971]  Everybody's got it.
[00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:07.532]  And I'm the same way.
[00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:08.712]  I'm self-deprecating, but...
[00:16:10.356 --> 00:16:16.520]  Look, we all recognize inherent truth, and we recognize we're not getting it from the mainstream media.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:25.645]  I mean, they'll be accurate about a plane crash here or there was a fire there, but they'll take some issue about, well, Assad's mean, and we're going to get rid of him.
[00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:27.926]  And it's like, but you admit you're using al-Qaeda on them.
[00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:29.627]  I mean, I'm no rocket scientist.
[00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:34.030]  You're telling me give them my way of life and be a slave because of al-Qaeda, but you work with them?
[00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.450]  Right.
[00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.150]  I mean, I just keep, that's all I can talk about.
[00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.032]  It's just 9-11 being an inside job, all of it.
[00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:40.672]  I mean, there it is.
[00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:41.533]  Just proof.
[00:16:41.873 --> 00:16:46.237]  Well, I hate that terrorists have become one of those, like, gourmet as to food.
[00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:49.779]  I mean, it's just, it's overused and it's a fear monster.
[00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:52.442]  Yeah, like Chef Boyardee dog food crud.
[00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:54.323]  And they says, gourmet!
[00:16:54.423 --> 00:16:55.804]  And it's got a guy with a white hat on it.
[00:16:55.824 --> 00:16:57.465]  So it must be really good.
[00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:58.126]  Absolutely.
[00:16:58.146 --> 00:16:59.347]  And that's what they've done with terrorism.
[00:16:59.847 --> 00:17:02.189]  In the name of fear, you're willing to give up all your rights.
[00:17:02.249 --> 00:17:03.890]  Like, starting with the TSA.
[00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.094]  Like, those kind of ideas, those kind of issues.
[00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:07.775]  Exactly!
[00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:10.758]  All we're doing is unplugging from this BS system.
[00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:12.300]  It doesn't even mean we have all the answers.
[00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:17.206]  How many questions are we... I've got to leave in... I think we're at question 3 right now.
[00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.889]  I've got to leave in 20 minutes to go see my grandmother.
[00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:22.291]  That's right, I'm a good person on Friday night.
[00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:23.493]  I'm going to see my grandmother.
[00:17:23.973 --> 00:17:25.095]  Filet mignon and everything.
[00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:25.992]  That's right.
[00:17:26.032 --> 00:17:27.753]  I only see her about once a month.
[00:17:27.773 --> 00:17:29.434]  She likes steaks, and I'm going to bring her a steak.
[00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:30.295]  That's awesome.
[00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:31.235]  You actually heard me.
[00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:35.317]  You were coming in there, and some of my wife said, honey, will you get her a steak?
[00:17:35.337 --> 00:17:36.258]  Because she likes a steak.
[00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:39.099]  And we're all going to drive over with the kids and hang out with her.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.120]  Sounds fun.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.581]  That's about all my grandmother will eat.
[00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:42.641]  She hardly eats.
[00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:45.343]  I tell you, I don't know how that woman, she doesn't eat anything.
[00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:45.883]  Like a bird.
[00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.424]  Yeah, she is like a barber.
[00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:49.345]  You bring her a little filet, she'll eat it.
[00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:49.846]  Oh yeah.
[00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:50.446]  Anyways.
[00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:53.488]  Well, the next question actually is from Ian.
[00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:58.412]  He says, I recently saw a picture of a drone that was used in a news article on the back.
[00:17:58.632 --> 00:18:01.654]  It had a NASA symbol.
[00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:06.277]  And I know that NASA has stopped sending ships to the space station.
[00:18:06.738 --> 00:18:11.341]  Does this mean that NASA is no longer doing that and instead they're working with the National Defense?
[00:18:11.977 --> 00:18:13.798]  Well, great question.
[00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:23.544]  NASA, since it was set up under the office of the President in the late 40s, has always been a military operation.
[00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.746]  And so much of the secret government is actually under NASA.
[00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:35.711]  The space program was only their PR campaign to sell you on budgetary funding, conservatively
[00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:42.666]  It was about 80% until the last few years of NASA funding went to secret projects.
[00:18:43.146 --> 00:18:44.568]  Like, oh, secret launch of NASA.
[00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:46.049]  Now it's over 90%.
[00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:54.957]  And the 1930s technology of Werner Von Braun, who was the big Nazi expert, he drew and designed the space shuttle in the 30s.
[00:18:54.997 --> 00:18:57.700]  Right before Hitler had come to power.
[00:18:58.928 --> 00:19:01.210]  He became his head of projects.
[00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.332]  So he came over to the U.S.
[00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:04.072]  in the 50s.
[00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:07.696]  He was taken actually after World War II in the 40s, 45 to be technical.
[00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:11.739]  And you've got the Goddard Space Center.
[00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:12.940]  He was also a big Nazi.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.122]  So it wasn't just Nazis in that.
[00:19:15.142 --> 00:19:16.543]  It was Nazis over intelligence.
[00:19:16.563 --> 00:19:17.684]  They said, oh, we like your model.
[00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:18.164]  You're the boss.
[00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:22.669]  They actually took about 14,000 top Nazis over here to run everything.
[00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.950]  Including Nerve Gas.
[00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.190]  Paperclip?
[00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.491]  Is that Project Paperclip?
[00:19:25.812 --> 00:19:26.432]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:26.472 --> 00:19:27.794]  A Ratline paperclip.
[00:19:28.054 --> 00:19:33.800]  But they also would have the Nazis run the programs to bring some young troops in and Nerve Gas them in a chamber.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.762]  Just to have the Nazis see if they could get US
[00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:37.843]  U.S.
[00:19:37.903 --> 00:19:39.785]  doctors to go along with it.
[00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.927]  Well, we've got to kill these troops because if we get hit with nerve gas, millions will die.
[00:19:44.248 --> 00:19:45.289]  It's for the greater good.
[00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:47.510]  So they killed foster kids, everything.
[00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:53.414]  But the Nazis knew it was like how to get somebody into evil in the name of good, you know, the greater good.
[00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:56.917]  Like that film on vaccines that we carry at Infowars.com.
[00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:00.900]  It's called The Greater Good because that's the big, the big sick joke.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.882]  But it's a whole other area of discussion.
[00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.804]  People are like, oh, we don't hear about the Nazis or the ultimate evil all day.
[00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:15.992]  No, there's lots of evil governments, but the Nazis, the system they developed came out of eugenics in England, and the government here was a big fan of that, predominantly.
[00:20:16.052 --> 00:20:18.913]  So, like, the Nazis were like rock stars.
[00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.355]  And they took them over here and put them in everywhere.
[00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.356]  But to answer the space program question...
[00:20:24.577 --> 00:20:26.038]  NASA's involved with Google.
[00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:27.918]  NASA's involved with the NSA.
[00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.879]  NASA is just kind of a PR name.
[00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:32.940]  Because everyone thinks it's cool to go to space.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.601]  I mean, it's kind of like a NASCAR guy.
[00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:38.062]  He's got all these patches on him, and the big patch on the shadow government's NASA.
[00:20:38.402 --> 00:20:41.363]  But it's a bunch of patches that make up the shadow government.
[00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:43.624]  You should draw something like that.
[00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:45.064]  I like all your doodlings.
[00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:47.045]  I mean, it's more like Space Command.
[00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:51.107]  Space Command's actually over the whole military, Colorado Springs, NORAD.
[00:20:51.927 --> 00:20:57.409]  All of that is... NASA's just one logo of the secret government.
[00:20:57.769 --> 00:20:58.710]  Gotcha.
[00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.270]  So, it's always been secret.
[00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:06.292]  And now, since you're not into space travel, it's not cool anymore, they'll show you simulated space travel.
[00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:07.113]  It's all drone.
[00:21:07.493 --> 00:21:12.355]  Hundreds of drone, Black Manta spacecraft, DU, SABO rounds, Meteor guns.
[00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:16.499]  Decapitation networks to be able to knock out every world leader in one hour.
[00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:17.780]  They had that in 1979.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.683]  I've interviewed the former head of Star Wars, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:21:21.444 --> 00:21:23.466]  People don't think Star Wars started until the early 80s.
[00:21:23.906 --> 00:21:31.514]  I mean, it's just a huge secret government program, pretty much an off-world technology, technological breakaway civilization.
[00:21:32.034 --> 00:21:35.937]  We don't even know how thousands of astronauts have died in secret missions.
[00:21:36.017 --> 00:21:37.057]  That's a conservative number.
[00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:46.944]  I've talked to former top NASA people who I've been friends with for decades, well, 15 years, who you can watch in the Apollo program or on the front line, like up there running things.
[00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:48.765]  One guy lives outside Austin.
[00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:51.187]  His name's Raymond Teague.
[00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.748]  Well, he's hard to get on air.
[00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:53.408]  I imagine.
[00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:55.110]  Plus, he's got heart trouble and stuff.
[00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.271]  And the thing is, he'll tell you stuff in private.
[00:21:57.351 --> 00:21:58.912]  Once he gets on air, it's almost like conditioning.
[00:21:58.932 --> 00:21:59.773]  He can't even talk about it.
[00:22:02.575 --> 00:22:03.817]  They went to the moon and beyond.
[00:22:03.857 --> 00:22:09.062]  The point is that what we were shown with the moon technology, a lot of that was fake because they don't want to show you what they really got.
[00:22:09.082 --> 00:22:10.744]  Man, these are good questions.
[00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:11.525]  What's coming up next?
[00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:16.410]  Ron Paul is quoted as saying, nobody has a right to someone else's wealth.
[00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.453]  You have a right to your life and you have a right to your property.
[00:22:20.154 --> 00:22:21.975]  But education isn't a right.
[00:22:22.155 --> 00:22:23.336]  Medicare isn't a right.
[00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:25.197]  These are things that you earn.
[00:22:26.018 --> 00:22:33.863]  But isn't it hypocritical to say that when we support a right to fair trial or civil trial by jury that it's not hypocritical?
[00:22:35.704 --> 00:22:39.287]  Now, maybe I'm dense, but read me that question one more time.
[00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:46.551]  Essentially, Ron Paul states nobody has a right to anyone else's wealth, including education as a right, Medicare as a right.
[00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.130]  Yeah.
[00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:55.574]  But isn't it hypocritical to say that when we support a right to a fair trial and a civil trial by jury?
[00:22:56.114 --> 00:22:58.736]  I included this question because I honestly wanted your opinion as well.
[00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.177]  I read it and I thought, I don't know.
[00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.158]  I don't know what he's going to answer.
[00:23:02.198 --> 00:23:04.059]  That's a good philosophical question.
[00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:08.041]  There are all these anarchist capitalists.
[00:23:09.076 --> 00:23:11.437]  That just say no state, no nothing.
[00:23:11.497 --> 00:23:13.197]  Well, I mean, humans organize themselves.
[00:23:13.597 --> 00:23:15.418]  The question is how do you organize yourself?
[00:23:16.238 --> 00:23:21.639]  And so on one extreme, there's the argument that all good comes from collectivization, which we know is a nightmare.
[00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:23.680]  You have no privacy, no nothing.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.381]  Bunch of people sit around or get in a gang with clubs and make you work for them.
[00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:30.216]  That's what it turns into.
[00:23:30.256 --> 00:23:32.938]  Someone essentially takes over at some point.
[00:23:33.139 --> 00:23:33.559]  Exactly.
[00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.840]  That creates a power vacuum.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.702]  It always reverts back to the Law of the Jungle.
[00:23:37.062 --> 00:23:48.913]  So it's better to have good people organize themselves into an agreed-upon, super-limited government to protect themselves from the next country that's a big, centralized government that wants to come and make them slaves.
[00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:51.636]  And that's the 1776 model.
[00:23:52.116 --> 00:24:07.828]  And so if you're going to have a limited government, the individual better be involved and better show up as the final checkmate in the grand jury and the jury, which is supposed to be able to vote, but also grand jury, the regular jury and also the cartridge box.
[00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:15.434]  So there's a lot of ways to vote and we're supposed to be the judge of the law, you know, as well as do we think this was right morally.
[00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:17.406]  It's called jury nullification.
[00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:20.769]  So people that look at Ron Paul and say, that's not libertarian enough.
[00:24:21.229 --> 00:24:22.670]  I shouldn't have to go to jury duty.
[00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:28.676]  Well, no, what you should look at is how they've turned the juries into puppets being instructed by the judge instead of the other way around.
[00:24:29.276 --> 00:24:32.479]  And if you study our system, that's what we're at.
[00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:43.909]  I mean, I'd rather beat the government healthcare first and beat the gun control and beat the, you know, the globalization and all of this and the corporate welfare before I sit around and say, well, let's just get rid of juries.
[00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:57.128]  Because the globalists actually are funding one arm of the libertarian movement to do just that, an absolutely extreme mode that they only implement in certain areas where they want to be able to get away with what they've done.
[00:24:57.848 --> 00:25:05.214]  So it's a balancing act, but obviously more liberty, more... What you want is to make people
[00:25:06.508 --> 00:25:12.613]  Be more self-sufficient, because history shows that develops greater individuals.
[00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:18.518]  The systems that seek to destroy individualism are nightmarish and colorless and dull, but...
[00:25:19.639 --> 00:25:28.127]  But now they've already put people in a zombie state, dumbed them down, made them so unhealthy that you have to, as Ron Paul says, you're not going to get rid of it overnight.
[00:25:28.508 --> 00:25:40.659]  You're not going to just, so we're just trying to pull out of the gravitational pull of giant, like the sun, of giant government, total state control, and we're just trying to get the rocket ship out of there, and then we can debate
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:49.264]  After we survive what we're going to do, but sitting back and going, oh, I go to an anarchist meeting and I wouldn't be for any government.
[00:25:49.284 --> 00:25:50.825]  Really, you drove here on a government road.
[00:25:51.485 --> 00:25:54.587]  So you better discuss how we're going to, the system's already built.
[00:25:54.847 --> 00:25:55.087]  Right.
[00:25:55.828 --> 00:25:56.688]  It is predatory.
[00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:58.069]  It's going into retrograde.
[00:25:58.609 --> 00:25:59.990]  It's plummeting to earth.
[00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.692]  So we have to go with something that by increments, we got here by increments.
[00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:05.753]  Rome wasn't built in a day.
[00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:07.354]  We're going to get out of this by increments.
[00:26:08.632 --> 00:26:10.092]  Yeah, you can apply that to your life even.
[00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:11.193]  Just like losing weight.
[00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:13.173]  Aaron Dykes, you know all about that, right?
[00:26:13.193 --> 00:26:13.893]  92 pounds.
[00:26:13.953 --> 00:26:15.214]  Tangy tangerine.
[00:26:15.434 --> 00:26:17.274]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:26:17.294 --> 00:26:18.274]  But that's not the only thing.
[00:26:18.294 --> 00:26:20.555]  You had to consciously make an effort about what you did.
[00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:21.415]  It's little things.
[00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:22.135]  Absolutely.
[00:26:22.155 --> 00:26:23.216]  It goes back to the little things.
[00:26:23.776 --> 00:26:24.376]  That's the theme.
[00:26:25.096 --> 00:26:26.216]  Aaron behind the camera.
[00:26:27.597 --> 00:26:28.477]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:28.597 --> 00:26:29.077]  The U.S.
[00:26:29.097 --> 00:26:30.978]  has a lot of debt and so does Europe.
[00:26:33.178 --> 00:26:35.200]  So the question is, debt to whom?
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.866]  The big private banks seem to have financial problems, so they can hardly own all of that debt.
[00:26:41.106 --> 00:26:43.509]  Is there a global financial black hole somewhere?
[00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:45.150]  Maybe you can just elaborate.
[00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.792]  These questions are just incredible.
[00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.073]  Where is the debt?
[00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:50.255]  It's an incredibly complex question.
[00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:53.519]  It gets into monetary theory, how the whole system was set up.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:04.853]  But basically, because our monetary system is not in a tangible, measurable seashells or gold or silver or whatever it is, it's fiat, whoever controls the fiat issuance is king.
[00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:08.378]  Like the Rothschilds say, I care not who is...
[00:27:10.984 --> 00:27:15.605]  There was actually an article on Planet Infowars wrote, like I think today or yesterday, just about that.
[00:27:15.665 --> 00:27:17.046]  Basically whoever prints the money.
[00:27:17.706 --> 00:27:18.066]  Exactly.
[00:27:18.446 --> 00:27:23.628]  Lord Rothschild said, I don't care who the politicians are, I don't care who the king is, as long as I control the money, that's all that matters.
[00:27:24.388 --> 00:27:29.389]  So, basically you end up having two systems.
[00:27:29.449 --> 00:27:37.572]  You've got the real economy, and you've got the quote government, but above it you have the central bankers or the money changers.
[00:27:38.962 --> 00:27:46.645]  Who want to attack the real economy because they're monopolist and want to move it into the government system so it can be moved up to them.
[00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:55.288]  But they want to create an illusion to just have the people fighting with the government all day, not looking at that, not looking at that next, that next rail.
[00:27:55.928 --> 00:28:01.370]  And I'm oversimplifying this, but continuing is writing on the back of articles here.
[00:28:03.806 --> 00:28:04.046]  Sure.
[00:28:04.526 --> 00:28:06.007]  Well, I mean, I can do better graphics of this.
[00:28:06.027 --> 00:28:09.269]  I mean, this is all... No, no, I'm sure we can leave all this in, too.
[00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:11.490]  Let's just leave it all in there unedited.
[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:19.093]  But, I mean, you know, you've got humanity, you've got productivity, you've got ideas, you've got blood, sweat, and tears, you've got economy.
[00:28:19.733 --> 00:28:23.075]  And then you've got government that's telling us that, well, it's there to organize things.
[00:28:24.073 --> 00:28:27.634]  But it inherently is unaccountable, destructive, and lazy.
[00:28:27.674 --> 00:28:28.514]  That's just what happens.
[00:28:29.255 --> 00:28:39.778]  But you've got the banksters that understand this, the technocrats, and they're always trying to get this dependent, shut down, monopolistic, where only their buddies in certain sectors control it.
[00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:43.919]  So it goes into government, it goes back to them, and back to these guys at the top.
[00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:47.720]  But to ask the question is, what is the debt?
[00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:52.682]  You know, when a dollar is created,
[00:28:53.956 --> 00:28:55.857]  It's not really a dollar, it's a fellow reserve note now.
[00:28:55.897 --> 00:28:57.058]  It's not backed with anything.
[00:28:57.238 --> 00:28:57.478]  Right.
[00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:04.963]  You have to pay debt back to the Fed for allowing that to be created.
[00:29:05.204 --> 00:29:12.789]  Whereas previously, whether it was gold-backed or not, the government just issued it, and the dollar was just a symbol that you could use to exchange goods.
[00:29:13.629 --> 00:29:15.591]  Which makes a lot of sense if you're not engaged in barter.
[00:29:17.332 --> 00:29:18.733]  And this empowers the individual.
[00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:28.599]  But instead, with this Federal Reserve System, it empowers the banksters, who are all fraudsters and call themselves the Fed, they're not Fed.
[00:29:29.239 --> 00:29:30.440]  Oh, we can trust that, it's the Fed.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.600]  But again, I'm oversimplifying this.
[00:29:32.961 --> 00:29:35.182]  I mean, the basic question is, where is the debt?
[00:29:36.062 --> 00:29:42.945]  On average, about 76% of all of the taxes you pay, county, city, federal, end up going into slush funds.
[00:29:44.195 --> 00:29:45.196]  It's not even for pensions.
[00:29:45.276 --> 00:29:47.079]  It's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:51.163]  And the 24% or so goes into the budget that we hear about.
[00:29:51.224 --> 00:30:01.095]  And they want the budget, the banksters, to always be in trouble so they can have all these ads and TV shows about how you're in debt and you didn't pay enough and things are about to collapse.
[00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:04.289]  So that you get deeper and hocked of them.
[00:30:04.329 --> 00:30:05.431]  It's basically loan sharks.
[00:30:06.112 --> 00:30:11.602]  They are fraudsters, so they want to wreck the economy so they can come in with fiat money and buy it up after they've wrecked it.
[00:30:12.483 --> 00:30:13.284]  It's very, very simple.
[00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:14.306]  But it doesn't...
[00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:18.578]  It doesn't produce productive economies.
[00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:27.083]  And so if you look at Greece or any of these countries, they bring in a welfare system to create a dependent class who will beg for money and riot if they don't get it.
[00:30:27.343 --> 00:30:29.644]  But that's always blamed for the shortfall.
[00:30:29.985 --> 00:30:31.385]  It's almost never the shortfall.
[00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:43.853]  The shortfall is that the banksters will also put their people in, Goldman Sachs and others, into Ireland, Greece, the U.S., Argentina, over by Australia,
[00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:47.821]  The Kiwi, it'll pop my head in the place.
[00:30:48.842 --> 00:30:50.783]  What's the place everybody's moving to?
[00:30:51.204 --> 00:30:52.485]  Sometimes I can't think of the name of something.
[00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:53.345]  New Zealand.
[00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:56.988]  That's all run by Goldman Sachs people, the finance ministers, presidents.
[00:30:57.809 --> 00:31:00.851]  And then they come out and say, oh my God, the public's in debt, the country's bankrupt.
[00:31:01.131 --> 00:31:03.033]  But you always notice, oh, it's too big to fail.
[00:31:03.453 --> 00:31:05.315]  It's the six big banks.
[00:31:08.537 --> 00:31:10.799]  It's their 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:31:11.339 --> 00:31:12.260]  That's the black hole.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.880]  So people say,
[00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:15.610]  Where is it all going?
[00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.071]  Where's the black hole?
[00:31:17.391 --> 00:31:17.851]  Well, that's it.
[00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:30.176]  They create the black hole to destroy the real economy so they can stand over it as managers and saviors, making themselves the boss who will get you out of the crisis if you go into debt to them.
[00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:37.480]  But the debt was always created by them, and then their people engage in fraud to make you think that only they can protect you.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.440]  I mean, does that make sense?
[00:31:39.661 --> 00:31:40.081]  Absolutely.
[00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:42.822]  So, there's the black hole, there's all of it.
[00:31:43.842 --> 00:31:45.983]  You make the problem and you come in as the hero.
[00:31:46.643 --> 00:31:47.143]  Exactly.
[00:31:47.663 --> 00:31:48.744]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:31:49.144 --> 00:31:50.224]  There you go, she just pulled it down.
[00:31:50.584 --> 00:31:58.587]  You wreck society by design so that you can come in as the knight on shining armor.
[00:31:59.567 --> 00:31:59.807]  Wow.
[00:32:00.408 --> 00:32:00.648]  Wow.
[00:32:00.908 --> 00:32:03.569]  That's seriously hateful.
[00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:04.069]  Evil.
[00:32:04.749 --> 00:32:06.050]  Well, they want to be in control.
[00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.470]  Yeah.
[00:32:07.372 --> 00:32:08.333]  Yeah.
[00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:17.260]  Well, Alex, I have been wanting to ask you, do you know if they are using the H-A-A-R-P on the chemtrails?
[00:32:17.821 --> 00:32:21.464]  I live in Washington State and it seems our weather patterns here are getting worse.
[00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:25.868]  They spray heavy up here and it rains about three days after they spray the chemtrails.
[00:32:26.888 --> 00:32:28.348]  No, they want to bankrupt the country.
[00:32:28.408 --> 00:32:30.529]  They admit there's a weaponized weather program.
[00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:32.049]  They admit the program's real.
[00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:35.390]  A guy got a Nobel Prize in the 90s, early 90s for it.
[00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.451]  And they're trying to bankrupt this country, like $20 billion to move General Motors to China.
[00:32:40.931 --> 00:32:43.131]  I mean, yes, there is a weapons program.
[00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:44.232]  They do ionize it.
[00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:46.992]  That part is in the patents.
[00:32:47.112 --> 00:32:47.492]  It's real.
[00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:49.773]  We just don't know exactly what they're doing.
[00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:51.973]  We just know the program's going on.
[00:32:52.933 --> 00:32:54.234]  And I've been saying this 17 years.
[00:32:54.274 --> 00:32:55.634]  They didn't admit it until four years ago.
[00:32:56.488 --> 00:33:03.790]  And exactly what all the researchers said, barium, salts, aluminum dioxide, other, and then said, oh yeah, we're doing that, but it's classified.
[00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:12.693]  What they do is they add it to the jet fuel where the engines, and it disperses nuclei, and they do it in key weather, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:33:12.753 --> 00:33:15.093]  You can even see the patterns over the ocean.
[00:33:15.313 --> 00:33:20.895]  When you were a child, how long did a condensation trail, a con trail stay up there?
[00:33:21.829 --> 00:33:25.611]  I remember thinking, wow, it's so cool how they stay up here for so long.
[00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:30.454]  I didn't think they would, but I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, something like that, an hour.
[00:33:30.554 --> 00:33:31.094]  How old are you?
[00:33:33.015 --> 00:33:34.896]  You never ask a woman her age, Alex.
[00:33:35.497 --> 00:33:36.137]  Let's say under 30.
[00:33:36.517 --> 00:33:37.058]  Let's go under 30.
[00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:38.578]  Okay, I never even asked your age.
[00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.319]  No, the point is, I'm almost 40.
[00:33:41.843 --> 00:33:47.167]  Condensation trails dissipated in a matter of minutes, if not seconds, until the mid-90s.
[00:33:47.968 --> 00:33:51.391]  And now they persist, as they call them, and they stay there.
[00:33:52.411 --> 00:33:53.172]  It's not all planes.
[00:33:53.192 --> 00:33:57.516]  You'll have one plane right beside another plane coming in, and one's not leaving a trail, the other isn't.
[00:33:57.536 --> 00:34:00.698]  It depends what fuel additives they have, actually have spray planes.
[00:34:01.459 --> 00:34:02.059]  It's incredible.
[00:34:02.099 --> 00:34:07.103]  But this is going on, and it just shows how you let a secret government take over of mad scientists.
[00:34:07.143 --> 00:34:08.464]  They just dominate society.
[00:34:08.704 --> 00:34:08.905]  Yeah.
[00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.320]  Find out which ways they can do it.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:18.023]  Okay, so what would be one of the best things to do if they release the weaponized bird flu?
[00:34:19.463 --> 00:34:20.484]  Oh man, these questions.
[00:34:20.564 --> 00:34:21.744]  I should be doing these on the radio.
[00:34:21.824 --> 00:34:22.785]  Yeah, these are great.
[00:34:23.185 --> 00:34:24.725]  Or do a panel with Aaron Dykes.
[00:34:26.146 --> 00:34:26.846]  What to do?
[00:34:26.866 --> 00:34:34.910]  Yeah, but I like the fact that it's like fresh though, but then it's like wow.
[00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:37.051]  I have moved to the country.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:38.901]  Outside Austin.
[00:34:39.761 --> 00:34:42.164]  Because I'm not living in fear, I'm trying to live in control.
[00:34:42.184 --> 00:34:43.985]  Because I love my children.
[00:34:45.186 --> 00:34:55.976]  And the globalists really are pushing the idea in all the movies and culture, but also in government documents, that there will be mass plagues, weaponized Ebola, weaponized bird flu, mousepox for humans.
[00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:58.979]  This stuff kills like 85, 90 plus percent of people.
[00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:01.361]  Depending on which, some of them kill like 98 percent.
[00:35:02.426 --> 00:35:02.926]  If you get it.
[00:35:26.687 --> 00:35:27.608]  They're going to be spraying it.
[00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:29.329]  So I don't know how you escape it.
[00:35:29.489 --> 00:35:39.996]  I mean, that's it's it's what's so horrible about these people and how they say once they get a big enough police state in place or they think they can release this stuff and control the panic and pose as saviors on the news.
[00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:40.957]  They're going to do it.
[00:35:41.397 --> 00:35:44.599]  And the very newscasters that are compartmentalized are going to lose their family.
[00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:48.101]  They're reporting that the government's the good guy and everything.
[00:35:48.161 --> 00:35:49.202]  And it's all engineered.
[00:35:49.222 --> 00:35:54.265]  And then we have all these documents where they're where the very government posing as a savior is the one developing it.
[00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.367]  It's it's just it's just horrible.
[00:35:57.585 --> 00:35:59.906]  What do those reporters even do all day?
[00:36:00.106 --> 00:36:06.250]  I mean, like, how is it that they say they have slow news days when there's all kinds of documents?
[00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:20.137]  Well, the average reporter, like at CBS or NBC or ABC, the national, even if they're an affiliate, a lot of them are owned by those are owned by sub-corporations, they have news packages, have already produced video.
[00:36:21.418 --> 00:36:24.920]  And then all they've got to do is read the teleprompter and it looks like local news.
[00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:28.000]  It's the law to take vaccines when it's not.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.620]  People can look it up and find out it's a hoax.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.062]  Even Dr. Oz doesn't give the H1N1 vaccine to his kids.
[00:36:33.402 --> 00:36:35.002]  He's on record as saying that.
[00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:38.864]  I think that's because, morally, in the final equation, he knew how dangerous it was.
[00:36:38.884 --> 00:36:40.465]  He couldn't just sit there and go along with that fraud.
[00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:51.929]  But the issue is, I had the former owner of local NBC station, since I've lived here, he's been on TV, the head guy at CBS the other day, and they said, oh, we want to come by.
[00:36:52.895 --> 00:36:54.577]  And they got here and the questions were coming out.
[00:36:54.597 --> 00:36:57.000]  At the end they go, oh, by the way, this is for national CBS.
[00:36:57.621 --> 00:36:59.603]  I'd already figured that out, the questions they were giving me.
[00:37:00.063 --> 00:37:01.385]  It was on multiple subjects.
[00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:06.771]  And he goes, yeah, a big guru at CBS wanted me to come down here.
[00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:08.842]  I don't know.
[00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:28.582]  You know, head reporter.
[00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:29.183]  Right.
[00:37:29.243 --> 00:37:31.284]  You know, guy that manages CBS here locally.
[00:37:31.525 --> 00:37:33.286]  I think it's somebody like Sinclair.
[00:37:33.907 --> 00:37:35.048]  And he's not even a bad guy.
[00:37:35.068 --> 00:37:36.929]  He's just, well, you've hit the big time.
[00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:38.571]  I've been sent down here by the big guru.
[00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:42.994]  And you just see how you think it's local news.
[00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:43.655]  It's not.
[00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:47.038]  Because these guys know, do what the guru says.
[00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:49.080]  And go get the report for us.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.282]  And it's going to air in different regions and nationally.
[00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:55.025]  And there they are all day over there at CBS Local.
[00:37:56.874 --> 00:38:02.516]  Like six years ago I had the tape of that same CBS, before he was there, I'm not bashing him, saying mercury is good for your brain.
[00:38:03.837 --> 00:38:05.997]  So, you type in mercury good for your brain.
[00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:08.518]  Go ahead and take some arsenic pills while you're at it, why not?
[00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:09.639]  Well, it's weird.
[00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:15.261]  A tiny bit of mercury and arsenic, totally microscopic levels, I've talked to scientists, is actually needed.
[00:38:15.681 --> 00:38:20.183]  But not in the levels... Isn't it already in certain foods and things like that?
[00:38:20.203 --> 00:38:20.683]  Well, that's it.
[00:38:20.743 --> 00:38:22.324]  You need just tiny trace amounts.
[00:38:22.364 --> 00:38:25.105]  They're putting thousands of times what you'd want in there.
[00:38:26.618 --> 00:38:28.238]  Well, next question, Alex.
[00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:39.122]  You say that the elite want a cashless society, but the illegal drug and weapon deals and so on would be exposed if the money could not be tracked, or could be tracked then.
[00:38:39.622 --> 00:38:41.803]  So, that logic doesn't compute to me.
[00:38:41.843 --> 00:38:42.643]  Can you explain it?
[00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:48.640]  Well, they've got old programs they're running that are merging with new programs.
[00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:51.743]  And that's a point that I've thought about a lot.
[00:38:52.203 --> 00:38:56.947]  Regardless, the big mega banks who do launder most of the drug money on record, just look it up.
[00:38:57.228 --> 00:38:58.128]  It's all over the news, you know.
[00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:00.991]  Big Bank caught laundering $200 billion in drug money.
[00:39:01.551 --> 00:39:04.033]  No trouble at all, you know.
[00:39:04.053 --> 00:39:07.957]  Bloomberg, $376 billion laundered by Wachovia and Wells Fargo.
[00:39:07.977 --> 00:39:09.378]  I mean, just look at these headlines.
[00:39:11.047 --> 00:39:20.011]  But at the same time, they want to move to a cashless society because it's even a bigger business to charge you $5 like Bank of America wanted to do every time you use your own debit card.
[00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:20.671]  Remember that?
[00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:22.892]  And backlash killed that.
[00:39:22.912 --> 00:39:25.854]  But once they've got you there, they can track the whole economy.
[00:39:27.074 --> 00:39:28.895]  They can shut down whoever they want.
[00:39:28.935 --> 00:39:30.616]  They can get rid of the underground economy.
[00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.497]  But here's what's gonna happen with cashless society.
[00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.718]  You're still gonna have cash.
[00:39:36.158 --> 00:39:38.960]  You're just gonna thumbprint or face scan when you buy and sell.
[00:39:40.475 --> 00:39:42.217]  Or your sales tax bracket they're going to have you on.
[00:39:42.237 --> 00:39:43.178]  It's going to be graduated.
[00:39:43.678 --> 00:39:50.085]  And with all the new fat taxes and unhealthy taxes, because we're in socialized health care, everybody's paying after all.
[00:39:50.365 --> 00:39:54.729]  We have to monitor what you're eating to make sure that once you buy too much red meat, you're charged for it.
[00:39:55.478 --> 00:39:56.859]  So this is what they want.
[00:39:57.179 --> 00:40:05.065]  We're not there yet, but they're phasing us in to this program and they're trying to merge their old cash society with the cashless.
[00:40:05.605 --> 00:40:07.226]  So they're still going to have cash.
[00:40:08.747 --> 00:40:11.629]  And then they'll just waive all the regulations and laws for themselves.
[00:40:11.669 --> 00:40:15.732]  Like when you go take $1,000 out of the bank, they go, we're filing a suspicious report on this.
[00:40:15.752 --> 00:40:16.813]  What do you want all this cash for?
[00:40:17.253 --> 00:40:22.817]  But if you want to put $10 billion in there and you're a drug dealer, well, Wells Fargo will lease the planes for you.
[00:40:23.778 --> 00:40:24.638]  And run the drugs.
[00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:25.739]  No, no, I mean, that was on the news.
[00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:26.899]  Let me open the door for you.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.920]  Well, no, I mean, exactly.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.701]  I mean, they'll go get the planes for you.
[00:40:31.461 --> 00:40:33.302]  So I've talked to police.
[00:40:33.422 --> 00:40:38.004]  It's been in the news where they're not allowed to check into a bank where the drug dealers are depositing the money.
[00:40:38.304 --> 00:40:39.544]  They're just allowed to bust the drug dealer.
[00:40:40.205 --> 00:40:41.665]  That's just some low level drug dealer.
[00:40:42.205 --> 00:40:45.647]  That's just for the facade of busting some, you know, low level person.
[00:40:46.367 --> 00:40:47.448]  Keep the masses happy.
[00:40:47.588 --> 00:40:49.388]  Well, you got to do that to keep prices up.
[00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:53.150]  You can't have too many drug dealers, too many people distributing.
[00:40:54.355 --> 00:40:58.177]  Even if they're your distributor, they call those snacks.
[00:40:58.838 --> 00:40:59.858]  Hmm.
[00:40:59.898 --> 00:41:00.559]  Interesting term.
[00:41:01.379 --> 00:41:03.680]  Alright, last question to you, Alex.
[00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:07.603]  Here's the biggest question that can't be answered, but will be answered.
[00:41:08.483 --> 00:41:11.185]  What will push American citizens finally over the edge?
[00:41:12.706 --> 00:41:17.949]  Given that Obamacare was put into action earlier this week, that was quite a riot.
[00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.010]  What are your thoughts?
[00:41:20.566 --> 00:41:24.428]  This is a scientific tyranny run by psych warfare experts in their own words.
[00:41:24.488 --> 00:41:28.050]  So they know how to slowly, notice they're going to implement it over years.
[00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.490]  They're going to take their time killing us.
[00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:34.373]  And so they tell us, oh, it's going to be defeated, so we all lay down.
[00:41:34.413 --> 00:41:36.894]  Like, oh, NDAA, Obama's going to veto it.
[00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:38.215]  He wrote the thing.
[00:41:38.255 --> 00:41:38.895]  His lawyers did.
[00:41:39.255 --> 00:41:39.876]  He signed it.
[00:41:40.416 --> 00:41:43.397]  But he signed it on New Year's Eve, so you wouldn't feel bad.
[00:41:44.538 --> 00:41:48.720]  You know, it's kind of like a shot they give you that kills you, but it feels good when they do it.
[00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:53.252]  You know, like, oh, you're gonna have pleasure, you're gonna be dead in 60 seconds, but doesn't that euphoria feel nice?
[00:41:53.632 --> 00:41:54.653]  So you don't resist them.
[00:41:55.093 --> 00:41:56.794]  Or it's death by smiley face.
[00:41:57.495 --> 00:41:58.435]  It's like, I'm nice!
[00:41:58.755 --> 00:42:00.777]  Warren Buffett always poses with ice cream cones.
[00:42:01.217 --> 00:42:02.898]  Most photos, like, oh, ice cream!
[00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:03.819]  I'm non-threatening.
[00:42:04.379 --> 00:42:06.461]  Or Bill and Melinda Gates are always just superheroes.
[00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:07.762]  Oh, we're sweet.
[00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:12.645]  This is all part, I mean, real evil doesn't dress up like Darth Vader or Freddy Krueger.
[00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:14.686]  It acts all like an NPR thing.
[00:42:15.647 --> 00:42:15.687]  Hi!
[00:42:16.447 --> 00:42:18.489]  That's how you get a horse when you're taken to the glue factory.
[00:42:19.718 --> 00:42:20.759]  About a 20-year-old horse.
[00:42:21.319 --> 00:42:28.425]  Yeah, that old nag, you know, she ain't bad, did a lot of work, but she's old, and I'm gonna sell her off for dog food.
[00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:32.649]  They're gonna chop her hooves off and turn them into Elmer's glue.
[00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.151]  And you just, come on, Betsy.
[00:42:35.932 --> 00:42:38.914]  Come on, got some right here in the trailer for you.
[00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:41.897]  Yeah, there's a carrot in there, sweetheart.
[00:42:42.357 --> 00:42:43.719]  You go on in there, honey.
[00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:46.401]  They don't go, I'm gonna turn you into glue.
[00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:47.610]  The horse would run off.
[00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.033]  It's like, hey, you doing sweet cake?
[00:42:51.034 --> 00:42:52.336]  Come on in.
[00:42:52.416 --> 00:42:53.357]  It's all right.
[00:42:53.918 --> 00:42:57.943]  You see, I actually only a few times delivered cows to slaughterhouses.
[00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:06.200]  And, and they'll open up the, as I work for a large animal vet, a few times we had to be there shooting up vaccines just to follow regulations at the slaughterhouse.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.760]  Even though it wasn't.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.201]  And, and, and, you know, when they first bring them, you don't want them to get upset.
[00:43:11.281 --> 00:43:15.942]  You know, big trailers of cows, it's just like, all right, come on off cause you don't want to stampede.
[00:43:15.962 --> 00:43:20.883]  But if they don't do what you say, you give them a little cattle prod, but it's like, all right, everything's fine.
[00:43:20.903 --> 00:43:21.923]  You're going to enjoy this.
[00:43:22.942 --> 00:43:24.043]  And that's how they did it with horses.
[00:43:24.123 --> 00:43:25.604]  It's like, come on in here.
[00:43:25.624 --> 00:43:29.527]  You know, when they walk over to a horse that's broken its leg in a race, they don't come up and try to scare it.
[00:43:29.547 --> 00:43:31.949]  They're like, it's all right, it's all right.
[00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.131]  And they take the handgun and shoot it in the head.
[00:43:34.151 --> 00:43:36.793]  That's just, oh, we're NPR.
[00:43:37.213 --> 00:43:39.515]  We got a nice, friendly NPR voice.
[00:43:41.176 --> 00:43:42.017]  You see how that works?
[00:43:42.557 --> 00:43:43.678]  And so that's what it is.
[00:43:43.758 --> 00:43:45.119]  It's just all, ah.
[00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:47.481]  If we can break people out of their trance,
[00:43:48.513 --> 00:43:55.399]  We could collectively, at the grassroots, have the minions of the system realize that this is going to destroy their children and their future.
[00:43:55.879 --> 00:43:59.503]  That's the only hope, is accessing the ancient survival mechanisms of humans.
[00:43:59.863 --> 00:44:02.966]  But through archetypal programming, the system is able to shut that down.
[00:44:03.326 --> 00:44:04.547]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:05.027 --> 00:44:09.832]  So we're here just cutting through the signal with a direct, hey, they live, you sleep.
[00:44:09.892 --> 00:44:11.573]  And they want you to sleep so they can kill you.
[00:44:12.014 --> 00:44:13.094]  Wake up, truly live.
[00:44:13.835 --> 00:44:20.258]  But what will probably wake us up is if the globalists, they like to overdo it, they think they're gods, they understand how we work, but they're not gods.
[00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.059]  They cheat each other.
[00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:22.879]  They infight.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.601]  That's one of the biggest threats against their program.
[00:44:26.201 --> 00:44:33.404]  But then from the grassroots, from the proletariat as they call us, it's that they're going to implode things too fast and things will get out of hand.
[00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:35.265]  That's why they want to move gingerly.
[00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:35.986]  People will wake up.
[00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:40.308]  Because they're loading thousands of horses on to go get cut up for steaks to be sold in France.
[00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.133]  You know, they want to get all the horses on the train here.
[00:44:44.413 --> 00:44:45.354]  That's why they don't kill me.
[00:44:45.374 --> 00:44:47.356]  Because I'm kind of kicking and jumping around.
[00:44:48.737 --> 00:44:50.178]  They're like, never mind him.
[00:44:50.198 --> 00:44:53.341]  You get on that train, there's a bunch of carrots at the other end.
[00:44:53.822 --> 00:44:55.483]  I'm like, no, no, I saw what they do.
[00:44:55.563 --> 00:44:56.244]  They're like, you know.
[00:44:56.744 --> 00:44:57.144]  Oh man.
[00:44:57.485 --> 00:44:58.385]  Do you see the analogy?
[00:44:58.445 --> 00:44:59.606]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:08.772]  When you put it that way, it's really easy to... No, that's why they act real... The whole act of the sandals and the hippie stuff, they have lots of minions who just like the style.
[00:45:08.792 --> 00:45:09.632]  They're not really hippies.
[00:45:09.652 --> 00:45:11.053]  They're, you know, people that are into freedom.
[00:45:11.533 --> 00:45:14.055]  You take folks like Pianka of the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[00:45:14.455 --> 00:45:20.319]  I mean, he had like a 90% standing ovation crying when he said 90% will soon die, including my family.
[00:45:20.839 --> 00:45:24.761]  Airborne Ebola and other scientists all around the power group of, we're gonna kill everybody!
[00:45:25.802 --> 00:45:28.603]  I mean, they're just like these, it's scum, that's who they are.
[00:45:28.963 --> 00:45:33.764]  It's just the wild control of, we're gonna kill everybody, oh, it's so much fun.
[00:45:33.784 --> 00:45:36.345]  And like, the average person is like, what?
[00:45:37.305 --> 00:45:44.987]  But these are the scientist types selected out of all the scientists that came in who were normal, because they liked injecting, you know, things into rats to see what would happen.
[00:45:45.407 --> 00:45:48.628]  They were the 1% of the sickos told they were the elite.
[00:45:50.185 --> 00:45:54.909]  Those were told, you're not getting a PhD, or, okay, well you'll just go into this division that isn't actually running things.
[00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:57.871]  It was like I never had that J.P.
[00:45:58.191 --> 00:45:59.733]  Morgan, or no, it was Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:04.321]  I mean, I didn't even know she'd been one of the highest people in the company.
[00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:05.662]  I looked it up, it was true.
[00:46:05.682 --> 00:46:07.823]  She said it, she made this greater good, I talked about it earlier.
[00:46:08.864 --> 00:46:12.206]  And I was like, you know it's a master plan to kill everybody.
[00:46:12.226 --> 00:46:20.251]  She goes, it's funny, I had a Goldman Sachs meeting with the head guy from the big pharma, and he goes, I'm going to make $7 billion this year killing people.
[00:46:20.851 --> 00:46:24.053]  And he was getting off on it, and I went and investigated it and found out it's true.
[00:46:24.434 --> 00:46:29.717]  It's like anybody that breaks through to this level, you're not part of the club unless you like killing people.
[00:46:31.428 --> 00:46:37.272]  But see, she was like a high-level Goldman Sachs person making millions of dollars a year and everything, but hadn't broke through to that level.
[00:46:37.592 --> 00:46:40.114]  And this guy thought he was comfortable, and he just kicked back in her office.
[00:46:40.374 --> 00:46:42.995]  Yeah, we're going to make $7 billion this year killing these people.
[00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:44.496]  These vaccines.
[00:46:44.536 --> 00:46:45.397]  God, I love killing them.
[00:46:45.637 --> 00:46:46.478]  She's like, you're joking, right?
[00:46:46.538 --> 00:46:47.778]  No, I'm going to kill them.
[00:46:47.798 --> 00:46:49.620]  What do you mean, joking?
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.902]  You're a Goldman Sachs high-level vice president, managing director.
[00:46:52.922 --> 00:46:53.942]  We're going to kill some people.
[00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:55.503]  We're powerful.
[00:46:55.523 --> 00:46:56.264]  We kill people.
[00:46:57.145 --> 00:47:07.492]  I mean, that's why when Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped Paul Pott kill 30% of his population, goes up on a... I mean, people like David Rockefeller in hearings are like, Sir, you are, like, the most incredible person.
[00:47:07.512 --> 00:47:08.472]  You're like a rock star.
[00:47:08.733 --> 00:47:11.554]  Henry Kissinger's a rock star because he killed a bunch of people.
[00:47:12.235 --> 00:47:14.596]  But he did it bureaucratically and wimpily.
[00:47:15.057 --> 00:47:17.578]  And they love that whole... I'm ranting here.
[00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:19.039]  Last questions here.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.724]  I know this sounds wild, but we've broken through to the other side.
[00:47:23.764 --> 00:47:26.847]  We've discovered these vampires is basically what they are.
[00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:29.329]  They're like a cat playing with a mouse.
[00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.932]  And I sit here watching them do this to humanity.
[00:47:32.072 --> 00:47:34.134]  I don't want to sit here and watch them get away with it anymore.
[00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:34.575]  Right.
[00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.766]  I want to rout these people.
[00:47:36.806 --> 00:47:41.267]  They came up with this scientific passive, you know, I'm in a pink outfit.
[00:47:42.328 --> 00:47:43.348]  That's a camouflage.
[00:47:43.368 --> 00:47:45.529]  The ultimate camouflage is they're acting non-threatening.
[00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:49.831]  These are ravenous, demonic, psychopathic, killing wolves.
[00:47:49.851 --> 00:47:51.872]  Well, to the average person, we don't comprehend that.
[00:47:51.892 --> 00:47:53.613]  Like, I don't want to kill anybody.
[00:47:53.713 --> 00:47:54.913]  I have no desire to kill anyone.
[00:47:54.973 --> 00:47:56.534]  So why would anybody else want to do that?
[00:47:56.554 --> 00:47:58.034]  You just don't realize the power of it.
[00:47:58.234 --> 00:47:59.575]  I guess I'm not that high up yet.
[00:48:01.255 --> 00:48:04.219]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for coming on and answering these questions.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:04.580]  Thank you!
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.162]  I mean, I know that was like 40 minutes.
[00:48:06.182 --> 00:48:06.943]  That was wonderful.
[00:48:07.725 --> 00:48:09.647]  Again, I'm Christy Hightower with Planet InfoWars.
[00:48:09.707 --> 00:48:14.515]  Send all of your questions to the Ask Alex group at Planet InfoWars and till next time!
[00:48:15.216 --> 00:48:17.038]  And we're going to start a lot of other stuff, too.
[00:48:17.058 --> 00:48:21.101]  I mean, we're trying to get the articles you write up on TheMainInfoWars.com, PrisonPundit.com.
[00:48:22.222 --> 00:48:23.123]  Give us your ideas.
[00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:24.144]  Help us spread the word.
[00:48:24.464 --> 00:48:25.806]  Christy, it's good having you on board.
[00:48:25.826 --> 00:48:26.366]  Wonderful.
[00:48:26.626 --> 00:48:29.889]  Aaron Dykes, you've got something big coming out next week.
[00:48:29.929 --> 00:48:30.770]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.191]  It has to do with the skulls that were in here.
[00:48:32.772 --> 00:48:33.332]  It's big.
[00:48:33.493 --> 00:48:33.973]  It's big.
[00:48:34.213 --> 00:48:34.854]  Big secrets.
[00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:36.016]  Oh, awesome.
[00:48:36.056 --> 00:48:39.742]  That was one of the questions I, you know, we only have so many questions we can ask at a time.
[00:48:39.762 --> 00:48:43.629]  Well, it was supposed to come out earlier this week, but it's an ambitious project.
[00:48:43.729 --> 00:48:43.990]  Okay.
[00:48:44.971 --> 00:48:45.492]  They're excited.
[00:48:45.953 --> 00:48:46.254]  Awesome.
[00:48:46.534 --> 00:48:46.835]  All right.
[00:48:46.915 --> 00:48:47.255]  Thank you.
[00:48:47.596 --> 00:48:48.017]  Absolutely.
