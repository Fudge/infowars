[00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:09.630]  From coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.477]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:28.360]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.954]  Well, we are live, ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from the Orlando Hotline Center that in its decades and decades of history has never sold out.
[00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:46.996]  How many?
[00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:48.576]  Hey, folks.
[00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:50.397]  You know what?
[00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:55.939]  When we come back from break in the next segment, because some stations don't carry this segment, I'll ask that question, but I'm curious.
[00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.160]  How many years has this been here?
[00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:04.246]  50 plus years it's never sold out and it is a sellout crowd here tonight.
[00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.648]  We've got the doors open and people starting to file in.
[00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:16.254]  We're about two hours away from the kickoff of my speech and a documentary film I'm going to premiere and a lot more here in Orlando.
[00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.341]  8-10, and the great crew that's here.
[00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.302]  I really enjoy all the shows that are on the air here.
[00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:30.786]  I really like this affiliate, and I like the fact that the program director and station manager, Carl, actually is the type of guy that'll actually call people up and talk to them.
[00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:32.147]  So he's an interesting fella.
[00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:39.811]  I had to come out here and meet him, and about six months ago or so, I said, yeah, I'll come out there and speak to you guys, because he asked.
[00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.914]  And now it's got me in trouble, because we've got over 100 AM and FM affiliates now, and they're all saying, you will come to our town.
[00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:49.578]  You know, we're on in Tampa, we're on in three or four other stations in Florida.
[00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:51.520]  They're all like, why are you not coming here?
[00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:55.785]  Well, I will not allow the TSA, when I'm with my family, to grab their genitals.
[00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:57.488]  That's un-American.
[00:01:57.648 --> 00:02:01.613]  In America, the new American flag will be someone's genitals being squeezed, I guess.
[00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:03.175]  No, I'm serious.
[00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.517]  Like an ostrich having its genitals squeezed.
[00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:07.479]  Excuse me, I'm not trying to be funny, it's disgusting.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.945]  And so I'm driving in an RV, so I barely got enough time to then race back to Austin.
[00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:21.794]  So I spoke in Dallas and speaking here is kind of a beta test, but I do intend to try these trips every two months or so and try to visit five or six affiliates on each swath.
[00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:33.925]  Through the country but the future I probably bring my children with me on every trip because let me tell you that turns into a three-ring circus your wife your three children and the two French Bulldogs Hurdling down the road.
[00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:36.527]  All right in the next two hours.
[00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:41.011]  I plan on getting some of the local talk show hosts and also we are change
[00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:51.301]  Activist group from right here in Florida who they're in Pinellas County a million people in that county just got the fluoride taken out last year.
[00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.885]  I plan to try to get them to pop in some of the folks that were coming through.
[00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.707]  Coming up in the second hour today.
[00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.768]  And I will be giving my speech, Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.869]  But after the break, I'm going to get into the news.
[00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.451]  Here it is, out of the Jerusalem Post, also Ynet News.
[00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:12.713]  It's also in Haratz, over in Israel, or Haritz.
[00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.754]  People always correct me, potato, patata, Haritz, Haratz, whatever.
[00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:17.335]  But here it is, U.S.
[00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:19.856]  to announce aerial blockade of Syria.
[00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.146]  Now we heard that eight, nine months ago.
[00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.247]  It wasn't a war.
[00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:29.871]  It was just drones and jet aircraft blowing up the country and putting Al-Qaeda in charge.
[00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.734]  And I'm told that I love the Muslim extremists because I don't want to put Al-Qaeda in charge.
[00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:36.856]  That's common sense would show insane.
[00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:40.579]  But we're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:41.300]  It's a big deal.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.300]  It's another war.
[00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:58.169]  And what happens is the corrupt interests that run our country send in proxy armies, basically Saudi Arabian terrorists and others, Wahhabis, and they then attack, they then attack these countries like Libya and Syria.
[00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.611]  And I'm not saying Gaddafi or Assad are good people.
[00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.773]  The point is those were stable regimes that were even working with the West in many cases.
[00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:11.417]  And then they put the extremists in and destroy the country and start ethnic and religious cleansing and the Christians get thrown out.
[00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:13.979]  And that's what Al-Qaeda has said in Syria.
[00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.340]  They said, we're going to kill the Christians.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.221]  We're not going to just kick you out if we get you.
[00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:17.962]  We're going to kill you.
[00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:24.166]  Of course, Christians have been there since the time of Paul, who was on the road to Damascus and getting knocked off his horse.
[00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:25.948]  That's 2,000 years ago, roughly.
[00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:27.088]  But no more.
[00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.673]  No more, because we have to put Al-Qaeda in to kill the Christians, because we're fighting the Muslim extremists.
[00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:39.432]  And again, I'm anti-America because I don't want the TSA going in my pants and I don't like Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:40.913]  But there you go.
[00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:42.675]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:43.396]  Huge news!
[00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:47.719]  Another giant war ahead of an attack on Iran as well.
[00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.900]  We'll be covering that after the break.
[00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:52.043]  Also, World Bank wants to control the high seas.
[00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:55.026]  And this is just a Jet 21 over the oceans.
[00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.507]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:04:56.527 --> 00:05:02.414]  And also, all over the U.S., England, Canada, you name it, parents are being arrested if their children draw images of guns.
[00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.237]  The nanny state is the enslavement state.
[00:05:05.257 --> 00:05:10.003]  It's all coming up today, the 26th of February, this Sunday.
[00:05:10.023 --> 00:05:10.403]  Stay with us.
[00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:15.205]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:23.647]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:28.428]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:39.830]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.473]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:49.973 --> 00:05:55.015]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:55.415 --> 00:06:02.598]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:02.898 --> 00:06:05.659]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:18.174]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:24.796]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:40.880]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.645]  But I'm not coming to you from FEMA Region 6 as my Sunday radio show liner introduces me.
[00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:59.593]  That's Texas under the sixth region of the FEMA command system of the New World Order and NORTHCOM that is over the United States.
[00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:05.698]  No, I come to you from deep in the heart of Florida, Orlando, where they've got the
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.001]  Where they've got the big NASCAR race going on right now.
[00:07:12.922 --> 00:07:16.343]  And they've also got Obama here for the NBA All-Star game.
[00:07:16.643 --> 00:07:22.885]  But I am here to give a speech after the radio show to a capacity crowd of over 1,000 people.
[00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:41.066]  They tell me that this Orlando Highlight Facility was built in the late 1950s, more than 50 years ago, and that it has never sold out this very nice auditorium in here.
[00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:42.647]  But tonight is different.
[00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:49.512]  In fact, they're even selling overflow tickets to the broadcaster's sports boxes up above us.
[00:07:49.592 --> 00:07:55.436]  So that shows that liberty and freedom are popular, and you can't suppress the signal of human
[00:07:56.136 --> 00:08:07.938]  Destiny and human desire to not be slaves, just like even if they engage in election fraud and block Ron Paul, it doesn't matter, he really is still winning!
[00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:14.247]  Even if he doesn't win the presidency, he wins by getting the word out.
[00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:36.012]  Now again, we just opened the doors, and I don't know, a few hundred people have come in so far to hear the radio broadcast and see it in the flesh, and we're gonna again watch this fill up the next two hours or so before I give my speech, and we're broadcasting to millions of people right now, as well, and also simulcasting video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:37.452 --> 00:08:44.557]  I want to say the great folks here at the Big 810 Talker in Orlando are just wonderful folks.
[00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:48.420]  I've met much of the crew, many of the talk show hosts, the local talk show hosts.
[00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:49.501]  Wonderful people.
[00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.363]  We're going to have some of them popping in in the second hour.
[00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:56.006]  And I want to say something here about all of our affiliates before I get into the news.
[00:08:56.426 --> 00:08:58.067]  I don't talk enough about the fact
[00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:22.420]  several issues here that we are on over a hundred AM and FM stations despite how quote radical and dangerous I am as much of the corporate prostitute media has said it shows that freedom is an idea whose time has come that more and more stations are picking us up but still to put up somebody on the radio that wants the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.902]  And we'll defend the Republic 110%.
[00:09:25.302 --> 00:09:28.145]  That is unprecedented.
[00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:37.954]  And so there is courage with our AM and FM affiliates to put this on the air, just like there's courage the last two years for XM, Channel 166, to put the weekday show on.
[00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:42.057]  Because as Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce...
[00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.488]  And I salute you for being here!
[00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:07.769]  You're awesome.
[00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.411]  Now, I salute you.
[00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:10.753]  I salute you.
[00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:14.217]  Now, I want to get into some of the news.
[00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:15.599]  Just huge news.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.687]  All of it is obviously off the charts and unfortunately is exactly what we've predicted.
[00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:22.789]  We're good to go.
[00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.312]  It used to be owned by President Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:45.475]  That shows how far the American spirit has come.
[00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:51.018]  That our message of liberty is resonating across this country.
[00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:55.301]  And we are now reaching more than 15 million people in the aggregate every week.
[00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:57.523]  That is not a testament to Alex Jones.
[00:10:57.803 --> 00:11:07.529]  That is a bellwether, a gauge, a yardstick, a measurement of the incredible awakening taking place worldwide!
[00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:14.312]  Now some of the news coming up.
[00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:15.453]  U.S.
[00:11:16.013 --> 00:11:18.234]  to announce aerial blockade of Syria.
[00:11:18.774 --> 00:11:23.176]  That's all over the Israeli, all over the Arab, all over the European, and in some of the U.S.
[00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:23.476]  news.
[00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:28.238]  Remember just four months ago Hillary Clinton said, oh we'll never attack Syria.
[00:11:28.878 --> 00:11:31.459]  And now they're saying this is not a
[00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:33.273]  War?
[00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:36.375]  No, this is not a war.
[00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:38.235]  We're just going to start bombing them.
[00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:42.077]  Because bombing people is not a war.
[00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:44.238]  Remember what happened eight months ago.
[00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:47.440]  Obama said to Congress, hey, I don't need your approval to
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:57.884]  Liberate Libya dropping 2,000 pound bombs all over the country and blowing up their cities and now killing at least 35,000 people they admit in ethnic cleansing and putting Al Qaeda in.
[00:11:58.164 --> 00:12:08.908]  He said, I have the UN's authority and put out a public statement saying I get my authority from the UN and I do this for the credibility of the United Nations.
[00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:12.129]  Even if you were for the war, at least call it a war.
[00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:14.109]  And get congressional approval.
[00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:15.990]  And Congress said, we love war.
[00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.710]  We want to vote for this, but you've got to come to us for authorization.
[00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.811]  And he told them, go to where the sun doesn't shine, I'm going to the UN.
[00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:27.872]  If that isn't treason, I don't know what is.
[00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:31.312]  He's saying our Congress isn't even a doormat!
[00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:36.773]  Our Congress is vestigial, ceremonial, and doesn't even exist!
[00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:40.534]  Does that make you angry out there?
[00:12:44.824 --> 00:12:45.945]  Let me hear your war growl.
[00:12:52.128 --> 00:12:53.009]  Let me hear it!
[00:12:56.911 --> 00:12:59.252]  That's not good enough, Private Joker!
[00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:03.214]  Now we're doing lines from Full Metal Jacket.
[00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:09.978]  I can't wait in the next hour and 45 minutes as this thing fills up for the kickoff at 7.
[00:13:10.018 --> 00:13:12.039]  We got over a thousand people in here and roaring.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.004]  On three, I want to say death to the New World Order.
[00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:19.685]  Death to tyranny.
[00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:22.167]  We will defend liberty.
[00:13:22.187 --> 00:13:25.290]  So we're going to say death to the New World Order on three.
[00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.652]  One, two, three!
[00:13:28.192 --> 00:13:30.634]  Death to the New World Order!
[00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:31.675]  Yeah!
[00:13:31.735 --> 00:13:32.095]  Ha ha!
[00:13:32.135 --> 00:13:37.900]  The system doesn't like that.
[00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:47.449]  By the way, I heard Doc Holliday, who has the show on Before Me Mornings here on A-10, our great affiliate in Orlando.
[00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:49.051]  By the way, I forgot to mention...
[00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:52.075]  The instant ratings, I love those.
[00:13:52.856 --> 00:14:04.187]  Now that the instant ratings are coming in, the people, you know, meters, when people agree to have a little meter in their car, they've also got billboards because all receivers actually transmit if they're AM or FM.
[00:14:04.848 --> 00:14:12.996]  And since he's been going in the last few years, everywhere we're on, even little stations, 810's a big blowtorch and always had pretty good ratings.
[00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:19.398]  That's why we took it from like number three or four to number one in the last instant ratings.
[00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:21.119]  Number one across the board.
[00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:22.519]  Ah, what do you think of that?
[00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:23.759]  You know why?
[00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:30.280]  Because it's not those stupid diaries that, quite frankly, the big industry secret is only the illegals fill out because they need the money.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.201]  And I'm not blaming them.
[00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:32.401]  I understand they need the money.
[00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:37.982]  But it's just that's why all the stations, you know, went to basically Spanish five or six years ago.
[00:14:38.342 --> 00:14:40.662]  Because that was the only folks on average filling out the diaries.
[00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:45.063]  Now that they have the instant meters in, they're actually finding out what people actually listen to.
[00:14:45.363 --> 00:14:53.445]  And we absolutely annihilated Lord Limbaugh, right up against him live, head-to-head, dominating and smashing him.
[00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:59.086]  And we'll do it everywhere we're on, if they'll put me on the field on big stations like 810.
[00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:02.786]  I will dominate neocon fake rhinos every day.
[00:15:02.806 --> 00:15:05.567]  And the system knows it!
[00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:10.469]  Let me tell you about neocon right-wing gatekeepers, folks.
[00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.074]  And again, Rush Limbaugh helped wake me up 20 years ago.
[00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:15.135]  I'm not even saying he's a bad guy.
[00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:23.611]  But he, you know, says there's no new world order, no world government, while the head of the UN two weeks ago called for world government, world taxes over everything.
[00:15:23.771 --> 00:15:26.472]  Jet travel, gasoline, money transfers.
[00:15:26.772 --> 00:15:35.895]  It's all over the Economist magazine, Davos, Switzerland, and he and others still make fun of anybody that talks about it.
[00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:44.619]  Like I pick up the Economist, or I play clips of the head of the EU calling for world government, or Obama calling for global government, or his staff, and they're like,
[00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:49.582]  Well, that's that kooky guy that gets angry about sovereignty and wants to keep his guns.
[00:15:51.103 --> 00:15:52.925]  You know when we're going to start really defeating tyranny?
[00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:56.427]  When we stop letting the left and right gatekeepers control us.
[00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:06.575]  And the good news is, even though the left and right told us there wasn't a world government forming, we were able to expose that it was happening, and now we've got a good chance of beating it.
[00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:09.677]  I want to give you some good news straight ahead, and then huge news.
[00:16:10.038 --> 00:16:11.099]  Your daughter draws a gun?
[00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:12.540]  You're going to try everything.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.684]  Back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:16:18.104 --> 00:16:22.587]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:29.313]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:16:29.793 --> 00:16:40.286]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:16:41.027 --> 00:16:45.153]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:16:45.493 --> 00:16:48.497]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:16:48.837 --> 00:16:51.499]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.880]  Now that's results.
[00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:59.726]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:05.431]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.331]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:17.738]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:22.605]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:23.386]  It's true.
[00:17:23.466 --> 00:17:28.032]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:17:28.553 --> 00:17:33.256]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:16.018]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:19:11.089 --> 00:19:16.510]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.491]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:29.692]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:19:31.613 --> 00:19:33.893]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.914]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:19:40.097 --> 00:19:43.980]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:47.823]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:19:48.543 --> 00:19:49.364]  Others don't.
[00:19:49.764 --> 00:19:51.646]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:53.427]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:56.249]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:19:56.589 --> 00:20:02.834]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:08.778]  Others don't.
[00:20:11.914 --> 00:20:14.756]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:18.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:31.426]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.649 --> 00:20:40.232]  And we are back coming to you from beautiful Orlando, Florida.
[00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:45.730]  And this reminds me why I like Florida.
[00:20:46.863 --> 00:20:55.966]  Man, we're staying just at some little hotel by the edge of a golf course, and if you go outside and there's, like, tropical birds hopping around and flowers everywhere, I like this.
[00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:57.687]  I like Central Texas.
[00:20:58.087 --> 00:21:02.508]  Austin's great, but it's been in a drought, and it's kind of like living in the middle of a Western movie or something.
[00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:05.569]  This is more like living in a jungle, so I love it.
[00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.850]  Good to be here with everybody under the loving eye of Disney.
[00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.612]  All right, I need to start getting into the news for all of our listeners out there, but
[00:21:14.412 --> 00:21:29.393]  Getting into positive news, we have to stop, and I'm going to talk about this in my speech tonight, letting the gatekeepers, just because they've got a fancy teleprompter and a fancy suit, or they're the big talk show host authority, dictate reality to us.
[00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:35.999]  And say, you can't talk about this, you can't question authority, or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:47.747]  If you question known government liars that have been caught lying thousands of times, if you don't trust big mega giant corporations that are in control of governments worldwide today,
[00:21:48.787 --> 00:21:51.208]  Then, you're a bad person for questioning them.
[00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:55.590]  No, that's what made America great was questioning and not trusting government.
[00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.950]  What did George Washington say?
[00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:04.634]  Government is like fire, a dangerous servant, and a fearful master.
[00:22:05.314 --> 00:22:12.537]  Now, they've said that the Southern Poverty Law Center and others would demonize somebody like George Washington today if he was alive.
[00:22:13.037 --> 00:22:14.778]  Well, they don't do it just because he's
[00:22:16.014 --> 00:22:18.015]  Alive in our hearts and minds.
[00:22:18.636 --> 00:22:19.296]  They do it.
[00:22:19.516 --> 00:22:20.517]  FEMA, the rest of them.
[00:22:20.577 --> 00:22:29.561]  I have the videos in films like Road to Tyranny that police officers and others have sent me, where it shows FEMA actually demonizing the Founding Fathers.
[00:22:30.022 --> 00:22:39.987]  And they had articles in Philadelphia newspaper just a few months ago, and BBC picked it up, asking the question, is the Declaration of Independence illegal?
[00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:41.488]  And they said, yes it is.
[00:22:42.168 --> 00:22:47.973]  Because it says you have a right to overthrow a corrupt government, and the government now says you don't have that right because they're God.
[00:22:48.433 --> 00:23:00.883]  It's about government dictating to you, and Madison Avenue and this whole manufactured plastic culture telling you what to think, how to dress, how to speak, trying to turn you into a plastic person.
[00:23:01.903 --> 00:23:03.284]  And so on the left and the right,
[00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:17.957]  These big globalist foundation-controlled shows have told you there's no corruption, that's a conspiracy theory, don't be involved, there's no global government, there's no CFR, there's no New World Order, there's no plan for international banks to take over.
[00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:22.661]  Now they admit open world private government taking over Europe.
[00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:25.957]  By megabanks that put their people in charge of those countries.
[00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:28.960]  Now talk about this ad nauseum because it's the key.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.222]  Open world government being announced.
[00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:38.729]  And because we didn't care about being attacked for decades exposing what the real agenda was, and because Ron Paul didn't mind being attacked,
[00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:46.653]  Because we all knew, as it came out in the open, as this agenda expanded, people would then finally listen.
[00:23:46.954 --> 00:23:50.316]  And now, because it's out in the open, people are listening.
[00:23:50.636 --> 00:23:55.479]  And we're moving into check, and the next move is checkmate against the globalists.
[00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:59.721]  But that doesn't mean that they can't put us in check, or checkmate as well.
[00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:01.442]  We're in the fight.
[00:24:01.882 --> 00:24:04.404]  That's the good news that I can give you here today.
[00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:05.826]  Let me give you one example of this.
[00:24:05.846 --> 00:24:09.171]  I'm going to move on to contemporary, important, big breaking news right now.
[00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:14.278]  You remember 15, 16, 17, 18 years ago or so?
[00:24:14.358 --> 00:24:16.862]  I remember when I was first politically active 20 years ago.
[00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:27.723]  The mainstream media would come out to people like Pat Buchanan and others and say, you shouldn't be running for president on defending the Second Amendment.
[00:24:28.044 --> 00:24:30.066]  Nobody wants to take your guns.
[00:24:30.787 --> 00:24:37.635]  Remember back when they would say, no one wants to take your guns, we just want to ban all the semi-automatics and make you turn them in.
[00:24:38.075 --> 00:24:43.919]  And have waiting periods, and make you lock them up in your house, and not have one in the house if you've got children.
[00:24:44.239 --> 00:24:54.765]  How many people remember 20 years ago, back when the mainstream media, who's not even mainstream anymore, they're the dead dinosaur media, would say, oh, we just want reasonable gun control.
[00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:56.606]  We don't want to take your guns.
[00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:57.387]  Remember that?
[00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:00.182]  You remember it.
[00:25:00.683 --> 00:25:01.663]  Okay, exactly.
[00:25:01.843 --> 00:25:02.784]  Everybody remembers it.
[00:25:02.864 --> 00:25:04.185]  And they still try it some today.
[00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:16.492]  But all the quotes of the Brady Center and the handgun control groups and all these people, they all bragged in their own documents that it was the individual abolition of firearms ownership.
[00:25:16.772 --> 00:25:23.096]  The UN, on July 7, 2000, put out an official report in New York at a convention they had, a meeting, a conference.
[00:25:23.636 --> 00:25:24.436]  A conclave.
[00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:30.197]  And they put it into UN law that their goal is global disarmament of the public.
[00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:30.918]  Here's the quote.
[00:25:31.758 --> 00:25:38.619]  Civilian ownership of any firearm threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:45.381]  They believe a power monopoly of government over you, absolute dictatorship of the state, is legitimate.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:52.284]  But the point is, they want your guns and they're saying, total abolition of individual ownership of guns.
[00:25:52.585 --> 00:26:01.551]  And the minute people stopped having debates about, oh, just be reasonable, let us restrict it some, and then come back a year later, let us restrict it some more.
[00:26:02.072 --> 00:26:08.256]  Oh, no, as soon as we got angry and took action, they're even repealing gun laws now in Canada.
[00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:11.338]  They just repealed the long rifle, or
[00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:31.785]  a long gun registry last week because they passed a gun registration and started using it to confiscate guns and the public got angry and took action in a system that's much harder to affect change and it was the first major gun law in the world outside of the U.S.
[00:26:32.005 --> 00:26:39.447]  reversed in the last hundred years that I know of and NRA and Gun Owners of America said the exact same thing
[00:26:39.787 --> 00:26:46.373]  The first victim disarmament piece of legislation reversed in a century outside of the United States.
[00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:47.934]  Think about that.
[00:26:48.014 --> 00:26:54.299]  We've reversed a few things here, but the first one outside of America, that's what I call 1776 worldwide.
[00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:01.045]  If we're gonna be free, we gotta have freedom worldwide.
[00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:19.023]  And the idea of freedom is so cool, so sexy, so hot, so awesome, so fantastic, so powerful, so alluring, that when you stack it up against tyranny and corruption and insider crony, anti-free market capitalism,
[00:27:20.267 --> 00:27:22.289]  When you stack freedom up against that, we win.
[00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:30.719]  So everybody that thinks it's impossible to defeat the globalists, it's impossible to lose when good men and women stand up and take action.
[00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:37.546]  I cannot stress that enough to you that we have got to take action and more of that coming up in my speech.
[00:27:37.586 --> 00:27:39.949]  We're having so many victories.
[00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:54.714]  Every time people stand up and bring the real medical literature about fluoride in our water, and the seven-fold increase in bone cancer, and the fact that the government's own scientists say take it out, but the special eugenics interests want it added to increase cancer and reduce fertility.
[00:27:55.054 --> 00:28:02.297]  In every city where people resist and resist and resist for at least three years, it's removed, and just a few miles away from us,
[00:28:03.317 --> 00:28:05.878]  In Pinellas County, right at a million people.
[00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:07.559]  Tampa is in that county.
[00:28:07.839 --> 00:28:14.401]  They removed fluoride from all of the water supplies.
[00:28:14.421 --> 00:28:18.903]  60 years of globalists spending money, millions of sometimes, to get that into the water.
[00:28:20.004 --> 00:28:21.084]  Because they love you so much.
[00:28:21.284 --> 00:28:23.105]  And all over the country, all over the world.
[00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:25.245]  In Calgary, Canada, they just removed it.
[00:28:25.646 --> 00:28:27.686]  In areas of England, in Europe, they're removing it.
[00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:29.467]  They're removing it all over.
[00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:31.328]  Now the globalists have struck back.
[00:28:32.355 --> 00:28:36.658]  The Globalist came in with millions of dollars in New Jersey and Arkansas.
[00:28:37.378 --> 00:28:42.301]  And they're trying it in every state right now and have now passed mandatory fluoridation by law.
[00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:46.283]  But now it's not just a recommendation or a contract.
[00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:47.524]  Now they're demanding it.
[00:28:47.804 --> 00:28:51.646]  Now it becomes a civil rights issue, a forced medication of the public.
[00:28:51.867 --> 00:28:53.447]  And so they're going to lose in court now.
[00:28:53.748 --> 00:28:57.190]  And now government openly wants lithium in the water and statins.
[00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.893]  We told you that was in documents years ago and showed you.
[00:28:59.953 --> 00:29:01.075]  Now they're openly pushing it.
[00:29:01.476 --> 00:29:06.483]  We'll be right back with the buildup towards war with Syria and Iran and a lot more.
[00:29:06.503 --> 00:29:08.827]  Stay with us live in Orlando, Florida.
[00:29:11.147 --> 00:29:18.130]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:35.998]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:29:36.238 --> 00:29:40.360]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.221]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:50.246]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:29:50.567 --> 00:29:56.651]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:57.932]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:29:58.152 --> 00:29:58.892]  It's incredible.

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.123]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:15.443 --> 00:30:16.044]  Number one.
[00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:19.506]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:19.766 --> 00:30:20.347]  Number two.
[00:30:20.627 --> 00:30:25.190]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:25.971]  It's true.
[00:30:26.271 --> 00:30:30.834]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:31.134 --> 00:30:31.695]  Number three.
[00:30:31.975 --> 00:30:35.257]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:35.557 --> 00:30:39.260]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.001]  Number 4.
[00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:42.604]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:43.004 --> 00:30:46.389]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:46.689 --> 00:30:46.909]  Number 5.
[00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.415]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:51.635 --> 00:30:56.401]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:56.681 --> 00:31:00.702]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:45.088]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:50.412]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:18.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:32.823]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:32.883 --> 00:33:33.364]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:33.424 --> 00:33:36.667]  Central and we come back Sundays of course 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:47.079]  Central that'd be 5 to 7 right here on the East Coast and then of course we have the weeknight five nights a week InfoWars Nightly News and when I'm not
[00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:47.880]  I think so.
[00:34:03.551 --> 00:34:05.955]  Sitting up there in the fanciest suit looking credible.
[00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:17.269]  It's about being credible and covering real information And we're expanding and building our news organization Thanks to all of you and your support and the great folks at the Big A10 right here in Orlando
[00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:31.774]  I really am excited that all of you came out for the first time in 50 plus years of this great auditorium.
[00:34:32.095 --> 00:34:37.445]  It is completely overflowing, sold out, turning away hundreds.
[00:34:43.473 --> 00:34:44.013]  Amazing.
[00:34:44.794 --> 00:34:46.635]  Liberty is popular.
[00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:49.017]  By the way, I'm going to have, again, a local talk show host in here.
[00:34:49.037 --> 00:34:51.198]  He was telling me about this a few days ago.
[00:34:51.218 --> 00:34:57.342]  I was a guest on his show, and I went and looked up the news articles, and it turned out it was true, but I still found it shocking.
[00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:07.769]  Doc Holliday was telling me that they have whole highways shut down for the NBA All-Star Game, and that they have checkpoints even in the business districts, and that they're
[00:35:08.029 --> 00:35:16.418]  They're blocking off the local businesses so they can't get any of the traffic and that they have motorcades for the NBA people.
[00:35:16.578 --> 00:35:19.582]  I actually saw one driving over here.
[00:35:19.602 --> 00:35:24.807]  I sound like Porky Pig.
[00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:26.369]  I'm speechless here.
[00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:42.333]  There were probably 10 or more motorcycle police like it was the president or something for a bus of NBA people driving down the highway like it's the Road Warrior and the citizens are going to attack them if they weren't there protecting them.
[00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:44.755]  Meanwhile, our tax money is paying for it.
[00:35:46.116 --> 00:35:46.697]  I checked.
[00:35:47.357 --> 00:36:00.325]  Your tax money here is paying for it, just like you pay for the billion-dollar sports stadiums, and then you're charged overpriced tickets, you're treated like garbage, and you pay for the motorcade protection from you, who's paying for them to look and act important.
[00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:01.846]  That's what this is all about.
[00:36:02.186 --> 00:36:06.449]  I've seen presidents, like when Obama comes to town, they shut down whole highways.
[00:36:06.549 --> 00:36:11.592]  I've seen him with like 50 cars protecting him like he's, you know,
[00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:14.554]  God or something, landing in town.
[00:36:14.874 --> 00:36:16.775]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:36:17.056 --> 00:36:24.301]  And all of it is done so that you see these leaders as actually leaders and not the puppets they are.
[00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:30.745]  While the real power elite, like the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others, do everything they can to hide their wealth.
[00:36:31.245 --> 00:36:35.908]  Every time David Rockefeller gets up to give a speech he goes, I'm just an old retired banker.
[00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:40.452]  I'm so honored that you're giving me this award.
[00:36:40.472 --> 00:36:43.454]  And you find out he set up every globalist organization out there.
[00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:48.758]  I set up all the eugenics organizations and I want to reduce the population.
[00:36:48.838 --> 00:36:50.259]  I'm just a little old banker.
[00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:53.562]  All right, continuing here.
[00:36:54.442 --> 00:37:10.108]  You remember eight months ago, well, a year ago, they overthrew Hazar Lubarik, the dictator that the banks that run this country, because I don't want to say we put in, but the people that took us over to the banking and government system, the folks that put him in charge, the torture and kill tens of thousands and all the rest of it.
[00:37:10.948 --> 00:37:12.488]  I'm not saying Hosni Mubarak's a good guy.
[00:37:12.528 --> 00:37:19.911]  The point is, the crooks that run our country, the foreign banks that have hijacked our nation, they put him there.
[00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:28.173]  They would send people there for him to torture, including American citizens, at the, quote, black sites, secret sites, ghost sites, as they call them.
[00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:30.314]  And then, they overthrow him.
[00:37:30.614 --> 00:37:34.635]  They send in the CIA and State Department people to overthrow him a year ago.
[00:37:34.895 --> 00:37:57.382]  They put the Muslim Brotherhood in, and they actually put Al-Qaeda-connected groups in, and now they're taking women's rights, Christians are being persecuted, and lecturing me that I've got to have the government take my rights, spy on me, grab my genitals at bus stops and train stations now, not just the airports, and take all my rights because Al-Qaeda is such a threat, while the stinking criminal banker
[00:37:57.742 --> 00:38:00.408]  Occupied government is putting Al Qaeda in.
[00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:07.143]  But they didn't stop in Egypt, getting out their old dictator and putting something in even worse to destabilize the country.
[00:38:09.028 --> 00:38:14.411]  Then they go into Libya, start bombing it for six, seven months, killing over 35,000 people.
[00:38:14.672 --> 00:38:16.192]  They bring in real Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:16.233 --> 00:38:17.773]  They fly up Al-Qaeda flags.
[00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:22.136]  Al-Qaeda is, with the special forces, calling in the airstrikes.
[00:38:22.616 --> 00:38:32.823]  They now admit it's Al-Qaeda, real Al-Qaeda, and now they're sending them into Syria with three proxy armies attacking Assad, who, again, I don't like Mubarak, I don't like Gaddafi, I don't like Assad.
[00:38:33.063 --> 00:38:35.625]  These are guys all that started working with the West.
[00:38:36.462 --> 00:38:37.443]  That's why they got set up.
[00:38:37.483 --> 00:38:38.063]  It shows this.
[00:38:38.423 --> 00:38:45.707]  The globalists want total destabilization and craziness to then have new wars with the Al-Qaeda forces they put in later.
[00:38:46.188 --> 00:38:53.071]  This is full-spectrum dominance, where the globalists launch these wars so they can take the rights of the Arabs and of the American people.
[00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:56.854]  You see, the banks sit above it, playing both sides off against each other.
[00:38:57.654 --> 00:39:04.196]  This is such a classic tactic of divide and conquer, of divide and rule, of balkanization.
[00:39:05.196 --> 00:39:08.037]  And now they are announcing, U.S.
[00:39:08.097 --> 00:39:14.519]  to announce aerial blockade of Syria, Herat, Jerusalem Post, Ynet News, they're all reporting U.S.
[00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:18.620]  readies for possibility of intervention without U.N.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.320]  resolution.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.681]  Oh, last time they got the UN resolution for the peace action, like the UN's the boss.
[00:39:25.302 --> 00:39:27.662]  Of course, that's a puppet the bankers set up to begin with.
[00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:29.843]  And it goes on, citing U.S.
[00:39:29.903 --> 00:39:36.285]  military official, plan to include humanitarian aid to Syria, refugees on Turkish border.
[00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:39.286]  So, so, an invasion is not a war.
[00:39:40.266 --> 00:39:49.014]  Tens of thousands of bombs dropped, blowing up apartment buildings, shooting people, ethnic cleansing of the black Libyans that the media now admits.
[00:39:49.274 --> 00:39:57.521]  We first reported that when Webster Tarpley was willing to actually go over there under bombardment and drive in out of Tunisia.
[00:39:58.142 --> 00:39:59.042]  Under bombardment!
[00:39:59.062 --> 00:40:01.845]  I mean, I had him on the show when air raid sirens were going...
[00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:08.474]  And he's off the air.
[00:40:09.235 --> 00:40:12.520]  And he's there going, they're killing black people everywhere, mowing them down on the streets.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.822]  You know, they're taking over.
[00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:17.627]  Three months later, LA Times, New York Magazine, all of them.
[00:40:17.807 --> 00:40:20.692]  Oh yeah, they line them up and shoot them in the head or hack their heads off with machetes.
[00:40:21.476 --> 00:40:22.437]  They're like, it's liberal.
[00:40:23.277 --> 00:40:29.202]  You know, give your rights up, you know, support world government or you hate black people, but murder them and you're liberal.
[00:40:29.923 --> 00:40:32.525]  And again, love Al Qaeda, murder black people.
[00:40:32.685 --> 00:40:33.265]  It's trendy.
[00:40:33.366 --> 00:40:35.627]  Fight Al Qaeda by putting Al Qaeda in charge.
[00:40:35.988 --> 00:40:41.732]  This is the complete psycho, out of control, crazy garbage that I'm talking about.
[00:40:42.053 --> 00:40:43.334]  I'm not that smart, folks.
[00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:46.036]  This is all common sense in your face.
[00:40:46.396 --> 00:40:51.260]  All you've got to do is start paying attention to how crazy this is, and now they're about
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:51.860]  We're good to go.
[00:41:11.025 --> 00:41:14.607]  And then our news tells us, but Iran works with Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:20.710]  But Al-Qaeda actually works with the criminals that run our government and is attacking Iran and attacking Syria.
[00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.211]  And now they're going to start the love bombs again.
[00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:24.792]  And Congress isn't needed.
[00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:26.452]  The UN isn't needed now.
[00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:29.194]  Now it's just going to be the bankers themselves.
[00:41:29.294 --> 00:41:30.794]  Oh, we can't get a fake UN approval?
[00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:35.957]  We can't get congressional approval because we won't go to them and act like they're actually the boss?
[00:41:35.977 --> 00:41:37.798]  We won't even say where it's coming from!
[00:41:38.298 --> 00:41:39.779]  And we won't even call it a war!
[00:41:40.879 --> 00:41:43.021]  You see, I told you, there's no gun control.
[00:41:43.361 --> 00:41:44.362]  We don't want to take your guns.
[00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:50.927]  And as soon as we said, you do want to take our guns, and got the reports of them saying we're bitter clingers and they're going to get our guns.
[00:41:51.387 --> 00:41:57.372]  As soon as we said, no, you are trying to take them, everybody woke up, now their gun grab is in deep trouble everywhere.
[00:41:57.792 --> 00:41:59.413]  Gun laws are being reversed everywhere.
[00:42:00.114 --> 00:42:02.776]  Okay, real gun control of hitting the target is now coming in.
[00:42:03.356 --> 00:42:04.757]  It's the same thing on world government.
[00:42:04.917 --> 00:42:09.621]  They denied world government existed forever and made fun of us and attacked us and demonized anybody that talked about it.
[00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:10.503]  Doesn't work anymore.
[00:42:10.543 --> 00:42:11.846]  World government's now out in the open.
[00:42:12.287 --> 00:42:18.222]  And this whole Al-Qaeda hoax, when the CIA created it, used it against the Russians, then the Serbs...
[00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:20.749]  On and on and on and on.
[00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:21.249]  Libya.
[00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.611]  Syria.
[00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:23.492]  Iran.
[00:42:23.612 --> 00:42:24.072]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:24.173 --> 00:42:24.613]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:24.693 --> 00:42:25.134]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:25.234 --> 00:42:25.634]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:25.814 --> 00:42:29.558]  And the biggest, goofiest lie in the world is hiding in plain view.
[00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:37.447]  It's hiding completely in plain view in front of all of us that Al-Qaeda is a banker-controlled system.
[00:42:37.687 --> 00:42:38.568]  They want to invade a country?
[00:42:38.788 --> 00:42:40.170]  Call Al-Qaeda freedom fighters.
[00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.911]  Invade the nation.
[00:42:42.622 --> 00:42:43.823]  You want to take America's liberty?
[00:42:43.863 --> 00:42:45.484]  Blow some stuff up, say Al Qaeda's doing it.
[00:42:46.225 --> 00:42:48.687]  Have a few dual agents you set up and kill.
[00:42:49.387 --> 00:42:49.988]  On and on and on.
[00:42:50.008 --> 00:42:50.648]  This is how they do it.
[00:42:50.688 --> 00:42:58.254]  And now they're going to start a new love bomb attack and blockades and other things that are acts of war and tell you it's not war.
[00:42:58.474 --> 00:43:02.197]  And you're supposed to go, oh, Karl Rove says you control reality.
[00:43:02.397 --> 00:43:04.979]  So since you said pigs can fly, they must.
[00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:06.400]  Oh, look at that flying pig, honey.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.061]  No, I'm calling their hoax.
[00:43:08.342 --> 00:43:09.082]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:09.102 --> 00:43:09.603]  Stay with us.
[00:43:12.148 --> 00:43:13.649]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:13.869 --> 00:43:18.910]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.531]  Saving means to make money.
[00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:29.494]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:43:30.234 --> 00:43:37.336]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:43:37.776 --> 00:43:45.379]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:50.680]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.181]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:43:55.942 --> 00:43:58.865]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:44:01.527 --> 00:44:03.649]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:17.805]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:44:18.045 --> 00:44:35.634]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:44:35.894 --> 00:44:41.898]  I've been searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[00:44:42.098 --> 00:44:49.944]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:51.685]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[00:44:53.766 --> 00:44:56.508]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:57.608]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:44:57.848 --> 00:44:58.569]  It's incredible.
[00:44:58.709 --> 00:45:07.754]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:09.755]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:45:10.655 --> 00:45:11.916]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:11.956 --> 00:45:17.319]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:22.182]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:45:22.563 --> 00:45:22.963]  It's true.
[00:45:23.043 --> 00:45:25.624]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:27.606]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:45:28.146 --> 00:45:32.849]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:35.291]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:40.294]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:45:40.474 --> 00:45:41.375]  And here's the best part.
[00:45:41.595 --> 00:45:44.377]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:45:44.657 --> 00:45:47.979]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:51.121]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.363]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:45:53.703 --> 00:45:54.624]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:45:58.266 --> 00:46:00.406]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:46:02.487 --> 00:46:07.008]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:46:07.328 --> 00:46:09.768]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:25.651]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:46:26.673 --> 00:46:30.374]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:43.379]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:51.402]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:46:52.102 --> 00:47:01.689]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:05.732]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:47:06.392 --> 00:47:09.594]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:47:11.976 --> 00:47:18.781]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:25.292]  Big Brother.
[00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:26.833]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:28.374]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:28.614 --> 00:47:29.595]  You want answers?
[00:47:29.895 --> 00:47:30.956]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:31.956 --> 00:47:36.720]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:42.664]  Oh, let's get ready to rumble!
[00:47:59.071 --> 00:48:17.849]  Coming to you live from the High Lie Orlando Center to a capacity crowd of over 1100 people broadcasting worldwide via satellite number one on the internet and transmitting across the globe, it's Alex Jones and the Info Warriors!
[00:48:23.694 --> 00:48:24.215]  Oh dear.
[00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:34.254]  And Marvin the Martian, coming in out of the red corner, a hardcore global communist eugenicist held bent on destroying the planet Earth.
[00:48:35.214 --> 00:48:46.579]  And in the blue corner, weighing over 65 trillion tons, the Colossus of Liberty, the people of planet Earth who will stomp Marvin the Martian into atomic dust!
[00:48:47.519 --> 00:48:48.140]  Oh dear!
[00:48:51.403 --> 00:48:54.645]  I didn't write up any comedy, but I'm just having some fun here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:55.366 --> 00:49:04.193]  You know, it's good for me to get out there, because I'm always there in the command bunker, walking around griping and, you know, firing info weapons at the enemy.
[00:49:04.633 --> 00:49:07.855]  It's good to actually be out here on the front lines with you, and I love you, and it's awesome.
[00:49:07.995 --> 00:49:10.517]  It was fun storming the Texas Capitol, not once, but twice.
[00:49:10.537 --> 00:49:12.779]  It's like, it's impossible.
[00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:16.682]  That must not be real video of hundreds of people storming the Capitol.
[00:49:16.962 --> 00:49:17.963]  They would have arrested him.
[00:49:18.463 --> 00:49:20.305]  After all, he didn't have a permit.
[00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:24.227]  But see, government doesn't know how to deal with that.
[00:49:24.247 --> 00:49:27.887]  It's about this illusion that it's all powerful, and you're scum.
[00:49:28.207 --> 00:49:29.167]  It's not true!
[00:49:29.547 --> 00:49:32.708]  The people have the power!
[00:49:35.048 --> 00:49:37.229]  I'm like a kid with a Mr. Microphone here today.
[00:49:37.249 --> 00:49:40.990]  You know, I actually do this at the office when I'm like voicing ads and stuff.
[00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.390]  Sometimes I'm sitting there kind of like going, this is fun, you know?
[00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.110]  I'm like a little kid again.
[00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:49.011]  Alright, alright, I'm gonna stop it.
[00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:51.776]  Oh, boy.
[00:49:53.717 --> 00:49:57.320]  You gotta try to have a little bit of fun sometimes, though, when they're trying to start World War III.
[00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:08.269]  And when these same interests that want to destroy Iran want to destroy the liberties and freedoms here in America, and they wrap their treason in patriotism, it's just flat wrong.
[00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.793]  Now, I've covered the fact that they're about to launch a new bombing campaign.
[00:50:15.114 --> 00:50:16.556]  It's freedom, though, and it's not violent.
[00:50:17.571 --> 00:50:18.251]  Because they said so.
[00:50:18.491 --> 00:50:24.473]  Remember, Karl Rove told the New York Times, Washington Post, and a whole bunch of other reporters at the cocktail party six years ago.
[00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:27.314]  They were bringing up lies of the administration.
[00:50:27.354 --> 00:50:28.135]  He said, it doesn't matter.
[00:50:28.395 --> 00:50:29.535]  We control reality.
[00:50:30.255 --> 00:50:31.336]  We are history's actors.
[00:50:31.396 --> 00:50:32.476]  We tell you what to say.
[00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.097]  You will then report that new reality.
[00:50:34.937 --> 00:50:37.338]  And they actually said, yeah, you're pretty much God.
[00:50:37.358 --> 00:50:38.058]  And he said, that's right.
[00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:39.318]  That's why I got your job.
[00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:42.139]  Well, see, I don't play like that.
[00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:42.880]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:43.880]  I'm an extremist.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.861]  You know, you lie to me, and
[00:50:48.624 --> 00:50:51.987]  I catch you lying and you say, but it doesn't matter.
[00:50:52.047 --> 00:50:53.969]  I'm going to lie to you because I'm the authority figure.
[00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:57.372]  I say, get out of my way.
[00:50:58.433 --> 00:50:59.233]  It is pathetic.
[00:50:59.253 --> 00:51:06.860]  It is a mind game and we have to stop trusting and supporting and groveling to the system.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.821]  It is so pathetic.
[00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:10.823]  And without further ado, before I get into a global governance.
[00:51:11.798 --> 00:51:14.520]  World Bank wants control of the high seas.
[00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:47.904]  And these same groups then fund organizations to demonize you and say it doesn't exist.
[00:51:48.285 --> 00:51:51.909]  They have pure disdain for you, acting like these documents don't exist.
[00:51:52.249 --> 00:51:55.873]  But then they'll have the controlled right wing go, yeah, that UN tried to take over.
[00:51:55.893 --> 00:51:56.674]  We're going to fight them.
[00:51:57.454 --> 00:51:58.535]  Our government
[00:51:59.156 --> 00:52:02.058]  Run by the Federal Reserve, created the U.N.
[00:52:02.518 --> 00:52:12.544]  It's creating the Law of the Sea Treaty in Agenda 21 to say it's another group and then criminally sign our authority and our law over to it.
[00:52:12.804 --> 00:52:14.245]  Like Obama says, I go to the U.N.
[00:52:14.285 --> 00:52:14.906]  now for war.
[00:52:15.526 --> 00:52:16.607]  Or, I go to the U.N.
[00:52:16.627 --> 00:52:17.367]  for Agenda 21.
[00:52:17.887 --> 00:52:19.228]  Or your city goes to the U.N.
[00:52:19.248 --> 00:52:20.289]  for its zoning rules.
[00:52:20.949 --> 00:52:21.289]  You see?
[00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.311]  And they criminally transfer it over.
[00:52:23.591 --> 00:52:24.812]  But it's still illegitimate.
[00:52:25.593 --> 00:52:30.013]  I mean, it's so obvious that once we see how big the fraud is...
[00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:37.678]  I remember growing up and reading history books, that Hitler quote, about the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.
[00:52:37.938 --> 00:52:42.820]  But he actually went on to explain, talking about communists and how they would do it, but he also did the big lie.
[00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:51.445]  He was saying, yes, the bigger the lie, it's so big that everybody buys into it, and then they don't want to admit they've been conned, and the whole power structure starts defending it.
[00:52:51.966 --> 00:52:56.088]  And that's how these big lies just get pushed and pushed and pushed, whether it's the private-settled...
[00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:59.931]  ...slavery, fluoride in the water, deadly vaccines.
[00:53:00.232 --> 00:53:04.956]  It's such a big lie, and it gets institutionalized, that nobody wants to admit they've been conned.
[00:53:05.336 --> 00:53:16.747]  We have to get to the point of like, look, I may have been conned before, but I'm gonna get informed, I'm gonna get focused, I'm gonna get angry, and I'm gonna stand up against this, because things get too horrible if you don't.
[00:53:18.015 --> 00:53:22.702]  And I'm trying to find the article here out of Canada.
[00:53:22.742 --> 00:53:23.103]  Here it is.
[00:53:23.343 --> 00:53:24.925]  Now talk about groveling.
[00:53:25.246 --> 00:53:26.448]  And I want to try to get this guy on.
[00:53:26.508 --> 00:53:27.449]  I'm sure he's a nice fellow.
[00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.918]  But this is out of the record.
[00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.098]  It's out of Quebec, Canada.
[00:53:32.118 --> 00:53:33.399]  But the same stuff happens here.
[00:53:33.419 --> 00:53:34.319]  You've seen it in the news.
[00:53:34.339 --> 00:53:39.102]  You know, where a 7-year-old arrested, 8-year-old arrested for plastic knife to spread butter.
[00:53:40.402 --> 00:53:48.687]  Or valedictorian loses diploma last day of school because had box of plastic knives and forks in the front of her car.
[00:53:49.187 --> 00:53:49.987]  We've all seen those.
[00:53:50.047 --> 00:53:52.308]  Or child draws stick figure with gun arrested.
[00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:54.129]  Okay?
[00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:58.573]  And you can read this article at the record.
[00:53:58.613 --> 00:53:59.614]  I've shot a video about it.
[00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.017]  It's linked up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:54:03.057 --> 00:54:03.717]  But listen to this.
[00:54:04.258 --> 00:54:08.521]  Man's shocked by arrest after daughter draws picture of gun at school.
[00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:21.752]  A Kitchener father is upset that the police arrested him in his children's school Wednesday, hauled him down to the station, and strip-searched him, all because his four-year-old daughter drew an image of a gun at school.
[00:54:22.748 --> 00:54:26.450]  Now, remember, they go on in this article and say, we'll do it again, this is reasonable.
[00:54:27.371 --> 00:54:28.031]  And what did she say?
[00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:28.871]  They said, why'd you draw a gun?
[00:54:29.512 --> 00:54:31.193]  My daddy kills monsters with it.
[00:54:32.714 --> 00:54:35.095]  And by the way, I checked the laws, that gun's not even illegal there.
[00:54:36.596 --> 00:54:40.018]  But they said he might be planning something with it since she was drawing images.
[00:54:40.298 --> 00:54:42.619]  So they came and arrested him and the CPS took his kids.
[00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:47.722]  Turns out he's a counselor in the community and the school even tried to hire him before to be a counselor there.
[00:54:48.623 --> 00:54:48.863]  Okay?
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.561]  And this goes on here as well.
[00:54:51.581 --> 00:54:53.542]  This is what we don't want to become.
[00:54:53.562 --> 00:54:55.883]  And by the way, the Canadians are mad about this.
[00:54:55.903 --> 00:54:56.564]  They're waking up.
[00:54:57.084 --> 00:54:57.824]  I was in shock.
[00:54:57.884 --> 00:54:59.025]  This is completely insane.
[00:54:59.065 --> 00:55:02.607]  My daughter drew a gun on school, a piece of paper at the school.
[00:55:03.147 --> 00:55:07.210]  Now they have a new article out saying, hysteria caused by plastic gun.
[00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.031]  It was a toy gun at the house that she'd seen.
[00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:21.675]  No, the hysteria was caused by the control freak Nanny State, who doesn't care about the violence on TV, or the arm-to-the-teeth government, but sees the image of a slave even drawing a gun, and they go, AHH!
[00:55:21.936 --> 00:55:22.976]  SLAVE WITH A GUN!
[00:55:22.996 --> 00:55:23.236]  AHH!
[00:55:25.177 --> 00:55:26.397]  That's what they're scared of.
[00:55:26.817 --> 00:55:27.418]  AHH!
[00:55:31.179 --> 00:55:33.180]  I mean, it'd be like in Rome 2,000 years ago.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.420]  You walk out in a slave pen.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.801]  One of them had a sword!
[00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:35.881]  AHH!
[00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:37.973]  It's the same thing.
[00:55:37.993 --> 00:55:45.257]  Or it'd be like in the South or something, 200 years ago, they walked out, you know, they're in the slave quarters and, they've got weapons uprising!
[00:55:46.398 --> 00:55:48.139]  I mean, that's what this is really all about.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.381]  The British government was treating its subjects like slaves.
[00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:54.342]  1776, they came to confiscate the guns.
[00:55:54.582 --> 00:55:57.544]  You can't have slave rabble with weapons!
[00:55:58.024 --> 00:55:59.805]  This is what our country was founded over.
[00:56:00.346 --> 00:56:00.826]  Continuing.
[00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:11.346]  The School Principal Police and Child Welfare Officials, not servants, they're officials, you're an idiot slave citizen that pays their salary.
[00:56:12.047 --> 00:56:17.250]  However, listen, the School Principal Police and Child Welfare Officials, who in the U.S.
[00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.852]  are five times more likely to abuse you than any other group, just ignore it, that's fine, no big deal.
[00:56:21.732 --> 00:56:23.253]  All stand by their actions.
[00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:23.954]  Oh, they're proud of it.
[00:56:24.864 --> 00:56:33.030]  They said they had to investigate, determine whether there was a gun, a gun in his house that children had access to.
[00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:38.374]  Because if they'd seen one... My dad had a newspaper editor he went to college with, I've known for many years.
[00:56:38.454 --> 00:56:38.974]  Nice guy.
[00:56:39.654 --> 00:56:40.555]  Works up in Dallas.
[00:56:40.575 --> 00:56:42.557]  If I said his name, anybody in Dallas would know who he is.
[00:56:43.717 --> 00:56:44.858]  And this is back when I was in college.
[00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:59.685]  They had a gun safe, and I was going deer hunting and shooting, and my guns were at my parents' house, and I just came walking through the house out, and they were in the dining room, and he barely saw it, and I heard, and I was like, and
[00:57:00.445 --> 00:57:03.448]  And he's like, and my dad's like, it's okay, it's okay.
[00:57:03.688 --> 00:57:10.373]  It's like a Monty Python skit, where like the fish called Wanda, where the guy eats the fish, the guy stutters.
[00:57:10.934 --> 00:57:13.556]  And I walked in and I said, look, I'm going to the shooting range, it's unloaded.
[00:57:13.816 --> 00:57:18.039]  And he's like, and I was like, no, listen, it's.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:19.901]  It's not that big of a deal.
[00:57:19.921 --> 00:57:21.201]  You want to hold it, get over your fear?
[00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:22.842]  Look, it's unloaded.
[00:57:23.142 --> 00:57:27.364]  And I learned he pretty much freaked out and had to leave.
[00:57:28.225 --> 00:57:32.767]  But he sees a cop with a gun, he's like, the government with a gun, properly trained.
[00:57:33.387 --> 00:57:36.869]  So anyways, the whole article just goes on and on.
[00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:38.610]  And I think about these domesticated people.
[00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.511]  They love to send their wives and daughters out without guns.
[00:57:41.811 --> 00:57:42.992]  Rape, killed, they love it.
[00:57:43.012 --> 00:57:44.653]  It's like a sacrament of idiocy.
[00:57:45.493 --> 00:57:50.280]  We'll tell you more about this coming up and a ton of other news and your calls and guests in here.
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.183]  We'll be right back from Orlando!
[00:57:52.203 --> 00:57:52.283]  Yeah!
[00:57:52.683 --> 00:57:54.486]  Yeah!

[00:57:55.788 --> 00:57:58.011]  Yeah!
[00:57:58.892 --> 00:57:59.854]  We're alive!
[00:58:01.584 --> 00:58:06.271]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:58:06.571 --> 00:58:17.787]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge
[00:58:17.987 --> 00:58:18.368]  I think so.

[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.361]  I had tried everything.
[00:59:02.421 --> 00:59:07.483]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:59:07.903 --> 00:59:12.385]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:59:12.745 --> 00:59:19.108]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:59:19.608 --> 00:59:30.071]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:30.811 --> 00:59:34.952]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:59:35.292 --> 00:59:38.293]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:59:38.633 --> 00:59:41.294]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:41.534 --> 00:59:42.695]  Now that's results.
[00:59:43.115 --> 00:59:49.538]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:59:49.898 --> 00:59:55.220]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:59:58.181 --> 00:59:59.222]  Infowarsteam.com
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.721]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:00:05.461 --> 01:00:09.542]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:12.463 --> 01:00:18.485]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.105 --> 01:00:22.086]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.396 --> 01:00:34.158]  See, having all these people staring at me here, it kind of makes me want to blush, so I feel like I have to self-deprecate with some joking around a little bit here.
[01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:39.120]  After this break, I am going to start getting some people in here to talk with us.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.621]  In fact, why don't you come in next segment, Doc Holliday, and talk about the royalty
[01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:49.764]  The royalty that's here in town, and shutting down all the highways for the NDA!
[01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:55.086]  I mean, it's like a wide-open highway, and there's all these cops acting like God has arrived.
[01:00:55.847 --> 01:00:59.928]  Again, you have to protect them from the rabble, but the rabble who paid for it.
[01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:06.572]  So, coming up in about five minutes, we're going to cover it, so just be on standby there in your public green room.
[01:01:07.517 --> 01:01:10.218]  It's almost like when the politicians have their families standing behind them.
[01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:11.838]  I have a little radio station behind me.
[01:01:12.818 --> 01:01:15.979]  Getting back to this article that reads like satire, but it's not.
[01:01:16.019 --> 01:01:19.180]  It's ninnying about, oh, they stand by it.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:27.822]  Strip-searching and government taking his children because the daughter drew a gun and said that daddy kills monsters and we had to make sure there was a gun.
[01:01:27.842 --> 01:01:27.902]  Why?
[01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:29.683]  Did they have access?
[01:01:30.723 --> 01:01:32.223]  They went to his house without a warrant.
[01:01:32.644 --> 01:01:33.604]  Don't need those anymore.
[01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:41.499]  From a public safety point of view, any child drawing a picture of a gun... From now on, just say guns.
[01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:42.500]  Guns!
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.441]  I'm sorry, I've overdone that.
[01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:45.862]  It's fun to do, though.
[01:01:46.182 --> 01:01:55.910]  And saying there's guns in the home would warrant some further conversation with the parents and child, said Allison Scott, Executive Director of Family and Children's Services.
[01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:58.592]  Yes, it would warrant a talk.
[01:01:59.409 --> 01:02:04.295]  Grabbing you at the school in front of everyone, keeping you for the day, strip searching you, taking your children.
[01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:06.799]  That's what we call talking to you.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.063]  Where the God's reasonable.
[01:02:10.203 --> 01:02:15.931]  Our handbooks and training for CPS say we're going to break up the family and it's a disease and we're a eugenics cult.
[01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:21.155]  Shut up in 1915 in North America, across the continent, to break up the family.
[01:02:21.175 --> 01:02:23.397]  But it's just, we're gonna talk to you.
[01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:24.658]  It's no big deal.
[01:02:24.698 --> 01:02:26.359]  We're just here to train your kids for prison.
[01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:29.361]  We have the biggest prison population in North America as well.
[01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:43.692]  Continuing, Waterloo Regional Police INSEP, Kevin Thaller, said there was a complaint from Forest Hills Public School that a firearm was in a residence and children had access to it.
[01:02:43.752 --> 01:02:45.274]  See, the gun's not illegal.
[01:02:45.814 --> 01:02:47.756]  But they said the children had access.
[01:02:47.816 --> 01:02:51.279]  A child draws a gun that they can see on TV anywhere.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.945]  You're guilty without a court, and you don't have a warrant, and you get strip searched and your kids get taken.
[01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:03.530]  I mean, how many of us drew images of guns as children in school?
[01:03:03.911 --> 01:03:04.631]  I know I did.
[01:03:06.213 --> 01:03:06.854]  How many people?
[01:03:08.995 --> 01:03:10.617]  I'm seeing a lot of hands raised here.
[01:03:10.737 --> 01:03:11.077]  A lot.
[01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:13.745]  But after I look at the lights, I can't see anymore.
[01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:15.953]  Big, big spots there.
[01:03:16.776 --> 01:03:17.499]  Trying to read here.
[01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:20.218]  So there you have it.
[01:03:20.598 --> 01:03:37.250]  Waterloo Regional Police Inspector, I guess NSP is Inspector, Inspector, I'm inspecting the enemy of the Canadian people, said there was a complaint from Forest Hill Public Schools, government training camp, that a firearm was in a residence and children had access to it.
[01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:43.115]  We had every concern based on this information that the children were in danger.
[01:03:43.535 --> 01:03:46.317]  Their concern wasn't based on the drawing alone.
[01:03:46.897 --> 01:03:47.818]  No, it gets worse.
[01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:55.949]  The child who made the drawing also made comments about it that raised more flags.
[01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.592]  Wait, daddy shoots monsters.
[01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:02.495]  He said he went to the school Wednesday afternoon to pick up the three children.
[01:04:03.336 --> 01:04:07.299]  But see, they don't tell you what the flag was because they want to just let it linger like it was really bad.
[01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:08.641]  They don't tell you until later.
[01:04:09.565 --> 01:04:11.247]  It's all written for propaganda purposes.
[01:04:12.127 --> 01:04:13.028]  Notice how they operate.
[01:04:13.088 --> 01:04:14.390]  This is a propagandist writing this.
[01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:18.193]  He said he went to the school Wednesday afternoon to pick up the three children.
[01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:27.983]  He was summoned by the government training camp, I mean, to the principal's office, where three police officers, you mean globalist enforcement, family destructive, new world order servant minions were.
[01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:29.084]  Let me go back to that.
[01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:30.226]  I was translating it.
[01:04:30.626 --> 01:04:32.709]  He said he went to the government training camp.
[01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:33.069]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:36.874]  He said he went to the school Wednesday afternoon to pick up his three children.
[01:04:37.595 --> 01:04:40.800]  He was summoned to the principal's office where three police officers were waiting.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.705]  They said he was being charged with possession of a firearm.
[01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:48.407]  He was escorted from the school and put in the back of the cruiser.
[01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:49.907]  Then he goes on his trip search.
[01:04:50.648 --> 01:04:51.888]  And what was the next flag?
[01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:56.350]  That they asked the young girl and she said, Daddy shoots monsters with it.
[01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:57.810]  Don't worry about monsters.
[01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:58.830]  I have the toy gun.
[01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.091]  Oh, good, Daddy.
[01:05:00.111 --> 01:05:04.452]  Folks, I play gun with my kids all the time.
[01:05:04.472 --> 01:05:05.513]  You know, running around, playing.
[01:05:06.513 --> 01:05:07.233]  I guess I'm evil.
[01:05:07.313 --> 01:05:09.394]  I mean, I need to have them taken, I guess, with a loving state.
[01:05:10.512 --> 01:05:15.756]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:21.780]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:28.925]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:30.866 --> 01:05:33.168]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:37.211]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:39.346 --> 01:05:43.207]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[01:06:07.533 --> 01:06:08.333]  Others don't.
[01:06:11.124 --> 01:06:16.185]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:25.468]  Alright, finishing up, we are here in Orlando visiting my local affiliate, A-10.
[01:06:25.488 --> 01:06:27.228]  Yeah!
[01:06:29.749 --> 01:06:31.229]  Let them hear your war growl!
[01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:38.211]  Yeah!
[01:06:40.452 --> 01:06:40.972]  Yeah!
[01:06:44.873 --> 01:06:47.615]  Rob Zombie, step aside, I want your job, boy!
[01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:52.858]  Yeah!
[01:06:55.899 --> 01:06:57.100]  Freedom!
[01:07:01.906 --> 01:07:04.307]  The global is literally pooping their pants when I hear that.
[01:07:04.327 --> 01:07:07.369]  They're like, get more Prozac, more red red in them!
[01:07:07.749 --> 01:07:09.110]  GMO immediately!
[01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:11.672]  It's only killing the rodents in three generations!
[01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:15.053]  I want them diseased and damaged now!
[01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:16.834]  They're rising up quickly!
[01:07:17.735 --> 01:07:18.936]  More American Idol!
[01:07:18.976 --> 01:07:19.956]  More brainwashing!
[01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:21.397]  Demonize their families!
[01:07:21.757 --> 01:07:22.358]  Now!
[01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:25.259]  Get out there!
[01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:27.841]  They're not watching our anchors anymore!
[01:07:28.101 --> 01:07:29.922]  Begin shutting down the internet!
[01:07:32.574 --> 01:07:32.914]  Excuse me.
[01:07:33.914 --> 01:07:35.695]  Getting back to the rabble.
[01:07:36.735 --> 01:07:40.096]  I'm down here with the commoners in Orlando, Florida.
[01:07:40.396 --> 01:07:40.876]  Rabble.
[01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:41.837]  Excuse me.
[01:07:43.237 --> 01:07:43.697]  Okay.
[01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.578]  Doc Holliday's here with us.
[01:07:46.798 --> 01:07:47.758]  Good to be with you, sir.
[01:07:47.778 --> 01:07:48.779]  It's good to be with you.
[01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.039]  I mean, you are the man.
[01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:51.420]  Please don't.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.400]  Please.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.480]  Well, I didn't mean that.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.260]  No, I'm not.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:54.840]  You are the man.
[01:07:54.901 --> 01:07:55.861]  Now, let's stop right there.
[01:07:57.032 --> 01:08:07.536]  Uh, you were on my show a couple days ago and you were telling me about how, just in the lead up to the All-Star Game and Lord Obama landing when he's not shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment or narcotics back to the United States or bombing countries without comparison or approval.
[01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:13.478]  You were telling me that our Lordship, who goes to the UN to launch wars, because he says it's for their credibility.
[01:08:13.638 --> 01:08:13.798]  Right.
[01:08:13.838 --> 01:08:18.099]  Mr. Treason, who sat at the head of the UN Security Council, violating Article 1, Section 9.
[01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:19.560]  I don't just use treason lightly.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.121]  He, I mean, you told me they shut down highways, roads, motorcades, part of downtown.
[01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:25.462]  Total lavishment.
[01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:28.684]  Taxpayer funded, shutting down local businesses.
[01:08:28.744 --> 01:08:29.584]  God has arrived.
[01:08:31.606 --> 01:08:33.647]  And I've actually seen this while I'm here.
[01:08:33.687 --> 01:08:40.171]  I shot a YouTube driving in of just, you know, the tour buses with police escorts and just everything lavishment.
[01:08:40.852 --> 01:08:42.593]  Tell us, tell us what's going on here.
[01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:48.635]  Well, you know, it was funny because I would tell Alex, I'd say, look, you don't even realize how strange it's become.
[01:08:49.016 --> 01:08:52.037]  It became a racially divisive issue.
[01:08:52.237 --> 01:09:01.701]  Oh yeah, because he's running ads saying, acquitting himself of Martin Luther King when he signed the NDAA to abolish the Bill of Rights, and saying African Americans for Obama, yeah.
[01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:02.241]  Right.
[01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:04.542]  And those are running here, and he's in the Oval Office.
[01:09:04.602 --> 01:09:07.623]  It's a campaign ad saying churches vote for me, too.
[01:09:07.883 --> 01:09:09.664]  Right, and so... I'm going to interrupt you some more.
[01:09:09.924 --> 01:09:10.265]  No, no, no.
[01:09:10.325 --> 01:09:10.685]  It's okay.
[01:09:10.705 --> 01:09:11.286]  You can interrupt me.
[01:09:11.326 --> 01:09:12.147]  I'm gonna do it again.
[01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:13.148]  I'm used to it all the time.
[01:09:13.348 --> 01:09:14.469]  My listeners are gonna get more of it.
[01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:14.950]  I'm sorry.
[01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:15.450]  It's okay.
[01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.611]  Tell him to interrupt me.
[01:09:16.651 --> 01:09:17.192]  It's alright.
[01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:17.853]  It's a joke.
[01:09:17.913 --> 01:09:18.954]  Go ahead.
[01:09:19.595 --> 01:09:19.895]  No, no.
[01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:21.717]  What I said was, I said, you'd be surprised.
[01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:28.645]  You're coming here to Orlando, and I know the NBA All-Star Game is here, but Obama came in and he flew in with an agenda.
[01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:29.305]  No.
[01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:32.727]  He's thinking for himself, no government has an agenda.
[01:09:32.747 --> 01:09:33.887]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:09:33.947 --> 01:09:35.688]  No, they're trying to create division.
[01:09:52.276 --> 01:09:57.462]  They created the vision in the media, and then everyone said, yeah, NBA All-Star Weekend is us.
[01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:58.623]  Obama's here.
[01:09:58.643 --> 01:10:01.266]  I don't know who he's going to relate to, to be totally honest.
[01:10:01.306 --> 01:10:04.709]  My point is, that's great for him to be reaching out to whatever ethic group.
[01:10:04.749 --> 01:10:05.330]  That's fine.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.633]  My issue is that it's like, I'm going to give you a free house.
[01:10:08.914 --> 01:10:10.075]  He lied to everybody.
[01:10:10.155 --> 01:10:10.836]  He's a puppet.
[01:10:11.136 --> 01:10:12.497]  There's a woman in Tampa right now.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.806]  Who still is waiting for her free house and her mortgage to be paid in 2008.
[01:10:19.866 --> 01:10:23.751]  She said, can I have a, can I get my house paid for because I'm about to get thrown out?
[01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:25.693]  And he's like, yeah, I'll take care of it.
[01:10:25.933 --> 01:10:27.175]  Who would say over and over again?
[01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:28.477]  Oh, thank you, Mr. President.
[01:10:28.497 --> 01:10:29.878]  Remember that guy, that was in Florida.
[01:10:29.898 --> 01:10:33.523]  He goes, I want to, I want to, my car paid for Obama goes, you'll get it.
[01:10:34.003 --> 01:10:34.443]  You'll get it!
[01:10:35.004 --> 01:10:41.926]  And that poor woman was like, oh lordy, lordy, he's paying my mortgage and I want somebody to go down and tell her he's lying!
[01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:46.188]  By the way, they do have those mortgage renegotiation deals, but it doesn't even really help you.
[01:10:46.228 --> 01:10:49.950]  I've looked at them and had experts on, and when you sign that agreement, you waive all your rights.
[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:52.651]  Well, they closed down the roads here in Orlando.
[01:10:52.991 --> 01:10:55.952]  They built lanes for Obama's VIP.
[01:10:56.352 --> 01:11:00.694]  Obama came in to go- Now, the traffic is horrible and people tell me it's not normally like that.
[01:11:00.914 --> 01:11:03.735]  Oh no, it's not that bad, and you saw what I was telling you.
[01:11:04.456 --> 01:11:07.657]  Well, first I run into this giant traffic jam, and they've got cops.
[01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:09.618]  I didn't get that part because I pulled my iPhone out after.
[01:11:10.119 --> 01:11:14.341]  They had cops all over the side of the highways, partially blocking, so we're almost late getting here.
[01:11:14.381 --> 01:11:16.922]  You know, we only got here like 45 minutes before, instead of like an hour and a half.
[01:11:17.102 --> 01:11:17.242]  Right.
[01:11:17.262 --> 01:11:18.063]  For all the stuff we had to do.
[01:11:18.303 --> 01:11:19.324]  And I'm like, what is this?
[01:11:20.366 --> 01:11:23.849]  And it's just that the highway's shut down and then it's these cops and then it's these royal buses.
[01:11:24.009 --> 01:11:26.712]  They were like blocking the road for them to enter the royal road.
[01:11:26.893 --> 01:11:31.137]  You can't drive anywhere around here because the elitists are here.
[01:11:31.177 --> 01:11:31.958]  Now that's okay.
[01:11:32.478 --> 01:11:33.540]  It's an all-star game.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:34.601]  Whatever.
[01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:52.010]  But it became a racial issue because in the Daytona 500, which is being run right now, over in, you know, in Daytona, obviously, and then you have the NBA All-Star Game, and Obama came in and favored the All-Star Game, would not go to the Daytona 500, and made it a huge issue.
[01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:54.051]  And then they started running the ad that we sent you.
[01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:59.193]  They ran the ad when they brought up slavery, they brought up all kind of stuff.
[01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:00.434]  The point is, the point is,
[01:12:01.054 --> 01:12:05.497]  My big issue is, remember Bush started getting booed at baseball games and stuff, it's very hiding.
[01:12:05.877 --> 01:12:13.721]  So Obama, I don't blame him not going to the NASCAR deal, just because that, you know, crowd, I mean, good folks, bad folks, like any other crowd, who knows what they do.
[01:12:14.022 --> 01:12:17.424]  So I understand now that Obama's so unpopular, kind of like Bush has got to hide out.
[01:12:17.744 --> 01:12:22.967]  But when you sent me the video, what I went crazy on, and I meant to play it today, I played it a few days ago, as everybody knows.
[01:12:23.767 --> 01:12:26.589]  I think the title of it has got like a million and a half views on YouTube.
[01:12:26.869 --> 01:12:27.830]  It's airing on TV here.
[01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:32.753]  It's something like, Obama announces African Americans for Obama 2012.
[01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:34.354]  African Americans for Obama.
[01:12:34.474 --> 01:12:35.375]  But listen, in it, in it.
[01:12:35.415 --> 01:12:38.677]  Not Latinos, not whites, not anybody, only African Americans.
[01:12:39.978 --> 01:12:44.802]  But my issue is he says, in the churches set up vote teams, your churches must vote for me.
[01:12:45.142 --> 01:13:03.658]  Now wait a minute, they tell people don't have political stuff in your church or organize it as a political group, which you actually have the rights to in the First Amendment, but they lie and tell conservative or libertarian churches you can't do that, but here's Obama saying use the churches to get people elected and no media coverage of this saying get your church to get out the ballot for me.
[01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:10.563]  That video was run on the big scoreboard inside the Amway Arena during an NBA game.
[01:13:10.943 --> 01:13:12.805]  And how is that supposed to make people feel?
[01:13:13.205 --> 01:13:19.390]  How does that make the white guy feel versus whatever that he is trying to appeal to?
[01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:20.591]  I mean, let's face it.
[01:13:20.991 --> 01:13:22.332]  I'm blacker than Obama.
[01:13:23.093 --> 01:13:24.554]  You're blacker than Obama.
[01:13:25.094 --> 01:13:25.594]  And you know what?
[01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:28.155]  Don't play the race card unless you can back it up.
[01:13:28.535 --> 01:13:34.336]  So he played the race card, and I thought to myself, and that's why we sent it to you, it's running all over TV.
[01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:46.900]  So he happens to, you know, land, and he wants to do the NBA thing, and he wants to hang out with people that he has no idea what their names are, and all he did was cause divisiveness because the media... Well, here's my issue.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.740]  Taxpayers...
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.364]  I'm sick of paying for Formula One tracks and billion-dollar sports stadiums.
[01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:58.013]  And I'm sick of Bush, Obama, anybody with like 50, 60, you know, cavalcade deals shutting down roads.
[01:13:58.074 --> 01:13:59.175]  I'm tired of it, period.
[01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:02.359]  I mean, you know, they need to act like public servants and not God.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.361]  That's what I'm tired of.
[01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:04.241]  But you know what?
[01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:11.164]  What it was is that they deliberately shut down part of Interstate 4 only for Obama's VIPs.
[01:14:11.484 --> 01:14:13.324]  And it caused a lot of problems.
[01:14:13.344 --> 01:14:17.546]  Yeah, so now it's not just the President that shuts down highways, it's the VIPs.
[01:14:17.906 --> 01:14:18.726]  Well, it's the rapper.
[01:14:19.186 --> 01:14:32.290]  It's these guys that get arrested, they got the gold teeth, they've got all kinds of problems, you got all kinds of people here with drug raps, and we're supposed to be emulating these people, and we think, honestly, that people are looking at it the wrong way.
[01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:47.615]  By the way, they put a big wall up around the Amway Arena so the local businesses could not do a lick of business because the VIPs didn't want to be bothered with dealing with local people.
[01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:49.956]  So why is the NBA All-Star Game here?
[01:14:50.076 --> 01:14:50.417]  Listen.
[01:14:50.537 --> 01:14:51.577]  Why is it here?
[01:14:51.597 --> 01:14:53.018]  This shows the elitism.
[01:14:53.319 --> 01:14:55.840]  And they get the mayors, everybody, like Formula 1 in Austin.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.501]  Taxpayers pay for it.
[01:14:58.602 --> 01:15:02.024]  And then we're all going to be basically blocked off from it.
[01:15:02.304 --> 01:15:03.545]  And it's going to screw up the city.
[01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.547]  But because the mayor gets invited.
[01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:10.630]  What I love is because this political system, a lot of times people sell out not even for money.
[01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:13.011]  They sell out just to be invited to the party.
[01:15:13.452 --> 01:15:15.393]  You couldn't pay me to go to a Formula 1.
[01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:16.594]  If you like it, fine.
[01:15:16.914 --> 01:15:18.916]  You couldn't pay me to go to an NBA game.
[01:15:18.936 --> 01:15:20.018]  And I like basketball.
[01:15:20.038 --> 01:15:23.682]  It's just going there and the checkpoints and the people and all of it.
[01:15:23.742 --> 01:15:25.403]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:15:25.704 --> 01:15:27.045]  And it's the way they build it up.
[01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:29.027]  Like, it's the end all, be all.
[01:15:29.428 --> 01:15:31.750]  Meanwhile, you're a weirdo if you care about freedom.
[01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:33.973]  You know, I told folks about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:35.855]  Sometimes they're like, man, that's kind of weird.
[01:15:36.336 --> 01:15:38.418]  I'm like, well, that's what makes America, America.
[01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:47.500]  But we paid $400 million for an arena because they said they were going to have an all-star game here, that the city finally was going to be able to do that.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.101]  And now they use it to shut down Doc Holliday, big A-10 here in Orlando.
[01:15:51.342 --> 01:15:52.182]  You're awesome, folks!
[01:15:52.202 --> 01:15:53.122]  We're going out to break!
[01:15:53.142 --> 01:15:53.262]  Yeah!
[01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:56.063]  We're going to be right back.
[01:15:56.143 --> 01:15:57.803]  Stay with us for more news.
[01:15:58.203 --> 01:16:01.304]  I'm going to get into the UN takeover of the oceans straight ahead.
[01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:02.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:03.005 --> 01:16:03.525]  Stay with us.
[01:16:12.066 --> 01:16:13.567]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:13.788 --> 01:16:18.811]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:16:19.092 --> 01:16:20.453]  Saving means to make money.
[01:16:20.613 --> 01:16:29.420]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:37.244]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:16:37.664 --> 01:16:45.288]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:53.073]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:17.704]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:17:17.944 --> 01:17:35.574]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:17:35.835 --> 01:17:39.937]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:49.844]  The longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:56.388]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:14.593]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:14.913 --> 01:19:15.514]  Number one.
[01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.976]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:19:19.257 --> 01:19:19.817]  Number two.
[01:19:20.117 --> 01:19:24.661]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:25.441]  It's true.
[01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:30.305]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:31.165]  Number three.
[01:19:31.446 --> 01:19:34.728]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:19:35.028 --> 01:19:38.711]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:39.472]  Number 4.
[01:19:39.732 --> 01:19:42.094]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:19:42.494 --> 01:19:45.858]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:19:46.178 --> 01:19:46.378]  Number 5.
[01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:50.882]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:19:51.102 --> 01:19:55.867]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:19:56.147 --> 01:20:00.188]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:20:00.308 --> 01:20:01.888]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:20:02.109 --> 01:20:04.189]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:20:04.349 --> 01:20:06.950]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:13.031]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:13.391 --> 01:20:14.812]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:15.452 --> 01:20:18.653]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:28.442 --> 01:20:30.943]  We were discussing the national security state.
[01:20:30.983 --> 01:20:37.905]  By the way, we're back live, Big 810 Events, speaking to a capacity crowd, here at the Orlando High Life Center.
[01:20:39.426 --> 01:20:41.707]  What is the Big810am.com?
[01:20:42.287 --> 01:20:43.287]  I forget the URL.
[01:20:43.307 --> 01:20:45.188]  What's the great radio station's URL?
[01:20:46.548 --> 01:20:49.069]  Big810am.com, baby.
[01:20:49.389 --> 01:20:50.590]  You folks are awesome!
[01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:53.271]  Yeah!
[01:20:55.632 --> 01:20:58.874]  I'm going to be giving a speech and premiering a 40-minute documentary coming up here.
[01:20:59.434 --> 01:21:01.735]  And they said, hey, why don't you do your show from their lives.
[01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:03.136]  So we are doing it here.
[01:21:04.117 --> 01:21:06.778]  And, I don't know, the weekend Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:21:06.798 --> 01:21:09.500]  Central, it has about 67 stations or so picking it up.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.962]  Weekday show, a little over 100 now, and we're on XM for over two years now.
[01:21:13.982 --> 01:21:18.225]  And we're reaching, we have the internet and everything else together and the podcast and the YouTubes.
[01:21:18.325 --> 01:21:19.766]  Every week, 15 million people.
[01:21:20.686 --> 01:21:26.652]  Again, a testament to the underdog when you've got the truth, when you've got the information, and when you're willing to resist tyranny.
[01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:31.457]  Now, we've been talking about solutions and victories we've had in my speech coming up tonight.
[01:21:31.477 --> 01:21:40.366]  Before I get into a big globalist power grab that ties into Agenda 21, it's starting to get a lot of attention because cities all over the country are fighting against UN takeover.
[01:21:40.807 --> 01:21:42.108]  Schwarzenegger, whenever he
[01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:51.693]  Was at the Copenhagen event two years ago or so, and they were calling for global governance and global taxes out there with Al Gore and this global treaty.
[01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:59.896]  When it failed to get the countries to sign on and waive their sovereignty, failed... Yeah, see, we moved this mic and that's what's doing that.
[01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:11.894]  Um, as I was saying, whenever that started, Schwarzenegger, and he looked us up in USA Today, he said, what we're going to do now is we're going to go to the counties, cities, and states.
[01:22:12.634 --> 01:22:13.995]  And that is the Agenda 21.
[01:22:14.715 --> 01:22:19.677]  And we will implement the carbon tax and the sustainable development through your local community.
[01:22:19.997 --> 01:22:23.661]  In other words, we'll engage in treason and try to take over your sovereignty from within.
[01:22:24.121 --> 01:22:26.624]  You should have his big, fat, steroid head locked up.
[01:22:27.165 --> 01:22:32.931]  Now, just like Obama should be locked up for saying the UN gives him the authority to blow up countries, and not Congress.
[01:22:33.592 --> 01:22:35.694]  This is the incredible stuff, so I'm gonna get into some of that agenda 21.
[01:22:35.734 --> 01:22:36.134]  But I wanted...
[01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:39.518]  To talk to Matt from Tampa.
[01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.901]  He came down here with some folks from We Are Change Tampa.
[01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:44.582]  And they're in Pinellas County.
[01:22:44.883 --> 01:22:45.323]  Yeah!
[01:22:45.844 --> 01:22:47.045]  That's about a million people.
[01:22:47.105 --> 01:22:48.026]  Right at a million people.
[01:22:48.386 --> 01:22:53.230]  You heard last year they pulled the so-called fluoride, it's really even more deadly than that, out of the water.
[01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:56.673]  And they did it with the scientific facts that are out there.
[01:22:56.713 --> 01:23:03.339]  Seven-fold increase in cancer, hundreds of chemicals in the so-called fluoride, toxic waste, by-product, Grignard reagents.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.021]  And they got it removed.
[01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:09.965]  And it's happening all over the world when you come forward with the information and keep doing it year after year.
[01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:14.669]  So tell folks what it is, why you got involved, and what you and your group did.
[01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:16.227]  Go ahead.
[01:23:16.567 --> 01:23:24.371]  Well, basically we have to thank our Pinellas County Commissioner Norm Roach and he was the one that actually got the ball rolling for us.
[01:23:26.052 --> 01:23:28.113]  He was wanting to do it as a budget cut.
[01:23:28.793 --> 01:23:30.594]  He was wanting to do it as a budget cut.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.981]  I don't know if they can hear me.
[01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:34.142]  Yeah, they can hear you.
[01:23:34.302 --> 01:23:37.884]  I mean, the bigger issue here is, I understand your county commissioner's a great guy.
[01:23:38.144 --> 01:23:38.945]  Tell us about fluoride.
[01:23:38.985 --> 01:23:41.627]  Alright, well, the problem was they don't even use fluoride.
[01:23:41.647 --> 01:23:44.249]  They use what's called hydrofluosilicic acid.
[01:23:44.789 --> 01:23:56.297]  And thanks to Fluoride Free Austin, we got a document from Mosaic that showed that hydrofluosilicic acid was a poison, and it said right on the poison label that we had in hand, not to ingest.
[01:23:56.718 --> 01:24:00.000]  So we asked them why it is that the poison label says not to ingest it.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.363]  Your water has a label saying if you breathe any of this, you're dead.
[01:24:03.503 --> 01:24:06.126]  Yeah, with skull and crossbones, it says right on the label.
[01:24:06.146 --> 01:24:08.588]  But it's your baby, fluoride baby water.
[01:24:08.809 --> 01:24:09.970]  Tell folks what it really is.
[01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:15.015]  Well, it's a waste byproduct.
[01:24:15.075 --> 01:24:16.596]  It's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:24:16.856 --> 01:24:18.338]  And that's what they actually put into the water.
[01:24:18.378 --> 01:24:20.280]  The propaganda is the fluoride.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.161]  But what they're actually putting in it is, you know, waste by-product and stuff.
[01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:30.842]  So they came in there with dentists and ADA people and they said, you know, it's for the children, it's for the children.
[01:24:31.342 --> 01:24:39.043]  But we showed them the facts and showed them that, you know, the facts are... By the way, you know the chemical industry on average gives the American Dental Association about 20 million a year.
[01:24:39.343 --> 01:24:39.523]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:39.623 --> 01:24:40.083]  You know why?
[01:24:40.243 --> 01:24:42.864]  Because then cities like Austin pay about a million a year for it.
[01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.184]  Imagine how much they're making.
[01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:47.105]  They're making billions off selling you toxic waste.
[01:24:47.285 --> 01:24:48.405]  They'd have to pay to store.
[01:24:49.005 --> 01:24:53.167]  No, they use us as human filters, basically, because they can't dump it into the ocean.
[01:24:53.187 --> 01:24:55.949]  So the only way they can get rid of it is to use us as human filters.
[01:24:55.969 --> 01:24:56.889]  They dump it in your bones!
[01:24:57.029 --> 01:24:57.570]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:58.110]  Love it!
[01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:01.912]  But we did it with budget cuts.
[01:25:02.332 --> 01:25:08.655]  We said, why pay for this poison when our budgets are upside down and they're all, you know, in massive debt?
[01:25:08.695 --> 01:25:10.756]  So we got it cut out that way.
[01:25:10.836 --> 01:25:12.938]  So that's a way for other people to also do it.
[01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:15.239]  Bring it to your... Bring it...
[01:25:18.903 --> 01:25:25.466]  Go to your county commissioners and ask them why you're spending $200,000 of your tax dollars on poison to put in the water.
[01:25:25.726 --> 01:25:29.528]  And again, when that hoax falls, when all the hoaxes fall, they're going down.
[01:25:29.568 --> 01:25:32.549]  This shows we're on the march and you know it's happening all over the world now.
[01:25:32.729 --> 01:25:33.309]  Right, right.
[01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:36.271]  Well, I'm glad and I feel healthier already.
[01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:37.611]  They took it out on the first.
[01:25:39.392 --> 01:25:40.474]  You're incredible.
[01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:42.676]  But again, it's an example of taking action.
[01:25:42.857 --> 01:25:44.178]  Now tell us about your buddy over here.
[01:25:44.198 --> 01:25:45.280]  We're going to bring him in here.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.543]  He says he's got some stuff he wants to say.
[01:25:47.603 --> 01:25:48.143]  Come on over here.
[01:25:48.163 --> 01:25:48.624]  What's his name?
[01:25:49.025 --> 01:25:50.426]  Chris.
[01:25:50.466 --> 01:25:55.493]  We work together on getting the information to the commission and stuff, so I'll let him... Alright, Chris.
[01:25:55.533 --> 01:25:56.014]  Jump in here.
[01:25:56.906 --> 01:25:57.466]  Come on in here.
[01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:02.310]  We've only got a few minutes, but tell folks your whole view on fluoride and the tide getting turned here.
[01:26:03.151 --> 01:26:04.372]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:07.174]  Well, thank you for your help in getting this victory.
[01:26:07.875 --> 01:26:09.055]  You don't need to thank me, brother.
[01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:10.637]  I don't want my kids getting poisoned.
[01:26:11.257 --> 01:26:12.338]  I want to defeat the enemy.
[01:26:12.698 --> 01:26:13.199]  Crush them!
[01:26:14.199 --> 01:26:14.680]  And we shall.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.221]  They're a bunch of murdering scum!
[01:26:16.441 --> 01:26:17.502]  They're poisoning you!
[01:26:17.682 --> 01:26:18.503]  They're the enemy!
[01:26:18.743 --> 01:26:19.784]  See who they are!
[01:26:20.344 --> 01:26:21.165]  God Almighty!
[01:26:22.902 --> 01:26:24.983]  And we're learning, we're seeing what's going on.
[01:26:25.003 --> 01:26:28.565]  I mean, we have a commissioner, Susan Latvala, who fought us since 2009.
[01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:36.589]  And I need to also thank a friend of mine who couldn't be here today, named Frank Hopson, who's been attending these county commission meetings.
[01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:45.034]  And this commissioner told both he and I in a private meeting that what Big Phosphate wants, Big Phosphate gets.
[01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:49.896]  When I confronted her about this, she tried to sidestep it and tap dance and save it.
[01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:51.537]  By the way, they mine most of that in Florida.
[01:26:51.917 --> 01:26:53.618]  So they're big here, the phosphate industry.
[01:26:53.818 --> 01:26:54.338]  Absolutely.
[01:26:54.398 --> 01:26:57.340]  Most of the phosphate comes from Mosaic, a phosphate mining company.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.161]  Uranium mining as well.
[01:26:59.441 --> 01:27:01.682]  That's why there's all uranium in what they put in your water.
[01:27:02.003 --> 01:27:04.284]  Oh, what's wrong with uranium?
[01:27:05.069 --> 01:27:13.612]  Well, it says right on the water quality analysis that it's industrial discharge, and it's from, uh, we have alpha, beta photon emitters, and this is discharge.
[01:27:13.632 --> 01:27:13.872]  Good!
[01:27:14.252 --> 01:27:14.492]  Good!
[01:27:14.512 --> 01:27:15.532]  Give me radiation!
[01:27:15.912 --> 01:27:16.253]  Absolutely.
[01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:16.373]  Good!
[01:27:16.913 --> 01:27:20.834]  Absolutely, and it's- Yo, so, since I started exposing this in the last decade, they have newscasts.
[01:27:20.854 --> 01:27:23.575]  People go look, and they go, we don't know why there's radiation in there.
[01:27:23.835 --> 01:27:26.436]  Because the stinking cities are paying to add it!
[01:27:26.556 --> 01:27:26.976]  Ha ha!
[01:27:27.662 --> 01:27:27.882]  Yep.
[01:27:28.362 --> 01:27:37.065]  Yeah, and we have this Commissioner Ludval, I tell you, when she was confronted by this, she tried to say that, well, what Big Phosphate wants, Big Phosphate gets.
[01:27:37.205 --> 01:27:39.185]  Maybe in other counties, but not our county.
[01:27:39.345 --> 01:27:41.826]  What they're going to get is a revolution, and they're going to go to prison.
[01:27:42.006 --> 01:27:42.266]  Yes.
[01:27:42.486 --> 01:27:42.786]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.906 --> 01:27:43.106]  Yep.
[01:27:43.366 --> 01:27:44.086]  Running scared.
[01:27:44.387 --> 01:27:45.047]  Running scared.
[01:27:45.887 --> 01:27:51.028]  But people's children need photon emitters and radon and uranium.
[01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:52.929]  So are you saying uranium's not good for children's teeth?
[01:27:53.809 --> 01:28:03.332]  Well, to those, I would say they need to have a hair, blood, and nail analysis to see what their long-term exposure is to this toxin.
[01:28:03.952 --> 01:28:08.374]  Anybody who's pro-fluoride needs to be asked if they have the courage of their convictions.
[01:28:09.054 --> 01:28:14.197]  And while they're at it, they should also test those who they want to treat the guise of medication.
[01:28:14.237 --> 01:28:18.640]  It's not forced medication, it's forced toxification under the guise of medication.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:26.104]  And they also have to have their supplementation tested through nutritional blood analysis if they believe it ought to be on the RDA.
[01:28:26.204 --> 01:28:27.085]  And that's my next point.
[01:28:27.105 --> 01:28:28.185]  We need to start suing them.
[01:28:28.225 --> 01:28:36.390]  When scum like the Austin City Council doesn't remove it, we've had scientists and doctors down there, and 90 plus percent of the EPA's own scientists have gone public saying, take it out to Congress.
[01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:40.156]  When the mayor and people laugh at us, it's time for lawsuits.
[01:28:40.397 --> 01:28:43.022]  They pay to have tons of toxic chemicals.
[01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:45.686]  What's the website for We Are Change Tampa?
[01:28:46.385 --> 01:28:48.146]  We are changetampa.org.
[01:28:48.486 --> 01:28:49.807]  We are changetampa.org.
[01:28:49.887 --> 01:28:51.047]  Our site's infowars.com.
[01:28:51.227 --> 01:28:52.568]  Alright, thank you, brother.
[01:28:52.608 --> 01:28:53.108]  Thank you.
[01:28:53.429 --> 01:28:54.649]  Thank you for fighting tyranny.
[01:28:54.969 --> 01:28:58.011]  Alright, we'll be back with Orlando and worldwide!
[01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.472]  Yeah!
[01:29:00.052 --> 01:29:01.273]  Yeah!
[01:29:01.733 --> 01:29:02.413]  No more!
[01:29:02.453 --> 01:29:03.534]  We're breaking the trance!
[01:29:03.654 --> 01:29:04.454]  Breaking the hoax!
[01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:05.435]  We're awake!
[01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:08.416]  And we're coming for you, globalist trash murderers!
[01:29:08.756 --> 01:29:09.417]  Yeah!
[01:29:12.844 --> 01:29:16.465]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:16.805 --> 01:29:24.928]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:29:25.668 --> 01:29:29.709]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:41.113]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:29:41.753 --> 01:29:50.761]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:56.306]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:29:56.687 --> 01:30:03.873]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:04.193 --> 01:30:06.936]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:12.292]  I had tried everything.
[01:30:12.352 --> 01:30:17.414]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:22.315]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:22.655 --> 01:30:29.037]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:29.517 --> 01:30:40.005]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:40.746 --> 01:30:44.889]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:51.254]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:51.474 --> 01:30:52.615]  Now that's results.
[01:30:53.015 --> 01:31:05.170]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:07.793]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:31:08.093 --> 01:31:09.355]  Infowarsteam.com
[01:31:10.796 --> 01:31:12.058]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.118 --> 01:31:17.465]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:22.332]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:22.732 --> 01:31:23.113]  It's true.
[01:31:23.193 --> 01:31:27.759]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.983]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:33.504 --> 01:31:35.425]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:35.825 --> 01:31:40.428]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:41.529]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:41.749 --> 01:31:44.511]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:48.113]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:48.433 --> 01:31:51.275]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:51.616 --> 01:31:53.517]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:53.837 --> 01:31:54.778]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.103]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:07.146]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:07.466 --> 01:32:09.848]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:11.112 --> 01:32:15.797]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:30.693]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand, eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[01:33:01.134 --> 01:33:03.836]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:33:11.843 --> 01:33:14.744]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:15.444 --> 01:33:18.645]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.086]  I hear the American people and the people of the world getting angry at tyranny and awakening and saying, we're not your slaves.
[01:33:47.787 --> 01:33:50.850]  And the globalists certainly hear that awakening.
[01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:54.794]  Zbigniew Brzezinski a few years ago said the world is waking up to the global elites and they're in trouble.
[01:33:55.094 --> 01:33:59.038]  His new book says the biggest challenge they face is the awakening of their system.
[01:33:59.379 --> 01:34:02.222]  They can't just tell us like we're children, you know, go away, shut up.
[01:34:02.882 --> 01:34:14.970]  The New World Order hears you, all of you out there listening on AM, FM, you name it, and they certainly hear the people who are here in Orlando as things fill up to over a thousand people.
[01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.470]  Yeah!
[01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:17.952]  Here, let them hear you!
[01:34:26.257 --> 01:34:27.258]  Man, I love that sound.
[01:34:28.308 --> 01:34:33.491]  You know, I've gotten kind of reclusive, except when I occasionally storm the Capitol or go out and do whatever.
[01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:35.872]  But I need to get out more.
[01:34:35.892 --> 01:34:36.632]  This is fun.
[01:34:37.193 --> 01:34:38.353]  I can really feel the energy.
[01:34:40.114 --> 01:34:47.958]  It is so good to be here around people that are looking for freedom, looking for liberty, and realize the world's going in the wrong direction.
[01:34:47.978 --> 01:34:50.220]  Listen, the world's always going in the wrong direction.
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.921]  It's also going in the right direction always.
[01:34:52.181 --> 01:34:54.242]  There's a lot of complex things happening in our world.
[01:34:55.427 --> 01:35:01.714]  And it's always up to good people versus bad people who is going to direct the direction of society.
[01:35:01.734 --> 01:35:06.199]  And we're simply here saying, hey, we've let you little central banker experts run things long enough.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:11.886]  And now you're not just going to be able to pat us on the head and have us shut up.
[01:35:12.266 --> 01:35:14.849]  We're awake, we're staring, and we're
[01:35:16.408 --> 01:35:24.618]  We're gathering data, and we're getting more information, and we're reaching out to others, and we are coming for the new world order.
[01:35:24.858 --> 01:35:25.278]  Period.
[01:35:30.643 --> 01:35:38.647]  You know, I would take calls today, but all the radio audience is hearing is me talking and people cheering.
[01:35:38.767 --> 01:35:46.410]  And then, because it would feed back, we're not running the feed of the audio out to this big auditorium, so that you would not be able to hear the callers.
[01:35:47.731 --> 01:35:53.834]  And, as a triple whammy, we have a special phone number for the Sunday show, and I haven't even memorized that.
[01:35:54.714 --> 01:35:58.116]  The last six years giving it out, I guess because they changed it a few months ago, that's probably why.
[01:35:58.696 --> 01:36:02.018]  But I probably should write that number down and give it out and take a few calls.
[01:36:02.538 --> 01:36:05.800]  I know there was probably a few other people I might want to get on air if they want to come on with us.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:15.145]  But I'd actually have to go over there and talk to some of the other talk show hosts during the break, because I only talked to a few people before I went live here on air, and I've got all this other news here in front of me.
[01:36:15.945 --> 01:36:22.308]  We've got a comical video I did, French Bulldogs Caught Working for Al-CIA-DA.
[01:36:23.228 --> 01:36:27.070]  And, uh, trust no one but our loving government is the sub-headline of that video.
[01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:32.712]  Also, a biometric, uh, biocratic feeding frenzy.
[01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:34.733]  Economists and biologists weigh in.
[01:36:35.153 --> 01:36:36.753]  This is a point I want to raise right now.
[01:36:36.893 --> 01:36:43.176]  I saw some really incredible news Friday and forgot to cover it for whatever reason because I've covered it so much in the past.
[01:36:43.656 --> 01:36:44.797]  It's now come to fruition.
[01:36:46.098 --> 01:36:52.543]  But I've covered it so much in the past that even though now it's a big news story, I didn't cover it, but I want to cover it right now.
[01:36:53.384 --> 01:36:57.828]  And that's something I'm going to talk about in my speech more tonight, is real threats facing humanity.
[01:36:58.248 --> 01:37:01.871]  We defeat the New World Order by realizing just how crazy and out of control they are.
[01:37:02.311 --> 01:37:06.234]  It's not just that they're dictatorial people, they also aren't really in control.
[01:37:06.434 --> 01:37:11.539]  They're able to blow stuff up, take over, dominate, but they're not really in control of everything.
[01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:15.041]  They're trying to get in control of everything, but they're not even in control of themselves.
[01:37:16.312 --> 01:37:16.872]  And the U.S.
[01:37:16.912 --> 01:37:20.294]  government has decided, with major U.S.
[01:37:20.374 --> 01:37:37.442]  universities, to go ahead and start publishing all of the weaponized bird flu, weaponized airborne Ebola, weaponized, you name it, all of the hundreds of different variants of flu, Ebola, all sorts of other nasty nasties.
[01:37:37.862 --> 01:37:40.724]  They're going to start publishing how they made it.
[01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:43.279]  This is all in defense, of course.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.203]  Hundreds and hundreds of Level 4 bioweapons facilities under the BioShield program.
[01:37:50.703 --> 01:37:51.924]  But it's under defense.
[01:37:51.944 --> 01:37:54.025]  Kind of like bombing Libya is defense.
[01:37:54.485 --> 01:37:55.846]  Or not even defense, it's peace!
[01:37:56.526 --> 01:37:57.647]  It's better than defense.
[01:37:57.727 --> 01:37:58.987]  It's not even defending yourself.
[01:37:59.027 --> 01:38:02.329]  It's not even violence to drop a 2,000 pound bomb on an apartment building.
[01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.350]  So it's not war.
[01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:05.251]  It's defense research.
[01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:11.453]  To create, quote, thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[01:38:11.934 --> 01:38:15.675]  That was the Baltimore Sun many years ago when they first launched this latest phase in 2002.
[01:38:16.175 --> 01:38:20.516]  The latest then, they just launched another one last year to build more of these.
[01:38:20.917 --> 01:38:26.718]  And they put level four bio weapons labs in level two facilities where you just wear a mask and do a swipe card.
[01:38:27.539 --> 01:38:29.559]  And they're on the coastlines like Galveston, Texas.
[01:38:29.579 --> 01:38:30.420]  I've talked a lot about that.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.461]  But now, it was like six, seven years ago, U.S.
[01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:36.342]  scientists and Australian scientists
[01:38:37.362 --> 01:38:59.925]  Separately released their mousepox finding and for just a few hundred thousand dollars Any lab could replicate this for humans or any other mammal they wish and it kills 98 to 99 percent of the mammals that you tailor it for so you release this it kills over 90 percent That's nine out of ten people on your block deader than a doornail
[01:39:00.888 --> 01:39:01.809]  Go to the police station.
[01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:04.892]  That's 90% of the cops or more dead.
[01:39:05.874 --> 01:39:08.096]  Go to an auto parts store, 90% of the workers dead.
[01:39:08.316 --> 01:39:09.778]  Go to your church, 90% of them dead.
[01:39:10.038 --> 01:39:12.441]  You got 10 children, 9 of them are dead.
[01:39:14.063 --> 01:39:18.307]  And they've just got all these in level 2 facilities everywhere, but that's not enough.
[01:39:18.387 --> 01:39:19.408]  They're gonna release
[01:39:21.067 --> 01:39:25.030]  Because they had a debate about this, whatever it was, five, six years ago, seven years ago, about the mousepox.
[01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.910]  You can look it up.
[01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:30.033]  Well, now they're having a debate about weaponized airborne bird flu.
[01:39:31.054 --> 01:39:37.538]  Oh, we're always hyping how it's going to get you, and the government dug up the swine flu that killed 30, 40, 50 million.
[01:39:37.558 --> 01:39:38.619]  They debate how many it killed.
[01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:46.266]  And they've spliced all those together, and, oh, don't worry, this bird flu is only killing 80-something percent of people that comes in contact from their projections.
[01:39:47.267 --> 01:39:50.671]  And the airborne Ebola, 90-something, was it 92 percent they estimate?
[01:39:50.711 --> 01:39:56.817]  They got that, and they got weaponized Lyme disease, and weaponized rabies, and just everything.
[01:39:57.237 --> 01:39:58.518]  Just your tax money building it.
[01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:01.121]  And they declassified in 2000.
[01:40:01.321 --> 01:40:03.963]  The Marine Corps freaked out and demanded it be reclassified.
[01:40:04.304 --> 01:40:07.867]  Marine Corps studies on helicopters delivering different sprays over U.S.
[01:40:07.907 --> 01:40:08.508]  populations.
[01:40:09.108 --> 01:40:11.270]  And of course now they have the drones to do that.
[01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:17.155]  Even if the military knew what was in the canisters on the helicopters or drones, now it doesn't matter because they'll just have the drones do it.
[01:40:18.217 --> 01:40:20.358]  And, you know, this is the type of stuff I'm concerned about.
[01:40:20.759 --> 01:40:24.781]  Not somebody who might blow up an airplane, you know, every five years.
[01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:28.404]  Okay, it's scary, it's in movies, they teach me to be scared of it.
[01:40:28.704 --> 01:40:37.230]  No, I'm scared of stuff that... I saw an article a few years ago, it was at Washington Post, where they admitted a weaponized bird flu of this type is estimated to kill
[01:40:38.283 --> 01:40:42.406]  Between, I don't know how bad it would get, 500 and 3 billion people.
[01:40:42.827 --> 01:40:47.811]  I don't know, excuse me, 500 million or 3 billion people.
[01:40:48.031 --> 01:40:49.032]  500 million sounds pretty bad.
[01:40:49.532 --> 01:40:58.940]  But you see, is there a group who has been caught in the past who we might worry about releasing something like this?
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.822]  Yes, the global elite that we have running things
[01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:25.884]  are a group of people who have been caught over and over again saying they want to reduce world population saying that they want to do this and then reemerge from their bunkers with some heavenly new future world without the general ugly public as they call us and they're they're putting big seed vaults underground they're big big DNA vaults of every animal species underground on record
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.821]  I'd talk about it 10 years ago and it'd be called a crazy cook.
[01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:30.961]  Now it's just mainstream-ish.
[01:41:31.321 --> 01:41:34.622]  So they're obviously getting ready and considering releasing this.
[01:41:35.142 --> 01:41:38.543]  So I can joke around, I can make jokes, I can say, let's get ready to rumble.
[01:41:38.943 --> 01:41:40.304]  A lot of that is gallows humor.
[01:41:41.704 --> 01:41:43.905]  I'm sorry this is the reality, but it's a fact.
[01:41:44.805 --> 01:41:57.690]  And they're clearly proliferating the ingredients and the recipes for this so that when it gets leaked out they can blame it on research scientists or whatever for the official histories after our population is reduced.
[01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:01.471]  And I have to tell you there is a strong chance
[01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:15.299]  I can't put a number on it, but it is strongly being considered, and pre-programmed, and pre-tested, and beta-tested, and rolled out, and the public's being conditioned for a post-human world, a post-civilization world.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:26.827]  We're being told how beautiful and wonderful it'll be on Discovery Channel and History Channel, and at grocery stores I go to for two years, there's little end caps about the world after humans, and magazines, and DVDs, and books on tape,
[01:42:27.347 --> 01:42:29.547]  And oh, it's going to be so cool when we're all dead.
[01:42:30.008 --> 01:42:38.749]  So we're just being taught how wonderful it is and they're building bunkers and building seed vaults and the elite are all racing to island redoubts with bunkers.
[01:42:39.309 --> 01:42:41.170]  I don't know if they're planning to release it.
[01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:44.290]  They talk about how they may.
[01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:48.971]  Dick Cheney writes about race-specific bioweapons in the September 20, 2000 PNAC documents.
[01:42:49.252 --> 01:42:53.852]  But I think this is a bigger issue than giving up all our rights because al Qaeda is so scary.
[01:42:54.032 --> 01:42:55.673]  We'll be right back from Orlando.
[01:42:55.693 --> 01:42:56.093]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.773 --> 01:42:58.113]  Yeah!
[01:43:04.158 --> 01:43:07.041]  Infowars.com!
[01:43:07.882 --> 01:43:09.123]  Humanity's awake!
[01:43:11.365 --> 01:43:16.869]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:22.775]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:43:23.175 --> 01:43:25.077]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:43:27.236 --> 01:43:29.962]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:43:31.886 --> 01:43:34.311]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:43:35.954 --> 01:43:38.319]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:43:40.376 --> 01:43:44.237]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:43:44.957 --> 01:43:48.078]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:43:48.799 --> 01:43:49.619]  Others don't.
[01:43:50.019 --> 01:43:51.900]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.680]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.521]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:43:56.841 --> 01:44:03.103]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:44:06.164 --> 01:44:08.204]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:44:08.545 --> 01:44:09.405]  Others don't.
[01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:17.653]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:44:17.893 --> 01:44:35.523]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:44:35.784 --> 01:44:39.886]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:44:40.166 --> 01:44:41.747]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:44:41.947 --> 01:44:49.772]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:44:50.093 --> 01:44:56.357]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:44:56.417 --> 01:44:57.458]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:44:57.698 --> 01:44:58.418]  It's incredible.
[01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:07.604]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:45:07.785 --> 01:45:09.626]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:45:10.466 --> 01:45:14.707]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:45:15.027 --> 01:45:15.627]  Number one.
[01:45:15.947 --> 01:45:19.088]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:45:19.368 --> 01:45:19.928]  Number two.
[01:45:20.228 --> 01:45:24.769]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.549]  It's true.
[01:45:25.849 --> 01:45:30.410]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:31.270]  Number three.
[01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.830]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:38.831]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:39.051 --> 01:45:39.592]  Number 4.
[01:45:39.832 --> 01:45:42.194]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:42.595 --> 01:45:45.978]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:45:46.279 --> 01:45:46.499]  Number 5.
[01:45:47.079 --> 01:45:51.004]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:45:51.224 --> 01:45:55.989]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:56.269 --> 01:46:00.294]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:00.434 --> 01:46:01.996]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:02.236 --> 01:46:04.299]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:46:04.479 --> 01:46:06.822]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:46:11.345 --> 01:46:12.847]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:13.047 --> 01:46:18.094]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:46:18.374 --> 01:46:19.736]  Saving means to make money.
[01:46:19.897 --> 01:46:28.688]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:46:29.409 --> 01:46:36.513]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:46:36.953 --> 01:46:44.557]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:46:44.958 --> 01:46:49.880]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.342]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:19.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:29.076 --> 01:47:37.339]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:14.141 --> 01:48:22.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here in Orlando where I'm getting ready to speak to a capacity crowd of over a thousand people.
[01:48:23.325 --> 01:48:24.365]  Thank you for coming out.
[01:48:24.445 --> 01:48:25.106]  You're awesome.
[01:48:25.126 --> 01:48:25.726]  God bless you.
[01:48:27.757 --> 01:48:29.639]  Okay, buddy, you're the host of Free Radicals.
[01:48:29.659 --> 01:48:33.442]  Tell folks about the work you're doing and what you think of the Liberty Movement.
[01:48:33.682 --> 01:48:34.062]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:34.082 --> 01:48:35.163]  My name's John Kirch.
[01:48:35.203 --> 01:48:41.608]  I'm the host of Free Radical Radio on the Big 8, 10 a.m., Monday through Friday, 7 to 8, freeradicalorlando.com is the website.
[01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:44.511]  And I'm more of an activist.
[01:48:44.571 --> 01:48:48.674]  I consider myself an activist who just happens to have a radio show at the moment.
[01:48:49.835 --> 01:48:55.779]  Because I just found this radio show because I found myself getting arrested too much doing other types of activism.
[01:48:55.799 --> 01:49:04.165]  I got upset with the police brutality happening in Orlando, so I founded a group called Orlando Copwatch, orlandocopwatch.com, where we go out and film police brutality.
[01:49:04.205 --> 01:49:08.749]  During one such incident, I was arrested and they threw me in a cage for a while, so I gave that up.
[01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:17.155]  I did a lot of jury outreach, letting people know they had the right, people on a jury have the right to vote people not guilty if they disagree with the law.
[01:49:17.615 --> 01:49:18.796]  Well, I'll tell you what's beautiful.
[01:49:40.339 --> 01:49:47.221]  I'll tell you what's beautiful about what you're doing is you were having your First Amendment violated, and so you took action.
[01:49:47.241 --> 01:49:53.542]  You upped your activism by getting on the air, and that's what everybody should do, and that's what the globalists can't stand.
[01:49:53.902 --> 01:50:00.624]  If everybody starts a YouTube channel or gets a local radio show, it's not as hard as you think to get on local radio if you've got passion and talent.
[01:50:01.044 --> 01:50:04.865]  I mean, I'm just another average person that got tired of tyranny and took action as well.
[01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:08.406]  Tell folks about some of the stuff that's happened here locally to your First Amendment.
[01:50:08.926 --> 01:50:20.476]  Yeah, here locally, for example, at the Orange County Courthouse, Judge Belvin Perry will stick you in a cage for 150 days if you hand out information regarding jury's rights.
[01:50:20.596 --> 01:50:22.638]  No jury, no trial, no nothing.
[01:50:22.658 --> 01:50:24.239]  Judge Perry will stick you in a cage for 150 days.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.321]  He thinks he's God.
[01:50:26.441 --> 01:50:27.422]  He does think he's God.
[01:50:27.502 --> 01:50:30.825]  You know, this is a guy who, uh, he stuck Julian Haiklin in the cage.
[01:50:31.025 --> 01:50:36.030]  Well, Julian Haiklin is a great activist, and he actually was on the front lines of the civil rights movement.
[01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:40.034]  If Julian Haiklin hadn't done what he'd done, Judge Perry might not be a judge right now.
[01:50:40.494 --> 01:50:41.435]  So, it's ridiculous.
[01:50:41.475 --> 01:50:44.698]  Uh, for example, you're not allowed to feed homeless people in Orlando.
[01:50:44.718 --> 01:50:45.759]  They throw you in a cage for that.
[01:50:45.779 --> 01:50:47.660]  Yeah, we've all seen those incredible videos.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.682]  But again, this is tyranny when a judge says you can't give people jury nullification.
[01:50:51.722 --> 01:50:54.324]  By the way, we give a packet of that away with every order we have.
[01:50:54.624 --> 01:50:56.165]  That's our citizen rulebook.
[01:50:56.225 --> 01:50:57.866]  You judge the law as well as the facts.
[01:50:58.186 --> 01:50:58.486]  Absolutely.
[01:50:58.506 --> 01:50:59.847]  I mean, that's what juries are supposed to do.
[01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:05.410]  It's like northern juries who wouldn't put people that protected folks.
[01:51:06.891 --> 01:51:10.113]  I know because we're doing the radio show, folks, and some of this wasn't hooked up right.
[01:51:10.433 --> 01:51:11.874]  We're barely on air right now, okay?
[01:51:12.674 --> 01:51:17.635]  Now listen, going back, the crowd can't hear us because I'm having to just move microphones back and forth here.
[01:51:17.975 --> 01:51:29.217]  The point is, is that they had people who protected black slaves who were running away, and northern juries would let the people off, even though there were northern laws against helping people.
[01:51:29.417 --> 01:51:30.277]  Because it's bull!
[01:51:30.697 --> 01:51:33.698]  Laws that are unconstitutional and unconscionable are bull!
[01:51:33.938 --> 01:51:35.938]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says!
[01:51:36.218 --> 01:51:38.139]  We're done playing games!
[01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:39.379]  Who is this tyrant judge?
[01:51:39.939 --> 01:51:41.681]  That's Chief Judge Belvin Perry.
[01:51:41.721 --> 01:51:44.002]  Many people may know him as the Casey Anthony Judge.
[01:51:44.203 --> 01:51:46.264]  He's the Chief Judge of Orange and Osceola Counties.
[01:51:46.665 --> 01:51:54.171]  And yeah, he just, he wrote an executive or a judicial order that said, you cannot, there is no First Amendment at the courthouse.
[01:51:54.311 --> 01:51:56.532]  I will stick you in a cage for 150 days.
[01:51:56.613 --> 01:51:58.594]  No jury, no trial, no nothing.
[01:51:58.674 --> 01:51:59.515]  You're going to a cage.
[01:51:59.815 --> 01:52:03.757]  Because he's God, and we've got to let all these petty dictators know they are not our gods.
[01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:05.257]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:52:05.297 --> 01:52:09.119]  Judge Perry, by the way, is up for re-election, so get out there.
[01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:11.000]  Don't let this guy be a judge any longer.
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:11.380]  He's a tyrant.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:13.681]  And there's judicial tyrants all over the place.
[01:52:13.981 --> 01:52:14.501]  Absolutely.
[01:52:15.022 --> 01:52:18.583]  For example, also here, I mean, I was arrested for filming a police officer.
[01:52:18.603 --> 01:52:24.586]  The police officer lied, said I assaulted him, stole my camera, destroyed the evidence, and they stuck me in a cage for 30 days.
[01:52:25.126 --> 01:52:27.929]  Well, that's happening all over the place now when another camera tapes it.
[01:52:27.949 --> 01:52:32.393]  Like when they shot the guy in the back in handcuffs and said he was attacking them, but somebody else had videotaped it.
[01:52:32.653 --> 01:52:37.138]  That's why they're trying to put people in jail for life now.
[01:52:37.398 --> 01:52:38.519]  Alright, man, thanks for talking to us.
[01:52:38.539 --> 01:52:38.819]  Thank you.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.984]  Yeah, the system is now trying to put people in jail for life.
[01:52:45.246 --> 01:52:46.267]  For life.
[01:52:48.131 --> 01:52:49.591]  All right, let's kill this other mic now, okay?
[01:52:49.771 --> 01:52:51.352]  Let's kill this one.
[01:52:51.412 --> 01:52:53.172]  Or I could just get on every one of the microphones here.
[01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:54.353]  We'll do this.
[01:52:54.453 --> 01:52:54.853]  Ah, yeah!
[01:52:55.013 --> 01:52:55.493]  Ha ha!
[01:52:55.533 --> 01:52:56.733]  Ha ha ha!
[01:52:57.834 --> 01:52:59.814]  All right, man, it is fun being on the road.
[01:53:00.154 --> 01:53:04.196]  This is basically like our, uh, beta test, uh, here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:04.236 --> 01:53:12.798]  And I want to say great job to my crew, great job to 810, uh, the big 810, when we're number one, uh, noon to 3 p.m.
[01:53:12.878 --> 01:53:16.039]  Eastern, 11 to 2 Central, uh, here in town.
[01:53:18.263 --> 01:53:35.558]  Again, I just want to say great job to all of you because you are here because you're tired of the tyranny, you're not the system's slave, and you're standing up and saying, we don't have a First Amendment or property rights or a Second Amendment because you give us permission.
[01:53:35.878 --> 01:53:39.602]  We got it because it was earned with blood and it's ours!
[01:53:44.963 --> 01:53:50.631]  And anybody that says it isn't our right is a tyrant of the worst order!
[01:53:50.832 --> 01:53:55.639]  That means a government criminal thug trying to dominate you!
[01:53:57.521 --> 01:54:02.484]  And all over this country, I've seen them try to put people in prison for life in Illinois.
[01:54:03.285 --> 01:54:04.986]  That's right.
[01:54:05.286 --> 01:54:07.047]  In fact, what was the guy's first name?
[01:54:07.127 --> 01:54:07.868]  Something Allison.
[01:54:07.908 --> 01:54:08.749]  Guys, look that up.
[01:54:08.889 --> 01:54:13.111]  Illinois man faces life in prison for filming police.
[01:54:13.932 --> 01:54:15.493]  Look that up and give me Allison's first name.
[01:54:15.533 --> 01:54:16.294]  I keep forgetting it.
[01:54:16.314 --> 01:54:17.074]  It's driving me crazy.
[01:54:17.134 --> 01:54:18.795]  It's like a splinter in my brain.
[01:54:19.236 --> 01:54:26.761]  And the state came down to the county and did an ambiguous brief saying, yes, we want life in prison for him, taping police, towing cars from his house.
[01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:32.322]  Okay, it's not wiretapping to tape the police, and it's not anti-police.
[01:54:32.642 --> 01:54:36.283]  Police, you are Americans too.
[01:54:37.023 --> 01:54:39.423]  You have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:54:39.684 --> 01:54:42.184]  They're there for a reason.
[01:54:42.504 --> 01:54:46.945]  They're there to protect your rights and your future as well.
[01:54:47.645 --> 01:54:51.186]  All of these cop shows, all these movies I've seen out as I monitor it,
[01:54:51.986 --> 01:54:57.109]  The Constitution is the enemy, and the good guy cops talk bad about the Constitution.
[01:54:57.509 --> 01:55:00.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to turn us against each other.
[01:55:01.051 --> 01:55:07.615]  And police, you're the one cramming cameras down our throats all the time in public, saying no perception of privacy, and that's true.
[01:55:08.035 --> 01:55:15.179]  Then don't put people in jail and try to have kept juries put people in prison for simply exercising their First Amendment.
[01:55:15.519 --> 01:55:20.382]  This country is turning into a fascist police state, as I have said for years.
[01:55:21.042 --> 01:55:35.055]  And now, as Ron Paul has said, and we've got to reach out to the military and the police, who are Americans as well, who are starting to wake up, because they will be the instruments, just like they've been in every other tyranny, against the people.
[01:55:35.496 --> 01:55:40.440]  They are the groups that the New World Order plans to use against the population.
[01:55:41.221 --> 01:55:54.267]  So we've got to reach out to them, and we've got to work hard while the internet is still free and open, to keep it free and open, and we've got to use it now because they could shut it down with a fake cyber attack or other system.
[01:55:54.528 --> 01:55:56.308]  We have got to work now!
[01:55:56.809 --> 01:56:04.893]  Just the 1,100 people or so that are here tonight, I can go anywhere in the country and get 1,000, 2,000 people out.
[01:56:05.193 --> 01:56:09.335]  That's because, ladies and gentlemen, liberty is popular!
[01:56:09.775 --> 01:56:18.304]  And we are the majority, and we have right on our side, and the hoax that is the New World Order is coming down!
[01:56:22.429 --> 01:56:27.132]  So I salute all of you for being out here this evening.
[01:56:27.453 --> 01:56:33.217]  And I salute Carl, the program director and station manager here, Carl Como.
[01:56:33.457 --> 01:56:36.219]  I salute all the talk show hosts and people involved.
[01:56:36.279 --> 01:56:37.420]  I've been on a lot of their shows.
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:38.481]  Great people.
[01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:41.203]  Doc Holliday, the Free Radicals folks, everybody.
[01:56:41.223 --> 01:56:46.927]  And I salute great local talk show hosts on local AM and FM's across this country because
[01:56:47.487 --> 01:57:07.211]  More and more I'm hearing the message of liberty and awakening and sophisticated political thought that transcends left-right paradigm and gets down to right and wrong, liberty versus tyranny, freedom versus slavery, and we've got to simply put that choice out and the people will choose liberty every single time.
[01:57:07.451 --> 01:57:09.351]  But the battle is on now.
[01:57:09.711 --> 01:57:11.452]  The war is on now.
[01:57:12.816 --> 01:57:14.557]  For radio listeners, that's about it.
[01:57:14.577 --> 01:57:18.319]  We're about to go out and end the show, but I'll be back Tuesday live.
[01:57:18.379 --> 01:57:25.164]  Mike Adams, the incredible talk show host, and of course the head of NaturalNews.com will be filling in tomorrow with some big guest lineup, 11 a.m.
[01:57:25.184 --> 01:57:25.604]  to 2 p.m.
[01:57:25.624 --> 01:57:25.984]  Central.
[01:57:26.505 --> 01:57:29.707]  And I'll be calling in, of course, and shooting video reports from the road that they're going to be playing.
[01:57:29.727 --> 01:57:33.109]  I'll be back Tuesday and Wednesday, and then back in Austin, Texas.
[01:57:34.449 --> 01:57:37.071]  So that's basically it for this edition.
[01:57:37.091 --> 01:57:43.994]  I want to let you guys take us out as we get ready to show the film and give a speech and I'll have a question and answer.
[01:57:44.635 --> 01:57:50.018]  The listeners of Big 8, Ken and others and InfoWars.com, I salute you!
[01:57:51.939 --> 01:57:52.319]  Yeah!
[01:57:52.339 --> 01:57:54.780]  Yeah!
