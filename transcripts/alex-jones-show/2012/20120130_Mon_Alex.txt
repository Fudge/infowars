[00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:07.592]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:09.293]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:11.214]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:12.595]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:14.315]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:18.457]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:23.199]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:48.561]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.244]  I am your host Alex Jones, the
[00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.281]  Date, of course, is the 30th of January, 2012.
[00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:09.418]  And we're going to be here live for the next three hours, then we'll be back this evening, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News, of course, at InfoWarsNews.com and Prison Planet.
[00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:17.175]  Okay, here is the conundrum, or the pickle, or the dilemma.
[00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:19.876]  I've got to cover all the news.
[00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:37.226]  It's just all off the charts, getting more insane by the minute, confirming all of our analysis about the globalists and their plans, from police state, to censorship, to massive taxation, with a cashless society being used to absolutely rape everyone and destroy the economy by design while they do it.
[00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:43.898]  Once they put the cash flow system in place completely, you think five bucks to use your ATM is going to be bad?
[00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.541]  There's going to be all these global taxes, you name it.
[00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:55.965]  We're already seeing it in Europe under the engineered austerity that we told you in 99 was coming once they imploded the derivative scandal.
[00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:00.687]  We predicted right around 2011-2012 because it's all a plan.
[00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.129]  You can see the progression of it.
[00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:05.565]  There's not even really dots to connect.
[00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:18.488]  It's like one of those connect-the-dots you give a three-year-old, where the numbers are right beside each other, and you can see that it's a dinosaur, you can see that it's a parakeet, you can see it's a horse, a monkey, a kitty cat.
[00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:21.228]  I mean, you don't even need to connect the dots.
[00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:28.430]  I mean, it's like a jigsaw puzzle that's got 500 pieces, and 495 of them are in place.
[00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.330]  There's five more little pieces to stick in.
[00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.231]  I mean, it's not hard.
[00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:33.531]  Not hard!
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:54.517]  But if you're unconscious and still believe the old propaganda that there's no global elite, there's no special insider interest, that there's nothing corrupt going on, just trust the nice people that run the government and the big corporations that have bought and paid for them, never mind.
[00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:57.780]  Everything is just so wonderful.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:16.805]  And then the system sits there with bought and paid for, prostitute, prostitute media, pointing at those of us that are awake and live in the real world, and go, ha ha ha, they think there's a corrupt government and a global corporate government being set up, when it's in all the admitted documents, world leaders are all admitting it.
[00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:22.167]  They're like, ha ha, look, they're reporting on absolute admitted facts, ha ha ha!
[00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:29.050]  And they count on people being so into trendiness, so into peer pressure, that they laugh at us.
[00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.231]  It still happens, not as much as it used to.
[00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:36.252]  Instead, a lot of people now aren't laughing.
[00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:37.752]  They're going, OK, you're right about this.
[00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:38.353]  What do we do?
[00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:39.913]  We don't have any power.
[00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:45.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, they wouldn't be setting up this police state and openly trying to censor the Internet.
[00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:48.736]  And I got some really bad news on the Internet front.
[00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:50.316]  I mean, this is moving quicker than I thought.
[00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:52.717]  You think we dodged a bullet on SOPA?
[00:03:54.565 --> 00:04:03.155]  That's like if you've got a firing squad of 20 guys in front of you all aiming 30-odd sixes at you at 10 yards away, and one idiot misfires and misses you.
[00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:08.582]  And as I said, it's because the global corporations, they want
[00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:17.766]  The decisions and entreaties that private corporations are signing on to with governments, they want to be the enforcers, not government.
[00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:28.310]  We're entering this phase now where the extreme privatization is nothing but government signing government powers illegally over to megacorporations.
[00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.573]  Remember, the 100 biggest economies, more than half of them are corporations.
[00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:40.566]  Of the one, look it up, of the 100 biggest economies, how do you look it up?
[00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:44.348]  Put it in an NSA crystal ball Google system.
[00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:46.250]  That's what it is.
[00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.432]  Put the info in, and you'll see them singing.
[00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:57.318]  Of the 100 biggest economies, 50 plus, a couple years ago it was like 51, and we've crossed that Rubicon.
[00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.561]  They're corporations, they've got their own armies, spies, hit teams.
[00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.912]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:10.177]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:10.437 --> 00:05:11.798]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:20.767]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:28.592]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:36.636]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:41.959]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.421]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:50.127]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:52.631]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:54.914]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.984]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:10.347]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:10.587 --> 00:06:15.371]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:21.637]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:24.020]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.820]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.100]  Bernanke?
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.521]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:26.261]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:27.742]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:50.377]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:06:50.717 --> 00:06:59.847]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.801]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:09.882]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.763]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:19.745]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:23.446]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:07:23.466 --> 00:07:28.388]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:29.208]  Your greatest
[00:07:29.428 --> 00:07:30.268]  We're good to go.
[00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:57.846]  Or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:00.970]  Remember, you can bet your life on efoods direct.
[00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:09.820]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:13.424]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:28.332]  Okay, we're going to have Dr. Katherine Albrecht joining us.
[00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:35.938]  She's a, of course, journalist as well, who for a long time has been reporting on the surveillance police state grid.
[00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:53.857]  She's going to be joining us in the third hour today to talk about Google's new user policies where they admit that basically everything you do is going to be tracked and going to be used and going to be tied together from all Google platforms.
[00:08:54.847 --> 00:09:10.550]  From Google smartphones, the droids, right through to your searches, to where you shop online, to your habits, to the movies you're purchasing, your psychological profile will be integrated in to their social network systems.
[00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:18.612]  It'll be integrated into YouTube and all of it cross-referenced, popping up, tailor-made ads, but also telling your friends and family
[00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.155]  Where you've been shopping, what you've been doing, saying, hey, Bob went here, Bob did this.
[00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:26.717]  Do you think you'll like what Bob's doing?
[00:09:27.578 --> 00:09:38.489]  That's the incredible creepiness that Facebook's had, of course, for several years now, where when you want to log into your own account, they say, here's this individual from your high school.
[00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:42.674]  Confirm that this is the person from your high school.
[00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:56.312]  This happened to Darren McBreen on his Facebook, it's happened to us on our official Facebook, and you're there, you can't even remember, you're like, yeah, I vaguely, I vaguely remember that name and that person, but I mean, they're an adult now.
[00:09:57.033 --> 00:10:09.278]  I can't really, it's wanting you to ping that data so they can have HUMET, or human intelligence, with the AI interface to know if that is indeed someone that you knew in high school.
[00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:15.395]  And then you think that you're just, oh, proving to it that you're really logging into your Facebook.
[00:10:16.936 --> 00:10:18.336]  And they build these big maps with it.
[00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:20.597]  It is beyond ultra-creepy.
[00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:39.845]  And on the Internet takeover front, remember, the washers, the dryers, the entertainment centers, your television, the household appliances, especially the refrigerator, almost all of the new ones, and this is global standardization,
[00:10:41.704 --> 00:11:02.118]  Corporations actually tell the government, globally, the governments, they have big meetings, how to standardize, what systems to go with, and they have debates about it and things, and sometimes you'll see something like Blu-ray versus HD, disc, and there'll be a fight between two global companies, and then one comes out on top like Blu-ray, but generally it's globally standardized.
[00:11:03.157 --> 00:11:12.703]  And back doors are built in under regulation, and in some countries under law, where your cell phone tracks you, where they can dial in and listen to you, even when your phone's turned off.
[00:11:13.103 --> 00:11:16.265]  That was put into regulatory law in 1996.
[00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.047]  I know I belabor that point.
[00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:20.468]  It's just this stuff is so standardized.
[00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:21.349]  Take India.
[00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:22.870]  They just passed a new internet
[00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:24.565]  I don't know.
[00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:53.978]  You hold your phone up to be able to get, your smartphone to be able to get online, or your PC or whatever the case is, and it says sorry.
[00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.480]  And then somebody else logs on for you, they then get banned.
[00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:03.621]  I mean, this is the total control.
[00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:15.225]  And then everything's going to be on these clouds, and so the globalists can put out one directive, and this is in all these treaties, and every website not authorized to quote have a certain song,
[00:12:16.283 --> 00:12:17.804]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:22.205]  The song is erased off of the servers.
[00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:27.106]  And there's global standardization in the Cybersecurity Act.
[00:12:27.807 --> 00:12:31.488]  There was an article, a press release by Homeland Security last Friday we covered.
[00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:42.236]  Put out by them saying Homeland Security at Davos gets agreement from other nations on global standardization of all commerce, buying and selling.
[00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:44.558]  And they're going to tie it to biometrics.
[00:12:45.038 --> 00:13:00.331]  And once the biometrics are in place, where you just walk into the store, you'll still swipe the card, still give the code, but the face scanning camera will authenticate that you're using the card, that you're engaged in it.
[00:13:02.236 --> 00:13:12.106]  Constantly you hear about murders, crimes, rapes, and the police never release the videos, or it's never recording at the time, and that's all lies.
[00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.048]  The system wants the crime.
[00:13:14.728 --> 00:13:23.457]  So they only selectively, I could take you to the town I live in in Austin, to East 11th, all these places, I could show you crack dealers, prostitutes, no one stops them.
[00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:34.064]  Now if you don't pay your cut to the criminal boss above you who's paying off city officials and government people, you'll get shut down.
[00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:36.945]  But the point is, it's all scripted.
[00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.847]  It's all organized crime.
[00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:52.015]  You know that case of the West Point grad, I guess he was a, what was it, a captain over in Iraq?
[00:13:52.655 --> 00:13:53.316]  Yeah, he was a captain.
[00:13:54.437 --> 00:13:55.497]  Honorably discharged.
[00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.980]  And we've had him in studio a few times.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.381]  And it's on the news.
[00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:05.882]  The police say we're not going to release our dash cam video.
[00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:09.523]  Because of our ongoing investigation.
[00:14:10.084 --> 00:14:16.586]  This is a guy sees a police officer jumping on and reportedly beating a woman at a 7-Eleven parking lot.
[00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:19.468]  He starts taking photos of it.
[00:14:19.488 --> 00:14:20.808]  He had an old phone.
[00:14:20.828 --> 00:14:21.989]  Says he's going to get a smartphone.
[00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.037]  A tracker phone.
[00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:27.980]  And he was taking photos at about 10 feet away, 15 feet away.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.960]  He was there at the gas pump.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.862]  This all starts in the gas pump next to him when they pull her over.
[00:14:34.183 --> 00:14:39.486]  They're beating up the woman out of the passenger seat, according to his report and other witnesses that have stepped forward.
[00:14:39.866 --> 00:14:40.886]  So the cops run over.
[00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:41.727]  He's got his hands up.
[00:14:41.787 --> 00:14:45.749]  He leans back from the police officer because they don't know somebody was videotaping across the street.
[00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:55.699]  Now, the cop had said that he'd assaulted him and stuff, but once that video came out, they said, well, he spit on us, because they knew the video was shot at about 100 yards away.
[00:14:55.719 --> 00:14:58.421]  So he couldn't tell if he was spitting or not.
[00:14:58.441 --> 00:14:59.842]  So, oh, he spit on me.
[00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:03.846]  And now, of course, there's the cop car pulled up right there.
[00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:07.849]  The veteran saying, release the video.
[00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.672]  And Arne Seveda, the police chief, says, no, I'm not going to.
[00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:14.395]  And it's always the same, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:22.856]  In Houston, they pulled over that former CIA section chief, Carnaby, who was reportedly a whistleblower.
[00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:25.999]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, went down to Houston to investigate it.
[00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:29.261]  And the guy certainly was CIA on record, had all these awards.
[00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.703]  The media spun it and said he's not even CIA.
[00:15:31.983 --> 00:15:36.527]  But they get him out of the car, he doesn't resist, he's standing there, and the cops execute him.
[00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:37.988]  And you know what?
[00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:39.629]  They won't release the squad car videos.
[00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.772]  They got the helicopter shot of him clear as day executing him.
[00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:47.508]  He was on the run, I guess.
[00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:50.349]  Knew something he wasn't supposed to know.
[00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:54.330]  But they've got, especially on big departments like Houston, L.A.
[00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.232]  was the first to do it on record back in the 60s.
[00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:00.713]  They have hit teams in every police department.
[00:16:01.313 --> 00:16:02.514]  Actual hit teams.
[00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:06.395]  And a lot of times it's a quasi-mafia, but it's government approved.
[00:16:07.316 --> 00:16:12.278]  And when the gangs get out on line or somebody doesn't pay them their cut, they just send cops to kill you.
[00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:14.339]  They're called the Vikings.
[00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:20.081]  I've actually met some of them, you know, retired detectives, in Los Angeles.
[00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:21.482]  They just can do whatever they want.
[00:16:23.422 --> 00:16:24.803]  Police gangs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:25.303 --> 00:16:25.943]  The Vikings.
[00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:26.604]  Look them up.
[00:16:27.324 --> 00:16:32.366]  There have been famous incidents of them executing people and doing a lot of things.
[00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:37.108]  And sometimes there's sub-gangs of cops, but then they always shut those down.
[00:16:37.128 --> 00:16:37.168]  So,
[00:16:40.904 --> 00:16:46.369]  I don't know if they have hit teams on the Austin Police Department, and a lot of times they're unsanctioned, they're compartmentalized.
[00:16:47.010 --> 00:17:00.624]  It's admitted that all over the country the CIA is now involved with police departments and the threat fusion centers and recruiting, but they could just pull me over, or I go to the wrong town where they've got their guys, they could pull me over, shoot me, and just say, you know what, we're not releasing the squad car video.
[00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:02.106]  National security.
[00:17:03.646 --> 00:17:04.526]  They can say whatever they want.
[00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:06.667]  They can have me get on my knees, shoot me right in the back of the head.
[00:17:06.887 --> 00:17:07.667]  They can do it to you.
[00:17:08.447 --> 00:17:09.328]  They did it to Carnaby.
[00:17:09.808 --> 00:17:11.008]  Get out of the car, he gets out.
[00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:11.748]  Boom!
[00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:12.269]  You're dead.
[00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:15.790]  Oops, helicopter caught that, went out live.
[00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:16.910]  Doesn't matter.
[00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.611]  You want close-up video?
[00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:19.571]  We're not gonna release that.
[00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:29.534]  You know, I love how they always talk about the veterans, the system does, about how much they love them, how much they care about them, how great they are.
[00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:32.615]  But I've got an article here.
[00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:37.648]  Police get help with confronting veterans.
[00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:39.269]  Officer.com.
[00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:43.572]  And, uh, yeah, they're training for their number one enemy.
[00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:45.134]  Returning military.
[00:17:48.717 --> 00:17:56.083]  Oh, because these are people you just can't bully all day that'll actually break and respond.
[00:17:56.123 --> 00:17:57.804]  And the article actually says that more and more.
[00:17:58.324 --> 00:18:01.047]  The number one thing killing SWAT team members and others is
[00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:03.182]  Trained military people.
[00:18:03.242 --> 00:18:07.664]  Yeah, they've actually been actually fighting men and people that are shooting back at them in some cases.
[00:18:08.024 --> 00:18:11.845]  It's not just raiding drug dealers that didn't pay their cut to you or whatever.
[00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:17.967]  And there are people that have already killed so many people and feel bad about it that they're ready to die.
[00:18:18.387 --> 00:18:21.328]  And so they're ready to sell their life for a bunch of you guys.
[00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:28.092]  What do you think is going to happen as they try the gun confiscation they're training the military and police for?
[00:18:28.532 --> 00:18:34.475]  What do you think is going to happen when 1% of the 10 million plus veterans fight back against you?
[00:18:36.196 --> 00:18:37.117]  Total devastation.
[00:18:37.877 --> 00:18:38.698]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:41.099]  Nothing the system can do.
[00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:43.841]  No amount of robots, drones, nothing will help you.
[00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:48.730]  And of course, the globalists have all this set up by design.
[00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:59.121]  They think they're going to have some cutesy civil war, and out of this problem, reaction, solution, everything will break down and then later we'll beg for total tyranny.
[00:18:59.921 --> 00:19:01.002]  I don't see that happening.
[00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:07.789]  And what's really creepy is in every place in the United States, every major city,
[00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:09.152]  We're good to go.
[00:19:32.864 --> 00:19:40.086]  The point is, the criminals that have hijacked our government are training for absolute war against Americans.
[00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:43.267]  Now I'm going to go through a bunch of news when we get back.
[00:19:43.907 --> 00:19:46.268]  Thailand backs Twitter censorship policy.
[00:19:47.188 --> 00:19:48.849]  This is all part of the new treaty.
[00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.110]  Internet censorship, past and present.
[00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.050]  ACTA is worse than SOPA.
[00:19:55.391 --> 00:19:57.111]  Here's what you need to know about the global treaty.
[00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:59.992]  We'll break that down and a lot more straight ahead.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.781]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:09.163]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:14.045]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:14.425 --> 00:20:14.825]  It's true.
[00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:17.486]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:20:17.726 --> 00:20:19.467]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:24.689]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:32.151]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:33.232]  And here's the best part.

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.622]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:50.122 --> 00:20:51.864]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:02.757 --> 00:21:03.978]  Have you ever seen a U.S.
[00:21:04.038 --> 00:21:07.521]  postage stamp featuring Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, or George Washington?

[00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:53.877]  But what about when the food runs out?
[00:22:53.917 --> 00:22:54.478]  What then?
[00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:11.173]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:08.439]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:22.628]  Aaron Dykes, one of our investigative reporters here and a frequent host of InfoWorks Nightly News, ran in during the break and he said, you know how you're talking about
[00:24:23.749 --> 00:24:25.650]  How the government runs organized crime?
[00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.631]  Well, yeah, it's on record in so many testimonies in Congress, history.
[00:24:31.111 --> 00:24:36.193]  He said, don't forget Zbigniew Brzezinski, top globalist, think tank leader.
[00:24:37.673 --> 00:24:43.475]  His book, Between Two Ages, I remember this being on the bookshelf at my parents' house.
[00:24:44.315 --> 00:24:48.058]  This book with this cover, I didn't read it when I was a kid, I just remember that cover.
[00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:53.262]  Between Two Ages, America's Role in the Technotronic Era.
[00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:56.285]  You notice the globalists call themselves technocrats.
[00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:58.987]  Okay, they've planned all of this.
[00:24:59.087 --> 00:25:02.470]  They've designed the technology with Trojan horses to control.
[00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.191]  You think the technology has the use that you're using it for?
[00:25:06.251 --> 00:25:12.094]  That's only the bait on the hook to get you to use Google, to get you to use the cell phone.
[00:25:12.514 --> 00:25:14.615]  It's designed as a tracking and taxing grid.
[00:25:14.935 --> 00:25:16.255]  Listen to what Brzezinski says.
[00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:23.638]  This is a guy who also wrote a book two years ago bragging that they created Al-Qaeda and that the U.S.
[00:25:23.658 --> 00:25:24.919]  government funded Pol Pot.
[00:25:25.993 --> 00:25:28.935]  Oh, just type in Zbigniew Brzezinski poll pot quotes.
[00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:34.218]  And he's very proud that he helped finance them and they killed 30% of their population.
[00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:36.899]  That's why he's respected by globalists.
[00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:42.282]  The actual owners have awe at their master generals.
[00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:44.643]  Their technotronic, technocratic generals.
[00:25:45.164 --> 00:25:46.504]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski is one.
[00:25:48.245 --> 00:25:50.066]  So is Henry Kissinger.
[00:25:51.187 --> 00:25:52.267]  This is on page 6.
[00:25:55.137 --> 00:26:02.662]  A characteristic feature of concentrated humanity is the routinization of conflict.
[00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:10.927]  Direct violence becomes increasingly regulated and restricted and ultimately comes to be considered as a deviation from the norm.
[00:26:11.407 --> 00:26:18.852]  Organized mechanisms in the form of uniformed salaried personnel are established to confine violence to socially tolerable limits.
[00:26:19.372 --> 00:26:23.414]  A certain measure of crime is accepted as unavoidable for the sake of order.
[00:26:23.734 --> 00:26:34.059]  Therefore, organized crime is generally preferred to anarchic violence, thus indirectly and informally becoming an extension of order.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.421]  There you are, page six.
[00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:42.323]  In fact, zoom in on that, the document cam shot for folks that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:42.383 --> 00:26:42.443]  So,
[00:26:47.113 --> 00:26:48.154]  You need to understand.
[00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:59.323]  I remember some documents we've covered came out in the 70s in Chicago that what we already knew was going on, that the police departments were regulating the crime and certifying different organized crime syndicates.
[00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:01.585]  Well, I mean, that's already known.
[00:27:04.367 --> 00:27:05.888]  Remember what happened.
[00:27:05.908 --> 00:27:10.552]  And there's so many examples of this.
[00:27:12.092 --> 00:27:19.613]  But remember J. Edgar Hoover, in the early 1950s, in testimony to Congress, saying there's no such thing as organized crime.
[00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:24.894]  That it is a figment of crime reporters' imagination.
[00:27:27.455 --> 00:27:29.055]  Basically, they were conspiracy theorists.
[00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:30.875]  Now, why was that?
[00:27:32.976 --> 00:27:41.137]  Because J. Edgar Hoover, on record, lived a lifestyle of an incredibly rich person.
[00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:44.592]  J. Edgar Hoover was being paid off.
[00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:46.253]  J. Edgar Hoover was incredibly corrupt.
[00:27:47.994 --> 00:28:00.020]  The G-Men were only there to shut down small syndicates that were involved in prohibition running liquor that weren't paying their cut.
[00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:02.802]  And if you go to Hot Springs, Arkansas,
[00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:09.006]  Which became the main hub of creating Everclear or Moonshine to be shipped all over the United States.
[00:28:09.726 --> 00:28:13.609]  At their little museums there in the city, the tour guides on record.
[00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.093]  And the books that they sell from the little historical society, it's all.
[00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:22.836]  The Rockefellers were there, the Capones, all of them.
[00:28:23.077 --> 00:28:29.842]  And the elite would all come there to get treated for syphilis and other things that they had from all their sexual activity.
[00:28:31.004 --> 00:28:37.405]  But that they would produce the liquor there and then ship it by train all over the United States and that the U.S.
[00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:38.305]  government was involved.
[00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:51.248]  But of course J. Edgar Hoover in the 1950s could sit there and tell the childlike public there is no such thing as organized crime.
[00:28:51.628 --> 00:28:53.809]  Now you hear that today and you're like, well that's ridiculous.
[00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:55.049]  Everybody knows there's organized crime.
[00:28:56.689 --> 00:28:56.969]  Really?
[00:28:58.389 --> 00:29:00.550]  Hollywood teaches you that it's only the Italians.
[00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.074]  Or the Mexican Mafia.
[00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:04.698]  Or, you know, some Russian mob.
[00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:07.585]  No, really, the Russian Mafia is the NKVD.
[00:29:09.124 --> 00:29:15.106]  That the whole GRU, KGB apparatus that never went away.
[00:29:15.586 --> 00:29:15.986]  FSB.
[00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:18.167]  You can go look up the connections to that.
[00:29:18.687 --> 00:29:24.108]  Organized crime is only the black arm, the black op arm of government.
[00:29:24.369 --> 00:29:27.489]  Government itself a black op arm of the mega banks.
[00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.251]  So, the child kidnapping rings, the drug dealing, all of it.
[00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:35.188]  All of it is banker run.
[00:29:35.268 --> 00:29:36.389]  Our country's everything.
[00:29:36.469 --> 00:29:37.310]  Grow up, folks!
[00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:42.935]  When the troops got mad about being told to grow the opium, the government just went public that they're growing the opium.
[00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:45.457]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:48.179]  When a cop pulls you over and wants to search your car for drugs.
[00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:50.120]  He knows full well his bosses ship it all in.
[00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:52.282]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.782 --> 00:29:54.384]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.304 --> 00:29:57.987]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:04.793]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:05.013 --> 00:30:10.038]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:10.318 --> 00:30:11.679]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:20.648]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:28.474]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:36.519]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:41.842]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:30:42.142 --> 00:30:44.303]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:47.085 --> 00:30:50.008]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:03.252]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:08.638]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:13.523]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:13.903 --> 00:31:14.304]  It's true.
[00:31:14.384 --> 00:31:18.949]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:24.172]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:24.693 --> 00:31:26.614]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:27.014 --> 00:31:31.617]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:31.817 --> 00:31:32.718]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:32.938 --> 00:31:35.700]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.302]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:39.623 --> 00:31:42.465]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:42.805 --> 00:31:44.706]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:45.026 --> 00:31:45.947]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:49.589 --> 00:31:51.371]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:52.552 --> 00:31:58.337]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:58.657 --> 00:32:01.119]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:17.052]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:18.075 --> 00:32:21.776]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:22.757 --> 00:32:34.761]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:35.521 --> 00:32:42.784]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:43.484 --> 00:32:53.071]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:53.852 --> 00:32:57.134]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:57.774 --> 00:33:00.897]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:34.690]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.510]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.070]  Central.
[00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:37.411]  We're here.
[00:33:38.651 --> 00:33:40.472]  Five nights a week, seven o'clock Central.
[00:33:40.532 --> 00:33:43.793]  InfoWars Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:46.454 --> 00:33:47.974]  Let me try to be a little more disciplined.
[00:33:47.994 --> 00:33:51.075]  Let me attempt, because I've only probably got 200 articles here in front of me.
[00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:53.476]  Every one of them I could spend three hours on.
[00:33:55.277 --> 00:34:01.639]  Here's CBS News out of Hercules.
[00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:05.625]  Where is Hercules?
[00:34:06.886 --> 00:34:10.947]  It says the Lupine Hills Elementary School in Hercules.
[00:34:11.047 --> 00:34:17.268]  In fact, I had this last night and didn't cover it because I meant to go do a search and find out where Hercules is first.
[00:34:17.888 --> 00:34:20.029]  I guess it's outside San Francisco?
[00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.990]  That's what it looks like.
[00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.510]  Yeah, it is.
[00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:32.572]  A East Bay dad claims a game of tag on the playground resulted in his six-year-old son being accused of sexual assault.
[00:34:33.655 --> 00:34:44.242]  And the school that goes on says that touching someone on the leg is sexual assault, and he's now going to be listed as basically a sexual offender, and has been put in a database.
[00:34:45.223 --> 00:34:57.271]  Yeah, I see this all the time in the news, and they've got a local magazine called Busted, a weekly newspaper that comes out, and sometimes I'll buy it and look through it, mainly it's DWI, sometimes you see
[00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:01.525]  You know, urinating in public, sexual indecency.
[00:35:02.246 --> 00:35:15.836]  And I see the reports where people pull off on the highway now, in the middle of nowhere, like we all did growing up, and you go in the bushes and the cops pull up and run over and say, what were you doing?
[00:35:15.856 --> 00:35:22.501]  And if you're honest, they go over and get samples and everything, put you in handcuffs and take you to jail, because they've been ordered to.
[00:35:24.392 --> 00:35:37.335]  And when I was up at Bilderberg 2006 in Ottawa, Canada, in the suburb of it, the hotel was built out in a kind of defense contractor complex with like lakes and ponds and geese everywhere.
[00:35:37.355 --> 00:35:43.216]  It was well out, it was like 20 miles outside Ottawa or 15 miles outside.
[00:35:43.536 --> 00:35:46.397]  So it was big hotels and golf courses built in the countryside.
[00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:56.040]  And all there was was this hotel, and then, you know, a half mile away, a defense contractor building with barbed wire fences, so there was nowhere to go to the bathroom.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:05.082]  And the cops were all ordered, sometimes more than 20 of them, so it was about 10 squad cars at any one time, to be parked all around there.
[00:36:06.022 --> 00:36:12.884]  And I guess they didn't want to go through all the security procedures to go in to the Brooksfield Hotel.
[00:36:14.383 --> 00:36:14.503]  I'm
[00:36:39.011 --> 00:36:40.292]  He goes, yeah, I've heard that.
[00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:42.194]  I go, but I see you guys going over there.
[00:36:42.214 --> 00:36:43.295]  And he goes, well, what are we supposed to do?
[00:36:43.315 --> 00:36:43.996]  And I go, exactly.
[00:36:44.337 --> 00:36:45.838]  So are you going to arrest us for going over there?
[00:36:45.858 --> 00:36:46.499]  And he goes, no.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.541]  That's ridiculous.
[00:36:49.202 --> 00:36:52.445]  See, I mean, and America is so sick.
[00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:55.348]  I mean, I hear about all the time.
[00:36:55.488 --> 00:37:01.855]  I know business people and others who've been in National Forest.
[00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:07.611]  Urinating up against a tree and the ranger comes over and handcuffs him.
[00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:13.975]  I mean, we're being turned into totally domesticated creatures that live in a false environment.
[00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:17.898]  I said I'd discipline myself and cover 200 articles.
[00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:19.218]  Of course, you know it's not going to happen.
[00:37:20.379 --> 00:37:26.183]  Here is this CBS news out of Hercules, a suburb of San Francisco.
[00:37:28.944 --> 00:37:32.026]  And going back over a decade ago, they first banned dodgeball.
[00:37:32.426 --> 00:37:33.287]  Everybody's favorite game.
[00:37:36.383 --> 00:37:41.304]  Then they banned tag, and they banned wrestling, and then they banned touching.
[00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:43.365]  Guys, people won't believe this.
[00:37:43.425 --> 00:37:46.626]  Search, running at recess banned.
[00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:50.227]  I mean, there'll be hundreds of articles.
[00:37:50.307 --> 00:37:54.588]  And running is now, could be dangerous.
[00:37:54.608 --> 00:37:55.549]  You could fall down.
[00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:56.609]  You could skin your knee.
[00:38:00.714 --> 00:38:08.996]  And so they're banning running, and they were playing tag, and this child reportedly touched the other on the leg, tackling them.
[00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:13.858]  I mean, what now if a coach slaps you on the back?
[00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:14.918]  Good job, you know.
[00:38:15.818 --> 00:38:17.479]  Oh, sexual assault, take him to jail.
[00:38:18.739 --> 00:38:23.941]  Meanwhile, Dinecore and Halliburton are in the Chicago Tribune, Associated Press, this is five years ago.
[00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:42.668]  But hundreds of articles you can pull up where they're on record with C-130s and women and children they've grabbed at gunpoint, loading them up and the UN does it, flying them to Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Israel, where they're actual sex slaves and sometimes they snuff film them.
[00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:44.530]  This came out on Italian TV.
[00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:52.074]  They actually, this was Russian connected gangsters that were doing that, blowing the children's heads off.
[00:38:52.918 --> 00:38:57.559]  And they were selling the videos to Hollywood rich people.
[00:38:57.579 --> 00:38:59.559]  It came out in a few articles in the U.S.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.000]  They were selling the videos for as much as they reported for $50,000 per VHS.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.821]  This was like five, six years ago.
[00:39:07.821 --> 00:39:15.483]  VHS tapes of, I'm not going to even say what the Italian news, the Italian news blurred it and played it on national TV, and they actually got fired for it.
[00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:22.384]  But it was two-year-olds being raped and then having their heads blown off with revolvers.
[00:39:23.464 --> 00:39:24.644]  This is the type of stuff.
[00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:29.225]  So again, in this criminal... Yeah, there's Town Hall.
[00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:30.165]  Running at recess.
[00:39:30.245 --> 00:39:30.586]  Banned.
[00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:36.867]  They banned running at recess.
[00:39:38.407 --> 00:39:39.727]  And the police arrest you.
[00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:40.448]  There you go.
[00:39:41.268 --> 00:39:41.848]  Town Hall.
[00:39:41.988 --> 00:39:42.528]  George Will.
[00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:44.708]  The police arrest you.
[00:39:46.129 --> 00:39:49.870]  So the police arrest you for running or for playing tag.
[00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.850]  Arrest you.
[00:39:53.436 --> 00:40:02.423]  But the Fortune 100 defense contractors, the UN, just type in UN sexual abuse, UN raping children.
[00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:04.044]  I mean, it's every day it's in the news.
[00:40:04.824 --> 00:40:16.713]  These are brigades of pedophile sickos who love getting paid near minimum wage and stomping around in the worst cesspits in the world because they can kill and murder whoever they want.
[00:40:17.213 --> 00:40:23.016]  It is hunting, raping, killing, slaughtering, raping women, full-grown men, children.
[00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:29.419]  You can type into the search engine, UN troops barbecuing children, UN troops raping.
[00:40:29.559 --> 00:40:30.459]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.440]  Newspaper articles, all of it.
[00:40:33.501 --> 00:40:35.942]  I mean, just, it is a hell force.
[00:40:37.963 --> 00:40:40.804]  UN troops in South Sudan raping children, Daily Telegraph.
[00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:43.125]  That was from when?
[00:40:47.759 --> 00:40:48.480]  Yeah, that's 2007.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.342]  But again, I mean, it's just unlimited.
[00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.544]  That's just the first thing they pulled up.
[00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.047]  So this is how the criminals operate.
[00:41:01.351 --> 00:41:06.914]  The opium is publicly grown by our troops and loaded on C-130s and shipped into Europe and the United States.
[00:41:07.874 --> 00:41:11.896]  Pat Tillman wrote letters home saying he was going to come back and talk about it, so they just murdered him.
[00:41:12.316 --> 00:41:18.619]  You're talking about $500 bill just in opium out of there, another $500 bill, same number, in total drugs brought into the U.S.
[00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:19.079]  every year.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.141]  There's BBC, peacekeepers abusing children.
[00:41:24.517 --> 00:41:45.183]  They're loading them on C-130s, the highest dollar ones are Southern and Eastern and Western European children, and they're engaged in every evil under the sun publicly, but all these Hollywood people who are concerned about sex trafficking, that's the big trendy thing now, the system always takes over
[00:41:46.806 --> 00:42:05.774]  The fight against breast cancer, the fight against children being kidnapped, the fight against any abuse that's going on so they can control the debate and control the advocacy and then collect money from the public that they actually use to shut down cowboy grassroots traffickers in drugs, in organs, in diamonds, in children.
[00:42:07.054 --> 00:42:08.715]  These are models that are used.
[00:42:09.295 --> 00:42:12.717]  And they have movies against the blood diamonds, which is really
[00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:14.601]  Now there it is.
[00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:16.762]  Aid workers raping children.
[00:42:17.143 --> 00:42:19.684]  Major charities running child kidnapping rings.
[00:42:23.086 --> 00:42:23.766]  That's good, guys.
[00:42:23.846 --> 00:42:29.069]  I mean, people can go find it for themselves, because every time they put the articles on screen, I kind of turn and start reading them on air.
[00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:35.613]  It's an unlimited, bottomless black pit directly into the vortex of hell.
[00:42:37.162 --> 00:42:42.104]  With unlimited criminal government, rendition flights, torture, torturing children.
[00:42:42.384 --> 00:42:45.745]  Why do you think at every one of the torture bases in Iraq, the Army's own reports?
[00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:52.708]  Just type in Army Report on Torture and Abuse at Abu Ghraib and you will get the big PDF.
[00:42:52.808 --> 00:42:53.808]  Read the hundreds of pages.
[00:42:56.509 --> 00:43:00.011]  The phosphoric acid on the children, all of it.
[00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:03.212]  I mean, this is, this is dungeon keeper
[00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:11.910]  Jeffrey Dahmer, beyond anything you can imagine.
[00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.730]  And why do you think it goes on everywhere?
[00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.751]  Because it's what they like to do.
[00:43:18.132 --> 00:43:21.673]  And they sell you on torture like it's a good thing.
[00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:24.360]  To get the bad guys to keep you safe.
[00:43:24.761 --> 00:43:32.106]  When in truth, this is a society of psychos and pit demons who want to openly do what they do safely.
[00:43:32.487 --> 00:43:35.329]  Because they want the big bonanza America and Europe.
[00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:37.290]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:40.373]  They want to do here what they've done all over the world.
[00:43:43.035 --> 00:43:47.038]  Now, this is how it works.
[00:43:47.779 --> 00:43:48.779]  They publicly
[00:43:49.787 --> 00:43:54.070]  In the 80s and 90s, got caught shipping cocaine in and still run it all in and still constantly get caught.
[00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.831]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:55.411]  The government does.
[00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:57.512]  And select corporations and the banks that launder it.
[00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.014]  They're bringing in the opium.
[00:43:59.114 --> 00:43:59.454]  All of it.
[00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:06.419]  And when they get caught, their new thing, I know I marvel every day about this, is to think about this.
[00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:14.945]  Have Fox, CNN, MSNBC, BBC, ABC News, all make excuses that the troops help grow the opium.
[00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:18.187]  Because if they don't, the Al-Qaeda will and they'll get the money.
[00:44:19.889 --> 00:44:23.931]  That's what Brzezinski says in his book, Between Two Ages, written back in the 70s.
[00:44:23.971 --> 00:44:26.093]  Let me give you the actual publishing date.
[00:44:26.113 --> 00:44:27.774]  I'm going from memory that it was written in the 70s.
[00:44:29.035 --> 00:44:30.295]  I did read this when I was in college.
[00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:30.455]  Yeah, 1970.
[00:44:33.191 --> 00:44:37.796]  He says the governments of the world control organized crime because that makes it manageable.
[00:44:38.136 --> 00:44:39.818]  That's how they sell the excuse.
[00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:41.579]  Makes it manageable?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:50.969]  Grabbing kids off playgrounds and putting them on C-130s to take them so Saudi Arabian royalty can rape them and blow their heads off if they feel like it?
[00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.391]  No, the government
[00:44:54.369 --> 00:45:02.394]  has raced to the bottom and is purely satanic and demonic and filthy serial killing, murdering demons.
[00:45:03.115 --> 00:45:04.136]  None of us are safe.
[00:45:04.656 --> 00:45:06.157]  Hell has been released, okay?
[00:45:06.397 --> 00:45:07.378]  It's already going on.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.641]  The New World Order isn't coming.
[00:45:12.081 --> 00:45:13.062]  It's already here.
[00:45:14.903 --> 00:45:23.809]  Everybody gets upset when the troops shoot dogs or blow people's sheep up in Afghanistan or Iraq for fun, or torture a puppy on video, because we haven't been taught
[00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:29.112]  We haven't seen simulated murders of dogs millions of times on TV.
[00:45:29.632 --> 00:45:33.034]  We've seen simulated murders of humans, where we see it as entertainment now.
[00:45:33.294 --> 00:45:34.335]  We've lost our humanity.
[00:45:34.615 --> 00:45:41.360]  But through animals, and all these groups wanting to protect animals, which I think is fine, we can find our humanity.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.981]  What about children?
[00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:48.765]  What about a three-year-old, a five-year-old, grabbed out of their backyard, grabbed out of the public school?
[00:45:49.406 --> 00:45:53.609]  Where a lot of times they have CPS come in and shop for the kids they want, and the kid just disappears.
[00:45:54.269 --> 00:45:59.691]  Remember six, seven years ago, CNN was reporting thousands of children missing that CPS had taken.
[00:45:59.711 --> 00:46:02.612]  They were finding them buried and dead in foreign countries.
[00:46:02.972 --> 00:46:08.374]  And then that politically went to the top of the CPS, where the entire leadership were convicted pedophiles.
[00:46:08.654 --> 00:46:10.335]  And then the story stopped right there.
[00:46:12.475 --> 00:46:14.216]  It stopped because it went too high.
[00:46:16.617 --> 00:46:18.617]  See, there's not complete control of the media yet.
[00:46:18.817 --> 00:46:20.638]  There's still reporters that want to get the truth out.
[00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.919]  But when they find out just how bad it is,
[00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:29.212]  When it breaks through to the other side, that's why I say I've seen reality.
[00:46:29.592 --> 00:46:34.174]  I've really studied what's going on, and it's so totally hellish.
[00:46:36.314 --> 00:46:37.495]  All you can do is resist it.
[00:46:37.915 --> 00:46:40.656]  There is not a discussion about backing off.
[00:46:40.676 --> 00:46:44.498]  A lot of people hear me talk about these horrid things, and they say, well, we better shut up.
[00:46:44.558 --> 00:46:45.658]  We better go along with this.
[00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:46.758]  These people sound really evil.
[00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.720]  Don't you get it, folks?
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.960]  That's how they win.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.921]  That's why they've been winning.
[00:46:53.737 --> 00:47:01.885]  Because what they do is so horrible, people are intimidated, people can't believe the scope of it, you come face to face with something so horrible.
[00:47:02.745 --> 00:47:06.826]  So totally evil that you can't believe it.
[00:47:07.086 --> 00:47:16.689]  How many times in criminology have you read where the neighbor seems so nice, so friendly, drives a nice car, business suit, and they dig up 30 bodies in the backyard.
[00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.911]  And then there's videos, you know, and photos the person has of them torturing people.
[00:47:21.191 --> 00:47:23.111]  And the neighbors are like, I had coffee with him.
[00:47:23.151 --> 00:47:24.392]  He took care of my son.
[00:47:24.812 --> 00:47:25.912]  He watered our plants.
[00:47:26.012 --> 00:47:27.093]  I knew him for 20 years.
[00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:28.213]  I can't believe it.
[00:47:29.133 --> 00:47:31.054]  You better believe it.
[00:47:32.301 --> 00:47:34.622]  You better believe it real good!
[00:47:34.642 --> 00:47:41.566]  Because I'm going to say it again, and finally it's starting to get into the news, and I want to think that we're actually getting some of this going.
[00:47:41.846 --> 00:47:42.887]  Here's the London Independent.
[00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.009]  Research into mutant flu must go on.
[00:47:46.749 --> 00:47:47.970]  Scientists dismiss U.S.
[00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.433]  group's fear of the creation of airborne H5N1 virus could inspire bioterrorism.
[00:47:52.973 --> 00:47:54.414]  As if it's going to inspire it!
[00:47:55.094 --> 00:47:55.895]  They've made it!
[00:47:56.576 --> 00:48:02.163]  They've made mousepox, Ebola, airborne, that kills in every case, depending on what pathogen, 91, 92, 93, 94.
[00:48:02.283 --> 00:48:03.185]  Some of these kill.
[00:48:03.205 --> 00:48:05.007]  99% of the target mammalian species they're made for.
[00:48:13.407 --> 00:48:14.567]  I know I keep harping on this.
[00:48:15.187 --> 00:48:19.548]  I mean, the police are arresting people that run at recess all over the United States.
[00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:21.288]  You see, you think I exaggerate?
[00:48:21.508 --> 00:48:24.249]  I said pull up articles about them banning running.
[00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:27.790]  They pull up a bunch of articles where they're arresting five-year-olds for running.
[00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.490]  Or they're arresting seven-year-olds for tag.
[00:48:33.751 --> 00:48:41.592]  Where this is going on, meanwhile, they're grabbing children worldwide, raping them, and then chopping their heads off, blowing their heads off on video.
[00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.971]  And I'll never forget, I walked out of P.F.
[00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:53.095]  Chang's about three, four years ago, and there were a whole bunch of cops that had been in there eating in uniform.
[00:48:53.376 --> 00:48:54.596]  They were all laughing and stuff.
[00:48:55.617 --> 00:48:56.918]  And I said, hey, how are you guys doing?
[00:48:56.938 --> 00:48:58.039]  They go, oh, Alex Jones.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.922]  And of course, these were senior guys, all arrogant, drunk on their power.
[00:49:02.942 --> 00:49:05.063]  Because lower-level cops always seem to be better.
[00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:07.685]  And I'm like, hey, that's the DynCorp building right there.
[00:49:08.546 --> 00:49:09.507]  They got a new name for it.
[00:49:09.527 --> 00:49:11.708]  I said, you know what they are?
[00:49:11.728 --> 00:49:14.130]  And they looked at it and said, yeah, we work there.
[00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:16.718]  I said, you know about the big sex scandals?
[00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:18.880]  Child kidnapping worldwide.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.502]  They went, oh, yeah, we do.
[00:49:22.183 --> 00:49:23.985]  It's just like, man, you guys think you're safe?
[00:49:24.465 --> 00:49:25.506]  You think that's funny?
[00:49:25.826 --> 00:49:30.830]  You just signed on spiritually to what those people did.
[00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:38.457]  I mean, I literally spiritually could just see the demons coiling around them and slithering around those cop souls.
[00:49:39.827 --> 00:49:56.894]  I'm not saying I physically saw it, I'm just saying in the image in my mind, I just, I was just like, well, I mean, I feel so sorry for those childlike, arrested development, cowardly vessels of demonic filth, begging to be delivered into hell.
[00:49:57.414 --> 00:50:00.115]  And don't worry, you're not going to have to wait until you die to be delivered into hell.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.243]  It was funny to them when responsibility showed up and talked to them.
[00:50:07.523 --> 00:50:12.766]  When one of the scum, who usually are afraid of them and scurry in fear from them, said something to them.
[00:50:14.487 --> 00:50:15.768]  I wanted to see what they'd say.
[00:50:15.788 --> 00:50:22.151]  You know what, they looked at me and a couple of them acted thrilled and empowered and said, yeah, we work for them.
[00:50:22.772 --> 00:50:24.092]  And had twinkles in their eyes.
[00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:30.096]  You just signed on, pal.
[00:50:31.072 --> 00:50:32.133]  You're now an accomplice.
[00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:35.858]  It's not about the letter of the law, it's about the spirit of the law.
[00:50:35.898 --> 00:50:38.081]  You ought to hit your knees and repent to God.
[00:50:38.682 --> 00:50:45.711]  I can't imagine the type of karma, reap what you sow, bad luck, whatever you want to call it, that that brings on you.
[00:50:47.573 --> 00:50:48.935]  To make jokes about that.
[00:50:52.657 --> 00:50:55.640]  You know, if you thought I was a liar, you should have gotten my face and told me that.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.781]  No, but you know I'm not.
[00:50:57.242 --> 00:50:58.803]  You just made a joke about it.
[00:50:59.524 --> 00:51:02.267]  You just think about those little kids, tied up, begging for their lives.
[00:51:02.467 --> 00:51:03.628]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:03.849 --> 00:51:14.319]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.400]  InfoWars.com
[00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:18.643]  He's leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:51:18.983 --> 00:51:21.425]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:51:21.725 --> 00:51:32.512]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:51:32.992 --> 00:51:36.314]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:51:36.475 --> 00:51:42.119]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:42.619 --> 00:51:52.126]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:52.526 --> 00:51:53.707]  The war is here.
[00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.348]  It's an info war.
[00:51:55.368 --> 00:51:56.709]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:52:02.304 --> 00:52:07.327]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:25.259 --> 00:52:30.921]  Cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[00:53:05.236 --> 00:53:09.959]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:12.140]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.462]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:53:15.802 --> 00:53:22.986]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:27.489]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:33.512]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:53:33.852 --> 00:53:35.433]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:53:35.654 --> 00:53:41.658]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:53:51.286 --> 00:53:56.750]  Call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.953]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:08.995]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:54:11.116 --> 00:54:17.257]  More and more you notice I get to some of the news, but not a lot of it, because everything is connected.
[00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:25.340]  You know, I read an article about being charged with sexual assault, you know, if you're seven years old or whatever, because you played tag and touched somebody on the leg.
[00:54:29.736 --> 00:54:32.617]  Or how kids are being arrested, period, as young as five.
[00:54:32.637 --> 00:54:35.798]  Oh, this is a six-year-old with a sexual assault, yeah.
[00:54:36.878 --> 00:54:39.039]  As young as five being arrested just for running.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.141]  USA Today, Town Hall, all reporting it with straight faces.
[00:54:45.501 --> 00:54:47.422]  Like, should we be arresting five-year-olds?
[00:54:48.843 --> 00:54:51.203]  That's like saying, should we be shooting ourselves in the head?
[00:54:51.223 --> 00:54:51.263]  No!
[00:54:54.397 --> 00:54:56.057]  But it's all about control mechanisms.
[00:54:56.077 --> 00:54:58.038]  It's about making the general public criminals.
[00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:04.960]  That's why I get so mad when a cop pulls me over and starts asking me what's in my car and asking me if I have drugs.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.600]  I'm like, are you kidding?
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:12.962]  Even if I did, which I don't, any moron knows the drugs are shipped in by the government!
[00:55:15.423 --> 00:55:18.804]  And then you want to bust me with some to put me in prison?
[00:55:21.704 --> 00:55:23.826]  I mean, I don't even eat your MSG.
[00:55:24.106 --> 00:55:26.108]  By the way, you know the type of drugs they put in our food?
[00:55:26.128 --> 00:55:28.670]  Have you read those additives?
[00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:34.836]  Every one of those pharmacological additives is just a drug that they got added as a food additive.
[00:55:36.937 --> 00:55:38.899]  Here's New Yorker Magazine, the caging of America.
[00:55:39.299 --> 00:55:40.701]  Why do we lock up so many people?
[00:55:41.718 --> 00:55:44.419]  And it goes on to report there's now six million people.
[00:55:45.059 --> 00:55:49.720]  Six million people are under correctional supervision in the U.S., more than were in Stalin's gulags.
[00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:51.621]  Yeah, no one has ever done that.
[00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:55.242]  By the way, all over the world, prison populations are skyrocketing.
[00:55:56.703 --> 00:56:01.424]  You know, you can't tell me the federal courts are real when they've been caught in all their fraud and they convict 98%.
[00:56:01.484 --> 00:56:02.264]  You think 98% are guilty?
[00:56:06.323 --> 00:56:08.744]  They only have that kind of conviction rate in North Korea and here.
[00:56:09.384 --> 00:56:14.086]  You can't tell me 6 million people in prison, and by the way, they're colleges of crime.
[00:56:14.747 --> 00:56:24.251]  You take somebody, and for a non-violent offense, you put them in jail, ruin their future of having a career, they're going to get out only knowing criminals, and they're going to become criminals.
[00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:26.592]  Which is what the system wants.
[00:56:27.212 --> 00:56:30.154]  They want to irrevocably destroy people's lives.
[00:56:30.434 --> 00:56:34.055]  This is a scorched earth, New World Order takeover system.
[00:56:34.656 --> 00:56:35.036]  Period.
[00:56:35.799 --> 00:56:37.801]  I want to get your take on this and more.
[00:56:37.821 --> 00:56:39.202]  800-259-9231.
[00:56:39.342 --> 00:56:43.546]  I got all the latest on Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.
[00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:44.807]  I'll get to it after some calls.
[00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:50.232]  Even rhinos cannot support Newt Gingrich.
[00:56:50.312 --> 00:56:51.994]  And I'm not saying that makes Mitt Romney good.
[00:56:52.014 --> 00:56:54.156]  It's just Gingrich, if it's possible, is even worse.
[00:56:55.317 --> 00:57:01.683]  And now Newt goes nuclear, Gingrich slams pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-tax increase moderate Mitt Romney.
[00:57:04.397 --> 00:57:07.560]  Well, I mean, that's basically what Newt's been in the past, but flip-flopped.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.181]  I mean, yeah!
[00:57:09.001 --> 00:57:12.825]  I mean, it's two globalists fighting with each other as if we've got to choose one of them.
[00:57:13.105 --> 00:57:16.989]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul is right in there with them, but the media never gives Ron Paul attention.
[00:57:17.229 --> 00:57:19.892]  They act like, they're always asking, when are you going to drop out?
[00:57:20.112 --> 00:57:25.577]  But the key is, more dirt's coming out on Gingrich, more's coming out on Romney, and as they destroy each other, Ron Paul moves up.
[00:57:26.218 --> 00:57:27.699]  Now there's election fraud involved.
[00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:30.461]  But we know we're not going to win if we don't come to the table and fight.
[00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:32.903]  We won't even be able to expose the fraud if we don't fight.
[00:57:33.243 --> 00:57:35.224]  At least Ron Paul's in there injecting real issues.
[00:57:38.307 --> 00:57:42.510]  Also coming up, I've been telling you this forever because it was in a British Ministry of Defense report, 2007.
[00:57:45.199 --> 00:57:46.620]  But now they're telling the general public.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:47.920]  UK riots.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.841]  Paratroopers are trained in riot control.
[00:57:50.242 --> 00:57:56.124]  British troops are being trained in riot control activities and fears that violence and looting will return to Britain's streets.
[00:57:57.665 --> 00:58:08.931]  Now, in the United States, the Army Times and all the other big publications are all stars and stripes, you name it, reporting that they're preparing for martial law.
[00:58:09.724 --> 00:58:15.167]  But then the National News attacks myself and Ron Paul for warning of this just because we actually read the Army Times.
[00:58:15.187 --> 00:58:17.388]  It's like, oh look, they say they're going to do this.
[00:58:18.209 --> 00:58:18.969]  Oh, you're crazy!
[00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:21.310]  Because see, they're not ready for you to know about this yet.
[00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:23.191]  So they communicate with each other.
[00:58:24.352 --> 00:58:27.694]  But then when someone actually reads it, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:58:29.055 --> 00:58:32.617]  And Kurt Nimmo got an article, British Army exercise to put down insurrection.
[00:58:33.157 --> 00:58:34.217]  You can see the drills here.
[00:58:34.237 --> 00:58:35.298]  I'm going to show you a photo of this.
[00:58:35.938 --> 00:58:36.499]  It's amazing.
[00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:44.691]  Gosh, look at that photo of them with the machine guns.
[00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:48.813]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:56.094]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:58:56.435 --> 00:58:58.317]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:58:58.717 --> 00:59:00.199]  If not yours, your neighbors.
[00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:03.102]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:59:03.542 --> 00:59:10.030]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:13.754]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:59:13.774 --> 00:59:18.680]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:59:18.981 --> 00:59:20.242]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:59:20.502 --> 00:59:21.564]  Your food supply.
[00:59:21.924 --> 00:59:25.789]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:29.754]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply.
[00:59:29.994 --> 00:59:30.254]  We're good.
[00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:56.993]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.453 --> 01:00:00.216]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.874 --> 01:00:11.057]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.717 --> 01:00:12.518]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:14.259]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.839 --> 01:00:18.462]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:23.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.203 --> 01:00:33.885]  Tonight I've been ranting and covering news in the first hour.
[01:00:33.905 --> 01:00:35.026]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:43.612]  Dr. Kathryn Albrecht on the global internet censorship grid that's going into place is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:43.652 --> 01:00:45.473]  We'll also take some calls in the second half of that.
[01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:47.495]  I do want to take your calls in this hour.
[01:00:47.915 --> 01:00:56.081]  There's a new article up at Infowars.com titled, Indy Super Bowl National Security State Protects Sports Fans from Prostitutes.
[01:00:56.581 --> 01:00:59.342]  We'll be telling you about that briefly after the break when we go to more calls.
[01:00:59.842 --> 01:01:05.283]  And it ties in with British Army exercises to put down insurrection.
[01:01:05.323 --> 01:01:09.664]  There's an amazing photo right here where it shows the British Army searching people.
[01:01:11.164 --> 01:01:14.325]  I'm getting ready to roll this out on a wider scale.
[01:01:15.345 --> 01:01:18.726]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[01:01:18.826 --> 01:01:20.907]  Sam in the UK, speaking of the UK.
[01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:21.667]  Hi, Sam.
[01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:23.447]  Hi.
[01:01:23.487 --> 01:01:25.568]  Can you hear me?
[01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:25.928]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:27.546 --> 01:01:28.526]  How's it going man?
[01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:32.448]  Long time listener, about three years now.
[01:01:33.769 --> 01:01:44.013]  As I'm speaking now I can feel my chest kind of, like my blood boil because every day it's, if it's not one thing it's the other thing and it's just on top of each other all the time.
[01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:46.954]  I had a little list I was going to talk about but
[01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:50.917]  I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a bit concerned about the internet.
[01:01:51.978 --> 01:01:59.905]  Obviously, without the internet, if there was no internet, I wouldn't have known about you, I wouldn't have known about your films, I wouldn't be a Prison Planet member or anything like that.
[01:02:01.106 --> 01:02:03.448]  If they do take it down, what do you think is the next step?
[01:02:03.468 --> 01:02:04.569]  What do you think we can do about it?
[01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:05.890]  Well, no.
[01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:11.234]  They're going to selectively start taking it down with these excuses they've got that don't have due process.
[01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:17.538]  Shutting down websites, shutting down content, banning individuals through a biometric internet ID.
[01:02:17.598 --> 01:02:18.219]  So that's the thing.
[01:02:18.439 --> 01:02:24.483]  People are like, oh, biometrics, all thumbprint to go to Disney World or to get in the gym or whatever.
[01:02:26.545 --> 01:02:30.547]  Then they can turn off your thumbprint and the place won't even accept your cash.
[01:02:31.508 --> 01:02:33.150]  This is what's globally going to be standardized.
[01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.652]  You've got a thumbprint even to use cash.
[01:02:35.772 --> 01:02:37.654]  Now they can stop you from buying and selling.
[01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:40.717]  Now they can add any taxes or fines or fees they want.
[01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:45.361]  They're now about to try to implement everything we've warned you about.
[01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:49.985]  All of this has just been the globalists getting a standardized New World Order in place.
[01:02:50.586 --> 01:02:53.769]  Now they're preparing to launch the whole thing on the people.
[01:02:54.309 --> 01:03:13.689]  And so they've gone from building it and beta testing it, to now just openly overthrowing the Bill of Rights Constitution, Magna Carta in the UK, and saying it's gone, admitting they're spying on you, taking your children for no reason, putting video cameras in the homes of people when they have kids, preemptively like they're criminals, beyond 1984, just total evil.
[01:03:17.153 --> 01:03:21.615]  Banning protesting in many cities in London and other areas, as you know.
[01:03:21.695 --> 01:03:22.716]  Tracking everybody.
[01:03:23.256 --> 01:03:30.780]  I mean, the crooks, the crooks, when they start shutting down the web, that's when they start arresting political dissidents.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.281]  That's when they'll kill me.
[01:03:32.781 --> 01:03:35.023]  That's when they'll start their garbage.
[01:03:35.543 --> 01:03:37.564]  And that's when people then have to defend themselves.
[01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:44.785]  I mean, you can't just let a bunch of total criminal scum come and take you and your family away and do God knows what with your children.
[01:03:45.265 --> 01:03:48.186]  I mean, these are people that think it's funny to kill kids, on average.
[01:03:48.526 --> 01:03:51.607]  I mean, they have sick demons working for them.
[01:03:51.907 --> 01:03:56.788]  They've gone through the police and the military and found the sick demons and promoted them.
[01:03:57.088 --> 01:04:02.709]  And we're facing unmitigated evil.
[01:04:02.729 --> 01:04:03.909]  I don't know how to describe it, sir.
[01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:08.882]  I mean, Alex, I mean, I was trying to say that to all the Americans.
[01:04:08.902 --> 01:04:09.883]  I've never been to America.
[01:04:09.903 --> 01:04:11.685]  I see it on TV.
[01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.247]  I think, yeah, one day I'm going to go down there.
[01:04:13.287 --> 01:04:18.051]  But I'm just going to say, like, you guys need to look after the Second Amendment.
[01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:24.017]  You need to make sure you look after that, because that is the one thing that's going to protect anything that you've got.
[01:04:24.037 --> 01:04:25.078]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:25.098 --> 01:04:26.159]  You've got to look after that.
[01:04:27.711 --> 01:04:28.191]  You're right.
[01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:31.732]  In fact, guys, I didn't see it printed from our article.
[01:04:31.812 --> 01:04:33.252]  I saw the Ammo Land story.
[01:04:33.272 --> 01:04:35.253]  Will you print me the Info Wars version?
[01:04:35.693 --> 01:04:42.234]  It'll be in the archives now of our article about New Jersey moves to ban all handgun ammo, most rifle ammo.
[01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:44.675]  God bless you from the UK, Sam.
[01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:45.255]  Anything else?
[01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:47.575]  That's it, man.
[01:04:47.595 --> 01:04:49.396]  Just take care of yourself and we've got your back.
[01:04:49.476 --> 01:04:50.636]  We're doing everything we can.
[01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.162]  Well, thank you.
[01:04:52.262 --> 01:04:55.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, we better use the internet while we've still got it.
[01:04:55.584 --> 01:04:56.484]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:04:56.504 --> 01:04:57.745]  I mean, this is not a game.
[01:04:58.706 --> 01:04:59.526]  This is not a game.
[01:05:02.668 --> 01:05:08.132]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:09.312 --> 01:05:14.075]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:14.455 --> 01:05:15.936]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:05:18.533 --> 01:05:21.258]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:23.182 --> 01:05:25.326]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:29.374]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:35.551]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:36.252 --> 01:05:39.373]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:40.093 --> 01:05:40.913]  Others don't.
[01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.214]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:44.975]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:45.255 --> 01:05:47.815]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:48.136 --> 01:05:54.398]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:56.979]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:57.459 --> 01:05:59.499]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.700]  Others don't.
[01:06:06.149 --> 01:06:07.030]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:10.912]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:11.273 --> 01:06:13.594]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:13.734 --> 01:06:18.998]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:25.703]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:26.123 --> 01:06:31.667]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:32.067 --> 01:06:35.770]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:40.233]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:40.534 --> 01:06:46.478]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:46.498 --> 01:06:49.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:51.462]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:52.022 --> 01:06:52.523]  It's here.

[01:07:04.586 --> 01:07:09.611]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:09.891 --> 01:07:11.252]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:20.221]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:28.047]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:28.487 --> 01:07:36.092]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:36.492 --> 01:07:41.415]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:08:16.178 --> 01:08:27.122]  A bunch of greedy, arrogant control freaks in all their little fancy business suits, commanding huge paramilitary armies, believe they can take down our society worldwide.
[01:08:28.303 --> 01:08:33.445]  They believe that they can install their enforcement of despotism against us.
[01:08:33.545 --> 01:08:33.745]  Well...
[01:08:34.505 --> 01:08:39.268]  They're a bunch of illegal criminals who have proven that by their actions and are illegitimate.
[01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:45.933]  And I declare independence against the transhumanist, eugenics, death cult known as the New World Order.
[01:08:46.373 --> 01:08:49.615]  You are illegitimate, criminal, degenerate scum.
[01:08:50.035 --> 01:08:53.818]  You are lawless trash and you are not my rulers.
[01:08:54.358 --> 01:08:59.021]  I am a sovereign American and people are sovereign worldwide as human beings.
[01:08:59.642 --> 01:09:01.223]  I'm not only a sovereign American,
[01:09:02.023 --> 01:09:09.325]  Because America is only based on the fact that the individual is sovereign, endowed by their creator, with unalienable rights.
[01:09:11.246 --> 01:09:13.787]  You can pass laws all day saying I'm your slave.
[01:09:14.147 --> 01:09:15.127]  I'm not scum!
[01:09:17.308 --> 01:09:24.810]  And have you noticed that as we lose our liberties and as our freedoms are flushed down the toilet, as the oxygen leaves the room, the prosperity leaves as well?
[01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.030]  That that's the thing!
[01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:28.431]  You want freedom!
[01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:37.116]  Anytime a system, a corporate system, a government system tries to get rid of basic freedoms, basic checks and balances, look out!
[01:09:38.097 --> 01:09:38.698]  Look out!
[01:09:38.818 --> 01:09:40.459]  And boy, is it look out time.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.881]  You think stuff's bad now?
[01:09:43.682 --> 01:09:45.183]  This is an engineered depression.
[01:09:47.985 --> 01:09:50.808]  I'm going to go to Jim, Wilson, Angie, and others.
[01:09:50.848 --> 01:09:53.270]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:09:59.264 --> 01:10:06.609]  And I want your view on the news, on Ron Paul, on military in Europe, the U.S., England, openly trying to take on the people now.
[01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:13.914]  They've gone from denying it to admitting it, saying they'll secretly arrest us, tasering and attacking peaceful demonstrators all over the country.
[01:10:14.235 --> 01:10:15.696]  Those videos are pouring in.
[01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:23.761]  An incredible piece of legislation out of New Jersey, and they've got similar ones in California and other areas.
[01:10:24.102 --> 01:10:28.505]  New Jersey bill aims to ban all handgun ammo, some rifle ammo.
[01:10:29.744 --> 01:10:30.725]  You think I'm joking?
[01:10:31.806 --> 01:10:35.090]  We have links to the NRA and Ammo Land on this, and we've read the bill.
[01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.393]  It also bans any alteration on a gun.
[01:10:38.013 --> 01:10:41.337]  You add some kind of sights, you do something, it's called defacing.
[01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:41.838]  It's illegal.
[01:10:42.799 --> 01:10:46.783]  In an end run around an all-out gun ban, the New Jersey Assembly
[01:10:48.021 --> 01:10:54.344]  of Law and Public Safety Committee is set to consider legislation that would ban ammunition under the auspices of protecting police.
[01:10:54.885 --> 01:11:01.188]  And you gotta love this idea that the police, if anything could, well cars could kill a cop, better ban those.
[01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:04.090]  The police on record said they don't have to protect us, it's not their job to.
[01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:06.171]  They're really there to enforce revenue collection.
[01:11:07.612 --> 01:11:13.655]  But then, and if they do protect you, it takes 10-15 minutes to get there, when they do do their job, or are allowed to.
[01:11:14.522 --> 01:11:18.444]  But you shouldn't be able to have a gun like Chicago or New York or England.
[01:11:19.604 --> 01:11:24.666]  But then, all they, but then they have guns to protect themselves.
[01:11:26.907 --> 01:11:36.350]  The language seemingly targets the already prohibited armor-piercing ammunition, but would encompass any ammo that is deemed to, quote, quote, pose a threat to the safety and well-being of law enforcement.
[01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:37.811]  And the well-being
[01:11:38.456 --> 01:11:42.159]  Here's another little juicy that just went up at Infowars.com and then I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:09.760]  Okay, continuing here.
[01:12:12.463 --> 01:12:13.704]  Indy Super Bowl.
[01:12:13.904 --> 01:12:19.510]  National security state protects sports fans from prostitutes.
[01:12:22.986 --> 01:12:23.866]  You just heard me right.
[01:12:24.186 --> 01:12:27.868]  Remember Aaron Dykes' article last week off Homeland Security press releases?
[01:12:28.368 --> 01:12:30.769]  Where they said, we are going to federalize your police.
[01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:32.130]  We're going to hire your police.
[01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:36.192]  We're going to have checkpoints, mobile trucks, body scanners, house scanners.
[01:12:36.212 --> 01:12:37.653]  They're already on the streets in many areas.
[01:12:38.393 --> 01:12:42.856]  We're going to finance all these new face scanning cameras, license plate readers.
[01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.598]  We're taking over, but not to even fight foreign terrorism.
[01:12:47.078 --> 01:12:51.040]  No, the new thing is domestic groups, anti-government groups, and crime.
[01:12:52.609 --> 01:13:04.075]  And Curt Nemo has links here to the government's own press releases that all criminal activity, including pickpocketing and prostitution, homeland security,
[01:13:05.157 --> 01:13:10.238]  Federal police and TSA are going to be there fighting crime.
[01:13:10.878 --> 01:13:11.839]  No more jurisdiction.
[01:13:11.879 --> 01:13:14.539]  Always inserting themselves in any big event.
[01:13:15.139 --> 01:13:20.181]  I mean, the last few years they've had big sys up on telescreens telling the people there to watch each other.
[01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:23.381]  I mean, just a totally paranoid, whacked-out, sick culture.
[01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:26.502]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda publicly works for the banks that run the U.S.
[01:13:27.482 --> 01:13:30.403]  They've given Al-Qaeda Libya, they're giving them Syria, they're giving them everything.
[01:13:32.887 --> 01:13:39.349]  Indianapolis local cops and FBI have set up a massive surveillance grid ahead of the Super Bowl and they have behavioral scanning cameras.
[01:13:40.009 --> 01:14:02.454]  On February 5th, the heightened security including a smartphone photo and video surveillance network, the installation of 150 new manhole covers, like terrorists will put bombs in them, and virtual lockdown of a 44 block area is not response to any possible attack by Al Qaeda, but will be used to quote direct signs of pickpocketing, prostitution and other trouble.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:17.664]  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the Super Bowl rates as a national security event, or NSSE, that may be a target of potential terrorism and other criminal activity, possibly of the sort mentioned above.
[01:14:18.904 --> 01:14:24.726]  And it just goes on to talk about FEMA and all the groups that are going to be there.
[01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:28.633]  Well, it's been a couple of years since I've talked to you, man.
[01:14:28.693 --> 01:14:30.694]  Like most callers, I have to say kudos to you, man.
[01:14:30.714 --> 01:14:33.196]  You've been right on the bat about the things you predicted.
[01:14:33.216 --> 01:14:34.497]  They don't always happen in the exact
[01:14:56.128 --> 01:14:57.109]  Well, I know this.
[01:14:57.209 --> 01:15:00.730]  I was in the Central Counting Area in the Republican primary in 19-
[01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:44.356]  95 for the, or was it 1996, for the 1996 presidential election, I was in the central tabulation area and talked to everybody who was stacking ballots coming in for Travis County and Pat Buchanan had well over half, and I think he got like 2% in the counting when it was all counted, because you would stick the Scantron ballots in a computer.
[01:15:45.036 --> 01:15:47.438]  Now later we found out there was fraud countywide.
[01:15:48.198 --> 01:15:50.800]  Of course, I mean, this is an organized crime syndicate to rob everybody.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:58.133]  I mean, that's how they get away with 80% power price increases in a year and say it's for the earth.
[01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:59.816]  Well, it's really for the groups robbing us.
[01:16:01.866 --> 01:16:04.208]  All over the nation, we're seeing election fraud.
[01:16:04.228 --> 01:16:09.612]  South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, though he still came in second place there.
[01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:13.134]  And undoubtedly, Ron Paul is really the frontrunner.
[01:16:13.374 --> 01:16:14.715]  You've seen him cheat him on time.
[01:16:15.075 --> 01:16:16.837]  You've seen him cheat him on coverage.
[01:16:16.857 --> 01:16:18.218]  When they do cover him, it's negative.
[01:16:18.538 --> 01:16:23.962]  You've seen all the polls where media's cheated, where he's in first or second place, and they just don't even mention that in the poll.
[01:16:24.682 --> 01:16:33.252]  Results so yes, but but see Ron Paul understands if he just says oh, it's all a fraud that will derail momentum and
[01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:45.277]  That won't cause a huge grassroots awakening and then he'll fall behind and won't even be in the debates or stay in these primaries to educate people and to build Campaign for Liberty.
[01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:48.640]  But yes, there is strategic vote fraud all over the country.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.622]  It's undoubtedly being used against Ron Paul with a lot of other attacks.
[01:16:54.103 --> 01:16:59.127]  And he just can't look like a sore loser because still a lot of the public are childlike
[01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:02.987]  I mean, the government took everybody's blood for 40 years secretly at birth.
[01:17:03.408 --> 01:17:05.188]  The government shot up people with syphilis.
[01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:07.469]  The government radiates foster kids to death.
[01:17:07.509 --> 01:17:08.110]  And I don't mean in the 50s.
[01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.290]  Yeah, it happened then, too.
[01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:13.532]  New York Daily News, they grab kids and test pesticides on them until they die.
[01:17:13.632 --> 01:17:14.353]  Look it up, folks.
[01:17:14.873 --> 01:17:19.415]  The people running things are a guild of psycho criminals who have gotten away with
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.200]  Everything.
[01:17:21.341 --> 01:17:23.002]  So why shouldn't they get away with more?
[01:17:23.282 --> 01:17:25.304]  They've had Diebold officials go public.
[01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:27.525]  They've had people be killed who've gone public.
[01:17:27.785 --> 01:17:32.129]  We've certified fraud in Ohio, the 2004 election.
[01:17:32.489 --> 01:17:33.510]  Yes, it's going on.
[01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:40.735]  It's, look, of course a bunch of crooks came in to control this country's $15 trillion a year economy.
[01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:46.940]  When you get rid of checks and balances and don't have paper ballots and it's designed for fraud, you're going to be robbed.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:47.561]  Period, Jim.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.601]  Absolutely man, I agree with you 100% Alex.
[01:17:51.721 --> 01:17:56.043]  And I know everybody I've spoken to, like I said, I speak to people at random.
[01:17:56.083 --> 01:18:00.405]  I'm not afraid to just, you know, strike up a conversation with somebody and see where their mind's at.
[01:18:01.046 --> 01:18:05.888]  Unfortunately, most of them's minds are what you described as within the Overton window.
[01:18:05.908 --> 01:18:10.390]  I rarely ever meet an individual that's able to have free thought.
[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:12.031]  It's so rare anymore.
[01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:18.309]  Well yeah, people value having a restricted and childlike mind.
[01:18:18.349 --> 01:18:21.193]  They think that protects them because they think that makes reality.
[01:18:22.421 --> 01:18:25.183]  It's just because you dress up in a Batman outfit doesn't make you Batman, folks.
[01:18:25.203 --> 01:18:32.248]  It's just because you imagine, oh, that's extreme because lying, talking heads who practice looking official told you so.
[01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:37.472]  But yes, there is incredible systemic election fraud.
[01:18:37.492 --> 01:18:38.533]  That's why they don't care.
[01:18:39.153 --> 01:18:41.535]  There's a 9% approval rating for Congress.
[01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:47.600]  The government is telling us they're allowed to insider trade and that it's legal when it's illegal.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.010]  They're openly massing military force against us, but you know the good news?
[01:18:53.234 --> 01:18:56.356]  The voting that they can't cover up is donations.
[01:18:56.776 --> 01:19:07.141]  Ron Paul, 74%, the last number I saw, of all military donations for the Democrat candidate, Obama, and all the Republicans, go to Ron Paul.
[01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:10.583]  So again, people say, well then why are you saying the military is preparing for war?
[01:19:11.183 --> 01:19:20.808]  They're creating the cadres over the last decade, shifting out who wants to shoot Americans, who is a psycho, or who is so stupid they'll follow orders.
[01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:23.501]  And they've built this army of darkness.
[01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:28.803]  The rest of the troops who know what's going on, that's why the government's now telling cops they're the enemy.
[01:19:29.103 --> 01:19:30.523]  Get ready for war with the vets.
[01:19:30.543 --> 01:19:31.243]  Do you understand that?
[01:19:31.803 --> 01:19:35.384]  We've actually got the vets.
[01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:38.965]  But again, we don't want the physical war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:43.406]  It's not going to do anything to shoot up a bunch of stupid cops and military.
[01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:44.446]  Okay?
[01:19:45.672 --> 01:19:46.573]  It's the globalists.
[01:19:46.633 --> 01:19:48.614]  It's only a few thousand top globalists.
[01:19:48.654 --> 01:19:49.594]  They are the enemy.
[01:19:49.894 --> 01:19:51.755]  We've got to identify the crime syndicate.
[01:19:53.116 --> 01:19:57.538]  If we identify the enemy, and they lose all credibility, they will fall.
[01:19:57.578 --> 01:19:59.039]  They won't get away with the dictatorship.
[01:19:59.219 --> 01:20:01.020]  When they try the dictatorship is when we win.
[01:20:02.561 --> 01:20:06.523]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring?
[01:20:06.763 --> 01:20:12.386]  If so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the way you buy sleep apnea equipment.
[01:20:13.166 --> 01:20:17.129]  What devices you receive, when you get replacement equipment, and even what you pay.
[01:20:17.449 --> 01:20:19.130]  Why limit the quality of your treatment?
[01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:24.173]  Break away from institutionalized healthcare and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.
[01:20:24.393 --> 01:20:26.074]  Shop at CPAP.com.
[01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:26.835]  See what?
[01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:27.475]  CPAP.
[01:20:27.676 --> 01:20:30.117]  It stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.

[01:24:17.059 --> 01:24:29.387]  This is the end, my only friend The end of our elaborate plans The end
[01:24:31.557 --> 01:24:37.321]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:24:37.662 --> 01:24:42.285]  I'm going to go to Wilson and Angie here.
[01:24:42.305 --> 01:24:52.174]  I knew as soon as I gave the number out and only four callers got in there was a phone system problem because we can open the phones up and get a hundred calls in from our great listeners.
[01:24:52.714 --> 01:24:56.637]  The phone system, computer system is locked up so no more calls can come in.
[01:24:56.657 --> 01:24:59.500]  We're going to try to get that rebooted and keep taking your calls.
[01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:04.593]  I've got a bunch of breaking news we'll cover after the break, but right now let's go to Wilson and then Angie.
[01:25:05.235 --> 01:25:06.479]  Wilson in Florida, welcome.
[01:25:07.714 --> 01:25:08.915]  Hey, good afternoon Alex.
[01:25:09.055 --> 01:25:11.557]  It's always good to talk to you.
[01:25:11.677 --> 01:25:24.186]  I'm a student at Miami Dade College in Wolfson Campus downtown and I'm very enthusiastic about the Constitution and about also Ron Paul because he is the one who's enforcing it.
[01:25:24.226 --> 01:25:34.574]  I'm a delivery driver and I even met during a delivery some Ron Paul supporters and they invited me to Duffy's Tavern one time about a week ago.
[01:25:35.294 --> 01:25:35.654]  Well, you know...
[01:26:05.137 --> 01:26:27.783]  Listen, that is actually, if you read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, it's got incredible language, even crazier than the NDAA in many respects, where it says we will create a 10-member governor council, the states will have no more power, those 10 governors serve the president, and this Defense Authorization Act
[01:26:29.662 --> 01:26:37.384]  of 2007 that went into effect 2008, has sections on insurrection in the states even by legislatures.
[01:26:38.064 --> 01:26:52.368]  So it's like an announcement that the Federal District of Criminals, this occupying alien system run by the banks, the foreign banks, is saying we're prepared for the state's rights movement and are prepared for war.
[01:26:52.948 --> 01:26:54.469]  And of course they activated NORTHCOM.
[01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:59.111]  And NORTHCOM is a military jurisdiction over the United States.
[01:26:59.152 --> 01:27:00.152]  Look at AFRICOM.
[01:27:00.793 --> 01:27:02.253]  It's now a jurisdiction over Africa.
[01:27:02.273 --> 01:27:04.755]  They just attack and kill whoever they want, whenever they want, anywhere.
[01:27:05.475 --> 01:27:10.618]  Now under NDAA 2012, that they passed in 2011, just a month ago, exactly today, it was the 31st of December 2011, they openly say they're
[01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:31.535]  That worldwide, without Congressional approval, the President or the military leadership, the Secretary of Defense can kill anybody they want, anytime, attack any country or any person.
[01:27:31.895 --> 01:27:35.458]  That's just a global declaration of war that would make Hitler blush.
[01:27:36.959 --> 01:27:41.562]  We'll kill our own citizens, arrest them, secretly disappear them.
[01:27:42.363 --> 01:27:44.364]  And Senator Graham goes, you bet we'll kill you.
[01:27:44.424 --> 01:27:44.745]  You bet.
[01:27:44.785 --> 01:27:45.525]  You don't get a lawyer.
[01:27:45.986 --> 01:27:46.946]  I want you to be scared.
[01:27:48.723 --> 01:27:50.645]  Santorum says, hey, we're already killing U.S.
[01:27:50.685 --> 01:27:52.306]  citizens without charging them.
[01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:54.548]  Of course it's for killing Americans.
[01:27:55.028 --> 01:28:02.334]  I mean, these are terrorists who tell us that they're doing this to fight al-Qaeda when al-Qaeda publicly works for them.
[01:28:03.174 --> 01:28:10.660]  It's like the troops publicly grow the opium on the news, and the cops are doing drag nets looking for heroin.
[01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:16.805]  I mean, it's bonker land, cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, in-our-face crazy.
[01:28:18.874 --> 01:28:19.715]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:28:19.755 --> 01:28:25.323]  It's like the media says vaccines don't cause autism, but the insert says it can cause brain damage.
[01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:32.923]  And Guillain-Barre's and neurological disorders and Parkinson's and all that, or kill you.
[01:28:32.943 --> 01:28:39.168]  I mean, the insert says it can do it, but then you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it's doing it.
[01:28:39.188 --> 01:28:40.549]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:28:40.569 --> 01:28:42.310]  It's all insane.
[01:28:42.691 --> 01:28:43.692]  It's insane.
[01:28:44.072 --> 01:28:45.093]  It's insane.
[01:28:45.393 --> 01:28:46.374]  It's insane.
[01:28:46.734 --> 01:28:47.614]  It's crazy.
[01:28:47.635 --> 01:28:51.958]  The UN runs giant child kidnapping rings publicly.
[01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:59.649]  They've got private contractor groups that do it internationally running CPS all over the US.
[01:28:59.889 --> 01:29:00.791]  They do it here!
[01:29:01.792 --> 01:29:03.294]  It's already going on!
[01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:08.422]  But people think it's no big deal because the media doesn't make a big issue out of it.
[01:29:08.803 --> 01:29:09.423]  Anything else, sir?
[01:29:10.936 --> 01:29:11.737]  Yep, yep Trouble.
[01:29:11.757 --> 01:29:14.258]  I'm glad you know you put out all the information.
[01:29:14.398 --> 01:29:16.019]  I know we have a lot against us.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:21.743]  But I'm very optimistic, especially that we have such great intellectual minds on our side, especially like you.
[01:29:22.264 --> 01:29:31.109]  Even that I delivered to downtown in Brickell here in Miami that some of the wealthiest people on the top penthouse floor, I have conversations with them and they're aware.
[01:29:41.496 --> 01:29:42.216]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:42.817]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.439 --> 01:29:52.379]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.819 --> 01:29:54.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.041]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.185 --> 01:30:06.009]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.212]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[01:30:08.612 --> 01:30:10.094]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:30:10.474 --> 01:30:12.997]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[01:30:13.437 --> 01:30:19.945]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:30:20.425 --> 01:30:23.648]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:28.591]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:30:28.892 --> 01:30:30.153]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:30:30.413 --> 01:30:31.474]  Your food supply.
[01:30:31.834 --> 01:30:35.697]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[01:31:01.786 --> 01:31:06.009]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:06.329 --> 01:31:06.930]  Number 1.
[01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:10.392]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.673 --> 01:31:11.233]  Number 2.
[01:31:11.533 --> 01:31:16.077]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:16.857]  It's true.
[01:31:17.157 --> 01:31:21.721]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:22.581]  Number 3.
[01:31:22.862 --> 01:31:26.144]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:26.444 --> 01:31:30.147]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:30.347 --> 01:31:30.888]  Number 4.
[01:31:31.148 --> 01:31:33.510]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:37.294]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:37.594 --> 01:31:37.794]  Number 5.
[01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:42.298]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:42.518 --> 01:31:47.283]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:47.563 --> 01:31:51.586]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.746 --> 01:31:53.308]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:07.033]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:07.373 --> 01:32:15.500]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:20.263]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:20.864 --> 01:32:31.693]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:41.316]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:41.816 --> 01:32:46.838]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:47.238 --> 01:32:54.421]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:54.741 --> 01:32:57.482]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:17.938 --> 01:33:21.983]  Okay, my friends, the phone system has come back up and is allowing calls in.
[01:33:22.003 --> 01:33:23.805]  So I see they've loaded up there.
[01:33:23.845 --> 01:33:25.507]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:25.587 --> 01:33:30.192]  Let me go to these two calls that have been holding.
[01:33:30.533 --> 01:33:31.774]  Then I'll get to some more of the news.
[01:33:31.854 --> 01:33:32.715]  It's really important.
[01:33:33.756 --> 01:33:45.020]  And then we will go back to your calls ahead of Dr. Catherine Albrecht joining us to look at the attack on internet freedom worldwide, what Google's up to, and the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say.
[01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:47.281]  But going back to Wilson in Florida.
[01:33:47.301 --> 01:33:52.583]  So Wilson, you're saying you deliver stuff as I guess part of a courier service or whatever you're doing.
[01:33:52.924 --> 01:33:57.405]  So you're talking to a lot of wealthy people and you chat them up and they're aware of what's going on.
[01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:58.786]  That's what I'm finding.
[01:33:59.526 --> 01:34:06.688]  I cannot put numbers on it, but it is exponential, the fact that people are really getting it.
[01:34:07.228 --> 01:34:16.331]  But even if they're getting that the government's corrupt and run by crooks, they've got to get the fact that it's run by super nasty, super evil people.
[01:34:17.832 --> 01:34:24.574]  I mean, the fact that the UN and others and our government is involved in the sex traffic, including children, I mean, that is
[01:34:26.630 --> 01:34:27.590]  The worst of the worst.
[01:34:27.630 --> 01:34:31.191]  I mean, even in prisons, those are the people that don't live a day.
[01:34:31.991 --> 01:34:38.073]  I mean, even amongst criminals, rapists and murderers, they don't put up with people that target kids.
[01:34:38.533 --> 01:34:41.874]  I mean, it's the worst of the worst of the worst.
[01:34:42.054 --> 01:34:45.675]  And you automatically can't believe anything they say.
[01:34:45.715 --> 01:34:47.535]  You automatically can't believe anything they do.
[01:34:47.836 --> 01:34:49.136]  And it's never true anyways.
[01:34:50.134 --> 01:34:52.717]  But these are confirmed known liars.
[01:34:53.398 --> 01:35:01.287]  It's like the video I did last Friday that's gone viral at Infowars.com titled, TSA, The Greatest Liars on Earth.
[01:35:02.068 --> 01:35:02.809]  You want to fight them?
[01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:04.952]  This is coffin nails.
[01:35:04.992 --> 01:35:06.734]  This is cyanide to their lies.
[01:35:07.314 --> 01:35:09.757]  This is holy water to the vampire.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.741]  This is high noon to a goblin.
[01:35:13.261 --> 01:35:17.483]  You need to get that video and get it out to everybody you know.
[01:35:18.183 --> 01:35:19.344]  It is so informative.
[01:35:20.004 --> 01:35:22.645]  And it doesn't just cover TSA lies, it covers government lies.
[01:35:23.586 --> 01:35:28.768]  I got some breaking news concerning the TSA that Kurt Nemo is working on right now, but we're going to go back to your calls.
[01:35:28.968 --> 01:35:30.029]  Finish up your point, Wilson.
[01:35:30.049 --> 01:35:30.789]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:35:31.801 --> 01:35:32.501]  Oh, yep, yep.
[01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:39.364]  Well, um, see, like I said, I also am a student at Miami Dade, and I deliver for Pizza Hut, so you know it's nothing big.
[01:35:39.945 --> 01:35:48.889]  But, um, I had a lot of extra copies from the last semester, from the December 8th issue, when I wrote an article, it was titled, The Founding Fathers Premonitions.
[01:35:49.509 --> 01:35:52.852]  So I was passing out a whole bunch of those articles to almost every customer.
[01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:55.434]  You know, I got a lot of good feedback from a lot of people.
[01:35:55.454 --> 01:35:57.035]  Surprisingly, you know?
[01:35:57.255 --> 01:36:02.559]  Some people just showed no interest when I gave it to them, but the next time I showed up, they was really enthusiastic.
[01:36:19.939 --> 01:36:26.807]  I have been doing this 17 years, and I got recognized right off the bat every once in a while.
[01:36:27.227 --> 01:36:30.190]  But in the last decade, everywhere I go, I get recognized.
[01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.533]  People buy me dinner when I'm in a restaurant.
[01:36:33.253 --> 01:36:34.315]  I'm not asking folks to.
[01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:37.718]  It's actually kind of weird when people do stuff for you, but the point is,
[01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:41.918]  Now, I can't walk the dog down the street.
[01:36:42.038 --> 01:36:43.299]  I can't walk into a mall.
[01:36:43.419 --> 01:36:45.681]  I can't go in a grocery store ten feet.
[01:36:46.202 --> 01:36:47.623]  I mean, I go to the grocery store anywhere.
[01:36:47.703 --> 01:36:48.904]  It's every third person.
[01:36:49.364 --> 01:36:51.626]  I can go to foreign countries.
[01:36:51.707 --> 01:36:54.149]  I can be in a poor fishing village in Honduras.
[01:36:54.489 --> 01:36:55.850]  Or I can be in southern Mexico.
[01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.412]  And the tour bus driver's a listener.
[01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:03.036]  I mean, it is... And again, I'm just one person.
[01:37:03.866 --> 01:37:07.787]  So, I'm telling you, our numbers are much greater than we even know.
[01:37:08.148 --> 01:37:18.351]  The average person isn't recognized, isn't known, isn't a, quote, public person, and so you don't have an idea how awake people are.
[01:37:18.631 --> 01:37:19.111]  I do.
[01:37:20.032 --> 01:37:22.092]  I do, folks, and it is exciting.
[01:37:22.293 --> 01:37:22.773]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:37:24.193 --> 01:37:25.914]  So, yep, my last question is...
[01:37:26.838 --> 01:37:28.319]  I know you speak to Ron Paul a lot.
[01:37:28.359 --> 01:37:30.901]  I'll be voting for him tomorrow in the Florida primary.
[01:37:30.921 --> 01:37:38.465]  But my question is, before all this is over, before he's... I mean, hopefully he does win the presidency, you know?
[01:37:38.685 --> 01:37:39.746]  I think that would be great for us.
[01:37:40.569 --> 01:37:46.336]  But I would like to see if he could speak directly to President Obama.
[01:37:46.356 --> 01:37:51.942]  You know, I've never seen him speak directly to him and that would just, I think that would be amazing.
[01:37:52.022 --> 01:37:55.025]  I think it would be all over the news.
[01:37:55.306 --> 01:37:58.609]  Did you hear my last interview with Ron Paul about a month ago?
[01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:02.451]  I must have not heard it.
[01:38:02.531 --> 01:38:07.193]  Yeah, we should re-air it because it's probably the best interview I've ever done of over a hundred with him.
[01:38:07.953 --> 01:38:12.495]  And I said to him, I said, Congressman, why are you attacking the other candidates?
[01:38:12.555 --> 01:38:18.897]  I know you need to do that because of their records, but I think you should do what Romney's doing, attack up, go after Obama.
[01:38:19.738 --> 01:38:22.539]  And he said, I agree with you.
[01:38:22.559 --> 01:38:26.100]  I need to do that more.
[01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:27.181]  And so,
[01:38:28.297 --> 01:38:29.577]  I'm not going to get in the middle of it.
[01:38:29.657 --> 01:38:38.741]  Ron Paul's got a lot of great people working for him, but he's also got kind of mainline Republican types as well because they're just part of the establishment there in D.C.
[01:38:38.781 --> 01:38:41.782]  That's who there is available from that pool of people.
[01:38:43.062 --> 01:38:45.203]  And he's got a great chief of staff in Congress.
[01:38:47.692 --> 01:38:50.935]  But I'm not going to sit here and second-guess Ron Paul all day.
[01:38:51.795 --> 01:38:52.776]  He's done a great job.
[01:38:53.757 --> 01:38:58.261]  I don't think he should do so much retail politicking, exhausting himself eight hours a day shaking hands.
[01:38:58.701 --> 01:39:01.844]  I'm sorry, he needs to hit them with electronic media.
[01:39:01.904 --> 01:39:07.689]  That's where you... People always want me to travel and speak here and do this, that, and talk to folks there.
[01:39:09.195 --> 01:39:10.195]  And I do do some of that.
[01:39:10.275 --> 01:39:16.057]  It's just that I turn down radio interviews every day where I'd be talking to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions.
[01:39:16.658 --> 01:39:17.878]  So why should I travel?
[01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:22.119]  And in the time that I do that and speak, I could talk to five million people.
[01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:23.480]  Instead, I go speak to a thousand.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:33.623]  And I understand it's important to do some of that, but I just think he should go pretty much all electronic because he's old and it's exhausting him to do all that retail politicking.
[01:39:34.504 --> 01:39:38.245]  And I think he should be savaging Obama as a lying globalist puppet.
[01:39:39.185 --> 01:39:43.466]  And, you know, that would really fire up the Republican base as well.
[01:39:44.087 --> 01:39:45.367]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:45.387 --> 01:39:46.507]  I've already brought it up to him.
[01:39:48.228 --> 01:39:49.068]  I mean, here's the deal.
[01:39:50.449 --> 01:39:51.849]  I've got Ron Paul's home phone number.
[01:39:51.869 --> 01:39:52.969]  I can try to get all of them that way.
[01:39:53.029 --> 01:39:54.250]  I know some of his family.
[01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:56.090]  I can call Congress.
[01:39:57.311 --> 01:40:02.872]  Sometimes when they don't set him up for the show, I've got to call his chief of staff and say, hey, they're not setting him up.
[01:40:03.453 --> 01:40:06.173]  He wants to come on every month, but it's every six, eight weeks.
[01:40:06.634 --> 01:40:07.994]  If he's too busy, I understand.
[01:40:10.299 --> 01:40:12.262]  And then they go ask Ron Paul, and he's like, no, I want to come on.
[01:40:12.302 --> 01:40:19.210]  And I've talked to Ron Paul, you know, before, off air, and said, hey, do you want to come on every six months if you're busy?
[01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.073]  Because it's like pulling teeth to get you on.
[01:40:21.093 --> 01:40:22.094]  He goes, no, we're just really busy.
[01:40:22.114 --> 01:40:22.915]  I want to come on every month.
[01:40:23.415 --> 01:40:24.797]  He doesn't say something if he doesn't want to.
[01:40:25.238 --> 01:40:27.540]  And then it's just pulling teeth getting through the gatekeepers.
[01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:30.522]  Because obviously he's super busy.
[01:40:30.942 --> 01:40:32.042]  Obviously it takes time.
[01:40:32.082 --> 01:40:32.963]  He can't do everything.
[01:40:33.343 --> 01:40:35.784]  So I'm not even blaming people there.
[01:40:36.344 --> 01:40:37.684]  I don't even try to give him my advice.
[01:40:37.784 --> 01:40:39.165]  I rarely give Ron Paul advice.
[01:40:39.245 --> 01:40:40.445]  I did last time he was on.
[01:40:41.646 --> 01:40:42.686]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:40:42.906 --> 01:40:45.087]  He's always on top of every news item I raise.
[01:40:45.447 --> 01:40:46.427]  He lives this stuff.
[01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:47.448]  He is conscious.
[01:40:47.488 --> 01:40:48.128]  He is awake.
[01:40:49.469 --> 01:40:50.429]  And he's a real person.
[01:40:50.469 --> 01:40:52.210]  He has basically no ego.
[01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:55.711]  I can tell you looking at him and watching him, he's in the machine mode.
[01:40:56.747 --> 01:40:59.809]  I'm in the machine mode, but I'm not disciplined enough to not get angry.
[01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:04.871]  Because it's so ridiculous how over-the-top the corruption is.
[01:41:04.911 --> 01:41:18.758]  I mean, it's almost like after you've already convicted somebody 5,000 times, okay, they committed another 5,000 murders, we're going to have 5,000 more trials, and then sit here and try to convince people that we've got corrupt elites that are out of control?
[01:41:19.459 --> 01:41:22.160]  I mean, that's like convincing people to not jump off a cliff.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.381]  I mean, I shouldn't.
[01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:25.462]  Everybody should see this for themselves.
[01:41:30.134 --> 01:41:30.776]  Ron Paul.
[01:41:30.796 --> 01:41:35.266]  See, I don't even want to get into the advice department for Ron Paul.
[01:41:35.286 --> 01:41:37.451]  Because he's the one in the arena right now.
[01:41:38.661 --> 01:41:39.241]  And you know what?
[01:41:39.381 --> 01:41:41.943]  He's got to take the punches that are getting thrown at him.
[01:41:42.263 --> 01:41:43.384]  He's got to throw his punches.
[01:41:44.324 --> 01:41:46.365]  And that's why I understand you want to give him advice.
[01:41:46.425 --> 01:41:47.686]  I've given him that exact advice.
[01:41:47.946 --> 01:41:53.149]  But then it just opens up a Pandora's box of issues.
[01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.752]  So I just go through channels, send our email.
[01:41:58.792 --> 01:41:59.852]  Hey, we want to get Ron Paul on.
[01:41:59.872 --> 01:42:01.333]  We'll tape it if you want or live.
[01:42:02.053 --> 01:42:02.654]  Whatever you want.
[01:42:03.374 --> 01:42:12.777]  And then if that goes on sometimes for a couple weeks after, you know, a month, then I have to like, go above people's heads and get a hold of the top folks.
[01:42:15.838 --> 01:42:17.638]  But that happens in any organization.
[01:42:18.638 --> 01:42:24.400]  Ron Paul's awesome, but I want to explain to people, don't be disillusioned.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.921]  This is what I said when I said you got to run for
[01:42:28.137 --> 01:42:28.777]  President again.
[01:42:28.797 --> 01:42:29.498]  We're drafting him.
[01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:30.418]  Remember a year and a half ago?
[01:42:30.798 --> 01:42:31.559]  Remember Rand Paul?
[01:42:31.619 --> 01:42:33.020]  I talked to him off air and on air.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:34.861]  I'm like, you know, you've really got to run.
[01:42:36.602 --> 01:42:38.803]  Well, that's why I'm coming on your show to see if there's interest.
[01:42:39.483 --> 01:42:41.504]  Okay, where's the exploratory website, folks?
[01:42:41.524 --> 01:42:42.044]  Give them money.
[01:42:42.585 --> 01:42:49.488]  And it was the money our audience, on record, gave him up front that made Rand Paul realize he could get the money in he needed.
[01:42:49.728 --> 01:42:54.051]  It was our listeners, on record, that went and formed the core of his volunteers.
[01:42:55.148 --> 01:42:58.752]  And that's why a lot of Rand Paul's people, you know, came right out of this audience.
[01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:07.980]  That's why Ron Paul, four years ago, four plus years ago, right before the New Hampshire primary, out of the blue on my show, said, I want to thank your audience.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.342]  They've been half of our support.
[01:43:10.762 --> 01:43:12.023]  I mean, you look at Ron Paul on TV.
[01:43:12.063 --> 01:43:15.925]  He's always signing InfoWars shirts, signing InfoWars bumper stickers.
[01:43:15.965 --> 01:43:19.806]  He's always... People are, you know, photographed with InfoWars bracelets on.
[01:43:20.487 --> 01:43:21.427]  Ron Paul knows that.
[01:43:21.507 --> 01:43:25.089]  He knows that half his support stills this radio show.
[01:43:25.409 --> 01:43:27.630]  So this radio show is a big, giant secret.
[01:43:28.871 --> 01:43:30.472]  It's not a secret to those that are awake.
[01:43:30.512 --> 01:43:31.892]  It's not a secret to those that listen.
[01:43:32.493 --> 01:43:37.055]  But the establishment media has always tried to ignore the show, like it didn't exist.
[01:43:38.092 --> 01:43:41.354]  Even though we have a bigger audience in most cases than they do.
[01:43:42.996 --> 01:43:44.637]  See, it's all about the pageantry.
[01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:45.978]  It's all about the show.
[01:43:46.898 --> 01:43:56.705]  It's all about makeup and perfect ties and perfect teleprompters and someone looking convincing when they talk to you.
[01:43:58.346 --> 01:44:03.170]  You know when these teleprompters, when they talk about a kid that's died, they tell them, look concerned.
[01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:08.280]  Or when they talk about Ron Paul, it'll say, you know, look disgusted.
[01:44:10.262 --> 01:44:13.064]  And these people act like they know what they're talking about.
[01:44:13.084 --> 01:44:20.190]  They get there 20 minutes before, their makeup's all on, they go in, and they just sit there and try to look official.
[01:44:21.451 --> 01:44:24.113]  I mean, John Bounds worked in TV stations around the country.
[01:44:24.413 --> 01:44:24.994]  He'll tell you that.
[01:44:25.034 --> 01:44:31.499]  People show up, they spend hours in there watching TV, listening to radio, playing around, putting makeup on.
[01:44:31.779 --> 01:44:33.621]  They come right out and read the teleprompter.
[01:44:34.443 --> 01:44:38.426]  And sit there and act like they've got emotions and like they care about what you're saying and what you're doing.
[01:44:39.187 --> 01:44:41.008]  And it's the Emperor's new clothes.
[01:44:41.048 --> 01:44:41.829]  You know that whole parable?
[01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:43.830]  He's all dressed up in these fancy outfit.
[01:44:45.832 --> 01:44:45.952]  And...
[01:44:47.935 --> 01:44:49.256]  He's really wearing no clothes at all.
[01:44:49.697 --> 01:44:59.027]  But because everyone says, look how beautiful his cloak is, no one wants to admit he's actually butt naked in the parade until a two-year-old steps up and laughs and says, the emperor's naked.
[01:44:59.748 --> 01:45:01.850]  And then somebody else laughs, and then somebody else laughs.
[01:45:02.311 --> 01:45:04.873]  All we gotta do is call these crooks ridiculous bluff.
[01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:07.416]  All right, I gotta hurry through calls now.
[01:45:07.596 --> 01:45:08.938]  Angie in North Carolina, welcome.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.221]  Hi, Alice.
[01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:13.082]  It's a pleasure to speak to you again.
[01:45:13.102 --> 01:45:24.791]  You spoke to me recently and interviewed my husband about the Blue Force situational awareness that they're setting up under the continuity programs.
[01:45:26.204 --> 01:45:30.806]  I wanted to call and connect some really important dots that are floating around out there for people.
[01:45:31.566 --> 01:45:37.488]  First, I wanted to give you what I think might be a solution to your mainstream media moniker dilemma.
[01:45:37.508 --> 01:45:39.908]  I think you should call them exactly what they are.
[01:45:39.948 --> 01:45:41.349]  They're the mainstream mafia.
[01:45:41.369 --> 01:45:43.470]  They are, yeah.
[01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:44.170]  That's a good name.
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:45.260]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:46.361]  Okay.
[01:45:46.541 --> 01:46:06.151]  In late fall, around late October, early November last year, right around the time of the holidays, a recommendation came out by the National Biodefense Science Board, which is under Health and Human Services, and they recommended that we
[01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:17.731]  Not just revisit the issue, they recommend that we actually begin to test anthrax vaccines on the pediatric population.
[01:46:18.051 --> 01:46:19.512]  Oh yeah, I forgot to cover that.
[01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:29.799]  Guys, when you type in government wants to test anthrax vaccine on children or wants to give anthrax vaccine to children, that was in the news last week.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:31.921]  I didn't even cover it, it was in the Associated Press.
[01:46:32.521 --> 01:46:36.044]  And for those that don't know, they had to suspend it twice because it was killing the troops.
[01:46:36.985 --> 01:46:44.761]  And so yes, now the American Medical Association says they want to start forcing vaccines, including experimental, on the public.
[01:46:45.744 --> 01:46:46.064]  Go ahead.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.042]  My husband has actually had that vaccine.
[01:46:49.062 --> 01:46:51.604]  He was in the first desert storm.
[01:46:52.064 --> 01:46:55.147]  And he's got residual problems from that vaccine.
[01:46:55.187 --> 01:46:58.790]  He's got problems with his memory and all kinds of issues.
[01:46:58.810 --> 01:47:06.896]  And so does, by the way, a friend of ours who's a minister, who they were over, him and his wife were over for dinner last night.
[01:47:07.297 --> 01:47:11.180]  He's also had that vaccine and he's also got issues as a result of it.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.782]  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to tell you, it's a soft kill.
[01:47:13.822 --> 01:47:18.647]  It's meant that after a veteran served their time to be debilitating, but there's ways to try to reverse it.
[01:47:18.888 --> 01:47:20.349]  I've had medical doctors on.
[01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:32.982]  There were actual court-martials that began, as you know, in Denver and other areas, when their own doctor said, look, I just gave 100 people this shot, one of them died, five are having convulsions, something's wrong.
[01:47:33.755 --> 01:47:35.337]  And they said, put them in irons.
[01:47:36.278 --> 01:47:38.901]  And again, then they said, you've got to follow orders to take the shot.
[01:47:39.622 --> 01:47:43.687]  You have to take the shot if you're in the military, if it's an approved, confirmed vaccine.
[01:47:44.068 --> 01:47:48.513]  But under law, you cannot force an experimental shot on troops.
[01:47:48.914 --> 01:47:51.417]  And it turns out they were using them as guinea pigs, as you know.
[01:47:51.717 --> 01:47:52.018]  Go ahead.
[01:47:52.839 --> 01:47:53.119]  Right.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.784]  Now, that recommendation came out and some websites wrote articles about it.
[01:47:58.824 --> 01:48:09.433]  There was an article in Science Insider on October 28th, and a quote from this article is, even if this study goes forward, it'll have to jump through hoops.
[01:48:10.013 --> 01:48:21.136]  But it's about setting the precedent to even give boys an MMR shot that killed girls in the trials and kills them now and doesn't protect you from the papillomavirus.
[01:48:21.216 --> 01:48:24.576]  The insert says, in fact we found the article, let's put it on screen.
[01:48:35.959 --> 01:48:38.081]  This is from Medical News Today.
[01:48:38.101 --> 01:48:42.223]  Federal government wants to test anthrax vaccine on children.
[01:48:42.584 --> 01:48:43.224]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[01:48:43.244 --> 01:48:43.644]  Go ahead.
[01:48:44.305 --> 01:48:52.490]  Yeah, what they're looking to do is the scientists are salivating for the data that they ethically cannot gather.
[01:48:52.631 --> 01:48:53.631]  That's what they want to do.
[01:48:53.711 --> 01:48:58.875]  It's not about protecting anybody from a ridiculously unlikely anthrax attack.
[01:48:59.619 --> 01:49:01.020]  Ma'am, you know what's going on.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.581]  I mean, anybody can look this up.
[01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:08.846]  Until three years ago, every doctor, every nurse was trained, everyone knew, you don't give a pregnant woman vaccines.
[01:49:09.286 --> 01:49:13.929]  It's been proven to cause deformities, health problems, and miscarriages.
[01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:20.354]  Now, instead, they flip it and say, pregnant women are who you want to give all the shots, and it's killing them.
[01:49:20.374 --> 01:49:25.297]  They're testing bold in your face, killing us, and getting away with it.
[01:49:25.318 --> 01:49:25.638]  Go ahead.
[01:49:26.769 --> 01:49:33.092]  Well, the President Obama, with the passage of an Executive Order No.
[01:49:33.112 --> 01:49:39.315]  13521 on November 24th of 2009, he established the Bioethics Committee.
[01:49:39.975 --> 01:49:44.598]  Now, the Bioethics Committee, first of all, the website is bioethics.gov.
[01:49:45.658 --> 01:49:50.761]  And it's a treasure trove of information, if you guys have time to comb through it.
[01:49:51.221 --> 01:50:11.651]  There's transcriptions on the sites of all the meetings they've had so far, and meetings they've got coming up, about all kinds of unbelievable things, such as meeting for Session 10, they talked about testing directed energy weapons on the population, and you know, I think it's kind of a test
[01:50:12.311 --> 01:50:15.753]  ...to find out what the population knows about certain things.
[01:50:15.873 --> 01:50:22.617]  But on January 6th, Kathleen Sebelius submitted a letter.
[01:50:22.657 --> 01:50:35.044]  Now, if you go to the news section under bioethics.gov, on January 11th, I believe it was, they posted the blog about a January 6th letter that came from Kathleen Sebelius.
[01:50:35.724 --> 01:50:38.186]  And in this letter, she asked them
[01:50:39.918 --> 01:50:42.440]  To convene a panel, do you want to take this break?
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.541]  Yeah, we'll go to break and come back with that.
[01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:50.625]  Yeah, for those that don't know, bioethics is really just eugenics, and they claim it's the ethics of science.
[01:50:50.645 --> 01:50:51.845]  Well, we have the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:50:52.406 --> 01:50:55.628]  They've gotten rid of the Hippocratic Oath, and basically it's the death panels.
[01:50:56.908 --> 01:50:57.729]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.289 --> 01:51:00.090]  It's these quasi-governmental boards.
[01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.671]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:03.532]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.772 --> 01:51:14.224]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:51:14.444 --> 01:51:18.529]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:51:18.889 --> 01:51:21.311]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:51:21.631 --> 01:51:32.480]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.083]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:51:36.403 --> 01:51:42.064]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:51:42.544 --> 01:51:52.046]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:51:52.426 --> 01:51:53.626]  The war is here.
[01:51:53.926 --> 01:51:55.367]  It's an info war.
[01:51:55.827 --> 01:51:58.627]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:04.489]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:06.550]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:11.631]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products.
[01:52:11.811 --> 01:52:15.232]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:40.720]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[01:53:03.285 --> 01:53:06.428]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:35.932]  In a coming-apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:53:36.213 --> 01:53:45.400]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA from exotic braids for military, rescue, arborist, shipyards, towline, or boating.

[01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:00.172]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:54:05.782 --> 01:54:11.004]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:18.167]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:54:18.627 --> 01:54:21.828]  But nobody wants to know him.
[01:54:22.228 --> 01:54:25.890]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:31.532]  And he never gives an answer, but the fool... I mean, here's another article.
[01:54:31.612 --> 01:54:34.753]  I just typed in anthrax vaccine children.
[01:54:36.414 --> 01:54:37.134]  And look at this headline.
[01:54:37.194 --> 01:54:40.616]  Major drug maker accused of killing 14 trial suspects.
[01:54:42.437 --> 01:54:42.937]  Suspects.
[01:54:42.957 --> 01:54:44.598]  I guess the children are suspects to be killed.
[01:54:44.658 --> 01:54:45.158]  Subjects.
[01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:47.039]  And there's a CNN report.
[01:54:47.179 --> 01:54:51.341]  Argentina finds drug company over vaccine deaths.
[01:54:51.541 --> 01:54:55.603]  And of course it's vaccine company coming at you with the...
[01:54:57.396 --> 01:55:08.922]  The Nuremberg Code provides ethical guidelines for medical research to protect human test subjects and scientific experiments from injury, disability, or death, but our government violates that.
[01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:12.002]  I mean, they do it on foster kids, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:12.682 --> 01:55:36.752]  When you learn that you're seen as lab rats, literally, and that you're seen as scum and trash by the ruling class, and this is all a big medical experiment, the whole thing, the TV, the fluoride in the water, the GMO, the drugging of school kids, when you wake up to just how horrifying it is, and you learn that they're setting up these death panels, that they're telling doctors what health care you can give people, Bill Gates admits this,
[01:55:37.717 --> 01:55:41.518]  Newsweek says the case for killing Granny and shows Granny being unplugged.
[01:55:42.958 --> 01:55:49.099]  And now they're going to have the Federal Bioethics Board coming out and saying, yes, we're just going to give your kids shots whether you like it or not.
[01:55:49.699 --> 01:55:51.259]  This is an assault.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:54.040]  But they've learned to slow kill you.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:58.281]  They just shoot you up, screw you up, and kind of walk off giggling.
[01:55:58.301 --> 01:56:01.341]  This is how the creepy technocrats hit you and hit you hard.
[01:56:01.961 --> 01:56:05.002]  I need to get to other callers, Angie, but finishing up your point about this, go ahead.
[01:56:06.095 --> 01:56:21.705]  Right, well, so Kathleen Sebelius wrote this letter on January 6th asking this bioethics commission to convene a board to review basically how to get around the ethical issues with testing this anthrax vaccine on children.
[01:56:23.845 --> 01:56:30.909]  She also recommends that they gather pre- and post-trial information.
[01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:41.435]  She wants them to give her ways to get around the ethical problems with testing the AVA, which is the anthrax vaccine absorbed.
[01:56:42.135 --> 01:56:43.917]  Let's see, they've got a beta test.
[01:57:05.071 --> 01:57:06.672]  Just killing the kids out in the open.
[01:57:06.692 --> 01:57:10.874]  I mean, the dead mount, the cancer mounts, leading the world in every disease now.
[01:57:11.214 --> 01:57:15.556]  And they just sit there with straight faces going, we love you, we love you, we love you.
[01:57:15.576 --> 01:57:16.556]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:16.576 --> 01:57:19.397]  It's good to hear from you and the great work you guys are doing.
[01:57:19.437 --> 01:57:19.898]  God bless.
[01:57:19.918 --> 01:57:25.160]  We're going to go to break for five, for one minute and come back with a short five minute segment.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:26.460]  Then Catherine Albrecht is our guest.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:30.902]  We're going to go to Tony, Julio, John and Mouse and everybody else that's holding.
[01:57:30.942 --> 01:57:31.723]  I'll get to everybody.
[01:57:32.623 --> 01:57:35.064]  But I'll get to a few of those calls in the next segment.
[01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:36.445]  I've covered some of the news.
[01:57:36.465 --> 01:57:37.865]  There's still a lot of it I've got to go over.
[01:57:37.886 --> 01:57:41.587]  I'm going to throw some of this news at Catherine Albrecht and get her take on it.
[01:57:41.607 --> 01:57:42.588]  She'll be with us at the 5 after.
[01:57:44.184 --> 01:57:49.105]  Briefly, knowledge is power and it's important to expose false flag terror.
[01:57:49.545 --> 01:57:52.966]  A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 1995, is an excellent film.
[01:57:53.386 --> 01:57:54.967]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:57:54.987 --> 01:57:56.867]  Your purchase supports our broadcast as well.
[01:57:57.287 --> 01:58:00.408]  The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby, back in print.
[01:58:00.928 --> 01:58:06.590]  Excellent to give all educators you know so they understand why they're not allowed to truly educate but only indoctrinate.
[01:58:07.450 --> 01:58:10.131]  We have the new film Indoctrination as well that goes with it.
[01:58:10.191 --> 01:58:10.771]  It's excellent.
[01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:12.571]  And Bloodlines the Illuminati.
[01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:16.892]  You know we've got a couple thousand of these and I thought that would last us a while.
[01:58:18.112 --> 01:58:20.113]  But you better order them before we sell out.
[01:58:20.973 --> 01:58:24.714]  Bloodlines the Illuminati has been out of print for a while and been very hard to get.
[01:58:24.734 --> 01:58:28.075]  Well I went ahead and just had a bunch of them printed up with the author.
[01:58:28.515 --> 01:58:30.075]  So we have them in stock right now.
[01:58:30.115 --> 01:58:33.536]  But at the rate they're going in three or four days they might all be gone.
[01:58:34.056 --> 01:58:36.797]  Bloodlines Illuminati available at m4wars.com.

[01:58:53.385 --> 01:58:57.008]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:57.408 --> 01:59:00.411]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:59:00.651 --> 01:59:05.455]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:59:06.215 --> 01:59:11.660]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.082]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:14.622 --> 01:59:14.902]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:14.922 --> 01:59:15.343]  Bernanke?
[01:59:15.443 --> 01:59:16.063]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:16.103 --> 01:59:17.364]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:17.384 --> 01:59:19.626]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:33.516 --> 01:59:35.356]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:35.636 --> 01:59:40.438]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:40.778 --> 01:59:50.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:59:57.441 --> 02:00:00.222]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.738 --> 02:00:10.943]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.584 --> 02:00:12.385]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.166 --> 02:00:14.087]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.707 --> 02:00:18.292]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.892 --> 02:00:22.977]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.769 --> 02:00:41.874]  Okay, Catherine Albrecht, expert on different types of globalist tracking grid, is joining us.
[02:00:41.894 --> 02:00:47.238]  We've got some breaking news on the Super Bowl I'll cover as well as soon as Kurt's got his article done.
[02:00:47.258 --> 02:00:48.839]  It'll be up at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:51.981]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:52.081 --> 02:00:53.843]  Tony in Idaho, you're on the air.
[02:00:53.883 --> 02:00:54.483]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:55.664 --> 02:00:56.064]  All right.
[02:00:57.045 --> 02:00:57.526]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:03.075]  I was just thinking about the tracking mechanisms that they have available.
[02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:07.200]  Like, for example, they can track you through a lot of driver's licenses now.
[02:01:08.041 --> 02:01:13.947]  If, God forbid, this does turn into a shooting war, it might be a good idea to dump your wallet, so to speak.
[02:01:14.168 --> 02:01:18.492]  Well, all you gotta do is fry the RFID chip that are on them.
[02:01:19.485 --> 02:01:25.628]  But I mean, in the future, you're not going to buy and sell without your face scan approving it, which is just a digital camera.
[02:01:26.569 --> 02:01:27.449]  It's going in everywhere.
[02:01:27.489 --> 02:01:28.710]  They admit that's their plan.
[02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:30.591]  It's always been the plan of this architecture.
[02:01:31.691 --> 02:01:34.453]  And the big thing is piling fees on every transaction.
[02:01:34.473 --> 02:01:38.855]  They're going to have a global sales tax, national sales tax, carbon taxes.
[02:01:39.195 --> 02:01:44.458]  So even when you pay cash, you notice now in Louisiana, they've banned cash for retail sales.
[02:01:44.498 --> 02:01:45.458]  Did you see that last year?
[02:01:45.478 --> 02:01:46.819]  Oh, man.
[02:01:46.939 --> 02:01:48.380]  This is all about control, sir.
[02:01:49.292 --> 02:01:50.212]  Yeah.
[02:01:51.273 --> 02:01:52.253]  Well, yeah, that's true.
[02:01:52.293 --> 02:01:53.093]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:01:53.113 --> 02:02:02.356]  One of the things I wanted to say was that in the early 90s, I was with Sam Sherwood's militia in Idaho and I went in one of his inner circle.
[02:02:02.976 --> 02:02:07.678]  One of the things that was brought to our attention was the method for killing heat signature.
[02:02:08.704 --> 02:02:13.390]  Um, basically, put a space blanket underneath an army poncho.
[02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:16.473]  Theoretically, it's supposed to kill 90% of your heat signature.
[02:02:16.513 --> 02:02:18.015]  God forbid it goes to a shooting war.
[02:02:18.035 --> 02:02:19.777]  That gives the Patriots a hell of an advantage.
[02:02:20.765 --> 02:02:21.445]  No, that's true.
[02:02:21.505 --> 02:02:24.946]  They say you can actually take the space blanket and basically show it in.
[02:02:25.747 --> 02:02:27.147]  There's a lot of other ways to do that.
[02:02:27.167 --> 02:02:30.669]  And that's why the globalists are moving to drones domestically.
[02:02:30.689 --> 02:02:34.810]  I mean, the military has over 20,000 drones, 7,000 plus predators alone.
[02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:37.751]  They're going to the armed systems, the Reapers and others.
[02:02:38.411 --> 02:02:40.432]  And they admit they're going to use them domestically against us.
[02:02:41.512 --> 02:02:45.974]  Again, an illegitimate criminal government overtaken by foreign banks engaging in every crime you can imagine.
[02:02:47.874 --> 02:03:00.093]  Um, and one final thing I'd like to say is that I would suggest that every patriot out there, you know, get right with God, get right with Jesus, because if He is with you, who could possibly be against you?
[02:03:01.431 --> 02:03:04.734]  Well, I agree with that, and also make hay while the sun shines.
[02:03:04.854 --> 02:03:05.954]  Reach out to everybody.
[02:03:05.995 --> 02:03:07.035]  Do banner hangs.
[02:03:07.556 --> 02:03:16.543]  Put InfoWars.com or other websites on the side of your barn, or your house, or your business, or, you know, out there on the side in front of your hamburger joint.
[02:03:16.843 --> 02:03:18.744]  Make copies of my film, Obama Deception.
[02:03:18.784 --> 02:03:19.905]  Follow the Republic in-game.
[02:03:20.185 --> 02:03:26.930]  Give them away free at your restaurant, or at your grocery store, or at your Five and Dime, or at your convenience store, or
[02:03:27.811 --> 02:03:28.932]  Yeah, I loved Endgame.
[02:03:28.952 --> 02:03:32.033]  I never realized how rotten Charles Darwin really was until I saw that.
[02:03:51.772 --> 02:03:57.736]  Well, they took out of what Darwin's whole family was a eugenics family that were all interbreeding to create a master race.
[02:03:58.177 --> 02:04:00.558]  The Galtans, the Wedgwoods, the Huxleys, all of them.
[02:04:01.479 --> 02:04:04.341]  And, of course, it didn't create a master race.
[02:04:04.361 --> 02:04:08.644]  Within four generations, most children were stillborn or seriously and mentally retarded.
[02:04:09.104 --> 02:04:14.128]  But it did create a few idiot savants that did survive, because they did originally come out of very smart families.
[02:04:14.168 --> 02:04:16.530]  But four families all intermarried in the test.
[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:18.010]  I know, I hear ya.
[02:04:29.884 --> 02:04:42.809]  I just wish there was some way, uh, people could, uh, you know, like, say, just pick a day in which they can all, like, at noon, uh, just stick their head out a window and just scream, uh, no new Ron Pauly or something like that.
[02:04:43.249 --> 02:04:47.030]  You know, just make it really known that they don't approve of this Newt Gingrich.
[02:04:49.051 --> 02:04:51.032]  I mean, you know what I mean, don't you?
[02:04:53.193 --> 02:04:54.573]  What do you mean, don't approve of Newt Gingrich?
[02:04:54.593 --> 02:04:55.073]  Absolutely.
[02:04:55.113 --> 02:04:56.374]  I can't stand Newt Gingrich.
[02:04:56.414 --> 02:04:58.255]  I mean, he's a globalist demon.
[02:04:58.275 --> 02:04:58.935]  Appreciate the call.
[02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:03.391]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.431 --> 02:05:08.776]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:09.016 --> 02:05:13.641]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:14.041 --> 02:05:19.066]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:19.606 --> 02:05:24.309]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:26.751]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:05:27.151 --> 02:05:31.754]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:31.934 --> 02:05:32.835]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:33.055 --> 02:05:35.837]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:36.137 --> 02:05:39.439]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:42.602]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:42.942 --> 02:05:44.843]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:45.163 --> 02:05:46.084]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.726 --> 02:05:51.507]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:52.687 --> 02:05:58.470]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:58.790 --> 02:06:01.171]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:01.997 --> 02:06:05.822]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[02:06:06.142 --> 02:06:08.025]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[02:06:08.445 --> 02:06:09.927]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[02:06:10.288 --> 02:06:12.811]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[02:06:13.251 --> 02:06:19.760]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:23.462]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:06:23.482 --> 02:06:28.405]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[02:06:28.705 --> 02:06:29.966]  Your greatest dependency.
[02:06:30.226 --> 02:06:31.287]  Your food supply.
[02:06:31.647 --> 02:06:35.510]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:40.113]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[02:07:05.822 --> 02:07:06.742]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:07.082 --> 02:07:11.004]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:11.024 --> 02:07:13.224]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:13.424 --> 02:07:18.686]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:19.106 --> 02:07:25.388]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:25.788 --> 02:07:31.350]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:35.411]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:35.951 --> 02:07:39.892]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:40.212 --> 02:07:45.714]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:46.174 --> 02:07:49.135]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:49.716 --> 02:07:51.116]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:51.696 --> 02:07:52.196]  It's here.

[02:08:02.381 --> 02:08:07.254]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:07.595 --> 02:08:09.901]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:25.930 --> 02:08:32.995]  Now I know that we've got Julio, John, Jay, Mouselink, Alex, and others, and I'm going to get to all of you before Catherine Albrecht leaves us.
[02:08:33.455 --> 02:08:35.016]  She'll be able to comment on anything you bring up.
[02:08:35.377 --> 02:08:36.878]  She's a talk show host in her own right.
[02:08:37.338 --> 02:08:38.519]  Catherine Albrecht...
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:54.376]  ...is the host of the Dr. Catherine Albrecht Show, and she is a highly effective privacy campaigner, a sought-after public speaker and technology expert, and the author of numerous books and videos, a popular media commentator, and dynamic radio personality.
[02:08:55.157 --> 02:09:09.820]  And she of course came to prominence writing a book about exposing RFID and the tracker systems that basically turns the real world into like a Google search engine where all products have these little tracker systems in them.
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:17.442]  Her unique brand of knowledge coupled with a passion for truth and freedom have earned her a devoted following and she joins us for the rest of the hour.
[02:09:18.042 --> 02:09:21.583]  And we also, again as I said, have your calls there.
[02:09:22.543 --> 02:09:27.844]  But the point is, the internet is obviously just a computer communication system.
[02:09:28.184 --> 02:09:32.525]  But now it's being wired into all your appliances, your television sets, your smartphones.
[02:09:33.646 --> 02:09:37.466]  And it's controlling the architecture of our technological development.
[02:09:37.526 --> 02:09:48.689]  And these global corporations and governments get together on record and conspire to make you pay for Trojan horse surveillance systems in the products you purchase.
[02:09:49.929 --> 02:09:58.031]  And we've gone from government denying that they're spying on us to now just saying, yeah, we're spying on everything.
[02:09:58.411 --> 02:10:00.332]  I mean, you know, take Pennsylvania a few years ago.
[02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.773]  People didn't believe that when it first came out in the mainstream news.
[02:10:03.273 --> 02:10:09.494]  Oh, yeah, the school announced and tattled on themselves the laptops, the free laptops that taxpayers pay for.
[02:10:09.534 --> 02:10:10.035]  Nothing's free.
[02:10:10.655 --> 02:10:11.615]  That we sent home with you.
[02:10:11.655 --> 02:10:13.055]  We're watching you in the shower.
[02:10:13.095 --> 02:10:14.236]  We're watching you in your bed.
[02:10:14.616 --> 02:10:16.256]  We're watching you at home.
[02:10:17.657 --> 02:10:18.397]  We're watching you.
[02:10:19.656 --> 02:10:23.298]  And they sent the police after some kid because they were eating Skittles and thought they were pills.
[02:10:24.119 --> 02:10:27.521]  So, government is announcing more and more on itself.
[02:10:28.642 --> 02:10:36.627]  And the big issue is, the plan is face scanning, thumb printing to buy and sell, part of national and global sales taxes, VAT and carbon tax.
[02:10:36.827 --> 02:10:37.568]  This is all announced.
[02:10:38.248 --> 02:10:40.750]  And then they're going to add fines and fees and other regs.
[02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:43.812]  You think $5 to use your smart card is bad for Bank of America.
[02:10:45.091 --> 02:10:46.012]  Or your debit card.
[02:10:46.432 --> 02:10:46.973]  Just wait.
[02:10:47.414 --> 02:10:48.615]  Everything with RFID.
[02:10:48.735 --> 02:10:49.756]  Everything face scanned.
[02:10:50.096 --> 02:10:50.737]  By law.
[02:10:51.418 --> 02:10:52.419]  Look at Louisiana.
[02:10:52.679 --> 02:10:55.222]  Saying you can't use cash in second hand transactions.
[02:10:55.822 --> 02:10:56.843]  All of you are criminals.
[02:10:56.863 --> 02:10:58.345]  You've got to go to a big box store.
[02:10:58.685 --> 02:11:00.167]  Cracking down the lemonade stands.
[02:11:00.207 --> 02:11:01.188]  The Girl Scout cookies.
[02:11:01.548 --> 02:11:03.010]  Arresting people selling lemonade.
[02:11:04.286 --> 02:11:05.807]  Arresting kids playing tag.
[02:11:06.387 --> 02:11:08.428]  Arresting kids for running on the schoolyard.
[02:11:08.889 --> 02:11:17.994]  Just type it into the search engine, folks, and you will see Associated Press going, you know, is it good to arrest five-year-olds for running on the playground?
[02:11:18.014 --> 02:11:20.315]  I showed it to you last hour.
[02:11:20.435 --> 02:11:21.776]  This is really happening.
[02:11:23.010 --> 02:11:28.534]  And on the backs of all of this just out today, London Guardian Thailand backs Twitter's censorship policy.
[02:11:28.934 --> 02:11:34.118]  The government becomes first to publicly endorse Twitter's decision to permit country-specific censorship of content.
[02:11:34.458 --> 02:11:44.084]  So if the West wants to overthrow their old dictator in Egypt, or another dictator like Assad in Syria, oh, they're all for the rebels that are CIA-funded on record.
[02:11:44.104 --> 02:11:45.445]  I'm not saying I like Syria.
[02:11:45.925 --> 02:11:47.467]  I'm not saying I like Hazi Mubarak.
[02:11:47.967 --> 02:11:49.268]  The point is, is it's selective.
[02:11:49.728 --> 02:11:50.709]  They let them use it.
[02:11:51.502 --> 02:11:56.844]  But then, and criticize Mubarak for shutting it down, but everywhere else they're saying they're going to shut it down.
[02:11:56.864 --> 02:12:02.225]  We've already seen cell phones in San Francisco shut down during protests, so nobody can take photos or shoot video.
[02:12:02.766 --> 02:12:04.366]  We're already seeing calls for this here.
[02:12:04.766 --> 02:12:08.547]  Google's announcing they're going to be helping people censor over the web.
[02:12:09.128 --> 02:12:10.648]  They're announcing you have no privacy now.
[02:12:10.688 --> 02:12:11.788]  They're going to integrate all this.
[02:12:12.209 --> 02:12:14.029]  Katherine Alba is going to be breaking it down with us.
[02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:16.050]  Here's another one.
[02:12:17.162 --> 02:12:18.625]  ACTA is worse than SOPA.
[02:12:18.865 --> 02:12:19.807]  Here's what you need to know.
[02:12:19.827 --> 02:12:23.934]  And it breaks down the fact this global treaty that Obama has now signed.
[02:12:25.898 --> 02:12:28.402]  And Homeland Security is involved in all of that.
[02:12:30.134 --> 02:12:34.797]  So it's all rolling out with the troops on the streets, the surveillance, the cashless society.
[02:12:35.437 --> 02:12:38.499]  That is about shutting you down if you're not a good globalist.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.742]  Shutting down black markets once you've had your bank account shut down.
[02:12:43.503 --> 02:12:45.224]  It's all about targeting everyone.
[02:12:45.264 --> 02:12:47.745]  It's all about a managed, controlled economy.
[02:12:48.046 --> 02:12:51.107]  And Dr. Catherine Albrecht joins us to break this down.
[02:12:51.147 --> 02:12:54.550]  I mean, Catherine, what we're seeing is everything come out in the open.
[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:59.253]  From the NDAA, to the wars, to the torture, to the police state.
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:03.323]  We are seeing the censorship come out in the open.
[02:13:04.063 --> 02:13:09.027]  We're seeing the fact that Al-Qaeda is being protected and put in power in Libya by Western powers.
[02:13:09.528 --> 02:13:11.589]  Everything is pretty much coming out right now.
[02:13:12.010 --> 02:13:15.833]  That's panicking the system in this open free information society.
[02:13:16.153 --> 02:13:18.795]  The mainstream media is dying.
[02:13:19.076 --> 02:13:24.060]  So it's a perfect storm of the old dying media and corrupt governments knowing that we're awake to them.
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:32.030]  Wanting now to try to put the genie back in the bottle, and their attempt to shut down our free speech has really, I think, backfired.
[02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.411]  Catherine Albrecht, thank you for joining us.
[02:13:33.792 --> 02:13:37.376]  Hey, it's great to be on, Alex, and you totally hit the nail on the head.
[02:13:37.416 --> 02:13:43.424]  In fact, this whole thing out of Thailand, they actually wanted to put an all-out block on all social media from the West.
[02:13:44.093 --> 02:13:46.255]  And we're citing China as a good example to follow.
[02:13:46.335 --> 02:13:59.304]  So obviously if Thailand and China and Iran, I know you reported on this a couple years ago when it happened, when they had those riots in the street and were shooting protesters, they told all the journalists, get lost, we don't want any journalists in here, they cordoned it off.
[02:13:59.884 --> 02:14:06.170]  And people were taking photos, posting them on the web from their smartphones, and getting right around that.
[02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:10.555]  So that's why they want to put these kind of filters onto all of these websites.
[02:14:10.855 --> 02:14:13.217]  And those countries, they come out and say it openly.
[02:14:13.237 --> 02:14:19.003]  You know, you look at China and you say, all right, well China's going to come right out and say, you have no freedom.
[02:14:19.843 --> 02:14:21.144]  You can't just do whatever you want.
[02:14:21.444 --> 02:14:23.485]  North Korea is a perfect example.
[02:14:24.045 --> 02:14:28.448]  And what you're pointing out is that our government now is starting to do the same thing.
[02:14:28.748 --> 02:14:33.651]  The things that used to be whispered about and considered conspiracy theory are now openly published.
[02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:34.971]  They're open statements.
[02:14:34.991 --> 02:14:36.032]  They're open policies.
[02:14:36.512 --> 02:14:38.733]  Same thing is true, obviously, with the search engines.
[02:14:38.793 --> 02:14:43.736]  You've got Google and Yahoo and Bing, which for years, if you were over in Beijing,
[02:14:44.156 --> 02:14:49.982]  And you typed in Tiananmen Square because you wanted to find out about the massacre but you were behind the walls of China?
[02:14:50.463 --> 02:14:51.264]  You would not get.
[02:14:51.284 --> 02:14:57.330]  Those search engines would actually censor your results and only show you happy families picnicking in the park.
[02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:59.873]  And so from behind that iron wall of China,
[02:15:00.393 --> 02:15:02.834]  You could not even discover that there had been a massacre.
[02:15:03.255 --> 02:15:03.515]  Why?
[02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:17.262]  Because all the information that we get nowadays, we're getting through the search engines, we're getting through these big companies, and all it takes is for one government to get three or four of them to say, yeah, we'll all get on board, and we'll shut down and censor your information.
[02:15:17.942 --> 02:15:20.365]  And we could be back to the dark ages.
[02:15:20.565 --> 02:15:27.432]  I mean, we could be worse than Soviet Stalin, Soviet Union, where there was only one source of information.
[02:15:27.753 --> 02:15:30.976]  Notice Russia is now endorsing a bunch of internet censorship.
[02:15:31.577 --> 02:15:37.043]  So all these governments, who are more and more getting exposed, they have a dog in the fight.
[02:15:37.583 --> 02:15:37.783]  We're
[02:16:00.749 --> 02:16:10.962]  They may shut down the whole web and only direct you to White House website where you get a message so they can control information during emergencies or during a new war.
[02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:15.769]  The point is they're openly trying to sell this idea of censorship now.
[02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:18.111]  Not just of the Internet, but of talk radio.
[02:16:18.451 --> 02:16:25.418]  Cass Sunstein, the regulations are, as you know, Catherine, has called for censoring people that don't believe in man-made global warming.
[02:16:25.838 --> 02:16:32.684]  I mean, they are really authoritarians, and I think it's starting to backfire on them that they're being so obvious.
[02:16:33.205 --> 02:16:34.166]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[02:16:34.446 --> 02:16:38.249]  And, you know, I was just talking on my show recently about this article that came out.
[02:16:38.409 --> 02:16:41.032]  Should Google take the crazy off of the Internet?
[02:16:41.861 --> 02:16:58.241]  And somebody actually came out and said with a straight face that, and this was like in Forbes, so you know this is not just some guy's blog, but came out and said, we really think that Google should start flagging websites that don't meet basic criterion of accepted scientific fact.
[02:16:58.281 --> 02:17:01.085]  And they were talking about creation websites, they were talking about
[02:17:01.305 --> 02:17:12.212]  9-11 truth websites, they were talking about Obama birth certificate concern websites and you know political type issues and saying that first Google should start off by putting a little flag and saying these are not
[02:17:12.745 --> 02:17:17.568]  You know, vetted by Google, or these are not approved websites, or these are crazy websites.
[02:17:17.988 --> 02:17:24.793]  And then, of course, your next step, I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see, your next step from that is going to be saying, well, let's just make sure those aren't even there.
[02:17:24.813 --> 02:17:26.514]  Well, they've said that.
[02:17:26.594 --> 02:17:31.057]  I mean, Google's already delisted us two years ago from their Google News function.
[02:17:31.417 --> 02:17:36.421]  You guys got kind of some screwage there on YouTube, too, not long ago.
[02:17:36.441 --> 02:17:38.042]  Yeah, we've had all sorts of stuff.
[02:17:38.082 --> 02:17:44.647]  I mean, Paul Watson's been in areas of Europe and in England, and they have the government-free Wi-Fi at the train stations.
[02:17:45.128 --> 02:17:47.249]  InfoWars and Prison Planet hasn't noticed.
[02:17:48.211 --> 02:17:49.032]  This is extreme.
[02:17:49.052 --> 02:17:49.973]  You're not allowed to go there.
[02:17:50.614 --> 02:17:51.175]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:51.876 --> 02:18:04.293]  So, yeah, and this is why, you know, the last week, of course, last week, Google made its big announcement that it's going to take all of its products, all 60 of its privacy policies, 60 plus privacy policies, consolidate them into one.
[02:18:05.013 --> 02:18:10.436]  And, you know, you look around, and I'm just working on an essay called, When Did Google Become a Verb?
[02:18:10.777 --> 02:18:18.681]  You know, we are all unthinkingly logging onto this website and doing much more than we realize we're doing by using these services.
[02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:23.184]  I have some friends who are in the privacy movement, who are in the freedom movement, who use Google Voice.
[02:18:23.704 --> 02:18:25.466]  I'm like, dudes, have you read the privacy policy?
[02:18:25.486 --> 02:18:31.251]  Do you realize that that service is recording every phone call you make, every one of your contacts?
[02:18:31.291 --> 02:18:34.534]  Google email admits that they read your email and store it.
[02:18:34.895 --> 02:18:35.295]  You got it.
[02:18:35.315 --> 02:18:37.397]  You got it.
[02:18:37.417 --> 02:18:39.039]  So this is, I think it's interesting.
[02:18:39.059 --> 02:18:40.220]  This is a good time.
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:42.962]  And I know everybody says, what are you talking about, Kathryn?
[02:18:42.982 --> 02:18:43.463]  It's the worst.
[02:18:43.503 --> 02:18:48.748]  But I say, this is a good time because this is the first time, Alex, that the kinds of things you and I have been talking about
[02:18:49.088 --> 02:18:54.793]  And I know you even go back before I do, because you were one of the folks who helped wake me up back in 1999 when I became an advocate.
[02:18:55.233 --> 02:19:03.239]  So, you know, those of us who've been saying this for over a decade, you know, we are now no longer people crying in the wilderness.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:04.861]  We are now the mainstream.
[02:19:04.921 --> 02:19:11.806]  We are now the people saying, hey, all of you out there who are concerned about this, this is what we've been talking about all along, and wake up.
[02:19:11.886 --> 02:19:13.628]  And they're waking up in droves.
[02:19:14.188 --> 02:19:18.171]  So, you know, this whole Google thing, and as your listeners probably know, I work with Startpage.
[02:19:18.411 --> 02:19:20.832]  Startpage.com, which is the private alternative to Google.
[02:19:21.313 --> 02:19:27.576]  You know, looking at what the Internet is all about right now, and saying, okay, how do we support alternatives?
[02:19:27.617 --> 02:19:32.940]  How do we get alternatives like Startpage, you know, that serves you Google results without the tracking?
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:34.440]  How do we do that for everything?
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.501]  And, you know, we're working on StartMail.com, a Gmail equivalent.
[02:19:38.701 --> 02:19:40.422]  I would love to see equivalent browsers.
[02:19:40.522 --> 02:19:42.402]  I'd love to see an equivalent internet, to be honest.
[02:19:42.462 --> 02:19:43.602]  Well, that's the answer.
[02:19:43.622 --> 02:19:48.063]  I mean, just like people demanded organic foods in the last 15 years, and now we have that alternative.
[02:19:48.463 --> 02:19:50.984]  We have to vote with our dollars and vote with where we go.
[02:19:51.564 --> 02:19:54.044]  And yeah, IxQuik, which is, of course, StartPage.
[02:19:54.705 --> 02:19:59.926]  You've also got Jabiru and HideMy... I'm not going to say it on air.
[02:20:00.706 --> 02:20:01.466]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:02.483 --> 02:20:09.666]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[02:21:03.376 --> 02:21:08.738]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:08.978 --> 02:21:13.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:14.380]  It's true.
[02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:19.022]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:21:19.562 --> 02:21:24.264]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:21:49.682 --> 02:21:51.424]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:03.021 --> 02:22:06.602]  Has the United States been discovered in the Bible?
[02:22:06.682 --> 02:22:08.962]  Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[02:22:09.182 --> 02:22:11.683]  Is the New World Order world government?

[02:23:52.916 --> 02:24:08.702]  Alright, right back to privacy expert Dr. Kathryn Albrecht.
[02:24:09.843 --> 02:24:11.283]  Short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:11.864 --> 02:24:13.044]  Kathryn, this is a short seg.
[02:24:13.084 --> 02:24:14.425]  You've got the floor here.
[02:24:14.865 --> 02:24:22.188]  What are some of the other threats we see developing and the unification of how all these spy systems are tied in together?
[02:24:23.203 --> 02:24:30.425]  Well, you know, the Internet, Alex, as anybody who's been watching it for the last 15 years, has become the backbone of virtually everything we do.
[02:24:30.985 --> 02:24:35.646]  And, you know, it's not just the Internet, it's the fact that our phone calls are now being routed through it.
[02:24:35.706 --> 02:24:37.946]  You've got lots of people using voice over IP.
[02:24:38.106 --> 02:24:41.967]  You've got, essentially, this data cloud that's also being created.
[02:24:42.367 --> 02:24:45.088]  And all of the stuff that we do is about to wind up on the Internet.
[02:24:45.168 --> 02:24:50.149]  And I think that's why, like, Google's announcement is so interesting, because Sergey Brin, back in the founding of Google,
[02:24:51.069 --> 02:24:55.653]  Or after the founding of Google, a couple years ago, was asked, you know, what do you envision Google becoming?
[02:24:55.673 --> 02:24:57.075]  You know, what's the ultimate search engine?
[02:24:57.095 --> 02:24:59.417]  And his answer was, like the mind of God.
[02:25:00.277 --> 02:25:15.511]  And, you know, you put all that together and you say, okay, so we are creating essentially, and you and I have talked about this before on the show, we're creating a kind of a backbone or a nervous system across this planet, and I've said this before, it's not accidental that we call it the net.
[02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:17.231]  You know, a net traps things.
[02:25:17.651 --> 02:25:18.492]  It's not accidental.
[02:25:18.512 --> 02:25:21.273]  We call it a web because a web traps things.
[02:25:21.373 --> 02:25:30.039]  We are creating, if you could stand in outer space and see all of the interconnected links of information flow across this planet, it would look an awful lot like a net or a web.
[02:25:30.459 --> 02:25:33.280]  And the things that ultimately are going to be caught in that are us.
[02:25:33.961 --> 02:25:40.285]  And so as these things consolidate, you know, I was just rereading 1896, King Camp Gillette.
[02:25:40.385 --> 02:25:40.825]  What a name.
[02:25:40.845 --> 02:25:45.608]  His parents named him King, the guy who created the Gillette razor company.
[02:25:46.861 --> 02:25:56.544]  He was the first, by the way, back in 1896, back in the 1800s, he was the first guy to come up with a disposable consumer product, which is fascinating to me because now virtually everything you buy is disposable.
[02:25:56.584 --> 02:25:58.204]  And he was the guy who created that.
[02:25:58.564 --> 02:26:06.166]  Prior to that, everybody had a straight razor and they sharpened it with a strop and you get one when you came of age, you make another one when you got married and that was it for life.
[02:26:06.226 --> 02:26:07.027]  You had one razor.
[02:26:07.347 --> 02:26:11.088]  And so he came up with this disposable concept that now has polluted our whole planet.
[02:26:12.128 --> 02:26:23.672]  But one of the things that he was working on back then was this idea that, left to its own devices, capitalism was going to lead to one single store, one single manufacturer for everything.
[02:26:23.732 --> 02:26:27.433]  He was basically talking about communism, socialism, you know, the central control.
[02:26:28.054 --> 02:26:31.175]  And when I was looking at that, I was thinking, well, so that's Walmart.
[02:26:31.295 --> 02:26:34.856]  You know, back in 1896, this Gillette guy was predicting Walmart.
[02:26:35.456 --> 02:26:41.482]  Well, he didn't have the ability to do it yet, but he could have been predicting Google, because it's the same concept.
[02:26:41.522 --> 02:26:50.291]  You've got, in the same way that Walmart is like how people buy stuff nowadays, and has the power to snuff out other companies and eliminate competition, and, you know, I
[02:26:50.911 --> 02:27:07.103]  Report on this a couple years ago in England some commentator on the on the supermarket industry said England is too big for three supermarkets We're gonna have to get it down to two and eventually one so everything's moving to this hugeness consolidation and We're gonna start seeing the same thing on the internet.
[02:27:07.123 --> 02:27:11.126]  We're already seeing it You know I remember back in the 90s when I was a graduate student at Harvard and
[02:27:11.606 --> 02:27:14.447]  And we were like the first people to ever use the Internet.
[02:27:14.487 --> 02:27:15.087]  It was new.
[02:27:15.107 --> 02:27:16.567]  It was not graphical.
[02:27:16.668 --> 02:27:17.388]  It was all text.
[02:27:17.448 --> 02:27:18.768]  It was, you know, hard to navigate.
[02:27:19.028 --> 02:27:20.088]  And we were like, how cool!
[02:27:20.509 --> 02:27:23.849]  You know, there's a million people on here and they're all doing their own thing.
[02:27:24.350 --> 02:27:29.031]  Now you go on the Internet and virtually everything is under these couple of few umbrellas, as you well know.
[02:27:29.671 --> 02:27:41.440]  So, that's why I think alternative radio, I think supporting InfoWars, supporting what I'm doing over at my radio show at KatherineAlbrecht.com, supporting all of the alternative sources of news is going to be crucial.
[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:51.688]  And in the same way, when you start looking, and again I think the reason everybody got scared about this Google announcement, is all of a sudden you've got them pulling tight the reins.
[02:27:51.768 --> 02:27:56.231]  It's like the net was sort of loosely kind of being built around us, we didn't realize it, and now they're pulling it.
[02:27:56.471 --> 02:27:57.872]  And that was always the plan.
[02:27:57.972 --> 02:28:00.133]  Make it ubiquitous, get it into everything.
[02:28:00.533 --> 02:28:03.535]  Standardize the TVs, everything where they're plugged in.
[02:28:04.015 --> 02:28:09.319]  The smart meters spying on what you're doing in your house off of algorithms.
[02:28:10.099 --> 02:28:14.842]  I mean it's all now just suddenly admitted and then Google says we're going to integrate
[02:28:15.945 --> 02:28:24.451]  All the platforms we have and share what you're doing with everyone and Schmidt comes out and says, you shouldn't be doing it if you don't want people to know.
[02:28:24.892 --> 02:28:25.412]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:28:25.452 --> 02:28:29.655]  I close my blinds at night because I want privacy or I don't want the sunlight coming in.
[02:28:30.736 --> 02:28:34.098]  It doesn't mean I should live in a glass house because you say so.
[02:28:34.459 --> 02:28:38.061]  And he operated for 12 years like don't be evil.
[02:28:38.301 --> 02:28:40.203]  We'll always keep your data secret.
[02:28:40.623 --> 02:28:42.044]  We've never had a data breach.
[02:28:42.104 --> 02:28:43.544]  We promise we won't do that.
[02:28:43.884 --> 02:28:45.585]  And now, they're going, you know what?
[02:28:45.625 --> 02:28:46.485]  We are evil.
[02:28:46.545 --> 02:28:47.566]  We always planned it.
[02:28:47.766 --> 02:28:48.586]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:28:48.846 --> 02:28:49.827]  We're taking over.
[02:28:50.327 --> 02:28:52.908]  And it just shows, like I said a few weeks ago when SOPA
[02:28:54.011 --> 02:28:54.892]  I was getting shot down.
[02:28:54.932 --> 02:29:03.481]  I said, that's good, but it's only because the big mega-globalists like Google, they're already going to implement a global model through Davos and other systems.
[02:29:03.521 --> 02:29:06.303]  They don't want governments ham-fistedly doing it.
[02:29:06.363 --> 02:29:13.851]  They don't want the recording industry coming in with something that screws up their more subtle ways to phase in censorship.
[02:29:13.871 --> 02:29:16.273]  They're like, wait a minute, don't run off all the geese.
[02:29:16.934 --> 02:29:22.136]  We're going to put them all in one big net and catch all of them, not shoot one with a shotgun, recording industry.
[02:29:22.597 --> 02:29:23.677]  Shut up, you idiots!
[02:29:24.137 --> 02:29:24.658]  Sit down!
[02:29:24.698 --> 02:29:26.238]  We're going to show you how you censor.
[02:29:26.518 --> 02:29:27.979]  We're going to show you how it's done.
[02:29:28.419 --> 02:29:29.080]  Catherine, stay there.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:33.161]  We're going to come right back at more of your views on that and how we stop these folks.
[02:29:33.181 --> 02:29:39.284]  And absolutely, it is the highest rated of the search engines that don't spy on you.
[02:29:39.304 --> 02:29:42.746]  Startpage.com, another subsidiary of Ixquik.
[02:29:43.426 --> 02:29:51.391]  Uh, and I guess that's the European name for it, and there's some others out there, but we've all got to stop using the term Google as the word for search engine.
[02:29:51.411 --> 02:29:52.252]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.752 --> 02:29:54.373]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.294 --> 02:29:57.956]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:08.003]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:09.203 --> 02:30:13.965]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:14.346 --> 02:30:21.369]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:25.371]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:27.152 --> 02:30:29.473]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:41.234 --> 02:30:43.095]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:43.375 --> 02:30:44.875]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:45.155 --> 02:30:47.716]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:48.036 --> 02:30:52.077]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:30:52.277 --> 02:30:54.298]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:54.658 --> 02:30:56.879]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:57.359 --> 02:30:58.779]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:58.939 --> 02:30:59.399]  Got it.
[02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:00.600]  Others don't.
[02:31:01.786 --> 02:31:06.009]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:06.329 --> 02:31:06.609]  Number 1.
[02:31:07.250 --> 02:31:10.392]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.672 --> 02:31:11.232]  Number 2.
[02:31:11.533 --> 02:31:16.096]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.416 --> 02:31:16.876]  It's true.
[02:31:17.176 --> 02:31:21.719]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:22.580]  Number 3.
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:26.142]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:26.442 --> 02:31:30.145]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:30.345 --> 02:31:30.906]  Number 4.
[02:31:31.146 --> 02:31:33.508]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.908 --> 02:31:37.291]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:38.132]  Number 5.
[02:31:38.372 --> 02:31:42.295]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:42.536 --> 02:31:47.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:51.605]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.745 --> 02:31:53.307]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:53.527 --> 02:31:55.610]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:58.133]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:02.711 --> 02:32:04.213]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:04.433 --> 02:32:09.459]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:09.739 --> 02:32:11.101]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:11.281 --> 02:32:20.071]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:20.792 --> 02:32:27.896]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:28.316 --> 02:32:35.940]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:41.242]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:41.563 --> 02:32:43.724]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:46.485 --> 02:32:49.409]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:52.013]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:52.033 --> 02:32:54.216]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:33:28.754 --> 02:33:37.337]  Listen folks, I get up here like a machine gun and just rattle through all the crimes the globalists are committing and cover all the different facets of it, but it's real.
[02:33:38.348 --> 02:33:42.509]  There are powerful interests that want monopolies, that want to control your life.
[02:33:43.689 --> 02:33:49.910]  Who will give billions of dollars to their buddies' companies to never build a single, you know, alternative energy system.
[02:33:50.350 --> 02:33:51.611]  Because they never intended to.
[02:33:51.691 --> 02:33:58.132]  Who will shut down power plants in your area so their power plant that's in with the government will make ten times the money.
[02:34:00.612 --> 02:34:07.994]  Where they'll shut down a pipeline bringing us oil so that Warren Buffett can ship it by train to the coast to send it to China.
[02:34:09.451 --> 02:34:23.359]  And then Warren Buffett pays the news media, on record, Aaron was pointing this out to me yesterday, to put out PR stories about what a philanthropist he is, when he actually put his money in a tax-free foundation and makes money off of it.
[02:34:24.719 --> 02:34:29.102]  And they're buying up big pharma companies, vaccines, Bill Gates is involved with him.
[02:34:30.582 --> 02:34:33.164]  It is beyond out of control.
[02:34:34.648 --> 02:34:43.493]  And Internet, too, going back 12 years ago, this consortium would meet and admit it's going to be big business, academia, and government.
[02:34:43.953 --> 02:34:50.756]  They're going to control the new Internet, and they're going to make you sign agreements to be on their platforms, and then they can shut you down anytime they want.
[02:34:51.317 --> 02:34:52.357]  It's the privacy agreements.
[02:34:52.877 --> 02:34:53.758]  It's the terms of use.
[02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:57.520]  And they own what you're doing.
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.700]  You waive all your rights.
[02:34:59.481 --> 02:35:01.522]  And the old web is just shut down.
[02:35:02.489 --> 02:35:11.757]  Now, a way to boil it down is you hear about net neutrality, where companies say you've got to pay us to go over our routers, even though you're already paying for the internet connection.
[02:35:13.078 --> 02:35:20.205]  So, this is about getting the whole world economy wired into this, letting it be free for a while, and then coming in and taking it over.
[02:35:20.605 --> 02:35:22.467]  It's like toll road companies letting you build big
[02:35:27.202 --> 02:35:28.643]  Highways with taxpayer money.
[02:35:28.703 --> 02:35:30.164]  The gas tax is paying for it all.
[02:35:30.505 --> 02:35:32.426]  They call it privatization, but it's not really.
[02:35:32.766 --> 02:35:44.255]  They hand it over, even though it's still government-financed, to a private management company that then puts a new lane on it with paint and technically says, well, now we're allowed to put a toll road on it.
[02:35:44.956 --> 02:35:47.197]  Even though the laws say you can't toll existing roads.
[02:35:47.958 --> 02:35:49.920]  So they're just hijacking our infrastructure.
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:52.582]  This is what the IMF and World Bank have done in the third world.
[02:35:52.642 --> 02:35:53.482]  It's now coming here.
[02:35:53.783 --> 02:35:55.384]  Look at the austerity in Europe.
[02:35:55.904 --> 02:35:59.727]  Look at Europe signing on to this new internet censorship treaty.
[02:36:01.969 --> 02:36:02.530]  The ACTA.
[02:36:04.351 --> 02:36:11.216]  Look at how they're announcing that they're going to raise everybody's taxes to, quote, pay off the debt, but most of the debt isn't even the people's own debt.
[02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:15.200]  The debt is
[02:36:16.693 --> 02:36:17.974]  Incurred by the megabanks.
[02:36:20.195 --> 02:36:26.819]  Catherine, does it ever make your head spin just to see the enormity of this planned economy unfolding?
[02:36:28.235 --> 02:36:28.536]  It is.
[02:36:28.956 --> 02:36:30.417]  It can be a little overwhelming, doesn't it?
[02:36:31.418 --> 02:36:32.819]  It can leave you a little bit stunned.
[02:36:32.939 --> 02:36:39.264]  And, you know, I always try to encourage people, though, because it can be so easy to just say, ah, it's too much.
[02:36:39.404 --> 02:36:40.165]  We can't fight back.
[02:36:40.205 --> 02:36:41.186]  There's nothing we can do.
[02:36:41.666 --> 02:36:49.052]  And then I take a look, and one of the things that's really encouraged me in the last probably decade or so has been the natural foods market.
[02:36:49.372 --> 02:36:51.154]  You know, just organic foods.
[02:36:51.434 --> 02:36:54.959]  If you just think about that alone, and obviously that's just one tiny little sliver.
[02:36:55.399 --> 02:37:05.391]  But there was a time, you know, 10-15 years ago, when those of us who were saying, wait a minute, they're putting all this garbage, and there's hydrogenated vegetable oil, and corn syrup, and it's all in our food, and everybody's getting sick.
[02:37:05.951 --> 02:37:22.540]  And then, little by little, the activists, the people telling their friends, the listeners like your listeners, sending emails and distributing your information, getting the word out, created a grassroots movement that has now made the organics market the fastest moving food market in the country today.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.502]  So, obviously that's just one sliver, but
[02:37:26.082 --> 02:37:44.362]  I encourage people not to give up and not to lose heart because there are projects that people have been working on for you know three four years and they say it's not getting anywhere we're not getting any traction and then you look up and you go wait a minute whoa things are changing so don't don't lose hope and I think the key thing and this is why I think the internet is where this whole fight
[02:37:44.902 --> 02:37:46.103]  Really comes together.
[02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:56.929]  You know, you can talk Agenda 21, you can talk toll roads, you can talk North American Union, you can talk all this stuff, but where the crux really is, is this Internet, this ability to communicate.
[02:37:57.049 --> 02:38:03.073]  Because if they can shut that off, if they can keep us from communicating, if they can censor, watch and filter us,
[02:38:03.613 --> 02:38:10.556]  And make sure that you can't even log on to send an email without a thumbprint that puts you through some FBI computer that makes sure you're pre-approved.
[02:38:11.276 --> 02:38:17.839]  If we can't communicate with each other at that point, then anything they want to do is going to be doable.
[02:38:18.299 --> 02:38:30.884]  So the key, and this is why I'm such a huge supporter of your radio program, it's why I do radio, it's why I encourage people, use startpage.com, get a private email address,
[02:38:31.284 --> 02:38:35.585]  Pay attention, because, and don't just fall into the easiness trap.
[02:38:35.625 --> 02:38:45.606]  You know, it's really easy to just flip on and listen to, you know, whatever mainstream media is blathering out on your car radio, if you don't take the time to try to find some real radio.
[02:38:45.686 --> 02:38:50.827]  It's really easy to just use whatever default search engine is on your browser, which is going to be Google.
[02:38:51.127 --> 02:38:51.708]  It's simple.
[02:38:52.168 --> 02:39:00.229]  It's hard to say, let me find Alex Jones, let me listen to Katherine Albrecht, let me find starpage.com, let me make those switches.
[02:39:00.709 --> 02:39:05.796]  And the thing I liken it to, Alex, do you remember back when there was really nothing but Microsoft Word?
[02:39:05.956 --> 02:39:07.378]  That's all you had was just Microsoft.
[02:39:07.879 --> 02:39:13.406]  And everybody all of a sudden started typing in Times New Roman 12 point font, like overnight.
[02:39:14.347 --> 02:39:16.109]  Like everybody just used that one font.
[02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:18.272]  Because those were the default settings.
[02:39:19.113 --> 02:39:25.118]  And this is kind of a phrase that I use a lot, just in my own work, is I think, alright, what are the default settings?
[02:39:25.278 --> 02:39:29.141]  The default setting is what you're always talking about with different language.
[02:39:29.381 --> 02:39:43.552]  You know, you're born, you go to K-12, you do 12,000 hours of public school, government school seat time to be indoctrinated, and then you go to your college or your whatever job, and then you retire, and you pay your taxes, and that's the end of you.
[02:39:43.952 --> 02:39:47.115]  And meanwhile, you're being watched, controlled, manipulated, and used.
[02:39:47.495 --> 02:39:48.896]  And that's the default setting.
[02:39:49.236 --> 02:39:51.316]  Other people are finding ways to switch that off.
[02:39:51.457 --> 02:39:52.637]  Let's homeschool our kids.
[02:39:53.057 --> 02:39:56.558]  Let's take an alternative way of getting through the education system.
[02:39:56.598 --> 02:39:58.799]  Let's take an alternative way of finding out information.
[02:39:58.819 --> 02:40:03.501]  Let's find an alternative way of searching the internet, or sending email, or making phone calls, or whatever it is.
[02:40:04.001 --> 02:40:08.143]  And it's really turning off those default settings and being conscious about it.
[02:40:08.503 --> 02:40:10.144]  And let me tell you, people are ready.
[02:40:11.524 --> 02:40:13.265]  Organic is an alternative.
[02:40:13.385 --> 02:40:14.745]  Organic food is an alternative.
[02:40:14.845 --> 02:40:16.146]  And that's the secret, because
[02:40:16.986 --> 02:40:19.628]  Sure, 15 years ago you couldn't find organic food anywhere.
[02:40:19.708 --> 02:40:23.150]  People put pressure on the system, and so it created an economy.
[02:40:23.531 --> 02:40:33.437]  Now the establishment has created subgroups and clones of Kraft and the rest of it that masquerade as true organic, but people now get wise to that.
[02:40:33.457 --> 02:40:35.579]  I mean, this is an ongoing fight.
[02:40:36.039 --> 02:40:44.521]  And it's the same thing with the standardization at Disney World or SeaWorld or now to get library books to biometrically scan you.
[02:40:44.541 --> 02:41:00.325]  We've just got to learn to say no because once that's standardized, now they're going to do it where you have to do that to buy and sell in their own words so they can put taxes and regulations on you like the $5 to use your ATM card at Bank of America.
[02:41:00.805 --> 02:41:04.386]  They were going to set the standard industry-wide but had to back off.
[02:41:04.446 --> 02:41:05.106]  Take SOPA.
[02:41:05.626 --> 02:41:14.152]  That shows the power we've got, and where we really learn how much the system really wants, the power grab, is in what they always ask for up front.
[02:41:14.493 --> 02:41:24.420]  Take about a year ago, the Cyber Security Command, already in place and running under NORTHCOM, admitted, we want all IT professionals certified by the federal government... I remember that!
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:29.243]  And working for us and even small internet companies in small towns.
[02:41:29.543 --> 02:41:31.164]  We have to have our hubs in there.
[02:41:31.504 --> 02:41:32.644]  You have to work for us.
[02:41:32.684 --> 02:41:33.945]  You have to sign all these agreements.
[02:41:34.285 --> 02:41:37.687]  I mean, they want a total authoritarian control grid.
[02:41:38.067 --> 02:41:38.928]  And let's not forget...
[02:41:39.688 --> 02:41:49.698]  Google, Microsoft especially, but Yahoo, all of them, Sun Microsystems, Cisco, they helped build the great electronic firewall of China.
[02:41:50.059 --> 02:41:52.521]  They helped build what's going in worldwide.
[02:41:52.581 --> 02:41:53.722]  They know how to censor.
[02:41:54.123 --> 02:41:55.584]  And so they're now attempting this.
[02:41:55.624 --> 02:41:58.807]  So people better use the free web.
[02:41:59.688 --> 02:42:03.451]  To fight for its future, but to also fight like it's not going to be here.
[02:42:03.712 --> 02:42:07.495]  You see, folks, everything is accelerating in this phase.
[02:42:07.595 --> 02:42:09.297]  Everything is quickening right now.
[02:42:09.657 --> 02:42:15.282]  The wars, the tyranny, the checkpoints, the TSA are now announcing they're going to be in the airport parking lots.
[02:42:15.622 --> 02:42:17.424]  I told you it'd first be at the concourse.
[02:42:17.964 --> 02:42:21.325]  You know, then in the parking lots, now at your shopping malls, that's starting.
[02:42:21.345 --> 02:42:24.006]  They're going to be at the Super Bowl groping people.
[02:42:24.346 --> 02:42:26.766]  They're training your local police, highway checkpoints.
[02:42:27.066 --> 02:42:28.727]  I mean, it's all here.
[02:42:29.167 --> 02:42:30.727]  It's all happening.
[02:42:30.947 --> 02:42:41.810]  And, Catherine, what do you see unfolding as this awakening accelerates and the tyrants realize we're waking up and try to rush in to block us and accelerate their incremental plan?
[02:42:42.369 --> 02:42:52.020]  Well, you know, we have an interesting window right now, Alex, because we have more ability to organize and communicate now than any people at any time in the past ever in all of human history.
[02:42:52.580 --> 02:43:03.653]  And I think that the, as you call them, the globalists, the people who want to shut all this down, they are hoping beyond hope that we do not actually collectively recognize the power that we have before they can get rid of it.
[02:43:04.273 --> 02:43:05.613]  I really do believe that that is what's happening.
[02:43:05.633 --> 02:43:05.953]  No, that's it.
[02:43:06.013 --> 02:43:06.494]  Exactly.
[02:43:06.574 --> 02:43:16.176]  We either recognize our power and use it, or be slaves in a technocratic, technotronic system that they call it a scientific dictatorship.
[02:43:16.296 --> 02:43:18.696]  They call it an authoritarian system.
[02:43:18.936 --> 02:43:30.579]  The Economist magazine, Newsweek, Time, every day I see articles where the establishment mouthpieces are saying, Catherine, tyranny is good, the experts are going to run things, it won't be a Mussolini,
[02:43:30.939 --> 02:43:32.540]  Or a Hitler in a clown outfit.
[02:43:32.901 --> 02:43:36.123]  It's going to be ruled by these corporate globalist bureaucrats.
[02:43:36.423 --> 02:43:37.464]  Let me get your take on that.
[02:43:37.964 --> 02:43:39.606]  But then I want to give you some Bill Gates news.
[02:43:40.566 --> 02:43:41.187]  Bill Gates news.
[02:43:41.247 --> 02:43:41.427]  All right.
[02:43:41.447 --> 02:43:45.390]  Well, I'm always up for that because he's an interesting character and player in all of this.
[02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:46.511]  Yeah.
[02:43:46.871 --> 02:43:47.571]  The key thing.
[02:43:47.732 --> 02:43:49.433]  And again, I keep coming back to the same point.
[02:43:49.873 --> 02:43:52.135]  We've got to take the tools that we have and hang on to them.
[02:43:52.715 --> 02:43:55.976]  With both hands, kicking and screaming, to not let go of them.
[02:43:55.996 --> 02:44:12.080]  That's why the whole SOPA protest, regardless of whether it was the corporate guys doing it, I think it sent a message to the general public that, wait a minute, so there is a power game going on, and we can use the internet to stop something that seems more powerful, like, you know, basically Congress.
[02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:17.962]  So, the SOPA thing was a beautiful experience, I think, for us nationally as a nation,
[02:44:18.482 --> 02:44:21.904]  Of people who want freedom to say, oh wait a minute, so things can change.
[02:44:22.004 --> 02:44:27.166]  And I want people to grab a hold of that, even if you don't like the companies that did it, or the websites that did it, it doesn't matter.
[02:44:27.526 --> 02:44:34.509]  The reality is that that was a perfect example of the internet coming together, coalescing, and what is the internet basically other than us?
[02:44:35.009 --> 02:44:40.773]  Coming together and coalescing, collectively putting their foot down and saying, heck no, you're not going to do whatever it is.
[02:44:41.033 --> 02:44:41.593]  Well, that's it.
[02:44:41.753 --> 02:44:42.054]  That's it.
[02:44:42.094 --> 02:44:43.655]  But the Internet is even more than that.
[02:44:44.075 --> 02:44:48.558]  It is the future architecture of commerce and of all technological systems.
[02:44:48.638 --> 02:44:54.842]  It is the integrated high-tech society and they're trying to twist the architecture into total control.
[02:44:55.402 --> 02:44:58.483]  Well, and this is why I got a couple of things I want to recommend.
[02:44:58.563 --> 02:44:59.423]  People use cash.
[02:45:00.084 --> 02:45:01.104]  Use it or lose it.
[02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:04.345]  Because cash is your only anonymous payment method.
[02:45:04.505 --> 02:45:06.626]  And not only anonymous, because a lot of people say, well, I don't care.
[02:45:06.646 --> 02:45:07.326]  People know what I buy.
[02:45:07.346 --> 02:45:11.227]  It doesn't matter, because your credit card number can be turned off.
[02:45:11.467 --> 02:45:12.088]  Your $50 bill cannot.
[02:45:13.573 --> 02:45:17.075]  You know, without a whole lot of whole other kind of thing going on that everybody's going to notice.
[02:45:17.515 --> 02:45:21.438]  But don't rely so much on these electronic things.
[02:45:21.498 --> 02:45:24.139]  And notice they're already trying to demonize cash.
[02:45:24.159 --> 02:45:26.020]  They're already trying to get rid of it.
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:30.163]  Because once they've got you cashless, there's no escaping all the fines and fees.
[02:45:30.603 --> 02:45:30.963]  That's right.
[02:45:31.083 --> 02:45:40.591]  And not only the fines, fees, and taxes, and them getting their cut of every single thing you do, but also the traceability, the trackability, and more importantly, their ability to say no.
[02:45:41.192 --> 02:45:47.317]  So, you know, you look at some of these insurance companies, and they've actually had conversations about using your frequent shopper card.
[02:45:47.357 --> 02:45:48.578]  That's how I got started in all this.
[02:45:48.738 --> 02:45:51.981]  Using the card that you're showing at Safeway or Kroger or wherever you're shopping,
[02:45:52.441 --> 02:45:59.266]  And using it to say, you are overweight, or you have high blood pressure, and so you cannot buy these particular items.
[02:45:59.366 --> 02:46:08.773]  And when you scan your card, rather than making it discounts, it's going to be the mandatory scan of your ID card, and we're going to make you put back all the things on your shopping cart.
[02:46:08.833 --> 02:46:11.655]  They're already doing stuff like that.
[02:46:11.695 --> 02:46:16.458]  I saw a case a few years ago where the guy admitted he drank a six-pack of beer every night to his doctor.
[02:46:17.299 --> 02:46:22.367]  And so, it was a bizarre story how they then gave him a DWI even though he wasn't driving.
[02:46:22.707 --> 02:46:27.334]  I mean, they're now arresting five-year-olds that run on the playground, Associated Press, Catherine.
[02:46:27.734 --> 02:46:29.696]  Yeah, it's where we're going.
[02:46:29.756 --> 02:46:35.541]  So if people don't want to live in that kind of world, and I think most of us don't, then you've got to say, how am I contributing to it?
[02:46:36.021 --> 02:46:54.938]  And if every other word out of your mouth is Google this or Google that, if you're whipping out your Visa credit card to pay for everything you do, if you're doing all of your purchasing online instead of actually going to real stores, brick and mortar, and supporting local businesses, if you're going to Walmart every time you need to fill your shopping cart, then you are basically contributing to the problem because
[02:46:55.818 --> 02:47:12.054]  Doing the status quo, taking those default settings is adding to the problem and we've got to be in mass and I know enough people listen to your program that even if just we did this we'd have a massive impact because you know I drive up and down the freeways by the way in New Hampshire and I see Infowars bumper stickers on the back of random cars.
[02:47:12.294 --> 02:47:13.856]  I mean you are everywhere Alex.
[02:47:14.376 --> 02:47:19.041]  So if the listeners to this radio program would get a clue and say alright here are some things I'm going to do.
[02:47:19.061 --> 02:47:19.942]  I'm going to start paying cash.
[02:47:20.542 --> 02:47:24.965]  I'm going to start patronizing locally owned stores, even if I have to pay more.
[02:47:25.005 --> 02:47:27.026]  You know, everybody always says, oh, but everything's so cheap at Walmart.
[02:47:27.327 --> 02:47:28.547]  I say, how cheap is your freedom?
[02:47:28.628 --> 02:47:30.008]  How much are you willing to sell that for?
[02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:33.791]  Because I would rather go to a local store, and I do this consciously.
[02:47:34.238 --> 02:47:46.026]  And spend an extra 50 cents on a $2 item, consciously aware, with total awareness that I'm spending more, and I view that 50 cents as me putting money to fund the things I believe in.
[02:47:46.106 --> 02:47:51.809]  And by the way, there's so much stuff out there, a lot of times you can buy stuff at a swap meet or a garage sale.
[02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:57.393]  That's why the headline Fox News last year, $15 million fine for garage sale.
[02:47:59.435 --> 02:48:03.319]  Forbes asked the question, why is there a war against lemonade stands?
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:07.724]  Why is there a war against Amish or folks selling pecans on the side of the highway?
[02:48:08.064 --> 02:48:11.308]  Because the system, this is a corporate takeover.
[02:48:12.069 --> 02:48:13.611]  And they want you under their control.
[02:48:14.131 --> 02:48:18.976]  Is those little sales, they may seem little to us, but they're a massive part of the economy.
[02:48:19.196 --> 02:48:20.758]  And those guys want everything.
[02:48:20.778 --> 02:48:21.839]  You know, it's the greed factor.
[02:48:21.879 --> 02:48:22.500]  I want everything.
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:25.883]  You know, Google wants all the searches and all the phone calls and all of the everythings.
[02:48:26.384 --> 02:48:29.747]  And you know, and by the way, I shouldn't single out Google because that's kind of not fair.
[02:48:29.767 --> 02:48:30.528]  It's also Yahoo.
[02:48:31.008 --> 02:48:35.509]  It is hot mail, it is... But Microsoft, and we're almost out of time, we're almost out of time.
[02:48:35.889 --> 02:48:38.230]  Speaking of that, because I want to come back and take a few calls for you, Catherine.
[02:48:39.010 --> 02:48:39.750]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[02:48:40.050 --> 02:48:49.653]  Forced to stand for 24 hours, suicide necks, toxin exposure and explosions inside the Chinese factories making iPads for Apple.
[02:48:50.093 --> 02:48:54.654]  I mean, that just shows how sickening Apple is, now they pose as trendy liberals.
[02:48:55.464 --> 02:48:57.487]  Now, speaking of that, here's Bill Gates.
[02:48:58.027 --> 02:49:01.492]  And if you go read the ABC News blog, the whole thing is sponsored.
[02:49:01.893 --> 02:49:05.257]  And they've got a link there that it's paid for by Bill Gates.
[02:49:05.357 --> 02:49:10.844]  And in the articles, I'll tell you how much he loves you when he's on record being a eugenicist that says, literally, kill granny.
[02:49:11.425 --> 02:49:12.166]  People don't believe that.
[02:49:12.206 --> 02:49:15.150]  Just type in Bill Gates calls for death panels.
[02:49:15.690 --> 02:49:16.351]  Now look at this.
[02:49:16.832 --> 02:49:21.097]  He is now bought into Monsanto big time.
[02:49:21.718 --> 02:49:22.219]  But look at this.
[02:49:22.399 --> 02:49:23.180]  London Guardian.
[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:27.565]  Food crisis compromises fight against world hunger warns UN report.
[02:49:28.413 --> 02:49:30.614]  And it goes in, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:49:30.914 --> 02:49:42.019]  They're literally financing the entire news and what's said, and it's all about how much he wants people to get food, but then in his real writings and statements, he's actually trying to cut the people off.
[02:49:42.039 --> 02:49:51.384]  I mean, here's this eugenicist whose dad ran Planned Parenthood, financing propaganda that's the opposite of what he really does, Catherine.
[02:49:53.871 --> 02:49:54.872]  The whole food thing, huh?
[02:49:55.172 --> 02:49:56.232]  You know, it does come down.
[02:49:56.252 --> 02:50:01.135]  I mean, we can talk information control all we want, but in the final analysis it comes down to food.
[02:50:01.315 --> 02:50:01.815]  I mean, it does.
[02:50:01.875 --> 02:50:03.456]  It comes down to food, water, and air.
[02:50:03.576 --> 02:50:07.818]  You know, you cut that off and you will have a population very quickly doing whatever you want.
[02:50:08.378 --> 02:50:12.300]  So, when Bill Gates starts talking about controlling food, I start getting super nervous.
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:15.021]  And when he talks about genetically modifying mosquitoes,
[02:50:15.881 --> 02:50:23.227]  Like, that's the last thing I need is Microsoft, you know, who can barely run an operating system, releasing a bunch of genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment.
[02:50:23.267 --> 02:50:23.768]  No thank you.
[02:50:23.868 --> 02:50:24.989]  You know why they can barely run it?
[02:50:25.029 --> 02:50:26.790]  It's got so many back doors built into it.
[02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:27.290]  Spying.
[02:50:28.011 --> 02:50:32.635]  We all think, as you point out, we're using Google, we're using Microsoft to... No, no, no.
[02:50:32.895 --> 02:50:33.876]  That's only part of it.
[02:50:34.636 --> 02:50:35.757]  It's got the back door.
[02:50:35.817 --> 02:50:37.979]  The whole thing is designed to see what you're doing.
[02:50:38.479 --> 02:50:38.919]  That's right.
[02:50:38.999 --> 02:50:42.581]  So, yeah, and by the way, speaking of Microsoft, Linux is your other opt-out.
[02:50:42.821 --> 02:50:45.723]  Check off the checkbox and get out of the default setting.
[02:50:46.023 --> 02:50:49.805]  Just like Start Pages for Google, that's what Linux is for Microsoft.
[02:50:51.066 --> 02:50:52.427]  Yeah, stop using Google.
[02:50:52.467 --> 02:50:54.208]  We've got to move forward with a boycott.
[02:50:54.568 --> 02:50:55.649]  And I know they own YouTube.
[02:50:55.689 --> 02:51:00.171]  I'll continue to operate there, attacking and exposing their globalist takeover program.
[02:51:00.632 --> 02:51:01.712]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:51:02.152 --> 02:51:03.333]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:03.573 --> 02:51:06.515]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team.
[02:51:06.815 --> 02:51:14.017]  I want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:14.237 --> 02:51:18.358]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:51:18.698 --> 02:51:21.139]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:21.439 --> 02:51:32.202]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:32.702 --> 02:51:35.983]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:36.203 --> 02:51:41.865]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:42.345 --> 02:51:51.829]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:52.229 --> 02:51:53.389]  The war is here.
[02:51:53.729 --> 02:51:55.150]  It's an info war.
[02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:57.551]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:06.972]  If you're taking one, two, five or more nutritional supplements, please stop.

[02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:05.401]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:05.721 --> 02:53:06.442]  That bears repeating.
[02:53:06.762 --> 02:53:10.283]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:10.643 --> 02:53:14.885]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[02:54:06.218 --> 02:54:07.959]  Okay, it's our last segment with Catherine.
[02:54:07.979 --> 02:54:12.441]  I'll do a little five-minute extra to make sure I get to most of these calls that I've been holding.
[02:54:12.981 --> 02:54:14.602]  But look at this New York Times article.
[02:54:14.982 --> 02:54:16.542]  The struggle for daily bread.
[02:54:16.562 --> 02:54:17.943]  The U.S.
[02:54:17.963 --> 02:54:22.365]  government pays farmers to produce less than half the food they could.
[02:54:23.848 --> 02:54:25.069]  It's the same in other countries.
[02:54:25.649 --> 02:54:36.338]  GMO is all about controlling the food supply and turning it into a genetic bioweapon, basically, that doesn't produce more seeds that you've got to continue to purchase from the globalist.
[02:54:37.138 --> 02:54:44.344]  It's the computer makers going in and basically genetically manipulating things and turning it into their own products so they can create monopolies.
[02:54:45.575 --> 02:54:47.815]  Here's the New York Times' struggle for daily bread.
[02:54:48.216 --> 02:54:53.217]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, now the world's principal private funder of agricultural research.
[02:54:53.997 --> 02:55:00.498]  This is a guy that, you know, wants to release mosquitoes that carry vaccines to force us to take the shots.
[02:55:01.278 --> 02:55:02.739]  He's into weather weapon funding.
[02:55:02.759 --> 02:55:03.899]  He's the number one funder of that.
[02:55:03.939 --> 02:55:05.259]  I mean, he's super creepy.
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:08.360]  And you look at all these other characters that are involved.
[02:55:10.049 --> 02:55:14.782]  They always propagandize about how much they want us to, you know, have all this freedom and how much they love us.
[02:55:15.383 --> 02:55:17.228]  But meanwhile, it's the opposite, Catherine.
[02:55:20.703 --> 02:55:21.364]  And it has that.
[02:55:21.824 --> 02:55:22.845]  Has finally figured it out.
[02:55:22.925 --> 02:55:26.088]  And again, you know, our parents didn't know that, and our grandparents didn't know it.
[02:55:26.148 --> 02:55:29.992]  They saw Walter Cronkite on the evening news, and it was gospel.
[02:55:30.512 --> 02:55:31.673]  So, that's my point.
[02:55:31.813 --> 02:55:42.803]  And what has changed that, and what has created this window for us to know this, to actually be able to hear what you're saying and understand it, believe it, and understand that it's true, and that that is the way the world works, this is like, this is like unprecedented.
[02:55:43.044 --> 02:55:45.446]  People have always believed the propaganda, except for a tiny
[02:55:45.606 --> 02:55:46.286]  We're good to go.
[02:56:04.706 --> 02:56:05.687]  They miscalculated.
[02:56:05.727 --> 02:56:10.110]  They always knew there'd be people resisting them, but they thought they'd just call us conspiracy theorists.
[02:56:10.210 --> 02:56:16.574]  Now, many of us have audiences bigger than their organs, and it's freaking them out, and they miscalculated.
[02:56:16.614 --> 02:56:18.375]  They miscalculated, folks.
[02:56:18.655 --> 02:56:19.515]  We're in the fight.
[02:56:19.916 --> 02:56:21.737]  Doesn't mean we're winning, but we're in the fight.
[02:56:21.997 --> 02:56:23.058]  We better fight harder.
[02:56:23.338 --> 02:56:29.121]  Get the word out about InfoWars.com, about alternative media, about StartPage.com, about it all.
[02:56:29.562 --> 02:56:31.042]  Get the word out today.
[02:56:31.323 --> 02:56:32.884]  Julio in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[02:56:32.904 --> 02:56:33.204]  Welcome.
[02:56:35.189 --> 02:56:35.569]  Uh, yes.
[02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:36.310]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:36.690 --> 02:56:37.871]  Uh, I got a suggestion.
[02:56:37.891 --> 02:56:37.931]  U.S.
[02:56:38.732 --> 02:56:41.074]  state-run media or U.S.
[02:56:41.174 --> 02:56:51.462]  corporate media, um, seeing how they're all run by corporations, multinational corporations, all admitting that they support SOPA, so it seems perfect.
[02:56:51.822 --> 02:56:55.425]  Just like in China and in North Korea, they're state-run television.
[02:56:55.445 --> 02:56:59.088]  No, they're the monopoly state-run media.
[02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:03.431]  I mean, it turns out most of the media, so-called mainstream media, got bank or bailout money, Catherine.
[02:57:03.451 --> 02:57:03.792]  Remember that?
[02:57:04.352 --> 02:57:05.253]  Oh yeah, they did.
[02:57:05.634 --> 02:57:07.636]  And it doesn't take much.
[02:57:07.656 --> 02:57:12.842]  I mean, you take a look at, like, who's at the Bilderberg conferences, as you report on so efficiently.
[02:57:13.342 --> 02:57:14.524]  And, you know, it's all the media.
[02:57:14.684 --> 02:57:16.746]  It's the mainstream media who's at those events.
[02:57:17.027 --> 02:57:18.188]  You know, Google's there.
[02:57:18.268 --> 02:57:18.769]  They're all there.
[02:57:19.619 --> 02:57:32.868]  Well, you know, Schmidt was there, and right after that happened, we got stuff filed on us, websites on YouTube taken down, and got not just delisted from Google News, but they lowered our search rankings a week after that.
[02:57:33.588 --> 02:57:34.048]  Ouch.
[02:57:34.549 --> 02:57:35.930]  Yeah, okay, well you got slapped.
[02:57:36.977 --> 02:57:38.938]  Well, he had reporters there in his face, yeah.
[02:57:39.339 --> 02:57:42.761]  I think they'd like the ability to do that to everybody.
[02:57:42.921 --> 02:57:49.946]  And see, that's the thing, even, you know, Google started off saying don't be evil, and Google offers some fantastic products, no question about it.
[02:57:50.647 --> 02:57:59.894]  And even if Google, if you trusted them as much as you trust your best friend, the reality is once everything gets consolidated into a single location... It can always be taken over and it has been.
[02:57:59.914 --> 02:58:00.194]  That's right.
[02:58:00.214 --> 02:58:01.475]  We're almost out of time, Catherine.
[02:58:01.495 --> 02:58:02.836]  Real quick, Julio, any other points?
[02:58:04.555 --> 02:58:08.059]  Um, well, yeah, just that, uh, Catherine, a question for you.
[02:58:08.079 --> 02:58:10.542]  Uh, you know how GoDaddy's supporting SOPA.
[02:58:10.582 --> 02:58:14.926]  What's a good, you know, alternative, uh, server?
[02:58:15.367 --> 02:58:16.308]  You can look into that.
[02:58:16.348 --> 02:58:20.332]  You can look into, uh, domain registrars that are anti-SOPA, can't you, Catherine?
[02:58:20.751 --> 02:58:21.351]  Yeah, you can.
[02:58:21.592 --> 02:58:23.533]  And, you know, go to StartPage.com to do it.
[02:58:24.494 --> 02:58:25.094]  Not Google.
[02:58:25.414 --> 02:58:27.536]  But, yeah, and, you know, we're working on an email.
[02:58:27.716 --> 02:58:34.260]  And, by the way, if people want to be beta testers, they can email me, just KMA at StartPage.com, and I'll see if I can get them on the beta test.
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:35.101]  Very exciting.
[02:58:35.121 --> 02:58:37.122]  We're going to have to get you back on more about this.
[02:58:37.162 --> 02:58:38.763]  Thank you so much, Kathryn Olbeck.
[02:58:38.803 --> 02:58:40.745]  We're on tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:42.606 --> 02:58:43.627]  In Fall Wars Nightly News.
[02:58:43.647 --> 02:58:45.308]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.072 --> 02:58:50.473]  Oh, by the way, tomorrow's the last day we're 44% off on a yearly membership.
[02:58:50.773 --> 02:58:51.233]  President Blanin.
[02:58:53.354 --> 02:58:56.995]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:57.375 --> 02:59:00.375]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:59:00.615 --> 02:59:05.417]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:05.757 --> 02:59:11.598]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.798 --> 02:59:16.765]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:27.099 --> 02:59:29.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:30.760]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:33.301]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:33.481 --> 02:59:35.322]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:35.602 --> 02:59:40.423]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:40.764 --> 02:59:45.545]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:00:21.338 --> 03:00:24.681]  Alright, going into some overdrive here to jam in at least three more phone calls.
[03:00:24.741 --> 03:00:26.423]  John Jay and Mouse Link.
[03:00:28.244 --> 03:00:29.365]  John and then Mouse Link.
[03:00:29.586 --> 03:00:30.706]  You're on the air from Florida.
[03:00:30.747 --> 03:00:31.607]  John, thanks for holding.
[03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:34.170]  No problem, Alex.
[03:00:34.210 --> 03:00:35.130]  Great to be on your show.
[03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:35.811]  Love what you do.
[03:00:36.492 --> 03:00:37.512]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[03:00:38.593 --> 03:00:39.875]  I wanted to... Can you hear me, Alex?
[03:00:40.035 --> 03:00:40.335]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:41.828 --> 03:00:55.755]  I wanted to mention, I was watching Fox News the other night, Sarah Palin was being interviewed, and the interviewer was talking about Mitt Romney, how he was the best candidate to go up against Obama, and Palin was making a case for Newt Gingrich.
[03:00:55.795 --> 03:01:01.117]  Well, we all know Newt Gingrich is as corrupt as he comes, but she was making a case for him.
[03:01:01.157 --> 03:01:05.179]  But, as she was talking, she said something very interesting towards the end of the interview.
[03:01:05.219 --> 03:01:09.381]  She said, those pundits who are telling them what to do,
[03:01:11.025 --> 03:01:18.468]  And those elites who want them to obey and listen to them and want them to shut the race down.
[03:01:18.568 --> 03:01:22.449]  And just as she said that, the interviewer completely cut her off.
[03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:29.972]  So it is just real interesting when you hear something like that on the mainstream media after you get a kick out of that one.
[03:01:30.412 --> 03:01:32.253]  Well, there are different camps.
[03:01:33.493 --> 03:01:37.296]  And Genrich has always been a Democratic operative.
[03:01:37.937 --> 03:01:41.980]  And so the reason Republicans are attacking him isn't because he's such a globalist.
[03:01:42.741 --> 03:01:43.541]  So is Romney.
[03:01:43.621 --> 03:01:49.506]  It's that he's pretty much always been known, this is now coming out, as a Democratic Party operative.
[03:01:51.147 --> 03:01:53.509]  And as a globalist, you know, a deep cover operative.
[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:56.852]  And so it's, you know, the fact is Republicans don't like him.
[03:01:57.352 --> 03:01:58.593]  He's not even a rhino.
[03:01:59.682 --> 03:02:02.243]  And so that's why they can't stand him.
[03:02:02.823 --> 03:02:08.046]  Because he did sabotage a lot of stuff that they wanted back in the 80s and 90s while posing as a conservative.
[03:02:08.406 --> 03:02:10.827]  He's extremely out of control.
[03:02:10.947 --> 03:02:14.929]  I think the elite are scared of him because he is such an egomaniac.
[03:02:15.029 --> 03:02:18.650]  They don't want somebody who might actually try to be president, even though he'd be evil.
[03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:21.251]  They want somebody who's more of a puppet like Mitt Romney.
[03:02:21.952 --> 03:02:23.692]  And that's my analysis of the situation.
[03:02:25.473 --> 03:02:26.994]  And in a way, that's kind of true.
[03:02:27.014 --> 03:02:28.555]  I mean, I'm not saying I like Mitt Romney.
[03:02:28.795 --> 03:02:30.096]  It's just, Gingrich is dangerous.
[03:02:30.616 --> 03:02:31.736]  As I've been saying for years.
[03:02:32.297 --> 03:02:34.618]  I mean, the elite are even scared of him.
[03:02:34.658 --> 03:02:36.039]  I mean, he's a psychopath.
[03:02:36.079 --> 03:02:36.659]  He's dangerous.
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:42.882]  And so, that's why they want a rubber stamp puppet, empty suit like Obama or Romney.
[03:02:43.102 --> 03:02:44.303]  Appreciate the call, great points.
[03:02:44.643 --> 03:02:46.444]  Mouth Link in New York, you're on the air.
[03:02:46.464 --> 03:02:49.186]  Alex, so good to speak to you.
[03:02:49.526 --> 03:02:50.667]  Is Catherine still on the line?
[03:02:50.747 --> 03:02:51.227]  She's gone.
[03:02:52.037 --> 03:03:01.903]  Okay, I had a couple of questions for her about the announcement that Twitter made this week about being able to selectively remove tweets based on the country of origin.
[03:03:01.923 --> 03:03:03.224]  Did you see that at all?
[03:03:03.404 --> 03:03:04.005]  Yes, I covered it.
[03:03:04.025 --> 03:03:07.127]  It's in the Daily Mail and Associated Press and London Guardian.
[03:03:07.387 --> 03:03:11.249]  They're just announcing they're going to censor any time they want any government request.
[03:03:11.530 --> 03:03:16.133]  If you're in Thailand and say, I don't like the taxes are too high, boom, your account's gone.
[03:03:16.473 --> 03:03:17.233]  Not just your tweet.
[03:03:17.273 --> 03:03:19.094]  They're admitting that they're going to censor.
[03:03:19.375 --> 03:03:21.176]  Twitter is hooked up with the State Department.
[03:03:21.636 --> 03:03:24.320]  On record, Twitter is a globalist operation.
[03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:26.904]  We use it, but it doesn't mean it'll be there forever.
[03:03:26.964 --> 03:03:31.149]  We use their big platforms to reach people, but we know it's all part of the internet takeover.
[03:03:32.270 --> 03:03:33.011]  I agree with you.
[03:03:33.031 --> 03:03:34.251]  I like Twitter a lot.
[03:03:34.732 --> 03:03:43.297]  You know, what I think is that we need to sidestep the official systems of communication and create alternative technology.
[03:03:43.397 --> 03:03:52.223]  And what I wish that somebody was talking about, because I don't hear anybody mentioning this idea, is that we could create a peer-to-peer internet based on existing technologies
[03:03:52.763 --> 03:03:57.468]  Well, stuff like that's gonna happen, but the biggest thing is just going to other sites that aren't part of the globalist insider ring.
[03:04:12.643 --> 03:04:20.809]  And fighting for the freedom of the web, pointing out that it's nothing but a monopolistic takeover taking place, and using the web while we've still got it.
[03:04:21.089 --> 03:04:27.814]  I mean, folks, please, on your Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, plug InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:28.074 --> 03:04:31.136]  There's a reason they're starting more and more to censor us.
[03:04:31.917 --> 03:04:39.462]  By the way, I keep forgetting, and I don't know if the link's up yet, but we're going to have InfoWars.com forward slash on the road.
[03:04:40.923 --> 03:04:47.468]  Uh, but I'm going to be speaking in Dallas and Orlando, Florida, coming up in only, like, 19, what, 20 days from now.
[03:04:47.808 --> 03:04:48.889]  And I haven't even really plugged this.
[03:04:48.929 --> 03:04:49.770]  Tickets are on sale.
[03:04:49.790 --> 03:04:50.390]  They'll go quick.
[03:04:50.931 --> 03:04:53.252]  Once folks find out about it, you can find the article about it.
[03:04:53.573 --> 03:04:57.095]  It's titled, Alex Jones, Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[03:04:57.135 --> 03:04:59.277]  See you back tonight, 7 o'clock.
