[00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:14.352]  We're good to go.
[00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:30.009]  What's your take on the growing surveillance?
[00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.036]  I think it's gonna easily get out of control if we don't get a handle on it quick, quickly.
[00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:43.903]  I just personally feel like our privacy is being really invaded, especially the Google Maps when they come around to your house and they're taking pictures.
[00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.425]  I mean, I don't like that people have an aerial view of my home.
[00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:47.446]  I think it's horrible.
[00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:49.148]  I think we have to do everything we can to stop it.
[00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:50.989]  I think we've got to fight it at every turn.
[00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:52.111]  I think we've got to sue them.
[00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:53.952]  We've got to file lawsuits against these people.
[00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:55.714]  We've got to file criminal charges against them.
[00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.155]  We've got to bring them in front of grand juries.
[00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.919]  We've got to do everything we can to stop it, or it's just going to keep getting worse and worse.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.603]  I just don't like it, and it's more and more signs of tyranny.
[00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:07.575]  What are your thoughts on Alex's show?
[00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:08.736]  Alex Jones and Infowars.
[00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:09.437]  What are your thoughts?
[00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:12.839]  I listen to Alex Jones Monday through Friday every day.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:26.268]  And he exposed me to a lot of ideas that I would have thought were irrational five years ago, but I watched the Bush elections and the Dimple Chads 2000-2004.
[00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:29.791]  I was horrified by what I saw and it was amazing when I watched 9-11.
[00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.371]  I didn't believe 9-11.
[00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.834]  And Alex Jones was the only person out on the media who was pointing out the truth.
[00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:41.376]  And because of him, I've been reading a lot of books by a lot of authors and I've been exposed to a lot of ideas.
[00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:44.978]  And it feels good to be awake.
[00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:46.219]  It feels good.
[00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.240]  Speaking of being awake, do you think the public's asleep to this?
[00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:51.498]  Pretty much.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.824]  Alex and his show Infowars just woke me up six years ago.
[00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:02.569]  I came from another country and I lived through this illusion.
[00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:11.819]  America the freedom and greatest country and I started realizing this is not much that freedom because if we are afraid of police
[00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.440]  If the truth hurts, let it hurt.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.321]  You know, it's just like a good
[00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:45.964]  Reiki session or massage session, you know, with the rolfing, like some rolfing session.
[00:02:45.984 --> 00:02:52.065]  You know, sometimes the truth hurts and it's going to put you back in alignment and your energy is going to start flowing and you're going to start feeling better.
[00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.066]  You know, who likes to drink wheatgrass?
[00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:58.727]  Well, drink wheatgrass and, you know, your cancer might go away.
[00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:03.388]  You know, look at some of these institutes like Ohio Health Institute.
[00:03:03.648 --> 00:03:05.389]  You know, people that are putting information out,
[00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:07.266]  They're heroes.
[00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:12.069]  Alex, I call him the cowboy that hung out with the Indians a little too much.
[00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:22.797]  You know, Alex can make these subjects palatable to the society, the empire, that is mostly masculine-based and hooked on violence and guns.
[00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:25.960]  He can talk to the football crowd and the cops and get along with them.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.303]  You know, none of the peace activists were able to make peace with cops or veterans.
