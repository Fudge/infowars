[00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:23.684]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:25.044]  It's Monday, January 9, 2012.
[00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:32.468]  Now, coming up in the broadcast, we have Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com on a host of issues.
[00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:35.349]  But, of course, we have plenty of news before that.
[00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.550]  Now, we know this is a kept nation.
[00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.291]  We know all the rules are broken.
[00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:40.872]  We know wars are planned.
[00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:41.733]  I think so.
[00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.372]  Here in this busy graphic you can see some of the indicators.
[00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:14.839]  War in the Middle East now appears imminent as the U.S., Britain, the European Union, and Israel put the finishing touches on an embargo against Iran, a de facto declaration of war with warships steaming toward the Persian Gulf.
[00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.160]  But that's not all.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.663]  Of course we have the recent U.S.-Israeli war games in the Persian Gulf.
[00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:28.128]  We have Iran with its war games, an announcement of more war games, including to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.570]  We have Britain sending in warships.
[00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.271]  We already have Russian warships in the area.
[00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:38.195]  French and Russian warships off the coast of Syria, according to Depkafile.
[00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.633]  And we have the statements from Ron Paul that sanctions are the first step towards war.
[00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:45.733]  Now is he right?
[00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:46.834]  Let's listen to the quote.
[00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:59.223]  Sanctions were the first step in our wars against Iraq and Libya and now more sanctions planned against Syria and Iran are leading down the same destructive path Ron Paul warned.
[00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:03.386]  But of course no one wants to listen to Ron Paul when there's a war they could have.
[00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:06.568]  So they'll probably be leaning towards a kept political
[00:02:08.257 --> 00:02:28.792]  Puppet oil prices are also rising along with tensions now headed towards 113 a barrel and many experts predict the prices could be well over 200 250 300 even 500 if the Strait of Hormuz was blocked or if a war went hot of course there's a whole covert war against Iran going on in the background
[00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:29.592]  Why?
[00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:31.613]  Because there's a hit list against Iran.
[00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:33.334]  It's on the globalist hit list.
[00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:39.096]  The question was how and when, not why or if there would be a war with Iran.
[00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.177]  So that's why I stress, is this the time?
[00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:46.019]  Now, you also have the Iranian missile base propaganda.
[00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.460]  You see that today in the Associated Press.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.141]  Iran nuke work at bunker is, quote, confirmed.
[00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:58.344]  Diplomats on Monday confirmed a report that Iran has begun uranium enrichment
[00:02:58.684 --> 00:03:10.454]  At an underground bunker, and the news is particularly worrying because the site is being used to make material that could be upgraded more quickly for use in nuclear weapon than the nation's main enriched stockpile.
[00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:11.535]  Is this true?
[00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:20.263]  I don't know, but you certainly have to question the timing, along with other reports that Aminah Jod's visit to South America could be tied to long range missiles.
[00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:24.484]  And more, you can smell it in the air, war is brewing somewhere.
[00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:26.245]  Will they actually kick it off?
[00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:31.746]  You saw a lot of propaganda several years ago in 06 for the Iranian war.
[00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:36.048]  It didn't happen then because so many people were warning against it happening.
[00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:40.769]  So I hope our warning here again can make them back off another time because
[00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.850]  Again, we know they're in the crosshairs.
[00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.292]  Nobody wants a World War III that won't be good for anyone except the bankers.
[00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:56.497]  Of course, you also have the Russian naval flotilla docked in Syria with an undermining effort, of course, going on in Syria as well.
[00:03:56.658 --> 00:04:02.321]  Al-Qaeda operatives and others staging the coup in that country on top of everything else.
[00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:08.324]  The port call is aimed at bringing the two countries closer together and strengthening ties of friendship.
[00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:15.650]  The official SANA news agency quoted a Russian naval officer concerning their ships outside of Syria.
[00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:21.415]  Meanwhile, you have the rigged political game as the Republican primaries are underway.
[00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:39.636]  The first official primary vote tomorrow in New Hampshire on the heels of the Iowa caucus, where Ron Paul finished third but had an essentially statistical tie for first in terms of the delegates that were won at that event.
[00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:56.457]  Now the whole deal leading into New Hampshire is we see a brand new wave of prostitute interruptions and circus and media claims of putting Ron Paul in a bad light just the day before the vote with him in second place.
[00:04:57.017 --> 00:05:04.705]  First of all, you have this incident earlier that you're seeing video of where the camera surrounded Ron Paul when he was at a meet and greet.
[00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:06.987]  He was supposed to meet New Hampshire primary voters.
[00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:13.974]  Instead, they packed the house with a bunch of high school students from Massachusetts and the press gang wouldn't allow him to reach the voters.
[00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:20.220]  Then when he left, the media spun it and tried to act as if it was Ron Paul refusing to reach out to voters.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.065]  One woman in particular became irate, started screaming at Ron Paul and claiming he had promised to meet with their mother.
[00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:33.490]  Apparently, some reports indicate a staffer or something had given the woman reassurances.
[00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.353]  Ron Paul himself wasn't in position to talk to these people and pretty much had to leave the event.
[00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:44.958]  But that didn't stop The Hill from saying media mob chases Ron Paul from campaign stop in New Hampshire.
[00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.319]  I think?
[00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.239]  I think so.
[00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:54.323]  Then, you have CBS today, another of the branch of prostitutes, who blatantly excluded Ron Paul from their coverage, showing a new poll from Sulfic University, where they accidentally, for the 50th time, omitted Ron Paul from poll results in these prostitute media channels, the so-called mainstream media.
[00:06:54.383 --> 00:07:01.425]  They show Ron Paul with a hefty 43% lead, and then Gingrich, Hutzman, and Santorum all in single digits.
[00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:14.930]  Now, they are trying to annoy Mitt Romney, as many have pointed out, but they also presumably want to keep Ron Paul's name out of the headlines so he's not able to gain momentum because he's the only anti-war candidate.
[00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:25.454]  As we've just shown you, they're gearing up for a war big time and you know Obama, Romney, or any other creature is only going to back up that war, whatever they may say publicly.
[00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:29.336]  Now we have a clip from CBS regarding how he was left out of the poll.
[00:07:30.225 --> 00:07:40.151]  I'm really here for one reason and one reason only, and that is to make sure that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States of America.
[00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:44.893]  Expectations are high in what has become Romney's adopted home state.
[00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:51.697]  A New Suffolk University poll shows him with a commanding lead in New Hampshire, at almost 30 points above his rivals.
[00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:55.660]  At the same time, Newt Gingrich and John Huntsman have faltered.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:04.947]  Rick Santorum, who polls in single digits here, is looking to give Romney a run in the Granite State after his near victory in Iowa.
[00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:15.817]  And of course it's no surprise not only to see them leaving Ron Paul out of it, but to seeing aging flip-floppers who support war, like John McCain supporting people like Romney.
[00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:22.763]  Now, we're all going to be watching on this Diebold thing, because in 2008 there were a lot of really unaccounted for swings.
[00:08:23.423 --> 00:08:31.192]  Uh, for instance, Hillary Clinton ended up winning in 2008 by 3%, even though she was down 13% in the polls.
[00:08:31.272 --> 00:08:33.495]  An unexplained 16 point swing.
[00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:37.800]  Uh, you know, Rudy Giuliani got more votes than he probably should have.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.442]  And Romney really got a boost in 2008 in New Hampshire from the diabolical voting machines.
[00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:52.906]  Of course, Ron Paul himself got zero votes in Sutton County, which they recorded until people came forward and said they voted for him.
[00:08:53.427 --> 00:09:01.050]  They later had to admit that they omitted 31 votes from that little area and said, oh, it was human error, one of those
[00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.211]  Things that just happened.
[00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:05.994]  So we're all going to keep an eye on it tomorrow and see what happens.
[00:09:06.454 --> 00:09:10.217]  Because I don't think they want the snowball effect for the Ron Paul campaign.
[00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:13.300]  For some reason he's just not allowed to win in 2012.
[00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:20.626]  Meanwhile, in true occultic fashion, there was a secret White House party in 2009.
[00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:24.970]  A secret Alice in Wonderland bash for Halloween during the recession.
[00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.274]  Now they had a much more humble Halloween festivity that was covered by the media.
[00:09:29.914 --> 00:09:30.334]  I think so.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:45.960]  I think so.
[00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:18.094]  Well, you know, while the whole recession was going on and the economy was tanking and people were worried just about making ends meet, all while people were having fun in the White House.
[00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:20.055]  But I'm sure that's the least of it.
[00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:24.317]  But nonetheless, an interesting story there with the Mad Hatter and all.
[00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.180]  Scientists create silkworm spider hybrid that spins super strong silk.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.281]  Of course, we've already reported on
[00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.645]  Spider goats, genetically modified goats with spider silk put in them.
[00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:43.129]  Now they have genetically modified silk worms spliced in with the stronger spider silk.
[00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.773]  Scientists have used genes from spiders to create a new type of silk worm that could spin extra tough silk.
[00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:55.537]  Spider genes were injected into silk worms making them spin silk stronger than still.
[00:10:55.597 --> 00:11:02.442]  A group of biologists have created a new type of genetically modified silk worm capable of spinning extra strong silk.
[00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:18.989]  Spider-Man style now the problem here is things are gonna get carried away really quickly We also had this report this week of the monkeys created from six different parents spliced together chimeras You also had the army ants where they?
[00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:24.632]  Re-engineered the already existing DNA to create new super ants with giant heads.
[00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:33.717]  And that's just the stuff they talk about publicly as they talk about creating human-animal hybrids to harvest clones from and a whole lot more.
[00:11:34.098 --> 00:11:35.018]  Who's watching this?
[00:11:35.098 --> 00:11:37.660]  Is anyone regulating this for potential dangers?
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:48.146]  Or is it just all to make body armor silk for the military-industrial complex because spiders can't be handily bred because they are too aggressive to each other in captivity?
[00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:52.619]  Well, it's something to think about and we'll continue to watch that in the future.
[00:11:53.119 --> 00:12:02.046]  Meanwhile, a story on the New Jersey mayor who wants to pay you $1,000 to report illegal guns and destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:08.470]  Brandon Smith of AltMarket reports, there's nothing more disgusting or detestable than a citizen informant.
[00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:12.613]  Without citizen informants, tyrants could never retain the kind of power they wield.
[00:12:12.994 --> 00:12:17.317]  In fact, without citizen informants, totalitarian movements would never gain traction.
[00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:30.057]  But of course, this is why every functional oligarchy throughout history has implemented programs designed to encourage the development of common spies using the promise of monetary reward or collective recognition.
[00:12:31.038 --> 00:12:37.263]  An innocent man who is disarmed by law will always be victimized by an outlaw who is armed through criminality.
[00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:44.087]  Now, the concept of reduced crime through gun confiscation is so naive it warrants considerable analysis.
[00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:48.631]  Through such efforts, good men are left defenseless while evil men are free to wreak havoc.
[00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:51.012]  Those are the words of Brandon Smith at Alt-Market.
[00:12:51.112 --> 00:12:51.632]  Good writer.
[00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:56.634]  He also adds, the Second Amendment is not a negotiable or debatable pillar of the Constitution.
[00:12:57.094 --> 00:13:12.259]  It is absolute in its protection, and yet all these city mayors try to break down the Second Amendment and use excuses like violence created through other economic means to disarm the public and encourage this turning in of people who might have illegal guns.
[00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:16.081]  of turning in these guns for guest certificates and a whole lot more.
[00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:37.696]  Of course, this particular mayor, Corey, I think his name was, this video is from a couple years ago, but it certainly illustrates a larger trend because they have hundreds of these mayors recruited in these programs to combat urban violence and call for a reining in of guns and promote the atmosphere as though guns were already illegal, when of course they're not.
[00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:52.686]  Now, another very curious case is the missing woman found in the Queen's estate in Sandringham, believed to be murdered, and they've now identified her after a week and a half or so of refusing to identify the woman.
[00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:56.068]  They believe it is now Latvian Alyssa Dimitridou.
[00:13:56.528 --> 00:14:03.973]  Demetra Jiva, 17 years old, from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, which is very near to the Queen's estate there.
[00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:18.304]  Her and her family immigrated from Latvia pretty recently, and it's all very curious, especially since you've got people like the so-called overzealous stalker of the royal family being found
[00:14:18.664 --> 00:14:18.784]  Yes.
[00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:34.562]  We're good to go!
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:13.024]  Contradictory report from what the detective chief is saying because the mother went on record in this article I'm 80% to blame says distraught mother of Latvian girl and royal estate murder mystery Saying she had been fighting with the girl.
[00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:14.045]  She wouldn't live at home.
[00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:25.988]  She dramatically changed her personality after moving to the UK She was arrested in April for stealing with a group of friends then in June or July she said her friends let her into other worrying habits and
[00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:26.789]  Thank you.
[00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:57.362]  The question of why was the body not found for months when the girl went missing in late August through September 2011, we have the fact that the Queen's own people were combing the estate
[00:15:58.303 --> 00:16:07.589]  In the fall, throughout the months of October and November, killer dog disease returned to Sangringham, a mystery seasonal illness that could kill dogs has returned to the Queen's estate.
[00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:18.555]  And it goes on to discuss how they don't know what caused the diseases, but the Queen herself was so worried, she personally requested an Animal Health Trust veterinary investigation.
[00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:22.478]  They put up signs warning the public not to bring their dogs in the area.
[00:16:23.238 --> 00:16:29.562]  And basically, they were investigating the very plots of land where this woman was later found months later.
[00:16:29.902 --> 00:16:37.467]  So why didn't they find the woman, even though the Queen and the other royals continue to have their dog hunts, all these dogs coming over the area?
[00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:39.128]  Why didn't they find the body?
[00:16:39.168 --> 00:16:41.470]  It's certainly a question worth bringing up.
[00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:50.195]  And then you have the fact that the Queen herself solved the mystery of the killer dog bug, which affected dogs at Sangeringham in early December.
[00:16:50.215 --> 00:16:51.316]  December 6th here in this
[00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:52.417]  We're good to go.
[00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:17.014]  But the point is, people were investigating the spots of land and dogs were on the land.
[00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:22.898]  It was, of course, a body eventually found by a dog owner in the public who was walking through the area.
[00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.640]  So, just more questions remain and we'll continue to look at it.
[00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:34.626]  No reason yet here to connect it to the Royal Family, but odd that this body was found on the Royal Estate there in Sandringham.
[00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:41.049]  Now we'll be back after this break with Greg Hunter to discuss all the political events going on.
[00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.770]  But I do want to remind you of our Prison Planet TV specials.

[00:18:58.342 --> 00:19:00.383]  And we are back on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:00.443 --> 00:19:02.704]  We're joined now by Greg Hunter.
[00:19:03.065 --> 00:19:09.288]  His website, USAWatchdog.com, has become one of the leading alternative news websites.
[00:19:09.328 --> 00:19:10.729]  He covers the spectrum, of course.
[00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:16.052]  We'll talk about everything from Ron Paul to the economy to Iran tensions today.
[00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:23.656]  He is neither Democrat nor Republican, liberal or conservative, and he's worked more than nine years as a reporter
[00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:32.099]  And assistant to various mainstream media including ABC News, Good Morning America, CNN, and plenty of others.
[00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.840]  Greg, thanks for joining us now.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.220]  Good to be here.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.581]  Thanks for having me.
[00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:40.702]  So what do you think is most important in the cycle right now?
[00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:45.704]  You've got this article here on the unemployment statistics, but there's plenty more going on.
[00:19:46.468 --> 00:19:52.271]  Well, let's start with what's going on up in with the campaign and the GOP.
[00:19:52.351 --> 00:20:05.777]  I mean, in Iowa, you know, you've covered this already, but there's some tomfoolery and some shenanigans with, you know, trucks that are missing out of Ames, which is where a lot of young people are, which Ron Paul gets about half of those.
[00:20:06.318 --> 00:20:11.620]  And they had, you know, Karl Rove announcing before anybody else could announce who was going to win and by a small margin.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.122]  And, you know, this is like a Tom Clancy novel.
[00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.663]  And I started thinking, why would they do that?
[00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:30.572]  And I started thinking, you know, if they did, and I can't prove it, but boy, there's sure some really questionable things that went on in Iowa, I think they just changed the tone of everything.
[00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:37.137]  They wanted to make sure that Romney had somebody to run against, and boy, they sure can't have him run against Ron Paul.
[00:20:38.018 --> 00:20:42.964]  So I think what they did was they gave him somebody to run against in Santorum.
[00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:45.668]  And now look what's going on up in New Hampshire.
[00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:48.472]  A lot of polls he's finishing near the bottom or at the bottom.
[00:20:48.772 --> 00:20:51.276]  Santorum all of a sudden went from first to worst.
[00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:59.051]  And I just think that it's just, you know, what's been going on and not just the Republicans.
[00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:13.561]  I mean, if you look at the mainstream media last week after the Iowa caucuses, you had the early show on CBS and they talked about a poll and they had, you know, a Romney and a Gingrich, Huntsman, Santorum.
[00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:15.903]  And when you add up all their poll numbers, it came up to 65 percent.
[00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:16.043]  Duh.
[00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:19.562]  And they didn't even talk.
[00:21:19.582 --> 00:21:21.544]  They talked about Michelle Bachmann, who dropped out.
[00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:26.548]  They didn't even talk about Ron Paul, who is at least in second place by a pretty wide margin.
[00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.571]  And I have a theory on that.
[00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:35.136]  My theory is, listen, if they did, the mainstream media, helped Obama get elected, and I think they did.
[00:21:35.876 --> 00:21:37.718]  And I think they did it by what they omitted.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.420]  I think?
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.602]  And I'm not going to sign on to the, you know, the birther thing.
[00:21:59.843 --> 00:22:01.064]  I think he was born in Hawaii.
[00:22:01.324 --> 00:22:05.727]  But what I'm saying is there's a lot about Obama we didn't even find out about.
[00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:06.228]  Why?
[00:22:06.508 --> 00:22:13.114]  Well, we found out about all this stuff with, you know, against, you know, Bush, you know, 43, when he was running for office.
[00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:24.984]  And I just think that the whole mainstream media, if they're liberal-leaning, and I think liberal and conservative both, do not want to run against Ron Paul.
[00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:45.910]  Absolutely, because both sides of the fence have been omitting him, admittedly, from graphics, refusing to cover even where he polls in major mainstream polls, and as you pointed out, the fact he's leading in second in New Hampshire, and now they're trying to prop up, like shark teeth, other candidates once the formerly major candidates dropped out or lost their steam.
[00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.611]  And now you've got Huntsman there coming up with... But, listen, he spent, Huntsman did spend legitimately a lot of time there.
[00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:57.912]  He spent more there according to reports and other people, so I would imagine he would get a, you know, a bump up.
[00:22:57.972 --> 00:23:10.675]  But it's a small state with very few delegates and obviously, as you pointed out as well, they're trying to anoint Romney and more so marginalize Ron Paul even as he would otherwise be able to gain momentum in those major media.
[00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:13.537]  Well, I think they're scaring him for a couple of reasons.
[00:23:13.637 --> 00:23:22.205]  Both parties, both Democrats and Republicans, the Romneys and the Obamas, which that may be what it ends up being, they're scaring him because he gets but half the young people.
[00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:24.787]  They're energizing people who care about what's going on.
[00:23:25.087 --> 00:23:32.474]  The other thing I think is I think Ron Paul would get a lot of disgusted liberals because, you know, a liberal's not going to vote for Romney.
[00:23:32.974 --> 00:23:36.095]  But Ron Paul, who says, well, I don't think we ought to be doing all these wars.
[00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:41.556]  Hey, I think that, you know, in the debates, he says, I think that if you want to talk about racism, look at the court system.
[00:23:41.856 --> 00:23:49.058]  You know, minorities are disproportionately accused of crime and convicted of crime than their white counterparts in the drug world.
[00:23:49.138 --> 00:24:01.321]  Half about, you know, as many whites as blacks are drug users, but yet disproportionately black people and minorities are convicted and sentenced to death for certain crimes at a much higher rate.
[00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:09.994]  And so I think that if you look at somebody like Obama, and he's looking at Romney or Paul, he's saying, oh, please give me Romney.
[00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:12.338]  I mean, he's not going to bring up the banking crisis.
[00:24:12.358 --> 00:24:13.840]  He's not going to bring up the bailouts.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.745]  I mean, you know, Romney, hey, corporations are people too, man.
[00:24:17.572 --> 00:24:24.637]  And I think if you look at both sides of the issue and the CBS thing, listen, they spend a lot of money on these morning shows.
[00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:30.501]  This is not just a misspelled word in a graphic or they were talking about somebody without their picture.
[00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:31.742]  They omitted him.
[00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:35.744]  They talked about somebody who dropped out of the race, Michelle Bachman.
[00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:38.806]  And they didn't talk about the number two contender.
[00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:43.489]  And the number two contender by eight votes in Iowa was Santorum.
[00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:47.052]  He's almost in last place or is in last place in many polls.
[00:24:47.732 --> 00:24:48.512]  That's unbelievable.
[00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:49.293]  That's outrageous.
[00:24:49.913 --> 00:24:57.455]  Well, if it was the first time it happened, maybe it could have been a coincidence, but it's happened dozens of times on all the different networks, and now it's the day before the voting.
[00:24:58.015 --> 00:25:12.300]  They've got cartoons out, you know, there's one famous one, I think a pretty telling cartoon, it's a guy with a camera and his lens goes up, over, down, a guy, you know, a caricature of Ron Paul, and Ron Paul's like, excuse me, they just look past him.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.721]  And, you know, what the country needs, you will not fix
[00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:21.244]  The unemployment situation, in my humble opinion, without fixing the financial system in the banks.
[00:25:21.485 --> 00:25:23.566]  You can't have the banks have phony accounting.
[00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:25.687]  You can't be with the continued bailout.
[00:25:25.707 --> 00:25:31.791]  We gave Bank of America last year $200 billion in forgiveness and debt taken off their books.
[00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:32.712]  $200 billion.
[00:25:32.932 --> 00:25:36.735]  One bank, Bank of America, last year through Fannie and Freddie.
[00:25:37.055 --> 00:25:38.096]  Not a word about that.
[00:25:38.356 --> 00:25:43.179]  You'll hear the people on Fox News and Fox Business, Solyndra, $500 million.
[00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:45.300]  Somebody should be in jail and they're right.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.101]  Somebody should be in jail.
[00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:47.521]  We're good to go.
[00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.370]  I'll never know, and I think, well, I do know.
[00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.213]  I think it's because they're afraid if they start prosecuting these guys, they'll crash the system.
[00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:36.401]  According to William Black, who is a professor of economics and law and former banking regulator during the RTC crisis, he says this is 70 times bigger than the SNL crisis.
[00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:37.241]  70 times bigger.
[00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:43.905]  And back then they had 10,000 indictments, they had more than 1,000 successful prosecutions, not of clerks of
[00:26:45.526 --> 00:26:49.430]  You know, financial elites, including a sitting governor of a state in Arkansas.
[00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:51.212]  And what do we have this time?
[00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:52.053]  Zero!
[00:26:52.493 --> 00:27:04.605]  We do have Obama on 60 Minutes with Steve Croft at the beginning of December saying, oh, you know, I think they did unethical things, but they didn't do anything illegal.
[00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:05.246]  Really?
[00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:06.699]  They didn't do anything illegal?
[00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:20.604]  They packaged liar loans, they put them into a security, they knew they were liar loans, they rated them equal to a treasury when they were toxic, and we have an ongoing foreclosure crisis where they forge documents so they can go in and take the house.
[00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:21.785]  They didn't do anything illegal?
[00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:24.230]  Outrageous!
[00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:30.136]  And Steve Kroft, who's supposed to be, you know, the cutting edge of journalism, he doesn't know to say, hey, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:37.084]  Well, at the very least, Kroft could have said, with all deference to the president, well, what unethical thing do you think they did?
[00:27:38.405 --> 00:27:38.926]  But nothing!
[00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:43.510]  Just a free pass to say whatever you want to 12 million people to 60 Minutes audiences.
[00:27:43.551 --> 00:27:52.880]  That's the reason why we have what's going on is that, as you guys know, InfoWars, which I'm glad you guys are out there, is because we don't have a fair and impartial media.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.122]  Thank goodness for the internet.
[00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:55.203]  I hope they don't shut it down.
[00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:59.819]  I mean, it's well beyond a lack of fair and balanced coverage.
[00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:04.722]  It's the system propping up this illusion, whether it's in the economic realm, the voting realm.
[00:28:05.002 --> 00:28:10.845]  I mean, what is the real reason they're not interested in fixing the real problems, but just selling us on lies that things are getting better?
[00:28:11.345 --> 00:28:15.848]  I mean, you see it in your article today with the unemployment statistics, but it's systematic.
[00:28:16.408 --> 00:28:23.633]  Well, the unemployment statistics is one of the many ways they basically go to academia.
[00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:25.915]  Academia says, oh, you're doing unemployment wrong.
[00:28:25.935 --> 00:28:27.536]  Really, you need to cut out this and this and this.
[00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:28.877]  You need to seasonally adjust that.
[00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:31.078]  And really, the unemployment rate is 8.5%.
[00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:44.348]  But if you did unemployment the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics did it in 1994 and earlier, this is according to John Williams at shadowstats.com, the real unemployment, the true unemployment rate, the way it was done in 94 or earlier, is 22.4%.
[00:28:46.497 --> 00:28:47.998]  That's unemployed, underemployed.
[00:28:48.659 --> 00:29:01.407]  And if you look at economists like John Williams, who sells his information, not just to readers like me, or just to John Q. Public, but he basically has been in bread and butter, and his client list is secret, but it's hedge funds, big money people.
[00:29:01.487 --> 00:29:12.855]  Nobody would ever make a decision, a money decision, based on information derived by the BLS, by GDP, or by unemployment numbers, where we're heading.
[00:29:13.055 --> 00:29:14.836]  Nobody would ever, and they don't.
[00:29:15.216 --> 00:29:16.237]  Trust me, they do not.
[00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:23.862]  And, you know, John Williams says we're doing nothing more than bottom-bouncing, and the economy's in a severe downturn.
[00:29:23.902 --> 00:29:27.384]  And, you know, that's the other thing, that these numbers, the unemployment, only 8.5%.
[00:29:27.464 --> 00:29:29.645]  That means, like, you know, 92.5% of people, or, you know, excuse me, 91.5% of people are working!
[00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:37.051]  Well, not true!
[00:29:37.071 --> 00:29:42.094]  And that doesn't even count the people that took a less job full-time that took a 20% pay cut.
[00:29:42.454 --> 00:29:44.275]  But let's talk about Bill Gross.
[00:29:44.355 --> 00:29:52.659]  Bill Gross, who is the head of PIMCO, and they have $1.3 trillion under management.
[00:29:53.019 --> 00:30:04.245]  And Bill Gross talks about, you know, that there's, you know, what's happening in the financial markets and economy is like cancer, and it could basically, you know, rearrange economic life as we know it.
[00:30:05.045 --> 00:30:08.327]  But he's referring to some sort of meltdown.
[00:30:08.587 --> 00:30:14.470]  He closes his 2012 preview, and I've got to read this just the way he said it.
[00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:22.234]  This is his last line in his 2012 preview, and this is a guy that manages $1.3 trillion of money.
[00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:26.336]  Financial markets and global economy are at great risk.
[00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:34.375]  This is his preview of 2012, and my question is, what does he say to his friends and family?
[00:30:36.055 --> 00:30:36.635]  Buy gold?
[00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:38.776]  Stock up on water?
[00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:39.836]  Bandages?
[00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:40.436]  Medicine?
[00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:44.137]  I mean, bearish isn't even a word for it.
[00:30:44.337 --> 00:30:45.237]  It's doomsday.
[00:30:45.297 --> 00:30:45.937]  It's gloomy.
[00:30:46.257 --> 00:30:48.358]  And this is a guy with a lot of money under management.
[00:30:48.798 --> 00:30:56.582]  And if you take a look at Jim Rogers, who cavalierly said recently just after the first year on CNBC, and I love the European edition of CNBC.
[00:30:56.643 --> 00:30:58.143]  It's much better than the American version.
[00:30:58.584 --> 00:31:00.685]  You're likely to learn a lot more on the European version.
[00:31:00.745 --> 00:31:07.829]  And Rogers, you know, he was talking about how they're going to make us feel good in Europe, and they're going to, you know, extend some more money, and they're actually loaning money.
[00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:09.650]  They're adding debt for the debt crisis.
[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.211]  They're not really, you know, writing any debt down.
[00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:13.392]  Nobody's taking any losses.
[00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:22.174]  And he says, but you know, this is going to be disastrous for all of us and come the end of 2012, fall of 2012, I'd be very worried.
[00:31:22.534 --> 00:31:25.376]  And he's not the only one making these dire predictions at the end of 2012.
[00:31:25.856 --> 00:31:32.280]  And forget the Mayan calendar, the math of the economy is not good at the end of 12 or the beginning of 13.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:42.730]  Ray Dalio at Bridgewater Associates, you know, a few months ago, this kind of got swept aside, was that he said that he thinks that he's got $80 billion, $100 billion under management.
[00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.931]  This is a big money guy.
[00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:46.814]  And he thinks there'll be another collapse at the end of 12 or beginning of 13.
[00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:48.716]  Hmm, just like Jim Rogers.
[00:31:49.456 --> 00:31:51.438]  And, you know, he predicted the last collapse in 08.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.461]  Pretty right on the money.
[00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:59.965]  And this one will be far worse, according to people like Nassim Taleb, Peter Schiff, you know, multiple people.
[00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:03.627]  And this is like a blue pill world of the Matrix.
[00:32:04.147 --> 00:32:06.709]  People are just, you know, plugged in with something in the back of their head.
[00:32:08.109 --> 00:32:12.532]  Just, you know, watching American Idol and watching tape in their favorite TV shows.
[00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:13.833]  It's unbelievable.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:23.024]  Well, what will the Iran war do if that kicks off, just economically speaking, when oil prices are driven up, you know, above the threshold?
[00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:29.867]  Well, I think they're telegraphing they're going to have war and it's going to be okay, and they don't want the price of oil to spike.
[00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:40.272]  And why I say that is because it just came out just recently, the last few days, that Saudi Arabia, who wants the United States to drop a daisy cutter on Iran's head,
[00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:45.470]  We just sold them, what, $60 billion worth of F-15 fighter jets, right?
[00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.114]  A big sale of defense equipment.
[00:32:49.895 --> 00:32:50.936]  Actually, offensive equipment.
[00:32:50.956 --> 00:32:52.258]  It could be defensive, but offensive.
[00:32:52.278 --> 00:32:53.339]  A fighter jet.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.685]  But they said that they're going to have other routes for their oil, so it won't be cut off.
[00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:07.483]  And I'm thinking, boy, you know, they got all these Yemeni al-Qaeda fighters, you know, south of, you know, Saudi Arabia.
[00:33:08.044 --> 00:33:10.985]  You know, Iran has had a lot of time to think about this.
[00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:13.047]  No, their Navy is no match for the U.S.
[00:33:13.107 --> 00:33:13.287]  Navy.
[00:33:13.815 --> 00:33:16.196]  But they're going to have asymmetrical warfare.
[00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:18.698]  What's going to happen to insurance rates of tankers?
[00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:33.626]  If they say, any tanker we see, the United States may be able to get some ships through, but any tank, any ship, we can put C4 under the hull, take a speedboat with an RPG and fire it into the cabin, whatever we can do to slow this down.
[00:33:33.646 --> 00:33:35.507]  Could you imagine the insurance rates on tankers?
[00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:38.909]  If there is full-blown, we're going to shut down all the traffic we can?
[00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:41.690]  Try to take whatever oil you can somewhere else.
[00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:54.473]  This is an immense, enormous amount of oil, and it's not going to be easy, and it's not going to be very secretive to where they take this pathway, you know, to get it out through the Red Sea or, you know, so it can go up through the Suez Canal, but that's going to be tough.
[00:33:55.873 --> 00:34:03.435]  I think the price of oil could be eight or nine, the price of gas could be eight or nine bucks a gallon, and, you know, in the 90s we could take this hit.
[00:34:04.153 --> 00:34:05.835]  In the 70s, we could take this hit.
[00:34:06.015 --> 00:34:12.802]  Now, we have four banks, just four banks with $235 trillion in derivatives.
[00:34:13.182 --> 00:34:20.609]  Do you think all those derivative contracts will be bilaterally netted and hedged out and settled perfectly if we go to war?
[00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:27.215]  Do you think all those contracts in Europe with the sovereign debt will do just hunky-dory dandy in the trillions of dollars?
[00:34:28.016 --> 00:34:28.537]  I say no!
[00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:31.505]  Well, what happens if China jumps in?
[00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:32.065]  That's the other thing.
[00:34:32.105 --> 00:34:33.786]  It's not going to be just us against Iran.
[00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.227]  I think Russia jumps in.
[00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:41.450]  China has said on state television that they would come to Iran's assistance, even if it meant World War III.
[00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.472]  Now, that wasn't an official position, but it came out on China's state-run television.
[00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:48.934]  I think China... that's a big problem.
[00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:54.497]  Yeah, obviously World War III is a scenario that could play, I mean, Syria and all the other chessboard pieces.
[00:34:54.517 --> 00:34:54.797]  Oh, yeah!
[00:34:55.646 --> 00:34:59.929]  It's Santorum was talking about we're going to degrade those systems and I wanted David Gregory to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:00.490]  Hold on a minute.
[00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.691]  So you're willing to risk World War III?
[00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:08.015]  And you know, the military generals, a lot of the generals and admirals in the Navy, they think bad juju.
[00:35:08.055 --> 00:35:09.276]  They think this is a bad idea.
[00:35:09.296 --> 00:35:10.717]  And it is a bad idea.
[00:35:10.737 --> 00:35:13.459]  Because you unleash the dogs of war.
[00:35:13.499 --> 00:35:14.720]  You don't know what's going to happen.
[00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.153]  I mean, really, you don't know the wild cards that are going to happen.
[00:35:18.453 --> 00:35:20.235]  It will not go according to plan.
[00:35:20.255 --> 00:35:35.069]  It will not go, and listen, I'm as American as can be, but if this scene gets out of hand and it doesn't go perfectly, and I don't see how it can, that I think it could crash the world economy, and that's the black swan, that's a flock of black swans.
[00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:38.472]  That is the wild card of wild card, I've been calling it.
[00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:56.813]  How long do you think the American economy and the European economy, you know, with the gasoline here at $9 to $8 a gallon, if you get it, or $15 or $16 to the liter or to the gallon over in the European, how long do you think those economies will last with sky-high gasoline and fuel prices?
[00:35:58.223 --> 00:36:02.406]  Well, in closing, Greg Hunter, tomorrow is the New Hampshire primary vote.
[00:36:02.726 --> 00:36:05.087]  Do you think people should be watching for voter fraud?
[00:36:05.147 --> 00:36:07.228]  Are they trying to keep Ron Paul's name out of the headlines?
[00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:07.448]  Absolutely.
[00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:08.929]  I hope people in New Hampshire get on it.
[00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.530]  You know, they're the granite state.
[00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:19.516]  I'll tell you a very unusual statistics that I heard, and that is the best-funded candidate up in New Hampshire does not always win.
[00:36:19.576 --> 00:36:21.377]  In fact, it's kind of a rare thing.
[00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:22.237]  They don't always win.
[00:36:22.257 --> 00:36:24.979]  There's been huge surprises in New Hampshire.
[00:36:25.479 --> 00:36:28.182]  And so, yes, I think you ought to watch out for voter fraud.
[00:36:28.202 --> 00:36:31.324]  At least with this one, the people are voting for the candidate.
[00:36:31.384 --> 00:36:32.065]  It's a primary.
[00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:37.349]  Instead of, you know, the caucus goers are voting for other people who are going to vote for the candidate.
[00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:42.854]  In this case, it's the direct vote by New Hampshire to the candidates, and we'll see how it goes.
[00:36:43.752 --> 00:36:43.952]  Right.
[00:36:44.533 --> 00:36:46.834]  Well, Greg Hunter, we'll speak to you again soon, I'm sure.
