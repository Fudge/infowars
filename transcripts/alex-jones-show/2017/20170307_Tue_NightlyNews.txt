[00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.671]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:22.977]  It's Tuesday, March 7th, 2017.
[00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.864]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:33.081]  Tonight, do you trust the mainstream news media?
[00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:44.332]  Well, a new poll suggests that the majority of Americans now believe the establishment media is the primary political opponent to President Donald Trump.
[00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:54.941]  Meanwhile, former CIA Director Michael Hayden says it's the pro-Trump conservative media that is responsible for fake news.
[00:00:55.962 --> 00:01:02.508]  Then, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts.
[00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.710]  Read them and weep, mainstream media.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:18.970]  So the day before the biggest story of the year so far drops, we have former CIA Director Michael Hayden slamming the pro-Trump media for what he says peddling illegitimate and non-fact-based worldviews.
[00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:31.999]  This is just a day before WikiLeaks dropped Vault 7 to give us the fact-based worldview that, of course, the former CIA director would like to hide and bury back into the vault.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.542]  But he's, of course, peddling his new book.
[00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:40.705]  So that's why he's come out lambasting, kind of on the riding the coattails of Donald Trump.
[00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:46.889]  And he is really criticizing pro-Donald Trump media such as Breitbart and Infowars.
[00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.952]  He's saying that we are advancing what he deems to be an illegitimate worldview.
[00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:59.496]  He said, I think that the Breitbart and the likes are off the chart in terms of shaping data to meet the preconceptions.
[00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:00.296]  Hmm.
[00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.658]  Well, learned it by watching you, I guess.
[00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:13.283]  He says, you have a Breitbart news story, essentially launching the star fleet of the federal government about one of the most horrible political scandals in American history, if true, and
[00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:18.466]  You know, it's just amazing how WikiLeaks timed this Vault 7.
[00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:33.754]  I seriously doubt they had really any idea what was going to be happening with this whole Russia scandal and Donald Trump calling out former President Barack Obama for wiretapping his phones because all of the information that WikiLeaks has revealed is much worse.
[00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:39.781]  Much worse indeed than these deep state wiretapping Trump towers.
[00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:50.134]  So he goes on to say that he thinks it's very troubling that the president seems to value Breitbart reports over data compiled by intelligence agencies.
[00:04:50.695 --> 00:05:01.708]  This is the former CIA Director Michael Hayden, okay, who was in charge and issued the faulty intel about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:08.075]  Okay, so there on his watch, the tenure-tenure there in these top intelligence positions,
[00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:19.583]  The Iraq War, there was the September 11th terror attacks, the expansion of NSA data collection, and of course, investigations into claims of torture by CIA interrogators.
[00:05:19.603 --> 00:05:20.083]  So you know what?
[00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:27.748]  Why don't you just shush over peddling a non-fact-based worldview because you've tried to cover it up in lies.
[00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.370]  But all of that is now coming to the surface.
[00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:38.456]  And this is why the majority of American citizens, according to a new poll by TIPPTIP,
[00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:40.077]  A new tip poll.
[00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:44.920]  The majority view the establishment media as opposition party to Donald Trump.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.404]  55% of the public said they're very weary from the media's persistently negative coverage of President Trump.
[00:05:51.764 --> 00:05:58.148]  The media has assumed the role of the opposition party, constantly opposing the president and his policies at every turn.
[00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:00.369]  So as we can see, it's starting to take a turn.
[00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.831]  People are getting sick and tired of all the negative news.
[00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:06.953]  And frankly, it's coming back to bite the fake news in the butt.
[00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:16.137]  They've actually had to roll back the fake news agenda, and now they're calling it virtual disinformation.
[00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:17.718]  That's right, VD for short.
[00:06:17.798 --> 00:06:18.559]  So there you go.
[00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.142]  And just to kind of give you an idea about how the mainstream media has become the opposition party,
[00:06:25.882 --> 00:06:34.187]  Like I said, the biggest story so far of 2017, you will not see it at all on CNN, MSNBC, it's nada.
[00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:36.188]  There's nowhere to be found on the front page.
[00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:42.552]  WikiLeaks unveils Vault 7, the largest ever publication of confidential CIA documents.
[00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:48.095]  This is including more than 8,000 documents and it's allegedly emerged
[00:06:48.675 --> 00:07:04.791]  From the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, and you can view it there at Wikileaks, but it reveals details of the CIA's global covert hacking program, including weaponized exploits used against company products, including Apple's iPhone,
[00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:14.459]  Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows even Samsung TVs which are turned into covert microphones Now Alex Jones has been talking about this.
[00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:27.170]  I know Paul Joseph Watson has been reporting about this for at least 12 years and that's right everybody the truth is Stranger and crazier than Alex Jones if you can believe that because now here it is.
[00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.833]  He's been telling you it's he's not special and
[00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:35.159]  It's in their papers right there if you just do a little digging and see what they're up to.
[00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:39.404]  But WikiLeaks has confirmed that
[00:07:40.703 --> 00:07:43.464]  This technology will rock the world.
[00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:50.308]  The CIA has managed to bypass encryption on popular phone and messaging services such as Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
[00:07:51.608 --> 00:08:02.213]  The source notes that it collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques that they stole from malware that was produced in other states, including the Russian Federation.
[00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:07.916]  And Kim.com actually has been doing some pretty great tweets about this whole dossier.
[00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:14.902]  Summarizing, the CIA uses techniques to make cyber attacks look like they originated from enemy state.
[00:08:15.382 --> 00:08:19.947]  It turns the DNC Russia hack allegation by the CIA into a total joke.
[00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:29.535]  Because this is, according to a new project identified as Umbridge, they are able to make it appear as if a hack
[00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:34.719]  originates from any enemy state that they so choose, like Russia.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.240]  So it is a total joke.
[00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:38.222]  So this project is identified as Umbrage.
[00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:47.189]  It's maintained a substantial library of Russian cyber attack techniques stolen from malware that was produced in other states, including Russian Federation.
[00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:59.378]  It yields a through-the-looking-glass possibility that the Obama administration obtained FISA permission to conduct electronic surveillance of President Trump on the Russians
[00:08:59.898 --> 00:09:02.021]  That they believe to be coordinating with Trump's campaign.
[00:09:02.301 --> 00:09:12.272]  This is based on intelligence that the CIA planted to deceive the NSA into thinking that there was actual cause and contact between Russian agents and the Trump campaign.
[00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:18.319]  Because they can make it originate from anywhere they desire with these projects.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:38.805]  So they say here, this is Jerome Corsi's article, he says possibly what the CIA was monitoring wasn't actual contacts between Russian agents in the Trump campaign, but CIA created counter espionage designed to implicate Trump and provide the legal context for the DOJ to have enough evidence to obtain a FISA green light.
[00:09:39.685 --> 00:09:41.486]  This is a startling revelations here.
[00:09:41.506 --> 00:09:42.826]  We're going to have actually more on this.
[00:09:42.846 --> 00:09:43.727]  We'll do a roundtable.
[00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:45.287]  Owen Schroyer will be in studio.
[00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:49.629]  But what we're learning is that this is much bigger.
[00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:58.632]  CIA, I'm sorry, former NSA whistleblower William Binney is actually saying these spy agencies eavesdrop on Americans without warrants all the time.
[00:09:58.972 --> 00:10:01.453]  And it's ridiculous for them to be putting this narrative out there.
[00:10:02.193 --> 00:10:13.225]  That there's no way that a judge would have ordered this call to wiretap Trump Towers, and that if they did indeed grant permission to surveil Trump Towers, then he must be up to no good.
[00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:14.266]  Please!
[00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:15.888]  Anyone can see right through that.
[00:10:16.188 --> 00:10:21.454]  As we know, these intelligence agencies are just so good at following the Constitution, everybody, aren't they?
[00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:24.297]  They just want us to believe that they're just the good guys in all of this.
[00:10:24.817 --> 00:10:33.546]  So, we also know that the CIA can effectively bypass the encryption that's used in secure texting apps that are popular with whistleblowers and journalists.
[00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:39.990]  They collect audio and text messages on a targeted phone before they're encrypted for another party.
[00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:46.734]  The CIA then can effectively suck up the private data that's sent on Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, and these other secure apps.
[00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:55.539]  And it's a confirmation of a long-standing assumption that intelligence agencies intercepted data after it was transcribed on a keyboard
[00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:58.562]  But before it could be encrypted by software.
[00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:12.735]  on
[00:11:31.698 --> 00:11:36.001]  All of this has now been leaked to WikiLeaks and the world.
[00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:37.422]  All of this information there.
[00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:38.403]  They have such hubris.
[00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:48.830]  They truly think that they are impenetrable and nothing can take them down, which is why they are going full speed to take out Donald Trump because now he's aware of everything that's going on.
[00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:55.355]  He already kind of had an idea, but now he has access to all of that information that before
[00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.817]  He wouldn't have had that access to.
[00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:02.702]  So WikiLeaks is also claiming the CIA targeted Samsung TVs.
[00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.825]  They turned them into microphones in their global hacking program.
[00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:11.791]  It claims Weeping Angel was developed by the CIA's embedded devices branch.
[00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:16.136]  It infests smart TVs and transforms them into covert microphones.
[00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:17.257]  So what they do?
[00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:35.775]  Weeping Angel places the target TV in a fake off mode so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is actually on and in fake off mode the TV operates as a bug recording conversations in the room and then sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server.
[00:12:36.596 --> 00:12:55.909]  According to Judge Andrew Napolitano, the intelligence community is absolutely petrified of a congressional investigation into these claims that Barack Obama spied on Donald Trump because it's going to expose the fact that every single American is under mass surveillance and that our conversations are all being digitally recorded by the NSA.
[00:12:56.369 --> 00:13:06.216]  And Napolitano points out that Obama would not have needed FISA court approval to conduct surveillance of Trump, that he could have simply ordered his attorney general to set it in motion.
[00:13:07.257 --> 00:13:13.341]  Sure, it's immoral and unconstitutional, but such power has resided in the hands of the President since Jimmy Carter.
[00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:32.074]  And like I mentioned earlier, NSA whistleblower William Binney, who is actually the NSA surveillance program architect, told Sean Hannity on Monday that the intelligence community routinely listens in on Americans, all Americans' conversations, without court-ordered FISA warrants.
[00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:36.419]  And, you know, he has come on the Alex Jones Show saying this as well.
[00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:38.301]  It's all done without warrants.
[00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:42.246]  That was testified to by Adrian Kinney and David Murphy Falk.
[00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:47.632]  They were transcribing at Fort Gordon George and they were transcribing conversations between U.S.
[00:13:47.672 --> 00:13:49.354]  citizens with no warrant at all.
[00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:50.315]  But you know what?
[00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:56.061]  Former CIA Director Michael Hayden wants you to think, no, we wouldn't do that.
[00:13:56.121 --> 00:13:57.342]  We're the good guys here.
[00:13:57.743 --> 00:13:59.244]  Now stick around because we're going to have more.
[00:13:59.324 --> 00:14:01.186]  Owen Schroer will be talking in the roundtable.
[00:14:01.206 --> 00:14:05.991]  We're going to also talk about what does this mean for Michael Hastings' mysterious death?
[00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:11.575]  We're good.
[00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:38.429]  Breitbart reports former NSA official, now whistleblower, William Binney, when asked whether he believes the NSA is tapping Trump, Binney replied, Absolutely!
[00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:42.731]  How did they get the phone call between the President and the President of Australia?
[00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:44.753]  Or the one that he made with Mexico?
[00:14:44.973 --> 00:14:45.493]  Indeed!
[00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:51.397]  Remember when Obama tapped the phones of Brazilian President Rousseff and German Chancellor Merkel?
[00:14:51.497 --> 00:14:56.060]  While former Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey speaks from experience.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.043]  Until Congress comes out and says, here's the proof that we now see that there was connections between the Trump campaign and Russians known to U.S.
[00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:03.564]  intelligence.
[00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:08.826]  If and then, and only then, then you would say, because that would be possibly a criminal act, right?
[00:15:08.986 --> 00:15:09.506]  No, it wouldn't.
[00:15:10.267 --> 00:15:13.788]  Even if they had regular contact talking about working together to be Hillary Clinton?
[00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:21.592]  The only statute I know that that conceivably violates is the Logan Act, which hasn't been prosecuted since 1793.
[00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:22.893]  I think the President was not correct.
[00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:29.733]  Certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower.
[00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:38.899]  However, I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the Justice Department through the FISA Court.
[00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:44.083]  They tried to get, apparently, tried to get a wiretap based on their criminal investigation function in June.
[00:15:44.123 --> 00:15:44.943]  That was turned down.
[00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:51.408]  They then tried to get, and got, an order permitting them to conduct electronic surveillance in October.
[00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:52.328]  This is October of 2016.
[00:15:53.989 --> 00:16:15.776]  So that's when apparently that's when it that's when again you're basing of the Sun on news reports as well and on Adam Adam should of course a sycophantic horde of globalist representatives continue to exploit the media President Obama has flatly denied that he has done this and either way Chuck the president's in trouble if he
[00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:19.939]  Falsely spread this kind of misinformation.
[00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:24.622]  I don't know of any president, Democrat or Republican, in the past has done this.
[00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.084]  It shows this president doesn't know how to conduct himself.
[00:16:27.426 --> 00:16:38.735]  I can tell you that it's just ridiculous for the President, President Trump, to say that President Obama would ever order any wire type of an American citizen, any president.
[00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:41.578]  That's just not, we don't do that.
[00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:49.524]  I can't speak officially anymore, but I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI,
[00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:59.272]  There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign.
[00:16:59.913 --> 00:17:10.581]  If you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:17:11.982 --> 00:17:12.362]  No, sir.
[00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:14.404]  It does not?
[00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:17.126]  Not wittingly.
[00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:20.080]  Why is your agency above the law, sir?
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:31.689]  Why can you lie to the Senate about mass surveillance presuming the entire globe to be subject to pervasive collection?
[00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:40.997]  The entire debacle hinges on whether or not the second Pfizer request was granted, an investigation that was confirmed by the media back in November of 2016.
[00:17:41.037 --> 00:17:41.397]  If anything,
[00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.860]  President Trump's reaction is long overdue.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.301]  This is a major priority for the President of the United States.
[00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:52.783]  He directed his intelligence community and national security officials to take this on.
[00:17:53.084 --> 00:17:57.226]  He expects that report to be issued to him before he leaves office.
[00:17:57.608 --> 00:18:00.430]  The question is, how will his successor react?
[00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:07.433]  In January of 2017, BuzzFeed and CNN cooked up the Trump dossier fake news nonsense.
[00:18:07.693 --> 00:18:21.541]  Meanwhile, Obama was expanding the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.
[00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:32.467]  Giving the intelligence community sweeping new powers and diminishing what was left of any right to privacy concerning any targeted private citizen of the United States.
[00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:41.151]  As the deep state gate distraction delaying the restoration of the Republic gets kicked down the road, this circus initiated by the Democrats
[00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:58.324]  Reveals itself as merely a smokescreen to block recused Attorney General Jeff Sessions from formally investigating the Obama slush fund fiasco and a host of villainous activity brimming to the top of the boiling pot of frogs in the District of Criminals.
[00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.365]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:05.718]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.534]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.834 --> 00:23:00.764]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:07.862]  Timothy Reams and Quentin Carter are guests in studio, the first to kick off this new initiative with us.
[00:23:08.382 --> 00:23:24.912]  We're gonna get a lot of other people obviously in studio and on air, but I just had this idea yesterday talking to Q and to Jesse James, and I said we really ought to get the patriots of this country, not just the motorcycle clubs and people that, you know, still believe in the Second Amendment and private property, but the veterans who've been targeted.
[00:23:25.922 --> 00:23:27.704]  By the Democrats, by the globalists.
[00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:44.481]  We've got the reports, I've shown them on air, where DHS domestic terror warning angers the GOP, where they said that we stand by veterans being the number one terror threat in America with no evidence, no metrics, no nothing.
[00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:48.986]  But of course if you're a globalist that have hijacked the country, you're threatened by the veterans.
[00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:58.029]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:23:58.429 --> 00:23:59.189]  They are scum.
[00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:05.273]  And they look at veterans and people and they don't feel confident by seeing manly men or people that are strong enough convictions.
[00:24:05.313 --> 00:24:07.234]  They get pissed because they're criminals.
[00:24:07.534 --> 00:24:10.176]  Of course a criminal mindset hates its veterans.
[00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:25.052]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:24:25.993 --> 00:24:34.239]  Alright, so Tim and Q, you guys, we haven't scripted what we're going to talk about here, just from the heart, where we're at, what other folks you're talking to are saying, where this is going.
[00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:43.185]  Because if listeners and viewers take their, whatever their comment is, hold up a sign in uniform, active duty, you're allowed as active duty to say support the president, you're supposed to under law, aren't you?
[00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:51.251]  To do this, it's so simple, just be Americans, just have solidarity, so these enemies like Chuck Schumer and Pelosi and all of them understand, and Michael Moore,
[00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:52.992]  We're not putting up with it.
[00:24:53.652 --> 00:24:57.755]  So again, we have the famous photos from three years ago, people saying, I'm not going to fight for Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.416]  We've just changed them to an example of what I would do.
[00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:01.737]  Donald Trump is my president.
[00:25:03.718 --> 00:25:04.559]  I am Donald Trump.
[00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.181]  If you all do this on Facebook, Instagram, wherever.
[00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:09.648]  Call into talk radio, wherever.
[00:25:09.728 --> 00:25:10.889]  Go speak at city council.
[00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:11.890]  We need you.
[00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:13.732]  America respects you.
[00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:16.135]  And the country's under attack by globalists.
[00:25:16.396 --> 00:25:18.438]  This is where you're needed in the republic.
[00:25:18.498 --> 00:25:19.699]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.701]  Alright guys, take over.
[00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:21.842]  This is a call to action.
[00:25:21.882 --> 00:25:22.863]  It's time to stand up.
[00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:23.944]  It's time to do the right thing.
[00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:28.429]  Write that same sign, draw that same picture, whatever it is, but this time don't hide your face.
[00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:31.132]  Show the world who you are and that you're proud.
[00:25:31.592 --> 00:25:32.273]  We understand.
[00:25:32.453 --> 00:25:33.934]  Tim was in the Marines, I was in the Army.
[00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:38.259]  There are certain things on your uniform you don't want to show, and we fully understand that.
[00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:41.802]  We don't want anyone to get in trouble for what they do, but there's nothing
[00:25:42.643 --> 00:25:44.605]  Wrong with supporting the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:25:44.905 --> 00:25:46.666]  You know, the UCMJ, all those things.
[00:25:46.987 --> 00:25:47.887]  There's nothing wrong.
[00:25:47.987 --> 00:25:54.353]  There's nothing unlawful about basically saying that you support the man who supports us.
[00:25:54.493 --> 00:25:55.834]  Trump has been great to veterans.
[00:25:56.374 --> 00:25:59.036]  He has been great to the United States of America as a whole.
[00:25:59.657 --> 00:26:04.201]  And I wholeheartedly believe that his mission is to make this place great again.
[00:26:04.721 --> 00:26:07.944]  And so far, in just 45 days or whatever it is,
[00:26:08.584 --> 00:26:12.905]  He's made astronomical changes for the betterment of us.
[00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:14.025]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:26:14.045 --> 00:26:15.285]  That's exactly why they're scared.
[00:26:15.425 --> 00:26:17.106]  The country as a whole stood up and voted.
[00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:19.566]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:24.187]  We've sat back and took it on the chin for eight solid years.
[00:26:24.727 --> 00:26:25.407]  We didn't whine.
[00:26:25.447 --> 00:26:26.328]  We didn't complain.
[00:26:26.388 --> 00:26:27.328]  We didn't protest.
[00:26:27.348 --> 00:26:28.828]  We didn't go up and beat up people.
[00:26:30.408 --> 00:26:36.550]  Veterans didn't go out and attack the LGBT community or anyone else because that's not our style.
[00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.233]  Aggressors were protectors.
[00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.075]  It's how it works.
[00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:45.185]  So now that we've sat back, we've done eight years of this, it's our turn.
[00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:47.366]  We expect the same thing.
[00:26:48.027 --> 00:26:50.248]  You don't have to necessarily agree with what he has to say.
[00:26:50.688 --> 00:26:53.989]  You don't have to wholeheartedly believe in his message.
[00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.090]  But what you do have to do is stop trying to derail the train.
[00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.571]  And getting back to this, I'm sure you guys remember this.
[00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:00.251]  We've talked about it.
[00:27:00.732 --> 00:27:03.773]  Remember when Obama said the number one threat's veterans and returning veterans and gun owners?
[00:27:04.213 --> 00:27:05.293]  Trump reversed that.
[00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:08.735]  Trump team wants anti-terror program to only target radical Islam.
[00:27:08.775 --> 00:27:14.557]  He actually did the order and told him to stop saying the main threat's gun owners and veterans, but it's radical Islam in the country.
[00:27:15.197 --> 00:27:17.538]  Trump delisted the veterans as the enemy.
[00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:24.001]  Yeah, there was a big movement in the veteran community for quite a while when they talked about homegrown terrorists.
[00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:32.346]  Basically talking about how, you know, the veterans who came home from the war are the biggest threat to the United States.
[00:27:32.386 --> 00:27:34.967]  That they are... We need armored vehicles for the veterans.
[00:27:35.327 --> 00:27:42.511]  Because you don't know, because they're unstable, because they have post-traumatic stress, because of all this other crazy bullshit that they wanted to do.
[00:27:42.551 --> 00:27:47.214]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:27:47.254 --> 00:27:48.234]  would you see that happening?
[00:27:48.274 --> 00:27:52.316]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:27:52.596 --> 00:27:59.040]  So what they basically did was put doubt in the mind of those veterans who came home, who are having a hard time.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.921]  It was meant to demoralize them, so they committed suicide.
[00:28:00.941 --> 00:28:01.501]  That's exactly.
[00:28:02.802 --> 00:28:04.242]  I talked to a lot of people about that too.
[00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:18.826]  It's just one of those things where when they started saying that stuff and there were guys that did have actual problems with PTSD and needed to come out and get help, they were afraid to because they had this thought in the back of their mind that they would actually get put on these lists that you're talking about.
[00:28:19.386 --> 00:28:26.687]  And so a lot of them refrained from going out and asking for help because they were afraid of some of the other stuff that they might be looked at differently.
[00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:27.167]  It's a stigma!
[00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:28.728]  They were dehumanizing the veterans.
[00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:29.208]  Exactly.
[00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:42.230]  You know, I served overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and during that time, you know, Obama's eight year reign or presidential, whatever, you know, I supported him wholeheartedly every step of the way.
[00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:47.391]  I might not have agreed with everything that he did, but regardless, he was the commander in chief and so I did what he wanted.
[00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:49.872]  But now I actually see a president that I believe in.
[00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.195]  And, you know, now it's our turn to step together.
[00:28:53.215 --> 00:28:56.898]  The polls and voting and us getting him into office was just the first step.
[00:28:56.938 --> 00:29:00.902]  Now the second step to secure our future, for a better future, we just need to come together.
[00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:08.529]  The veterans need to stand up and, you know, actually go out on air or social media and then just say that they do support Trump.
[00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.071]  And I don't care where they do it.
[00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:12.533]  I've said here, wherever, they all want to do it here.
[00:29:12.813 --> 00:29:15.556]  I just want to see them stand up because the country needs them.
[00:29:15.876 --> 00:29:17.516]  And I talked to a lot of them on the phone whenever I called them.
[00:29:17.536 --> 00:29:22.517]  You know, I actually called a lot of guys up and said, hey, you know, Alex Jones is talking about doing this.
[00:29:22.718 --> 00:29:23.498]  Where do you stand?
[00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:24.978]  And hey, can I fly down tomorrow?
[00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.278]  They actually want to be here.
[00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:28.679]  It's not, you know, twisting their arm or anything like that.
[00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:31.239]  They want to be here because they truly believe in everything that you're saying.
[00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:36.441]  They truly believe in everything that Trump is doing because he is looking out for the better, you know, better for the veterans.
[00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:37.921]  He's looking out for us and he's a.
[00:29:38.661 --> 00:29:42.742]  Even though a lot of Americans won't think he is, he's actually looking out for all of America.
[00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:47.963]  And all the numbers show that concealed carry people are the, normally veterans, the lowest level of crime.
[00:29:48.263 --> 00:29:48.463]  Right.
[00:29:48.623 --> 00:29:49.763]  Like, we're good people!
[00:29:49.983 --> 00:29:50.984]  Leave us the hell alone!
[00:29:51.004 --> 00:29:53.584]  But we're seeing their full push now.
[00:29:53.844 --> 00:29:57.545]  Because they were the attackers before, and so we had the initiative to defeat them.
[00:29:57.585 --> 00:30:01.906]  Now they see it as their corner, which they're not, so they're giving us their full attack.
[00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:06.067]  We have to realize the war only started now, and I'm telling you,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.340]  You do.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.824]  Your children, everybody, absolutely deserve for you to do the right thing.
[00:30:11.844 --> 00:30:12.905]  And it's not work, folks.
[00:30:13.105 --> 00:30:16.647]  The animating contest of liberty that Jefferson talked about is everything.
[00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:18.029]  That's it.
[00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:23.233]  You know, so stand up, be counted, pull your weight, do the right thing.
[00:30:23.653 --> 00:30:24.734]  This is your call to action.
[00:30:24.974 --> 00:30:25.754]  You did a little bit.
[00:30:25.794 --> 00:30:26.475]  We all voted.
[00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:27.736]  The fight is not over.
[00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:28.617]  It's now is the time.
[00:30:28.637 --> 00:30:29.037]  Legendary.
[00:30:29.097 --> 00:30:29.497]  Keep going.
[00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:29.958]  It's true, though.
[00:30:30.298 --> 00:30:32.420]  Legendary history is passing before your eyes.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.420]  Be part of it.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.802]  The energy level is just explosive.
[00:30:35.822 --> 00:30:36.383]  I mean, this is a
[00:30:37.384 --> 00:30:40.148]  I mean I can't stop working 18 hours a day because this is history.
[00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:41.910]  This is the fight between good and evil.
[00:30:42.171 --> 00:30:42.711]  This is it.
[00:30:42.812 --> 00:30:48.219]  There will never be a time in our lives or our children's lives more important than it is right now.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.963]  This makes or breaks the
[00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:58.454]  Everything about America, whether we win or fail, all has right now.
[00:30:58.634 --> 00:31:00.115]  This is what fixes everything.
[00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:02.376]  This decides the motion.
[00:31:02.816 --> 00:31:05.498]  I would like to say one last thing for all the veterans out there.
[00:31:06.618 --> 00:31:07.159]  Don't be afraid.
[00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:08.039]  Stand up.
[00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:11.801]  Don't be afraid to say, yes, I voted for Trump or yes, I support him.
[00:31:12.202 --> 00:31:12.762]  Don't be afraid.
[00:31:12.782 --> 00:31:13.182]  That's right.
[00:31:13.202 --> 00:31:14.043]  Get past the bullying.
[00:31:14.823 --> 00:31:15.223]  Exactly.
[00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:16.204]  He needs help.
[00:31:16.904 --> 00:31:19.266]  Something else to the veteran community while I've got a second to say this.
[00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:24.329]  Yeah, some of us have issues, some of us have had a hard time, some of us have dealt with the war differently.
[00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:26.450]  But understand this, you are not broken.
[00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.011]  You are not worthless.
[00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:29.331]  Don't let them tell you that!
[00:31:29.372 --> 00:31:30.032]  That's a lie!
[00:31:30.512 --> 00:31:39.237]  It's the whole idea of trying to drug us out and keep us hooked on pills and the VA's whole deny your claim until you die.
[00:31:39.257 --> 00:31:41.479]  They just want to use you like a machine and throw you away.
[00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:41.679]  No.
[00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:44.780]  You're going to show them now what you can do.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.520]  That's it.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:51.002]  The same valuable person you were when you signed, when you took that oath, is the same person you need to be today.
[00:31:51.622 --> 00:31:59.144]  You know, you stood up, you put your life on the line, you signed a blank check that you would do anything that needed to be done for the betterment of the country.
[00:31:59.364 --> 00:32:01.905]  And now you've got a chance to really fight for the Republic.
[00:32:01.965 --> 00:32:03.665]  Because everybody joined for great reasons.
[00:32:03.705 --> 00:32:04.186]  We love you.
[00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.186]  None of it's perfect.
[00:32:05.226 --> 00:32:06.426]  But now, this is so pure.
[00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:08.527]  I want to say, this is so damn pure.
[00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:10.729]  I mean, there's like no debating.
[00:32:10.849 --> 00:32:13.871]  It's like, wow, how could you not do your maximum effort?
[00:32:13.891 --> 00:32:19.837]  For all the veterans out there, you know, you no longer now, thanks to Trump, have to worry about that list getting put on some sort of terrorist list.
[00:32:20.137 --> 00:32:24.501]  You know, go to the VA, get the help that you need and just, you know, keep pushing on.
[00:32:24.782 --> 00:32:26.183]  They were threatening veterans to not
[00:32:26.283 --> 00:32:28.765]  Yeah, they absolutely threatened us.
[00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:32.448]  They asked a bunch of questions, you know, when you go in for basic medical stuff.
[00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:33.789]  Oh, you have a cold?
[00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:34.510]  You need some medicine?
[00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.911]  Okay, where are your guns in the house?
[00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:36.751]  Do you have guns?
[00:32:36.792 --> 00:32:37.492]  Do you have this and that?
[00:32:37.912 --> 00:32:40.194]  None of that is any of their business, you know?
[00:32:40.895 --> 00:32:41.495]  Push forward.
[00:32:42.076 --> 00:32:42.536]  Stand up.
[00:32:42.736 --> 00:32:43.277]  Be counted.
[00:32:43.377 --> 00:32:44.398]  Don't be afraid of anything.
[00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:47.743]  Timothy Reams, I know you've got a lot of stuff coming in the future.
[00:32:47.843 --> 00:32:57.680]  Come in with these great patriots, come back in with us, you and Q, and help lead this initiative with Q, just to all these great veterans, to give them a voice here, and other places to inspire others, and together we're unstoppable.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.221]  Thank you, sir.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.351]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:37:08.232 --> 00:37:16.717]  We've known for a long time that Google and Facebook and Apple and others were working with the Communist Chinese to help censor in their own countries.
[00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:29.885]  But now they've openly announced that any pro-Trump news, any pro-America news or information is going to be massively censored.
[00:37:31.104 --> 00:37:37.026]  This is so un-American, it's so authoritarian, it's so dangerous, but it just shows who they are.
[00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:44.169]  And quite frankly, anyone that cares about their family or the country should leave Facebook and dump their stock.
[00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:51.392]  This is such a criminal organization, it's so anti-American, it's been a pump and dump from the beginning.
[00:37:52.682 --> 00:37:55.223]  Look at this USA Today article that came out last night.
[00:37:55.263 --> 00:37:59.964]  This began last night to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:00.764 --> 00:38:03.465]  Facebook begins flagging disputed fake news.
[00:38:03.905 --> 00:38:05.165]  They don't just flag it.
[00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:09.026]  That'd be a mark of honor to have these scumbags mark us as fake.
[00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:13.708]  They don't let us spread our articles now that I'm going to show you.
[00:38:13.748 --> 00:38:18.609]  Paul Watson just covered this the last hour live, the fourth hour of my radio show, TV show.
[00:38:22.415 --> 00:38:33.080]  We covered mainstream news with the House Intelligence Committee head, with top CIA people, you name it, coming out and saying Trump was illegally surveilled.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:42.184]  The CIA in this new Vault 7 data dump by WikiLeaks is spying on the American people worse than the NSA.
[00:38:42.844 --> 00:38:44.705]  Everything Snowden said has been documented.
[00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:46.365]  Everything we've said is documented.
[00:38:46.786 --> 00:38:50.067]  And Facebook's response is to ban it.
[00:38:51.377 --> 00:38:54.261]  None of our articles can get out on Vault 7.
[00:38:56.023 --> 00:38:58.707]  It doesn't matter if they even quote the New York Times.
[00:38:58.887 --> 00:38:59.588]  It's not allowed.
[00:38:59.628 --> 00:39:01.410]  The people can't communicate.
[00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.234]  This is so un-American, so authoritarian.
[00:39:07.165 --> 00:39:08.907]  This article's banned from yesterday.
[00:39:09.007 --> 00:39:14.091]  Former CIA analyst, Obama, gave green light for NSA-CIA sabotage.
[00:39:14.592 --> 00:39:19.136]  It's Fox News and RT with him being interviewed.
[00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.057]  Two different interviews.
[00:39:20.597 --> 00:39:24.981]  This is banned on Paul Joseph Watson's Facebook.
[00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:25.622]  Not mine.
[00:39:26.743 --> 00:39:27.563]  Ours is so big.
[00:39:27.603 --> 00:39:30.386]  But they start with the... His account's got over a million people.
[00:39:30.446 --> 00:39:31.267]  Ours has got two million.
[00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.792]  I mean, this is an admitted former CIA analyst coming out and saying, of course they're spying.
[00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:38.173]  Well, they admit they're spying.
[00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:43.315]  That's what the Vault 7 leak, as the president counters the deep state, says.
[00:39:43.796 --> 00:40:01.045]  So Zuckerberg is totally with Obama, Google, and the deep state that admittedly faked all the returns on the election, still got beat, faked all the info for Hillary, covered up for her, dialed back all the negative searches for her, gave her the questions beforehand, met with CNN beforehand.
[00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:01.765]  That's all admitted.
[00:40:03.752 --> 00:40:04.432]  And do they stop?
[00:40:04.493 --> 00:40:07.995]  No, Zuckerberg says, you're a user, you're a dumb effer.
[00:40:09.676 --> 00:40:16.981]  He has that photo of him walking bipedally, everybody else is in AI, like monkeys, you know, on their knees, looking at his false world.
[00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:18.362]  He lives, we sleep.
[00:40:20.763 --> 00:40:23.685]  Zuckerberg's trying to take native lands in Kauai, Hawaii.
[00:40:24.206 --> 00:40:28.669]  He's just this, Zuckerberg, you won't be safe anywhere, asshole.
[00:40:29.793 --> 00:40:31.094]  You try to bring in global tyranny.
[00:40:31.675 --> 00:40:34.798]  You may get 99% of people living in the Matrix.
[00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.061]  1% will destroy you, dumbass!
[00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:39.163]  Learn to have empathy.
[00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.265]  Learn to have a give and take.
[00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:44.188]  Learn to treat others as you want to be treated, jerk!
[00:40:44.969 --> 00:40:45.890]  You can be a hero!
[00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:48.913]  But you don't want to be, because you think you're better than everybody.
[00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:51.476]  You have that psychotic will against humanity.
[00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.562]  There were over 20 Facebook programs the CIA had.
[00:40:59.062 --> 00:41:00.063]  Zuckerberg was just one of them.
[00:41:00.103 --> 00:41:02.224]  They made him the guy because he was such a sellout.
[00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:08.387]  If you're involved in his stock or his company, you might as well be sold out to the devil.
[00:41:08.407 --> 00:41:12.709]  I know a lot of people grovel to the power structure, but we're beating them right now.
[00:41:12.729 --> 00:41:14.710]  I'm going to get to that in a moment, but here it is.
[00:41:16.131 --> 00:41:18.872]  Facebook begins flagging disputed fake news.
[00:41:21.053 --> 00:41:22.634]  And what is the news they flagged today?
[00:41:23.604 --> 00:41:25.267]  Donald Trump's speech, they banned that.
[00:41:25.587 --> 00:41:27.390]  The President's speech, banned on Facebook.
[00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:31.998]  Top CIA analysts and CIA leaks.
[00:41:33.234 --> 00:41:49.647]  A Volt 7, the largest ever publication of confidential CIA documents, where they admit they're watching you on your smart TV, your iPhone, your Droid, they're remote controlling cars, they're killing Michael Hastings, they're controlling all the data chips in power plants, dams, you name it.
[00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:56.732]  It's all over the news, but they don't want the people that created the original reports, the progenitors.
[00:41:58.373 --> 00:41:59.194]  But guess who called?
[00:41:59.274 --> 00:42:00.075]  Senator Rand Paul.
[00:42:01.448 --> 00:42:03.309]  He called us today and he said, I want to come on.
[00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:04.809]  Hadn't called me in over a year.
[00:42:05.549 --> 00:42:16.672]  I got a call from clandestine groups in the CIA yesterday and today saying, we just want you to know we're aware of what's happening.
[00:42:16.692 --> 00:42:17.672]  We're going to defeat these people.
[00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:25.075]  So I just want Zuckerberg and Zuckey and Schmidt and all these people who think they're going to beat humanity.
[00:42:25.775 --> 00:42:26.375]  Feel your hand.
[00:42:26.955 --> 00:42:28.316]  You, you creature.
[00:42:29.156 --> 00:42:32.038]  Because you think you're going to censor the president?
[00:42:32.638 --> 00:42:34.959]  You think you're going to surveil the president and not have him talk about it?
[00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:40.162]  He's the reason Vault 7 came out and everything we're covering with Vault 7.
[00:42:40.202 --> 00:42:43.764]  See, they've got digital stuff that bans keywords.
[00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.351]  But they don't have stuff banning video feeds yet.
[00:42:47.371 --> 00:42:52.494]  We're on Facebook and Google and YouTube and Periscope and a bunch of other platforms right now.
[00:42:52.534 --> 00:42:53.835]  We expect them to censor this.
[00:42:54.255 --> 00:42:56.717]  But we're going to fight on to show everybody what's happening.
[00:42:57.437 --> 00:42:59.718]  But Facebook doesn't want you to see this video.
[00:43:00.299 --> 00:43:00.739]  Spread it.
[00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:01.279]  Copy it.
[00:43:01.319 --> 00:43:01.660]  Get it out.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.640]  They'll never stop you.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.101]  Don't be afraid of their censorship.
[00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:05.462]  Stand up for what's right.
[00:43:05.702 --> 00:43:06.462]  Do the right thing.
[00:43:08.424 --> 00:43:09.024]  Look at this article.
[00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:15.563]  Facebook has begun flagging fake news, or as Facebook calls it, disputed news.
[00:43:16.123 --> 00:43:30.055]  If they dispute that Vault 7 documents from the CIA have been released, that they admit are real, if they dispute that documents were released that Facebook's surveilling on people and selling the data, they'll just block it.
[00:43:30.135 --> 00:43:33.298]  Well, but they won't block all the Obama and CNN garbage.
[00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:39.997]  The giant social network, this is USA Today, first promised to roll out a disputed tag in December.
[00:43:40.277 --> 00:43:43.079]  Over the weekend it made its debut and the U.S.
[00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:45.522]  Facebook declined to comment.
[00:43:46.743 --> 00:43:48.264]  They just hope we accept it and go away.
[00:43:49.005 --> 00:43:56.872]  Among the disputed offenders, the people spotted on Facebook, a fictionalized story from Trump's Android device believed to be the source of recent White House leaks.
[00:43:59.773 --> 00:44:01.674]  You can Google this while it's still available.
[00:44:02.314 --> 00:44:12.277]  You can Google 20th Century Fox put out hundreds of fake news articles about myself, Matt Drudge, and Trump in the last three months, saying horrible stuff we never said.
[00:44:12.877 --> 00:44:18.619]  They're the ones putting it out, then they use what they've done to then censor us.
[00:44:20.478 --> 00:44:33.326]  Among the disputed offenders, spotted on Facebook, a fictionalized story, Trump's Android device, believed to be the source of recent White House leaks, from a fictionalized publication of the Seattle Tribune, which, again, was a 20th Century Fox.
[00:44:33.406 --> 00:44:40.550]  I said last week, they're going to use their own fake news to censor us.
[00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:45.973]  The story carried a disputed label with links to fact-check services that explain why it was not true.
[00:44:45.993 --> 00:44:48.595]  With us, they're just blocking us.
[00:44:49.693 --> 00:44:57.156]  The website is a disclaimer that the news entertainment satire web publication, yeah, 20th Century Fox, but the story fooled people anyway.
[00:44:57.416 --> 00:45:03.019]  So the big corporate Hollywood whores that hate America put out some fake news and then we get banned.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.641]  They give them the cover they need to say there's fake news, see?
[00:45:09.262 --> 00:45:18.086]  The disputed tag is part of Facebook's grand plan to crack down on fake news as the company tries to tap down on the controversy over its role and the spread of misinformation that shaped political
[00:45:19.161 --> 00:45:22.965]  Divisions and inflamed discourse during and after President's election.
[00:45:23.326 --> 00:45:26.990]  They let all the leftists, all the hateful anti-American groups do whatever they wanted.
[00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.852]  They blocked us all during the election.
[00:45:29.973 --> 00:45:32.796]  But now they're doing it because they got attacked.
[00:45:32.936 --> 00:45:34.558]  Oh, they're being nonpartisan.
[00:45:34.618 --> 00:45:35.559]  No, they're a fraud.
[00:45:38.356 --> 00:45:42.040]  They're gonna run out of flags, joked one Facebook user.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.724]  Guaranteed, the people who share fake news all the time will use this to say they're censored.
[00:45:47.085 --> 00:45:47.505]  Oh, see?
[00:45:47.805 --> 00:45:48.806]  Nobody sues me.
[00:45:49.107 --> 00:45:50.268]  Nobody proves I'm wrong.
[00:45:50.488 --> 00:45:52.270]  Nobody shows what I'm saying's a fraud.
[00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:56.114]  They just say, oh, you're bitching because we don't let you share your info.
[00:45:57.475 --> 00:46:01.178]  Or that Facebook is forcing liberal bias down their throats.
[00:46:01.198 --> 00:46:03.259]  They just got caught in the WikiLeaks working for Hillary.
[00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:04.380]  Comment another.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.303]  I expect to strengthen their resolve, not make them see their bias for what it is.
[00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:14.267]  Facebook has been reluctant to put itself in the position of judging what content is misleading.
[00:46:14.507 --> 00:46:17.028]  They've always been censoring viral Patriot stuff.
[00:46:17.269 --> 00:46:18.289]  They've always been doing it.
[00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:19.690]  Now they're doing it openly.
[00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.591]  More lies.
[00:46:21.673 --> 00:46:29.668]  Resisting calls has become the de facto news publisher exercising editorial judgment with the power to say what the minds of billions.
[00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:34.738]  Drudge said it when he visited us a few, a month, a year and a half ago.
[00:46:35.158 --> 00:46:36.679]  He said they want to block all of us.
[00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:38.460]  It's got to be Infowars.com.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.981]  It's got to be DrudgeReport.com.
[00:46:41.021 --> 00:46:43.242]  We cannot trust Facebook or Twitter or any of them.
[00:46:43.602 --> 00:46:45.643]  They want us on their platforms to censor us.
[00:46:45.963 --> 00:46:49.365]  We have to get listeners to come to us and spread our links.
[00:46:49.745 --> 00:46:51.926]  But now they're saying they won't even let it go through telecoms.
[00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:56.308]  The next move is to block pro-Trump or pro-American news over the internet, period.
[00:46:57.709 --> 00:46:59.390]  So you put up with this, they win.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.060]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:05.455 --> 00:49:10.557]  Well, after weeks of teasing about it, WikiLeaks has finally unveiled Vault 7.
[00:49:10.817 --> 00:49:15.438]  It is essentially the largest ever publication of confidential CIA documents.
[00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:24.061]  Now, Julian Assange was set to speak about Year Zero on Facebook today, but a live stream of the event was reportedly hacked.
[00:49:24.181 --> 00:49:24.721]  Wouldn't you know it?
[00:49:24.781 --> 00:49:29.783]  So it's not clear if this event has been rescheduled or not, but very interesting there.
[00:49:31.403 --> 00:49:36.227]  That the live stream event gets hacked because this is key information.
[00:49:36.547 --> 00:49:40.430]  You're not going to find it on CNN or MSNBC, NBC.
[00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:59.445]  They're all talking about Obamacare lite, which yes, that is a huge story, but they are just going to roll all of these non-issues with the Russia hacking and Trump's tweets of the week and everything and just completely try and bury this story so that most of your people in middle America and elsewhere will never get access to it.
[00:49:59.605 --> 00:50:00.306]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:50:00.366 --> 00:50:02.048]  I wonder if they knew it was coming.
[00:50:02.308 --> 00:50:08.015]  After all, we know the access they have to basically any digital information that ever existed.
[00:50:08.696 --> 00:50:12.800]  But it's funny you mentioned about the hack of the WikiLeaks planned broadcast.
[00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:19.208]  A lot of people were reporting issues on Twitter when they tried to tweet hashtag Vault 7, myself included.
[00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:22.510]  I had a tweet that I was trying to get out with hashtag Vault 7.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:26.173]  I had to retry it about nine or ten times just to get it out.
[00:50:26.613 --> 00:50:32.978]  And I had people sending me tweets at the time saying, hey, I'm getting this internal server error every time I try to tweet with hashtag Vault 7.
[00:50:33.578 --> 00:50:34.399]  I love Jack.
[00:50:34.419 --> 00:50:36.801]  He's always suppressing any real information.
[00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:39.142]  You know, he's on behalf of the deep state there.
[00:50:39.162 --> 00:50:43.886]  So people, you've got to maybe misspell it so that you can kind of game the game system there.
[00:50:44.406 --> 00:50:52.015]  Well, speaking of Twitter, Kim Dotcom got on Twitter and tweeted, Of course, Kim Dotcom has good sources that know this type of thing.
[00:51:01.567 --> 00:51:18.320]  He was able, actually he was able to find that out because he, in order to build his case, he was able to receive all of the documents and that was how he found out that they were actually using his phone, his camera, his microphone and everything to spy on him in a copyright case.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.046]  So that's why Kim Dotcom has been really vocal about all of this saying, man, Donald Trump, if you only knew that.
[00:51:25.327 --> 00:51:30.933]  I mean, this is going against Kim Dotcom, who's never even been inside of the United States of America.
[00:51:31.334 --> 00:51:32.535]  So they're spying on him.
[00:51:33.095 --> 00:51:34.837]  You know, obviously, they try to say that they're going to.
[00:51:35.538 --> 00:51:39.163]  You know, obey the Constitution and not spy on the rest of us Americans here.
[00:51:39.243 --> 00:51:44.490]  But, I mean, it's just insane what we have learned just in this first little drop of Vault 7.
[00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.393]  Well, and that's the key of it, too.
[00:51:46.693 --> 00:51:50.678]  This WikiLeaks Vault 7 has not even been on the internet for 24 hours yet.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.223]  And this is a document with, I think, 8,000 pages or something crazy like that.
[00:51:56.283 --> 00:51:56.883]  All kinds of stuff.
[00:51:56.903 --> 00:51:57.844]  People are scanning through it.
[00:51:57.884 --> 00:52:01.086]  So we're starting to get some of the details on some of the things like Umbrage.
[00:52:01.146 --> 00:52:02.807]  I know that you talked about that earlier.
[00:52:02.847 --> 00:52:10.332]  But no, you know, and the other thing, just to add to the Kim Dotcom tweet, all of us would go ballistic if we knew what was going on.
[00:52:10.352 --> 00:52:11.212]  Right.
[00:52:11.332 --> 00:52:13.814]  Now we have the WikiLeaks.
[00:52:13.894 --> 00:52:15.175]  Now we have the Intel.
[00:52:15.655 --> 00:52:16.376]  Now, the crazy thing.
[00:52:16.416 --> 00:52:18.157]  Now, here's the interesting part about this, Leanne.
[00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:26.075]  You know, you and I have known this, Alex Jones has known this, the Infowarriors have known this, people who are quote-unquote woke have known this, red-pilled, right?
[00:52:26.095 --> 00:52:35.700]  I mean, anybody, I mean, even the average individual, I feel like, would say, you know what, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, whoever it is, can probably access my phone, access my camera.
[00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:39.462]  It just kind of is common sense, kind of like a duh factor now.
[00:52:39.903 --> 00:52:41.624]  Okay, but now it's real.
[00:52:42.244 --> 00:52:42.624]  I don't know.
[00:53:01.218 --> 00:53:06.040]  The CIA programs where they look into hacking cars, getting access to cars.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:14.923]  Of course, with the modern day smart car, that means you can steer it, that means you can shut it down, that means you can speed it up, slow it down, break it, whatever you need to do.
[00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:17.344]  Probably change the radio station if you're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:53:17.364 --> 00:53:22.947]  We've seen your average hacker doing this already, so this is not some far off dystopian future.
[00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:28.209]  They're already showing you, hackers, there's video of it out there on YouTube, this is already happening.
[00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:31.332]  They're already taking control of the smart cars.
[00:53:31.352 --> 00:53:37.418]  So why is the CIA interested in this type of technology to engage in nearly undetectable assassination?
[00:53:37.498 --> 00:53:39.060]  And let's be real about this.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.401]  This isn't just about cars.
[00:53:40.481 --> 00:53:41.443]  This is about planes.
[00:53:41.463 --> 00:53:42.384]  This is about trains.
[00:53:42.404 --> 00:53:43.425]  This is about anything.
[00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:44.526]  Anything attackable.
[00:53:44.546 --> 00:53:45.166]  Your television.
[00:53:45.247 --> 00:53:46.408]  Yeah, your television.
[00:53:46.508 --> 00:53:47.849]  Anything on the Internet of Things.
[00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.775]  I don't know why you filled your home with all those smart appliances.
[00:54:05.714 --> 00:54:09.856]  Look at the details that we need to get to the bottom of here and I don't know if we'll ever be able to.
[00:54:10.056 --> 00:54:11.937]  Let's get back to Hastings for a second.
[00:54:12.277 --> 00:54:17.920]  So Michael Hastings is worried about how he's being looked at by the FBI.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.202]  He's in fear for his life because he's about to break this huge story.
[00:54:21.602 --> 00:54:25.344]  He's emailing family and friends saying, hey, I think I'm being watched.
[00:54:25.464 --> 00:54:26.925]  I need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:27.965]  I'm getting out of town.
[00:54:28.446 --> 00:54:33.548]  All of a sudden his car speeds and blows up and now he's dead.
[00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.469]  Okay.
[00:54:35.786 --> 00:54:43.952]  So, I guess you could say, well, we're just assuming that the FBI or the CIA or anybody has that ability to hack his car, but you know what?
[00:54:44.733 --> 00:54:48.556]  Do we have any evidence that can hold water, or is it really just kind of an intuition thing?
[00:54:48.836 --> 00:54:50.937]  Well, now we have the evidence that holds water.
[00:54:51.238 --> 00:54:52.979]  Are we going to get an investigation into this?
[00:54:53.279 --> 00:54:54.760]  Are we going to look into the CIA?
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.862]  How are we going to get any answers for Michael Hastings and his family?
[00:54:57.902 --> 00:54:59.363]  Now it goes one step further, Leigh-Anne.
[00:54:59.744 --> 00:55:01.325]  You just talked about the Russian stuff.
[00:55:01.525 --> 00:55:06.646]  Okay, so now via the Vault 7 leaks we find out that the CIA, of course we already knew this.
[00:55:06.846 --> 00:55:08.687]  Again, this is another no-duh factor.
[00:55:08.707 --> 00:55:13.828]  We've been saying that, hey, if Russia is going to hack anyone, they're going to leave the fingerprints of the Chinese.
[00:55:13.848 --> 00:55:15.549]  They're going to leave the fingerprints of somebody else.
[00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:16.789]  So this is typical.
[00:55:16.889 --> 00:55:20.250]  And people pointed out that if it truly was Russian hackers, they're
[00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:27.153]  It's so smart that the CIA is stealing their information to build up their own cyber arsenal.
[00:55:27.633 --> 00:55:30.955]  So why would the Russians be that stupid to leave a fingerprint?
[00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:34.216]  They wouldn't unless the CIA wanted to make a book.
[00:55:34.316 --> 00:55:39.479]  And now we know that that obvious thought process when you're a sophisticated hacker comes to mind.
[00:55:39.759 --> 00:55:43.060]  So we know that the CIA already had these plans.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.861]  They already had Umbridge ready to go.
[00:55:44.921 --> 00:55:45.882]  They already have these
[00:55:46.542 --> 00:55:51.268]  It's basically a false flag is you can go into a system, leave someone else's fingerprints.
[00:55:51.328 --> 00:55:54.973]  We've all seen it in the physical world, in the movies, you know, Jason Bourne, whatever have you.
[00:55:55.494 --> 00:56:01.942]  OK, so now we figure out, well, let's say that they decide they're going to announce that Trump
[00:56:03.257 --> 00:56:04.998]  Or somebody was hacked by the Russians.
[00:56:05.018 --> 00:56:06.879]  They're already claiming Russian hacking everywhere.
[00:56:06.899 --> 00:56:08.640]  Oh, but are we going to know?
[00:56:09.041 --> 00:56:11.042]  How am I going to know that it wasn't Umbridge?
[00:56:11.262 --> 00:56:13.844]  That it wasn't the CIA that left the Russian fingerprints?
[00:56:13.884 --> 00:56:15.505]  Now we know that they're talking about this.
[00:56:15.625 --> 00:56:21.869]  That's what Jerome Corsi says in his article, is that this is more so likely that the CIA actually created
[00:56:22.749 --> 00:56:31.595]  Counter espionage designed to implicate Trump and they could just do that and then bring that to To the Department of Justice and say look here's the evidence.
[00:56:31.975 --> 00:56:32.775]  We need a FISA.
[00:56:32.795 --> 00:56:33.356]  We need a green light.
[00:56:33.376 --> 00:56:35.237]  You know what's amazing to me about this Leanne?
[00:56:35.957 --> 00:56:38.679]  So this all breaks today this morning at about 9 a.m.
[00:56:38.719 --> 00:56:39.119]  Central.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.900]  I believe was the time it broke today.
[00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:45.223]  All of the media, I mean, you know that I'm pretty much just glued into the media 24-7.
[00:56:47.319 --> 00:56:48.899]  No one is talking about this.
[00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:49.339]  Right.
[00:56:49.479 --> 00:56:55.701]  The only place where you're going to find people talking about this right now, at least today, today, was on talk radio.
[00:56:56.101 --> 00:56:58.841]  You would not find this anywhere on the television news, folks.
[00:56:58.921 --> 00:57:00.022]  Trust me, I was watching.
[00:57:00.382 --> 00:57:07.823]  Nothing on Capitol Hill, nothing on CNN, nothing on Fox, nothing from Spicer's press conference today, nothing from anyone.
[00:57:08.343 --> 00:57:11.824]  And you would think that this would be the biggest story.
[00:57:12.344 --> 00:57:13.324]  Because guess what?
[00:57:13.745 --> 00:57:15.145]  As usual, on the Hill,
[00:57:15.985 --> 00:57:17.866]  In the Sean Spicer briefing?
[00:57:18.606 --> 00:57:19.406]  What are we talking about?
[00:57:19.526 --> 00:57:21.327]  Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:57:21.407 --> 00:57:22.307]  I've got Democrats.
[00:57:22.728 --> 00:57:26.949]  We're trying to get people confirmed to their job so that they can start working.
[00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:29.970]  I've got Democrats that get up on the podium.
[00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.351]  We're at a confirmation hearing here, okay?
[00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:34.052]  And they're spouting off about Russia.
[00:57:34.572 --> 00:57:35.933]  That's nothing to do with the hearing.
[00:57:36.093 --> 00:57:37.473]  They're spouting off about Russia.
[00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:42.735]  Nothing about Vault 7, and nothing about the fact that this could be a false flag to blame Russia.
[00:57:42.915 --> 00:57:44.455]  They just sit here and cry Russia all day.
[00:57:44.695 --> 00:57:48.577]  I'm just curious, are they going to even recognize the existence of this?
[00:57:48.977 --> 00:57:51.958]  I expect tonight on Fox News, Sean Hannity
[00:57:52.698 --> 00:57:54.640]  And Tucker Carlson will cover this.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.141]  But that's it.
[00:57:55.281 --> 00:57:56.102]  I bet no one else does.
[00:57:56.162 --> 00:58:12.857]  It's very interesting because Michael Hayden, who's out peddling his new book, this former CIA director, is actually talking about the amount of consistency, the amazing consistency, between the information that's disseminated by Russian media outlets and
[00:58:13.658 --> 00:58:19.861]  Conservative American sources like the Drudge Report, radio and TV host Sean Hannity, and Breitbart.
[00:58:20.142 --> 00:58:29.927]  So here we have Michael Hayden trying to implicate all of the pro-Trump media, us included, saying how we're all Russian agents, we're all putting out this Russian fake news.
[00:58:30.287 --> 00:58:37.011]  Meanwhile, Darren McBrain already broke the story last week about how they're creating fake websites to pump out their fake news.
[00:58:37.891 --> 00:58:38.972]  Still be in the dark, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:39.012 --> 00:58:39.413]  This is it.
[00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:40.854]  This is literally everything, folks.
[00:58:40.954 --> 00:58:42.216]  How can people not wake up?
[00:58:42.756 --> 00:58:44.058]  That's the biggest thing to me, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:44.318 --> 00:58:45.199]  How can people not wake up?
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:51.245]  I just think, imagine how President Trump feels now that he has access to all of that classified information.
[00:58:51.566 --> 00:58:52.226]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:52.347 --> 00:58:53.628]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:58:53.988 --> 00:58:55.890]  Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight.
[00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:57.832]  We'll see you here again tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[00:58:57.872 --> 00:58:58.133]  Central.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
