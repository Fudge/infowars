[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:17.396]  He never gives up.
[00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:19.397]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:22.098]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:23.258]  Worldwide.
[00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:56.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to get Paul Watson in here today to really co-host the first hour because he's such an expert on Brexit and what happened, obviously, with Le Pen and this landslide defeat at the hands of Emmanuel Macron, who is a literal Rothschild globalist frontman who literally poses for photos bowing down at the feet of Merkel.
[00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:01.645]  As Le Pen said last week, you'll either have me ruling you as a woman, or you'll have Merkel.
[00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:07.695]  This is all part of the cuckolding of the French, where it is a national religion now to bow down.
[00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.560]  Now a lot of the polls show Le Pen and a dead heat are winning.
[00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:12.734]  So maybe they weren't cuckold.
[00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:14.135]  Maybe the election was stolen.
[00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:16.577]  Paul discovered some evidence of fraud going on.
[00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:17.258]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:21.922]  I'll be popping in during this hour, and we'll also be here in the second and third hour.
[00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:23.643]  We have a bunch of big guests today.
[00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.725]  I'll tell you about the start of the next segment.
[00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:37.394]  We have huge news dealing with what's happening with Obamacare, a giant child porn bust, the largest ever with 150,000 people involved.
[00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.117]  That's all part of Trump giving the green light to roll up.
[00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:47.383]  The pedophile networks, and I have confirmed from our sources, the president has ordered an end to secretive geoengineering programs.
[00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:55.111]  I've noticed that myself, but I put some questions in and the word came back that yes, the president's aware of that, the programs are being reviewed.
[00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.113]  So a lot of huge news today.
[00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:02.498]  Speaking of breaking news, from inside the White House, Roger Stone is going to name names in the third hour.
[00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:04.003]  of course.
[00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:25.396]  I appreciate you coming in to mainly host the first hour today because of your expertise.
[00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.438]  Obviously, you've got family that lives in France.
[00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:28.378]  You live there part of the year.
[00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:33.764]  I guess you told me you're evacuating to another location in Europe because the Islamists have overrun things.
[00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:36.046]  We don't want to mention where that is, but wow.
[00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:37.788]  Paul, what's coming up today?
[00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.352]  Well Alex, I'm going to break down what happened with Macron.
[00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:52.960]  He entered to make his acceptance speech, and by the way there's a hilarious clip of him trying to read from a teleprompter and completely failing, which shows you the kind of presidency that it's going to be.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.541]  Total puppet!
[00:02:54.241 --> 00:03:03.686]  Yeah, there's video of him entering to make his acceptance speech and he walks out to the EU National Anthem before they even play the French National Anthem.
[00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:13.872]  He's walking out to the EU Anthem in front of a giant pyramid in the Louvre with a red blinking eye at the top of the pyramid right above his head.
[00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:18.834]  And I think they've actually got a GIF image of that that I sent that they can play to show you that.
[00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:22.096]  Macron giving his acceptance speech in front of the Louvre.
[00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:24.857]  Again, the giant pyramid symbolism behind him.
[00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:30.520]  And of course, the EU's got its own symbolism, Alex, just like the Stars and Stripes is a form of symbolism.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.361]  You know, the Pledge of Allegiance is a form of symbolism.
[00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:35.442]  Yeah, that's him reading out the teleprompter.
[00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:36.643]  That's the GIF right there.
[00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:38.904]  All hail the New World Order!
[00:03:39.424 --> 00:03:40.545]  Now, come on.
[00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:44.889]  We've got our own symbolism when it comes to nationalism and patriotism.
[00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.252]  That is globalist symbolism.
[00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:52.418]  By the way, Francois Mitterrand, this is mainstream news, was a Luciferian.
[00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:54.961]  He commissioned the 666 pieces of pink glass
[00:03:57.864 --> 00:04:04.247]  Pink orange glass for the pyramid, and he believed that it is the site of where now Lucifer resides.
[00:04:04.887 --> 00:04:11.530]  So that was Francois Mitterrand, the former French president, saying that the Louvre is the center of Satanism in the world.
[00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.312]  And of course they have it in movies when the aliens invade, in that Tom Cruise movie that came out a few years ago.
[00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:20.333]  But that's where the aliens have their mothership, is at the Louvre.
[00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.294]  I mean, talk about throwing it in our face, Paul.
[00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:28.162]  Well, this is a guy who said, quote, there's no such thing as French culture.
[00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:34.968]  The call to prayer in the Paris streets, they're now petitioning for that Islamic prayer to be made completely legal and acceptable.
[00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:38.611]  This is the future of France and we're going to talk about it after the break, Alex.
[00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.293]  All right, I'm going to come back and get a few of the other stories that are coming up and hand the baton to Paul for the rest of the hour.
[00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:44.494]  Really great to have Paul here.
[00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.276]  I'll also be back tomorrow hosting the fourth hour.
[00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:52.140]  Please tell everybody you know, listening on AM, FM, Internet, you name it, to tune in now.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.103]  They're trying to censor us and block us everywhere because we are so effective in the face of the globalists.
[00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.724]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:01.827]  Their New World Order is an anti-human, transhumanist movement.
[00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.291]  We're going to talk to Gerald Cilenti.
[00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:13.447]  The founder and editor of Trends Research Journal and also Trends Research Institute.
[00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:16.913]  So I want to talk to Gerald about how he sees
[00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:28.212]  Things going economically, but also the war and peace issues, because we're now seeing that Donald Trump talked to the UN National Security Council yesterday at the White House.
[00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:38.338]  He'll be meeting, I think it's today, with all 100 senators from within the White House, again, talking about the North Korean situation.
[00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:41.299]  And, Gerald, let's get your comments on that.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.583]  Optimistic about this working out peacefully, or do you think this is something that they're pushing for war?
[00:05:49.703 --> 00:05:52.725]  I've been hearing about North Korea just about all my life.
[00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:55.046]  I mean, this is a poor country.
[00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:57.307]  I mean, this is a country of nothing.
[00:05:58.021 --> 00:05:58.221]  Yeah.
[00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:03.144]  So, what this is, it's more war propaganda.
[00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:16.232]  It's what Eisenhower warned us of, that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:24.257]  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hope of its children.
[00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:35.003]  And when I listen to this guy that's in charge of the Defense Department, James, quote, Mad Dog Mattis, what adult would call himself Mad Dog?
[00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:38.168]  And I hear the words that they're speaking.
[00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:41.136]  In fact, it's a lot of fun to fight them, you know?
[00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:44.399]  It's a hell of a hoot.
[00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.460]  It's fun to shoot some people, I'll be right up on you.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.241]  I like brawling.
[00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:59.410]  And Gerald, we've just seen the Russians as well as the Chinese move massive amounts of military to the border that they have with North Korea because they're concerned about a massive flood of refugees.
[00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.631]  Coming into their country.
[00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:08.917]  If there is an economic meltdown from the sanctions or if there is a war, they know they can't absorb massive amounts of refugees.
[00:07:09.018 --> 00:07:10.199]  No country can.
[00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.620]  It isn't a racist thing.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.803]  It isn't that the Chinese are racist against the North Koreans or the Russians are racist against them.
[00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:16.864]  You simply can't do it.
[00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:18.245]  That's the way you destroy a country.
[00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:21.027]  So they have positioned their troops there at the border.
[00:07:21.047 --> 00:07:26.592]  Of course, we don't have troops to protect our borders because we're abroad fighting wars everywhere, aren't we?
[00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:30.775]  It's not racist if you don't want refugees.
[00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.397]  Go back to the Great Depression.
[00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:40.422]  I mentioned how bad this country is doing for we the little people who have to work for a living.
[00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.244]  When the Depression hit,
[00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:49.269]  They stopped everybody from coming in until the country rebuilt itself.
[00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:50.410]  We have 220, 320 million people.
[00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.731]  We can't take care of our own.
[00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.651]  I got a great idea.
[00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:54.313]  Let's bring in another 100 million.
[00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:13.885]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:31.972]  In front of a pyramid designed by Francois Mitterrand, the former president of France, with 666 pieces of pink glass dedicated to Lucifer,
[00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:43.151]  Mr. Macron, the new president who won by a landslide against the Nationalists, Marine Le Pen, walked out to the EU National Anthem.
[00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.812]  And there is the headline out of the Express News.
[00:08:46.472 --> 00:08:47.472]  I'll defend Europe!
[00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:53.974]  Macron snubs French National Anthem and walks out to EU song after win.
[00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:54.955]  Wow!
[00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:00.357]  Unbelievable!
[00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:08.419]  Imagine like having Hillary Clinton win the presidency and she walks out to a North American Union anthem.
[00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:11.280]  Dun-da-dun, dun-dun-dun.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.740]  Instead of the Star-Spangled Banner.
[00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:19.302]  Then they go on to the French anthem.
[00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:20.902]  I mean, talk about minions.
[00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:24.323]  This is truly incredible.
[00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.229]  Paul Watson lives in France part of the year.
[00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:28.170]  His family lives there.
[00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.231]  He's an expert on it.
[00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:35.735]  He's evacuating with his family because of the Islamic overrun of multi-million people.
[00:09:36.235 --> 00:09:39.537]  Paris is now a giant feces-covered cesspit.
[00:09:39.657 --> 00:09:41.518]  That's mainstream news.
[00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:44.280]  80% down in the last decade of their tourism.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.061]  But they don't care.
[00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.581]  They want to be cuckold.
[00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:53.446]  That's why we put the photo on screen for TV viewers of Macron kneeling and bowing at the feet of Merkel.
[00:09:55.458 --> 00:10:05.044]  So France capitulated to Hitler in less than two weeks in World War II because their high command stood down and became dictators over the country with their new capital in the south, Vichy France.
[00:10:05.624 --> 00:10:06.685]  And now they've done it again.
[00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:08.306]  But it isn't the German people.
[00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:09.827]  The Germans are paying for the EU.
[00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:13.509]  They're actually paying for the French pensions and the French welfare system.
[00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:17.752]  So Macron is attached to Germany like a giant lamprey.
[00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.346]  Truly insane.
[00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:22.127]  Coming up in the next hour, research.
[00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:25.029]  Unvaccinated children far healthier, have fewer disorders.
[00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.090]  Mainstream news.
[00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.451]  I got a stack of studies.
[00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:32.435]  I'm gonna tie it into the globalists trying to destabilize the West.
[00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:37.519]  Also, Florida man sentenced to 30 years for world's largest child porn website.
[00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:40.041]  Get this, it's called Playpen.
[00:10:40.662 --> 00:10:41.923]  Could it be sicker?
[00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:44.645]  How about hatching upside your head?
[00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:46.006]  Look at that demon.
[00:10:47.073 --> 00:10:50.854]  We're going to break that down as part of Trump's giant sweep rounding up the pedophiles everywhere.
[00:10:51.394 --> 00:10:52.214]  That's all coming up.
[00:10:52.614 --> 00:10:59.415]  Also, Rand Paul's discovering, and others are, that thousands of Americans were targeted by the NSA during the election for political purposes.
[00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:00.695]  He wants the details.
[00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:10.577]  We also have, insult to injury, unreal, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who calls you dumb idiots, says, thank God you're so stupid and have no memories.
[00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:15.198]  He blames Trump for rising premiums when Obamacare was designed to do that.
[00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:17.765]  And Obamacare is still in place.
[00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.526]  Unreal, he thinks you have no memory.
[00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:23.086]  He says, thank God you're so stupid.
[00:11:23.126 --> 00:11:25.227]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:29.068]  Let me tell you who we have joining us in the second hour.
[00:11:29.128 --> 00:11:38.350]  Jack Posobiec, Roger Stone with huge inside intel from the White House on exactly who the traitors are, how the shadow government deep-stakes blocking Trump.
[00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.990]  Leanne McAdoo, David Knight.
[00:11:41.877 --> 00:11:42.878]  And many others today.
[00:11:42.978 --> 00:11:46.980]  Paul Joseph Watson now takes over this hour.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.562]  And I will be back in the second hour with also this report.
[00:11:50.582 --> 00:11:53.203]  It's one of the most viral videos out there in the last two days.
[00:11:54.164 --> 00:11:55.245]  It was just posted on May 6.
[00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.626]  What humans will look like in a thousand years.
[00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.647]  They're telling you the reality of the world.
[00:12:00.067 --> 00:12:00.928]  Telling you what they're planning.
[00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:01.708]  Not a thousand.
[00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:05.410]  In a hundred years, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:09.953]  This is the system thrown in your face at idiotic level.
[00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.052]  I've been warning you about this in my film, Endgame, and so much more.
[00:12:14.092 --> 00:12:15.933]  This is the machine takeover of humanity.
[00:12:15.953 --> 00:12:18.335]  We're going to be breaking all this down.
[00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:26.280]  That's why they're getting rid of the genders right now, preparing you to not have a gender because you're going to be non-biological, as if you're even going to exist.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.424]  So we're going to break all this down, everything we told you they denied, down in your face, in the second hour.
[00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:36.827]  But now, Paul Joseph Watson, I know he was just in France a few days ago.
[00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:37.868]  Are you still in France, Paul?
[00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.159]  No, I'm in London now, Alex.
[00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:41.020]  You're back in London.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.760]  Okay, my friend.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.560]  Take over.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.581]  I want to ask you this question.
[00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:45.461]  Do you think it was election fraud?
[00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:47.822]  Because a lot of polls showed her neck and neck or her head.
[00:12:48.022 --> 00:12:59.006]  Or is this just French loving to go with trendiness, loving to go with the establishment, loving to go with the latest fashion, loving to go with the Rothschild banker, loving to go with groveling to the EU dictatorship?
[00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.286]  Was this them giving in to the propaganda?
[00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:04.727]  Or was this a massive fraud or a mix of both?
[00:13:05.008 --> 00:13:05.928]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:09.584]  Well, there's definitely questions about fraud, Alex.
[00:13:09.624 --> 00:13:16.285]  We had 500,000 French voters, expat voters, who would normally be expected to vote Macron.
[00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:18.886]  In fact, the vast majority did in this final run-off.
[00:13:19.306 --> 00:13:24.168]  Before the first round, being sent, again, 500,000 double ballots.
[00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:27.649]  So they could have voted twice, they're more likely to vote for Macron.
[00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:28.589]  That was a big problem.
[00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:32.210]  The police said, we're not going to investigate it until after the election, nobody cares.
[00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.851]  Then the other thing, we had a video up yesterday which showed, again,
[00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:42.374]  People receiving ballots, they received the ballot papers with the name of the candidate on them, and it was Macron-Macron.
[00:13:42.414 --> 00:13:43.754]  There wasn't Macron-Le Pen.
[00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:45.815]  So there were questions about fraud.
[00:13:46.175 --> 00:13:54.899]  So it could have happened, but I think in the greater scheme of things, as you said, this was about the cowardice of some, some of the French people.
[00:13:54.939 --> 00:14:02.022]  We have to remember that there were 25% of French people didn't even vote or spoiled their ballots.
[00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:05.064]  So this is by no means a huge mandate that Macron has.
[00:14:05.664 --> 00:14:27.300]  The other thing why people voted for Macron instead of Le Pen is because probably, mistakenly, Le Pen came out in her platform and said that she would immediately exit from the EU and revert back to the French franc, because of course France is currently on the euro system, which was probably not the brightest idea to announce that straight away.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:34.506]  Obviously to move towards it would be striking back against globalism, but the fact that that was in her platform put off
[00:14:35.046 --> 00:14:50.637]  A lot of the older voters in France, because their pensions are denominated in Euros, so they knew that if France switched back to the franc, the French franc, at least for a while, their savings, their pensions, would be devalued, at least in the short term.
[00:14:51.517 --> 00:15:13.225]  So it was kind of a somewhat selfish financial decision on their part and this is why Macron had the least support amongst 18 to 24 year olds who mainly supported Le Pen but he got the most support from over 65s which tells you that this whole image that's been manufactured around Macron's campaign this bright fresh young face
[00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:15.266]  Is complete BS.
[00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:23.530]  His supporters are over 65 in general when compared to Marine Le Pen, who has a youthful, energized, young movement behind her.
[00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.712]  In fact, I met several of them on Friday.
[00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.132]  So she's going to be back in 2022.
[00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:50.427]  The question is, will anything be left of France that's worth rescuing in 2022, given that they've had 21 jihadist attacks since Charlie Hebdo, given that they've had over 230 jihadist murders in that same time period, and of course six massive jihadist attacks in Paris alone in the last three years?
[00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:58.231]  But 90% of Parisians still voted for Emmanuel Macron, who again was sold on this lie.
[00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:00.432]  And I think this is why a lot of French people fell for it.
[00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:05.515]  French people have never had a Barack Obama or a Tony Blair.
[00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:25.128]  You know, a contrived fake populist that the media can package and sell as a, quote, maverick outsider, as they do with Macron, without digging an inch beneath the surface, which if anyone did, they would find out he was a bureaucrat in the outgoing socialist government, which got 6% of the vote, pathetically.
[00:16:25.608 --> 00:16:28.650]  He was a bureaucrat in the outgoing government for two years.
[00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.733]  He was a Bilderberg member, attended Bilderberg in Copenhagen in 2014.
[00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:35.915]  He was, of course, a Rothschild banker.
[00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:44.261]  He came from the very elitist school which the elite in France use to groom future leaders of their country.
[00:16:44.662 --> 00:16:57.131]  You can go down the line, every single establishment checkmark, Emmanuel Macron has got it, but because French people have never had this phenomenon where they are packaged and sold this fresh new face,
[00:16:58.032 --> 00:16:59.093]  A lot of them fell for it.
[00:16:59.153 --> 00:17:02.594]  Of course, now Americans are more wary to that post-Obama.
[00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:13.038]  British people even more so, post-Tony Blair, who turned out to be, who is now the most unpopular politician in Britain, yet he's still out there on the public stage.
[00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:14.539]  But France never had that.
[00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:17.260]  So a lot of them were cowardly, a lot of them fell for it.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.721]  They do have, again,
[00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.322]  Not all of them, not even the majority of them.
[00:17:21.402 --> 00:17:29.827]  So I'm not laying it on the French people, but there is this cowardice that's implicit within the mindset of the French, this fear of change.
[00:17:30.348 --> 00:17:40.494]  But in terms of old people, it was the fact that they were scared that their pensions would be devalued, and that's why many of them voted for Macron, who, by the way, has been greeted
[00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:45.280]  With riots out on the streets of Paris and France in major cities again today.
[00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:47.103]  Not by Le Pen voters.
[00:17:47.743 --> 00:17:53.089]  I was going to ask the question, you know, did you hear about all the Le Pen voters rioting across France last night?
[00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.072]  No, because it didn't happen.
[00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:59.917]  Because only leftists throw violent temper tantrums when they don't win an election.
[00:18:00.518 --> 00:18:12.243]  Yeah, Macron won and still these unionists, these left-wingers are out trashing the streets, starting fights with police officers on major streets, major cities in France today.
[00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:17.206]  So even the election of this fake populist has failed to quell that.
[00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:22.108]  In the very hours afterwards they were immediately out on the streets rioting.
[00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:32.214]  So if French people, Macron supporters, think they can stick their head in the sand, vote Macron, hold their nose and think this is all going to go away, it's not going to go away.
[00:18:32.594 --> 00:18:38.337]  This is a guy who said, quote, there is no such thing as French culture.
[00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:45.542]  This is now the guy leading France, a country once celebrated globally for its culture.
[00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:48.183]  Now says there is no French culture.
[00:18:48.684 --> 00:19:03.252]  Six months after a Muslim migrant mowed down, killed 84 people, injured hundreds more, including children in Nice, he came out six months later and said we should celebrate Muslim immigration.
[00:19:03.332 --> 00:19:06.174]  Anyone who is against it is basically a hateful coward.
[00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:14.190]  That's what he called 11 million Le Pen voters, who, by the way, are not far-right extremists.
[00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:22.335]  Most of them are poor farmers left behind, forgotten by globalism, forgotten by the very interests that Macron represents.
[00:19:22.836 --> 00:19:26.758]  Those are the people that he came out and called hateful cowards, 11 million of them.
[00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.202]  So that's what the situation is in France going forward.
[00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:40.487]  We've got a guy who literally hates the guts of 11 million people, a huge chunk of the population, who voted for Marine Le Pen.
[00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:42.428]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:19:42.508 --> 00:19:44.389]  And he's walking out to the EU anthem.
[00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:50.653]  He's basically hailing the new world order in front of a giant glass pyramid with a red flashing light above it.
[00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:52.233]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:19:52.614 --> 00:19:54.014]  We're going to get more into it after the break.
[00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:56.676]  This is the Alex Jones Show live with me, Paul Joseph Watson.

[00:20:53.297 --> 00:21:05.644]  France, specifically Paris, has been hit with six jihadist terror attacks in the last three years, yet just 5% of people in Paris voted for Marine Le Pen.
[00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.925]  38% voted for Macron.
[00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:12.588]  Are they happy just continuing to live with terrorism, you know, as Macron said before the vote?
[00:21:12.648 --> 00:21:14.950]  Are they just happy to continue with business as usual?
[00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:30.487]  It's insanity, and the worrying thing is, I hope the pen can do it this time, and I keep gauging that when it will happen is in four years' time, when we have the elections of Holland at the same time as Germany, now because of Theresa May, there'll be elections across Europe in four years' time.
[00:21:30.887 --> 00:21:35.230]  But the worrying thing is that the new generations, or the younger generations, think this is normal.
[00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.032]  Because as they're growing up in it, terrorism will become part of everyday life.
[00:21:39.872 --> 00:21:41.714]  Because that's all they've known and all they've seen.
[00:21:42.154 --> 00:21:45.916]  Because for the last four or five years, across Europe, it's just terror, terror, terror.
[00:21:45.996 --> 00:21:50.820]  For the next four years, I think when you look at the arrest rate, they go up 60% a year across Europe.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.383]  The attacks are intensifying, they're getting worse, they're getting bigger, they're getting badder.
[00:21:55.403 --> 00:22:00.106]  So it's worrying for the next... I think that the changing point will be the election in four years' time.
[00:22:00.526 --> 00:22:01.767]  But yeah, it's insanity.
[00:22:02.107 --> 00:22:02.888]  And for Paris,
[00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:08.895]  The feminists in France yesterday, they're not upset about this.
[00:22:08.955 --> 00:22:14.121]  They're not... Well, the women are in France, the ones who don't go out and expose themselves, the actual women voters.
[00:22:21.403 --> 00:22:28.125]  Majority voted for Marine Le Pen in France because of the threats they face, because they don't feel safe.
[00:22:28.245 --> 00:22:31.707]  They've done polls where they tell pollsters that they don't feel safe.
[00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:41.070]  She got the most votes from women, yet we have feminists out trying to block people from voting from Marine Le Pen, who would be the first female president of France.
[00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:50.761]  Anti-Le Pen protesters have come here to protest against the fact that the National Front is due to hold a rally in the venue just behind me.
[00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:56.027]  They were saying that they're unhappy with the National Front holding this rally here in Paris.
[00:22:56.067 --> 00:23:01.654]  They call them fascists and they say that they don't want them here and they're calling on people to rise up on the streets.
[00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:02.074]  I think?
[00:23:16.852 --> 00:23:19.133]  What is the fundamental disconnect?
[00:23:19.553 --> 00:23:28.376]  I mean, I guess it's just Islamism, feminism, the far left, they all have the general same goal of destabilizing society, overturning everything.
[00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:38.959]  So they've formed this toxic alliance, even though on the surface it's completely contradictory to the ideals of original feminism to protect women and women's rights.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.761]  It's like they use each other, because they see it as an ally who's getting their way.

[00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:12.700]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour tomorrow as well.
[00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:15.882]  Look at that image behind me, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:24:15.922 --> 00:24:17.604]  That is from French News Agency.
[00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:20.762]  You can probably fade it onto the screen in front of us.
[00:24:20.782 --> 00:24:21.722]  You can really see it clearly.
[00:24:22.062 --> 00:24:32.825]  A big, giant, black pyramid with an all-seeing eye right above his head, built by François Mitterrand, designed by the former French president in homage to Lucifer.
[00:24:33.325 --> 00:24:35.626]  That is mainstream news.
[00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:44.649]  Luciferianism in your face in Paris, where the Jacobins and Communism and all of the Illuminati systems come from.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.442]  There it is in your face, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:48.782 --> 00:24:51.324]  Back to Paul Joseph Watson in London, England.
[00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:53.326]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:54.607]  Yeah, we're going to go to a clip now.
[00:24:54.647 --> 00:25:07.638]  This is Nigel Farage and he's explaining why Marine Le Pen may need to ditch the National Front image to detoxify that whole brand and come back in five years' time with a better chance of winning the presidency.
[00:25:07.678 --> 00:25:08.619]  Here's Nigel Farage.
[00:25:09.597 --> 00:25:13.258]  Any surprise for you in the election of Macron?
[00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:20.040]  Is there any surprise in the defeat by 32 points of Marine Le Pen?
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.220]  No.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.081]  I think we knew that Macron was going to win.
[00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:31.343]  I don't think the French are yet ready for Frexit in the way that we were last year in our country.
[00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:37.364]  Maybe the one surprise is in the first round of this, 46.5% of voters
[00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:41.846]  I've never seen anything like that happen in a Western democracy.
[00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:04.377]  The reason I think is that the Front National has a bad history.
[00:26:04.977 --> 00:26:09.078]  Her father, you know, I'm afraid she's often judged by him.
[00:26:09.098 --> 00:26:13.700]  And I've been urging her now, personally, for five years.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.601]  And by the way, I've spoken to her campaign team tonight.
[00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:19.001]  She doesn't intend to give up.
[00:26:19.342 --> 00:26:28.985]  What she needs to do is to get rid of that National Front brand, to start again, and then all the people of left and right could get round her.
[00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:31.188]  In the second ballot next time round.
[00:26:31.208 --> 00:26:31.949]  And do you know something?
[00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:44.947]  I think what Macron will give is five more years of failure, five more years of uncontrolled immigration, five more years of failure with the euro, and I believe Le Pen, if she steadies herself, can win this in 2022.
[00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:49.268]  That is Nigel Farage's take on the French election.
[00:26:49.328 --> 00:26:51.370]  Related to that we have this story.
[00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.833]  France's National Front party to change name after election loss.
[00:26:55.434 --> 00:27:02.481]  And again, Western media, the English speaking media, always puts National Front because there was a party in the
[00:27:02.981 --> 00:27:11.548]  70s and 80s in Britain, now defunct for 30 years, that was actually a right-wing racist party called the National Front.
[00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:22.337]  It's called Front National in France, but they always flip it round because they want people to associate it with a party that's been defunct for 30 years to smear and demonise it.
[00:27:22.737 --> 00:27:30.243]  So France's far-right National Front party's gearing up for a name change, but not a makeover of its ideas after its decisive loss to centrists.
[00:27:30.804 --> 00:27:31.525]  Centrists!
[00:27:32.245 --> 00:27:36.350]  Far leftist socialist bureaucrat, that's who he really is, Emmanuel Macron.
[00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:46.644]  In interviews Monday, the campaign director for Marine Le Pen, David Rashline, said the party founded by her father would get a new name, as bait to pull in more supporters in France.
[00:27:46.724 --> 00:27:49.808]  So they're going to change the name, which is probably a good idea.
[00:27:50.649 --> 00:28:05.057]  Would also be a good idea to completely sabotage and prevent her father from having any kind of platform, because he also sticks his big mouth in everything, ruins it for everyone time and time again with his oafish comments.
[00:28:05.337 --> 00:28:06.638]  That needs to be clamped down on.
[00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:14.123]  But again, the question is, will there be anything worth rescuing in France in five years' time, given the situation that we've got right now?
[00:28:14.563 --> 00:28:15.944]  Hillary Clinton has come out.
[00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:22.646]  And praise Macron, headline Hillary Clinton ties herself to Macron's victory over Le Pen attacks the media.
[00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:32.090]  Clinton posted a tweet calling Macron's election a victory for the world and a defeat to the hackers who released Macron's emails to the public shortly before the election.
[00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:37.032]  Again, she still bought her over imaginary hackers.
[00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:39.693]  But then she turned the focus towards herself.
[00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:45.028]  Because she's an egomaniac, claiming, quote, the media says I can't talk about that.
[00:28:45.388 --> 00:28:49.531]  Clinton is known to have staffers carefully craft and edit her tweets before posting.
[00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:53.453]  She said it was victory for Macron for France, for the EU and the world.
[00:28:53.853 --> 00:28:56.175]  Defeat to those interfering with democracy.
[00:28:56.615 --> 00:28:59.037]  Oh, apart from if you're named Barack Obama.
[00:28:59.597 --> 00:29:03.000]  And then you can interfere with democracy on a regular basis.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:10.807]  You can come out before Brexit and order the British people to vote for Remain or they'd be at the back of the queue for a trade deal.
[00:29:11.427 --> 00:29:14.630]  Well, you're not overseeing that trade deal now, are you, Obama?
[00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.011]  And neither is Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:25.900]  But she literally tweeted, it was a victory, it was a defeat, sorry, for those interfering with democracy when Obama came out twice
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.501]  And interfered with this election by endorsing Macron.
[00:29:31.001 --> 00:29:35.822]  Most notably, of course, two days before the actual voting itself.
[00:29:35.922 --> 00:29:40.283]  Now Hillary Clinton is whining about hackers.
[00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:42.184]  Oh, the hackers were defeated again.
[00:29:42.204 --> 00:29:47.565]  She still can't move beyond that lame debunked narrative.
[00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:48.885]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:49.425]  We'll be back.
[00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:50.686]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:51.306]  Don't go away.
[00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:55.201]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.221 --> 00:29:58.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.044 --> 00:30:11.028]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and Liberals is sheerly maddening.
[00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:20.293]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention, the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage at the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:24.717]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.153]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:12.579]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.263]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:18.163 --> 00:31:20.385]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:21.606]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:26.189]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[00:31:26.249 --> 00:31:28.050]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:33.634]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:35.476]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:36.363 --> 00:31:46.487]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:47.448 --> 00:32:00.253]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:03.158 --> 00:32:10.924]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:11.144 --> 00:32:17.569]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.973]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[00:32:22.113 --> 00:32:31.957]  ...that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:35.098]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:35.358 --> 00:32:41.120]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:41.920]  It works.
[00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:50.546]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:32:50.666 --> 00:33:00.073]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:33:00.433 --> 00:33:00.913]  A total 360 win.
[00:33:05.504 --> 00:33:06.065]  News.
[00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:07.426]  Analysis.
[00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:08.627]  Reports.
[00:33:09.368 --> 00:33:18.677]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:18.737 --> 00:33:20.419]  Go back on the Alex Jones Show LIVE!
[00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.560]  Talking about Obama sticking his nose into everything.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.861]  You know, we were no fans of George W. Bush, but he managed to shut his mouth after he was out of office.
[00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:30.781]  That's not going to happen with Barack Obama.
[00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:42.244]  A couple of weeks ago, they were calling us conspiracy theorists for saying that Obama was interfering in the Trump administration after he'd literally set up a war room two miles from the White House to do exactly that.
[00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:45.965]  Oh, but you're a conspiracy theorist if you say Obama's interfering.
[00:33:46.505 --> 00:33:50.530]  Reuters reports Obama voices fervent hope Congress will tread carefully on healthcare.
[00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.315]  So he came out again last night, stuck his nose in again!
[00:33:54.335 --> 00:34:02.685]  I mean, that would be okay, but don't then claim that Obama is not interfering in anything, when he clearly is, on a regular basis.
[00:34:03.085 --> 00:34:04.106]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:34:05.106 --> 00:34:06.907]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:06.947 --> 00:34:11.350]  We need your support more than ever and DNA Force is about to sell out!

[00:34:22.598 --> 00:34:24.099]  Again, that was out of stock a while ago.
[00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.121]  Now it's back in for a short time only.
[00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:32.004]  It helps regenerate the body's natural intracellular antioxidants.

[00:34:42.304 --> 00:34:44.865]  I think we're trying to get more in stock.
[00:34:45.345 --> 00:34:49.806]  Don't know if that's happened yet, but it certainly was in short supply last time I checked.
[00:34:49.846 --> 00:35:04.130]  It is the high quality, made in America, premium t-shirt with the most triggering slogan you could ever imagine, along with my face, which makes it a hundred times more triggering
[00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.713]  Two verified liberals on Twitter and everybody else.
[00:35:09.454 --> 00:35:11.936]  The right kind of people that you really want to annoy.

[00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:50.641]  It all goes back into this war room to fight the mainstream media and their constant drumbeat of propaganda, smear, demonization campaigns against yours truly and against Alex Jones and against Infowars.com.

[00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:08.985]  We rely only on you getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:09.346 --> 00:36:11.247]  DNA Force about to sell out.

[00:36:12.388 --> 00:36:13.409]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:15.404 --> 00:36:19.526]  Now sticking with the French news just for a couple of minutes here, then we'll move on to other news.
[00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:36.637]  What we also saw last night after Macron's victory was Syrians, Syrian migrants at his rallies, at his celebration rallies in France, waving not the Syrian flag, waving the rebel jihadist flag.
[00:36:37.077 --> 00:36:52.509]  Now let me explain the difference between the Syrian national flag and the rebel jihadist flag because there are certain journalists on Twitter who don't know the difference yet try and lecture me and claim I'm lying and claim I'm fake news for pointing out the difference.
[00:36:52.549 --> 00:36:53.951]  In fact, let's throw up that tweet.
[00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.412]  I sent you the tweet before the show.
[00:36:55.932 --> 00:37:01.437]  We have a journalist called Richard Chambers tweeting after I drew attention to the fact that
[00:37:02.057 --> 00:37:03.939]  Macron supporters were celebrating.
[00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:04.619]  There's his tweet.
[00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:13.306]  Now if you go and click on my original tweet there, you can see, if you click on the original tweet right there, this is the image that I posted on Twitter earlier today.
[00:37:13.346 --> 00:37:17.089]  You can see that is the rebel FSA flag.
[00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:24.936]  That is the opposition jihadist sympathising group in Syria, the ones who defected to, the ones who gave all their weapons to ISIS.
[00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.357]  That is their flag.
[00:37:27.952 --> 00:37:31.254]  That is at a Macron rally in the immediate aftermath of the French election.
[00:37:31.274 --> 00:37:38.698]  Now you go back to his tweet, bearing in mind that this is not the Syrian national flag, this is the FSA rebel flag.
[00:37:39.158 --> 00:37:44.401]  You go back to the journalist's tweet, if you click back on the page there you can see what he said.
[00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:48.893]  He said this is, of course, the Syrian national flag.
[00:37:49.293 --> 00:37:50.534]  Liar's gonna lie!
[00:37:51.034 --> 00:37:54.757]  Well, Richard Chambers, it's not the Syrian national flag.
[00:37:54.797 --> 00:37:58.620]  If you scroll down, I actually explain what the difference is.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.302]  On the left you see the Syrian national flag.
[00:38:01.342 --> 00:38:05.165]  That is the flag of the Syrian government currently in control in Syria.
[00:38:05.505 --> 00:38:13.514]  The flag on the right is the FSA opposition rebel flag, not the official Syrian national flag.
[00:38:13.894 --> 00:38:18.840]  Even the United Nations on their own website says that it's not the Syrian national flag.
[00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:21.162]  So this guy is lying.
[00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:27.069]  He's literally putting out fake news while accusing me of lying and putting out fake news.
[00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:36.655]  Of course, this was retweeted by a bunch of verified liberals, as we call them on Twitter, you know, claiming they had the moral high ground.
[00:38:36.675 --> 00:38:37.096]  They're right.
[00:38:37.156 --> 00:38:46.684]  Oh my God, I've been caught red-handed putting out fake news by claiming that this flag, which is not the Syrian national flag, is not the Syrian national flag.
[00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:49.386]  I'm lying by telling the truth.
[00:38:50.687 --> 00:38:55.211]  I mean, they claimed that the Syrian national flag, that this was it.
[00:38:56.212 --> 00:39:03.280]  That this was the SNC flag, even though the SNC, the Syrian National Council, is not even based in Syria!
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.966]  It's based in Istanbul, and yet they're still claiming that this is the French national flag.
[00:39:09.066 --> 00:39:13.831]  And I point that out to him in the tweet, as did hundreds and hundreds of other people.
[00:39:14.292 --> 00:39:14.592]  But again...
[00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:16.626]  Is he going to delete the tweet?
[00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:18.147]  Is he going to issue a retraction?
[00:39:18.347 --> 00:39:18.547]  No.
[00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:22.209]  It's going to stay up there because these people are liars.
[00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:28.532]  They're putting out fake news while simultaneously accusing me of being a liar and putting out fake news.
[00:39:29.653 --> 00:39:32.395]  Well, you know, hundreds of people have probably retweeted that by now.
[00:39:32.796 --> 00:39:33.876]  They can snigger about it.
[00:39:33.936 --> 00:39:37.740]  Oh my God, I've been caught pointing out fake news when they're the ones literally doing that.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.242]  That is not the Syrian national flag.
[00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:43.724]  The Syrian national flag is red, white and black.
[00:39:43.784 --> 00:39:45.946]  It's not green, white and black, okay?
[00:39:46.246 --> 00:39:47.347]  That's the rebel flag.
[00:39:47.407 --> 00:39:53.032]  Those are the moderates, you know, the people that behead Christians and tear out hearts and eat them on camera.
[00:39:53.252 --> 00:39:54.753]  The moderates, yeah, those people.
[00:39:54.873 --> 00:39:55.634]  That's their flag.
[00:39:55.914 --> 00:39:57.215]  Not the Syrian national flag.
[00:39:57.275 --> 00:39:59.437]  Again, it's not the Syrian national flag.
[00:39:59.757 --> 00:40:01.458]  Yet this guy is not going to retract.
[00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:03.060]  He's just going to leave it up there.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:09.945]  Well, good luck to him because there are hundreds of people right now pointing out that he's the one putting out fake news.
[00:40:10.185 --> 00:40:15.169]  Absolutely incredible the lengths that they will go to to deny what's going on.
[00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.332]  Let's stick to some more France news before we move on now.
[00:40:19.672 --> 00:40:22.715]  One third of French voters spoil ballots or abstain.
[00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:23.735]  This is out of AFP.
[00:40:24.972 --> 00:40:29.103]  A third of French voters declined to choose between centrism and, again, centrist.
[00:40:30.885 --> 00:40:35.628]  You're not a centrist, you're literally a bureaucrat in the far-left socialist government.
[00:40:36.229 --> 00:40:41.532]  Declined to choose between Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is not even far-right in many issues.
[00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:47.336]  She's actually left-wing, especially economically, but, you know, we don't do nuance, do we, anymore, no.
[00:40:47.616 --> 00:40:48.797]  Far-right, demonize.
[00:40:48.977 --> 00:40:50.338]  Racist, fascist, demonize.
[00:40:50.358 --> 00:40:51.479]  We don't do nuance anymore.
[00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:56.482]  We don't point out actual facts or dig an inch below the surface, because that doesn't fit our narrative.
[00:40:57.503 --> 00:41:03.629]  So, a third either abstained or spoiled their ballots, which is a record rate in nearly half a century.
[00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:11.916]  According to official results, more than 80% of votes counted, the abstention rate stood at nearly 25%, the highest since 1969.
[00:41:12.176 --> 00:41:21.765]  In addition, they reported a record number of blank and invalid ballots, accounting for 9% of all registered voters, compared to 2% in the first round.
[00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:22.606]  So almost 10%
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:30.704]  Of all registered voters in France, spoiled their ballots or just submitted it blank.
[00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:36.347]  So you want to try and claim that this Macron globalist has a mandate.
[00:41:36.367 --> 00:41:38.408]  10% of people who voted spoiled their ballots.
[00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:45.072]  Obviously they don't have to be Le Pen supporters to be opposed to him and his agenda, which you see today.
[00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:46.814]  They're out on the streets again.
[00:41:47.394 --> 00:41:48.635]  Not Le Pen supporters.
[00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:56.499]  Unionists, left-wingers are out on the streets, major French cities, rioting, attacking cops, burning stuff.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:03.385]  As they did before the election, as they will continue to do so, because that is the new France.
[00:42:04.405 --> 00:42:10.370]  And the French people, at least enough of them, have voted for a continuation of that situation.
[00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:11.851]  Good luck.
[00:42:12.332 --> 00:42:13.092]  Good luck, France.
[00:42:13.152 --> 00:42:18.056]  I hope you're enjoying those 21 jihadist attacks in the past two and a half years.
[00:42:18.096 --> 00:42:18.737]  Good luck with that.
[00:42:20.057 --> 00:42:22.098]  Infowars.com story video.
[00:42:22.358 --> 00:42:25.579]  Italian reporter attacked by migrants on live television.
[00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:28.580]  You can go and watch the video in the article.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.441]  It's all in Italian, so I'll describe it.
[00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:36.803]  Shock video out of Italy shows a female reporter fleeing in panic after being attacked by migrants on live television.
[00:42:37.564 --> 00:42:43.206]  So she goes down to the local train station there in Rome to give a report on the situation.
[00:42:43.246 --> 00:42:48.408]  You see migrants sleeping on mattresses in the background, as you see in many French cities now.
[00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:51.429]  She was assaulted almost immediately.
[00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:54.491]  So you hear the feed cut for the live broadcast.
[00:42:54.652 --> 00:42:55.572]  She's assaulted.
[00:42:56.313 --> 00:42:58.134]  The people in the studio begin to panic.
[00:42:58.174 --> 00:42:59.195]  They say, call the police.
[00:42:59.215 --> 00:43:03.157]  She comes back briefly and says in Italian, we were attacked.
[00:43:03.237 --> 00:43:04.018]  We were attacked.
[00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:08.501]  Then this migrant tries to attack her and her cameraman again.
[00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.142]  She says, what do you want?
[00:43:10.182 --> 00:43:10.923]  Are you crazy?
[00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:15.579]  She lets out a loud scream and then the footage ends.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:21.164]  Oh my God, states the host of the show before again instructing his production teams to call the police.
[00:43:21.824 --> 00:43:32.313]  The migrant attempted to violently assault both Paris Ellen and her cameraman, but both were rescued by a passing taxi driver who bundled them to safety inside his car and called the police.
[00:43:33.649 --> 00:43:46.322]  They later identified the attacker as a 37-year-old from the Ivory Coast with no document or residency permit, who authorities had ordered deported back in September last year.
[00:43:47.984 --> 00:43:54.851]  Of course, he's still in the country, not deported, nothing whatsoever has happened to him, now he's free to attack and assault anyone else.
[00:43:55.973 --> 00:43:58.994]  Again, why are these migrants arriving in Italy?
[00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:12.681]  Because the EU and NGOs backed by big leftist conglomerates are literally providing a sea taxi service to go and pick up migrants 12 miles off the coast of Libya.
[00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:19.984]  They literally get into contact with criminal people smugglers who say we have a boatload of migrants ready.
[00:44:20.344 --> 00:44:20.785]  Many of them
[00:44:21.545 --> 00:44:22.526]  Not even from Libya.
[00:44:23.186 --> 00:44:26.329]  None of them from Syria, but most of them not even from Libya.
[00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:29.572]  They're from Eritrea, they're from Ivory Coast, they're from these other countries.
[00:44:30.372 --> 00:44:32.294]  None of which have a migrant crisis.
[00:44:32.814 --> 00:44:34.536]  None of which are being bombarded.
[00:44:35.296 --> 00:44:37.458]  None of whom these people are fleeing war.
[00:44:38.459 --> 00:44:41.240]  And almost none of whom are women and children.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:54.145]  But they get on the phone to the criminal people smugglers, they say, we've got another boatload, the EU, the NGOs literally sail all the way out to 12 miles off the coast of Libya, pick them up, dump them in Italy.
[00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:58.167]  Nowhere for them to go, so they just sleep under the train station.
[00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:03.589]  And then it leads to situations like this, where they're physically, violently attacking women.
[00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:06.130]  The process goes on and on and on.
[00:45:07.472 --> 00:45:14.600]  Gateway Pundit reports, horror in Germany woman breaks both legs after migrant hurls her out of a window for refusing sex.
[00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:23.249]  An asylum seeker in Germany is accused of throwing a woman out of a window and breaking both her legs, that's cultural enrichment, after she refused to have sex with him.
[00:45:24.949 --> 00:45:33.835]  Dawat A allegedly drank beer and vodka out of a refugee centre in Bensheim before threatening a woman identified only as Turhat 26 with a broken bottle.
[00:45:34.775 --> 00:45:39.539]  The prosecution said he was furious because he wanted to have sex and she refused him.
[00:45:40.119 --> 00:45:40.719]  Listen to this.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.324]  When I kept saying no, the victim said, he raised me up like a child, carried me to the window and dropped me.
[00:45:48.772 --> 00:45:53.635]  Dowett claimed he is being held for no reason and that life has been unfair.
[00:45:53.975 --> 00:45:55.176]  Oh, poor baby!
[00:45:55.736 --> 00:46:00.039]  Life has been so unfair that means you can go rape women and throw them out of windows.
[00:46:00.679 --> 00:46:01.519]  Uh, no it doesn't.
[00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:03.661]  Not in a civilised society, thank you very much.
[00:46:04.521 --> 00:46:06.862]  But life has been unfair since he came to Germany in 2014.
[00:46:06.942 --> 00:46:10.064]  He previously sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl!
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.420]  So it's not the first time it's happened again.
[00:46:14.961 --> 00:46:19.361]  You go and watch the videos, you go and talk to those migrants in Paris, in other French cities.
[00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:23.042]  They believe they should be given apartments, jobs, welfare for life.
[00:46:23.482 --> 00:46:28.363]  They find out that's not the reality that they've been told by the people smugglers.
[00:46:29.424 --> 00:46:33.984]  And they think they have a genuine grievance that allows them to go out and rape and kill women.
[00:46:34.004 --> 00:46:35.285]  Because that's reasonable.
[00:46:35.685 --> 00:46:36.825]  That's reasonable, isn't it?
[00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:38.725]  Life has been unfair.
[00:46:39.686 --> 00:46:40.746]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:46:41.325 --> 00:46:49.888]  And again, Macron said, celebrated the policy of importing Muslim migrants six months after the Nice attacks.
[00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:51.809]  It continues to get worse.
[00:46:51.869 --> 00:46:53.830]  We see these stories every single day.
[00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.131]  There's no end to it.
[00:46:55.471 --> 00:46:58.892]  With the summer months coming, it's only going to continue.
[00:47:00.092 --> 00:47:08.196]  Meanwhile, in America, shock video, elderly woman attacked block boys pool party in Florida, thrown into pool with her dogs.
[00:47:09.113 --> 00:47:25.405]  And this is quite interesting because more people were concerned about the dogs who were not thrown into the pool or assaulted, but an elderly white woman was slammed to the ground, then thrown into a pool along with her dogs on Saturday after she politely asked a mob of partygoers in South Florida to lower their music.
[00:47:26.306 --> 00:47:29.148]  Now you can go to the article and watch the video.
[00:47:29.328 --> 00:47:29.848]  Here it is.
[00:47:30.729 --> 00:47:32.430]  So he picks her up to throw her in the pool.
[00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.290]  Oh, but he slips.
[00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.071]  So they said, oh, that's OK.
[00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:40.413]  The guy who picked her up to assault her and throw her in the pool didn't mean to body slam her.
[00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:41.514]  He just slipped.
[00:47:42.354 --> 00:47:43.835]  Oh, that makes it OK then.
[00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:45.175]  No, that's fine.
[00:47:46.636 --> 00:47:49.317]  That was literally the response from people on Twitter.
[00:47:50.517 --> 00:47:54.939]  So when he slipped, she cracked her head on the concrete, concussed.
[00:47:55.719 --> 00:47:56.620]  She nearly drowned.
[00:47:58.496 --> 00:48:00.497]  Again, reverse the tables.
[00:48:00.717 --> 00:48:07.178]  If this was a group of white people assaulting an elderly black woman, it would be a national news story, and rightly so.
[00:48:07.738 --> 00:48:08.098]  This?
[00:48:09.259 --> 00:48:11.339]  Barely even a news story at all.
[00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:13.380]  They haven't caught the culprit.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.820]  It's obviously some kind of hate crime.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.041]  It's all over Twitter.
[00:48:17.301 --> 00:48:21.522]  When it was originally on Twitter, people were celebrating it and saying how funny it was.
[00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:24.525]  And then you had the excuses.
[00:48:24.645 --> 00:48:28.126]  Oh, he didn't mean to body slam her, he just slipped and cracked her head open.
[00:48:28.426 --> 00:48:29.246]  Oh, that's fine then.
[00:48:30.126 --> 00:48:33.087]  Before dumping her in the swimming pool, nearly drowning her.
[00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:34.627]  Oh, that's perfectly okay then again.
[00:48:35.588 --> 00:48:38.048]  Roles were reversed, it would be a national news story.
[00:48:38.088 --> 00:48:40.409]  It's barely even a news story.
[00:48:42.989 --> 00:48:46.650]  Information Liberation reports, soon the White Devils will be exterminated.
[00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.111]  DC ISIS sympathiser arrested buying AK-47 for race war.
[00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:54.004]  We've talked about this over and over again.
[00:48:54.784 --> 00:49:00.646]  We've seen it with the individual who shot the Dallas Cops, Xavier Johnson.
[00:49:00.726 --> 00:49:02.167]  Again, he wanted a race war.
[00:49:02.187 --> 00:49:03.267]  He hated white people.
[00:49:03.327 --> 00:49:12.871]  He was radicalized by this cutesy, trendy, anti-white racism that the dominant leftist media and cultural institutions have legitimized.
[00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:20.294]  It's creating actual, fringe, violent, radical people who are now actually sympathizing with ISIS.
[00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:22.255]  Talk about it over and over again.
[00:49:22.355 --> 00:49:28.920]  ISIS training manual, ISIS propaganda manual they put out saying the left shares most of our goals.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.982]  Why don't we just start recruiting them and turning them into violent jihadists?
[00:49:34.223 --> 00:49:35.844]  This is what's happened in this case.
[00:49:35.904 --> 00:49:47.913]  A Muslim black nationalist and ISIS sympathiser was busted by the FBI last week in Washington DC buying an AK-47 to allegedly attack white devils and start a race war.
[00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:52.355]  I wonder why the national media is ignoring this story.
[00:49:53.456 --> 00:49:59.999]  NBC Washington reports a DC resident who sympathized with ISIS bought an automatic weapon that he wanted to use to start a race war.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:06.843]  Clark Galloway was arrested Thursday after he arranged to buy an AK-47 from an FBI informant, court documents say.
[00:50:08.204 --> 00:50:11.987]  He posted on Facebook, soon the great killing will commence.
[00:50:13.072 --> 00:50:15.753]  And again he targeted white people.
[00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:18.814]  That was his motivation, his hatred for white people.
[00:50:19.654 --> 00:50:26.997]  He friended several hundred Islamic State fighters and sympathizers, joined ISIS Facebook groups and posted pro-ISIS propaganda.
[00:50:29.278 --> 00:50:32.659]  He had two Facebook accounts, one related to his extremist racial views.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.241]  Oh, he kept them separate, and one related to his pro-ISIS views.
[00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:40.803]  So this is a guy who was literally trying to be some pocket violent revolutionary.
[00:50:41.243 --> 00:50:45.945]  Again, you see that fusion between black militant groups and ISIS.
[00:50:47.466 --> 00:50:55.809]  Bearing in mind the ideological guru behind Black Lives Matter is a convicted cop killing terrorists, it all begins to make sense.
[00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:58.089]  We'll be back with the final segment of this hour.
[00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.450]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:04.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:07.092]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:14.554]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:51:14.754 --> 00:51:25.056]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:51:25.396 --> 00:51:32.999]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:43.204]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:51:43.444 --> 00:51:45.365]  And this part is most important.
[00:51:45.505 --> 00:51:51.968]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:51:52.308 --> 00:51:53.369]  That means it's clean.
[00:51:53.749 --> 00:51:54.730]  That means it's pure.
[00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.693]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:51:57.773 --> 00:52:00.375]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:02.197]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:09.263]  Anthropogenic globalists have won the French presidential election, with Macron becoming the youngest French president ever.
[00:52:09.323 --> 00:52:13.145]  Macron won in a landslide, thanks to many simply voting against Le Pen.
[00:52:13.325 --> 00:52:15.966]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election.
[00:52:16.186 --> 00:52:22.909]  Leaked documents revealed Macron would cater to Islam, Antifa, the EU, as well as his own personal offshore bank accounts.
[00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:25.151]  There will be no investigating into the U.S.
[00:52:25.231 --> 00:52:29.856]  meddling in the French election, despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S.
[00:52:29.916 --> 00:52:34.280]  news network endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:41.487]  The fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist, as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[00:52:41.607 --> 00:52:46.032]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive la France.
[00:52:46.312 --> 00:52:50.297]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate.
[00:52:50.457 --> 00:52:51.879]  They cheer hooray for France.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.001]  Long live France!
[00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:59.669]  As this election will likely mark the end of France and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.
[00:52:59.849 --> 00:53:02.312]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:11.939]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:53:11.999 --> 00:53:20.245]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:53:20.405 --> 00:53:25.088]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:53:25.288 --> 00:53:31.994]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:39.161]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:53:39.261 --> 00:53:46.128]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:53:46.288 --> 00:53:50.572]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:53:50.752 --> 00:53:53.993]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:53:54.133 --> 00:54:00.274]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:54:00.414 --> 00:54:02.115]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:54:02.135 --> 00:54:15.118]  From deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:54:16.038 --> 00:54:18.882]  With our London offices and the amazing Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:19.442 --> 00:54:21.124]  Follow him on Twitter, at Prison Planet.
[00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.127]  I'm at RealAlexJones.
[00:54:23.787 --> 00:54:27.993]  I'm getting more active on Twitter, not just pushing our stories and videos out, but a lot of my original thought.
[00:54:28.013 --> 00:54:32.158]  I'm gonna start getting on Periscope more, getting it loaded on my phone today, where I can, uh...
[00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:38.681]  Interact personally, without even having a camera person there, as much as possible.
[00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:41.003]  So be sure to follow me at RealAlexJones.
[00:54:41.644 --> 00:54:46.308]  We have gotten more of the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste with Iodine and Colloidal Silver back in.
[00:54:46.928 --> 00:54:49.670]  It's available, it's concentrated at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:54:50.031 --> 00:54:51.372]  Your purchase helps fund the operation.
[00:54:51.672 --> 00:54:56.756]  DNA Force is back in stock, but for the moment in time, it's going to sell out at current sales rates today.
[00:54:57.617 --> 00:54:59.738]  Your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[00:55:00.318 --> 00:55:03.679]  And we are also about to sell out of X2.
[00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:07.060]  And then Dr. Grubbs only got one more big run left.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.481]  And if he doesn't get more of the Deep Earth Crystals, that will be it for X2.
[00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:12.042]  I certainly hope that's not the case.
[00:55:12.382 --> 00:55:14.382]  But X2 is going to sell out the next 48 hours.
[00:55:14.743 --> 00:55:16.623]  It'll be about two weeks till we get more in.
[00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:20.164]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:55:20.224 --> 00:55:22.465]  We also have 40% off the new Micro Breeze Negative Ion.
[00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:26.487]  We're good to go.
[00:55:50.632 --> 00:55:53.615]  There is massive censorship taking place globally.
[00:55:54.295 --> 00:55:56.617]  InfoWars has been picked as the case point example.
[00:55:56.938 --> 00:55:59.260]  I want Paul to finish up the next four minutes with his points.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.466]  I want him to come back and do five more minutes with me at the start of the next hour on where he sees this battle the globalists are launching against free speech going.
[00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:08.008]  But Paul, back to the points you were making.
[00:56:09.861 --> 00:56:17.149]  Yeah, I don't know if you're aware of this, Alex, but of course we had the Homeland series recently, which was a direct attack on Info Wars.
[00:56:17.189 --> 00:56:22.575]  They literally created a character based around you, who by the way had a terrible accent and voice.
[00:56:22.636 --> 00:56:24.458]  It was a miserable failure.
[00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:33.004]  In fact, I think it's the lowest rated Homeland series ever, or it was for the first couple of episodes at least, because they had this big social justice turn.
[00:56:33.024 --> 00:56:34.285]  It actually used to be a good show.
[00:56:34.345 --> 00:56:35.826]  I used to watch it when it was actually good.
[00:56:36.146 --> 00:56:38.928]  Now they don't even have, like, Islamic terrorism.
[00:56:38.968 --> 00:56:39.889]  It's that PC.
[00:56:40.369 --> 00:56:52.979]  But this fake radio host who was based on you, the whole setup info was, they actually had a plotline where the traffic to his website was not real, and that it was all Russian bots.
[00:56:53.499 --> 00:56:54.680]  Faking traffic.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.763]  Not just tweets, but traffic to the actual website.
[00:56:59.164 --> 00:57:01.325]  Oh, and I guess Russia failed, didn't they, Paul?
[00:57:01.706 --> 00:57:02.506]  Russia failed.
[00:57:02.566 --> 00:57:04.648]  They were supposedly going to bring Le Pen in.
[00:57:04.848 --> 00:57:06.750]  The all-powerful Russians failed.
[00:57:08.186 --> 00:57:18.848]  Well, it's funny because this radio host character turns out to be working with the CIA as well, so they've literally taken everything they could think of, thrown it, and hoped that something would stick.
[00:57:18.908 --> 00:57:20.729]  It's a complete abysmal failure.
[00:57:20.749 --> 00:57:22.989]  Again, lowest ratings for any series.
[00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:29.170]  But again, you know, if we were all backed by Russian bots, who's buying the products, Alex?
[00:57:29.611 --> 00:57:31.031]  Are we sending them all to Russia?
[00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:36.373]  We have to have a real audience if we have people buying real physical products.
[00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:41.735]  Even the Washington Post last week had a headline, religion and guns, and said we're pro-gun because of Russians.
[00:57:42.175 --> 00:57:44.776]  Did you know it's Russia that gave us the Second Amendment, Paul?
[00:57:44.956 --> 00:57:49.938]  And as you see the USA Today, women now wearing hijabs in solidarity against Trump.
[00:57:50.178 --> 00:57:52.399]  The hijab is now the new symbol of feminism.
[00:57:53.936 --> 00:58:05.399]  The very first Arab feminist groups back in Egypt in 1922 literally said the hijab is a symbol of oppression, let's cast it off, let's get rid of it.
[00:58:05.739 --> 00:58:09.440]  They were Muslim Arab women a hundred years ago.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.521]  They were real feminists, okay?
[00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:16.702]  People wearing it now are not real feminists, they're in with the Islamist... No, that's a conspiracy theory, fake news!
[00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:22.485]  Cutting women's genitals off, keeping them as slaves, not letting them drive cars, executing them if another man rapes them.
[00:58:22.726 --> 00:58:25.607]  That is totally liberal and you're a hate-monger!
[00:58:25.908 --> 00:58:27.849]  Allah Allah Allah!
[00:58:28.089 --> 00:58:29.830]  You will be defeated infidel!
[00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:30.130]  No!
[00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:31.731]  It's genital mutilation.
[00:58:31.791 --> 00:58:33.012]  It's genital cutting.
[00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:34.473]  It's just like... Shut your mouth, pig!
[00:58:37.735 --> 00:58:39.498]  Shut your mouth, pig.
[00:58:39.738 --> 00:58:40.560]  We'll be back in 70.
[00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:42.242]  You will submit.
[00:58:43.604 --> 00:58:46.208]  All your women belong to me now.
[00:58:47.189 --> 00:58:48.491]  Allah will crush you.
[00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:52.437]  I love Markle.
[00:58:53.178 --> 00:58:57.383]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[00:59:55.495 --> 00:59:58.216]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.296 --> 01:00:01.037]  The infidel Watson will be defeated, ah yes.
[01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:09.810]  Yes, feminist.
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.011]  Wear hoods on head.
[01:00:11.771 --> 01:00:14.153]  Let us cut your genitals off.
[01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:16.134]  It's liberal!
[01:00:16.234 --> 01:00:17.695]  It's liberal!
[01:00:19.696 --> 01:00:24.719]  That's a fair time.
[01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:25.840]  Fairness doctrine.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.742]  I'm gonna have a character called Habib that pops in occasionally.
[01:00:28.762 --> 01:00:32.724]  We're going to blow you up in a slave caravan.
[01:00:32.764 --> 01:00:33.424]  You'll like it.
[01:00:33.484 --> 01:00:34.005]  It's liberal.
[01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:39.051]  It's not quite a Muslim accent, it's more like a weird Hungarian accent or something.
[01:00:41.153 --> 01:00:42.413]  Oh, mother!
[01:00:42.894 --> 01:00:44.174]  What are we gonna put up with here?
[01:00:44.195 --> 01:00:47.336]  Father!
[01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:49.498]  More of that fake voice.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.681]  It's all fake.
[01:00:55.681 --> 01:00:56.222]  Yeah, right.
[01:00:57.102 --> 01:00:59.023]  We're so real, they don't know what to do about it.
[01:00:59.764 --> 01:01:03.126]  We're total maniacs who don't care what the global stinkers say or do.
[01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:05.814]  All right, Watson!
[01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:10.336]  I'm fake, but Stephen Colbert is real.
[01:01:10.576 --> 01:01:15.299]  Paul, where do you see the censorship going, this total war that we're right in the middle of with our listeners?
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:24.845]  I mean, a lot of victories for nationalism, big defeat for nationalism and populism, with Le Pen just recapping the state of the world right now, Paul.
[01:01:26.471 --> 01:01:29.832]  Well, different European countries are at different points of the journey.
[01:01:29.892 --> 01:01:31.553]  Definitely France is further behind.
[01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:35.674]  Sweden Democrats are the most popular party in Sweden right now.
[01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.155]  They've got an election next year.
[01:01:37.575 --> 01:01:39.115]  We've got a German election coming up.
[01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:45.437]  That's probably a lost cause because the AFD is not very well organised, but generally because of just the mood in Germany.
[01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:48.358]  But again, that Swedish election next year is going to be big.
[01:01:48.678 --> 01:01:51.219]  And, you know, we continue to battle forward with Brexit.
[01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:52.560]  Talk about fake, Alex.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.821]  Zero Hedge has got a headline.
[01:01:55.521 --> 01:01:59.684]  Facebook deletes tens of thousands of accounts ahead of the UK general election.
[01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:09.269]  Now they did this before the French election, deleting 30,000 accounts right beforehand, and they say they're going to educate the public.
[01:02:09.569 --> 01:02:22.036]  They're taking out national newspaper print advertising campaign ads to, quote, educate the British public about fake news as part of a concerted global effort to crack down on the false information epidemic it's seen on its platform.
[01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:31.164]  And let's not forget, Posobiec being sued by the French because he quote, got involved in their election saying how horrible Macron is, while Obama got involved in the election.
[01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:34.748]  So every globalist can get involved, but none of us can have opinions, according to the French.
[01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:44.096]  No, and of course, the Stanford University study found that, quote, fake news had no effect whatsoever on the US presidential election.
[01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:46.057]  They never talk about that study, do they?
[01:02:46.337 --> 01:02:48.479]  Because again, the real agenda is censorship.
[01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:50.240]  Yes, there is fake news.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.481]  It's tiny!
[01:02:52.361 --> 01:02:58.305]  But then you look at the list of fake news websites, it's Breitbart, InfoWars, Daily Caller, it's all just conservative websites.
[01:02:58.325 --> 01:03:02.348]  Let's be clear, there are some fake news sites that hardly anybody goes to, they're like satire.
[01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:07.131]  So there's very few independent fake sites, but there are a ton of establishment ones.
[01:03:08.031 --> 01:03:13.755]  Major movie production companies, what, 20th Century Fox, or was it Universal, got caught putting out all those fake news sites to attack Trump.
[01:03:14.055 --> 01:03:17.417]  Comedy Central just put out a new fake video of Trump and people thought it was real.
[01:03:17.718 --> 01:03:20.800]  They're the ones constantly lying, saying WMDs are in Iraq.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.883]  I mean, they're the real corporate fake news, and that's at record levels, Paul.
[01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:37.930]  Well, literally, I talked about it earlier, this mainstream hack accused me of putting out fake news for saying that the rebel flag was being flown at Macron rallies.
[01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.651]  He claimed it was the Syrian national flag.
[01:03:40.971 --> 01:03:42.152]  Literally fake news.
[01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:43.713]  The Syrian national flag is red.
[01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:44.574]  We're good to go.
[01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:01.414]  And we see examples like that every day.
[01:04:01.654 --> 01:04:03.634]  So now Facebook is going to delete more accounts.
[01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:06.975]  They've got fake news flags so he can flag up fake news stories.
[01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:08.736]  Oh, but not if you go on CNN.
[01:04:09.016 --> 01:04:12.777]  Oh, and by the way, CNN's YouTube videos, none of them have been restricted.
[01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.317]  None have been demonetized.
[01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:18.038]  Even though they're talking about ISIS, they can put ISIS terrorism in the headline.
[01:04:18.279 --> 01:04:18.799]  We can't.
[01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:19.179]  That's right.
[01:04:19.199 --> 01:04:25.901]  We're not allowed to discuss and debate because we're not certified like CNN, like that internal Google memo saying CNN is real.
[01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:29.139]  And Ron Paul is not on Alex Jones.
[01:04:29.679 --> 01:04:33.981]  Because it said, you may notice we're reporting some of the same stuff, but when they do it, it's okay.
[01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:35.682]  When we do it, it's not allowed, Paul.
[01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:44.266]  And people on YouTube are now getting community strikes if they legitimately criticize and make fun of the Young Turks.
[01:04:44.346 --> 01:04:46.447]  They're getting videos wiped and communities wiped.
[01:04:46.487 --> 01:04:47.747]  Well, the Young Turks are in trouble.
[01:04:47.787 --> 01:04:54.270]  They're all, obviously their numbers are down, admittedly, and the new movie's come out, The Promise, showing what the Young Turks originally did in
[01:04:56.904 --> 01:04:58.491]  Situation in Turkey, so they're pretty upset.
[01:04:58.672 --> 01:04:59.455]  Paul, great job.
[01:04:59.475 --> 01:05:00.902]  See you back tomorrow in the fourth hour.
[01:05:01.203 --> 01:05:01.544]  We'll be back.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.902]  We've taken Brain Force and made it Brain Force Plus.
[01:05:06.122 --> 01:05:09.864]  Now at 20% more in the bottle and an even more hardcore formula.
[01:05:09.965 --> 01:05:12.346]  You owe it to yourself to get these products.
[01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:14.848]  They really have worked for myself, my family.
[01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:17.029]  They have five-star reviews by the thousands.
[01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:18.190]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:24.134]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.
[01:05:24.294 --> 01:05:29.458]  Introducing Caveman, where cutting-edge science meets ancient super nutrients.

[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:39.564]  The anthropogenic globalists have won the French presidential election, with Macron becoming the youngest French president ever.
[01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.487]  Macron won in a landslide, thanks to many simply voting against Le Pen.
[01:05:43.647 --> 01:05:46.288]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election.
[01:05:46.489 --> 01:05:53.233]  Leaked documents revealed Macron would cater to Islam, Antifa, the EU, as well as his own personal offshore bank accounts.
[01:05:53.393 --> 01:05:55.474]  There will be no investigating into the U.S.
[01:05:55.534 --> 01:06:00.175]  meddling in the French election, despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S.
[01:06:00.235 --> 01:06:04.596]  news network endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist.
[01:06:04.736 --> 01:06:11.818]  The fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist, as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[01:06:11.898 --> 01:06:16.339]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive la France.
[01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:20.740]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.180]  They cheer hooray for France.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.321]  Long live France!
[01:06:23.561 --> 01:06:29.982]  As this election will likely mark the end of France and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.
[01:06:30.142 --> 01:06:32.663]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:33.343 --> 01:06:41.105]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:41.325 --> 01:06:45.606]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing
[01:06:45.646 --> 01:06:46.527]  We're good to go!
[01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:11.343]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:07:11.643 --> 01:07:12.123]  It works.
[01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:20.710]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:30.258]  Defender Body Armor is now available through Infowarstore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.

[01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:16.809]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:08:17.369 --> 01:08:19.191]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.994 --> 01:08:27.077]  Look on screen if you are a TV viewer, radio listeners.
[01:08:27.117 --> 01:08:28.498]  Go to my Twitter, realalexjones.
[01:08:28.518 --> 01:08:29.038]  You can see it.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:37.285]  The globalist and their Luciferian system is now out in the open.
[01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:40.556]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.756 --> 01:08:57.547]  That's a direct screenshot from French news agency television with Macron standing in front of the 666 pieces of pink glass designed and commissioned by Francois Mitterrand, the former French president back in the early 1990s.
[01:08:58.087 --> 01:09:08.995]  And he wrote in major magazines that he channeled on a mountaintop the design of the pyramid to channel Lucifer and have Lucifer reside in Paris, France.
[01:09:12.475 --> 01:09:14.097]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:09:15.678 --> 01:09:18.040]  The Illuminati in your face.
[01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:22.665]  You might want to retweet that from Real Alex Jones and get it out to everybody you know.
[01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:31.393]  I want to get into opening the borders even more under globalism, their endgame.
[01:09:32.153 --> 01:09:34.015]  I want to get into the latest on Obamacare.
[01:09:34.856 --> 01:09:38.279]  Jack Posobiak sued by Mr.
[01:09:41.693 --> 01:09:45.334]  New World Order, Macron, is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:46.775 --> 01:09:51.136]  They're suing him for criticizing Macron and saying he worked for the Rothschilds in banking, which he did.
[01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:55.878]  Isn't that just special?
[01:09:55.918 --> 01:10:04.481]  This is the globalism that we're facing, where you get sued if you dare criticize any of their operations.
[01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.602]  Of course, it's a badge of honor to have such a thing happen to you.
[01:10:11.527 --> 01:10:13.849]  We all know what Mr. Soros is up to right now with me.
[01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:26.441]  So that's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:29.144 --> 01:10:34.109]  But let's look into what makes the globalists tick, what makes them operate.
[01:10:35.922 --> 01:10:40.525]  They want to condition the public to some new thing societally that's going to be happening.
[01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:48.190]  They'll tell them, oh, in 50 years, or 100 years, or 1,000 years, humans will split into two different species.
[01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:55.495]  Oh, in 100 years, there'll be a singularity, and we're going to transform into silicon-based life forms.
[01:10:55.535 --> 01:10:57.096]  But by then, you'll be dead.
[01:10:58.697 --> 01:11:03.320]  That way, you feel like you're not threatened, but you're being conditioned.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:04.421]  And Tech Insider,
[01:11:07.901 --> 01:11:22.828]  I guess a division of Business Insider has come out and explained how you're going to have nanotech inside you changing your DNA and how it's all going to be synthetic and how you're going to merge with machines and be immortal!
[01:11:24.158 --> 01:11:53.236]  Now, when I put out my film, Endgame, ten years ago, the New York Times attacked it and said it was totally delusional, and that I believe the elites were trying to be immortal, but first carry out the extermination of the general population of the planet, that they were going to play God and genetically re-engineer the entire world, and that they would introduce more chemicals and more biologicals to the vaccines and other systems, so that
[01:11:55.114 --> 01:12:05.578]  They could trigger genetic disorders that were predisposed when you're bombarded with certain chemicals or certain genetics or certain viruses to be triggered.
[01:12:05.978 --> 01:12:12.441]  Then as disease becomes epidemic on every front, they will then have treatments
[01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:21.736]  That allow you to live but change fundamentally who you are to survive and then make you a captive of that breakaway technology.
[01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:25.959]  They're saying within a generation 90% of births are going to be cesarean.
[01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.283]  They're already trying to phase out women breastfeeding their children.
[01:12:31.623 --> 01:12:35.246]  They knew a hundred years ago when they said go on formula, go to work women.
[01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:38.591]  Don't hold your baby next to your skin.
[01:12:38.932 --> 01:12:54.621]  They've already done psychological testing in England, the United States and Germany showing that children would have shrunken brains, low IQs and be basically sociopathic or zombie-like because they wouldn't have any real empathy or human connection.
[01:12:55.222 --> 01:12:56.943]  That's why you walk around in public
[01:12:57.827 --> 01:13:00.147]  And I don't care what color people are, they all look the same.
[01:13:00.187 --> 01:13:09.869]  Most of them look like shrunken head zombies with no life in their eyes, just wandering around aimlessly, shuffling, looking for somebody to give them something.
[01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:12.170]  They're the walking dead.
[01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:15.290]  I say let the dead bury the dead.
[01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:18.051]  I love them, I care about them, but you can't reach most of them.
[01:13:18.471 --> 01:13:23.532]  We've got to reach out to the people that still have the spark of energy in their eyes, who are still alive.
[01:13:24.452 --> 01:13:25.872]  Because the dead are all around us.
[01:13:26.889 --> 01:13:52.271]  And I realize that more people every day are succumbing to basically the sleep state, the near-consciousness state, and then once they're in that state, they're being programmed, they're being bombarded, they're being conditioned, they're being directed to basically hate themselves and hate everyone around them, so they can be prepared to just kind of roll over as husks, a form of humans, and die, falling to this alien system that's being built.
[01:13:53.527 --> 01:13:56.448]  When I say alien system, computers are alien to this planet.
[01:13:56.488 --> 01:13:59.630]  They're a new system, a new form of information.
[01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:01.431]  Are viruses alive or dead?
[01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:02.131]  You can argue that.
[01:14:02.591 --> 01:14:03.772]  Are computers alive or dead?
[01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:04.432]  You can argue that.
[01:14:05.993 --> 01:14:13.677]  Google is alive because billions of humans interface with it as a giant neural digital electrochemical network interface.
[01:14:14.777 --> 01:14:18.319]  And that's Google's own admission that they are building a over-the-horizon
[01:14:19.927 --> 01:14:47.772]  System that can tell the future and then manipulate human stimuli on a mass scale to control the future That's the big holy grail, but you can only do that by getting the general public to subserve To hand over their consciousness to hand over their will to the beast system And that's what they've now done They call themselves at the EU at the IMF at the World Bank at the WTO and
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.583]  At the TPP, all the same people, they call it... What do they call it?
[01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:00.107]  They call it a technocracy.
[01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:01.728]  What is a technocracy?
[01:15:02.088 --> 01:15:07.572]  A technological computerized system of total control run by an elite of technocrats.
[01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.495]  An all-seeing HAL 2000 computer.
[01:15:13.766 --> 01:15:26.574]  Mapping human development, human systems, and using that data to warp and destroy and sacrifice humanity on the altar of their synthetic silicon god.
[01:15:30.145 --> 01:15:31.485]  But they sell it like it's fun.
[01:15:31.886 --> 01:15:32.426]  It's cute.
[01:15:32.466 --> 01:15:37.327]  See, don't warn somebody that they're going to try to microchip the public to buy and sell 20 years ago.
[01:15:37.468 --> 01:15:38.088]  Oh, you're a kook.
[01:15:38.108 --> 01:15:38.748]  You're crazy.
[01:15:39.188 --> 01:15:43.870]  Even when it's in Pentagon documents, they don't want you to form the opinion that's dangerous up front.
[01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:45.390]  So they say, Alex Jones is crazy.
[01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.770]  He's evil.
[01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:46.070]  He's bad.
[01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:46.691]  It doesn't exist.
[01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.433]  Then it starts coming on ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:15:52.813 --> 01:15:54.333]  Soon everyone will have a chip.
[01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:55.574]  It's for the better good.
[01:15:55.614 --> 01:15:56.174]  Just submit.
[01:16:01.638 --> 01:16:03.439]  And then now, oh, world government is here.
[01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:06.279]  Oh, we are going to penalize you if you have more than one child.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.360]  Oh, most people are becoming sterile.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.441]  Don't worry, we have synthetic DNA.
[01:16:10.741 --> 01:16:15.482]  The government's going to let you have two daddies, because it's, you know, families are hurtful.
[01:16:15.722 --> 01:16:17.023]  Don't say you're a mother or a father.
[01:16:19.684 --> 01:16:25.105]  Don't say you're a mother or a father on your entrance paperwork for your kindergartner.
[01:16:25.385 --> 01:16:27.306]  Well, the next step is there are no sexes.
[01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:29.587]  They're getting rid
[01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:34.814]  Of that, because there will be no sexes.
[01:16:35.134 --> 01:16:37.258]  There's only people hooked into machines.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.683]  Into the big black pyramid of death.
[01:16:41.626 --> 01:16:42.448]  The technocracy.
[01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:57.472]  And so they come out, what humans look like in a thousand years, oh we'll be immortal, we'll be in machines, our consciousness will be in a machine, and I'm sure the people that let us do this, this big mainframe, it's going to be loving and let us have free will.
[01:16:57.672 --> 01:17:09.944]  Because the very people that are building it are all against free will, they're into pedophilia, they're into death, they're into war, they're into selfishness, they're into ego, they're into being total narcissists, while calling anybody that fights them a narcissist.
[01:17:10.484 --> 01:17:21.792]  But oh, I'm sure in the process of this, we'll all be taken up to the big mothership at childhood's end, and we'll all be happy in one big giant togetherness.
[01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:29.256]  But during this re-education, we've got to go live in big plastic sports stadiums, and there'll be no more money.
[01:17:29.276 --> 01:17:33.459]  It'll be the wonderful zeitgeist that the UN and the New York Times are pushing.
[01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:35.701]  Oh, it's going to be so wonderful.
[01:17:37.008 --> 01:17:41.373]  So we have the Plantopolis videos that are shown to elementary school students in England.
[01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:42.775]  There's 10 different videos.
[01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:45.578]  Guys, queue up Megaopolis or the Plantopolis.
[01:17:45.598 --> 01:17:46.219]  It's on YouTube.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:50.424]  And oh, you get meat once a year on your birthday and nobody has cars with the elite.
[01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.146]  And you're told what job you're going to have.
[01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:54.629]  And everything's tracked because of carbon being the big evil.
[01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.051]  Not genetic engineering.
[01:17:58.993 --> 01:18:02.396]  Not all the abominations against the planet and the genome and God.
[01:18:03.177 --> 01:18:03.917]  None of that's an issue.
[01:18:04.118 --> 01:18:05.639]  Not the human-animal chimeras.
[01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:06.760]  No, no, no, no.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.461]  None of that exists, even though it does exist.
[01:18:09.062 --> 01:18:11.504]  What really matters is carbon dioxide the plants breathe.
[01:18:11.524 --> 01:18:12.185]  Let's tax that.
[01:18:16.008 --> 01:18:25.897]  Because this is all about the fallen evil spirit on this planet, this interdimensional parasite wanting to be God, and so it needs to infect humanity, made in the image of God,
[01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:32.486]  Humanity that's meant to slowly, through free will, develop into our next level.
[01:18:33.787 --> 01:18:39.111]  We have this hijacker that's come in and taken over the species.
[01:18:40.472 --> 01:18:52.101]  And is using it, because he doesn't have the creativity, to build this new twisted system that it believes is its escape off this planet.
[01:18:55.233 --> 01:18:57.835]  Now the media, whenever I break that down, says I'm crazy, I'm nuts.
[01:18:57.855 --> 01:18:58.375]  What am I saying?
[01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.837]  They've built new silicon creations.
[01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:05.420]  They've built new animal-human hybrid clones.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.000]  That's admitted.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:14.646]  They've merged hundreds of different species together and put it in pharmacological crops and put it into salmon and put it into monkeys and put it into spider goats decades ago.
[01:19:20.117 --> 01:19:25.342]  And yes, China is planning a new megalopolis the size of New England to test new solutions.
[01:19:25.642 --> 01:19:37.573]  Kind of like the Pentagon admits that Disney World and Disneyland are psychological warfare testing facilities for the new planned cities where everyone's a prisoner with biometric ID codes.
[01:19:40.656 --> 01:19:45.500]  It's a dystopia because the people running it are dystopic.
[01:19:50.506 --> 01:19:52.986]  The economy's been turned on in China, not here.
[01:19:53.046 --> 01:19:55.047]  That's how they can build megacities in three years.
[01:19:56.907 --> 01:19:59.688]  We can't even pay off our debt because the elites don't want us to.
[01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:04.929]  Along comes Trump, saying he wants to do it, and they're fighting him like he's the devil incarnate.
[01:20:08.289 --> 01:20:13.410]  So now let me review the video that's gotten five and a half million views in two days.
[01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:15.971]  What humans will look like in a thousand years.
[01:20:17.216 --> 01:20:20.739]  What the elite want you to look like in 50 years if you're one of them.
[01:20:24.222 --> 01:20:28.726]  These hateful greedy people will keep hating and killing until there's only two of them left.
[01:20:29.146 --> 01:20:34.311]  And then they'll end up trying to kill each other for the great ultimate power of being the only conscious creature.
[01:20:34.551 --> 01:20:37.353]  As Ray Kurzweil said, he doesn't believe in God yet.
[01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:41.537]  So they have these TV
[01:20:45.970 --> 01:21:12.990]  Promotions out there, internet promotions, where, oh, it shows, oh, we're six, seven inches higher than we were a hundred years ago, and oh, you know, we had radio, we had TV, and then we had iPhones, and then, like a face sucker, it goes in your ear, it goes on your retina, it goes in your brain, and next you know it, you have turned into a cyborg, and the media will talk about how cool you are, and how amazing you are, and then you fully turn over whatever consciousness you have left into that false reality so that you can feel like you're a god.
[01:21:14.023 --> 01:21:16.252]  You won't be a god, you'll be living a delusion.
[01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:17.577]  A great delusion.
[01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:20.689]  The elites met in the last 30 years.
[01:21:20.929 --> 01:21:44.094]  They met 17 years ago, and Bill Joy, one of the owners of Sun Microsystems, said he met there, he talked with the elites, and the decision was give you low-level technology to entertain you to death, make you feel like you were transcendent, while the elite actually try to transcend, and then you'll finally just be exterminated once the robots and computers are all in place, and once you've been entertained into a jellyfish, Wall-E-like existence, so you can be pushed over more easily.
[01:21:45.418 --> 01:21:59.072]  You can also read why the future doesn't need us, but you can also read, revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim vision of the future, 2007, 10 years ago, where the British Ministry of Defense and the Pentagon basically said, the elites are going to move into compact.
[01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:00.738]  City-states.
[01:22:01.698 --> 01:22:04.080]  Everybody else is gonna have their resources turned off.
[01:22:04.301 --> 01:22:07.123]  The third world's gonna be allowed into what was left of the first world to crash it.
[01:22:07.483 --> 01:22:16.772]  Once the first world's been crashed, they'll then have the middle class get in agreement with a biological weapons release that'll wipe out most of the world population.
[01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:45.345]  But the injections you're given and the nanotech emulsions you're given, the drinks and blood transfusions you're given with nanotech to allow you to survive the biological apocalypse will enslave you completely as a binary weapon to the globalist system to be subservient and without paying everything into their system, giving them all your resources, submitting to them totally and completely, they will then not give you the new upgrades that are needed to be able to live into the future.
[01:22:45.845 --> 01:22:54.228]  And your journey towards absolute total enslavement will be complete once they insert you into the proto-matrix artificial environment that without it you'll die.
[01:22:54.448 --> 01:23:15.195]  Just like traveling to Mars you'd die without an artificial oxygen and gravity environment, you will die on this planet because the great goal is putting you into a system to end your humanity and make you totally subservient to them like ancient Chinese emperors and empresses in their forbidden city with three foot long toenails and their feet bound so they couldn't even walk
[01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:22.921]  With the ruling class behind the throne telling you from birth you are the supreme emperor, empress, you can't even wipe your own ass.
[01:23:24.462 --> 01:23:41.415]  But through trendiness and culture and it being fun and a grand falloon and a willingness to be giving up your own will to be part of something quote successful, you will waive all of your human rights never even knowing the system that you were basically put into from birth.
[01:23:42.654 --> 01:23:47.296]  But no one's more enslaved than the so-called elite themselves that believe they're part of this.
[01:23:47.657 --> 01:23:58.822]  That's why they have to bring down the borders, flood us with the third world populations, have feces on the streets, have heroin injectors everywhere, have society breaking down, child porn being force-fed to everybody.
[01:23:59.523 --> 01:24:02.764]  So that things are so ugly, you ask for virtual reality.
[01:24:03.525 --> 01:24:07.847]  The architecture is ugly, the culture is ugly, you ask to be in part of one of the farthest
[01:24:08.806 --> 01:24:17.540]  Or Equatorial Pacific Redoubts, where you can sit back and watch your technocrat parents direct the destruction of the world from their command base.
[01:24:20.745 --> 01:24:22.608]  Why would anyone want to put up with this?
[01:24:23.922 --> 01:24:44.305]  Because you look at the jellyfish-like followers, injected with brain-damaging chemicals from birth, fluoride, the vaccines, the GMO, shuffling around like zombies, looking for stimulus, looking for entertainment, not knowing real stimulus is about human endeavorment, and human empowerment, and the human future, and transcending this great evil, this marooned interdimensional attack.
[01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:53.413]  Because they're building a false synthetic chimera genetic engineering beyond the island of Dr. Maru.
[01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:53.934]  Nightmare!
[01:24:54.154 --> 01:24:55.875]  The alien species are already here.
[01:24:56.115 --> 01:24:57.716]  The alien attack is already here.
[01:24:57.917 --> 01:25:02.480]  The huge dust clouds flying around like interstellar.
[01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:06.643]  The atmosphere already breaking down.
[01:25:06.883 --> 01:25:08.044]  Holes in the atmosphere.
[01:25:09.721 --> 01:25:17.227]  From hundreds of nuclear tests by the United States to try to destroy the atmosphere, to try to destroy the Van Allen radiation belt, to try to blow holes in it.
[01:25:17.647 --> 01:25:18.388]  Blowing holes!
[01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:20.230]  The scientists just had to do it!
[01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:30.278]  They said it was religious to detonate huge hydrogen bombs, hundreds of them in the upper atmosphere, instead blowing holes in it, and off-gassing, and then geoengineering trying to destroy our atmosphere.
[01:25:35.009 --> 01:25:36.410]  We're up against major attack.
[01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:38.971]  This is a satanic invasion.
[01:25:39.451 --> 01:25:41.292]  You want to know what science fiction looks like, baby?
[01:25:41.552 --> 01:25:42.052]  You're in it!
[01:25:43.253 --> 01:25:45.434]  And you can already see most of the public's already fallen to it.
[01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:51.116]  And now they've got new nanotech in the food and the water, and nanotech in the water, and nanotech in the vaccines.
[01:25:51.376 --> 01:25:54.197]  But they need you to opt in, to go take it.
[01:25:54.397 --> 01:25:55.058]  It's metaphysical.
[01:25:55.902 --> 01:26:16.037]  And you take the vaccine, they've caught the last few major flu vaccines with nanotech in it, with artificially created viruses, the top virologists look at it and they say, we don't know what it is, because it's so compressed, but it's super advanced technology, and then it goes in and literally reprograms the brain, and then that's why people are now zombie-like, and they're only alive when they're watching TV being programmed.
[01:26:16.257 --> 01:26:17.959]  We're already in the mass collapse.
[01:26:23.493 --> 01:26:25.934]  Tens of thousands of pharmacological crops are planted everywhere.
[01:26:27.154 --> 01:26:29.735]  Growing viruses, growing live bacteria, growing chemicals.
[01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:32.195]  They're blowing around everywhere, just mixing with everything.
[01:26:32.356 --> 01:26:34.756]  They're using the plants as the weapon delivery system.
[01:26:40.758 --> 01:26:42.578]  And the globalists are testing it all on us.
[01:26:42.618 --> 01:26:46.740]  They've got mitigating sciences they've developed that they're testing on themselves.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:51.081]  And the only reason they haven't killed everybody yet is they still don't think they'd escape it
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:27:20.579]  They still aren't sure that they've got mitigating systems and they're worried about nuclear war because there's a few governments they don't completely control like Russia and others and Russia's got its own parallel plans along this direction and so they're all in a race for the singularity and they're afraid that if they let the cat out of the bag too soon and release the bioweapon that there'll be other governments like Pakistan and Russia and people they're gonna go so crazy during this they're gonna launch nuclear weapons and then that could damage their overall plan into the future.
[01:27:22.927 --> 01:27:33.755]  But you're already being murdered, you're already being killed, and so why do I even sit here and talk about, oh, the French president with a giant black pyramid behind him, built by a Luciferian?
[01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:38.518]  Why do we even talk about, of course there's giant child porn and child kidnapping operations going on.
[01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:44.182]  Of course, I mean, the very species is being slaughtered, being diseased, being attacked.
[01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:47.305]  The average Westerner has almost a 90% sperm count drop.
[01:27:47.685 --> 01:27:49.146]  Most women are now becoming infertile.
[01:27:52.543 --> 01:27:54.064]  It's all by design.
[01:27:55.024 --> 01:27:56.524]  Breast cancer up 3,000%.
[01:27:56.764 --> 01:27:57.705]  Pediatric cancer is over 10,000%.
[01:27:58.085 --> 01:28:00.546]  And it's all just normalized.
[01:28:00.586 --> 01:28:01.666]  It's all just no big deal.
[01:28:01.706 --> 01:28:03.127]  It's all just accept it.
[01:28:03.467 --> 01:28:04.387]  Just go along with it.
[01:28:04.427 --> 01:28:05.567]  Just give up your consciousness.
[01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.648]  Just be delusional.
[01:28:06.808 --> 01:28:07.988]  Just decide it's all okay.
[01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:08.969]  It's gonna be fun.
[01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:12.330]  Just like the elites say.
[01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:13.650]  Just let them have their future.
[01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:14.670]  Let them tell you it's fun.
[01:28:14.951 --> 01:28:16.991]  Let them tell you what humans will look like in a thousand years.
[01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:18.872]  Let's go ahead and play part of this viral video.
[01:28:20.598 --> 01:28:22.660]  What humans will look like in a thousand years.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.561]  Oh, listen, he's non-threatening.
[01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:24.943]  Humans are still evolving.
[01:28:25.343 --> 01:28:27.706]  So where will evolution take us in a thousand years?
[01:28:27.786 --> 01:28:28.086]  Hit pause.
[01:28:28.407 --> 01:28:28.647]  Back it up.
[01:28:29.348 --> 01:28:36.956]  Where will evolution, you can debate what type of evolution there is, you can debate what really happened on this planet, what seeded us here, you can go through all those debates.
[01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:40.078]  But this is telling you what will evolution look like.
[01:28:40.198 --> 01:28:41.338]  Oh, it's just evolution.
[01:28:41.658 --> 01:28:52.860]  No, the elite have taken control of our biological development, and they're a bunch of child-molesting devil-worshippers who've been promised by their God, if they destroy humanity, they'll be allowed to transcend.
[01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:55.941]  Sounds like a science fiction book.
[01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:59.141]  The alien spirit tells them, set this up, I'll tell you how to build it.
[01:28:59.662 --> 01:29:02.042]  You've already got the technology innate in your brain to build it.
[01:29:02.982 --> 01:29:05.983]  I'll direct you to build what I want, because I can't build it.
[01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:16.519]  Because all I do is destroy, all I do is twist, you build it, I'll direct exactly what I want, and then you kill everybody and then I'll let you blast off to space.
[01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.561]  They actually say that in this video.
[01:29:20.363 --> 01:29:22.705]  But again, oh, oh, oh.
[01:29:24.341 --> 01:29:26.483]  It's so cute, it's so sweet, it's so fun.
[01:29:26.503 --> 01:29:28.825]  It's a nice little nerdy, non-threatening voice.
[01:29:29.345 --> 01:29:31.447]  Oh, let's see where the evolution's going right now.
[01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:33.829]  No discussion that humans build their own environment.
[01:29:33.949 --> 01:29:35.450]  Humans have taken control of their own evolution.
[01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.831]  Just forget that big human secret.
[01:29:37.752 --> 01:29:38.673]  That we're master builders.
[01:29:39.914 --> 01:29:41.355]  Let the globalists be the architects.
[01:29:41.695 --> 01:29:43.076]  Let Lucifer be the grand architect.
[01:29:43.256 --> 01:29:44.237]  Let him direct it all.
[01:29:44.497 --> 01:29:45.898]  Just sit down and let him run things.
[01:29:46.259 --> 01:29:47.379]  He'll take real good care of you.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.383]  Just put these handcuffs on and come down in this dungeon and he'll love on you a little bit.
[01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:55.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.942 --> 01:29:58.650]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:07.475]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:07.515 --> 01:30:09.337]  We are under constant attack.
[01:30:09.897 --> 01:30:12.080]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.164]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[01:30:15.204 --> 01:30:23.013]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why
[01:30:23.573 --> 01:30:29.614]  We always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[01:30:30.214 --> 01:30:31.835]  They can't get to us that way.
[01:30:32.215 --> 01:30:35.035]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:36.036]  They don't have that power.
[01:30:36.516 --> 01:30:39.056]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[01:30:39.396 --> 01:30:41.797]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:30:42.237 --> 01:30:45.077]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:45.097 --> 01:30:46.738]  This is by listener request.
[01:30:46.978 --> 01:30:52.239]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[01:30:52.259 --> 01:30:52.819]  Again,
[01:30:53.559 --> 01:30:59.322]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[01:30:59.722 --> 01:31:04.023]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:08.285]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:13.229]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[01:31:13.249 --> 01:31:31.646]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:34.808]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[01:31:34.849 --> 01:31:36.870]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:39.232]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[01:31:39.673 --> 01:31:51.303]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[01:31:51.323 --> 01:31:54.405]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:10.132]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:32:10.292 --> 01:32:10.872]  I take this.
[01:32:11.132 --> 01:32:12.152]  My family takes this.
[01:32:12.252 --> 01:32:16.494]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:32:16.554 --> 01:32:20.795]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:32:21.155 --> 01:32:25.718]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:32:25.798 --> 01:32:26.838]  I don't feel good.
[01:32:26.918 --> 01:32:30.440]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.322]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:38.705]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:32:39.165 --> 01:32:41.586]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:32:42.127 --> 01:32:45.548]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:47.850]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:48.270]  I love it.
[01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:51.032]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.193]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:57.878]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:58.058 --> 01:32:59.820]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:00.820]  It's a win-win.
[01:33:01.301 --> 01:33:02.102]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:16.923 --> 01:33:21.029]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:33.188 --> 01:33:38.509]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, I'm going to finish up with my review of what humans will look like the next thousand years.
[01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:43.811]  It's kind of like saying, we'll tell you who you're going to marry and where you're going to go to school and what you're going to be and what you're going to think.
[01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:46.672]  We're going to tell you about what color your coffin's going to be.
[01:33:48.012 --> 01:33:48.812]  Let us run things.
[01:33:50.913 --> 01:33:56.394]  Now let's go back to the big black pyramid with the all-seeing eye designed by Luciferian Francois Mitterrand.
[01:33:56.414 --> 01:33:57.255]  That was in the newspapers.
[01:33:57.275 --> 01:33:58.395]  The French don't even hide it.
[01:33:59.645 --> 01:34:03.048]  At the Louvre with a big red eye glowing behind him.
[01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:06.071]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:34:08.953 --> 01:34:14.858]  And joining us is Jack Posobiec, who does a great job as a journalist online and as a researcher.
[01:34:15.299 --> 01:34:16.920]  CitizensforTrump.com.
[01:34:17.681 --> 01:34:18.722]  He's been sued!
[01:34:20.812 --> 01:34:23.793]  And when he first was getting sued last week, people were like, oh, more fake news.
[01:34:24.073 --> 01:34:25.693]  Well, actually, look at what Jack covers.
[01:34:25.733 --> 01:34:27.054]  It's all so incredibly accurate.
[01:34:27.274 --> 01:34:28.914]  That's why the fake news calls him the fake news.
[01:34:29.234 --> 01:34:30.815]  But now they admitted it days later.
[01:34:30.835 --> 01:34:34.156]  Macron files lawsuit over cyber misinformation.
[01:34:34.656 --> 01:34:40.217]  Paris prosecutors open probe into whether false news is being used to influence voting in the presidential election.
[01:34:40.538 --> 01:34:44.959]  And that's the word, as Germany and France and others are not going to sue Facebook and Google and Twitter.
[01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.479]  They're going to sue yours truly.
[01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:49.160]  They're going to sue Jack Posobiec.
[01:34:51.354 --> 01:34:52.774]  Isn't that just darling?
[01:34:52.834 --> 01:34:53.855]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:34:54.675 --> 01:34:56.516]  So he joins us to break this down.
[01:34:56.556 --> 01:34:58.196]  And of course, we all heard the Russians.
[01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:00.517]  We heard that Sobyak was a Russian agent.
[01:35:00.537 --> 01:35:02.658]  Remember a month or two ago they had congressional hearings.
[01:35:02.698 --> 01:35:08.599]  They said, and other people working for the Russians that were criminally investigating are Alex Jones.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.780]  He calls it InfoWar.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.120]  That's what the Russians call it too, sir.
[01:35:12.561 --> 01:35:15.021]  Yeah, information warfare's been around about 80 years, that term.
[01:35:15.922 --> 01:35:17.402]  So nobody bought the website in 1997.
[01:35:17.482 --> 01:35:18.622]  I thought, we're in InfoWar.
[01:35:18.983 --> 01:35:19.483]  It's the Globalist.
[01:35:19.523 --> 01:35:20.183]  I'll call it InfoWar.
[01:35:21.485 --> 01:35:31.253]  And of course, now we know that we're pro-gun because the Russians told us to be, and we're pro-life because the Russians told us to, and we're pro-free market, not because it's a better political system or economic system, but because the Russians taught us.
[01:35:32.034 --> 01:35:32.514]  That's right.
[01:35:33.635 --> 01:35:34.116]  That's right.
[01:35:35.237 --> 01:35:44.625]  Wow, I didn't know my granddaddy, working on the farm, my other grandfather, working for the, you know, as a leasehound for the oil companies, I didn't know my whole family worked and were free market folks because of the Russians.
[01:35:45.643 --> 01:35:48.705]  I didn't know my family fought the communists when they were running Russia.
[01:35:48.825 --> 01:35:50.307]  It just doesn't matter.
[01:35:50.347 --> 01:35:51.608]  We're all Russian agents now.
[01:35:52.208 --> 01:35:53.729]  Jack Posobiak joins us.
[01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:56.672]  He's a writer, filmmaker, recovering political operative.
[01:35:57.272 --> 01:36:01.095]  Jack was Special Projects Director for Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organization.
[01:36:01.495 --> 01:36:06.959]  Originally from Philadelphia area, Jack has worked for four presidential campaigns, as well as numerous candidates for Senate, Congress, and Governor.
[01:36:06.979 --> 01:36:08.080]  He's a veteran of the U.S.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.402]  Navy with multiple deployments overseas.
[01:36:10.422 --> 01:36:12.524]  He is fluent in Mandarin Chinese.
[01:36:14.039 --> 01:36:15.280]  Well, they don't call him a Chinese agent.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.782]  You know, Hillary and the Democrats are really on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[01:36:18.222 --> 01:36:19.443]  We're also on the Islamic payroll.
[01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:20.104]  Look at this.
[01:36:20.124 --> 01:36:22.666]  Hijab becomes symbol of resistance feminism in the age of Trump.
[01:36:23.206 --> 01:36:26.989]  So, Jack, I wonder if they're going to drop their lawsuit now.
[01:36:27.029 --> 01:36:29.631]  I guess you probably kind of want it to illustrate how they're anti-free speech.
[01:36:30.672 --> 01:36:32.013]  Other folks are getting sued around here.
[01:36:32.073 --> 01:36:32.954]  But, I mean, wow.
[01:36:33.474 --> 01:36:34.775]  What is all this signifying now?
[01:36:34.795 --> 01:36:36.477]  Of course, Le Pen going down in flames.
[01:36:37.722 --> 01:36:38.482]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:36:38.563 --> 01:36:46.927]  And, you know, we saw Macron come out not to the French national anthem, but he came out in front of that giant black pyramid with the red eye to the EU national anthem.
[01:36:47.247 --> 01:36:51.249]  And that pretty much says it all right there about this is the candidate that the elites brought up.
[01:36:51.589 --> 01:36:54.511]  The elites got him in there, actually worked for the Rothschild Bank.
[01:36:54.551 --> 01:36:56.712]  He's a direct Rothschild agent.
[01:36:57.052 --> 01:37:05.537]  And we're now pulling stuff out of the Macron leaks, which the French media, of course, told us not to look at, that the Macron Bank was actually funding cocktail parties
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:08.851]  Uh, at these glitzy spots for the Macron campaign.
[01:37:08.931 --> 01:37:12.112]  Not even sure if that's legal, but all this money is going directly into him.
[01:37:12.253 --> 01:37:16.434]  At 39 years old, we know that the guy, he's not really the one calling the shots there.
[01:37:16.494 --> 01:37:18.055]  He's just the guy on TV selling it to you.
[01:37:19.235 --> 01:37:21.156]  We're gonna play some of this audio.
[01:37:21.616 --> 01:37:22.377]  I'll defend Europe.
[01:37:22.417 --> 01:37:26.258]  Macron snubs French national anthem and walks out to EU song.
[01:37:26.578 --> 01:37:27.919]  We're gonna play some of that here in a moment.
[01:37:29.804 --> 01:37:30.905]  Why so arrogant?
[01:37:30.965 --> 01:37:41.171]  I guess just cucking everybody, breaking their will, throwing it in their face that he's a Rothschild agent, and then suing you because you dare point it all out.
[01:37:41.251 --> 01:37:45.714]  I mean, these people are so... And again, Francois Mitterrand admittedly helped design the Louvre.
[01:37:47.035 --> 01:37:50.899]  He was in the news saying it was a temple to Lucifer.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:52.401]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:53.683]  It just gets weirder and weirder.
[01:37:54.243 --> 01:37:59.369]  Him with a big black pyramid behind him at night with the EU anthem calling for world government.
[01:37:59.509 --> 01:38:00.511]  I mean, how do you make this up?
[01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:03.851]  That's exactly right, Alex, and it's a power play.
[01:38:03.871 --> 01:38:11.356]  You know, after losing in Brexit and after losing their candidate in Hillary in 2016 against Trump, now they're pushing out there.
[01:38:11.396 --> 01:38:20.922]  They have to show their hand a little bit more, but they're trying to remember to the rest of the world to remind them, hey, we're the masters, we're the ones in charge, and we're not going to go down without a fight.
[01:38:20.982 --> 01:38:22.663]  We still have so much power.
[01:38:22.903 --> 01:38:24.244]  We're still so strong here.
[01:38:24.364 --> 01:38:31.028]  France, Germany, which has their elections later this year, they're not going to let those go because those are the beating hearts of the EU.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.400]  It's crazy.
[01:38:34.941 --> 01:38:35.881]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:38.303]  Why do you think they're so arrogant?
[01:38:38.463 --> 01:38:40.184]  Just again, rubbing our faces in it?
[01:38:41.825 --> 01:38:44.566]  I think it's because they assume that the people are going to be cowards.
[01:38:44.786 --> 01:38:48.769]  I think they assume that people are not going to see this stuff to connect the dots and put it together.
[01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:51.991]  But that even if we do, that people won't do anything.
[01:38:52.031 --> 01:38:53.692]  That people won't organize.
[01:38:53.732 --> 01:38:56.093]  That people won't form their own political institutions.
[01:38:56.133 --> 01:38:59.555]  That people will simply read about it and then scroll on to the next thing.
[01:38:59.575 --> 01:39:02.977]  You know, you were just talking about how there's so much that goes on in our culture today.
[01:39:03.593 --> 01:39:07.719]  That's all about that sort of, you know, surface level instant gratification.
[01:39:07.739 --> 01:39:10.462]  Oh, we're just going to go watch the next Netflix video.
[01:39:10.482 --> 01:39:20.616]  We're going to go sit and watch, you know, what's on TV all day long like zombies rather than actually get involved in the political process and see what's going on to stop these people that are trying to take over our world.
[01:39:21.536 --> 01:39:24.437]  And by the way, I know the media will probably jump on my Luciferian comment.
[01:39:24.477 --> 01:39:26.278]  He's got a big black pyramid behind him.
[01:39:26.378 --> 01:39:30.899]  And Francois Mitterrand, I was on the air back in the mid-90s when he was retiring.
[01:39:30.919 --> 01:39:32.100]  I think he had cancer, was dying.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.942]  He was in the news saying, I came up with the idea of the pyramid and got it funded.
[01:39:37.302 --> 01:39:40.083]  666 pieces of pink glass dedicated to Lucifer.
[01:39:40.936 --> 01:39:44.959]  I mean, I challenged Mainstream News before they attacked me for that.
[01:39:45.319 --> 01:39:46.060]  Look that up!
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.321]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:39:48.762 --> 01:39:55.767]  And then now we see the polls where she was neck and neck or ahead or a little bit behind with the National Front.
[01:39:55.827 --> 01:39:58.088]  I guess they're changing the name, saying and having the word nation.
[01:39:58.448 --> 01:39:59.229]  It was being dirty.
[01:39:59.709 --> 01:40:01.330]  Do you think they stole the election from her?
[01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:06.194]  There was some evidence that went on, but I don't see stealing being able to give a landslide like this.
[01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:07.175]  Or was this just the French?
[01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:09.963]  Groveling to political correctness.
[01:40:10.163 --> 01:40:12.005]  We know the French love to be stylish.
[01:40:12.266 --> 01:40:13.427]  They love to be in the in crowd.
[01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:18.512]  Yeah, I think we have to remember that France, the electorate there, is not America.
[01:40:18.892 --> 01:40:20.794]  They don't have the history of America.
[01:40:20.835 --> 01:40:22.817]  They don't have the history of the American Revolution in 1776.
[01:40:24.434 --> 01:40:24.554]  Yes.
[01:40:39.537 --> 01:40:39.777]  I don't
[01:40:59.955 --> 01:41:03.919]  And that we should always be allowing these foreign invaders to come into our lands.
[01:41:04.279 --> 01:41:04.760]  That's right.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.725]  The Islamic Moor invaders out of North Africa and out of the Middle East went all the way up to the edge of France.
[01:41:11.426 --> 01:41:13.728]  They went all the way into the middle of Poland.
[01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:16.091]  They went all the way into the borders of Germany.
[01:41:16.111 --> 01:41:20.034]  And that's why Eastern Europe is the only place actually standing up to the Islamic invasion.
[01:41:20.535 --> 01:41:20.935]  Because they...
[01:41:21.856 --> 01:41:25.138]  You literally had their great-great-great-great-grandparents people slaughtered.
[01:41:25.719 --> 01:41:29.081]  But notice the Clintons backed, in the mid-90s, the attacks on Serbia.
[01:41:29.121 --> 01:41:35.966]  When the UN and the Muslims out of Albania launched the attacks, we gave one-third of Serbia to the Muslims.
[01:41:36.346 --> 01:41:41.850]  So this has been an ongoing theme in the non-radical Muslims in Syria, in Egypt, in Libya.
[01:41:42.190 --> 01:41:44.772]  They get overthrown, radical Muslims get put in.
[01:41:45.113 --> 01:41:50.437]  No one can deny now that David Horowitz, who envisioned this 16, 17 years ago, has been proven right.
[01:41:50.517 --> 01:42:07.612]  Now it's admitted, but looking at 2017, Merkel with Macron bowing down to her in this bizarre photo, promising to bring in more Muslims, arresting people that criticize Islam, indicting Le Pen for criticizing Islam, this is insane national suicide
[01:42:08.132 --> 01:42:12.435]  And the Muslims just run around murdering and driving over people and shooting and stabbing people.
[01:42:12.935 --> 01:42:15.377]  Why are they doing that when Europe's capitulating to them?
[01:42:15.397 --> 01:42:20.320]  I mean, where do you see all this going and how is the EU's plan to Islamify Europe going?
[01:42:22.165 --> 01:42:23.767]  It's going without a hitch at this point.
[01:42:23.807 --> 01:42:31.096]  I mean, I suppose Brexit was probably their first stumbling block, but now they're pushing back so at least the continent of Europe will continue to be Islamified.
[01:42:31.637 --> 01:42:34.720]  What they essentially want, Alex, is that they want these attacks.
[01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:36.182]  They want this violence.
[01:42:36.222 --> 01:42:39.106]  They want this going on in the streets, and they're going to continue to use that.
[01:42:39.454 --> 01:42:39.674]  Yeah.
[01:42:56.721 --> 01:43:01.564]  And to multinational corporations that can now get into those countries that they haven't had access to in the past.
[01:43:01.864 --> 01:43:03.125]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[01:43:03.165 --> 01:43:04.466]  That's in the PNAC documents.
[01:43:04.886 --> 01:43:07.067]  By the Republicans, the Democrats have their own documents.
[01:43:07.668 --> 01:43:14.012]  We've got Wesley Clark, who was part of the whole takeover in Serbia, admitting that was a plan, saying he thought it was bad ten years ago.
[01:43:14.072 --> 01:43:16.773]  And two different speeches he gave describing the battle plan.
[01:43:17.174 --> 01:43:21.997]  Let's explain third dimensional, full spectrum dominance, Hegelian dialectic to folks that don't understand it.
[01:43:22.637 --> 01:43:33.563]  You go in, you put radical Muslims in, you back Saudi Arabia funding it, then you let them create their own terrorists that are real terrorists that attack you, then you use that to say, oh, we can't criticize Islam.
[01:43:33.803 --> 01:43:35.064]  We've got to have sensitivity training.
[01:43:35.304 --> 01:43:36.544]  You're causing them to attack.
[01:43:36.785 --> 01:43:41.047]  Here, let's have the cuckold Stockholm Syndrome, literally, in Stockholm, Sweden, women.
[01:43:41.827 --> 01:43:58.425]  I began five years ago wearing hijabs in solidarity, saying, please don't rape me, please don't kill me, I'll submit to your bullying, please don't beat up our newspaper reporters, don't beat up our TV reporters, like we just saw in Rome last night, them beating the woman up, the Islamicist, because she dare go videotape them on a city street.
[01:43:58.925 --> 01:44:16.543]  You know, this is the whole attitude, and so they get to take over, put radical Islam in, have an excuse to blow up some of these countries, who the Islamists are actually about to invade, but blame it on some random country like Iraq or Syria, then use those attacks to take our liberties here domestically, all the time accelerating the Islamification.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.261]  I'm not looking very much closely at Eastern Europe, as you mentioned, and slob right there, what they're doing.
[01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:28.842]  They've actually, especially Poland, has refused to take a single Islamic migrant.
[01:44:28.922 --> 01:44:37.264]  And the Prime Minister of Poland, Beate Szydlo, she came out specifically and said, these migrants are linked with terrorism and we will not accept a single one.
[01:44:37.524 --> 01:44:43.006]  The EU has pushed back and said, you have to accept that thousands and thousands of these migrants...
[01:44:44.557 --> 01:44:44.697]  Right.
[01:44:44.717 --> 01:44:45.518]  Are they going to fine you?
[01:44:45.538 --> 01:44:47.939]  They're going to cut off financial aid?
[01:44:47.959 --> 01:44:49.760]  They're going to cut off the ability of them to travel?
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:45:00.187]  So it's very interesting to see how Eastern Europe and Slav right is going to respond to this and will we see an unraveling of the EU with the East siding potentially more with Russia?
[01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:03.249]  Well, you notice the Slavs in Serbia and in Poland.
[01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:13.772]  And in Romania, and in Hungary, and in Russia, are the only people willing to stand up because they were constantly attacked the last 1400 years, continually by Muslims.
[01:45:13.792 --> 01:45:14.792]  They're like, are you kidding?
[01:45:15.252 --> 01:45:21.454]  And then 80% of them show up, according to even Interpol, and they're military-age men on Facebook celebrating what they did in Syria.
[01:45:21.714 --> 01:45:23.234]  They just got their butts kicked out.
[01:45:23.634 --> 01:45:29.716]  Syria was the new homeland of the Islamic invasion of the world, the spearhead into Turkey that's now shifted to caliphate.
[01:45:30.336 --> 01:45:31.297]  Oh, we're non-radical.
[01:45:31.357 --> 01:45:33.079]  Let Europe build highways to us.
[01:45:33.359 --> 01:45:39.586]  As soon as they got their people in, enough Turks in, now they've announced, we're gonna have jihad.
[01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.427]  Submit to us.
[01:45:40.727 --> 01:45:41.988]  Merkel says, we will submit.
[01:45:42.248 --> 01:45:46.233]  So the EU is literally merging with Islam, opening the gates of Europe.
[01:45:47.219 --> 01:45:54.864]  Having them spill in for a check made against the West, full-spectrum dominance, this is absolutely on record now.
[01:45:54.924 --> 01:45:55.425]  It's incredible.
[01:45:56.005 --> 01:46:01.288]  And again, Jack Posobiec, you're so calmly taking it that I noticed the psychological warfare here.
[01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:06.632]  First you say, I've been sued by France, by the now President of France, when he was a candidate.
[01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:10.395]  They go, oh shut up Posobiec, oh sure, right.
[01:46:10.415 --> 01:46:11.876]  Because they always do that.
[01:46:11.996 --> 01:46:14.798]  Then they come out and go, okay fine, you have been sued, you deserve to be shut down.
[01:46:15.578 --> 01:46:18.719]  So, now here you are being sued by the President of France.
[01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.799]  To me this shows how weak they are.
[01:46:21.259 --> 01:46:22.019]  They're the traitors.
[01:46:22.059 --> 01:46:23.199]  They're selling everybody out.
[01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:24.240]  They're the scum of the earth.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.620]  They're standing in front of giant black pyramids saying submit to them.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.441]  I mean, so this is such a badge of honor.
[01:46:30.481 --> 01:46:32.661]  I'm so envious that you've been sued by the President.
[01:46:32.701 --> 01:46:34.501]  I've only been sued by Jordan Soros' people.
[01:46:35.182 --> 01:46:36.462]  You'll get there one day, Alex.
[01:46:36.522 --> 01:46:36.962]  Don't worry.
[01:46:39.362 --> 01:46:42.663]  So where does this, how did you learn about the suit and where's all this going?
[01:46:43.595 --> 01:46:51.438]  Well, we heard about it when it was released to the media by French authorities, as well as Macron.
[01:46:51.818 --> 01:47:02.022]  We heard about it from our legal side, and the rebel media's legal team is going to be pushing back against this and is absolutely saying that, you know, we're completely defended by the First Amendment here, and there isn't anything we've done.
[01:47:02.462 --> 01:47:03.402]  We're not hackers.
[01:47:03.482 --> 01:47:05.063]  We're not Russian agents.
[01:47:05.243 --> 01:47:09.245]  You're journalists, and you're absolutely kicking butt, so they hate you.
[01:47:09.985 --> 01:47:10.145]  Right.
[01:47:11.693 --> 01:47:21.099]  It's funny because the French in the Fourth Estate back in the days of the French Revolution, you know, when I was in journalism school we studied that as something to be revered.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:27.804]  It was journalism, French journalism, hundreds of years ago that spoke truth to power and I thought that that was the point of real journalism.
[01:47:28.064 --> 01:47:34.629]  Well it turns out that now the French journalists are the ones that are in power and they're using that power to strike down anyone who speaks truth.
[01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:36.491]  And notice how they turn this around.
[01:47:36.651 --> 01:47:38.132]  They meet with China the last few years.
[01:47:38.192 --> 01:47:39.193]  Zuckerberg meets with them.
[01:47:39.213 --> 01:47:40.034]  Google meets with them.
[01:47:40.394 --> 01:47:41.435]  Twitter meets with them.
[01:47:41.495 --> 01:47:44.558]  China says, censor America and Europe better and we'll let you in.
[01:47:44.978 --> 01:47:45.699]  But prove you can do it.
[01:47:45.719 --> 01:47:46.920]  And here we're going to advise you.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.983]  Then Microsoft comes out with new operating systems to help China censor.
[01:47:51.443 --> 01:47:52.564]  And they go, you've been good.
[01:47:52.624 --> 01:47:53.385]  We'll let you in.
[01:47:53.525 --> 01:47:53.805]  Good.
[01:47:53.825 --> 01:47:54.786]  You know, good doggie.
[01:47:55.687 --> 01:47:57.648]  And so now all this is happening.
[01:47:58.349 --> 01:48:01.171]  And so the French government, the EU government comes out.
[01:48:01.672 --> 01:48:03.874]  The German government fires former Stasi.
[01:48:04.963 --> 01:48:17.606]  To help start tagging people to be arrested that criticize Islam, and then the government of France comes after you for telling the truth, but, oh, it's because you're fake news, even though what you said is true.
[01:48:17.626 --> 01:48:18.487]  They don't dispute that.
[01:48:18.827 --> 01:48:27.269]  And then they're the good guys, the little old government, coming after you, the giant, evil, dirty, horrible, Russian-backed journalist, when none of it's even true.
[01:48:27.529 --> 01:48:31.250]  I mean, people, this is outrageous that they're trying to get away with this, Jack.
[01:48:32.557 --> 01:48:33.298]  You're absolutely right.
[01:48:33.698 --> 01:48:37.282]  And, you know, it reminds me of talking about the French Revolution.
[01:48:37.362 --> 01:48:38.604]  Robespierre back in the day.
[01:48:38.684 --> 01:48:40.566]  Robespierre, the reign of terror in France.
[01:48:40.626 --> 01:48:43.409]  It seems that Robespierre probably would have voted for Macron.
[01:48:43.469 --> 01:48:47.393]  Robespierre would have been one of those people who was in league with these elites.
[01:48:47.994 --> 01:48:54.161]  And then now the elites, instead of it just being the elite of France or the elite of Europe, it's spread to places like China, places like
[01:48:54.965 --> 01:49:02.990]  Uh, places like parts of Africa and the Middle East where they're getting their, their toehold in and they're going to be expanding it further and further because they have the power of the internet as well.
[01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:05.712]  But what they didn't realize is the double-edged sword of it.
[01:49:05.952 --> 01:49:14.558]  And so that outlets like InfoWars and like Rebel Media can actually get this truth out to the people and that we can build our own platforms to get this truth out beyond what they control.
[01:49:14.898 --> 01:49:19.399]  That's right, and therebel.media, citizensfortrump.com, we are the true rebels.
[01:49:19.439 --> 01:49:20.760]  We are the true counterculture.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:22.540]  We're trying to bring back what works.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:28.302]  Freedom, open societies, sovereignty, religious freedom, humans being personally empowered.
[01:49:28.922 --> 01:49:33.983]  Not this attack language, attack Christians, shut down freedom, bully everyone.
[01:49:34.363 --> 01:49:40.245]  It is ridiculous how uncool all the Hollywood scum are and the so-called
[01:49:41.579 --> 01:49:45.973]  You're all reporters like Colbert out there who are just posers putting out this info.
[01:49:46.193 --> 01:49:48.701]  These people are sickening establishment mouthpieces.
[01:49:50.236 --> 01:50:00.104]  We're absolutely right, and we're seeing how the Hollywood drug culture and the way that those people are brainwashed, and they're now trying to turn that brainwashing on to their own audiences, to their own people, to turn them into zombies.
[01:50:00.344 --> 01:50:03.947]  They'll immediately click and retweet and put out whatever hashtag they want.
[01:50:03.987 --> 01:50:07.770]  They want to control what you think, they want to control what you wear, they control what you eat, control what you do.
[01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:09.992]  From cradle to grave is what they're trying to sell you.
[01:50:10.272 --> 01:50:14.075]  But now, we're actually able to use our own platforms, our own channels, to speak the truth.
[01:50:14.355 --> 01:50:15.556]  We've got a long way to go.
[01:50:15.836 --> 01:50:18.477]  And Europe, unfortunately, it might be a little bit too late for them.
[01:50:18.517 --> 01:50:21.638]  But that's why it's so important for the United States.
[01:50:21.958 --> 01:50:26.180]  It's so important for us to see what's going on and to look out in the world and see where there's allies.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:26.540]  That's right.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.542]  To see for sure our worst analysis is, in fact...
[01:50:30.549 --> 01:50:32.670]  True, it's in fact worse than we even thought.
[01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:47.013]  You can see 10 years down the road where we're at if we don't all get aggressive and it is an act of total resistance against tyranny to spread Infowars.com links, to spread your links, to spread videos, to spread articles, to start your own websites, to start your own YouTubes, to get aggressive.
[01:50:47.253 --> 01:50:48.073]  We have the truth.
[01:50:48.613 --> 01:50:49.594]  We have the information.
[01:50:49.614 --> 01:50:52.374]  We're fighting a bunch of globalist cult member scum.
[01:50:52.814 --> 01:50:55.655]  We can defeat the pedophile armies of the New World Order.
[01:50:55.895 --> 01:50:57.416]  Final segment with Jack Posobiec.
[01:50:57.676 --> 01:50:58.196]  Straight ahead.
[01:50:58.256 --> 01:50:58.736]  Stay with us.
[01:51:03.494 --> 01:51:11.504]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and Liberals is sheerly maddening.
[01:51:11.684 --> 01:51:20.736]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention, the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage at the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[01:51:20.876 --> 01:51:26.318]  The Whig won the award for best fight against the system, another side Trump effect on the left, giving themselves awards.
[01:51:26.458 --> 01:51:29.399]  Check Chelsea Clinton, Barack Obama, now a James Brown Whig.
[01:51:29.419 --> 01:51:37.001]  The classy Democrat Senator Kamala Harris, also from California, decided to drop an F-bomb while speaking about health care during a public event.
[01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:42.303]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[01:51:42.503 --> 01:51:51.166]  But now The Hill has published a story, the 43 people who might run against Trump, which includes the worst of the Democrat Party, and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[01:51:51.246 --> 01:51:57.128]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus act fit of berserking.
[01:51:57.228 --> 01:52:01.449]  I'm Owen Schroer, and for InfoWars.com, the Trump effect has been huge.
[01:52:07.588 --> 01:52:09.109]  There is a crisis in America today.
[01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:11.972]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:19.699]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:23.683]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:25.185]  I have the answer for you today.
[01:52:25.585 --> 01:52:26.746]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[01:52:27.506 --> 01:52:30.489]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone and it's safe.
[01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:32.810]  No radiation compartment.
[01:52:33.231 --> 01:52:38.996]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[01:52:39.836 --> 01:52:42.298]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[01:52:42.498 --> 01:52:48.443]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[01:52:49.264 --> 01:52:50.867]  If it's a blocky pocket, this is impossible.
[01:52:51.348 --> 01:52:54.054]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[01:52:54.354 --> 01:52:58.984]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocky pocket.
[01:53:04.608 --> 01:53:09.933]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:53:10.113 --> 01:53:10.674]  I take this.
[01:53:10.954 --> 01:53:11.975]  My family takes this.
[01:53:12.075 --> 01:53:16.319]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:20.804]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:53:20.984 --> 01:53:25.528]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:53:25.608 --> 01:53:26.649]  I don't feel good.
[01:53:26.729 --> 01:53:30.252]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:53:30.492 --> 01:53:33.134]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:53:33.194 --> 01:53:38.498]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:41.421]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:53:41.941 --> 01:53:45.364]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:53:45.484 --> 01:53:47.666]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[01:53:47.726 --> 01:53:48.086]  I love it.
[01:53:48.226 --> 01:53:50.827]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:53:51.027 --> 01:53:52.008]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:53:52.048 --> 01:53:57.670]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:53:57.690 --> 01:53:59.611]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:02.132]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:54:08.155 --> 01:54:11.096]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:54:13.986 --> 01:54:28.653]  I want to get him back up for a full hour in the near future to talk about the future of Trump, the wins, the defeats.
[01:54:29.274 --> 01:54:31.074]  But look how far we've come with nationalism.
[01:54:31.134 --> 01:54:33.736]  Jack Posobiec is our guest.
[01:54:34.316 --> 01:54:37.558]  I intro'd this whole piece earlier talking about how the Louvre
[01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:57.659]  ...was commissioned and the basic design done by Francois Mitterrand, who was in the newspapers at the time, saying, I love Lucifer, I'm a Luciferian, we built this because I believe in Lucifer 666, and the crew googled it, and sure enough found, from the Encyclopedia Obscura, the Louvre Pyramid.
[01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:08.577]  And you can read where, completed in 89, the largest of the structures, commonly referred to as the Louvre Pyramid, now serves as the main entrance to the museum and is one of the city's more notable landmarks.
[01:55:08.617 --> 01:55:19.224]  The structure's Chinese-American architect claimed that the design was inspired by a trellis he had seen at the adjunct and that the Louvre Pyramid was in no way related to the monuments of Egypt.
[01:55:19.724 --> 01:55:24.127]  The Lube Pyramid raised controversy in the 80s following the publication of an official brochure.
[01:55:24.908 --> 01:55:30.872]  Twice in the pages of the brochure, it was claimed that the structure was formed of 666 individual panes of glass.
[01:55:31.332 --> 01:55:35.015]  The figure was subsequently quoted on numerous newspapers and became a widespread.
[01:55:35.415 --> 01:55:40.359]  And then it goes on, though, to have Francois Mitterrand saying that, indeed, it is dedicated to the beast.
[01:55:40.819 --> 01:55:46.824]  Revelations aside, the notions that the Lube Pyramid's 666 panes is, in fact, false tries to claim an official statement by the Lube Museum.
[01:55:47.344 --> 01:55:50.046]  Now, where was the part you showed me, though, where Francois Mitterrand said that himself?
[01:55:50.326 --> 01:55:51.446]  Because I remember seeing his quotes.
[01:55:51.486 --> 01:55:52.607]  He was asked about it at the time.
[01:55:52.827 --> 01:55:53.788]  Let's scroll back down to the bottom.
[01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:54.648]  There it is.
[01:55:55.569 --> 01:56:00.852]  They went on to say that the pyramid is dedicated to a power described in the book, in the beast, in the book of Revelation.
[01:56:00.872 --> 01:56:02.993]  The entire structure is based on the number six.
[01:56:03.373 --> 01:56:06.155]  The point is, is that you can't get past all this craziness.
[01:56:06.575 --> 01:56:09.157]  Now, briefly getting back to our guest, Jack Posobiec.
[01:56:10.377 --> 01:56:16.261]  Again, get into when you learned you were being sued and what you're planning to do and what you think this bodes for journalists.
[01:56:17.615 --> 01:56:20.278]  Absolutely, Alex, and actually just kind of hit on your piece there.
[01:56:20.298 --> 01:56:25.002]  There's a line in Ephesians where it says, the war is not about flesh and blood.
[01:56:25.022 --> 01:56:31.389]  The war is against the world rulers of darkness and the spiritual hosts of wickedness and heavenly places.
[01:56:31.449 --> 01:56:32.910]  And it's right there.
[01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:33.971]  It's biblical, all of this.
[01:56:34.331 --> 01:56:38.656]  And so, you know, these lawsuits with the French president now coming against me, it's furious.
[01:56:38.996 --> 01:56:39.917]  It's a headline for them.
[01:56:40.299 --> 01:56:47.501]  And we're going to push back with the full force of our legal team here in the United States and back in Canada with behind the First Amendment.
[01:56:47.801 --> 01:56:55.863]  So if the First Amendment can't protect journalists here in the United States under the Trump administration with AG Sessions, then I can't imagine that it's going to be able to protect anybody.
[01:56:55.883 --> 01:56:58.864]  They're going to try to find loopholes and they can't get to us legally.
[01:56:58.884 --> 01:57:00.924]  They're going to try to get to us through the Internet.
[01:57:00.964 --> 01:57:02.284]  They're going to try to de-platform us.
[01:57:02.304 --> 01:57:04.245]  They're going to try to de-platform our ISPs.
[01:57:04.485 --> 01:57:08.626]  And that's why you saw in the final hours of the Barack Obama administration,
[01:57:09.033 --> 01:57:09.393]  I don't know.
[01:57:29.305 --> 01:57:29.565]  Nothing.
[01:57:29.605 --> 01:57:31.126]  They just keep sitting there saying it.
[01:57:31.787 --> 01:57:44.856]  I think we respond by the listeners and everybody getting more aggressive, spreading our links, realizing it's a total war, hand-sharing those links, hand-sharing those videos, calling into C-SPAN, calling into talk radio and saying, Infowars.com is forbidden.
[01:57:45.176 --> 01:57:46.437]  The rebel media is forbidden.
[01:57:46.457 --> 01:57:51.900]  You know, anything the enemy's attacking, say, this is what they don't want you to see, find out why.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:58.565]  I think that's the answer, is people should celebrate the fact that we're under so much attack and realize the enemy is attacking what they're afraid of.
[01:57:59.764 --> 01:58:04.266]  Yeah, well, General Patton had a quote, he said, you're taking the most slack when you know you're right over the target.
[01:58:04.546 --> 01:58:20.053]  You know, had they not responded as forcefully as they had, had they not shown their hand as how scared they were about this massive leak about the offshore island accounts that Macron had, there's still 10 gigabytes of information here, which WikiLeaks' Julian Assange has verified is true.
[01:58:20.073 --> 01:58:22.494]  There's so much more stuff for us to investigate.
[01:58:22.534 --> 01:58:24.075]  There's so much more still to be uncovered.
[01:58:24.275 --> 01:58:26.356]  And now that he is the president, it's imperative
[01:58:26.676 --> 01:58:30.059]  For us to continue to go through this and see what the EU elites are actually up to.
[01:58:30.079 --> 01:58:30.419]  You know what?
[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:34.843]  We can do five more minutes because I'm going to get into some other news after that and we've got some other guests.
[01:58:34.863 --> 01:58:37.145]  But I want to specifically get into what's in the leaks.
[01:58:37.165 --> 01:58:37.925]  I've seen a lot of it.
[01:58:38.606 --> 01:58:39.947]  I mean, what they're so afraid of.
[01:58:39.967 --> 01:58:41.748]  Let's talk about that hack straight ahead.
[01:58:41.768 --> 01:58:44.170]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with hour number three.
[01:58:44.190 --> 01:58:45.271]  Then Leanne McAdoo is coming up.
[01:58:45.591 --> 01:58:47.793]  Roger Stone with breaking exclusive news in about eight minutes.
[01:58:50.075 --> 01:58:52.277]  Inside the White House with who the moles are.
[01:58:53.254 --> 01:59:02.245]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and Liberals is sheerly maddening.
[01:59:02.265 --> 01:59:10.515]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention, the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage at the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[01:59:10.655 --> 01:59:16.101]  The Whig won the award for best fight against the system, another side Trump effect on the left, giving themselves awards.
[01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:19.184]  Check Chelsea Clinton, Barack Obama, now a James Brown Whig.
[01:59:19.204 --> 01:59:26.772]  The classy Democrat Senator Kamala Harris, also from California, decided to drop an F-bomb while speaking about healthcare during a public event.
[01:59:26.912 --> 01:59:32.098]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[01:59:32.278 --> 01:59:40.944]  But now The Hill has published a story, the 43 people who might run against Trump, which includes the worst of the Democrat Party, and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[01:59:41.024 --> 01:59:46.909]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus act fit of berserking.
[01:59:47.009 --> 01:59:51.292]  I'm Owen Schroer, and for InfoWars.com, the Trump effect has been huge.
[01:59:54.474 --> 02:00:00.359]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.761 --> 02:00:08.763]  Wow, it's an exciting town to be alive, isn't it?
[02:00:11.865 --> 02:00:16.309]  We rally patriots worldwide in defense.
[02:00:17.129 --> 02:00:21.593]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:21.973 --> 02:00:24.935]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:36.037]  So, if Macron's so powerful, the new French president, why is he suing Jack Posobiec, who reported on the whistleblowers, the leaks, the info.
[02:00:36.057 --> 02:00:50.287]  So just recap for folks, instead of mainstream media distortion on this, what's really happened, what's unfolding, why they're suing you, why they're so upset, and what we're learning about, reportedly, the gay porn, the gay escorts, the drugs, I mean, what's going on here?
[02:00:50.548 --> 02:00:54.791]  Why this guy is such a little darling of the establishment, youngest French president ever.
[02:00:55.936 --> 02:01:05.280]  Sure Alex, and so we saw the Macron gate last week where it was revealed that he has these offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, tax evasion, billions of dollars.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:16.524]  It was also then revealed in these emails that number one, the Macron campaign was funding Antifa, was behind the Antifa riots in Paris where they were setting police officers on fire on May 1st.
[02:01:16.845 --> 02:01:20.386]  We find out activities where they've been selling and buying
[02:01:21.202 --> 02:01:23.663]  Designer drugs that they're saying they're for the boss.
[02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:27.464]  This drug called MMC3, a sophisticated drug.
[02:01:27.724 --> 02:01:35.467]  He's also on the list, essentially, of this homosexual cult sort of mailing list that he's on.
[02:01:35.487 --> 02:01:36.707]  So with the drugs and all that stuff.
[02:01:36.727 --> 02:01:40.469]  And let's keep in mind that Macron himself is a victim of pedophilia.
[02:01:40.489 --> 02:01:44.210]  So we know from a very early age he was involved in pedophilia himself.
[02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:47.431]  The victim of his own wife, his former high school teacher.
[02:01:47.742 --> 02:01:59.010]  Which was then what vaulted him into the Rothschild Agency, where the Rothschild Bank was actually funding his own campaign, actual campaign events, these glitzy cocktail parties, designer drugs everywhere.
[02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:13.741]  And me reporting on all of this, which has been verified from themselves and Wikileaks to be true, has led them not in turn to come clean and say, okay, yes, we did this, but no, they're suing me and saying that the leaks are false, even though they're suing me for saying I hacked their emails, so I'm not sure which one it is.
[02:02:14.568 --> 02:02:19.359]  That's right, they're saying you hacked their emails or the Russians did and gave it to you, but it's not accurate.
[02:02:19.379 --> 02:02:20.401]  They're not saying it's all fake.
[02:02:20.622 --> 02:02:21.764]  They're saying it's not accurate.
[02:02:23.177 --> 02:02:32.404]  Right, and so they're trying to play this tightrope dance of saying, well, some of them aren't accurate, but some of them are accurate, but you also hacked us, but they're also fake.
[02:02:32.565 --> 02:02:34.346]  But of course, nobody should look at them.
[02:02:34.686 --> 02:02:46.616]  And the media in France, just the same way the media in the United States during WikiLeaks said this, they said if you tweet or post or share anything about the Macron leaks, the French government's going to come after you, and they're going to come and try to stop you.
[02:02:46.876 --> 02:02:50.739]  And I think that right there tells you just how scared they are of what's in these documents.
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:52.661]  Wow, you're saying there's thousands more?
[02:02:53.935 --> 02:02:54.896]  There's tens of thousands.
[02:02:54.936 --> 02:03:03.942]  We literally haven't had enough time possibly for our researchers at Rebel Media or the people on 4chan to go through these things, to translate them, and to make all the connections to find what's out there.
[02:03:04.142 --> 02:03:07.825]  They were using Bitcoin to buy designer drugs on the black market out in France.
[02:03:07.865 --> 02:03:08.766]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:03:10.167 --> 02:03:19.293]  Now, the story is, it's admitted with him and his older wife that there's a lot of weird stuff going on, and that she did know him back when she was married and all this.
[02:03:19.973 --> 02:03:20.574]  What's going on there?
[02:03:21.587 --> 02:03:22.688]  That's right.
[02:03:22.808 --> 02:03:27.272]  He was her high school student when he was 14 and 15.
[02:03:27.312 --> 02:03:36.240]  But it was stated that that was when the relationship started, but that no sexual acts began until he was of legal age in France, which I believe is 18.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:40.663]  So that right there tells me something very, very fishy is going on.
[02:03:40.683 --> 02:03:43.666]  She has children that are older than him, as a matter of fact.
[02:03:44.145 --> 02:03:55.848]  And it may be a way that they found this guy very, very young, and they were using that to essentially, you know, turn him into a puppet, turn him into a marionette, and now they're plying him with drugs, keeping him drugged up and getting him to do whatever they want.
[02:03:56.368 --> 02:04:05.230]  So yeah, you've got the article here at Got News where they're showing you this stuff, the way that they're controlling him, the same kind of mind control they use for celebrities, for actors, for musicians that we see around the world.
[02:04:06.211 --> 02:04:07.871]  Now, what is this designer drug?
[02:04:09.741 --> 02:04:24.827]  So this MMC3, it's essentially a combination of ecstasy and crystal meth, but they made it in such a way that it's synthetic that it actually gets around most government security screenings and gets around most where you're trying to import it.
[02:04:24.867 --> 02:04:29.969]  You can synthesize it rather than have it to be grown or make it in a laboratory, so it's easier to get out.
[02:04:29.989 --> 02:04:37.692]  It's extremely expensive and it's incredibly illegal, but there's easier ways for them to get it in the EU, and that's one of the things that the elites are absolutely doing.
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.902]  Well, I tell you, it just never ends.
[02:04:41.282 --> 02:04:43.463]  Jack Posobiec, citizensfortrump.com.
[02:04:43.804 --> 02:04:45.345]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:45.405 --> 02:04:45.985]  Great job.
[02:04:46.145 --> 02:04:47.847]  We'll follow this lawsuit.
[02:04:47.887 --> 02:04:52.730]  I bet they drop it quick now that he won, because they do not want you to be able to get into what he's doing.
[02:04:52.770 --> 02:04:55.972]  But, you know, the French don't live in a free country anymore, so we'll see what happens.
[02:04:56.012 --> 02:04:57.273]  Jack, we salute you.
[02:04:57.293 --> 02:04:57.954]  Great job, buddy.

[02:07:02.782 --> 02:07:08.984]  The anthropogenic globalists have won the French presidential election, with Macron becoming the youngest French president ever.
[02:07:09.084 --> 02:07:12.925]  Macron won in a landslide, thanks to many simply voting against Le Pen.
[02:07:13.085 --> 02:07:15.725]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election.
[02:07:15.945 --> 02:07:22.667]  Leaked documents revealed Macron would cater to Islam, Antifa, the EU, as well as his own personal offshore bank accounts.
[02:07:22.847 --> 02:07:24.908]  There will be no investigating into the U.S.
[02:07:24.988 --> 02:07:29.609]  meddling in the French election, despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S.
[02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:34.050]  news network endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist.
[02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:41.272]  The fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist, as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[02:07:41.352 --> 02:07:45.773]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive la France.
[02:07:46.073 --> 02:07:50.095]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate.
[02:07:50.235 --> 02:07:51.636]  They cheer hooray for France.
[02:07:51.876 --> 02:07:52.756]  Long live France!
[02:07:53.016 --> 02:07:59.440]  As this election will likely mark the end of France and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:02.081]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:08:20.609 --> 02:08:25.053]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:25.653 --> 02:08:27.115]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.437 --> 02:08:33.981]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[02:08:34.861 --> 02:08:37.283]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:08:37.404 --> 02:08:40.266]  Evil minds that plot destruction.
[02:08:51.874 --> 02:08:55.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[02:08:55.757 --> 02:09:00.020]  He's worked in nine different campaigns and part of four different administrations.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:07.806]  He joins us with exclusives today on the heels of Macron's victory in France, a big victory for the globalists.
[02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:12.330]  We know that the Trump White House and State Department is literally filled
[02:09:13.243 --> 02:09:17.146]  With different Democratic Party globalists, activists, and operatives.
[02:09:17.586 --> 02:09:31.876]  And Roger Stone, last night on my Sunday show, at the end of the broadcast, joined us just to give people a little bit of a prelude, or d'oeuvre, of the hardcore, exclusive, game-changing data you are about to hear.
[02:09:33.057 --> 02:09:40.602]  This is the moles in the White House, and the moles in the State Department, Condoleezza Rice directing it with Donna Brazile.
[02:09:42.403 --> 02:09:47.812]  That's right, the same one getting all the answers for the debate and the questions from CNN.
[02:09:48.433 --> 02:09:52.319]  And Roger Stone is about to name names and give us the information right now.
[02:09:52.379 --> 02:09:53.120]  Best-selling author.
[02:09:54.119 --> 02:10:00.345]  Of course, of the latest book out exposing the making of the President 2016, what's happened with Donald Trump.
[02:10:00.585 --> 02:10:11.856]  We'll then look at the besieged President and many of the victories he's had, but the media again openly and now admitting they're preparing in Congress a bipartisan move under the 25th Amendment to declare him insane!
[02:10:12.637 --> 02:10:14.038]  If he's insane, we need more of it.
[02:10:14.538 --> 02:10:18.420]  But I guess in a kingdom of crazy people, the one sane person would be seen as insane.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.783]  If we teleported back to the Aztecs when they were human-sacrificing 1,000 years ago and said, stop it, they'd say, you're crazy.
[02:10:24.543 --> 02:10:28.125]  Or if we teleported back to 1945 and Hitler's killing a bunch of people, he'd say, don't do that.
[02:10:28.145 --> 02:10:29.326]  He'd say, you're crazy.
[02:10:29.806 --> 02:10:30.846]  So I guess we are crazy.
[02:10:31.287 --> 02:10:39.871]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, joins us in this huge firestorm we just had Jack Posobiec on, who being shooed by the French president,
[02:10:40.885 --> 02:10:45.272]  They say for hacking his emails, but it's all fake they say, but it's real.
[02:10:46.053 --> 02:10:48.176]  So it's really thickening here in the plot.
[02:10:48.636 --> 02:10:52.402]  So joining us again is Roger Stone with more Bombshell exclusive.
[02:10:52.462 --> 02:10:54.225]  Roger, thank you for giving us the exclusive today.
[02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:59.720]  First of all, Alex, I want to join you in saluting my friend Jack Bosowiak.
[02:11:00.281 --> 02:11:03.304]  We call him Jumping Jack Flash in the movement.
[02:11:03.645 --> 02:11:13.717]  He is a typical of the young investigative journalists, hungry for the truth, and just won't accept the, you know, the pablum being spit up by the mainstream media.
[02:11:14.736 --> 02:11:23.423]  Alex, it is really shocking because I was among those who was a supporter of Rex Tillerson, at least conceptually on paper.
[02:11:23.503 --> 02:11:30.168]  I like the idea of an outsider, someone who wasn't part of the foggy bottom culture of the U.S.
[02:11:30.188 --> 02:11:31.049]  State Department.
[02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:44.079]  The fact that Tillerson has been heavily influenced and mentored, really his patron, now I learn, is Condoleezza Rice.
[02:11:45.059 --> 02:11:47.400]  That is an extraordinary development.
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:12:00.586]  Evidently, as Steve Bannon was aware of this at the time that Tillison's name was put forward, but because they were so desperate to have someone to stop Mitt Romney, Tillison got this job.
[02:12:01.443 --> 02:12:21.019]  I can tell you that the logs downstairs at the State Department show that whenever Tillotson is out of the country, which is for the Secretary of State most of the time, well, in those instances, Condoleezza Rice is actually holding meetings inside the State Department with various department heads.
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:28.846]  We also know that she was instrumental in the placement of a fellow named Brian Hook
[02:12:29.656 --> 02:12:40.659]  Now, Brian Hook is essentially the key spokesperson, the first person Rex Tillerson sees in the morning, the last person he sees at night at State Department.
[02:12:41.399 --> 02:12:43.980]  And Mr. Hook is a hardcore never-Trumper.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:51.022]  He was a co-signer of a letter from the John Hay Initiative trashing Donald Trump.
[02:12:51.042 --> 02:12:58.704]  This is a neoconservative group that over 100 so-called Republican foreign policy experts
[02:12:59.264 --> 02:13:05.990]  Co-signed, attacking Trump's foreign policy bona fides and capability.
[02:13:06.871 --> 02:13:10.134]  Mr. Hook is now in the State Department.
[02:13:10.174 --> 02:13:11.896]  This boggles the mind.
[02:13:12.936 --> 02:13:24.046]  I am told that Mr. Hook was pushed for this job by Condoleezza Rice, largely because she seeks to block, there's Mr. Hook, she seeks to block the appointment
[02:13:25.089 --> 02:13:32.791]  Of a true patriot as NATO Ambassador Rick Grenell.
[02:13:33.591 --> 02:13:41.574]  Evidently Rice sees Grenell as a future Secretary of State, which she of course sees herself as.
[02:13:41.834 --> 02:13:44.815]  She wants a reprise in Washington.
[02:13:45.515 --> 02:13:48.716]  This is very bad news for the
[02:13:49.816 --> 02:13:53.157]  ...interventionist wing that elected Donald Trump.
[02:13:53.197 --> 02:14:14.064]  Now, the real problem at the State Department, Alex, is that, rights previous, the President's Chief of Staff refuses to tell the various department heads, let's start at State, this is going to be your Assistant Secretary for this, this gentleman is going to be your Assistant Secretary of that, this woman is going to be your General Counsel, and so on.
[02:14:14.764 --> 02:14:19.987]  The cabinet officers have this quaint idea that they are allowed to choose their own people without White House vetting.
[02:14:20.767 --> 02:14:25.970]  And that is where you get this this lending party of neocons.
[02:14:26.830 --> 02:14:33.033]  We can show you from the Washington Post by scrolling on the State Department positions.
[02:14:33.093 --> 02:14:34.834]  I think we can pull that up.
[02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:38.396]  And I will show you what you have here is a stalemate.
[02:14:39.016 --> 02:14:42.778]  Meaning, Priebus refuses to put forward names.
[02:14:43.319 --> 02:14:48.582]  The names put forward, let's just roll up here to the state a little bit and you will see what I mean.
[02:14:49.202 --> 02:14:54.345]  The State Department puts forward names that are not politically suitable, i.e.
[02:14:54.925 --> 02:14:56.086]  anti-Trumpers.
[02:14:56.126 --> 02:14:57.527]  There we have 119 positions in state.
[02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:02.592]  Let's go through the list here, just below that.
[02:15:02.672 --> 02:15:05.634]  You will see, Legal Advisor, no nominee.
[02:15:05.734 --> 02:15:08.135]  Chief Financial Officer, no nominee.
[02:15:08.895 --> 02:15:11.136]  Undersecretary for Management, no nominee.
[02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:13.598]  Undersecretary for Arms Control, no nominee.
[02:15:14.058 --> 02:15:16.819]  Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, no nominee.
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:19.881]  And so on, and so on, and so forth.
[02:15:20.819 --> 02:15:27.222]  Because the State Department puts forward neocons and globalists unacceptable to the White House.
[02:15:27.302 --> 02:15:40.089]  And let me just add this, because we're 110 days in, and admittedly, it's come out that the State Department's in total rebellion against Rex Tillerson, and other agencies are doing the same thing, they just totally ignore him.
[02:15:40.449 --> 02:15:48.253]  Nobody good comes forward, or they're all anti-Trumpers, and then they use the national security clearance stuff to have the FBI block anybody that is good.
[02:15:49.213 --> 02:15:50.675]  And so we're wondering how this is happening.
[02:15:51.155 --> 02:15:53.057]  Is Rex Tillerson a total rube?
[02:15:53.438 --> 02:15:55.180]  A total nincompoop?
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:16:00.646]  Or is he controlled in that he's got Condi in there knowingly sabotaging everything?
[02:16:01.026 --> 02:16:05.431]  Or is he just doing this, you know, to try to be trendy or try to be nice to the old bushes?
[02:16:06.112 --> 02:16:08.895]  You know, is he a naive ne'er-do-well?
[02:16:09.356 --> 02:16:10.397]  Because you look at Dish,
[02:16:10.737 --> 02:16:13.819]  We're 110 days in and basically none of the top positions.
[02:16:13.859 --> 02:16:14.620]  That's kind of good.
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:20.164]  It's showing at least it's being blocked by somebody knows what's going on, but it's also bad because nothing's happened.
[02:16:20.885 --> 02:16:22.146]  In a sense, let me be clear.
[02:16:22.606 --> 02:16:27.510]  The reason you have a lot of gin is the White House must make the nominations, not the departments.
[02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:28.891]  They don't make the nominations.
[02:16:29.412 --> 02:16:31.573]  So the departments are sending over their candidates.
[02:16:32.014 --> 02:16:33.715]  The White Houses are blocking them.
[02:16:33.935 --> 02:16:35.016]  No one is nominated.
[02:16:35.216 --> 02:16:35.777]  Stalemate.
[02:16:36.297 --> 02:16:36.617]  Empty.
[02:16:36.657 --> 02:16:38.178]  And the problem with that, Alex, is
[02:16:39.059 --> 02:16:41.880]  The Obama mice are in those positions.
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.761]  They continue to run the government in all those positions.
[02:16:44.781 --> 02:16:46.162]  So that's why it's not a stalemate.
[02:16:46.282 --> 02:16:49.683]  That's why them only giving them never Trumpers keeps the Obama people in.
[02:16:50.383 --> 02:16:51.324]  And whose fault is it?
[02:16:51.364 --> 02:16:52.244]  Let me explain this.
[02:16:53.064 --> 02:16:54.685]  This is the fault of Reince Priebus.
[02:16:55.345 --> 02:16:58.727]  Do you think Hamilton Jordan or H.R.
[02:16:58.807 --> 02:17:09.535]  Bob Haldeman or Andy Card or James A. Baker III would have not gone to the department head and said, this is the person you're nominating for this job.
[02:17:09.815 --> 02:17:11.856]  This is the person you're nominating for this job.
[02:17:12.137 --> 02:17:14.078]  This is the person we're nominating for this job.
[02:17:14.398 --> 02:17:15.499]  There is no sign off.
[02:17:15.559 --> 02:17:17.000]  It has never worked that way.
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:21.343]  But someone gave Rex the idea that he could choose his own people.
[02:17:21.843 --> 02:17:24.085]  And let me point out to you, the first one he wanted was
[02:17:24.765 --> 02:17:25.826]  Elliot Abrams.
[02:17:26.967 --> 02:17:27.968]  Neocon.
[02:17:28.509 --> 02:17:29.910]  Neocon bad guy.
[02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:31.591]  Darth Vader, for God's sakes.
[02:17:31.831 --> 02:17:34.193]  Why don't we just get Richard Perl himself in here?
[02:17:34.674 --> 02:17:36.455]  This is an absurdity.
[02:17:37.476 --> 02:17:40.839]  I blame rights for the lobjam.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.181]  By the way, this is throughout the government.
[02:17:43.201 --> 02:17:45.884]  We're just using state today as an example.
[02:17:46.244 --> 02:17:49.146]  So we're now documenting how Trump's been sabotaged from within.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:51.549]  And while we think it's just a stalemate, it's not.
[02:17:51.589 --> 02:18:03.479]  The Obama people are in there beavering away as usual, running State Department with congressional hearings saying we're Russian agents with no proof, saying shut down the free press as they direct Google in a jihad against the American resistance.
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:13.448]  Not only that, but the idea that we would have a never-Trumper blocking a Trump loyalist like Rick Grinnell
[02:18:14.551 --> 02:18:23.654]  Who's highly qualified for that NATO post and who did more surrogate speaking and traveling on behalf of the Trump-Pence ticket than virtually any Republican I know.
[02:18:24.675 --> 02:18:25.855]  It's an intro.
[02:18:25.875 --> 02:18:26.255]  Sure, sure.
[02:18:26.295 --> 02:18:36.679]  So all the real Americana, Freedom Caucus type patriots, none of them had actually got Trump elected or even allowed anywhere near the reins of power because they'd actually do what they said they'd do.
[02:18:37.951 --> 02:18:49.400]  And we have taken some Trump transition documents that we have obtained and determined a list of exactly who Condoleezza Rice has recommended for various positions.
[02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:54.164]  And now we are tracing where they are in the White House personnel process.
[02:18:54.204 --> 02:18:56.386]  Well, when can we get Dr. Corsi to publish this?
[02:18:56.406 --> 02:18:57.487]  You know, he'd be a great guy to do that.
[02:18:58.572 --> 02:19:04.045]  He would be an ideal person for that story and I will consult with him almost immediately.
[02:19:04.425 --> 02:19:08.274]  The other thing I wanted to touch on is the growing role of Dr. Henry Kissinger.
[02:19:09.315 --> 02:19:17.620]  Now the last time I saw Dr. Kissinger was when Arthur Schwartz and Dr. Kissinger and I dined at Cipriani in New York.
[02:19:18.501 --> 02:19:20.982]  He has amazing energy for a man in his 90s.
[02:19:21.843 --> 02:19:28.547]  And I can report that Kissinger recently carried a personal message to the Chinese from the President.
[02:19:29.427 --> 02:19:33.071]  This was after the Chinese trip to Mar-a-Lago.
[02:19:33.091 --> 02:19:36.595]  I cannot tell you the contents of that message.
[02:19:37.055 --> 02:19:50.769]  I can only tell you that this back-channel diplomacy is working, and we probably have a warmer relationship between the two heads of government, the Chinese and America, than any time during the Obama administration.
[02:19:51.209 --> 02:19:53.374]  All right, so Trump's really pulling off some big coups.
[02:19:53.414 --> 02:19:54.536]  Stay there, Roger Stone.
[02:19:54.837 --> 02:19:58.465]  Let's come back and break down exactly what this means and how we turn this around.
[02:19:58.505 --> 02:20:01.110]  You're getting exclusives here, folks, on why there's a logjam.
[02:20:06.385 --> 02:20:07.726]  This is where you get breaking news.
[02:20:08.126 --> 02:20:11.048]  McMaster has a plan to send in ground troops to Syria.
[02:20:11.428 --> 02:20:15.450]  That story actually broke here on InfoWars four or five days ago.
[02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:16.491]  Bloomberg is covering it.
[02:20:16.531 --> 02:20:24.976]  So essentially whatever you're reading in the news today or tomorrow, this is all going to be on InfoWars five, ten, fifteen days before it ever reaches the mainstream.
[02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.417]  That is how good the sourcing is here.
[02:20:27.457 --> 02:20:28.378]  This is for real news.
[02:20:28.598 --> 02:20:37.207]  That is why not only are they trying to divide the base against Trump, they are now slandering Alex and me and other patriots, calling us Russian agents.
[02:20:37.347 --> 02:20:44.615]  They realize that this is the only place for real news and now they're trying to attack and lie about us and claiming that we're Russian agents and all that.
[02:20:45.916 --> 02:20:47.157]  We're right, we're right, we're right.
[02:20:47.217 --> 02:20:53.740]  They keep saying we're lying, we're lying, we're lying, because weeks ago, and then last week, we said, no, McMaster wants the troops.
[02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.501]  That's my source from the White House.
[02:20:55.561 --> 02:20:56.381]  Then you have your source.
[02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.142]  He wants 150,000 on the ground.
[02:20:58.382 --> 02:21:11.149]  Now Bloomberg comes out today and says Trump has told Bloomberg, I don't want a war, but it turns out the aides were doing exactly what we said, trying to jockey and get them in place and move artillery in that wasn't for ISIS, but was for Assad.
[02:21:11.969 --> 02:21:12.469]  Exactly.
[02:21:12.509 --> 02:21:15.511]  So Bloomberg is now reporting what we covered a week ago.
[02:21:16.031 --> 02:21:21.993]  And one thing that frustrates me a little bit is the idea that we need Bloomberg to validate our reporting.
[02:21:22.094 --> 02:21:23.134]  Because this is real news.
[02:21:23.194 --> 02:21:25.995]  We don't make stuff up like ABC does, like Bloomberg does.
[02:21:26.335 --> 02:21:27.196]  They fabricate things.
[02:21:27.256 --> 02:21:29.597]  I put a transcript out of what the president said on Monday.
[02:21:29.677 --> 02:21:31.938]  It's what the president said, and I'm not going to say where it came from.
[02:21:32.558 --> 02:21:34.419]  Everybody knows we have contact with the President.
[02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:37.160]  The media is attacking that, saying, oh look, Alex is making this up.
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:37.620]  What?
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:38.260]  I said it?
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:41.261]  It came out three days later, out of his mouth, the exact same words.
[02:21:41.521 --> 02:21:49.364]  And they are so desperate for war now that they're trying to claim that us, by trying to oppose a ground war in Syria, trying to save American lives.
[02:21:49.644 --> 02:21:52.065]  I mean, Alex, when I did that live stream, 11 hours,
[02:21:53.746 --> 02:21:56.748]  So many mothers called in and said, my son has PTSD.
[02:21:56.788 --> 02:21:57.629]  This is so sad.
[02:21:58.089 --> 02:21:59.090]  You know, it was heartbreaking.
[02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:01.451]  I could hardly even stay on the line.
[02:22:01.471 --> 02:22:02.131]  It was so sad.
[02:22:02.632 --> 02:22:04.533]  Moms do not want to do another war.
[02:22:04.553 --> 02:22:06.474]  They do not want the McMaster plan to go through.
[02:22:06.835 --> 02:22:07.255]  Exactly.
[02:22:07.335 --> 02:22:08.456]  And again, we love our military.
[02:22:08.496 --> 02:22:09.456]  We criticize the wars.
[02:22:09.476 --> 02:22:12.838]  It's because it's not for our national sovereignty.
[02:22:12.858 --> 02:22:13.699]  It's not for our interests.
[02:22:13.779 --> 02:22:17.041]  This is one of the most elite publications published by the Rothschilds.
[02:22:17.081 --> 02:22:18.042]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[02:22:19.156 --> 02:22:23.500]  And they literally say, we're dupe idiots, and Assad tells us what to say.
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:26.902]  So now it's not just we're dupes of Putin, now it's Assad.
[02:22:26.962 --> 02:22:27.323]  No, no, no.
[02:22:27.583 --> 02:22:29.625]  We said first on Wednesday, false flag.
[02:22:29.945 --> 02:22:31.686]  We have the articles, the history, all of it.
[02:22:31.726 --> 02:22:32.367]  You did as well.
[02:22:32.867 --> 02:22:34.589]  Then, over the next week and a half,
[02:22:35.249 --> 02:22:39.012]  Everybody else from Putin to Ron Paul, everybody else came out and said it was a false flag.
[02:22:39.052 --> 02:22:40.753]  Again, we're the progenitors.
[02:22:41.073 --> 02:22:48.398]  We're not here grabbing it, you know, from Assad, how a pair of self-publicists wound up as apologists for Assad.
[02:22:48.678 --> 02:22:50.339]  We're not apologizing for Assad.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.561]  He didn't start the Civil War six years ago.
[02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:53.982]  He's never done anything to us.
[02:22:54.182 --> 02:22:55.123]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[02:22:55.223 --> 02:23:01.187]  Everything we say has just docked because we're going off what's already there and the sources we have.
[02:23:04.068 --> 02:23:05.469]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:23:05.509 --> 02:23:06.590]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:23:06.850 --> 02:23:07.771]  Why is this so good?
[02:23:08.051 --> 02:23:13.296]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:23:13.376 --> 02:23:26.949]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:23:27.009 --> 02:23:28.370]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:23:29.131 --> 02:23:30.712]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:23:30.792 --> 02:23:33.294]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:23:33.374 --> 02:23:34.635]  These are all parasites.
[02:23:34.695 --> 02:23:35.776]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:23:35.796 --> 02:23:36.837]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:23:37.157 --> 02:23:41.480]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:23:41.681 --> 02:23:44.843]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:23:44.923 --> 02:23:48.004]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:23:48.044 --> 02:23:49.045]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:23:49.085 --> 02:23:49.625]  Living Defense.
[02:23:49.925 --> 02:23:50.966]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:51.026 --> 02:23:52.046]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:23:52.066 --> 02:23:54.147]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:23:54.787 --> 02:23:56.648]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:57.809]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:58.069 --> 02:23:59.950]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:02.291]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:24:14.210 --> 02:24:17.632]  Folks, I got so focused on news last hour, I didn't plug one time.
[02:24:18.592 --> 02:24:20.293]  We are here because of your financial support.
[02:24:21.053 --> 02:24:22.874]  You spreading our links, our videos, our articles.
[02:24:22.934 --> 02:24:23.755]  We're in the Info War.
[02:24:24.515 --> 02:24:25.816]  And we're changing the world together.
[02:24:26.416 --> 02:24:30.718]  And Info War is seen as the leading resistance movement in the media.
[02:24:30.838 --> 02:24:32.419]  And so that's why we're under the most attack.
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:39.503]  We've got great non-GMO toothpaste that's back in that has no fluoride and has iodine and colloidal silver in it.
[02:24:40.686 --> 02:24:41.828]  Super Blue is back in stock.
[02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:44.192]  DNA Force is about to sell out today.
[02:24:44.673 --> 02:24:47.157]  Paul Watson's Conservatism is the new counterculture t-shirt.
[02:24:47.718 --> 02:24:48.680]  It's a special edition.
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:50.643]  We're about to change the color and print a little bit.
[02:24:51.064 --> 02:24:52.206]  So a new edition is going to be out.
[02:24:52.286 --> 02:24:53.668]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:24:53.688 --> 02:24:54.089]  That's there.
[02:24:54.987 --> 02:24:55.988]  We're about to sell out of X2.
[02:24:56.008 --> 02:25:02.796]  It's going to be about two weeks until more comes in and then it may not, we may not have more at that point because we're trying to get another source of the Deep Earth Crystals.
[02:25:03.437 --> 02:25:04.418]  These are amazing products.
[02:25:04.478 --> 02:25:06.520]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:06.881 --> 02:25:08.903]  And again, your purchases make everything we do here possible.
[02:25:08.923 --> 02:25:11.066]  So thank you for your support and your prayers.
[02:25:11.987 --> 02:25:15.271]  Roger Stone, continuing here in the time we have left with you.
[02:25:16.431 --> 02:25:18.612]  For some, this is probably dry-sounding news.
[02:25:18.712 --> 02:25:19.712]  Okay, they're blocking Trump.
[02:25:19.752 --> 02:25:20.512]  Tell us something we don't know.
[02:25:20.992 --> 02:25:21.873]  It's outrageous.
[02:25:21.973 --> 02:25:22.793]  It's unprecedented.
[02:25:22.833 --> 02:25:25.714]  I've never heard of something like this in modern times in government.
[02:25:26.734 --> 02:25:29.215]  And it shows that Trump's trying to block the bad guys.
[02:25:29.275 --> 02:25:35.456]  But, again, does he get the tactic that then Obama's people, probably even worse, end up staying in power?
[02:25:35.696 --> 02:25:36.937]  Don't they get what's happening here?
[02:25:36.977 --> 02:25:37.897]  What does Trump need to do?
[02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:54.075]  Well, it is outrageous to me, Alex, that this fellow like Brian Hook, who was an Assistant Secretary for International Organizations in the Bush State Department, was a Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to Mitt Romney.
[02:25:54.576 --> 02:25:58.157]  Why is this man in the Trump State Department?
[02:25:59.037 --> 02:26:04.722]  This is an outrage and we will see more of it if the logjam is not broken.
[02:26:05.343 --> 02:26:10.827]  The president needs an aggressive strategy to fill the second and third levels of government.
[02:26:10.867 --> 02:26:18.174]  The deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, the councillors, the deputy councils and so on.
[02:26:18.734 --> 02:26:21.436]  We are way behind other presidents in this regard.
[02:26:21.536 --> 02:26:24.179]  Now, if the president had appointed a chief of staff,
[02:26:25.103 --> 02:26:36.510]  Like Ed Martin or David Urban and any number of capable people, they would have had a plan in place to select, vet and jam through their appointees.
[02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:38.431]  Instead you have chaos.
[02:26:38.812 --> 02:26:41.673]  No one's told the secretaries they don't make these choices.
[02:26:42.014 --> 02:26:46.436]  The White House won't assert itself on the secretaries who must make the choices.
[02:26:46.857 --> 02:26:50.179]  It's organized chaos and the beneficiary
[02:26:51.019 --> 02:26:52.020]  ...is Barack Obama.
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:59.123]  And the leaks come out of our intelligence services happen because we have not replaced the leakers.
[02:27:00.344 --> 02:27:03.805]  This is a giant problem the President must confront.
[02:27:04.086 --> 02:27:12.050]  Now some could argue the President's trying to hire his opposition, but they're only stabbing him in the back that much more because they have to kill the image of a nationalistic leader.
[02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:14.771]  They have to kill that image so other countries don't follow suit.
[02:27:15.091 --> 02:27:20.278]  Doesn't Trump know that even if he tries to sell out, which I'm not saying he's doing, they're going to destroy him one way or the other?
[02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:22.561]  The only way he wins is defeating these people.
[02:27:23.623 --> 02:27:29.791]  I understand the cosmetics of having some people in your administration who work for you in the election.
[02:27:30.532 --> 02:27:33.715]  Richard Nixon had Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a noted liberal.
[02:27:33.815 --> 02:27:35.436]  He read Moynihan's memos.
[02:27:35.937 --> 02:27:40.981]  Then he read Pat Buchanan's memos, eviscerating Moynihan's memos.
[02:27:41.901 --> 02:27:47.006]  I understand that kind of symbolicism, but there should be a Democrat!
[02:27:47.606 --> 02:28:06.627]  In this cabinet, former Congressman Harold Ford Jr., very respected on transportation issues, was more than willing to be in this cabinet, was passed over for Mitch McConnell's wife, who is the longest serving member of the Bush cabinet, Elaine Chao.
[02:28:08.008 --> 02:28:08.549]  You tell me.
[02:28:11.135 --> 02:28:11.716]  Absolutely.
[02:28:12.436 --> 02:28:14.558]  Well, we've got about a minute and a half left here, Roger.
[02:28:14.598 --> 02:28:16.000]  What else can we as listeners do?
[02:28:16.801 --> 02:28:19.183]  The president needs a hatchet man, Alex.
[02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:30.834]  He needs somebody who understands who elected him, who opposed him, who our constituency out in the country is that we have to keep intact and goes through these departments and begins firing people.
[02:28:31.194 --> 02:28:35.639]  But sadly, most of the firings will have to stop ultimately at the White House
[02:28:36.479 --> 02:28:40.722]  Why doesn't Trump bring in a Rand Paul and somebody like a Pat Buchanan to just give him the basic ropes?
[02:28:41.242 --> 02:28:45.905]  Pat Buchanan should be in that White House three or four days a week just advising the President.
[02:29:00.011 --> 02:29:01.713]  Well, it's kind of ironic you say that.
[02:29:01.834 --> 02:29:05.278]  Pat did that for Nixon, then he came back and did it for Reagan.
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:11.226]  And the President and Pat now, despite some old history, get along quite well.
[02:29:12.574 --> 02:29:22.699]  On the other hand, and I like Rand Paul and I like a lot of what he's doing, the personality styles of the two men will never, never mesh.
[02:29:23.259 --> 02:29:25.981]  But this can be done at the staff level.
[02:29:26.561 --> 02:29:30.303]  There are many people from the campaign who are highly capable.
[02:29:31.843 --> 02:29:34.424]  Please work with Dr. Corsi, or if you write an article, I want to put this out.
[02:29:34.444 --> 02:29:35.324]  This is big news.
[02:29:35.804 --> 02:29:36.764]  It solves a lot of mysteries.
[02:29:36.784 --> 02:29:39.665]  You've got the exclusive documents of what's happening inside the White House.
[02:29:39.685 --> 02:29:40.365]  That is so big.
[02:29:40.405 --> 02:29:41.105]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[02:29:41.125 --> 02:29:41.825]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:29:42.505 --> 02:29:43.065]  Great to be here.
[02:29:43.085 --> 02:29:43.725]  Many thanks, Alex.
[02:29:43.745 --> 02:29:44.465]  You bet, my friend.
[02:29:44.585 --> 02:29:51.947]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with Leanne McAdoo, the whole transhumanist movement, telling you what your future is going to be, as if you don't have free will and a lot more.
[02:29:52.047 --> 02:29:52.867]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.347 --> 02:29:54.927]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.847 --> 02:29:58.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.325 --> 02:30:05.987]  We've taken Brain Force and made it Brain Force Plus.

[02:30:18.395 --> 02:30:24.219]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.

[02:30:33.345 --> 02:30:39.668]  The anthropogenic globalists have won the French presidential election, with Macron becoming the youngest French president ever.
[02:30:39.688 --> 02:30:43.569]  Macron won in a landslide, thanks to many simply voting against Le Pen.
[02:30:43.729 --> 02:30:46.370]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election.
[02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:53.313]  Leaked documents revealed Macron would cater to Islam, Antifa, the EU, as well as his own personal offshore bank accounts.
[02:30:53.493 --> 02:30:55.554]  There will be no investigating into the U.S.
[02:30:55.614 --> 02:31:00.256]  meddling in the French election, despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S.
[02:31:00.316 --> 02:31:04.678]  news network endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist.
[02:31:04.818 --> 02:31:11.902]  The fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist, as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[02:31:11.982 --> 02:31:16.424]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive la France.
[02:31:16.704 --> 02:31:20.809]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate.
[02:31:20.869 --> 02:31:22.271]  They cheer hooray for France.
[02:31:22.511 --> 02:31:23.392]  Long live France!
[02:31:23.652 --> 02:31:30.080]  As this election will likely mark the end of France and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:32.723]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.

[02:33:20.042 --> 02:33:24.724]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.084 --> 02:33:30.085]  The whole transhumanist movement, the whole gender-neutral movement is about saying you can't be man, can't be woman.
[02:33:30.125 --> 02:33:36.268]  That's the old-fashioned bad thing that hurts everybody's feelings on the cover of Newsweek, Time Magazine, National Geographic.
[02:33:36.688 --> 02:33:40.189]  There just can't be anybody that's, quote, normal, because normal's hateful.
[02:33:41.365 --> 02:33:44.107]  So we've gone from being tolerant to, you're not going to be tolerated.
[02:33:44.688 --> 02:33:47.110]  And then, oh, we're merging with a machine, body augmentation.
[02:33:47.130 --> 02:33:49.551]  The CIA and others have met the plan to push this.
[02:33:49.611 --> 02:33:51.713]  Leanne McAdoo is here to discuss this with us.
[02:33:52.394 --> 02:33:54.035]  And of course, you wanted to come on today about this.
[02:33:54.055 --> 02:34:00.040]  I separately saw Mark Dice's video on InfoWars.com where he was showing the MTV Gender Neutral Awards.
[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:01.501]  They don't call you male or female now.
[02:34:01.961 --> 02:34:03.682]  Like best actress or best actor.
[02:34:04.163 --> 02:34:05.884]  Target's getting rid of areas for boys and girls.
[02:34:05.904 --> 02:34:06.485]  It's one area.
[02:34:06.845 --> 02:34:08.846]  I mean, this is massive engineering.
[02:34:09.187 --> 02:34:09.447]  Oh, yes.
[02:34:09.727 --> 02:34:12.793]  So we'll talk to Leanne McAdoo about that here in just a moment.
[02:34:14.198 --> 02:34:15.658]  We don't have George Soros funding.
[02:34:15.678 --> 02:34:17.959]  We don't get government stimulus money like MSNBC.
[02:34:18.899 --> 02:34:20.480]  We don't get funded by the multinationals.
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:23.901]  We get funded by you buying great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:24.461 --> 02:34:35.064]  The best water filtration systems, gravity-fed, wide selections, the great Patriot apparel to then be able to meet like-minded people and also promote freedom out there when you're out and about the town.
[02:34:35.624 --> 02:34:38.525]  Great supplements that the enemy demonizes all over the news.
[02:34:39.145 --> 02:34:41.246]  Oh my gosh, Alex Jones sells snake oil!
[02:34:42.179 --> 02:34:48.562]  Then they cut to commercial and it's a serotonin reuptake inhibitor Prozac ad that literally gives you brain embolisms and death.
[02:34:48.942 --> 02:34:50.023]  You know, all the rest is garbage.
[02:34:50.543 --> 02:34:52.384]  As if BioPQQ's quack.
[02:34:52.764 --> 02:34:56.666]  That's a hundred plus studies behind BioPQQ, one of the ingredients in DNA Force.
[02:34:57.086 --> 02:34:58.067]  By the way, it's about to sell out.
[02:34:59.327 --> 02:34:59.988]  DNA Force.
[02:35:00.068 --> 02:35:05.630]  I mean, BioPQQ's been proven for nerve growth refactor, detoxifying the mitochondria in your cells.
[02:35:06.051 --> 02:35:07.531]  This is a drug in Japan.
[02:35:07.571 --> 02:35:08.912]  We have to buy it from the Japanese.
[02:35:09.392 --> 02:35:10.593]  That's just one of the ingredients in it.
[02:35:11.997 --> 02:35:13.138]  X2, the good halogen.
[02:35:13.178 --> 02:35:14.518]  Look what it's done for so many people.
[02:35:14.898 --> 02:35:16.619]  Super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:35:16.659 --> 02:35:17.980]  Read the rave reviews, folks.
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:19.561]  This is snake oil.
[02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:23.262]  Think about coming out with a multivitamin called snake bite or snake oil or something.
[02:35:23.322 --> 02:35:23.662]  Snake oil.
[02:35:23.682 --> 02:35:25.283]  Because it's got everything in it, you know.
[02:35:25.843 --> 02:35:27.824]  In the old days, heroin was what the snake oil was.
[02:35:27.904 --> 02:35:28.204]  Exactly.
[02:35:28.225 --> 02:35:30.546]  You drank heroin and didn't have any more pain.
[02:35:30.666 --> 02:35:31.786]  Or a cocaine derivative.
[02:35:32.086 --> 02:35:33.627]  Or cocaine or heroin, yeah, would be in it.
[02:35:33.647 --> 02:35:34.788]  No, that's not what we're selling here.
[02:35:35.108 --> 02:35:36.508]  So that's the old, this is just known herbs.
[02:35:36.528 --> 02:35:37.729]  That's a big pharma selling.
[02:35:38.129 --> 02:35:39.910]  Let me just ask you, Lan, what does super female do for you?
[02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:44.334]  Turned me into a goddess like overnight.
[02:35:44.975 --> 02:35:53.366]  Yeah, it really it took a few days for it to kind of really Acclimate in my body and my cells, but yes, I just was like walking down the grocery store aisle like
[02:35:55.769 --> 02:35:57.790]  And by the way, I didn't ever ask you to say that.
[02:35:57.810 --> 02:35:59.090]  You're like, man, this stuff really works.
[02:35:59.430 --> 02:36:00.171]  It really does.
[02:36:00.771 --> 02:36:01.611]  It's concentrated.
[02:36:01.631 --> 02:36:04.012]  It's known herbs concentrated like an oil form.
[02:36:04.752 --> 02:36:06.233]  It's available at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:36:06.253 --> 02:36:07.513]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:36:07.993 --> 02:36:09.474]  We have the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:36:09.514 --> 02:36:11.715]  It's back in super blue with the colloidal silver.
[02:36:11.735 --> 02:36:13.255]  It's what turns a grayish blue.
[02:36:13.835 --> 02:36:16.256]  Real iodine's blue, not red, folks.
[02:36:17.077 --> 02:36:18.717]  And then, of course, it's a blue-purple crystal.
[02:36:18.997 --> 02:36:20.258]  Then, of course, it has the colloidal silver in it.
[02:36:20.298 --> 02:36:23.179]  That is back 33% off and so much more.
[02:36:24.059 --> 02:36:29.200]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:33.461]  Now, Leon McAdoo is here.
[02:36:33.681 --> 02:36:40.002]  Earlier in the broadcast, I began to get into this, but I want to talk about transhumanism, where they're saying, oh, your future is this.
[02:36:40.202 --> 02:36:42.323]  Oh, evolution, you're going to evolve.
[02:36:42.383 --> 02:36:45.703]  But it's the big corporations that are deciding how we're going to evolve.
[02:36:45.723 --> 02:36:48.464]  We see that famous photo of Zuckerberg with all of his minions.
[02:36:49.284 --> 02:36:55.209]  Virtual reality goggles on, sitting like, you know, hunchbacks while he walks bipedally in the real universe.
[02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:57.992]  They're living in his world that he programmed.
[02:36:58.052 --> 02:36:59.233]  That's the holy grail.
[02:36:59.673 --> 02:37:02.216]  What humans will look like in a thousand years we're reviewing.
[02:37:03.686 --> 02:37:14.730]  This piece put out by Inside Tech, put out by Tech Insider, and again it's like it's all fun, it's all great, you'll be put in a big mainframe, it will control you, it will know your future.
[02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:16.651]  This sounds like being in hell, doesn't it?
[02:37:16.891 --> 02:37:24.334]  Well Alex, there's a story out, I think it's on Bloomberg, but it's definitely up on the Drudge Report, where they're already saying, what's the world going to look like without jobs?
[02:37:24.674 --> 02:37:32.297]  Because we know this is going to happen very quickly, there's the automated takeover, we will have hundreds of millions of people out of work.
[02:37:32.757 --> 02:37:34.178]  And so they're saying... Just in phase one.
[02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:34.618]  Right.
[02:37:34.838 --> 02:37:36.259]  So they're saying, well, what's that going to look like?
[02:37:36.319 --> 02:37:39.400]  Well, most people are going to be involved in virtual reality.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:41.221]  Most people are going to play video games all day.
[02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:48.764]  And that's going to make their life in the VR world will be much more exciting than the real world for them because they're, you know...
[02:37:49.284 --> 02:37:50.825]  They're not going to have any meaning to their life.
[02:37:51.165 --> 02:37:53.425]  And then they're this, uh, it's the Guardian.
[02:37:53.725 --> 02:37:59.607]  They go on to talk about how, well, people are already, you know, for thousands of years have been playing in a virtual reality world with religion.
[02:38:00.047 --> 02:38:10.831]  And basically saying religion, like Islam and Christianity, you're, you're getting these imaginary points and you have these imaginary things that you have to do in order to get to the next level, which is heaven.
[02:38:11.771 --> 02:38:19.114]  You know, so they're already kind of selling it as, you know, you're already there, so what's the matter if you just strap on a headset and live in a world of make-believe?
[02:38:20.315 --> 02:38:21.755]  Let's expand on that.
[02:38:21.995 --> 02:38:26.277]  It's their false world they're creating, so that's why they come out and say, reality's already
[02:38:26.357 --> 02:38:27.018]  That's right.
[02:38:45.354 --> 02:39:12.554]  Using our mass movement to do it, so they're creating a real world that's ugly, and where you don't have opportunities, but then saying, in the Gulag archipelago of the Gulag casino model, a term coined by Max Keiser, who we should get back on about this, he said that a decade ago, you will then have to work in their VR and serve in their reality and become conditioned in this false reality simulator to where you accept this and this is how you get credits
[02:39:13.234 --> 02:39:14.415]  By diverting yourself.
[02:39:14.455 --> 02:39:30.708]  That's why in the Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, written 17 years ago, Bill Joyce said, I went to this top globalist meeting, and he said, we decided just to kill everybody, but we're going to divert them with games and let them have fun, so that they lose their humanity, so by the time we finally go ahead and bio-weapon them, they would have already given up their humanity.
[02:39:30.728 --> 02:39:33.830]  The article is Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, Wired Magazine.
[02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:39.334]  Again, put out in 1999, so you might want to go read that for yourself.
[02:39:39.834 --> 02:39:46.979]  This is what they're really building, and I've been warning and warning and warning and warning, and now they're officially going with the dystopic model.
[02:39:49.821 --> 02:40:00.790]  I mean it's very much like the movie The Matrix where we're all just kind of plugged in and they're harnessing our energy because it's not as if we're just gonna be plugged into these virtual reality machines and they just leave us.
[02:40:00.850 --> 02:40:11.680]  I mean we still have to be fed and bathed and things like that so what's gonna happen and eventually are we all gonna be plugged into you know one mainframe where they can just pull the plug?
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:13.122]  And they say that in this piece.
[02:40:13.242 --> 02:40:14.404]  Again, like, oh, it's fun.
[02:40:14.424 --> 02:40:16.107]  Non-threatening little nerd voice.
[02:40:16.147 --> 02:40:16.908]  It's really cool.
[02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:18.150]  This is the future.
[02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:19.111]  It's normal evolution.
[02:40:19.131 --> 02:40:20.373]  They don't say, we've taken control of it.
[02:40:20.393 --> 02:40:20.974]  We're getting rid of you.
[02:40:21.195 --> 02:40:21.575]  And again.
[02:40:22.631 --> 02:40:27.893]  All the metrics show, the vaccines, all of it, lowering our brain cells, lowering our IQ.
[02:40:27.913 --> 02:40:30.514]  People look like zombies out in the general public.
[02:40:30.674 --> 02:40:35.256]  And I don't feel powerful if they all look like hell, and then they all look like they're dead and they're waddling around.
[02:40:35.796 --> 02:40:41.398]  It scares me for my children and humanity to see the very essence being sucked out of people.
[02:40:41.698 --> 02:40:46.420]  But you go to some fishing village in the middle of nowhere, the kids are totally poor, their eyes are totally alive, they're awake.
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:53.965]  But then in Brazil, in places a few years after modern technology comes and farming and GMOs, suddenly their cancer rates way up.
[02:40:54.365 --> 02:40:55.986]  This is killing us by design.
[02:40:56.046 --> 02:40:59.008]  It's being done by design and the globalists admit they're doing it.
[02:40:59.048 --> 02:40:59.909]  So let's critique.
[02:41:00.149 --> 02:41:03.311]  Well Alex, just think about too, we hear all these stories every year.
[02:41:03.651 --> 02:41:11.537]  Many, many stories of people in Asia who are like addicted to these game cafes where they just go and they play games.
[02:41:12.017 --> 02:41:12.697]  I don't know.
[02:41:32.574 --> 02:41:33.856]  It's a total scientific attack.
[02:41:34.657 --> 02:41:35.117]  It really is.
[02:41:35.558 --> 02:41:44.568]  And that's the thing is, our brains, we basically are, you know, these supercomputers where we download this information and then we're able to create it, manifest it.
[02:41:44.909 --> 02:41:49.214]  We're manifesting machines and they know that, so they want to control the images.
[02:41:49.234 --> 02:41:51.657]  So that they can manipulate us to build the thing they want.
[02:41:52.057 --> 02:41:52.557]  Absolutely.
[02:41:53.198 --> 02:42:06.845]  And again, I don't say this, you read top globalist writings, they believe intergalactic beings across some space-time continuum, not even from another dimension, but using interdimensional communication, and our brain is like the fifth, sixth dimension, that's mathematically proven, to communicate with us.
[02:42:07.465 --> 02:42:20.575]  So our brains are so sophisticated that they actually lock into another dimension, especially when we're sleeping, and then they're just programming us with what they want us to build, which is basically, they believe, like some type of intergalactic gate for them to actually get in.
[02:42:20.595 --> 02:42:22.056]  Now, I'm not saying this.
[02:42:22.556 --> 02:42:27.920]  This is what Bill Joy and Ray Kurzweil and the globalists and the UN and all of them believe.
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:36.166]  And you read their writings and then they're actually doing it and creating all these new genetic spliced creatures that are alien, part human, part animal.
[02:42:37.228 --> 02:42:39.590]  Saying they're going to be God, saying the singularity will happen.
[02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:40.691]  It's not in a thousand years.
[02:42:40.711 --> 02:42:42.973]  They believe by 2045 this is here.
[02:42:43.313 --> 02:42:46.996]  They're already putting brain chips in troops so that they're not depressed.
[02:42:47.216 --> 02:42:48.758]  They're already erasing memories in troops.
[02:42:49.118 --> 02:42:51.260]  They already had robot, you know, cats in 1962.
[02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:51.360]  CIA.
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:52.801]  Imagine where we are now.
[02:42:52.821 --> 02:42:53.261]  Exactly.
[02:42:56.704 --> 02:43:12.830]  Well, something you were talking about during the marathon broadcast the other day just kind of made me think, and I know people are already kind of talking about this type of stuff on the internet, but even just getting us ready for a gender neutral society and a society where anyone can be whatever they want.
[02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:15.851]  They can be a fluffy kitten person and that's how they identify.
[02:43:16.191 --> 02:43:19.673]  They're basically preparing us for that Star Trek reality.
[02:43:20.393 --> 02:43:25.556]  Or even Star Wars, where there are all of these other kind of beings out there, and it's just normal.
[02:43:25.856 --> 02:43:26.836]  It's just completely normal.
[02:43:27.196 --> 02:43:33.199]  And the false reality that they're creating, then you see that it works, so you don't even know what's going on in front of your face anymore.
[02:43:33.219 --> 02:43:34.240]  Yeah, nothing's real, right?
[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:35.100]  It's all make-believe.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:40.743]  And that's why there's this new, you were going to get into that if we play this clip, they have the Gender Neutral MTV Awards.
[02:43:41.483 --> 02:43:47.850]  So, I mean, it's just mind-blowing that we've gotten to this point where, again, gender even existing is bad.
[02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:51.453]  They have to get rid of all human identity, all human culture.
[02:43:51.713 --> 02:43:55.117]  Don't go to a Chico de Mayo thing if you're not Mexican.
[02:43:55.357 --> 02:43:56.979]  That's cultural appropriation.
[02:43:57.379 --> 02:43:58.420]  It's ending culture.
[02:43:59.441 --> 02:44:00.562]  And then it's the big enemy.
[02:44:00.782 --> 02:44:03.105]  Let's go ahead and start going to this piece here.
[02:44:03.505 --> 02:44:05.447]  This has got five and a half million views in just two days.
[02:44:05.707 --> 02:44:07.409]  What humans will look like in a thousand years.
[02:44:07.809 --> 02:44:08.590]  Let's play this.
[02:44:08.610 --> 02:44:09.711]  Let's put it in split screen.
[02:44:09.991 --> 02:44:12.834]  And then we'll sit here and analyze this under fair use.
[02:44:12.854 --> 02:44:14.355]  This is put out by Tech Insider.
[02:44:14.596 --> 02:44:16.838]  How wonderful and how great this is.
[02:44:16.858 --> 02:44:18.239]  You just give up your evolution.
[02:44:18.499 --> 02:44:19.640]  Let other people direct it.
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:20.001]  Here it is.
[02:44:20.748 --> 02:44:22.809]  What humans will look like in a thousand years.
[02:44:22.829 --> 02:44:23.369]  They're telling us.
[02:44:23.789 --> 02:44:25.090]  Humans are still evolving.
[02:44:25.470 --> 02:44:27.511]  So where will evolution take us in a thousand years?
[02:44:27.531 --> 02:44:28.871]  They're taking control of our environment.
[02:44:28.911 --> 02:44:29.171]  Yeah.
[02:44:29.371 --> 02:44:31.072]  Because again, now the elites have taken it from us.
[02:44:31.092 --> 02:44:32.433]  We're manifesting machines.
[02:44:32.453 --> 02:44:35.154]  So they can tell us.
[02:44:35.174 --> 02:44:35.794]  Here you go.
[02:44:35.814 --> 02:44:38.315]  In 1880, the average American male was 5 foot 7.
[02:44:38.955 --> 02:44:40.736]  Today, he's 5 foot 10.
[02:44:41.496 --> 02:44:47.218]  We may also merge with machines that can enhance our hearing, eyesight, health, and much more.
[02:44:47.238 --> 02:44:48.199]  So it's all positive.
[02:44:49.099 --> 02:44:51.480]  Sure, so it's all this cool, fun stuff.
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:53.401]  That's the worm on the hook.
[02:44:53.421 --> 02:44:53.542]  Right.
[02:44:53.562 --> 02:44:54.502]  This is the bait.
[02:44:54.522 --> 02:44:56.003]  Let's keep going.
[02:45:18.055 --> 02:45:21.076]  However, it's not just our outside appearance that will change.
[02:45:21.676 --> 02:45:25.617]  Our genes will also evolve on microscopic levels to aid our survival.
[02:45:25.678 --> 02:45:26.398]  It's called cancer.
[02:45:26.438 --> 02:45:32.860]  For example, an Oxford-led study discovered a group of HIV-infected children in South Africa living healthy lives.
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:36.061]  It turns out they have a built-in defense against HIV.
[02:45:36.741 --> 02:45:38.443]  Oh, without any upgrades?
[02:45:38.843 --> 02:45:44.470]  It was always known that it was a bioweapon that mainly targets Africans and that Northern Europeans could almost not get it.
[02:45:44.530 --> 02:45:45.290]  That was done in the 80s.
[02:45:45.591 --> 02:45:49.135]  It was put in hepatitis shots, given to gay men as vectors to spread it.
[02:45:49.655 --> 02:45:52.198]  So again, we know all the human testing, Tuskegee, all of it.
[02:45:52.518 --> 02:45:55.301]  Here they are, oh now we're going to take this DNA
[02:45:55.942 --> 02:45:57.323]  And then splice it into you.
[02:45:57.683 --> 02:46:00.364]  We have the answer for this man-made disease we've given you.
[02:46:00.744 --> 02:46:01.844]  Now let us put something in you.
[02:46:01.884 --> 02:46:06.106]  But just like the smartphones and everything else, it's going to be built in with Trojan horses.
[02:46:06.566 --> 02:46:09.347]  Everything they give you comes at the loss of something else.
[02:46:09.387 --> 02:46:09.727]  Here it is.
[02:46:09.747 --> 02:46:12.388]  Well, also too, this is making the argument that human beings...
[02:46:13.008 --> 02:46:16.289]  Human beings are incredible, and that our bodies are adaptable.
[02:46:16.329 --> 02:46:18.570]  We don't need their machines to fix us incorrectly.
[02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:25.092]  And we know all the machines, the calculators, I'm not a troglodyte, but what they've given us is making us uglier, stupider, more unhealthy.
[02:46:25.132 --> 02:46:25.352]  Right.
[02:46:25.372 --> 02:46:28.033]  So we know everything they've given us has been directed to make us weak.
[02:46:28.353 --> 02:46:29.954]  Everything they do is to make us subservient.
[02:46:30.194 --> 02:46:36.696]  I watch adults just walk around all helpless, and if you act helpless, other people are nice to you, like, oh, you're helpless, you're a super beta too.
[02:46:36.916 --> 02:46:37.816]  Here, let's all be helpless.
[02:46:38.057 --> 02:46:39.137]  Here, let's go back to it.
[02:46:39.577 --> 02:46:45.980]  For example, an Oxford-led study discovered a group of HIV-infected children in South Africa living healthy lives.
[02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:51.983]  It turns out they have a built-in defense against HIV that prevents the virus from advancing to AIDS.
[02:46:52.003 --> 02:46:52.863]  Hit pause again.
[02:46:53.184 --> 02:46:56.005]  Yeah, it's called T-lymphocytes, which the HIV targets, but let's continue.
[02:46:56.793 --> 02:47:15.666]  ...editing tools like CRISPR, we may eventually control our genes and DNA to the point where... ...CRISPR is run on the Cold Springs Harbor Lab, the Human Genome Project at Cold Springs Harbor, where eugenics came that set up Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, but you're not supposed to know any of that, or the guy that ran it a few years ago had to resign because he said blacks weren't human.
[02:47:16.046 --> 02:47:25.712]  So people saying blacks aren't human are running it, but don't worry, they want to manipulate your DNA with a synthetic system of the CRISPR that's already mapping it, and believe me, this is 30-year-old technology.
[02:47:25.913 --> 02:47:26.433]  Let's continue.
[02:47:26.813 --> 02:47:29.876]  ...immune to disease and even reverse the effects of aging.
[02:47:30.697 --> 02:47:35.841]  Another way to jumpstart the human evolution on a different path is to move some of us to Mars.
[02:47:36.522 --> 02:47:44.910]  Mars receives 66% less sunlight than Earth, which can mean humans on Mars will evolve larger pupils that can absorb more light in order to see.
[02:47:45.690 --> 02:47:53.516]  And since Mars' gravitational pull is only 38% of Earth's, people born on Mars might actually be taller than anyone on Earth.
[02:47:54.156 --> 02:48:07.205]  In space, the fluid that separates our vertebrae expands, which led American aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin to suggest that Mars' low gravity could allow the human spine to elongate enough to add a few extra inches to our height.
[02:48:08.065 --> 02:48:09.647]  However, not even a move to Mars.
[02:48:09.927 --> 02:48:12.148]  Everybody wants to be taller, so they do surveys.
[02:48:12.168 --> 02:48:14.530]  They want to be taller, they want better sight, they want to live longer.
[02:48:14.770 --> 02:48:16.791]  You'll be taller, you'll be sexy, you'll be cool.
[02:48:16.931 --> 02:48:18.232]  Take the chips, take the chips.
[02:48:18.272 --> 02:48:18.792]  Let's keep going.
[02:48:19.152 --> 02:48:24.315]  This could spark the biggest change in human evolution that we may have coming for the next thousand years.
[02:48:24.956 --> 02:48:25.636]  Immortality.
[02:48:26.276 --> 02:48:31.059]  The path to immortality will likely require humans to download their consciousness into a machine.
[02:48:31.819 --> 02:48:40.044]  Right now, scientists in Italy and China are performing head transplants on animals to determine if you can transfer consciousness from one body to another.
[02:48:40.704 --> 02:48:43.226]  They claim their next big step... Oh, medical experiments are so fun.
[02:48:43.926 --> 02:48:44.867]  This has been going on a while.
[02:49:08.959 --> 02:49:13.142]  They come out and say we need to control all carbon, control all humans, because climate change.
[02:49:13.182 --> 02:49:15.283]  First it was freezing, then warming, saying we did it.
[02:49:15.664 --> 02:49:19.967]  Now they say, oh, just change we did, we've got to stop all change and tax carbon.
[02:49:20.407 --> 02:49:24.390]  So the overall message here is, we're going to control human development.
[02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:27.591]  Well, of course, millions of us aren't going to make it to Mars.
[02:49:28.011 --> 02:49:28.791]  Hundreds of millions.
[02:49:29.011 --> 02:49:32.472]  So who are going to be these lucky few that get to go colonate Mars?
[02:49:32.532 --> 02:49:37.294]  I mean, it's like, we already know their plans to wipe out the majority of the world.
[02:49:37.334 --> 02:49:40.095]  They're just telling us that all the robots replacing you is fun.
[02:49:40.355 --> 02:49:41.075]  Take the vaccine.
[02:49:41.115 --> 02:49:42.555]  I know you're having trouble breathing now.
[02:49:42.935 --> 02:49:44.236]  Let us give the newborn baby shots.
[02:49:44.316 --> 02:49:45.116]  Oh, another one died.
[02:49:45.296 --> 02:49:45.896]  Oh, liberal.
[02:49:46.096 --> 02:49:46.216]  Oh.
[02:49:46.557 --> 02:49:47.737]  I mean, this is just their whole deal.
[02:49:48.217 --> 02:49:48.437]  Right.
[02:49:48.737 --> 02:49:51.998]  It's, and I don't, you know, I as well, I'm not a troglodyte.
[02:49:52.138 --> 02:49:53.039]  You're so oliberal.
[02:49:53.299 --> 02:49:57.220]  I'm not anti-technology.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.162]  He's doing me.
[02:50:02.202 --> 02:50:03.682]  I gotta break my crescent.
[02:50:04.203 --> 02:50:05.643]  Thank you New World Order.
[02:50:05.703 --> 02:50:07.244]  I'm like 5 inches tall.
[02:50:08.143 --> 02:50:10.784]  We're about to kill you for the earth, but your brain will be transferred to this computer.
[02:50:11.024 --> 02:50:12.185]  Look, they're all happy in there.
[02:50:12.225 --> 02:50:14.666]  Don't even tell them, it's totally false.
[02:50:14.726 --> 02:50:18.708]  Well, that's the thing, it's like... They trust us at Facebook, what dumb effers.
[02:50:19.608 --> 02:50:21.389]  Sorry.
[02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:28.072]  Why are people so afraid of dying and going on to the next... I mean, it's like, we all die, and so they... Well, they're trying to be God.
[02:50:28.092 --> 02:50:30.914]  They say God doesn't exist, but we're creating a machine.
[02:50:31.434 --> 02:50:35.116]  We'll trap you forever inside of our supercomputers and harness your consciousness.
[02:50:35.896 --> 02:50:36.577]  Sounds like hell.
[02:50:36.817 --> 02:50:37.978]  Exactly!
[02:50:38.478 --> 02:50:39.599]  Where you never die.
[02:50:39.799 --> 02:50:41.240]  In a freaking computer.
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:41.661]  So great.
[02:50:41.681 --> 02:50:43.042]  I get to live in a Sim Tower?
[02:50:43.082 --> 02:50:43.722]  It won't even be that.
[02:50:43.742 --> 02:50:45.864]  It'll be a bunch of... It'll be like an imprint.
[02:50:45.884 --> 02:50:48.206]  It'll be like the photo of a giraffe, not the giraffe.
[02:50:48.346 --> 02:50:48.526]  Right.
[02:50:48.666 --> 02:50:49.287]  They'll say, look!
[02:50:49.547 --> 02:50:50.188]  They're all in there.
[02:50:50.208 --> 02:50:51.008]  They're alive!
[02:50:51.389 --> 02:50:53.490]  And it'll be a bunch of stuff cataloged and what you said and stuff.
[02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:54.671]  Like Siri or something.
[02:50:54.691 --> 02:50:55.632]  I'm like, why do we have a toilet?
[02:50:55.652 --> 02:50:56.012]  That's all it is.
[02:50:56.052 --> 02:50:57.994]  It's all a load of manure!
[02:50:58.614 --> 02:51:01.577]  We shall return on the other side with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:51:03.362 --> 02:51:07.205]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:07.245 --> 02:51:09.106]  We are under constant attack.
[02:51:09.586 --> 02:51:11.787]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[02:51:11.988 --> 02:51:14.889]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[02:51:14.929 --> 02:51:29.238]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[02:51:29.938 --> 02:51:31.559]  They can't get to us that way.
[02:51:31.939 --> 02:51:34.760]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:35.760]  They don't have that power.
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:38.761]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[02:51:39.121 --> 02:51:41.522]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:51:41.962 --> 02:51:44.803]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:44.823 --> 02:51:46.464]  This is by listener request.
[02:51:46.704 --> 02:51:51.946]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[02:51:51.966 --> 02:51:52.546]  Again,
[02:51:53.286 --> 02:51:59.029]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[02:51:59.449 --> 02:52:03.750]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[02:52:04.351 --> 02:52:08.733]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[02:52:10.233 --> 02:52:12.956]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[02:52:12.976 --> 02:52:31.373]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at infowarsstore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[02:52:31.713 --> 02:52:34.535]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[02:52:34.575 --> 02:52:36.597]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[02:52:36.957 --> 02:52:38.958]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[02:52:39.399 --> 02:52:51.027]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[02:52:51.047 --> 02:52:54.870]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:53:03.686 --> 02:53:05.306]  You think our information's hardcore?
[02:53:05.686 --> 02:53:06.927]  You think our focus is brutal?
[02:53:07.167 --> 02:53:08.707]  Try our nutraceuticals.
[02:53:08.987 --> 02:53:09.787]  Try our supplements.
[02:53:10.047 --> 02:53:12.708]  We've taken BrainForce and made it BrainForce Plus.
[02:53:12.908 --> 02:53:16.688]  Now at 20% more in the bottle and an even more hardcore formula.
[02:53:17.108 --> 02:53:19.469]  You owe it to yourself to get these products.
[02:53:19.529 --> 02:53:21.989]  They really have worked for myself, my family.
[02:53:22.029 --> 02:53:24.169]  They have five-star reviews by the thousands.
[02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:28.310]  Secure your BrainForce Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:28.330 --> 02:53:28.630]  Now 20% stronger.
[02:53:28.650 --> 02:53:29.730]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:33.531 --> 02:53:36.193]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see I told you so.
[02:53:36.413 --> 02:53:39.475]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[02:53:39.815 --> 02:53:40.555]  Because it's already here.
[02:53:40.936 --> 02:53:41.596]  It's being announced.
[02:53:41.956 --> 02:53:45.438]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[02:53:45.838 --> 02:53:47.799]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:49.460]  A new battleship in the fight.
[02:53:49.641 --> 02:53:50.641]  InfoWars Live.
[02:53:50.821 --> 02:53:51.662]  Available right now.
[02:53:51.922 --> 02:53:53.703]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[02:53:53.723 --> 02:53:56.124]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[02:53:56.805 --> 02:53:57.725]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[02:53:58.286 --> 02:54:01.287]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[02:54:01.788 --> 02:54:02.368]  Take action!
[02:54:11.823 --> 02:54:13.984]  All right, Leanne McAdoo in studio with us.
[02:54:14.004 --> 02:54:16.306]  I'm going to do five minutes to the next hour.
[02:54:16.346 --> 02:54:17.947]  And then who's doing the fourth hour today?
[02:54:17.967 --> 02:54:18.908]  I believe it's David Knight.
[02:54:18.928 --> 02:54:20.849]  David Knight, he's got a special guest I know joining him.
[02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:22.090]  I got to a lot of news.
[02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:23.130]  I didn't get to a lot of news.
[02:54:23.891 --> 02:54:29.755]  But Leanne, you've got a stack of news here where now, oh, we don't have male and female awards at the MTV.
[02:54:29.775 --> 02:54:30.655]  We just have awards.
[02:54:31.095 --> 02:54:33.097]  And again, they're getting rid of the boys and girls sections.
[02:54:33.137 --> 02:54:37.159]  This is an assault on the gender, on children, on life.
[02:54:37.419 --> 02:54:39.281]  What better way to get you to stop having children
[02:54:39.901 --> 02:54:47.443]  Bill Nye the Science Guy has re-edited his shows, where you don't even have to think about chromosomes and XY and XX.
[02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:51.265]  I mean, they mean business, folks, and they chemically manipulate the water and the food.
[02:54:51.285 --> 02:54:56.166]  Then they say, oh, you're anti-gay or anti-trans when they're artificially doing it.
[02:54:56.346 --> 02:54:57.707]  Who can deny it's a total rollout?
[02:54:57.967 --> 02:55:00.688]  Who can deny it's like an alien attack on the species?
[02:55:00.868 --> 02:55:04.869]  It's like a science fiction book where aliens come and they teach you it's cool not to reproduce.
[02:55:05.569 --> 02:55:05.789]  Yeah.
[02:55:05.849 --> 02:55:06.750]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:55:06.910 --> 02:55:21.136]  Well, and I get the whole gender spectrum thing, but they never want to talk about why, you know, why that might happen, why a child washed in its mother's womb might have a certain amount of estrogen or testosterone and why it's all kind of jacked up these days.
[02:55:21.336 --> 02:55:24.798]  They don't ever want to talk about the root cause of why that potentially
[02:55:25.698 --> 02:55:32.561]  Why a young boy could be washed with less testosterone in the womb so he has more effeminate... And that's in all the studies.
[02:55:32.601 --> 02:55:33.522]  That's incontrovertible.
[02:55:33.642 --> 02:55:40.165]  And that's like natural, but are they looking at why moms, are they on pharmaceutical drugs while they're pregnant?
[02:55:40.625 --> 02:55:42.246]  I'm sure there's a lot of that going on.
[02:55:42.646 --> 02:55:47.008]  Or are we getting tons of estrogen blasted at us or estrogen mimickers?
[02:55:47.748 --> 02:55:49.529]  So they don't ever want to talk about that kind of stuff.
[02:55:49.549 --> 02:55:50.710]  So it's like, I don't want to...
[02:55:52.004 --> 02:55:53.045]  And then they say, go with it.
[02:55:53.525 --> 02:55:53.705]  Yeah.
[02:55:53.725 --> 02:56:06.552]  I mean, people went and looked into the gay frog thing and found it's in thousands of big studies that frogs are going extinct all over because just atrazine in the water at like, you know, one parts per whatever is turning the frogs gay.
[02:56:06.693 --> 02:56:08.053]  And they make a joke about it.
[02:56:08.474 --> 02:56:09.534]  No, the frogs are dead.
[02:56:09.554 --> 02:56:10.115]  Right.
[02:56:10.555 --> 02:56:12.376]  They're like, oh, you're against gay people.
[02:56:12.676 --> 02:56:14.117]  They're doing it on purpose.
[02:56:14.577 --> 02:56:19.959]  Well, and that's why I don't like to just flat out demonize and point fingers at you, you, you.
[02:56:19.999 --> 02:56:24.140]  I don't like to do that because there is an assault on the human race.
[02:56:24.220 --> 02:56:28.382]  And we know, especially here in the West, we've been a science experiment.
[02:56:28.782 --> 02:56:36.084]  No one else gets these GMO foods and bombarded with all the plastics and things in their foods because we're so civilized.
[02:56:36.104 --> 02:56:36.664]  We're the West.
[02:56:36.744 --> 02:56:38.145]  We don't even eat real food.
[02:56:38.925 --> 02:56:43.506]  Food for robots, basically, because essentially we are a science experiment.
[02:56:43.827 --> 02:56:53.190]  But what we can see with the social programming going on with the young kids, I have officially turned into one of those crotchety old people who gets... I just, I can't stand the youngins these days.
[02:56:53.250 --> 02:56:57.711]  It's pedophilia to target children and sexualize them, even if you claim it's liberal.
[02:56:57.731 --> 02:56:58.431]  And that's really what it is.
[02:56:58.691 --> 02:57:00.272]  It's the whole UN NAMBLA agenda.
[02:57:00.714 --> 02:57:01.876]  Well, very interesting.
[02:57:01.916 --> 02:57:14.892]  So we've been reporting about how Miley Cyrus just went super crazy and she was being really scandalous and like her last tour she had she was wearing all these like prosthetic sexual organs and gyrating on stage.
[02:57:15.393 --> 02:57:16.154]  Well now she's
[02:57:16.514 --> 02:57:22.597]  Come around and said, you know what, maybe wearing those nipple pasties wasn't the best way to get out the vote for Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:23.017 --> 02:57:24.338]  So she's changing her tune.
[02:57:24.378 --> 02:57:26.799]  She's going to be back to normal good girl again.
[02:57:26.999 --> 02:57:30.581]  But it's all a setup because what it is, is about targeting the youth.
[02:57:30.981 --> 02:57:33.502]  And now she wants to go say, oh, I'm normal again, guys.
[02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:34.342]  You can trust my opinion.
[02:57:34.362 --> 02:57:37.664]  She wants to suck the parents back in to pimp and chump your kids again.
[02:57:37.884 --> 02:57:40.827]  Exactly, and that's what's going on at the MTV Awards.
[02:57:40.867 --> 02:57:43.950]  We had Maxine Waters, okay, 78 year old.
[02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:48.875]  She's been in Congress for a quarter century longer than most of the MTV viewing audience.
[02:57:49.355 --> 02:57:52.118]  She comes out to give the award.
[02:57:52.479 --> 02:57:53.600]  She got a standing ovation.
[02:57:53.820 --> 02:57:55.742]  I'm sure none of these kids even know who she is.
[02:57:55.922 --> 02:57:59.125]  And by the way, she's like, her district sucks.
[02:57:59.285 --> 02:58:01.387]  So what has she actually done for her people?
[02:58:02.288 --> 02:58:07.590]  Um, but she went to present the award for the best fight against the system.
[02:58:08.190 --> 02:58:09.010]  This is a new category.
[02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:10.550]  As if she's not the establishment.
[02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:12.151]  It's Establishment Hollywood.
[02:58:12.171 --> 02:58:13.431]  I think 11 terms.
[02:58:13.551 --> 02:58:14.872]  Claiming they're the resistance.
[02:58:14.912 --> 02:58:15.332]  They are.
[02:58:15.852 --> 02:58:19.593]  Against humans, against life, against America, against freedom.
[02:58:20.073 --> 02:58:25.214]  They are literally a demonic, satanic force of mad scientists.
[02:58:25.595 --> 02:58:26.075]  Hellbent.
[02:58:26.615 --> 02:58:26.895]  Look at this.
[02:58:28.362 --> 02:58:33.425]  For a year or so, the FBI's taking control of the biggest pedophile site in the world called Playpen.
[02:58:33.865 --> 02:58:38.507]  F. And now they've got 1,500 child porn and pedophiles caught in their sites.
[02:58:38.888 --> 02:58:39.708]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:40.548 --> 02:58:40.909]  Right back.
[02:58:40.929 --> 02:58:43.210]  We'll do five more minutes and then David Knight's coming in.
[02:58:43.230 --> 02:58:43.990]  Tell everybody to tune in.
[02:58:44.370 --> 02:58:45.971]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:46.231 --> 02:58:47.552]  Don't let them stop the transmission.
[02:58:47.572 --> 02:58:48.312]  You're unstoppable.
[02:58:53.086 --> 02:59:01.117]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and Liberals is sheerly maddening.
[02:59:01.277 --> 02:59:10.330]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention, the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage at the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[02:59:10.350 --> 02:59:14.754]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[02:59:32.108 --> 02:59:40.774]  But now The Hill has published a story, the 43 people who might run against Trump, which includes the worst of the Democrat Party, and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[02:59:40.854 --> 02:59:46.739]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus act fit of berserking.
[02:59:46.839 --> 02:59:51.122]  I'm Owen Schroer, and for InfoWars.com, the Trump effect has been huge.
[02:59:54.304 --> 03:00:00.189]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.024 --> 03:00:07.005]  The threat is real.
[03:00:07.085 --> 03:00:11.548]  A scientific technocracy calling in world government, allied with radical Islam.
[03:00:12.488 --> 03:00:16.351]  The forces are now attacking any sovereign nation that there stands against it.
[03:00:16.371 --> 03:00:17.452]  This is the front line.
[03:00:19.653 --> 03:00:20.954]  And you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.717 --> 03:00:26.778]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:27.338 --> 03:00:32.382]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:35.543 --> 03:00:39.004]  David Knight is all geared up with a ton of research to come in here.
[03:00:39.024 --> 03:00:41.045]  But knock them dead.
[03:00:41.625 --> 03:00:42.446]  LeeAnn McAdoo.
[03:00:44.547 --> 03:00:49.529]  You, I'd call you a libertarian, but a real progressive when I first met you four and a half years ago.
[03:00:49.549 --> 03:00:53.970]  And it's been quite a journey for you because they've become so much more out in the open.
[03:00:54.611 --> 03:00:55.111]  I used to
[03:00:56.331 --> 03:00:57.552]  Not even really criticize Islam.
[03:00:57.592 --> 03:00:59.134]  I didn't used to get into this whole tranny thing.
[03:00:59.174 --> 03:01:00.656]  I just thought it was some liberal obsession.
[03:01:01.036 --> 03:01:05.541]  Now I can see how it hooks into the transhumanism, all this screwing up little kids, targeting them.
[03:01:05.581 --> 03:01:06.942]  I mean, this is so creepy.
[03:01:07.543 --> 03:01:09.625]  And as you said, you just can't handle it anymore.
[03:01:09.645 --> 03:01:10.886]  It's so clear.
[03:01:10.946 --> 03:01:11.867]  It's so anti-human.
[03:01:12.147 --> 03:01:13.308]  Not the trannies themselves.
[03:01:13.329 --> 03:01:16.672]  That's just one part of this overall confusion they're involved in.
[03:01:17.152 --> 03:01:33.862]  Yeah well I mean even you know I just noticed how tired I am a lot and it's like it's like constant triggering and it's like an assault on our adrenal glands and most people don't even realize they have adrenal fatigue and they can't deal with the day-to-day because we're constantly in that fight-or-flight
[03:01:34.582 --> 03:01:38.023]  And the good news is, we're starting to defeat them is why they're trying to censor us.
[03:01:38.043 --> 03:01:42.384]  Humanity has defeated, whether you like Trump or not, that was an overthrow of the establishment.
[03:01:42.404 --> 03:01:43.245]  They tried to beat him.
[03:01:58.890 --> 03:02:07.076]  Right, and that's why we're seeing them pushing back so hard against this awakening, but why they are targeting the young people.
[03:02:07.116 --> 03:02:13.300]  For instance, the Democrats, their new big thing is they keep dropping F-bombs at all of their town halls and all of their events.
[03:02:13.341 --> 03:02:13.881]  Like that's cool!
[03:02:13.901 --> 03:02:14.621]  We're so cool!
[03:02:14.662 --> 03:02:15.242]  We cuss!
[03:02:15.322 --> 03:02:16.563]  Kids, we're just like you!
[03:02:17.684 --> 03:02:19.625]  Maxine Waters, my millennials!
[03:02:19.825 --> 03:02:20.606]  Stay woke!
[03:02:20.766 --> 03:02:25.690]  You know, it's just, that's their new thing is they want to act like they're the cool kids, you know, we're the ones that
[03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:29.511]  They're super twisted, old globalists, absolutely creepy.
[03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:33.072]  Perfect example of the hypocrisy that we're constantly having to point out.
[03:02:33.132 --> 03:02:39.614]  Samantha Bee, who loves to, you know, poke fun at you as well, Alex, she's this Trump resister.
[03:02:40.314 --> 03:02:46.755]  Well, it turns out her husband is like very vocally opposed to more integration in their local public school.
[03:02:46.815 --> 03:02:52.017]  So it's all these wealthy, rich people there on the Upper West Side, and now
[03:02:52.857 --> 03:02:53.057]  I think.
[03:03:15.871 --> 03:03:16.852]  This is out of Breitbart.
[03:03:17.432 --> 03:03:23.377]  And so, you know, they're the ones constantly calling everyone racist, xenophobic, how dare you let the refugees in.
[03:03:23.397 --> 03:03:26.519]  I never heard racist talk until I got around Democrats and Liberals.
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:29.081]  And they'll like secretly close the door and start saying racist stuff.
[03:03:29.101 --> 03:03:31.043]  I'm like, dude, I'm not into that.
[03:03:31.143 --> 03:03:31.303]  Right.
[03:03:31.503 --> 03:03:34.426]  Well, and then her husband has the audacity to come out and say,
[03:03:35.346 --> 03:03:41.474]  Um, opposition should not be interpreted as racist just because we don't want our school to move over.
[03:03:41.514 --> 03:03:47.802]  I do not want any black people around me, or Hispanics, but I want you to pay for everyone's free babies.
[03:03:47.982 --> 03:03:52.408]  To portray any opposition as classist or racist is as bad as it can get.
[03:03:52.848 --> 03:03:59.755]  That's all your wife does on her show all day long is try to say anything that any Republican does is racist or classist.
[03:04:00.056 --> 03:04:06.923]  But then when you point out that that's exactly what they themselves are guilty of, he says, stop talking to the media.
[03:04:06.963 --> 03:04:10.606]  There'd be no story if you just wouldn't talk to them about the opposition.
[03:04:10.667 --> 03:04:11.307]  Very well done.
[03:04:11.367 --> 03:04:12.649]  And expanding on that, Leigh Ann.
[03:04:13.911 --> 03:04:17.275]  They know full well they're not going to be around all this class war they're creating.
[03:04:17.335 --> 03:04:17.875]  Exactly.
[03:04:17.995 --> 03:04:21.659]  And we're getting rid of the establishment Republicans that are weird, blue-blood elitists.
[03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:25.563]  But the Freedom Caucus is actually trying to make everybody wealthy and independent and free.
[03:04:25.703 --> 03:04:28.426]  That's what is true anti-racism.
[03:04:30.959 --> 03:04:36.467]  But they want to distort everything and keep these young kids divided.
[03:04:36.487 --> 03:04:37.208]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:37.248 --> 03:04:45.980]  They want them desperate where they never get in relationships, they never get around men or women, they get real insecure, they can be told, oh, you don't have any sex, and here's a bunch of other bots that have no sex.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:49.142]  And then now here we all do, you know, really bizarre stuff together.
[03:04:49.542 --> 03:04:58.927]  So what you're getting into is a bunch of perverts that are betas that have actually created a new super pervert beta command base to try to then recruit all our kids for their pedophile operation.
[03:04:58.947 --> 03:05:00.888]  Because super betas are pedophiles, folks.
[03:05:12.378 --> 03:05:20.301]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:20.341 --> 03:05:22.302]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[03:05:23.062 --> 03:05:29.965]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[03:05:30.565 --> 03:05:36.348]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:47.015]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[03:05:47.035 --> 03:05:49.156]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:05:49.176 --> 03:05:53.759]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[03:05:54.159 --> 03:06:00.065]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[03:06:00.385 --> 03:06:09.374]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:06:10.234 --> 03:06:11.355]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:06:11.696 --> 03:06:12.657]  We refuse to do that.
[03:06:13.037 --> 03:06:15.700]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:06:15.780 --> 03:06:17.721]  We're producing something we want to take.
[03:06:17.802 --> 03:06:18.202]  Exactly.
[03:06:18.582 --> 03:06:19.623]  We're looking for the best.
[03:06:19.683 --> 03:06:24.545]  We went out and searched for the best to Private Label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[03:06:24.745 --> 03:06:28.407]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[03:06:28.427 --> 03:06:34.410]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[03:06:34.690 --> 03:06:35.891]  It's everywhere.
[03:06:36.091 --> 03:06:36.751]  It's in nature.
[03:06:36.811 --> 03:06:38.952]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[03:06:39.292 --> 03:06:45.335]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[03:06:46.496 --> 03:06:51.760]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:52.440]  This is insane.
[03:06:52.461 --> 03:07:01.607]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[03:07:01.647 --> 03:07:02.528]  People will buy more of it.
[03:07:02.648 --> 03:07:03.229]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[03:07:03.329 --> 03:07:03.789]  Okay.
[03:07:04.229 --> 03:07:05.110]  Compare that to this.
[03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:06.711]  This is a $50 product.
[03:07:06.731 --> 03:07:10.254]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[03:07:10.274 --> 03:07:10.494]  Okay.
[03:07:10.514 --> 03:07:10.814]  We have 10,000.
[03:07:10.874 --> 03:07:11.815]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[03:07:14.377 --> 03:07:16.238]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[03:07:16.658 --> 03:07:21.902]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[03:07:21.922 --> 03:07:25.804]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[03:07:26.205 --> 03:07:34.930]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[03:07:35.010 --> 03:07:36.091]  It's changed my life.
[03:07:36.191 --> 03:07:38.432]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[03:07:38.773 --> 03:07:40.634]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[03:07:41.034 --> 03:07:43.376]  I was jogging, lifting weights, I couldn't lose the weight.
[03:07:44.276 --> 03:07:51.370]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us and it's changed my life and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:52.512]  It's a win-win.
[03:07:52.993 --> 03:07:53.774]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:15.998 --> 03:08:16.739]  Big Brother.
[03:08:17.139 --> 03:08:18.400]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:20.001]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:20.842 --> 03:08:22.263]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:22.523 --> 03:08:23.684]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:24.184 --> 03:08:28.708]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.796 --> 03:08:34.097]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:34.197 --> 03:08:35.877]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:08:36.497 --> 03:08:37.778]  We have a lot of breaking news.
[03:08:37.818 --> 03:08:45.161]  Of course, we've had Governor Abbott here in Texas assign a law that will not allow sanctuary for criminal sheriffs.
[03:08:46.121 --> 03:08:51.463]  And it began really here in Austin with our sheriff who just got re-elected, Sally Hernandez.
[03:08:51.523 --> 03:08:52.764]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[03:08:52.804 --> 03:09:00.026]  We'll also talk about, at the bottom of the hour, we're going to talk to author George Neumeier, who has written a book called The Political Pope.
[03:09:00.086 --> 03:09:01.127]  I thought it would be interesting
[03:09:01.727 --> 03:09:13.288]  To talk about the back and forth within the Catholic Church about the Pope's politics and how active he is in politics as we see all this discussion about the Johnson Amendment.
[03:09:14.121 --> 03:09:15.082]  You know, it's kind of interesting.
[03:09:15.142 --> 03:09:22.608]  Nobody is saying that the Catholic Church ought to lose any tax deductions because of the Pope's political activism.
[03:09:23.288 --> 03:09:29.813]  But there are people within Protestant churches as well who are saying, well, maybe we don't want to have that kind of discussion in these churches.
[03:09:29.873 --> 03:09:35.738]  I think that the churches ought to be able to have their own discussion as to make their own decision as we're not going to be political or not.
[03:09:35.778 --> 03:09:37.199]  Anyway, we're going to talk to him at the bottom of the hour.
[03:09:37.679 --> 03:09:47.325]  We're going to put a perspective on this on the Catholic side, and of course, as the Protestant side is talking a great deal about the Johnson Amendment, it provides an interesting context for that.
[03:09:48.025 --> 03:09:55.730]  Before I get to that, I just want to say real quickly, thank you so much for all your support that you've given us over the last week, especially through the 30-hour broadcast that we did.
[03:09:55.830 --> 03:10:02.334]  And a reminder that we do have Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, one of my two favorite supplements that's now back in stock, $9.95, 33% off retail.
[03:10:02.374 --> 03:10:04.335]  You know, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[03:10:06.917 --> 03:10:14.325]  That would basically make everything so simple for our operation here because we would know what is coming down the line.
[03:10:14.365 --> 03:10:15.627]  We would know what demand is going to be.
[03:10:15.667 --> 03:10:20.012]  We wouldn't be running in and out of some of the more popular products so quickly.
[03:10:20.953 --> 03:10:22.735]  So just consider AutoShip.
[03:10:23.115 --> 03:10:24.515]  You get a 10% discount.
[03:10:24.555 --> 03:10:29.056]  If you sign up for more than $50 at a time on AutoShip, you get free shipping as well.
[03:10:29.476 --> 03:10:30.516]  So, think about that.
[03:10:30.576 --> 03:10:34.417]  That helps to make sure that you never run out of the supplements that you want on a daily basis.
[03:10:34.457 --> 03:10:41.679]  And I guarantee you, if you try this toothpaste, you're going to want to have that as your toothpaste.
[03:10:41.719 --> 03:10:43.659]  Because I have tried a lot of different toothpastes.
[03:10:44.159 --> 03:10:46.419]  I've tried a lot of different fluoride-free toothpastes.
[03:10:46.579 --> 03:10:48.920]  And I haven't found anything with fluoride or without.
[03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:52.165]  That leaves my mouth feeling as fresh as this does.
[03:10:52.185 --> 03:10:55.071]  How many toothpastes are you going to get with nano silver in it?
[03:10:55.734 --> 03:11:03.882]  Alright, now I want to go and of course you can find all that at InfowarsStore.com and that is 33% off retail right now and of course you can also sign up for AutoShip.
[03:11:04.002 --> 03:11:06.925]  Let's talk about what's going on here in Texas with the Governor's Bill.
[03:11:07.345 --> 03:11:19.978]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott said today that law enforcement and other officials implementing sanctuary policies that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will be now subject to the stiffest penalties in America.
[03:11:21.218 --> 03:11:27.965]  And we have to understand, right here in Travis County, this is really where it's come to a head.
[03:11:28.065 --> 03:11:35.413]  I attended a meeting of the, I guess it was, let's see, what was the organization they had?
[03:11:35.453 --> 03:11:44.082]  It was an initiative that was started by George Bush, where they would tell the immigration officials if they had criminals that they had arrested.
[03:11:45.023 --> 03:11:56.412]  And there was a Democrat sheriff at the time, a black man, and he was getting ripped apart by the Democrat party because he was turning over criminals to immigration.
[03:11:56.992 --> 03:11:59.054]  And we've seen the same thing happen in California.
[03:11:59.614 --> 03:12:07.800]  As soon as Trump was elected, we had all these amnesty groups that were saying, we need to hide these lists of gang members.
[03:12:08.826 --> 03:12:21.194]  from Donald Trump because he would deport them and because he might get somebody who wasn't a gang member who was actually put on that list by mistake so we want to hide and protect even the gang members so that we don't have somebody
[03:12:22.165 --> 03:12:28.770]  Deported by accident who just happens to be only a foreign citizen who is criminally trespassing in the United States.
[03:12:28.810 --> 03:12:29.731]  That's their only crime.
[03:12:29.791 --> 03:12:31.972]  So let's not deport those people.
[03:12:32.012 --> 03:12:39.478]  Let's leave them here and let's even leave known gang members here because we know that that's what Donald Trump wants to do is to deport them.
[03:12:40.458 --> 03:12:43.639]  And of course, what we have here in Texas, I think, is very needed.
[03:12:43.679 --> 03:12:44.700]  There's been a lot of pushback.
[03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:54.103]  We've had Democrat legislators as well as the news media here in Texas pushing back against this, characterizing it as something that is not going to fly, that's not legal.
[03:12:54.163 --> 03:12:57.144]  And of course, Dallas Morning News is right at the center of that.
[03:12:57.624 --> 03:13:07.167]  A Democrat state representative said that this law is unconstitutional because states are preempted by federal law in the area of immigration and are not permitted to conduct their own investigation.
[03:13:07.367 --> 03:13:08.308]  That's not what they're doing.
[03:13:09.056 --> 03:13:20.868]  What they're doing is inquiring about their immigration status and turning them over to the federal officials, the people at the meeting that I went to here in Travis County before this black sheriff was defeated.
[03:13:20.888 --> 03:13:24.752]  I don't know if he was defeated or if he just decided that he wasn't going to run for re-election because he wasn't going to make it.
[03:13:25.713 --> 03:13:30.758]  And this is the first term of Sally Hernandez, the woman who replaced him.
[03:13:31.903 --> 03:13:32.664]  Of course a Democrat.
[03:13:33.105 --> 03:13:41.358]  But when I was at that meeting, they were just incensed that anyone who had committed any crime of any nature would be ever turned over to immigration authorities.
[03:13:41.458 --> 03:13:42.179]  They'd be reported.
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:43.241]  Be investigated.
[03:13:44.404 --> 03:13:46.346]  And Governor Abbott addressed this.
[03:13:46.506 --> 03:13:56.277]  He told Breitbart Texas, this is their article here, that the Dallas Morning News directly misstated what the legal status of the law was out of the U.S.
[03:13:56.297 --> 03:13:58.619]  Supreme Court in the Arizona decision.
[03:13:58.659 --> 03:14:04.485]  He said the so-called controversial part of this law is what some label as the show-me-your-papers component.
[03:14:05.106 --> 03:14:09.308]  He said, what everyone seems to get wrong is they think the provision was stricken down in the Arizona law.
[03:14:09.368 --> 03:14:14.230]  He said, to the contrary, the provision in the Arizona law is stricter than in the Texas law.
[03:14:14.270 --> 03:14:17.811]  The Arizona law required law enforcement to ask for papers.
[03:14:17.831 --> 03:14:19.172]  That's not the case here in Texas.
[03:14:19.512 --> 03:14:26.355]  He said, but despite the difference and the fact that the Arizona law was stricter, the Arizona law was upheld by every U.S.
[03:14:26.395 --> 03:14:28.996]  Supreme Court justice, including the liberals.
[03:14:29.696 --> 03:14:32.738]  The so-called controversial part of this law has been ruled on by the U.S.
[03:14:32.758 --> 03:14:37.262]  Supreme Court and upheld with even the liberal justices upholding that law.
[03:14:38.102 --> 03:14:43.947]  And they said the police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person that they detain, so that part of it hasn't changed.
[03:14:43.987 --> 03:14:51.872]  What has changed is that you had people like Sally Hernandez, and remember when she first took office, she was one of the most
[03:14:53.559 --> 03:14:54.840]  I think so.
[03:15:14.099 --> 03:15:15.700]  And you're not reporting him.
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:17.681]  That's not on your list of three crimes.
[03:15:17.761 --> 03:15:21.324]  And she goes, oh, well, okay, I will not report four crimes, okay?
[03:15:21.404 --> 03:15:26.907]  It's kind of like the Spanish Inquisition with Monty Python, you know, nobody expects the Hispanic Inquisition.
[03:15:27.167 --> 03:15:30.189]  So it's like, now there are four crimes, now there's five, now there's six.
[03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:34.892]  Well, why don't you report them in the first place and let immigration sort this out?
[03:15:35.552 --> 03:15:40.856]  And as the governor pointed out, Kate Steinle, who was killed in San Francisco, who was murdered,
[03:15:41.616 --> 03:15:46.839]  Was an illegal alien or a foreign citizen criminally trespassing in America.
[03:15:46.859 --> 03:15:47.620]  Let's put it that way.
[03:15:48.300 --> 03:15:51.322]  Who was released from a jail here in Texas.
[03:15:52.163 --> 03:15:53.643]  So he's released from a jail here in Texas.
[03:15:53.683 --> 03:15:57.706]  He goes to San Francisco and he kills this woman for no reason at all.
[03:15:57.766 --> 03:16:01.708]  Kate Steinle who became a centerpiece of the Trump campaign.
[03:16:01.768 --> 03:16:08.673]  He said this law makes Texans safer because it prevents the types of policies that California has that lead to the tragic murder of Kate Steinle.
[03:16:11.041 --> 03:16:22.706]  He says it prevents the types of policies that were adopted by the Travis County Sheriff here, who had policies that released back out on the street people are either accused of or even convicted of dangerous crimes.
[03:16:23.586 --> 03:16:27.808]  And at the same time this is happening, we've got a sheriff in Long Island, Suffolk County, where my wife is from,
[03:16:29.284 --> 03:16:33.865]  Uh, took to the airwaves yesterday, criticizing Obama's immigration policies.
[03:16:33.925 --> 03:16:34.125]  Why?
[03:16:34.165 --> 03:16:37.626]  Because they have MS-13, hacking people with machetes.
[03:16:37.966 --> 03:16:39.646]  Same thing that's happening in Maryland.
[03:16:39.806 --> 03:16:50.689]  This is a gang that is El Salvadoran in nature, and it really began in LA, but now it has spread from the southwestern United States to the northeastern.
[03:16:50.749 --> 03:16:52.069]  It's spread all the way across the country.
[03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:54.298]  Very heavy in the Maryland area.
[03:16:54.699 --> 03:16:57.405]  Maryland is proud of the fact that they have a lot of sanctuary cities.
[03:16:57.445 --> 03:16:59.450]  They're going to try to become the first sanctuary state.
[03:17:00.152 --> 03:17:02.537]  But it's also happening in Long Island.
[03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:17.956]  The sheriff in Long Island blamed Obama for the recent rash of murders that have been linked to MS-13 gang activities across Long Island, and he applauded Attorney General Jeff Sessions for saying that he's going to address MS-13.
[03:17:17.976 --> 03:17:20.077]  This is what the sheriff on Long Island said.
[03:17:20.658 --> 03:17:24.680]  He said, in the community of Brentwood, where there is a big El Salvadoran population,
[03:17:25.140 --> 03:17:29.925]  We have had, over the last nine months or so, 11 bodies that have turned up.
[03:17:29.985 --> 03:17:33.289]  He said the victims, many of whom were high schoolers who were Hispanic folks.
[03:17:33.989 --> 03:17:36.952]  This isn't a racial issue here.
[03:17:37.073 --> 03:17:39.395]  This is a gang war issue.
[03:17:39.435 --> 03:17:43.559]  Many of these people came to this country because they wanted to escape stuff like MS-13.
[03:17:44.300 --> 03:17:47.183]  And because we have open borders, MS-13 just follows them across.
[03:17:48.146 --> 03:17:53.248]  And they're going to be killing, they're not going to be paying attention to just killing Hispanic people.
[03:17:53.828 --> 03:17:56.048]  They're going to be equal opportunity murderers.
[03:17:56.989 --> 03:18:06.951]  But right now they're focused primarily on the community in which they live because these are people who are either in a rival gang or who are not in their gang or who are part of their gang and they didn't do what they wanted them to do.
[03:18:07.332 --> 03:18:09.992]  So that's why this is centered on that right now.
[03:18:10.012 --> 03:18:11.613]  But we don't see that happening with anybody.
[03:18:12.278 --> 03:18:12.718]  I mean, do you?
[03:18:12.798 --> 03:18:19.503]  Why is it that immigration advocates don't have any compassion for Hispanic migrants who come here and are victims of MS-13?
[03:18:19.543 --> 03:18:26.048]  He said they've been targeted for refusing to join the gang or for defecting from its ranks.
[03:18:26.088 --> 03:18:29.090]  He said a large portion of MS-13 gang members are here illegally.
[03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:30.911]  They arrive in this country through, guess what?
[03:18:31.331 --> 03:18:33.213]  The unaccompanied minor program.
[03:18:33.253 --> 03:18:34.013]  They're dreamers.
[03:18:34.353 --> 03:18:38.837]  They're dreamers who came here under Obama's relaxed rules.
[03:18:40.051 --> 03:18:50.273]  And as we said before, you know, the people who are coming here and they're saying these are minors turning up, people like Glenn Beck showing up at the border with teddy bears for MS-13 members.
[03:18:50.293 --> 03:19:03.356]  I mean, seriously, folks, do you really think that eight-year-olds are making the trip across the border, across Mexico, across Central America by themselves as unaccompanied minors?
[03:19:04.316 --> 03:19:05.657]  That whole thing is a lie.
[03:19:07.062 --> 03:19:08.383]  It's an absurd lie.
[03:19:09.123 --> 03:19:15.568]  These people that Glenn Beck and others are showing up, handing out teddy bears to these people, if they need teddy bears, they didn't come here unaccompanied.
[03:19:16.048 --> 03:19:25.335]  No, they came here, the border is controlled, as we've talked to people, Breitbart reporter who's part of the border project that they have, he said, the border has controls on it.
[03:19:25.395 --> 03:19:26.756]  It's not a completely open border.
[03:19:26.856 --> 03:19:28.857]  The people who control it are the gang members.
[03:19:29.798 --> 03:19:32.459]  And of course the gang members themselves are young,
[03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:38.665]  Strappling characters who come here for a free education, but they're gonna give us an education.
[03:19:39.205 --> 03:19:41.247]  An education in gang warfare.
[03:19:41.707 --> 03:19:46.051]  As the sheriff said, the MS-13 mantra is kill, rape, and control.
[03:19:47.012 --> 03:19:48.113]  That's what they're about, folks.
[03:19:48.433 --> 03:19:49.073]  We gotta stop it.
[03:19:49.294 --> 03:19:50.475]  Alright, stay with us when we come back.
[03:19:50.495 --> 03:19:55.539]  We're gonna talk about the Second Amendment getting shot in the back by some gun manufacturers.
[03:19:55.579 --> 03:19:56.500]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:02.970 --> 03:20:04.732]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[03:20:04.752 --> 03:20:06.815]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[03:20:06.855 --> 03:20:10.279]  We've been getting these different flavors, and you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:13.723]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff, and I'm an old man.
[03:20:13.743 --> 03:20:14.324]  I'm 42.
[03:20:14.364 --> 03:20:17.248]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[03:20:17.428 --> 03:20:18.890]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[03:20:21.291 --> 03:20:21.951]  No, I'm not.
[03:20:21.991 --> 03:20:22.632]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:22.692 --> 03:20:23.232]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:23.332 --> 03:20:30.474]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[03:20:31.074 --> 03:20:38.296]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[03:20:38.316 --> 03:20:41.797]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[03:20:43.197 --> 03:20:48.440]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:51.562]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[03:20:51.963 --> 03:20:53.223]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[03:20:53.244 --> 03:20:54.564]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[03:20:54.905 --> 03:20:56.045]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[03:20:56.065 --> 03:21:03.250]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[03:21:03.670 --> 03:21:05.751]  Yeah.
[03:21:05.791 --> 03:21:11.413]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[03:21:11.473 --> 03:21:13.194]  I felt it immediately.
[03:21:13.414 --> 03:21:15.434]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[03:21:15.514 --> 03:21:18.595]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[03:21:18.776 --> 03:21:19.756]  It tastes good to me.
[03:21:19.856 --> 03:21:23.797]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[03:21:23.837 --> 03:21:25.978]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[03:21:28.599 --> 03:21:29.680]  Bone broth.
[03:21:29.740 --> 03:21:34.862]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[03:21:34.882 --> 03:21:38.623]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[03:21:38.683 --> 03:21:46.427]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[03:21:46.487 --> 03:21:49.848]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my own thing.
[03:21:49.868 --> 03:21:51.629]  Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:55.111]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street.
[03:21:55.211 --> 03:21:58.374]  I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[03:21:58.394 --> 03:21:59.674]  No fear, nothing.
[03:22:00.657 --> 03:22:07.999]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[03:22:08.539 --> 03:22:10.380]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:21.623]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[03:22:21.683 --> 03:22:22.923]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[03:22:22.963 --> 03:22:29.065]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[03:22:30.345 --> 03:22:32.586]  A borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[03:22:32.626 --> 03:22:34.828]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[03:22:34.848 --> 03:22:42.932]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[03:22:42.952 --> 03:22:46.274]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[03:22:46.314 --> 03:22:49.176]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[03:22:49.276 --> 03:22:54.659]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[03:22:55.359 --> 03:23:02.206]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[03:23:07.219 --> 03:23:08.720]  There is a crisis in America today.
[03:23:09.181 --> 03:23:11.603]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:23:11.903 --> 03:23:19.310]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[03:23:19.690 --> 03:23:23.313]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[03:23:23.673 --> 03:23:24.814]  I have the answer for you today.
[03:23:25.215 --> 03:23:26.376]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[03:23:27.113 --> 03:23:32.756]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[03:23:32.856 --> 03:23:38.600]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.902]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[03:23:42.102 --> 03:23:48.066]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[03:23:48.706 --> 03:23:50.489]  With a block-it pocket, this is impossible.
[03:23:50.969 --> 03:23:53.673]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.

[03:24:06.972 --> 03:24:10.033]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:10.073 --> 03:24:10.733]  Monday, May 8th, 2017.
[03:24:10.834 --> 03:24:11.954]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:11.994 --> 03:24:15.536]  We're going to go to some news about firearms out of Illinois.
[03:24:23.539 --> 03:24:29.181]  But before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you we have a sign-up special at our newsletter.
[03:24:29.241 --> 03:24:34.723]  If you haven't signed up for the special yet, you can sign up for the newsletter.
[03:24:34.743 --> 03:24:40.985]  You can sign up for the InfoWars newsletter and get 40% off a MicroBreeze negative ion generator.
[03:24:41.005 --> 03:24:42.646]  And of course, our newsletter is free.
[03:24:43.266 --> 03:24:44.747]  It doesn't cost you anything to sign up for that.
[03:24:45.427 --> 03:24:54.430]  And it gets you information without being filtered by Facebook or Google or any of the other gatekeepers of information that are stacking up everywhere over the internet.
[03:24:54.690 --> 03:24:55.890]  It's one of the reasons we have that there.
[03:24:55.910 --> 03:25:00.852]  But every day we have specials that are part of the newsletter for our newsletter subscribers.
[03:25:00.972 --> 03:25:01.953]  And again, it's free.
[03:25:02.053 --> 03:25:06.794]  Today, if you sign up for that, you get 40% off the MicroBreeze negative ion generator.
[03:25:06.854 --> 03:25:08.415]  Also, we have super blue fluoride
[03:25:08.755 --> 03:25:11.617]  Free toothpaste is now back in stock for a limited time.
[03:25:11.937 --> 03:25:13.659]  It is 33% off retail.
[03:25:13.679 --> 03:25:13.659]  $9.95.
[03:25:13.839 --> 03:25:15.120]  Give that a try.
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:18.042]  I think if you try it, that's one of the reasons we put this on special.
[03:25:18.102 --> 03:25:21.244]  I think everybody who tries it absolutely loves it.
[03:25:21.744 --> 03:25:25.007]  And if you try it, you're going to want to sign up, I think, for AutoShip.
[03:25:25.587 --> 03:25:26.508]  And get a discount.
[03:25:26.528 --> 03:25:29.549]  Make sure you don't run out of toothpaste, because that's happened to us here.
[03:25:29.609 --> 03:25:34.092]  It sold so quickly, my family ran out of it after we fell in love with it.
[03:25:34.172 --> 03:25:36.933]  So you can sign up for AutoShip for that or for any product.
[03:25:37.173 --> 03:25:42.036]  You can save 10% off of the price of the order, and you can also get free shipping.
[03:25:42.096 --> 03:25:47.178]  If your regular reshipping is more than $50, you get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:25:47.779 --> 03:25:50.580]  Let's take a look real quickly at this story that has shaped up.
[03:25:51.121 --> 03:25:53.222]  Last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of talk
[03:25:54.008 --> 03:25:59.731]  In the gun community about what happened in Illinois and I think it's very illustrative of what happens with our rights in general.
[03:25:59.771 --> 03:26:05.833]  I'm going to talk about this more tonight on the nightly news, but here it is in a nutshell because I have some other stuff I want to talk about as well.
[03:26:05.873 --> 03:26:11.316]  Basically, you have the state government in Illinois, not friendly to the Second Amendment,
[03:26:12.284 --> 03:26:26.912]  They want to do things to shut down gun shows in Illinois, so they came up with a scheme to essentially require you to be a federal firearms licensed to sell more than nine firearms a year, or to buy.
[03:26:27.993 --> 03:26:30.034]  Buy or sell more than nine firearms a year.
[03:26:30.915 --> 03:26:37.318]  Well, that created a problem for two of the gun manufacturers that are in that state, Springfield and Rock River Arms.
[03:26:38.079 --> 03:26:40.220]  And of course, Springfield Armory is a very old
[03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:46.051]  Gun Company started in the 1800s actually out of Massachusetts.
[03:26:46.071 --> 03:26:53.133]  They went out of business in the 1960s but they were bought by a couple of brothers in Illinois and relocated into Illinois.
[03:26:53.153 --> 03:27:02.635]  So you've got a couple of gun manufacturers in Illinois and they actually created an organization called the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association.
[03:27:03.646 --> 03:27:09.728]  This group has a lobbyist because, of course, you need to kind of protect your back if you're dealing with firearms in Illinois, of all places.
[03:27:10.489 --> 03:27:21.353]  Unfortunately, what happened was, as they were pushing this bill through the state legislature, their lobbyist for the Illinois firearms manufacturers, their lobbyist cut a deal.
[03:27:22.352 --> 03:27:22.792]  We're good to go.
[03:27:42.850 --> 03:27:43.991]  We're in the firearms business.
[03:27:44.031 --> 03:27:46.213]  We hired a lobbyist because we don't do that type of thing.
[03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:47.574]  So they distanced themselves from it.
[03:27:47.954 --> 03:27:54.620]  As a matter of fact, Rock River Arms actually said, we have dropped out of the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association.
[03:27:55.181 --> 03:27:57.843]  Which means that there's now only one company that's involved there.
[03:27:57.883 --> 03:28:10.114]  Because if you look at their filing, you had of the five people in the organization, two of them were the present CEO brothers of one of these companies, and the other two were
[03:28:11.121 --> 03:28:13.683]  Brothers of the other firearm companies.
[03:28:13.703 --> 03:28:16.325]  So two of them were from Springfield, two of them were from Rock River.
[03:28:16.405 --> 03:28:18.246]  These are the CEOs of these companies.
[03:28:18.867 --> 03:28:20.588]  And the fifth person was the paid lobbyist.
[03:28:20.708 --> 03:28:25.452]  And they said they had no idea what he was doing, that he was cutting a deal to get them on the outside.
[03:28:25.492 --> 03:28:27.053]  So that's the problem that we see.
[03:28:27.073 --> 03:28:29.575]  And it isn't just this particular situation in Illinois.
[03:28:29.735 --> 03:28:31.036]  And it isn't just the Second Amendment.
[03:28:31.716 --> 03:28:33.037]  This is the way lobbying works.
[03:28:33.117 --> 03:28:33.657]  It's Lobbying 101.
[03:28:35.078 --> 03:28:43.302]  You have people who can afford to get legislation crafted to help them get their own tax deductions or to exempt them from the laws.
[03:28:44.423 --> 03:28:46.024]  And these laws are put on their competition.
[03:28:46.829 --> 03:28:48.670]  Or it's put on other people and they really don't care.
[03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:50.131]  They buy their way out.
[03:28:50.611 --> 03:28:51.511]  They buy their protection.
[03:28:51.551 --> 03:28:52.892]  That's why they hire the lobbyists.
[03:28:53.332 --> 03:28:54.113]  That's the corruption.
[03:28:54.633 --> 03:28:56.054]  That's the way the swamp works.
[03:28:56.174 --> 03:28:58.935]  Whether it's in Illinois or whether it's in Washington, D.C.
[03:28:59.195 --> 03:29:02.137]  That's how we lose our freedoms through that particular process.
[03:29:02.857 --> 03:29:03.318]  Very shameful.
[03:29:03.338 --> 03:29:05.199]  We'll talk about that a little bit more tonight on the Nightly News.
[03:29:05.239 --> 03:29:07.880]  But I want to take a look now at the Streisand effect.
[03:29:09.161 --> 03:29:10.361]  Remember Barbara Streisand?
[03:29:10.381 --> 03:29:15.842]  She was very upset in the days before we had Google Earth where you could look at any particular location.
[03:29:15.882 --> 03:29:19.923]  She was upset because somebody published some pictures of her house and she made a big stink out of it.
[03:29:19.963 --> 03:29:24.844]  All of a sudden it got so popular that everybody was publishing pictures of her house.
[03:29:25.144 --> 03:29:26.105]  That's the Streisand effect.
[03:29:26.745 --> 03:29:30.505]  So we have Barbara Streisand in New York talking about Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:30.746 --> 03:29:32.506]  If only Hillary Clinton had been president.
[03:29:33.146 --> 03:29:35.708]  And when I look at this, it's like, now that's the Streisand effect.
[03:29:35.828 --> 03:29:43.815]  As disappointed as we may be in many of the things that Donald Trump has done or has failed to do, like failed to repeal Obamacare, yes, they are moving in the right direction with that.
[03:29:44.316 --> 03:29:46.798]  But as we're disappointed, think about the Streisand effect.
[03:29:46.878 --> 03:29:50.661]  She just reminded us all that Hillary Clinton is not president.
[03:29:51.261 --> 03:29:52.923]  And we can really be happy about that.
[03:29:53.423 --> 03:29:55.025]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.965 --> 03:29:58.628]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.898 --> 03:30:09.164]  The anthropogenic globalists have won the French presidential election, with Macron becoming the youngest French president ever.
[03:30:09.184 --> 03:30:13.108]  Macron won in a landslide, thanks to many simply voting against Le Pen.
[03:30:13.268 --> 03:30:15.911]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election.
[03:30:16.131 --> 03:30:22.858]  Leaked documents revealed Macron would cater to Islam, Antifa, the EU, as well as his own personal offshore bank accounts.
[03:30:23.018 --> 03:30:25.099]  There will be no investigating into the U.S.
[03:30:25.159 --> 03:30:29.780]  meddling in the French election, despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S.
[03:30:29.860 --> 03:30:34.221]  news network endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist.
[03:30:34.341 --> 03:30:41.423]  The fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist, as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[03:30:41.523 --> 03:30:45.964]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive la France.
[03:30:46.244 --> 03:30:50.368]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate.
[03:30:50.428 --> 03:30:51.809]  They cheer hooray for France.
[03:30:52.049 --> 03:30:52.950]  Long live France!
[03:30:53.190 --> 03:30:59.635]  As this election will likely mark the end of France and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.
[03:30:59.795 --> 03:31:02.317]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:02.998 --> 03:31:10.764]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:10.985 --> 03:31:15.128]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor-piercing
[03:31:15.728 --> 03:31:17.389]  FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:31:17.610 --> 03:31:25.895]  The secret to Defender body armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:31:26.195 --> 03:31:31.818]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:31:32.058 --> 03:31:34.940]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:31:35.180 --> 03:31:40.944]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:31:41.284 --> 03:31:41.744]  It works.
[03:31:42.044 --> 03:31:50.346]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:31:50.366 --> 03:31:59.889]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:32:00.249 --> 03:32:00.729]  A total 360 win.
[03:32:03.985 --> 03:32:09.328]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:32:09.488 --> 03:32:10.068]  I take this.
[03:32:10.328 --> 03:32:11.349]  My family takes this.
[03:32:11.449 --> 03:32:15.691]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:32:15.731 --> 03:32:20.233]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:20.333 --> 03:32:24.896]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:32:24.976 --> 03:32:26.016]  I don't feel good.
[03:32:26.116 --> 03:32:29.618]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:32:29.878 --> 03:32:32.520]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:37.883]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:32:38.363 --> 03:32:40.784]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:32:41.325 --> 03:32:44.766]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[03:32:44.867 --> 03:32:47.048]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:32:47.088 --> 03:32:47.448]  I love it.
[03:32:47.608 --> 03:32:50.210]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:32:50.410 --> 03:32:51.391]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:51.431 --> 03:32:57.376]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:57.396 --> 03:32:59.018]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:32:59.258 --> 03:33:01.240]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:33:09.096 --> 03:33:09.557]  News.
[03:33:10.158 --> 03:33:10.979]  Analysis.
[03:33:11.480 --> 03:33:12.141]  Reports.
[03:33:12.922 --> 03:33:15.065]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.846 --> 03:33:18.610]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:33:22.165 --> 03:33:23.606]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.626 --> 03:33:26.509]  I'm David Knight, and joining us now is author George Neumeier.
[03:33:26.869 --> 03:33:37.137]  He writes at Spectator.org, but he also has a book out that's just come out, The Political Pope, How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives.
[03:33:37.178 --> 03:33:43.463]  I think it's very interesting to talk about this subject because, of course, at the end of last week we just had an executive order from Donald Trump.
[03:33:44.261 --> 03:33:49.165]  Talking about how he wanted the Johnson Amendment to not be enforced against churches.
[03:33:49.786 --> 03:34:05.158]  And of course, if you don't know what the Johnson Amendment is, that is the IRS regulation, essentially, that would say that for tax deductible or for 501c3 corporations, which many churches are to get their tax deduction, that they cannot talk about politics.
[03:34:05.278 --> 03:34:11.704]  And so that classification, lumping churches together with just tax-exempt organizations,
[03:34:12.859 --> 03:34:14.360]  It's kind of confusing to start with.
[03:34:14.780 --> 03:34:23.244]  And there's now been a back and forth within conservative churches and Protestant churches as to whether or not they even want their churches to be involved with this.
[03:34:23.284 --> 03:34:25.005]  Many of them say, well, we don't want to see this happen.
[03:34:25.025 --> 03:34:26.845]  Well, they don't have to talk about politics.
[03:34:27.226 --> 03:34:28.906]  The Pope doesn't have to talk about politics.
[03:34:28.966 --> 03:34:30.507]  They could stick to the subject.
[03:34:30.547 --> 03:34:32.688]  People can decide which church they want to go to.
[03:34:33.188 --> 03:34:33.868]  I think we ought to...
[03:34:35.089 --> 03:34:37.410]  Feeling on this is that we ought to get the IRS out of it.
[03:34:37.430 --> 03:34:47.315]  But I want to hear what George Neumeier says about this, but also about the politics of the Pope, because he has not been silent at all about what he wants to see happen.
[03:34:47.435 --> 03:34:57.200]  And it is a real 180 from what we have seen in the Catholic Church, as you point out, possibly the most liberal Pope that we have ever had.
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:34:58.801]  Thank you for joining us, George Neumeier.
[03:35:00.370 --> 03:35:01.210]  Thank you for having me.
[03:35:02.051 --> 03:35:08.794]  Give us a little bit of a sense of what you're concerned about here in this book, The Political Pope.
[03:35:08.834 --> 03:35:12.336]  Tell us some of the things that you're concerned about with the Pope that he's gotten involved in.
[03:35:12.356 --> 03:35:20.160]  Of course, we've reported on this, but let's just go over some of the more obvious things that this Pope who's promoted a globalist agenda has done.
[03:35:20.180 --> 03:35:28.684]  Well, yeah, as you point out, the Church has gone from an anti-communist Pope in John Paul II
[03:35:29.668 --> 03:35:32.971]  To now a pope who's flirting with communism.
[03:35:33.832 --> 03:35:47.483]  And Francis has become the darling of the global left by aggressively pushing open borders, socialism, gun control, pacifism of various kinds.
[03:35:48.384 --> 03:35:54.790]  He's clamoring for the elimination of lifetime imprisonment, which is a position so far to the left that the U.S.
[03:35:54.830 --> 03:35:56.091]  Democrats don't even take it.
[03:35:56.829 --> 03:36:07.933]  So on issue after issue, he is enlisting the church in the causes of the global left, and that's having a tremendously divisive effect on the church.
[03:36:08.614 --> 03:36:20.998]  And it's having a very bad effect on our politics because it's making it easier for the Democrats to present themselves as as being in line with religion when really they're not.
[03:36:21.098 --> 03:36:24.920]  Everybody knows that the Democrats have become a godless party
[03:36:25.384 --> 03:36:33.452]  That is in favor of abortion, and that is not interested in giving religion any role within public life.
[03:36:34.032 --> 03:36:45.283]  The Democrats are the party of secularism, and so it is perverse that the Pope would be enlisting, would be making it easier for the Democrats to be successful in politics.
[03:36:45.973 --> 03:36:54.297]  And as you pointed out in your press release here, you say that radical academic Cornel West has said Pope Francis is a gift from heaven.
[03:36:55.398 --> 03:37:03.082]  In the write-up on your book on Amazon, you point out that we've had Tom Hayden, who is Jane Fonda's husband, very radical.
[03:37:03.502 --> 03:37:09.966]  He said the selection of Pope Francis was more miraculous than the rise of Barack Obama in 2008.
[03:37:10.026 --> 03:37:12.407]  They're very happy with what he's doing.
[03:37:12.927 --> 03:37:25.850]  The globalists are very happy with what he's doing, and if you look at the tenets of globalism, from economics, that he's pushing a very radical socialism, a communism, if you will, also pushing climate change.
[03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:38.733]  He's not speaking ex-cathedra, he's not speaking from the chair when he talks about science, he's not speaking from the chair when he speaks about economics, and that's the concern that many people in the Catholic Church have with him as well, isn't it?
[03:37:40.632 --> 03:37:46.384]  Yeah, he's really turned the Vatican into almost like an annex of Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.
[03:37:46.404 --> 03:37:51.214]  You know, the Vatican is now crawling with radical environmentalists.
[03:37:51.747 --> 03:38:06.856]  Jeffrey Sachs, Naomi Klein, Al Gore, Bill de Blasio, Bernie Sanders, all of these extreme environmentalists show up at the Vatican and they promote the rawest forms of climate change activism.
[03:38:07.296 --> 03:38:12.799]  In fact, as I discuss in the book, there is this really outrageous use of St.
[03:38:12.839 --> 03:38:13.920]  Peter's Basilica
[03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:19.886]  It was used as a backdrop for a climate change propaganda film.
[03:38:20.187 --> 03:38:21.288]  So the facade of St.
[03:38:21.328 --> 03:38:30.859]  Peter's Basilica was actually used as a movie screen for an Al Gore-style propaganda film, and I detail that in the book.
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:34.424]  And so that's very characteristic of this Vatican.
[03:38:34.929 --> 03:38:49.298]  And of course he's also had, when he did his climate encyclical that he put out, that many people did not realize, if they're not involved in the Catholic Church, many people don't realize that that's not something that is an official pronouncement.
[03:38:49.538 --> 03:38:55.702]  Nevertheless, it was being sold that way by the media, and the people who were working with him as speechwriters and preparing that,
[03:38:56.582 --> 03:38:56.822]  We're
[03:39:15.191 --> 03:39:18.115]  That's right, and you may recall that a few years back he actually told Catholics
[03:39:33.962 --> 03:39:36.183]  To quote-unquote not breed like rabbits?
[03:39:36.704 --> 03:39:36.904]  Yeah.
[03:39:37.344 --> 03:39:40.326]  And that was very indicative of his mindset.
[03:39:40.866 --> 03:39:47.450]  And as you point out, these population control advocates are showing up at the Vatican in great numbers.
[03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:57.455]  And one of the recent ones who showed up was Paul Ehrlich, who you may recall was one of the loudest opponents for not only birth control but compulsory abortions.
[03:39:59.056 --> 03:40:00.978]  In the 1960s and the 1970s.
[03:40:01.058 --> 03:40:05.501]  And he received an invitation to speak at the Vatican just a month or so ago.
[03:40:06.562 --> 03:40:16.268]  Let me ask you this, because we're talking about the Johnson Amendment, and there's been a lot of back and forth within Protestant denominations as to whether or not they went to the Baptist official.
[03:40:16.769 --> 03:40:21.392]  Southern Baptists have said, we don't want our churches talking about politics, so we like the Johnson Amendment.
[03:40:21.752 --> 03:40:23.934]  To me, it seems like people ought to be able to talk about it.
[03:40:24.454 --> 03:40:25.134]  Whether or not they want to.
[03:40:25.154 --> 03:40:26.775]  That's something they should be able to make up their mind.
[03:40:26.795 --> 03:40:28.596]  If you don't want to go to that church, you go to a different church.
[03:40:28.656 --> 03:40:29.757]  It doesn't talk about politics.
[03:40:30.197 --> 03:40:41.283]  Some churches might want to make the connections in your everyday life or to candidates who support abortion or who fight against abortion or people who support slavery, for example.
[03:40:41.303 --> 03:40:47.806]  If we go back to the 19th century, we had William Wilberforce and many Christians there who were leading the fight against slavery.
[03:40:47.846 --> 03:40:51.628]  So there are moral issues that have political dimensions to them.
[03:40:52.108 --> 03:40:53.188]  And I would even go farther.
[03:40:53.229 --> 03:40:57.690]  I would even say that my politics is informed by my morality.
[03:40:57.770 --> 03:41:07.614]  And if we divorce ourselves from that, then we're into this kind of pragmatic, Machiavellian, Henry Kissinger, Real politic that has absolutely no moral principles.
[03:41:07.714 --> 03:41:09.575]  I don't think we want to be led by people like that.
[03:41:09.875 --> 03:41:21.280]  And so I don't really have a problem with talking about those, with making a connection between the way that we are to live in our life as Christians and the politics that fall out of that.
[03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:23.101]  But there's some people who just don't want to see that happening.
[03:41:23.341 --> 03:41:35.484]  What is happening in the Catholic Church when you have such a politicized pope that is making all these pronouncements about depopulation of the earth, climate change, and so forth, and pushing for socialism?
[03:41:35.845 --> 03:41:38.265]  What is the pushback within the church?
[03:41:39.946 --> 03:41:46.888]  Well, conservative Catholics welcome Trump's proposal because they want priests to be able to endorse pro-life Republicans.
[03:41:47.481 --> 03:41:55.367]  And they want priests to, you know, say that the Democrat who's supporting gay marriage or whatever is unacceptable.
[03:41:55.507 --> 03:41:58.229]  And so they're actually cheering Trump's proposal.
[03:41:58.850 --> 03:42:10.679]  Ironically, the priests and the bishops who don't like the proposal are the very left-wing ones who are talking politics all the time in the worst sense of the word.
[03:42:11.140 --> 03:42:15.283]  You know, they're often getting involved in politics when it doesn't involve church teaching.
[03:42:15.763 --> 03:42:23.509]  But when it does involve church teaching, like the abortion issue, they don't want to talk politics or they don't want the church to be taking a position.
[03:42:23.569 --> 03:42:27.812]  And so they've made some snide remarks about Trump's proposal.
[03:42:28.132 --> 03:42:40.682]  But I would say that the Orthodox and the traditional and the conservative Catholics are very happy to hear that Trump is willing to protect priests who defend pro-life Republicans and traditional family types.
[03:42:40.987 --> 03:42:45.108]  And you know, we've seen that type of thing happen as well in Protestant churches.
[03:42:45.228 --> 03:42:49.769]  It's very common to see black Protestant churches bring in people like Jesse Jackson.
[03:42:50.189 --> 03:42:56.411]  And that would be, under the Johnson Amendment, that would be a no-no, because you would be directly tying this to a political candidate.
[03:42:56.431 --> 03:43:01.572]  In other words, they're saying, well, you can talk about broad principles, but you can't talk about a specific candidate.
[03:43:01.592 --> 03:43:02.512]  Yet they give it a pass.
[03:43:03.052 --> 03:43:08.096]  When it happens with Democrats, just like you're talking about, they give it a pass when it happens on the liberal side.
[03:43:08.356 --> 03:43:15.641]  And I'm sure they would not like to see a situation where you have a conservative priest talking about a local election.
[03:43:16.242 --> 03:43:27.710]  They would much rather just leave it with the political pope who's going to talk about things in a broader context and shut up everybody that is downstream who might be applying some conservative principles to a local election.
[03:43:29.403 --> 03:43:29.924]  That's right.
[03:43:30.024 --> 03:43:43.361]  Yeah, they would prefer that Pope Francis be the sole spokesman for the Catholic Church because he's a non-stop chatterbox and voice box for the global left and for the Democratic Party.
[03:43:44.001 --> 03:43:48.127]  But, you know, as you're pointing out, just because you're religious,
[03:43:48.567 --> 03:43:50.909]  It shouldn't mean that you lose your right to free speech.
[03:43:51.630 --> 03:44:00.477]  And the very fact that this law was enacted was a reflection of the secularism of the 1960s, which was very anti-religious.
[03:44:01.177 --> 03:44:05.060]  Yeah, and of course we always hear about the separation of church and state.
[03:44:05.561 --> 03:44:06.241]  That's taken out.
[03:44:06.261 --> 03:44:07.963]  That's not in the Declaration of Independence.
[03:44:07.983 --> 03:44:09.384]  It's certainly not in the Constitution.
[03:44:09.404 --> 03:44:15.649]  It's in a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to some Baptists in Connecticut because they were concerned.
[03:44:15.669 --> 03:44:16.309]  They had believed it.
[03:44:17.350 --> 03:44:19.312]  A lot of false information about elections.
[03:44:19.352 --> 03:44:26.538]  Of course, at the time, there was all this information from his opponent, John Adams, saying that Thomas Jefferson was going to confiscate everybody's Bibles.
[03:44:26.578 --> 03:44:28.820]  So they literally had people burying their Bibles in the backyard.
[03:44:28.840 --> 03:44:32.423]  And he was writing to them to reassure them that he wasn't going to mess with them.
[03:44:32.463 --> 03:44:34.805]  He said, there's a wall that separates us from you.
[03:44:35.726 --> 03:44:40.229]  And that wall, in his opinion, was a wall around the government's actions.
[03:44:40.289 --> 03:44:49.215]  But what we have seen, beginning in the 1960s, was the Supreme Court put that wall around the churches, around Christians, and said, you better stay within this wall.
[03:44:49.856 --> 03:44:53.238]  You can walk around freely within this wall, but you better not get out of that.
[03:44:53.278 --> 03:44:58.641]  You better not talk about or freely exercise your religion in public because we're going to shut that down.
[03:44:58.681 --> 03:45:05.486]  And they do that and have been doing that ever since the 1960s when they incorporated separation of church and state, a phrase that is not in the Constitution.
[03:45:06.366 --> 03:45:12.089]  Let me ask you, one of your other books is No Higher Power, Obama's War on Religious Freedom.
[03:45:12.770 --> 03:45:18.073]  What is the political activism of this Pope doing in the Catholic Church?
[03:45:18.153 --> 03:45:21.034]  Is there something of a civil war within the Catholic Church?
[03:45:21.114 --> 03:45:23.395]  Because we've got Obama declaring war on religious freedom.
[03:45:23.856 --> 03:45:28.058]  Is there a civil war within the Catholic Church between liberals and conservatives?
[03:45:28.118 --> 03:45:32.320]  And what can, if anything, can they do about this liberal political Pope?
[03:45:34.116 --> 03:45:50.049]  There is a very intense civil war going on within the church between liberals and conservatives, and there's a growing number of Catholics, including bishops and cardinals, who are voicing their objections to the liberal direction of this pontificate.
[03:45:50.509 --> 03:46:01.859]  In fact, four cardinals have filed an official request that Pope Francis change his very liberal position on the issue of
[03:46:02.869 --> 03:46:04.710]  Communion for the Divorced and Remarried.
[03:46:05.530 --> 03:46:15.874]  He's in favor of Communion for the Divorced and Remarried, and so these four cardinals have sent him a letter saying that that position is not in conformity with church teaching, and that he needs to give up that position.
[03:46:16.595 --> 03:46:26.979]  Or at the very least, they're seeking clarification on his position, and they've said that if he doesn't respond to their questions, that they're going to move towards a formal correction of him.
[03:46:27.279 --> 03:46:40.707]  So that's an indication that the civil war within the church is really heating up, and I predict over the next, you know, for the remaining years of his pontificate, it's going to become even more visible and even more dramatic.
[03:46:41.107 --> 03:46:41.848]  Let me ask you about that.
[03:46:41.868 --> 03:46:43.949]  You say they might move towards a formal correction.
[03:46:44.409 --> 03:46:45.730]  How does that look?
[03:46:45.770 --> 03:46:47.952]  I'm not a Catholic, so I don't understand.
[03:46:48.012 --> 03:46:49.673]  I mean, they're not going to be able to impeach him.
[03:46:49.773 --> 03:46:54.395]  Are they going to say that on this specific issue, the majority of us disagree with the Pope, therefore he's wrong on this?
[03:46:56.540 --> 03:47:04.610]  The Cardinals are free to stand up and declare that what the Pope has said on this matter is incompatible with Church teaching.
[03:47:04.990 --> 03:47:07.834]  There is nothing that prevents them from making that declaration.
[03:47:08.410 --> 03:47:11.091]  The issue becomes what happens at that point.
[03:47:11.631 --> 03:47:14.992]  If a pope were to say in response to that, well, I don't care.
[03:47:15.012 --> 03:47:17.593]  I don't care that I'm violating church teaching here.
[03:47:17.993 --> 03:47:24.336]  Well, that puts the cardinals into a very, very awkward spot, a position which they've never been in in the history of the church.
[03:47:24.996 --> 03:47:29.077]  And there's different schools of thought on what they could do at that point.
[03:47:29.497 --> 03:47:33.639]  But the consensus view amongst theologians over the centuries has been
[03:47:34.239 --> 03:47:50.203]  That if a Pope commits himself to formal heresy, he thereby self-vacates the seat of Peter, and then at that point the Cardinals could declare the seat empty, and then move to elect a new Pope.
[03:47:50.663 --> 03:47:50.863]  Wow.
[03:47:51.163 --> 03:47:52.003]  That's very interesting.
[03:47:52.583 --> 03:48:03.346]  Because what we see always is that people like Macron, when they are identified as globalists, as internationalists, they are always identified in the press as centrists, as moderates.
[03:48:03.706 --> 03:48:28.421]  They're never identified as extremists or as hardliners, and yet we see increasingly that the people who are promoting globalism, whether it's political leaders or whether it's a religious leader like the Pope, they're never identified as an extremist or a radical or a hardliner, even though their policies are very extreme, radical, hardline, and creating unprecedented division in institutions that have been around a long time, like the Catholic Church.
[03:48:28.701 --> 03:48:32.244]  I think when we look at the ability of people to
[03:48:33.044 --> 03:48:36.185]  Connect their religious beliefs with their political beliefs.
[03:48:36.245 --> 03:48:41.968]  I think we need to go back to somebody who is kind of common to both Catholics and Protestants, to Augustine.
[03:48:42.468 --> 03:48:45.369]  We go back to Augustine and we look at his just war theory.
[03:48:46.170 --> 03:48:53.393]  And we understand that it was something that informed Christian thought, that you would have a very deliberate set of criteria.
[03:48:54.013 --> 03:49:00.141]  Before you go to war, you would have to say, this is going to... First of all, we've had innocent people attacked by aggression.
[03:49:00.762 --> 03:49:07.110]  If we go to war, we can save innocent life, and we're going to lose a lot more innocent life if we do nothing.
[03:49:07.390 --> 03:49:09.152]  So you had these set of criteria.
[03:49:09.733 --> 03:49:19.222]  And that really kind of was the basis of the laws that we had in the West and the basis of our debate before we have a declaration of war in the United States.
[03:49:19.262 --> 03:49:21.164]  I think it's very important to have those types of things.
[03:49:21.504 --> 03:49:24.727]  People don't realize the moral foundations of our legal code.
[03:49:24.747 --> 03:49:31.474]  Whether you're talking about Christianity or Judaism, there are moral foundations that we are now severing.
[03:49:32.014 --> 03:49:33.376]  That we no longer care about.
[03:49:33.416 --> 03:49:36.720]  We no longer have a discussion as to whether or not a war is justified.
[03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:37.801]  We just have war.
[03:49:38.282 --> 03:49:41.145]  And so I think it's very important that we have these types of discussions.
[03:49:41.926 --> 03:49:44.049]  Your comment on that, sir?
[03:49:45.839 --> 03:49:49.180]  Well, yeah, you know, Aquinas, St.
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:50.501]  Thomas Aquinas and St.
[03:49:51.221 --> 03:49:57.463]  Augustine are the classical exponents of the just war theory.
[03:49:58.103 --> 03:50:02.604]  And interestingly, this Pope is moving to get rid of that tradition.
[03:50:02.684 --> 03:50:03.965]  He's set up a commission
[03:50:04.705 --> 03:50:08.946]  Yeah, and we would look at those foundations of Western civilization.
[03:50:33.573 --> 03:50:38.676]  That are based on moral considerations, and those foundations are being destroyed, and what's being put in their place?
[03:50:39.276 --> 03:50:41.037]  The policies of globalism.
[03:50:41.517 --> 03:50:48.100]  The policies of socialism that have resulted in hundreds of millions of people killed in the 20th century alone.
[03:50:48.180 --> 03:50:54.264]  That's what's now being embraced by this Pope, and as you point out at the beginning of the interview, it was rejected by the previous Pope.
[03:50:54.284 --> 03:50:56.205]  He rejected communism and socialism.
[03:50:56.245 --> 03:50:58.266]  Now, those values are being embraced.
[03:50:58.606 --> 03:51:00.026]  Population control is being embraced.
[03:51:00.046 --> 03:51:00.867]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.987 --> 03:51:05.089]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[03:51:05.529 --> 03:51:17.557]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[03:51:17.577 --> 03:51:22.721]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[03:51:22.741 --> 03:51:23.882]  You can look them up for yourself.
[03:51:24.562 --> 03:51:34.264]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[03:51:34.404 --> 03:51:40.566]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[03:51:41.426 --> 03:51:43.286]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[03:51:44.287 --> 03:51:45.507]  People are falling apart.
[03:51:45.547 --> 03:51:46.547]  They're totally depressed.
[03:51:46.567 --> 03:51:47.107]  They're unhappy.
[03:51:47.687 --> 03:51:48.668]  What is going on?
[03:51:49.928 --> 03:51:53.789]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[03:51:55.034 --> 03:51:57.615]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[03:51:57.996 --> 03:51:59.697]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:51:59.897 --> 03:52:06.880]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:15.465]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[03:52:16.877 --> 03:52:23.383]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[03:52:23.744 --> 03:52:27.167]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:52:27.227 --> 03:52:30.330]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[03:52:30.951 --> 03:52:36.036]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:52:36.556 --> 03:52:50.420]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:51.980]  The bone is so amazing.
[03:52:52.380 --> 03:52:57.982]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[03:52:59.110 --> 03:53:02.031]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[03:53:02.571 --> 03:53:08.013]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[03:53:08.294 --> 03:53:17.757]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[03:53:18.037 --> 03:53:22.599]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[03:53:22.839 --> 03:53:24.619]  This is a absolute win-win.
[03:53:24.679 --> 03:53:27.460]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[03:53:27.740 --> 03:53:33.841]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[03:53:44.043 --> 03:53:48.444]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[03:53:48.964 --> 03:53:51.585]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[03:53:52.298 --> 03:53:55.562]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[03:53:55.982 --> 03:53:59.387]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[03:54:18.871 --> 03:54:20.331]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:20.412 --> 03:54:23.392]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're talking to George Neumeier.
[03:54:23.452 --> 03:54:29.955]  He's the author of The Political Pope, How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives.
[03:54:29.975 --> 03:54:32.075]  We'll go back to him for final comments here in just a moment.
[03:54:32.095 --> 03:54:37.137]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you that we still have super blue fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:54:37.757 --> 03:54:40.480]  In stock, for a short time left, it's at $9.95.
[03:54:40.980 --> 03:54:42.542]  That's 33% off.
[03:54:42.602 --> 03:54:46.946]  And again, this has nano silver and iodine, many other ingredients.
[03:54:47.186 --> 03:54:51.910]  It fights gum disease, which leads to heart disease, as well as to tooth loss.
[03:54:51.951 --> 03:54:55.654]  Also, DNA Force is rapidly selling out at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:55.694 --> 03:54:57.436]  It takes us a long time to get that back in stock.
[03:54:57.876 --> 03:55:00.938]  Because of that difficult, expensive ingredient Bio-PQQ.
[03:55:01.018 --> 03:55:04.080]  Costs more than $30,000 per batch to run that.
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:09.964]  And take a look at Infowarslife.com at the reviews that you'll find there.
[03:55:10.064 --> 03:55:16.028]  Also, 175 clinical studies that talk about the effectiveness of Bio-PQQ alone.
[03:55:16.048 --> 03:55:17.329]  And there are many other ingredients in that.
[03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:21.052]  And finally, today's newsletter, you can sign up for free to the newsletter.

[03:55:36.161 --> 03:55:40.744]  It isn't filtered or censored by Facebook or social media in any way.
[03:55:40.804 --> 03:55:44.966]  So that's the important part about signing up for that and daily specials that you'll get from there on out.
[03:55:45.426 --> 03:55:46.407]  So thank you for your support.
[03:55:46.427 --> 03:55:48.968]  Let's go back to George Neumeier.
[03:55:49.229 --> 03:55:52.370]  And again, as we were talking, he has pointed out in his
[03:55:53.615 --> 03:55:56.800]  In his book that this Pope has told atheists not to convert.
[03:55:56.960 --> 03:55:58.382]  He loves secularized Europe.
[03:55:58.803 --> 03:56:00.105]  He has praised the Koran.
[03:56:00.946 --> 03:56:06.474]  He has brought in science advisors who advocate zero depopulation.
[03:56:06.514 --> 03:56:08.958]  Not zero population growth, but depopulation.
[03:56:10.058 --> 03:56:12.760]  So this is a radical reversal of what we've seen.
[03:56:12.800 --> 03:56:15.802]  We had a Pope prior to that that fought against communism.
[03:56:15.822 --> 03:56:17.042]  He lived in a communist country.
[03:56:17.082 --> 03:56:20.664]  He did not want to see that for people, so he fought against that.
[03:56:20.704 --> 03:56:23.606]  Now this Pope Francis is embracing that.
[03:56:24.406 --> 03:56:26.848]  Your final comments in this segment, Mr. Neumeier.
[03:56:28.168 --> 03:56:35.872]  Yeah, your audience might find my book of interest because I detail the communist and socialist influences on Pope Francis.
[03:56:35.932 --> 03:56:38.674]  I go back and I look at his time in Argentina.
[03:56:39.258 --> 03:56:46.842]  Which was a deeply socialist country that left a very deep impression on his thinking and explains much of his agenda.
[03:56:48.162 --> 03:57:00.248]  Your readers might also, your audience might also be interested in the Pope's attempt to commit the Church to world government to a certain extent.
[03:57:00.308 --> 03:57:02.790]  In the environmental encyclical, the Dato Si,
[03:57:03.823 --> 03:57:11.687]  There are several paragraphs in which he talks about the promotion of international institutions and the promotion of world government.
[03:57:12.107 --> 03:57:20.292]  And the view expressed in that document is that international institutions are better at directing global policy than
[03:57:21.132 --> 03:57:26.196]  Individual countries are and that explains that that explains why?
[03:57:28.318 --> 03:57:38.147]  World government appeals to a liberal like Francis is that he thinks that individual nations and nationalism are an impediment to
[03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:39.330]  We're good to go.
[03:57:54.049 --> 03:58:02.259]  There in South America, the Jesuits who were radical environmentalists as well as socialists and advocates of communism.
[03:58:02.700 --> 03:58:07.365]  As I point out many times, what we see with these people is that they're watermelons.
[03:58:07.385 --> 03:58:13.292]  They have a thin veneer of green on the outside, may these environmentalists, but inside they are thoroughly red.
[03:58:13.953 --> 03:58:19.279]  That's basically what we're seeing from this Pope and from his influences there in Central and South America.
[03:58:19.299 --> 03:58:20.481]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:58:20.561 --> 03:58:26.889]  George Neumeier, again, his book is The Political Pope, How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives.
[03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:30.733]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:30.873 --> 03:58:31.134]  Eastern.
[03:58:45.074 --> 03:58:49.036]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:52.518 --> 03:59:00.462]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and Liberals is surely maddening.
[03:59:00.702 --> 03:59:09.767]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention, the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage at the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[03:59:09.787 --> 03:59:14.171]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[03:59:31.527 --> 03:59:40.209]  But now The Hill has published a story, the 43 people who might run against Trump, which includes the worst of the Democrat Party, and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:46.171]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus act fit of berserking.
[03:59:46.251 --> 03:59:50.512]  I'm Owen Schroer, and for InfoWars.com, the Trump effect has been huge.
[03:59:53.713 --> 03:59:59.595]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
