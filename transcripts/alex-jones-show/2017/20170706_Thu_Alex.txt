[00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:23.521]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:35.469]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.050]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.631]  We're here live.
[00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:37.632]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:39.014]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.876]  Look at the Drugs Report headline.
[00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.580]  Trump, the West will never be broken.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.010]  And then I look at Atlantic Monthly yesterday saying white people are the problem and must be done away with and that the West will fall.
[00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:58.405]  No, we're not quoting Mordor or Sauron out of Lord of the Rings.
[00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:01.907]  We are quoting the globalists.
[00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.469]  We're quoting the Democratic Party.
[00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.693]  These are white people, folks, but they want to have a racial collision globally.
[00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:12.115]  They want global division.
[00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:13.976]  They are unbelievable.
[00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:20.441]  They can do the math and know that 7 billion people are not what you'd call Caucasian.
[00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:32.141]  And say, if we fill them full of racism and hate of the West, we can exploit them and use them as reverse colonization, reverse colonialism to bring down the West.
[00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:42.984]  That is what globalism is, in essence, with a bunch of tax-exempt mega-banks ruling over everybody and using internal country controls to have high taxes that actually destroy their competition.
[00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:59.948]  But Trump goes to Poland, who's had no terror attacks, very nationalistic, very liberal generally, but they love Trump because they understand the message of prosperity, they love Ronald Reagan, they want free market, and they understand that America is back.
[00:02:00.288 --> 00:02:05.152]  Here is Trump arriving in Poland last night to rock star fanfare.
[00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:06.233]  Here it is.
[00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:43.260]  This is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never ever forgotten who they are.
[00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:10.879]  You see, it's such a breath of fresh air to people that have been under totalitarianism to actually think that the United States is actually being taken back from the globalists.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.664]  I've also got footage of his motorcade last night being blocked by cheering crowds.
[00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:16.465]  It's even more powerful.
[00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:17.426]  That's coming up.
[00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:22.391]  Now, some of the media is saying Trump's finally turned against Russia.
[00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:31.998]  No, what Trump's doing going into a meeting tomorrow with Putin is saying a lot of strong things up front for negotiating strength tomorrow.
[00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.459]  Of course, Putin knows that.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.223]  Just like he said a lot of real serious stuff to the Chinese president before going into a meeting with him.
[00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.806]  And it is true that Russia is, again, on the border of Poland.
[00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:56.846]  On the border of Ukraine, but it's been the West stirring up the trouble, violating the deal that was set at the end of the Cold War in 1991, that we would not expand to the old Warsaw Pact, and into the East, former Soviet satellites, that they would not expand to the West.
[00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:05.172]  And it has been Bill Clinton to a certain extent, George W. Bush, and Obama big time, that violated those agreements.
[00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:06.453]  That's just facts.
[00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:07.874]  Those are agreements.
[00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.349]  That's
[00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.420]  Trump actually wants in to Russia for all those resources.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.181]  It'd be a match made in heaven.
[00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.464]  Economically, Russia has more resources than any geographic area.
[00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:38.344]  It's huge.
[00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.546]  But more than Africa, ladies and gentlemen, and a lot more than the United States.
[00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:48.530]  Last time I checked, I think Russia has about four times general resources than the United States.
[00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.971]  So that is a big issue right there.
[00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:56.074]  We need economic development, not continued stalemates and military
[00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.373]  Confrontation that only empowers the globalist.
[00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.095]  Big transmission straight ahead.
[00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:02.536]  Stay with us.
[00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:25.534]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:27.055]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:28.596]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:31.058]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:32.279]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:33.059]  Big waiting list.
[00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.842]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:38.463]  Nobody's got something this good.
[00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:44.967]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.
[00:05:45.027 --> 00:05:48.569]  Probiotic MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and welcome
[00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:52.590]  Grab the ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.412]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZX and InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[00:05:58.432 --> 00:06:00.873]  10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:06.575]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's-type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:07.175]  Now it's epidemic.
[00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:10.056]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:12.356]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:15.417]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:26.156]  To celebrate this July 4th, I want to ask everybody to redouble their efforts, to spread the word, and to take action against tyranny.
[00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:31.437]  We have store-wide free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com through July 4th.
[00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:37.079]  Deep Earth, Pure Iodine, X2, now back in stock, 30% off.
[00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.860]  Z-Shield, our newest product, out of the gates, 30% off, because it's so amazing and I want you to try it.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.061]  So for myself, the InfoWars crew, and my family, I want to wish you all a wonderful 4th of July, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.955]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:59.217]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:04.761]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:11.145]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.428]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:07:14.588 --> 00:07:16.049]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.372]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:23.434]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:25.076]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:28.378]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:07:28.638 --> 00:07:30.980]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.201]  It's in powder form.
[00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.003]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:35.784]  I take this.
[00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:37.585]  This is the product that I take.
[00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:39.667]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:41.267]  We fight the Globals.
[00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:42.167]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:48.329]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:52.309]  We've taken Brain Force and made it Brain Force Plus.
[00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:56.290]  Now at 20% more in the bottle and an even more hardcore formula.
[00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.771]  You owe it to yourself to get these products.
[00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:01.291]  They really have worked for myself, my family.
[00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:03.452]  They have five-star reviews by the thousands.
[00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:04.472]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:25.772]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:27.854]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:34.699]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.083]  Just like witches at black masses.
[00:08:41.244 --> 00:08:43.726]  Evil minds that plot destruction.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:52.402 --> 00:08:56.684]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours as we are every weekday 11 a.m.
[00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:57.265]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:57.305 --> 00:08:57.645]  Central.
[00:08:57.685 --> 00:08:58.866]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:08.352]  Infowars.com is the very sword of truth, the tip of the spear in the fight to restore our Republic and to promote Western civilization values.
[00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:11.734]  That's something the media demonizes and calls racist.
[00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:14.656]  It just simply means free market, renaissance,
[00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:20.312]  Very tolerant societies, truly egalitarian.
[00:09:20.772 --> 00:09:35.555]  But modern leftist systems are authoritarian and very, very oppressive and big corporations have weaponized social distortion, weaponized racial, cultural, religious and ethnic divisions to control populations.
[00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:41.097]  That's public, that's declassified, that's in the WikiLeaks, that is not debatable.
[00:09:41.577 --> 00:09:42.737]  And all across the world,
[00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:46.150]  People are rejecting it.
[00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.652]  Look at these headlines.
[00:09:48.732 --> 00:09:53.556]  Trump praises populist Poland, says West must defend civilization and faith.
[00:09:54.957 --> 00:10:00.521]  Newsweek responds by calling it racist, bashes Trump for vowing to defend the West.
[00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:02.123]  You cannot.
[00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:04.608]  Make that up.
[00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:08.749]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson report quoting Newsweek.
[00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:11.169]  Now, who's really being racist here?
[00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:12.630]  Well, it's beyond racism.
[00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.450]  It's cultural divide.
[00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.611]  It's cultural manipulation.
[00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:27.513]  The truth is, it's Atlantic Monthly just yesterday that said Trump can't reverse the decline of white Christian America.
[00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:32.894]  And they go on to say Christianity is going down and so are white people.
[00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:40.079]  And this is from an elite, mainly white readership, East Coast publication.
[00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:44.560]  Because the elite want control, they don't want a free open society.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:54.263]  So they think they can bring in massive third world minority groups, make them the majority, and then fill them full of racial hatred using Hollywood systems of control.
[00:10:56.024 --> 00:11:02.126]  That go and open old wounds and magnify it and amplify it and build the pressure and the pressure and the pressure.
[00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:13.275]  So that they can get people to not want free market, not want freedom, but to just be racially based and then racially controlled.
[00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:21.220]  Amazing that they are that sickening when they engage in this type of behavior.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.964]  Meanwhile, Sweden has had so many mass rapes and anti-racism
[00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:31.043]  Events put on for the Muslims that they're now banning men at them.
[00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:31.903]  That's right.
[00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:35.485]  Bring in the Islamists that are 99% of the rapes in Europe, according to their own numbers.
[00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:38.106]  Make Sweden the rape capital of the world.
[00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:39.947]  Something happened last night in Sweden.
[00:11:39.987 --> 00:11:40.768]  Boy, Trump was right.
[00:11:40.788 --> 00:11:47.531]  There's all these countless videos online of them gang raping women, men lined up 10 deep, holding them down, raping them.
[00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:50.853]  And the police do nothing because that's politically incorrect.
[00:11:50.873 --> 00:11:56.916]  Just like in England, they won't stop the kidnapping and raping of little girls, predominantly by Muslims, because that's just their culture.
[00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:05.972]  Sweden holds man-free festival following spat of rapes and sex attacks that led to one event being cancelled.
[00:12:07.973 --> 00:12:12.797]  That's the New York Daily News, Daily Mail, they're all reporting on it.
[00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:15.039]  Of course, they're really pointing out that it's the Muslims.
[00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:16.940]  You don't dare do that.
[00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:21.564]  And then Trump, he has to be dealt with.
[00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:23.725]  He's so racist, he's so evil.
[00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:26.708]  Newsweek bashes Trump for vowing to defend the West.
[00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:28.118]  I think?
[00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:53.986]  Writing a triggering hit piece that claimed Trump didn't know what he was talking about.
[00:12:54.647 --> 00:13:03.769]  President Donald Trump just delivered a long speech in Warsaw, part Polish history lesson, part foreign policy address, part full-throated call to defend the West, whatever that might mean.
[00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.631]  You'd be forgiven for finding it a little confusing.
[00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:13.552]  No, Trump knows exactly what Atlantic Monthly and the elites have been writing for years.
[00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.593]  Trump can't reverse the decline of white Christian America.
[00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:18.174]  But see, that's for the elites to read.
[00:13:19.104 --> 00:13:24.567]  Because once they've got Christians out of the way, and Western civilization out of the way, it's nothing but third world total enslavement.
[00:13:25.527 --> 00:13:29.610]  But see, the Newsweek wants to play dumb and say they don't know what that really means.
[00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:36.913]  Let's hear from the President specifically on what he said yesterday, and then let's expand on that, because listen carefully.
[00:13:38.454 --> 00:13:47.399]  Poland, other than Serbia, and Hungary and Romania, but Poland more than probably any other nation in Eastern Europe,
[00:13:49.403 --> 00:13:54.147]  has stopped the Islamic invasion over a hundred times.
[00:13:54.867 --> 00:14:12.021]  The reason Polish women have those pretty cat eyes, a lot of them, and people like Melania, Eastern European, is because they've got a little Asian dashed in there, because that's what Arabs are, is a mix between Caucasian, black, and Asian.
[00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:14.063]  That's what Arabic is.
[00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:16.264]  That's what that group is.
[00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:17.966]  That's the crossroads of the world.
[00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:22.839]  And so Poland held off.
[00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:23.620]  Turkey didn't.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.041]  It became the seat of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:28.742]  Istanbul was previously Constantinople.
[00:14:28.982 --> 00:14:33.644]  Everyone goes and looks at the beautiful churches that are mosques now and says, oh, look at the incredible Islamic architecture.
[00:14:33.904 --> 00:14:35.185]  It's Christian architecture.
[00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:36.805]  It's Byzantine Empire.
[00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:38.966]  Holy Roman Empire architecture.
[00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:45.809]  Long after Rome fell in 410 to Visigoth chieftain Alaric, they moved it to the east.
[00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:49.077]  And then it fell to the Muslim invasion.
[00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.060]  The men were put to the sword.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.082]  The women were sold into slavery.
[00:14:56.667 --> 00:15:01.213]  And now, Erdogan is announcing a jihad to take down Europe for Islamification.
[00:15:01.594 --> 00:15:04.618]  And has pledged allegiance to ISIS and Al-Qaeda, basically.
[00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.729]  He's no longer the loving Muslim.
[00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:09.090]  He's no longer the friendly Muslim.
[00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.231]  Suddenly they're not just having little mustaches.
[00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:12.671]  Suddenly everybody's growing beards.
[00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.091]  Because it's time to uncloak.
[00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:16.292]  They've doubled their population in the last 20 years.
[00:15:16.592 --> 00:15:18.313]  It's time for Jihad!
[00:15:19.013 --> 00:15:22.634]  We have Democratic Party operatives at Hamas meetings in the U.S.
[00:15:23.454 --> 00:15:25.915]  openly saying it's Jihad on Donald Trump.
[00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:29.860]  It's the West that ended slavery in the West.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.102]  It's the West that was open to all groups.
[00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:32.782]  It's the West.
[00:15:32.822 --> 00:15:42.948]  And the hospitality of the West, our greatest strength, was used against us by Hollywood to focus in and exacerbate and open wounds and demonize problems that Christians tried to fix.
[00:15:43.388 --> 00:15:48.251]  When we are the best at open, free societies, the average American thinks we're the worst.
[00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.092]  They actually think North Korea is better.
[00:15:50.112 --> 00:15:51.473]  Many liberals do.
[00:15:51.773 --> 00:15:54.294]  Or Cuba, you know, for health care.
[00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:55.095]  They're idiots.
[00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:58.889]  So this is the takeover.
[00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:08.455]  If you're a cold-blooded globalist, on average, you don't even have children, don't care about a future, you make a short-term deal with the giant third-world populations that you've already exploited and used.
[00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:09.636]  Now that's collapsing.
[00:16:09.776 --> 00:16:16.541]  Flood the West, drive down wages, and then fill them full of militant class envy with a nice icing of racism.
[00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:21.324]  And then when people finally see it and say, let's not do this, you jump on them and say they're racist.
[00:16:21.984 --> 00:16:25.767]  Here is President Trump to a hero's welcome in Poland.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:38.988]  Now among the most committed members of the NATO alliance, Poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong, whole, and free.
[00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:44.932]  A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and they know that.
[00:16:44.952 --> 00:16:50.056]  A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.
[00:16:56.261 --> 00:17:10.132]  100 years after the entry of American forces into World War I, the transatlantic bond between the United States and Europe is as strong as ever, and maybe in many ways even stronger.
[00:17:11.293 --> 00:17:18.619]  This continent no longer confronts the specter of communism, but today we're in the West
[00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:27.419]  And we have to say, there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life.
[00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:29.400]  You see what's happening out there?
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.040]  They are threats.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.261]  We will confront them.
[00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:34.621]  We will win.
[00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:36.502]  But they are threats.
[00:17:40.203 --> 00:17:41.063]  We will have victory.
[00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.183]  It's the spirit.
[00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.544]  And we have the will, the history, and the capacity.
[00:17:49.753 --> 00:17:52.855]  This seems radical to Hollywood because all it is is sanity returning.
[00:17:57.478 --> 00:18:18.010]  We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense
[00:18:19.235 --> 00:18:20.957]  Of civilization itself.
[00:18:23.499 --> 00:18:27.762]  Alright, that is one of the only things I've ever heard Donald Trump say that is patently not true.
[00:18:30.084 --> 00:18:30.865]  That last little part.
[00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:38.371]  It's been Russia on the front lines, just like Poland, for over 1,400 years fighting Islam and holding the line.
[00:18:38.912 --> 00:18:42.195]  Serbia, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, countries.
[00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:43.035]  That's the front line.
[00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:44.857]  That's where the invasion stopped.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.303]  And then the globalists running America, as Trump knows, have been financing the Islamic invasion all over the world.
[00:18:51.523 --> 00:18:58.247]  The EU has opened up its borders, is flooding in 80% military-age men to engage in cultural and physical jihad.
[00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:15.218]  And then Soros goes and overthrows Ukraine, starts a war with Russia, and Trump comes out and basically reverses what he said in the campaign and says that, you know, Russia needs to join the community and help us fight for civilization.
[00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:23.293]  That's like if Russia just won the Super Bowl of fighting Muslims and radical Muslims in Syrian places and then you tell them they need to learn how to play football.
[00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:26.153]  And I'm not here to defend Russia, I'm here to defend reality.
[00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:27.874]  This is very cut and dry.
[00:19:27.894 --> 00:19:31.974]  Now I understand he's doing this as a negotiation going in with Putin tomorrow.
[00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:34.295]  So at a Machiavelli level I get what Trump's doing.
[00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:36.135]  At a chess level I get it.
[00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:38.776]  But Trump's strength is not playing Machiavelli.
[00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:44.729]  And it also gets his detractors, and he's a Russian agent, folks, off his back.
[00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:45.930]  So he knows what he's doing.
[00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.412]  In fact, it's a stroke of genius politically.
[00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:53.157]  It's just that his real strength has been telling it like it is, right out in the open.
[00:19:53.638 --> 00:20:00.885]  Now to see him engage in this Machiavellian left hook, it's one of the first times we've seen little Beelzebub.
[00:20:14.554 --> 00:20:26.636]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:43.479]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:58.037]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[00:20:59.098 --> 00:21:06.061]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[00:21:06.943 --> 00:21:09.824]  That our species has never even imagined.
[00:21:10.664 --> 00:21:17.747]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[00:21:18.107 --> 00:21:28.050]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.132]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:36.213]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:51.400]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, the people of the world.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:22:01.887]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:05.690]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:09.636]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[00:22:10.636 --> 00:22:14.898]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[00:22:15.258 --> 00:22:16.178]  It's why they hate me.
[00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:17.319]  It's why they hate you.
[00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:20.360]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:26.463]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[00:22:27.023 --> 00:22:32.225]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.342]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[00:22:37.842 --> 00:22:40.723]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:47.206]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[00:22:47.707 --> 00:22:54.810]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.461]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:03.726]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbridge Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[00:23:04.386 --> 00:23:10.051]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:16.295]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:19.278]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:21.559]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[00:23:26.252 --> 00:23:29.113]  Long lasting sale in the history of Infowars.
[00:23:29.794 --> 00:23:38.077]  Because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[00:23:38.478 --> 00:23:41.479]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together.
[00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:44.681]  Because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:51.844]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[00:23:52.384 --> 00:23:54.145]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[00:24:17.188 --> 00:24:25.131]  You know, there's all these folks that want to merge us with the Middle East and want to merge us with North Africa.
[00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:32.274]  But everybody's trying to get out of the Middle East and get out of North Africa, and the populations are doubling every 20 years.
[00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:35.775]  Now, I don't want to go in there and Bill Gates them with a bunch of poison vaccines.
[00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:43.879]  But at the same time, the globalists are using those populations to absolutely create degradation.
[00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:49.861]  I mean, you go to France, you go to Italy, you go to Greece, it looks like a war zone in every town, every city.
[00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:51.661]  It is a nightmare.
[00:24:51.701 --> 00:25:03.604]  In fact, I've shown some of this, but I really want to get the crew to put together a reel of videos, just from lately, of folks driving through the forest in France, and you see people suddenly like climbing, like out of some movie,
[00:25:04.424 --> 00:25:08.027]  Out of the woods and dropping trees in front of the car and then robbing everybody.
[00:25:09.088 --> 00:25:15.093]  And then just pulling over whole groups of trucks and beating everybody up and just robbing the vehicles and driving off in them.
[00:25:15.353 --> 00:25:16.514]  And nothing's being done.
[00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:19.176]  I mean, why would Europe do that?
[00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:23.240]  There's new video.
[00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:36.145]  of Austria panicking and deploying armored vehicles and tens of thousands of troops to their border with Italy, where Muslims are marching across 6,000 a day, it's being reported, by Austria.
[00:25:36.845 --> 00:25:37.885]  Just at one crossing.
[00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:45.627]  And the Italians won't stop them, so they've put troops on the border, and Italy is saying you need to remove them.
[00:25:47.147 --> 00:25:49.287]  You need to let this happen.
[00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:52.708]  I mean, a year ago, France declared a civil
[00:25:55.063 --> 00:25:55.963]  Emergency!
[00:26:02.726 --> 00:26:09.089]  And the roads are under martial law, and now Macron is declaring martial law.
[00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:17.192]  He's declared martial law powers, not since the end of World War II have those been in power, and has declared himself the God Jupiter.
[00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:22.954]  His presidential office said, I will rule like the God Jupiter.
[00:26:25.558 --> 00:26:26.719]  Talk about insanity.
[00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:28.761]  Just bringing in millions.
[00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:30.462]  10 million Muslims in Europe.
[00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:33.645]  10 million.
[00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.167]  I thought it was 5 million in the last few years.
[00:26:36.267 --> 00:26:38.749]  It's 10 million according to the UN.
[00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:39.990]  10 million!
[00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.612]  Just running around insanely.
[00:26:45.776 --> 00:26:48.501]  They're having to close outdoor events because of the mass raping.
[00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:53.150]  They poop in the public pools and no one's trying to rehabilitate them or wake them up.
[00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:55.274]  They're saying you must adopt their culture.
[00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:05.940]  Well, why doesn't Linda Sarsour, big Democrat, big SJW, big Soros-funded lady, at a Hamas fundraiser, says she's fighting Trump as jihad?
[00:27:06.401 --> 00:27:10.105]  Lady, why don't you go to a Muslim country where they don't even let women speak in public?
[00:27:10.406 --> 00:27:15.651]  Why don't you go put a beekeeper outfit on and go get your genitals cut off overseas if you love it so much?
[00:27:16.564 --> 00:27:20.126]  The globalist headline will be, Jones wants Linda Susser's genitals cut off.
[00:27:20.146 --> 00:27:20.847]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:27.091]  I said, they're having 5,000 plus women a year illegally having their genitals cut off in England alone, they've discovered.
[00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:28.552]  It's spreading all over the place.
[00:27:28.832 --> 00:27:31.334]  I'm saying if you love it so much, go there.
[00:27:31.474 --> 00:27:41.240]  Don't come here and then run around in your Halloween costumes and tell the rest of us that just want to be prosperous that we're the problem.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.342]  You're the problem, not us.
[00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.423]  It's a culture issue.
[00:27:48.012 --> 00:27:50.173]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip of Linda Sarsour.
[00:27:50.914 --> 00:27:56.977]  Sisters and brothers, it's been 16, almost 17 years since the horrific attacks of 9-11.
[00:27:57.518 --> 00:28:02.821]  And we still as a community find ourselves unprepared in so many moments.
[00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:05.282]  Why, sisters and brothers, why are we so unprepared?
[00:28:05.342 --> 00:28:11.466]  Why are we so afraid of this administration and the potential chaos that they will ensue on our community?
[00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:13.187]  And we already saw their potential
[00:28:13.507 --> 00:28:29.328]  When they come out every few weeks, Muslim Ban 1, Muslim Ban 2, Muslim Ban 3, they are relentless, they are persistent and consistent and want to see how much we as a community can endure and want to see who our friends are and how hard we're going to fight back against this administration.
[00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:37.732]  That we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad.
[00:28:38.072 --> 00:28:50.635]  That we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or in the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.
[00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:52.576]  Oh, white supremacists.
[00:28:53.036 --> 00:28:54.456]  How many are those out there?
[00:28:54.636 --> 00:28:55.157]  Who are they killing?
[00:28:55.177 --> 00:28:55.677]  Who are they murdering?
[00:28:55.697 --> 00:28:56.637]  Are they throwing gays off buildings?
[00:28:57.281 --> 00:29:02.945]  That we as a Muslim community in these United States of America have to be perpetually outraged every single day.
[00:29:02.965 --> 00:29:07.708]  When I wake up in the morning and I remember who's sitting in the White House, I am outraged.
[00:29:07.728 --> 00:29:10.709]  Yeah, Linda Sarsour is totally fun about Zoros.
[00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.251]  She ran the Women's March in D.C.
[00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:15.312]  This country is not normal.
[00:29:15.593 --> 00:29:25.319]  So do not ever be those citizens that normalize this administration because when the day comes that something horrific happens to us or to another community,
[00:29:26.013 --> 00:29:26.533]  I'd shut her up.
[00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:27.874]  I can't listen anymore to that liar.
[00:29:28.494 --> 00:29:35.497]  She won't condemn the acid attacks, the women having their genitals cut off, the gays being thrown off buildings, any of it.
[00:29:36.598 --> 00:29:36.958]  Any of it.
[00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:40.620]  Pro-life feminists aren't allowed to march into those deals, but the Muslim women aren't.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.002]  I mean, it's just the most sickening evil group, using the fact that we're so tolerant to run all over us.
[00:29:46.142 --> 00:29:46.662]  Well, guess what?
[00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:47.903]  We're awake now, witch!
[00:29:48.263 --> 00:29:50.244]  So enjoy your little Hamas meeting, witch!
[00:29:50.504 --> 00:29:51.765]  We see you, witch!
[00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:55.726]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.647 --> 00:29:59.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.551]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:18.375]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[00:30:18.596 --> 00:30:19.496]  A total classic.
[00:30:19.716 --> 00:30:30.345]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:36.070]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:36.430]  You see,
[00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.054]  Given a fair examination of the president's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[00:30:41.234 --> 00:30:51.785]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[00:30:52.045 --> 00:30:54.367]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[00:30:54.547 --> 00:30:56.169]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:59.032]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:03.806 --> 00:31:07.347]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:07.807 --> 00:31:13.848]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:17.029]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:20.430]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.071]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:24.411 --> 00:31:24.851]  The left
[00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:27.132]  This T-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[00:31:54.122 --> 00:31:57.290]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.054]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:31:59.214 --> 00:32:00.397]  It's available right now.
[00:32:00.697 --> 00:32:02.903]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.

[00:33:10.523 --> 00:33:14.364]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.384 --> 00:33:18.765]  Let the great meme war of 2017 begin and let the fall of MSN become complete.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.860]  I'm good.
[00:34:11.206 --> 00:34:12.748]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:14.470]  CNN is fake news.
[00:34:15.451 --> 00:34:15.991]  Ha ha!
[00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:21.757]  I tell you, Walker and McBreen and the rest of the great crew are making some great memes.
[00:34:22.158 --> 00:34:33.110]  If you just joined us, obviously memes are little short videos, graphics, images, that in I'd say less than 10 to 15 words or images, tell a story.
[00:34:34.249 --> 00:34:48.128]  Like Trump as Luke Skywalker, his face superimposed over Luke Skywalker in Episode 4, flying the trench, firing the torpedoes down the reactor shaft and destroying the Death Star, which is replaced by the symbol of CNN.
[00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:50.890]  We literally mean we want to blow up CNN.
[00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.332]  We don't want any violence against them.
[00:34:52.832 --> 00:34:55.514]  We're not calling for active rioting like Newsweek or Time.
[00:34:55.814 --> 00:35:00.158]  We're not calling for killing the president or killing members of Congress or hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:08.325]  We're simply saying we have free speech to show the president metaphorically in battle, in hand-to-hand combat, defeating you.
[00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:17.726]  And we don't like you, and we don't appreciate you, and we know you're a pack of liars who were down almost 95% in your ratings in the last decade.
[00:35:17.746 --> 00:35:21.570]  They've had a small dead cat bounce, but even that's going down right now.
[00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:36.142]  Before I go any further into all the big news, I started a $200,000 contest about a month ago that Mike Cernovich had the idea to do to say basically CNN is terrorists when Kathy Griffin put out the severed head bloody image of Trump to push that whole meme.
[00:35:38.092 --> 00:35:40.114]  And we've paid out, I guess, like 20 grand of it.
[00:35:40.134 --> 00:35:40.935]  Folks have done a great job.
[00:35:40.955 --> 00:35:48.963]  But CNN and other live TV, they've been really sequestering themselves in a fortress mentality behind closed doors.
[00:35:49.403 --> 00:35:51.686]  Because you have to legally and lawfully get live on TV.
[00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:55.329]  They've got to be outside to do it and say, Infowars.com, CNN's fake news.
[00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:01.856]  Hit the 2500, just show CNN is fake news or CNN is ISIS to hit the thousand.
[00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:05.827]  And we just do it to have some fun.
[00:36:05.907 --> 00:36:17.957]  But that whole CNN is ISIS meme that Cernovich thought of, but CNN promotes ISIS and Arab Spring and division and open borders, so, you know, the shoe certainly fits.
[00:36:18.538 --> 00:36:27.505]  And the general public had pushed that fact that they're ISIS and supporting ISIS, but Cernovich had the idea for the contest, and then I thought, let's expand it to CNN is very fake news.
[00:36:28.499 --> 00:36:33.524]  Let's expand it to just showing CNN doing any fake newscast, which they've been caught several times doing.
[00:36:33.904 --> 00:36:45.615]  Basically rewarding people for being in the info war and just focusing on CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, and really consciously recognizing what frauds they are.
[00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:51.453]  And also to finance that $200,000 contest, we've come up with like 10 different t-shirts now.
[00:36:51.493 --> 00:36:52.554]  They're all limited edition.
[00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:54.274]  We're only doing one run of each.
[00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:56.695]  This one is on really nice soft fabric.
[00:36:57.176 --> 00:36:58.736]  CNN is fake news.
[00:36:59.857 --> 00:37:01.857]  Pretty much everybody agrees on that, like 90%.
[00:37:02.558 --> 00:37:04.319]  On the right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:08.680]  And on the back, InfoWars is real news.
[00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:10.661]  You will meet like-minded people.
[00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:12.062]  You will spread the word.
[00:37:12.342 --> 00:37:14.343]  These aren't as incendiary as Trump shirts.
[00:37:15.202 --> 00:37:17.745]  Probably get your dinner bought for you in conservative or libertarian areas.
[00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:20.127]  Might get attacked in Berkeley or downtown Austin.
[00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:24.592]  But this is a limited edition CNN is fake news shirt.
[00:37:25.073 --> 00:37:26.314]  InfoWars is real news.
[00:37:26.655 --> 00:37:31.860]  This personally is my favorite shirt of the ten or so different ones that we've put out.
[00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:36.225]  But they're all limited edition available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:37:38.849 --> 00:37:44.671]  Out of the $200,000, there's a lot of money for us, but it's worth it to get the word out and create a meme that could bring down the globalists.
[00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:50.433]  I mean, just Bill Clinton's rapist operation was on national TV hundreds of times.
[00:37:51.153 --> 00:38:00.096]  Trump and others believe it was probably one of the deciding factors that didn't let them claim Trump was a predator with no evidence, when there's Bill Clinton in plain view.
[00:38:00.496 --> 00:38:02.517]  Bill Clinton and Hillary are sexual predators.
[00:38:02.557 --> 00:38:03.697]  She covers up for predators.
[00:38:04.018 --> 00:38:05.078]  He is a known predator.
[00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:08.959]  They wanted to project their weakness onto Trump.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.161]  We projected reality back on him.
[00:38:12.342 --> 00:38:13.822]  So a shield for Trump.
[00:38:14.503 --> 00:38:16.964]  They want to say he's a Russian agent because they're on the Russian payroll.
[00:38:18.525 --> 00:38:19.286]  That's collapsing.
[00:38:19.546 --> 00:38:22.308]  Whatever they do, they blame us, okay?
[00:38:24.304 --> 00:38:29.929]  And so now, if we really push this CNN is terrorist, CNN is fake news, in the info war, it's over!
[00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.032]  And quite frankly, you see it manifesting through memes.
[00:38:33.532 --> 00:38:35.054]  You see it happening through memes.
[00:38:35.094 --> 00:38:42.400]  A lot of folks are calling it ISIS and calling them fake news and all the rest of it, without even knowing where all of that basically came from.
[00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:46.384]  This is such an exciting time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.026]  So we're announcing a $20,000 chunk
[00:38:51.325 --> 00:38:53.366]  That'll be paid next Wednesday.
[00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:54.586]  Paul Watson's running it.
[00:38:54.866 --> 00:38:55.726]  He's in the email.
[00:38:56.106 --> 00:38:57.187]  Our great InfoWars editor.
[00:38:57.427 --> 00:38:58.207]  He's in the email.
[00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:00.768]  Contest at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.408]  And there's a lot of different ways to win the prize.
[00:39:03.528 --> 00:39:05.849]  If I think you, you know, you win, you win.
[00:39:06.649 --> 00:39:07.770]  If I don't think you do, you don't.
[00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.790]  But I want to pay out.
[00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.730]  I want to do this.
[00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:11.691]  I want to see victory.
[00:39:11.971 --> 00:39:12.931]  I want to see success.
[00:39:13.311 --> 00:39:19.873]  Well, now $20,000 chunk out of that is going to one winner that makes the best
[00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:27.134]  Trump CNN meme that has Infowars.com, myself, Paul Watson, I don't care.
[00:39:27.394 --> 00:39:30.916]  Promote Infowars, promote freedom, promote the true independent press.
[00:39:32.296 --> 00:39:34.738]  Let folks know that your free speech doesn't end when they're offended.
[00:39:35.198 --> 00:39:40.600]  Practice the First Amendment, just like the Second Amendment, so they can't eradicate it and shun it and demonize it.
[00:39:42.241 --> 00:39:42.901]  And you will win $20,000.
[00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:46.743]  Paul Watson is going to be tweeting these.
[00:39:46.883 --> 00:39:49.645]  He's going to be writing about these memes that come in.
[00:39:50.635 --> 00:39:57.359]  Unfortunately, our own crew, I think, is not eligible to be in this contest.
[00:39:57.379 --> 00:40:01.842]  They've already made some amazing ones, but I may have some private awards for some of the folks here in the office.
[00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:03.764]  But bottom line, be part of this.
[00:40:04.104 --> 00:40:05.365]  It could be a 30-second meme.
[00:40:05.405 --> 00:40:06.846]  It could be a five-minute mini-film.
[00:40:07.146 --> 00:40:08.807]  It could be, you know, just an image.
[00:40:09.107 --> 00:40:11.929]  Whatever that iconic thing is, Paul Watson is the judge.
[00:40:12.249 --> 00:40:18.113]  The judge alone, $20,000, and the contest has really got people
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.622]  Excited right now.
[00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:26.985]  So, they want to try to target some guy, have him come out and say he's racist and bad.
[00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:29.567]  Turns out that was a fake person, probably made up by CNN.
[00:40:29.907 --> 00:40:35.671]  It was a Hispanic guy, reportedly now, who was 16 years old, in Mexico, that made the funny meme.
[00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:40.875]  Mexico loves boxing, loves wrestling, loves memes, loves comedy, just like anybody else does.
[00:40:41.135 --> 00:40:43.257]  They tried to make it racist, make it evil, make it hurtful.
[00:40:43.517 --> 00:40:44.338]  The whole thing was fake.
[00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:48.280]  They intimidated an imaginary person to show them buckling to CNN.
[00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:54.349]  Bullying and psychological extortion and terrorism and racketeering.
[00:40:54.729 --> 00:40:55.889]  That blew up in their face.
[00:40:55.909 --> 00:41:00.131]  And of course we learned, as I predicted, that it again was completely fake.
[00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:02.851]  But whatever you do, get the limited edition shirts.
[00:41:03.392 --> 00:41:05.112]  There's been like 10 or 11 designs.
[00:41:05.232 --> 00:41:06.613]  Two or three of them are already sold out.
[00:41:07.053 --> 00:41:08.553]  This is the best design I believe.
[00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:09.654]  CNN is fake news.
[00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:10.974]  Designed by yours truly.
[00:41:11.394 --> 00:41:13.255]  On the back, Infowars is real news.
[00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:21.784]  And we've got one run of these that just got in on the 18-wheeler today, and when it's gone, it's gone.
[00:41:21.924 --> 00:41:23.866]  Limited edition shirt, available.
[00:41:24.206 --> 00:41:25.788]  By the way, it's on expensive fabric.
[00:41:26.308 --> 00:41:28.711]  It cost us $10 to make this shirt.
[00:41:30.273 --> 00:41:33.715]  So, that gives you, most shirts are like $2, $3, you know, and then they sell them for $9.95.
[00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:36.377]  This is, this is like $10.00 a print, this is really nice fabric.
[00:41:37.698 --> 00:41:52.768]  Infowarsstore.com, your purchase helps fund this meme contest, and you see what we're doing, you see how you're changing the world, taking action, and then we're creating the talking points based on common sense, Americana, that is being picked up by the entire world!
[00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:54.649]  I talk to folks that go overseas.
[00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.552]  And they come back and they say, Alex, there's InfoWars stickers everywhere.
[00:41:59.772 --> 00:42:01.614]  People are wearing InfoWars shirts that are homemade.
[00:42:02.214 --> 00:42:04.676]  You know, Roger Stone said he got mobbed.
[00:42:05.417 --> 00:42:07.278]  Off record, he told me some interesting stuff.
[00:42:07.618 --> 00:42:10.881]  But on record, he got mobbed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:11.261 --> 00:42:17.746]  And he was meeting with the heads of state and foreign governments, you know, major leadership, and they were, you know, say hi to Alex Jones.
[00:42:18.086 --> 00:42:21.428]  And again, it's not a power trip to say that.
[00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:25.391]  It's the reality so you know the fact that Americana
[00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:26.391]  And
[00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:54.949]  Threatening to release the identity of someone if they didn't promise to ever not criticize CNN again, if they didn't promise to politically never be involved again.
[00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.771]  That's called terrorism.
[00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:58.253]  That's called racketeering.
[00:42:58.293 --> 00:43:06.862]  That's called violating federal and state law by these sniveling, third-string, drooling, humpty-dumpty morons.
[00:43:07.443 --> 00:43:24.857]  These teleprompter reading followers at what is the Clinton News Network, the Communist News Network, the Corleone News Network, the Coward News Network, the Corleone News Network.
[00:43:25.157 --> 00:43:27.339]  Let's go ahead and play the clip from the President.
[00:43:28.027 --> 00:43:28.227]  I think?
[00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:47.942]  Unfortunately for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems.
[00:43:49.264 --> 00:43:51.446]  They have been fake news for a long time.
[00:43:51.506 --> 00:43:56.630]  They've been covering me in a very dishonest way.
[00:43:57.351 --> 00:43:59.373]  Do you have that also, by the way, Mr. President?
[00:44:00.643 --> 00:44:09.331]  With CNN and others, I mean, I know, NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.
[00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:18.899]  But I will say that CNN has really taken it too seriously, and I think they've hurt themselves very badly, very, very badly.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.324]  And what we want to see in the United States is honest, beautiful, free,
[00:44:25.325 --> 00:44:26.246]  But honest press.
[00:44:26.286 --> 00:44:27.407]  We want to see fair press.
[00:44:27.447 --> 00:44:28.748]  I think it's a very important thing.
[00:44:29.168 --> 00:44:30.369]  We don't want fake news.
[00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:32.751]  And by the way, not everybody is fake news.
[00:44:33.531 --> 00:44:34.672]  But we don't want fake news.
[00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:35.793]  Bad thing.
[00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.054]  Very bad for our country.
[00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:40.696]  How could I be so stupid?
[00:44:43.759 --> 00:44:46.501]  You played me.
[00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:47.701]  You played me.
[00:44:48.482 --> 00:44:49.403]  Wait a minute.
[00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:56.171]  All of this is a well-orchestrated plan!
[00:44:57.752 --> 00:44:59.293]  You've got to love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:01.254 --> 00:45:03.054]  And already he's trying to turn the economy around.
[00:45:03.395 --> 00:45:06.416]  Foxconn's announcing it wants to move factories back to the United States.
[00:45:06.456 --> 00:45:07.697]  That's the Apple slave factories.
[00:45:09.237 --> 00:45:10.938]  The robots haven't turned out so good for him.
[00:45:11.678 --> 00:45:13.419]  They tried to replace the poor Chinese workers with.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.782]  But the economy is slowing in new jobs in some places, like Ron Paul said months ago here.
[00:45:19.162 --> 00:45:20.903]  He said Trump's doing a great job on the economy.
[00:45:23.814 --> 00:45:26.056]  Starting to see Ron Paul more and more cheerlead for Trump.
[00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:27.897]  But he said, I think it's too little too late.
[00:45:27.937 --> 00:45:30.239]  The globalists want to kill the economy to stop Trump.
[00:45:30.499 --> 00:45:31.660]  And they admit they're doing that.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.343]  I mean, they're in Atlantic Monthly, the most elite globalist publication in America.
[00:45:36.363 --> 00:45:37.564]  I mean, that's the talking points.
[00:45:38.144 --> 00:45:39.985]  How they want to COG overthrow Trump.
[00:45:40.005 --> 00:45:41.627]  How they want to suspend the last election.
[00:45:41.987 --> 00:45:46.650]  How they want to have the Democrats permanently with Homeland Security over elections like Venezuela or Cuba.
[00:45:48.471 --> 00:45:50.293]  I mean, this is so over the top, I can't even believe it.
[00:45:57.847 --> 00:46:03.008]  Now they're coming out saying the West will fall, Christianity will fall, white people are evil.
[00:46:03.048 --> 00:46:07.049]  It's like, what super ultra racism crud is this?
[00:46:08.529 --> 00:46:10.050]  And it's meant to divide everybody into groups.
[00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:11.050]  How do you control a prison?
[00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:18.251]  You have the Hispanic area, the white area, the black area, and if it's on the East Coast or West Coast, in a big city with a lot of Asians, an Asian area.
[00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:20.112]  They'll break it in three to four groups.
[00:46:20.472 --> 00:46:21.672]  That's how you manage people.
[00:46:23.319 --> 00:46:24.079]  And that's a fact.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.240]  And I don't want to be in a big prison.
[00:46:26.621 --> 00:46:29.662]  I don't want to be in my gated neighborhood, scared of everybody.
[00:46:30.963 --> 00:46:35.925]  I want to see upwardly mobile people in the middle class and wealthy neighborhoods of every race, color, and creed.
[00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:38.766]  And by the way, you see that all over the country now.
[00:46:38.986 --> 00:46:40.867]  And people get along, and they have fun.
[00:46:41.768 --> 00:46:43.489]  And their sons and daughters love each other.
[00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:45.129]  That's another thing.
[00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.831]  You see, they push multiculturalism, but it was actually working.
[00:46:49.211 --> 00:46:52.173]  People were getting along, so now they've come in and just invoked all this division.
[00:46:53.168 --> 00:47:02.050]  Then they claim Trump, they claim Trump is the one creating all this division, when they're the ones pushing and calling for all the over-the-top garbage.
[00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:20.153]  I mean, I cannot get over earlier, Linda Sarsour, the big Soros-funded Islamist, and you've got the owner of Shabani Yogurt, who's on the Federal Reserve Board of New York City, the one that runs the whole country, just all these foreigners running our country, it's just absolutely sick!
[00:47:20.953 --> 00:47:22.453]  But see, in Muslim countries,
[00:47:25.122 --> 00:47:29.284]  3,000 years ago, the Sahara was maybe 10% of the size it is, okay, North Africa.
[00:47:29.804 --> 00:47:33.945]  There were crocodiles, you know, in the middle of the Sahara Desert, where the Sahara Desert is today.
[00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:36.206]  There were horses.
[00:47:36.246 --> 00:47:37.066]  There were zebras.
[00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:39.967]  It was jungly in many areas.
[00:47:40.507 --> 00:47:44.669]  And then the desertification began.
[00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:45.769]  I'm going into some history here.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:49.052]  And there were all these populations and peoples.
[00:47:49.592 --> 00:47:52.873]  There were Africans, and there were Asians, and there were Caucasians.
[00:47:53.193 --> 00:48:02.956]  All these tribes warring and fighting over the green fields of the promised land that was North Africa, and Eastern Africa, and the Middle East.
[00:48:03.197 --> 00:48:04.837]  There were some desert areas, but not a lot.
[00:48:05.237 --> 00:48:15.341]  But just like Texas, when the German, and Polish, and Czech, and Irish, and Scottish, mainly Scottish immigrants came in, there was six-foot grass everywhere, except in far West Texas.
[00:48:16.681 --> 00:48:18.281]  There's only about two inches of black soil.
[00:48:18.702 --> 00:48:20.322]  The cows ate it down and eroded.
[00:48:20.562 --> 00:48:28.284]  Goats came in, ate it down, and then now it's desert in about a third of the Texas that wasn't arid desert before.
[00:48:28.765 --> 00:48:29.905]  And the state's turning desert.
[00:48:30.705 --> 00:48:33.006]  And the desert's marching towards the east.
[00:48:33.866 --> 00:48:34.826]  That just happened in 160, 170 years.
[00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:38.362]  Same thing.
[00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:48.027]  So all these populations from Asia and Africa and what's Europe today were just in there interbreeding, warring, slaving, killing.
[00:48:48.047 --> 00:48:54.310]  I mean, they've dug up Caucasian skeletons in China from 10,000 years ago.
[00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.371]  They've dug them up in Africa.
[00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:56.611]  It was just a free-for-all.
[00:48:57.972 --> 00:48:59.413]  And so that created the Arabs.
[00:49:01.203 --> 00:49:01.744]  That's what they are.
[00:49:01.764 --> 00:49:07.851]  They test their DNA, they are African, they are Asian, and they are Caucasian.
[00:49:09.173 --> 00:49:12.497]  But for the last 3,000 years or so, it's been desert.
[00:49:13.758 --> 00:49:20.667]  And so then it wasn't about economy anymore, it was all about murdering, slaving, killing, politically taking over, and inbreeding.
[00:49:22.236 --> 00:49:40.530]  And so you've got a third war, a third world war zone, a stone age cultures and populations that come out of slavery, war, caravans, kidnapping, mass murder, thuggies, all the way, we get the word thug, all the way from India right into North Africa, just murdering and killing.
[00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.912]  That's where you get the word thug, folks, the thuggy.
[00:49:45.514 --> 00:49:49.737]  Child kidnapping, devil worship, just every whacked out thing you could imagine.
[00:49:51.886 --> 00:50:04.072]  And now it got taken over by Islam 1400 years ago, but it all has that in its genetics and its roots, and now it's being brought in, and it's not about working, it's not about having a job, it's about politically taking over.
[00:50:04.632 --> 00:50:05.772]  And that's what the Muslims do.
[00:50:06.573 --> 00:50:09.014]  And I'm sorry, they think I'm stupid, I'm not.
[00:50:09.034 --> 00:50:13.856]  A lot of Muslims want to be Americans, they want to be heretics, they want to be free, I get it, I'm all for that.
[00:50:15.277 --> 00:50:19.699]  But the first waves of the doctors and the scientists and the refugees from Islam, they were great people.
[00:50:20.592 --> 00:50:21.512]  We're not getting that now.
[00:50:21.572 --> 00:50:27.715]  We're getting folks that don't know what planet they're on, and it is dangerous.
[00:50:28.056 --> 00:50:29.296]  And they've declared jihad.
[00:50:29.636 --> 00:50:46.865]  Ergun, the dictator of Turkey, bordering Europe, has declared jihad and has threatened to burn every city in Europe down, and is now activating his Islamic forces, and told Germany, I'm gonna fly in during the G20, and I'm gonna speak to the Muslims, and they said no.
[00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:53.336]  I mean, again, even the Muslims are now double-crossing the EU that sold Europe out early.
[00:50:53.356 --> 00:50:58.803]  They're like, Ergun, you were supposed to sell us out in your son's time, and then kill all the men and take the women.
[00:50:58.843 --> 00:51:01.086]  And Ergun goes, we will take them now.
[00:51:01.166 --> 00:51:02.428]  His top imams are saying that.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.141]  I'm not saying this to put a good face on him.
[00:51:10.321 --> 00:51:14.143]  For this time in the summer, we have the highest ratings we've ever had.
[00:51:14.603 --> 00:51:15.324]  That's the truth.
[00:51:15.644 --> 00:51:16.384]  It isn't me.
[00:51:16.805 --> 00:51:17.525]  It's Lionel.
[00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:18.566]  It's all the guests.
[00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:22.108]  It's because we are credible that they don't like it and they want it shut down.
[00:51:22.188 --> 00:51:24.809]  So when they want to censor Alex, they want to censor you.
[00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:26.250]  Lionel, what's really behind this?
[00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:27.792]  Let me explain something to you.
[00:51:28.312 --> 00:51:35.321]  Nobody has any idea of the power of not only you, but your movement, and what this is saying.
[00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:37.203]  Nobody understands that.
[00:51:37.464 --> 00:51:43.611]  Now, another thing too is, let me just also bring up, if you wanted to catch you, because believe it or not,
[00:51:44.732 --> 00:51:48.054]  It would have been better had she done what I suggested.
[00:51:48.414 --> 00:51:50.415]  Let her just ask you to speak.
[00:51:50.755 --> 00:51:57.339]  I would have done something like, Mr. Jones, tell me what it feels like to be the leader of a revolution.
[00:51:57.679 --> 00:51:58.019]  Tell me.
[00:51:58.399 --> 00:52:00.200]  I would have known your catchphrases.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.641]  I would have lowered your guard.
[00:52:02.961 --> 00:52:04.182]  I would have brought out.
[00:52:04.422 --> 00:52:06.083]  It's just like hostage negotiation.
[00:52:06.363 --> 00:52:09.026]  You tell somebody, I understand your plight.
[00:52:09.386 --> 00:52:11.028]  I understand they don't respect you.
[00:52:11.368 --> 00:52:14.311]  Then I would have said, folks, run the camera.
[00:52:14.552 --> 00:52:15.112]  Let it go.
[00:52:15.452 --> 00:52:26.544]  But what she did was because you knew these answers, because you never said anything that she thought you said, because you merely brought up things which she's
[00:52:26.544 --> 00:52:30.306]  You know Alex, we live in a world right now where we hate the notion of plagiarism.
[00:52:52.799 --> 00:52:55.783]  And there's an old expression that says, if you steal from one, it's plagiarism.
[00:52:56.084 --> 00:52:57.826]  If you steal from a bunch, it's called research.
[00:52:58.287 --> 00:52:59.889]  But you know what's worse than plagiarism?
[00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:01.932]  What's worse than taking somebody's idea?
[00:53:02.292 --> 00:53:05.236]  It's taking somebody's idea and removing it.
[00:53:05.977 --> 00:53:06.999]  Making it synthetic.
[00:53:07.339 --> 00:53:08.581]  Making it false.
[00:53:08.701 --> 00:53:09.703]  Building a straw man.
[00:53:10.805 --> 00:53:11.486]  Precisely.
[00:53:11.886 --> 00:53:15.069]  So what she did was, you can say, how dare you?
[00:53:15.689 --> 00:53:20.934]  You know, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Megan, I knew you were going to do a hatchet job on me.
[00:53:21.054 --> 00:53:21.875]  I understood that.
[00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:23.976]  But I must have been naive.
[00:53:24.497 --> 00:53:34.806]  I would have thought you and this august organization known as NBC would have had the common decency to let me merely say what I wanted to say.
[00:53:35.046 --> 00:53:36.467]  Do you think Kelly survives?
[00:53:36.567 --> 00:53:44.572]  Because, I don't mean to be mean, but she's aging rapidly, but she's such a cold person, and people don't like her, and her ratings are going down.
[00:53:45.253 --> 00:53:47.254]  This was the nail in the coffin.
[00:53:47.314 --> 00:53:50.176]  This precipitated that which was the inevitable.
[00:53:50.577 --> 00:53:51.737]  She wasn't working.
[00:53:52.058 --> 00:53:53.579]  Nobody at NBC wanted her.
[00:53:53.999 --> 00:53:58.062]  And so now she's gonna get big ratings, but it's like the Death Star blowing up.
[00:53:58.382 --> 00:53:58.822]  That's it.
[00:53:58.862 --> 00:53:59.643]  The last two rock.
[00:54:18.709 --> 00:54:26.335]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:54:27.176 --> 00:54:28.057]  Move, bitch!
[00:54:28.377 --> 00:54:29.198]  Get out the way!
[00:54:31.292 --> 00:54:37.276]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:41.739]  InfoWars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:54:41.759 --> 00:54:45.221]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:54:45.341 --> 00:54:46.562]  I will not let you down.
[00:54:46.622 --> 00:54:49.264]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:54:49.404 --> 00:54:51.105]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:54:51.485 --> 00:54:53.586]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:54:53.646 --> 00:54:59.130]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.072]  Waging war on corruption and winnings.
[00:55:02.252 --> 00:55:03.113]  Alex Jones.
[00:55:03.673 --> 00:55:04.214]  Victory.
[00:55:10.778 --> 00:55:12.979]  The Trump Hulk, powered by InfoWars.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.240]  Powered by America.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.961]  You are all of you beneath me.
[00:55:16.942 --> 00:55:18.723]  I am a god, you dull creature.
[00:55:18.743 --> 00:55:21.025]  And I will not be bullied by...
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.162]  You've got Macron saying he is the God Jupiter.
[00:55:41.202 --> 00:55:43.903]  That's Roman for Zeus in Greek.
[00:55:45.664 --> 00:55:50.306]  And they questioned him about it, and he said, and now your children will all have 11 mandatory vaccines.
[00:55:50.586 --> 00:56:02.432]  And he called the government together at the Palace of Versailles, the Sun God, more delusional garbage, from Louis the whatever he was, and said, I am a God, and you will do what I say.
[00:56:04.522 --> 00:56:12.209]  I mean, they've taken the child sex toy of the elite, they admit that, and put him on a gold throne, and are all worshipping him.
[00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.573]  I mean, France is truly off its rocker, man.
[00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:19.036]  Completely off its rocker.
[00:56:19.416 --> 00:56:22.659]  And they had him do his acceptance speech in front of a giant
[00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.935]  Pyramid with an all-seeing eye.
[00:56:25.075 --> 00:56:27.378]  That's a real photo if you're watching us on TV.
[00:56:27.398 --> 00:56:29.160]  By the way, folks, keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:56:29.701 --> 00:56:30.522]  They're trying to censor.
[00:56:30.542 --> 00:56:31.263]  They're trying to block.
[00:56:31.283 --> 00:56:32.284]  They're trying to block memes.
[00:56:32.304 --> 00:56:33.525]  They're trying to stop InfoWars.
[00:56:33.746 --> 00:56:39.132]  But they can't stop you spreading the link by hand, putting it on business cards, calling it to talk radio, C-SPAN.
[00:56:40.339 --> 00:56:42.701]  With CNN as fake news, Infowars.com.
[00:56:43.381 --> 00:56:44.442]  This is the tip of the spear.
[00:56:44.462 --> 00:56:47.945]  They're trying to crush us as an example to others to intimidate others.
[00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:55.451]  And they want to give simulated mentally ill victories to liberals who kind of buy into the system and live through extension.
[00:56:56.738 --> 00:56:59.460]  Vicariously through the mainstream media.
[00:56:59.741 --> 00:57:01.582]  They believe they're the cultural elites.
[00:57:02.243 --> 00:57:07.027]  They believe that establishment fashion in Hollywood is still avant-garde.
[00:57:07.347 --> 00:57:11.871]  There's nothing more uncool than to be modern avant-garde.
[00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:12.952]  It's not avant-garde.
[00:57:13.352 --> 00:57:18.456]  Nationalism, freedom, the renaissance, strength, men being men, women being women.
[00:57:18.716 --> 00:57:19.777]  You can be whatever you want.
[00:57:19.917 --> 00:57:21.819]  I don't care if you're a tranny.
[00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:22.620]  I literally don't!
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:28.081]  But you want to act like I do and then make me accept teaching my children about it?
[00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:28.781]  Uh-uh!
[00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:30.501]  That's called pervert behavior.
[00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:32.682]  That's called mainline and pedophilia.
[00:57:33.502 --> 00:57:34.182]  We're going to go to break.
[00:57:34.462 --> 00:57:36.402]  We have huge breaking news coming up.
[00:57:36.682 --> 00:57:39.523]  Top scientists are worried about the real Andromeda strain.
[00:57:39.543 --> 00:57:41.063]  I haven't gotten to this yet.
[00:57:41.683 --> 00:57:42.663]  New Chimera news.
[00:57:42.723 --> 00:57:44.464]  I'm really going to focus in on actual documents.
[00:57:44.704 --> 00:57:45.544]  I forgot my other folder.
[00:57:45.564 --> 00:57:47.184]  Can I have my Chimera folder?
[00:57:47.424 --> 00:57:52.125]  We've got more on the Vatican sex scandal that we broke on Monday with total precision.
[00:57:52.785 --> 00:57:56.648]  Total precision and then three days later, two days later, it all broke exactly as we said.
[00:57:57.089 --> 00:57:59.551]  The mass gay orgy and exactly who he told you was involved.
[00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:01.693]  Because Leo Zegami lives by there.
[00:58:01.733 --> 00:58:03.274]  He meets with the Vatican police.
[00:58:03.294 --> 00:58:04.575]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:58:04.735 --> 00:58:09.059]  I have been with him when he met with them and then went off and had a closed door meeting with them.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.901]  So I don't just believe Zegami.
[00:58:10.941 --> 00:58:14.324]  I went there to see it for myself and I'll leave it at that for you.
[00:58:15.044 --> 00:58:16.526]  But that is all coming up briefly.
[00:58:17.628 --> 00:58:19.229]  Free shipping throughout the month of July.
[00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:20.030]  I've extended it.
[00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.231]  A bunch of big sales.
[00:58:21.411 --> 00:58:25.854]  MycoZX, the antifungal probiotic, is back.
[00:58:26.815 --> 00:58:28.696]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:29.037 --> 00:58:31.979]  And we've got 30% discounts on SuperMetal Vitality and more.
[00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:34.821]  DNA Force has been sold out for five months.
[00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:36.942]  DNA Force, our top product.
[00:58:37.062 --> 00:58:39.044]  Amazing with the BioPQQ backend.
[00:58:39.524 --> 00:58:41.846]  And 20% off InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:42.046 --> 00:58:43.387]  Without you, we are nothing.
[00:58:43.767 --> 00:58:45.289]  Thank you for supporting the broadcast.
[00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:46.690]  Hour 2 straight ahead.
[00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:50.792]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.635 --> 00:59:00.519]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[00:59:00.699 --> 00:59:01.940]  The contest is simple.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:06.783]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[00:59:07.484 --> 00:59:14.849]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and has also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[00:59:15.009 --> 00:59:21.573]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:21.673 --> 00:59:31.560]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:39.305]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:59:39.485 --> 00:59:49.434]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[00:59:49.574 --> 00:59:52.917]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[00:59:53.037 --> 00:59:53.898]  This is Kit Daniels.
[00:59:55.719 --> 00:59:59.803]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:00.324 --> 01:00:01.605]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:17.816]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:18.316 --> 01:00:20.757]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:21.277 --> 01:00:23.577]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:32.920]  Well, growth is slowing as the globalists try to drive down the stock market and kill investment.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.401]  But still, Trump's trying to pull us out of the storm.
[01:00:35.921 --> 01:00:38.002]  And your exuberance is helping do that as well.
[01:00:39.127 --> 01:00:40.347]  Boom times for recruiters.
[01:00:40.487 --> 01:00:41.168]  iPhone maker.
[01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:43.368]  Foxconn considering bringing jobs to Wisconsin.
[01:00:43.868 --> 01:00:46.729]  Silicon Valley, new vision for pizzeria.
[01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:47.269]  Robots!
[01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:50.750]  That's right, less jobs for folks, so let's get rid of more jobs.
[01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:55.091]  And the globalists know that humans build their own environment.
[01:00:56.351 --> 01:00:57.172]  But look at drudge!
[01:00:57.592 --> 01:01:00.032]  Drug-fueled gay orgy at Vatican.
[01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:01.333]  Church rocked.
[01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:02.433]  Pope fury.
[01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:06.034]  His answer is to remove all the conservative leaders who are criticizing it.
[01:01:07.554 --> 01:01:08.775]  Now, where did you hear about this?
[01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:13.658]  Because this broke mainstream news on Wednesday night, or Wednesday.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.262]  And then now, we've got this.
[01:01:19.362 --> 01:01:22.845]  Now, where did we all originally hear about that?
[01:01:22.865 --> 01:01:30.991]  That's right, let's play this clip from Leo Zagami on the broadcast Monday from Rome, who broke it on his website.
[01:01:32.372 --> 01:01:33.273]  Over the weekend, here it is.
[01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:08.944]  And they were using cocaine, and they basically had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal, who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:20.693]  So there is also an internal war here, and of course, nobody wanted to show the face of this priest, but I wanted to show it to your viewers.
[01:02:20.713 --> 01:02:23.436]  He's called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi.
[01:02:24.296 --> 01:02:30.677]  And only very few media, I think only RT probably just mentioned the name of Capozzi's boss.
[01:02:30.697 --> 01:02:33.098]  So there you go.
[01:02:33.138 --> 01:02:39.479]  He had reported it days before and then RT had just barely mentioned there was some SWAT raid, but now he's at the full deal.
[01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:41.099]  Now let's expand on that.
[01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:50.081]  You've got the Deputy Pope being busted days before, reportedly recruiting and then raping and grabbing and procuring hundreds of children.
[01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.995]  What does Hillary Clinton stay up late at night?
[01:02:54.055 --> 01:02:56.476]  What does John Podesta stay up late at night worried about?
[01:02:56.577 --> 01:02:58.758]  They worry about us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:03.641]  And that's why I'm so proud of the work we've all been doing together.
[01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:05.323]  But that's why we're targeted.
[01:03:05.703 --> 01:03:06.744]  That's why we're under attack.
[01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:16.250]  That's why they make things up about us that we never said or did, or that they edit together to twist, is because they want to inoculate the public not to believe us when we tell them things that are true.
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:19.833]  Because without Drudge Report, without InfoWars, without a few other outlets,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.042]  None of this information would ever come out.
[01:03:24.122 --> 01:03:28.646]  We're able, because of our audience, to punch through.
[01:03:28.706 --> 01:03:31.688]  Let's put that Ben Garrison graphic back up from during the campaign.
[01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:34.110]  What keeps Hillary up at night?
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:35.571]  What keeps the globalist up at night?
[01:03:36.432 --> 01:03:37.933]  The Make America Great Again movement.
[01:03:38.053 --> 01:03:39.414]  Alex Jones, the Infowars.
[01:03:40.395 --> 01:03:44.358]  Folks like the UKIP movement and Nigel Farage.
[01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:45.659]  That's the reality.
[01:03:45.699 --> 01:03:48.882]  But more important than ever, it's the Make America Great movement.
[01:03:50.811 --> 01:03:51.632]  You're imagining things.
[01:03:51.652 --> 01:03:52.813]  Hillary, go back to sleep.
[01:03:53.113 --> 01:03:55.096]  Uma, the racist boogeyman, are here.
[01:03:57.258 --> 01:04:03.244]  They got the little pickle jar there and all her pills, where she couldn't open the pickle jar, and then it turned out she didn't open the pickle jar.
[01:04:03.284 --> 01:04:08.670]  She'd already had it open for her, and then Jimmy Kimmel would admit, Alex Jones is right.
[01:04:10.552 --> 01:04:11.433]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:04:13.882 --> 01:04:14.843]  Hillary Clinton is sick.
[01:04:14.863 --> 01:04:15.984]  Hillary Clinton fell down.
[01:04:16.304 --> 01:04:21.950]  Hillary Clinton, a month after we told you the Secret Service told us she's having seizures every 45 minutes, has a special black ambulance.
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.711]  You saw it all!
[01:04:24.312 --> 01:04:25.814]  We told you Trump was going to win.
[01:04:25.854 --> 01:04:27.095]  We told you the polls were fake.
[01:04:27.335 --> 01:04:28.836]  We told you she tried to steal the states.
[01:04:29.057 --> 01:04:31.419]  We told you they were giving the questions about the debates beforehand.
[01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:35.042]  We told you your toaster and your new microwave oven's got microphones in it.
[01:04:35.703 --> 01:04:37.344]  He told us the dishwasher's watching you.
[01:04:37.704 --> 01:04:38.564]  All of it true.
[01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:39.985]  All of it's come out.
[01:04:40.185 --> 01:04:40.905]  So what do they do?
[01:04:40.945 --> 01:04:42.426]  They go, he's fake news!
[01:04:42.526 --> 01:04:46.528]  But instead, the wreath of fake news is hung around their neck.
[01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:50.990]  And then they send in their little henchwoman, their little witchy-poo.
[01:04:52.331 --> 01:04:53.811]  They send her on a fool's errand.
[01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:55.172]  They send Megyn Kelly here.
[01:04:55.832 --> 01:04:59.414]  Just like Piers Morgan, they come to the Info War to politically die.
[01:04:59.434 --> 01:05:01.275]  And now she's sinking like a stone.
[01:05:05.206 --> 01:05:07.397]  I don't know.
[01:05:21.502 --> 01:05:25.148]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[01:05:25.248 --> 01:05:26.650]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.212]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[01:05:28.412 --> 01:05:30.656]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:31.898]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:05:31.958 --> 01:05:32.679]  Big waiting list.
[01:05:32.839 --> 01:05:36.465]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:05:36.585 --> 01:05:37.466]  Nobody's got something this good.
[01:05:37.706 --> 01:05:44.550]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 million live in each pill.
[01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:52.214]  Probiotic MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and wild-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:05:52.294 --> 01:05:57.997]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx and ForageLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:05:58.757 --> 01:06:00.458]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:06.162]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:06.782]  Now it's epidemic.
[01:06:06.802 --> 01:06:09.664]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on air and tell you what it did for them.
[01:06:09.684 --> 01:06:11.966]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:06:12.046 --> 01:06:15.068]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:06:19.383 --> 01:06:22.027]  We've taken Brain Force and made it Brain Force Plus.
[01:06:22.247 --> 01:06:25.992]  Now at 20% more in the bottle and an even more hardcore formula.
[01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.475]  You owe it to yourself to get these products.
[01:06:28.535 --> 01:06:30.999]  They really have worked for myself, my family.
[01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:33.142]  They have five-star reviews by the thousands.
[01:06:33.242 --> 01:06:34.183]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:37.253 --> 01:06:44.696]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of barium.
[01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:47.037]  It's nanotube technology.
[01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.178]  It's created here in Texas.
[01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:56.901]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:06:57.221 --> 01:07:00.182]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:07:00.262 --> 01:07:00.963]  It's amazing!
[01:07:04.423 --> 01:07:10.605]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.866]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:07:14.206 --> 01:07:19.388]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:25.789]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:29.050]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.671]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:35.015]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:07:35.195 --> 01:07:38.057]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.719]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:07:39.819 --> 01:07:42.982]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:07:43.282 --> 01:07:45.604]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:07:45.884 --> 01:07:46.845]  It's in powder form.
[01:07:46.945 --> 01:07:49.647]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:07:49.828 --> 01:07:50.428]  I take this.
[01:07:50.548 --> 01:07:52.230]  This is the product that I take.
[01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.312]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:07:55.132 --> 01:07:55.912]  We fight the Globals.
[01:07:55.932 --> 01:07:56.773]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:11.839]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[01:08:16.511 --> 01:08:20.415]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:26.922]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:08:26.942 --> 01:08:31.786]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:36.091]  What is the secret of Soylent?
[01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:38.974]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:08:39.454 --> 01:08:41.617]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:08:42.097 --> 01:08:46.202]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.666]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:53.029]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.152]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:08:57.793 --> 01:09:09.664]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:12.246]  So enjoy the flavors!
[01:09:12.286 --> 01:09:16.751]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:09:16.931 --> 01:09:18.452]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:09:18.912 --> 01:09:20.414]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:22.015]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:09:22.095 --> 01:09:23.697]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:09:23.977 --> 01:09:35.309]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:39.473]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:09:39.713 --> 01:09:46.020]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:09:54.204 --> 01:09:56.405]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:09:56.825 --> 01:10:01.246]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:10:01.706 --> 01:10:03.487]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:10:04.227 --> 01:10:13.009]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:10:13.589 --> 01:10:16.070]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.151]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:20.352]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:10:20.372 --> 01:10:23.954]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:10:24.694 --> 01:10:27.455]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[01:10:27.916 --> 01:10:30.937]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:10:31.197 --> 01:10:33.438]  We've got to stop them!
[01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:37.620]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.922]  Soylent Green is people!
[01:10:50.155 --> 01:10:51.535]  You know, I hate Hollywood.
[01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.356]  I'm almost embarrassed.
[01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:54.696]  I've been in a few big Hollywood films.
[01:10:55.156 --> 01:10:56.176]  It's just so inathema.
[01:10:56.596 --> 01:11:11.600]  I just, I still get giddy over the fact that I interviewed Charlton Heston a few times and had some lengthy phone conversations with him because he was so real and so cool and spent, I mean the word it was like 50 million dollars, most of his money
[01:11:12.617 --> 01:11:18.140]  Funding the NRA, his own private jet, flying around the country, meeting and talking with school kids.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:24.824]  Other talk show host I know said that he would encourage them and have phone conversations with them and pray with them on the phone and stuff.
[01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.084]  I had a few conversations with him.
[01:11:26.725 --> 01:11:30.126]  I mean, just such a cool guy, the opposite of an egomaniac.
[01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:33.408]  He was in the civil rights movement in the 50s.
[01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:37.850]  And got attacked and roughed up and stuff.
[01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:42.932]  I mean, we're talking about marching in Oklahoma and marching in Alabama when you got killed doing it.
[01:11:42.952 --> 01:11:45.953]  He wasn't somebody that came around later in the late 60s and acted like he was part of it.
[01:11:46.193 --> 01:11:47.874]  Just such a cool guy, Charlton Heston.
[01:11:48.114 --> 01:11:50.075]  A true civil rights activist for all of our rights.
[01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:58.918]  Every time I see Charlton Heston or think about it, he's just so cool compared to these purely selfish, selfish, worldly people.
[01:12:00.278 --> 01:12:04.119]  No, I totally agree.
[01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:09.300]  I mean, I think Lindsay Lohan or something just came out.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.561]  I saw something on Drudge to where she was supporting President Trump.
[01:12:12.921 --> 01:12:17.582]  What gets me is the fact that there's just so much negativity going on right now.
[01:12:17.622 --> 01:12:19.262]  I mean, you have so many different things.
[01:12:19.943 --> 01:12:25.144]  I mean, I have a lot of respect for President Trump because he's got so many things on his plate right now.
[01:12:26.144 --> 01:12:30.785]  So much opposition coming at him as well from every different direction.
[01:12:31.386 --> 01:12:33.566]  And I just feel like I owe him a debt for being so real.
[01:12:33.586 --> 01:12:43.889]  Just like Heston or Barry Goldwater or Ron Paul, I see these elder statesmen and people that have done so much, and as a man, I just feel such fealty and support for them.
[01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:44.630]  Kinship.
[01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.610]  It's very spiritual.
[01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:51.892]  I don't think people, the globalists spend all their time, Dr. Group, never wanting men to get to that level in their lives.
[01:12:51.912 --> 01:12:52.312]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:55.393]  Well, the reason why is because they're trying to sterilize all the men.
[01:12:55.453 --> 01:12:58.735]  I mean, there's a big, huge, it's been going on for years and years and years.
[01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:12.402]  I mean, the population control and all the stuff that we've been exposing about the chemicals in the food and the glyphosate and the engineering that's going on and the chimeras and all of the things that we're dealing with right now as far as controlling the population.
[01:13:12.502 --> 01:13:19.705]  One of the shocking things that really has gotten me is how the far left and how the Democrats have handled this election.
[01:13:19.745 --> 01:13:21.306]  I mean, the robotic
[01:13:22.415 --> 01:13:27.456]  The culture, the violence, the attacks, all of this stuff.
[01:13:27.596 --> 01:13:29.456]  And, you know, we're talking about health care.
[01:13:29.476 --> 01:13:34.257]  It's publicly, you said this 20 years ago, but it's publicly aimed at our consciousness.
[01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.538]  And I don't mean that as metaphysical, our real brainwaves.
[01:13:36.818 --> 01:13:37.578]  Look at the WikiLeaks.
[01:13:37.738 --> 01:13:39.098]  It says we must keep them in the dark.
[01:13:39.398 --> 01:13:40.419]  We must keep them desperate.
[01:13:40.699 --> 01:13:41.819]  We must keep them grasping.
[01:13:41.859 --> 01:13:43.059]  We can't let them have hope.
[01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.480]  I mean, these, the Democrats and Soros are pure evil.
[01:13:47.864 --> 01:14:00.490]  Talking about healthcare, the new healthcare reform, I'm wondering, I mean, every single person that I know that is far left, and I try to talk to them and say, listen, you don't have to believe me.
[01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:03.871]  Why don't you just go do your own research about genetically modified foods?
[01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:08.153]  Now we have GMOs 2.0s with the CRISPR technology and the genetic engineering.
[01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:16.376]  It's the new way that Monsanto and Syngenta and Dow AgriSciences and everybody else can get away from having to label their stuff.
[01:14:16.456 --> 01:14:18.416]  It is light years, it is light years worse.
[01:14:18.436 --> 01:14:20.297]  And you're going to be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:14:20.317 --> 01:14:21.217]  We have another guest joining us.
[01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.658]  We're going to get into a lot, Dr. Group.
[01:14:22.898 --> 01:14:27.340]  But you were also just a special operations staff, special task forces with the military in Korea.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.420]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.122]  Escalating situation with the top military commander for the US says we're prepared for war with North Korea.
[01:14:35.522 --> 01:14:37.603]  So does the commander of the Korean forces.
[01:14:38.023 --> 01:14:40.203]  So we've got the biggest preparations ever for war.
[01:14:40.764 --> 01:14:42.724]  You were telling me off-air, is it a trap for Trump?
[01:14:42.864 --> 01:14:43.924]  We'll discuss that.
[01:14:44.505 --> 01:14:45.605]  But before we go any further...
[01:14:47.369 --> 01:14:51.712]  What do you make of Trump and millions on the streets of Warsaw to see Trump?
[01:14:52.112 --> 01:14:53.653]  Trump saying, we will defend the West.
[01:14:53.753 --> 01:14:55.374]  Newsweek saying, that's racist.
[01:14:56.035 --> 01:14:58.476]  Atlantic Monthly saying, no, the West will fall.
[01:14:58.596 --> 01:15:00.258]  Muslims will take over.
[01:15:00.638 --> 01:15:01.278]  Christianity.
[01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:02.439]  I mean, these are quotes.
[01:15:02.779 --> 01:15:06.201]  How could these globalists be any more racist, any more traitor?
[01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:12.806]  And then there are white people doing it, trying to get everybody fighting with each other to divide and conquer against free market.
[01:15:12.826 --> 01:15:13.666]  They're trying to sell
[01:15:14.827 --> 01:15:25.934]  The minorities, the majority, times seven globally, are not wanting free market, trying to trump free market and prosperity with some weird racism brainwashing.
[01:15:26.415 --> 01:15:31.478]  Well, because the shadow governments for years have controlled the world.
[01:15:31.898 --> 01:15:40.244]  And when you look at all these other countries, that's why you're starting to see the people, because it's we the people that make a difference in the world, they're starting to stand up and they're starting to say,
[01:15:41.144 --> 01:15:50.412]  If they can do it in the United States, if they can turn around and get these globalists out of the office, it didn't matter if they were Republican or Democrat.
[01:15:50.432 --> 01:15:56.077]  I mean, if you just study how it all works and who really runs the whole system, those are just puppets.
[01:15:56.157 --> 01:16:00.201]  But for once, the first time, just Independence Day here.
[01:16:00.281 --> 01:16:04.785]  I mean, all the people, I've never experienced so much joy.
[01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:07.927]  On the 4th of July in the last 20 years.
[01:16:08.168 --> 01:16:10.670]  I've never seen as many flags flying in yards.
[01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:14.754]  I've never seen so many people coming together as one.
[01:16:14.774 --> 01:16:15.454]  Have you?
[01:16:15.474 --> 01:16:19.378]  No, I mean I was watching Fox News earlier and I guess we didn't have the DVR on.
[01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:22.240]  It showed from the top of a building and it was like 10 streets.
[01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:24.963]  They're starting to see that people can make a difference.
[01:16:25.003 --> 01:16:26.844]  I mean, that people came together.
[01:16:48.702 --> 01:16:50.963]  No one in the world thought that Trump was going to win.
[01:16:51.183 --> 01:16:53.083]  All of a sudden, Trump wins.
[01:16:53.503 --> 01:16:55.144]  It gives hope to the world.
[01:16:55.164 --> 01:16:56.024]  No, I said he was going to win.
[01:16:56.644 --> 01:16:58.965]  Well, we said he was going to win.
[01:16:59.005 --> 01:16:59.845]  That's why they were panicking.
[01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:03.446]  We had the internal Google numbers that was even coming out in trade publications.
[01:17:03.466 --> 01:17:06.107]  The Bloomberg interfaces that are tied into everything.
[01:17:06.127 --> 01:17:07.688]  It's like its own private NSA, as you know.
[01:17:07.928 --> 01:17:08.948]  That's how he's made hundreds of billions.
[01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.181]  They all knew Trump was like 15, 20 points ahead.
[01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:15.944]  That's why they kept oversampling to try to create the illusion that he was going to lose.
[01:17:16.244 --> 01:17:22.069]  Then they tried to steal the election, but the state authorities were there blocking Obama and Homeland Security from breaking in.
[01:17:22.089 --> 01:17:22.569]  They caught him!
[01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:25.152]  And they blocked the hacks in six states.
[01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:26.172]  We failed in five.
[01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:27.413]  Trump almost lost.
[01:17:27.834 --> 01:17:37.622]  But I mean, because again, imagine if he would have had the real victory, a 15, 20 point win in the popular vote instead of Hillary stealing so much that it looked like she won by two million.
[01:17:37.882 --> 01:17:43.105]  Oh, I know, and now California's refusing to release their voter data because Trump's put together that.
[01:17:43.446 --> 01:17:46.327]  And Harvard confirms 5.7 million did vote illegally.
[01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:47.848]  Not 3.3, 5.7.
[01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:59.916]  No, so I mean, to get back to your point, I mean, I think with Poland... Poland has been run over by the Russians, run over by the Nazis, but run over hundreds of times by the Muslims!
[01:18:01.192 --> 01:18:02.733]  And, uh, you know, that's the fact!
[01:18:03.173 --> 01:18:11.217]  Think about all the good... Imagine if you lived in a country where you had been overrun hundreds of times every generation by Muslims mass-murdering you.
[01:18:11.457 --> 01:18:12.538]  Would you then let them in?
[01:18:15.099 --> 01:18:30.957]  No, I wouldn't, but when you have people like Soros and you have people that are funding these revolutions for the negative side and trying to create socialism in different countries and even in America where we're only, you know, we were so close to having our guns taken away and they're still creating that
[01:18:31.678 --> 01:18:32.759]  We're good to go.
[01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:56.091]  Now, Pocahontas has come out and said, yes, we want to wreck it.
[01:18:56.171 --> 01:18:56.832]  That's the plan.
[01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:00.114]  We always told you that because they said that was the plan.
[01:19:00.334 --> 01:19:00.955]  Let me ask you this.
[01:19:00.975 --> 01:19:01.595]  We're going to break.
[01:19:02.055 --> 01:19:17.486]  I played the Soylent Green intro because we're going to get into some of these runaway technologies that even mainline scientists say are already destabilizing the Earth, the true environmental threats to our own lives, the planet, the real Andromeda strain, all of it coming up in the next segment.
[01:19:17.626 --> 01:19:19.327]  But you've got a bunch of other topics you want to get into.
[01:19:20.034 --> 01:19:22.575]  Well, I mean, we could talk about all different kinds of things.
[01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:27.216]  What we're seeing right now, again, is just a world that's stressed out, but it's starting to be good.
[01:19:27.276 --> 01:19:33.797]  I mean, we're starting to see people that actually have hope again, that have joy in their lives again, people that are going online.
[01:19:33.817 --> 01:19:35.318]  You get all these memes.
[01:19:35.358 --> 01:19:37.178]  I mean, everything is backfiring.
[01:19:37.678 --> 01:19:39.879]  The positive is starting to take over.
[01:19:39.899 --> 01:19:41.259]  The pendulum is swinging hard.
[01:19:41.279 --> 01:19:47.321]  The negative is starting to go down, and you're starting to see that, and you're starting to see all of the people that are coming together.
[01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:50.762]  The joy of... And the elites are panicking.
[01:19:51.082 --> 01:19:54.383]  Some are admitting they're losing, but others are going, I'm God, like Macron.
[01:19:54.683 --> 01:19:56.083]  He declared himself God-Emperor.
[01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:58.724]  Yeah, look what happened to CNN with just that one meme.
[01:19:58.784 --> 01:20:00.825]  I mean, now you have thousands of memes coming out.
[01:20:01.425 --> 01:20:01.965]  Absolutely.
[01:20:01.985 --> 01:20:13.128]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history,
[01:20:19.554 --> 01:20:26.178]  Historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[01:20:27.498 --> 01:20:43.027]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[01:20:43.993 --> 01:20:57.560]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:05.584]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[01:21:06.479 --> 01:21:09.360]  That our species has never even imagined.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:17.283]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[01:21:19.363 --> 01:21:27.586]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[01:21:28.406 --> 01:21:32.668]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:35.749]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[01:21:36.789 --> 01:21:50.932]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, the people of the world.
[01:21:51.472 --> 01:22:01.394]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[01:22:02.394 --> 01:22:05.215]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[01:22:07.014 --> 01:22:09.175]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:14.438]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[01:22:14.798 --> 01:22:15.699]  It's why they hate me.
[01:22:15.979 --> 01:22:16.860]  It's why they hate you.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.901]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[01:22:20.121 --> 01:22:26.005]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[01:22:26.545 --> 01:22:31.748]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead.
[01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:36.861]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[01:22:36.881 --> 01:22:40.242]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[01:22:40.662 --> 01:22:46.744]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[01:22:47.244 --> 01:22:54.327]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[01:22:55.219 --> 01:22:56.999]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[01:22:57.059 --> 01:23:03.260]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbridge Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.581]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:15.822]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[01:23:16.123 --> 01:23:19.543]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:21.563]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:28.653]  Long lasting sale in the history of Infowars.
[01:23:29.314 --> 01:23:37.619]  Because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.022]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together.
[01:23:41.963 --> 01:23:44.224]  Because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[01:23:44.744 --> 01:23:51.389]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:53.691]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[01:24:09.574 --> 01:24:11.416]  The real Andromeda strain.
[01:24:13.718 --> 01:24:20.244]  Alien life forms already on Earth.
[01:24:20.404 --> 01:24:24.308]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:24:25.889 --> 01:24:30.614]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:40.806 --> 01:24:42.427]  A special laboratory in Nevada.
[01:24:42.907 --> 01:24:43.588]  We brought you here.
[01:24:44.468 --> 01:24:45.049]  You're sick.
[01:24:46.029 --> 01:24:53.274]  In a true biological crisis which our exploration of space could bring about, the present lunar receiving laboratory might prove inadequate.
[01:24:53.754 --> 01:24:58.757]  I therefore urge the establishment of a facility to deal specifically with an extraterrestrial form of life.
[01:24:59.157 --> 01:25:01.519]  Seems to me, General, Dr. Stone put one over on you.
[01:25:01.619 --> 01:25:06.002]  In fact, he made us all think his wildfire lab could handle any contamination from outer space.
[01:25:06.662 --> 01:25:07.803]  Isolate and identify it.
[01:25:11.738 --> 01:25:12.398]  It's no accident.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.384]  I suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon.
[01:25:17.424 --> 01:25:18.305]  You can change everything.
[01:25:18.325 --> 01:25:24.031]  From the novel by Michael Crichton.
[01:25:24.492 --> 01:25:26.013]  It's crazy, I didn't know buzzards fly at night.
[01:25:26.694 --> 01:25:28.016]  Buzzards only come when something's dead.
[01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:30.671]  Send all deckers to Cable 1.
[01:25:30.711 --> 01:25:31.392]  What's happening?
[01:25:31.572 --> 01:25:32.152]  We see bodies.
[01:25:32.552 --> 01:25:33.673]  Lots of them.
[01:25:33.713 --> 01:25:35.433]  These people were cut down in mid-stride.
[01:25:35.894 --> 01:25:37.214]  Everybody's dead!
[01:25:37.574 --> 01:25:37.875]  You!
[01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:40.376]  You did it!
[01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.077]  I recommend calling a wildfire alert.
[01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:45.138]  All members of your team have been cleared and are now being crawled in.
[01:25:45.858 --> 01:25:49.040]  If things get out of control, even you can't work miracles.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.961]  Grandpa, there was a car and he got guns!
[01:25:52.521 --> 01:25:53.282]  What's going on?
[01:25:53.442 --> 01:25:55.123]  Discommunication is being monitored.
[01:26:02.043 --> 01:26:03.684]  I never believed this could really happen.
[01:26:03.724 --> 01:26:04.344]  You used to.
[01:26:04.384 --> 01:26:05.244]  You knew it!
[01:26:05.324 --> 01:26:07.725]  I didn't think it possible.
[01:26:07.785 --> 01:26:09.866]  I wish I could believe you.
[01:26:09.886 --> 01:26:19.249]  What you do or not, the only important thing you know is to find the antidote.
[01:26:19.329 --> 01:26:21.330]  Even with a microscope, you're blind.
[01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:22.971]  I'm turning off the oxygen.
[01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.031]  Experiment with your own life, dammit!
[01:26:25.151 --> 01:26:25.512]  I'm scared.
[01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:46.658]  Now the reason I wanted to play that, we're going to get into this a lot more in the next longer segment with Dr. Group, is there are thousands and thousands of new animal human clones, chimeras, not just embryonic.
[01:26:47.338 --> 01:26:51.599]  They're then putting those genetics into corn that grows pharmacological stem cells.
[01:26:51.899 --> 01:26:53.679]  This is the stuff that's admitted for decades.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:59.901]  They have created tens of thousands of animal, animal, animal insect, animal plant
[01:27:00.902 --> 01:27:25.432]  Chimeras from Greek mythology, but it's real now and for 27 years I've been talking about it the media would always say it didn't exist, but it was in Medical and scientific literature now top scientists are in pop science eco watch Smithsonian evaluation of phenotype stability and ecological risk of a genetically engineered algae in open pond production They're putting stuff
[01:27:26.252 --> 01:27:27.312]  That's totally alien.
[01:27:27.752 --> 01:27:28.613]  It's not real algae.
[01:27:28.653 --> 01:27:29.673]  It's not real bacteria.
[01:27:29.713 --> 01:27:30.553]  It's not real mold.
[01:27:30.773 --> 01:27:31.513]  It's not real yeast.
[01:27:32.654 --> 01:27:33.414]  It's not real algae.
[01:27:33.454 --> 01:27:34.434]  It's a mix of all these.
[01:27:34.754 --> 01:27:35.915]  You basically can't kill it.
[01:27:35.955 --> 01:27:37.995]  It grows a hundred times faster or more.
[01:27:38.015 --> 01:27:41.276]  And I'm not saying this will be the Andromeda strain.
[01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:49.998]  I'm saying with tens of thousands of experiments going on every month now, this acceleration, something much bigger than the Manhattan Project, how long until it triggers something disastrous?
[01:27:50.279 --> 01:27:54.160]  We've already seen disasters, but this makes nuclear plants melting down look tame.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.280]  Dr. Groob,
[01:27:55.681 --> 01:27:58.757]  Are we approaching the Atlantean moment and why are the elite doing this?
[01:27:59.597 --> 01:28:13.162]  It's been going on for a long time when DARPA started messing around with transgenics, taking animal DNA or genes and merging them with humans and cross species, basically, whatever you want to say.
[01:28:13.182 --> 01:28:17.424]  It morphed into genetically modified organisms for our food.
[01:28:17.604 --> 01:28:26.428]  DARPA was doing the research with the spider goats back in the day to create, you know, high tensile strength ropes and all kinds of, you know, gear for the military.
[01:28:27.328 --> 01:28:39.238]  One thing that people don't realize is how deep this goes and the unfortunate thing is they're using taxpayer dollars to fund all of this transgenic research and there is a fight.
[01:28:39.338 --> 01:28:42.922]  It's like the nuclear fight that went on years ago between the USA and Russia.
[01:28:43.422 --> 01:28:46.344]  This is going on under the table and there's a fight in a race
[01:28:48.206 --> 01:28:59.554]  From China, India, United States and Russia to be able to create these organisms, whether it's a transgenic fish, whether it's a food, all of these different technologies.
[01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:02.716]  Cross carbon versus silicone?
[01:29:03.156 --> 01:29:11.983]  So it used to be genetically modified organism and what we have now is we have GMO 2.0 and this is not in the mainstream
[01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:15.827]  They admit they're now splicing silicon with biological.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.462]  Labeled by the USDA or the FDA.
[01:29:30.502 --> 01:29:31.263]  So let's explain.
[01:29:31.743 --> 01:29:34.665]  The general public's told by mainstream pop culture this doesn't exist.
[01:29:35.025 --> 01:29:36.947]  But in all main literature, it's everywhere.
[01:29:37.347 --> 01:29:37.507]  Yes.
[01:29:37.587 --> 01:29:41.049]  Just the stuff they admit is beyond any science fiction movie you ever heard.
[01:29:41.069 --> 01:29:45.252]  I mean, this is like we're in the year 20, you know, 900 or something.
[01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:47.574]  I mean, we're already in the future, folks.
[01:29:47.834 --> 01:29:48.374]  We'll be back.
[01:29:48.435 --> 01:29:48.875]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.577 --> 01:29:55.566]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.508 --> 01:29:59.196]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.511 --> 01:30:08.032]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:08.492 --> 01:30:14.533]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.934 --> 01:30:17.734]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:18.134 --> 01:30:21.135]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:21.335 --> 01:30:24.776]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:25.096 --> 01:30:26.856]  The left controls culture.
[01:30:26.896 --> 01:30:27.877]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.937 --> 01:30:29.157]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:36.461]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:36.521 --> 01:30:38.923]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:39.403 --> 01:30:43.265]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:43.325 --> 01:30:45.387]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate.
[01:30:46.027 --> 01:30:51.409]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:57.892]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.972 --> 01:30:59.673]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.813 --> 01:31:01.014]  It's available right now.
[01:31:01.334 --> 01:31:03.875]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:04.315 --> 01:31:06.616]  Hi, I'm the Democratic National Committee.
[01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:10.178]  I got hacked by the Russians and all my emails got out to the public.
[01:31:11.084 --> 01:31:15.938]  I had undercover journalists expose that I staged protests and will use violence and cheating to win.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.382]  I had to fire the head of my committee because she was incompetent.
[01:31:20.462 --> 01:31:23.984]  My presidential candidate had an illegal private server with classified documents.
[01:31:24.084 --> 01:31:28.706]  But when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials, we would not give it to them.
[01:31:29.447 --> 01:31:34.109]  That same presidential candidate was married to an impeached former president who is also a rapist.
[01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:42.214]  My last president is also involved, as he has absconded and is hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public.
[01:31:42.694 --> 01:31:49.361]  I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year.
[01:31:49.481 --> 01:31:53.265]  I had multiple members of my party arrested for pedophilic activity this year.
[01:31:54.766 --> 01:31:56.268]  Have I mentioned Trump-Russia yet?
[01:31:57.469 --> 01:32:01.213]  For InfoWars.com, that's the DNC, this is Owen Troyer.
[01:32:04.307 --> 01:32:05.728]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:32:05.888 --> 01:32:08.310]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[01:32:08.491 --> 01:32:15.776]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:32:15.977 --> 01:32:26.305]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:34.168]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:32:34.468 --> 01:32:44.412]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:32:44.672 --> 01:32:46.573]  And this part is most important.
[01:32:46.713 --> 01:32:53.156]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:32:53.516 --> 01:32:54.597]  That means it's clean.
[01:32:54.977 --> 01:32:55.938]  That means it's pure.
[01:32:56.098 --> 01:32:58.900]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.622]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:33:01.782 --> 01:33:03.423]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:33:19.364 --> 01:33:21.010]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.492 --> 01:33:23.017]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:23.479 --> 01:33:24.382]  Or you're mine.
[01:33:49.707 --> 01:34:02.194]  Remember in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, folks, where he's running through the Egyptian town, or I guess it's the Tunisian town, looking for the Lost Ark, and a big swordsman comes out and swings the sword around.
[01:34:02.214 --> 01:34:03.655]  If you're a radio listener, I'll describe it for you.
[01:34:03.955 --> 01:34:08.057]  But we put Trump's face on Harrison Ford's there.
[01:34:08.097 --> 01:34:09.458]  We'll see how CNN likes that.
[01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:14.160]  Now, I want to make a statement here and then try to let the group roll for a few minutes.
[01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:16.862]  I have four children.
[01:34:18.423 --> 01:34:18.963]  I love them.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:24.903]  And I talk about things on air that I believe will make the world a better place.
[01:34:26.324 --> 01:34:28.465]  I don't do it from some heroic perspective.
[01:34:29.045 --> 01:34:33.948]  I do it from a perspective of wanting to live in a free society and not wanting to die of cancer.
[01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:46.495]  Dr. Groob's gonna break down how they're having this genetic engineering revolution and this nanotech revolution without having big debates about it.
[01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:58.172]  And if we have a breakaway civilization, so much of it is because the public has been indoctrinated into sitcoms and drama and sports, and people are experts on that.
[01:34:59.573 --> 01:35:04.114]  They are not experts on the real world outside of Fantasyland.
[01:35:04.754 --> 01:35:09.715]  They kind of go to work, go to church, maybe go to the gym, maybe go for a hike, go home, watch TV.
[01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:24.882]  While you're on a planet, fantastical, in deep space, orbiting a sun, there's meteor showers, there's birds outside your window, you know, you have your children, you have your neighbors, you have your family, you have this, you know, the mysteries of consciousness.
[01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:28.283]  And the globalists want to discover all that.
[01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:35.485]  So they've taken, since the days of Eisenhower, about 90% of the research money and put it into giant secret programs.
[01:35:36.516 --> 01:35:47.666]  And so all the technology we're given is trojan-horsed and controlled to plug us into this larger AI synthetic system that is a group consciousness brain that can predict the future and control populations.
[01:35:47.846 --> 01:35:48.887]  That's Google's own admissions.
[01:35:49.807 --> 01:35:51.269]  But that's the silicon system!
[01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:56.653]  You got the carbon-based, and they are... I mean, I learned about this 15 years ago.
[01:35:56.693 --> 01:35:57.754]  It's in the news two years ago.
[01:35:58.135 --> 01:36:00.477]  They're putting brain chips in PTSD soldiers now.
[01:36:01.137 --> 01:36:03.940]  They're doing all sorts of secret experimentation, but they're rolling more of it out.
[01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:08.934]  And so, again, the animals have rights.
[01:36:10.195 --> 01:36:16.701]  The animal rights movements are out there, most of them globalist-controlled, eugenics-based systems, openly founded by Peter Singer and others.
[01:36:16.721 --> 01:36:18.622]  That's the godfather of PETA.
[01:36:19.103 --> 01:36:20.804]  And then you've got the human rights movements.
[01:36:21.905 --> 01:36:29.932]  But what about all the research labs and the proliferation and something 50 times bigger than the Manhattan Project going on all around the world?
[01:36:31.095 --> 01:36:32.276]  Not even in remote areas.
[01:36:33.077 --> 01:36:52.697]  Very, very recklessly with gene guns and the CRISPR systems and all these randomly splicing genes, randomly editing them in real time, and then mutagenically injecting them into apes, into human test subjects that sign on for it, into gerbils, into rats.
[01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:59.151]  So GMO 2.0, genetically modified foods with added health benefits is how the Guardian sells it.
[01:36:59.191 --> 01:37:07.595]  We already know the old GMOs, massive cancer increases, stacking genetics, having them grow their own pesticides that eat your liver, all of this.
[01:37:07.635 --> 01:37:11.656]  I mean, remember Congress couldn't even regulate the internet because they didn't even know how it worked 10 years ago.
[01:37:12.017 --> 01:37:14.818]  The head senator from Alaska said it was a bunch of tubes.
[01:37:15.618 --> 01:37:19.502]  So you've got all these old people like Pelosi and folks that don't understand it.
[01:37:19.822 --> 01:37:22.545]  I just read the literature on the science.
[01:37:22.645 --> 01:37:23.486]  It's hard to even understand.
[01:37:24.166 --> 01:37:28.070]  The scientists say most new stuff's being designed by computers when computers aren't even humans.
[01:37:28.570 --> 01:37:31.353]  So this is so theoretical now, but it's actually happening.
[01:37:32.214 --> 01:37:37.359]  And so, there's this giant no-man's land that is the number one threat to humanity.
[01:37:39.425 --> 01:37:43.268]  The globalists admit this, but they're in this power race for life extension.
[01:37:43.668 --> 01:37:48.472]  They're in this power race with other countries, so whoever gets it first, they believe will be totally dominant.
[01:37:49.052 --> 01:37:51.955]  So a lot of good things are happening in America, a lot of good things are happening in the world.
[01:37:52.816 --> 01:38:02.098]  A lot of good things are happening and awakening to globalism and basic facts like that, but not to the nanotech, the cross species and the rest of it.
[01:38:02.379 --> 01:38:04.659]  So we must force a debate about this.
[01:38:04.679 --> 01:38:06.700]  Now, Dr. Group, let's run through this.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.800]  Let's talk about this.
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:08.580]  Let's deal with this.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:13.161]  Because when I say we've produced aliens here on Earth, they make jokes about it.
[01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:15.282]  But if you cross a human with a pig, if you cross
[01:38:15.862 --> 01:38:16.022]  I don't
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.741]  Notice that allergies are off the charts.
[01:38:36.821 --> 01:38:38.622]  All these new gut diseases are off the charts.
[01:38:38.922 --> 01:38:40.002]  Cancer's off the chart.
[01:38:40.062 --> 01:38:41.983]  I mean, we're being killed by this right now.
[01:38:42.243 --> 01:38:44.544]  They're already making it where almost everybody's sterile.
[01:38:44.845 --> 01:38:48.666]  So you've got to go in and have genetic engineering so you can even have a child.
[01:38:48.907 --> 01:38:50.507]  But they admit it's not really a human.
[01:38:50.767 --> 01:38:52.648]  It's going to be designed by the techs.
[01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:59.131]  So if you think your smartphone is a Trojan horse, that's 50-year-old technology that was deployed to you, the slaves.
[01:38:59.572 --> 01:39:02.053]  They're now ready to start deploying the next gen.
[01:39:02.853 --> 01:39:06.657]  But first they've got to confuse you and say it's the right to be a woman if you think you're a man.
[01:39:07.077 --> 01:39:08.839]  Or it's the right to be a dog if you want.
[01:39:09.119 --> 01:39:15.526]  Or it's the right to get you all confused with hundreds of genders, getting you ready for the true trans humans.
[01:39:16.006 --> 01:39:16.847]  That is their plan.
[01:39:16.867 --> 01:39:18.269]  And if you want to do it, that's your issue.
[01:39:19.087 --> 01:39:24.252]  But what about the ethics and what about how it affects the rest of us, the new diseases this will give rise to?
[01:39:24.632 --> 01:39:26.694]  But they're only giving us stuff they've already had for decades.
[01:39:26.734 --> 01:39:30.637]  They've already got cures to global crises this is going to create.
[01:39:31.038 --> 01:39:34.240]  But you'll have to give up more humanity for each new patch.
[01:39:34.881 --> 01:39:37.162]  For the genetic nightmares they create.
[01:39:37.242 --> 01:39:38.202]  This is their master plan.
[01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:39.723]  Dr. Grip, please give a presentation.
[01:39:39.743 --> 01:39:48.906]  Well, Columbia University actually did a study on CRISPR and gene splicing technology, and they said that there can be hundreds of mutations formed.
[01:39:49.286 --> 01:39:55.988]  And the only reason we present all this information out here, Alex, is just to try to give people the information so they can be aware.
[01:39:57.250 --> 01:40:02.873]  Please, try not to eat genetically modified organisms and do your own research.
[01:40:03.373 --> 01:40:08.036]  We've been genetically modified, believe it or not, for the last hundred years.
[01:40:08.076 --> 01:40:22.284]  When you look at the genetics and epigenetics and how fluoride affects our genes and how stress affects our genes and, I mean, they're using viral DNA in flu shots and in vaccinations, so we're already being slowly introduced
[01:40:23.084 --> 01:40:23.805]  And change.
[01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:32.715]  See, the way that this whole shadow government or this shadow transgenics program works is they can't just do it all at once.
[01:40:32.735 --> 01:40:37.500]  I mean, they can't say, oh, come on, come in and line up and we're just going to give you an injection and slowly change you.
[01:40:37.981 --> 01:40:41.103]  They're slowly changing this over a long period of time.
[01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:45.645]  First of all, they're going to start with using animal DNA to make soldiers strong.
[01:40:45.685 --> 01:40:49.087]  Then they're going to start changing and altering the plants that we eat.
[01:40:49.407 --> 01:40:55.251]  So it's agricultural, big agricultural genetic processes.
[01:40:55.491 --> 01:40:56.832]  Then it's big pharmaceutical.
[01:40:56.852 --> 01:40:57.872]  Pharmacological crops.
[01:40:58.633 --> 01:40:59.013]  Crops.
[01:40:59.093 --> 01:41:00.754]  Then it's humans.
[01:41:01.474 --> 01:41:11.999]  And, you know, nobody is addressing the root cause of the problem out there, which is all of these individual things that are causing all of our diseases and causing all of our symptoms.
[01:41:12.019 --> 01:41:18.341]  And the globalists admit, though, they're going to make being human ugly and impossible to fully take control of the entire genome of the planet.
[01:41:18.762 --> 01:41:21.823]  What they're trying to do is control all life.
[01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:23.524]  That means plant life.
[01:41:23.604 --> 01:41:25.925]  So they own the patents for every single plant.
[01:41:26.505 --> 01:41:39.564]  They own all of the patents for this gene technology, like you said, the future, and this is, you could bring this up... This sounds like a very sophisticated alien takeover, and I'm not saying it is, but the globals for breakaway psychotics, this is what they're building.
[01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:44.253]  But the good news is, there's easy ways to avoid it, and be aware of it.
[01:41:44.273 --> 01:41:45.514]  And Monsanto cut the deal with CRISPR.
[01:41:45.534 --> 01:41:46.275]  Tell folks about that.
[01:41:46.755 --> 01:41:55.804]  So Monsanto, yeah, Monsanto just signed a deal for CRISPR technology, which was developed by the Broad Institute in Boston, and that's a whole other story with who funds all that information.
[01:41:55.824 --> 01:41:56.545]  Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:41:57.205 --> 01:42:10.701]  So, uh, so the CRISPR technology is a gene editing tool where you can go in and edit the genes for, you know, and they're saying that it's going to be used for autism, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, if you can go in and edit those, the p53 gene.
[01:42:12.142 --> 01:42:13.504]  Then you can get rid of disease.
[01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:16.108]  And again, they give you the mercury, they give you the adjuvants.
[01:42:16.148 --> 01:42:22.058]  Yes, you're predisposed genetically, if you're male, if you have those genetics, for it to cause an autoimmune response in the brain and the gut.
[01:42:22.599 --> 01:42:27.206]  So they claim they're going to just turn off the gene so that now the vaccine itself doesn't hurt you.
[01:42:27.466 --> 01:42:30.969]  They want, and this is happening, they want sterility.
[01:42:31.209 --> 01:42:37.355]  And it's really, what it is, is it's a mass attack on males especially.
[01:42:37.595 --> 01:42:45.782]  We're just getting neutered basically with all the endocrine disrupting chemicals in the water supply, all the contraceptives in the water supply.
[01:42:45.802 --> 01:42:46.703]  And they admit they're doing it!
[01:42:46.783 --> 01:42:49.265]  They're doing it, just like they admit they're killing the West in Christianity.
[01:42:49.646 --> 01:42:51.187]  All of this stuff is available.
[01:42:51.227 --> 01:42:56.572]  What gets me is I tell people, you know, they argue with me all the time, they say, what about all this, I like Hillary, or I like this.
[01:42:56.592 --> 01:42:57.152]  Do you understand?
[01:42:57.212 --> 01:43:02.137]  It's an admitted battle plan to end Christianity and wipe white people out Atlantic Monthly.
[01:43:02.697 --> 01:43:10.284]  So the secret societies, and if you want to say the Illuminati's, or if you want to say the globalists, the top few that are in to
[01:43:12.776 --> 01:43:24.583]  That are the ones behind all of these toxic, genetic, disease-causing methods that are introduced, whether it's from the air, whether it's from the water, whether it's from the food supply.
[01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:33.368]  They actually design it to where they want you to go out and eat in restaurants, and not grow your own food, and not cook your own food, and they want to get rid of all the hygiene.
[01:43:33.388 --> 01:43:38.732]  They're taking control of the normal human paradigm of being on top of your food, killing your own food, living there.
[01:43:39.372 --> 01:43:41.274]  They're training you to be totally domesticated.
[01:43:41.455 --> 01:43:47.402]  The Seed Vault is the third most heavily guarded structure in the world.
[01:43:47.422 --> 01:43:48.163]  And who funds that?
[01:43:48.183 --> 01:43:48.503]  The U.N.
[01:43:48.563 --> 01:43:49.404]  and the Rockefellers.
[01:43:49.765 --> 01:43:50.986]  And the Bill Gates Foundation.
[01:43:51.227 --> 01:43:52.548]  And Monsanto's part of it.
[01:43:52.588 --> 01:43:53.890]  And Syngenta.
[01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:58.495]  As a matter of fact, Syngenta was just bought by a Chinese company.
[01:43:59.016 --> 01:44:00.157]  Now that's a scary thought.
[01:44:00.218 --> 01:44:11.010]  Syngenta is the agricultural big producer of atrazine and also genetically modified crops who makes billions upon billions of billions of dollars every single year just like Monsanto is.
[01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:14.615]  And China has been signed on to the eugenics program with the globalists.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.140]  That's right.
[01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:24.346]  Now, let me tell you how easy it is to fix your genes, because we know that all of these things are gene-altering substances.
[01:44:24.466 --> 01:44:27.369]  But the body is smart, and you still do have stem cells.
[01:44:27.829 --> 01:44:29.550]  And that's why I explain it to them.
[01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:31.171]  This is the big secret the elites are doing.
[01:44:31.592 --> 01:44:32.572]  This is the big breakthrough.
[01:44:32.592 --> 01:44:32.793]  Tell them.
[01:44:33.593 --> 01:44:35.334]  Well, the big thing is it's not really big.
[01:44:35.374 --> 01:44:37.696]  It's been used for thousands of years and it's fasting.
[01:44:37.736 --> 01:44:45.021]  It's why individuals dating back in the Bible, they would fast for 40 days and you can regenerate your cells.
[01:44:45.161 --> 01:44:56.589]  USC just came out with groundbreaking research that a 72-hour water fast, you actually start producing stem cells and you regenerate your immune system in 72 hours.
[01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:00.231]  That's why children, when they're sick, explain it.
[01:45:00.311 --> 01:45:01.872]  That's why you're not supposed to eat.
[01:45:01.892 --> 01:45:04.453]  That's why when a baby's first born, they're not supposed to get real milk.
[01:45:04.753 --> 01:45:07.714]  The only cost from a few days is to activate even more of their cells.
[01:45:08.294 --> 01:45:08.834]  Exactly.
[01:45:08.934 --> 01:45:13.016]  So we have the solution inside our own bodies and it's going to be with fasting.
[01:45:13.036 --> 01:45:14.836]  I'm coming out with a whole new book on fasting.
[01:45:14.856 --> 01:45:20.979]  You can see intermittent fasting, how it's just doing tremendous things for people all over the world right now.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:33.495]  But explain what you were saying to me before the show, because I mean I know it's in the medical literature, but just hearing it, I mean you look five years younger, you look great, you've been fasting, intermittent fasting, you're about to do an 18-day fast, explain what happens when you start fasting.
[01:45:34.355 --> 01:45:42.960]  Well, it's a little bit hard, but what happens is, eventually, after about day four, and this is medical research, I'm not just making this up, it's called autophagy.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.762]  We're showing even mainline science publications off-screen, let's put it back up.
[01:45:45.802 --> 01:45:53.267]  So, autophagy means where your body actually goes into a phase... There it is, USC News, fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer.
[01:45:53.387 --> 01:45:53.647]  That's right.
[01:45:53.667 --> 01:45:58.110]  You were saying it literally doesn't just eat tumors, it eats old scars internally.
[01:45:58.530 --> 01:46:01.032]  So, I've done so much research and interviewed people,
[01:46:01.892 --> 01:46:14.976]  That have been fasting and looked back at the books and actually found out that the majority of doctors that were using fasting programs from the late 1800s all the way through the 1950s, their books were banned, their books were burned.
[01:46:14.996 --> 01:46:17.176]  It's extremely hard to find.
[01:46:17.256 --> 01:46:18.197]  Well, look at the Old Testament.
[01:46:18.277 --> 01:46:19.637]  I mean, the people are ordered to fast.
[01:46:20.237 --> 01:46:20.457]  Right.
[01:46:20.617 --> 01:46:24.038]  Thousands upon thousands of cases of every single disease.
[01:46:24.118 --> 01:46:25.259]  Take cancer for existence.
[01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:29.400]  And by the way, I'm not making any medical claims and saying fast for everybody to run out and start fasting.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.282]  But, cancer feeds on glucose.
[01:46:32.422 --> 01:46:37.447]  Now, what happens when you start fasting is after about four days on water, your digestive system shuts down.
[01:46:37.867 --> 01:46:44.313]  Now, do you know, Alex, that one of the biggest, we've talked about this all the time, is digestive issues, digestive issues.
[01:46:44.653 --> 01:46:50.719]  Do you know that one meal a day can take up to 24 to 72 hours to break down?
[01:46:51.019 --> 01:46:52.661]  That's one meal a day.
[01:46:53.061 --> 01:46:54.962]  How many meals are people eating right now?
[01:46:55.062 --> 01:46:57.943]  Cooked meals, bad meals, three, four, five meals a day.
[01:46:58.043 --> 01:47:04.925]  So basically your body's energy stores are having to work non-stop to take and digest the food.
[01:47:05.025 --> 01:47:09.007]  So when you take food completely out of the system and you start going on water by itself,
[01:47:09.807 --> 01:47:15.091]  The digestive system shuts down in about two or three days, depending on how, you know, everybody's different.
[01:47:15.451 --> 01:47:18.794]  And then the focus of your body is to start healing itself.
[01:47:19.134 --> 01:47:22.136]  And your body will start using your fat stores for energy.
[01:47:22.437 --> 01:47:25.419]  That's kind of like the ketogenic diets that people are doing right now.
[01:47:25.499 --> 01:47:27.060]  So your body goes into ketosis.
[01:47:27.461 --> 01:47:30.743]  It starts rapidly chewing up fat stores.
[01:47:30.823 --> 01:47:33.365]  A lot of the chemicals and toxins are stored in the fat tissue.
[01:47:33.745 --> 01:47:35.727]  Stem cells are stored in the fat tissue.
[01:47:36.047 --> 01:47:51.797]  There's a clinic in Thailand right now, Dr. Richard D'Andrea, who's making great success using your own stem cells that he's getting from the umbilical, so you can start producing these stem cells that will heal and regenerate your tissues.
[01:47:51.897 --> 01:47:55.620]  And so, autophagy, the body will start chewing up abnormal tissue.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.802]  People that have scars all the way down their arms or their legs,
[01:47:59.262 --> 01:48:01.923]  Gone completely when the body starts chewing all that up.
[01:48:02.183 --> 01:48:07.425]  Organ problems, the body starts regenerating the organs, starts producing all these stem cells again.
[01:48:08.306 --> 01:48:23.212]  Amazing that all we need, when you look at medicine out there, and all of the natural medicine out there, that's why we've been such a big fan of cleansing the body, avoiding all the chemicals that are going to cause epigenetic changes in the system, that are going to cause disease.
[01:48:24.244 --> 01:48:27.207]  Well, I know you're involved with a TV production and you're going to have a book soon.
[01:48:27.507 --> 01:48:29.109]  I know this is in the mainline literature.
[01:48:29.129 --> 01:48:31.091]  It doesn't mean I've actually acted on much of this.
[01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:41.341]  I am more and more acting on it because it's the only way, just like you go into a fever or you fast to get rid of a virus or bacteria, you do the intermittent fasting or you don't eat.
[01:48:41.881 --> 01:48:42.061]  Yeah.
[01:48:58.173 --> 01:48:59.033]  This is a separate issue.
[01:48:59.053 --> 01:49:01.054]  The media loves to attack probiotics when we sell it.
[01:49:01.254 --> 01:49:05.955]  They're even attacking me selling coffee, saying coffee's a scam, that coffee doesn't actually make you wake up.
[01:49:05.975 --> 01:49:07.456]  I'm not kidding.
[01:49:07.476 --> 01:49:10.757]  D Magazine and others said that I'm a scammer for selling coffee, high-quality coffee.
[01:49:11.157 --> 01:49:12.877]  Okay, Kooks, we're not allowed to sell anything.
[01:49:12.917 --> 01:49:13.878]  Only big corporate media.
[01:49:14.598 --> 01:49:16.778]  But MycoZX is back in stock.
[01:49:17.178 --> 01:49:18.579]  It's hard ingredients to get.
[01:49:18.599 --> 01:49:20.419]  I'm gonna skip this break so we have more time.
[01:49:20.699 --> 01:49:21.880]  It's been sold out for
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.120]  I don't know, four or five months.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.101]  It comes with a biome defense probiotic.
[01:49:26.181 --> 01:49:31.442]  Tell us about both these products you developed exclusively for Infowarslife.com.
[01:49:31.862 --> 01:49:44.784]  And again, not some panacea, but what probiotics do, why they're needed, and then why MycoZX is the antifungal, anti-yeast probiotic, and why that gets into the whole missing link that normal probiotics aren't covering.
[01:49:44.804 --> 01:49:49.525]  Because this is, I mean, I've got so many people that I know personally that have irritable bowel, Crohn's-type stuff.
[01:49:50.444 --> 01:49:50.865]  I don't know.
[01:50:12.788 --> 01:50:18.631]  And it kills the good bacteria, basically, and then all these really toxic invaders move in those spaces.
[01:50:19.251 --> 01:50:20.911]  The fungus creates these slime walls.
[01:50:21.232 --> 01:50:22.672]  Spend some time on this, Dr. Group.
[01:50:23.312 --> 01:50:35.257]  Well, first of all, only about one out of every 50 of those reviews that come in, we can actually post online because of the claims that people are making and the incredible differences.
[01:50:35.418 --> 01:50:41.000]  Even though it's their free speech, the free speech has been hurt so bad in America, most of these we can't even show you.
[01:50:41.755 --> 01:50:45.258]  So it all starts in the gut, and hopefully all your listeners know that by now.
[01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.740]  Bill Gates is obsessed with it.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:56.346]  We've been saying it for 20 years when we were originally on a research team trying to develop and find and present the root cause of all disease, which we did.
[01:50:57.267 --> 01:51:01.130]  And health begins in the gut as well as disease begins in the gut.
[01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:02.972]  And when your gut is unhealthy,
[01:51:04.005 --> 01:51:07.707]  Every system in your body becomes depressed.
[01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:16.332]  Your cardiovascular system, your mental acuity, the way that you think, the way that your immune system works, everything is linked to the gut.
[01:51:16.393 --> 01:51:19.955]  So when we started developing these products, we started looking at
[01:51:20.675 --> 01:51:22.417]  What is coming in?
[01:51:22.437 --> 01:51:32.967]  And we found that the standard American diet, the gluten, the genetically modified foods, all the chemicals, heavy metals, were destroying the natural probiotics.
[01:51:33.387 --> 01:51:38.412]  And pretty much everybody out there had very little of the good probiotics.
[01:51:39.193 --> 01:51:47.176]  What they had was they had overgrowth of the bad organisms in their bowel, which is the Candida and different types of bacteria.
[01:51:47.196 --> 01:51:51.377]  And this has gone from being a conspiracy theory 20 years ago to mainline science.
[01:51:51.457 --> 01:51:57.039]  People even get fecal bacteria transfusions now because their guts are so dead.
[01:51:57.779 --> 01:51:58.079]  Right.
[01:51:58.619 --> 01:52:05.322]  And talking about transhumanism and being able to manipulate the genes is they're doing it through the gut.
[01:52:05.362 --> 01:52:08.703]  They're doing it because that's how you get into the bloodstream.
[01:52:08.743 --> 01:52:18.226]  You can literally tag things now with organisms and genetically modified in the BT toxin, for example, and they can alter the genetic code.
[01:52:18.286 --> 01:52:22.307]  Again, for those that don't know, BT toxin, the plant grows its own pesticide, then you eat it.
[01:52:22.688 --> 01:52:23.768]  No wonder your liver's dying.
[01:52:23.888 --> 01:52:29.871]  But the good thing is, there's always a positive and a negative, but the positive is the body heals extremely fast.
[01:52:29.911 --> 01:52:34.574]  When you just avoid all these things, and you have to take a good probiotic.
[01:52:34.954 --> 01:52:39.897]  It took us like 7 to 10 years to develop the Biome Defense because we looked at every single probiotic.
[01:52:39.937 --> 01:52:42.058]  For 5 years I was saying, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[01:52:42.118 --> 01:52:42.599]  This isn't hype.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:49.843]  What we're explaining here is, most people have no real gut flora left because of all the toxins.
[01:52:50.044 --> 01:52:57.529]  You have to continually replace it now, and it has made my life and everybody else's in my life... I mean, people roll their eyes who have irritable bowel.
[01:52:57.569 --> 01:52:59.090]  I go, hey, take this.
[01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:01.131]  In two weeks, they're like, it's all over.
[01:53:01.691 --> 01:53:02.612]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:53:03.333 --> 01:53:12.139]  Namely, one person that's got any benefit or any gut disorder that they've had has gone away by going the allopathic route.
[01:53:12.956 --> 01:53:13.436]  Zero.
[01:53:13.756 --> 01:53:22.978]  They're put on medications, their bowel condition worsens, the medical profession doesn't tell them... But your gut operates off bacteria in every species!
[01:53:23.498 --> 01:53:29.659]  It's the bacteria in cows, in humans, in cats, in everything, no matter what type of stomach you've got, or intestines, it's always bacteria.
[01:53:29.819 --> 01:53:30.459]  That's a fact!
[01:53:30.899 --> 01:53:32.019]  But they call it a conspiracy theory.
[01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:37.660]  It doesn't matter if you've got degrees from MIT and everywhere else, and a bunch of other degrees, the media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:39.360]  That's right.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.481]  I mean, literally, they say we cannot sell coffee.
[01:53:41.541 --> 01:53:42.041]  It's a fraud.
[01:53:42.472 --> 01:53:43.392]  That's right, that's right.
[01:53:43.912 --> 01:53:45.793]  I've been a research scientist for a long time.
[01:53:45.853 --> 01:53:52.635]  I am MIT alumni and I can tell you that I do research all the time and I want the best.
[01:53:52.755 --> 01:54:08.761]  And Alex, anybody, any of your listeners or anybody in the mainstream media that's watching this, you can go to any other probiotic company right now and you can ask them if their probiotics have maltodextrin, silicon dioxide, and all those toxic fillers and excipients that they're not
[01:54:09.661 --> 01:54:13.125]  That they're not required to list on the label because they're under 1%.
[01:54:14.846 --> 01:54:16.448]  We did that and I did that.
[01:54:16.528 --> 01:54:24.135]  I wanted to develop a probiotic and I found out that all of these things are cultured on genetically modified maltodextrin and all these other fillers and excipients and everything.
[01:54:24.515 --> 01:54:28.739]  I went to the main, there's only like five or six main huge... You went to Europe?
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.901]  Because we knew it would be a bestseller.
[01:54:30.961 --> 01:54:32.963]  When I met you five years ago you were trying to develop this.
[01:54:33.123 --> 01:54:34.404]  Yeah, and they didn't want to work with me.
[01:54:34.444 --> 01:54:43.667]  They laughed in my face and they said, oh yeah, we're not going to, oh no, you can buy our probiotics individually by the ton or you can buy them by the kilos, but they're going to come with the silicon dioxide.
[01:54:43.687 --> 01:54:44.668]  They're going to come with the magnesium.
[01:54:44.688 --> 01:54:49.610]  But now the new hot thing in Europe has the, they're starting to have these at clinics though that are the way you want them.
[01:54:50.612 --> 01:54:51.292]  Well, that's right.
[01:54:51.352 --> 01:54:57.195]  I mean, we're the first company in the United States to produce a probiotic formula with none of those fillers.
[01:54:57.235 --> 01:54:58.895]  And see, we don't even hype how good this is.
[01:54:58.915 --> 01:55:03.137]  So people know Biome Defense is the very best, way lower than stuff you can get at expensive clinics.
[01:55:03.217 --> 01:55:05.138]  It's 30% off when you get it with MycoZx.
[01:55:05.178 --> 01:55:11.500]  Now, tell folks about the MycoZx, because the probiotic just goes in and displaces what the bad bacteria and has the healthy flora.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.221]  But what does the MycoZx do?
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.201]  Vision problems running rampant.
[01:55:16.461 --> 01:55:18.542]  Skin problems running rampant right now.
[01:55:18.862 --> 01:55:19.342]  Children.
[01:55:19.703 --> 01:55:23.605]  Every single child below 10 is suffering from something.
[01:55:23.765 --> 01:55:32.389]  I personally have not had someone tell me, except maybe an organic child, that they're not suffering from allergies or some sort of toxins right now.
[01:55:32.409 --> 01:55:33.750]  That's exploding!
[01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:36.091]  Just search engine, man dies from fungus.
[01:55:36.391 --> 01:55:37.431]  Woman dies of fungus.
[01:55:37.912 --> 01:55:38.552]  Brain tumors.
[01:55:38.652 --> 01:55:42.254]  I don't know about people who suddenly have family with brain tumors that's fungus in the brain.
[01:55:43.092 --> 01:55:44.052]  Right now people are dying.
[01:55:44.072 --> 01:55:45.293]  Bats are all dying from fungus.
[01:55:45.313 --> 01:55:46.993]  Because of Candida auris right now.
[01:55:47.093 --> 01:55:48.774]  Fungus, yeast.
[01:55:48.914 --> 01:55:49.794]  Why is it exploding?
[01:55:49.854 --> 01:55:53.216]  Why is it suddenly just growing everywhere?
[01:55:53.236 --> 01:55:55.917]  I have a couple theories.
[01:55:55.977 --> 01:55:58.618]  Number one is our biological terrain has changed.
[01:55:58.658 --> 01:55:59.718]  We've become acidic.
[01:55:59.758 --> 01:56:00.738]  The foods are changing.
[01:56:00.778 --> 01:56:02.019]  The soil is changing.
[01:56:02.799 --> 01:56:10.985]  That's why you're seeing, you know, when you look at organisms, like Louis Pasteur said on his deathbed, he said the germ is nothing, the terrain is everything, right?
[01:56:11.005 --> 01:56:15.349]  Because we had the germ theory a long time ago, and we used to think that germs cause disease.
[01:56:15.769 --> 01:56:16.710]  Well, that's wrong.
[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:20.653]  It's not the germ, it's the terrain and the environment in which the germ can live.
[01:56:20.993 --> 01:56:30.801]  If you look at the poisoning of the air that's happened, the poisoning of the water that's happened, the poisoning of the food supply that's happened... It's a chain reaction, plus all these artificial buildings to grow in.
[01:56:31.101 --> 01:56:37.967]  These fungus and mold and yeast and bacteria, they thrive in these very acidic, toxic environments.
[01:56:38.227 --> 01:56:43.611]  Look, just don't wash your dishes in your kitchen for a week and just let them sit there and see what grows on them.
[01:56:43.631 --> 01:56:45.753]  It's mold, it's not even the bacteria, it's the fungus.
[01:56:45.853 --> 01:56:49.396]  And again folks, MycoZx, the latest level of probiotic.
[01:56:49.436 --> 01:56:55.000]  It's got all these key herbs and compounds that are absolutely changing people's lives and it supports the broadcast.
[01:56:55.301 --> 01:56:56.101]  It's a win-win-win.
[01:56:56.161 --> 01:56:58.103]  Don't let the media tell you the gut isn't important.
[01:56:58.343 --> 01:57:00.084]  Don't let them tell you that probiotics aren't important.
[01:57:00.104 --> 01:57:00.645]  I guarantee you,
[01:57:00.925 --> 01:57:05.107]  Most of those CNN and Washington Post people attacking us, they're taking our products, we know.
[01:57:05.407 --> 01:57:06.467]  And let's expand on that.
[01:57:06.888 --> 01:57:10.149]  Bezos owns Whole Foods that sells stuff that isn't even as good as this.
[01:57:10.509 --> 01:57:12.250]  They don't want us to be able to fund ourselves.
[01:57:12.610 --> 01:57:13.931]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:14.171 --> 01:57:14.611]  Free shipping.
[01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:15.631]  A lot of other specials.
[01:57:15.651 --> 01:57:16.252]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:16.272 --> 01:57:17.852]  Briefly, tell folks what's in MycoZx.
[01:57:24.395 --> 01:57:40.828]  Michael ZX has a unique blend of herbs that have been proven effective for a long period of time to target the external lining of multi-faceted different types of fungus and mold and not... They take your gut over and create a slime wall.
[01:57:41.690 --> 01:57:47.154]  So it's called a biofilm, and they create a biofilm, and you have to actually break that biofilm down.
[01:57:47.194 --> 01:57:48.295]  They start farming in there.
[01:57:48.595 --> 01:57:56.181]  And they start farming, and a lot of that also depends on what you're, you know, when you take in a lot of high fructose corn syrup, and you change the, you take it.
[01:57:56.281 --> 01:58:00.384]  Everybody's seen mold growing in the attic, or growing under the, or cold dark places, or warm places.
[01:58:00.684 --> 01:58:01.845]  That's what's growing in the guts.
[01:58:03.863 --> 01:58:05.564]  You've got to knock it out.
[01:58:05.684 --> 01:58:13.307]  If people had a microscope that they could just turn on of what's going on in their gut right now, they would be sickened, most of the people out there.
[01:58:13.347 --> 01:58:22.070]  Because when you put high fructose corn syrup, then you put gluten, then you put genetically modified foods, and then you look at all the yeast overgrowth, and the mold, and all of the different compounds.
[01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:24.250]  No wonder your immune system's whacked out.
[01:58:24.690 --> 01:58:26.271]  That's why you're sick.
[01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:27.772]  That's why you're low in energy.
[01:58:27.812 --> 01:58:28.472]  That's why
[01:58:29.432 --> 01:58:32.995]  You need to take... Because your engine is being fed crap.
[01:58:33.356 --> 01:58:33.716]  Exactly.
[01:58:34.277 --> 01:58:36.839]  Well, this is like STP fuel additive, basically.
[01:58:37.159 --> 01:58:39.361]  Infowarslive.com, help support the broadcast.
[01:58:39.601 --> 01:58:41.403]  Second hour, third hour, tons of news.
[01:58:41.663 --> 01:58:43.545]  Coming up with Dr. Group, another special guest.

[01:59:20.783 --> 01:59:23.705]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.

[01:59:56.189 --> 02:00:02.096]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.515 --> 02:00:22.482]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.105 --> 02:00:24.906]  And Dr. Groot.
[02:00:25.246 --> 02:00:28.311]  You know, let's play one more of these memes.
[02:00:28.371 --> 02:00:29.913]  Here's one again that Rob Dood just put out.
[02:00:29.953 --> 02:00:30.454]  Brand new.
[02:00:30.514 --> 02:00:31.415]  Born into the world.
[02:00:31.455 --> 02:00:31.856]  Here it is.
[02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:53.118]  We've got some good compilation ones.
[02:00:53.138 --> 02:00:59.344]  I know Darren put one together that will come out of the next segment and play two of them together, one that he and Harrison put together.
[02:00:59.584 --> 02:01:05.669]  We have a $20,000 prize going out of the CNN is terror, CNN is fake news pool.
[02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:12.315]  It was going to be $2,500 prizes, but I'm now having a $20,000 prize for the best meme that promotes info wars and what we're doing here.
[02:01:12.655 --> 02:01:14.117]  But obviously Trump destroying CNN.
[02:01:14.657 --> 02:01:15.618]  Or other MSM.
[02:01:15.678 --> 02:01:17.740]  You know what, let's widen the field.
[02:01:18.041 --> 02:01:20.403]  How bad of a backlash was that?
[02:01:21.484 --> 02:01:22.866]  They don't know the season they're in.
[02:01:23.086 --> 02:01:24.287]  And that's what's incredible about humans.
[02:01:24.327 --> 02:01:27.090]  People ask me, why are you so crazed?
[02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:27.971]  Why do you get so upset?
[02:01:28.512 --> 02:01:29.353]  My new daughter.
[02:01:30.558 --> 02:01:32.999]  Is the most beautiful creature I've ever seen in my life.
[02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:34.279]  I'm in love with her.
[02:01:34.999 --> 02:01:35.960]  And she's an angel.
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.781]  And I mean, I'm sitting there looking at her and I'm like, I'm going to fight harder.
[02:01:41.101 --> 02:01:41.941]  I'm going to be stronger.
[02:01:42.001 --> 02:01:42.862]  I'm going to get healthier.
[02:01:43.242 --> 02:01:47.963]  I'm going to be even more focused to build a better world for her and the people she's going to live with in the future.
[02:01:48.123 --> 02:01:50.444]  Because if I love her, I love you and everybody else.
[02:01:51.284 --> 02:01:53.486]  And they know Gardasil's a sterilant.
[02:01:53.526 --> 02:01:55.187]  They're giving it to all the Hispanics in Mexico.
[02:01:55.467 --> 02:01:56.668]  Where's La Raza and Mecha?
[02:01:56.908 --> 02:01:58.069]  Oh, well, they're overpopulated.
[02:01:58.089 --> 02:01:58.409]  Kill them.
[02:01:58.810 --> 02:02:01.692]  No, I don't want them coming here to be illegals and be my enemy.
[02:02:01.792 --> 02:02:04.674]  I want them to be free and prosperous and Mexico be so nice.
[02:02:04.794 --> 02:02:05.895]  They move here, I move there.
[02:02:06.455 --> 02:02:08.897]  But again, I am in a death battle.
[02:02:08.917 --> 02:02:10.218]  People ask how I have this much energy.
[02:02:10.458 --> 02:02:12.160]  Megyn Kelly asked me what drugs I was on.
[02:02:13.021 --> 02:02:13.842]  And I said, I don't use drugs.
[02:02:13.882 --> 02:02:15.143]  She was kind of like, really, you don't?
[02:02:15.163 --> 02:02:17.925]  I don't know what that meant, but I thought she was trying to get me into saying I was on drugs.
[02:02:18.506 --> 02:02:23.850]  Folks, I have hundreds of articles I see every week about human-animal chimeras with no rights.
[02:02:24.150 --> 02:02:26.673]  You talked about people you know in research labs, I've talked to them too.
[02:02:27.093 --> 02:02:31.497]  You see humanoids, they're like 80% gorilla, 80% pig, and they're talking?
[02:02:32.277 --> 02:02:33.618]  And this is highly, go ahead.
[02:02:33.798 --> 02:02:36.521]  Case Law School in 2006 was hired to develop law
[02:02:40.484 --> 02:02:44.345]  For the future of transgenic organisms.
[02:02:44.526 --> 02:02:47.267]  And they're already here, and we're saying we want to force a debate!
[02:02:47.467 --> 02:02:52.348]  What rights are they gonna... like, do you get rights as a human if you have 50% DNA?
[02:02:52.689 --> 02:02:55.870]  Like, what are the rights that are gonna be... We need to make this illegal.
[02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:57.210]  This needs to be illegal.
[02:02:57.230 --> 02:02:58.331]  It needs to be illegal.
[02:02:58.351 --> 02:03:02.612]  They're talking about making it illegal to make child pedophile robots.
[02:03:03.472 --> 02:03:03.813]  Okay.
[02:03:04.413 --> 02:03:05.693]  Okay.
[02:03:05.773 --> 02:03:06.534]  Make that illegal.
[02:03:06.594 --> 02:03:07.054]  But, but, but...
[02:03:07.961 --> 02:03:10.243]  What about the human splice with animals?
[02:03:10.283 --> 02:03:11.664]  I mean, this is beyond pedophilia.
[02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:13.205]  Why is fluoride legal?
[02:03:13.625 --> 02:03:15.126]  Why is glyphosate legal?
[02:03:15.467 --> 02:03:18.169]  Why are artificial colors legal?
[02:03:18.309 --> 02:03:20.030]  Undebated that glyphosate grows cancer.
[02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:22.752]  You want to make the biggest name... It's like Miracle-Gro for cancer.
[02:03:22.972 --> 02:03:23.432]  Exactly.
[02:03:23.493 --> 02:03:26.895]  To the healthcare system, you want to like, look, this is ridiculous.
[02:03:26.915 --> 02:03:29.578]  The healthcare system, all this stuff, it's a bailout.
[02:03:29.638 --> 02:03:32.060]  They're giving insurance companies billions of dollars.
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.821]  Address the root cause of the problem.
[02:03:34.082 --> 02:03:34.982]  Executive order.
[02:03:35.222 --> 02:03:36.183]  Ban glyphosate.
[02:03:36.464 --> 02:03:37.244]  Executive order.
[02:03:37.504 --> 02:03:38.465]  Ban GMOs.
[02:03:38.725 --> 02:03:39.446]  Executive order.
[02:03:39.646 --> 02:03:41.007]  Ban artificial sweeteners.
[02:03:41.228 --> 02:03:42.749]  Man-made chemicals in products.
[02:03:42.989 --> 02:03:43.510]  Phthalates.
[02:03:44.190 --> 02:03:47.432]  You know the root cause of why we're getting all this disease.
[02:03:47.492 --> 02:03:48.893]  I love my children.
[02:03:48.973 --> 02:03:50.234]  We've got to stop this group.
[02:03:50.654 --> 02:03:51.394]  We've got to do it.
[02:03:51.955 --> 02:03:53.196]  But again, they want to make jokes about it.
[02:03:53.216 --> 02:03:54.416]  I mean, it's like the gay frog thing.
[02:03:54.436 --> 02:03:59.339]  20-something years, they've admitted that most of the frogs and amphibians and fish are dying.
[02:03:59.699 --> 02:04:01.380]  They're horribly deformed.
[02:04:01.621 --> 02:04:03.061]  And then it's just a big joke to Colbert.
[02:04:03.081 --> 02:04:06.564]  I've noticed all his attacks make fun of us and how our genetics are being manipulated.
[02:04:06.744 --> 02:04:10.126]  They want to make a joke about that with the public so no one cares.
[02:04:10.967 --> 02:04:13.929]  There was an article that came out either today or yesterday that I saw.
[02:04:14.329 --> 02:04:19.192]  One-fifth of all fish are showing transgenic traits right now.
[02:04:19.252 --> 02:04:20.333]  You have male fish.
[02:04:20.353 --> 02:04:22.514]  It's actually 84% of smallmouth bass.
[02:04:23.014 --> 02:04:24.595]  Yeah, across the board though.
[02:04:24.695 --> 02:04:25.416]  One-fifth, you're right.
[02:04:25.676 --> 02:04:30.338]  Because there's that much of the contraceptives being flushed down the toilet.
[02:04:30.358 --> 02:04:31.259]  And that's just one thing.
[02:04:31.859 --> 02:04:32.760]  That's just one thing.
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:34.881]  I mean, you know... But let's expand on that then.
[02:04:36.202 --> 02:04:37.643]  Again, it grows all these cancers.
[02:04:37.683 --> 02:04:38.303]  It's doing all this.
[02:04:38.343 --> 02:04:39.564]  It's causing us to be infertile.
[02:04:41.249 --> 02:04:49.317]  And then they can come on the back end with their gene-splicing technology and get rid of it until you get the next disease, and then you're gonna have to pay for the gene-splicing technology to get rid of that.
[02:04:49.337 --> 02:04:49.958]  And here's what's crazy!
[02:04:49.998 --> 02:04:58.007]  And then you're gonna have a thousand mutations from each gene-splicing thing, so... Monsanto, a thousand new opportunities, admits their plans to take over, me God, see?
[02:04:58.407 --> 02:04:59.628]  We're not even theorizing!
[02:05:00.029 --> 02:05:00.770]  What a nightmare!
[02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:01.651]  We've gotta stop it!
[02:05:03.444 --> 02:05:09.607]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:05:09.987 --> 02:05:12.869]  Dr. Group, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:05:13.209 --> 02:05:18.412]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:05:18.832 --> 02:05:24.795]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:05:24.955 --> 02:05:28.077]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:05:28.237 --> 02:05:29.678]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[02:05:29.878 --> 02:05:34.022]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:05:34.222 --> 02:05:37.085]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:05:37.165 --> 02:05:38.727]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:05:38.827 --> 02:05:41.990]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:44.613]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:05:44.893 --> 02:05:45.854]  It's in powder form.
[02:05:45.954 --> 02:05:48.657]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:05:48.837 --> 02:05:49.438]  I take this.
[02:05:49.558 --> 02:05:51.259]  This is the product that I take.
[02:05:51.359 --> 02:05:53.341]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:05:54.142 --> 02:05:54.942]  We fight the globalists.
[02:05:54.962 --> 02:05:55.822]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:06:02.084 --> 02:06:05.724]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[02:06:07.385 --> 02:06:13.046]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:06:13.746 --> 02:06:17.627]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:06:18.610 --> 02:06:20.832]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:06:20.912 --> 02:06:22.072]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:06:22.092 --> 02:06:25.315]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:06:26.275 --> 02:06:26.615]  Or more.
[02:06:26.715 --> 02:06:28.677]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:06:29.137 --> 02:06:30.618]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:06:30.718 --> 02:06:34.080]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:35.942]  It's actually scary.
[02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:46.907]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:06:47.908 --> 02:07:00.714]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[02:07:03.717 --> 02:07:08.441]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[02:08:07.399 --> 02:08:12.101]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[02:08:13.082 --> 02:08:16.984]  It came to me when I tried to classify your species.
[02:08:17.644 --> 02:08:21.246]  I realized that you're not actually mammals.
[02:08:22.802 --> 02:08:30.524]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
[02:08:30.624 --> 02:08:32.325]  But you humans do not.
[02:08:33.085 --> 02:08:36.346]  You move to an area and you multiply.
[02:08:36.366 --> 02:08:40.527]  You multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[02:08:41.728 --> 02:08:46.569]  And the only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[02:08:52.452 --> 02:08:57.277]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[02:08:57.297 --> 02:08:59.018]  Do you know what it is?
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:01.080]  A virus.
[02:09:03.422 --> 02:09:05.684]  Human beings are a disease.
[02:09:05.705 --> 02:09:08.627]  A cancer of this planet.
[02:09:08.687 --> 02:09:09.989]  You are a plague.
[02:09:19.031 --> 02:09:22.563]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:09:23.145 --> 02:09:24.870]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:27.256 --> 02:09:31.858]  The truth is, humans can build our new environments and are actually improving things in many areas.
[02:09:31.958 --> 02:09:34.639]  But when we slovenly do it, we toxically do it, we are bad.
[02:09:35.139 --> 02:09:41.722]  But instead, the globalists have everybody focused on carbon dioxide that we know is the lowest ever recorded in the last hundred years in planetary history.
[02:09:42.402 --> 02:09:46.503]  The plants are dying, there's not enough carbon dioxide, not enough oxygen, deserts are spreading.
[02:09:47.044 --> 02:09:50.185]  Because when plants don't get enough carbon dioxide, they die.
[02:09:50.545 --> 02:09:52.446]  They need that as much as water or more.
[02:09:52.486 --> 02:09:53.666]  This is mainline science.
[02:09:54.326 --> 02:09:55.507]  And it's crazy how we found
[02:09:56.633 --> 02:10:03.555]  The oil, which is toxic as well, right in time to start terraforming or geoengineering the planet back to where we need.
[02:10:03.595 --> 02:10:07.296]  A lot of evidence shows Mars lost its atmosphere.
[02:10:08.076 --> 02:10:21.699]  So they're focusing on something we need, a trace gas, to tax it, while rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet, and admittedly, in their own words, endangering everything, with mainline scientists saying, we're already creating alien life forms here.
[02:10:23.217 --> 02:10:25.999]  Similar to the Andromeda Strain, why are the elites doing it?
[02:10:26.019 --> 02:10:30.542]  But as you said, the power trip of wanting to find these technologies first, Dr. Group.
[02:10:31.223 --> 02:10:33.004]  It's called playing God.
[02:10:33.684 --> 02:10:34.785]  That's what it boils down to.
[02:10:34.865 --> 02:10:35.686]  It's playing God.
[02:10:36.246 --> 02:10:46.173]  They know that if they can create a sterile society, which by the way they are doing, you can type in Google, you can look anywhere online, you will see sterility in males, low sperm count in males,
[02:10:46.693 --> 02:10:49.074]  One out of, you know, five males now can conceive.
[02:10:49.115 --> 02:10:50.555]  They don't have, they're not sterile.
[02:10:51.016 --> 02:10:54.418]  And the generations, each generation, it gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:10:54.858 --> 02:11:01.362]  You know, if you can create a sterile world, then everybody is going to have, it just all makes sense, Alex.
[02:11:01.382 --> 02:11:03.783]  When you look at the... Because the corporation is mother now.
[02:11:03.823 --> 02:11:07.385]  You go to it and it makes a drug and... They want the patented on the gene.
[02:11:07.425 --> 02:11:09.186]  They want to be able to control life.
[02:11:09.466 --> 02:11:11.467]  They want to be able to control agriculture.
[02:11:11.487 --> 02:11:13.649]  They want to be able to control everything.
[02:11:14.329 --> 02:11:15.090]  It's in their hands.
[02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:20.213]  And people go see something like Blade Runner, the new one, and lick their lips like it's cool and cutting edge.
[02:11:20.553 --> 02:11:22.014]  We already have replicants.
[02:11:22.294 --> 02:11:23.635]  We're already replicants.
[02:11:23.935 --> 02:11:35.982]  They knew 50 years ago, Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics, that if they gave you GMO and added certain chemicals that they could manipulate in rats and change the generations 2, 3, 4 out to any trait they wanted.
[02:11:36.242 --> 02:11:39.384]  So the GMO is a genetically engineered nanotech
[02:11:39.804 --> 02:11:40.564]  It's a plan!
[02:11:40.644 --> 02:11:41.704]  It's a plan?
[02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:08.256]  That's been planned for a long period of time to create dependency.
[02:12:08.416 --> 02:12:10.499]  If you want to have a baby, you have to go to them.
[02:12:10.539 --> 02:12:12.982]  You can pick the traits.
[02:12:13.562 --> 02:12:14.824]  They'll do it in a test.
[02:12:14.844 --> 02:12:17.407]  And notice Bill Gates is saying, don't let all the Muslims in.
[02:12:17.887 --> 02:12:20.770]  Give me money, I'll take care of them with vaccines.
[02:12:21.210 --> 02:12:23.413]  He goes, hey, you don't want the Muslims?
[02:12:23.513 --> 02:12:24.654]  Let me roll then!
[02:12:24.674 --> 02:12:29.098]  In fact, I've had little messages sent to me like, just get out of the way, Jones.
[02:12:29.659 --> 02:12:33.443]  Anything that has genes in it, in DNA, they want full control.
[02:12:33.603 --> 02:12:34.143]  The plants?
[02:12:35.051 --> 02:12:43.797]  The bacteria, the fungus, they're using a lot of the bacteria and the fungus and the viruses and everything to get and to use them as carriers.
[02:12:43.837 --> 02:12:47.639]  They use them as carriers to go in and actually replace or to cut or to supply.
[02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:58.006]  For those that don't know, that's 30-year-old technology where they have engineered viruses that are really nanotech that go in a quote anti-stress vaccine and then eat the areas of the brain associated with higher brain waves.
[02:12:58.327 --> 02:13:01.309]  So now you're not depressed, you're also not at higher levels, you're not angry anymore.
[02:13:01.629 --> 02:13:04.831]  And I know folks that have had military people who are given these shots, they're gone.
[02:13:05.251 --> 02:13:06.112]  But we can stop it.
[02:13:06.212 --> 02:13:09.654]  I mean, the thing is, you know, we can make a difference.
[02:13:09.694 --> 02:13:10.955]  We are making a difference.
[02:13:11.035 --> 02:13:12.416]  We're not trying to be negative.
[02:13:12.536 --> 02:13:14.497]  We have to admit how bad it is, though.
[02:13:14.637 --> 02:13:18.580]  You have to know what's going on out there to know what the solution is.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:20.021]  So you have a situation.
[02:13:20.321 --> 02:13:22.403]  It could be a bad situation, a good situation.
[02:13:22.543 --> 02:13:23.704]  And then you have a solution.
[02:13:23.764 --> 02:13:25.585]  It can be a good situation or a bad situation.
[02:13:25.965 --> 02:13:27.206]  We know what's going on.
[02:13:27.266 --> 02:13:30.168]  This is out there for anybody to find.
[02:13:30.508 --> 02:13:32.790]  You know, it's not like I'm coming on and making this stuff up.
[02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:34.671]  It's a warning, though.
[02:13:34.711 --> 02:13:35.251]  It's a warning.
[02:13:35.271 --> 02:13:36.552]  This is the direction.
[02:13:36.712 --> 02:13:37.993]  This is what's going on.
[02:13:38.133 --> 02:13:39.634]  This is what they want.
[02:13:39.794 --> 02:13:41.175]  They want that full control.
[02:13:41.195 --> 02:13:42.296]  And let's expand.
[02:13:42.636 --> 02:13:43.536]  Let's expand on this.
[02:13:44.317 --> 02:13:49.900]  About a month ago, one of the experimental secret NASA aircraft, a small shuttle, landed back on Earth.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:50.581]  We can put it on screen.
[02:13:51.201 --> 02:13:56.005]  And they had men out there in spacesuits all around it in case a microorganism from space was on it.
[02:13:56.325 --> 02:13:57.366]  Give me a break, folks.
[02:13:57.786 --> 02:14:00.588]  They do that, but they've got thousands of labs we know of.
[02:14:00.668 --> 02:14:01.709]  China, as you know, is the leader.
[02:14:01.829 --> 02:14:02.430]  India as well.
[02:14:02.610 --> 02:14:02.950]  Russia.
[02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:03.330]  The U.S.
[02:14:03.851 --> 02:14:17.822]  Randomly splicing everything just to see what'll happen, and then open-air planting corn, wheat, and other stuff that has genetically engineered viruses in it, open-air, and super fungus, and super bacteria, and super...
[02:14:18.362 --> 02:14:19.443]  Look at this article right here.
[02:14:20.244 --> 02:14:24.449]  Superalgae that they admit is totally changing the environment.
[02:14:24.509 --> 02:14:25.531]  What is going on here?
[02:14:25.551 --> 02:14:28.114]  It's like the island of Dr. Moreau or X-Men.
[02:14:28.775 --> 02:14:32.479]  They do all the X-Men, but that is transhumanism.
[02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:35.302]  You're literally creating... But you don't turn into Superman.
[02:14:35.322 --> 02:14:36.424]  You grow a giant tumor and die.
[02:14:37.577 --> 02:14:38.778]  Right, right, right.
[02:14:38.878 --> 02:14:55.031]  So the good news is, like I was saying, cleansing the body, detoxification, repairing your bowel, not eating the genetically modified foods, not taking in all the phthalates, purifying your water, drinking pure clean water, it all comes back to simplicity and the things God created.
[02:14:55.051 --> 02:15:06.081]  Okay, you look at all this stuff that man is creating to control the population and control your genes and control the food that you eat, well just the solution is going back to God's things!
[02:15:06.621 --> 02:15:09.163]  You know, God, clean the air in your house where you sleep.
[02:15:09.223 --> 02:15:10.784]  You know, clean the water.
[02:15:10.804 --> 02:15:11.745]  Drink pure water.
[02:15:11.765 --> 02:15:13.966]  And let me expand the minutes we have left before the next guest joins us.
[02:15:13.986 --> 02:15:14.466]  This is amazing.
[02:15:14.486 --> 02:15:15.467]  Dr. Rip, you're going to be back on.
[02:15:15.747 --> 02:15:21.271]  The Daily News is not going to tape an emergency report for us on the genetic Armageddon they're trying to set up, but we can stop it.
[02:15:21.671 --> 02:15:28.216]  Just like we exposed Soros and globalism in the New World Order, now we're starting to win because we were super negative and truthful.
[02:15:28.576 --> 02:15:33.040]  A lot of people say, oh, I don't want any stress, kind of this new agey thing of just believe everything's going to be okay.
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:33.280]  No.
[02:15:33.701 --> 02:15:40.867]  Work towards peace and justice and open freedom and fight the evil and then, as Thomas Jefferson said, tyranny will vanish.
[02:15:40.907 --> 02:15:44.531]  But it's only when good men do nothing and women do nothing that evil grows.
[02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:45.392]  So that's why.
[02:15:45.492 --> 02:15:46.433]  Support the broadcast.
[02:15:46.453 --> 02:15:47.133]  Support yourself.
[02:15:47.433 --> 02:15:49.435]  You may be dug in a hole like I was at 280 pounds.
[02:15:50.296 --> 02:15:52.558]  And I'm still not perfect, but at 235, a lot better.
[02:15:52.918 --> 02:16:04.145]  Just start that journey of getting healthier, getting better, moving forward, you know, praying to God for guidance, and getting products like Biome Defense is really probably the best probiotic you can get out there.
[02:16:04.165 --> 02:16:10.530]  I mean, the massive research, the MycoZx, new cutting-edge probiotic that goes after all the other garbage that the Biome Defense doesn't hit.
[02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:13.472]  Spend a few minutes telling folks again about MycoZx.
[02:16:15.373 --> 02:16:24.841]  I'm discounting it 30% off even though it's been sold out for almost 5 plus months because the ingredients are so hard to get and so hard to source because they're so organic and so well crafted and pure.
[02:16:25.281 --> 02:16:26.942]  Why is MycoZx important?
[02:16:27.002 --> 02:16:29.705]  What does it do in the gut that normal probiotics don't do?
[02:16:30.492 --> 02:16:44.288]  Well, you know, using the Oxy-Powder to clean out your gut really good and get rid of that biofilm, and then using the MycoZX because over the last 15 years we are really seeing an overgrowth, an epidemic of yeast, fungus and mold.
[02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:46.369]  We're good to go.
[02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:21.254]  blend of herbs that will address multifaceted strains of different types of fungus, mole, mycoplasms.
[02:17:21.314 --> 02:17:23.255]  Now you have more Gallon's disease.
[02:17:23.275 --> 02:17:24.755]  You have all of these fungal things.
[02:17:25.075 --> 02:17:29.497]  Medical profession, by the way, is still not even testing for this, which I feel sorry for most people that walk in.
[02:17:29.517 --> 02:17:31.638]  But there are mainline doctors saying it's real.
[02:17:31.878 --> 02:17:35.499]  There are mainline doctors, but it's still not in the diagnostic process.
[02:17:35.539 --> 02:17:36.660]  Is it a nanotech fungus?
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:39.382]  Because I know they're trying to splice fungus with machines.
[02:17:39.422 --> 02:17:41.503]  Well, they found fungus in chemtrails.
[02:17:41.544 --> 02:17:44.726]  They're finding all these new types of fungus that are everywhere.
[02:17:44.826 --> 02:17:50.070]  Fungus now, they just came out a couple weeks ago and said fungus is now airborne.
[02:17:50.090 --> 02:17:57.155]  Notice how they're telling us in the movie, what's the movie about deep space travel?
[02:17:57.195 --> 02:17:57.696]  Interstellar.
[02:17:58.196 --> 02:18:00.618]  Notice it's a fungus in the air that kills everything.
[02:18:01.158 --> 02:18:02.319]  They're telling you what's coming.
[02:18:04.050 --> 02:18:06.852]  They always tell you what's coming.
[02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:12.715]  It's always the little things that you can't see that is what you really need to look at.
[02:18:12.835 --> 02:18:18.579]  For example, the X2, which is one of the things that I always say everybody needs.
[02:18:19.867 --> 02:18:30.849]  That will help wake you up and detoxify and decalcify your pineal gland and open up your reality again to understanding things.
[02:18:31.629 --> 02:18:33.769]  Look at the far left.
[02:18:33.789 --> 02:18:35.150]  They're going crazy right now.
[02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:38.330]  Talk about, oh, they have solutions for everything.
[02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:41.411]  They're the ones that really like Monsanto.
[02:18:41.431 --> 02:18:46.312]  A lot of the original left are smart on things like that, but they're totally crazed now.
[02:18:46.652 --> 02:18:47.612]  They're totally crazed.
[02:18:49.252 --> 02:18:50.172]  There's a solution.
[02:18:50.412 --> 02:18:51.212]  Clean your body.
[02:18:51.473 --> 02:18:52.433]  Take good products.
[02:18:52.593 --> 02:18:55.513]  And the best part of it is you're supporting the mission.
[02:18:55.834 --> 02:18:56.814]  You're supporting the info.
[02:18:56.834 --> 02:18:57.454]  Let me expand on that.
[02:18:57.474 --> 02:18:58.714]  You're supporting the revolution.
[02:18:58.734 --> 02:18:59.254]  You just hit me.
[02:18:59.614 --> 02:19:02.915]  They're upset about globalism, the new world order, a big time of changes here.
[02:19:02.935 --> 02:19:03.695]  They're all afraid.
[02:19:04.035 --> 02:19:04.796]  Everybody's concerned.
[02:19:04.816 --> 02:19:05.296]  You should be.
[02:19:05.576 --> 02:19:10.917]  And the media gets them to project their subconscious real concerns, their sixth sense, onto Trump.
[02:19:11.537 --> 02:19:12.597]  So the world's changing.
[02:19:12.617 --> 02:19:13.478]  People are freaked out.
[02:19:13.758 --> 02:19:18.579]  And so they're training them to project it onto us when we're people actually trying to fix things.
[02:19:19.318 --> 02:19:21.139]  Yeah, we have the solution.
[02:19:21.179 --> 02:19:21.819]  That's our job.
[02:19:21.859 --> 02:19:23.119]  We spent 20 years.
[02:19:23.679 --> 02:19:27.361]  Alex has been out there promoting all this stuff, telling you what the truth is.
[02:19:28.201 --> 02:19:28.741]  And you know what?
[02:19:28.761 --> 02:19:34.843]  You should actually have a section on your site where people can go and say the truth about Sandy Hook, the truth about 9-11.
[02:19:34.883 --> 02:19:40.385]  We broke on Monday the gay sex orgies of the Vatican and forced them to cover it.
[02:19:40.865 --> 02:19:44.226]  This is like everybody's, oh, you're such a conspiracy theorist talking about all this.
[02:19:44.486 --> 02:19:44.766]  No.
[02:19:45.006 --> 02:19:46.366]  Here's all the facts right here.
[02:19:46.466 --> 02:19:47.226]  This is true.
[02:19:47.326 --> 02:19:48.907]  Just go do your research.
[02:19:49.667 --> 02:19:51.467]  And find out for yourself what's going on.
[02:19:51.487 --> 02:19:52.867]  It's amazing how much they lie to us.
[02:19:52.887 --> 02:19:53.888]  Dr. Groob, thank you so much.
[02:19:53.908 --> 02:19:54.988]  You'll be on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:19:55.288 --> 02:19:55.568]  Stay with us.
[02:19:55.588 --> 02:19:58.809]  We have a special guest joining us for folks fleeing California.
[02:19:59.129 --> 02:20:00.229]  Key announcements straight ahead.
[02:20:14.468 --> 02:20:26.575]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[02:20:27.896 --> 02:20:43.406]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[02:20:44.366 --> 02:20:57.952]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[02:20:59.013 --> 02:21:05.976]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[02:21:06.874 --> 02:21:09.756]  That our species has never even imagined.
[02:21:10.596 --> 02:21:18.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[02:21:19.741 --> 02:21:27.965]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[02:21:28.786 --> 02:21:33.068]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[02:21:34.169 --> 02:21:36.130]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[02:21:37.182 --> 02:21:51.325]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, people of the world.
[02:21:51.845 --> 02:22:01.787]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[02:22:02.787 --> 02:22:05.588]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[02:22:07.409 --> 02:22:09.570]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[02:22:10.570 --> 02:22:14.811]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[02:22:15.171 --> 02:22:16.092]  It's why they hate me.
[02:22:16.352 --> 02:22:17.232]  It's why they hate you.
[02:22:17.512 --> 02:22:20.293]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[02:22:20.513 --> 02:22:26.375]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[02:22:26.935 --> 02:22:32.137]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead,
[02:22:33.075 --> 02:22:37.257]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[02:22:37.277 --> 02:22:40.638]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[02:22:41.059 --> 02:22:47.121]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[02:22:47.622 --> 02:22:54.725]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[02:22:55.595 --> 02:22:57.396]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[02:22:57.436 --> 02:23:03.641]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbricks Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[02:23:04.321 --> 02:23:09.985]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[02:23:10.826 --> 02:23:16.230]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:19.192]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:23:19.212 --> 02:23:21.473]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[02:23:26.167 --> 02:23:29.028]  Long-lasting sale in the history of Infowars.
[02:23:29.708 --> 02:23:37.991]  Because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[02:23:38.391 --> 02:23:41.412]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together.
[02:23:42.353 --> 02:23:44.614]  Because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[02:23:45.114 --> 02:23:51.756]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[02:23:52.316 --> 02:23:54.117]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[02:24:28.467 --> 02:24:30.487]  Paul Schabo is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:24:31.468 --> 02:24:34.568]  Then we've got, in the fourth hour, Anthony Cumia hosting.
[02:24:35.369 --> 02:24:39.950]  If I go over his bio, it'll take this whole segment, but I saw this article in the London Guardian.
[02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:44.251]  Your place or mine, Texas liberals and California conservatives swapped states.
[02:24:44.311 --> 02:24:47.311]  He ran for Congress last year there in the Los Angeles area.
[02:24:47.391 --> 02:24:47.931]  Didn't win.
[02:24:48.211 --> 02:24:49.892]  He thought, we better move to Texas.
[02:24:50.776 --> 02:24:56.639]  Well that's a lot better than all the trendies that are, you know, in failed Hollywood coming here and then trying to replicate the same thing.
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.721]  He's a pro-life, pro-family, pro-Christian conservative Republican.
[02:25:00.041 --> 02:25:00.181]  He's 42.
[02:25:01.804 --> 02:25:06.368]  And he heads up Shabo Strategies, LLC, Securities International.
[02:25:06.688 --> 02:25:14.255]  He's also an adjunct professor teaching American Government, California Baptist University, Iraq War Veterans, serving for the first Office of Naval Intelligence.
[02:25:14.295 --> 02:25:15.917]  Later he worked with the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:25:15.937 --> 02:25:20.441]  He's a fully qualified Information Dominance Warfare Officer, top security clearance, all that stuff.
[02:25:20.461 --> 02:25:22.062]  And I'll go over the rest of his bio, it won't take too long.
[02:25:22.442 --> 02:25:24.745]  Became the Commissioner of the California State Parole Board.
[02:25:25.405 --> 02:25:36.107]  While working at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Services, the Clinton and Bush administrations, where he was eventually promoted to a White House Senior Advisor for Law Enforcement, Justice, and Drug Control Operations.
[02:25:36.487 --> 02:25:41.628]  He's the founder of several organizations that promote American values, youth, membership, and deterrence.
[02:25:41.988 --> 02:25:51.130]  He's also the author of the counterterrorism book, Ethereal Battle Against Evil, or Eternal Battle Against Evil, and the author of a number of books, including the
[02:25:52.952 --> 02:25:58.660]  Cartel Organizational Resiliency Against All Odds, conservativemove.com.
[02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:02.645]  And let me tell you, we're having major groups of Californians move here.
[02:26:03.026 --> 02:26:04.768]  Most of them are just economic refugees.
[02:26:05.109 --> 02:26:07.632]  But a lot of people are conservatives, they're libertarians.
[02:26:08.393 --> 02:26:08.653]  I don't know.
[02:26:29.431 --> 02:26:34.015]  They're trying to get liberals to leave Texas to go to California, which is just amazing.
[02:26:34.116 --> 02:26:36.438]  So, we make jokes about California breaking off.
[02:26:36.458 --> 02:26:37.739]  I think it already has.
[02:26:37.799 --> 02:26:39.301]  So, Paul, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:26:40.602 --> 02:26:41.883]  Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[02:26:41.943 --> 02:26:43.044]  Great to be with you and your audience.
[02:26:43.605 --> 02:26:48.830]  We got a few minutes here before we go to break and have a long segment, but just break down what brought you to this epiphany.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:50.180]  Sure.
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:51.622]  Well, I'm a father with four kids.
[02:26:51.722 --> 02:26:54.646]  I was born and raised in California, 43 years.
[02:26:54.706 --> 02:26:57.389]  My wife and I are Christian conservatives.
[02:26:57.590 --> 02:27:06.381]  We watched our state turn from what was once a red state, the state of Reagan, the state of Nixon, some of the best schools a generation ago, some of the safest streets, best jobs.
[02:27:07.001 --> 02:27:09.842]  To now many parts looking like a third world country.
[02:27:09.962 --> 02:27:11.043]  Crime is out of control.
[02:27:11.403 --> 02:27:12.843]  Good jobs are hard to find.
[02:27:12.863 --> 02:27:16.424]  It's just, it has become a cesspool in many areas.
[02:27:16.525 --> 02:27:23.787]  We tried to stay and fight, but the areas overrun by liberals from top down, very difficult to make an impact.
[02:27:25.968 --> 02:27:29.109]  And the liberals seem to be angry they can't pull the rest of country down with them.
[02:27:30.325 --> 02:27:31.145]  Well, they're going to try.
[02:27:31.205 --> 02:27:39.208]  And I think if anything, you know, we as conservatives, Republicans around this country should look at California as the canary in the coal mine.
[02:27:39.628 --> 02:27:46.170]  When you look and you dig down into these inner cities, whether it's Los Angeles or San Bernardino or other areas,
[02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:47.931]  They are just devastated.
[02:27:48.131 --> 02:27:54.495]  And it's not only the outskirts, we're talking the inner cities, which are just basically war zones.
[02:27:54.636 --> 02:27:57.377]  And these are because of liberal policies in California.
[02:27:57.718 --> 02:28:05.363]  They let out so many people out of prison for these so-called non-violent offenses, and they're only looking at their last commitment offense.
[02:28:05.803 --> 02:28:11.730]  Not, you know, forget the fact they got a home invasion robbery and assaults and all those things on their record.
[02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:17.276]  The state has just got a different ideology than those of us with a conservative mindset.
[02:28:17.597 --> 02:28:20.260]  So when you live in California, you either got to take it
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:23.422]  Or you gotta say, look, time to move.
[02:28:23.782 --> 02:28:31.427]  We fought, we tried to fight, but I'll tell you what, we learned a lesson, and that is, you can't help people who don't want to help themselves.
[02:28:31.447 --> 02:28:43.216]  And that's my next question, long segment coming up, but as Illinois collapses, even though it has a lot of great people, as California collapses, or do you think it will collapse, will it ever dawn on them, or do we have to almost build up defenses
[02:28:44.056 --> 02:28:46.399]  And not let people immigrate from California to Illinois.
[02:28:46.419 --> 02:28:48.141]  I mean, you can't do that constitutionally.
[02:28:48.201 --> 02:28:49.743]  But, I mean, where is this going?
[02:28:49.803 --> 02:28:56.290]  Because as the disease of, like, Venezuela and North Korea, as communism grows, they never learn.
[02:28:56.310 --> 02:28:58.113]  They just try to attack everything like cancer.
[02:28:59.056 --> 02:29:00.318]  You know, it is very odd.
[02:29:00.338 --> 02:29:12.232]  As a professor of government and political science, when you look historically, for example, whenever there's a rise in crime and it's happened in American history, you'll see a change in political parties.
[02:29:12.593 --> 02:29:15.536]  But you don't see that happening in these ultra-liberal states.
[02:29:15.757 --> 02:29:17.299]  Everything can go down the tubes.
[02:29:17.799 --> 02:29:21.581]  And the people still elect the exact same party over and over again.
[02:29:21.901 --> 02:29:23.902]  So I think we're in uncharted waters.
[02:29:24.182 --> 02:29:31.046]  However, I do think through our website, Conservative Movement, what we're doing, we're advocating to help people have a much better life.
[02:29:31.106 --> 02:29:35.809]  And we think that'll resonate back in California for a good, positive revolution down the road.
[02:29:35.849 --> 02:29:36.429]  Fingers crossed.
[02:29:36.889 --> 02:29:37.149]  Wow.
[02:29:37.689 --> 02:29:39.750]  Alright, by the way, they just told me, Anthony Comey is on vacation.
[02:29:39.810 --> 02:29:42.091]  It's Owen Schroer, always doing a great job doing the fourth hour.
[02:29:42.531 --> 02:29:42.791]  Wow.
[02:29:43.311 --> 02:29:51.194]  We're going to be talking more with our guest, Paul Schabo, on the other side of this break and talk about this conservativemove.com.
[02:29:51.534 --> 02:29:53.755]  It just gets everybody discussing the larger issue.
[02:29:53.935 --> 02:29:55.536]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.476 --> 02:29:59.137]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:09.613]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[02:30:10.414 --> 02:30:13.356]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[02:30:14.016 --> 02:30:16.818]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[02:30:17.459 --> 02:30:22.322]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[02:30:22.682 --> 02:30:28.986]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[02:30:29.346 --> 02:30:34.470]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:38.591]  That's why I recommend Emerick's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[02:30:39.171 --> 02:30:46.994]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[02:30:47.574 --> 02:30:51.915]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[02:30:52.255 --> 02:30:53.716]  No petroleum-based ingredients.
[02:30:56.697 --> 02:31:10.384]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:31:10.744 --> 02:31:18.228]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality, known probiotics that have been proven
[02:31:18.948 --> 02:31:23.952]  to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:31:24.893 --> 02:31:36.122]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:31:36.783 --> 02:31:42.748]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:31:43.508 --> 02:31:51.893]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:31:52.513 --> 02:32:00.718]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:32:03.618 --> 02:32:09.501]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:32:09.701 --> 02:32:10.922]  The contest is simple.
[02:32:11.202 --> 02:32:16.464]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:32:16.664 --> 02:32:23.848]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:32:23.988 --> 02:32:30.571]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:30.671 --> 02:32:40.535]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:32:40.736 --> 02:32:48.279]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:32:48.479 --> 02:32:58.411]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[02:32:58.571 --> 02:33:01.916]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[02:33:02.036 --> 02:33:02.897]  This is Kit Daniels.
[02:33:14.111 --> 02:33:14.812]  You found it.
[02:33:15.313 --> 02:33:17.977]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[02:33:18.378 --> 02:33:20.181]  It's the Infowar.
[02:33:20.461 --> 02:33:22.925]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.985 --> 02:33:23.686]  Look, it's simple.
[02:33:26.075 --> 02:33:37.079]  Western civilizations produce so much wealth and so much freedom, people become spoiled brats, and then you get people that want to manage domesticated populations as political tools and skim money off the top.
[02:33:37.099 --> 02:33:42.861]  That's happened in Chicago, it's happened in LA, it's happened in hundreds of other towns and cities, and the people know what they're doing.
[02:33:43.341 --> 02:33:46.943]  You have to realize that the Democrats knowingly engage in election fraud.
[02:33:47.923 --> 02:33:50.784]  They want to declare the last election null and void.
[02:33:52.622 --> 02:33:59.967]  They want to say Russians ran it all and then have Homeland Security, under Obama's last executive order, come in and have new elections that they oversee.
[02:34:00.367 --> 02:34:02.769]  We'll never have a real election again like Venezuela, folks.
[02:34:03.470 --> 02:34:04.871]  And I know that sounds dastardly.
[02:34:05.251 --> 02:34:07.212]  That's Atlantic Monthly's plan.
[02:34:08.053 --> 02:34:09.414]  And that's one of the elite publications.
[02:34:10.655 --> 02:34:11.575]  Elite cockroaches.
[02:34:11.795 --> 02:34:13.277]  But this is what they really mean to do.
[02:34:13.357 --> 02:34:14.998]  So we're in dire straits.
[02:34:15.158 --> 02:34:22.163]  If we can just teach basic prosperity and go, you came here from Venezuela, you don't want to live under communism, right?
[02:34:23.393 --> 02:34:26.634]  But instead, folks coming here from all over, they're not even taught that.
[02:34:27.274 --> 02:34:33.757]  They're taught racial division, cultural division, cultural envy, exponential envy.
[02:34:33.857 --> 02:34:43.321]  It's designed, but again, we've contained the colleges, we've contained the globalists, we've contained the social engineering, so now it's incinerating itself.
[02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:44.281]  Our guest is a professor.
[02:34:44.301 --> 02:34:46.622]  I can get his take on what's happening on the colleges.
[02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:48.050]  That's
[02:35:07.568 --> 02:35:09.090]  I mean, you've got the floor for a few minutes here.
[02:35:09.390 --> 02:35:12.835]  Tell us about the movement, where it's going, what's happening to universities.
[02:35:12.875 --> 02:35:14.257]  You're a smart guy, you've been involved.
[02:35:14.537 --> 02:35:16.560]  Highest levels at the White House, multiple White Houses.
[02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:18.563]  Where do you see this trajectory going?
[02:35:19.619 --> 02:35:23.323]  Well, obviously, I'm greatly concerned for our country, the direction we're going.
[02:35:23.363 --> 02:35:24.644]  I think we see a lot of apathy.
[02:35:25.465 --> 02:35:29.168]  And we started Conservative Move almost as an accident.
[02:35:29.188 --> 02:35:39.078]  When my wife and I made the decision in November, December to move here to North Texas, we had a going away party, and we invited a lot of our friends and family.
[02:35:39.578 --> 02:35:40.980]  And so many of them said to us,
[02:35:41.693 --> 02:35:42.254]  We're envious.
[02:35:42.294 --> 02:35:43.435]  We wish we could go with you.
[02:35:43.735 --> 02:35:45.237]  We thought about doing the same thing.
[02:35:45.677 --> 02:35:46.738]  We'd like to get out.
[02:35:47.138 --> 02:35:54.205]  And when we got here, we realized so many people had already left California and were living around here for the same reasons we were.
[02:35:54.665 --> 02:35:56.807]  And so we then decided to create a business model.
[02:35:57.168 --> 02:36:05.736]  We wanted to help conservative families, not just in California, but liberal bastions all across America, from New York to San Francisco, and say, look,
[02:36:06.531 --> 02:36:09.615]  You can live a better life and Conservative Move will help you.
[02:36:09.655 --> 02:36:21.171]  And so what we do is we look at the families who contact us through our website at conservativemove.com and we link them up with a conservative realtor and we have other realtors around the country who can help them sell their home
[02:36:21.471 --> 02:36:21.871]  We're good to go.
[02:36:37.407 --> 02:36:42.730]  The public schools out here have a 98.2% graduation rate, which is pretty remarkable.
[02:36:43.251 --> 02:36:44.031]  Booming jobs.
[02:36:44.151 --> 02:36:47.894]  Toyota closed their North American headquarters in California.
[02:36:47.934 --> 02:36:49.995]  They've moved it out here to Plano.
[02:36:50.295 --> 02:36:53.137]  So you're seeing a major rush leaving California.
[02:36:53.157 --> 02:36:58.100]  But those are either A, businesses that can, and two, B, families that can.
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:02.703]  And we have seen for a long time Texas doing a good job at
[02:37:03.855 --> 02:37:05.896]  Marketing towards businesses to move.
[02:37:06.337 --> 02:37:10.980]  What we did is we said, why don't we now market towards families and simply tell them the story.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.161]  Look, if we can do it, so can you.
[02:37:13.541 --> 02:37:16.443]  We've only been around as conservative move now for about three weeks.
[02:37:16.823 --> 02:37:20.545]  Over a thousand families have signed up about 40 different states.
[02:37:21.246 --> 02:37:24.248]  And I would just say your site, what you're doing is a bellwether.
[02:37:24.288 --> 02:37:25.128]  That's why it's important.
[02:37:25.168 --> 02:37:26.509]  Sample of what's happening.
[02:37:27.730 --> 02:37:29.051]  Keep going, but then I have a few other questions.
[02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:30.050]  Sure.
[02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:30.870]  No, absolutely.
[02:37:30.930 --> 02:37:32.651]  So we're excited.
[02:37:32.911 --> 02:37:41.533]  But I'll tell you, when you when you hear the personal stories on our website, people fill out a contact form and many will leave a personal story about their reasons why.
[02:37:42.134 --> 02:37:46.755]  And almost to an individual or a family, they feel the same.
[02:37:46.895 --> 02:37:50.876]  It's that where they were born and raised, they don't recognize it anymore.
[02:37:51.056 --> 02:37:52.196]  They look at their community.
[02:37:52.277 --> 02:37:53.237]  It's not the same.
[02:37:54.117 --> 02:37:56.978]  Many are locked down in their homes, afraid to go out on their streets.
[02:37:57.618 --> 02:38:07.805]  Well listen, I'll be honest, I've been going out to California my whole life, and parts of it like Santa Cruz are ultra beautiful, and Northern California too, but being in L.A., being in other areas, it is like zombie land.
[02:38:08.125 --> 02:38:13.389]  There's something different about the people, no matter what color they are, they look like their souls have been sucked out.
[02:38:13.809 --> 02:38:14.910]  Last time I was at the big L.A.
[02:38:14.970 --> 02:38:18.152]  airport, and just in and around town, what is going on there?
[02:38:19.093 --> 02:38:22.055]  Well, in California, you've got to remember, cost of living is ridiculous.
[02:38:22.175 --> 02:38:25.957]  The ultra-liberal legislators there, they have a super-majority in California.
[02:38:26.417 --> 02:38:27.698]  They just raised the gas tax.
[02:38:27.878 --> 02:38:30.460]  I think $0.12 to $0.14 is going to kick in in October.
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:32.961]  So they continue to harm the working class.
[02:38:33.521 --> 02:38:35.903]  And don't they get there's a mass exodus out?
[02:38:36.690 --> 02:38:37.711]  No, they don't care.
[02:38:37.931 --> 02:38:40.953]  They honestly, and Governor Jerry Brown, these folks, they don't get it.
[02:38:40.973 --> 02:38:41.533]  They don't care.
[02:38:41.814 --> 02:38:44.335]  They're beholden to the unions and special interests.
[02:38:44.716 --> 02:38:45.956]  So here's who they're harming.
[02:38:46.197 --> 02:38:50.439]  They're not harming the ultra-left liberal that lives along the coast and breathes the good air.
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:53.682]  They're harming the majority of Americans who live in the inland part of the state.
[02:38:53.702 --> 02:38:54.903]  So it's pure conscious elitism.
[02:38:54.943 --> 02:38:55.603]  They're all tax
[02:38:55.723 --> 02:38:56.064]  Absolutely.
[02:39:11.961 --> 02:39:13.261]  And that's a scary place to go.
[02:39:13.281 --> 02:39:17.123]  I think here in America, at least, we're giving people an opportunity to leave.
[02:39:17.163 --> 02:39:21.204]  They can be, it might be a joke in a sense, but refugees from California.
[02:39:21.244 --> 02:39:23.444]  Look, it's so backwards, Alex.
[02:39:23.485 --> 02:39:33.868]  In California, the legislature will give tax breaks and free college to illegal aliens, yet you have American citizens who can't get the same service if they're out of state.
[02:39:34.828 --> 02:39:38.329]  You have sanctuary cities that are exploding across, not just
[02:39:38.689 --> 02:39:39.489]  You know, California.
[02:39:54.657 --> 02:39:59.921]  In Austin, they don't know what... Now, I run a lot of conservative libertarian Californians that are the coolest people ever.
[02:39:59.961 --> 02:40:11.909]  Hell, as you know, 100 years ago, 50 years ago, I mean, my great-great-grandmother and grandfather almost moved to LA, you know, back in the, you know, back in the 20s and, you know, 30s and stuff, and were almost Californians, but they wanted to come back to Texas.
[02:40:12.169 --> 02:40:18.373]  California was more rugged for folks who don't know that even Texas, I mean, it was the real 49ers, it's had this horrible transformation.
[02:40:18.674 --> 02:40:23.517]  How do we keep Texas, not with folks like you coming in, but from the contagion
[02:40:23.857 --> 02:40:25.238]  They don't know why they left.
[02:40:25.278 --> 02:40:27.980]  They bring the exact same crap here once they get here.
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:34.644]  And that is a very legitimate concern that we hear from a lot of different people that people might be leaving for whatever reason.
[02:40:34.684 --> 02:40:39.527]  They can't find a job, but then they come to Texas and they're going to vote for the same crazy Democrat policies.
[02:40:39.607 --> 02:40:41.808]  And so we absolutely have a concern about that.
[02:40:42.188 --> 02:40:46.951]  My message to the Republican Party is don't become complacent here or anywhere.
[02:40:47.372 --> 02:40:47.852]  Look at what
[02:40:48.032 --> 02:40:49.553]  It happened in California.
[02:40:49.733 --> 02:40:51.374]  We basically lost it.
[02:40:58.257 --> 02:40:59.378]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:40:59.418 --> 02:41:01.200]  We saw a lot of that happening in California.
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:03.302]  We saw that happening in our election as well.
[02:41:04.723 --> 02:41:07.786]  I honestly don't even think we should label the Democrats, Democrats.
[02:41:07.806 --> 02:41:09.748]  These are ultra-left progressives.
[02:41:10.109 --> 02:41:12.691]  The old school Blue Dog Kennedy Democrats are gone.
[02:41:12.991 --> 02:41:14.973]  They don't control the Democrat Party today.
[02:41:14.993 --> 02:41:16.575]  They're conscious parasites.
[02:41:19.272 --> 02:41:22.013]  What do you expect to happen to California though?
[02:41:22.354 --> 02:41:25.535]  Because even on the coast with the rich elites, they realize how dangerous it is.
[02:41:25.875 --> 02:41:28.517]  Is there any point that California might wake up?
[02:41:29.428 --> 02:41:31.568]  You know, it may very well wake up.
[02:41:31.729 --> 02:41:33.789]  I just don't see it happening in my generation.
[02:41:34.109 --> 02:41:36.069]  I think the voters there are stuck and locked.
[02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:41.211]  I think it's going to be the next generation coming up, if anybody there that is still left to fight.
[02:41:41.571 --> 02:41:46.332]  But, you know, when you go around L.A., California, you see the free phone booths everywhere.
[02:41:46.692 --> 02:41:50.893]  You have more imports of people from welfare than any other state.
[02:41:51.133 --> 02:41:56.134]  So there's a growing segment of the population that is very dependent on the government.
[02:41:56.594 --> 02:41:58.275]  But it looks like Day of the Dead.
[02:41:58.295 --> 02:42:08.361]  I mean, like, no matter where you go, there's just giant mobs of zombie-like homeless people completely whacked out of their brains, just shuffling around.
[02:42:09.081 --> 02:42:09.781]  It's hellish!
[02:42:10.362 --> 02:42:11.963]  Well, they have homeless encampments.
[02:42:12.003 --> 02:42:14.224]  Look, I served in Iraq and I've seen ten cities.
[02:42:15.044 --> 02:42:18.186]  I was shocked to see tent cities now sprout up in California.
[02:42:18.506 --> 02:42:22.608]  You have them in San Francisco, you have them in LA, you have them in San Bernardino.
[02:42:22.688 --> 02:42:26.670]  They're the little shanty towns along these riverways, and it shocks me to see that.
[02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:31.392]  It is un-American, and yet these are happening in the most liberal cities in America.
[02:42:31.592 --> 02:42:35.474]  Why is it the liberal cities that are like stinking fetid rat holes?
[02:42:35.534 --> 02:42:38.196]  I mean, they can turn a great town in a decade into a hellhole.
[02:42:38.256 --> 02:42:38.896]  What is it about it?
[02:42:40.103 --> 02:42:42.786]  I don't know, but they continue that trend across America.
[02:42:42.806 --> 02:42:52.274]  And I think where we always have the right footing is in the debate and asking the simple question, what kind of communities do we want to see children raised in?
[02:42:52.634 --> 02:42:54.476]  I was a patrol deputy in San Bernardino.
[02:42:54.536 --> 02:42:55.637]  I worked in Los Angeles.
[02:42:55.657 --> 02:43:03.124]  When you talk to the minority communities that are hard hit and devastated that have been there for such a long time, they can't put their kids on the street to play anymore.
[02:43:03.424 --> 02:43:04.245]  They would love to have
[02:43:06.326 --> 02:43:10.027]  California wants to bring in more refugees.
[02:43:10.047 --> 02:43:10.507]  80% male.
[02:43:11.068 --> 02:43:18.130]  I have stacks of articles here where in Sweden they can't even have outdoor concerts anymore because the Muslims are raping everybody.
[02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:19.211]  I mean, what is that?
[02:43:20.351 --> 02:43:25.113]  I just don't think California right now understands what it means to be America.
[02:43:25.593 --> 02:43:29.835]  They are looking at third world countries as examples of what to become and what to be.
[02:43:30.175 --> 02:43:32.396]  So they aspire to become Calcutta?
[02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:34.751]  I would imagine so.
[02:43:34.851 --> 02:43:42.237]  And in many of these cities, if you look at them, you'll see more foreign flags flying than you do American flags, which absolutely floored me.
[02:43:42.598 --> 02:43:47.962]  If you have a Mexico versus USA soccer game in Southern California, guess what?
[02:43:48.603 --> 02:43:52.306]  The Mexico team has about 10 to 1 the supporters on the street than your home
[02:43:52.746 --> 02:44:01.952]  Hollywood's done a job on us.
[02:44:02.012 --> 02:44:08.896]  I mean, I got Atlantic Monthly right here saying Christianity's going down, America's going down, Trump, they said Trump, you'll never stop us, we're gonna kill America.
[02:44:09.236 --> 02:44:11.757]  I mean, they even admit they want to kill the country.
[02:44:11.957 --> 02:44:12.438]  It's not like...
[02:44:13.576 --> 02:44:15.677]  And it's not like they want to replace it with something better.
[02:44:16.358 --> 02:44:23.642]  They want to turn it into something like Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea, but I guess that's what the ruling elites want.
[02:44:23.682 --> 02:44:28.025]  I want to play you a clip here, because the good news is, it's not radicalization.
[02:44:28.225 --> 02:44:38.072]  Conservatives, libertarians, patriots of every race, color, creed are waking up to the fact that we're in an existential war with globalists and their giant cohorts, radical Islam, third world, you name it.
[02:44:39.231 --> 02:44:40.092]  This aired last week.
[02:44:40.472 --> 02:44:42.074]  They called it terrorist in the news.
[02:44:42.494 --> 02:44:47.278]  A chilling National Rifle Association ad gaining traction online appears to be an open call for violence.
[02:44:47.298 --> 02:45:01.890]  But you watch it, it admits that we know they're coming for violence and that we're preparing in the info war to stand up and speak out, but that the Second Amendment is the ultimate backup so that we won't be transported into pure slavery like Venezuela.
[02:45:02.290 --> 02:45:12.217]  So Dana Loesch does a great job voicing this, and it just shows how the info war is radicalizing the entire conservative sphere, which we need to be radicalized to counter this radical threat.
[02:45:12.617 --> 02:45:15.639]  As Barry Goldwater said, extremism and the defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:16.820]  This isn't a call to violence.
[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:21.403]  It's a call that we know they're violent, saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:45:21.443 --> 02:45:21.864]  Here it is.
[02:45:23.305 --> 02:45:25.726]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:45:26.327 --> 02:45:30.049]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:45:30.549 --> 02:45:37.273]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:45:37.914 --> 02:45:41.056]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:45:41.776 --> 02:45:55.367]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[02:45:55.707 --> 02:46:01.372]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:46:01.912 --> 02:46:05.534]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:46:06.054 --> 02:46:16.499]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:46:17.339 --> 02:46:22.525]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:46:23.125 --> 02:46:25.067]  The clenched fist of freedom.
[02:46:25.308 --> 02:46:26.829]  The clenched fist of truth.
[02:46:27.109 --> 02:46:28.010]  That's the info war.
[02:46:28.151 --> 02:46:28.951]  That's the weapon.
[02:46:29.292 --> 02:46:32.875]  And you're an expert in the truth and taking action with info war.
[02:46:33.656 --> 02:46:39.803]  Paul, expanding on this, what would you say about what Dana Loesch was just saying?
[02:46:41.455 --> 02:46:50.524]  100% on Mark, and I wish we could find a way to broadcast that across America 24-7, 365, to awaken our own base.
[02:46:51.005 --> 02:46:53.828]  The problem with our side, Alex, is that we're too damn nice.
[02:46:54.448 --> 02:46:58.613]  We watch the other side roll over, a steamroll, time and time and time again.
[02:46:59.293 --> 02:47:04.098]  And look, we're dealing with a bully on the other side and we've got to stand up and we've got to fight.
[02:47:04.438 --> 02:47:09.783]  That piece right there by Dana is absolutely critical and on mark.
[02:47:09.803 --> 02:47:14.327]  You look at our first responders, our law enforcement, they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.
[02:47:14.588 --> 02:47:20.093]  To think the Democrat Party of today, the ultra-left liberal, is largely against law enforcement.
[02:47:20.293 --> 02:47:20.833]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:47:43.681 --> 02:47:50.470]  Civilization is unraveling right now, and I just wonder how far it can go down before people wake up, Paul.
[02:47:51.111 --> 02:47:58.261]  And, I mean, I see them fighting Trump so hard, trying to kill a recovery, trying to spew all this garbage, trying to hope we fail.
[02:47:59.783 --> 02:48:01.304]  It just seems like seppuku.
[02:48:01.344 --> 02:48:06.188]  It seems like the left wants to suicide the whole country because they're threatened by prosperity.
[02:48:06.228 --> 02:48:07.409]  They want Cloward and Piven.
[02:48:07.649 --> 02:48:10.451]  They admit they want to wreck it all so they can rebuild it.
[02:48:10.511 --> 02:48:14.835]  But when communists and socialists and collectivists wreck something, it never comes back.
[02:48:15.922 --> 02:48:16.623]  No, it won't.
[02:48:16.683 --> 02:48:24.113]  And remember, America is still a grand experiment and the best experiment on the face of this planet and one of the youngest democracies and consistently challenged.
[02:48:24.754 --> 02:48:30.622]  The major difference between how we look at the Constitution from Republicans to Democrats is the
[02:48:30.942 --> 02:48:40.586]  Democrats look at the Constitution as something that can evolve and change over time, where those of us on the other side, we look at this as the foundational document of who we are.
[02:48:41.007 --> 02:48:50.071]  And when we lose that of who we are, then we become this open society, Merkel view of European mentality, which is not American.
[02:48:50.531 --> 02:48:52.232]  If people want that, they should move to Europe.
[02:48:52.532 --> 02:48:58.755]  But Americans need to stand up here and stand on who we are and not allow the left any more destruction of our principles and values.
[02:49:00.282 --> 02:49:00.942]  All right, my friend.
[02:49:00.962 --> 02:49:06.666]  Well, I look forward to tracking and watching the success of the organization that you've launched, conservativemove.com.
[02:49:07.046 --> 02:49:24.636]  And I love the idea of us creating our own economies as libertarians, conservatives, constitutionalists, common sense, traditionalists, non-suicidalists, non-nihilists, of, hey, supporting broadcasts, supporting organizations, pooling our resources together, and not just giving our money and energy.
[02:49:24.656 --> 02:49:26.497]  I mean, I found with, say, liberal IT companies.
[02:49:27.438 --> 02:49:27.998]  Most of them are.
[02:49:28.299 --> 02:49:31.380]  They will, on purpose, not do a good job for you because you're conservative.
[02:49:32.121 --> 02:49:34.262]  Or a lot of big companies say, oh, you're Alex Jones.
[02:49:34.602 --> 02:49:37.224]  And of course, if I was a gay couple wanting a cake, I could sue them.
[02:49:37.704 --> 02:49:43.688]  And they violate the Civil Rights Act, you name it, and say, we're not going to let you work with our big credit card company because of what you do.
[02:49:43.708 --> 02:49:44.708]  They even tell us in emails.
[02:49:44.948 --> 02:49:46.469]  And my lawyers go, yeah, you have a total lawsuit.
[02:49:46.489 --> 02:49:46.789]  You win.
[02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.791]  What am I going to do?
[02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:50.572]  It's just they're trying to strangle us.
[02:49:50.912 --> 02:49:52.073]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:49:52.113 --> 02:49:53.394]  They're trying to destroy us.
[02:49:53.715 --> 02:50:00.760]  So more and more conservatives, libertarians, Christians need to really seek out people and build our own economy and break away from the parasites.
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:02.121]  Because they need us.
[02:50:02.201 --> 02:50:03.082]  We don't need them.
[02:50:03.562 --> 02:50:05.704]  And the parasites are finally figuring that out.
[02:50:05.964 --> 02:50:07.906]  So they're trying to bully us into submission.
[02:50:08.126 --> 02:50:11.909]  And just like the great meme war going on with CNN, it's only backfiring.
[02:50:11.949 --> 02:50:14.011]  I mean, everything they do is turning to crap.
[02:50:14.511 --> 02:50:17.394]  But it doesn't mean we can be complacent, because the war has just begun.
[02:50:17.414 --> 02:50:19.356]  I want to thank you so much, Paul, for joining us.
[02:50:20.076 --> 02:50:20.557]  Thank you, sir.
[02:50:20.577 --> 02:50:21.097]  Appreciate it.
[02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:22.258]  Very, very exciting.
[02:50:22.298 --> 02:50:24.420]  Paul Chabot, just now joining us.
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:24.961]  Great guy.
[02:50:25.421 --> 02:50:27.563]  Find out more on his website conservativemove.com.
[02:50:27.623 --> 02:50:30.566]  Okay, I got a little segment coming up, and then Owen Schroeder's coming in.
[02:50:30.586 --> 02:50:34.350]  I want to hit some other breaking news that is coming up.
[02:50:35.396 --> 02:50:37.658]  Millions of people hit the streets to say hi to Trump in Poland.
[02:50:37.978 --> 02:50:41.660]  They got a few thousand, 10,000 or so out to get a bunch of attention in Germany.
[02:50:42.341 --> 02:50:43.642]  All Soros funded, literally.
[02:50:43.662 --> 02:50:46.143]  A bunch of jihadis running around saying they want to get Trump.
[02:50:46.644 --> 02:50:48.825]  Yeah, how dare that evil guy want to have free market?
[02:50:49.446 --> 02:50:50.506]  We like Kim Jong-un.
[02:50:50.546 --> 02:50:51.167]  He's much better.
[02:50:52.148 --> 02:50:53.949]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the InfoWars.
[02:50:54.049 --> 02:50:56.050]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:50:56.430 --> 02:51:00.013]  When you spread that link, it is an act of resistance, so please keep hammering it.
[02:51:00.373 --> 02:51:02.635]  And call C-SPAN and other talk shows and plug InfoWars.
[02:51:03.635 --> 02:51:08.779]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:17.206]  It's easy to light and you can cook with wood, charcoal, or any biomass fuel in a rugged and durable design.
[02:51:17.407 --> 02:51:20.389]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[02:51:20.589 --> 02:51:26.534]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[02:51:26.654 --> 02:51:30.858]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[02:51:31.258 --> 02:51:36.925]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[02:51:37.345 --> 02:51:42.631]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal, you got yourself an entire meal.
[02:51:42.651 --> 02:51:44.994]  Now that looks good.
[02:51:46.135 --> 02:51:58.284]  Visit Infowarsstore.com for more details and see how you can become the master outdoor chef and enjoy cooking freedom with the EcoZoom Versa Outdoor Stove.
[02:51:58.624 --> 02:52:03.227]  Available right now at, you guessed it, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:03.727 --> 02:52:15.396]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:52:15.976 --> 02:52:18.057]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:52:18.237 --> 02:52:21.079]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:52:21.499 --> 02:52:22.820]  It's made in the USA.
[02:52:23.461 --> 02:52:31.826]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:52:32.186 --> 02:52:34.147]  It is a classical 360Win.
[02:52:34.628 --> 02:52:38.450]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:44.354]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality
[02:52:45.114 --> 02:52:47.575]  Of purity and of strength.
[02:52:48.516 --> 02:52:51.897]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[02:52:52.317 --> 02:52:59.901]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years since we launched in 4 Wars Life to actually come up with this.
[02:53:00.681 --> 02:53:08.265]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection.
[02:53:08.925 --> 02:53:09.425]  When it comes
[02:53:28.596 --> 02:53:38.424]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[02:53:38.484 --> 02:53:46.751]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:53:46.951 --> 02:53:53.677]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[02:53:54.691 --> 02:53:58.473]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:53:58.933 --> 02:54:00.254]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[02:54:00.894 --> 02:54:02.935]  With Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:54:24.759 --> 02:54:26.460]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[02:54:27.881 --> 02:54:29.362]  There's too much confusion.
[02:54:29.402 --> 02:54:33.744]  I can't get no relief.
[02:54:33.764 --> 02:54:36.026]  Alright, I've got some final stories I want to hit.
[02:54:36.086 --> 02:54:37.387]  And Owen Schroer is coming in.
[02:54:37.427 --> 02:54:41.149]  He is locked and loaded and wound up with a bunch of clips and news and ready to go.
[02:54:42.049 --> 02:54:51.135]  The meme war has turned CNN from a dead organization to just an absolutely destroyed crater in the ground.
[02:54:52.295 --> 02:54:53.076]  Less than zero.
[02:54:54.508 --> 02:54:55.949]  And I am so excited about that.
[02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:58.332]  A lot of amazing memes at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:54:58.612 --> 02:54:59.513]  Be sure to follow us there.
[02:54:59.533 --> 02:55:03.237]  A lot of amazing memes right now on Infowars.com as we update these pages.
[02:55:04.778 --> 02:55:06.259]  I'm looking all over the news.
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:11.204]  Everywhere is robots at factories and pizza places and jobs being taken.
[02:55:11.224 --> 02:55:12.505]  Look at Drudge right there also.
[02:55:13.887 --> 02:55:16.870]  Infowars.com, it is just a crazy time to be alive.
[02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:17.891]  Briefly,
[02:55:19.810 --> 02:55:20.911]  It doesn't just fund the operation.
[02:55:21.031 --> 02:55:25.315]  You really need to have DNA Force, our best-selling overall product, when it's in stock.
[02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:28.858]  Very hard to get the BioPQQ that's truly organic and other things that are in it.
[02:55:29.438 --> 02:55:34.362]  Infowarsstore.com, it's now back in stock after almost six months being out.
[02:55:34.763 --> 02:55:36.164]  20% off, DNA Force is back.
[02:55:36.644 --> 02:55:39.307]  Get the MycoZX, it goes great with the Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:55:40.236 --> 02:55:44.521]  For 30% off, that's now back in stock, but DNA Force is back.
[02:55:45.262 --> 02:55:49.187]  It is simply incredible, and it's, again, 20% off.
[02:55:50.468 --> 02:55:56.756]  There's nothing else like it, except at medical clinics and stuff, and they totally gouge you and charge you three times, basically, for the same thing.
[02:55:57.657 --> 02:56:03.200]  This is really the highest quality of CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all these other things that synergistically work together.
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:04.601]  Hundreds of studies.
[02:56:04.641 --> 02:56:10.484]  You can even make claims on this because of the nerve growth factor and all the rest of it.
[02:56:10.564 --> 02:56:13.025]  Energize, detoxify the mitochondria.
[02:56:14.386 --> 02:56:15.627]  It's next level.
[02:56:15.667 --> 02:56:16.667]  DNAForce.
[02:56:17.088 --> 02:56:18.428]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:56:18.969 --> 02:56:23.831]  It's our most expensive product, but it is massively discounted and you really owe it to yourself and your family.
[02:56:24.592 --> 02:56:26.493]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:27.313 --> 02:56:28.454]  All of this supports the broadcast, so thank you.
[02:56:28.474 --> 02:56:29.974]  Let me just play this one more time.
[02:56:29.994 --> 02:56:32.736]  I'm going to go to break and come back and hit some other breaking news.
[02:56:57.734 --> 02:57:03.818]  Vatican police break up drug-fueled gay orgy at home of Secretary of the Pope Francis' key advisors.
[02:57:04.439 --> 02:57:08.322]  We broke this on Monday, and then by Wednesday it broke in the international news.
[02:57:08.782 --> 02:57:10.103]  AP Reuters Daily Mail.
[02:57:10.703 --> 02:57:15.067]  But notice it then goes out of the news the next day, like the deputy pope caught running child kidnapping rings.
[02:57:15.647 --> 02:57:16.387]  Child rape rings.
[02:57:17.428 --> 02:57:18.509]  So how's the media counter it?
[02:57:18.529 --> 02:57:20.570]  They just make it up that I said there's Mars bases.
[02:57:20.611 --> 02:57:23.893]  Never said it, they just lie and tell everybody that.
[02:57:25.498 --> 02:57:26.982]  Because they want to cover up.
[02:57:27.002 --> 02:57:29.228]  I mean, I'm sorry, they want to cover up the real stuff.
[02:57:29.248 --> 02:57:32.316]  So, here's the investigative journalist who lives in Rome who broke it on Monday.
[02:57:33.578 --> 02:57:52.783]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[02:57:53.003 --> 02:57:55.584]  The police broke in and found a gay orgy
[02:57:56.964 --> 02:58:07.572]  And they were using cocaine, and they basically had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal, who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[02:58:07.952 --> 02:58:19.320]  So there is also an internal war here, and of course, nobody wanted to show the face of this priest, but I wanted to show it to your viewers.
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:22.082]  He's called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi.
[02:58:22.942 --> 02:58:29.286]  And only very few media, I think only RT probably just mentioned the name of Capozzi's boss.
[02:58:53.450 --> 02:58:54.831]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:56.372]  You can't survive without it.
[02:58:56.592 --> 02:58:57.492]  But where do you get it?
[02:58:57.792 --> 02:59:03.556]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:03.776 --> 02:59:09.499]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:09.679 --> 02:59:26.563]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:59:29.444 --> 02:59:30.624]  Stainless steel construction.

[02:59:55.638 --> 02:59:59.728]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:00.270 --> 03:00:01.553]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:15.206 --> 03:00:18.947]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:20.048 --> 03:00:21.488]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:21.708 --> 03:00:22.849]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:30.411]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.491 --> 03:00:35.933]  We've got Owen Schroer coming in in the next segment to cover a bunch of news.
[03:00:35.973 --> 03:00:37.294]  Take your phone calls, you name it.
[03:00:38.074 --> 03:00:39.434]  Had a bunch of big guests tomorrow.
[03:00:39.454 --> 03:00:40.335]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[03:00:40.355 --> 03:00:40.875]  11 a.m.
[03:00:40.895 --> 03:00:41.435]  to 3 p.m.
[03:00:41.495 --> 03:00:41.895]  Central.
[03:00:42.235 --> 03:00:43.536]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:00:44.724 --> 03:00:49.626]  You know, I was on DrudgeReport.com, I was on Infowars.com just now looking at the different headlines that are breaking in.
[03:00:50.652 --> 03:01:02.637]  Everywhere Trump goes, they're chanting USA, USA, and they get so incredibly angry and so incredibly upset because the media wants to create the illusion that everyone hates Trump all over the world.
[03:01:02.657 --> 03:01:04.078]  But the Indian president loves him.
[03:01:04.478 --> 03:01:05.378]  Folks love him in India.
[03:01:05.398 --> 03:01:07.159]  That's a billion, one hundred million people.
[03:01:07.199 --> 03:01:08.019]  He's super popular.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:10.781]  Folks in non-radical Muslim countries love him.
[03:01:11.601 --> 03:01:14.422]  People all over love Trump because they want prosperity.
[03:01:14.442 --> 03:01:15.563]  They know America's better.
[03:01:16.431 --> 03:01:17.132]  Then North Korea.
[03:01:32.301 --> 03:01:35.764]  And threats to Trump mean maker, New Day host doubles down.
[03:01:36.264 --> 03:01:38.986]  Thinks he's so tough, because his brother's a governor.
[03:01:39.346 --> 03:01:45.591]  How shameful that he has his job, as his own producer said, because his brother is the mob boss of New York.
[03:01:45.951 --> 03:01:49.374]  CNN host Chris Cuomo was confronted today over why he deleted a tweet.
[03:01:49.774 --> 03:01:50.194]  We're good to go.
[03:02:14.569 --> 03:02:18.010]  Extortion of Reddit user who posted a meme about CNN.
[03:02:18.210 --> 03:02:20.171]  Look at that billionaire strut he's got.
[03:02:20.191 --> 03:02:20.871]  What a thug.
[03:02:21.011 --> 03:02:22.791]  These people are all mentally ill.
[03:02:22.811 --> 03:02:23.571]  They're so cool.
[03:02:23.751 --> 03:02:24.972]  You're uncool, Cuomo.
[03:02:24.992 --> 03:02:26.392]  You're a thug and a piece of crap.
[03:02:26.412 --> 03:02:28.013]  You and your filthy brother.
[03:02:28.513 --> 03:02:30.593]  There was no encouraging any extortion.
[03:02:30.633 --> 03:02:32.034]  He wasn't a teenager.
[03:02:32.054 --> 03:02:34.754]  The reason I took the tweet down was because the decision had already been made.
[03:02:35.094 --> 03:02:38.855]  I thought it was more conditional about whether or not his name was going to be released.
[03:02:38.995 --> 03:02:40.556]  Oh, so you admit you're a thug.
[03:02:42.406 --> 03:02:50.748]  Reveals how CNN hosts thought it was responsible for the network to essentially be threatening the individual, with the revelation that the interview didn't stop anti-CNN memes.
[03:02:50.768 --> 03:02:56.829]  You know, they're just so used to... A lot of the folks that have come into New York the last 100 years are from really authoritarian regimes.
[03:02:58.189 --> 03:03:03.730]  There was more history of rebellion in Europe against tyranny, not that it was perfect, but a lot of folks are used to bowing down to thugs.
[03:03:04.251 --> 03:03:05.531]  And they just bow down to Cuomo.
[03:03:06.371 --> 03:03:08.251]  So the video's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:03:08.671 --> 03:03:10.512]  I'm gonna get Owen Schwerer when he comes in to...
[03:03:11.328 --> 03:03:11.968]  Play that video.
[03:03:12.048 --> 03:03:15.609]  We've got some other videos we haven't gotten to, but it's powerful.
[03:03:15.629 --> 03:03:19.710]  Should see or know the name of the Reddit user who made Trump wrestling video?
[03:03:20.010 --> 03:03:22.770]  Had a lot of bigoted and hateful material on the page, said Cuomo.
[03:03:24.111 --> 03:03:25.131]  Probably totally made up.
[03:03:25.211 --> 03:03:26.251]  Probably not even a real person.
[03:03:26.291 --> 03:03:28.472]  We have the ultimate Trump meme compilation.
[03:03:28.492 --> 03:03:31.712]  That's a new compilation of a lot of the videos and some of the new ones.
[03:03:31.932 --> 03:03:32.913]  Very, very powerful.
[03:03:34.313 --> 03:03:37.213]  And it gets into our $20,000 contest.
[03:03:37.854 --> 03:03:39.734]  We also have that Watson is running.
[03:03:41.010 --> 03:03:41.290]  I think?
[03:03:56.653 --> 03:03:59.114]  How she got her job and why is she working for Soros.
[03:03:59.154 --> 03:04:01.495]  Very important article by Roger Stone.
[03:04:02.115 --> 03:04:03.915]  All this needs to get out.
[03:04:04.676 --> 03:04:10.757]  Germany bans soldiers from wearing uniforms at G20 summit for their own protection from the loving jihadis.
[03:04:11.718 --> 03:04:14.799]  Trump donates presidential salary to restoring civil war battlefield.
[03:04:16.399 --> 03:04:19.620]  CNN comments he says they have some very serious problems.
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:22.241]  In fact, we'll play his clip on that.
[03:04:22.281 --> 03:04:25.042]  We haven't gotten to that either on the other side of this break.
[03:04:26.288 --> 03:04:27.789]  The crew is doing a great job.
[03:04:27.889 --> 03:04:30.430]  Nightly News again as I said tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:04:30.450 --> 03:04:32.912]  A lot of big things coming here to InfoWars.
[03:04:33.232 --> 03:04:36.474]  But we've got to do it because look at Macron who announced himself to be God Emperor.
[03:04:36.934 --> 03:04:42.377]  He says all children will take 11 new vaccines and that anyone that gets in his way, he's declared martial law.
[03:04:42.858 --> 03:04:46.920]  Very, very liberal.
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:53.564]  Even Politico is reporting that he is the Jupiterian Lordship because I guess he was a
[03:04:55.629 --> 03:04:59.456]  Child, you know, diblet that the globalists enjoy.
[03:04:59.476 --> 03:05:02.080]  So now he's their, he's their, he's their, he's their god.
[03:05:08.911 --> 03:05:11.092]  Joining us now is Mark Dice.
[03:05:11.172 --> 03:05:13.012]  I'm sure you know all about him by now.
[03:05:13.072 --> 03:05:15.933]  Just reached over a million subscribers on YouTube.
[03:05:16.273 --> 03:05:17.474]  New videos every day.
[03:05:17.494 --> 03:05:18.594]  He's also an author.
[03:05:18.694 --> 03:05:21.895]  His latest book is The Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[03:05:22.255 --> 03:05:25.796]  I don't know how much longer they can cling on to this conspiracy theory about Russia.
[03:05:25.816 --> 03:05:27.697]  I mean, they might drag it on another few months.
[03:05:27.877 --> 03:05:30.538]  It's been seven months now since the election.
[03:05:32.093 --> 03:05:35.034]  You don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something.
[03:05:35.134 --> 03:05:36.075]  Is that a fair statement?
[03:05:36.095 --> 03:05:36.895]  I don't as I sit here.
[03:05:36.915 --> 03:05:37.135]  Thank you.
[03:05:37.155 --> 03:05:37.796]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[03:05:54.843 --> 03:05:57.345]  You can hope horrible things onto someone.
[03:05:57.365 --> 03:05:59.387]  That's not a threat, that's not a direction.
[03:06:00.008 --> 03:06:02.830]  I took it as a direction.
[03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:08.675]  As the President of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[03:06:09.315 --> 03:06:10.996]  I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.
[03:06:11.197 --> 03:06:13.458]  You may have taken it as a direction, but that's not what he said.
[03:06:13.498 --> 03:06:13.999]  Correct.
[03:06:14.279 --> 03:06:14.799]  It's just insane.
[03:06:14.820 --> 03:06:20.124]  Even Chris Matthews has admitted that the whole Russia collusion conspiracy theory has come apart.
[03:06:20.584 --> 03:06:29.227]  The assumption of the critics of the president, of his pursuers you might say, is that somewhere along the line in the last year the president had something to do with colluding with the Russians.
[03:06:29.287 --> 03:06:34.828]  Something to do with helping hand, encouraging them, feeding their desire to affect the election in some way.
[03:06:35.149 --> 03:06:40.130]  Some role they played, some conversation he had with Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort or somewhere.
[03:06:40.530 --> 03:06:42.971]  And yet what came apart this morning was that theory.
[03:06:43.331 --> 03:07:01.205]  Let's not forget, during some of his previous testimony and another time, several months ago, he said that people will occasionally in the Justice Department say that, quote, we don't think there's a crime here, or, you know, they'll give, quote, their opinions to us, but never a directive to actually close a case.
[03:07:01.285 --> 03:07:03.066]  And some of his language was so bizarre.
[03:07:03.426 --> 03:07:04.607]  Captain Courageous.
[03:07:05.048 --> 03:07:05.488]  Yeah.
[03:07:06.148 --> 03:07:06.889]  Oh Lordy.
[03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:09.211]  I mean, golly gee, Mr. Comey.
[03:07:09.791 --> 03:07:11.293]  I just don't see a case here.
[03:07:11.553 --> 03:07:15.177]  The guy needs to go away, crawl back into the hole that he came out of.
[03:07:15.477 --> 03:07:19.522]  His bag's under his eyes so big, I could put my groceries in them.
[03:07:19.542 --> 03:07:29.512]  And if we're gonna go off of the intent being one of the primary reasons for indicting someone, President Trump did not intend that hoping was a direct order.
[03:07:30.633 --> 03:07:33.734]  Spelling it out in his words, I mean, what was he doing?
[03:07:33.814 --> 03:07:36.014]  Sending him, you know, signals via ESP?
[03:07:36.034 --> 03:07:40.835]  Or, you know, spelling it out in, you know, in barbecue sauce on his plate?
[03:07:40.915 --> 03:07:42.116]  Or in carrot sticks?
[03:07:42.176 --> 03:07:43.556]  I mean... But it's so ridiculous!
[03:07:43.616 --> 03:07:53.498]  It's like, if you're the President of the United States, and you see this waste of time, waste of money, waste of resources, waste of energy, waste of everything, of course you want it stopped!
[03:07:53.719 --> 03:07:57.439]  But he's smart enough to know that Comey is a snake, so he was like, well, I hope you end this.
[03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:58.020]  He didn't.
[03:07:58.140 --> 03:07:59.780]  He said, okay, you fire it.
[03:08:08.712 --> 03:08:12.633]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:08:13.073 --> 03:08:16.994]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:17.694 --> 03:08:20.755]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:08:22.395 --> 03:08:25.616]  Well, CNN has completely failed.
[03:08:26.996 --> 03:08:29.256]  And it's not even a news organization anymore.
[03:08:29.856 --> 03:08:31.657]  CNN is now a meme.
[03:08:33.081 --> 03:08:42.968]  So when you hear CNN or you see the CNN logo, it used to be at one time associated with news, then it was associated with fake news.
[03:08:43.609 --> 03:08:45.090]  Now it's just a meme.
[03:08:45.490 --> 03:08:47.872]  Now CNN is a complete meme.
[03:08:48.913 --> 03:08:57.279]  And it all, you know, I don't know if it all started with the retweeted meme of Donald Trump beating up the CNN logo at a WrestleMania match.
[03:08:58.638 --> 03:09:06.122]  It was, I mean, InfoWars was putting out memes, Trump memes, with the CNN head on it months before Trump retweeted that meme.
[03:09:06.162 --> 03:09:15.387]  But that was the meme that really kicked off the great meme war and has transformed CNN from a news organization into now a meme.
[03:09:15.747 --> 03:09:17.208]  Just a complete meme.
[03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:19.489]  As Alex is still cleaning up.
[03:09:19.529 --> 03:09:20.530]  Hey, look at this shirt, Alex.
[03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:21.651]  How does it feel?
[03:09:21.711 --> 03:09:23.972]  I'm just getting my phones and just getting my gun, sorry.
[03:09:25.114 --> 03:09:27.216]  CNN is fake news.
[03:09:27.256 --> 03:09:29.378]  This is the t-shirt at InfoWars.com.
[03:09:29.438 --> 03:09:31.881]  Once again ahead of the curve as usual.
[03:09:32.381 --> 03:09:33.823]  We knew that CNN was fake news.
[03:09:33.843 --> 03:09:40.870]  We were telling that for years and now the president has forced it to go mainstream and we've actually got a new video.
[03:09:41.070 --> 03:09:42.491]  CNN can't win anymore folks.
[03:09:42.551 --> 03:09:44.674]  I was actually amazed when I saw this video because
[03:09:45.988 --> 03:09:49.430]  Chris Cuomo has a security detail.
[03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:57.135]  He gets into some Cadillac Escalade blacked out windows and we're about to have this new video that just went up on the internet today.
[03:09:57.155 --> 03:10:00.998]  Infowars.com you can see the story from Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:10:01.138 --> 03:10:05.541]  Arrogant Chris Cuomo confronted about CNN threats to Trump meme maker.
[03:10:06.702 --> 03:10:09.824]  So let me know when we have that video ready to go guys.
[03:10:10.424 --> 03:10:12.686]  So Chris Cuomo comes out of the CNN studio.
[03:10:14.145 --> 03:10:18.806]  Laura Loomer confronts him saying, hey, how do you feel being a total bully saying Trump's a bully?
[03:10:19.207 --> 03:10:20.127]  Being a total hypocrite.
[03:10:20.147 --> 03:10:22.367]  And he said, well, you know, that's not what happened.
[03:10:22.427 --> 03:10:23.168]  I'm not a bully.
[03:10:23.188 --> 03:10:24.588]  You know, I wasn't a 15-year-old kid.
[03:10:24.628 --> 03:10:25.508]  This, that, the other thing.
[03:10:25.988 --> 03:10:29.369]  And then had to address the tweet he deleted.
[03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:34.511]  So nonetheless, if you work at CNN now,
[03:10:35.882 --> 03:10:38.723]  I guess they've always had the security detail that waits outside.
[03:10:39.124 --> 03:10:44.526]  But I would imagine they are worried about violence is why they have that security detail.
[03:10:44.566 --> 03:10:48.168]  Well, there's no violence being done against the CNN host.
[03:10:48.488 --> 03:10:50.169]  There is violence being done against Republicans.
[03:10:50.189 --> 03:10:51.190]  We'll get to that in a second.
[03:10:51.210 --> 03:10:53.391]  We've actually got new news on that, if you can believe that or not.
[03:10:53.991 --> 03:11:04.383]  But so now CNN is getting confronted by citizen journalists on the street, outside of their studios, and they're being forced to answer questions.
[03:11:04.704 --> 03:11:08.668]  And it's only continuing to make them look worse because they have to defend themselves.
[03:11:09.625 --> 03:11:27.733]  So now all of these CNN anchors who go on air in the offensive position, who go on air on the offensive against Trump, who arrogantly go on air even though nobody takes them seriously anymore, they then have to go out into the real elements of the real world and be confronted with the real people who know who they really are.
[03:11:28.994 --> 03:11:31.535]  And they look like complete jackasses.
[03:11:31.635 --> 03:11:34.336]  Here is Chris Cuomo being addressed on the streets.
[03:11:37.808 --> 03:11:45.033]  On July 4th, CNN and Chris Cuomo were accused of extorting a Reddit user who allegedly created the Trump vs CNN wrestling gif.
[03:11:46.114 --> 03:11:50.697]  Chris Cuomo tweeted, Should CNN reveal the name of the Reddit user who made the Trump wrestling video?
[03:11:51.037 --> 03:11:53.099]  A lot of bigoted and hateful tweets coming at me.
[03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:56.771]  And then Cuomo had to delete that tweet.
[03:11:57.692 --> 03:11:59.754]  Then Laura Loomer caught Cuomo on the streets.
[03:11:59.774 --> 03:12:01.134]  I have a quick question for you.
[03:12:01.174 --> 03:12:06.798]  Why did you delete a tweet in which you were encouraging the extortion of a Reddit user who posted a meme about CNN?
[03:12:08.419 --> 03:12:10.942]  There was no encouraging any extortion.
[03:12:11.042 --> 03:12:12.423]  He wasn't a teenager.
[03:12:12.823 --> 03:12:15.966]  And the reason I took the tweet down was because the decision had already been made.
[03:12:16.427 --> 03:12:20.511]  I thought it was more conditional about whether or not his name was going to be released, and it wasn't.
[03:12:20.831 --> 03:12:28.979]  His name was already, you know, going to be kept by the cause of his own actions and their concerns about his privacy.
[03:12:28.999 --> 03:12:30.100]  So, does that make any sense?
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:30.901]  So, take it down.
[03:12:30.921 --> 03:12:32.002]  It's not the first time I've deleted a tweet.
[03:12:32.042 --> 03:12:37.704]  Do you think that it's appropriate for CNN to be targeting private citizens over memes that CNN doesn't like?
[03:12:37.724 --> 03:12:39.084]  I don't think that's what happened.
[03:12:39.124 --> 03:12:42.725]  And I think you should look at the other content on that site and think about who you're defending.
[03:12:42.805 --> 03:12:43.285]  What site?
[03:12:43.305 --> 03:12:44.806]  He doesn't even mention the site.
[03:12:46.186 --> 03:12:47.567]  But you guys accused Trump of bullying.
[03:12:48.927 --> 03:12:49.667]  And there's the key.
[03:12:50.808 --> 03:12:51.708]  There's the key.
[03:12:52.108 --> 03:12:54.349]  And then the CNN security approached Laura.
[03:12:55.959 --> 03:12:57.279]  Telling her she couldn't film on the streets.
[03:12:57.679 --> 03:12:58.380]  I love this!
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:04.621]  This is one of the best... I'm telling you.
[03:13:05.221 --> 03:13:07.481]  These people are so out of touch with reality.
[03:13:07.561 --> 03:13:09.122]  This is honestly their reality.
[03:13:09.462 --> 03:13:09.702]  Okay.
[03:13:10.582 --> 03:13:11.822]  I've had to deal with this before.
[03:13:12.502 --> 03:13:14.523]  I dealt with this when I spoke to Van Jones.
[03:13:14.923 --> 03:13:17.403]  I dealt with this when I confronted Don Lemon on the street.
[03:13:17.763 --> 03:13:20.764]  I dealt with this when I confronted Jake Tapper on the street.
[03:13:21.504 --> 03:13:23.125]  There is this... I don't know what it is.
[03:13:23.165 --> 03:13:25.025]  It's an arrogance, but it's beyond an arrogance.
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:30.142]  They really think that they can tell you not to film them.
[03:13:31.243 --> 03:13:33.464]  They really think they are above you.
[03:13:33.964 --> 03:13:36.266]  They really think they are above reproach.
[03:13:37.187 --> 03:13:38.808]  Now, I'll give credit to Chris Cuomo.
[03:13:38.848 --> 03:13:40.909]  I'll give credit to Van Jones.
[03:13:41.089 --> 03:13:43.771]  When I stopped Van Jones and talked to him, he gave me 30 minutes.
[03:13:44.691 --> 03:13:47.013]  Chris Cuomo gave Laura Loomer a minute to talk there.
[03:13:47.353 --> 03:13:47.973]  I'll give him a credit.
[03:13:48.013 --> 03:13:53.717]  Now, Don Lemonade and Fake Fapper, they didn't want to have any time of day with me.
[03:13:53.757 --> 03:13:54.357]  I can't blame them.
[03:13:54.377 --> 03:13:55.218]  They're complete nothings.
[03:13:56.186 --> 03:14:00.009]  But they always have a little handler or a little security detail that's there.
[03:14:00.770 --> 03:14:07.055]  If you dare film them, oh, did you just dare film Chris Cuomo, the almighty?
[03:14:07.595 --> 03:14:10.277]  Did you just dare film the almighty Chris Cuomo?
[03:14:10.778 --> 03:14:14.521]  And so then the CNN security detail runs over there and scampers over there.
[03:14:14.941 --> 03:14:16.762]  Whoa, whoa, do you have any footage of Chris Cuomo?
[03:14:17.103 --> 03:14:17.903]  You're not allowed to have that.
[03:14:17.943 --> 03:14:18.824]  You can't have that footage.
[03:14:19.284 --> 03:14:22.026]  You're literally on the streets of New York, dude, okay?
[03:14:22.387 --> 03:14:23.348]  This is America.
[03:14:24.048 --> 03:14:29.613]  You have the right to film someone in public, absolutely, and then Cuomo even volunteered a minute of his time.
[03:14:29.913 --> 03:14:36.498]  But there's always, there's little minions, little security minions telling you, you can't film, you can't take pictures, that's illegal.
[03:14:37.019 --> 03:14:37.219]  No!
[03:14:37.239 --> 03:14:38.540]  Let me tell you something.
[03:14:39.286 --> 03:14:48.208]  If you're out there and you happen to run into a CNN talking head or an MSNBC talking head or whoever, and you want to film them or take a picture, you have every right to do that.
[03:14:48.568 --> 03:15:00.990]  And the minute someone tries to intimidate you from CNN or from one of these networks to say, you can't take that picture, you can't record that interview, you can't talk to this person, stand up for yourself, that is complete bull.
[03:15:01.591 --> 03:15:03.231]  You have every right to film in public.
[03:15:04.091 --> 03:15:07.656]  And only the most arrogant people in the world would think that they're above reproach.
[03:15:07.977 --> 03:15:09.979]  And those are the people at CNN.
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:11.742]  Now Ted Cruz has come out.
[03:15:12.603 --> 03:15:13.144]  Now remember...
[03:15:15.575 --> 03:15:22.136]  Chris Cuomo just, not only did he probably admit it in the tweet, he just admitted it on film.
[03:15:23.016 --> 03:15:34.739]  CNN did whatever research they had to do, whatever investigation they had to do to find out, or they're saying they did, who really knows I guess, they are the fake news network.
[03:15:35.539 --> 03:15:41.900]  They know who made the meme, they found out who it was, and they got his personal information, and then they got in touch with him.
[03:15:43.058 --> 03:15:51.342]  And essentially intimidated him, or hashtag CNN blackmail, blackmailed him into making a public apology.
[03:15:51.782 --> 03:16:01.427]  They then ran with the public apology on air to puff up their own chest, pretend they had a victory, pretend we were successful, we got the mad guy to apologize.
[03:16:02.688 --> 03:16:04.209]  We had the final laugh, we're CNN.
[03:16:05.509 --> 03:16:08.271]  And then, of course, they become a meme overnight.
[03:16:08.791 --> 03:16:09.411]  But look at this.
[03:16:09.731 --> 03:16:14.794]  They admitted, so they did all the research, they got his private information, they had the conversation with him.
[03:16:15.035 --> 03:16:18.557]  Chris Cuomo says, well, we know it's not a 15-year-old boy, so I guess they know who it is.
[03:16:18.577 --> 03:16:19.637]  Of course they did.
[03:16:19.657 --> 03:16:20.598]  They tried to intimidate him.
[03:16:20.618 --> 03:16:21.899]  They forced him to apologize.
[03:16:22.699 --> 03:16:31.547]  But they are admitting, they are admitting that they were going to release his private information if he didn't apologize.
[03:16:31.768 --> 03:16:34.330]  That's essentially what CNN has admitted.
[03:16:34.650 --> 03:16:40.075]  So now Ted Cruz comes out today, or excuse me, he actually said...
[03:16:41.519 --> 03:16:42.840]  I guess he said this yesterday.
[03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:45.622]  CNN may have broken the law.
[03:16:46.203 --> 03:16:55.249]  According to Senator Cruz, CNN threats to dox the Reddit user who created the Trump wrestling CNN video could be a violation of Georgia law.
[03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:57.451]  So how do you like that?
[03:16:57.931 --> 03:17:00.273]  CNN, of course, is headquartered in Atlanta.
[03:17:00.994 --> 03:17:04.857]  And Ted Cruz say, well, CNN, you may have actually broken the law.
[03:17:07.098 --> 03:17:09.220]  I'm telling you, it's incredible.
[03:17:10.612 --> 03:17:23.041]  To see CNN not just getting beaten to a bloody pulp politically by President Trump and by We The People and by the Infowarriors out there, but they're also doing it to themselves!
[03:17:25.142 --> 03:17:35.790]  They're not only absorbing all of the blows from free citizens, from President Trump, from real media, they're also shooting themselves in the foot left and right.
[03:17:36.511 --> 03:17:38.052]  And they don't get it.
[03:17:39.229 --> 03:17:40.990]  They really don't get it.
[03:17:42.310 --> 03:17:44.831]  So CNN is already dead as a news organization.
[03:17:44.891 --> 03:17:46.172]  CNN is now a meme.
[03:17:47.072 --> 03:17:49.433]  The question is, what is the future of CNN?
[03:17:50.313 --> 03:17:56.716]  Are they going to continue to do their broadcasts and go on air and pretend that people care what they think?
[03:17:56.796 --> 03:17:58.376]  Pretend they're real news?
[03:17:58.957 --> 03:18:02.458]  Pretend that anybody takes them seriously?
[03:18:02.618 --> 03:18:03.518]  Anybody trusts them?
[03:18:05.639 --> 03:18:07.440]  You know, it's been rumored that
[03:18:08.820 --> 03:18:16.243]  President Trump's FDA is considering banning big pharmaceutical ads from television.
[03:18:17.384 --> 03:18:21.206]  And there was a list put out of the CNN advertisers.
[03:18:21.706 --> 03:18:23.367]  These are the advertisers to boycott.
[03:18:24.007 --> 03:18:28.469]  But it didn't include the big pharma advertisers that go on there regularly.
[03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:40.151]  And I'm just thinking, if the FDA made it illegal for big pharmaceutical companies to peddle their pharmaceutical drugs, you know the ads I'm talking about.
[03:18:41.072 --> 03:18:48.861]  Side effects include blindness, death, paralyzation, cancer, nervousness, brain explosion, lung collapse, foot, leg falls off.
[03:18:49.767 --> 03:18:56.531]  If the FDA bans those ads from television, how much longer can a CNN really last?
[03:18:57.271 --> 03:19:06.536]  I think CNN is the only one that I think that would be a death blow to because I think people are so sick of CNN, even advertisers at this point are going to start dropping off when their next round of contracts come up.
[03:19:07.416 --> 03:19:14.200]  MSNBC at least has some ratings that they can at least provide to advertisers, but I don't think CNN is going to be there much longer.
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:16.480]  Did CNN break the law?
[03:19:16.820 --> 03:19:18.481]  What is the future for CNN?
[03:19:18.701 --> 03:19:20.941]  Are they going to continue to shoot themselves in the foot?
[03:19:21.381 --> 03:19:22.721]  Are the memes ever going to stop?
[03:19:22.761 --> 03:19:24.842]  I mean, my gosh, the memes don't stop!
[03:19:24.962 --> 03:19:25.802]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:19:26.282 --> 03:19:31.523]  I thought I saw all the memes in the world yesterday, hundreds of these things, and then there's hundreds of new ones today.
[03:19:31.883 --> 03:19:34.083]  So CNN is now officially a meme.
[03:19:35.243 --> 03:19:39.044]  Of course, InfoWars.com is having the competition.
[03:19:39.124 --> 03:19:40.864]  Who can make the best CNN meme?
[03:19:41.064 --> 03:19:43.665]  I don't know how Paul Joseph Watson is going to judge this.
[03:19:45.182 --> 03:19:47.385]  There's CNN putting themselves in a trash can.
[03:19:47.745 --> 03:19:50.349]  There's Trump Hulk smashing CNN into the ground.
[03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:52.312]  CNN is beyond fake news.
[03:19:52.712 --> 03:19:53.814]  CNN is ISIS.
[03:19:54.174 --> 03:19:55.576]  CNN is now a meme.
[03:19:56.197 --> 03:20:01.304]  And it is because we the people have decided that it's time for CNN to be looked at as the joke that it is.
[03:20:13.991 --> 03:20:26.079]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[03:20:27.420 --> 03:20:42.930]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[03:20:43.891 --> 03:20:57.482]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[03:20:58.543 --> 03:21:05.509]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[03:21:06.397 --> 03:21:09.259]  That our species has never even imagined.
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:17.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[03:21:19.266 --> 03:21:27.512]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[03:21:28.312 --> 03:21:32.576]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[03:21:33.676 --> 03:21:35.658]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[03:21:36.687 --> 03:21:50.838]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people and the people of the world.
[03:21:51.379 --> 03:22:01.327]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[03:22:02.308 --> 03:22:05.130]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[03:22:06.929 --> 03:22:09.090]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[03:22:10.091 --> 03:22:14.333]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[03:22:14.693 --> 03:22:15.614]  It's why they hate me.
[03:22:15.874 --> 03:22:16.754]  It's why they hate you.
[03:22:17.034 --> 03:22:19.816]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[03:22:20.036 --> 03:22:25.899]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[03:22:26.459 --> 03:22:31.662]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead,
[03:22:32.597 --> 03:22:36.782]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[03:22:36.802 --> 03:22:40.165]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[03:22:40.586 --> 03:22:46.652]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[03:22:47.153 --> 03:22:54.260]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[03:22:55.117 --> 03:22:56.898]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[03:22:56.958 --> 03:23:03.162]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbridge Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[03:23:03.842 --> 03:23:09.506]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[03:23:10.346 --> 03:23:15.750]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:18.711]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:23:18.731 --> 03:23:20.993]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[03:23:25.689 --> 03:23:37.516]  Long lasting sale in the history of Infowars because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[03:23:37.916 --> 03:23:44.119]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:51.284]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[03:23:51.824 --> 03:23:53.585]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[03:24:05.457 --> 03:24:17.626]  We're going to be covering the protests that are going on in Hamburg, Germany at the G20 Summit in the next segment.
[03:24:17.746 --> 03:24:19.467]  It's honestly out of control.
[03:24:20.207 --> 03:24:27.973]  Before we get to the news we're going to cover in this segment, I have to remind you about our 4th of July mega special going on at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[03:24:28.513 --> 03:24:30.836]  Free shipping store-wide.

[03:24:38.586 --> 03:24:42.671]  DNA Force is actually a product that I take every morning and every night.
[03:24:43.172 --> 03:24:44.674]  Some of the other products I take every day.
[03:24:45.034 --> 03:24:45.855]  Nascent Iodine.
[03:24:46.596 --> 03:24:49.618]  Survival Shield X2 also 30% off.
[03:24:49.978 --> 03:24:56.761]  The all-new Mico ZX Fungus and Yeast Cleanser is also back at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:24:56.781 --> 03:25:00.904]  These products are so popular because they work so great and then they sell out.
[03:25:01.704 --> 03:25:05.828]  And so it takes us some time to get them back in stock, but that is back in stock.
[03:25:05.908 --> 03:25:12.453]  And again, 4th of July, Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:12.733 --> 03:25:16.036]  How about 30% off Brain Force, folks?
[03:25:16.136 --> 03:25:23.102]  These are 360 win deals, free shipping store-wide, so it doesn't matter how many products you order, it doesn't matter how big the products are.
[03:25:23.122 --> 03:25:24.904]  You can get hats, t-shirts.
[03:25:25.464 --> 03:25:34.913]  Emergency food supplies, brain force, micro ZX, DNA force, and all of that will be under the umbrella of free shipping.
[03:25:35.113 --> 03:25:38.156]  So, oh yeah, don't forget the CNN is fake news t-shirt.
[03:25:39.017 --> 03:25:44.202]  That's a hot seller right now, and it's a great way to find like-minded people.
[03:25:44.662 --> 03:25:48.166]  And, you know, maybe you're walking behind a CNN set or a fake news set.
[03:25:48.446 --> 03:25:50.368]  You know, here was one I was actually thinking about.
[03:25:51.781 --> 03:25:53.982]  Wear your CNN is fake news shirt.
[03:25:54.102 --> 03:25:56.343]  Wear your CNN is terrorist shirt.
[03:25:56.684 --> 03:25:58.524]  Wear your Trump is my president shirt.
[03:25:59.085 --> 03:26:01.466]  Wear these shirts with these powerful messages on them.
[03:26:01.966 --> 03:26:06.949]  And I was thinking, we're always trying to get behind a news broadcast, and we're always trying to get in a news broadcast.
[03:26:07.449 --> 03:26:09.631]  And they're kind of getting wise to this.
[03:26:09.671 --> 03:26:10.872]  They're going through tactics.
[03:26:10.892 --> 03:26:16.237]  They're making bigger stages, putting them higher, putting them on roofs, creating like a 30-foot space.
[03:26:16.277 --> 03:26:17.118]  You can't even reach them.
[03:26:17.138 --> 03:26:22.482]  You know, security detail that rushes them out of the studio and then into a blacked-out car they drive away in.
[03:26:23.303 --> 03:26:24.764]  Here's another thing that you could do.
[03:26:25.264 --> 03:26:32.126]  Put your CNN is fake news t-shirt on, put your Trump is my president shirt on, and then go sit in the front row at a sporting event.
[03:26:32.527 --> 03:26:35.928]  I can't believe this is something that we haven't thought of or discussed.
[03:26:36.248 --> 03:26:40.990]  You sit in the front row behind a baseball game, there's like 20 people that are on camera for the entire nine innings.
[03:26:41.330 --> 03:26:51.614]  You go, everybody's seen the wrestling memes that they're putting out, you sit in the front row at a wrestling match, you wear your Make America Free Again hat from Infowars.com, that product unfortunately is gone now, a great hat, wear your Trump hat.
[03:26:51.914 --> 03:26:59.778]  Where your CNN is fake news t-shirt on under it, you'll be in the entire video, the entire time, and for entire history.
[03:27:00.258 --> 03:27:03.120]  So you can literally get that message in there for entire history.
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:04.761]  Go to a basketball game, a football game, whatever it is.
[03:27:05.101 --> 03:27:06.902]  Where your CNN is a terrorist t-shirt.
[03:27:07.282 --> 03:27:08.963]  Where your CNN is fake news t-shirt.
[03:27:09.323 --> 03:27:12.045]  If you got on a broadcast for nine innings of a baseball game,
[03:27:12.845 --> 03:27:13.646]  Sitting in the front row.
[03:27:13.686 --> 03:27:17.508]  I have a feeling that... I'm not speaking for Alex, I just have a feeling that that would count.
[03:27:18.108 --> 03:27:21.970]  Alright, so take advantage of the 4th of July Mega Specials.
[03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:25.792]  Take advantage of the meme contest going on at InfoWars.com right now.

[03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:41.984]  Alright, before we take this break, this is a clip from Linda Sarsour.
[03:27:42.004 --> 03:27:48.990]  You know, I interviewed somebody that's, we're gonna air the interview tonight on the Nightly News, that infiltrated CARE here in America.
[03:27:49.570 --> 03:27:51.412]  Pretty incredible stuff that he talked about.
[03:27:51.632 --> 03:27:54.515]  Now here's one of the leading agents of CARE, Linda Sarsour.
[03:27:55.225 --> 03:28:00.868]  Sisters and brothers, it's been 16, almost 17 years since the horrific attacks of 9-11.
[03:28:01.048 --> 03:28:02.388]  This is really amazing.
[03:28:02.408 --> 03:28:04.849]  And we still as a community find ourselves unprepared.
[03:28:04.889 --> 03:28:10.372]  So we're led to believe that 9-11 was done by radical Islamic terrorists, but listen to how she spins it.
[03:28:10.812 --> 03:28:15.016]  It's the Trump administration that's waging chaos against Muslims now.
[03:28:15.096 --> 03:28:16.297]  It's a travel ban, not a Muslim ban.
[03:28:16.317 --> 03:28:17.618]  This is an agent of Hamas, folks.
[03:28:40.380 --> 03:28:41.780]  I was alleging it for a long time.
[03:28:42.420 --> 03:28:43.021]  We know it now.
[03:28:43.061 --> 03:28:43.741]  Tyrants.
[03:28:43.761 --> 03:28:44.721]  Speaking for Sharia law.
[03:28:44.741 --> 03:28:45.041]  There it is.
[03:28:45.061 --> 03:28:46.302]  Islamophobes in the White House.
[03:28:46.322 --> 03:28:47.922]  White supremacists in the White House.
[03:28:47.942 --> 03:28:48.423]  You know what?
[03:28:48.443 --> 03:28:49.103]  I'm done with this girl.
[03:28:49.123 --> 03:28:50.783]  Look, this woman is an enemy of the free world, okay?
[03:28:50.904 --> 03:28:52.744]  And by the way, for a white supremacist,
[03:29:08.483 --> 03:29:13.830]  I believe he just appointed a black man to be the Surgeon General, so not a very good white supremacist is President Trump.
[03:29:14.270 --> 03:29:19.717]  But look, CAIR is a wing of Hamas, okay?
[03:29:20.258 --> 03:29:24.943]  Linda Sarsour is an agent of Hamas sent to America to trick
[03:29:26.019 --> 03:29:31.424]  Easily brainwashed people to believing the false narrative that Sharia law is not here to dominate them.
[03:29:31.724 --> 03:29:34.146]  Do you really want your women to look like Linda Sarsour?
[03:29:34.606 --> 03:29:37.069]  Do you really want American women to look like Linda Sarsour?
[03:29:37.089 --> 03:29:38.170]  They can't even show their face?
[03:29:38.190 --> 03:29:39.290]  They can't even show their hair?
[03:29:40.792 --> 03:29:41.192]  No!
[03:29:41.653 --> 03:29:42.673]  This is America!
[03:29:42.693 --> 03:29:44.515]  This isn't Sharia law!
[03:29:44.895 --> 03:29:51.121]  It's time for people to realize that CARE is Hamas, a terrorist organization infiltrating this country!
[03:29:52.369 --> 03:29:55.372]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.292 --> 03:29:59.095]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.218 --> 03:30:05.480]  Hi, I'm the Democratic National Committee.
[03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:09.163]  I got hacked by the Russians and all my emails got out to the public.
[03:30:09.904 --> 03:30:15.849]  I had undercover journalists expose that I stage protests and will use violence and cheating to win.
[03:30:15.929 --> 03:30:19.232]  I had to fire the head of my committee because she was incompetent.
[03:30:19.352 --> 03:30:22.855]  My presidential candidate had an illegal private server with classified documents.
[03:30:22.955 --> 03:30:27.578]  But when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials, we would not give it to them.
[03:30:28.319 --> 03:30:32.982]  That same presidential candidate was married to an impeached former president who is also a rapist.
[03:30:33.162 --> 03:30:41.108]  My last president is also involved, as he has absconded and is hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public.
[03:30:41.568 --> 03:30:48.074]  I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year.
[03:30:48.134 --> 03:30:52.097]  I had multiple members of my party arrested for pedophilic activity this year.
[03:30:53.638 --> 03:30:55.140]  Have I mentioned Trump-Russia yet?
[03:30:56.361 --> 03:31:00.084]  For InfoWars.com, that's the DNC, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:03.050 --> 03:31:09.214]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:31:09.595 --> 03:31:12.497]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:31:12.817 --> 03:31:18.020]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:31:18.441 --> 03:31:24.425]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:31:24.565 --> 03:31:27.687]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:31:27.847 --> 03:31:29.308]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[03:31:29.488 --> 03:31:33.629]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:31:33.829 --> 03:31:36.690]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:31:36.770 --> 03:31:38.330]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:31:38.430 --> 03:31:41.611]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:31:41.891 --> 03:31:44.211]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:31:44.491 --> 03:31:45.471]  It's in powder form.
[03:31:45.551 --> 03:31:48.252]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:31:48.432 --> 03:31:49.032]  I take this.
[03:31:49.152 --> 03:31:50.832]  This is the product that I take.

[03:33:11.961 --> 03:33:18.724]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.044 --> 03:33:22.185]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:22.225 --> 03:33:28.988]  We're going to cover the G20 protests going on in Hamburg right now in Germany.
[03:33:29.789 --> 03:33:31.449]  They're absolutely out of control.
[03:33:32.270 --> 03:33:38.832]  Pretty unbelievable imagery we're going to be showing you, but I'm sitting here and I'm always watching the news, folks.
[03:33:38.932 --> 03:33:39.913]  I've always got
[03:33:40.896 --> 03:33:44.118]  Every news broadcast, I've got my finger on the pulse of what's going on.
[03:33:44.138 --> 03:33:52.503]  It's just amazing, because I'm sitting here thinking about how we're going to cover the G20 protests going on, which they're showing live behind me right now.
[03:33:52.543 --> 03:33:59.227]  You can see these monster police trucks being drove onto the scene, firing water cannons at people.
[03:33:59.287 --> 03:34:04.870]  The streets literally packed with protesters in all different kind of outfits and this, that, and the other thing.
[03:34:05.630 --> 03:34:09.873]  And I'm sitting here thinking about how we're going to cover this, when all of a sudden
[03:34:11.258 --> 03:34:22.186]  One of the mainstream news networks flips over to cover Venezuela for a second and it's like, oh yeah, that's right, there's massive protests and rioting going on in Venezuela right now!
[03:34:23.787 --> 03:34:25.468]  How can we forget about that?
[03:34:25.628 --> 03:34:28.970]  Venezuela is absolutely falling apart right now.
[03:34:30.211 --> 03:34:32.513]  And it's just amazing because you see all this going on.
[03:34:33.857 --> 03:34:43.162]  You see the things that Nikki Haley is saying, and she continues to have war rhetoric again today, today talking about how we will defend ourselves.
[03:34:44.302 --> 03:34:51.226]  Folks, when we elected Donald Trump, we changed the status quo.
[03:34:51.266 --> 03:35:00.511]  We took the status quo back from the establishment, and now we are in control of the status quo, and that is why CNN is now fake news and a meme.
[03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:11.856]  The globalists, the establishment, are going to do something drastic in an attempt to retake the status quo.
[03:35:12.397 --> 03:35:14.979]  And I can just really see all of it.
[03:35:16.291 --> 03:35:17.952]  We're good to go.
[03:35:44.656 --> 03:35:45.417]  But it's just amazing.
[03:35:45.977 --> 03:35:49.039]  I'll try to focus on the G20 right now, because it's going on right now.
[03:35:50.381 --> 03:35:51.922]  You've got protesters in the streets.
[03:35:52.822 --> 03:35:57.646]  And I'm looking at these protesters, and I'm just saying, okay, who are these people?
[03:35:58.187 --> 03:35:59.307]  What are they protesting?
[03:35:59.508 --> 03:36:03.291]  Why are they out on the streets so ferociously?
[03:36:04.452 --> 03:36:08.835]  Why do the police need to have thousands of armored police out there with riot shields?
[03:36:09.235 --> 03:36:11.817]  Why do they need to have police tanks, essentially?
[03:36:11.837 --> 03:36:13.258]  Okay, you can call them a truck.
[03:36:14.324 --> 03:36:21.169]  Why do they need to have police trucks with water cannons, police fully armed, riot shields, riot helmets, all of this going on?
[03:36:21.649 --> 03:36:22.870]  Why is all of this going on?
[03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:24.131]  What is going on?
[03:36:24.571 --> 03:36:26.813]  Why is the G20 such a tipping point?
[03:36:28.074 --> 03:36:31.997]  Why hasn't it been such a powder keg in the past?
[03:36:33.598 --> 03:36:34.919]  And it's all the same pattern.
[03:36:34.959 --> 03:36:36.440]  It's all the same story.
[03:36:37.581 --> 03:36:43.165]  George Soros funded groups are trying to destabilize these countries
[03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:45.929]  Which can go in so many different angles.
[03:36:45.969 --> 03:36:49.190]  You can destabilize and bring in martial law, bring in the police state.
[03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:52.331]  You can destabilize and fund an overall bigger war.
[03:36:53.131 --> 03:36:55.391]  You can destabilize and then have regime change.
[03:36:55.651 --> 03:37:01.593]  So there's all different angles that they can use this destabilization tactic in order to reach an end.
[03:37:01.993 --> 03:37:07.374]  But I'm just sitting here and I'm just thinking, what do these people think is going on?
[03:37:08.780 --> 03:37:11.823]  Why are they so animate about this protest?
[03:37:11.864 --> 03:37:13.746]  Because I've done this dozens of times.
[03:37:13.786 --> 03:37:14.346]  I'm not the only one.
[03:37:14.386 --> 03:37:15.788]  There's other people that have gone out on the streets.
[03:37:16.028 --> 03:37:17.309]  We talked to the protesters here.
[03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:19.872]  They all, they have different reasons for their protest.
[03:37:19.932 --> 03:37:26.740]  Immigration, you know, travel ban, Muslim ban, white supremacy, Nazis, you know, they throw all these little virtue signaling words in there.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:27.820]  But it's all the same thing.
[03:37:28.201 --> 03:37:29.181]  It's anti-Trump.
[03:37:29.241 --> 03:37:29.921]  We hate Trump.
[03:37:30.001 --> 03:37:31.782]  We don't want Trump to be president.
[03:37:31.862 --> 03:37:32.943]  We are sore losers.
[03:37:33.283 --> 03:37:34.103]  We are immature.
[03:37:34.463 --> 03:37:36.004]  We don't have a life of our own.
[03:37:36.384 --> 03:37:37.665]  So we're going to go out and protest.
[03:37:37.765 --> 03:37:42.907]  So is that the same thing that's going on with these G20 protesters in Hamburg?
[03:37:43.547 --> 03:37:45.148]  That can only be the assumption.
[03:37:46.168 --> 03:37:54.572]  And then you look at some of these pictures, you see that they've got people... I mean, folks, you are looking at footage... I mean, again...
[03:37:56.069 --> 03:38:00.491]  Police trucks, water cannoning people, riot police out in full force.
[03:38:02.412 --> 03:38:04.133]  I don't even know what they're protesting!
[03:38:05.114 --> 03:38:09.956]  There's no message, there's no unification, none of the signs even make sense.
[03:38:10.297 --> 03:38:12.598]  Half of- look at this woman, she's got a bunny mask on!
[03:38:13.999 --> 03:38:14.839]  Nice bunny mask!
[03:38:15.019 --> 03:38:17.280]  So again, what am I supposed to think about these people?
[03:38:17.660 --> 03:38:18.841]  Why are they protesting?
[03:38:20.982 --> 03:38:21.523]  But there's that...
[03:38:22.486 --> 03:38:23.767]  There's that lingering thought.
[03:38:24.027 --> 03:38:26.529]  There's that lingering common denominator.
[03:38:26.970 --> 03:38:28.070]  That is President Trump.
[03:38:30.112 --> 03:38:34.095]  And so these are all the liberals, and keep in mind that Merkel is in an election year.
[03:38:34.135 --> 03:38:37.438]  She's trying to do anything she can to try to save her position.
[03:38:38.772 --> 03:38:44.216]  Including sending out SWAT teams, essentially, raiding people's homes for posts on social media.
[03:38:44.256 --> 03:38:56.566]  So now, if you post something that is probably, you know, anti-immigration, anti-Merkel, anti-European Union, well, you might get raided.
[03:38:56.586 --> 03:38:59.188]  A police officer might be at your door.
[03:39:00.669 --> 03:39:05.232]  Oh wow, all of a sudden you don't want to tweet something or post something negative about Merkel, huh?
[03:39:06.247 --> 03:39:10.749]  But you've got protests on the streets in full force.
[03:39:11.049 --> 03:39:13.250]  So again, the whole thing to me just doesn't make any sense.
[03:39:14.170 --> 03:39:16.011]  Pretty typical of these protesters.
[03:39:16.091 --> 03:39:17.231]  They don't have a clue.
[03:39:17.671 --> 03:39:19.752]  Their head isn't even screwed onto their shoulders.
[03:39:20.512 --> 03:39:25.034]  And if you were actually to go ask these people, hey, why are you out here protesting?
[03:39:25.654 --> 03:39:28.095]  My guess is they wouldn't have an answer.
[03:39:28.115 --> 03:39:29.796]  I mean, look at this one.
[03:39:30.376 --> 03:39:32.857]  This is on a CNN story, a video on the story.
[03:39:34.318 --> 03:39:37.080]  Zombies descend on Hamburg for G20 protests.
[03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:43.085]  You have people that have literally spent hours to dress themselves up as zombies.
[03:39:43.865 --> 03:39:47.508]  I don't know what, it looks like they just covered themselves in grey paint or something.
[03:39:48.569 --> 03:39:54.133]  So they spend all this time to dress themselves up as zombies and walk the streets in protest at the G20 Summit.
[03:39:54.173 --> 03:39:54.854]  There's the video.
[03:39:56.355 --> 03:39:56.655]  Why?
[03:39:58.176 --> 03:39:59.297]  What have you accomplished?
[03:39:59.938 --> 03:40:00.918]  What is your message?
[03:40:02.039 --> 03:40:02.760]  What is this, art?
[03:40:05.372 --> 03:40:11.077]  Okay, so a thousand people dressed as zombies and marched at the G20 Summit.
[03:40:11.137 --> 03:40:12.598]  Again, why?
[03:40:12.838 --> 03:40:14.079]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[03:40:14.099 --> 03:40:26.969]  To me this just looks like the brainwashed masses that have nothing better to do are willing to go out and spend their time in the streets protesting because they have nothing else.
[03:40:28.336 --> 03:40:29.997]  They have nothing else that brings them together.
[03:40:30.017 --> 03:40:31.959]  They have nothing else that they can say they've accomplished.
[03:40:32.399 --> 03:40:34.441]  So this, to them, is their moment.
[03:40:34.521 --> 03:40:36.603]  This, to them, is their accomplishment.
[03:40:37.043 --> 03:40:38.404]  This is their group.
[03:40:38.884 --> 03:40:39.985]  These are their people.
[03:40:40.326 --> 03:40:43.528]  And this is how they are impacting the world.
[03:40:45.089 --> 03:40:49.633]  Okay, so... That's going on at G20.
[03:40:49.673 --> 03:40:51.915]  We'll keep our fingers to the pulse of that.
[03:40:51.995 --> 03:40:54.257]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump was in Poland today.
[03:40:54.297 --> 03:40:56.719]  We've already talked about this, but it needs to be mentioned.
[03:40:58.055 --> 03:41:17.420]  Donald Trump shows up, Poland prepares a great welcome for him, you've got more people that show up to see and hear Donald Trump in Poland for today's event than you had for the entire 2016 campaign, people showing up for Hillary Clinton in America.
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:24.962]  So you've got more people willing to show up for Donald Trump in Poland than you had people that were willing to show up for Hillary Clinton in America.
[03:41:25.967 --> 03:41:26.788]  That's just the numbers.
[03:41:26.828 --> 03:41:27.649]  That's just the optics.
[03:41:27.689 --> 03:41:28.550]  You can see that for yourself.
[03:41:28.951 --> 03:41:30.513]  Then they're chanting Donald Trump.
[03:41:30.814 --> 03:41:32.035]  They're loving Donald Trump.
[03:41:32.055 --> 03:41:33.517]  They're waving American flags.
[03:41:33.557 --> 03:41:36.882]  They're donning American flags at restaurants in Poland.
[03:41:38.476 --> 03:41:40.278]  But CNN couldn't handle it, could they?
[03:41:40.898 --> 03:41:45.362]  The meme known as CNN couldn't handle it.
[03:41:46.123 --> 03:41:50.106]  And I'm telling you, they are outing themselves, they are showing their hands.
[03:41:50.627 --> 03:41:58.693]  Everything that they're accusing of Trump, everything that they're accusing of conservatives, alt-right, whatever they want to say, they're guilty of.
[03:41:59.594 --> 03:42:00.675]  They are the ones that did it.
[03:42:00.755 --> 03:42:01.776]  The Russia collusions?
[03:42:02.477 --> 03:42:03.458]  That was the Democrats.
[03:42:03.598 --> 03:42:04.659]  That was Hillary Clinton.
[03:42:05.059 --> 03:42:05.700]  The violence?
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:09.267]  The violence after the election?
[03:42:09.588 --> 03:42:11.052]  They said that that was going to be Trump supporters?
[03:42:11.413 --> 03:42:11.614]  Nope!
[03:42:11.754 --> 03:42:12.917]  Ended up being Bernie supporters.
[03:42:12.977 --> 03:42:14.201]  Ended up being Trump haters.
[03:42:17.028 --> 03:42:18.388]  So it just goes on and on.
[03:42:19.289 --> 03:42:23.990]  Now, oh yeah, the Trump voters won't accept the results of the election.
[03:42:24.330 --> 03:42:28.192]  Meanwhile, here seven months later, the Democrats still haven't accepted the results of the election.
[03:42:28.252 --> 03:42:33.153]  So again, they take what they're guilty of and then they point the finger at you for what they're guilty of.
[03:42:33.693 --> 03:42:34.874]  This is another example of it.
[03:42:34.974 --> 03:42:36.994]  This is how we know who they really are.
[03:42:37.955 --> 03:42:38.835]  This is from CNN.
[03:42:39.855 --> 03:42:44.457]  Conservative Polish politicians bus people in for Trump speech.
[03:42:44.957 --> 03:42:45.237]  Okay.
[03:42:46.471 --> 03:42:48.592]  Now, they don't have any proof.
[03:42:48.973 --> 03:42:50.594]  They don't really have any hard evidence.
[03:42:50.674 --> 03:42:51.875]  They don't really know this.
[03:42:52.635 --> 03:42:55.317]  They just assume that that's the case.
[03:42:56.912 --> 03:42:59.835]  They just assume that this is what's going on.
[03:42:59.875 --> 03:43:02.779]  Now, I'm not denying that this may have happened.
[03:43:02.879 --> 03:43:04.260]  Maybe some people got bused in.
[03:43:04.280 --> 03:43:04.841]  Maybe they didn't.
[03:43:04.881 --> 03:43:06.302]  Maybe it was paid for from conservatives.
[03:43:06.683 --> 03:43:08.825]  But they don't actually offer any evidence.
[03:43:08.845 --> 03:43:10.427]  They don't show you the buses.
[03:43:10.747 --> 03:43:12.810]  They don't really tell you how it all went down.
[03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:16.574]  Oh, but what they did do was they exposed their own hand, didn't they?
[03:43:17.711 --> 03:43:34.026]  You see, we've been reporting on George Soros groups and similar groups paying for Trump protesters to get bused in, they get a lunch, they go on the same bus, they show up, they protest Trump for a couple hours, they get lunch, they get on the bus, and then they all go home.
[03:43:34.526 --> 03:43:38.449]  This has been documented, this has been admitted, this is well known.
[03:43:39.471 --> 03:43:43.092]  So this is what the Democrats do in order to win.
[03:43:43.713 --> 03:43:48.434]  This is their version of win, paying people to go out and have their message heard.
[03:43:49.415 --> 03:43:55.036]  So they just assume that that's the explanation for why Trump is so popular in Poland.
[03:43:55.377 --> 03:43:59.618]  You see, this is how out of touch with reality they are, but this is how they think.
[03:44:00.158 --> 03:44:01.519]  See, they're letting you in on how they think.
[03:44:02.810 --> 03:44:03.430]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:05.731]  Obviously a piece of trash candidate.
[03:44:06.231 --> 03:44:07.531]  Obviously not popular.
[03:44:07.891 --> 03:44:09.051]  Nobody likes Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:09.391 --> 03:44:10.872]  Can't get anyone to show up for events.
[03:44:11.192 --> 03:44:19.533]  The only time they can even hope to have anybody show up is if they bring LeBron James out or bring Jay-Z out or have Madonna up on the stage saying how she wants to blow up the White House.
[03:44:19.934 --> 03:44:22.614]  If you have Hillary Clinton shows up, nobody cares.
[03:44:22.894 --> 03:44:23.434]  Nobody goes.
[03:44:23.534 --> 03:44:25.695]  Nobody wants to see Bill Clinton unless they're protesting him.
[03:44:26.075 --> 03:44:27.315]  Nobody wants to see Tim Kaine.
[03:44:27.415 --> 03:44:28.095]  Literally nobody.
[03:44:28.415 --> 03:44:28.895]  So nobody.
[03:44:29.055 --> 03:44:29.376]  Nothing.
[03:44:29.496 --> 03:44:30.636]  These people are not popular.
[03:44:30.696 --> 03:44:31.356]  Nobody cares about them.
[03:44:31.696 --> 03:44:32.857]  So the Democrats know this.
[03:44:32.897 --> 03:44:34.759]  I mean, they know Hillary wasn't really popular.
[03:44:34.779 --> 03:44:36.180]  I mean, they saw Hillary's speeches.
[03:44:36.260 --> 03:44:36.961]  Nobody showed up.
[03:44:38.182 --> 03:44:42.485]  So they're sitting here saying, wow, nobody shows up for Hillary events.
[03:44:42.646 --> 03:44:45.128]  Nobody shows up and chants how great Hillary is.
[03:44:45.168 --> 03:44:46.949]  We have to pay people to come to these events.
[03:44:46.969 --> 03:44:52.574]  We have to bring in celebrities, pay celebrities to come be at these events in order to get people to show up.
[03:44:52.614 --> 03:44:54.276]  So we have to use tactics
[03:44:55.669 --> 03:44:57.130]  In order to get support.
[03:44:57.170 --> 03:44:58.631]  Because we don't have support.
[03:44:59.111 --> 03:45:00.492]  We don't really have policy.
[03:45:00.533 --> 03:45:01.933]  We just have identity politics.
[03:45:02.594 --> 03:45:08.518]  So we have to use our money and our influence in order to gain support.
[03:45:08.638 --> 03:45:09.959]  Even though it's not real support.
[03:45:10.019 --> 03:45:11.120]  It's bought and paid for support.
[03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:13.081]  So that's how Hillary Clinton gets support.
[03:45:13.422 --> 03:45:15.203]  That's how George Soros movements get support.
[03:45:16.043 --> 03:45:18.685]  Donald Trump is grassroots.
[03:45:18.845 --> 03:45:19.766]  Organic support.
[03:45:20.006 --> 03:45:21.447]  People actually like Donald Trump.
[03:45:21.627 --> 03:45:23.369]  People actually resonate with Donald Trump.
[03:45:23.649 --> 03:45:25.070]  It goes all the way around the world.
[03:45:25.410 --> 03:45:29.094]  So people in Poland hear Trump is going to Poland, they want to show up in force.
[03:45:29.114 --> 03:45:32.036]  They want to show President Trump that they resonate with his message.
[03:45:32.297 --> 03:45:34.178]  They want to show their support for President Trump.
[03:45:34.218 --> 03:45:38.723]  They're chanting Trump in the streets, chanting President Trump, making a huge welcome party.
[03:45:39.023 --> 03:45:39.964]  So what do the Democrats do?
[03:45:40.004 --> 03:45:41.966]  They say, well this can't be.
[03:45:43.220 --> 03:45:44.021]  What does CNN say?
[03:45:44.041 --> 03:45:45.141]  CNN says, no way.
[03:45:45.842 --> 03:45:46.762]  This can't be possible.
[03:45:46.802 --> 03:45:49.864]  How is it that Donald Trump could be popular in Poland?
[03:45:50.525 --> 03:46:02.633]  After all the fake news that we have spread about President Trump, after all of the lies and the slander and the libel that we have waged on Donald Trump and his family and his administration, how can this be?
[03:46:02.993 --> 03:46:04.294]  How can he be so popular?
[03:46:04.574 --> 03:46:12.199]  How can President Trump go to Poland and get thousands and thousands of people to show up and chant and march and wave American flags?
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:14.342]  Get that at a Hillary event!
[03:46:14.742 --> 03:46:17.306]  What is going on here?
[03:46:17.326 --> 03:46:17.366]  Oh!
[03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.530]  Ah!
[03:46:20.050 --> 03:46:21.372]  They must be bussing him in!
[03:46:21.673 --> 03:46:23.055]  They must be paying for them!
[03:46:23.255 --> 03:46:24.237]  This can't be real!
[03:46:24.838 --> 03:46:25.418]  That's right!
[03:46:26.823 --> 03:46:29.444]  This is how the left thinks, folks.
[03:46:30.164 --> 03:46:31.745]  So they really don't get it.
[03:46:31.785 --> 03:46:32.365]  It's like the same thing.
[03:46:32.385 --> 03:46:33.406]  They can't admit they're wrong.
[03:46:33.686 --> 03:46:34.506]  So they really don't get it.
[03:46:34.546 --> 03:46:36.847]  They can't accept the fact that Trump is popular.
[03:46:37.127 --> 03:46:40.629]  They can't accept the fact that President Trump is beloved around the world.
[03:46:40.909 --> 03:46:46.671]  They can't accept the fact that organically and of the grassroots, President Trump has worldwide support.
[03:46:46.971 --> 03:46:51.413]  They can't accept it because there's only one reality in their mind, and that's their reality.
[03:46:51.653 --> 03:46:55.215]  So if there's anything else that goes against their reality, it can't be real.
[03:46:55.495 --> 03:46:57.176]  So they can't wrap their heads around it.
[03:46:57.376 --> 03:46:58.156]  So what do they do?
[03:46:58.556 --> 03:47:11.680]  They assume that the tactics that they used to make Hillary Clinton appear popular, to make their anti-Trump protests appear popular, they're assuming that those same tactics are now being used to make Donald Trump look popular.
[03:47:11.961 --> 03:47:15.562]  They don't get it that President Trump is actually popular.
[03:47:15.802 --> 03:47:18.623]  People actually love and support President Trump.
[03:47:19.103 --> 03:47:24.765]  Not fake, paid for, bought support, George Soros style that they had for Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:25.799 --> 03:47:36.169]  And that's why when I saw this story on CNN, trying to make up the excuse that all this support for President Trump in Poland can't be real, they're bussing them in!
[03:47:36.549 --> 03:47:38.611]  They're using the George Soros tactic!
[03:47:39.092 --> 03:47:45.878]  Of course they won't admit to that, they won't admit that that's actually how they're thinking, but that's what they're doing, and it all makes sense, folks.
[03:47:47.019 --> 03:47:47.900]  President Trump
[03:47:50.002 --> 03:47:52.524]  I don't even... He's trumped them!
[03:47:52.564 --> 03:47:53.584]  He's literally trumped them!
[03:47:53.784 --> 03:47:54.865]  There is no other word.
[03:47:55.505 --> 03:47:56.906]  There is no other phrase.
[03:47:56.986 --> 03:47:59.408]  There is no other word in the dictionary to explain it.
[03:47:59.908 --> 03:48:02.950]  President Trump has trumped the liberal media.
[03:48:03.330 --> 03:48:08.213]  President Trump has trumped the Democrats because they don't know what to do.
[03:48:09.161 --> 03:48:19.623]  When they try to explain how all this is happening, they show you the blueprint, how they got to where they were, and then on the back end, it only makes Trump more popular, and then less popular.
[03:48:20.363 --> 03:48:21.704]  I mean, this is a 360 win.
[03:48:22.004 --> 03:48:23.804]  This is how you Trump the establishment.
[03:48:24.644 --> 03:48:25.864]  With President Trump.
[03:48:26.544 --> 03:48:38.887]  So, it's unbelievable that President Trump goes to Poland, it's more support, more patriotism, more Americana in Poland for President Trump, than you had the entire 2016 campaign combined for Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:40.635 --> 03:48:43.256]  And the left, they don't know what to do.
[03:48:43.496 --> 03:48:44.717]  They don't know how to explain it.
[03:48:44.877 --> 03:48:46.237]  They must be bussing people in.
[03:48:47.057 --> 03:48:47.878]  That has to be it.
[03:48:47.918 --> 03:48:50.019]  There's no way President Trump is popular.
[03:48:50.319 --> 03:48:51.179]  Didn't you hear me?
[03:48:51.199 --> 03:48:53.680]  I said Trump was a racist.
[03:48:54.300 --> 03:48:55.921]  Did you not hear what I said?
[03:48:56.321 --> 03:48:57.721]  President Trump is racist.
[03:48:57.941 --> 03:48:59.022]  Why do you still like him?
[03:48:59.262 --> 03:49:00.562]  I said President Trump is racist.
[03:49:01.083 --> 03:49:02.283]  Oh my gosh, they still like him.
[03:49:02.323 --> 03:49:02.903]  What is going on?
[03:49:02.923 --> 03:49:03.844]  They must be bussing him in.
[03:49:04.444 --> 03:49:04.784]  That's it.
[03:49:05.524 --> 03:49:07.305]  They must be using our tactic now.
[03:49:08.863 --> 03:49:11.765]  No folks, President Trump is the real deal.
[03:49:12.305 --> 03:49:14.206]  President Trump is really popular around the world.
[03:49:14.246 --> 03:49:17.368]  We finally have a President of the United States.
[03:49:18.108 --> 03:49:24.632]  And by the way, Jason Chaffetz comes out the other day and gives Congress a hard time.
[03:49:25.152 --> 03:49:28.994]  Says Congress has nothing to point at to say we're victorious.
[03:49:29.934 --> 03:49:33.977]  They have nothing to point at to say this is what we've done, this is what we've accomplished.
[03:49:34.437 --> 03:49:35.898]  And so then what happens today?
[03:49:37.307 --> 03:49:45.995]  Congress joins Trump war on regulations, cuts a year's worth of Obama regulations in one week!
[03:49:47.576 --> 03:50:00.868]  Congressional lawmakers have gone all in on President Trump's bid to slash Obama-era regulations, targeting $19 billion in rules and the elimination of enough red tape to free up 5,200 federal workers.
[03:50:03.988 --> 03:50:10.253]  The cuts proposed by the House Appropriations Committee this week amount to a year's worth of regulations under the Obama administration.
[03:50:10.394 --> 03:50:11.354]  So how do you like that?
[03:50:12.335 --> 03:50:13.977]  The Obama cuts are real.
[03:50:14.237 --> 03:50:15.558]  They're coming in full force.
[03:50:15.878 --> 03:50:17.440]  President Trump is kicking ass.
[03:50:17.940 --> 03:50:23.845]  I mean, and honestly, you know, sometimes you just, it's like, how do you even come up here and report on how victorious we've been?
[03:50:24.866 --> 03:50:26.688]  Of course we haven't had the ultimate victory yet.
[03:50:26.728 --> 03:50:27.989]  Of course we're still in the matrix.
[03:50:28.029 --> 03:50:29.770]  Of course we're still in the controlled paradigm.
[03:50:30.851 --> 03:50:31.811]  Yes, this is all going on.
[03:50:32.152 --> 03:50:34.113]  But we're slowly breaking the shackles.
[03:50:34.153 --> 03:50:35.673]  We're slowly breaking the chains.
[03:50:35.713 --> 03:50:37.234]  We're slowly freeing more minds.
[03:50:37.274 --> 03:50:41.096]  We're slowly lighting brush fires of liberty everywhere around the world.
[03:50:42.477 --> 03:50:43.557]  So, but don't you worry.
[03:50:44.538 --> 03:50:45.358]  Oh, don't you worry.
[03:50:45.398 --> 03:50:46.719]  The left has a plan, folks.
[03:50:46.959 --> 03:50:48.419]  The globalists have a response plan.
[03:50:48.439 --> 03:50:52.601]  In fact, we've got more news on the violence coming from the left on the other side of this break.
[03:50:52.942 --> 03:50:53.522]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:50:53.682 --> 03:50:54.822]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:54.902 --> 03:50:55.943]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[03:50:56.003 --> 03:50:57.344]  Final segment on the other side.
[03:50:57.724 --> 03:51:00.005]  The left is committing to violence, folks.
[03:51:07.395 --> 03:51:16.931]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[03:51:17.927 --> 03:51:19.808]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[03:51:20.549 --> 03:51:23.911]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsTore.com?
[03:51:24.272 --> 03:51:26.273]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[03:51:27.014 --> 03:51:27.654]  And it's simple.
[03:51:28.255 --> 03:51:33.358]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[03:51:33.819 --> 03:51:34.799]  And there's a nexus point.
[03:51:34.900 --> 03:51:37.682]  There's quality versus price.
[03:51:37.742 --> 03:51:39.623]  And those two points have to come together.
[03:51:40.244 --> 03:51:45.648]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[03:51:46.488 --> 03:51:53.203]  ...has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[03:51:54.565 --> 03:51:56.806]  The true next generation in body armor.
[03:51:57.026 --> 03:52:07.430]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:09.711]  It's nanotube technology.
[03:52:10.291 --> 03:52:11.832]  It's created here in Texas.
[03:52:12.452 --> 03:52:19.515]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[03:52:19.995 --> 03:52:31.804]  We used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[03:52:32.164 --> 03:52:37.168]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at M4WarStore.com right now.
[03:52:37.388 --> 03:52:39.489]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[03:52:40.410 --> 03:52:44.573]  And we shot everything you can imagine at it.
[03:52:45.842 --> 03:52:51.791]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[03:52:52.272 --> 03:52:53.654]  It's a win-win.
[03:52:54.315 --> 03:52:53.654]  $200.
[03:52:54.896 --> 03:52:57.860]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:52:57.920 --> 03:52:58.641]  It's amazing.
[03:53:03.414 --> 03:53:04.834]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:53:05.014 --> 03:53:07.415]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[03:53:07.595 --> 03:53:14.877]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:53:15.097 --> 03:53:25.400]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:33.285]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:53:33.585 --> 03:53:43.532]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:53:43.772 --> 03:53:45.694]  And this part is most important.
[03:53:45.834 --> 03:53:52.258]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[03:53:52.638 --> 03:53:58.040]  So Linda Sarsour says that Muslims should not assimilate and fighting Trump is a form of jihad.
[03:53:58.060 --> 03:53:59.100]  So that tells you two things, folks.
[03:53:59.221 --> 03:53:59.341]  One,
[03:54:22.827 --> 03:54:27.269]  You've got Muslim people that are coming here not to assimilate, but to infiltrate and take over.
[03:54:27.509 --> 03:54:30.411]  That's what the CARE organization run by Hamas is for.
[03:54:31.051 --> 03:54:34.153]  And then those fighting Trump are jihadis, so that's nice to know.

[03:55:12.336 --> 03:55:15.839]  Not big pharmaceutical companies, not advertisers like CNN.
[03:55:16.239 --> 03:55:17.220]  You, the people.
[03:55:20.182 --> 03:55:20.402]  So,
[03:55:22.284 --> 03:55:27.609]  You know, this is really a remarkable story.
[03:55:29.130 --> 03:55:32.874]  Protester arrested at Senator Flake's Tucson office.
[03:55:33.934 --> 03:55:38.058]  A protester was arrested at Senator Jeff Flake's Tucson office Thursday morning.
[03:55:38.138 --> 03:55:38.899]  That's this morning.
[03:55:40.721 --> 03:55:48.688]  And listen to what the protester said after he was arrested.
[03:55:50.066 --> 03:55:55.448]  He said this to one of the campaign staffers, or one of Senator Flake's staffers.
[03:55:56.129 --> 03:56:00.350]  He said, you know how liberals are going to solve the Republican problem?
[03:56:00.971 --> 03:56:01.751]  The staffer said, no.
[03:56:01.771 --> 03:56:05.313]  The processor went on to say, they are going to get better aim.
[03:56:05.793 --> 03:56:09.094]  The last guy that tried, but he needed a better aim.
[03:56:09.594 --> 03:56:11.215]  We will get better aim.
[03:56:14.557 --> 03:56:14.917]  Okay.
[03:56:15.997 --> 03:56:17.798]  Now, if President Trump
[03:56:19.795 --> 03:56:30.482]  Has a crooked toenail, or meets with someone that has a crooked toenail, or had a salad and at the same table there was a Russian dressing on the salad.
[03:56:30.862 --> 03:56:31.943]  He has to explain it.
[03:56:32.303 --> 03:56:33.544]  He has to disavow.
[03:56:33.864 --> 03:56:40.288]  He needs to be asked all day long, 24-7, why, what, why won't you disavow, why are you a Russian agent?
[03:56:42.014 --> 03:56:47.237]  On the other side, you've got somebody that goes to a Republican baseball practice.
[03:56:47.957 --> 03:56:51.759]  You know, this isn't said enough, folks, but think about it like this.
[03:56:52.859 --> 03:56:56.601]  Perhaps the grace of God allowed nobody to get killed that day, but think about it like this.
[03:56:57.722 --> 03:57:02.284]  You could have easily had three, four, five members of the Republican Party murdered that day.
[03:57:02.304 --> 03:57:03.425]  I mean, honestly.
[03:57:04.338 --> 03:57:06.519]  By the grace of God, that didn't happen.
[03:57:06.919 --> 03:57:08.400]  I mean, honestly, we should be thanking God.
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:12.502]  By the grace of God, nobody died that day.
[03:57:13.543 --> 03:57:18.425]  Honestly, folks, that is the... This person could have killed up to five or more people that day.
[03:57:19.005 --> 03:57:21.867]  And think about how different their story would be.
[03:57:21.967 --> 03:57:27.510]  Think about how different America would be if that guy actually, as the new protestor said, had better aim.
[03:57:27.770 --> 03:57:29.030]  He would have killed multiple people.
[03:57:29.991 --> 03:57:32.132]  Luckily for the Democrats, I guess, at this point,
[03:57:33.752 --> 03:57:36.395]  Unless you're an average Democrat constituent, apparently.
[03:57:37.275 --> 03:57:38.196]  Nobody did die.
[03:57:38.697 --> 03:57:41.279]  So they get to continue their extreme rhetoric.
[03:57:41.479 --> 03:57:43.561]  They get to continue to push violence.
[03:57:44.082 --> 03:57:53.351]  But so now they arrest another protester who says, well, we failed at trying to assassinate Republicans last time, so we're just going to get better aim, and then we're going to be victorious.
[03:57:54.412 --> 03:57:55.813]  So I can only assume that this guy
[03:57:57.941 --> 03:58:10.166]  Was going to, I guess, plan, well he was planning a sit-in at the office to demand a Better Care Reconciliation Act.
[03:58:11.226 --> 03:58:17.470]  So folks, oh by the way, Steve Scalise has just been readmitted to the hospital because of an infection.
[03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:37.403]  So I'm just curious, when is Maxine Waters, when is CNN, when is MSNBC, when is Rachel Madcow, when is Van Jones, when is Don Lemon, when are the Cuomo brothers, when are all these people that have been calling for violence against Trump, the New York Public Theater, when are they going to disavow the violence being called for by the left?
[03:58:37.664 --> 03:58:41.146]  When are they going to admit that they're lucky multiple Republicans weren't murdered?
[03:58:41.747 --> 03:58:45.454]  You stay classy in Fort Worth.
[03:58:45.594 --> 03:58:49.561]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:54.065 --> 03:58:59.931]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:59:00.131 --> 03:59:01.352]  The contest is simple.
[03:59:01.632 --> 03:59:06.898]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:59:07.098 --> 03:59:14.285]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:59:14.445 --> 03:59:21.010]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:21.090 --> 03:59:30.977]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:59:31.157 --> 03:59:38.722]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:59:38.902 --> 03:59:48.850]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:52.352]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[03:59:52.452 --> 03:59:53.333]  This is Kit Daniels.
[03:59:56.155 --> 03:59:59.718]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World
