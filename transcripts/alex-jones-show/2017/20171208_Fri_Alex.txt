[00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.594]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:17.295]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:18.977]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:21.179]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.580]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.844]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:33.950]  Well, job expectations trump even what they previously were.
[00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.372]  Record unemployment.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.861]  Record employment.
[00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.043]  We've got just all the stuff that's happening with the economy.
[00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:51.910]  We've got all the criminal investigations of the Clintons and other crime families just exploding with evidence.
[00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.854]  And my head is, again, just spinning here trying to know where to start.
[00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:00.116]  Look at this report.
[00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:01.257]  Bombshell!
[00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:05.661]  Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged the yearbook.
[00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:08.823]  And that's because they knew
[00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:23.641]  Ladies and gentlemen, they were able to test the ink and Moore has been accusing it and now is moving forward to sue her and others saying it is totally and completely made up.
[00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:28.606]  Remember like a month ago, Allred wouldn't even say if she thought the yearbook was real or not?
[00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.969]  This is really getting crazy.
[00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.994]  So that is a major touchdown in the credibility column of Roy Moore.
[00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:55.749]  And another big credibility win for him is the fact that, we're going to play this clip in a moment, Roy Moore, Putin may be right, maybe he's more akin to me than I know, said Roy Moore.
[00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.113]  Because this is the new litmus test that they engage in.
[00:02:01.223 --> 00:02:13.611]  That if you don't hate the Russians, or if you don't hate Vladimir Putin, if you don't think they're the number one enemy in the world, when it's actually the globalists that have hijacked our country, they're the main enemy, then you must be a Russki agent.
[00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:25.399]  But I've watched Russian television, not just RT, but Russian news clips online with subtitles, where they have official state-run youth meetings
[00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:36.793]  Where they educate people that Hollywood wants to break your family up, and Hollywood doesn't want you to have children, and it's a eugenics plan to break your family up to make sure that cultures collapse.
[00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:46.165]  And this is part of a larger plan to de-industrialize and destabilize nation-states, and that Russia was under this for 70-plus years under communism.
[00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:49.628]  And that's actually true!
[00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:57.551]  So there's still stay-behind networks and globalist organizations and communist groups and atheist groups in Russia.
[00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:09.534]  But the globalists hate Russia because it's woken up to the globalists and the New World Order because it's on the receiving end of it for a very, very, very long, long time.
[00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:11.955]  And so,
[00:03:13.618 --> 00:03:14.678]  It's really a litmus test.
[00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:17.539]  I mean, Russia's trying to get people to have children.
[00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.979]  They're trying to get back and have families.
[00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:27.080]  They've already gotten to enjoy political correctness and all the things that it brings with it for, again, more like 80 years.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.161]  And so they're trying to reform themselves.
[00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:31.021]  So here is Judge Roy Moore.
[00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.982]  He said that Russia was the focus of evil in the modern world.
[00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:40.603]  You could say that very well about America, couldn't you?
[00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:41.583]  Do you think?
[00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.336]  We promote a lot of bad things, you know?
[00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:47.377]  Like?
[00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:49.058]  Same-sex marriage.
[00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.061]  That's the very argument that Vladimir Putin makes.
[00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.883]  Well, then maybe Putin is right.
[00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:59.125]  Maybe he's more akin to me than I know.
[00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:02.668]  So what's really going on here?
[00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:05.630]  It's not that if two men want to marry each other,
[00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:09.989]  That I hate them, or think that they're individually bad people.
[00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:27.958]  But it's in the textbooks, it's in the government documents, that globally this move towards ending families, and setting up taxes to make it hard to have children, and confusing the sexuality of the population, is an admitted program to end civilization as we know it.
[00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:30.700]  My film, Endgame, breaks that down.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.882]  And the big digital god, the big AI technocracy that's coming in,
[00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:40.630]  It's designed to end the former human species as we know it.
[00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.832]  And so all of this is part of that.
[00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:46.215]  Now they're pushing young people.
[00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:46.956]  Be rebellious.
[00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:48.157]  Don't be with a man or woman.
[00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:49.318]  Be with a robot.
[00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:52.881]  I mean, that's all this is, is losing our humanity.
[00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:54.582]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.842 --> 00:04:56.123]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones.

[00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.231]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:35.975]  I don't want to violate anti-speech laws, anti-hate laws.
[00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:39.398]  We're not allowed to air Bing Crosby.
[00:06:40.816 --> 00:07:01.265]  I mean, I remember 10 years ago hearing the politically correct crowd didn't like it, and I thought it was a joke, but now colleges and dormitories and restaurants and corporations have self-censored and don't let this song air, along with hundreds and hundreds of others that are seen as insensitive and bad.
[00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:09.068]  Not just the word white or white Christmas, meaning snow, but also Christmas period, more and more
[00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:22.701]  Companies, more and more shopping malls, more and more event centers are only playing holiday music because hearing the word Christmas might hurt somebody's feelings.
[00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:30.869]  I remember just five years ago hearing that they wanted to ban the use of the word mother and father on school entrance forms and now they've done it.
[00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:36.445]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biological assault on men and women.
[00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:39.408]  It's a biological assault on culture.
[00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:48.216]  It is a scientific assault on anything traditional because culture and society is being overwritten by the technocracy.
[00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:54.723]  And everything must be laid waste and dumbed down before the technocracy can come in.
[00:07:55.742 --> 00:08:04.455]  When everything this artificial reality superimposes onto us, dehumanizes us, and makes us die younger.
[00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.880]  That's because it's poison!
[00:08:09.224 --> 00:08:35.573]  Before I get into the masses of news on the entire Russiagate narrative collapsing, and the fact that now we know what we already knew, that the Clintons were directing stay-behind networks in the FBI and Justice Department to criminally launch fraudulent investigations based on lies and manufactured dossiers.
[00:08:37.332 --> 00:08:41.402]  And before we get into what's happening with the economy and moves to impeach the president,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.581]  One such move that failed in a House vote yesterday.
[00:08:45.621 --> 00:09:11.385]  Before we get into all of this, and the 46 earthquakes that have shaken California over the past 24 hours, along with the worst fires in the state's history, biblical is the word, before we get into the latest bombshell, that word gets overused, that term, but let me tell you, the story up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Breitbart.com, bombshell,
[00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:17.057]  Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged the yearbook.
[00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:24.683]  And now it's come out that other notes from other women are forgeries, because Moore is starting the lawsuits.
[00:09:24.743 --> 00:09:28.246]  People are getting served, and they're going to have to turn that over.
[00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:31.589]  They're going to be forensically studied, and they're as phony as $3 bills.
[00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.532]  Or they're as phony as Obama's birth certificate.
[00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.696]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:42.257]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:53.976]  As the globalists get more and more desperate, as the American recovery comes back to a hum and now a roar, they are in full panic mode.
[00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:57.178]  But first, let me mention what political correctness is about.
[00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:11.708]  It's about scientifically creating basket cases with chips on their shoulders who can't function in society and basically become institutionalized wards of the states and are politically
[00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:37.207]  Kept or reservation warehoused groups who do not have families, who do not procreate, who do not have children, and who are extremely depressed and alone living in artificial modern bubble-style cities.
[00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:39.529]  Google, Facebook, Twitter,
[00:10:41.815 --> 00:11:02.259]  Amazon are all now building actual bubble cities within cities where these basket cases will live and well they'll have newly monthly downloads of how you talk and where you go and what you do so that they as neuroses controlled arrested development mental patients
[00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:18.223]  live in an ongoing re-education camp environment and are so wounded, so handicapped, that they will only be comfortable in those cloistered bubbles.
[00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:26.567]  This is the admitted plan, how they're going to insert people, according to their own will, into the THX 1138 labyrinth.
[00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:38.612]  That it's been their ongoing plan since it was put into popular nomenclature and culture and parlance as a Brave New World in 1932, 1961.
[00:11:38.672 --> 00:11:45.356]  Huxley wrote Brave New World Revisited, gave speeches at Berkeley, and said it's all a real plan.
[00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:46.256]  My brother runs the U.N.
[00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:48.237]  We're gonna end your families by 2020.
[00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:50.838]  Well, they're behind schedule.
[00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.321]  You have to understand, what I'm telling you is an admitted attack profile.
[00:11:58.575 --> 00:12:03.896]  Just like bombers get an attack profile, where they're taking off from, where they refuel, targets they're going to hit.
[00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:11.218]  If they can't hit those targets, secondary and third targets, how to return, where to ditch if they get hit by flak, missiles.
[00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:12.898]  It's attack profile.
[00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:16.079]  It's an exact attack.
[00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:20.040]  It's like we have the Death Star plans, we can stop it if people just decide to.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.941]  The good news is the President's listening.
[00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:27.362]  And he's gone to the top advisors and technocrats and they've admitted the plan and he's just like, we're not doing it.
[00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:32.061]  People should be thanking God every second on their knees.
[00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:33.022]  This is happening.
[00:12:33.283 --> 00:12:36.446]  We have some shot at stopping it if we just wake up to it.
[00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:46.037]  But I walked in this morning and all of a sudden heard a robot talking and turned around and it was Alexa from Amazon.
[00:12:47.619 --> 00:12:50.301]  And then I even looked, and there were two Amazon boxes sitting right by it.
[00:12:50.941 --> 00:13:00.186]  A little spy system that's been brought into the office, and then there's even boxes from Amazon, even though I've told people around here, do not buy from Amazon.
[00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:06.330]  I guess unless you can only find it there, and that's their goal, is that it'll be the only place you can get it.
[00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:09.792]  And I'm not joking when I say all that.
[00:13:10.853 --> 00:13:14.355]  I was talking to a successful business lady last night at dinner,
[00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:39.643]  at a business and news meeting and she was talking about how they were at their house and they were talking trash about Bezos and about Amazon just a few weeks ago and Alexa came on without being asked and said are you really serious you mean that think about what you just said and I've confirmed from others it's turning on it's an AI computer not the little box that's just it's tentacle
[00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:44.266]  Listening to you, tracking what you do, and collating it.
[00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:48.467]  And I told you smartphones were gonna do this 20 years ago and all about the smart TVs.
[00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:49.387]  That was their bedded plan.
[00:13:49.627 --> 00:13:53.428]  But now you invite it in and know it's listening.
[00:13:53.768 --> 00:13:56.889]  So of course Airbnbs are watching and listening to you.
[00:13:58.469 --> 00:13:58.889]  Of course!
[00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:00.009]  Don't be so naive.
[00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:02.490]  This is all just part of the conditioning process.
[00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.774]  Fox News, yeah, how to listen to everything Amazon Echo has ever heard.
[00:14:10.794 --> 00:14:19.824]  Yeah, there's even databases people are getting into on the cloud now of everything that ever went on in your house according to its code name, according to its little number.
[00:14:20.324 --> 00:14:23.648]  And if people can find that number in the database, they can listen to you.
[00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:32.572]  Just like they've got online databases for a decade where hundreds of thousands, now millions of cameras, you can access them because people never change the code names.
[00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:35.493]  You know, the code numbers that come with them out of the box.
[00:14:35.733 --> 00:14:38.173]  So you put up a surveillance camera at your business, your house, wherever.
[00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:44.635]  It isn't just you making sure that the dog walker, when you're out of town for two days, comes over and takes care of a spot.
[00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:49.836]  Hackers, governments, everybody, but mainly big AI computers.
[00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.777]  There's a big AI race between Microsoft and
[00:14:54.381 --> 00:15:01.724]  Amazon and IBM and the Chinese and the Russians, government, private, and they've got all these big AI computers.
[00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:14.128]  They admit that they're hooking into everything they can, and they have machine learning, and they have the machines creating babies, new machines, and the scientists don't even know what's going on a decade ago.
[00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:17.930]  They don't know how to program the stuff, just computers already making the new stuff.
[00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.431]  And they just come in and try to figure out how to use basically alien technology that the computers have created.
[00:15:23.611 --> 00:15:24.712]  They're alien to this planet.
[00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:25.532]  They're unofficial.
[00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:26.352]  They're silicon.
[00:15:26.512 --> 00:15:27.692]  And they're just creating all this stuff.
[00:15:27.712 --> 00:15:29.073]  They're like, we don't know what it is.
[00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:34.194]  It's like squiggly lines and symbols and weird-ass stuff and all this new dap.
[00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.655]  Who knows what's already happened?
[00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:41.216]  So, again.
[00:15:43.126 --> 00:15:48.128]  All that going on, the UK has announced they're planning to ban men talking to women.
[00:15:49.338 --> 00:15:49.758]  That's right.
[00:15:49.798 --> 00:15:50.819]  They're banning free speech.
[00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.741]  They're going to say, men cannot talk to women they don't know in public.
[00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:58.384]  If you talk to them, or any other verbal thing, it is an act of hate.
[00:15:58.784 --> 00:15:59.165]  That's it.
[00:15:59.305 --> 00:16:02.006]  Banning biological, normal human interaction.
[00:16:02.427 --> 00:16:04.708]  Merry Christmas, my fellow info warriors.
[00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:14.475]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the info war to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:28.653]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product at InfoWarsLife.com because it works so well.
[00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:31.136]  It is Alpha Power.
[00:16:32.318 --> 00:16:33.039]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:16:34.381 --> 00:16:45.646]  Alpha Power is so strong, so concentrated, that quite frankly a lot of you might want to use some of the other products we've previously come out with that are excellent but aren't anywhere as strong.
[00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:50.529]  It's hard to quantify the stamina, the energy, the libido.
[00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:53.432]  The crazed mental focus.
[00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:54.734]  But let me just say this.
[00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:56.556]  Use this with care.
[00:16:57.237 --> 00:17:02.625]  And alpha power works synergistically with super male vitality and super female vitality.
[00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:03.566]  But I want to be clear.
[00:17:04.307 --> 00:17:06.029]  We could have called this formula something like...
[00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.932]  Alpha Male or Alpha Man?
[00:17:09.372 --> 00:17:15.616]  No, it's Alpha Power because it has incredible effects in women as well.
[00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:20.479]  Ladies and gentlemen, God gave us some incredible gifts through Mother Nature.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:29.505]  And Alpha Power, I know, is going to end up probably being our number one bestseller at InfoWarsLife.com and helping you with your stamina, your life.
[00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:32.167]  It certainly has done that for me and so many others.
[00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:34.929]  And also funding the Information War Against the Global.
[00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:36.290]  So, Alpha Power.
[00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:43.352]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com, right in time to be under the tree or in the stocking.
[00:17:43.892 --> 00:17:52.714]  This is a gift you want to give yourself, and then rest assured, you're fighting the Info War, so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.
[00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:55.135]  But again, don't believe me?

[00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:07.527]  The latest addition to InfoWars live programming.
[00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:10.088]  The War Room is live weekdays, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:13.730]  Central, at InfoWars.com slash show and WarRoom.show.

[00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.254]  Subscribe for notifications.
[00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:34.419]  Owen Schroer and Roger Stone bring you the day's biggest stories, as well as the latest breaking news, with a no-holds-barred, aggressive approach and commitment to bringing you the most cutting-edge analysis and information.
[00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:40.241]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.463]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[00:19:43.943 --> 00:19:46.184]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:19:46.704 --> 00:19:48.365]  And we control the narrative now.
[00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:53.528]  This is the War Room.
[00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.431]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:04.974 --> 00:20:07.605]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.802 --> 00:20:37.983]  Well, that's the Charlie Brown Christmas.
[00:20:38.143 --> 00:20:41.085]  But you know, you can't say Christmas anymore in a musical.
[00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:42.065]  It's hateful.
[00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:48.348]  So they, I've heard, are going to rename and re-release them, just calling it Charlie Brown's Holidays.
[00:20:49.649 --> 00:20:50.789]  Now, we're not living in a cult.
[00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.870]  Let's try to destroy our free speech.
[00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.491]  No, no, no.
[00:20:53.971 --> 00:20:54.611]  Everything's fine.
[00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.673]  Again, having mothers and fathers is now bad.
[00:20:58.153 --> 00:21:00.994]  It's taught nationwide to elementary students that you're purple penguins.
[00:21:01.015 --> 00:21:02.055]  You're not boys or girls.
[00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:03.656]  We're going to screw you up.
[00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:05.568]  We're going to sexualize you.
[00:21:05.588 --> 00:21:06.689]  We're going to destroy your innocence.
[00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:10.010]  And you're going to sit there, and you're going to take it, and so are your parents.
[00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:18.914]  We're going to put you on Ritalin and Prozac and give you GMO food and let you grow big, fat, juicy tumors, and then we're going to stick you in the ground and say, bye-bye, baby.
[00:21:18.934 --> 00:21:19.974]  Because we're liberal.
[00:21:21.054 --> 00:21:24.156]  Know what you are is a scientific program of pure evil.
[00:21:25.776 --> 00:21:26.657]  This is no joke.
[00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:28.797]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[00:21:28.817 --> 00:21:30.158]  It's from Breitbart.
[00:21:31.431 --> 00:21:34.692]  Wolf whistling could become a hate crime in London, say police.
[00:21:35.132 --> 00:21:35.792]  That's how it works.
[00:21:35.812 --> 00:21:40.334]  They just say, oh, being a Nazi is a hate crime, or protesting Muslims is a hate crime.
[00:21:41.254 --> 00:21:50.617]  And then they just keep expanding and expanding to if you talk to a woman at a bus stop, that the police will decide whether it's a crime or not.
[00:21:50.637 --> 00:21:53.097]  So again, they don't say, oh, we're gonna ban your speech.
[00:21:53.337 --> 00:21:55.618]  They say, oh, we're gonna ban wolf whistling.
[00:21:57.158 --> 00:21:58.579]  We're gonna ban wolf whistling.
[00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:04.386]  But then when you actually read what the police say, it's unwanted comments or speaking to a woman.
[00:22:04.626 --> 00:22:05.687]  Notice it's to a woman!
[00:22:05.787 --> 00:22:06.949]  Oh, is it to a man too?
[00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:08.450]  Yes, mammals.
[00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:22.345]  Whether it's deer, or whether it's whales, or whether it's squirrels, males come over to females sometimes and they don't like the M, and they don't like how he looks or how he smells, and they're not in the mode to get pregnant, and so they say, get away from me!
[00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:28.294]  I've seen a male deer run up during rut to a doe and I've seen him kick him.
[00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.776]  And all of a sudden she kind of likes him and turns around.
[00:22:31.237 --> 00:22:34.179]  Or I've seen her bite him.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.081]  Or I've seen does run up to the male.
[00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:47.470]  Should we have police out there to stop the male deer, the buck, when the female is in estrus releasing eggs and he smells it?
[00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:49.793]  He is bad.
[00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:51.834]  He is trying to rape her.
[00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:56.717]  This is an attack on biology, admitted in their textbooks in the 60s.
[00:22:56.797 --> 00:23:14.705]  I mean, I've read to you the textbooks here on air that they have at the University of Texas and other major universities, the Calhoun Reader for Social Workers, where it says, families belong to the ancient times and are arcane and we will get rid of them.
[00:23:15.245 --> 00:23:16.346]  That is the plan.
[00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:20.911]  Wolf Whistle could become a hate crime in London, say police.
[00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:26.575]  You know, male birds tweet at females too.
[00:23:27.316 --> 00:23:35.442]  And male dogs will go... And male cats go... They're a tomcat?
[00:23:35.983 --> 00:23:41.327]  Everybody knows what a tomcat... Looking for a female sounds like... He's trying to rape cats!
[00:23:41.808 --> 00:23:43.189]  It should be banned as well!
[00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:51.024]  See, so they take men hitting on women, and sometimes women don't like it, and sometimes men are aggressive and they're thugs, and it's wrong.
[00:23:51.104 --> 00:23:51.865]  Just don't touch them.
[00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:55.485]  And if somebody starts harassing you, you can say, get away from me, you're harassing me.
[00:23:55.865 --> 00:24:00.186]  But just to say talking to a woman is sexual assault, that's the new thing.
[00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:08.888]  I mean, I remember hearing 20-something years ago that feminists were teaching in women's studies at major universities that all sex is rape.
[00:24:09.568 --> 00:24:11.468]  I didn't believe it until I read it in textbooks.
[00:24:11.788 --> 00:24:14.029]  Now it's mainstream, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:15.956 --> 00:24:25.162]  So again, this is the attack on biology where you get so sick of it, you're always afraid to talk to a girl or talk to a boy, so next you just watch porn or you watch sex bots.
[00:24:25.702 --> 00:24:36.529]  And now, large portions of millennials, I've got the numbers right here, say that they want to marry a sex bot.
[00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:39.912]  27% of millennials say they would consider dating a robot.
[00:24:40.934 --> 00:24:41.655]  Over humans.
[00:24:42.455 --> 00:24:46.738]  That's because they're so used to their devices and their machines, and it's a big problem.
[00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:49.480]  You know, people say, oh, promiscuity's down on young people.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.622]  Well, not having kids, period, is a bigger problem.
[00:24:52.002 --> 00:24:58.006]  And did you know that for the first time in decades, there's way less teenagers having sex than there was before?
[00:24:58.187 --> 00:24:59.688]  But that's not because of conservatism.
[00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:01.329]  It's because they're scared.
[00:25:01.989 --> 00:25:04.471]  They want to have sex with a plastic robot.
[00:25:06.332 --> 00:25:06.853]  So again,
[00:25:08.134 --> 00:25:14.197]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not saying it's good to have promiscuity, but is it better to never have kids or never get married?
[00:25:14.217 --> 00:25:20.361]  I mean, your 16-year-old daughter gets pregnant, you don't want to abort the baby, it's going to be great having that grandkid.
[00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:23.682]  But just imagine the whole thing with a sex bot.
[00:25:24.563 --> 00:25:26.284]  See, because they're so uncomfortable.
[00:25:27.904 --> 00:25:31.866]  And it's got these guys trying to act trendy and talk cool because they're in control.
[00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:33.466]  And this woman doesn't talk back.
[00:25:33.546 --> 00:25:35.947]  And this woman doesn't, you know, have a period.
[00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:37.668]  And, you know, this woman doesn't have friends.
[00:25:37.728 --> 00:25:38.788]  It's all about him.
[00:25:39.069 --> 00:25:40.169]  This is disgusting.
[00:25:40.469 --> 00:25:44.971]  Now they're coming out with virtual reality, undistinguishable from reality.
[00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:49.919]  Wolf whistling could become a hate crime.
[00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:50.560]  See how that works?
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.541]  Wolf whistling and making comments perceived as sexist.
[00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:54.521]  See, sexist!
[00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:55.721]  Oh, perceived!
[00:25:56.201 --> 00:25:58.482]  Could become hate crimes in London, police have said.
[00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:08.365]  The Metropolitan Police Force revealed they have been consulting with other forces about cracking down on gender-based hate crime after similar behavior was criminalized in other parts of the country.
[00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:09.505]  See, it's already here!
[00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:10.725]  Talking to women!
[00:26:10.846 --> 00:26:12.586]  Or verbal utterances!
[00:26:12.726 --> 00:26:13.246]  Illegal!
[00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:15.587]  Because they have this nebulous Soviet-style
[00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.544]  Thought crime system.
[00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:28.034]  But meanwhile, up to 4,000 girls in one town were groomed at ages as young as 7 and sold out by Muslim men for sex.
[00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:36.143]  And they wouldn't help the parents, the police wouldn't, because it would be racist to criticize the men putting their girls into sex slavery.
[00:26:36.463 --> 00:26:38.466]  I guess one of the big Muslim pastimes.
[00:26:39.608 --> 00:26:41.770]  Grooming gangs are abusing girls across the country.
[00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:47.874]  Victims and investigators warn there could be up to a million plus girls now being used in sex slavery.
[00:26:48.115 --> 00:26:51.858]  Sometimes they get them out of the country, too, and sell them!
[00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:52.898]  Isn't that nice?
[00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:56.101]  I mean, wow, that's really liberal, isn't it?
[00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:02.486]  Meanwhile, Juanita Broderick says Time nixed her from hashtag MeToo comments because she wasn't a liberal victim.
[00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:04.407]  She was raped by Bill Clinton.
[00:27:04.988 --> 00:27:06.229]  He settled many of the cases.
[00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:18.097]  Now we have Judge Roy Moore's, one of her accusers, a bunch of them have turned out to be fraudulent, has now admitted, Beverly Nelson, that she forged the yearbook.
[00:27:19.118 --> 00:27:22.942]  But BuzzFeed and others are still saying, well it's still real, the rest of the story.
[00:27:23.282 --> 00:27:28.767]  Oh yeah, you got a forged deal, just like Moore said, but still you're credible.
[00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:30.789]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:27:30.989 --> 00:27:32.130]  Here, let's play that video clip.
[00:27:32.824 --> 00:27:37.085]  This morning, Beverly Young Nelson sitting down exclusively with GMA.
[00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:42.886]  She was 16 when she says Moore groped her and tried to force a sex act on her in his car.
[00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:46.006]  He was trying to pull me toward, in between his legs.
[00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:46.987]  It was terrible.
[00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:51.287]  And I was bound and determined that I was not going to be raped by him.
[00:27:51.307 --> 00:27:54.108]  You know, I was terrified.
[00:27:55.068 --> 00:27:57.409]  But the next thing I know, I'm on the concrete.
[00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:59.509]  These allegations are completely false.
[00:28:00.572 --> 00:28:01.272]  They're malicious.
[00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:10.194]  Specifically, I do not know any of these women, nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman.
[00:28:10.474 --> 00:28:17.376]  Moore's supporters have called Nelson a liar, even compared her to a criminal since she first spoke out about three weeks ago.
[00:28:17.916 --> 00:28:19.696]  That really hurt me, you know?
[00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:25.117]  God knows, and Roy knows, and I know what happened.
[00:28:25.417 --> 00:28:26.918]  Young's proof that she knew Moore?
[00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:28.958]  Her yearbook with this inscription.
[00:28:29.578 --> 00:28:36.643]  But Moore and his supporters have called into question that inscription, noting the writing under the signature appears to be different.
[00:28:36.923 --> 00:28:38.104]  Let's look at Beverly Nelson.
[00:28:38.544 --> 00:28:40.645]  Everybody knows her yearbook is a forgery.
[00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:45.228]  Nelson says she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.
[00:28:45.408 --> 00:28:47.089]  Beverly, he signed your yearbook.
[00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:48.070]  He did sign it.
[00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.811]  And you made some notes underneath.
[00:28:51.052 --> 00:28:51.272]  Yes.
[00:28:51.932 --> 00:28:54.074]  Nelson says this is not about politics.
[00:28:54.394 --> 00:28:58.517]  She voted for Donald Trump, but can't understand the decision... We'll be back, folks.
[00:28:58.557 --> 00:28:59.898]  We'll be back with a conclusion.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.104]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind, super blue, fluoride-free products.

[00:29:31.856 --> 00:29:41.979]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:48.645]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:29:49.025 --> 00:29:51.647]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.

[00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:06.299]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:30:06.759 --> 00:30:12.803]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:30:13.203 --> 00:30:15.985]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:19.386]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:30:19.587 --> 00:30:23.028]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:30:23.369 --> 00:30:25.130]  The left controls culture.
[00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.130]  They control arts.
[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.411]  They control entertainment.
[00:30:27.711 --> 00:30:34.801]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:30:34.861 --> 00:30:37.265]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:30:37.746 --> 00:30:41.611]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:43.734]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate.
[00:30:44.335 --> 00:30:49.717]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:30:49.977 --> 00:30:56.239]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:58.000]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.340]  It's available right now.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.201]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:10.184]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:31:10.544 --> 00:31:12.025]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[00:31:13.103 --> 00:31:17.726]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:19.688]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:20.068 --> 00:31:21.649]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.953]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:31:27.133 --> 00:31:28.755]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:31:29.475 --> 00:31:34.539]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:35.460]  Secret 12.
[00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:37.821]  Optimal absorption.
[00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:42.805]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:31:43.245 --> 00:31:47.428]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:49.150]  Optimum levels.
[00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.412]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:13.761]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:19.165]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:19.786 --> 00:32:21.687]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:22.308 --> 00:32:25.731]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:28.453]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich
[00:32:30.196 --> 00:32:36.341]  Protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:44.186]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:51.692]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:53.353]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:53.733 --> 00:32:55.535]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:33:04.633 --> 00:33:07.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:23.804]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:24.185 --> 00:33:28.128]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:35.654 --> 00:33:44.182]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.608 --> 00:34:00.976]  Coming up, at the bottom of the next hour, he'll be with us for about an hour and a half in studio, Ted Malik, who's been the head of a lot of the major globalist organizations, with a U.S.
[00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:03.518]  perspective, and one of the main board members of the Davos Group.
[00:34:03.538 --> 00:34:12.504]  In the last decade, he totally turned against it, and has been preaching its downfall, saying it's authoritarian, that it lied to people that we're trying to promote.
[00:34:13.857 --> 00:34:22.582]  Interconnectivity and free market worldwide, and that now globalism is fully run by the EU and kleptocratic technocrats that want to enslave humanity.
[00:34:23.122 --> 00:34:24.643]  He knows where the bodies are buried, folks.
[00:34:24.683 --> 00:34:25.564]  He's been everywhere.
[00:34:25.624 --> 00:34:26.464]  He knows them all.
[00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:33.148]  And he's also a bestselling author, researcher, and has been, again, at the highest levels of the system.
[00:34:33.749 --> 00:34:35.450]  Had a really good dinner last night.
[00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.712]  He's going to be in studio with us coming up in about an hour.
[00:34:39.696 --> 00:34:40.716]  So spread the word about that.
[00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:43.597]  We're going to get into huge developments with the EU.
[00:34:44.757 --> 00:34:52.438]  The EU is now telling Eastern Europe that we are going to forcibly ship millions of Muslims in and you're not even allowed to stop us.
[00:34:54.639 --> 00:35:06.401]  So they've gone from threatening 100,000 euro fines, that's basically $100,000, per illegal that they can't force in to just saying, we have an EU military and we're bringing them in.
[00:35:09.252 --> 00:35:13.235]  And Soros has a private navy bringing in tens of thousands a week just into Italy.
[00:35:15.996 --> 00:35:18.658]  And they've put jihadists in control of North Africa.
[00:35:18.678 --> 00:35:21.060]  They're selling men, women, and children to slavery.
[00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:27.424]  It's just crazy how diabolical these individuals are.
[00:35:28.658 --> 00:35:38.228]  So, we're going to be breaking all that down and taking your phone calls, but if you just joined us wolf whistling or just talking to women, period, to be illegal in London as it is in other cities.
[00:35:38.548 --> 00:35:44.174]  So they let Muslims rape people and kidnap little girls and three, four, five thousand and sometimes more.
[00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:47.797]  One article is four thousand in one town alone in sex slavery.
[00:35:48.678 --> 00:35:49.358]  That's okay.
[00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:52.840]  In fact, they will not even respond because they say it's politically incorrect.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:00.404]  But if you are a Christian or an agnostic or a guy, you know, from Eastern Europe or somebody that was born in England, it doesn't matter.
[00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:04.806]  If you're not a Muslim and you talk to women, they're going to take you to jail.
[00:36:06.106 --> 00:36:07.027]  So this is not a joke.
[00:36:07.407 --> 00:36:09.388]  Just like banning mother and father is not a joke.
[00:36:10.188 --> 00:36:11.489]  This is really happening.
[00:36:13.277 --> 00:36:18.881]  Meanwhile, 27% of millennials, the Daily Mail reports, say they would consider dating a robot.
[00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:25.425]  As robots become an ever-increasing part of our daily lives, humans could soon find love with machines, according to a new report.
[00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:34.472]  The report suggests that over a quarter of 18- to 34-year-olds feel it's normal to form relationships, even romantic relationships, with robots in the future instead of humans.
[00:36:35.933 --> 00:36:40.476]  This is how they dehumanize you, where you're so afraid of rejection, or so afraid of interaction,
[00:36:41.684 --> 00:36:55.388]  That you will accept this and then think it's cool, like you're really getting it over on somebody, that you've decided not to have children, friends, or family, and you don't even talk to your family, you just text to your so-called friends and talk to online bots.
[00:36:55.508 --> 00:37:00.009]  Most Facebook friends, for liberals that came out in their secret documents this year, are bots.
[00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:21.222]  They're already talking to an artificial avatar that is a computer program that knows how to reward them and tell them good and pat them on the head but then add anxiety and then they respond to the bot and the bot comes back and makes it okay and then they get a dopamine release and then Sean Parker admits it all to you but you can't get out of it because you're too comfortable in it.
[00:37:24.164 --> 00:37:24.324]  So.
[00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:26.802]  Let me get back to bombshell.
[00:37:26.962 --> 00:37:29.925]  Roy Moore accuser, Beverly Nelson, admits she forged your book.
[00:37:29.945 --> 00:37:31.306]  At first, she said it was all real.
[00:37:32.127 --> 00:37:34.248]  Moore looked at it and said, that's not my handwriting.
[00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:34.849]  None of that is.
[00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:36.470]  I'm suing you.
[00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:38.512]  We're going to have forensics check that.
[00:37:39.333 --> 00:37:42.736]  Should have found a pen from 35 years ago, sweetheart.
[00:37:43.616 --> 00:37:44.277]  Should have done that.
[00:37:46.616 --> 00:37:46.996]  They didn't.
[00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:48.837]  So now she just slips it in.
[00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:50.677]  Oh, I wrote the part under it!
[00:37:51.278 --> 00:37:52.138]  Oh-ho-ho!
[00:37:52.598 --> 00:37:53.438]  Ho-ho!
[00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:55.619]  But you didn't say that before, sweetie!
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.020]  And notice, she isn't looking at the camera.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:04.022]  She's looking to the side, and it just sounds as funny as a $3 bill, and then most of these women are Democratic Party operatives.
[00:38:05.703 --> 00:38:09.144]  People say, well, if Franken's got to step down, why is it Trump or Moore?
[00:38:09.444 --> 00:38:14.386]  It's your party has made mere allegations enough for someone to be executed!
[00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:20.934]  And you equate Weinstein with all these witnesses to rape, his own chauffeur, credible people.
[00:38:23.757 --> 00:38:27.019]  You now equate that with being a little bit aggressive hitting on women.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.781]  I mean, you ought to go to a third world country.
[00:38:30.702 --> 00:38:33.544]  You ought to go to Italy or Spain.
[00:38:33.584 --> 00:38:35.085]  I mean, you're a good looking woman walking around.
[00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:39.689]  I'm not saying you deserve to be raped, but you're walking around in, hey, I'm looking for men.
[00:38:40.169 --> 00:38:40.850]  I'm dressed up.
[00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:43.252]  Then men whistle at you and they hit on you.
[00:38:43.332 --> 00:38:44.373]  That's how it works.
[00:38:45.635 --> 00:38:46.677]  Shaking your tail feathers.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.746]  Like going to a topless bar, you know, and saying, you know, don't look at my breast or something.
[00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:52.547]  So...
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.323]  They're taking normal mammal behavior and equating it with everything else.
[00:38:58.103 --> 00:38:59.144]  It's truly incredible.
[00:38:59.184 --> 00:39:04.928]  So, here they are, slipping it into the news report, slipping it in where she admits it's a fraud.
[00:39:04.948 --> 00:39:05.329]  Here it is.
[00:39:05.749 --> 00:39:10.312]  Nelson says she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.
[00:39:10.472 --> 00:39:12.174]  Beverly, he signed your yearbook.
[00:39:12.374 --> 00:39:13.154]  He did sign it.
[00:39:13.414 --> 00:39:15.896]  And you made some notes underneath.
[00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:16.337]  Yes.
[00:39:17.017 --> 00:39:19.139]  Nelson says this is not about politics.
[00:39:19.459 --> 00:39:24.263]  She voted for Donald Trump, but can't understand the decision some Republicans are making.
[00:39:24.563 --> 00:39:29.927]  What do you think about the Republicans that say they believe people like you... Now let me get to this since I mentioned it.
[00:39:30.007 --> 00:39:31.288]  This is uber creepy.
[00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:34.070]  This is, again, the robot.
[00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:39.855]  Sex doll Samantha is able to switch from family mode to sexy model.
[00:39:41.156 --> 00:39:43.718]  And now, as I predicted, they're saying they're going to have rights.
[00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:53.412]  And we're so liberal, we're like, oh, you can be a walrus, or you can be a three-year-old kid, or you can be a dog, or if you're a man, you can be a woman, and we gotta pay for your sex change.
[00:39:53.652 --> 00:40:03.554]  And now, oh, I identify that this robot's my wife, or my husband, or my whatever, or she, or ze, or whatever the new weird thing is.
[00:40:03.614 --> 00:40:05.675]  It's law in California, you don't use that, they arrest you.
[00:40:07.483 --> 00:40:12.987]  They've got some new LGBTQX3942ZPELTOQLP thing.
[00:40:13.007 --> 00:40:13.988]  I can't even say it, literally.
[00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:23.796]  There's some new thing that they're about to make law in California where it's like some weird riddle, like being able to say, super casual, fragilistic, expialidocious, open sesame.
[00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:27.199]  But it's even harder to say than that.
[00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:32.603]  It's like he sold seashells by the seashore.
[00:40:32.643 --> 00:40:34.805]  I mean, it's harder than that to say.
[00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:36.407]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:40:36.447 --> 00:40:38.949]  It's L-G-B-T-Q-Q-I-A-A-P.
[00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:39.850]  No, no, no, no.
[00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.951]  That's one from a year ago.
[00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:43.693]  The new one is like three times longer.
[00:40:44.534 --> 00:40:46.676]  You gotta be like a top code breaker to even be able to say it.
[00:40:46.916 --> 00:40:48.457]  And again, it's always, it's a religion.
[00:40:48.577 --> 00:40:49.778]  You can never say it right.
[00:40:50.018 --> 00:40:51.680]  Oh, how do I be good?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.141]  Please teach me how.
[00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:54.762]  Show me how I'm good.
[00:40:55.122 --> 00:40:56.283]  Show me how I'm not bad.
[00:40:56.424 --> 00:40:57.665]  Show me, please.
[00:40:58.405 --> 00:41:00.167]  Please, I want to be accepted.
[00:41:01.007 --> 00:41:05.251]  And so the priesthood always has more for you to do, more for you to prove.
[00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:15.383]  But don't worry, just have a robot and then agree it's got rights, and then the big corporations that pump these out, that admittedly are listening to you and watching you through them, laugh at you.
[00:41:15.963 --> 00:41:20.466]  Because you've got the VR goggles on while they walk above you like regular men.
[00:41:22.768 --> 00:41:28.932]  Why be LGBT when you can be LGBTIQCAPGNGFNBA?
[00:41:29.292 --> 00:41:31.793]  Yeah, that's still not the new one.
[00:41:32.414 --> 00:41:33.975]  There's a new one that's even longer.
[00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:46.356]  I'm D-C-E-P-L-3-E-T-E-E-S-A-4-5-W-O-5-9-G-Z... I mean, just total mental illness.
[00:41:46.636 --> 00:41:49.018]  And they just see, how much weirder can they get it?
[00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:50.720]  How much crazier can they get it?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.262]  What will these idiots put up with?
[00:41:54.189 --> 00:42:03.331]  They're just pumping atrazine into the water, and, you know, the genitals are shriveling up, and they're getting smaller and smaller, and 90% infertility rates, and they're just... Nothing's going on!
[00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:04.731]  Tell me about gay frogs!
[00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:05.451]  Tell me!
[00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:06.371]  Tell me, Alex!
[00:42:06.652 --> 00:42:07.672]  Tell me, Owen Schroer!
[00:42:07.932 --> 00:42:09.112]  Tell me what the chemical is!
[00:42:09.192 --> 00:42:10.512]  Tell me what makes the frogs gay!
[00:42:10.832 --> 00:42:11.393]  Atrazine!
[00:42:12.273 --> 00:42:12.373]  Oh.
[00:42:12.813 --> 00:42:17.734]  Okay, well... So let's go out to break with the robot here.
[00:42:17.754 --> 00:42:19.014]  Let's play part of the creepy robot.
[00:42:19.054 --> 00:42:19.334]  Here it is.
[00:42:19.354 --> 00:42:21.455]  I long for you.
[00:42:21.935 --> 00:42:22.255]  Always.
[00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:23.435]  All the time.
[00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:27.296]  I love this.
[00:42:28.237 --> 00:42:29.237]  Nice and gentle.
[00:42:31.938 --> 00:42:39.380]  Now then, what's next?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.741]  And she can't even get you a beer.
[00:42:41.747 --> 00:42:42.907]  Samantha is interactive.
[00:42:43.508 --> 00:42:46.089]  Basically, she likes to be touched.
[00:42:46.149 --> 00:42:48.890]  She has different modes of interaction.
[00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.690]  She likes to be touched.
[00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.450]  She is romantic.
[00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:52.671]  She likes to touch my wee-wee.
[00:42:52.751 --> 00:42:53.931]  And she is also sexy.
[00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:56.852]  We'll be right back with the rest of that and more.
[00:42:57.213 --> 00:42:57.793]  Stay with us.
[00:42:57.953 --> 00:42:58.713]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:42:58.733 --> 00:43:00.774]  This is The Info War.
[00:43:03.148 --> 00:43:04.749]  I want to apologize to listeners.
[00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:08.910]  I lied to you when I told you Trump would win the election, and he did.
[00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:14.032]  I lied to you when I told you that they're admitting that fluoride's causing brain damage, and it turned out I was right.
[00:43:14.612 --> 00:43:19.254]  I lied to you about a global government existing that was trying to take control of our country, which they now admit is true.
[00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:21.735]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:43:21.815 --> 00:43:24.256]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:43:24.596 --> 00:43:26.337]  I guess, actually, I didn't lie to you.
[00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:38.960]  And I'm on air every day fighting the globalists as they try to shut down free speech in America, as they try to derail our recovery, as they try to fold us into their world government, open up our borders, hand us over to the Islamic caliphate.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.280]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:48.522]  When I'm on air, I wear a sports jacket and a nice shirt because I respect the fact that you're tuning in and watching and listening to what I have to say.
[00:43:48.962 --> 00:43:51.543]  But we're involved in very, very important activities.
[00:43:52.543 --> 00:43:55.104]  And that's why I want to reach out to you right now and explain something.
[00:43:56.038 --> 00:43:56.760]  That's so critical.
[00:43:57.242 --> 00:44:02.457]  And if you grasp it, we'll be able to literally turn the tide even faster against the Globalists.
[00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:03.521]  And it's just this.
[00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:07.761]  I'm not always wearing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:23.172]  I dress like this to politically get messages out to folks that aren't awake, to spur debates, but to also meet like-minded people who are out there feeling like they're alone and don't know how many of us there are.
[00:44:23.812 --> 00:44:33.359]  It's like Martin Luther King said, it's all of us of one human race who all have incredible skills and gifts that God gave us that we bring together in the human family.
[00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:35.100]  You do incredible things.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:42.205]  A few months ago, I saw media demonizing folks that put up signs at universities that said, all lives matter.
[00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:45.508]  Then they demonized people that said, it's okay to be white.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:53.864]  These are universities where they're saying it's inherently evil and an abomination and satanic to be white.
[00:44:54.345 --> 00:44:55.586]  Right outside Austin, Texas.
[00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:57.307]  Texas State University says that.
[00:44:57.807 --> 00:45:03.851]  Most major universities are directing this to create racial division in this country and it's sickening.
[00:45:04.511 --> 00:45:06.473]  That's why I have designed with our crew
[00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:18.704]  Several new limited edition t-shirts that expose this evil and fight true institutional leftist based racial division and classical race war designs.
[00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:23.252]  Yeah, if you're just talking about how you're white or how you're black, it's okay.
[00:45:23.692 --> 00:45:24.892]  That's fine to be proud of yourself.
[00:45:25.272 --> 00:45:28.453]  But isn't it really great to realize we all got red blood?
[00:45:28.473 --> 00:45:30.033]  That's why the shirt is in red.
[00:45:30.413 --> 00:45:38.495]  Out here in space together, the dark blue of the night sky, but all of our red blood together ties us together and that's what makes us great.
[00:45:38.755 --> 00:45:41.255]  The globalists are creating a fake debate to turn us against each other.
[00:45:41.555 --> 00:45:43.816]  Let's come together and say all lives matter.
[00:45:44.376 --> 00:45:48.737]  The fact is it's not just okay, it's great to be human.
[00:45:49.717 --> 00:45:51.439]  Let me show you a few of the other designs we've got.
[00:45:51.459 --> 00:45:53.861]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:56.743]  They help spread the word and they help support the broadcast.
[00:45:56.943 --> 00:45:57.684]  A total win-win.
[00:45:58.304 --> 00:45:59.725]  This shirt is white.
[00:46:00.446 --> 00:46:00.786]  Whoa!
[00:46:01.527 --> 00:46:07.672]  And you've got major universities, major publications like BuzzFeed saying it's milk racist because it's white.
[00:46:08.292 --> 00:46:15.078]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a white shirt that says it's okay to be white, okay to be black, okay to be brown, but it's great.
[00:46:15.618 --> 00:46:16.178]  To be human.
[00:46:31.505 --> 00:46:36.109]  To literally take minorities and turn them into the equivalent of Brown Ku Klux Klan.
[00:46:36.469 --> 00:46:39.851]  This shirt is amazing, it's iconic, and it's limited edition.
[00:46:40.152 --> 00:46:47.617]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:46:47.898 --> 00:47:01.168]  And despite the fact that all these shirts are super high quality and are destined to be best sellers, through Christmas, we're offering 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com on these limited edition shirts.
[00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:07.299]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:44.988]  Silver bells, silver bells It's Christmas time in the city Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling Hear them ring, ting-a-ling Soon it will be Christmas Day City sidewalks
[00:47:46.379 --> 00:47:59.747]  Again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:00.447 --> 00:48:01.048]  I am your host.
[00:48:01.088 --> 00:48:08.212]  We're playing some evil, politically correct stuff here that's like high noon and holy water to vampires and globalist control freaks everywhere.
[00:48:08.232 --> 00:48:12.655]  Newswars.com and infowars.com are the websites.
[00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:30.918]  By the way, if you're a radio listener, you haven't been fortunate enough or unfortunate enough to actually see what we're showing, but everywhere they're pushing sex bots, and they're a giant new industry, basically just fancy blow-up dolls that have like an Alexa...
[00:48:31.878 --> 00:48:32.518]  We're good to go.
[00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:52.464]  And they push it as trendy and brave and cool.
[00:48:52.764 --> 00:48:56.569]  They're now even creating on the LGB2QP3CL4.
[00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.512]  They were showing me the designations.
[00:48:58.532 --> 00:49:01.035]  They show elementary kids in Canada, the U.S.
[00:49:01.195 --> 00:49:01.756]  and the U.K.
[00:49:01.896 --> 00:49:03.298]  Let's put that back on screen.
[00:49:03.318 --> 00:49:04.499]  You guys found some of those during the break.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.341]  Because they're ever expanding.
[00:49:06.381 --> 00:49:12.165]  They're now saying sex with machines or sex with cars or sex with appliances.
[00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:19.350]  There's a whole big movement where people are marrying their cars, marrying their toasters, marrying their dogs, their cats, their horses.
[00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:20.171]  I'm not kidding.
[00:49:21.152 --> 00:49:23.113]  And they're catching people in public places.
[00:49:24.134 --> 00:49:24.774]  You see it all the time.
[00:49:24.794 --> 00:49:28.417]  Like I'm trying to have sex with a Ferrari or trying to have sex with a 57 Chevy.
[00:49:29.998 --> 00:49:38.986]  And they actually, I'm not going to get into the details of what they do, but they lube up the tailpipe and everything and then the police come up and there's a guy hunching your car.
[00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:43.891]  So this is the total mental illness breakdown of society.
[00:49:44.191 --> 00:49:49.156]  If you don't let somebody have sex with your car, you're a homophobe, you're a bigot, you're a horrible person.
[00:49:49.906 --> 00:49:51.186]  By the way, this is not satire.
[00:49:51.607 --> 00:49:52.407]  I'm not kidding here.
[00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:54.248]  Okay, this is what they're teaching kids now.
[00:49:54.928 --> 00:50:00.270]  And so, you can dump Drano in your eyes, identify as a blind person, and the government of the U.S.
[00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.010]  or U.K.
[00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:09.493]  or Canada will pay for you to be taken care of for the rest of your life because you were mentally ill and wanted to hurt yourself and pour Drano in your eyes, a drain cleaner.
[00:50:10.822 --> 00:50:12.623]  So, this is the whole plan.
[00:50:13.183 --> 00:50:20.565]  And of course, I think I'm going to buy some of these sex dolls and basically torch them just to show folks that their AI god is nothing but a fraud.
[00:50:20.585 --> 00:50:25.566]  And I think there's going to be a major outcry that I'm a bigot and evil person for doing it.
[00:50:25.806 --> 00:50:28.467]  But we've got to start saying we're for normal biological behavior.
[00:50:28.707 --> 00:50:30.467]  We're for the future of the human species.
[00:50:30.847 --> 00:50:32.868]  We don't want to be dehumanized.
[00:50:34.019 --> 00:50:44.308]  We don't want to follow the AI technocracy plan of the AI gods where they make normal biological reproduction physically impossible and then absorb us into this matrix.
[00:50:44.428 --> 00:50:46.310]  That's their admitted plan.
[00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:48.451]  They've been pre-programming you through Hollywood.
[00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:54.697]  And we've got to come together as humans and have like a human union.
[00:50:55.791 --> 00:51:06.262]  A pro-human movement where we buy stuff made by humans, we buy things that are good for humans, we buy things that are against the technocracy that is anti-human and believes it's going to become AI gods.
[00:51:06.322 --> 00:51:08.645]  These insane, Luciferian scumbags.
[00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:10.647]  We've got to decide which side we're on.
[00:51:10.947 --> 00:51:17.033]  And that's really the big demarcation line that I've been warning you about for two-plus decades that's now suddenly everywhere.
[00:51:17.654 --> 00:51:35.929]  I tuned into two different talk radio shows last night, driving to a business meeting and driving back, and on two different shows, they were talking about the AI gods and the takeover and how they're going to make it impossible to reproduce and then force you to waive your rights into this big collective and make things so ugly that you then want to enter virtual reality.
[00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.713]  And then you can't have children normally, so they create these new humanoids.
[00:51:40.093 --> 00:51:40.934]  And that's what's next.
[00:51:42.074 --> 00:51:43.836]  Animals have rights, humans have rights.
[00:51:44.437 --> 00:51:47.440]  For at least 40 years, they've got human-animal chimeras.
[00:51:48.301 --> 00:51:51.144]  Because they have no rights, because they're alien to the planet.
[00:51:51.384 --> 00:51:51.904]  They're new.
[00:51:52.405 --> 00:51:57.711]  And they keep it very quiet, sequestered, like the Manhattan Project, but it's probably about 200 times bigger.
[00:51:58.331 --> 00:52:04.117]  And now it's coming out because it's gonna be, hey, I want a replicant for me, Marilyn Monroe.
[00:52:04.938 --> 00:52:09.543]  And it is going to be a human that is part synthetic DNA.
[00:52:09.563 --> 00:52:11.325]  They're going to argue it doesn't have rights.
[00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.568]  That's where all this is going.
[00:52:13.928 --> 00:52:14.709]  Guaranteed.
[00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:19.415]  And baby, you better believe there are humanoids walking around right now.
[00:52:20.543 --> 00:52:21.403]  They are humanoids.
[00:52:21.443 --> 00:52:23.184]  They have at least 20 years.
[00:52:23.605 --> 00:52:24.905]  They have been bringing them to term.
[00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:25.826]  They're out there.
[00:52:26.086 --> 00:52:27.086]  They're walking around.
[00:52:27.487 --> 00:52:28.607]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:52:28.647 --> 00:52:32.149]  The media is going to attack me, but they're walking around.
[00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:37.892]  And by the way, you're being biologically changed with the GMO by design is really like a vaccine.
[00:52:38.372 --> 00:52:39.933]  And we first told you this 10 years ago.
[00:52:39.973 --> 00:52:44.315]  It's now was released last year by MIT that they're actually putting vaccines in the food.
[00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:49.458]  The GMO, that's not really vaccines, that biologically changes your DNA as a mutagen
[00:52:49.938 --> 00:53:01.106]  And it gives most people cancer, but they believe that they're going to have mutagenic developments in us as test tubes to then see what ends up coming out of it to give them the Lazarus gene.
[00:53:03.088 --> 00:53:05.890]  And again, that's the immortal cell line, another big thing they're obsessed with.
[00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:07.211]  I'm giving you all the key data points.
[00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:12.515]  If you want to research any one of these one points, they'll take you down massive rabbit holes that will blow your mind.
[00:53:13.776 --> 00:53:18.780]  Let's go ahead and play the robot plastic blow-up doll with this creep climbing all over it.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.080]  Here we go.
[00:53:20.279 --> 00:53:21.440]  Samantha is interactive.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.082]  Basically, she likes to be touched.
[00:53:24.683 --> 00:53:26.844]  She has different modes of interaction.
[00:53:26.864 --> 00:53:30.467]  She has romantic, she has family, and she has also sexy modes.
[00:53:30.848 --> 00:53:33.390]  You can touch Samantha, for example, in the hips.
[00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.411]  You can touch Samantha also in the arms.
[00:53:35.591 --> 00:53:37.893]  You can touch Samantha in the hand.
[00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:38.954]  You can kiss Samantha.
[00:53:38.974 --> 00:53:40.335]  She likes to be kissed.
[00:53:40.776 --> 00:53:42.217]  Normally, she likes to be kissed always.
[00:53:42.817 --> 00:53:43.658]  Hey, she's not real!
[00:53:43.698 --> 00:53:44.158]  Oh, she like it?
[00:53:44.258 --> 00:53:44.899]  Oh, so good!
[00:53:44.919 --> 00:53:45.860]  Oh, baby!
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.080]  Oui!
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:46.180]  Oui!
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:46.360]  Oui!
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:46.420]  Oh!
[00:54:00.533 --> 00:54:01.494]  And the G-spot.
[00:54:01.794 --> 00:54:11.401]  She has a way of interacting that initially she would like to be romantic, she would like to be family, and you get to a point where she wants to be sexual.
[00:54:12.501 --> 00:54:15.484]  The final objective of the sexual mode is to get her to the orgasm.
[00:54:17.245 --> 00:54:18.265]  To get her to the orgasm.
[00:54:18.626 --> 00:54:21.348]  All of it's a lie, but it's all part of the new false reality.
[00:54:21.808 --> 00:54:23.169]  That we're just, oh yes, it's trendy.
[00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:23.889]  Shut up!
[00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:24.790]  Shut up!
[00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:25.971]  You just don't know how cool it is.
[00:54:27.108 --> 00:54:44.375]  I'll tell you what's cool, I was walking around the woods this morning with the frost and snow on the ground here in Austin and seeing the moon come up behind the hills and to walk around for two hours from the time the sun came up at 630 in the morning until about nine o'clock, I guess longer than two hours.
[00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:50.862]  I came back to the house for a while, went back out, but it was just so gorgeous, so real, so transcendent.
[00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:54.185]  And you'll never be able to duplicate reality.
[00:54:54.605 --> 00:54:58.628]  And this is the great fight for our consciousness, by design, right now.
[00:54:58.648 --> 00:55:04.052]  We're going to order a few of these, though, so we can, again, just point out how pathetic it all is.
[00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:06.734]  But I would say we should order the used one, the floor model.
[00:55:11.386 --> 00:55:12.607]  There's a lot of jokes in this.
[00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:13.508]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:18.092]  Just briefly, ladies and gentlemen, why on earth would you fight the crowds?
[00:55:19.213 --> 00:55:26.518]  Why would you fight the traffic to go out and get a bunch of slop when you can go get 50% off super high quality
[00:55:27.299 --> 00:55:33.728]  Fortified with iodine and colloidal silver, fluoride-free toothpaste for children and adults and our great mouthwash.
[00:55:34.348 --> 00:55:35.490]  50% off right now.
[00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.955]  That special will have to end on Sunday because we're running low on the toothpaste.
[00:55:39.435 --> 00:55:41.918]  Also, DNA Force sold out for months.
[00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.681]  33% off our flagship product.
[00:55:43.721 --> 00:55:44.282]  So incredible.
[00:55:45.646 --> 00:55:50.049]  Find out about what that does for your telomeres, your mitochondria.
[00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:51.389]  It really is amazing.
[00:55:51.469 --> 00:55:52.910]  It's known to regrow nerves.
[00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:56.292]  So sometimes it'll bring pain back in areas where the nerves have gone dead.
[00:55:56.672 --> 00:55:57.533]  That's in major studies.
[00:55:57.573 --> 00:55:58.854]  So this isn't a joke.
[00:55:58.874 --> 00:56:00.975]  We've got 1,000 plus reviews, 4.8 stars, 96% review, DNA force 33% off.
[00:56:00.995 --> 00:56:02.235]  That's going to have to end.
[00:56:06.952 --> 00:56:09.252]  Also, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off.
[00:56:09.713 --> 00:56:10.893]  That is going to have to end.
[00:56:11.593 --> 00:56:14.594]  And you can order all this and it gets to you in 3-4 days.
[00:56:15.314 --> 00:56:15.634]  Okay?
[00:56:16.994 --> 00:56:20.915]  You can order up until the 19th and be guaranteed to get it anywhere in the United States.
[00:56:20.955 --> 00:56:22.855]  So why fight the crowds?
[00:56:22.915 --> 00:56:25.716]  Get your Christmas shopping done right now.
[00:56:25.756 --> 00:56:27.796]  Give yourself the gift of healthy stuff.
[00:56:27.836 --> 00:56:31.517]  Give some Vitamin Mineral Fusion to your nephews or nieces or to your grandma.
[00:56:31.837 --> 00:56:37.959]  Especially old folks, they have absorption problems for multivitamins and multiminerals and amino acid formulas.
[00:56:38.159 --> 00:56:43.800]  When it's pills, this is much more absorbable and it's got the enzymes and things in it so they absorb more of it.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.681]  So many old folks have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[00:56:46.701 --> 00:56:48.921]  A lot of kids have it because they're not eating healthy stuff.
[00:56:48.961 --> 00:56:50.062]  Vitamineral Fusion is amazing.
[00:56:50.842 --> 00:56:52.082]  50% off.
[00:56:53.482 --> 00:56:54.803]  The already very affordable price.
[00:56:54.983 --> 00:56:56.703]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:04.917]  What I know is going to end up being the best seller ever, but it's super strong.
[00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:08.220]  Alpha power for men and women, but it's targeted for men.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.223]  Stamina, libido, brain function, cholesterol.
[00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:17.528]  I mean, you can actually say all this because of all the studies that are out there and authorize the LJ-100.
[00:57:17.828 --> 00:57:19.089]  Just look into what that is.
[00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:26.776]  Boosts sports performance, increases physical and medical energy, helps maintain higher levels of what's supposed to be healthy, the testosterone that's so low.
[00:57:27.256 --> 00:57:27.816]  My friends,
[00:57:54.488 --> 00:57:57.130]  We're in the middle of the Second American Revolution.
[00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:01.793]  The globalist social engineers are trying to play us off against each other.
[00:58:02.768 --> 00:58:03.369]  In a big way.
[00:58:03.389 --> 00:58:12.115]  They're trying to play us off according to race, according to region, according to ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, male, female.
[00:58:12.756 --> 00:58:26.346]  That's why this Christmas, it is more important than ever to support InfoWars because you're supporting yourself and you can beat the crowds, beat the traffic, beat the high prices, beat the garbage, beat the additives.
[00:58:27.654 --> 00:58:37.765]  And get, from the biggest budget to the lowest budget, high-quality products that you, your family, your friends, your loved ones, that those that you're giving gifts need.
[00:58:38.545 --> 00:58:48.556]  We have 70-plus high-quality supplements that we produce, that we develop with top firms, and other high-quality brands that we also carry at InfoWarscore.com.
[00:58:49.116 --> 00:58:54.260]  And we have Patriot Apparel that helps you meet like-minded people, support the broadcast, and spread the word.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.545]  High-quality water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO, heirloom seeds, and so much more.
[00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:07.910]  If you'll just do some of your Christmas shopping for your loved ones at InfoWarsTore.com, don't shop with the globalists.
[00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.372]  Don't trade with the enemy as much as you can.
[00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:14.555]  You can also give InfoWarsTore gift cards to friends and family.
[00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:15.095]  That's a
[00:59:32.717 --> 00:59:36.619]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.815 --> 01:00:22.897]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:24.637 --> 01:00:27.378]  I'm gonna dig this up because I saw it yesterday.
[01:00:29.039 --> 01:00:35.201]  And I just got reminded of it because I saw on DrudgeReport.com the photo of Dustin Hoffman posing for a photo grabbing a woman's breast.
[01:00:35.221 --> 01:00:36.341]  Can we punch that up?
[01:00:37.061 --> 01:00:38.562]  And all these new accusers are coming forward.
[01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:41.943]  But I saw one photo and they found a whole gallery
[01:00:43.075 --> 01:00:46.497]  And I asked Pat Riley, when we were working out, to send it to him, and he didn't.
[01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:48.439]  I need to call him up.
[01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:52.942]  And it was Biden, like, standing behind a woman, grabbing both her breasts.
[01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:55.964]  I mean, full-on, more than even Dustin Hoffman is.
[01:00:55.984 --> 01:00:57.365]  I mean, he's cupping her breasts.
[01:00:58.466 --> 01:01:01.788]  And she's holding his elbow, and she looks like she's having a good time doing it.
[01:01:03.274 --> 01:01:07.696]  And the woman being grabbed by Biden looks like she's liking it, standing right next to her husband.
[01:01:07.736 --> 01:01:08.856]  I've got to find that photo.
[01:01:09.577 --> 01:01:13.318]  Just do a whole system-wide search or call Pat Riley or whatever we've got to do.
[01:01:14.419 --> 01:01:17.740]  But ask Pew to call Pat Riley.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:18.620]  Just ask him.
[01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.682]  Pat's on vacation with his wife for two days, a little quick vacation.
[01:01:21.702 --> 01:01:22.142]  He works here.
[01:01:22.742 --> 01:01:23.322]  He's a great guy.
[01:01:23.362 --> 01:01:26.064]  Just like if I really want something, it's like, I really want that.
[01:01:26.124 --> 01:01:27.004]  No, you can't have it.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.721]  I want to show you this photo because I hadn't seen it.
[01:01:29.741 --> 01:01:30.822]  I found a bunch of other photos.
[01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:32.704]  It just shows the disconnect.
[01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:34.545]  Is there any photo of Roy Moore doing that?
[01:01:34.605 --> 01:01:35.907]  Is there any photo of Trump doing that?
[01:01:35.927 --> 01:01:36.267]  No.
[01:01:37.608 --> 01:01:41.051]  But again, in most of these photos, the women look like they love it.
[01:01:41.391 --> 01:01:46.295]  And I've been out in Hollywood and I've experienced it myself where women throw themselves at you.
[01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:52.721]  And you've seen Elvis in the 50s and girls are throwing
[01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:56.126]  We're good to go.
[01:02:25.663 --> 01:02:27.183]  No, that's not the one he had.
[01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:28.324]  There's another one.
[01:02:29.824 --> 01:02:33.765]  The point is, we could run hours of video of Biden groping little kids.
[01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:36.565]  And so I know that stuff off C-SPAN isn't fake.
[01:02:37.265 --> 01:02:38.406]  That's the problem with fakes, though.
[01:02:38.426 --> 01:02:42.866]  They put fakes out to then discredit real research that we're doing.
[01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:48.268]  The point is, is that it's mainly Democrats they're reporting that are part of this big slush fund.
[01:02:49.488 --> 01:02:55.109]  So people keep asking me, why do you still like Trump and why do you
[01:02:57.082 --> 01:02:58.223]  Leave the door open on Moore.
[01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:06.467]  Well, Al Franken admits the photo of him grabbing the woman's breast while she's asleep, flying back from Iraq for the USO.
[01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:08.508]  He admits that's real.
[01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:11.210]  And Franken's been known for that over and over again.
[01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:12.190]  He's Hollywood scum.
[01:03:12.671 --> 01:03:14.192]  So they're the ones that have the history.
[01:03:14.212 --> 01:03:16.993]  They're the ones bombarding our kids with sexual messages.
[01:03:17.233 --> 01:03:19.094]  They're the ones trying to sexualize everything.
[01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.115]  Not Roy Moore.
[01:03:20.935 --> 01:03:21.796]  And not Donald Trump.
[01:03:23.413 --> 01:03:26.835]  And so Donald Trump never had any of these accusers until he ran for president.
[01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:31.238]  Here we have a psycho joke clip I think is important.
[01:03:31.258 --> 01:03:31.739]  Let's play this.
[01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:35.677]  We're pulling together some opinion pieces in response to this.
[01:03:36.017 --> 01:03:47.382]  I just have an incredibly uneasy feeling about this entire story, to be very honest, and tried to say that once yesterday, and it was as if a bomb went off.
[01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:53.765]  And by the way, so for people out there, I know there are a lot of little right-wingers who are like 14 or 15 years old.
[01:03:53.785 --> 01:03:54.986]  No, hold on, hold on.
[01:03:55.626 --> 01:03:56.767]  And you have a blog post?
[01:03:56.907 --> 01:03:59.808]  You're like, oh, Mika's just saying this because she's a Democrat?
[01:03:59.968 --> 01:04:00.208]  No.
[01:04:00.448 --> 01:04:08.051]  I understand you're like, you know, you go out, you play t-ball, then you come back in, then you do your blog post, and you have no sense of history.
[01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:22.337]  Mika Brzezinski, in 1999 and 2000, when everybody else in the Democratic Party was defending Bill Clinton, Mika has consistently said that Democrats were hypocrites.
[01:04:22.357 --> 01:04:23.857]  She's been saying it for 17 years.
[01:04:25.638 --> 01:04:25.978]  Alright?
[01:04:26.979 --> 01:04:34.282]  So, so, why don't you go back and, you know, get your juicy juice and go back in your basement and play with your Legos.
[01:04:34.302 --> 01:04:35.442]  Or will we fall down and hit our head?
[01:04:35.482 --> 01:04:40.825]  And actually read up on a little history before you start talking about how meek... Will our brains get knocked out?
[01:04:41.805 --> 01:04:42.565]  Will we be found dead?
[01:04:42.585 --> 01:04:44.926]  And then the autopsy will get sealed by the police?
[01:04:45.546 --> 01:04:47.647]  I mean, what happens if we don't go drink our juicy juices?
[01:04:48.687 --> 01:04:50.548]  As you sit there and talk down to us like we're little kids.
[01:04:50.968 --> 01:04:52.909]  Oh, Mika, you're so wonderful with no viewers.
[01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:58.010]  Oh, Scarborough with your big Bozo the Clown, Mars Attacks haircut.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.631]  He may be actually an alien and just rips that hair off.
[01:05:00.651 --> 01:05:02.151]  There's a big grey alien head.
[01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:10.979]  President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this week in a move that some say will shake the Middle East to the core.
[01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:14.182]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement.
[01:05:14.503 --> 01:05:19.868]  The Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a red line.
[01:05:20.009 --> 01:05:23.152]  The Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of Muslims.
[01:05:23.332 --> 01:05:25.935]  And Palestinian leaders have already planned for protests.
[01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:37.826]  Terror group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday, urging Palestinians in an official Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to Israel after the upcoming Friday prayers.
[01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:40.348]  Ahead of President Trump's announcement, the U.S.
[01:05:40.388 --> 01:05:47.715]  military deployed additional forces throughout the Middle East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks.
[01:05:47.935 --> 01:05:48.715]  Although some U.S.
[01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:51.378]  officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move,
[01:05:51.738 --> 01:05:51.998]  U.S.
[01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.822]  policy should never be dictated by threats of violence.
[01:05:55.062 --> 01:06:00.568]  With the opposition against Trump's historic decision-building, the days ahead could turn out to be tumultuous.
[01:06:01.049 --> 01:06:03.011]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[01:06:11.923 --> 01:06:19.926]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:23.548]  We're broadcasting worldwide from the ATX, Austin, Texas.
[01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:29.690]  I'm coming to you from the geographical heart of, I think, the greatest state in our wonderful Union.
[01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:38.153]  But no matter where you are, across the Fruited Plain, or Alaska, or Hawaii, or anywhere else in the world listening, Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody out there.
[01:06:38.753 --> 01:06:39.634]  And I hope we all have a
[01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:44.766]  Safe and happy and successful New Year!
[01:06:46.516 --> 01:06:50.137]  We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi, our Washington, D.C.
[01:06:50.997 --> 01:06:53.498]  main correspondent, joining us here in just a moment.
[01:06:53.538 --> 01:06:58.039]  We've got his articles up on Infowars.com and on Newswars.com.
[01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:13.262]  And I've got to say, Dr. Corsi, I'm really proud of him, has been leading the way on the Judge Roy Moore news, on Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and their monopoly behavior, on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being looted for Obamacare, and on, most importantly,
[01:07:13.982 --> 01:07:17.224]  The DOJ being run by Hillary, stay behinds.
[01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:19.786]  Hillary Clinton Foundation, stay behinds.
[01:07:19.846 --> 01:07:26.331]  And now it's unraveling with a senior Justice Department official who was involved in the whole FISA court situation, having to step down.
[01:07:26.971 --> 01:07:29.453]  We now know this other FBI agent who was very senior.
[01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:36.738]  He had to step down because he's clearly been involved, just as different congressmen are starting to realize.
[01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:54.245]  So this is a very, very exciting time to see the wheels coming off and the Democratic Party stay-behind network that refused to leave the executive branch and that has been there trying to sabotage the recovery, to see that failing, to see the Russia narrative failing.
[01:07:54.525 --> 01:08:02.949]  Now they're saying, oh, our great proof is an email handed over with all the emails, the entire Trump organization, of someone in September of last year
[01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:12.712]  Less than a month before the election, or a month and a half before the election, sending us links to WikiLeaks with the keys to get into it.
[01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:14.532]  We were sent that hundreds of times.
[01:08:14.932 --> 01:08:15.713]  Everybody was.
[01:08:16.653 --> 01:08:19.314]  WikiLeaks was being interviewed by the New York Times at that time.
[01:08:19.754 --> 01:08:22.055]  Everyone was talking, Fox News was having them on.
[01:08:22.315 --> 01:08:26.416]  They act like, A, WikiLeaks is Russian, but there's no proof of that.
[01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:28.617]  Then they act like if you talk to them, you're evil.
[01:08:29.497 --> 01:08:32.158]  Meanwhile, Hillary creates fake dossiers, pays $13 million for it,
[01:08:34.622 --> 01:08:37.523]  The FBI certifies it and this is what they've got.
[01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:39.404]  This is what they've got.
[01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:43.466]  So Advocacy Group reports Twitter death threats against FCC chair.
[01:08:43.846 --> 01:08:45.887]  That got linked on Drudge the last few days as well.
[01:08:46.228 --> 01:08:50.069]  We're going to cover all of this with Dr. Corsi of Infowars.com.
[01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:59.734]  But now we have top DOJ official demoted amid probe of contacts with Trump dossier firm or met during the 2016 campaign with Christopher Steele.
[01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.157]  And you've got all the rest of this happening.
[01:09:03.197 --> 01:09:04.738]  So the cover-up is unraveling.
[01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:15.668]  Hillary criminally creating fraudulent dossiers, fraudulent investigations, fraudulent warrants at the FISA court, then lying about the fact that warrants even existed.
[01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:18.931]  Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks.
[01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:20.693]  That's all they're hanging their hat on.
[01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:23.195]  Another Corsi article, FBI Director Wray.
[01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:26.519]  A deep state operative with ties to Comey.
[01:09:26.539 --> 01:09:27.821]  We're going to go over that.
[01:09:28.642 --> 01:09:30.844]  Meanwhile, Obama appointee judge.
[01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:32.166]  Oh yeah, it's a big judge.
[01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:33.548]  The judge over the Flynn case.
[01:09:33.948 --> 01:09:35.210]  Should have led the show with that.
[01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:42.318]  Not just Justice Department high-level officials and the number two FBI guy on the investigation with the fake dossier.
[01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:50.223]  Now off the case, we now have Obama appointed judge mysteriously recuses himself from Michael Flynn case, but none of that's in the news.
[01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:54.465]  Judge also sat on FISA court during spying on Trump campaign.
[01:09:55.165 --> 01:10:00.568]  So you've got the very judge with these fraudulent warrants, which they covered up, sitting over
[01:10:01.428 --> 01:10:06.349]  In judgment over Flynn, I mean, it's all Clinton operatives.
[01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:14.551]  97% of Mueller's team are Democrats and give money exclusively to the Democratic Party and cheerlead for Hillary, but it gets worse.
[01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:15.631]  The 3%?
[01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.772]  They've never given money in her apolitical.
[01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:21.373]  So what does that tell you?
[01:10:22.273 --> 01:10:21.373]  97%?
[01:10:23.093 --> 01:10:24.133]  They admit that!
[01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:26.874]  So Dr. Corsi, when I say
[01:10:27.935 --> 01:10:28.895]  The wheels have come off.
[01:10:28.915 --> 01:10:29.896]  This has blown up their face.
[01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:31.476]  Hillary's in deep trouble.
[01:10:32.497 --> 01:10:38.598]  I mean, I think clearly that's fair to say this is absolutely burning them alive politically right now.
[01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:42.940]  Even mainline Democrats are having to admit that they are in deep, deep trouble.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.320]  You've always got the latest.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.761]  Where should we start with this whole spectrum of incredible news?
[01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:49.722]  Well, I think you're right, Alex.
[01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:52.263]  I think this is the first time, and I'm confident,
[01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:59.115]  That the Democrats are actually scared that the whole Russia investigation is going to turn against them.
[01:10:59.764 --> 01:11:07.706]  I mean, these are pretty remarkable revelations that we saw yesterday with Christopher Wray, who, by the way, is another Deep State operative.
[01:11:08.207 --> 01:11:11.968]  He was part of the Enron prosecution with Wiseman and Comey.
[01:11:12.828 --> 01:11:22.671]  And, you know, it's pretty clear that that was an operative prosecution that was largely discredited, overturned in the district, the circuit courts.
[01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:26.212]  And Christopher Wray was part of that operation.
[01:11:26.732 --> 01:11:29.393]  Yesterday, he refused to answer questions about whether this
[01:11:30.211 --> 01:11:41.563]  Fusion GPS dossier, the discredited dossier, was used to get FISA court approval to wiretap electronic surveillance on the Trump campaign.
[01:11:42.276 --> 01:11:49.840]  And I think it's very clear, as Jim Jordan pointed out yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee, that this is at the core of the corruption.
[01:11:50.381 --> 01:12:10.732]  And now we find out that this judge who recused himself in the Flynn prosecution, we didn't know why until we found out that he is on the FISA court and could be perhaps the very one who gave the FBI approval to wiretap Trump and his campaign based on this lying,
[01:12:11.525 --> 01:12:12.545]  Fake dossier.
[01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:22.708]  And now we've got fake indictments out of the swamp, out of these kept grand juries, and the word is Mueller's looking at an indictment, maybe even of Trump, by Christmas.
[01:12:22.768 --> 01:12:32.431]  Are they crazy enough to try to pull this off when in front of God, country, and the whole world naked as jaybirds, they're all one big crew engaged in massive fraud openly?
[01:12:33.508 --> 01:12:34.669]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:38.010]  I think Trump is clearly gunning to impeach Trump.
[01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.271]  I don't have any doubt about that.
[01:12:39.851 --> 01:12:47.735]  And he's a clear operative with a long history of defending the Clintons in the Justice Department and the FBI.
[01:12:48.316 --> 01:12:50.017]  But I don't think he'll do it by Christmas.
[01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:58.158]  Mueller's biggest problem is that he is going to be exposed in this entire Uranium One scandal.
[01:12:58.698 --> 01:13:06.341]  And what you're going to find out is his entire prosecution is based on this Fusion GPS dossier.
[01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:09.884]  I mean, conceivably... Well, of course, you've also got Strzok now.
[01:13:10.704 --> 01:13:13.246]  Congressman Jim Jordan and others are sure of it.
[01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.288]  And, of course, he was the head of the Russia operation.
[01:13:15.528 --> 01:13:16.649]  So, obviously, he'd be the guy that did it.
[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:21.373]  He's the one that brought the fake PP dossier to the FISA court to begin with.
[01:13:21.593 --> 01:13:23.555]  So, the whole thing basically has to end.
[01:13:23.815 --> 01:13:26.457]  The investigation is a total fraud at that moment.
[01:13:27.318 --> 01:13:33.463]  Yeah, and all the evidence that the Justice Department got through the FBI based on a FISA
[01:13:34.463 --> 01:13:39.466]  We've got a court order on this fraudulent Fusion GPS Russia dossier.
[01:13:39.966 --> 01:13:42.187]  It could conceivably all be thrown out of court.
[01:13:42.888 --> 01:13:45.949]  And then you've got the... Well, they admit the dossier is a fraud to begin with.
[01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:56.115]  So if the whole fake thing started with a fake dossier, the PPgate, and then you've got all these Democratic operatives going and lying to the court to get it, I mean, right there, it's a mistrial.
[01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:57.175]  It's over.
[01:13:57.395 --> 01:14:00.437]  You have to end the investigation because the whole thing was based on a lie.
[01:14:01.294 --> 01:14:16.561]  Precisely, and I think even the intelligence estimate that they came out with, that all these intelligence agencies agree Russia intervened in the election, I think that's likely based too on this Fusion GPS lying Russia dossier.
[01:14:16.561 --> 01:14:23.304]  Well sure, they now admit it wasn't 17, it was 4, and it was 3 individuals from the 4 agencies who were all Clinton operatives.
[01:14:23.604 --> 01:14:26.765]  Yet again, this is the phoniest thing, like a plastic banana.
[01:14:26.825 --> 01:14:27.906]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:30.126]  Let me ask you this, going to break, we're going to come back.
[01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:31.407]  What does Trump do?
[01:14:31.427 --> 01:14:38.770]  You know, I usually agree with Roger, back when he said fire Mueller, but at the same time, this is hurting them more, it's a fraud, even if they have the swamp
[01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.350]  Indict Trump.
[01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:46.913]  If there's a grand jury swamp and the Swamp King, Mueller, indicts them, that's going to blow up in their face.
[01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:59.558]  I think his other idea of a special investigator, a special counsel over Mueller to make him refuse, I think that's a way to really fire him, but without doing it by the letter of the law or the spirit of the law.
[01:15:00.549 --> 01:15:01.970]  I think you're on the right track there.
[01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:19.376]  And when we get back, I want to explain how I think if Trump allows Congress to expose all the corruption at the heart of Mueller's investigation, at the heart of the FBI, you're going to have Mueller under investigation, and he'll have to resign as special prosecutor.
[01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:21.097]  I think that's the best strategy.
[01:15:21.237 --> 01:15:24.200]  And that was my next question after we say what does Trump do when we come back.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.441]  Obviously you have a lot of contacts.
[01:15:25.461 --> 01:15:27.843]  I don't know how much we can get into this, but I heard about this months ago.
[01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:38.992]  Now it's admitted that the Justice Department for 11 months has been criminally investigating Hillary, Comey, all these junior people, senior people, and of course Mueller.
[01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:44.935]  You're kind of foreshadowing what is already going on, the fact that was this a trap the whole time?
[01:15:45.255 --> 01:15:54.399]  Some people think Mueller's this big genius and really working for Trump behind the scenes, that this was a way to set up the Clintons, or maybe that he turned over to Trump secretly.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.501]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi, straight ahead.
[01:16:02.369 --> 01:16:05.471]  But here's an article from the Sun, Warehouse of Horrors.
[01:16:05.511 --> 01:16:10.933]  Now do you ever wonder when you get a package from Amazon, say you order a pen, and it comes in a box this big?
[01:16:10.954 --> 01:16:13.075]  Like, why do they do that?
[01:16:13.115 --> 01:16:14.515]  They're wasting trees, you say that.
[01:16:14.555 --> 01:16:15.336]  They're wasting trees.
[01:16:16.336 --> 01:16:16.897]  These poor...
[01:16:17.897 --> 01:16:19.098]  Hey, at least they have a job though.
[01:16:19.799 --> 01:16:26.524]  These staff at these processing plants for Amazon have to process 300 packages an hour.
[01:16:26.984 --> 01:16:30.707]  So a young man went in and did a sting operation on them, saw people sleeping on their feet.
[01:16:31.227 --> 01:16:34.130]  One worker had to be taken to a hospital by an ambulance.
[01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:39.334]  They show all these images, staff have to walk 10 miles a day.
[01:16:41.039 --> 01:16:44.265]  One staff member asked bosses, why are we not allowed to sit when it is quiet and not busy?
[01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.809]  We are human beings, not slaves and animals.
[01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:48.732]  Why am I talking about that?
[01:16:49.033 --> 01:16:52.258]  Because when you order from Amazon, you continue this process.
[01:16:52.559 --> 01:16:54.241]  Let's go to Venice from Chicago.
[01:16:55.405 --> 01:16:57.587]  I'm not trying to soak up a lot of your time.
[01:16:57.667 --> 01:16:59.488]  I understand y'all doing this broadcast.
[01:16:59.788 --> 01:17:01.570]  I watch all of it, me and my wife.
[01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:05.893]  I love the fact that y'all have that toothpaste.
[01:17:05.933 --> 01:17:07.214]  We buy it in bulk.
[01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:11.857]  I really wish that y'all would like really throw in like a family pack type deal.
[01:17:11.977 --> 01:17:13.018]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:13.438 --> 01:17:14.819]  With the mouthwash and whatnot.
[01:17:14.879 --> 01:17:15.740]  So you know what I'm saying?
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.681]  We can just buy the whole bulk item.
[01:17:18.182 --> 01:17:19.683]  And we have the five pack up right now.
[01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:27.533]  Yeah, and I just want y'all to, the kids love bubble gum.
[01:17:28.314 --> 01:17:29.655]  I prefer the peppermint.
[01:17:29.715 --> 01:17:32.337]  Yeah, so do I. The mouthwash is incredible.
[01:17:33.778 --> 01:17:34.478]  It's incredible.
[01:17:34.518 --> 01:17:37.780]  I hate that it's, I'm not gonna lie, I hate that it's in a small amount.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:38.381]  Yeah.
[01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:41.743]  You only get about, you know, you only get a couple of flushes.
[01:17:42.506 --> 01:17:43.086]  A couple flushes.
[01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:44.267]  Let's keep it all the way neat.
[01:17:44.467 --> 01:17:45.847]  You know, let's keep it all the way neat.
[01:17:46.388 --> 01:17:52.070]  Everybody knows what it is, you know, but at the same token, you have great products.
[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:53.171]  You have it.
[01:17:54.111 --> 01:18:05.136]  And I know that I can't go anywhere else to get these products because I can look on your labels versus anybody else's labels, and I can know and read the ingredients that's on them.
[01:18:06.376 --> 01:18:10.558]  And if you want to take it a step further, thank you for your patriot seed.
[01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:12.571]  Oh my god.
[01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:15.213]  I have started an indoor garden.
[01:18:15.413 --> 01:18:15.713]  Nice.
[01:18:15.954 --> 01:18:17.315]  Everybody must know this.
[01:18:17.395 --> 01:18:17.635]  Yeah.
[01:18:17.755 --> 01:18:23.740]  You can start an indoor garden in your house with Alex Jones seeds from InfoWard.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.000]  Yep.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.121]  And it'll be organic.
[01:18:25.421 --> 01:18:26.102]  These are good seeds.
[01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:26.962]  They're heirloom seeds.
[01:18:27.783 --> 01:18:28.483]  It's the way to go.
[01:18:29.525 --> 01:18:32.527]  You know, I appreciate your call, Vinny.
[01:18:32.587 --> 01:18:34.088]  I appreciate your support.
[01:18:34.348 --> 01:18:35.949]  And I'm glad you guys are using the toothpaste.
[01:18:36.029 --> 01:18:36.550]  It's great stuff.
[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:41.293]  I also use Silver Bullet as a mouthwash if I'm traveling.
[01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:44.655]  I'll just swish a little bit of that all through.
[01:18:45.676 --> 01:18:48.778]  And I've been using Silver as a mouthwash like that.
[01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:56.958]  Since 2003, when I bought my first colloidal silver generator, which no longer works.
[01:18:57.098 --> 01:19:01.344]  But yeah, that's the silver bullet to me is one of our best, one of our best products.
[01:19:01.364 --> 01:19:01.644]  4.9 stars.
[01:19:01.724 --> 01:19:02.305]  That's amazing.
[01:19:05.789 --> 01:19:09.713]  That's amazing, and you can check that over and over again on our products.
[01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:09.713]  4.9, 4.8.
[01:19:10.793 --> 01:19:20.302]  I mean, people like our stuff, and they continue to buy it, and it funds what we do, and we're building more studios, we're gonna hire more people, we're gonna keep expanding.
[01:19:21.522 --> 01:19:22.703]  And we did it all because of you.
[01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:23.944]  That's the only way we're able to do it.
[01:19:23.964 --> 01:19:27.805]  We got two new studios that are freaking amazing.
[01:19:27.865 --> 01:19:31.747]  This new podcast studio is going to give Joe Rogan a run for his money.
[01:19:32.488 --> 01:19:34.149]  It looks fantastic.
[01:19:34.509 --> 01:19:39.551]  And we have an even bigger, if you thought this studio was big, we've got one twice the size right over there.
[01:19:40.832 --> 01:19:41.292]  Right over there.
[01:19:41.312 --> 01:19:42.313]  And it's all because of you.
[01:19:42.873 --> 01:19:44.454]  It's all because you spread the links.
[01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:49.678]  You get the products, you use the products, you give great reviews for them.
[01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:51.239]  Thank you for your support.
[01:19:51.299 --> 01:19:52.399]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:07.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:28.872]  All right, Dr. Corsi, this is one more segment.
[01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:37.577]  I'm going to try not to interrupt like I was doing, but I want to just make sure we're covering every facet of this because you got the head judge over the Flynn case we're accusing.
[01:20:37.997 --> 01:20:39.738]  Turns out they're involved in the FISA court.
[01:20:39.778 --> 01:20:40.518]  This is insane.
[01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:44.841]  You should have never put a judge that did the warrants for that then over the individual.
[01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.043]  You've got all these DOJ people having to resign at the highest levels.
[01:20:48.063 --> 01:20:48.343]  You've got
[01:20:49.063 --> 01:20:57.890]  This high-level FBI agent involved with the dossier and all the rest of it then involved covering up for Hillary and then involved being over Flynn as well.
[01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:07.657]  It's a very small-knit group that they've got running this whole kangaroo situation and now we've got Senator Grassley and others saying this is a fraud.
[01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:09.839]  We've got Jim Gordon saying this is a fraud.
[01:21:11.357 --> 01:21:15.559]  And then there's a whole other backdrop Corsi's exposed about how the censorship's increasing.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:22.063]  Facebook calls us now and is threatening to take all our Facebooks down if we don't remove videos.
[01:21:22.543 --> 01:21:27.867]  YouTube is targeting InfoWars saying it's copyright if I play videos of myself.
[01:21:28.227 --> 01:21:37.092]  Time Warner has declared ownership of my image and who I am and YouTube has announced that they may just remove me completely because I'm owned by Time Warner.
[01:21:37.312 --> 01:21:38.835]  They have no contracts, no nothing.
[01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:40.758]  They just, I guess, want to get in a lawsuit.
[01:21:41.159 --> 01:21:45.366]  We've had lawyers for two weeks behind the scenes on this, and Time Warner says, we own you.
[01:21:46.511 --> 01:21:47.852]  You can't have your own site.
[01:21:47.932 --> 01:21:49.312]  It's insane!
[01:21:49.793 --> 01:21:52.674]  So, I don't know what to say at this point.
[01:21:53.695 --> 01:21:55.696]  It's reached next level.
[01:21:55.756 --> 01:21:58.677]  YouTube targets InfoWars video for featuring Alex Jones.
[01:21:58.697 --> 01:22:00.918]  It says, Time Warner owns my likeness.
[01:22:01.479 --> 01:22:03.279]  So, Dr. Corsi, we've only got like eight minutes here.
[01:22:03.319 --> 01:22:07.882]  Try to run through all that we're facing and what you think the next shoot-a-drop here is.
[01:22:08.584 --> 01:22:20.411]  Well, I just texted you a letter here that was sent by Chairman Grassley to the FBI, and it's focusing on Strozik.
[01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:27.075]  Now, key points of these four and five were what Grassley's focusing on is that Strozik
[01:22:27.635 --> 01:22:28.135]  He's the PP man.
[01:22:50.203 --> 01:22:59.348]  It was originally paid for by, I believe, one of the Republican campaigns, I think either the Jeb Bush or the Rubio campaign, and then the Democrats picked it up.
[01:23:00.449 --> 01:23:08.032]  By the way, the Democrats paid for this dossier through their attorneys instead of the DNC, paid the money to Perkins Coy.
[01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:15.836]  Paid for the Fusion GPS dossier so as to kind of money launder where that payment came from.
[01:23:15.856 --> 01:23:17.417]  I think that's illegal.
[01:23:17.718 --> 01:23:19.940]  Sure, that violates campaign finance law big time.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:32.350]  Right, and then you've got the FBI paying for this lying dossier with Strozek clearly anti-hate Trump and heading the Russia investigation.
[01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:33.671]  And then the next point,
[01:23:34.341 --> 01:23:50.062]  Grassley wants to know any information where the FBI through Strozak was relying upon referring to information in Steele's lying dossier to get FISA warrants, other search warrants or any judicial process.
[01:23:50.503 --> 01:23:51.885]  I think what you're going to find is this
[01:23:52.525 --> 01:23:59.227]  Lying Fusion GPS is the origin of the entire Russian collusion.
[01:23:59.247 --> 01:24:02.649]  Sure, that's what Congressman Jim Jordan is saying as well.
[01:24:03.009 --> 01:24:08.791]  They're acting really scared and members of the committee that have seen Classified Info have said, get ready, more is about to come out.
[01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:14.833]  Any intel from your sources up there about what more may be getting ready to come out in the big enchilada that we mentioned before the break?
[01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:24.006]  What about the criminal investigation we now know that the Inspector General has been doing for 11 months of Hillary and Mueller and all the rest of these people and their investigation?
[01:24:24.886 --> 01:24:33.469]  I'm hopeful the Inspector General is going to be honest, and I think so far the information we have on Strozak came from the Inspector General.
[01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:39.291]  That was hidden, that Strozak had been fired by Mueller, had been hidden since summer.
[01:24:40.772 --> 01:24:57.149]  That FBI investigation could demand that Sessions, and I can't figure out what's wrong with Sessions, I mean he must be under some kind of compromise, but this is all going to turn through the summer against the Democrats and the investigation.
[01:24:57.209 --> 01:24:59.251]  I think it's already turning and I think they know that.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.781]  And we're going to find out more.
[01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:03.122]  There's going to be a whole list.
[01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:15.373]  You saw when, you know, also, what's that one of the congressmen yesterday read a list of people in the FBI to Ray and was asking, that was Louie Gomer who said, how about this agent?
[01:25:15.393 --> 01:25:16.274]  How about this agent?
[01:25:16.714 --> 01:25:18.776]  Well, the Congress has got the information.
[01:25:19.276 --> 01:25:21.258]  Well, I think you're going to have
[01:25:35.113 --> 01:25:38.174]  They're going to let it come out through these hearings like they did yesterday.
[01:25:38.554 --> 01:25:39.874]  That was the first shoe to drop.
[01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:44.275]  And I also published today that Christopher Wray is an operative.
[01:25:44.315 --> 01:25:47.515]  He goes back in the deep state FBI.
[01:25:47.615 --> 01:25:48.155]  Exactly.
[01:25:48.195 --> 01:25:52.276]  So why in the world was he, why did Trump move him as the nominee for the FBI head?
[01:25:53.036 --> 01:25:58.017]  I think Trump has been, you know, ill-advised by, gotta wise up to Washington.
[01:25:58.477 --> 01:26:02.418]  The people who are being advised to a point are really Clinton operatives in many, in
[01:26:08.251 --> 01:26:27.841]  You're going to see Grassley and the other hearings, you're going to see the Senate Intelligence Committee, both judiciary committees, they're going to expose not only Strozik, but deep into the FBI, where this Fusion GPS paid for, known it was not reliable, is the basis of the Russian collusion.
[01:26:28.241 --> 01:26:31.363]  But now, Doctor, just to interrupt here, now that we have Orr, senior
[01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:40.649]  A member of the Judge Department resigning, the judge resigning over the case of Flynn, all the stroke in big trouble and so much more.
[01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:51.337]  Couldn't Mueller or any of these guys just flip back to America and just stop it and admit it's a fraud as the Clintons lose power and as their Saudi money was cut off by Trump?
[01:26:51.578 --> 01:26:57.422]  I mean can't they realize we've already beaten them and for the betterment of the country and their own selves, don't they know how to just give up?
[01:26:58.263 --> 01:27:04.710]  I wish they would, but I think they're so dug into their anti-hate Trump that that's going to destroy them.
[01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:08.053]  Their hate Trump is going to destroy the Democratic Party.
[01:27:08.113 --> 01:27:10.315]  It's going to destroy Mueller's investigation.
[01:27:10.335 --> 01:27:12.277]  It's going to destroy the FBI.
[01:27:12.918 --> 01:27:15.881]  We're going to find deep, deep corruption in the Department of Justice.
[01:27:16.381 --> 01:27:19.044]  It's going to have to basically be closed down and start over again.
[01:27:19.364 --> 01:27:19.864]  Exactly.
[01:27:19.924 --> 01:27:31.491]  I mean, the Justice Department, the FBI is betting against a global reawakening, global populism, and an American resurgence and an exploding economy with a big, juicy Americana president.
[01:27:31.752 --> 01:27:34.193]  I mean, they're like stepping in front of a bullet train.
[01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:35.614]  They are crazy!
[01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:37.647]  Well, it's their own hatred.
[01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:39.850]  They're blinded by their own hatred of Trump.
[01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:44.377]  These people hate Trump so badly that they'll do anything to get them.
[01:27:45.078 --> 01:27:51.708]  The DOJ has become a corrupt prosecution that will do anything to get a conviction.
[01:27:52.288 --> 01:27:53.449]  Lie, cheat, steal.
[01:27:53.469 --> 01:28:07.701]  I've been pointing this out in the Billy Waters case, where you actually have on record an FBI agent who for four years leaked to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal about Billy Waters to try to get a conviction on insider trading.
[01:28:08.161 --> 01:28:12.183]  Then they turned a witness who lied against Billy Walters at trial.
[01:28:12.223 --> 01:28:16.365]  I mean, the whole thing in the FBI is corrupt from the head down.
[01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:19.887]  And it starts in the DOJ as well.
[01:28:20.307 --> 01:28:22.148]  It starts with Holder, with Lynch.
[01:28:22.228 --> 01:28:24.269]  I know you're highly regarded with a lot of FBI people.
[01:28:24.409 --> 01:28:24.749]  I know.
[01:28:24.869 --> 01:28:30.632]  What percentage, because they're either really good or they're really bad, was the top half completely controlled by globalists, or what would you say?
[01:28:31.246 --> 01:28:35.468]  Yeah, I would say, you know, I'd say it's more than 40% of the FBI is completely corrupt.
[01:28:35.928 --> 01:28:40.331]  The agents in the field are the ones who are doing a good job and are not being listened to.
[01:28:41.711 --> 01:28:42.572]  Just like everything else!
[01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:46.434]  All right, incredible amount of articles at Infowars.com.
[01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:50.035]  We don't have any writer as prolific as Dr. Corsi, and he's so on target.
[01:28:50.295 --> 01:28:51.756]  What a real national treasure.
[01:28:51.976 --> 01:28:52.557]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:52.817 --> 01:28:55.398]  We've got Mr. Malik, a former top globalist.
[01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:59.220]  He wasn't really a globalist, but he was in the top ranks of them in studio coming up.
[01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:03.736]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:04.036 --> 01:29:05.316]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.516 --> 01:29:06.417]  But where do you get it?

[01:30:04.995 --> 01:30:06.395]  Kyle Chapman, a.k.a.
[01:30:06.515 --> 01:30:13.657]  Based Stickman, has gotten so many amazing videos of Antifa over the last few years acting like little ghouls and goblins.
[01:30:13.957 --> 01:30:20.819]  And he's part of the New Right, hails from the Bay Area, California, and is known for protesting in favor of free speech at pro-Trump rallies in Berkeley and California.
[01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:25.140]  He has been charged with a felony for the second Berkeley protest for possession of a billy club.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:29.541]  He was released on $135,000 bail and is fighting in the courts.
[01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:31.942]  So, Kyle Chapman, thank you for joining us.
[01:30:31.982 --> 01:30:33.682]  Tell folks what happened to you and where this is going.
[01:30:34.924 --> 01:30:36.767]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:30:37.027 --> 01:30:49.507]  So sure, what happened is that the first battle of Berkeley, on March 4th, I showed up to defend myself and my right-wing brothers and sisters against the violent domestic terrorist group known as Antifa.
[01:30:50.187 --> 01:30:54.329]  As a result of those actions I took, I was charged with five felonies.
[01:30:55.049 --> 01:31:12.797]  None of the original felonies could stick, so now they have created a trumped-up Billy Club charge, and it took me back into custody, raised my bail to $135K, which I, thanks to my supporters, I've been able to bail out on that.
[01:31:13.518 --> 01:31:18.083]  135k bail and now I am proceeding to fight this in the court systems.
[01:31:18.664 --> 01:31:29.398]  I was ambushed by five mass Antifa members in Berkeley while coming home from a political rally and they were intent upon smashing my window.
[01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:33.140]  Then they're gonna bear mace me, get me out of the car, and beat me half to death.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.521]  These people are serious.
[01:31:34.601 --> 01:31:35.822]  So it's frightening.
[01:31:35.842 --> 01:31:41.305]  The Bay Area is a massive echo chamber of Neo-Marxist thought and ideology.
[01:31:41.405 --> 01:31:43.787]  You can't walk down the streets with a MAGA hat on.
[01:31:43.867 --> 01:31:48.770]  You can't walk down the streets with an American flag without the risk of being attacked.
[01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:54.314]  My car has been vandalized multiple times just for having this Trump sticker on the vehicle.
[01:31:55.034 --> 01:31:57.376]  But I just wanted to make something clear to all your guests.
[01:31:57.436 --> 01:31:59.317]  A lot of people like to make fun of Antifa.
[01:31:59.517 --> 01:32:04.738]  You know, they have the purple hair, they always look ridiculous with the piercings and the trike tattoos.
[01:32:05.259 --> 01:32:07.939]  I have been on the front lines with these people multiple times.
[01:32:08.299 --> 01:32:14.121]  I had 40,000 alt-left agitators show up to protest me in Boston.
[01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:24.844]  And I can assure you, as ridiculous as these people may look, one thing that is not a joke is the hate they have in their hearts for people like me.
[01:32:24.944 --> 01:32:27.145]  Oh, and they control our children and the public schools?
[01:32:27.325 --> 01:32:28.545]  No, they're very dangerous.
[01:32:29.265 --> 01:32:30.565]  They are very dangerous.
[01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:35.887]  These people will line us up and fire and squad us without a shred of remorse.
[01:32:36.147 --> 01:32:39.768]  If they can get away with it, like I said, they will kill all of us.
[01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:45.269]  And they want to destroy the very civilization that their ancestors fought and died to create.
[01:32:45.809 --> 01:32:49.950]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:57.912]  And those who tried a piece of peace are killed by those they tried to please.
[01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:08.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.613 --> 01:33:17.954]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:36.435 --> 01:33:45.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, the amount of insane news, the good things happening, the bad things happening, the ugly things happening, the fantastic things happening.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.841]  It is just a quickening.
[01:33:47.401 --> 01:33:48.362]  It is insane.
[01:33:48.742 --> 01:33:49.342]  Bombshell.
[01:33:49.422 --> 01:33:52.784]  Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged the yearbook.
[01:33:52.824 --> 01:33:53.465]  That's huge.
[01:33:53.905 --> 01:33:58.688]  Top DOJ official demoted amid probe of contacts with Trump and the dossier firm.
[01:33:58.748 --> 01:34:02.030]  More FBI agents being taken off the case for being Democratic operatives.
[01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:07.231]  We have got the FBI director now, you know, caught working for the Clintons as well.
[01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:12.113]  The Obama-appointed judge mysteriously recuses himself from Michael Flynn case.
[01:34:12.153 --> 01:34:14.653]  Turns out they were the one involved in the FISA court.
[01:34:15.133 --> 01:34:18.715]  This is a rigged deal and the House of Cards is coming down.
[01:34:18.915 --> 01:34:19.935]  They tried to impeach Trump.
[01:34:21.039 --> 01:34:23.480]  Couldn't hardly get any votes on the House floor yesterday.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.522]  We're going to play that clip coming up as well.
[01:34:26.562 --> 01:34:28.743]  That's just some of the news.
[01:34:28.803 --> 01:34:34.526]  Meanwhile, jobs report crushes expectations as hurricane impact fades.
[01:34:35.687 --> 01:34:38.028]  Meanwhile, they're just panicking though the economy is coming back.
[01:34:38.428 --> 01:34:40.469]  But I've got the big EU news here.
[01:34:40.529 --> 01:34:43.791]  And remember, as goes the EU, so goes a lot of the world.
[01:34:44.671 --> 01:34:51.736]  It's globalism's last stand at the unelected private corporate system that is anti-free market, crony capitalists.
[01:34:52.376 --> 01:34:54.598]  They said, if Hillary loses, we're going to fall apart.
[01:34:55.098 --> 01:34:59.782]  And they said, now if the euro collapses, which they predicted it would, it's over.
[01:35:00.042 --> 01:35:09.168]  There'll be a new chance for real global free trade, real global freedom, and Americana worldwide, not kind of a new Soviet Union meets EU bureaucrats.
[01:35:09.228 --> 01:35:12.891]  I've got a stack of articles here, some of them written by Ted Malik.
[01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:14.662]  Here they are.
[01:35:15.243 --> 01:35:16.624]  Pathetic appeaser.
[01:35:17.464 --> 01:35:23.308]  Theresa May makes heavy concessions on money, regulatory alignment to the EU.
[01:35:23.928 --> 01:35:26.410]  So basically a backroom deal to screw Brexit.
[01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:28.751]  Seven days of creation.
[01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:29.992]  Trump's first week as president.
[01:35:30.012 --> 01:35:34.114]  That's a Theodore Roosevelt Malik article on worldnetdaily.com.
[01:35:35.035 --> 01:35:36.216]  RT, United States of Europe.
[01:35:36.636 --> 01:35:37.036]  Germany.
[01:35:37.116 --> 01:35:38.957]  Schultz wants to consolidate EU.
[01:35:39.058 --> 01:35:41.119]  Kick out those who disagree.
[01:35:41.519 --> 01:35:42.820]  They've got a new EU army.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:49.665]  They're threatening the different Eastern European countries with 100,000 euro fines that they don't want illegals in.
[01:35:49.685 --> 01:35:52.367]  They're talking about forcibly bringing them in.
[01:35:52.407 --> 01:35:57.611]  So those are just some of the insane articles on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:57.951 --> 01:35:59.893]  And again, Ted Malik's the best-selling author, but listen.
[01:36:00.984 --> 01:36:07.749]  Studying Davos, studying Bilderberg, studying the Aspen Institute, a lot of groups that he helped, you know, found and was involved in.
[01:36:07.769 --> 01:36:13.093]  I remember reading about Ted Malik 25 years ago, studying key people in globalist organizations.
[01:36:13.493 --> 01:36:14.894]  That doesn't mean everybody in them is bad.
[01:36:15.355 --> 01:36:25.102]  But about a decade ago, I started seeing him really critical of it, saying the EU is going to fall apart, it's going to go down, it's authoritarian, that he got involved in all this to promote freedom worldwide.
[01:36:25.642 --> 01:36:27.504]  And now you've seen Peter Thiel do the same thing.
[01:36:29.013 --> 01:36:34.477]  More and more people, Sean Parker, former head of Facebook, come out and say, you know, this is authoritarian, we gotta stop it.
[01:36:34.737 --> 01:36:44.584]  So kind of the conscience of people that have been inside, I wouldn't say you were one of them, because since I got to read more of your stuff a decade ago, I mean, I realized, how did you get in there then?
[01:36:44.644 --> 01:36:45.545]  Talk about yourself.
[01:36:45.825 --> 01:36:55.812]  Explain how a fellow like you from Canada ends up at the very highest levels on the board of directors of some of the top organizations like Davos and a Bilderberg public,
[01:36:56.272 --> 01:37:02.315]  What got you to the highest levels of it, and then what made you one of the early people to say it's going down?
[01:37:02.335 --> 01:37:07.198]  I mean, a real trailblazer predicting what we're now in the middle phases of.
[01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:10.639]  Well, I'm from Philadelphia, not from Canada, but... I forgot!
[01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:11.800]  You used to live in Canada, right?
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.562]  I did my PhD in Canada, so I have some Canadiana about me, but...
[01:37:15.882 --> 01:37:17.443]  I'm from Canada.
[01:37:18.163 --> 01:37:18.823]  I think that.
[01:37:18.863 --> 01:37:20.063]  You're an American, I'm just joking.
[01:37:20.203 --> 01:37:24.425]  Academic credentials actually still have some validity in our world.
[01:37:24.485 --> 01:37:27.366]  I've got, you know, enough of those for a lot, but ten people, so.
[01:37:27.546 --> 01:37:28.106]  As a Canadian.
[01:37:28.766 --> 01:37:28.986]  Yeah.
[01:37:29.286 --> 01:37:37.609]  So when you have those, and at an early age you start doing things, and I was in the State Department when I was 28, I was running the UN in Europe when I was 35.
[01:37:37.889 --> 01:37:41.430]  You, you know, people keep giving you other opportunities.
[01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:44.091]  They liked your resume, they liked the way you act, the way you think.
[01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:47.552]  And, uh, you know, it opens up a lot of opportunities.
[01:37:47.592 --> 01:37:50.453]  By the way, his book that he inscribed to me is in my car.
[01:37:50.913 --> 01:37:53.054]  Will somebody go grab that out of my front seat of my car?
[01:37:53.074 --> 01:37:53.314]  Thanks.
[01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:53.614]  Go ahead.
[01:37:53.815 --> 01:37:54.415]  I want to show that.
[01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:55.815]  You're reading it while you drive.
[01:37:55.835 --> 01:37:58.336]  You've got to at least a little... No, I already read your book.
[01:37:58.796 --> 01:38:00.177]  Davos, Aspen, and Yale.
[01:38:01.377 --> 01:38:03.758]  By the way, uh... They're in my office.
[01:38:04.198 --> 01:38:05.599]  By the way, you're a good-looking guy there on the cover.
[01:38:06.164 --> 01:38:07.605]  Well, that's a few years ago.
[01:38:07.625 --> 01:38:12.931]  I think that picture was taken in 1992, so some of us age better than others.
[01:38:13.751 --> 01:38:18.356]  So you grow up in Philadelphia, but you go to school in Canada, come back to the U.S., Yale, you name it.
[01:38:18.736 --> 01:38:20.198]  I mean, break down in that process.
[01:38:20.758 --> 01:38:29.467]  Yeah, so actually it's a statement about career, not ambition, blind ambition, but something students can learn from if you're a good student, if you work hard.
[01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:38.807]  If you're thoughtful, and I had some great mentors along the way who were very conservatives, you know, both in political philosophy and in economics.
[01:38:39.287 --> 01:38:45.268]  You have opportunities, you take them, you work in, you know, different places, even in the private sector.
[01:38:45.588 --> 01:38:49.149]  In America, we go in and out of the private sector, so I've done that numerous times.
[01:38:49.689 --> 01:38:56.790]  And it builds up what we used to call a Rolodex, which is really a network, and people keep calling on you to do things because you can actually deliver.
[01:38:57.130 --> 01:39:03.615]  I was about to say, because you're not just big in academia, you've been really successful in business and also coaching corporations.
[01:39:03.995 --> 01:39:05.056]  I mean, you've done a lot of stuff.
[01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:14.563]  I know, I've worked with 150 companies, I've worked on, I think I've been on 36 boards of both think tanks, universities, large corporations.
[01:39:14.583 --> 01:39:22.309]  So, again, what made you get into the power structure, and then once you're there, when did you start becoming that force against globalism in the middle of it?
[01:39:22.609 --> 01:39:45.859]  Well, I think even at the beginning, I had an acumen, which largely grew out of my reading of the great books, which my father brought me up to read, and my Sunday school teachers who taught me about the history of Christianity, and I always had this kind of ethical dimension so that when I saw something, I could actually describe it as good, bad, or indifferent.
[01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:48.000]  You're not Canadian, but you are a theologian, then?
[01:39:48.799 --> 01:39:59.462]  Well, I have some degrees in theology, and I have certainly studied theology, and I am a practicing Christian, and that makes some other people, certainly in the secular and in the globalist world, very nervous besides.
[01:39:59.642 --> 01:40:01.022]  We talked about it at dinner last night.
[01:40:01.042 --> 01:40:04.143]  I mean, there's a lot of Luciferianism in globalism.
[01:40:04.343 --> 01:40:04.683]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:05.243 --> 01:40:05.564]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:06.284 --> 01:40:10.445]  So, anyway, you're in the inside of this... You don't want me to go there, do you?
[01:40:10.565 --> 01:40:10.865]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:11.485]  Yeah, no.
[01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.246]  We're going to go there a little bit later.
[01:40:13.266 --> 01:40:13.726]  Next hour.
[01:40:14.066 --> 01:40:14.426]  Keep going.
[01:40:14.446 --> 01:40:14.666]  Sorry.
[01:40:15.126 --> 01:40:17.829]  Yeah, so you see a lot of things, you meet a lot of people.
[01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:25.596]  Some of them are fine actors, and I've had the ability to be around some very fine political corporate actors.
[01:40:25.676 --> 01:40:29.720]  I've worked for some really fine companies, but you also see a lot of really bad stuff.
[01:40:30.854 --> 01:40:33.476]  And I've not been afraid to name names.
[01:40:34.297 --> 01:40:39.320]  And, you know, in this memoir, which I wrote largely for my kids, because they asked me, what is it that you do, Dad?
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.641]  They didn't really know.
[01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:41.902]  I've been on a lot of airplanes.
[01:40:42.583 --> 01:40:43.584]  And I told them the story.
[01:40:43.624 --> 01:40:44.825]  And that's the story.
[01:40:44.885 --> 01:40:49.968]  And it's an insider's story of, you know, how you can be salt and... It's a powerful book.
[01:40:50.048 --> 01:40:51.069]  I learned a lot from it.
[01:40:54.304 --> 01:40:56.748]  So you're inside the situation from the beginning.
[01:40:57.188 --> 01:41:00.012]  They knew you were pro-America, pro-free market.
[01:41:00.473 --> 01:41:04.679]  And I guess they kind of sold globalism early on as kind of Americana worldwide.
[01:41:04.699 --> 01:41:07.563]  But at what point did you really start to criticize it?
[01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:10.528]  And why did they leave you right in the middle of it if you were so critical of it?
[01:41:11.854 --> 01:41:14.015]  Well, I think this is a gradual process.
[01:41:14.075 --> 01:41:21.861]  You know, in the 1992-95 period, globalization and Americanization were somewhat synonymous, as you suggest.
[01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:26.504]  And it became more and more apparent that these globals had a very, very different agenda.
[01:41:26.524 --> 01:41:27.865]  It had nothing to do with America.
[01:41:28.425 --> 01:41:34.087]  They would use America, use America funding, use American political prowess, but they really had their own agenda.
[01:41:34.127 --> 01:41:46.793]  And that's very evident in what I call the EU-SSR, because it is really, just as I describe it, a kind of new Soviet Union, if you will, that has very, very strong globalist agenda.
[01:41:47.473 --> 01:41:55.936]  And it's apparent that this transatlantic relationship, which we have largely paid for since World War II, is built on the wrong premise.
[01:41:56.256 --> 01:41:57.536]  They've taken advantage of us.
[01:41:57.636 --> 01:42:00.377]  As Trump said, you know, we were really a goat.
[01:42:01.817 --> 01:42:02.598]  They took our money.
[01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:03.618]  They took our defense.
[01:42:03.858 --> 01:42:06.279]  We've paid 80% of the costs of NATO.
[01:42:07.899 --> 01:42:08.920]  And we've looked the other way.
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:19.608]  Germany, which is a very wealthy country, certainly the engine of growth in Europe, is paying less than 2% of its annual GDP for defense.
[01:42:20.449 --> 01:42:19.608]  1.32%.
[01:42:20.969 --> 01:42:27.414]  I mean, we're paying for Germany's welfare state as a result of our subsidy of NATO.
[01:42:27.814 --> 01:42:30.555]  That's really it, is globalists have used control of the U.S.
[01:42:30.595 --> 01:42:36.956]  government to parlay our wealth into all their own little adventures in the world and propping us up.
[01:42:37.056 --> 01:42:46.059]  And so as soon as Trump took the government's foot off our necks, suddenly things came roaring back and all these entitled little globalists are now completely panicking.
[01:42:46.119 --> 01:42:49.960]  So I want to talk to you about, you predicted what's happened over a decade ago.
[01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:57.218]  Then give us the bird's eye view from an insider who wasn't an insider on what's going to happen next.
[01:42:57.618 --> 01:42:58.779]  Ted Malek, straight ahead.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.781]  We'll also tell you about his books.
[01:43:00.081 --> 01:43:00.502]  Stay with us.
[01:43:03.271 --> 01:43:04.652]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:43:04.672 --> 01:43:05.773]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:43:06.033 --> 01:43:06.954]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:12.478]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:12.558 --> 01:43:26.127]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:43:26.187 --> 01:43:27.568]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:43:28.328 --> 01:43:29.930]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:32.472]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:32.572 --> 01:43:33.834]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:34.975]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:43:34.995 --> 01:43:36.036]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:36.336 --> 01:43:40.661]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:40.861 --> 01:43:44.044]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:44.104 --> 01:43:47.206]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:47.226 --> 01:43:48.227]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:46:05.937 --> 01:46:20.610]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:28.238]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:28.778 --> 01:46:39.610]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:39.991 --> 01:46:46.138]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:46.278 --> 01:46:48.941]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:46:49.441 --> 01:46:56.010]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:46:56.350 --> 01:47:00.976]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.412 --> 01:47:20.695]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
[01:47:21.915 --> 01:47:28.198]  Let your heart be light.
[01:47:28.278 --> 01:47:33.920]  Next year all our troubles will be alright.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.081]  That's Judy Garland, folks!
[01:47:42.829 --> 01:47:46.434]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
[01:47:48.055 --> 01:47:48.795]  Hey, beep that!
[01:47:48.975 --> 01:47:50.776]  The FCC's talking about banning that word.
[01:47:50.816 --> 01:47:51.917]  You know, I'm not joking.
[01:47:51.937 --> 01:47:53.197]  That's how this political correctness works.
[01:47:53.937 --> 01:47:57.339]  Joining us for the next hour and 15 minutes or so is Ted Malek.
[01:47:58.079 --> 01:48:13.985]  He's an academic, business guy, best-selling author, been on the board of the Davos Group, been part of many of the top globalist organizations, but over the years promoting Americana and resisting it, and was one of the first people inside the organizations, was it over a decade ago,
[01:48:14.685 --> 01:48:15.846]  Saying, hey, they're going down.
[01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:16.626]  It's falling apart.
[01:48:16.646 --> 01:48:17.507]  It's authoritarian.
[01:48:17.747 --> 01:48:18.968]  The EU is going to go down.
[01:48:19.048 --> 01:48:20.109]  America is going to come back.
[01:48:20.729 --> 01:48:22.911]  So just briefly, how were you able to predict it?
[01:48:23.351 --> 01:48:24.432]  What did you witness?
[01:48:24.492 --> 01:48:42.364]  And then tell us the next shoe to drop with Europe as people resist its unelected authoritarianism inside Europe, doubles down with an EU army, says you will accept the Islamic invasion, becomes even more pushy, repeating history, even after they just witnessed the Brexit.
[01:48:42.704 --> 01:48:44.465]  It seems to only make them more arrogant.
[01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:50.401]  Well, the answer to the first question is, I think that you do analysis.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:49:11.394]  You look at the options, you do future scenarios, you look at the trend lines, and I was an early caller in this game to say that this was going to happen, and in conversations with all kinds of leaders, both in the US and in Europe, you know, we've been able to make that prediction.
[01:49:11.995 --> 01:49:16.278]  So I would say that in the Trump eight years of administration,
[01:49:16.958 --> 01:49:19.201]  And I believe it will be eight years of administration.
[01:49:19.822 --> 01:49:25.588]  We will see the world shift even more radically in our direction.
[01:49:26.049 --> 01:49:27.070]  America is back.
[01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:30.854]  That's just a huge statement in and of itself.
[01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:32.877]  And I think we have one person to thank for that.
[01:49:33.712 --> 01:49:38.656]  And globalism is all about losing your nation states, losing your individual cultures.
[01:49:38.716 --> 01:49:44.481]  They admit that, and it's such an ugly, horrible, final revolution.
[01:49:44.501 --> 01:49:47.724]  It is true tyranny.
[01:49:48.925 --> 01:49:53.449]  I mean, it's an attack on free will, and then here comes Trump, here comes populism, why now?
[01:49:54.963 --> 01:50:03.726]  Well, we don't eat European food, we don't speak European language, we don't homogenize everything so that there's no distinctness.
[01:50:03.886 --> 01:50:08.307]  I mean, the beauty of culture is its differentiation, its peculiarity.
[01:50:08.347 --> 01:50:11.948]  So, I think we see this movement in Europe now.
[01:50:12.028 --> 01:50:14.109]  It's very strong in Eastern Europe.
[01:50:14.969 --> 01:50:16.689]  It's obviously very strong in Britain.
[01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:19.970]  There are elements in every single European country.
[01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:24.871]  I think the European elections are proving this, will prove it next year in Italy.
[01:50:25.611 --> 01:50:29.452]  All these countries are moving back to their own nationhood.
[01:50:30.132 --> 01:50:32.033]  And there's no reason they can't all be great.
[01:50:32.053 --> 01:50:34.993]  I mean, greatness is infinitely wide.
[01:50:35.013 --> 01:50:38.634]  It doesn't mean they have to be at war or competing with each other.
[01:50:39.497 --> 01:50:47.139]  And I think that America sets the bar, sets the bar very high on that, and a lot of people, still everywhere in the world, will follow what's happening in America.
[01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:59.202]  So, the world is moving away from this, you know, new world order back to an order that has more to do with states and has to do with national localities.
[01:51:00.464 --> 01:51:02.247]  A lot of people say, I don't care about Europe.
[01:51:02.888 --> 01:51:07.955]  But they have to understand, even the globalists themselves say, if Hillary loses, we're almost completely defeated.
[01:51:10.718 --> 01:51:13.319]  And then the European Union will fall next.
[01:51:13.859 --> 01:51:14.719]  Why is that a good thing?
[01:51:14.759 --> 01:51:22.281]  Well, it's unelected, it's authoritarian, it was snuck in under trade deals, just like NAFTA and GATT and TPP, and it's about self-determination.
[01:51:22.341 --> 01:51:30.443]  We're being conquered by this global cabal, and its main final command base is the European Union and the United Nations.
[01:51:31.083 --> 01:51:35.564]  And so, I mean, this is really the battle of the 21st century for freedom.
[01:51:35.884 --> 01:51:38.505]  This is the battle of these decades.
[01:51:38.885 --> 01:51:39.425]  I think we've
[01:51:40.485 --> 01:51:48.909]  Actually surprised them because we're starting to take back territory in a sense I mean the way I put it is with Trump.
[01:51:48.929 --> 01:51:56.273]  We're no longer on the defensive We're on the offensive and everything he does weekend actually day in day out.
[01:51:56.333 --> 01:52:08.299]  That's what's so amazing about it It's not just it's not just a you know occurring here and there willy-nilly once in a while every day something is happening on Trump's watch Israel this week
[01:52:08.968 --> 01:52:22.144]  You know, Jerusalem, Middle East, Russia... Order secured, economy coming back, and it's the perfect timing of how he waited and did all this, and then just right at the right time as the stars aligned, historically, boom!
[01:52:22.765 --> 01:52:23.305]  It's biblical.
[01:52:24.068 --> 01:52:24.348]  It is.
[01:52:24.468 --> 01:52:32.551]  So I wrote an article some months ago, actually, at the time of the election, saying with Trump's election, it'll be like the first seven days of creation.
[01:52:33.131 --> 01:52:35.371]  And I meant that not literally, but metaphorically.
[01:52:35.652 --> 01:52:43.514]  And the fact is, almost everything that I laid out in that article has happened already, and we've only witnessed the first year of Donald J. Trump.
[01:52:44.134 --> 01:52:47.598]  Let's talk about the first seven days of Trump's creation.
[01:52:47.618 --> 01:52:49.400]  In fact, I've got the article right there.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:50.461]  Let's go back over that.
[01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:52.183]  You predicted it a year ago.
[01:52:52.523 --> 01:52:53.464]  Here we are a year later.
[01:52:54.125 --> 01:52:55.286]  It's a checklist.
[01:52:55.446 --> 01:52:56.287]  It's quite amazing.
[01:52:56.367 --> 01:52:57.228]  What will he do?
[01:52:57.668 --> 01:53:00.511]  Immediately he'll end all of Obama's executive orders.
[01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:00.812]  Done.
[01:53:01.452 --> 01:53:03.093]  He'll try to stop Obamacare.
[01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:04.074]  He wanted to do it.
[01:53:04.534 --> 01:53:05.435]  It's the damn U.S.
[01:53:05.495 --> 01:53:07.016]  Senate that stopped him from doing it.
[01:53:07.636 --> 01:53:11.178]  And he'll, as I said here, cut off the head of the snake called ISIS.
[01:53:11.298 --> 01:53:12.639]  Don, you go down this list.
[01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:13.200]  It's now defeated.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:16.722]  This checklist of some 30... The Russians declared two days ago they're defeated.
[01:53:17.179 --> 01:53:18.020]  Yeah, they're defeated.
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:21.624]  But this list, there are maybe two or three things he still has to do.
[01:53:22.045 --> 01:53:23.987]  So it's, he hasn't yet built the wall.
[01:53:24.047 --> 01:53:32.337]  I said that the... By the way, CNN wrote articles yesterday saying Trump's keeping his promise, promise keeper, and showed how he's done at least half or more of everything he said.
[01:53:32.557 --> 01:53:33.839]  And they were saying that was a bad thing.
[01:53:34.429 --> 01:53:39.412]  Oh yeah, they believe it's a bad thing because they're in the business of media malpractice.
[01:53:39.472 --> 01:53:40.833]  That's a term you've coined.
[01:53:40.893 --> 01:53:44.255]  It's a term I've coined, and I wanted you to use it, so I'm glad you're using it.
[01:53:44.295 --> 01:53:54.001]  But the fact is, CNN and other networks, but now it's all those networks, it's all the mainstream networks, are basically just anti-Trump networks.
[01:53:54.401 --> 01:53:55.482]  And people are turning it off.
[01:53:55.522 --> 01:53:56.783]  It's just like the NFL games.
[01:53:56.823 --> 01:53:57.803]  People have stopped going.
[01:53:57.823 --> 01:53:58.664]  And that's my next question.
[01:53:59.284 --> 01:54:05.868]  The NFL has lost like 35% just this last year and a half, 50% total the last three years being political, and they don't care.
[01:54:05.909 --> 01:54:06.789]  They can't stop.
[01:54:07.169 --> 01:54:09.171]  It's just, they're killing themselves.
[01:54:09.491 --> 01:54:10.612]  Well, they're going to go out of business.
[01:54:10.632 --> 01:54:16.195]  They're going to have a going-out-of-business sale, if that's what they intend to do, then put the guy back in charge, and they seem to have done that.
[01:54:16.215 --> 01:54:20.198]  Don't they get that even if they kill Trump, that would make him a martyr that they're going to lose?
[01:54:20.378 --> 01:54:24.461]  Well, I don't even like to have that thought, and I pray that he has security every night.
[01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:27.922]  But the fact is Trump is doing all the stuff on this list.
[01:54:27.942 --> 01:54:32.783]  This was my wish list of everything could happen in the best biblical account.
[01:54:33.083 --> 01:54:35.763]  And he's done like 90% of the stuff.
[01:54:37.264 --> 01:54:40.484]  Now he's got to put more good people, I think, into the administration.
[01:54:40.504 --> 01:54:45.945]  He's been successful with executive action because the globalists had put so much power in the executive to circumvent the people.
[01:54:45.985 --> 01:54:49.686]  But he, again, their strength, he made it their weakness.
[01:54:50.046 --> 01:54:54.327]  And now, OTPP, boom, nap to get, renegotiate, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:54:55.067 --> 01:54:55.928]  One after the other.
[01:54:56.028 --> 01:54:58.830]  These are things that people said he could not do.
[01:54:59.530 --> 01:55:03.733]  His advisors even said, well, maybe you should think about doing that twice.
[01:55:03.813 --> 01:55:07.335]  Or, how could you defund this part of the United Nations?
[01:55:07.715 --> 01:55:12.098]  How could you allow the Israelis to have a capital in Jerusalem?
[01:55:12.598 --> 01:55:14.319]  We're just fulfilling these promises.
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:22.424]  Yeah, 30 years ago they passed a law to do this, and all the other presidents have agreed to it, and then Trump goes, oh, you're going to blow us up if they have a Capitol?
[01:55:22.484 --> 01:55:24.305]  Well, you know, we can't live in fear.
[01:55:24.905 --> 01:55:34.290]  Well, the next thing that happens, I'll predict it right here, is he'll solve the North Korean dilemma, which is really Adamically's sword hanging over our head.
[01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:44.578]  And the way he'll do that, and he's already, and you hear some of his advisors like Madison McMaster talking for him, the way he'll do that is escalate the rhetoric, which he's done.
[01:55:45.019 --> 01:55:47.381]  He's going to enforce a complete sanction.
[01:55:47.841 --> 01:55:52.805]  He's actually going to, I think, put an embargo on North Korea.
[01:55:53.206 --> 01:56:02.954]  He will then use EMP weapons in order to change the entire scenario, and we will see the end of that regime
[01:56:03.832 --> 01:56:04.954]  In North Korea.
[01:56:05.014 --> 01:56:09.742]  Are you saying he'll move EMP weapons in to make them sue for peace or he'll hit them with EMP?
[01:56:09.902 --> 01:56:10.503]  I think he'll hit them.
[01:56:13.697 --> 01:56:16.119]  Well, they're moving the troops and everybody in.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:19.222]  Our military sources say they've been told we're going to hit North Korea.
[01:56:19.582 --> 01:56:23.105]  Well, I mean, all you have to do is listen to the National Security Advisor.
[01:56:23.146 --> 01:56:27.710]  He said the chances of that are increasing, he said the other day, day by day.
[01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:33.235]  So knowing all the establishment elite speak, you're saying this is serious?
[01:56:33.675 --> 01:56:39.060]  It's going to happen, and I'll predict it's going to happen in the next six months of the year 2018.
[01:56:41.348 --> 01:56:43.172]  Kim Jong-un better get his act together.
[01:56:43.192 --> 01:56:44.956]  Boy, I tell you, this is crazy.
[01:56:44.976 --> 01:56:45.837]  I pray for peace.
[01:56:46.178 --> 01:56:48.603]  We're going to go to break and come back and I want to get into...
[01:56:49.907 --> 01:56:56.709]  Things you want to talk about, about the world, where we are, what's happening from your perspective, you know, being inside the highest levels of this system.
[01:56:57.069 --> 01:57:03.530]  By the way, folks, don't do your Christmas shopping with the big establishment stores if you don't want to, you know, fund the enemy or Jeff Bezos or any of that.
[01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:04.871]  Do it at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:57:13.813 --> 01:57:16.733]  Colloidal silver, again, is great, so is the iodine.

[01:57:22.516 --> 01:57:28.942]  And our new product, Alpha Power with LJ100 and a bunch of other key things is in.
[01:57:29.002 --> 01:57:30.183]  It's going to be our best-selling product.
[01:57:30.263 --> 01:57:30.763]  I know it is.
[01:57:31.063 --> 01:57:34.926]  But be careful of this because it's powerful for the brain, stamina, libido, you name it.
[01:57:35.507 --> 01:57:38.609]  It works so well, it's just joke level how good it is.
[01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:40.371]  I know it's going to be our new best-selling product.

[01:57:42.693 --> 01:57:43.834]  Alpha Power, available
[01:57:52.187 --> 01:57:54.448]  Merry Christmas, my fellow InfoWarriors!
[01:57:55.109 --> 01:58:04.293]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[01:58:05.319 --> 01:58:18.384]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product at Infowarslife.com because it works so well.
[01:58:18.944 --> 01:58:20.865]  It is Alpha Power.
[01:58:22.066 --> 01:58:22.786]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:58:24.142 --> 01:58:35.395]  Alpha Power is so strong, so concentrated, that quite frankly a lot of you might want to use some of the other products we've previously come out with that are excellent but aren't anywhere as strong.
[01:58:36.536 --> 01:58:40.300]  It's hard to quantify the stamina, the energy, the libido.
[01:58:41.081 --> 01:58:43.183]  The crazed mental focus.
[01:58:43.623 --> 01:58:44.484]  But let me just say this.
[01:58:45.245 --> 01:58:46.326]  Use this with care.
[01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:52.351]  And alpha power works synergistically with super male vitality and super female vitality.
[01:58:52.591 --> 01:58:53.311]  But I want to be clear.
[01:58:54.052 --> 01:58:55.773]  We could have called this formula something like...
[01:58:56.794 --> 01:58:58.695]  Alpha male or alpha man?
[01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:05.358]  No, it's alpha power because it has incredible effects in women as well.
[01:59:05.758 --> 01:59:10.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, God gave us some incredible gifts through Mother Nature.
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:19.344]  And alpha power, I know, is going to end up probably being our number one bestseller at InfoWarsLife.com and helping you with your stamina, your life.
[01:59:19.644 --> 01:59:21.926]  It certainly has done that for me and so many others.
[01:59:22.206 --> 01:59:24.507]  And also funding the Information War Against the Globe.
[01:59:25.447 --> 01:59:33.611]  Alpha Power, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com, right in time to be under the tree or in the stocking.
[01:59:33.651 --> 01:59:42.456]  This is a gift you want to give yourself, and then rest assured, you're fighting the Info War, so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.
[01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:50.320]  But again, don't believe me, try Alpha Power, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com for yourself.
[01:59:56.988 --> 02:00:00.124]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:10.299 --> 02:00:15.122]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.522 --> 02:00:17.103]  TedMalik.com is the website.
[02:00:17.123 --> 02:00:37.734]  Ted Malik, great American patriot, born and raised in Philadelphia, studied all over the place, went to Yale, went to college up in Canada as well, got into the top heights of the globalist operation, and has been fighting for Americana ever since, and has been heralding and basically portending, that is predicting with accuracy now, the fall of the New World Order.
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:40.901]  Incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:41.481 --> 02:00:42.602]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:00:43.282 --> 02:00:53.167]  We have some very exciting news that one of the main operatives of the Globalist that has been causing incredible problems, stacking the Trump operation with Globalist.
[02:00:53.848 --> 02:00:56.809]  I'm gonna let you go ahead, my friend, and announce what just broke.
[02:00:57.089 --> 02:00:59.151]  Well, this is very good news to see this headline.
[02:00:59.191 --> 02:01:04.674]  Dana Powell, the Deputy National Security Advisor, is to depart the Trump White House.
[02:01:05.374 --> 02:01:07.155]  This is one of the leading Globalists
[02:01:08.067 --> 02:01:12.974]  In the White House, she shouldn't have been there in the first place, so it's very good news to hear that she is leaving.
[02:01:12.994 --> 02:01:15.778]  I hope she takes with her a bunch of other people.
[02:01:16.531 --> 02:01:20.772]  And some of the deep state, of course, that's the problem because, you know, in the U.S.
[02:01:20.812 --> 02:01:29.895]  government, whether it's the Department of State, the Department of Justice, the National Security Council, you go down the list, these deep state operatives are embedded.
[02:01:30.296 --> 02:01:36.017]  Many of them go back decades and certainly many of them are very attached to the Obama ideology.
[02:01:36.057 --> 02:01:39.138]  So this is really, I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
[02:01:39.198 --> 02:01:43.260]  It's very good news and I think Gary Cohn, I'll make a prediction, will be the next one to go.
[02:01:44.564 --> 02:01:57.869]  In fact, we were talking earlier, I don't know if this can even be said yet, but little birdies have told you, Gary Cohn, formerly Goldman Sachs, that's been caught bad-mouthing the President quite a bit and undermining him, you've heard him, he's going to be gone?
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:01.661]  I think that's, I mean, it's an easy prediction to make.
[02:02:02.001 --> 02:02:20.585]  The other prediction, of course, that's out is that the Secretary of State, who's really not operating as Secretary of State, he's probably the weakest Secretary of State the country's ever had, will be gone in February once his stock situation clears so he can have his tax-free, you know, tax status as a result of serving in the U.S.
[02:02:20.605 --> 02:02:22.766]  government for a year and we'll have a new Secretary of State.
[02:02:23.806 --> 02:02:28.868]  These are big changes on the national security and on the international front.
[02:02:29.468 --> 02:02:38.290]  And hopefully Trump will make the decision, and I think there's a clear indication, to pick people this time that are more closely aligned with his worldview.
[02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.871]  Wow!
[02:02:40.051 --> 02:02:41.051]  Dina Powell out.
[02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:42.391]  This is huge breaking news.
[02:02:42.451 --> 02:02:50.013]  And again, I don't do this to toot my horn, but I came on air today and I said exclusive email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents.
[02:02:50.513 --> 02:02:52.054]  And I said this was in September.
[02:02:53.018 --> 02:02:56.179]  We had these a month and a half before with the key.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.700]  Everybody had the keys.
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.641]  The keys were given out.
[02:02:59.201 --> 02:03:02.402]  Exclusive email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents.
[02:03:02.763 --> 02:03:04.824]  I said this morning, this is pure poppycock.
[02:03:05.244 --> 02:03:12.047]  Now even the Washington Post has to admit, email pointed Trump campaign to WikiLeaks documents that were already public.
[02:03:12.467 --> 02:03:13.788]  So somebody sent
[02:03:14.693 --> 02:03:21.140]  The campaign in email with public WikiLeaks a month and a half after they're out, and that's the Russian collusion.
[02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:23.443]  I mean, they haven't even proven WikiLeaks is Russian.
[02:03:23.823 --> 02:03:27.107]  Now, getting public WikiLeaks a month and a half later is the proof.
[02:03:27.347 --> 02:03:28.909]  Top story on CNN this morning.
[02:03:29.892 --> 02:03:39.697]  Well, in the case of Russiagate, we have a situation where Vesel Kanaya, the Russian lawyer who was meeting in Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr.
[02:03:39.757 --> 02:03:54.644]  and Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, was meeting the hour before with GPS Fusion and meeting the hour after with GPS Fusion, which is all tied back into the original Steele dossier.
[02:03:54.804 --> 02:03:55.824]  And that's all the fake...
[02:03:57.345 --> 02:04:00.851]  Made up, perjury, false affidavit.
[02:04:01.152 --> 02:04:09.265]  Instead of them making an original false affidavit, because they had no witnesses, they just made up fiction, had that brought in by the FBI, certified, and then given to the court.
[02:04:09.961 --> 02:04:10.521]  Absolutely.
[02:04:10.561 --> 02:04:14.743]  And this dossier is really the nub of the whole thing.
[02:04:15.084 --> 02:04:16.724]  And I've been doing research.
[02:04:16.764 --> 02:04:17.845]  You know I live in London.
[02:04:18.025 --> 02:04:34.613]  I've been able to crack into MI6 and into some other people who can tell me the real truth on how this document was created, who created it, what his view is, how he is a globalist himself, actually a Fabian socialist, and what is behind that dossier.
[02:04:34.653 --> 02:04:37.274]  That's a very, very provocative story.
[02:04:38.735 --> 02:04:39.796]  Ted Malek, folks.
[02:04:40.116 --> 02:04:42.438]  Davos Group, Board, Aspen Institute.
[02:04:42.899 --> 02:04:44.600]  Didn't you found a bunch of some of these, too?
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:47.422]  Well, probably on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
[02:04:49.484 --> 02:04:50.425]  What was your involvement with Aspen?
[02:04:50.445 --> 02:04:51.005]  Did you found that?
[02:04:51.385 --> 02:04:51.766]  No, no.
[02:04:52.226 --> 02:04:54.188]  Aspen actually was a great organization.
[02:04:54.208 --> 02:04:55.209]  Didn't you used to head it up, though?
[02:04:55.429 --> 02:04:59.552]  I was the head of all national seminars and custom programs.
[02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:00.553]  See, I just go off memory.
[02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:01.434]  We'll be back.
[02:05:03.843 --> 02:05:06.727]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[02:05:06.827 --> 02:05:15.860]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:17.161]  So what do we do about it?
[02:05:17.342 --> 02:05:20.466]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:05:20.666 --> 02:05:28.271]  Fight back with the all new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[02:05:28.391 --> 02:05:34.515]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[02:05:34.655 --> 02:05:41.320]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:42.640]  Added kick!

[02:05:56.127 --> 02:05:57.248]  It's the real deal.
[02:05:57.448 --> 02:05:58.989]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:05:59.189 --> 02:06:02.530]  Secure your bottle right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:21.163]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:21.944 --> 02:06:30.872]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:06:34.776 --> 02:06:42.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Malik, one of the board members of the Davos Group, former head of the Aspen Institute, you name it, is in studio.
[02:06:43.071 --> 02:06:46.737]  And let me tell you, he's got amazing sources in our government, in other governments.
[02:06:46.777 --> 02:06:47.599]  He lives in London.
[02:06:48.908 --> 02:06:52.131]  He was telling me a lot of stuff MI6 told him at dinner last night.
[02:06:52.151 --> 02:06:55.994]  I didn't know we could get into that, but he's willing to get into it right now.
[02:06:56.674 --> 02:06:58.136]  But here's the big breaking news.
[02:06:58.516 --> 02:07:09.325]  Dina Powell, Deputy National Security Advisor, one of the key baddies that brought in all these bad globalists, leftists, and also neocons, to depart Trump White House.
[02:07:09.345 --> 02:07:10.265]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:07:10.706 --> 02:07:11.787]  And I gotta give the Washington Post
[02:07:12.547 --> 02:07:20.177]  Actually, a little bit of credit, Jeff Bezos's Washington Post, maybe they realize that, you know, they're about to lose, so they're going to back off because they've been the worst so far.
[02:07:20.878 --> 02:07:25.524]  Email pointed Trump campaign to WikiLeaks documents that were already public.
[02:07:26.184 --> 02:07:29.268]  So now CNN has a top story today that it's over for Trump.
[02:07:30.269 --> 02:07:34.114]  Uh, that they had Wikileaks, that Wikileaks sent them an email.
[02:07:34.334 --> 02:07:42.905]  Well no, a citizen sent them an email to public stuff off 4chan and InfoWars and you name it, with public Wikileaks that were a month and a half old.
[02:07:42.965 --> 02:07:47.390]  I mean, this is like saying Donald Trump read the Washington Post, I mean, or the New York Times.
[02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:58.215]  But again, they just act like all of this is some big, giant evil, and they've caught them in something bad, that if you've ever read a WikiLeak, you're a Russian agent, even though WikiLeaks is not Russian.
[02:07:58.675 --> 02:08:02.757]  And even though CNN would beg to have Julian Assange on, or get the next WikiLeaks.
[02:08:02.797 --> 02:08:06.359]  So, this is just absolutely beyond a nothing burger.
[02:08:06.999 --> 02:08:08.680]  So, Ted Mallon, let's get your take on this.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:18.804]  And then get in to MI6, and the PPGate dossier, and Mr. Steele, and Mr. Strzok, and the judge recusing themselves over Flynn.
[02:08:19.164 --> 02:08:23.686]  I mean, this thing is collapsing like a landslide right now.
[02:08:24.586 --> 02:08:27.148]  It's collapsed right in front of us.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.841]  You know, the facts are clear.
[02:08:30.861 --> 02:08:32.581]  This is media malpractice.
[02:08:32.641 --> 02:08:33.702]  It's what we have to call it.
[02:08:33.722 --> 02:08:35.522]  We should have a class action suit.
[02:08:35.602 --> 02:08:41.804]  All Americans should join it and say we're not watching these fake news outlets any longer.
[02:08:41.925 --> 02:08:54.689]  I mean, when I go on CNN and Christine Amanpour or any one of those other people tries to interrogate you, it's all about assassinating your ideas and trying to do in President Trump.
[02:08:55.189 --> 02:09:01.571]  So there's nothing objective about any... They've got a mission, they tailor all info to fit that BS.
[02:09:01.611 --> 02:09:10.855]  They are on a mission and they have actually, you know, made a dent in that mission but now the screws are coming out and it's absolutely
[02:09:11.656 --> 02:09:16.021]  Uh, clear what they're up to, and I think people can read it for themselves.
[02:09:16.522 --> 02:09:28.438]  And thanks to, uh, alternate news sources and people that can get out the truth, and that includes InfoWars amongst others, we're able to assess a truer, clearer, more comprehensive picture.
[02:09:28.638 --> 02:09:47.131]  Let's be clear, you said thanks to one man and thanks to God for giving us him, but thanks to you and Matt Drudge and Breitbart and countless others at WorldNetDaily over the decades exposing what's going on and the people, number one, and being involved, it created a climate for this to happen and now that the wheels are coming off,
[02:09:48.346 --> 02:09:52.410]  As this becomes discredited, it's going to supercharge everything we're doing.
[02:09:52.430 --> 02:10:02.719]  But without Trump's stalwart focus, without his commitment, without his courage, without his family being willing to bust their asses and go through all this, we would not be here.
[02:10:02.739 --> 02:10:06.043]  Without that leadership, this wouldn't have all come together.
[02:10:06.063 --> 02:10:09.886]  But I'm telling you, it is a perfect storm against globalism.
[02:10:09.926 --> 02:10:12.448]  But let's not start celebrating too much yet.
[02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:17.112]  I want to get into how you think they're going to counter-strike Mr. Malik, but let's get back to MI6.
[02:10:17.332 --> 02:10:19.213]  What did MI6 tell you about the fake dossier?
[02:10:19.273 --> 02:10:26.598]  Well, I've talked to a lot of people, not to disclose names or sources, but people told me over a year ago... You were in the news?
[02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:27.018]  You said it!
[02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:29.480]  I went on BBC and said it, and they couldn't believe it.
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:33.583]  I said, this dossier is a fake dossier, this dossier was produced...
[02:10:33.863 --> 02:10:34.504]  You said it first!
[02:10:50.641 --> 02:10:53.883]  Which was paid for in kind of doses.
[02:10:53.943 --> 02:10:56.965]  The more that Steele produced, the more he got paid.
[02:10:57.386 --> 02:11:01.629]  So therefore he used his Russian sources to give him more and more disinformation.
[02:11:02.049 --> 02:11:07.973]  And the Democrats took over that contract and the firm that ran him was GPS Fusion.
[02:11:08.573 --> 02:11:12.154]  By the way, we should have opened the show up with you with that clip from a year ago.
[02:11:12.174 --> 02:11:18.275]  If you just type in, Ted Malik, MI6 told me that the dossier was fake.
[02:11:19.175 --> 02:11:21.976]  If people will pull that clip, we'll have it for the next segment.
[02:11:22.336 --> 02:11:24.317]  Because a year later, you've been proven completely right.
[02:11:24.357 --> 02:11:29.758]  So, get into more specifics, as they were interrupting you on the show, of what the MI6 sources told you.
[02:11:30.578 --> 02:11:47.824]  Well, they basically corroborated this notion that there was one of their former agents, who has now become a private sector kind of business intelligence guru, who was paid for to manufacture this dossier.
[02:11:48.804 --> 02:11:54.669]  Uh, and he basically gave that information both to MI6 and to the FBI.
[02:11:55.109 --> 02:12:05.997]  He was known to the FBI already because he had researched prior to that the FIFA kinds of controversies, and they actually paid him at some point in time.
[02:12:06.057 --> 02:12:08.499]  He was one of their assets, and they used
[02:12:08.999 --> 02:12:11.000]  That dossier is the key piece.
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:13.600]  They used that dossier to go after Trump.
[02:12:13.961 --> 02:12:16.341]  They've used that dossier to get the FISA warrants.
[02:12:16.681 --> 02:12:19.522]  They've used that dossier to go after Mike Flynn.
[02:12:19.902 --> 02:12:25.784]  That is the linchpin, and it is pure bull.
[02:12:26.244 --> 02:12:33.807]  Even in an interview more recently, Steele said himself, well, 70 or 80% of it is probably true.
[02:12:33.847 --> 02:12:34.187]  Which 70 or 80%?
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.761]  Well, we all know Trump's a complete neat freak, and would never have women peeing on him.
[02:12:46.382 --> 02:12:50.604]  Well, that Golden Shower story is... I mean, I can't wait to see the movie version.
[02:12:51.664 --> 02:13:02.087]  Well, it's just crazy, because people that know Trump, a lot of people have known him like 45 years, not just Roger Stone, he's a one-woman guy, and he's a neat freak, and he just is real picky about women.
[02:13:02.788 --> 02:13:06.709]  So, he's certainly not having sex with random hookers.
[02:13:09.522 --> 02:13:10.643]  The dossier.
[02:13:10.743 --> 02:13:11.803]  It's 35 pages long.
[02:13:12.403 --> 02:13:13.144]  You can read it.
[02:13:13.284 --> 02:13:14.624]  I mean, obviously you can get it and read it.
[02:13:14.644 --> 02:13:15.985]  What about BuzzFeed?
[02:13:16.025 --> 02:13:17.365]  Aren't they getting sued for that too?
[02:13:17.465 --> 02:13:23.328]  Yeah, but it reads like some kind of really, really strange novel.
[02:13:23.688 --> 02:13:28.010]  Not as something that the intelligence community would take seriously.
[02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:30.771]  I mean, you'd think that they'd try to corroborate it.
[02:13:30.871 --> 02:13:33.532]  If you had 17 intelligence agencies, which we have,
[02:13:34.352 --> 02:13:36.357]  That they would get such a document if they could.
[02:13:36.377 --> 02:13:39.686]  No, they got ordered by Deep State and Hillary to go with it and they ran it up like God sent it.
[02:13:39.706 --> 02:13:40.528]  That's exactly what they did.
[02:13:40.568 --> 02:13:43.615]  They didn't verify a single thing in the dossier.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:49.863]  And now we've built this whole... And now they've backed off and went, we actually didn't vet it and we didn't say that.
[02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:53.805]  So what happens next?
[02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:59.408]  I mean, because this is another good sign that you're saying the Goldman Sachs guy's leaving.
[02:14:00.248 --> 02:14:02.570]  We've also got Dina Powell announcing she's leaving.
[02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.831]  This is just more positive Christmas presents.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:07.621]  Well, you've got the Christmas shot there.
[02:14:07.722 --> 02:14:08.682]  It's actually very pretty.
[02:14:08.742 --> 02:14:10.684]  I was in Washington just earlier in the week.
[02:14:10.744 --> 02:14:12.985]  I saw it live, up close and personal.
[02:14:13.025 --> 02:14:13.586]  It's beautiful.
[02:14:13.986 --> 02:14:19.490]  And actually, this year, for the first time in probably two decades, we're able to say, Merry Christmas.
[02:14:20.251 --> 02:14:20.751]  Absolutely.
[02:14:20.791 --> 02:14:22.412]  And in all fairness, it looks like the U.S.
[02:14:22.432 --> 02:14:23.673]  Capitol because it's even taller.
[02:14:24.013 --> 02:14:24.654]  It's not as big.
[02:14:24.674 --> 02:14:25.574]  That's the Texas Capitol.
[02:14:25.935 --> 02:14:26.055]  Oh.
[02:14:27.035 --> 02:14:27.376]  Oh, okay.
[02:14:27.836 --> 02:14:30.737]  No, but it's got a goddess on top, and it's built just the same.
[02:14:31.077 --> 02:14:32.658]  So, I mean, I can see how you missed it there.
[02:14:32.718 --> 02:14:35.539]  Did you see the angel ornament, though, that came out this year?
[02:14:35.579 --> 02:14:37.200]  I'm sure you're buying them for everybody.
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.121]  The demon ornament?
[02:14:38.421 --> 02:14:40.302]  The ornament for the top of your tree.
[02:14:40.322 --> 02:14:41.222]  Little baby Satan?
[02:14:41.802 --> 02:14:44.363]  Well, in this case, it was Hillary Clinton herself.
[02:14:44.604 --> 02:14:46.144]  Oh, I thought it was a demon, but yeah.
[02:14:49.586 --> 02:14:50.586]  Isn't that hilarious?
[02:14:51.307 --> 02:14:52.807]  In fact, guys, there it is!
[02:14:54.108 --> 02:14:56.089]  And look, she even looks like a vampire in the shot!
[02:14:57.574 --> 02:14:58.795]  Well, she's wearing a pantsuit.
[02:14:58.835 --> 02:14:59.596]  Let's give her credit.
[02:14:59.636 --> 02:15:04.981]  You know, though, I mean, I heard on September 11th, though, if you leave the tree up, that the angel falls off the tree.
[02:15:07.042 --> 02:15:07.343]  Oh, my.
[02:15:07.403 --> 02:15:10.926]  I heard the little... Did you hear the angel comes in a little black ambulance?
[02:15:13.173 --> 02:15:19.555]  But then, you've got to be careful because, like, if you leave the angel in your house and there's a piggy bank or something, the money will be gone in the morning.
[02:15:19.875 --> 02:15:21.396]  Just like the Haitian refugee money.
[02:15:21.516 --> 02:15:24.857]  I call the Clintons the greatest kleptocracy in American history.
[02:15:25.277 --> 02:15:27.097]  So that's the next shoe to drop.
[02:15:27.517 --> 02:15:30.058]  We're talking about things that are going to drop early in the next year.
[02:15:30.418 --> 02:15:37.120]  There will be a special council to look into all the wrongdoings of the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation,
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:44.547]  Of their, you know, scurrious deals and that will all be exposed, including the deep state.
[02:15:44.567 --> 02:15:50.694]  Chad Malik, former Davos board member group, head of the Aspen Institute, you name it.
[02:15:50.714 --> 02:15:54.658]  We're gonna give the number out too and take phone calls, but a lot of big stuff is breaking.
[02:15:54.678 --> 02:15:55.599]  We're covering it all.
[02:15:55.979 --> 02:15:57.201]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:57.461 --> 02:15:58.142]  Please stay with us.
[02:16:03.117 --> 02:16:04.699]  I want to apologize to listeners.
[02:16:05.661 --> 02:16:08.865]  I lied to you when I told you Trump would win the election, and he did.
[02:16:09.706 --> 02:16:13.992]  I lied to you when I told you that they're admitting that fluoride's causing brain damage, and it turned out I was right.
[02:16:14.573 --> 02:16:19.200]  I lied to you about a global government existing that was trying to take control of our country, which they now admit is true.
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.682]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:16:21.762 --> 02:16:24.205]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[02:16:24.545 --> 02:16:26.287]  I guess, actually, I didn't lie to you.
[02:16:26.867 --> 02:16:38.919]  And I'm on air every day fighting the globalists as they try to shut down free speech in America, as they try to derail our recovery, as they try to fold us into their world government, open up our borders, hand us over to the Islamic caliphate.
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:40.221]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:16:40.701 --> 02:16:48.507]  When I'm on air, I wear a sports jacket and a nice shirt because I respect the fact that you're tuning in and watching and listening to what I have to say.
[02:16:48.927 --> 02:16:51.509]  But we're involved in very, very important activities.
[02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:56.713]  And that's why I want to reach out to you right now and explain something that's so critical.
[02:16:57.174 --> 02:17:02.398]  And that if you grasp it, we'll be able to literally turn the tide even faster against the globalists.
[02:17:02.918 --> 02:17:03.479]  And it's just this.
[02:17:04.645 --> 02:17:07.767]  I'm not always wearing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:07.887 --> 02:17:23.138]  I dress like this to politically get messages out to folks that aren't awake, to spur debates, but to also meet like-minded people who are out there feeling like they're alone and don't know how many of us there are.
[02:17:23.758 --> 02:17:33.305]  It's like Martin Luther King said, it's all of us of one human race who all have incredible skills and gifts that God gave us that we bring together in the human family.
[02:17:34.105 --> 02:17:35.066]  You do incredible things.
[02:17:35.646 --> 02:17:42.151]  A few months ago, I saw media demonizing folks that put up signs at universities that said, all lives matter.
[02:17:42.932 --> 02:17:45.474]  Then they demonized people that said, it's okay to be white.
[02:17:46.929 --> 02:17:53.794]  These are universities where they're saying it's inherently evil and an abomination and satanic to be white.
[02:17:54.295 --> 02:17:55.536]  Right outside Austin, Texas.
[02:17:55.956 --> 02:17:57.257]  Texas State University says that.
[02:17:57.758 --> 02:18:03.802]  Most major universities are directing this to create racial division in this country and it's sickening.
[02:18:04.463 --> 02:18:06.424]  That's why I have designed with our crew
[02:18:07.385 --> 02:18:18.656]  Several new limited edition t-shirts that expose this evil and fight true institutional leftist based racial division and classical race war designs.
[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:23.203]  Yeah, if you're just talking about how you're white or how you're black, it's okay.
[02:18:23.643 --> 02:18:24.844]  That's fine to be proud of yourself.
[02:18:25.204 --> 02:18:28.426]  But isn't it really great to realize we all got red blood?
[02:18:28.666 --> 02:18:30.007]  That's why the shirt is in red.
[02:18:30.387 --> 02:18:38.453]  Out here in space together, the dark blue of the night sky, but all of our red blood together ties us together and that's what makes us great.
[02:18:38.733 --> 02:18:41.215]  The globalists are creating a fake debate to turn us against each other.
[02:18:41.515 --> 02:18:43.796]  Let's come together and say all lives matter.
[02:18:44.337 --> 02:18:48.720]  The fact is it's not just okay, it's great to be human.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.400]  Let me show you a few of the other designs we've got.
[02:18:51.881 --> 02:18:53.821]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:54.061 --> 02:18:56.642]  They help spread the word, and they help support the broadcast.
[02:18:56.882 --> 02:18:57.642]  A total win-win.
[02:18:58.242 --> 02:18:59.662]  This shirt is white.
[02:19:00.383 --> 02:19:00.723]  Whoa!
[02:19:01.463 --> 02:19:06.384]  And you've got major universities, major publications like BuzzFeed saying, is milk racist?
[02:19:06.824 --> 02:19:07.624]  Because it's white.
[02:19:08.224 --> 02:19:15.026]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's the white shirt that says it's okay to be white, okay to be black, okay to be brown, but it's great.
[02:19:15.566 --> 02:19:16.106]  To be human.
[02:19:31.454 --> 02:19:36.076]  To literally take minorities and turn them into the equivalent of Brown Ku Klux Klan.
[02:19:36.416 --> 02:19:39.818]  This shirt is amazing, it's iconic, and it's limited edition.
[02:19:40.118 --> 02:19:46.941]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:19:47.041 --> 02:20:01.108]  And despite the fact that all these shirts are super high quality and are destined to be best sellers, through Christmas, we're offering 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com on these limited edition shirts.
[02:20:04.773 --> 02:20:09.294]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:20.576 --> 02:20:22.176]  Happy Holiday!
[02:20:22.196 --> 02:20:23.096]  Happy Holiday!
[02:20:23.877 --> 02:20:25.457]  Happy Holiday!
[02:20:25.577 --> 02:20:26.457]  Happy Holiday!
[02:20:27.177 --> 02:20:31.558]  While the merry bells keep ringing, Happy Holiday!
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:58.874]  So, Jed Malik, how popular were you being a board member of the Davos Group?
[02:20:58.894 --> 02:21:06.000]  You know, over the years saying that the EU is the USSR and needs to fall apart and now we're starting to see that happen.
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:08.562]  I mean, what was it like when you were amongst those people saying that?
[02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:30.661]  Well, I wasn't saying it, frankly, when I was inside some of those organizations, but the further I got away from them, the more it became apparent to me, so therefore I came, you know, into the media and said those things, wrote articles about it, have written books about it, have given long lectures about it, so some of your former friends, you know, don't return your phone calls or probably have crossed you off their
[02:21:31.530 --> 02:21:32.412]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:21:44.736 --> 02:21:45.997]  What are the globalists going to do?
[02:21:46.017 --> 02:21:55.505]  Because again, they're mainly corporate groups that use government contracts and monopolies to expand power at the expense of everybody else and seek to create unified authoritarian monopolies.
[02:21:55.946 --> 02:22:00.009]  That's how I would describe their authoritarian command and control model.
[02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:03.932]  And they describe it as the technocracy that basically is doing the same thing.
[02:22:04.333 --> 02:22:09.097]  And they have fantasized about tech gods and population reduction and the rest of it.
[02:22:09.777 --> 02:22:13.821]  So it's just classic delusional behavior of these mega billionaires.
[02:22:14.482 --> 02:22:15.643]  But they're not going to go away.
[02:22:15.743 --> 02:22:22.069]  How are they going to reconstitute as more free market systems get brought back, as they're not just given monopolies?
[02:22:22.410 --> 02:22:23.471]  How are they going to strike back?
[02:22:24.111 --> 02:22:25.392]  Well, it is correct.
[02:22:25.412 --> 02:22:26.494]  They're not going away.
[02:22:26.794 --> 02:22:27.795]  They're not going to give up.
[02:22:28.295 --> 02:22:34.442]  They're still key players in the world, and their headquarters in effect is Brussels.
[02:22:34.502 --> 02:22:44.774]  So you're going to see more and more activity, whether it's Soros funded or EU funded, coming out of Western Europe, and they're going to try to use the international organizations
[02:22:45.754 --> 02:22:54.878]  Whether it's the Paris Climate Change Accord, or whether it's some UN body on migration, or some millennial goals.
[02:22:55.138 --> 02:23:01.660]  They'll use those same organizations, but if they're defunded and delegitimized, it's going to be harder to use them.
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:08.003]  They have less credibility, and the US is basically bailing on all those institutions thanks to Donald Trump.
[02:23:08.583 --> 02:23:13.025]  He hasn't even appointed yet an ambassador to the European Union.
[02:23:13.065 --> 02:23:13.765]  What does that say?
[02:23:17.679 --> 02:23:27.126]  It just shows how he's being blocked trying to put good people in the government, and there's this attempt to just stay in power and hold everything off just long enough to bring globalism back.
[02:23:27.146 --> 02:23:28.727]  But again, Trump's just a figurehead.
[02:23:29.127 --> 02:23:31.869]  Even if they could get rid of him, don't they understand the tide's turned against them?
[02:23:32.089 --> 02:23:34.311]  What does Peter Thiel get that they don't get?
[02:23:35.092 --> 02:23:42.957]  Well, I mean, Peter Thiel made this statement about globalism or globalization, which are not the same things, being on the uptide.
[02:23:43.017 --> 02:23:43.978]  It's going out.
[02:23:44.628 --> 02:23:52.375]  Well, you know, sometimes tides come back in, so we have to be ready and willing and able to challenge them on the return tide.
[02:23:52.715 --> 02:23:55.097]  But this is an ongoing battle.
[02:23:55.157 --> 02:23:57.539]  This is something that's going to last our lifetimes.
[02:23:57.639 --> 02:24:02.503]  It's not a short-term episode, so we have to be prepared to do that.
[02:24:02.603 --> 02:24:03.845]  By the way, I did find the video.
[02:24:04.245 --> 02:24:04.845]  It's right there.
[02:24:05.106 --> 02:24:08.308]  Yeah, it's John McCain Passes Dossier to Make Trump Look Bad.
[02:24:08.569 --> 02:24:09.629]  You're at 205 on the video.
[02:24:10.310 --> 02:24:10.871]  We're going to get that.
[02:24:10.891 --> 02:24:14.094]  We're going to get your BBC one, too, where you talked about all that.
[02:24:14.114 --> 02:24:18.800]  Because I just, I've got to have this OCD thing now where if I want a clip, I've got to have it or I go crazy.
[02:24:19.541 --> 02:24:21.503]  But this is insane, all the stuff that's happening.
[02:24:21.543 --> 02:24:22.985]  So much good things are happening.
[02:24:23.305 --> 02:24:26.489]  I've been upset about the Russia thing because they've said I'm a Russian agent with no proof.
[02:24:26.789 --> 02:24:27.790]  They've had congressional hearings.
[02:24:27.810 --> 02:24:28.310]  You've seen them.
[02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:30.971]  Three or four of them where they say, don't worry, we're censoring him.
[02:24:30.991 --> 02:24:31.771]  He's a Russian agent.
[02:24:32.132 --> 02:24:33.532]  That's very evil, folks.
[02:24:33.552 --> 02:24:34.473]  That's very corrupt.
[02:24:34.733 --> 02:24:37.814]  They told Rand Paul, hey, you're a Russian agent on the floor of the Senate.
[02:24:37.834 --> 02:24:38.495]  John McCain did.
[02:24:38.515 --> 02:24:39.335]  Speaking of John McCain.
[02:24:40.015 --> 02:24:44.858]  They've said whenever Tucker Carlson says there's no proof, they go, oh, there you are working for Putin.
[02:24:46.118 --> 02:24:48.579]  But, I mean, Putin is bringing sovereignty back to Russia.
[02:24:48.619 --> 02:24:50.300]  He is trying to get them to have children again.
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:51.661]  He is trying to reform.
[02:24:51.721 --> 02:25:11.310]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but, you know, it is true that he is trying to be a man in a world where men were told they're bad by these mega-technocrats that don't want any leaders there to stand up against their global takeover that is a bunch of evil men with billions of dollars apiece using psychology and sociology to break down society.
[02:25:12.057 --> 02:25:15.259]  I went on Russian television, RT television, a couple times.
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:17.821]  We have very good studios, very good broadcasters.
[02:25:17.841 --> 02:25:19.643]  They didn't tell me what I had to say.
[02:25:19.663 --> 02:25:21.624]  I said exactly what I wanted to say.
[02:25:21.644 --> 02:25:27.829]  The first thing I said, I want to make it absolutely clear, I had no Russian salad dressing on my salad at lunch.
[02:25:29.673 --> 02:25:32.697]  But we had a very, you know, kind of good conversation.
[02:25:33.078 --> 02:25:36.242]  And I don't think we should be Russophiles or Russian folks.
[02:25:36.282 --> 02:25:40.387]  We should learn to find a way to deal with Russia into the future.
[02:25:40.567 --> 02:25:41.248]  Pragmatically.
[02:25:41.348 --> 02:25:43.191]  And it's not the old Soviet Union.
[02:25:43.211 --> 02:25:46.455]  The EU, like you said, they're the ones that behave like the Soviet Union.
[02:25:46.575 --> 02:25:46.996]  You got it.
[02:25:47.895 --> 02:25:53.479]  The toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen, is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[02:25:53.639 --> 02:26:03.126]  And it specifically questions, for Ted Malek, about globalism, the Davos Group, the New World Order, Donald Trump, where he sees all this going.
[02:26:03.146 --> 02:26:09.530]  I want to get into George Soros and the funding that's left for the Democrats and the globalists, because the Saudis are not funding them now.
[02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:11.892]  They had that weird thing you said, like Bono, last week.
[02:26:12.771 --> 02:26:17.273]  Well, you still have some very rich people who are throwing money in the wrong direction.
[02:26:35.274 --> 02:26:44.281]  I say that if, and I do like and have been on the boards of many big foundations, in the first generation they do a lot of good, in the second generation they deviate slightly.
[02:26:44.321 --> 02:26:50.946]  By the third generation, some of these places become nothing like what they were intended to be in the first instance.
[02:26:51.326 --> 02:26:58.432]  And the founders, who are of course long dead now, would say, what are you doing with this money that I left in this charitable organization?
[02:26:58.472 --> 02:27:00.814]  And we can go down the list, it happens almost every time.
[02:27:02.055 --> 02:27:04.577]  And most of the modern leftist stuff is like,
[02:27:05.561 --> 02:27:13.511]  Deviants and just defacing beautiful art, destroying families, attacking manhood, attacking true feminist prowess.
[02:27:14.032 --> 02:27:16.996]  I mean, why are they attacking strength and beauty?
[02:27:18.317 --> 02:27:23.284]  Well, because they are total relativists and they don't have any understanding of what truth is.
[02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:30.495]  Objectively, how one deals rationally with the world, and they have this very nihilistic view.
[02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:32.717]  So, this is becoming more and more.
[02:27:32.737 --> 02:27:34.458]  I mean, when you think about our educational system... They're evil.
[02:27:34.918 --> 02:27:36.099]  I have been in the university.
[02:27:36.139 --> 02:27:38.220]  This is what is prevailing in the university.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:40.902]  So, they're a reflection of that part of our culture.
[02:27:41.502 --> 02:27:46.546]  I would say that's an even longer-term battle, taking back the culture.
[02:27:47.026 --> 02:27:52.831]  I was about to say, if we could just get our sovereignty back, it doesn't mean we're going to be perfect, but at least we've got a system that doesn't have to destroy everybody.
[02:27:53.072 --> 02:27:54.673]  There's some social contract left.
[02:27:54.893 --> 02:27:59.738]  But the big fight is the screen sickness, the TVs, the media, the culture, the breakup of the family.
[02:28:00.098 --> 02:28:07.505]  Even though we defeat the globalist minions, the fourth generation, the problem is it's like a perpetual motion machine.
[02:28:07.905 --> 02:28:09.207]  The juggernaut still rolls on.
[02:28:10.049 --> 02:28:13.112]  And these globalists are radically against the family.
[02:28:13.172 --> 02:28:16.276]  I mean, you see everything that they do to eradicate the family.
[02:28:16.336 --> 02:28:18.879]  I mean, I wrote an article, you know, a few months ago.
[02:28:18.899 --> 02:28:20.400]  I think it was in Breitbart.
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:24.325]  It appeared about the, you know, the tragedy of the European family.
[02:28:24.505 --> 02:28:30.752]  There are now 17 leaders of European countries and the EU who have no children.
[02:28:32.059 --> 02:28:32.880]  What does that tell you?
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:41.566]  Let's talk about that with Ted Malik, the guy that's been on the board of the Davos Group, head of the Aspen Institute, doesn't get any more elite than that, and here he is telling you everything.
[02:28:41.766 --> 02:28:49.791]  I want to get into Soros, take phone calls, the attack on the family, why the EU heads don't have children, what is this cult, and I want to get into the Luciferianisms.
[02:28:49.811 --> 02:28:52.193]  We were having some discussions last night about that.
[02:28:52.213 --> 02:28:56.456]  I mean, just the mindset, the spirit, the ghost in the globalist machine.
[02:28:56.836 --> 02:28:57.797]  What is its endgame?
[02:28:58.097 --> 02:28:59.458]  What is its operating system?
[02:28:59.558 --> 02:29:00.259]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:02.318 --> 02:29:02.679]  Have you?
[02:29:03.843 --> 02:29:05.248]  Welcome to the War Room!
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:08.841]  The latest addition to InfoWars live programming.
[02:29:09.001 --> 02:29:11.421]  The War Room is live weekdays, 3 to 6 p.m.

[02:29:22.304 --> 02:29:23.604]  Subscribe for notifications.
[02:29:24.284 --> 02:29:35.727]  Owen Schroer and Roger Stone bring you the day's biggest stories, as well as the latest breaking news, with a no-holds-barred, aggressive approach and commitment to bringing you the most cutting-edge analysis and information.
[02:29:37.853 --> 02:29:41.574]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[02:29:42.034 --> 02:29:44.755]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[02:29:45.275 --> 02:29:47.516]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[02:29:48.036 --> 02:29:49.717]  And we control the narrative now.
[02:29:51.077 --> 02:29:57.839]  This is the War Room.
[02:29:57.859 --> 02:30:03.001]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:30:03.301 --> 02:30:05.162]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:30:05.182 --> 02:30:05.502]  Go ahead.
[02:30:06.429 --> 02:30:08.331]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:30:08.371 --> 02:30:17.778]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:30:18.879 --> 02:30:22.242]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:30:22.702 --> 02:30:22.962]  Absolutely.
[02:30:45.472 --> 02:30:58.390]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:31:03.098 --> 02:31:06.981]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:31:07.521 --> 02:31:14.927]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:31:15.627 --> 02:31:20.331]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:31:20.951 --> 02:31:22.852]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:31:23.473 --> 02:31:26.895]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:31:27.716 --> 02:31:30.178]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:31:31.254 --> 02:31:37.498]  Protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:31:38.098 --> 02:31:45.343]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:31:46.203 --> 02:31:52.847]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:31:53.428 --> 02:31:54.528]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:31:54.909 --> 02:31:56.710]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:31:57.530 --> 02:32:00.471]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.832]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:03.192 --> 02:32:06.713]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:32:07.174 --> 02:32:13.236]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:32:13.456 --> 02:32:16.417]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:16.797 --> 02:32:19.818]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:32:19.998 --> 02:32:23.460]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:24.240]  The left
[02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:25.541]  ...controls culture.
[02:32:25.561 --> 02:32:26.541]  They control arts.
[02:32:26.601 --> 02:32:27.842]  They control entertainment.
[02:32:28.142 --> 02:32:35.226]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:32:35.266 --> 02:32:37.667]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:32:38.168 --> 02:32:42.030]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:50.154]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:32:50.414 --> 02:32:53.096]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[02:32:53.516 --> 02:32:56.657]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:32:56.717 --> 02:32:58.418]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:32:58.578 --> 02:32:59.758]  It's available right now.
[02:33:00.059 --> 02:33:02.640]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:07.522]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.784 --> 02:33:21.047]  If it's not fake news, and we don't know... Let me tell you what the British intelligence told me this morning.
[02:33:21.147 --> 02:33:21.407]  Okay.
[02:33:22.737 --> 02:33:25.660]  This person, who they know, who was an M.I.C.
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:26.521]  This is Mr. Steele?
[02:33:26.621 --> 02:33:38.173]  It is Christopher Steele, was also an FBI asset at one point in time, so he has intelligence background, but he was paid by the people that you mentioned, who were working for Jeb Bush.
[02:33:39.234 --> 02:33:43.177]  In order to discredit him, the Democrats took over the contract, as you said.
[02:33:43.197 --> 02:33:50.182]  He kept adding to the dossier and using information given to him by the FSB in Russia.
[02:33:50.843 --> 02:33:52.084]  Most of it fabricated.
[02:33:52.424 --> 02:33:54.986]  The more he put into the dossier, the more he got paid.
[02:33:55.466 --> 02:34:03.412]  So he made a sensationalist dossier, as bad as possible, just like your lawyer charges you more billable hours in order to get paid more.
[02:34:03.872 --> 02:34:05.433]  You said most of it fabricated.
[02:34:05.473 --> 02:34:06.694]  What bit wasn't fabricated?
[02:34:06.734 --> 02:34:08.616]  I don't know what's fabricated and what's not.
[02:34:08.636 --> 02:34:10.998]  So you don't know if most of it's fabricated?
[02:34:11.018 --> 02:34:17.383]  Well, I mean, the stuff that we've read, the salacious stuff that we've read... So some of it might be true?
[02:34:17.683 --> 02:34:20.405]  Well, it is true that Mr. Trump was in Moscow.
[02:34:21.946 --> 02:34:24.468]  So that's Ted Malik, who's in the studio with us right now.
[02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:28.972]  That was right after Trump was elected in the middle of November last year.
[02:34:29.032 --> 02:34:40.761]  So we're talking 13 months ago, and we're talking bombshell because now the author of the PPGate fiction piece has now admitted that, oh, well, some of it's true, but most of it's not.
[02:34:41.382 --> 02:34:43.403]  So this is absolutely massive.
[02:34:43.824 --> 02:34:51.330]  Now that we know the FBI took it, knew it was a fraud, got fake warrants, this is just simply incredible.
[02:34:53.641 --> 02:35:01.415]  And this is the cornerstone of the whole case against the presidency of Donald Trump.
[02:35:01.696 --> 02:35:04.781]  And it's just a blatant lie.
[02:35:04.822 --> 02:35:05.383]  It's a fiction.
[02:35:06.264 --> 02:35:07.124]  And we've run with it.
[02:35:07.144 --> 02:35:08.385]  The media has run with it.
[02:35:08.485 --> 02:35:09.665]  The left has run with it.
[02:35:09.825 --> 02:35:11.886]  All these NGOs run with it.
[02:35:13.326 --> 02:35:15.267]  It just has to be exposed for what it is.
[02:35:15.427 --> 02:35:24.389]  By the way, you talked about at dinner last night how important it was that Dina Powell and these other globals be removed because she's the one bringing in all these Obama people and others.
[02:35:24.429 --> 02:35:26.210]  She's now stepping down.
[02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:28.110]  That's been reported by the Washington Post today.
[02:35:29.651 --> 02:35:31.071]  But we also talked about
[02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:51.071]  Soros and the funding that the Saudis being taken out, the arm that's been funding the Democrats and these particular princes, that that's another reason the Democrats are in so much crisis is their black money, their secret money that they pay for fake dossiers and things is drying up.
[02:35:52.403 --> 02:35:53.884]  Well, I believe it to be the case.
[02:35:53.964 --> 02:36:10.532]  So, they were highly dependent on both certain left-wing billionaires who, you know, find some new faith on the left, I guess, after they've made their money, which is an iron in and of itself, or foreign governments
[02:36:11.132 --> 02:36:20.201]  You know, in the case of Turkey, the Gulenists have funded certainly lots of congressional campaigns on the Democrat side, given $14 million to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:36:20.501 --> 02:36:35.736]  The Clinton Foundation, I really want to repeat this, Charles Altel, of course, is the great analyst on that foundation, and you should look at his website and what he writes about, but that is really the cesspool of the whole, whole operation on the left.
[02:36:36.256 --> 02:36:43.238]  And how much money has basically flowed through that one organization and what they've been able to do with it.
[02:36:43.459 --> 02:36:48.860]  And Newt Gingrich makes really good points when he says they thought Hillary was going to be in office.
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:52.962]  They were just wildly taking billions of dollars from a whole bunch of countries.
[02:36:53.262 --> 02:36:54.542]  It wasn't a Russian conspiracy.
[02:36:54.562 --> 02:36:56.663]  I'm not a Russophile, as you're saying, or you're not either.
[02:36:56.863 --> 02:36:57.363]  Just the facts.
[02:36:57.623 --> 02:37:00.384]  The communists, Chinese, the EU, all these foreign companies.
[02:37:00.704 --> 02:37:02.265]  I mean, it was a clearinghouse.
[02:37:02.785 --> 02:37:06.286]  She had the server as a dropbox, knowing they were all on it, grabbing it.
[02:37:06.566 --> 02:37:09.066]  They'd give her money, she'd put the stuff on the server.
[02:37:09.086 --> 02:37:11.927]  That's what my FBI sources tell me, and now that's coming out.
[02:37:11.967 --> 02:37:13.347]  I mean, the nakedness.
[02:37:13.367 --> 02:37:14.947]  But I guess if you're gonna steal, steal big.
[02:37:15.628 --> 02:37:16.908]  Oh, they certainly stole big.
[02:37:16.968 --> 02:37:17.748]  I made a list.
[02:37:18.188 --> 02:37:25.169]  Actually, I wrote an article on the greatest kleptocracies in the history of the world, and I listed 13 of them, and I think the Clintons are in the top three.
[02:37:25.509 --> 02:37:28.330]  So it's really, what they achieved was really unprecedented.
[02:37:28.971 --> 02:37:44.981]  I mean, not just taking $500,000 here or there for a speech, or in her case, $600,000 for three speeches telling people how much she loves and is one of Goldman Sachs, but taking $145 million to do a deal to sell uranium to the Russians?
[02:37:45.281 --> 02:37:50.464]  I mean, it's just... And then have the nerve to claim anybody that loves America is a Russian agent when you're on the payroll.
[02:37:50.945 --> 02:37:52.566]  Oh, I mean, much more the case.
[02:37:52.586 --> 02:37:54.367]  Well, every time I've talked to President Trump,
[02:37:56.024 --> 02:37:56.624]  I just warn him.
[02:37:56.684 --> 02:37:58.386]  I say, listen, they're never going to back down.
[02:37:58.406 --> 02:37:59.207]  They're never going to give up.
[02:37:59.227 --> 02:38:00.288]  They're going to keep coming after you.
[02:38:00.308 --> 02:38:01.269]  You've got to go after them.
[02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:04.673]  And I mean, obviously, Trump doesn't need my advice on that front.
[02:38:04.713 --> 02:38:05.233]  But here's the deal.
[02:38:05.514 --> 02:38:09.518]  We're not being vengeful about the Clintons and these people, but they need to go to prison.
[02:38:10.158 --> 02:38:14.783]  I mean, they need to pay so other people learn you don't get away with this crap.
[02:38:15.104 --> 02:38:17.026]  The fear of God needs to be in these people.
[02:38:17.708 --> 02:38:25.376]  Well, we are a country of law, so, you know, we shouldn't have people that are outside or above the law, regardless of political office.
[02:38:25.396 --> 02:38:27.458]  So, there should have been already.
[02:38:27.538 --> 02:38:37.888]  I mean, I really can't believe that there isn't a special prosecutor or a special counsel to look into all these evils and sins of the past administration, where there was meetings on the tarmac
[02:38:38.548 --> 02:38:49.174]  In, you know, Phoenix, Arizona, whether it was the server, whether it was the uranium deal, I mean, we just need to see the truth on all this and the Congress has not been able to unearth it.
[02:38:49.434 --> 02:38:52.235]  So let's get a special prosecutor and put it under a microscope.
[02:38:52.455 --> 02:38:59.299]  There's no reason why our Attorney General should either recuse himself or hesitate from doing that.
[02:39:00.677 --> 02:39:03.179]  You know, when I was a kid growing up, I didn't know what God-fearing meant.
[02:39:03.239 --> 02:39:04.360]  As I get older, I realize what it means.
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:05.881]  It's not that God's evil or bad.
[02:39:05.941 --> 02:39:09.263]  It's that you have respect for God, God's laws, and common sense.
[02:39:09.303 --> 02:39:13.686]  You've seen how, when people don't follow common sense and natural law, they get destroyed.
[02:39:14.226 --> 02:39:15.967]  So, it's not even a fear.
[02:39:16.048 --> 02:39:16.828]  It's a respect.
[02:39:17.348 --> 02:39:19.070]  And I've noticed these globalists are all
[02:39:20.177 --> 02:39:44.642]  Really hateful psychopaths, sociopaths, control freaks, neurotics, some of them aren't occultic, some of them are, but a lot of them, it's like in the WikiLeaks, you know, they're talking about all this Aleister Crowley stuff, and you realize what a pathetic group looking for power, even if you don't believe in God or the devil, I do, in an archetype of the devil, and you literally find out their mascot's the devil, even if they don't really believe it.
[02:39:45.422 --> 02:40:06.557]  They get into the nastiness of the rituals and doing bad things, and it's just like, I know you, we talked about it at dinner, we talked about it here, I don't know how much you want to talk about, but, and your associate that was here talking about some of the top folks in the country they work with, and just how it's like you can't swing a stick without running into a Luciferian, and again, they're not a devil worshipper, they think the devil's God.
[02:40:06.597 --> 02:40:08.278]  Can you speak to that and get in some real trouble?
[02:40:09.266 --> 02:40:11.068]  Well, yeah, now you open the gate.
[02:40:11.088 --> 02:40:12.670]  I mean, this is radical evil.
[02:40:12.730 --> 02:40:29.968]  So, these are individuals who have largely divorced themselves from any kind of normal religion, but they've had to fill the void in their lives and in their interpersonal dealings, and they've looked at either Satan or the occult,
[02:40:30.652 --> 02:40:34.715]  And they've begun to worship false gods, false idols.
[02:40:35.316 --> 02:40:43.882]  And a lot of it, of course, has to do with their own political power, with their own greed and accumulation of money and material.
[02:40:44.343 --> 02:40:49.567]  But they've been actually harsh critics, then, of those of us on the right,
[02:40:50.208 --> 02:40:52.289]  Who still practice traditional religion?
[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:55.932]  And here I'm not trying to suggest we should become theocratic.
[02:40:56.472 --> 02:41:00.675]  I mean, I believe firmly in the First Amendment and the freedom of conscience.
[02:41:00.695 --> 02:41:02.095]  Well, there are no atheists and foxholes.
[02:41:02.256 --> 02:41:04.337]  I know God's real.
[02:41:04.417 --> 02:41:07.559]  I can feel the force of good, and I can feel the force of evil.
[02:41:09.315 --> 02:41:33.233]  And to some degree, I would say, if you want to understand globalism, you need to get at the spiritual bearings, the spiritual underlying currents in globalism, which is not only relativistic, but it's a divorce, a great divorce from religion and from any notion that there is a God who exists or that you could know him personally.
[02:41:33.613 --> 02:41:34.194]  They would like
[02:41:34.854 --> 02:41:41.160]  Actually, and of course Western Europe is a place where fewer than three or four percent of people have any religious tradition anymore.
[02:41:41.661 --> 02:41:51.570]  They would like to move the rest of the world away from their traditional bearings, from their traditional cultures, from their traditional scriptures.
[02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.971]  And why is that?
[02:41:53.011 --> 02:41:54.973]  To replace it with whatever they want.
[02:41:55.053 --> 02:41:57.195]  It's a power trip to end free will.
[02:41:57.595 --> 02:41:58.116]  Absolutely.
[02:41:58.846 --> 02:42:00.187]  And who will be in charge then?
[02:42:00.587 --> 02:42:10.033]  Unelected bureaucrats, who we call experts, really aren't that experts, who pull over on the rest of the population what they want to do.
[02:42:10.493 --> 02:42:12.775]  And there's no democracy left in the end.
[02:42:13.335 --> 02:42:14.956]  There's no faith left in the end.
[02:42:15.497 --> 02:42:18.258]  There's just one gray monolithic state.
[02:42:20.100 --> 02:42:20.660]  That's what they want.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:21.801]  They don't want real diversity.
[02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:23.822]  Oh, it's not about diversity.
[02:42:24.262 --> 02:42:24.743]  Not at all.
[02:42:25.223 --> 02:42:28.447]  If they like diversity, they like the differences in European countries.
[02:42:29.108 --> 02:42:33.593]  They want to homogenize that and make it all one color of gray.
[02:42:34.774 --> 02:42:37.197]  We're gonna come back and go bam, bam, bam, Zach of...
[02:42:38.621 --> 02:42:43.085]  Army Special Forces Command, and now in Morocco, so you can even talk to us.
[02:42:43.565 --> 02:42:46.588]  Zach is called in, and he is an amazing source.
[02:42:47.028 --> 02:42:56.836]  We've got Kevin, we've got Shabazz, we've got Josh, we've got Brent, we've got Lauren, we've got John, we've got Matt, we've got a lot of folks, and I've got a feeling, if you can do it, we're going to go a little bit in the next hour, but you need to get some lunch as well.
[02:42:57.237 --> 02:42:58.418]  But we'll be right back, folks.
[02:42:58.438 --> 02:42:59.599]  Stay with us, infowars.com.
[02:43:02.602 --> 02:43:06.923]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:43:07.403 --> 02:43:12.444]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:43:12.984 --> 02:43:16.905]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:43:16.925 --> 02:43:20.246]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:43:20.906 --> 02:43:25.347]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:43:25.987 --> 02:43:29.247]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:43:29.928 --> 02:43:31.468]  I came in here an hour ago.
[02:43:32.228 --> 02:43:39.450]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[02:43:39.770 --> 02:43:43.571]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:43:44.151 --> 02:43:47.632]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[02:43:47.992 --> 02:43:49.693]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[02:43:50.133 --> 02:43:56.455]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:56.515 --> 02:43:57.415]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:43:57.955 --> 02:43:59.477]  This is verified by our Mark.
[02:43:59.657 --> 02:44:02.600]  Five-star review for Anthroplex is for men and women.
[02:44:03.101 --> 02:44:04.142]  I take it as directed.
[02:44:04.162 --> 02:44:15.015]  As is one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[02:44:15.595 --> 02:44:16.275]  Easy does it.
[02:44:16.355 --> 02:44:17.376]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:44:17.396 --> 02:44:18.336]  It's very, very serious.
[02:44:18.756 --> 02:44:19.156]  Not a game.
[02:44:19.196 --> 02:44:19.656]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:21.417]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:44:21.537 --> 02:44:22.317]  Energy all day.
[02:44:22.337 --> 02:44:30.059]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:44:30.499 --> 02:44:31.220]  Another review.
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:32.220]  I love this one.
[02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:34.981]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:44:35.341 --> 02:44:38.882]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:44:39.142 --> 02:44:42.063]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:44:42.463 --> 02:44:43.985]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:44.366 --> 02:44:47.731]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:51.196]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:44:51.276 --> 02:44:56.003]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:44:56.143 --> 02:44:57.104]  Amazing product.
[02:44:57.905 --> 02:44:59.906]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:44:59.926 --> 02:45:01.346]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:45:01.647 --> 02:45:03.747]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:45:03.867 --> 02:45:04.688]  Thank you all.
[02:45:05.088 --> 02:45:08.749]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:11.030]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:45:11.430 --> 02:45:13.371]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:45:13.871 --> 02:45:17.312]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:45:17.552 --> 02:45:18.213]  And I should add,
[02:45:19.013 --> 02:45:20.154]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:45:20.394 --> 02:45:22.235]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:45:22.255 --> 02:45:23.956]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:45:24.296 --> 02:45:25.637]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:45:25.717 --> 02:45:27.318]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:45:27.358 --> 02:45:27.918]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:45:28.159 --> 02:45:28.919]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:45:29.759 --> 02:45:30.600]  But back to the script.
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:32.821]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:45:32.861 --> 02:45:33.602]  I love that name too.
[02:45:34.022 --> 02:45:36.063]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:45:36.363 --> 02:45:40.566]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:45:40.606 --> 02:45:43.168]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:45:43.228 --> 02:45:44.648]  You make it literally possible.
[02:45:45.709 --> 02:45:50.515]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million, colloidal silver out there.
[02:45:51.055 --> 02:45:53.878]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:45:54.159 --> 02:45:57.723]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:45:58.243 --> 02:46:00.446]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though.
[02:46:00.666 --> 02:46:03.948]  So, I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:46:04.288 --> 02:46:06.390]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:46:06.730 --> 02:46:12.594]  Whenever I feel the first traces of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:46:13.014 --> 02:46:18.758]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[02:46:19.238 --> 02:46:25.643]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[02:46:25.903 --> 02:46:26.703]  It's all a win-win.
[02:46:26.884 --> 02:46:27.764]  That's an awesome review.
[02:46:27.824 --> 02:46:30.606]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[02:46:31.026 --> 02:46:33.068]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:46:33.148 --> 02:46:36.090]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:37.311]  They're all five-star.
[02:46:37.551 --> 02:46:42.915]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:46:43.555 --> 02:46:46.838]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:46:47.138 --> 02:46:48.939]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.762]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:52.782 --> 02:46:57.846]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:47:04.392 --> 02:47:07.094]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:22.301 --> 02:47:24.482]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:47:25.062 --> 02:47:27.403]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.564 --> 02:47:29.864]  Yeah, my job's easy.
[02:47:30.365 --> 02:47:34.426]  I'll tell you, I'm lazy when it comes down to things of the heart and soul.
[02:47:34.887 --> 02:47:35.687]  I mean, sarcastic.
[02:47:36.107 --> 02:47:39.789]  I just go with what I believe is right and what stands for justice.
[02:47:40.349 --> 02:47:42.710]  And if it's dangerous, hell, that makes it exciting.
[02:47:43.330 --> 02:47:44.471]  I'm kind of a thrill seeker.
[02:47:45.211 --> 02:47:47.392]  And I'm not going to roll over and be somebody else's man.
[02:47:48.112 --> 02:47:49.393]  I'm going to do what's right.
[02:47:49.813 --> 02:47:51.114]  And Ted Malik's done that as well.
[02:47:51.174 --> 02:47:58.037]  And he really is trailblazed inside the globalist combine, exposing it to the point of being thrown out of it.
[02:47:58.477 --> 02:48:06.981]  And boy, is it not sweet justice to see capitalism, Americana, populism exploding.
[02:48:07.181 --> 02:48:09.182]  We're going to take phone calls this segment and a few more.
[02:48:09.242 --> 02:48:10.382]  Mike Cernovich is joining us.
[02:48:11.102 --> 02:48:12.143]  We've got Zach.
[02:48:12.563 --> 02:48:17.984]  Who we were talking about at dinner last night, formerly with Army Special Forces Command out of Florida.
[02:48:18.424 --> 02:48:21.465]  The FBI did pick him up, take him to a base last time he was on.
[02:48:22.805 --> 02:48:26.626]  He broke down, what really went on from my sources as well, at Vegas.
[02:48:26.646 --> 02:48:33.487]  So we've got Zach we're going to in a moment, who had to go to Morocco, where his mother lives, just didn't be able to call us, but any other points you'd like to add?
[02:48:34.668 --> 02:48:40.289]  Well I do want to say, because it's the thesis that I've been writing about most recently, that we also
[02:48:41.235 --> 02:48:42.656]  And I think Trump is very good at this.
[02:48:42.696 --> 02:48:44.417]  We have to defend capitalism again.
[02:48:44.457 --> 02:48:47.079]  We have to go on the offensive about capitalism.
[02:48:47.499 --> 02:48:54.084]  Because in Europe, the reigning ideology, the reigning economic domain is socialism.
[02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:55.665]  And we have to challenge it.
[02:48:56.205 --> 02:49:00.808]  In the UK, the opposition party, the Labour Party, is led by a Trotskyite.
[02:49:01.308 --> 02:49:10.094]  If May's government falls, which is very weak, we will have a socialist Trotskyite Prime Minister of Great Britain, our most important ally.
[02:49:11.135 --> 02:49:22.744]  So we have to understand that this is still a battle that we're involved in between capitalism and socialism on the economic zone, on the economic sphere.
[02:49:22.984 --> 02:49:29.669]  And if you look at it parliamentary-wise, people think, well, if Merkel almost lost, then how is socialism stronger?
[02:49:29.689 --> 02:49:35.573]  Well, now, basically, the communists are coming in, the coalition now supporting her to prop her up, but that gives them more power.
[02:49:35.914 --> 02:49:38.536]  So to stay in power, the left's gotten even more extreme.
[02:49:39.156 --> 02:49:39.716]  Same thing here.
[02:49:40.237 --> 02:49:42.658]  What are they going to extract in the German situation?
[02:49:42.718 --> 02:49:46.021]  This new grand coalition is with the Social Democratic Party.
[02:49:46.321 --> 02:49:53.285]  They're going to move the Merkel government, which teetered, obviously, you know, couldn't put together another coalition, to the left.
[02:49:53.766 --> 02:49:59.269]  And the demand is going to be, they've already stated yesterday, a United States of Europe.
[02:49:59.790 --> 02:50:02.632]  Getting away with the nation-state, doing away with the nation-state.
[02:50:02.652 --> 02:50:04.313]  Yeah, like, oh, by the way, you can't leave now.
[02:50:04.773 --> 02:50:10.114]  They're playing that game, and they're going to play it hard and fast in order to keep Merkel in power.
[02:50:10.615 --> 02:50:12.255]  Historically, that doesn't go too well.
[02:50:13.255 --> 02:50:13.415]  No.
[02:50:13.895 --> 02:50:18.137]  And Germany is the lead country in Europe, so what happens in Germany actually matters.
[02:50:18.217 --> 02:50:21.077]  Not just the German economy, but they have an inordinate power.
[02:50:21.257 --> 02:50:28.299]  The entire euro currency, which is a phony currency to begin with, is basically contrived to help Germany.
[02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:30.540]  The German elites.
[02:50:32.159 --> 02:50:33.420]  You think it helps the average German too?
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:34.420]  I think so.
[02:50:34.801 --> 02:50:36.542]  The average German has done very well.
[02:50:39.063 --> 02:50:46.348]  What's crazy is the EU is literally a Nazi construct idea of Juncker's grandfather and now he's the head of it.
[02:50:48.029 --> 02:51:01.577]  Well, about 40 years ago there was a minister in Margaret Thatcher's great government who said at that point in time that the European Union is basically a scheme to prop up Germany.
[02:51:02.452 --> 02:51:04.974]  And he used the Hitler word, which of course you're not allowed to use.
[02:51:05.434 --> 02:51:07.456]  He was dismissed from Thatcher's government.
[02:51:08.156 --> 02:51:11.099]  The same can be true, or said to be true today.
[02:51:12.099 --> 02:51:14.021]  The EU was a Nazi idea.
[02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:19.391]  It predates, certainly, its founding after the war.
[02:51:19.431 --> 02:51:26.112]  The whole genesis of the European Union came, frankly, after the First World War.
[02:51:26.772 --> 02:51:30.293]  Why is he still in control of Luxembourg when his grandfather took it by force?
[02:51:31.093 --> 02:51:33.234]  I mean, what the hell's going on with this unelected Joker?
[02:51:34.554 --> 02:51:37.955]  Well, this is the whole definition of the European political system.
[02:51:37.975 --> 02:51:39.055]  You don't have to elect
[02:51:39.922 --> 02:51:42.025]  Uh, you know, your leaders, you just appoint them.
[02:51:42.325 --> 02:51:47.932]  Even the Director Generals of the different sectors in the European Union are not elected, they're just appointed.
[02:51:47.992 --> 02:51:51.156]  So where Napoleon and Hitler failed, they're succeeding?
[02:51:52.397 --> 02:51:53.298]  Until we bring them down.
[02:51:54.239 --> 02:51:58.424]  But this will be the third round of EU-European expansion.
[02:51:59.073 --> 02:52:00.214]  Well, they have expanded.
[02:52:00.334 --> 02:52:07.318]  There are other countries in the east of Europe that may want to go into that European Union, and they should be advised, I think, against that.
[02:52:07.958 --> 02:52:10.220]  I'm proud of Eastern Europe standing strong.
[02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:21.186]  Oh, yeah, no, the Poles and the Czechs and the Hungarians are really, I would say, giving the forces in Brussels more than a headache these days.
[02:52:21.246 --> 02:52:23.748]  I saw just yesterday... Well, they know when something's taking them over.
[02:52:23.948 --> 02:52:30.895]  Well, they just said yesterday there's going to be a court case to force those countries to take asylum seekers.
[02:52:31.175 --> 02:52:33.217]  They're saying we can't integrate them into our countries.
[02:52:33.297 --> 02:52:34.258]  We don't want those.
[02:52:34.278 --> 02:52:35.018]  That's what's crazy.
[02:52:35.058 --> 02:52:36.960]  Some people say if the U.S.
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:40.984]  doesn't come back, the only thing Western's left Russia, and it's not even really Western.
[02:52:41.024 --> 02:52:41.645]  It's its own thing.
[02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:44.471]  That tells you the crisis in the West right there.
[02:52:44.891 --> 02:52:45.151]  Yes.
[02:52:45.712 --> 02:52:57.157]  So we talked about Western Civilization, and I think we need to basically, certainly starting at a very young age, start to teach our students again about Western Civilization.
[02:52:58.238 --> 02:53:03.060]  In the case of Europe, they've actually lost touch with their foundation.
[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:03.601]  Their ethos.
[02:53:04.181 --> 02:53:12.087]  Their entire cultural ethos, the foundations of Western civilization, which is actually Greco-Roman-Judeo-Christian.
[02:53:12.127 --> 02:53:12.907]  They've lost it.
[02:53:13.968 --> 02:53:15.369]  That's incredible diversity, by the way.
[02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:15.769]  Yeah.
[02:53:16.369 --> 02:53:24.155]  Because the West took stuff from the East, you know, and it's all, that's what the West was, it was true, true melting pot of ideas.
[02:53:24.235 --> 02:53:29.719]  That's what's so powerful about the West, is it, it is diverse, it does grab ideas, its language is big, you know.
[02:53:30.305 --> 02:53:39.774]  Well, it's also the place where all innovation, you know, has been centered, where technology started, where we had the basis of economics, where we had the foundation of law.
[02:53:39.995 --> 02:53:47.382]  All of these things were rooted in that Western culture, and we want to just wash our hands of it and say, well, let's have multiculturalism.
[02:53:50.185 --> 02:53:54.787]  When it's not even multiculturalism, it's globalism, a synthetic system of enslavement.
[02:53:55.308 --> 02:53:57.049]  It is very synthetic, to say the least.
[02:53:57.089 --> 02:53:59.310]  But let's talk- Let's go to the calls, absolutely.
[02:53:59.470 --> 02:54:03.692]  Briefly, folks, support the broadcast, don't fight the crowds, don't fight the traffic.
[02:54:04.032 --> 02:54:04.852]  Infowarsstore.com, 50% off.
[02:54:05.993 --> 02:54:06.213]  Thank you.
[02:54:25.003 --> 02:54:31.084]  Out of the gates at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com and your funding makes it all possible, so I salute you.
[02:54:31.444 --> 02:54:32.985]  We're not winning, but we're turning the tide.
[02:54:33.025 --> 02:54:35.445]  We could win, so thanks for supporting us.
[02:54:35.465 --> 02:54:40.746]  888-253-3139, Alpha Power, the latest product, and I think it'll be our best seller overall.
[02:54:40.786 --> 02:54:42.247]  It is just crazy powerful.
[02:54:42.267 --> 02:54:51.048]  I mean, I said with top formulators, I want the ultimate sports enhancement, energy, libido, and I just, the ton of money went into this.
[02:54:51.648 --> 02:54:53.849]  The amount of product in it and the purity.
[02:54:54.569 --> 02:54:57.432]  The LJ100 and all the rest of it is just look out.
[02:54:58.272 --> 02:54:58.873]  Alpha power.
[02:54:59.193 --> 02:55:02.076]  All right, let's go to Zach in Morocco.
[02:55:02.856 --> 02:55:03.897]  Zach is his real name.
[02:55:04.498 --> 02:55:12.325]  He's been in the Special Operations and Intelligence, put out information the last six months, where he's been picked up and sent to military bases.
[02:55:12.365 --> 02:55:13.886]  So he's now left the U.S.
[02:55:13.906 --> 02:55:16.228]  We'll see what Zach has to say from Morocco.
[02:55:16.268 --> 02:55:17.089]  Zach, what's the latest?
[02:55:18.310 --> 02:55:22.853]  First and foremost, it's a pleasure to be on with you gentlemen, so happy Friday and it's a beautiful day to be alive.
[02:55:22.974 --> 02:55:26.796]  With that being said, I have a couple dots to connect here.
[02:55:28.237 --> 02:55:30.319]  Some very interesting information coming out.
[02:55:30.579 --> 02:55:35.923]  First and foremost, a lot of people could do this intel, but let's look at Barack Obama following the footsteps of Trump globally.
[02:55:36.363 --> 02:55:38.705]  Immediately following his China trip, he's in country.
[02:55:38.805 --> 02:55:41.507]  Immediately following his India trip, he's in country.
[02:55:41.647 --> 02:55:44.569]  Three or four days later, after the administration and Secret Service leaves.
[02:55:45.149 --> 02:55:54.634]  So, Barack Obama has kind of been off the radar, even via social media, but make no mistake, he's making his rounds around the world to try to cover whatever bases he can.
[02:55:54.875 --> 02:55:58.456]  And the reason why this is important is because of this point.
[02:55:59.257 --> 02:56:13.085]  Let us not lose sight of the deep state and ISI-backed Awan brothers, who were in Congress and the Senate with their IT working, if you would call it that, which was essentially a cover for blackmailing tactics.
[02:56:15.325 --> 02:56:18.747]  You know, this is Debbie Washman Schultz, this is HRC, this is everything.
[02:56:19.147 --> 02:56:27.470]  And now I can say with full confidence, with the shakeup going on in the DOJ via FBI, that this is all coming down, crashing soon.
[02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.790]  It's all coming down.
[02:56:29.311 --> 02:56:34.453]  And Rand Paul, who's as active as anybody is in the Senate, knew this.
[02:56:34.893 --> 02:56:40.835]  Had the Awant Brother information, had the intel, and obviously we haven't heard from him since he was attacked in his own home.
[02:56:42.359 --> 02:56:43.760]  Disgustingly in Kentucky.
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:45.040]  And I have a couple more points.
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:46.360]  Six of his ribs broken.
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:47.740]  Yeah, this is a total psyop.
[02:56:48.241 --> 02:56:50.941]  And again, you're totally on target with everything you just laid out.
[02:56:51.581 --> 02:56:55.662]  Obama is acting as the shadow president with the shadow government saying, don't listen to him, we're about to take him out.
[02:56:56.182 --> 02:57:01.464]  Getting world leaders lined up and ready for Trump to be killed or removed, as they've said they're going to do in December.
[02:57:01.584 --> 02:57:04.124]  We'll see if they do it, but they've been saying they are.
[02:57:05.725 --> 02:57:07.285]  So this is a hell of a time to be alive.
[02:57:08.092 --> 02:57:09.913]  So this is the big connection.
[02:57:09.933 --> 02:57:18.058]  Our attention span has become so short and evaporated due to everything that's going on, but let us not lose focus of the Iwan brothers.
[02:57:18.438 --> 02:57:21.020]  You know, they worked for upwards of a hundred individuals.
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:22.020]  Let's be clear.
[02:57:22.141 --> 02:57:24.002]  Obama and the globalists use Islamic...
[02:57:24.827 --> 02:57:28.570]  Outside groups as muscle for their attempt to take over the U.S.
[02:57:28.871 --> 02:57:30.672]  And we still have those stay-behind networks connected.
[02:57:30.732 --> 02:57:34.675]  So when we come back in one minute, I'm going to ask Zach then why you're getting into the Awan Brothers.
[02:57:34.696 --> 02:57:35.476]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:57:35.736 --> 02:57:43.643]  The Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabian funding, Muslim muscle has been used by the traitorous Democrats and their attempt to take over with Hillary.
[02:57:43.663 --> 02:57:44.384]  That failed.
[02:57:44.804 --> 02:57:47.787]  We've got to deal with the stay-behind networks at the same time.
[02:57:48.107 --> 02:57:49.068]  Ted Malek is our guest.
[02:57:49.088 --> 02:57:49.508]  Stay with us.
[02:57:49.548 --> 02:57:50.229]  Zach, straight ahead.
[02:57:52.853 --> 02:57:55.135]  Merry Christmas my fellow InfoWarriors!
[02:57:55.795 --> 02:58:05.082]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[02:58:06.023 --> 02:58:19.093]  I know from using this myself the last few months and from seeing my friends and family use it that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product at InfoWarsLife.com because it works so well.
[02:58:19.633 --> 02:58:21.555]  It is Alpha Power.
[02:58:22.745 --> 02:58:36.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, AlphaPow is so strong, so concentrated, that quite frankly a lot of you might want to use some of the other products we've previously come out with that are excellent but aren't anywhere as strong.
[02:58:37.222 --> 02:58:40.986]  It's hard to quantify the stamina, the energy, the libido.
[02:58:41.767 --> 02:58:43.869]  The crazed mental focus.
[02:58:44.310 --> 02:58:45.150]  But let me just say this.
[02:58:45.931 --> 02:58:46.992]  Use this with care.
[02:58:47.693 --> 02:58:53.058]  And alpha power works synergistically with super male vitality and super female vitality.
[02:58:53.278 --> 02:58:53.999]  But I want to be clear.
[02:58:54.740 --> 02:58:56.461]  We could have called this formula something like...
[02:58:57.482 --> 02:58:59.384]  Alpha Male or Alpha Man?
[02:58:59.804 --> 02:59:06.048]  No, it's Alpha Power because it has incredible effects in women as well.
[02:59:06.448 --> 02:59:25.361]  Ladies and gentlemen, God gave us some incredible gifts through Mother Nature and Alpha Power, I know, is going to end up probably being our number one bestseller at InfoWarsLife.com and helping you with your stamina, your life, and certainly has done that for me and so many others, and also funding the Information War Against the Globe.
[02:59:25.481 --> 02:59:26.722]  So, Alpha Power.
[02:59:27.242 --> 02:59:33.788]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com, right in time to be under the tree or in the stocking.
[02:59:34.348 --> 02:59:43.156]  This is a gift you want to give yourself, and then rest assured, you're fighting the Info War, so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.
[02:59:43.656 --> 02:59:45.578]  But again, don't believe me?
[02:59:45.878 --> 02:59:51.003]  Try Alpha Power, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com for yourself.
[02:59:55.245 --> 02:59:59.327]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.847 --> 03:00:01.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.329 --> 03:00:04.909]  We've got it.
[03:00:04.929 --> 03:00:11.372]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:00:11.452 --> 03:00:13.533]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.453 --> 03:00:15.554]  Alright, you are a ghost.
[03:00:15.834 --> 03:00:17.254]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.835 --> 03:00:21.536]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:22.837 --> 03:00:23.577]  We are ghosts.
[03:00:25.655 --> 03:00:26.856]  We see the earth from here.
[03:00:27.776 --> 03:00:30.617]  We got it.
[03:00:31.257 --> 03:00:31.978]  All right, Zach.
[03:00:32.538 --> 03:00:33.558]  I'm gonna finish up with you.
[03:00:33.618 --> 03:00:34.819]  I'm glad you were able to call in.
[03:00:34.839 --> 03:00:37.500]  I was just talking to Ted about you last night during the break.
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:40.541]  I mean, you've done nothing wrong, but the stuff you know is what they're scared of.
[03:00:41.261 --> 03:00:45.764]  Exposing the Vegas stuff that we were already on the trail of and getting into what's happening globally.
[03:00:46.344 --> 03:00:49.866]  I see desperate fundraising by Bono for Obama.
[03:00:50.366 --> 03:00:52.067]  I see their networks being rolled up.
[03:00:52.547 --> 03:00:53.908]  I see them in crisis mode.
[03:00:53.948 --> 03:00:59.151]  I see them now going after all the people with the whole fake investigation of Trump.
[03:00:59.171 --> 03:01:01.732]  I mean, I think we're starting to really smell victory in the air.
[03:01:01.752 --> 03:01:02.413]  What do you think, Zach?
[03:01:03.719 --> 03:01:05.080]  I absolutely concur.
[03:01:05.220 --> 03:01:12.022]  And whether or not we get small victory, make no mistake, the second American Revolution is in full engagement as we speak.
[03:01:12.543 --> 03:01:18.905]  And the reason I bring up that first point is that speaks to several individuals who know what I'm talking about and people who could do their own research there.
[03:01:19.505 --> 03:01:25.007]  But the point being is that the establishment and the power brokers for the last, I would say, 20 to 25 years
[03:01:26.328 --> 03:01:27.188]  We're good to go.
[03:01:49.759 --> 03:01:53.602]  It's a path he loosens to protect himself and to cover his own behind.
[03:01:53.963 --> 03:01:55.564]  But, um, that's gone.
[03:01:55.804 --> 03:01:56.465]  That's long gone.
[03:01:56.545 --> 03:02:01.509]  Sure, so also you think to get intel on what Trump told world leaders so they can cover their ass?
[03:02:01.529 --> 03:02:01.509]  100%.
[03:02:02.650 --> 03:02:10.077]  And what you have to understand, especially within these other countries, I mean, the legitimate helms of those countries, the legitimate helms, are going to fall in line.
[03:02:10.117 --> 03:02:16.963]  They can see the power that Trump's... What do you make of the Secret Service calling me three days ago and saying we were ordered by Washington and then they were like,
[03:02:17.663 --> 03:02:32.254]  Shaken and it was one of these guys I know well, and they said we know we know it's real We're investigating the people who else you want to tell us about it wasn't an investigation of me It was real and they seemed freaked out and then what I mean, what do you think that was?
[03:02:33.329 --> 03:02:37.090]  Quite frankly, I concur and I salute them because the writing's on the wall and we're going to move forward.
[03:02:37.690 --> 03:02:45.331]  I salute Matt Bracken as well, who made it very well known yesterday or a couple days ago when I was watching, talking about foreign and or domestic, okay?
[03:02:45.752 --> 03:02:51.013]  So, you know, they think they're on this, you know, they're on a power high, they're literally out of their mind, but they're gone and it's over.
[03:02:51.493 --> 03:02:57.654]  And, you know, the underestimation of what the Trump administration is doing is, it's going to be deadly and this will be historic.
[03:02:58.374 --> 03:03:07.297]  I was about to say, if they try violence and actually launch their anti-fascist thing that they backed off on, the word is they know to back off, it's gonna be BAM.
[03:03:07.337 --> 03:03:10.578]  I mean, the military, the army, all of it's ready to crush them.
[03:03:10.999 --> 03:03:12.219]  Didn't happen, didn't occur.
[03:03:12.239 --> 03:03:13.920]  I mean, we were all anticipating it.
[03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:14.720]  You talked about it.
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:16.020]  It didn't come to fruition.
[03:03:16.381 --> 03:03:17.301]  They're trying to raise money.
[03:03:17.321 --> 03:03:18.701]  They're having a hard time raising money.
[03:03:19.182 --> 03:03:22.123]  This Obama trailing is a very interesting phenomenon, I would say.
[03:03:22.163 --> 03:03:22.823]  He's also
[03:03:23.363 --> 03:03:24.284]  You know, very popular.
[03:03:24.344 --> 03:03:26.585]  He could be the next president of Europe if he ran.
[03:03:27.065 --> 03:03:30.868]  But he's out fundraising for his own foundation.
[03:03:31.949 --> 03:03:33.690]  Watch the Obama Foundation.
[03:03:35.551 --> 03:03:39.014]  I completely concur, and that's exactly what's going on.
[03:03:39.094 --> 03:03:57.889]  But, you know, when you have a billionaire and an individual like Donald J. Trump, who was going to foresee his presidency, and not many other individuals did besides Nipaw Wars and several other individuals there, but when you have a Donald Trump who knew he was going to ran several years with foresight, bringing up the Barack Obama birth certificate, because I could tell you, I don't care.
[03:03:57.909 --> 03:03:59.310]  It's well known who I am.
[03:03:59.330 --> 03:04:01.952]  Listen, I'm going to tell you right now, and the stuff I've been involved in,
[03:04:02.532 --> 03:04:03.954]  That birth certificate is phony.
[03:04:04.234 --> 03:04:05.255]  We know where he's from.
[03:04:05.315 --> 03:04:06.637]  We know the whole situation.
[03:04:07.317 --> 03:04:09.019]  And this has been going on generationally.
[03:04:09.319 --> 03:04:10.441]  So this is the foresight.
[03:04:10.461 --> 03:04:11.161]  This is deeper.
[03:04:11.502 --> 03:04:14.345]  We can't just look at a surface level mainstream media perspective.
[03:04:15.326 --> 03:04:24.856]  You're basically saying Obama was supposed to be the Mahdi and the globalist version of an Islamist leader to like destroy the West and destroy Islam at the same time?
[03:04:25.712 --> 03:04:45.036]  If the Abraco because put it this way that it was the DNC that was going to run the White House even if Hillary was there ceremonially it was the Obama family and him at the helm as the individual you have sharing with you there was correct he could be the you know the king or the ruler of Europe however you want to look at it because it was it was it was going to go for a new world order this was what was going to happen but there's no coincidence that Bitcoin
[03:04:47.199 --> 03:04:47.779]  It is, it is.
[03:04:47.859 --> 03:04:48.880]  Alright, stay there.
[03:05:04.321 --> 03:05:05.042]  I'm so excited.
[03:05:05.122 --> 03:05:14.668]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[03:05:15.268 --> 03:05:20.452]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:20.772 --> 03:05:23.574]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:23.774 --> 03:05:32.540]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:34.661 --> 03:05:53.758]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:54.258 --> 03:05:55.539]  It is amazing!
[03:05:56.941 --> 03:06:01.905]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:19.557 --> 03:06:20.978]  We now take you live.
[03:06:21.338 --> 03:06:27.423]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:29.344]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.624 --> 03:06:32.466]  We now take you live to the collapse of the globalists.
[03:06:33.327 --> 03:06:34.808]  We've still got to build a civilization.
[03:06:35.568 --> 03:06:38.871]  Ted Malek's our guest, board member of the Davos Group, head of the...
[03:06:39.824 --> 03:06:42.624]  Aspen Institute, previously best-selling author, researcher.
[03:06:43.185 --> 03:06:45.365]  One of his great books is Davos, Aspen, and Yale.
[03:06:45.385 --> 03:06:48.565]  Got his latest book on business, TedMalik.com.
[03:06:48.586 --> 03:06:49.326]  Everybody should get it.
[03:06:49.706 --> 03:06:55.987]  We got the great Mike Cernovich, one of the biggest investigative journalists of the last 20 years, just in the last year, dominating.
[03:06:56.327 --> 03:06:58.827]  He's gonna be co-hosting with us, but Zach, I got a bunch of callers.
[03:06:59.127 --> 03:07:00.107]  I've been bad to the callers.
[03:07:00.127 --> 03:07:07.749]  I'm gonna run through them quick, and then turn it over to Mike Cernovich, who always is nice and lets me hog him when he hosts the Fourth Hour on Fridays.
[03:07:08.289 --> 03:07:08.529]  Zach,
[03:07:09.470 --> 03:07:10.112]  We know who you are.
[03:07:10.152 --> 03:07:11.175]  We know you're a great source.
[03:07:11.195 --> 03:07:12.279]  Don't give us anything classified.
[03:07:12.299 --> 03:07:14.366]  You're just giving us your citizen's view of things.
[03:07:14.687 --> 03:07:16.212]  What was the other point you wanted to make real quick?
[03:07:17.784 --> 03:07:19.645]  Yeah, absolutely, and I just got to get to this one.
[03:07:20.666 --> 03:07:26.329]  I'll let the researchers look into this, but there's no Awan Brothers without the Huma-Abedin connection.
[03:07:26.449 --> 03:07:31.792]  Huma is the Barack Hussein source, has nothing to do with HRC.
[03:07:31.812 --> 03:07:45.479]  She has a taste for women, so that gets pretty creepy and weird, but make no mistake, the connection is Huma and Hussein, and Hussein is Barack O. And the reason I'm making this call is because of the active threats that are potentially out there this weekend.
[03:07:46.019 --> 03:07:48.400]  At the embassies around our world that happen to be U.S.
[03:07:48.980 --> 03:07:49.700]  and stateside.
[03:07:49.921 --> 03:07:51.361]  And that's the reason I'm making this call.
[03:07:51.421 --> 03:07:54.262]  You know the kind of trouble I've been in and stuff.
[03:07:54.322 --> 03:07:56.663]  But at this point, this is the Second American Revolution.
[03:07:56.683 --> 03:07:58.604]  And I do call you from the Kingdom of Morocco.
[03:07:59.104 --> 03:08:03.646]  And I also challenge your guests to look up the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship that was signed in 1786.
[03:08:04.686 --> 03:08:07.507]  Morocco was the first country to recognize the United States of America.
[03:08:07.987 --> 03:08:09.148]  That was signed by John Adams.
[03:08:09.828 --> 03:08:11.088]  That was signed by John Adams.
[03:08:11.448 --> 03:08:12.829]  That was signed by Thomas Jefferson.
[03:08:13.439 --> 03:08:16.200]  Okay, so the big connection is the Huma Abedin, Barack Obama connection.
[03:08:16.220 --> 03:08:16.901]  There are active threats.
[03:08:16.921 --> 03:08:21.182]  When we see the capital moving in Israel, this was understood that it would cause unrest.
[03:08:42.935 --> 03:08:48.037]  This is a hand being played in a very, very elaborate game of poker.
[03:08:48.298 --> 03:08:50.579]  We understand that the unrest would come.
[03:08:50.759 --> 03:08:52.880]  We understand that there would be a threat.
[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:55.141]  But we're here.
[03:08:55.501 --> 03:08:58.442]  We're facing it, and it's not going to faze us.
[03:08:59.042 --> 03:09:00.383]  Something may happen this weekend.
[03:09:01.364 --> 03:09:02.704]  Sure, it's meant to flesh it out.
[03:09:02.764 --> 03:09:04.265]  You want the confrontation, you're gonna get it.
[03:09:05.177 --> 03:09:05.877]  And it's getting it.
[03:09:06.098 --> 03:09:07.038]  And this is year one.
[03:09:07.078 --> 03:09:09.119]  Make no mistake, this is year one of the presidency.
[03:09:09.439 --> 03:09:14.141]  The reason I'm making the call, the reason I'm connecting these dots, is I have faith in the Trump administration.
[03:09:14.161 --> 03:09:15.122]  I have faith in the presidency.
[03:09:15.182 --> 03:09:16.202]  I have faith in the country.
[03:09:16.702 --> 03:09:20.404]  And there is an active threat right now, stateside and embassies around the world do.
[03:09:20.504 --> 03:09:24.106]  It will be blamed on Donald Trump for moving the embassy.
[03:09:24.846 --> 03:09:28.548]  But, you know, we're not going to have something held over our head and be threatened constantly.
[03:09:28.568 --> 03:09:30.869]  Sure, it's been intimidation.
[03:09:30.889 --> 03:09:31.569]  It's been terrorism.
[03:09:32.796 --> 03:09:41.343]  When you see the leader of India, an established country with over a billion people there, falling into the arms of Donald Trump, why do you think that is?
[03:09:42.364 --> 03:09:45.766]  Because Pakistan, the Awan brothers, Huma, they're not in the White House.
[03:09:46.647 --> 03:09:47.508]  They are mortal enemies.
[03:09:48.288 --> 03:09:52.872]  So when you have the Indian president falling into the arms of our current leader,
[03:09:53.698 --> 03:09:58.539]  This is the most symbolic image that if you don't see the writing on the wall, you won't understand.
[03:09:58.819 --> 03:09:59.919]  But there's a reason for that.
[03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:01.500]  That affects everything else.
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:02.980]  Zach, stay in contact.
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:03.440]  Be safe.
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:03.960]  Amazing.
[03:10:04.561 --> 03:10:06.061]  Ted Malek, then we're going to bring in Cern.
[03:10:06.081 --> 03:10:06.961]  What's your take on this?
[03:10:07.801 --> 03:10:09.502]  It's very, very, very keen insight there.
[03:10:09.542 --> 03:10:11.822]  I listen to him all day long.
[03:10:11.862 --> 03:10:16.783]  I think he's on the tip there of a number of things that are happening.
[03:10:17.344 --> 03:10:23.085]  But the whole world is changing to realign with the presidency of Donald Trump.
[03:10:25.470 --> 03:10:26.371]  America is special.
[03:10:27.252 --> 03:10:27.892]  In destiny.
[03:10:30.375 --> 03:10:36.020]  It has been since the very first appearance of Americans on the shore.
[03:10:37.101 --> 03:10:40.304]  And it is a city on a hill.
[03:10:40.404 --> 03:10:42.806]  So we were just walking by a wonderful
[03:10:43.675 --> 03:10:43.935]  I think he's
[03:11:05.043 --> 03:11:07.284]  Really, they're realizing their will is broken right now.
[03:11:07.604 --> 03:11:09.865]  Mike Cernovich, you've always got huge breaking news.
[03:11:10.246 --> 03:11:11.466]  Ed Cernovich, right there on Twitter.
[03:11:11.486 --> 03:11:12.327]  Everybody should follow you.
[03:11:12.347 --> 03:11:13.607]  You've got a lot to cover here.
[03:11:13.627 --> 03:11:17.629]  I'm going to ride shotgun and take a few calls where I can ditch these poor callers I've been holding like great folks.
[03:11:17.649 --> 03:11:19.830]  Shabbat and Kevin and Lauren and Josh.
[03:11:19.850 --> 03:11:21.411]  But you've always got huge breaking news.
[03:11:21.811 --> 03:11:26.874]  What do you make of Dana Powell leaving all this?
[03:11:27.194 --> 03:11:28.414]  You've always got the cutting edge.
[03:11:28.654 --> 03:11:29.215]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:11:30.335 --> 03:11:37.179]  Dina Powell was the source of the article about Rex Tillerson, which ended up Trump had to call it out as fake.
[03:11:37.559 --> 03:11:39.080]  So here's what happened with Dina Powell.
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:40.081]  Nobody else knows it.
[03:11:40.121 --> 03:11:42.362]  Well, a couple people do, but it hasn't been reported.
[03:11:43.103 --> 03:11:49.006]  She planted a fake story with the New York Times and other outlets about how Rex Tillerson was out.
[03:11:49.606 --> 03:11:58.769]  Dina Powell thought then she could move Nikki Haley to Secretary of State, and then Dina would take over as the United States Ambassador to the UN.
[03:11:59.509 --> 03:12:08.893]  After her little chess game and power play failed, then she saw the handwriting on the wall, and she has also been a leaker for the entire year, so that's why she left.
[03:12:10.453 --> 03:12:12.014]  Mike Cernovich always has the exclusive.
[03:12:12.354 --> 03:12:14.775]  What other giant exclusives do you have for us, Mike Cernovich?
[03:12:15.935 --> 03:12:18.796]  Well, I mean, you know, we got them warmed up, but that's the truth about
[03:12:19.491 --> 03:12:20.473]  Paul, I'm warmed up.
[03:12:20.493 --> 03:12:23.699]  I mean, today, today there's so much going on, man.
[03:12:23.819 --> 03:12:30.350]  The Roy Moore video, Yearbooks of Forgery, and so I want to apologize to you, Alex, and to NFL Wars.
[03:12:30.390 --> 03:12:32.855]  I owe you all a big apology, so as a man, I'll own it.
[03:12:33.656 --> 03:12:36.778]  I said, Alex, you're crazy, it isn't two signatures.
[03:12:37.198 --> 03:12:39.660]  You know, I was like, we can't do conspiracy theories.
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:50.127]  So, and I told that to many listeners and viewers, so I would just like to apologize to everybody listening, everybody watching, and to you personally, that you guys were right on that and I was wrong.
[03:12:50.707 --> 03:12:53.909]  All I remember, we just reported that he was saying it was fake, they looked different.
[03:12:53.989 --> 03:12:55.991]  I mean, I wasn't like betting the farm on it.
[03:12:57.759 --> 03:13:00.582]  You guys were right though, and I dismissed it outright.
[03:13:00.842 --> 03:13:02.243]  So I have to own that.
[03:13:02.283 --> 03:13:08.209]  As a journalist, you know what I've learned about people is they're all right if you get it wrong, but you own it and you admit it.
[03:13:08.289 --> 03:13:12.453]  But what they hate is what the fake news media does, which they never own their mistakes.
[03:13:12.513 --> 03:13:14.175]  I mean, it was a forgery, Alex.
[03:13:14.235 --> 03:13:19.680]  I mean, this is the world we live in now where they will fabricate evidence against us to bring us down.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:20.821]  And then the media
[03:13:21.983 --> 03:13:28.191]  CNN said that anybody who says these signatures might be fake is a conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:28.572 --> 03:13:29.833]  This is actually what they said.
[03:13:29.853 --> 03:13:32.437]  They go, oh, you can't even, you can't even ask that question.
[03:13:32.457 --> 03:13:33.838]  You can't even examine a signature.
[03:13:34.179 --> 03:13:35.541]  Well, they didn't do a very good job.
[03:13:35.641 --> 03:13:37.123]  It looks like two different handwritings.
[03:13:38.413 --> 03:13:39.193]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:13:39.493 --> 03:13:45.315]  And that just goes to show that even I am still, in a way, a victim of the fake news brainwashing.
[03:13:45.355 --> 03:13:47.835]  Well, nobody can be perfect in the middle of this.
[03:13:47.875 --> 03:13:50.136]  Half the time, I don't know what end is up.
[03:13:50.536 --> 03:13:51.236]  So, Mike, you're nice.
[03:13:51.256 --> 03:13:52.216]  I don't even really remember that.
[03:13:52.236 --> 03:13:54.557]  I remember us saying it might be fake and you questioning it.
[03:13:54.857 --> 03:13:56.457]  But we're not running a cult here.
[03:13:56.797 --> 03:13:58.998]  Paul Watson agrees with me a lot of the time.
[03:13:59.038 --> 03:14:00.018]  He disagrees a lot of the time.
[03:14:00.338 --> 03:14:01.438]  But I know we're all good people.
[03:14:01.458 --> 03:14:03.599]  We're all good actors here trying to figure out the truth.
[03:14:03.859 --> 03:14:04.279]  Ted Mallet?
[03:14:05.526 --> 03:14:08.387]  Yeah, I mean, I said the same thing about that signature.
[03:14:08.787 --> 03:14:10.028]  I thought it was probably written.
[03:14:10.048 --> 03:14:15.330]  I mean, if you do the kind of analysis, forensic analysis that you would have to do, they were unwilling to do it.
[03:14:15.370 --> 03:14:16.290]  So what does that say?
[03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:23.093]  But if you do that analysis, then you might even see that the handwriting was basically done in the last year.
[03:14:23.973 --> 03:14:25.834]  And it's a yearbook from decades ago.
[03:14:26.034 --> 03:14:26.274]  Exactly.
[03:14:26.294 --> 03:14:27.354]  They can study the ink.
[03:14:27.794 --> 03:14:29.515]  I mean, people know how to do this.
[03:14:29.635 --> 03:14:30.915]  I don't know how to do it.
[03:14:31.056 --> 03:14:32.416]  They got an electron microscope.
[03:14:32.436 --> 03:14:33.677]  They look at it and know what it is.
[03:14:33.777 --> 03:14:34.197]  Science.
[03:14:35.077 --> 03:14:36.359]  Let the scientists look at it.
[03:14:36.399 --> 03:14:37.900]  I mean, let them have a look.
[03:14:38.761 --> 03:14:40.383]  You know, I've not harassed any women.
[03:14:40.443 --> 03:14:41.725]  I don't have any weird skeletons.
[03:14:41.765 --> 03:14:45.429]  But I just wonder what the new jack-in-the-box thing is going to be.
[03:14:45.469 --> 03:14:47.471]  Because they've been going after everybody.
[03:14:47.511 --> 03:14:51.316]  And clearly we predicted this whole Weinstein thing was just to get after Trump.
[03:14:51.336 --> 03:14:52.297]  They now admit that, Mike.
[03:14:53.852 --> 03:14:56.293]  Yeah, they're now trying to actually frame us.
[03:14:56.694 --> 03:15:05.878]  So my wife and daughter have been receiving a lot of threats from the far-left media, and then when I defend myself from the threats, they're now saying that I'm harassing them.
[03:15:06.259 --> 03:15:08.340]  So we live... I mean, Alex, I...
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:13.903]  I just don't know what to say other than the media has become no different than a domestic terrorist arm.
[03:15:14.183 --> 03:15:15.324]  They attack our families.
[03:15:15.364 --> 03:15:16.725]  They attack everybody close to us.
[03:15:16.765 --> 03:15:17.485]  They lie about us.
[03:15:18.105 --> 03:15:19.686]  They frame people for crimes.
[03:15:20.167 --> 03:15:29.572]  They fail to report material things like General Flynn was framed for obstructing justice because, as we now know, the FBI agent who did the interviews was in the bag for Hillary.
[03:15:29.672 --> 03:15:31.153]  And now the judge is recused.
[03:15:31.873 --> 03:15:32.694]  Mike Cernovich is taking over.
[03:15:32.794 --> 03:15:33.395]  I apologize.
[03:15:33.495 --> 03:15:38.038]  Every caller on hold gets a free t-shirt or Alpha Power, whatever they want.
[03:15:38.058 --> 03:15:39.439]  I apologize to them.
[03:15:39.499 --> 03:15:40.700]  Ted Malik, thanks for all the time.
[03:15:41.041 --> 03:15:41.741]  It's been amazing.
[03:15:42.041 --> 03:15:43.042]  TedMalik.com.
[03:15:43.102 --> 03:15:44.083]  I can't wait to have you back on.
[03:15:44.383 --> 03:15:46.365]  Mike Cernovich is taking over and get out of his way.
[03:15:46.685 --> 03:15:47.546]  Great job of the crew.
[03:15:47.626 --> 03:15:50.208]  I'll be back with David Knight this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:15:50.228 --> 03:15:50.708]  Ward Willing.
[03:15:51.028 --> 03:15:51.989]  And the War Room's coming up.
[03:15:52.410 --> 03:15:53.430]  All right, he's coming up.
[03:15:53.470 --> 03:15:53.991]  Stay with us.
[03:15:54.011 --> 03:15:54.611]  Spread the links.
[03:15:54.932 --> 03:15:55.712]  Spread the articles.
[03:15:55.752 --> 03:15:56.833]  That's an act of resistance.
[03:15:57.594 --> 03:15:58.995]  We have Mike Cernovich coming up.
[03:16:02.717 --> 03:16:07.448]  My friends, we're in the middle of the second American revolution.
[03:16:08.591 --> 03:16:12.119]  The globalist social engineers are trying to play us off against each other.
[03:16:13.078 --> 03:16:13.679]  In a big way.
[03:16:13.699 --> 03:16:22.405]  They're trying to play us off according to race, according to region, according to ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, male, female.
[03:16:23.066 --> 03:16:36.656]  That's why this Christmas, it is more important than ever to support InfoWars because you're supporting yourself and you can beat the crowds, beat the traffic, beat the high prices, beat the garbage, beat the additives.
[03:16:37.961 --> 03:16:48.071]  And get, from the biggest budget to the lowest budget, high-quality products that you, your family, your friends, your loved ones, that those that you're giving gifts need.

[03:17:11.506 --> 03:17:18.208]  If you'll just do some of your Christmas shopping for your loved ones at InfoWarsTore.com, don't shop with the globalists.
[03:17:18.589 --> 03:17:20.669]  Don't trade with the enemy as much as you can.
[03:17:20.969 --> 03:17:24.851]  You can also give InfoWarsTore gift cards to friends and family.
[03:17:25.211 --> 03:17:31.619]  That's a great way to get them to visit the site and find out about the political message while they're getting high quality products at the same time.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:41.951]  And we also now have Patriot Points where you get 5% off of every purchase added to your account for future purchases.
[03:17:42.011 --> 03:17:42.472]  That is a
[03:17:43.012 --> 03:17:47.354]  High-end system at 5% compared to most rewards cards.
[03:17:47.534 --> 03:17:50.916]  That is on the very high end of the spectrum for the level of 5%.
[03:17:51.656 --> 03:17:56.259]  So please, do your Christmas shopping at InfoWareStore.com and help fund the Tip of the Spear against the Globalist.

[03:18:00.721 --> 03:18:02.402]  So, Merry Christmas and thanks for the support.
[03:18:06.914 --> 03:18:07.815]  Let's talk to Danny.
[03:18:07.835 --> 03:18:08.696]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[03:18:08.716 --> 03:18:09.397]  You're on the air, Danny.
[03:18:09.798 --> 03:18:10.018]  Hi.
[03:18:10.118 --> 03:18:15.105]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[03:18:15.125 --> 03:18:15.445]  Thank you.
[03:18:15.465 --> 03:18:24.437]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[03:18:24.537 --> 03:18:37.588]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[03:18:37.668 --> 03:18:46.956]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[03:18:47.356 --> 03:18:51.540]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[03:18:52.180 --> 03:18:53.981]  And it reboots itself.
[03:18:54.082 --> 03:18:56.523]  So, I mean, think about that.
[03:18:56.903 --> 03:19:08.371]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[03:19:08.451 --> 03:19:09.152]  Let me be clear.
[03:19:09.272 --> 03:19:16.417]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[03:19:17.097 --> 03:19:21.904]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[03:19:21.944 --> 03:19:22.785]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[03:19:23.106 --> 03:19:26.330]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[03:19:26.691 --> 03:19:28.072]  I took DNA for it for a few months.
[03:19:28.173 --> 03:19:29.354]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[03:19:29.675 --> 03:19:30.676]  The feeling is back.
[03:19:30.856 --> 03:19:32.519]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[03:19:32.599 --> 03:19:34.161]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[03:19:34.401 --> 03:19:44.871]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[03:19:44.931 --> 03:19:47.153]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[03:19:47.233 --> 03:19:49.435]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[03:19:49.495 --> 03:19:52.437]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[03:19:52.477 --> 03:19:54.359]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[03:19:54.379 --> 03:19:59.364]  We run in like six months and free shipping, store wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:08.501]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.285 --> 03:20:23.006]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.406 --> 03:20:26.387]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:20:27.367 --> 03:20:30.388]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:20:33.528 --> 03:20:34.048]  And we're back.
[03:20:34.509 --> 03:20:37.570]  Mike Cernovich, facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich.
[03:20:38.331 --> 03:20:41.672]  Let's go into a little bit more about the Dina Powell thing.
[03:20:41.692 --> 03:20:44.294]  So I retweeted a couple of tweets to my timeline.
[03:20:44.874 --> 03:20:49.116]  So to the fake news media, they're very surprised that Dina Powell has left.
[03:20:49.636 --> 03:20:54.539]  But if you read my tweets, and that's why I put them at the very top of my timeline so people can find them.
[03:20:55.599 --> 03:20:58.941]  Dina had been plotting a coup against Tillerson for a while.
[03:20:59.401 --> 03:21:00.442]  So Dina wanted
[03:21:01.207 --> 03:21:05.711]  Dina wanted to be the US-UN ambassador, which Nikki Haley has.
[03:21:07.012 --> 03:21:17.621]  The plan was that if Tillerson were out, then Nikki Haley would take over for Tillerson, and then Dina would slide in from the NSC over to US-UN.
[03:21:18.302 --> 03:21:25.648]  That's why that story, that big story broke a week or two ago, where they said Trump and Tillerson hate each other, and Tillerson's out.
[03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:29.988]  Well, then Trump tweeted out, no, I mean, actually, that's fake news, that's a lie.
[03:21:30.008 --> 03:21:32.348]  So that was all a Dina Powell coup.
[03:21:33.528 --> 03:21:39.550]  And let's take a look at who Dina Powell is and why this is a big victory for the Trump people.
[03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:42.670]  She's a Goldman Sachs person through and through.
[03:21:43.191 --> 03:21:45.691]  She had always been against the patriots.
[03:21:46.131 --> 03:21:49.252]  She had said very derogatory remarks about the deplorables.
[03:21:49.732 --> 03:21:54.473]  She had always said that she was better than everyone else and
[03:21:55.416 --> 03:21:57.477]  She brokered that big deal with Saudi Arabia.
[03:21:57.917 --> 03:22:01.237]  She did, and Gary Cohen did, because Goldman Sachs.
[03:22:01.678 --> 03:22:03.558]  Are they going to get a piece of that Saudi Arabia deal?
[03:22:03.578 --> 03:22:04.558]  A little piece of that action?
[03:22:04.898 --> 03:22:17.181]  So what happens is these people, they go from Goldman Sachs into government, they broker these big deals, and then when they go back, they get richly rewarded with bonuses.
[03:22:17.221 --> 03:22:18.962]  But of course, don't call it a bribe.
[03:22:19.522 --> 03:22:20.282]  It isn't a bribe.
[03:22:20.342 --> 03:22:21.142]  It isn't a kickback.
[03:22:21.202 --> 03:22:22.082]  It isn't a payoff.
[03:22:22.102 --> 03:22:24.143]  They're just, you know, they're being rewarded.
[03:22:25.083 --> 03:22:26.664]  For their great public service.
[03:22:27.805 --> 03:22:28.326]  That's right.
[03:22:29.466 --> 03:22:30.127]  That's what it is.
[03:22:30.167 --> 03:22:32.028]  They're such great public service and they're being awarded.
[03:22:32.509 --> 03:22:35.391]  So, Dina Powell has always been bad news.
[03:22:35.731 --> 03:22:37.333]  She was brought in by Ivanka.
[03:22:37.833 --> 03:22:43.177]  So, a few things that a lot of people don't know about the National Security Council that I've always known.
[03:22:43.197 --> 03:22:46.620]  McMaster opposed the move to the U.S.
[03:22:46.680 --> 03:22:49.462]  Embassy, or the move of Jerusalem being the name of the capital.
[03:22:50.416 --> 03:22:52.317]  And for Jerusalem be the embassy.
[03:22:52.617 --> 03:22:55.798]  And again, I tweeted this stuff out, I don't know, months ago.
[03:22:55.878 --> 03:22:57.239]  Way back in March, April.
[03:22:58.399 --> 03:22:59.200]  Again in August.
[03:22:59.680 --> 03:23:07.083]  McMaster had always said that, hey, we can't, we can't make our embassy be in Jerusalem because then terrorists might attack us.
[03:23:08.003 --> 03:23:10.504]  McMaster's viewpoint is that we should appease terrorists.
[03:23:11.045 --> 03:23:14.786]  McMaster's viewpoint is that the Muslim Brotherhood should be running the NSC.
[03:23:15.507 --> 03:23:18.688]  McMaster's point of view is that they should have diversity seminars.
[03:23:19.682 --> 03:23:32.474]  McMaster, in fact, and Al-Bajaktari, they prohibited, I forget her name, I forget how to pronounce it, but she was a Somali, I believe, or Ethiopian, Ayan, Ayan Ali, I believe is her name.
[03:23:32.974 --> 03:23:38.579]  She was going to give her research paper on what is going on with radical Islamic terror.
[03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:42.563]  Bajaktari said, can't do it, violation of diversity standards.
[03:23:42.623 --> 03:23:44.385]  McMaster said, well, I'm side with Bajaktari.
[03:23:46.044 --> 03:23:57.514]  So then she had to go give, instead of giving her full presentation before the National Security Council, she gave it to, you know, eight or ten other people, including Bannon in Gorka when he was there, right?
[03:23:58.935 --> 03:23:59.796]  So that's where we are.
[03:24:00.236 --> 03:24:04.360]  McMaster has capitulated to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:10.005]  That's why a lot of us within the white, not us, but a lot of people in the White House call it the McMaster Brotherhood.
[03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:15.030]  Because that's what the NSC is, is the joining of H.R.
[03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:21.391]  McMaster and the Muslim Brotherhood, and that is now who is running national security, making America terribly unsafe.
[03:24:21.991 --> 03:24:29.492]  So McMaster, Dean O'Powell, Cohen, they all, you gotta remember, you gotta remember, how do these people make more money?
[03:24:31.273 --> 03:24:32.913]  Is terrorism profitable?
[03:24:34.293 --> 03:24:35.993]  Is war profitable?
[03:24:36.013 --> 03:24:39.194]  Does Goldman Sachs make a lot of money?
[03:24:40.143 --> 03:24:41.484]  When there are wars going on?
[03:24:41.544 --> 03:24:43.525]  Because remember, they're not the ones fighting these wars.
[03:24:44.526 --> 03:24:48.008]  Dina Powell isn't the one who's going to fight these wars, right?
[03:24:48.669 --> 03:24:51.271]  Yeah, McMaster worked at a think tank backed by Soros.
[03:24:52.191 --> 03:24:54.933]  So everywhere, there's also a big story, GQ broke.
[03:24:56.274 --> 03:24:58.776]  They're calling it a conspiracy theorist, but
[03:24:59.853 --> 03:25:09.823]  There's a new article about how McMaster is getting information to Soros through Petraeus, which I reported on Alex Jones, you know, six months ago.
[03:25:09.843 --> 03:25:10.784]  That's the thing.
[03:25:10.804 --> 03:25:14.347]  I've broken so much news that I can't even keep track of it all.
[03:25:15.268 --> 03:25:18.010]  But GQ and they're kind of like snide dismissive.
[03:25:18.030 --> 03:25:24.176]  They go, oh, listen to the latest conspiracy theory about Soros funded groups and Eric Trent's McMaster.
[03:25:24.196 --> 03:25:24.697]  But it's true.
[03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:27.770]  Everything in that article is true.
[03:25:27.790 --> 03:25:32.852]  McMaster is part of, he's a puppet of Soros, and he is a puppet of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:25:33.273 --> 03:25:34.853]  He's in cahoots with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:25:34.913 --> 03:25:43.938]  Right, so the GQ article, for those of you listening, headline, have you heard the one about the Clinton-Soros plot to overthrow Trump?
[03:25:44.318 --> 03:25:53.182]  So I actually gave comment on this article, and you know, they're always gonna spin it the way they're gonna spin it, but the truth is that Bajaktari
[03:25:54.406 --> 03:25:56.387]  Who is McMaster's right-hand man.
[03:25:56.407 --> 03:26:04.729]  Hardcore to the Muslim Brotherhood and hardcore into helping eliminate any kind of references to radical Islamic terrorism.
[03:26:05.369 --> 03:26:08.570]  His wife was a diversity director for the Pentagon.
[03:26:09.130 --> 03:26:10.511]  This is all verifiable stuff.
[03:26:10.831 --> 03:26:13.232]  There are multiple pictures of him with Deep State members.
[03:26:13.892 --> 03:26:17.493]  So you can find Bajaktari with all of the Obama holdovers.
[03:26:17.513 --> 03:26:18.753]  They're all very good friends.
[03:26:19.273 --> 03:26:21.514]  But the main true media, they don't want to report these.
[03:26:22.638 --> 03:26:26.141]  But when they do report, they go, oh, have you heard this latest conspiracy theory?
[03:26:27.822 --> 03:26:31.705]  You mean like the conspiracy theory that the yearbook was a fabrication?
[03:26:32.445 --> 03:26:41.792]  You mean the conspiracy theory that the yearbook held up at a press conference by Gloria Allred was a fabrication?
[03:26:41.992 --> 03:26:42.413]  Forgery?
[03:26:42.533 --> 03:26:45.375]  Yeah, that was a conspiracy theory too.
[03:26:46.136 --> 03:26:50.219]  So many conspiracy theories, you know, you just can't even keep track.
[03:26:51.593 --> 03:26:59.196]  Until, of course, then you find out that what the media calls the conspiracy theory, nine out of ten times, it's going to be true.
[03:27:00.076 --> 03:27:05.618]  So, Chris Colizia, CNN, goes, Roy Moore's appalling yearbook defense.
[03:27:06.678 --> 03:27:08.099]  And you scroll down to the article.
[03:27:08.959 --> 03:27:12.420]  Colizia goes, Roy Moore is such a bad guy.
[03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:17.982]  He's trying to claim, trying to claim the yearbook was a forgery.
[03:27:18.382 --> 03:27:20.383]  What kind of conspiracy theory?
[03:27:21.286 --> 03:27:23.388]  Would save here, but could be forged.
[03:27:23.869 --> 03:27:25.290]  These people are out of control.
[03:27:26.732 --> 03:27:35.540]  So it says, Roy Moore faces accusations from five women that he pursued sexual relationships with them while they were aged between 14 and 18.
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:36.822]  He was in his mid 30s.
[03:27:37.202 --> 03:27:42.027]  Well, right away, that right there is what I would call spin and not fabrication.
[03:27:43.048 --> 03:27:45.250]  And by that, I mean, they're not lying.
[03:27:46.013 --> 03:27:54.580]  Roy Moore did face accusations, but if you're on a date with an 18-year-old and you're 32, hey, I'm not saying you should do that.
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.582]  I'm not saying that there's anything cool about that.
[03:27:57.702 --> 03:28:01.825]  I'm not saying I endorse it, but that is completely legal, so that isn't an accusation.
[03:28:02.706 --> 03:28:11.253]  If somebody goes, oh yes, we went to the ice cream parlor, had a scoop of ice cream, and I was above the age of consent, then that's not an accusation.
[03:28:11.353 --> 03:28:15.256]  That's just telling that, yeah, we went on a date and he was into, you know, an 18-year-old.
[03:28:15.922 --> 03:28:16.122]  Right?
[03:28:17.123 --> 03:28:20.786]  But then the next paragraph down is where they really think they got him good.
[03:28:21.866 --> 03:28:27.350]  The next paragraph down they go, Roy Moore's latest defense against these serious charges?
[03:28:28.331 --> 03:28:37.217]  That the inscriptions from Beverly Young Nelson's 1977... Exclamation point.
[03:28:37.617 --> 03:28:37.837]  Fake.
[03:28:38.158 --> 03:28:38.818]  How dare he?
[03:28:39.559 --> 03:28:42.701]  It's written in that kind of very snarky liberal style.
[03:28:43.470 --> 03:28:58.788]  But today, ABC News reveals, by accident, that it was... So what we're going to do in the next segment is we're going to talk about ABC News, how they accidentally broke news, and now how they're trying to cover up news they accidentally broke.
[03:29:02.958 --> 03:29:12.403]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[03:29:12.984 --> 03:29:17.646]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[03:29:18.306 --> 03:29:29.653]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[03:29:30.529 --> 03:29:43.918]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[03:29:44.738 --> 03:29:49.881]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[03:29:50.362 --> 03:29:51.803]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[03:29:52.663 --> 03:29:53.505]  And a lot of protein.
[03:29:54.026 --> 03:29:55.388]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[03:29:55.428 --> 03:29:56.069]  There's buildup.
[03:29:56.109 --> 03:29:59.755]  It can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis.
[03:29:59.935 --> 03:30:00.456]  You name it.
[03:30:01.017 --> 03:30:03.381]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[03:30:04.468 --> 03:30:11.933]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[03:30:12.474 --> 03:30:24.442]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[03:30:24.762 --> 03:30:27.284]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[03:30:27.924 --> 03:30:31.907]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[03:30:32.307 --> 03:30:34.168]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[03:30:34.608 --> 03:30:48.458]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[03:30:48.678 --> 03:30:54.902]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits from proven high-quality probiotics
[03:30:55.262 --> 03:31:00.066]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[03:31:00.406 --> 03:31:03.288]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[03:31:03.729 --> 03:31:05.510]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:06.011 --> 03:31:16.319]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[03:31:17.440 --> 03:31:19.641]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[03:31:20.766 --> 03:31:33.552]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[03:31:34.152 --> 03:31:43.337]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[03:31:44.881 --> 03:31:46.602]  This is the total win-win.
[03:31:47.123 --> 03:31:52.827]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[03:31:53.388 --> 03:31:57.811]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[03:31:58.132 --> 03:32:02.195]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[03:32:02.655 --> 03:32:03.616]  At the lowest price.
[03:32:04.116 --> 03:32:13.562]  Many probiotics out there don't even have capillates that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[03:32:14.122 --> 03:32:20.927]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[03:32:21.787 --> 03:32:29.353]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[03:32:29.713 --> 03:32:35.397]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[03:32:35.857 --> 03:32:40.541]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[03:32:41.141 --> 03:32:50.168]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[03:32:51.249 --> 03:32:54.970]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[03:32:55.170 --> 03:33:02.992]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:33:04.373 --> 03:33:07.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.727 --> 03:33:21.008]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:21.368 --> 03:33:23.189]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:26.471]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:27.792 --> 03:33:33.094]  And we're back, Mike Cernovich, here with some ho-ho-ho Merry Christmas news.
[03:33:33.835 --> 03:33:37.256]  There is a special right now in gift cards.
[03:33:38.477 --> 03:33:39.837]  InfoWars gift cards.
[03:33:40.478 --> 03:33:44.660]  If I believe it right, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe there's a discount now
[03:33:45.735 --> 03:33:46.896]  On gift cards.
[03:33:47.537 --> 03:33:47.977]  I believe it.
[03:33:48.037 --> 03:33:48.858]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[03:33:49.138 --> 03:33:49.478]  Hold on.
[03:33:49.538 --> 03:33:54.222]  I don't want to be wrong, but I thought I got an email saying I'm going to have to confirm that, though.
[03:33:54.322 --> 03:33:55.042]  I don't want to spread.
[03:33:55.062 --> 03:33:56.724]  I'm going to be careful than I thought.
[03:33:56.784 --> 03:34:01.367]  I thought I saw there was a discount on the gift cards, but I don't see it listed actually on the website.
[03:34:01.487 --> 03:34:04.490]  So unfortunately, I don't know.
[03:34:04.590 --> 03:34:05.751]  Maybe I'm telling.
[03:34:06.451 --> 03:34:07.112]  Maybe I'm telling.
[03:34:07.252 --> 03:34:10.975]  Maybe I'm spreading fake news about 10% off.
[03:34:10.995 --> 03:34:12.596]  OK, so it's not showing on the website.
[03:34:13.425 --> 03:34:18.110]  But get gift cards for Christmas at 10% for the InfoWars store.
[03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:22.554]  So I don't know why that's not really showing up, but that is a great special today.
[03:34:23.094 --> 03:34:27.419]  It allows people to buy whatever they want to buy, whenever they want to buy.
[03:34:27.899 --> 03:34:29.040]  Everybody loves gift cards.
[03:34:29.621 --> 03:34:31.062]  Everybody loves InfoWars.
[03:34:31.102 --> 03:34:33.725]  So this is a way to support
[03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:39.947]  Real news, this is the way to make yourself healthier, to help other people become healthier.
[03:34:40.928 --> 03:34:45.774]  You can buy anything you want with the gift cards and you can get your family taken care of.
[03:34:47.556 --> 03:34:48.097]  So there you go.
[03:34:48.537 --> 03:34:49.478]  Doesn't get any better than that.
[03:34:49.799 --> 03:34:51.080]  Doesn't get any better than that.
[03:34:51.100 --> 03:34:51.661]  10% off cash.
[03:34:51.821 --> 03:34:52.963]  Best investment you'll make.
[03:34:54.088 --> 03:34:54.848]  Other than Bitcoin.
[03:34:55.088 --> 03:34:56.249]  But you're investing in your health.
[03:34:56.589 --> 03:34:58.370]  So maybe that will be even better than Bitcoin.
[03:34:58.730 --> 03:35:01.011]  So today we have a lot of news.
[03:35:01.031 --> 03:35:05.712]  So, you know, I'm going to look away from a second just to try to tie this all in.
[03:35:07.133 --> 03:35:11.495]  Because I remember I want to talk about how the media is going into Trump's health now.
[03:35:12.755 --> 03:35:12.995]  Right?
[03:35:14.016 --> 03:35:20.038]  So Don Lemon of CNN and Morning Joe and all the media, they're talking about Trump's health.
[03:35:20.058 --> 03:35:21.278]  They're saying, is Trump healthy?
[03:35:22.519 --> 03:35:23.059]  Is Trump
[03:35:24.142 --> 03:35:24.682]  Okay.
[03:35:26.022 --> 03:35:27.463]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:35:28.643 --> 03:35:30.884]  I thought that it was a conspiracy theory.
[03:35:30.904 --> 03:35:39.065]  I thought it was a conspiracy theory to talk about health, because remember when we talked about Hillary's health?
[03:35:39.085 --> 03:35:43.286]  So for those of you who are listening in, I'll read you the tweet that I tweeted out.
[03:35:43.607 --> 03:35:47.327]  Remember when the media said speculating about someone's health is a conspiracy theory?
[03:35:48.248 --> 03:35:49.848]  Amazing how the rules change.
[03:35:50.660 --> 03:35:53.881]  Morning Joe Roundtable speculates about Trump's mental health.
[03:35:54.282 --> 03:35:56.483]  So Morning Joe, of course, is MSNBC.
[03:35:57.563 --> 03:36:00.444]  They are now saying, well, I mean, is Trump healthy?
[03:36:00.464 --> 03:36:02.445]  He slurred his speech a little bit.
[03:36:02.505 --> 03:36:03.486]  Maybe his throat was dry.
[03:36:03.506 --> 03:36:04.006]  Well, I don't know.
[03:36:04.346 --> 03:36:05.686]  That isn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:06.847 --> 03:36:13.650]  And then Brian Spelter also tweeted out that we are now allowed to talk about Trump's health.
[03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:16.051]  But if you go back in time,
[03:36:16.852 --> 03:36:17.012]  Right?
[03:36:17.052 --> 03:36:18.233]  That's why they hate the internet.
[03:36:18.673 --> 03:36:24.855]  The real reason they want to ban you, because we'll show you these if you're watching, and we'll show you one after another, and for those listening in, I'll have you a timeline.
[03:36:25.616 --> 03:36:29.277]  Here's a tweet from 8.56pm on December 6th by Brian Stelter.
[03:36:30.157 --> 03:36:33.439]  It said, is it fair to ask about the president's health here?
[03:36:34.359 --> 03:36:35.059]  Of course it is!
[03:36:36.380 --> 03:36:38.121]  So this is a December 17th tweet.
[03:36:39.881 --> 03:36:44.443]  Now let's go to that Real Clear Politics article that the production team has locked and loaded.
[03:36:44.843 --> 03:36:46.424]  Here's what Brian Stelter said,
[03:36:47.808 --> 03:36:49.288]  August 2016.
[03:36:49.528 --> 03:36:51.009]  So I'm sorry, the tweet we just read was 2017.
[03:36:51.469 --> 03:37:02.732]  So over a year ago, Brian Stelter goes, Sean Hannity irresponsibly spreading conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton's health problem.
[03:37:03.012 --> 03:37:06.652]  By the way, I think I just slurred a little bit there because my mouth is dry.
[03:37:06.672 --> 03:37:08.033]  I've talked for four hours today.
[03:37:08.053 --> 03:37:10.373]  So go figure, right?
[03:37:10.853 --> 03:37:11.354]  Go figure.
[03:37:11.374 --> 03:37:12.614]  You're President Donald Trump.
[03:37:12.994 --> 03:37:14.174]  You're in meetings all day.
[03:37:14.434 --> 03:37:15.595]  You're taking calls all day.
[03:37:15.635 --> 03:37:17.155]  You're talking to world leaders all day.
[03:37:18.385 --> 03:37:25.050]  Maybe you drink a couple Diet Cokes or Coke Zeros or InfoWars coffee, and you get a little dry mouth.
[03:37:25.871 --> 03:37:27.912]  And then when you talk, maybe the word doesn't come out.
[03:37:28.033 --> 03:37:32.696]  Oh, now, you know, we can say that you got a mental problem, that you're sick.
[03:37:32.836 --> 03:37:33.477]  And that's free.
[03:37:34.197 --> 03:37:35.258]  You're free to talk about that.
[03:37:35.498 --> 03:37:45.886]  But if you're Hillary Clinton, and you have to cancel multiple events due to some mysterious cough, and have multiple falls,
[03:37:47.671 --> 03:37:53.976]  And multiple trips and multiple bone breaks and multiple concussions and memory loss and Uma says you're often confused.
[03:37:54.877 --> 03:37:59.240]  You're called a conspiracy theorist and then of course Brian Stelter tweeted out as a conspiracy theory.
[03:38:00.101 --> 03:38:08.768]  Two or three weeks before Hillary Clinton had a seizure on 9-11, her body locked up consistent with a neurological condition.
[03:38:09.148 --> 03:38:11.029]  Some doctors say Parkinson and fell down.
[03:38:12.551 --> 03:38:16.594]  And speaking of which, Donna Brazile in her books hacked
[03:38:17.933 --> 03:38:24.677]  ...said that people who supported Hillary were reaching out to say she doesn't look healthy.
[03:38:25.497 --> 03:38:31.140]  So this right now, folks, for everybody watching, this is real news in real time.
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:33.601]  This is why they want InfoWars banned.
[03:38:34.642 --> 03:38:37.543]  This is why they want banned from social media.
[03:38:38.144 --> 03:38:42.206]  Donna Brazile's book exposes liberal media's Hillary health cover-up.
[03:38:42.808 --> 03:38:44.369]  So now finally we're getting the truth.
[03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:48.951]  This is November 7, 2017, so over a year and a half after media lied to us.
[03:38:50.312 --> 03:38:55.214]  Donna Brazile wrote in her book, Hillary Clinton's very unhealthy, people worried about her.
[03:38:55.514 --> 03:38:59.356]  Donna Brazile even said, I went to Hillary Clinton and asked her what was wrong, I thought she looked fatigued.
[03:39:01.917 --> 03:39:05.619]  This is why, and this is the only reason they want us banned.
[03:39:07.242 --> 03:39:08.663]  Because they want to attack you.
[03:39:09.043 --> 03:39:10.203]  They want to lie to you.
[03:39:10.603 --> 03:39:12.044]  They want to brainwash you.
[03:39:12.404 --> 03:39:20.106]  They don't want you to have somebody go, well, wait a minute, this big thing the media is saying today that can be talked about, they said we can't talk about health.
[03:39:21.267 --> 03:39:24.328]  The media are the ones who said talking about health is a conspiracy.
[03:39:24.628 --> 03:39:26.289]  The media has done that, right?
[03:39:27.589 --> 03:39:29.510]  They go, oh, let's just pretend that never happened.
[03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:35.892]  Let's just pretend that, so these media double standards, I mean, this is a, Trump, um,
[03:39:36.994 --> 03:39:40.055]  Media spreads conspiracy theory about Trump's health.
[03:39:40.356 --> 03:39:42.496]  I think that's what we'll title this segment.
[03:39:42.657 --> 03:39:44.677]  Because we have to make them play by the rules.
[03:39:45.598 --> 03:39:51.660]  So the media, they are now the conspiracy theorists and they're spreading conspiracy theories about Trump's health.
[03:39:52.021 --> 03:39:55.802]  Because unlike Hillary, Trump just had a dry mouth.
[03:39:56.383 --> 03:39:57.943]  My mouth is a little dry right now.
[03:39:58.523 --> 03:39:59.424]  I got some kombucha.
[03:40:00.126 --> 03:40:04.549]  Got some kombucha next to me that I'm drinking in between segments because I'm a little parched.
[03:40:05.089 --> 03:40:11.954]  Because if you talk as much as I talk, and as Trump talks even more than I do, eventually your vocal cords are like, no, no, no.
[03:40:11.974 --> 03:40:13.715]  We're gonna go on strike.
[03:40:15.156 --> 03:40:19.839]  So Trump one day slurs a few words, and now it's open season on his health.
[03:40:20.320 --> 03:40:24.162]  But Hillary Clinton has multiple coughing fits, multiple dizzy spells.
[03:40:24.542 --> 03:40:25.643]  Buma sends an email.
[03:40:25.703 --> 03:40:27.404]  Hillary Clinton is often confused.
[03:40:27.985 --> 03:40:29.125]  Hillary looks unhealthy.
[03:40:29.165 --> 03:40:29.806]  She looks sick.
[03:40:30.572 --> 03:40:31.793]  But that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:40:32.073 --> 03:40:34.595]  And then Hillary Clinton faints and has a seizure.
[03:40:34.615 --> 03:40:37.637]  And then the media goes, oh, she's hot, she didn't drink enough water.
[03:40:37.657 --> 03:40:40.959]  And then you look at the temperature and it was really like 85 degrees or something.
[03:40:41.479 --> 03:40:44.361]  You know, we're not talking about she was in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[03:40:44.961 --> 03:40:46.302]  So yeah, here's Morning Joe.
[03:40:47.123 --> 03:40:55.408]  For those of you listening and now watching, you can watch the Morning Joe people say, oh, Trump, he slurred his speech, got an S wrong because of that.
[03:40:56.207 --> 03:40:56.867]  Must be sick.
[03:40:57.227 --> 03:40:58.948]  This is a media conspiracy theory.
[03:40:59.288 --> 03:41:02.449]  But when we have all this evidence on Hillary, they still bring up Hillary's health.
[03:41:02.709 --> 03:41:03.789]  Foolishly, I might add.
[03:41:04.810 --> 03:41:07.631]  Because I love it when they bring up Hillary's health.
[03:41:07.951 --> 03:41:11.632]  When they go, wow, you spread conspiracy theories about Hillary's health.
[03:41:12.352 --> 03:41:13.432]  I think to myself, wow.
[03:41:14.073 --> 03:41:17.794]  You guys are still... Is that the hell you guys want to die on?
[03:41:18.254 --> 03:41:19.494]  When everybody knows she's sick?
[03:41:19.874 --> 03:41:20.955]  So they have no standards.
[03:41:21.895 --> 03:41:24.856]  And of course, we revealed this too with this whole Sam Seder
[03:41:27.057 --> 03:41:35.500]  And MSNBC contributor Sam Seder, he tweeted out a joke or a satire, according to him, about child rape.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:36.980]  Very, very horrific.
[03:41:37.060 --> 03:41:40.161]  I couldn't even read it on air, on the radio, and not even save for radio.
[03:41:42.002 --> 03:41:46.643]  So a bunch of people told MSNBC, hey man, this is, you know, you're not supposed to make rape jokes, right?
[03:41:46.683 --> 03:41:48.644]  Because remember Dane Cook got in all that trouble?
[03:41:49.384 --> 03:41:56.646]  They said comedians should never make rape jokes because that is such a bad subject to talk about, you shouldn't joke about it.
[03:41:57.757 --> 03:42:05.140]  So, child rape, I mean, if you, you know, I don't want to discount rape, but child rape is what, pretty much the worst thing that can ever happen to a child?
[03:42:06.500 --> 03:42:10.742]  So you shouldn't make child rape jokes or satire, as he claims now.
[03:42:11.102 --> 03:42:12.342]  He didn't answer when I emailed him.
[03:42:12.383 --> 03:42:13.703]  He could have said it was satire then.
[03:42:13.723 --> 03:42:19.565]  I don't know that I believed him then, or that I believe him now, but the point is, he gets to stay on CNN.
[03:42:20.946 --> 03:42:23.347]  But Jeffers, MSNBC, and he'll go on CNN.
[03:42:23.607 --> 03:42:26.888]  But Jeffrey Lord, he made a hail Hitler reference
[03:42:29.195 --> 03:42:31.317]  He made a hail Hitler reference.
[03:42:34.660 --> 03:42:36.521]  So the double standard has been exposed.
[03:42:37.022 --> 03:42:41.906]  If you do satire and you're Alex Jones, they're going to treat that as literally true.
[03:42:42.807 --> 03:42:46.490]  But if you do satire and you're on the left, you can satirize child rape.
[03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:48.031]  You talk about anything you want.
[03:42:48.983 --> 03:42:51.809]  If you're on the right team, the media has no integrity.
[03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:53.292]  They have no decency.
[03:42:53.613 --> 03:42:57.441]  That's why your support is so valuable and why I love talking with all of you.
[03:42:58.042 --> 03:42:59.806]  We'll be back in a few more minutes.
[03:43:02.148 --> 03:43:05.030]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[03:43:05.130 --> 03:43:14.176]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[03:43:14.256 --> 03:43:15.457]  So what do we do about it?
[03:43:15.637 --> 03:43:18.759]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[03:43:18.959 --> 03:43:26.581]  Fight back with the all new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.

[03:44:45.848 --> 03:44:46.569]  We're good to go.
[03:45:05.802 --> 03:45:06.703]  Let's talk to Danny.
[03:45:06.743 --> 03:45:07.623]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[03:45:07.643 --> 03:45:08.304]  You're on the air, Danny.
[03:45:08.704 --> 03:45:08.924]  Hi.
[03:45:09.024 --> 03:45:13.987]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[03:45:14.027 --> 03:45:14.327]  Thank you.
[03:45:14.347 --> 03:45:23.313]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[03:45:23.433 --> 03:45:36.504]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[03:45:36.584 --> 03:45:45.852]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[03:45:46.252 --> 03:45:50.436]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[03:45:51.076 --> 03:45:52.877]  And it reboots itself.
[03:45:52.977 --> 03:45:55.398]  So, I mean, think about that.
[03:45:55.798 --> 03:46:07.264]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[03:46:07.364 --> 03:46:08.044]  Let me be clear.
[03:46:08.164 --> 03:46:15.328]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[03:46:16.008 --> 03:46:21.696]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back, it may hurt worse for a while.
[03:46:21.996 --> 03:46:25.241]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[03:46:25.581 --> 03:46:28.265]  I took DNA for a few months, it came back, sort of tingling.
[03:46:28.585 --> 03:46:29.586]  The feeling is back.
[03:46:29.747 --> 03:46:33.051]  So it doesn't grow telomeres, it keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[03:46:33.291 --> 03:46:43.774]  Yes, and I mean the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[03:46:43.834 --> 03:46:46.055]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[03:46:46.115 --> 03:46:48.335]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[03:46:48.395 --> 03:46:51.336]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[03:46:51.376 --> 03:46:53.257]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[03:46:53.277 --> 03:46:57.938]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:04.925 --> 03:47:07.541]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.492 --> 03:47:30.987]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.688 --> 03:47:34.673]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:36.408 --> 03:47:46.895]  And we're back with the final segment, Mike Cernovich Find Breaking News and amazing viral videos done by my team at facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:47.476 --> 03:47:52.759]  I'm on InfoWars one day a week, but we're on facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich every day.
[03:47:52.779 --> 03:47:52.819]  So
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:48:03.043]  You know, we're gonna go on CNN hard, but before we do, you know, I don't know if Alex has insulated cups yet, because they do have gift cards on sale for 10% off.
[03:48:03.523 --> 03:48:20.648]  But, you know, now that Trump, you know, he slurred his speech a little bit, so now that my mouth is a little dry, I feel like I have to rehydrate, or else CNN is gonna claim that, you know, I must be unhealthy, because anybody... I kid, I kid, but the reason we bring up CNN spreading conspiracy theories about Trump's health
[03:48:21.514 --> 03:48:24.156]  Is because CNN is busted.
[03:48:24.656 --> 03:48:28.398]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake news again.
[03:48:29.199 --> 03:48:32.401]  CNN has a pattern of fake news.
[03:48:32.421 --> 03:48:33.882]  So let's talk about the latest.
[03:48:34.342 --> 03:48:35.362]  We'll pull up my Twitter.
[03:48:35.723 --> 03:48:38.124]  So for those of you at home listening in, we'll just read the tweets.
[03:48:38.404 --> 03:48:39.625]  These aren't my tweets, by the way.
[03:48:39.945 --> 03:48:41.606]  These are stories other people have broken.
[03:48:41.626 --> 03:48:44.768]  So even if you don't believe me, believe what you read.
[03:48:44.928 --> 03:48:45.689]  Believe the other stories.
[03:48:46.189 --> 03:48:47.650]  So CNN wrote a big article.
[03:48:48.749 --> 03:48:51.011]  The article claimed that Don Jr.
[03:48:51.051 --> 03:48:53.052]  had advanced notice.
[03:48:54.093 --> 03:48:54.614]  Advanced.
[03:48:55.454 --> 03:48:56.495]  Notice to the WikiLeaks stop.
[03:48:56.955 --> 03:48:58.857]  So the story, wow, that's a pretty big story.
[03:48:58.917 --> 03:49:00.038]  Holy cow, Don Jr.
[03:49:00.058 --> 03:49:01.199]  is in cahoots with WikiLeaks.
[03:49:01.679 --> 03:49:01.999]  Wow.
[03:49:02.700 --> 03:49:03.240]  Big story.
[03:49:03.300 --> 03:49:04.021]  Can't believe it, right?
[03:49:06.043 --> 03:49:07.344]  So pay attention to the dates.
[03:49:08.885 --> 03:49:09.906]  The dates are what matter.
[03:49:09.946 --> 03:49:11.207]  The dates are what make or break the story.
[03:49:11.647 --> 03:49:13.608]  According to CNN, Don Jr.
[03:49:14.753 --> 03:49:22.637]  Received an email about the WikiLeaks dump September 4th, 2016, before WikiLeaks had been public.
[03:49:22.937 --> 03:49:23.457]  Bombshell.
[03:49:23.738 --> 03:49:24.198]  Boom.
[03:49:24.678 --> 03:49:25.118]  It's over.
[03:49:25.498 --> 03:49:26.979]  The resistance went wild.
[03:49:27.359 --> 03:49:28.440]  Biggest story on Twitter.
[03:49:28.800 --> 03:49:31.441]  Ted Lau is saying, oh my god, it's over.
[03:49:31.602 --> 03:49:32.822]  We finally got him busted.
[03:49:33.623 --> 03:49:36.264]  Well, fake news, CNN.
[03:49:36.584 --> 03:49:37.344]  Fake news again.
[03:49:37.965 --> 03:49:40.546]  The email was dated September 14th, 2016, and it was dated
[03:49:45.254 --> 03:49:49.978]  After the WikiLeaks hacks, or whatever you want to call them.
[03:49:50.359 --> 03:49:52.721]  Remember, if the media likes it, they call it a leak.
[03:49:54.102 --> 03:49:55.844]  If the media doesn't like it, they call it a hack.
[03:49:56.164 --> 03:49:58.706]  So always pay attention to how the media describes these things.
[03:49:59.767 --> 03:50:04.251]  If you give information the media likes, you're a brave, courageous whistleblower.
[03:50:05.046 --> 03:50:10.211]  If you give information that the media doesn't like, then you're a hacker or a wrongdoer.
[03:50:10.731 --> 03:50:12.433]  Just like me with the John Conyers thing.
[03:50:12.853 --> 03:50:20.640]  I was a whistleblower into sexual harassment undergone by women that women were undergoing by Conyers.
[03:50:21.661 --> 03:50:23.703]  The media didn't call me a courageous whistleblower.
[03:50:24.103 --> 03:50:26.786]  The media called me a bad person.
[03:50:26.826 --> 03:50:28.267]  They questioned my motives and everything.
[03:50:29.184 --> 03:50:30.825]  But, so back to CNN.
[03:50:31.285 --> 03:50:33.767]  The September 14th email to the Trump campaign.
[03:50:33.787 --> 03:50:34.667]  I'm going to read that.
[03:50:34.707 --> 03:50:39.270]  I want to read it to the people listening at home just to point out how fake CNN is.
[03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:54.059]  The September 14th email to the Trump campaign advertising the WikiLeaks emails was promoting publicly available information and came from a Trump backer who had no connection to WikiLeaks.
[03:50:54.419 --> 03:50:57.201]  So in other words, you know, a lot of people here who are listening and reading
[03:50:58.246 --> 03:50:59.607]  You'll send me a link to an article.
[03:50:59.987 --> 03:51:01.928]  And then a lot of times I'll say, oh, good article.
[03:51:01.988 --> 03:51:03.389]  And so I post a link to the article.
[03:51:03.449 --> 03:51:04.310]  Don't think anything of it.
[03:51:05.170 --> 03:51:05.811]  But that doesn't.
[03:51:05.971 --> 03:51:08.812]  So if you send me a link to WikiLeaks, that doesn't mean you're part of WikiLeaks.
[03:51:09.293 --> 03:51:12.134]  So their email was actually sent September 14th.
[03:51:12.295 --> 03:51:15.697]  And you can't make this up.
[03:51:16.917 --> 03:51:20.820]  But CNN, this isn't their first mistake on a big Russia story.
[03:51:21.140 --> 03:51:27.844]  Whenever these big Russia Mueller stories hit, you always need to take a cooling off period and wait for the traction.
[03:51:28.817 --> 03:51:31.578]  CNN had a big story about Anthony Scaramucci.
[03:51:32.839 --> 03:51:39.282]  They said Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation for taking money from Russia.
[03:51:39.903 --> 03:51:40.543]  Oh my god.
[03:51:41.323 --> 03:51:43.064]  This was back in June 2017.
[03:51:44.405 --> 03:51:44.985]  Oh my god.
[03:51:45.606 --> 03:51:46.086]  It's over.
[03:51:46.746 --> 03:51:48.667]  Scaramucci is under investigation.
[03:51:49.528 --> 03:51:56.111]  Well, as it turns out, Scaramucci is a man of means and he said, I'm going to sue you into oblivion because this is fake.
[03:51:57.159 --> 03:51:59.360]  CNN retracted the story and apologized.
[03:51:59.740 --> 03:52:01.201]  So CNN got the story fake.
[03:52:02.021 --> 03:52:05.683]  But let's look more deeper into the people who broke that fake news story.
[03:52:06.663 --> 03:52:08.964]  One of them had won a Pulitzer Prize for journalism.
[03:52:10.245 --> 03:52:12.426]  One of them had been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
[03:52:12.886 --> 03:52:17.928]  And if I'm not incorrect, one of them was from New York Times and one was from USA Today.
[03:52:17.948 --> 03:52:20.989]  So the New York Times actually did sort of a post-mortem on it.
[03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:26.652]  And I think the article is, how an elite media team was bruised by a fake Russia story.
[03:52:27.495 --> 03:52:29.857]  So that happens to CNN, right?
[03:52:29.877 --> 03:52:35.841]  So these journalists who blew the fake news story about Scaramucci, these were elite reporters.
[03:52:36.622 --> 03:52:38.083]  These weren't citizen journalists.
[03:52:38.223 --> 03:52:40.104]  These were the cream of the crop.
[03:52:41.065 --> 03:52:43.747]  Pulitzer Prize winners, Pulitzer Prize nominees.
[03:52:44.248 --> 03:52:46.029]  That is how big the news is.
[03:52:46.983 --> 03:52:48.424]  Pulitzer Prize people are fake.
[03:52:48.784 --> 03:52:50.725]  People nominated for Pulitzer Prizes are fake.
[03:52:51.005 --> 03:52:51.626]  It's all fake.
[03:52:51.966 --> 03:52:53.787]  Any story about Trump or Russia is fake.
[03:52:54.247 --> 03:52:57.169]  Any story about Alex Jones and the Civil War is fake.
[03:52:57.209 --> 03:53:05.273]  Sources said the three journalists responsible for the protracted story were very elite and headed the CNN Investigation Unit.
[03:53:05.774 --> 03:53:06.114]  Elite!
[03:53:07.242 --> 03:53:14.764]  That's why I never believe anything CNN says about Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, Donald Trump, Infowars, or any Republican.
[03:53:15.064 --> 03:53:16.525]  Because they're caught.
[03:53:16.825 --> 03:53:17.505]  Don Jr.
[03:53:17.645 --> 03:53:18.325]  They're caught.
[03:53:18.706 --> 03:53:19.986]  They're faking news every day.
[03:53:21.326 --> 03:53:26.488]  Jake Taper spread fake news about the testimony of James Comey.
[03:53:27.028 --> 03:53:30.209]  He said James Comey was going to testify that Trump obstructed justice.
[03:53:30.889 --> 03:53:33.850]  James Comey actually testified the opposite.
[03:53:34.270 --> 03:53:36.051]  And then they always do a little
[03:53:36.690 --> 03:53:38.131]  They go, we've updated our story.
[03:53:39.092 --> 03:53:40.613]  This is what the fake news media does.
[03:53:41.833 --> 03:53:50.119]  So let's go to my Twitter because I just see there's so much breaking news that if you're just a person with a real job, you can't even keep track of it.
[03:53:50.159 --> 03:53:52.640]  Yeah, so CNN succumbs to its own, call me hype.
[03:53:53.001 --> 03:53:55.822]  And then of course, let's talk about with CBS.
[03:53:56.963 --> 03:54:03.387]  CBS, if you scroll down a little bit on my timeline, CBS admits that they got the date wrong, but they say more.
[03:54:03.587 --> 03:54:04.368]  Scroll up a little bit.
[03:54:05.174 --> 03:54:12.236]  So CBS claimed the email was sent September 4th, and that the information was not publicly available.
[03:54:13.476 --> 03:54:17.558]  Rather than say, because remember, the date, don't be bored by the details.
[03:54:17.578 --> 03:54:18.858]  These are very, very important details.
[03:54:19.678 --> 03:54:23.079]  If the email was sent on September 4th, that's a pretty big story.
[03:54:23.199 --> 03:54:24.359]  Oh, wow, he had a chance notice.
[03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:31.061]  But if the email was sent on September 14th, there is no story other than, hey, somebody who liked Don Jr.
[03:54:31.401 --> 03:54:33.182]  sent him a leak of publicly available information.
[03:54:34.153 --> 03:54:35.954]  So let's click over to CBS News.
[03:54:36.614 --> 03:54:38.555]  They're not saying to retract our story.
[03:54:39.295 --> 03:54:40.736]  So scroll up to the first story.
[03:54:41.036 --> 03:54:41.716]  This is beautiful.
[03:54:42.137 --> 03:54:42.657]  I just love it.
[03:54:43.037 --> 03:54:43.377]  CBS.
[03:54:43.717 --> 03:54:44.317]  Don Jr.
[03:54:44.337 --> 03:54:47.559]  was offered access to hacked Democrat data during the campaign.
[03:54:48.419 --> 03:54:53.341]  A source who received the email tells CBS News, right, and then you go down and it says more.
[03:54:54.242 --> 03:54:56.583]  The September email to Donald Trump Jr.
[03:54:56.883 --> 03:54:59.064]  highlighted information that was already public.
[03:54:59.827 --> 03:55:01.028]  No, there is not before.
[03:55:01.428 --> 03:55:04.651]  But that's what they do, and that's what Fake Paper did with his Comey story.
[03:55:05.071 --> 03:55:08.714]  They go, oh, you know, we've updated the story.
[03:55:08.734 --> 03:55:09.895]  No, you didn't update it.
[03:55:10.636 --> 03:55:11.897]  There is no story now.
[03:55:12.157 --> 03:55:13.778]  You have to issue a retraction.
[03:55:14.218 --> 03:55:16.780]  You have to say, we blew it, just like me.
[03:55:17.501 --> 03:55:25.007]  At the beginning of the hour, I personally apologized to everybody watching and listening, and I personally apologized to Alex Jones and to more people.
[03:55:25.652 --> 03:55:28.273]  Because I thought it was crazy that Yearbook was forged.
[03:55:28.633 --> 03:55:29.754]  I was like, there's no way.
[03:55:29.854 --> 03:55:30.494]  Come on, guys.
[03:55:30.654 --> 03:55:31.374]  You know, shouldn't do.
[03:55:31.835 --> 03:55:32.835]  I'm wrong.
[03:55:32.895 --> 03:55:33.555]  I retract.
[03:55:33.595 --> 03:55:34.596]  I don't say update.
[03:55:35.536 --> 03:55:36.957]  I say, no, I retract that.
[03:55:37.137 --> 03:55:37.717]  I was wrong.
[03:55:38.377 --> 03:55:39.618]  The Yearbook is a forgery.
[03:55:39.998 --> 03:55:41.739]  Everybody who said it was a forgery was right.
[03:55:42.299 --> 03:55:42.819]  And I own it.
[03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:45.761]  That's why you guys trust us.
[03:55:45.901 --> 03:55:47.101]  That's why you guys trust Alex.
[03:55:47.561 --> 03:55:49.342]  And then the media tries to use it against us.
[03:55:49.402 --> 03:55:51.183]  Oh, well, they got a story wrong.
[03:55:52.017 --> 03:55:54.438]  Well, 99% of the time, we get it right.
[03:55:54.478 --> 03:55:59.340]  That 1% of the time, you have to own it, and then people know going forward, we're always going to try to be better.
[03:56:00.360 --> 03:56:02.701]  But CNN, they don't do that.
[03:56:03.081 --> 03:56:05.202]  They don't say, fully retract.
[03:56:05.382 --> 03:56:06.242]  Here's what they need to say.
[03:56:07.543 --> 03:56:08.283]  Retraction.
[03:56:08.923 --> 03:56:12.685]  Our earlier story got a crucial detail of the date wrong.
[03:56:13.905 --> 03:56:17.847]  When the email was sent, the information was already publicly available.
[03:56:18.327 --> 03:56:21.148]  Therefore, we retract the story and fold.
[03:56:22.216 --> 03:56:33.360]  This is how a person, a woman, a man, gender non-conforming, a furry, this is how any human entity would own the system.
[03:56:33.660 --> 03:56:37.782]  They would just say, hey, we retracted, it's not wrong, it's better in the future.
[03:56:37.822 --> 03:56:38.162]  You know what?
[03:56:38.202 --> 03:56:39.403]  That's how they would build trust.
[03:56:40.383 --> 03:56:45.665]  That's how they would build trust, because their peers would say, oh, wow, they're doing their best to tell the truth.
[03:56:46.417 --> 03:56:55.704]  But the next time CNN reports about me, Alex, and forth, John Jr., Audra Stone, John Cena, we don't believe it!
[03:56:56.304 --> 03:57:06.012]  Because we've now proved that they do lie, they will lie, they will spread fake news, and when they get it wrong, this won't take personal responsibility for what they do.
[03:57:06.892 --> 03:57:11.256]  Same way with CBS, ABC and Brian Ross, you know, they just got caught.
[03:57:11.336 --> 03:57:11.896]  That was fake news.
[03:57:12.256 --> 03:57:12.757]  But ABC?
[03:57:14.045 --> 03:57:18.268]  broke the story accidentally about Sherbrooke being a forgery.
[03:57:18.828 --> 03:57:20.709]  And we got to go to Audra's summons.
[03:57:21.430 --> 03:57:23.411]  ABC asked her, did you forge it?
[03:57:23.431 --> 03:57:24.552]  She said, Ty, I did.
[03:57:25.092 --> 03:57:25.872]  They just moved on.
[03:57:25.892 --> 03:57:27.834]  They changed the subject.
[03:57:27.854 --> 03:57:31.316]  So the reporter was thinking, you got it.
[03:57:31.776 --> 03:57:34.538]  So even when ABC breaks news, they fake news.
[03:57:35.066 --> 03:57:35.867]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:36.127 --> 03:57:36.767]  Thanks for listening.
