[00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.467]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:21.269]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.351]  It's Friday, July 21st, 2017.
[00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:23.133]  Here are top stories.
[00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.167]  Tonight, we have the documents.
[00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:53.341]  The plot to replace Europeans with migrants and refugees is exposed as a new bombshell UN document surfaces that proves without a doubt that the UN's endgame is to turn Europe into an easily controlled slave society and third world country.
[00:00:54.582 --> 00:01:05.365]  Fake news becomes a false flag as a bogus news report is used to create sanctions and economic warfare against Qatar.
[00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:14.507]  All that plus the covert CIA program to take over Syria gets trumped and the neocons are not happy.
[00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:18.608]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:35.374]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.678]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.585]  So please secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:21.019]  Our listening audience has heard us talk many times about UN Agenda 21, and of course it was an agenda for the 21st century to control populations, to confine them to megacities, to keep them off the land and otherwise control them.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.460]  There's another UN agenda.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.141]  I guess we should call this one Invasion 21.
[00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:29.282]  This is a document we're going to take a look at right now from the year 2000.
[00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:34.005]  And what this shows is what many of us have been talking about.
[00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.268]  Many people have called it the Great People Replacement.
[00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:39.231]  Well, they were talking about that 17 years ago.
[00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:40.433]  It was a plan.
[00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:47.480]  We've seen this and they've sold it to us as a reaction to events, like wars, which in many cases we create.
[00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:53.782]  But they saw it as a reaction to war, to other catastrophes, but no, it was their plan all along.
[00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:59.384]  So we're going to take a look at that because this is truly warfare against Western civilization.
[00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:02.864]  The last bulwark against global governance.
[00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:05.285]  So let's take a look at this article here from WND.
[00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.966]  They look at the plot to replace Europeans with refugees.
[00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:11.906]  And they say this is a UN document from 2000.
[00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.807]  It's called Replacement Migration.
[00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:19.293]  Is it a solution to declining and aging populations?
[00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.614]  That's the UN's document.
[00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:22.237]  We'll take a look at that in just a moment.
[00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:27.785]  It details plunging birth rates across Europe and of course also in the US and Japan.
[00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:31.109]  And it identifies a solution to those declining birth rates.
[00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.771]  Mass immigration that you're now seeing.
[00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:42.973]  They say, without the migration of populations from the developing world, it reasons, economies will suffer because of labor shortages and falling tax revenues.
[00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:50.195]  According to the UN documents, the meeting was attended by a host of government and non-governmental organizations and individuals.
[00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:51.456]  You know those people that they like to call
[00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:54.719]  Shareholders or stakeholders, that's what they call them.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.322]  Either way, they're the ones who are going to own everything.
[00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.304]  You are going to be the property.
[00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:07.732]  And those are the types of people that we see attending these events like Bilderberg and others that some of them public, some of them secret.
[00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:11.555]  Some of these organizations were the International Organization for Migration.
[00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:12.777]  That's a UN group.
[00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:17.859]  And it said that mass migration is not only, quote, inevitable, but necessary.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.204]  Also, the UN Population Fund, a group dedicated to family planning, in other words, depopulation, and the spread of contraceptives.
[00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:31.027]  So they talk about this, at the same time they say, well, you know, we've got to solve this problem.
[00:05:31.487 --> 00:05:34.909]  There's too much of a falling birth rate in the West.
[00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.990]  While they're still pushing family planning, it's not about that.
[00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:48.993]  And it's not about saving the entitlement programs that the bankers and the government workers have pushed on Americans and those in developing countries.
[00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:59.836]  It was the IMF that was accused of rent-seeking when they stopped encouraging third world countries to invest in their infrastructure and to start borrowing money for their social programs.
[00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:00.996]  And that's where we are today.
[00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.017]  And of course this is the next step.
[00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:14.627]  They said, immigrants will not prevent the long-run aging of the population except in the highly unlikely scenario of a ten-fold increase in annual immigration levels.
[00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:15.528]  There we go.
[00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:18.410]  That's what they want and that's what we're seeing now.
[00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.494]  Let's take a look at the document itself from the UN.
[00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:26.017]  Replacement migration, is it a solution to declining and aging populations?
[00:06:26.057 --> 00:06:26.998]  And this is the way it begins.
[00:06:27.438 --> 00:06:38.626]  They say, the UN projections indicate that over the next 50 years, the populations of virtually all countries of Europe, as well as Japan, will face population decline and population aging.
[00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:44.850]  They say, taking a look at this, we see that we need to have replacement migration for eight low fertility countries.
[00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.391]  I named them.
[00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.554]  France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, now South Korea,
[00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:53.535]  Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and the United States.
[00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:55.056]  That includes us, folks.
[00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:58.077]  And then they specifically focus on Europe.
[00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.738]  They say two regions, Europe and the European Union.
[00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:12.783]  They're going to say replacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population aging resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.
[00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:20.048]  Now, if you think that this is all of this that is happening as we see in Europe, they say we've got to bring these refugees in.
[00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:21.450]  This is a crisis.
[00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.311]  No, it was a plan.
[00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.053]  A 17-year-old plan.
[00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:26.894]  They laid it out here in the documents.
[00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:32.979]  You have to understand, it's not an accident, it's not a reaction to what is happening, and it is not even a solution
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.382]  To what they're concerned about.
[00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:39.085]  And when they go through this document, we'll take a look at what they say about the United States.
[00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:43.069]  Because there, they start talking about life expectancy as well as birth rates.
[00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.572]  And how many workers are going to support retired people.
[00:07:46.993 --> 00:07:48.815]  See, this is about Social Security.
[00:07:49.375 --> 00:08:04.319]  They point out in the one on the United States, this is a subtitle of this UN document, they say, except for a temporary period in the late 1970s and 1980s, when it hovered around 1.8, the total fertility rate for the United States has continued to be around two children per woman.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.061]  Life expectancy at birth, meanwhile, has risen from 69 years in 1950 to 55 to 75.7 years in 1990 to 95.
[00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:09.721]  As a consequence,
[00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:22.045]  The proportion of the population that is aged 65 and older, that's what they're talking about, Social Security folks.
[00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:32.008]  And remember, it was Bismarck, who was the leader of Germany, the same guy that said, you don't want to see how laws are made for the same reason you don't want to see how sausage is made.
[00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:35.049]  They've been hiding their agenda from you folks.
[00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:39.290]  This is their agenda, their Invasion 21 agenda, if we want to talk about it that way.
[00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:43.020]  And of course, he was the one who put forward Social Security the first time.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.901]  He did it in Germany.
[00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:45.683]  And he picked the age of 65.
[00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:47.004]  Why?
[00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:50.127]  Because that was the life expectancy.
[00:08:50.507 --> 00:09:00.317]  So they were going to tell everybody, don't worry, we're going to take care of you in your old age, picking a date at which they're going to start giving the cash out, which was beyond what they expected you to live.
[00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:03.641]  That is the lie that Social Security has been all along.
[00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:05.923]  And so yeah, they do have a demographic problem.
[00:09:05.943 --> 00:09:10.629]  As people live longer, now they can't pay out because it was nothing but a Ponzi scheme.
[00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:18.179]  They say in order to keep the total population constant, it would be necessary to have 6.4 million migrants between 2030 and 2050, which is an average of 319,000 per year.
[00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:31.710]  And they go on and say, in the absence of migration, figures show that it would be necessary to raise the upper limit of the working age to 66.9 years.
[00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.490]  You know, they're going to do both.
[00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.632]  That's what I wrote down on my notes.
[00:09:35.652 --> 00:09:36.372]  They're going to do both of these.
[00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:44.936]  They're going to raise the retirement age and they're going to flood us with migrants because that is simply an excuse to bring the migrants in.
[00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:45.677]  As I said before,
[00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.504]  They want to use this as an invading army.
[00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:53.508]  They need to reduce our economy to third world levels.
[00:09:53.768 --> 00:10:00.434]  They need to take away our culture and our climate of laws so that they can enact their own global governance.
[00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:02.616]  We're the people who stand in their way.
[00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:06.959]  And that's why they need to level and homogenize the West.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.061]  Let's take a look at Social Security.
[00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:16.405]  Of course, we just saw in the last few days, they're saying that the unfunded liabilities have risen to 12.5 trillion dollars.
[00:10:16.526 --> 00:10:17.206]  Trillion dollars.
[00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:21.689]  And they're saying Social Security's combined trust fund can only pay scheduled benefits through 2034.
[00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.611]  However, do you really believe
[00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:33.494]  That the people that are coming in are going to take care of the aged European Eloi that they have absolute contempt for?
[00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.935]  Are they coming in as workers?
[00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:37.415]  Are they going to support us?
[00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:41.597]  Or are they going to come in expecting to get the entitlement state themselves?
[00:10:42.077 --> 00:10:43.117]  That's what Europe has become.
[00:10:43.157 --> 00:10:44.978]  That's why they are so vulnerable.
[00:10:45.338 --> 00:10:46.659]  Now another story from WND.
[00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:50.460]  European nations are now rebelling against EU refugee quotas.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.601]  In other words, this is the way they're implementing it.
[00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:57.104]  The EU is there as a subunit of global governance.
[00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:04.548]  It's there to consolidate the European countries so they can then be subsumed into a world governance.
[00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:08.790]  That was what the Transatlantic and the Trans-Pacific partnerships were about.
[00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.391]  And that's why it is so important
[00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:11.011]  I think?
[00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:46.754]  Their influence is growing as they announce support for a potential new ally against migration, and that would be Italy.
[00:11:46.794 --> 00:11:47.614]  Why is it Italy?
[00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:55.057]  It's because so many people are coming from Northern Africa, specifically Libya, where we created chaos and a haven for terrorism.
[00:11:55.597 --> 00:12:00.339]  Those people are fleeing through Libya and other North African states into Italy.
[00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:02.440]  That's the point of entrance for so many people.
[00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:08.423]  The Visegrad Group, and we've talked about this before, also known as V4, is a collection of Central European countries
[00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:13.948]  Committed to preserving their shared, quote, cultural and intellectual values within the EU.
[00:12:14.348 --> 00:12:15.329]  These are the four countries.
[00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.652]  Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Poland.
[00:12:18.913 --> 00:12:31.524]  It is no coincidence that Donald Trump went to Poland and made that great speech talking about Poland's history, how they would never let themselves be destroyed as a nation, even though they had been overrun
[00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:41.475]  With so many different invasions, especially in the 20th century by both the Nazis and the Stalinists coming in and destroying their country and then eventually subsuming them, they eventually came back out.
[00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:42.997]  And that's what he was talking about.
[00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:46.601]  The will to survive as a civilization.
[00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:48.503]  That's why Donald Trump went to Poland.
[00:12:48.823 --> 00:12:50.285]  That's why he did it before he went to the G20.
[00:12:51.406 --> 00:13:01.773]  As of today, reports WND, acting in direct opposition to the EU plan of forced migration, Poland and Hungary have not relocated a single refugee.
[00:13:02.173 --> 00:13:04.655]  And remember, this is not an emergency.
[00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:06.696]  This was a plan 17 years ago.
[00:13:08.317 --> 00:13:10.859]  A massive, a plan to bring people in.
[00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:20.308]  They create wars, and that is a real case, but they do that as a method to give them an excuse, a pretext for bringing these people in.
[00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:23.751]  It was always their plan to do this anyway, but they needed to have a reason.
[00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:27.053]  So they manufactured the reason, they manufactured a war.
[00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:31.776]  The Czech Republic only took in 12 refugees, and Slovakia only relocated 16.
[00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:36.178]  So two of the countries took in zero, and the other took in about a dozen.
[00:13:36.618 --> 00:13:43.041]  Polish Prime Minister has said that Poland, quote, will not participate in the Brussels elite's folly.
[00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:44.802]  That's precisely it, folks.
[00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:50.004]  And it's not just the Brussels elite, it is the UN agenda that Brussels is implementing.
[00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:58.484]  The Polish Interior Minister believes the threat from migrants is much worse than any threat of European sanctions and he's absolutely right.
[00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:05.568]  They said you can no longer speak about immigration but only about an invasion and that is coming from Italy.
[00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:11.952]  He says it is organized and funded and planned by Brussels with the complicity of Rome.
[00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:16.595]  He's the leader of Italy's populist Northern League party who said that in May.
[00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:18.496]  Now I want to play a video for you here.
[00:14:18.996 --> 00:14:25.480]  This is a video that was produced by the United Nations, and it shows this mass migration that we're talking about.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.241]  They call it Operation Triton.
[00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:29.983]  Let's go ahead and roll that video there, and we'll play that.
[00:14:30.483 --> 00:14:37.908]  As you see, this is a very dramatic, very heartwarming, visceral experience showing people coming in boats into Europe.
[00:14:37.928 --> 00:14:39.129]  And there's the mass of people.
[00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:42.711]  They say Italy is seeking to revise this Operation Triton.
[00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:49.778]  A border security effort that rescues migrants from sinking boats so that fewer of them are allowed to land in Italy.
[00:14:50.058 --> 00:14:52.461]  So what they're saying is, we're going to work with Italy to stop this.
[00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:54.783]  But this is the propaganda that you're watching right now.
[00:14:55.384 --> 00:14:58.247]  They're ignored, they're grateful, but they're skilled, they're going to take care of you.
[00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:03.552]  They're going to support and pay for your social security because they're so ambitious and successful.
[00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:04.813]  And they're human.
[00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:05.894]  Yes, they are human.
[00:15:06.214 --> 00:15:07.694]  But they do have a country.
[00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:16.838]  And we can help them in that country without destroying our culture, our civilization, and without impoverishing ourselves into the third world.
[00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:30.663]  They point out in the article, migrants have become so unpopular in Italy that the mayor of Castel Umberto in Sicily recently said, led a revolt to prevent a few dozen migrants from taking up residence in an abandoned hotel.
[00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:32.463]  See, this is what is happening.
[00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:34.304]  They're taking us down to a third world level.
[00:15:34.784 --> 00:15:38.045]  And if we take a look at what Bill Nye said about climate, remember I said it's borders?
[00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:44.367]  It's economic consolidation, which they then used to create a crisis, to create political consolidation.
[00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:45.768]  That's the plan that we've seen in Europe.
[00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:48.769]  That was a plan that was put out by Mikko Brzezinski's father.
[00:15:49.645 --> 00:15:52.386]  When he was running the Carter White House.
[00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:55.087]  And Bill Nye just points out what's going on here.
[00:15:55.107 --> 00:15:59.229]  He says, we have to wait for the climate deniers to die off.
[00:15:59.789 --> 00:16:04.471]  See, this is the third leg of the globalist plan to take over our world.
[00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:05.472]  And this is what he had to say.
[00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.773]  He said, it sounds like people are scared.
[00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:10.074]  It just sounds like people are afraid.
[00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:14.536]  And the people who are afraid in general, with due respect, and I'm now one of them, are older.
[00:16:15.296 --> 00:16:18.577]  Climate change deniers, by way of example, are older.
[00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:19.938]  It's generational.
[00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:24.259]  So we're just going to have to wait for those people to age out, as they say.
[00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.700]  Age out is a euphemism for die.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.401]  Now this is the way they operate, folks.
[00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:31.962]  They take the long view.
[00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:44.493]  And since I left high school, they have been pushing successive generations increasingly into this climate fear, indoctrinating them, propagandizing them.
[00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:48.216]  That is the purpose of government control of the schools.
[00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:50.537]  It is not to make independent thinkers.
[00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:52.958]  It is not to give you the tools of education.
[00:16:53.458 --> 00:17:00.480]  It is to make you dependent on the government to get you to swallow whatever narrative they are selling you at the moment.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.481]  And the narrative that they're selling everybody is climate change or global warming.
[00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.021]  They had to change it to climate change.
[00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:14.403]  And they're saying it's not going to work for the older people, but it will eventually happen because the children belong to them.
[00:17:15.123 --> 00:17:37.193]  They've had the children from a very early age, and they've been teaching your children, if you put them in a government institution, they've been teaching them to worship the environment, to worship the earth, telling them that a catastrophe is coming, and the only way that we can avoid that is to shut down Western society, to shut down our energy, to enter a new dark age, quite literally a dark age.
[00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:38.293]  Turn out the lights, folks.
[00:17:38.654 --> 00:17:39.034]  It's over.
[00:17:39.574 --> 00:17:43.536]  And we're going to reduce your population, we're going to control everything that you have to say.
[00:17:43.556 --> 00:17:49.599]  Now when we come back, I've got a little bit of time left on this, but we're going to talk about violent privilege.
[00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:51.140]  Violent privilege.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.021]  You know, there's certain groups that have a violent privilege, don't they?
[00:17:55.602 --> 00:18:06.047]  Individuals from these groups can commit very heinous crimes, but the government will cover that up because they don't want that to reflect poorly on the group.
[00:18:06.747 --> 00:18:09.969]  And so the left has its violent privilege that it gives to Islam.
[00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:13.671]  And the right has its violent privilege that it gives to the police.
[00:18:14.192 --> 00:18:22.437]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about how those two have converged in Minnesota in the Somali cop that shot the lady.
[00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:27.160]  And of course, that is one of many incidents that have happened in Minneapolis.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.924]  And it shows just how the direction of law enforcement has gone off the rails.
[00:18:33.464 --> 00:18:42.620]  As we've had many police say, you're always going to have bad people in any institution, but if you don't purge the bad people out, then the institution itself becomes corrupt.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.682]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:05.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:04.423]  I'm good.
[00:23:16.203 --> 00:23:16.703]  Welcome back.
[00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:21.544]  I said at the end of the last segment that we're going to talk about violent privilege.
[00:23:22.284 --> 00:23:28.846]  And this gets to the heart of the way we're now seeing everyone as a group, not as individuals.
[00:23:29.766 --> 00:23:33.887]  Our government gives certain groups a violent privilege.
[00:23:34.407 --> 00:23:36.067]  Those on the left like to do it for Islam.
[00:23:36.087 --> 00:23:37.808]  Those on the right like to do it for the police.
[00:23:37.888 --> 00:23:43.669]  Instead of treating individuals who commit violent acts as criminals and dealing with them appropriately,
[00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:46.891]  Some individuals will want to blame the entire group.
[00:23:47.572 --> 00:23:54.537]  Other individuals will want to excuse the violent perpetrator so that the group doesn't get any blame for anything.
[00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:56.299]  So we have these two examples.
[00:23:56.339 --> 00:24:04.486]  We need to make sure that we identify the bad actors in individual groups and institutions and purge them out, and that's especially true of the police.
[00:24:05.086 --> 00:24:15.872]  And when I talked about the privileged characters and privileged groups of Islam and the police, the two of those come together in this story that happened about a week ago in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:24:16.232 --> 00:24:20.075]  And of course we've seen other prior shootings, the shooting of Philando Castile.
[00:24:20.615 --> 00:24:27.760]  A horrendous murder by the police there, showing that there is systemic problem in the police force there that needs to be addressed.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.701]  And we've seen this in other states as well.
[00:24:29.881 --> 00:24:35.545]  In New Mexico, we saw several individuals shot and killed without reason, unnecessarily.
[00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:37.366]  There was no threat to the police lives.
[00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:50.455]  And then we found out as things were going on, and we started to take a look at what was happening in New Mexico, we had an instructor with a state police academy say, you have changed the way we teach our new police officers.
[00:24:50.956 --> 00:25:00.849]  And I refuse to teach this, as an individual who had taught in a police academy for decades, that I refuse to teach this new curriculum because it is a shoot first curriculum.
[00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:02.130]  We're going to talk about how that works.
[00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.535]  But first of all, remember the story that we had, the young lady from Australia?
[00:25:06.806 --> 00:25:09.268]  Who had moved to Minneapolis to marry an American.
[00:25:09.548 --> 00:25:13.712]  She called 911 to report what she thought might be a rape in progress.
[00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:23.420]  When the police arrive and she walks up talking to the driver, the individual in the passenger seat pulls out his gun and shoots her dead with a single shot.
[00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:29.305]  Now the one who killed her, Mohammed Noor, was a diversity hire.
[00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:33.971]  Minneapolis has the largest number of Somalis in America.
[00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:38.356]  As a matter of fact, they live in a concentrated area that's called Little Mogadishu.
[00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:46.506]  That is a harbinger of something that could be very dangerous, because we've seen what happens to the Little Mogadishu that is in Sweden, just outside of their capital.
[00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:56.492]  There they have spent tens of millions of dollars to create a fortress for the police who have to be brought in in armored buses to patrol that very violent area.
[00:25:56.512 --> 00:25:58.654]  Something that has been totally foreign to Sweden.
[00:25:59.094 --> 00:26:02.356]  It hasn't gotten that bad in Minneapolis yet but it is getting there.
[00:26:02.376 --> 00:26:09.961]  We've already had a few months ago we had a couple of individuals who were stopped by the police when they looked at their car.
[00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:13.544]  If you remember they found a weapons cache and other destructive things there.
[00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:16.506]  So it's something that we need to be concerned about but they're reaching out
[00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:17.806]  We're good to go.
[00:26:36.448 --> 00:26:40.892]  Now, Hodges had previously called President Trump uniquely pernicious.
[00:26:41.772 --> 00:26:47.757]  She chose the mosque as a location because she believed the city's Muslim community was under attack from the Trump administration.
[00:26:48.218 --> 00:26:56.785]  And she gave this speech in the mosque the day after the deadly terror attack in Manchester, England that left 22 dead and scores more injured.
[00:26:58.686 --> 00:26:59.908]  That was the motivation for it.
[00:27:00.348 --> 00:27:05.935]  She said, cities like Minneapolis and the people who live in them are squarely in Donald Trump's sights.
[00:27:05.975 --> 00:27:10.802]  His agendas of oppression, regression, suppression have no place in Minneapolis.
[00:27:11.282 --> 00:27:13.645]  And we are standing firm in our resistance to it.
[00:27:14.446 --> 00:27:16.609]  And so she hires a diversity cop.
[00:27:17.403 --> 00:27:23.846]  Now interestingly enough, we have individuals who know him in the community, and this is what they had to say.
[00:27:23.906 --> 00:27:36.232]  This is a man who was a neighbor of his, said he is extremely nervous, he's a little bit jumpy, he doesn't really respect women, the least thing you say to him can set him off.
[00:27:36.812 --> 00:27:38.494]  And this individual was Chris Miller.
[00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:39.376]  He's a forklift driver, 49.
[00:27:39.836 --> 00:27:41.779]  He's lived next door for the past two years.
[00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:48.267]  He said he wasn't surprised to learn that Mohamed Noor was the cop who shot the lady.
[00:27:48.308 --> 00:27:51.512]  She said, when they say a policeman shot an Australian lady, I thought, uh-oh.
[00:27:51.532 --> 00:27:54.135]  But then when they said who it was, I was like, yeah, OK.
[00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:58.559]  He said Nora was a strict, ill-tempered presence in the townhouse block.
[00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:05.604]  He said he got into it with the kids, they were outside playing, something got stuck in a tree, he came out, they just started yelling at the kids because they were out here playing.
[00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:06.664]  And this is the key.
[00:28:06.944 --> 00:28:08.806]  He said he has little respect for women.
[00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:11.207]  He has little respect for blacks and kids.
[00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:16.311]  He has had, in the two years he's been with the force, three complaints filed against him.
[00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:19.633]  One of them has been closed and is sealed, so we can't see it.
[00:28:19.693 --> 00:28:21.374]  But the other two involve women.
[00:28:21.754 --> 00:28:25.036]  This woman who called 9-1-1 and was killed this last week.
[00:28:25.476 --> 00:28:29.939]  Another call to 9-1-1 by a woman reporting what she thought was a crime.
[00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:33.701]  They investigated and later he came back, got very rough with the woman.
[00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:39.445]  She is suing them for excessive use of force, drug her down to be mentally evaluated.
[00:28:40.265 --> 00:28:49.913]  So, it looks like there's a pattern of behavior, which again, because he's a cop in Minneapolis, and especially a Somali cop, nothing is going to be done to him.
[00:28:50.193 --> 00:28:51.454]  He is a privileged character.
[00:28:52.255 --> 00:28:55.938]  And he is now refusing to give a statement to investigators.
[00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:57.119]  He reported that two days ago.
[00:28:57.639 --> 00:29:00.902]  Now, the issue is, what really happened?
[00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:04.485]  And so, body cameras would be very useful in something like that, wouldn't they?
[00:29:04.505 --> 00:29:08.629]  As a matter of fact, body cameras were mandated after the murder of Philando Castile.
[00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:17.851]  And so these two officers, who apparently forgot to turn on their body camera, are in violation of the rules and could be terminated.
[00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:27.174]  They say the police policies reveal that he and his partner, Matthew Herity, breached department rules by not having his body cam switched on as soon as they arrived at the scene.
[00:29:27.454 --> 00:29:34.496]  They must be activated prior to any use of force, quote-unquote, and before any citizen contact, says the policy.
[00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:43.848]  She had called 9-1-1, reported a possible rape, which meant that they needed to have their body cameras turned on as they arrived at the location.
[00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:47.133]  And interestingly enough, nothing has been said about a dash camera.
[00:29:47.894 --> 00:29:50.457]  And when we look at what happened just this last week...
[00:29:51.098 --> 00:29:59.661]  It's been Philando Castile who was murdered, he said, he was pulled over 52 times in a short period of time by police for minor traffic violations, a black man.
[00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:09.124]  He said, I'm a concealed carry holder and the cop got very nervous about it, wound up shooting him seven times when he told the guy to get his license out of his pocket.
[00:30:09.784 --> 00:30:12.025]  And then he used that in his fear to shoot him.
[00:30:12.205 --> 00:30:15.966]  Exactly what we see with this other individual, Mohammed Noor.
[00:30:16.387 --> 00:30:22.169]  A very unstable, abusive person, who really doesn't have the temperament to be part of the police.
[00:30:22.209 --> 00:30:26.070]  We used to, my wife and I, raise puppies for Guiding Eyes for the Blind.
[00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.611]  And one of the things that they would do would be to evaluate the temperament of the puppies.
[00:30:30.152 --> 00:30:33.113]  So they would have these puppies taken around by their trainers.
[00:30:33.133 --> 00:30:38.575]  When they would come around the corner, they would spring open an umbrella in their face, or they would set off a loud noise.
[00:30:39.443 --> 00:30:46.226]  And if the dog got afraid or attacked, then they would flunk the program.
[00:30:46.246 --> 00:30:47.006]  They would remove them.
[00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:51.068]  We need to have the same kinds of control for our police.
[00:30:51.368 --> 00:30:56.550]  And here is a cop who goes off on a couple of dogs who are walking up to him.
[00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:05.954]  He did have his body camera footage going and you can see two dogs walking up to this police officer and then being shot by the police officer.
[00:31:06.394 --> 00:31:11.376]  One of them multiple times, one of them in the face as they're wagging their tails and approaching him.
[00:31:12.016 --> 00:31:16.998]  Meanwhile, The Washington Post is only worried about Islamophobia.
[00:31:17.718 --> 00:31:21.679]  They say they're more concerned about mean tweets and criticisms of Islam than actual shooting.
[00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.340]  This is a Paul Watson story.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.842]  Ignoring the history of this particular officer, ignoring the history of the Minneapolis Police Department,
[00:31:30.785 --> 00:31:36.449]  They are worried that Islamophobia is going to be springing up in the criticism of this.
[00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.032]  Meanwhile, we have face recognition coming to police body cameras.
[00:31:40.372 --> 00:31:55.082]  If you think that it is dangerous now, wait until they add another level of uncertainty, another level that may be a false identification, identifying you as someone else who would be a danger to the police.
[00:31:55.683 --> 00:31:59.466]  Do you think they'll feel justified in terms of shooting first under those conditions?
[00:32:00.186 --> 00:32:01.087]  Absolutely they will.
[00:32:01.707 --> 00:32:12.436]  And of course, they're now using, as Kit Daniels reported a couple of days ago, they're now using this to push for gun control, in spite of the fact that it was the police who shot this lady.
[00:32:13.256 --> 00:32:23.505]  She called them, she had trust in them, she has worked with anti-gun groups in the past, and yet CBS blamed America's notorious culture of gun violence.
[00:32:24.406 --> 00:32:29.373]  No, it is a notorious culture of shoot first training for our police.
[00:32:29.473 --> 00:32:31.896]  And that is coming from Washington.
[00:32:32.037 --> 00:32:33.419]  It's coming from the federal government.
[00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:35.782]  They are the ones who are militarizing our police.
[00:32:36.082 --> 00:32:40.488]  They are the ones who, across this nation, in every state, not just in Minnesota,
[00:32:41.129 --> 00:32:42.691]  Teaching the police to shoot first.
[00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:47.257]  Telling them, you're justified if you're afraid to shoot people and then ask questions later.
[00:32:47.818 --> 00:32:49.941]  That is what we have to stop for all of our goods.
[00:32:50.281 --> 00:32:57.571]  And not to allow the police or Muslims or any other violent individuals to get a pass because of the group they belong to.
[00:32:57.631 --> 00:32:58.633]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.

[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.708]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:06.195 --> 00:37:07.816]  Scott Pressler is an activist.
[00:37:08.036 --> 00:37:11.557]  He is also the vice chairman of the Virginia Beach Young Republicans.
[00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:16.339]  And I first noticed Scott on Twitter with his handle, hashtag, The Persistence.
[00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:17.979]  He was getting a lot of retweets.
[00:37:17.999 --> 00:37:19.180]  He was getting a lot of mentions.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.001]  So then I followed him and I realized that what Scott is doing is actually brilliant.
[00:37:23.421 --> 00:37:28.283]  Now, we'll get into some of the work he's been doing to help conservatives, help the Trump movement.
[00:37:28.723 --> 00:37:30.903]  But first, let's talk about Scott's story.
[00:37:30.963 --> 00:37:37.325]  Now, Scott is a former Democrat, and when he came out as a Republican, he faced a lot of hate.
[00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:40.385]  We're going to talk to Scott now about why he got that hate.
[00:37:40.445 --> 00:37:42.186]  I'm now joined by Scott Pressler.
[00:37:42.206 --> 00:37:43.446]  Scott, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:45.146]  Thank you.
[00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:47.167]  Well, I do want to make one thing clear.
[00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:52.928]  I've always been conservative-leaning, so I definitely was never a liberal Democrat.
[00:37:54.096 --> 00:38:13.254]  Okay, so the story here is, though, you decided to voice your support for Trump, and that's when people started looking at you as a conservative and wanting to demonize you, and specifically that's because you're a member of the LGBTQ community, and it's amazing.
[00:38:13.274 --> 00:38:16.677]  They claim that they're tolerant, yet that's not the response you've gotten.
[00:38:18.086 --> 00:38:18.586]  That's right.
[00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:27.853]  Well, you know, it's so funny because from the left, you know, we hear all about their virtue signaling and we hear about that they're so virtuous and that love trumps hate.
[00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:39.202]  And yet you have someone like me from the LGBTQ community and I have been such an advocate for our community and for helping to protect us from violence and from radical Islamic terror.
[00:38:39.722 --> 00:38:47.096]  And yet, if you have a difference of opinion from the left or from the community as a whole, you're automatically seen as a bigot.
[00:38:47.417 --> 00:38:51.624]  You are the pariah of society, and that's pretty much what I've been demonized as.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.743]  And this is something that you've seen on Twitter.
[00:38:55.843 --> 00:39:05.335]  This is something that you've specifically had people, you know, upset with you just because they figure, well, if you're gay, then you have to be a Democrat.
[00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:07.578]  If you're gay, you can't like Trump.
[00:39:07.738 --> 00:39:08.719]  That's not possible.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.383]  And so they hate you because you're smashing that paradigm.
[00:39:12.438 --> 00:39:13.058]  That's right.
[00:39:13.358 --> 00:39:15.259]  And it's not just the gay community.
[00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:16.339]  It's with everything.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:29.964]  If you're a woman, if you're a black person, if you're a Hispanic, if you're gay, if you are different than from what the Democrat Party tells you that you should be, you're automatically the enemy.
[00:39:30.124 --> 00:39:34.586]  And that's why so many of us are leaving the Democrat Party in droves.
[00:39:35.006 --> 00:39:37.527]  We are tired of identity politics.
[00:39:37.607 --> 00:39:39.848]  We are tired of being boxed in.
[00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:46.530]  We are tired of being told what we can and can't do, and that's why so many people are joining the Republican Party.
[00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:53.872]  We want independence, not dependence on government, not people telling us what we can and can't do.
[00:39:54.312 --> 00:40:00.474]  We want true choice and true freedom, something that the Democrats do not stand for.
[00:40:01.334 --> 00:40:08.596]  Now, were you receiving this type of hate and people tweeting at you on social media and these type of comments before you came out for Trump?
[00:40:10.006 --> 00:40:11.187]  No.
[00:40:11.207 --> 00:40:15.391]  I had never been told from people that ISIS should throw me off of a building.
[00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:19.194]  I had never been told from people that I should get AIDS and die.
[00:40:19.214 --> 00:40:28.742]  I have never been told from people that I am a self-loathing, self-hating, bigoted gay person.
[00:40:28.922 --> 00:40:33.526]  So no, I was not receiving those comments prior to coming out as a gay conservative.
[00:40:33.846 --> 00:40:49.077]  Well, and we'll debunk all those claims against you here in a moment, but that's an amazing story to me, because what they're going to tell you is that Trump supporters are anti-gay, anti-this, anti-that, full of hate, but here you are, a living example of somebody
[00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:53.078]  Who was just minding your own business, living your life as a gay man.
[00:40:53.198 --> 00:40:55.898]  You liked the Democrats, you know, somewhat politically involved.
[00:40:55.918 --> 00:40:57.718]  You always wanted to be a human rights activist.
[00:40:57.738 --> 00:40:59.599]  I think that's something that's always been a passion of yours.
[00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:03.079]  But then all of a sudden, you come out for Trump.
[00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:04.220]  You say, hey, I'm gonna support Trump.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:11.941]  And then all of this hate that they told you was there, that was never there, all of a sudden was there from the people that told you that it was those people doing it.
[00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:14.001]  Precisely.
[00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:17.962]  And so then, but tell me though, were you shocked though by the response that you got?
[00:41:19.517 --> 00:41:20.057]  Definitely.
[00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:24.660]  I was shocked because it was a paradigm switch.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:31.323]  I didn't expect the Republican Party and the Trump community to be so loving and accepting and welcoming.
[00:41:31.883 --> 00:41:39.607]  And I never, ever expected the Democrats to send me the hateful, bigoted death threats that they sent to me.
[00:41:39.947 --> 00:41:41.188]  I never expected that.
[00:41:41.628 --> 00:41:51.739]  And so, you know, as I mentioned in the Daily Caller article, it was the best day of my life, and it was the worst day of my life, because that's when the hell started from the other side.
[00:41:52.759 --> 00:42:06.110]  Well, it's amazing to me, again, and the story is highlighted here in the Daily Caller, talking about how when you came out, you know, I guess, okay, you could say when you came out as a gay Trump supporter, you were really just doing your thing, just tweeting.
[00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.392]  It's not like you made some grand-oise statement here, grandstanding.
[00:42:09.712 --> 00:42:13.315]  It was just you being yourself, and then they had to label you as the gay Trump supporter.
[00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:15.377]  They had to label you as that guy that came out
[00:42:15.957 --> 00:42:18.098]  When really, you were always the guy that was conservative.
[00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:20.300]  You may have just been leaning with the Democrat Party.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.322]  But regardless, the hate and the claims against you was probably something that shocked you, but it was nice.
[00:42:25.623 --> 00:42:28.744]  You're telling me that you got so much support from the Trump community.
[00:42:29.145 --> 00:42:31.326]  And I want to go forward here now.
[00:42:32.776 --> 00:42:35.558]  You know, you honestly, dude, you are like a hero, man.
[00:42:36.278 --> 00:42:43.943]  Scott does something that I have not seen or heard anyone do, ever, in political activism, in the Trump movement, in any movement.
[00:42:44.524 --> 00:42:47.766]  Scott actually goes out into his community and picks up trash.
[00:42:48.206 --> 00:42:52.269]  Scott actually makes his community great by cleaning it up, by picking up trash.
[00:42:52.709 --> 00:43:00.895]  I mean, and not only that, you also wear, you know, a Trump sign on your back or you wear a Trump flag or a Trump hat a lot of these times when you're doing it.
[00:43:01.315 --> 00:43:02.496]  What gave you that idea?
[00:43:04.077 --> 00:43:10.380]  You know, I have wanted to make a change ever since President Obama was re-elected.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:20.805]  And actually, I created my Twitter account the day of his re-election because I thought to myself, I can sit at home and complain, or I can go do something about it.
[00:43:20.945 --> 00:43:22.046]  I can be a change.
[00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.767]  I can affect change in the world.
[00:43:24.307 --> 00:43:29.310]  And you know, there is so much negativity going on right now from the left and in general.
[00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:33.192]  I want to be a spot of hope.
[00:43:33.612 --> 00:43:40.635]  I want to send a message of inspiration and motivation and enthusiasm and excitement and positivity.
[00:43:41.075 --> 00:43:43.757]  And that's why I go out and run with my Trump sign.
[00:43:43.797 --> 00:43:46.658]  That's why I go out into my community and pick up trash.
[00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:52.060]  I'm not going to focus on the negativity and I'm not going to focus on people who are going to try to bring me down.
[00:43:52.381 --> 00:43:53.941]  They're always going to try to do that.
[00:43:54.362 --> 00:43:57.143]  I'm going to continue being persistent
[00:43:57.843 --> 00:44:06.127]  And moving in the right direction to support the president's national security agenda and making sure that we are defeating Democrats in 2018.
[00:44:06.427 --> 00:44:08.628]  I am focused and my eyes are on the prize 100%.
[00:44:11.067 --> 00:44:17.451]  Well, the truth of the matter is, I know, speaking for myself, I couldn't, I don't care whether you're gay or straight or whatever.
[00:44:18.152 --> 00:44:21.594]  We're in this political movement together to try to make America great again.
[00:44:21.894 --> 00:44:26.357]  But it's amazing to me because, as you said, it's the left that wants to play identity politics.
[00:44:26.377 --> 00:44:27.959]  They're the one that wants to put you in this box.
[00:44:28.219 --> 00:44:28.719]  So fine.
[00:44:28.979 --> 00:44:30.100]  So we'll put you in the box.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.081]  Look at Scott.
[00:44:31.461 --> 00:44:32.522]  How can you hate Scott?
[00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:34.463]  He is out actually picking up trash.
[00:44:34.703 --> 00:44:36.164]  He cares about the community.
[00:44:36.184 --> 00:44:39.687]  I mean, it's just amazing to me that they would pick you as a target
[00:44:40.407 --> 00:44:43.448]  Somebody who's actually out on the streets helping the community every day.
[00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:53.971]  Another thing that you're doing as a form of your activism and what you said, I'm quoting the Daily Caller article now, we are keeping the Trump momentum and keeping Republicans and Trump voters united.
[00:44:54.331 --> 00:45:03.453]  I'm writing handwritten thank you letters to Trump voters and tailoring messages to remind them to get out there and vote on November 6, 2018 for the candidate and their state.
[00:45:03.753 --> 00:45:07.394]  And I'm challenging them to spread the message to their friends and family.
[00:45:07.714 --> 00:45:09.855]  Talk about that experience, writing these people.
[00:45:09.975 --> 00:45:12.284]  Getting this personal communication, this personal touch.
[00:45:12.304 --> 00:45:12.966]  What's that been like?
[00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:14.612]  That's right.
[00:45:14.693 --> 00:45:16.158]  Well, you know I've been really blessed.
[00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:21.718]  And the past year I've gained 100,000 followers on Twitter.
[00:45:21.898 --> 00:45:24.500]  And I think people really trust me and they respect me.
[00:45:25.001 --> 00:45:26.642]  And so I made a simple tweet.
[00:45:26.942 --> 00:45:27.682]  I said, you know what?
[00:45:27.822 --> 00:45:31.325]  If you want a Trump sticker, I will mail one to you for free.
[00:45:31.925 --> 00:45:35.588]  And hundreds and hundreds of emails have poured into me.
[00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:46.395]  And so every single day I sit at a coffee shop and I sit there with my headphones in listening to music, you know, videos like yours of you owning the left, which are hilarious.
[00:45:46.975 --> 00:45:47.155]  Yes.
[00:46:10.748 --> 00:46:13.771]  This relationship that we've had up until this election, alive.
[00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.912]  We have formed a family.
[00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:18.294]  This is so much more than just politics.
[00:46:18.494 --> 00:46:22.457]  All these people that I have on my Twitter, we are a family.
[00:46:22.618 --> 00:46:26.100]  And I think that's what brings us so close, is we just relate to each other.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:30.964]  From people from 16-year-old, from my friend in Dallas, to 80-year-olds.
[00:46:31.384 --> 00:46:33.346]  We're all united plus together.
[00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:34.489]  Yeah, and it doesn't matter.
[00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:36.250]  Again, the left wants to play identity politics.
[00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:37.270]  Pick an identity.
[00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.871]  You can find all of them inside of the Trump movement.
[00:46:40.171 --> 00:46:41.271]  That is Scott Pressler.
[00:46:41.311 --> 00:46:43.131]  Hashtag the persistence on Twitter.
[00:46:43.431 --> 00:46:44.292]  He's a great follow.
[00:46:44.352 --> 00:46:44.852]  Reach out to him.
[00:46:44.872 --> 00:46:45.432]  Send him a letter.
[00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:46.532]  He might send you a Trump sticker.
[00:46:46.812 --> 00:46:48.713]  Or you might see him picking up trash in your community.
[00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:50.093]  The Daily Caller said it.
[00:46:50.293 --> 00:46:56.975]  Democrats should be worried about this young Republican, Scott Pressler, because he smashes the paradigm and unites America.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.760]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:10.021]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.402 --> 00:47:15.404]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:21.207]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.587 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.513]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:59.081]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.101 --> 00:48:59.962]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:00.022]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.482 --> 00:49:13.087]  The Trump administration announced that it is ending a covert CIA operation that sought to arm the Syrian rebels.
[00:49:13.507 --> 00:49:20.913]  And of course, this has immediately got the Warhawks and the Deep State circling, saying this is further evidence that Trump is Putin's puppet.
[00:49:21.493 --> 00:49:27.595]  The covert CIA program they were training and arming Syrian rebels to fight the government of Bashar al-Assad.
[00:49:28.116 --> 00:49:39.000]  The decision to phase out this Obama-era program was reportedly made by Trump during a White House meeting last month with CIA Director Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor H.R.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.600]  McMaster.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:50.088]  But not even an aggressive form of brain cancer can stop Senator John McCain from rising from his hospital bed to demonize and denounce the Trump administration.
[00:49:50.449 --> 00:49:56.374]  He issued a statement saying that Trump is playing into Putin's hands by canceling the Syrian rebel program.
[00:49:57.054 --> 00:50:06.278]  And he further criticized Trump, saying, making any concession to Russia, absent a broader strategy for Syria, is irresponsible and short-sighted.
[00:50:06.538 --> 00:50:11.760]  Now, of course, this Syrian rebel program is one that Senator John McCain is personally invested in.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.603]  He and Lindsey Graham and others actually aggressively sought to get the Obama administration to arm the Syrian rebels.
[00:50:18.803 --> 00:50:21.124]  Who we later learned were defecting to ISIS.
[00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:25.007]  That, my friend, is irresponsible and short-sighted.
[00:50:25.347 --> 00:50:28.288]  So, of course, John McCain would see this as a personal affront.
[00:50:28.308 --> 00:50:32.211]  Let's not forget he visited Syria to meet with rebel leadership.
[00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:34.252]  Rebel leaders called on the U.S.
[00:50:34.312 --> 00:50:45.178]  to step up its support to the Syrian armed opposition and provide them with heavy weapons, a no-fly zone, and airstrikes on the Syrian regime and the forces of Hezbollah.
[00:50:45.478 --> 00:50:51.663]  And then of course, upon return, McCain and Lindsey Graham called for the United States to arm the Syrian rebels.
[00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:59.350]  McCain said at the time, I believe there are ways to get weapons to the opposition without direct United States involvement.
[00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:06.196]  So I am not only not opposed, but I am in favor of weapons being obtained by the opposition.
[00:51:06.616 --> 00:51:17.861]  So this was Senator John McCain, who played a very vocal role in arming these rebels, who of course, 3,000 moderate rebels defecting to ISIS, U.S.
[00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:23.424]  preparing 5,000 more, even though their rebel army is defecting to ISIS.
[00:51:23.504 --> 00:51:29.947]  And this is not just InfoWars reporting, it's Al Jazeera, Syrian rebel groups defect from Western-backed opposition.
[00:51:30.307 --> 00:51:34.969]  International Business Times says U.S.-backed moderate Syrian rebels in the north defect.
[00:51:35.629 --> 00:51:37.871]  Obama's strategy set back.
[00:51:38.611 --> 00:51:38.932]  U.S.
[00:51:39.132 --> 00:51:42.754]  accidentally delivered weapons to the Islamic State by airdrop.
[00:51:43.315 --> 00:51:43.475]  Ah!
[00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:46.397]  ISIS apparently takes control of U.S.
[00:51:46.517 --> 00:51:48.919]  weapons airdrop intended for the Kurds.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:49.740]  Oops!
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.081]  Accidental drop by the Pentagon.
[00:51:52.502 --> 00:51:54.783]  They admit 28 loads missing.
[00:51:54.904 --> 00:51:56.144]  They blame the wind.
[00:51:56.645 --> 00:51:58.326]  I'm sorry, but I highly doubt that our U.S.
[00:51:58.366 --> 00:52:03.210]  military is that inept that they would drop 28 loads because of the wind.
[00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:09.998]  I'm pretty sure they've been dropping loads for quite some time in the desert and they are able to account for the wind.
[00:52:10.358 --> 00:52:15.244]  Let's take a look at the Washington Post and see what they have to say about President Trump's decision.
[00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:22.772]  A move sought by Moscow.
[00:52:22.952 --> 00:52:31.054]  This program was a central plank of a policy begun by the Obama administration in 2013 to put pressure on Assad to step aside.
[00:52:31.374 --> 00:52:38.436]  Officials say the phasing out of the secret program reflects Trump's interest in finding ways to work with Russia.
[00:52:38.876 --> 00:52:46.038]  So ending a covert CIA scheme to arm jihadis is a bad thing because it's what Putin wants.
[00:52:46.658 --> 00:53:03.945]  Now, this is, of course, a great time to remind everyone that The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, he has a $600 million contract with the CIA for cloud services, set to make a small fortune from the intelligence agencies that are, of course, his top clients there at Amazon.
[00:53:04.365 --> 00:53:05.906]  What else is in Putin's interest?
[00:53:06.026 --> 00:53:08.027]  Well, apparently stopping the rise of ISIS.
[00:53:08.687 --> 00:53:11.569]  And that's according to former Secretary of State John Kerry.
[00:53:11.709 --> 00:53:14.851]  The Obama administration saw the rise of ISIS.
[00:53:14.911 --> 00:53:22.376]  They could see that Daesh was gaining power, gaining control in the region, that they were successful at fighting the presidency of Bashar al-Assad.
[00:53:22.856 --> 00:53:26.778]  And so the administration did nothing, according to John Kerry.
[00:53:26.818 --> 00:53:30.140]  They kind of stepped back and watched to allow
[00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.462]  The Islamic State to gain traction.
[00:53:33.623 --> 00:53:35.664]  They could use that as leverage against Assad.
[00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:38.365]  This was according to some leaked audio captures.
[00:53:38.706 --> 00:53:43.768]  It was a closed door discussion with Syrian activists on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
[00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:46.010]  It wasn't about helping the Syrian people.
[00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.571]  It was about regime change.
[00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:51.894]  Based on this very damning leaked audio, we know that the U.S.
[00:53:51.934 --> 00:54:01.663]  government was well aware that Russian intervention in Syria was for the express purpose of destroying ISIS, from stopping the group, from taking over the country.
[00:54:02.084 --> 00:54:03.345]  Yet at the same time, the U.S.
[00:54:03.385 --> 00:54:06.688]  government is watching the rise of ISIS, and they're sitting back.
[00:54:07.068 --> 00:54:22.034]  And allowing ISIS to attack Assad because the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and they were hoping that Assad would be forced to capitulate to ISIS, this would open the door to forcing Assad to have to negotiate with the United States.
[00:54:22.655 --> 00:54:26.156]  This effectively makes ISIS a proxy U.S.
[00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:29.578]  military force who would then overthrow a legitimate government.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:49.343]  We're here in downtown Dallas, Texas for the Flyover America Tour where we're going to be talking to deplorables and your everyday Americans out there in flyover country.
[00:54:50.384 --> 00:54:54.609]  Pretty cool people meeting each other, InfoWars listeners meeting each other, networking.
[00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:56.851]  My red pill experience would have been
[00:54:58.226 --> 00:55:05.091]  Getting hold of a copy of Nondare Caller, a conspiracy probably in the late 80s when I was around 12 years old.
[00:55:05.111 --> 00:55:10.376]  Like I said, I grew up in Austin, so I was one of the first, I saw Alex when he first came on.
[00:55:10.416 --> 00:55:13.038]  I was one of his first callers on his access show.
[00:55:13.178 --> 00:55:16.961]  I've been listening to Info Your Voice for probably about 10 years or more.
[00:55:17.441 --> 00:55:19.203]  I started listening to Alex Jones like in 1998.
[00:55:19.283 --> 00:55:19.763]  So to see the whole
[00:55:24.246 --> 00:55:39.059]  To see the whole progress from where he started back then and knowing all the things that I know, all of the things that I've researched, everything that he's ever said that I found interesting, that I've went and researched and found out to be the truth.
[00:55:39.439 --> 00:55:46.826]  I try to listen as often as I can and generally I do it through the podcast because of my job constraints.
[00:55:46.866 --> 00:55:48.047]  I generally work overnight.
[00:55:48.507 --> 00:55:50.149]  What's your favorite part about InfoWars?
[00:55:51.499 --> 00:55:54.141]  When Alex Jones goes crazy about stuff.
[00:55:56.243 --> 00:56:01.208]  Cause when he gets real mad about stuff and the Tuck Buckford, I just like laugh.
[00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.332]  As far as Donald Trump and deplorables go.
[00:56:07.867 --> 00:56:25.440]  Just, uh, I guess the thing is the way that the, uh, I guess the Democrats or leftists have been, uh, just so haughty and, uh, snobbish, I guess is the best word to say about, uh, what, what they would call deplorables or really just Americans.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:33.606]  Probably about a year before the election, I kept hearing all these negative things about Trump and I just,
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.924]  It just didn't really make a lot of sense because I hadn't heard him, Trump, say a whole lot of things.
[00:56:40.504 --> 00:56:45.588]  So I wanted to find out more about, okay, if he's really this horrible person, what's, what's a lot of the stuff?
[00:56:45.648 --> 00:56:48.050]  And I just had a hard time finding it.
[00:56:48.070 --> 00:57:04.084]  That's about when I bumped into Alex Jones and he started kind of having the same kind of sentiments toward it and kind of realizing, that's when I kind of realized more of the whole matrix and how, you know, a lot of the mainstream media, it's a lot more pronounced now, but how, just how,
[00:57:05.484 --> 00:57:08.767]  Awful they are and how skewed it was against Trump.
[00:57:09.207 --> 00:57:15.192]  So I'm Native American, like I said, and for whatever reason, we didn't have to comply with Obamacare.
[00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:20.656]  And so I didn't face the big fines, but my wife did.
[00:57:21.497 --> 00:57:25.039]  And we had to pay somewhere around $1,500 to $1,800 every year that it was
[00:57:30.177 --> 00:57:31.639]  We don't want to pay for insurance.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:38.486]  We eat healthy, we buy the products at Info Wars, and we stay active.
[00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:40.548]  It was a burden.
[00:57:41.269 --> 00:57:41.930]  It cost us...
[00:57:43.409 --> 00:57:47.630]  Hundreds of dollars a year, close to several thousand a year, and we don't want it.
[00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:49.770]  I changed careers.
[00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:50.930]  I moved on.
[00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:58.092]  I went and got my commercial driver's license, and from there, the industry that I was in was car parts.
[00:57:58.732 --> 00:58:05.993]  And after Obama's, you know, pretty much war on, you know, old cars with his cash for clunkers deal, that it pretty much destroyed everything.
[00:58:06.493 --> 00:58:10.454]  And from there, it just spiraled out of control, and I decided to
[00:58:10.934 --> 00:58:13.719]  I wanted to get a job where I could actually travel and actually see America.
[00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:17.926]  I've been awoke since I became a Christian in 1986.
[00:58:18.086 --> 00:58:23.194]  I was raised in Germany by a socialist politician.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:28.282]  So, yeah, that's basically what I wanted to say.
[00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:42.168]  You better keep your guns, because these guys, they like their position of power, and it's best just to do like the Founding Fathers said, and have the right to bear arms.
[00:58:42.328 --> 00:58:44.409]  It's America.
[00:58:44.489 --> 00:58:45.589]  It's America.
[00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:48.470]  We good over here.
[00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.071]  We good.
[00:58:53.117 --> 00:58:54.178]  That's it for tonight's news.
