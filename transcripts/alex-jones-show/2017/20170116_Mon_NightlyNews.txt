[00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.839]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.443]  It is Monday, January 16th, 2017.
[00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.025]  I'm your host, Margaret Howell.
[00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.348]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:33.777]  Good evening.
[00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:41.500]  Dr. Martin Luther King, apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.601]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:50.584]  rolls in his grave as radical leftists plot total chaos at Trump's inauguration.
[00:00:52.304 --> 00:01:00.048]  Meanwhile, Toby Keith says he will not apologize for performing on Friday, as he is honored to be there.
[00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:00.888]  Then,
[00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:04.677]  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:09.320]  If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.624]  Chuck Schumer says he will not cooperate with Trump on putting back together our nation's healthcare system.
[00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:19.165]  We're not going to just go for anything he proposes.
[00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:20.406]  It's going to have to be our bill.
[00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:25.829]  All that plus more ignorance from Hollywood, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:36.953]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:39.236]  We're making freedom go viral.
[00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:44.703]  And now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.623]  That means live coverage of events and breaking news on location as it happens.
[00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:15.503]  I think so.
[00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:07.955]  On Wednesday, January the 18th, scores of radical leftists are planning their devilry.
[00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.616]  We know this because of a leaked tape.
[00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:15.200]  Leigh-Anne, if you can believe this, I know Alex has covered it and so has Owen this morning, and you guys talked about it briefly.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:29.289]  You hear this propagandist voice talk about how they've got these mass chaotic events planned with starting points, locations, and the absolute ridiculousness of this where they just want to create this chaos.
[00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:30.810]  They are planning terror attacks.
[00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.351]  That's exactly.
[00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:37.734]  Terror attacks in Washington, D.C., that's the definition of a terror attack, is to terrorize people for political ends.
[00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:43.417]  They're actually on this video talking about deploying buriatic acid at the deplorable.
[00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:48.980]  They're talking about, okay, so these ball crushing, Operation Ball Crusher is what it's called.
[00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:53.243]  No pun intended with that because they literally are trying to attack an inaugural ball.
[00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:54.443]  I was just in D.C.
[00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.204]  this weekend myself, and you can see police barricades going up.
[00:03:57.644 --> 00:04:01.085]  It is being locked down like Fort Knox right now in preparation for this.
[00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:06.727]  We've covered, you know, this inside scoop of how they're going to try to take down and create as much chaos as possible.
[00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:23.432]  Meanwhile, members on Capitol Hill that are of a certain party, and I really hate to be divisive, so I'm not going to name them out, but 20 of them are calling for this sit-out of Trump's inauguration, like bratty, petulant children that lost, and so we're just going to stay
[00:04:24.052 --> 00:04:42.702]  Right, well you can see, you know, if that's what their leaders are doing, if the leaders within, there at the Capitol, if they're also going to be doing a lot of this infighting, well then it trickles down to the people in the street, and of course, you know, they said that they are going to do everything they possibly can to try and stop people from being able to access the inauguration.
[00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:43.803]  They're planning everything.
[00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:48.845]  They're going to put up barricades, they're going to be doing their stop war.
[00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.668]  All day along the parade route.
[00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:56.372]  So after the inauguration itself, they're going to have all these protests going along with the parade.
[00:04:56.392 --> 00:05:00.496]  There's 6,000 participants in this inaugural parade.
[00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:02.438]  So then you're going to have all these anti-protests.
[00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:08.144]  The thing that gets me is that they are calling this anti-fascist protest.
[00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:09.845]  They want to stop anti-fascism.
[00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.567]  And how are they going to go about doing that?
[00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:13.109]  By being fascist.
[00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:22.214]  And of bullying, we had several people have to actually get out from performing in the inauguration because they were receiving death threats.
[00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:26.316]  Andrea Bocelli, the blind tenor, was getting death threats.
[00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:31.479]  And now, of course, one of the singers, Jackie Evancho, she is still going to sing.
[00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.959]  And guess what?
[00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:33.400]  She's got a transgender sister.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.904]  Who also supports the fact that she's planning on singing at Trump's inauguration.
[00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:42.029]  It should be about bringing people together, bringing the countries together, not dividing people.
[00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:49.817]  So, you know, everyone that's there with her, Donald Trump is going to take back LGBT, you know, as far as people, their progress.
[00:05:50.578 --> 00:05:50.899]  No!
[00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.381]  It's freaking mental!
[00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:53.602]  Utter garbage.
[00:05:53.642 --> 00:05:54.203]  They're lies.
[00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:55.224]  They're divisive lies.
[00:05:55.264 --> 00:05:57.607]  They're designed to separate our country, to tear us apart.
[00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:07.300]  And honestly, not only are we seeing planned protests doing this, members of Capitol Hill, even President Obama, members of his own cabinet and agencies, specifically John Brennan,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.603]  He said that Trump's Nazi Germany tweet about U.S.
[00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:12.865]  agencies was outrageous.
[00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:21.893]  He's calling President-elect Trump not legitimate, if you will, which is exactly the same sentiment that Representative John Lewis said regarding Trump.
[00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:31.241]  But meanwhile, if you can only imagine a Republican using the same words that John Lewis has used and John Brennan about Trump, trying to delegitimize him even before he's in office,
[00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:38.225]  We've also seen this out of John Kerry, who called Trump inappropriate for knocking Merkel's refugee policy.
[00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:47.069]  So he's got all of these multi-level attacks happening, trying to make him seem not credible and not legitimate, even prior to assuming office.
[00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:58.876]  And I know you and I talked about this- Meanwhile, this is, you know, President Obama, who went and lectured people in the UK about Brexit, and of course, single-handedly probably caused those people to vote
[00:06:59.156 --> 00:06:59.336]  I think.
[00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.751]  It's absurd.
[00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:22.273]  So, specifically going back to what John Kerry said for a minute, because it is like he's doing a comedic skit.
[00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:26.054]  If you read this, you're like, wait a second, this is not a piece of comedy, he's serious.
[00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:33.998]  I thought, frankly, it was inappropriate for a President-elect of the United States to be stepping into the politics of other countries in quite a direct manner.
[00:07:34.418 --> 00:07:34.878]  Oh really?
[00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.720]  When has that ever bothered you, sir?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:56.614]  You've meddled in Syria, you've meddled in Ukraine, you've meddled all over the world throughout the Middle East running amok, and yet it's not appropriate for a president-elect to comment on the refugee policies of another country, much less try to destabilize them, which is what you and the current administration has done, specifically with Syria.
[00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:58.015]  All he did was comment.
[00:07:58.075 --> 00:07:58.776]  It was just a comment.
[00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:08.723]  Well, and the thing that's just, you know, what people need to realize here, just under sort of a microscopic lens, is that that's what they're doing sort of globally to disrupt and foment this unrest.
[00:08:08.763 --> 00:08:15.867]  But that's the exact same thing that we're seeing now within the inter-workings of our own Congress.
[00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:19.610]  Now, we know that there's always kind of a little bit of roadblock there.
[00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.752]  Everyone's kind of complaining how they never get anything done.
[00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:27.877]  Meanwhile, we've got now the Republicans controlling the House and the Senate and the White House.
[00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:30.859]  So they actually have the opportunity to get some things done.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.605]  But we have the Democrats, basically at least 20 of them that are sitting out Trump's inauguration.
[00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:40.068]  They're basically saying, hey, we're not going to be working with you at all.
[00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.771]  Chuck Schumer came out and said, you know what?
[00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:44.813]  The GOP shouldn't expect any help.
[00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:57.405]  From Schumer or any of the Democrats on the Obamacare replacement, he says, if they want to rip healthcare away from 22 million Americans, they don't get to blame us for not cobbling something back together.
[00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:06.634]  No, first of all, the American people are blaming you for cobbling something together that you said you had to pass it to find out what was in it.
[00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:08.934]  You knew it was going to be such a huge debacle.
[00:09:08.994 --> 00:09:10.335]  It's been a debacle from the beginning.
[00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:18.476]  Donald Trump has said that he doesn't want to repeal everything about the, he'd like to keep some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the things that work.
[00:09:19.376 --> 00:09:19.856]  But you know what?
[00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:24.997]  Frankly, I don't think the GOP wants your help cobbling together a replacement plan.
[00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:27.238]  And in fact, they've got at least six different versions.
[00:09:27.578 --> 00:09:29.258]  Rand Paul has been making the rounds.
[00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:33.559]  He's previewing the Obamacare replacement plan all week this week.
[00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:35.059]  He hit out on CNN today.
[00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:44.925]  And the plan that they are talking about is to get affordable care, actual affordable care to every single American in the United States.
[00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:50.068]  And of course, Donald Trump backed Rand Paul on this, saying we need to repeal and replace on the same day.
[00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:57.112]  So I just think like Chuck Schumer, what a smug comment to make that they need your help.
[00:09:57.332 --> 00:10:03.058]  And they've been begging for this opportunity to show the American people, and I think the American people are going to hold them to account.
[00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:04.619]  Look, you've got all the power.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.602]  All the cards are in your hands right now.
[00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:14.249]  You guys better bring it to the table and show the Democrats we don't need your help, frankly, nor your smug attitude.
[00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:19.270]  Well, he has people like Chuck Schumer on one side that are open about their disdain for Donald Trump.
[00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:26.211]  You know, that we understand that they're enemies of, frankly, of capitalism, of free markets, of people being able to choose what kind of health care they want.
[00:10:26.572 --> 00:10:29.152]  And let's just face it, Obamacare is not affordable.
[00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:35.493]  We know that the premium aspect, for 2017 alone, it is going to be so unaffordable for most Americans.
[00:10:35.553 --> 00:10:41.114]  Premiums are going to skyrocket three times, according to, you know, our own Department of Health.
[00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:43.115]  So, our National Institute for Health, rather.
[00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:44.796]  Every number says.
[00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:46.558]  It is not affordable, Leigh-Anne.
[00:10:46.858 --> 00:11:06.338]  Not only that, we've got Chuck Schumer, which I actually appreciate the fact that you know where he's coming from, but you've got people on the other side of the aisle, like John McCain, Lindsey Graham, you know, people like this Marco Rubio, who are actively trying to stop his confirmations, who are admitting to giving dossiers of information that were fake to the FBI to indict a president before he even takes office.
[00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:21.747]  Who go on, you know, the boob channel, the national boobs, if you will, these two idiots, excuse me, I know we should have respect for our senators, but what they say, it is just impossible to take them seriously, because you think that, I mean, they go on CNN and they try to indict him.
[00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:32.394]  Look, he's got a tough fight ahead of him, but what we do know is we've got the votes in the House and the Senate to repeal and replace Obamacare, and it looks like they're working through the specifics now, which is the best news.
[00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:33.414]  Absolutely.
[00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:54.779]  And what I think is very interesting, you actually had Anderson Cooper kind of taking what John Lewis said, kind of taking him to task, saying when John Lewis said that he doesn't see President-elect Donald Trump as a legitimate president, Anderson Cooper said, you know what, if Republicans had been saying this about President-elect Hillary Clinton, Democrats would be up in arms, which is absolutely the case.
[00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:57.160]  Actually, years ago when they were saying President Obama was
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.241]  An illegitimate president, not legitimate.
[00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.062]  That was racist for you to infer that.
[00:12:03.443 --> 00:12:05.944]  But it's really interesting because let's take a look at that.
[00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:08.645]  Would Hillary Clinton be considered a legitimate president?
[00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:16.208]  Or, you know, we saw from WikiLeaks that the DNC was actively colluding with the mainstream media to get her elected.
[00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:18.209]  They didn't care what the American people wanted.
[00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:22.013]  Uh, but also she was under active FBI investigation.
[00:12:22.454 --> 00:12:27.721]  Now, of course, they were able to kind of close that case against her personally in her private server.
[00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:33.689]  But let's not forget that the Clinton Foundation is actually still under investigation.
[00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.391]  So the Daily Caller... They were scrambling to close it!
[00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.231]  Exactly.
[00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.152]  They can't close the door fast enough!
[00:12:39.512 --> 00:12:40.252]  Like that's gonna matter!
[00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:42.553]  If it was legit and everything was fine, why shut it down?
[00:12:42.613 --> 00:12:43.093]  Exactly.
[00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:49.496]  And we were kind of asking that because they had announced internally in September that they were going to start cutting jobs.
[00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:55.378]  So people that were working with the Clinton Foundation, they started looking for other jobs or accepting other jobs at the time.
[00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:57.019]  And this was kind of in
[00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:00.301]  In the thought that Hillary Clinton was going to get elected.
[00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:15.651]  So they were already shutting it down knowing that there were some issues there because this, like I said, the Clinton Foundation is under active investigation regarding allegations of corruption during the same time that Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:21.875]  So they were shutting it down, but now the Clinton Foundation is laying off 22 staffers.
[00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:23.416]  Heads are beginning to roll.
[00:13:23.696 --> 00:13:25.097]  They're shutting it down entirely.
[00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:28.140]  It's like a fire sale going on right now.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.984]  It's because they know the pay-to-play aspects of Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:32.385 --> 00:13:33.186]  It is absolutely done.
[00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:35.949]  The woman represented Saudi Arabia.
[00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:43.457]  They gave her money to represent their interest while she was pretending to be this advocate for American people, specifically American women and children.
[00:13:43.877 --> 00:13:57.434]  No, my friend, she was actually an advocate for the Saudis, and nothing is more apparent than taking money from these rogue and foreign governments that have serious humanitarian issues, specifically when it comes to women and children taking their money, and they can't close the door fast enough.
[00:13:57.454 --> 00:14:02.080]  The good news is, though, that she has a paper trail behind her that is about 10 years old.
[00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:10.063]  And we might actually see some justice served with that since she's no longer being protected by the Democratic, the DNC and those elites.
[00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:21.026]  But it's interesting how we know with the Saudi Arabian prince coming out saying that he, that they've given at least 20% of Hillary Clinton's campaign funds coming from Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:24.307]  Why weren't they accused of influencing the election?
[00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:28.510]  You know, but instead of the Russians, there is an actual basis, right?
[00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:32.874]  You don't hear Vladimir Putin saying, you know, well, we actively gave the campaign of Donald Trump.
[00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.795]  You know, these are serious issues, folks.
[00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:43.142]  Meanwhile, you have the kingdom saying that they did give to the Clintons and there isn't anything more representative of pay to play with her, you know.
[00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.645]  It's a textbook example of this.
[00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:51.112]  If you look up the dictionary definition of corruption, it's her face with this foundation, literally.
[00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:59.382]  And speaking of the FBI, because I wanted to touch on this really briefly and it's not really related to anything we're talking about, it's just an update to a story that we've covered a lot because of
[00:15:00.123 --> 00:15:05.028]  Because of, you know, our refugee policy, for example, and our mass immigration.
[00:15:05.308 --> 00:15:11.014]  The FBI, speaking of the FBI, they have arrested the wife of the killer in the Orlando mass shooting.
[00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.036]  It's about time.
[00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:13.617]  Exactly.
[00:15:13.677 --> 00:15:23.047]  This Norah Selman, and of course her husband, I'm not even going to say allegedly, because we know that he killed 49 people and wounded dozens in the nightclub.
[00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:28.010]  And she was taken into custody by the FBI outside of her home in San Francisco.
[00:15:28.711 --> 00:15:33.834]  And prosecutors, they're saying that she was obstructing justice in this case.
[00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:41.179]  We saw the same thing with the Faruqs regarding the San Bernardino issue, where the mother-in-law was living in the home, concealing.
[00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:42.620]  Everybody knew around them.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.641]  And what did she know and what is she hiding?
[00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:49.044]  And it looks like they're cracking down on family members now of terrorists.
[00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:50.205]  Because, you know what?
[00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:51.006]  There is a tie.
[00:15:51.026 --> 00:15:51.746]  There is a connection.
[00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:52.727]  Somebody knows something.
[00:15:52.927 --> 00:15:53.807]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:54.888]  I mean, absolutely.
[00:15:55.028 --> 00:15:56.228]  She's his wife.
[00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:58.089]  They're in intimate, close quarters.
[00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:04.311]  And everyone who knew Omar Mateen said that he was always angry, always ranting, very upset.
[00:16:05.092 --> 00:16:10.474]  He didn't try to hide his political beliefs or his ideological beliefs at all whatsoever.
[00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:13.235]  So, of course, his wife is going to understand that as well.
[00:16:14.835 --> 00:16:20.998]  And that's going to be sort of interesting with all of these terroristic attacks that are planned for the inauguration.
[00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:24.781]  It's going to be really interesting to see the type of pushback.
[00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:34.252]  If anything major does happen there, we know ISIS was actually actively calling for terror attacks to happen during the inauguration throughout the United States.
[00:16:34.272 --> 00:16:37.936]  I actually reported last week how there was a
[00:16:40.198 --> 00:17:01.345]  Shootout actually there at the Mexican border in one of these towns where they were saying that ISIS was colluding with with the drug cartels to actually to take on because they you know the enemy my enemy is my friend so obviously they both want to send Donald Trump a message of who's in charge so we really have no idea what's going on so it'll be interesting to see how
[00:17:02.245 --> 00:17:11.129]  These anti-fascist protesters are going to be treated, you know, it's a different sort of thing there when you're making these terror threats.
[00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:14.870]  In DC, during an inauguration, it's a totally different thing.
[00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:21.893]  Don't you find it funny that, okay, so we're talking about the tolerant left, the people that preach political correctness to the nth degree,
[00:17:22.073 --> 00:17:22.253]  Yes.
[00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:44.496]  ISIS would be on the side of liberals because they also think that a secure border is a problem.
[00:17:44.516 --> 00:17:44.837]  You know what?
[00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.018]  They're aligning with ISIS.
[00:17:46.058 --> 00:17:46.979]  That's hilarious.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.061]  And it's not hilarious in a funny way.
[00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:55.829]  It's hilarious in an ironic way that they are aligned with terrorists and they're practicing terrorism.
[00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:56.349]  I think so.
[00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:21.654]  We kind of alluded to Donald Trump talking and his press secretary saying that alternative media and bloggers could become part of the press corps.
[00:18:21.994 --> 00:18:25.936]  We know the White House press corps is like shaking in their boots at that, freaking out.
[00:18:26.036 --> 00:18:30.157]  What do you mean you're going to let the alternative media and bloggers become part of the elite?
[00:18:30.637 --> 00:18:32.958]  You know, are we going to get to go to nerd prom?
[00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:34.899]  Are you going to date a nerd prom there?
[00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:43.603]  So they're freaking out about this and Alex Jones is actually going to be breaking this story tomorrow at 1.30 on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:43.903 --> 00:18:47.065]  He wants to talk about the persecution of the press.
[00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:49.166]  That is going to be a big breaking report.
[00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:51.187]  He's going to have it at 1.30 with a special guest.
[00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:57.751]  And also James O'Keefe with Project Veritas is going to be dropping part two of these explosive videos.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my President shirts, and Hillary for Prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros, the Goblin Globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:22:45.501 --> 00:22:47.563]  Don't let anybody make you think that God
[00:23:09.068 --> 00:23:17.850]  He chose America as his divine messianic force to be, a sort of policeman of the whole world.
[00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:32.914]  God has a way of standing before the nations with judgment, and it seems that I can hear God saying to America, you're too arrogant if you don't change your ways.
[00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:44.505]  I will rise up and break the backbone of your power, and I'll place it in the hands of a nation that doesn't even know my name.
[00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:49.966]  Be still and know that I'm God.
[00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:57.348]  Men will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
[00:23:58.408 --> 00:24:03.329]  Nations will not rise up against nations, neither shall they
[00:24:04.384 --> 00:24:13.540]  I ain't gonna study war anymore and I don't know about you I ain't gonna study war no more
[00:24:19.236 --> 00:24:26.019]  I have seen the most illogical, completely insane media brainwashing in the last three or four days I've ever seen in my life.
[00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:38.845]  This congressman, John Lewis, who was in the civil rights movement and got beat up by the police in 1965, is supposedly above the law and no one can dare criticize him because he was in the civil rights movement.
[00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:47.949]  He comes out and calls Donald Trump a Russian agent last week and says the Russians stole the election and Trump isn't legitimate and that Trump shouldn't be supported and should have his election overturned, basically.
[00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:50.070]  He calls on others to boycott his inauguration.
[00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:55.534]  And then Trump tweets at him, hey, we really need to fix the inner city communities and work on making America great again.
[00:24:56.114 --> 00:24:56.874]  Why don't you work with me?
[00:24:56.914 --> 00:24:57.615]  This isn't helping.
[00:24:57.995 --> 00:25:07.081]  And the media goes, oh my God, on Martin Luther King weekend, now it's the weekend, I think it's now he criticized him in the month of January or evil, he attacks a civil rights icon.
[00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:07.921]  What racism?
[00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:09.902]  So let's get this thing straight.
[00:25:10.062 --> 00:25:10.923]  He didn't attack
[00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:13.197]  John Lewis.
[00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:16.940]  John Lewis said that basically Donald Trump's a Russian spy.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.960]  That is fightin' words.
[00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:22.463]  Then the media takes it and extrapolates it because John Lewis is black.
[00:25:23.003 --> 00:25:26.465]  It was in the Civil Rights Movement that Donald Trump hates black people.
[00:25:26.806 --> 00:25:28.186]  That's in headlines all over the country.
[00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:32.589]  Blacks hurt by attack on John Lewis on Martin Luther King weekend.
[00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.531]  Man, this is just getting crazy.
[00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:39.816]  And you can see how the media just takes anything and turns it into something.
[00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:43.638]  This is truly the craziest crap I've ever seen.
[00:25:43.658 --> 00:25:51.582]  And I did some reports on this over the weekend, and I saw some of the commenters going, oh, you just don't like John Lewis, this is black.
[00:25:53.342 --> 00:25:59.085]  I mean, if it was a congressman that was white, or Senator Chuckie Schumer, or anybody who's been criticizing Trump, I'd go after him.
[00:25:59.105 --> 00:25:59.925]  This is just crazy.
[00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.247]  The media has made everything racial.
[00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:06.413]  It's John Lewis that went out in the arena.
[00:26:06.754 --> 00:26:10.856]  It's John Lewis that went out in a public place and shot his mouth off.
[00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:13.678]  It's John Lewis that defames somebody with no proof.
[00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:16.100]  That's a made up PPgate dossier.
[00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:26.247]  And then in this upside down social justice warrior snowflake world, Trump's bad because he responds and that's an attack.
[00:26:26.867 --> 00:26:29.749]  No, John Lewis attacked.
[00:26:31.479 --> 00:26:31.980]  Donald Trump.
[00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:34.024]  The congressman attacked the president.
[00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:36.369]  The president nicely responded.
[00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:39.264]  And then they made a big deal out of it.
[00:26:39.804 --> 00:26:42.185]  I mean, it just shows that it's the craziest crap.
[00:26:42.546 --> 00:26:45.087]  They must think the viewers and listeners are dumb, but they're not.
[00:26:45.127 --> 00:26:50.490]  It's why CNN and others don't have any audience, why the New York Times is collapsing, because people have common sense.
[00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.151]  They're like, John Lewis attacked Donald Trump.
[00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.732]  Donald Trump said, hey, work with me.
[00:26:53.772 --> 00:26:54.693]  This isn't constructive.
[00:26:55.193 --> 00:26:56.174]  That's not even an attack.
[00:26:56.454 --> 00:26:57.875]  Then they say he attacked him first.
[00:26:57.935 --> 00:27:01.817]  I mean, it's lies on top of lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[00:27:01.877 --> 00:27:04.338]  So I put out an article, a report titled
[00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:10.700]  John Lewis is a lying pile of garbage, using Trump's terms for BuzzFeed, and it's true.
[00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:13.781]  These are all just lying piles of garbage.
[00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:22.984]  I don't care what color they are, but the media covering for John Lewis is a lying pile of garbage.
[00:27:23.584 --> 00:27:24.544]  They're all going bankrupt.
[00:27:24.584 --> 00:27:25.164]  Nobody reads them.
[00:27:25.205 --> 00:27:25.845]  Nobody likes them.
[00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:27.485]  So that's what you call a pile of garbage.
[00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:28.485]  I'm just calling it like it is.
[00:27:28.906 --> 00:27:30.206]  Alex Jones for InfoWars.com.
[00:27:35.805 --> 00:27:37.507]  This is a protest.
[00:27:38.468 --> 00:27:40.231]  And this is a riot.
[00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:44.436]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:27:57.028 --> 00:28:02.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a final report until I'm broadcasting live tomorrow back in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:18.055]  There is an investigative journalist report by Sheppard Ambulance and Infowars.com with exclusive video of basically communists that are being funded by Soros and others meeting at all places, comic ping pong pizza that's run by David Brock's boyfriend of media matters.
[00:28:19.122 --> 00:28:22.505]  Planning to release a form of acid into the air tank vents in D.C.
[00:28:22.525 --> 00:28:24.726]  to shut down the deplorable that I'm scheduled to speak at.
[00:28:25.407 --> 00:28:26.928]  Now, this should be international news right now.
[00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:29.570]  Imagine if a right-winger or a libertarian or a patriot was doing this.
[00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:46.062]  But instead, there'll be radio and TV silence on this because the federal government is still controlled by literal enemies that see the American people as their enemy and who hate the American people who actually produce and pay taxes and that pay for these parasites.
[00:28:46.623 --> 00:28:48.224]  This is normal psychology in criminals.
[00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:50.992]  To hate those they're actually living off of.
[00:28:52.613 --> 00:29:04.361]  Now understand, if we're picking up this type of chatter and confirmed Soros being quote operatives $2,500 a day to go out and cause mayhem, imagine what we're not picking up.
[00:29:04.421 --> 00:29:07.062]  Imagine what we're not documenting or what our undercover people
[00:29:08.443 --> 00:29:15.709]  The HUMET, the individual intelligence operatives that have taken action as organic people to resist this tyranny.
[00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:18.391]  Imagine if we're catching all this chatter.
[00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:22.654]  Imagine what else we're missing is my point.
[00:29:23.234 --> 00:29:24.996]  So now is the time for maximum vigilance.
[00:29:25.036 --> 00:29:28.778]  We don't just need the great folks of Bikers for Trump to be there.
[00:29:28.878 --> 00:29:29.439]  I'm going to be there.
[00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:31.300]  We need everybody to come to DC.
[00:29:32.601 --> 00:29:38.364]  To videotape and document and surveil everything that is happening.
[00:29:39.764 --> 00:29:45.547]  That way the globalists may not execute their nastier plans if they know we're watching and they know we're involved.
[00:29:45.587 --> 00:29:47.207]  This is a critical juncture for the Republic.
[00:29:47.688 --> 00:29:48.368]  Four days out.
[00:29:48.548 --> 00:29:49.808]  Everybody must get to D.C.
[00:29:49.848 --> 00:29:50.049]  now.
[00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:51.669]  I'm traveling there on Wednesday.
[00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:55.391]  They're about to shut the cabin door here, so I'm traveling back to the States right now.
[00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:58.992]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, reporting from the road, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:02.373]  We've never had more important reports that are on the site right now.
[00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:05.554]  And David Knight in studio and the rest of the crew breaking all this down.
[00:30:05.994 --> 00:30:08.275]  This is such a critical time, I cannot stress that enough.
[00:30:08.775 --> 00:30:24.140]  We need human intelligence operatives of the Republic to just be out there with their hidden cameras, with their video cameras, with their cell phones, documenting what the scumbags are doing at all these different facilities and bars that they go to to plan their criminal activity and their terrorism.
[00:30:25.083 --> 00:30:28.087]  If we expose them, this thing will blow up in their face like everything else they've been doing.
[00:30:28.367 --> 00:30:29.588]  That's why they're failing on every front.
[00:30:30.129 --> 00:30:32.472]  Because now, we're finally standing up and resisting.
[00:30:32.852 --> 00:30:33.533]  And so they're failing.
[00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:38.179]  Before we just laid down like they were the establishment and they were invincible, so we always lost.
[00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:40.982]  Now that we're standing up, they're failing every time.
[00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:41.803]  So I salute you all.
[00:30:42.406 --> 00:30:48.989]  Of every race, color, and creed, now is the time to take action as humans with red blood against the technocrats, against the eugenicists, against the globalists.
[00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.772]  But again, the story about Sheppard Ambulance is on Infowars.com and needs to go viral.
[00:30:54.132 --> 00:31:00.135]  And look at all the other articles on the site as different groups are planting mayhem and violence there in an attempt to overthrow the will of the people.
[00:31:00.175 --> 00:31:01.376]  This is anti-democratic.
[00:31:01.836 --> 00:31:02.857]  This is fascistic.
[00:31:02.877 --> 00:31:05.158]  They always call themselves liberals or leftists, but really what it is
[00:31:05.638 --> 00:31:06.959]  Unfortunately, you've grown up
[00:31:34.417 --> 00:31:42.363]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:31:42.683 --> 00:31:44.905]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:31:44.925 --> 00:31:47.206]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:31:47.807 --> 00:31:50.589]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.812]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:31:54.972 --> 00:31:58.554]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:00.656]  Everything that's been done
[00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:18.362]  With torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:32:19.763 --> 00:32:20.203]  That's it.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:29.862]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:34.363]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:32:34.723 --> 00:32:43.325]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:32:43.785 --> 00:32:45.746]  This is all about converting us
[00:32:46.286 --> 00:33:03.553]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T. Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:07.915]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.729]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:31.567]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.

[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:59.372]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.321]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.241]  It's like lightning in a bottle!
[00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:10.022]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:36:10.382 --> 00:36:18.125]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:50.437]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:53.859]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:57.862]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:58.063 --> 00:37:00.145]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:07.171]  Well, today is Martin Luther King Day, the day that we honor the civil rights movement.
[00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:12.676]  And of course, the hacks Chuck Todd and John Lewis knew that.
[00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:19.122]  That's why they picked a Twitter fight with Donald Trump, calling him illegitimate, saying that he was going to boycott the inauguration.
[00:37:20.319 --> 00:37:24.321]  The guy that really got the election hacked on him, of course, is Bernie Sanders.
[00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:27.562]  And Bernie Sanders came out today and said, I will be attending the inauguration.
[00:37:27.582 --> 00:37:31.364]  And all this talk about President Trump being illegitimate is just words.
[00:37:31.404 --> 00:37:33.525]  He said, I'm focused on policies.
[00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:36.366]  I want to make sure that Trump does some of the things that he said he's going to do.
[00:37:36.386 --> 00:37:39.407]  I want to work with him in areas where we have agreement, that sort of thing.
[00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:45.190]  And if you understand John Lewis, you understand his role 50 years ago in this movement.
[00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.131]  Yes, there were some important things that were done.
[00:37:47.711 --> 00:37:56.198]  But he's turned a blind eye to some villains, and he's come after people unjustly in the past, just like he's come after Donald Trump.
[00:37:56.218 --> 00:37:58.701]  He compared McCain to George Wallace.
[00:37:58.721 --> 00:38:00.722]  He said Romney would bring back segregation.
[00:38:00.963 --> 00:38:05.587]  He even came after Bernie Sanders himself this last year in the election and said, I never saw him.
[00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:07.030]  During the Civil Rights Movement.
[00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.470]  Well, did you see Morris Dees?
[00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.332]  The guy who profited from the Civil Rights Movement?
[00:38:12.213 --> 00:38:27.002]  After his only involvement was to defend the Ku Klux Klan that attacked the Freedom Riders that John Lewis organized and burned their buses, then he profited from that hate as he put himself out as a prophet of hate.
[00:38:27.102 --> 00:38:29.904]  Here's that report from two years ago that talked about this.
[00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:37.373]  The Southern Poverty Law Center has long been the think tank hatching the idea of vast right-wing conspiracies.
[00:38:37.754 --> 00:38:48.441]  SPLC is the source behind some of the most outrageous enemies lists being compiled by Homeland Security, fusion centers like the MIAC report, and emails and policy statements by the military.
[00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:58.709]  SPLC creates the boogeyman, writes the script, and Homeland passes it off to the police, who are trained to associate political speech with a threat to their personal safety.
[00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:00.850]  And it's not just political speech.
[00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:05.032]  Southern Poverty Law Center is attacking religious freedom, calling it hate.
[00:39:05.653 --> 00:39:08.535]  This line of attack has been promulgated within the military.
[00:39:09.155 --> 00:39:16.239]  The free exercise religion of those in the military is being attacked as not just hateful, but conflated with the racism of the KKK.
[00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:22.803]  It's an interesting comparison for the SPLC to make, since it got its start in the violent racist confrontations of the 60s.
[00:39:23.364 --> 00:39:28.547]  On May 20th, 1961, when a busload of black and white freedom riders arrived in Montgomery, Alabama,
[00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:34.969]  They were met with what Time Magazine described as an idiot club-swinging mob of about a hundred.
[00:39:35.269 --> 00:39:39.491]  In this picture, we see SPLC founder Morris Dease's first client.
[00:39:40.071 --> 00:39:42.732]  The man on the ground with the camera getting kicked by Klansman?
[00:39:43.312 --> 00:39:45.233]  That's not Morris Dease's client.
[00:39:45.793 --> 00:39:47.594]  This is Dease's client.
[00:39:48.334 --> 00:39:53.877]  Deese didn't defend the Freedom Riders who were viciously attacked, bloodied, and had their bus set on fire.
[00:39:54.438 --> 00:39:57.319]  Deese defended the KKK thug, the ringleader.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.663]  And he got him off in spite of it being widely reported like this article in Life Magazine.
[00:40:03.143 --> 00:40:10.287]  And Morris Deese got paid a lot of money, $5,000, which at the time was the median family income for a year.
[00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:14.190]  But this is what his bio on the SPLC website says.
[00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:21.438]  After launching a law practice in Montgomery in 1960, he won a series of groundbreaking civil rights cases.
[00:40:22.098 --> 00:40:29.126]  Maybe he should amend that to say that he won for the Klan a leg-breaking case against civil rights activists.
[00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:31.169]  Maybe it wasn't a moral epiphany, but a financial epiphany.
[00:40:45.487 --> 00:40:50.251]  He could make much more money doing direct mail fundraising to the public than he could suing.
[00:40:50.831 --> 00:41:01.961]  Criticisms of the SPLC from the left focus on how little it does other than fundraising, how much money it hoards for its endowment, and how much money it pays multi-millionaire Morris Dees.
[00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:05.764]  Alexander Cockburn described Dees and the SPLC this way.
[00:41:06.204 --> 00:41:07.865]  Ever since 1971, U.S.
[00:41:07.925 --> 00:41:21.313]  Postal Service mailbags have bulged with Deese's fundraising letters, scaring dollars out of the pockets of trembling liberals aghast at his lurid depictions of hate-sodden America in dire need of legal confrontation by the SPLC.
[00:41:21.893 --> 00:41:27.717]  Cochran wrote in 2009 how Deese and the SPLC were spinning the election of Barack Obama.
[00:41:28.217 --> 00:41:33.522]  What is the arch-salesman of hate-mongering, Mr. Morris Dees, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, doing now?
[00:41:34.043 --> 00:41:37.166]  He's saying that the election of a black president proves his point.
[00:41:37.566 --> 00:41:38.828]  Hate is on the rise.
[00:41:39.148 --> 00:41:39.909]  Send money!
[00:41:40.169 --> 00:41:48.818]  Without skipping a beat, the mail-shot moguls who, year after year, make money selling the notion there's been a right resurgence out there in the hinterland, with massed legions of haters,
[00:41:49.318 --> 00:42:04.874]  ...have used the election of a black president to say that, yes, hate is on the rise in America, ready to burst apart at the seams, with millions of extremists primed to march down Main Street draped in Klan robes, a copy of Mein Kampf tucked under one arm, and a Bible under the other.
[00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:10.659]  A high-profile case from 1977 shows the true nature of Morris Dees and the SPLC.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:21.790]  After Dees and the SPLC hired Millard Farmer to defend five black men accused of murder, Farmer said Dees abruptly pulled out of the case, telling him that the case wasn't making any money for the SPLC.
[00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:28.156]  When Farmer refused to turn the case over to a public defender, Dees sued him for improperly spending SPLC funds.
[00:42:28.456 --> 00:42:32.500]  But Farmer went public, talking about how SPLC funds are really used.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.540]  And he said of Dees,
[00:42:34.181 --> 00:42:40.385]  He's the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker of the Civil Rights Movement, though I don't mean to malign Jim and Tammy Faye.
[00:42:40.765 --> 00:42:42.226]  The analogy couldn't be better.
[00:42:42.706 --> 00:42:49.150]  The SPLC is a perfect way for liberals to assuage their guilt buying indulgences from the Church of Morris Dees.
[00:42:50.012 --> 00:42:57.658]  In 1996, USA Today called the SPLC the nation's richest civil rights organization, with $68 million in the bank account.
[00:42:57.918 --> 00:43:01.120]  It's now grown to $224 million.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.662]  It's easy to see how their endowment has soared.
[00:43:04.262 --> 00:43:14.810]  Alexander Cochran pointed out that in 2007, they took in $45 million, but only spent $21 million, spending only half of what they took in on their proclaimed mission, and pocketing the rest.
[00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:21.853]  And part of the expenditure was the lavish salary of multi-millionaire Morris Dees, who in 2010 was paid $350,000.
[00:43:22.113 --> 00:43:25.455]  How's that for Southern poverty?
[00:43:26.135 --> 00:43:30.057]  But ripping off guilty white liberals isn't what makes the SPLC dangerous.
[00:43:30.537 --> 00:43:40.042]  What makes them dangerous is when they partner with the government to intimidate dissenters, to threaten political speech, and to promote violence against those they demonize.
[00:43:40.822 --> 00:43:58.515]  Look at the notorious MIAC Fusion Center report, Missouri, 2009, where every supporter of limited constitutional government, every real political opponent of Obama, was labeled as a possible terrorist, a person of interest, simply for having a bumper sticker supporting Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin, or Bob Barr.
[00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:01.017]  Then there was the Hutteri militia case in Michigan.
[00:44:01.398 --> 00:44:07.142]  The government whipped the public into a panic about militias with the help of the media, using SPLC talking points.
[00:44:07.422 --> 00:44:08.343]  Mark, did you know about this group?
[00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:09.945]  Oh yeah.
[00:44:09.985 --> 00:44:14.910]  They look to be a very small group with a very odd ideology, sort of a twist on the New World Order.
[00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:25.200]  Basically, like other militia groups, what they really see happening to the world is a kind of takeover of the world by some sort of one world government, a so-called New World Order.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:32.747]  Their alleged plot to kill a police officer and then bomb the funeral procession afterward, the opening salvo allegedly of a war against the US government.
[00:44:32.827 --> 00:44:37.032]  The case was thrown out by the judge, but you didn't hear much, if anything, about that.
[00:44:37.612 --> 00:44:51.788]  Or take Floyd Corkins, who shot up the offices of the Family Research Council because he bought into the fundraising propaganda of the SPLC that if you assert your religious liberty to resist being coerced into recognizing and subsidizing homosexual marriage,
[00:44:52.369 --> 00:44:53.069]  The S.P.L.C.
[00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:54.650]  will label you as a hate group.
[00:44:54.891 --> 00:45:05.557]  The real hate group is the S.P.L.C., whose hate-mongering inspired Corkins to, quote, kill as many people as I could, then smear a Chick-fil-A sandwich on their face.
[00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:09.739]  And there have been multiple cases of the military repeating S.P.L.C.
[00:45:09.799 --> 00:45:17.284]  propaganda, labeling opposition to homosexual marriage mandates as hate, and the Founding Fathers as dangerous militia types.
[00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:27.734]  As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Boston bombing, we should remember how the SPLC was used to promote the idea that bombing was done by their favorite boogeyman, Patriots.
[00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:34.922]  It's conceivable that it was related to, in particular, this thing Patriots Day.
[00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:40.308]  It celebrates, of course, the American Revolutionary War, the first shots fired at Concord and Lexington.
[00:45:40.828 --> 00:45:55.073]  But in the world I cover, it is really, probably most importantly, the end of the debacle in Waco, where 80 people died in a fire, and two years later, payback for the events in Waco, the bombing of the Oklahoma City building.
[00:45:55.433 --> 00:46:00.815]  InfoWars exposed the Boston bombing as a false flag event designed to be blamed on patriots.
[00:46:01.277 --> 00:46:06.242]  Sir, why were loudspeakers telling people in New Orleans to be calm moments before the bomb went off?
[00:46:06.643 --> 00:46:10.607]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security?
[00:46:10.627 --> 00:46:12.769]  Are we sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.230]  No.
[00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:14.511]  Next question.
[00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:18.275]  Why were people being told prior... 9.30 tomorrow morning will be the next race.
[00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:30.384]  Two days later, the FBI postponed, then cancelled, a press conference where 100 reporters had gathered to hear about the suspects that CNN and other government spokesmen had been saying had been identified by the FBI.
[00:46:30.605 --> 00:46:37.330]  The FBI then waited another 24 hours before identifying two suspects that didn't fit the homegrown patriot terrorist narrative.
[00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.412]  Of course, we still haven't seen them even sitting the bags down.
[00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:50.897]  But we have seen the FBI murder a friend of the surviving suspect during questioning, shooting him six times and, once in the back of the head, execution style.
[00:46:51.277 --> 00:46:56.280]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is a powerful propaganda tool of the government in the War of Terror.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:02.263]  But if we can defeat them in the Info War, we can stop the shooting war for which the government is preparing.
[00:47:03.023 --> 00:47:11.170]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.378 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:02.296]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:17.303]  The country is in an all-out civil war against foreign multinational banks that believe they own it and control it.
[00:49:17.443 --> 00:49:23.805]  They're allied with the communist Chinese, the EU bureaucrats that have hijacked Europe, the Saudi Arabian Islamic Caliphate.
[00:49:24.246 --> 00:49:26.566]  This is truly World War IV.
[00:49:26.606 --> 00:49:29.587]  It's economic, it's cultural, and if you get military, any day.
[00:49:29.747 --> 00:49:34.269]  We are truly seeing the sad depths to which our nation has sunk, the criminal rogue elements
[00:49:34.569 --> 00:49:35.649]  We're good to go.
[00:50:01.374 --> 00:50:11.323]  It's a classic setup, like the one Karl Rove famously reportedly gave to Dan Rather to mess up his whole Texas National Guard story as a poison pill into the rest of the story that was actually true.
[00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:17.629]  I'm not a fan of Dan Rather overall, but compared to Rachel Maddow or other CIA operatives like Anderson Cooper, he's an angel.
[00:50:17.669 --> 00:50:23.235]  But instead of them backing off when Trump came out and said, you're fake news, and Time Warner stopped dipping.
[00:50:23.615 --> 00:50:24.136]  I think so.
[00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:44.636]  Now, folks are asking, is this from hackers 4chan and their spoofing board, their famous trolling board, the king of the trolls?
[00:50:44.956 --> 00:50:46.697]  Or is this opposition research?
[00:50:46.717 --> 00:50:47.397]  Well, it's both.
[00:50:47.437 --> 00:50:48.858]  This is opposition research.
[00:50:49.078 --> 00:50:50.819]  Mark Dice correctly called it two days ago.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:56.763]  This is opposition research where they just cook up a bunch of lies and a bunch of disinformation and start floating it out there.
[00:50:56.883 --> 00:51:01.086]  It then got floated on the web back before the Republican primaries over a year ago.
[00:51:01.106 --> 00:51:03.287]  We're talking, this happened like 16 months ago.
[00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:04.608]  This happened in late 2015.
[00:51:04.648 --> 00:51:06.549]  This is just incredible.
[00:51:06.749 --> 00:51:08.490]  It was the first time this stuff started floating around.
[00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:09.090]  I think?
[00:51:29.804 --> 00:51:30.104]  I think.
[00:51:44.872 --> 00:51:45.112]  I think so.
[00:52:05.486 --> 00:52:15.155]  Remember, John McCain publicly poses with al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters and is behind basically with Hillary, the entire Syria five-year nightmare and 300,000 dead.
[00:52:15.195 --> 00:52:29.928]  This is a monstrous creature who hasn't found a war he doesn't like, so he is a mad dog, just insanely arrogant, out of control, up on the Intelligence Committee, taking a 4chan dossier that was obviously, well, they now admit
[00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:30.288]  Yeah.
[00:52:48.063 --> 00:52:48.703]  We're getting rid of.
[00:52:49.024 --> 00:52:55.949]  So this is very, very serious when you see them involved because they see the United States as part of their larger empire.
[00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:58.411]  They made deals in the 20s to merge the British Empire.
[00:52:58.431 --> 00:53:00.893]  That's what the Council of Foreign Relations is all about.
[00:53:00.953 --> 00:53:05.897]  So this is, this is the maximum moment of crisis for this country and the world.
[00:53:18.773 --> 00:53:23.178]  I have the cover of USA Today here in front of me with their weekend edition.
[00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:26.022]  Trump's cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[00:53:26.042 --> 00:53:29.886]  That's right, they're going to disrupt the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:30.267 --> 00:53:33.811]  And all the things Trump is delivering on in spades.
[00:53:34.171 --> 00:53:42.516]  And he has committed to the American people, he's committed to me, I'm just leaving it at that so the media doesn't have another heyday with it, that he's going to deliver, or basically, die trying.
[00:53:42.576 --> 00:53:43.816]  He is going all out.
[00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:55.603]  And that's why we're seeing this unprecedented move, this unprecedented move right now to disrupt the inauguration and to actually try to sell the American people on an overthrow of Trump.
[00:53:55.643 --> 00:54:00.946]  The establishment, the globalists are trying to convince themselves that they can try some coup, but remember,
[00:54:01.506 --> 00:54:08.829]  In the last month, I've been warning you that they're trying to launch a Continued Government, COG, basically Operation Valkyrie.
[00:54:08.909 --> 00:54:15.551]  They used COG in 1944 to try to kill Hitler, their Continued Government system, but it backfired.
[00:54:15.611 --> 00:54:18.912]  Well, they've turned that around now and are acting like Trump is illegitimate.
[00:54:18.952 --> 00:54:24.994]  They're trying to sell COG through rogue groups in the government to convince them that what they're doing is okay and normal.
[00:54:25.314 --> 00:54:30.436]  And I've said the left is openly behind the scenes calling for martial law and the arrest
[00:54:30.816 --> 00:54:31.176]  I think so.
[00:54:49.838 --> 00:54:50.218]  I don't know.
[00:55:12.931 --> 00:55:21.073]  Just three weeks ago, I had a talking point that they put out that I put a lot of attention on, where they said, civil emergency, national emergency.
[00:55:21.173 --> 00:55:23.533]  I then talked to my sources at CNN.
[00:55:23.693 --> 00:55:25.794]  We also have sources inside ABC News.
[00:55:25.854 --> 00:55:26.934]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:55:27.094 --> 00:55:40.417]  And they said that they are seriously wargaming, just like they got caught before the Gulf War both times, in 1991 and 2003, wargaming the attacks with the exact targets drilled beforehand with a seamless integration of
[00:55:41.437 --> 00:55:41.717]  I think?
[00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:00.759]  We're good to go.
[00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:19.293]  It doesn't intend to go that route because they are the deep state.
[00:56:19.393 --> 00:56:20.754]  They are actually the foreigners.
[00:56:20.934 --> 00:56:22.034]  They're actually the globalists.
[00:56:22.074 --> 00:56:25.556]  They're actually the people that have infiltrated the government and are overthrowing our republic.
[00:56:25.596 --> 00:56:27.377]  Trump is returning the republic.
[00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:32.881]  Trump is trying to disrupt the globalist operation to impoverish us and make us vassal slaves.
[00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:39.945]  I was told over a month ago by sources inside CNN, inside ABC, and others, they said, Alex, you are dead on.
[00:56:40.285 --> 00:56:41.926]  We're up here wargaming.
[00:56:42.646 --> 00:56:57.936]  Civil unrest in and around the inauguration, Trump being arrested, Trump being indicted, the news announcing he's a Russian spy, basically overthrowing the president, putting it into a constitutional crisis, and a national emergency being declared.
[00:56:58.157 --> 00:57:10.565]  It's been intensifying with these rogue intelligence agencies coming out with reports that Russians turned off the East Coast power, or that Russians planned to turn off the East Coast, or that they had a laptop, and then, okay, the laptop didn't even have the software on it.
[00:57:10.785 --> 00:57:11.628]  It's all totally made up.
[00:57:11.709 --> 00:57:13.415]  We've seen hoax after hoax after hoax.
[00:57:22.152 --> 00:57:23.472]  That's going to do it for us for tonight.
[00:57:23.552 --> 00:57:25.213]  Be sure to check us out all week long.
[00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:30.936]  We have Alex Jones, Rob Dew, Owen Shroyer, Millie Weaver on the ground in Washington DC covering the inauguration.
[00:57:31.256 --> 00:57:32.696]  It's going to be insane.
[00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:37.399]  We'll be live for at least 14 hours and be sure to tune in to the Alex Jones Show tomorrow.
[00:57:37.799 --> 00:57:48.884]  He is going to be breaking that report, the persecution of the press at 1.30 Central Standard Time and also James O'Keefe dropping part two of that explosive inauguration undercover video.
[00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:58.513]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:57:58.533 --> 00:58:01.994]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:58:02.034 --> 00:58:06.857]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:58:06.877 --> 00:58:09.798]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:58:09.898 --> 00:58:15.841]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:19.626]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:58:20.067 --> 00:58:22.650]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:31.282]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:58:32.333 --> 00:58:41.059]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:46.303]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:58:46.824 --> 00:58:50.526]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:58:50.586 --> 00:58:52.628]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:55.110]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:57.551]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:58:57.912 --> 00:58:58.992]  InfoWars.com
[00:59:04.137 --> 00:59:09.920]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
